Preface 



Ihc present volume has been pre[)ared with the ^aeatest care 
and It can be reUed on as one of the best of its kind Fverv 
recipe has been tried and tested, and will be found to meet the 
iv juirements of housekeepers of all classes. The book embodies 
many original and commendable features, amon^ which is the 
dinunation of the use of alcohol. It can l)e clearly demonstrated 
tliat spirituous liquors are not required in cookin>,'. 

It cannot l)e denied that an improved svstem of practical 
domestic cookery, and a better knowled-e of its first principles 
are still much needed in this country. The influence of diet unori 
health IS indeed a :bject of far deeper importance than ^t 
usually appears to be asidered, if wc may judge by the profound 
;ndi(terence with which it is commonly treated. It has occuijie(; 
It IS true, the earnest attention of manv emimnt men of scienc' 
■.cveral of whom have recently investigated it with the most patient 
and aoonous research. The results ol whicli thev have made known 
U. the world in their writings, accompanied, in some instances 
l.y information of the highest value as to the most profitable and 
nutritious modes of prejjaring various kinds of viands. 

It is a popular error to imagine that what is called good cookery 
IS adapted only to the establishments of the wealthy, and that it 
H l)eyond the reach of those who are not affluent. On the con- 
trary, it is of the utmost conse(|uence that the food wh^'ch is 
served at the more simply supplied tables of the middle classe' 
^ lould all be well and skillfully prepared. Particularly as it is froni 
these classes that the men principally emanate to whose indefatig- 
able industry, high intelligence, and active genius, we are mainly 
indebted for our advancement in science, in art, in literature and 
in general civilisation. \Vhen both body and mind are exhaust.-d 
oy uie toils ol the day, heavy or unsuitable food, so far from re- 
cruiting their enfeebled powers, prostrates the energies more 
completely, and acts in every way injuriously upon tlie system' 
And It IS no exaggeration to add that many a valuable life has

CHAPTER I. 

SMALL POIPyiTS OF TABLE ETIQUETTE 

Dm.Kacv of manner at taljh; stamps Ijotli man and woman, for one 
can, at a glance, discern whether a |)er>on has been trained to eat 
well— /.r., to hold the knife ami fork properly, to eat without the 
slightest sound of the !ii).s, to drink quietly, to use tlie napkin rightly 
to make no noise with any of the implements of the table, and^last 
but not least, to eat slowly and masticate tlie food thoroughly •Ml 
these points should be most carefully taught to ( hildren, and then 
they will always feel at their ea>e at the grandest tables in the land 
I here is no position where the innate refinement of a person is more 
fully exhibited than at the table, and nowhere that those who haye 
not be.-n trainc-d m table etiquette feel more keenly their deficiencies 
I he knite should ne\er lie used to carry food to the mouth, but only 
to cut it up int.j small mouthfuls ; then place it upon the plate at one 
side, and take the fork in the right hand, and eat all the food with it 
When both haye been used finally, they sh.juld be laid dia<'onally 
across the plate, with both handles towards the right hand •''this is 
understood by well-trained waiters, to be the signal for removing 
them, together with the plate. 

ije careful to keep the mouth shut closely while masticating the 
lood. It is the opening of the lips which < auses the smacking whi. 1, 
seems yery disgusting. Chew your food well, but do it silently, and 
be ( aivful to take small mouthfuls. The knife can be used to cut the 



>ery indelicate. At m 



irc not neaitiiiul, anil appear^

a. loss your lap in such a manner that it will not slide ofif upon the 
iloor; a gentleman should place it across his right knee. Do not 
lu. k It into your neck, like a child's bib. For an old person, however 
It IS well to attach the napkin to a napkin hook and slip it into the 
\<-t or dress buttonholes, to pnjtect their K-'irments, or sew a broad 
tape at two paces on the napkin, and pass it over the head. When 
the soup IS eaten, wipe the mouth carefully with the napkin, and use 
u to wipe the hands after meals. 

Spoons are sometimes used with tlrm puddings, but forks are the 
hetler style. .\ spoon should never be turned over in the mouth 

Ladies have frecpiently an atVected way of holding the knife half- 
uay down Its length, as if it were too big for their little hands ; but 
n^Ms as awkward a way a^ it i. weak ; the knifb should be grasped 
luvly by the handle only, the forefinger being the only one to touch 
the blade, and that only al.mg the back of the blade at its root, and 
no further d(nvn. 

M the rotKliision of a course, where thoy base been used, knife and 
tork should be laid side by side across the middle of the plate—never 
crossed ; the old custom of < nw.ing them was in (obedience to an 
ancient religious formula. The servant should offer everything at the 
Irft of the guest, that the guest may be at liberty to use the right hand 
If one has been given a napkin ring, it is nece.sarv to fold one's 
napkin and use the ring ; otherwise the napkin should be left unfoldetl 
<)i.es teeth are not to be picked at table ; but if it is impossible iu 
liiiuler It, It should be done behind the napkin. 

One may pi. k a bone at the table, but, as with corn, only one hand 
^^ allourd to touch It ; yet one can usually get enough from it with 
knife and fork, which is certainly the more elegant wav ni .loing ; and 
to take her teeth to it gives a lady the look of caring a' little too much 
for the pleasures of the table ; one is, howe\er, on no account to suck 
one s finger after it. 

Wherever there is any doubt as to the best way to do a thin- it is 
v.i.e to follow that which is the most rational, a'nd that will almost 
nnanably be found to be proper etiquette. To Ik- at ease is a great 
Mep t..waids enjoying your own dinner; and making yourself a-ree- 
aMe to the company. There is a reason for everything in polite 
i!>age ; lluis the reason why one does not blou a thing to cool it is 
not only that it is an inelegant and vulgar action intrin.i. ally, but be- 
cause it may be ofiensive toothers-can not help being .0', indeed • 
and It, moreover implies haste, which, whether from '.^icdine^s or a' 
'•vsire to get away, is equally objectionable. Everthmg else may be 
a^ easily traced to its origin in the fit and becoming. 

II, to c:onclude, one seats one's self properly a't table, and takes 
reason into account, one will do t(,lerably well. One must not pull 
"nes , hair too closely to the table, for the natural result of that is the 

■ liability to use one's knife ;nif! fml- ,..;.Ko"t ^nrnr

to touch any of the dishes ; if a member of the family, one can

Cll.M'TKK V. 

CARVING 

Cauvinc; is one important aci|ui>iiiion in the routine of daily hving, 
and all should try to attain a knowledge or ability to do it well, and 
withal gracefully. 

When carving use a chair slightly higher than the ordinary si^e, as 
it gives a better purchase on the meat, and appears more graceful 
than when standing, as is often quite necessary when carving a 
turkey, or a very large joint. More depends on skill than stren;^th. 
The ])latter should be placed oi)pnsite, and sufficiently near to give 
perfect command ol tlic arti( 1<- to he < ar\ed, the knife of medium >ize, 
^har]) with a keen edge. Commence by cutting the slices thin, laying 
them carefully to one side of the platter, then afterwards placing the 
desired annnrnt on each guest's plate, to be served in turn by the 
servant. 

In carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes; 
for if these are broken the beauty of the fish is lost. The carver 
should acquaint himself with the choicest parts and morsels ; and to 
give each guest an ecpial share of those tidbits should be his maxim. 
Steel knives and forks should (jn no account be used in helping fish, 
a> these are liable to impart a -rvrt' disagreeable flavour. A fish- 
irowel of silver or plated silver is the proper article to use. 

(iravies should be sent to the table \ery liot^ an ' n helping one to 
gravy or melted butter, jilace it on a vacant side v.. the plate ; not 
pi'Ur it over their meat, fish or fowl, that they may use only as much 
as they like. 

When serving fowls, or meat, accomjjanied with stuffing, the guests 
should be asked if they would have a portion, as it is not every one 
to whom the flavour of stufTmg is agreeuble ; in filling their plates, 
avoid heaping one thing u])(jn another, as it makes a bad aj)- 
pe.uance. 

A word about the care of carving knives : a fine steel knife should 
not come in contact with intense heat, because it destroys its temper, 
and therefore impairs its cutting qualities. Table carving knives 
should not be used in the kitchen, either around the fire, or for

The choice of \enison should be judged l)y tlie fat, which, when tlie 
venison is young, sliould be thick, clear and close, and the meat a 
very dark rcil. The tlesh of a female deer, about four years old, is 
the sweetest and best of venison. 

Puck venison, which is in season from June to the end of September, 
is finer than doe venison, which is in season from October to December. 
Neither should be dressed at any other time of year, anil no meat 
requires so much care as venison in killing, preserving, and dressing. 

SIRLOIN OF BEEF. 

This choice roasting-picce should be cut with one good firm stroke 
from end to end of the joint, at the upper part, in thin, long, even 
slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, cutting across the grain, 
serving each guest with some of the fat with the lean ; this may 1)e 
done by cutting a smali ihm -^lice from uiuienieaili tiie i)one from 5 to

Another way of carving this piece, and which will be of great 
assistance in doing it well, is to insert the knife just above the bone at

easily and cleanly done if the carving knife is first run alon- between

to carve, unless it is clone properly. To attempt to carve each chop and 
serve it, you would not only plai foo laryc a piece upon the plate of 
the person you intend to serve ; at you would waste much time, and 
should the \crtebr;e have ntjt i)een removed by the butt her, you 
would be c(MiiiJclled to exercise such a degree of strength that would 
make one's appearance very ungraceful, and possibly, too, throwing 
gravy over your neighbour sitting next to you. The correct way to 
carve this roast is to cut di.igonaily from figure I to 2, and help in 
slices of modeiate thickness ; then it may be cut from 3 to 4, in 
order to separate the small bones; divide and serve them, having 
first incjuired if they arc desired. 

This joint is usually sent to the table accompanied by bacon, ham, 
tongue, or pickled pork on a separate dish and with a cut lemon on a 
plate. There are also a number of sauces that are suitable with thi=, 
roast. 




LEG OF MUTTON. 

The best mutton, and that from which most nourishment is obtained 
is that of sheep from three to six years old, and which have been fed 
on dry sweet pastures ; then mutton is in its prime, the flesh being 
firm, juicy, dark colored, and full of the richest gravy. When mutton 
is two years old, the meat is flabby, pale and savourless. 

In carving a roasted leg, the best slices are found by cutting quite 
down to the bone, in the direction from i to 2, and slices may be 
taken from either side. 

Some very good cuts are taken from the broad end from 5 to 6, and 
the fat on this ridge is very much liked by many. The cramp-bone 
is a delicacy, and is obtained by cutting down to the bone at 4, and 
runnin'' the knife under it m a semicircular direction to '. Th" 
nearer the knuckle the drier the meat, but the under side contains 
the most finely grained meat, from which slices may be cut length- 
wise. When sent to the table a frill of paper around the knuckle 
will improve its appearance.

HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

A haunch of vension is the /rzw^ joint, and is carved very similar 
to almost any roasted or boiltd leg ; it should be first cut crosswise 
down to the bone following the line from i to 2 ; then turn the platter 
with the knuckle farthest from you, put in the point of the knife, and 
cut down as far as you can, in the directions shown by the dotted 
lines from 3 to 4 ; then there can be taken out as many slices as is 
jetjuiicd on the right and ieil ol this. Slices of venison should be 
cut thin, and gravy given with them, but as there is a special sauce 
made with red wine and currant jelly to accompany this meat, do not 
serve gravy before asking the guest if he pleases to have any.

DESCRIl'TION OF I'AKTS 



J' 



To carve a goose, first begin by separating the leg from the budv, 
by putting the fork into the small end of the limb, pressing ^t closely 
to the body, then passing the knife under at 2, and turning the leg 
back as you cut througli the joint. To take off the wing, insert the 
fork in the sniall end of the pinion, and press it close to the body; 
put the knife in at figure i, and divide the joint. When the legs and 
wings are off, the breast may l)e carved in long even slices, as 
represented in the lines from i to 2. The bac k and" lower side bones, 
as well as the two lower side bones by the wing, may be cut off; but 
the best pieces of the goose are the breast and thighs, after being 
separated from the drum-sticks. Serve a little of the dressing fr(jm 
the inside, by making a circular slice in' the apron at figure 3. A 
goose should never be over a year old ; a tinigh goo^e is very difficult 
to carve, and certainly mo>t diffic uit to eat. 

FOWLS. 

First insert the knife Innween the leg and the bodv, and cut to the 
bone ; then turn the leg back with the fork, antl it the fowl is tender 
the joint will give way easily. The wing is broken off the same 
way, only dividing the joint with the knife, in the direction from i to 2. 
The fore cpiarters having been removed in this way, t.ike off the 
merry-th(;ught and the neck-bones ; these last are to be removed by 
putting the knife at figure 3 and 4, pressing it hard, when they will 
break ofi" from the part that sticks to the brea>i. To separate the 
breast from the body of the fowl, cut through the tender ribs t lose to 
the breast, cpnte down to the tail. Now turn the fowl over, back 
upwards ; put the knife into the bone midway between the neck and 
the rump, and on raising the lower end ii uill'separate readily. Turn 
now the rump from you, and take off very neatly the two side-bones 
and the fowl is carved. In sepaiatin- the- thigh 'from the drum-stick, 
the knife must be inserted exactly at the joint, for if not accurately hit, 
some difficulty w ill be e\j)erienced to get them apart ; this is easily ac- 
c]uired by practice. There is no difference in carving roast and boiled 
fowls if full grown ; but in very young fowls, the breast is usually served 
whole ; the wings and brea-i are considered the best jiart, but in young 
ones the legs are the most juicy. In the case of a capon or large fowl, 
slices may be cut off at the Inea-t, the same as carving a pheasant. 





ROAST DUCK. 

A young duckling n.ay be carved in the same manner as a fowl, 
the legs and wings being taken off first on either side. When the 
duck io fi/il size, carvc u like a goose; first cutting it in slices t'rom 
the breast, beginning close to the wing and procee<ling upward towards 
the breast bone, as is represented by the lines i to 2. An opening 
may be made, by cutting out a circular slice as shown by the dotted 
lines at number 3.

DKSCKII'TION OF PARTS 



Son..- an- fond of tin- fcc-t, and when drcssin},' the duck, these should 
be neatly .kinncd and never removed. Wild di„k is highly esteemed 
by epicures ; it is trussed like a tame duck, and carv(;d in the .same 
manner, the breast beini^ the ( hoi<cst part. 

PARTRIDGES. 

i'artnd-es are K^'ncr.illy cle;in<'d acd trussed the same way as a 
pheasant, but the custom of cooking them with the heads on is eoinir 
into disuse somewhat. The usual way of ( .Irving them is similar to :i 
piKeon, dividing it into two equal parts. Another meiho.l is to cut it 
mto thref pieces, by severing a win^ and Ick on either side from the 
body, by lollowinK the lines i to 2, thus making two servings of those 
parts, leaving the breast for a third iilate. The third method is to 
thrust back the body from the leRS, and < ut throuKh thr middle of the 
breast, thus makuiK four portions that may be siMved. (irouse are 
carved from the breast when they are larye; and ipiartered (ir halved 
wlien of medium si/e. 




PHEASAiTT. 
Place your fork tnnily in the centre of the breast of this lar-e K'tme 
hire ami < ut deep slices to the bone at figure i and 2 ; then '"take off 
the Ick m the line from 3 and 4 and the win^ 3 and 5, severing both si.les 
the same. In taking off the wings, be careful not to cut t.x, near the 
neck ; if y.ju do you will hit upon the neck-bone, from which the wintr 
must be seiKiratird. i'ass the knife through the line (^, and under the 
merry-thought towards the neck, which will detach it. Cut the other 
parts as in a lowl. The breast, wings, and merrv-thou-ht of a 
pheasan- are the must highly prized, although the legs'are considered 
very mely flavoured. Pheasants are frequently roasted with the 
head left on ; in that case when dressing them, l)ring the head round 
under tiie wmg, and h\ it on the point of a skever. 



PIGEONS. 



very good way 



. <jf carving these birds is to insert the knife at 
hgure I, and cut both wa> s to 2 and 3, when each portion may be 
divided into two pieces then served. Pigeons, if not too large, may 
be cut in halves, either across or down the middle, cutting them into 
iNvo etpial parts; if young and small they mav be served entirely 



whole.

of small birds, such as pigeons, ([uails, woodcock, squabs, snipe, etc. 
These small birds are either servetl whole or split down the back 
iiiakinj^ two servings. 




MACKEREL. 

The nuu kerel is one of the nici-.t be.iutiful of fish, being known by 
tiicir silvery whiteness. It sometimes attains to the length of twenty 
inches, but usu.illy, when fully grown, is about fourteen or sixteen 
inches long, and about two jjounds in weight. To carve a baked 
mackerel, fust remove the head and tail l)y i utting downward at 
1 and 2 ; then split them down the back, so as to serve e.u h person 
a jvart of each side piec e. The roe should be divided in sm.iU pieces 
and served with each piece of fish. Other whole fish may be carved 
in the same m, inner. The fish is laid upon a little sauce or folded 
napkin, on a hot dish, and ;>;arnished with parsley. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Tills tl>h is seldom sent to the table wliole, bc-ing too large for any 
oidinary sized family ; the- middle c ut is considered the choicest to 
boil. To c.irve it, fust run the knife clown .and .along the upper side 
of the tish from i tc) 2, then again on the lower side fiom 3 to 4. 
Serve the thick p.art, i utting it leiiglliwise in slices in the direction of 
the line from i tcj 2, .and the thin p.irt bie.adtlusise, or in the direction 
from 5 to 6. .V slice of the thi( k with om of the thin, where lies the 
fat, should lie ser\ed to each guest. Care siiould be taken when 
( arving not to lire.ik the flakes of the fish, ;is th.it impairs its appear- 
ance. The flesh of the s.iliiion is lii h and clc:lic ions in flavour. 
S.ilmon is in season from the tirst of Feljiu.ny to the end cjf .August.

SOUPS. 

CONSOMMK. or Slock, forms the; b.isis of all meat soups, and also of 
all principal sauces. It is, therefore, essential to the success of these 
culinary operations to know the most ccjmplete and economical method 
of extracting from a certain cpLintity of meat the best possible stock or 
broth. Fresh uncooked beef makes the best stock, with the addition 
of cracked bones, as the glutinous matter contained in them renders 
it important that they should be boiled with the meat, which adds to 
the strength and thickness of the soup. They are composed of an 
rjirthv substances — to which, thev owe their sohditv — of "elatine^ and 
a fatty fluid, something like marrcnv. 'Ju'o cu/icfs of them contain .as 
much gelatine as one pound o( iwQixi ; but in them, this is so encased 
in the earthy substance, that boiling water can dissolve only the 
surface of the whole bones, but by breaking them they can be

(Irated carrtjt gives a fine ainlicr colour to soup; it must be put in 
as soon as the soup is free from sc urn. 

Hotel and private-house stock is ([uite different. 

Hotels use meat in such large (juantities, that there is alw.iys more 
or less trimminj^s and bones of moat to add to fresh meats ; that 
makes very strong stcjck, whi< h tliey usr in most all soups and ^r. ivies 
ami other made dishes. 

'I'he meat from whic h soup has Ixx-n made is ^ood to serve cold 
thus : take out all the boni-s, scascm with jiepper anil salt, and catsup, 
if liked, then i hoj) it small, tic it in a c loth, and lay it between two 
l)lates, with a weight on tlie upin-r one : slice it thin for lunc heon or 
supjicr ; or make sandu iches of it ; or make a hash for breakfast ; 
or make it into balls, with the addition of a little wheat tlour and an 
egg, and serve them fried in fat, or boil in the soup. 

An a .reeable flavour is sometimes im|)arted to s(nip by .sticking 
some cloves into the meal used tor making stock ; a few slices of 
onions fried very brown in liutter are nice; also flour browncnl by 
simply putting it intc a saucepan over the lire and stirring it ccju- 
stantly until it is a dark brown. 

Clear soups must be perfectly trans])arent, and thickened soujis 
about the consistence of cream. When soups and gravies are kept 
from day to day in hot weather, tlie\- shc)uicl be w.irmed up everv d.ty, 
and put into fresh-scalded pans or tuieeiis, and |)laced in a ( ool cellar. 
In temperate weather, every other day may be uftu ient. 

HERBS AND VEGETABLES USED IN SOUPS. 

Of vegetables the principal cjnes are carrots, tomatoes, asparagus, 
green peas, macaroni, green corn, beans, rice, vermicelli, Scotch 
barley, pearl barley, wheat tlour, mushroom or mushroom ' it-,up, 
parsnips, beet-root, turnips, leeks, garlic, shalcits and onions ; sliced 
onions fried with butter and tlour until they are browned, then rubbed 
through a sieve, are excelled to highten the colour and flavour of

tails, wash clean, and put in a kettle with nearly a gallon of cold 
water ; add a small handful of salt ; when the meat is well cooked,

pepper to your taste ; continue the boiling a while longer, and 
stir in, to season and thicken it a little, a tablespoonful of good butter

<|uarts of cold water, adding half a pound of lean ham (jr hacon cut 
into slices or pieces ; also a tea^poonful of salt and a little pepper, 
and some celery chopped fine. When the soup begins to boil, 
skim the froth from the surface. Cook slowly from three to 
four Injurs, stirring occasionally till the peas are all dissolved, 
ackiing a little more boiling water to ki-cij up the quantity as it 
boils away. Strain through a i(jlander, and leave out the meat. 
It should be quite thick. Ser\e with small scpiares of toasted 
bread, cut up and added. If not rii h rnou;.4h, add a sm.ill piece of 
butter. 

Cream of Asparagus. — F(jr making two (piarts of souj), 
u.-ie two bundles of fresh asparagus. Cut the tops from one of 
tlie bunches and cook them twenty minutes in salted water, enough 
to ( ()V(!r them. Cook the remainder of the a>paragus about twentv 
minutes in a cpiart of stock or water. Cut an onion into thin 
slices and fry in three tablespoonfuls of butter ten minutes, being 
careful not to scorch it : then add the asj)aragus that has been 
l)oiled in the stock ; cook this tive minutes, stirring constantly ; 
then adil three tablespoonfuls of dissolved tlour, cook Uw minutes 
longer. Turn this inixtiue into the boiling stock and boil twenty 
minutes. Rub througli a sieve ; add the milk and cream and 
the asparagus heads. If water is used in i)lace of stock, use all 
cream. 

Green Pea Soup.— Wash a small quarter of lamb in cokl 
water, and i)ul into a soup-pot with six quarts of cold water; 
adil to it two tal)lesi)oonfuls of salt, and set it over a moderate 
fire— let it boil gently for two hours, then skim it clear: add a 
quart of shelled peas, and a tcaspoonful of pepper ; cover it, and 
let it boil for half an hour ; then having scraped the skins from a 
quart of small young potatoes, add them to the soup ; cover the 
pot and let it boil for half an hour longer ; work (juarter of a 
pound of butter and a dessert spoonful of tlour together, and add 
them to the soup ten or twelve minutes before taking it off the 
fire. 

Serve the meat on a ilish with parsley sauce over, and the soup in 
a tureen. 

Dried Bean Soup. -Put two quarts of dried white beans to 
soak the night before you make the soup, which should be put on as 
early in the day as possible. 

Take two pounds of the lean of fresh beef — the coarse pieces will 
do. Cut them up, and put them into your soup-jjot with the bones 
belonging to them, ; wliirh should be Ijroken in pieces,) and a pound 
of lean bacon, cut very small. If you have the remains of a piece of 
beef that has been roasted the day before, and so much under-done 
that the juices remain in it, you may put it into the pot and its bones 
along with it. Season the meat with pepper only, and pour on it six

quarts of water. As soon as it boils, take oft the scum, and put in 
the lieans (having first drained them; and a head of celery cut small, 
or a tablespoonful of pounded celery seed. 15oil it slowly till the 
meat is done to shreds, and the beans all ilissolved. Then strain it 
through a colander into the tureen, and put into it small squares of 
toasted bread with the crust cut otT. 

Turtle Soup "from Beans. — Soak over night one ciuart of 
bL'K k beans ; next day boil them in the proper (juantity of water, 
say a gallon, then dij) the beans out of the pot and strain them 
through a colander. Then return the flour of the beans, thus 
pressed, into the pot in which liiey were boiled. Tie up in a thin 
cloth some thyme, a teaspoonful of summer savoury, and i)arsley, 
and let it boil in the mixture. Add a tal)lesi)oonful of C(jkl butter, 
salt and pepper. Have ready four hard-boiled yolks of eggs 
quartered, and a few forcemeat balls ; add this to the sou]) with 
a sliced lemon just before serving. 

This approaches so near in flavour t(j the real turtle soup that few 
arc able to distinguish the difference. 

y&rllngton Pepper Pot. — I'ut two pounds of tripe and 
four cahes' feet into tlie soup-pot and cover them with cold water ; 
add a red pepper, and boil closely until the calves' feet are Ixjiled 
very tender ; take out the meat, skim the licpiid, stir it, cut the 
tripe into small pieces, and put it back into the liquid ; if there 
is not enough liquid, add boiling water ; add half a teaspoonful of 
sweet marjoram, sweet ba>il, and thyme, two sliced onion-i, sliced 
potatoes, salt. When the vegetables have lx)ile<l until almost 
tender, add a piece of butter rolled in flour, drop in some

hot 

^t^ii.^rel Soup.— Wash and quarter three or four good sized 
squirrels ; put them on, with a small tablespoonful of salt, directly 
after breakfast, in a gallon of cold water. Cover the pot close, 
and set it on the back part of the stove to simmer gently, ftof 
boil. Add vegetables just the same as you do in case of other 
meat soups in the summer season, but especially good will you 
find corn, Irish potatoes, tomatoes and Lima beans. Strain the 
soup through a coarse colander when the meat has b(jiled to 
shreds, so as to get rid of the squirrel's troublesome little bones. 
Then return to the pot, and after boiling a while hunger, thicken 
with a piece of butter rubbed in flour. Celery and parsley leaves 
ch(jpped up are also considered an improvement by many. 
Toast two slices of bread, cut them into dice one half inch 
square, fry them in butter, put them into the bottom of your 
tureen, and then pour the soup boiling hot upon them. Very 
good.

tliin pie crust, dredge with flour to keep from sticking. Let it remain 
on the bread board to dry for an hour or more ; then roll it up into a 
tight scroll, like a sheet of music. Hegin at the end and slice it into 
slips as thin as straws. After all r.re cut, mix them lightly together, 
and to prevent them stiiking, keep them tltuired a little until you are 
ready to droj) them into your soup, which should be flone ' shortly 
before dinner, foi- if l)oiled A'c A'^v' they will go to pieces. 

Forcemeat Bails for Soup.— One cupful of cooked veal or

Fish Stock. -I'lace a saucepan over the fire with a g(jod sized 
piece of sweet butter, and a sliced onicm ; put into that some sliced 
tomatoes, then add as many dift'erent kinds of small fish as you can 
get— oysters, clams, smells, pr.iwns, crabs, shrimps, and all kinds .^f 
pan-fish ; cook all together, until the (jnions arc well browned, then 
add a bunch of sweet herbs, salt and pepper, and sufficient water to 
make the required amount of stock. After this has cooked for half

Havinj^ boiled one fine middle-sized lobster, extract all the meat 
from the body and claws. Uriiise part of the coral in a mortar, and 
also an equal (|uantity of the meat. .Mix them well together. Add 
mace, cayenne, salt and pepper, and make them up into fon emeal 
balls, bindinv,' the mixture with the yolk of an ej^^g slightly beaten. 

Take three cjuarts of the veal broth, and put into it the meat of the 
lobster cut into mouthfuls. Boil it toj^ether about twenty minutes. 
Then thicken it with the remaining coral (which you must first rub 
through a sieve), and add the forcemeat balls and a little butter 
rolled in tlour. Simmer it gently for ten minutes but do not let it come 
to a boil, as that will injure the colour. Serve with small dice of 
bread fried biown in butter. 

Oyster Soup. No. 1.— Two quarts of oysters, one <|uart of milk, 
two tal)le>p()onfuls of butter, one teacupful of hot wiiter ; pepper, 
salt. 

Strain all the liipior from the oysters ; add the water, and heat. 
When near the boil, add the seasoning, then the oysters. Cook 
about five minutes from the time they begin to simmer, until they 
"ruffle." Stir in the butler, cook (jue minute, and pour into the 
tureen. Stir in the boiling milk, and send to table. Some prefer 
all water in i)la( e of milk. 

Oyster Soup. No. 2. -Scald one g.illon of oysters in their own 
TKluor. Adil one ijuarl of ritli milk to the liipior, and when it comes

eggs, two good tablespoonfuls of butter, and one of tlour, all mixed 
well together, but in this order — first, the milk, then, after beating 
tiie eggs, add a little of the hot licpior to them gradually, and stir 
tliem rapidly into the souj). Lastly, add the butter and whatever 
seasoning you fancy besides plain j^ejiper and salt, which must both 
be put in to taste with caution. Celery salt most persons like 
extremely ; <ithers would prefer a little marjoram and thyme ; others 
again, mace and a bit of onion. Use your (nvn discretion in this 
regard. 

Clam Soup. (French Style.)— Mince two do/en hard-shell

CHAPTER \-III. 

FISH. 

To the '-hapter on I'isii we may prefix a few notes on FryinK in 
general. The usual custom amoiv^ profosional ( (x.ks is to entirely 
nnmersethe arti- le to be <:o(,ked in boilin;^ fat, but from inconvenience 
most households use the lialf-frying method of frying in a small 
amount of fat in a fryin^^-pan. For the (ir-.t method a shalh.w iron 
frying-kettle, lar^c at the top and small at the bottom, is best U) Use. 
The fat should half fill the kettle, or an ainouni sufficient to float 
whatever is to be fried; the heat of t lie fat should >^ct to such a decree 
that, when a piece of bread or a teaspoonful of the ba.ter is dropped 
Ml It, It will bet ome I)rown almost instantly, but should not be so hot 
as to burn the fat. Some cx.ks say that'the fat should he smoking 
but my exper/ence is, that is a mistak<s as that soon ruins the fat. 
As soon as it begins to smoke, it should l)e removed a little to one 
side, and still be kept at the l)oilin. p,,int. If fritters, crullers, 
croquettes, etc., are dropped into fat liiat is too hot, it crusts o\er the 
outside before the inside has fully risen, makin- a heavy hard 
article, and also ruining the fat, giving it a burnt flavour. 

Many FreiK h cooks |,refor beef fat or suet to lard for frying 
purposes, considerin;^ it more wholesome and digestible, docs not 
im|)art as much flavour, or adhere or soak into the artide cooked as 
pork fat. 

In families of any size, where there is much cooking required, there 
are enou;^h ilrii)pings and fat remnants from roasts of beef, skimmings 
from the soup-kettle, with the addition of occasionallv a i)ound of 
suet from the market, to .imply supply the need. All such remnants 
and skimmings should l)e cl.irified about twice a week, by boiling 
them all together in water. When the fat is all melted, it ^'liould be 
strained with tlie water and set aside to cool. After .he lat on the 
top has hardened, lift the cake from the water on which it lies, scrape 
olil all the dark particles from the bottom, then melt over again the 
fat ; while hot, strain into a small clean stone jar or bright \'\n pail, 
and then it is ready of use. Always after frvini; anythinj.;, the fat 
should stand until it settles and has cooled somewhat ; then turn off 
carefully so as to leave it clear from the sediment that settles at the 
bottom. 

Refined cotton-seed oil is now being adopted by most professional 
cooks in hotels, restaurants, and many private households for culinary 



purjxises, and will donbtloss \n future supers 



'r!e 



jats, cspecKiuy 



for frying, it being cpiite as delicate a medium as frving with olive oiL 
It is now sold by leading grocers, put up in packages of two and four 
quarts. 

The second mode of frying, using a frying-pan with a small quantity 



FISH 



59 



of fat or grease, to be done properly, should in tlic first place liave the 
fryiuK-p.'in hot over the fire, and the fat in it actually boiling before 
the article to be cooked is placed in it, the intense heat (juickly 
searing up the pores of t.ie article and forming a brown crust on 
the lower side, ihfn tiuninj^ over and browning the other the same 
way. 

Still, there is another mumIu of frying ; the |)r(Kt:s-, is somewhat 
similar to broiling, the hot frying pan or spider replai ing the hot fire. 
Todo this correctly, a thick bottom frying pan should lie used. I'l.ice 
it over the fire, and when it is so hot that it will siss, oil over the 
bottom of the pan with a piece of suet, that is if the meat is all lean ; 
if not, it is not necessary to grease the bottom of the pan. Lay in the 
meat (H'itc flat, and brown it (piickly, first on one side then on the 
other ; when sufTiciently cooked, dish on a hot platter and season the 
same as broiled meats. 

VARIOUS STYLES OF COOKING. 

In sclfding ti^h, choose thosi; only in wlii< h the eye is full and 
prominent, the tiesh thick and firm, the ^,calcs bright and fins stiff. 
They should be thoroughly cleaned before rooking. 

The usual modes of cooking fish are boiled, baked, broiled, fried 
and occasionally stewed. Steaming fish is much superior to boiling, 
but the ordinary cc^nveniences in private houses do not admit of the 
possibility of enjoying this delicate way of cooking it. Large fish are 
generally boiled, medium-sized ones baked or b(jiled, the smaller kinds 
fried or broiled. \'ery large fish, such as cod, halibut, etc., are cut in 
steaks or slices for frying or broiling. The heads ctf some fish, as the 
cod, halibut, etc., are consitlered tidbits by many. Small fish, or pan 
fish, as they are usually called, are served without the heads, with the 
exception of brook-uouts and smelts ; these are usually cooked whole, 
with ihe head on. H::ke fish slowly, basting often with butter and 
water. Salmon is considered the most nutritious of all fish. When 
boiling fish, by adding a little vinegar and salt t'> the water, it seasons 
and prevents the nutriment froi, being drawn out ; the vinegar acting 
on the water hardens the water. 

Fill the fish with a nicely i)rcpared stuffing of rolled cracker or stale 
bread crumbs, seasoned with butter, pepper, lalt, sage, and any other 
aromatic herbs fancied ; sew up ; wrap in a well-floured cloth, tied 
closely with twine, and boil or steam. The garnishes for boiled fish 
are : For turbol, fried smelts ; for other boiled fish, parsley, sliced 
beets, lemon or sliced boiled egg. Uo not u^e tlie knives, spoons, 
etc., that are used in cooking fish, for other food, or they will be apt 
to impart a fishy flavour. 

Fish to be Ixjiled should be put into cold water and set on the fire 
to cook very gently, or the outside will break before the inner part is 
done. Unless the fish are small, they should never be put into warm 
water ; nor should water, either hot or cold, be poured on to the fish, 
as it is liable to break the skin ; if should Ije necessary to add a 
little water while the fish is cooking, it ought to be poured in gently 
at the side of the vessel.

Fish to be broiled should iie, after they arc drc ,sed, for two or three 
hours with their inside well sprinkled with salt and i)epper.

To Fry Fi»h. — Mo^t of the smaller fish (^'enerally termed pah 
fish; are usu.illy fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if (luite 1 



, I'lrge, 

cut out the backbone, and sli( e the body crosswise into five or six 
pieces; season with s.dl and jjepper. Dip in Indian meal or wheat 
rtour, or in beaten c;<k, and roll in bread or tine cracker crumbs- 
trout and pcrc h should not be dipped in meal ; put into a thick bot- 
tomed iron fryinj;-pan. the tlesh side down, with he' ,ird or drippings ; 
fry slowly, turninK when liKhtly browned. The following method may 
be deemed preferable : Dredge the pie< es w ith flour ; brush tiiem over 
with beaten egg ; roll in bread ( rumbs, and fry in hot lard or drip- 
pings sufticient to cover, the saine as frying crullers. If the fat is very 
h(n, the fish will fry without absorbing it, and it will be [)al.aablv 
cooked. When browned on one side, turn it over in the fat and 
brown the ()ther, draining when done. This is a particularly good 



way to fry sli( es of large fish. Serve with Unmit 



si 



ices of lemon. 



o saut e ; garnish with 



Pan Fish. — I'lace ihem in a thick bottcjm fr

plate. Tut the lard Ixick into the pan, and when hot slip back the fish. 
When the other side is brown, drain, turn on a plate as before, and 
slip them on a warm platter, to be sent to the table. Leaving the 
heads on and the fish a crisj)y-brown, in perfect shape, improves the 
rppearance if not the flavour, (iarnish with slices of lemon. 

Baked Pike. — Carefully clean and wipe the fish, and lay in a 
dripj)mg-pan with enough hot water to prevent scorching. A per- 
forated sheet of tin, fitting loosely, or several muffin rings mav be used 
to kcej) It off the i)ottom. Lay it in a circle on its bellv, head and 
tail touching, and tied, or as directed in note on fish ; b;ike slowb.', 
basting often with butter and water. When done, have ready a cup 
of sweet cream or rich milk to which a kw spoons of hot water has 
been added ; stir in two large spoons of melted butter and a little 
chopped parsley ; heat all by setting the cup in boiling water ; add

the gravy from the dripping-pHn, and let it Iwil up once ; place the 
fish in a hot dish, and pour over it the sauce. >r an c^^ sauce may 
be made with drawn butter ; stir in the yolk <if an egg (|ui( kly, ami 
then a tcaspfxjn of chf>ppcd parsley. It can l)e stuffed or not, just as 
you please. 

Boiled Salmon.— The middle slice »)f salmon is the l)est. Sew 
up neatly in a net baj^, and boil a tpiartcr of an hour to the 
pound in hot salted water. When done, unwr.ip with care, and lay 
upon a hot dish, taking care not to break, it. H.ivc ready a large 
( upful of drawn butter, very rich, in whii h h.is been stirred a table- 
spoonful of minced parsley and the juice of a lemon, four half u|H)n 
the salmon, ;ind serve the rest in a boat, darni^h with j)arsley .md 
sliced eg^>. 

Broiled Salmon.— Cut slices from an inch to an inrh and a half 
thick, dry tli-ni in a (loth, season with salt and pa[)er, dredge them in 
sifted tlour, ;ind broil on .i gridiron rubbed with suet. 

Ant>t/u'r mode, — Cut the slices one inch thick, and season them with 
pepper and salt ; butter a sheet of white paper, lay each slice on a 
separate piece, en\elop(: them in it with their ends twisted ; broil 
gently over a clear fire, and serve with anclu)v y or ( iper sauce. 
When higher seasoning s rci.) jired, add a few choppeil herbs and a 
little si)i( r. 

Fresh Salmon f rii.d. t. . the slices three-quarters of an inch 
thirk, dredge them witi • .,r,r, or lip them in egg and crumbs, — fry a 
light brown. This mocle :• '.s for all fish cut into steaks. Season 
well with s.dt and pep|H.'r. 

Salmon and Caper Sauce.— '!'"'• -slices of sahn'm, one- 
ciuarter pound inittcr, one-half tcasp(X)nful of chopped parsley, one 
shalot ; salt and pepper to taste. 

Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, jjlace pieces of butter over it and 
add the other ingredients, rubbing a little of the seasoning into the 
fish ; ])Uice it in the oven and baste it bxH|uently ; when done, take it 
out and drain for a minute or two ; lay it in a dish, pour caper sauce 
over it, and serve. Salmon dressed in this way, with ttjmato sauce, is 
very delicious. 

Broiled Salt Salnran or Other Salt Fieh.— Soak salmon 
in tepid or cold water twenty-foui liours, ciianging water several times, 
or let stand under faucet of running water. If in a hurry or desiring 
a very salt relish, it may do to soak a short time, having water warm, 
and changing, parboiling slightly. At the hour wanted, broil sharply. 
Season to suit taste, covering with butter. This recipe will answer for 
all kinds of salt fish. 

PiClcled Salmon.— Take a fine, fresh salmon, and having cleaned 
it, cut it into large pieces, .int.! boil it in salted water a if for eating. 
Then drain it, wrap it in a dry cloth, and set it in a cold place till 
next d.^v. Tb.en m;Lke the oickle. which niust be in proportion to the 
quantity offish. T i one quart of the water in which the salmon was 
boiled, allow two quarts of the best vinegar, one ounce of whole black 
pepper, one nutmeg grated and a dozen blades of mace. Hoil all 
these together m a kettle closely covered to prevent the flavour from

evaporating. When the vinc;s^-lr tluis prepared is quite cold, pour it 
over the salmon, and put on the toj) a tablespoonful of sweet oil, which 
will make it keej) the ion-er. 

Cover It (lonely, jnit it in a dry, (oo! place, and it will be good for 
many months. This is the ni(e>t w.ty of preserving salmon, and is 
approxrd hy all who have tried it. 

Smoked Salmon. — Sn)okcd salmon to he hioiled should he put 
upon the -ridiron first, with the tiesh side; to the hie. 

Sm(»ked salmon is very ni( e when shaded like smoked beef, and 
served with coffee or tea. 

Fricassee Salmon. — 'ihis uay of cooking fresh salmon is a 
Jjleasant change from the ordinary modes of <-ookin,i; it : Cut one and 
one-half pounds of salmon into piec es one inch square ; put the pieces 
in a stewjjan with half a < upful of water, a little salt, a little white 
pepper, one clove, one blade of mac e, three i)ieces of su^ar. one shalot 
and a hea|)inK teaspoonful of mustard nuxed smocjthly with half a tea- 
cupful of vme^ar. Let this boil up once and add si.v tomatoes peeled 
and (ut into tiny pieces, and a few sprij^s of parselv finelv minced. 
Let all simmer j.;ently for three-(|uarters of an hour. ' Serve very hot, 
and i^arnish with dry toast < ut in triangular picies. 'I'hi^ ili>h is 
j^ood, very cold, for luncheon or breakfast. 

Salmon Patties.- Cut (old cooked salmon into dice. Heat 
about a jimt of the dice in half a jiint of cream. Season to taste with 
cayenne pepjjerand salt. Kill the shells and serve. Cold cooked tish 
of any kind may be made into patties in this way. L'se any fish 
sauce yoi! c lioosc— al! arc ec|ually yood. 

Fish and Oyster Pie.— Any remains of cold lish, sue h as cod 
or haddock, 2 do/.en o\^ters, pepper, and salt to taste, breail-crumbs 
sufitic lent for the .|uantity of tish: K teas|voonful of -rated nutmeg, I 
teaspoonful of finely c hopped parsk-,-. 

Clear the tish from the hemes, and put a laver of it in a pie-dish, 
which sprinkle with pepper and salt ; then a Javer of bread-crundjs^ 
oysters, nutmeg, and c hopped jjarsley. Repeat' this till the dish is 
(piite full, ^'ou may form a covering either of bread-crumbs, whic h 
should be browned, or puti'-paste, whic h should be cut off into long 
strips, and laid in t loss-bars over the fish, with a line of the i)aste first 
laid round the ed^e. Hefore putting on the top, pour in some made

To Broil a Shad. —Split antl u.-ish tlie shad, and afterwards dry 
it in a dotli. Sca>(Hi it witli salt and pepper. Have ready a l)ccl of

Baked Shad. — Many jK-opie arc of the opinion that the very best 
method of (ookinj^ a shad is to bake it. Stuff it with bread-( rumbs,

strain the gravy ; add to the latter a lablcspoonful of lemon juice, a tea- 
spoonful of brown flour and a pinch of cayenne, and serve with the fish. . 

Baked Salmon Trout. — This deliciously flavoured game-fish^ 
is baked precisely as shad or white fish, but should be accompaniedf 
with cream gravy to make it perfect. It should be baked slowly," 
basting often with l>utter and water. When ilone, have reafly ia a 
saui;epan a cup of cream, diluted with a few spoonfuls iA hut wiiler, 
for fear it might clot in heating, in whicli have been stirred cautiously 
two tablespoonfuls of nifdted butter, a S( ant tablespoonful of fluur, and

and remove carefully the sand-bag and gall ; also all the entrails ; 
they are unfit to eat, and are no longer used in cooking terrapins for 
the best tables. Cut the meat into pieces, and. put it into a stewoan 
with its eggs, and sufiicient fresh butter to stew it well. Let it stew 
till ipiite hot throughout, keeping the pan carefully covered, that none 
of the flavour may escape, but shake it over the fire while stewing. In 
another pan make a sauce of beaten yolk of egg, highly flavoured

'"luitani.s of a sal.ul 



Very lar^e lobsters arc not the best, the meat bein>,' coarse and 
[nunh. Tlur iiiah- is best for boilinj,' ; tho flesh is fiiim'r, and the shell 
a brii^hter icd ; it may icadiiy l)e distinguished from the female ; the 
tail IS narrower, and the two uppermost fins within the tail arc stiff 
and hard. Those <>( the lun lobster are not so, and the tail is 
broader. 

Hen lobsters are preferred for sauce or salad, on account of their 
coral. The head and smill claws are never used. 

They should be alive and freshly < au^ht when put into the boiling 
kettle. Aft<' beinj; (o ' 'cil, split open tlu body and tail, 

and (rack the ( lav. - c meat. The sand pou( h found 

near the throat sh^i >. ... -ed. Care should be exercised that 

none of the featlu r\-. -ouKh, k'11-'''<'" particles found under the body 
.shall KL't mixed \. tn the meat, as they are indigestible, and have 
caused mu< h trouble. 'I'hey are supposeti to be the cause of so-called 
poisoning from citing lobster. 

Serve on a platter. Lettuce, ami •'" 
should also be placed on the table <<i ,,i.iiIlt. 

Scalloped Lobster. -I '.utter a deep dish, and (over the 
bottom ..nil Imc luii.id > nirnljs : put on this a layer of chopped 
lobster - ,ih pepper and salt : so mi alternately until the dish is Hlleil, 
having ■ imbs on top. I'ut on bits of Initter, mtjisten with milk, and 
bake about twcntv minutes. 

Doviled Lobster.— Take out all the meal from a boiled lobster, 
res( ■ V iig theroial; reason highly with iiui>iard, < .lyenne, salt, and 
some kind of taljle saice ; stew until well mixed and put it in a covered 
saucepan, with just enough hot watei to keep from liurning ; rub the 
coral smooth, moistening \\ith vineg.ir until it is thin enough t(j i)our 
easily, then .-.tir it into the saut cpan. The dressing should be ])rtj- 
pared before iIk- meat i- ])Ut on the tir' , and whidi ought to boil liut 
once before the coral is i)ut in ; siir in .i he.iping tc,i-poonful '>f),,;,;er, 
and when it boils ag.iiii it is done, and should be taken up ,ii once, as 
too much ciioki ; toughens the meat. 

Lobster Croquettes. — Take any ^'f the lobster ojmaining 
from ial)le, .md pound it intil the dark, light meat ;ind < oral are well 
mixed ; put wiiii it not quite as much fine breatl-crumbs ; season with 
l)epper, salt, and .i \ery little cayenne pepper ; at, a little melted 
butler, about two table-.poonfu' . if the bread is rrttb.er dry ; form into 
egg-shaped or round lia!' ; roll them in egg, the n tine i runibs, and 
fry in lioiliivj l.ird. 

Lobster Pattic -Ciu some 1 ;lcd lob^ r in small pieces; 
then lake the small claws and the -pawn, put them in a suitable dish, 
and jam them to a paste with a potato masher. Now add to them a 
ladlctul of gra\\ "r bro»: , ^. ith a few bre .d-crumbs, ■■ t it over the fire 
anil boil ; strain it throigh a strainer, ur sieve, to ihe thickness of 
.1 • iiam, and put half of it to your lubsicrs, and rave the o;';wr half to 
^.uu e them with after they are baked. l''\i to the lobster the bigness 
of an egg of butlei, a little pepper and salt ; sque. -c in a lemon, and 
warm these over the fire enough el* e butter, set it to coo;, and 

sheet your patty-pan or a plate or ii good puflfpa^.c ; then put

in your lobster, and cover it with a paste ; bake it within tlnce quarters 
of an lioui Ixifore you want it ; when it is liakeil, cut up your cover, 
and warm up the other half of vour sauce above mentioned, with a 
httle butter, to the thickness of i mi. and pour it over your patties, 
with a little squeezed leniijn ; cu' Hit cover in two, an<l lay it on the 
top, two inches distant, so that -hat is under may be seen. You 
man b.ike crawfish, shrimps t.r prawns the same way ; and they are 
;ill proiHM for plates or little dishes for a second course. 

Lobster a la Newburg.— Take one whole lobster, < ut up in 
pieces about .1^ laiK^ a. .i hickory nut. I'ut in the same pan with a 
piece «.f ijutter size of .i walnut, season with salt and pepper to taste, 
and thicken with heavy cream saui ;■ ; add the yolk of one egg and 
some lemon juice. 

Cream Sauce for above is made as follows : i oz. butter, meltetl n 
sauce pan, 2 oz. tlour, mixed with butter; thin down to proper , 
sistcn. •■ with boilin^^ cream. 

Baked Crabs.— Mix the contents of a c,m of cral)s, bread- 
crumbs or pounded crackers. Pepper ;md salt the whole to taste ; 
miuce some cold ham ; have the b.ik.nKpan well buttered, place 
therein first a layer of the crab meat, prepared as above, then '^ j^^V^j^ 
of the minced ham, and so on, .ilternatiuK until the pan is filled. 
Cover the tup with bread-crumb^ and bits of butter, and b.ike. 

Deviled Crabs. -Half a dozen fresh crabs, boiled and minced, 
two ounces of butter, o- small te.ispoonfnl of mustard powder; 
< ivcnne pepper and salt . i.i>te. Put the meat into a bowl and mix 
cai'efullv with it an equal qu.intity of fine bread-crumbs. Work the 
butter to a liKhl cream, mix the mustard well with it, then stir in very 
carefullv, a handful at a time, the mixed crabs, a tablespoonful of 
( ream, and . rumbs. Season to taste with cayenne pepper and salt : 
fill the crab shells with the mixture, sprinkle bread (rumbs over the 
tops, put three small pieces of biiUer ujion the lop of each, and 
brown them quickh in a hot oven. They will puff in baking and 
' ill be found very nice. Half the quantity can be made. A crab- 
- 11 will hold the meat of two crabs. 

Crab Croquettes.— Pick the meat of boiled crabs and chop it 
fine. Season to taste with pepper, salt and melted butter. .Moisten 
we with rich milk or <:ream, then stiffen slightly with bread or 
< T-crumbs. Add two or three well-beaten eggs to bind the 

n. Form the crociuettes, egg and l)read-crumb them a;;d fry 

them (1.. itely in boiling lard. It is better to use a wire frying- 
basket for croiiuettes of all kinds. 

To make a Crab Pie. -Procure the crabs alive, and put 
them in boiling water, alon^ v^ith some salt. Hoil tl m for a 
quarter of ;ui hour or twenty minutes, according '■ ;'f size. When 
old, pi( k the meat tVoiu the claws and body, i j) al' " (ether, and 
mix it with crumbs of ^'reucU pepper and salt, and a 1" jtter. I ut 
all this into the shell, and bro^^n in a hot oven. A crab-shell wiU

sheet of paste for the lid ; put a clean towel into the dish (folded so as 
to sup|)ort the lid), set it into the oven and bake the paste well ; when

baking pre|)are the oysters. Having picked off carefully every bit of 
.^hell that may be found about them, drain off the licpiur into a pan 
and put the (jysters into a stew-pan with barely enough of the liijuor 
to keep them from Ijurning ; season them with pepper, salt and 
Initter ; add a little sweet (ream or milk, and one or two crackers 
rolled fine ; let the oysters simmer, but not boil, as that will shrivel 
them, liemove the upper crust of pastry and fill the dish with the 
(.ysters and gravy ; replac e the co\er and serve hot. 

Some prefer baking the upper crust on a pie-plate, the same size 
as the pie, then slipping it off on top of the pie after the same is 
filled with the oysters. 

Mock Oysters — Grate the corn, while green and tender, with

a puff i)aste, as for pics ; lay on it five or six select oysters, or 
en(;iiKh to (over the bottom ; butter them and season with a little 
salt and plenty of |)c])per ; spread over this an eyg batter, and rover 
with a crust of th(f paste, making' small openings in it with a fork. 
I5."kc in a hot oven liUci-n to twenty minutes, or until the top is 
ni<cly browncil. 

Stewed Clams. Wash < lean as many round i lams as 
recpiircd ; pile them m a large iron pot, with hrdf a cui)tul of hot 
water in the bottom, and put over the tire ; as soon as the shells 
o|)en, take out tlie (lams, cut off the hard, uneatal)le "fringe" from 
each, w'th strong, clean scissors, ])ut them into a stewpan with 
the broth from the jiot, and boil shjwly till they are t|uite tender; 
pepper well, and thicken the gra\y with llour, stirred into melted 
butter. 

Or, you may get two do/en freshly opened very small clams. Hcjil 
a pint of milk, a da>h of whue pepj)er and a small pat of butter. 
Now add the < lams. Let them come to a boil, and ser\e. Longer 
boiling will make the i lams almost indigestible. 

Roast Clams In the Shell. Koast in a pan over a hot fne, 

or in ;i hot o\en, or un hot stones ; when they o])en, empty the juice 
into ;i saucejian ; add the ( lams with butler, i)e|)p( r and a very little 
salt. 

Clam Fritters. Take fifty small or twenty-five large sand 
^ : if large, i ut each in two, lay them on a 
put a pint bowl of wheat tiour into a l)asin» 
add to u three well-l>eaten eggs, half a pint of sweet milk, and 
nearly as nuuh of their own licpior ; l)eat the batter until it is smooth 
and perfec tly free from hunjjs ; then stir in the clams. I'ut plenty of 
lard or beef f.it into ,i thii k-botiomed frying-pan, let it become 
boiling hot ; put in the batter by the ^ |)oonful ; let them fry gently; 
wlien one side is a delicate brown, turn the other. 

Clam Chowder. — The materials needed are fifty round clams 
{(juahogs , a l.iige liou! of salt pork, cut up fine, the same of onions, 
lineK' (hopped, and the s.ime or more, if you desire, of potatoes ( ut 
into eigths and sixteenths of original size ; wash the clams very 
thoroughly, and put them in a pot witli half a pint of water ; when 
the shells are open they are done ; then take them from the shells 
and chop iine. -.iv ing all the i aim water for the < howder ; fry out the 
pork very gentis. and when the siraps aie a good brown, take them 
out and put in the chojjped onions to fry ; tliey should be fried in a 
frying-p<in, and the < howder-keltle l)e made very i lean before they 
are put in it, or the chowder w ill burn, t/l'he chief secret in ciiowder- 
!V.:d;!n;.', is tis frv the onions so delicately that they will be missing in 
the chowiler.) 

Add a ijuart of hot water to the onions ; put in the clams, clam- 
w.iter anil pork scrajts. After it boils, add the p<jtatoes, and when 
lliey are CfM)ked, the chowder is tinislied. just before it is taken up,

^ooil black pepper. 

With tlie addition of six slit ed tomatoes, or half a can of the canned 
ones, this is the best recipe of this kind, .md is served in many of our 
lust restaurants. 

Scalloped Clams. — I'Uidiasc a do/en large soft clanvs in the 
slieil .md three tlo/en (jpened clams. Ask the dealer to open the tirst 
dozen, care being used not to injure the shells, which are to be used 
ill ( ooking the clams. Clean the shells well, and put two soft clams 
on ea( h half shell ; add lo each a d.ish of white pepper, and half a 
tcaspoonful of minced celery. Cut a slice of fat bacfin into the 
Muallest dice, add four of these to eaih shell, strew over the top a 
thin layer of tracker-dust : place a piece of table butter on top, and 
h.tke in the oven until brown. They are delightful when properly 
pii'pai(.-(i. 

Scallops. — If bought in the ^hell l>oil them and take out the 
hearts, whi< :h is the only part used. Dip them in beaten egg, and 
fry in the same manner as oysters. 

Si line prefer them stewed the same as oysters. 

Frogs Fried. — Frogs are u^<uall\- fried, and arc considered a 
great delicacy. Only the hind-legs ami quarters are used. Clean 
them well, season, and fry in egg batter, or dipi)ed in beaten egg and 
tine cracker-crumbs, the same as oysters. 

Fross Stewed. — Wash and skin the cpiartcrs, parboil them 
aliuut three minutes, drain them. Now, put into a stew-pan two 
oiini.es of butter. When it is melted, l.iy in the frogs, and fry about 
two minutes, stirring them to prevent l)urning ; shake over them a

POULTRY AND GAIVIE 

I,\ ( hoosing iK>ultry, sele( t tiiose that are fresh and fat, and the 
surest way tt^ determine whether they are young, is to try the skin 
under the leg or wing. If it is easily broken, it is young ; or, turn 
the wing bat kwards, if the joint yields readily, it is tender. When 
poultry is young the skin is thin and tender, the legs suKKjth, the 
feet moist and limber, and the eyes full and bright. The botly should 
iir thi( k and the breast fat. (Ji'il turkeys lia\e long h.iirs, and the 
fl'->li i-> purplish where it shou^ umU'r the skin on the legs and back. 
.Mjout March they lieteriorate in ipiality. 

Vuung ducks and geese arc plump, with light, semi-transparent fat, 
soft breast-bone, tender fesh, leg-joint-- -Ahich will break by the 
w( i;lit of the bird, fresh-coloured and brittle be.iks, and wind-pipes

that break when pressed between the thumb and the fc^refin^'cr. 
They are Iw^t in auliinin and winter. 

^'(HlnK pigeons have h^ht red ilesh upon the breast, and full, 
fresh-cf)loured le^'s ; wiien the Ie},'s are thin and the breast very dark 
the birds arc old. 

Fine ganu; birds arc always heavy for their size ; the flesh of the 
breast is firm and plump, and the skin riear ; and if a few feathers 
be pluf kcd fr(Mn the inside of the Ic^ and around the vent, the flesh 
of freshly-killed birds will be fat and frcsh-coloiircd ; if it is dark and 
discoloured, the i,'anie has been hunj,' a lon^ time. The wind's of 
Kood (Ui( ks, j^cesc, pheasants, and woodco( k are tender to the touch ; 
the tijjs of the lon>,f win^' feathers of partrid^'cs are jjointed in young 
birds and round in old ones. ()uail, snipe and small birds should 
have full, tender breasts. Poultry should never be cooked until si.\ 
or ei^ht hours affr it has been killed, but it should be pi( ked and 
drawn as soon as possible. Plunge it in a pot of scalding hot water ; 
then plurk off the feathers, taking care not to tear the skin ; when it 
is jiicked clean, roll uj) a piece of white i)aper, set tire to it, and singe 
off all the hairs. The head, neck and feet should be cut off, and the 
ends of the legs skewered to the body, and a string tied tightly 
around the body. When roasting a chicken or small fowl there is 
danger of the legs browning or becoming too hard to be eaten. To 
avoid this, take strips of cloth, dip them into a little melted lard, or 
even just rub them over with lard, and wind them arounil the legs. 
Remo\e them in time to allow the legs to brown delicately. 

Fowls, and also various kinds of game, when bought at our city 
markets, require a more thorough cleansing than those sold in 
country places, where as a general thing the meat is wholly dressed. 
In large cities they lie for some length of time with the intestines 
undrawn, until the flavour of them diffuses itself all through the meat, 
rendering it distasteful. In this case, it is safe after taking out the 
intestines, to rinse out in several waters, and in next to the last water, 
add a teaspoonfu! of baking soda ; say to a cpiart of water. This 
jirocess neutralizes all sourness, and helps to destroy all unpleasant 
taste in the meat. 

Poultry may be baked so that its wings and legs arc soft and 
tender, by being i)lacetl in a deep roasting pan with close cover, 
thereby retaining the aroma and essences by absorption while con- 
fined. These pans are a recent innovation, and are made double 
wirh a small opening in the top for giving vent to accumulation of 
steam and gases when reipiired. Ro.isi meats of .my kind can also 
be cooked in the same manner, and it is a great imprt)vement on the 
olil plan. 

Roast Turkey. — .Select a young turkey ; ren^ovo all the feathers 
(arcfuily, singe it over a burning newspaper uu the tup of the stove ; 
then "draw" it nicely, being very caieful not to bre.ik any of the 
internal organs ; remove the crop carefully ; ( ut otVthe head, and tie 



neck close to the hiuiy Ny ilrawing the skin o\ii it. .Now rinse the 
inside of the turkey out with several w.ilers, and in the next

of a fowl is very sour, especially if it is not freshly killed. Smla, 
hcinj,^ cleansing, acts as a corrective, and destroys that unpleasant 
taste .vhich \\c fretiuently experience in the dressing when fowls have 
been killed for some time. Now, after washing, wipe the turkey dry, 
inside and out, with a clean cloth, rub the inside with some salt, then 
stuff the lireast and body with "Dressing for Kowls." Then io.v up 
the turkey with a strong thread, tie the legs and wings to the lx)dy, 
rub it over with a little soft butter, sprinkle over some salt and pepper, 
diedj^e with a little tlour ; place it in a dripping pan. ()our m a cup 
of boiling water, and set it in the oven. Haste the turkey often, 
turning it around occasion.illy so that every part will be uniformly 
b.iked. When pierced with a fork and the liquid runs out perfectly 
dear, the bird is done. If any part is likely to scorch, pin over it a 
l)ie(e of buttered white paper. A tifteen-pound turkey recpiires 
between three and four hours to bake. .Serve with cranberry 
sauce. 

draiy for T'wrXvj.— When you put the turkey in to roast, put the 
n(< k, heart, liver and gizzard into a stewpan wuh a [jint of water ; 
boil until they become quite tender ; take them out of the water, chop 
the heart and gizzard, mash the li\cr and throw away the ne<:k ; 
return the chojjped heart, gizzard and liver to the liquor m which 
they were stewed ; set it to one side, and when the turkey is done it 
■should be .idded tcj the gravy that dripped from the turkey, having 
tirst skimmed off the fat from the surface of the dripping-pan ; set it 
all (<\cr the lire, boil three minutes and thicken with tlour. It will 
not need brown tlour to colour the gravy. The garnishes for turkey 
or chicken are fried oysters, thin slices of ham, slices of lemon, fried 
sausages, or fori e-meat balls, aNo ])arsiey. 

Dressing or Stuffing for Fowls, -lor an 'ight or ten 
pound turkey, cut the brown crust from slices or pieces of stale bread 
until you have as much as the inside of a pound loaf; put it into a 
suitable dish, and pour tepid water (not warm, for that makes it 
heavy) over it ; let it stand one minute, as it soaks very ([uickly. 
Now take up a handful at a time and s(|ueeze i; hard and dry with 
both hands, placing it, as you go along, in another dish ; this process 
i> very light. When all is pressed dry, to>s it all up lightly through 
your fingers ; ntjw add pepper, salt,— about a ieaspm>nful--also a 
teaspoonful of powdered sununer savoury, the same amount of sage, 
or the green herb minced fine ; add half a cup of melted butter, and 
a beaten egg, or not. Work thoroughly altogether, and it is ready

Chicken Pattle8.-Mince up fine cold chicken, either roasted or 
Ix.i ed. Season it with pepper and salt, and a little minced parsley 
and onion. Moisten it with chicken ^ravy or cream sauce," fill 
scall.jpei shells that are lined with pastry with the mixture, and

butter over each, and bake brown in a h(3t oven. 

To Broil Chicken.-., <:r dressiny and washing the chickens 
as previously directed, split them open through the back-bone • froL' 
them by cutting the cords under the win^s and layiuK the wings out 
flat ; cut the sinews under the second joint of the leg and turn the 
leg down ; press down the breast-bone wilhcnit breaking it 

.Season the chicken with salt and pepper, K.y it upon the gridiron 
with the inside first to the fire ; put the griiliron over a slow fire and 
I)Iacc a tin sheet and weight upon the chicken, to keep it flat ; let it 
broil ten minutes, then turn and proceed in the same manne'r with 
the other side. 

The chicken should be perfectly cooked, but not scorched A 
broiled chicken brought to the table with its wings and legs burnt 
and its breast half cooked, is very disagreeable. To avoid this, the 
< hii ken must be closely watched while broiling, and the fire must be 
arranged so that the heat shall bo equally di;,pensed. When the fire 
I. too hot under any (;ne part of the chicken, i)ut a little ashes on the 
tire under that part, that the heat may be reduced. 

Dish a broiled chicken on a hot plate, |)utting a large lump of 
butter andatablespoonfulofhot water upon the plate, and turning the 
chicken two or three times that it may absorb as much of the butter 
a^ possible. Garnish with parsley. Serve with poached eggs on a

Broiled Chicken on Toast — I'.roil the usual wav, and when 
ihorouKlily ihmc take it up in a hcjuare tin or drippiny-pan, butter it 
well, season with pepper and sah, and set it in the oven for a few 
minutes. Lay slices of moistened buttered toast on a platter ; take 
the chicken u|) over it, add t(j the gra\ y in the pan part of a cupful of 
cream, if you have it ; if not, use milk. Thicken with a little flour 
and pour over the chicken. 

'i'his is considered inosl excellent. 

Curry Chicken.— Cut up a chicken weighing' from a pound and 
a half to two pountis, as for fricassee, wash it well, and put it into a 
stcwpan with sufficient water to cover it ; boil it closely covered, until 
tender ; add a large teaspcKjnful of salt, and cook "a few m'inutes 
longer; then remove from the tire, take out the chicken, pcjur the 
liquor mto a bcnvl. and set it on one side. Now cut up into the stew- 
pan two small onions, and fry them with a piece of butter as large as 
an egg ; as soon as the (jnions are brown, skim them out ai.d put in 
the chicken ; fry for three or four minutes ; ne.\t sprinkle over two 
teaspoonfuls of Curry Powder. Now pour over thf^ litjuor in which 
the chicken was stewed, stir all well together, and stew for five 
mmutes longer, then stir into this a tables!)oonful of sifted flcnir made 
thm with a little water ; lastly, stir in a beaten yolk of ei;g, and it is 
done. 

Serve with hot boil(;d rice laid round on the edge of a platter, and 
the chicken curry in the centre. 

This makes a handsome side dish, and a r,ne relish accompanying 
a full dinner of roast beef or any roast. 

All first-class grocers and druggists keep this "Indian Curry 
Towder," put up in bottles. liecf, veal, mutton, duck, pigeons 
partridges, rabbits or fresh fish may be substituted for the chicken if 
preferred, and sent to the table with or without a dish of rice. ' 

To Boil Riic for Curry.— V\cV over the rice, a cupful. Wash it 
thoroughly in two or three cold waters ; then leave it about twenty 
minutes in cold water. Put int(j a stcwpan two quarts of water with 
a teaspoonful of salt in it, and when it boils, sprinkle in the rice. IJoil 
It briskly for twenty minutes, keeping the pan covered. T.ike it from 
the fire, and drain off the water. Afterwards set the saucepan on the 
back of the stove, with the lid off', to allow the rice to dry and the 
grains to separate. 

Rice, if i)roperly l)oiled, should be soft and white, and every grain 
stand alone. Serve it hot in a separate dish or served as above, laid 
around the chicken curry.

Chicken Pot-Pie. No. 2.— This style of pot-pie was made 
more in our grandmother's day than now, as most cooks consider that 
cooking crust so Ion- destroys its spongy Hghtness, and renders it too 
hard and dry. 

Take a i)air of fine fowls ; cut them up, wash the pieces, and 
season with pepper only. Make a hght biscuit dough, and plenty of 
It, as It is always much liked by the eaters of pot-pie. Roll out the 
dough not very thin, and cut most of it into long squares. Butter the 
sides of a pot, and line them with dough nearly to the top Lay 
slices of cold ham at the bottom of the pot, and then the pieces of fowl 
interspersed all through with squares of dough and potatoes, pared 
and quartered. I'our in a quart of water. Cover the hole with a lid 
of dough, having a slit in the centre, through which the gravy will 
bubble up. Boil It steadily for two hours. fLalf an hour befo'-e you 
take It up, put m through the hole in the centre of the crust some bits 
of butter rolled in flour, to thicken the gravy. When done put the 
pie on a large dish, and pour the gravy over it. 

Vou may inters|)erse it all through with cold ham. 

A pot-i^ie may be made of ducks, rabbits, squirrels, or vension. 
Also of beef-steak. A beefsteak, or some pork-steaks (the lean only ) 
greatly improve a chicken pot-pie. If you use no ham, season with 
salt. 

Chicken Stewed, with Biscuit.-Take chickens, and make 
a fricassee ; just before you are ready to dish il up, have ready two 
iKikmg-tins of rich soda or bakii g-powder biscuits; take them 'from 
the oven hot, split them apart by breaking them with your hands, lay 
them on a large meat platter, covering it, then pour the hot rhicken 
stew over all. Send to the table hot. This is a much better way 
than boiling this kind of biscuit in the stew, as you are more sure of 
Its Ijcing alway light. 

Chicken Dressed as Terrapin.— Select young chickens, 
clean and cut them into pieces ; put them into a stewpan with just 
enough water to cook them. When tender stir into it half of a cup 
of butter and one beaten ci^-g. Season it with salt and pepper, a tea- 
si)oonfu! of powdered thyme ; add two hard-boiled eggs coarsely 
minced. Boil up once and serve with jelly. 

Chicken Roly-Pofy.— One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls of 
cream tartar mixed with the flour, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved 
in a tea.upful of milk ; a teaspoonful of salt ; do mn use shortening 
of any kind, but roll out the mixture half an inch thick, and on it lay 
minced chicken, veal or mutton. The meat' must be seasoned with 
pepper and salt ; and be free from gristle. Roll the crust over and 
over, and put it on a buttered plate and place in a steamer for half an 
hour. Serve for breakfast or lunch, giving a slice to each person with 
gravy served with it.

minced meat <m one-half of the round ; fold tht; other half over, and 
pinch the edges well together, then fry them in hot drippings or fat, 
a nice brown. Tiicy may also be cooked in a moderate oven. 

Chicken Pudding.— Cut up two young chickens into good- 
sized pieces ; put them in a saucepan v.ith just enough water to cover 
them well. When boiled cpiite tender, season with salt and pei)pcr ; 
let them simmer ten or fifteen minutes longer ; then take the chicken 
from the broth and remove all the large bones. Place the meat in 
a well-buttered pudding-dish, season again, if necessary, adding a feu- 
bits of butter. Pour over this the following batter : 

Eight eggs beaten light and mi.xed with one ([uart of milk, three 
tablespocmfuls of melted butter, a tcaspoonful of salt, and two large 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, added to enough sifted Hour to make 
a batter like griddle-cakes. 

Pake one hour in a moilerate oven. 

Make a gravy of the broth that remained from the cooking of the 
chicken, adding a tablespoonfid of (lour, stirred into a third of a cup 
of melted butter ; let it boil up, putting in more water, if necessary. 
Serve hot in a gravv boat, with the pudding. 

Chicken and Maccaroni.— Hoil a chicken until very tender, 
take out all the bones, and pick up the meat quite fine. P.oil half a 
pound of maccaroni until tender, first breaking it up to pieces an inch 
long. lUitter a decj) pudtling-dish, put on the bottom a layer of the 
cooked maccaroni, then a layer of the minced ckicken, bits of butter 
pepper and salt, then some of the chicken liciuor, over this put 
another layer of maccaroni, and so on, until the dish is filled. i>our a 
cup of cream over the whole, and bake half an hour. Serve on a 
platter. 

Roast Duck. (Tame.)— Pick, draw, clean thoroughly, and 
wipe dry. Cut the nev k close to the back, beat the breast bone fiat 
with a rolling pin, tie the wings and legs securely, and stuff with the 
following : 

Three pints bread-crumbs, si.\ ounces butter, or part butter and 
salt pork, two chopped onions and one teaspoonful each of sage, 
black pepper and salt. Do not stuff very full, and sew up the op^--' 
ings firmly to kcrp the flavour in and the fat out. If not fat eno 
it should be larded with salt pork, or tie a slice uptm the bi. , 
Place in a baking-])an, with a little water, and baste frecpiently with 
salt and water — some add onion, and some vinegar ; turn often, so 
that the sides and back may all be nicely browned. When nearly 
done, l)asle with butter and a little flour. These directions will apply 
to lame g.-ese as well as ducks. Young ducks should roast from 
twenty-five to thirty nunutes, and full-grown ones for an hour or 
more, with frecjuent basting. Some prefer them underdone and 
scr\cd \ery hot; but, as a rule, thorough cooking will prove more 
palatable. Mrke a gravy out of the neck and gizzards by putting

Braiixeci Ducks.— Prepare a pair of fine younj; ducks, the same 
as for roasting, place them in a stewpan together with two or three 
slices of bacon, a carrot, an onion stuck with two cloves, and a httle 
thyme and parsley. Season with pepper, and cover the whole with a 
broth, adding to brotn any seasoning preferred. Place the [Kin over a 
gentle fire and allow the ducks to bimmer until done, basting them 
frequently. When done remove them from the pan, and place them 
where they will keep hot. A turnip should then be cut up and fr'ed 
in some butter. When nicely browned, drain the pieces and cook 
them until tcntler in the liquor in which the ducks were braised. 
Now strain and thicken the gravy, and after dishing up the ducks, 
pour it over them, garnishing with the pieces of turnip. 

Stewed Duck. — Prepare them by cutting them up the same as 
chi( ken for fricassee. Lay two or three very thin slices of salt pork 
upon the bottom of a stewpan ; lay the pieces of duck upon the pork. 
Let them slew slowly fcjr an hour, closel\ 'overed. Then season with 
salt and pepper, half a teaspoonful of {x.wilered sage, or some green 
sage mixed fine ; one chopped onion. Slew another half hour until 
the duck is tender. Stir up a large tablesptjonful of brown flour in a 
little, water and add it to the stew. Let it boil up, and serve all 
together in one dish, accompanied with green peas. 

Duck Pie.— Cut all the meat from cold roast ducks ; put the 
bones and stuffing into cold water ; cover them and let boil ; put the 
meat into a deep dish ; pour on enough of the stock made from the 
bones to moisten ; cover with pastry slit in the centre v.ith a knife, 
and bake a light bnisn. 

Warmed up Duck.— A nice dish Un- breakfast, and very relishing, 
can be made from the remains of a roast of duck. Cut the meat from 
the bones, pick out all the little tidbits inthe recesses, lay them in a 
fr\ing-pan, and cover with water and the cold gravy left from the 
roast ; add a piece of butter ; let a'i boil up once and if not ciuite 
thick enough, stir in a little dissolved flour. Serve hot. 

Roast Wild Duck — Wild duck should not be dressed too soon 
after being killed. If the weather is cold it will be better for being 
kept several days. Bake in a hot oven, letting it remain for five or 
ten minutes without basting to keep in the gravy, then baste frequently 
with butter and water. If o%'er-done it loses flavour, thirty to forty 
mmutes in the right kind of an oven being sufficient. Serve on a very 
hot dish, and send to table as hot as possible with a cut lemon and 
the following sauce : 

Put in a tiny saucepan a tablespoonful each of Worcestershire 
sauce and mushroom catsup, a little salt and cayenne pepper, and the 
juice of half a lemon. Mix well, make it hot, remove from the fire, 
and stir in a teaspoonful of made mustard. Pour into a hot gravy

Squirrel. -They are cooked similar to rabbits, are excellent when 
broiled or made into a stew, and, in fact, .are verv good in all the 
diherent st\lcs of cookiiii; similar to r.abbit. 

Roast Hare or Rabbit.— A verv close relationship exists 
between the iiare and the ral)bit, the chief difference beinj,' in the 
smaller size .and shorter k-s and ears of the latter. The manner of 
dressing and prei)arin- each for the table is, therefore, pretty nearly 
the same. To pic|)are them for nKistin-, first skin, wash well in cold 
water and rinse thoK^iKldy in lukewarm w.iter. If a little musty from 
beinK emptied before they were lumj,^ up, and afterward neglected, 
rub the insules with vincKar antl aftenvard remove all taint of the 
acid by a thorough washing in lukewarm water. After being well 
wipcul with a soft cloth put in a dressing as usual, sew the animal up, 
truss It, and roast for a half or three-i|uarters of an hour, until weH 
browned, basting it constantly with butter and dredging with Hour, just 
l)efore taking up. 

To make a gravy, after the r.ibbits are roasted, pour nearly all the 
fat out of the ])an, but do not jjour the bottom or brown part of the 
drippings ; put the pan over the fire, stir into it a heaping tablespoon- 
ful of (lour, ,-md stir until the flour browns. Then stir in a pint of 
boiling water. .Season the gravy with salt and f^epper ; let it boil for 
a moment. Send hot to the table in a tureen with the hot rabbits. 
Serve with currant jelly.

remove the saucepan from the fire, squeeze in the juice of u lemon, 
stirring all the while, and pour over the rabbits. Do not cook the 
head or neck.

and washed, put it into boiling water, and lot it boil ten minutes ; 
dram it, and when cold, cut it into joints, dip into beaten ckk', and 
tlien in fine bread-crumbs ; season with sah and pepjxr. When all 
arc ready fry them in butter and sweet lard, mixed over a moderate 
fire until brown on both sides. Take them out, thicken the gravy 
with a spoonful of flour, turn in a cup of milk or (team ; let all boil 
up, and turn over the raiibits. Servi- lun with onion sauce, (Sec

Rabbit Pie. This pie can be made the same as "Came I'ie " 
excepting y.-u scatter throuKh it four hard-lxjiled e^ys cut in 
slices. Cover with puff paste, cut a slit in the middle, and bake one 
hour, layini^ paper ovit the top should it brown too fast 

Broiled Rabbits.-After skinniuK and cleaning the rabbits, 
wipe tiuin diy, split them down the back lengthwise, pound them flat, 
then wrap them in letter paper well buttered, place them on a buttered 
gridircin, and broil over a clear, brisk fire, turning them often. 
Wlun sufficiently c(wked, remove the papers, lay them on a very 
hot platter, season with salt, pepper, and plenty of butter, turning 
tiiem over and over to soak up the butter. Cover and keep hot in a 
warming o\cn until served. 

Salmi of Game — This is a nice mode of serving the remains of 
roasted game, but when a sui)erlativc salmi is desired, the birds 
must be scarcely more than half njasted for it. In wither case, carve 
them very neath-, and strip every particle of skin and fat from the legs 
wings and breasts ; bruise the bodies well, and put them with the 
skin and other trimmings into a very clean stew-pan. If for a simple 
and inexpensive dinner, merely add to them two sliced oni(<ns, a bay 
leaf, a small blade of mace and a few peppercorns; then pour in a 
pint or more of good veal gravy, or strong broth, and boil it briskly 
until reduced nearly half; strain the gravv, pressing the bones well 
to obtain all the flavour ; skim off the fat, add a little cavenne and 
lemon juxe, heat the ^ame very graduallv in it, but do not on any 
account allow it to boil ; place pieces of fried bread round a dish, 
arranj^e the birds in good form in the centre, give the sauce a boil. 
and pour it on them. 

Roast Haunch of Venison.-To prepare a haunch of 
venison for roasting, wash it slightly in tepid water, and drv it 
thoroughly by rubbing it with a clean, soft cloth. Lay over the' fat 
side a large sheet of thickly buttered paper, and next a paste of flour 
and water about three-quarters of an inch thick ; cover this again 
with two or three sheets of stout i)aper, secure the whole well with 
twine and put down to roast, with a little water, in the drijnMng-pan. 
Let the fire be clear and strong ; baste the paper immediately with 
butter or clarified drippings, and roast the joint from three to four 
hours, according to i- ^ weight and quality. Doe venison will require 
Half an hour less time than buck veni'^on Abo"^ '"fn'v mi"— "- 
before the joint is done remove the paste and paper, baste the meat 
in every part with butter, and dredge it very lightly with flour; let it 
take a pale brown colour, and serve hot with unflavoured gravy made 
with a thickening, in a tureen and good currant jelly. Venison is

nnirh better wlicn the deer has licen killed in the autumn, when wild 
berries are plentiful, and it has had abundant opjxjrtunities to fatten 
upon this and other frc^h food. 

Broiled Vonison Steak — Venison steaks should l)e broiled 
over a rlear fire tiirninK often. It recpiires more cooking than i)eef. 
When suftlf lentiy done, season with salt and pepper, pour over two 
taijiespoonfuls of currant jelly, melted with a piece of butter. Serve 
hot on hot j)Iates. 

Delirious steaks, correspond in},' to the shape of mutton chops, are 
cut from the loin. 

Baked Saddle of Venison.— Wash the saddle carefully ; 
sec that no hairs are left dried on to the outside. Use a saddle of 
venison of about ten pounds. Cut some salt pork in strips about two 
inches lon^, and an eighth (jf an inch thick, with which lard tlie saddle 
with two r(nvs on each side. In a lat^e dripping-pan cut two carrots, 
one onion, and some salt pork in thin slices ; add two bay leaves, 
two cloves, four kernels of allspice, half a lemon, sliced, and season 
with salt md pepper; jilace the saddle of venison in the pan, with a 
quart of >^iiod stock, boiling hot, and a small piece of butter, and let 
It boil about fifteen minutes on top of the stove ; then put it in a hot 
oven and bake, basting nell every five minutes, until it is medium 
rare, so that tlie bl<jod runs when cut ; serve with jelly. If the venison 
IS desired well done, cook much longer, and use a cream sauce with 
It, or stir cream into the venison gravy. (For cream sauce see 
Sauces.) 

Venison should never be roasted unless very fat. The shoulder is a 
roasting piet e, and may l)e done without the pajjer or paste. 

In on' .-ring the saddle recpiest the but( her to cut the ribs off i)retty 
close, as the only part that is of much account is the temlerloin and 
thick meal that lies along the bockbone up to the neck. The ribs 
which extend from this have very little meat on them, but are always 
sokl with the saddle. When neatly cut off they leave the saddle in a 
better shai^e, and the ribs can be i)ut into your stock pot to boil for 
soup. 

Venison Pie or Pastry — The neck, Ijieast, and shoulder are 
the parts used for a venison pie or pastry. Cut the meat into pieces 
(tat and lean together) and put the bones and trimmings into the 
stew-pan with pepper and salt, and water or veal broth enough to cover 
It. Simmer it till you have drawn out a good gravv. Then strain 
It. 

^ In the meantime make a good rich paste, anil roll it rather thick. 
Cover ihe bottom and sides of a deep di^h with one sheet of it, and 
put in your meat, having seasoned it with pepper, salt, nutmeg and 
mace. I'our in the gravy which you have pie[)ared from the trim- 
mings. Lay on the top some liits of butter rolled in tlour. Cover the 
pie with a thick lid of paste and ornament it handsomely with leaves 
and Hnwers formed with a tin culler. Bake two or more hours ac- 
cording to the size. Just before it is done, pull it forward in the oven, 
and brush it over with beaten c^ni ; push it back and let it slightly

CHAPTER XT. 

BEEF. 

In the selection of meat it is most essential that we understand how 
to choose It ; in beef it should be a smooth, fine grain, of a clear 
bright red colour, the fat white, and will feel tender when pinced with 
the hngers. W ill also have abundant kidney fat or suet. The most 
choice pieces for roast arc the sirloin, fore and middle ribs. 

Veal, to be good, should have the tlesh firm and dry, fine grained 
and of a delicate pinkish colour, and plenty of kidney fat ; the joints 

Mutton is good when the flesh is a bright red, firm and juicv and 
a close gram, the fat firm and white. 

I'ork: if young, the le>n will break on being pinched smooth when 
nipped with the hngers, also the skin will break and dent ; if the rind 
IS rough and hard it is old. 

In roasting meat, allow from fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound 
which will vary according to the thickness of the roast. A great deal 
of the success in roasting depends on the heat and goodness of the 
fire ; if put into a cool oven it loses its juices, and the result is a touuh 
tasteless roast; whereas, if the oven •. of the proper heat it 
immediately sears up the pores of the r. c l and the juices are're- 

The oven should be the hottest when the meat is put into it in 
order to quickly crisp the surface and close the pores of the meat 
thereby connmng its natural juices. If the oven is too hot to hold 
the hand in for only a moment, then the oven is right to receive the 
meat. The roast should first be washed in pure water, then wined 
dry wtth a clean dry cloth, placed in a baking-pan, without any

KEEK 




seasoning ; some picrcs of suet or cold drippings l;iiil under it, but 
no wiitcr should be jjut into the pan, for this would have a tendency 
to soften tlic outside of the nicit. The water (an never },'et so hot as 
the hot fat upon the ^.urfa< c of tlie meat, and the K^ncratinK of the 
steam prevents its crispness, so de-siral)le in a roast. 

It should be fre<|uently basted with its own drijipin--, whi( h flow 
from the meat ulien partly cooked and well seasoned. Lamb, vea! 
and |tork should be ( ooked rather slower than beef, with .i mrjre 
m<jderate fiif, i overin;^ the fat with a piei f of p.iprr, and thorouKhly 
<(>ok<-d till the th'sh parts from tiiebone ; ami nu ely browned williout 
being burned. An onion sliced and |)Ut on top of a roast while cook- 
ing, cspeci.illy roast of pork, gives a ni( e flavour. Remove the onion 
befoie serving. 

Larding meats is drawing riblxjns of fat pork through the upper 
surface of the meat, leaving both end jjrotruding. Tliis is accom- 
plished by the use of a larding-needle, whii.h may be procured at 
iiousc-furnishing stores. 

lioiling or stewing meat, if fresh, should be put into bcjiling water, 
closely covered, and boilcil slowly, allowing tweiuy nunutes to each 
pound, and when partly cooked, or when it begins to get tender, 
salted, adding spices and vegetables. 

Salt meats should be covered witli cold water, and recpiire thirty 
minutes very slow boiling, frcmi tlie time the water boils, for each 
pound ; if it is very salt, pour off the first water, andjiut it in .inother 
of boiling water, or it may be soaked one night in cold w.iter. .After 
meat commences to boil, the pot shoulil never st(jp simmering and 
always l)e rei)lenished from the boiling teakettle. 

Frying may be done in two ways : one method, wliic h is most 
generally ustnl, is by putting one ounce or more (as the case requires) 
of beef drip|)ings, lard or butter, into a frying-pan, and when at the 
boiling point. Laying in the meat, cooking down both sides a nice 
brown. The other method is to completely inunerse the article to be 
cooked in suftlcient hot l.ird to cover it, simil.ir to frying doughnuts. 

Broiled meats should be placed over clear, red c(jals, free from 
smoke, giving out a good he.it, but not too brisk or the meat will be 
hardened and scorched ; but if the fire is dead, the gravy will escape, 
and dro]) ujion the coals, creating a bl:i/e, which will olacken ancl 
smoke the meat. Steaks and cho[)s should be turned often, in order 
that every part should be evenly done — never sticking a fork into the 
lean part, as that lets the juices escape ; it should be put inti) the 
outer skin or fat. When the meat is sufficiently broiled, it should be 
laid on a hot dish and seasoned. The best pieces for steak are the 
porter-house, sirloin, and rump. 

Thawing Frozen Meat, Etc.— If meat, poultry, fish, 
vegetables, or any other article oi food, when found frozen, is thawed 
by putting it into warm writer or placing it before the fire, it will most 



certainly spoil by 'liat process, ."tnd be rendered uriilt 



lu cai 



The 



only way to thaw these things is by immersing them in cold water. 
This should be done as soon as they are brought in from market, that 
tliey may have time to be well thawed before they are cooked. If

TO Keep Moat From Files. -Put in sacks, with enouL-h

a yard of yard-wide mushn is the ri^'ht size for the sink. I'ui a li le 
.travv ,n the bottom, then put in the ham and lay straw in all around 
It , le It tiKhlly, and han^' it in a cool, dry place. He sure the straw 
IS all around the meat, so the tlies cannot reach throu^,d. to deposit 
he CKK's. ( i he sackniK must be done early in the season befor.' the 
tly ai)pears.) Mushn Ins the air in and is much better than i, per 
1 hin mushn ,s as Kood as thick, and will last for years if uashed 
when laid away wh.en emptied. 

Roast Beef. -One very essential point in roasting beef is to have 
the oven well heated when the beef is tirst put in ; this causes the 
pores to dose up (lu.ckly, and prevents the escape of the jui. es 

lake a rib piece or l(,in roast of seven or ei^ht fmunds. Wipe it 
thorouKhly all oyer with a clean wet towel. Lay it in a dripping-pan 
and baste it well wuh butter or suet fat. Set it in the inlu. l/aste 
It frequently with its uwn drippings, which will mak.- u luuwn and 
tender. \\ hen partly dune, season with salt and pepper, as u hardens 
any meat to salt .t when raw, and draws out its juices then dredge 
with sifted (lour to give it a frothy appearance. It will take a roas^ 
of this size about two hours liuie to be properlv done, leaving the 
inside a httle rare or red-half an hour less would make the i^is c 
quite rare. Remove the beef to a heated dish, set where it will keep 
ho ; then skim the dri|)pings from all fat, add a tablespoonful ,f 
silted tlour, a little pepper and a teacupful of boiling water Boil up 
once and serve hot in a gravy boat. v. ' up 

Some prefer the clear gravy without the thickening. Serve with 
mustard or grated hursh-radish and vinegar 

Yorkshire Puddlng.-This is a very nice accompaniment to 
a roast of beef; the ingredients are, one pint of milk, four eggs, white 
and yolks beaten separately, one teaspoonful of salt, and tvvo tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder sifted through two cups of flour It 
should be mixed very smooth, about the consistency of cream 
Regulate your time when you put in your roast, so that it will be done' 
half an hour or forty minutes before dishing up. Take it from the

drippings from the dnpping-pan into these tins, pour half of the

the dmner is dished up ; take these puddings out at the last momen

and send to the table hot. This I consider much better than the 
old way of bakinj; the pudding under the meat. 

Beefsteak. No. 1. — The first consideration in broiling is to have 
a clear, glowing bed of c(ki1s. The steak should be about three- 
quarle's of an inch in thickness, and should be pounded only in 
extreme cases, -i.e. when it is cut too thick and is "stingy." Lav it on 
a buttered gridiron, turning it often, as i> ')egins to drij), attenipting 
nothing else while cooking it. Have everything else ready fur the 
table ; the potatoes and vegetables dished and in the warming closet. 
Do not scastjn it until it is done, which will be in about ten to 
twelve minutes. Remove it to a warm platter, pepper and salt it on 
both sides and spread a liberal lumji of InUter over it. Serve at once 
while hot. No definite rule can be given as to the time of cooking 
steak, individual tastes differ so widely in regard to it, some only liking 
it when well done, others so rare that the blood runs out of it. The 
best pieces for broiling are the p(jrter-h()use and sirloin. 

Beefsteak. No. 2. — Take a smooth, thick-bottomed frying- 
pan, scald it out with hot water, and ui])e it dry ; set it on the stove 
or range, and when very hot, rulj it over the bottom with a rag dipfied 
in l)utter ; then place your steak or chops in it, turn often until 
cooked thrcnigh, take uj) on a warm platter, and season both sides 
with salt, pepper and butter. Serve hot. 

Many prefer this manner of cooking steak rather than broiling or 
frying in a (|uantiiy of Lirca^c. 

Beefsteak and Onions. — Prepare the steak in the usual way. 
Have ready in a frying-pan a dozen onions cut in slices and fried 
brown in a little beef drippings or butter. Dish your steak, and lay 
the onions thickly over the lop. Cover and let stand five minutes 
then send to the table hot. 

Beefsteak and Oysters.— I'>roil the steak the usual way. 
Put one ([uart of oysters with very little of the litjuur in a stewpan 
U])on the fire ; when it comes to a boil, take oft' the scum that may 
rise, stir in three ounces of butter mixed with a tablespoonful of sifted 
flour, let it boil one minute until it thickens, pour it over the steak. 
Serve hot. 

To Fry Beefsteaks. — Heefsteal- for frying should be cut much 
thinner than for broiling. Take from the ribs or sirloin and remove the 
bone. Put some butter or nice beef dripping into a frying-pan, and 
set it over the fire, and when it has boiled and become hot, lay in the 
steaks ; when cooked tpiite enough, season with salt and pepper, 
turn and brown on both sides. Steaks when fried should be 
thoroughly done. Have ready a hot dish, and when they are done, 
take out the steaks and lay them on it, with another dish cover the 
top to keep them hot. The gravy in the pan can be turned over the 
steaks, first adding a few drops of boiling water, or a gra\-y to be 
served in a separate dish made by putting a large tablespoonful of 
flour into the hot gravy left in the pan, after taking up the steaks. 
Stir it smooth, then pour in a pint of cream or sweet rich milk salt 
and popper, let it boil up once until it thickens, pour hot into a gravy 
dish, and send to the table with the steaks.

BEEF 




Spiced Beef Relish.— Take two pounds of raw, tender beef- 
steak, chop it very fine, put into it salt, pepper and a little sage, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, add two roiled crackers made very 
fine, also two well-l)caten c^^s. Make it up into the shape of a roll 
and bake it ; baste with butter and water before baking. Cut in 
slices when cold. 

Fried Beef Liver.— Cut it in rather thin slices, say a quarter 
of an inch thick, ])our over it boiling water, which closes the pores of 
the meat, makes it impervious to the fat, and at the same time seals 
up tne rich juice of the meat. It may be rolled in Hour or bread- 
crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped in egg and fried in 
liot fat mi.xcd with one-third batter. 

Prccaccl Ccef. — First have your beef nicely pickled : let it stay 
in pickle a week ; then take the thin flanky pieces, such as will not 
make a handstjine dish of themselves ; put on a large potful, and let 
them boil until periectly done ; then pull to pieces, and season just as 
you do souse, with pei)i)er, salt, and allspice ; only put it in a coarse 
cloth and press down upon it some very heavy weight. 

The advantage of this recipe is that it makes a most acceptable, 
presentable dish out of a \rdil of the beef that otherwise might be 
wasted. 

French Stew — (irease the bottom of an iron j)ot, and place in 
it three or four jjounds of beef; be very careful that it does not burn, 
and turn it until it is nicely browned. Set a muffin ring under the 
beef to prevent its sticking. Add a few sliced carrots, one or two 
sliced onions, and a cupful of hot water, keejj covered, and stew 
slowly until the vegetables are done. Add pepper and salt. If you 
wish more gravy, add liot water, and thicken with flour. .Serve on a 
dish with the vegetables. 

To Pot Beef.— The round is the best piece for potting, and you 
may use both the ui)j)er and under part. Take ten pounds of beef, 
remove all the fat, cut the lean into square pieces, two inches thick. 
Mix together three teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pepper, one of cloves, 
one of mace, one of cinnamon, one of allspice, one of thyme, and one 
of sweet basil. Put a layer of the i)ieces of beef into an earthen 
pot, sprinkle a little of this spice mixture over this layer, add a piece 
of fat salt pork, cut as thin as possible, sprinkle a little of the spice 
mixture over the -pork, make another layer of the beef with spices 
and i)ork, and so on, until the pot is fi'lled. I'um over the whole 
three tablespoonfuls of Tarragon vinegar, or, if you prefer it, 
some other seasoning ; rovtr the pot with a paste made of fiour 
and water, so that no steam can escape. I'ut the pot into an oven, 
moderately heated, and let it stand there eight hours ; then set it 
away to use when wanted. 

Beef cooked in this manner will keep good a fortnight in moderate 
weather. 

It is an excellent rclisli for breakfast and may be eaten either warm 
or cold. \A'hen eaten warm, serve with slices of lemon. 

Stewed Brisket of Beef.— Put the part that has the hard 
fat into a stewpot, with a small quantity of water ; let it boil up

cover it very well. After 



son the tripe with 



pepper and salt, and i)ut it into a pot with milk and water mixeil in 
e(|ual c|u;intities. Hoil it an hour in the milk and water. 

lioil in a sau( (;pan ten or a dozen onions. When they arc quite 
soft, drain them in a colander, and mash them. Wij)e out your sauce- 
pan anu |)ut them on aKain, with a piece of butter rolled in flour and 
a wineglass of (ream or milk. Let them boil up, and add them to 
the tripe just before you send it to table. Kat it with pepper, vineyar 
and must.ird. 

It is best to Kivc tripe its first and longest boiling the day before it 
is wanted. 

To Fry Tripe.--]?oil the tripe the day before till it is quite tender, 
which It will n(Jt be in less than f(jur or five hours. Then co\er it and 
set it away. Ne.\t day cut it into long slips, and dip each |)iece into 
be.-iten yolk of ej^- and afterwards roll them in grated bread-crumbs. 
Have ready in a frying-pan over the fire some good beef-dripping. 
When it is boiling hot put in the tripe, and fry it about ten minutes, 
till of a light brown. 

\'ou may serve it with onion sauce. 

Boiled tripe that has been left from the dinner of the preceding day 
m.iy be fried in this manner. 

Fricasseed Tripe.— Cut a j^jund of tripe in narrow strips, put a 
small cup of water or milk to it, add a bit of butter the size of an egg, 
dredge m a large teaspooiiful of flour, or work it with the butter; 
season with pe]5i)er and salt, let it simmer gently for half an hour,' 
serve hot. A bunch of parsley cut small and put with it is an im- 
provement. 

Some put in oysters five minutes before dishing up. 
Tripe Lyonnaise.— Cut up half a pound of cold boiled tripe 
into neat squares. Put two ounces of butter and a tablespoonful of 
choppeil onion in a frying-pan and fry to a delicate brown ; add to 
the tripe a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and a little strong vinegar, 
salt, and cayenne : stir the nan to prevent burning. Cover the bot- 
tom of a platter with tomato-sauce, add to the contents of the pan 
and serve. 

To Clarify Beef Drippings.— Drippings accumulated from 
different cooked meats of Ix-ef or veal can be clarified by putting it 
into a basin and slicing into it a raw potato, allowing it to boil long 
enough for the potato to brown, which causes all impurities to flis- 
appear. Remove from the fire, and when cool drain it off from 
liie sediment that settles at the bottom. Turn it into basins or 
sm.dl jars and set it in a cool place for future use. When mixed 
>vith an equal amount of butter it answers the same purpose as

paste, lay some of the parboiled meat in to half till it ; put bits of 
butter in the size of a hickory nut all over the meat ; shake pepper over, 
dredge wheat flour (jver, until it looks white, then fill it nearly to the 
top with some of the water in which the meat was boiled ; roll a 
cover for the top of the crust, puft-i)aste it, giving it two or three 
turns, and roll it to nearly half an inch thickness ; cut a slit in the 
centre, and make several small incisions on either side of it, put the 
crust on, trim the edges neatly v.ith a knife ; bake one hour in a 
quick oven. A brca^l of veal will make two two-quart basin pies ; 
half a pound of nice corned pork, cut in thin slices, and parboiled with 
the meat, will make it very nice, and very little, if any, butter, will be 
recjuired for the i)ie ; when pork is used, no other salt will be 
necessary. Many are fond of thin slices of sweet ham cooked with 
the veal for pie. 

Veal Stew. — Cut uj) two or three pounds of ve.il into pieces 
three inches long and one thick. Wash it, put it in your stewpan 
with two quarts of water, let it boil, skim it well, and, when all the 
scum is removed, add ])eppcr and salt to your taste, and a small 
piece of butter ; pare and cut in halves twelve small Irish potatoes, 
put them into the stewpan ; when it boils, have readv a batter made 
with two eggs, two spoonfuls of cream or milk, a little salt and flour 
enough to make it a little thicker than for pan-cakes ; drop this into 
the stew, a spoonful at a time, while it is boiling ; when all is in, 
cover the pan closely so that no steam can escape ; let it boil twenty 
minutes, and serve in a deep dish. 

Veal Loaf.— Three pounds of raw veal, chopjied very fine, 
butter the size of an egg, three egs, three tablespoonfuls of cream or 
milk ; if milk use a small piece of butter; mi.\ the eggs and cream 
together; mix with the veal four pounded crackers, oue tcasjjoonful 
of black pepper, one large tablespoonful salt, one large t.iblespoonful 
of sage ; mix well together and form into a loaf. Bake two and one- 
half hours, basting with butter and water while baking. Serve cut in 
thin slices. 

Veal for Lunch.— Butter a good-sized bowl, and line it with 
thin slices ot hard-boiled eggs ; have veal and ham both in very thin 
slices ; place in the bowl a layer of veal, with pepper and salt, then a 
layer of ham, omitting the salt, then a laver of veal, and so on, 
alternating with veal and ham, until the bowl is filled ; make a paste 
of flour and water, as stiflf as it can be rolled out ; cover the contents 
of the bowl with the paste, and over this tie a double cotton cloth ; 
put the bowl into a saucepan, or other vessel, with water just up to 
the rim of the bowl, and boil three hours ; then take it from the fire, 
remove the cloth and paste, let it stand until the next day, when it 
may be turned out and served in very thin slices. An e.xcellent lunch 
in travelling. 

Veal Patties. — Cut portions of the neck or breast of vea! 'nto

without much f.il ; triin off the skin. Dip each in wheat flour, or 
rolled cracker, and beaten crr, then lay them into the hot grease, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, fry on both sides a fine brown. When 
done, take them up and place on a hot dish. If you wish a made 
gravy, turn otTthe superfluous grease, if any, stir into the hot gravy 
reniainnig a heaping spoonful of tlour, stirring it until smooth and 
free in>m lunij)-,, then turn into that a cup of cold water or milk ; 
season with pepper and salt, let it boil up thick. Vou can serve it 
in a sei)arate di-,li or pour it over the rliops. Tomato sauce is con- 
sidered hue, turned over a dish of hot fried or broiled chops 

Fried Mutton Chops. No. 2.— Prepare the chops by trim- 
ming <jft all extra tat and skin, season them with salt and pepper • 
dip each (-hr)p in beaten egg, then in rolled cracker or bread- 
crumbs ; dip again in the egg and crumbs, and so on until thev are 
well coated with the crumbs. Have readv a deep spider containing 
a pound or more of lard, hot enou.^h Ui fry crullers. Drop into this 
liot lard the chops, frying only a few at one time, as too many cool 
the fat. Pry them brown, and ser\e up hot and drv, (;n a w.irm 
platter. 

Mutton Cutlets Baked.— Prepare them the same as f.;r 
frying, lay lliein m a <lnpping pan with a verv little water at the 
..'Htom. Pake cjuickly, and ba.-,te often with butter and water. Make 
• nttle brown -r:t\y and turn u\er them when thev are served 

Baked Mutton Chops and Potatoes —Wash and peei 
some good potatoes and cut them into slices the thickness of a penny- 
piece. The tpiantity of potatoes must, of course, be decide.! ac- 
cording to the number (jf persons to whom thev have to be served • 
but It is a safe i)lan to allow two, or even three, potatoes for eac h 
|)erson. After the potatoes are sliced, wash them in twcj (n- three 
water-, to thoroughly cleanse them ; then arrange them neatly (in 
layers; m a brown stone dish proper for baking purposes. .Sprinkle 
a htlle salt and pepper between each layer, and mU\ a sufficient 
quantity of cold water to prevent their burning. Place 
the ihsh in a very hot oven— on the tojj shelf— so as to' brown the 
l)otatoes in a few minutes. Have ready some nice loin chops (say 
one for each person;; trim otT most of the fat; make them into a 
neat njund shape by putting a small skewer throuL^h each. When 
the i)otatoes are nicely browned, remove the dish from the oven, and 
place the chops on the top. Add a little more salt and pepper and 
water if required, ami return the dish to a cooler i)art of the »'n'en, 
where it may be allowed to remain until sufficiently cooked, which' 
will be about in three-quarters of an hour. When the upper sides 
of the chops are a nice crisp brown, turn them over so as to brown 
the other side also. If, in the cooking, the potatoes appear to be 
getting too dry, a little more water may be gentlv poured in at one 
coiner of the dish, only care must be taken to see that the water is 
ho- this tmu— not cold, as at rirst. The di.h in which the chops and 
potatoes are baked must be as neat-looking as possible, as it has to 
be sent to the table ; turning the potatoes out would, of course, spoil 
their api)earance. Those who have never tasted this dish have no

and water in a baking-pan with the nnittoneUes,\'md\'ook in" hot 
oven three-quarters of an hour. Baste often, and when done thicken 
the gravy, pour over the meat, garnish with parsley, and ser%'e on hot 

platter. 

Irish Stew — Time about two hours. Two and a half 
pounds of chops, eight potatoes, four turnips, four small onions, 
nearly .a quart of water. Take some choi)s from l(,in of mutton, 
p ace them m stcwpan in alternate layers of sliced potatoes and 
chops ; add turnips and onions cut into pieces, pour in nearly a ciuart 
of cold water ; cover stewpan closely, let it stew gently till vegetables 
are ready to mash and the greater part of gravy is absorbed ; then 
plac e in a dish ; serve it up hot. 

Mutton Pudding.-Line a two-quart pudding-basin with 
some beef suet paste ; fill the lining with thick mutton cutlets, 
slightly trimmed, or, if preferred, with steaks cut from the leg • 
season with pepper and salt, some parsley, a little thvme and two' 
slices of onion chopped fine, and between each layer' of meat put 
some slices of potatoes. When the pudding is filled, wet the edges 
of the paste around the top of the basin, and ccver with a piece of 
paste rolled out the size of the basin. Fasten down the edge by 
bearing all around with the thumb ; and then with the thumb and 
fuiefinger twist the edges of the paste over and over so as to give it 
a corded appearance. This pudding can be set in a steamer and 
steamed or boiled. The time required for cooKing is about three 
hours. Wnen done, turn it out carefully on a platter and serve with 
a rich gravy under it. 

This is a very good recipe for cooking small birds.

Pressed Lamb.— The meat, either shoulder or lep, should 
he put to boil in the morning with water ju:3t enouKh to cover 
It; when tender, season with salt and pepper, then keep it 
over the fire until very tender and the juice nearly boiled out. 
Remove it from the fire-place in a wooden chopping-bowl, season 
more, if necessary, chop it up like hash. Place it in a bread-pan, 
press out all the juice, and put it in a cool place to harden. The 
pressing is generally done by placing a dish over the meat and puttinvr 
a flat-iron-upon that. Nice cut up cold into thin slices, and the broth 
left from the meat would make a nice soup ser\-ed with it, addinjr 
vegetables and spices. 

Croquettes of Odds and Ends—These are made of any 
scr.ips or bits of good (ouA that happen to be left from one or more 
meals, and in such small ciuantities that they cannot be warmed up 
separately. As, for example, a couple of spoonfuls of frizzled beef and 
cream, the lean meat of one mutton chop, one spoonful of minced l)eef, 
two cold hard-boiled eggs, a little cold chopped potato, a little mashed 
potato, a chi.k's leg, all the gristle and hard outside taken from the 
meat. These things well chopped and seasoned, mixed with (me raw 
egg, a little flour and butter, and boiling water ; then m.ule into round 
cakes, thick like fish-balls, and browned well with butter in a fr%ink:- 
pan or on a griddle. ^ ^ 

Scraps of hash, cold rice, boiled oatmeal left from breakfast, every 
kind ,>f fresh meat, bits of salt tongue, bacon, pork or ham, bits of 
poultry, and crumbs of bread, may be used. They should be put 
together with care, so as not to have them too dry to be palatable, nr 
too moist to cook in shape. Most housekeepers would be surprised 
at the result, making an addition to the breakfast or lunch table 
Serve on small square? of buttered toast, and with cold celery if in 
season. '

CHAPTER XIV. 

PORK. 

Thk best parts and those usually used for roasting are the loin, the 
leg, the shoulder, the spare-rib and chine. The hams, shoulders 
and middlings are usually salted, pickled and smoked. Pork 
requires more thorough cooking than most meats ; if the least under- 
done It IS unwholesome. 

To choose pork : if the rind is thick and tough, and cannot be 
easily impressed with the finger, it is old ; when fres t will look 
cool and smooth, and only corn-fed pork is good ; swill or stiii-fed 
pork IS unfit to cure. Fresh pork is in season from October to April. 
When dressing or stuffing is used, there are more or less herbs used 
lor seasoning,— sage, summer savory, thyme, and sweet marjoram ; 
tnese can be found (in the dried, pulverized form, put up in smaU, 
light packages) at most of the best druggists ; still those raised and 
gathered at home are considered more fresh.

may be boiled with the pork, some of which should be laid around 
di'^h as a K-fnish. 

Tinu\~\ IcK of pork wciKhinj,' ci^ht fxainds, tlirce hours a 
water boils, and to he sininuMcd very gently 

Fresh Pork Pot-Ple.-Hoil 'a spare-rib, after removioK .. 
the tal ami cracking the hones, until tender; remove the srum a 
rises, and when tender season with salt and pepper ; iialf an hour 
before tune for serMn^ the dinner thicken the K'ravy with a little flour. 
Have ready another kettle, into whu h remove all the Ix.nes and most 
of the KHivy, leaviuK only sufficient to cover the p(,t half an inch 
above the rim that rests on the stove; put in the crust, cover tifiht. 
and b.iil steadily forty-five minutes. To prep.irc the .rust, work into 
hKhtdouKh a small hit of butter, roll it out thin, cut it in small s.iuare 
cakes, and lay them on the mouldinK-board until very liLdU. No 
steam should po.sil,ly escape while the crust is cookinK, and by no 
means allow the pot to cease boiling. 

Roast Spare Rib.-Trim off the rough ends neatly, crack 
tlu; nhs a. loss the middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper, 
fold over, stuff with turkey dressing, sew up tightlv, place in a dripping- 
j.an with a pint of water, baste frequently, turning over once so as to 
l)ake hotii sides equallv until a rich l)rown. 

Pork Tenderloins.— The tenderloins are unlike anv other 
part of the pork in flavour. They may be either fried or broiled ; the 
latter being dryer, rcjuire to be well-buttered before serving, which 
should be done on a hot platter before the butter becomes oily Fry 
them in a little lard, turning them to have them cooked through • 
when done, remove, .and keep hot while making a gravy by dredging 
a little flour into the hot fat ; if not enough atld a little 'butter or lard 
stir until browned, and add a little milk or cream, stir briskly, and 
pour over the dish. A little Worcestersliire sauce may be added to 
the f^ravy it desired. 

Pork Cutlets.— Cut them from the leg, and remove the 
skin ; trim them and beat them, and sprinkle on salt and pepper 
I repare some beaten egg in a jjan ; r.nd on a fiat dish a mixture of 
bread-crumbs, minced oni.jn and sa^e. Put some lard or drippings 
nuo a frymg-pan over the fire, and when it boils put in the cutlets • 
h.iving dipped every one first in the egg, an.l then in the seasoning 
Ivy them twenty or thirty minutes, turning them often. After you 
have taken them out of the frying-pan, skim the gravy, dredge in a 
little flour, give in one boil, and then pour it on the d'ish round the 
cutlets. 

Have apple sauce to eat with them. 

Pork cutlets prepared in this manner may be stewed instead of 
being fried. Add to them a little water, and stew them slowly till 
thorough y done, keeping them closely covered, except when you 
remove the lid to skim them. 

Pork Chops and Fried Apples.— Season the chops with 
salt and pepper and a little powdered sage ; dip them into bread- 
crumbs, try about twenty minutes, or uutil they are done Put 
them on a hot dish ; pour off part of th^ gravy into another pan to

a dry cloth. Never soak ham in tepid or hot water, as it will touL'hcn 
the meat. *• 

Broil over a brisk fire, turning the slices constantlv. It will reciuire 
about hve mmutes, and should be served the last thing directly from 
tne gridiron, placed on a warm platter, with a little butter and a 
sprinkle of pepper on the top of each slice. If han) or bacon is 
allowed to stand by the fire after it has been broiled or fried it will 
speedily toughen, losing all its grateful juices. 

Cold boilod ham is very nice for broiling, and many prefer it to 
using the raw ham. 

Potted Ham -To two jjounds of lean ham allow one pountl of 
fat, two teaspoonfuls of powdered mace, half a nutmeg, grated rather 
more than half a teaspoonful of cayenne. 

Af0(A:-Mmcc the ham, fat and lean together, in the above pro- 
portion, and pound it well in a mortar, seasoning it with cayenne 
pepper, pounded mace and nutme.^ ; put the mixture into a deeo 
baking dish and bake for half an hour ; then fjress it well into a stone 
jar, till up the jar with clarified lard, , over it closelv, and paste over 
It a piece of thick paper. If well seasoned, it will keep a lonu 
tmie in winter, and uiU be found very convenient for samlw ches etc 
Bologn.-^ Sausages. (Cooked).-- luo , unds of lean 
pork, two pounds ol lean veal, two pound, of fre.h lean beef, two 
pounds ()f fat salt pork, one pound beef suet, ten tablespoonfuls of 
jiowdei-ed sage, one ounce each of parsley, savourv. marjoram and 
hyme, mixed. 1 wo teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper, the same of 
black, one grated nutmeg, one tcasp.jonful of doves, one minced 
onion, salt to taste. Chop or grind the meat and .uet ; season, and 
s utt into beef skins ; tie these up, prick each in several places to 
allow the escape of steam ; put into hot, not boiling, water, and 
heat gradually to the boiling point. Cook .lowly for one hour • 
take out the skins and lay them to dry in the sun, ui)on clean 
sweet straw or hay. Rub the outsirle of the skins with oil or 
melted butter, ami place in a cool drv cellar. If v(ju wish to keea 
them more than a week, rub ginger or pepper on 'the outside, then 
wash It ott before using. Tlus ,. eaten without further cookin- 
Lut in round slices and lay sliced lemon around the edge of the 
dish, as many like to squeeze a few drops upon the sausage before 
eating. I hese are very nice smoked like ham.^. 

Country Pork Sausages.—.Six pounds lean fresh pork, three 
p<nmds of chine (at, three table.poonfuls of salt, two of black pepper, 
our tab cspooi.iul. of sifted sage, two of summer savourv. Choi) the 
lean and fat pork (mely, mix the seasoning in with your hands, taste 
and see that it has the right flavour, then put them into cases, either 
the cleaned intestines of the hog, or make long, narrow bags of stout 
muslin, iai-gc eiiouKii to unitain each enough sausage for a family 
dish. Fill these with the meat, dip in melted lard, and hang them in 
a cool dry, dark j)lace. Some prefer to pack the meat in jars, pouring 
mel ed lard oyer it, covering the top, to be taken out as wanted and 
made into small round cakes with the hands, then fried brown. Many

use 



cupful of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, salt, and a 
tahlespoonful of made mustard. Boil ten minutes. 

Celery Sauce.— Mix two tablespoonfuls of tlour with half a 
teacui)ful of butter ; have ready a pint of boiling milk ; stir the flour 
and butter into the milk ; take three heads of celery, cut into sm-^ll 
bits, and boil for a few minutes in water, which strain off; put the 
celery into the melted butter, and keep it stirred over the fire for five 
or ten minutes. This is very nice with boiled fowl or turkey. 
Another way to make celery sauce is : Boil a head of celery until 
(juue tender, then put it through a sieve ; put the volk of an egg in a 
basm, and beat it well with the strained juice of' a lemon ; add the 
( clery and a couple of s[)o<jnfuls of liciuor in which the turkey was 
t)()i!ed, salt and pepper to taste. 

Caper Sauce.— Chop the capers a very little, unless quite 
Miiall ; make half a pint of drawn butter, to which add the cajiers, 
with a large spoonful of the juice from the bottle in which they are 
old; let it just simmer, and serve in a tureen. Nasturtiums much 
resemble capers in taste, though larger, and may be used, and, in 
fact, are preferred by n)any. They are grown on a climbing vine, 
and are cultivated for their blossom and for picklings. When used' 
as capers they should be chopped more. If neither capers nor 
nasturtiums are at hand, some pickles chopped up f<;rn. a very good 
•substitute in t!ie sauce. 

Bread Sauce — One cup of stale bread-crumbs, one onion, 
two ounces of butter, pepper and salt, a little mac;c. Cut the onion 
fine, and boil it in milk till quite soft ; then strain the milk on to the 
stale bread-crumbs, and let it stand an hour. I'ut it in a sauce- 
pan with the boiled onion, pep[)er, salt and mace, (live it a boil, 
and serve in sauce tureen. This sauce can also be used for grouse' 
and IS very nice. Roast partridges are nice served with bread- 
crumbs, fried brown in butter, with cranberry or currant jelly laid 
beside them in the platter. 

Tomato Sauce.— Take a quart can of tomatoes, put it over 
the tire in a stewpan, put in one slice of onion, and two cloves, a 
little pepper and salt ; boil about twenty minutes ; then remove from 
the fire and strain it through a sieve. Now melt in another pan an 
ounce of butter, and as it melts, sprinkle in a tablespoonful of flour ; 
stir It until it browns and froths a little. Mix the tomato pulp with 
it, and it is ready for the table. 

E.xcellent for mutton chops, roast beef, etc. 

Onion Sauce.— Work together until light a heaping table- 
spoonlul of flour, and half a cupful of butter, and gradually add two 
cups of boiling milk ; stir constantly until it comes to a boil ; then 
stir into that four tender boiled onions that have been chopped fine. 
Salt and pepper to taste. Serve with boiled veal, poultrv or mutton. '

-I'lcl mustard, salt and pepper, and if you choose a tahlespoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce ; let this boil up, and if too thick, thin it with a 
iittle stock or fivavy, or even a little hot water with butter. Pour this 
when done through a tine sieve. Of course a larger quantity can be 
prepared at once than is mentioned here. 

Mushroom Sauce.— Wash a pint of sm;)il button mush- 
tooiiiN rciiiovu tlic stems and outside skins, stew them slowly in veal 
L ravy or milk or cream, adding an onion, and seasoning with pcpi)er, 
..lit and a little butter rolled in flour. Their flavour will be heightened' 
l)y salting a few the night before, to extract the juice. In dressing 
mushrooms, only those of a dull pearl colour on the outside and the 
under part tinged with pale pink should be selected. If there is a 
jioisonous one among them, the onion in the s.iuce will turn black. 
In sucii a case throw the whole away. Used for prniltry, beef or fish. 
Apple Sauce.— When you wish to serve apple sauce with 
meat i)iei)aie it in this way: Cook the apples until tliey are very 
tender, then stir them thoroughly so there will be no lumps at all ; 
add the sugar and a little ' -latine dissolved in warm water, a table- 
spoonful in a pint of sauce ; pour the sauce into l)owls, and when 
< old it will be stiff like jelly, and can be turned out on a plate. Cran- 
berry sauce can be treated in the same wav. .Many prefer this to 
plain stewing. 

Apples cooked in the following wav iot^k verv pretty on a tea- 
t.ible, and are appreciated by the palaic. Select'firm, round green- 
ings ; })aie neatly and cut in halves ; place in a shallow stewpan 
with sutticient boiling water to cover them, and a cupful of sugar to 
every six apples. Each half should cook on the bottom of the pan, 
and be reuKned from the others so as not to injure its shape. Stew 
slowly until the i)ieces are very tender ; remove to a dish carefully ; 
boil the syrup half an hour hunger ; pour it over the apples and eat 
cold. A few pieces of lemon boiled in the syrup adds to the flavour. 
I hese sauces are :: une accompaniment to roast pork or roast goose. 
Cider Apple Sauce.- Boil four quarts of new cider until it 
IS reduced to two quarts, then put into it enough pared aud ciuartered 
apples to fill the kettle ; let the wh(jle stew over a moderate tare four 
hours ; add cinnamon if liked. This sauce is very fine with almost 
any kind of meat. 

Old-fashioned Apple Sauce.— Pare and chop a dozen 
meuium-M/ed apples, put them in a deep pudding-dish, sprinkle 
over them a heaping coffee-cupful of sugar and one of water. Place 
them in the oven and bake slowly two hours or more, or until they 
are a deep red brown ; quite as nice as preserves. 

Cranberry Sauce.— One quart of cranberries, two cupfuls of 
sugar, and a pint of water. W^ash the cranberries, then put them on 
the hie with the water, but in a covered saucepan. Let them simmer 
until each cranberry bursts open ; then remove" the cover of the sauce- 
pan, add the sugar and let them all boil for twenty minutes without 
the cover. The cranberries must never be stirred from the time they 
are placed on the fire. This is an unfailing recipe for a most delicioi-,- 
preparation of cranberries. Very fine with turkey and game.

same berries, freed from their husk or rind. Red or cayenne pepper

material, the vegetables crisp and fresh, the oil or butter the very 
best, meats, fowl and fish well cooked, pure cider or white-wine 
vinegar— in fact, every mgredient first-class, to insure success. 

I lie vegetables u:.ed in salad are. Beet-root, onions, potatoes, 
cabbage, lettuce, celery, cucumbers, lentils, haricots, winter cress, peas, 
!< rench beans, radish, cauliflower,— all these may be used judiciously 
in salad, if properly seasoned, according to the following directions :

French Salad Dress! nfl^.— Mix „tK: >,alt^poon of pepper with 
one of salt ; add three i.d)k-,poonliiN of olive oil, and one even table- 
spoonful of onion, scraped tine; then one tablespoonfui of vinegar ; 
when well mixed, pour the mixture over your salad, and stir all 
till well mingled. 

The merit of a salad is that it should be cool, fresh and crisp. For 
vegetables, use only the delicate white stalks of lek- y, the small 
heart-leaves of lettuce, or tenderest stalks and leaves of the white 
(abbage. Keep the vegetable portions crisp and fresh, until the 
tunc for servmg, when add the meat For ( hicken and fish salads, 
i use the Mayonnaise dres>,ing. For simple vegetable salads, the 

1 renf :h dressing is most ajjpropriate, using onion rather than garlic. 

Mixed Summer Salad.— Three heads of lettuce, two tea- 
• po«»nlul.-, of green mublard leaves ; a handful of water-cresses ; 
live tender radishes ; one cucumber ; three hard-boiled eggs ; two 
teaspoonfuls of white sugar ; one teaspoonful of salt ; one teaspoon- 
ful of pepper ; one teasp(j(jnful of made mustartl ; (jne teacuptul of 
vinegar ; half a tea( ui)ful of oil. 

Mix all well together, and serve with a lump of ice in the middle. 

Chicken Salad.—Boil the (owls tender, and remove all the 
fat, gristle and skin ; mince the meat in small pieces, but do not 
hash it. 'Jo one chicken put twice and a half its weight in celery, 
cut m pieces of about one-quarter of an inch; mix thoroughly, and 
set in a co<j1 jjlace. 

In the meantime prepare a ".Mayonnaise dressing," and when 
ready for the table pour this dressing over the chicken and celery, 
tossing and mixing it thoroughly. Set it in a ccjol place until rexidy 
to serve. Garnish with celery tips, on cold hard-boiled eggs, lettuce- 
leaves, from the heart, cold boiled beets or capers ; olives. 

Crisp cabbage is a gooil substitute for celery ; when celery is not 
to be had use celery vinegar in the dressing. Turkey \akes a fine 
salad. 

Lobster Salad. No. 1.— IVf-pare a sauce witli die coral of 
a fme, new lob.->ier, boiled fresh for about half an hour. I'ound 
and rub it smooth, and mix ver- dually with a dressing made 
from the yolks of two 1 ij.,.cd eggs, a tablesjwonful of 

made mustard, three of s,.,.,,. oil, two of vinegar, one of white 
powdered sugar, a small teaspoonful of salt, as much black pepi>er, 
a i)inch of cayenne and two fresh yolks of eggs. Next fill your salad 
bowl with some shred Intuce, the better part of two, leaving the tanall 
curled centre to k-u fi your dish with. .Mingle with this the flesh 
of your lobster, torn, uroken or cut into bits seasoned with salt and 
pepper and a small portion of the dressing. Pour over the whole 
the rest of the <iressing ; put your lettuce-hearts down the centre and 
arrange upon tic Mdes slices of hard boded eggs. 

Lobster Salad. No. 2 — Using canned lobslc , take a 
can, skim off all the oil on the surface, and chop the meat up 
coarsely on a fiat dish. Prepare the same way six i^ads of celery ;

MS 






mounds of cress-leaves, which may be mixed with the salad when 
served. 

Cold Slaw.— Select the finest head of bleached cabbage- 
that is to say, one of the finest and most compact of the more 
delicate varieties ; cut up enough into shreds to till a large vegetable- 
dish or salad-bowl — that to be regulated by the size of the cabbage 
and the quantity required ; shave very tine, and after that chop up, 
the more thoroughly the better. I'ut this into a dish in which it is to 
be served, after seasoning it well with salt and pepper. Turn over it 
a dressing made as for cold slaw ; mix it well, and garnish with 
slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

Plain Cold Slaw. — Slice cabbage very fine ; season with salt, 
pejjpcr and a little sugar ; pour over vinegar and mix thoroughly. 
It is nice served in the centre of a platter with fried oysters around it. 

Hot Slaw. — Cut the cabbage as for cold slaw ; put it into 
a stewpan, and set it on the t(jp of the stove for half an hour, 
or till hot all through ; do not let it boil. Then make a dressing the 
same as for cold slaw, and, while hot, pour it over the h(jt cabbage. 
Stir it until well mixed and the cabbage looks coddled. Serve 
immediately. 

Tomato Salad. — Peel and slice twelve good, sound, fresh 
tomatoes ; the slices about a quarter of an inch thick. Set them 
on the ice or in a refrigerator whi'e you make the dressing. Make 
the same as " Mayonnaise," or you may use " Cream dressing." 
Take one head ai the broad-leaved variety of lettuce, wash, and 
arrange them neatly around the sides of a salad-bowl. Tlace the 
cold, sliced tomatoes in the centre. Pour over the dressing and serve. 

Endive — This ought to be nicely blanched and crisp, and is 
the most wholesome of all salads. Take two, cut away the root, 
remove the dark-green leaves, and pick off all the rest ; wash and 
drain well, add a few chives. Dress with Mayonnaise dressing. 

Endive is extensively cultivated for the adulteration of cotfee ; is 
also a fine relish, and has broad leaves. Endive is of the same 
nature as chicory, the leaves being curly. 

Celery Salad. — Prepare the dressing the same as for tomato 
salad ; cut the celery into bits half an inch long and season. 
Serve at once before the vinegar injures the crispness of the 
vegetal)Ie. 

Lettuce Salad. — Take the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs, and salt and mustard to taste ; mash it fine ; make a paste by 
adding a dessertspcKjnful of olive oil or melted butter (use butter 
always when it is difficult to get fresh oil; ; mix thoroughly, and then 
dilute by adding gradr.ally a teacupful of vinegar, and pour over the 
lettuce. Garnish by slicing another egg and laying over the lettuce. 
This is sufficient for a moderate-sized dish of lettuce. 

Potato Saiad, Mot. — Pare six or eight large potatoes^ 
and boil till done, and slice thin while hot ; peel and cut up three 
large onions, into small bits and mix with the potatoes ; cut up some 
breakfast bacon into small bits, sufficient to fill a teacup ; and fry it 
a light brown ; remove the meat, and into the grease stir three table-

PICKLES. 

I'rcKLKS should never be put into vessels of brass, copper or tin, as 
the action of ihe acid on such metals often results in poisoning the 
pickles. Porcelain or granite-ware is the best for such purposes. 

\'inegar that is used for pickling should be the best cider or white- 
wine, and should never be boiled more than five or six minutes as it 
reduces its strength. In putting away pickles, use stone or 'glass 
jars ; the glazing on common earthenware is rendered injurious by 
tlie action of the vinegar. When the jar ^s nearlv filled with the 
pickles, the vinegar should completely cover them,' and if there is 
any appearance of their not doing well, turn off the vinegar, cover 
with fresh vinegar, and spices. Alum in small (juantities is useful in 
inakmg them firm and crisp. In using ground spices, tie them up in 
nuislin b.igs. 

To green pickles, put green grape-vine leaves or green cabbage 
leaves between them when heating. Another wav is to heat them in 
strong ginger tea. Pickles should be kept closelv covered, put into 
glass jars and sealed tightly. 

"Turmeric" is Indian saffron, and is used very much in pickling' 
as a colouring. 

A piece of horse-radish put into a jar of pickles will keep the 
vmc.^ar from losing its strength, and the pickle., will keep sound 
much longer, especially tomato pickles. 

Cucumber Pickles — Select the medium, small-sized cucum- 
bers. P or one bushel make a brine that will bear up an egg ; 
heat it boiling hot and pour it over the cucumbers ; let them stand 
twenty-four hours, then wipe them dry ; heat some vinegar boiling 
liot, and pour over them, standing again twenty-four hours. Now 
change the vinegar, putting on fresh vinegar, adding one ouart of 
brown sugar, a pint of white mustard seed, a small handful of whole 
cloves, the same ot cinnamon sticks, a piece of alum the size of an 
egg, half a cup of celery seed ; heat it all boiling hot and pour over 
the cucumbers. 

Sliced Cucumber Pickle.— T.ake one gallon of medium-sized 
cucumbers, put them into a jar or pail. Put into enough boiling 
water to cover them a small handful of salt, turn it over them and 
cover closely ; repeat this three mornings, and the fourth morning 
scald enough cider vinegar to cover them, putting into it a piece of 
.'i.um as large as a walnut, a teacup of horse-radish root cut up fine ; 
then tie up in a small muslin bag, one teapoonful of mustard, one of 
ground cloves, and one of cinnamon. Slice up the cucumbers half of 
an inch thick, place them in glass jars and pour the scalding vinegar 
over them. Seal tight and they will keep good a year or more.

of time, and are generally considered excellent for flavourini: stews 
and other dishes. 

Pickled Cabbage. (Purple.)-Ciit a sound cahbatre into 
quarters, spread it on a large flat platter or dish and sprinkle thickly 
with salt ; set it in a cool place for twenty-four hours ; then drain off the 
l)nne, wipe it dry and lay it in the sun two hours, and cover with cold 
vinegar for twelve hrmrs. Prepare a pickle by seasoning enough 
vinegar to cover the cahl^age with equal quantities of rnace, allspice 
< innamon and black pepper, a cup of sugar to everv gallon of vinegar, 
and a teaspoonful of celery seed to every pint, ['ack the cabbage in a 
stone jar ; boil the vinegar and spices five minutes and pour on hot 
(over and set away in a cool, dry place. It will be good in a month. 
A lew slices of beet-root improves the colour 

Pickled White Cabbage—This recipe recommends itself as of 
a ( cli^htful flavour, yet easily made, and a convenient substitute for the 
old-fashioned, tedious methotl of pickling the same vegetable Take 
a peck of (luartered cabbage, put a layer of cabbage and one of salt 
let It remain over night ; in the morning s(]ueeze them and put them' 
on the fire, with four chopped onions covered with vinegar ; boil for 
half an hour, then add one ounce of turmeric, one gill of bla( k pepper 
one gill of celery seed, a few cloves, one tablespoonful of allspice a 
few pieces of ginger, half an ounce of mace, and two pounds of brown 
sugar. Let it boil half an hour longer, and when cold it is fit for use 
Four tablespoonfuls of made mustanl should be added with the other 
ingredients. 

Pickled Cauliflower.-Hreak the heads into small pieces, and 
iioi ten or fifteen minutes in salt and water ; remove fnjm the water 
and drain carefully. When cold, pla< e in a jar, and pour over it hot 
vinegar, in which has been scalded a liberal supply of whole cloves 
pepper, allspice and white mustanl. Tie the spices 'in a bag, and on 
reiiK.vmg the vinegar from the fue, stir into earh quart of it'two tea- 
spoonfuls of P>ench mustard, and half a cup of white sugar. Cover 
tightly and be sure to have the vinegar cover the pi( kle 

Pickled Green Peppers,— Take two dozen large, gree 1, bell 
peppers, extract the see;.s by cutting a slit in the side (so as to -ave 
them whole). Make a strong brine and pour over them ; let ti -m 
stand twenty-four hours. Take them out of the brine, and soak them 
in water for a day and a night ; now turn off this water and scald some 
vinegar, in which put a small piece of alum, and pour over them 
letting them stand three days. Prepare a stuffing of two hard heads 
of white cabbage, chopped fine, seasoned slightly with salt and a cup 
of white mustard seed ; mix it well and stuff the peppers hard and 
full ; stitch up, place them in a stone jar, and pour over spiced vineuar 
scalding hot. Cover tightly. *' 

Green Pepper Mangoe.— Select firm, sound, ureen oenners. 
and add .1 lew red ones, as they are ornamental and look well upon the 
table. With a sharp knife remove the top, take out the seed soak 
over night in salt water, then fill with chopped cabbage and green 
tomatoes, seasoned .vith salt, mustard seed and ground cloves. Sew

Watermelon Pickle.-Ten pounds of watermel.m rind boiled

t.No pounds of white su^ar, one cpiart of vinegar, half an ounce of 
doves, one- ounce of cinnamon. The syrup to be poured over the

Sweet Pickle for Fruit.-Most of the recipes for making a 
bueet !)H:kle for fruit, su< h as ding-stone peache., damsons, plums. 
• liernes, apricots, etc., are so similar, that we give that which is the 
most successively used. 

To every quart of fruit, allow a cup of white sugar and a large pint 
of good cider vinegar, adding half an ounce of stick < innanmn, one 
tablespoonful of whole cloves, the same of whole allspi.e Let it 
come to a boil, and pour it hot over the fruit ; repcit this two or 
hree days in succession ; then se 1 hot in glass jars if you wish to 
keep It for a long time. 

The fruit, not the liquor, is to be eaten, and used the s.ime as any 
pickle Some confound this v,,th "Spiced Fruit,^' which i" not 
treated the <uime, one being a pi, kle, the ot! t a spiced preser^'e 
boiled down thick. ' 

Damsons and plums should be picked with a needle, and peaches 
washed with a weak lye, and then rubbed with a coarse clot.h to re- 
move the fur. 

Pear Pickle.— Select small, sound ones remove thft blossom 
end, suck t'aem with a fork, allow to each quart of pears one pint 
of cider vinegar and one cuf) of sugar, put in a teaspoonful allspice, 
cinnamon and ch.ves to boil with the vinegar ; then add the pears 

anil boil, and seal in jars. 

Spiced Currants.— Seven pounds of fruit, four pounds of 
sugar, one pint of good cider vinegar, one tablespoonful of ground 
cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves. Put into a kettle and lx)il until 
the frmt is soft ; then skim out the fruit, putting it on dishes until the 
syrup IS boiled down thick. Turn the fruit back into the syrup again

Muforni in size, they shoukl be made so by cutting after they arc 

jiccled. The best part of a potato, or the most nutritious, is next to 

'lie skin, therefore they sliould be pared ver . thinly, if at all ; then, 

t okl, the cores shf)uld be cu: otit, thrown into cold water ai, I salted 

,1 little, and l)oiled luitil soft enoui^h for a fork to pierce through 

' .isily ; drain immediately, and replai e the ketth- on the tire with the 

' "vvr partly removed, until they are completely dried. New potatws 

-liiiuid be put into boiling water, and when partly done salted a little. 

riiey should be prepared just in time for cooking, by scraping off the 

iliiii outside skin. They reipiire about twenty minutes t'. boil. 

To Boil New Potatoos.— Do not have the potatoes dug 
lull}; before they are dressed, as they are never good when they 
have Iwen out of the ground some time. Well wash them, rub off 
the skins with a coarse cloth, and j)ut them in boiling water --altcd. 
Let them boil until tender ; try them with a fork, and when done 
l")ur the water away from them ; let them stand by the side of the 
(lie with the lid of the saucepan jiartially removed, and when the 
l)')tat(;es are thonnighly dry, put them in a hot vegetable dish, with a 
|)iere of butter the size of a walnut ; pile the potatoes over this, and 
serve. If the potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed off, boil 
them in their jackets ; drain, peel and serve them as above, with .1 
pieie of butter placed in the midst of f'icm. They recpiire twenty 
to thirty minutes to coi^k. Serve the- I .)! /id plain, (jr with melted 
butter over them. 

Mashed Potatoes.— Take liie quan; y needed, pare off 
the skins, ami lay lliein in ccjld watt- iialf an hour; then put them 
into a saucepan, with a little salt ; co\ ■- v.'ith water and boil them 
until done. Drain '.-ff the water and nuish them fine with a potato- 
masher. Have ready a piece of butt.;r the size of an e, <, melted in 
half a cup of boiling hot milk, and a go(xl pin<.h oi salt ; mix it well 
with the mashed potatoes until they are a smooth paste, taking ( are 
that they are not too wet. i'ut them into a vegetable dish, heap them 
up and smooth over the t(jp, put a small pie( c (jf butter on the top in 
the centre, and have dots of pepper here and there on the surface as 
large as a threepenny piece. 

Some prefer using a heavy fork or wire-beater, instead of a potato- 
masher, beating the potatoes quite light, and heaping them in the 
ilish without smoothing over the top. 

Browned Potatoes.— .Mash them the same as the above, 
put them into a dish that they are to be served in, smooth <jver 
the top, and brush over with the yolk of an egg, or spread on a 
bountiful supply of butter and dust well with tlour. Set in the oven 
til brown ; it will brown in fifteen minu;<s vsith a quick fire.

disliked, it can 1)0 omitted. 

Steamed Potatoes. — This mode of cooking potatoes is now 
much in vogue, particularly where they are wanted on a large 
scale, it being so very convenient. Pare the potatoes, throw the 



m 



no cold water 



tlu 



;led, ther 



Jt them m a steamer. 
Place the steamer over a saucepan of buiiing water, and steam the 
P'jtatoes from twenty to forty minutes, according to the size and sort. 
When the fork goej easily through them, they are dune ; then take 
them up, dish, and serve very quickly. 

Potato Snow. — Choose some mealy potatoes that will boil 
exceedingly white ; pare them, and cuok them well, but not so 
as to be watery ; drain them, and mash and season them well. 
Put in the saucepan in wliich they were dressed, so as to keep 
them as hot as possible ; then press them through a wire sieve 
into the dish in whch they are to be served ; strew a little 
hne salt ujion them previous to sending them to table. French cooks 
also add a small quantity of pounded Icjaf sugar while they are being 
mashed. 

Hasty Cooked Potatoes.— Wash and peel some pcjtatoes ; 
cut them into slices of about a (|uarter of an inch in 
thickness ; throw them into boiling salted water, and, if of good 
quality, they will l)e done in about ten minutes. 

Strain off the water, put the potatoes into a hot dish, chop them 
slightly, add pepper, salt, and a lew small pieces of fres! butter, and 
serve without loss of time. 

Favourite Warmed Potatoes.— The potatoes should 
be boiled whole with the skins on in plenty "f water, well 
salted, and are much better for being boiled the da> before needed. 
Care should be taken th.it they are not over-cooked. Strif) off the 
skins (not pare them with a knife), and slice them nearly a quarter 
of an inch thick. Place them in a chopping-bowl, and sprmkle over 
them sufficient salt and pepper to season them well ; chop them 
all one way, then turn the chopping-bowl half way around, and 
chop across them, cutting them into little square pieces, the shape 
of dice. About twenty-five minutes before serving time, place on 
the stove a saucepan (or any suitable dish) containing a piece of 
butter the size of an egg ; when it begins to melt and run over 
the bottom of the dish, put in a cup of rich sweet milk. When this 
boils up, put in the chopped potatoes ; there should be about a 
quart of them ; stir them a little so that they become moistened 
through with the milk ; then cover and place them on the back of 
the stove, or in a moderate oven, where they will heat through grad- 
ually. When heated through, stir carefully from the bottom with a 
spoon, and cover tightly again. Keep hut, until ready to serve. 
ikiked potatoes are very good warmed in this manner. 

Crisp Potatoes. — Cut cold raw potatoes into shavings, 
cubes, or any small shape ; throw them, a few at a time, into 
boiling fat, and toss them about with a knife until they are a uniform 
light brown , drain and season with salt and pepper. Fat is never

they are very fond of potatoes ; if they are, have plenty, and put in

Baked Potatoes. — Potatoes arc either baked in their jackets (^r 
peeled ; in cither case they should not be exposed to a fierce heat, 
which is wasteful, inasmuch as th.crcby a great deal of vcKCtablc is 
scorched and rendered uneatable. They should be frequently 
turned while bein^^ baked, and kept from touchini: each other in the 
oven or dish. When done in their skins, be particular to w;ish and 
brush them before bakini; them. If convenient, they may be baked 
in wood-ashes, or in a Dutch oven in front of the fue. When pared 
they should be baked in a dish, and fat of some kind added to pre- 
vent their outsides from becoming burnt ; they are ordinarily baked 
thus as an accessory to baked meat. 

Never serve potatoes, boiled or baked whole, in a < losely covered 
dish. They become sodden and clammy. Cover with a folded 
napkin that allows the steam to escape, or absorbs the moisture. 
They should be served proini>tly when (hjne, and reijuire about three 
(|uarters of an hour to one hour to bake them, if of a good size. 

Browned Potatoes with a Roast. No. 1. —About 
t'nree ([uarters of an hour hefor-j taking up your roasts, peel middling- 
sized potatoes, boil them until partly done, then arrange them in the 
roasting-pan around the roast, basting them with the drip[)ings at the 
^ame time you do the meat, browning them evenly. Serve hot with 
the meat. Many cooks partly boil the potatoes before putting 
around the roast. New potatoes are very good cooked around a 
roast. 

Browned Potatoes with a Roast. No. 2. — Peel, 
cook and mash the reiji; >ed quantity, adding while hot a little 
chopped onion, pepper and salt ; form it into small oval balls and 
dredge them with flour ; then place around the meat, about twenty 
minutes before it is taken from the oven. When nicely browned, 
drain dry and serve hot with the meat. 

Sweet Potatoes. — Boiled, steamed and baked the same as 
Irish potatoes ; generally cooked with their j.ickets on '•■Id sweet 
l)otatoes may be cut in slices across or lengthwise, and fr r_o as com- 
mon potatoes ; or may be cut in half and served .old. 

Boiled sweet i)otatoes are very nice. Boil until partly done, peel 
them and bake brown, basting them with butter or beef drippings 
several times. Served hot. They shoukl be a nice brown. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes. — Wash aud scrape them, split them 
lengthwise. Steam or boil them until nearly done. Drain, and put 
them in a baking-dish, placing over them lumps of butter, pepj)er and 
salt ; sprinkle thickly with sugar, and bake in the oven to a nice 
brown. 

Hiitiljard squash is nice c(x>ked in the same manner. 

Onions, Boiled — The white silver-skins are the best sjiecies. To 
boil them peel off the outside, cut off the ends, put them into cold 
water and into a stew pan, and let them scald two minutes ; then turn 
off that water, pour on cold water, salted a little, and boil slowly till 
tender, which will be in thirty or forty minutes, according to their size ;

whites are beaten till stiff, and then mixed with the yolks, flour and 
water. Dip each branch of the caiilitlowers into the mixture, and 
'^.■f them in hot fat. When done, take then off with a skimmer, turn 
into a colander, dust salt all ovc-r, and serve warm. Asparagus, 
celery, eKK'-pl'int, oyster plant are all fine when fried in this manner. 

Cabbage Boiled. — (ireat care is recjuisite in cleaning a cabbage 
for boiling, as it frc(|uently harbours numerous insects. The large 
drum-head cabbage recjuires an hour to boil ; the green savory 
cabbage will boil in twenty minutes. Add considerable ;>alt to the 
water when boiling. Do not let a laltbage b(jil too long, by a long 
boiling it becomes watery. Kemovc it from the water int(j a colander 
to drain, and serve with drawn butter, or butter poured over it. 

Red c.djbage is used for slaw, as is also the white winter cabbage. 
For directions to i)rcpare these varieties, sec articles Slaw and Sour- 
crout. 

Cabbage with Cream. — Rem<ne the outer lea\es from a solid, 
small-sizt'i head of cabbagf, .ind cut the remainder as tine as fcjr 
slaw. Have on the fire a sj)ider or deep skillet, and when it is hot 
l)ut in the cut calvbagc, pouring over it right away a pint of boiling 
water. Cover closely, and allow it to cook rapidly for ten minutes. 
Drain oft' the water, and add half a pint of luw milk, or part milk and 
cream ; when it boils, stir in a large teasi)oonful of either wheat or 
rice llour, moistened with milk ; add salt and pepper, and as soon as 
it comes to a boil, serve. Those who find slaw and other dishes pre- 
pared from cabbage indigestible, will not complain of this. 

Steamed Cabbage.— i'.ikc a sound, solid cabbage, and with a 
large sharp knife shave it very tinely. I'ut it in a sauce pan, pour in 
half a te.vcupful of water or just enough to keep it from burning ; 
cover it very tightly, so as to confine ;he steam ; watch it closely, 
add a little water now and then, until it begins to be tinder ; then put 
into it a larg*- tabIesi)oonful oi butler ; salt and pepf)er to taste, dish 
it hot. if y<ni pr(.-fer to give it a tart taste, just before taking from 
the fire add a third of a cup of good vinegar. 

Ladies' Cabbage. — Hoil a tirm white cal>bage fifteen minutes, 
changing the water then for more from the l)oi!ing tea-kettle. When 
tender, drain and set aside until perfectly < i Id. Chop fine and add 
two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, jiepper, salt, three t ible- 
spoonfuls of rich milk or cream. .Stn- all well together, and bake in a 
buttered pudding-dish until brown. Serve very hot. This dish 
resembles cauliflower and is very digestible and palatable. 

Fried Cabbage.— I'lace in a frying-pan an ounce of butter and 
heat it l)oiling hot. Then take cold boiled cabbage chopped fine, or 
cabbage hot, cooked the .same as steamed c abbage, put it into the 
hot butter and fry a light brown, adding two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 
\'ery good. 

French Way of Cooking Cabbage.— Chop cold boiled 
white cabbage and let it drain till perfectly dry ; stir in some 
melted butter to taste ; pepper, salt and four tablespoonfuls of cream ; 
after it is heated through add two well-beated eggs ; then turn the 
mixture into a buttered frying-pan, stirring until it is very hot and

Parsnips may be Ijoiled and mashed the same as potatoes. 
Stewed Parsnips. — After washing and scraping; the par- 
snips shce them about half of an inch thick. Put them in a 
saucepan of boiling water containng just enough to I)arciy cook them ; 
add a tcaspcwjnful of butter, season with salt and pt.'[)pcr, then cover 
closely. Stew them until the water has cooked away, watching care- 
fully and stirring often to |)revent burning, until they are soft. When 
tiiey are done they will bo of a creamy light straw colour and deliciously 
sweet, retaining all the goodness of the veg'etable. 

Parsnip Fritters. — Roil four or five parsnips ; when tender 
take off the skin and mash them fine ; add to them a teaspcxniful of 
wheat tiour and a beaten egg ; put a tablespoonful of hird or beef 
drippings in a frying-jjan over the fire, add to it a saltspoonful of 
salt ; when boiling hcjt put in the parsnips ; make it in small cakes 
with a spoon ; when one side is a delicate brown turn the other ; 
when both are done take them on a dish, put a very little of the fat 
m which tliey were fried over and serve hot. These resemble very 
nearly the taste of the salsify or oyster plant, and will generally be 
preferred. 

Creamed Parsnips.— IJoil tender, scrape and slice lengthwise. 
I'ut over the fire with two tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper and salt, 
and a little minced parsley. Shake until the mixture boils. Dish the 
parsnips, add to the sauce three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, in 
which has lieen stirred a (piarter of a spoonful of flour. Hoil once 
and |)our over the parsnips. 

Stewred Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water over a dozen sound 
rii)e tomat(JC.s ; let them remain for a few moments ; then peel off 
the skins, slice them, and put them over the fire in a well-lined tin or 
granite ware saucep.m. Stew them about twenty minutes, then add 
a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste ; let them stew 
liftecn minutes longer ; and serve hot. Some j)refer to thicken 
tomatoes with a little grated bread, adding a teaspoonful of sugar ; 
and others who like the flavour of onion chop up one and add while 
stewing ; then again some add as nmch other vegetable ingredients 
as there are tomatoes. 

To Peel Tomatoes. Put the tomatoes into a frying-basket, 
and plunge them into hot water for three or four minutes. Drain 
and peel. Another way is to place them in a flat baking tin and 
set them in a hot oven about five minutes ; this loosens the skins so 
that they rv.*adily slip off. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. Butter the sides and bottom of a 
pudding-dish. Put a layer of bread-crumbs in the bottom ; on them 
put a layer of sliced tomatces ; sprinkle with salt, pepper and some 
bits of butter, and a very little white sugar. Then repeat with 
another layer of crumbs, another of tomato, and seasoning until 
full, having the top layer of slices of tomato, with bits of butter on 
each. Pake covered until well cooked through ; remove the cover 
and brown quickly. 

Stuffed Baked Tomatoes. From the blossom-end of a

Indian Corn Boiled. -This .should be cooked on the same 
(lay it is gathered ; 11 loses it sweetness in a few hours and must be 
artifu ialiy supplied. .Strip of the hu^ks, pi( k out all the siik and put 
it in boiling water ; if not entirely fresh, add a tablespoonful of sugar 
to the water, but no salt; boil twtMity minutes, fast, ar.d serve; or 
you may cut it from the cob, put in (ilenty of butter and a little salt, 
and serve in a covered vegetable dish. The com is much sweeter 
when cooked with the husks on, but retiuires longer time to boil. 
Will generally boil in twenty minutes. 

(ireen corn left cner frcjm dinner makes a nice breakfast dish,

a pinch of salt, and a little butter. .Mi.x well into a thick batter, and 
fry in small cakes in very hot butter. Serve with plenty of butter 
and powdered sugar. 

Corn Puddingy. — This is a \'irginia dish. Scrape the sub- 
stance out (){ twelve ears of tender, green, uncooked corn fit is better 
scraped than grated, as you do not get those hu^ky panic les which 
you cannot avoid with a grater; ; add yolks and' whites, beaten 
separately, of fcnir eggs, a teaspoonful of sugar, the same of flour 
mixed in a tables of butter, a small cpiantity of salt and pepper, 
and one pint of milk. Bake about half or' three quarters of an 
hour. 

Stewed Corn. — Take a dozen ears of green sweet corn, very 
tender and juicy ; cut off the kernels, cutting with a large sharp knife 
from the top of the cob clown ; then scrape the cob. I'ut the corn into 
a saucepan over the tire, with just enough water to make it cook with- 
out burning ; l)oil about twenty minutes, then adtl a teacupful of nulk 
or cream, a tables])oonful of cold butter, and season with pepper and 
s.-ilt. 15oil ten minutes longer, and dish up hot, in a vegetable dish. 
I'he corn would be much sweeter if the scraped cobs were boiled first 
in the water that the corn is cooked in. 

.Many like corn cooked in this manner, putting half corn and half 
tomatoes ; either way is very gcxjd. 

Fried Corn. — Cut the corn off the cob, taking care not to 
bring off any of the husk with it, and to have the grains as separate 
as possible. Fry in a little butter, just enough to keep it from stick- 
uig to the pan ; stir very often. When nicely browned, add salt and

Wipe them clean and white with a wet flannel ; put them in a stew- 
pan with a little water, and let thom stew very gently for a (|uarter of 
an hour. Add salt to taste, work in a little flour and butter, to make 
the li(iuor about as thick as cream, and let it boil for five minutes. 
When you are ready to dish it up, stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream 
or the yolk of an egg ; stir it over the fire for a minute, but do not let 
it boil, and serve. Stewed button mushrooms are verv nice, either in 
fish stews or ragouts, or served apart to eat with fish. .Vnother way 
of doing them is to stew them in milk and water 'after they are rubbed 
white), add to them a little veal gravy, rnace and salt, and thicken the 
gravy with cream or the yolks (jf eggs. 

.Mushrooms can be cooked in the same manner as the recipes for 
oysters, either stewed, fried, broiled, or as a soup. They are also 
used t(^ flavour sauces, catsups, meat gravies, game and soiips. 

Preserved Mushrooms.— Preserved mushrooms may be 
served with good eftVct with game and even with beefsteak if prepared 
in this way: open the preserved jar and pour off every drop of the 
liquid found there ; let the mushrooms drain, then put them in a 
saucepan with a little cream, and butter, pepper and s.-.lt ; let theni 
simmer gently for from five to ten minutes, and when the iiieat is on 
the platter pour the mushrooms over it. If served with steak, that 
should be very tender, and be broiled, never in anv c.ise fried. 

Mushrooms for Winter Use — Wa>h ;md' wipe free from grit 
the small fresh button mushrooms. Put into a frying-pan a quarter 
of a poimd of the very best butter. /\dd to it two whole cloves, ,1 
saltspoonful of salt, and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. When hot, 
add a quart of the small mushrooms, toss them about in th(> butter 
for a moment only, then [)ut them in jars ; fill the top of ea( h jars with 
an inch or two of the butter and let it cool. Keej) the jars in a cool 
place, and when the butter is quite firm, add a top layer of salt. 
Cover to keep out dust. 

The best mushrooms grow on uplands, or in high, open fields, where 
the air i> ]>u!e. 

Truffles. — The trufifle belongs to the family of the mushrooms ; 
they are u^ed })rinci|)ally in this country ;'.s a condiment for boned 
turkey and chicken, scrambled eggs, fillets of beef, game, and fish. 
When mi.ved in due proportion, they add a peculiar zest and flavour to 
sauces, that cannot be found in any other plant in the vegetable 
kingdom. 

ItAlian Style of Dressingr Truffles.— Ten truffles, a 
f|uarter of a pint of salad-oil, pepper ami salt to taste, one tablesprxm- 
fu! of minced parsley, a very little finely minced garlic, two blades of 
pounded mace, one tablespoonful of lemon-juice. 

After cleansing and brushing the truffles, cut them into thin slices, 
and put them in a baking-dish, on a seasoning of oil (.>r butter, pepper, 
sail, paisley, garlic and mace, in the above ptoportion. Bake them 
for nearly an hour, and just before serving, add the icmon-juice and 
send them to table very hot

BUTTER AND CHEESE 4/3 

CHAPTER XXII. 

BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

To Make Butter — Thon. uglily scald the i hurn, then cool well 
w ;tli ire ur spiinj,' w.iter. Now pour in tlic thic k (ream : churn fast 
at first, then, as the butter ffjrms, more sIdwK ; always with perfect 
ri-u!arity ; in warm weather, pour a lit.le cole! water into the churn, 
should the butter form slowly; in win.er, if the cream is too cold, 
add a little warm water to briuK it to the proper temperature. When 
the butter has "(oine," rinse the sides of the churn down with cold 
u;iter, and take tiie butter up with the perforated dasher or a wooden 
ladle, turnuig it dexterously just below the surface of the buttermilk to 
catch every stray bit ; have ready some \ery ( old water, in a deep 
wooden tray ; and into this |)lunKe tlie dasher when you draw U from 
the churn; the butter will float off, leaving the dasher free. When 
you have collected all the butter, gather behmd a wooden butter ladle, 
and dram ott the water, squeezing and pressing tlie butler with the 
ladle ; then pour on more (old water, and work the butter with the 
ladle to get the nulk out, drain off the water, spiiukle salt over the 
butter,— a tablespoonful to a pound ; work ic in a little, and set in a 
(ool place for an iKjur to harden, then work and knead it until not 
another droj) of water exude-,, and the butler is pcrfectiv smootli .and 
close in texture and polish ; then with the ladle make up into rolls, 
linle balls, stamped pats, etc. 

The churn, dasher, tray and ladle, should be well scalded before 
using, so that the butter will not stick to them, and then cooled '-ith 
very cold water. 

W hen you skim cream into your cream jar, stir it well into what is 
already there, so that it may all sour alike ; ami no fresh cre.im should 
l)e put with It within twelve hours before churning, or the butter will 
not come quickly ; and perh.ips, not at all. 

Butter is indispensable in .almost all ( ulinary preparations. (hxkI, 
fiesh butter, used in moderation, is easily digested; it is softening, 
nutritious, and fattening, and is far more easily digestetl than any other 
ol the oleaginous subst.inces sometimes used in its place. 

To Make Butter Quickly— immediately after the cow is 
milked, strain into clean pans, and set it over a moderate fire until it 
IS scalding hot ; do not let it boil ; then set it aside ; when it is cold, 
skim off the cream ; the milk will still be fit for any ordinary use; 
when you have encnigh cream, put it into a ck-.m eart'hei, basin ; beat 
It with a wooden spoon until the butter is made, which will not be 
long ; then take it from the milk and work it with a little cold water, 
until It IS free from milk ; then drain off the water, j)ut a small table- 
spcxjnful of tine salt to each pound of butter, and work it in. A small 
teaspoonful of Hne whife sugar, worked in with the salt, will he found 
an ijiipruvcmcnt- ..ug.i! is .1 great preservative. Make the butter m 
a roll ; cover it with .1 bit of muslin, and keep it in a cool place. A

its flavour that many persons like it just as well as ire-cream. It is 
prepared thus : Make a (|uart of milk moderately warm ; then stir 
into it one large spoonful of the preparation called rennet, set it by, 
and when cool again it will be as stiff as jelly. It should be made 
only a few hours before it is to be used^ or it will be tough and 
watery ; in summer sot the dish on ire after it has jellied. It must be 
served with ixiwdcrrd sugar, nutmeg and cream. 

Cheese Fondu.—Melt an ounce of butter, and whisk into it a 
pint of boiled milk. Dissolve two tablcspoonfuls of flour in a gill of 
cold milk, add it to the boiled milk and let it cool. lUat the yolks of 
four eggs with a heaping teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of 
pepper, and live ounces of grated cheese. Whip the whites of the 
eggs and add them, pour the mixture into a deep tin lined with 
buuered jiaper. and allow for the rising, .say four inches. Bake 
twi'ntv- minutfv and serve the moment it leaves'the oven. 

Cheese SOMfflc. — Melt an ounce of butter in .i sauce pan ; 
mix smoothly with it one ount e of tlour, a pinch of salt and cayenne 
and a quarter of a pint of milk ; simmer the mixture gently over the 
(irc, stirring it all the time, till it is as thick as melted butter ; stir 
uuo it alxHit three ounces of finely-grated parmesan, or any good 
cheese. Turn it into a basin, and mix with it the yolks of two well- 
beaten eggs. Whisk three whites to a solid froth,' and just before 
the souffle is baked put them into it, and pour the mixture into a 
small round tin. It should be only half filled, as the fondu will rise 
very high. I'in a napkin around the dish in which it is baked, and 
ser\e the moment it is baked. It would be well to have a metal 
cover strongly heated. Time twenty minutes. Sufficient for six 
persons. 

Scalloped Cheese.— .Any person who is fond of cheese coi'!»i 
not faii i<j favour tliis recipe. 

Take tinee slices of bread, well-buttered, first cutting off the brown 
outside crust, (irate fine a quarter of a pound of anv kind of good 
cheese ; lay the bread in layers in a buttered baking-dish, sprinkle 
over it the grated cheese, some salt and pep[)er to taste. Mix four 
well-beaten eggs with three cups of milk ; pour it over the bread and 
cheese. Bake it in a hot oven as you would cook a bread pudding. 
This makes an ample dish for ftnir people. 

Pastry Ramaklns.— Take the remains or odd pieces of any 
light pufl'-pa-^te left from pics or tarts ; feather up the pieces of paste, 
roll it out evenly, and sprinkle it with grated cheese of a nice flavour. 
Fold the paste in three, roll it out again, and sprinkle more cheese 
over ; fold the paste, roll it out, and with a paste-cutter shape it in 
any way that may be desired. Bake the ramakins m a brisk oven 
from ten to fifteen minutes, dish them on a hot napkin, and serve 
quickly. The appearance of this dish may be very much improved 
by brushing the ramakins over with yolk of egg before the> are 
placed in the oven. Where expense is not objected to, parmesan is 
the best kind of cheese to use for making this dish. 

\'ery nice with a cup of coffee for a lunch.

This is far nitire delicate tlian fried eggs. 

Or prepare tlie eggs the same, and set tlicm in a steamer, over 
boiling water. 

They are usually served in hcjlels baked in individual dishes, about 
two in a dish, and in the same di-,h they wer<.' baked in. 

Scrambled Egg^s. — I'ut a tabiespoontui of butter into a hot fry- 
ing-pan ; tip around so that it will touch all sides of tije pan. Having 
ready half a dozen eggs broken in a dish, salted and pepjn riMl, turn 
them (without beating) into the hot butter ; stir them one way 
briskly for five or six minutes or until they are mixed. He careful that 
they do not get too hard. Turn over toast or dish up without. 

Poached or Dropped Eggs. — Have one (|uait of boiling 
water, and one t.iblespoonful of salt, in a frying-pan. lireak the eggs, 
one by one, into a saucer, and slide carefully into the saltetl water. 
Dash with a s|)oon a little water over the egg, to keep the to{j white. 

'i'he beauty of a |)oached egg is for the yolk to be seen blushing 
through the white, which should only be just sufficiently h.irdened to 
form a transparent veil for the egg. 

Co(jk until the white is firm, and lift out with a griddle cake-turner, 
and place on to.isted breail. Serve iiiiineiliately. 

A tablespoonful of vinegar put into the water, keejjs the eggs from 
spreading. 

Djjen gem rings are nice placed in the water and an egg dropped 
into each ring. 

Fried Eggs. — Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer, and 
then sliile lliciu carefully ott" into a frying-pan of lard anil butter mixed, 
dipping over the eggs the hot grease in spoonfuls, or turn them over — 
frying both sides without breaking tliem. They require about three

Kggs can be fried round like balls, by dropping one at a time into 
a ([uaniity <jf hot lard, the same .is for fried cakes, lir.-^t snrring the 
hot lard with a stick until it runs round like a whirlpool ; this will 
make the eggs look like balls. Take out with a skimmer. Eggs can 
be |)oaclu'd the same in boiling water. 

Eggs aux Fines Herbes. — Koll an ounce of butter in a good 
teaspoonful of flour ; season with pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; put it 
into a coffeecupful of fresh milk, together with two teaspoontuls of 
choj)ped parsley ; stir and sinmier it for tifieen minutes, add a tea- 
cupful of thick cre.im. Hard-boil hve eggs, and halve them ; arrange 
them in a dish with the ends upwards, pour the sauce over them, and 
tlecorate with little heaps of fried bread-crumbs round the margin of 
the dish. 

Poached Eggs a la Cremo.— I'ut a quart of hot water, a table-

spoonful of l,uttcr ; pepper and salt to taste, thicken with a very httle 
cornstarch ; let it boil up once, and turn it over the dish of poached 
CKKS- It can be served on toast or without. 

It is a better plan to warm the cream and butter in a separate dish, 
that tlu; cKKs may not have to stand. 

EffKS in Cases. -.Make little paper cases of buttered writing 
paper ; put a small piece of butter in each, an.l a little chopped 
parsley or oni.m ; pepper an.l salt. Place the ca.es upon .t ^ridin.n 
over a mcxierate hre of briK'ht . uals, and when the butter melts break 
a fresh e-^ ,nt„ c,i,.h case. Strew in upon them a few se!is..ned 
bread-crumbs, and when nearly done, Kla/.e the tops with a hot shovel 
Serve in the paper cases. 

Minced Eggs.-Chop up f<... ,r five hard-boiled egRs ; do not 
inim V then. Uh> tme. Put over the tire in a suital)Ie <lish a . upful of 
m.lk, a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper, and some savory 
cl.oppe<i small When this .:omes to a boil, stir into u a tablespoonful 
of Hour, diss<,Ived in a little cold milk. When it cooks thick like 
cream, put m the minced eg^s. Stir it Kcntly around and around for 
a few moments, and serve, garnished with sippets of toast. Any par- 
ticidar tUvouv may be ^iven to this <lish, such as that of mushrooms 
rutfles, catsup, essence of shrimps, etc., or some shred anchovy may 
be added to the mini c ' ' 

IVIixed EKK8 and Bacon.-Take a nice rasher of mild bacon • 
cut into squares no larger than dice ; fry it quicklv until nicely 
browned, but on no acount burn it. Hreak half a d<.ien vuiis into a 
basin strain and season them with pepper, add them to the bacon, 
stir the whole about, and, when sufficiently firm, turn it out into a 
(Usli. Decorate with hot pi( kles. 

Mixed EsTKs Qeneraily.-Savory or Sweet.- Much the 
same method IS followed in mixed eggs Kcnerallv, whatever mav be 
added to them ; really it is nothing more than an omelet whic'h is 
stirred about in the pan while it is being dressed, instead of beintr 
a lowed to set as a pancake. Chopped tongue, oysters, shrimps, 
s.ii dines, dried salmon, anchovies, herbs, mav be used 

Cold Ekks for a Picnic—This novel way of preparing 
cold egg for the lunch-basket fully repays one for the extri time

Omelets.— in making an omelet, care sho.ild be taken that the 
omelet pan is hot and dry. To ensure this, put a small quantity of

remove It ; wipe the i)an dry with a towel, and then put in a 'table- 
spoonful of butter. The smoothness of the pan is most essential as

ste\v|jan an (juncc of butter antl let it melt ; add the mushrooms, a 
teaspoonful of salt, half a tcaspoonful of pepper, and half a cupful of 
cream or milk. Stir in a teaspoonful of dour, dissolved in a little 
milk or water to thicken, if needed. Hoil ten minutes, and set aside

Make a plain omelet the usual way, and just before doublinK it, 
turn the mushrooms f)ver the centre and serve hot. 

Oyster Omelet.— Parboil a dozen oysters in their own liquor, 
skim them out, and let them cool ; add them to the beaten eggs, 
either whole or minced. Cook the s.ime as a phun omelet. 

Thicken the liquid with butter rolled in flour ; season with salt, 
cayenne pepjier and a teaspoonful of chopped parsl-jy. Chop up the

the omelet before folding ; when dished, p-ur the remainder of the 
sauce around it. 

Fish Omelet.— Make a plain omelet, and when ready to fold, 
spread (ner it lish prepared as follows ; Add to a cupful of any kind

and sifted bread ; soak it in either milk, water, cream, gravy, lemon 
juice, or other such liquid, according as the omelet is intended 
to be sweet or savoury. Well beat the eggs together with a little 
nutmeg, pepper and salt ; add the bread, and, beating constantly 
(or the omelet will be crumby), get ready a frving-pan, buttered and 
made thoroughly hot ; put in the omelet ; do it on one side onl> ; 
turn it upon a dish, and fold it double to prevent the steam from' 
condensing. Stale spong-cake, grated biscuit, or pound cake, may 
replace the bread for a sweet omelet, when pounded loaf-sugar should 
be sifted over it, and the dish decorated with lumps of currant jelly. 
This makes a nice dessert.

to a cream, add the other ingredients and mix thoroughly ; then stir 
in as much chopped ham as will make it consistent, and spread 
between thin slices of bread. Omit salad oil and substitute melted 
butter, if preferred. 

Ham Sandwiches, Plain.— Trim the crusts from thin 
slices of bread : butter them, and lay between every two some thin 
slices of cold, boiled ham. Spread the meat with a little mustard, 'f 
liked. 

Chicken Sandwiches.— Mince up fine any cold boiled or 
roasted chicken ; put it into a saucepan with gravy, water or cream 
enough to soften it ; add a good jiiece of butter, a pinch of pepper ; 
work it very smooth while it is heating until it looks almost like a 
paste. Then spread it on a plate to cool. Spread it between slices 
of buttered bread. 

Sardine Sandwiches.— Take two boxes of sardines, and 
throw the contents into hot water, having first drained away all the oil 
A few minutes will free the sardines from grease, i'our away the 
water and dry the fish in a cloth ; then scrape away the skini: and 
pound the sardines in a nortar till reduced to paste ; add pepper, 
salt, and some tiny pieces of lettuce, and spread on the sandwiches, 
which have been previously cut as above. The lettuce adds very

General Directions.-The first thing required 'for making 



BREAD 



185 



wholesome bread is the utmost cleanliness ; the next is the sf)unclness 
and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it ; and, in addition to 
these, there must be attention and care through the whole process. 

In mixing with milk, the milk should be boiled— not simply 
.-.(aided, but heated to boiling over hot water — then set aside to cool 
l)(;fore mixing. Smiplc heating will not prevent bread from turning 
sour in the rising, while boiling will act as a preventive. So the milk 
should be thoroughly scalded, and should be used when it is just 
blood warm. 

Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient time allowed for the 
dough to rise, will cause the Inead to be heavy. 

The yeast must be good and fresh if the bread is t(j be digestible 
and nice. Stale yeast produces, instead of vinous fermentation, an 
acetous fermentation, which tlavours the bread and makes it disagree- 
able. Poor yeast produces an imperfect fermentati(jn, the result being 
a heavy, unwholesome loaf. 

If either tlie sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself— 
that is to say, if the mi\ing and kneading be neglected when it has 
reached the proper poin' for either— sour Ijread will proloably be the 
consequence in warm weather, and bad bread in any. The goodness 
will also be endangered l)y placing it so near a fire as to make any 
part of it hot, instead of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of 
heat required for it-, due fermentation. 

Heavy bread will also mo-.t likely be the result of making the dough 
very hard, and letting it become quite cold, particularly in winter. 

An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half-made, 
and to allow it to become cold before it is finished. The other most 
common causes or failure are using yeast which is no longet sweet, 
or which has been frozen, or has not hot liquid poured over it. 

As a general rule, the oven for bnk'ng bread should be rather 
quick, and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without 
hardening the outside. The oven-door should not be (jpened after 
the bread is put in until the dough is set or has become firm, as the 
cool air admitted will have an unfavourable effect on it. 

The dough should -ise and the bread begin to brown after about 
fifteen minutes, but only slightly. 15ake from fifty to si.xty minutes, 
and have it brown, not black or whitey brown, but brown all over 
when well baked. 

When the bread is baked, remove the loaves immediately from the 
pans, and place them where the air will circulate freely around them 
and thus carry off the gas which has been formed, but is no longer 
needed. 

Never leave the bread in the pan or on a pine table to absorb the 
odour of the wood. If you like crusts that are crisp do not cover the 
loaves ; but to give the soft, tender, wafer-like consistency which 
many prefer, wrap thciii, while stili hot, in several ihicknesscb of 
bread-cloth. When cold put them in a stone jar, renioving the cloth, 
as that absorbs the moisture and gives the bread an unpleasant taste 
and odour. Keep the jar well covered, and carefully cleansetl from 
crumbs and stale pieces. Scald and dry it thoroughly every two or

Compressed yeast is better than anv other. It is sold in all

makmg a h')lc m the uiRldle o*" it, and i)ut m a one ( ake of iire- 
parcd compressed yeast, dissolved in oue half-cup of lukewarm 
water to two .piarts of flour ; stir the yeast lightlv, then pour in vour 
wetting, ■ either milk or water, as you (hoose,— which use warm in 
winter, and ( old m summer ; if you use water as " wetting," dissolve 
It in a bit of butter of the size of an egg,— if vou use milk, no butter 
IS necessary; stir in the "wetting" very lightlv, but do not mi.x all 
the tlour into It ; then cover the i)an with a thick blanket or towel, 
and set it, in winter, in a warm place to rise,— this is called "putting 
the bread in sjionge." In summer the bread should not lie wet over 
mght. In the morning add a teaspoonful of salt and mix all the 
tlour in tlie pan with the sponge, kneading it well ; then let it stand 
two hours or more until it has risen quite light ; then remove the 
dough to the moulding-board and mould it for a long time, cutting it 
in pieces and moulding them together again and again, until the 
dough is elastic under the pressure of your hand, using as little flour 
as possible ; then make it into loaves, put the loaves into baKing-tins. 
1 he loaves should come half-way up the pan, and thev should be 
allowed to rise until the bulk is doubled. When the h.ives are ready 
to be put into the oven, the oven should be readv to receive them. 
It should l)e hot enough to brown a teaspoonful of flour in five 
nunutes. I he heat should be greater at the bottom than at the top of 
the oven, and the fire so arranged as to give sufficient strength of heat 
through the Ijaking without being replenished. Let them stand ten or 
hfteen nunutes, prick them three or four times with a fork, bake in a 
(juick oven from forty-five to si.xty minutes. 

After making bread a few times the cook will become familiar with 
the appearance of the tlough, and can then safelv vary the time, and 
try any other experiments that her ingenuity may suggest. 

Keep well covered in a tin box or'large stone crock, which should 
be wiped out every day or two, and scalded and dried thoroughly in 
the sun (jnce a week. ' 

Bread.— Use for two loaves of bread three tjuarts of sifted 
flour, nearly a quart of warm water, a level tablespoonful of salt, and 
one cake of prepared compressed yeast. Di^,M)lve the yeast in 
a pint of lukewarm water ; then stir into it enout'h flour to make a 
thick batter. Cover the bowl containing the batter or spimge with a 
thick folded cloth, and set it in a warm place to rise ; if the tempera- 
ture of heat is properly attended to, the sponge will be foamy and

li>,'ht in half an hour. Now stir into this spooKC the salt dissolved in 
in a little warm water, add the rest of the flour and sufficient warm 
water to make the do'i^'h stiff enouKh to knead ; then knead it from 
five to ten minutes, divide it into loaves, knead a^ain eac h loaf and 
put them into hi. tered l)akin<,^-tins ; cover them with a doubled thii k 
cloth, and set a^'ain in a warm place to rise t^.ice tlu'ir heiKht, then 
bake the same as any bread. This bread has the advanta^^e of that 
made of home-made yeast as it is made inside of three hours, whereas 
the other reciulics from twelve to fourteen hoiu's. 

Salt-Raising Bread. ^While K'l-'ttinK breakfast in the morning, 
as soon as the tea-kettle has boiled, take a cjuart tin < up or an 
earthen quart milk pitcher, scald it, then fill one-third full of water 
about as warm as the tinker could be held in ; then to this add a 
teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of brown su^'ar and coarse floi'- enough to 
make a batter of about the right consistency for griddlc-> ,..;es. Set 
the cup, with the spoon in it, in a closed vessel half-filled with water 
moderately hot, but not scalding. Keep the tempenituie as nearly 
even as possible, and add a teaspoonful of flour once or twice during 
the process of fermentation. The yeast oukIu to reach to the top of 
the bowl in about five hours. Sift your flour into a pan, make an 
opening in the centre, and pour in your yeast. Have ready a pitcher 
of warm milk, salted, or milk and water, (not too hot or you will scald 
the yeast germs,) and stir rapidly into a pulpy mass vvith a spoon. 
Cover this sponge closely, and keep warm for an hour, then knead 
into loaves, adding flour to make the proper consistency. I'lace in 
warm, u ell-greased pans, cover closely, and leave till it is light. Hake 
in a steady oven, and when done let all the hot steam escape. Wrap 
closely in damp towels, and keep in closed earthen jars until it is 
wanted. 

This in our grandmothers' time used to be considered the prize 
bread, on account of its being sweet and wholesome, and required no 
prepared yeast to make it. Nowadays yeast-bread is made with very 
little trouble, as prepared yeast can be procured at almost any 
grocer. 

Household Bread.— The recipe for the far-famed household 
bread is as follows : 

This rule is more elaborate than the preceding ones and takes more 
time, but the results are excellent. 

Use one quart of milk, lard the size of an egg, or, what is its 
equivalent in actual measurement, a rounded tablespoonful, two 
quarts of flour, one of them even, the other a heaping (juart ; one 
cake of prepared compressed yeast, a heaping teaspoonful of salt, 
and an even teaspoonful of white sugar Dissolve the yeast and 
sugar in a very little tepid water, just as little as possible ; scald the 
lard in the milk, add the salt, and when cool, add to the yeast, and 
stir in the tlour to make a rather stiff dough, but do not knead, let it 
. . -e '!rt. U:^i:\. , 1:1 lue !ijvi:!;:i^, uic vciV r;;-,i tiling, i^iir it v.iuv.Ti, 
and when it is risen again do not knead, but shake with the flour on 
the board, take out the dough and work with the hands just enough 
to make it smooth and free from the flour ; put into the pans to rise

This is similar to the old-fashic^ned ryo bread of our Krandmothcrs' 
days, but tliat was placed in a kcttli-, allowed to rise, then jilaced in a 
' ovcrcd iron pan upon tho hearth l)cfore the fire, with (ouls heaped 
iiI)on tlic lid, to bakf all ni^ht. 

French Bread.— licat to-ether one pint of niiik, four table- 
s|)0(jnhil^ (.1 iiKltfd butter, or half butter or half lard, one cake of 
prepared yeast dissolved in lukewarm water, one teasf>oonful of salt 
and two e^j^s- Stir into this two (piarts of flour. When this dou^'h 
IS risen, tnake into two large rolls, and bake as any bread. 

Twist Bread. -l.et the bread be made as' directed for wheat 
Cut a( ross the top diaj,'onal j;ashes just before putting into the oven 
bread, then takt- three pieces as large as a pint bowl eadi ; strew a 
little tlour over the paste-board or taljle, roll eai h |)ie( e under your 
hands, to twelve inches length, making it smaller in circumference 
at the ends than in the middle ; iiaving rolled the three in this way, 
take a baking-tin, lay one part in it, join one end of ea( h of the other 
two to it, and braid them together the length of the rolls, and join the 
ends by |)ressing them togethc-r ; dip a brush in milk, and |)ass it over 
the to]) of the loaf ; after ten minutes or so, set it in a (piic k oven and 
bake for nearly an hour. 

Corn Cake. — One cjuart of milk, one pint of corn-meal, one 
teacupful of uhe.it (lour, a teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter. .S( aid tiie milk, and gradually pcnir it on the meal ; 
when cool, add the butter and salt, also a' half cake of prepared 
yeast. iJo this at night ; in the morning beat th<jroughly and add 
two well-beaten eggs. Tour the mixture into buttered deep earthen 
plates, let it stand fifteen minutes to rise again, then bake from 
twenty to thirty minutes. 

German Bread.— One pint of milk well boiled, one teacup- 
ful of sugar, two tablesp(j()nfuls of nice lard or butter, one cake of 
prepared yeast. .Make a rising with the n)ilk and yeast ; when 
light, mix in the sugar and shortening, with flour enough to make as 
soft a dough as can be handled. Flcur the paste-board well, roll out 
about one-half inch thick ; put this quantity into two large pans ; 
make about a dozen indentures with the finger on the top ; put a 
small piece of butter in each, and sift over the whole one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar mixed with one teaspoonful of cinnamon. Let this stand 
for a second rising ; when ])erfectly light, bake in a cjuick oven 
fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Corn Bread. — Two cups of sifted meal, half a cup of flour, 
two cups of sour milk, two well-beaten eggs, half a cup of molasses 
or sugar, a teasjjoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 
Mix the me.il and flour smoothly and gradually with the milk, then 
the butter, molasses, and salt, then the beaten eggs, and lastly 
dissolve a cake of prepared yeast in a little sweet milk and beat 
thoroughly all together. Hake nearly an hour in well-buttered tins, 
not very shallow. 

Virginia Corn Bread.— Three cups of white corn-meal, 
one cup of flour, one tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of

nips of milk, and three epk^^. Sift to^'cther the flour, rorn-tucal, 
sii^ar and salt ; ruh in the lard cold, add the ckr-s a-11 beaten and 
then the milk into which the yeast has been dissolved. Mix into a 
moderately stiff batter ; pour it into well-Kreased, shallow baking- 
|)ans ('i)u-tins art- suitable". Hake from tliirtv to forty minutes. 

Northern Corn Bread.— One rn\> of sweet milk, two of sour 
milk, two-thirds of a cup of mola^-.es, one of wheat tlour, flour of 
corn-meal, and one cake of preiiared yeast : steam for three hours, 
and l)ro\vn a few minutes in the oven. 

Indian Loaf Cake — Mix a teacupful of powdered white 
siiK'ii- with a quart of nrh mjlk, and cut up in the milk two ounces of 
butter, addiuK 'i saltspoonful of salt, i'ut this mixture into a covered 
pan ()r skillet, and set it on the (ire till it is scaldinK ^lot. Then take 
It off, and scald with it as much yellow Indian meal (previously sifted) 
as will make it of the consistency of thick boiled mush. Heat the 
whole very hard for a q.iaiter of an hour, and tlu-n set it away to 
i.ool. ' 

While it is cooling, beat three eggs very light, and stir them 
gradually into the mixture when it is about as warm as new milk. 
Add a tcai:u|)ful of lukewarm water into whi( h has been dissolved a 
cake of prepared yeast and beat the whole ancjther quarter of an 
hour, for much of the goodness of this cake depends on its being 
long and well beaten. Then ha\e ready a tin mould or earthen pan 
with a pipe in the centre (to diffuse the heat through the middle of 
the cake;. The pan must be very well buttered, as Indian meal is 
apt to stick. I'ut in the mixture, cover it. and set in a warm place 
to rise. It should be light in about four lunirs. Then bake it two 
hours in a moderate oven. When done, turn it out with the broad 
surface downwards, and send it to table hot and whole. Cut it 
into slices and eat it with butter. 

This will be found an excellent cake. If wanted for breakfast, mix 
It, and set it to rise the night before. If properly made, standing all 
night will not injure it. Like all Indian cakes, (of which this is^one 
of the best,) it should be eaten warm. 

Johnnie '^ake— Sift one quart of Indian meal into a \r,m ; 
make a hole in the middle and pour in a pint of warm water, adding 
one teaspoonful of salt ; with a spoon mix the meal and water 
gradually into a soft dough; stir it very brisklv for a quarter of an 
hour or more, till it becomes light and spcmgy ; then spread the 
dough smooth and evenly on a straight, flat board (a piece of 
the head of a flour-barrel will serve this purpose) ; place the board 
nearly upright before and open fire, and put an iron against the back 
to support It ; bake it well ; w;,; . done cut it in squares ; send it hot 
to table, split and buttered. 

Spider Corn Cake.— Ueat two eggs and one-fourth cup 
sugar together. Then add two cups sweet milk, in which you have 
dissolved unc half cake of prepared yeast. Add a teaspoonful of 
salt. Then mix one and two-third cups of granulated corn-meal 
and one-third cup flour with this. Put a spider or skillet on the 
range, and when it is hot melt in two tablespoonfuls of butter. Turn

griddle could be heating. Take a small stick like a good-si/ed 
skewer, wind a bit of cloth around the end of it, fasten it bv winding 
a piece of threaci around that and tving it firm. Melt together a 
tablesi)oonful of butter and lard. Grease the griddle with -bis

then j)are one large pine-apple, cut it in slices a quarter of an inch 
thick, cut the slices in halves, dip them into the batter and fry tliem, 
and serve them as .above.

you drop in the fritters, causes them to .issume a round shape like 

halls. 

Oannelons or Fried Piiffs.—Half a pound of pufT paste; 
aprirot, or any kind of picscrvt? tliat may he preferred ; hot lard. 

Cannelons, whi( h are made of puff-paste, n)iled very fhin, with jam 
cnclohcd, and cut out in lonj^, narrow roils or puffs, make a very 
jiretty and ' '..-K'lnt dish. .Make some j^ood puff paste, roll it out very 
thin, and cu. it into i)ie(:es of an equal size, about two inches wide and 
eijiht in.:hes Um^ ; place upon each piece a spoonful of jam, wet the 
cd^es with the white of e^K, and fo.d the paste over twice ; slij^htly 
press the edi^es toKcther, that the jam may not escape in the frying ; 
and when all are prei)ared, fry them in hoilinj,' lard until of a nice l)rown, 
lettinK them remain by the side of the fire after they are coloured, 
that the paste may be thoriniKhly d(jnc. Drain them before the fire, 
dish on a d'oylcy, sj)rinkle over them sifted su^ar, and serve. These 
cannelons are very delicious made with fresh, instead of preserved 
fruit, such as strawberries, rasj)berries, or currants : they should be 
laid in the paste, plenty of pounded sugar sprinkled over, apd folded 
and fried in the s.'imo manner as stated alxne. 

Qerman Fritters. — Take slices of stale bread cut in rounds, or 
stale ( akc ; fry ihciii in hot lard, like crullers, to a light iirown. Dip 
each sill (■ when fried in boiling milk, to remove the grease ; drain 
(juickiy, dust with i)owdered sugar, or spread with preserves, i'ile on 
a hot plate, and serve. Sweet sauce poured over them is very nice. 

Hominy Fritters. — Take one pint of hot boded hominy, two eggs, 
half a teaspoonfu! of salt, and a tablespoonful of flour ; thm it a little 
with cold milk ; when cold, add a leaspoonful of baking-powder, mi.\ 
thoroughly, drop tablesjjoonfuls of it into hot fat and fry to a delicate 
l)rown. 

Parsnip Fritters. — Take three or four gocul-sized parsnips. Boil 
them until tender. Mash and season with a little butter, a pinch of 
salt and a slight sj)rinkling of pepper. Have ready a plate with some 
sifted flour on it. Drop a tal)lespoonful (jf the parsnip in the flour and 
roll it about until well-coateil and formed into a ball. When you have 
a sufficient number ready, droiJ them into boiling drippings or lard, 
as yi n would a fritter ; fry a delicate brown, and serve hot. Do not 
put them in a coveted dish, for that would steam them and dejjrive 
them of their crispness, which is one of their great (harms. 

These are also very good fried in a frying-pan with a small ciuantity 
of lard and butter mixed, turning them over so as to fry both sides 
brown. 

Indian-Corn Fritters.— One pint of grated, young and 
tender, Indian corn, three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, 
one tablespoonful of melted butter, if milk is used, a teaspoonful of 
salt. Beat the eggs well, add the corn by degrees, also the milk and 
butter ; thicken with just enough flour to hold them together, adding 
a teaspouiiful of baking-powder to the ilour. Have icady a kettle of 
hot lard, drop the corn from the spoon into the fat and fry a light 
brown. They are also nice fried in butter and lard mixed, the same 
as fried eggs.

buttered toast. The sauce must be seasoned to taste with pepper and 
salt. 

Cheese Toast. No 1.— Toast thin slices of Kiread an even, 
crisp brown. I'lai e on a warm jilatc, allowing one small slice to each 
person, and ])our on enough melted cheese to cover them. Rich new 
cheese is best. Serve while warm. Many prefer a little [)repared 
mustard spread over the t(jast before putting on the cheese. 

Cheese Toast. No. 2.— I'ut iialf an ounce of butter in a fry- 
ing-pan ; when hoi, add gradually four ounces of mild cheese. 
Whisk it thoroughly until melted. Beat together half a jjint of cream 
and tw(j eggs ; whisk int(j the cheese, add a little salt, pcnir over the 
crisp toast, and serve. 

The two abo\e reci])es are usually called "Welsh Karebil."' 

Oyster Toast. — Select the large ones, used for frying, and 
iirst dij) iheni in beaten egg, then in either cracker or bread-cnmibs, 
and cook upon a line wire gridiron, over a cpiick fux'. Toast shoukl 
be made reatly in advance, and a rich cream sauce [joured over the 
whole. After pouring on the sauce, tinel)- cut celery strewn over the 
top adds to their delicacy. 

Or, wash oysters in the shell, and put them on hot coals, or upon 
the toj) of a hot stove, or bake them in a hot oven ; open the shells 
with an cnster-knife, taking care to lose none of the liquor. iJip the 
toast into hot, salted water quickly, and turn out the oyster and 
liquor over the toast ; season with salt antl pepper, antl a teaspoonfui 
of melted butter over each. 

Oysters steamed in the shell are equally as g(jod. 

Mushrooms on Toast. — I'eel a quart of mushrooms, and cut 
ofif a little of the vooi end. .Melt an t)unce of butter in the frying-pan, 
and fry in it half a jjound of raw minced steak ; add two saUspoonfuls 
of salt, a pinch of cayenne, and a gill of hot water ; fry until the 
juices are extracted from the meat : lilt the n;i!i nn-.! squeeze the meat 
with the back of the spoon until there is nothing left but dry meat, 
then remove it ; add the mushrooms to the liquid, and if there is not 
enough of it, add more butter ; toss them about a moment and pour 
out on hot toast.

Suggestions in regard to Cake Making Use none but

the l;cst material 

j)re|)are(l before commem in^ to mix any of them. E^^s beat uj} 
mucli lighter and sooner by being placed in a cold place some time 
before using them ; a small |)inch of soda sometimes has the s 
efTecl. Flour should always be sifted before 



imc 
of 



using It. Cream of 
tartar or baking jxnvder should be thoroughly mixetl with the flour ; 
butter be placed where it will Ijccoine moderately soft, but not melted 
in the least, or the cake will be sodden and heavy. Sugar should be 
rolled ;tnd sifted ; spices ground or pounded ; raisins or any other 
fruit lo(jked over and i)rei)arcd ; currants, especially, should be nicely 
washed, jiicked, dried in a (loth, and then carefully examined, that no 
pieces of grit or stone may be left aiiujngst them. ' Thev should then 
l)e laid on a dish befoie the fire to beccjme thoroughly dr\- ; as, if 
ailded d.imp to the other inj^rediints, cakes will be liable to be heavy. 
Eggs should l)e well-beaten, the whites and yolks separately, the 
yolks to a thick ':ream, the whites until they are ;'i stifT froth. Always 
stir the butter and sugar to a cream, then add the beaten yolks, then 
the milk, the flavouring, then the beaten whites, and lastly the flour. 
If fruit is to be used, measure antl dredge with a little sifted flour, 
stir in ;.'radually .and thoroughly. 

Four all in well-buttered cake-pans. While the cake is baking, 
care should be taken that no cold air enters the oven, only when 
necessary to see that the cake is baking [iroperly ; the oven should be 
an even, moderate heat, not too cold or too hot ; much depends on 
this for success. 

Cake is often sjioiled from being looked at too often when first put 
into the oven. 'I'he heat should be tested before the cake is i)ut in, 
which can be done by throwing on the floor of the oven a tablespoon- 
ful of new flour. If the flour t.ikes fire, or assumes a dark-brown 
colour, tlu^ temperature is too high, and the o\en must be allowed 
cool ; if the flour remains white after the lapse of a few seconds, the 
temper.iture is too low. When the oven is of the proper temperature, 
the flour will slightly brown and look slightly scorched. 

Another gootl wa\- to test the heat, is to drop a few spoonfuls of the 
(-ake-balter on a small piece of buttered letter-paper, and place it in the 
oven dming the finishing of tlie cake, so that the piece will be baked 
before putting in the whole cake ; if the little drop of cake-batter bakes 
e\enly withou' Inuiiing around the edge, it will be safe to put the 
whole cake in the oven. Then again if the oven seems too hot, fold a 
thick brown paper double, and lay on the bottom of the oven ; then 
after the cake has risen, i)ut a thick brown paper over the top, or 
butter well a thick white paper and lay carefully over the fop. 

If, after the cake is put in, it seems to bake too fast, put a brown 
paper loosely over the top of the pan, care being taken that it does 
not touch the cake, and do not open the door for five minutes at 
least ; the cake should then be quickly examined, and the door shut

V.n dry o\ stiff before the last coat is needed, it can be thinned 
suiTk ientiy with a little water, enough to make it work smoothly. 

A little Icinon-juice, or half a teaspoonful of tartaric acid, added to 
tl'.c frosting while being beaten, makes it white and more frothy. 

The flavours mostly used are lemon, vanilla, almond, rose, chocolate, 
and orange. If you wish to ornament with figures or flowers, make 
up rather more icing, keep about one-third out until that on the cake 
is dried ; then, with a clean, glass syringe, apply in such forms as you 
(Ifsire and dry as before; what you keep out to ornament with may 
be tinted pink with cochineal, blue with indigo, yellow with saffron or 
the grated rind of an orange strained through a cloth, green with 
spinach juice, and brown with chocolate, purple with cochineal and 
indigo. Strawberry, or currant and cranberry juices colour a delicate 
pink. 

Set the cake in a cool oven with the door open, to dry, or in a 
draught in an open window. 

Almond Frosting. — The whiles of three eggs, beaten up with 
three cui)s of line, wl;ite sugar. lUanch a pound of sweet aimonds, 
pcjund them in a mortar wiin a little sugar, until a fine paste, then add 
the whites of eggs, sugar and vanilla extract. Found a few minutes 
to thoroughly mix. Cover the cake with a very thick coating of this, 
set in a cool oven to dry, afterwards cover with a plain icing. 

Chocolate Frosting. — The whites of four eggs, three cups of 
powdered sugar, and nearly a cup of grated chocolate. Beat the 
whites a very little, they must not become white ; stir in the chocolate, 
then put in the sugar gradually, beating to mix it well. 

Plain Chocolate Icing. — Put into a shallow i)an four table- 
spoonfuls of scraped chocolate, and place it where it will melt 
gradually, but not scorch ; when melted, stir in three tablespoonfuls of 
milk or cream, and one of water ; mix all well together, and add one 
scant teacupful of sugar ; boil about five minutes, and while hot, and 
when the cakes are nearly cold, spread some evenly over the surface 
of one of the cakes ; put a second one on top, alternating the mixture 
and cakes ; then cover top and sides, and set in a warm oven to 
harden. All who have tried recipe after recipe, vainly hoping to find 
one where the chocolate sticks to the cake and not to the fingers, will 
appreciate the above. In making those most palatable of cakes, 
"chocolate Eclairs," the recipe just given will be found very satis- 
factory. 

Tutti Frutti Icing. — Mix with boiled icing one ounce each 
of chopped citron, candied cherries, seedless raisins, candied pine- 
apple, and blanched almonds. 

Sugar Icing. — To one pound of extra refined sugar, add one 
ounce of fine white starch ; pound finely together, and then sift them 
through gauze ; then beat the whites of three eggs to a froth. The 
secret of success is to beat the eggs long enough, and always one way ; 
add the powdered sugar by degrees, or it will spoil the froth of the 
eggs. When all the sugar is stirred in, continue the whipping for 
half an hour longer, adding more sugar if the ice is too thin. Take 
a little of the icing and lay it aside for ornamenting after>vard. When

ounces of I)itter almonds, renewing the hot water when expedient ; 
when the skins are all off, wash the almonds in cold water (mixing 
the sweet and bitter), and wipe them drv ; pound them to a fine 
smooth paste (one at a time), adding, as you proceed, water or white 
of egg to prevent their boiling. Set them in a cool place; beat ten 
eggs, the whites and yolks sei)arately, till very smo )th and thick, and 
then beat into t.iem gradually two cups powdered sugar in turn with 
the pounded almonds ; lastly add the flour, stirring it round slowly 
and lightly on the surface of the mixture, as in ctMiimon sponge-cake ; 
have ready buttered a deep square pan ; ])ut the mixture carefully intt) 
It, set into the oven, and bake till thoroughly done and risen very 
high ; when cool, cover it with plain white icing flavoured with rose- 
water or with aluKjnd icing. With sweet almonds, alwavs use a small 
portion of bitter ; withcjut them, sweet almonds have little or no taste, 
though they add to the richness of the cake. 

Use two heaping tea-spoonfuls of baking-powder in the flour. 

Old-Fash ioned Sponge Cake— Two cups of sifted white 

sugar, two cui)s of flour measured before sifting, ten eggs. Stir the 

yolks and sugar together until perfectiv light dd a pinch of salt ; 

beat the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth, and add them with 

the flour, after beatmg together lightly ; flavour with lemon. Bake 

in a moderate oven about forty-five minutes. Baking-powder is an 

improvement to this cake, using two large teaspoonfuls.

sweetened and whipped to a stiff froth, also tiav(jvred. Spread it 
over the cake while fresh. To whip the cream easily, set it on ice 
before whi])])in,_;. 

Rolled Jelly Cake.— Three eggs, one teacup of tine sugar, 
one teacup of tlour ; beat the yolks until light, then add the sugar, 
then add two tablespoonfuls of water, a [)inch of salt; lastly stir in 
the tlour, in which there should be a heaping teaspo(jnful of baking- 
powder. The tlour added ;^i-,Hiually. bake m long, shalli.iu biscuit 
tin.s, well-greased. Turn out on a damp towel on a bread-board, and 
cover the to]) with ]>'\h\ and roll up while warm. 

To cut Layer Cake. — When < mting Layer-cakes, it is better 
to first make a round hole in the cake, with a knife or tin tube, about 
an inch and a quarter in diametre. This prevents the edge of the 
cake from crumbling when cutting it. 

When making custard filling for Layer-Cake, always set the dish 
containing the custard in another dish of boilini.; water over the 
tire ; this ])revents its burning, which won d d< -troy its flavour. 

Layer Jelly Cake.--.\!niost any soW cake recipe can be 
used for jelly-( ake. The f(.illowing is excellent : One cup of sugar, 
half a cup of butter, three eggs, half a cu]) of sweet milk, two cups of 
tlour, two heaping teaspoonfuls of bakinj^-pouder, tlavouring. 

For white, delicate cake, the rule for "Silver Cake ' is tine; care 
should be taken, however, that the oven i-^ just riglu for this (ake, as 
it brown-, very easily. 'I"o be baked m jelly cake tins, in layers, with 
filling put between when done. 

Any of the following cake-fiHing recipes may be used with these

pour on a cupful of boiling water ; stir into this two tablespoonfuls of 
sifted flour, rubbed snio(jth in half a cup of water ; then add a table- 
spoonful of melted butter ; cook until it thickens. When cold, spread 
between the layers of cake. Oranges can be used in place of lemons. 
Another filling of lemon (without cooking) is made of the grated rind 
and juice of two lemons, and the whites of two eggs beaten with one 
cu]5 (jf sugar. 

No. 12. Orange Cake filling.— l'eel two large oranges, 
remove the seeds, chop them tine, and half a peeled lemon, one cup

stiff fr(nh, adding half of a cupful of sugar ; then mix thoroughly into 
this the whole of the chopped ingredients. Put it between the layers 
cake when the cake is hot, so that it will cook the egg a little. This 
will be found delicious. 

Custard or Cream Cake. — Cream together two cups of sugar 
and half a cup of butter ; add half a cup of sweet milk in which is dis- 
solved half a teaspoonful of soda. beat the whites of six eggs to a 
stiff froth, and add to the mixture. Have one heaping teaspoonful 
of cream of tartar stirred thoroughly into three cups of sifted fiour, and 
add quickly. Bake in a moderate oven, in layers like jelly-cake, and 
when done, spread custard between. 

For the custard. — Take two cups of sweet milk, put it into a clean 
suitp'ile dish, set it in a dish of boiling water on the range or stove. 
When the milk comes to a boil, add two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch 
or flour stirred into half a cup of sugar, adding the yolks of four eggs, 
and a little cold milk. Stir this into the boiling milk, and when 
cooked thick enough, set aside to cool ; afterwards add the flavour-

Hard Gingerbread. — Made the same as 'Soft (.mgerbread, 
omitting the ei^KS ''in'l mixing hard enough to roll out like biscuit; 
rolled nearly half an inch thick, anil <:ui out like smal'. biscuits, or -t 
can be baked m a sheet or on a biscuit-tin ; cut slits a quarter of an 
inch deep across the top of the tin from side to side. When baked 
and while hot, rub over the top with molasses, and 'et it dry on. 

These two above recipes are the best 1 have ever found among a 
hirge variety that I have tried, the ingredients giving the best pro- 
portion for flavour ami excellence. 

Plain Gingerbread.— One cup of dark cooking molasses, one 
cup of sour cream, one egK, on teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a

luittercd patix-pan tins, and bake in a very moderate oven. A 
Ijakcr's vn \]n-. 

Baker's Ginger Snaps. — Hoil all together the following in- 
gredients : '! wo < ujjs of blown sugar, two cups of rooking molasso, 
one cup of shortening, which should be part butter, one large tabli- 
sjjoonful of ginger, one tables|)oonful of ground cinnamon, one tea- 
sjxionful of ( loves ; remove from the tire and let it cool. In the meantime, 
sift four cups of flour anfl stir part of it into the above mixture. Ntns 
(liss(jlvc a teaspoonful of soda in a teaspoonful of warm water and beat 
into this mixture, stir in the remainder (jf the Hour, and make stiff 
enough to roll into long rolls alK)ut one inch in diameter, and cut off 
from the end into half-inch pieces. Place them on well-buttered 

tins, giving plenty of room to s])read. Hake in a moderate oven. 
Let them tool before taking out (jf the tins. 

Ginger Cookies. — One ( u]) sugar, one cup molasses, one cup 
butter, one egg, one tablespoonful vinegar, one tal)les])oonful ginger, 
one teas|)oonful soda, dissolved in l)oiiing writer, mix like cookey 
dough, rather soft. 

Ginger Snaps. — One cup brown sugar, two < ups molasses, one 
large cup l)utler, two teaspoonfuis soda, two teaspoonfuls ginger, 
three pints doui to commence with ; rub shortening and sugar 
together into the flour; add enough i.iore flour to roll very smooth, 
very thin, and bake in a quick o'en. The dough can be kept for 
days by putting it in the flour-barr(-l under the Hour, and bake a few 
at a time. The more tlour that ;an be worked in and the smoother 
they can be rolled, the better and more Irittle they will be. Should 
be rolled out to wafer-like thinness. Hake quickly without burning. 
They should become perfectly cold before putting aside. 

Dominoes.-— Have a plain cake baked in rather thin sheets, and 
cut into small oblong pieces the size and shape of a domino, a 
trifle larger. Frost the top and sides. When the frosting is hard, 
draw the black lines and make the dots, \\ith a small brush dipped 
in melted chocolate. These are very nice for children's parties. 

Fancy Cakes. — These delicious little fancy cakes may be made 
by making a rich jumble-paste — rolling out in any desired shape ; 
cut some paste in thick, narrow strips and lay around your cakes, so 
as to form a deep, cup-like edge ; place on a well-buttered tin and 
bake. When done, fill with iced fruit, prepared as follows : Take 
rich, ripe peaches (canned ones will do, if fine and well-drained from 
all juice), cut in halves ; plums, strawberries, pineapples cut in 
stjuares, or small triangles, or any other available fruit, and dip in 
the white of an e^i; that has been very slightly beated and then in 
pulveri/.ed sugar, and lay in the centre of the cakes. 

Wafers. — Dissolve four ounces of butter in half a teacup of milk ; 
stir together four ounces of white sugar, eight of sifted flour, and the 
\olk of one egg, adding gradually the butter and milk, a table- 
spoonful of orange-flower water, and a pinch of salt ; mix it well. 
Heat the wafer-irons, butter their inner surfaces, put in a tablespoonful

<)t" the batter, and close the irons iinincdiatcly ; put the irons over the 
thv, and turn tht-m (occasionally, initil the wafer is cooked ; wlicn the 
wafers are all cooked, roll them on a small round stick, stand them 
upon a sieve, and dry them ; serve with ices. 

Peach Cakes.— 'i'ake the yolks and whiles of live cgj^s and 
heat t!icm se|)aratcly the whites to a stiff froth;. Then mix the 
beaten • (jlks with half a pound of pulverized and sifteii loaf or 
< rushed su.i^ar, and beat the two to^'ether thoroughly. Fifteen 
minutes will be none too lon„^ for the latter operation if you wouhl 
have excellence with your ( akes. 

Now add half a pound of lint .. .ur, dredgin- it in a little at a time, 
and then put in the whites of the eggs, beating the whole together 
for four or ti\e minutes. Then with a large spoon, drop the batter 
upon a baking -tin, which has been Inittered and tloured, being care- 
ful to have the cakes as nearly the same size as possible, and 
resembling in shape the half of a peach. Have a cpiick oven ready, 
and bake the (akes about ten minutes, wat( liing them closely so that 
they may onl\ (oine to a ligiu l)r()un colour. Then take them out, 
si)read the t1at side of each with peach jam, and stick them together 
;n p.iirs, covering' the outside with a thin coat of ii ing, which" when 
diy (an be lir, shed over on one side of the cake, with a little 
( (ichine.il water. 

Cup Cakes.— 'I'wo cups of sugar, one cup of butter, (jne cup of 
milk, three ( ups and a half of flour, and four eggs, half a teaspoonful 
of s(xla, large spoon cream of tartar ; stir butter and sugar together, 
and add the beaten yolks of the eggs, then the milk, then flavouring, 
and the whites. Put cream of tartar in flour and add last. Hake in 
buttered gem-pans, or drop the batter, a teasp(jonful at a time, m 
ri.ws, on flat buttered tins. 

To this recipe iiiay be added a cup of English currants or chopped 
raisins ; and also an(Jther variety of cakes may be made bv adding a 
half cup of citron sliced and floured, a half-cupful of chopped almonds, 
and lemon extract. 

Variegated Cakes — One cup powdered sugar, one half cup 
of butter creamed with the sugar, one-half cup of milk, four eggs, the 
whites only, whipped light, two and one-half cups of prepared flour. 
Hitter almond flavouring, spinach juice and cochineal. Cream, the 
butter and sugar ; add the milk, flavouring, the whites and flour. 
Divide the batter into three parts. Bruise and pound a few leaves of 
spinach in a thin muslin bag until you can express the juice. Put a 
few drops (jf this into one portion of the batter, colour another with 
cochineal, leaving the third white. Put a little of each into small, 
round pans or cups, giving a light stir to each colour as you add the 
next. This will vein the cakes prettily. Put the white between the 
puik and green, that the tints may show better. If you can get 
pistachio nuts to pound up fur the green, the cakes will be much 
nicer. Ice on sides and top. 

Corn Starch Cakes — One cupful each of butter and 
sweet milk, and half a cup of corn-starch, two cupfuls each of sugar 
and flour, the whites of five eggs beaten to a stiff froth, two tea-

su^;ar ; stir into tln-^ one lieapin^ ( offee-ciip »ii tloiir, in which one 
teaspoonfiil of cream of tartar and half a teaspoonful of saleratiis arc

washed butter, and droj) in teas])oonfuls about tlirce inclies apart. 
I'ake instantly in a very (juick oven. Watih cl<jsely as they will

Savory Biscuits or Lady Finders.— I'ut nine ta))le- 
spooiifuU of tine white suj^ar into a bowl, and i)ut the bowl into hot 
water to heat the su^ar ; when the sugar is thorouj^hly heated, 
break nine eggs into the bowl anil beat them ([uickly until thev 
become a little warm and rather thick ; then take the bowl from the 
water, and continue beating until it is nearly or quite cold ; now stir 
in lightly nine tablespoonfuls of sifted tlour ; then wit' a paper- 
funnel, or something of the kind, lay this mi.xture out upon jiapers, in 
biscuits three inches long and h.alf an inch thick, in the form of 
fingers ; sift sugar o\er tlie biscuits, and bake them upon tins to a 
light brown ; when they are done and cold, remove them from the 
papers, by wetting them on the back : dry them, and they arc 
ready for use. They arc often used in making Charlotte Russe. 

Pastry Sandwiches. — I'uff-paste, jam of any kind, the white 
of an egg, sifted sugar. 

Roll the paste out thin ; |jut half of it on a baking-sheet or tin, 
and spread equally over it apricot, greengage, or any preserve that 
may be ])referred. Lay cner this preserve another thin jiaste, press 
the edges together all round, and mark the i)aste in lines with a 
kniie on the surface, to show where to cut it when baked. Bake 
from twenty minutes to half an hour ; and, a short time before being 
done, take the pastry out of the oven, brush it over with the white of 
an egg, sift over pounded sugar, and put it back in the oven to 
colour. When cold, cut it into strips ; pile these on a dish pyra- 
midically, and serve. 

This may be made of jelly-cake dough, md, after baking, allowed 
to cool before spreading with the preserve ; either way is good, as 
well as fanciful. 

Neapolitaines. — One cup of powdered sugar, half a cup of 
butter, two lal)!espoonfuIs of lemon-juice, three whole eggs, and three 
yolks, beaten separately ; three cups of sifted tlour. Put this all 
together with half a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a tablespoonfui 
of milk. If it is toostift' to roll out, add just enough more milk. Roll 
it out a quarter of an inch thick, and cut it out with any tin cutter. 
Place the cakes in a pan slightly greased, and colour the tops with 
beaten egg and milk, with some chopped almonds over them. 
Hake in a rather cjuick oven. 

Brunswick Jelly Cakes. — Stir one cup of powdered white 
sugar, and one half cup of butter together, till perfectly light ; beat 
the yolks of three eggs till very thick and smooth ; sift three cups of

Raised Doughnuts.— Old fashioned "raised doughnuts" arc 
seldom >eeii, nou-a-da\s, Init are easily made. Make a sponge a*; ft»r 
bread, using a pint of warm water or milk, and a large half cupful of 
yeast ; when the sponge is very light, add half a cupful of butter or 
sweet lard, a coffee-cupful of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt and one 
small tcasp(jonful of sotla, di-^solved in a little water, one tablespoonful 
of cinnamon, a little grated nutmeg ; stir in now two well-beaten eggs, 
add sifted tlour until it is the consistency of bi.scuit tlough, knead it 
well, cover and let rise ; then roll the dough out into a sheet h;df an ■ 
inch thick, cut out with a very small biscuit-cutter, or in strips half an 
inch wide and three inches long, place them on greased tins, cover 
th.em well, and let them rise before frying them. Drop them in very 
hot lard. Raised cakes retpiire longer time than takes made with 
baking-])owiler. Sift powderetl sugar o\er tlieni a-i fast as they are

that, however, i^ a matter of taste. 

Baker's Raised Doughnuts.— Warm eacupful of lard in a 
pint of milk; when nearly cool, add enough jui to n)ake a thick 
I)atter, and add a small cupful of yeast ; beat it well, and set it to 
rise ; when light, work in radually and carefully three cupfuls of 
sugar, the whipped sol ^i,\ eggs, half a teaspoonful of sotla, dis- 

solved in a spoonf;. . milk ; one teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of 
ground cinnann ;. .md half of a nutmeg grated ; then work in

and when very light, roll it out in a -.hcet an inch thick ; ( ut into 
rounds ; put into the centre of each round a large Sultana raisin, 
seeded, and mould into perfectly round balls ; flatten a iittle ; let 
them stand a few minutes before boiling them ; have plenty of lard in

like pie-crust ; cut in squares three inches long and two wide, then 
cut several slits or lines lengthwise, to within a quarter of an inch of 
the edges of the ends ; run your two forefingers through every other 
sht ; lay them down on the board edgewise, and dent them. These 
arc very dainty when fried. Fry in hot lard a light brown. 

German Doughnuts — One pint of milk, four eggs, one small 
tabIes]K)onful of melted butler, flavouring, salt to taste ; first boil the 
milk and pour it, while hot, over a pint of flour ; beat it very smooth, 
and when it is cool, have ready the yolks of the eggs well beaten ; 
add them to the milk and flour, beaten well into it, then add the well- 
beaten whites, then lastly add the salt and as much more flour as 
will make the whole into a soft doi gh ; flour your board, turn your 
dough upon it, roll it in pieces as thick as your finger and turn them 
in the form of a ring ; cook in plenty of boiling lard. A nice break- 
fast cake with coffee. 

Nut Cakes (Fried).— Beat two eggs well, add to them one 
ounce of sifted sugar, two ounces of warmed butter, two tablespoonfuls 
of yeast, a teacupful of lukewarm milk and a little salt. Whip all 
well together, then stir in by degrees one pound of flour, and, if 
requisite, more milk, making thin dough. IJeat it until it falls from 
the spoon, then set it to rise. When it has risen, make butter or lard 
hot in a frying-pan ; cut from the light dough little pieces the size of 
a walnut, and without molding or kneading, fry them pale brown. 
As they are done, lay them on a napkin to absorb any of the fat. 

Trifle Cakes.— Work one egg and a tablespoonful of sugar 
to as much flour as will make a stiff paste ; roll it as thin as a penny- 
piece, and cut it into small round or scjuare cakes ; drop two or three 
at a time into the boiling lard ; when they rise to the surface and turn 
over they are done ; take them out with a skimmer and lay them on 
an inverted sieve to drain. When served for dessert or supper, put a 
spoonful of jelly on each. 

Pufl^ Bail Doughnuts.— These doughnuts, eaten fresh and 
warm, are a delicious breakfast dish, and are quickly made. Three 
eggs, one cupful of sugar, a pink of sweet milk, salt, nutmeg, and flour 
enough to permit the spoon to stand upright in the mixture ; add two 
heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder to the flour ; beat all until 
very light. Drop by the dessertspoonful into boiling lard. These 
will not absorb a bit of fat, and are not at all rich, and consequently 
are the least injurious of this kind of cakes.

CHAPTER XX I. X. 

PASTRY, PIES, AND TARTS. 

General Remarks.— Use the very best materials in makin"* 
pastry ; tlie shortening should be fresh, sweet, and hard ; the wate° 
cold (ice water is best), the paste rolled on a cold board, and all 
handled as little as possible. 

When the crust is made, it makes it much more flakey and puff 
much more to put it in a dish covered with a cloth, and set in a very 



PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS 



237 



cold place for half an hour, or even an hour ; in summer, it could be 
placed in the ice box. 

A great improvement is made in pie-crust by the addition of about 
a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder to a ([uart of flour, also 
brushing the paste as often as roiled out, and the pieces of butter 
placed thereon, with the white of an eg^i;, assists it to rise in leaves or 
flakes. As this is the great beauty of puff-paste, it is as well to try 
this method. 

If currants are to be used in pies, they should be carefully picked 
over, and washed in several waters, dried in a towel, and dredged 
with flour Ijefore they are suitable for use. 

Raisins, and all dried fruits for pies and cakes, should be seeded, 
stoned, and dredged with flour, before using. 

Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water upon them, 
and then slipping the skin off with the fingers. In pounding them, 
always add a little rose or orange water, with fine sugar, to prevent 
their becoming oily. 

Great care is requisite in heating an oven for baking pastry. If 
you can hold your hand in the heated oven while you count twentv, 
the oven has just tlie proper temperature, and it should be kept at 
this temperature as long as the pastry is in ; this heat will bake to a 
light brown, and will give the pastry a fresh and flakey appearance. 
If you suffer the heat to abate, the under crust will become heavy and 
clammy, and the upper crust will fall in. 

Another good way to ascertain when the oven is heated to the 
proper degree for puff-paste : put a small piece of the paste in previous 
to baking the whole, and then the heat can thus be judged of. 

Pie-crust can be kept a week, and the last be better than the first, 
if put in a tightly covered dish, and set in the ice-chest in summer, 
and in a cool place in winter, and thus you can make a fresh pie 
every day with little trouble. 

In baking custard, pumkin or squash pies, it is well, in order that 
the mixture may not be absorbed by the paste, to first partly bake the 
paste before adding it, and when stewed fruit is used the filling should 
be perfectly < ool when put in, or it will make the bottom crust sodden. 

How to make a Pie. — After making the crust, take a portion 
of it, roll it out and fit it to a buttered pie-plate by cutting it off 
evenly around the edge ; gather up the scaps left from cutting and 
make into another sheet for the top crust ; roll it a little thinner than 
the under crust ; lap one half over the other and cut three or four 
slits about a quarter of an inch from the folded edge, (this prevents 
the steam from escaping through the rim of the pie, and causing the 
juices to run out from the edges). Now fill your pie-plate with your 
prepared filling, wet the top edge of the rim, lay the upper crust 
across the centre of the pie, turn back th(^ lialf that is lapped over, 
seal the two edges together by slightly pressing down with your thumb, 
then notch evenly and regularly with a three-tined fork, dipping 
occasionally in flour, to prevent sticking. Bake in a rather quick 
oven a light brown, and until the filling boils up through the slits in 
the upper crust.

'i^ 



To prevent the juice soakinj; through into the crust, making it 
-'*<'KRy> "'^t the upper crust witii the white of an egg, just before you 
put in the pic mixture. If the toj) of tlie pie is Ijrushed over with 
tlie egg, it gives it a beautiful ghize. 

For Icing Pastry.— To ice pastry, which is tlie usual method 
adopted for fruit tarts and sweet dishes of jiastry, put the white of an 
ei;g ()i> a |)late, and witii the blade of a knife beat it to a stiff froth. 
When the pastry is nearly baked, brush it over with this, and sift over 
some pounded sugar ; jiut it I)ack into the oven to set the glaze, and 
in a few minutes it v.ill l)e done. (ireat care should l)e taken that 
the paste does not catch or burn in the oven, which it is very liable 
to do after the icing is laid on. 

Or make a meringue by adding a tablespoonful of white sugar to 
tlie beaten white (jf one egg. Spread over the top, and slightly 
l)rown in the oven. 

Fine Puff Paste. — Into one quart of sifted flour, mix two 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, and a teaspoonful of salt : then sift 
again. .Measure out one teacupful of butter and one of lard, hard 
and cold. Take the lard and ruli into the tlour until a very fine, 
smooth paste. Then put in just enough ice-water, say half a cupful 
containing a beaten wliite of egg, to mix a very stiff" dough. Roll it 
out into a thin sheet, spread with one-fourth of the l^utter, sprinkle 
over with a little flour, then roll up closely in a long roll, like a scroll, 
double the ends towards the centre, flatten and reroll, then spread 
again with another quarter of the butter. Repeat this operation till the 
butter is used up. Put it on an earthen dish, cover it with a cloth 
and set it in a cold place, in the ice-box in summer ; let it remain 
until cold ; an hour or more before making out the crust. Tarts 
made with this paste cannot be cut with a knife when fresh ; they go 
into flakes at the touch. 

You may roll this pastry in any direction, from you, towards you, 
sideways, anyway, it matters not, but you must have nice flour, 
ice-water, and very little of it, and strength to roll it, if you would 
succeed. 

Puff Paste for Pies. — One quart of pastry flour, one pint 
of butter, one tablespoonful of salt, one of sugar, one and a quarter 
cupfuls of ice-water. Wash the hands with soap and water, and dip 
them first in \-cry hot, and then in cold water. Rinse a large bowl or 
l)an with boiling water, and then with cold. Half fill it with cold 
water. Wash the butter in this, working it with the hands until it is 
light and waxy. This frees it from the salt and buttermilk, and 
lightens it, so that the pastry is more delicate. Shape the butter into 
two thin cakes, and put in a pan of ice-water to harden. Mix the 
salt and sugar with the flour. With the hands, rub one-third of the 
butter into the flour. Add the water, stirring with a knife. Stir 
c|uickly and vigorously, until the paste is a smooth ball. Sprinkle 
the board lightly with flour. Turn the paste on this and pound 
quickly and lightly with the rolling-pin. Do not break the paste. 
Roll from you, and to one side ; or, if easier to roll from you all the 
time, turn the paste around. When it is about one-fourth of an inch

thick, wipe the remaining butter, break it in bits, and spread these on 
the paste. Sprinkle lightly with flour. Fold the paste, one-third 
from each side, so that the edges meet. Now fold from the ends, 
but do not have these meet. Double the paste, pound lightly, and 
roll down to about one-third of an inch in thickness. Fold as I'lefore, 
and roll down again. Repeat this three times, if for i)ics, and six 
times if for 7'(>/-n/r-7u'fi/s, patties, tarts, etc. Place on the ice, to 
harden, when it has been rolled the last time. It should be in the 
ice-chest at least an hour before being used. In hot weather, if the 
paste sticks when being rolled down, put it on a tin sheet, and place 
on ice. .As soon as it is chilled, it will roll easily. The less flour 
you use in rolling out the paste, the tenderer it w'ill be. No matter 
how carefully every part of the work may be done, the paste will not 
be good if much flour is used. 

^ Soyers Recipe for PufF-Paste.— To every pound of 
flour allow the yolk of one egg, the juice of one lemon, half a salt- 
spoonful of salt, cold water, one pound of fresh butter. 

Put the flour on to the paste-board ; make a hole in the centre, 
into which put the yolk of the egg, the lemon -juice, and salt ; mix 
the whole with cold water (this should be iced in summer, if conveni- 
ent) into a soft, flexible paste with the right Iiand, and handle it as 
little as possible ; then squeeze all the buttermilk from the butter, 
wring it in a cloth, and roll out the paste ; place the butter on this, 
and fold the edges of the paste over, so as to hide it ; roll it out again 
to the thickness of a (juarter of an inch ; fold over one-third, over 
which again pass the rolling-pin ; then fold over tlie other third, thus 
forming a square ; place it with the ends, top, and bottom before you, 
shaking a little flour both under and over, and repeat the rolls and 
turns ^■^■^ again, as before. Flour a baking sheet, put the paste on 
this. 'ot it remain on ice or in some cool place for half an hour; 

the ■ i .wice more, turning it as before ; place it again upon the ice 
for a quarter of an hour, give it two more rolls, making seven in all, 
and it is ready for use when required. 

Rule for Under Crust.— A good rule forpie-crust for a pie 
requiring only an under crust,— as a custard or pumpkin pie,— is : 
Three large tablespoonfuls of flour sifted ; rubbing into it a large 
tablespoonful of cold butter, or part butter and '^irt lard, and a pinch 
of salt, mixing with cold water enough to form a smooth, stiff paste, 
and rolled ijuite thin. 

Plain Pie-crust — Two and a halfcupfuls of sifted flour, one 
cupful of shortening, half butter and half lard, cold ; a pinch of salt, 
a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, sifted through the flour. 
Rub thoroughly the shortening into the flour. Mix together with half 
a teacupful of cold water, or enough to form a rather stiff dough ; mix 
as litlie .1:1 pusslblc, just enough to get it into shape to roll out ; it 
must be handled very lightly. This rule is for two pies. 

When you have a little pie-crust left do not throw it away ; roll it 
thin, cut it in small scjuares and bake. Just before tea, put a spoon- 
ful of raspberry jelly on each square. 

Puff-paste or Suet.— Two cupfuls of flour, one-half teaspoon- 



■! it '■ 



-K 



L.il 



240 



PASTRY, I'lES AND TARTS 



ful of salt, one teaspoonful of IjakiriK^-powcler, one cup of chopped 
suet, freed of skin, and chopped very fine, one cupful of water. Place 
the flour, sifted with the powder, in a bowl, add suet and water ; mix 
into smooth, rather firm douyh. 

This paste is e\( client for fruit puddings, and dunijjlinKS that are 
boiled ; if it is well ma e, it will be light and flaky, and the suet im- 
perceptible. It is also excellent for meat pies, baked or boiled. All 
the ingredietits should be very cold when mixing, and the suet dredged 
with flour after it is chopped, to prevent the particles from adhering to 
each other. 

Potato Crust. — Boil and mash a dozen medium-sized jiotatoes, 
add one good teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of cold butter, 
and half a cupful of milk or cream. Stiffen with flour sufficient to roll 
out. Nice fir the tops of meat pies. 

To make Pie-crust Flaky.— In making a pie, after you 
have rolled out your top crust, cut it about the right size, spread it 
over with, butter, then shake sifted flour over the butter, enough to 
cover it well. Cut a slit in the middle, place it over the top of your 
pie, and fasten the edges as any pie. Now take the pie on your left 
hand, and a <\\ppcv of cold water in your right hand ; tip the pie 
slanting a little, pour over the water sufficiently to rinse ofif the flour. 
Enough flour will stick to the butter to fry into the crust, to give it a 
fine, blistered, flaky lo(jk, which many cooks think is much better than 
rolling tlic !)utter into the crust. 

Tartlets.— Tarts (jf strawberry or any other kind of preserves 
are generally made of the trinmiings of pufl-pastc rolled a little thicker 
than for ordinary pies ; then cut out with a round cutter, first dipped 
in hot water, to make the edges smooth, and placed in small tart-pans, 
first |)ricking a icw holes at the bottom with a fork before placing them 
in the oven. Bake from ten to fifteen minutes. Let the paste cool a 
little ; then fill it with preserve. By this manner both the flavour and 
colour of the jam are preserved, which would be lost were it baked in 
the oven on the paste ; and besides, so much jam is not required. 

Patties, or Shells for Tarts.— Roll out a nice puff-paste 
thin ; cut out with a glass or cookey-cutter, and with a wine-glass or 
smaller cutter, cut out the centre of two out of three ; lay the rings 
thus made on the third, and bake at once. May be used for veal or 
oyster patties, or filled with jelly, jam or preserves, as tarts. Or shells 
may be made be made by lining patty-pans with paste. If the paste 
is light, the shells will be fine. Filled with jelly and covered with 
nieringue (tablespoonful of sugar to the white of one egg), and browned 
in oven, they are very nice to serve for tea. 

If the cutters are dipped in hot water, the edges of the tartlets will 
rise much higher and smoother when baking. 

Tartlets. — I'artlets are nice made in this manner : Rnl! some 
good puff-paste out thin, and cut it into two and a half inch squares ; 
brush each square over with the white of an egg, then fold down the 
corners, so that they all meet in the middle of each piece of paste ; 
slightly press the two pieces together, brush them over with the egg, 
sift over sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for about a quarter of 



PASTRY, TIES AND TARTS 



241 



an hour. When they are done, make a little hole in the middle of 
the paste, and till it up with apricot jam, marmalade, or red currant 
jelly. Pile them hi^h in the centre of a dish, on a napkin, and garnish 
with the same preserve the tartlets are filled with. 

Tarts. — Larger pans are required for tarts proper, the size of 
small shallow pie-tins ; then after the paste is baked and cooled and 
filled with the jam or preserve, a few stars or leaves are placed on the 
toj-, or strips of paste, criss-crossed on the top, all of which have been 
previously baked on a tin by themselves. 

Dried fruit, stewed until thick, makes fine tart pies, also cianberries, 
stewed and well sweetened. 

Green Apple Pie. — Peel, core and slice tart apples enough for 
a pie ; sjjrinkle over about three tablespoonfuls of sugar, a tcaspoonful 
of cinnamon, a small level tablespoonful uf sifted tlour, two table- 
spoonfuls of water, a few bits of liutter ; stir all together with a spoon ; 
put it into a pie-tin lined with pie-paste ; cover with a top-crust and 
l)ake about forty minutes. 

The result will be a delicious, juicy pie. 

Apple Custard Pie. No. 1. — Three cupfuls of milk, four 
eggs, and one cupful of sugar, two cupfuls of thick stewed apples,

Remove it from the fire, and when cooled, pour it into a deep pie-tin, 
lined with pastry ; bake, and when done, have ready the whites, 
beaten stift', with three small tables[)oonfuIs of sugar. Spread this 
over the top and return to the oven to set and brown slightly. This 
makes ;i tleej), large-si/cd pie, and very superior. 

Lemon Pie. No 2. — One coftee-cupful of sugar, three 
eggs, <jne cu])ful of water, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one 
heai)ing tablespoonful uf flour, the juice and a little of the rind of one 
lemon. Reserve the whites of tiie eggs, and after the pie is baked, 
spread them over the top, beaten lightly, with a spoonful of sugar, and 
return to the o\en until it is a light brown. 

This may be cooked before it is jnit into the crust or not, but it is 
rather better to cook it first in a iloul)le boiler or dish. It makes a 
medium-sized ])ie. Hake from tliirty-fne to forty minutes. 

Lemon Pie. No. 3. — Moisten a heaping tablespoonful of 
corn-starch with a little cold water, then add a cupful of boiling 
water ; stir over the fire till it boils and cuok the corn-starch, say two 
or three minutes ; add a teaspoonful of butter, and a cupful of sugar ; 
take off the fire, and when slightly cooled, add an egg well beaten, 
and the juice and grated rind of a fresh lemon. Bake with a crust. 
This makes one small pie. 

Lemon Pie. No. 4. — Two large, fresh lemons, grate 
off the rind, if not bitt'-^ reserve it for the filling of the pie ; pare off 
every bit of the white skin of the IcuKjn, 'as it t<jughens while cook- 
ing) ; then cut the iemon into very thin slices with a sharp knife, and 
take oat the seeds ; two cupfuls of sugar, three tablcspoonfuls of water, 
and two of sifted tlour. Put into the pie a layer of lemon, then one of 
sugar, then one of the grated rind, and, lastly, of flour, and so on till 
the ingredients are used ; sprinkle the water over all, and cover with 
upper crust. He sure to have the under crust lap over the upper, and 
pinch it well, as the syrup will cook all out if care is not taken when 
finishing the tdge of crust. This quantity makes or:; medium-sized 
pie. 

Orange Pie. — Cirate the rind of one and use th juice of two 
large oranges. Stir together a large cupful of sugar and a heaping 
tablespoonful of flour ; add to this the well-beaten yolks of three eggs, 
two tablespoonfals of melted butter. Reserve the whites for frosting. 
Turn this into a pie-pan lined with pie-paste, and bake in a quick 
oven. When done so as to resemble a finely baked custard, spread 
on the top of it the beaten whites, which must be sweetened with two 
tablcspoonfuls of sugar ; spread evenly, and return to the oven and 
brown slightly. 

The addition of the juice of half a lemon improves it, if convenient 
to have it. 

Baker's Custard Pie. — Beat up the yolks of three 
eggs to ? cream. Stir thoroughly a tablespoonful of sifted flour into 
three taoiespoonfuls of sugar ; this separates the particles of flour so 
that there will be no lumps ; then add it to the beaten yolks, put in 
a pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of vanilla, and a little grated nutmeg ;

This is one of the best of pies, if made correctly, and the cherries in 
any case should be stoned. 

Currant Pie. No. 1. — Make in just the same way as the 
Cherry Pie, unless they are somewhat green, then they should be 
stewed a little. 

Ripe Currant Pie. No. 2. — One cupful of mashed ripe 
currants, one of sugar, two tablcspoonfuls of water, one of tlour, beaten 
with the yolks of two eggs. Hake ; frost the t(jp with the beaten 
whites (jf the eggs and two tablcspoonfuls powdered sugar, and brown 
in oven. 

Green Tomato Pie. — Take medium-sized tomatoes, pare, and 
cut'(jut the stem end. Having your pie-pan lined with paste made as 
biscuit dough, slic 1 the tomatoes very thin, filling the pan somewhat 
heaping, then graie over it a nutmeg, put in half a cup of butter, and 
a medium cup of sugar, if the pan is rather deep. Sprinkle a small 
handful of flour over all, pouring in half a cup of vinegar before add- 
ing the top crust. Bake half an hour, in a moderately hot oven, 
serving hot. Is good ; try it. 

Apricot iVIeringue Pie. — A canned apricot meringue pie is 
made by cutting the apricots tine and mi.\ing them with a half cup of 
sugar and the beaten yolk of an egg ; fill the crust and bake. Take 
from the oven, let it stand for two or three minutes, cover with a 
meringue made of the beaten white of an egg and one tablespoonful 
of sugar. Set back in a slow oven until it turns a golden brown. 
The above pie can be made into a tart without tlse addition of the 
meringue by adding criss-cross strips of pastry when the pie is first 
put into the oven. 

All of the above are good if made from the dried and stewed 
apricots instead of the canned, and are much cheaper. 

Stewed dried apricots are a delicious addition to mince-meat. 
They may be use in connection with minced apples, or to the exclu- 
sion of the latter. 

Blaclcberry Pie. — Put a quart of picked blackberries into a 
basin of water ; take off whatever floats ; take up the berries by the 
handful, pick out all the stems and unripe berries, and put them into 
a dish ; line a buttered pie-dish with a pie-paste, put in the berries 
half an inch deep, and to a quart of berries, put half of a teacupful 
of brown sugar ; dredge a teaspoonful of flour over, strew a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and a little nutmeg grated over; cover the pie, 
cut a slit in the centre, or make several small incisions on either 
side of it ; press the two crusts together around the edge, trim it 
off neady with a sharp knife, and bake in a quick oven for three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Blackberry Pie. — Pick the berries clean, rinse them in cold 
water, and finish as directed for other berries. 

iVIoiasses Pie. — Two teacupfuls of molasses, one of sugar, 
three eggs, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one lemon, nutmeg ; 
beat and bake in pastry. 

Lemon Raisin Pie. — One cup oi chopped raisins, seeded, the 
juice and grated rind of one lemon, one cupful of cold water, one

tahlospoonful of flour, one cupful of suKar, two tablcspoonfuls of butler. 
Stir li^litly to-(;tlier and bake with upper and under crust. 

Rhubarb Pie.— Cut the lar^e stalks off where the leaves com- 
mence, stii|» off the outside skin, ilicn cut the ;,ialks in pieces half an 
inch louK ; hne a pie-dish with paste rolled rather thicker than a five 
shilluiK piece, put a layer of the rhubarb nearly an ini h deep ; to a (|uart 
bowl of cut rhubarb put a lar^e tcacupful of su>^ar ; strew it over with 
a saltspoontul of salt and a little nutmeg arMcd ; shake over a little 
flour; cover with a rich pie-crust, cut a slit in the centre, trim off the 
edye with a sharj) knife, and bake in a ipiick oven until the pie loosens 
from the di .h. Rhubarb pies made in this wav are altoKethcr superior 
to thosi; made of the fruit stewed. 

Rhubarb Pic, Cooked.— Skin the stalks, < ut them into small 
pieces, wabh, and put them in a stewpan with no more water than 
what adheres to them ; when cooked, ma^^h them fine, and put in a 
.«mall piece of butter ; when cool, sweeten to taste ; if liked aild a 
httle lemon-peel, cinnamon or nutmey ; line your plate with thin crust, 
put in the filling, cover with crust, and bake in a c|ui( k oven ; sift 
.sugar over it w hen served. 

Pineapple Pie.— A -rated |)ineapple ; its weight in sugar ; half 
Its weight m butler ; one cupful d cream ; five eggs ; beat the butter 
to a creamy froth; add the sugar and yolks of the eggs, continue 
beating till very li-ht ; add the cream, the pineapple grated, and the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff fiolh. Hake with an under crust 
Eat cold. - 

Grape Pie.— Pop the i)uli)s out of the skins into one dish, and 
|)ut the skins mio another. Then simmer the pulp a little over the 
fire to soften it ; remove it ami rub it through a c(jlan'.lcr to separate 
It from the seeds. Then put the skins and jjulp together, and they 
are ready for pies or for canning or putting in jugs for further use. 
Fine for pies. 

Damson or Plum Pie — Stew the damsons whole in water only 
sulticicnt to prevent their burning ; when tender, and while hot, 
sweeten them with sugar, and let them stand until they become cold ; 
then i)our them into pie-dishes lined with paste, dredge flour upon' 
them, cover them with the same paste ; wet and pinch together the 
edges of the i^aste, cut a sli' in the centre of the cover through which 
the vapour may escape, and bake twenty minutes. 

Peach Pie.— I'eel, stone, and slice the peaches. Line a pie-plate 
with crust, and lay in your fruit, sprinkling sugar liberally over them 
m proportion to their sweetness. Allow three peach kernels, chopped 
fme, to each pie ; pour in a very little water, and bake with an upper 
crust, or with cross-bars of paste across the top. 

Dried Fruit Pies.— Wash the fruit thoroughly, soak over 
night in water enough to cover. In the morning, stew slowly ■.mti! 
nearly done, in the same water. Sweeten to taste. The crus't^ both 
upper and under, should be rolled thin ; a thick crust to a fruit pie 
IS undesirable.

ful f)f sifted flour, (if very juicy), and as much sugar as is necessary to 
sweeten sufficiently. Now till up the crust to the top, making quite 
full. Cover with crust, and bake ab(Hit forty minutes. 

Blackberry i)ies are im|)roved by putting into them a little ginger 
and cinnamon. 

Jelly and Preserved Fruit Pies. — Preserved fruit re- 
quires no baking, ; hence, always bake the shell, and put in the 
sweetmeats afterwards ; you can cover with whipped cream, or bake a 
top crust shell ; lln' former is preferable for delicacy. 

Cranberry Pie. — Take tine, sound, ripe cranberries, and with a 
sharp knife si)lit each one until you have a heaping coffee-cupful ; 
put them in ;i vegetable dish or basin ; put over them one cup of 
white sugar, half a cup of water, a tablespoonful of sifted tlour ; stir 
it all together and put into your crust. Cover with ;in upper crust 
anil bake slowly in a moderate oven. You will find this the true way 
of making a cranberry i)ie. 

Cranberry Tart Pie. — .\fter having washed and picked over 
the berries, stew them well in a little w.iter, just enough to cover 
them ; when they burst open, and become soft, sweeten them with 
plenty of sugar, mash them smijoth (some i)refer them not mashed); 
line your pic-|)lates with thin puff paste, till them, and lay strips of 
paste across the top. Bake in a moderate oven. ( )r you may rub 
tlu-m tlirough a < olander to free them from the skins. 

Gooseberry Pie. — Can be madn the same as Cranberry Tart 
Pie, or an u|)per crust can be put on before baking. Serve with 
boiled custard, or a pitcher of good, sweet rream. 

Stewed Pumpkin or Squash for Pies. — Deep-coloured 
pumpkins are generally the best. Cut a pumpkin or squash in half, 
take out the seeds, then cut it up in thick slices, pare the outside and 
cut again in ^lUiall pieces. But it into a large pot or saucepan, with 
a very little water ; let it cook slowly until tender. Now set tl.e pot 
on the back of the stove, where it will not bum, and cook slowly, 
stirring often until the moisture is dried out and the pumpkin looks 
dark and red. It niiuires cooking a long time, at least half a day, to 
ha\e it dry and ricii. When cool Mress through a .:(jl.inder. 

Baked Pumpkin or Sq^iash for Pies. — Cut up in 
several pieces, do not pare it ; place them on baking-tins and set them 
in the oven ; bake slowly until soft, then take them out, scrape all 
the i)umkin from the shell, rub it through a colander. It will be fine 
and light and free from lumps. 

Pumpkin Pie. No. 1. — For three pies; One quart of milk, 
three cujjfuls of boiled <uid strained pumpkin, one and one-lialf cup- 
fuls of sugar, one-half cupful of molasses, the yolks and whites of four 
eggs beaten separately, a little salt, one ta!)lespoonful each of ginger 
and cinnamon. i»eat all together and bake with an under crust. 

Marrow or squash may be substituted for pumpkin, and are much 
preferred by many, as possessing a less strong flavour. 

Pumpkin Pie. No. 2. — One quart of stewed pumkin, pressed 
through a sieve ; nine eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately ; two 
scant quarts of milk, one teaspoonful of mace, one teaspoonful oi

o\en. In the meantime, put the white of the eggs in a bright copper 
vessel and beat thoroughly, using a l)aker"s wire c-g-beater for this 
purpose. While beating, sjjrinkle in lightly half a pound of sugar and 
a dash of salt. When the paste is c|uite firm, spread a thin layer of 
it over the tart and decorate the top with the remainder by

Thf usual rule for custards is, eight eggs to a quart of milk ; but a 
very, good custard can be made of six, or even' less, especia ly w th 
the addition of a level tablespoonful of sifted flour, thoroughly blende 
m the sugar first, before adding the other ingredil^nts. Thev may be 
baked, boiled or steamed, either in cups or one large diTh U 
improves custards to first boil the milk and then cool it before beinJ 
used ; also a httle salt adds to the flavour. A very .mall umnof 
butter may also be added, if one wants something espe ' ic7 

To make custards look and taste better, duck's eggs should be 
used when obtainable ; they add very much to the flavour and rich- 
ness, and so many are not required as of ordinary eggs, four duck's 
eggs to the pint of milk making a delicious custard. When desired 
extremely rich ancl good, cream should be substituted for the m fk 
aijd^ double the quantity of eggs used to those mentioned, omittmg Ihe 

When making boiled custard, set the dish containing the custard 
mto anotlier and larger dish, partly filled with boiling water pi , H

slow oven. If made with nicety, it is the most delicate of all sweets ; 
if cooked till it wheys, it is hardly eatable. 

Frozen eggs can be made quite as good as fresh ones if used as 
soon as thawed soft. Drop them into boiling water, letting them 
remain until the water is cold. They will be soft all through and 
beat up equal to those that have not been touched with the frost. 

Eggs should always be thoroughly well-licaten, separately, the 
yolks first, then the sugar added, beat again, then add the beaten 
whites with the flavouring, then the cooled scalded milk. The 
lighter the eggs are beaten, the thicker and richer the custard. 

Eggs should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks 
separated, and they should always be strained. Breaking the eggs 
thus, the l)ad ones may lie dsily rejected without spoiling the others, 
and so cause no waste. 

A meringue, or frosting for the top, rec[uires about a tablespoonful 
of fine sugar to the beaten \vhite of one egg ; to be placed on the top 
after the custard or pudding is baked ; smoothed over with a broad- 
bladed knife dipped in cold v/ater, and replaced in the oven to brown 
slightly. 

Soft Caramel Custard. — One quart of milk, half a cupful of 
sugar, six eggs, half a te;i.spoonful of salt. Put the milk on to boil, 
reserving a cupful. Beat the eggs and add the cold milk to them. 
Stir the sugar in a small frying-pan until it becomes liquid and just 
begins to smoke. Stir it into the boiling milk ; then add the beaten 
eggs and cold milk, and stir constantly until the mixture begins to 
thicken. Set away to cool. Serve in glasses. 

Baked Custari. — Beat five fresh eggs, the whites and yolks 
separately, the yolks with half a cup of sugar, the whites to a stiff 
froth ; then stir them gradually into a quart of sweet, rich milk, 
previously boiled and cooled ; flavour with extract of lemon or 
vanilla, and half a teaspoonful of salt. Rub butter over the bottom 
and sides of a baking-dish or tin basin ; pour in thf custard, grate a 
little nutmeg over, and bake in a quick oven. It l-c'ter to set the 
dish in a shallow pan of hot water, reaching nea.iy to the top, the 
water to be kept boiling until the custard is baked ; three-quarters of 
an hour is generally enough. Run a teaspoon handle into the middle 
of it ; if it comes out clean it is baked sufficiently. 

Cup Custard. — Six eggs, half a cupful of sugar, one quart of 
new milk. Beat the eggs, and the sugar and milk, and any extract 
or flavouring you like. Full your custard cups, sift a little nutmeg or 
cinnamon over the tops, set their, in a moderate oven in a shallow 
pan half filled with hot water. In about twenty minutes try them 
with the handle of a teaspoon to see if they are firm. Judgment and 
great care are needed to attain skill in baking custard ; for if left in 
the oven a minute too Ion.;, or if the fire is too hot, the milk will 
certainly whey. 

Serve cold, with fresh fruit sugared and placed on top of each. 
Strawberries, peaches or raspberries, as preferred. 

Boiled Custard. — Beat seven eggs very light, omitting the 
whites of two ; mix them gradually, with a quart of milk and half a

two c^iiH that remain, adding' two hcapin.^ tabic poonfuls of sugar.

ice for some hours before using. 

Apple Custard. — Pare, core and cpiarter a dozen large juicy 
pippins. Stew anu)ng them the yellow peel of a large lemon grated 
very fine ; and stew them till tender in a very smrdl portion of water. 
When done, mash them smootli with the back of a spoon (you must 
have a pint and a half of the stewed apple) ; mix a half cupful of 
su^ar with them, and set them away till cold, lieat six eggs very 
hght, and stir them gradually into a quart of rich milk, alternately 
with the stewed apple. I'ut the mixture into cups, or into a deep dish

cold place. 

In the meantime, make a boiled custard of the yolks of three of 
the -^iggs, with half of a cujiful of sugar, and a pint of milk ; flavour

hitter almond or grated lemon i)eel ; lay the snow thus formeil 
c|uickly in rocky heajjs on silver or glass dishes, or in shajjes. Iced, 
it will turn out well.

next day.

the beaten whiles of three eggs. Stand the dibh in the oven, until 
the eggs have become a delicate brown, then remove, and, when 
cool enough, set the dish on ice, or in a very cool i)lace. Take the 
yolks of the eggs, add to them a pint of milk, sweeten and flavour,

through and clear ; then t.ike them out, slice into the syrup one large 
lemon, and add an ounce of gelatine dissolved in a pint of cold 
water. Let the whole mix well and come to a boil ; then pour upon 
the apples. The syrup will congeal. It is to be eaten cold with 
cream. 

Or you may change the dish by making a soft custard with the 
yolks of four eggs, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and a scant 
quart of milk. When cold, spread it over the apples. Whip the 
whites of the eggs, flavour with lemon, and place on the custard. 
Colour in the oven.

butter the size of a nutmeg. Now add half a cupful of cold milk and

the boiling milk, remove to top of the stove and let simmer a minute 
or two. When the cream is cold pour over the cake just before 
setting it on the table. Serve in saucers. If you do not have plenty 
of eggs you can use all corn-starch, about two heaping teaspoonfuls ;

lumps.

Leamington Pie. — This recije is the same as " Cream 
Pie," (adding half an ounce of butter,) .vhich may be found under the 
head of " Pastry, Pies and Tarts." In summer time, it is a good plan 
to bake the pie the day before wanted ; then when cool, wrap around

prepare cream by whipping, sweetening and adding flavour of vanilla, 
if desired ; put layers of peaches between the sheets of cake ; pour 
cream over each layer and over the top. To be eaten soon after it is 
prepared. 

Fruit Short-cakes.— For the recipes of strawberry, peach 
and other fruit siiort-cak'-s, look under the head of " Biscuits, Rolls 
and Muffins." They all make a very delicious dessert when served 
with a pitcher of fresli, sweet cream, when ol)tainal)le. 

Salted or Roasted Almonds.— IManch half a pound of 
almonds. Put with them a tablespcionful of melted butter and one of 
salt. Stir them till well mixed, then spre.id them over a baking-pan 
and bake fifteen minutes, or till crisp, stirring often. They must be 
bright yellow-brown when done. They are a fashionable appetizer, 
and should be placed in ornamental dishes at the beginning of dinner, 
and are u^^ed by some in place of olives, which, however, should also 
be on the table, or some fine pic kles may take their place. 

Roast Chestnuts. — I'eel the raw chestnuts and scald them to 
remove the inner skin ; put them in a frying-pan with a little butter 
and toss them about a few moments ; add a sprii.kle of salt and a 
suspicion of cayenne. Serve them after the cheese. 
Peanuts may l)e blanched and roasted the same. 
After-Di nner Croutons. — These crispy croutons answer as 
a substitute for hard-water crackers, and are also relished by most 
pcojile. 

Cut sandwich-bread into slices one-quarter of an inch thick ; cut 
each slice into four small triangles ; dry them in the oven slowly 
until they assume a delicate brownish tint, then serve, either hot or 
cold. A nice way to serve them is to spread a paste of part butter 
and part rich, creamy cheese, to which may be added a very little 
minced parsley. 

Orange Float.— To make orange float, take one quart of 
water, the juice and pulp of two lemons, one coffee-cupful of sugar. 
•When boiling hot, add four tablespoonfuls of corn-starch. Let it 
boil fifteen minutes, stirring all the time. When cold pour it over 
four or five oranges that have l)een sliced into a glass dish, and over 
the top spread the beaten whites of three eggs, sweetened and 
flavoured with vanilla. A nice dessert. 

Lemon Toast.—This dessert can be made very conveniently 
without much preparation.

sufificient melted butter, hot, to fry a delicate brown. Take the 
whites of the six eggs, and beat them to a froth, adding a large cupful 
of white sugar ; add the juice of two lemons, heating weii,and addmg 
two 1 upfuls of boiling water. Serve over the toast as a sauce, and 
YOU will find it a verv delirious dish. 

Sweet Omelet. No. 1.— One tablespoonful of butter, two of 




268 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS, ETC. 




suf,'ar, one cupful of milk, four ej,'gs. Let the milk come to a boil, 
lieat the flour and butter to^^^cther ; add to them Kradually the boiling 
milk, and cook eight minutes, stirring often ; beat the sugar and the 
yolks of the eggs together ; add to the cooked mixture, and set away 
to cool. When cool, beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and 
add to the mixture. Hake in a buttered pudding-dish for twenty 
minutes in a moderate oven. Serve immedi.uely, with creamy 
sauce. 

Sweet Omelet. No. 2.— P'our eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, a pinch of salt, half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract, one cupful 
of whipped < ream. lU.at the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and 
gradually beat the flavouring and sugar into them. When well 
beaten add the yolks, and lastly, the whipped croain. Have a dish 
holding about one quart slightly buttered. I'our the mixture into this 
and bake just twelve minutes. Serve the moment it is taken from 
the oven. 

Salad or Mixed Fruits.— Put in the centre of a dish a pine- 
apple properly pared, cored and sliceo, yet retaining as near as 
practicable its original shai)e. I'eel, (|uarler and remove the seeds 
from four sweet oranges ; arrange them in a border around the pine- 
apple. Select four fine bananas, peel and cut into slices lengthwise ; 
arrange these zig/ag-fence fashion around the border of the dish. In 
the V-shaped spaces around the dish put tiny mounds of grapes of 
mixed colours. When comi)lete, the dish should look very appetizing. 
To half a pint of clear sugar syrup add half an ounce of good cider, 
pour over the fruit and serve. 

Orange Cocoanut Salad.— I'eel and slice a dozen oranges, 
grate a cocoanut, and slice a pineajjple. Put alternate lavers of each 
until the dish is full. Then pour over them sweetened cider. Served 
with small cakes. 

When oranges are served whole, they should be peeled and prettily 
arranged in a fruit dish. A small knife is best for this purpose. 
Break the skin from the stern into six or eight even parts, peel each 
section down half way, and tuck the point in next to the orange. 

Crystallizec: Fruit.— Pick out the tinest of any kind of fruit, 
leave on then- stalks, beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, lay 
the fruit in the beaten egg with the stalks upward, drain them and 
Iieat the part that drips ofif again ; select them out, one by one, and 
dip them into ;i cup of (inely powdered sugar ; cover a pan with a 
sheet of fine paper, place the fruit inside of it, and put it in an oven 
that is cooling ; when the icing on the fruit becomes firm, pile them 
on a dish and set them in a cool place. For this purpose, oranges or 
lemons should be carefully pared, and all the while inner skin re- 
moveil that is possible, to prevent bitterness ; then cut either in thin 
horizontal slices if lemons, or in quarters if oranges. For cherries, 
str.'iwberries, currants, etc., choose the liir^est .infl finest leavin'-' ^tcms 
out. Peaches should be pared and < ut in halves, and sweet juicy 
pears may be treated in the same way, or look nicely when pared, 
leavmg on the stems, and iced. Pineapples should be cut in thin 
slices, and these, again, divided into quarters.

sugar, the uhites ..f >ix eg^;s ; whisk the whites of the eggs 
to a stiff froth, and with a woo.len spo.m stir in qmckly 
the pounded sugar; and have some b.uirds put in the oven 
thick enough t.) prevent the bottom of the meringues from acciuinng 
too much I olour. Cut some strips of paper about two inches wide ; 
pl.-.ce this paper on the l)oard and drop a tablespoonful at a time of 
the mixture on the i)aper, taking care to let all the meringues be the 
same si/e In droi)i)mg it from the spoon, give the mixture the fonn 
of an egg, and keep the meringues about two inches ajiart from each 
other .>n'the paper. Sir.iw o\ er them some sifted sugar, and bake in a 
m.ulerate oven for half an hour. As soon as they begin to colour, 
remove them from the oven ; take each slip of paper by the two ends, 
and turn ii gentlv on the table, and, with a small spoon take out the 
soft part of each meringue. Spread some clean paper on the board, 
turn the merinv;p.es upsi.le down, and put them into the oven to 
harden anil brown on the other side. When reciuired for table, hll 
them with whipi)ed cream, flavoured with vanilla, or other essence, 
an.l sweeten with pounded sugar. Join two of the meringues together, 
and pile them high in the dish. T.. vary their appearance, hnc-^y 
ch.iiiped almonds or currants may be strewn over them before the 
sugar is sprinkled over ; and they may be garnished with any bright-

sweet dish, as. if the meringues are not put into the oven as soon as 
the sugar and eugs are mixed, the former mclls, and tlie mixtiirc 
would run on the paper instead of keeping its egg-shape. The 
sweeter the meringues are made the crisper will they be ; but if there

tough. They are sometimes coloured with cochineal ; and, if kept

cold, remove every particle of fat, replace the jelly into the preservinK- 
kettle, and add one pound of loaf Si.ig«i, &i rind and juice of two 
lemons; when the sugar has di-'^ohed, beat two eggs with their 
shells in one gill of water, whici^ pou»- into the kettle, and boil five 
minutes, or until perfectly clear ; .ho.: add one gill of cider and 
strain throUj^h a flannel bag into any form you like. 

Lemon Jelly. No. 2.— To a packa^je of gelatine add a pint of 
cok! water, the juice of four lemons and the rind of one ; let it 
stand !>ne hour, then add one pint of boiiin^ walci, a pinch of cinna- 
mon, three cups of sugar; let it all come to a boil ; strain throujjh a 
napkin into moulds ; set away to get cold. Nice poured over sliced 
bananas and oranges. 

Older Jelly — One package of gelatine, one cupful of cold

water soaked together two hours ; add to tliis tliree cupfi.ls of sii^ar, 
the juice of thre(; k-mons and tl.e Kratod rind of one. N.nv p.,ur over 
this a (luart of hoilin^ water, and stir until dissolved, then add a 
pint of . i.lcr. Strain through a napkin, turn into moulds dipF)cd into 
cold water, and placed in the ice box for several hours. 

( )ne K'ood way to mould this jelly is K. pour some of it into the mould, 
harden it a little, put in a layer of strawberries or raspberries, or 
any fresh fruit in season, i.our in jelly to set them ; after they have 
set, another layer of jelly, then another .,f berries, and so hi! each 
mould, alternating' with jelly and berries. 

Orange Jelly.— OrauKe jelly is a great delicacy, and n(jt 
expensive. To make a large dish, get six oranges, two lemons, a 
two-ounce package of gelatine to soak in a pint of water, stpiee/e the 
orange-juice int<. a bowl, also the lemon juice, ami grate one of the 
lemon skins in with it. Put about two cupfuls of sugar with the gela- 
tine, then stir in the ..range-juice, and iiour over all three pints ot 
boiling water, stirring . onsiantly. When the gelatine is entirely dis- 
solved, strain through a napkin into moulds or bowls wet with cold 
water, and set aside to harden. In three or four hours it will be 
ready for use, and will last several days. , 

Varieeated Jelly.— After dividing a box of prepared gelatine 
into halves, put each half into a bowl with half a cupful of cold water. 
Put three-ciuartcrs of an ounce or six sheets of pink gelatine into a 
third bowl c(jntaining three-fourths of a cui)ful of cold water. Cover 
the bowls tokeei) out the dust, and set them away for two hours. 
At the end of that time, add a pint of boiling water, a cupful of sugar, 
half a pint of cider, and the luue of lemon to the pink gelatine, and 
after stirrin-' till the gelatine is dissolved, strain the luiuid through a 
napkin Treat one of the other portions of the gelatine in the 

same wav Heat together the volks of four eggs and half a cupful of 
sugar, and, after adding this mixture to the third i)roportion of gela- 
tine stir the new mixture into a pint and a thinl ot boiling milk, con- 
tained in a double boiler. Stir on the hie for three minutes, then 
strain through a line sieve, and flavour with a teaspoonful of v.anilla 
extract Place m .i deei) pan two moulds, each holding about three 
pint's, and surround ihem with ice and water. Pour into these moulds, 
in equal parts, the cider jelly which was made with the clear gelatine, 
and set it awav to harden. When it has become set, pour in the 
pink -elatine which should have been set away in a i)lace not cold 
enough to make it harden. After it has been transteried and has 
become haril. pour into the moulds the mixture of eggs, sugar and 
gelatine whuh should be in a liquid state. Set the moulds in an ice- 
chest for three or four hours. At serving time, dip them into tepid 
water to loosen the contents, and gently turn the jelly out upon flat 

dishes. , . u u .1 

The clear jelly may be made first and poured into moulds, then tlie 

iVink jellv, and finallv the egg, jelly. 

Strawberry Jelly.— Strawberries, pounded sugar ; to every 
pint of juice allow half a i)ackage of gelatine. 

Pickthe strawberries, put them into a pan, squeeze them well with

a wooden spoon, add sufficit-nt pounded suuar to sweeten them nircly, 
and let them remain for an hour, tliat tlie juice may be extracted; 
then ackl half a pint of water to every pint of juice. Strain the straw- 
berry jui( e and water ihrouKh a napkin ; measure it, and to every 
pmt allow half a package of gelatine, dissolved in a teacupful of 
water. Mix this with the juice ; put the jelly into a mould, and set the 
mould on ice. A little lemon juice added to the strawberry juice 
improves the flavour of the jelly, if the fruit is very ripe ; but it must 
be well siraintcl before it is put with the other ingrethents, or it will 
make tin- jelly iiiuddy. Delitious and beautiful. 

Recipe for Chee-: Custard — Kor three persons, 2 ounces 
of grated i)arinesan clu-je ; the whites of 3 eggs, beaten to a stiff 
froth ; a little pe|jper and salt and cayenne ; a little milk or cream to 
mi.\ ; bake for a tjuarter of an hour. 



CHAPTER XXXI. 
ICE-CREAM AND ICES. 

Ice-cream— One pint of milk, the yolks of two eggs, six 
oun( es (jf sugar, and one tablespoonful of < (jrn-starch. Scald, but do 
not boil. Then put the whites (jf the two eggs into a pint (if 'cream ; 
whip it. Mi\ the milk and cream, tlavcnir and freeze. One teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla (jr lemon is generally sufficient. 

The c|uantity, of course, can be increased to any amuunt desired, 
so long as the relative proportions of the different ingredients are 
observed. 

Pure Ice-cream.— (ienuine ice-cream is made of the pure 
sweet cream in this proportion : Two quarts of cream, one pound of 
sugar ; beat up, ilaxour and freeze. 

For family use, select one (jf the new patent freezers, as being more 
rapid and less laborious for small quantities than the old style turned 
entirely by hand. -Ml conditions being perfect, those with crank and 
revolving dashers eftect freezing in eight to fifteen minutes. 

Fruit Ice-cream.— To every pint of fruit-juice allow one 
pint of cream : sugar to taste. 

Let the fruit be well ripened ; pick it off the stalks, and put it into 
a large earthen pan. Stir it about with a wooden spoon, breaking it 
until it is well-mashed; then, with the back of the spoon, rub it 
through a hair-sieve. Sweeten it nicely with pounded sugar; whip 
the cream for a few minutes, add it to the fruit, and whisk tiie whole 
again for another five minutes. I'ut the mixture into the free/er and 
freeze. Raspberry, strawberry, currant, and all fruit ice-creams, are 
made in the same manner. .-\ little pounded sugar sprinkled o\er 
the fruit l/cforc it is mashed a,-,5i5ts Uj extract tlie juice. In winter 
when fresh fruit is not obtainable, a little jam may be substituted for 
it ; it should be melted and worked through a sieve before being 
added to the whipped cream ; and if the colour should not be good, 
a little prepared cochineal may be put m to improve its appearance!

CHAPTER XXXII. 

DUMPLINGS AND PUDDINGS. 

It depends as much upon the judgment of the cook as on the 
materials used to make a good pudding. Everything should be the 
best in the way of materials, and a proper attention to the rules, 
with some practice, will ensure success. -^ , ■, , , 

Puddings are either boiled, baked, or steamed ; if boiled, the 
materials should be well worked together, put into a thick cloth bag, 
previously dipped in hot water, wringing it slightly, and dredging the 
inside thickly with flour ; tie it firmly, allowing room for it to swell ; 
drop it into a keltic of boiling water, with a small plate or saucer in 
the bottom to keep it from sticking to the kettle. It should not 
cease boilin" one moment from the time it is put in until taken out, 
and the pot must l^e tightly covered, and the cover not removed 
except when necessary to add water from the boiling tea-kettle when 
the water is getting low. When done, dip immediately in cold water 
and turn out! This should be done just l)efore placing on the table. 

Or butter a tin pudding-mould or an earthen bowl ; close it tight 
so that water cannot penetrate : drop it into boiling water and boil 
steadily the required time. If a bowl is used it should be well 
buttered, and not quite fiiled with the pudding, allowing room for it 
to swell • then wet a cloth in hot water, slightly wringing it, then 
floured on the inner side, and tied over the bowl, meeting under the 

bottom. , 1- T •

must be done so carefully that the mould will not hit the side of the 
kettle, and it must not be allowed to stop boili:^j,' for an instant. 

1 latter should never stick to the knife when it is sent to the table ; 
it will do this both when a less tiian sufficient number of ej^gs is 
mixed with it and when it is not enouj^h cooked ; about four eggs to 
the half jiound (;f tlour will make it firm enough to cut smoothly. 

When baked or boiled puddini^s are sufficiently solid, turn them o"*- 
of the dish they wore baked in, bottom uppermo^.t, and strew over 
them finely sifted sugar. 

When pastry (jr baked puddings are not done through, and yet the 
outside is sutVu iently brown, cover them (>\er with a piece of white 
pajier until thoroughly cooked ; thi;; prevents them from getting 
burnt. 

To clean Currants. — I'ul their, in a sie\e or colander, and 
sprinkle them thickly with tlour ; rub them well until they are 
separated, and the tlour, grit and fine stems have ])assed through the 
strainer. Place the strainer and currants in a pan of water and 
wash thoroughly ; then lift the strainer and currants together, and 
change the water until it is clear. Dry the currants between clean 
towels. It hardens them to dry in an oven. 

To chop Suet. — Break or cut in small pieces, sprinkle with 
sifted flour, and clioj) in a cold place to keej) it from becoming sticky 
and soft. 

To stone Raisins.— Put them in a dish and pour boiling 
\vater over them ; cover and let them remain in it for ten minutes ; it 
will soften scj that by rubbing each raisin between the thumb and 
finger, the seeds will come out clean ; then they are ready for cutting 
or chopjiing if reciuircd. 

Apple DumplingfS. — Make a rich biscuit dough, the same 
as soda or baking-powder biscuit, only adding a little more shortening. 
Take a piece of dough out on the moulding-board, roll out almost as 
thin as ])ie-crust ; then cut into square pieces large enough to cover 
an apple. Put into the middle of each piece two apple halves that have 
been pared and cored ; sprinkle on a spoonful of sugar and a pinch 
of ground rinnamon, turn the ends of the dough over the apple, and 
laj) them tight. Lay the dumplings in a drijiping-pan well buttered, 
the smooth side upward. When the pans are filled, put a small piece 
of butter on the top of each, sprinkle over a large ' ful of sugar, 
turn in a cupful oT boiling water, then place in a ir ite oven for 
three-quarters of an hour. Baste with the liquor once while baking. 
Serve with pudding-sauce or cream and sugar. 

Boiled Apple Dumplings. — The saiPL- recipe as the above, 
with the exception that they are put into a small coarse cloth well- 
fioured after being dipped in hot wiUer. Each cloth to be tiea 
securely, but leaving room enough for the dumpling to swell. Put them 
in a pot of boiling water and boil three-quarters of an hour. Serve with 
sweet saiice. Peaches and other fruits used in the same manner. 

Boiled Rice Dumpling^s, Custard Soiuce.— Boil half a 
pound of rice ; d;ain and mash it modciiilely fine. Add to it two

with sugar and cream.

Qraham Pudding.— Mix well together one half a coffee-cupful 
of mohsses, one-quarter of a cupful of butter, one egg, one-half a cup- 
ful I 'k, one-half a teaspoonful of pure s(Kla, one and one-half cup- 
fuls o. t>^iod Graham flour, one small teacupful of raisins, spices to 
taste. Steam four hours, and serve with nice sweet sauce, or 
any sauce that may be preferred. This makes a showy as well as 
a light and wholesome ilessert, and has the merit of simplicity and 
cheapness. 

Banana Pudding. — Cut sponge cake in slices, and, in a glass 
dish, put alternately a layer of cake and a layer of bananas sliced. 
Make a soft custard, flavour with a little seasoning, and pour over it. 
Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and heap over the whole. 

Peaches cup up, left a few hours in sugar and then scalded, and 
added when cold to thick boiled custard, made rather sweet, are a 
delicious dessert. 

Dried Peach Pudding^.— Boil one pint of milk and while hot 
turn it over a pint of bread-crumbs. Stir into it a tablespoonful of 
butter, one pint of dried peaelies stewed soft. When all is cool, add 
two well-beaten ej^gs, half of a cupful of sugar and a pinch of salt ; 
flavour to taste. I'ut into a well-buttered pudding dish and bake 
half an hour. 

Suet Pudding, Plain. — One cupful of chopped suet, one cup- 
ful of milk, two eggs beaten, half a teaspoonful of salt, and enough 
flour to make a stiff batter, but thin enough to jiour from a spoon. 
Put into a bowl, cover with a cloth, and boil three hour. The same, 
made a little thinner, with a few raisins added, and baked in a well- 
greased dish is excellent. Two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder in the 
flour improves this pudding. Or if made with sour milk and soda it 
is equally as gootl. 

Suet Plum Pudding. — One cupful of suet, chopped fine, one 
cupful of cooking molasses, one cupful of milk, one cupful of raisins, 
three and one-half cui^fuls of flour, one egg, one teaspoonful of cloves, 
two of cinnamon, and one of nutmeg, a little salt, one teaspoonful of 
soda ; boil three hours in a pudding-mould set into a kettle of water. 
Eat with common sweet sauce. If sour milk is used in place of sweet, 
the pudding will be much lighter. 

Peach Cobbler. — Line a deep dish with rich thick crust ; pare 
and cut into halves or quarters some juicy, rather tart peaches ; put 
in sugar, spices and flavouring to taste ; stew it slightly, and put it in 
the lined dish : cover with thick crust of rich puff paste, and bake a 
rich brown ; when done, break up the top crust into small pieces, and 
stir it into the fruit ; serve hot or cold ; very palatable without sauce, 
but more so with plain, rich cream or cream sauce. Other fruits can 
be used in place of peaches. Currants are best made in this manner : 

Press the currants through a sieve to free it from pips ; to each pint 
of the pulp put two ounces of crumbed bread and four ounces of 
sugar ; bake with a rim of puff-paste ; serve with cream. White 
currants may be used instead of red. 

Hominy Pudding. — Two-thirds of a cupful of hominy, one 
and a half pints of milk, two eggs, one tablespoonful of butter, one

what remains on the col) with a knife. Add a pint and a half or one 
cpiart of milk, according to the yoimgness and juiciness of the corn. 
Add four eggs well beaten, a half tea* upful of ilour, a half teacupful 
of butter, a tablespoonful of sugar, and salt to taste. Pake in a well 
greased eantliern dish, in a hot oven, two hours. I'lace it on the 
table browned and smoking hot, eat it with j)lenty of fresh butter. 
This can be useil as a dessert, by serving a sweet sauce with it. If 
eaten |)lainly with butter, it answers as a side vegetable. 

Geneva Wafers. — Two eggs, three ounces of butter, three 
ounces of flour, three ounces of pounded sugar. Well whisk the eggs, 
put them into a basin, and stir to them the buter, whii h should be

mix all well together. Putter a baking-sheet, and drop on it a tea- 
spoonful of the mixture at a time, leaving a s])a<e between each.

roll them up like wafers, and put in a small wedge of bread or piece 
of w'ood, to keep them in shape. Return them to the oven until 
crisp. Pefore serving, remove the bread, put a spoonful of preserve

pretty and ornamental dish for the supper-table, and is very nice, and 
very easily maile.

it becomes smooth and (juitc thick. Turn it into a dish dial has been 
dipped in water. Make a sauce very sweet to ser\e with it. Maple 
molasses is fine with it. This pudding is much improved by adding 
canned berries or fresh ones just before taking from the btove. 

Minute Pudding. No. 2.— One quart of milk, salt, two eggs, 
about a pint of flour. lieat the eggs well ; add the flour and eroiigh

Jelly Puddings. — Two cupfuls of very fine, stale biscuit or 
bread-crumbs ; one cupful of rich milk — half cream, if you can get it ;

boiling water; one cupful of sweet jelly, jam or marmalade. Scald

Quick Pudding. — Soak and split some crai kers ; lay the sur- 
face over with raisins and citron ; put the halves together, tie them

Ready Pudding. — Make a batter of one cpiart of milk, and 
about one pound of flour ; add six eggs, the yolks and whites separ-

WHEATEN MEAL, GRAHAM MEAL, OAT 
MF AL, PLAIN RICE AND PLAIN HOMINY. 

Wh% it P'teal ar Hasty Puddini^.— Put two ([uarts of 
rtW dinner j»)t or stcwpan, cover it, and let it become 
I (J r tlie fire, thpn add a tablespoonful of salt, take off 
,;.it scum ill ll\e top, li.ivc swef't, fresh yellow or white corn- 
meat ; take a hamdful of the meal with the left hand, and a puddiny- 
stick in the ri>,djt, then with the stick, stir thr water arounti, and by 
degJC'^ let fall the iiifil ; when one handliu is exhausted, refill it ; 
£©Btinue to stir and adu' meal until it is as thick as you can stir 
f»»th> or until the stick will Uand in it ; stir it a little while longer ; 
let UiM /) .' be y< lUle ; when it is sufft" ";ntly cooked, which will be in 
half an ho ir, it will bul)ble or puff up ; turn it into a deep basin. 
This is eaten cold or hot, with milk or with butler, and syrup or 
sugar, or with meat and graxy, the same as potatoes or rice. 

Fried Wheaten Meal.— Make it like the above recipe, turn it 
into brcad-liiis, and when (old slice it, dipeach pie( e in flour ;ind fry it 
in lard and butter mixed in the frying-p.in, turning to brown well both 
sides. .Must be served hot. 

Qraham Meal. — Sift Graham meal slowly into boiling salted 
water, stirring briskly until thick as can be stirred with one hand ; 
serve with milk or cream and sugar, or butter and syrup. It will be 
improved by removing from the kettle to a pan, as soon as thoroughly 
mi.xed, and si' aming three or four hours. It may also be eaten cold, 
or sliced and iiitHl, like wheat me.'U. 

Plain Boiled Rice.— Take half or c|uarter of a pound of the 
best quality of rice ; wash it in a strainer, and put it in a saucepan, 
with a quart of clean water and a pinch of salt ; let it boil slowly till 
the water is all evaporated — see that it does not burn — then pour in a 
teacuj)ful of new milk ; stir carefully from the bottom of the saucepan, 
so that the upper grain may go under, but do not smash it ; close the 
lid on your saucepan carefully down, and set it on a cooler part of 
the fire, where it will not boil ; as soon as it has absorbed the added 
milk, ser\e it up with fresh new milk, adding fruit and sugar for 
those who like them. 

Another nice way to cook rice is to take one te.u upful of rice and 
one quart of milk, place in a steamer, and steam from two to three 
hours ; when nearly done, stir in a piece of butter as large as the yolk 
of an egg, and a pinch of salt. You can use sugar if you like. The 
difference in the time of cooking depends on your rice — the older the 
rice, he longer time it takes to cook. 

Cracked Wheat. — Soak the wheat over night in cold water, 
about a (|uart of water to a cup of wheat ; cook it as direct <; for oat- 
meal ; s!. )uld be thoroughly done. E iten with sugar and crtn'e 

Oatmeal Porridge. — Soak one cup of oatmeal iv; n q-., 
vater over night, boil half an hour in the morning, sakcd io taste. 
It is better to cook it in a dish set into a dish of boiling water. Serve 
with milk, or milk and sugar, or syrup.

Oatmoal Flakes. — This healthful oat preparation may be 
procurf<l iium Uv: loading grocers, and is prepared as follows : Put 
into a double saucepan or porcclain-lincd pan a (juart of boiling 
water, add a saltspoonful of salt, and when it is lioiling, add, or 
rather stir in gradually, three nuuces of tiakcs. K> : ;> stirring to 
prevent burning. Let it boil fr n fifteen to twen'. ■ " .utes, and 
ser\e with creani and sugar. 

Ordinary oa neal requires tw hours steady cooking to make it 
palatable and digestible. Wheaten grits and hominy, one hour, but a 
h.ilf hour longer cooking will not injure them, and makes them easier 
of digestion. Never be afraid ol - ooking ceical^ or preparations from 
cereals too long, no mailer what the directions on the j)aikage may be. 

Oatmeal Steamed. — To one le.K ipful oatme.d add a '|uartof 
cold water, a lLM-.puonlul of salt ; put in a steamer over a kettle t»f 
cold water, gradually heat and steam an hour and a half after it 
begins to rook. 

Hominy. — Hominy is a preparation of Indian corn, broken or 
ground, either large or small, and is an excellent breakfast dish in 
winter or summer. Wash the hominy thoroughly in one or two 
waters, then cover it with twice its ilcpth of told w.iter, and let it 
come to a boil slowly. If it be the large hominy, simmer six hours ; 
if the small hominy, simmer two hours. When the water evaporates, 
add hot water ; when done, it may be eaten with cream, or allowed 
to become cold and warmed up in the frying-pan, using a little butter 
to prevent burning.

of one orange and the juice of two ; stir until all the orange-iuice is 
absorbed ; grate nutmeg upon the sauce, and serve on a flat dish. 

Cold Cream Sauce.^ — -Stir to a cream one cupful of sugar 
half a cupful of butter, then add a cupful of sweet, thick, cold cream, 
flavour to taste. Stir well, and set it in a cool place. 

Cream Sauce Warm. — Heat a pint of cream slowly in a 
double boiler ; when nearly boiling, set it off from the fire, put into it 
half a cupful of sugar, a little nutmeg or vanilla extract ; stir it 
thoroughly, and add, when cool, the whites of two well-beaten eggs. 
Set it on the fire in a dish containing hot water to keep it warm until 
needed, stirring once or more. 

Caramel Sauce. — Place over the fire a saucepan ; when it 
begins to be hot, put into it four tablespoonfuls of white sugar, and 
one tablespoonful of water. Stir it continually for three or four 
minutes, until all the water evaporates ; then watch it carefully until 
it becomes a delicate brown colour. Have ready a pint of cold water 
and cup of sugar mixed with some flavouring ; turn it into the sauce- 
pan with the browned sugar, and let it simmer for ten minutes. 

A Good Plain Sauce. — A good sauce to go with plain fruit 
puddings is made by mixing one cupful of brown sugar, one cupful of 
best molasses, half a cupful of butter, one large teaspoonful of flour ; 
add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, half a nutmeg, grated, 
half a teaspoonful of cloves and cinnamon. When these are 
all stirred together, add a teacupful of boiling water ; stir it con- 
stantly, put into a saucepan and let it boil until clear ; then strain. 

Old Style Sauce. — One pint of sour cream, the juice and 
finely grated rind of a large lemon ; sugar to taste. Beat hard and 
long until the sauce is very light. This is delicious with cold " Brown 
Betty " — a form of cold farina, corn-starch, blanc-mange, and the 
like. 

Plain Cold, Hard Sauce. — Stir together one cupful of white 
sugar, and half a cupful of butler, until it is creamy and light ; add 
flavouring to taste. This is very nice, flavoured with the juice of 
raspberries or strawberries, or beat into it a cupful of ripe straw- 
berries or raspberries and the white of an egg, beaten stifT. 

Custard Sauce. — One cupful of sugar, two beaten eggs, one 
pint of milk, flavouring to taste. 

Heat the milk to boiling, add by degrees the beaten eggs and 
sugar, put in the flavouring, and set within a pan of boiling water, 
stir until it begins to thicken ; then take it off, and stir in gradually 
any seasoning wished ; set until wanted within a pan of boiling water.

Milk Sauce. No. 1. — Dissolve a tablespoonful of flour in cold 
milk ; see that it is free from lumps. Whisk an ounce of butter 
and a cupful (jf sugar to a cream, and add to it a pinch of salt. Mix 
together half a pint of milk, one egg, and the flour ; stir this into the 
better, and add a dash of nutmeg, or any flavour ; heat until near the 
boiling point, and serve. \'cry nice in place of cold cream. 

Milk or Cream Sauce. No. 2. — Cream or rich milk, simply 
sweetened with plenty of white sugar and flavoured, answers the 
purpose of sonic kinds of pudding, and can be made very quickly. 

Fruit Sauce. — Two thirds of a cupful of sugar, a pint of 
raspberries or strawberries, a tablespoonful of melted butter and a 
cupful of hot water. Boil all together slowly, removing the scum as 
fast as it rises : then strain through a sieve. This is very good 
served with dumplings or apple puddings. 

Jelly Sauce. — Melt two tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a 
cupful of jelly over the fire in a cupful of boiling water, adding also 
two tablespoonfuls of butter ; then stir into it a teaspoonful of corn- 
starch, dissolved in half a cupful of water, add it to the jelly, and let 
it come to a boil. Set it in a dish of hot water to keep it warm until 
time to sene ; stir occasionally. Any fruit jelly can be used. 

Coininon Sweet Sauce. — Intoapintofwaterstira paste made 
of a tablespoonful of corn-starch or flour (rubbed smooth with a little 
cold water) ; add a cupful of sugar and a tablespoonful of vinegar. 
Cook well for three minutes. Take from the fire and add a piece of 
butter as large as a small egg : when cool, flavour with a tablespoon- 
ful of vanilla or lemon extract. 

Syrup for Fruit Sauce. — An excellent syrup for fruit 
sauce is made of Morella cherries (red, sour cherries). For each 
pound of cherry juice, allow half a pound of sugar and six cherry 
kernels : seed the cherries and let them stand in a bowl over night ; 
in the moruing, press them through a fine cloth which has been 
dipped in boiling water ; weigh the juice, add the sugar, boil fifteen 
minutes, removing all the scum. Fill small bottles that are perfectly 
dry with the syrup ; when it is cold, cork the bottles tightly, seal them 
and keep thr-m in a cool place, standing upright. 
Most excellent to put into pudding sauces. 



CHAPTER XXXV. 

PRESERVED FRUITS, JAMS, JELLIES AND 

MARMALADES 

Fruit for preserving should be sound and free from all defects, 
using white sugar, and also that which is dry, which pioduces the 
nicest syrup ; dark sugar can be used by being clarified, which is 
done by dissolving two pounds of sugar in a pint of -ivarer ; actC> to it 
the white of an egg, and beat it well, put it into a preserving kettle on 
the fire, and stir with a wooden spoon. As soon as it begins to swell 
and boil up, throw in a little cold water ; let it boil up again, take it 
oflT, and remove the scum ; boil it again, throw in more cold water, 



304 



PRESERVED FRUITS, JAMS, ETC. 





and remove the scum ; repeat until it is clear and pours like oil from 
the spoon. 

In the old way of preserving, we used pound for pound, when they 
were kept in stone jars or crocks ; now, as most preserves are put up 
in sealed jars or cans, less sugar seems sufficient ; three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar is generally all that is required for a pound of 
fruit. 

Fruit should be boiled in a procelain-lined or granite-ware dish, if 
possible ; but other utensils, copper or metal, if made bright and 
clean, answer as well. 

Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be con- 
verted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup, and 
then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven, adding to them 
a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will gradually penetrate the 
fruit, while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate. They 
should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and turned every six 
or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every 
time they are turned. Aftei .>. ards, they are to be kept in a dry 
situation, in drawers or boxes. Currants and cherries preser\-ed 
whole in this manner, in bunches, are extremely elegant, and have a 
fine flavour. In this way it is, also, that orange and lemon chips are 
preserved. 

Mould can be prevented from forming on fruit jellies by pouring a 
little melted paraffin over tlie top. When cool, it will harden to a 
solid cake, which can be easily removed when the jelly is used, and 
saved to use over again another year. It is perfectly harmless and 
tasteless. 

Large glass tumblers are the best for keeping jellies, much better 
than large vessels, for by being opened frequently they soon spoil ; a 
paper should be cut to fit, and placed over the jelly ; then put on the 
lid or cover, with thick paper rubbed over on the inside with the white 
of an c\;g. 

There cannot be too much care taken in selecting fruit for jellies, 
for if the fruit is over ripe, any amount of time in boiling will never 
make it jelly, — there is where so many fail in making good jelly ; and 
another important matter is overlooked — that of carefully skimming 
off the juice after it begins to boil and a scum rises from the bottom 
to the top ; the juice should not be stirred, but the scum carefully 
taken off: if allowed to boil under, the jelly will not be clear. 

When either preserves or canned fruits show any indications of 
fermentation, they should be immediately reboiled with more sugar, 
to save them. It is much better to be generous with the sugar at first, 
than to have any losses afterwards. Keep all preserves in a cool, 
dry closet. 

Preserved Cherries.— Take large, ripe Morella cherries ; 
weigh them, and to each pound allow a pound of loaf sugar. Stone 
the cherries, (opening them with a sharp quill,) and save the juice 
that comes from them in the process. As you stone them, throw them 
into a large pan or tureen, and strew about half the sugar over them, 
and let them lie in it an hour or two after they are all stoned. Then

put them into a preserving-kettle with the remainder of the sugar, 
and boil and skim them till the fruit is clear and the syrup thick. 

Preserved Cranberries. — The cranljerrics must be large and 
ripe. Wash them, and to six quarts of cranberries allow nine pounds 
of the best loaf sugar. Take three quarts of the cranberries, and put 
them into a stewpan with a pint and a half of water. Cover the pan, 
and boil or stew tliem till they are all to pieces. Then scpieeze the 
juice through a jelly bag. Put the sugar into a preserving kettle, 
pour the cranberry juice over it, and let it stand until it is all melted, 
stirring it up Irequcntly. Then place the kettle over the fire, and put 
in the remaining three quarts of whole cranberries. Let them boil 
till they are tender, clear, and of a bright colour, skimming them 
frequently. When done, put them warm into jars with the syrup, 
which should be like a thick jelly. 

Preserved Strawberries. — For every pound of fruit weigh a 
pound of refined sugar, {)Ut them with the sugar over the fire in a 
procelain kettle, bring to a boil slowly aljuut twenty minutes. Take 
them out carefully with a perforated skimmer, and fill your hot jars 
nearly full ; boil the juice a few minutes longer, and fill up the jars ; 
seal them hot. Keep in a cool, dry [ilace. 

To Preserve Berries Whole. (Excellent.)— lUiy the fruit 
when not too ripe, pick o\er immediately, wash if absolutely necessary, 
and put in glass jars, filling each one atjout two thirds full. 

Put in the preserving kettle a pound of sugar and one cupful of 
water for every two pounds of fruit, and let it come slowly to a boil. 
Pour this syrup into the jars over the berries, filling them up to the 
brim ; then set the jars in a pot of cold water on the stove, and let 
the water boil and the fruit become scalding hot. Now take them 
out and seal perfectly tight. If this process is followed thoroughly, 
the fruit will keep for se\eral years. 

Preserved Egg Plunns. — Use a pound of sugar for a pound of 
plums ; wash the plums, and wipe dry ; put the sugar on a slow fire 
in the preserving kettle, with as much water as will melt the sugar, 
and let it simmer slowly ; then prick each plum thoroughly with a 
needle, or a fork with fine prongs, and place a layer of them in the 
syrup. Let them cook until they lose their colour a little and the 
skins begin to break ; then lift them out with a perforated skimmer, 
and place them singly in a large dish to cool ; then put another layer 
of plums in the syrup, and let them cook and cool in the same manner, 
until the whole are done ; as they cool, carefully replace the broken 
skins so as not to spoil the appearance of the plums. When the last 
layer is finished, return the first to the kettle, and boil until trans- 
parent ; do the same with each layer ; while the latest cooked are 
cooling, place the first in glass jars ; when all are done, pour the hot 
syrup over them ; when they arc cold, close as usual ; the jelly should 
be of a rich colour and consiblcncy. 

Preserved Peaches. — Peaches for preserving may be ripe but 
not soft ; cut them in halves, take out the stones, and pare them 
neatly ; take as many pounds of white sugar as of fruit, put to each 
pound of sugar a teacupful of water ; stir it until it is dissolved ; set 



3o6 



PRESERVED FRUITS, JAMS, ETC. 



It over a moderate fire ; when it is boiling hot, put in tlie peaches ; 
let them boil gently until a pure, clear, uniform colour ; turn those at 
the bottom to the top carefully with a skimmer several times ; do not 
hurry them. When they are clear, take each half up with a spoon, 
and spread the halves on flat dishes to become cold. When all are 
done, let the syrup boil until it is cpiite thick ; pour it into a larj,^e 
pitcher antl let it set to cool and settle. When the peaches are cold 
j)ut them carefully into jars, and pour the syrup over them, leavinj( 
any sediment which has settled at the bottom, or strain the syrup. 
Some of the kernels from the peach-stones may be j7Ut in with the 
peaches while boiling. Let them remain open one niyht, then rover. 

In like manner quince, i)Ium, apricot, apijle, chcrrv, greengage and 
other fruit preserves are made ; in every case fine large fruit should 
be taken, free from imperfections and the slightest bruises or other 
fault should be removed. 

Preserved Green Tomatoes.— Take one peck of green 
tomatcjes. Slice si.K fresh lemons without removing the skins, but taking 
out the seeds ; ])ut to this cpiantity six pounds of sugar, common white, 
and boil until transparent and the svrui) thick. Cinger root maybe 
added, if liked. ^ 

Preserved Apples. (Whole.;— I'eel and core large firm 
apples (pip|)ins are best). Throw tiiem into water as you pare them, 
boil the ijarings in water for iifteen minutes, allowing a pint to one 
pound of fruit. Then strain, and, adding three-cpiarters of a pound 
of sugar to each pint of water, as measured at first, with enough 
lemon-peel, oraiigc-peel or mace, to impart a pleasant flavour, return 
to the kettle. When the syruj) has been well-skimmed and is clear, 
l)our It Ijoiling hot over the ajjples, which must be drained from the 
water m whuh they have hitherto stood. Let them remain in the 
syru]) until both are perfectly cold. Then, covering closelv, let them 
simmer over a slow fire until transparent. When all the ininuti.c of 
these directions are attended to, the fruit will remain unbroken, and 
present a beautiful and inviting appearance. 

Preserved Quinces.— Pare, core and quarter your fruit, then 
weigh It and alhnv an equal ciuantity of white sugar. Take the parings 
and cores, and i)ut in a preserving-kettle ; cover them with water and 
boil for half an hour ; then strain through a hair sieve, and i)ut the juice 
back into the kettle and boil the quinces in it a little at a time until 
they are tender ; lift out as they are done with a drainer and lay on a 
dish ; if the liquid seem scarce add more water. When all are cooked, 
throw into this litpior the sugar, and allow it to boil ten minutes before 
putting in the quinces ; let them boil until they change colour, say 
one hour and a quarter, on a slow fire ; while they are boiling occa- 
sionally slip a silver spoon under them to see that' they do not burn, 
but^ on no account stir them. Have two fresh lemons cut in thin slices' 
ami wlicn t!ie fruit is being put in jars lay a slice or two in each.' 
Quinces may be steamed until tender. 

Preserved Pears — One pound of fruit, one pound of 
sugar ; pare off the peeling thin. Make a nice syrup of nearly one 
cupful of water and one pound of sugar, and when clarified by boiling

and skimming put in the pears and stew gently until clear. Choose 
rather pears like the Seckle for preserving, both on account of the 
flavour and size. A nice way is to stick a clove in the blossom end 
of each pear, for this fruit seems to recjuire some extraneous flavour 
to bring out its own ])it|uancy. Another acceptable addition to pear 
jjreserves may be found instead, by adding the juice and thinly pared 
rind of one lemon to each five pounds of fruit. If the pears are hard 
and tough, parboil them until tender before beginning to preserve, 
and from the same water take what you need for making their syrup. 

If you can procure only large pears to preserve, cut them into 
halves, or even slices, so that they can get done more quickly, and 
lose notliing in appearance, either. 

Pineapple Preserves. — Twist off the top and bottom, and pare 
off the rough outside of pineaj)ples ; then weigh them and cut them 
in slices, chips or quarters, or rut them in four or six, and shape each 
piece like a whole pineapi)le ; to each pound of fruit, put a tcacupful 
of water ; put it in a preserving kettle, cover it antl set it over the tire, 
and let them boil gently until they are tender and clear ; then take 
them from the water, by sticking a fork in the centre of each slice, or 
with a skimmer, into a dish. 

Put to tlij water white sugar, a pound for eacli pound (jf fruit ; stir 
it until it is all dissolved ; then put in the pineapple, cover the kettle, 
and let them boil gently until transparent tlirou^hout ; when it is so, 
take it out, let it cool, and put it in glass jars ; let the syrup boil or 
simmer gently until it is thick and rich, and wlien nearly cool, pour it 
over the fruit. The next day secure the jars, as before dire<:ted. 

Pineaijple done in this way is a beautiful and delicious preserve. 
The usual manner of preserving it, by putting it into the syrup without 
first boiling it, makes it little better than sweetened leather. 

To preserve Watermelon Rind and Citron — Pare off 
the green skin, cut the watermelon rind into pieces. Weigh the 
pieces, and allow to each pound a pound and a half of loaf sugar. 
Line your kettle with green vine-leaves, and put in the pieces without 
the sugar. A layer of vine-leaves must cover each layer of melon rind. 
Pour in water to cover the whole, and place a thick cloth over the 
kettle. Sinmier the fruit for two hours, after scattering a few bits of 
alum amongst it. Sptead the melon rind on a dish to cool. Melt the 
sugar, using a pint of water to a pound and a half of sugar, and mix 
with it some beaten white of egg. Boil and skim the sugar. When 
quite clear, put in the rind, and let it boil two hours ; take out the 
rind, boil the syrup again, pour it over the rind, and let it remain all 
night. The next morning, boil the syrup with lemon-juice, allowing 
one lemon to a quart of syrup. When it is thick enough to hang in 
a drop from the point of a spoon, it is done. Put the rind in jars, 
and pour over it the syrup. It is not fit for use immediately. 

Citrons may be preserved in the same manner, first paring off the 
outer skin, and cutting them into quarters. Also green limes. 

To Preserve and Dry Greengages. — To every pound of 
sugar allow one pound of fruit, one quarter pint of water. 

For this purpose, the fruit must be used before it is quite ripe, and 



3o8 



PRESERVED FRUITS, JAMS, ETC. 




part of the stalk must be left on. Weigh the fruit, rejecting all that 
is in the least decree blemished, and put it invo a lined saucepan with 
the sugar and water, which should have been previously boiled 
together to a rich syrup. IJoil the fruit in this for ten minutes, remove 
it from the fire, and drain the greengages. The next day boil up the 
syruj) and put in the fruit again, let it simmer for three minutes, and 
drain the syrup away. Continue this process f( r five or six days, and 
the last time place the greengages, when drained, on a hair sieve, and 
put them in an oven or warm spot to dry ; keep them in a box, with 
paper between each layer, in a place free from damp. 

Preserved Pumpkins — To each pound of pumpkin allow 
one pound of roughly ])ounded loaf-sugar, one gill of lemon-juice. 

Obtain a good, sweet pumpkin ; halve it, take out the seeds, and 
pare off the rind ; cut it into neat slices. Weigh the pumpkin, put the 
slices in a pan or deep dish in layers, with the sugar sprinkled 
between them ; pour the lemon-juice over the top, and let the whole 
remain for two or three days. Boil all together, adding half a pint of 
water to every three ])ounds o' sugar useil until the pumpkin becomes 
tender ; then turn the whole into a pan, where let it remain for a 
iveck ; then drain off the syrup, boil it until it is quite thick ; skim, 
and pour it boiling over the pumpkin. A little bruised ginger, and 
lemon-rind, thinly pared, may Ijc boiled in the syrup to flavour the 
pumpkin. 

Preserving Fruit. (New iVlode.)— Take some pure white 
vinegar and mix with it granulated sugar until a syrup is formed quite 
free from acidity. Pour this syrup into earthen jars and put in it 
good, perfectly ripe fruit, gathered in dry weather. Cover the jars 
tight, and put them in a dry place. The contents will keep for six or 
eight months, and tlic flavour of the fruit will he excellent. 

To Preserve Fruit Without Sugar.— Cherries, straw- 
berries, slicrd pineap])le, plums, apricots, gooseberries, et':., may be 
preserved in the following manner — to be used the same as fresh 
fruit. 

Ciather the fruit before it is very ripe ; put it in wide mouthed 
bottles made for the purpose ; fill them as full as they will hold, and 
cork them tight ; seal the corks,; put some hay in a large saucepan, 
set in the bottles, with hay between them to prevent their touching ; 
then fill the saucepan with water to the necks of the bottles, and set 
it over the fire until the water is nearly boiling, then take it oflf ; let it 
stand until the bottles are cold. Keep them in a cool place until 
wanted, when the fruit will be found e(|ual to fresh. 

New Method of Preserving Fruit.— Pears, apples and 
other fruits are reduced to a paste by jamming, which is then pressed 
into cakes and gently dried. When required for use it is only 
necessary to pour four times their weight of boiling water over them, 
and auow tnem to soarc lor twenty rninutes, and tiicn odd sugar to suit 
the taste. The fine flavour of the fruit is said to be retained to 
perfection. The cost of the prepared product is scarcely greater than 
that of the original fruit, difiering with the supply and price of the 
latter ; the keeping qualities are excellent, so that it may be had at

any time of the year, and bears long sea-voyages withou'. detriment. 
No pcclihg or coring is re<|uirtd so there is no waste. 

Fruit Jellies. — Take a stone jar and put in the fruit, place 
this in a kettle of tejjid water, and set on the fire ; let it boil closely 
covered, until the fruit is broken to pieces ; strain, jircssing the bag, 
a stout, coarse one, hard, putting in a few handfuls each time, and 
between each scjucezing turning it inside out to scald off the pulp and 
skins. To each pint of juice allow a jiound of loaf sugar ; set the 
juice on alone to boil, and while it is boiling, put the sugar into 
shallow dishes or pans, and beat it in the oven, watching and stirring 
the sugar to prevent burnin', ; boj] the juice just twenty minutes from 
the time it begins fairly to boil. V,y this time the sugar should be very 
hot ; throw the sugar into the boiling juice, stirring rapidly all the 
time ; withdraw the spoon when all is thoroughly dissolved ; let the 
jelly come to a boil to make all certain ; withdraw the kettic instantly 
from the fire ; roll your glasses and cups in hot water, and fill with the 
scalding liquid; the jelly will form within an hour; when cold, close 
and tie up as you do preserves. 

Currant Jelly. — Currants for jelly should be perfectly ripe 
and "gathered ihe first week of the season ; they lose tlicir jelly pro- 
perty if they hang on the bushes too long, and become too juic) — the 
juice will not be apt to congeal. Stri]) them from the stalks, put them 
into a stone jar, and set it in a vessel of hot water over the fire ; keep 
the water around it boiling until the currants are all broken, stirring 
them up occasionally. Then stpieezc them through a coarse cloth or 
towel. To each pint of juice allow a pound and a (piarter of refined 
sugar. I'ut the sugar into a porcelain kettle, pour the juice over it, 
stirring frecpiently. Skim it before it boils ; boil about twenty 
minntes, or until it congeals in the spoon when held in the air. I'our 
it into hot jelly glasses and seal when cool. 

Wild fruit jelly is nice made after this recipe. 

Currant Jelly. (New Method.)— This recipe for making 
superior jelly without heat is given in a Parisian journal of chemistry, 
whi( h may be worth trying by some of our readers. The currants are 
to be washed and squeezed in the usual way, and the juice placed in 
a stone or earthen vessel, and set away in a cool place in the cellar. 
In about twenty-four hours a considerable amount of froth will cover 
the surface, produced by fermentation, and this must be removed, and 
the whole strained again through the jelly bag, then weighed, and an 
equal weight of powdered white sugar is to be added. This is to be 
stirred constantly until entirely dissolved, and then put into jars, tied 
up tightly, and set away. At the end of another twenty-four hours a 
perfectly transparent jelly of the most satisfactory flavour will be 
formed, which will keep as long as if it had been cooked. 

Quince Jelly. — Quinces for jeliy should not be quite ripe, 
they should be a fine yellow ; rub otT the down from them, core them, 
and cut them small ; put them in a preserving kettle with a teacupful 
of water for each pound ; let them stew gently until soft, without 
mashing ; put them in a thin muslin bag with the liquor ; press them 
very lightly. To each pint of the liquor put a pound of sugar ; stir it

until it is all dissolved, then set it over the fire, and let it boil Kcntly, 
until by coolinK some on a plate you find it a good jelly ; then turn it 
into pots or tumblers, and when cold, secure as directc-d for jellies. 

Raspberry Jelly. — To each pint of juice allow one pound of 
suKar. Let the raspberries be freshly K<ithercd, (luite ripe, picked 
from the stalks; put them into a lar^e jar after breakiuK the fruit a 
little with a wooden sjjoon, an(i place this jar, covered, in a saucepan 
(jf boiling water. When the juice is well drawn, which will be in from 
three-(iua'rters to one hour, strain the fruit throuijh a tine hair sieve or 
cloth ; measure the juice, and to every pint allow the above |)roportion 
of white suK.'ir. Put the juice and sugar into a preserving-pan, place 
it over the fire, and boil gently until the jelly thi< kens, when a little is 
poured on a |)late ; carefully rennn e all the s( um as it rises, p<)ur the 
jelly into small pots, cover down, and keep in a dry place. This jelly 
answers for making raspberry cream, and for flavouring various sweet 
dishes, when, in winter, the fresh fruit is not obtainable. 

Apple Jelly.—Select apples that are ather tart and highly 
flavoured ; slice them without i)aring ; place in a porcelain jireserving- 
kettle, cover with water, and let them cook slowly until the apples 
look red. Tour into a colander, drain off the juice, r>nd let this run 
through a jellv-bag ; return to the kettle, which must be carefully 
washed, and boil half an hour ; measure it and allow to every pint of 
juice a pound of sugar and half the juice of a lemon ; boil quickly for 
ten minutes. 

'I'hejui(e of apples, boiled in shallow vessels, without a particle of 
sugar, makes the most sparkling, delicious jelly imagi"d)le. Keil 
apples will give jelly the colour and clearness of claret, while that 
from light fruit is like amber. Take the cider just as it is made, not 
allowing it to ferment at all, and, if possible, boil it in a pan, flat, very 
large, and shallow. 

Grape Jelly.— Mash well the berries so as to remove the 
skins ; jjour all into a preserving kettle, and cook slowb- fo'" a few 
minutes to extract the juice ; strain through a coland' ' then 

thrt)ugh a flannel jelly-bag ; keejjing as hot as possible, : " not 
allowed to cool before putting again on the stove the jelly comes 
much sliffer. A few cpiince seeds boiled with the berries the first 
lime lend to stiffen it ; measure the juice, allowing a pound of loaf 
sugar to every pint of juice, and boil fast for at least half an hour. 
Try a litllo. and if it seems done, remove and put into glasses. 

Orange Jelly. — (irate the yellow rind of two oranges and two 
lemons, and squeeze the juice into a porcelain lined preserving- 
kettle, adding the juice of two more oranges, and removing all the 
seeds ; put in the grated rind a quarter of a pound of sugar, or more 
if the fruit is sour, and a gill of water, and boil these ingredients to- 
gether until a rich syrup is formed. Meantime, dissolve tw(} ounces 
oi gelaiine in a quart of warm water, stirring it over the tire until it is 
enl'irelv dissolved ; then add the syrup, strain the jelly, and cool it in 
moulds wet in cold water. 

Crab-Apple Jelly.— The apples should be juicy and ripe. 
The fruit is then quartered, the black spots in the cores removed,

afterward put into a preserving-kettle over the fire, with a teacupful of 
water in the bottom to prevent burning ; more water is added as it 
evaporates while cooking. When boiled to a pulp, strain the apples 
through a coarse flannel, then proceed as for currant jelly. 

Peach Jelly. — I'are the peaches, take out the stones, then 
slice them ; add to them about a tpiarter of the kernels. I'lace them 
in a kettle with enough water to cover them. Stir them often until 
the fruit is well cooked, then strain, and to every pint of the juice add 
the juice of a lemon ; measure again, allowing a pound of sugar to 
each |)int (jf juice; heat the sugar very hot, and add when the juice 
has boiled twenty minutes ; let it come to a boil, and take instantly 
from the fire. 

Orange Syrup. — Pare the oranges, scjuceze and strain the 
juice from the jjulp. To one pint of juice allow one [)ound :\nd 
three-quarters of loaf sugar. Put the juice and sugar t(jgethcr, boil 
and skim it until it i?> cream ; then strain it through a flannel bag, 
and let it stand until it becomes cool, then put in bottles and c>rk 
tight. 

Lemon syrup is made in the same way, except that you scald the 
lemons, and scpiee/e out the juice, allowing rather more sugar. 

Orang^c Marmalade. — .Allow i)ound fer pound. I'are half 
the oranges, and cut the rind into shreds. H(m1 in three waters until 
tender, and set aside, (irate the rind of the remaining oranges ; 
take off, and throw away every bit of the thick white inner skin ; 
cjuarter all the oranges and take out the seeds. Chcjp, or cut them 
into small pieces ; drain all the juice that will come away, witht)ut 
pressing them, ov.-r the sugar ; heat this, stirring until the sugar is 
dissolved, adding a very little w.iter, unless the oranges are very juicy, 
lioil and skim five or six minutes ; put in the boiled shreds, and cook 
ten minutes ; then the chopped fruit and grated peel, and boil twenty 
minutes longer. When cold, put into small jars, tied uj) with bladder 
or paper ne.xt the fruit, cloths dipped in wax over all. A nicer way ^-till 
is to put away in tumblers with self-adjusting metal tojis. Press 
tissue paper down closely to the fruit. 

Lemon Marmalade. — Is made as you would prepare orange — 
allowing a pound and a ouarter of sugar to a pcjund of fruit, and using 
but half the grated peel. 

Strawberry Jam. — To each pound of fine, and not too ripe 
berries, allow three-quarters of a pound of sugr'' Put them into a 
preserving pan, and stir gently, not to break up he fruit ; simmer 
for one-half hour, and put into pots air-tight. .'\n excellent way to 
seal jellies and jams is as the Cierman women do : Cut round covers 
from writing paper a half-inch too large for the tops, smear the inside 
with the unbeaten white of an egg, tie f)ver with a cord, and it will dry 
quickly and be absolutely preservative. A circular paper laid (iver 
the touthsuiiic contents before covering, wil't prevent any danipneSS 
from artecting the flavour. I have removed these covers heavy with 
mould to find the preserve intact. 

Gooseberry Jam. — Pick the gooseberries just as they begin 
to turn. Stem, wash and weigh. To four pounds of fruit add half a 



3,2 COLOURING FOR FRUIT, ETC. 

Ic.icupful of Wilier ; boil until soft and add four pounds of sugar and 
boil until clear. If picked at the riKlU stage the jam will be amber- 
( ..loured and firiii, and very much nicer than if the fruit is preserved 

when ripi'. 

Raspberry Jam. -To five or six pounds of fine red rasp- 
berries (nut too ripej add an equal (juanlity of the finest quantity of 
white sugar. Mash tin; whult; well in a preserving kettle ; add about 
one quart of currant juice (a little less will do), and boil gently until it 
jellies ujjon a < old ])late ; then put into small jars ; cover with thin 
paper, and lie .i thick white paper over them. Keep in a dark, 
dry and cool place, lilackberry or strawberry jam is made in the 
sanu- way, U-aving nut the currant juice. 

Another New Way of keeping Fruit. -It is stated that 
experiments have been made in keejiing fruit in jars covered only 
with cotton batting, and at the end of two years the fruit was sound. 
The following directicjiis are given for tlie process : Use crocks, 
stone butter-jars or any other convenient dishes. I'rejiare and cook 
the fruit jjreciseiy as for canning in glass jars ; fill your dishes with 
fruit while liot, and immediately cover with collm batting, securely 
tied on. Remember that all putrefaction is caused by the invisible 
creatures in the air.. Cooking the fruit expels all these, and they 
cannot pass through the cotton batting. The fruit thus protected 
will keep an indefinite jieriod. It will be remembered that Tyndall 
has proved that the atmospheric germs canni.t pass through a la>i;r 
of cotton. 



CHAPTER X.X.XVI. 

COLOURING FOR FRUIT, ETC 

Red or Pink Colouring. — Take a pennyworlli of cochineal. 
Lav it on a tlat plate, and bruise it with the blade of a knife. Put it 
into half a teacui)ful of alcohol. Let it stand a (lu; :*'n- of an hour, 
and then filter it through fine muslin. Always ready for immediate 
use. Cork the bottle light. 

Strawberry or cranberry juice makes a fine colouring for frosting 
sweet puddings and confectionery. 

Deep Red Colouring. — Take twenty grains of cochineal, and 
fifteen grains of cream of tartar finely powdered, add to them a piece 
of alum the size of a cherry stone, and boil them with a gill of soft 
water, in an earthen vessel, slowly, for half an hour. Then strain it 
through muslin, and keep it tightly corked in a phial. If a little 
alcohol is added, it will keep any length of time. 

Yellow Colouring. — Take a little saffron, put it into an 
earthen vessel with a very small quantity of cold, soft water, and let 
it steep till the colour of the infusion is a bright yellow. Then strain 
it, add half alcohol to it. To colour fruit yellow, boil the fruit with 
fresh skin lemons in water to cover them until it is tender ; then take 
it up, spread it on dishes to cool, and finish as may be directed. 

To colour icing, put the grated peel of a lemon or orange in a thin 



COFFEE, TEA AND HEX'EKAdES u -, 

muslin ba^, si|ucezin^' in a little juice throuj,'h it, then mix n 
the su^(ar. 

Green Oolourinff.— Take fresh spinach or beet leave 
pound tliL-in in a marble mortar. If you want it for inimedialc , 
take off the K^ccn froth as it rises, and mix it with the articles you 
intend to colour. If you wish to keep it a few days, take the juice 
when you have pressed out a teacupful, and adding to it a piece of 
alum the size of a pea, give it a boil in a saucepan. Or make the 
juite very stronj^^ and add a nuart of alcohol. 'Jottle it air-tij^lU. 

Sugar Grains. — These are made by p(nindin},' white lump 
sugar in a mortar and shaking it through sieves of different degrees 
of coarseness, thus ac( umulating grains of different sizes. They are 
used in ornainentini; cake. 

Sugar Grains, Coloured.— Stir a little colouiing — as the 
essence of spinach, or prepared cochineal, or licpiid carmine, or indigo, 
rouge, saffron, etc.,— into the sugar grains made as above, until each 
grain is stained, then spread them on a baking-sheet, and dry them 



m 



a warm plai • . They are used in orramenting lake. 



Caramel or Burnt Sngar. — I'ut one cupful of sugar and 
two teas[)oonfuls of water in a saucepan on the fire ; stir constantly 
until it is tjuite a dark colour, then add a half cupful of water, and a 
pinch of salt ; let it boil a few minutes, and when cold, bottle. 

For colouring soups, sauces or gravies. 

To Clarify Jelly. — The white of eggs is, perhaps, the 
best substance that (an ])c employed in clarifying jelly, as well as 
some other fluids, for the reason that when albumen (and the white 
of eggs is nearly pure albumen) is put into a licpiid that is muddy, 
from substances suspended in it, on boiling the licpiid the allnimen 
coagulates in a flocculent manner, and, entangling with the impurities, 
rises with them to the surface as a scum, or sinks to the btittom, 
according to their weight. 



CHAPTER XX.XVU. 

COFFEE, TEA, AND BEVERAGES 

Boiling Water. — Roiling water is a very important desideratum 
in ihf nviking of a good cup of coffee or tea, l)ut the average house- 
wife is very apt to overlook this fact. Do not boil the water more 
than three or four minutes ; longer boiling ruins the water for coffee 
or tea-making, as most of its natural properties escape by evaporation, 
leaving a very insipid liquid, composed mostly of lime and iron, that 
would ruin the best coffee, and give the tea a dark, dead look, which 
ought to be the reverse. 

Water left in the tea-kettle over night must never be used for 
preparing the breakfast coffee ; no matter how excellent your coliee 
or tea may be, it will be ruined by the addition of water that has been 
boiled more than once. 

Healing Properties of Tea. — The medical properties of 
these two beverages are considerable. Tea is used advantageously 




314 



COFFKK, TEA AND UEVKKACES 




in inflammatory diseases and as a cure for the lu'a<la« he. Coffee is 
suppiscd to act as a i)rcventive of gravel and ^out, and to its influence 
is as( rihed the rarity »)f tliose diseases in France and Turkey. Uoth

Healing Properties of Ooffoo. -After KiindinK the coffee 
moilcratelv tme, < arefiiUy measure in a howl, allowing,' one tablespoon- 
ful to every pers«.n. Add \shite of an cj^k. ii^i"K «'»<• ^hH to each cup 
of Kround coffee, and nux with water sufficient to thorouKhly saturate 
the grounds. Empty this mixture into the cotitee-pot, then pour on 
boiling water, a ( upful to each tal)lespoonful of the ground coffee. 
Boil brisklv for ten minutes, add a small amount of cold w.tler, and 
set aside ten minutes to settle. Serve immediately, permitting each 
person to sweeten his i ( up to suit the individu;.! taste. A table- 
spoonful of whipped ( m, laid on each cup, adds greatly to the 
elegance of the beverage. ( )piiiions differ as to the exact [)rop«)rtions 
of Moch.i, I.iva, etc., which should l)e mixed to prodiK e the best 
effect ; but it is generally conceded that Mocha and Jav.i mixed in 
ecpial p.irts produce a cpiality which is not eauily surpassed, and we 
therefiiri' rec oinniciid it for use in f(jllowing these ret ipes. 

Vienna Ooffee.— Allow one heaping tablespoonfui of coflfee 
to each person, and twd extra to make good strength. Mix one egg 
with grounds; pour on coffee half as much boiling water as will be 
needetl ; let coffee froth, then stir down grounds, and let boil five 
minutes ; then let cofi'ee stand where it will keep hot, but not boil, for 
five or ten minutes, and .idd rest of water. To one pint of cream add 
the white of an egg, well-beaten ; this is to be put in cups with sugar, 
and hot cotVee addeil. 

Filtered or Drip Coffee.— For each person allow a large 
table->poonful of fmeiy ground ( otiee, and to every tablespoonful allow 
a cupful of boiling water. 

Have .1 small iron ring made to fit the top of the coftec-pot mside, 
and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for this purpose 
must not be too thin!. Fit the bag into the pot, pour some boiling 
water in it, and when the pot is well-warmed, put the ground coffee 
into the bag ; pour (jver as much boiling water as is required, close 
the lid, and, when all the water h.is filtered through, remove the bag, 
and send the coffee to t.ible. Making it in this manner prevents the 
necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which 
cools and spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee 
gradually so that the infusion may be stronger ; and the bag must be 
well made thai none of the grt)unds may escape through the seams 
and so make the coffee thick and n.uddy. 

Patent coffee-pots on this principle can be purchased at most 
house-f'jrnishing stores. 

iced Coffee.— Make more coffee than usual at breakfast time 
and stronger. When cold put on ice. Serve with cracked ice in each 
tumbler.

How to make Tea properly. —.Allow two teaspoonfuls of 

tea to one large cnptul «if boiling w.itei. Scald the te.ipot, put in the 
tea, pour on about a cupful of boiling water, set it on the tire in u 
warm place where it will not boil, but keep very hot, to almost 
boiling; let it steep or "draw" ten or twelve minutes. Now till up 
with aa inu( h boiliti,i, water as is reciuircd. Send hot to the table. 
It is better to use a china or porcelain teapot, but if you do use 
metal let it be tin, new bright ami rlean ; never use it when the tin is 
worn off and the ircjn exposed. If you do you are drinking tea-ate 
of iron. 

To make tea to perfection, boiling water must be poured on the 
leaves directly it boils. Water which has been boiling more than five 
minutes, or which has previously boiled, should on no ac« ount be 
used. Iftlu water does not boil, or if it be allowed to overboil, the 
leaves of the tea will be only half-o|)en»;il and the tea itself will be 
quite spoiled. The water shoukl be allowed to remain on the leaves 
from ten to fifteen minutes. 

A Chinese being interviewed for the Ctii>^' says : Drink your tea 
plain. Don't add milk or sugar. Tea-brokers and tea-tasters never 
do; epKures never tlo ; tiie Chinese never do. N'llk contains fibrin, 
albumen or some other stuff", and the tea a deliciite amount of tannin. 
Mixing the two makes the liquid turbid. Tlii.-> tirbidity, if I remember 
the cyclopaxlia aright, is tannate of fibrin, or 'cather. I'eople who 
put milk in tea are therefore drinking l)oots and shoes in mild 
disguise. 

Iced Tea. — Is now served to a considerable extent during the 
summer months. It is of course used without milk, and the addition 
of sugar serves only to destroy the finer tea flavour. It may be pre- 
pared some hours in advance, and should be rniidc stronger than when 
served hot. It is bottled and placed in the ice-chest till required. 
Use the black ov green teas, or both, mixed, as fancied. 

Chocolate. — .Allow half a cupful of grated chocolate to a pint of 
water and a pint of milk. Rub the chocolate smooth in a little cold 
water, and stir into the boiling water. Boil twenty minutes, add the 
milk and boil ten minutes more, stirring it often. Sweeten to your 
taste. 

The French put two cupfuls of boiling water to each cupful of 
chocolate. They throw in the chocolate just as the water commences 
to boil. Stir it with a spoon as soon as it boils up, add two cupfuls of 
good milk, and when it has boiled sufficienily, serve with a spoonful 
of thick whipped cream with each cup. 

Cocoa. — Six tablespoonfuls of cocoa to each pint of water, as 
much milk as water, sugar to taste. Rub cocoa smooth in a little 
cold water ; have ready on the fire a pint of boiling water ; stir in 




3i6 



COFFEE, TEA AND BEVERAGES 




gnited ( ocoa paste, lioil twenty minutes, add milk and boil five 
minutes more, stirring often. Sweeten in cups so as to suit different 
tastes. 

Buttermilk as a Drink. — Buttermilk, so generally regarded 
as a waste pnjduct, has latterly been coming somewhat into vogue, 
not only as a nutrient, but as a therapeutic agent, and has been highly 
extolled for its virtues. Buttermilk may be roughly described as milk 
which has lost most of its fat and a small percentage of casein, and 
which has become sour by fermentation. Long experience has 
demonstrated it to be an agent of superior digestibility. It is, indeed, 
a true milk peptone — that is, milk already partially digested, the 
coagulation of the coagulable portion being loose and flaky, and not 
of that tirm indigestible nature which is the result of the action of the 
gastric juice upon sweet cow's milk. It resembles koumiss in its 
nature, and, with the excejition of that article, it is the most grateful, 
refreshing, and digestible of the products of milk. It is a decided 
laxative to the bowels, a fact which must be borne in mind in the 
treatment of typhoid fever, and which may be turned to advantage in 
the treatment of habitual constijjalion. It is a diuretic, and may be 
prescribed with advantage in some kidney troubles. Owing to its 
acidity, combined with its laxative properties, it is believed to exercise 
a general impression on the liver. It is well adapted to many cases 
where it is customary to recommend lime water ami milk. It is 
invaluable in the treatment of diabetes, either exclusively, or alterna- 
ting with skimmed milk. In some cases of gastric ulcer and cancer 
of the stomal h, it is the only food that can be retained. 

iVIetheiin, or Honey Wine. — To some new honey, strained, 
add sjjring water ; put a whole egg into it ; boil this liquor till the

■very 



fiiteen gallons and two ounces of white Jamaica ginger, bruised, one 
ounce of cloves and mace, one and a half ounces of cinnamon, all 
bruised together, and tied up in a muslin bag ; accelerate the fer- 
mentation with yeast ; when worked sufficiently, bung up ; in six 
weeks draw off into buttles. 

Ginger Beer.— Put into a kettle two ounces of powdered ginger 
root [ov n)ore if it is not very strong), half an ounce of cream of tartar, 
two large lemons, cut in slices, two pounds of broken loaf sugar, and 
two gallons of soft boiling water. Simmer them over a slow fire for 
half an hour. When the liquor is nearly cold, stir into it a large 
tablespoonful of the best yeast. After it has fermented, which will be 
in about twenty-k)ur hours, bottle for use. 

Sassa'fars Mead.— Mix gradually with two quarts boiling water 
three pijunds and a half of the best brown sugar, a pint and a half of 
good molasses, and a (.[uarter of a pound of tartaric acid. Stir it well, 
and when cool, strain it into a large jug or pan, then mix in a tea- 
spooniul [IhA more) of essence of sassafras. Transfer it to clean 
bottles, (it will fill about lialf a dozen,) cork it tightly, and keep it in a 
cool place. It will be fit for use next day. Put into a box or boxes a 
tjuarter of a i)ound of carbi)nate of soda to use with it. To prepare a

Sassafras mead will be found a cheap, wholesome, and pleasant lje- 
verage for warm weather. The essence of sassafras, tartaric acid and 
carbonate of soda, can, of course, all be obtained at the druggists. 

Cream Soda without the Fountain. — Coffe-sugar, four 
pounds ; threejiintsof water,threenutmcgs, grated, ihewhitesof ten eggs, 
well-beaten, gum arabic, one ounce ; twenty drops of oil of lemon, or 
■extract equal to that amount, liy using oils of other fruits, you can 
make as many flavours from this as you desire. Mix all, and place 
■over a gentle fire, and stir well about thirty minutes ; remove from 
the fire and strain, and divide into two parts ; into one-half put eight 
ounces of bi-carbonate of soda, into the other half put six ounces of 
tartaric acid. Shake well, and when cold they are ready for use by 
pouring three or four spoonfuls from both parts into separate glasses, 
each one-third full of water. Stir each and pour together, and you 
have a nice glass of cream soda which you can drink at ycnu' leisure, 
as the gum and eggs hold the gas. 

Lemon Syrup. — Take the juice of twelve lemons grate 
the rind oi' six in it, let it stand over night ; then take six pounds 
of white sugar, and make a thick syrup. When it is c|uite cool, strain 
the juice into it, and squeeze as much oil from the grated rind as will 
suit the taste. Put in bottles, securely corked, for future use. A 
tablespoonful in a goljlet of water will make a delicious drink on a hot 
day. 

Summer Draught. — The juice ofone lemon, a tumblerful of cold 
water, pounded sugar to taste, half a small teaspoonful of ( arbonate

strained juice of one lemon and one and a half pints of cold water, mix 
thoroughly, and set in ice-chest till wanted.

made in strawberry season. 

Strawberrry and Raspberry Syrup. — Mash the fresh fruit 
•express the juice, and to each quart add three and a half pounds of 
granulated sugar. The juice, heated to 180" Farenheit, and strained

COFFEE, TEA AND BEVERAGES 




Boil it all to^ctlier about ten minutes, skim carefully until nothing 
rises to the surface, take from the fire ; when cool, bottle it. Black- 
berries and rasplx-rries, and, in fact, any kind of hi^dily flavoured fruit, 
is fine ; a tablespoonful in a glass of ice-cold water, to drink in warm 
weather. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — Tut a (|uart of raspberries into a suitable 
dish, pour over them a quart of good vinegar, let it stand twenty-four 
hours, tlu-n strain throu;.4h tlannel bag, and pour this licpior on another 
quart of berries ; do this for three or f(jur days successively, and strain 
it ; make it very sweet with loaf sugar ; liottle and seal it. 

Home-made Table Vinegar— I'ut in an open cask four gallons 
of warm rain-water, unv. .gallon of ( ommon molasses, and two quarts of 
yeast : cover the toj) with thin muslin and leave it in the sun, covering 
it up at ni^hl and when it rains. In three or four weeks it will be 
j^ood vinegar. If cider (an be used in place of rain-water the vinegar 
will make nun h sooner — will not take over a week to make a \ery 
sharji \ ine-ar. Kx^cllent for pickling jjurposcs. 

Very strong Table Vinegar. — Take two gallons of good 
cider and thoroughly mix it w ith two [)()unds of new honey, pour into 
your I ask or bottle, and let it stand from four to six months, when you 
will have the vinegar so strong that it cannot t)e used at table without 
diluting with water. It is the best ever procured for pickling 
|)urp()--es. 

Pineapple Ade. — Pare and slice some very ripe pineapples ; 
then cut the slices into small pieces. i'ut them with all their juice 
into a large pitcher, and sprinkle among them plenty of powdered

COOKINC. FOR INVALIDS 319 

CHAPTER XXXVIII. 

COOKING FOR INVALIDS 

DiSHl.-; for invalids shoukl be se cd in the daintiest and most 
attractive way ; never send more than a supply for one meal ; the 
same dish too frequently set before an invalid often causes a distaste, 
when perhaps a change would tempt the appetite. 

When preparing dishes where milk is used, the condition of the 
patient should be considered. Long cooking hardens the albumen 
and makes the milk very constipating ; then, if the patient should l)e 
already (;onstii)ated, care should be taken not to heat the milk ab(»ve 
the boiling point. 

The seasoning of food for the sick shoukl be varied according to 
the condition of the patient ; one recovering from illness can jjartake 
of a little piece of roast mutton, chicken, rabbit, game, lisl., ^^imply 
dressed, and simple puddings ;ire all li.^llt food and easily digested. A 
muttt^n chop, nicely cut, trimmed and broiled, is a tli^h that is often 
inviting to ;in invalid. .-Vs a rule, an inv.ilid will be more likely to 
enjoy an\ preparation sent to him if it is servetl in small, delicate 
pieces. -Xs there are so many small, dainty dishes that can be made 
for this purpose, it seems useless to try to more than give a small 
variety of them. Pudding can be made of jjrepared barlev, or tapioi a, 
well-soaked before boiling, with an egg atlded, ;ind a change can be 
made of light puddings by mixing up some stewed fruit with the 
pud(lin;^s before l)aking ; a bread pudding from stale bread-crumbs, 
and a tin\- cup-custard, boiled in a small basin or cup ; .also various 
drink>. >arh as hot milk, wlies', apple-toddy, and various (jther 
nourisliiiv^ drinks. 

Beefsteak and Mutton Chops. — Select the teiuleresi cuts, 
and broil over a ( lear, hot tire. Let the steak be rare, the chops well done. 
Salt and pt;p[)er ; lay between two hot plates three minutes, and serve 
to your patit.MU. If he is very weak, do not let him swallow anything 
except the juice, when he has cheuid ih<- ui.-at well. The essence of 
rare beef, roasted or broiled, thus e\pre»ed, is tonsitlered by some 
physicians to be more strengthening than beef tea prepared in the 
usual manner. 

Beef Tea. — One pound of lean beef, cut into small piei:es. Pu 
into a glass canning-jar without a droj) of water ; cover tightly, and set 
in a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil, and continue this 
steadily for three or four liours, until the meat is like white rags, and 
the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to taste, and when cold, skim. 

Veal or Mutton Broth. — Take a scrag-end of mutton (two 
pounds', put it in a saucepan, with two ipiarts of cold water, and an 
ounce of pearl barley or rice. When it is coming to a boil, skim it 
well, then add half a teaspoonful of salt ; let it boil until half reduced, 
then strain it, and take off all the fat, and it is ready ior use. iliis 
is excellent for an invalid. If vegetables are liked in this broth, take 
one turnip, one carrot, and one onion, cut them in shreds, and boil 
them in the broth half an hour. In that case, the barley may be 
may be served with the vegetables in broth.

COOKING FOR INVALIDS 



Chicken Broth. — Make tlie same as mutton or beef broth. 
Boil the chicken slowiy, puttin),^ on just enough water to cover it well, 
watching it closely that it does not boil down too much. When the 
chicken is tender, season with salt and a very little pepper. The 
yolk of an egg beaten light and added, is very nourishing. 

Oatmeai Gruel.-— I'ut four tablespoonfuls of the best grits oat- 
meal coarsely ground) into a pint of boiling water. Let it boil gently, 
and stir it often, till it becomes as thick as you wish it. Then strain 
it, and add to it while warm, butter, nutmeg, or whatever is thought 
proper to flavour it. Salt to taste. 

If you make the gruel of fine oatmeal, sift it, mix it first to a thick 
batter with a little cold water, and then put it into the saucepan of 
boiling water. Stir it all the time it is boiling, lifting the spoon gently 
up and down, and letting the gruel fall slowly back again into the 
pan. 

Corn-meal Gruel. —Two tal)lespooofuis of fine Indian meal, 
mixed smooth with ( old water and a salt-spoonful of salt ; add one 
quart of boiling water, and co(jk twenty minutes. Stir it fre(|uently, 
and if it becomes t(Jo thick use boiling water to thin it. If the 
stomach is not too weak, a tablesjxjonful of cream may be used to 
cool it. Some like it sweetened and others like it plain. For very 
sick persons, let it settle, pf)ur off tiie to|), and give without other 
seasoning. For convalescents, toast a piece of bread as nicely as 
as possible, and put it in the gruel with a tablespoonful of nice sweet 
cream, and a little ginger and sugar. This should be used only when 
a l;ixati\c is allowed. 

EgS Gruel. — Ik-at the yolk of an egg with 'one tablespoonful 
of sugar ; jtour one teacupful of boiling water on it ; add the white of 
an egg, beaten to a froth, uith any seasoning or spice desired. Take 
w.irm. 

Milk Porridge. — The same as arrowroot, excepting it should 
be all milk, and thickened with a scant tablespocjnful of sifted flour ; 
let it boil five minutes, stirring it continu.illy, add a little cold milk, 
and give it one l)oil uj), and it is ready for use. 

Arrowroot Milk Porridge. — One large cujjful of fresh milk, 
new if you i an get it ; one cu|)ful of boiling water; one teaspoonful 
of arrowroot, wet to a jjaste with cold water ; two teaspoonfuls of 
white sugar ; a pinch tif salt. I'ut the sugar into the milk, the salt 
into the boiling water, which should be poured into a farina-kettle. 
Add the wet arrt)wroot, and boil, stirring constantly until it is clear ; 
put in the milk, and cook ten minutes, stirring often. Oive while 
warm, adding hot milk should it l)e thicker than gruel. 

Arrowroot Blanc Mange.— One large cupful of boiling milk, 
one even t;d)lesj)oontul of arrowroot rubbed to a paste with cold water, 
two teas]ioonfuls of white sugar, a pinch of salt : tkivour with rose- 
water. Proceed as in the foregoing recipes, boiling and stirring eight 
minutes. Turn into a wet mould, and when firm, serve with cream 
and powdered sugar. 

Tapioca Jelly. — Soak a cupful of tapico in a quart of cold 
water, after washing it thoroughly two or three times ; after soaking

clear, stirring often; add the juice of a lemon, and a little of the 
grated peel, also a pinch of salt. Sweeten to taste. Other in- 
gredients can be substituted for lemon, if liked. 

Slippery-Elm Bark Tea. — Break the bark into bits, pour 
boiling water over it, cover, and let it infuse until cold. Sweeten, ice, 
and take for summer disorders, or add lemon juice and drink for a 
bad cold. 

Flax-Seed Tea. — Upon an (nmce of unbruised flax-seed and a 
little pulverised liquorice-root pcjur a pint of boiling ('soft or rain) 
water ; and place the vessel ccjntaining these ingredients near, but 
not on, the fire for four hours. Strain through a linen cloth. .Make it 
fresh every day. .Xn excellent drink in fever accompanied by a cough. 

Flax-Seed Lemonade. — To a large tablespoonful of rta.x-seed, 
allow a tumbler and a half of cold water. Boil them together till the 
liquid becomes very sticky. Then strain it hot over a quarter of a 
pound of pulverised sugar, and an ounce of pulverized gum arabic. 
Stir it till quite dissolved, and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon. 

This mixture has frecjuently been found an efllcacious remedy for a 
cold, taking a wine-ghib;? of it as often as the cough is troublesome. 

Tamarind Water. — I'ut tamarinds into a pitcher or tumbler 
till it is one-third full ; then till up with cold water, cover it, and let it 
infuse for a cjuarter of an hour or more. 

Currant jelly or cranberry juice mixed with water makes a pleasant 
drink for an insalid. 

Sago Jelly. — .Made the same as tapioca. If seasoning is not 
advisable, the sago may be boiled in milk, instead of water, and eaten 
plain. 

Rice jelly made the same, using only halt as much rice as sago. 

Hominy. — -Put to soak one pint of hominy in two and one-half 
pints of boiling water over night, in a tin vessel with a tight cover ; 
in the morning add one-half pint of sweet milk, and a little salt. 
Place on :. brisk fire in a kettle of boiling water, the tin vessel con- 
taining the hominy ; let boil one-half hour. 

Cracked wheat, oatmeal, muhh, are all good food for the sick. 

Chicken Jelly. — Cook a chicken in enough water to little 
more than cover it ; let it stew gently until the meat drops from the 
bones, and the broth is reduced to about a pint ; season it to taste, 
with a little salt and pepper. Strain and press, first through a 
colander, then through a coarse cloth. .Set it over the fire again, and 
cook a few minutes longer. Turn it into an earthen vegetable dish 
to harden ; set it on the ice in the refrigerator. Eat cold in slices. 
Nice made into sandwiches, with thin slices of bread, lightly spread 
with butter. 

Bo.ied Rice. — Boil half a cupful of rice in just enough water 
lo co\ci ii, with half a leaspouiiful of salt ; when the walei has boiled 
nearly out and the rice begins to look soft and dry, turn over it a 
cupful of milk, and let it simmer until the rice is done and nearly dry ; 
take from the fire and beat in a well-beaten egg. Eat it warm with 
cream and sugar. Flavour to taste.

add a gill of boiled milk, strain, and serve. This is an excellent 
broth for weak stomachs. 

Milk or Cream Codfish.— This dish will often relish when 
a person is recovering from sickness, when nothing else would. 
Pick up a large tablespoonful of salt codfish very fine ; freshen it 
considerably by placing it over the fire in a basin, ( overing it with 
cold water as it comes to a boil ; turn off the water and freshen again 
if very salt, then turn off the w ater until dry, and pour over half a

(Icj.'it's milk, 80 parts caseine, 40 sugar, 40 butter. 
Cow's milk, 63 parts caseine, 28 sugar, 40 butter. 
Human milk, 32 parts caseine, 26 sugar, 29 butter. 

Butter and sugar warm the system ; the caseine, representing the 
cheesy portion (jf milk, supplies strength and repairs the waste ; hence 
the young of animals, being obliged to use their limbs s(j much 
earlier than children, must have more caseine to repair the greater 
waste made by the necessity of a greater amount of effort needed for 
their out-door life and various necessities peculiar to their state and 
condition. 

Table VII.— NUTRIMENT AND FUEL. 

In the following table is given the proportion of nutriment and the 
prjportion of fuel in a given quantity of food : — 

Milk contains erne proportion of nutriment, 2 of fuel. 
Beans contain one projjortion of nutriment, 2A of fuel. 
Oatmeal contains one proportion of nutriment, 5 of fuel. 
Barley contains one proportion of nutriment, 7 of fuel. 
Wheat contains one proportion of nutriment, 8 of fuel. 
Potatoes contain one proportion of nutriment, 9 of fuel. 
Rice contains one proportion of nutriment, 10 of fuel. 
Arrowroot contains one proportion of nutriment, 26 of fuel. 
Tapioca contains one proportion of nutriment, 26 of fuel. 
.Sago contains one proportion of nutriment, 26 of fuel. 
Starch contains (jne proportion (jf nutriment, 40 of fuel. 

The last named articles are given to young children, because they re- 
quire a great deal of warmth, liut they need more than warmth ; if 
fed on these alone, they would soon die ; hence milk must be added 
to these, as it contains materials for growth and repair.

A nation as u-ell as the individual, should know how to use its food 
economically. This table is suggestive in that direction ; and it will 
interest the reader to compare the amount of nutriment contained in 
the different articles above named, making human milk the starting 
point ; thus a pound of mutton contains nearly as much nourishment 
as eight pounds of milk. The muscular strength of a nation <iepends 
upon the proper use and proportions of the various kinds of food eaten • 
and It has been well said that the political influence of a nation is as 
much dependent upon the muscular strength of the people as upon 
their intelligence and commercial activity. Englishmen and roast 
beef are synonyms ; and for centuries past the English nation has 
been the most powerful, the most influential, nation on the globe— a 
long-hved inte lectual, and powerful race as to the individufds com- 
posing It, founded on vigorous " health " as a result of "good living " 
The preceding table is only to be used for comparative purposes, as 
approximative, because other practical considerations would modify 
the result in any given case. But a table has been prepared by Di 
Letheby, one ..' .he most eminent men in the medical profession in 
Oreat Bntar , ■^; was communicated to the Society of Arts in one of 
the Cantoi Lectures," and may be considered as authentic To 
prepare such a table has reciuired an immense amount of labour and 
research ; it will be of permanent scientific and practical value, and 
reflects great credit on the indefatigable investigator.

heaUh on an amount of food which would yield a httle over 
liaif a pound of nutriment, not counting the water drunk or the 
air l)reathed. 

Dr. Edward Smith, of London, says that the amounts required for 
sustaining health are, for a. 

Grains of Carbon. Grains of N'itrogen. 
Adult wor.an, 3900 180 

Adult man, 43CX) 200-

These proportions would be obtained in alxjut two and a ijuarter 
pounds of good wheat bread. On this foundation the following interest-

Much lias Ijeen said of the superior healthfulness of l)ro\\ n breatl 
over while, and still the masses will use the whitest flour they can get. 
The writer knows a \ery wealthy owner of flour-mills who, from 
principle, uses bran bread on his family table, but supplies the whitest 
flour to his servants, otherwise they w i not live with him a week. 
Is the instinct of the servant nearer . f;ht than the intellect of the 
master ? 

From the above table it will be seen tliat a bushel of Ijran has 
nearly seven times as much mineral matter as a bushel of fine flour. 
It is this mineral matter which mainly i^ives strength to the bones, 
and beai'ty and lastingness to the teeth, and vigour to the brain, and 
power to the muscles ; that is, this mineral matter, or " ash,"' utilizes 
the nilrcjgen ami the i.aibon deii\ ed from our food. IKil un estigalion 
shows that half of the bran is indigestible, even if passed through half 
a dozen .'"'iMals m succession ; secondly, it is so irritating, by its 
jagged |)oints coming in contact with the delicate coating of the 
bowels, that it forces the food through the alimentary canal in healthy

persons before it is fully digested, hence causes waste. Hence, as 
was said in a previous page, it is beneficial Kj those whose bowels are 
too slow, ( onstijiated ; and the caution was there given that, when 
taken to remove constipation, it should be discontinued when the 
desired result was secured, thus having something to fall back uj)on 
in case of fmther need in that direction. 

Hence working and observing men seem instinctively to have 
chosen the whitest bread, as more easily digested and as giving more 
strength to work. A middle course would seem, in the present state 
of our knowledge, to be the most desirable — neither to use the finest 
flour nor the whole product of the grain known as seconds flour, which 
should contain eighty per cent, of the whole grain. It has been said 
that the very outer skin has been removed, thus yielding eighty-eight 
per cent, of the grain, excluding only the perfectly indigestible portion 

Good Bread. 

One other reliable fact may here be stated in reference to wheat 
bread, as it is on every table. One hundred pounds of flour will make 
one hundred and thirty-three and one-third pounds of bread ; that is, 
out of three hundred pounds of flour, our baker sells us four hundred' 
pounds (jf bread. Hut he is not satisfied until he adds one-third to 
that profit, by either jjutting in some alum, which, while it whitens the 
loaf, makes it capable of holding one-third more water. Or, if three 
or four pounds of rice are boiled three hours in three gallons of water, 
and this is mixed with the flour in the dough, a large increase of 
weight is added to the bread. To make good bread, thirty-seven per 
cent of water should be added to the flour ; that is, sixty-three pounds 
of flour and thirtv-seven of water.
