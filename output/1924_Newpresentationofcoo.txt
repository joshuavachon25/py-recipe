Why This Book Has Been Written 

With our present highly complex civilization in America, the 
modern woman has many calls on her time. Much as she might 
desire in preparing food to work out her own recipes, as her 
grandmother did, she cannot afford to take the time from other 
equally important activities. 

During the past few years there has been an enormous in- 
crease in the number and variety of foods and dishes on the 
American table. This makes the selection for a given meal a dif- 
ficult task. It is simple, however, to decide on the time to be set 
aside for the cooking of the meal. 

In order to simplify the work of the housewife, we have 
adopted an entirely new method of compiling recipes. For as 
many dishes as was possible, we have divided the recipes accord- 
ing to the time necessary for their preparation and cooking. And 
we have made a specialty of recipes for dishes which can be pre- 
pared and cooked in 15 minutes, in 30 minutes, and in 45 minutes. 

For the woman who likes to collect new recipes, we have in- 
corporated in this book certain charts and formulae giving the 
fundamentals of proportions which will not only enable her to 
verify these recipes, but to develop new ones of her own. We 
have also left blank pages at the end of the book for her con- 
venience. We have devoted unusual space to Bread, Pastry and 
Preserving, because most cook-books, unfortunately, are inade- 
quate in these three branches of cooking. 

A good cook is one who can make food so palatable that any 
one will enjoy it. But to be a good cook it is necessary to know 
the fundamentals of food products and of cooking. We strongly 
recommend, therefore, that the housewife familiarize herself with 
the charts, general information and practical hints to be found in 
this book. She will find that her work grows less difficult as she 
gains in knowledge of the fundamentals of cooking. 

Good cooking is creative. It means not only the creation of 
edible dishes, but the re-creation of men, women and children. 
It is an art. And because it is the most useful and the most nec- 
essary, it is the greatest of all arts. 

Cooking is more than an art ; it is a science. And because it is 
a science, we have been able to reduce the; complicated recipes of 
our grandmothers' day to simple, easily prepared and more 
easily understood principles, and to add many more recipes of 
which our grandmothers knew nothing. 

The experience of thirty years in the theory and practice of 
food preparation has gone into the writing of this book. During 
that time we have studied many books, pamphlets, notes, reports 
and statistics. To their authors we make grateful acknowledg- 
ment. 

We have condensed our information into a form which will 
be readily understood. If intelHgently and properly used, this 
book with its time and labor saving devices will be of real use in 
solving one of the biggest problems of the housewife of the 
present day.

AUGUSTE GAY 



The Author of the Book 

Mr. Auguste Gay, the author of this book, is peculiarly fitted 
by virtue of his training and experience to place before the house- 
wives of America the best, most palatable, most wholesome and 
most easily and economically prepared dishes that the increas- 
ingly high standard of American living demands. 

Mr. Gay was educated in medicine and dietetics in Paris, 
where he was born. He has traveled extensively in different 
countries all over the world, and during his travels made an ex- 
haustive study of food products, their characteristics and nutri- 
tive properties, and of food chemistry. He is one of the foremost 
authorities in the United States on these matters and on cuisine. 
He is a consulting expert and lecturer on food, nutrition, cooking 
and home economics. His recognized ability won him the cov- 
eted position of Chairman of the Jury in two Culinary Exhibi- 
tions in Montreal and two in New York. 

That Mr. Gay is recognized as an authority on American cook- 
ing is shown by the fact that he was requested to work in an ad- 
visory capacity with the Food Administration during the war. 
He is the man who won the prize offered by the Food Adminis- 
tration for the best war time bread. His bread was later popu- 
larly known as the Liberty Bread. 

When the United States in 1917 was faced with the problem 
of a large army to feed and no available cooks, Mr. Gay was 
made Chairman of the Examining Board of U. S. Army Cooks 
for New York City. In two months he examined over 3000 cooks 
for the army. He was then made Instructor of Military Cooking 
at Columbia University in New York City. 

It can easily be seen that Mr. Gay has had unusual experience. 
He believes in simple dishes which are wholesome and easily 
cooked. This is not because he does not know the more com- 
plicated ones — he has invented many of them himself. He has 
had charge of the cuisine and the training of chefs in many of 
the best known hotels all over the world.* 

As an expert Mr. Gay recommends simple dishes which are 
easy of preparation. And he has an extraordinary knowledge of 
how to save time and trouble. His unusual recipes are always 
easily understood and easily prepared. They are without frills. 

* Some of the better known places in which Mr. Gay supervised the cuisine are: 
The Duke of Wellington's House, London, England; Grand Hotel, Brussels, Belgium; 
Bristol Hotel, Vienna, Austria: Czar of Russia, Petrograd, Russia; the French Em- 
bassies in Moscow, Russia, and Constantinople, Turkey; Sheppard's Hotel, Cairo, 
Egypt; Grand Hotel, Rome, Italy; Continontal Hotel, Paris, Prance; the Ritz Carlton 
Hotels in New York City and Montreal; and the Yale Club in New York City. While 
he was in New York, he was the President of the Chefs de Cuisine Association of 
America. 



He knows the difficulties connected with the preparation of foods 
in the home, and wishes to place the knowledge he has gained 
through thirty years of experience at the disposal of the American 
housewife. 

Mr. Gay's recognized experience and ability have ideally fitted 
him to work out my long cherished idea of providing the Ameri- 
can housewife with timed recipes to simplify her work. It has 
been a great pleasure to be associated with Mr. Gay in the con- 
summation of this plan, especially as his recipes, charts and gen- 
eral information have made the book invaluable to the house- 
wives for whom it was intended.

Food and Nutrition Knowledge 

Food consists of the articles of animal or vegetable origin which form the 
diet of man, and is anything which nourishes the body, including water. 

The human body is a self building, self repairing, self regulating machine. 
Give it proper food and it will run itself. 

All the tissues and organs of the body are made up of microscopic living 
cells, each of which feeds and repairs itself from the food which is brought 
to it by the blood, and receives the energy for its work from the heat caused 
by the housing of this food in the cells. 

The heat or energy produced by the digestion of food is measured in 
calories. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature 
of 1 pound of water 4 degrees F. 

The human body uses about one-third of its energy for muscular work and 
the other two-thirds in maintaining the body heat. 

To live man requires certain substances called food principles. They are: 

Water 

Mineral Matter 

Protein 

Carbohydrates and Fats 

Vitamines 
WATER. Water is a vital foodstuff. It makes up about two-thirds of the 
whole weight of the human body and keeps it in good working condition. It 
helps the body to eliminate its waste material. Water forms the largest part of 
most food material. It is abundant in fruits and vegetables, but is insufficient 
in these alone to supply the needs of the body. Additional water to drink, 
therefore, is necessary to the body's upkeep. 

MINERAL MATTER. Mineral matter builds bones and tissues and 
increases the production of blood. It is found in all animal and vegetable 
food in varying quantities. 

PROTEINS. The proteins build new muscles and flesh and do the repair- 
ing work in worn out parts. They come chiefly from eggs, milk, fish, meat, 
peas, beans, cereals, cheese, etc. 

CARBOHYDRATES AND FATS. The carbohydrates and fats are 
burned in the body to furnish heat and energy. The carbohydrates furnish 
energy and heat, while the fats and oils store up energy and heat to be used 
later as needed by the body. The two most essential carbohydrates are starch 
and sugar. They are found in vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals and grains, 
bread, sugar, syrup, jam, etc. We get our fats chiefly from fats of meats, oils, 
nuts, milk, cream, butter and olives. 

VITAMINES. Vitamines are food adjuncts necessary to maintain life, 
promote growth, and protect the body from various diseases. Lack of them 
in the diet tends to interfere with growth and break down health. There are 
three of these vitamines, as follows: 



FOOD AND NUTRITION KNOWLEDGE 



Vitamine A — is usually found in foods showing a yellow or green 
color and in fats, meats, fish, butter, cheese, etc. 

Vitamine B — is found in most fruits, green vegetables and grains. 

Vitamine C — is found in many raw foods, principally in acid foods. 

Vitamines are destroyed (especially Vitamine C) by high temperature. 
Vitamines, therefore, are destroyed in all canned foodstuffs, exception being 
made in the case of tomatoes which retain some of their Vitamine C principle 
after long heating. It will readily be seen that fresh vegetables are much 
healthier and more nourishing than canned. 

To be healthy, well, strong and happy we must have some of all of these 
different kinds of foods daily. (See tables on pages 22 and 23.) 



What Food Must Do: 

Keep the blood in good condition. 
Give energy to the body for work. 
Make the body strong. 
Keep the body in good condition. 
Build and repair the body. 



Reasons for Cooking Food: 

To develop or change the flavor of foods. 

To destroy germ.s producing diseases which may be present. 

To prevent food from spoiling quickly. 

To make food easier to digest. 

To make food easier to chew. 

To make food more attractive. 

To add variety in ways of serving food. 



Principles of Cooking 



Cookery or cooking is the art of preparing food for the nourishment of the 
body. 

Cooking should be an essential branch of the education of man or woman. 

Every precaution should be taken to insure cleanliness in cooking food. 
This is important not only to avoid pollution, but also to prevent the possible 
transmission of disease. 

The pricipal cooking methods used are classified and described as follows : 

BAKING — is cooking in an enclosed space with confined heat, as in the 
oven. We bake bread, cakes, fish, meats, special entrees, vegetables, pud- 
dings etc. 

BOILING — is cooking by immersion in boiling water. We boil meats, 
vegetables, fruits, cereals, poultry, fish, eggs, etc. Steeping, Percolating, 
Infusing, are special processes related to boiling and are employed in the 
making of tea, beverages, cofifee. Coddling is the immersion of food in boil- 
ing hot water which is allowed to cool gradually without further application 
of heat. We coddle eggs, berries, tender vegetables. 



FOOD AND NUTRITION KNOWLEDGE 



BRAISING — is cooking by stewing and baking combined. We braise large 
pieces of meat, poultry, fish and some vegetables requiring long cooking 
and slow absorption of added juices and ingredients. This is an economical 
way of cooking and produces the most easily digested dishes. Casserole or 
escalloped cooking is a form of braising. 

BROILING or GRILLING — is cooking under, in front of, or over direct 
heat or fire. We broil, or grill, meat, fish, poultry, vegetables. When bread 
or similar food is thus treated, it is termed toasting. 

FRYING — is cooking by immersion in hot fat or oil or by contact with 
hot fat or oil. We fry meat, fish, vegetables, eggs, batters, croquettes, dough- 
nuts, etc. 

ROASTING — is cooking in front of a fire or in an oven. When food is 
roasted in the oven, a small amount of water should be added. The liquid 
so formed is used for basting the food from time to time. We roast meat, 
poultry, fish and a few vegetables. 

SAUTEING — is cooking by frying in a small amount of fat, generally by 
the use of a frying pan or griddle. The fqod is cooked on one side, turned, 
and cooked on the other. We saute fish, meat, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, 
etc. 

SIMMERING — is cooking in a liquid at such temperature that after the 
boiling point has been reached the bubbles should always be below the sur- 
face. We simmer ham, dry beans, some soups, corned beef, tongue, etc. 

STEAMING — is cooking over boiling water or in live steam in some special 
device, of which a double boiler is the most common. The food is placed in 
a container which in turn is partly immersed in constantly boiling water or 
live steam. We steam puddings, some kinds of breads, cereals, fruits, veg- 
etables, fish, etc. 

STEWING — is cooking by means of a very small amount of boiling liquid 
at a low temperature until the food is tender. By stewing all the nutriment 
is retained in the food and in the food juices. We stew meats, fish, poultry, 
vegetables and fruits. 

Lately a new method of cooking, by fireless cooker has been resorted to. 
The food is placed in insulated air spaces and cooked by the retained heat 
supplied by hot stones, hot iron plates or some similar means. The results so 
far of this method of cooking are not very satisfactory. 

Advice in Cooking 

Before thinking about recipes, think whether you are really ready to 
work. 

BEFORE COOKING 

Wear a clean apron. 

Have a clean hand towel. 

Wash the hands and clean finger nails. 

Think out a list of utensils needed and get these out first. 



FOOD AND NUTRITION KNOWLEDGE 



WHILE COOKING 

Read directions or recipes. 

Carry materials which will spill with a pan under them. 

into it. Never lay them on the table. 
In tasting food always use a tablespoon. 
In measuring, level with flat side of the knife. 
Measure over a plate or tin. 
Sift flour or floury material before measuring. 

WHEN COOKING IS DONE 

Pile and scrape all utensils. 

All utensils must be rinsed and washed at the first minute possible. 

Put back everything in place. 

Thrift in Cooking 

Be proud to be known as a thrifty cook. 
Make saving, rather than spending, your social standard. 
In your own mind try to answer these questions — they will help you to 
save money and food: 

Do you store your food in such a way that it never spoils? 

Are you using more foodstuffs than you need? 

Are you wasting any food? 

Are you using some cheap substitute for expensive foods? 

Do you let cooked leftovers spoil? 

Do you save and use all meat trimmings, bones and fat? 

Do you pare vegetables or fruits carefully so as not to waste? 

Do you scrape out mixing bowls, stew pans and sauce pans 

thoroughly ? 
Do you try to use even the last quarter cup of your milk? 
Free yourself from food prejudice. Cease to say "don't like" or "can't eat." 
Try to eat it and get used to it. 

Train yourself to thrift in cooking and tell others of your successes in 
doing so. 

Vegetables and fruits are savers of some other foods in a menu. For 
example : 

MEAT SAVERS 
peas 
corn 
Beans (Lima-Boston) 

CEREAL SAVERS 
potatoes 
fruits 

SUGAR SAVERS 
beets 
corn 

sweet potatoes 
all fruits 



FOOD AND NUTRITION KNOWLEDGE 



Good Food Habits 

Eat slowly. 

Chew thoroughly. 

Drink milk or eat dishes prepared with milk. 

Do not eat when excited or in a hurry. He who has no time to eat has no 
time to live. Be happy while eating. 

Quiet aids digestion. 

Drink 5 to 6 glasses of water every day. 

Eat meals at regular times. 

Eat some vegetable other than potatoes each day. 

Eat some fruit each day. 

Candy and other rich sweets when eaten between meals spoil the appetite 
for the necessary food for the next meal. 



Meal Planning 



Every woman who cooks for a family should know how to select and 
prepare the right foods in the right amount. 

A well planned meal, or correct diet, should include in the meals of each 
day foods which will build up the body, repair any worn out parts, and provide 
heat and energy. If this is accomplished, the body will be in good working 
order. 

Efiective meal planning can be done by following only a few rules. 

If there are children in the family, serve milk or milk dishes every day. 

Provide a variety of fresh, dried, or cooked fruits at least once a day. 

Give the family simple meals, made up of a few, but varied dishes. 

For every meal, breakfast excepted, serve two different kinds of raw or 
cooked vegetables. 

Give the children plenty of bread, butter, eggs, vegetables, fruits and a 
little meat. Have also at least once a day some simple sweets. 

Serve a fruit at breakfast for children or adults, and if practical serve a 
soup at dinner. 

Many housewives feel that persons doing heavy outdoor manual work, 
require much meat in their diet. This is not true. A well balanced meal 
will give all that is required by the body. 

To insure variety in the meal, if the housewife doubts her ability to give 
her family the right diet, she should consult cook books, booklets, or any 
literature, such as circulars or m.agazines. They will be of great help. 

The meals of the day should be planned in such a way that they meet the 
needs of the several members of the family. 

The greater part of the meal should be simply prepared and easily 
digested. Sweets, desserts, cakes, candies are very desirable foods, but 
should be used in small quantities. 

When possible, begin breakfast with a fruit, dinner with a soup — they stim- 
ulate the flow of the digestive juices. 

Meals should be planned so that there will not be a sameness of flavor, form 
or texture. For instance, do not serve at the same meal potato soup and 
•Dotato salad, or several dishes with onions. 

Try to serve a moist food with a dry food, or crisp food with a soft food. 

Remember that in the summer the body requires less food than in the 
winter. 



MEAL PLANNING 



Keep a balance between the different courses in the meal. Serve a light 
dessert after a heavy course and vice versa. 

All legumes except a few are deficient in fat and should have it added in 
some form. 

Never give tea or coffee to children. 

Remember also that water is a food. 

Meals should be served at regular times. 

The meals are named below in the order in which they are eaten : 

Breakfast 
Lunch 
Dinner 
Supper 

Breakfast is the first meal taken in the morning. 

Lunch is the meal taken at noon. 

Dinner is the meal served in the early evening. 

Supper is the meal served late in the evening. 

This little chart is made to suit a family consisting of children and adults : 

BREAKFAST 

Fruit — any kind or form 

Cereal 

Eggs, or creamed fish or meat 

Bread and butter 

Beverage 

LUNCH 

Meat or fish 

Vegetables, including a potato 

Salad 

Bread and butter 

Dessert 

Beverage 

DINNER 

Soup 

Hot dish 

Vegetables or Salad 

Fruit 

Bread and butter 

Beverage 



/ 

MEAL PLANNING 



SUPPER 

Hot or cold dish 
Salad 
Dessert 
Beverage 

Any variety of dishes will have the desired effect on the nutrition of the 
family so long as they contain one food of each group of foods. (See chart 
on p. 22.) 

Feeding of Children (5 to 10 years) 

Children must receive proper food every day. Proper feeding has a tre- 
mendous influence on their growth and health. 

Improper feeding takes some time to show its bad results, but in later 
years the child will develop symptoms which are derived from improper 
feeding. 

Proper feeding, plenty of fresh air and wholesome exercise are the most 
important factors in the nutrition of children. 

Milk, if possible, should be given at each meal as a bcyerage. Very few 
children dislike milk. 

Fruit juices, cooked or raw, must be served quite frequently. 

Hot cocoa is a very good beverage for children, as is also milk shake. 

Milk, eggs, well cooked vegetables produce better growth than meat in 
childhood. 

Well cooked cereals are a very good foundation for body building in 
children. Change the form of preparation often to insure variety. 

Water should be given frequently between meals to children. 

Tea and coffee should be forbidden children. 

Bread or toast eaten by children teach proper mastication and strengthen* 
jaws and teeth. 

As the child grows older, increase the amount of butter in its diet. 

Fruits and fruit juices keep the blooc^ in good condition, and also prevent 
constipation. Three tablespoons of fruit juice given at breakfast give good 
results. 

Teach your children to eat any food, but always the right kind. This 
ought to be a fundamental and most important part of their education. 

Jams and marmalades are relished by children. They are very good food 
for children, but should not be given too frequently. 



MEAL PLANNING 



Sandwiches are always appealing to children. Vary as much as possible 
their fillings (jelly, chopped eggs, lettuce leaves, cheese or a mixture of 
chopped fruit with butter). 

A good breakfast is the start of the digestive function. 

Never send to school a child who refuses to eat its breakfast. Disturbance 
of some sort is in sight. 

When a child reaches the age of six years, his food habits, if properly 
regulated, should be well established. 

Poorly chosen food or too little food is the greatest enemy of the child, 
while overfeeding is only a danger for the stomach and digestive organs of 
the child. 

Teach your child to chew and eat slowly, and to empty his mouth en- 
tirely before drinking. 

Suggested Menu for Children (5 to 10 years) 

BREAKFAST : 

1 glass milk or 1 cup cocoa 

Yz cup stewed fruit or 1 whole fruit 

1 cup of well cooked cereal 

2 slices of bread with butter, or 

2 slices of toast with jam or jelly 

LUNCH : 

1 or 2 glasses of milk 

Yi cup of cooked vegetables 

1 potato or more 

some kind of hot dish 

dessert of some kind — baked apple, pudding, cake, ice cream, 
cookies, etc. 

2 to 3 slices bread with butter 

DINNER 

1 or 2 glasses of milk 
1 cup hot soup 
egg, meat or fish 
vegetable, cooked 
light dessert — fruit most desirable 
1 or two slices of bread 
Let children drink water during and between their meals. 

Meal Planning for Old People 

When people grow older, unavoidable changes occur in the circulatory 
and digestive organs of their bodies. 

The effect of food on the body is less active, and there is no muscle build- 
ing or growth process. Elimination of waste is also retarded. 



10 MEAL PLANNING 



No general rule on the feeding of old people can be given, as it varies 
with every individual. 

But it is safe to say that good results are obtained by following a few 
principles of feeding, as follows : 

Use food in small quantities, but at regular intervals. 

Diminish the amount of food to be eaten. 

Simple foods and light foods are the best suited for old people. 

Decrease the amount of muscle building food. 

Milk, except where there is stomach disturbance, is a good food for old 
people. 



Practical Hints 

Marketing 

Do not mistake cheapness for economy. 

The use of a telephone is not economical in marketing. 

Marketing can only be done in person. 

The amount of food necessary for the family may not be calculated 
exactly at first, but experience will teach. 

Intelligent marketing, careful preparation and cooking are tasks worthy 
of any woman. 

Do not buy ready to eat foods for the main course of meals. They are 
expensive. 

Do not buy for appearance only — a large red apple may not be as good as 
a small green one. 

Bear in mind that a liquid pint is not the same as a dry pint. 

Buy in definite quantity : So many pounds, so many ounces. Do not buy 
a dime's worth or a quarter's worth. 

When buying foodstuffs in packed, bottled, or canned form, remember 
that there is a Federal law requiring that the net contents be marked on the 
package. Look out for this mark and you can tell just how much you are 
buying. 

Eggs 

A hen egg should weigh 2 ounces. 

A good egg should be full and transparent in the light. 

Place the large end of an egg against the cheek; if the egg is fresh, a sen- 
sation of warmth is felt. 

Place egg in water v/ith a little salt. If the egg goes to the bottom, it is 
fresh. If it stays in the middle of the water, it is 2 or 3 days old. But if it 
floats, it is 5 or more days old. This does not apply to cold storage eggs. 

Fish 

Fish have seasons, just as do vegetables and fruits. Study the seasons 
and learn to buy when the run is on. 

As a rule women hesitate to purchase an unknown kind of fish. The only 
fear they have is that they may not like it. All fish sold on the market are 
subject to certain regulations which protect the consumer. 

Put your fish in water. It it sinks, it is fresh. If it floats, it should not 
be used. 

In buying fish, look first to see that the flesh is firm. 



12 PRACTICAL HINTS 



Fish is fresh if the gills and eyes are bright. 

How to Select Lobsters. Try to buy live lobsters, not the boiled ones. 
If it is unavoidable for you to buy a boiled lobster, ascertain its condition by 
pressing the tail outward. If it is elastic and when released flies back in- 
stantly to its first position, the lobster was alive when put on to boil. 

Meat 

How to Tell Good Beef. The best beef comes from the steer. Cow and 
bull meat are not as choice. Beef of a good grade has thick lean meat, which 
should be firm and elastic and quite even in texture. It should be medium 
red and mottled throughout with fat of a creamy color. The outer fat should 
be thick, smooth, firm, and also of a creamy color. 

How to Tell Good Veal. Veal is of course )^oung beef. The meat, there- 
fore, is of a lighter color than that of beef, being nearer pink than red, and 
is less firm. The fat, instead of being cream color, is quite white. Remember 
that the meat of veal should never be colorless. Veal is a bland meat and 
has little fat. Added fat, such as bacon, pork, or butter, should be used in 
cooking veal. 

How to Tell Good Lamb and Mutton. The difference between lamb and 
mutton is merely that of age, lamb being young mutton. The meat of mutton 
is a dull brick red, and that of lamb is considerably lighter. Both lamb and 
mutton should have fine grained lean meat and white, hard, flaky fat. The 
lamb bone is quite red, while that of mutton is quite white. Good grade lamb 
and mutton have a large amount of fat and a small amount of bone. The 
usual objection to mutton is the "muttony" taste. This comes from the 
"fell," a reddish membrane covering the surface of the body. It contains 
a certain amount of odorous oil from the wool and should always be removed 
before cooking. If this is done, the so-called "muttony" flavor can be avoided, 
and mutton can be made as delicious as lamb. Bacon or a small amount of 
onions or garlic used in cooking mutton will completely do away with the 
"muttony" taste. 

How to Tell Good Pork. The lean of pork is of a dark pink and the fat 
is of a translucent white and not very firm. Good grade pork should have 
a large proportion of fat. This is also true o£ ham and bacon, both being pork 
products. 

All Good Meat Is Firm, Elastic, And Smells Fresh. 



PRACTICAL HINTS 13 



Poultry 

Terms Used in Selecting Poultry or Fowl 
Broilers. Fowls under ten months. 
Pullet. Young fowl up to the age of one year. 
Chicken. Fowl under ten months. 
Fowl. All poultry above one year. 
Capon. Fattened male chicken. 

How to Tell Good Poultry : 

The end of the breastbone must be flexible. 

The feet must be soft and smooth. 

The flesh must be smooth. 

The claws and feet are usually light yellow. 

A growth of much hair over the carcass is an indication of age in poultry. 

The flesh of old poultry (turkeys and chicken) shows a purplish color 
under the skin of the back and legs. 

Young geese and ducks have white soft feet and tender wings. 

In ducks the fat should be semi-transparent and light. The windpipe 
should break when pressed between the thumb and forefiinger. 

Vegetables 

A perishable vegetable should be used as soon as purchased. 

Fresh vegetables should be sound and whole when purchased. 

Ends of carrots, tomatoes, celery, furnish flavor without added cost. 

In vegetables the next best flavor to onion is celery. 

Parings and bits of vegetables may be utilized for flavoring if clean. 

A good rule in boiling vegetables is never to cover them. 

In cooking vegetables, salt the water first, bring to a boil, and then put 
in the vegetables. 

To Boil Peas Tender. Boil the peas in plenty of salted water in which 
they can play about. Do not put the lid or cover on the utensil in which they 
are cooking. 

To Peel Onions. Peel the onions with a sharp knife under water. This 
will save tears. 

If, after peeling onions, your hands retain the obnoxious odor, rub in dry 
salt and wash off in cold water. Do not use hot water and soap. 



14 PRACTICAL HINTS 



How to Select Good Vegetables

filled and highly colored pods. 

Peppers must be medium and uniform in size, dark green, and with 
thick flesh. 

Potatoes must be medium sized and uniform, w-ith firm and smooth skin, 
white interior and mealy texture. 

Pumpkin, must be of medium size, highly colored, thick in flesh, and with 
small seed cavity. 

Radish must be small or medium, highly colored, crisp, and mild in flavor. 



PRACTICAL HINTS 15 



Spinach must be tender, with medium sized leaves, green in color, and as 
clean as possible. 

Squash must be solid, of small size, and with small seed cavity. 

Tomatoes must be dark red in color, solid, with small seed cavity, flesh 
and skin smooth. Large tomatoes are only show vegetables. 

Turnips must be medium large, sweet, with flesh a little fibrous. 



How to Tell Good Mushrooms 

Contrary to the common belief, most mushrooms are not poisonous. Few 
mushrooms are extremely poisonous; a large number are slightly poisonous; 
and a great number can be used as food. 

Unfortunately there is no reliable test to distinguish poisonous from 
edible mushrooms. 

The well known silver coin test is unreliable, as both poisonous and edible 
mushrooms have the same reaction on the silver. 

Another test commonly practiced consists of peeling oflf the upper skin 
from a mushroom. If this can be done, the mushroom is considered edible. 
Poisonous mushrooms, however, can be peeled in the same manner. 

In trying to distinguish poisonous from non-poisonous mushrooms, there 
are a few suggestions which can be followed. If these suggestions are ad- 
hered to, there is small chance of poisoning. 

In selecting mushrooms: 

Avoid all mushrooms in the "button" or young stage. At this time of 
their growth, it is impossible to determine good mushrooms from bad ones. 

Avoid mushrooms with pores on the under side of the cap. 

Avoid mushrooms which have white spores, a ring, and a bulblike base 
all on the same mushroom. 

Avoid mushrooms having a white, milky juice. If milk or juice is red, 
the mushrooms are edible. 

Avoid mushrooms having a cap which is thin in comparison with the gills, 
gills. 

Avoid mushrooms of a bright color and in which the gills are of equal 
length. 

Avoid mushrooms which are not strictly fresh. Decay greatly increases 
the production of poisonous substances. 



16 PRACTICAL HINTS 



Kitchen Stoves 

Gas Stove 

To light gas stove turn on the gas and let gas escape through burner 
for an instant, and then apply a lighted match. 

In lighting a gas oven or broiler it is most important to open the doors 
before lighting, to permit any accumulation of gas to escape, thus preventing 
an explosion. 

To clean a gas stove use boiling water and soap. 

If the burners are stopped up, remove them and boil them in water with 
one tablespoon of washing soda for every quart of water. 

Never apply stove polish or blacking to gas burner. 

Coal Stove 

Before starting any fire in a coal stove, fire box and ash pan should be 
emptied and cleared. 

To start fire crumple paper and place in fire box, then lay on kindling 
wood. Open chimney damper. Put the lids on tight. Apply lighted match. 
When fire has started, add coal a little at a time until heat is well distributed. 

To clean coal stove the best time is when the stove is still a little warm. 
Apply hot water and soap, and dry with crumpled paper. When stove has 
cooled, apply with a rag a little cottonseed oil or stove polish. 

Oil Stove 

Keep oil stove as clean as possible to avoid objectionable odor. 

Never fill oil stove while burning. 

Wicks should be trimmed even, and when lighted th^y should be turned 
down until the flame is blue. 

Never use a funnel to fill stove, as it is hard to see how much oil is being 
poured. 

The burners should be boiled in soapy water from time to time. 

The outside of the stove and the chimneys should also be cleaned with 
boiling soapy water. 

Boiling of Water 

In cooking the terms "boiling water" or "boil the water" are frequently 
used. The housewife sometimes thinks that the water is boiling when, un- 
fortunately, the boiling point has not been reached. These suggestions will 
probably help her to understand the term boiling: 

When water is placed in a pan and heated and the bubbles stick to the 
bottom of the pan, the temperature is around 160° F. 



PRACTICAL HINTS 1? 



When the bubbles rise to the top, the temperature is around 180° F. 

When the water starts to move slowly about the pan, the temperature is 
around 200° F. 

When the water jumps and tries to get out of the pan, the temperature is 
around 211° F to 212° F. 

212° F is the exact temperature of the boiling point. 

All these temperatures are from sea level to 1000 feet above sea level. 

Practical Ways of Testing An Oven 

Moderate Oven 

1. You should be able to hold your hand in the center of the oven 25 
seconds, or 

2. Place a piece of light wrapping paper in your oven and it should be- 
come brown in 5 minutes. 

Hot Oven 

1. You can scarcely hold your hand in the center of the oven for 15 
seconds, or 

2. Place a piece of light wrapping paper in your oven and it will become 
brown in 3 minutes. 

Testing Fats 

For uncooked food, deep fat is just hot enough if a piece of bread will 
brown in it in 60 seconds. 

For cooked food, deep fat is just hot enough if a piece of bread will brown 
in it in 40 seconds. 

Fat is nearly burning when it smokes; therefore take smoking fat off the 
fire and cool before frying in it any food material. 

Dish Washing 

Soak utensils to which food sticks. 

Have two pans, one with hot soapy water, and the other with scalding 
water for rinsing. 

In washing, arrange so that the clean dishes will be placed on the side 
nearest the cupboard. 

After dishwashing is done, rinse out the dish towel and dish cloths, leav- 
ing them spotlessly clean.

Charts and Tables 



This section consists of information of value to the housewife condensed 
into charts and tables which make for convenience. 

The table of kitchen utensils is a list of all the utensils necessary in the 
ordinary kitchen. No recipe in this book calls for the use of any utensil 
not given in this list. 

In order to help the housewife to ascertain the health or energy giving 
properties of foods, there are charts and tables giving the vitamine contents 
of our more common foods, foods grouped according to their functions and 
uses in the body, and the food equivalents in energy to one glass of milk. 

As aids in cooking there are a table of measures, a table of oven temper- 
atures, a time table for baking, the divisions of time in baking, a table for 
cooking cereals, a table of equivalents to one cup of butter in cooking, and 
a conversion table for cooking at high altitudes. 

The set of charts showing the seasons for Fish, Fruit, Game, Meat, Poul- 
try and Vegetables will be found particularly useful. Foods are of course 
least expensive when in season. Reference to these charts will, therefore, be 
of service in economical buying. 

Probably the most useful and the most important chart in this section is 
the Cooking Guide. It contains 280 different foods, with information as to 
their size or weight, preparation, method of cooking and time for cooking. 
It may be used as a means for suggesting new or varied dishes in the daily 
menu, as a reminder of the length of time to cook any food, as a substitute 
for a recipe, and in many other ways.

COOKING AT HIGH ALTITUDES 

The chief difficulty in cooking at high altitudes is in the boiling of water to cook foods. 
The decrease in atmospheric pressure lowers the boiling point, aJlowing the water to boil at 
too low a temperature for convenient cooking. The decrease amounts roughly to 1 degree for 
every 555 feet of ascent above sea level. Thus, although the boiling temperature of water 
at sea level is 212 degrees F., at 7,000 feet elevation the temperature of boiling water is only 
200 degrees F., a difference of 12 degrees. 

In order to cook foods by boiling at high altitudes it is necessary to increase the density 
of the pressure of the water. This can be done by adding to every quart of water used in 
cooking 1 tablespoon of salt and 3 cups of water. The following table may be used where 1 
quart of water would ordinarily be used in cooking the food. Where 2 quarts of water would 
be used, double the additions of salt and water; for 3 quarts, triple the amount, etc.

Other methods of cooking are not particularly affected by high altitudes. However, there 
are a few suggestions which can be made, as follows: 

In canning at an altitude more than 1,000 feet above sea level, the time for the hot water 
bath should be increased 10 per cent for each 500 feet above the 1,000 foot level. 

In making cake at an altitude more than 1,500 feet above sea level, it Is advisable to 
use a little more flour, egg; 

use a little less baking powder, sugar, shortening, butter; 
bake with a tittle less heat. 
The time for baking remains about the same ae for lower altitudes.

General Recipes 



There are a number of recipes, such as dressings, sauces and stuffings, 
which are used with a variety of different dishes. In order to save space and 
to avoid constant repetition, these recipes are included in this section and 
are referred to in other sections of this book in the recipes for dishes with 
which they are used. This section of general recipes includes recipes for 
dressings, sauces, stuffings, the six basic methods of cooking eggs, etc. 

BREAD STUFFING 

54 cup of fat or bacon, cut in small pieces 
5^ onion (small), cut in cubes 
2 cups bread crumbs 

y2 teaspoon salt 

y\ teaspoon pepper 

54 teaspoon sage 

1 small bay leaf 

54 cup boiling water 

Melt fat, add onion and bread. Stir until crumbs begin to brown, then 
add seasonings and boiling water. Let cool oflt' before using. Chicken liver 
passed through a strainer may be added when stuffing is cold. 

FISH STUFFING 

2 tablespoons onion, chopped 

1 tablespoon parsley, chopped 

2 cups bread crumbs 
54 cup butter, melted 

1 cup water 

1 egg 

salt and pepper to taste 

Soak bread crumbs in water for 5 minutes. Drain off water and add other 
ingredients, mixing well. Use as a stuffing for large fish to be baked.

1 pint oysters 

54 teaspoon white pepper 

3 cups bread crumbs 

Yz cup butter or shortening, melted 
54 teaspoon salt 
1 egg

GENERAL RECIPES 45 



BOILED EGGS 

Drop eggs into boiling water and let boil 

2 to 35^ minutes for soft boiled 
3j4 to 4% minutes for medium soft 
10 to 12 minutes for hard boiled 

The variation in time of cooking depends much on the size of the eggs. 
For example, small eggs will be medium soft in 2^^ minutes, while large eggs 
will require 3^^ minutes to reach the same point of cooking. 

FRIED EGGS 

Method 1. Put 2 teaspoons of butter in a frying pan. Let butter melt 
over slow fire. Break 2 eggs carefully into the pan, taking care not to break 
the yolks. Season with salt and pepper. Let cook slowly until the whites 
of the eggs are set. 

Method 2. Put 1 tablespoon of butter or butter substitute in a frying pan. 
Melt over slow fire. Break 2 eggs as in Method 1. As soon as the butter 
starts to run out under the eggs, take a spoon and baste the eggs until 
cooked. 

Method 3. (turnover). Use Method 1 until the whites of the eggs start 
to set. With a pancake turner turn the eggs on the other side and finish 
cooking. By this method the eggs are cooked on both sides. 

OMELET— PLAIN 

Three eggs are usually required to make an omelet for one person. 

Beat 3 eggs with a fork with J/2 teaspoon salt and }i teaspoon pepper. 
Beat until the eggs can pass through the fork without sticking to it. Melt 
2 teaspoons of fat or butter or butter substitute in a hot frying pan. Pour in 
the eggs. Stir with a fork, at the same time shaking the pan, until the eggs 
start to set, carefully lifting the edges of the omelet to allow the uncooked 
portion to run underneath to be cooked. When the eggs are set, fold over 
and serve. 

Additional food material can be added to the eggs before beating, or placed 
in the center of the omelet before folding. In the latter case, the food ma- 
terial should be heated first. 

POACHED EGGS 

Boil water in a stew pan. Break an egg in a saucer and drop carefully 
into the boiling water. Cook slowly until the egg is set. Remove from water 
with a skimmer. 



46 GENERAL RECIPES 



SCRAMBLED EGGS 

1st Method. Break eggs (3) into a bowl, and season with salt and pepper 
to taste. Beat with a fork until the eggs do not stick to the fork. Put 2 teas- 
poons of butter to melt in a small stew pan. Pour in the eggs. Cook over a 
slow fire, stirring all the time until the eggs thicken. 

2nd Method. Put 2 teaspoons of butter to melt in a frying pan. Drop in 
the frying pan 3 eggs. Cook over a slow fire, and as the eggs thicken stir 
until cooked. Season to taste. 

In scrambling eggs with other food material, this food material should 
always be mixed and beaten with the eggs before cooking. 

SHIRRED EGGS 

Butter thickly a shirred egg dish, or baking dish. Put the dish on a slow- 
fire to melt the butter. Break 2 eggs in the dish and season with salt and 
pepper. Keep the dish on the slow fire or put it in the oven and let cook long 
enough to set the whites of the eggs. Serve in the same dish.

Salads 



Salads are of great value in the diet, as they supply the body with water, 
mineral salts, acids and bulk. 

Salads also are very good appetizers. 

Salads are usually made of vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish, meat, poultry or 
a combination of any or all of these materials, with the addition of a dressing. 

Salad dressings are helpful to the body as they generally contain a fat 
and an acid. 

Attractiveness in preparing a salad is of first importance. 

The attractiveness of a salad is increased by the use of garnishes. 

All salads must be served cold. 

Many good combinations in salad making can be obtained by utilizing 
leftovers in their preparation. 

Intentionally the more common salads are omitted in this book. They 
are well known, and easy of preparation. The salads given here are unusual 
and are given to enable you to have a variety of salads for your menus. 



PRACTICAL HINTS 

Green salads should not have the dressing added until just before serving. 

Mayonnaise should not be added to salad until just before serving, as it 
may liquefy. 

Fresh salad materials should be cleaned, wiped dry, and put in a salad 
bag in a cool place. Salad bags may be bought for a few cents in any de- 
partment store and will always be found useful. 

The leaves of vegetables grow bitter as they grow older.

Sandwiches 



Sandwiches are easily made and are nutritious. 

Sandwiches may be used for a quick lunch in the home, or for picnics. 

They may be made of many different food materials and may be cut in a 
variety of shapes to please the eye. 

Attractiveness in serving increases the appetite. 

Sandwiches can be of great value in utilizing leftovers. 

When using only one slice of bread or breadstuff, in a way to show the 
food material, the sandwich takes the name of canape. 

Sandwiches are made as follows : 

1. Two thin slices of bread (white, brown, graham, nut, raisin, etc.), or 
Two crackers, or 

Rolls, biscuits, or muffins cut in halves. 

2. The slices of bread or breadstuff are buttered with creamed butter or 
a mixture o£ butter and some food material or ingredient. 

3. Thin slices, purees, or chopped food material (used alone or in com- 
bination) are placed between the slices of bread or pieces of breadstuff. 

HOW TO MAKE SANDWICHES 

1. Cream the mutter and add a little salt and pepper, or 

When a mixture of butter and other food material or ing^redient is 
used, cream the butter first and add the other material, mixing 
thoroughly. A good proportion for butter mixture is 60 per cent butter 
and 40 per cent food material. 

2. Slice or cut the bread or breadstuff. Keep the slices of bread or bread- 
stuff in the order of their slicing so that they may fit together after 
filling. And remember that bread used for sandwiches cuts better 
when a day old. Spread the butter or butter mixture on the slices. 

3. Place the food material (such as slices of ham, fowl, cheese, sardines, 
roast beef, smoked salmon, chopped lettuce, chopped nuts, etc.) on 
one buttered slice. 

4. Cover with the other slice and press lightly. 

5. Trim the sandwiches by cutting crust or removing pieces of food 
material showing on the outside. 

6. Cut or shape as desired (square, round, oblong, triangular).

HOW TO KEEP SANDWICHES MOIST

best ways of keeping sandwiches moist are : exclusion of air ; added moisture ; 
keeping in a cool place.

or 
Wrap them in paraffin paper.

follows: "5 to 15 Minute Recipes"; "15 to 30 Minute Recipes"; "30 to 45 
Minute Recipes"; "45 Minute to 1 Hour Recipes"; "Over 1 Hour Recipes." 
The "5 to 15 Minute Recipes" section and the "15 to 30 Minute Recipes" sec-

"45 Minute to 1 Hour Recipes" section and the "Over 1 Hour Recipes" section 
are divided into Soups, Meats and Entrees, Vegetables, and Desserts. No Egg 
recipes or Fish recipes are included in these sections, as egg dishes can be

In a few recipes extra time is allowed for cooling before serving. For

time for the preparation of the ingredients and their cooking is only 5 to 10 
minutes. 

Most dishes, however, are served hot and the time for their preparation and 
cooking is the basis for the section in which their recipes have been placed.

other necessary preparation. The recipes under the "5 to 15 Minute Recipes" 
section take from 5 to 15 minutes for preparation and cooking, and so on. 

All of these Timed Recipes are for 4 persons, with the exception of omelets,

Leftovers 

The recipes in this section are intended to help the housewife to prepare 
new dishes from foods which have been left from a previous meal. Of course 
it is impossible for the author of this book to know exactly how much any 
housewife would have left over. These recipes, therefore, do not call for 
exact amounts of ingredients. In most of the recipes the proportions are left 
to the taste of the individual, as the amount of each ingredient used is totally 
unimportant. In some cases, where proportions are necessary for successful 
dishes they are given in terms of other ingredients in the same recipe. For 
example, in making Potato, Tomato and Onion Soup the directions are to use 
3 times^as much water as potato. The recipe does not depend on there hav- 
ing been exactly one cup of potatoes left from a previous meal. It makes no 
difference how much was left. All that is necessary is to use the correct 
amount of water in proportion to the actual amount of leftover potatoes. 

These leftover recipes will also be found useful as suggestions. Many 
similar recipes may be made by changing the ingredients used. 

Practical Hints 

Never subject leftover for a long time to high heat; but remember that 
slow cooking is sometimes necessary to soften fibers or to blend flavors. 

When possible let a hot sauce do most of the heating for meat. 

Generally leftovers need more seasoning than freshly cooked food. 

Eternal vigilance is the price of health in using leftovers. 

Food, if left over, should be put on clean platters and set away for your 
inspection next day.

Bread 

Bread is an article of food made of the grain, meal or flour of grain, mixed 
with water (or other liquid), salt, sugar, fat, sometimes eggs, and leavening 
agents, such as fermented dough, yeast, or baking powder. 

Leavening agents are used to produce fermentation and rising. The bread 
dough is mixed with the leavening agent, allowed to rise, kneaded, molded, 
and baked as loaves, rolls, biscuits, etc. Bread can also be made from other 
materials containing a certain amount of starch. 

Bread is one of the simplest of cooked foods. The necessary ingredients 
for making bread can be counted on tho fingers of one hand — flour, water, 
salt and yeast — and yet the books which describe the process of bread 
making are often large volumes. 



BREAD INGREDIENTS 
Flour. 

Bread can be made from many kinds of flour, but the best flour is the 
flour of wheat grain, because it contains a large amount of gluten. Gluten 
is the substance in the flour which, mixed or c-ombined with water, yields 
a sticky, elastic material which makes possible the formation of the dough. 
The substance left on the tongue or teeth after chewing a wheat grain is 
gluten. It is essential in bread making because gluten forms the frame which 
enables the loaf to keep its shape and retain its lightness. 

There are two diflFerent kinds of commercially sold wheat flour: 

Winter Flour is a starchy, soft flour. 

Spring Flour is a hard flour and contains a larger percentage of gluten. 

Wheat flour, including pastry flour, sold in groceries is usually made 
from a mixture of wheats. There is great difiference of opinion as to the 
best flour to use in making bread. A hard or spring flour gives ordinarily 
the best results. 

Yeast. 

Yeast is a microscopic plant which cannot be seen with the naked eye. 
It consists of masses of tiny colorless oval shaped plants. Remember that 
yeast is a plant which grows in darkness or in light as soon as given proper 
food, moisture and temperature. Under the most favorable conditions it 
rapidly increases by budding. The amount of yeast to be used in bread 
making is determined by the time given for the process. 

There are many varieties of yeast on the market, but the mxost commonly 
used in bread making are Dry Yeast Cake and Compressed Yeast Cake. 
Liquid yeast is not recommended for household use, because it grows too 
rapidly, it produces acid, and it does not keep. 

The form of yeast in bread making is not important, but the condition 
of yeast is of great importance. 

Liquid. 

Moisture is necessary in bread making. The kind of moisture or liquid 
used is not as important as the amount, and the way in which the bread is 



BREAD 359 

baked and cooled. The liquid used in the bread dough may be water, milk, 
half water and half milk, whey, potato water, or barley water. But water 
alone makes a bread of good flavor and texture, and generally white. 

Sugar. 

Sugar is a good food for the growth of yeast. Sugar is not absolutely 
necessary in bread making, but it improves the flavor. 

Fat. 

Butter, butter substitute, or lard, or any two mixed half and half, may be 
used in making bread. But fat is not a necessary ingredient. However, it 
does make the crumb a little more tender. 

Baking Powder. 

Baking powders are used in bread making to make "quick" bread. All 
baking powders are chemical preparations which, when brought in contact 
with moisture liberate carbon dioxide gas. Baking powder, in producing 
this gas, lets the gas expand and escape. In doing so, it causes the dough to 
become light and porous, the water being driven off in the form of steam. 
The amount of carbon dioxide is always influenced by the age of the baking 
powder. Even when baking powder is kept covered, there is a loss of gas. 

All baking powders are made of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), an 
acid salt, and a certain amount of starch. Remember that cream of tartar, 
alum and acid phosphate are all acid salts. 

The kind of baking powder used in bread making is immaterial to the 
results obtained. 

Salt. 

Salt is added to bread dough to improve the flavor. Common table salt 
is generally used in bread making. 

METHODS OF MAKING BREAD 

There are three well known methods of making bread: 

1. Straight dough process, or short process. 

In this process all the ingredients are mixed together at one time and the 
dough is allowed to rise. In this process yeast is always used. 

2. Sponge dough process, or long process. 

In this process only half of the amount of flour is used at first with 
practically all the liquid and the leavening agent (yeast, or cereal or vege- 
table water). This dough is allowed to rise very slowly and for a long 
time (6 to 10 hours). With the remainder of the flour and liquid another 
dough is made and mixed with the raised dough. The mixture is then 
handled as in the straight dough or short process. Baking, powder cannot 
be used in either the straight dough or sponge dough process. Yeast or its 
substitute only can be used. 

3. Baking powder process, or quick process. 

In this process all ingredients are mixed together at one time, baking 
powder included, and the dough is baked without kneading or raising. This 
is possible because of the quick leavening action of the baking powder. 



360 BREAD 

The short and long processes of making bread produce bread which is 
known as Yeast, Leavened, or Raised Bread. 

The quick or baking powder process of making bread produces bread which 
is known as Quick, Baking Powder, or Unleavened Bread. 

MAKING THE BREAD 

The dough, before it is turned into edible bread, passes through eight 
different steps known as : 

1. Mixing. 

2. Kneading. 

3. Rising. 

4. Kneading. 

5. Molding. 

6. Rising. 

7. Baking. 

8. Cooling. 

1. Mixing. 

Flour must be sifted. Dissolve the yeast with lukewarm water. Put sifted 
flour in a bowl or on a pastry board. Dissolve salt, sugar (if used) and 
fat (if used) with lukewarm water, and add gently to the flour. Put the 
mixture in a bowl and add the dissolved yeast. Mix as thoroughly as possible, 
adding more water little by little until a soft dough is obtained. If dough 
is too soft to be handled, add tnore flour; if too hard, add more liquid. 

2. Kneading. 

Beat and knead (see Kneading, below) the mixture for about 10 minutes 
until smooth and shining, or until the dough does not stick any more to the 
bowl, finger, knife, palette or pastry board. 

3. Rising. 

Take the dough and place it in a floured or greased bowl, cover with a 
floured cloth, and let stand in a warm place (80 to 88 degrees F.) at uniform 
temperature and away from drafts. Let rise until about double its original 
bulk and full of bubbles, or until a slight touch of the finger leaves an im- 
pression. This should happen, if all materials are in good condition and the 
temperature is right, in about 1 to IJ/^ hours. Then the dough is ready 
for kneading. 

4. Kneading. 

Kneading is required to mix all materials together and to distribute the 
yeast thoroughly throughout the dough, and also to equalize the distribution 
of the gas bubbles so that the big bubbles will be broken up and the bread 
will have a fine texture. The best results in kneading are obtained by using 
the hands only. 

Remove dough from bowl or pastry board and dredge pastry board with 
flour. Flour lightly hands and dough. Fold the farther edge of the dough 
toward the front without pressing the fingers into it. With the ball of the 
hand lightly pressed into the dough, roll it slightly avray from jom. Make 



BREAD 361 

your strokes in kneading light and even, and after each stroke turn the 
dough a quarter of the way around the board with a second stroke. Repeat 
this, adding a little flour at a time, or water, if necessary. No amount of 
time for kneading can be given, as this depends on the quality of the in- 
gredients, the temperature and moisture of the atmosphere. The dough, 
when kneaded enough, will keep its shape on the board, and is spongy, elastic 
and smooth. It will also have a velvety surface. Good kneading before 
rising always gives good results. 

5. Molding or Shaping. 

Take the dough and divide it into equal parts, according to the sizes 
of bread desired. Grease pans or molds. The pans or molds should be only 
half filled with the dough. Mold quickly. Each portion of dough should 
have an even surface and should be smooth. Pat the dough well into the 
corners of the molds. 

6. Rising. 

Cover with a thick cloth and place Avhere the dough will be warm (80 to 
88 degrees F.) as for first rising, until the size of the dough doubles in 
bulk. The dough will then begin to follow the shape of the pan. The time 
required for this second rising is between 40 and 55 minutes. The bread 
is then ready to be baked. 

7. Baking, 
Bread is baked : 

1. To kill ferment. 

2. To make the starch soluble. 

3. To drive off alcohol fermentation and carbon dioxide. 

4. To form a brown crust of good flavor. 

When the bread dough is ready to be baked, it should be put in a fairly 
hot oven at first (400 to 425 degrees F.) to allow it to form a crust and then 
stop rising. Then, after the first 15 to 20 minutes, let the temperature of 
the oven decrease to 380 degrees F. until the bread is cooked. The bread 
should start to brown at the end of the first 20 minutes. 

Always test the oven before baking the bread (see Oven Temperatures 
and ^^''ays of Testing Ovens, pp. 24 and 17). 

Always place the pans or molds in the oven in such a way that they do 
not touch each other, in order that the air may circulate around them and 
the temperature be evenly distributed. 

An ordinary bread loaf requires from 50 to 60 minutes for baking. Small 
loaves require a hotter oven than large ones, as the heat penetrates the 
small loaves more readily and cooks them quickly. 

Bread is done when: 

It shrinks from the mold or pan. 

It makes a singing sound perceptible if the ear is placed 
very close to the loaf. 

The undercrust and the edges of the uppercrust reboimd 
if pressed back by the finger. 



362 BREAD 

Bread should be of a golden brown on all sides when removed from 
the pans. 

^ The use of a straw as a probe for bread baking, or a knife stuck into the 
middle of the bread, is not recommended. 

8. Cooling. 

After the bread loaves are removed from the pans, put them uncovered 
in such a place and position that the air can circulate freely around them. 
Let cool off entirely before storing or eating. 

Care of Bread After Baking. 

If a soft crust is desired, brush crust slightly with melted butter while 
the bread is still warm. 

Milk applied to the crust while crust is still hot gives a smooth and 
shining appearance. 

Bread should never be wrapped Avhile hot. There is a large amount of 
steam in the loaf of bread which must escape. If anything interferes with 
the escape of the steam, the bread will sour very easily. 

When the bread is cold, place it in a tin box or jar. 

Never wrap bread in a cloth. The cloth will absorb moisture and give 
an unpleasant taste to the bread. 

Washing the bread container prevents the bread from becoming mouldy. 

Any bread container must have a few holes to admit air for free circulation. 

Never allow bread crumbs to accumulate in the bread container. 

PRACTICAL HINTS 

Hov7 To Tell Good Flour. 

If pressed in the hands, the flour should fall loosely apart and not stay in 
lumps. If it stays in lumps, it has too much moisture in it. 

It should be granular to the touch, and the color should be creamy white; 
when put between the teeth it should "crunch" a little. 

When rubbed between the fingers, the individual particles should be dis- 
tinguished, making it feel gritty or granular. It should not feel too smooth 
and powdery. 

It should have a sweet nutty flavor characteristic of the wheat grain and 
without suspicion of acidity. 

Good flour should not contain more than 11 per cent water. Flours differ 
much in their capacity for absorbing moisture, but the higher the percentage of 
gluten in the flour, the more moisture it will absorb. ' 

BREAD HINTS 

Making yeast bread from wheat flour substitute sometimes causes trouble. 
The substitute flour lacks the gluten which makes the dough firm and elastic 
and the bread light and porous. 

When wheat flour is scarce or expensive, wheat flour substitute may be 
used to the amount of 20 to 50 per cent. 

Two loaves of bread made from the same flour can be of a different color, 
taste and texture. 



BREAD 363 

Good home made bread has a flavor and quality peculiar to itself. No 
baker has ever attained it. 

To make good bread it is necessary to have good materials. 

There is no single best way to make good bread. 

Soft, pure water is best suited for bread making purposes. Hard water 
generally neutralizes to a certain extent the fermentation produced by the 
yeast. 

Water makes a bread of good flavor and texture and white in color. 

Milk makes a bread of good keeping quality, with a tenderer crumb, greater 
elasticity, and of a creamy color. 

Buttermilk, Sour Milk, Whey, make a bread similar to bread made with 
milk, except that the bread has the characteristic flavor of the liquid used. 

Potato or Barley Water give the same results as bread made with milk, 
with a slight diflference in the texture (heavier). 

.Yeast should be fresh, live, growing and in clean condition. 

Yeast must have a clean and acid odor. 

Too much yeast gives an increase of volume in the bread and a more 
crumbly loaf with an inferior flavor. 

If the quantity of yeast used is increased, the time required for rising 
is decreased; and as the quantity of yeast is decreased, the time required for 
rising is increased. 

If too much time is consumed in the rising, the bread is apt to sour. 

Too much baking powder will make a bread of insipid flavor. 

Good results are obtained in bread making by using one tablespoon of 
sugar to each one pound loaf of bread. 

Too much sugar in bread gives a toughness to both crumb and crust. 

Cane sugar gives the most satisfactory results in bread making. 

Good results are obtained in bread making by using twice as much 
sugar as salt. 

Too much salt 3vill increase the weight of the bread, make the loaf 
smaller, and the crust lose its golden brown color and become a dull grey. 

Too much salt, even in slight quantities, interferes with the proper 
aeration of the dough. 

Too much shortening in bread will make a heavy loaf. 

Lightness of bread is determined by the size of the loaf in relation to 
its weight. 

Elasticity in bread depends to a great extent upon thoroughness of 
baking. 

Coarse grained bread is caused by over rising, insufficient kneading, or 
too much heat in the first period of baking. 

Sour bread is the result of the overgrowth of the bacteria which cause 
fermentation. 

Soggy bread rnay be due to a low grade of flour, dead or inactive yeast, 
old or moist baking powder, insufficient kneading, or improper raising or 
baking. 

Streaky bread results when the dough is not properly kneaded, or when 
too much flour is used in handling or in shaping the dough and loaves.

Pastry 



Cakes or Pastries are enjoyed practically all over the world by everybody. 
They are used, as a rule, as an agreeable conclusion to a meal. 

Cakes or Pastries are very nutritious because of the ingredients used in 
their preparation (butter, sugar, eggs, flour, milk, fruits). 

In pastry making a great deal of knowledge is acquired by practice, but 
usually a recipe is needed for complete success. Pastry recipes differ from 
each other in quantities and weights of ingredients. Do not be puzzled or 
surprised by these variations, but follow the recipe and the result will prove 
to you that the recipe is right. 

Pies are easily made and are heartily enjoyed by those who eat them. 
They require less time and less care than any other variety of pastry. 

Cakes require more care in the mixing of ingredients and in baking 
than pies. 

Any filling can be used with any good cake. The filling is a garnish of 
the cake and its selection is entirely a question of taste. 

There is not much diflPerence, except in the method of preparation, be- 
tween frosting and icing. An explanation on this subject seems unnecessary, 
as it makes very little difference whether you cover the cake with icing or 
frosting. 

Any icing or frosting can be used on any cake, but habit seems to show 
that as a rule the icing or frosting must be in harmony (color, flavor) with 
the cake filling. 

The only strict rule to be applied and followed in pastry or cake making 
is to adhere strictly to the recipe. 

PRACTICAL HINTS 

The art of cake or pastry making does not consist in the possession of a 
great number of recipes. It depends more on the use and manipulation of 
eggs and leavening agent, and on application of heat than on anything else. 
Some people grasp these fundamentals quickly, some others have to think 
for a long time about them before recognizing their importance. 

Lard makes a more tender crust than butter, but the flavor of butter 
cannot be equalled. 

The flakiness of the pastry depends on the kind and amount of shortening. 

In dividing paste for pies, allow more for the upper than for the lower 
crust. 

Never grease a pie tin or plate. 

In pastry or pie making, when you put two pieces of paste or crust to- 
gether, always brush the under part with cold water and then press the two 
lightly together. 

Fruit pies have the annoying habit of leaking juice. For this reason do 
not forget in covering pie to moisten the edge or rim of the undercrust before 
pressing the upper one closely to it. 

The baking of a cake is more important than the mixing. 

The general tendency of ovens is to accumulate too much heat in the 
upper part. It is therefore helpful to place a shallow pan on top o£ the upper 
rack over the cake. 



388 PASTRY 

Bake cakes or pastries on grate as near as possible to the center of the 
oven. 

All cakes must rise to their full extent before browning on top, or before 
applying the heat necessary to cook the flour. 

Cake Failures 

To prevent failures in making cakes, try to observe strictly these sug- 
gestions : 

1. Measure or weigh out all ingredients to be used before starting to 
mix the cake. 

2. Sift flour before measuring. 

3. Add baking powder or soda to the measured sifted flour. Sift together 
before adding any liquid. 

4. Break the eggs to be used in a bowl. 

5. Beat the whites of egg (i£ necessary) just before mixing with other 
ingredients. Beaten whites do not stay stiff long if left alone. 

6. Test oven temperature just before mixing the cake. 

7. Open and shut the oven door carefully when looking at the cake dur- 
ing baking. Do not slam door, as it disturbs the cake in raising or 
baking. 

Causes of Cake Failures 

When a cake "falls in the middle," it is occasioned by : 
insufficient quantity of flour or raising ingredients, 

or 
moving it in the oven after the cake has risen and starts to bake, 

or 
removing it from the oven before it is thoroughly baked. 

Heavy cakes are sometimes caused by: ' 

too slow an oven, 

or 
the use of too much sugar or butter. 

A cake is "solid" or "bready" when too much flour has been used. 

The uneven surface and cracks on top of a cake occur when : 
too much flour has been used, 

or 
too strong heat is applied at first before the mixture has risen to its 
full height. 

Coarse grained cakes occur from : 
too much leavening ingredient, 

or 
too slow an oven, 

or 
insufficient mixing and beating of sugar, butter or eggs. 

If nuts or fruits sink to the bottom of the cake, it shows that the batter 
is too thin.

Contrarv to a common belief in America, French pancakes do not need 
the addition of baking powder. The habit of rolling jam or other sweet 
mixture, or adding flavoring (as lemon, nutmeg, or cinnamon) in the pan- 
cakes is also wrong. These are called in France jelly, spiced, flavored or 
fancy pancakes and are of English origin.

Candy 



Candy, being composed for the most part of sugar, nuts and chocolate, is 
high in food value. Sugar is also a highly concentrated food. Its pleasant 
flavor makes it one of our popular daily foods. 

Man craves "something sweet," and generally will eat all he can afford 
to buy. 

Candies are easily digested if eaten after meals. 

Sugar, on account of the rapidity with which it is assimilated, quickly 
relieves fatigue. 

Candy making is a pleasure enthusiastically welcomed by young and old. 

Home made candy cannot match the factory made candy for looks, but 
home made candy is a true, pure candy. 

All that is necessary to make candy besides the materials is a fire, a pan 
and a thermometer. , 

A knowledge of the definite temperature in candy making is essential to 
satisfactory results, as sugar in cooking gives varied results at various tem- 
peratures. Watching the changes in the syrup mass of sugar as the cooking 
progresses is a fascinating as well as a most profitable study. (See table on 
p. 420 for sugar cooking.) 

In candy making, bear in mind that the various degrees of heat produce 
differing results in the syrup, and that the real trick in candy making is to 
remove the heat at the exact moment when the desired result is secured. 

Never cook sugar with too much water. Use just enough water to dissolve 
the sugar well. About 3^ cup cold water to 2 cups of sugar is the right 
proportion. 

In candy making, always boil your sugar on a hot fire and do not let it 
simmer. 

Stir your sugar, when making candy, all you want to before boiling, but 
after the sugar starts boiling never stir unless you add milk, cream, butter 
or molasses. In this case stir gently, as the stirring is only to prevent sticking. 

PRACTICAL HINTS 

Do not try to make candy on a muggy day ; the results will be unsatisfac- 
tory. Often it is impossible to make any candy at all. 

If the day is slightly rainy or foggy, do not try to use chocolate. 
White cane sugar is better in candy making than brown sugar. 

How to Boil Sugar 

Put water and sugar in a sauce pan. 

When the sugar is melted, bring quickly to boiling point and skim. Re- 
move only the discolorations, not the froth. 

Add a pinch of cream of tartar to prevent the sugar from "graining." 

When the syrup is boiling at its own level, put in the candy thermometer 
and continue to boil until the degree required is reached. 

If any particles of sugar stick to the sides of the pan, wash them off with 
a damp brush or a damp cloth, or they will cause the syrup to grain. 



420 CANDY 

Testing Sugar While Boiling 
Put your pan containing the dissolved sugar and water (syrup) on a hot 
fire and wait until it boils. 

Take with a spoon a little of the syrup and drop slowly in cold water. 

Thread (215 to 217 degrees F.) 

When the sugar drops out from the spoon into threads, the degree is called 
"small" or "large thread," as the case may be. 

Pearl (220 to 222 degrees F.) 

As more water evaporates and the temperature gets higher, a sample of 
syrup dropped into cold water forms on the main mass spherical globules, 
which will gradually mix with the rest. This degree is called the "pearl." 

Blow (230 degrees F.) 

After a little more boiling, bubbles can be made in a little of the syrup on 
the spoon by blowing down the hollow part of the spoon. This degree is called 
the "blow." 

Feather (232 degrees F.) 

After a little more boiling, in following the same procedure as for the 
"blow," the little bubbles will fly. This is called the "feather" degree. 

Soft and Hard Ball (238 to 248 degrees F.) 

After boiling a short time longer, the syrup when dropped with a spoon 
into cold water will form a "soft ball" at 238 to 240 degrees F. A little later, 
following the same procedure, the syrup will form a "hard ball" at 248 de- 
grees F. 

Crack (290 to 310 degrees F.) 

Boiling longer, and precipitating the syrup in cold water by using the spoon, 
it will crack and set hard on the spoon. This is called the "crack" degree. 

Caramel C350 degrees F) 

Soon after the "crack" has been reached, if the syrup is kept on the fire, it 
will turn to a deep brown color, and the odor of caramel will escape. This 
is the degree called "caramel." 

After the "caramel" degree is reached, if the syrup is allowed to cook, 
it will burn.

pan in such a way that the particles of material do not touch each other. Pour 
over them the cold syrup carefully and gradually, with as little disturbance of 
the material as possible. When the material is all covered with the syrup, 
place over the top of the syrup a dampened cheesecloth. Allow this to stand 
undisturbed for about 9 hours. Remove cheesecloth. Pour syrup and material 
over a wire sieve. Let the syrup drain off entirely. This requires about 5 to 
6 hours. The pieces of material are then dry and are covered with a fine white 
crystal. 

Best results are obtained in crystallization by having the fruits sliced and 
by leaving on the skin or peel. This also improves the flavor.

Preserving 



Most of the processes of preserving food were known long before the 
reasons for them were understood. 

The greatest dangers in preserving foods are air and moisture. Improperly 
preserved foods develop mold, or they ferment and then decay or putrefy. 

The Preservation of foods is divided into two classes : 

1. Temporary preservation. 

2. Continued preservation. 

1. Temporary preservation is accomplished by protecting the food from: 
loss of moisture; too much moisture; contact with insects or dust; or losing 
color. Foods preserved under this class are commonly known as dried, de- 
hydrated, dessicated, stored, smoked, pickled, salted, processed, concentrated, 
wrapped, dipped, coated, injected, marinated, packed, etc. 

2. Continued preservation is accomplished by protecting the food against 
the action of mold growths and the attacks and putrefactive results of bac- 
teria. For continued preservation the utensils, containers and food itself must 
be sterilized, as in canning, jam or marmalade making, bottling. Another pro- 
cess of continued preservation is known a§ exclusion of air. 

Many processes of preserving foods, if properly conducted, can be used in 
the household. Skill is very seldom required in preserving food (except in 
drying and dehydrating), as preservation is really a mechanical and chemical 
process. 

The danger of food preserved under unsanitary processes is great. It 
generally results in death by poisoning. The form of poisoning can be rapid 
or slow, the speed of infection depending on the kind of food, or rather on its 
chemical and structural composition. 

Methods of Preserving 

The different methods of preserving are commonly conducted as follows : 

1. By Drying. The food materials are exposed to the natural heat of the 
sun. Of late this method has lost most of its value on account of the un- 
sanitary handling. We dry meat, fish, fruits and vegetables. 

2. By Dehydrating. The food materials are exposed to artificial heat in en- 
closed chambers. Moisture is added to the warm air from time to time 
to prevent too rapid a formation of crust on the outer part of the food 
material, due to the dryness of the air in the dehydrator. Dehydration is 
the safest way of preserving by drying. We dehydrate fish, meat, fruits 
and vegetables. 

3. By Evaporating. The food materials are subjected to dry heat or boiled 
down quickly in order to extract or concentrate the juice and flavor of 
the food. Sometimes slow heat is applied to evaporate foods to a certain 
degree necessary for their commercial value. We evaporate fruit juices, 
fruits, meat juices, vegetables and milk. 



PRESERVING 427 



4. By Freezing. The food materials which spoil quickly are frozen at a very 
low temperature. Once frozen, the food must be kept in refrigerators, 
and if shipped must be packed in ice. We freeze meat, fish, poultry, and 
some liquids extracted from fruits, vegetables or meats. 

5. By Refrigeration. The food materials to be preserved by this method 
must be used in a short time. The danger of spoilage in refrigeration is 
due to the accumulation of moisture in the refrigerator. The food ma- 
terials are placed in cold storage, refrigerators, ice boxes, or placed in or 
on ice. We use refrigeration for keeping meats, milk, eggs, butter, fish, 
vegetables, fruits, liquids and solid compounds of food. 

6. By Use of Sugar. The food materials are mixed with sugar, raw or 
cooked. Sugar has been recognized as an excellent preservative. We use 
sugar in manufacturing jam, jelly, marmalade, candy, condensed milk, etc. 

7. By Use of Oil. The food materials are immersed in cold or boiled oil or 
cooked in oil. We use oil in preserving sardines, anchovies, salmon, 
olives. 

8. By Salting. Two methods of preserving by salting are used: (1) Dry 
salting — by simply alternating in the container one thick layer of salt and 
one layer of food material. (2) Corning or salting in brine — by immersing 
the food materials in a brine made of water, salt, some condiments, 
chemical ingredients and seasoning. We dry-salt fish, vegetables, and 
meats. We corn and salt in brine meats, vegetables (corned meats: 
beef and pork). 

9. By Pickling. The food materials are immersed in a brine made of vinegar 
and salt, seasoning and condiments. The vinegar may be cold or boiled. 
We pickle fruits, meats, vegetables and fish. 

10. By Smoking. The food materials are first salted, then hung for a certain 
length of time in a closed room where the smoke of burning wood 
(generally hickory) is allowed to enter. The outside of any smoked food 
is ordinarily brown. We smoke fish, meats and poultry. 

11. By Use of Antiseptics. The food materials are rubbed or sprinkled with. 
or immersed in, antiseptic powders or preparations. Borax, alum, salicylic 
acid, are commonly used. This way of preserving is the least wholesome 
and should be entirely abandoned. We use antiseptics in preserving 
vegetables, meats and sauces. 

12. By Exclusion of Air. The food materials are preserved by processes other 
than canning which exclude the air or prevent the contact of air with the 
food. We exclude the air when we process eggs, or immerse eggs in lime 
water; also if we preserve fruits, such as grapes or apples, by covering 
them in barrels with sawdust or bran. 

13. By Canning. The food materials are put raw or cooked in sterilized tins, 
cans or jars. The containers are again sterilized when their contents are 
closed or sealed in hermetically. This is the most commonly used way 
of preserving food.

1. Drying 

(Drying by natural heat of the sun.) 

In preserving by drying with sun heat, two dangers are present: (a) Dust, 
(b) Insects. It is practically impossible to avoid them. This method of pre- 
serving by the housewife, therefore, should not be encouraged. Nevertheless, 
here are a few recommendations in using the drying process of preservation: 

The food material should be small, or cut in such a way that only the flat 
portions are exposed to the sun rays. The food material should be placed on 
trays or racks, or should hang exposed to the sun rays. When the food 
material is placed on trays, it should be turned on the tray at least once a day 
to present both sides to the sun rays. In case of rain, the food material should 
be removed to shelter. After sundown, it should also be removed to closed 
shelter. 



DEHYDRATING 429 



2* Dehydrating 

(Drying by artificial heat.) 

Dehydrating is a method of preserving food material by removing the 
moisture present in the food material which causes the food to spoil. Pre- 
servation is also brought about by the prevention of the growth of micro- 
organisms which cannot live without moisture. 

Dehydrating is also commonly known as "Drying," but the term "Dehydra- 
tion" is applied to convey the distinction that the removal of moisture must be 
made by the use of artificial heat. 

Dehydrating must be conducted carefully, as the aim of the process is to 
preserve the food materials in such a way that they retain as closely as possible 
their natural flavor, color and nutritive value. After the dehydrating process, 
the nutritive value of the food, so far as has been determined, remains practi- 
cally unaltered, there being a concentration of the food material through the 
removal of moisture. 

Dehydration stops the natural process of ripening and decaying in the case 
of fruits and vegetables. ' 

Dehydrating can be conducted without difficulty in any home kitchen, the 
equipment necessary being simple. Nor is it an expensive process. 

Equipment 
The equipment necessary for successful dehydrating in the home is : 

(a) Knives. 

They are used for peeling, paring and slicing. Ordinary kitchen knives will 
answer the purpose as long as they are sharp. 

(b) Kettles. 

The kettles are needed to boil the water required for blanching. In some 
cases the food material should be immersed for a certain length of time in boil- 
ing water and boiled for a few minutes. This blanching process may be omit- 
ted, as its purpose is only to bring out the natural color. Ordinary kettles of 
a good size are required. 

(c) Dehydrators. 

Oven. A very slow oven may be used for dehydrating purposes. The 
food materials are spread on platters, sheets of metal, or, far better, on pieces of 
wire mesh. The oven door should be left slightly open to allow a circulation of 
air which carries off the moisture so extracted from the food materials. 

Cook stove dehydrator. The best results in dehydrating are obtained by 
using cook stove dehydrators. Many small sized cook stove dehydrators are 
on the market and they give good and successful results. The cook stove de- 
hydrators are of oven-like structure, usually made of sheets of galvanized iron 
or of wood and galvanized iron. They can be placed on top of any kerosene, 
gas, oil, wood or coal burning stove, or on sides or top of furnace, or on or near 
other heating appliances. 

Hot air register. When a hot air furnace is in operation in the house, a de- 
hydrator may be placed over the register. 

In using any method or apparatus in dehydrating, remember that to be suc- 
cessful the most important point is the control of the heat to prevent scorching 
the surface of the food material. 



430 PRESERVING 

(d) Trays. 

The dehydrators available on the market hold a series of galvanized wire 
mesh trays on which the food materials are placed after being prepared for de- 
hydrating. 

(e) Containers. 

Dehydrated food materials should be stored in moisture-proof containers, 
A good container is a tin box or bucket with cover, or a can with tight cover. 
All containers should be lined with parchment paper on top of the dehvdrated 
food material to prevent direct contact with the cover. Pasteboard boxes with 
tight covers which can be sealed with adhesive tape make good containers pro- 
viding they are lined with parchment paper. Heavy paper or linen sacks 
with the end twisted and tied over double are good containers. Glass jars with 
tight covers are usually successful as containers. Unless the containers are 
moisture proof, in dry temperature the food material will continue to dry and 
harden and then lose flavor; in damp or moist temperatures the food material 
will take up moisture and spoil. 

How to Dehydrate 

(a) Preparation. 

The food material used for dehydrating should be fresh, tender and per- 
fectly clean. No food material to be successfully dehydrated should be large. 

In the case of vegetables, wash and clean well. In the case of fruit, remove 
dust. Very few fruits, except berries, can be dehydrated whole ; they must 
be either cut in halves or sliced (with or without the skins). It is also pref- 
erable, in the case of vegetable roots (carrots, turnips, potatoes, beets), to slice 
or dice before dehydrating. 

There are also a number of special practices, such as sulphurizing, lye peel- 
ing and lye dipping, which are employed commercially, but they should be 
omitted in home dehydrating. 

(b) Blanching. 

This is a practice used to remove excess acid or strong odors and to prevent 
discoloration in vegetables. Blanching is accomplished by placing the product 
in a wire basket or colander and scalding in boiling water for a short time (3 to 
5 minutes). This is followed by rapid cooling by dipping in cold water. The 
process of blanching is not essential and may be omitted without fear of in- 
ferior dehydrated product. It is a process used only to please the eye in the 
finished product. 

(c) Placing on trays. 

The prepared food materials (cut, sliced, peeled, pitted, diced or whole) are 
spread on the wire mesh trays, evenly and not in too thick layers. The thinner 
the layer, the better the result. Place the trays in the dehydrator. The heat 
must be applied to the dehydrator for at least 5 minutes before inserting the 
trays. 

Temperature of Dehydration 

The temperature required in dehydration varies with each product. The 
dehydrating can be done in two ways : 

1. Starting at a high temperature which is gradually lowered, or 

2. Starting at a low temperature which is slowly increased. 



DEHYDRATING 431 



In either case great care must always be exercised when products are nearly 
dehydrated not to let them scorch. The best test for temperature is the use of 
a thermometer. The temperature in a dehydrator rises quickly. 

Generally speaking, fruits stand a higher heat than vegetables. In veg- 
etables the risk of scorching is greater than in fruits. 

Vegetables should be dehydrated at a temperature from 120 degrees F. to 
140 degrees F. Fruits should be dehydrated at a temperature from 140 de- 
grees F. to 160 degrees F. 

Time of Dehydration 

The time required for dehydration varies according to the food material 
used and according to its moisture content. It is quite impossible, therefore, 
to give any set time for dehydrating (3 to 6 hours are generally required). 
The only safe rule is to judge each tray separately. Remove food materials 
from trays when dehydration seems sufficient. As a rule it takes a much longer 
time to dehydrate fruits than vegetables. 

When Dehydrated 

It is extremely difficult to give detailed directions for determining accu- 
rately when the food materials are dehydrated, but these few suggestions may 
assist: 

Slices of vegetables will rattle on the trays, will snap on being bent, and 
will not appear leathery. 

Vegetable dice will be spongy, but should not show moisture on squeezing. 

Peas, beans and corn must rattle when stirred on the trays. 

Fruits should reach a stage where on squeezing a handful and opening the 
hand, the pieces will spring apart. They should be elastic, springy, not brittle, 
and not so moist that water can be pressed out from the end of a freshly cut 
piece. (This applies to fruits such as pears, prunes, peaches, apricots, apples.) 
Berries should have a tendency to rattle on the trays. 

Conditioning 

After removing the dehydrated products from the trays and before storing 
or packing, the product must be put in large boxes, protected from dust and 
insects, where it can be stirred every day for a week until the individual pieces 
become uniform in dryness. This conditioning also allows part of the ordinary 
atmospheric moisture to be distributed thoroughly and evenly in the dehyd- 
rated product. 

Storing 

When conditioning is completed, the dehydrated product should be placed 
in suitable containers (see Containers p. 430). The best storing place for de- 
hydrated products is a dark and dry room. The room should be dry naturally 
and not heated. From time to time the dehydrated product should be ex- 
amined for the appearances of. insects or molds. 

Insect Control 

The worst enemies of dehydrated food materials (besides moisture) are 
insects, especially the Indian Meal Moth. The Indian Meal Moth is the great- 
est source of spoilage in dehydrating. Unfortunately there is no absolutely 



432 PRESERVING 



sure way of keeping this insect under control. If there are any signs of in- 
fection at any time, and if infection is not too far advanced, dipping the 
dehydrated food material in boiling water for a few seconds and re-dehydrating 
it for a short period will kill all insect eggs and will not injure the food 
material. 

Yields in Dehydrating 

Any statements of yields of dehydrating (i. e., the number of pounds of 
dehydrated material yielded from a given number of pounds of fresh material) 
are approximate, as a great number of factors may influence the yield, such 
as age, degree of maturity, amount and distribution of moisture, and other 
environmental factors.

How to Use Dehydrated Product 

As a general rule the best way to use the dehydrated vegetables or fruits is 
to soak them in cold v/ater for several hours and then use them in practically 
the same way as though fresh. 

Vegetables Which Can Be Dehydrated 

As stated before, there are no exact recipes for dehydrating fruits or veg- 
etables. The lists given below are not complete. Any other fruits or 
vegetables related to those named can be treated in the same manner. 

Asparagus. Wash, trim and cut in desired lengths. Then dehydrate. 

Beans (string, wax). Wash and string carefully. If too large, cut in uniform 
sized pieces. Blanche if desired. Then dehydrate. 

Beans (white, red, lima). Shell. Then dehydrate. 

Beets. Should be blanched whole with leaf tops. Do not trim tops or roots 
— this will keep the red color throughout the beets. Then peel and slice. 
Then dehydrate. 



DEHYDRATING 433 



Brussels Sprouts. Discard any spoiled outer leaves. Wash. Firm heads 
can be dehydrated whole, but large heads must be cut in halves. Blanche if 
desired. Then dehydrate. 

Cabbages (green or red). Trim, wash, core and shred. Then dehydrate. 

Carrots. Wash, scrape or pare ; slice round, long or across ; or dice. Then 
dehydrate. 

Cauliflower. Wash, trim and cut in pieces, using only the best parts. 
Then dehydrate. 

Celery. Wash, clean, divide stalks, cut in pieces. Then dehydrate.

Herbs, Plant Leaves and Flowers Which Can Be Dehydrated 

Herbs, many plant leaves, and even flowers may be dehydrated. Wash 
lightly and dehydrate slowly. Many dehydrated flowers or leaves can be pre- 
pared and served as tea. Dehydrated herbs are mostly used for seasoning and 
flavoring. 

Basil Mint Sage

3. Evaporating 

Evaporating applies to liquids, such as milk, fruit juices, meat juices or 
extracts. In the case of fruit or fish or meat, the process of evaporating is 
known as Dehydrating or Drying. 

To preserve food materials in good condition by evaporating, an evapor- 
ating apparatus is necessary. Unfortunately no small evaporating apparatus 
has been manufactured for household use. Evaporating, therefore, is not 
recommended for preserving purposes in the home, 

4* Freezing 

Preserving food material by the freezing process requires machinery and 
equipment which cannot be used in the household. This method, therefore, 
should be abandoned by the housewife. 

5* Refrigeration 

This method of preserving* is quite simple. Place the food material 
uncovered in any ice-box or refrigerator. The duration of safe preservation by 
refrigeration is 3 to 4 days. To have good refrigeration wash refrigerator or 
ice-box at least once a week with soapy boiling water. This will not only keep 
the refrigerator or ice-box clean, but will prevent unpleasant odors which are 
very quickly absorbed by the foods. 

6. Use of Sugar 

The use of sugar is the method of preserving most commonly used in the 
household. The use of sugar is necessary as a preservative in making of 
the following: 



a. 


Fruit Juice. 


b. 


Jelly. 


c. 


Preserve. 


d. 


Jam. 


e. 


Conserve. 


f. 


Marmalade. 


g- 


Fruit Butter, 



FRUIT JUICES 435 



Government Regulations on Foods Preserved by the Use of Sugar 

If offered for sale in any place, all preserved foods must be labeled in con- 
formity with the Federal and State Pure Food Laws. Copies of the Federal 
Pure Food Laws may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. Copies of the State 
Pure Food Laws may be obtained from the State Board of Health of the 
State where the food has been prepared or is to be sold. 

FRUIT JUICES 

Fruit juices are made by cooking the fruits or the juices of fruits with a 
small amount of sugar. 

Fruit juices after cooking must not be syrupy, as they are generally used 
as a drink. 

Only sound, ripe fruit should be used. 

How to Make Fruit Juices 

The only recipe which can be used safely in making fruit juices is : 
2 cups sugar 
1 gallon fruit juice 

Equipment 

The necessary equipment in making fruit juice is: 

1. Crusher of some kind. 

2. Cheese cloth. 

3. Flannel bag. 

4. Pail or bucket for holding and handling the fruit or fruit juice. 

5. Large kettle for heating the fruit or fruit juice. 

6. Wash boiler for pasteurizing bottles or jars. 

9. Caps and bottles, if using bottles to keep the fruit juice after it is 
made, or jars, jar tops, clamps and jar rings, if jars are used to 
keep the fruit juice after it is made. 

Directions 

Crush the fruit and heat to the simmering point (180 degrees F.) with the 
sugar. 

After this, strain the fruit through a cheese cloth and allow to run slowly. 

When the juice has all been strained, just warm it up a little (lukewarm), 
and allow it to run slowly through a flannel bag. 

Pour the juice in sterilized bottles, put on caps and boil slowly in wash 
boiler for about 35 minutes from the time the water has reached the boiling 
point. 

If jars are used, adjust tops and rings and raise clamps, and boil slowly in 
wash boiler for about 30 minutes from the time the water has reached the 
boiling point. Then seal. 

Fruit juice keeps better if stored in a dark place.

JELLY 

Jelly is made from the juice of fruits boiled with sugar to a clear, elastic 
consistency. 

Jelly must be of good color and firm enough to retain the shape of the 
mould. 

The flavor of the fruit juice should be clearly distinguishable in the jelly. 
In order to make good jelly, the housewife should thoroughly understand 
why the jelly jells. Pectin is the jellying principle in jellies. 

To make jelly there must be : 

1. Juice of any fruit which contains acid and pectin. 

2. Sugar. 

3. Heat. 

4. Proper equipment. 

L Pectin is a vegetable substance of starchy origin which gives the fruit 
juice its gelatinizing property. Pectin works best in the presence of an 
acid. Therefore a fruit juice which contains both pectin and acid makes a 
better jelly with a more tender consistency. When pectin is deficient in a 
fruit juice it must be added; when acid is deficient, acid must be added. 
These two points are most important in jelly making. 

There are two ways of determining the pectin content of fruit juice: 

(a) Alcohol Test. (Wood alcohol is a deadly poison and must never 
be used. Grain alcohol is therefore recommended.) Mix 1 tablespoon 
of cooked fruit juice and 1 tablespoon of alcohol. If pectin is present, it 
will either collect in a solid mass indicating a large amount of pectin, or 
in small particles indicating a small amount of pectin. Watch this test 
carefully, as alcohol dissolves the pectin very quickly. 

(b) Epsom Salts Test. Mix 1 teaspoon of cooked fruit juice, 3^ tea- 
spoon sugar and ^ teaspoon Epsom Salts. Stir until dissolved and let 
stand for 5 minutes. If the mixture jells within this time, it is a good 
jellying juice. 

Acid Test. There is no acid test readily made, except by tasting the 
fruit juice. It should have a decided acid taste to have sufficient acid for 
jelly making. 

If additional pectin is needed, boil the fruit with apple peelings, or 
with the white portion of the rind of lemon, grapefruit or orange. 

If additional acid is needed, boil the fruit with lemon juice or slices of 
lemon. 



JELLY 437 

2. Sugar. Use any kind o£ sugar in jelly making (except brown sugar), 
as long as the sugar is of good quality. 

3. Heat. Any heat produced by a cooking stove will be good in jelly mak- 
ing. Do not try to make jelly in the open air. 

4. Equipment. 

Kettles. Use flat, low kettles of medium size. 

Spoons. Use silver or wooden spoons. Do not use a galvanized iron 
spoon. 

Strainers. Fine mesh wire strainers are best. Do not use colanders or 
aluminum strainers. 

Jelly Bags. Cotton or flannel bags are best. 

Glasses and Containers. Use jelly glasses with tightly fitting covers. 

Paraffin. Any paraffin of good quality will do. 

Sterilization of Jcmi or Jelly Glasses 

To sterilize jam or jelly glasses, proceed as follows : 

Place the glasses in a pan. 

Pour boiling hot water into each until completely full. 

Let the glasses stand until the jam or jelly is to be poured in. 

When jam or jelly is ready to be poured in, empty glasses, one or two 
at a time, then fill with the hot jam or jelly preparation. 

How to Make Jelly 

Wash and pick the fruit. 

Extract the juice by boiling 1 cup of water to each pound of fruit. Boil 
until fruit is very soft — this requires about 30 to 40 minutes. Long cooking 
destroys the pectin. 

Straining. After the fruit is cooked, strain through a strainer and then 
filter through a jelly bag. Do not press, as this will make the juice cloudy. 

Adding the sugar. Place the juice back on the fire as soon as the juice is 
filtered. Add the sugar. The amount of sugar to be used is determined by the 
amount of pectin or acid in the fruit juice. When pectin is present in the 
fruit juice, 1 cup of sugar for every cup of juice is necessary. When pectin 
is lacking, only Yz cup of sugar to 1 cup of juice is necessary, even when apple 
parings or citrus rind has been added to increase the pectin content. When 
the sugar has been added, cook rapidly until the jelly stage is reached. 

Testing the jelly. Before making any test, remove the jelly from the fire. 
The use of a candy thermometer is the most efficient method of testing. The 
right degree is between 218 degrees F. and 220 degrees F. But other tests 
can be made. Two of the simplest ones are as follows : 

(a) Cooling Test. Place a tablespoon of the jelly in a small dish and cool 
quickly. If it can be pushed back with the spoon, the jelly stage has been 
reached. 



438 PRESERVING 



(b) Spoon Test. Take up a little of the jelly on a spoon. Allow it to cool 
slightly by moving the spoon gently in the air for a few seconds. Then, if 
the jelly in dropping from the spoon cleaves off in a sheet or flake and leaves 
the spoon clean, the jelly stage has been reached. 

Skimming. When the jelly stage has been reached, skim the liquid. 

Pouring jelly in glasses. Wash and boil jelly glasses to sterilize them. 
Remove from the water, a few at a time, and drain while hot. Pour the jelly 
while hot into the hot glasses. Fill the glasses full. 

Covering. Allov^ the jelly to cool off entirely, and then cover with a thin 
layer of melted paraffin. 

Sealing of Jam or Jelly Glasses 

The jam or jelly mixture must be poured in the glasses while hot. 

The glasses must be full. 

Let jam or jelly cool off entirely before sealing. 

When cold, cover the jam or jelly with a thin layer of melted paraffin — 
this excludes the air. 

If hermetic caps or tin tops are used, the melted paraffin is unnecessary, 
as the jam or jelly must be sealed while hot. 

Practical Hints 

Best results in jelly making are obtained by cooking only small quantities 
of fruit at a time — enough to make 6 to 8 glasses of jelly. 

The pectin test should be made after the juice has been extracted and 
before adding the sugar (the juice must be cooled off to the room tem- 
perature). 

The use of a thermometer prevents many failures in jelly making. 

Any fruit juice, after boiling has begun, should be cooked to the jelly 
stage as quickly as possible. 

Apple juice is the surest base for other fruit jellies. 

Fruit used for jellies should be in firm and good condition. 

Using half ripe fruit and half under-ripe fruit in jelly making gives 
satisfactory results. 

Extracting the juice from the fruit must be done by cooking in order to 
extract the pectin. 

Jelly bags must be boiled each time they are to be used. 

Do not be discouraged in testing your jelly — dift'erent juices jell at different 
temperatures. Keep on testing until jelly stage has been reached. 

Too much sugar in jelly makes the jelly soft. Too little sugar makes 
the jelly tough. 

Overcooking is bad in jelly making. 

Pectin cannot be tested out in uncooked fruit juice. 

Pectin is present in larger quantities in under-ripe than in ripe or over-ripe 
fruits. 

Jelly is more often spoiled by too much sugar than by too little sugar. 



JELLY 439 

Test your jelly three or four times during the cooking with sugar, as it 
may become overcooked in a very short time. 

No time should be lost in pouring jelly into the glasses, as jelly may 
harden in the kettle. 

If you use labels on your jelly glasses, always include the date. 

In jelly making do not use a kettle which has been chipped. Jelly will 
stick and burn on this spot. 

Rapid cooking in jelly after the sugar has been added gives a clear jelly 
of tender texture. 

Best results are obtained in jelly making when sugar has been slightly 
heated (not browned) in an oven or over a steam kettle. 

Skim your fruit juice and jelly as much and as carefully as possible. Your 
jelly will be clearer. 

Fruits Commonly Used in Making Jelly 

The following fruits jell easily as they contain pectin and acid in correct 
proportions for jelly making: 

Currants Blackberries 

Grapes Quince 

Sour Apples Plums 

Crab Apples Blueberries 

Gooseberries Black Raspberries 

Cranberries Red Raspberries 

The following fruits can jell only by the addition of acid: 

Pears Peaches 

Cherries Sweet Apples 

The following fruits can jell only by the addition of pectin: 

Pineapple Apricots 

Rhubarb Strawberries 

How to Make Pectin for Use in Jellies 

APPLE PECTIN 

1 pound apples, skin and cores only 
1 lemon, juice only 
1 quart water 

Boil together for about ^ hour. Press through a cheesecloth bag. Filter 
through flannel bag without pressure. Bottle the apple pectin. Put caps on 
bottles. Sterilize for 15 minutes. Keep in cool place until needed in jelly 
making. 



440 PRESERVING 



ORANGE PECTIN 

Scrape or cut yellow rind from peels of oranges (this is not used). Pass 
the remaining white peel through a meat chopper. Use enough oranges to 
make required amount of white peel. Mix as follows : 

1 pound white peel, ground 

1 quart water 

4 tablespoons lemon juice 

Let stand about 20 minutes. Add another quart of water. Boil about 12 
minutes. Let stand about 12 hours. Boil for 10 minutes. Pass through 
flannel bag. Bottle the orange pectin. Put caps on bottles. Sterilize for 15 
minutes. Keep in cool place until needed in jelly making. 

MINT JELLY 

Since this jelly is made and used extensively in the home, it seems advisable 
to give a recipe for making it. It is made by combining orange or apple pectin 
with crushed mint leaves. 

1 pint orange or apple pectin 
1 pound sugar 
^ cup chopped mint leaves 
54 cup water 

Bring pectin to boiling point, add sugar, water and mint and boil rapidly 
until jellying point is reached. Follow directions for making jelly (see p. 437).

PRESERVES 

Preserve is the term applied to a method of preserving with sugar whole 
fruit or pieces of fruit cut in uniform size by making first a syrup with the 
sugar and water and then cooking the fruit in the syrup until it is saturated. 

Practically any fruits, berries and sometimes vegetables can be preserved 
with this general recipe : 

1 pound fruit, washed, picked, or peeled, whole or cut 
^ cup sugar 
1 cup water 

To make good preserves is not a difficult task. 

Equipment 

The equipment necessary to make preserves consists of : 

1. Scales and Weights. 

2. Kettles. 

3. Skimmers. 

4. Sugar. 

5. Heat. 

6. Wash Boiler. 

7. Jars. 

1. Scales. Ordinary scale and weights. 

2. Kettles. Large ordinary kitchen kettles are used. Never use metal 
kettles (with exception of copper) in making preserves. 

3. Skimmers. Ordinary skimmers will answer all purposes required for the 
preserves. They are used to prevent the fruit from floating on the sur- 
face and also to remove the fruit from the syrup before placing it in 
the jars. 

4. Sugar. Any sugar of good quality can be used, except brown or maple 
sugar. 

5. Heat. Any heat produced by a cooking stove will be good in making 
preserves. Do not make preserves in the open air. 

6. Wash Boiler. An ordinary sized wash boiler for sterilization of the jars 
is required. A wooden rack placed at the bottom of the wash boiler is 
necessary in the sterilization of the jars and their contents. 

7. Jars. The most convenient jars used in making preserves are known as 
preserving jars. They are glass jars with tops, rubber rings or metal 
clamps. The preserving jars are safer than other jars, because they are 
practically air tight. 



442 PRESERVING 

How to Make Preserves 

Preparation of Fruit. 

Wash, pick, peel, cut or leave fruit whole, according to the fruit used. 
Weigh fruit, washed and prepared for preserving. 
Measure or weigh sugar. 

Cooking the Fruit. 

Boil the sugar and water in the preserving kettle until they form a thin 
syrup. Generally boiling for 2 to 3 minutes will be sufficient. 

The housewife should know of the changes which take place in the struc- 
ture of the fruit during the preserving process. When the fruit is cooked in 
syrup, a diffusion between the fruit juices and syrup takes place. If the syrup 
is thin, or of a light density, when the fruit is put into it, the diffusion or the 
mixing of the fruit juices with the syrup through the fruit cells takes place 
evenly and the fruit keeps its plumpness. If the syrup is thick or of a heavy 
density, the fruit juices are drawn out rapidly and the syrup cannot enter into 
the fruit quickly enough to prevent shrinkage. Therefore, always start pre- 
serves with a thin syrup. 

There is no set degree of density for the syrup, as each fruit used varies 
in sugar content, and when the fruit is penetrated by the syrup, the density of 
the syrup decreases or increases according to the sugar content of the fruit. 
When the syrup has reached the density desired, immerse the fruit gently in 
it. Bring slowly to a boil and let just simmer. Take the skimmer and press 
the fruit down into the syrup. If large whole fruits are to be preserved, from 
time to time turn them in the syrup to give the syrup an opportunity to 
penetrate the fruit on all sides. Whole fruits have a tendency to float and stay 
still in the syrup, leaving half of the fruit immersed in the syrup, and half of 
the fruit floating. The exposing of part of the fruit to the air is prejudicial 
to keeping an even and natural color of the fruit in the preserving syrup. 

Sterilization of Jars. 

Place jars, covers, rubber rings, or any appliances which go with the jars, 
in the wash boiler, and pour over them boiling water enough to cover them to 
3 inches above the top of the jars. Let the jars stand until the preserves are 
to be poured in. 

When Preserves Are Done. 

Preserves are done when the syrup has thickened a bit, has taken the 
natural color of the fruit used, and the fruit is tender. Syrup must be of about 
the same thickness as honey. At this time the preserves are ready to be 
poured into the jars. 

Filling the Jars. 

Remove the jars from the wash boiler one or two at a time and put on 
rubber rings, if used. With the skimmer or a spoon according to the size of 
the fruit preserved, remove the fruits from the syrup and pack them in the 
jars, the syrup being poured little by little as the packing progresses and until 
the jars are quite full. Then fill the jars to overflowing with the syrup only. 
The fruits and the syrup must be poured in the jars while hot- 
Sealing the Jars. 

Put covers on the jars and adjust the clamps. Do not wipe the syrup from 
the tops or rubber rings before sealing. Bacteria may be introduced by wiping. 



PRESERVES 443 



Place the sealed jars back in the wash boiler, cover with hot water to 6 to 8 
inches above the tops of the jars, bring to boiling point and let boil for 20 
minutes for pint size jars and 30 minutes for quart size jars. 

Care of Preserves. • 

After this second sterilization, put the jars on a tray to cool. When cool, 
invert the jars, and examine for leaks. If syrup leaks, the sealing is not safe. 
If leaks are found, remove the jar tops and examine rings for defects. Pour 
the contents of the jars in a kettle, bring quickly to boiling point, let boil for 
1 minute, and proceed as if preserves had been freshly made. Sterilize the 
empty jar tops and rings, fill jars, and seal again. Boil again for 20 to 30 
minutes to resterilize. 

Below are a few recipes for preserves. Many other preserves can be made, 
because, as said before, any fruit can be used in making preserves. 



GINGER PEAR PRESERVE 

3 pounds pears, peeled, cored, quartered 

6 cups sugar 

2 lemons, juice and grated rind

pinch of salt 

Scald the tomatoes in boiling water and remove skin. Cut them in halves. 
Press out with the hands the juice of the tomatoes. Add the sugar and salt 
and the juice and meat of the lemons to the tomato juice. Cook quickly until 
thick with sugar. Pour into sterilized jars and seal (see p. 442). The jars 
must be filled full. This preserve should be of a rich red color. 



JAM 445 



JAM 



Jam is the product obtained by cooking sugar with fruits or vegetables. 
In the process of making jam, the fruits or vegetables are somewhat crushed, 
the object being to cook the mass into a smooth paste of a jelly-like con- 
sistency. 

To make jam all that is necessary is: 

1. Fruits. 

2. Sugar, 

3. Heat. 

4. Proper equipment. 

1. Fruits. 

Use three-quarters ripe fruit and one-quarter slightly under-ripe fruit 
in making jam. This will give flavor and color to the product and improve 
the consistency. Whole fruit is used to better advantage, but cut or bruised 
fruit (not decaying) may also be used, 

2. Sugar. 

Use any sugar of good quality, except brown or maple sugar. 

3. Heat. 

Any heat produced by a cook stove can be used. Do not cook jam in the 
open air. 

4. Equipment. 

Kettles. Use any good sized kettle — porcelain lined, agate or copper 
kettles preferred. 

Spoons. Use wooden spoons or spatulas. Do not use metal spoons. 
Scales. Use ordinary kitchen scales and weights. 

Glasses, Jars and Containers. Use jelly glasses, glass jars or other con- 
tainers with tightly fitting covers. 

Paraffin. Any paraffin of good quality will do. 

Proportions for Making Jam 

There is practically only one recipe used in making jam: 
1 pound of fruit, washed and picked 
^ pound of sugar 

Fruits vary in sugar content, but, by cooking them with the sugar in 
making jam, the amount of sugar in the mass will be equaUzed. 

How to Make Jam 

Wash and pick the fruit. 

Weigh fruit and sugar according to recipe. 
Cooking the Jam. 

^ Put the fruit and sugar into kettle with a little water. Put on fire and 
bring slowly to the boiling point. Mash fruit with the wooden spoon while 
cooking. Stir frequently, being careful to lift the mixture from the bottom of 



^46 PRESERVING 

the kettle. When boiling point has been reached, increase the speed of 
cooking and cook rapidly, stirring constantly to prevent burning or scorch- 
ing. Do not stir too rapidly, or beat the mixture. During this period of 
cooking the mass reaches the consistency of a smooth, thick mass. The 
jam must be tested before putting in jars. 

Testing Jams. 

Before making any test of the jam, remove it from the fire. A candy 
thermometer is the most efficient method of testing. The temperature of 
jam, when ready to be poured in jars, will range from 221 degrees F. to 223 
degrees F. The difference between these degrees depends upon the kind of 
fruit used. If you have no candy thermometer, you may use one of the 
following tests : 

Cooling Test. Place a tablespoonful of the jam in a small dish. Let cool. 
If the mass remains in place after cooling, the jam is done. 

Spoon Test. Take up a little of the jam on a spoon. Allow it to cool 
slightly, move the spoon gently in the air for a few seconds. If the jam sticks 
to the back of the spoon, the jam is done. 

Pouring Jam in Glasses or Jars. 

Wash and boil jam glasses or jars to sterilize them. Remove from the 
water a few at a time and drain while hot. Pour the jam while hot into the 
hot glasses or jars. Fill them full. 

Covering. 

Allow the jam to cool off entirely and cover with a thin layer of paraffin. 

Jam making is the most commonly used way of preserving fruits with 
sugar. The simplicity of the process is the cause of the interest shown by 
the housewife in the extensive use of this process of preserving. Besides, 
jam is an appetizing, wholesome and very nutritious food for everybody — 
children, grown-ups and aged persons. There is no special advice to be 
given in making jam, as there is no failure to be afraid of, exception being 
made for burning which is the result of carelessness. 

List of Fruits Making Good Jam 

Jams from the following fruits are easily made: 

Apple Currant, Red 

Apple and Grape Currant, White 

Apple and Orange Currant and Apple 

Apple and Peach Currant and Raspberry 

Apple and Quince Fig

CONSERVES 

Conserves are fruits, whole or cut in pieces, cooked with sugar, and some- 
times with the addition of nuts or spices. The consistency of conserves is 
about the same as that of jam. 

When spices are added, they should not be added until the conserve has 
nearly finished cooking. 

When nuts are added, they should be chopped or cut in small pieces and 
added only when the conserve has nearly finished cooking. 

The method of making conserve is the same as that on making jam 
(see p. 445).

MARMALADE 

Marmalades are made of the pulp and juices of fruits cooked with sugar. 

Marmalades are more jelly-like than jam and pieces of the fruits are sus- 
pended in this jelly-like mass. 

Sometimes marmalades are made of vegetables, or a combination of veg- 
etables and fruits. 

Marmalades and jams are so closely related and the difference between 
them is so small that all recipes, methods of making, and also the list of 
fruits used for making jams, can be followed either in jam or marmalade 
making (see pp. 445, 446 and 447). 

FRUIT BUTTER 

Fruit butter is the product obtained by cooking fruit, or fruit pulp with 
sugar to a paste harder in consistency than jam. 

Fruit pulp can be obtained by crushing the fruit with a wooden crusher 
or by passing the fruit through a sieve. The temperature of fruit butter 
when it reaches its finished stage in cooking must range from 227 degrees F, 
to 230 degrees F. 

The recipes and methods for making fruit butter are similar to those for 
making jam. (See Jam, p. 445.) All fruits used in jam making can be used 
in making fruit butter. 

The residue of fruit in the jelly bag, after straining the fruit juice in 
jellv making, can be advantageously used in making fruit butter. (See Jelly, 
p. 437.) 

The following is a typical simple recipe : 

GRAPE AND APPLE BUTTER 

2 cups grapes 

2 cups apple, cored and quartered, but not peeled 
2 cups sugar 
- Vi cup water 

Put water, grapes and apple in a kettle and boil until tender and soft. 
Pass through a strainer or sieve, forcing the flesh of the fruits through. Add 
the sugar. Cook the mixture until thick. Turn into jelly glasses (see p. 
438). 



PRESERVING IN OIL 451 



7. Preserving in Oil 

Preserving in oil consists of immersing food materials in oil. Olive oil 
is the safest oil to use in preserving. Preserving in oil is done by two 
methods : 

(a) In cooked oil. 

(b) In uncooked oil. 

The cooked oil method gives a longer duration of preserving qualities than 
the uncooked oil method. 

The food materials to be preserved in oil (both methods) should be 
strictly fresh, sound in structure, and small in size. If the food material is 
large, it is better and safer to slice it in thin slices or cut it in strips. In both 
methods also condiments should be added, except in preserving olives, when 
they should be omitted. 

There are no general recipes or formulae to be given, but 2 quarts of oil 
will preserve safely 3 to 4 pounds of food materials. 

(a) Cooked Oil Method 
2 quarts oil 
2 onions, medium size, sliced 

1 tablespoon salt 
^ tablespoon pepper 

2 cloves 

1 small piece of garlic 

2 bay leaves 

Boil all together in a kettle for about 3 minutes. Strain through a cheese 
cloth and pour very gradually while boiling hot over the food materials, 
which should be tightly packed in a sterilized container. Adding the boiling 
oil gradually gives the food materials a chance to be penetrated by the oil. 
Put on cover when entirely cold, and store in a cool (not cold) place until 
wanted. 

(b) Uncooked Oil Method 

2 quarts oil 

1 tablespoon salt 

^ tablespoon pepper 

2 cloves 

2 bay leaves 

Note that in this method no garlic or onion is used. Arrange the food 
materials to be preserved in a container which can be made as airtight as 
possible. Sterilize both container and cover. Place the condiments between 
the layers of food materials. Pour in the oil. In pouring the oil, pour as 
slowly as possible, thus giving time to the food materials to absorb oil slowly. 
The oil must cover the food materials by at least 2 inches. Put covers or 
caps on and store in a cool place (not cold). 

Any food material such as slices of meats, fish, vegetables, fruits (whole 
or sliced), shelled nuts, etc., can be preserved in oil by using either method. 
It is useless to give a list of these different food materials, as the material 
to be preserved depends entirely on the taste and fancy of the consumer. 



452 PRESERVING 

8, Salting 

Two general methods are used in preserving by salting: 

(a) Dry salting. 

(b) Corning or salting in brine. 

Either method gives good results. Dry salting is best suited to fish, veg- 
etables, roots of vegetables, and in some cases to meat. Brine salting is best 
suited to meat. An equally good method is by using for the same food 
material first the dry salting method, and then the brine salting method. 

Sometimes, on account of warm climate or temperature, the salt brine has 
a tendency to sour. If that happens, it is easily remedied by simply removing 
the food material from the brine, boiling the brine for 2 to 3 minutes, letting 
it cool off and then pouring again over the food material. 

Food material to be preserved by the dry salt method should be as clean 
and dry as possible. In using the brine method food material should be as 
clean as possible, but does not need to be dry. 

The length of time required in both methods is given in the formulae 
below : 

(a) Dry Salting 

For 50 pounds of food material, 

5 pounds salt 
1% pounds sugar 
1 ounce saltpeter 

Rub food material with the mixture, place in containers (barrels, jars, 
boxes) and pack as follows : When packing large pieces of food material in 
barrels or boxes, alternate layers of food material and layers of mixture to 
get a perfectly even saltiness. When packing small pieces of food material 
(such as celery, small fish, etc.) in jars, place them on end with larger end 
at the bottom in the jars and sprinkle with mixture between pieces. Do not 
use tin or iron containers. Allow 3 days of salting for each pound of food 
material. 

(b) Coming or Brine Salting 

1. Salt Cure 

For 50 pounds of food material, 

7 pounds salt 
1% pounds sugar 

1 ounce saltpeter 
3 gallons water 

2. Sugar Cure 
For 50 pounds of food material, 

5 pounds salt 

2 pounds sugar 

1 ounce saltpeter 

2 gallons water 



PICKLING 453 



Allow 4 days of immersion in the brine for each pound of food material. 
In both formulae, the brine must always be kept 4 inches above the top of 
the food material. 

It is also advisable to remove food material from time to time from the 
brine. Place the food material in another container and again pour the brine 
over the food material. This will remove the salt deposit from the bottom of 
the container, and, by the repouring of the brine, will bring the salt deposit 
on top of the food material. The food, therefore, will be soaked and cured by 
a brine of equal density. 

The following vegetables are easily preserved by the Dry Salting Process : 

Brussels Sprouts Okra 

Cabbage, Green Peppers, Green 

Cabbage, Red Peppers, Red 

Carrots Radishes 

Horseradish Spinach 

Mushrooms String Beans 



9» Pickling 



The pickling of food material is done by its immersion in vinegar, with 
some condiments and seasoning. Some food materials require also a short 
period of immersion in brine to crisp them and improve their flavor (cucum- 
bers, gherkins, cherries, cauliflower, string beans). PickHng is done by using 
two methods: 

(a) Cold method. 

(b) Hot method. 

(a) Cold Method 

Wash food material, place in containers (jars, barrels), and pour over 
it the vinegar solution in this proportion : 

For 5 pounds of food material, 

2 quarts of vinegar 

2 teaspoons whole black pepper 

Yz teaspoon cloves 

1 cup brown or granulated sugar 
Yi teaspoon cinnamon 

6 bay leaves 

Yz teaspoon thyme 

2 tablespoons salt 

Cover containers. This method will pickle food material in about one 
month and a half. 



454 PRESERVING 

(b) Hot Method 

Wash food material and place in containers (jars, barrels). The vinegar 
solution is made in this proportion : 

For 5 pounds of food material, 

3 quarts vinegar 

Yz quart water 

2 teaspoons whole black pepper 

Yz teaspoon cloves 

1 cup brown or granulated sugar 
Yi teaspoon cinnamon 

6 bay leaves 

Y2 teaspoon thyme 

2 tablespoons salt 

Boil all ingredients with the vinegar, except food material, and pour over 
the food material while hot. This method Avill pickle food material in about 
one month. 

Mustard may be added in using either method. 

The making of spiced sauces and catsups are by mistake sometimes in- 
cluded in pickHng, but do not belong there. They are sauces, and are pre- 
served either by boiling or by canning. They contain ingredients other than 
salt, vinegar, sugar or spices which are the basis of the pickling process of 
preservation. 

Pickling is done by practically every housewife. A few suggestions for 
pickling follow : 

Use only good vinegar — poor grade vinegar means poor results. 

Food material should be as fresh as possible. In the case of fruits and 
vegetables, they should be unbruised. 

If vinegar is boiled too long, it loses its strength and the pickles will be soft. 

Use of too much spice in pickling should be avoided. The flavor of the 
spices should not detract from the flavor of the original food ingredients. 

Twenty-four hours of immersion in salt brine (Ij^ cups salt to 1 gallon of 
water) is plenty to crispen any food material to be pickled. 

If the food material is left too long in brine, it will shrivel. 

If the salt brine is too strong, the pickled food will soften. 

Glassware containers are best suited for storing pickles. Vinegar some- 
times acts upon the glazing of the earthenware. 

The receptacles in which the pickles stand during the making should be 
covered with a damp cloth to exclude harmful organisms. 

Never use iron or tin containers for storage of pickled food materials. 

Government Regulations of Foods Preserved by Pickling 

If offered for sale in any place, all preserved foods must be labeled in con- 
formity with the Federal and State Pure Food Laws. Copies of the Federal 
Pure Food Laws may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, 
United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. Copies of the 
State Pure Food Laws may be obtained from the State Board of Health of 
the state where the food has been prepared or is to be sold.

10. Smoking 

Food materials preserved by smoking are less likely to be attacked by in- 
sects. The most common preservation by smoking is that of meat and fish. 
For smoking fish the time required depends upon the size of the fish (usually 
about 12 hours). For smoking meat the time required for smoking depends 
upon the taste an dthe color desired (generally 36 to 40 hours of continuous 
smoking). 

The success of preserving by smoking depends upon a suitable smoke- 
house, proper fuel, and proper burning of fire. A small smokehouse is pref- 
erable to a large one. 

All meats and fish to be smoked must have been treated first with brine or 
dry salting (see p. 452), then removed and hung up to drip and dry before 
being put in the smokehouse. In the smokehouse the materials to be smoked 



EXCLUSION OF AIR 457 



should hang 7 to 8 feet above the fire. It is even better to have the fire on 
the outside of the house, and to allow the smoke to come into the smokehouse 
through an opening in the wall. 

The best fuel for smoking food materials is green hickory or corncobs. 
Avoid in any event any resinous wood — this gives a disagreeable smoky flavor. 
Corncobs catch fire and flame up very easily, so they must be watched. The 
smoking may be done by keeping the fire continuously going, but the same 
and equally good results are obtained by smoking for a few hours each day 
for one or two weeks. 

There are no special recipes for smoking. Food materials which can be 
smoked are listed as follows : 

Meats Fish 

Bear Anchovies 

Beef Codfish 

Deer Fish roe 

Ducks Haddock 

Geese Herring 

Lamb Salmon 

Pork Sardines 

Wild Boar Smelts 

Storing Smoked Meats 

When meats have been sufficiently smoked, it is best to wrap each piece 
in paper and then place them in muslin bags. Hang them in a dark, cool 
place in such a way that they do not touch each other. 

11. Use of Antiseptics 

On account of the dangers attached to this process of preservation, the use 
of antiseptics is not recommended for family purposes. Many ceuntries and 
states have by law forbidden this method of preserving. 

12. Exclusion of Air 

Preserving by the exclusion of air is most used in the preserving of spring 
and summer eggs for winter use. Eggs to be preserved, above all, must be 
fresh. Preserving eggs is recommended as a means of saving money. Pre- 
served eggs may be used when the winter market prices are high. 

There are many successful ways of preserving eggs, but for home preserv- 
ing two methods are commonly used : 

(a) By the use of lime water 

(b) By the use of waterglass. 



458 PRESERVING 

(a) Lime Water Method 

Six quarts of lime water solution in a 3 gallon container will preserve 10 
dozen eggs. 

Lime water solution is made by slacking 2 pounds of quick lime in a small 
quantity of hot water. Then mix with 2 gallons of cold water and add 1 pound 
of salt. Stir vigorously and thoroughly. Allow to settle. Pour off the clear 
solution and use for preservative. Place eggs carefully in containers, and 
pour over them enough lime water solution to cover the top of the eggs by 
2 to 3 inches. 

(b) Waterglass Method 

Mix 1 pint of waterglass (bought at any drug store) with 9 pints of boiled 
water which has been allowed to cool. Stir the mixture, pour into the con- 
tainer, and put in the eggs. Be sure that the tops of the eggs are covered 
with 3 inches of the waterglass solution. 

Wooden pails or earthenware containers are most satisfactory, as neither 
lime solution nor waterglass affects them. 

Fifty dozen eggs will be plenty for a family of five to carry them through 
the months of October, November, December and January. 

Nine quarts of water and 1 quart of waterglass in a 5 gallon container will 
preserve 15 dozen eggs. 

Rinse eggs with water after removing from preservative before using. 

Eggs in good condition will, after removal from the preservative, keep for 
about 2 weeks. 

Lime water or waterglass are good for only one preserving. The duration 
of the preserving qualities of both is about 10 months. 

Infertile eggs are better for preserving than fertile eggs. 

After the eggs are immersed in the preserving solution keep the container 
in a cool place. 

Replace with fresh water any part of the liquid which has evaporated. 

13. Canning 

Canning is the term used in preserving food by sterilization, thus killing 
bacteria and molds present in the food materials and in the containers. Can- 
ning is used to a great extent in the home for preserving food. 

The housewife should first understand thoroughly why food spoils before 
she attempts to do any canning. 

Foods spoil for two reasons : 

1. Presence of bacteria. 

2. Presence of molds. 



CANNING 459 



Neither bacteria nor mold can be seen without the use of a microscope. 
They are so small and light that they float in the air when dry. They are 
always present everywhere. When bacteria fall upon a spot of food favor- 
able for their growth, they multiply with great rapidity. One bacterium can 
produce many millions of bacteria in an hour, thus in a very short time 
causing spoilage and decay of the food material. The propagation and growth 
of bacteria, molds and spores cause the swelling or souring of canned foods 
or the molding of jams and jellies. 

Molds, bacteria and spores are killed by a process known as sterili/^ation. 
In canning, the sterilization is accomplished by heating. The food material 
to be canned is placed in jars, tin cans, bottles or other containers in which 
it is sealed hermetically. It is then heated to a temperature fatal to molds, 
bacteria and spores. No decaying or spoiling can take place until the container 
is open, as there is no means by which bacteria can enter. 

The safe temperature of heat for killing bacteria is a little over 212 de- 
grees F. (boiling point). Some bacteria are resistant to this degree of tem- 
perature, but prolonged boiling finally subdues the vitality of the bacteria. 

The principle in canning is to sterilize containers, food material, and the 
air present in the containers. 

Complete and careful sterilization, therefore, is the most important factor 
in canning. 

METHODS OF CANNING 
There are two general methods of canning used in the home : 

(a) Hot pack or open kettle method. 

(b) Cold pack method. 

(a) Hot Pack or Open Kettle Method 

By this method the food material to be canned is cooked first with brine, 
syrup or juice, then put in containers, sealed and sterilized (the containers 
being previously sterilized). This method is called also the "Old Way" and 
is not recommended in canning" of vesfetables. 



(b) Cold Pack Method 

By this method, the food material is placed in the containers uncooked 
or partially cooked (blanching), covered with hot brine or syrup and sealed. 
Then both containers and food material are sterilized at the same time (the 
containers are also previously sterilized). 

This method is considered the best in canning and is known as the "New 
Way." It is shorter and easier than the open kettle method. It requires less 
handling of the food, and the cooking is done at one time along with the 
sterilization, thus saving fuel. The food material also retains its natural 
flavor, shape and color and is not broken up as in the Hot Pack Method. 

The Cold Pack Method can be used where small as well as where large 
quantities of food are to be preserved. All the commercial canners use now- 
adays the Cold Pack Method. 



460 PRESERVING 

The Open Kettle Method is so rarely used in home canning that the 
directions for canning by the Open Kettle Method will be omitted in this 
book. More space will be given to the Cold Pack Method, which is so well 
adapted for home canning requirements. 

Steam Pressure Method 

Another method of canning has been recently used in home canning — 
the "Steam Pressure Method." The steam pressure cooker is used in this 
method. Steam pressure cookers are of different types, but most of them 
are high in price. They can be obtained from special firms carrying in their 
stock steam pressure cookers. In canning they generally give satisfactory 
results. With each pressure cooker a descriptive booklet gives a table of 
the steam pound pressure required for different food materials to be canned. 
It is useless, therefore, to explain here how the steam pressure cooker 
works, the booklet with the cooker giving a full explanation. Follow in 
this method all directions for sealing and sterilization of jars and containers. 

Government Regulations on Canned Foods 

If offered for sale in any place, all canned foods must be labeled in con- 
formity with the Federal and State Pure Food Laws. Copies of the Federal 
Pure Food Laws may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, 
United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. Copies of 
the State Pure Food Laws may be obtained from the State Board of 
Health of the state in which the food has been prepared or is to be sold. 

Terms Used in Canning 

Before going into the details of the equipment and procedure required in 
canning, an explanation of terms used in canning is necessary. 

Blanch or Blanching. The food material is put in boiling water for a 
short period of time. This softens, cleans and sterilizes the food material. 
It also removes part of the acidity and unpleasantness of flavor in the material, 
crispens it, and preserves its shape and color. 

Cold Dip. After blanching, plunge the food material quickly into cold 
water, and let the cold water run over it until the food material is completely 
cold. 

Sterilize Jars, Containers or Rubber Rings. Place jars or containers in 
a wash boiler with a wooden rack at the bottom to keep jars or containers from 
touching the bottom of the boiler. Rubber rings are only scalded. 

Hot Water Bath. When the containers or jars are packed and filled with 
the food material and the liquid (brine or syrup), they are partially sealed 
and placed in boiling water in the wash boiler (with wooden tray bottom). 
When the water starts to boil, the cover is put on top of the wash boiler and 
the food is boiled for the length of time required by it to be canned. 



CANNING 461 



Equipment 

An adequate equipment is necessary for good results in canning. 
The equipment needed is : 



1. 


Kettles. 


2. 


Colanders. 


3. 


Spoons. 


4. 


Soup Ladles. 


5. 


Wash Boiler with Cover. 


6. 


Wooden Rack or False Bottom 


7. 


Heat. 


8. 


Sugar. 


9. 


Salt. 


10. 


Water. 


11. 


Containers. 



1. Kettles. Any kettle of large size can be used. Kettles are required for 
blanching and for cold dipping. 

2. Colanders. Any colanders of fairly good size will do. 

3. Spoons. Spoons of good size are used in canning to put the salt in the 
jars (for vegetables or meat products). 

4. Soup Ladles. They are used for filling the jars with the boiling syrup 
or the boiling water. Medium sizes are preferred. 

5. Wash Boiler. An ordinary wash boiler with cover answers all the 
requirements of canning. 

6. Wooden Rack or False Bottom. This wooden rack or false bottom 
must be the same size as the interior of the wash boiler. Its purpose 
is to keep the jars or containers from touching the bottom of the wash 
boiler, thus allowing the even circulation of boiling water underneath 
the jars or containers. 

7. Heat. Heat of any cooking stove is all that is required in canning. 

8. Sugar. Any sugar of good quality can be used in canning, except brown 
or maple sugar. 

9. Salt. The use of ordinary table salt gives good results. 

10. Water. Have plenty of boiling water on hand. 

11. Containers or Jars. Any containers of any shape can be used, provided 
they can be hermetically sealed. Preserving jars with rubber rings and 
clamps are recommended. Tin cans may be used, but they require 
special squipment for their sealing (soldering), and are not well adapted 
for use by the housewife. Containers or jars of 1 quart capacity give 
better results than 1 pint jars. Jars with a wide mouth are the ideal 
containers, because they are easy to clean and the natural size or shape 
of the food material can be retained. 



462 PRESERVING 

The color of the jar has no effect on retaining the color of the food, 
but fruits give a better appearance in white glass jars and vegetables in 
greenish colored glass jars. 

When newr jars are used they should be placed in a v^ash boiler filled 
with cold water, brought to the boiling point, and boiled for 5 to 10 min- 
utes. This operation is called "tempering the jars." 

Before using new or old jars in canning, they should be tested for 
leakage. This is done by filling the jars partially with cold water, ad- 
justing the rubbers and the tops and sealing tight. Then the jars must 
be inverted to detect leaks. Changing rubbers and tops will often remedy 
leakage. 

Special care and attention should be.given to the rubber rings. Always 
use new rubber rings in canning, 

A good rubber ring should be able to stand a certain amount of jerk- 
ing and return to its original shape. A good rubber ring will not crack. 

How Canning Is Done 

To have success in canning, follow carefully the different steps and direc- 
tions given. 

All food materials, with a few exceptions, are treated the same. 

The steps in the Cold Pack Method of Canning are : 

1. Have food materials all ready — prepared, cleaned, graded, sliced, blanched, 
cold dipped, etc. (see directions for canning fruits, vegetables and meats 
pp. 464, 465, 466, and 467). 

2. Clean, test and sterilize jars, containers and rubber rings, 

3. Put wooden rack or false bottom in wash boiler. 

4. Fill the wash boiler half full of boiling water, 

5. Pack the product in the jars, 

6. Add hot syrup or water and salt, 

7. Adjust rubber rings and covers on jars. 

8. Partially seal the jars. This is done by placing the rubber ring on the 
jar, putting the cover on the jar and partially sealing it by adjusting 
only the upper clamp or by slightly screwing the lid. 

9. Immediately after partially sealing, place the jars in the wash boiler and 
cover them with boiling water, if there is not enough water in the wash 
boiler. Bring water to boiling point, put cover on wash boiler, and 
Hot Water Bath jars for the length of time given in the directions. Time 
the boiling from the time when the water begins to jump. Keep water 
boiling during the entire period, 

10, Remove jars from wash boiler and seal them completely by adjusting 
the side clamps or screwing the lids down, or otherwise completing the 
seal according to the kind of jars or containers used, 

11, Invert the jars to cool and watch carefully for leaks. 

12. Cool jars as quickly as possible, avoiding drafts as they cause breakage. 

13. When cool, wash jars and label them for storing. A cool, dry place is 
best suited for the storage of canned food. 



CANNING 463 



Care of Canned Foods 

After the second sterilization, put the jars on a tray to cool. When cool, 
invert the jars, and examine for leaks. If any leakage, the sealing is not safe. 
If leaks are found, remove the jar tops and examine rings for defects. Pour 
the contents of the jars in a kettle, bring quickly to boiling point, let boil for 
1 minute and proceed as if canning had just been finished. Sterilize the 
empty jar tops and rings, fill jars, and seal again. Boil again for 20 to 30 
minutes to resterilize. 

Botulism Poisoning 

The organism called Bacillus Botulinus is a toxin or poison which is found 
occasionally in canned foods. 

The poison that Bacillus Botulinus produces after its growth for several 
weeks or months in a sealed jar is not entirely destroyed in the preserving 
or canning process. 

The form of poisoning by the Bacillus Botulinus is known as botulism 
poisoning. 

The Bacillus Botulinus seems to be able to resist under certain condi- 
tions the action of heat at boiling temperature. Lemon juice added to the 
food in the process of canning seems, as far as experiments are concerned, to 
be a protective agent against Bacillus Botulinus. But this is not absolute. 

To avoid danger of botulism poisoning, discard any canned goods that 
are the least suspicious looking, or boil rapidly the contents of jars or cans 
for 5 minutes. 

Practical Hints 

To be successful in canning, follow closely the directions. If the direc- 
tions say boiling water, use boiling water. 

Do not begin canning in a room immediately after sweeping or dusting. 
Two hours should elapse before starting the canning. 

Flies carry germs. They must be kept away from the food which is being 
prepared for canning. 

A breeze should not be allowed to blow through the kitchen when canning 
is going on. 

Even new rubbers are not necessarily good ones. 

An alarm clock can be set in such a way that it will tell you when the jars 
should be removed from the hot water bath. 

Light, heat and freezing will spoil the most carefully canned foods. 

In canning at an altitude more than 1,000 feet above sea level, the time 
for the hot water bath should be increased 10 per cent for each 500 feet above 
1,000 feet. 

The card board box in which the jars are delivered to you can be used 
conveniently for storage. 

Before using canned food for the table, examine carefully every jar. Do 
not taste to see if it is spoiled. If there is an odor somewhat resembling 
cheese, if there is a mushy appearance of the solid parts of the food, or if the 
top of the jar is blown, DISCARD the jar and its contents. Do not use or 
eat it ; there is great danger of poisoning.

DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING VEGETABLES 

Cold Pack Method 

(1 quart containers) 

Choose young, sound, fresh, ripe vegetables. 

Wash, peel, string, cut in pieces, slices or dice. In other words, prepare 
them as for cooking. 

Blanch vegetables (if necessary). 

Cold dip vegetables (if blanching is omitted, cold dipping is unnecessary). 

Pack vegetables in sterilized jars. 

Add 2 teaspoons salt for each 1 quart jar. Do this by sprinkling the salt on 
top of vegetables. 

Fill the jars with boiling water to ^ inch of the top. 

Place rubbers on jars, adjust cover and seal partially. 

Hot water bath the jars. 

Remove jars from hot water bath.

PRACTICAL HINTS— VEGETABLES 

Do not pack corn, peas or shelled beans in the jars too tightly. 

The number of jars available can be greatly increased by reducing tomatoes 
to a pulp before canning. Tomatoes have a large percentage of water and re- 
quire many jars when put up whole. Fill the jars with the tomato pulp. 
Do not fill with water, but add the salt according to directions and give hot 
water bath for same period of time. 

Many housewives think that tomatoes can be preserved more easily in cans 
than in glass jars. This is a mistake. 

Four quarts of water should be used for blanching each quart of veg- 
etables. 

Too long a blanching of vegetables produces cloudiness and disintegra- 
tion in the jars. 

After a jar of canned vegetables has been opened, and before using its 
contents for the table, boil the vegetables for 3 to 5 minutes. This boiling 
eliminates the danger of botulism poisoning (see p. 463). 

DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING FRUITS 

Cold Pack Method 

(1 quart containers) 

It is as a rule necessary in canning fruits to add sugar. This is done by 
using syrup. Different fruits require different amounts of sugar, or syrup 
of a different density. To make the syrup, boil the water and the sugar to- 
gether for 2 to 3 minutes. The following proportion is required for making 
canning syrup : 

Thin syrup — Medium syrup^ Thick syrup — 

1 cup sugar 1 cup sugar 1 cup sugar 

lYi cups water 2 cups water 1 cup water 

A medium syrup is the best syrup for canning. 
A thick syrup has a tendency to shrink the fruit. 
A thin syrup destroys the color. 

Select firm, well grown, fresh, but not over-ripe fruits. 
Wash, peel, pare, core, pick and clean the fruits, removing all decayed 
or bruised parts. 

Grade and sort fruits into the same sizes, so that the contents of each 
jar will be uniform. 

Blanche fruits (if necessary). 

Cold dip fruits (when blanching is omitted, cold dipping is unnecessary). 

Pack the fruits in sterilized jars. 

Fill the jars with syrup or hot water. 

Place rubbers on jars, adjust rubbers and partially seal. 

Hot water bath the jars. 

Remove jars from hot water bath. 

Seal jars hermetically. 

Cool off, label and store.

PRACTICAL HINTS— FRUITS 

Do not leave fruits in hot water bath too long, as they will soften and 
lose their shape. 

Blanching of small fruits in canning prevents them from floating at the 
top of the jar. 

When canning fruits, and filling the jars with the syrup, the syrup must 
be boiling. 

The small Bartlett pears are the best for canning. 

The "fuzz" of quinces may be removed by wiping the quinces with 
a damp cloth. 

Remember that cherries and strawberries have a high percentage of acids. 
They need less heat than other fruits in canning. 
Cherries can be canned with or without their pits. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING MEAT AND FISH 

Cold Pack Method 

(1 quart jars or containers) 

It is sometimes desirable for convenience to preserve meat or fish in jars, 
but the housewife must realize the dangers which may accompany this 
method. Poisonings by canned meat are numerous. 



CANNING 467 



Use only meat and fish in perfect condition. 

Meat and fish can be parboiled or seared in fat. Seasonings and flavorings 
such as chopped onions, celery or bay leaves may be added. 

When the meat or fish is packed, the jars can be filled with a hot sauce 
and given the hot water bath with the meat. 

Canning of meat and fish in the home is not recommended on account 
of its dangers. If it is necessary to can meat or fish the following directions 
may be used : 

Have the meat in perfect condition. 

Remove large bones and excess of fat. 

Cut into convenient sized pieces. 

Sear, parboil, roast or stew, and add seasoning. 

Pack in sterilized jars. Fill jars if desired with boiling sauces, meat broth 
or boiling water and salt (2 teaspoons to 1 quart of canned meat or fish). 

Place rubbers on jars, adjust rubbers and partially seal. 

Hot water bath the jars. 

Remove jars from hot water bath. 

Seal jars hermetically. 

Cool off, label and store.

PRACTICAL HINTS— MEATS 

While meats can be canned successfully, it is advisable for the beginner 
in canning to start with fruits and vegetables. 

To open and empty a jar of canned meats, invert in a pan of warm water 
and let stand for about 5 minutes. This will dissolve the fat, which is always 
present at the top of the canned meat, and will also dissolve part of the gel- 
atinous liquid. Then the contents may be easily removed from the jar. 

Boil all canned meat as soon as it comes from the jars before eating. 



Beverages 



Beverage is the term applied to any kind of drink. 

When using water in making hot beverages, the water should be boiled; 
in making cold beverages, the water should be fresh drawn. 

Some beverages used in large quantities are sometimes injurious to health 
(coffee, tea, alcoholic liquors, fermented beverages). 

Water is the only beverage which can be used at any time of the day and 
night in any quantity without producing bad effects, providing the water is 
pure and unpolluted.

Household Hints 



The followlnjr wine rulea for easy cleaning were published by the United States Department 
•f Agriculture. Tliey are so good that they are quoted here: 

1. Keep dirt ent of the house by cleaning the walks, steps, porches and sills regularly and 
often, by screening windows and doors near the ground, and by Insisting on having muddy 
shoes and •oats cleaned or left outside. 

2. Lessen the number of dust-collecting places, such as unnecessary cupboards, grooTed and 
carved woodwork, floors with cracks, rough-finished walls, elaborately carved and up- 
holstered furniture, superfluous draperies and bric-a-brac. 

8. Remove dirt frequently and systematically. This keeps the house and furnishings in better 
condition and makes the need of heavy cleaning less frequent. 

4. Clean by taking the dirt away, not by scattering It to settle again elsewhere. 

5. Do heavy cleaning a little at a time to avoid the hard work and discomfort of the old- 
fashioned spring and fall cleaning. 

6. Have a supply of good cleaning tools such as your work calls for and keep them In good 
order in a convenient place. 

7. Use water and cleaning agents sparingly because otherwise they may spoil finishes and 
weaken glue, paste or cement. 

8. Be on the lookout for troublesome insects and animals and take prompt measures to get 
rid of them if they appear. 

9. Make all the family help by leaving things where they belong and in good condition. 

CLEANING 

Carpets. Sprinkle a few handfuls of salt on the carpet and then brush It. Or sprinkle wet 
tea leaves on the carpet and brush off with the dust. The carpet will look cleaner and brighter. 

Copper or Brass. Rub with a 10 per cent solution of oxalic acid and water. Then rinse and 
use sweet oil and tripoll to prevent retamlshing. A good way to clean copper, also, is a solution 
of 40 per cent vinegar and 60 per cent salt. Rub well and rinse with cold water. 

Crocks and Jars. To remove grease, use a solution of hot water and a little sal soda (wash- 
ing soda). 

Floors. To wash, especially in removing grease, use hot water in which has been dissolved 
a small amount of sal soda (washing soda). 

Fur. Moisten some bran with water and rub the mixture well into the fur with a cloth. 
Keep on rubbing until bran is dry. Then rub in dry bran. Then brush thoroughly. 

Gas Stove. Soak the movable parts for several hours in a weak solution of lye and warm 
water. Brush them and also the fixed parts of the stove with this solution. The grease will 
be dissolved. 

Glass, Cut, or Tumblers. Wash in hot water and soap, and rinse In clear hot water. 

Ivory. To whiten, apply essence of turpentine and bleach in the sun. 

Knives, Steel. Cut a raw potato In two, dip the cut portion in brick dust, and rub the blad* 
of knife until all stains have been removed. 

Linoleum. Wash with a weak solution of warm water and sal soda (washing soda). 

Pots, Iron. Put a small amount of sal soda (washing soda) in the pot and fill with water. 
Boll until inside of pot is clean. 

Matting. Wash with a weak solution of salt and water and dry well with a cloth. 

Silver. The easiest way to clean silver Is to boil it in an aluminum pan in water to which 
has been added 1 tablespoon of baking soda to each quart of water. This method is not recom- 
mended for silver which is meant to be oxidized, as it will remove all oxidation. For oxidized 
silver, use hot water and soap and then rub with a chamois. 

Wall Paper. To remove marks where people have rested their heads or hands, mix a cream- 
like paste of pipe clay and water and lay it on the marks. Allow the paste to remain for 24 
hours. By that time it will be dry and can be brushed off. If very soiled, try bread. Remove 
the crust of a loaf of bread and soak the inside In ammonia. Knead into a ball and rub the 
paper lightly. As the bread becomes soiled, knead it to expose a clean surface. 

Windows. Wash first with a weak solution of cold water, soap and baking soda, and th«B 
with clear water. If the windows are only dusty, wipe with crumpled dry newspaper. 



476 HOUSEHOLD HINTS 



REMOVAL OF STAINS 

Whenever possible remove stains when fresh to prevent them from setting. Always use cold 
water to remove stains made by foods containing proteins, such as milk, blood, egg or meat Juice. 
Hot water will set these stains. Use hot water for fruit and similar stains, as cold water will 
set them. 

Blood and Meat Juice. Soak in cold or lukewarm water until stains turn light brown. Do 
not use hot water, as it will set the stains. Then wash in hot water, unless material is silk or 
wool, in which case use cold water or lukewarm water. For blankets apply a thick paste made 
of raw starch and cold water. Allow the paste to dry and then brush it off. Repeat until all 
signs of stain are gone. 

Chocolate and Cocoa. If stains cannot be removed with soap and hot water, sprinkle them 
with borax and soak in cold water. Then rinse thoroughly in boiling water, if material is 
washable. For silk or wool sponge with lukewarm water. 

Coffee. If stains cannot be removed by warm water and soap, pour on boiling water from a 
height of 2 to 3 feet. With silks, put between clean damp cloths and press with a hot iron. 

Egg. Use cold water. Do not use hot water or the stains will set. Then wash with warm 
water and soap. 

Fruit and Berry. If stains are fresh, pour on boiling water from a height of 2 to 3 feet. 
Repeat, if necessary, and then bleach in the sun. If this is not entirely successful, apply lemon 
juice to the stains ajid bleach in the sun. 

Grass. If the stains cannot be rem.oved by soap and warm water, apply graiu or wood alcohol. 

Grease. For washable materials, use warm water and soap. For silk or wool, use clean 
white blotting paper, a piece on each side of the stain, and iron with a warm iron. For coarse 
materials, use cornmeal or salt, brushing off as the cornmeal or salt absorbs the grease, and 
repeating. Chloroform, benzol, naphtha or gasoline may also be used for sponging off grease 
stains, especially where dirt is mixed with the grease, but these agents must be used with 
care. 

Ink. Printing ink stains may be removed by rubbing the stain thoroughly with lard, and 
then washing with soap and warm water. For writing inks, try washing with soap and water 
first. Then try cornmeal or salt or French chalk or talcum powder, brushing off as the ink is 
absorbed and repeating. If this is not successful, soak the stains in milk for 1 or 2 days, 
changing the milk as it becomes discolored. Or rub the stains with a cut lemon, squeezing on 
some of the juice and rinsing frequently. 

Iodine. Make a weak solution (1 tablespoon to 1 pint of water) of baking soda, sal soda 
(washing soda), or borax. Wash stains in the solution and then rinse in cold water. Iodine 
stains are ordinarily brown, but on starchy goods are blue. 

Iron Rust. Rub lemon juice and a little salt on the stains and bleach in the sun. Repeat 
or add more lemon juice, if necessary. 

Mildew. Moisten the stains with lemon juice, or soak overnight in sour milk, and bleach In 
the sun without rinsing. Or dissolve 1 pound of sal soda in 1 quart of cold water and add 
% pound of calcium hypochlorite. Apply with a medicine dropper, and immediately after apply 
oxalic acid solution and then rinse. The immediate use of oxalic acid is to neutralize the first 
mixture and prevent it from harming the material. Repeat, if necessary. 

Milk and Cream. Use cold water. Do not use hot water, or stains will set. After using 
cold water, wash with soap and warm water. If material is not washable, after using cold water 
sponge with chloroform, gasoline or benzol. 

Paint. Dip in acetone and squeeze out. Material does not need to be washed if acetone is 
used, and It will dry very rapidly. If acetone is not available, use turpentine or benzol. Then 
wash with warm water and soap. 

Perspiration. Use soap and warm water and bleach after washing in the sun. If this is 
not successful, try potassium permanganate. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of potassium permanganate 
crystals in 1 pint of water. Drop this with a medicine dropper on the stains and allow to 
stand for 5 minutes. Then apply lemon juice to remove brown stains which are left. Be care- 
ful in using potassium permanganate on colored materials to test it first on some unexposed 
portion of the material to be sure that it will not remove the color. 

Soot. If soot stains cannot be removed by soap and water, use cornstarch, cornmeal, French 
chalk, or salt, brushing off as stains are absorbed. Then wash or sponge the material. If this 
Is not successful, use chloroform, gasoline or benzol. 

Tar, Asphalt, or Road OII._ Apply turpentine to the stains and then wash thoroughly with 
soap and hot water. If this is not successful, use chloroform or benzol and then wash with 
soap and hot water. Or try rubbing In lard and then washing with soap and hot water. 

Tea. If washing with soap and warm water is not successful, apply lemon juice and bleach 
In the su«. Keep the stains covered with lemon juice during the bleaching. 

Varnish. Rub with wood or grain alcohol or ether. Then wash with warm water and soap. 

TREATMENT OF BURNS 

For superficial bums, apply immediately olive oil, sweet butter, lard, vaseline or soap. 
A deep-seated bum should be treated as a wound, and preferably by a doctor.
