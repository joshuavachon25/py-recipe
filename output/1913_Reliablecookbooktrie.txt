SOUP STOCK, No. 1. 

Beefs' Liver, size of teacup, j Carrots, I cup, 

Beef anrl Bones, 5 pounds, | Turnip, 1 " 
Shin Bone of Veal, 2 pounds, | Celery, ^> " 

Old Chicken, 1, I Onion, l.~ 

Butter, 2 tablespoons, | Bay Leaves, 4, 

Salt, 1 tablespoon, | Cloves, 6, 
Pepper, y 2 teaspoon. 

Have the butcher break the bones; put- them in soup kettle 
and add enough clear water to cover; stew on back part of range 
and as scum rises, skim it off; then cover and let boil slowly, just 
bubbling at one side for 8 hours; place butter in frying pan and 
let melt; add turnip, onion, carrots and celery, all sliced, put on 
the cover and let cook 15 minutes; remove cover and stir until 
a light brown ; turn into a stew kettle and add all the other sea- 
soning; cook slowly 2 hours longer; if the water cooks out too 
much, add a little more; remove and strain through a sieve; pour 
a little water over the meats to rinse off all the good there is; 
set by until morning; there should be 5 or 6 quarts; skim off all 
the fat for drippings; keep in a cool place, this is the basis of all 
meat soups. 

Take out a portion according to the number to be served. 
This makes a nice rich soup stock. If too rich, add hot water 
until the required strength is obtained. Then put in anything 
that you wish, noodles, soup balls, rice, barley, macaroni or 
vegetables. These should be previously cooked in stew pan in 
clear water. (Cooking the soup long enough to cook the vege- 
tables spoils the flavor, i Then add to the soup or serve it plain 
with croutons in each dish when served. If a plainer soup is de- 
sired and one that will keep longer, omit the vegetables but use 
the other seasoning.

SOUP STOCK. No. 2. 

A very economical stock or soup for one or two dinners can 
be made thus. When you have roast beef, after using for din- 
ner, slice off whatever is nice cold, then put the bones and scraps 
into a kettle and cover with cold water: add any other bones or 
bits of veal, mutton or chicken, and the bones from beef steak, 
veal or lamb chops, cooked or raw; let these cook slowly 4 or 5 
hours, then strain; when cold, skim off all the fat; return to 
kettle and ln-at. adding a little parsley, celery or onion and any 
of the ingredients given for soups, or use it for puree of peas or 
tomatoes. The expense is simply nothing if you have a fire for 
other purposes, and makes a delicious soup. Do not salt any 
soup until you are through skimming ir as the salt will stop 
the scum from rising. 

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

If canned asparagus is used, open can on side, turn out on 
platter and cut off tips about 2 inches long.

Breads Rolls and Sandwiches 



NOTE ON KKEAD. 



The success iii making good bread depends chiefly on good 
flour, good yeast and good care. Compressed Yeast raises quicker 
than dry yeast l>nt must be fresh. As it is delivered fresh every 
morning to the dealers, they should always supply yon with such. 
It is hest to have the quantity yon need cut from the bar as it is 
always fresher than the packages in tin foil as they are apt to 
he stale. If it is soft or sticky, or turning black, reject it. It 
should he a creamy while and rather firm. If Yeast Foam or 
other dry yeast is used, soak soft in 1 pint warm water and then 
add flour enough to form ;i soft hatter. Let stand over night 
and then proceed same as with Compressed Yeast. It can he 
used in the morning by soaking soft in warm water hut it will 
take a little longer for the bread to raise. If home-made yeast of 
any kind is used, the recipe for Potato Yeast given in this hook 
is fine. Proceed the same way. allowing 1 pint for 4 loaves of 
bread. Always remember it is not economy to use poor flour. It 
takes more to mix the bread stiff enough, requires more care 
and patience, and is more apt to go to waste in the end. I'se 
good, winter wheal flour. If a cheap flour must he used, peel 
and boil 2 or 3 potatoes, mash fine and add a little sweet milk. 
When just warm, mix the bread measuring this potato mixture 
and leave out the same quantity of water and proceed the same 
way as recipe given below. Add more flour if needed. 

The next step, do not scald your bread. Have the water to 
soak the yeast and mix the bread warm hut cool enough to hold 
your finger in it comfortably, then instead of placing near the 
stove or on warming oven or reservoir, put it over a pan of warm 
water and cover closely. II will raise faster than any other way. 
If scalded in any stage of the process it will not raise, neither 
can it he remedied after it is done. Follow the directions closely 
and you will have perfed bread. If you fail at first, try again. 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 11 



Practice will soon enable you to do it just right. In cold 
weather, warm the flour in the oven, then sift it. Always sift 
flour before using it. If you wish to bake 2 loaves of bread, or 
1 loaf and a tin of biscuit for small family, use 2 cents worth 
compressed yeast or 1 teacup home-made yeast. If dry yeast is 
u -c(l, follow directions on package and use half the quantity 
flour and other ingredients given in recipe for 4 loaves, adding 
more flour if needed to mix to required stiffness. 

POTATO YEAST. 

Peel and grate 8 large potatoes into 2 quarts of cold water, 
then add 1 cup of flour wet to a smooth paste with cold water; 
set this on the stove and cook 10 minutes until thoroughly boil- 
ing, stirring occasionally to prevent burning; while cooking add 
1 cup of white or light brown sugar, 1 cup of salt, 2 teaspoons of 
ginger; remove from the stove and when cold stir in 1 yeast cake 
soaked in a little warm water (compressed yeast will not do). 
Pour in a large jar to raise; let ferment 2 days and then put in 
fruit jars. In summer set in the refrigerator; it will keep 2 
months. Use 1 large cup for 3 loaves of bread; makes delicious 
bread or rolls. 

BREAD. 

Flour, 4 quarts, I Sugar, 1 heaping tablespoon, 

Water, 1 quart, | Sinclair's Fidelity Lard, 1 

Compressed Yeast, 4c worth, tablespoon. 

Salt, V 2 tablespoon. 

Early in the morning sift flour into your breadpan; push 
it to one side and pour the water in, having it just warm; then 
add sugar, lard, Sinclair's Fidelity, and salt, and mix this all 
through the water; then add yeast previously soaked in 1/2 ( ' U P 
warm water; mix the ingredients all together, work in a little of 
the flour to form a batter; take about 5 mlinutes to do this; then 
begin to work in the rest of the flour until you have it all in or 
until it seems stiff enough, so it is not sticky. < >f some it requires 
more and of some less flour to make a medium stiff dough. Take 
out on tin 1 board without any crumbs, kneading it 15 or 20 min- 
utes. Dredge the board with flour during the process. When 
you have it in a smooth lump so it does no1 stick to the board 



12 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

much if any, rub your bread pan out clean so not to have any 
flour or crumbs in it, grease it with Sinclair's Fidelity Lard, lay 
in the dough, cover, and place pan over another tin containing 
warm, not hot, water. Let raise until light, or twice the original 
size, about 2 hours. Then work it down either in the pau or 
taking it out on the board. Grease the pan again avd let it 
raise, then repeat once more. It will come up very quickly the 
last 2 times. Then take it out on the board, divide into 4 loaves, 
make each piece into a smooth, long or round loaf, put in greased 
pans and let raise on the table this time, unless in very cold 
weather, then set in warme rplace. Remember no more flour 
is to be used after it is mixed the first time only to dust the 
board. When loaves are 1-3 larger than when made, wet them 
over the top with the hand dipped in cold water and set in to 
I Â»akc. The oven should be cool at first, increasing the heat after 
the bread has been in about 10 minutes. Bake about 3-4 hour. If 
1 loaf is wanted to use fresh, bake it a little longer. Turn out, 
-ivase the top with butter and lay on the bread board without 
covering until cold. Bread made in this way will prove very 
sweet and nutritious. The object is to have it raise light and 
yel to arrest the fermentation the last time of raising, as it is 
finer grained and better bread and whiter than when allowed to 
gel so Light and placed in a hot oven. This formula is not as 
much trouble or as long as it seems. The bread can be baked by 
noon or before in warm weather. 

This recipe makes 4 good sized loaves.

BROWN BREAD No. 2. 

Sweet Milk 1 pint, | Molasses, y 2 cup, 

Corn Meal, j Salt, 1 level teaspoon, 

Compressed Yeast, 2c worth, j Wheat Flour. 

Scald the milk, then thicken it with enough corn meal to 
make it about like mush, then add all of the other ingredients, 
using enough flour to make a medium soft dough. 

Steam 1 hour, then bake y 2 hour; if preferred, use y 2 cup 
of Soft Yeast instead of the Compressed Yeast. 

BROWN BREAD No. 3. 

Graham Flour, 3 cups, | Molasses, 1 cup, 

Com Meal, 3 cups, | Soda, 1 heaping teaspoon, 

Sweet Milk, 2 cups, I Baking Powder, 2 heaping tea- 

Sour Milk, 2 cups, spoons, 

Salt, 1 level teaspoon. 

Dissolve the soda in the sour milk, then add all of the other 
ingredients;. steam 3y 2 or 4 hours; brown in the oven 20 or 30 
minutes. All of the Brown Breads are nice steamed in lib bak- 
ing powder cans. Grease them, fill about half full of the dough 
and set in steamer. 

COFFEE BREAD. 

For the sponge take 1 pint of milk and \y 2 pints flour and 
3 cents worth compressed yeast or its equivalent. In the evening 
warm the milk to blood heat, stir in the flour and beat until it 
is a smooth batter. Then add the yeast, previously soaked in y 2 
cup warm water. Let raise over night. In the morning sift in 
a pan 3 pints of flour, make a hole in the middle and put in the 
sponge. Add 1 cup sugar, y 2 cup soft butter, 1 level teaspoon 
salt and the yolks of 2 eggs. With the hand mix the ingredients 
all together, then work in the flour, kneading into a smooth 
lump without any crumbs. Of some binds of flour you will have 
to use a little more. If it sticks and seems too soft, add a little 
more flour. Take out on the bread board bat not until it is 
a smooth lump and knead about 10 minutes. Place in a crock or 
pan to raise. When it is twice the original size, divide in 4 parts

;iikI roll out to U/2 inch thickness. Lay in a greased pan, rub 
melted butter over the top, strew with sugar and cinnamon to 
taste, and raise. When light, or as thick again as when rolled, 
bake in a moderate oven 25 to 30 minutes. Turn out but do not 
cover until cold. Do not get the oven too hot as it burns quicker 
than bread. This quantity makes 3 cakes in dee]) pie tins and 1 
long one. It is very nice. 

If a plainer bread is desired, use less butter and sugar. 

CORN BEEAD. 

Sour Buttermilk, 1 ' â¢_> pints, Flour, 1 tea cup, 

Sugar, 2 heaping tablespoons, | Soda, 1 teaspoon, 

Eggs, 2, J Salt, Y 2 teaspoon, 

Fine Yellow Corn Meal. 

Beal sugar and eggs together, add milk, then the soda which 
iias been dissolved in a little hot water, then add the other in- 
gredients, using enough corn meal to form a rather soft batter. 
Bake about ' 2 hour in a square pan in a quick oven. This is very 
nice and will serve 8 persons. If sour milk is used, which is not 
as rich, add 2 tablespoons of Melted Butter or Drippings. If you 
prefer sweet milk, make just the same, add the Butter and 2 
heaping teaspoons of Baking Powder, instead of the Soda. If 
desired, yon can use 2 or 3 Yolks ,,f Eggs, instead of the 2 whole 
eggs. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

Wain i Wat ei-. 1 quart, ; Salt, 1 level teaspoon, 

Wheat Flour, Soda, ' -> level teaspoon, 

( Nnn pressed Yeast, lc worth, Molasses, y 2 cup, 

Graham Flour. 

Make a sponge with the warm water and enough wheat 
flour to make a rather thin hatter, add the yeast and let raise 
over night. In the morning, add the rest of the ingredients, dis- 
solving the soda in the molasses and using enough Graham Flour 
to make it as stiff as can be stirred with a spoon. Put in a 3 
(i nail greased pan, or 2 small pans and set in a warm place to 
raise; when raised to the top of the pan, hake about 1 hour in a 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 15 

moderate oven. When done, rub a little butter over the top. 
This is easily made and very nutritious. You can reserve enough 
sponge when making Wheat Bread to make a loaf of Graham. 
Sift all Graham Flour or Meal, as the very coarse husks that 
remain in the sieve are not good for the stomach. If desired, y> 
cup of Soft Yeast may be used instead of the Compressed Yeast. 

OATMEAL BEEAD. 

Oatmeal Mush, 1 pint, | Water, 1 cup, 

Wheat Flour, 4 cups, | Salt, 1 teaspoon. 

Sugar, 1 cup, | Compressed Yeast, 2c worth. 

Cook oatmeal as you would to serve for breakfast, then 
measure. Stir together all of the ingredients and let raise over 
night. In the morning, add enough flour to make it as stiff as 
can be stirred. Put in greased pans and when very light bake 
in a pretty hot oven ; bake longer than Wheat Bread. If desired, 
use the equivalent in Soft Yeast instead of Compressed Yeast. 

RYE BREAD. 

White Flour, 1 quart, | Molasses, y 4 pint, 

Rye Flour, 2y> quarts, | Salt, 1 tablespoon, a little 

Corn Meal, 2-3 pint, heaping,

First make a sponge by warming iy 2 pints of the water, 
then sift in the white flour and add the yeast (previously soaked 
in a little warm water), beat to a smooth batter and set in a pan 
of warm water to raise until light, Then put the other V/ 2

Meats and Meat 5auces 



ROAST BEEF. 



Never wash roast of beef, lamb, or mutton. Wipe off with 
damp cloth. Place beef in pan dry. Set in hot oven, turn sev- 
eral times so it will sear all over and retain juice. 

For a 2 rib roast, allow 1 hour if liked rare, for 3 ribs, IV2 
hours, and larger ones 2 hours, etc. If wanted done through, 
allow longer time. About 20 minutes before the time is up, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Do not add any water. The fat 
will brown in pan for gravy. When done, take up and set the 
pan on the stove and add 1 or 2 tablespoons flour according to 
size of roast. Stir until smooth and brown. Add hot water 
until ef the right thickness for gravy. 

When carving, cut crosswise of the grain of beef. If not 
salt enough, put a little salt in the juice that runs out in the plat- 
ter and dip it over the slices before helping the plates and you 
will say that it is delicious. 

Adding water to beef while roasting makes fit tough. 

POT ROAST OF BEEF. 

This is a nice way of cooking some of the cheaper cuts of 
beef. Wipe the meat with a cloth wet in warm water. Place it 
in a hot frying pan and sear or brown it all over. This may be 
done in the kettle if tit is large and flat bottomed. Turn it over 
and over until every part is browned. If done in the kettle, add 
about 1 cup water and place kettle where water will keep just 
below the boiling point, gradually bubbling at one side. If 
browned in the spider, put the meat in the kettle and rinse out 
the spider with a cup of water to save all the brown part and 
pour tlrs water on the meat. Add salt and watch the meat very 
carefully that the water does not boil entirely away before meat 
is tender. Let meat brown on both sides. Dish up am 1 make a 
gravy by adding a little flour and hot water.

CREAMED BEEF. 

Chip as much dried beef as required. Cook y 2 hour in clear 
water. Drain off the water and pour on milk to cover. Cream 1 
heaping teaspoon, flour and butter each for 1 pint of milk. Stir 
in the meat, If too thick, add more milk. It should be of about 
the consistency of thick cream. 

Nice served with baked potatoes. 

A LA MODE BEEF. 

Bound or Neck of Beef, 6 lbs., | Pepper, V2 teaspoon, 
Salt Pork, (Sinclair's) y 2 lb.,| Salt, 1 level tablespoon, 
Onion, 1, | Vinegar, 2 tablespoons, 

Boiling Water, 2 quarts, | Butter or Drippings, 2 table- 

Bay Leaves, 4, spoons, 

Whole Cloves, 6, j Browned Flour, 2 tablespoons. 

Lard the beef with the salt pork (Sinclair's) this is done 
by cutting the pork I Sinclair's) in strips 3 inches long, make an 
incision in the beef with a sharp knife and draw the pork (Sin- 
clair's) through; this will hold the strips in place. Place in a 
smooth bottom iron kettle the butter or drippings. When hot, 
put in the sliced onion and let it fry a minute or two, then lay 
in the meat and let brown, turning and browning on all sides, then 
add the boiling water, bay leaves, cloves, salt, pepper and vine- 
gar; cover and cook slowly 4 hours or until meat is tender; if it 
is young beef it will not take as long. After it has cooked a 
while add more hot water if needed; keep enough water on so it 
will not stew dry until nearly done, then remove cover and stew 
dry. Take up the meat, add the browned flour, or use white flour 
letting it brown in the kettle and stirring the meanwhile, then 
add hot water until it is the right thickness for gravy. Strain 
through a sieve and serve with the meat. The onion may be 
omitted if desired. 

CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE. 

First procure a piece of corned beef, a rum]) piece or roll. 
Wash in cold water, place in kettle of hot water and set where 
it will just simmer or bubble on one side; conking slowly is the 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 27 

secret of a perfect result ; if allowed to cook fast it will harden 
the fiber and will be almost impossible to cook it tender. Allow 
from 4 to 5 hours for cooking, though longer will not hurt. After 
it has cooked 1 hour, taste the broth and if very salty, pour off 
part of it and add fresh water, keeping it nearly covered with 
water. 

Trim off outer leaves of cabbage and cut in quarters letting 
the heart remain to hold it together. Place in pan of cold water, 
sprinkle salt over it and let stand; this is important as it will 
draw out any bugs or worms that are sometimes between the 
leaves. Drain off some of the broth on the beef into another ket- 
tle, add enough fresh water so it will be just right salt; wash 
the cabbage out of the salt water, place in this kettle, cover and 
cook until tender, allowing 1 hour if new cabbage and longer if 
old. 

Turnips are nice cooked with the cabbage. Pare and cut 
in halves or quarters. They will take nearly as long to cook. 

If potatoes are included, peel and put in y 2 hour before 
cabbage is done. 

Dish the vegetables all together or in separate dishes and 
put the meat on a platter. 

If any meat is left, press it down in a crock and slice cold 
or use it for hash. 

DRAWING FOWLS. 

Have your butcher draw your fowls to roast by what is 
known as the "French method," or show you how. It is done 
by pushing the skin of the neck back as far as possible, then cut- 
ting off the neck and laying it aside to be cooked with the giblets. 
The skin can then be stretched to admit the hand and work out 
the craw through this opening. Be sure to get it all out. Draw 
the body of the bird in the ordinary manner. Wash out both 
openings very clean and wipe dry, and then stuff middling full 
of dressing. Tie the end of the neck with a cord. A little prac- 
tice will soon make perfect. Fowls treated in this manner pre- 
sent a much finer appearance than when drawn in the ordinary 
manner and sewed up.

a short time. When ready to fry, take out on a cloth, dry and roll 
in flour. Have equal parts of butter and lard (Sinclair's Fidel- 
ity i or drippings in frying pan. Place the pieces close together. 
Season with salt and pepper; cover close. When brown, turn 
and brown on the other side. When both sides are brown, add 
2 or 3 tablespoons hot water and again cover. The steam makes 
it tender. When all water is cooked out, uncover. As soon as 
brown and crisp dish up. Add 1 heaping tablespoon flour to the 
spider and stir a few minutes; add milk enough to make the 
gravy of the right consistency, salt and pepper to taste; serve in 
gravy boat. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Cut up and wash a fat hen, stew until tender; add sal! to 
taste. Make a gravy by adding flour wet smooth with cold

yon would if served as slewed chicken; pour out in a dish or 
granite pan. Add pepper to taste. 

Make a crust like baking powder biscuit, only richer, allow- 
ing 3 teaspoons baking powder and a good V2 CU P l ar d (Sin- 
clair's Fidelity 1 to 1 quart flour, and 1 level teaspoon salt. Mix 
and roll out until about ' L . inch thick; cut in squares, placing 
some under the pieces of chicken, some around the edges and 
over the top; hake about ( â¢_. hour. In this way it can be served 
better than when crust is in one piece. If preferred the chicken 
may be removed from the bones.

own gravy. If not, add a piece of butter and a sprinkling of pep- 
per. Dish up and make a gravy by adding 1 tablespoon flour to 
the kettle and stirring a few minutes and then add milk grad-

FRIED CALF'S LIVER. 

Place liver on paper and wipe off with a damp cloth. Then 
by cutting a little at one side the outer skin can be peeled off, 
leaving it clean without washing. Water toughens it. Slice 
crosswise about ^ inch thick. Roll in flour and fry in equal

FRIED PIGS FEET. 

Procure Sinclair's Dressed Pigs Feet and lay them in salt 
water over night. Wash thoroughly in fresh water, then put on 
to cook in hot water and boil V2 hour, then set the kettle on the 
back of the stove where they will just simmer or cook slowly for 
several hours until very tender, just so they do not fall from the 
bones. While cooking add salt to season as other meat. Remove 
from scove, take out carefully and lay on a platter so they will 
not touch each other. When partly cool take out the large bone, 
then let cool. Beat up 1 egg and add 2 tablespoons of hot water ; 
dip in this the pigs feet (Sinclair's), then roll them in cracker 
dust. Place in frying pan equal parts of butter and lard (Sin- 
clair's Fidelity) enough to cover the bottom of the pan. When

then pour this over the pigs feet (Sinclair's), while hot. Turn a 
plate over them to keep them under the vinegar. They will be 
good the next day and will keep some time. Are very nice. If 
desired, use 1 red pepper pod, or 2 tablespons of whole black pep- 
per instead of the peppercorns.

ROAST QUAIL. 

To cook this way they are nicer dry picked. Draw them same 
as chicken but leave whole. Wash and place for 1 hour in salt 
water to draw blood out and make them white. Wash and wipe 
dry. Take ' â _. cup bread crumbs, moisten with a little milk anÂ«J 
butter, a dash of salt and pepper, and 6 oysters cut in halves. 
Mix the foregoing and stuff the quail. Place 1 whole oyster under 
each wing and tie a string around to keep them in place. Tie 
the legs together; lay in a dripping pan with a few bits of butter 
and sprinkling of flour. Add a very little water and bake ^2 
hour or until done. Baste 2 or 3 times while baking. This 
quantity of dressing is for 3 quail. Serve with jelly or spiced 
currants. 

SWEET BREADS. 

Lay in strong sail water for 1 hour, then cook in stew pan y% 
hour or until tender. Take up and strip off the outer skin, and 
cut in quite small pieces. Place in stew pan with some chicken 
broth or gravy (left over when you have chicken). Add water if 
not enough gravy, or use good meat stock or meat gravy. Season 
with salt and pepper. Serve on slices of buttered toast. 

FRIED SWEET BREADS. 

Cook and strip off the outer skin same as above and slice 
crosswise having pieces about as large as oysters. 

Beat 1 egg, add 2 tablespoons hot water and dash of salt 
and pepper. Dip pieces of sweet breads in this and then in 
cracker crumbs and fry like oysters. (See recipe).

the pint of water, add bay leaf and bring to boil. Add salt and 
pepper. Strain this mixture over gelatine and add beef extract. 
Dip a mold in cold water, pour in a little of the jelly and set 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 37 



away to cool. When cold, lav the ball of tongue into mold and 
prick the cold jelly with a fork to make the next layer adhere. 
Then pour on enough jelly to cover the tongue. Let get cold. 

Sliced chicken or turkey may be used instead of tongue, 
using alternate layers with the jelly. 

BOILED TONGUE. 

If salt, wash in cold water and boil. If fresh, soak in strong 
salt water over night. Change first water when cooking. Add 
salt while cooking. When tender take up and strip off the outer 
skin and lay on platter and garnish with egg sauce. (See recipe). 
Serve warm. Beef's tongue requires 4 or 5 hours to cook. 

If wished to serve cold, cook as above, skin while hot, lay in 
a crock, sprinkle with pepper, put on a plate and weight to press 
it. Add a little of the broth it was cooked in. Place in a cool 
place until next day. Slice thin and garnish with parsley. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

If possible get a young and fat fowl, wash with cold water 
and wipe inside and out with a cloth. Rub 1 teaspoon salt and 
i/o teaspoon pepper inside, then fill with any of the dressings 
given. (See recipes). Do not fill too full as dressing swells 
when baked. Sew up with coarse thread. Wrap white paper 
around the legs as far as the first joint and tie with cord. This 
is to keep them from getting hard and dry. Tie the legs to- 
gether and tie the wings down close to the body using a strong 
coid. Place your meat roaster or dripping pan on the stove, put 
in 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon lard (Sinclair's Fidelity) or 
drippings. When hot lay in the turkey and set in hot oven. 

Cut up the giblets, place in stew pan and cook in about 1 
quart hot water. When turkey has been in about y 2 hour, pour 
the giblets and water in the pan adding 1 tablespoon salt to a 10 
pound turkey ; cover. Baste several times while baking by 
dipping the gravy over the fowl with a large spoon. As the 
water cooks down and the fat fries from the fowl, it will brown 
in the pan so the gravy will be a nice brown. The oven should 
be kept to an even heat to cook it through and brown without 
burning. When done, take up fowl and giblets and add 2 table- 



38 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

spoons flour to the pan, set on the stove and stir until smooth, 
then add hot water until the right thickness for gravy. Some 
like the giblets chopped fine and added to the gravy. Fowls are 
very juicy and tender cooked in this way as the juice is retained 
by searing in the oven before the water and salt are put in. 

The time for baking is W 2 hours for 7 to 10 pound fowl and 
2y 2 hours for 12 to 15 pounds, and for a larger one 3 hours. 
Serve with cranberry sauce. 

For an old fowl, stuff and steam until tender, then brown 
in oven. 

In absence of a roasting pan for fowls and meats, use a 
common dripping pan and cover with another pan.

beaten eggs and 1 pint of milk. Stir this together. If it seems 
too dry, add a little water and 2 spoonfulls of gravy from the 
pan. Have it rather moist. Pour this in one end of the pan con- 
i Mining the meat and bake V 2 hour longer, basting several times. 
Time for roast, 2 hours altogether. Veal should be thoroughly 
cooked. Dish up meat and dressing. 

.Make a gravy by adding a little more flour and hot water to 
the gravy in the pan. If the water should cook out too much 
while the meat is baking, add more. 

VEAL PIE.

add salt. Take out meat, pick from bones and cut in pieces. 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 39 



Place in a baking dish or pan. Make a gravy in the broth by 
adding a little flour wet smooth with water. Should be about 
as thick as cream. Season with salt if needed, butter and pepper. 
Pour this over the meat. There should be enough gravy to come 
up over the meat.

When hot, lay in the meat, dredge with 1 teaspoon salt and V 2 
teaspoon pepper. Cover and cook slowly about 20 minutes. When 
brown, turn and fry on the other side. Have them nice and 
brown; take up on warm plate. Add to the pan y 2 cup cream 
or milk, stir until it boils a little thick and pour on the meat 
and serve. Time, V 2 hour or more. 

STUFFED BREAST OF VEAL. 

Have the butcher cut a veal breast so that it makes a pocket. 
Fill the pocket with bread or meat stuffing. Lard it. Place in 
pan on stove 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon Sinclair's 
Fidelity lard. When hot, place in the meat. Roast IV2 hours 
in oven. For gravy, add to the drippings in the pan a little flour 
and 1 cup soup stock. Strain through a seive and serve hot.

quantity required. When soft, squeeze out dry with the hand. 
Put in a dish and add salt and pepper and sweet milk enough to 
make it rather thin, about like bread pudding. To about 2 quarts 
of this add 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 quart 
oysters. This will be sufficient for a large turkey. For a 
chicken, use less quantity. Rub a little salt and pepper inside 
the fowl before putting in the dressing. Do not stuff too full as 
dressing swells. Put what remains in the pan when the fowl is 
within I/, hour of being done, or put in a separate greased pan 
and dip a little gravy and a few bits of butter over the top. Bake

hand, use meat gravy from roasts, or chicken broth, or gravy 
which should always be saved as it can be used in so many 
ways. Mushrooms are rather tasteless without something of 
this kind. Half of this quantity is sufficient for a small family.

Fish and Oysters 



BAKED FISH. 



Scale and remove head. Wash thoroughly in cold water 
and then place in cold water with some salt strewn over it for 
1-2 hour. Wash out and dry. Make a dressing with 1 pint 
bread crumbs, 1 3 cup melted butter, 1 teaspoon minced parsley 
oi 1 some minced onion, 1-2 teaspoon salt and 1-4 teaspoon pep- 
per, and the yolk of 1 egg to bind together. Rub a little salt 
and pepper inside the fish, then put in the dressing. The above 
quantity for a 4 or 5 pound fish. Fasten together with 4 or 5 
wooden toothpicks instead of sewing. 

Place dripping pan on the stove with some slices of salt 
pork (Sinclair's) and lay the fish on this. Place a few bits of 
butter over the top, 1 tablespoon salt and a little white pepper. 
Add 1 cup hot water to the pan. Place in rather hot oven and 
bake 3-4 hour. Baste 2 or 3 times. Serve as soon as done. 
Dish by placing a cake turner underneath. Loosen carefully 
from the pan, sliding out on a fish platter and serve with Egg 
Sauce (see recipe). A smaller fish can be prepared the same 
way. Pike or Pickerel are best to bake; Trout and White fish 
next. 

PLANKED FISH 

This is a delicious and easy way to cook fish. Scale and 
remove head of either Pike or Pickerel. Wash clean and lay 
on a board and split open by cutting down through the ribs 
each side of backbone so it will lay Hat, then dry with a cloth. 
Place pan on stove with 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon 
drippings or (Sinclair's Fidelity) lard, for 4 pound fish. When 
hot remove to table, place the fish in skin side down, beat 1 
egg and spread thinly over fish and then strew over it 1-2 cup 
fine brown bread crumbs (see recipe), 1 teaspoon salt, dash 
white pepper and a few bits butter. Place in very hot oven 
for 20 or 30 minutes. Slip on platter and serve at once.

spoon butter and 2 tablespoons flour. Mix with picked fish 
and your into a baking dish. Strewn grated cheese thickly 
on top and bake in a quick oven until brown. It is nicer if 
you add a raw egg to the mixture before baking. 

SALT CODFISH 

An unusual and tempting way of serving salt codfish is 
thus : Cut several thick slices of best part of codfish and soak 
in cold water for several hours. Then cook slowly in pelnty of 
water and drain. When cold cut slices in uniform 
pieces of any shape deisred. Lay them in a soup plate and

them. Serve at once with Cabbage Salad No. 1. 

A wire basket is best for this purpose. Cover the bot- 
tom of the basket with the oysters and pluuge it in the ket- 
tle of hot fat lifting out when cooked. All are at once re- 
moved. In absence of a basket use a wire ladle or fork plac- 
ing under them to remove quickly. Place on soft paper or

Fidelity ) bason is crisp. Serve on toast garnished with parsley, 
hey Â»-an he baked and served without toast. 



RAW^ OYSTER DISH 

Select a nice clean square chunk of ice. Hollow out 
the center. This can be done by chopping out some of the 
ice, then take hot stove lids, or anything hot and melt the center 
so it will form a large hole. Into this put raw oysters and place 
on a large platter or dish. Garnish the dish with ferns, vines 
or in any suitable way. Set in center of table and serve to each 
individual with sliced lemon. This keeps the oysters cold lie- 
sides forming a very pretty and attractive dish, as the oysters 
can be seen through the block of ice.

5alads and 5alad Dressings 



NOTE ON SALADS. 



Have all ingredients and dressing- ice cold. Keep in the 
refrigerator until ready to serve. Lay vegetables in ice water 
for a time to make them crisp, such as lettuce, celery, cucum- 
bers, cress, dandelion, etc. Lay tomatoes and cabbage on ice. 
Mayonnaise can be kept several days in ice box. Add whipped 
cream when used. Bottled and butter dressings will keep 6 
weeks, adding cream, if wished, when used. In this way a 
salad can be prepared in a short time. Salad oil, dish and 
fork must be very cold in warm weather before beginning to 
make mayonnaise dressing. The lighter preparations can be 
made when wanted for use. For fish salads, the fish should be 
kept on ice until ready to serve. Oysters must be cooked in 
time to get perfectly cold for oyster salad. 

LETTUCE CUPS. 

A tempting way to serve salads when head lettuce or nice 
crisp leaves are not obtainable. Take the larger leaves and fold 
pleats in the edge to bring them up in the shape of jelly cups 
using Japanese toothpicks cut in two to keep them in place. 
Keep in cold place and put salad in them when ready to serve. 

SWEDISH TIMBALS. 

Flour, y 2 pint, | Sugar, V> teaspoon, 

Milk, 1 gill, Saiad Oil or Melted Butter, 1

: lie time to form a smooth batter. Have a kettle of hot, pre- 
pared tat, ( see recipe), dip the tinibal iron in the hot fat, then 



60 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 



into your batter and then back ino the fat until it is a light 
brown. The dough that adheres to the outside of the iron forms 
your timbal or cup. Take it out and drop on a paper to absorb 
the grease. They are better the second day after being made. 
Fill with creamed oysters, chicken or meat salad. 



BEAN SALAD. 

Baked Beans, 1 can, Vinegar, 

Onions. | Hard Boiled Eggs, 

Boiled Beets. 

Chop or cut onions rather fine. Place in a dish a layer of 
beans, then a layer of onion, then a layer of beans, then a layer 
of onion alternating until dish is full having beans for the last 
layer. Moisten with vinegar but not enough to be sloppy. Cover 
the top with sliced eggs and beets. Garnish with parsley. 



CABBAGE SALAD No. 1. 

Cabbage, 1 large quart, | Bottled Salad Dressing, 2 ta- 

Grated Horse Radish, 1 table-j blespoons, 

spoon, i Vinegar, 4 tablespoons. 

Sugar, 2 heaping tablespoons. 

Shred the cabbage fine, then measure. Place all of the in- 
gredients together in a dish, stir thoroughly with a fork. No 
salt is required as there is enough in the salad dressing and it 
wants to be crisp. Have cabbage fresh. This is nice to serve 
with Fried Oysters. Garnish the dish with Lettuce or Celery 
Leaves. 

CABBAGE SALAD No. 2. 

Cabbage, 1 quart, Bottled Salad Dressing, 1 cup. 

Celery, j â _- pint, Sweet Cream, 1-2 cup.

CHICKEN SALAD. 

Chicken, 1 quart, j Salt, 1 teaspoon. 

White Crisp Celery, 1 pint. White Pepper, 14 teaspoon, 

Hard Boiled Eggs, 3, | Vinegar, 2 tabelspoons, 

Lemon, 1, j Mayonnaise Dressing. 

Cut up and cook until quite tender a 4 or 5 pound chicken. 
When nearly done add the salt. When done let stand in the 
broth until cool, then take out and pick from the bones. Remove 
the skin and gristle, then shred the chicken in rather small 
pieees. Cut the celery into Vo inch, pieces and dice the eggs. 
Place the chicken, celery and eggs in a dish and add the juice of 
the lemon, pepper and vinegar; stir all together and set in the 
refrigerator until ready to serve, then add enough Mayonnaise 
Dressing to moisten. Pour in a salad dish, placing on top some 
of the Mayonnaise. Garnish with Lettuce or Curled Celery. In- 
stead of Mayonnaise, the other Salad Dressings are very nice 
mixed with whipped or plain cream the same as in Shrimp Salad. 
< Jold Turkey can be used the same way. 



CELERY SALAD. 

Celery, | Chopped Red Bell Pepper,* 1 

Hard Boiled Eggs, 4, teaspoon a little heaping, 

Bottled Salad Dressing. 

Put the celery in ice water to get crisp. Boil eggs 20 min- 
utes then lay in cold water. Do this some time before you are 
ready to make the salad. Wash and clean celery, then take sev- 
eral stalks at a time and with a knife cut rather fine and put in 
a dish. Add the eggs cut in small pieces and the pepper. Then 
add enough salad dressing to wet it thoroughly, and mix together 
by tossing it up with a fork. Have about as much celery as eggs 
when prepared, or you can use more celery when eggs are expen- 
sive. If preferred you can use Mayonnaise Dressing instead of 
the Bottled Salad Dressing. Large stalks or pieces of celery that 
are not nice for the table, are just as good for salad if nicely 
scraped and laid in ice water for a time. Do not waste any, for 
celery that cannot be used for salad is good for soup.

and a few bits of butter; then another layer of potatoes and sea- 
soning, and so on until the dish is full. Pour in sweet milk so 
you can see it but not quite cover them. Cover the top with 
cracker crumbs and bits of butter and bake 1 hour.

When tender, drain and make cream gravy same as for new po- 
tatoes. 

FRICASSEED SWEET POTATOES. 

Pare small sweet potatoes (if large, cut in two once or 
twice i and throw in cold water or they will turn black. For 
about 2 quarts of the potatoes use 1 heaping tablespoon of brown 
sugar, 1 teaspoon a little heaping of salt and iy 2 pint's of water 
i very dry ones may require a little more water), cover close and 
cook until you can puncture them with a fork, then add 14 cup 
of butter. Be very careful not to cook until too soft. Now set 
them back on the range where they will brown slowly. If there 
should be too much water when done, do not pour it off, but re- 
move cover and let it simmer on top of the stove and they will 
soon stew dry. A good way to do is to put them on a little early, 
allowing 1 hour for the process. You cannot hurry them or they 
will burn. The under pieces can be lifted up to the sides so the 
top ones can brown too. If they stew dry before tender, add a 
little more hot water. A little practice will soon enable you to 
get them just right, then you will have a dish fit for a king. They 
are also economical in that the small potatoes that are too small 
to bake are just as dice. Any that are left over can be fried alone 
or mixed with white ones and fried.

ening into flour with chopping knife until well mixed. Add just 
enough water to hold paste together. 

PIE CRUST No. 2. 

Flour, 1^ pints. j Salt, y 2 teaspoon, 

Lard, (Sinclair's Fidelity), % | Sugar, y 2 teaspoon, 
pint, 

Sugar, i 2 teaspoon. 

Eave the lard (Sinclair's Fidelity) very cold, mix lightly 
through the flour with salt and sugar. Then pour in ice water 
enough to wet most of the flour, leaving a good y 2 cup of lard 
(Sinclair's Fidelity) and flour crumbs. Take out on the board 
what you have mixed together, handling it as little as possible, 
just enough to get it in shape to roll out. For the under crust, 
roll out huge enough to cover the edge of pie tin. Put in your 
filling. Roll out top crust and place y 2 of the crumbs left from 
your crust on this and roll again until the desired thickness. This 
makes the crust flaky and tender. Wet the edge of the first 
crust with the fingers dipped in cold water, place on the top 
crust, press down closely, and finish with a cloth as directed in 
cherry pie. This quantity of crust will make 2 medium sized 
pi's. If a richer crust is desired, use a little more lard 
Sinclair's Fidelity). If more crust is mixed than is used, place 
in a bowl, cover with a damp cloth and set in ice box. It 'will 
keep - <>r 3 days. 

APPLE PIE. 

Pare and slice thin, tart apples, enough to fill rounding full 
deej) pie tin, lined with crust ; strew on 1 small cup of sugar, add 
about 3 tablespoons water, 1 level teaspoon cinnamon and a few 
small bits â¢>(' butter; place on crust and proceed same as berry 
pie; bake in moderate oven until crust is light brown and apples 
seem done. Serve with <jood cheese.

BANANA PIE. 

Line a deep pie tin with good pie crust, (see recipe), letting 
it come up well around the edge. Bake. When cool, peel and 
slice enough bananas to fill it rounding full: sprinkle over the 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 79 



top about ] o cup powdered sugar. Cut in pieces like other pies, 
and place on each piece Whipped cream. Very nice and easily 
made. 

BANANA CREAM PIE. 

Line pie plate with crust and rim. Fill with sliced bananas. 
Beat the yolk of 1 egg with 1-3 cup sugar. Add 1 teaspoon 
orange extract and 1 cup cream or rich milk. Pour this over 
bananas and bake. Cover with a meringue made of the whites 
of 3 eggs beaten stiff with 3 tablespoon powdered sugar and 
flavor with orange extract. 



BLACKBERRY PIE. 

Proceed same as in Black Raspberry Pie, using blackberries 
intsead of raspberries. 

BLUEBERRY PIE. 

Pick over carefully and wash fresh blueberries, enough to 
fill pie tin an inch deep; strew on 1 small cup of sugar, 2 table- 
spoons vinegar and 1 A cup water ; place on top crust and proceed 
same as other berry pies. 

CHERRY PIE. 

Make a crust, i see recipe i. roll and place in rather deep pie 
tin; pit the cherries; fill the tin nearly full and strew on 1 cup 
of sugar; wet the edge with cold water; place on top crust and 
pinch down closely around the edge. Take a strip of white mus- 
lin (old will do) about V 2 inches wide, dip in cold water, 
squeeze dry, and holding it with one hand, with the other hand 
stretch it around the edge as tightly as possible, pressing it 
smooth on the crust and underneath. After the pie is baked re- 
move the cloth carefully. This is the only sure way I have ever 
found to keep the juice from stewing out in the oven, and all 
housekeepers know what a mess that makes, besides spoiling the 
pie.

late and wet smooth with hot water and add to the mixture. 
stirring until thick. Pill the shells. 

FROSTING. 

Whites of Eggs, 4, | Sugar, 2 heaping tablespoons.

these 2 heaping tablespoons of sugar and beat; then add I 1 - 
pints of rich milk. Pour in deep pie tin lined with pie crust, and 
si t-ew in 2 tablespoons of cocoanut. Bake until crust is done and

thick, then roll out crust and cut in V 2 inch strips, twist them 
and lay across the pie both ways to form diamonds or squares; 
bake quickly so the crust will be crisp.

CURRANT PIE. 

Currants make nice pie when full grown, just before turning 
ripe, or if preferred use ripe ones. Stem, wash and fill pie tin 
about an inch thick; strew on 1 cup sugar and 1-3 cup water; put 
on top crust and proceed same as berry pie. 

PLAIN CUSTARD PIE. 

To 3 eggs beaten with 2-3 cup of sugar add 1 pint rich 
sweet milk. Line deep pie tin with crust, fill with the mixture, 
grate nutmeg over the top and bake in moderate oven. 'Too long 
or too fast baking will make it watery. 

GOOSEBERRY PIE. 

Stem and wash enough berries to till pie tin lined with crust; 
strew on 1 cup sugar and about 1-3 cup water ; this with the sugar 
and juice of the berries generally makes the pie juicy enough ; 
put on top crust and proceed same as other berry pie. Full grown, 
partly ripe, wild gooseberries do not take as much sugar as tame 
ones and are finer flavored ;they are also nice canned for win- 
ter use. Bake the pie a little longer than the raspberry pie. 

TWO CRUST LEMON PIE. 

Line pie tin with crust, (see recipe. ) Put in crust first 1 cup 
sugar and then the grated yellow of 1 large lemon. Do not get 
in any of the white. Then peel off the white rind close to the 
pulp, slice very thin, place these over sugar and strew over it a 
very scant 1/ - 2 cup flour, 1 tablespoon butter cut in small pieces, 
add 1 cup cold water and place on the top crust, securing edges 
closely as directed for other pies. Bake in rather hot oven until 
light brown. It will cook together like jelly and be very nice.

filling : 

Lemons, 2, | Eggs, 3, 

Sugar, li ._, cups, Flour, 2 heaping tablespoons.

Grate the yellow rind of the Lemons (being careful not to 

gel in any of the white or ii will be bitter), and squeeze out the 
juice. Stir sugar and flour together, then add the beaten yolks 
of eggs, beal this thoroughly, then add juice and grated rind of 
i he lemons, water and butter. Place this in a double boiler and 
cook until thick, stirring often. When cool, pour in shells. Beat 
the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, then add 2 tablespoons sugar 
and spread over the top and set in oven until a delicate brown. 
This makes 1 large, thick pie or 2 small ones. 

If preferred, the filling can be put in before the crust is 
baked, then bake. I like the former best. 

LEMON CREAM PIE No. 2. 

Lemons, 1, | Eggs, 3, 

Sugar, 1 coffee cup. Flour, 1 heaping tablespoon, 

Water, 1 coffee cup, | Melted Butter, 1 tablespoon.

fresh berries; strew on 1 cup of sugar, wet the edge with cold 
water, place on top crust, press down closely and trim the edges; 
then place the cloth around as directed in cherry pie; bake in

Puddings, Pudding 5auces 
and Deserts 



NOTE OX DESERTS. 



The lighter deserts, such as ices, ice cream, sherbets, fruit 
deserts, Light puddings, fresh fruits, etc., should be served in hot 
winner, leaving the rich puddings, mince pies, etc.. for winter. 
Buy a good ice cream freezer, ii is money well spent as you can 
make so many inexpensive deserts which are delicious, superior 
nÂ» what we buy and for 1-3 the price. 

My way is to prepare whatever kind I am going to make and 
put it in the freezer. Place the cover in position, adjust the 
crank. Have a burlap or grain bag in which put the ice and 
pound with an ax until in rather small pieces. Pack in the 
freezer firs: ;; layer of ice, then coarse salt, then ice and sa on 
until filled. Pse twice as much ice as salt. Turn the handle 
until it is difficult to move. Wipe off the lid and remove. Pull 
ion the dasher, scrape it off and with a wooden paddle heat 
cream 5 minutes, pack down smooth and replace cover. Remove 
cork from mi f .' Inb and drain off the water and ad-! more sail 
and ice and then cover the tub with a piece id' carpet and set 
away nut il wanted t .Â» serve. 

Ices and -duM-'i-i s are easily made an dnot expensive. I :\i]y 
fingers, wafers, plain cake, sponge cake or cookies are sufficient 
for every day to serve with ices, sherbets or ice cream. If lor 
company any id' the richer cakes can be used.

i equa] parts, then rol] out to fit large pie tins. Place 2 layers 
m each pie tin, spreading the butter between the layers and bake 
a light brown in a hot oven, about 12 minutes. Have the berries 
stemmed, and if sandy wash carefully in cold water, then add 
sugar and mash, stirring the sugar through the berries; it is 
better to do this sunn time before wanted, then set them in the 
ice chest until wanted for use. While warm, lift off the layers 
of cake a s they will not stick with the butter between them, then 
spread the berries between the bi vers and on fop; if desired, a few

Loaf Cakes 



NOTE ON CAKES. 



Always use fine granulated sugar for cakes of all kinds 
unless otherwise directed in recipe. In cold weather have 
the butter where it will soften a little but not melt, so it will 
cream easily. White butter makes whiter cake. If butter is very 
salty, wash in a dish of cold water pressing it through with 
the hand. White cake that would otherwise be very nice is often 
spoiled by the salt in the butter. Pour off the water then meas- 
ure. Use fresh eggs, which should be kept in the refrigerator in 
slimmer. Good material will give good results. Liue tins with 
light weight manilla or common yellow paper for all kinds of 
loaf and layer cakes, except Angel Food, Sunshine and Sponge 
Cake. Grease paper slightly with lard (Sinclair's Fidelity) or 
unsalted butter. Layer cakes require a hotter oven than loaf 
cakes. In baking loaf cakes it is better to have a slow oven to 
give it time to raise, then increase the heat a little. If too hot, 
set a dish of water in the oven. If getting too brown, lay a paper 
over the top. Ovens that bake pies nicely on the bottom require 
a grate under tins for cake. If a large, round layer cake is de- 
sired, bake in 3 tins and put together as directed in Almond 
Cake. Any white or yellow cake recipe can be used and put 
together with any of the many fillings given herein, remember- 
ing to flavor cake accordingly, as, almond flavoring for almond 
cake, vanilla tor chocolate, etc If wanted to cut in square 
pieces, bake in a long or square tin, making 2 layers. Finish 
same as round ones, icing top and sides. Any sized granite or 
l in pans can be used for loaf cake by placing in the center for a 
lube a baking powder can, from which label has been washed 
and can filled with nails to keep it down, and kept for this 
purpose. 

Fruit Cake requires a vevy slow oven with grate under 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 115 

pan to keep it from burning'. Try all loaf cakes with broom 
straw; if nothing adheres to it cake is done. Let cool before 
turning out of pan. Never beat cakes after whites of eggs are 
added unless so instructed. Stir them in lightly and bake at 
once. For Angel Food, Sunshine and Sponge Cake, stir as little 
as possible after flour is added, unless otherwise instructed in 
recipe. Too much stirring makes it tough. A round cake is 
nice cut in the following manner: Turn a glass or cup upside 
down on the center of the cake, mark around it, remove the cup 
and then put your knife straight down and cut around the mark, 
and then cut your pieces from this out to the edge. You can cut 
i lie pieces a little thicker as they will not be as long and easier 
handled. 

ANGEL FOOD No. 1. 

Whites of Eggs, 11, | Cream Tarter, 1 teaspoon (a 

Sugar, V/ 2 cups, little heaping), 

Flour, 114 cups, I Flavoring. 

Use a large platter, a spoon egg-beater, large, fresh eggs, 
very fine granulated sugar and a good winter wheat flour. 

Sift sugar and flour each 6 or 8 times, the more the better, 
then measure. Have platter, beater and eggs very cold and 
everything in readiness before beginning to put together. Add 
pinch of salt to whites of eggs before beating, then beat about 
half stiff enough, add cream tartar and beat until very, very 
stiff. Stir in sugar very gently, a little at a time, then the flour 
in the same way and add the flavoring. Use Vanilla or any kind 
you wish, or it is very nice to use a little each of almond, vanilla 
and rose flavoring. Put in an ungreased pan and bake in a very 
slow oven, increasing heat a little after cake raises. Put cake to- 
gether as quickly as possible and bake immediately. You can 
use a regular Angel Food Pan, square or round, or take a com- 
mon pan and put a pound baking powder can in the center; use a 
round can with a round pan, and a square can with a square pan. 
Let the can project a little above the pan, and when cake is done, 
remove from the oven and turn upside down to cool. When cold, 
remove can and with a thin knife, loosen cake around the sides 
and on the bottom and turn out. Ice with Boiled Icing. The cup

RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 121 

seedless raisins. When filling the pans, divide the dough equally 

for the 2 cakes. Put in a layer of dough, then a layer of citron 
and figs, then a layer of dough and so on. I use common tin or 
granite pans with y 2 pound Baking Powder Can for tube, filled 
with nails to keep it down. They can be washed and kept for 
the purpose. Always line the pans, using 1 thickness of brown 
or heavy paper and about 3 of yellow paper for the bottom and 1 
thickness of yellow paper for the sides. This insures a nice 
brown ; they must not be burnt or they are spoiled. Bake 
slowly, about 1 M L Â» or 3 hours. Try with broom straw. Ovens 
that bake fast on the bottom should have a grate placed under 
the pans. Let cakes stand in pans until cold, turn out bottom 
side up and ice with the following: 1 coffee cup granulated 
sugar and } â _> cup water. Cook in a little stew pan until rather 
thick but not as long as for regular boiled icing, pour over the 
white of 2 eggs beaten to a stiff froth; beat until cold or nearly 
so, then spread on cakes. This will not look white but keeps 
them moist and will be all right to use any time. y 2 teaspoon 
almond flavoring added to the icing gives it a delicious nutty 
flavor. Yon can iee them with a regular boiled icing at any 
rime. These will keep a long time and are better after 2 or 3 
months. Keep in stone jar or closely covered cake box.

whites of 2 eggs beaten very stiff; pour this boiling sugar in a 
fine stream on the Avhites, beating with an egg beater or a large 
spoon ; beat until cold, it will begin to stiffen ; then pour on the 
cake; it will be smooth and crusty on the outside and creamy 
within; if the sugar is not cooked enough it will run off the 
cake; if cooked too much it will be sugary and hard; if it seems 
this way a few drops of hot water stirred in before spreading on 
the cake will remedy it. Add a few drops of almond flavoring to 
the icing.

Boil sufear and water together without stirring until it will 
hair or thread between the thumb and finger ; then pour in a fine 
stream over the stiffly beaten white of egg, beating while you 
pour and continue to beat until cold enough to spread on cake. 
When cold, add flavoring to suit the taste; it is nice to use sev- 
eral different kinds together. If the sugar is not cooked enough 
the icing will run off the cake ; if too much it will be hard and 
sugary ; a few drops of hot water added will remedy the latter. 
A little experience will soon make perfect. It will be very 
creamy if made just right.

Beverages 



COFFEE. 

In order to make good coffee, there are several points that 
are absolutely necessary to be observed. First, have good flavored 
coffee, the Steele- Wedels Co. Mocha and Java, is one of the fin- 
est brands, then grind it medium or rather fine. Next, have your 
coffee pot clean. Break into a cup 1 egg, beat it, then add cold 
water to fill the cup 2-3 full; pour 1-3 of this over 4 heaping 
tablespoons of the ground coffee, stir thoroughly, then put it in 
the coffee pot. Pour over the coffee 2y 2 pints of boiling water 
and set it back where it will steep, not boil, for 30 minutes, then 
set it in front where it will boil up. After it boils about 5 min- 
utes take off and add a spoonful of cold water to settle it, let 
stand a moment, then serve with cream as milk will spoil even 
good coffee. This recipe makes '5 cups. If a common granite 
ironware or metal coffee pot is used, place a piece of man ilia 
paper in the spout to keep the aroma from escaping; the patetn 
coffee pots are generally air tight. Never use a tin coffee pot. 
Do not attempt to make coffee by cooking the old grounds over 
from time to time, but steep it long enough at first to get all the 
strength out. If coffee is left over it need not be wasted; drain 
it off in a dsih, throw out the grounds, wash and scald the coffee 
pot, then pour in the cold coffee and set it on the stove. Wet . 
some freshly ground coffee with the egg mixture, put it in the 
coffee pot and steep the same as fresh coffee. This will be nice 
even if only a little coffee is added.

CHOCOLATE. 

Sweel chocolate, 12 level ta- | Milk, 1 quart, 

blespoons, | Sugar, 1 tal)lespoon, 

Hot Water, 3 tablespoons. 

Cut chocolate in fine bits. Put milk in double boiler and 
when it is heated to the boiling point, put chocolate, sugar and 
water in a small iron or granite pan and stir over a hot fire until 
smooth and glossy. Stir this mixture into the hot milk and Iwat 
well. Serve at once putting on top of each cup 1 tablespoon of 
whipped cream. 

COCOA. 

Cocoa, 2 tablespoons, Boiling Water, y 2 pint, 

Sugar. '2 tablespoons, | Milk, I 1 - pints, 

Cream, 1 gill. 

Put milk on stove in double boiler. Put cocoa and sugar in 
a sauce pan and gradually pour hot water upon them, stirring 
all the time. Place sauce pan on stove and stir until boiling. 
Le1 boil 5 minutes, then add boiling milk and cream and serve 
hot. The above will make 6 cups. 

EGG NOG. 

For 1 glass of egg nog, separate 1 fresh egg putting white 
in a saucer and yolk in a glass. To yolk add 1 teaspoon sugar 
heating well, then add about 1 tablespoon (according to 
si length) good whisky or brandy, beating all the time. The 
liquor will cook the egg so it will be thick. Fill glass 2-3 full 
with rich milk. Beat white to a froth and stir in the glass. If 
the liquor is not liked, use 1 teaspoon to cook egg, then add wine 
to flavor, or any flavoring extract. Very nutritious for the sick 
or convalescent. 

MULLED BUTTERMILK. 

Stir together 1 tablespoon flour wet smooth with a little 
milk, 1 egg and 1 level teaspoon sugar. Add to 1 quart butter- 
milk. Place on stove and stir until it boils.

PANADA. 

Brown nicely 3 slices of bread and pour over them 1 pint 
boiling water. Let stand until the bread is thoroughly soaked. 
Squeeze all the substance of the bread into the water, sweeten 
to taste and add a little lemon juice, (or any other flavoring de- 
sired), also a suspicion of nutmeg. Serve to the sick in a pretty 
dish. 

RASPBERRY ACID. 

To 3 quarts of red raspberries take 1 quart of vinegar. Mash 
berries and put in a stone jar. Pour vinegar over, cover and stir 
every day for 4 or 5 days keeping in a cool place. Then strain, 
and taking as much sugar as you have juice, boil 10 or 15 min- 
utes. While hot seal air tight. When you wish to use it, take Y> 
glass of the acid to y 2 glass of water or to suit the taste. It is 
very nice to also add shaved ice. This makes a cooling and de- 
licious beverage. 

TEA. 

Tea should be steeped, not boiled. Rinse out the tea pot 
with boiling water, and then put in tea (either green or black) 
allowing 1 heaping teaspoon for 6 cups, or more, according to the 
strength required. Pour on boiling water and set back to steep 
10 minutes. 

ICED TEA. 

Steep tea until well infused. Then strain through cheese 
cloth into stone or earthen vessel. When cold, serve with 
cracked ice, also sugar and cream if desired. 

BEEF TEA. 

Remove all fat and gristle from meat. Lay a piece of 
round steak flat on the table and scrape from both sides all that 
you can, and cut the balance in small pieces. Place in a stew 
pan and add iy 2 pints cold water to 1 pound meat. Set on stove 
and let simmer for 1 hour. The above quantity should make 
nearly 1 pint when done. Add a sprinkling of salt and pepper. 
Strain and serve hot.

Canned Fruit and Preserves 



NOTE ON CANNING FRUITS. 

Have glass cans, lids and rubbers all washed clean. Scald 
cans and lids with hot water, pouring water outside and inside 
at the same time so jars will not crack, and let stand in water to 
thoroughly sweeten. When ready to use, have a pan of hot water, 
dip the jar in, rolling it around, have a cloth to lift it out 
wrapping it around the jar. Hold close to the kettle of fruit 
and fill. Set on table, wipe off, place on rubber and lid. When 
all are done, look them over and turn lids down as tightly as 
possible. Tip upside down and let stand until next morning. Be- 
fore putting away, look them all over again and tighten. 

Use good rubbers. It is best to buy new ones if old ones are 
doubtful. Keep fruit in cold, dark place. Use white granu- 
lated sugar unless otherwise directed. Have fresh fruit and of 
good quality. It is a good plan to use some pint jars, espe- 
cially for berries as a small quantity is often wanted for pud- 
-lings, etc. 

TO CAN FRUIT JUICES. 

Prepare the juice from any kind of fruit the same as for 
jelly. Boil about 5 minutes, then seal boiling hot in glass jars, 
same as fruit. (This is nice for mixing mince meat, flavoring 
puddings, drinks, or making jelly. It retains the flavor and is 
better prepared in this way than to make a large quantity of 
jelly during the summer. It can be turned out and the jelly 
made in a verv few minutes. 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 149 



CANNED BLACKBERRIES. 

To each 1 quart jar allow 1 1-3 quarts of berries, 1 tea cup 
of sugar and about 2 tea cups of water. Enough to fill 3 or 4 
jars can be cooked at a time as they do not mash easily. Cook 
about 8 or 10 minutes. Fill jars and seal. 

CHERRIES. 

Pick over, wash and remove the pits, (either with cherry 
pitter or by hand). To each 1 quart jar allow 1 coffee cup of 
sugar and enough water to make a juice the same as for sauce. 
Cook about 15 minutes and if very ripe not quite so long. Take 
out some to cool and taste and if not sweet enough add more 
sugar. More water can also be added if necessary while cooking. 
Try and fix just as you would to use on the table. Dip in jars 
dividing fruit and juice equally. Seal hot. Enough to fill 3 
jars can be cooked at once. 

LATE CHERRIES 

Proceed the same as above only they require more sugar as 
they are generally quite sour. 

CURRANTS 

Stem currants. To each quart of currants add 1 cup of 
sugar and 1 cup of water. Cook about 5 minutes after they 
begin to boil. Seal the same as other fruit. They can be canned 
without sugar if preferred. 

GOOSEBERRIES 

Pick over Tame or Wild Gooseberries. Put on to cook with 
water to just cover. As soon as hot dip carefully into jars and 
seal. If thoroughly hot they do not need to boil. They will 
not mash up done in this way and retain their flavor much 
better than if sugar is used. When wanted for sauce, turn 
out in kettle, add sugar to taste and let come to boil. Cool 
before serving. For pies, sweeten berries after putting into the 
crust and bake. Wild gooseberries have a very tine flavor when 
full grown or nearly ripe. 



150 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

PLUMS. 

Take large, red. plums before they are quite ripe, just about 
right to peel. Peel as thin as possible with paring knife. Lay 
in porcelain kettle, sprinkle sugar over them, allowing 1 pint 
of sugar to each quart of plums. Cover and let stand until 
morning. Then heat thoroughly, shaking the kettle instead of 
stirring. Cook 5 minutes, dip carefully into jars and seal. If 
not sweet enough use more sugar. Some plums require more 
sugar than others. They are delicious. 

BAKED PEACHES. 

Use good flavored, ripe peaches. Wipe off the down with 
a cloth, do not peel. Lay in a broad granite pan. Strew sugar 
over the top, using 1 quart to 10 or 12 peaches. Set in moderate 
oven and bake iy 2 hours. They are fine, very rich and nice 
color. Serve cold. 

To can the same, have jars ready, dip the peaches care- 
fully in while hot, divide the juice equally and seal immediately. 
When opened you will find them superior to any other method, 
not excepting the old way of making peach preserves. 

PEACHES. 

Pare and cut in halves good, ripe peaches. Place in granite 
kettle and cover with sugar, using about 1 quart of sugar to 2 
quarts of peaches. Turn a plate over them and let stand over 
night. Then place on the stove and let simmer until hot through 
and juice seems rich, Too long cooking will make them soft. If 
not juicy enough add a little water. Carefully lift the peaches 
into the jar filling about 2-3 full, then finish filling with the 
syrup. Seal while hot. 

PEARS. 

I se Bartlett Pears or any good flavored ones. Peel and 
halve, taking out the core. Put in kettle with water to barely 
cover. AHoav 1 cup of sugar to each quart of fruit. Simmer 
until tender but not too soft. Fill jars and seal. 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 151 

BLACK RASPBERRIES. 

The .same as Blackberries. 

RED RASPBERRIES. 

To each 1 quart jar allow 3 pints of berries, 1 coffee cup of 
sugar, y 2 cup of water and % cup of currant juice, (prepared 
as for jell). Put water, sugar and juice in a 4 or 5 quart pan, 
then add the berries. Let them heat thoroughly, just coming to 
the boil. If cooked much they will go to pieces. Shaking the 
pan from side to side will heat them in the juice without stirring. 
You can keep 2 pans going at the same time as it does not take 
so long and they are much nicer to only heat enough in 1 pan 
for one jar at a time. They are the hardest of any fruit to can 
and keep whole. If properly done and the berries are not too 
ripe they will not mash at all. I have tried many ways but like 
this the best. Less currant juice will do but a little is a great 
improvement. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Strawberries shrink more than any other fruit, consequently 
it takes more to fill a jar as they lose color when heated. I 
find dark colored berries the best. Have them fresh. Stem and 
measure and to 2 quarts of berries allow 1 quart of sugar and y* 
cup of water. Put sugar and water in kettle first, then berries. 
Let heat slowly and skim when it begins to boil. Cook about 
y 2 hour, until syrup seems rich. Dip in jars carefully, dividing 
fruit and juice equally. Seal. Strawberries prepared in this 
way can be used for Shortcake. 

TO CAN CORN. 

Cut corn from cob; put in a kettle and cover well with 
water. When it begins to boil, add 1 ounce tartaric acid well 
dissolved in a little hot water to every 6 quarts of corn. Stir 
well and let the corn boil 5 minutes. Seal in glass cans while hot. 
Do not use tin cans. When wanted for the table, pour off sour 
water and cover with fresh water, adding ' 2 teaspoon soda. Let 
stand 1-2 hour, then change water and put it on to 1 >< Â»i 1 1 hour at 



152 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 



least. While boiling add 1 teaspoon sugar and season to taste. 
Be sure to follow this rule and you will enjoy your corn. 

NOTE OK PRESERVES. 

Preserves as made in former days have given way in a 
measure to canned fruits, as these can be made as rich as de- 
sired and arc more healthful than when cooked enough to keep 
without sealing. Jams are much nicer if cooked just right, and 
then scaled in pint cans. Jellies will keep in glass cups or bowls 
as they are made pinl for pint. Paste druggist's white paper 
over the top with white of egg or mucilage. Label each one. 
Keep in cool, dry place. When making jells or jams use white 
granulated sugar ami granite or porcelain kettle and do not 
cook more than I quad or 'â > pints at a time. A small quantity 
will jell better. The quicker it is done, the lighter the color will 
he. Take out a spoonful in a dish after it lias hoiled the given 
lime, cool, and if it begins to jell, take it off. When cold, it will 
he thick enough. For jams, treat the same way as jells. When 
beginning to thicken remove. Seal hot or paste closely with 
paper. Too long conking makes any kind of fruit dark and 
strong. 1 find that rapid boiling (except where simmering is 
directed in recipe) on gas or gasoline stove, with (dose attention. 
gives the besl results. 

APRICOT PRESERVES. 

Do not peel hut wipe off and halve good ripe apricots. To 
! quarts of the halves lake '2 quarts of sugar and 1 pint of water. 
.Make a syrup of the sugar and water and when boiling drop the 
froth off as it rises. Seal while hot. When opened you will 
enjoy a fine flavored preserve. 

QUINCE PRESERVES. 

Wash, peel and cul in quarters or eighths i according to size 
of fruit i ami core. Save cores ami peelings for jell. Weigh the 
fruit and allow 1 pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Put 
fruil in kettle with water enough to cover. Put on lid and cook 
until they seem lender. Try with a fork. They take longer than

apples. Then skim the fruit out in a dish and reserve half of the 
water in the kettle for jell. To the other half add your sugar 
and stir until dissolved. Then pour in the quinces and sinimer 
until the juice is rather thick. When partly cool dip in jars and 
1 taste closely with white paper. If quinces are of strong flavor 
1-3 sweet apples may be used instead of all quinces Prepare 
them the same as quinces but cook them separately. Put together 
when you put them in the syrup. Add the water the apples were 
cooked in to the other for jell. 

RED TOMATO PRESERVES. 

Tomatoes, 6 pounds, | Water, 2V 2 cups, 

Sugar, 5 pounds, j Lemons, 2, 

\Yhole Cloves, 1 tablespoon. 

Scald and peel solid, ripe, meaty tomatoes, the larger the 
better. Cut in about 3 pieces. After all are prepared, drain 
off the juice and weigh tomatoes. Make a syrup with the sugar 
and water, pour over tomatoes boiling hot and let stand until 
next morning. Drain off all the syrup and boil it \' 2 hour, then 
add tomatoes. Let cook until rich and thick. While boiling 
add lemons sliced thin with seeds removed, also add cloves. It 
should be a rich, red color when done. Will keep without sealing 
if pasted up tight. 

YELLOW PEAR TOMATO PRESERVES 

Tomatoes, 10 pounds, | Lemons, 3, 

Sugar, 10 pounds, | Raisins, 1 tea cup, 

Water, 1 quart, | White Ginger Root, 1 / 2 ounce. 

Wash and weigh the tomatoes but do not peel. Make a 
syriip of sugar and water and pour over tomatoes boiling hot 
and let stand until next morning. Drain off the syrup and 
boil about 20 minutes, then pour in the tomatoes. Simmer 2 or 
3 hours, or until the syrup is as thick as for ordinary preserves. 
While cooking, add the lemons sliced 1 1 1 in, (seeds removed), 
raisins and the ginger root which has been bruised with a hammer 
so the strength will be obtained. Let cool before placing in 
jar. Will keep without sealing.

Jells and Jams 



APPLE JELL. 



Use any kind of good, juicy, sour apples. Cut in quar- 
ters but do not peel or core. "Wash and cook rather soft in 
water to barely cover. Pour while hot in bag and drain without 
squeezing. Measure and allow. 1 pint of sugar to each pint of 
juice. Cook about 5 or 8 minutes. It will jell easily if juice 
is tart. If apples are of good flavor no seasoning is required, 
but if not, a thin slice of lemon placed in each glass of jell while 
hot makes it nice. 

CRAB APPLE JELL. 

Wash and cut in halves Transcendent or .small yellow Crab 
Apples or Red Hyslop Crabs. Either makes fine jell. Cover 
with water and cook until rather soft. Pour in bag and drain. 
To each pint of juice allow 1 pint of sugar and cook about 5 min- 
utes. This jells quicker than any other fruit and must be taken 
off as soon as it begins to jell or it will be too stiff. It will thicken 
in a few days even if it does not seem so when you put it away. 
a few days even if it does not seem so when you put it away. 
Dip in glasses while hot. Some apples make a clear, amber jell 
;iih1 others a faint pink tint. 

CURRANT JELL 

Crush red i or white) currants with the hands, (they need 
not be stemmed). When thoroughly mashed squeeze a few at a 
time through a jelly bag. The juice should be a rich red color 
;iikI quite thick. It jells better and is a lighter color thau when 
the fruit is cooked first. To each pint of juice take 1 pint of 
sugar and stir until sugar is dissolved, then let boil about 5 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 155 



minutes. Cool a little in a dish and if it begins to jell take it 
off as it will be thicker when cold. Dip in glasses while hot. Use 
currants before they get too ripe. 

GRAPE JELL. 

Stem and wash any kind of good flavored grapes. If a pink 
jell is desired use grapes about half ripe, if darker use full ripe 
ones. To 8 quarts of grapes add about 2 quarts of water and 
cook until hot through or just to the boiling point. Shake the 
kettle or press the fruit down with a spoon. If stirred, the pulp 
mixes with the juice and is not so clear. Pour in bag and drain 
without squeezing. To each pint of juice take 1 pint of sugar 
and cook about 10 or 15 minutes. It may take a little longer. 
Some grapes jell easier than others. 

GREEN GRAPE JELL. 

Stem green grapes and proceed the same as with ripe ones. 
This makes a light, clear and tart jelly and is nice to serve with 
chicken or meats. 

GOOSEBERRY JELL. 

Wash berries but do not stem them. Put in water enough 
to barely cover and cook until thoroughly hot so the juice will 
run out but do not stir. Pour in bag and hang up to drain 
about y 2 hour or more but do not squeeze. Then measure and 
to each pint of juice take 1 pint of sugar and cook about 10 or 15 
minutes. Cook about 3 pints or 2 quarts at a time. 

WILD GOOSEBERRY JELL. 

The wild berries have a much finer flavor than the tame ones. 
Use berries full grown and it will not matter if part of them 
are turning pink. If riper, the jell will be darker colored but 
good. Proceed the same as with the tame gooseberries. This 
makes a very delicate jell and a lovely light pink color. It is 
superior to any jell I have ever made. 



156 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 



PLUM JELL. 

Pick over and wash red or yellow plums. Put on to cook 
with water to cover and cook without stirring uutil they crack 
opeD and seem soft enough for the juice to run out. Pour in bag 
and drain. Then allow 1 pint of sugar to each pint of juice 
and cook until it jells, which will take about 20 minutes. Cook 
'A pints or 2 quarts at a t ime. 



QUINCE JELL. 

Place quince peelings and cores (see preserves) in kettle 
with water to just cover. Put ou the lid aud cook uutil soft 
or until the juice tastes pretty strong of the quince. Pour in 
hag to drain while hot Then add this juice to the water you 
saved from the preserves and measure, allowing 1 pint of juice 
to 1 pint of sugar aud proceed same as other jell. Cook about 
10 or L5 minutes. The time depends something on the thickness 
of the juice. This is very nice and gets thicker by standing. If 
you use 1 pint of tart apple juice to about 2 quarts of quince juice 
it will jell quicker and is excellent. 



RED RASPBERRY JELL. 

To (I quarts of berries take 1 pint of water. Put in kettle 
and heat through so the juice can be squeezed through jelly bag. 
To each pint of juice allow 1 pint of granulated sugar and - 
tablespoons of currant juice. I it jells better and has a nicer 
flavor by adding the currant juice i. Stir the sugar in the juice 
until dissolved, then boil about 10 minutes, skimming off the 
scum as it rises. 



BLACK RASPBERRY JELL. 

To 1 quarts of berries take 1 pint of water. Hear thoroughly 
and squeeze out the juice. To 2 pints of raspberry juice add 1 
pint of currant juice. To each pint of this mixture add 1 pint 
of sugar. Proceed same as other jell cooking about 15 minutes. 
This makes a dark jell hut very good and not expensive. 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 157 



BLACKBERRY JAM. 

Two quarts of berries, 1 quart of sugar aud 1-2 of water. 
Heat together slowly at first until sugar is melted. Stir with a 
wooden spoon occasionally. Boil rather fast and skim. Cook 
until thick, about 15 or 20 minutes. If you use gas or gasoline 
stove care should be taken or it will burn. It is best to place a 
lid under kettle. Dip in cups or glasses. Blackberries are best 
used alone without adding other fruit or juice. 



CURRANT JAM. 

Stem fresh red or white currants, then squeeze the juice 
from some unstemmed ones. Take 1 quart of stemmed currants 
and 1 quart of juice. Stir the currants and juice together in a 
dish and measure out in your kettle. To each pint of this 
mixture take 1 pint of sugar. . Stir until sugar is dissolved, then 
boil about 10 or 15 minutes. Sometimes it will thicken quicker. 
Skim while cooking. Dip out while hot in glasses or bowls. 
Do not cook more than 2 quarts at a time. 



GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

Pick over green berries, wash and measure. To each quart 
of berries take 1 quart of sugar and 1-2 pint of water. Make a 
syrup of the water and sugar and when hot pour in fruit. Cook 
until rather thick, about 1-2 hour. It will jell and be quite clear. 
Dip in glasses while hot. 



PLUM JAM. 

Use any kind of plums that have a thin skin. Put 4 quarts 
of plums in a kettle with water to just cover. Cook until they 
crack open and are quite soft then add 4 quarts of sugar. Stir 
gently to dissolve the sugar and cook until rather thick. Paste 
up like jell. This is very nice and a pretty color if made of the 
thick meated red plums or Minor plums. 



158 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 



PEACH JAM. 

When putting up peaches it is better to have a good many, 
then take the most perfect ones for preserves or pickles and the 
very ripe, specked ones for jam. Peel and cut in small pieces. 
To 3 quarts of the fruit prepared in this way, add 2 quarts of 
sugar. Put sugar on peaches, cover and let stand over night as 
this will draw out the juice and not require any water. Then 
cook until rich and thick, stirring often to prevent burning. 
Skim while conking. Crack part of the peach pits and blanche 
the kernels the same as almonds. Use about 1 tablespoon of 
kernels to this quantity of fruit. This gives a nice flavor and is 
better put in jars while hot and seal air tight. 

RED RASPBERRY JAM. 

Two quarts of berries, 2 quarts of sugar and 1 pint of 
currant juice, (no water is necessary). Put sugar and juice 
in kettle and stir until sugar is dissolved. Then add berries 
and heat slowly at first, then boil and skim. It will take about 
15 or 20 minutes. It should be thick like jell and a bright red 
color. Dip out while hot in glass or cups. Extra nice. 

BLACK RASPBERRY JAM. 

Three quarts of berries, 3 quarts of sugar and 1 pint of 
currant juice or 1 quart oÂ£ stemmed currants. Stir all together 
and heat slowly at first, then cook faster until rather thick. This 
is easily made and not expensive. Put away same as jell. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. 

Strawberries, 1 heaping pint; sugar, 1 scant pint. Crush 
sugar and berries together, stir thoroughly, then set on to cook. 
Boil rapidly, stirring often and cook 15 or 20 minutes after it 
begins to boil, or until it drops rather thick from the spoon. 
When half done, skim off the froth that is on top. Use small 
granite kettles or pans on gas or gasoline stove, attending to 2 
or 3 at a time as it is much nicer to cook a small quantity at a 
time, 1 pint or 1 quart. Have pint jars ready. When done, dip 
in and seal. If berries are good this will be extra nice.

5piced Fruit and Pickles 



SPICED CURRANTS 



Stem enough fresh, (red or white), ripe currants to make 
2 quarts, then add 2 quarts of currant juice, (the juice can be 
squeezed out the same as for jelly without stemming the cur- 
rants). To each pint of this mixture add 1 pint of granulated 
sugar. Set on stove, stir until the sugar is dissolved and cook 
about 10 minutes or until it jells pretty thick. Cook fast but 
watch it or it will boil over. Cool a little in a dish and if it 
begins to jell it is cooked enough. When done remove from the 
stove and while hot stir in 2 heaping teaspoons of freshly ground 
cinnamon. Dip in cups or glasses and paste white paper over, 
the same as jell. When used tip out on jell dish and serve with 
any kind of fowl or roast. It is delicious. 



SPICED GOOSEBERRIES. 

Pick the stems and blossoms from green but full grown 
gooseberries. For each pint of berries allow 1 pint of granulated 
sugar and 1-2 pint of water. Make a syrup by dissolving the 
sugar in the water on the stove in a granite kettle. When hot, 
pour in the berries and cook until thick like jam. Try the 
same as currants. (They take longer to cook than currants.) 
Remove from stove and while hot stir in 1 heaping teaspoon of 
ground cinnamon. Dip out and paste up the same as currants. 
Serve with cold meats, game or roasts.

SPICED PLUMS. 

Four quarts of red plums cooked rather soft or until they 
crack open. When cool, take out the pits, return to the kettle and 
add the following: 

C Sugar, 4 quarts, Ground Cinnamon, 1 ounce, 

Vinegar. y 2 pint. | Ground Cloves, 1 ounce. 

Cook until pretty thick and paste up like jelly. Serve with 
cold meats. 



BRANDIED PEACHES. 

Steam peaches. Make a syrup of y 2 pound sugar and y 2 tea 
cup of water for each pound of peaches. While cooking, skim 
and then drop in the peaches and cook until tender. Take them 
out carefully and till jars while hot. Remove syrup from fire 
and add to it ^ pint best brandy to every pound of peaches. 
Pour over peaches in cans and seal hot. 

NOTE OX PICKLES. 

Always use porcelain or granite kettles for heating vinegar 
for making pickles of any kind. Use good eider or white wine 
vinegar, as any acid vinegar will eat them and render them soft. 
Do not green them in copper or brass kettles. It is very poison- 
ous. If directions are followed, they will be green. Most pickles 
are better sealed in i â Â» gallon glass jars if to keep long. If not 
sealed, they should b closely covered or pasted with letter paper 
and white of egg. or mucilage the same as jelly. Always use 
whole spices unless recipe calls for ground. When sugar is 
called for, u>e brown or <" sugar. A little horseradish and sugar 
keeps vinegar from spoiling in any kind of pickles. 

PICKLED APPLl.s. 

Pare and quarter Tolman Sweet Apples. Steam and pro- 
ceed the same as with peaches, excepl the (loves for the apples 
are put in the syrup with the other spices. 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 161 



PICKLED CRAB APPLES. 

Tnk perfect Transcendent Crab Apples. Do not peel or re- 
move the stem but wash and steam rather tender. Proceed the 
same as with peaches, except the cloves for the crab apples are 
put in the syrup with the other spices. Use fruit not too ripe. 

PICKLED CAULIFLOWER. 

Cauliflower, 2 heads, Yellow Ground Mustard, 1 tea- 

Salt, 1 pint, cup, 

Sugar, 1 tea cup, | Vinegar, 2 quarts. 

Use large, white heads of cauliflower. Place them in a jar, 
sprinkle over them the salt and add enough cold water to cover. 
Lei stand over night, then wash and break off any outside leaves 
but do not break apart. Place in a steamer or steam cooker and 
steam about 15 minutes or until it seems a little tender; try with 
a fork and be careful not to let it get too soft. Let cool, then 
separate the pieces where the divisions are and place them in 
glass jars. Put the vinegar in a granite kettle and when boiling, 
add the sugar, then the mustard which has been previously wet 
smooth with cold vinegar and stir until it thickens. If it seems 
at all lumpy strain through a wire sieve. While hot, dip enough 
of this mixture over the cauliflower to cover, then seal. 

SPICED CAULIFLOWER. 

Cauliflower, 2 heads, | Stick Cinnamon, 1 tablespoon, 
Red Cayenne Pepper Pods, 2 j Allspice, 1 tablespoon, 
Vinegar, 2 quarts, | White Mustard Seed, 1 table- 
Sugar, 1 pint, | 'uoods 
Cloves, 1 tablespoon, | Celery Seed, 1 tablespoon. 

Prepare the cauliflower the same as for Pickled Cauliflower. 
Place in jar with pepper pods, allowing 2 pods to each quart 
jar, or use small pieces of red bell pepper. Boil the vinegar, 
sugar and spices together 30 minutes, then while hot dip it over 
the cauliflower enough to cover, and seal. This makes a delicious 
pickle. If this quantity of vinegar does not cover the cauliflower 
you wish to spice you will have to prepare more.

CELERY PICKLE. 

Green Tomato, y 2 peck, Sugar, 1 cup, 

Cabbage, 1 small head, j Salt, l / 2 cup, 

' 'elery, 1 bunch, j Celery Heed, 1 ounce, 

Vinegar, j Mustard Seed, 1 ounce. 

Chop tomatoes fine, stir through them the sail and let stand 
over night. Squeeze out dry and put in kettle, then add the cab- 
bage and celery, (both of which have been chopped fine), celery 
seed, mustard seed, sugar and enough cider vinegar to cover. Let 
come to a boil stirring thoroughly. Seal air tight while hot. 
Very nice. 

CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

To 1(10 small cucumbers, add 1 pint fine salt dissolved in 
boiling water and pour on them hot. There should l>e enough of 
this brine to cover the pickles. Let stand 24 hours, turn off and 

rinse pickles. Then dissolve in boiling water a piece of alum 
the size of an egg, pour on the pickles hot and let stand 6 bonis. 
Pour off and rinse pickles, then scald enough of the best ^â \^\^>v 
vinegar to cover them. Spice with i â¢_, ounce each of cloves, cin- 
namon and white mustard seed and 1 cup sugar. Put this on the 
pickles boiling hot and von will have brittle pickles. 

SOUR CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

I have found it convenient to make pickles by the following 
method as it seems easier in the fall when the weather is cool or 
even later when all other pickling and preserving is out of the 
way. Take small green cucumbers, wash and place in a large jar 
or t nl> quite a thick layer of them, t hen a layer of coarse salt, then 
cucumbers and so on until all are used. Tie up or cover with a 
lid. No water is necessary. More cucumbers can be added at 
any time. They will shrivel but they keep their green color. 
, \Yhen ready to fix them take all or part of them, put in large 
pan, cover with cold water and set on the stove. As the water 
heats it will draw out the salt and the pickles will swell out to 
their natural size. When real hot pour off this water, put on 
fresh and repent 3 or 1 t hues, then s et by and let stand until fresh 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 163 



enough to be palatable â 1 or 2 days â then take out on a cloth to 
drain. Place in 2 quart fruit jars with 2 or 3 small red peppers 
and 3 or 4 pieces of horseradish to each jar. Pour in a kettle as 
much good cider vinegar as you think will cover the quantity you 
have and add 1 cup of brown sugar to each 2 quarts of vinegar. 
When boiling hot pour over pickles and sea 1 while hot. They 
will be green and brittle and keep well. 

SPICED CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

Fill your jars with pickles after they have been freshened 
as for the sour pickle. Make a spiced vinegar of the following: 

Vinegar, 2 quarts, | Allspice, 1 tablespoon, 

Brown Sugar, 2 cups, j Pepper, 1 tablespoon, 

Cloves, 1 tablespoon, Celery Seed, 1 tablespoon, 

Cinnamon. 1 tablespoon, j Mustard Seed, 1 tablespoon. 

Mace, 1 tablespoon. < 

Boil all together 10 or 15 minutes. Dip over the pickles hot 
dividing the spices in each jar. Seal at once. If preferred to 
make pickles in Summer when first gathered place in a jar 1 cup 
of coarse salt and pour on this 1 gallon of boiling water. While 
still hot put in the cucumbers and let stand over night. Then 
take out and rinse off brine and lay mi cloth to drain while you 
are preparing the vinegar. If both sour and spiced pickles are 
wanted, fill jars and prepare the vinegar and proceed the same 
as in the above recipe. 

DILL PICKLES. 

Take medium size cucumbers, wash them and let them lay in 
cold water about 2 hours. Put a layer of grape leaves and a little 
dill in the bottom of a large stone jar, then a layer of cucumbers 
and sprinkle over this a very few cloves, allspice, thin slices of 
red pepper and some dill, then another layer of cucumbers, 
spices, peppers and dill and so on until the jar is full. Put a 
layer of dill on top. Make a brine of cold water and salt strong 
enough to flqat an oiX'^, then add cold water until the egg slowly 
sinks to the bottom, then add 1 tea cup of vinegar and pour over 
the pickles. Cover with a cloth, pu1 a plate on top and a weight

RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 



to keep them under the brine. They must be kept in a warm place 
for a week, then you can remove them to the cellar. Will be 
ready for use in about 10 days after making. Once a week the 
cloth must be washed in cold water and all scum carefully re- 
moved. 



HODGE PODGE PICKLE. 



Sliced Cucumbers, 1 gallon, 
Shredded Cabbage, 1 gallon, 
Medium Sized Onions, 4, 
Green Bell Peppers, 2, 
Salt, 2 tablespoons, (a little 
heaping), 



White Sugar, 2 coffee cups, 
Yellow Mustard, 1 coffee cup, 
Black Mustard Seed, 1 ounce 
White Mustard Seed, 1 ounce, 
Celeiw Seed, 1 ounce, 
Vinegar. 



Take cucumbers about half as large as for ordinary slicing. 
Slice medium thin without peeling. Put in granite pan with 
shredded cabbage and stir in the salt. Peel onions and slice. Re- 
move seeds from peppers and slice crosswise. Add this all to- 
gether with sugar. Pour in enough good cider vinegar to wet 
thoroughly. Set on stove and when hot stir in mustard prev- 
iously wet smooth in cold vinegar. Add the seeds. Stir all to- 
gether thoroughly and let come to a boil. More sugar can be 
added if you wish it sweeter. While hot seal air tight in glass 
fruit jars. This makes a delicious pickle. 



PEPPER MANGOES. 

Take large, green, Bell Peppers, cut the top off round leav- 
ing on the stem, this forms a lid. Scrape out the seeds, lay in salt 
water over night using 1 cup of salt to a pail of water. Then tip 
out on a tray or board upside down to drain. For the filling, 
chop very fine, fresh cabbage and to each gallon measured after 
it is chopped add the following: 



Sugar, 1 tea cup, | White Mustard 

Red Bell Pepper, chopped | tablespoon, 

rather fine, 1, | Black Mustard 

Salt, 1 level tablespoon, tablespoon, 

Celery Seed, 1 level tablespoon. 



Seed, 1 level 
Seed, 1 level 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 165 



Mix altogether and let stand about an hour. Then with 
your hands squeeze out as dry as possible. Stuff the pepper full 
pressing in all it will hold, then place on a lid that will fit or 
nearly so and stick wooden tooth picks down through the lid into 
the mango, (this is quicker done than tying or sewing), using 3 
tooth picks to each mango. Place in a 2 or 3 gallon stone jar, 
fit in as closely as possible but do not fill jar too full, leaving 
room for plate, an'd weight. Lay several roots of horse radish on 
top and add % cup sugar to each jar as this keeps the vinegar 
from spoiling. Turn a plate over the mangoes and pour on good 
cider vinegar to cover. They must be kept under the vinegar 
and if the plate is not heavy enough put on a small weight. Tie 
down closely with thick paper and set in a cool place. Will keep 
a year. When wanted for use remove the picks and lid and place 
mangoes in a pickle dish. 

GREEN MUSKMELON MANGOES. 

Wash melons, pare thin as possible, cut out 1 or 2 sections 
and remove the seeds. Put melons in salt water over night, using 
1 tea cup of salt to 2 gallons of water. Then take 1 quart of 
vinegar and 2 quarts of water and cook melons in this until you 
can just run a fork in nicely, take out and drain putting more in 
to rook. For the filling, chop very fine fresh cabbage and to each 
gal lor. measured after it is chopped add the following: 

Sugar, 1 cup. 

Salt, 1 level tablespoon, 

Whole Cloves, 1 level tablespoon. 

As you stuff each melon with this filling lay in 4 very small 
cucumber pickles, 4 green radish pods and 4 green nasturtium 
seeds. Put the sections in place and tie with wrapping twine. 
Place in stone jar and pour over them the following boiling hot : 

Vinegar, 1 gallon, | Whole Cloves, 2 tablespoons, 

Whole Cinnamon, 2 table- j White Ginger Root, 1 table- 
spoons, spoon, 
Sugar, 5 pounds. 

Boil all together 20 minutes. Let melons stand 2 days, drain 
off liquor and boil. If not strong enough add more vinegar. Pour 



166 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 



over mangoes hot. Put on a plate and tie up the same as pepper 
mangoes. When served cut mangoes in halves and put in pickle 

dish. 

MU'SKM EL< >N SWEET PICK LE. 

Cut the melon in I he gores lengthwise. Peel, scrape out the 
inside, lay in a stone jar, cover with good cider vinegar and let 
stand until the next day. Then drain off the vinegar and meas- 
ure. Make a sjTup of the following proportion : 

Vinegar, 1 quart, Whole Cloves, 1 tablespoon, 

Brown Sugar, 3 pounds, Slick Cinnamon, 1 tablespoon. 

Mace, 1 tablespoon. 

Drop half of the melon in this syrup and cook slowly until 
clear, then remove the pieces with a silver fork to a platter, then 
cook the rest of the melon. When all is done, place in glass or 
stone jars, cook the syrup a little longer, (not too thick) strain 
and pour over the melon. Put a few pieces of each kind of spice 
in each jar and throw away (he rest, as too many spices will make 
the melon dark. If the syrup cooks away so there is not enough 
t<Â» cook all of the melon, add more sugar and vinegar. There 
should be enough syrup to cover the melon in the jars. Use 
melons about half ripe or they will mash. Can be made after 
the melon season is over. They are very nice and will keep a 
long time. They need not be air tight. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 

Small White French Onions, | Salt, 1/2 CU P, 

Water, 2 quarts, White Sugar, L /2 ( ' U P> 

While Wine Vine-vr, 1 fjiiart,| Mace, LÂ» blades. 

Red Cayenne Pepper Tods, 3,| Cloves,! teaspoon. 

Peel onions and throw them in cold water. When all are 
ready, wash them out of this water and put them in a kettle 
with the 2 quarts of water and the salt, and scald the onions in 
this about 10 minutes or until they are a little tender; be \ory 
careful not to have them soft, as the success of the pickle de- 
pends on this part of the formula. Skim out to drain in a sieve. 
More onions can be cooked in the same water. Place onions 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 167 

in glass jars with pepper pods, or small pieces of red bell pepper 
can be used if you cannot get the pods. Boil together a few min- 
utes the vinegar, sugar, mace and cloves, then while 
hot pour it over the onions enough to cover, and seal. If this 
quantity is not enough to cover the onions you wish to pickle, 
you will have to prepare more. 

PICKLED PEACHES. 

Pare good peaches without specks and not too ripe. Stick 
2 cloves iii each and lay in a steamer, filling it y 2 or 2-3 full. 
Steam about 10 minutes or until a little tender (try with fork 
or broom straw). If hard or green ones are used it will take 
longer. Lift your steamer off in a pan on the table. Have your 
jars (1 or 2 quart fruit jars) previously ready. With a spoon 
carefully lift the peaches into tin 1 jars. Do not fill too full or 
they will mash. Then fill each jar with tin 1 following hot syrup 
and seal air tight : 

Vinegar, 1 quart, | Stick Cinnamon, broken up, 

Sugar, 2 quarts, 1 tablespoon, 

('assia I>uds, 1 tablespoon. 

It is best to prepare tin- syrup while peeling the peaches. 
Let it boil t 2 hour or more, until it is like thin syrup. 2 quarl 
jars are nice to use as they will keep opened in winter until 
used. The syrup should cover the fruit. This quantity will be 
sufficient for 4 quarts of fruit. If not enough for what fruit is 
ready cover jars with a (doth to keep warm while you make more. 
If any is left put it by for another time and reheat it before us- 
ing. The better the flavor of the peaches the nicer they will he. 
To some housekeepers this formula may seem more work than 
the old way of boiling the syrup and pouring it over the fruit, 
l-ut it is far superior and well pays for the trouble. 

PICKLED PEARS. 

Peel, halve or quarter pears, according to size. Steam 

until tender and proceed the same as with peaches, except the 
cloves for the pears are put in the syrup with the other spices. 
Different spices may be used according to taste. 



168 RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 



PICCALILLI. 

Chop separately and rather fine, green tomatoes and good 
solid cabbage. Take about equal measures of each. To 1 gallon 
of this mixture take 1 heaping tablespoon of salt. Stir all 
through and let stand over night. Then pour in a colander or 
â¢ loth to drain, squeezing out all of the water. Put in granite 
or porcelain kettle and pour on enough good cider vinegar to 
wet it thoroughly. 

To each gallon of this add the following: 

Brown Sugar, 1 coffee cup, | Celery Seed, 1 tablespoon, 
White Mustard Seed, 1 table-' Black Mustard Seed, 1 table- 
spoon, spoon, 
Large Red Bell Peppers, 2. 

Remove the seeds from peppers and chop rather tine. Heat 
all together thoroughly hot, stirring occasionally. Seal part of 
this air tight to use later, and the remainder tie up closely in a 
stone jar for present use. 

RIPE TOMATO PICKLES. 

Ripe Tomatoes, | Cinnamon, 2 ounces, 

Water, 1 gallon. Cloves, 2 ounces. 

Coarse Salt, 1 pint, | Allspice, 2 ounces, 

Brown Sugar, 1 pint, ; Black Pepper, 2 ounces. 

Horse Radish, several pieces, | Red Bell Peppers, 2. 

Cider Vinegar. 

Select smooth, solid, ripe tomatoes and lay them in the 
gallon of water with the salt for 2 or 3 days. Take out and 
drain, then pack closely in a stone jar, putting in the spices, 
peppers and sugar in layers as you fill the jar. Put horseradish 
on top and pour in cold vinegar enough to cover. Then put on 
a thick layer of grape leaves and turn on a plate to keep them 
under the vinegar. Paste up like jell, then tie a thick brown 
paper over it and keep in a cool place. 

GREEN TOMATO PICKLE. 
Wash and slice about 1 - inch thick, j - bushel of large green 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 169 



tomatoes. Put in a large pan or kettle and pour on enough 
water to cover. Add 1 teacup of salt and let them get hot and 
scald thoroughly, as this takes out the green poison and softens 
them. Skim out on a cloth stretched over a pan or tub and let 
drain for several hours over night. Then with your hand place 
in stone jars first a layer of tomatoes, then some whole spices, 
using cinnamon, cloves, allspice and pepper, about 1 ounce of 
each spice to each gallon of tomatoes. Finish on top with a little 
ground cinnamon. Then take 2 quarts of good cider vinegar and 
5 pounds of brown sugar, boil together y 2 hour and pour boiling 
hot over the tomatoes. Turn a plate over to keep them under 
the syrup, tie up closely and they will be ready for use in a week. 
Tomatoes shrink so much after scalding in the salt water that it 
takes a good many to make a gallon. Think y 2 bushel will make 
nearly 2 gallons. These will keep any length of time. 



WATER MELON SWEET PICKLE. 

Cut in pieces about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide, the 
solid part of the melon. Cook in slightly salted water until 
just tender enough to pierce with a broom straw. Skim out in 
colander or sieve to drain, then place in a stone jar. Make a 
syrup of the following : 

Vinegar, 1 quart, | Whole Cloves, 1 tablespoon, 

Sugar, 3 pounds, | Stick Cinnamon, 1 tablespoon, 

Mace, 4 blades. 

Boil this all together a few minhtes, then pour over the melon 
and let stand over night. Then pour off the syrup and let it 
come to a boil, add half of the melon and cook until clear. With 
;> silver fork lift the pieces out on a platter and put the rest of 
the melon in the syrup. If there is not enough syrup to cook 
this more vinegar and sugar will have to be added. Place the 
pieces in your jars and pour the syrup over this. There should 
be enough syrup to cover the melon. They need not be air 
tiuht.

Miscellaneous Recipes 



TO BLANCH ALMONDS OR PEANUTS. 

Shell, then pour on enough hot water to cover them and 
let them stand a few minutes until the skin will slip off easily. 
Pour off the water and slip off the skins with your fingers. 



SALTED ALMONDS. 

Shelled Almonds, 1 pint, | Butter, 1 heaping tablespoon, 

Salt, 1 heaping tablespoon. 

Blanch the almonds, (see recipe). Put the butter in a tin 
pan and set on stove to melt, but do not brown. Put in the 
almonds and stir the butter through them, then set in mod- 
erate oven to brown. Stir occasionally until they are a nice 
light brown, then remove from the oven and sprinkle over them 
the salt, stirring it through thoroughly. Turn out on white or 
yellow paper which will absorb the grease. 

SALTED PEANUTS. 

Buy raw peanuts and set in the oven a few minutes, (per- 
haps 5 minutes, according to the heat of the oven), as this will 
make them shell easier. Shell, then blanch and salt them the 
same as almonds. 

BUTTERED CROUTONS. 

Spread thinly with butter, stale slices of bread. Cut in small 
squares, place in pan butter side up and brown in a quick oven. 
Serve with soup. 



RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 173 



BREAD CRUMBS. 

These can be prepared at any time and kept on hand in 
a tin box. Place pieces of dry bread (the harder the better), 
in a pan in the oven until light brown. Place on thick paper 
and powder with rolling pin until very fine. They are better 
put through a course sieve, saving finer part for oysters and 
croquettes, and the rest for other things. Throw away all pieces 
which will not roll fine. 

BREAD STICKS. 

Take pieces of bread when it is light enough to put in the 
pan to bake. Roll into strips about the size of your finger. Put 
them in a grooved pan made for the purpose, let them raise a 
little and bake; as soon as they are done, turn them out of the 
pan and rub them all over with melted butter. 

CHEESE STRAWS. 

Flour, 3 tablespoons, | Milk, 1 tablespoon, 

Cheese, 3 " grated, | Salt, y 2 saltspoon, 

Butter, 1 tablespoon, | Cayenne, yÂ± saltspoon, 

Yolk of Egg, 1. 

Mix dry ingredients, and add milk, yolk of egg and butter. 
Mix all well with a spoon and when smooth divide in 2 parts. 
Bake in a slow oven 15 minutes. May be served hot or cold, 
piled on plate log cabin style. 

CHEESE CRACKERS. 

Place a quantity of buttered Saratoga Flakes in baking pan 
with 1 heaping teaspoon of grated cheese on each one. Dash 
a pinch of cayenne pepper over them and bake 5 minutes in 
hot oven, a little brown. Serve with salads. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

One-half cup butter and 2 tablespoons flour creamed. Pour 
on 1/2 pi n t boiling water. Let cook about 10 minutes. If too 
thick, add a little more water.

TO KEEP EGGS FOR WINTER USE. 

I have tried various methods and many recipes for 30 years 
or more and I pin my faith to the following: If the eggs are 
fresh when put in they will conic out so. I have made Angel 
Food and other cakes in March, with eggs put up in this way 
in the previous September. Take unslacked lime and break up 
in small pieces so you can measure it in a coffee cup. To 1 cup of 
lime take 1 cup of coarse barrel salt and 1 gallon of boiling- 
water; a keg, stone jar or lard firkin is good for the purpose. 
.Measure in the Mine and sal!, and pour on the boiling water; let 
stand until cold, then with your hand let the eggs carefully down 
in the liquid. 4 or 5 gallons will cover a good many eggs. They 
can be put in at any time as you gather them, only so the liquid 
covers them. A light board is good to keep them under the 
brine. 

BROWNED FLOUR. 

Place 1 or l' quarts of wheal Hour in a dripping pan, set it in 
;â  moderate oven, and let heat through, stirring it several times. 
Watch carefully until it is a nice brown, do not burn it and 
do not add anything to it. When cool put in a tin or glass can. 
It is nice for gravies as they are more quickly made, are a better 
color, and do not have a raw taste as when made with flour the 
usual way. For fried or fricasseed chicken the white flour is 
best. 

TO PREPARE PAT FOR FRYING < >YSTERS, DOUGHNUTS, 
FRITTERS, CROQUETTES, ETC. 

Cut up in rather small pieces 5 pounds of beef suet, and 
put in kcitlc with 1 pint water. Cook y_> hour, remove cover 
and try out slowly until it looks clear, just as you would lard. 
Strain through a tine cloth. Add to this twice as much (Sinclair's 
Fidelity) lard so as to have 1-3 suet and 2-3 (Sinclair's Fidelity i 
lard. Place on the stove, and when hot add 1 large unpeeled 
apple and 1 potato sliced, also 1 tablespoon salt. Fry until 
brown and skim out pieces. This gives it a nice flavor. Anything
