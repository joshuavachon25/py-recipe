What is 



Cottolene is a pale yellow material, of 

the consistency, texture and substance 

Cottolene? of lard. It approximates at times the 

--^ color of natural butter. It is almost 

without odor, and has a neutral flavor to the taste. It 
is packed like lard, in tin pails of different sizes in 
twenty-pound wooden buckets, in sixty-pound painted 
wooden tubs, and m regular tierces. - 

Cottolene is a simple preparation of cotton-sced o.l 
and beef fat. It contains no other material. It con- 
tains no salt, no water, and no coloring matter, t 
meets the public demand for a pure, healthful, diges - 
ible substitute for swine fat. It is to be sold for exactly 
what it is, and not under the name or in imitation of 

any other article. , n . » 

The name Cottolene is duly registered in the Pa ent 
Office of the United States, and is fully protected by 
leners therefrom. All persons are therefore warned 
against infringement upon vested rights, an.l notice is 
hereby given that imitator' "."". be promptly prosecuted 
.-> tVip fullest extent of the law. 



\«^a 



How TO Use Cottolene. 

rviRECTlONS for the use of Cottolene arc very simple. 
^^ Use it for all purposes exactly the same as lard ; 
but it is not necessary to use over two-thirds as much; 
otherwise, it is wasted. In frying, be sure to have the 
griddle cold when the Cottolene is put in. Two-thirds 
of a pound of Cottolene will do the work of one pound 
of lard. Thus by using Cottolene you save just one- 
third the cost. 




Life and Health depend upon wholesome, digest- 

ible food. Food to be easilv di- 

gested must be properly prepared. This means good 
cooking, and a good cook must have healthful, fine 
flavored materials. People are everywhere awaking to 
the importance of greater care in the selection of food 
materiais.

IDEA," MAY. i«92.

Cottolene.— This »ew and hygienic substitute for that curse 
of the kilch«;n-lar(l-is made of the best of beef suet and purest 
cotton-seed oil. Housekeepers of even average common 
sense know that these materials are not only harmless, but that, 
if any kind of fat is necessary for human consumption, these 
are the best that can be found. I.ard lias produced more scrof- 
ula, made more dyspeptics, and spoiled more complexions than 
any other substance ever used, and now there is happily no 
further necessity for it. Lard heretofore has been almost indis- 
pensable in the construction of pie crust and for fryirg purposes. 
But Cottolene does all this work better and without danger to 
health. Cottolene is also a perfect substitute for butter. This 
last most expensive cooking luxury need uo longer be added to 
pie crust, molasses cake, etc., etc. It does not take as much Cot- 
tolene for pie crust as lard, and now one can eat a piece of well- 
made pie without the fear of blotches and trichitiosis before 
one's eyes. Cottolene will do everything that lard and butter 
have done, and without injury. 



RECIPE FOR MAKING AND COOKING 
DOUGHNUTS. 

1 Quart of flour. 

2 Rounding tcaspoonfuls baking powder. 
1 Cup of milk. 

I Cup sugar. 

I Saltspconful ground nutmeg or cinnamon. 

1 Saltspoonful salt. 

2 Eggs. 

I Tablespoonful Cottolcne (after it has been melted.) 

Sift the flour, salt, spice and baking powder together, 
beat the eggs adding sugar, milk and me^ed Cottolcne, 
stir into the flour, roll and cut into shape. Have the 
kettle* 3/ full of Cottolcne. (When the fat is hot 
enough a piece of dough dropped into it will rise to the 
top and brown). Drop in the doughnuts and fry for 
three minutes. 



CROQUETTES OF RICB. 



K pint of millc 
I lemon. 
4 eggs. 



K lb. of rice. 
3 ounces of Coltolene. 
3 out?ccs of suj^ar. 
3 ounces of bread crumbs. 

Soak the rice for twenty-four hours. Put it into a saucepan or 
the farinp boikr with two ounces of the Cottolcne and the 
milk. Stew it un.il quite tender, grate the rind of the lemon 
into it, stir in the sugar and three whisked eggs, and turn it out 
on a dish till cold. Now mould it into balls or flat cakes, whisk 
•up the other egg, dip the balls in, roll them in the bread crumbs, 
and fry in the u A of the Cottolene (lK)iling) to a nice golden 
color. Macaroni or hominy can be used instead of rice.

A Vegetable Lard as a PacV 'ng house lard as now manu- 

. """^ factured is a highly objectionable 

Substitute for the food product, it is a question whether 
— jjQg jj^j.^j ^j. ground out and melted up 

Animal Material in our large modern packing houses, lo- 
cated at the different stock yards of the 
United States, is either healthful or clean. Cottolene, on the 
other hand, is pure, refined and clarified cotton-seed oil with an 
admixture of choice selected beef suet. It contains no other in- 
gredients, anu is recommended and endorsed by the most emi- 
nent physicians and chemists as far more wholesome and 
digestible than lard. 



MARION A. McBRIDE, in "The Cottage Hearth" for 
riav, 1892, under "Domestic Science." 



Cottolene.- There is another new and important (iictor in 
cooking. Many articles need a crisp touch, or something to 
make the other ingredients more harmonious, and it is not every 
cook who can use butter of the best quality for all cooking. It is 
right here that the danger lies. The housekeeper thinks she 
cannot afford the best grade of an article and yet fancies she 
nnist have that article at all hazards. 

I,ard and pork have been stand-bys .so long, and there are .so 
many ])laccs where they seem to be necessary, that their (iuality 
is important. Still inider the very best possible conditions the 
grease is unhcfilthy, and its faults cannot be overlooked ; in fact, 
people who are at all sensitive cannot eat food containing those 
ingredients. 

Cottolene is a preparation which comes into the market to 
meet just this need. The product is made of cotton-seed oil and 
beef suet, is the same consistency as larcJ", and looks like it, ex- 
cept in color, which is creamy. 

Cottolene is delicate in preparation and is used in place of lard 
or butter in cooking. For frying it is unsurpassed, as a rich 
brown color is easily secured. There is not the least suggestion 
of extra fat, but a crisp, fine finish, very pleasing in fish, cakes, 
fried cereals, oysters or clam^:. ^ 

A peculiarity of this preparation is that while food seems rich 
there is no fatly taste to disturb the digeslion, and foi this rea- 
son it has been very popular wherever used.

SARATOGA CHIPS.

cold water for one hour and a half, then thoroughly dry with 
clean towel. Drop each slice separately in kettle of boiling Cot

•; WE ALWAYS FRY OURS IN C0TT0LENE.''-Our Meat. 

Fish, Oysters, vSaratoga Chips, Eggs, Doughnuts, Vegetables, 
etc. Like most other people, our folks formerly used lard for all 
such purposes. When it disagreed with any of the family 
',VV"^ll 'V^^^^" ^^i^l) ^ve said it was t(y) rich. Wc finally tried 
COTTOLENE and not one of us has had an attack of" richness " 
since. We further found that, unlike lard, Cottolene had no un- 
pleasant odor when cookimr. and lastlv mothrr's ff.vnritf. anH 
conservative cooking authority came out and gave it a big 
recommendation which clinched the matter. So that's why we 
always fry ours in Cottolene. 



The Editor of one of the great metropolitan 
newspapers in the West writes as follows: 



*' No lard is more wholesome than any or all 
lard. The introduction of a pure, sweet, pal- 
atable substitute for 'hog fat' is a positive 
benefit to mankind. Rapid advances have been made 
in the past twenty-five years in the use and acceptance 
of olive oil as a substitute for animal grease. Why 
may not Cottolene win its way far more rapidly by 
reason of its greater economy as a food ingredient ? 
* Education will do it.'"

One cup Cottolene, three cups of flour, a little salt. Sift the 
flour and the salt and rub in the shortening. Use enough ice

from you. One-third of the above quantity is enough for one pie.

A proof that COTTOLENE is especially adapted to bakers' 
use, and to the requirements of home, is that it will "cream up" 
like butter. Take two-thirds (^^) as much Cotto'cne as is ordi 
narily used of butter, and the proper quantity of sugar, and a 
few moments' rubbing together will convince the most .'•keptical 
that Cottolene is a perfect su\)stitute for butter in cake making. 
We call special attention to the rich flavor and odor of the Cotto- 
lene when thus treated. Another advantage is that it will not 
only cream up much quicker than butter, but being free from 
salt it does not have to be washed. This results in a saving uf 
time aud labor.

Frying, though one of the most common of culinary oocra- 

tions ,s one that is least commonly performed well. It often 

results in burning the outside whilst the inside is cold, or in 

serving the article in a coating of grease. It is very important 

hat the Cottolene should be heated up to cooking pointSJore 

Th' r^ , ' '"i ?T '"• '''" "'""""' ''''''' ^^^« '''-^^^'y ^» this point. 
1 here should be enough to immerse the article to be fried If 
too many things are put in the frying basket they will be !>adly 
dune, because tlie temperature of the Cottolene will fall below 
the point necessary to treat properly. The temperature should 
nsc lour or five degrees during the process. Cottolene gives 
much better results than lard. ^ 

The temperature of the Cottolene should vary according to the 
nature of the things fried. To ascertain when it is of proper 
hea throw in a little bit of bread-if it browns quickly it is 
ready ; if it burns the bread, it is too hot. For fish poUtoel 
crcxiuettes and rissoles the Cottolene must be very ^^Trke

COTTOLENE TAKES THE LEAD among cooking 
_ __ _ . . MATERIALS . . 

Because pies, biscuits and pastry are better flavored more 
delicious and more nutritious than food prepared with lard 
We also include everything fried, such as potatoes, eggs, Hsh. 
mush, hominy, etc., etc. 

Everybody knows that vegetable fcxxi is, in the long run far 
more readily assimilated by the digestion than animal pro<lucts 
Cottolene is essentially a vegetable preparation, and is guaran- 
teed to be a sure preventive of dyspepsia.
