From the Economist. 



This is a useAil and practical little 
book, with plidn directions for making 
bread on the smallest and simplest scale, 
and which may encourage the most in- 
experienced to venture on a trial of home- 
Modtf bread, in the superiority of which 
to the general run of bakers' bread we 
heartiW agree with Hiss Acton : but it 
must oe ffood home-made bread: very 
atrocious combinations under thai name 
having presented themselves in our own 
limitoa en)erience. This, however. Miss 
Acton in the book before us does her best 
to remedy; and if her clear and sen- 
sible rules are closely followed, we feel 
sure that the result will be satisfactory, as 
mudi in an assthetic as an economical 
point of view. We fear that the art of 
bread-making does not rank so univer* 



sally amongst modem female accom- 
plishments as could be wished, and thoui^h 
we do not go quite so fiu: as Mr. Oobbett. 
who says that everv woman, high and 
low, ought to know how to make oreaii ; 
ifnedo not, elke i$ a mere burden upon 
the eommunitv; yet we quite agree with 
him in deploring the general ignorance on 
the subject which is (bund among the 
women of the labouring olassea, especiallv 
in the southern counties of Euglano. 
There is no doubt that the bread bill- 
that formidable item In a poor man's 
housekeeping expenditure — might be 
greatly reduced l^ the adoption of the 
practice of making bread at home. We 
wish Miss Acton's book the circulation 
and sncceas that tt deserves.

PREFACE. 



It cannot be denied that an improyed system of practical 
domestic cookery, and a better knowledge of its first prin- 
ciples, are stiU much needed in this countxy ; where, from 
ignorance, or from mismanagement in their preparation, the 
daily waste of excellent provisions almost exceeds belief. 
This waste is in itself a very serious evil where so large a 
portion of the community often procure — as they do in 
England — ^with painful difficulty, and with the heaviest labour, 
even sufficient bread to sustain existence; but the amount 
of pontive disease which is caused amongst us by improper 
food, or by food rendered unwholesome by a bad mode of 
cooking it, seems a greater evil still. The influence of diet 
upon health is indeed a subject of far deeper importance than 
it would usually appear to be considered, if we may judge 
by the profound indifference with which it is commonly 
treated. It has occupied, it is true, the earnest attention of 
many eminent men of science, several of whom have recently 
investigated it with the most patient and laborious research, 
the results of which they have made known to the world in 
their writings, accompanied, in some instances, by information 
of the highest value as to the most profitable and nutritious 
modes of preparing various kinds of viands. In arranging 
the present enlarged edition of this volume for publication, 
I have gladly taken advantage of such of their instructions 
^those of Baron Liebig especially) as have seemed to me 
adapted to its character, and likely to increase its real utility. 
These, I feel assured, if carefully followed out, will much 
assist our progress in culinaiy art, and diminish the unneces 



VUl PREFACE. 

saiy degree of 'expenditure which has hitheirfx) attended it8 
operations ; for it may safely be averred that good cookery is 
the best and truest economy, turning to full account every 
wholesome article of food, and converting into palatable 
meals, what the ignorant either render uneatable, or throw 
away in disdain. It is a popular error to imagine that what 
is called good cookery is adapted only to the establishments 
of the wealthy, and that it is beyond the reach of those who 
are not affluent. On the contrary, it matters comparatively 
little whether some few dishes, amidst an abundant variety, 
be prepared in their perfection or not; but it is of the utmost 
consequence that the food which is served at the more simply 
supplied tables of the middle classes should all be well and 
skilfully prepared, particularly as it is from these classes that 
the men principally emanate to whose indefatigable industry, 
high intelligence, and active genius, we are mainly indebted 
for our advancement in science, in art, in literature, and in 
general civilisation. 

When both the mind and body are exhausted by the toils of 
the day, heavy or unsuitable food, so far from recruiting their 
enfeebled powers, prostrates their energies more completely, 
and acts in every way injuriously upon the system ; and it is 
no exaggeration to add, that many a valuable life has been 
shortened by disregard of this fact, or by the impossibility of 
obtaining such diet as nature imperatively required. It may 
be urged, that I speak of rare and extreme cases ; but indeed 
it is not so; and the impression produced on me by the 
discomfort and the suffering which have fallen under my own 
observation, has rendered me extremely anxious to aid in 
discovering an efficient remedy for them. With this object 
always in view, I have zealously endeavoured to ascertain, and 
to place clearly before^ my readers, the most rational and 
healthful methods of preparing those simple and essential 
kinds of nourishment which form the staple of our common 
daily fare; and have occupied myself but little with the 
elegant superfluities or luxurious novelties with which I might 
perhaps more attractively, though not more usefully, have 



7EEFACE. IZ 

filled my pages. Should some persons feel disappointed at 
the plan I have pursued, and regret the omissions which thej 
may discover, I would remind them, that the fashionahle 
dishes of the day may at all times be procured from an able 
confectioner ; and that part of the space which I might have 
allotted to them is, I hope and beHeye, better occupied by 
&e subjects, homely as they are, to which I have devoted it — 
that is to say, to ample directions for dressing vegetables, 
and for making what cannot be purchased in this country — 
unadulterated bread of the most undeniably wholesome 
quality; and those refreshing and finely-flavoured varieties 
of preserved firuit which are so conducive to health when 
judiciously taken, and for which in illness there is often such 
a viun and feverish craving when no household stores of them 
can be commanded.* 

Merely to please the eye by such fanciful and elaborate 
decorations as distinguish many modem dinners, or to flatter 
flie palate by the production of new and enticing dainties, 
ought not to be the principal aim, at least, of any work on 
cookery. " Eat, — to live *' should be the motto, by the spirit 
of which aU writers upon it should be guided. 

I must here obtrude a few words of personal interest to 
myself. At the risk of appearing extremely egotistic, I have 
appended " Author's Beeeipt " and " Autkor*$ Original Receipt '* 
to many of the contents of the following pages ; but I have done 
it solely in self-defence, in consequence of the unscrupulous 
manner in which large portions of my volume have been appro- 
priated by contemporary authors, without the slightest acknow- 
ledgment of the source from which they have been derived. 
I have allowed this unfairness, and much beside, to pass 
entirely unnoticed until now; but I am suflering at present 
too severe a penalty for the over-exertion entailed on me by 
the plan which I adopted for the work, longer to see with per- 
fect composure strangers coolly taking the credit and the profits 

* Many of those made up for tale are absolutely dangerous eating ; those 
which are not adulterated are generally so oyersweetened as to be distasteful to 
ioTalids. 



X PREFACE. 

of my toil. The subjoined passage from the preface of my 
first edition will explain in what this toil — so completely at 
variance with all the previous habits of my life, and, therefore, 
so injurious in its effects — consisted; and prevent the ne- 
cessity of recapitulating here, in another form, what I have 
already stated in it *' Amongst the large number of works 
on cookery which we have carefully perused, we have never 
yet met with one which appeared to us either quite intended 
for, or entirely suited to the need of the totally inexperienced ! 
none, in fact, which contained the first rudiments of the art, 
with directions so practical, clear, and simple, as to be at once 
understood, and easily followed, by those who had no previous 
knowledge of the subject This deficiency, we have en- 
deavoured in the present volume to supply, by such thoroughly 
explicit and minute instructions as may, we trust be readily 
comprehended and carried out by any class of learners ; our 
receipts, moreover, with a few trifling exceptions which are 
scrupulously specified, are confined to such as may be perfectly 
depended on, from having been proved beneath our own roof 
and under our own personal inspection. We have trusted 
nothing to others ; but having desired sincerely to render the 
work one of general usefulness, we have spared neither cost 
nor labour to make it so, as the very plan on which it has 
been written must of itself, we think, evidently prove. It 
contains some novel features, calculated, we hope, not only to 
facilitate the labours of the kitchen, but to be of service 
likewise to those by whom they are directed. The principal 
of these is the summary appended to the receipts, of the 
different ingredients which they contain, with the exact 
proportion of each, and the precise time required to dress the 
whole. This shows at a glance what articles have to be 
prepared beforehand, and the hour at which they must be 
ready; while it affords great facility as well, for an estimate of 
the expense attending them. The additional space occupied 
by this closeness of detail has necessarily prevented tlie 
admission of so great a variety of receipts as the book 
might otherwise have comprised ; but a limited number, thus 



PREFACE. XI 

completely explained, may perhaps be more acceptable to the 
reader than a larger mass of materials vaguely given. 

" Onr directions for boning poultry, game, &c., are also, we 
venture to say, entirely new, no author that is known to us 
having hitherto afiforded the slightest information on the sub- 
ject ; but while we have done our utmost to simplify and to 
render intelligible this, and several other processes not 
generally well understood by ordinary cooks, our first and 
best attention has been bestowed on those articles of food of 
which the consumption is the most general, and which are 
therefore of the greatest consequence ; and on what are usually 
termed plain English dishes. With these we have inter- 
mingled many others which we know to be excellent of their 
kind, and which now so far belong to our national cookery, 
as to be met with commonly at all refined modem tables.** 

Since this extract was written, a rather formidable array of 
works on the same subject has issued firom the press, part of 
them firom the pens of celebrated professional gastronomers ; 
others are constantly appearing; yet we make, nevertheless, 
but slight perceptible progress in this branch of our domestic 
economy. Still, in our cottages, as well as in homes of a better 
order, goes on the " waste *' of which I have already spoken. 
It is not, in fact, cookery-books that we need half so much 
as cooks really trained to a knowledge of their duties, and 
suited, by their acquirements, to families of different grades. 
At present, those who thoroughly understand their business 
are so few in number, that they can always command wages 
which place their services beyond the reach of persons of 
moderate fortune. Why should not aU classes participate in 
the benefit to be derived from nourishment calculated to 
sustain healthfiilly the powers of life? And why should the 
English, as a people, remain more ignorant than their conti- 
nental neighbours of so simple a matter as that of preparing 
it for themselves? Without adopting blindly foreign modes 
in anything merely because they are foreign, surely we should 
be wise to learn firom other nations, who excel us in ar^ht 
good or usefiil, all that we can which may tend to remedy 



ZU PREFACB. 

our own defects; and the great firagalitj, combined with 
almost universal culinary skill, or culinary knowledge, at the 
least — ^which prevails amongst many of them — ^is well worthy 
of our imitation. Suggestions of this nature are not, how- 
ever, sufficient for our purpose. Something definite, practical, 
and easy of application, must open the way to our general 
improvement. Efforts in the right direction are already 
being made, I am told, by the establishment of well-conducted 
schools for the early and efficient training of our female 
domestic servants. These will materially assist our progress ; 
and if experienced cooks will put aside the jealous spirit 
of exclusiveness by which they are too often actuated, and 
will impart freely the knowledge they have acquired, they also 
may be infinitely helpful to us, and have a claim upon our 
gratitude which ought to afford them purer satisfaction than 
the sole possession of any eecrets — ^genuine or imaginary — 
connected with their craft. 

The limits of a slight preface do not permit me to pmrsue 
this or any other topic at much length, and I must in conse- 
quence leave my deficiencies to be supplied by some of the 
tlioughtful, and, in every way, more competent writers, who, 
. happily for us, abound at the present day; and make here my 
adieu to the reader.

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERa 



TRUSSING. 



TVnssiiig Needles. 

Coimoir and untnined cooks are often deplorably ignorant of this 
branch of their businew^ a knowledge of which la, nevertheless, quite 
as essential to them as is that of bdling or roasting ; for without it 
they cannot, by any possibility, serve up dinners of decency credit- 
able appearance. We give such brief general directions for it as 
oar space will permit, and as our own observations enable us to 
supply ; but it nas been truly said, by a great authority in these 
matters, that trussing cannot be ^tatighi hy words;*' we would, 
therefore, recommend, that instead of relying on any written 
mstmctions, persons who really desire thoroi^hly to understand the 
subject, and to make themselves acquainted with the mode of entirely 
preparing all varieties of game and poultry more especially for 
table, in the very best manner, should apply for some jaractioal lessons 
to a first-rate poulterer ; or, if this cannot be done, tnat they should 
eodeaTonr to obtain from some weU experienced and skilful oook the 
instruction which they need. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FDR TRUSSING. 

Before a bird is trussed, the skin must be entirely freed frx)m any 
down which may be on it, and from all the stubble-ends of the 
feathers ;* the hair also must be singed from it with lisht^ writing 
paper, care being taken not to smoke nor blacken it in uie operation. 
Directions for cleansing the insides of birds after they are drawn, are 
given in the receipts for dressing them. Chapters XlV. and XV. 

Turkeys, geese, ducks, wild or tame, fowls, and pigeons, should all 
have the necks taken off dose to the bodies, but not the skin of the 
necks, which should be left sufficiently long to turn down upon the 
bocks for a couple of inches or more, where it must be secured, either 
with a needle and coarse soft cotton, or by the pinions of the birds 
when trussed. 

* This sboald be partienlitrfy attended to. 





XAXIV TRUSSING. 

For boiling, all poultry or other birds must have the feet drawn 
off at the first joint of the leg, or as shown in the engraving. (In the 
latter case, the sinews of the joint must be slightly cut, when the bone 
may be easily turned back as here.) The skin 
must then be loosened with the finger entirely from 
^ the le^s, which must be pushed back into the body, 
and the small ends tucked quite imder the apron, 
so as to be entirely out of sight. 

The wings of chickens, fowls, turkeys, and pigeons, are left on 
entire, whether for roasting or boiling. From ^^mmm, 
geese, ducks, pheasants, partridges, black game, ^h")^^ 
moor-fowl, woodcocks, snipes, wld-fowl of all 
kinds, and all small birds, the first two joints are 
taken off, leaving but one joint on, thus:-- 

The feet are left on ducks, and those of tame ones are trussed as 
will be seen at page 278, and upon roast fowls, pheasants, black and 
moor-ffame, piffeons, woodcocks, and snipes. The thick coarse skin 
of the legs of these must be stripped, or rubbed off with a hard cloth 
after they have been held in bodmg water, or over a clear fire for a 
few minutes. The sharp talons must be pulled out, and the nails 
clipped. The toes of the pigeons for roasting should be cut ofi^ 
, Geese, sucking-pigs, hares, and rabbits have the feet taken off at 
the first joint. 

The livers and gizzards are served in the wings of roast turkeys and 
fowls only. 

The heads are still commonly left on pheasants, partridges, and 
black game and moor-game ; but the fashion is declming. Of this 
this we shall speak more particularly in the ensuing chapter. 

Poultry ana birds in general, except perhaps quite the larger 
kinds, are more easily tru^ed into plump handsome form with twme 
and needles proper to the purpose {for which see page 1), than mth 
skewers. The manner in which the legs and wings are confined 
is much the same for all ; the principal difference being in the arrange- 
ment of the former for boiling, which has already been explained. 

There is a present mode of trussing very large fowls for boiling or 
stewing which to our taste is more novel than attractive. The feet 
are left on, and after the skin has been loosened from them in every 
part, the legs are thrust entirely into the bod^ by means of a slight 
mdsion made in the skin just above the first joint on the underside, 
the feet then appear almost as if Rowing out of the sides of the 
breast : the effect of this is not pleasmg. 

TO TRUSS ▲ TURKEY, FOWL, PHRASANT OR PARTRIDOB, FOR 
ROASTINO. 

First draw the skin of the neck down over the back, and secure it 
from slipping up ; then thread a trussing needle of convenient size,* 

* Theto may !)• had, of yarious sisee, at any good Ironmongsr a. 




TBUSSIKO. ZXXV 

Ibr the oo^asion, with packthread or small twine (the former, from 
heing the meet flexible, is best) ; pass it through the pinion of the 
hird, then through the thick part of the thigh, which most be 
brought up close vsuder the toivg^ and in a straight line quite through 
the body, and through the 1^ and pinion on the other side ; draw 
them close, and bring the needle back, passing it through the thick 
part of the leg, and through the second joint of tbe pinion, should it 
be left an the bird ; tie it quite ti^ht ; and then to secnre the 1^^ 
pierce the sidebone and carry the twme over the l^ps, then pass Uie 
needle through the other sidebone, and tie them dose down. If 
skewers be used they should be driven through the pinions and the 
1^8, and a twine passed across the back of the bird, and caught over 
the points of it, and then tied in the centre of the back : this is only 
needful when the trussing is not firm. 

When the head is left on a bird, 
it may still be trussed in the same 
way, and the head brought round, 
as shown here, and kept in place 
by a skewer passed through it, and 
run through the body. When 
_ the bird is trussed entirely with 

Ptartridge. skewers, the point of one is brought 

fiom the other side, throu^^ the pinions and the thighs, and the 
head is fixed upon it. The legs arc then pressed as much as possible 
under the breast, between it and the side-bones, where they are 
lettered a b. The partridge in the engraving is shown with the 
skewen just withdrawn after being roasted. 

Hares, after being filled with forcemeat, and sewn or securely 
fintened up with skewers, are brought into proper roasting form by 
having the head fixed between the snoulders, and either fastened to 
the b^k by means of a long skewer, run through the head quite into 
it, or by passing one through the upper part of the shoulders and 
die neck together, which wUl keep it equally well in place, though 
less thrown back. The fore-legs are then laid strai&;ht along the sides 
of the hare, and a skewer is thrust through them both and the body 
at the same time ; the sinews are just cut through under the hind- 
legs, and they are brought forward as much as possible, and skew- 
ered in the same manner as the others. A stnng is then thrown 
across, under the hare and over the points of botn skewers, being 
crossed before it is passed over the second, and then tied above the 
back. The ears of a hare are left on ; those of a rabbit, which is 
troased in the same way, are taken off. 

Joints of meat require but little arrangement, either for the suit or 
for boiling. A fillet of veal must have the flap, or part to whicn the 
fat adheres, drawn closely round the outside, and be skewered or 
bound firmly into good shape : this vrill apply equally to a round of 
beef The skin or flank of loins of meat must be wrapped over the 
ends of the bones, and skewered orx the underside. iTte cook shouid 




ZXXYl TRUBSINa 

he particularhf carefid to tennrate the JoinU when it has not been dans 
by the butcher, and necks or Teal or mutton also, or much trouble will 
often arise to the carver. 

To flatten and bring cutlets | 
into uniform shape, a bat of 
this form is used : andtoeg^orj 
to cover them with clarified 
butter when they are to be CatietBrt. 

crumbed, a paste-bru^ should be at hand. Indeed, these 
and many other small means and appliances, ought to be 
provided for every cook who is expected to perform her 
duty in a regular and proper manner, for they save much 
time and trouble, and tneir first expense is very slight ; yet 
many kitchens are almost entirely without them. 



7Mt« Brush. To TRUSS FISH. 

Salmon, salmon-]^!, pike, and some few other larjpe fish, are 
occasionally trussed m the form of an S by passing a stnng through 
the head, and tying it securely, then through the centre of the booy, 
and next round the tail, whicn should be turned the reverse way of 
the head, and the whole should then be drawn closely together and 
well fastened. Whitings and other fish of small size are trussed with 
the tails merely skewered into their mouths. 

Obs. — It is indispensable for cooks to know how to carve neatly for 
pies, pudding, fricassees, and curries, at the least, hares, rabbits, rowls, 
and other birds. For those who are quite without experience in this 
branch of their business, the directions and the illustrations in the 
next chapter for carving a fowl into joints, will be found useful ; and 
probably many of the other instructions also.

CARVING. 




FlshCarfen. 



Whether the passing fashion of the day exact it of her or not, 
a gentlewoman would always, for her own sake, be able to carve 
wol and easQj, the dishes which are placed before her, that she may 
be competent tp do the honours of a table at any time with propriety 
and seU-possession.* To gentlemen, and especially to those who 
mix much in society, some knowledge of this art, and a certain 
degree of skill in the exercise of it, are indispensable, if they would 
aroid the chance of appearing often to great disadvantage them- 
selves, and of causing dissatisfaction and annoyance to others; for the 
miGouth operations of bad carvers occasion almost as much discom- 
fort to those who witness, as they do generally of awkwardness and 
embarrassment to those who exhibit them 

The precise mode of carving various dishes must of course depend 
on many contingencies. For a plain family-dinner, or where strict 
economy is an imperative consideration, it must sometimes, of 
necessity, differ from that which is laid down here. We have con- 
fined oar instructions to the fashion usually adopted in the world. 

Carving knives and forks are to be had of many forms and 
sizes, and adapted to different purposes: the former should always 
have a very keen edge, and the latter two prongs only. 



• As this em onlj be aooomplished by pnctioe, young persons should be early 
teenstomed to carre at home, where the failure of their first attempts will cause 
them much less embarrassment than they would in another sphere, and at a 
later period of lifla.

No. I. cod's head and shoulders (and cod fish 

GENERALLY.) 

The thick part of the back of this, as of all large fish— salmon 
excepted — is the firmest and finest eating. It should be carved 
across, rather thick, and, as much as possible, in unbroken slices, 
from a to h. The sound, which is considered a delicacy, lies under- 
neath, and lines the back-bone : it must be reached with a spoon in 
the direction c. The middle of the fish, when served to a family- 
party, may be carved in the same manner, or in any other which 
convenience and economy may dictate. 

No. 2. A TURBOT. 

In carving this most excellent fish, the rich gelatinous skin 
attached to it, and a portion of the thick part of the fins, should be 
served with every slice. If the point or the fish-knife be drawn 
down the centre of the back through to the bone, in the lines ah c^ 
and from thence to d d d, the flesh may easily be raised upon the 
blade in handsome portions, The thickest parts of all flat fish are 
the best. A brill and a John Dory are served exactly like a turbot. 

SOLES. 

The more elegant mode of serving these, and the usual one at 
good tables, is to raise the flesh from the bones as from a turbot, 
which is easily done when the fish are large ; but when they are too 
small well to admit of it, they must be divided across quite through 
the bone : the shoulders, and thick part of the body, are me 
superior portions. 

No. 3. SALMON. 

It is customary to serve a slice of the thick part of the back of 
this fish, which is marked from a to A, with one of the thinner and 
richer portions of it, shown by the line from e to d> It should be 
carved quite straight across, and the fine flakes of the flesh should 
be preserved as entire as possible. Salmon-peel, pike, haddocks, 
large whitings, and all fish which are served curled round, and with 
the backs uppermost, are carved in the same manner ; the flesh is 
separated from the bone in the centre of the back, and taken ofl^, on 
the outer side first, in convenient portions for serving. The flesh of 
mackerel is best raised from the bones by passing the fish-slice from 
the tail to the head : it may then be divided in two. 

No. 4. saddle op mutton. 
The manner of trussing this joint varies almost fjrom season to 



CABTIKG. ZXX1X 

Kamm, the mode which is considered in good taste one year being 
obsolete the next, in families where passing fashions are closely 
observed. It seems really immaterial whether it be served as shown 
in the engraving ; or whether two or three joints of the tail be left 
on and surronnded with a paper frill. This joint is now trussed for 
Toasting in the manner shown in the engraving; and when it is 
dished a silver skewer replaces the one marked e. It is likewise 
often still served in good families with only two or three joints of the 
tail lefl on. The most nsnal mode of carving it is in thin slices cut 
quite along the bone, on either side, in the line a to b; but it is 
sometimes sliced obliquely from c to ^ : this last fashion is rather 
gaining ground. The thick end of the joint must then, of course, be 
to the left of the carver. A saddle of pork or of lamb is carved 
exactly in the same manner 

No. 5. A HAUNCH OP VENISON (OR MUTTON.) 

An incision must first be made entirely across the knuckle end of 
this joint, quite down to the bone, in the line a 5, to let the gravy 
escape ; it must then be carved in thin slices taken as deep as they 
can be, the whole length of the haunch, from c to ^. A portion of 
the fat should invariably be served with the venison. 

No. 6. SIRLOIN OR RUMP OF BEEF. 

As the venr tender part of this favourite joint, which lies under 
the bone, and is called the ^let, is preferred by many eaters, the beef 
should be raised, and some slices be taken from it in the direction 
a b, before the carver proceeds further. The slices should be cut 
quite across the joint, from side to side, as indicated by the line from 
e to d^ in which direction the whole of the meat is occasionally 
earved, though it is much more usual to slice the upper part from 
e to /I When the brown outside has been taken off this, it should 
be evenly carved in thin slices, and served with some of the gravy in 
the dish, and accompanied with horse-radish very lightly and finely 
aeraped, with tofts of which the beef is commonly garnished. 

RIBS OP BEEF 

Are carved in the same manner as the sirloin ; but there is no fillet 
attached to them. 

A ROUND OP BEEP. 

To carve this well, a very sharp-edged and thin-bladed knife is 
lequisite. A thick slice should first be taken entirely off the top of 
She joint, leaving it very smooth ; it should then be cut as thin and 



Xi CABVINO. 

as evenly as possible, and delicate slioes of the fat or odder should be 
served with the lean 

A BRISKET OF BEEF 

Is carved in slices quite across the bones. 

No. 7. LEO OF MUTTON, 

This, whether roast or boiled, is dished as it lies in the en^ving, 
unless when fanciful eaters prefer the underside of the joint laid 
uppermost, and carved quite across the middle, for the sake of the 
finely grained meat which lies beneath the part commonly called the 
Pope*s eye. In a general way, the mutton should be sliced, rather 
thick than thin as directed by the line between a & { the fat will be 
found in the direction c d. 

No. 8. QUARTER OF LAMB. 

The shoulder must be divided, and raised entirely fVom the breast 
in the direction of the letters abed, A slice of butter sprinkled 
with cayenne and salt is then usually laid between them, and a little 
lemon-juice is added, or a cold Maitre d* Hotel sauce is substituted for 
these. The shoulder may then be removed into another dish or 
not, as is most convenient. The brisket is next separated from the 
long bones in the line e/, and carved in the direction g h ; the rib- 
bones are divided from t % toj ;'. The choice of the different parts 
is offered in serving them. 

No. 9. SHOULDER OP MUTTON OR LAMB. 

Commence by cutting from the outer edge direct to the bone of 
the shoulder in the line a 6, and carve as many slices from that part 
of the joint as it will afford : then, if more be required, draw the 
knife on either side of the ridge of the blade-bone in the direction 
c c dd. The fat must be carved in the line « /. Some eaters have 
a preference for the juicy, but not very finely-grained flesh on the 
under-side of the shoulder, which must be turned, for it to be carved. 
For the mode of boning a shoulder of mutton or veal, and giving it 
a more agreeable appearance, see 219. 

No. 10. A SUCKING PIQ. 

Every part of a sucking pig is good, but some persons consider the 
flesh of the neck which lies between the shoulders, and the ribs as 
the most delicate portion of it. The shoulders themselves are pre- 
ferred by others. They should be taken off, and the legs also, by 
passing the knife under them at the lettes ab c. The ribs may then 



CABYIKCk Zli 

be easilj diyided from e to d. The flesh only of the larger joints 
should be served to ladies ; but gentlemen often prefer it sent to 
them on the bones. 

A FILLET OP TEAL. 

There is no difference between the mode of caryiB|^ this and a round 
of beef ; but the brown outside slice of the Teal is much liked b^ 
many eaters, and aportion of it should be served to them when it is 
known to be so. The forcemeat must be reached by cutting deeply 
into the flap, and a slice of it served always with the veaL 

A LOIN OF VEAL. 

This may be carved at choice quite across through the thick part 
of the flesh, or in slices taken in the direction of the bones. A slice 
of the kidney, and of the fat which surrounds it, should accompany 
the veaL 

No. 11. A BREAST OF VEAL. 

The brisket or gristles* of this joint must first be entirely separated 
from the rib-bones by pressing the knife quite through it in the line 
between a and b ; this part may then be divided as shown by the 
letters c ccddd^ and the long bones or ribs may easily be separated 
in the direction ef. The taste of those who are served should be 
consulted as to the part of the joint which is preferred. The sweet- 
bread is commonly sent to table with a roast breast of veal, and laid 
upon it : a portion of it should be served with every plate of the 
breasL 

No. 12. A TONGUE. 

This is sliced, not very thin, through the thickest and best part, 
shown by the letters a b. The fat of the root, when it is liked, must 
be carved by turning the tongue, and cutting in the direction c d. 

No. 13. A calf's head. 

« 
An entire calfs head, served in its natural form, recalls too forcibly 

^ The tmdoHB are literallj the small white gristles themaelyes, which arefonnd 
imder the flesh in this part of the joint When freed from the bone attached to 
them, they may he dressed in a yariety of ways, and are extremely good : but they 
Koaixe from, toax to siz hoars* stewing to render them perfectly tender, eyen 
when each tendon is divided into three or fonr slices. The upper flesh mnst be 
laid back from the tendons before they are taken from the breast, not left ad- 
hering to them. They are yery good simply stewed in white gravy, and served 
with green peas, a la Franpaiu, in the centre. The breast entirely boned, forced, 
and zoUed, makes a handsome dish* either roasted or stewed. 




Zlii GABTING. 

the appearance of the living animal to which it has helonged not to 
be very uninviting. Even when the half of one only is sent to tables 
something of the same aspect remains, and as it is in every way im« 
proved, and rendered most easy to carve when boned * and rolled, we 
wculd recommend its being so prepared whenever it can be done 
without difficulty. Our engraving does 
'^ ^ ^ ^^"1^ "*'* ^^® ^ ^^"^ flattering representation of 
I ^ fj9 *' "^ *^*' form, but having been dressed 
^ with the skin on, it was not quite so easily 
brought into handsome shape as if it had 
been freed from it ; yet we would nevertheless advise its being gene- 
rally retained. When the head is served without being boned, it is 
carved across the cheek, in the line from atob; the part which in 
flavour and appearance resembles a sweetbread, and which is regarded 
as a delicacy, lies in the direction indicated by the letters c d. The 
flesh of the eye is another favourite morsel, which mu^t be detached 
from the head by passing the point of the carving knife deeply round 
the eye-hole, in the circle marked e e. 

No. 14. A HAM. 

Strict economists sometimes commence the carving of a ham at the 
knuckle, and so graduallv reach the choicer portion of it ; but this 
method is not at all to oe recommended. It should be cut at once 
through the thick part of the flesh, quite down to the bone, in the 
line a 6, and sliced very thin and evenly, without separating the fat 
from the lean. The decoration of the ham No. 14, is formed by 
leaving on it a portion of the rind at the knuckle in a semi-circle, 
and then trimming it into scollops or points at pleasure ; and the 
ornamental part of the top is formed from the fat which is pared 
away from the thick end and the edges. A paper ruffle, as wiU. be 
seen, is wrapped round the bone of the knuckle. 

No. 15. A PHEASANT. 

This bird was formerly alwajrs sent to table with the head on, but 

* This vill be more easily accomplished by an experienced cook after the head 
has been boiled for half an hoar and then allowed to cool ; bat it should not be 
left ojitil cold before it is altogether prepared for dressing. After the bones are 
removed, it should be laid on a clean cloth, and the inside sprinkled over or 
rubbed -wiih. a little salt, mace, and cayenne, weU mixed together ; the tongas 
may be laid upon, and rolled up in it. It must be secured, first with a skewer, 
and then bound tightly round with tape. It should be boiled or stewed extremely 
tender; and is excellent when just covered with good stock, and simmered for 
two hours, or when strong broth is substituted for this, and the bones are added 
to it. The head may be glazed, and served with rich brown gravy, or with the 
ordinary sauces if preferred ; and it may be eaten cold, with Oxford brawn sauce, 
wkich is compounded of brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, and salt, mixed to the 
ta*te, with the addition of oil when it is liked.

ft ma a barbarous castoin, wbicb bas been partially abandoned of late 
in the best bonsea, and wbicb it is boped may soon be altogether 
superseded by one of better taste. The breast is by far the finest 
part of a pheasant, and it is carved in slices from pinion to pinion, in 
the lines aab b; the legs may then be taken off, m the direction c d. 
The bird, when it is pre^rred so, may be entirely dismembered by the 
directions for a fowl. No. 16. Black and moor-game are trussed and 
served like pheasants. The breasts of both are very fine eating, and 
the thigh ot the black-cock is highly esteemed. 

No. 16. ▲ BOILED FOWL. 

The boQed fowl of plate 6 is represented as garnished with branches 
of parsley, which is an error, as tney would ht appropriate to it only 
if it were cold, and it is seldom served so, being considered insipid. 
Small tufts of cauliflower would have been in better keeping with it, 
as the bird is supposed to be dished for the dinner-table. Unless it 
be for large family parties, fowls are seldom carved there entirely 
into joints ; but when it is wished to divide them so, the fork should 
be fixed firmly in the centre of the breast, and the leg, beinj^ first 
disengaged from the skin, may be taken off with the wing m the 
Ime ah\ or, the wing being previously removed, by carving it down 
the line to &, and there separating it from the neck-bone, the leg may 
be released from the skin, and easily taken off, by cutting round it 
from a to c, and then turning it with the fork, back fh>m the body, 
when the joint will readily be perceived. 

Afler the leg and wing on the other side have been taken off in 
the same manner, the merrythought must follow. To 
remove this, the knife must be drawn through the flesh / 
in the line d e, and then turned towards the neck quite 
under the merrythought, which it will so lift from the 
breast, in this form : — The neck-bones — which lie close 
under tbe upper tArt of the wings, and are shaped thus 
—must next be aisengaged from the fowl, by putting 
the knife in at the top of the joint, dividing the long 
part of tbe bone from the flesh, and 
bieakinff the short one off by raising it 
up, ana turning it from the body; the 
breast, which is shown here, may then 
be divided from it by merely cutting i 
through the tender ribs on either ' 
side. 

It is seldom that fiirther disjointing than this is required at table ; 
but when it is necessary to cut up the entire fowl, the remainder of il 
must be laid with the back uppermost, and 
to take off the side-bones, which are of this 
shape— the point of the knife must be I 
pressed through the back-bone, near tha 






Xliv OABYIKCk 

top, about half an inch from the centre, and brought down towards 
the end of the back, quite through the bone, then turned in the 
opposite direction, when the joints will separate without difficulty. 
All which then remains to be done is, to lay the edge of the knife 
across the middle of the only two undivided bones, and then with 
the fork to raise the small end of the fowl, which will part them 
immediately : to carve a boiled fowl or chicken in a more modem 
manner, see the directions which follow. The breast, wings, and 
merrythought, are the most delicate parts of a fowl. On the upper 
part of the side-bone is the small round portion of flesh called the 
oyster J by many persons considered as a great delicacy. 

No. 17. A ROAST FOWL. 

It is not usual to carve fowls entirely at table in the manner 
described above. The wings, and any other joints are taken off only 
as they are required. The breast of a very large fowl may be carved 
in slices like tnat of a turkey ; or the whole of that of a small one 
may be taken off with the wings, as shown by the line ab. As the 
liver is a delicacy, the handsomer mode of serving these last is to 
remove the gizzard, which is seldom eaten, then to divide the liver, 
and to send an equal portion of it with each wing. The whole of a 
roast fowl may be carved by the directions we have alrea/ly given for 
No. 16. 

No. 18. A PARTRIDGE. 

When partridges are served to ladies only, or in parties where 
(hey are present, it is now customary to take off the heads, to truss 
the legs snort, and to make them appear (in poulterer's phrase) aU 
breast. For gentlemen's dinners, the heads may be left on or not at 
choice. The most ready mode of carving a partri^e is to press back 
the legs, then to fix the fork firmly in the inside of the back, and by 
passing the blade of the knife flat under the lower part of the breast, 
to raise it, with the wings, entire from the body, from which it easily 
separates. The breast may then be divided in the middle, as shown 
bv the line from a to 6 in the engraving here. 
This is by far the best and handsomest manner ^ 
of carving a partridge, but when the supply ot 
game at table is small, and it is necessary to 
serve three persons from the choicer parts of 
one bird, a not very large wing should be taken off with the leg on 
either side, in the line from a to & in No. 13, and sufficient of the 
breast will still remain to send to a third eater. The high game- 
flavour of the back of a partridge, as well as that of various other 
birds,* is greatly relished by many persons. 

• A great man of the north eloquently deioribes that of a grouse as " the noat 
pungmttpalai^purnng,wild biittr-twmt*" 





CARVINO. Xl? 



No. 19. A WOODCOCK. 

The thigh and back are the most esteemed parts of a woodcocki 
which, being a small bird, may be carred entirely through the centre 
of the breast and back> or distributed in the same manner as the 
partridge for three, which we have described ; or even carred down 
like a fowl, if needfuL In whatever way it is divided, however, 9 
portion of the toast which has received the trail, and on which it 
should always be sent to table, must invariably be served to all who 
partake of it. The very old &shion of trussing the bird with its own 
bill, by running it through the thighs and body, is again adopted 
by very good cooks of the present day ; but 
the common method of preparing either wood- > 
eocks or snipes for table is this : the trussing ^ 
of the legs is, however, better shown at 
2^08. 19 and 21 of Plate 6 

No. 20. ▲ PIOBON. 

The breast and wings of a mgeon may be raised in the same way 
as those of a partrid^ (see ao. 18) ; or the bird may be carved 
entirely through in the line a 5. For the second course, pigeons 
should be dished upon young delicate water-cresses 

No. 21. A SMIPB. 

This bird is trussed, roasted, and served exactly like a woodcock. 
It is not of a size to require any carving, beyond dividing in two, if 
atalL 

No. 22. A G008E. 

The ddn below the breast, called the apron, must first be cut off in 
a circular direction as indicated by the letters aaoy when a glass of 
port-wine or of daret, ready mixed with a teaspoonAil of mustard, 
may be poured into the body or not, at choice. Some of the stuffing 
should tnen be drawn out with a spoon, and the neck of the goos«, 
which ought to be to the right and not to the left hand, as here, 
bdiu^ tamed a little towards the carver, the flesh of the breast should 
be sliced in the lines from bb b to c cc, on either side of the bone 
The wings may then be taken off like those of any other bird, and 
tiien the legs, which, in the engraving No. 22, are trussed so com- 
pletely under the apron ss to render their outline scarcely dis- 
tinguishable. Graoeiul and well-skilled carvers never turn birds on 
theur sides to remove any of the joints, but those of a goose, unless it 
be very youn^, are sometimes severed from it with difficulty ; and 
the common directions for assistins the process in that case are, to 
turn it on its side, and with the foric to press down the small end of 



Xlvi CAKVINQ, 

the le^; then to pass the knife quite under it from the top down to 
the jomt^ when the leg should be turned back from the bird with the 
fork, while the thigh-bone is loosened from its socket with the knife. 
The end of the pinion marked d is then held down in the same 
manner, to faciHtate the separation of the bones at e, from which 
point the knife is drawn under the wing, which it takes off. The 
merrythought of a goose is small, and, to remove it the knife must 
first be turned a little from the neck, after the flesh has been cut 
through, and then passed under it, back to^vards the neck. For the 
remainder of the carving, the directions for that of a fowl will 
suffice 

DUCKS. 

Tame ducks are served with the feet (which are liked by many 
people) left upon them and trussed up over the backs. If lar^ they 
may be carved like a goose, but when very young may be disjointed 
like chickens ; the only material difference between them being the 
position of the thigh -joints, which lie much farther towards the 
KMck-bone than those of a fowL 

No. 23. A WILD DUCK. 

The breasts of wild-fowl are the only parts of them held in much 
estimation, and these are carved in slices from the legs to the neck. 
The legs and pinions may, if required, be taken off exactly like those 
of a pheasant. 

No. 24. A. TUnKET. 

The carving of a turkey commences by taking slices off the breast, 
from the letters b b quite through the forcemeat, which lies under 
the letter a, to c c : the greater part of the flesh of the wings is thus 
taken off likewise. When the bird is boned and filled with sausage 
or other forcemeat, the breast is carved entirely across in the direc- 
tion d e, nearly, or quite down to the back, which it is better not 
altogether to divide at first, as the appearance of the turkey is not 
then so good. When it has been prepared in the ordinary manner, 
after the breast has been disposed of, the pinions and the legs may be 
taken off, the first in the line from /to g, and the latter by passing 
the knife under it at A, and bringing it down to the joint at t j, where 
it must be taken off in the line shown. The whole of the joints 
being in form exactly like those of a fowl, may be separated in the 
same manner. The gizzard is more commonly eaten broiled after 
having been scored, and very highly seasoned with cayenne and with 
a sufficiency of salt, than in any other way. A slice or portion of 
the liver should be served with the white fleph of Uie tur&ey as &r 
as ponible. 



CABYXKa Xlvu 



Xo. 25. A HARE. 

A hare should he placed with its head to the left of the canrer, 
therefore the engraving No. 25 shows it turned in the wrong direc« 
tion. It is so yery great an improvement to take out the hack-hone 
before a hare is roasted, that we would recommend it to be done 
wherever it can be so without difficulty : it may then be carved in 
the line a b quite through, or only partially so at choice. When the 
bone remains in, slices may be taken down the whole length of the 
hack from cc to dd; the legs, which, next to the back, are con* 
aidered the best eating, may then be taken off in the direction ef, 
and the flesh divided from or served upon them, after the small 
bones have been parted firom the thighs. The shoulders, which are 
not generally much esteemed, though sometimes liked by sportsmen, 
may next be taken off by passing the knife at the letters g h between 
the joint and the body. When a hare is young, the back is some- 
times divided at the joints into three or four parts, after being freed 
iiom the ribs and under-skin. 

No. 27. A FRIOANDEAU OP YBAI*. 

This is usually stewed, or rather braised sufficiently tender to be 
divided with a spoon, and requires no carving; but the fat (or undcr- 
part of the fillet) attached to it, marked aaa, which is sometimes, 
but not invariably served with it now, may be carved in even slices. 
The larding differs somewhat from that which we have described, but 
the mode Siown here allows the fricandeau to be glazed with more 
facility 

The engraving of the entrie No. 26 is intended merely to show the 
manner of dishing the cutlets. They may be of mutton, lamb, veal, 
or pork ; and the centre may be filled with the sauce or stewed 
vegetable appropriate to either; as sovbiscy marbB of asparagus, of 
mushrooms, or of tomatas; or green peas a la Frangaise, stewed 
cucumbers, or aught else that is suited to the kind of meat wliich is 
lerved.

people, bas hitherto been rery mncb neglected in England ; * yet it 
really presents no difficulties which a little practice, and the most 
common degree of care, will not readily overcome ; and we strongly 
recommend increased attention to it, not only on account of the ^ss 
and inconvenience which ignorance of it occasions in many house- 
holds, but because a better knowledge of it will lead naturally to 
improvement in other branches of cookery connected with il in 
which our want of skill is now equally apparent. 

We have endeavoured to show by the list at the beginning of this 
chapter the immense number of dinerent articles of which soup may 
be in turn compounded. It is almost superfluous to add, that it may 
be rendered at pleasure exceedingly rich, or simple in the extreme ; 
composed, in fact, of all that is most choice in diet, or of little beyond 
herbs and vegetables. 

From the varied produce of a well-stored kitchen garden, it may be 
made excellent at a very trifling cost ; and where fish is fresh and 
abundant it may be cheaply supplied nearly equal in quality to that 
for which a full proportion of meat is commonly used. 

It is beat suited to the colder seasons of the year when thickened 
weU with rice, semoulina, pearl barley, or other ingredients of the 
same nature ; and adapted to the summer months when lighter and 
more refreshing. Families who have resided mui^h abroad, and those 
accustomed to continental modes of service, prefer it usually in any 
form to the more solid and heavy dishes which still oflen supersede 
it altogether at our tablesf (except at those of the more affluent 
classes of society, where it appears, as a matter of course, in the daily 
bills of fare), and which are so oppresnve^ not only to foreigners, but 
to all persons generally to whom circumstances have rendered them 
unaccustomed diet; and many a housekeeper who is compelled by a 
narrow income to adopt a system of rigid domestic economy, would 
find it assist greatly in furnishing comtbrtable meals in a very frugal 
manner, if the proper modes of making it were fully comprehended 
as they ought to be4

and let the inside of theeover and the rim be eqnaUy to. Waah 
the meat, and prepare the yegetables with great nicety before 
they are hiid into it ; and be careful to keep it always closely shut 
when it is on the fire. Never, on any account, set the soup by in it, 
but strain it off at once into a clean pan, and fill the stock-pot imme- 
diately with water; pursue the same plan with all stewpans and 
aucepans directly they are emptied. 

Skim the soup thoroughly when it first begins to boil, or it will 
not be easy afterwards to render it clear ; throw in some salt, which 
will a^ist to bring the scum to the surface, and when it has all been 
taken off, add the herbs and veffetables ; for if not long stewed in the 
soup, their flavour will prevail too strongly. Remember that the 
trimmings, and the hom» of fresh meat, the necks of poultry, the 
liquor in which a joint has been boiled, and the shank- bones of 
mutton, are all excellent additions to the stock-pot, and should be 
carefully reserved for it. The remains of roast poultry and game 
also will improve both the colour and the flavour of broth or soup. 

Let the soup be very slowly heated, and after it has been well 
skimmed, and has boiled for a few minutes, draw it to the side of 
the stove and keep it tmmeri-iie tofUyy but without ceasing, until 
it is done ; for on this, as will nereafter be shown, its excellence 
principally depends. Every good cook understands perfectly the 
difference produced by the fast boiling, or the gende stewing^ of soups 
and gravies, and will adhere strictly to the latter method.* 

Pour boiling water, in small quantities at first, to the meat and 
vegetables of which the soup is to be made when they have been 
liKd or browned ; but otherwise, always add coid water to the meat. 

Unless precise orders to the contrary have been given, onions, 
eschalots, and garlic, should be used for seasoning with great mode- 
ration ; for not only are they very offensive to many eaters, but to 
persons of delicate habit their effects are sometimes extremely preju- 
dicial ; and it is only in coarse cookery that their flavour is allowed 
ever strongly to prevaiL 

A small proportion of siu;ar, about an ounce to the gallon, will 
very much improve the &vour of gravy-stock, and of all rich 
brown soups; it may be added also to some othera with advantage ; 
and for this, directions will be given in the proper places. 

Two ounces of salt may be allowed for each gallon of soup or 
broth, in which large quantities of vegetables are stewed; but an 
ounce and a half will be sufficient for such as contain few or none ; it 
u always easy to add more if needful, but oversalting in the fiirst

instance is a fault for which there is no remedy but that of increas- 
ing the proportions of all the other ingredients, and stewing the 
whole afresh, which occasions needless trouble and expense, even 
when time will admit of its being done. 

As no particle of fat should be seen floating on soup when sent to 
table, it is desirable that the stock should l^ made the day before 
it is wanted, that it may become quite cold ; when the fat may be 
entirely cleared off without difficulty. 

When cayenne pepper is not mixed with rice-flour, or with any 
other thickening, grind it down with the back of a spoon, and stir a 
little li(}uid to it &fore it is thrown into the stevrpan, as it is apt to 
remain in lumps, and to occasion great irritation of the throat when 
swallowed so. 

Serve, not only soups and sauces, but all other dishes, as hot as 
possible, 

THE TIME REQUIRED FOR BOILINQ DOWN SOUP OB STOCK. 

This must be regulated by several considerations ; for though the 
mere juices of meat require but little boiling after they have been 
fully extracted by the slow heating recommended by Baron Liebeg, 
soup to which many vegetables are added (winter vegetables espe- 
cially) requires long stewing to soften and to blend properly the 
flavour of all the ingredients which it contains, as that of no one in 
particular ought to be allowed to predominate over the rest. We 
nave in consequence retained the old directions as to time, in many of 
the following receipts ; but an intelligent cook will soon ascertain 
from practice and observation how and when to vary it with ad- 
vantage. Over^boUing renders all i)reparations insipid, and causes 
undue reduction of them likewise; it is a fault, therefore, which 
should be carefolly avoided. 

TO THICKEN SOUPS. 

Except for white soups, to which arrow-root is, we think, more 
appropriate, we prefer, to all other ingredients generally used for 
this purpose, the finest and freshest rice -flour, which, after being" 
passed Uirough a lawn sieve, should be thoroughly blended with 
the salt, pounded spices, catsup, or wine, required to finish the 
flavouring of the soup. Sufficient liquid should be added to it very 
gradually to render it of the consistence of batter, and it should also 
be perfectly smooth ; to keep it so, it should be moistened sparingly 
at first, and beaten with the back of a spoon until every lump has 
disappeared. The soup should boil quickly when the thickening is 
stirred into it, and be simmered for ten mmutes afterwards. From 
an ounce and a half to two ounces of rice-flour will thicken suf- 
ficiently a quart of soup. 

Instead of this, arrow-root or the condiment known by the name 
of tous les mois, which greatly resembles it, or potato flour, or the 
French thickening called roux (see Chapter V.), may be used in the 



CHAP. 1.] SOUPS. 5 

following proportions : — Two and a half ounces of either of the first 
three, to four pints and a half of soup ; to be mixed fpraduaUy with 
a little cold stock or water, stirred into the boiling soup, and sim- 
mered for a minute. 

Six ounces of flour with seven of butter, made into a roux^ or 
njerely mixed together with a large knife, will be required to thicken 
a tureen of soup ; as much as half a pound is sometimes used ; 
these must be added by degrees, and carefully stirred round in 
the soup until smoothly blended with it, or they will remain in 
lumps. We would, however, recommend any other thickening rather 
than this unwholesome mixture. 

All the ingredients used for soups should be fresh, and of good 
quality, particularly Italian pastes of every kind (macaroni, vermi- 
celli, &c.}, as they contract, by long keeping, a peculiarly unpleasant, 
musty flavour. 

Onions, freed irom the outer skin, dried gradually to a deep 
brown, in a slow oven, and flattened like Norfolk biffins, will keep 
for almost any length of time, and are extremely useful for height- 
ening the colour and flavour of broths and gravies.* 

TO PRY BREAD TO SERVE WITH SOUP. 

Cut some slices a quarter of an inch thick from a stale loaf; pare 
off the crust and divide the bread into dice, or cut it with a small 
paste-cutter into any other form. For half a pound of bread put 
two ounces of the b^ butter into a frying-pan, and when it is quite 
melted, add the bread ; keep it turned over a gentle fire until it is 
equally coloured to a veiy pale brown, then drain it from the butter, 
and dry it on a soft cloth, or on a sheet of paper placed before a 
dear fire upon a dish, or upon a sieve reversed. 

SIPPETS X LA REINE. 

Having cut the bread as for common sippets, spread it on a dish, 
and pour over it a few spoonsful of thin cream, or of good milk : let 
it soak for an hour, then fry it in fresh butter of a delicate brown, 
drain and serve the sippets very hot. 

TO MAKE NOUILLES. 

{An elegant substitute for Vermicelli.') 

"Wet with the yolks of four eggs, as much fine dry sifted flour as 
will make them into a firm but very smooth paste. Koll it out as 
thin as possible, and cut it into bands of about an inch and a quarter 
in width. Dust them lightly with flour, and place four of them one 
upon the other. Cut them obliquelv into the finest possible strips ;

gradually into the boiling soup, and in ten minutes the^ will be done. 
Various other forms may be given to this paste at wilL It may be 
divided into a sort of ribbon macaroni ; or stamped with small con«

delicate departments of cookery, and when cut as for soup, and pre- 
pared as for the OenoUes a la Heine of Chapter XV IIL makes very 
superior puddings, pastry, fritters, and other sweet dishes. 

TEOETABLE VERMICELLI. 

(Vegetables cut very fine for soups.) 

Cut the carrots into inch lengths, then pare them round and round ia 
ribands of equal thickness, tiu the inside is reached ; next cut these 
ribands into straws, or very small strips; celery is prepared in the same 
way, and turnips also are first pared into ribands, then sliced into strips ; 
these last require less boilins than the carrots, and attention must be 
paid to this, for if broken, the whole would have a bad appearance in 
soup. The Slier plan is to boil each vegetable separatelyf till tole- 
rably tender, in a uttle pale broth (in water if this be not at hand), 
to drain them well, and put them into the soup, which should be clear, 
only a few minutes before it is dished. For cutting them small, in 
other forms, the proper instruments will be found at the iron- 
monger's. 

EXTRACT OF BEEF ;

(Baron L%eheg*s Receipt) 

Obsbbyatiok. — This admirable preparation is not only most valu- 
able as a restorative of the best kind for invalids who require light but 
highly nutritious diet, it is also of the utmost utility for the general 
purposes of the kitchen, and will enable a cook who can take skilful 
advantage of it, to convert the cold meat which often abounds so in- 
conveniently in an English larder, from our habit of having ioints of 
large size so much served, into good nourishing dishes, wnich the 
hasnes and minces of our common cookery are not, though they may 
answer well enough as mere varieties of aiet. We shall indicate in 
the proper chapters the many other uses to which this beef juice— for 
such indeed it is— will be found eminently adapted. Of its value in 
illness it is impossible to speak too highly ; and m evexy family, there- 
fore, the exact mode of making it ought to be thoroughly understood. 
The economist who may consider it expensive, must remember that 
drugs and medical advice are usually far more so ; and in cases of ex- 
treme debility the benefit derived from it, when it is well prepared 
and judiciously administered, is often remarkable. It should be given 
in small quantities at first, and in its pure state. It may afterwards be 
varied by the addition of vermicelli, semoulina, or other preparatioos

of the kind ; and also by nsing for it a portion of mntton, calTs head, 
ponltzy, or game, when these suit a patient as well as the beef. 

HxcBiPT. — ^Take a pound of good, juicj beef (rumpst^ik is best for 
the pnrpose), fVom wnich all the skm and fat that can possibly be 
separated from it, has been cut away. Chop it up small like sausage- 
meat ;^ then mix it thoroughly with an exact pint of cold water, and 
place it on the side of the stove to heat very uowly indeed; and give 
It an oocaaional stir. It may stand two or three hours before it is 
allowed to simmer, and will then require at the utmost but fifteen 
minutes of gentle boiling. Professor Liebeg directs even less time 
than this, but the soup then occasionally retuns a raw flavour which 
it distasteful. Salt should be added when the boiling first commencesi 
and for invalids, this, in general, is the only seasoning required. 
When the extract is thus far prepared, it may be pour^ from the 
meat into a basin, and allowed to stand until any particles of fat it 
may exhibit on the surface can be skimmed off entirely, and the sedi- 
ment has subsided and left the soup quite clear (which it speedily 
becomes), when it may be poured gentiy off, heated in a clean sauce- 
pan, and served at once. It will contain all the nutriment which the 
meat wUl yield. The scum should always be well cleared from the 
snrfaoe of the soup as it accumulates. 

To make light beef tea or broth, merely increase the proportion of 
water to a pint and a half or a quart ; but in all else proceed as above.

0b9, — To mingle vegetable diet in its best form with this extract, it 
will be sufficient, as we have explained in ^* Cookery for Invalids,** to 
boil down the kind of v^^table desired, sliced or cut up small, in a 
Tery moderate quantity of water, until its juices are well drawn out ; 
then to strain off the liquid from it with slight pressure, and, when 
it has become cold, to pour it to the choppy meat instead of water. 
Several different sorts can be mixed together, and cooked in this way: 
the water must boil before they are added to it. 

They should be much more tender than when merely boiled for 
table, but not reduced to pulp. The juice should remam clear ; no 
salt riiould be added ; and it should be quite cold before it is stirred 
to the meat 

AVhen the extract is wanted for gravy, a small portion of onion, 
and of herbs, carrots, celery, and the other usual vegetables, may be 
stewed together, to give it tiie requisite flavour. 

About an inch square of the Jewish beef Tsee Chapter of Fobbigk 
Cookxbt), whether cooked or uncooked, will impart a fine savour to 
it ; the smoked surface of this should be pared off before it is used, 
and it may be added in thin slices. 




8 KODEBK COOKEBT. [cb>p. i. 

BOlTILLOl?. 

(TJie Common Soup or Beef 'Broth of France; cheap, and very whiles 

some.) 
This soup, or broth as we should perhaps designate it in England, 
is made once or twice in the week, in every famuy of respectabUityin 
France; and by the poorer classes as 
often as their means will enable them to 
substitute it for the y^;etable or maigre 
soups, on which they are more commonly 
obliged to subsist. It is served usually 
on tne first daj with slices of untoasted 
. bread soaked m it ; on the second, it is 
r generally varied with vermicelli, rice, 
or semoulina. The ingredients are, of 
course, often otherwise proportioned 
than as we have given them, and more or less meat is allowed 
according to the taste or circumstances of the persons for whom 
the bouillon is prepared ; but the process of malcing it is always the 
same, and is thus described (rather learnedly) by one of the most 
skilful cooks in Europe: ^*The stock-pot of the French artisan,'* 
says Monsieur Car^me, "supplies his principal nourishment; and 
it is thus managed by his wife, who, without the slightest know- 
ledge of chemistry, conducts the process in a truly scientific man- 
ner. She first lays the meat into an earthen stock-pot, and pours cold 
water to it in the proportion of about two quarts to three |>ounds of 
the beef;* she then places it by the side of the fire, where it slowly 
becomes hot; and as it does so, the heat enlarges the fibre of the meat, 
dissolves the gelatinous substances which it contains, allows the albu- 
men (or the muscular part which produces the scum) to disengage 
itself, and rise to the surface, and the ozmazome (which ie the most 
savoury part of the meat) to be difiused through the broth. Thus, from 
the simple circumstance of boiling it in the gentlest manner, a relish- 
ing ana nutritious soup will be obtained, and a dish of tender and 
palatable meat ; but if the pot be placed and kept over a quick fire, 
the albumen will coagulate, narden the meat, prevent the water from 
penetrating it, and the osmazome from disengaging itself; the result 
will be a broth without flavour or goodness, and a tough, dry bit of 
meat" 

It must be observed in addition, that as the meat of which the 
bouillon is made, is almost invariably sent to table, a part of the rump, 
the mouse-buttock, or the leg-of-mutton piece of bee( should be 
selected for it ; and the simmering should be continued only until this 
is perfectly tender. When the object is simply to make good, pure-

flavoured, beef broth, part cf the shin or Icff, with a pound or two of 
the neck, will best answer the pnrpoee. Wnen the bauilU (that is to 
8B7, the beef which is boiled in the soup), is to be served, bind it into 
a good shape, add to it a calf s foot if easily procurable, as this much 
improTes tne quality of the houiUon ; pour cold water to it in the pro- 
portion mentioned above, and proceed, as Monsieur Car6me directs, to 
Leat the soup slowly by the side of the fire ; remove carefully the 
head of scum wluch ¥nll gather on the surface before the boiling com- 
mences, and continue the skimming at intervals for about twenty 
minutes longer, pourinj^ in once or twice a little cold water. Next, 
sdd salt in the proportion of two ounces to the gallon ; this will cause 
a little more scum to rise ; clear it quite off and throw in three or 
four turnips, as many carrots, half ahead ofoeleir, four or five young 
leeks, an onion stuck with six or eight cloves, a lai^ half tea-spoon- 
ful of peppercorns, and a bunch of savoury herbs. Let the whole 
stew VBBT softly without ceasing, from four hours and a half to six 
hooTB, according to the quantity: the beef in that time will be ex- 
tremely tender but not overdone. It vnll be excellent eating if pro- 
perly manajged, and might often, we think, be substituted with great 
sdvantage &r the hard, half-boiled, salted beef so often seen at an 
English table. It should be served with a couple of cabbages, which 
have been first boiled in the usual way, then pressed very dir, and 
stewed for ten minutes in a little of the brotn, and seasoned with 
pepper and salt. The other vef^etableR from the bouillon may 
be laid round it or not at choice. The soup if served on the same 
day must be strained, well cleared from fat, and sent to table with 
fried or toasted breEKl, unless the continental mode of putting slices or 
crosts of unioasted bread into the tureen, and soaking them for ten 
minutes in a ladleful or two of the bouillon^ be, from custom, pre- 
ferred. 

Beef, 8 to 9 lbs. ; water, 6 quarts ; salt, 3 oz. (more, if needed) ; 
carrots, 4 to 6 ; turnips, 4 or 5 ; celery, one small head ; leeks, 4 to 
6; one onion, stuck with 6 cloves; peppercorns, one small teaspoon- 
fid; large bunch of savoury herbs (calfs foot if convenient) ; to 
nmmer 5 to 6 hours. 

Obi, 1. — This broth forms in France the foundation of all richer 
soups and gravies. Poured on fresh meat (a portion of which should 
be veal) instead of water, it makes at once an excellent consommS or 
strong jellied stock. If properly managed, it is very clear and pale ; 
and with an additional weight of beef and some spoonsful of glaze 
may easily be converted into an amber-coloured gravy-soup, suited to 
modem taste. 

Obi. 2. — It is a common practice abroad to boil poultry, pigeons, 
and even game, in the pot-au-feu or soup-pot.* They should be pro- 
perly trussed, stewed in the broth just long enough to render tncm 
tender, and served, when ready, with a good sauce. A small ham,

msty or blackened parts, laid with the beef when the water is first 
added to it, and boiied from three hours and a half to four hours in 
the bauiUon, is very superior in flavour to those cooked in water only, 
and infinitely improves the soup, which cannot however so well be 
eaten until the following day, when all the fat can easily be taker 
from it : it would, of course, require no salt 

CLEAR, PALE GBATY SOUP OR CONSOMMi. 

Rub a deep stewpan or soup- pot with butter, and lay into it 
three quarters of a pound of ham freed entirely from fat, skin, 
and rust, four pounds of leg or neck of veal, and the same wcieht 
of lean beef, all cut into thick slices; set it over a clear and rather 
brisk fire, until the meat is of a fine amber-colour ; it must be often 
moved, and closeljr watched, that it may not stick to the pan, nor 
bum. When it is equally browned, lay the bones upon it, and 
pour in gradually four quarts of boiling water. Take off the scum 
carefully as it rises, and throw in a pint of cold water at intervals 
to bring it quickly to the surface. When no more appears, add 
two ounces of salt, two onions, two large carrots, two turnips, one 
head of celery, a fageot of savoury herbs, a dozen cloves, half a tea- 

rnful of whole white pepper, and two large blades of mace. I^ 
soup boil gently from five hours and a half to six hours and 
a half: then strain it through a very clean fine cloth, laid in a 
hair sieve. When it is perfectly cold, remove every pulicle of fat 
from the top ; and, in taking out the soup, leave the sediment un- 
touched ; heat in a clean pan the quantity required for table, add salt 
to it if needed, and a few drops of chili or of^cayenne vine^. Har- 
vey's sauce, or very fine mushroom catsup, may be substituted for 
these. When thus prepared the soup is ready to serve : it should be 
accompanied by pale sippets of fried bread, or sippets a la reine. (At 
tables where English modes of service entirely prevailed, clear gravy- 
soup, until very recently, was always accompanied by dice, or sip- 
pets as they are called, of delicately toasted bread. These are now 
seldom seen, but some Italian paste, or nicely prepared v^etable, is 
served in the soup instead). Rice, macaroni in lengths or in rings, 
vermicelli, or nauillei^ may in turn be used to vary it ; but they must 
always be boiled apart, till tender, in broth or water, and well drained 
before they are slipped into it. The addition of young vegetables, 
too, and especially of asparagus, will convert it into superior spring- 
soup; but they, likewise, must be separately cooked. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR GRAVY SOUP. 

Instead of browning the meat in its own juices, put it with the onions 
and carrots, into a deep stewpan, with a quarter of a pint of bouillon ; 
set it over a brisk fire at first, and when the broth is somewhat re- 
duced, let it boil gently until it has taken a fine colour, and forms a

glaze (or jelly) at the bofctom of ihe stewpan; then pour to it the pro- 
per quantity of water, and finish the soup by the preceding receipt.* 

oSff. — A rich, old-fashioned English brown gravy-soup may be made 
with beef only. It should be cut from the bones, dredged with flour, 
seasoned with pepper and salt, and fried a clear brown ; wen stewed for 
six hours, if the quantity be large, with a pint of water to each pound 
of meat, and vegetables as above, except onions, of which four mode- 
rate-ttzed ones, also fHed, are to be added to every three quarts of 
the soup, which, after it has been strained and cleared from fat, may 
be thickened with six ounces of fresh butter, worked up very smoothly 
inth five of flour. In twenty minutes afterwards, a tablespoonful of 
&e best soy, half a pint of sherry, and a little cayenne, may be added 
to the Boupt which will then be ready to serve. 

CHEAP, CLeAr, OBATY BOUP. 

The shin or 1^ of beef, if not large or coarae, will answer extremely 
well for this soup, and afford at the same time a highly economical 
dish of boiled meat, which will be found very tender, and yery palat" 
able also, if it be served with a sauce of some piauancy. From about 
ten pounds of the meat let the butcher cut evenly off five or six from 
the thick flc»hy part, and again divide the knuckle, that the whole 
may lie compactly in the vessel in which it is to be stewed. Pour in 
throe quarts of cold water, and when it has been brought slowly to 
boil, and been well skinuned, as directed for houiUan (Page 8), throw 
in an ounce and a half of salt, half a large teaspoonful of pepper- 
corns, eight cloves, two blades of mace, a laggot of savoury herbs, a 
couple of small carrots, and the heart of a root of celery ; to these add 
a Doild onion or not, at choice. When the whole has stewed very 
softly for four hours, probe the larger bit of beef, and if quite tender, 
lift it out for table ; let the soup be simmered from two to three hours 
longer, and then strain it through a fine sieve, into a clean pan. 
When it is perfectly cold, clear off every particle of fat ; heat a couple 
of quarts, stir in, when it boils, half an cunce of sugar, a small table- 
spoonful of good soy, and twice as muon of Harvey's sauce, or instead 
of this, of clear and fine mushroom catsup. If carefully made, the 

• The juices of meat, drawn ont with a small portion of Uqnid, as directed 
here, may easily be reduced to the consistency in which they form what is cdled 
giari: for particolars of this, see Chapter IV. The best method, though perhaps 
not the easiest, of making the clear, amber-coloured stock, is to pour a ladleful 
or two of pale but strong beef*broth to the veal, and to boil it bnskly until well 
reduced, thrusting a knife when this is done into the meat, to let die juices escape ; 
then to proceed more slowly and cautiously as the liauid approaches Uie state in 
which it would bum. It must be allowed to take a aark amber-colour only, and 
the meat must be turned, and often moved in it When the desired point is 
reached, pour in more boiling broth, and let the nan remain off the fire i!or a few 
minutes, to detach and melt &e glaze ; then shake it wM round before the boil-

stiiTed into strong, dearj pale stock, would produce the desired effect of this, 
with maeh less trouble.

flonp will be perfectly transparent and of good colour and flavour. A 
thick slice of lean ham will improve it, and a pound or bo of the nec^k 
of beef with an additional pint of water, will likewise enrich its quality. 
A small quantity of good broth may be made of the fragments of the 
whole boued down with a few fresh vegetables. 

Brown caper, or hot horse-radish sauce, or sauce Robert, or iouce 
piquante, made with the liquor in which it is boiled, may be served 
with the portion of the meat which is sent to table. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

(Potage an Vermicelle.) 

Drop very lightly, and by degrees, six ounces of vermicelli, broken 
rather small, into three ouarts of boiling bouillon or clear gravy soup ; 
let it simmer for half an nour* over a ^ntle fire, and stir it often. This 
is the common French mode of makmg vermicelli soup, and we can 
recommend it as a particularly food one for family use. In England 
it is customary to soak, or to blanch the vermicelli, then to drain it 
well, and to stew it for a shorter time in the soup ; the quantity also, 
must be reduced quite two ounces, to suit modem taste. 

Bouillon, or gravy soup, 3 quarts; vermicelli, 6 oz.; 30 minutes. 
Or, soup, 3 quarts ; vermicelli, 4 oz. ; blanched in boiling water 6 
minutes ; stewed in soup 10 to 15 minutes. 

8BM0ULINA SOUP. 

(Soupe a la Simovie,) 

Semoulina is used in the same way as the vermicelli. It should be 
dropped very lightly and by degprecs into the boiling soup, which 
should be stirred all the time it is being added, and very frequently 
afterwards ; indeed, it should scarcely be quitted until it is ready 
for table. Skim it carefully, and let it simmer from twenty to five- 
and-twenty minutes. This, when the semoulina is good and fresh, 
is, to our taste, an excellent soup. 

Soup, 3 quarts; semoulina, 6 oz. ; nearly, or quite 25 minutes. 

* When of very fine qoalitj, the vermicelli will usually require less boilmg 
than this. We have named to the reader, in another part of the volume, Mr. 
Oobbett, 18, Pall Mall, as supplying all the Italian pastes extremely good. There 
are, of course, many other houses in London where they may be procured equally 
80 ; but in naming Mr. Cobbett, who is personally unknown to us, we merely 
give the result of our ovm experience of many years. Some articles of very 
superior quality purchased for us at his warehouse by a person merely commis- 
sioned to procure the best that could be had "from Toum" first directed om 
attention to his house (along established one, we believe), which is justly noted, 
especially amongst affluent country families, for the excellence of the goods 
which it sends out. We give this explanation, because it seems invidious to 
select, firom the large number of deservedly celebrated establishments of the same 
class which are to be found here, any one in particular for mention in t wcrk of 
this nature. 



CBAP. L] SOUPS. 13. 

MACARONI SOUP. 

Throw four ounces of fine fresh^ mellow Naples macearoni into a 
pan of fast-boiling water, with about an ounce of fresh butter, and a 
small onion stuck with three or four cloyes.t When it has swelled 
to its full size, and become tender, drain it well, cut it into half-inch 
len^hs, and slip it into a couple of quarts of clear gravj-soup : let 
it simmer for a few minutes, when it will be ready for table. Ob- 
serre, that the macaroni should be boiled quite tender; but it 
should by no means be allowed to burst, nor to become pulpy. 
Seire grated Parmesan cheese with it. 

Macaroni, 4 oz.; butter, 1 oz. ; 1 small onion; 5 doves; ] hour, 
or more. In soup, 5 to 10 minutes. 

O&ff.— The macaroni for soups should always be either broken 
into short lengths before it is boiled, or cut as above, or sliced 
qniddy into small rings not more than the sixth of an inch thick 
after it is boUed, unless the cut or ring macaroni, which may be 
parchased at the Italian warehouses, be used ; this requires but ten 
minutes* boiling, and should be dropped into the soup in the same 
way as vermicdli.} Pour oimces of it will be sumcient for two 
quarts of stock. It may be added to white soup afler having been 
previously boiled in water or veal-broth, and well drained from it : 
It has a rather elegant appearance in clear gravy-soup, but should 
have a boil in water before it is thrown into it. 

If served in very clear bright stock (consomme)^ it should be boiled 
apart until tender in a little good broth, which ought also to be clear 
and entirely free from fat ; then well drained, and put into the soup 
for a minute, or into the tureen, the instant bdfoie the soup is 
dished. 

BOUP OF SOVJEE. 

The soujee id of Indian origin, but is now well manufactured in 
£i^Iand,§ and is, we think, somewhat more delicate than semoulina 
in l^vour ; and being made firom wheat of the finest qualitv, is also 
quite as nutritious, or more so. For each quart of soup allow two 
ounces of soujee (the proportions can always be otherwise adapted 
to the taste after the first trial) ; drop it ^adually into the boiling 
liquid, and sinmier it for ten or twelve mmutes. Bullock's semola 
is another preparation which may be used in exactly the same 
manner to thicken soup ; but both this and soujee are more expen- 
sive at present than semoulina. 

* We most here repeat our varning agunst the use of long-kept macaroni, 
▼ermicelU, or semoTilina ; as when stale they will render any dish into which 
they arrintrodnced quite unfit for table. 

i For white soaps omit the onion. 

\ For the different varieties of macaroni and rermicelli, and the time reqnlif d 
to boil each of them, see Chapter XXI.

POTAGB AUX NOUILLESy OR TAILLBHINE SOUP 

Make into noutfle-pafite, with very fine dry flour, the yolks of 
four fresh eggs, and when ready cut, drop it gradually into five pints 
of boiling soup ; keep this gently stirred for ten minutes, skim it 
well, and serve it quickly. This is a less common, and a more deli- 
cately flavoured soup than the vermicelli, provided always that the 
nouiUes be made with* really fresh eggs. The same paste may be 
cut into very small diamonds, squares, stars, or any other form, then 
left to dry a little, and boiled in the soup until swollen to its full 
sjze, and tender. 

iVbtttiZe-paste of four eggs ; soup, 5 pints : 10 minutes. 

8AG0 SOUP. 

Wash in several waters, and float off the dirt from six ounces of 
fine pearl sago ; put it into three quarts of good cold gravy-stock ; 
let it stew gently from half to three quarters of an hour, and stir it 
occasionally, that it may not bum nor stick to the stewpan. A 
quarter of an ounce more of sago to each pint of liquid, will thicken 
it to the consistence of peas-soup. It may be flavoured with half a 
wineglassful of Harvey*s sauce, as much cayenne as it may need, the 
juice of half a lemon, an ounce of sugar, and two glasses of sherry ; 
or these may be omitted, and good beef-broth may be substituted 
for the gravy-soup, for a simple family dinner, or for an invalid ; or, 
again, it may be converted into inexpensive white soup by the addi- 
tion of some cream smoothly mixed with a dessertspoonful of arrow- 
root, or of thick cream and new milk in equal portions. Veal broth 
would be the most appropriate for this, or it might be made with 
half veal and half mutton. 

Sago, 6 oz. ; soup, 3 quarts : 30 to 45 minutes. 

TAPIOCA SOUP. 

This is made in the same manner, and with the same proportions 
as the preceding soup, but it must be simmered from fiuy to sixty 
minutes. 

RICE SOUP. 

In France, this soup is served well thickened with the rice, which 
is stewed in it for upwards of an hour and a half, and makes thus, 
even with the common bouillon of the country, an excellent i^'inter 
fotage. Wipe in a diy cloth, eight ounces of the best rice ; add it, 
m small portions, to four quarts of hot soup, of which the boiling 
should not be checked as it is thrown in. When a clear soup is 
wanted wash the rice, give it five minutes* boil in water, drain it 
well, throw it into as much boiling stock or well-flavoured broth as 
will keep it covered till done, and simmer it very softly until the 
grains are tender but still separate ; drain it, drop it into the soup, 
and let it remain in it a few mmutes Before it is served, but without

fiminerin^. When stewed in the stock it may he pat at once, after 
heing drained, into the tureen, and the clear eonaammi may he poured 
to it. 

An easy English mode of making rice-soup is this : put the rice 
into plenty of cold water ; when it boils throw in a small (quantity of 
salt, let it simmer for ten minutes, drain it well, throw it into the 
boiling soup, and simmer it gently from ten to fifteen minutes 
longer.* An extra quantity of stock must be allowed for the reduc- 
tion of this soup which is always considerable. 

WHITE RICE SOUP. 

Throw four ounces of well-washed rice into boiling water, and in 
fire minutes after pour it into a sieve, drain it well, and put it into a 
eouple of quarts of good white boiling stock ; let it stew until tender ; 
season the soup with salt, cayenne, and pounded mace; stir to it 
three quarters of a pint of yery rich cream, give it one boil, and 
serve it quickly. 

Rice, 4 oz. : boiled 5 minutes Soup, 2 quarts : f hour or more. 
Seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne ; cream, i pint : 1 minute. 

RICE-FLOUR SCOP. 

Mix to a smooth batter, with a little cold broth, eight ounces of 
fine rice-flour, and pour it into a couple of quarts of fast-boiling 
broth or gravy soup. Add to it a eeasoning of mace and cayenne, 
with a litUe salt if needful. It will require but ten minutes* lioiling. 

Soup, 2 quarts; rice-flour, 8 oz. : 10 minutes. 

Obf. — ^Two dessertspoonsful of currie-powder, and the strained 
juice of half a moderate-sized lemon will greatly improve this soup : 
It may also be converted into a ^ood common white soup (if it be 
made of veal stock), by the addition of three quarters of a pint of 
thick cream to the rice. 

STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP. 

Though a knuckle of veal is usually preferred for this stock, part 
of the neck will answer for it very well. Whichever joint be chosen, 
let it be thoroughly washed, once or twice divided, and laid into a 
delicately dean soup-pot, or well-tinned large stout iron saucepan, 
upon a pound of lean nam, freed entirely from skin and fat, and cut 
into thick slices; or, instead of this,, on half a pound of the Jewish 
smoked beef, of which we have already spoken, and from which the 
smoked surface, and all fat, must be careniUy carved away. 

Dutch or hung beef also will answer the same purpose, but similar 
precautions must be observed with regard to the smoked portions of 
either ; as they would impart a very unpleasant flavour to any pre- 
paration. Should very rich soup be wished for, pour in a pint ocAr 
af cold water for each pound of meat, but otherwise a pint and a half 

* TIm Pstna requires mtieh less boiling tlum the Carolina. 



If) MODEBN COOKEBT. [chap. z. 

may be allowed. When the soup has been thoroughly cleared from 
scum, which should be carefully taken off from the tmie of its first 
beginning to boil, throw in an ounce of salt to the gallon (more can 
be added afterwards if needed), two mild onions, a moderate-sized 
head of celery, two carrots, a small teasnoonful of whole white 
pepper, and two blades of mace ; and let the soup stew very softly 
from five to six hours, if the quantity be large : it should simmer 
until the meat falls from the l)ones. The skin of a calf *s head, a 
calf s foot, or an old fowl may always be added to this stock with 
good^ effect. Strain it into a dean deep pan« and keep it in a cool 
place till wanted for use. 

Lean ham, 1 lb. ; yeal, 7 lbs ; water, 4 to 6 quarts ; salt, 1^ oz. 
(more if needed); onions, 2; celery, 1 head; carrots, 2; pepper- 
corn^ 1 teaspoonful ; mace, 2 blades : 5 to 6 hours. 

HUTTON-STOCK FOR SOUPS. 

Equal parts of beef and mutton, with the addition of a small por- 
tion of ham, or dried beef, make excellent stock, especially for winter- 
soups. The necks of fowls, the bones of an undressed calTs head, or 
of any uncooked joint, ma^ be added to it with advantage. According 
to the quality of soup desired, pour fh)m a pint to a pint and a half 
of cold water to each pound of meat ; and after the hquor has been 
well skimmed, on its beginning; to boil, throw in an ounce and a half 
of salt to the gallon, two small heads of celery, three mild middling- 
sized onions, three well-flavoured turnips, as many carrots, a faggot 
of thyme and parsley, half a teaspoonful of white peppercorns, twelve 
cloves, and a large blade of mace. Draw the soup-pot to the side of 
the fire, and boil the stock as gently as possible for about six hours ; 
then strain, and set it by for use. Be particularly careful to clear it 
entirely from fat before it is prepared for table. One third of beef 
or vecU^ with two of mutton, will make very good soup ; or mutton 
only will answer the purpose quite well upon occasion. 

Beef, 4 lbs. ; mutton, 4 lbs. (or, beef or veal from 2 to 3 lbs. ; 
mutton from 5 to 6 lbs.) ; water, 1 to 1) gallon; salt, IJ oz. ; mild 
turnips, 1 lb. ; onions, 6 oz. ; carrots, } lb. ; celery, 6 to 8 oz. ; I 
bunch of herbs ; peppercorns, i teaspoonful ; cloves, 12 ; mace, 1 large 
blade : 6 hours. 

O^j.—Salt should be used sparingly at first for stock in which 
any portion of ham is boiled ; allowance should also be made for its 
reduction, in case of its being required for gravy. 

MADEMOISELLE JENNY LIND's SOUP. 

(Auihentie Receipt. J 

This receipt does not merely bear the name of " Mademoiselle 
Lind,** but is in reality that of the soup which was constantly served 
to her, as it was prepared by her own cook. We are indebted for it

to the kindness of tbe very popnlar Swedish authoress, Miss Bremer, 
vfho lecdyed it direct from ner accomplished countrywoman.* 

The following proportions are for a tureen of this excellent 



Wash a quarter of a pound of the best pearl -sago until the water 
poured from it is clear ; then stew it quite tender and very thick in 
water or thick broth (it will require nearly or quite a ouart of liquid, 
which should be poured to it cold, and heated slowly) : then mix 
<;TBdually with it a pint of good boiling cream, and the yolks of four 
fresh (^gs, and mingle the whole caretully with two quarts of strong 
veal or beef stock, which should always he kept ready boiling. Send 
the soup immediately to table. 

THE LORD UAYOR's SOUP. 

Wash tborouehly two sets of moderate sized pigs* ears and feet from 
which the hair has been carefully removed ; add to them five quarts 
of cold water, and stew them very gently with a faggot . of savoury 
herbs, and one large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, for nearly four 
hours, when the ears may be lifted out ; stew the feet for another 
hour, then take them up, strain the soup, and set it in a cool place 
that it may become cold enough for the fat to be quite cleared from 
it. Next, bone the ears and feet, cut the flesh down into dice, throw 
a clean folded cloth over it, and leave it so until the soup requires to 
be prepared for table ; then strew upon it two tablespoonsful of sa- 
voury herbs minced small, half a saltspoonful of cayenne, a little 
white pepper, and some salt. Put into a large saucepan half a pound 
of good butter, and when it begins to sinuner thicken it gradually 
with as much flour as it will absorb ; keep these stirred over a very 
gentle Are for ten minutes or more, but do not allow them to take 
the slightest colour ; pour the soup to them by degrees, letting it boil 
up after each portion is added ; put in the meat, and half a pint of 
sherry ; simmer the whole from three to five minutes ; dish the soup, 
and slip into it two or three dozens of delicately fi'ied forcemeat- 
balls. (See Chapter Vm.) 

Pigs' feet, 8 ; ears, 4 ; water, 5 quarts ; bunch savoury herbs ; 1 
large onion; doves, 12 : 3* to 4 hours, feet, 1 hour more. Butter, 
nb.; flour, 6 oz.t : 10 to 12 minutes. Minced herbs, 2 tablespoons- 
ful; cayenne and common pepper, each J saltspoonful; salt, I tca- 
spoonfm or more ; sherry, I pmt : 3 to 5 minutes. Forcemeat-balls, 
2 to 3 dozens. 

Obf.-- We have given this receipt with the slightest possible varia- 
tion from the origiiml, which we derived from a neighbourhood where 

* We icere infcmned by Miss Bremer that Mademoiselle lind was in the 
habit of taking Uiis soup before she sang, as she found the sago and eggs sooth* 
jng to the chest, and beneficial to the Toice. 

f The safer plan for an inexperienced cook is to weigh the flour, and then to 
sprinkle it from a dredging-boz into the butter.

tDC soup made by it was extremely popular We have better adapted 
it to our own taste by the following alterations. 



THE LORD MAYOR S SOUP. 

(Author's Receipt) 

"We prefer to have this soup made, in part,, the evening before it is 
wanted. Add the same proportion of water to the ears and feet as in 
the preceding directions ; skim it thoroughly when it first boils, and 
til row in a tablespoonful of salt, two onions of moderate size, a small 
head of celery, a bunch of herbs, two whole carrots, a small teaspoon- 
ful of white peppercorns, and a blade of mace. Stew these softly un- 
til the ears and feet are perfectly tender, and, after they are lifted out, 
let the liquor be kept^W simmering only, while thev are being boned, 
that it may not be too much reduced. Put the bones back into it^ 
and stew them as gently as possible for an hour ; then strain the soup 
into a clean nan, and set it by until the morrow in a cool place. The 
flesh should oe cut into dice while it is still warm, and covered with 
the cloth before it becomes quite cold. To prepare the soup for table 
clear the stock from fat and sediment, put it into a very dean stew- 
pan, or deep saucepan, and stir to it when it boils, six ounces of the 
^nest rice-fiour smoothly mixed with a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
cayenne, three times as much of mace and salt, the strained jidce of a 
lemon, three tablespoonsful of Harvey's sauce, and half a pint of good 
sherry or I^fadeira. Simmer the whole for six or eight minutes, add 
more salt if needed, stir the soup often, and skim it thoroughly ; put 
in the meat and herbs, and after they have boiled gently for five 
minutes, dish the soup, add forcemeat-balls or not, at pleasure, and 
send it to table quickly. 

Moderate-sized pigs feet, 8 ; ears, 4 ; water, 6 quarts ; salt, 1 table- 
spoonful ; onions, 2; celery, 1 head; carroty 2; bunch of herbs v 
] cppercoms, 1 small teaspoonful ; mace, 1 blade : 3J to 4^ hours. 
Stock, 5 pints; rice-flour, 6 oz. ; cayenne, \ teaspoonful; mace and 
salt, each ] of a teaspoonful ; juice of 1 lemon ; Harvey's sauce, $ 
tablespoonsful ; sherry or Madeira, g pint : 6 to 8 minutes. Savoury 
herbs, 2 tablespoonsful : 5 minutes. 

Obs. 1. — Should the quantity of stock exceed five pints, an ad- 
ditional ounce or more of rice must be used, and the flavouring be al- 
together increased in proportion. Of the minced herbs, two-thirds 
should be parsley, and the remainder equal parts of lemon thyme and 
winter savoury, unless sweet basil should be at hand, when a tea- 
spoonful of it may be substituted for half of the parsley. To some 
tastes a seasoning of sage would be acceptable : and a slice or two of 
lean ham will much improve the flavour of the soup. 

Obs, 2. — Both this soup, and the preceding one, may be rendered 
very rich by substituting strong bouillon (see page 8) or good veal 
broth for water, in making them.

COCOA-NUT BOUP. 

Fkre fhe dark rind from a very fiesli coooa-nut, and fprate it down 
small on an exceedingly clean, bright gprater; weigh it, and allow 
two oanoes for each quart of sonp. Simmer it gently for one hour 
in the stock, which should Uien be strained doeely from it, and thick- 
ened for table. 

Veal stock, graTy-soup, or broth, 5 pints ; grated cocoa-nut, 5 oz. . 
1 hour. Flour of rice, 5 oz. ; mace, ) teaspoon! ul ; little cayenne and 
salt ; mixed with ) pint of cream : 10 minutes. 

Or: gravy-soup, or good beef broth, 5 pints : 1 hour. Bice flour, 
5 oz. ; soy and lemon-juice, each 1 tablespoonful ; finely pounded sugar» 
1 oz. ; cayenne, \ teaspoonful ; sherry, 2 glaasesful. 

Ohs. — When either cream or wine is objected to for these soups, 
a half-pint of the stock should be reserved to mix the thickening; 
with. 

CHESTNUT BOUP. 

Strip the outer rind from some fine, sound Spanish chestnutSr 
throw them into a large pan of warm water, and as soon as it becomes 
too hot for the fingers to remain in it, take it from the fire, lift out 
the chestnuts, peel them quickly, and throw them into cold water 
as they are done ; wipe, and weigh them ; take three quarters of a 
pound for each quart of soup, cover them with good stock, and stew 
them gently for upwards of three quarters of an hour, or until they 
break when touched with a fork ; drain, and pound them smoothly,. 
or braise them to a mash with a strong spoon, and rub them through 
a fine sieve reversed; mix with them by slow d^^rees the proper 
quantity of stock ; add sufiicient mace, cayenne, and salt to season the 
soup, and stir it often until it boils.* Three quarters of a pint of rich 
cream, or even less, will greatly improve it The stock in which the 
chestnuts are boiled can be used for the soup when its sweetness is 
not objected to ; or it may in part be added to it. 

Chestnuts, 1| lb. : stewed from | to 1 hour. Soup, 2 quarts ; sea- 
soning of salt, mace, and cayenne : 1 to 3 minutes. Cream, i pint 
(when used). 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE^ OR PALESTINE SOUP. 

Wash and pare quickly some freshly- dug artichokes, and to preserve 
Iheir colour, throw them into spring water as they are done, but do 
itot let them remain in it after all are ready. Boil three pounds of 
them in water for ten minutes ; lift them out, and slice tnem into 
three pints of boiling stock ; when they have stewed gently in this 
from nileen to twenty minutes, press them with the soup, through a 
fipe sieve, and put the whole into a clean saucepan with a pint and a 
half more of stock ; add sufficient salt and cayenne to season it, skim 
it well, and afler it has simmered for two or three minutes, stir it to a 
pint of rich boiling cream. Serve it immediately. 



20 MODERN COOKERY. [chip. i. 

Artichokes, 3 lbs., boiled in water : 10 minutefl. Veal stock, 3 pints : 
15 to 20 minutes. Additional stock, 1 i pint ; little cayenne and aUt ; 
2 to 3 minutes. Boiling cream, 1 pint. 

Obs. — The palest vefu stock, as for white soup, should be used for 
this ; but for a family dinner, or where economy is a consideration, 
excellent mutton-brotn, made the day before and perfectly cleared 
from fat, will answer very well as a substitute ; milk too maj in part 
take the place of cream when this last is scarce : the proportion or ar- 
tichokes should then be increased a little. 

Ye^table-marrow, when young, makes a superior soup even to 
this, which is an excellent one. it should be well pared, trimmed, 
and sliced into a small quantity of boiling yeal stock or broth, and 
«7hen perfectly tender, pressed tnrough a nne sieve, and nnxed with 
more stock and some cream. In France the marrow is stewed, first in 
butter, with a large mild onion or two also sliced ; and afterwards in 
a quart or more of water, which is poured gradually to it ; it is next 
parsed through a tammy,* seasoned with pepper and salt, and mixed 
with a pint or two of nulk and a little cream. 

COMMON CARROT SOUP. 

The most easy method of making this fiiyourite English soup is to 
boil some highly coloured carrots quite tender in water shghtly salted, 
then to pound or mash them to a smooth paste, and to mix with them 
boiling gravy soup or strong beef broth fsee BouUlon) in the pro- 
portion of two quarts to a pound and a half of the prepared carrots ; 
then to pass the whole through a strainer, to season it with mlt and 
cayenne, to heat it in a clean stewpan, and to serve it immediately. 
If only the red outsides of the carrots be used, the colour of the soup 
will be very bright * they should be weighed i^fler they are mashed 
Turnip soup may be prepared in the same manner. 

Oh»,—Aji experienced and observant cook will know the proportion 
of vegetables required to thicken this soup appropriately, without 
having recourse to weights and measures ; but the learner nad always 
better proceed by rule. 

Soup, 2 quarts ; pounded carrot, 1} lb. ; salt, cayenne : 5 minutes. 

A FINER CARROT SOUP. 

Scrape very clean, and cut away all blemishes from some highly- 
fiavoui^ red carrots ; wash, and wipe them dry, and cut them into 
quarter-inch slices. Fat into a large stewpan three ounces of the 
best butter, and when it is melted, add two pounds of the sliced 
carrots, and let them stew gently for an hour without browning ; 
pour to them then four pints and a half of brown gravy soup, and 
when they have simmered from fifty minutes to an hour, they ought 
to be sufficiently tender. Press them through a sieve or strainer with 
the soup; add salt, and cayenne if required ; boil the whole gently

for fire imnates, take off all the scum, and serve the soup as hot as 
poe^ble. 

Butter, 3 oz. ; carrots, 2 lbs. : 1 hour. Soup, 4} pints : 50 to CO 
minutes. Salt, cayenne : 5 minutes. 

COMMON TURNIP SOUP. 

Wash and wipe the turnips, pare and weigh them ; allow a pound 
and a half for every quart of soup. Cut them in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick. Melt four ounces of butter in a clean stew- 
pan, and put in the turnips before it begins to boil ; stew them gently 
for three quarters of an hour, taking care that they shall not brown, 
then have the proper (quantity of soup ready boiling, pour it to them, 
and let them simmer in it for three quarters of an hour. Fulp the 
whole through a coarse sieve or soup strainer, put it again on the fire, 
keep it stirr^ until it has boiled three minutes or four, take off the 
■cum, add salt and pepper if required, and serve it very hot. 

Turnips, 3 lbs. ; butter, 4 oz. : i hour. Soup, 2 quarts . i hour. 
I^ast time : three minutes. 

A dUICKLY MADE TUBNIP SOUP. 

Fare and slice into three pints of veal or mutton stock or of good 
broth, three pounds of young mild turnips ; stew them gently from 
twenty-five to thirtv mmutes, or until thev can be reduced quite to 
pulp ; rub the whole through a sieve, and add to it another quart 
of stock, a seasoning of salt and white pepper, and one lump of susar ; 
give it two or three minutes* boil, skim and serve it. A large white 
onion when the flavour is liked may be sliced and stewed with the 
turnips. A little cream improves much the colour of this soup. 

Tuxnips, 3 lbs. ; soup, 5 pints : 25 to 30 minutes. 

POTATO SOUP. 

Mash to a smooth paste three pounds of good mealy potatoes, which 
have been steamed,* or boiled very dry ; mix with them by degrees, 
two quarts of boiling broth, pass the soup through a strainer, set it

strainer, add a small teaspoonful of powdered ginger and plenty of 
pepper, ttinuuer the soup for a couple of minutes, skim, and serve it 
yerv hot, accompanied by a dish of rice, boiled as for curries. 

Broth, 5 pints ; apples, 1| lb. : 2^ to 40 minutes. Ginger, 1 tea- 
spoonful ; pepper, } teaspoonful : 2 minutes. 

PABSNBP SOUP. 

Dissolye, over a gentle fire, four ounces of good butter, in a wide 
stcwpan or saucepan, and slice in directly two pounds of sweet tender 
parsneps; let them stew very gently until all are quite soft, then 
pour in CTadually sufficient yeal stock or good broth to coyer them, 
and boil the whole slowly from twenty minutes to half an hour; 
work it with a wooden spoon through a fine sieye, add as 
much stock as will make two quarts in all, season the soup with 
salt and white pepper or cayenne, giye it one boil, skim, and 
serye it yery hot. Send pale fhed sippets to table with it. 

Butter, 4j[ oz. ; parsneps, 2 lbs. : f hour, or more. Stock, 1 quart ;

Ohs.—Wt can particularly recommend this soup to those who 
like the peculiar flavour of the yegetable. 

ANOTHER PARBNEP SOUP. 

Slice into five pints of boiling yeal stock or strong colourless 
broth, a couple of pounds of parsneps, and stew them as gently as 
possible from thirty minutes to an nour ; when they are perfectly 
tender, press them through a sieve, strain the soup to them, season,

Yeal stock or broth, 5 pints ; parsneps, 2 lbs. : 30 to 60 minutes. 
Salt and cayenne : 2 minutes. 

WESTERFIELD WHITB SOUP. 

Break the bone of a knuckle of yeal in one or two places, and put 
it on to stew, with three quarts of cold water to the five pounds of 
meat; when it has been quite cleared from scum, add to it an ounce 
and a half of salt, and one mild onion, twenty corns of white pepper, 
and two or three blades of mace, with a little cayenne pepper. Wnea 
the soup is reduced one-third by slow simmering stram it ofl^ and 
set it by till cold ; then free it carefully from the fat and sediment, 
and heat it aeain in a very clean stewpan. Mix with it when it 
boils, a pint of thick cream smoothly blended with an ounce of goop 
arrowroot, two ounces of yery fresh yermicelli previously boiled 
tender in water slightly salted and weU drained from it, and an ounce 
and a half of almonds blanched and cut in strips : give it one minute**

ommer, and serve it immediately, with a French roll in the 
tureen. 

Veal, 5 lbs.; water, 3 quarts; salt, 1) oz. ; 1 mild onion; 20 
eoma white pepper; 2 large blades of mace: 6 hours or mora. 
Cream, 1 pint ; almonds, 1| oz. ; vermicelli, 1 oz. : 1 minute. Little 
thickening if needed. 

Obt. — We have given this receipt without any variation from the 
original, as the soup made by it — of which we have often partaken-> 
seemed alwavs much approved b^ the guests of the hospitable 
country gentleman from whose family it was derived, and at whose 
well-arranged table it was very commonly served ; but we would 
suggest the suppression of the almond spikes, as they seem un- 
soited to the preparation, and also to the taste of the present day. 

▲ RICHER WUITB SOUP. 

Pound very fine indeed six ounces of sweet almonds, then add to 
them six ounces of the breasts of roasted chickens or partridges, and 
three ounces of the whitest bread which has been soaked in a little 
veal broth, and squeezed very dry in a cloth. Beat these altogether 
to an extremely smooth paste; then pour to them boiling and by 
d^rees, two quarts of rich veal stock; strain the soujp tnrou^h a 
fine hair sieve, set it again over the fire, add to it a pint of thick 
cream, and serve it, as soon as it is at the point of boiling. When 
cream is very scarce, or not easily to be procured, this soup may be 
thickened sufficiently without it, by increasing the quantity of 
almonds to eight or ten oxmces, and pouring to them, after they have 
been reduced to the finest paste, a pint of boiling stock, which must 
be again wrung firom them through a coarse cloth with very strong 
pressure: the proportion of meat and bread also should then be 
nearly doubled. The stock should be well seasoned with mace and 
cayenne before it is added to the other ingredients. 

Almonds, 6 oz. ; breasts of chickens or partridges, 6 oz. ; soaked 
bread, 3 oz. ; veal stock, 2 quarts; cream, 1 pint. 

Obs. 1. — Some persons pound the yolks of four or five hard-boiled 
tgg^ with the almonds, meat, and bread for this white soup ; French 
cooks beat smoothly with them an ounce or two of whole rice, pre- 
viously boiled from fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Obs, 2. — A good plain white soup may be made simply by adding to 
a couple of ouarts of pale veal stock or strong well-flavoured veal 
broth, a thickening of arrow-root, and from half to three ouarters 
of a pint of cream.* Four ounces of macaroni boiled tender and 
well-<&ained may be dropped into it a minute or two before it is 
dished, but the thidtemng may then be diminished a little

becf^ or of the seek, with two or three carrots, one onion, a small 
head of celery, a hunch of savoury herhs, a blade of mace, a half- 
teaspoonful of peppercorns, and an ounce of salt. When the meat 
is quite in fragments, strain off the broth, and pour it when cold 
upon three pounds of the knuckle or of the neck of veal ; simmer this 
until the flesh has quite fallen from the bones, but be careful to stew 
it as sofliy as possible, or the quantity of stock will be so much 
reduced as to be insufficient for the soup. Next, take the half of a 
fine calfs head toith the skin on^ remove the brains, and then bone 
it* entirely, or let the butcher do this, and return the bones with it ; 
these, when there is time, may be stewed with the veal to enrich 
the stock, or boiled afterwards with the head and tongue. Strain 
the soup through a hair-sieve into a clean pan, and let it drain 
closely from the meat. When it is nearly or quite cold, clear off all 
the fat from it; roll the head lightly round, leaving the tongue 
inside, or taking it out, as is most convenient, secure it with tape 
or twine, pour the soup over, and bring it gently to boil upon 
a moderate fire; keep it well skimmed, and simmer it from an 
hour to an hour and a quarter ; then lift the head into a deep 
pan or tureen, add the soup to it, and let it remain in untd 
nearly cold, as this will prevent the edges from becoming dark. Cut 
into quarter-inch slices, and then divide into dice, from six to eight 
ounces of the lean of an undressed ham, and if possible, one of 
good flavour ; free it perfectly from fat, rind, and the smoked edges ; 
peel and slice four moderate-sized eschalots, or if these should not be 
at hand, one mild onion in lieu of them. Dissolve in a well-tinned 
stewpan or thick iron saucepan which holds a gallon or more, four 
ounces of butter ; put in the ham and eschalots, or onion, with half a 
dozen cloves, two middling-sized blades of mace, a half-teaspoonful of 
peppercorns, three or four very small sprigs of thyme, three tea- 
spoonsful of minced parsley, one of lemon thyme and winter savoury 
mixed, and when the flavour is thought appropriate, the very thin 
rind of half a small fresh lemon. Stew these as sofUy as possible 
for nearly or quite an hour, and keep the pan frequently snaken : 
then - put into a dredging box two ounces of fine dry flour, and 
spritdde it to them by degrees ; mix the whole well together, and 
ailer a few minutes more of gentle simmering, add very gradually 
five full pints of the stock taken free of fat and sediment, and made 
boiling before it is poured in ; shake the pan strongly round as the 
first portions of it are added, and continue to do so until it contains 
from two to three pints, when the remainder may be poured in at 
once, and the pan placed by the side of the fire that it may boil in 
the gentlest manner for an hour. At the end of that time turn the

whole into a hair-deye placed over a large pan, and if the liquid 
should not ran through freely, knock the aides of the sieve, hut do 
not force it through with a spoon, as that would sooil the appearance 
of the stock. The head in the meanwhile should have heen cut up, 
ready to add to it. Por the finest kind of mock turtle, only the 
skin, with the fat that adheres to it, should he used ; and this, with 
the tongue, should he cut down into one inch squares, or if preferred 
mto strips of an inch wide. For ordinary occasions, the lean part of 
the flesh may he added also, hut as it is always sooner done than the 
skin, it is better to add it to the soup a little later. When it is quite 
leady, put it with the strained stock into a clean pan, and simmer it 
from three quarters of an hour to a full hour : it should ue perfectly 
tender^ without being allowed to break. Cayenne, if needed, should 
be thrown into the stock before it is strained ; salt should be used 
spaiinglyf on accoimt of the ham, until the whole of the other ingre- 
dients have been mixed together, when a sufficient quantity must be 
stirred into the soup to season it properly. A couple of glasses of 
good sherry or Madeira, with a dessertspoonful of strain^ lemon- 
luice, are usually added two or three minutes only before the soup 
is dieted, that the spirit and flavour of the wine may not have time 
to evaporate; but it is sometimes preferred mellowed down by longer 
boiling. The proportion of lemon-juice may be doubled at will, but 
much add is not generally liked. We can assure the reader of the 
excellence of the soup made by this receipt; it is equally palatable 
and delicate, and not heavy or cloying to the stomach, like many of 
the elaborate compositions which bear its name. The fat, through 
the whole process, should be carefully skimmed off. The ham gives 
far more savour, when used as we have directed, than when, even in 
much lai^r proportion, it is boiled down in the stock. Two dozens 
of forcemeat-balls, prepared by the receipt No. 11, Chap. Yin., should 
be dropped iuto the soup when it is ready for table. It is no longer 
customary to serve ^g-balls in it.

Stewed down together when more conyenient : it is only necessary 
that a really good, well flavonred, and rather deeply-coloured stock 
should be prepared. A calfs foot is always an advantageous addition 
to it. and the skin of another calTs head* a better one still. 

Obg, 2. — A couple of dozens mushroom-buttons, cleaned with salt 
and flannel, then wiped very dry, and sliced, and added to the ham 
and herbs when they have been simmered together about half an 
hour, will be found an improvement to the soup. 

Claret is sometimes added instead of sherry or Madeira, but we do 
not think it would in general suit English taste so well. From two 
to three tablespoonsful of Harvey*s sauce can be stirred in with the 
wine when it is liked, or when the colour requires deepening. 

OLD-FASHIONED MOCK TURTLE. 

After having taken out the brain and washed and soaked the head 
well, pour to it nine quarts of cold water, bring it gently to boil, skim 
it veiy dean, boil it if laree an hour and a half, mt it out, and put 
into the liquor eight pounobB of neck of beef lightly browned in a little 
fresh butter, with three or four thick slices of lean ham, four large 
onions sliced, three heads of celery, three large carrots, a large bunch 
of savoury herbs, the rind of a lemon pared very thin, a dessertspoon- 
ful of peppercorns, two ounces of salt, and aller the meat has been 
taken from the head, all the bones and fragments. Stew these gently 
from six to seven hours, then strain off the stock and set it into a very 
cool place, that the fat may become firm enough on the top to be cleared 
off easily. The skin and fat of the head should be taken off together 
and divided into strips of two or three inches in length, and one in 
width ; the tongue may be carved in the same manner, or into dice. 
Put the stock, of which there ought to be between four and five 
quarts, into a large soup or stewpot ; thicken it when it boils with 
four ounces of fresh butterf mixea with an equal weight of fine dry 
flour, a half-teaspoonful of pounded mace, and a th^ as much of

should the soup require it, after it nas tailed some little time) ; pour

cleared from the head in detached portions with the hair on, but thia may easily 
be removed after a few minntes' scalding as from the head itself^ or the feet, by

of luace, eight or ten cloves, and a few white or black peppercorns. 
Let it boil gendy that it may not be too much reduced, for six or seven 
hours, then strain it into a clean pan and set it by for use. Take out 
the bone from half a cairs head with the skin on (the butcher will 
do this if desired), wash, roll, and bind it with a bit of tape or twine, 
and lav it into a stewpan, with the bones and tongue ; cover the whole 
with the beef stock, and stew it for an hour and a half; then lift it 
into a deep earthen pan and let it cool in the liquor, as this will pre- 
vent the ^ffes from becoming dry or discoloured. Take it out before it 
is quite cold ; strain, and skim all the fat carefully from the stock ; and 
heat five pints in a large clean saucepan, with the head cut into small 
thick slices or into inch-squares. As ouite the whole will not be 
needed, leave a portion of the fat, but add every morsel of the skin to 
the soup, and of the tongue also. Should the first of these not be 
perfectly tender, it must be simmered gently till it is so ; then stir 
mto the soup from six to eight ounces of fine rice-flour mixed with 
a quarter-teaspoonful of cayenne, twice as much freshly pounded 
mace, half a wineglassful of mushroom catsup,* and sufficient cold 
broth or water to render it of the consistence of batter ; boil the whole 
from eight to ten minutes ; take off the scum, and throw in two 
glasses of sherry ; dish the soup and put into the tureen some delicately 
and well fried forcemeat-balls made by the receipt No. 1, 2, or 3, of 
Chapter YIU. A small quantity of lemon-juice or other acid can be 
added at/ pleasure. The wine and forcemeat-balls may be omitted, 
and the other seasonings of the soup a little heightened. As much 
salt as may be re<]^uired should be added to the stock when the head 
first begins to boil in it : the cook must regulate also by the taste 
the exact proportion of cayenne, mace, and catsup, which will flavour 
the soup agreeably. The fragments of the head, with the bones and 
the residue of the beef used for stock, if stewed down together with 
some water and a few fresh vegetables, will afford some excellent 
broth, such as would be highly acceptable, especially if well thickened 
with rice, to many a poor family during the winter months.

and stew in H gently rixpennyworth of beef bones and rixpennyworth 
of pork-rinds. When the boiling is somewhat advaneod, throw in 
the skin of a calTs head ; and in an hour afterwards, or when it is 
quite tender, lift it out and set it aside till wanted. Slice and fry four 
large mild onions, stick into another ei^htor ten cloves, and put them 
into the soup after it has stewed from six to seven hours. Contmue the 
boiling for two or three hours longer, then strain off the soup, and let 
it remain until perfectly cold. 'NVnen wanted for table, take it ouite 
dear from the lat and sediment, and heat it anew with the skin or the 
calfs head cut into dice, three oimces of loaf sugar, four table- 
spoonsful of strained lemon-juice, two of soy, and three wine-glasses- 
fal of sherry ; give it one boil, skim it well, and serve it as hot as 
possible. Bait must be added to it sparingly in the first instance on 
account of the so^ : a proper seasoning of cayenne or pepper must not, 
of course, be omitted. 

This receipt was given to the writer, some years since, as a perfectly 
successful imitation of a soup which was then, and is still, she believes, 
selling in London at six shillings the quart. Never having tasted the 
original Soupe des GaUes she cannot say how far it is a correct one ; 
but she had it tested with great exactness when she received it hrst, 
and foimd the result a ver^ sood soup prepared at an extremely 
moderate cost. The pork-rinds, when long boiled, afford a strong 
and flavourless jelly, which might be advantageously used to give 
consistence to other soups. They may be procured during the win- 
ter, usually at the butcher's, but if not, at the porkshops : they 
should be carefully washed before they are put into the soup -pot. 
When a knuckle of veal cannot conveniently be had, a pound or two 
of the neck and a morsel of scrag of mutton may instead be boiled 
down with the beef-bones ; or two or three pounds of neck or shin 
of beef: but these will, of course, augment the cost of the soup.

WniTB 0Y8TBR SOUP. 

(or Oyster Soup a la Heine,) 

When the oysters are small, from two to three dozens for each 
pint of soup snould be prepared, but this number can of course 
be diminished or incref»ea at pleasure. Let the fish (which 
should be finely conditioned natives) be opened carefully ; pour the 
liquor from tnem, and strain it; rinse them in it well, and beard 
them ; strain the liquor a second time through a lawn sieve or folded 
muslin, and pour it again over the oysters. Take a portion from two 
quarts of the palest veal stock, and simmer the beards in it from 
twenty to thirty minutes. Heat the sonp, flavour it with mace and 
cayenne, and strain the stock from the oyster- beards into it. Flump 
the fish in their own liquor, but do not let them boil ; pour the

oysters into the tureen, dish the soup, and send it to table quickly. 
Should any thickening be required, stir briskly to the stock an ounce

with a little milk or cream ; or, in lieu of this, when a rich soup is 
liked, thicken it with four ounces of fresh butter well blended with 
three of flour.

RABBIT SOUP JL LA RKINE. 

Wash and soak thoroughly three yonng rabbits, pat them ^rhole 
into the soup-pot, and pour on them seven pints of cold 'vater or of 
dear veal broth ; when they have stewed gentlv about three quarters 
of an hour lilt them out, and take off the flesh of the backs, with & 
little from the legs should there not be half a pound of the former ; 
strip off the skin, mince the meat very small, and pound it to the 
smooth^t jmste ; cover it from the air, and set it' by. Put back into 
the soup the bodies of the rabbits, with two mild onions of moderate 
size, a head of celery, three carrots, a faggot of savoury herbs, two 
blades of mace, a half-teaspoonful of peppercorns, and an ounce of salt. 
Stew the whole softly three hours ; stram it off, let it stand to settle,, 
poor it gently from the sediment, put from four to five pints into a. 
clean stewpan, and mix it very graduaUy while hot with tne poimded 
labbit-flesn ; this must be done with care, for if the liquid be not 
added in very small portions at first, the meat will gather into lumps 
and will not easily be worked smooth afterwards. Add as much 
pounded mace and cayenne as will season the soup pleasantly, and pass 
It through a coarse but very clean sieve ; wipe out the stewpan, put 
back the soup into it, and stir in when it bous, a pint and a quarter 
of good cream* mixed with a tablespoonful of the best arrow-root : 
salt, if needed, should be thrown in previouslv. 

Yonng rabbits, 3; water, or clear veal broth, 7 pints : } of an hour. 
Bemains of rabbits ; onions, 2 ; celery, 1 head ; carrots, 3 ; savoury 
herhe; mace, 2 blades; white pepprcoms, a half-teaspoonful; salt,

salt, mace, and cayenne, if needed; cream, 1^ pint; arrowroot, 1 
tablespoonful (or 1^ ounce). 

BROWN RABBIT SOUP. 

Cut down into joints, flour, and fry lightly, two taU grown, or three 
young rabbits ; add to them three onions of moderate size, also fried 
to a dear brown ; on these pour gradually seven pints of boiling 
water, throw in a large teasi)oonful of salt, clear off aD the scum with 
care as it rises, and then put to the soup a faggot of parsley, four 
not Yery large carrots, and a small teaspoonful of peppercorns;. 
boil the whole very softly from five hours to five and ahau; add more 
salt if needed, strain off the soup, let it cool sufficiently for the fat to 
be skimmed clean from it, heat it afresh, and send it to table with sip- 
pets of fried bread. Spice, with a thickening of rice-flour, or of 
wfaeaten flour browned in the oven, and mixed with a spoonful or two 
of very good mushroom catsup, or of Harvey's sauce, can be added 
at pleasure to the above, with a few drops of eschalot-wine, or vine- 
gar ; but the simple receipt will be found extremely good without them.

SUPERLATIYE HARE SOUP. 

Cut down a bare into joints, and put into a soup-pot, or large stew- 
pan, with about a pouna of ieau nam, in thick slices, three moderate- 
sized mild onions, three blades of mace, a faggot of thyme, sweet mar- 
Boram, and parsley, and about three quarts of good beef stock. Let 
it stew very gently for full two hours from the time of its first 
beginning to boil, and more, if the hare be old. Strain the soup and 
pound together very fine the slices of ham and all the flesh of the 
back, legs, and shoulders of the hare, and put this meat into a stew- 
pan with the liquor in which it was boiled, the crumb of two French 
rolls, and half a pint of port wine. Set it on the stove to simmer 
twenty minutes; then ruo it through a sieve, place it a^ain on the 
stove till very hot, but do not let it boil : season it with salt and 
cayenne, and send it to table directly. 

Hare, 1 ; ham, 12 to 16 oz. ; onions, 3 to 6 ; mace, 3 blades ; fietg- 
got of savoury herbs ; beef stock, 3 quarts : 2 hours. Crumb of 2 
rolls ; port wine, J pint ; little salt and cayenne : 20 minutes. 



Pour on two pounds of neck or shin of beef and a hare well washed 
and carved into joints, one gallon of cold water, and when it boils and 
has been thoroughly skimmed, add an ounce and a half of salt, two 
onions, one large head of celery, three moderate-sized carrots, a tea- 
spoonful of black peppercorns, and six cloves. 

Let these stew very gently for three Lours, or longer, should the 
hare not be perfectly tender. Then take up the principal joints, 
cut the meat from them, mince, and pound it to a fine paste, with the 
crumb of two penny rolls (or two ounces of the crumb of household 
bread) which has been soaked in a little of the boiling soup, and then 
pressed very dry in a cloth ; strain, and mix smoothly with it the stock 
from the remainder of the hare ; pass the soup through a strainer, season 
it with cayenne, and serve it when at the point of boiling ; if not 
sufficiently thick, add to it a tablespoonful of arrow-root moistened 
with a little cold broth, and let the soup simmer for an instant after- 
wards. Two or three glasses of iwrt wine, and two dozens of small 
forcemeat-balls, may be added to this soup with good effect.

■OONOMICAL TUREET 80UP. 

The remains of a roast turkey, even after they have supplied the 
usual mince and broil, will furnish a tureen of cheap and excellent 
soup with the addition of a little fresh meat. Cut up rather small 
two pounds of the neck or other lean joint of beef, and pour to it five 
pints of cold water. Heat these yery slowly ; skim the liquor when 
it begins to boil, and add to it an ounce of salt, a small, mild onion 
(the proportion of all the yegetables may be much increased when 
tb^ are liked), a little celery, and the flesh and bones of the turkey, 
witn any gravy or forcemeat that may have been left with them. Let 
these boil gently for about three hours ; then strain off the soup through 
! sieve or cullender, and let it remain until the fat can be en- 



tirely removed from it. It may then be served merely well thickened 
with rice* which has previously been boiled very dry as for currie, and 
stewed in it for about ten minutes ; and seasoned with one large heaped 
tablespoonful or more of minced parsley, and as much salt and pepper 
or cayenne as it may require. Xhis, as the reader will perceive, is a 
somewhat frugal preparation, by which the residue of a roast turkey 
may be turned to economical account ; but it is a favourite, soup at 
some good English tables, where its very simplicity is a recommenda- 
tion. It can always be rendered more expensive^ and of richer qusJity, 
by ^e addition of lean ham or smoked beef,t a larger weight of fresh 
meat, and catsup or other store-sauces. 

Turkey soup d la reine is made precisely like the Potage a la Heine 
of fi>w]s or puUets, of which the receipt will be found in another part 
of this chapter. 

PHEASANT SOUP. 

Half roast a brace of weU-kept pheasants, and flour them rather 
thickly when they are first laid to tne fire. As soon as they are nearly 
cold take all the flesh from the breasts, put it aside, and keep it 
covered from the air ; carve down the remamder of the birds mto 
joints, bruise the bodies thoroughly, and stew the whole gently from 
two to three hours in five pints of strong beef broth ; then strain ofi 
the soup, and press as much of it as possible from the pheasants. 
Let it cool; and in the mean time strip the skins from the breasts, 
mince them small, and pound them to the finest paste, with hidf as 
much fresh butter, and naif of dry crumbs of bread ; season these well 
with cayenne, sufficiently with salt, and moderately with pounded 
maoe and grated nutmeg, and add, when their flavour is liked, three

or four eschalots prerioiuly bofled tender in a little of the soap, left 
till cold, and minced before they are put into the mortar. Moisten the 
mixture with the yolks of two or three eggs, roll it into small balls 
of equal size, dust a little flour upon them, skim all the fat from the 
soup, heat it in a clean stewpan, and when it boils throw them in and 
poach them from ten to twelve minutes, but first ascertain that the 
soup is properly seasoned with salt and cayenne. We have recom- 
mended that the birds should be partially roasted before they are put 
into the soup-pot, because their flavour is much finer when this is 
done than when they are simply stewed ; they should be placed rather 
near to a brisk fire that ihey may be quickly browned on the sur- 
fiice without losing any of their juices, and the basting should be con- 
stant. A slight thickening of rice-flour and arrow-lbot con be added 
to the soup at pleasure, and the fbrcemeat-balls may be fried 
and dropped into the tureen when they are preferred so. Half' 
a dozen eschalots lightly browned in butter, and a small head of 
celery, may also be thrown in after the birds begin to stew, but nothing 
should be allowed to prevail over the naturu flavour of the game 
itself; and this should be observed equally with other kinds, as par- 
tridges, grouse, and venison. 

Pheasants, 2 : roasted 20 to 25 minutes. Strong beef broth, or 
stock, 6 pints : 2 to 3 hours. Forcemeat-balls : breasts of pheasants, 
half as much diy bread-crumbs and of butter, salt, mace, cayenne ; 
yolks of 2 or 3 eggs (and at choice 3 or 4 boiled eschalots). 

0&«.— The stock may be made of six pounds of shin of beef, and 
four quarts of water reduced to within a pint of half. An onion, a large 
carrot, a bunch of savoury herbs, and some salt and spioe should be 
added to it : one pound of neck of veal or of beef will miprote it. 

ANOTHER PHEASANT SOUP. 

Boil down the half-roasted birds as directed in the foregoing receipt, 
and add to the soup, after it is strained and re-heateo, the breasts 
pounded to the finest paste with nearly as much bread soaked in a 
Bttle of the stock and pressed very dry ; for the proper manner of 
mixing them, see Potage d la Reiney (nage 29). Haifa pint of small 
mushrooms cleaned as for pickling, then sliced rather thickly, and 
stewed from ten to fifteen minutes without browning, in an ounce or 
two of fresh butter, with a slight seasoning of mace, cayenne, and 
salt, then turned into the mortar and pound^ with the other ingre- 
dients, will be found an excellent addution to the soup, which must 
be passed through a strainer after the breasts are added to it, brought 
to the point of boiling, and served with sippets d la Reine^ or with 
others simply fried of a delicate brown and well dried. We have 
occasionally had a small quantity of delicious soup made with the 
remains of birds which have been served at table; and where game 
is frequently dressed, the cook, by reserving all the fragments for the 
purpose, and combining different kinds, may often send up a goodr 
tureen of such, made at a very slight cost 



CHAP. I.] SOUPS. 85 

Pli€aa ant8,2 : stock, 5 pints : bread soaked in graTV (see Panada, 
Chapter VJJLl), nearly as much in bulk as the flesh of tne breasts of 
the birds : mnshrooms, | pint, stewed in one or two oz. of butter 10 to 
15 minutes, then pound^ with flesh of pheasants. Salt} cayenne . 
dM maoe, to season properly. 

PARTRIDGB BOUP. 

This is, we think, superior in flavour to the pheasant soup. It 
should be made in precisely the same manner, but three birds aUowed 
for it instead of two. Grouse and partridges together will make a 
still finer one ; the remaifis of roast grouse even, added to a brace of 
partridges, will produce a very good effect. 

MULLAOATAWNY SOUP. 

Slice, and fry gently in some good butter three or four large onions, 
and when they are of a fine equal amber-colour hft them out with a 
slice and put them into a deep stewpot, or large thick saucepan ; throw 
a little more butter into the pan, and then brown ligntly in it a 
young rabbit, or the prime joints of two, or a fowl cut down small, 
and floured. When the meat is sufficiently browned, lay it upon the 
onions, pour gradually to them a quart of good boiling stock, and 
stew it gently from three quarters of an hour to an hour ; then take 
it out, and pass the stock and onions through a fine sieve or strainer. 
Add to them two pints and a half more of stock, pour the whole into 
a clean pan, and when it boils stir to it two tablespoonsful of currie- 
powder nuxed with nearly as much of browned flour, and a little 
cold water or broth, put in the meat, and simmer it for twenty minutes 
or longer should it not be perfectly tender, add the juice of a small 
lemon just before it is dished, serve it very hot, and send boiled rice 
to table with it. Fart of a pickled mango cut into strips about the 
nze of large straws, is sometimes served in this soup, afler being 
stewed in it for a few minutes ; a little of the pickle itself should be 
added with it. We have given here the sort of receipt commonly 
used in England for mullagatawny, but a much finer soup may be 
made by departing from it in some respects. The onions, of which 
the proportion may be increased or diminished to the taste, afler being 
jfried slowly and with care, that no part should be overdone, may be 
stewed for an hour in the first quart of stock with three or four ounces 
of grated cocoa-nut,* which will impart a rich mellow flavour to the 
whole. After all of this that can be rubbed through the sieve has been 
added to as much more stock as will be reijuired lor the soup, and the 
corrie-powder tLod thickening have been boiled in it for twenty minutes* 

• That oar readers t^ whom this ingredient in sonps is new, may not be mifl. 
led, we must repest here, thut although the cocoa-nnt when it is young and fresh 
imparts a pteuliarlj/ rich favour to any preparation, it ia not liked by all eatersi 
and is better omitted when the taste of a party is not known, and only one soup 
Isserrod.

the fleaih of part of a calf s head,* previously stewed almost tender, and 
cut as for mock turtle, with a sweetbread also parboiled or stewed 
in broth, and divided into inch-squares, will make an admirable 
mullagatawny, if simmered in the stock imtil they have taken the 
flavour of the currie-seasoning. The flesh of a couple of calves* feH, 
with a sweetbread or two, may, when more convenient, be substituted 
for the head. A large cupful of thick cream, flrst mixed and boiled with 
a teasnoonful of flour or arrow-root to prevent its curdling, and stirred 
into tne soup before the lemon-juice, will enrich and improve it much.

mered together 20 minutes or more ; juice of lemon, 1 small ; or

Obs. 1. — The brain of the calfs head stewed for twenty minutes in 
a little of the stock, then rubbed through a sieve, diluted gradually 
with more of the stock, and added as thickening to the soup, wiU be 
found an admirable substitute for part of the flour. 

Obs, 2. — Three or four poxmds of a breast of veal, or an equal 
weight of mutton, free from bone and fat, may take the place of rab- 
bits or fowls in this soup, for a plfun dinner. The veal should be cut 
into squares of an inch and a half, or into strips of an inch in width, 
and two in length ; and the mutton should be trimmed down in the 
same way, or into very small cutlets. 

Obs. 3. — For an elegant table, the joints of rabbit or of fowl should 
always be boned before they are added to the soup, for which, in this 
case, a couple of each will be needed for a single tureen, as all the 
inferior joints must be rejected. 

TO BOIL RICE FOB MULLAGATAWNY SOUPS, OB FOR CUBBIES. 

The Fatna, or small-grained rice, which is not so good as the Caro- 
lina, for the general purposes of cookery, ought to be •served with 
cuirie. First take out the unhusked grains, then wash the rice^ in 
several waters, and put it into a large quantity of cold water ; brin^ 
it gently to boil, keeping it uncovered, and boil it softly for fifteen 
minutes, when it will be perfectly tender, and every grain will remain 
distinct. Throw it into a large cullender, and let it drain for ten 
minutes near the fire ; should it not then appear quite dry, turn it

into a dish, and set it for a short time into a gentle oren, or let it 
Bteun in a clean saucepan near the fire. It should neither he stirred, 
except just at first, to prevent its lumping while it is still quite hard, 
nor touched with either fork or spoon ; the stewpan ma^ he shaken 
occasioDAlly, should the rice seem to require it, and it should he 
thrown lightly from the cullender upon the dish. A couple of minutes 
before it is done, throw in some salt, and from the time of its begin- 
ning to boQ remove the scum as it rises.

and they have been very numerous, is mdisputably the best. Hie 
Carolina rice answers wdl dressed in the same manner, but requires 
Ibur or ^ye minutes longer boiling: it should never be served until it 
is quite tender. One or two minutes, more or less, will sometimes, 
from the vaiying quality of the grain, be requisite to render it ten-

GOOD VEGETABLE MULLAGATAWNY. 

XHssolye in a large stewpan or thick iron saucepan, four ounces 
of butter, and when it is on the point of browning, throw in four 
large mild onions sliced, three pounds weight of young vegetable 
marrow cut in large dice and cleared from the skin and seeds, four 
laige or six moderate-sized cucumbers, pared, split, and emptied 
likewise of their seeds, and from three to six large add apples, ac« 
cording to the taste ; shake the pan often, and stew these over a 
gentle fire until they are tolerably tender ; then strew lightly over 
and mix well amos^ them, three heaped tablespoonsiul of mild 
corrie powder, with nearly a third as mucn of salt, and let the vege- 
tables stew from twenty to thirty minutes longer; then pour to 
them graduaUy sufficient boiling water (broth or stock if preferred) 
to just cover them, and when they are reduced almost to a pulp press 
the whole through a h^-sieve with a wooden spoon, and neat it in a 
dean stewpan, with as much additional li<}uia as will make two 
quarts with that which was first added. Give any flavouring that 
may be needed, whether of salt, cayenne, or acid, and serve the soup 
extremely hot Should any butter appear on the surface, let it be 
earefrdly skimmed off, or stir in a smalt dessertspoonful of arrow-root 
teioothly mixed with a little cold broth or water) to absorb it. 
Kice may be served with this soup at pleasure, but as it is of the 
consistence of winter peas soup, it scarcely requires any addition. 
Tlie cnrrie powder may be altogether omitted for variety, and the 
whole converted into a plain ve^table nofa^e ; or it may be rendered 
one of hil^h savour, by browning all the vegetables lightly, and 
adding to them rich brown stock. Tomatas, when in season, may be 
sobstituted for the apples, after being divided, and forced from their 
feeds.

CUCUMBER SOUP. 

Fare, split, and empty from eight to twenty* fine, well grown, but 
not old cucumbers,— those which have the fewest seeds are best for 
the purpose ; throw a little salt over them, and leave them for an 
hour to drain, then put them with the white part only of a couple 
of mild onions into a deep stewpan or delicately clean saucepan, cover 
them nearly half an inch with pale but good veal stock, and stew 
them gently until they are penectly tender, which will be in from 
three quarters of an hour to an hour and a quarter ; work the whole 
througn a hair-sieve, and add to it as much more stock as may be 
needed to make the quantity of soup required for table ; and as the 
cucumbers, from their watery nature, will thicken it but little, stir to 
it when it boils, as much arrow-root, rice-flour, or tons let nuns (see 
page 1), as will bring it to a good consistence ; add from half to a 
whole pint of boiling cream, and serve the soup immediately. Salt 
and cayenne sufficient to season it, should be thrown over the 
cucumbers while they are stewing. The yolks of ax or eight egss^ 
mixed with a dessertspoonful of chili vinegar, may be used for this 
soup instead of cream; three dessertspoonsM of minced parsley 
may then be strewed into it a couple of minutes before they are 
added : it must not, of course, be allowed to boil after they are stirred 
in. 

SPRING SOUP AND SOUP X LA. JULIENNE. 

Throw into three quarts of strong clear broth, or shin of beef 
stock, or of coTisomme, half a pint each of turnips and carrots pre- 
pared by the directions of page 20, or turned into any other shape 
that may be preferred, with rather less of the solid part of some 
white celery stems, and of leeks or of very mild onionsf mixed. The 
latter must, if used, be sliced, drawn into rings, and divided into 
slight shreds. When these have simmered from twenty to thirty 
minutes, add the leaves of one or two lettuces and a few of sorrel, 
trimmed or torn, about the size of half-a-crown. Continue the 
eentle boiling until these are tender, and add at the moment of servin«^ 
half a pint of asparagus-points boiled very green, and as many French 
beans cut into small lozenges, and also boiled apart ; or substitute 
green peas for these last.

cheml, spinach (bofled apart, and sparingly added), green onions, 
Teiy small tufts of brocoli or cauliflower, may all be used in these 
sofops at choice. Both the kind and the proportion of the vegetables 
can be r^ulated entirely by the taste. Bi^ad stamped out with a 
very taum round cutter, and dried a pale brown in the oven, is added 
sometimea to this spring soup, but is, we should say, no improvement. 
Winter Te^etablesshomd have three or four minutes* previous boiling 
(or blanching) before they are put into the soup. 

AN EXCELLENT GREEN PEAS SOUP. 

Take at their fullest size, but before they are of bad colour or 
worm-eaten, three pints of fine large peas, and boil them as for 
table (see Chapter 'XVTL) with half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda 
in the water, that they may be very green. When they are quite 
tender, drain them well, and put them into a couple of quarts of 
boiling, pale, but good beef or veal stock, and stew them in it gently 
for hSf an hour ; then work the whole through a fine hair-sieve, 
pfut it into a clean pan and bring it to the point of boiling ; add salt, 
should it be needed, and a small teaspoonful of pounded sugar ; clear 
off the scum entirely, and serve the soup as not as possible. An 
elegant variety of it is made by addine a half pint more of stock to 
the peas, and about three quarters of a pmt of asparagus points, 
boiled apart, and well drained before they are thrown into it, which 
should be done only the instant before it is sent to table. 

Green peas, 3 pints : boiled 25 to 30 minutes, or more. Yeal or 
beef stock, 2 quarts (with peas) : | an hour. Sugar, one small tea- 
spoonful ; salt, if needed. 

Ohw. — ^When there is no stock at hand, four or five pounds of 
fllun of beef boQed slowly down with three quarts of water to two, and 
well seasoned with savoury herbs, youn^ carrots, and onions, will 
serve instead quite well. A thick slice of lean, undressed ham, or of 
Jewish bee^ would improve it. 

Should a common English peas soup be wished for, make it some- 
wrhat thinner than the one above, and add to it, just before it is 
dished, &om half to three quarters of a pint of young peas boiled 
tender and weU drained. 

GREEN PEAS SOUP^ WITHOUT MEAT. 

Boil tender in three quarts of water, with the proportions of salt 
and soda directed for them in Chapter XYII., one quart of large, full 
p^wn peas; drain, and pound them in a mortar, mix with them 
gradually five pints of the liquor in which they were cooked, put the 
whole again over the fire, and stew it gently for a quarter of an

encumbers pared and sliced, the hearts of three or four lettuces shred 
small, from one to four onions, according to the taste, cut thin, a few 
small sprigs of parsley, and, when the flavour is liked, a dozen 
leaves or more of mint roughly chopped : keep these stirred over a 
gentle fire for nearly or quite an hour, and strew over them a half- 
teaspoonM of salt, and a good seasoning of white pepper or cayenne* 
When they are partially done drain them from the butter, put them 
into the strained stock, and let the whole boil gentlv untu all the 
butter has been thrown to the surface, and been entirely cleared from 
it ; then throw in from half to three quarters of a pint of young 
peas boiled as for eating, and serve the soup immediately. 

When more convenient, the peas, with a portion of the liquor, may 
be rubbed through a sieve, instead of being crushed in a mortar ; and 
when the colour of the soup is not so much a consideration as the 
flavour, they may be slowly stewed until perfectlv tender in four 
ounces of good butter, instead of being boiled : a few green onions, 
and some branches of parsley may then be added to them. 

Green peas, 1 quart ; water, 5 pints : cucumbers, 3 to 6 ; lettuces, 
S or 4 ; onions, 1 to 4 ; little parsley ; mint (if liked^, 12 to 20 
leaves ; butter, 3 to 4 oz. ; salt, half-teasjpoonful ; seasonmg of white 
pepper or cayenne : 50 to 60 minutes. Youne peas, i to t of a pint. 

OJj.— We must repeat that the peas for these soui>s must not be 
oldj as when they are so, their fine sweet flavour is entirelv lost, and 
the dried ones would have almost as good an efiect ; nor should they 
be of inferior kinds. Freshly gathered marrowfats, taken at nearly 
or quite their full growth, will give the best quality of soup. We 
are credibly informed, but cannot assert it on our own authority, 
that it is often made for expensive tables in early spring, with tne 
youn^ tender plants or halms of the peas, when they are about a 
foot m height. They are cut off dose to the ground, like small 
salad, we are told, tnen boiled and pressed through a strainer, and 
mixed with the stock. The flavour is affirmed to be excellent 

A CHEAP GREEN PEAS SOUP. 

Wash very clean and throw into an equal quantity of boiling 
water salted as for peas, three quarts of the snells, and in from 
twenty to thirty minutes, when tfiey will be quite tender, turn the 
whole into a large strainer, and press the pods strongly with a wooden 
spoon. Measure the liquor, put two quarts of it mto a dean deep 
i^aucepan, and when it boils add to it a quart of iiill grown peas, two 
nr even three large cucumbers, as many moderate-sized lettuces 
freed from the coarser leaves and cut small, one large onion (or more 
if liked) sliced extremely thin and stewed for half an hour in a 
morsel of butter before it is added to the soup, or gently fried with- 
out being allowed to brown ; a branch or two of parsley, and, when 
the flavour is liked, a dozen leaves of mint. Stew these softly for an 
hour, with the addition of a small teaspoonful, or a larger quantity 
if required of salt, and a good seasoning of fine white pepper or ot

eayenne; then "work the whole of the Teeetables with the Bonp 
tlmragh a hair-meve, heat it afiresh, and send it to table with a dish 
of small fried sippets. The coloor will not be so brisht as that of 
the more ezpensiye soups whicl\ precede it, but it will be excellent 
in flaTOor. 

Pea-sheUs, 3 quarts ; water, 3 quarts : 20 to 30 minutes. Liquor 
from these, 2 quarts; full-sized nreen peas, 1 quart; large cucum- 
btrSf 2 or 3 ; lettuces^ 3 ; onion, 1 (or more) ; little parsley ; 
mint, 12 leaves ; seasoning of salt and pepper or cayenne : stewed 1 
hoar. 

0b9. — The cucumbers should be pared, quartered, and freed from 
the seeds before they are added to the soup. The peas, as we have 
said already more than once, should not be old, but taken at their 
full growth, before they lose their colour : the youngest of the shells 
ought to be selected for the liquor. 

RTCH PEAS SOUP. 

Soak a quart of fine yellow split peas for a night, drain them well, 
and put them into a large soup-pot with five quarts of good brown 
gravy stock ; and when they have boiled gently for half an hour, 
add to the soup three onions, as many carrots, and a turnip or two, all 
alioed and fried carefully in butter ; stew the whole sofuy until the 
peas are reduced to pulp, then add as much salt and cayenne as may 
be needed to season it well, give it two or three minutes* boil, and 
pass it through a sieve, pressing the vegetables with it. Put into a 
dean saucepan as much as may be required for table, add a little 
firesh stock to it should it be too thick, and reduce it by quick boil- 
ing if too thin ; throw in the white part of some fresh celery sliced 
a (]^uarter of an inch thick, and when this is tender send the soup 
auickly to table with a dish of small fried or toasted sippets. A 
deasertepoonful or more of currie-powder greatly improves peas 
soup : it should be smoothly mixed with a few spoonsful of it, and 
poured to the remainder when this first begins to boil after having 
been strained. 

Split peas, 1 quart : soaked one night. Good brown gravy soup, 
5 quarts: 30 minutes. Onions and carrots browned in butter, 
3 of each; turnips, 2: 2} to 3i hours. Cayenne and salt as 
needed. Soup, 5 pints; celery, sliced, 1 large or 2 small heads: 20 
minutes. 

Obi. — ^When more convenient, six pounds of neck of beef well 
scored and equally and carefully browned, may be boiled gently with 
the peas and fried v^etables in a gallon of water (which should be 
poured to them boiling) for four or five hours. 

COMMON PEAS SOUP. 

Wash well a croart of good split peas, and float off such as lemain 
on the surface of the water ; soak them for one night, and boil them

-with a bit of soda the mze of a filbert in just sufficient water to allow 
them to break to a mash. Put them into from three to four quarts 
of good beef broth, and stew them in it gently for an hour ; then 
work the whole through a sieve, heat afresh as much as may be 
required for table, season it with salt and cayenne or common pepper, 
dear it perfectly from scum, and send it to table with fried or toasted 
bread. Cele^ sliced and stewed in it as directed for the rich peas 
soup, wiQ be round a great improvement to this.

of water, 2 to 2^ hours. Bed* broth, 3 to 4 quarts: 1 hour. Salt 
and cayenne or pepper as needed : 3 minutes. 

PEAS SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

To a pint of peas, freed from all that are worm-eaten, and well 
washed, put five pints of cold water, and boil them tolerably tender ; 
then, add a couple of onions (more or less according to the taste), a 
couple of fijie carrots grated, one large or two moderate-sized 
turnips sliced, all gently fried brown in butter; half a teaspoonful 
of bliusk pepper, and three times as much of salt. Stew these softly, 
keeping uiem often stirred, until the vegetables are sufficiently tender 
to pass through a sieve ; then rub the whole through one, put it into 
a dean pan, and when it boils throw in a sliced head of celery, 
heighten the seasoning if needful, and in twenty minutes serve tne 
soup as hot as possible, with a di^ of fried or toasted bread cut into 
dice. A little chili vinegar can be added when liked : a larger pro- 
portion of vegetables also may be boiled down with the peas at plea- 
sure. Weak broth, or the liquor in which a joint has been boiled, 
can be substituted for the water; but the soup is very palatable as 
we have given the recdpt for it. Some persons like it flavoured 
with a little mushroom catsup. All peas soup is rendered more 
wholesome by the addition of a small quantity of currie-paste or 
powder. 

Split peas, 1 pint ; water, 5 pints : 2 hours or more. Onions, 2 ; 
carrots, 2 ; large turnip, 1 ; pepper, i teaspoonful ; salt, 1 J teaspoon- 
ful : 1 to 1} hour. Celery, 1 head : 20 minutes. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

An inexpensive and very nutritious soup may be made of ox-tails, 
but it will be insipid in flavour without the addition of a little ham, 
knuckle of bacon, or a pound or two of other meat. Wash and soak 
thiee tails, pour on them a gallon of cold water, let them be brought 
gradually to boil, throw in an ounce and a half of salt, and clear off 
the scum carefully as soon as it forms upon the surface ; when it 
ceases to rise, add fotir moderate-sized carrots, from two to four 
onions, according to the taste, a large faggot of savoury herbs, a head 
of celery, a couple of turnips, six or eight cloves, and a half-teaspoon- 
ful of peppercorns. Stew these gently from three hours to three and

skim off all the fat ; dii^ide we tails into joints, and put them into a 
conple of quarts or rather more of the stock ; stir in, when these 
begm to boil, a thickening of arrow-root or of rice flour (see page 4), 
nuxed with as much cayenne and salt as may be required to flavour 
the soup well, and serve it yeiy hot. If stewed down until the flesh 
&Q3 away from the bones, the ox-tails will make stock which will be 

Suite a firm ielly when cold ; and this, strained, thickened, and well 
avoured witn spices, catsup, or a little wine, would, to many tastes, 
be a superior soup to the above. A richer one still may be made by 
pouring good beef broth instead of water to the meat in the fijrst in- 
stance. 

Ox-tails, 3 ; water, 1 gallon; salt, 1) oz. ; carrots, 4 ; onions, 2 to 
4 ; turnips, 2 ; celery, 1 head ; doves, 8 ; peppercorns, i teaspoonful;

ings.)

-To increase the savour of this soup when the meat is not 
served in it, the onions, turnips, and carrots may be gently fiied until 
of a fine light brown, before tney are added to it 

▲ CHEAP AND GOOD STEW SOUP. 

Put from four to five pounds of the gristly part of the shin of beef 
into three quarts of cold water, and stew it ver^ sofUy indeed, wiUi 
the addition of the salt and vegetables directed mr hauiUon (see pa«;e 
7), until tiie whole is very tender ; lift out the meat, strain the 
l^uor, and put it into a Lurge dean saucepan, add a thickening of 
riee-flour or arrowroot, pepper and salt if needed, and a tablespoonful 
of mushroom catsup. In the mean time, cut all the meat into small, 
thick slices, add it to the soup, and serve it as soon as it is very hot. 
The thickeniiur and catsup may be omitted, and all the vegetables, 
pressed through a strainer, ma^ be stirred into the soup instead, be- 
ioxe tbe meat is put back into it. 

SOUP IN HASTE. 

Chop tolerably fine a pound of lean beef, mutton, or veal, and when 
it is putly done, add to it a small carrot and one small turnip cut in 
slices, hau an ounce of cdery, the white part of a moderate-sized 
leek, or a quarter of an ounce of onion. Mince all these together, and 
pot the whole into a deep saucepan with three pints of cold water 
When the soup boils take off the scum, and add a little salt and 
pepper. In half an hour it will be ready to serve with or without 
straining : it may be flavoured at will, with cayenne, catsup, or aught 
else that is preferred, or it ma^ be converted into French spring 
broth, by passing it through a sieve, and boiling it a^ain for five or 
■ix minuto, with a handfm of young and well washed sorrel. 

Meat, 1 lb.; carrot, 2 oz. ; turnip, 1) oz. ; celerv, J oz.; onion, i 0Z.9 
witer, 3 pinta : half an hour. Little pepper and salt. 



44 HODEBN COOKERT. [chap. x. 

Obs, — Three pounds of beef or mutton, with two or three slioes of 
ham, and vegetables in proportion to the above receipt, all chopped 
fine, and boiled in three quarts of water for an hour and a half, will 
make an excellent family soup on an emergency : additional boiling 
will of course improve it, and a little spice should be added after it 
has been skimmed and salted. It may easily be converted into carrot, 
turnip, or ground-rice soup after it is strained. 

TEAL OR MUTTON BROTH. 

To each pound of meat add a quart of cold water, biin^ it gently 
to boil, skim it very dean, add salt in the same proportion as for 
bouiUan (see page 7), .with spices and vegetables also, unless un- 
^voureabToth he required, wnen a few peppercorns, a blade or two 
of mace, and a bunch of savoury herbs, will be sufficient ; though for 
some purposes even these, with the exception of the salt, are better 
omitted. Simmer the broth for about rour hours, unless the quan- 
tity be veiy small, when from two and a half to three, will be suffi- 
cient. A Uttle rice boiled down with the meat will both thicken the 
broth, and render it more nutritious. Strain it off when done, and 
let it stand till quite cold that the fat may be entirely cleared from it: 
this is especially needful when it is to be served to an invalid. 

Veal or mutton, 4 lbs. ; water, 4 quarts ; salt. (For vegetables, &c., 
B^ page 7 ;) rice (if used), 4 oz. : 4 hours or more. 

MILK SOUP WITH VERMICELLI. 

Throw into five pints of boiling milk a small quantity of salt, and 
then drop lightly into it five ounces of good fresh vermicelli ; keep 
the milk stirred as this is added, to prevent its gathering into lumps, 
and continue to stir it very frequently from fifteen to twenty minutes, 
or until it is perfectly tender. The addition of a little pounded sugar 
and powdered cinnamon renders this a very agreeable dish. In Ca- 
tholic countries, milk soups of various kinds constantly supply the 
place of those made with meat, on maigre days ; and with us they 
are sometimes very acceptable, as giving a change of diet for the nur- 
sery or sick room. Rice, semoulma, sago, cocoa-nut, and maccaroni 
may all in turn be used for them as directed for other soups in this 
chapter, but they will be required in rather smaller proportions with 
the milk. 

Milk, 5 pints ; vermicelli, 5 oz. : 15 to 20 minutes. 

CHEAP RICE SOUP. 

Place a gallon of water on the fire (more or less according to the 
(quantity of soup require), and when it boils, throw in a moderate^ 
sized tablespoonAil of salt, and two or three onions, thickly sliced, 
a faggot or sweet herbs, a root of celery, and three or four large 
carrots split down into many divisions, and cut into short lengths. 
Boil these gently for an hour and a half, or two hours, and then stram 
the liquor from them. When time will permit, let it become cold \ 



CHAP, r.] SOUPS. 45 

thea for each quart, take from three to four ounces of well washed 
rice, pour the soup on it, heat it very slowly, giving it an occasional 
ftir, and stew it gently until it is perfectly tender, and the potage 
quite thick. A moderate seasoning of pepper, and an ounce or two 
of fresh butter well blended with a teas^nfnl of flour, may be 
thoroughly stirred up with the soup before it is served ; or, in lieu of 
the butter, the yolks of two or three new-laid eggs, mixed with a little 
milk, may be carefully added to it. 

It may be more quickly prepared by substitutmg vermicelli, semou- 
lina, or aoujee for the nee, as this last will require three ouarters of 
an hour or more of stewing after it begins to boil, and the tnree other 
ingredients— either of which must be dropped gradually into the 
Boup when it is m full ebullition — ^will be done in from twenty to 
thirty minutes ; and two ounces will thicken sufficiently a quart ot 
broth. 

A large tablespoonful of Captain Whitens currie-paste, and a small 
one of nonr, diluted with a spoonful or two or two of the broth, or 
with a little milk or cream, if perfectly mixed with the rice and stewed 
with it for fifteen or twenty minutes before it is dished, render it 
excellent : few eaters would discover that it was made without meat. 

Good beef or mutton broth can be used instead of water for the 
above soup, and in that case the vegetables sliced small, or rubbed 
through a strainer, may be added to it before it is served. 

CARROT SOUP MAIGRE. 

Throw two ounces of salt into a gallon of boiUng water, then add 
three or four carrots quartered or thickly sliced, one onion or more 
according to the taste, and a fa^^t of parsley, or some parsley roots. 
When these have boiled gently for upwards of an hour, strain off the 
liquor and put it back into the saucepan. Have ready more carrots, 
nicely scraped and washed ; split them down into strips about the 
size of large macaroni and cut them into half finger lengths. Two 
quarts of these will not be too much for persons who like the soup 
well filled with the vegetable ; boil them perfectly tender, and turn 
them with their liquor into the tureen, first addingpepper sufficient 
to season it properly, and more salt if needed. The proportion of 
carrots may be diminished, and a quart or more of Brussek sprouts, 
boiled and drained, may be substituted for part of them. Some per- 
sons lunre these soups thickened, or enriched as thev think, with flour 
and butter ; but the latter ingredient should at least be sparingly used; 
and any other kind of thickening is more wholesome. A few ounces 
of vermioelli stewed in them for twenty minutes or rather longer, will 
be found a veiy good one. Celery, leeks, and turnips may be boiled 
down in the carrot-stock, or added when the fresh vegetables have 
been stewed in it for about ten minutes.

CHEAP FISH SOUPS. 

An infinite'Tariety of excellent Bonps may be made of fish, which 
may be Btewed down for them in precisely the same manner as meat> 
and with the same addition of vegetables and herbs. When the skin 
is coarse or rank it should be carefully stripped off before the fish is 
used ; and any oily particles which may float on the snrlaoe should 
be entirely removed from it. 

In France, Jersey, Cornwall, and many other localities, the conger eel, 
vlivested of its skin, is sliced up into thick cutlets and made into soup, 
which we are assured by English families who have it often served at 
their tables, is extremely good. A half-grown fish is best for the pur- 
pose. After the soup has been strained and allowed to settle, it must 
oe heated afresh, and rice and minced parsley may be added to it as 
for the turkey soup of page 32 ; or it may be thickened with rice- 
flour only, or serv^ clear. Ciirried fish-soups, too, are much to be 
recommended. 

When broth or stock has been made as above with conger eel, 
common eels, whitings, haddocks, codling, fresh water fish, or any 
common kind, which may be at hand, flakes of cold salmon, cod fish, 
John Dories, or scallops of cold soles, plaice,* &c., maybe heated and 
served in it ; and the remains of crabs or lobsters miugled with 
them. The large oysters sold at so cheap a rate upon the 
coast, and which are not much esteemed for eating raw, serve 
admirably for imparting flavour to soup, and the softer portions of 
them may be served in it after a few minutes of gentle simmering. 
Anchovy or any other store fish-sauce may be added with good effect 
to many of these pottages if used with moderation. Ftawns and 
shrimps likewise would generally be considered an improvement to 
them. 

For more savoury preparations, fry the fish and vegetables, lay 
them into the soup-pot, and add boiling, instead of cold water to 
them. 

BUCHANAN CARROT SOUP. 

(Excellent.) 

Make two quarts of soup by either of the foregoing receipts, using 
for it good brown stock (for a common family dinner strong beef broth 
will do). Mix smoothly with a little liquid, atablespoonfulof fine cur- 
rie-powder, and boil it in the soup for ten minutes ; or instead of this, 
season it rather highly with cayenne pepper, and then stir into it from 
six ounces to half a pound of Fatna rice boiled dry and tender as for 
a currie. The whole may then remain by the side of the fire withoat 
eiircn simmering for ten minutes longer, and then be served imme- 
diately. As a ^materpotage this is generally much liked. A spoonful 
of Captain White's currie-paste will flavour it veiy agreeably if

MODERN COOKERY 



[chap. II. 



CHAPTER It 



M' 




TO CHOOSB FISH. 

The cook should be well 
acquainted with the 
signs of freshness and 
good condition in fish, as 
they are most unwhole- 
some articles of food 
when stale, and many 
of them are also dan- 
gerous eating when they 
are out of season. The 
eyes should always be 
bright, the gills of a 

^ne clear red, the body Copper Fish or Ham Kettle. 

^% the flei^ firm, yet elastic to the touch, and the smell not dia- 





nO FIBH. 49 

agreeable. When all these marks are reversed, and the ms an 
sonken, the gills very dark in hue, the fish itself flahbj and of offen- 
sive odour, it is had, and should be avoided. 
The chloride of soda, will, it is true, restore 
it to a tolerably eatable state,* if it be not 
very much over-kept, but it will never resem- 
ble in quality and whokaomeness fish which 
18 fresh from the water. 

A good turbot is thick, and fVdl fleshed, and 
the under side is of a pale cream colour or 
yellowish white ; when this is of a bluish tint, 
and the fish is thin and soft, it should be re- 
^■•'*«^'**^ jected. The same observations apply equally 
to soles. 

The best salmon and cod fish are known by a small head, very 
thick shoulders, and a small tail ; the scales of the former should be 
bright, and its flesh of a fine red colour ; to be eaten in perfection it 
should be dressed as soon as it is caught, before the cuitl (or white 
anbetance which lies between the flakes of flesh) has melted and ren- 
dered the fish oily. In that state it is really crimp, but continuea so 
only for a very few hours ; and it bears therefore a much higher price 
in the London market then, than when mellowed by having beenkept 
a dav or two. 

Tne flesh of cod fish should be white and clear before it is boiled, 
whiter still after it is boiled, and firm though tender, sweet and mild 
in flavour, and separated easily into large flakes. Many persons con- 
sider it rather improved than otherwise by having a little salt rubbed 
along the inside of the backbone and letting it lie from twenty-four to 
forty-eight hours before it is dressed. It is sometimes served crimp 
IQlc siimon, and must then be sliced as soonas it is dead, or within the 
shortest possible time afierwards. 

Herrings, mackerel, and whitings, unless newly caught, are quite 
uneatable. When they are in good condition their natural cofours 
wiU be very distinct and their whole appearance glossy and fresh. 
The herring when first taken from the water is of a silvery bright- 
ness ; the l»ck of the mackerel is of a bright green marked with £urk 
stripes ; but this becomes of a coppery colour as the fish ^ws stale. 
The whiting is of a pale brown or fawn colour with a pmkish tint ; 
bat appears dim and Icaden-hued when no louffer fresh. 

Eels should be alive and brisk in movement when they are purchased, 
tmt the ** horrid barbarity,** as it is trulv designated, of skmning and 
dividing them while they are so, is without excuse, as they are easily 
destroyed ** by piercing the sj^inal marrow close to the back part of the 
flkull with a Aarp pointed knife or skewer. If this be done in the right 

• We bare known this applied rery successfully to salmon which from some 
boors' keeping in saltry weather had acquired a slisht decree of taint, of which 
no trace remained after it was dressed ; as a general role, howevsr, fish which ia 
not whakicwiay Jrmh should he rejected for the table. 



50 MODERN COOSIEBT. [cHAP.iz. 

piBoe all motion will iiutantly cease.** We quote Dr. Eatchener*b 
aasertion on this subject ; but we know that the mode of destruction 
which he recommenos is commonly practised by the London fishmon* 
^rs. Boiling water also will immediately cause yitalitv to cease, and 
IS perhaps the most humane and ready method of destroying the 
fish. 

Lobsters, prawns, and shrimps, are very stiff when freshly boiled, 
and the tails turn strongly inwards ; when these relax, and the fish are 
soft and watery, they are stale ; and the smell will detect their being 
so, instantly, even if no other symptoms of it be remarked. If boueht 
alive, lobsters should be chosen by their weight and *' liveliness." The 
hen lobster is preferred for sauce and soups, on account of the coral ; 
but the flesh of the male is generally considered of finer flavour for 
eating. The vivacity of their leaps will show when prawns and 
shrimps are firesh from the sea. 

Oysters should close forcibly on the knife when they are opened : 
if the shells are apart ever so fittle they are losing their condition, and 
when they remain fiir open the fish are dead, and fit only to be thrown 
away. Small plump natives are very preferable to the laiger and 
coarser kinds. 

TO CLEAN FISH. 

Let this be always done with the most scrupulous nicety, for nothing 
can more effectually destrov the appetite, or disgrace the cook, than fish 
sent to table imperfectiy cleaned. Handle it lightiy, and never throw 
it roughly about, so as to bruise it ; wash it well, but do not leave it 
longer in the water than is necessary ; for fish, like meat, loses its fla- 
vour from being soaked. When the scales are to be removed, lay the 
fish flat upon its side and hold it firmly with the left hand, while they 
are scraped off with the right ; turn it, and when both sides are done, 
pour or pump sufficient water to float off all the loose scales ; then 
proceed to empty it ; and do this without opening it more than is abso^ 
lutely necessary for the purposes of cleanliness. Be sure that not the 
slightest particle of offensive matter be left in the inside ; wash out the 
blood entirely, and scrape or brush it away if needful from the back- 
bone. This may easily be accomplished without opening the fish so 
much as to render it unsightly when it is sent to table. When the 
scales are left on, the outside of the fish should be well washed and 
wiped with a coarse cloth, drawn gentiy from the head to the tai]« Eels 
to be wholesome should be skinned, but they are sometimes dressed 
without; boiling water should then be poured upon them, and they 
should be left in it from five to ten minutes before they are cut up. The 
dark skin of the sole must be stripped off when it is fried, but it 
should be left on it like that of a turbot when the fish is boiled, and it 
should be dished with the white side upwards. Whiting^ are skinned 
before thev are e^ged and crumbed for frying, but for boiling or 
broiling, the skin is left on them. The gills of all fish (the red mul- 
let sometimes excepted), must be taken out. The fins qf a turbai^ 



CHAP, il] fish. 51 

«Atcft an otmsidtred a great delicacy^ should he left vntauched; but 
thoie of most other fish most be cut off. 

TO KEEP FISH. 

We find that all the smaller kinds of fish kee]^ best if emptied and 

deaned as soon aa they are bropght in, then wiped gently as dry as 

the^ can be, and hung separately by the head on the hooks in th^ 

oeiniig of a cool larder, or in the open air when the weather will 

allow. When there is danger of their being attacked by flies, a 

wire safe, placed in a strong draught of air, is better adapted to the 

purpose. Soles in wiater will remain good for two days when thus 

prepared ; and even whitings and mackerel may be kept so without 

losing any of their excellence. Salt may be rubbed slightly over cod fish, 

and well along the back-bone ; but it injures the flavour of salmoq, 

the inside of which may be rubbed with vinegar and peppered instead* 

TVlien excessive sultriness renders all of these modes unavailing, the 

fish must at once be partially cooked to preserve it, but this should 

be avoided if possible, as it is very rarely so good when this method is 

resorted to. 

TO SWEETEN TAINTED FISH. 

The application of strong vinegar, or of acetic acid (which may be 
purchased at the chemists'), will effect this when the taint is but 
slight. The vinegar should be used pure ; and one wineglassful of 
the add should be mixed with two of water. Four either of these 
over the fish, and rub it on the parts which require it ; then leave it 
untouched for a few minutes, and wash it afterwards well, changing 
the water two or three times. When the fish is in a worse state 
the chloride of soda, from its powerful anti-putrescent properties, 
wiU have more effect : it may be diluted, ana applied in the same 
manner as the acid. 

Obs, — We have retained here the substance of the directions which 
we had given in former editions of thb book for rendenng eatable fish 
(and meat) tainted by being dosely packed or overkept ; and it is 
true that they may may be deprived of their offensive flavour and 
odour by the application of strong adds and other disinfecting agents, 
— ^Beanfoy's chloride of soda more especially — ^but we are very doubt- 
ful whether they can by any process oe converted into ttnquestionably 
wholesome food, unless from some acddental circumstance the mere 
surfiioe should be affected, or some small portion of thein, which 
could be entirely cut away. We cannot, therefore, conscientiously 
recommend the /alee economy of endangering health in preference to 
rejecting them for the table altogether. 

THE MODE OF COOKINa BEST ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT 
KINDS OF FISH. 

It is not possible, the reader will easily believe, to insert in a work 
of the size of the present volume, all the modes of dressing the many 



52 MODEBH COOKEBT. [cHAP. n. 

Taiieties of fish which aie suited to our tahles ; we giye, therefore, 
only the more essential receipts in detail, and add to them such gen- 
eral information as may, we trost, enable even a moderately in- 
telligent cook to serve all that may usually be required, without 
difficulty. 

There is no better way of dressing a good turbot, brill, John D017, 
or cod's head and shoulders, than plain but careful boiling. Salmon 
is excellent in almost every mode m which it can be cooked or used. 
Boiled entire or in crimped slices; roasted in a cradle-spit or 
Dutch oven ; baked ; fried in snudl collops ; collared ; potted ; 
dried and smoked; pickled or soused (this is die coarsest and 
least to be recommended process for it, of any^; made into a 
raised or common pie, or a potato-pasty ; served cold in or with sa- 
voury jelly, or with a MayotmoMe sauce ; or laid on potatoes and 
baked, as in Ireland, it will be found Good. 

Soles may be either boiled, or baked, or fHed entire, or in fillets ; 
curried; stewed in cream; or prepared by any of the directions 
given for them in the body of this chapter. 

Plaice, unless when in Ml season and very ftesh, is apt to be 
watery and insipid; but taken in its perfection and carefully cooked, 
it is very sweet and delicate in flavour. If large, it may be boiled 
with advantage either whole or in fillets ; but to many tastes it is 
very superior when filleted, dipped into esg aad bread crumbs, and 
fried. The flesh may also be curried ; or tiie plaice may be converted 
into water-souchy, or saupe'tnaigre : when small it is often fried 
whole. 

Bed mullet should always be hdked^ hroUed^ or roasted: it should 
on no occasion be boiled. 

Mackerel, for which many receipts will be found in this chapter, 
when hTOTledgttite whole, as we have directed, or freed from the bones, 
divided, eggeo, crumbed, and fried, is infinitely superior to the same 
fish cooked in the ordinary manner. 

The whiting, when vert/ fresh and in season, is alwajrs delicate and 
good ; and of all fish is considered the best suited to mvalids. Per- 
haps ^wUe the most wholesome mode of preparing it for them, is to 
open it as little as possible when it is cleansed, to leave the skin on, 
to dry the fish well, and to broil it gently. It should be sent very 
hot to table, and will require no sauce : twenty minutes will usually 
be required to cook it, if of moderate size. 

The haddock is sometimes very large. We have had it occaaonall^ 
from our southern coast between two and three feet in length, and it 
was then remarkably good when simply boiled, even the day after it 
was caught, the white curd between the flakes of flesh being like that 
of extremely fresh salmon. As it is in full season in mid- winter, it can 
be sent to a distance without injury. It is a very firm fish when 
large and in season ; but, as purchased commonly at inland markets, 
is often neither fine in size nor quality. One of the best modes of 
cooking it is, to take tiie flesh entire from the bones, to divide it, dip 



eBAT. zl] fish. 58 

it into egg and bread-crumba, mixed with wroruj herhB finely 
mineed, and a seasoninff of salt and spice, and to fry it like soles. 
Other receipts for it will be foond in the body of this chapter. 

The fiesh of the gurnard is exceedingly dry, and somewhat aver 
fam^ but when filled with well-made forcemeat and gently baked, it 
is mnch liked by many persons. At good tables, it is often served in 
fillets fried or baked, and richly sauced : in common cookery it is 
aometimes boUed. 

Portions only of the skate, which is frequently of enormous si2e, are 
used as food : these are in general cut out by the fisherman or by the 
salfwman, and are called 3ie wings. The flesh is commonly served 
here divided into long narrow fillets, called crimped skate, which are 
rolled up and fastened^ to preserve them in that form, while they are 
eooked. In France, it is sent to table raised from the bones in large 
portiona, sauced with beurre-noir (hurned or browned butter), and 
strewed with well-crisped parsley. 

Trout, which is a delicions fish when stewed in gravy, either quite 
simply, or with the addition of wine and various condiments, and 
^hich when of small size is very sweet and pleasant, eating nicely 
filed, 18 poor and insipid when plainly boiled.* 

Pike, of which the flesh is extremely dry, is we think better baked 
than dressed in any other way ; but it is often boiled. 

Carp should either be stewed whole in the same manner as trout, 
or served cut in slices, in a rich sauce called a matelote. 

Smelta, sand-eels, and white-bait, are always fried ; the last two 
gnmetimea after being dipped into batter. 

THE BEST MODE OF BOILING FISH. 

We have left unaltered in the following receipts the greater number 
of our original directions for boiling fish, which were found when care- 
fully followed, to produce a good result ; but Baron Liebeg and other 
scientific writers explain deany the principles on which the nutriment 
contained in fish or fiesh is best retained by bringing the surface of 
either when it is cooked, into immediate contact with boiling water ; 
and then (after a few minutes of ebullition) lowering the temperature 
by the addition of cold water, and keeping it somewhat below the 
boiling point for the remainder of the process. This method is at 
least worthy of a trial, even if it be attended with a slight degree 
more of trouble than those in general use ; but when fish is served 
with a variety of other dishes, the escape of some portion of its 
nutritious juices is of less importance than when it forms the principal 
food of any part of the community : in that case, the preservation of 

• We hare been informed by Mr. Howitt, the ivell-knoTm author of seTeral 
highly interestmg works on Germany, that this fish, when boiled the instant it 
was ean^tr—ss he had eaten it often on the banks of some celebrated German 
troai'StTeams — ^was most ezceUant, especiallY when it was of large size ; bat, as a 
general rok^ afanost say other mods of codcing is to be reoommended fiv it in

all the nourishment which can he derired from it, is of real conse- 
quence. 

Directions. — Throw into as much water as will cover the fish 
entirely, a portion of the salt which is to he added in cooking it, and 
when it boils quickly take off the scum, lay in the fish, and let it 
boil moderately fast from three to ten minutes, according to its weight 
and thickness ; then pour in as much cold water as there is of the 
boiling, take out a part, leaving sufficient only to keep the fish well 
covered until it is ready to serve ; add the remainder of the salt, 
draw the fish-kettle to the side of the fire, and keep the water ji»^ 
simmering, and no more, imtil the fish is done. 

The cook will understand that if a gallon of water be required to 
cover the fish while it is cooking, that quantity must be made to boil ; 
and that a gallon of cold must be added to it after the fish has been 
laid in, ana kept boiling for a very few minutes. For example : — ^A 
large turbot or cod's head for ten minutes ; a moderate-sixed plaice 
or John Dory, about five ; and whitings, codlings, and other small 
fish, from three to four minutes. That one geJlon must then be 
taken out of the kettle, which should immediately be drawn from the 
^e, and placed at the side of the stove, that the fish may be gra- 
dually heated through as the water is brought slowly to the point of 
simmering. 

The whole of the salt may be added after a portion of the water is 
withdrawn, when the cook cannot entirely depend on her own judg- 
ment for the precise quantity required. 

Obs. — This is the best practical application that we can give of 
Baron Liebeg*s instructions. 

BRINE FOR BOILING FISH. 

Fish is exceedingly insipid if sufficient salt be not mixed with the 
water in which it is boiled, but the precise quantity required for it will 
depend, in some measure, upon the kind of salt which is used. Fine 
common salt is that for which our directions are given ; but when the 
Maldon salt, which is very superior in strength, as well as in other 
qualities, is substituted for it, a smaller quantity must be allowed 
About four ounces to the gallon of water will be sufficient for small 
fish in general ; an additiomd ounce, or rather more, will not be too 
much for cod fish, lobsters, crabs, prawns, and shrimps ; and salmon 
will require eight ounces, as the brine for this fish should be strong: 
the water should .always be perfectly well skimmed from the moment 
the scum begins to form upon the surface. 

Mackerel, whiting, and other small fish, 4 ounces of salt to a gallon 
of water. Cod fisn, lobsters, crabs, prawns, shrimps, 5 to 6 os. 
Salmon, 8 ozs. 

TO RENDER BOILED FISH FIRM. 

Put a small bit of saltpetre with the salt into the water in which It 
is boiled : a quarter of an ounce wiU be sufficient for a gallon*

FISH. 55 



TO KNOW WHEN FISH 18 SUFFICIENTLY BOILED^ OB OTHERWI8B 

COOKED. 

If the Sickest part of the flesh separates easily fh>m the back -bone, 
It is quite ready to serve, and should be withdrawn irom the pan 
without delay, as further cooking would be iigurious to it. This test 
can easily be applied to a fish which Jias been divided, but when it is 
entire it shoula oe lifted from the water when the flesh of the tail 
hieaks firom the bone» and the eyes loosen firom the head. 

TO BAKB FISH. 

A gentle oven may be used with advantage, for cooking almost 
eveiy kind of fish, as we have ascertained from our own observation ; 
but it must be subjected to a mild d^pree of heat on]y. This pene- 
irates the fl^ gradually, and converts it into wholesome succulent 
food ; whereas, a hot oven evaporates all the juices rapidly, and 
renders the fish hard and dry. When small, thev should he wrapped 
in oiled or buttered paper before they are baked ; and when filleted, 
or left in any other form, and placed m a deep dish with or without 
any liquid before they are put into the oven, a, buttered paper should 
still be laid closely upon tnemtokeepthe surface moist. Large pieces 
cf salmon, conger eel, and other fish of considerable size are some- 
times in common cookery baked like meat over potatoes pared and 
halved. 

FAT FOR FRTINa FISH. 

This, whether it be butter, lard, or oil should always be excellent 
in qxialitv, for the finest fish will be rendered unfit for eating if it be 
&ied in iat that is rancid. When good, and used in sufilcient quan- 
tity, it will serve for the same purpose several times, if strained after 
each frying, and put carefully away in a clean pan, provided always 
that it has not been smoked nor burned in the using. 

Lard renders fish more crisp than butter does; but fresh, pure 
oHve-oil (salad oUjOsitis commonly called in England) is the best' 
ingredient which can be used for it, and as it will serve well for the 
same purpose, manv times in succession, if strained and carefully 
stored as we have already stated, it is not in reality so expensive as 
might be supposed for this mode of cooking. There should alwavs 
be an ample quantity of it (or of any other /ritere*) in the pan, as the 
fish shouM be nearly covered with it, at the least ; and it should cease 
to bubble before either Mi or meat is laid into it, or it will be too 
much absorbed by the flesh, and will iiapart neither suficient firm- 
t nor suflident colour.

TO KEEP FISn HOT FOB TABLE. 

Never leave it in the water after it is done, but if it cannot be sent 
to table as soon as it is ready to serve, lift it out, lay the fish-plate 
into a large and very hot dish, and set it across the fish-kettle ; just 
dip a clean cloth into the boiling water, and spread it upon the ti^, 
place a tin cover over it and let it remain so until two or three 
minutes before it is wanted, then remove the cloth, and put the fidi 
back into the kettle for an instant that it may be as hot as possible : 
drain, dish, and serve it immediately: the water should be kept boil- 
ing the whole time. 

TO BOIL A TURBOT. 

[In season all the year.] 

♦ A fine turbot, in full season, and 

well served, is one of the most delicate 
and delicious fish that can be sent to 
table ; but it is generally an expen- 
sive dish, and its excellence so much 
depends on the manner in which it is 
dressed, that great care should be 
taken to prepare it properlv. After 
it is emptied, wash tne inside until it 
.po^i^^ is perfectly cleansed, and rub lightly a 

little fine salt over the outside, as 
this will render less washinfl^ and handling necessary, by at once tak- 
ing off the slime; chan^ the water sevexul times, and when the fish 
is as clean as it is possible to render it, draw a sharp knife through 
the thickest part of the middle of the back nearly through to the 
bone.* Never cut off the fm of a turbot when preparing it lor table, 
and remember that it is the dark side of the fish in which the incision 
is to be made, to prevent the skin of the white side from cracking 
Dissolve in a well-cleaned turbot or common fish-kettle, in as mud^ 
cold spring water as will cover the fish abundantly, salt, in the pro- 
portion offour ounces to the gallon ; vdpe the fish-plate with a dean 
cloth, lay the turbot upon it with the white side upwards, place it in 
the kettle, bring it slowly to boil, and clear off the scum thoroughhj 
as it rises. Let the water onl^ just simmer tuitil the fish is done, 
then lift it out, drain, and slide it ^ntly on to a ver^r hot dish, with a 
hot napkin neatly arranged over the drainer. Send it immediately to 
table with rich lobster sauce and good plain melted butter. For a 
simple dinner, anchovy or shrimp sauce is sometimes served with 
a small turbot Shoicdd there be any cracks in the skin of the fish^ 

* This is the common practice even of the "bui ofoka, bat is veiy nnadentifio 
nerertheleas. When the incision is made reallj intc the flesh the tnrboi should 
be cooked altogether on Liebeg's plan, for which see ' The Best Mode of Boiling

bmehes of cnrled panley may be laid lightly over them, or part of 
^e inside ooral of a lobster, rubbed through a fine haLr-neyei may be 
sprinkled over the fish ; but it is better wiuiout either, when it is yeiy 
white and unbroken. When gamishings are in favour, a slioe of 
lemon and a tuft of curled parsley, may be placed alternately round 
the edge of the dish. A border of fried smelts or of fillets of soles, 
was fennerly served round a turbot, and is always a veiy admissible 
addition, though no longjer so fiuhionable as it was. From fifteen to 
twenty minutes will boil a moderate-sized fish, and from twenty to 
thirty a larse one ; but as the same time will not always be sufficient 
for a fish of the same weight, the cook must watch it attentively, aod 
Itft it out as soon as its appearance denotes its being done. 

Moderate siaed tnrbot, 15 to 20 minnt^ Large, 20 to 80 mJTiwtef- 
Looser, if of unusual size 

Om. — ^A lemon ^pentlv squeezed, and rubbed over the fish, is 
thought to preserve its whiteness. Some good cooks still put turbot 
into JHriUag water, and to prevent its breaking, tie it with a doth 
tightly to the fish-plate. 

TURBOT 1 LA Cld^ME. 

Baiae earefhUy firom the bones the flesh of a cold turbot, and dear 
it from the dark skin ; cut it into small squares, and put it into an 
exceedingly dean stewpan or saucepan ; then make and pour upon it 
the cream sauce of Chapter Y., or make as much as may be required 
for the fish b^ the same recdpt, with equal proportions df milk and 
cream and a bttle additional flour. Heat the turbot slowly in the sauce, 
but do not allow it to boil, and send it very hot to table. The white 
skin of the fish is not usually added to this dish, and it is of better ap- 
pearance without it; but for a &mily dinner, it may be left on the 
neah, when it is mudi liked. No add must be stirred to the sauce 
until the whole is ready for table. 



TURBOT AU BECHAMEL, OR, IN BECHAMEL SAUCE. 

Prepare the cold turbot as for the preceding receipt, but leave no 
portion of the skin with it. Heat it in a rich bechamel sauce, and 
serve it in a vcl-au-ventt or in a deep djsh vrith a border of fried bread 
cut in an elegant form, and made with one dark and one light sippet, 
placed alternately. The surface may be covered with a half-inch 
Liyer of delicatdy fried bread-crumbs, perfecti^ well drained ana

then moistened with clarified butter, and browned with a sala-

TO BOIL A JOHN DORY. 
£ln best eaaBon from Michaelmafi to Christmas, but good all the year.] 

The John D017, though of nniuvit- 
ing appearance, is considered hy some 
persons as the most delicious fish that 
appears at tahle ; in the general esti- 
mation, however, it ranks next to the 
turbot, but it is far less abundant in 
our markets, and is not commonly 
to be procured of sufficient size for 
a handsome dish, except in some few 
^ parts of our coast which are cele- 

i,-h.i n.irv 7 brated for it. It may easily be 

known by its yellow gray colour, its one large dark spot on either 
side, the long nlaments on the back, a general mickness of form, and 
its very ugly head. It is dressed in the same manner, and served 
usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to 
boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked. 

SMALL JOHN DORIES BAKED. 

(Author's Receipt— good,) 

We have found these fish when they were too small to be worth 
cooking in the usual way, excellent when quite simply baked in the 
following manner, the flesh being remarkably sweet and tender, much 
more so than it becomes by frying or broiling. After they have 
been cleaned, dry them in a cloth, season the insides slightly with 
fine salt, dredge a little flour on the fish, and stick a few very small 
bits of butter on them, but only just sufficient to prevent their 
becoming dry in the oven ; lay them singly on a flat dish, and bake 
them very gently from fourteen to sixteen minutes. Serve them 
with the same sauce as baked soles. 

When extremely fresh, as it usually is in the markets of the coast, 
fish thus simply dressed aufour is preferable to that more elaborately 
prepared by adding various condiments to it after it is placed in a 
deep dish, and covering it with a thick layer of bread crumbs, mois- 
tened vrith clarified butter. 

The appearance of the John Dories is improved by taking off the 
heads, and cutting away not only the fins but the filaments of the 
back. 

TO BOIL A BRILL. 

A fresh and full-8i2ed brill always ranks high in the list offish, as 
it is of good appearance, and the flesh is sweet and delicate. It re- 
quires less cookmg than the turbot, even when it is of equal size; 
but otherwise may be dressed and served in a similar manner. It has 
not the same rich glutinous skin as that fish, nor are th« fins esteemed. 



CHA7. U.] FISH. 59 

They nniBt be cot off when the brill is cleaned ; and it may be put 
into nearly boiling water, unless it be very larse. Simmer it ^ntly, 
and drain it well upon the fish-plate when it is lifted out ; didi it on a 
napkin, and send lobster, anchoyy, crab, or shrimp sauce to table 
with it. Lobster coral, rubbed through a sieve, is commonly 
sprinkled oyer it for a formal dinner. The most usual garnish for 
boiled fiat fish is curled j^arsley placed round it in light tufts ; how 
&r it is appropriate^ individual taste must decide. 

Brill, moderate- sized, about 20 minutes ; laige, 30 minutes. 

Ohf. — ^The precise time which a fish will reouire to be boiled cannot 
be given : it must be watched, and not allowed to remain in the water 
after it begins to crack. 

TO BOIL 8ALM0K. 

[In faJl season ftom May to Angnst: maj be had much eariier, bat is soaroe 

and dear.] 

To preserve the fine colour of this fish, and to set the curd when it 
^ quite freshly caught, it is usual to put it into boiling ^ instead of into 
cold water. Scale, empty, and wash it with the greatest nicety, and 
be especially careful to cleanse all the blood from the inside. Stir 
into tne fish-kettle eight ounces of common salt to the gallon of water, 
let it boQ quickly for a minute or two, take off all the scum, put in 
the salmon and boil it moderately fast, if it be small, but more ^ntly 
ahonld it be very thick ; and assure yourself that it is quite sufficiently 
done before it is sent to table, for nothing can be more distasteful, 
even to the eye, than fish which is under dressed. 

From two to three poimds of the thick part of a fine salmon will 
require half an hour to boil it, but eight or ten- pounds will be done 
enoucb in little more than double that time ; less in proportion to its 
weight should be allowed for a small fish, or for the thin end of a 
laige-one. Do not allow the salmon to remain in the water after it ia 
ready to serve, or both its fiavour and appearance will be injured. 
Dish it on a hot napkin, and send dressed cucumber, and anchovy, 
idirimp, or lobster sauce, and a tureen of plain melted butter to table 
with it 

To each gallon water, 8 oz. salt Salmon, 2 to 3 lbs. (thick), 
I hour ; 8 to 10 lbs., li hour ; small, or thin fish, less time. 

SALMON 1 LA GENEVESE. 

A fashionable mode of serving salmon at the present day is to 
divide the larger portion of the body into three equal parts ; to bolL 
them in water, or in a marinade ; and to serve them di»ied in a line, 
but not dose together, and covered with a rich Genevese sauce (for 
which see Chapter Y.) It app^urs to us that the skin should be 
stripped from any fish over which the sauce is poured, but in this 
ease it is not eustcnnary.

CRIMPED SALMON. 

Cat into slices an inch and a half, or two inches thick, the hody of 
a salmon quite newly caught; throw them into strong salt and water 
as they are done, hut do not let them soak in it ; wash them well, 
lay them on a fish-plate, and put them into &Bt hoiling water, saltei^ 
and well skimmed. In from ten to fifteen minutes they will be done. 
Dish them on a napkin, and send them very hot to table witb.

of Chapter Y. The water should be salted as for saunon boiled in.

SAUtON 1 LA ST. marcel: 

Separate some cold boiled salmon into flakes, and free them en*

it is very hot, dish and send it quickly to table. French cooks, when 
they re-dress fish or meat of any kind, prepare the flesh vdth great 
nicety, and then put it into a stewpan, and pour the sauce upon it, 
which is, we think, better than tne more usual English mode of 
layinff it into the boiling sauce. The cold salmon may also be re- 
heated in the cream sauce of Chapter Y., or in the Mditre ^ Hotel 
sauce which follows it; and will be found excellent with either. 
This receipt is for a moderate sized dish. 

SALMON baked OYER MASHED POTATOES. 

We are informed by a person who has been a resident in Ireland, 
that the middle of a salmon is there often baked over mashed, 
potatoes, from which it is raised by means of a wire stand, as meat Is 
m England. We have not been able to have it tried, but an in- 
genious cook will be at no loss for the proper method of preparing, 
and the time of cooking it. The potatoes are sometimes pierely pared 
and halved ; the fish is then laid upon them.

Llnlogfaest setson ftom October to the beginning of Febmsiy; in pexfectioa

When this fish is large the head and shoulders are sufficient for m 
handsome dish, and they contain all the choicer portion of it, though 
not so much substantial eating as the middle of the body, which, m 
consequence, is generally preferred to them by the frugal house- 
keeper. Wash tae fish, and cleanse the inside, and the back-bone in 
particular, with the most scrupulous care ; lay it into the fish-kettle 
and cover it well with cold water mixed with five ounces of salt to

Place it over a moderate fire, clear off the scum perfectly, and let the 
fish boil gently until it is done. Drain it well* and disn it carefully 
upon a veiy hot napkin with the liver and the roe as a garnish. To 
tbtte are usually added tufts of lightly scraped horse-radish round 
the edge. Serve well-made 03r8ter sauce and plain melted butter 
with it ; or anchovy sauce, when oysters cannot be procured. The 
cream sauce of Chapter Y ., is also an appropriate one for this fish. 

Moderate size, 20 to 30 minutes. Large, f to { hour. 

SLICES OF COB FI8H FIIIED» 

Cut the middle or tail of the fish into slices nearly an inch thick, 
season them with salt and white pepper or cayenne, flour them well, 
and fry them of a clear equal brown on both sides ; drain them on a 
sieve before the fire, and serve them on a well-heated napkin, with 
plenty of crisped parsley round them. Or, dip them into beaten 
egg^ and then into fine crumbs mixed with a seasoning of salt and 
pepper (some cooks add one of minced herbs also), before they are 
friea. Send melted butter and anchovy sauce to table with them. 

8 to 12 minutes. 

C?d#.— This is a much better way of dressing the thin part of the 
fish than boiling it, and as it is generally cheap, it makes thus an

STEWED COD. 

Put into boiling water, salted as usual, about three poundei of fresh 
cod fish cut into slices an inch and a half thick, and boil them 
gently for five minutes ; lift them out, and let them drain. Have 
ready heated in a wide stewnan nearly a pint of veal fn.Yy or of 
yery good broth, lay in the nsh, and stew it for five mmutes, then 
add four tablespoonsM of extremely fine bread-crumbs, and simmer 
it for three minutes longer. Stir well into the sauce a large tea- 
spoonful of arrow-root quite free from lumps, a fourth part as much 
of mace, something less of cayenne, and a tablesjpoonful of essence of 
anchovies, mixed vrith a glass of white wine and a dessertspoonful of 
lemon juice. Boil the whole for a couple of minutes, lift out the fi^ 
carefully with a slice, pour the sauce over, and serve it quickly. 

Cod mh, 3 lbs. : boiled 5 minutes. Gravy, or strong broth, nearly 
1 pint: 5 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 4 tablespoonsful : 3 minutes. 
Arrow-root, 1 large teaspoonful; mace, i teaspoonful; less of 
cayenne; essence of anchovies, 1 tablespoonf ul ; lemon-juice, 1 
dessertspoonful ; sherry or Maidera, 1 wineglassful : 2 minutes. 

Obs. — A dozen or two of oysters, bearded, and added with their 
strnined liquor to this dish two or three minutes before it is served,^ 
will to many tastes vary it very agreeably. 

STEWED COD FISH, IN BROWN SAUCE. 

Slice the fish, take off the skin, flour it well, and fry it quickly a 
fine brown ; lift it out and drain it on the back of a sieve, arrange 
it in a clean stewpan, and pour in as much good boiling brown gravy 
as will nearly cover it ; aidd &om one to two glasses of port wine, 
or rather more of claret, a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar, or the 
juice of half a lemon, and some cayenne, with as much salt as may be 
needed. Stew the fish very softly until it just begins to break, lift it 
carefully with a slice into a verv hot dish, stir into the gravy an 
ounce and a half of butter smoothly kneaded with a large teaspoonful 
of flour, and a little pounded mace, give the sauce a minute's boil, 
pour it over the fish, and serve it immediately. The wine may be 
omitted, good shin of beef stock substituted for the gravy, and a tea- 
spoonful of soy, one of essence of anchovies, and two tablespoonsful 
of Harvey*s sauce added to flavour it. 

TO BOIL SALT FISH. 

AVhen very salt and dry, this must be long soaked before it is 
boiled, but it is generally supplied by the fishmongers nearly or quite

TO FRY SOLES. 
[In sasBon all the year.] 

All fish to fry well must be not only fresh bat perfectly firee from 
moisture, particularly when they are to be dressed with egg and 
bread-crumbs, as these will not otherwise adhere to them. Empty, 
skin, and wash the soles with extreme nicety, from one to two hours 
before they are wanted for table ; and after having cleansed and wiped 
them very dry both inside and out, replace the roes, fold and press 
them gently in a soft clean cloth, and ieave them wrapped in it until 
it is time to fry them ; or suspend them singly upon hooks in a current 
of cool air, which is, perhaps, the better method of proceeding when 
it can be done conyemently. Cover them equally in every part, first 
with some beaten ^g, and then with fine dry crumbs of bread, mixed 
with a very little £>ur to make them adhere with more certsdnty : a 
small teaspoonful will be sufficient for two large soles. Melt in a 
large and exceedingly dean frying pan over a brisk and clear fire, as 
much very pure-flavoured lard as will float the fish, and let it be sufli- 
dently hot before they are laid in to brown them quickly; for if 
this he neglected it will be impossible to render them crisp or dry. 
When the fiit ceases to bubble, throw in a small bit of bread, and 
if it takes a good colour immediately the soles may be put in wiUiout 
delay. An experienced cook will know, vdthout this test, when it is 
at the proper point ; but the learner will do better to avail herself of 
it until practice and observation shall have rendered it unnecessary to 
her. Before the fish are laid into the pan, take them by the head 
and shake the loose crumbs from them. When they are firm, and 
of a fine amber-colour on one side, turn them with care, passing a 
slice under them and a fork through the heads, and brown them on 
the other. Lift them out, and either dry them well on a soft cloth 
laid upon a sieve reversed, before the fire, turning them often, or 
press them lightly in hot white blotting paper. Dish them on a 
drainer covered vdth a hot napkin and send them to table without 
delay with shrimp or anchovy sauce, and plain melted butter. 

Very small soles will be done in six minutes, and large ones in 
about ten. They may be floured and ftied, without being ^ged and 
crumbed, but this is not a very usual mode of serving them. 

Small soles, 6 minutes ; large, about 10 minutes. 

TO BOIL SOLES. 

The flesh of a fine fresh sole, when bolted with care, is remarkably 
sweet and delicate : if very lai^gje it may be dressed and served as turbot, 
to which it will be fou ad little inferior in flavour. Empty it, take out 
the gills, cut off the fins, and cleanse and wash it with ^reat nicety, 
but do not skin it ; then either lay it into cold water in which the usual 
proportion of salt has been dissolved, and beat it rather slowly, and 
then simmer it from five to ten minutes, according to its sise ; or boil

well on the fish-plate as it is lifted out, and dish it on a napkin^ the 
white side upwards, and serve it quickly with anchovy, shrimp, or 
lobator sance. It may also be sent to table thickly covered with the 
Cream Fish Sauce, Caper Fish Sauce, or Lady*8 Sauce, of Chapter VI. ; 
though this is a mode of service less to be recommended, as the sauce 
cools more speedily when spread over the surface of the fish : it is, 
however, the continental fasnion, and will therefore find more favour 
with some persons. 

Very large sole, 5 to 10 minutes ; moderate sized, 4 to 6 
minutes. 

FILLETS OF SOLES. 

The word fiBet^ whether applied to fish, poultry, game, or butcher s 
meat, means simply the flesh of either (or of certain portions of it), 
raised clear from the bones in a handsome form, and divided or not, 
as the manner in which it is to be served may require. It is an 
elegant mode of dressing various kinds of fish, and even those which 
are not the most highly esteemed, afford an excellent dish when thus 
prepared. Soles to be filletted with advantage should be large ; the 
flesn may then be divided down the middle of the back, next, sepa- 
rated from the fins, and with a very sharp knife raised clear from the 
bones.* When thus prepared, the fillets may be divided, trimmed 
into a good form, egg^ covered with fine crumbs, fried in the usual 
way, and served with the same sauces as the whole fish ; or each fillet 
may be rolled up, in its entire length, if very small, or after being 
onee divided if large, and fastened with a slight twine, or a short thin 
skewer ; then egg^, crumbed, and fried in plenty of boiling lard ; or 
merely well floured and fried from eight to ten minutes. When the 
fish are not very large, they are sometimes boned without being 
parted in the middle, and each side is rolled from the tail to the head, 
after being first spread with pounded shrimps mixed with a third of 
their volume of butter, a few bread-crumbs, and a high seasoning of 
mace and cayenne ; or with pounded lobster mixed with a large por- 
tion of the coral, and the same seasoning, and proportion of butter as 
the riirimps ; then laid into a dish, with the mgredients directed for 
the soles au plat; well covered with crumbs of bread and clarified 
batter, and baked from twelve to sixteen minutes, or until the crumbs 
are coloured to a fine brown in a moderate oven. 

The fillets may likewise be cut into small strips or squares of uni- 
form size, lightly dredged with pepper or cayenne, salt and flour, and 
fried in butter over a brisk fire ; then well drained, and sauced with 
a good beehamel, flavoured with a teaspoonful of minced parsley. 

• A eeklmted French cook gires the following instructions for raising these 
fillets : — ** Take them up hj running your knife first between the bones and Uie 
fle*h, then between the akin and the fillet ; hj leaning pretty hard on the tabls 
ihcy viQ come off lerj nesUy."

SOLES AU PLAT. 

Clarifjr from two to three ounces of fresh butter, and pour it into 
the dish in which the fish are to be served ; add to it a little salt, some 
cayenne, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, and from one to two 
glasses of sherry, or of any other dry while wine ; lay in a couple of 
fine soles which have been well cleaned and wiped very dry, strew 
over them a thick layer of fine bread-crumbs, moisten them with 
clarified butter, set the dish into a moderate oven, and bake the fish 
for a quarter of an hour. A layer of shrimps placed between the 
soles is a great improvement ; and we would also recommend a litUe 
lemon-juice to be mixed with the sauce.

Obs. — The soles are, we think, better without the wine in this 
receipt. They reouire but a small portion of liauid, which might be 
supplied by a little additional butter, a spoonrul of water or pale 
gravy, the lemon-juice, and store-sauce. Minced parsley may be 
mixed ydth the bread-crumbs when it is liked.

Fresh large soles, dressed in the follovnng manner, are remarkably 
tender and delicate eating ; much more so than those which are friea. 
Aiter the fish has been skinned and cleansed in the usual way, wipe it 
dry, and let it remain for an hour or more, if time will permit, closely 
folded in a clean cloth ; then mix with a slightly beaten egg about an 
ounce of butter, just liquefied but not heated at the mouth of the 
oven, or before the fire ; brush the fish in every part vrith this mix-

moderate oven for about twenty minutes. If two or more soles are 
required for table at the same time, they should be placed separately, 
quite flat, in a large dish, or each fish should be laid on a dish by 
itself. On our first essay of this receipt, the fish dressed by it (it was 
baked for twenty-five minutes in a very slack iron oven) proved in- 
finitely nicer than one of the same size which was fried, and served 
with it. The difference between them was very marked, especially 
as regarded the exceeding tenderness of the flesh of that which was 
baked; its appearance, however, would have been somewhat im- 
proved by a rather quicker oven. When ready to serve, it should 
be gentlv glided on to the dish in which it is to be sent to table. 
About three ounces of bread-crumbs, and two and a half of butter,

other fish as well, into cold water when they are to be boiled ; for- 
merly all were plunged at once into fast-boiling water. For such as 
are small and delicate, it should be hot ; they should be brought 
gently to boil, and simmered until they are done ; the scum should 
be cleared off as it rises, and the usual proportion of saJt stirred into 
the water before the mackerel are put in. The roes are commonly 
replaced in the fish ; but as they sometimes require more boiling than 
the mackerel themselves, it is better, when they are very large, to 
lay them upon the fish-plate by their sides. From fifteen to twenty 
minutes wul generally be sufficient to boil a full -sized mackerel

bits of butter upon them ; or pour some equally over them, after 
having just dissmved it in a smsdl saucepan. Half an hour in a mo- 
derate oven will bake them. Oyster forcemeat is always appropriate 
for any kind of fish which is in season while the oysters are so ; but the 
mackerel are commonly served, and are very good with that which A/e 
have named. Lift them carefully into a hot &h after they are taken

BAEBD MACKEREL, OR WHITmGS. 

{CindereJMs Receipt— good,) 

The fish for this receipt should be opened only so much as will 
permit of their beinjz emptied and perfectly cleansed. Wash and 
"wipe them dry, then told them in a soft cloth, and let them remain in 
it awhile. Bieplace the roes, and put the fish into a bakinc^-dish of 
suitable size, with a tablespoonful of wine, a few drops of cnili vine- 
gar, a little salt and cayenne, and about half an ounce of butter, well- 
blended with a saltspoonful of flour, for each fish. They must be 
turned round with tne heads and tails towards each other, that they 
may lie compactly in the dish, and the backs should be placed down- 
wards, that the sauce may surround the thickest part of the flesh. 
Lay two buttered papers over, and press them down upon them ; set 
the dish into a sentle oven for twenty minutes, take off the papers, 
and send the fisn to table in their sauce. 

A few minutes more of time must be allowed for mackerel when it 
is larffe, should the oven be very slow. 

Full-sized whitings are excellent thus dressed if carefully managed, 
and many eaters would infinitely prefer mackerel so prepared, to 
boiled ones. The writer has port-wme always used for tne sauce, to 
which a rather full seasoning of chili vinegar, cayenne, and pounded 
mace, is added ; but sherry, Bucellas, or any other dry wine, can be 
used instead ; and the various condiments added to it, can be varied 
to the taste. This receipt is a very convenient one, as it is prepared 
with little trouble, and a stove-oven, if the heat be properly mode- 
'rated, will answer for the baking. It is an advantage to take off 
the heads of the fish before they are dressed, and thev mav then be 
entirely emptied without beinff opened. When preferred so, they 
can be re-dished for table, and me sauce poured over them. 

Obs. — The dish in which they are baked, should be buttered before 
they are laid in. 

FRIED MACKEREL. 

{Common French Receipt,) 

After the fish have been emptied and washed extremely clean, cut 
off the heads and tails, split the bodies quite open, and take out the 
backbones (we recommend in nreference that the flesh should be 
taken off the bones as in the following receipt), wipe the mackerel 
very dry, dust fine salt and pepper (or cayenne) over them, flour 
them weU, fry them a fine brown in boiling lard, drain them tho- 
rouffhly, and serve them with the following sauce : — Dissolve in a 
small saucepan an ounce and a half of butter smoothly mixed with a 
teaspoonful of 'flour, some salt, pepper, or cayenne ; shake these 
over a gentle fire until they are lightly coloured, then add b^ slow 
degrees nearlyhalf apint of good broth or gravy, and the juice of 
one large lemon ; boil the sauce for a cou^de of mmutes, and serve it

-very hot. Or, instead of this, add a large teaspoooitd of Strang made 
mustard, and a dessertspoonful of chili yid^^, to some thick melted 
butter, and serve it -with the fish. A spoonnil of Harvey*s sauce or 
of mnahroom catsup can be mixed with this last at pleasure. 

FILLETS OF VACEXREL. 

(Fried or Broiled.) 

Ttke off the flesh quite whole on either side, from three fine 
mackerel, which have been opened and properly cleaned ; let it be 
entirely free from bone, dry it well in a cloth, then divide each part 
in two, and dip them into the beaten yolks of a couple of eges, sea- 
soned with salt and white pepper, or cayenne ; cover them equally with 
fine dry crumbs of bread, and fry them like soles ; or dip them into 
elarifi^ butter, and then again into the crumbs, and brou them over 
a very dear fire of a fine brown. Dish them in a circle one over the 
other, and send them to table with the Maitre ^ Hotel sauce of 
Chapter V., or with the one which follows it. The French pour the 
saoce into the centre of the dish ; but for broiled fillets this is not so 
-wel], we think, as serving it in a tureen. The roes of tiie fish, after 
bemg well washed and soaked, may be dressed with them, or they 
may be made into patties. Minced parsley can be mixed with the 
brad crumbs when it is liked. 

BOILEP FILLETS OF MACKEREL. 

After having taken off and divided the flesh of the fish, as above, 
place it flat in one layer in a wide stewpan or saucepan, and just cover 
the fillets with cold water ; throw in a teaspoonful of salt, and two or 
three small sprigs of parsley ; bring the mackerel slowly to a boil, 
dear off the scum with care, and after two or three minutes of slow 
wmmering try the fiUets with a fork ; if the thick part divides with a 
touch, they are done. Lift them out cautiously with a slice ; drain, 
and serve them very hot with good parsley and butter ; or strip off 
the akin quickly, and pour a Maitre a* Hotel sauce over them. 

MACKEREL BROILED WHOLE. 

(An excellent Receipt,) 

Empty and cleanse perfectly a fine and very fresh mackerel, but 
without opening it more than is needful ; dry it well, either in a cloth 
or by hanging it in a cool air until it is stiff; make with a sharp 
knife a deep incision the whole length of the fish on dther side of the 
back bone, and about half an inch &om it, and with a feather put in 
a little cayenne and fine salt, mixed with a few drops of good sidad 
oil or clarified butter. Lay the mackerel over a moderate fire upon 
a well-heated jpridiron which has been rubbed with suet ; loosen it 
gently should it stick, which it will do unless often moved ; and when 
It is equally done on both aides, turn the back to the Aire. About

half an hour will broil it well. If a isheet of thickly-buttered writing- 
paper be folded round it, and just twisted at the ends before it is laid 
on the gridiron, it will be finer eating than if exposed to the fire ; but 
sometimes when this is done, the skin will adhere to the naper, and 
be drawn off with it, which injures its appearance. A cold Mditre 
d* Hotel sauce (see Chapter V.), may be put into the back before it is 
sent to table. This is one of the very best modes of dressing a 
mackerel, which in flavour is quite a different fish when thus pre- 
pared to one which is simply boiled. A drop of oil is sometunes 
passed over the skin to prevent its sticking to the iron. It may be 
laid to the fire after havmg been merely cut as we have directed, when 
it is preferred so.

MACKEREL STEWED WITH WINE. 

{Very good) 

Work very smoothly together a large teaspoonfiil of flour with two 
ounces of butter, put them into a stewpan, and stir or shake them 
round over the fire until the butter is dissolved; add a quarter of a 
teaspoonful of mace, twice as much salt, and some cayenne ; pour in 
by ^ow degrees three glasses of claret ; and when the sauce boils, lay 
in a couple of fine mackerel well cleaned, and wiped quite dry ; stew • 
them very softly from fifteen to twenty minutes, and turn them when 
half done ; lift them out, and dish them carefully; stir a teaspoonful 
of made mustard to the sauce, give it a boil, and pour it over the 
fish. When more convenient, substitute port wme and a little 
lemon-juice, for the claret. 

Mackerel, 2 ; flour, 1 teaspoonful ; butter, 2 oz. ; seasoning of salt,

(Excellent.) 
Bsdse the flesh entire from the bones on either side of the mackerel, 
and divide it once, if the fish be small, but cut the whole into six 
parts of equal size should they be large. Mix with flour, and dissolve 
the butter as in the preceding receipt ; and when it has simmered for 
a minute, throw in the spice, a little salt, and the thinly pared rind 
of half a small fresh lemon, lay in the fillets of fish, shake them over 
a gentle fire from four to five minutes, and turn them once in the 
time ; then pour to them in small portions a couple of large wine- 
^lassesful of port wine, a tablespoonml of Harvey's sauce, a teaspoon- 
lul of soy, and one of lemon-juice ; stew the mackerel very softly 
until the thinner parts begin to break, lift them out with care, dish 
and serve them in their sauce as hot as possible. We can recommend 
the dish to our readers as a very excellent one. A garnish of fried 
sippets can be placed round the fish at will. A teaspoonful of mado

spoonful ; soy and lemon-juice each, 1 teaspoonful : 4 to 6 minutes. 
MnstMid, 1 teaspoonful. 

Obs, — ^Trout may be dressed by this receipt. 

TO BOIL HADDOCKS. 

In the best season in October, NoTember, and December. 

Scrape the outsides very clean, 
open the fish, empty them, wash the 
insides thoroughly, take out the gills, 
curl the haddocks round, fasten the 
tails to the mouths, arrange them on 
Haddock. a fish-plate, and lay them into hot 

water salted as for mackereL Take off all the scum, and simmer 
them from seven to ten minutes or longer, according to their size, 
which, as we have said in the directions for " the best mode of cook- 
ing various kind of fish,** at the commencement of this chapter, varies 
greatly, as they are sometimes very large ; they must then oe brought 
more slowly to boil, and more time must be allowed for them. Send 
them very not to table, with a tureen of melted butter, and one of 
anchovy sauce. 
7 to 10 minutes. 

Obs.— In Scotland haddocks are skinned before they are boiled, 
and the heads are taken off; but we see no advantage in this mode 
of dressing them. Whitings, fresh herrings, and codlings, may all 
be dressed by this receipt, the time only being varied according to 
the size of the fish. 

BAKED HADDOCKS 

After they have been cleaned, dry them thoroughly, then bake 
them, as directed in the common receipt for pike, or fill them with 
oyster forcemeat, or with No. 1 of Chapter VIII., if more convenient, 
and proceed as for baked mackerel. 

20 to 30 minutes ; longer if very large. 

TO PRY HADDOCKS 

Follow the directions given for fillets of whitings ; or, should a 
more simple method be preferred, clean and dry the tish well, cut off 
the heads and tails, take out the backbones, cut each fish in three, 
egg and crumb them, fry them in 'boiling lard a fine golden brown, 
and serve them, well druned and dried, with the same sauces as boiled 
haddocks.

TO DRESS FINNAN HADDOCKS. 

These are slightly salted and dried. They are excellent eatings 
if genUy heated through upon the gridiron without being hardened ; 
and are served usuaUy at the br^ikfast or supper table ; a feather 
dipped in oil may be passed over them before they are laid to the 
fire. 

TO BOIL GURNARDS. 

{WUh direetiont for dressing them in other uxiys,) 

It is more usual to fill gurnards 
with forcemeat, and to bake them, 
or to haye the flesh raised from the 
f bones and dressed in fillets, than to 
serve them simply boiled ; they may, 
however, be cooked in any of the 
^^^ modes directed for mackerel,* rather 

^■"■"^ more time being allowed for them^ 

as they are much firmer-fleshed, thicker in the bodies, and generidly 
of larger size altogether. Cut off all the fins, take out the gills, and 
empty and cleanse them like other fish, washing the insides well ; put 
them into hot water ready salted and skimmed, and boil them gently 
from twenty minutes to half an hour ; serve them with anchovy- 
sauce, or with parsley and butter rendered add with chili vinegar, 
lemon-juice, or caper-pickle.

33en, and wash the insides with narticular care ; dry them well in a 
oth, take ofif the heads and tails, and remove the badcbones ; rub

bits of butter on them, and skewer two of the fish together as flat as 
possible, with the skin of both outside; flour, and broil or fry them 
of a fine brown, and serve them with melted butter mixed with a 
teaspoonful or more of mustard, some salt, and a little vinegar or

TO DRESS THE SEA BREAM. 

The sea-bream, which is commoii 
in many of our markets, is not con- 
sidered a fish of first-rate quality; but 
if well broiled or baked, it will afford 
a good, and generally a cheap, dish of 
excellent appearance, the bream being 
of handsome size and form. Open 
Sea Bream. *"*^ deanse it perfecUv, but do not 

remove the sodes ; fold it in t^. 
dry doth to absorb the moisture which hangs about it ; lay it oyer a 
gentle fire, and broil it slowly, that the heat may gradually pene- 
trate the flesh, which is thick. Should any cracks appear on 
the surfiioe, dredge a little flour upon them. If of ordinary 
weiffht, the bream will require quite half an hour*s broiling; 
it 3iould be turned, of course, when partially done. Send plam 
melted butter and anchoyy sauce to table wiUi it. In carying it, 
remoye the skia and scales, and serye only the flesh which lies be- 
neath them, and which will be yery white and succulent. A more 
usual and less troublesome mode of dressing the bream is to season 
the inside slightly with salt and pepper or cayenne, to dust a little 
more salt on Uie outside, spread a few bits of butter upon it, and send 
It to a gentle oyen. It is sometimes filled with common yeal-stuffiug,. 
and then requires to be rather longer baked ; and it is often merely 
wrapped in a buttered paper, and plaq^ in a moderate oyen for 
twenty-fiye or thirty minutes. 

TO BOIL PLAICE OR FLOUNDERS. 

Fluee in season firom May to Jannazy ; flounders inuSeptemberi October, and 
Korember. 

After haying emptied and well cleaned 
the fish, make an mcision in the back 
as directed for turbot ; lay them into 
cold spring water ; add salt and salt- 
petre m the same proportion as for cod 
fish, and let them just simmer for four 
or fiye minutes alter the water first 
begins to boil, or longer should their 
Plaice. size require it, but guard against their 

being broken. Serye them with plain melted butter. 
4 to 5 minutes ; longer if needful. 

TO FRY PLAICE OR FLOUNDERS. 

Sprinkle them with salt, and let them lie for two or three hours 
before they are dressed. Wash and clean them thoroughly, wipe 
them yery dry, flour them well, and wipe them again with a clean

doth ; dip them into egg;, and fine bread-crumbs, and fry tbem in 
plenty of lard. If the fish be large, raise the flesh in handsome 
lillets from the bones, and finish them as directed for fillets of soles. 

Obi. — Plaice is said to be rendered less watery by beating it gently 
with a paste-roller before it is cooked. It is very sweet and pleasant 
in flavour while it is in the best season, which is from the end of May 
to about September. 

TO ROAST, BAKE, OR BROIL RED MULLET. 
In best season through the Bommer: may be had all the year. 
Jl First wash and then dry the fish 

^^■l ^^ thoroughly in a cloth, but neither 

^^^^^dOL^ scale nor open it, but take out the 

^^^BK^^^^g^K^ gi^ls gently and carefullv with the 
iy*^pMa»iBf^^^^ small intestine which will adhere to 
^ ^^ them ; wrap it closely in a sheet of 

Red Mullet. thickly buttered paper, tie this se- 

curely at the ends, and over the mullet with packthread, and roast it 
in a Dutch oven, or broil it over a clear and gentle fire, or bake it in 
a moderate oven : from twenty to twenty-five minutes will be suffi- 
cient generally to dress it in either way. For sauce, put into a little 
good melted butter the liquor which has flowed from the fish, a small 
dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies, some cayenne, a glass of port 
wine, or claret, and a little lemon-iuice. Remove the packthread, 
and send the mullet to table in the paper case. This is the usual 
mode of serving it, but it is dished without the paper for dinners of 
taste. The pkun red mullet^ shown at the commencement of this 
receipt, is scarcely ever found upon our coast That which abounds 
here during the summer months is the striped red mullet, or turmuUet^ 
which, from its excellence, is always in request, and is therefore sel- 
dom cheap. It rarely exceeds twelve, or" at the utmost fourteen, 
inches in length. 
20 to 30 minutes. 

TO BOIL GREY MULLET. 

This fish varies so much in size 
and quality, that it is difficult to give 
^ exact directions for the time of cook- 
ing it. When quite young and small, 
"^ ^^ it may be boiled by the receipt for 

GreyMuUet. whitings, haddocks, and other fish of 

about their size ; but at its finest 
growth it must be laid into cold water, and managed like larger 
fish. We have ourselves partaken of one which was caught upon 
our eastern coafet, that weighed ten pounds, of which the flesh was 
quite equal to that of salmon, but its weight was, we believe, an 
unusual one. Anchovy, or caper fish sauce, with melted butter, 
may be sent to table with grey mullet

THE GAR-FISB. 

Thb is a fish of yery singu- 
lar apfpearancc, donsated in 
form, and with a moutn which 
resemhles the bill of the snipe, 
from which circumstance it is 
often called the snipe-fish. _ _, , 

Ita bones are all of a bright ^" ^**- 

greea colour. It is not to be recommended for the table, as the skin 
coq^aina an oil of exceedingly strong rank flavour ; when entirely 
dirested of this, the flesh is tolerably sweet and palatable. Persons 
who may be disposed from curiosity to taste it will find either 
broiling or baking in a gentle oven the best mode of cooking it. It 
should be curled round, and the tail fastened into the bill. As it is 
not of large siae, from fifteen to twenty minutes will dress it suf- 
ficiently. Anchovy sauce, pargley and butter, or plain melted butter, 
may be eaten with it 

SAND-LAUNCE, OR^ SAND-EEL, 

The sand-launce, which is abund- 
ant on many parts of our coast, and 
the name of which is derived from 
its habit of burrowing in the sands 
when the tide retires, may be dis- SmmI-e i 

tingoished from the lar^ species, 

the true scmd'eel, by its hghter colour and more transparent appear- 
ance, as well as by its inferior size. The common mode of dressing 
the fish, which is considered by many a great delicacy, is to divest 
them of their heads, and to remove the insides with the ^Is, to 
dry them well in a cloth with flour, and to fry them until crisp. 
They are sometimes also dipped in batter like smelts. We have not 
ourselves had an opportumty of testing them, but we have received 
the particulars which we have given here from various friends who 
have resided where they were plentiful. The sand-eels are not so 
good as the smaller kind of these fish called hunces. 

TO FRY SMELTS. 
[In senaon firom beginning of NoTember to May.] 

Smelts when quite fresh have a perfume resembling that of a 
cucumber, and a peculiarly delicate and agreeable flavour when 
dressed* Draw them at the gills, as they must not be opened ; wash 
and dry them thoroughly in a cloth ; dip them into beaten egg-yolk, 
and then into the finest bread-cruml», mixed with a very bmall 
quantity of flour ; fry them of a clear golden bro^m, and serve them

times dipped into batter and then fried ; when this is done, we would 
Tecommend for them the French batter of Chapter Y 
3 to 4 minutes. 

BAKED SMELTS. 

Prepare them as for frying; pour some clarified butter into the 
dish in which they are to be sent to table, arrange them neatly in it, 
with the tails meeting in the centre^ strew over them as muoi salt, 
mace, and cayenne, mixed, as will season them agreeably, cover 
them smoothly with a rather thick layer of very fine bread-crumbs, 
moisten them eaually with clarified butter poured through a small 
strainer, and bale the fish in a moderately quick oven, until the 
crumbs are of a fine light brown. A glass of sherry, half a tea- 
spoonful of essence of anchovies, and a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, 
are sometimes poured into the dish before the smelts are laid in. 

About 10 nunutes. 

TO DRESS WHITE BAIT. 

(^Oreenwich Receipt^ 

[In season in July, Angast, and September.] 

This delicate little fish requires great care to dress it well. Do not 
touch it with the hands, but throw it from your dish or basket into 
a cloth, with three or four handsful of flour, and shake it well ; then 
put it into a bait sieve, to separate it from the superfluous flour. 
Have ready a very deep frying-pui, nearly full of boiling fat, throw 
in the fish, whicn will be done in an instant : they must not be 
allowed to take any colour, for if browned, they are spoiled. Lift 
them out, and dish them upon a silver or earthenware drainer, with- 
out a napkin, piling them very high in the centre. Send them to 
table with a cut lemon, and slices of brown bread and butter. 

WATER SOUCHY. 

(Qreenwich Receipt) 

This is a very simple and inexpensive dish, much served at the 
regular fish-dinners for which Greenwich is celebrated, as well as at 
private tables. It is excellent if well prepared ; and as it may be 
made with fish of various kinds when they are too small to present 
a good appearance or to be palatable dressed in anv other way, it is 
also very economical. Flounders, perch, tench, and eels^ are said to 
answer best fpr water souchy; but very delicate soles, and several 
other varieties of small white fish are often used for it with good 
eflect : it is often made also with slices of salmon, or of salmon-peel, 
freed from the skin. 

Throw into rather more than sufficient water to just ooyer the 



CBAP. n.] FISH. 79 

q[iifliitity offish reqiiired for table, from half to three qnarten of an 
ounce of salt to the quart, a dozen corns of white pepper, a small 
bunch of green parsley, and two or three tender panlej roots, first 
eut into inch lengths, and then split to the size or straws. Simmer 
the mixture until these last are tender, which will be in from half to 
a whole hour ; then lay in the fish delicately cleaned, cleared from 
ever^ morsel of brown skin, and divided into equal portions of about 
two inches in width. Take off all the scum as it rises, and stew the 
fish softly from eight to twelve minutes, watching it that it may not 
break from being over-done. 

Two minutes before it is dished, strew in a large tablespoonful or 
more of minced parsley, or some small branches of the herb boiled 
very green in a separate saucepan (we prefer the latter mode) ; lift 
out the fish care^y with a slice, and the parsley roots with it ; pour 
over it the liouor in which it has been boiled, but leave out the 
peppercorns, i'or a superior water souchy, take all the bones out of 
the fish, and stew down the inferior portions of it to a strong broth : 
about an hour will be sufficient for this. Salt, parslev, and a little 
cayenne may be added to it. Strain it ofif clear through a sieve, and 
use it instead of water for the souchy. The juice of half a good 
lemon may be thrown into the stew before it is served. A deep dish 
will of course be required for it. The parsley-roots can be boiled 
apart when more convenient, but they give an agreeable flavour 
when added to the liquor at first. Slices of brown or white bread 
and butter must be sent to table always with water soucl^r : the first 
is usually preferred, but to suit all tastes some of each may be served 
with it. 

« SHAD; TOURAINE FASHION. 

(Alose a la mode de Tourcdne^ 
[In season in April, May, and earl j part of June.] 

Empty and wash the fish with care, but do not open it more than 
is needful; fill it either with the forcemeat Ko. 1, or No. 2 of 
Chapter VIII., and its own roe ; then sew it up, or fasten it securely 
with very fine skewers, wrap it in a thickly buttered paper, and broil 
it gently for an hour over a charcoal fire. Serve it with caper sauce, 
or with chili vinegar and melted butter. 

We are indebted for this receipt to a friend who has been long 
resident in Touraine, at whose table the fish is constantly served thus 
dressed, and is considered excellent. It is likewise often gently 
stewed in the light white wine of the country, and served covered 
with a rich h^hamel. Many fish more common with us than the 
shad might be advantageously prepared in the same manner. The 
charcoal fire is not incBspensable : any one that is entirely free from 
smoke will answer. We would suggest as an improvement, that 
oyster- forcemeat should be substituted for that which we have indi- 
cated, until the oyster season ends. 

Broiled gently, 1 hour, more or less, according to the siae.

STEWED TROUT. 

{Oood common Receipt) 
[In season firom May to Angost] 

Melt three ounces of butter in ft 
broad stewpan, or well tinned iron 
saucepan, stir to it a tablespoonful 
of flour, some mace, cayenne, and 
nutmeg : lay in the fish after it has 
,^ been emptied, washed very clean, 

"^* and wiped perfectly dry ; shako it in 

the pan, that it may not stick, and when lightly browned on both 
sides, pour in three quarters of a pint of good v^ stock, add a small 
faggot of parsley, one bay leaf, a roll of lemon-peel, and a little 
salt : stew the fish very gendy from half to three quarters of an hour, 
or more, should it be unusuaUy fine. Dish the trout, skim the fat 
from the grayy, and pass it through a hot strainer over the fish, 
which should be served immediately. A little acid can be added to 
the sauce at pleasure, and a glass of wine when it is considered 
an improvement. This receipt is for one large or for two middling- 
sized fish. We can recommend it as a good one from our own expe- 
rience. 

Butter, 8 oz. ; flour, 1 tablespoonful ; seasoning of mace, cayenne, 
and nutme/; trout, 1 large, or 2 moderate-sized ; veal stock, | pint ; 
parsley, small faggot ; 1 bay-leaf; roll of lemon-rind ; little salt : \ to 
f hour. 

Oht, — Trout may be stewed in equal parts of strong vea^ gra>'y, 
and of red or white wine, without having been previously browned ; 
the sauce should then be thickened, and agreeably flavoured with 
lemon-juice, and the usual store-sauces, before it is poured over the 
fish. They are also good when wrapped in buttered paper, and baked 
or broiled : if very small, the better mode of cooking them is to fry 
them whole. They should never be plain boiled, as, though naturally 
a delicious fish, they are then very insipid. 

TO BOIL PIKE. 
[In best season flrom September to Febmary.] 

Take out the gills, empty and clean 
the fish very thoroughly, and soak it 
for half an hour with a cup of vinegar 
thrown into as much water as will

with ojBter-foroemeat, or unth common veal forcemeat made either 
with bntter or with suet (for which see Chapter VIII.) ; curl the fish 
romid, and fasten it with the tail in the mouth, lay it on a fish-plate, 
coTer it well with cold water, throw in some salt as soon as it 
boik, skim it well, and boil the fish gently from half to a whole hour 
acoordmg to its size. Some persons prefer the scales taken off the 
{rike when it is prepared for this mode of dressins^ ; and many cooks 
still put the fish into boiling water well salted and skimmed. Serve 
it with plain melted butter, or anchovy sauce. 

Moderate sized, ) hour ; large, 1 hour. 

Oha. — ^We must repeat that it is impossible to gpive for fish which 
varies so much in quality as well as in size, directions for the exact 
time which is required to cook it ; a few minutes, more or less, must 
often be allowed ; and it should always be watched attentively, and 
lifted from the water as soon as it is done. 

TO BAKE PIKE. 

(Common Receipt,) 

Pour warm water over the outside of the fish, and wipe it very dean 
with a coarse doth drawn from the head downwards, that the scales 
may not be disturbed ; then wash it well in cold water, empty, and 
deanse the inside with the greatest nicety, fill it either with the com- 
mon forcemeat No. 1, or with Np. 4 of Chapter YIU., sew it up, 
fitften the tail to the mouth, give it a slight dredcine of flour, stidc 
small bits of bntter thickly over it, and bake it from naff to three quar* 
ters of an hour, should it be of moderate size, and upwards of an hour, 
if it be large. Should there not be suffident sauce with it in the 
dish, melted butter and a lemon, or anchovy sauce may be sent to 
table with it. When more convenient the forcemeat may be omitted, 
and a little fine salt and cayenne, with some bits of butter, put into 
the inside of the fish, which will then require rather less bakins;. A 
buttered paper should always be laid over it in the oven, should the 
outside appear likely to become too highly coloured or too dry before 
the fish is done ; and it is better to wrap quite small pike in buttered 
psoer at once before they are sent to the oven. 

3loderate-sized pike, 30 to 45 minutes ; large pike, 1 to 1^ hour. 

TO BAKB PIKE. 

(JSuperior Receipt) 

Scale and wash the fish, take out the gills, then open it just suf- 
ficiently to allow the inside to be emptied and perfectly deaneed^ 
but not more than is necessary for that purpose. Wipe it as dry as 
ponible in every part, then hang it for an hour or two on a hook in 
a eoo . larder, or wrap it in a soil cloth. Fill the body with the force- 
meat Kg. 1 or 3, or with the oyster forcemeat of Chapter YULL ; sew

with a tmn skewer, then dip it into the beaten yolks of two or more 
eggs, seasoned ¥rith nearly half a teaspoonful of mlt and a little pepper 
or cayenne ; cover it equally with the finest bread crumbs, cup it a 
second time into the egg and crumbs, then pour some clarified butter 
gently over it, throunTjEi small strainer, and send it to a well heated 
oven for an hour and a quarter or more, should it be very large, but 
for less time if it be only of moderate size. As it is naturally a veiy 
dry fish, it should not be left in the oven after it ia thorougluy done, 
but it should never be sent to table until it is so. The crumbs of 
bread are sometimes mixed with a sufficient quantity of minced parsley 
to ffive the surface of the fish a green hue. bend plain melted butter^ 
and brown caper, or Dutch sauce to table widi it 

TO 8TBW CARP. 

(A common Country Receipt) 

Scale and dean the fish with exceeding 
care, lay it into a stewpm, and cover it 
with good cold beef or .veal bro^ ; add 
' one small onion stuck with a few cloves, 
a faggot of savoury herbs, three or four 
^^' slices of carrot, and a little salt, and stew 

the carp as gently as possible for nearly an hour. Have ready some 
good brown gravy, mixed with a couple of glassesful of port wine 
add a squeeze of lemon-juice, dish the carp very carefully, pour the 
sauce over, and serve it immediately. We would recommend the 
Genevese Sauce, of Chapter Y ., as superior to any other for this 
dish. 

This receipt is for a fish which averages from five to six pounds in 
weight, but tne carp sometimes attains to a very large size ; and suf- 
ficient time to cook it perfectly should always be allowed for it. 



First wipe or wash off the slime, then 
scrape off tne scales, which adhere rather 
tenaciously to this fish ; empty and clean 
the insides perfectly, take out the gills, 
cut off the fins, and lay the perch into 
equal parts of cold and of boiling water, 
salted as for mackerel : from eight to ten minutes will boil them un- 
less they are very large. Dish them on a napkin, garnish them with

corkd parsley, and serve melted butter with them, or MaUre tT Hotel 
Sawee Maigre. 

Yery good French cooks put them at once into boiling water and 
keep them over a brisk fire for about fifteen minutes, They dress 
them also without taking off the scales or fins until they are roidy to 
serre, when they strip the whole of the skin off carefully, and stick 
the red fins into the middleof the backs; the fish are then covered with 
the Steward*s sauce, thickened with ^;gs. 

In warm water, 8 to 10 minutes ; in bdling, 12 to 15. 

TO FRY PERCH OR TENCH. 

Scale, and clean them perfectly; dry them well, flour and fry 
them in boiling lard. Serve plenty of crisped or fried parsley roimd 
them.

months.] 

first kill, then skin, empty, and wash them as dean as possible ; 
cut them into four-inch lengths, and dry them well in a soft doth. 
Season them with fine salt, and white pepper, or cayenne, flour them 
thickly, and fry them a fine brown in boiling lard ; drain and dry 
them as directed for soles, and send them to table with plain melted 
butter or anchovy sauce. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter and 
then fried ; or into e^ and fine bread-crumbs (mixed with minced 
parsley or not, at pleasure), and served with plenty of crisped parsley 
round, and on them. 

It is an improvement for these modes of dressing the fish to open 
them entirdy ; and remove the bones : the smaller parts should be 
thrown into the pan a minute or two later than the tnicker portions 
of Uie bodies or Uiey will not be equally done. 

BOILED EELS. 

{Oerman Receipt,), 

Pare a fine lemon, and strip from it entirely the white inner rind ; 
slice it, and remove the pins with care ; put it with a blade of mace, 
a small half-teaspoonful of white peppercorns, nearly twice as much 
of salt, and a moderate-sized bunch of pardey, into three pints of 
cold water, bring them gently to boil, and simmer them for twenty 
minutes ; let them become ^uite cold ; then put in three pounds of 
eels skinned; and cleaned with ereat nicety, and cut into lengths of 
three or four inches ; eiminer them very softly from ten to fifteen 
minutes, lift them with a slice into a very hot dish, and serve them 
with a good Dutch sauce, or with parsley and butter addulated 
with lemon-juice, or with chili vin^^.

Cookerjf.

EELS. 

(Cornish Receipt) 

Skin, empty, and wash as clean as possible, two or three fine eels, 
cut them into short lengths, and jnst coyer them with cold water ; 
add sufficient salt and cayenne to season them, and stew them very 
softly indeed from fifteen to twenty minutes, or longer should they 
require it. When they are nearly done, strew over them a teaspoonM 
of minced parsley, thicken the sauce with a teaspoonful of flour mixed 
with a slice of butter, and add a quarter of a pint or more of clotted 
cream. Give the whole a boil, lilt the fish into a hot dish, and stir 
briskly the juice of half a lemon into the sauce; pour it upon the 
eels, and serve them immediately: Very sweet thick cream is, we 
think, preferable to clotted cream for this dish. The sauce should be 
of a gaK)d consistence, and a dessertspoonful of flour will be needed for 
a large dish of the stew, and from one and a half to two ounces of 
butter. The size of the fish must determine the precise quantity of 
liquid and of seasoning which they will require. 

RED HERRINGS^ X LA DAUPHIN. 

Take off the heads, open the backs of the fish, and remove the 
back-bones : soak the herrings, should they be very dry, for two or 
three hours in warm milk and water, drain and wipe them. Dissolve 
a slice of fresh butter, and mix it with the beaten yolks of a couple 
of eggs and some savoury herbs minced small : dip the fish into these, 
and spread them thickly with fine bread crumbs ; broil them of a 
light Drown, over a moaerate fire, and serve them on hot buttered 
toasts, sprinkled with a little cayenne. 

RED HBRRINQS, COMMON ENGLISH MODE. 

This fish is rendered infinitely more delicate by pouring boiling 
water on it before it is dressed, and leaving it to soak for half an 
hour, or more, should it be highly dried. The fresh Yarmouth bloaters 
do not require this. Cut off the heads and tails, open the herrings at 
the back, and warm them through before the fire, or upon the grid- 
iron. They majr be rubbed witn a bit of cold butter, and seasoned 
with a slight sprinkling of pepper or cayenne, when these are liked, 
or served quite plain. 

ANCHOTIES FRIED IN BATTER. 

Scrape very clean a dozen or more of fine anchovies, and soak them 
in plenty of spring water from two to six hours : then wipe them dry, 
open them, and take out the back-bones, without dividing the fish. 
Season the insi ies highlv with cayenne, close the anchovies, dip them 
into the French batter of Chapter v., or into a light English batter, and 
fry them a pale amber-colour : in from fcur to five minutes they wiU 
be quite sufficiently done.

CHAPTER III. 




OYSTERS. 
[In season from September to April.] 
The old-fashioned plan oifeedine oysters with a sprinkling of oat- 
meal or flour, in addition to the salt and water to which they were 
committed, has lon^ heen rejected by all genuine amateurs of these 
nutritious and excellent fish, who consider the plumpness which the 
oysters are supposed to gain from the process, but poor compensation 
for the flaTour which they are sure to lose. To eleanse them when 
they first conw up from the beds, and to keep them in good condi- 
tion for four or five days, they only reouire to be covered with cold 
-water, with five ounces of salt to the gallon dissolved in it before it is 
poured on them ; this should be changed with regularity every twenty- 
four hours. By following this plan with exactness they may be kept 
ilive from a week to ten days, but will remain in perfect condition 
scarcely more than half that time. Oysters should be eaten always the 
instant they are opened. Abroad they are served before the soup in the 



86 MODERN COOKEBT* [chap. m. 

•first coarse of a dinner, arranged lunallj in as many plates as there are 
guests at table. In England they are sometimes served after the soup. 
A sense of appropriateness must determine how far the variations of 
fashion should be followed in such matters. 

Obs, — ^We were accustomed formerly to have the brine which was 
supplied to ovsters intended to be kept for some days, changed twice in. 
the twenty-four hours ; but we were informed by an oyster merchant 
in an extensive business that once was sufficient. 

TO SCALLOP 0T8TEBS. 

Large coarse oysters should never be dressed in this way. Select 
small plump ones for Uie purpose, let them be opened carerally, give 
them a scald in their own liquor, wash them in it free from grit, and 
beard them neatly. Butter the scallop shells and shake some fine 
bread-crumbs over them ; fill them with alternate layers of oysters, 
crumbs of bread, and fresh butter cut into small bits; pour in the 
oyster-liquor, after it has been strained, put a thick, smooth layer of 
bread-crumbs on the top, moisten them with clarified butter,* place 
the shells in a Dutch oven before a clear fire, and turn them oflen. 
until the tops are equally and lightly browned: send them immedi- 
ately to table. 

Some persons like a little white pepper or cayenne, and a flavour- 
ing of nutmeg added to the oysters ; others prefer pounded mace. 
French cooks recommend with them a mixftnre of minced mushrooms 
stewed in butter till quite tender, and sweet herbs finely chopped. 
The fish is sometimes laid into the shells after having been bearded 
only. 

SCALLOPED OTSTERS ^ LA REIMS. 

Flump and beard the oysters, after having rinsed them well in 
their own strained liquor ; add to this about an equal quantity of 
very rich white sauce, and thicken it, if needful, with half a teaspoon- 
f\il of flour, mixed with a small slice of butter, or with as much 
arrow-root only ; put in the oysters, and keep them at the point of 
simmering for three or four minutes : lay them into the shdls, and 
cover the tops thickly with crumbs fried a delicate brown and well 
dried ; or heap over them instead, a layer of fine crumbs ; pour da- 
srified butter on them, and brown them with a salamander 

TO 8T£W OYSTERS. 

A pint of small plump oysters wiU be sufficient for a quite mode- 
rate-sized dish, but twice as many will be required for a lam one. 
Let them be very carefully opened, and not mangled in the sughtest 
degree; wash them firee from grit in their own strained liquor, lay 

• Common oooki menly stiok small bits of batter on tlieaBu

diem into a Tery dean stewpan or well-tinned aaneepan, strain the 
liquor a second time, poor it on them, and heat them slowly in 
it. When th^ are jnst beginning to simmer, lifb them out with a 
dioe or a bored wooden spoon, and take off the beards ; add to the 
liquor a quarter of a pint of good cream, a seasoning of jpoimded maoe, 
and cayenne, and a bttle salt, and when it boils, stir in from one to 
two ounces of good butter, smoothly mixed with a large teaspoonfal 
of flour; continue to stir the sauce until these are penectly blended 
with it, then put in the oysters, and let them remam by the side of 
the fire until they are yery hot : they require so little cooking that, 
if kept for four or fiye minutes nearly simmering, they will be ready 
for table, and they are quickly hardened by being allowed to boil, 
or by too much stewing. Serye them gaoTiished with pale fried 



^mall plump oysters, 1 pint : their own liquor : brought slowly to 
the point of simmering. Cream, i pint; seasoning of pounded mace 
and cayenne ; salt as needed ; butter, 1 to 2 oz. ; flour, 1 laige tea- 
spoonml. 

Obs, — A little lemon-juice should be stirred quickly into the stew 
just as it is taken from the fire. Another mc^e of preparing this 
dish, is to add the strained liquor of the oysters to about an equal 
quantity of rich bechamel, with a little additional thickening ; men 
to heat them in it, after haying prepared and plumped them properly. 
Or, the beards of the fish may be stewed for half an hour in a little 
pale grayy, or good broth, and this, when strained and mixed with 
the oyster-liquor, may be brought to the consistency of cream with 
the French thickening of Chapter Y., or, with flour and butter, then 
seasoned with spice as aboyc : the process should be quite the same 
in all of these receipts, though the composition of the sauce is yaried. 
Essence of anchoyies, cayice, chili yinegar, or yolks of eggs can be 
added to the taste.

and let them become cold, dip them into egg and bread-crumbs, and 
broil them gently until they are lishtly coloured. A small bit

seasoning may be heightened if required. The sausages thus made are 
extremefy good : the fingers should be well floured in making them 
up.

TO BOIL LOBSTERS. 
[In full season from April to October: may be had all the year.] 

Choose them by the directions given at the commencement of this 
chapter, and throw them into plenty of fast-boiling salt and water, 
that life may be destroyed in an instant. 

To 1 gallon of water, 5 ounces salt : moderate sized lobster, 15 to 20 
minutes ; large lobster, 30 to 40 minutes ; very large, 1 hour or more 

COLD DRESSED LOBSTER AND CRAB. 

Before a lobster is sent to 
table take off the large 
claws, hold each of them 
firmly with the edge up- 
wards, and with a quick 
light blow from a cutlet bat 
oroughtelse convenient for 
th e purpose, crack the shell 
without disfiguring the 
fish. Split the tail open 
withaveryshaipknifeand Dressed Lobster, 

dish the lobster in the manner shown in the engraving, either with, or 
without a napkin under it. When the soft part of the body is re- 
quired to mix with the dressing, take it out before it is served, 
and add it to the remoulade^ or other sauce with which it is to be 
mingled. The shrimp chatney of Chapter YI. is a wholesome accom- 
paniment to this fish ; which we nmst remark here should be 
sparingly eaten, or altogether avoided, by persons in delicate health, 
and especially at night. It is too much the fashion to serve 
it as a supper dish at parties ; and it sometimes produces dangerous 
attacks of mdi^estion and other illness. The flesh of the crab is much 
lighter. This is served in the shell, which should be entirelv emptied 
and nicely cleaned out ; the sides filled with the white flesh divided 
into small flakes, and the centre with the soft part or cream as it is 
called. 





CHAP, in.] FISH. 89 

The flesh of two crabs 
can be serred in one shell 
when a dish of handsome 
appearance is required, and 
the sance can be mixed 
with it the instant before

will be whiter, ancl of letter

centre may be filled with a 

red Ln^rial Mayonnaxse^ when a good effect is wanted. For other 
appropriate sauces see Chapter YL 

LOBSTERS; FRICASSEED, OR AU BiCHAMEL. (ENTRiE.) 

Take the flesh from the claws and tails of two moderate-sized lobsters 
cut it into small scallops or dice ; heat it slowly quite through in about 
three quarters of a ^int of good white sauce oi bechamel ; and serve it 
when It is at the point of boiling, after having stirred briskly to it a 
little lemon-juice just as it is taken from the fire. The coral, pounded 
and mixed graduaiiy with a few spoonsful of the sauce, should be added 
preriously. Good shin of beef stock made without v^etables (see 
page 97), and somewhat reduced by quick boiling, if mixed with an 
equal proportion of cream, and thickened with arrow- root, will answer 
extremely well in a general way for this dish, which is most excel- 
lent if well made. The sauce should never be thin ; nor more than 
sufficient in quantity to just cover the fish. For a second course dish, 
only as much must be used as will adhere to the fish, which after being 
heated should be laid evenly into the shells, which ought to be split 
quite through the centre oi the backs in their entire length, without 
bdng broken or divided at the joint, and nicely cleaned, When thus 
arranged, the lobster may be thickly covered with well dried, fine, pale 
fried crumbs of bread, or with unfried ones, which must then be 
equally moistened with clarified butter, and browned with a sala- 
mander. A small quantity of salt, mace, and cayenne, may be re^ 
quired to finish the flavouring of either of these preparations. 

HOT CRAB, OR LOBSTER. 

(In season during the same time as Lobsters,) 

Slice quite small, or pull into light flakes with a couple of forks, 
the flesh of either fish ; put it into a saucepan with a few bits of good 
butter lightly rolled in flour, and heat it slowly over a gentle fire ; 
then pour over and thoroughly mix with it, from one to two tea- 
ypoonsful or more of common or of chili vinegar ; if with the former, 
add to it a tolerable seasoning of cayenne. Grate in a little nutmeg, 
and when the whole is well heated serve it immediately, either inUic

shell of the crab or lobster, or m Bcallop-shells, and serve it plain, or 
with bread-cnimbs over, as in the preceding receipt. A spoonful or 
so of ffood meat jelly is, we think, a great improyement to this dish, 
for which an ounce and a half of butter will be quite sufficient. 
This is sometimes called Buttered Crab, 



POTTED LOBSTERS. 

Separate carefully the flesh of fireshly-boUed lobsters from the 
sheQs, and from the tough red skin of the tails, mince the fish up 
quickly with a yery sharp knife, turn it immediately into a large 
mortar, and strew oyer it a mixed seasoning of fine cayenne, pounded 
mace, lightly grated nutmeg, and salt : this last should be sparingly 
used ia the first instance, and it should be reduced to powder before 
it is added. Foimd the lobsters to a nerfect paste with from two to 
three ounces of firm new butter to eacn fish if of large size, but with 
less should it be small; and the lobster-coral preyiously rubbed 
through a sieve, or with a portion of it only, should any part of it be 
required for other purposes. When there is no coral, a fine colour 
may be given to the mixture by stewing the red skin of the tails vs&t 
softly for ten or twelve minutes in part of the butter which is used 
for it, but which must be strained and left to become perfectly cold 
before it is mingled with the fish. The desree of Beaaomng given to 
the mixture can be regulated by the taste ; out no flavour should pre- 
dominate over that of the lobster itself; and for all delicate prepara- 
tions, over-spicing should be particularly avoided. A quart or more 
of fine brown smimps, if very fresh and quickly shelled at the in- 
stant of using, may be chopped up and pound^ with the lobsters 
with excellent eflect. Before the mixture is taken from the mortar 
it should be placed in a cool larder, or set over ice for a short time, 
to render it firm before it is pressed into the potting-pans or moulds. 
In putting it into these, be careful to press it into a compact, evea 
mass ; smooth the surface, run a little clarified butter over, when it 
is only just liquid^ for if hot it would prevent the fish from keeping 
— and send tne lobster to table, neatly garnished with light green, 
foliaf^e ; or with omamentalljr-cut paper ustened round the mould ^ 
or with a small damask napkm tastefully arranged about it. 

Ohs, — ^By pounding separately part of the white flesh of the fish, 
freed from every particle of the skin, and by colouring the remainder 
highly with the coral of the lobster, and then pressing the two in al- 
ternate and regular layers into a mould, a dish of pretty appearance 
is produced, which should be turned out of the mould for table. 
Ham and turkey (or any other white meat) are often potted in this

LOBSTER CUTLETS. 

{A Superior SnirSe.) 

Prepiie and pound with exceeding nicety, by the pieeedinff reeebt 
for Potted Lobsters, about three quarters of a pouna of the flesh of a 
coupk of fine fresh lobsters, of which one must be a hen lobster ; add 
to it, when it is partially beaten, an ounce and a half of sweet new 
butter, a saltspoonfbl of salt, and about two-thirds as much of mixed 
mace and cayenne, with a dessertspoonful of the inside coral, the 
whole of which should be rubbed with a wooden spoon through a 
hair siere, to be in readiness for use. When all these ingredients 
are well blended, and beaten to the finest and smoothest paste, the 
mixture should be tested by the taste, and the seasoning heightened 
if Deedful ; but, as the preparation la very delicate, it should not be 
•over-spiced. Mould it mto the form of small cutlets about the third 
of an inch thick, stick into each a short bit of the smallest daws, 
strew the coral lightly over them so as to give them the appea r ance 
of beinff crumbed with it, arrange them round the dish in wnich they 
are to be sent to table, place them in a yery gentle oven for eight or 
ten minutes only to heat them through, or warm them in a Dutch or 
American oyen, placed at some distance from the fire, that the brilliant 
colour of the cond may not be destroyed; and pour into the centre 
some good hkhamel (peejMgd 108), or the Lady's Sauce, or the 
Cieam Sauce of Chapter lY . A very white sauce best contrasts with 
the colour of the cutlets. This is an excellent and el^;ant dish, of 
which an admirable variety is made by the addition of three or four 
ounces of the freshest shrimps, quicUy shelled, and chopped before 
thcnr are thrown into the mortar, yrith naif an ounce of butter and a 
little spioe. All the coral can be added to the cutlets at pleasure ; 
but it IB generally in request for many purposes, and is required for 
this one only in part 

Oht. — ^As lobsters are well known to be the most indigestible of 
shell fish, and as they sometimes proye danfferously so to persons out 
of health, these pounded preparations are the best and safest forms in 
which thjnr can oe served : they should at all times be beaten to a 
smooth, >SKreZei# paste, before they are taken from the mortar ; and 
no fish uat is not entirely fresh should eyer be used for them. Prawns 
may be advantageously served in the same maimer. 
For Indian Lobster Cutlets, see Chapter of Foreign Cookery. 

LOBSTER SAUBAQES. 

Let the fish be pounded as for the cutlets above or for hmdmetiet^

and heat them throueh in a Dutch or American oven. They maj 
be brushed vdth clarified butter before the coral is strewed over them, 
but they scarcely need it. A fierce degree of heat will destroy the 
excellence of all these preparations. 

BOUDIKETTES OF LOBSTERS^ PRAWNS^ OR SHRIMPS. (ENTRiE). 

(AtUhor^s Beceipt,) 

When the fish has been prepared as above, mould it in as many 
very smdU round cups as vnll sufiSce for a dish ; heat them gently 
through at the mouth of the oven or before the fire, and serve them 
dry, or with a little rich white sauce, coloured with lobster-coral 
poured round, but not upon them. These boudinettet are delicious, 
made entirely of shrimps or^rawns, which it is an advantage to have 
prepared as follows, either for this purpose or for potting simply, as 
they vnll then be firmer, and will also remain gcK>d much longer : 
— Shell them quickly, and touch them as little ba possible in the 
process; put tnem into an enamelled saucepan witn about three 
ounces of butter to the quart, and strew tne spice upon them ; 
place them by the side of a gentle fire that they may heat through 
very gradually, and shake the saucepan roimd occasionally to min^e 
the seasoning equally with them. Do not allow them to boil, as 
that would render them tough, but when they are heated quite 
through and the butter approaches the point of sinunering, draw 
them from the fire ; let them remain for a few minutes in the sauce- 
pan, then lay them very evenly and closely into the pans and pour 
the butter on them ; but let it be clear from sediment, or from any 
liauid which may be perceptible at the bottom of the saucepan. 
When merely required for boudinettes, the fish may be turned into a 
large pan or basin and left imtil thoroughly cold, then chopped 
small upon a dish with the butter in which they are imbedded, and 
pounded as usual; no additional butter will be required for them, 
and part of that in which they have been heated may be set aside 
for fish-sauce when the proportion of it directed here is considered 
too large. As it should cover the shrimps entirely when they are 
potted whole, sufiicient to do so should be melted with them. It is 
an excellent plan to dissolve it in a separate saucepan, to skim it 
well, and after it has stood to become clear, to pour it gently over 
the shrimps, leaving all the buttermilk behind. They should not be 
placed immediately by the fire, or they will heat too quickly : they 
should be set away from it until the butter has cooled upon them. 
J f carefully prepared, and agreeably seasoned, they will be excellent, 
and can be sent to a great distance without detriment if packed so aa 
to be kept cool. The red shrimps may be substituted for the brown, 
when they can be more easily procured. 

Obs. — Lobsters and shrimps, or prawns, in equal proportions, 
answer extremely well for bauainettes as for potting.

TO BOIL SHRIMPS OR PRAWNS. 

Throw them into plenty of fast boiling water, to which salt has 
been added in the proportion of from five to six ounces to the gallon ; 
take off aU the scum, boil the shrimps for five or ax minutes, or 
rather less should they be very small, and the prawns for about two 
minutes longer. The shrimpers* of the coast frequently cook them 
in sea-water, but the flavour is not then so agreeable as when fresh 
brine is used for them. They are always tmwholesome when not 
sufficiently boiled ; and even more so when they are stale. As soon 
as they are tender, drain them well in a cullender, and spread them 
out on a soft cloth to cool ; or dish them on a napkin, and send them 
hot to table when they are liked so. The large brown shrimps are 
considered the best, and they are more easier shelled than the red 
ones : these last, however, are sometimes prererred to them. Prawns, 
though superior to shrimps oxdy in size^ are always much higher 



Shrimps, 5 to 6 minutes if large. Prawns, 6 to 8 minutes. 

06«.— Ready-dressed shrimps or prawns may be preserved fit for 
eating at least twelve hours longer than they would otherwise keep, 
by throwing them for an instant into boiling salt and water, when 
they first b^in to lose their freshness, and then draining them as 
above. 

TO DISn COLD PRAWNS. 

When they are quite cold, dish them singly upon a very white 
napkin neatly arranged over a saucer or small basin reversed in a 
disn, and garnish the base with a wreath of curled parsley, or with 
small leaves of the purple endive. 

TO SHELL SHRIMPS AND PRAWNS QUICKLY AND EASILY. 

Thu, though a most simple process, would appear, from the manner 
in whidi it is performed by many people, to be a very difficult one ; 
indeed it is not unusual for persons of the lower classes, who, from lack, 
of a little skill, find it slow and irksome, to have resource to the dan- 
gerous plan of eating the fish entire. It need scarcely be remarked 
that reiy serious consequences may accrue from the shells being 
swallowed with them, particularly wnen they are taken in large quan- 
tities. Unless the fish be stale, when th^ are apt to break, they will 
quit the shells eadly if the head be held firmly m the right hand and 
the tail in the other, and the fish be straightened entirely, then the two 
hands pressed quickly towards each otner, and the shell of the tail 
broken by a sligbt vibratoiy motion of the right hand, when it will 
he drawn oiT with the head adhering to it : a small portion, only will 
then xemaio on at the other end, which can be removed in an instant

CHAPTER TV. 




ZHTBODUCTOBT EHMAltXg. 

Gkayibs are not often required 
either in great yariety, or in abun- 
dant ooantitiesiwhen only a moderate 
table IS kept, and a clever cook will 
manage to supply, at a trifling cost, 
all that is generally needed for plain 
GntTy Kettle. family dinners; while an unskilful 

or extravagant one will render them sources of unbounded expense.* 
But however small the proportions in which they are made, their 
quality should be particularly attended to, and they should be well 
adapted in flavour to the dishes they are to accompany. For some, 
a high degree of savour is desirable, but for fricassees, and other 
preparations of delicate white meats, this should be avoided, and a 
soft, smooth sauce of refined flavour should be used in preference ta 
any of more piauant relish. 

Instead of frying the infredienta for brown gravies, which is 
usually done in •common English kitchens, French cooks pour to them 
at first a small quantity of bquid, which is reduced by rapid boiling 
to what is technically called glaze ; particular directions for which 
will be found in the next receipt to this, and also at pages 10 and 104. 
When the glaze has acquired the proper colour, boiline broth should 
be added in small portions, and well ^aken round me stewpan to 
detach it entirely ; the meat may then be stewed gently for three or 
four hours with a few mushrooms, should they l^ at hand, a bunch 
of parsley, and some green onions, or with a Portugal onion instead. 

A thick slice or two of an unboiled ham, is an almost indispens- 
able addition to rich soup or gravy, and to supply it in the most 
economical manner, a large, highly cured one, or more, not over 

* We know of an instance of a cook who stewed down two or three pounds of 
beef to make grayy for a single brace of partridges ; and who complained of the 
meanness of her employers (who were by no means affluent) beoaue this was ob- 
Jectedto. 



<»AP. IT.] GEAVIE8. 95 

fatted, should be kept for the purpoee, and cat as Te(]|iiiied. The 
hones of undressed meat will supply almost, or qmte as good 
grsTy-stock as the meat itself^ if weu boiled do¥m, particularly ttiose 
of the loin, or neck of yeal ; and as the flesh of these may be dressed 
in many, ways adyantageously without them, the whole joint may be 
turned to excellent account by so dividing it 

The necks of poultry, with the feet properly skinned, a few herbs, 
a morsel or two of ham or of lean bacon, and such slight flavourings 
beside as the spice-box can supply, with a few drops of good mush- 
room catsup, will of themselves, if well managed, produce sufficient 
graiy to serve with the birds from which they are taken ; and if not 
wanted for the purpose, they should always be stewed down, or 
thrown into the stock pot, for which the shank bones of legs of 
mutton, and all trinmunffs of meats should likewise be reserved. 
Excellent broth for the side or for the needy, may also be made of 
them at little cost, when th^ are not required for other uses. 

To deepe n th e colour of gravies, the thick mushroom pressings 
of Chxjpter VIL, or a little soy (when its flavour is admissible), or 
cavice, or Harvey's sauce, may be added to it ; and for some dishes, a 
ghuB of daret, or of port wine. 

Yennicelli, or rasped cocoa-nut, lightly, and very gently browned 
in a small quantity of butter, will both tliicken and enridb them, if 
about an ounce of either to the pint of gravy be stewed gently in it, 
from half an hour to an hour, and then strained out. 

All the ingredients indicated at page 4, for giving consistency to 
soups, wiU answer equally for gravies, which should not, however, 
be too much thickened, particularly with the unwholesome mixture 
of flour and butter, so commonly used for the purpose. Arrow-root 
or rice-flour, or common flour gradually browned in a slow oven, are 
nrach better suited to a delicate stomach. No particle of fat should 
ever be perceptible upon them when they are sent to table; and when 
it cannot be removed by skimming, they should be allowed to become 
sufficiently cold for it to congeal, and be taken off at once without 
trouble. It may be cleared from such as have not been thickened by 
passing them through a closely woven cloth, which has previously 
been laid into, and well wrung from, some cold water. 

JEWISH SMOKED BEEF* 

(Extremely useful for giving flavour to soup and gravy ^ 

This beet of which we have more fully spoken in Chapter XXXIV., 
imparts a remarkably fine flavour to soup or gravy ; but great care 
must be taken in using it to cut quite away all the external parts 
which have been discoloured in the drying : the whole of the sunace, 
indeed, should be rather thickly pared off, or it will give a smoky 
taste to the gravy. An ounce or two of the lean thus cleared from 
the outaidei and from all akin and fat, and divided first mto thick

slices, and then into small squares, will flavonr a 'pint or more of 
stock of any kind : it may be added to the nieat in making Lieb^ 
gravy when it is first put into the stewpan. 

TO HEIGHTEN THE COLOUR AND THE FLAVOUR OF GRAVIES. 

This is best done by the directions given for making Espagiule. 
An ounce or two of the lean of unboiled ham, cut into dice and co- 
loured slowly in a small stewpan, or smoothly -tinned iron saucepan, 
with less than an ounce of butter, a blade of mace, two or tnree 
cloves, a bay-leaf, a few small sprigs of savoui^ herbs, and an eschalot 
or two, or about a teaspoonful of minced omon, and a little young 
parsley root, when it can be had, will convert common shin of beef 
stock, or even strong broth, into an excellent gravy, if it be gradually 
added to them after they have stewed slowly for quite half an hour, 
and then boiled with them for twenty minutes or more. The liquid 
should not be mixed with the other mgredients until the side of the 
stewpan is coloured of a reddish brown ; and should any thickening 
be required, a teaspoonful of flour should be stirred in well, and sim- 
mered for three or four minutes before the stock is added; the pan 
should be strongly shaken round afterwards, to detach the brownmg 
from it, and this must be done often while the ham is stewing. 

Ohs, — The cook who is not acouainted with this mode of preparing 
or enriching gravies, will do well to make herself acquainted with it ; 
as it presents no difficulties, and is exceedingly convenient and ad- 
vantageous when they are wanted in small quantities, very highly 
flavoured and well coloured. An unboiled ham, kept in cut, vriU be 
found, as we have already said, a great economy for this, and other 
purposes, saving much of the expnense commonly incurred for gravy- 
meats. As eschalots, when sparingly used, impart a much finer sa- 
vour than onions, though they are not commonly so much used in 
England, we would recommend that a small store of them should al- 
ways be kept. 

BARON LIEBEg's BEEF ORAYT. 

(Most excellent for hcukes^ minces, and other dUhes made of cold meai^ 

For particulars of this most useful receipt, for extracting all its 
juices from fresh meat of every kind in the best manner, the cook is 
referred to the first part of the chapter on soups. The preparation, 
for which minute directions are given there, if poured on a few bits 
of lean ham lightly browned, with the other ingredients indicated 
above, will be converted into gravy of fine flavour and superior 
quality. 

With no addition, beyond that of a little thickening and spice, it 
will serve admirably for dressing cold meat, in dl the usual fonns of

nourishing' as those of meat freshly cooked, and it may be economically 
made in small quantities with any tnmmings of undressed beef, mut- 
ton, or veal, mixed together, which are free from fat, and not sinewy: 
flavonr may be given to it at once by chopping op with them th« 
lean part only of a slice or two of ham, or of highly»cured beef. 

8HUr OF BEEF OTOCK FOB GBAYIE8. 

There is no better foundation for strong grayies than shin of beef 
Btewed down to a jelly (which it easily becomes), with the addition 
only of some spice, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a moderate pro- 
portion of salt; this, if kept in a cool larder, boiled softly for two or 
three minutes every second or third day, and each time put into a 
deaDy well-scalded pan, will remain good for many days, and may 
easily be converted into excellent soup or gravy. Let the bone be 
broken in one or two places, take ont the marrow, which, if not 
wanted for immediate use, should be clarified, and stored for future 
oecMsions ; put a pint and a half of cold water to the ponnd of beef, 
and stew it very gently indeed for six or seven hours, or even longer 
should the meat not then be quite in fragments. The bones of ciufs 
feet which have been boiled down for jelly, the liquor in which the 
head has been cooked, and any remains of ham quite freed from tho 
smoky parts, from rust, and fat, will be serviceable additions to this 
stock. A couple of pounds of the neck of beef may be added to six 
of the shin with very good effect ; but for white soup or sauces this 
is better avoided. 

Shin of beef, 6 lbs.; water, 9 pints; salt, 1 oz. ; large bunch of 
savoury herbs; peppercorns, 1 teaspoouful; mace, 2 blades. 

BICH PALE TEAL OEAYT, OB OONSOlOfE. 

The French, who have always at hand their stock-pot of good 
batdUan (beef soup or broth), make great use of it in preparing their 
graviefl. It is added instead of water to the fresh meat, and when 
this, in somewhat larger proportions, is boiled down in it, with the 
addition only of a bunch of parsley, a few green onions, and a mode- 
rate seasoning of salt, a strong and very pure-flavoured pale gravy 
is produced. When the best joints of fowls, or of partridges have 
been taken for fricassees or cutlets, the remainder may be stewed 
with a pound or two of veal into a eonsnmtniy which then takes 
the name of chicken or of game gravy. For a large dinner it is 
always desirable to have in readiness such stock as can easily and 
quickly be converted into white and other sauces. To make this, 
arrange a slice or two of lean ham in a stewpan or saucepan with 
three pounds of the neck of veal once or twice divided (unless 
the thick fleshy part of the knuckle cau be had), and pour tjo them

three fiill pinto of Btrong beef or real broth; or, if this cannot 
conveniently bo done, increase the proportion of meat or diminish that 
of the liquid, substituting water for the broth; throw in some salt 
after the boiling has commenced, and the gravy has been well skimmed, 
with one mild onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, a little celery, a car- 
rot, a blade of mace, and a half-saltspoonful of peppercorns; stew 
those very gently for four hours ; then, should the meat be quite in 
frngments, strain off the gravy, and let it become sufficiently cold to 
allow the fat to be entirely cleared from it. A handful of nicely pre* 
pared mushroom-buttons will much improve its flayour; and the 
bones of boiled calf's feet, or the fresh ones of fowls, will be found 
excellent additions to it. A better method of making it, when time 
and trouble are not regarded, is to heat the meat, which ought to be 
free of bones, quite through, with from a quarter to half a pint of 
broth only, and when on probing it with the point of a knife no blood 
issues from it, and it has been turned and equally doi\e, to moisten it 
with the remainder of the broth, which should be boiling. 

Lean of ham, 6 to 8 os. ; neck or knuckle of veal, 3 lbs. ; strong 
broth, 3 pints (or veal, 4 lbs., and water, 3 pinto); salt; bunch of 
savoury herbs ; mild onion, 1 ; carrot, 1 large or 2 small ; celery |

BIOH DEEP-OOLOUaED TEAL GBAYT. 

Lay into a large thick stewpau or saucepan, from half to three 
quarters of a pound ef undressed ham, freed entirely from fat, and 
from the smoked edges, and sliced half an inch thick ; on this place 
about four pounds of lean veal, cut from the best part of the knuckle 
or from the neck (part of the tillet, which in France is often used for 
it instead, not being generally purchasable here, the butchers seldom 
dividing the joint) ; pour to them about half a pint of good broth,* 
and place the pan over a brisk fire until it is well reduced; then 
thrust a knife into the meat, and continue the stewing more gently 
until a glaze is formed as we have described at page 10. The latter 
part of the process must be very slow ; the stewpan must be frequently 
shaken, and the gravy closely watched that it may not bum : when it 
is of a fine deep amber colour, pour in sufficient boiling broth to 
cover the meat, add a bunch of parsley, and a few mushrooms and 
green onions. A blade or two of maoe, a few white peppercoms, and 
a head of celery, would, we think, be very admissible additions to this 
gravy, but it is extremely good without. Half the quantity can be 
maiie, but it will then be raUier more troublesome to manage.

GOOD BEEF OR VEAL ORAYT. (ENGLISH RECEIPT.) 

Flour and try lightly in a bit of good butter a couple of pounds of 
either beef or yeal ; dndn the meat weU from the fat, and lay it into 
a small thick stewpan or iron saucepan ; pour to it a quart of boiling 
water; add, after it has been well skimmed and salted, a large mild 
onion sliced, very delicately fried, and laid on a sieve to drain, a car- 
rot also alioed, a small bunch of thyme and parsley, a blade of mace, 
and a few peppercorns ; stew these gently for three hours or more, 
peas the gravy throueh a sieve into a clean pan, and when it is quite 
cold clear it entirely from fat, heat as much as is wanted for table, 
and if not sufficiently thick stir into it from half to a whole teaspoon* 
ful of arrowroot mixed with a little mushroom catsup. 

Beef or veal, 2 lbs. ; water, 2 pints ; fried onion, 1 large ; carrot, 1 ; 
small bunch of herbs ; salt, 1 small teaspoonful or more ; mace, 1 
blade ; peppercorns, 20 : 3 to 3} hours. 

A RICH ENGLISH BROWN GRATT. 

Brown lightly and carefully from four to six ounces of lean ham, 
thickly slicai and cut into large dice ; lift these out, and put them 
into the pan in which the gniv^ is to be made ; next, fry lightly also, 
a couple of pounds of neck oi beef dredged moderately with flour, 
and slightly with pepper ; put this, when it is done, over the ham ; 
and then brown gently and add to them two or three eschalots, or a 
Portugal onion ; should neither of these be at hand, one not large 
common onion must be used instead. Pour over these ingredients a 
quart of boiling water, or of weak but well-flavoured broth ; bring the 
whole slowly to a boil, clear off the scum with great care, throw in a 
saltspoonfhl of salt, four cloves, a blade of mace, twenty corns of 
pepper, a bunch of savoury herbs, a carrot, and a few slices of celery : 
these last two may be fried or not as is most convenient. Boil tne 
gravy very softly until it is reduced to little more than a pint; strain, 
and set it by until the fat can be taken from it. Heat it anew, add 
more salt if needed and a little mushroom catsup, cayenne- vinegar, 
or whatever flavouring it may require for the dish with wHch 
it is to be served; it will seldom require any thickening. A 
dozen small mushrooms prepared as for pickling, or two or three 
morels, previously well washed and soaked, may be added to it at 
first witn advantage. Half this quantity of gravy will be sufficient 
for a single tureen, and the economist can diminish a little the pro- 
portion of meat when it is thought too much. 

PLAIN GRAVY FOR VENISON.

tet them over a clear fire, and let them brown a i.ttle in their own

Take off the scum, throw in a little salt, and boil tne gravy until 
reduced one halt Some cooks broil the cutlets lightly, boil the 
gravy one hour, and reduce it after it is strained. 

For appropriate gravy to serve with yenison^ see " Haunch of 
Venison/' Chapter XV. 

A RICH GRAVY POR VENISON. 

There are tew eaters to whom this would be acceptable, the gene- 
rality of them preferring infinitely the flavour of the venison itself 
to any which the richest gravy made of other meats can afford ; but 
when the flavour of a well-made EspagnoUia likely to be relished, 
prepare it by the receipt of the following page, substituting plain 
ttrong mutton stock for the veal gravy. 

SWEET SAUCE, OR GRAVY FOR VENISON. 

Add to a quarter-pint of common venison gravy a couple of glasses 
of port wine or claret, and half an ounce of sugar in lumps. Christo- 
pher North's sauce, mixed vrith three times its measure of gravy, 
would be an excellent substitute for this. 

ESPAGNOLE (SPANISH SAUCB). 

A higMyiflavoured Gravy, 

Dissolve a couple of ounces of ^ood butter in a thick stewpan or 
saucepan, throw in from four to six sliced eschalots, four ounces of 
the lean of an undressed ham, three ounces of carrot, cut in small 
dice, one bay leaf, two or three branches of parsley, and one or two 
of thyme, but these last must be small ; three cloves, a blade of mace, 
and a dozen corns of pepper ; add part of a root of parsley, if it be at 
hand, and keep the wnole stirred or shaken over a moderate fire for 
twenty minutes, then add bv decrees one pint of very strong veal 
stock .or gravy, and stew the whole gently from thirty to forty 
minutes ; strain it, skim off the fat, and it will be ready to serve. 

Butter, 2 oz. ; eschalots, 4 to 6 ; lean of undressed ham, 4 oz. ; 
carrots, 3 oz. ; bay leaf, 1 ; little thyme and parsley, in branches ; 
cloves, 3 ; mace, I blade ; peppercorns, 12 ; little parsley root : fried 
gently, 20 minutes. Strong veal stock, or gravy, 1 pint : stewed 
very softly, 30 to 40 minutes. 

ESPAGNOLE, WITH WINE. 

Take the same proportions of ingredients as for the preceding 
Espagnole, with the addition, if they should be at hand, of a dozen 
small mushrooms prepared as for stewing; when these have fried 
gently in the stewpan until it appears of a reddish colour all round, 
stir ia a tabiespoonful of floor, and when it is lightly browned, add 



CHAF. IV.] GRAVIES 101 

in amall portions, letting each one boil up before the next is poured 
in, and snaking the pan well round, three quarters of a pint of not and 
gwd yeal gravy, and nearly half a pint of Madeira or sherry. When 
the sauce has boiled gently for half an hour, add to it a small quan- 
tity of cayenne and some salt, if this last be needed ; then strain it, 
skmi off the fat entirely should an^ appear upon the surface, and 
serve it very hot. A smsller proportion of wine added a few minutes 
before the sauce is ready for table, would perhaps better suit with 
English taste, as with longer boiling its flavour passes off almost en* 
tiiely. Either of these Espagrioles^ poured over the well bruised re- 
mains of pheasants, partridges, or moor fowl, and boiled with them 
for an hour, will become most admirable game gravy, and would gene- 
rally be considered a superlative addition to other roast birds oftheir 
kind, as well as to the b^'.sh or salmi, for which see Chapter XV. 

Ingredients as in preceding receipt, with mushrooms 12 to 18 ; 
Madeira, or good sherry, i to | pint. 

JUS DES ROONONS, OR, KIDNEY ORAYY. 

Strip the skin and take the fat from three fresh mutton kidneys, 
slice and flour them ; melt two ounces of butter in a deep saucepan, 
and put in the kidneys, with an onion cut small, and a teaspoonful 
of fine herbs stripped from the stalks. Keep these well shaken over 
a dear fire until nearly all the moisture is dried up ; then pour in a 
pint of boiling water, add half a teaspoonful of salt, and a little cayenne 
or conunon pepper, and let the gravy boil gently for an hour and a 
faalf^ or longer, if it be not thick and rich. Strain it through a 
fine sieve, and take off the fat. Spice or catsup may be added at 
pleasure. 

Mntton kidneys, 3 ; butter, 2 oz. ; onion, 1 ; fine herbs, 1 tea- 
spoonful : I hour. Water, 1 pint ; salt, ) teaspoonful ; little cayenne, 
or black pepper : 1) hour. • 

ObM, — This is an excellent cheap gravy for haricots, curries, or 
bashes of mutton ; it may be much improved by the addition of two 
or three eschalots, and a small bit or two of lean meat. 

ORAYY IN HASTE. 

Chop fine a few bits of lean meat, a small onion, a few slices ol 
carrot and turnip, and a little thyme and parsley ; put these with half 
an ounce of butter into a thick saucepan, and keep them stirred until 
they are slightly browned ; add a little spice, and water in the propor- 
tion of a pint to a pound of meat ; clear the gravy from scum, let it 
boil half an hour, then strain it for use. 

Meat, lib. ; 1 small onion ; little carrot, turnip, thyme, and parsley ; 
batter, i oz. ; doves, 6 ; corns of pepper, 12 ; water, 1 pint: \ hour. 

CHEAP GRAYY FOR A ROAST FOWL. 

When there is neither broth nor gravy to be had, nor meat of 
wbidi either can be made, boil the neck of the fowl after having cut 



102 MODEBN COOKEKY. [chap. iv. 



it small, in half a pint of water, with any slight seasonings of spice 
or herbs, or with a little salt and pepper only ; it should stew very 
softly for an hour or more, or the quantity will be too much reduced. 
When the bird is just ready for table, take the gravy from the drip- 

Eing-pan, and drain off the fat from it as closely as possible ; strain tne 
quor from the neck to it, mixing them smoothly, pass the gravy 
again through the strainer, heat it, add salt and ^pper or cayenne, if 
needed, and serve it extremely hot. When this is done, the fowl 
should be basted with good butter only, and well floured when it is 
first laid to the fire. Many cooks always mix the gravy from the pan 
when game is roasted, with that which they send to table with it, as 
they think that it enriches the flavour ; but to many persons it is 
peculiarly distasteful. 

Neck of fowl ; water, | pint ; pepper, salt (little vegetable and 
spice at choice) : stewed gently, 1 nour ; strained, stirred to the gravy 
of the roast, well cleared from fat. 

ANOTHER CHEAP ORAYY FOR A FOWL. 

A little good broth added to half a dozen dice of lean ham, lightly 
browned in a morsel of butter, with half a dozen corns of pepper and 
a small branch or two of parsley, and stewed for half an hour, will 
make excellent gravy of a common kind. When there is no broth, 
the neck of the chicken must be stewed down to supply its place. 

GRAVY OR SAUCE FOR A GOOSE. 

Mince, and brown in a small saucepan, with a slice of butter, two 
ounces of mild onion, When it begins to brown, stir to it a tea- 
spoonful of flour, and in five or six minutes afterwards, pour in by 
degrees the third of a pint of good brown gravy ; let this simmer 
fifteen minutes ; strain it, bring it again to the point of boiling, 
and add to it a teaspoonful of made mustard mixed well with a glass 
of port wine. Season it with cayenne and pepper and saUy if 
this last be needed. Do not let the sauce botl alter the wine is 
added, but serve it very hot. 

Onions, 2 oz.; butter, 1^ oz. : 10 to 15 minutes. Flour, 1 tea-

MEAT JELLIES FOB FIBS AND SAUCES. 

A Teiy finn meat jelly is easily made by stewing slowly down equal 
parts of shin of beef, and knuckle or neck of vesJ, with a pint of cold 
water to each pound of meat ; but to give it flavour, some thick 
slices of lean unboiled ham should be added to it, two or three 
carrots, some spice, a bunch of parsley, one mild onion, or more, and 
a moderate quantity of salt ; or part of the meat may be omitted, and 
a calf's head, or the scalp of one, very advantageously substituted 
for it, though the flavouring must then be heightened, because, 
thongh very gelatinous, these are in themselves exceedingly insipid 
to the taste. If rapidly boiled, the jelly will not be clear, and it will 
be difficult to render it so without clarifying it with the whites of 
eggs, which it ought never to require ; if very gently stewed, on the 
contrary, it will only need to be passed through a fine sieve, or cloth. 
The fat must be carefully removed, after it is quite cold. The shin 
cf beef recommended for this and other receipts, should be from the 
middle of the leg of young heifer beef, not of that which is large and 
coarse. 

Middle of small shin of beef, 3 lbs. ; knuckle or neck of veal, 3 
lbs. ; lean of ham, i lb. ; water, 3 quarts ; carrots, 2 large, or 3 sniali; 
bunch of parsley ; 1 mild onion, stuck with 8 cloves ; 2 small bay- 
leaves ; 1 large blade of mace ; small saltspoonful of peppercorns ; 
Bait, I oz. (more if needed) : 6 to 6 hours' very gentle stewing. 

Obs. — A finer jelly may be made by using a larger proportion 
of veal than of beef, and by adding dear beef or veal broth to it in- 
stead of water, in a small proporiiun at first, as directed in the receipt 
for eonsommey see page 98, and by pouring in the remainder when 
the meat is heated through. The necks of poultry, any inferior 
joints of them omitted from a fricassee or other dish, or an old fowl, 
will further improve it much; an eschalot or two may at choice 
be boiled down in it, instead of the onion, but the flavour should 
be scarcely perceptible. 

A CHEAPER HEAT JELLT. 

One calf's foot, a pound and a half or two pounds of neck of veal or 
beef, a small onion, a carrot, a bunch of parsley, a little spice, a bit or 
two of quite lean ham, dressed or undressed, and five half pints of 
water, boiled ven/ slowly for five or six hours will give a strong, 
though not a highly-flavoured jelly. More ham, any bones of unboiled 
meat, poultry, or game will, in this respect, improve it; and the 
liquor in which fowls or veal have been boiled for table should, when 



104 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. iy. 

At hand, be used for it instead of water. These jellies keep much 
better and longer wlien no vegetables are stewed down in them. 

GLAZE. 

This is merely strong^ clear gravy or jelly boiled quickly down to 
tlie consistence of thin cream ; but this reduction must be carefully 
managed that the glaze may be brought to the proper point without 
being burned ; it must be attentively watched, and stirred without 
being quitted for a moment from the time of its beginning to thicken ; 
when It has reached the proper degree of boiling, it will jelly in 
dropping from the spoon, like preserve, and should then be poured 
out immediately, or it will burn. When wanted for use, melt it 
gently by placing the vessel which contains it (see article Glazing^ 
Chapter IX.) in a pan of boiling water, and with a paste-brush \Ay it 
on to the meat, upon which it will form a sort of clear varnish. In 
consequence of the very great reduction which it undergoes, salt should 
be added to it sparingly when it is made. Any kind of stock may be 
boiled down to glaze $ but unless it be Ktrong, a pint will afford but a 
spoonful or two : a small quantity of it, however, is generally suf- 
ficient, unless a large repast is to be served. Two or three layers 
must be given to each joint. The jellies which precede this will 
answer for it extremely well ; and it may be made also with shin of 
beef stock, for common occasions, when no other is at hand. 

ASPIO, OB CLEAB SAYOURT-JELLT. 

Boil a couple of calf's feet, with three or four pounds of knuckle 
of veal, three quarters of a pound of lean ham, two large onions, 
three whole carrots, and a large bunch of herbs, in a gallon of water, 
till it is reduced more than half. Strain it oflf ; when perfectly cold, 
remove every particle of fat and sediment, and put the jeily into « 
very clean stewpan, with four whites of eggs well beaten : keep it 
stirred until it is nearly boiling; then plice it by the side of the fire 
to simmer for a quarter of an hour. Let it hcttle, and pour it through 
a jelly-bag until it is quite clear. Add, when it first begins to boil, 
three blades of mace, a teaspoonful of white peppercorns, and suf- 
ficient salt to flavour it properly, allowing for the ham, and the 
reduction. French cooks flavour this jelly with tarragon vinegar 
when it is clarified ; cold poultry, game, fi^h, plovers' eggs trumes, 
and various dressed vegetables, with many other things often elabo- 
rately prepared, and highly ornamental, are moulded and served in it, 
especially at hirge dejeuners and himilar repasts. It is also much 
used to decorate raised pies, and hams ; and for many other purposes 
of the toble. 

Calf's feet, 2 ; veal, 4 lbs. ; ham, } lb. ; onions, 2 ; carrots, 3 ; 
herbs, large bunch; mace, 3 blades; white whole pepper, 1 teaspoon- 
ful ; water, 1 gallon : 6 to 6 hours. Whites of eggs, 4: 16 minutes.

Bom Jfaritf, or Water Bath. 



Thk difference between good 
and bad cookery can scarcely 
be more strikingly shown 
than in the manner in which 
sauces areprepared and served. 
If well made, appropriate to 
the dishes they accompany^ 
and sent to table with them as 
hot as pns&ihle, they not only 
gire a heightened relish to a 
dinner, but they prove that both skill and taste have been exerted in 
its arrangements. When coarsely or carelessly prepared, on the con- 
trary, as they too often are, they greatly discredit the cook, and are 
anything but acceptable to the eaters. Melted butter, the most 
common of all — the **one sauce of England" as it is called by 
foreigner:*, and which forms in reality the basis of a large number of 
those which are served in thid country — is often so ill prepared, being 
either oiled or lumpy, or composed principally of flour and water, 
that it says but little for the state of cookery amongst ns. We trust 
that the receipts in the present chapter are so far clearly given, that 
if strictly followed they will materially assint the learner in preparing 
tolerably palatable sauces at the least. The cut at the commencement 
of the chapter exhibits a vessel called a hain mai-ie, in which sauce- 
pans are placed when it is necessary to keep their contents hot with- 
out allowing them to boil: it b extremely useful when dinners are 
delayed after they are ready to serve. 

TO TBICKEN SAUCES. 

When this is done with the yolks of eggs, they should first be well 
beaten, and then mixed with a spoonful of cold stock should it be at 
Liuid, and with one or two of the boiling sauce, which should be 



106 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. v. 

stirred very quickly to them, and they must in turn be stirred briskly 
to the sauce, which may be held over the fire, and well siiaken for 
an instant afterwards^ but never placed upon it, nor allowed to 
boil. 

To the roux or French thickening (which follows), the gravy or 
other liquid which is to be mixed with it should be poured boiling 
and in small quantities, the saucepan being often well shaken rouodl 
and the sauce made to boil up after each portion is added. If this 
precaution be observed, the butter will never float upon the surface, 
but the whole will be well and smoothly blended : it will otherwise 
be difficult to clear the sauce from it perfectly. 

For invalids, or persons who object to butter in their soups or 
sauces, flour only mixed to a smooth batter, and stirred into the 
boiling liquid may be substituted for other thickening : arrowroot 
also used in the same way, will answer even better than flour. 

FRENCH THICKENINO, OB BROWN BOUZ. 

For ordinary purposes this may be made as it is wanted for use ; 
but when it is required for various dishes at the same time or for 
cookery upon a large scale, it can be prepared at once in sufficient 
quantity to last for several days, and it will remain good for some 
time. Dissolve, with a very gentle de^:ree of heat, half a pound 
of good butter, then draw it from the fire, skim it well, give time 
for it to settle, pour it gently from the sediment into a very clean 
frying-pan, and place it over a slow but clear fire. Put into a 
dredging box about seven ounces of fine dry flour ; add it gradually 
to the butter, shake the pan often as it is thrown in, and keep the 
thickening constantly stirred until it has acquired a clear light brown 
colour. It should be very .slowly and equally done, or its flavour 
will be unpleasant. Pour it into ajar, and stir a spoonful or two as 
it is needed into boiling soup or gravy. When the butter is not cla- 
rified it will absorb an additional ounce of flour, the whole of which 
ought to be fine and dry. This thickening may be made in a well- 
tinned stewpan even better than in a frying-pan, iind if simmered over 
a coal fire it should be placed high above it, and well guarded from 
smoke. 

•WHITE BOnZ, OB FRENCH THICKENINa. 

Proceed exactly as for the preceding receipt, but dredge in the 
flour as soon as the butter is in full simmer, and be careful not to 
allow the thickening to take the slightest colour: this is used for 
white gravies or sauces. 

SAUCE TOURNEE, OB PALE THICKENED GBAYT. 

Sauce tourn6e is nothing more than rich pale gravy made with 
veal or poultry (see Consomme^ Chapter IV,) and thickened with deli* 



«?flAP. T.] SAUCES. 107 

eate white roux. The French give it a flavonring of mushrooms and 
green onions, by boiling some of each in it for about half an hour 
before the sauce is served: it must then be strained, previously to 
being dished. Either first dissolve an ounce of butter, and then 
dredge gradually to it three-quarters of an ounce of flour, and pro- 
ceed aa for the preceding receipt ; or blend the flour and butter per- 
fectly with a knife before they are thrown into the stewpan, and keep 
them stirred without censing over a clear and gentle fire until they 
have shnmered for some minutes, then place the stewpan high over 
the fire, and shake it constantly until the roux has lost the raw taste 
of the flour ; next, stir very gradually to it a pint of the gravy, which 
should be boiling. Set it by the side of the stove for a few minutes, 
skim it thoroughly, and serve it without delay. 

Butter, 1 oz. ; flour, ) oz. ; strong pale gravy, seasoned with 
moshrooiEs and green onions, 1 pint. 

06*. 3. — With the addition of three or four yolks of very fresh 
eggs, mixed with a seasoning of mace, cayenne, and lemon-juice, this 
becomes Oerman sauce, now much used for fricassees, and other 
dishes ; and minced parsley (boiled) and chili vinegar, each in suf- 
ficient quantity to flavour it agreeably, convert it into a good fish 
sauce. 

BBCHAMEL. 

This is a fine French white sauce, now very much served at good 
English tables. It may be made in various ways, and more or less 
expensively ; but it should always be thick, smooth, and rich, though 
delicate in fiavour. The most ready mode of preparing it is to take 
an equal portion of very strong, pale veal gravy, and of good cream 
(a pint of each for example), and then, by rapid boiling over a very 
dear fire, to reduce the gravy nearly half;, next, to mix witn part 
of the cream a tablespoonful of fine dry flour, to pour it to the re- 
mainder, when it boils, and to keep the whole stirred for five minutes 
or more over a slow fire, for if placed upon a fierce one it would be 
Uable to bum ; then to add the gravy, to stir and mix the sauce per- 
fectly, and to simmer it for a few minutes longer. All the flavour 
siiould be given by the gravy, in which French cooks boil a handful 
of mushrooms, a few green onions, and some branches of parsley be- 
fore it m reduced: but a good bichamel may be made without 
tbem, with a strong eoruomme (see pale veal gravy, page 98) well 
reduced. 

Strong pale veal gjavy (flavoured with mushrooms or not), 1 
pint: reduced half. Rich cream, 1 pint; flour, 1 tablespoonful: 5 
minutes. With gravy, 4 or 5 minutes. 

Obg* — Velaute, which is a rather thinner sauce or gravy, is made by 
simply well reducing* the cream and stock separately, and theu 
mixing them together without any thickening. 



108 MODERN COOKEBY, [chap. t. 

BicHAMBL MAIORB. 

(A cheap White Sauce.) 

A good hkihamel may be made entirely without meat, when eoo* 
nomy is an object, or when no gravy is at hand. Put into a stewpan, 
or a well-tinned and thick saucepan, with from two to three ounces 
of butter, a carrot, and a couple of small onions, cut in slices, witli 
a handful of nicely-deaned mushroom buttons, when these last can 
be easily procured ; and when they have stewed slowly for half an 
hour, or until the butter is nearly dried up, stir in two tablespoonsful 
of flour, and pour in a pint of new milk, a little at a time, shaking 
the stewpan well round, that the sauce may be smooth. Boil the 
bechamel gently for half an hour ; add a little salt, and cayenne ; 
strain, and reduce it, if not quite thick, or pour it boiling to the 
yolks of two fresh ^gs. 

ANOTHER COMMON BECHAMEL. 

Cut half a pound of veal, and a slice of lean ham or smoked beef^ 
into small dice, and stew them in butter, with vegetables, as directed, 
in the foregoing receipt : stir in the same proportion of flour, then 
add the milk, and let the sauce boil very gently for an hour. It 
should not be allowed to thicken too much before it is strained. 

Ohs, — Common bSchamel^ with the addition of a spoonful of made- 
mustard, is an excellent sauce for boiled mutton. 

RICH MELTED BUTTER. 

This is more particularly required in general for lobster sauce, 
when it is to be served with turbot or brill, and for good oyster 
sauce. Salmon is itself so rich, that less butter is needed for it thau 
for sauce which is to accompany a drier fish. Mix to a very smootlx 
batter a dessertspoonful of flour, a half-saltspoonful of salt, and hall" 
a pint of cold water : put these into a delicately clean saucepan, witli 
from four to six ounces of well-flavoured butter, cut into small bits, 
and shake the sauce strongly round, almost without cessation, until 
the ingredients ai*e perfectly blended, and it is on the point of 
boiling ; let it simmer for two or three minutes, and it will be ready 
for use. The best French cooks recommend its not being allowed to 
boil^ as they say it tastes less of flour if served when it is just at tlio 
]x>int of simmering. 

Cold water, ^ pmt ; salt, ^ spoonful ; flour, 1 dessertspoonful : 3 to 
4 minutes. Butter, 4 to 6 oz. 

MELTED BUTTER. 

(A good common Receipt.) 

Put into a basin a large teaspoonful of flour, and a little salt, then 
mix with tnem very gradually and very smoothly a quarter of a pint 



CHAP. ▼.] SAUCES. 109 

of cold water; tarn these into a small clean sancepan, and shake or 
stir them constantly over a clear fire until they have boiled a couple 
of minutes, then add an ounce and a half of butter cut small, keep 
the sauce stirred until this is entirely dissolved, give the whole a 
minute's boil, and serve it quickly. The more usual mode is to 
put the butter in at first with the flour and water; but for inex- 
perienced or unskilful cooks the safer plan is to follow the present 
receipL 

Water, ipint; flour, 1 teaspoonful: 2 minutes. Butter, 1] oz.: 
1 minute. 

Ohs. — ^To render this a rich sauce, increase or even dovhle the 
proportion of butter. 

FRENCH MELTED BUTTER. 

Pour half a pint of food but not very thick, boiling melted butter 
io the well-beaten yolks of two or three fresh eggs, and stir them 
briskly as it is added ; put the sauce again into the saucepan, and 
shake it high over the fire for an instant, but do not allow it to boil 
or it will curdle. Add a little lemon-juice or vinegar, and serve it 
immediately. 

KORFOLK SAtrCE, OR RICH MELTED BUTTER WITHOUT FLOUR. 

Put three tablespoonsful of water into a small saucepan, and when 
it boihi add four ounces of fresh butter ; as soon as this is quite dis- 
solved, take the saucepan from the fire, and shake it round until the 
nuce looks thick and smooth. It must not be allowed to boil after 
the butter is added. 

Water, 3 tablespoonsful ; butter, 4 oz. 

WHITE MELTED BUTTER. 

Thicken half a pint of new milk with rather less flour than is di- 
rected for the common melted butter, or with a little arrowroot, and 
stir into it by degrees after it has boiled, a couple of ounces of 
fresh butter cut small ; do not cease to stir the sauce until this is 
entirely dissolved, or it may become oiled, and float upon the top. 
Thin cream, substituted for the milk, and flavoured with a few 
atrips of lemon-rind cut extremely thin, some salt, and a small quan- 
tity of pounded mace, if mixed with rather less flour, and the same 
proportion of butter, will make an excellent sauce to serve with 
fowls or other dishes, when no gravy is at hand to make white sauce 
in the usual way. 

BURNT OR BROWNED BUTTER. 

Melt in a frying-pan three ounces of fresh butter, and keep it 
stirred slowly over a gentle fire until il 13 of a dark brown colour ; 
then pour to it a couj^e of tablespoonsful of good hot vinegar, and 



110 MODERN COOKEBY. [chap. ▼. 

season it with black pepper and a little salt. In France this is a 
fS&vourite sauce with boiled skate, which is served with plenty of 
crisped parsley, in addition, strewed over it. It is also often poured 
over poached eggs there : it is called beurre noir. 
Butter, 3 oz. ; vinegar, 2 tablespoonsful ; pepper ; salt. 

CLARIFIED BUTTER. 

Put the butter into a veiy clean and well-tinned saucepan or 
enamelled stewpan, and melt it gently over a clear fire; when it just 
begins to simmer, skim it thoroughly, draw it from the fire, and let it 
stand a few minutes that the butter-milk may sink to the bottom ; 
then pour it clear of the sediment through a muslin strainer or a fine 
hair-sieve ; put it into jars, and store them in a cool place. Butter 
thus prepared will answer for all the ordinary purposes of cookery, 
and remain good for a great length of time. In France, large quan- 
tities are melted down in autumn for winter use. The clarified 
butter ordered for the various receipts in this volume, is merely dis- 
solved with a gentle degree of heat in a small saucepan, skimmed, 
and poured out for use, leaving the ^ick sediment behmd. 

YERT GOOD EGG SAUCE. 

Boil four fresh eggs for quite fifteen minutes, then lay them into 
plenty of fresh water, and let them remain until they are perfectly 
cold. Break the shells by rolling them on a table, take tnem off, 
separate the whites from the yolks, and divide all of the latter into 
(quarter-inch dice ; mince two of the whites tolerably small, mix thenx 
lightly, and stir them into the third of a pint of nch melted butter 
or of white sauce : serve the whole as hot as possible. 

Eggs, 4 : boiled 15 minutes, left till cold. The yolks of all, whites 
'of 2 ; third of pint of good melted butter or white sauce. Salt as 
needed. 

SAUCE OF TURKETS' EGGS. 

(Excellent,) 

The eggs of the turkey make a sauce much superior to th<)se of the 
common fowl. They should be gently boiled in plenty of water for 
twenty minutes. The yolks of three, and the whites of one and a 
half, will make a very rich sauce if prepared by the directions of the 
foregoing receipt The eggs of the guinea fowl also may be converted 
into a similar sauce with ten minutes* boiling. Their delicate siaa 
will render it necessary to increase the numb^ taken for it. 

COMMON EGG SAUCE. 

Boil a couple of eggs hard, and when quite cold cut the whites and 
yolks separately ; mix them well, put them into a very hot tnieeny

EGO SAUCE FOR CALF*8 HEAD. 

This is a provincial sauce, served sometimes -with fish, and with 
calfs bead likewise. Thicken to the proper consistence with flour 
and butter some good pale veal gravy, throw into it when it boils 
from one to two Targe teaspoonsml of minced parsley, add a slight 
squeeze of lemon -juice, a little cayenne, and then the eggs. 

Veal gravy, } pint ; flour, I4 oz. ; butter, 2 oz. ; minced parsley, 1 
dessertspoonful; lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful; little cayenne; ^gs, 
3 to 4. 

ENGLISH WHITE SAUCE. 

Boil softly in half a pint of well-flavoured pale veal gravy a few 
very thin strips of fresh lemon-rind, for just sufficient time to give 
their flavour to it; stir in a thickening of arrow-root, or of flour and 
batter, add salt if needed, and mix with the ^vy a quarter of a 
pint of boiling cream. For the best kind of white sauce, see bechamel. 

Good pale veal gravy, \ pint ; third of 1 lemon-rind : 15 to 20 
minutes. Freshly pounded mace, third of saltspoonful ; butter, 1 to

ipint 

TERT COMMON WHITE SAUCE. 

The neck and the feet of a fowl, nicely cleaned, and stewed down 
in half a pint of water, imtil it is reduced to less than a quarter of 
a pint, witn a thin strip or two of lemon-rind, a small blade of mace, 
a small branch or two of parsley, a little salt, and half a dozen corns 
of pepper, then strained, thickened, and flavoured by the preceding re* 
eeipt, and mixed with something more than half the quantity of cream, 
wiU answer for this sauce extremely well ; and if it be added, when 
made, to the liver of the chicken, previously boiled for six minutes in 
the gravy, then bruised to a smooth paste, and passed through a sieve, 
an excellent liver sauce. A little strained lemon-juice is generally 
added to it when it is ready to serve: it should be stirred very 
briskly in. 

DUTCH SAUCE. 

Pat into a small saucepan the yolks of three fteah eggs, the juice 
of a laige lemon, three ounces of Dutter, a little salt and nutmeg, and 
a wineglassful of water. Hold the saucepan over a clear fire, and 
keep the saoce stirred until it nearly boils : a little cayenne may be 
aided. The safest way of making all sauces that will curdle by being 
allowed to boU, is to pat them into a jar, and to set the jar over the 



112 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. t. 

fire in a flaneepfin of boiling water, and then to stir the ing^diento 
constantly until the sauce is thickened sufficiently to ser^e. 

Yolks of eg:g:s, 3 ; juice, 1 lemon ; butter, 3 oz. ; little salt and 
nutmeg ; water, 1 wineglflssful *. cayenne at pleasure. 

Obs, — A small cupful of veal gravy, mixed with plenty of blanched 
and chopped parsley, may be used instead of water for this sauce, 
when it is to be served wilh boiled veal, or with calf's head. 

FRICASSEE SAUCE. 

stir briskly, but by degrees, to the well-beaten yolks of two largre 
or of three small frefb eggs, half a pint of common English white 
sauce ; put it again into the saucepan, give it a shake over the fire, 
but be extremely careful not to allow it to boil, and just before it is 
served stir in a dessertspoonful of strained lemon-juice. When meat 
or chickens are fricasseed, they should be lifted from the saucepan 
with a slice, drained on it from the sauce, and laid into a very hot 
dish before the eggs are added, and when these are just set^ the sauce 
should be poured on them. 

BREAD SAUCE. 

Pour quite boiling, on half a pint of the finest bread crumbB, an 
equal measure of new milk ; cover them closely with a plate, and let 
the sauce remain for twenty or thirty minutes ; put it then into a 
delicately clean saucepan, with a small saltspoonful of salt, half 
as much pounded mace, a little cayenne, ana about an ounce of 
fresh butter; keep it stirred constantly over a clear fire for a few- 
minutes, then mix with it a couple of spoonsful of good cream, give ft 
a boil, and serve it immediately. When cream is not to be had, an 
additional spoonful or two of milk must be used. The bread used lor 
sauce should be sialej and lightly grated down into extremely small 
crumbs, or the preparation will look rough when sent to table. Not 
only the crust, but all heavy-looking or imperfectly baked portions of 
it, should be entirely pared off, and it should be pressed against the 
grater only so much as will reduce it easily into crumbs. When stale 
bread cannot be procured, the new should be sliced thin, or broken up 
small, and beaten quite smooth with a fork after it has been soaked. 
As some will absorb more liquid than others, the cook must increase 
a little the above proportion should it be needed. Equal parts of 
milk and of thin cream make an excellent bread sauce : more batter 
can be used to enrich it when it is liked. 

Bread-crumbs and new milk, each ) pint (or any other measure) • 
loaked 20 to 30 minutes, or more. Suit, small saltspoonful ; mace, 
half as much ; little cayenne ; butter, 1 oz. ; boiled 4 to 6 minutes* 
2 to 4 spoonsful of good cream (or milk) : 1 minute. Or : bread* 
crumbs, | pint ; milk and cream, each i pint ; and from 2 to 4 spoons- 
fal of either in addition. 



CHAP. T.l SAUCES 113 

Obi. — Yerj pale, strong yeal gravy is Bometimes poured on the 
bread crumbs, instead of milk; and these, after being soaked, are 
boiled extremely dry, and then brought to the proper consistence 
with rich cream. The gravy may be highly flaToured with mush- 
rooms when this is done. 

BREAD SAUCE WITH ONION. 

Put into a verr clean saucepan nearly half a pint of fine bread- 
crumbs, and the white part of a large mild onion cut into quarters; pour 
to these three-quarters of a pint of new milk, and boil them very 
gently, keeping them often stirred until the onion is perfectly tender, 
which will be in from forty minutes to an hour. Press the whole 
through a hair-siere, which should be as clean as possible ; reduce the 
sauce by quick boiling should it be too thin ; add a seasoning of salt 
and grated nutmeg, an ounce of butter, and four spoonsful of cream ; 
and when it is of a proper thickness, dish, and send it quickly to 
table. 

Bread-crumbs, nearly \ pint ; white part of 1 large mild onion ; 
new milk, i pint : 40 to 60 minutes. Seasoning of salt and grated 
nutmeg; butter, 1 oz. ; cream, 4 tablespoonsful : to be boiled till of a 
proper consistence* 

Obs. — ^This Ls an excellent sauce for those who like a subdued 
flaTour of onion in it ; but as many persons object to any, the cook 
should ascertain whether it be liked before she follows this receipt. 

COMMON LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Add to half a pint of good melted butter a tablespoonful of essence 
of anchovies, a small half-sal tspoonful of freshly pounded mace, and 
less than a quarter one of cayenne. If a couple of spoonsful of cream 
should be at hand, stir them to the sauce when it boils ; then put in 
the flesh of the tail and claws of a small lobster cut into dice (or any 
other form) of equal size. Keep the saucepan by the side of the fire

xDucli good melted butter as will supply the quantitr of sauce required 
for table, and if to be senred with a turbot or other large fish to » 
numerous company, let it be plentifully provided. Season it slightly 
with essence of anchovies, and well with cayenne, mace, and salt ; add 
to it a few spoonsful of rich cream, and then mix a small portion of 
it very gradually with the pounded coral ; when this is sufficientlj 
liquefied pour it into the sauce, and stir the whole well together ; put 
in immediately the flesh of the fish, and heat the sauce thoroughly by 
the side of the fire without allowing it to boil, for if it should do so 
its fine colour would be destroyed. The whole of the coral may be 
used for the sauce when no portion of it is required for other pur- 
poses. 

OBAB SAUCB. 

The flesh of a fresh welUconditioned crab of moderate sise is more 
tender and delicate than that of a lobster, and may be converted into 
an excellent fish sauce. Divide it into small flakes, and add it to 
some good melted butter, which has been flavoured as for either of 
the sauces above. A portion of the cream contained in the fish may- 
first be smoothly mingled with the sauce. 

GOOD 0T8TBB 8AUGK. 

At the moment they are wanted for use, open three dosen of fine 
plump native oysters; save carefully and strain their liquor, rinae 
them separately in it, put them into a very clean saucepan, strain the 
liquor again, and pour it to them; heat them slowly, and keep 
them from one to two minutes at the simmering point, without 
allowing them to boU^ as that will render them hard. Lift them out 
and beard them neatlv; add to the liquor three ounces of butter 
smoothly mixed with a large dessertspoonful of floar ; stir these with* 
out ceasing until they boil, and are perfectly mixed ; then add to them 
gradually a quarter of a pint, or rather more, of new milk, or of thiu 
cream (or equal parts of both), and continue the stirring until the 
sauce boils again ; add a little salt, should it be needed, and a small 
quantity of cayenne in the finest powder ; put in the oysters, and keep 
the saucepan by the side of the fire until the whole is thoroughly 
hot and begins to simmer, then turn the sauce into a well-heated, 
tureen, and send it immediately to table. 

Small plump oysters, 3 dozen ; butter, 3 oz. ; flour, 1 large dee. 
tertspoonful ; the oyster liquor ; milk or cream, full \ pint ; little 
salt and cayenne.

whole imtfl it boils, put in the oysters, and when they are quite heated 
timmgh send the sance to table without delay. Some persons like a 
little cayenne and essence of anchovies added to it when it is served 
with fish ; others prefer the unmixed flavour of the oysters. 

Oysters, 2 dosens; their liquor; melted butter, ^ pint. (Little 
cayenne and I dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies when liked.) 

SHRTMP SAUCB. 

The fish for this sauce should be very fresh. Shell quickly one 
pint of shrimps and mix them with half a pint of melted butter, to 
which a few drops of essence of anchovies and a little mace and 
cayenne have been added. As soon as the shrimps are heated through, 
dish, and serve the sauce, which ought not to boil after they are put 
in. Many persons add a few spoonsful of rich cream to all shell-iish 
sauces. 

Shrimps, 1 pint ; melted butter, f pint ; essence of anchovies, 1 tea- 
spoonful ; mace, i teaspoonful ; cayenne, very little. 

ANCHOVY SAUCB. 

To half a pint of good melted butter add three dessertspoonsAil of 
essence of anchovies, a quarter of a teaspoonful of mace, and a rather 
high seasoning of cayenne ; or pound the flesh of two or three fine 
mellow anchovies very smooth, mix it with the boiling butter, simmer 
these for a minute or two, strain the sauce if needful, add the spices, 
give it a boil, and serve it. 

Melted butter, i pint ; essence of anchovies, 8 dessertspoonsful ; 
jnaoe, i teaspoonful ; cayenne, to taste. Or, 3 large anchovies finely 
pounded, and the same proportions of butter and spice. 

CREAM SAUCE POR FISH. 

Knead very smoothly Uuxther with a strong-bladed knife, a ktr^e 
teaspoonful of flour with Uiree ounces of good butter ; stir them in a 
Tery clean saucepan or stewpan over a gentle fire until the butter is 
dissolved, then throw in a little salt and some cayenne, give the whole 
one minute's simmer, and add, veiy gradually, half a pint of good 
cream ; keep the sauce constantly stunred until it boils, then mix with 
it a dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies, and half as much chili 
Tinegar or lemon-juice. The addition of shelled shrimps or lobsters 
eat in dice, will convert this at once into a most excellent sauce of 
cither. Founded mace may be added to it with the cayenne; and it 
way be thinned with a few spoonsful of milk should it be too thick. 
Omit the essence of anchovies, and mix with it some parsley boiled 
Terr green and minced, and it becomes a eood sauce for poultry.

{English Receipt) 

For a rich sauce of this kind, mix a dessertspoonful of flour with 
four ounces of good hutter, but with from two to three ounces only for 
common occasions ; knead them together until they rettemble a smooth 
paste, then proceed exactly as f(»r the sauce above, but substitute good 
pale Teal graij, or strong, pure-flAvoured veal broth, or shin of beef 
stock (which if well made hiis little colour), for the cream ; and when 
these have boiled for two or three minutes "lii* ih a tabiespoonful of 
common vinegar and one of chili vinegar, with as much cayenne as 
will flavour the sauce well, and some salt, should it be needed ; throw 
in from two to three dessertspoonsful of finely-minced parsley, give 
the whole a boil, and it will be ready to serve. A tabit>spoonful of 
mushroom catsup or of Harvey's sauce may be added with the vinegar 
when the colour of the sauce is immateriaU It may be served with 
boiled calf's head, or with boiled eels with good effect ; and variooa 
kinds of cold meat and fi«h may be re-warmed for table in it, as we 
have directed in another part of this volume. With a little more 
flour, and a flavouring of essence of anchovies, it will make, without 
the parsley* an excellent sauce for these last, when they are first 
dressed. 

Butter, 2 to 4 oz»; flour, 1 dessertspoonful; pale veal gpravy or 
strong broth, or shin of beef stock, i pint; cayenne; salt, if needed ; 
common vinegar, 1 tablespoonful ; chili vinegar, 1 tablespoonfol.

VBENOH MAITBX D'HOTEL,* OB STEWARD'S SAUCE. 

Add to half a pint of rich, pale veal gravy, well thickened with the 
white rotix of page 108, a good seasoning of pepper, salt, minced parsley, 
and lemon-juice ; or make the thickening with a small tablespoonful 
of flour, and a couple of ounces of butter ; keep these stirred con* 
stautly over a very gentle fire from ten to fifteen minutes, then pour 
the gravy to them boiling, in small portions, mixing the whole well as 
it is added, and letting it boil up between each, for unless this be done 
the butter will be likely to float upon the surface. Simmer the sauce 
for a few minutes, and skim it well, then add salt should it be needed, 
a tolerable seasoning of pepper or of cayenne in fine powder, from 
two to three teaspoonsful of minced parsley, and the strained juice of 
a small lemon. For some dishes, this sauce is thickened with the 
yolks of eggs, about four to the pint. The French work into their 
bciuces generally a small bit of fresh butter just before they are taken 
from the fire, to give them mellowness : this is done usuailj for the 
Maitre d' Hotel Sauce.

place it upon the fire, and stir it without intermission until it is near 
the point of simmering ; but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle

OOOSEBERRT SAUCE FOR MACKEREL. 

Cut the stalks and tope from half to a whole pint of quite youngs 
gooseberries, wash them well, just cover them with cold water, 
and boil them very gently indeed, until they are tender; drain 
and mix them with a small quantity of melted butter, made with 
rather less flour than usual. Some eaters prefer the mashed goose- 
berries without any addition; others like that of a little ginger. 
The best way of making this sauce b to turn the gooseberries into a 
hair-sieve to drain, then to press them through it with a wooden 
sj>oon, and to stir them in a clean stewpan or saucepan over the fire 
with from half to a whole teaspoonful of sugar, just to soften their 
extreme acidity, and a bit of fresh butter about the size of a walnut. 
When the fruit is not passed through the sieve it is an improvement 
to seed it. 

COMMON SORREL SAUCE. 

Strip from the stalks and the large fibres, from one to a couple of 
quarts of freshly-gathered sorrel; wash it very clean, and put it into 
a well-tinned stewpan or saucepan (or into an enamelled one, which 
would be far better), without any water ; add to it a small slice of 
good butter, some ppper and «dt, and stew it gently, keeping it 
well stirred until it is exceedingly tender, that it may not bum; men. 
drain it on a sieve, or press the liquid well from it ; chop it as fine aa 
possible, and boil it again for a few minutes with a spoonful or two 
of gravy, or the same quantity of cream or milk, mixed with a half- 
teaspoonful of flour, or with only a fresh slice of good butter. The 
beaten yolk of an egg or two stirred in iust as the sorrel is taken 
from the fire will soften the sauce greatly, and a saltspoonful of 
pounded sugar will also be an improvement 

ASPARAGUS SAUCE, FOR LAMB CUTLETS. 

Green cut the tender points of some young asparagus into half-inch 
lengths, or into the size of peas only ; wash them well, then drain 
and throw them into plenty of boiling salt and water. When they 
are quite tender, which may be in from ten to fifteen minutes, turn 
them into a hot strainer and drain the water thoroughly from them |[

pnt them, at the instant of serving, into half a pint of thickened veal 
gravy (see iouce toumSe)^ mixed xnth the yolks of a couple of eggs, 
and well seasoned with salt and cayenne, or white pepper, or into an 
equal (quantity of good melted hutter : add to this last a squeeze of 
lemon-] nice. The asparagus will become yellow if reboiled, or if 
left long in the sauce before it is served.

CAPER SAUCE. 

Stir into the third of a pint of good melted butter from three to 
four dessertspoonsful of capers ; add a little of the vinegar, and dish 
the sauce as soon as it boils, keep it stirred after the berries are 
added : part of them may be minced and a little ehili vinegar sub- 
stituted for their own. Pickled nasturtiums make a very good sauce, 
and their flavour is sometimes preferred to that of the capers. For 
a large joint, increase the quantity of butter to half a pint. 

Melted butter, third of pint ; capers, 3 to 4 dessertspoonsful 

BROWN CAPER SAUCE. 

Thicken half a pint of good veal or beef gravy as directed for

Thickened veal, or beef gnvj, ^ pint ; capers, 2 tablespoonsful ; 
caper liquor or chili vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful. 

CAPER SAUCE FOR FISH. 

To nearly half a pint of very rich melted butter add six spoonsful 
of ttroRg veal gravy or jelly, a tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, 
and some chili vinegar or cayenne, and from two to three tablespoons- 
ful of capers. AVhen there is no gravy at hand substitute a half 
wineglassful of mushroom catsup, or of Harvey*8 sauce; though 
these deepen the colour more than is desirable. 

COMMON CUCUMBER SAUCE,

A170THEB OOMMON 8AU0E OF CUCmCBEBS. 

Cucumbers which have the fewest seeds are best for this saace. 
Pare and slice it€o or three, should they be small, and put them into a 
saucepan, in which two ounces, or rather more, uf butter have beea 
dissolved, and are beginning to boil; place them high over the fi.re, 
that they may stew as softly as possible, without t&ing colour, for 
three-quarters of an hour, or longer should they require it ; add to 
them a good seasoning of white pepper and some salt, when they are 
half done ; and just before they are served stir to them half a tea- 
spoonful of flour, mixed with a morsel of butter; strew in some 
minced parsley, give it a boil, and iiniBh with a spoonful of good 
yiuegar. 

WmTB OUCUMBEE SAUCE. 

Quarter some young quickly-grown cucumbers, without many 
seeds in them ; empty them of these, and take off the rinds. Cut 
them into inch lengths, and boU them from fifteen to eighteen minutes 
in salt and water; press the water from them with the back of a 
apoon, and work them through a sieve ; mix them with a few spoons* 
ful of bichamel, or thick white sauce ; do not let them boil again, but 
serve them venr hot. A sauce of better fiavour is made by boiling^ 
the cucumbers m veal gravy well seasoned, and stirring in the beateu 
yolks of two or three eggs^ and a little chili vinegar or lemon-juice, 
at the instant of serving. Another also of cucumbers sliced, and 
stewed in I utter, but without being at all browned, and then boiled 
in pale veal gravy, which must be thickened with rich creana, is 
excellent. A morsel of sugar improves thi# sauce.

tauee toumSe; when ther are tender add a few spoonsful of rich 
cream, gire the whole a boil, and serve it. Either of these sauces 
may be sent to table with boiled poultry, breast of veal, or veal«

Very small flaps, peeled and freed entirely from the fur, will 
answer for this sauce. Leave them whole or quarter them, and stew 
them tender in some rich brown gravy ; give a full seasoning of mace 
and cayenne, add thickening and salt if needed, and a tablespoonful of 
good mushroom catsup. 

COMMON TOMATA SAUCE. 

Tomatas are so juicy when ripe that they require little or no liquid 
to reduce them to a proper consistence for sauce ; and they vary so 
exceedingly in size and quality that it is difficult to give precise direc- 
tions for the exact quantity which in their unripe state is needed for 
them. Take off the stalks, halve the tomatas, and gently i>queeze 
out the seeds and watery pulp; then stew them softly with a few 
spoonsful of gravy or of strong broth until they are quite melted. 
Press the whole through a hair-sieve, and heat it afresh with a little 
additional g^^^vy should it be too thick, and some cayenne, and salt. 
Serve it very hot. 

Fine ripe tomatas, 6 or 8 ; gravy or strong broth, 4 tablespoons- 
ful : i to i hour, or longer if needed. Salt and cayenne sufficient 
to season the sauce, and two or three spoonsful more of gravy if 
required. 

Oba, — For a large tureen of this sance, increase the proportions ; 
and should it be at first too liquid, reduce it by quick boihng. When 
neither gravy nor broth is at hand, the tomatas may be stewed per- 
fectly tender, but very gently, in a couple of ounces of butter, with 
some cayenne and salt only, or with the addition of a very little finely 
minced onion ; then rubbed through a sieve, and heated, and served 
without any addition, or with only that of a teaspoonful of chili 
vinegMr ; or, when the colour is not a principal consideration, with a 
few spoonsful of rich cream, smoothly mixed with a little flour to

ceding receipt, with two or three sliced eschnlotA, four or five chilies or 
a capsicum or two (or iu lieu of either, with a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of cayenne pepper), a few small dice of lean ham, and half a cupful 
of rich gravy. Stir these often, and when the tomatas are reduced 

Soite to a smooth pulp, rub them through a sieve ; put them into a 
ean saucepan, with a few spoonsful more of rich gravy, or Espoff^ 
noltj add salt if needed, boil the sauce stirring it well for ten minutes, 
and serve it very hot. When the gravy is exceedingly good and 
highly flavoured, the ham may be otnitti*d: a dozen small mush- 
rooms nicely cleaned may also be sliced and stewed with the tomatas, 
instead of the eschalots, when their flavour is preferred, or they may 
be added with them* The exact proportion of liquid used is imma- 
terial, for should the sauce be too thin it may b^ reduced by rapid 
boiling, and diluted with more gravy if too thick. 

BOILED APPLE SAUCE. 

Apples of a fine cooking sort require but a very small portion of 
liquid to boil down well and smoothly for sauce, if placed over a 
gentle fire in a close-shutting saucepan, and simmered as noftlv as 
possible until they are well broken ; and their flavour is injured by 
the common mode of adding so much to them, that the greater part 
must be drained off again before they are sent to table. Pare the 
fruit quickly, quarter it, and be careful entirely to remove the cores ; 
put one tablespoonful of water into a saucepan before the apples are 
thrown in, and proceed, as we have directed, to simmer them until 
they are nearly ready to serve : fini^th the sauce by the receipt which 
follows. 

Apples, ) lb. ; water, 1 tablespoonful ; stewed very softly : 30 to 60 
minutes. 

Oha, — These proportions are sufficient only for a small tureen of 
the Kauce, and should be doubled for a large one. 

For this, and all other preparations, apples will be whiter if just 
dipped into fresh water the instant before the^ are put into the stew- 
pan. They should be quickly lifted from it, and will stew down 
easily to sauce with only the moisture which hangs about thenu They 
iihouid be watched and often gently aiirred, that they may be equally 
done. 

BASED APPLE SAUCE. 

(Good.) 

Pnt a tablespoonful of water into a quart basin, and fill it with 
good boiling apples, pared, quartered, and carefully cored; put a 



CHAP. T.J SAUCES. 125 

plate orer, and set them into a moderate oren for about an hour, or 
until tbej are reduced quite to a pulp ; beat them smooth with a 
clean wooden spoon, adding to them a little sugar and a morsel 
of fresh butter, when these are liked, though they will scarcely be 
required. 

The sauce made thus is far superior to that which is boiled. 
When no other oven is at band, a Dutch or an American one 
would probably answer for it ; but we cannot assert this on our 
own experience. 

Good boiling spples, 1 quart : baked 1 hour (more or less accord- 
ing to the quality uf the fruit, and temperature of the oren) ; bugar, 
1 ox.; batter, i oz« 

BBOWN APPLE SAUCE. 

Stew gently down to a thick and perfectly smooth marmalade, a 
pound of pearmains, or of any other well-flavoured boiling apples, 
in about the third of a pint of rich brown gravy : season the sauce 
rather highly with black pepper or cayenne, and serve it very hot. 
Gurry sauce will make an excelleut substitute for the gravy when 
a very piquant accompaniment is wanted for pork or other rich 
meat. 

Apples pared and cored, 1 lb. ; good brown gravy, third of pint 
i to 11 hour. Pepper or cayenne as needed. 

WHITB ONIOW SAUCE. 

Strip the skin from some large white onioufi, and after having 
taken off the tops and routs cut them in two, throw them into cold 
water as they are done, cover tbem plentifully with more water, and 
boil them very tender ; lift them out, drain, and then press the water 
thoroughly from them ; chop them small, rub them through a sieve 
or strainer, put them into a little rich melted butter mixed with a 
spoonful or two of cream or milk, and a seasoning of salt, give the 
saoee a boil, and serve it very hot. Portugal onions are superior to 
aoT others, both for this and for most other purposes of cookery. 

JTor the finest kind of onion sauce, see Soubise, which follows. 

BBOWN OBION SAUCE. 

Out off both ends of the onions, and slice them into a saucepan in 
which two ounces of butter have been dissolved ; keep them slewing 
gently over a clear fire until they are lightly coloured ; then pour to 
tbem half a pint of brown gravy, and when they have boiled until 
they are perfectly tender, work the sauce altogether through a strainer^

Prepare and boil from half to a whole pint of eschalots by the 
preceding receipt; unless very large, they will be tender in about 
fifteen minutes, sometimes in less, in which case the water must be 
poured from them shortly after it has been changed for the second 
time. When grown in a suitable soil, and cultivated with care, the 
eschalots are sometimes treble the size that they are under other cir- 
camstancea ; and this difference must be allowed for in boiling them. 
Drain them veUp and mix them with white sauce or gravy, or with 
good melted butter, and serve them very hot,

Pare one or two half-grown marrows and cut out all the seeds; 
take a pound of the vegetable, and slice it, with one ounce of mild 
onion, into a pint of strong veal broth or of pale gravy ; stew them 
very softly for nearly or quite an hour ; add salt and cayenne, or 
white pepper, when they are nearly done ; press the whole through 
a fine and delicately clean hair-sieve ; heat it afresh, and stir to it 
when it boils about ihe third of a pint of rich cream. Serve it with 
boiled chickens, stewed or boiled veal, lamb cutlets, or any other 
delicate meat. When to be served as a pur6e, an additional half- 
pound of the vegetable ma^^t be used; and it should be dished with 
small fried sippets round it. For a maigre di^h, stew the marrow 
and onion quite tender in butter, and dilute them with half boiling 
water and half cream«

mixed with a portion of crenm), add the turuips with a half-tea- 
fipoonful or more of salt, and when the whole ia well mixed and very 
hot, pour it over hoiled mutton, veal, lamb, or poultry. There should 
be sufficient of the sauce to cover the meat entirely ; * and when pro- 
perly miide it improves greatly the appearance of a joint. ^ A little 
cayenne tied in a muslin may be boiled in the milk before it is mixed 
with the turnips. Jerusalem artichokes make a more delicate sauce 
of this kind even than turnips; the weight of boih regetables most

OLITE BAUCB. 

Remore the stones from some fine French or Italian olives bj 
paring the fruit close to them, round and round in the form of a 
corkscrew: they will then resume their original shape when done. 
Weigh six ounces thus prepared, throw them into boiling water, let 
them blanch for five minutes ; then drain, and throw them into cold 
water, and leave them in it from half an hour to an hour, propor- 
tioning the time to their sal tn ess ; drain them well, and stew them 
gently from fifteen to twenty-five minutes in a pint of very rich 
brown gravy or Espagtiole (see Chapter IV.) ; add the juice of half 
a lemon, and serve the sauce very hot. Half this quantity will be 
sufficient for a small party. 

Olives, stoned, 6 oz. ; rich gravy, 1 pint : 15 to 25 minutes. Juice,

and sometimes with beef-steaks, and with btewed fowL 

CELERY SAUCE. 

Slice the white part of from three to five heads of young tender 
celery ; peel it if not very young, and boil it in salt and water for 
twenty minutes. If for white sauce put the celery, after it has been 
well drained, into half a pint of veal broth or gravy, and let it stew 
until it is quite soft ; then add an ounce and a half of butter, mixed 
wiih a dessertspoonful of flour, and a quarter of a pint of thick cream 
or the yolks of three e&;gs. The French, after boiling the celery, 
which they cut very small, for about twenty minutes, drain and chop 
it ; then put it with a slice of butter into a stew-pan, and season u 
with pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; they keep these stirred orer the fii« 

* The objection to maikiny a Joint with thU or sny other uuce is, that U 
speedily becomes cold when spread over its sarflwes a portion of It at '

for two or three minutes, and then dredge in a dessertspoonful of 
flour: when this has lost its raw taste, they pour in a sufficient 
quantity of white grary to moisten the celery, and to allow for 
twenty minutes' longer boiling. A very good common celery sauce 
is made by simply stewing the celery cut into inch-lengths in butter, 
until it h^ins to be tender ; and then adding a sinful of flour, 
which must be allowed to brovm a little, and half a pmt oigood broth 
or beef gravy, with a seasoning of pepper or cayenne. 

Celery, 3 to 5 heads : 20 mmutes. Veal broth, or gravy, { pint * 
20 to 40 minutes. Butter, 1| 02.; flour, 1 dessertspoonful; cream, 
i pint, or three yolks of eggs. 

WniTE CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

Strip the outer rind from six ounces of sound sweet chestnuts, then 
throw them into boiling water, and let them simmer for two or three 
minutes, when the second skin will easily peel ofi: Add to them three 
quarters of a pint of good cold yeal gravy, and a few strips of lemon 
rmd, and let them stew gently for an hour and a quarter. Press 
them, with the gravy, through a hair-sieve reversed and placed over 
a deep dish or pan, as they are much more easily rubbed through thus 
than in the uroal way : a wooden spoon should be used in preference 
to any other for the process. Add a little cayenne and mace, some 
salt if needed, and about six tablespoonsful of rich cream. Keep the 
sauee stirred until it boils, and serve it immediately. 

Chestnuts without their rinds, 6 oz.; veal gravy, f pint; rind of 
\ lemon : 1} hour. Salt ; spice ; cream, 6 tabkspoonsful. 

Oh9. — ^This sauce may be served ¥rith turkey, vrith fowls, or with 
stewed veal-cutlets. 

BUOWN CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

Substitute rich brown gravy for the veal stock, omit the lemon- 
rind and cream, hdghten the seasoninffs, and mix the chestnuts with 
a few spoonsful of ISspagnole or highly flavoured gravy, ailer they 
have been passed through the sieve. 

PARSLEY-GREEN, FOR COLOURING SAUCES* 

Gather a quantity of young parsley, strip it from the stalks, wash 
H very clean, shake it as dry as possible in a cloth, pound it in a 
mortar, press all the juice closely from it through a hair-sieve 
leversed, and put it into a clean jar ; set it into a pan of lH)iling 
water, and in about three minutes, if gently simmered, the juice will 
be poached sufficiently ; lay it then upon a clean sieve to drain, and 
it will be ready for use. 

Spinach-green, for which particular directions will be found at the 
eoDunencement of Chapter XXIV., is prepared in the same manner. 
The juice of various nerbs pounded together may be pressed from 
Uiem through a sieve and added to cold sauces.

130 HODEBN COOKEET. [chip, t. 



TO CRISP PARSLEY. 

Wash some branches of young parsley well, drain them from the 
^niter, and swing them in a clean cloth until they are quite dry ; 
place them on a sheet of writing paper in a Butch oven, before a 
brisk fire, and keep them frequently turned until they are quite 
crisp. They will become so in from six to eight minutes. 

FRIED PARSLEY. 

When the parsley has been prepared as for crisping, and is quite 
dry, throw it into plenty of lard or butter, which is on the point of 
boiling ; take it up with a skimmer the instant it is crisp, and drain 
it on a cloth spread upon a sieye reyersed, and placed before the 
£re. 

MILD MUSTARD. 

Mustard for instant use should be mixed with milk, to which a 
spoon^l or two of yery thin cream may be added. 

MUSTARD THE COMMON WAY. 

The great art of mixing mustard is to haye it perfectly smooth, and 
of a proper consistency. The liquid with which it is moistened 
should be added to it in small quantities, and the mustard should be 
well rubbed, and beaten with a spoon. Mix half a teaspoonful of 
salt with two ounces of the flour of mustard, and stir to them by 
de^ecs sufficient boiling water to reduce it to the appearance of a 
thick batter : do not put it into the mustard-glass until it is cold. 
Some persons like a nalf-teaspoonful of sugar in the finest powder 
mixed with it. It ought to be sufficiently diluted always to drop easily 
from the spoon ; ana to bring it to this state more than a quarter of 
a pint, and less than half a pint of liquid will be needed for foiDu: 
ounces of the best Durham mustar d. 

For Tartar mustard see Chapter YJl. 

FRENCH BATTER. 

(For frying vegetables^ and far appUy peachy or orange fritters.^ 

Gut a couple of ounces of good butter into small bits, pour on it 
less than a quarter of a pint of boiling water, and when it is dissolyed 
add three quarters of a pint of cold water, so that the whole shall 
not be quite milk warm ; mix it then by d^rees and very smoothly 
with twelye ounces of fine dry flour and a smaU pinch of salt if the 
batter be for fruit fritters, but with more if for meat or vegetables. 
Just before it is used, stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten to 
a solid froth ; but previously to this, add a little water should it 
appar too thick, as some flour requires more liquid than other to 
bnng it to the proper consistence ; this is an exce^lingly light crisp 
batter, excellent for the purposes for which it is named. 



CHAP, v.] SAUCES. 181 

Butter, 2 oz.; water, from $ to nearly 1 pint; little salt; flour, i

TO PKEPARE BREAD FOR FRYING FISH. 

Cut thick slices from the middle of a loaf of light stale bread, pare 
the crust entirely from them, and dry them gradually in a cool oven 
until they are crisp quite through ; let them become cold, then roll 
or beat them into nne crumbs, and keep them in a dry place for use. 
To strew over hams or cheeks of bacon, the bread should be left all 
night in the oven, which should be sufficiently heated to brown, as 
well as to harden it : it ought indeed to be entirely converted into 
equally-coloured crust. It may be sifted through a dredging-box 
on to the hams after it has been reduced almost to powder. 

BB0W19ED FLOUR FOR THICKENING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. 

Spread it on a tin or dish and colour it, without burning, in a gentle 
oren or before the fire in a Butch or American oven : turn it often, 
or the edges will be too much brovnied before the middle is enough 
80. This, blended with butter, makes a convenient thickening for 
soups or gpravies of which it is desirable to deenen the colour ; and 
it requires less time and attention than the French raux of page 10 

FRIED BREAD-CRUMBS. 

Grate lightly into very fine crumbs four ounces of stale bread, 
and s?iake them through a cullender ; * without rubbing or touching 
them with the hands. Dissolve two ounces of fresh butter in a 
frying-pan, throw in the crumbs, and stir them constantly over a 
moderate fire, until they are all of a clear golden colour ; mt them 
4)ut with a skimmer, spread them ^n a soft cloth, or upon white 
blotting paper, laid upon a sieve reversed, and dry them before the 
fire. They may be more delicately prepared by browning them in a 
gentle oven without the addition of butter. 

Bread, 4 oz. ; butter, 2 oz. 

FRIED BREAD FOR GARNISHING. 

Out the crumb of a stale loaf in slices a quarter of an inch thick ; 
form them into diamonds or half diamonds, or shape them with a 
paste-cutter in any another way ; fry them in fresh butter, some of a 
yeiy pole brown and others a deeper colour ; dry them wdl, and place 
them altematel V round the dish that is to be eamished. They may 
be made to adhere to the edge of the dish when they are required 
for ornament only, by means of a little flour and white of egg brushed 
over the ode which is placed on it : this must be allowed to dry 
besS&re they are aerred.

SUPERIOR MINT-SAUCE* 

(To serve with lamb.') 

The mint for this sauce should be fresh and young, for when old 
it is toUjg;h and indigestible. Strip the leaves from 3ie stems, wash 
them with great nicety, and drain them on a sieve, or dry them in a 
doth ; chop them very fine, put them into a sauce-tureen, and to 
three heaped tablespoonsflQ of the mint add two of pounded sugar ; 
let them remain a short time well mixed together, then pour to them 
gradually six tablespoonsful of good vinegar. The sauce thus made 
IS excellent, and far more wholesome than when a larger proportioa 
of vin^ar and a smaller one of sugar is used for it ; but, aner the 
first trial, the proportions can easily be adapted to the taste of the 
eaters. 

COMMON MINT-SAUCE. 

Two tablespoonsful of mint, one 2u9^etablespoonful of pale brown 
sugar, well mixed together, and a Quarter of a pint of vinegar, stirred 
until the sugar is entirely dissolveo. 

STRAINED MINT SAUCE. 

Persons with whom the mint in substance disagrees can have the 
flavour of the herb without it, hj mixing the ingredients of either oT 
the preceding receipts, and straining the sauce after it has stood for 
two or three hours ; the mint should be well pressed when this i» 
done. The flavour will be the more readily extracted if the mint 
and sugar are well mixed, and left for a time before the vinegar is

PINE HORSERADISH SAUCE. 
(7*0 serve with cdH roast^ stewed^ or hoUed heef^ 

The root for this excellent sauce should be young and tender, and 
mted down on a very fine bright grater, quite to a pulp, after it has 
been washed, wiped, and scrap^ free from the outer skm. We have 
given the proportions for it in the preceding chapter, but repeat 
them here. 

Horseradish, 2 heaped tablespoonsful ; salt, 1 moderate teaspoonflil ; 
rich cream, 4 tablespoonsful ; good ^dnegar, 3 dessertspoonsful (of 
which one may be chili vinegar when the root is mild.) 

When the other ingredients are smoothly mingled, the vinegar 
must be stirred briskly to them in very small portions. A few drops 
of garlic or shalot vinegar can be added to them when it is liked. 

COLD MAITRE d'HOTEL, OR 8TEWARD*S SAUCE. 

Work well together until they are perfectly blended, two or three 
ounces of good butter, some pepper, salt, minced parsley, and the 
strained juice of a sound lemon of moderate size. The sauce thus 
prepared is often put into broiled fish ; and laid in the dish under 
broiled kidneys, beef-steaks, and other meat. 

For 2 oz. butter, 1 heaped teaspoonful young minced parsley; 
juice of 1 lemon; 1 small saltspoonful salt; seasoning of white 
pepper. 

Ohs. — ^The proportion of parsley may be doubled when a larger 
ouantity is liked : a little fine cayenne would often be preferred to 
ue pepper. 

GOLD DUTCH OR AMERICAN SAUCE, FOR SALADS OF DRESSED 
YEOETABLES, SALT FISH, OR HARD EGOS. 

Put into a saucepan three ounces of good butter very smoothly 
blended with a quite small teaspoonful of flour, and add to them a 
large wineglassful of cold water, half as much sharp vinegar (or very 
fresh, strained, lemon-juice) a ndtspoonful of salt, and half as much 
cayenne in fine powder. Keep these shaken briskly round, or stirred 
over a clear fire, until they form a smooth sauce and boil rapidly ; 
then stir them verjr quickly to the beaten yolks of four fresh eggs, 
which will immediately give the sauce the consistence of cust^; 
pour it hot over the safad, and place it on ice, or in a very cool larder 
until it is quite cold : if properly made, it will be very thick and 
smooth, and slightly eetj as if it contained a small portion of isinglass. 
A dessertspoonful of parsley, — or of tarragon,-- can be mingled with 
it at pleasure^ or any flavour given to it with store-sauces which 
is liked. It converts flakes of salt-fish, sliced potatoes Tnew or old)« 
and hard eggs, into excellent salads. 



134 MODEBN COOKERY. fcHitP. Yi. 



ENGLISH SAUCE FOR SALAD, COLD MEAT, OR COLD FISH. 

The first essential for a smooth, well-made English salad dressing, 
is to have the yolks of the eggs used for it sufficiently hard to 
be reduced easily to a perfect paste. They should be boiled at least 
fifteen minutes, and should have become qtdte cold before they are 
taken from the shells; they should also be well covered with water 
when they are cooked, or some parts of them will be tough, and will 
spoil the appearance of the sauce by rendering it lumpy, unless they 
be worked through a sieve, a process which is always better avoided 
if possible. To a couple of yolks broken up and mashed to a paste 
with the back of a wooden spoon, add a small saltspoonful of ^t, a 
large one of pounded sugar, a few grains of fine cavenne, and a tea- 
spoonful of cold water ; mix these well, and stir to them by degrees a 
quarter of a pint of sweet cream ; throw in next, stirring the sauce 
briskly, a tablespoonful of strong chili vinegar, and add as much 
common or French vinegar as will acidulate the mixture agreeably. 
A tablespoonful of either will be sufiicient for many tastes, but it is- 
easy to increase the proportion when more is liked. Six tablespoons- 
ful of olive oil, of the purest quality, may be substituted ror the 
cream : it should be added in very small portions to the other ingre- 
dients, and stirred briskly as each is added until the sauce resembles 
custard. When this is used, the water should be omitted. The 

Siquancy of this preparation — which is very delicate, made by the 
irections just given — may be heightened by the addition of a little 
eschalot vinegar, Harvey's sauce, essence of anchovies, French mus- 
tard, or tarragon vinegar; or by bruising with the eggs a morsel of 
garlic, half the size of a hazel-nut: it should always, however^ 
be rendered as appropriate as may be to the dish with which it is to 
be served. 

Obs. 1. — As we have before had occasion to remark, garlic, when 
very sparingly and judiciously used, imparts a remarkably fine savour 
to a sauce or gravy, and neitner a strong nor a coarse one, as it does- 
when used in larger quantities. The veriest morsel (or, as the French 
call it, a mere soupgon) of the root, is sufficient to give this agreeable 
piquancy, but unless the proportion be extremely small, the effect will 
be quite different. The Italians dress their salads upon a round of 
delicately toasted bread, which is rubbed with ^lic, saturated with 
oil, and sprinkled with cayenne, before it is laid into the bowl : they 
also eat the bread thus prepared, but ynth less of oil, and untoasted 
often, before their meals, as a digester. 

Obs. 2. — French vinegar is so infinitely superior to English in. 
strength, purity, and flavour, that we cannot forbear to recommend, 
it in preference for the use of the table. We have for a long time 
past been supplied with some of most excellent quality (labelled. 
Vinaigre de jBordeaiix) imported by the Messrs. Kent & Sons, g§ 
Upton-on- Severn, who supply it largely, we believe, both to whole- 
sale and retul venders in town and country.

THE POET*S RECEIPT FOR SALAD.* 

** Two large potatoes, passed through kitchen sieve 
Unwonted softness to the salad give ; 
Of mordent mustard, add a single spoon, 
J>istrust the condiment which bites so soon ; 
But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault, 
To add a double quantity of salt ; 
Three times the spoon with oil of Lucca cro¥ni, 
And once with vinegar, procured from town ; 
True flavour needs it, and your poet begs 
The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs; 
Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl. 
And, scarce suspected, animate the whole ; 
And lastly, in the flavoured compound toss 
A magic teaspoon of anchovy sauce : 
Then, though green turtle fail, though venison *& tough. 
And ham and turkey are not boiled enough, 
Serenely full, the epicure may say — 
Fate cannot harm me, — I have dined to-day.** 

Two well-boiled potatoes, passed through a sieve ; a teaspoonful of 
mustard; two teaspoonsful of salt; one of essence of anchovy; about 
a quarter of a teaspoonful of very finely-chopped onions, well bruised 
into the mixture; three tablespoonsful of oil; one of vineffar; the 
yolks of two e^p, hard boiled. Stir up the salad immediate^ before 
dinner, and stir it up thoroughly.

fiAUCE MAYONNAISE. 

(For salads J cold mealfpordtry^JUh^ or vegetables,) 

This is a very fine sauce when all the ingredients used for it are 
good ; but it will prove an uneatable compound to a delicate taste 
unless it be made with oil of the purest quality. 

Put into a large basin the yolks only of two very fresh eggs, care- 
fully freed from specks, with a little salt and cayenne ; stir these well 
together, then add about a teaspoonful of the purest salad oil, and 
work the mixture round with a wooden spoon until it appears like 
cream. Four in by slow degrees nearly half a pint of oil, continuing 

• Note. — This receipt, though long privately circulated amongst the fi-iends 
and acquaintance of its distinguished and regretted author, now (with permis- 
aion) appears for the first time in print. We could not venture to deviate by a 
word fntvn the original, but we would suggest, that the mixture forms almost a 
tubstitute for aalad, instead of a mere dressing. It is, however, an admirable 
compoiind for those to whom the slight flavouring of onion is not an objection.

nt each interval to work the sauce as at first until it resumes the 
smoothness of cream, and not a particle of the oil remains visible ; 
then add a couple of tablespoonsful of plain French or of tarragon 
vinegar, and one of cold water to whiten the sauce. A bit of clear 
veal jelly the size of an egg will improve it greatly. The reader who 
may have a prejudice agamst the unboiled eggs which enter into the 
composition of the Mayonnaise, will find that the most fastidious taste 
would not detect their being raw, if the sauce be well made; and per- 
sons who dislike oil may partake of it in this form, without bein^ 
aware of its presence, provided always that it be perfectly fresh, and 
pure in flavour, for otherwise it will be easily perceptible. 

Yolks of fresh unboiled eggs, 2; salt, ^ ^tspoonful, or rather 
more ; cayenne ; oil, full third of pint ; French or tarragon vinegar,

RED OR GREEN MAYONNAISE SAUCE. 

Colour may be given cither to the preceding or to the following 
Sauce Mayonnaise by mingling with it some hard lobster-coral reduced 
to powder by rubbing it through a very fine hair -sieve : the red hue 
of this is one of the most brilliant and beautiful that can be seen, but 
the sauce for which it is used can only be appropriately served with 
fish or fish -salads. Spinach-green will impart a fine tint to any pre- 
paration, but its flavour is objectionable : that of parsley -green is 
more agreeable. Directions for both of these are contained in the 
previous chapter. 

IMi'ERIAl* B1AY0NNAI8E. 

(An elegant jellied scucef or salad-dressing,) 

Put into a bowl half a pint of aspiCy or of any very dear pale 
jellied stock (that made usually for good white soup will 8er\'e for the 
purpose excellently) ; add to it a couple of spoonsful of the purest 
olive-oil, one of sharp vinegar, and a little fine salt and cayenne. Break 
up the jelly quite small with the points of a whisk of osier-twigs, 
stir the ingredients well together, and then whisk them gently until 
they are converted into a smooth white sauce. Thb receipt was de- 
rived originally from an admirable French cook,* who stood quite at 
the head of his profession ; but as he was accustomed to purvey for 
the tables of kings and emperors, his directions require some curtail- 
ment and simplilying to adapt them to the resources of common 
English life, lie directs the preparation to be mixed and worked — 
to use a technical expression — over ice, which cannot always be com- 
manded, except in opulent establishments, and in large towns. It is

lished thirty years or oiore since, all modem cooks appear to be spedaUy indebted.

not, however, essential to the success of this sauce, which will prove 
extremely good if made and kept in a cool larder ; or, if the bowl in 
which it is mingled be placed in a pan of cold water, into which 
plenty of saltpetre and sal-ammoniac, roughly powdered, are thrown 
at the moment it is set into it. In this country a smaller proportion 
of oil, and a larger one of acid, are usually preferred to the common 
French salad-di^ings, in which there is generally a very small por- 
tion of vinegar. To some tastes a spoonful or two of cream would 
improve the present Mayonnaise, which may be varied also with chili, 
tarragon, or other flavoured vinegar. It should be served heaped 
high in the centre of the salad, for which, if large, double the quan« 
tity directed here should be prepared. 

REMOULADE. 

This differs little from an ordinary English salad-dressing. Found 
very smoothly indeed the yolks of two or three hard-boiled eggs with 
a teaspoonful of mustard, half as much salt, and some cavenne, or 
white pepper. Mix gradually with them, working the whole well 
together, two or three tablespoonsful of oil and two of vinegar. 
Should the sauce be curdled, puur it by degrees to the yolk of a raw 
€^, stirring it well round as directed for the Mayonnaise. A spoon- 
ful of tarrafron, cucumber, or eschalot-vin^^r, may be added with 
very good effect ; and to give it increased relish, a teaspoonful of 
cavice, or a little of flarvey*s sauce, and a dessertspoonful of chili 
vinegar may be thrown into it. This last is an exceflent addition to 
all cold sauces, or salad-dressings. 

Hard yolks of 2 or of 3 eggs ; mustard, 1 teaspoonful (more when 
liked) ; salt, | teaspoonful : pepper or cayenne ; oil, 3 tablespoonsful ; 
vinegar, 2. If cunlled, yolk of 1 raw egg. Good additions : tarragon 
or eschalot, or cucumber- vinegar, I tablespoonful ; chili vinegar, 1 
dessertspoonful ; cavice or Harvey's sauce at pleasure. 

Ohe. — A dessertspoonful of eschalots, or a morsel of garlic, very 
finely minced, are sometimes pounded with the yolks of eggs for this 



OXFORD DRAWN SAUCE. 

Mingle thoroughly a tablespoonful of brown sugar with a tea- 
nioonful of made mustard, a third as much of salt, some pepper, 
from three to four tablespoonsful of very fine salad-oil, and two of 
strong vinegar; or apportion the same ingredients otherwise to the 
taste. 

FORCED EGGS FOR GARNISHING SALAD. 

Found and press through the back of a hair-sieve the flesh of three 
very fine, or of four moderate-sized anchovies, freed from the bones 
jnd skin. Boil six fresh eggs for twelve minutes, and when they are 



138 MODERN GOOKEBT. [chap. yz. 

perfectly cold, halve them len^hwise, take out the yolks, pound 
them to a paste with a third of tneir volume of fresh hutter, then add 
the anchovies, a quarter of a teaspoonful of mace, and as much 
cayenne as will season the mixture well ; heat these together tho- 
roughly, and fill the whites of egg neatly with them. A morsel of 
garfic, perfectly hlended with the other ingredients, would to some 
tastes improve this preparation : a portion of anchovy-hutter, or of 
potted ham, will supply the place of fish in it very advantageou^y. 

^&5^t 6 ; anchovies, 4; hutter, size of 2 yolks; mace, i teaspoonful; 
cayenne, third as much. 

ANCHOVY BUTTER. 

(^Excellent.) 

Scrape the skin quite clear from a dozen fine mellow anchovies, 
free the flesh entirely from the hones, and pound it as smooth as pos- 
sihle in a mortar ; ruh it through the hack of a hair-sieve with a 
wooden spoon; wipe out the mortar, and put hack the anchovies 
with three quarters of a pound of very fresh hutter, a small half- 
saltspoonful of cayenne, and more than twice as much of finely grated 
nutmeg, and freshly pounded mace; and beat them together until 
they are thoroughly blended. If to serve cold at table, mould the 
butter in small shapes, and turn it ont. A little rose pink (which is 
sold at the chemists*) is sometimes used to give it a fine colour, but it 
must be sparingly used, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour, and 
we cannot much recommend its use : it should be well pounded, and 
very equally mixed with it. For kitchen use, press the butter down 
into jars or pattypans, and keep it in a* cool place. 

Fine anchovies, 12 ; butter, | lb. ; cayenne, small \ saltspoonful ; 
nutmeg and mace, each more than twice as much ; rose pink (if used)^ 
i teaspoonful. 

This proportion difiers from potted anchovies only in the larger pro- 
portion of butter mixed with the fish, and the milder seasoning of 
spice. It will assist to form an elegant dish if made into pats, and 
stamped with a tasteful impression, then placed alternately with pats 
of lobster-butter, and decorated with light foliage. It is generally 
eaten with much relish when carefully compounded, and makes ex- 
cellent sandwiches. To convert it into a good fish sauce, mix two or 
three ounces of it with a teaspoonful of flour and a few spoonsful of 
cold water, or of pale veal stock, and keep them constantly stirred 
until they boil. The butter should not be moulded directly it is 
taken from the mortar, as it is then very soft from the beating. It 
should be placed until it is firm in a very cool place or over toe, when 
it can be done conveniently. 

LOBSTER BUTTER. 

Pound to the smoothest possible paste the coral of one or two fresh 
hen lobsters, mix with it ahsut an equal proportion of fresh firm but* 



CHAP. TJ.J COLD SAUCES, SALADS, ETC. 13^ 

ter, and a moderate seaso&iiig of mace and cayenne, witl a little salt 
if needed. Let the whole be thoroughly blended, and set it aside in 
a cool larder, or place it over ice until it is su£Sciently firm to be 
made into pats. Serve it garnished with curled pax^ey, or with any 
light foliage which will contrast well with its brilliant colour. The 
eraral may be rubbed through a fine sieve before it is put into the 
mortar, and will then require but little pounding. 

An excellent preparation is produced bv mingling equal propor- 
tions of lobster and of anchovy butter in the mortar, or one- third of 
the anchovy with two of lobster : to this some of the white flesh of 
the latter can be added to give another variety, after it has been 
prepared by the receipt for wtudirettesy Chapter III. 

TBTJFFLED BUTTER (AND TRUFFLES POTTED IN BUTTER.) 

(For the breakfast or luncheon table,) 

Cut up a pound of sweet fresh butter, and dissolve it gently over a 
dear fire ; take off the scum which will gather thickly upon it, and 
when it has simmered for three or four minutes, draw it from the fire, 
and let it stand until all the butter-milk has subsided ; pour it softly 
£rom this upon six ounces of ready-pared sound French truffles, cut 
into small, but rather thick, slices, and laid into a delicately clean 
enameUed saucepan ; add a full seasoning of freshly pounded mace 
and fine cayenne, a small saltspoonful of salt, and naif a not large 
nutmeg. When the butter has become quite cold, proceed to heat the 
truffles slowly, shaking the saucepan ouen briskly round, and steAv 
them as gently as possible for twenty minutes, or longer should they 
not then be very tender. If allowed to heat, and to boil quickly, 
th^ will become hard, and the preparation, as regards the truffles, 
will be a comparative failure. Lift them with a spoon into quite 
dry earthen or china pans, and pour the butter on them ; or add to 
them sufficient of it only to cover them well and to exclude the air, 
and pot the remainder of the butter apart : it will be finely flavoured, 
and may be eaten by delicate persons to whom the truffle itself would 
be injurious. It may also be used in compounding savoury sauces, 
and for moistening small croustades before they are fried or baked. 
The truffles themselves will remain good for months when thus pre- 
pared, if kept free from damp ; and in flavour they will be found ex- 
cellent. The parings taken from them will also impart a very agree- 
able savour to the butter, and will serve extremelv well for it for im- 
mediate use. They will also be valuable as additions to gravies or to 
soup. 

We should observe, that the juice which will have exuded from 
the truffles in the stewing will cause the preparation to become 
mouldy, or otherwise injure it, if it be put into the pans either with 
them or with the butter. The truffles must be well drained from it 
when they are taken from the saucepan, and the butter must remain 



140 l^IODEBN COOKERT. [cH4F. VL 

undisturbed for a few minutes, when it can be poured clear from the 
juice, which will have subsided to the bottom of the pan. We have 
given here the result of our first experiment, which we found on 
further trial to answer perfectly. 

ENGLISH SALADS. 

The herbs and vegetables for a salad cannot be too freshly &;athcred i 
they should be carefully cleared from insects and washed with scrupu- 
lous ni-ety ; they are better when not prepared until near the time of 
sending tnem to table, and should not be sauced until the instant 
before they are served. Tender lettuces, of which the stems should 
be cut off, and the outer leaves be stripped away, mustard and cress, 
young radishes, and occasionally chives or small green onions (when 
the taste of a party is in favour of these last) are tne usual ingredients 
of summer salads. (In early spring, as we have stated in another 
chapter, the young white leaves of tne dandelion will supply a very 
wholesome and excellent salad, of which the slight bittemesss is to 
many persons as agreeable as that of the endive.) Half-grown cu- 
cumbers sliced thin, and mixed with them, are a favourite addition 
with many persons. In England it is customary to cut the lettuces 
extremely tine ; the French, who object to the flavour of the knifey 
which they fancy this mode imparts, break them small instead. 
Young celery alone, sliced and dressed with a rich salad mixture, is 
excellent : it is still in some families served thus always with roast 
pheasants. 

Beet-root, baked or boiled, blanched endive, small salad-herbs 
which are easily raised at any time of the year, celery, and hardy let- 
tuces, with any ready-dressed vegetable, will supply salads through 
the winter. Cucumber vinegar is an agreeable addition to these. 

FRENCU SALAD. 

In winter this is made principally of beautifully-blanched endive, 
washed delicately clean and broken into small branches with the 
fingers, then taken from the water and shaken dry in a basket of 
peculiar form, appropriated to the purpose,* or in a fine cloth ; then 
arranged in the salad bowl, and strewed with herbs (tarragon 
generally, when in season) minced small : the dressing is not added 
until just before the salad is eaten. In summer, young lettuces are 
substituted for the endive, and intermixed with a vanety of herbs^ 
some of which are not generally cultivated in England. 

FRENCH SALAD DUESSIKG. 

Stir a saltspoonful of salt and half as much pepper into a large 
spoonful of ou, and when the salt is dissolved, mix with them four

are not in such general use here an on the ouutinenu

additional spoonsful of oD, and pour the whole over the salad ; let it 
be well turned, and then add a couple of spoonsful of tarragon vinegar j 
mix the whole thoroughly, and. serve it without delay. The ^ad 
should not be dressed in this way until the instant before it is wanted 
for table : the proportions of salt and pepper can be increased at 
pleasure, and common or cucumber vinegar may be substituted for the 
tarragon, which, however, is more fiequently used in France than 
any other. 

Salt, 1 spoonful : pepper, | as much ; oil, 5 saladspoonsful ; tar- 
ragon, or other vinegar, 2 spoonsfuL 

DE8 CERNEAUX, OK WALNUT 8AL\D. 

This is a common summer salad in France, where the growth of 
walnuts is generally abundant, but is not much served in England ; 
though the sweet flavour of the just-formed nut is very agreeable. 
Take the walnuts when a pin will pierce them easily^ pare them down 
to the kernels, and toss them gently, just before they are served, in a 
French or English salad-dressing (the former would generally be 
preferred we tmnk), and turn them into the salad-bowl for tabic. 

SUFFOLK SALAD, 

Fill a salad-bowl from half to three parts full with very tender 
lettuces shred small, minced lean of ham, and hard-boiled eggs, or 
their yolks only also minced, placed in alternate layers ; dr^ the 
mixture with English salad sauce, but do not pour it into the bowl 
until the instant of serving. A portion of cold chicken (or veal), 
cut in thin slices about the size of a shilling, may be added when 
convenient ; the ham and eggs also may be sliced instead of being 
minced, and the whole neatly arranged in a chain or otherwise round 
the inside of the bowL 

YORESHIRB PLOUGHMAN*S SALAD. 

Mix treacle and vinegar, in the proportion of one tablespoonful of 
the first to two of the latter: add a little black pepper, and eat the 
sauce with lettuces shred small (with an intermixture of young onions 
when they are liked). 

AN EXCELLENT SALAD OP YOUNQ VEGETABLES. 

Pare off the coarse, fibrous parts from four or five artichoke 
bottoms, boiled quite tender, well drained, and freed carefully 
finvm the insides; cut them into quarters, and lay them into the 
salad-bowl; arrange over them some cold new potatoes and 
young carrots sli(^ moderately thin, strew minced tarragon 
chervil, or any other herbs which may be better liked, thicldy 



142 MODERN COOKEBT. [cHAr. YL 

over the surface, and sauce the salad with an English or Preach 
dressing just before it is sent to table. Very young fxench beans cut 
into short lozenge-shaped lengths, or asparagus points, can be added 
to this dish at pleasure; or small tufts of cauliflower may be placed 
round it. When these additions are made, the herbs are better 
omitted : a little of the liquor of pickled Indian mangoes may be 
advantageously mixed with the sauce for this salad, or in lieu of it 
some chili vinegar or cayenne pepper. The Dutch or American 
sauce of the previous pages would also make an appropriate dressing 
for it. 

SORREL SALAD* 

(To serve with Lamh-ctUlets^ VeaUcutteU^ or Roast Lamb). 

This, though a very agreeable and refreshing salad, is not to be re- 
commended when there is the slightest tendency to disorder of the 
system ; for the powerful acid of the uncooked sorrel might in that 
case produce serious consequences.* 

Take from the stems some very young tender sorrel, wash it deli- 
cately clean, drain it well, and shake it dry in a salad-basket, or in a 
soft cloth held by the four comers ; arrange it lightly in the bowl, 
and at the instant of serving, sauce it simply with the preceding 
French dressing of oil with a small portion of vinegar, or with a 
Mayonnaise mixed with chili instead of a milder vinq|;ar. The sorrel 
may be divided with the fingers and mingled with an equal propor- 
'tion of very tender lettuces ; and, when it is not objected to,f mixed 
tarragon may be strewed thickly upon them. To some tastes a small 
quantity of green onions or of eschalots would be more agreeable. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

First, prepare a sauce with the coral of a hen lobster, pounded 
and rubbed through a sieve, and very gradually mixed with a good 
mayonnaise, remoulade, or English salad-dressmg of the present 
chapter. Next, half fill the bowl or more with small salad herbs, or 
with young lettuces finely shred, and arrange upon them spirally, or 
in a chain, alternate slices of the fiesh of a large lobster, or of two 
middling-sized ones, and some hard-boiled eggs cut thin and evenly. 
Leave a space in the centre, pour in the sauce, heap lightly some small 
salad on the top, and send tne dish immediately to table. The coral 
of a second lobster may be intermingled with the white flesh of the

lar nature, are prevalent. We mention this, hecanse if more general preeaation 
were observed with regard to diet, great suffering would, in many instanoes, be 
avoided. 

f The peculiar flavour of this fine aromatic herb is less generally relished in 
EngUnd than in many other countries ; but when it is not disliked it may be 
used with great advantage in our cookery: it is easily cultivated, aad quite 
deserves a nook in every kitchen-garden.

fish with Terj good effect ; and the forced eggs of page 137 may he 
placed at intervals round the edge of the bowl as a decoration, and 
an excellent accompaniment as well. Another mode of making the 
salad is to lay the split bodies of the fish round the bowl, and the 
daws, freed carefully from the shells, arranged high in the centre on 
the herbs ; the soft \yait of the bodies may be mixed with the sauce 
when it is liked ; but the colour will not then be good. 

Obs. — T he ad dition of cucumber in ribbons (see Author's Receipt, 
Chapter XVJLL\ laid lightly round it, is always an agreeable one to 
lobster salad : tney may previously be sauced, and then drained from 
their dressinff a little. 

A more wholesome and safer mode of imparting the flavour of the 
cucumber, however, is to use for the saUd vinegar in which that 
vegetable has been steeped for some hours after having been cut up 
BouL 

JlS excellent ' HERRINa SALAD. 
{Swedish Receipt,) 

Soak, skin, split, and bone a large Norway herring ; lay the two sides 
along a dish, and slice them slopingl;^ (or substitute for this one or 
two fine Dutch herrings). Arrange in symmetrical order over the 
fish slices of cooked beet-root, cold boiled potatoes, and pickled gher- 
kins ; then add one or two sharp apples chopped small, and the yolks 
and whites, separately minced, of some hard-boiled eggs, with any 
thing else which may be at hand, and may serve to vary tastefully 
the decoration of the dish. • Place these ingredients in small heaps of 
welL-oontrasting colours on the surface of tne salad, and lay a border 
of curled celery leaves or parsley round the bowl. 

For sauce, rub the yolk of one hard-boiled egg quite smooth with 
some salt ; to this add oil and vinegar as for an ordinary salad, and 
dilute the whole with some thick sour cream. 

Ohe, — '* Sour cream** ia an ingredient not much approved by Eng«* 
lish taste, but it enters largely into Grerman cookery, and into that of 
Sweden, and of other northern coimtries also. About half a pound 
of cold beef cut into small thin shavings or collops, is oflen added to 
a herring-salad abroad : it may be either of simply roasted or boiled, 
or of saUed and smoked meat. 

TARTAR SAUCE. 

{S€ttice a la Tartare). 

Add to the preceding remxndade^ or to any other sauce of the same 
nature, a teaspoonful or more of made mustard, one of finely-minced 
ahalots, one of parsley or tarragon, and one of capers or of pickled 
gherkins, with a rather hign seasoning of' cayenne, and some salt if 
needed. The tartar-mustard of the previous chapter, or good French 
mnstazdy Is to be preferred to English for this sauce, whidii is usually

made very pungent, and for inrbich anj ingredients can be used to the 
taste ivhich will serve to render it so. Tarragon vinegar, minced 
tarragon and esdialots, and plenty of oil, are used for it in France, in 
conjunction with the yolks of one or two ^gs, and chopped capers, 
or gherldns, to which olives are sometimes added. 

8IIRIMP CHATNET. 

'{Mauritian Receipt*) 

Shell with care a quart of fresh shrimps (for the mode of doing 
this see Chapter III.)* mince them quickly upon a dish with a large 
sharp knife, then turn them into a mortar and pound them to a per- 
fectly smooth paste. Next, mix with them very gradually two or 
three spoonsful of salad oil of the best quality, some young green 
chilies chopped small (or when these cannot be procured, some good 
cayenne pepper as a substitute), some young omons finely minced, a 
little saJt if required, and as much vinegar or strained lemon juice as 
will render the sauce pleasantly acid. Half a saltspoonful or more 
of powdered ginger is sometimes used in addition to the above ingre- 
dients. 

When they are preferred, two or three small shalots minced and well 
bruised with the shrimps may be substituted for the onions.* The 
proportion of oil shoula be double that of the vine^r used ; but in 
this preparation, as in all others of the same nature, individual taste 
must regulate the proportion of the most powerful condiments which 
enter into its composition. All chatneys snould be quite thick^ almost 
of the consistence of mashed turnips, or stewed tomatas, or stiff bread 
sauce. They are served with curries ; and also with steaks, cutlets, 
cold meat, and fish. In the East the native cooks crush to a pulp 
upon a stone slab, and with a stone roller, the ingredients which we 
direct to be pounded. On occasion the fish might oe merely minced. 
When beaten to a paste, they should be well separated with a fork as 
the chilies, &c., are added. 

CAPSICUMS CHATNEY. 

Slice transversely and very thin, into a bowl or pan of spring 
water, some large tender green capsicumbs, and let them steep ior an 
hour or two ; then drain, and dress with oil, vinegar, and salt.

some of which are excellent. 

CHETNEY SAUCE. 

(JBengcd Receipt), 

Stone four ounces of good raisins, and chop them 
, small, with half a pound of crabs, sour apples, unripe 
bullaces,* or of any other hard acid fruit. Take four 
ounces of coarse brown sugar, two of powdered ginger, 
and the same quantity of salt and cayenne pepper; 
grind these ingredients separately in a mortar, as mie as 
possible ; then pound the fruits well, and mix the spices 
with them, one by one ; beat them together imtil they 
are perfectly blended, and add gradually as much vine- 
gar as will make the sauce of the consistence of thick 
cream. Put it into bottles with an ounce of garlic^ 
divided into cloves, and cork it tightly. 

Stoned raisins, 4 oz. ; crabs, or other add fruit, \ lb.; 
coarse sugar, 4 oz. ; powdered ginger, 2 oz. ; salt, 2 oz. ; 
GarU cayenne pepper, 2 oz. ; garlic, 1 oz. ; vinegar, enough 

^ ^* to dilute it properly. 
Ohs, — This favourite oriental sauce is compounded in a great 
variety of ways ; but some kind of acid fruit is essential to it. The 
mango is used in India ; here gooseberries, while still hard and green, 
are sometimes used for it ; and ripe red chilies and tomatas are mixed 
with the other ingredients. The sauce keeps better if it be exposed 
to a gentle degree of heat for a week or two, either by the side of the 
fire, or in a full southern aspect in the sun : the heat of a very $hw 
oven, in which it might be left for a night, would propably nave a 
still better effect. In this case it must be put into a jar or bottles, 
and well secured from the air. Half a pound of gooseberries, or of 
these and tamarinds from the shell, and green apples mixed^ and the 
same weight of salt, stoned raisins, brown sugar, powdered ginger^ 
chilies, and garlic, with a pint and a half of vinegar, and the juice of 
three large lemons, will make another genuine Bengal chetney. 

FINE MUSHROOM CATSUP. 

One of the very best and most useful of store sauces is good 
home-made mushroom catsup, which, if really well prepared^ imparts 
an agreeable flavour to any soup or sauce with which it is mingled, 
and at the same time heightens the colour without imparting the

racter. Gooseberries or tomatas, after being subjected to a moderate degree of

"bitter sweetness** which the burnt sugar used as '* browning** in 
clumsy cookery so often does. The catsup ought, in fact, to be rather 
the pure essence of mushrooms, made with so much salt and spice only 
as are required to preserve it for a year or longer, than the com- 
pound of mushroom-juice, anchovies, shalots, allspice, and other con- 
dunents of which it is commonly composed, especially for sale. 

Directions to be observed in making and for keeping the catsup. — 
Let the mushrooms be collected when the weather is dry, for if 
rathered during, or immediately after rain, the catsup made wiUi 
mem will not keep well. 

Cut off the stalsL-ends to which the earth adheres, before the mush- 
rooms are broken np, and throw them aside, as they shotdd never be 
nsed for the catsup. Reject also such of the flaps as are worm-eaten 
or decayed. Those which are too stale for use may be detected by the 
smell, which is very offensive. 

When the mushroom first opens, the under-side is of a fine pale 
saknon colour; this changes soon to a sort of ashy-brown, which 
deepens almost to black as the mushroom passes &om its maturity to 
a state of decay. As it yields a greater abundance of juice when it is 
fidly ripe, it is usually taken in that state for these sauces ; but cat- 
sup of hnc and delicate flavour, though somewhat pale in colour, can 
be made even of mushroom-buttons if they be snced up small and 
tamed often in the liquid which will be speedily drawn from them 
Inr the application of^ salt ; a rather smaller proportion of which 
anonld be mingled with them than is directed for the following 
leoeipt. 

Every thing nsed in preparing the catsup should be delicately 
dean and very dry. The bottles in which it is stored, after being dried 
in the usual way, shotdd be laid into a cool oven for an hour or two 
before they are filled, to ensure their being free from the slightest 
di^ree of moisture, but they must be quite cold before the catsup is 
poured into them. If the corks be sealed so as to exclude the air 
effectually, or if well-cleansed bits of bladder first dried, and then 
Tendered flexible with a little spirit of any kind (spirits of wine is 
convenient for such purposes), be tied closely over them, and the 
bottles can be kept in a cool place free from damp, the catsup will 
xemam good for a long time. 



HUSH ROOM CATSUP. 

Receipt: — Break up small into a deep earthen pan, two gallons of 
large ripe mushroom-flaps, and strew amongst them three quarters, of 
a ponnd of salt, reserving the larser portion of it for the top. Let 
them remain two days, and stir them gently with a wooden spoon 
often during the time; then turn them into a large ste^vTAn or 
enamelled saucepan, heat them slowly, and simmer them for fineen or 
twenty minutes. Strain the liquor closely from them without pres*

sure ; strain and measure it ; pnt it into a verv clean stcwpan, and 
boil it quickly until it is reduced nearly half. For every quart allow 
half an ounce of black peppercorns and a drachm of mace ; or, instead 
of the pepper, a quarter of a teaspoonful (ten trains) of good cayenne ; 
pour the catsup into a clean jug or jar, lay a folded cloth over it, and 
keep it in a cool place imtil the following day ; pour it gently from 
the sediment, put into small bottles, cork them well, and rosin them 
down. A teaspoonful of salad oil may be poured into each bottle before 
it is corked, the better to exclude the air from the catsup. 

Mushrooms, 2 gallons : salt, f lb. ; to macerate three or four days. 
To each quart of liquor, j oz. black pepper, or quarter of a teaspoonful 
of cayenne ; and 1 drachm of mace : to >)e reduced nearly half. 

Obs, 1. — Catsup made thus will sot be too salt, nor will the flavour 
of the mushrooms be overpowered by that of the spices ; of which a 
lai^r quantity, and a greater variety, can be used at vrUl. 

We can, however, answer for the excellence of the present receipt 
from long experience of it. When the catsup is boiled down quite 
early in the day, it may be bottled the same night : it is necessary 
only, that it should ha perfectly cold before this is done. 

Obs, 2. — When the mushrooms are crushed, or mashed, as some 
authors direct, the liquor will necessarilv be very thick ; it is better 
to proceed as above, and then to boil the liquor which may after- 
wards be extracted from the mushrooms by pressure, with the sedi- 
ment of the catsup, and sufficient cloves, pepper, allspice, and ginser, 
to flavour it highly : this second catsup will be found very usefiu to 
mix with common thickened sauces, hashes, and stews. 

MUSHROOM CATSUP. 

(Another Receipt) 

Break a peck of large mushrooms into a deep earthenpan ; strew 
three quarters of a pound of salt amongst them, and set tnem into a 
very cool oven for one night, with a fold of cloth or paper over them. 
The following day strain off the liquor, measure, and boil it for fifteen 
minutes ; then, for each quart, add an ounce of black pepper, a 
quarter of an ounce of allspice, half an ounce of ginger, and two large 
blades of mace, and let it boil fast for twenty minutes longer. When 
thoroughly cold, put it into bottles, cork them well, and dip the necks 
into melted bottle-cement, or seal them so as to secure the catsup from 
the air. 

Mushrooms, 1 peck ; salt, f lb. Liquor to boil, 15 minutes. To 
each quart, \ oz. black pepper ; i oz. allspice ; } oz. ginger ; 2 blades

On a gallon of fresh mushrooms strew three ounces of salt, and ponr 
to them a quart of ready-made catsup (that which is a year old will

do if it be perfectly ffood) ; keep these stirred occasionally for four 
days, then drain the liquor very dry from the mushrooms, and boil it 
for fifteen minutes with an ounce of whole black pepper, a drachm of 
mace, an ounce of ginger, and three or four grains only of cayenne. 

Mushiooms, 1 gaUon; salt, 3 oz. ; mushroom catsup, I quart: 
peppercorns, 1 oz. ; mace, 1 drachm ; ginger, 1 oz. ; cayenne, 3 to 4

COMPOUND^ OR cook's CATSUP. 

Take a pint and a half of mushroom catsup when it is first made^ 
and ready boiled (the double is best for the purpose), simmer in it for 
fire minutes an ounce of small eschalots mcely peeled ; add to these 
half a pint of walnut catsup, and a wineglassful of cayenne vinesar, 
or of chili vine^r ; give the whole one boil, pour it out, and when 
cold, bottle it with the eschalots in it. 

Mushroom catsup, H pint ; eschalots, 1 oz. ; walnut catsup or 
pickle, 1 pint ; cayenne or chili yinegar, 1 wineglassful. 

WALNUT CATSUP. 

The vinegar in which walnuts have been pickled, when they have 
lenuiined in it a year, will generally answer all the purposes for 
which this catsup is required, particularly if it be drained from them 
and boiled for a' few minutes, with a little additional snice, and a few 
eschalots ; but where the vinegar is objected to, it may be made either 
by boiling the expressed juice of young walnuts for an hour, with six 
ounces of fine anchovies, four ounces of eschalots, half an ounce of 
black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of doves, and a drachm of mace, 
to every quart ; or as follows : — 

Pound in a mortar a hundred young walnuts, strewing amongst 
them as they are done half a pound of salt ; then pour to them a 
qnait of strong vinegar, and let them stand until they have become 
quite black, keeping them stirred three or four times a dav ; next add 
a quart of strong old beer, and boil the whole together for ten 
minutes; strain it, and let it remain until the next day ; then pour it 
off clear from the sediment, add to it half a pound of anchovies, one 
lai^ head of garlic bruised, half an ounce of nutmegs bruised, the 
same quantity of cloves and black pepper, and two drachms of mace : 
boil these together for half an hour, and the following day bottle and 
cork the catsup well. It will keep for a dozen years. Many persons 
add to it, before it is boiled, a bottle of port wine ; and others recom- 
mend a large bunch of sweet herbs to be put in with the spice.

ANOTHER GOOD RECEIPT FOR WALNUT CATSUP. 

Beat a hundred green walnuts in a large marble mortar until they 
are thoroughly bruised and broken, and then put them into a stone 
lar, with half a pound of eschalots, cut in slices, one head of garlic, 
lalf a pound of salt, and two quarts of vinegar ; let them stand for 
ten da;^s, and stir them night and morning. Strain off the liquor, 
and boil it for half an hour with the addition of two ounces of an- 
chovies, two of whole pepper, half an oimce of cloves, and two 
drachms of mace ; skim it well, strain it off, and when it is quite cold 
pour it gently from the sediment (which may be reserved for flavour- 
ing common sauces) into small dry bottles, secure it &om air by sound 
corking, and store it in a dry place. 

Walnuts, 100 ; eschalots, ) lb. ; garlic, 1 head , salt, i lb. ; vin^;ar 
2 quarts : 10 days. Anchovies, 2 oz. ; black pepper, 2 oz. ; mace, 
\ oz. : cloves, } oz. : J hour. 

LEMON PICKLE OR CATSUP. 

Either divide six small lemons into quarters, remove all the pips 
that are in si^ht, and strew three ounces of salt upon them, and keep 
them turned m it for a week, or, merely make deep incisions in them, 
and proceed as directed for pickled lemons. When they have stood 
in a warm place for eight days, put into a stone jar two ounces and 
a half of flnely-scraped horseramsh, and two ounces of eschalots, or 
one and a half of garlic; to these add the lemons with all their liquor, 
and pour on them a pint and a half of boiling vinegar in which half 
an ounce of bruised ginger, a quarter of an ounce of whole white 
pepper, and two blades of mace have been simmered for two or three 
minutes. The pickle will be fit for use in two or three months, but 
may stand four or five before it is strained off. 

Small lemons, 6; salt, 3 oz. : 8 days. Horseradish, 21- oz.; escha- 
lots, 2 oz., or garlic 1^ oz. ; vinegar, 1^ pint ; ginger, i oz. ; whole 
white pepper, i oz. ; mace, 2 blades : 3 to 6 months. 

Obs.— These highlv-flavoured compounds are still much in favour 
with a certain class of housekeepers ; but they belong exclusively to 
English cookery : they are altogether opposed to the practice of the 
l^'rench cuisine^ as well as to that of other foreign countries. 

PONTAO CATSUP FOR FISH. 

On one pint of ripe elderberries stripped from the stalks, pour 
three quarters of a pint of boiling vinegar, and let it stand in a cool 
oven all night ; the next day strain off the liquid without pressure. 



CHAP. TIL J STOBE SAUCES. 151 

and boil it for five minutes xntb a half-teaspoonful of salt, a small 
lace of ginger, a blade of mace, forty corns of pepper, twelve cloves 
and four eschalots. Bottle it with the spice when it is quite cold. 

BOTTLED TOMATAS, OR TOMATA CATSUP. 

Cut half a peck of ripe tomatas into quarters ; lay them on dishes 
and sprinkle over them half a pound of salt. The next day drain the 
Juice from them through a hair-sieve into a stew-pan, and boil it for 
naif an hour with three dozens of small capsicums and half a pound 
of eschalots ; then add the tomatas, which should be ready pulped 
through a strainer. Boil the whole for thirty minutes longer; have 
some clean wide-necked bottles, kept warm by the fire, fill them 
with the catsup while it is quite hot ; cork, and dip the necks into 
melted bottle-resin or cement. 

Tomatas, i peck ; salt, i lb. ; capsicums, 3 doz. ; eschalots, i| lb. 
^ hour. After pulp is added, i hour. 

Obs. — This receipt has been kindly contributed by a person who 
makes by it every year large quantities of the catsup, which is consi- 
dered excellent : for sauce it must be mixed with gravy or melted 
Imtter. We have not ourselves been able to make tnal of it. 

EPICUREAN SAUCE. . 

Mix well, by shaking them in a bottle, a wineglassflil of Ihdiaa 
soy, half a pint of chili vinegar, half a pint of walnut catsup, and a 
pint and a naif of the best mushroom catsup. These proportions 
make an excellent sauce, either to mix with melted butter, and to 
serve with fish, or to add to difierent kinds of gravy ; but they can 
be varied, or added to, at pleasure. 

Indian soy, 1 wineglassful ; chili vinegar, i pint ; walnut catsup, 
i pint : mushix>om catsup, 1^ pint. 

TARRAGON VINEGAR. 

Gather the tarragon just before it blossoms, which will be late in 
July, or early in August; strip it from the larger stalks, and put it 
into small stone jars or wide-necked bottles, and in doine this twist 
some of the branches so as to bruise the leaves and wring tnem asun- 
^r; then pour in sufficient distilled or very pale vinegar to cover the 
tarragon; let it infuse for two months, or more : it will take no harm 
even by standing all the winter. When it is poured of^ strain it ver^ 
dear, put it into small dry bottles, and cork them well. Sweet basil 
vinesar is made in exactly the same way, but it should not be left on 
the leaves more than three weeks. The jars or bottles shotdd be 
filled to the neck with the tarragon before the vinegar is added : its 
flavour is strong and peculiar, but to many tastes very agreeable. It 
imparts quite a foreign character to the dishes for which it is used.

GREEN MIKT VINHGAR. 

Slightly chop, or bruise, freshly-gathered mint, and put it into* 
bottles ; till them nearly to the necks, and add vinegar as for tarra- 
gon : in forty days, strain it off, and bottle it for use. 

The mint itself, ready mincad for sauce, will keep well in vinegar, 
though the colour will not be very fi;ood. The ^oung leaves stripped 
from the stems, should be used for this preparation. 

CUCUMBER VINEGAR. 

First wipe, and then, without paring, slice into a stone far some 
young and quickly-grown cucumbers ; pour on them as much boiling 
vinegar as will cover them well, with a teaspoonful of salt, and two- 
thircb as much of pepnercoms to the pint and a half of vinegar : it 
may remain on them for a month, or even for two, if well defended 
from the air : it should then be strained, allowed to settle, and poured 
quite clear into small dry bottles, which should be well corked. A 
mild onion can be intermixed with the cucumbers, when its flavour is 
considered an improvement 

CELERY VINEGAR. 

Throw into a pint and a half of ready boiling vinegar a few grains 
of cayenne, or half an ounce of peppercorns, a large saltspoonful of 
salt, and a pint of the white part of the roots and steins of some fine 
fre^ celery sliced up thin : let it boil for two or three minutes, turn 
it into a stone jar, and secure it well from the air as soon as it is cold 
It may be strained off and bottled in three or four weeks, but may 
remain as many months in the jar without injury. 

ESCHALOT^ OR GARLIC VINEGAR. 

On from four to six ounces of eschalots or on two of ^;arlic peeled 
and bruised, pour a quart of the best vineccar ; stop the jar or bottle 
dose, and in a fortnight or thi'ee weeks tte vinegar may be strained 
off for use : a few drops will give a sufficient flavour to a sauce, or to 
a tureen of gravy. 

Eschalots, 4 to 6 oz.; or, garlic, 2 to 4 oz.; vinegar, 1 quart: 15 
to 21 days 

Obs. — These roots may be used in smaller or in larger proportion, 
as a slighter or a stronger flavour of them is desired, and may remain 
longer m the vinegar without any detriment to it 

ESCHALOT WINE. 

This is a far more useful preparation even than the preceding one, 
cinoe it can be used to impart the flavour of the eschalot to dishes fox

"which add ia not required. Peel and slices or bmiBe, four ounces of 
eschalots, put them into a bottle, and add to them a pint of sherry ; 
in a fortnight pour off the wine, and should it not be strongly fla- 
voured with the eschalots, steep in it two ounces more, for another 
fortnight ; a half-teaspooniul of cayenne may be added at first. The 
bottle should be shaken occasionally, while the eschalots are infusing, 
hut should remain undisturbed for the last two or tbree days, that 
the wine may be dear when it is poured off to bottle for keeping. 
Sweet-basil wine is made by steeping the fresh leaves of the herb in 
wine, from ten to fifteen days. 

Eschalots, 4 oz.; sherr}', I pint: 15 days, or more. 

BORSRUADISH TINEOAR. 

On four ounces of young and freshly-scraped horseradish pour a 
ouart of boiling vinegar, and cover it down closely : it will be ready 
for use in three or four days, but may remain for weeks, or months, 
before the vin^ar is poured off. An ounce of minced eschalot may 
be sabstituted &r one of the horseradish, if the flavour be liked. 

CAYENNE VINEGAR. 

Put from a quarter to half an ounce of the best cayenne nepper 
into a bottle, and pour on it a pint of pale vinegar. Cork it closelyi 
and shake it well every two or three days. It may remain any length 
of time before it is poured off, but will very soon be ready for use. 

Good cayenne pepper, ^ to i oz.; vinegar, 1 pint: infuse from 
2 weeks to 12 months. 

LEMON DRAKBV. 

(For flavovrxng tweet dishes,') 

Fill any sized wide-necked bottle lightly with the very thin rinds 
of fresh lemons, and cover them with gooa brandy ; let them remain 
for a fortnight or three weeks only, then strain off the spirit and keep 
H well corked for use : a few apricot-kernels blanched and infused 
with the lemon-rind will give it an agreeable flavour. 

DRIED MUSHROOMS. 

Peel small, sound, freshly-gathered flaps, cut off the stems, and 
scrape out the fur entirely ; then arrange the mushrooms singly en 
tins or dishes, and dry them as gradually as possible in a gentle oven. 
Put them, when they are done, into tin canisters, and store them 
where they will be secure from damp. French cooks give them a 
single boil in water, from which they then are well drained, and dried, 
as usnaL When wanted for table, they should be put into cold gravy, 
■lowly heated, and gently simmered, until they are tender. 



154 MODEEN COOKERY. [chap. tii. 

MUSHROOM POWDER. 

"When the mushrooms have been prepared with great nicety, and 
dried, as in the foregoing receipt, pound them to a very fine powder; 
sift it, and put it immediately into small and perfectty dry bottles ; 
cork and seid them without delay, for if the powder be Ions exposed 
to the air, so as to imbibe an^ humidity, or if it be not weU secured 
from it in the bottles, it will be likely to become putrid : much of 
that which is purchased, even at the best Italian warehouses, is found 
to be so, and, as it is sold at a very high price, it is a great economy, 
as well as a surer plan, to have it carefully prepared at home. It is 
an exceedingly useful store, and an excellent addition to many dishes 
tind sauces. To insure its being good, the mushrooms should be 
gathered in dry weather, and if any addition of spices be made to the 
X)owder (some persons mix with it a seasoning of mace and ca3renne), 
they should be put into the oven for a whife before they are uaed : 
but even these precautions will not be sufiicient, unless the powder be 
stored in a very dry place after it is bottled. A teaspoonful of it, 
with a quarter of a pint of strong veal gravy, as much cream, and a 
small dessertspoonful of flour, will make a good hichamel or white 
«auce. 

EXCELLENT POTATO FLOUR, OR ARROWROOT. 

{Fectde de Pommes de terre.) 

Grate into a large vessel full of cold water, six pounds of sound 
mealy potatoes, ana stir them well together. In six hours pour oflf 
the water, and add fresh, stirring the mixture well ; repeat this pro- 
cess every three or four hours during the day, change the water at 
night, and the next morning pour it off; put two or three quarts 
more to the potatoes, and turn them directly into a hair-sieve, set 
over a pan to receive the flour, which may then be washed through 
the sieve, by pouring water to it. Let it settle in the pan, drain off 
the water, spread the potato-sediment on dishes, dry it in a slow oven, 
flift it, and put it into bottles or jars, and cork or cover them closely. 
The flour thus made will be beautifully white, and perfectly flavour- 
less. It will remain good for years. 

Ohs, — ^This admirable farina, or starch of potatoes, is now much 
more widely known and vended in England than it was some years 
fiince. It can at present be procured at most forei^ warehouses and 
general grocers* ; but we would recommend its being home-made by 
the directions given above, which we have had closely followed for 
many years wiui the best possible success. 

TO MAKE FLOUR OF RICE. 

Take any quantity of whole rice, wash it thoroughly, changing the 
water several times ; drain and sress it in a cloth, then spread it on a 



CHAP, vn.] 6T0RE SAUCES. 155 

^dkb, and dry it perfectly ; beat it in a mortar to a smooth powder, 
and sift it through a fine sieve. When used to thicken soup or 
sauces, mix it with a small quantity of cold water or of broth, and 
pour it to them while they are boiling. 

This flour, when newly made, ia of much purer flavour than any 
iisuaUy prepared for sale. 

POWDER OF SAYOITRT HERDS. 

All herbs which are to be dried for storing should be gathered in 
fine weather; cleared from dirt and decayed leaves; and dried quickly, 
but without scorching, in a Dutch oven before the fire, or in any 
other that is not too much heated. The leaves shotdd then be 
stripped from the stalks, pounded, sifted, and closely corked in sepa- 
rate bottles ; or several kinds may be mixed and pounded together for 
the convenience of seasoning in an instant gravies, soups, forcemeats, 
and made dishes : appropriate spices, celery-seed, and dried lemon- 
peel, all in fine powder, can be added to the herbs. 

TARTAR MUSTARD. 

Kub four ounces of the best Durham mustard very smooth with a 
full teaspoonful of salt, and wet it by degrees with strong horseradish 
vinegar, a dessertspoonful of cayenne, or of chili vinegar, and one or 
two of tarragon vinegar when its flavour is not disliked. A quarter 
of a pint of vinegar poured boiling upon an ounce of scraped liorse- 
radisb, and left for one night, closely covered, will be ready to use 
for this mustard, but it will be better for standmg two or three days. 

Durham mustard, 4 oz. ; salt, large teaspoonful ; cayenne, or chili 
vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful ; horseradish vinegar, third of pint. 

Obs, — This is an exceedingly pungent compound, but has many 
approvers. 

ANOTHER TARTAR MUSTARD. 

Mix the salt and mustard smoothly, with equal parts of horseradish 
vinegar, and of chili vinegar. Mustard made by these receipts will 
keep long, if put into jars or bottles and closely corked. Cucumber, 
^scnalot, or any other of the flavoured vin^;ar8 for which we have 
given receipts, may in turn be used for it, and mushroom, gherkin, or 
India pickle-liquor, likewise.

GSNERAX REMARKS. 

The coarse and unpalatable com- 
pounds 80 constantly met with 
under the denomination of force- 
meat, even at tables otherwise 
tolerably well served, show with 
how little attention they are com- 
monly prepared. 

Many very indifferent cooks 
pique themselves on never doing 
any thing by rule, and the conse- 

^ „ It random (or "by guess" as they 

call it) the ingredients \vnich ought to be proportioned with exceeding 
exactness is repeated failure in all they attempt to do. Long expe- 
rience, and a very correct eye may, it is true, enable a person to 
dispense with weights and measures without hazarding the success of 
their operations; but it is an experiment which the learner will do 
better to avoid. 

A large marble or Wedgwood mortar is indispensable in making all 
the finer kinds of forcemeat ; and equally so indeed for many other 
purposes in cookery ; no kitchen, therefore, should be without one ;* 
and for whatever preparation it may be used, the pounding should be 
continued with patience and perseverance until not a single lump or 
fibre be perceptible in the mass of the articles beaten together. This 
particularly applies to potted meats, which should resemble the 
smoothest paste; as well as to several varieties of forcemeat. Of 
these last it should be observed, that such as are made by the French 
method (see quenelles) are the most appropriate for an elegant dinner, 

* Two or three mortars, yarying in size, should be in every hooscholtl where it 
is expected that the cookery should be well oonduuted : they are often required 
also for many other domestic puqioses, yet it is not unusual to find both these 
and acales, weights, and measures of every kind, altogetlier wanting in EngUsIr 
kitchens.

either to serve in soups or to fill boned poultry of an^ kind ; but 
vhen their exceeding lightness, which to foreigners constitutes one of 
their great excellences, is objected to, it may be remedied by substi- 
tuting dry crumbs of bread for the panada, and pounding a small 
quantity of the lean of a boiled ham, with the other ingredients: how- 
ever, this should be done only for the balls. 

No particular herb or spice should be allowed to predominate 
powerfully in these compositions ; but the whole of the seasoning 
should be taken in such quantity only as will produce an agreeable 
savour when they are blended together. 

KG. 1. GOOD COMMON FORCEMEAT^ FOR ROAST TEAL, 
TURKEYS, &C. 

Grate very lightly into exceedingly fine crumbs, four ounces of the 
inside of a stale loaf, and mix thoroughly with it, a quarter of an 
ounce of lemon-rind pared as thin as possible, and minced extremely 
small; the same quantity of savoury herbs, of which two-thirds 
should be parsley, and one-third thyme, likewise finely minced, a little 
grated nutmeg, a half teaspoonful of salt, and as much common 
pepper or cayenne as will season the forcemeat sufiiciently. Break 
into these, two ounces of good butter in very small bits, add the 
unbeaten yolk of one egg, and with the fingers work the whole well 
together until it b* smoothly mixed. It is usual to chop the lemon- 
rind, but we prefer it lightly grated on a fine grater. It should 
always be fresh for the purpose, or it will be likely to impart a very 
unpleasant flavour to the forcemeat. Half the rind of a moderate- 
sized lemon will be sufficient for this quantity; which for a large 
turkey must be increased one-half. 

Bread-crumbs, 4 oz. ; lemon-rind, J oz. (or grated rind of } lemon) ; 
mixed savoury herbs, minced, i oz. ; salt, ^ teaspoonful ; pepper, ^ to 
i of teaspoonful ; butter, 2 oz. ; yolk, 1 egg. 

Obs. — This, to our taste, is a much nicer and more delicate force- 
meat than that which is made with suet, and wc would recommend it 
for trial in preference. Any variety of herb or spice may be used to 
give it flavour, and a little minced onion or eschadot can be added to 
it also; but these last do not appear to us suited to the meats for 
which the forcemeat is more particularly intended. Half an ounce of 
the butter may be omitted on ordinary occasions : and a portion of 
marjoram or of sweet basil may take tlie place of part of the thyme 
and parsley when preferred to them. 

wo. 2. ANOTHER GOOD COMMON FORCEMEAT. 

Add to four ounces of bread-crambs two of the lean of a boiled 
ham, quite free from sinew, and very finely minced; two of good 
butter, a dessertspoonful of herbs, chopped small, some lemon-grate, 
nutmeg, a little salt, a good seasoning of^ pepper or cayenne and one

whole ^gg, or the yolks of two. This may be IHed in balls of mode- 
rate size, for fire minutes, to serve with roast yeal, or it may be put 
into the joint in the usual way. 

Bread-crumbs, 4 oz.; lean of ham, 2 oz. ; butter, 2 oz.; minced 
herbs, 1 dessertspoonful ; lemon-grate, 1 teaspoonful ; nutmeg, mace, 
and cayenne, together, 1 small teaspoonful; little salt; 1 whole egg, 
or yolks of 2. 

^*0• 3. SUPERIOR SUET FORCEMEAT, FOR VEAL, TURKEYS, &C. 

Mix well together six ounces of fine stale crumbs, with an eqna^ 
weight of beef-Kidney suet, chopped extremely small, a large dessert- 
spoonful of parsley, mixed with a little lemon- thyme, a teaspoonful 
of salt, a quarter one of cayenne, and a saltspoonful or rather more 
of mace and nutmeg together ; work these up with three unbeaten 
egg-yolks, and three teaspoonsful of milk ; then put the forcemeat 
into a large mortar, and pound it perfectly smooth. Take it out, and 
let it remain in a cool place for half an hour at least before it is used ; 
then roll it into balls, if it be wanted to serve in that form ; flour and 
fry them gently from seven to eight minutes, and dry them well 
before they are dished. 

Beef suet finely minced, 6 oz. ; bread-crumbs, 6 oz.; parsley, 
mixed with little thyme, 1 large dessertspoonful ; salt, 1 teaspoonful; 
mace, large saltspoonful, and one fourth as much cayenne ; unbeaten 
egg-yolks, 3 ; milk, 3 teaspoonsful : well pounded. Fried in balls, 7 
to 8 minutes, or poached, 6 to 7. 

Obs. — The finely grated rind of half a lemon can be added to this 
forcemeat at pleasure ; and for some purposes a morsel of garlic, or 
three or four minced eschalots, may be mixed with it before it is put 
into the mortar. 

KG. 4. COMMON SUET FORCEMEAT. 

Beef suet is commonly used in the composition of this kind of 
forcemeat, but we think that veal-kidney suet, when it could be 
obtained, would have a better effect ; though the reader will easily 
comprehend that it is scarcely possible for us to have every variety of 
every receipt which we insert put to the test ; in some cases we are 
compelled merely to suggest what appear to us likely to be improve- 
ments. Strip carefully every morsel of skin from the suet, and 
mince it small; to six ounces add eight of bread-crumbs, with the 
same proportion of herbs, spice, salt, and lemon-peel, as in the fore- 
going receipt, and a couple of whole eggs, which should be Teiy 
Slightly beaten, after the specks have been taken out with the point 
of a small fork. Should more liquid be required, the yolk of another 
eg^, or a spoonful or two of milk, may be used. Half this quantity 
will be sufficient for a small joint of veal, or for a dozen balls, which, 
when it is more convenient to serve it in that form, may be fried or 



CHAP, vm.] FOBCEMEATS. 159 

browued beneath the roast, and then dished round it, though this last 
k not a yery refined mode of dressing them. From eight to ten 
minutes will fry them weU. 

NO. 5. OTSTEB FORCEMEAT. 

Open carefully a dozen of fine plump natives, take off the beardsy 
strain their liquor, and rinse the oysters in it. Grate four ounces of 
the emmb of a stale loaf into fine light crumbs, mince the oysters but 
not too small, and mix them with the bread ; add an ounce and a half 
of good butter broken into minute bits, the grated rind of half a small 
lemon, a small saltspoonful of pounded mace, some cayenne, a little 
salt, and a large teaspoonful of parsley. Mingle these ingredients 
well, and work them together with the unbeaten yolk of one egg and 
a little of the oyster liquor, the remainder of which can be added to 
the sauce which usually accompanies this forcemeat. 

Oysters, 1 dozen; bread-crumbs, 4 oz.; butter, 1^^ oz. ; rind i^ small 
lemon ; mace, 1 saltspoonful ; some cayenne and salt ; minced parsle}^ 
1 large teaspoonful; yolk 1 egg; oyster-liquor, 1 dessertspoonful - 
rolled into balls, and £ried from 7 to 10 minutes, or poachea from 5 
to 6 minutes. 

Oh». — In this preparation the flavour of the oysters should prevail 
entirely over that or all the other ingredients which are mixed with 
them. 

Ohs, 2. — ^The oyster-sausages of Chapter III. will serve excellently 
for forcemeat also. 

NO, 6. A FINER OYSTER FORCEMEAT. 

Pound the preceding forcemeat to the smoothest paste, with the 
addition only of half an ounce of fresh butter, should it be sufficiently 
dry to allow of it. It is remarkably good when thus prepared, and 
may be poached or fried in balls for soups or made dishes, or used to 
fill boned fowls, or the breasts of boiled turkeys with equally good 
effect 

NO. 7. MUSHROOM FORCEMEAT. 

Cut closely off the stems of some small, just-opened mushrooms, 
peel them, and take out the fur. Dissolve an ounce and a half of 
good butter in a saucepan, throw them into it with a little cayenne 
and a alight sprinkling of mace, and stew them softly, keeping them 
well shaken, from five to seven minutes ; then turn them into a dish^ 
spread them over it, and raise one end, that the liquid may draia 
from them. When they are quite cold, mince, and then mix them 
witn four ounces of fine bread-crumbs, an ounce and a half of good 
Gutter, and part of that in which they were stewed should the force- 
Qieat appear too moist to admit of the whole, as the yolk of one egg^ 



160 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP.TIIL 

at the least, must be added, to bind the in^^redients together ; strew 
in a saltspoonful of salt, a third as much of cayenne, and about the 
same quantity of mace and nutmeg, with a teaspoonful of grated 
lemon-rind. The seasonings must be rather sparingly used, tlat the 
flavour of the mushrooms may not be overpower^ by them. Mix 
the whole thoroughly with the unbeaten yolk of one egg, or of two, 
and use the forcemeat poached in small balls for soup, or fried and 
served in the dish with roast fowls, or round minced veal ; or to fill 
boiled fowls, partridges, or turkeys. 

Small mushrooms, peeled and trimmed, 4 oz. ; butter H oz. ; slight 
sprinkling mace and cayenne : 5 to 7 minutes. Mushrooms minced ; 
bread-crumbs, 4 oz. ; butter, l^ oz. (with part of that used in the 
stewing) ; salt, 1 saltspoonful ; third as much of cayenne, of mace, 
and of nutmeg ; grated lemon-rind, 1 teaspoonful ; yolk of 1 or 2 
eggs. In balls, poached, 5 to 6 minutes ; fried, 6 to 8 minutes. 

Obs. — This, like most other forcemeats, is improved by being well 
beaten in a large mortar after it is entirely mixed. 

NO. 8. FORCEMEAT FOR HARE. 

The first receipt of this chapter will be found very good for hare 
without any variation ; but the liver boiled for three minutes and 
finely minced, may be added to it when it is thought an improvement: 
anotner half ounce of butter, and a small portion more of egg will 
then be required. A couple of ounces of rasped bacon, and a glass of 
port-wine, are sometimes recommended for this forcemeat, but we 
think it is better without them, especially when slices of bacon are 
used to line the hare. A flavouring of minced onion or eschalot can 
be added when the taste is in its favour ; or the forcemeat No. 3 may 
be substituted for this altogether 

NO. 9. ONION AND SAGE STUFFING, FOit PORK, GEESE, 
OR DUCKS. 

Boil three large onions from ten to fifteen minutes, press the water 
from them, chop them small, and mix with them an equal quantity of 
bread-crumbs, a heaped tablespoonful of minced sage, an ounce of 
butter, a half saltspoonful of pepper, and twice as much of salt, and 
put them into the body of the goose ; part of the liver boiled for two 
or three minutes and shred fine, is sometimes added to these, and the 
whole is bound together with the yolk of one egg or two ; but they 
are quite as frequently served without. 'Ihc onions can be used raw, 
when their very strong flavour is not objected to, but the odour of 
the whole dish will then be somewhat overpowering. 

Large onions, 3 ; boiled 20 to 30 minutes. Sage, *2 to 3 dessert- 
spoonsful ( or ^ to 2 oz.) ; butter, 1 oz. : pepper, i teaspoonful; sait« 
1 teaspoonful 



CHAP.Yin.] FORCEMEATS. 161 

The body ol a goose k K>metimes entirely filled with mashed pota- 
toes, seasoned with salt and pepper onl;f ; or mixed with a small 
quantity of eschalot, onion, or herb-seasonings. 

KO« 10. MR. ODOKk's forcemeat FOR DUCKS OR GEESE. 

Two parts of chopped onion, two parts of bread-crumbs, three of 
batter, one of pounded sage, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. 
This receipt we have not proved. 

NO. 11. FORCEMEAT 3ALI^ FOR MOCK TURTLE SOCPS. 

The French forcemeat. No. 17 of the present Chapter, is the most 
refined and appropriate forcemeat to serve in mock turtle, but a more 
solid and highly seasoned one is usually added to it in this country. 
In very common cookery the ingredients are merely chopped smiul 
and mixed together with a moistening of ^;gs ; but when the trouble 
of pounding and blending them properlv is objected to, we would 
recommend the common veal forcemeat No. 1, in preference ; as the 
undressed veal and suet, when merely minced, do not produce a good 
effect. Four ounces each of these, with an ounce or so of the lean of 
a boiled ham, and three ounces of bread-crumbs, a large dessert- 
spoonful of minced parsley, a small portion of thyme or marjoram, a 
saltspoonful of white pepper, twice as much or more of salt, a little 
cayenne, half a small nutmeg, and a couple of eggs, well mixed with 
a fork first to separate the meat, and auer the moistening is added, 
with the fingers, then rolled into ball§, and boiled in a little soup for 
twelve minutes, is the jmanner in which it is prepared ; but the reader 
will find the following receipt very superior to it :--Rasp, that is to 
say, scrape with a knife clear from tne fibre, four ounces of veal, 
which should be cut into thick slices, and taken quite free from skin 
and fat ; chop it fine, and then pound it as smoothly as possible in a 
IsLTge mortar, with three ounces of the rasped fat of an unboiled ham 
of good flavour or of the finest bacon, and one of butter, two ounces 
of bread-crumbs, a tablespoonful of the lean of a boiled ham, should 
it be at hand, a goed seasoning of cayenne, nutmeg, and mace, mixed 
together, a heaped dessertspoonful of minced herbs, and the yolks of 
two ^ggs ; jx>acn a small bit when it is mixed, and add any further 
seasoning it may require ; and when it is of good flavour, roll it into 
halls of moderate size, and boil them twelve minutes ; then drain and 
drop them into the soup. No forcemeat should be boiled in the soup 
itself, on account of the fat which would escape from it in tiie process : 
a little stock should be reserved for the purpose. 

Very common :— Lean of neck of veal, 4 oz. ; beef-kidney suet, 4 
oz., both finely chopped ; bread-crumbs, 3 oz. ; minced parsley, large 
dessertspoonful ; thvme or marjoram, small teaspoouful; lean of boiled 
ham, I to 2 oz. ; white pei>per, 1 saltspoonful ; sfdt, twice as much ; 
i imail nutmeg ; eggs, 2 : in balls, 12 minutps.

162 MODERN COOEEBT. [chap. Yin. 

Better forcemeat : — Lean veal rasped, 4 oz. ; fat of nnboiled ham, 
or finest bacon, 3 oz. ; butter, 1 oz. ; bread-crumbs, 2 oz. ; lean of 
boiled ham, minced, 1 large tablespoonful ; minced herbs, 1 heaped 
dessertspoonful ; full seasoning of mace, nutm^, and cayenne, mixed ; 
yolks 01 eggs, 2 : 12 minutes. 

NO. 12. EGG BALLS. 

Boil four or fire new-laid eggs for ten or twelve minutes, and lay 
them into fresh water until they are cold. Take out the yolks, and 
pound them smoothly with the beaten yolk of one raw egg, or more, 
if required ; add a little salt and cayenne, roll the mixture into ball? 
the size of marbles, and boil them for two minutes. Half a teaspoon- 
fill of flour is sometimes worked up with the esgs. 

Hard yolks of eggs, 4 ; 1 raw ; fittle salt andcayenne : 2 minutes. 

NO. 13. BRAIN CAKES. 

Wash and soak the brains well in cold water, and aflerwaids in hot ; 
free them from the skin and large fibres, and boil them in water, 
slightlv salted, from two to three minutes; beat them up with a tea- 
spoonful of sage very finely chopped, or with equal parts of sage and 
parsley, half a teaspoonful or rather more of salt, half as much mace, 
a little white pepper or cayenne, and one egg ; drop them in small 
cakes into the pan, and fry them in butter a fine light brown : t^wo 
yolks of eggs will make the cakes more delicate than the white and 
yolk of one. A teaspoonful of flour and a little lemon-grate are 
sometimes added. 

NO. 14. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR BRAIN CAKES. 

Boil the brains in a little good veal-gravv very gently for ten 
minutes ; drain them on a sieve, and when cold cut them into thick 
dice ; dip them into beaten yolk of egg, and then into very fine bread- 
crumbs, mixed with salt, pounded spices, and fine herbs minced 
extremely small; fry them of a light brown, drain and dry them 
well, and drop them into the soup or hash after it is dished. When 
broth or gravy is not at hand, the brains may be boiled in water. 

NO. 15. CHESTNUT FORCEMEAT. 

Strip the outer skin from some fine sound chestnuts, then thro^vr 
them into a saucepan of hot water, and set them over the fire for a 
minute or two, when they may easily be blanched like almonds. Put 
them into cold water as they are peeled. Dry them in a cloth, and 
weigh them. Stew six ounces of them very gently from fifteen to 
twenty minutca in just sufficient strong veal-graYy to cover thenu 



CHAP, vm.] FOBCEMEATS. 163 

Take them np, drain them on a sieve, and when cold ponnd them 
perfectly smooth with half their weight of the nicest bacon rasped 
dear from all rust or fibre, or with an equal quantity of fresh butter, 
two ounces of diy bread- crumbs, a small teaspoonful of grated lemon 
rind, one of salt, half as much mace or nutmeg, a moderate quantil^ 
of cayenne, and the unbeaten yolks of two or of three eggs. This 
mixture makes most excellent forcemeat cakes, which must he moulded 
with a knife, a spoon, or the fingers, dipped in flour ; more should be 
dredged over, and pressed upon them, and they should be slowly fried 
from ten to fifteen minutes. 

Chestnuts, 6 oz.; yeal-gravy, ) of a pint: 15 to 20 minutes. 
Bacon or butter, 3 oz. ; bread-crumbs, 2 oz. ; lemon-peel and salt, 
1 teaspoonful each. 

KG. 16. AN EXCELLENT FRENCH FORCEMEAT. 

Take six ounces of yeal free from fat and skin, cut it into dice and 
pot it into a saucejnn with two ounces of butter, a large teaspoonful 
of parsley finely minced, half as much thyme, salt, and grated lemon- 
rind, and a sufficient seasoning of nutmeg, cayenne, and maoe, to 
flayour it pleasantly. Stew these tfery gentlr irom twelye to fifteen 
minutes, then lift out the yeal and put into the saucepan two ounces 
of bread-crumbs; let them simmer until they haye absorbed the 
gr«vj yielded by the meat ; keep them stirred until they are as dry 
as possible; beat the yolk of an egg to them while they are hot, and 
set them asde to cool. Mince and pound the v^eal, add the bread to 
it 88 soon as it is cold, beat them well together, with an ounce and a 
half of fresh butter, and two of the finest bacon, quite freed from rust, 
and scraped clear of skin and fibre; put to them the yolks of two 
small ^gs and mix them well; then take the forcemeat from the 
mortar, and set it in a yery cool place until it is wanted for use. 

Yeal, 6 oz.; butter, 2 oz.; minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful; thyme, 
salt, and lemon-peel, each i teaspoonful; little nutmeg, cayenne, and 
mace: 12 to 15 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 2 oz.; butter, 1^ oz.; 
rasped bacon, 2 oz. ; yolk of eggs, 2 to 3. 

Ob9. — ^When this forcemeat is intended to fill boned fowls, the 
iiyers of two or three boiled for four minutes, or stewed with the yeal 
ibr the same length of time, then minced and pounded with the other 
ingredients, will be found a great improyement; and, if mushrooms 
can be procured, two tablespoonsful of them chopped small, should 
be stewed and beaten with it also. A small portion of the best end of 
the neck will afford the quantity of lean required for this receipt, and 
the remains of it will ma&e excellent grayy. 

NO. 17. FRENCH FORCEMEAT CALLED QUENELLES. 

Tius is a peculiarly light and delicate kind of forcemeat, which by 
good French cooks is compounded with exceeding care. It is seryed 



164 MODEBN COOKEfiT. [cHAP.vn^ 

abroad in a variety of forms, and is made of very finely •grained white 
veal, or of the undressed flesh of poultry, or of rabbits, rasped quite 
free from sinew, then chopped and pounded to the finest paste, first 
by itself, and afterwards with an equal quantity of boiled calf s udder 
or of butter, and of panada, which is out another name for bread 
soaked in cream or gravy and then dried over the fire until it forms a 
sort of paste. As the three ingredients should be equal in volume^ 
not in weight, they are each rofled into a separate ball before they 
are mixed, that their size majr be determined by the eve. When the 
fat of the fillet of veal (which in England is not onen divided for 
sale, as it is in France) is not to be procured, a rather less proportion 
of butter will serve in its stead. The following will be found a very 
good, and not a troublesome receipt for veal forcemeat of this kind. 

Rasp quite dear from sinew, after the fat and skin have been 
entirely cleared from it, four ounces of the finest veal; chop, and 
pound it well : if it be carefully prepared there will be no necessity 
for passing it through a sieve, but this should otherwise be done. 
Soak in a small saucepan two ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf in a 
little rich but pole v^ gravy or white sauce ; then ^ress and drain 
as much as possible of the moisture from it, and stir it over a gentle 
fire until it is as dry as it will become without burning : it will ^Ihere 
in a ball to the spoon, and leave the saucepan auite tlry when it is 
sufficiently done. Mix with it, while it is still not, the yolk of one 
egg, and when it is quite cold, add it to the veal with three ounces of 
very fresh butter, a quarter of a teaspoonful of mace, half as much 
cayenne, a little nutmeg, and a saltspoonful of salt. When these are 
perfectly beaten and well blended together, add another whole egg 
after having merely taken out the specks : the mixture will then be 
ready for use, and may be moulded into balls, or small thick oval 
shapes a little flattened, and poached in soup or gravy from ten to 
fifteen minutes. These quenelles may be served by themselves in a 
rich sauce as a comer dish, or in conjunction with other things. 
They may likewise be first poached for three or four minutes, and left 
on a drainer to become cold ; then dipped into egg and the finest 
bread-crumbs and fried, and served as croquettes. 

NO. 18. FORCEMEAT FOR RAISED AND OTHER COLD PIES. 

The very finest sausage-meat highly seasoned, and made with an 
equal proportion of fat and lean, is an exceedingly good forcemeat for 
veal, chicKen, rabbit, and some few other pies ; savoury herbs minced 
small may be added to heighten its flavour if it be intended for 
immediate eating ; but it wm not then remain good quite so long, 
unless they should have been pre\dously dried. To prevent its beings 
too dry, two or three spoonsful of cold water should be mixed with it 
l)efore it is put into the pie. One pound of lean veal to one and a 
quarter of the pork-fat is sometimes used, and smoothly pounded 



CHAP.Tin.l F0BCEMBAT8. 165 

-with a high seasoning of spices, herhs, and eschalots, or garlic; but 
we cannot recommend the introduction of these last into pies unless 
they are especiallj ordered: mushrooms or truffles maj be mixed 
with any kmd of forcemeat with far better effect Equal parts of 
yeal and fat bacon, will also make a good forcemeat for pies, if 
chopped finely, and well spiced. 

^usage-meat, well seasoned. Or : yeal, 1 lb. ; pork-fat, H lb. ; 
salt, 1 oz. ; pepper, i to ^ oz. ; fine herbs, spice, &c., as in forcemeat 
No. 1, or sausage-meat. Or : yeal and bacon, equal weight, seasoned 
in the same way. 

PANADA. 

This is the name giyen to the soaked bread which is mixed with 
the French forcemeats, and which renders them so peculiarly delicate. 
Pour on the crumb of two or three rolls, or on that of any other 
yery light bread, as much good boiling broth, milk, or cream, as will 
coyer and moisten it well ; put a plate oyer to keep in the steam, and 
let it remain for half an hour, or more ; then drain off the super- 
fluous liquid, and squeeze the panada diy by wringing it in a thin 
cloth into a ball ; put it into a small stewpan or enamelled saucepan, 
and. pour to it as much only of rich white sauce or of grayy as it can 
easily absorb, and stir it constantly with a wooden spoon oyer a clear 
and gentle fire, until it forms a yery dry })aste and adheres in a mass 
to the spoon; when it is in this state, mix with it thoroughly the 
unbeaten yolks of two fresh eggs, which will ^ye it firmness, and set 
it aside to become quite cold before it is put into the mortar. The 
best French cooks giye the highest degree of sayour that they can to 
this panada, and add no other seasoning to the forcemeats of which it 
forms a part : it is used in an equal proportion with the meat, and 
with the calTs udder or butter of which they are composed, as we 
haye shown in the preceding receipt for queneUes. They stew slowly 
for the purpose, a small bit of lean ham, two or three minced escha- 
lots, a bayleaf, a few mushrooms, a little parsley, a cloye or two, and 
a small blade of mace in a little good butter, and when they are 
sofiSciently browned, pour to them as much broUi or grayy as will be 
needed for the panada; and when this has simmered from twenty to 
thirty minutes, so as to haye ac(^uired the propter flayour without 
being much reduced, they strain it oyer, and boil it into the bread. 
Hie common course of cookery in an English kitchen does not oilen 
require the practice of the greater niceties and refinements of the art: 
and irovble (of which the French appear to be perfectly regardless 
when the excellence of their preparations is concerned) is tnere in 
general so much thought of, and exclaimed against, that a more 
smnmary process would probably meet with a better chance of 



A quicker and rougher mode of making the panada, and indeed

the forcemeat altogether, is to pour strong veal broth or gravy upon 
itf and after it has soaked, to boil it dry, without any addition except 
that of a little fine spice, lemon-grate, or any other favourite English 
seasoning. Minced herbs, salt, cayenne, and mace, may be b^ten 
with the meat, to which a small portion of well-pounded ham may 
likewise be added at pleasure.

CHAPTER DL 

A noBouoH practical knowledge of the proceflses described in the 
present chapter will form a reuly good cook far sooner and more 
completely than any array of mere receipts can do, however minutely 
they may be explained ; they should, therefore, be well studied and 
eomprehended, before any attempt is made to compoun d difficult 
dishes; and the principles of roasting, boiling, stewing, and baking, 
at least, ooght to be clearly understood by every servant who under- 
takes the duties of what is called z>2asn cookery^ which is, in fact, of 
more importance than any other, because it is in almost universal 
request m this country for families of moderate fortune ; and an^ 
person who excels in it wiU easily become expert in what are consi- 
dered the higher branches of the art. 

In a vast number of English kitchens the cookery fails from the 
hurried manner in which it is conducted, and from the excess of heat 
produced by the enormous coal-fires constantly kept burning there 
at all seasons, without which ignorant servants imagme no dinner can 
be properly cooked; a mistake which cannot fail quickly to become 
i^iparent to the most inexperienced reader who will give a natient 
trial to the slow methods cdT cooking recommended in the following 
pages. These wiU be found to combine exceeding economy in the 
consumption of fuel, with a degree of superiority in the food prepared 
by them, which would scarcely be credited unless it were put to the 
t^t.. In stewing, and baking in closely covered vessels, this supe- 
riority is more particularly remarkable; and we would willingly give 
a fiur laiver space to so useful a subject than our limits will permit : 
we are, however, compelled, though with re^t, to restrict ourselves 
to such details as we have now supplied m various parts pi this 
ToLume. 

TO BOIL MEAT. 

BoiHng, in the usual English manner, is the least advanta^ous of 
■11 modet of cooking meat, ^cause a larise portion of the nounshment 




168 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. iz. 

which it contains is withdrawn from it in 
the process, and it is usually very insipid. 
in flavour. 

We have aleady given, at the com- 
mencement of Chapter I., the suhstanoe 
of Liebeg*8 instructions for scientific boil- 
ing ; but for the convenience of the reader, 
we will briefly recapitulate them here, 
with such additions as our own obserrA- 
Iron Boiler. tloiL has enabled us to supply. 

In making soup, gravy, or savoury jelly of any kin'd, the principal 
object is to extract from the meat used for the preparation, all tlie 
nutriment and savour which it can be made to yield. This is eflTectedl 
by putting it into cold water, and heating it very slowly indeed, and. 
then keeping it for a specified time at the point of boiling, or letting 
it simmer in the gentlest manner ; but when the meat itself is required 
for food, its nutritious juices must be prevented from escaping as 
much as possible, which is done by plunging it into fast boiling water 
for a few minutes, to contract the pores of the surface (to ha^en it* 
in fact), and addinff immediately afterwards as much cold water aa 
will reduce the whme to a moderate temperature. Fart of the water 
should then be taken away, as meat snould never be cooked ia a 
larger quantity than is absolutely needed to keep it entirely covered 
until it is readv to serve ; for tms reason it should be always boiled 
in a vessel nearly of its own size. 

Large joints should be neatly trimmed, washed extremely o^t^n^ 
and skewered or bound firmly mto good shape, when they are of a 
nature to require it ; brought to boil over a moderate fire, and sim- 
mer^ imtil they are done, the scum being carefully and entirelv 
cleared from the surface of the water, as it ^thers there, which will 
be principaUy from within a few minutes of its beginning to boil, and 
during a few minutes afterwards. If not thorougnly skimmed ofiT at 
the proper time, it will sink, and adhere to the joint, giving it a very 
uninvitmg appearance. 

Pickled or salted meat requires longer boiling than fresh ; and tliat 
which is smoked and dried longer still : this last should always be 
laid into cold water, slowly heated, and if, from anv circumstances^ 
time cannot have been allowed for soaking it properly and there is a 
probability of its being too salt when served, it should be brought 
very softly to boil in a laige quantity of water, which should in part 
be changed as soon as it becomes quite briny, for as much more that 
is ready boiling. 

It is customary to lay rounds of beef, and other large joints, upon 
a fish-plate, or to throw some wooden skewers under them, to prevent 
their sticking to the vessel in which they are cooked ; and it is aa 
well to take the precaution, though unless they be placed over a very 
fierce fire, they cannot be in danger of this. The time allowed lor 
tiiem is about the same as for roasting, from fifteen to twenty minates

to the pound. For cooking rounds of beef^ 
ind other ponderous joints, a pan of this 
form is very conyenient. 

By means of two almost equally expen- 
sive preparations, called &poelee^ and a blanc^ 
the insipidity which results from boiling 
meat or vegetables in water only may be 
removed, and the whiteness of either will be 
better preserved. Turkeys, fowls, sweet- Large stockpot 

breads, calTs brains, cauliflowers, and artichoke bottoms, are the 
articles for which the ooelee and the blanc are more especially used in 
expensive foreign cooKery : the reader will jud^e by the following 
receipts how far they are admissible into that of Sie economist. 

po&l£e. 

Cut into large dice two pounds of lean veal, and two pounds of fat 
bacon cured without saltpetre, two large carrots, and two onions ; to 
these add half a pound of fresh butter, put the whole into a stewpan, 
and stir it with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire until the veal is 
very white, and the bacon is partially melted ; then pour to them 
three pints of clear boiling broth or water, throw in four cloves, a 
small bunch or two of thyme and parsley, a bay-leaf, and a few corns 
of white pepper ; boil these gently for an hour and a half, then strain 
the po^Se through a fine sieve, and set it by in a cool place. Use it 
instead of water for boiling the various articles we nave already 
named : it will answer for several in succession, and will remain good 
for many days. Some cooks order a pound of butter in addition to 
the bacon, and others substitute beef-suet in part for this last. 

A BLANC. 

Put into a stewpan one pound of fat bacon rasped, one pound of 
beef-suet cut small, and one pound of butter ; the strained juice of 
two lemons, a couple of bay-leaves, three cloves, three carrots, and 
three onions divided into dice, and less than half a pint of water. 
Simmer these gently, keeping them often stirred, until the fat is well 
melted, and the water has evaporated ; then pour in rather more than 
will be required for the dish which is to be cooked in the blanc ; boil 
it softly until all the ingredients have given out their full flavour, 
ddm it well, add salt if needed, and strain it off for use. A calTs head 
is oflen boiled in this. 



ROASTING. 



Boasting, which is quite the favourite mode of dressing meat in 
this country, and one in which the English are thought to excel, 
requires unremitting attention on the p^ of tiie cook rather than

any great exertion of skill. Large 
kitchens are usually fitted with a smoke- 
jack, bv means of which several spits if 
needful can be kept turning at the same 
time; but in sinall establishments, a 
roaster which allows of some economy 
in point of fuel is more commonly used. 
That shown in the print is of very ad- 
vanta^us construction in this respect, 
as a joint may be cooked in it with a 
comparatively small fire, the heat being 
strongly reflected from the scieen upon 
the meat: in consequence of this, it 
should never be placed very close to 
the grate, as the surface of the joint 
wouM then become dry and hard. 

A more convenient form of roaster,, 
with a spit placed horizontally, and 
turned by means of a wheel and chain, 
of which the movement is regulated by 
a spring contained in a box at the top, 
is of the same economical order as ihe one above; but eaters of very 

delicate taste urge, as an objection to 
this apparatus, as well as to that shown 
above, that the meat cooked in either, 
derives from the tin by which it is 
dosely surrounded, the flavour of baJked 
meat. The bottle-jack, with a common 
roasting-screen containing shelves for 
warming plates and dishes, and other 
purposes, is not liable to the same ob- 

^^ jection. To roast well with it (or with 

*^ p=3 viii^ ® * smoke-jack), make up a fire propor- 

v^^ o S^^^f^ tioned in width and height to the joint 

which is to be roasted, and which it 
should surpass in dimensions every way, 
by two or three inches. Place some 
moderate-sized lumps of coal on the 
top; let it be free from smoke and 
improyed Spring Jack. ashes in front; and so compactly ar- 

ranged that it will neither require to be disturbed, nor supplied with 
fresh fuel, for some considerable time after the meat is laid down. Spit 
or suspend the joint, and place it very far from the fire at first ; keep it 
constantly basted, and when it is two parts done, move it nearer to the 
fire that it may be properly browned; but guard carefully against its

being burned. A few minutes before it is taken from the spit, sprinkle 
ft little fine salt oyer it, baste it thoroughly with its own dripping, 
or with butter, and dredge it with flour : as soon as the froth is well 
liaen, dish, and serve the meat. Or, to ayoid the necessity of the froth- 
ixif which is often greatly objected to on account of the raw taste re- 
tamed by the flour, dredge the roast liberally soon after it is first laid 
to the fire ; the flour will then form a savoury incrustation upon it, 
and assist to prevent the escape of its juices. When meat or poultry is 
wrapped in buttered p^per it must not be floured until this is removed, 
which should be fifteen or twenty minutes before either is served. 

Bazxm Liebeg, whom we have already so often quoted, says, that 
roasting should be conducted on the same principle as boiling ; and 
that sufficient heat should be applied to the surface of the meat at 
onoe, to contract the pores and prevent the escape of its juices; and 
that the remainder of^the process should be slow. When a joint is 
first laid to the fire, therefore, it should bo placed for twenty minutes 
or half an hour sufficiently near to eflect this, without any part, and 
the fat especially, being allowed to acquire more than the slightest 
colour, and then drawn back and finished by the directions at the end 
«f this section. 

The speedy application of very hot basting-fat to every part of the 
meat, would probably be attended with the same result as subiecting 
it to the full action of the fire. It is certain that roasts which are 
constantly and carefully basted are always very superior to those 
which are neglected in this respect. 

Bemember always to draw back the dripping-pan when the fire 
has to be stirred, or when fresh coals are thrown on, that the cinders 
and ashes may not fall into it. 

When meat is very lean, a slice of butter, or a small <^uantity of 
clarified dripping, should be melted in the pan to baste it with at m-st ; 
though the use of the latter should be scrupulously avoided for poul- 
try, or any delicate meats, as the flavour it imparts is to many persons 
peculiarly objectionable. Let the spit be kept bright and dean, and 
wipe it before the meat is put on ; balance the joint well upon it, that 
it may turn st^idily, and if needful secure it with screw-skewers. A 
cradle spit, which b so constructed that it contains the meat in a sort 
of framework, instead of passing through it, may be often very 
advantageously used insteaa of an ordinary one, as the perforation of 
the meat by this last must always occasion some escape of the juices ; 
and it is, moreover, particularly to be objected to in roasting joints or 
poultiy which have been boned and filled with forcemeat. The 
cradle spit (for which see ** Turkey Boned and Forced," Chapter 
XIV.) IS much better suited to these, as well as to a sucking pig, 
stuigeon, salmon, and other large fish ; but it is not very common^ 
to be found in our kitchens, many of which exhibit a singular scanti- 
ness of the conveniences which assist the labours of the cook. 

For heavy and substantial joints, a quarter of an hour is generally 
allowed for every pound of meat ; and with a sound fire and frequent

basting, will be found safficient when the process is condueted in the 
usual manner ; but bv the slow metiiad^ss we shall designate it, almost 
double the time will be required. Fork, veal, and lamb, should 
always be well roasted; but many eaters prefer mutton and beef 
rather under-dressed, though some persons have a strong objection to 
the sight even of any meat that is not thoroughly cooked. 

Joints which are thin in proportion to their weight, require less of 
the fire than thick and solid ones. Ribs of beef, for example, will be 
sooner ready to serve than an equal weight of the rump, round, or 
sirloin ; and the neck or shoulder of mutton, or spare rib of pork, 
than the leg. 

When to preserve the succulence of the meat is more an object 
than to economise fuel, beef and mutton should be laid at twice the 
usual distance from the fire, after the surface has been thoroughly 
heated, as directed bv Licbeg, and allowed to remain so until they 
are perfectly heated through ; the roasting, so managed, will of course 
be slow; and from three hours and a half to four hours will be 
necessary to cook by this method a leg of mutton of ordinary size, 
for which two hours would amply suffice in a common way; but the 
flesh will be remarkably tender, and the flow of gravy from it most 
abundant. It should not be drawn near the fire imtil within the last 
half or diree quarters of an hour, and should then be placed only so 
close as to brown it properly. No kind of roast indeed should at any 
time be allowed to take colour too quickly; it should be heated ^- 
dually, and kept at least at a moderate distance from the fire until it 
is nearly done, or the outside will be dry and hard, if not bumedt 
while the inside will be only half cooked. 

STCAMINQ. 

The application of steam to culinary pur 
poses is becoming rery general in our kitch- 
ens at the present day, especially in those 
of larffe establishments, many of which are 
furnished with apparatus for its use, so 
admirably constructed and so complete, that 
the process may be conducted on an exten- 
sive scale with very slight trouble to the 

saucepan ^-ith steamer. ^^'^ *P*^ ^9 ^he further advantage of 
being at a distance from thefire^ the steam 
beinff conveyed by pipes to the vessels intended to receive it. Fish, 
butcher's meat, poultry, vegetables, puddings, maccaroni, and rice, 
are all subjected to its action, instead of being immersed in water, as 
in simple boiling: and the result is to many persons perfectly satia- 
£ictory ; though, as there is a diflerence of opinion amongst first-rate 
cooks, with regard to the comparative ments of the two modes of 
dressing meat and fish^ a trial should be given to the steaming on a 
■mall scale, before any great expenses are mcurred for it, whicn may 




CHAP. IX.] BOILING^ BOASTING^ £TC. 173 

be done eaaly with a common saucepan or boiler, fitted like the one 
shown above, with a simple tin steamer. Servants not accustomed to 
the use of these, should be warned against boiling in the vessel itself 
any thing of coarse or strong flavour, when the article steamed is of 
a delicate nature. The vapour from soup containing onions, for 
example, would have a very bad effect on a sweet pudding, and on 
many other dishes. Care and discretion, therefore, must be exercised 
on this point. By means of a kettle fixed over it, the steam of the 
boiler in the kitchen range may be made available for cooking, in the 
way shown by the engraving, which exhi- n 
bits fish, potatoes, and their sauces, all in /^PvT\j^^^^^:p 
progress of steaming at the same time.* ^ v^V*^ zr ^o 
The limits of our work do not permit us 
to enter at much length upon this subject, 
but the reader who may wish to under- 
stand the nature of steam, and the various 
modes in which its agency may be applied 
to domestic purposes, will do well to con- 
sult Mr. Webster's excellent work,t of 

which we have more jMirticularly spoken 
in another chapter. The quite inexperienced cook may require to be 
told, that any article of food which is to be cooked by steam in a 
saucepan of the form exhibited in the first of the engravings of this 
section, must be prepared exactly as for boiling, and laid into the sort 
of strainer affixed to the top of the saucepan ; and that water, or some 
other kind of liquid, must be put into the saucepan itself, and kept 
boiling in it, the lid being first closely fixed into the steamer. 

STEWING. 

rhis very wholesome, convenient, and economical mode of cookery 
is by no means so well imderstood nor profited by in England as on 
the continent, where its advantages are fully appreciated. So very 
small a quantity of fuel is necessary to sustain the gentle degree of 
ebullition which it requires, that this alone would recommend it to 
the careful housekeeper ; but if the process be skilfully conducted, 
meat softly stoved or stewed, in close-shutting, or luted | vessels, is 
in every respect equal, if not superior, to that which is roasted ; but 
it must be simmered only, and in the gentlest possible manner, or, 
instead of being tender, nutritious, and highly palatable, it will be 
dry, hard, and indigestible. The common cooking stoves in this 
country, as they have hitherto been constructed, have rendered the 
exact regulation of heat which stewing requires rather difficult ; and

the smoke and blaze of a laige coal fire are yeiy unfayonrable to 

many other modes of cookery as 
well. The French have generally 
the advantage of the embers and 
ashes of the wood which is their 
ordinary fuel; and they have 
always, m addition, a stove of this 
construction, in which charcoal 
or braise (for explanation of this 
word, see remarks on preserving, 
Chapter XXV.") only is burned ; 
and upon which their stewpans 
can, wnen there is occasion, be 
left uncovered, without the dan- 
ger of their contents being spoiled, which there generally is with us. 
y^ yr—, , -=j — p=r~\ It w true, that of late great improvements 
y^^y^^_^^ E\ \ have been made in our own stoves ; and 
the hot plates, or hearths with which the 
kitchens of good houses are always fur- 
nished, are admirably adapted to the sim- 
mering system ; but when the cook has not 
the convenience of one, the stewpans must 
be placed on trivets high above the fire, and be constantly watched, 
and moved, as occasion may require, nearer to, or further from the 
flame. 

No copper vessels from which the inner tinning is in the slightest 
degree worn away should be used ever for this or for any other kind 
of cookery ; or not health only, but life itself, may be endangered by 
them.* We have ourselves seen a dish of acid fruit which had been 
boiled without sugar in a copper pan from which the tin linuig was 
half worn away, coated with verdigris after it had become cold ; and 
from the careless habits of the person who had prepared it^ the 
chances were greatly in favour of its being served to a family after- 
wards, if it had not been accidentally discovered* Salt acts upon the 
copper in the same manner as acids : vegetables, too, from the portion 
of the latter which they contain, have the same injurious efiect, and 
the greatest danger results from allowing preparations containing any 
of these to become cold (or cool) in the ste>vpan, in contact with the 
exposed part of the copper in the inside. Thick, well-tinned iron 
saucepans will answer for all the ordinary purposes of common 
English cookery, even for stewing, provided they have tightly-fitting 
lids to prevent the escape of the steam ; but the copper ones are of 
more convenient form, and better adapted to a suf^or order of 
cookery. 

* Sugar, being an antidote to the poisonous effects of Terdigris, ehonld be 
plentifully taken, dissoJved in water, so as to form a iymp, by persona who may 
unfortunately have partaken of any dish into which this duigerous ingrediexi 
has entered. 



CHAP. IX.] STEWING AND BBOILING. 175 

The enamelled stewpans and saucepans which have now very much 
Euperseded the old-fashioned metal ones for many purposes, are 
peculiarly suited, from the nicety of the composition with which they 
are lined, and which resemhles earthenware, to the preparation of 
fine preserves, and all very delicate compounds, as well as to those of 
milk, and of various articles of diet adapted to invalids ; and they 
possess the further advantage of being easily kept beautifully dean. 
Care should be taken not to allow anything which they may contain 
to bum to them, which it will quickly do if they be placed flat upon 
a fierce fire ; and when this has once occurred, there will always be 
some difficulty in preventing their contents from adhering to them 
where they have been burned. They should always be filed with 
water immediately after being emptied, and will then merely require 
to be well washed and rinsed with more boiling water ; but when 
they have been neglected, strong soda and water would be boiled in 
them for a few minutes. 

BROILINO. 

Broiling is the best xKtssible mode of cooking and of preserving the 
flavour of several kinds of fish, amongst which we may spedfy 
mackerel and whitings ; it is also 
incomparably superior to frying for 
steaks and cutlets, especially of 
beef and mutton ; and it is far better 
adapted also, to the preparation of 
food for invalids ; but it should be 
carefully done, for if the heat be 
too fierce, the outside of the meat 
will be scorched and hardened so as 
to render it imeatable ; and if, on 
the contrary, it be too gentle, the a Conjuror. 

gravy will be drawn out, and yet the flesh will remain so entirely 
without firmness, as to be unpleasant eating. A brisk fire, perfectly 
/reejram smoke^ a very clean gridiron, tender meat, a dish and plates 
as hot as they can be, and great despatch in sending it to table when 
done, all are essential to the servins of a good broS. The gridiron 
should be heated, and rubbed with mutton suet before the meat is 
laid on, and it should be placed slopingly over the fire, that the fat 
may run off to the back of the grate, instead of falling on the live 
coals and smoking the meat : if this precaution should not prevent its 
making an occasional blaze, lifl; the gridiron quickly beyond the 
reach of the smoke, and hold it away until the fire is dear again. 
Steaks and chops should be turned often, that the juices may be ke^t 
in, and tihiat tiiey may be equally done in every part If, for this 
purpose, it should be necessary for want of steak-tongs to use a fork, 
U should be passed through the outer skin or fat of the steak, but 
never stuck into the lean, as by that means much of the gravy will

escape. Most eaten prefer broiled beef or mntton, rather under- 
dressed; but lamb or pork cutlets should always be thoroug^hl^ 
cooked. When a fowl or any other bird is cut asunder before it is 
broiled, the inside should first be laid to the fire : this should be 
done with kidneys also. Fish is less dry and of better flavour, as 
well as less liable to be smoked, if it be wrapped in a thickly buttered 
sheet of writing paper before it is placed on the gridiron. For the 
more delicate-skinned kinds, the bars should be rubbed with chalk 
instead of suet when the paper is omitted. Cutlets, or meats of any 
other form, when e^ed and crumbed for broiling, should afterwards 
be dipped into dari^d butter or sprinkled with it plentifully, as the 
egg-yolk and bread will otherwise form too dry a crust upon it. 
2*rench cooks season their cutlets both with salt and pepper, and 
brush a little oil or butter over them to keep them moist; but unless 
this be done, no seasoning of salt should be given them until they are 
just ready to be dished : the French method is a very good one. 

Steaks or cutlets may be quickly cooked with a sheet or two of 
lighted paper onl^, in the apparatus shown in the preceding page, 
and called a conjuror. Lift off the cover and lay in the meat 
properly seasoned, with a small slice of butter under it, and insert 
the lighted paper in the aperture shown in the plate ; in from eight 
to ten minutes the meat will be done, and found to be remarkably 
tender, and very palatable: it must be turned and moved occa- 
sionalljr during the process. This is an especially convenient mode 
of cooking for persons whose hours of dining are rendered uncertain 
by the nature of their avocations. For medical men engaged in 
extensive country practice it has often proved so ; and we would 
especially recommend it to the notice of emigrants, to whom it would 
often prove invaluable. The part in which the meat is placed is of 
block tin, and fits closely into the stand, which is of sheet iron. 
The conjuror from which our design was drawn, was purchased in 
a country town in Essex, and was exceedingly well made, and very 
cheap. We find on inquiry that the maker has quitted the place, or 
we would insert his address. 

PRYINO. 

This is an operation', which, though appa* 
rently very simple, requires to be more care- 
ftilly and skilfully conducted than it commonly 

is. Its success depends principally on allowing

this be neglected, the article fried will be saturated with fat, and

acquired before the cooking is complete, the pan should be placed 
high above the fire, that it may be continued slowly to the proper

point. Steaks and cutlets should be seasoned with salt and pq>per^ 
and dredged on both sides lightly \nth flour before they are laid into 
the pan, in which they should be often moved and turned that they 
may be equally done, and that they may not stick nor bum to it. 
From ten to fifteen minutes will fry them. They should be evenly 
sliced, about the same thickness as for broiling, and neatly trimmed 
and divided in the first instance. Lift them mto a hot dish when 
done ; pour the fat from the nan, and throw in a small slice of butter ; 
stir to this a large teaspoonful of flour, brown it gently, and pour in 
by degrees a quarter of a pint of hot broth or water ; shake the 
pan well round, add pepper, salt, and a little good catsup, or any 
other store sauce which may be preferred to it, and pour the gravy 
over the steaks : this is the most common mode of saucing and 
serving them. 

Minute directions for fish, vegetables, omlets, and diflerent pre- 
parations of batter, are given in their proper places ; but we must 
acain observe, that a veiy small fr3dng pan (scarcely larger than a 
dmner-plate) is necessary for manv of these ; and, indeed, the large 
and thick one suited to meat and fish, and used commonly for them is 
alto^her unfit for nicer purposes. 

l%e ioute-pan, shown in the preceding page, is much used by 
French cooks instead of a frying-pan ; it is more particularlv con- 
venient for tossing quickly over the fire small collops, or aught else 
which requires but little cooking. 

All fried dishes, which are not sauced, should be served extremely 
djy upon a neatly-folded damask cloth : they are best drained upon 
a sieve reversed placed before the fire. 

A wire basket of this form is convenient for frying parsley and 
other herbs. It must be plac^ in 
o pan well filled with fat, and lifted 
out quickly when the herbs are done : 
they may likewise be crisped in it 
over a clear fire, without any fat.

nature, that no cook who is expected to serve them in the best 
manner should be without one. They should all be arranged upon

BAKING^ OB OVEN COOKKBY. 

The improYed construction of the 
oyens connected with all modem 
cooking stoves, gives great facility at 
the present day for home bakings even 
in very small establishments ; and 
without this convenience it is impos- 
sible for justice to be done to the 
person who conducts the cookery; as 
Nottingham Jar. many and great disadvantages attend the 

sending to a public oven ; and it is very cuscouraging to a servant who 
has prepared her dishes with nicety and skill, to nave them injured 
by the negligence of other persons. One of the best modes of 
cooking with which we are acquainted is by means of a jar, resem- 
bling in form that shown above, well pasted down, and covered with 
a fold of thick paper, and then placed in a gentle oven. Rice is 
most excellent when thus slowly baked with a certain proportion of 
liquid, either by itself, or mingled with meat, fish, or miit; but we 
must reserve for another volume particulars of this little system of 
slow oveu'Cooheryy in which for some years past we have had num- 
berless experiments made with almost uniform success : it is espe- 
cially suited to invalids, from preserving the entire amount of 
nourishment contained in the articles of food dressed by it ; and it is 
to their use that we hope to appropriate it. 

The oven may be used with advanta^ for many purposes for 
which it is not commonly put into requisition. Calves' feet, covered 
with a proper proportion of water, may be reduced to a strong Jelly 
if left in it for some hours ; the half-head, boned and rolled, will be 
foimd excellent eating, if laid, with 
the bones, into a deep pan and baked 
quite tender in sufficient broth or 
water, to keep it covered in every part 
until done ; good soup also may be 
made in the same way, the usual in- 
gredients being at once added to the 
meat, with the exception of the vege- 
tables, which will not become tender 
if put into cold li(}uid, and should 
therefore be thrown m aJder it begins

* We have scarcely done justice in the former editions of this work to these 
very useful litUe ovens, which we have found, after long trial, better adapted to 
some purposes than brick or iron ones, because preparations which require it, 
(those of Indian com, for example) can be heated in them more gradually ; and 
when once the management of them is understood, they will answer admu«bly 
for delicate sweet puddings, and for cakes, with the adrantage of requiring bat » 
very moderate firt.

the best modes of dressing varions kinds of fish : pike and red mullet 
amongst others. Sahnon cut into thick slices, freed from the skin, 
well seasoned with spice, mixed with salt (and with minced herbs, at 
pleasure), then arranged evenly in a dish, and covered thickly Tvith 
erombs of bread, moistened with clarified batter, as directed in 
Chapter 11., for baked soles, and placed in the oven for about half an 
hour, will be found yerv rich and highly flavoured. Part of the 
middle of the salmon left entire, well cleaned, and thoroughly- 
dried, then seasoned, and securely wrapped in two or three fol^ 
of thickly buttered paper, will also proVe excellent eating, if 
gently baked. (This may likewise be roasted in a Dutch oven» 
either folded in the paper, or left without it, and basted with 
batter.) 

Hama, when freshly cured, and not over salted, if neatly trimmed, 
sod covered with a coarse paste, are both more juicy, and of finer 
flavour baked than boiled. Savoury or pickled beef too, put into a 
deep pan with a little gravy, and plenty of butter or diopped suet 
on the top, to prevent the outside from becoming dry ; then covered 
with paste, or with several folds of thick paper, and set into a 
moderate oven for four or five hours, or even longer, if it be of 
lam weight, is an excellent dish. A goose, a leg of pork, and a 
sucking jag, if properly attended to whOe in the oven, are said to be 
nearly, or quite as good as if roasted ; but baking is both an un- 
palatable and an unprofitable mode of cooking joints of meat in 
general, though its great convenience to many persons who have but 
&w other lacuities for obtaining the luxury of a hot dinner renders 
it a very common one. 

It is usual to raise meat from the dish in which it is sent to the 
oven by placing it, properly skewered, on a stand, so as to allow 
potatoes or a batter pudding to be baked under it. A few button 
onions, freed from the outer skin, or three or four large ones, cut in 
halves, are sometimes put beneath a shoulder of mutton. Two 
sheets of paper spread separately with a thick layer of butter, cla- 
iified marrow, or any other fat, and fastened securely over the out- 
ade of a joint, will prevent its being too much dried by the fierce 
heat of the oven. A few spoonsful of water or gravy should be 
poured into the dish with potatoes, and a little salt sprinkled over 
them. 

A celebrated French cook recommends braising in the oven ; that is 
to say, after the meat has been arranged in the usual manner, and 
just brought to boil over the fire, that the braising pan, closely- 
stopped, uionld be put into a moderate oven, for the same length 
of time as would be required to stew the meat perfectly 
tender.

BRAISING. 



Braising is but a more expensive mode of stewing meat The 
following French recipe will explain the process. We would 
observe, however, that the layers of beef or veal, in which the 
=;55:^(^ joint to be braised is imbedded, can 
^ ''' afterwards be converted into excellent 
soup, ^vy, or glaze; and that there 
need, m consequence, be no waste nor 
any unreasonable degree of expense at- 
tending it ; but it is a troublesome pro- 
cess, and quite as good a result may be 
obtained by simmering the meat in very 
English BFaiBing-pan. gtrong gravy. Should the flavour of 

the bacon be considered an advantage, slices of it can be laid over 
the article braised, and secured to it with a fillet of tape. 

" To braise the inside (or small JUlet^ as it is called in France) of a 
sirloin of beef: Baise the fillet dean from the joint ; and with a 
sharp knife strip off all the skin, leaving the surface of the meat 
as smooth as possible ; have ready some stri^ of unsmoked bacon, 
half as thick as your little finger, roll them m a mixture of thyme 
finelv minced, spices in powder, and a little pepper and salt. Lard 
the fillet quite through vnith these, and tie it round with tape in any 
shape you choose. Line the bottom of a stewpan (or braising-pan) 
with sfices of bacon ; next put in a layer of beef or veal, four omons, 
two bay-leaves, two carrots, and a bunch of sweet herbs, and place 
the fillet on them. Cover it with slices of bacon, put some trim- 
mings of meat all round it, and pour on to it half a mnt of good beef 
broth or gravy. Let it stew as gently as possible for two hours and 
a half; teke it up, and keep it very hot; strain, and reduce the 
gravy by quick boiling until it is thick enough to glaze with ; brash 
the meat over with it ; put the rest in the dish with die fillet, after 
the tape has been removed from it, and send it directly to table." 

Equal parts of Madeira and gra^y are sometimes used to moisten 
the meat. 

^o attempt should be made to braise a joint in any vessel that is 
not very nearly of its own size 

A round of buttered paper is crenerally put over the more delicate 
kinds of braised meat, to prevent tLcir being browned by the fire, 
which in i ranee is sometimes put round the lid of the braising-pan, 
in a groove made on purpose to contain it. The embers of a wood 
fire mixed with the hot ashes, are best adapted to sustain the regular 
but gentle degree of heat required for this mode of cooking.

Braising pans are of various forms. They are often shaped like a 
ham-kettle, and sometimes like the design 
at the commencement of this section; but 
a stewpan of modem form, or any other

placed upon the lid, ynH answer for the 
purpose as well.

Copper Stewpan. 



Lordhig PlDB. 

Cut into slices, of the same length and thickness, some bacon of the 
finest quality ; trim away the outsidcs, place the slices evenly upon 
each other, and with a sharp knife diviae them obliquely into small 
strips of equal size. For pheasants, partridges, hares, fowls, and 
frieandecntXj the bacon should be about the eighth of an inch 
square, and two inches in length ; but for me^it which is to be larded 

Juite through, instead of on the outside merely, the bits of bacon 
properly <^ed lardoons) must be at least the third of an inch 
square. 

In general, the breasts only of birds are larded, the backs and 
thighs of hares, and the whole of the upper surface of ^fricandeau : 
these should be thickly covered with small lardoons, placed at re- 
gular intervals, and in lines which intersect each other, so as to form 
rather minute diamonds. 

The following directions for larding a pheasant will serve equally 
for poultry, or for other kinds of game : — 

Secure one end of the bacon in a slight larding-needle, and on 
the point of this take up sufficient of the flesh of the bird to hold 
the lardoon firmly ; draw the needle through it, and part of the 
bacon, of which the two ends should be left of equal length. Pro- 
ceed thus, until the breast of the pheasant is entirely garnished with 
' lardoons, when it ought to resemble in appearance a cake thickly 
stuck with strips of aunonds. 

The larger strips of bacon, after being rolled in a high seasoning 
of minced herbs and spices, are used to lard the inside of meat, and 
they should be proportioned to its thickness, as they must be passed 
quite through it. For example : a four-inch slice from a rump of 
beef will require lardoons of very nearly that length, which must be

drawn through with a large larding-pin, and left in it, with the ends 
just out of sight on either side. 

In France, truffles, anchovies, slices of tongue, and of &t, all 
trimmed into proper shape, are occasionally used for larding. The 
bacon employed there for the purpose is cured without any saltpetre 
(as this would redden the white meats), and it is never smoked : the 
receipt for it will be found in Chapter XTTT. 

A turkey is sometimes larded with alternate lardoons of fat bacon 
and of bullock's tongue, which has been pickled but not dried : we 
apprehend that the lean of a half-boiled ham, of good colour, would 
answer the purpose quite as well, or better. 

Larding the surface of meat, poultry, or game, gives it a good 
appearance, but it is a more positive improvement to meat of a drv 
nature to interlard the inside with laige lardoons of weU-seasoneay 
delicate^ striped English baoon. 



BONING. 

Yeiy minute directions being given in other parts of our yolume 
for this, we confine ourselves here to the following rules : — ^in disen- 
gaging the flesh from it, work the knife always twse to the bone^ and 
take every care not to pierce the outer skin. 

TO BLANCH MEAT OB YEOETABLES. 

This is merely to throw either into a pan of boiling wat^ for a 
few minutes, which gives firmness to the first, and is necessary for 
some modes of preparing vegetables. 

The breast only of a bird is sometimes held in the water while 
it boils, to render it firm for larding. To preserve the whiteness of 
meat, and the bright green of vegetables, they are lifted ftx>m the 
water after the^ have boiled a few minutes, and are thrown imme- 
diately into spnng water, and left till cold. 

5 to 10 minutes. 

GLAZING. 

This process we have explained at the 
article Glaze^ Chapter IV. The surfiue 
of the meat should be covered evenly, 
with two or three separate layers of the 
glaze, which, if properly made, soon be- 
comes firm. A ham should be wdl dried 
in the oven before it is laid on. Cutlets 
of all kinds may be e lazed before th^ 
are sent to table, with very good effect

order of cookery. A kitchen shoyel is sometimes substituted for it

TO CHOOSE BEEF. 

Beef is in realitj in season throngh the entire year, but it is best daring the 
winter months, when it will hang a sufficient time to become tender before it is 
dressed. Meat of a more delicate nature is better adapted for the table in sum- 
mer. The ChrUlnuu be^ of England is too much celebrated to require an/ 
mention here. 

If yoang and fireshly killed, the lean of ox-beef will be smootlily 
grained^ and of a fine, healthy, carnation-red, the fat ^ther white 
toaq yellow, and the suet white and firm. Heifer-beef m more 



CHAP. 2. J BEEF^ 185 

closely gprained, and rather less bright of colour, the bones are con- 
siderably smaller, and the fat of a purer white. 

Of bull-beef we only speak to warn our readers that it is of all 
meat the coarsest and the most rank in flavour. It may be known 
by its dark hue, its close tough fibre, and the scanty proportion, bad 
appearance, and strong odour of its fat. 

In choice and well-fed beef, the lean will be found intergrained 
with fat : very lean meat is generally of an inferior quality. 

The ribs, the sirloin, and the rumn, are the proper joints for 
roasting. The round, or buttock, the edgebone, the second roimd, or 
mouse-buttock, the shin, the brisket, the shoulder or leg of mutton 
piece, and the clod, may be boiled or stewed. The neck is senerally 
used for soup or gravy ; and the thin flank for collaring The best 
steaks are cut from the middle of the rump ; the next ^t from the 
veiny piece, or from the chuck-rib. The mside of the sirloin, com- 
monly used for the purpose in France, makes by far the most delicate 
steaks ; but though exceedingly tender, they are considered by some 
English epicures to be wanting in flavour. 

'Tht finest part of the sirloin is the chump-end, which contains the 
laiger portion of the fillet ; of the ribs, the middle ones are those 
generauy preferred by experienced housekeepers 



TO ROAST SIRLOIN; OR RIBS OF BEEF. 

Let the joint hang as lone as it can possibly be kept perfectly 
sweet. When it is first brought in, remove the pipe of marrow whicn 
runs along the backbone ; and cut out the kernels from the fat. Be 
Tery careful in summer to guard it from flies; examine it fire- 
quently in warm or damp weamer ; and scrape off with a knife, or 
wipe away with a dry cloth, any moisture which may appear on the 
sorfiice : when this has been done, dust some powdered ginger or 
pepper over it Unless the joint should be veir large, its appearance 
will be improved by taking off the ends of the bones, which may then 
be salted for a few days, and afterwards boiled. Spit the beef firmly ; 
place it near the fire to render the surface firm, as directed in the 
article Roasting^ of Chapter IX. ; then draw it to a distance and let 
it remain so until the heat has well penetrated the interior ; and, if 
from prejudice the old method be still preferred, heat it very m- 
dually in the first instance (in either case baste it constantly), and let 
It be drawn nearer to the fire for the last half hour or more of 
roasting, merely to brown it well. Persons who object to meat being 
frothed ioT table, have it drcdced with flour when it is first placed a. 
the fire, and sprinkled with nne salt when it is nearly done. It ia 
not necessary to paper the fat of bee^ as many cooks duect, if proper 
attention be given to it while roasting. 

As a general rule, it may be observed, that when the steam from 



186 MODEBN COOKEKT. [chap. x. 

the meat draws strongly towards the fire, it is nearly or quite ready 
to serve. The time required to roast it vrill depend on the state 
of the weather,* the size and strength of the Ere, the thickness 
of the joint, the use or non-use of a meat-screen or reflector, the 
general temperature of the kitchen, and other contingencies. A 
quarter of an hour for each pound of meat is commonly allowed for 
solid, heavy joints, and, if the directions we have given be attended 
to, this will not be found too much even for persons who prefer beef 
somewhat rere : it must be left longer at the fire if wished very 
thoroughly roasted, and quite double the usual time when the plan 
we have noticed at page 172, is adopted. When likely to be sent to 
table hashed, minced, or dressed a second time in any way, the juices 
of the meat should be dried up as little as possible when it is first 
cooked. 

ROAST RUMP OF BEEF. 

As this joint is genendl;^ too much to serve whole, as much of it 
as will form a handsome dSsh should be cut from the chump end to 
roast. It must be managed as the sirloin, to which it is commonly 
preferred by connoisseurs. When boned and rolled into the form of 
a fillet of veal, as it sometimes is, nearly or quite an additional hour 
dbould be allowed to dress it. 



TO ROAST PART OF A ROUIYD OF BEEF. 

The natural division of the meat will show where the silver side 
3f the round is to be separated from the upfjer or tongue side, which 
is the proper part for roasting, and which will be found equally good 
and profitable for the purpose, if allowed to hang as long as it can be 
kept sweet before it is dressed. Care should be taken in dividing the 
meat, not to pierce the inner skin. The silver side, with the udder, 
if there should be one to the joint, may be pickled, spiced, or simply 
salted, and will be excellent either way. The outside fat should be 
drawn tightly round the remainder of the beef, which must be 
firmly dkewered, or bound with tape, to keep it in form. It will 
require long roasting at a strong, st^y fire, and should be kept 
constantly basted. 

Beef, 14 lbs. : 4i^ to 5 hours. 

Obs.—We think that larding the beef quite through with large 
lardoons of firm fat, of udder, or of bacon, would be an improve- 
ment ; and we ought also to obsei-ve, that unless it be delicate and of 
fine quality, it wiU not answer well for roasting. 

* The meat will be much sooner done in hot weather than in cold. If frozen, 
it must be thawed very gradually before it is put to the fire, or no length of timo 
will roast it; this will be effected better by laying it into cold water for i 
faonrs bflfOK it is wanted, than by any other means. 



CHAP 3C.J BEEF. 187 



TO BOAST ▲ FILLET OF BBBF. 

Raise the fillet tcom the inside of the sirloin, or from part of it, 
^th a sharp knife ; leave the fat on, trim off the skin, lard it 
through, or all over, or roast it quite plain ; baste it with butter, and 
send It very hot to table, with tomata sauce, or iouce piquante, or 
eschalot sauce, in a tureen. It is sometimes served with brown 
gravy and currant jelly ; it should then be garnished with force- 
zneat-balls, made as for hare. If not very large, an hour and a 
quarter will roast it well with a brisk fire. 

Obs, — ^The remainder of the joint may be boned, rolled, and 
roasted, or braised; or made into meat cakes; or served as a 
miniature round of beefl 

1| hour. 

BOAST BEEF STEAK. 

If extremely tender, a hum slice from the middle of the rump will 
make an excellent small dish of roast meat, when a joint is not easily 
to be procured. Let it be smoothly cut, from an inch to an inch and 
a half thick, flattened on a table, and the inside sprinkled with a little 
fine salt and cayenne, or common pepper. Make a roll of forcemeat, 
as No. 1, Chapter YIII., adding, at j^easure, a flavouring of minced 
onion or eschalot, and increasing the (|uantity of spices ; place this 
on one end of the steak, and roll it up ^ghtly m it ; skewer and bind 
the meat so that the forcemeat cannot escape; fasten a buttered paper 
over it, and roast it an hour and a half, or more, according to its size. 
Twenty mmutes before it is served, take off the paper and flour the 
meat, which should be kept well basted with butter all the time it is 
roasting. Send brown gravy to table with it, and pour a little over 
the beef. 

1} hour, or more. 

TO BBOIL BEEF STEAKS. 

The steaks should be from half to three quarters of an inch thick, 
equally sliced, and freshly cut from the middle of a well kepl^ finely 
grained, and tender rump of beef. They should be neatly trimmed, 
and once or twice divided, if very lar^ The fire, as we have already 
said in the general directions for broiling (page 175^, must be strong 
and clear. The bars of the gridiron should be thin, and not very 
dose together. When they are thoroughly heated, without being 
foffidently burning to scorch the meat, wipe and rub them with fresh 
mutton suet ; next pepper the steaks sJightly, but never season them 
with salt before they are dressed; lay them on the gridiron, and 
when done on one side, turn them on the other, being carefiil to 
catch, in the dish in which they are to be sent to table, any gravy

vhicli may threaten to drain from them when they are moved. Let 
them he served the instant they are taken from the fire ; and have 
ready at the moment, dish, cover, and plates, as hot as they can he. 
From eight to ten minutes will be sufficient to broil steaks for the 
generality of eaters, and more than enough for those who like them 
but partially done. 

Genuine amateurs seldom take prepared sauce or gravy with their 
steaks, as they consider the natural juices of the meat sufficient. 
When any accompaniment to them is desired, a small . quantity of 
choice mushroom catsup may be warmed in the dish that is heated to 
receive them ; and which, when the not very refined flavour of a raw 
eschalot is liked, as it is by some eaters, may previously be rubbed 
with one, of which the huqge end has been cut off. A thin slice or 
two of fresh butter is sometimes laid under the steaks, where it soon 
melts and mingles with the gravy which flows from them. The 
appropriate tureen sauces for broiled beef steaks are onion, tomata, 
oyster, eschalot, hot hoiaeradish, and brown cucumber, or mush- 
room sauce. 

Obs, 1. — We have departed a little in this receipt from our pre- 
vious instructions for broiling, by recommending that the steaks 
should be turned but once, instead of ** often,** as all great autho- 
rities on the subject direct. By trying each method, our readers will 
be able to decide for themselves upon the preferable one : we can 
only say, that we have never eaten steaks so excellent as thoac wiiich 
have been dressed exac&y in accordance with the receipt we have iust 
given, and we have taken infinite pams to ascertain the really oest 
mode of preparing this very favourite English dish, which so con- 
stantly makes its appearance both carelessly cooked and ill served, 
especially at private tables. 

Ohs, 1. — It is a good plan to throw a few bits of charcoal on the 
fire some minutes before the steaks are laid down, as they give forth 
a strong heat without any smoke : a coke fire is also advantageous for 
broiling them. 

The upright gridirons, by which meat is rather toasted than 
broiled, though used in many kitchens, and generally pronounced ex- 
ceedingly convenient where they have been tried, do not appear to 
us so well adapted for dressing steaks as those of less modem fashion, 
which are placed over, instead of before the fire. 

BEEF STEAKS 1 LA FRANQAISE. 

The inside of the sirloin freed from skin and cut evenly into round

Season the steaks with fine salt and pepper, brush them with a little 
clarified butter, and broil them over a clear brisk fire. Mix a tea« 
spoonful of parsley minced extremely fine, with a large slice of fresh

rather thin, coloured of a fine hrown, and placed evenly round the 
meat.

Cut the beef into small thin steaks as above, season them with fine 
salt and pepper, dredge them lightly with flour, and fry them in 
butter over a brisk fire; arrange them in a chain round aTery hot 
dish, and pour into the centre the olive sauce of Chapter Y. 

STEWED BEEF STEAK (ENTRiE). 

This may be cut from one to two inches thick, and the time of 
stewing it must be proportioned to its size. Dissolve a slice of butter 
in a lurge saucepan or stewpan, and brown the steak on both sides, 
moving it often that it may not bum ; then shake in a little flour, 
and when it is coloured pour in by degrees rather more than suf- 
ficient broth or water to cover the meat. When it boils, season it with 
salt, take off the scum, slice in one onion, a carrot or two, and 
half a turnip ; add a small bunch of sweet herbs, and stew the steak 
▼ery softly from two hours and a half to three hours. A quarter of 
an hour before it is served, stir well into the gravy three teaspoonsful 
of rice flour smoothly mixed with a little cayenne, half a wine- 
glassful of mushroom catsup, and a slight seasoning of spice. A 
leaspoonfol of currie powder, in addition, idll improve both the 
flavour and the appearance of the sauce. The omon is sometimes 
browned with the meat ; and the quantity is considerably increased. 
Eschalots may be used instead, where tneir strong flavour is ap- 
proved. A few button-mushrooms, stewed from twenty to thirty 
minutes with the meat, wiU render the catsup unnecessary. Wine, 
or any favourite store sauce, can be added at will. 

2i to3 hours. 

FRIED BEEF STEAK. 

We have little to add here to the directions of Chanter IX., which 
are sufficient to enable the cook to send a dish of fried steaks to table 
properly dressed. Currie sauce, highly onioned^ is frequently served 
with them.

set it by until cold, when it will be equally good. The fat of the

minutes it will be ready to serve. A glass and a half of port, or of 
white wine, will greatly improve this stew, which may likewise be 
ibvoured with the store-sauce of page 146, or with another, which 
we find exoeUent for the purpose, made with half a pint of port 
wine, the same of mushroom-catsup, a quarter pint of walnut pickle, 
a tablespoonful of the best soy, and a dessertspoonful of cayenne- 
vin^nur, all well shaken together and poured into a bottle containing 
the thin rind of a lemon and two fine mellow anchovies, of moderate 
size. A few delicately fried forcemeat-balls may be slipped into it 
after it is dished. 

Obs.— The limits of our work will net permit us to devote a 
further space to this class of dishes, but an intelligent cook will find 
it easy to vary them in numberless ways. Mushrooms, celery, 
carrots, sweet herbs, parboiled new potatoes, green peas, rice, and 
cunie-powder may be advantageously used for that purpose. Ox- 
tails, just blanched and cut into joints, will be found excellent sub- 
stitutes for the beef: mutton and veal also may be dressed in the 
fftiff g yny. The meat and yegetables can be browned before broth

or water is poured to them; but though, perhaps, more sayoury, 
the stew will then be much less delicate. Each kind of vegetable 
should be allowed something more than sufficient time to render it 
perfectly tender, but not so much as would reduce it to pulp. 

TO STEW 8HIN OF BEEF. 

Wash, and set it on to stew in sufficient cold water to keep it just 
coyered until it is done. When it boils, take off the scum and put 
an ounce and a quarter of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to 
add a few cloves and some black pepper, slightly bruised and tied up 
loosely in a fold of muslin, two or more onions, a root of celery, a 
bunch of savoury herbs, four or five carrots, and as many turnips, 
either whole or sliced : if to be served with the meat, the two last 
will require a little more than the ordinary time of boiling, but 
otherwise they may be simmered with the meat from the b^inning. 
Give the beef from four to five hours* gentle stewing ; and serve k 
with part of its own liquor thickened and flavoured, or quite plain. 
An excellent dish for a family may be made by stewing the thick 
fleshy part of the shin or leg, in stock made of the knuckle, with a 
few bits of lean ham, or a slice of hung beef from which the smoked 
edges have been carefully pared away, and some spice, salt, and vege- 
tables : by frying these last before they are thrown into the soup- 
pot the savour of the stew will be greatly heightened ; and a tureen 
of good soup may be made of its remains, after it has been served at 
table. 

Ox-cheek, after having been soaked for four or five hours, and 
washed with great nicety, may be dressed like the shin ; but as it haa 
little flavour, the gravy should be struned, and quite cleared from 
fat, then put into a clean saucepan, and thickened as soon as it boils, 
with Uie following mixture : — three dessertspoonsful of rice-flour, 
nearly a wineglassml of catsup, a teaspoonsful of currie-powder, or 
a little powdered ginger and cayenne. When these have stewed for 
ten minutes, dish the head, pour the sauce over, and serve it. 
Shin of beef, 4 to 5 hours. Ox-cheek, 2 to 3 hours.

{A common Receipt) 

Take seven or eight pounds of a rump of beef (or of any ether 
tender joint), free from bone, and skewer it firmly into a good shape. 
Put two ounces of butter into a thick saucepan or stewpan, and when 
it boils stir to it a tablespoonfal of flour ; keep these well shaken 
over a gentle fire until they are of a fine amber colour ; then lay in

of hot water or gravy ; add a bunch of savonry herbs, one laige or 
two small carrots cut in thick ^ces, two or three moderate-sized 
onions, two bay-leaves, and saffident pepper and salt to season the 
grav^. Let the meat simmer gently from four to five hours, and 
turn it when it is half done. When ready to serve, lift the beef into 
a hot dish, lay the vegetables round, and pour the gravy over it, 
after havinff taken out the herbs and skimmed away the fat. In 
France, half or the whole of a calfs foot is stewed with the beef^ 
which is there generally larded widi thick lardoons of fat bacon. 
(For larding, see Chapter X.) Veal dressed in this way is even 
better than beef. The stewpan used for either should be as nearly 
of the size of the meat as possible. 
Beef, 7 to 8 lbs.: 4 to 5 hours. 



BTEWBD SIRLOIN OF BEEF. 

As a matter of convenience we have occasionally had this joiat 
stewed instead of roasted, and have found it excellent. Cut out the 
inade or fillet as entire as noesible, and reserve it for a sei>arate dish ; 
then remove the bones witn care, or let the butcher do this. Spread 
the meat flat on a table and cover the inside with thin slices of striped 
bacon, after having first strewed over it a mixed seasoning of a small 
teaspoonful of salt, half as much mace or nutmeg, and a moderate 
quantity of pepper or cavenne. Roll and bind the meat up firmlv, 
lay it into a stewpan or thick iron saucepan nearly of its size, and aad 
the bones and as much good beef broth as will nearly cover the 
joint. Should this not be at hand, put a few slices of lean ham or 
bacon under the beef, and lay round it three pounds of neck or 
knuckle of veal, or of stewing beef divided into several parts ; then 
pour to it cold water instead of broth. In either case, so soon as it 
Las boiled a few minutes and been well cleaned from scum, throw in 
a large faggot of savoury herbs, three or four carrots, as many leeks, 
or a large onion stuck with a dozen cloves; and an hour later two 
blades of mace, and half a teaspoonful of peppercorns. Stew the 
beef very gently indeed from four to five hours, and longer, should 
the joint be large : serve it with a good JSspagnole sauce piquante, or 
brown caper sauce. Add what salt may be needed before the vege- 
tables are thrown in ; and, after the meat is lifted out, boil down to 
soup or gn,YY the hqaor in which it has been stewed. To many 
tastes it would be an improvement to flour and brown the outside of 
the beef in butter before the broth or water is poured to it : it may 
also be stewed (but somewhat lonser) half-covered with rich gravy, 
and turned when partially done. Minced eschalots may be strewed 
'>ver the inside before it is rolled, when their strong savour is re- 
lished, or veal forcemeat may supply their place.

HbSs joint is more eamlT cured, and is of better wpeannce when 
ihe bones are remoyed before it is dressed. Boll and bind it fiimlj 
-with a fillet of tape, cover it with stroxiff cold beef broth or gravy, 
and stew it very gently indeed from six nonrs to between seven aoi 
eight; add to it, after the scum has been well cleared off, one lazge 
or two moderate-sized onions stuck with thirty doves, a head of 
celery, two carrots, two turnips, and a large fiiggot of savoury herbs. 
When the beef is perfectly tender quite through, which may be 
known by probing it with a sharp thin skewer, remove the fillets of 
tape, dish it neatly, and serve it with a rich EipagnSU^ and a gar- 
nish of forced tomatas, or with a highly-flavoured brown English 
gravy, and stewed carrots in the dish : for these last the mild pre« 
paration of garlic or eschalots, of page 122, may be substituted with 
good effect. They should be well dnined, laid roimd the meat» and 
a little brown gravy should be poured over the whole. 

This is the most sunple and economical manner of slewing the 
beef; but shonkL a richer one be desired, half roast the joint, and 
stew it aitervrards in strong gni^y to which a pint of mushrooms, and 
a pint of sheny or Madem, should be added an hour before it Is 
ready for table. Keep it hot while a portion of the gravy is diiek-

Obs.—A French cook of some celebrity, orders the palates to be 
laid on the gridiron until the skin can be easily peeled or scraped off; 
the plan seems a good one, but we have not tned it.

little, sprinkle over it a small quantity of salt and cayenne, dip it into 
clarified butter and then into some fine bread-crumbs, with which 
it should be thickly covered, lay it on the gridiron, and when 
equally browned all over serve it immediately. If more convenient 
the ox-tail may be set into the oven or before the fire, until properly 
coloured : it may likewise be sent to table without broiling, dished 
upon stewed cabbage or in its own gravy thickened, and with tomats 
sauce, in a tureen. 

TO SALT AND PICKLE BEEF, IN YARIOUS WAYS. 

Let the meat hang a couple of days in mild weather, and four or 
five in winter, before it is salted or pickled. During the heat of 
summer it is better to inmierse it entirely in brine, that it may be 
secured alike from the flies, and from the danger of becoming putrid. 
Trim it, and take out the kernels from the fat ; then rub a httle fine 
dry salt over it, and leave it until the following day ; drain it well 
from the blood, which will be found to have flowed from it, and it 
ynll be ready for anj of the following modes of curing, which are all 
excellent of their kind, and have been well proved. 

In very cold weather, the salt may be applied quite warm to the 
meat : it should always be perfectly dry, and reduced to powder. 

Saltpetre hardens and renders the meat indigestible ; sugar, on the 
contrary, mellows and improves it much ; and it is more tender when 
cured with bay salt than when common salt is used for it. 

TO SALT AND BOIL A ROUND OF BEEF. 

Mix an ounce of salti)etre, finely powdered, with half a pound of 
very coarse sugar, and rub the beef thoroughly with them ; in two 
days add three quarters of a pound of common salt, well dried and 
beaten ; turn and rub the meat well in every part with the pickle 
for three weeks, when it will be fit to dress. Just wash off the salt, 
and skewer the beef as round and as even as possible ; bind it tightly 
with broad tape, cover it with cold water, place it over a rather 
brisk fire, and after it boils draw it to the side of the stove and let it 
simmer gently for at least five hours. Carrots, mashed turnips, or 
cabbages, are usually served with boiled beef; and horse-radish 
stewed for ten minutes in equal parts of vinegar and water, then 
pressed well from them, and mixed with some rich melted butter, is 
a good sauce for it. 

IBeef, 20 lbs. ; coarse sugar, i lb. ; saltpetre, 1 oz. : 2 days. Salt, 
] lb. : 21 days. Boil 5 hours, or more. 

Obs, — Beef cured by this receipt if properly boiled, is tender, of 
good colour and flavour, and not over salt. The rump, edge-bone, 
and brisket may be salted, or pickled in the same way as the 
xound 



CHAP. X.] BEEP. 197 



HAMBURGH PICKLE FOB BEEF, HAMS, AND TONGUE. 

Boil together, for twenty minutes, two gallons of water, three 
pounds of bay salt, two pounds of coarse sugar, two ounces of salt- 
petre, and two of black pepper, bruised, and tied in a fold of muslin ; 
dear off the scum thoroughly, as it rises, pour the pickle into a deep 
earthen pan, and when it is quite cold lay in the meat, of which 
every part must be perfectly covered with it. A moderate-sized 
round of beef will be ready for table in a fortnight ; it should be 
turned occasionally in the brine. Five pounds of common salt may 
be substituted for the quantity of bay salt given above ; but the 
meat will not be so finely flavoured. 

Water, 2 gallons ; bay-salt, 3 lbs. ; saltpetre, 2 oz. ; black pepper, 
2 oz. ; sugar, 2 lbs. : 20 minutes. 

ANOTHER PICKLE FOR TONGUES, BEEF, AND HAMS. 

To three gallons of spring water add six pounds of common salt, 
two pounds of bay-salt, two pounds of common loaf sugar, and two 
ounces of saltpetre. Boil these over a gentle Are, and be careful to 
take off all the scum as it rises : when quite cold it will be fit for 
use. Bub the meat to be cured, with fine salt, and let it drain for a 
day in order to free it from the blood ; then immerse it in the brine, 
talung care that every part of it shall be covered. Young pork 
should not remain more than from three to five days in the pickle ^ 
but hams for drying may be left in it for a fortnight at least: 
tongues will be ready in rather less time. Beef may remain from 
one week to two, according to its size, and the degree of saltness 
deared for it. A little experience will soon teach the exact time 
required for the different kinds of meat. When the pickle has been 
in use for about three months, boil it up again gently, and take the 
scum carefully off. Add to it three pounds of common salt, four 
ounces of sugar, and one of saltpetre : it will remain good for many 
months. 

Water, 3 gallons ; common salt, 6 lbs. ; bay salt, 2 lbs. ; loaf sugar, 
2 lbs. ; saltpetre, 2 oz. : boil 20 to 30 minutes. 

DUTCH, OR HUNG BEEF. 

For fourteen ^unds weight of the round, the rump, or the thick 
flank of beef^ mix two ounces of saltpetre with the same quantity of 
coarse sugar; rub the meat with tnem in every part, and let it 
remain for two days, then add one pound of bay salt, four ounces of 
common salt, and one ounce of groimd black pepper. Rub these 
ingredients thoroughly into the beef, and in four days pour over it a 
pound of treacle ; rub and turn it daily for a fortnight ; drain, and 
send it to be smoked. When wanted for table, put it into plenty of 



198 MODEBK OOOKEBT. [cBAP. X. 

boiling water, boil it slowly, and press it under a hcayy weight while 
hot. A slice of this beef, from which the edges have been caiefnlly 
trimmed, will serve to flavour soups or gravies as well as ham.

into the meat at first, and the treacle may be altogether omitted; 
cloves and mace, too, may be added in the same proportion as for 
^kedbee£ 

GOZiLAIIBD BEEF. 

Only the thinnest part of the flank, or the ribs, which are not so 
generally used for it, will serve conveniently for ooUaring. The first 
of these should be hun^^ in a damp place for a day or two, to soften 
the outer skin ; then ruobed with coarse sugar, and left for a couple 
of days ; when, for eight pounds of the meat, one ounce of saltpetre 
and lialf a pound of ^dt should be added. In ten days it will be fit 
to dress. The bones and tough inner skin must be removed, and 
the beef sprinkled thicklv on the under side with parsley and other 
savoury herbs shred smaU, before it is rolled, which should be done 
very tightly : it must then be secured with a cloth, and bound as 
closely as possible with broad tape. It will require nearly or quite 
five hours of gentle boiling, and should be placed while hot under a 
weight, or in a press, without having the tape and doth removed.

Mix half an ounce of saltpetre with the same quantity of pepper,

seven ounces of treacle ; turn the beef daily in the pickle for a week 
or more ; dip it into water, bone it and skin the inside, roll and bind 
it up very tightlv, lay it into cold water, and boil it for three hours 
and a half. We have found beef dressed by this receipt extremely 
good: herbs can, of course, be added to it as usual. Spices and 
juniper beries would to many tastes improve it, but we give the 
receipt simply as we have been accustomed to have it used.

five to six hours in a moderate oven, which should not, however, be 
flofficiently fierce to harden the outside of the joint, whidi, H pro- 
perly managed will be exceedingly tender. Let it cool in the pan ; 
and dear off the suet before it is dished. It is to be served cold, and

cored by it has received such hi^h commendation m>m several of our 
fiienda who have nartaken of it frequently, that we think we may 
safely insert it witnout. The proportion of allspice appears, to us 
more than would be agreeable to many tastes, and we would rather 
xecommend that part of it should be omitted, and that a portion of 
nutm^, mace, and cloves, should be substituted for it ; as we have 
fbond these spices to answer well in the following receipt. 

SPICED BEEF* 

{Oood and wholesome.') 

For twelve pounds of the round, rump, or thick flank of bee^ 
take a large teaspoonful of freshly-pounded mace, and of ground 
Uack pepper, twice as much of cloves, one small nutmeg, and a

into a stewpan or saucepan nearly of its size, pour to it a pint and a 
half of good beef broth, and when it begins to boil, take off the scum, 
and throw in one small onion, a moderate-sized faggot of thyme and 
parsley, and two large, or four small carrots. £et it simmer quite 
sollly for four hours and a half, and if not wanted to serve hot» 
leave it in its own liquor until it is nearly cold. This is an excellent 
and far more wholesome dish than the hard, bright-coloured beef 
which is cured with large quantities of salt and saltnetre : two or 
three ounces of juniper-berries may be added to it witn the spice, to 
heighten its flavour. 

Beef, 12 lbs. ; sugar, 7 oz. ; mace and black pepper, each, 1 large

broth for bouillon), 1^ pint ; onion, 1 small ; bunch of herbs ; car- 
rots, 2 larse, or 4 small : stewed ^ hours. 

Obs, — We give this receipt exactly as we have often had it used, 
but celery and turnips might be added to the gravy; and when the 
apeparance of the meat is much considered, three-quarters of an 
ounce of saltpetre may be mixed with the spices ; the beef may also 
be plainly boiled in water only, with a few vegetables, or baked in a 
deep pan with a little gravy. No meat must ever be left to cool in 
the stewpan or saucepan in which it is cooked ; it must be lifted into 
a pan of its own deptn, and the liquor poured upon it. 

▲ MINIATURB ROUND OF BEEF. 

" Select a fine rib of beef, and have it cut small or large in width, 
according to your taste ; it may thus be made to weigh irom five to 
twelve pounds, or more. Take out the bone, and wrap the meat 
round like a fillet of veal, securing it with two or three wooden 
skewers ; place it in a strong pickle for four or five days, and then 
cook it, taking care that it does not boil, but only simmers, from 
forty minutes, or more» according to its size. It is best to put it on 
in hot water, as it vnll not draw the gravy so much as cold. Man^ 
persons adjust a rib of beef in this way K>r roasting : let them try it 
salted, ana they need not envy the possessor of the finest round of 
beef." We give the receipt to our readers in its original form, and 
we can assure them, from our own experience, that it is a good one ; 
but we would recommend that, in dressing the meat, quite the usual 
time for each pound of it should be allowed. When boned and 
rolled at the butcher*s, the skewers should be removed when it is 
first brought in ; it should be well wiped with a dry cloth, or washed 
with a little fresh brine, and a small quantity of salt and saltpetre 
should be rubbed over the inside, it may then be firmlv bound 
with tape, and will be quite ready to boll when taken from the 
pickle. The sirloin, after the inside fillet is removed, may be cured 



<2EAP. z.] BEEF. 201 

and dressed in the same way, and will be found super-excellent it 
the beef be well &tted and properly kept. The Hamburgh pickle 
(see page 197) is perhaps the best for these ioints. Part of the 
romp, taken clear of bone, answers admirably when prepared by this . 
receipt. 

BEEF ROLL^ OB CANELLON DE BCEITF. (£NTr£e.) 

Chop and mix thoroughly two pounds of lean and very tender 
beef with one pound of slightly striped bacon; season them with a 
large teaspoonM of pepper, a little salt, a small nutmeg, or two- 
thirds as much mace, the grated rind of a lemon, or a teaspoonful of 
thyme and parsley finely minced. Form the whole into a thidc 
rouleau, wrap a buttered paper round it, enclose it in a paste made 
of flour and water, and send it to a moderate oven for a couple of 
hours. Bemove the paper and the crust, and serve the meat with a 
little brown grany. Lamb and veal are excellent dressed in this 
way, particularly when mixed with plenty of mushrooms. Brown 
cneumber sauce should be served with the lamb; and currie, or 
oyster sauee, when there are no mushrooms, with the veal. A 
flavouring of onion or of eschalot, where it is liked, can be added at

MINCED COLLOPS AT7 NATTJRBL. 

IGnce finely a pound of very tender rump steak, free from iat or 
ddn; season it with a moderate quantity of pepper and salt, set it 
over a gentle fire, and keep it stirred with a fork until it is quite hot 
tiiat it may not gather mto lumps. Simmer it very slowly in its 
own gravy from ten to twelve minutes, and then, should it be too 
diT, add a little boiling water, broth, or gravy; stew it for two 
minutes longer, and serve it directly. 

These collops are particularly suited to persons in delicate health, 
or of weak digestion ; and when an extra dish is required at a short 
notice, from the expedition with which they may be dressed, they are 
a convenient resource. 

10 to 12 minutes. 

SAVOURY MINCED COLLOPS. 

Make a little thickenmg (see Brown Roux^ Chapter Y.) with about 
an ounce and a half of butter, and a dessertspoonful of flour ; when 
h b^ns to be coloured, shake lightly into it a large teaspoonful of 
&iely-shred parsley or mixed savoury herbs, two-thirds as much Df 
salt, and half the quantity of pepper. Keep these stirred over a

Before they are served, stir to them a little catsup, chili Yinegsr^

BEEP TONGUES. 

These may be cured by any of the receipts which we have already 
ffiven for picklirs; beef, or for those which will be found further on 
for hams and bacon. Some persons prefer them cured with salt and 
saltoetre only, and dried naturally in a cool and airy room. For 
such of our readers as like them highly and richly flavoured we give 
our own method of having them prepared, which is this : — '^ Kub 
over the tongue a handful of fine salt, and let it drain until the fol- 
lowing day ; then, should it weigh from seven to eight pounds, mix 
thoroughly an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of the coarsest sugar, 
and hsdf an ounce of black pepper ; when the ton^e has been weU 
rubbed with these, add three ounces of bruised jumper-berries ; and 
when it has laid two days, eight ounces of bay salt, dried and 
pounded ; at the end of three days more, pour on it half a pound of 
treacle, and let it remain in the pickle a fortnight after tms ; then 
hang it to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send it to be smoked 
over a wood fire for two or three weeks. Should the peculiar fiavour

of the jnniper-berrief prerail too miich, or be diBapproved, they im^ 
be in part, or altogether, omitted ; aad ax ounces of sogar may be 
Tabbed into the tongue in the fint innfanee when it is iSked better 
than treacle.

TO DBE88 BEEF TONGUES. 

When taken fresh from the pickle they require no soaking, unless 
ihey should have remained in it much beyond the usual time, or have 
been cured with a more than common proportion of salt ; but when 
they haye been smoked and highly dried, they should be laid for two> 
or three hoars into cold, and as much Icmger into tepid water, before 
they are dressed: if extremely dry, ten or twelve hours must be 
allowed to soften them, and they should always be brought very 
slowly to boil. Two at three carrots and a laige bunch of savoury 
herbs, added after the scum is cleared off, will improve them. They 
should be simmered until they are extremely tender, when the skin 
will peel from them easily. A highly dried tongue of moderate size 
will usuaUy require irom three and a half to four hours* boiling ; an 
onsmoked one about an hour less ; and for one which has not been 
salted at all a shorter time will suffice. 

BORDYKE BECEIPT FOB STEWING ▲ TONGUE. 

After the tongue has been soaked, trimmed, and washed with 
extreme nicety, lay it into a vessel of fitting size, and place round it 
three or four pounds of the nieck, or of any other lean cuttings of 
bee( with some bones of undressed veal, and jwur in sufficient cold 
water to keep it covered until it is done; or, instead of this, use 
strong unseasoned beef broth made with the shin, and any odd bits or 
bones of veal which may be at hand. Let the tongue be brought to 
boil very gradually, that it may be plump and tender. Remove the 
scum when it first rises, and when it is quite cleared off add a large 



204 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. z. 

faggot of parsley, thyme, and winter sayonry, three ttrrots, a smaH 
onion, and one mild turnip. After three hours and a half of gentle 
simmering, probe the tongue, and if sufficiently done peel off the 
skin and serve it quickly. If not wanted hot for table, lay it upon, 
a very clean board or trencher, and fasten it down to it by passing a 
carving fork through the root, and a smaller one through the tip^ 
drawing the tongue straight with the latter before it is £ced in the 
board; let it remain thus untU it is quite cold. It is much the 
fashion at present to glaze hams and tongues, but this should never 
be attempted by a cook not well acquainted with the manner of doing 
it, and tne proper flavour and appearance of the glaze. For direc- 
tions to make it, see pase 104. Wnere expense is not regarded, three 
or four pounds of veal may be added to the beef in this receipt, or 
the tongue may be stewed in a prepared gravy made with equal parts 
of beef and veal, and vegetables as above, but without salt : this may 
afterwards be converted into excellent soup. A fresh or an on- 
smoked tongue may be dressed in this way, but will require less 
time : for the former, salt must be added to the gravy. 

TO ROABT ▲ BEEF HEART. 

Wash and soak the heart very thoroughly, cut away the lobes;, 
fill the cavities with a veal forcemeat (No. 1, Chapter VIII.), secure 
it well with a needle and twine, or very coarse thread, and roast 
it at a good fire for an hour and a half, keeping it basted plenti- 
fully with butter. Pour melted butter over it, after it is dished, and 
send it to table as hot as possible. Many persons boil the heart for 
three quarters of an hour before it is put to the fire, and this is said 
to render it more delicate eating ; the time of roasting must of course 
be proportionately diminished. Good brown gravy may be sub- 
stituted for the melted butter, and currant jelly also may be served 
with it. 

1^ hour, or more. 

BEEF KIDNEY. 

Slice the kidney rather thin, after having stripped off the skin and 
removed the fat ; season it with pepper, salt, and grated nutm^, and 
sprinkle over it plenty of minced parsley, or e<}ual parts of ^larsley 
and eschalots chopped very small. Fiy the shces over a brisk fire, 
and when nicely browned on both sides, stir amongst them a tea- 
spoonful of flour, and pour in by degrees a ciip of gravy and a glass 
of white wine; bring the sauce to the point of boiling, add a morsel 
of fresh butter and a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and pour the 
whole into a hot dish garnished with fried bread. Ttaa is a French 
receipt, and a very excellent one.

when ihej are done through lift them out, empty the pan, and make 
grayy for them with a raiall slice of hutter, a dessertspoonful of 
flour, pepper and salt, and a cup of hoiling water; shake these 
round and give them a minute^s simmering : fuld a little mushroom 
catsup, lemon juice, eschalot vinegar, or any store sauce that will give 
a ^ood flavour. Minced herhs are to man^ tastes an improvement to 
this dish, to which a small quantity of omon shred fine can he added 
when it is liked. 

6 to 9 minutes. 

▲N EXCELLENT HASH OF COLD BEEF. 

Put a slice of hutter into a thick saucepan, and when it hoils throw 
in a dessertspoonful of minced herhs, and an onion (or two or three 
eschalots) snred small: shake them over the fire until they are 
lightly hrowned, then stir in a tahlespoonful of flour, a little cayenne, 
0ome mace or nutmeg, and half a teaspoonful of salt. When the 
whole is well coloured, jwur to it three-quarters of a pint or more of 
hzx>th or gnivy, according to the (quantity of meat to De served in it. 
Let this hoil gently for fifteen nunutes; then strain it, add half a 
win^i^lasBful of mushroom or of compound catsup, lay in the meat, 
and keep it h;^ the side of the fire untu it is heated through and is on 
the point of simmering, hut be sure not to let it boil. Serve it up in 
a very hot dish, and garnish it with fried or toasted sippets of bread. 

A COMMON HASH OF COLD BEEF OR MUTTON. 

Take the meat from the hones, slice it small, trim off the brown 
edges, and stew down the trimmings with the bones well broken, an 
onion, a bunch of thyme and parsley, a carrot cut into thick slices, a 
few peppercorns, four cloves, some salt, and a pint and a half of 
water. When this is reduced to little more than three quarters of a 
pint, strain it, dear it from the fat, thicken it with a large dessert- 
spoonful of rice flour, or rather less of arrow-root, add salt and 
pepper if needed, boil the whole for a few minutes, then lav in the 
meat and heat it well. Boiled potatoes are sometimes sliced hot into 
a very common hash. 

Obs. — The cook should be reminded that if the meat in a hash or 
mince be allowed to boil, it will immediately become hard, and can 
then only be rendered eatable by very long stewing^ which is by no 
I dwable for meat which is already sufficiently cooked

potatoes, and send the dj^ to a moderate oven Ibr half an hour. A 
very superior kind of saunders is made by substitating fresh meat for 
roasted ; but this requires to be baked an hour or something more. 
Sausage-meat highly seasoned may be served in this way, instead of 
beef or mutton.

and water, over the ends where the marrow is visible, and tie a cloth 
tightly over them; take the paste off before the bones are sent 
to table, and serve them, placed upright in a napkin, with slices of 
dry toasted bread apart. When not wanted for immediate use, they 
may be partially boiled, and set into a cool place, where they will 
lemain good for many days. 

Laige marrow bones, 2 hours; moderate sized, Ij- hour. To 
keep : boil them 1^ hour, and from i to f hour more when wanted 
fiir table.

BAKED MARROW BONES. 

When the bones have been sawed to the length of a deep pie-dish, 
wash and wipe them dir, lay them into it, and cover them entirely 
with a good batter. Send them to a moderate oven for an hour 
or more, and serve them in the batter. 

CLARIFIED MARROW FOR KEEPING. 

Take the marrow from the bones while it is as fresh as possible ; cat 
it small, put it into a very clean jar, and melt it with a gentle heat, 
either in a pan of water placed over the fire, or at the month of a 
cool oven ; strain it through a muslin, let it settle for a minute or 
two, and pour it, clear of sediment, into small jars. Tie skins, or 
double folds of thick paper, over them as soon as the marrow is 
cold, and store it in a cool place. It vrill remain good for months. 

OX-CHEEK STUFFED AND BAKED. 
(Chody and not expensive.) 

Geanse, with the greatest nicety, a fresh ox-cheek by washing, 
scraping it lightly with a knife, and soaking out the blood ; then put 
it into ]jlenty of warm water, and boil it gentlv for about an hour. 
Throw in a large teaspoonful of salt, and carenilly remove all the 
scum as it rises to the surface. Let it cool after it is lifted out, and 
then take away the bones, remembering always to work the knife 
close to them, and to avoid piercing the skin. When the cheek has 
become cold, put into it a good roll of forcemeat, made by the receipt 
Kos. 1, 2, or 3, of Chapter IX., or substitute the oyster or mushroom 
forcemeat which follows ; but in any case increase the quantity one- 
half at least : then skewer or bind up the cheek secui*ely, and send it 
to a moderate oven for an hour or an hour and a half. It should bo 
baked until it is exceedindy tender quite through. Drain it well 
from fat, dish it, withdraw the skewers, or unbind it gently, and either 
sauce it with a little good brown gravy, or send it to table with melted 
butter in a tureen, a cut lemon, and cayenne, or with any sauce of 
Chapter Y., which may be considered more appropriate.

TO CHOOSE TEAL. 

VjiAi* should be fat, finely grained, white, firm, and not overffrbwn : 
for when very large it is apt to be coarse and tough. It is more 
difficult to keep than any other meat except pork, and should never 
be allowed to acquire the slightest tsdnt before it is dressed, as any 
approach to putridity renders it equally unwholesome and offensive 
to the taste. The fillet, the loin, the shoulder, and the best end of 
the neck, are the parts generally selected for roasting ; the breast and 
knuckle are more usually stewed or boiled, although the former 
IS excellent roasted. The udder or firm white fat of the fillet, 
is much used by French cooks instead of butter, in the composition 
of their forcemeats : for these, it is first well boiled, then left until 
quite cold, and afterwards thoroughly pounded before it is mixed 
with the other ingredients. The head and feet of the call' are 



210 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. XI. 

valuable articles of food, both for tbe nutriment which the gelatinous 
parts of them afford, and for the gr^t variety of modes in which 
they may be dressed. The kidneys, with the rich fat that surrounds 
them, and the sweetbreads, are well known delicacies ; the liver and 
the heart also are very good eating; and no meat is so generally 
useful for rich soups and gravies as veal. 

TO TAKE THE HAIR FROM A CALF's HEAD WITH THE 
SKIN ON. 

It is better to do this before the head is divided; but if only the 
half of one with the skin on can be procured, it must be managed in 
the same way. Put it into plenty of water which is on the point of 
simmering but which does not positively boil, and let it remain in 
until it does so, and for five or six minutes afterwards, but at the 
first i^ll bubble draw it from the fire and let it merely scald ; then 
lift it out, and with a knife that is not sharp scrape on the hair as 
closely as possible. The butchers have an instrument on purpose 
for the operation; but we have had the head look quite as well 
when done in the manner we have just described, as when it has 
been sent in ready prepared by them. After the hair is off, the 
head should be well washed, and if it cannot be cooked the same day, 
it must be wiped extremely dry before it is hung up ; and when it 
has not been divided, it should be left whole until the time ap- 
proaches for dressing it. The brain must then be taken out, and 
both that and the head well soaked and washed with the greatest 
nicety. When the half head only is scalded, the brain shoiud first 
be removed. Calves* feet are freed from the hair easily in the same 
manner; indeed, we find it a better mode of having it cleared firom 
them than the one we have given in Chapter XXTl., though that is 
practised by many good butchers. 

BOILED calf's BEAD* 

When the head is dressed with the skin on, whkh many persons 
prefer, the ear must be cut off quite dose to it; it will require three 
quarters of an hour or upwards of additional boiling, and should be 
served covered with fined cmmbs : the more usual mode, howevert 
is to boil it without the skin. In either case first remove the brain, 
wash the head delicatelv clean, and soak it for a quarter of an honr^ 
cover it plentifully with cold water, remove the scum as it rises with 
great care, throw in a little salt, and boil the head gently until it is 
perfectly tender. In the mean time, wash and soak the brains first in 
cold and then in warm water, remove the skin or film, boil them in 
a small saucepan from fourteen to sixteen minutes, acocnrdinff to their 
sage, and when they are done, chop and mix them with eight or ten 
size leaves boiled tender and finely minced; or, if prefened, with 



CKAP.ZX.] TEAL. 211 

boiled parsl^ instead ; mnn them in a spoonful or two of melted 
butter, or white sauce ; skin the tongue, trim off the root, and serve 
it in a small dish with the brains round it. Send the head to table 
Teiy hot with parsley and batter poured oyer it, and some more in a 
tureen. A cheek of bacon, or very delicate pickled pork, is the usual 
accompaniment to boiled calTs head. 

We haye giyen here ihe common English mode of serving this 
di^ b^ some persons considered the best, and by others, as ezo^- 
iogly msipid. On the continent, tomata sauce takes place of the 
pnsley and butter; and rich oyster or Dutch sauce, are varieties 
often substituted for it in this country. 

With the skin on, from 2^ to 2f hou^; without the skin, from 1|

entirely ; replace the brain, lay the head into a stewpan, and simmer 
it gently for an hour in rich gravy. From five-and-twenty to thirty 
minutes before it is dished, add half a pint of mushroom-buttons. 
Thicken the gravy, if needful, with rice flour or with flour and 
butter, and serve plenty of forcemeat-balls roimd the head. For 
dishes of this kind, a little sweet-basil wine, or a few spriffs of the 
herb itself impart a very agreeable flavour. When neither these 
nor mushrooms are within reach, the very thin rind of a small but 
freah leiDoa may be boiled in the gravy, and the strained juice added 
at the instant of serving. 

Boiled from 1 to 2 hours ; stewed 1 hour.

Take sway the brains and tongue from the half of a cdfs head, 
and then remove the bones, bei^ careftil in doin^ so to keep the 
knife m close to them as possible, and to avoid piercing the outer 
akin : in this consists the whole art of boning, in which an attentive 
cook may eioily render herself expert. Next wash the head and dry 
it in a clean cloth ; sprinkle over the inside a little pounded mace, 
and cayenne or white pep^r ; roll it up tightly, and bind it round 
with tape or twine. Lay into a small stewpot three or four pounds 
of neck of veal or of beci^ twice or thrice divided, and place the 



212 MODERN COOKERT. [chap. XI. 

Head npou it with the bones well broken; pcur in half a grallon 
of cold water, or as much as will suffice to keep the head covered 
until it is done, and simmer it very gently from an hour and a 
quarter to an hour and three quarters. When it is extremely 
tender, lift it out, and if wantea for table, remote the binding, 
and serve it very hot, with currie sauce, rich oyster sauce, or ^i; 
sauce and brown gravy ; but should the remains, or the whole ofit 
be required for the following receipts, jwur no gravy over it : 
in the latter case do not take off the tape for several hours. Tlie 
tongue may be stewed with the head, but will require rather leas 
time. We do not think it needful to repeat in every receipt our 
directions for adding salt to, and removing carefully the scum from, 
meat that is stewed or boiled, but the cook must not neglect either. 
When the trouble of boning is objected to, it can be dispensed with 
for some of the dishes which follow, but not for all. After the head 
is taken out, boil the gravy until it is well reduced, and rich : it 
should be strongly jellied wnen cold. A bone of ham, or a slice of 
hung beef will much improve its flavour ; but vegetables must be 
avoided if it be wanted to Keep : a little spice and a faggot of parsley 
may be added to it, and a calf's foot will be sure to give it the 
requisite degree of firmness. This receipt is for a head without the 
skin. 

BUBLINOTON WHIMSET. 

Set aside until quite cold half a calf's head dressed by the pre- 
cecdng receipt. If, on cutting it, the gelatinous part should not 
appear perfectly tender, pare it off closely from the head, weig^h* 
and mince it ; put it into a pint of good gravy, and stew it gently 
from ten to nfteen minutes. Mince as much more of the head 
as win make up a poxmd in weight after the edges are trimmed ofT, 
and part of the fat is taken away ; add to this three ounces of the 
lean of a boiled ham finely chopped, the grated rind of a laTyi^e 
lemon, three teaspoonsful of parsley and one of thyme shred rery 
small, three quarters of a teaspoonful of mace, half a small nutmeg 
grated, a teaspoonful of salt, and a half-quarter one of cayenne; stir 
the whole well together, and put it, with half a pint more of gravy, 
to the portion which has been already simmered. When the 
whimsey has boiled sofUi/ from four to five minutes, pour it into 
moulds or pans, in which slices of the tongue have been evenly 
arranged, and when quite cold it will turn out very firmly. It may 
be garnished, before it is sent to table, with branches of parsley, 
which should, however, be perfectly dry; and when served for 
supper or luncheon, it may be accompanied by a salad dressing. 

Calf's head, 1 lb.; lean of ham, 3 oz. ; gravy, 1^ pint; xind of 
1 large lemon; parsley, 3 teaspoonsful; thyme and salt, each 1 
teaspoonful; mace, f teaspoonful; i nutmeg; cayenne, i part of

Obs. — ^The remaiiui of a plain boiled head may be made to serve 
for this dish, provided the gravy used with it be well jellied and of 
high flavour. Slices from the small end of a boiled uid smoked 
oz-tongne, from their bright colour improve greatly its appearance. 
It should be tasted before it is poured out, that sidt or any other 
seasoning may be added if needful. After three or four days* 
keeping, should any mould ap^ar upon the surface, take it off, 
re-melt the whimsey, and give it two minutes* boil. For change, 
the herbs may be omitted, and the quantity of ham increased, or 
some minced tongue substituted for it 

CUTLETS OF CALF'S HEAD. 

Prepare, by the Cook's Receipt, half a calfs head with or without 
the skm on ; only, in the latter case, allow more .time for the boiling. 
When it is quite cold, remove the fillets of tape, and cut the head into 
slices of half an inch thick, brush them with yolk of egg, and dip 
them into fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with the grated rind of half a 
lemon, half a teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs, some cayenne, and 
a little of the lean of a boiled ham chopped very small, should this 
last be at hand. Fiy the cutlets in butter of a fine light brown, 
make some gravy in the pan as for veal cutlets, and add to it the 
juice of half a lemon ; or mix a large teaspoonful of currie- powder, 
and one of flour, very smoothly with the butter, shake them over the 
fire for four or five minutes, and let the gravy simmer as much 
longer, after the water is added ; or serve the cutlets, covered with 
good mushroom sauce. 

HASHED calf's HEAD. (rEHOVE.) 

When the whole of this dish has to be prepared, make for it a 
quart of stock, and proceed in all else as directed for mock turtle 
soap (page 24) ; but after the head has been parboiled, cut down a 
fall pound and a half of it for the hash, and suce it small and thick, 
instead of dividing it into dice. Make the brains into cakes (see 
page 162), and garnish the dish with forcemeat - balls, rolled in 
eg^, and in the finest bread-crumbs, then fried a delicate brown, and 
irell drained, and dried upon a warm sieve reversed. The wine and 
other seasonings should be the same as for the soup. 

Rich gravy, 1 quart ; flesh of calf's head, full H lb. ; wine, and 
other seasonings, as for mock turtle soup. 

Obs. — The gravy for this should be stewed with ham, eschalots, 
ftc, exactly as for the soup.

TO DBBS8 COLD CALF'S HEAD OB TEAL 
A LA. XAITRB d'hOTEL. (gOOD.) 

(JBi^Ush ReeeipL) 

Cat into small delicate slices, or into sodlops of equal size, sufficient 
oold calf s head or veal for a dish. Next knead very smoothly 
together with a knife two ounces of butter, and a small dessertspoon- 
fm of flour ; put these into a stewpan or well tinned saucepan, and 
keep them stured or shaken over a gentle fire until they have 
simmered for a minute or two, but do not let them take the slightest 
colour; then add to them in very small portions (letting the sauce 
boil up after each is poured in) half a pint of pale veal gravy, or of 
ffood shin-of-beef stock, and when the whole is very smoothly 
blended, and has boiled for a couple of minutes, mix together and 
stir to it a tablespoonful of common vinegar, a dessertspoonful of 
chili vinegar, a little c^enne, a tablespoonful of good mushroom 
catsup, and a very tmau bit of sugar; and when the sauce again 
boils, strew a tablerooonful of minced parsley over the meat, lay it in, 
and let it stand by the fire xmtil it is quite heated through, but do not 
allow it to boil : if kept just at uie simmering point for ten or 
twelve minutes it may be served perfectly hot without. The addition 
of the mushroom catsup converts this into an English sanee, and 
renders it in colour, as well as in flavour, unlike the French one 
which bears the same name, and which is acidulated generally with 
lemon-juice instead of vinegai. Pickled mushrooms are sometimes 
added to the dish : the parsley when it is objected to may be omitted, 
and the yolks of two or three eggs mixed with a little cream may be 
stirred in, but not allowed to boil, just before the meat is serred. 
When veal is used for this hash instead of calf s head, it should \m

cat into slices not mach larger than a ahilling, and fieed entirely 
from fat, sinew, and the brown edges. When neither broth nor 
gravy is at hand, a morsel or two of lean ham, and a few of the 
trimmings or bones of the head or joint, may be boiled down to 
mpply its place.

calf's hsab VBXvrs. 

(AKAot'9 Receipt) 

Tlie half of a fine lam calf s head with the skin on, will beit 
answer for this brawn. Take out the brains, and bone it entirely, or 
nt the butcher do this ; rub a little fine salt over, and leave it to 
drain for ten or twelve hours ; next wipe it diy, and rub it well in 
every part with three quarters of an ounce of saltpetre finely 
powdered (or with an ounce should the head be verjf large) and 
mixed with four ounces of common salt, and three of bay-mlt, slso 
beaten fine ; turn the head daily in this pickle for four or five days, 
rubbing it a little each time ; and then pour over it four ounces of 
treacle, and continue to turn it every day, and baste it with the brine 
very frequently for a month. Hang it up for a night to drain, fold 
it in brown paper, and send it to be smoked where wood only is 
burned, from three to four weeks. When wanted lor table, wash 
and scrape it very dean, but do not soak it ; lay it, with the rind 
downwaras, into a saucepan or stewpan, which will hold it easilv; 
cover it wdl with cold water, as it will swell considerably in the 
cooking; let it heat rather slowly, skim it thoroughly when it first 
begins to sinmier, and boil it as gently as possible from an hour and 
three ouarten to a couple oi hours or more, should it not then be 
peffeeay tender ouite through; for unless sufficiently boiled, the 
akin, which ^eatly resembles brawn, will be unpleasantly toudh 
wben cold. When the fleshy side of the head is done, which willbe 
twenty minutes or half an hour sooner than the outside, pour the 
water from it, leaving so much only in the stewpan as will just cover 
the geliUinous part, and simmer it until this is thoroughly tender. The 



I thus cured is very highly flavoured, and most exceUent eating. 
The reedpt for it is entirely new, having originated with ourselves. 
We give tne reader, in addition, the result of out Jirst experiment with 
it, li^bkh was entirely successful : — ** A half calf s head, not veiy 
Ittge, without the skm, pickled with three ounces of common salt, 
two of bay-flnlti half an ounce of saltpetre, one ounce of brown 



216 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP.XS, 

Bugar, and hdfcai ounce of pepper ^ left four days ; then three ounces 
of treacle added, and the pickling continued for a month ; smoked 
nearly as long, and boiled between one hour and a half, and two 
hours.** The pepper was omitted in our second trial, because it did 
not improve the appearance of the dish, although it was an advan- 
tf^ in point of flavour. Juniper-berries might, we think, be added 
with advantage, when they are liked ; and cayenne tied in a muslin 
mieht supply the place of the pepper. It is an infinite improvement 
to nave the skin of the head left on. 

TO ROAST A FILLET OF TEAL. 

Take out the bone and put a pood roll of forcemeat (No. 1, 
Chapter YHL.) under the flap, dividmg first, with a sharp knife, the 
skin from the meat sufficiently to admit the quantity required; 
secure it well, truss the veal mmly into good shape, place it at a 
distance ijrom the fire at first, and baste it with butter. The outside 
will have a richer crust of browning if the meat be washed, wiped 
tolerably dry, and well floured before it is laid to the fire. It should 
be carenilly watched, and basted often, that the fat may not bum. 
Four melted butter over it after it is dished, and serve with it 
a boiled dieek of bacon and a lemon. Roast it from three hours and 
a half, to four hours and a half^ according to its size. 

FILLET OF TEAL^ AU BECHAMEL, WITH 0Y8TEB8. 

Roast, in the usual way, a delicate fillet of yeal, and in preparing 
it for the spit be careful to bind it up tightly, so that no cavity may 
be left where the bone has been taken out While it is at the fire* 
plump gently in their own strained liquor, without allowing them to 
Doil, half a pint of fine native oysters, and, afler having &ed them 
from the beards, set them aside ; then boil the beards for fifteen or 
twenty minutes in nearly three quarters of a pint of good veal stock, 
or in strong veal broth, made for the purpose ; strain them out, add 
the liquor of the oysters, also passed through a muslin or other fine 
strainer, and convert the broth into rich white sauce, of which there 
should be a full pint. When the veal is ready to serve, take it from 
the spit, dish it in a very hot dish, and cut out quickly from the 
centre in a cup-like form, about a pound of the meat, leaving a wide 
margin round the joint, to be carved in the usual way. Mince, as 
rapidly as possible, the white part of the veal which has been cut 
from the fillet, and the plumped oysters; put the whole into the 
white sauce, which should be ready heated, bring it to the foitd of 
boiling, pour it into the fillet, and send it immediately to table. The 
joint diould be placed under a well-heated cover, wnile the minoe is 
m course of preparation, and be kept near the fire. 

When the Knuckle of veal has been sent in with the fillet, a few 
thick slices from it may be taken for the sauce ; but it should be 



CHAT. XI.J VEAL. 217 



boiled do^n sufficiently early to allow it to cool, and to haye every 
partide of fat removed from it before it is used. A pound of the 
meat ought to make, with the addition of the oyster liq[uor, sufficient 
gravy for the sauce. When expense is not a consideration, the 
bechamel of Chapter Y. may be made for it, and the fillet may be 
filled up entirely with whole oysters heated in it ; or these may be 
intermixed with the veal cut into shilling-sized collops. Mushroom- 
buttons, stewed white in butter, can be substituted for the oysters, 
when their season is past; and very small force-meat bidls, deli- 
<atdy filed, may then be piled entirely over the open part of the 
fillet 

Persons who may take exception at the idea of oysters with roast 
veal^ as not being in accordance with the common etiquette of the 
table, are recommended to give the innovation a trial before they 
reject its adoption. 



BOILED FILLET OF TEAL. 

A small and delicately white fillet should be selected for this 
purpose. Bind it round with tape, after having washed it thoroughly ; 
cover it well with cold water, and bring it gently to boil ; watch, and 
clear off carefully, the scum as it rises, and be, at the same time, 
very cautious not to allow the water to become smoked. Let the 
meat be gendy simmered from three hours and a half to four and a 
half, according to its weight. Send it to table with rich white 
sauce, and a boUed tongue ; or make for it in the first instance the 
oyster forcemeat of Chapter YIII., and serve with the veal a tureen 
ii well-made oyster sauce. 

3^ to 4^ hours. 

ROABT LOm OF TEAL. 

It is not usual to stuff a loin of veal, but we greatly recommend 
the practice, as an infinite improvement to the joint. Make the 
same forcemeat as for the fillet ; and insert it between the skin and 
the flesh just over the ends of the bones. Skewer down the flap, 
place the joint at a moderate distance from a sound fire, keep it con- 
stantly basted, and be especially careful not to allow the kidney fat to 
bam : to prevent this, and to ensure the good appearance of the 
joint, a buttered paper is often fastened round the loin, and removed 
about half an hour before it is taken from the fire. It is the fashion 
in some counties to servo egg'sauce and brown gravy with roast 
knn, or breast of veal. 

The cook will scarcelv need to be told that she must separate the 
tbn from the flank, with a sharp knife, quite from the end, to the 
plaoe where the forcemeat is to be put, and then skevrer the whole

flour soon aner it is hud to the fire 
2 to 21 hoars. 

BOILED LOIN OF TEAL. 

If dressed with care and served with good sauces, this, when the 
meat is small and white is an excellent dish, and often more accept- 
able to persons of delicate habit than roast veal. Take from eight to 
ten pounds of the best end of the loin, leave the kidney in with all 
its fat, skewer or bind down the flap, lay the meat into cold water, 
and boil it as gently as possible from two hours and a c^uarter to two 
and a half, deanns off the scum perfectly, as in dressmg the fillet 
Send it to table with well-made oyster sauce, or bechamel, or with 
white sauce well flavoured with lemon-juice, and with paral^, 
boiled, pressed dry, and finely chopped. 

2i to 2i hours. 

6TEWBD LOIN OF TBAL* 

Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do; put into 
« larse, tnick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stewpan, about a 
couple of ounces of butter, and skake it over a moderate fire until 
it begins to brown; flour the veal well iJl over, lay it into the 
saucepan, and when it is of a fine, equal, light brown, pour gradually 
in veal broth, gravy, or boiling water to nearly half its depSi ; add a 
little sauce, one or two sliced carrots, a small onion, or more when 
the flavour is much liked, and a bimch of parsley ; stew the y&l 
very softly for an hour or rather more ; then turn it, and let it stew 
for nearly or quite another hour, or longer should it not be per- 
fectly tender. As none of our receipts mtve been tried with luge, 
coarse veal, the cooking must be r^ulated by that circumstance, imd 
longer time allowed should the meat be of more than moderate size. 
Dish the joint, skim all the fat from the gravy, and strain it over the 
meat ; or keep the joint hot while it is rapidly reduced to a richer 
consistency. This jb merely a plain family stew. 

BOILED BREAST OF VEAL. 

Let both the veal and the sweetbread be washed with exeeedini^ 
nicety, cover them with cold water, clear off the scum as it iiaes» 
throw in a little salt, add a bunch of parsley, a large blade of maoe, 
and twenty white peppercorns; ammer the meat from an hour to 
an hour and a quarter, and serve it covered with rich onion sanoe. 
Send it to table very hot The sweetbread may be taken up when. 
half done, and curried, or made into cutlets, or stewed in brown 
gravy. When onions are objected to, substitute white sauce and 
a cheek of bacon for them, or parsley and butter, if j^Ksferred to it

TO BONE A SHOULDER OF YBALy MUTTON, OR LAMB. 

Spread a dean cloth upon a table or 
drewer, and lay the joint ^t upon it, with 
the skin downwards; with a sharp knife 
cut off the flesh from the inner side nearly 
down to the blade bone, of which detach tlie 
edges first, then work the knife tader it, j 
keeping it always close to the hone^ and using 
aU possible precaution not to picroe the outer Shoulder ofVeU boned, 
akin ; when it is in every jMurt separated from the flesh, loosen it 
from the socket with the point of the knife, and remove it; or, with- 
out dividing the two bones, cut round the joint until it is freed 
entirely from the meat, and proceed to detach the second bone. 
Hiat of the knuckle is frequently left in, but for some dishes it is 
neoessarv to take it out; in doing this, be careful not to tear the 
dsm. A most excellent grill may be made by leaving sufficient 
meat for it upon the bones of a shoulder of mutton, when they are 
removed firom the joint: it will be found very superior to the 
broiled blade-bone of a roaxt shoulder, which is so much liked by 
many people. 

STEWED SHOULDER OF VEAL. 

{EngUtih Recent) 

Bone a shoulder of veal, and strew the inside thickly with savoury 
berbs minced small ; season it well with salt, cayenne, and pounded 
maee ; and place on these a layer of ham cut in thin slices and freed 
from rind and rust. Boll up the veal, and bind it tightly with a 
fillet; roast it for an hour and a half, then simmer it gently ib good 
brown gravv for five hours ; add forcemeat balls before it is dished; 
■kim we nt from the |pravy, and serve it with the meat. This 
ceoeipt, for which we are mdebted to a oorrtdipondent on whom we

can depend, and which we have not therefore conadered it necessaijr 
to test ourselres, is for a joint which weighs ten pounds before it is 
boned.

meat may be inserted between the skin and the flesh, bj first 
separating them with a sharp knife ; or the dish may be garnished 
with the forcemeat in balls. From an hour and a half to two hours 
will roast it. Pour melted butter over it when it is dish^ and 
serve it like other joints. Let it be floured when first laid to the 
fire, kept constantly basted, and always at a sufficient distance to 
prevent its being scorched.

admirers.** We transcribe the exact receipt for this dish, which wis 

Procured for us from a house in the dty, which is famed for it. We

of the flesh adhering to it It was roasted one hour, and aiswered 
extremely well. It is a convenient mode of dressing the flank of the 
Teal for eaters who do not object to the somewhat coarse savour of 
the preparation. When the tendrana or gristles of a breast, or part 
of a breast of yeal» are required for a separate dish, the remaining 
portion of the joint may be dressed in this way after the bones have 
been taken out; or, without removing them, the stuffing may be 
inserted under the skin. 

KNUCKLE OF TEAL EN RAGOUT. 

Cut in smaU thick slices the flesh of a knuckle of Teal, season it 
witii a little fine salt and white pepper, flour it lightly, and fry it in 
butter to a pale brown, lay it into a very dean stewpan or saucepan, 
and just cover it with boiling water; skim it clean, and add to it a 
faggot of thyme and parsley, the white part of a head of celery, a 
SD^l quanti^ of cayenne, and a blade or two of mace. Stew it 
very sofUy from an hour and three quarters to two hours and a 
half. Thicken and enrich the gravy u needful with rice-flour and 
mushroom catsup or Harvey*s sauce, or with a large teaspoonful 
of flour, mixed with a slice of butter, a little eood store-sauce and a 
glass of sherry or Madeira. Fried forcemeat balls of No. 1, Chapter 
vlLL maybe added at pleasure. With an additional quantity of 
water, or of broth (made with the bones of the joint), a pint and 
a half of young green peas stewed with the veal for an hour will 
give an agreeable variety of this dish. 

BOILED KNUCKLE OF TEAL. 

Afler the joint has been trimmed and well washed, put it into a 
vessel well adapted to it in size, for if it be very larse, so much 
water will be required that the veal will be deprived of its flavour; 
it should be well covered with it, and very gently boiled until it is 
perfectly tender in every part, but not so much done as to separate 
from the bone. Clear ofl^the scum with scrupulous care when the 
simmering first commences, and throw in a small portion of salt; 
aa this, if sparingly used, will not redden the meat,* and will other- 
wise much improve it. Parsley and butter is usually both poured 
over, and sent to table with a knuckle of veal, and boiled bacon 
also should accompany it. From the sinewy nature of this joint, 
it requires more tnan the usual time of cooking, a quarter of an 
hour to the pound not being sufficient for it. 

Teal 6 to 7 lbs. : 2 hours or more. 

KNUCKLE OF VEAL WITH RICE. 

Four over a small knuckle of veal rather more than sufficient 
«rater to cover it ; bring it slowly to a boil ; take off all the scum 



MODERN COOKEBT. [OHAP. zi. 

with great care, throw in a teaspoonful of salt, and when the joint 
has simmered for abont half an hour, throw in from eight to twelve 
ounces of well washed rice, and stew the veal gently for an hour 
and a half longer, or until both the meat and rice are perfectly 
tender. A seasoning of cayenne and maoe in fine powder with more 
salt, should it be required, must be added twenty or thirty minutes 
before they are serred. For a sapeiior stew good yeal broth may 
be substituted for the water. 

Yeal, 6 lbs.; water, 3 to 4 pints; salt, 1 teaspoonful: 80 to 40 
minutes. Rice, 8 to 12 oz: 1^ hour. 

Ob8,—A quart or even more of full grown green peas added to 
the Teal as soon as the scum has been cleared off will make a most 
excellent stew. It should be well seasoned with white pepper, imd 
the mace should be omitted. Two or three cucumbers, pared and 
freed from the seeds, may be sliced into it when it boils, or four 
or five younff lettuces shred small may be added instead. Green 
onions also, when they are liked, may be used to give it flaTonr. 

SMALL PAIN DB TEAV, OR, YEAL CASE. 

Chop separately and very fine, a pound and a quarter of yeil 
quite free from iat and skin, and six ounces of beef kidney-soet; 
add a teaspoonful of salt, a iiill third as much of white pepper and 
of mace or nutmeg, with the grated rind of half a lemon, and turn 
the whole well together with the chopping-knife until it is 
thoroughly mixed ; then press it smoothly into a small round boJdng 
dish, and send it to a moderate oven for an hour and a quarter. 
Lift it into a clean hot dish, and serre it plain, or with a little 
brown grayy in a tureen. Three ounces of the lean of a boiled ham 
minced small, will very much improve this cake, of which the 
size can pe increased at will, and proportionate time allowed for 
dressing it. If baked mh hot oven, the meat will shrink to half ita 
proper size, and be very dry. When done, it should be of a fine 
light brown, and like a cake in appearance.

side be dry. The bacon should be weighed after the rind, and any 
rust it may exhibit, have been trimmed from it This cake is ex- 
cellent cold, better indeed than the preceding one; but slices of 
cither, if preferred hot, may be warmed through in a Dutch oven, or 
on the gridiron, or in a few spoonsful of gravy. The same in- 
gredients made into small cakes, well floured, and slowly fHed from 
twelve to fifteen minutes, then served with gravy made in the pan as 
for cutlets, will be found extremely good. 

Yeal, 1| lb.; striped bacon, 8 oz.; salt and mace, 1 teaspoonful 
each; rind of lemon, 1; third of 1 nutmeg; cayenne, 4 grains;

FRIOAKDBAir OF TXAL. (ENTRifi). 

French cooks always prefer for this didi, which is a common one 
in their own country, that part of Ihe fillet to which the fat or 
udder is attached ;* but the flesh of the flner part of the neck or 
loin, raised clear from the bones, may be made to answer the purpose 
nearly or quite as well, and often much more conveniently, as the 
meat with us is not divided for «Je as in France ; and to purchase 
the entire fillet for the sake of the fricandeau would render it ex- 
eeedingly expensive. Lay the veal flat upon a table or dresser, 
with Sie skin uppermost, and endeavour, with one stroke of an 
exceedingly sharp knife, to dear this ofi^ and to leave the surface of 
the meat extremely smooth ; next lard it tiiickly with small lardoonsj 
as directed for a pheasant (page 181), and make one or two in- 
cisions in the imderside with uie point of a knife, that it may the 
better imbibe the flavour of the seasonings. Take a stewpan, of 
sufficient size to hold the fricandeau, and the proper quantity of 
vegetables compactly arranged, without much room bein^lefl round 
the me«t. Put into it a couple of large carrots, cut in thick slices, 
two omons of moderate size, two or tmee roots of parsley, three bay 
lesres, two small blades of maee, a branch or two of lemon thyme, 
and a little ca3renne, or a saltspoonfhl of white peppercorns. Eaise 
tiwse liigh in the centre of the stewpan, so as to support the meat,. 
and pr e v e nt its touching the gravy. Cover them with slices of very 
fiii bacon, and place the fricandeau gostly on them; then pour in as 
wmA. good veal broth, or stock, as will nearly cover the v^etables 
witboat reaching to the veid. A calfs foot, sj^lit in two, may with 
advantage be laid under them in the first instance. Stew the 
fiieandeau very gently for upwards of three hours, or until it is 
found to be extremely tender when probed with a fine skewer or a 
laidiDg-pin. Plenty of live embers must then be put on the lid of

the stewpan for ten minutes or a qoarter of an Hour, to render the 
lardoons firm. Lift out the fricandeau and keep it hot ; strain and 
reduce the gravy very quickly, after having skimmed off eyery 
particle of fat ; glaze the veal, and serve it on a ragout of sorrel, 
cucumbers, or spinach. This, though rather an elaborate receipt, 
is the best we can offer to the reader for a dish, which is now almost 
as fashionable with us as it is common on the Continent. Some 
English cooks have a very summary method of preparing it; they 
merely lard and boil the veal until they can '^cut it with a spoon,"^* 
then glaze and serve it with ** brown gjravv in the dish." This 
may be very tolerable eating, but it will bear small resemblance 
to the French fricandeau. 
3^ to 4 hours 

SPRINa-STEW OF VEAL. 

Cut two pound of veal, free from fat, into small half-inch thick 
cutlets; flour them well, and fry them in butter with two small 
cucumbers sliced, sprinkled with pepper, and floured, one moderate 
sized lettuce, and twenty-four green gooseberries cut open length- 
wise and seeded. When the whole is nicely browned, lift it into a 
thick saucepan, and pour gradually into the pan half a pint, or 
rather more, of boiling water, broth, or gravy. Add as much salt 
and pepper as it requires. Give it a minute*s simmer, and pour it 
over the meat, shaking it well round the pan as this is done. Let 
the veal stew gently from three quarters of an hour to an hour. A 
bunch of sreen onions cut small may be added to the other vege- 
tables if liked ; and the veal will eat better, if slightly seasoned with 
salt and pepper before it is floured ; a portion of fat can be left on it 
if preferred. 

Veal 2 lbs. ; cucumbers, 2 ; lettuce, 1 ; green gooseberries, 24 ; 
water or broth, i pint or more : f to 1 hour. 

NORMAN HARRICO. 

Brown in a stewpan or fry liffhtly, after having sprinkled them 
with pepper, salt, and flour, from two to three pounds of veal 
cutlets. If taken from the neck or loin, chop the bones very short, 
and trim away the greater portion of the fat. Arrange them as flat 
as the^ can be in a saucepan ; give a pint of water a boil in the pan 
in which they have been browned, and pour it on them ; add a small 
faggot of parsley, and, should tiie flavour be liked, one of green 
onions also. Let the meat simmer softly for half an hour ; then 
cover it with small new potatoes which nave had a single boil in 
water, give the saucepan a shake, and let the harrico stew very 
gently for another half hour, or until the potatoes are quite done, 
and the veal is tender. AVhen the cutlets are thick and the 
potatoes approaching their full size, more time will be required for 
the meat, and the vegetables may be at once divided : if extremely 



CHAP xj.] VEAL. 225 

yonng they will need the previous boil. Before the harrico is serredf 
skim the fat from it, and add salt and pepper should it not be 
suffidentlj seasoned. A few bits of lean ham, or shoulder of bacon 
browned with the Teal, will much improve this dish, and for some 
tastes, a little acid will render it more agreeable. Very delicate pork 
chops may be dressed in the same way. A cutlet taken from the 
fillet and freed from fat and skin, answers best for this dish. 
Additional v^etables, cooked apart, can be added to it after it is 
dished. Peas boiled very green and well drained, or young carrots 
sliced and stewed tender in butter, are both well suited to it. 

Veal, 2 to 3 lbs.; water (or gravy), 1 pint; new potatoes U to 2 
lbs. ; faggot, parsley, and green onions : 1 hour or more. 

PLAIN VEAL CUTLETS. 

Take them if possible free from bone, and after having trimmed 
them into proper shape, beat them with a cutlet-bat or paste-roller 
until the fibre of the meat is thoroughly broken ; flour them well to 
prevent the escape of the grav^^, and fry them from twelve to fifteen 
minutes over a nre which is not sufficiently fierce to bum them before 
they are quite cooked through : they should be of a fine amber brown, 
and perfectly dime. Lift them into a hot dish, pour the fat from the 
pan, throw in a slice of fresh butter, and when it is melted, stir or 
dredge in a dessertspoonful of flour ; keep these shaken imtil tiiey 
are well-coloured, then pour gradually to them a cup of gravy or of 
boiling water; add pepper, salt, a little lemon-pickle or juice, give 
the whole a boil, and pour it over the cutlets : a few forcemeat balls 
fried and served with them, is usually a very acceptable addition to 
this dish, even when it is eamished or accompanied with rashers of 
ham or bacon. A morsel mglaze^ or of the jelly of roast meat, should 
when at hand be added to the sauce, which a little mushroom powder 
would further improve: mushroom sauce, indeed, is considered by 
many epicures, as mdispensable with veal cutlets. We have recom- 
mended in this one instance that the meat should be thoroughly 
betUeUj because we find that the veal is wonderfully improved by the 
process, which, however, we still deprecate for other meat. 

12 to 15 minutes. 

VEAL CUTLETS A l'iNDIENNE, OR INDIAN FASHION. (eNTr£e.) 

Mix well together four ounces of very fine stale bread-crumbs, a 
teatpoonfal of salt, and a tablesnoonful of the best currie powder. 
Cut dovm into small well-shaped cutiets or coUops, two pounds of 
veal free from fat, skin, or bone ; beat the slices nat, and dip them 
fint into some beaten c^ff-yolks, and then Tuto the seasoned crumbs ; 
moisten them again with egg, and pass tuem a second time through 
bread-crumbs. When aU are ready, fry them in three or four ounces 
of b liter over a moderate fire, firam twelve to fourteen minutes. For

sauce, mix smoothly with a knife, a teaspoonful of flour and an equal 
quantity of curric-powder, with a small slice of butter ; shake these 
in the pan for about five minutes, pour to them a cup of gravy or 
boiling water, add salt and cayenne if required and the strained juice 
of half a lemon ; simmer the whole till well flavoured, and pour it 
*round the cutlets. A better plan is, to have some ^^ood currie sauce 
ready prepared to send to table with this dish ; which may likewise 
be served \nth only well-made common cutlet gravy, from the pan, 
ivhen much of the pungent flavour of the currie-powder is not 
desired. 

Bread-crumbs, 4 oz. ; salt, 1 teaspoonful ; currie powder, 1 table- 
spoonful ; veal, 2 lbs. : 12 to 14 minutes. 

Obs. — These cutlets may be broiled; they should then be well 
beaten first, and dipped into clarified butter instead of egg before they 
are passed through the curried seasoning. 

TEAL CUTLETS, OR COLLOPS, A LA FRAN9AISE. (eMTR£e.) 

Cut the veal into small, thin, round coUops of equal size, arrange 
them evenly in a saute -pan, or in a small frymg-pan, and sprinkle a 
little fine salt, white pepper, and grated nutmeg on them. Clanfy, 
or merely dissolve in a clean saucepan ivith a gentle d^ree of heat, 
an ounce or two of good butter, and pour it equally over the meat. 
Set the pan aside until the dinner-hour, then fry the coUops over a 
clear fire, and when they are lightly browned, which will be in from 
four to five minutes, lift them into a hot dish, and sauce them with a 
little Espagnoley or with a gravy made quickly in the pan, and fla- 
voured with lemon-juice and cayenne. They are excellent even 
without any sauce. 

8 to 4 mmutes. 

SCOTCH COLLOPS. (ENTr£e.) 

Prepare the veal as for the preceding receipt, but dip the collops 
into beaten egg and seasoned bread-crumbs, and fry them directly in 
good butter, over a moderate fire, of a light golden brown ; drain 
them well in lifting them from the pan, and sauce them like the 
collops d la Franqai$e. 

TEAL CUTLETS A LA MODE DE LONDRBS, OR, LONDOX 
FASHION. (entree.) 

Raise the flesh entire from the upper side of the best end of a nedi 
of veal, free it from the skin, and irom the greater portion of the firti 
slice it equally into cutlets little more than a quarter of an inch thidk, 
brush them with egg, strew them with fine bread-crumba, and fiy 
them of a light brown. Toast, or fry apart as many small slices of 
bacon as there are cutlets, and let them be trimmed nearly to the 



«HAP xt] VEAL. 227 

same shape ; place tbem alternately on their edges round the inside 
of a hot dish (so as to form a sort of chain), and nour into the middle 
some rich gravy made in the pan, and very sligntly flavoured with 
eschalot ; or substitute for this some good brown mushroom sauce. 
Saroury herbs, grated lemon-rind, nutmeg or mace, salt, and white 
pepper or cayenne, should be mixed with the bread-crumbs, in the 
proportions directed at page 213, for cutlets of calf's head; or the^ 
may be varied at pleasure. A cheek of bacon is best adapted to thu 

SWEETBREADS SIMPLY DBE89ED. (eNTr£e.) 

In whatever way sweetbreads are dressed, they should "first be well 
soaked in lukewarm water, then thrown into boiling water to blanch 
them, as it is called, and to render them firm. If lifted out after they 
hare boiled from five to ten minutes according to their size, and laid 
immediately into fresh spring water to cool, their colour will be the 
l)etter preserved. They may then be gently stewed for three quarters 
of an hour in veal gravy, which with the usual additions of cream, 
lemon, and egg-yolks, may be converted into a fricassee sauce for 
them when they are done ; or they may be lifted from it, glazed^ and 
-served with good Spanish gravy ; or, the fflazinff being omitted, they 
may be san^ with the sharp Maitre a Hotel sauce of page 117 
They may also be simply floured, and roasted in a Dutch oven, being 
often basted with butter, and frequently turned. A full sized sweet* 
bread, after having been blanched, will require quite three quarters 
of an hour to dress it. 

Blanched 5 to 10 minutes. Stewed f hour or more. 

SWEETBREAD CUTLETS. (ENTRis.) 

Boil the sweetbreads for half an hour in water or veal broth, and 
-when they are perfectly cold, cut them into slices of equal thickness, 
brush them with yolk of egg^ and dip them into very fine bread- 
crumbs seasoned with salt, cayenne, grated lemon-rind, and mace; 
£ry them in butter of a fine light brown, arrange them in a dish 
placing them high in the centre, and pour under them a gravy made 
m the pan, thickened with mushroom powder and flavoured with^ 
lemon-juice ; or, in lieu of this, sauce them with some rich brown 
ffravy, to which a glass of sherry or Madeira has been added. When 
u can be done conveniently, take as many slices of a cold boiled 
tongue as there are sweetbread cutlets; pare the rind from them, 
trim them into good shape, and dress them with the sweetbreads, 
after thc^ have been egged and seasoned in the same way; and place 
each cutlet upon a slice of tongue when they are dished. For variety, 
-substitute croutons of fried br«d stamped out to the size of the cutlets 
with a round or fluted paste or cake cutter. The crumb of a stale 
iott^ yeiy eyenly sliced, is best for the puipose.

STEWED calf's FEET. 
(Cheap and Oood,) 

This is an excellent family dish, highly nutritious, and often very 
inezpensiye, as the feet during the summer are usually sold at a low 
rate. Wash them with nicety, divide them at the joint, and split the 
claws ; arrange them closely m a thick stewpan or saucepan, and pour 
in as much cold water as will cover them ahout half an inch : tniee 
pints will he sufficient for a couple of large feet. When bro^ or 
stock is at hand, it is good economy to sulratitute it for the water, as 
h}^ this means a portion of strong and well-flavoured jellied gravy 
vnU be obtained for general use, the full quantity not being needed 
as sauce for the feet. The whole preparation will be much improved 
by laying a thick slice of the lean of an unboiled ham, knuckle of 
bacon, hung beef, or the end of a dried tongue, at the bottom of the 
pan, before the other ingredients are added ; or, when none of these 
are at hand, by suppling the deficiency with a few bits of lean beef 
or veal : the feet bemg of themselves insipid, will be much more 
palatable with one or the other of these additions. Throw in from 
naif to three quarters of a teaspoonful of salt when they begin to boil, 
and after the scum has been all cleared off, add a few branches of 
parsley, a little celery, one small onion or more, stuck with half a 
dozen cloves, a carrot or two, a large blade of mace, and twenty 
corns of whole pepper ; stew them softly until the flesh will part 
entirely from the bones ; take it from them, strain part of the gravy, 
and skim off all the fat, flavour it with catsup or any other store 
sauce, and thicken it, when it boils, with arrowroot or flour and 
butter ; put in the flesh of the feet, and serve the dish as soon as the 
whole is very hot. A glass of wine, a little lemon juice, and a few 
forcemeat balls, will convert this into a very superior stew ; a lumdful 
of mushroom- buttons also simmered in it for half an hour before it 
is dished, will vary it agreeably. 

Calfs feet (large), 2 ; water, 3 pints ; salt, } to | teaspoonful ; 
onions, 1 to 3 ; cloves, 6 ; peppercorns, 20 ; mace, large blade ; little 
celerv and parsley ; carrote, 1 or 2 : stewed softly, ^ to 3^ hours. 
Musnroom catsup, 1 tablespoonful ; flour, or arrowroot, 1 laige 
teaspooonful ; butter, 1 to 2 oz. Cayenne, to taste 

calf's liver stoted, or stewed. 

From three to four pounds of the best part of the liver will be 
sufficient for a dish of moderate size. First lard it quite through by 
the directions of page 181, with large lardoons, rolled in a seasoning 
of spice, and of savoury herbs very finely minced ; then lay it into a 
•tewpan or saucepan just fitted to its size, and pour in abont half a 



CHAP. ZI.J TEAL. 229 

pint of broth or gray^; heat it rerj gently, and throw in, when it 
b^ins to simmer, a sliced carrot, a soudl onion cut in two, a small 
bnnch of parsley, and a blade of mace ; stew the liver as softly as 
possible over a very slow fire from two hours and a half to three 
nours; thicken the gravy with a little brown roux (see pajo^ lOT), 
or with a dessertspoonful of browned flour; add a couple of glasses 
of white wine, and a little spice if needed, and serve it very hot, after 
having taken out the herbs and vegetable. 

The liver may be stewed without being larded ; it may likewise be 
browned all over in a carefully made roux^ before the ^ravy is 
poured to it : this must then be made to boil, and be added m small 
portions, the stewnan being well shaken round as each is thrown in. 
The wine can be altojB^ether omitted ; or a wineglassful of port mixed 
with a little lemon-juice, may take the place of sherry. After the 
liver has been wiped very dry, minced herbs may be strewed thickly 
over it before it is laid into the stewpan ; and it may be served in its 
own gravy, or with a *auce piguaate. 

Liver, 3 to 4lb8 : 2 to 3 iiours 

TO ROAST CALFS LIVER. 

Take the whole or part of a fine white sound liver, and either lard 
it as a fricandeau upon the surface, or with large strips of highly- 
seasoned bacon in the inside (see Larding, page 181^ ; or should 
either of these modes be objected to, merely wrap it in a well- 
buttered paper, and roast it from an hour to an hour and a quarter, 
at a moderate distance from a clear fire, keeping it constantly basted. 
Bemove the paper, and froth the liver well from ten to fifteen 
minutes before it is done. It should be served with a sauce of some 
piquancy, such as a poivrade^ or brown eschalot, in addition to some 
good gravy. Frencn cooks steep the liver over-ni^ht in vinegar, 
with a sliced onion and branches of savoury herbs laid over it : this 
whitens and renders it firm. As an economical mode, some small 
bits of the liver may be trimmed off, floured, and lightly fried with 
a siloed onion, and stewed down for gravy in three quarters of a pint 
of water which has been poured into the pan, with the addition of a 
few peppercorns, and a small bunch of herbs. A seasoning of salt 
must not be forgotten, and a little lemon pickle, or juice, would 
generally be considered an improvement. 

1 to 1| hour. 

BLANQUBTTE OF TEAL OR LAMB, WITH MUSHROOMS. 
(BNTniE.) 

Slice yery thin the white part of some cold veal, divide and trim 
it into scallops not larger tnan a shilling, and lay it into a clean 
saucepan or stewpan. Wipe with a bit of new flannel and a few 



23Q MODERN COOKERY. [ohap. XL 

grains of salt, from a quarter to half a pint of mushroom-buttons, 
and slice; them into a little butter which just begins to simmer ; stew 
them in it from twelve to fifteen minutes, without allowing them to 
take the slightest colour ; then lift them out and lay them on the 
veal. Pour boiling to them a pint of sauce tottmee Tsee page 108) ; 
let the blanquetie remain near, but not dose to the nre for awhile ; 
bring it nearer, heat it slowly, and when it is on the point of boilhig 
mix a spoonful or two of the sauce from it with tne well beaten 
yolks of four fresh eggs; stir them to the remainder; add die 
strained juice of half a small lemon; shake the saucepan above 
the fire until the sauce is just sel^ and serve the bkmquette 
instantly. 

Cold veal, } lb. ; mushrooms, i to ^ nint : stewed in 1} oz. butter, 
12 to 15 minutes. Sauce ioumie, or tnickened veal gravy, 1 pint; 
yolks of eggs, 4; lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful. 

Obs. — Ally white meat may be served en bkmquette. The mush- 
rooms are not indispensable for it, but they are always a great 
improvement. White sauce substituted for the thickened veal gravy 
will at once convert this dish into an inexpensive English fricassee 
Mace, salt, and cayenne, must be added to either preparation, should 
it require seasoning. 

MINOED YBAL. 

When there is neither gravy nor broth at hand, the bones and 
trimmings of the meat must be boiled down to furnish what is 
required for the mince. As .cold meat is very light in weight, a 
pound of the .white jiart of the veal will be sufficient for a disn, and 
n>r this quantity a pint of gravy will be needed. Break down the 
bones of the joint well, add uie trimmings of the meat, a small bunch 
of savoury herbs, a slice or two of carrot or of celery, a blade of 
mace, a few white peppercorns, and a bit or two of lean ham, boHed, 
or unboiled if it can be had, as either will improve the flavour of the 
mince. Four to these a pint and a half of water, and stew them 
genUy for a couple of hours ; then strain off the gravy, let it cool, 
and clear it entirely from the fat Cut the white part of the vetd 
small with a very sharp knife, after all the gristle and brown edges 
have been trimmed tLvm^, Some persons like a portion of flit 
minced with it, others object to the addition altogctner. Thicken 
the gravy with a teaspoonfiil and a half of flour smoothly mixed 
with a small slice of butter, season the veal with a saltspoonfVil or 
more of salt, and half as much white pepper and grated nutmeg, or 
pounded mace ; add the lightly-grated rmd of half a small lemon ; 
mix the whole well, put it mto the gravy, and heat it thoroughly by 
the side of the fire without allowing it to boil ; serve it with pafe 
toasted sippets in and round the dish. A spoonful or two of creank 
is always an improvement to thia mince.

UINCED TEAL AKD OYSTERS. 

The most elegant mode of preparing this dish is to mince ahont a 
pound of the wmtest part of the mside of a cold roast fillet or loin of 
veal, to heat it ^thout allowing it to hoil, in a pint of rich white 
B&nce, or becJuanel, and to mix with it at the moment of serying;, 
three dozens of small oysters ready hearded, and plnmped in their 
own strained liquor, which is also to he added to the mince; the 
requisite quantity of salt, cajenne, and mace should he sprinkled 
oyer the yeal hefore it is put into the sauce. Garnish the dish with 
pale fried sippets of hread, or with flewroM* of hrioche, or of puff- 
paste. Nearly half a pint of mushrooms minced, and stewed white 
in a little hutter, may he mixed with the yeal instead of the oysters; 
or should they he yery small they may he added to it whole : from 
ten to twelye minutes wiQ he sufficient to make them tender. BaJls 
of delicately fried oyster-forcemeat laid round the dish will giye 
another good yariety of it.

nearly a teaspoonftd of salt, a little cayenne, the third of a tea- 
spooDiul of mace or nutmeg, and four well-heaten eggs. Whisk up 
tne whole well together, put it into a buttered dish, and bake it from 
three quarters of an hour to an hour. Cream may he used instead 
of grayy when more conyenient, hut this last will giye the better

on both sides ^ but do not allow it to take the slightest colour. Stir 
in a tablespoonful of flour, and when it is well mixed with the 
cutlets, pour gradually to them, shaking the pan often, sufficient 
boiling veal-gravy to almost cover them. Stew them gently from 
Mecn to sixteen minutes, or longer should they not be perfectly 
tender. Add a flavouring of mace, some salt, a quarter-pint of ricn 
cream, a couple of ege-yolks, and a little lemon-juice, observing, 
when the last are add^ the directions given for a blanguette of veu,

pleasure. Two or three dozens of mushroom-buttons, added twenty 
minutes before it is served, will much improve this fricassee. 

SMALL ENTRiES OF SWEETBREADS, CALF's BRAINS AKD BARS, 

For tables of which the service consists rather of a great variety of 
light dishes (entries) than of substantial English fare, the ears, 
brains, sweetbreads, gristles or tendrans^ and the tail of a ciedf, may be 
dressed in many different ways to supply them ; but they require a 
really good style of cookery, and many adjuncts to render them 
available for the purpose, as they do not possess much decided 
natural flavour, and their insipidity would be apt to tire if it were 
not relieved by the mode of prepanng them. We shall give some 
few especial receipts for them m the chapter on foreign cookery, 
should sufficient space remain open for us to admit them ; and insert 
here only such slight general mrections as may suffice for preparing 
some of them in a simple form ; as they are not in reality or first- 
rate importance. All of them may be served with good curried, or 
highly-flavoured tomato-sauce, after having been stewed in strong 
broth or graver. The brains and sweetbreads cut into small dice or 
scallops, and mixed with bkhamel, or with common unite sai.^ may 
be used to fill small voUaU'vetds^ or patty cases. The cars are 
usually filled in part with forcemeat, or a preparation of the brains, 
and placed upright when dished ; and the upper part is cut into 
narrow fringe-like strips. For " Tendrons de Veau^' and " Breast of

TO CHOOSE MUTTON. 

Tile best mutton is Amall-boned, plump, finely-grained, and short- 
leta^ ; the lean of a dark, rather than of a bright hue, and the fat 
wnite and dear : iivhen this is yellow, the meat is rank, «nd of bad 
quality. Mutton is not considered by experienced judges to be in 
perfection until it is nearly or quite five years old ; but to avoid the 
additional expense of feeding the animal so long, it is commonly 
faroufi^ht into the market at Uiree years old. The leg and the loin 
are the superior joints ; and the preference would probably be given 
more frequently to the latter, but for the superabundance of its fat, 
which renders it a not very economical dish. The haunch consists of 
the leg and the part of the loin adioining it ; the saddle, of the two 
kuis together, or of the undivided hack of the sheep : these last are

always roasted^ and are served usually at good tables, or for com- 
pany-dinners, instead of the smaller joints. The shoulder, dressed in 
the ordinary way, is not very hignly esteemed, but when boned, 
rolled, and filled with forcemeat, it is of more presentable appear- 
ance, and to many tastes, far better eating ; though some persons 
prefer it in its natural form, accompanied by stewed onions. It is 
occasionally boiled or stewed, and covered with rich onion sance 
llie flesh of that part of the neck which is commonly .called the 
"best end,** or the bach ribsy and which adjoins the loin, is the most 
succulent and tender portion of the sheep, and makes an excellent 
small roast, and is extremely good served as cutlets, after being 
divested of the superabundant fat. It is likewise very frequently 
boiled ; but so cooked it makes but an unsightly and insipid dish, 
tiiough an idea prevails in this country that it is a very wholesome 
one. Cutlets (or chops^ as the butchers term them) are commonly 
taken from the loin, and are generally charged at a higher rate than 
joini* of mutton, in consequence, probably, of the constant demand 
for them. They may likewise be cut from the saddle, but will then 
be very large, and of no better quality than when the two loins which 
form the saddle are divided m the usual way, tl^pngh a certain 
degree of £uhion has of late been accorded to them.* The scrag, or 
that part of it which joins the head, is seldom used for any other 
purpose than making broth, and should be taken off before the joint 
IS dressed. Cutlets from the thick end of the loin are commonly 
preferred to anv others, but they are frequently taken likewise from 
the best end of the neck (sometimes called the back-ribs) and from 
the middle of the leg. Mutton kidneys are dressed in various ways, 
and are excellent in many. The trotters and the head of a sheep 
may be converted into verjr good dishes, but they are scarcely wortn 
the trouble which is reauired to render them palatable. The loin 
and the leg are occasionally cured and smoked like hams or bacon. 

TO ROAST A HAUNCH OF MUTTON, f 

This joint should be well kept, and when the larder-accommodations 
of a house not are good, the butcher should be requested to hang it 
the proper tune. Koast it carefully at a large sound fire, and let it 
remain at a considerable distance for at least a couple of hours ; then 
draw it nearer, but never sufficiently so to bum or injure the faL 
Keep it constantly basted ; flour it soon after it is laid to the fire, 
instead of frothing it, as this latter mode is not generally relished, 
^ough fashion is in its favour. In from three and a half to four 
hours, the haimch will be done, and it wiU require something less of

ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

This is an excellent joint, though not considered a verv economical 
one. It is usual for the butcher to raise the skin from it before it is 
sent in, and to skewer it on again, that in the roasting the juices of 
the meat may be better preserved, and the fat prevented from tidcing 
too much colour, as this should be but delicately browned. In. less 
than half an hour before the mutton is done, remove the skin, and 
flour the joint lightly after having basted it well. Our own great 
objection to frothed meat would lead us to recommend that the skin 
should be taken off half an hour earlier, and that the joint should be 
kept at sufficient distance from the fire to prevent the possibilitv of 
the fat being burned ; and that something more of time should be 
allowed for the roasting. With constant basting, great care, and good 
management, the cook may always ensure the proper appearance of 
this, or of any other joint (except, perhaps, of a haunch of venison) 
-mtibout having recourse to papering or pasting, or even to replacing 
the skin ; but when unremitted attention cannot be given to tnis one 
part of the dinner, it is advisable to take all precautions that can 
secore it from being spoiled.

TO BOAST A LEa OF MUTTON. 

In a cool and airy larder a leg of mutton will hang many days 
with advantage, if the kernel be taken out, and the flap wiped very 
diT when it is first brought in ; and it is never tender when freshly 
kafied : in warm weather it should be well dredged with pepper to 
preserve it from the files. K washed before it is put upon tne spit, it 
flhould be wiped as dry as possible afterwards, and well floured soon 
after it is laid to the fire. When the excellence of the joint is more 
xegparded than the expense of fuel, it should be roasted by what we 
haye denominated the slow method; that is to say, it should be kept 
at a considerable distance from the fire, and remain at it four hours 
instead of two : it may be drawn nearer for the last twenty or thirty 
minutes to give it colour. The gravy will flow from it in great 
abundance when it is cut, and the meat will be very superior to that 
roasted in the usual way. When this plan is not pursued, the mutton 
should stiU be kept quite a foot from the fire until it is heated 
through, and never brought sufficiently near to scorch or to herden 
any part. It should be constemUy hasted with its own fat, for if this 
be neglected, all other precautions will fail to ensure a good roast t

and after it is dished a little fine salt shoiAd be sprinkled lightly cm 
it, and a spoonful or two of boiling water ladled over. This is the 
most palatable mode of serving it, but it may be frothed when it is 
preferred so, though we would rather recommend that the floor 
should be dredged on in the first instance, as it then prevents the 
juices of the meat from escaping^ and forms a savoury coating to it; 
while the raw taste which it so oiten retains with mere frothing is to 
many eaters especially obiectionable. 

Leg of mutton, 7 to 8 lbs. : slow method 4 hours, common method 
1} to 2 hours. 

Obs, — Many common cooks ix^jure their roasts exceedingly by 
pouring abundance of hot water over them, "to make gravy ^ as 
they call it. This should never be done. The use of any portion 
may, perhaps, be rationally objected to ; but when the joint is not 
carefully cooked it is sometimes very dry without it. A few spoons- 
ful of Liebee*s extract of meat will supply excellent gravy for this, 
or for any otner dish of roasted meat 

BRAISED LEO OF MUTTON. 

Take out the bone as far as the first joint by the directions of the 
following receipt; roll some large strips of bacon in a seasoning of 
mixed spice, and of savoury herbs minced extremely fine or dried and 
reduced to powder, and with these lard the inside of the boned 
portion of the joint ; or fill the cavity with forcemeat highly sea- 
soned with eschalot or garlic. Sew up the meat, and place it in a 
braising-pan or ham-kettle nearly of its size, with slices of bacon 
under and over it, two or three onions, four or five carrots, two bay 
leaves, a large bunch of savoury herbs, a few bones, or bits of un- 
dressed mutton or veal, and about three quarters of a pint of gravy. 
Stew the meat as softly as possible from four to five hours, and keep 
live embers on the pan (or, as this mode of cooking is not gencrtd 
in England, set the mutton, if it can be done conveniently, into a 
moderately-heated oven, after having luted the edges of the vessel in 
which it is arranged with a bit of coarse paste) ; lift it out, strain the 
gravy, reduce it quickly to glaze, and brush the meat with it ; or 
merely strain, free it from fat, and pour it over the mutton. White 
beans (haricots blanc8\ boiled tender and well drained, or a mild 
ragout of garlic or escnalots, may be laid in the dish under it. The 
joint can be braised equally well without any part of it being booed.

the skin round it with great care, and the two hones can then he . 
drawn out without being divided. T his b eing done, fill the cavities 
with the forcemeat, No. 1. (Chapter Vlll.), fulding to it a somewhat 
high seasoning of eschalot, garlic, or onion ; or cut out with the bone, 
nearly a nound of the inside of the mutton, chop it fine with six 
ovmoes of delicate striped bacon, and mix with it thoroughly three 
quarters of an ounce of narsley, and half as much of tnyme and 
winter savoury, all mincea extremely small ; a half teaspoonful of 
pepper (or a third as much of cayenne) ; the same of mace, salt, and 
nutmeg, and either the grated rind of a small lemon, or four eschalots 
flnelv shred. When the lower part of the leg is filled, sew the skin 
neatly together where it has been cut open, and tie the knuckle 
itnind tightly, to prevent the escape of the gravy. Replace the fiat 
bone at the large end, and with a long needle and twine, draw the 
edfCB of the meat together over it. K it can be done conveniently, 
it » better to roast the mutton thus prepared in a cradle spit or upon 
s bottle-jack, with the knuckle downwurds. Place it at first far from 
the fire, and keep it constantly basted. It wiH require nearly or 
quite three hours roasting. Remove the twine before it is served, and 
aend it very hot to table with some rich brown gravy 

A BOILED LEO OF MUTTOX WITH TONGUE AND TURNIPS. 

(An excellent Receipt) 

Trim into handsome form a well-kept, but perfectly sweet leg of 
mutton, of middling weight; wash, but do not soak it ; lay it into a 
▼easel aa nearly of its size as convenient, and pour in rather more 
than aufiicient cold water* to cover it ; set it over a good fire, and 
when it begins to boil take off the scum, and continue to do so until- 
no more appears ; throw in a tablespoonful of salt (afler the first 
flkimming), which will assist to bring it to the surface, and as soon 
as the liquor is clear, add two moderate-sized onions stuck with a 
dozen cloves, a large faggot of parsley, thyme, and winter savoury, 
sod four or five large carrots, and half an hour afterwards as many 

* We hare left this receipt unaltered, ioetead of applying to it Baron Liebeg's 
directions tar his improved method of boiling meat, becanse his objections to the 
iiBiiieman of the joint in cold water are partially obviated, by its being placed 
iBBanediately over a sound fire, and heated qnickly ; and the mutton is very good 
QttM dressed. 



238 HODEBK COOKERT. [cHAP. xn. 

tumipB. Draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let the mutton be 
simmered gently from two hours to two and a half, from the time of 
its first beginning to boil. Serve it with caper, brown cucumber, or 
oyster sauce. If stewed softly^ as we have directed, the mutton will 
be found excellent dressed thus ; otherwise, it will but resemble the 
unpalatable and ragged-looking joints of fast-boiled meat, so con- 
stantly sent to table by common English cooks. Any undressed 
, bones of veal, mutton, or beef, boiled with the joint will improve it 
much, and the liquor will then make excellent soup or houiUon. 

A small smoked ox-tongue boiled very tender will generally be 
much approved as an accompaniment to tne mutton, though it is out 
of the usual course to serve them together : innovation on established 
usages is, however, sometimes to be recommended. The tongue 
should be garnished with well-prepared mashed turnips, moulded 
with a tablespoon into the form of a half-egg, and sent to table as hot 
as possible ; or the turnips may be dished apart 

2 to 2i hours. 

ROAST OK STEWED FILLET OP MUTTON. 

Cut some inches from either end of a large and well-kept leg of 
mutton, and leave the fillet shaped like one of veal. Remove the 
bone, and fill the cavity with forcemeat (No. 1, Chapter VIII.), which 
may be flavoured with a little minced eschalot, when its flavour is 
liked : more forcemeat may be added by detaching the skin sufiS- 
ciently on the flap side to admit it. When thus prepared, the fillet 
may be roasted, and served with currant-jelly and brown gravy, or 
with only melted butter poured over it ; or it may be stewed gently 
for nearly or quite four hours, in a pint of gravy or broth, after 
having been floured and browned all over in a couple of ounces of 
butter : it must then he turned every hour that it may be equally 
done. Two or three small onions, a faggot of herbs, a couple of 
carrots sliced, four or five cloves, and twenty whole peppercorns can 
be added to it at will. 

Boasted 2 hours, or stewed 4 hours. 

06«.— At a large fire, half an hour less of time will roast the mut- 
ton sufficiently for English taste in general. 

TO ROAST A LOIN OF MUTTON. 

The flesh of the loin of mutton is superior to that of the leg, when 
roasted ; but to the frugal housekeeper this consideration is usually 
overbalanced by the great weight offat attached to it; this, however, 
when economy is more considered than appearance, may be pared oft 
and melted down for various kitchen uses. TVlien thus reduced is 
size, the mutton will be soon roasted. If it is to be dressed in the 
usual way, the butcher should be desired to take off the skin ; and care 
should be taken to preserve the fat from being ever so lightly btuned t 



CHAP, xn.] JIUTTON* 239 

it should be managed, indeed, in the same manner as the saddle, in 
every respect, and carved also in the same way, either in its entire 
length or in oblique slices. 

Without the fat, 1 to 1 J hour ; with 1 J to If hour. 

TO DRESS A LOIN OP MUTTON LIKE VENISON. 

Skin and bone a loin of mutton, and lay it into a stewpan, or 
braisin^-pan, with a pint of water, a large onion stuck with a dozen 
clovc8,lialf a pint of port wine and a spoonful of vinegar ; add, when 
it boils, a smafl faggot of thyme and parsley, and some pepper and 
salt : let it stew three hours, and turn it often. Make some gravy of 
the bones, and add it at intervals to the mutton when requir^ ' 

This receipt comes to us bo strongly recommended by persons who 
have partaken frequently of the dish, that we have not thought it 
ueedful to prove it ourselves. 

3 hours. 

ROAST NECK OP MUTTON. 

This is a very favourite joint in many families, the flesh being 
more tender and succulent than that even of the loin ; and when 
only a small roast is required, the best end of the neck of mutton, or 
the middle, if divested of a large portion of the fat and cut into ffood 
shape, will furnish one of appropriate size and of excellent quiuity. 
Let the ends be cut quite even and the bones short, so as to give a 
haadsome squareness of form to the meat. The butcher, if dii^ected to 
do so, will cnop off the chine bone, and divide the long bones suf- 
ficiently at the joints to prevent any difficulty in separating them at 
table. From four to five pounds weight of the neck will require 
from an hour to an hour and a quarter of roasting at a clear and 
brisk, but not Jierce, fire. It should be placed at a distance until it 
is heated through, and then moved nearer, and kept thoroughly basted 
untU it is done. Tomatas baked or roasted may be sent to table with< 
it ; or a little plain gravy and red currant-jelly ; or it may be served' 
without either. 

When the entire joint, with the exception of the scrag-end (which 
should always be taken off), is cooked, proportionate time must be 
allowed for it. 

TO ROAST A SHOULDER OP MUTTON. 

Flour it well, and baste it constantly with its own dripping ; do 
not place it dose enough to the fire for the fat to be in the slightest 
decree burned, or even too deeply browned. An hour and a half 
will roast it, if it be of moderate size. Stewed onions are often sent 
to table with it. A shoulder of mutton is sometimes boUedf and 
SDOthered with onion sauce

THE cavalier's BROIL. 

Ilall roast or stew, or parboil, a small, or moderate-sized shoulder 
of mutton ; lift it into a not dish, score it on both sides down to the 
bone, season it well with fine salt and cayenne or pepper, and finish 
cooking it upon the mdiron over a brisk fire. Skim the fat from 
any grraT^ that may have flowed from it, and keepthe dish which 
contains it quite hot to receive the joint again. Warm a cupful of 
pickled mushrooms, let a part of them be minced, and strew them 
over the broil when it is ready to be served ; arrange the remainder 
round it, and send it instantly to table. The reader will sctfcely 
need to be told that this is an excellent dish 



FORCED SHOULDER OF MUTTON. 

Cut off all the flesh from the inside of the joint down to &e blade- 
bone, and reserve it for a separate dish. It may be lightly browned 
with some turnips or carrots, or both, and made into a small harrico 
or stewed simply in its own gravy, or it will make in part, a pie or 
pudding. Bone the mutton (see page 219), flatten it on a table, lay 
over the inside some thin and neatlv-trimmed slices of striped bacon, 
and spread over them some good veal forcemeat (No. 1, Chapter YIIL) 
to within an inch of the outer edge ; roll the joint up tightly towards 
the knuckle (of which the bone may be left in or not, at pleasure), 
secure it well with tape or twine, and stew it gently in good gravy, 
from four hours to four and a half. 

4 to 41 hours. 

Obs, — In France it is usual to substitute sausage-meat for the bacon 
and veal stufling in this dish, but it does not appear to us to be well 
suited to it 

MUTTON CUTLETS STEWED IN THEIR OWN GRAVY. 

(Good.) 

Trim the fat entirely from some cutlets taken from the loin ; just 
dip them into cold water, dredge them moderately with pepper, and 
plentifully on both sides with flour ; rinse a thick iron saucepan with 
spring water, and leave three or four tablespoonsful in it; arrange 
tne cutlets in one flat layer, if it can be done conveniently, and place 
them over a very gentle fire ; throw in a little salt when they b^^ 
to stew, and let them simmer as softly as possible^ but without ceasing, 
from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half If dressed with 
great care, which they require, they will be equally tender, easy of 
digestion, and nutritious ; and being at the same time free from every- 
thmg which can disagree with Uie most delicate stomach, the reoeipt 
will be found a valuable one for invalids. The mutton should be of 



CHAP, xn.] MUTTON. 241 

good quality, but tbe excellence of tbe dish mainly depends on 
Its being most gently stewed; for if allowed to boil quickly all 
the gravy will be dried up, and the meat will be unfit for table. 
The cutlets must be turned when they are half done : two or three 
spoonsful of water or gravy may be added to them should they 
not yield sufficient moisture; or if closely arranged in a single 
layer at first, water may be poured in to naif their depth. Tne 
advantage of this receipt is, that none of the nutriment of the 
meat is lost ; for that which escapes from the cutlets remains in 
the gravy, which should all be served with them : any fat which 
may be perceived upon it should be carefully skimmed off. Cold 
broth used for it instead of water will render it extremely good, 
li to If hour. 

TO BROIL MUTTON CUTLETS. (eNTR^E.) 

These may be taken from the loin, or the best end of the neck, but 
the former are generally preferred. Trim off a portion of the fat, or 
the whole of it, unless it be liked ; pepper the cutlets, heat the grid- 
iron, rub it with a bit of the mutton suet, broil them over a bjisk 
fire, and turn them often until they are done ; this, for the generality 
of eaters, will be in about eight minutes, if they are not more than 
half an inch thick, which they should not be. French cooks season 
them with pepper and salt, and brush them lishtly with dissolved 
butter or ou, Ij^fore they are laid to the fire, ana we have found the 
cutlets so managed extremely good. 

Lightly broiled, 7 to 8 minutes. Well done, 10 minutes. 

O&.—A cold MaStre d*Hotel sauce may be laid under the cutlets 
when they are dished ; or they may be served quite dry, or with 
brown gravy ; or with ^ood melted butter seasoned with mushroom 
catsup, cayenne, and chili vinegar or lemon-juice.

Keep the whole well stirred with a fork ovet a clear and gentle fire

s couple of hours. One or even two half-grown cucumbers, cut 
small by scoring the ends deeply as they are sliced, or a quarter of a 
pint of^^ minced mushrooms may be added with good effect; or a 
dessertspoonful of currie-powder and a large chop|]«d onion. A dish

A GOOD FAMILY STEW OP MUTTON. 

Put into a broad stewpan or saucepan, a flat layer of mutton chops, 
freed entirely from fat and from the greater portion of the bone, or in- 
preference a cutlet or two from the leg, divided into bits of suitable 
size, ^en just dipped into cold water, seasoned with pepper, and lightly 
dredged with flour ; on these put a layer of mild turnips sliced hafr 
an inch thick, and cut up into squares ; then some carrots of the 
same thickness, with a seasoning of salt and black pepper between 
them ; next, another layer of mutton, then plenty of vegetables, and 
as much weak broth or cold water as will barely cover the whole ; 
bring them slowly to a boil, and let them just simmer from two io 
three hours, according to the quantity. One or two minced onions 
may be strewed between the other v^tables when their flavour is 
liked. The savour of the dish will be increased by browning the 
meat in a little butter before it is stewed, and still more so by nying 
the vegetables lightly as well, before they are added to it A head 
or two of celery would to many tastes improve the flavour of the 
whole. In summer, cucumber, green omons, shred lettuces, and 
green peas may be substituted for the winter vegetables. 

Mutton, free from fat, 2} lbs. ; turnips, 3 lbs ; carrots, 3 lbs. f 
celeiT (if added), 2 small heads : 2 to 3 hours. 

Obs. — The fat and trinunines of the mutton used for this and for 
other dishes into which only the lean is admissible, may be turned to- 
useful account by cutting the whole up rather small, and then, 
boiling it in a quart of water to the pound, with a little spice, a 
bunch of herbs and some salt, until the fat is nearly dissolved: the 
liquid will then, if strained off and left until cold, make tolerable 
broth, and the cake of fat which is on the top, if again just melted 
and poured free of sediment into small pans, will serve excellentlj 
for conmion pies and for frying kitchen dmners. Less water will of 
course produce broth of better quality, and the addition of a small 
quantity of fresh meat or bones will render it very good. 

AN IRISH STEW. 

Take two pounds of small thick mutton cutlets with or without 
fat, according to the taste of the persons to whom the stew is to be 
served ; take also four pounds of good potatoes, weighed after they 
are pared ; slice them thick, and put a portion of them in a flat 
layer into a large thick saucepan or stewpan ; season the mutton well 
with pepper, and place some of it on the potatoes ; cover it with 
another layer, and proceed in the same manner with all, reserving 
plenty of the vegetable for the top ; pour in three quarters of a pink 



csAP. zn.] MUTTOK. 843 

of cold water, and add, when the stew hegins to hofl, an ounce of 
salt; let it siinmer gently for two hours, and serve it yery hot. 
When the addition of onion is liked, strew some minced oyer the 
potatoes. 

Mutton cutlets, 2 lbs. ; potatoes, 4 lbs. ; pepper, } oz. ; salt, 1 oi. ; 
water, | pint : 2 hours. 

Oft*.— For a real Irish stew the potatoes should be boiled to a 
mash : an additional quarter of an nour may be necessary for the 
full quantity here, but for half of it two hours are quite sufficient 

A BAKED IRISH STEW. 

TtU a brown upright Nottingham jar with alternate layers of 
mutton (or beef), sliced potatoes, and mild onions ; and put in water 
and seasoning as above ; cover the top closely with whole potatoes 
(pared), and send the stew to a moderate oven. The potatoes on the 
top should be well cooked and hroumed before the stew is served. 
We have not considered it necessary to try this receipt, which was 
given to us by some friends who keep an excellent table, and who 
recommended it much. It is, of course, suited only to a quite plain 
iamUy dinner. The onions can be omitted when their flavour is not 
liked. 

CUTLETS OF COLD MUTTON. 

Trim into well-shaped cutlets, which should not be very thin, the 
remains of a roast loin or neck of mutton, or of a qmte under- 
dressed stewed or boiled joint ; dip them into egg and well-seasoned 
bread-crumbs, and broil or fry them over a quick fire that they may- 
be browned and heatod through without beinK too much done. This 
is a very good mode of serving a half roasted loin or neck. When 
the cutlets are broiled they should be dipped into, or sprinkled 
thickly with butter just dissolved, or they will be exceedingly dry ; a 
few additional crumbs should be made to adhere to them aner they 
are moistened with this. 

MUTTON KIDNEYS A LA FRANQAISE. (ENTRiE.) 

Skin six or eiffht fine firesh mutton kidneys, and without opening 
them, remove tne fat ; slice them rather thin, strew over them a 
large dessertspooniul of minced herbs, of which two-thirds should be 
pardey and the remainder thyme, with a tolerable seasoning of 
pepper or cayenne, and some mie salt Melt two ounces of butter 
in a frying-pan, put in the kidneys and brown them quickly on both 
sides; when nearly done, stir amongst them a dessertspoonful of 
flour and shake lliem well in the pan ; pour in the third of a pint of 
gravy (or of hot water in default of this), the juice of half a lemon, 
and as much of HiEiryey*s sauce, or of mushroom catj^up. as will

Kidnejs first, give the saacc a boil and pour it on them. In France, 
a couple of glasses of champagne, or, for variety, of claret, are fre- 
quently added to this dish : one of port wine can be substituted for 
cither of these. A dessertspoonful of minced eschalots may be 
strewed over the kidneys with the herbs; or two dozens of very 
small ones previously stewed until tender in fresh butter over a 
gentle fire, may be added after they are dished. This is a very ex- 
cellent and approved receipt. 
Fried 6 minutes. 

BROILED MUTTON EIDNEYS. 

Split them open lengthwise without dividing them, strip off the 
skin and fat, run a fine skewer through the points and across the 
back of the kidneys to kee|) them flat while broiling, season them 
with pepper or cayenne, lay them over a dear brisk fire, with the cut 
sides towards it, turn them in from four to five minutes, and in as 
many more dish, and serve them quickly, with or .without a cold 
Mfdtre d*Hotel sauce under them. French cooks season them with 
pepper and fine salt, and brush a very small quantity of oil or cla- 
rified butter over them before they are broiled : we think this an 
improvement. 

8 to 10 minutes. 

OXFOKD RECEIPT FOR MUTTON KIDNEYS. (BREAKFAST DISH, 
OR ENTREE.) 

Fry gently in a little good butter, a dozen croutons (slices of bread, 
of uniform shape and size, trinuned free from crust), cut half an 
inch thick, about two inches and a half wide, and from three to four 
in length : lift them out and keep them hot. Split quite asunder tax 
fine fresh kidnevs, after having freed them from the skin and &t; 
season them with fine salt and cayenne, arrange them evenly in a 
dean frying-pan, and pour some clarified butter over them. Fiy 
them over a somewhat brisk fire, dish each half upon a crouton^ make 
a sauce in the pan as for veal cutlets, but use gravy for it instead of 
water, should it be at hand ; add a little wine or catsup, pour it roand 
the croutons^ and serve the kidneys instantly. 

10 minutes. 

TO ROAST A FORE QUARTER OF LAMB. 

This should be laid to a clear brisk fire, and carefully and plen- 
tifully basted firom the time of its becoming warm until it is ready 
for table ; but though it requires quick roasting, it must never be 
placed sufficiently near the fire to endanger the fat, which is very 
liable to catch or bum. A\lien the ioint is served, the shoulder 
should be separated from the ribs with a sharp knife ; and a small 
slice of fresh butter, a little cayenne, and a squeeze of lemon juice

■hoold be laid between them ; if the cook be an expert carver, this 
had better be done before the lamb is sent to table. The cold 
Afidtre tTHotel sauce of Chapter VI. may be substituted for the usual 
ingredients, the parsley being omitted or not, according to the taste. 
S^e good mint sauce, and a fresh fialad with this roast. 

A leg, shoulder, or loin of lamb should be cooked by the same 
directions as the quarter, a difference only being made in the time 
allowed for each. 

Fore quarter of lamb, If to 2 hours. Leg, 11 hour (less if very 
small) ; shoulder, 1 to 1^ hour. 

06i.--The time will vary a little, of course, from the difference in- 
the weather, and in the strength of the fire. Lamb should always 
be ttxe^f roasted. 

SADDLE OF LAMB. 

This is an exceedingly nice joint for a small party. It should be 
roasted at a brisk fire, and kept constantly basted with its own 
dripping : it will require from an hour and three quarters to two 
hours roasting. Send it to table with mint sauce, brown cucumber 
sauce, and a salad. 

It to 2 hours. 

Ob$. — The following will be found an excellent receipt for mint 
sanoe : — ^With three heaped tablespoonsful of finely-chopped young 
mint, mix two of pounded and sifted sugar, and six of the best 
vinegar : stir it until the sugar is dissolved. 

ROAST LOIN OF LAMB 

Place it at a moderate distance from a clear fire, baste it frequently, 
froth it when nearly done, and serve it with the same sauces as 
the preceding joints. A loin of lamb may be boiled and sent to table 
with white cucumber, mushroom, common white sauce, or parsley 
and butter. 

1 to 1^ hour. 

STEVFED LEa OF LAMB WITH WHITE SAUCE. (eNTr£b.)* 

Choose a small plump leg of lamb, not much exceeding five pounds 
in weight ; put it mto a vessel nearly of its size, with a few trimmings 
or a bone or two of undressed veal if at hand ; cover it with warm 
water, bring it sdowly to a boil, clear off the scum with great care 
when it is first thrown to the surface, and when it has all been 
flkimmed off, add a faggot of thyme and parsley, and two carrots of 
moderate size. Let the hunb simmer only, but without ceasing, for 
«n hour and a quarter; serve it covered with bechamel^ or rich 
"Rnglinh white sauce, and send a boiled tongue to table with it, and 
0oroe of the sauce in a tureen 

1:^ hour. 

* This may bo served as a remove in a amlll imceremonious dinner. 



246 HODEBN COOKXBT. [chap.xh. 



LOIN OF LAMB STEWED IN BUTTER. (bNTr£e.) 

Wash the joint, and wipe it ver^ dry ; skewer down the flap, and 
lay it into a close-phutting and thick stewpan or saucepan, in which 
three ounces of good butter have been just dissolved, but not allowed 
to boil ; let it simmer slowly over a very gentle fire for two hours 
and a quarter, and turn it when it is rather more than half done. 
Lift it out, skim and pour the fpcsLYj over it ; send asparagus, cucum- 
ber, or saubUe sauce to table with it ; or brown gravy, mint sauce, 
and a salad. 

2i hours. 

LAMB OR MUTTON CUTLETS, WITH SOUBISE SAUCE. (eNTr£e.) 

The best- end of two necks of either will be required for a hand- 
some dish. Cut them thin with one bone to each ; trim off the fat 
and all the skin, scrape the bones very clean that they may look 
white, and season the cutlets with salt and white pepper ; brush them 
with egg, dip them into very fine bread-crumbs, tnen into clarified 
butter, and again into the bread-crumbs, which should be flattened 
evenly upon them, and broil them over a vexy clear and brisk fixe, 
or fry them in a little good butter of a fine clear brown ; press them 
in two sheets of white blotting paper to extract the grease, and dish 
iJiem in a circle, and pour into the centre a saubise sauce, or 9^ puree 
of cucumbers. Brown cucumber sauce or a rich gravv, may be sub- 
stituted for either of these in serving a quite simple dmner. Cutlets 
of the loin may be dressed in the same way after being dipped into 
crumbsof bread mixed with a full seasoning of minced herbs, and 
with a small quantity of eschalot when its flavour is liked. The 
small flat bone at the end of the cutlets should be taken off, to give 
them a good appearance. 

LAMB CUTLETS IN THEIR OWN GRATY. 

Follow exact] V the receipt for mutton cutlets dressed in the same 
way, but allow for those of lamb fifteen or twenty minutes less of 
tiine, and an additional spoonful of liquid.

TO CHOOSE P09K. 

This meat is so pToyerbially, and we believe even dangerously un- 
vholeaome when ill fed, or in any degree diseased, that its quality 
should be closely examined before it is purchased. When not home- 
reared, it should be bought if possible of some respectable farmer or 
miller, unless the butcher who supplies it can be perfectly relied on. 
Both the fat and lean should be very white, and the latter finely 
grained ; the rind should be thin, smooth, and cool to the touch ; if 
It be clammy, the pork is stale, and should be at once rejected; it 
ought also to be scrupulously avoided when the fat, instead of being 
quite clear of all blemish, is full of small kernels which are indicative 
of disease. The manner of cutting up the pork varies in different 
counties, and also according to the purposes for which it is intended. 
The le^ are either made into hams, or slightly salted for a few days 
and boiled ; they are also sometimes roasted when the pork is not 
large nor coarse, with a savoury forcemeat inserted between the skin 



MODERN COOKEEY. [chap. xxA. 

and flesh of the knuckle. The part of the shoulder proTincially 
called the hand, is also occasionally pickled in the same way as hams 
and bacon, or it is salted and boiled, but it is too sinewy for roasting. 
After these and the head have been taken off, the remainder, without 
further division than being split down the back, may be converted 
into whole sides, or flitches as they are usually called, of bacon ; but 
when the meat is large and required in part for various other pur- 
poses, a chine may be taken out, and the fat pared off the bones o£ 
the ribs and loins for bacon ; the thin part of the body converted into 
pickled pork, and the ribs and other bones roasted, or made into 
pies or sausages. The feet, which are generally salted down for 
immediate use, are excellent if laid for two or three weeks into tHe 
same pickle as the hams, then well covered with cold water, and 
slowly boiled until tender. 

The loins of young and delicate pork are roasted with the skin on ; 
and this is scored in regular stripes of about a quarter of an inch wide 
with the point of a sharp knife, before the joints are laid to the fire. 
The skin of the leg also is just cut through in the same manner. 
This is done to prevent its blistering, and to render it more easj to 
carve, as the skin (or crackling) ^comes so crisp and hard in tbe 
cooking that it is otherwise sometimes difficult to divide it. 

To be at any time fit for table, pork must be per/ectlff sweet, and 
thoroughlv cooked ; great attention also should be given to it when 
it is in pickle, for if any part of it be long exposed to the air, without 
being turned into, or well and frequently basted with the brine, it will 
often become tainted during the process of curing it. 

TO MELT LARD. 

Strip the skin from the inside fat of a freshly killed and well-fed 
pig ; slice it small and thin ; put it into a new or well-scalded jar, 
set it into a pan of boiling water, and let it simmer over a dear fire. 
As it dissolves, strain it into small stone jars or deep earthen p&QS, and 
when perfectly cold, tie over it the skin that was cleared from the 
lard, or bladders which have been thoroughly washed and wiped very 
dry. Lard thus prepared is extremely pure in flavour, and keeps 
perfectly well if stored in a cool place ; it maybe used with advantage 
m making common pastry, as well as for frying fish, and for varioos 
other purposes. It is better to keep the last drunings of the &t apa^ 
from that which is first poured off, as it will not be quite so fine in 
quality. 

TO PRESERVE UNMELTED LARD FOR MANY MONTHS. 

For the particular uses to which the leaf-fat, or fleed, can be ad- 
vantageously applied, see fleed-crust. Chapter XVIII. It may be kept 
well during the summer months by rubbmg fine salt rather plenti- 
fully upon it when it is first taken from the pig, and letting it lie for 
a couple of days ; it should then be well dramed, and covered with t

ftron;^ brine ; this in wanner weather should be changed occasionally. 
When wanted for use, lay it into cold water for two or three hours, 
then wipe it dry, and it will have quite the eflfect of the fresh fleed 
when made into paste. 

Inner fat of pig, 6 lbs. ; fine salt, i to } lb. : 2 days. Brine ; to 
each quart of water, 6 oz. salt. 

TO ROAST 

After the pig has been 
scalded and prepared for 
the spit, wipe it as dry as 
possible, and put into the 
Dody about half a pint of 
fine bread-crumbs, mixed 
with three heaped tea- 
spoonsful of sage, minced 
very small, three ounces of 
good butter, a large snlt- 
spoonful of salt, and two-thirds as much of pepper or some cayenne. 
&w it up with soil, but strong cotton ; truss it as a hare, with the 
fore legs skewered back, and the hind ones forward; lay it to a strong 
clear fire, but keep it at a moderate distance, as it would quickly 
blister or scorch if placed too near. So soon as it has become warm, 
rub it with a bit of butter tied in a fold of muslin or of thin cloth, 
and repeat this process constantly while it is roasting. When the 
gravy begins to drop from it, put basins or small deep tureens under, 
to catch it in.* As soon as the pig is of a fine light amber brown 
and Uie steam draws strongly towards the fire, wipe it quite dry with 
a dean cloth, and rub a bit of cold butter over it. When it is half 
done, a pig iron, or in lieu of this, a large flat iron should be hung 
in the centre of the grate, or the middle of the pig will be done long 
before the ends. When it is ready for table lay it into a very hot 
dish, and before the spit is withdrawn, take off and open the head 
and split the body in two ; chop toother quickly the stuffing and the 
brains, put them into half a pint of good veal gravy ready thickened, 
fidd a glass of Madeira or of sherry, and the gravy which nas dropped 
from the pig ; pour a small portion of this under the roast and serve 
the remainder as hot as possible in a tureen : a little pounded mace 
and cayenne with a squeeze of lemon-juice, may be added, should the 
flavour require heightening. Fine bread sauce, and plain gravy 
should likewise be served with it. Some persons still prefer the old- 
fiuliioned currant sauce to any other : ana many have the brains and 
staffing stirred into rich melted butter, instead of gravy ; but the 
receipt which we have ^ven has usually been so much approved, 
that we can recommend it with some confidence, as it stands. Modem 
taste would perhaps be rather in favour of rich brown gravy and 
thick tomata sauce, or sauce poivrade. 

• A deep oblong dish of suitable size seems better adapted to this purpose.

require no basting, nor fuither attention of any kind, and will be well

When the shoulders of a cold roast pig are left entire, take them 
off with care, remove the skin, trim them into good form, dip them 
into clarified butter or very pure salad oil, then into fine crumbs 
highly seasoned with cayenne and mixed with about a half-teaspoonful 
of salt Broil them over a clear brisk fire, and send tiiem quiddy to 
table, as soon as they are heated through and equally browned, with 
tomata sauce, or sauce Robert, Curried crumbs and a currie-sauoe 
will give an excellent variety of this dish ; and savoury herbs with 
two or three eschalots chopped small together, and mixed with the 
bread-crumbs, and brown eschalot sauce to accompany the broil, will 
likewise be an acceptable one to many tastes.

the fire for three or four minutes, then stir to them a dessertspoonful 
of flour and continue to shake or toss them gently, but do not allow 
them to brown. Add a small bunch of parsley, a bay-lea^ a 
middling-sized blade of mace, some salt, a small quantity of cayenne

to three glasses of light white wine. Let these boil gently until

TO BOAST PORK. 

When the skin is left on the joint which is to be roasted, it must 
be scored in narrow strips of equal width, before it is put to the fire, 
and laid at a considerable distance from it at first, that the meat may 
be heated through before the skin hardens or begins to brown ; it 
must never stand still for an instant, and the iMisting should be 
constant. Fork is not at the present day much served at very good 
tables, particularly in this form ; and it is so still less with the old 
savoury stuffing of sage and onions, though some eaters like it 
always with the leg: when it is ordered for this joint, therefore, 
prepare it as directed for a goose, at page 160, and after having 
loosened the skin from the knuckle, insert as much as can well be 
secured in it A little clarified butter or salad oil may be brushed 
over the skin quite at first, particularly should the meat not be very 
fat, but unless remarkably lean, it will speedily yield sufficient drip- 
ping to baste it with. Joints from which the fat has been par^ 
will require of course far less roasting than those on which the 
crackling is retained. Brown ffravy, and apple or tomata sauce, are 
the usual accompaniments to all roasts of porlc except a sucking pig 
ther should alwavs be thoroughly cooked. 

Leg of pork of 8 lbs., 3 hours ; loin of from 5 to 6 lbs., with the 
«kiii on, 2 to 2i hours ; spare rib of 6 to 7 lbs., 1| hour. 

TO ROAST A SADDLE OF PORK. 

The skin of this joint may be removed entirely, but if left on it 
must be scored lengthwise, or in the direction in which it will be 
carved. The pork should be young, of fine quality, and of moderate 
size. Boast it very carefully, either by the directions given in the 
precedimr receipt, or when the skin is taken off, by those for a 
saddle of mutton, allowing in the latter case from three quarters of 
an hour to a full hour more of the fire for it in proportion to its 
weight. Serve it with ffood brown gravy and tomata sauce, or 
sauce Robert ; or with apple sauce should it be preferred.

cobbett's receipt for curinq bacon. 

" All other parts being taken away, the two sides tliat remain, and 
which are csHlGd flitches, are to be cured for bacon. They are fintt 
rubbed with salt on their inside, or flesh sides, then placed one on 
the other, the flesh sides uppermost in a salting trough, which has a 
gutter round its edges to drain away the brine ; for to have sweet 
and fine bacon, the flitches must not be sopping in brine, which gives 
it the sort of taste that barrel-pork and sea-junk have, and than 
which is nothing more villanous. Everyone knows how different 
is the taste of fresh dry salt from that of salt in a dissolved state. 
Therefore, cliange the salt often ; once in four or five days. Let it 
melt and sink in, but let it not lie too long. Change the flitehes, 
put that at the bottom which was first on the top. Do this a 
couple of times. This mode will cost you a great deal more in salt 
than the sopping mode; but vrithout it your bacon will not be bo 
sweet and fine, nor keep so well. As to the time required for 
making the flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on circumstances; 
the thickness of the flitch, the state of the weather, the place 
wherein the salting is going on. It takes a longer time for a thick 
than for a thin flitch ; it takes longer in dry than in damp weather, 
it tidces longer in a dry than in a damp place. But for the flitches of 
a hog of five score, in weather not very dry or verj damp, about six 
weel^ may do; and as yours is to be faty which receives little 
injury from over-salting, give time enough ; for you are to have 
bacon till Christmas comes again. The place for salting should, 
like a dairy, always be cool, but always admit of a free circulation of 
air; confined air, though cool, will taint meat sooner than the mid- 
day sun accompanied vrith a breeze. With regard to smoking the 
bacon, two precautions are necessary: first to hang the flitches 
where no ram comes down upon them, and next, that the smoke 
must proceed from wood, not peat, turf, nor coal. As to the time 
that it requires to smoke a flitch, it must depend a ^ood deal upon 
whether there be a constant fire beneath, and whetner the fire be 
large or small. A month will do if the fire be pretty constant, and 
such as a farm house fire usually is. But oversmoKing, or rather, 
too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon rust. Great attention 
should, therefore, be paid to this matter. The flitch ought not to be 
dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it ought to be perfectly 
dry. llefore you hang it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh-skle 
pretty thickly over with bran or vrith some fine .saw-dust, not of deal 
or fir. Hub it on the flesh, or pat it well down upon it This 

• If broiled, with the addition of these a little darifled butter most be added

keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings, and makes a 
sort of crust to be dried on. 

^* To keep the bacon sweet and good, and free from hoppers, sift 
fine some clean and dry toood'oshes. Put some at the bottom of a 
box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon. Lay in one 
flitch ; and then put in more ashes, then another flitch, and cover this 
with six or eight inches of the ashes. The place where the box 
or chest is kept ought to be drt/y and should the ashes become damp 
they should be put in the fire-place to dry, and when cold, put 
back again. Witn these precautions the bacon will be as good at the 
end of the year as on the first day.** 

Obs. — ^Although the preceding directions for curing the bacon are 
a little yague as regards the proportions of salt and pork, we think 
those for its after-management will be acceptable to many of our 
readers, as in our damp dimate it is often a matter of great difficulty 
to preserve hams and bacon through the year from rust. 

A GENUINE YORKflHIUB EECEIPT FOR CURING HAMS AND 
BACON. 

•* Let the swine be put up to fast for twenty-four hours before 
*hey are killed (and observe that neither a time of severe frost, nor 
very damp weather, is favourable for curing bacon). After a pig has 
been killed and scalded, let it hang twelve hours before it is cut up, 
then for every stone or fourteen pounds* weight of the meat, take 
one pound of salt, an ounce and a quarter of saltpetre, and half an 
ounce of coarse sugar. Rub the sugar and saltpetre first into the 
fleshy parts of the pork, and remove carefully with a fork any 
€xtravasated blood that may appear on it, together with the broken 
vessels adjoining; apply the salt especially to those parts, as well as 
to the shank-ends of the hams, and any other portions of the flesh 
that are more particularly exposed. Before the salt is added to the 
meat, warm it a little bemre the fire, and use only a part of it in the 
first instance ; then, as it dissolves, or is absorbed by the meat, add 
the remainder at several difierent times. Let the meat in the mean 
while lie either on clean straw, or on a cold brick or stone floor : it 
will require from a fortnight to three weeks* curing, according to the 
state of^the atmosphere. When done, hang it in a cool dry place, 
where there is a thorough current of air, and let it remain there 
untO it is perfectly dry, when the salt will be found to have 
crystallized upon the surface. The meat may then be removed to 
your store, and kept in a dose chest, surroimded with clean outer 
straw. If very large, the hams will not be in perfection in less than 
twelve months from the time of their being stored.*'

KENTISH MODE OF CUTTING UP AND CURING A PIG. 

To a porker of sixteen stone Kentish weight (that is to say, eight 
pounds to the stone, or nine stone two pounds of conunon weight), 
allow two gallons of salt, two pounds of saltpetre, one pound oi 
coarse sugar, and two pounds of oay-salt well dried and reduced to 
powder. Put aside the hams and cheeks to he cured hy themsel ; 
let the feet, ears, tail, and eye-parts of the head be salted • r 
immediate eating; the blade-bones, and ends of the loins and ribs 
reserved for sausage-meat should it be wanted, and the loin and 
spare-ribs for roasting. Divide and salt the remainder thus: Mix 
well together the saltpetre, sugar, and bay-salt, and rub the pork 
gently with them in every part ; cover the bottom of the pickling 
tub with salt, and jMck in the pork as closely as possible, with a 
portion of the remaining salt between each layer. A very little 
water is sometimes sprinkled in to facilitate the dissolving of the salt 
into a brine, but this is always better avoided, and in dfunp weather 
will not be needed. Kin a £>rtnight it should not have risen, so as 
almost entirely to cover the meat, boil a strong brine of salt, salt- 
petre, sugar, and bay-salt; let it remain until perfectly cold, and 
then ]^ur it over the pork. A board, with a heavy stone weight 
ujx)n it, should be kept upon the meat to force it down under the 
brine. In from three to four months it will be fit for table, and will 
be delicate and excellent pickled pork.

or nine stone two pounds of common weight, or fourteen pounds to

FRENCH BACON FOR LARDING. 

Cut the bacon from the pig with as little lean to it as possible. 
Rub it well in every part with salt which has been dried, reduced to 
powder, and sifted ; put the layers of bacon close against and upon 
each other, in a shallow wooden trough, and set in a cool, but not a 
damp cellar ; add more salt all round the' bacon, and lay a board, 
with a very heavy weight upon it. Let it remain for six weeks, dien 
hang it up in a dry and airy place. 

Fork, 14 lbs. ; adt, 14 oz. : 6 weeks. 

TO PICKLE CH£EE:S OF BACON AND HAMS. 

One pound of common salt, one pound of the coarsest sugar, and 
one ounce of saltpetre, in fine powder, to each stone (fourteen 
pounds) of the meat will answer this purpose extremely well. An 
ounce of black pepper can be added, if^ liked, and when less sugar is 
preferred, the proportion can be diminished one half, and the quaU'

and all applied at the same time.

aiONSIBUB UDS'S RECEIPT, HAMS SUPERIOR TO WESTPHALIA. 

(JExceUeni.') 

** Take the hams as soon as the pig is sufficiently cold to be cut 
up, rub them well with common salt, and leave them for three days 
to drain ; throw away the biine, . and for a couple of hams of from 
fifteen to eighteen pounds weight, mix together two ounces of 
saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, and a pouna of common salt ; rub 
the hams in every part with these, lay them into deep pickling- 
pans with the rind downwards, and keep them for three days well 
covered with the salt and sugar; then pour over them a bottle of 
good vinegar, and turn them in the brine, and baste them with it 
daily for a month ; drain them well, rub them with bran, and let 
them be hung for a month high in a chimney over a wood-fire to 
be smoked.** 

Hams, of from 15 to 18 lbs. each, 2; to drain 3 days. Common 
salt, and coarse sugar, each 1 lb. ; saltpetre, 2 oz. * 3 days. Vinegar,. 
1 bottle : 1 month. To be smoked 1 month. 

Obs. — Such of our readers as shall make trial of this admirable 
receipt, will acknowledge, we doubt not, that the hams thus cured 
are in reality superior to those of Westphalia. It was originnlly 

S'ven to the public by the celebrated French cook. Monsieur Ude. 
e directs that the hams when smoked should be hung as high as 
possible from the fire, that the fat may not be melted; a veiy 
necessary precaution, as the mode of their being cured renders it 
peculiarly liable to do so. This, indeed, is somewhat perceptible in 
the cookmg, which ought, therefore, to be conducted with especial 
care. The hams should be very softly simmered,* and not over- 
done. They should be large, and of finely-fed pork, or the receipt 
will not answer. We give the result of our first trial of it, which 
was perfectly successful, the ham cured by it being of the finest 
possible flavour.

SUPER-EXCELLENT BACON. 

For seyeral successive years, after first testing the above receipt, 
we had it adopted for curing bacon, with even more highly satis- 
factory results, as it was of incomparable flavour, and remained ffood 
for a great length of time, the vmesar preserving it entirely from 
becommg rusted. Well-fed pork of delicate size was always used for 
it, and excellent vinegar. The ingredients were added in the pro- 
portions given in the receipt for the Suffolk ham whidi preceeds this, 
and the same time was allowed for the salting and smokmg 

HAMS. 

{Bordyhe Receipt.) 

After the hams have been rubbed with salt, and well drained 
from the brine, according to our previous directions, take, for each 
fourteen pounds weight of the pork, one ounce of saltpetre in fine 
powder mixed with three ounces of very brown sugar; rub the 
meat in every part with these, and let it remain some hours, then 
cover it well with eight ounces of bay-salt, dried and pounded, and 
mixed with four ounces of common salt : in four davs add one pound 
of treacle, and keep the hams turned daily, and well basted with the 
pickle for a month. Hang them up to drain for a night, fold them 
m brown paper, and send them to be smoked for a month. An 
ounce of ground black pepper is often mixed with the saltpetre in 
this receipt, and three ounces of bruised juniper- berries are rubbed 
oh to the meat before the salt is added, when hams of a very high 
flavour are desired. 

Ham, 14 lbs. ; saltpetre, 1 oz. ; coarse sugar, 3 oz. : 8 to 12 hours

TO BOIL A HAH. 

The degree of soaking which must be given to a ham before it is 
boiled, must depend both on the manner in which it has been cured, 
and on its age. If highly salted, hard, and old, a dav and night, or 
even longer, may be requisite to dilate the pores sufficiently, and to 
extract a portion of the salt. To do either effectually the water 
must be several times changed during the steeping We genenillv 
find hams cured by any of the receipts which we have given in this 
chapter quite enough soaked in twelve hours; and they are more 
frequently laid into water only early in the morning of the day on 
which they are boiled. Those pickled by Monsieur Ude's receipt 
need much less steeping than any others. After the ham has beea 



CHAP, xm.] PORK. 257 

scraped, or brushed, as clean as possible, pare away lightly anv part 
which, firom being blacJcened cr rusty, would dimgnre it; though 
it is better not to cut the flesh at all unless it be really requisite lor 
the good appearance of the joint. Lay it into a ham-kettle, or into 
any other vessel of a similar form, and cover it plentifully with cold 
water ; bring it very slowly to boU, and clear on carefully the scum 
which will 1^ thrown up in great abundance. So soon as the water 
has been cleared from this, cSaw back the pan quite to the edge of 
the stove, that the ham may be simmered softly out steadily, until it 
is tender. On no account allow it to boil fast. A bunch of herbs 
and three or four carrots, thrown in directly ailer the water has 
been skimmed, will improve it When it can be probed very 
easily with a sharp skewer, or larding-pin, lift it out, strip off the 
skin, and should there be an oven at hand, set it in for a few 
minutes after having laid it on a drainer ; strew fine raspings over 
it, or grate a hard-toasted crust, or sift upon it the prefMured bread 
of Chapter Y., unless it is to be glazed, wnen neither of these must 
be used. 

Small ham, 3) to 4 hours ; moderate sized, 4 to 4} hours ; very 
large, 5 to 5} hours. 

Ohs. — We have seen the following manner of boiling a ham 
recommended, but we have not tried it : — *' Put into the water in 
which it is to be boiled, a quart of old cider and a pint of vinegar, 
a large bunch of sweet herbs, and a bay leaf. When it is two- thirds 
done, skin, cover it with raspings, and set it in an oven imtil it is 
done enough : it will prove incomparably superior to a ham boiled in 
the usual way.** 

TO QABNISH AND ORNAMENT HAMS IN YARIOUS WAYS. 

When a ham has been carefully and delicately boiled, the rind 
while it is still warm, may be carved in various fanciful shapes to 
decorate it ; and a portion of it left round the knuckle in a semi- 
circular form of four or five inches deep, may at all times be easily 
8Collop]ped at the edge or cut into points {wmdykes). This, while 
preserving a character of complete simplicity for the dish, will eive it 
an air of neatness and finish at a slight cost of time and trouble. A 
paper frill should be placed round the bone. 

The Germans cut the ham-rind after it has been stripped from the 
joint, into small leaves and similar " prettinesses,** * and arrange them 
in a garland, or other approved device, upon its suiface. In Ireland 
and elsewhere, bread evenly sliced, and stamped out with cutters 
mach smaller than a fourpenny-piece, then carefully fried or 
coloured in the oven, is used to form designs upon hams after they 
are glazed. Lar^e dice of clear firm savoury jelly form their most 
eppropriate garnish, because they are intended to be eaten toith thetn,

The ham shown in Plate Y., which follows the directions for 
*» Carving,** is of yery good appearance ; but in common KngliRh 
Mtchens generally, eren the degree of artistic skill required to n>rm 
its decorations well, is not often to be met with. 

FRENCH RBCEIFT FOB BOILXNG A HAM. 

After having soaked, thoroughly cleaned, and trimmed the ham, 
put over it a little very sweet clean hay, and tie it up in a thin 
cloth ; place it in a ham Kettle, a braiang jnn, or any other vessel as 
nearly of its size as can be, and cover it with two parts of cold vrater 
and one of light white wine (we think the reader will perhaps find 
cider a good substitute for this) ; add, when it boils and has heea 
skimmeC four or five cairots, two or three onions, a large bunch of 
savoury herbs, and the smallest bit of garlic Let the whole sui- 
mer eently from four to five hours, or longer should the ham be 
veiy large. When perfectly tender, lift it out, take off the nnd, and 
sprmkle over it some fine crumbs, or some raspings of bread mixed 
with a little finely minced parsley. 

Obi. — Foreign cooks generally leaye hams, braised joints, and 
various other prepared meats intended to be served cold, to cool 
down partially in the liquor in whioh they are cooked; and this 
renders them more succulent; but for snuiU Irugal £BuniIies the 
plan does not altogether answer, because the moisture of the sur&ee 
(which would evaporate quickly if they were taken out ouite hot) 
prevents their keeping well for any length of time. The samo 
objection exists to serving hams laid upon, or closely garnished with 
savoury jeUy (aspic)^ wnich becomes much more quiddy unfit for 
table than the hams themselves. 

These considerations, which may appear insignificant to some of 
our readers, will have weight with those who are compelled to 
r^;ulate their expenses with economy. 

TO BAKE A HAM. 

Unless when too salt firom not being sufficiently soaked, a ham 
(particularly a young and Iresh one) eats much better baked than 
boiled, and remains longer good. The safer plan to ensure its bemg 
sufficiently steeped, is to la^ it into plenty of cold water over night. 
The following day soak it for an hour or more in warm water, waah. 
it delicately dean, trim smoothly off all rusty parts, and lay it with 
the rind downwards into a laige common pie-dish; press an oiled 
paper closely over it, and then fasten secmnely to the edge of the 
disn a thick cover of coarse paste; and send the ham to a moderate 
oven, of which the heat will be well sustained until it is baked. Or, 
when more convenient, lay the ham at once— rind downwaida«HNa

the paste, of which sufficient should he made, and rolled off to an 
inch in ^ckness, to completely envelope it Press a sheet of oiled 
^Mlscap paper upon it ; gather up the paste firmly all round, draw 
and pinch tne ed^s togewer, and fold them over on the upper side 
of the ham, taking care to dose them so that no grayy can escape 
Send it to a well-heated, hut not a fierce oven. A very small ham 
will require quite three hours baking, and a large one five. The 
erust and the skin must be remoyed while it is hot When part 
only of a ham is dressed, this mode is better fiur than bdling it. 

TO BOIL BACON. 

When yery highly salted and dried, it should be soaked for an 
hour before it is dressed. Scrape and wash it well, coyer it plen- 
tifully with cold water, let it both heat and boil slowly, remoye all 
the scum with care, and when a fork or skewer will penetrate the 
bacon eaalj lift it out, strip off the skin, and strew raspings of bread 
oyer the top, or grate upon it a hard crust which has b^n toasted 
until it is crisp quite through ; or should it be at hand, use for the 
purpose the bread recommended at page 103, then diy it a little 
oefore the fire, or set it for a few minutes into a gentle oyen. Bacon 
requires long boiling, but the precise time depends upon its quality, 
the flesh of young porkers becoming tender much sooner than that of 
older ones; sometimes too, the manner in which the animal has been 
i^ renders the meat hard, and it will then, unless thoroughly cooked, 
proye very indigestible. From ten to fifteen minutes less for the 
pound, must be allowed for unsmoked bacon, or for pickled pork. 

Smoked bacon (striped), 2 lbs., from li to 1} hour ; unsmoked 
bacon or pork, 1 to li hour. 

Obi. — ^The thickest part of a large side or flitch of bacon will 
req uire from twenty to tnirty minutes longer boiling than the thinner 
aide. 

BAOON BROILBD Oil FRIED. 

Cut it eyenly in thin slices or rashers^ as they are generally called, 
pare from them all rind and rust, curl Ihem round, fisten them with 
small slight skewers, then fry, broil, or toast them in a Dutch oyen ; 
draw out the skewers before they are sent to table. A few minutes 
will dress them either vray. They may also be cooked without being 
curled. The rind should always be taken off, and the bacon gently 
toasted, grilled, or fried, that it may be well done without h&ng too 
much dried or hardened : it should be cut thin, 

DRESSED BASHERS OF BACON.

The bacon thus dressed is much more delicate than when broiled or 
firied without the previous boiling. 
4 to 5 minutes. 

TONBRIDGE BRAWN. 

Split open the head of a pig of middling size, remove the brain 
and all the bones, strew the mside rather thickly with fine salt, and 
let it drain until the following day. Cleanse the ears and feet in the 
same manner : wipe them all from the brine, lay them into a large 
pan, and rub them well with an ounce and a half of saltpetre rriixed 
with six ounces of sugar ; in twelve hours, add six ounces of salt ; 
the next day pour a quarter of a pint of good vinegar over them, and 
keep them turned in the pickle every twenty-four hours for a 
week ; then wash it off the ears and feet, and boil them for about an 
hour and a half; bone the feet while they are warm, and trim the 
gristle fh>m the large ends of the ears. When these are ready, mix 
a large grated nutmeg with a teaspoonM and a half of maoe, half a 
teaspoomnl of cayenne, and as much of cloves. Wash, but do not 
soak the head; wipe and flatten it on a board ; cut some of the flesh 
from the thickest parts, and ^when the whole of the meat has been 
seasoned equally with the spices) lay it on the thinnest; intermix it 
with that of the ears and feet, roll it up very tight, and bind it firmly 
with broad tape ; fold a thin pudding-cloth quite closely round it, 
and tie it securely at both ends. A braising-pan, from its form, is 
best adapted for boiling it, but if there be not one at hand, place the 
head in a vessel adaptal to its size, with the bones and trimnungs of 
the feet and ears, a laive bunch of savoury herbs, two moderate-sized 
onions, a small head of celery, three or four carrots, a teaspoonfnl of 
peppercorns, and sufficient cold water to cover it well ; boil it very 
^Dtlv for four hours, and leave it until two parts cold in the liquor 
m which it was boiled. Take off the cloth, and put the brawn 
between two dishes or trenchers, with a heavy weight on the upper 
one. The next dav take off the fillets of tape, and serve the head 
whole or sliced with the brawn sauce of Chapter YL

eschalots can be mixed with the meat for those who like their 
flavour. 

SAUSAGES. 

Common farm-house sausages are made with nearly equal parts of 
fat and lean pork, coarsely chopped, and seasoned with salt and 
pepper only. They are put into skins (which have previously been 
turned inside out, scraped very thin, washed with extreme nicefy, and 
wiped very dry), then twisted into links, and should be hung in a cool 
airy larder, when they will remain good for some time. Odd scraps 
and trimmings of pork are usually taken for sausage-meat when the 
pig is killed and cut up at home ; but the chine and blade-bone are 
preferred in general for the purpose. The pork rinds, as we have 
already stated,* will make a strong and almost flavourless jelly, 
which may be used with excellent effect for stock, and which, with the 
addition of some pork-bones^ plenty of vegetables, and some dried 
peas, will make a very nutritious soup for those who do not object to 
the pork-flavour which the bones will give. Half an ounce of salt, 
and nearly or quite a ouarter of an ounce of pepper wiU sufficiently 
leason each pound of tne saussge-meat 

KENTISH SAUSAGE-MEAT. 

To three pounds of lean pork, add two of fat, and let both be 
taken clear of skin. As sausages are lighter, though not so delicate, 
when the meat is somewhat coarsely chopped, this difference should 
be attended to in making them. When the fkt and lean are partially 
mixed, strew over them two oimces and a half of dry salt, beaten to 
powder, and mixed with one ounce of ground black pepper, and three 
urge tablespoonsful of sage, very finely minced. Turn the meat with 
the chopping-knife, until the ingredients are well blended. Test it 
before it is iSken off the block, by fr3ring a small portion, that if more 
seasoning be desired, it may at once be added. A fUll-sized nutmeg,

which, after heing well floured, are roasted in a JDutch oven. They 
must be watched, and often turned, that no port may be scorched. 
The meat may also be put into skins, and dressed in any other way.

CHAPTER XIV. 




TO CHOOSE POULTRY. 

Youno, pltunp, -well-fed, but not over-fatted poultxy Is the best- 
The skin of fowls and turkeys should be clear, white, and finely 
grained, the breasts broad and full-fleshed, the legs smooth, the toei 
pliable and easily broken when bent back ; the bunls should also be 
heavy in proportion to their size. This applies equally to geese and 
ducks, of which the breasts likewise shomd be very plum^, and the 
feet yellow and flexible : when these are red and hard, the bills of the 
same colour, and the skin full of hairs, and extremely coarse, the 
birds are old. 

White-legged fowls and chickens should be chosen for boiHpg, 
because theur appearance is the most delicate when dressed ; but the 
dark-legged ones often prove more juicy and of better flavour when 
roasted, and their colour then is immaterial. 

Every precaution should be taken to prevent poultry from be- 
coming ever so slightly tainted before it is cooked, but unless thm 
weather be exceedingly sultry, it should not be quite freshly killed* 



CHAP- HV.] POULTRY. 265 

pigeons only are the better for being bo, and are thought to lose their 
flATOur by hanging even a day or two. Turkeys, as -we have stated 
in our receipts for them, are yery tough and poor eating if not suf- 
fidentljr long kept. A goose, also, in winter, should hang some days 
before it is dressed, and fowls, likewise, vrill be improyed by it. 

AU kinds of poultry should be thoroughly cooked^ thoueb without 
being oyerdone, for nothing in general can more effectually destroy 
the appetite than the taste and appearance of their flesh when brought 
to table half roasted or boiled 

TO BONE A FOWL OR TURKEY "WITHOUT OPENING IT. 

After the fowl has been drawn and singed, wipe it inside and out 
with a clean cloth, but do not wash it. Take off the head, cut 
through the skin all round the first joint of the legs, and pull them 
from the fowl, to draw out the large tendons. Baise the flesh first 
from the lower part of the back-bone, and a little also from the end 
of the breast-bone, if necessary ; work the knife gradually to the 
socket of the thigh ; with the point of the knife detauch the joint from 
it, take the end of the bone firaily in the fineers, and cut the flesh 
dean from it down to the next ioint, round which pass the point of 
the knife carefully, and when the skin is loosened from it in every 
part, cut round the next bone, keeping the edge of the knife close to 
It, until the whole of the leg is done. Remove the bones of the other 
leg in the same manner ; then detach the flesh from the back and 
breast-bone sufficiently to enable you to reach the upper joints of the 
wings ; proceed with Uiese as with the legs, but be especially cardiil 
not to pierce the skin of the second joint . it is usual to leave the 
pinions imboned, in order togive more easily its natural form to the 
fowl when it is dressed. The merrythought and neck-bones may 
now easily be cut away, the back and side-bones taken out without 
bein^ divided, and the breast-bone separated carefully from the flesh 
(which, as the work progresses, must be turned back from the bones 
upon the fowl, until it is completely inside out). After the one re- 
maining bone is removed, draw the wings and legs back to their pro- 
per form, and turn the fowl right side outwards. 

A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner, but as it requires a 
yery large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely, the legs and 
wings are sometimes drawn into the body, to diminish the expense of 
this. If very securely trussed, and sewn, the bird may be either 
b(^ed, or stewed in rich gravy, as well as roasted, after being boned 
and forced ; but it must be most gently cooled, or it may burst. 

ANOTHER HODB OP BONING A FOWL OR TURKEY. 

Cut throiu^h the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the 
flesh carefulfy on either side with the point of a sharp knife, until the 
sockets of the wings and thighs are reached. Till a uttle practice has 



266 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. xi/. 

been gained, it will perhaps be better to bone these joints before nro- 
oeeding fturther ; but after they are onoe detached from it, the wliole 
of the body may easily be separated from the flesh and taken oat 
entire : only the neck-bones and merrythought will then remain to 
be remoyed. The bird thus prepared may either be restored to its 
original form, by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the 
body with the liyers of two or three fowls mixed with alternate layen 
of parboiled tongue freed from the rind, fine sausaoe meat, or yeal 
forcemeat, or thm slices of the nicest bacon, or aught else of good 
flayour, which will giye a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is 
caryed ; and then be sewn up and trussed as usual ; or the legs and 
wings may be drawn inside the body, and the bird being first flattened

fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding-doui, closely tied at 
both ends, and dressed as follows :— Put it into a braisingpan, stewpan, 
or thidc iron saucepan, bright in the inside, and fitted as nearly as 
may be to its size ; add all the chicken bones, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
two carrots, two bay-leayes, a large blade of mace, twenty-four white 
peppercorns, and any trimmings or bones of undressed yeal which 
may be at hand ; coyer the whole with sood yeal-broth, add salt, if 
needed, and stew it yery softly, from an hour and a quarter to an 
hour and a half; let it cool in the liquor in which it was stewed ; and 
after it is lifted out, boil down the ffrayy to a jell3r and strain it ; let 
it become cold, clear off the fat, and senre it cut into huve dice or 
Toughed, and laid round the fowl, which is to be seryed cold. If 
restored to its form, instead of being rolled, it must be stewed gently 
for an hour, and may then be sent to table hot, coyered with mush- 
room, or any other good sauce that may be preferred ; or it may be 
left until the following day, and seryed garnished with the jelly, 
which should be firm, and yeiy clear and well-flayoured ; the liquor 
in which a calTs foot has been boiled down, added to the broth, 
will giye it the necessary degree of consistence. French cooks add 
three or four onions to these preparations of poultry (the last of 
which is called a galantine) ; but these our own taste would lead us to 
reject.

TO BOAST A TURKEY. 

InYery cold weather a turkey 
in its feathers will hang (in an airy 
larder) quite a fortnight with ad- 
Tantage ; and, however fine a ^. 
quali^ of bird it may be, unless^ 
sufficiently Ions ke])t, it will prove 
not worth the dressing, though it 
should always be perfecdy sweet 
when prepwred for table. Pluck, Turkey for roasting. 

draw, and singe it with exceeding care; wash, and then dry it tho- 
roughly with clean cloths, or merely wipe the outside well, without 
werang it, and pour water plentifully tnrough the inside. Fill the 
breast with forcemeat (No. 1, Chapter YIU.)) or with the finest 
sausage meat, luffhly seasoned with minced herbs, lemon-rind, mace,, 
and cayenne. Truss the bird firmly, lay it to a clear sound fire, 
baste it constantly and bountifully with butter, and serve it when 
done with good brown gravy, and well-made bread sauce. An entire 
chain of delicate fried sausages is stiU often placed in the dish, 
Tound a turkey, as a garnish. 

It is usual to fold and fasten a sheet of buttered writing paper over 
the breast to prevent its being too much coloured : this i^ould be 
removed twenty minutes b efore the bird is done. The forcemeat of 
chestnuts (No. 15, Chapter VJJi.) may be veiy advantageously sub- 
stituted for the commoner kinds in stumnc it, and the body may then 
be filled with chestnuts, previously stewed until tender in rich gravy, 
or simmered over a slow fire in plenty of rasped bacon, with a high 
seasoning of mace, nutmeg, and cayenne, until they are so ; or, inst^d 
of this, well-made chestnut sauce, or a ^sh of stewed chestnuts, may 
be sent to table with the turkey. 

Obe, 1. — ^BaronLiebig*s improved method of roasting will be found at 
p. 171, and can be followed uways instead of the directions given here. 

l\ to 2^ hours. 

Oht. 2. — A turkey should be laid at first far firom the fire, and 
drawn nearer when half done, though never sufficiently so to scorch 
it ; it should be well roasted, for even the most inveterate advocates- 
of under -dressed meat will seldom tolerate the taste or sight of 
partially-raw poultry 

TO BOIL A TURKST. 

A delicate but plump hen- 
turkey of moderate size should be 
selected for boiling. Free the skin 
most carefully from all the stumps, 
and draw the bird, using tne 
neatest precaution not to break 
die gall bladder; singe it with 
miting paper, take off the head Turkey fbrboiung.

and neck, ent through the skin round the first joint of the less, 
and draw them off: this is best accomplished by £uteninff m 
feet to a strong hook, and then pulling the bird away from it. Wash 
it ezce^ingly clean, and then 'vnpeit dry, fill the breast with the 
forcemeat No. 1 or 2 of Chapter vHI., or with the oyster, chestnut 
or French forcemeat, of which the receipts are given in the same 
chapter. In trussing it draw the 1^ mto the body, break the 
breast-bone, and give the turkey as round and plump an appearance 
as can be. Put it into plenty of warm water, or into as mudi 
boilinff water as will rise about an inch over it, and when it has 
quiteboiled for ten minutes, cool it down by the addition of cold 
water, and then take out a portion of it, leaving only as much as 
will keep the bird thoroughly covered until it is ready for table.* 
Clear ou the scum with the greatest care as it is thrown to the 
surface, and boil the bird very gently from an hour and a half to two 
hours and a quarter. A ver^ large turkey would require a longer 
time, but it is unsuited to this m^e of cooking. When the oyster- 
forcemeat is used, a large tureen of rich oyster sauce should accom- 
pany the dish ; but celery sauce, or sood white sauce, may otherwise 
be sent to table with it; and a boded tongue or a small ham is 
usually served in addition. For a plain family dinner, a delicate 
cheek of bacon is sometimes substituted for either of these, and 
parsley and butter for a more expensive sauce. Fast boiling will 
cause the skin of the bird to break, and must therefore be especially 
avoided: it should hang for some days before it is dressed, for if 
quite freshly killed it vrill not be tender, but it must be perfedfy 
sweet to be fit for table. Truss the turkey by the directions of 
introductory chapter on trussing. 

Moderate-sized turkey, H to 2 hours; large turkey, longer; yeiy 
nudl one, less time. 

TUBKET BONED AND FORCED. 
(An excellent disk.) 

Take a small, well-kept, but quite sweet hen-turkey, of from 
seven to eight pounds weight, and remove, by the receipt for a fowl 
(page 265), all the bones except those of the pinions, without opening 
the bird; draw it into shape, and fill it entirely with exceedingly 
fine sausage meat, begpning with the legs and wings; plump the 
breast well in prepanng it, and when its original form is quite 
restored, tie it securely at both ends, and at the extremities of the 
legs; pass a slight iron skewer through these and the body, and 
another through the wings and body; then lay a tmne over the 
back of the turkey, and pass it under the ends of the first skewer 
cross it in the centre of tiie back, and pass it under the ends of the

pecond skewer; then cany it over the pinions to keep them firmly 
in their place, and iasten it at the neck. When a cradle spit, of 
which the engraving below shows the form, and which opens with a 
joint to receive the roast, is not at hand, a bottle jack will be found more

convenient than any other for holding the turkey ; and afler the hook of 
this is passed through the neck, it must be further supported by a string 
running across the back and under the points of the skewer which 
confines the pinions to the hook ; for, otherwise, its weight would 
most probably cause it to fall. Flour it well, place it far from the 
fire until it is heated through, and baste it plentifully and incessantly 
with butter. An hoiu: and three quarters will roast it well. Break 
and boil down the bones for ffravy in a pint and a half of water, 
or good veal broth, with a little salt, a few slices of celery, a dozen 
corns of pepper, and a branch or two of parsley. Brown gently in a 
morsel of fresh butter, a couple of ounces of lean ham, add to them a 
slight dredging of flour, and a little cayenne, and pour to them the 
broth from the bones, after it has boiled for an hour, and been strained 
and skimmed ; shake the stewnan well round, and stew the gravy 
until it is wanted for table ; clear it entirely from &t, strain, and 
serve it very hot. An eschalot or half an onion may be browned 
with the ham when either is liked, but their flavour is not, we think, 
appropriate to poultry. 

The turkey may be partially filled with the forcemeat No 1 or 3 
of Chapter VJH., and the sausage-meat may then be placed on either 
side of it. 

Hen turkey between 7 and 8 lbs. weight, boned, filled ^th 
sausage-meat, 3 to 4 lbs. ; or with forcemeat No. 1 , or with No. 3, 
Chapter VI., 1 lb. (that is to say, 1 lb. of bread-crumbs, and the 
other ingredients in proportion.) Sausage-meat, 2 to 3 ll». roasted 
1| hour. 

Ohs. — When a common spit is used for the turkey, it must be 
fastened to, and not put upon it. 

Bread sauce can be served with the bird, or not, at pleasure. 

It will be found an improvement to moisten the sausage-meat with 
two or three spoonsful of water : it should be finely minced, well 
ipiced, and mixed with herbs, when the common forcemeat is not 
wd in addition. In preparing it a pound and a quarter of fat 
should be mized with each pound of the lean. 

To gi^ the turkey a very good appearance, the breast may b« 
larded bj the directions of page 181.

Prepare as for boiling a fine well-kept hen tnrkey; wipe the 
nside thoroughly with a dry doth, but do not wash it; throw in a 
litUe salt to <&aw out the blood, let it remain a couple of hours or 
more, then drain and wipe it again ; next, rub the outside in every 
part with about four ounces of fine dry salt, mixed with a large 
tablespoonftd of pounded sugar; rub the turkey well with these, 
and turn it every day for four days ; then fill it entirely with equal 
parts of choice sausage-meat, and of the crumb of bread soaked in 
boiling milk or cream, and wrung dry in a cloth ; season these with 
the grated rind of a large lemon and nutmeg, mace, cayenne, and 
fine herbs, in the same proportion as for veal forcemeat (Kb. 1, 
Chapter VIU). Sew the turkey up very securely, and whai 
truMcd, roll it in a doth, tie it closely at both end^ put it into 
boiling water, and boil it very gentlv between three and four hours. 
When taken up, sprinkle it thicldy with fine crumbs of bread, 
mixed with plenty of parsley, shred extremdy small. Serve it cold, 
with a sauce made of the strained juice and grated rind of two 
lemons, a teaspoonful of made mustand, and one of pounded sugar, 
with as much oil as will prevent its being more than pleasantly 
add, and a little salt, if needed; work these together until perfectly 
mixed, and send them to table in a tureen. 

This receipt was given to us abroad, by a Flemish lady, who had 
had the dish often served with great success in Paris. We have in- 
^rted it on her authority, not on our own experience ; but we think 
it may be quite dependea on.

sometimes arranged with the 1^ t?ngted back at the first joint, and 
the feet brought dose to the thiffhs in the same manner as those of •

require from an hour to an hour and a quarter*8 roasting. If fott

TO ROAST ▲ GOO0B. 

[In beat season from September to Msreh.] 

AAer it has been plncked and singed with care, put into the body 
of the goose two parboiled onions of 
moderate size finely chopped, and mixed 
with half an oimce of minced sage-leaves, 
a saltspoonful of salt, and half as much 
black pepper, or a proportionate quantity 
of cayenne ; to these add a small slice of ' 
fresh butter. Truss the goose, and after ^ ^ _^ 

it is on the spit, tie it finnly at both ends Goose for roasting. 

that it may turn steadily, and that the seasoning may not escape ; roast 
it at a brisk fire, and keep it constanj^ basted. Serve it wiUi brown 
gravy, and apple or tomata sauce. When the taste is in favour of a 
stronger seasoning than the above, which occurs we apprehend but 
seldom, use raw onions for it and increase the quantity ; but should one 
still mflder be preferred, mix a handful of fine bread-crumbs with the 
other ingredients, or two or three minced apples. The body of a goose is 
aometimes filled entirely with mashed potatoes, which, for this 
purpose, ought to be boiled very dry, and well blended with two or 
three ounces of butter, or with some thick cream^ some salt, and 
white pepper or cayenne : to these minced sage and parboiled onions 
. can al»> be added at pleasure. A teaspoonful of made-mustu^ half 
as much of salt, and a small portion of cayenne, smoothly mixed 
with a glass of port wine, are sometimes poured into the goose just 
before it is served, through a cut made in the apron. 
H to II hour.. 

ObM. — ^We extract, for the benefit of our readers, from a work in 
onr possession, the following passage, of which we have had no 
opportunity of testing the correctness. '' Geese, with sage and 
omons, may be depriv^ of power to breathe forth any incense, thus : 
Fare from a lemon all the yellow rind, taking care not to bruise the 
fruit nor to cut so deeply as to let out the juice. Place this lemon 
in the centre of the seasoning within the bird. When or before it is 
brought to table, let the flap be gentlv opened, remove the lemon 
with a tablespoon; avoid breaking, and kt it instantly be thrown 
away, as its white pithy skin will have absorbed aU the gross par- 
ticles which else would have escaped." 

TO ROAST A GREBN OOOBB. 

Season the inside with a little pepper and salt, and roast the goose 
at a brisk fire from forty to fifty minutes. Serve it with good brown 
gravy only. To this sorrel-sauce is sometimes added at not veiy 
mod^ English tables* Green geese are never stuffed.

TO BOAST A FOWL. 

[Fowls are alwayB in aeftson when they etn be procured raffidently young to 
be tender. About Febmary they become dear and scarce; and amaU spring 
ohiokena are generally Tuy ezpenslTe. As sommer advances they dedine in 
price.] 

Strip off the feathers, and care- 
fully pick every stomp firom the 
iskin, as nothing can be more un- 
I inyitii^ than the appearance of any 
kind of poultry where this has been 
neglected, nor more indicative of 
Fowl for roastiiig. slovenliness on the part of the 

cook. Take off the head and neck 
dose to the body, but leave sufficient of the skin to tie over the part 
that is cut. In drawing the bird, do not open it more than is needful^ 
and use great precaution to avoid breaking the gall-bladder. Hold the 
legs in boilinff water for two or three minutes that the skin mav be 
peeled from them easily ; cut the claws, and then, with a bit of lighted 
writing-paper, singe off the hairs without blackening the fowl. 
Wash, and wipe it afterwards very dry, and let the liver and gizzard 
be made delicately dean, and fastened into the pinions. Truss uid 
spit it firmly ; flour it well when first laid to the fire, basAe it fre- 
quently with butter, and when it is done draw out the skewers, dish 
it, pour a little good gravy over, and send it to table with bread» 
mushroom, egg, chestnut, or olive sauce. A common mode of serv- 
ing roast fowls in France is aux cressom^ that is, laid upon yoong 
water-cresses,* which have previously been freed from the onter 
leaves, thoroughly washed, shaken dry m a dean doth, and sprinkled 
with a little fine salt, and sometimes with a small quantity of 
vinegar : these should cover the dish, and after the fowls are placed 
on them, gravy should be poured 3ver as usual. 

The body of a fowl may be filled with very small mushrooms 
prepared as for partridges (see i»rtridges with mushrooms), then 
sewn up, roasted, and served with mushroom-sauce: this is an 
excellent mode of dressing it. A little rasped bacon, or a bit or 
two of the lean of beef or veal minced, or cut into dice, may be put 
inside the bird when either is considered an improvement ; but 
its own liver, or that of another fowl, will be found to impart a much. 
finer flavour than any of these last ; and so likewise will a teaspoonfiil 
of really good mushroom-powder smoothly mixed with a slice of good 
butter, and a seasoning of fine salt and cayenne-f 
Full-sized fowl, 1 hour : young chicken, 2^ to 35 minutes.

kut the vinegar is seldom added in this coontiy. 
f We cannot much recommend these mmn tuptrjluitim of the taU*. 



►. XIV.] POULTRY. 273 

Ohs, — As we have already observed in our general remarks on 
roosting, the time mnst be regulated by various drcumstancet 
which we named, and which the cook should always take into con- 
sideration. A buttered paper should be fastened over the breast, and 
removed about fifteen minutes before the fowl is served : this will 
prevent its taking too much colour. 

ROAfiT FOWL. 

(A French Receipt) 

Fill the breast of a fine fowl with good forcemeat, roast it as usual, 
and vrhen it is very nearly ready to serve take it from the fire, pour 
lukewarm butter over it m every part, and strew it thickly with very 
fine bread-crumbs; sprinkle these again with butter, and dip the 
fowl into more crumbs. Put it down to the fire, and when it is of a 
dear, fight brown all over, take it carefully from the spit, dish, and 
serve it with lemon-sauce, and with gravy thickened and mixed with 
plenty of minced parsley, or with brown gravy and any other sauce 
usually served with fowls Savoury herbs shred small, spice, and 
lemon-grate, may be mixed with the crumbs at pleasure. Do not 
pour gravy over the fowl when it is thus prepared. 

TO ROAST ▲ GUINEA FOWL. 

Let the bird hang for as man^ days as the weather will allow ; then 
stuff, truss, roast, and serve it like a turkey, or leave the head on and 
lard the breast Send gravy and bread-sauce to table with it in 
either case : it will be found excellent eating. 

I to 1 hour. 

FOWL A LA CARLSFORS. (eNTr£e.) 

Bone a fowl without opening the back, and restore it to its original 
form by filling the vacant spaces in the legs and wings with force- 
meat ; put a roU of it also mto the body, and a larse sausaee freed 
from the skin on either side ; tie it very securely at botii enos, truss 
It with fine skewers, and roast it for a full hour, keeping it basted 
plentifully with butter. When anpearance is not regarded, the 
pnions may be taken off, and the legs and wings drawn inside the 
IdwI, which will then require a much smaller proportion of force- 
meat : — ^that directed for veal vdll answer quite well in a seneral 
wty, but for a dinner of ceremonv. No. 17 or 18 of the same Copter, 
should be used in preference. The fowl must be tied securely to the 
vnt, sot put upon it. Boned chickens are excellent when entirely 
DUed with well-made mushroom forcemeat, or very delicate and 
nicely seasoned sausage-meat, and either roasted or stewed. Brown 
iravy, or mushroom sauce should then be sent to table with them.

raised from three birds, which wilfgiye but six cutlets, take the strips 
of flesh that lie under the wings, and that of the menythoughts, and

pounded mace. Dissolve as much ffood butter as will be required to 
dress them, and fry them in it of a light amber-colour : arrange them 
upon the sippets of bread, pile them high in the dish, and pour a rich 
brown gravy or Espagnole round, but not over them. 

FRIED CHICKEN A LA MALABAR. (ENTRis.) 

This is an Indian dish. Cut up the chicken, wipe it dry, and rub 
it well with currie-powder mixed with a little salt ; fry it in a bit of 
butter, taking care that it is of a nice light brown. In the mean time 
cut two or three onions into thin dices, draw them out into rings, and 
cut the rings into little bits about half an inch long ; fry them for a 
long time gently in a little darified butter, until they have gradually 
dried up and are of a delicate yellow-brown. Be careful that they 
are not burnt, as the burnt taste of a single bit would spoil the flavour 
of the whole. When they are as dry as chips, without the least 
grease or moisture upon them, mix a little salt with them, strew them 
over the fried chicken, and serve up with lemon on a plate. 

We have extracted this recdpt from a clever little work called the 
" Hand-Book of Cookery." 

HASHED FOWL. (eNTREE.)

will suffice for a dish, bruise the bodies with a paste roller, pour to 
them a pint of water, and boil them for an hour and a half to ti?o

hoars, with the addition of a little pepper and salt onl^, cr with a 
small quantity of onion, carrot, and sayoury herbs. Strain, and skim 
the fat from the gravy, put it into a clean saucepan, and, should it 
require thickening, stir to it, when it boils, half a teaspoonful of flour 
smoothly mixed with a small bit of butter ; add a httle mushroom 
catsup) or other store-sauce, with a slight seasoning of mace or nut- 
m^. Lay in the fowl, and keep it near the fire until it is heated 
q|iiite through, and is at the nomt of boiling : serve it with fried 
sippets round the dish. For a nash of higher relish, add to the bones 
Wnen they are first stewed dovm a large onion minced and browned 
in butter, and before the fowl is dished, add some cayenne and the 
juice of half a lemon. 

PBENCH AND OTHER RECEIPTS FOR MINCED FOWL. (ENTniE.) 

Buse from the bones all the more delicate parts of the flesh of 
either cold roast, or of cold boiled fowls, clear it from the skin, and 
keep it covered from the air until it is wanted for use. Boil the 
hones well bruised, and the skin, vnth three quarters of a pint of 
water until reduced quite half; then strain the gravy and let it cool ; 
next, having first skunmed off the fat, put it into a clean saucepan, 
with a quarter of a pint of cream, an ounce and a half of butter well 
mixed with a dessertspoonful of flour, and a little pounded mace, and 
erated lemon-rind ; keep these stirred until they boil, then put in the 
fowl, finely minced, with three or four hard-boiled eggs chopped 
small, and sufficient salt, and white pepper or cayenne, to season it 
properly. Shake the mince over the fire until it is just ready to 
hoil, stir to it quickly a squeeze of lemon-juice, dish it with pale 
sippets of fried bread, and serve it immediately. When cream cannot 
easily be obtained, use milk, with a double quantity of butter and 
flour. To make an English mince, omit the hard eggs, heat the fowl 
in the preceding sauce or in a common bScJuxmel^ or white sauce, cUdi 
it with small delicately poached ^gs (those of the guinea-fowl or 
bantam for example), laid over it in a circle, and send it quickly to 
table. Another excellent variety of the dish is also made by coverii^ 
the fowl thickly with veij fine bread-crumbs, moistening them with 
churified butter, and giving them colour with a salamander^ or in a 
quick oven.* 

FRXTOT OF COLD FOWLS 

Cut into joints and take the skin fh>m some cold fowls, lay them 
into a deep dish, strew over them a little fine salt and cayenne, add 
the juice of a lemon, and let them remain for an hour, moving them 
occasionally that they may all absorb a portion of the add ; then dip 
them one by one into some French batter (see Chapter Y.), and fry 
theia a pale brown over a gentle fire. Serve them garnished witn

about June or early in July. Daddings (or half>grown ducks) are in the 
greatest reqnest in spring, when there is no game in the market, and other 
poultry is somewhat scarce.] 

In preparing these for the spit, be 
careful to clear the skin entirely 
from the stumps of the feathers ; 
take off the hoids and necks, but 
leave the feet on, and hold them for 
a few minutes in boiling water to 
loosen the tskin, which must be 
peeled off. Wash the inside of the 
birds by pouring water through 
Ducks ^nraed. them, but merely wipe the outsides 

with a dry cloth. Put into the bodies a seasoning of parboiled 
onions mixed with minced sage, salt, pepper, and a slice of butter 
when this mode of dressing them is liked ; but as the taste of a whole 
party is seldom in its favour, one, when a cou|>le are roasted, is often 
served without the stuffing. Gut off the pinions at the first joint 
from the bodies, truss the feet behind the backs, spit the birds firmly, 
and roast them at a brisk fire, but do not place them sufficiently near 
to be scorched ; baste them constantlv, and when the breasts are well 
plumped, and the steam from them draws towards the fire, dish, and 
serve them quickly with a little good brown gravy poured round 
them, and some also in a tureen ; or instead of tnis, with some which 
has been made with the necks, gizzards, and livers well stewed down, 
with a slight seasoning of browned onion, some herbs, and spice.

ducks. 

STBWED DUCK. (eNTR^E.) 

A couple of quite youi^ ducks, or a fine, frdl-grown, but still 
tender one, will be required for this dish. Cut either down neatly 
into joints, and arrange them in a single layer if possible, in a wide 
stewpan ; pour in about three quarters of a pint or strong cold beef 
stock or gravy ; let it be well cleared frt)m scum when it begins to 
hcHlj then throw in a little salt, a rather frill seasoninff of cayenne, 
and a few thin strips of lemon-rind. Simmer the ducks very softly 
for three quarters of an hour, or somewhat longer should the joints 
be large ; then stir into the gravy a tablespoonml of the finest rice- 
flonr, mixed with a wineglassful or rather more of port wine, and a 
dessertspoonful of lemon-juice : in ten minutes after, dish the stew 
tmd som it to table instantly 



280 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. ST. 

The ducks maj be served with a small portion only of their sauce, 
and dished in a circle, with green peas a la FrancaUe heaped high in 
the centre : the lemon-rind and port wine should then be alto^ther 
omitted, and a small bunch of green onions and parsley, with two or 
three young carrots, may be stewed down with the birds, or three or 
four minc^ eschalots, delicately Med in butter, may be used to 
flavour the gravy. The tumi|)8 an bevrre, prepared by the receipt 
of Chapter XYII., may be substituted for the peas ; and a well made 
JSspagnole may take the place of beef stock, when a dish of high 
savour is wished for. A duck is often stewed without being divided 
into joints. It should then be firmly trussed, half roasted at a quick 
fire, and laid into the stewpan as it is taken from the spit ; or well 
browned in some French thickening, then half covered with boiling 
gravy, and turned when partially done : from an hoar to an hour 
and a quarter will stew it well.

water through them : wipe them dry, and

GAME. 

CHAPTER XV. 



281 




TO CHOOSE GAMi:. 

Buck venison, vrhich is in season only from June to Michaelmas, 
is considered tijier than doe venison, which comes into the market in 
October, and remains in season through November and December : 
neither should be cooked at any other part of the year. The 
greater the depth of fat upon the haunch the better the quality of 
the meat will be, provided it be clear and white, and the lean of a 
dark hue. If the cleft of the hoof, which is always left on the joint, 
be small and smooth, the animal is youns ; but it is old when the 
marks are the reverse of these.** ^Imougn the haunch is the prime 
and tavourite joint of venison, the neck and shoulder are also 
excellent, dressed in various ways, and make much approved pies or 
poMticM as they are usually called. K kept to the proper point, and 
w^ dressed, this is the most tender of all meat; but care is 
necessary to bring it into a fitting state for table without its be- 

* It mutt be observed that TeniBon is not in periSection when young: like 
mntton, it requires to be of a certain age before it is brought to table. The 
word d^ applies also to the thickest part of the hauneh. and it is the depth gl 
the fat oa this which decides the ooalitj of the joint. 



282 MODEBK COOKEBT. [cHAP. ZY 

coming offensive. A free current of air in a larder is always a great 
advantagje, as it assists materially in preserring the sweetness of 
every thing which is kept in it, while a close damp atmosphere, on 
the contra^, is more destnictiye of animal food of all kinds eren 
than positive heat. The fumes of creosote are said to be an 
admirable presenratiye against putrescence, but we have not our- 
selves yet had experience of the fact. All moisture should be wiped 
daily, or even more frequently, from the venison, with soft cloths, 
when any appears upon the surface ; and every precaution must be 
taken to keep off the flies, when the joint is not hung in a wire-safe. 
Black pepper thickly powdered on it will generdly answer the 
purpose : with conmion care, indeed, meat may alwajrs be protected 
from their attacks, and to leave it exposed to them in warm weather 
is altogether inexcusable in the cook. 

Hares and rabbits are stiff when freshly killed, and if young, the 
ears tear easily, and the claws are smooth and sharp. A hiue in 
cold weather will remain good from ten to fourteen days ; care onl^ 
must be taken to prevent the inside from becoming musty, which it 
will do if it has been emptied in the field. Pheasants, partridges, 
and other game may be chosen by nearly the same tests as poultry : 
by opening the bill, the staleness will be detected easily if they have 
been too lon^ kept. With few exceptions, game depends almost 
entirely for the mie flavour and the tenderness of its flesh, on the 
time which it is allowed to hang before it is cooked, and it is never 
good when very fresh ; but it does not follow that it should be sent 
to table in a rdidly offensive state, for this is agreeable to few eaten 
and disgusting to many, and nothing should at any time be served 
of which the appearance or the odour may destroy the appetite of any 
person present. 

TO ROAST ▲ HAUNCH OF YENISON. 

To give venison the flavour 
and the tenderness so much 
prized by epicures, it must be 
well kept ; and by taking the 
I necessary precautions, it will 
^ hang a considerable time 
without detriment. Wipe it 
with soft dry cloths wherever 
the slightest moisture appears on the surface, and dust it plentifully 
with fre8hly-^;round peeper or powdered ginger, to preserve it fix)in 
the flies. The application of the pyroli^eous or acetic add would 
effectually protect it from these, as well as from the effects of the 
weather ; but the joint must then be, not only well washed, but 
Booked for some considerable time, and this would be very detrimental. 
To prepare the venison for the spit, wash it slightly with tepid 
water or merely wipe it thoroughly with damp cloths, and dry it 
-afterwards with clean ones; then lay over the fat side a laige sheet 




CHAP. XT.] GAME. 283 

of thickly-buttered paper, and next a paste of flour and water about 
three quarters of an inch thick ; cover this a^ain with two or three 
idieets of stout paper, secure the whole well with twine, and lay the 
haunch to a sound clear fire ; baste the ^per immediately with 
butter or cluified dripping, and roast the jomt from three hours and 
a half to four and a hali, according to its weight and quality. Doe 
Teoison will require half an hour less time than buck yenison. 
Twenty minutes before the joint is done remove the paste and paper, 
baste uie meat in every part with butter, and dredge it very lightly 
with flour ; let it take a pale brown colour, and send it to table as hot 
as possible with gravy in a tureen, and good currant jelly. It is not 
now customary to serve any other sauces with it ; but should the old- 
fkahioned sharp or sweet sauce be ordered, the receipt for it will b^ 
found at piu;e 100. 

d| to 4i hours. 

Ob$, — ^The kind of gravy appropriate to venison is a matter on 
wludi individual taste must oedde. When preparations of high 
savour are preferred to the pure flavour of the game, the Espagrwle 
(or Spanish sauce) of Chapter IV. can be sent to table with it ; or 
either of the rich English ffravies which precede it When a simple 
mdSavoured one is better liked, some mutton cutlets freed entirely 
fiom fat, then very slightly broiled over a quick fire, and stewed 
gently down in a light extract of mutton prepcu^d by Liebeg's direc- 
tkma, Chapter I., for about an hour, will produce an excellent plain 
gravy : it should be seasoned with salt and pepper (or fine cayenne) 
only. When venison abounds, it should be used for the gravy 
instead of mutton. 

TO STEW A SHOULDER OF VENISON. 

Bone the joint, by the directions given for a shoulder of veal or 
mutton (see Chaut^ XI.) ; flatten it on a table, season it well with 
cayenne, salt, ana pounded mace, mixed with a very small proportion 
of aUspioe; lay over it thin slices of the fiit of a loin of well-fed 
mutton, roll and bind it tiehtly, lay it into a vessel nearly of its 
flize, and pour to it as much good stock made with equal parts of 
beef and mutton as will nearly cover it ; stew it as Aovrlj as possible 
from three hours to three and a half or longer, should it be very 
large, and turn it when it is half done. Dish and serve it with a good 
EtpamalU^ made with part of the gravy in which it has been stewed ; 
4X thicken this slightly with rioe-nour, mixed with a glass or more of 
daiet or of port wine, and as much salt and cayenne as will season 
the gravy properly. 

Some cookf sou: the slices of mutton-fat in wine before they are 
laid upon the joint ; but no process of the sort will ever give to an^ 
kind of meat the true flavour of the venison, which to most eaters is 
far finer than that of the wine, and should always be allowed to 
prevail over all the condiments with which it is dressed. Thoee^

howeyer, who care for it less than for a dish of high artificial savour, 
can have eschalots, ham, and carrot, lightly broomed in good batter^ 
added to the stew when it first b^^ to boiL 
Si to 4 hours. 

TO HASH VENISON.* 

For a superior hash of yenison, add to three quarters of a pint ot 
strong thickened brown gravy, Christopher Korth*s sauce, in the 
proportion directed for it in the receipt of page 295 .f Cut the venison 
in small thin slices of equal size, arrange tnem in a dean saucepcui^ 
pour the gravy on them, let them stana for ten minutes or more, 
then place them near the fire, and bring the whole very slowly to the 
point of boiling only : serve the hash immediately in a not- water dish. 

For a plain dinner, when no gravy is at hand, break down the 
bones of tne venison sxnall, after the flesh has been cleared from them, 
and boil them with those of three or four undressed mutton-cutlets, a 
slice or two of carrot, or a few savoury herbs, and about a pint and a 
half of water or broth, until the liquid is reduced quite one third. 
Strain it ofi*, let it cool, skim off all the fat, heat the gravy, thicken 
it when it boils with a dessertspoonful or rather more of arrow-root, 
or with the brown roux of pa^e 107, mix the same sauce with it, and 
finish it exactly as the richer hash above. It may be served on sip- 
pets of fried bread or not, at choice. 

TO BOAST A HARE. 

[In season from September to the Ist of March.] 

After the hare has been skinned, or cased, as it is called, wash it 
very thoroughly in cold water, and afterwards in warm. If in any 
d^ree overkept, or musty in the inside, which it will sometimes he 

when emptied before it is hun^

ten minutes with lukewarm water mixed with a very little salt ; throw 
this away, and put into the nan a quart or more of new milk $ keep 
it constantly laded over the hare until it is nearly dried up, then add 
a large lump of butter, flour the hare, and continue the basting 
steadily until it is well browned ; for unless this be done, and the 
roast be kept at a proper distance from the fire, the outside will 
become so dry and hard as to be quite uneatable. Serve the hare 
when done, with good brown gravy (of which a little should be 
poured round it in the dish), and with fine red currant jelly. This 
18 an approved English method of dressing it, but we would recom- 
mend m preference, that it should be basted plentifully with butter 
from the b^pnning (the strict economist may substitute clarified beef- 
dripping, or marrow, and finish with a small quantity of butter 
only^ ; and that the salt and water should be altogether omitted. 
Fiik-rate cooks merely wipe the hare inside and out, and rub it with 
its own blood before it is laid to the fire ; but there is genexully a 
rankness about it, especially after it has been many days killed, 
which, we should say, renders the washing indispensable, unless a 
coarse game-flavour he liked.

ROAST HARB. 

{Superior Receipt) 

A hare may be rendered fiu: more plump in appearance, and infi- 
nitely easier to carve, by taking out the bones of tne back and thighs, 
or of the former only : in removing this a very sharp knife should 
De used, and much care will be reauired to avoid cutting through the 
skin just over the spine, as it adheres closely to the b3ne. K'early 
double the usual quantity of forcemeat must be prepared : with this 
restore the legs to their original shape, and fill the body, which 
^ould previously be lined with delicate slices of the nicest bacon, of 
which the rind and edees have been trimmed away. Sew up the 
hare, truss it as usual ; hurd it or not, as is most convenient, keep it 
basted plentifully with butter while roasting, and serve it with the 
customai^ sauce. We have foxmd two tablespoonsful of the finest 
currant jelly, mdted in half a pint of rich brown gravy, an accept- 
able accompaniment to hare, when the taste has been in favour of a 
sweet sauce. 

To remove the back-bone, clear from it first the flesh in the inside; 
lay this back to the right and left from the centre of the bone to the 
tips ; then work the knife on the upper side quite to the spine, and 
when the whole is detached except the skin which adheres to this, 
aeparate the bone at the first joint from the neck-bone or ribs (we 
know not how more correctly to describe it), and pass the knife with 
lantion under the skin down the middle of the back. The directions 
for boning the thighs of a fowl will answer equally for those of 
a hare, aiS we themore refer the reader to them.

Wash and soak the hare thoroughly, wipe it y^ dir, cut it down

of gravy, and stew the hare very fently m>m an hour and a half to 
two hours : when it is about one third done add the very thin rind dt 
half a laige lemon, and ten minutes before it is served stir to it a 
large dessertspoonful of rice-flour, smoothly mixed with two table- 
spoonsful of good mushroom catsup, a quarter of a teaspoonful or 
more of mace, and something less of cayenne. This is an excellent 
nlain receipt for stewing a hye; but the dish may be enriched with 
forcemeat (No. 1, Chapter VUI.) rolled into small balls, and sim- 
mered for ten minutes m the stew, or fried and added to it after it is 
dished ; a higher seasoning of spice, a couple of glasses of port wine» 
with a little additional thickening and a tablespoonftd of lemon-joioe, 
will all serve to give it a heightened relish.

brisk fire, and baste it constantly with butter. Flour it well soon 
after it is laid down. Serve it with good brown gravy, and with 
currant jelly, when this last is liked. For change, the back of the 
rabbit may be larded, and the bone left in, or not, at pleasure; or it 
can be plain roasted when more convenient.

TO BOIL BABBITS. 

Rabbits that are three parts grown, 
or, at all events, whidi are stifl quite

of cooking. Wash them well, tmas 
them firmly, with the heads turned 
and skewered to the sides, drop them

them quite covered until they axe 
cooked, and simmer them gently firom thirty to foity-five miautes:

when WTV young they will require eyen leas time than this. Cover 
them with rich white sauce, mixed with the livers parboiled, finely 
pounded, and well seasoned with cayenne and lemon^juice; or with 
white onion sauce, or with parsley and butter, made with milk or 
cream instead of water (the hyers, minced, are often added to the last 
of these), or with good mushroom sauce. 
30 to 45 minutes. 

FRIED RABBIT. 

After the rabbit has been emptied, thoroughly washed and soaked^ 
should it require it to remove any mustiness of smell, blanch it, that 
is to say, put it into boiling water and let it boll from five to seven 
minutes ; drain it, and when cold or nearly so, cut it into joints, dip 
them into beaten egg, and then into fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and when all are ready, fry them in butter over a 
moderate nre, from twelve to fifteen minutes. Simmer two or three 
fltoips of lemon-rind in a little gravy, until it is well flavoured with 
it ; boil the liver of the rabbit for five minutes, let it cool, and then 
mince it; thicken the gravy with an ounce of butter and a small 
teaspoonful of flour, add the liver, give the sauce a minute*s boil, stir 
in two tablespoonsful of cream if at hand, and last of all, a small 
quantity of lemon-juice. Dish the rabbit, pour the sauce under it, 
and serve it quickly. If preferred, a gravy can be made in the pan 
as for veal cutlets, and the rabbit may be simply fried.

lior two or three weeks, if from that time hung in a well-yentilated larder they 
eontanne, correctly speaking, in iea$on so long as they can be preserved kt for

to other TSiieties of game.] 

Unless kept to the proper point, a pheasant is 
one of the most tough, diy, and flavourless birds 
that is sent to table; but when it has hung as 
many days as it can without becoming really 
tainted, and is well roasted and served, it is most 
excellent eating. Pluck oflfthe feathers carefully, 
cut a slit in the back of the nedc to remove the 
crop, then draw the bird in the usual way, and 
either wipe the inside very clean with a damp 
doth, or pour water through it; wipe the outside ^^h^iTui^'^ 
also, but with a dry cloth ; cut off the toes, turn 
the head of the bird under the wins, with the bUl laid straight along 
the breast, skewer the 1^, which must not be crossed, lour the 
pheasant well, lay it to a brisk fire, and baste it constantly and 
plentifully with well flavoured butter. Send bread-sauce and good 
brown gravy to table with it. The entire breast of the bird may be 
larded by the directions of Chapter X When a brace is served, one

BOUDIN OF PHEASANT A LA RICHELIEU. (eNTr£e.) 

Take, quite clear from the bones, and £rom all skin and sinew, the 
flesh of a half-roasted pheasant; mince, and then pound it to the 
smoothest paste ; add an equal bulk of the floury part of some fine 
roasted potatoes, or of such as have been boiled by Captain Kater's 
receipt (see Chapter XVIL), and beat them together until they are 
well blended ; next throw into the mortar something less (in volume) 
of fresh butter than there was of the pheasant-^sh, with a high 
seasoning of mace, nutmeg, and cayenne, and a half-teaspoonfbl or 
more of salt; poimd the mixture afr^ for ten minutes or a quarter 
of an hour, keeping it turned from the sides of the mortar into the 
middle; then add one by one, after merely taking out the ^erms 
with the point of a fork, two whole eggs and a yolk or two without 
the whites, if these last will not render the mixture too moist. 
Mould it into the form of a roll, lay it into a stewpan rubbed with 
butter,' jMur boilinjy^ water on it and poach it gently from ten to 
fifteen minutes. Lift it out with care, drain it on a sieve, and when 
It is quite cold cover it equallv with beaten e^, and then with the 
finest bread-crumbs, and broil it over a clear fire, or fry it in butter 
of a dear golden brown. A good gravy should be made of the 
remains of Uie bird and sent to table with it; the flavour may be 
heightened with ham and eschalots, as directed in Chapter IV., pa^ 
96, and small mushrooms^ sliced sideways, and stewed quite tender in 
butter, may be mixed with the houdin after it is taken from the 
mortar ; or their flavour may be given more delicately by adding to 
it only the butter in which they have been simmerea, well presed, 
from them through a strainer. The mixture, which should be set 
into a very cool place before it is moulded, may be made into several 
small rolls, which will require four or five minutes* poaching only. 
The flesh of partridges will answer quite as well as that of pheasant! 
for this dish.

selves. Where game is plentiful we re- 
commend that the remains of a cold roasted partridge should be 
well bnused and boiled down with just so much water, or unfla- 
Yonred broth, as will make gravy for a brace of other birds : this, 
seasoned with salt, and cayenne only, or flavoured with a few mush- 
rooms, will be found a very superior accompaniment for roast part- 
ridges, to the best meat-gravy that can be made. A little eschalot, 
and a few herbs, can be added to it at pleasure. It should be served 
also with boiled or with broiled partridges in preference to any other. 

30 to 40 minutes. 

OAf.— Bather less time must be allowed when the birds are liked 
nnderdressed. In preparing them for the spit, the crop must be 
removed through a slit cut in the back of the neck, the claws clipped 
dose, and the legs held in boiling water for a minute, that they may 
be skinned the more easily. 

BOILED PARTRIDGES. 

This is a delicate mode of dressing young and tender birds. Strip 
off the feathers, clean, and wash them well ; cut off the heads, truss 
the legs like those of boiled fowls, and when ready, drop them into a 
large pan of boiling water; throyr a little salt on them, and in 
fifteen, or at the utmost in eighteen minutes they will be ready to 
serve. Lift them out, dish them quickly, and send them to table 
with white mushroom sauce, with bread sauce and game gravy (see 
preceding receipt), or with celery sauce. Our own mode of having 
them served is usually with a slice of fresh butter, about a table- 
spoonful of lemon-juice, and a good sprinkling of cayenne placed in 
a very hot dish, under them. 

15 to 18 minutes* 

PARTRIDGES WITH MUSHROOMS. 

For a brace of young well-kept birds, prepare from half to three 
qnarters of a pint of mushroom-buttons, or very small flaps, as for 
picklin|^. Dissolve over a gentle fire an ounce and a half of butter, 
Sbiow in the mushrooms with a slight sprinkling of salt and

whole into the hodies of the partridges, sew them up, truss them 
securely, and roast them on a vertical jack with the heads down- 
wards; or should an ordinary spit be used, tie them firmly to it, 
instead of passing it through them. Boast them the usual time, and 
serve them with brown mushroom sauce, or with gravy and bread 
sauce only, i The birds may be trussed like boiled fowls, lloured, and 
lightly browned in butter, half covered with rich brown gravy and 
stewed slowly for thirty minutes; then turned, and simmered for 
another half hour with uie addition of some mushrooms to the gravy ; 
or they may be covered with small mushrooms stewed apart, when 
they are sent to table. They can also be served with tneir sauce 
only, simply thickened with a small quantity of fresh butter, smoothly* 
mixed with less than a teaspoonful of arrowroot and flavoured with 
cayenne and a little catsup, wine, or store sauce.

send it quickly to table with a sauce made of a good slice of butter 
browned with flour, a little water, cayenne, sut, and mushroom- 
catsup, poured over it.*' We give this receipt exactly as we received 
it from a house where we know it to have been greatly approved by 
various guests who have partaken of it there.

After having prepared the bird with great nicety, divided, and 
flattened it, season it with salt, and pepper, or cayenne, dip it into 
clarified butter, and then into very fine bread-crumbs, and take care 
that every part shall be equally covered : if wanted of particularly 
good ajppearance dip it a second time into the butter and crumbs.

flavonr. It does not, we believe, abound conunonly in England, its 
hostility to the gray partridge, which it drives always from its neigh- 
bourhoNod, rendering it an undesirable occupant of a preserve. It was 
at one time, however, plentiful in Suffolk,* and in one or two of the 
adjoining counties, but great efforts, we have understood, have been 
made to exterminate it 

TO ROAST THE LANDRAIL OR CORN-CRAKE. 

This delicate and excellent bird is in its full season at the end of 
August and early in September, when it abounds often in the poul- 
terers' shops. Its plumage resembles that of the partridge, but it is 
of smaller size and of much more slender shai)e. Strip off the fea- 
thers, draw and prepare the bird as usual for tne spit, truss it like a 
snipe, and roast it quickly at a brisk but not a fierce fire from fifteen 
to eighteen minutes. Dish it on fried bread-crumbs, or omit these 
and serve it with gravy round it, and more in a tureen, and with well 
made bread sauce. Three or even four of the birds will be required 
for a dish. One makes a nice dinner for an invalid. 

TO ROAST BLACK COCK AND GRAY HEN. 

In season dniixig the same time as the common grouse, and found like them on 
the moors, but less abundantly. 

These birds, so delicious when well kept and well roasted, are 
tough and comparatively flavourless when too soon dressed. They 
should hsDf therefore till they give unequivocal indication of being 
ready for the spit. Fick and draw them with exceeding care, ss the 
«kin is easily broken ; truss them like pheasants, lay them at a mo- 
derate distance from a clear brisk fire, baste them plentifullv and 
constantly with butter, and serve them on a thick toast whicn has 
been laid under them in the dripping-pan for the last ten minutes of 
their roastmg, and which will have imbibed a hish degree of savour : 
some cooks squeeze a little lemon-juice over it before it is put into 
the pan. Send ridi brown gravy and bread sauce to table with the 
birds. From three quarters of an hour to a full hour will roast 
them. Though kept to the pomt which we have recommended, they 
inll not offend even the most fastidious eater after they are dressed, 
as, unless they have been too long allowed to hang, the action of the 
fire will remove aU perceptible traces of their previous state. In the 
earlier |nrt of the season, when warm and close packing have ren- 
dered either black same or grouse, in their transit from the North, 
apparently altogether unfit for table, the chloride of soda, well- 
diluted, may be used with advantage to restore them to a fitting 
state for it ; though the copious washings which must then be re* 
sorted to, may diminish something of their fine flavour.

TO ROAST GROUSE. 

Handle the birds yerjr lightly in plncking off the feathers ; dnw 
them, and wipe the insidea with clean damp cloths ; or first wash, 
and then dry them well ; though this latter mode wonld not be ap- 
pioyed senerally by epicures. Tmss the gronse in the same manner 
as the bmck game above, and roast them about half an hour at a clear 
and bride me, keeping them basted almost without intermission. 
Senre them on a buttered toast which has been laid under them in the 
pan for ten minutes, or with gravy and bread sauce only. 

I hour to 35 minutes. 

Obs. — ^There are few occasions, we think, in which the contents of 
the dripping-pan can be introduced at table with advantage; but in 
dressinjf moor game, we would strongly recommend the toast to be 
laid in it under the birds, as it will afford a superior relish even to the 
birds themselyes. 

A SALMI OP MOOR FOWL, PHEASANTS, OR PARTRIDGES. 
(ENTRiB.) 

This is an excellent mode of serving the remains of roasted game^ 
but when a superlative salmi is desired, the birds must be scarcely 
more then halt roasted for it In either case carve them very neaUy, 
and strip every particle of skin and fat from the legs, wings, and 
breasts ; bruise the bodies well, and put them with the skin and other 
trimmings into a very clean stewpan. If for a simple and inexpensive 
dinner, merely add to them two or three sliced eschalots, a bay leaf, 
a small blade of mace, and a few peppercorns; then pour in a pint or 
rather more of good veal grav^ or strong broth, and boil it briskly 
until reduced nearly half; strain the gravy, pressing the bones well 
to obtain all the flavour, skim off the fat, aod a little cayenne and 
lemon-juice, heat the game very gradualhr in it, but do not on any 
account allow it to bou ; place sippets or fried bread round a dish, 
arrange the birds in good form in the centre, give the sauce a boil,, 
and pour it on them. This is but a homely sort of salmi, though of 
excellent flavour if well made; it may require perhaps the ad£tion 
of a little thickening, and two or three glasses of ory white wine 
poured to the bodies of the birds with tne broth, would bring it 
nearer to the French salmi in flavour. As the spongy substance in 
the inside of moor fowl and black game is apt to be extremely bitter 
when they have been long kept, care should be taken to remove such 
parts as would endanger the preparation.

thighs, wings, and breasts, arrange the points evenly in a clean stew-- 
pan, and keep them covered from the au: and dust till wanted. Cnt 
down into dice four ounces of the lean of an unboiled ham, and put 
it, with two ounces of butter, into a thick well-tinned saucepan or 
stewpan ; add three or four minced eschalots (more, should a high 
favour of them be liked), two ounces of sliced carrot, four cloves, 
two bay leaves, a dozen peppercorns, one blade of mace, a small spriff 
or two of thyme, and part of a root of parsley, or two or three smaU 
branches of the leaves. Stew these over a gentle fire, stirring or 
abating them often, until the sides of the saucepan appear of a red- 
dish-brown, then mix well with them a dessertspoonful.of flour, and 
let it take a little colour. Next, add by degrees, making the sauce 
boil as each portion is thrown in, three quarters of a pint of strong 
veal stock or gravy, and nearlv half a pmt of sherry or Madeira ; put 
in the well-bruised bodies of the birds, and boil them from an hour 
to an hour and a half; straiii, and clear the sauce quite from fiit; 
pour it on the joints of game, heat them in it slowly ; and when they 
are near the point of boUing, dish them immediately with delicately 
fried sippets round the disn. When mushrooms can be obtained, 
throw a dozen or two of small ones, with the other seasonings, into 
the butter. The wine is sometimes added to the vegetables, and 
one half reduced before the gravy is poured in; but though a 
sance of fine colour is thus produced the flavour of the wine is en- 
tirely lost 

TO ROAST WOODCOCKS OR SNIPES. 

[In seaBon during the winter montbs, but not abundant nntil frost seta in.] 

Handle them as little and as lightly as possible, and pluck off the 
feathers gently ; for if this be violently done the skin of the birds 
will be broken. Do not draw them^ but after having wiped them 
with clean soil cloths, truss them with the head under the winff, and 
the bill laid close along the breast ; pass a slight skewer throng the 
thighs, catch the ends with a bit of twine, and tie it across to keep the 
le^ straight Suspend the birds with the feet downwards to a bird- 
iipit, flour them well, and baste them with butter, which should be 
ready dissolved in the pan or ladle. Before the trail begins to drop, 
whicn it will do as soon as they are well heated, lay a tmck round of 
bread, freed from the crust, toasted a delicate brown, and buttered on 
both sides, into the pan under them to catch it, as this is considered 
finer eating even than the flesh of the birds ; continue the basting. 
Jetting the butter fall from them into the basting-spoon or ladle, as 
it cannot be collected again fr^m the dripping-pan should it drop 
there, in consequence of the toast or toasts being in it There should 
be one of these for each woodcock, and the trsil should be spread 
equally over it When the birds are done, which thev will be, at a 
brisk fire, in from twenty to twenty-five minutes, lay the toasts inta

[All irild-fowl is in foU season in mid--wmter : the more severe the veetho;

This beautifhl bird is by no means rare upon our eastern coast, bot 
we know not whether it be much seen in the markets generalh'. It 
is most excellent eating, and should be roasted at a clear quick fiic» 
well floured when first laid down, turned briskly, and basted vitk 
butter almost without cessation. If drawn from the spit in fins 
twenty-five to thirty minutes, then dished and laid before the fire &r 
two or three more, it will gire forth a singularly rich gravy. Score 
the breast when it is carved sprinkle on it a little cayenne and fat 
salt, and let a cut lemon be handed roimd the table when the bard ii

and Christopher North^s sauce made hot (For this, see t& w* 
lowing page.) 

20 to 30 minutes. 

TO ROAST WILD DUCKS. 

A bit of soft bread soaked in port wine, or in claret, is a umetimw 
put into them, but nothing more. Flour them well, lay them rather 
near to a very clear and brisk fire, that they may be quickly faroimed, 
and yet retain their juices. Baste them plentifully and ooaatantlT 
with butter, and, if it can be so r^^lated, let the spit turn with tbeoi 
rapidly. IVom fifteen to twenty minutes will roast them sufficJesdr 
for the generality of eaters ; but for those who obiect to theai man 
imderdressed, a few additional minutes must be aUowed. Something 
less of time will suffice when they are prepared for persons who like 
them scarcely more than heated throu^. 

Teal, which is a more delicate kind of wild fowl, is roasted in the 
same way : in from ten to fifteen minutes it will be enough done fat 
the fashionable mode of serving it, and twenty minutes will dress ii 
well at a good fire.

MODERN COOKERY* 



[chap, xvl 



CHAPTER XVL 

€mus, |oM Pats, &t. 




The great superiority of the oriental curries over those generally 
prepared in England is not, we believe, altogether the result of a 
•want of skill or of experience on the part of our cooks, but is attri- 
butable in some measure, to many of the ingredients, which in a 
fresh and green state add to much to their excellence, being here 
Tbeyond our reach. 

With us, turmeric and cayenne pepper prevail in them often 
far too powerfully : the prodigal use of the former should be 
especially avoided, as it injures both the quality and the colour of 
the currie, which ought to be of a dark green, rather than of a red 
or yellow hue. A couple of ounces of a sweet, sound cocoa-nut, 
lightly grated and stewed for nearly or quite an hour in the 
gravy of a currie, is a great improvement to its flavour : it will be 
found jmrticularly agreeable wim that of sweetbreads, and may be 
served in the currie, or strained from it at pleasure. Great care 
however, should be taken not to use, for the purpose, a nut that is 
rancid. Spinagc, cucumbers, vegetable marrow, tomatas, acid apples, 
green gooseberries (seeded), and tamarinds imported in the shell — not 



CHAF. XTl.] CUBBIES, POTTED HEATS, &C. 297 

prescrred — may all, in their season, be added, with yeiy good effect, 
to curries of different kinds. Potatoes and celery are also occasionally 
boiled down in them. 

The rice for a cnrrie should always be sent to table in a separate 
dish from it, and in serring them, it should be first helped, and the 
eonie laid upon it. 

MS. AXM0TT*8 GURBIE-rOWDBB 

Turmeric, eight ounces.* 

Coriander seed, four ounces. 

Cummin seed, two ounces. 

Foenugreek seed, two ounces. 

Cayenne, half an ounce. (More or less of this 
last to the taste.) 
Let the seeds be of the finest quality. Dry them well, pound, and 
sift them separately through a lawn sieve, then weigh, and mix 
them in the above proportions. This is an exceedingly agreeable 
and aromatic powder, when all the ingredients are penectly fresh 
and good, but the preparing is rather a troublesome process. Mr. 
Amott recommends that when it is considered so, a ** high -caste** 
chemist should be applied to for it 

MR. ARNOTt's CURRIE. 

^* Take the heart of a cabbag^e, and nothing but the heart, that 
is to say, pull awajr all the outside leaves unm it is about the size 
of an egg ; chop it fine, add to it a couple of apples sliced thin. 
the juice of one lemon, half a teaspoonful of black pepper, with 
one large tablespoonful of my cume-powder, and mix toe whole 
well together. Now take six onions that have been chopped fine 
and fried brown, a garlic head, the size of a nutmeg, also minced 
fine, two ounces of fresh butter, two tablespoonsful orflour, and one 
innt of strong mutton or beef gravy ; and when these articles are 
boiling, add tne former ingredients, and let the whole be well stewed 
up together : if not hot enough, add cayenne pepper. Next put in a 
fowl that has been roasted and nicely cut up ; or a rabbit ; or some 
lean chops of pork or mutton ; or a lobster, or the remains of yester- 
day's cafrs head ; or anything else you may fancy ; and you will 
have an excellent currie, fit for kings to partake of. 

•* WcU I now for the rice I It should be put into water which 
should be frequently changed, and should remam in for half an hour 
at least ; this both clears and soaks it. Have your saucepan fall of 
water (the larger the better), and when it boils rapidly, throw the 
rice into it : it will be done in fifteen minutes. Strain it into a dish, 
wipe the saucepan dry, return the drained rice into it, and put it over

a gentle fire for a few minutes, with a cloth over it : eycrj grain wHL 
be separate. When served, do not cover the dish/* 

Obs. — We have already given testimony to the excellence of Mr. 
Amott*8 currie-powder, but we think the currie itself will be found 
somewhat too acid for English taste in general, and the proportion of 
onion and garlic by one half too much for any but well seasoned 
Anglo-Indian palates. After havina; tried his method of boiling the 
rice, we still give the preference to that of Chapter L, page 36. 

A BENGAL CUBRIE. 

Slice and fry three large onions in two ounces of butter, and 
lift them out of the pan when done. Put into a stewpan thiee 
other large onions and a small clove of garlic which have been 
pounded together, and smoothly mixed with a dessertspoonful of the 
best pale turmeric, a teaspoonful of powdered gin^r, one of salt, and 
one of cayenne pepper ; add to these the butter m which the onions 
were fried, and half a cupful of good gravy ; let diem stew for about 
ten minutes, taking care that they shall not bum. Next, stir to them 
the fried onions and half a pint more of gravy ; add a pound and a 
half of mutton, or of any other meat, free from bone and fat, and 
simmer it gently for an hour, or more should it not then be perfectly 
tender. 

Fried onions, 3 large; butter, 2 oz.; onions pounded, S laige; 
garlic, 1 dove ; turmeric, 1 dessertspoonful ; powdered ginger, salt» 
sayenne, each 1 teaspoonful ; gravy, ^ cupful : 10 minutes. Gravy^ 
} pint ; meat, 1) lb. : 1 hour or more 

A DRT CURRIE. 

Skin and cut down a fowl into small joints, or a couple of pounds 
of mutton, free fVom fat and bone, into very small iMtk cutlets; rub 
them with as much currie-powder, mixed with a teaspoonful of flour 
and one of salt, as can be made to adhere to them : tnis will be from 
two to three tablespoonsfhl. Dissolve a good slice of butter in a deep, 
well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, and shake it over a brisk fire for 
four or five minutes, or until it b^ins to take colour ; then put in the 
meat, and brown it well and equally, without allowing a morsel to be 
scorched. The pan should be shaken vigorously every minute or 
two, and the meat turned in it frequently. When this is done, lift it 
out and throw into the stewpan two or three large onions finely 
min<^, and four or five eschalots wh^n these last are liked ; add • 
morsel of butter if needftil, and fry them until they begin to soften ; 
then add a quarter of a pint of gravy, broth, or boiling water, and a 
laree acid apple, or two moderate-sized ones, of a good boiling kind, 
with the hearts of two or three lettuces, or of one hard cabbage, shred 
quite small (tomatas or cucumbers freed fVom their seeds can be sub- 
stituted for these when in season). Stew the whole dowly until It

resembles a thick pulp, and add to it any additional liqnid that may 
be leooired, should it become too dry ; put in the meat, and simmer 
the vrhoLe veiy sofUy until this is done, which will be in from three 
quarters of an hour to an hour. 

Prawns, shrimps, or the flesh of boiled lobsters may be slowly 
heated through, and served in this currie sauce with good effect, 

A COMMON INBIAK CURRIE. 

For each pound of meat, whether veal, mutton, or beef, take a. 
heaped tabl^poonful of ^ood currie powder, a small teaspoonful of 
salt, and one of flour ; mix these well together, and after haying cut 
down the meat'into thick small cutlets, or dice, rub half of the imxed 

Eler equally over it Next, fry gently from one to four or five 
onions sliced, with or without the addition of a small clove of 
: or half a dozen eschalots, according to the taste ; and when they^ 
are of a fine golden brown, lift them out with a slice and lay them 
upon a sieve to drain ; throw a little more butter into the pan and 
fiy the meat lightly in it ; drain it well from the fat in taking it out, 
and lay it into a clean stewpan or saucepan ; strew the onion over it, 
and pour in as much boiling water as will almost cover it. Mix the 
remamder of the curiie-powder smoothly with a little broth or cold 
water, and after the currie has stewed for a few minutes pour it in. 
shaking the pan well round that it may be smoothly blended with 
the gravy. Simmer Uie whole very softly until the meat is perfectly 
tender : this will be in from an hour and a quarter to two hours and 
a half, according to the quantity and the nature of the meat. 
Mutton will be the soonest done ; the brisket end (gristles) of a breast 
of veal will require twice as much stewing, and sometimes more. A 
fowl wUl be ready to serve in an hour. An acid apple or two, or any 
of the vegetables which we have enumerated at the commencement of 
this chai>ter, may be added to the currie, proper time being allowed 
for cooking each variety. Yeiy young green peas are liked by some 
people in it ; and cucumbers pared, se^ed, and cut moderately small,. 
are always a good addition. A richer currie will of course be pro- 
duced if gravy or broth be substituted for the water : either should 
be boiling when poured to the meat. Lemon-juice should be stirred 
in before it is served, when there is no other acid in the currie. A 
dish of boiLed rice must be sent to table with it. A couple of pounds- 
of meat free fit)m bone, is sufficient quite for a moderate-sized dish 
of this kind, but three of the breast of veal are sometimes used 
for it, when it is to be served to a larce family-party of currie-eaters; 
from half to a whole pound of rice snould then accompany it. For 
the proper mode of boiling it, see page 36. The small grained, or 
Patna, is the kind which ought to be used for the purpose. Six 
ounces is suflicient for a not liurge. currie ; and a pound, when boiled 
dry, and heated lightly in a dish, apoears an enormous quantity for a 
Diodem table. 



300 MODERN COOKEBY. [cSAF. XTI 

To each poand of meat, whether veal, mntton, or beef, 1 heaped 
tablespoonnil of good currie-powder, 1 small teaspoonful of salt, and 
a laige one of flour, to be well mixed, and hair nibbed on to the 
meat before it is fried, the rest added afterwards ; onions fried, finom 
1 to 4 or 5 (with or without the addition of a clove of garlic, or half

{Captain White's.) 

These curries arc made with a sort of paste, which is labelled with 
the above names, and as it has attracted some attention of late, and 
the curries made with it are verv good, and quickly and easily 

Erepared, we give the directions iot them. "^ Cut a pound and a 
all of chicken, fowl, veal, rabbit, or mutton, into pieces an inch and 
a half square. Put from two to three ounces of fresh butter in a 
stewpan, and when it is melted put in the meat, and give it a good 
stir with a wooden spoon ; add from two to three dessertspoonsful of 
the currie-paste ; mix the whole up well together, and continue the 
stirring over a brisk fire from five to ten minutes, and the currie will 
be done. This is a dry currie. For a gravy currie, add two or 
three tablespoonsflil of boiling water after the paste is well mixed in, 
and continue the stewing and stirring from ten to twelve minutes 
longer, keeping the sauce of the consistency of cream. Prepare 
salmon and lobster in the same way, but very quickly, that they 
may come up firm. The naste may be rubbed over steaks, or 
cutlets, when they are nearly broiled; three or four minutes will 
finish iJiem.*** 

CURRIED HACCARONT. 

Boil six ounces of ribband maccaroni for fifteen minutes, in water 
slightly salted, with a ver^ small bit of butter dissolved in it ^ drain 
it perfectly, and then put it into a full pint and a quarter of good 
beef or veal stock or gravy, previously mixed and boiled for twenty 
minutes, with a smul tablespoonful of fine currie-powder, a tea- 
spoonful of arrowroot, and a little lemon-juice. Heftt and toss the

nuuicaroiu gently in this nntil it is well and equally covered with it. 
A small quantity of rich cream, or a little bechamel, will very much 
improve the sauce, into which it should be stirred just before the 
maccaroni is added, and the lemon-juice should be thrown in after- 
wards. This dish is, to our taste, far better without the strong 
flavouring of onion or garlic, usually given to curries ; which can, 
however, be imparted to the gravy in the usual way, when it is 
liked. 

Ribband maccaroni, 6 oz. : 15 to 18 minutes. Gravy, or good 
beef or veal stock, full pint and i ; fine currie-powder, 1 small 
tablespoonful ; arrow-root, 1 tcaspoonful; little lemon-juice: 20

is extremely good: the sauce for both Kmds should be made with 
rich gravy, especially when the onion is omitted. A few drops of 
eschalot-vinegar can be added to it when the flavour is liked. 

CURRIED EGOS. 

Boil six or eight freah eggs ^uite hard, as for salad, and put them 
aside until they are cold. Mix well together from two to three 
ounces of good butter, and firom three to four dessertspoonsful of 
currie-powder ; ^a^e them in a stew-pan or thick saucepan, over a 
dear but moderate fire for some minutes, then throw in a couple of 
mild onions finely minced, and fry them gently until they are 
tolerably soft : pour to them, by degrees, from half to three quarters 
of a pint of broth or gravy, and stew them slowly until thev are 
reduced to pulp ; mix smoothly a small cup of thick cream with two 
teaspoonsful or wheaten or of rice-flour, stir them to the currie, and 
simmer the whole until the raw taste of the thickening is gone. 
Cut the eggs into half inch slices, heat them quite through in the 
sauce without boiling them, and servo them as hot as possible. 

CURRIED SWEETBREADS. 

Wash and soak them as usual, then throw them into boiling water 
with a little salt in it, and a whole onion, and let them simmer for 
ten minutes; or, if at hand, substitute weak veal broth for the 
water. Lift them out, place them on a drainer, and leave them 
until they are perfectly cold ; then cut them into half-inch slices, 
and either flour and fiy them lightly in butter, or put them, without 
this, into as much curried gravy as will just cover them ; stew them 
in it very gently, firom twenty to thirty minutes; add as much 
lemon-juice or chili vinegar as will acidulate the sauce agreeably,* 
and serve tiie currie very hot. As we have already stated in two or

three preTious receipts, an ounce or more of sweet ireshly-grated 
cocoa-nut, stewed tender in the gp^vy, and strained from it, bdbre 
the sweetbreads are added, will give a peculiarly pleasant flavour to 
all cunies. 

Blanched 10 minutes ; sliced (fried or not) ; stewed 20 to SO 
minutes. 

CURRIED OYSTERS. 

" Let a hundred of large sea-oysters be opened into a basin 
without losing one drop of their liquor. Put a lump of fresh buttei 
into a ^ood-sized saucepan, and when it boils, add a large onion, cut 
into thin slices, and let it fry in the uncoyered stewpan until it is of 
« rich brown : now add a bit more butter, and two or three table- 
spoonsful of currie-powder. When these ingredients are well mixed 
over the fire with a lyooden spoon, add gradually either hot water, 
or broth from the stock-pot; cover the stewpan, and let the whole 
boil up. Meanwhile, have ready the meat or a cocoa-nut, grated or 
rasped fine, put this into the stewpan with a few sour tamarinds 
(if they are to be obtamed, if nol^ a sour apple, chopped). Let the 
whole slnuner over the fire untQ the apple is dicBolyed, and the 
cocoa-nut very tender ; then add a cupful of strong thidcenini^ made 
of flour and water, and sufficient salt, as a currie will not bear being 
salted at table. Let this boil up for five minutes. Have ready 
•also, a vegetable marrow, or part of one, cut into bits, and sufficiently 
boiled to require little or no i\irther cooking. Put this in with a 
tomata or two ; either of these vegetables ma^ be omitted. Kow 
put into the stewpan the oysters with their bquor, and the milk 
of the cocoa-nut, if it be perfectly sweet ; stir them well with the 
former ingredients ; let the currie stew gently for a few minutes, then 
throw in the strained juice of half a lemon. Stir the currie from 
time to time with a wooden spoon, and as soon as the oysters arc 
done enough serve it up with a corresponding dish of rice on the 
-opposite Ride of the table. The dish is considered at Madras the 
jiepltu ultra of Indian cookery."* 

We have extracted this receipt, as it stands, from the Magazine of 
Domestic Economy, the season in whidi we have met with it not 
permitting us to have it tested. Such of our readers as may have 
partaken of the true Oriental preparation, will be able to judge of 
Its correctness ; and others may consider it worthy of a triaL We 
should suppose it necessary to beard the oysters. 

CURRIED GRAVY, 

The quantity of onion, eschalot, or garlic used for a currie should 
be regulated by the taste of the persons for whom it is prepaied ; the

very lai^ proportions of them which are acceptable to some eaters, 
preventmg others altogether from partaking of the dish. Slice, and 
117 gently in a little good butter, from two to six large onions (with 
a bit of garlic, and four or five eschalots, or none of either), when 
they are coloiu^ equally of a fine yellow-brown, lift them on to a 
sieve reversed to drain ; put them into a clean saucepan, add a pint 
and a half of good gravy, with a couple of ounces of rasped cocoa- 
nut, or of any of the other condiments we have already specified, 
which may require as much stewins as the onions (an apple or two, 
for instance), and simmer them softfy from half to three quarters of 
an hour, or until the onion is sufficiently tender to be pressed 
through a strainer. We would recommend that for a delicate 
currie this should always be done: for a common one it is not 
necessary; and many persons prefer to have the whole of it left in 
this last After the gravy has been worked through the strainer, 
and again boils, add to it from three to four dessertspoons^ of 
cnnie-powder, and one of flour, with as much salt as the gravy may 
requu^, the whole mixed to a smooth batter with a small cm>ful of 
£ood cream.* Simmer it from fifteen to twenty minutes, ana it will 
be ready for use. Lobster, prawns, shrimps, maccaroni, hard-boiled 
eggBy cold calTs head, and various other meats ma;^ be heated and 
served in it with advantage. For all of these, and indeed for every 
kind of currie, add of some sort should be added. Chili vinegar 
answers well when no fresh lemon-juice is at hand. 

Onions, 2 to 6 (garlic, 1 clove, or eschalots, 4 to 5, or neither) ; 
fried a light brown. Gravy, H pint ; cocoa-nut, 2 oz. (3, if very 
young) : 1 to i hour. Currie-powder, 3 to 4 dessertspoonsful ; flour, 
1 desKrtspoonful ; salt, as n^ed; cream, 1 small cupful : 15 to 20 
minutes. 

Obs. — In India, curds axe f^quently added to curries, but that may 
possibly be from their abounding much more than sweet cream in 
so hot a climate; 

POTTED VBATS. 

Any tender and well-roasted meat, taken free of fat, skin, and 
gristle, as well as from the dry outsides, will answer for potting ad- 
mirably, better indeed than that which is generally baked for the 
purpose, and which is usually ouite deprived of its juices by the 
process. Spiced or corned beef also is excellent when thus prepared ; 
and any of these will remain sood a long time if mixed witn cold 
fresh batter, instead of that which is clarified ; but no addition that 
can be made to it will render the meat eatable, unless it be thoroughly 
pownded; reduced, in fact, to the smoothest possible paste, free from a

single lump or a morsel of unbroken fibre. If rent into fragments, 
instead of being quite cut through the grain in being minced, before it 
is put into the mortar, no beatmg vrill bring it to the proper state. 
Umess it be very dry, it is better to pound it for some time before any 
butter is added, and it must be long and patiently beaten after all the 
ingredients are mixed, that the whole may be equally blended and 
well mellowed in flavour. 

The quantity of butter required will depend upon the nature of 
the meat ; ham and salted beef will need a larger proportion than 
roast meat, or than the breasts of poultry and game ; white fish, from 
being less dry, will require comparatively little. Salmon, lobsters, 
prawns, and shrimps are all extremely eood, prepared in this way. 
They should, however, be perfectly fresn when they are pounded, 
and be set immediately afterwards into a very cool place. For these, 
and for white meats in ^neral, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne or white 
pepper, are the appropnate spices. A small quantity of cloves may 
oe added to hare and other brown meat, but allspice we would not re- 
commend unless the taste is known to be in favour of it. The fol- 
lowing receipt for pounding ham will serve as a general one for the 
particular manner of proceeding. 

POTTED HAil. 

(An excellent Receipt) 

To be eaten in perfection this should be made with a freshly cured 
ham, which, after bavins been soaked for twelve hours, should be 
wiped dry, nicely trimmed, closely wrapped in coarse paste, and baked 
very tender. When it comes from the oven, remove the crust and 
rind, and when the ham is perfectly cold, take for each pound of 
the lean, which should be weighed after every morsel of skin and 
fibre has been carefully removed, six ounces of cold roast veal, pre- 
pared with equal nicety. Mince these quite fine with an exceedingly 
sharp knife, taking care to cut through the meat, and not to tear the 
fibre, as on this much of the excellence of the preparation depends. 
Next put it into a large stone or marble mortar, and pound it to the 
smootnest paste with eight ounces of fresh butter, which must be added 
by degrees. When three parts beaten, strew over it a teaspoonftd of 
freshly-pounded mace, half a large, or the whole of a small nutmeg 
ffrated, and the third of a teaspoomul of cayenne well mixed together. 
It is better to limit the spice to this quantity in the first instance, and 
to increase afterwards either of the three kinds to the taste of the 
parties to whom the meat is to be served.! We do not find half a 
teaspoonful of cayenne, and nearly two teaspoonsful of mace, more

than 38 generally approTed. After the spice is added, keep the meat 
often turned firom tne sides to the middle of the mortar, that it ma^ 
be seasoned equsdly in every part When perfectly pounded, press it 
into small potting-pans, and pour darifiea butter* over the top. If 
kept in a cool aim diy place, this meat will remain good for a fort- 
night, or more. 

Lean of ham, 1 lb. ; lean of roast veal, 6 oz. ; fresh butter, 8 oz.; 
mace, firom 1 to 2 teaspoonsful ; | large nutmeg ; cayenne, ^ to ^ tea- 
spoonful. 

Obs.— The roast veal is ordered in this receipt because the ham alone 
is generaUy too salt ; for the same reason butter, fresh taken from the 
chum, or that which is but slightly salted and quite new, should be 
used for it in preference to its own fat. When there is no ready- 
dressed veal in uie house, the best part of the neck, roasted or stewed, 
will supply the requisite quantity. The remains of a cold boiled ham 
will answer quite well for potting, even when a little dry. 

POTTED CHICEEN, PARTRIDGE^ OB PHEASANT. 

Roast the birds as for tabic, but let them be thoroughly done, for 
if the gravy be left in, the meat will not keep half so well. Raise the 
flesh of the breast, wings, and merrythought, quite dear from the 
bones, take off the skin, mince, and then pound it very smoothly with 
about one third of its wdght of fresh butter, or something less, if the 
meat should appear of a proper consistence without the fiul quantity ; 
season it with salt, mace, and cayenne only, and add these in small 
portions until the meat is rather highly flavoured with both the last * 
proceed with it as with other potted meats. 

POTTED OX-TONQDB. 

Boil tender an unsmoked tongue of good flavour, and the following 
day cut from it the quantity desired for potting, or take for this 
purpose the remains of one which has already been served at table 
Trim off the skin and rind, weigh the meat, mince it very small, then 
pound it as fine as possible with four ounces of butter to each pound 
of tongue, a small teaspoonful of mace, half as much of nutmeg and 
doves, and a tolerably high seasoning of cayenne. After the spices 
are well beaten with the meat, taste it, and add more if required. A 
few ounces of any weU-roasted meat mixed with the tongue will give 
it firmness, in which it is apt to be defident. The breasts of turkeys, 
fowls, partridges, or pheasants, may be used for the purpose with good 
effect. 

Tongue, 1 lb.; butter, 4 oz.; mace, 1 teaspoonfhl; nntm^ and

Scrape the anchones very clean, raise the flesh irom the bones, 
and pound it to a perfect paste in a Wedgwood or marble morta? : 
then with the back of a wooden spoon press it through a hair-dere 
reversed. Next, weigh the anchovies, and pound them again with 
double their weight of the freshest butter that can be procured, a high 
feeasoning of mace and cayenne, and a small quantity of finely-grated 
nutmeg ; set the mixture by in a cool place for three or four hours to 
harden it before it is put into the potting pans. If butter be poured 
oyer, it must be only lukewarm ; but the anchovies will keep w^ for 
two or three weeks without. A very small portion of roee-pink ma^ 
be added to improve the colour, but unless it be sroringly used, it 
will impart a bitter flavour to the preparation. The quantity of 
butter can be increased or diminishea in pronortion as it is wished

preferred, it must be cleansed as for roasting, wiped c^,. cat into 
joints, which, after being Reasoned with salt, cayenne for pepper),, 
and pounded cloves and mace or nutmeg well mingled, should 
be closely packed in a jar or deep pan, and slowly baked until 
very tender, with the addition oi Irom half to a whole pound 
of fresh butter laid equally over it, in small bits, or with only 
so much water or other liquid as will prevent its becoming hard : 
the jar must be well covered with at least two separate folds of 
thick brown paper tied closely over it. It should uien be left to 
become perfectly cold; and the butter (when it has been used) 
should b« taken off and scraped free from moisture, that it may be 
added to the hare in pounding it. All skin and sinew must be case- 
fully removed, and the flesh minced before it is put into tke mortar. 
Additional seasoning must be added if necessary ; but the cook must 
remember that all should be well blended, and no particular nribce 
should be allowed to predominate in the flavour of the preparation 
When water or ^vy has been added to the hare, firm mm butter 
should be used m potting it : it will not reouire a very laorge pro- 
portion, as the flesh will be far less dry ana firm than when it is 
roasted, though more of its juices vnll have been withdrawn from k ; 
and it will not remain good so long. The bones, gravy, head, and 
ribs, will make a small tureen of excellent soup. Thick traces of 
lean ham are sometimes baked with the hare, and pounded widt it.

CHAPTER XVII. 




The quality of vegetables depends much both on the soil in which 
thej are gro>Tn, and on the aegree of care bestowed upon their cul- 
ture ; but if produced in ever so great perfection, their ex c ellence 
will be entirely destroyed if they be badly cooked. 

With the exception of artichokes, which are said to be improved 
by two or three days* keeping, all the summer varieties should be 
dressed before their first freshness has in any degree pa«ed off (for 
their flavour is never so fine as within a few hours of tneir being cut 
or gathered) ; but when this cannot be done, precaution should be 
taken to prevent their withering. The stalk-ends of asparagus, 
cucumbers, and "vegetable-marrow, should be placed in from one to 
two inches of cold water ; and all other kinds should be spread on a 
cool brick floor. When this has been neglected, they must be thrown 
into cold water for some time before they are boiled to recover them, 
though they will prove even then but very inferior eating. 

Vegetables when not sufficiently cooked are known to be so ex- 
ceedingly unwholsome and indigestible, that the custom of serving 
them crnsp, which means, in reality, only half-boiled, should bt 
altogether disregarded when health is considered of more importance 
tha;i fofliiori ; but they should not be allowed to remain in the water 



CBAi* xvn.] VEGETABLES. 309 

after they are quite done, or both their nutritive properties and their 
flavour will be lost, and their good appearance destroyed. Care 
should be taken to drain them thoroughly in a warm strainer, and to 
serve them very hot, with well-made sauces, if with any. 

Only dried peas or beans, Jerusalem artichokes, and potatoes, are 
put at first into cold water. All others require plenty of fast-boiling 
water, which should be ready salted and skimmed before they are 
thrown into it 

TO CLEAR YEGETABLES FROM INSECTS. 

Lay them for half an hour or more into a pan of strong brine, with 
the stalk ends uppermost ; this will destroy the small smuls and other 
insects which cluster in the leaves, and they will fall out and sink to 
the bottom. A pound and a half of salt to the gallon of water will 
answer for this purpose, and if strained daily it will last for some 
time. 

TO BOIL VEGETABLES GREEN. 

After they have been properly prepared and washed, throw them 
into plenty of boiling water which has been salted and well skimmed ; 
and Keep them uncovered and boiling fast until they are done, taking 
cTery precaution against their beinc smoked. Should the water be 
Tery hard, a smau half-teaspooniul of carbonate of soda, may be 
added with the salt, for every two quarts, and will greatly improve 
the eolour of the vegetables ; but if used in undue proportion it will 
iigure them ; green peas especially will be quickly peduced to a mash 
if boiled with too large a quantity. 

Water, 1 gallon ; nit, 2 oz : soda, i oz. ; or carbonate of soda, 1

POTATOES. 
(^Remarks on their properties and importance.) 

There is no vegetable commonly cultivated in this country, we 
Tenture to assert, which is comparable in value to the potato when it 
is of a good sort, has been grown in a suitable soil, and is properly 
cooked and served. It must he very nutritious, or it woidd not sus- 
tain the strength of thousands of people whose almost sole food it 
constitutes, and who, when they can procure a sufficient supply of it 
to satisfy fully the demands of hunger, are capable of accomplishing 
the heaviest daily labour. It may not be wise to depend for sub- 
sistenoe on a root of which the crop unhappily is so frequently iu 
these dajrs destroyed or greatly iniured by disease, and for which it 
is so difficult to find a substitute that is equally cheap, wholesome, 
and satisfying ; but we can easily comprehend the predilection of an 
entire people for a tuber whicn combines, like the potato, the so-

lidi^ almost of bread, with the healthful properties* of various other 
fresh vegetables, without their acidity ; and which can also be cooked 
and served in so many different forms. The vrretched manner in 
which it is dressed in man^^ English houses renders it comparativelY 
valueless, and accounts in a measure for the prodigality with 
which it is thrown away when cold, even in seasons when its price 
is highe8t.f 

TO BOIL POTATOES. 

(As in Ireland.) 

Potatoes, to boil well together, should be all of the same sort, and 
as nearly equal in size as may be. Wash off the mould, and scrub 
them very clean with a hard brush, but neither scoop nor apply a 
knife to them in any way, even to clear the eyes.{ Sinse them well, 
and arrange them compactly in a saucepan, so that they may not lie 
loose in the water, ana that a small quantity may suffice to cover 
them. Pour this in cold, and when it boils, throw in about a large 
teaspoonful of salt to the quart, and simmer the potatoes until the^ 
are nearly done, but for the last two or three minutes let them boil 
rapidly. When they are tender quite through, which may be known 
b^ probing them with a fork, pour all the water from them imme- 
diately, lilt the lid of the saucepan to allow the steam to escape, aikt 
^ce them on a trivet, high over the fire, or by the side of it, until 
the moisture has entirely evaporated; then peel, and send them to 
table as quickly as possible, either in a hot napkin, or in a dish, of 
which the cover is so placed that the steam can pass off. There 
should be no dela^ in serving them after they are once taken from 
the fire. Irish &milies always prefer them served in their skins. 
Some kinds will be sufficiently boiled in twenty minutes, others in 
not less than three quarters of an hour. 

20 minutes to 1 hour, or more. 

• The late Dr. Pereira has stated in Us excellent work on diet, page 370, that 
Dr. Baly, who has published some interesting observations on the anti-scorbntis 
qoality of the potato, says, " J$ ordinarily cooked, it it an admirttbU pre$en?atiM 
against the scnrvy," for which it appears to be also a cure, see the same work. 

f We cannot reftain from a few words of remark here on tne daily waste of 
wholesome food in this country which constitatea one of the most serious 
domesHe abuses that exist amongst us ; and one which it is most painful to 
witness whUe we see at the same time the half-starvation of large masses of our 
people. It is an evil which the steady and resolute opposition of the educated 
classes would soon greatly check ; and which ought not vainly to appeal to their 
good sense and good feeling, augmenting, as it must, the privations of the 
6cantily-fed poor; for the " w<utt" of one part of the community cannot fsil io 
increase the " toant " of the remainder. 

I " Because," in the words of our derer Irish correspondent, " the water 
through these parts is then admitted into the reiy heart of the vegetable ; and 
the latent heat, after cooking, is not sufficient to throw it off: this renders the 
potatoes vsry unwhols^me." 



■CHAP. Xm,] VEGETABLES. 311 

Oftf. 1. — ^The water in which they are boiled should barely cover the 
potatoes. After it is poured oS, they should be steamed for twenty 
minutes or half an hour, if large. 

Ohs. 2. — Habitual potato-eaters know well that this vegetable is never 
0O ffood as when served in the skin tne instant it is taken from the fire, 
di^ed in a hot napkin, or sent to table without a cover over it. It 
should also be clean and dry that it may at pleasure be txiken in the 
fillers and broken like bread, or held m the dinner napkin while the 
inside is scooped out with the fork, thus forming it into a sort of cup. 
The large Yorkshire Regents dressed and eaten in this way afford m 
themselves an almost sufficient meal. We have found f^om long 
daily experience, that those which avera^ three, or at the utmost 
four to the pound, were the best in quahty, and remained so to quite 
the end of their season : they required as the spring advanceo, an 
hour*s boiling or more. 

TO BOIL POTATOES. 

(^The Lancashire tcay,) 

Pare the potatoes, cover them with cold water, and boil them slowly 
until they are quite tender, but watch them carefully, that they may 
not be overdone; drain off the water entirely, strew some salt over 
them, leave the saucepan uncovered bv the side of the fire, and shake 
it forcibly every minute or two, untU the whole of the potatoes appear 
dry and floury. Lancashire cooks dress the vegetable in this way to 
perfection, but it is far from an economical mode, as a large portion 
of the potato adheres to the saucepan ; it has, however, many 
admirers. 

10 BOIL NEW POTATOES. 

These are never good unless fireshlv dug. Take them of equal 
fize, and rub off the skins with a brush or a very coarse doth, wash 
them dean, and put them without salt into boiling, or at least, auite 
hot water ; boil them softly, and when they are tender enough to 
serve, pour off the water entirely, strew some fine salt over them, give 
them a shake, and let them stand by the fire in the saucepan for a 
minute; Uien dish and serve them immediately. Some cooks throw 
in a small slice of fresh butter, with the salt, and toss them gently in 
it after it is dissolved. This is a good mode, but the more usual one 
is to send melted butter to table 'with them, or to pour white sauce 
over them when they are very young, and served early in the 
reason. 

Veiy small, 10 to 15 minutes : moderate sized, 15 to 20 minutes. 

Ohs.^Vfe always, for our own eating, have new potatoes steamed 
for ten minutes or longer after the water is poured fh>m them, and 
thii:Jc they are much improved by the process. They should be tho» 
foughlj' boiled before this is done.

saucepan, and simmer them over a gentle iire for about half an hour 
Keep them well shaken or tossed, that they n^be equally done, and

turn it carefully into a dish placed before the fire, throw a doth over, 
and when all are done, send them to table quickly. Potatoes dieased 
in this way are mashed without the slightest trouble ; it is also by far 
the best method of preparing them for puddings or for cakes. 

TO ROAST OR BAKE POTATOES. 

^ Scrub and wash exceedingly clean some potatoes nearly assorted in 
size ; wipe them very dry, ana roast them in a Dutch oven before the 
fire, placing them at a distance from it, and keeping them often 
turned ; or arrange them in a coarse dish, and bake them in a mo* 
derate oven. Disn them neatly in a napkin, and send them very hot 
to table ; serve cold butter with them. 
If to upwards of 2 hours. 

SCOOPED POTATOES. (eNTREMETS.*) 

Wash and wipe some large 
I potatoes of a firm kind, and 
with a small scoop adapted to 
the purpose, t form as many 
diminutive ones as will fill a dish ; cover them with cold water, and 
when they have boiled very gently for five minutes pour it off, and 
put more cold water to them ; after they have simmered a second 
time for five minutes, drain the water quite away, place the cover of 
the saucepan so as to leave an inch or more of open space for the 

* Or second cotirM diab.

moistiire to eraporate, and let them steam by the aide of the £ re from 
four to five minutes longer. Dish them carefully, Dour white sauce 
OTer them, and serve them in the second course. Old potatoes thus 
prepfured, have often been made to pass for new ones, at the best 
tabus, at the season in which the firesh vegetable was dearest.* The 
time required to boil them wUl of course vary with their quality we 
give the method wliich we have found very successful. 

CRISPED POTATOES, OB POTATO-RIBBONS. (eNTRBMXTS.) 

(Or to serve with Cheese,) 

Wash well, and wipe, some potatoes of good flavour; cut them up 
into slices of from half to a whole inch thick, free them fh>m the 
skins, and then pare them round and roxmd in very thin, and vexy 
long ribbons. Lay them into a pan of cold water, and half an hour 
before they are wanted for table lift them on to a sieve that they 
may be well drained. Frv them in good butter, which should be 
very hot when they are thrown in, until they are quite crisp, and 
lightly browned ; drain and dry them on a son cloth, pile them in a 
hot dish, strew over them a mixed seasoning of salt and cayenne in 
fine powder, and serve them without delay. For the second course, 
dress them in the same manner, but omit the cayenne. Five or six 
minutes will fry them 

FRIED POTATOES. ^ENTREMETS.) 

(A Plainer Receipt.) 

After having washed them, wipe and pare some raw potatoes, cut 
them in slices of eoual thickness, or into thin shaving and throw 
them Into plen^r of boiling butter, or very pure clarified dripping. 
Tt^ them of a nne light brown, and very criro ; lift them out with a 
skimmer, drain them on a soft warm cloth, msh them very hot, and 
sprinkle fine salt over them. This is an admirable way of dressing 
potatoes, veiy common on the Continent, but less so in Lngland than 
It deserves to be. Fared in ribbons or shavings of eaual width, as in 
the receipt above, and served dry and well fried, lightly piled in 
a dish, they make a handsome appearance, and are excellent eatinsr 
If slioed they should be somethmg less than a quarter of an incn 
thick. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Boil them perfectly tender quite through, pour off the water, and 
steam them very dry by the directions already given in the receipt of 

^ Tagetables tnd fruit are now to generally foreed and brought so eaily into 
oar nunets, that there k little need of these espedienti at present. 



314 MODEEN COOKEET. [ciUP. XTH. 

pi^ 310, peel them quickly, take out every speck, and while they aro 
BtiU hot, press the potatoes through an earthen cullender, or bruise 
them to a smooth mash with a strong wooden fork or spoon, bat 
never pound them in a mortar, as that will reduce them to a close 
heavy paMe. Let them be entirely free from hanpe^ for nothing can 
be more indicative of carelessness or want of skill on the mirt of the 
cook, than mashed potatoes sent to table full of these. Melt in a 
«lean saucepan a slice of good butter with a few spoonsful of milk, 
or, better still, of cream ; put in the potatoes after having sprinkled 
flome fine salt upon them, and stir the whole over a gentle hre with 
a wooden spoon, until the ingredients are well-mixed, and the whole 
is veiy hot It may then m served directly ; or heaped high in a 
dish, left rough on the surface, and browned before the fire ; or it 
may be pressed into a well buttered mould of handsome form, which 
has been strewed with the finest bread crumbs, and shaken free from 
the loose ones, then turned out, and browned in a Dutch or common 
oven. More or less liquid will be required to moisten sufficiently 
potatoes of various kinds. 

Potatoes mashed, 2 lbs. ; salt, 1 teaspoonful ; butter, 1 to 2 os. ; 
milk or cream, \ pint. 

Oh», — Mashed potatoes are often moulded with a cup, and then 
equally browned : any other shape will answer the purpose as well^ 
and many are of better appearance. 

ENQLISn POTATO BALLS, OR CROQUETTES. 

Boil some floury potatoes very dry, mash them as smoothly as 
possible, season them well with salt and white pepper, warm tnem 
with about an ounce of butter to the pound, or rather more if it will 
not render them too moist, and a few spoonsful of good cream. Boil 
them very dry ; let them cool a little, roll them into balls, sprinkle 
over them vermicelli crushed slightly with the hand, and fry them a 
fine liffht brown. They may be dished round a shape of plain 
mashed potatoes, or piled on a napkin by themselves. They may 
likewise be rolled in e^ and fine bread-crumbs instead of in the 
vermicelli, or in ground rice, which answers very well for them. 

FOTATO B0ULETTE8. (eNTREMETS.) 

{Good,) 

Boil some good potatoes as dry as possible, or let them be pre- 
pared by Captain Kater^s receipt; mash a pound of them very 
smoothly, and mix with them while they are still warm, two ounces 
of fresh butter, a teaspoonftil of salt, a fittle nutm^, the beaten and 
strained yolks of four e^gs, and last of all the whites thoroughly 
whisked. Mould the mixture with a teaspoon and drop it into a 
small pan of boiling butter, or of very pure lard, and fry the 
bouhttee for five minutes over a moderate fire : they should be of a

fine pale brawii, and veiy light. Drain them well and dish them on 
a hot napkin. 

Potatoes, 1 lb.; butter, 2 oz.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; eggs, 4: 5 
minutes. 

Obs, — These baukties are exceeding light and delicate, and make 
an excellent dish for the second course; but we think that a few 
spoonsful of sweet fresh cream boiled with them until the mixture 
becomes div, would both enrich them and improve their flavour. 
Th^ should be dropped into the pan with the teaspoon, as they 
ought to be small, and they will swell in the cooking. 

POTATO RI8S0LE8. 

{French.) 

Mash and season the potatoes with salt, and white pepper or 
Cayenne, and mix vrith them plenty of minced parsley, and a small 
quantity of green onions, or eschalots ; add sufficient yolks of eggs to 
bind the mixture together, roll it into small balls, and fry them in 
plenty of lard or butter over a moderate fire, or they will be too 
much browned before they are done through. Ham, or any other 
kind of meat finely minced, may be substituted for the herbs, or 
added to them. 

POTATOES A LA MaItRE d'hOTEL. 

Boil in the usual manner some potatoes of a firm kind^ peel, and 
let them cool ; then cut them equally into quarter-inch slices. Dis- 
solve in a very clean stewpan or saucepan from two to four ounces of 
good butter, stir to it a sxnall dessertspoonful of flour, and shake the 
pan over the fire for two or three mmutes ; add by slow d^rees a 
small cupful of boiling water, some pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful 
of minced parsley; put in the potatoes, and toss them gently over a 
clear fire until they are quite hot, and the sauce adheres well to 
them : at the instant of serving add a dessertspoonful of strained 
lemon-juice. Pale veal gravy may be substitutea for the water ; and 
the potatoes after being thickly sliced, may be quickly cut of the 
same size with a small round cutter. 

POTATOES A LA CREME. 

Prepare the potatoes as above, and toss them i 
of a pint or more of thick white sauce or of common < 
or without the addition of the minced parsley. 

KOHL CAKNONy OR KALE CANNON. 

{An Irish Receipt.) 

Mix in about equal proportions (these can be varied to suit the 
convenience of the moment) some smoothly mashed potatoes^ and 



816 MODSBN COOKERY. [gbap. xvh. 

some young sprouts or greens of an^ kind, first boiled quite tender. 
pressed very dry» and chopped a bttle if needful. Alash up the 
whole well together, add a at^^anning of pepper and salt, a snuul bit 
of butter, and a spoonful or two of cream or milk ; put a raw onicn 
into the middle of the mass, and stir it oyer a dear fire until it is 
yery hot, and sufficiently dry to be moulded and turned out lor 
table, or dished in the usual manner. Take out the onion before the 
kohl cannon Ib senred. In Ireland mashed parsneps and potatoes are 
mingled in the same way, and called parsnep camum. A mod 
summer yariety of the preparation is made there also with Windaor 
beans boiled toider, Mkmnea^ and bruised to a paste, then thoroughly 
blended with the potatoes. Turnips, too, are sometimes substitated 
for the jparsneps ; but these or any other watery y^etable should be 
well dried oyer a gentle fire as directed for mashen turnips in this 
chapter, before they are added to the potatoes. 

TO BOn. SEA-KALE. 

Wash, trim, and tie the kale in bunches, and throw it into plenty 
of boiling water with some salt in it. When it is perfectly tender, 
lift it out, drain it well from the water, and send it to table with 
good melted butter. When fashion is not particularly regarded we 
woidd recommend its being seired upon a toast like asparagiu. 
About twenty minutes will boil it, rather less for persons who like it 
crisp. 

18 to 20 minutes. 

SEA-KALE STEWED IK GBATY. (eNTBEMETS.) 

Boil the kale for ten minutes in salt and water ; drain it well, and 
put it into a saucepan with as much good brown grayy as will nearly 
coyer it ; stew it gently for ten minutes or until it is tender, and aen& 
it to table in the grayr yery hot. Another excellent mode of serying 
this y^;etable is, to boil it in salt and water, and to pour oyer it 
plenty of rich white sauce after it is dished 

SPINACH. (^ENTREMETS. 

{French Eeceipt.) 

Pick the spinach leaf by leaf from the stems, and wash it in abun- 
dance of spring water, changing it seyend times ; then shake it in a 
dry cloth held by the four comers, or drain it on a large sieye. 
Throw it into sufficient well-salted boiling water to aUow it to float 
iVeely, and keepit pressed down with a skimmer that it may be 
equally done. When quite joun^ it will be tender in finom eight to 
ten minutes, but to ascertam if it be so, take a leaf and squeen it 
betiveen the fingers. 11' to be dressed in the French mode, drain, and 



CHAF. xm.] TEOETABLE8. 317 

then throw it directly into plenty of firesh water, and when it is cool 
form it into halls and press the moisture thoroughly from it with the 
hands. Next, chop it extremely fine upon a clean trencher ; put two 
ounces (for a large dish) of hutter into a stewpan or hright thick 
saucepan, lay the spinach on it, and keep it stirred oyer a gentle fire 
fixT ten minutes, or until it appears dry; dredge in a spoonful of 
flour, and turn the spinach as it is added ; pour to it gradually, a 
few spoonsful of yery rich yeal grayy, or, if preferred, of good 
boiling cream (with the last of these a dessertspoonful or more of 
pounded sugar may he added for a second-course dish, when the 
true French mode of dressing the yecetahle is liked.) Stew the 
whole hriskly until the liquid is entirely ahsorhed ; di^, and serye 
the spinach yery hot, with small, pale fned sippets round it, or with 
leayes of puffpaste firesh from the oyen, or weU dri^ after hayinff 
been firiecL ¥<>r ornament, the sippets may be fancifully shaped with 
a tin cutter. A proper seasoning of salt must not be omitted in this, 
or any other preparation of the spinach. 

SPINACH A l'aNGLAISE. (eNTRBMBTS.) 

(Or, English fashion) 

Boil the spinach as already directed, and after it has been well 
aqueezed and chopped, stir it oyer a moderate fire until it is yery dry ; 
moisten it with as much thick rich grayy as will flayour it well, and 
turn and stew it quite fast until it is again yery dry ; then press it 
into a hot mould of handsome form, turn it into a cush and serye it 
quickly. Two or three ounces of fresh butter may be laid into the 
saucepan with the spinach at first, as a substitute for the ^yy. 
When a perforated tm shape, ordinarily used for moulding ipmacfa, 
IB not at hand, one of earthenware, slightly buttered, will serye

SPINACH. 

{Conmum English mocie.) 

Boil the spinach yery green in plenty of water, drain, and then 
press the moisture froni it between two trenchers; chop it small, put 
It into a clean saucepan, with a slice of firesh butter, and stir the 
whole until well mixed and yery hot. Smooth it in a dish, mark it 
in dice, and send it quickly to table. 

ANOTHER COMMON ENGLISH RECEIPT FOR SPINACH. 

Take it leaf by leaf firom the stalks, and be yery careful to dear it 
from any weeds that may be amongst it, and to firee it by copious 
and repeated washings from every particle of.sand, or earth. Put 



318 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. XTii. 

it ioto a large weU-tinned stewpan or saucepan, with the -water onl^ 
which hangs ahout it ; throw in a small spoonfnl of salt, and keep it 
constantly pressed down with a wooden spoon, and turned often for 
about a quarter of an hour, or until it is perfectly tender. Drain oS 
the superfluous moisture, chop the spinach quickly on a hot trencher; 
dhh and serve it inunediately. Fried sippets of bread should always 
be served round this v^table, unless it be prepared for an invalid. 

TO DRESS DANDELIONS LIKE SPINACH, OR AS A SALAD. 

(^Very wkoletome.) 

This common weed of the fields and highways is an excellent 
vegetable, the young leaves forming an admirable at^unct to a salad, 
and much resembling endive when boiled and prepared in the same 
way, or in any of the modes directed for spinach. The sli^t bitter^ 
ness of its flavour is to many persons very agreeable ; and it is often 
served at well-appointed tables. It has dso, we believe, the advan- 
tage of possessing valuable medicinal qualities. Take the roots before 
the blossom is at all advanced, if they can readily be found in that 
state ; if not, pluck off and use the youn^ leaves only. Wash them 
as clean as possible, and boil them tender m a large quantity of water 
salted as for sprouts or spinach. Drain them -iveU, press them dry 
with a wooden spoon, and serve them quite plain with melted butter 
in a tureen ; or, squeeze, chop, and heat them afresh, with a season- 
ing of salt and pepper, a morsel of butter rolled in flour, and a 
spoonful or two of gravy or cream. A very large portion of the 
leaves will be requix^ for a dish, as they shrink exceedingly in the 
cooking. For a ralad, take them very young and serve them entire, 
or break them quite small with the fingers ; then wash and drain 
them. Dress them with oil and vinegar, or with any other sauce 
which may be preferred with them 

BOILED TCTRNIP-RADISHEB. 

These should be freshly drawn, young and white. Wash and 
trim them neatly, leaving on two or three of the small inner leaves 
of the top. Boil them in plenty of salted water from twenty to 
thirty minutes, and as soon as they are tender send them to table 
well drained, with melted butter or white sauce. Commdn radishes 
when young, tied in bunches, and lx>iled from eighteen to twenty* 
five minutes, then served on a toast like asparagus, are very good. 

BOILED LEEKS. 

Trim off the coarser leaves from some jowne leeks, cut then into 
equal lengths, tie them into small bunches, and bodl them in plenty 



CSAP. XVII.] YEGETABLES. 319 

of water which has been previously salted and skimmed ; serve them 
on a toast, and send melted batter to table with them 
20 to 25 minutes 

STEWED LETTUCES. 

Strip off the outer leaves, and cut away the stalks; wash the 
lettuces with exceeding nicety, and throw tnem into water salted as 
for all green vegetables. When they are quite tender, which will be 
in from twenty to thirty minutes, according to their ace, liit them 
out and press the water thoroughly from them ; chop Siem a little, 
and heat them in a dean saucepan with a seasoning of pepper and 
salt, and a small slice of butter ; then dredge in a litue flour and stir 
them well; add next a small cup of broth or gravy, boil them 
quickly until they are tolerably dry, then stir in a Httle pale vinegar 
or lemon-juice, and serve them as hot as possible, with fried sippets- 
round them. 

TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. 

With a sharp knife scrape the stems of the asparagus lightly but 
very clean, from within one to two inches of the green tender points ;. 
throw them into cold water as they are done, and when all are ready,. 
tie them in bimches of equal size, cut the large ends evenly, that the- 
asparagus may be all of the same length, and put it into plenty of 
boiling water prepared bj the directions of pa^e 309. Cut a round, 
of br^ quite half an mch thick, and after having pared off the 
crust, toast it a delicate brown on both sides. When the stalks of 
the asparagus are tender, lift it out directly, or it will lose both its^ 
colour and its flavour, and will also be liable to break ; dip the toast 
quickly into the water in which it was boiled, and dish the vegetable 
upon It, with the points meeting in the centre. Send rich melted 
butter to table with it. In France, a small quantity of vinegar is 
stirred into the sauce before it is served ; and many persons like the 
addition. Asparagus may be preserved for a da^ or two sufficiently 
fresh for use, b^ keeping the stalks immersed m an inch-de^th of 
cold water ; but it is never so good as when dressed directly it is cut, 
or within a few hours after 

20 to 25 minutes. 

Ob$. — ^Abroad, boiled asparagus is yery frequently served cold, 
and eaten with oil and vinegar, or a sauce Mayonnaise. 

ASPARAGUS POINTS DRESSED LIKE PEAS. (eNTREMETS. 

This is a convenient mode of dressing asparagus, when it is too 
small and green to make a good appearance plainly boiled. Cut the 
points BO far only as they are penectly tender, in bits of equal size, 
not more than the tiiird of an inch in length > wash them very dean. 



320 MODEBN COOKERY* [CHAF. XTU 

and throw them into plenty of boiling irater, with the usual quantity 
of salt and a few grains of carbonate of soda. When they axe 
tolerably tender, which will be in fh)m ten to twelve minutes, drun 
them well, and spread them on a clean doth ; fold it over them, 
wipe them gently, and when they are quite dry put them into a dean 
Btewpan witn a good slice of butter, wnich should be just dissolved 
before the asparagus is added ; stew them in this over a brisk fire, 
shaking them o&n, for eight or ten minutes; dredge in about a 
small teaspoonful of flour, and add half that quantity of white sugar; 
then pour in boiling water to nearly cover the asparagus, and boil it 
rapidly imtil but little liquid remains : stir in the beaten yolks of 
two eggs, heap the asparagus high in a dish, and serve it veiy hot. 
The sauce should adhere entirely to the vegetable as in green peas 
a la Fran^ise, 

TO BOIL GREEN PEAS. 

To be eaten in perfection these should be young, very fineahly 
gathered, and shelled just befbre they are boiled ; should there lie 
great inequalitv in their size, the smaller ones may be separated from 
the others, and thrown into the ^saucepan four or five minutes later. 
Wash, and drain the peas in a cullender, put them into plenty of 
fast-boiling water, salted bv the directions of page 809 ; keep the pan 
uncovered, and let them boil rapidly until they are tender ; drain 
them well, dish them quickly, and serve them very not, with good 
melted butter in a tureen ; or put a slice of fresh butter into the 
midst of the peas, heap them well over it in the centre of the dish, 
and let it dissolve before they are disturbed. Never, on any aocoont, 
boil or mix mint with them unless it be expressly order«l, as it is 
particularly distasteful to many persons. It should be served in 
small heaps round them, if at all. 

15 to 25 minutes, or more if old,

TO BOIL FRENCH BEANS. 

When the beans are very small and young, merely take off the 
ends and stalks, and drop them into plenty of spring water as they 
are done ; when all are r^y wash and dram them well, throw tiiem 
into a large saucepan of fast-boHing water, salted as usual (see page 
309), and when they are quite tender, which will be in from twdve 
to eighteen minutes, pour them into a cullender, shake the water 
from them, dish, and send them quickly to table with good melted 
batter in a tureen. When from half to two parts grown, cut the 
beans obliquely into a lozenge form, or, when a less modem fashion 
28 preferred, split them lengthwise into delicate strips, and then cut 
them once across : the strings should be drawn off with the tops and 
stalks. No mode of dressmg it can render this vegetable good when 
it is old, but if the sides be pared off, the beans cut thin, and boiled 
tender with rather more than the ordinary proportbn of soda, they 
inll be of excellent colour, and tolerably eatable. 

FRENCH BEANS A LA FRANQAISB. (bNTRBMBTS.) 

Boil, and drain them thoroughly ; then put them into a clean

ounces of fresh butter cut into small bits, some white pepper, a little 
salt, and the juice of half a lemon ; toss them eently for a few 
miniites over a dear fire, and serve them very hot. Should the

TO BOIL WnnMOR BEAMS, 

When young, freshly gathered, and well dressed, these beans, even 
with many persons accustomed to a luxurious table, are a favourite 
aecompaniment to a dish of streaked bacon, or delicate pickled pork. 
Shell them only just before they are wanted, then wash, drain, and 
throw them into boiling water, salted aa fbr peas. When* they sre 
quite tender, pour them into a hot cullender, drain them Uioronghly, 
and send them to table quickly, with a tureen of parsky and biBtfeery 
or with plain melted butter, when it is preferred. A boilad che^ of 
bacon, trimmed f^ ci any blackened parts^ may be dished mfer the 
beans, upon occasion. 

20 to 30 minutes ; less, when very young. 

Oft*.— When the skin of the beans appears wrinkled, they will 
generally be found sufficiently tender to serve, but they should be 
tasted to ascertain that they are so. This v^etable is often skmned 
after it is boiled, and then gently tossed up with a little butter befine 
it is dished. 

DRESSED CUCUMBERS. 

Pare and slice them very thin, strew a little fine salt over them, 
and when they have stood a few minutes, drain off the water, by 
raising one side of the dish, and letting it flow to the other ; poor it 
away, strew more salt^ and a moderate seasoning of l>enper on them, 
add two or three tablcraoonsfrd of the purest salad-oil, and turn the 
cucumbers well, that tne whole may receive a portion of it; thcA 
pour over them from one to three dessertspoonanil of ehili viaq

round into thin ribbons, untQ the watery part is reached : — this is to 
be thrown aside. When all are done, sprinkle them with cayenne and 
fine salt, and leave them to drain a little ; then arrange them lightly 
in a clean dish, and sauce them with very fin^ oil, well mixed with 
chili vinegar, or with equal parts of chili and of .common vinegar. 

Cucumbers, 2 or 3 ; salt, 1 to 2 saltspoonsful ; little cayenne; oil,

them into as much ffood brown gravy as ¥dll nearly cover th^n, ana 
stew them gently from twenty-five to thirty minutes, or until they 
are quite tender. Should the gravy require to be thickened or 
flavoured, dish the cucumbers and keep them hot while a little flour 
and butter, or any other of the usual ingredients, is stirred into it. 
Some persons like a small portion of lemon-juice, or of chili vin^^ 
added to the sauce ; cucumoer vin^ar miffht be substituted for these 
with veiy good effect, as the vegetable loses much of its fine and 
peculiar flavour when cooked. 

25 to 80 minutes.

well-salted boiling water, and simmered for ten minutes, then; 
thoroughly drained upon the back of a sieve, and afteiiwards stewedi 
verv quickly until tender in some highly-flavoured brown gravy, or . 
in tne Spanish sauce of page 101. 

OUCUMBBBS ▲ LA FOULETTE. 

The cncombers for this dish may be pared and diced very ihin;

either case they should be steeped in a little vinegar and sprinkled^ 
with salt for huf an hour before they are dressed. Drain, and then;

fat entirely, add salt and white pepper if needed, and when the 
cucumbers are quite tender, strew in a larse teaspoonfrd of finely*' 
minced parsler, and thidken the sauce with &.e yolks of two or three

MELON. 

This in France and in other parts of the Continent is served and 
eaten with the bouiUi (or heef hoiled tender in the soup-pot), with a 
eeasoniDg of salt and pepper only ; but the fruit is there fax more 
abundant, and of infinitely finer ^wth than with us, and requires so 
little care, companitiYely, that it is planted in many places in the 
open fields, where it flourishes admirably. 

TO BOIL GAULIFLOWEBS. ' 

' Trim off the outside leaves, and cut the stems quite close to the 
cauliflowers ; let them lie for an hour in plenty of cold water with a 
handftil of salt in it, to draw out any insects that may be amongst 
them ; then wash them very thoroughly, and examine them well, to 
be assured that none remain in any part of them ; throw them into a 
large pan of boiling water salted as for asparagus, and quite cleared 
£:om scum ; for this, if not removed, will adhere to the cauliflowers 
and spoil their appearance. When the stalks are tender lift them 
out, dish them neatly, and send good melted butter to table with 
them. 

20 to SO minutes. 

CATJLIFLOWEBS.

Cut the cauliflowers into small handsome tufts, and boil them until 
three parts done, drain them well, toss them for a moment in some 
Aick melted butter or white sauce, and set them by to cool. When 
they are quite cold, dip them separately into the batter of Chapter Y., 
fry them a l^ht brown, arrange them neatly iu a dish, and serve 
them very hot. 

CAULIFLOWERS WITH PABUBSAN CHEESE. 

Take all the green leaves from two or three fine white cauliflowers, 
and cut the stalks off very closely, so that they will stand upright in 
the dish in which they are served ; boil them tolerably tender, but 
not sufiiciently so as to hazard their breaking ; drain them well, and 
dish them, so as to give the whole the appearance of one cauliflower ; 
pour a little good wnite sauce equally over the tops, and on this strew 
grated Parmesan cheese, drop over it a little clarified butter, ada 
another layer of cheese, and cover the whole with the finest bread-

TO BOIL ARTICHOKES. 

After they have been soaked and weU washed, cut off the stems 
quite close, trim away a &w of the lower leaves, and clip the points 
of all; throw the artichokes into plenty of fast-boiling water, ready 
salted and skimmed, with the addition of the proportion of soda 
directed in rage 309, as this will greatly improve the colour of the 
vegetable. When ^remely voung, the artichokes will be tender in 
from half to three quarters of an hour, but they will require moie 
than double th'at time when at their fall growth : when the kavea 
can be drawn out easily they are done. Send good melted butter to 
table with them. They should be boiled always with the stalk-enda 
uppermost.

them eentlv in a Dutch oven, or if more convenient, place them at 
the e&e oi the dripping-pan, taking care that no fat m>m the joint

the gravy with a little arrow-root and cream, or wiui flour and batter, 
and aerve it round them.

and scoop out the inddes; press the pulp through a sieve, aad mix

with it one ounce of fine cnimbs of bread, one of butter broken yezy 
small, some pepper or cayenne, and salt. Fill the tomatas with the 
mixture, and huae them for ten minutes in a moderate OTon ; serve 
them with brown grayy in the dish. A few small mushrooms stewed 
tender in a little butter, then minced and added to the tomata pulp^ 
will Terj much improve this receipt. 
Bake 10 minutes. 

FOSOED TOMATAB. 

(Frendi, Receipt.) 

Let the tomatas be well shaped and of equal size ; diyide them, 
nearl V in the middle leaving the blossom-side the largest, as this only 
is to be used ; empty them carefully of their seeds and juice, and fiU 
them with the following ingredients, which must previously be stewed 
tender in butter but without being allowed to brown : minced mush- 
rooms and shalots, with a moderate proportion of parsley, some lean 
of ham chopped small, a seasoning of cayenne, and a little fine salt, if 
needed ; let them cool, then mix with them about a third as much of 
fine crumbs of bread, and two yolks of eggs ; fill the tomatas, cover 
them with fine crumbs, moisten them with clarified butter, and bake 
them in a brisk oven until they are well coloured. Serve them as a 
ffamish to stewed rump or sirloin of beef, or to a boned and forced 
Jeff of mutton. 

Minced lean of ham, 2 oz. ; mushrooms, 2 oz. ; bread-crumbs, 2 
oz. ; shalots, 4 to 8 ; palrsley, full teaspoonfiil ; cavenne, quarter salt- 
spoonful ; little salt, if neded ; butter, 2 oz. ; yolks of eggs, 2 to 3 : 
baked 10 to 20 minutes. 

Obs.^^The French pound the whole of these ingredients with a bit 
of garlic, before they fiU the tomatas with them, but this is not abso- 
lutely necessary, and the garlic, if added at all, should be parboiled 
first, as its strong flavour, combined with that of the eschalots, would 
scarcely suit the general taste. When the lean of a dressed ham is at 
hand, only the herbs and vegetables will need to be stewed in the 
butter ; this should be mixed with them into the forcemeat^ which an 
intelligent cook will vary in many ways. 

PITBEE or TOMATAS. 

Divide a dozen fine ripe tomatas, squeeze out the seeds, and take off 
the stalks ; put them with one small mild onion (or more, if liked), 
and about half a pint of very good gravy, into a well-tinned stewpaa 
or saucepan, and simmer them for nearly or quite an hour ; a couple 
of bay-leaves, some cayenne, and as much salt as the dish mav requxre, 
should be added when they begin to boil. Press them through a 
sieve, heat them again, and stir to them a quarter of a pint of good 
cream, previously mixed and boiled for five minutes with a teaspoonfiil 



CHAP, xtil] yegetables. 329 

of flour. This pur^e ia to be served with calTs head, veal cutlets, 
boiled knuckle of veal, calTs brains, pr beef palates. For pork, beef| 
geese, and other brown meats, the tomatas should be reduced to a 
proper consistence in rich and highly-flavoured brown gravy, or 
iSpuiiah sauce. 

TO BOIL OREEN INDIAN CORN. 

When still quite green and tender, the ears of maize or Indian com 
are very ffood boilea and served as a vegetable ; and as they will not 
ripen well in this country unless the summer be unusually wann and 
&vourable, it is an advantajgeous mode of turning them to account. 
Strip away the sheath which encloses them, and take ofl* the long 
silken fibres from the tops ; put the com into boiling water salted as 
foT asparagus, and boil it for about half an hour. Drain it well, dish 
it on a toast, and send it to table with melted butter. The Americans, 
who have it served commonly at their tables, use it when more ^lly 
f;Town than we have recommended, and boU it without removing the 
inner leaves of the sheath ; but it is sweeter and more delicate before 
it has reached so advanced a state. The grains may be freed from the 
corn-stalks with a knife, and tossed up with a slice of fresh butter 
and some pep{^r and salt, or served simply like green peas. Other 
modes of dressing the young maize will readily suggest tnemselves to 
an intelligent cook, and our space will not permit us to enumerate 
them. 

25 to 30 minutes. 

MUSHROOMS AU BBURRE. 

(Delicious.) 

Cut the stems from some fine meadow mushroom-buttons, and clean 
them with a bit of new flannel, and some fine salt ; tiien either wipe 
them dry with a soft cloth, or rinse them in fresh water, drain tiiem 

anickly, spread them in a dean cloth, fold it over them, and leave 
tiem for ten minutes, or more, to dry For every pint of them thus 
prepared, put an ounce and a half of fresh butter into a thick iron 
saacepan, shake it over the fire until it Just hegma to brown, throw in 
the mushrooms, continue to shake the saucepan over a dear fire that 
they may not stick to it nor bum, and when they have simmered 
three or four minutes, strew over them a little salt, some cayenne, 
and pounded mace ; stew them until they are perfectly tender, heap 
them in a dish, and serve them with their own sauce only, for break- 
out, supper, or luncheon. Nothing can be finer than the flavour of 
the mushrooms thus prepared ; and tiie addition of any liquid is far 
from an improvement to it. They are very cood when diidned from 
the butter, and served cold, and in a cool larder may be kept for 
Beveral days. The butter in which they are stewed is admirable for 
flayoaring gravies, sauces, or potted meats. Small flaps, freed from 



330 MODEBH COOKERY. [csAP. Xfli. 

the fur axkd skia, may be stewed in the same way; and either tibeie, 
or the buttons, serv^ under roast poultxy or partridges, will gi\re a 
dish of very superior reli^. 

M«idow mushrooms, 3 pints, fresh butter 41 oz. : 3 to 5 nmmtes. 
Salt, 1 small teadpoonful ; mace, half as much ; cayenne, third of 
saltspoonM : 10 to 15 minutes. More spices to be added if required 
— much depending on their quality; but they should not overpower 
the flavour of the mushrooms. 

06«.— Persons inhabiting parts of the country where mushrooms 
are abundant, may send them easily, when thus prepared (or when 
potted by the following receipt), to their friends m cities, or in less 
productive counties, if poured into jars, with sufficient butter to 
cover them, they will travel any distance, and can be re-wacmed for 
use. 

POTTED MUSHROOMS. 

Prepare either small flaps or buttons witili great nioety, without 
wetting Ihem, and wipe the former very dry, after the appHeation of 
the salt and flannel. Stew them quite tender, with the same propor- 
tion of butter as the mushrooms an bettrre, but increase a little the 
quantity of spce ; when they are done turn them into a large dish, 
spread them over one end of it, and raise it two or three inches that 
they may be well drained from the butter. As soon m they aie 
quite cold, press them very closely into small potting-pans; j^oor 
lukewarm clarifled but&r thickly over them, and store them m a 
cool dry place. If intended for present use, merely turn them down 
upon a clean shelf; but for longer keeping cover the tops first with 
very dry paper, and then with melted mutton-suet. We have our- 
selves had the mushrooms, after being simply spread upon a dish 
while hot, remain perfectly good in tiiat state for seven or eight 
weeks : they were prepared kte in the seascm, and the weather was 
eousequently oool during the interval.

TRUFFLES AND THEIR USES. 

The trufile, or underground mushroom, as it has sometimes been 
called, is held in almost eztrayagant estimation by epicures,* and 
enters largely into what may be termed first-class cookery, both in 
England and abroad ; though it is mHch less generally known and 
used here than in France, Germany, and other parts of the Continent, 
where it is far more abundant, and of yery saperior quality. 

As it is in constant demand for Inxuriously-seryea tables, and has 
hitherto, we belieye, baffled all atteinpts to increase it by cultiyation, 
H bears usually a high price in the English market,t and is seldom 
to be had cheap in any ; but although too costly for common con- 
RUDptiQn, where the expenditure is regulated by rational economy, 
it may at times be made to supply, at a reasonable expense, some 
ezoeilent store-prenarations for tne breakfast and lunche<»i-table ; as 
a small portion will impart its peculiar flayour to them. 

The blai^est truffles are considered the best All are in their 
perfection during the latter part of Noyember, December, and 
January ; though they may be procured usually from October to 
Harch; yet as they are peculiarly subject to decay— or, properly 
speaking, become really putrid— from exposure to the air, it is an 
adyantage to haye them as early in their season as may be. 

In sumptuous households the yery finest foreign truffles are often 
•eryed om a vegetabie in the second course.

TO PBBPARB TRUFFLES FOB USB. 

First soak them for an hour or two in fi^sh water, to loosen the 
earth which adheres to them ; then rinse them well from it, and with 
a hard brush scrub them until not a particle of the mould in which 
lliey have been embedded can be seen upon them. This part of the 
operation should be especially attended to, because the parings are as 
useful as the truffles themselyes. It is often needful to leave them 
longer in the water after it has been changed ; and even to soak them 
sometimes in lukewarm water also : when they tue perfectly cleaned, 
wipe them gently with a soft cloth, or fold them in to diy, should 
they be wanted for any preparation to which moisture would be 
injurious.

them well with cold water only, change it several times, and when 
they are perfectly clean line a stewpan with slices of bacon ; put in 
the truffles with a bunch of parsley, green onions, and thyme, two or 
three bay-leaves, half a dozen doves, and a little sweet basil ; pour in 
sufficient rich veisJ gravy to cover them, with the addition of from 
half a pint to half a bottle of champagne ; boil them very sofUy fixr 
an hour, then draw them aside and let them cool in the gravy 
Heat them afr'esh in it when they are wanted for table ; lift them out 
and drain them in a veiy dean cloth, and dish them nettly in a fine 
and beautifully white napkin, which will contrast as strongly as pos- 
sible with the dark hue of the truffles.

eveiy precaution taken to prevent the smoke from reaching its con-

washing before they are boiled ; but savoys, large lettuces, and dose- 
leaved cabbages should be thrown into salt and water for half an hour 
or more before they are dressed, with the tops downwards to draw out 
the insects. The stems of these last should be cut off, the decayed 
leaves stripped away, and the v^etable halved or quaxtered, or split

to serve. Turnip-greens should be well washed in several waters, and 
Ixxiled in a very hu-ge quantity to deprive them of their bitterness. 

STEWED CABBAQE. 

Cot out the stalk entirely, and slice a fine firm cabbage or two in 
ver^ thin strips ; throw them after they have been well washed and 
dramed, into a large pan of boilmg water ready salted and skimmed, 
and when they are tender, which will be in f^om ten to fifteen 
minutes, pour tLem into a sieve or strainer, press the water thoroughly 
from them, and chop them slightly. Put mto a very clean saucepan 
about a couple of ounces of butter, and when it is mssolved add the 
cabbage with sufficient pepper and salt to season it, and stir it over a 
dear fire until it appears tolerably drv; then shake lightly in a 
tablespoonfhl of flour, turn the whole well, and add by slow degrees a 
cap of thick cream : veal gravy or good white sauce may be sub- 
stituted for this, when preferred to it.

Fare entirely from them the fibrous rind, and either split the 
turnips once or leave them whole; throw them into boiling water 
alighUy salted, and keep them dosely covered firom smoke and dust 
untfl they are tender. When, small and young they will be done in 
tcom fifteen to twenty minutes ; at their fim growth they will require 
from three quarters to a fhll hour, or more, of gentle boiling. After 
they become old and woolly they are not worth drening in any way.

to pass them throtifh a collender or coarse hair-sieye, with a wooden 
spoon ; though, when quite young, ther may be worked sufficient 
smooth without this, rut them into a clean saucepan, and stir them 
constantly for some minutes over a sentle fire, that they may be very 
diy ; then add some salt, a bit of fiesh butter, and a little cream, or 
in lieu of this new milk (we would also recommend a seasoning of 
white pepper or cayenne, when appearance and fiishion are not par- 
ticularly regarded), and continue to simmer and to stir them fbr five 
or six minutes longer, or until they have quite absorbed all the lii|aid 
which has been poured to them. Serve them alwa^ as hot as 
possible. This is an excellent receipt ; but the addition of a little 
good white sauce would render it still better. 

Turnips, weighed after they are pared, 3 lbs. : dried 5 to 8 minute. 
Salt, 1 teaspoonful ; butter, 1 oz. to 1^ oz. ; cream or milk, nearly i

TTmiaPS IK WHITB BXVCE. (ENTREMETS.) 

When no scoop for the purpose is at haad, cut some small findy- 
ffrained turnips into quarters, and pare them into balls, or into me 
stkttpe of plums or pears of equal size; arrange them evenly in a 
broad stewpan or saucepan, and cover them nearly with good veal 
broth, throw in a little salt, and a morsel of sugar, and toU them 
rather quickly until they are quite tender, but preserve them un- 
broken ; lift them out, draining them well from the broth ; Suk, and 
•poxa over them some thick white sauce. Aa an economy, a dtp of 
cream, and a teaspoonful of arrowroot, may be added to the brodi 
in which the turmps have stewed, to make the sauce ; and when it 
boils, a small slice of butter may be stirred and well worked into it, 
should it not be sufficiently rich without. 

TURNIPS STEWED IN BUTTER. (OOOD.) 

This is an excellent way of dressing the v^table when it is mild 
and finely grained ; but its flavour otherwise is too strong to be 
agreeable. After they have been washed, wiped quite dxy, and pared, 
slice the turnips neany half an inch thick, and divide them into dice, 
Just dissolve an ounce of butter for each half-poimd of the turnips, 
put them in as flat as they can be, and stew them very gently indeed, 
from three quarters of an hour to a full hour. Add a seasoning or 
salt and white pepper when they are half done. When thus pre- 
pared, they may be dished in tne centre of fiied or nicely bitnled 
mutton cutlets, or served by themselves. 

For a small dish : turnips, 1^ lb. ; butter, 3 oz. ; seasoning of white

To s paand of turnips sliced and cnt into dice, poor a quarter of a 
pint of boiling real grayy, add a small Inmp of sugar, some salt and 
cayenne, or \viiite pepper, and boil them quickly firom fifty to sixty 
mmutes. Serve them very hot. 

TO BOIL CABROTS. 

Wash the mould from them, and scrape the skin off lightly with 
the edge of a sharp knife, or, ^ould this be objected to, pare them as 
thin and as equally as possible; in either case free them from all 
bkmishefl, and riiiould thejf be rery laree, divide them, and cut the 
thick parts into quarters ; rinse them if ell, and throw them into plenty 
of boiling water with some salt in it. The skin of very young carrots 
may be rubbed off like that of new potatoes, and from twenty to 
thirty minutes will then be sufficient to boil them ; but at their fbll 
growth th^ will require from an hour and a half to two hours. It 
was formerly the custom to tie them in a doth, and to wipe the skin 
fixnn them with it after they were dressed ; and old-fashioned cooks 
Btill use one to remove it ; but all vegetables should, we think, be 
dished and served with the least possible delay after they are ready for 
table. Melted butter should accompany boiled carrots. 

Very young carrots, 20 to 30 minutes. Full-grown ones, li to 2 
hours. 

CARROTS. (ENTRis.) 
(^The Windsor Receipt) 

Select some good carrots of equal size, and cut the upper parts into 
eren lengths of about two inches and a hal^ then tnm one end of 
each into a point, so as to give the carrot the form of a sugar-loaf.* 
When all are ready, throw them into plen^ of ready-salted boiline 
water, and boil them three quarters of an hour. Lift them out, and 
drain them well, then arrange them upright, and all on a level in a 
broad stewpan or saucepan, and pour m good hot beef-broth or veal- 
gravy to half their height ; add as much salt as ma^ be needed, and a 
small teaspoonful of sugar, and boil them briskly for half an hour, or 
longer, should they require it. Place them seam upright in dishing 
them, and keep tnem hot while a little good brown gravy is thick- 
ened to pour over them, fuad mixed with a large teaspoonful of pars- 
ley and a little lemon-juice ; or sauce them with conunon bechatnel

this, and thickened with butter and a little flour. 

SWEET CARROTS. (ENTREMETS.) 

Boil quite tender some fine hiffhly-flavoured carrots, press the 
water from them, and rub them uirough the back of a fine hair- 
sieve; put them into a clean saucepan or stewpan, and dry them 
thoroughly over a gentle fire ; then add a slice of firesh butter, and 
when this is dissolved and well mixed with them, strew in a dessert- 
spoonM or more of powdered sugar, and a little salt ; next, stir in by 
oegrees some good cream, and when this is quite absorbed, and the 
carrots again appear dry, dish and serve them quickly with small 
sippets a Ja Reine (see page 5), placed round them.

Prenare some finely flavoured carrots as above, and dry them over 
a ^ntle fire like mashed turnips ; then for a dish of moderate sise 
mix well with them fix>m two to three ounces of good butter, cut 
into small bits, keeping them toeU sHrred. Add a seasoning of salt 
and cayenne, and serve them ver^ hot, garnished or not at pleasure

CARROTS AIT BBURRE, OR BUTTERED CARROTS. 

(French.) 

Either boil sufficient carrots for a dish quite tender, and then 
cut them into slices a quarter of an inch thick, or first slice, and then 
boil them : the latter method is the most expeditious, but the other 
best preserves the flavour of the yegetable. Drain them well, and 
while this is being done just dissolve firom two to three ounces of 
butter in a saucepan, and strew in some minced parsley, some salt, 
and white pepper x cayenne; then add the camrtSi and toss them

should not be allowed to boil : the pareW may be omitted a^ 
pleasure. Cold carrots may be rewarmed in this way. 

CARROTS IN THEIR OWN JUICE. 

(A nmpie but excellent Beceipt) 

By the following mode of dressing carrots, whether young or old, 
tbeir fiill flavour and all the nutnment they contain are entirely 
preaeryed ; and they are at the same time rendered so palatable by it 
that they furnish at once an admirable dish to eat without meat, as 
well as with it. Wash the roots yery clean, and scrape or lightly 
pare them, cutting out any discoloured parts. Haye ready boiling and 
salted, as much water as will coyer tnem ; slice them rather uiick, 
throw them into it, and should there be more than sufficient to just 
Jloat them Tand barely that), pour it away. Boil them genUy until 
they are tolerably tender, and then yeiy qtdckly, to eyaporate the 
water, of which only a spoonful or so should be left in the saucepan. 
Dust a seasoning of pepper on them, throw in a morsel of butter rollecl 
in flour, and turn and toss them gently untQ their juice is thickened by 
them and adheres to the roots. Send them immediately to table. They 
are excellent without any addition but the pepper ; though they may 
be in many ways improved. A dessert-spoonftil of mmced parsley 
maybe strewed over them when the butter is added, and a little thick 
cream mixed with a small proportion of flour to prevent its curdling, 
may be strewed amongst tnem, or a spoonful or two of good gravy. 

TO BOIL PARSNEFS. 

These are dressed in precisely the same manner as carrots, but 
require much less boiling. According to their quality and the time 
of year, they will take from twen^ minutes to nearly an hour. 
Every speck or blemish should be cut team them after they are 
scraped, and the water in which they are boiled should be wdl 
skimmed They are a favourite accompaniment to salt fish and 
boiled pork, and may be served either mashed or plain. 

20 to 25 minutes. 

FRIED PARSNEPS* 

Bml them until they are about half done, lift them out, and let 
them cool; slice them rather thickly, sprinkle them with fine salt 
and white pepper, and firy them a pale brown in good butter. Serve 
them with roast meat, or dish them under it 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES.

water; and when they are ahoat half boiled add a little salt to them. 
Take them up the instant they are perfectly tender : this will he in 
£rom fifteen to twenty-fiye minutes, so much do they vary in sixe and 
as to the time necessaiy to dress them. K allowed to remain in the 
water affcer they are done, they become black and flayonrlesB. 
Melted butter should always be sent to table with them* 
15 to 25 minutes. 

TO FRY JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES (eNTREMETB.) 

Boil them from ei^ht to twelve minutes ; lift them out, drain than

MASHBD JEBUBALSM ARTICHOKES. 

Boil them tender, press the water well from them, and then

HARICOTS BLANCS. 

The haricot hkmc is the seed of a particolar kind of French bean,, 
of which we find some difficulty in aacertainmg the English name^ 
for though we have tried aeveiiu which resemMed it in appeannoe, 
we have found their flavour, Kto they were dresaed, very different^ 
and far from agreeable. The Ixt^ white Dutch rnnner, n, we

bofling water, mth some salt and a small bit of butter; if dry, they 
must be previously soaked for an hour or two, put into cold water, 
brought to boil gently, and simmered until they are tender, for if 
boilea fast the skins -mil burst before the beans are done. Drain 
them thoroughly from the water when they are ready, and lay them 
into a clean saucepan over two or three ounces of fresh butter, a 
flmaU dessertspoonful of chopped parsley, and sufficient salt and 
pepper to season the whole; then gently shake or toss the beans 
until the^ are quite hot and equally covered with the sauce ; add the 
strained juice of half a lemon, and serve them quickly. The vege- 
table thus dressed, is excellent; and it affords a convenient resource 
in the season when the supply of other kinds is scantiest. In some 
sountries the dried beans are placed in water, over-night, upon a 
stove, and by a very sentle degree of warmth are sufficiently soft- 
ened by the following day to be served as follows :— they are trained 
from the water, spr^ on a dean cloth and wiped qmte diy, then 
lightly floured and fried in oil or butter, with a seasoning of pepper 
and salt, lifted into a hot dishi and served under roast beet, or 
mutton. 

TO BOIL BEET BOOT* 

Wash the roots delicately clean, but neither scrape nor cut them^ ' 
for should even the small fibres be taken off before they are cooked, 
their beautiful colour would be much injured. Throw them into 
boiling water, and, according to thdr size, which varies greatlv, as 
they arc sometimes of enormous growth, boU them firom one hour 
and a half to two and a half, or longer if requisite. Fare and serve 
them whole, or cut into thick slices and neatly dished in a close 
circle : send melted butter to table with them. Cold red beet root is 
often intermingled with other ve^tables for winter salads ; and it 
makes a pickle of remarkably brilliant hue. A common mode of 
serving it at the present day is in the last course of a dinner with the 
cheese : it is merely pai«a and sliced afier having been baked or 
boiled tender. 

.1} to 2) hours, or longer* 

TO BAKE BEET BOOT. 

Beet root if slowly and carefolly baked until it is tender quite 
iliiough, is very rich and sweet in flavour, although less bright in 
colour than when it is boiled : it Is also, we believe, remairkably 
nutritious and wholesome. Wash and wipe it very dry, but neither 
cat nor break any part of it ; then lay it mto a coarse earthen dish, 
and bake it in a gentle oven for four or five hours : it will sometimes 
require even a longer time than this. Pare it quickly if it be serreA 
hot ; but leave it to cool first, when it is to be sent to table cdUL 

In slow oven firam 4 to 6 hours. 



340 HODEBN COOKEBT. [cHAP.zra. 



STEWED BEET ROOT* 

Bake or boil it tolerably tender, and let it remain until it is cold, 
then pare and cut it into slices ; heat and stew it for a short time in 
some good pale veal gfayy (or in strong yeal broth for ordinary 
occasions), tnicken this with a teaspoonful of arrowroot, and half a 
cupM or more of good cream, and stir in, as it is taken from the 
fire, from a tea to a tablespoonful of chili vinegar. The beet root 
may be served likewise in tnick white sauce, to which, just before it 
is dished, the mild eschalot! of page 128 may be added. 



TO STEW BED OABBAOE. 

(Flemith Receipt,) 

Strip the outer leaves from a fine and fi^h red cabbage; wash it 
well, and cut it into the thinnest possible slices, b^inning at the 
top ; put it into a thick saucepan m which two or three ounces of 
good. Dutter have been just dissolved ; add some pepper and salt^ and 
stew it very slowly indeed for three or four hours m its own juice, 
keeping it often stirred, and well pressed down. When it is per- 
fectly tender add a tablespoonM of vinegu- ; mix the whole up 
thoroughly, heap the cabbase in a hot dish, and serve broUed 
sausages round it; or omit these last, and substitute lemon-jniee^ 
cayenne pepper, and a half-cupful of good gravy. 

The stalk of the cabbage should JSe sput in quarters and taken 
entirely out in the first instance. 

S to 4 hours. 

BRUSSELS 8PB017T8. 

These delicate little sprouts, or miniature cabbages, which at thdr 
frillest growth scarcely exceed a laige walnut in sice, should be quite 
freshly gathered. Free them frtnn aU discoloured leaves, cut the 
stems even, and wash the sprouts thoroughly. Throw them into 
a pan of water properly salted, and boil them quickly from eight to 
ten minutes ; dxain them to«ZZ, and serve them upon a rather thick 
round of toasted bread buttered on both sides. Send eood melted 
butter to table with them. This is the Belgian mode of aremng this 
excellent vegetable, which is served in France with the sauce poured 
over it, or it is tossed in a stewpan with a slice of butter and some 
pepper and salt : a spoonM or two of veal gravy (and sometimes a 
little lemon-juice) is added when these are pmectly mixed.

SALSIFY. 

We are surprised that a y^etable so excellent as this should be so 
litUe cared for in England. Delicately fried in batter— which is a 
common mode of servinff it abroad— it forms a delicious second 
course dish : it is also good when plain-boiled, drained, and served in 
grayr, or even with melted butter. Wash the roots, scrape gently 
off the dark outside skin, and throw them into cold water as they are 
done, to jprevent their turning black ; cut them into lengths of three 
or four mches, and when all are ready put them into plenty of 
boiling water with a little salt, a small bit of butter, and a couple of 

rnSul of white yinegar or the juice of a lemon : thev will be 
I in from three quarters of an hour to an hour. Try them with 
a fork, and when perfectly tender, drain, and serye them wiUi white 
sauce, rich brown grayy, or melted butter. 
) to 1 hour. 

FBIED SALSIFY. (eNTBEHETS.) 

Boil the salsify tender, as directed aboye, drain, and then press it 
lightly in a soft doth. Make some French batter (see Chapter Y.), 
t£row the bits of salsify into it, take them out separately, and fry 
them a light brown, drain them well from the fat, sprixikle a little 
fine salt oyer them after they are dished, and serye them quickly. 
At English tables, salsify occasionally makes its appearance fried with 
egg and bread-crumbs instead of batter. Scorgonera is dressed in 
predsely the same manner as the salsify. 

BOILED CELERY. 

This yegetable is extremely good dressed like sea-kale, and seryed 
on a toast with rich melted butter. Let it be freshly duff, wash it 
with great nicety, trim the ends, take off the coarse outer-Teayes, cut 
the roots of equal leneth, tie them in bunches, and boil them in 
plenty of water, with dxe usual proportion of «ilt, from twenty to 
thirty minutes. 

20 to 30 minutes. 

STEWED CELERY. 

Cut fiye or six fine roots of celery to the length of the inside of 
the dish in which they are to be seryed ; free them from all the 
coarser leayes, and from the green tops, trim the root ends neatly, 
and wash the yegetable in seyeral waters until it is as dean as pos- 
sible ; then, either boQ it tender with a little salt, and a bit of fredi 
butter the size of a walnut, in just suffident water to coyer it quit% 



342 MODSSK COOKSBT. [cHAP.XTO. 

drain it well, arrange it on a very hot dish, and ponr a thick 
hechamel, or white sauce over it; or stew it in hrotn or common 
stock, and serve it with very rich, thickened, Espagnole or brown 
gravy. It has a higher flavour when partially stewed in the sauce, 
after being drained thoroughly from the broth. Unless very large 
and old, it will be done in from twenty-five to thirty minutes, but if 
not quite tender, longer time must be allowed for it. A cheap and 
expeditious method of preparing this dish is to slice the celery, to 
simmer it until soft in as much good broth as will only just cover iky 
and to add a thickening of flour and butter, or arrow-root, with, some 
salt, pepper, and a smdl cupM of cream. 
25 to 30 minutes, or more^ 

8TSWED OniONS. 

Strip the outer skin from four or five fine Portugal omoDS, and 
trim the ends, but without cutting into the vegetable; arrange 
them in a saucepan of sufficient size to contain them all in one layer, 
just cover them with good beef or veal gravy, and stew them very 
gently indeed for a couple of hours : thev should be tender quite 
tnrough, but should not be allowed to fail to pieces. When large, 
but not mild onions are used, they should be first boiled for half an 
hour in plenty of water, then drained from it, and put into bculiiig 
gravy : strong, well-flavoured broth of veal or beef, is sometimei 
substituted for this, and with the addition of a little catsup, spice, 
and thickening, answers very welL The savour of this dish is 
heightened by flouring lightly and frying the onions of a pale brown 
before they are stewed. 

Portugal onions, 4 or 5 (if fried, 15 to 20 minutes) ; broth or 
gravy, 1 to U pint : nearly or quite 2 hours. 

Obs. — When the quantity of gravy is considered too much, the 
onions may be only half covered, and turned when the under side k 
tender, but longer time must then be allowed for stewing them 

8TBWED CHBSTNUTS* 

Strip the outer rind from forty or fifty fine sound Spanish cheat* 
nuts, throw them into a large saucepan of hot water, and bring h to 
the point of boiling ; when the second skin puts fh>m them easily, 
lift them out, and throw them into plenty or cold water ; peel, and 
wipe them drv ; then put them into a stewpan or bright saucepan, 
with as much hishly-flavoured coM beef or veal gravy as will neariy 
cover them, ana stew them very gently firom three-qiiarters of an 
hour to a full hour: they should be quite tender, bat unbroken. 
Add salt, cayenne, and thickening if required, and serve the chest- 
nuts in their gravy. We have found it an inrorovement to have 
them floured and tightly browned in a little good butter before thegr 



6HAP. xm.] TISQETABLSS. 343 

are stewed, and also to add some thin strips of fresh lemon-rind to 
ihe gravy. 

Chestnuts, 40 or 50 ; gravy, f pint, or more : f to 1 hour. 

Obs. — A couple of bay-leaves and a slice of lean ham wiU five an 
improved flavour to the sauce should it not be sufficiently liai : the 
ham should be laid under the chestnuts, but not served with them. 
When these are to be browned, or even otherwise, they may be freed 
readily from the second skin by shaking them with a small bit of 
butter in a frying-pan over a gentle fire.

nrmoDUCTORY remarks. 

The greatest possible cleanliness and nicety should be observed in 
making pastry. The slab or board, paste-rollers, tins, catters, 
moulds, everything, in fact, used for it, 
and especially the hands, should be ^ 
equally free from the slightest soil or 
Xwrticle of dust. The more expedi- 
tiously the finer kinds of paste are made . 
and despatched to the oven, and the [ 
less they are touched the better. Much . 
of their excellence depends upon the 
baking also. They should have a suf- 
ficient degree of heat to raise them 
quickly, but not so fierce a one as to colour them too much before 
tney are done, and still less to bum them. The oven door should remain 
closed after they are put in, and not removed until the paste is set. 
Large raised pies require a steadily sustained, or, what is technically 
call^ a soaking heat, and to ensure this the oven should be made very 




Raised Pie Mould. 



OHAP. xvnLj PASTBT. 345 

hot, then cleared, and closely shut from half to a whole honr hefore it 
is used, to concentrate the heat. It is an advantage in this case to have 
a large log or two of cord- wood homed in it, in addition to the nsual 
fuel. 

In mixing paste, the water should he added gradually, and the 
whole gently drawn together with the fingers, until sufficient has 
heen added, when it shoidd he lightly kneaided until it is as smooth 
as possihle. When carelessly made, the surface is often left covered 
with small dry crumhs or lumps ; or tiie water is poured in heed- 
lessly in so lai^e a proportion that it hecomes necessary to add more 
flour to render it workable in any way ; and this ought particularly 
to he avoided when a certain weight of all the ingredients has heen 
taken. 

TO GLAZE OB ICE PASTRY.* 

The fine yellow glaze appropriate to meat pies is given with heaten 
volk of egff, which should he laid on with a paste hrush, or a small 
hunch of leathers : if a lighter colour he wished for, whisk the whole 
of the ^;g together, or mix a little milk with the yolk. 

The hest mode of idng fruit-tarts hefore they are sent to the oven 
is, to moisten the paste with cold water, to sift sugar thickly upon it, 
and to press it ligntly on with the hand ; hut when a whiter icing is 
preferred, the pastry must be drawn from the oven when nearly 
baked, and brushed with white of egg, wisked to a froth ; then well 
covered with the sifted su^, and sprinkled with a few drops of 
water before it is put in again : this glazing answers also very well, 
though it takes a slight colour, if mbA before the pastry is baked. 

FEUILLETAGB, OR FINE FBENCH PUFF PASTE. 

This, when made b^ a good French cook, is the •perfection of rich 
light paste, and will nse in the oven from one to six inches in height ; 
but some practice is, without doubt, necessary to accomplish this. In 
summer it is a great advantage to have ice at hand, and to harden 
the butter over it before it is used ; the paste also between the in- 
tervals of rolling is improved by bein^ laid on an oven-leaf over a 
vessel containing it. Take an equal weight of good butter free from 
the coarse salt which is found in some, and which is disadvantageous 
for this paste, and of fine dry, sifted flour ; to each pound of these 
allow the volks of a couple of eggs, and a small teaspoonful of salt. 
Break a few small bits of the butter very lightly mto the flour, put 
the salt into the centre, and pour on it sufficient water to dissolve it 
(we do not understand why the doing this should be better than 
wiiTing it with the flour, as in other pastes, bul such is the method 
always pursued for it) ; add a little more water to the eggs, moisten 
the flour gradually, and make it into a very smooth paste, rather

lithe in imniDer, and nerer exceedingly stiff, thongh the moaite 
&ult, in the extreme, would render the crust unmanageable. Press, 
in a soft thin cloth, all the moisture from the remainder of the butter, 
and form it into a ball, but in doing this be careful not to soften it too 
much. Should it be in an unfit state for pastry from the heat of the 
weather, put it into a basin, and set the basin into a pan of water 
mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre, and let it remain in a cool 
place for an hour if possible before it is used. When it is ready (and 
the paste should never be commenced until it is so), roll the crust out 
square,* and of sufficient size to enclose the butter, flatten this a little 
upon it in the centre, and then fold the crust well over it, and roll it 
out thin as lightly as possible, after bavins dredged the board and 
paste roller with a little flour: this is culed giving it one hanu 
Then fold it in three, give it another turn, and set it aside where it 
will be very cool, for a few minutes; nve it two more turns in the 
same way, rollii^; it each time very lightly but of equal thickness, 
and to the full leusth thAt it will reach, taJdog always especial care 
that the butter shafi not break through the pa^.. Let it again be 
set aside to become cold ; and after it has been twice more roUed and 
folded in three, give it a half turn, by folding it once only, and it 
will be read^ for use. 

Equal weight of the finest flour and good butter ; to each pound of

VERY GOOD LIGHT PASTB. 

Mix with a pound of sifted flour six ounces of fresh, pure lard, 
and make them into a smooth paste with cold water ; press the but- 
termilk from ten ounces of butter, and form it into a ball, by twisting 
it in a dean cloth. BoU out the paste, put the ball of butter in the 
middle, close it like an apple-dumpling, and roll it very lightly until 
it is less than an inch thick ; fold the ends into the middle, dust a 
little flour over the board and paste-roller, and roll the paste thin a 
second time, then set it aside for three or four minutes in a very cool 
place ; give it two more turns, after it has again been left for a few 
minutes, roll it out twice more, folding it each time in three. This 
ought to render it fit for use. The sooner this naste is sent to the 
oven after it is made, the lighter it wiU be : if allowed to remain 
long before it is baked, it will be tough and heavy.

CREAM CRUST. 

(Avihor^s Receipt. Very good^ 

Stir a little fine salt into a pound of dry flour, and mix gradually 
with it sufficient yerj thick, sweet cream to form a smooth paste ; it 
will be found sufficiently good for common family dinners, without 
the addition of batter; but to make an exoeUent crust, roll in four 
oonoes in the usual way, after haying giyen the paste a couple ot

and make them into a firm paiste, with the yolks of four eggs, well 
beaten, mixed with half a pmt of cold water, and strained ; or for a 
Bomewhat richer crust of the same kind, take two pounds of flour,

after it is melted into lard. Clear it quite from skm, and slice it yexy 
thin into the flour, add sufficient salt to give flavour to the paste. 
and make the whole up smooth and firm with cold water ; lay it on 
a dean dresser, and beat it forcibly with a rolling-pin xmtil the flead 
is blended perfectly with the flour. It may then be made into cakes 
with a paste-cutter, or used for pies, round the edges of which a knife 
should be passed, as the crust rises better when cut than if merely, 
rolled to the proper size. With the addition of a small quantity of 
butter, which may either be broken into the flour before the flead is 
mixed with it, or rolled into the paste after it is beaten, it wHl be 
found equal to fine puff crust, with the advantage of being more easy 
of digestion. 

Quite common crust : flour, 1} lb. ; flead, 8 oz. ; salt, 1 small tea- 
spoonful. Good common crust : flour, 1 lb. ; flead, 6 oz. ; batter, 2

COMMON SUET-CRUST FOR PIES. 

In many families this is preferred both for pies and tarts, to cmst 
made with butter, as being much more wholesome; but it should 
never be served unless especially ordered, as it is to some persons 
peculiarly distasteful. Chop the suet extremely small, and add froth 
six to eignt ounces of it to a pound of flour, with a few grains of salt ; 
mix these with cold water into a firm paste, and work it veiy smooth. 
Some cooks beat it with a paste-roller, until the suet is perfectly 
blended with flour ; but the crust is lighter without this. In exceed- 
ingly sultry weather the suet, not being firm enough to chop, may be 
sbced as tmn as possible, and well beaten into the paste after it is 
worked up. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; beef or veal kidney-suet, 12 to 16 oz. ; salt (for 
fruit-pies), i teaspoonfrd, for meat-pies, 1 teaspoonful. 

VERY SUPERIOR SUET- CRUST. 

Strip the skin entirely from some fredi veal or beef kidney-suet ; 
chop, and then put it into the mortar, with a small quantity of pnze- 
flavoured lard, oil, or butter, and pound it perfectly smoodb : it may 
then be used for crust in the same way that butter is, in mitHng 

Jmff-paste, and in this form wiU be found a most excellent substitute 
or it, for ?u>t pies or tarts. It is not quite so good for those whiclr 
are to be served cold. Eight oimces of suet pounded with two of 
butter, and worked with the fingers into a pound of flour, will make 
an exceedingly ^ood short crust ; but for a very rich one the pro- 
portion must be increased. 

Good short crust: flour, 1 lb. ; suet, 8 oz.; batter, 2 oz. ; salt, }

TEBT BICH SHORT CBUBT FOR TARTS. 

Break ligbily, with the least poBsible handling, six ounces of 
batter into eight of flour ; add a dessertspoonful of pounded sugar, 
and two or three of water ; roll the paste, for several minutes, to 
blend the ingredients well, folding it together like puff-crust, and 
touch it as little as possible. 

Flour, 8 oz. ; butter, 6 oz. ; pounded sugar, 1 dessertspoonful {

BXOELLENT SHORT 0RU6T FOR SWEET PASTRY. 

Crumble down yery lightly half a pound of butter into a pound of 
flour, breaking it quite smaU. Mix well with these a slight pinch of 
salt and two ounces of sifted sugar, and add sufficient milk to make 
them up into a very smooth and somewhat firm paste. Bake this 
slowly, and keep it pale. It will be found an admirable crust if well 
made and lightly handled, and will answer for many dishes much 
better than pufif-paste. It mU, rise in the oyen too, and be extremely 
light Ten ounces of butter wiU render it very rich, but we find 
eight quite sufficient. 

BRIOCHE PASTE* 

The brioche is a rich, light kind of unsweetened bun or cake, very 
commonly sold, and sery^ to all classes of people in France, where 
it is made in great perfection by good cooks ana pastrycooks. It is 
fashionable now at English tables, though in a different form, seryin^^ 
prindpallyas a crust to enclose rissoles^ or to make cannelons and 
mtters. We haye seen it recommended for a vol-au-vent^ for which 
we should say it does not answer by any means so well as the fine 
pufiT-paste called feutUetage, The large proportion of butter and 
eggs which it contains render it to many persons highly indigestible ; 
and we mention this to warn inyalids against it, as we haye known 
it to cause great suffering to persons out of health. To make it, take 
a couple of pounds* of fine dry flour, sifted as for cakes, and separate 
d^ht ounces of this from the remainder to make the leayen. Put 
it into a small pan, and mix it lightly into a lithe paste, with half an 
ounce of yeast, and a spoonful or two of warm water ; make two or 
three slignt incisions across the top, throw a doth oyer the pan, and 
place it near the fire for about twenty minutes to rise. In the in- 
teryal make a hollow space in the centre of the remainder of the

flonr, and pnt into it half an ounce of salt, as mnen fine sifted sngar, 
and half a gill of cream, or a dessertspoonful of water ; add a pound 
of butter as free from moisture as it can be, and ouite so from large 
grains of salt ; cut it into small bits, put it into tiie flour, and pour 
on it one by one six fresh eggs freed from the specks ; then with 
the fingers work the flour genUy into this mass until the whole fiiima 
a perfectly smooth, and not stiff paste : a scTenth eg^ or the yolk of 
one, or even of two, may be added with advantage jf the flour will 
absorb them; but the brioche must always be tcarkabUy and not so 
moist as to adhere to the board and roller disagreeably. When the 
leaven is well risen spread this paste out, and the leaven over it; 
mix them well together with the hands, then cut the whole into 
several portions, and change them about that the leaven may be in- 
corporated perfectly and equally with the other ingredients : when 
this is done, and the briocne is perfectly smooth imd pliable, dust 
•ome flour on a doth, roll the brioche in it, and lay it into a pan. 
Place it in summer in a eool place, in winter in a warm one. It is 
usually made over-niffht, and baked in the early part of the follow- 
log day. It should then be kneaded up afiesh the firrt thins in the 
morning. To mould it in the usual £>rm, make it into baUa dt 
uniform sixe, hollow these a Utile at the top by pressing Uie thnn^ 
round them, brush them over with yolk of egg, and nut a second 
much smaller ball into the hollow part of each ; glaae tnem entirely 
with yolk of egg, and send them to a ^uick oven for half an hour or 
more. The paste may also be made into the form of a large cake, 
then placed on a tin, or copper oven-leaf, and supported with a 
pasteboard in the b aking ; for the form of which see introdnctoiT

a little rough on the surface. Bake the pa«ty in a moderate oven

its axe and its contents. Fin a folded napkin neatly round the 
mould, before it is served, and have ready a hot dish to receive the 
cover, which must not be lified off until after the pasty is on the 
table. 

Chicken, or veal and oysters ; delicate pork chops with a seasoning 
of sage and a little parboiled onion, or an eschalot or two finely 
mino^; partridges or rabbits neatly carved, mixed with small 
mushrooms, and moistened with a little good stock, will all give 
excellent varieties of this dish, which may be made likewise with 
highly seasoned slices of ealmoa freed from the skin, tpiinklol with 
fiitt herbs or intermixed with shrimps; clarified butter, rich v^ 
stock, or good white wine, may be poured to them to form the eravy.

emptied, with a rich mince or fricassee, or with stewed oysters in a 
hichamel sance. French cooks make a very troublesome and elabo- 
rate affair of this dish, putting to the rice to make it " meUow^ a 
great deal of pot-top fat, slices of fat ham, &c., which must after- 
wards be well drained off, or picked out j&om it ; but the dish, made 
as we have directed, will be found excellent eating, and of veiy 
elegant appearance, if it be moulded in a tasteful snape. It must 
have a quick oven to colour, without too much drying it The rice for 
it must be boiled sufficiently tender to be crushed ^sily to a smooth 
paste, and it must be mashd with a strong wooden spoon against the 
sides of the stewpan until all the ^ains are broken. It may tiien, 
when cool, be made like a raised pie with the hands, and decorated 
with a design formed on it with a carrot cut into a point like a 
grayer. For a large casserole, a pound of rice and a quart of gniyy 
will be required : a bit of bread is sometimes used in filling the 
mould, cut to the shape, and occupying nearly half the inside, but 
always so as to leave a thick and compact crust in eveiy part. Part 
of the rice which is scooped from tne inside is sometunes mi^d 
with the mince, or other preparation, with which the casserole is 
filled 

A QOOD COMUON ENGLISH GAME PIE. 

liaise the flesh entire from the upper side of the best end of s 
well-kept neck of venison, trim it to the length of the dish in which 
the pie is to be served, and rub it with a mixture of salt, cayenne, 
pounded mace, and nutmeg. Cut down into joints a fine youn£^ hare 
which has hung from eiffht to fourteen days, bone t he ba< £ and 
thighs, and fill them wi& forcemeat No. 1 (Chapter YUL, page 
157), bnt put into it a double portion of butter, and a small quantity 
of minced eschalots, should their fiavour be liked, and the raw liver 
of the hare, chopped small. Line the dish witii a rich short crust 
(see page 337), lay the venison in the centre, and the hare closely 
round and on it ; fill the vacant spaces with more forcemeat, add a 
few spoonsful of well-jellied graw, fasten on the cover securdy, 
ornament it or not, at pleasure, ana bake the pie for two hours in a 
well heated oven. The remnants and bones of the hare and venison 
may be stewed down into a small quantity of excellent soup, or with 
a less proportion of water into an admirable gravy, part of which, 
after having been cleared from fat, may be poured into the pie. The 
jelly, added to its contents at first, can be made, when no sadb stock 
IS at hand, of a couple of pounds of shin of beef^ boiled down in a 
quart of water, which must be reduced quite half^ and seasoned only 
with a good slice of lean ham, a few pepnercoms, seven or dffht 
doves, a blade of mace, and a little salt One pound and a half of 
flour will be suffident for the crust ; this, when it is so prdbned, 
may be laid round the sides only of the didi, instead of entirdr over 
it Xhe prime joints of a second hare may be sabstitated nxr tlie

▼enison when it can be more easily procured; bnt the pie made 
entirely of venison, without the forcemeat, will be far better. 

Baked 2 hours. 

Obs, — These same ingredients will make an excellent raised pie, if 
the yenison be divided and intermixed with the hare: the whole 
should be highly seasoned, and all the cavities filled with the force- 
meat No. 18 (Chapter YIU.),* or with the truffled sausage-meat of 
page 263. The top, before the paste is laid4>ver, should be covered 
iirith slioes of fat bacon, or with plenty of butter, to prevent the 
sarfaoe of the meat from becoming hard. No liquid is to be put 
into the pie until after it is baked, if at all. It will require from half 
to a fuU nour more of the oven than if baked in a dish. 



MODERN CHICKEN PIE. 

Skin, and cut down into joints a couple of fowls, take out all the 
bones, and season the flesh highly with salt, cayenne, pounded mace, 
and nutmeg; line a dish with a thin paste, and spread over it a 
la^er of the finest sausage-meat, which has previously been moistened 
with a spoonful or two of cold water ; over this place closely together 
some of the boned chicken joints, then more sausage-meat, and con- 
tinue thus vnth alternate layers of each, until the dish is full ; roll 
out, and fasten securely at the edges, a cover half an inch thick, trim 
off the superfluous paste, make an incision in the top, lay some paste 
leaves round it, glaze the whole with yolk of egg, and bake the pie 
from an hour and a half to two hours in a well heated oven. Lay 
a sheet or two of writing-paper over the crust, should it brown too 
quickly. Minced herbs can be mixed with the sausage-meat at 
pleasure, and a small quantity of eschalot also, when its flavour is 
much liked : it should be weU moistened with water, or the whole 
will be unpalatably dr^. The pie may be served hot or cold, but we 
would rather recommend the latter. 

A couple of very young tender rabbits will answer exceedingly 
-well for it instead of fowl^ and a border, or half paste in the dish 
will generally be preferred to an entire lining of the crust, which is 
now but rarely served, unless for pastry, which is to be taken out of 
the diah or mould in which it is baked before it is sent to table. 

A COMMON OHICKSN PIE. 

Prepare the fowls as for bdling, ent them down into joints, and 
season them with salt, white pepper, and nutm^ or pounded maoe; 
arrange them neatly in a dish boraered vdth paste, lay amongst them 
three or four fresh eggs boiled hard, and cut in halves, pour in some 
•old water, put on a thi<^ cover, pare the edge, and ornament it,

make a hole in the centre, lay a roll of paste, or a few leaves ronnd 
it, and bake the pie in a moderate oven from an honr to an hoar and 
a half. The back and neck bones may be boiled down with a bit or 
two of lean ham, to make a little additional gravy, which can be 
poured into the pie after it is baked. 

FIOBON PIE. 

Lay a border of fine pnff paste round a large dish, and cover the 
bottom with a veal cutlet or tender rump steak, free from fat and 
bone, and seasoned with salt, cayenne, and nutmeg or pounded mace; 
prepare with great nicety as many freshly-killed young pigeons as 
the dish will contain in one layer ; put into each a slice or ball of 
butter, seasoned with a little cayenne and mace, lay them into the 
dish with the breasts downwards, and between and over them put the 
volks of half a dozen or more of hard-boiled eggs ; stick plenty of 
butter on them, season the whole well with salt and spice, pour in 
some cold water or veal broth for the gravy, roll out the cover three- 
quarters of an inch thick, secure it well round the edse, ornament it 
highly, and bake the pie for an hour or more in a w^-heated oven. 
It is a great improvement to fill the birds with small mushroom- 
buttons, preparea as for partridges (see Chapter XY.) : their livers 
also may be put into them. 

BEEF-STEAK PIE. 

From a couple to three pounds of rump-steak will be sufficient for 
a good family pie. It should be well kept though perfectly sweet* 
for in no form can tainted meat be more offensive tnan when it is 
enclosed in paste. Trim off the coarse skin, and part of the fat 
should there be much of it (many eaters dislike it altogether in {nes* 
and when this is the case every morsel should be carefully cut 
away). If the beef should not appear very tender, it may be gently 
beaten with a paste-roller until the fibre is broken, then dividra into 
slices half as large as the hand, and laid into a dish bordered with 
paste. It should be seasoned with salt and pepper, or cayenne, and 
sufficient water poured in to make the gravy, and keep the meat 
moist. Lay on tne cover, and be careful always to brush the edge in 
every part with egg or cold water, then join it securely to the paste 
which IS round the rim, trim both off close to the dish, pass the point 
of the knife through the middle of the cover, lay some slight roll or 
ornament of paste round it, and decorate the border of the pie in any 
of the usual modes, which are too common to require descriptioiu 
Send the pie to a well-heated, but not fierce oven for about an hour 
and twenty minutes. To make a richer beef-steak pie put bearded 
oysters in alternate layers with the meat, add their strained liquor to 
a little (rood gravy in which the beards may be simmered for a few 
minutes to give it further flavour, and make a light puff paste for 



CHAP, xym.] PASTBT. 355 

the crust. Some eaters like it seasoned with a small portion of 
minced onion or eschalot when the oysters are omitted. Mushrooms 
improve all meat-pies. Veal pies may be made by this receipt, or by 
the second of those which follow. Slices of lean ham, or parboiled 
ox-tongue, may be added to them. 
1 to 14 hour. 



COMMON MUTTON PIE. 

A pound and a quarter of flour will make sufficient paste for 
a moderate-sized pie, and two pounds of mutton freed from the 
greater portion of the fat will fill it Butter a dish and line it with 
about half the jMiste rolled thin ; lay in the mutton evenly, and 
sprinkle over it three-quarters of an ounce of salt, and from naif to 
a whole teaspoonful of pepper according to the taste ; pour in cold 
-water to within an inch of the brim. Roll the cover, miick should 
be quite half an inch thick, to the size of the dish; wet the edges of 
the paste with cold water or white of egg, be careful to dose them 
securely, cut them off close to the rim ofthe dish, stick the point of 
the knife through the centre, and bake the pie an hour and a quarter 
in a well-heated oven. 

Plour, H lb. ; minced suet rather less than i| lb. ; or, butter, 4 oz., 
and very pure lard, 2 or 3 oz. ; mutton, 2 lbs. ; salt, } oz. ; pepper, 
half to a whole teaspoonful ; water, i pint : li hour. 



A GOOD MUTTON PIB. 

Lay a half-paste of short or of puff crust round a buttered dish ; 
take the whole or part of a loin of mutton, strip off the fat entirely, 
and raise the flesh clear from the bones without dividing it, then slice 
it into cutlets of equal thickness, season them well with salt and 
nepper, or cayenne, and strew between the layers some finely-minced 
nerbs mixed with two or three eschalots, when the flavour of these 
last is liked; or omit them, and roil quite thin some good forcemeat 
(which can be flavoured with a little minced eschalot at pleasure), 
and lay it between the cutlets: two or three mutton kidneys inter- 
mingled with the meat will greatly enrich the gravy ; pour in a 
little cold water, roll the cover half an inch thick, or more should 
the crust be short, as it will not lise like puff paste, close the pie 
very securely, trim the edges even with the dish, ornament the pie 
wording to the taste, make a hole in the centre, and bake it from 
in hour and a half to a couple of hours. The proportions of paste 
and meat may be ascertained by consulting the last receipt. Gravy 
made with part of the bones, quite cleared from fat, and left to 
become cold, may be used to fill the pie instead of water.

and this is eaten usually with the meat which it contains, la either 
case the paste must be sufficiently stiff to retain its form perfectly 
after it is raised, as it will have no support to ;)reYent its falling. 
The celebrated Monsieur Ude gives the following directions for 
moulding it to a proper shape without difficulty; and as inex- 
perienced cooks generally find a little at first in giving a jrood 
appearance to these pies, we copy his instructions for them : "• Take 
a lump of paste proportionate to the size of the pie you are to make, 
mould it in the shape of a sugar loaf^ put it upright on the table, 
then with the pidms of your hands flatten the sides of it; when you 
have equalized it all round and it is quite smooth, squeeze the 
middle of the point down to half the height of the paste,** then 
hollow the inside by pressing it with the fingers, and in doing this 
be careful to keep it m every part of equal Uiickness. Fill it,t roll 
out the cover, ^g the edges, press them securely t<^ether, niake a 
hole in the centre, lay a roll or paste round it, and encircle this with 
a wreath of leaves, or ornament the pie in any other way, according 
to the taste ; glaze it with beaten yolk of egg, and bake it from 
two to three hours in a well-heated oven if itbe small, and from 
four to five hours if it be large ; though the time must be related 
in some measure by the nature of the contents, as well as by Uie size 
of the dish. 

Obs,—We know not if we have succeeded in making the leader 

* We remember having partaken of one which was brought firom Bordeaux, 
and which contained a small boned ham of delicious flaToor, sormotinted by 
boned partridges, above which were placed fine larks likewise boned ; iJl the 
interstices were filled with saper-exoellent forcemeat, and the whole, being a 
solid mass of nourishing Tiands, would have formed an admirable tniTeller's 
larder in itself. 

f For the mode of doing this, see obserrations, page 258, and Chapter XXXIY* 
A ham must be boiled or stewed tender, and freed from tlie skin and blackened

comprehend that this sort of pe (with the exception of the cover, for 
whidi a portion mast at first he taken off) is made from one solid 
lump of paste, which, afler having heen shaped into a cone, as 
Monsieur iJde directs, or into a hiffh round, or oval form, is hollowed 
hy pressing down the centre with the knuckles, and continuing to 
knead the inside equally round with the one hand, while the ouier 
is pressed close to the outside. It is desirable that the mode of 
doing this should be once seen by the learner, if possible, as mere 
verbal instructions are scarcely sufficient to enable the quite-inex- 
perienced cook to comprehend at once the exact form and appear- 
ance which should be given to the paste, and some degree of ex- 
Ciess is always necessary to mould a pie of this kind well with the 
rs only. The first attempts should be made with very small 
pies, which are less difficult to manage. 

A VOL-AU-VENT. (eMTr££.) 

This dish can be suc- 
cessfully made only with the 
finest and lightest puff-paste 
(see feuiUetagey page 345), 
as its height, which ought 
to be from four to five 
inches, depends entirely on 
its rising m the oven. KoU 

it to something more than an ^ — ^^^^_^^ 

inch in thickness, and cut it 

to the shape and size of the inside of the dish in which it is to be 
served, or stamp it out with a fluted tin of proper dimensions ; then 
mark the cover evenly about an inch from the edge all round, and 
ornament it and the border also, with a knife, as tancy may direct ; 
brush yolk of egg quickly over them, and put the vol-au-vent 
immediately into a brisk oven, that it may rise well, and be finely 
coloured, but do not allow it to be scorched. In from twenty to 
thirty minutes, should it appear baked through, as well as sufficiently 
browned, draw it out, and with the point of a knife detach the 
cover carefully where it has been marked, and scoop out all the 
soft unbaked crumb from the inside of the vol-au-vent; then turn 
it gently on to a sheet of clean paper, to drain the butter from it. 
At the instant of serving, fill it with a rich fricassee of lobster, or of 
sweetbreads, or with turhot a la creme^ or with the white part of 
cold roast veal cut in thin collops not larger than a shilling, and 
heated in good white sauce with ovsters (see minced veal and oysters, 
page 251), or with any other of the preparations which we shall 
inmcate in their proper places, and send it immediately to table. 
Tlie vol-au'vent, as the reader will perceive, is but the case, oi 
cnst, in which various kinds of delicate ragouts are served in an 
elegant form. As these are most frequently composed of fish, or of 




358 MODERK COOKEBT. [chap. rvni. 

meats which have heen already dressed, it is an economical as well as 
an excellent mode of employing such remains. The sauces in which 
they are heated must be quite thick, for they would otherwise 
soften, or even run through the crust. This, we ought to obsenre, 
should be examined before it is filled, and should any part appear too 
thin, a portion of the crumb which has been taken out, should be 
fastenea to it with some beaten egg, and the whole of the inside 
brushed lightly with more egg, in order to make the loose parts 
of the vol-au'vent stick well together. This method is recommended 
by an admirable and highly experienced cook, but it need only be 
resorted to when the crust is not solid enough to hold the contents 
securely. 

For moderate-sized vol-au-ventj flour, J lb. ; butter, ^ lb. ; salt, 
small saltspoonful ; yolk, 1 egg; little water. Larger voUau-vent, 
i lb. flour; other ingredients in proportion: baked 20 to SO 
minutes. 

Oba. — ^When the voUau-vewt is cut out with the fluted cutter, a 
second, some sizes smaller, after being just dipped into hot water, 
should be pressed nearly half through the paste, to mark the coyer. 
The border ought to be from three-quarters of an inch to an inch 
and a half wide. 



A VOL-AU-VEKT OP FRUIT. (eNTREMETS.) 

After the crust has been uLHde and baked as above, fill it at the 
moment of serving with peaches, apricots, mogul, or any other 
richly flavoured plums, which have been stewed tender in svrup ; lijEt 
them from this, and keep them hot while it is boiled rapiclly almost 
to jelly; then arrange the ft'uit in the voUau-venLi and pour Uie 
syrup over it. For the manner of preparing it, see compotes of 
fruit, Chapter XXIY. ; but increase the proportion of sugar nearly 
half, that the juice may be reduced quickly to the proper consistency 
for the vol-au'vent. Skin and divide the apricots, and quarter the 
peaches, unless they should be very small. 



VOL-AU-YENT A LA CRiME. (eNTREMETS.) 

After having raised the cover and emptied the tfol-au-vent^ lay it 
on a sheet of paper, and let it become cold. Fill it just before it is 
sent to table with fruit, either boiled down to a rich marmalade, or 
stewed as for the preceding vol-aU'Vent, and heap well flavoured, 
but not too highly sweetened, whipped cream over it. The edge of 
the crust may be blazed by sifting sugar over it, when it is drawn 
from the oven, and holding a salamander or red hot shovel above it ; 
or it may be left unglazed, and ornamented with bright coloured 
fruit jelly.

OYSTER PATTIES.* (ENTRis). 

Line some small patty-pazis with fine puff-paste, rolled thin and to 
preserve their form when baked, put a bit of bread into each; lay on 
the covers, pinch and trim the edges, and send the patties to a brisk 
oven. Plump and beard from two to three dozens of small ovsters ; 
mix very smoothly a teaspoonful of flour with an ounce of butter, 
put them into a clean saucepan, shake them round over a gentle fire, 
and let them simmer for two or three minutes ; throw in a little salt, 
pounded mace, and cayenne, then add, by slow degrees, two or three 
spoonsful of rich cream, give these a boil, and pour in the strained 
liquor of the oysters ; next, lay in the fish, and keep at the point of 
boiling for a couple of minutes. Raise the covers from the patties, 
take out the bread, fill them with the oysters and their sauce, and re- 
place the covers. We have found it an improvement to stew the 
beards of the fish with a strip or two of lemon-peel, in a little good 
▼eal stock for a quarter of an hour, then to strain and add it to the 
Bauce. The oysters, unless very small, should be once or twice 
divided. 

COMMON LOBSTER PATTIES. 

Prepare the fish for these as directed for fricasseed lobster. Chapter 
II., increasing a little the proportion of sauce. Fill the patty-cases 
with the mixture quite hot, and serve immediately. 

SUPERLATIVE LOBSTER-PATTIES. 

(Authar^s Receipt.) 

Form into balls about half the size of a 

filbert either the cutlet-mixture or the 

pounded lobster of Chapter 111., roll them 

m the sifted coral, warm them through very 

ly, have ready some hot patty-cases 

(see page 361 ), pour into each a small spoonful of rich white sauce, 

or Sauce a VAurore (see page 118), lay the balls round the edge, 

pile a larger one in the centre, and serve the whole very quickly. 

The Dresden patties of page 387 may be thus filled.

GOOD CHICKEN PATTIES. (ENTIliB ) 

Raise the white flesh entirely from a young undressed fowl, divide 
it once or twice, and lay it into a small clean saucepan, in which 

* These pattins should be made small, with a thin crust, and wtU /UM with 
the oysters aud iheir sauce. The subBtitution of fried crumbs for the covers will 
wary them very agreeably. For lobster patties, prepare the fish as for a ve^^if 
•Mni, but cut it smaller.

about an ounce of butter has been dissolved, and just b^na to 
simmer ; strew in a slight seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne, and 
stew the chicken very softly indeed for about ten minutes, taiking 
every precaution against its browning : turn it into a dish with the 
butter, and its own gravy, and let it become cold. Mince it with a 
sharp knife; heat it. without allowing it to boil, in a little good 
white sauce (which may be made of some of the bones of the fowl), 
and fill ready-baked patty-crusts, or small vol-aU'VenU with it, just 
before the^ are sent to table ; or stew the flesh only just sufficiently 
to render it firm, mix it after it is minced and seasoned with a spoon- 
ful or two of strong gravy, fill the patties, and bake them from 
fifteen to eighteen minutes. It is a great improvement to stew and 
mince a few mushrooms with the chicken. 

The breasts of cold turkey, fowls, partridges, or pheasants, or the 
white part of cold veal, minced, heated in a bichamel sauce, will 
serve at once for patties: they may also be made of cold game, 
heated in an Espagnole^ or in a good brown gravy. 

PATTIES A LA PONTIFE. (ENTR£i!:.J 

{A fast day^ or Maigrt disk.) 

Mince, but not very small, the yolks of six fresh hard-boiled eggs; 
mince also and mix with them A couple of fine truffles,* a large salt- 
spoonful of salt, half the quantity of mace and nutmeg, and a fourth 
as much of cayenne. Moisten these ingredients with a spoonful of 
thick cream, or bechamel maigre (see page 109), or with a dessert- 
spoonful of clarified butter ; line the patty-moulds, fill them with 
the mixture, cover, and bake them from twelve to fifteen minutes in 
a moderate oven. They are excellent made with the cream-cmst of 
page 347. 

Yolks hard-boiled eggs, 6 ; truffles, 2 large ; seasoning of salt, 
mace, nutmeg, and cayenne; cream, or bechaniel maigre, 1 table- 
spoonful, or clarified butter, 1 dessertspoonful : baked moderate 
oven, 12 to 15 minutes. 

Obs. — A spoonful or two of jellied stock or gravy, or of good 
white sauce, converts these into admirable patties : the same ingre* 
dients make also very superior rolls or cannelons. For Patties 1 la 
Cardinale, small mushroom-buttons stewed as for partridges, ChaptbT 
XIII., before they are minced, must be substituted for truffles ; and 
the butter in which they are simmered should be added with them 
to the eggs.

and form it into small rolls, not larger than a finger; wrap twice or 
thrice as much of the pounded meat equally round each of these, first 
moistenuiff it with a teaspoonful of water ; fold them in good pufi"- 
paste, and bake them from fifteen to twenty minutes, or until the 
crust is perfectly done. A small quantity of the lean of a boiled ham 
may be finely minced and pounded with the veal, and very small 
mushrooms, prepared as for a partridge (page 329), may be sub- 
etituted for the forcemeat. 

SMALL VOLS-AU-TENTS, OR PATTT-CABES. 



mm mm 



These are quickly and easily made with two round paste-cutters, 
of which one should be little more than half the size of the other : 
to give the pastry a better appearance, they should be fluted. Roll 
out some of the lightest pun-paste to a half-inch of thickness, and 
with the larger of the tins cut the number of patties required ; then 
dip the edge of the small shape into hot water, and press it about 
half through them. Bake them in a moderately quick oven from 
ten to twelve minutes, and when they are done, with the point of a 
sharp knife, take out the small rounds of crust from the tops, and 
scoop all the crumb from the inside of the patties, which may then be 
filled with shrimps, oysters, lobster, chicken, pheasant, or any other 
of the ordinary varieties of patty meat, prepared with white sauce. 
Pried crumbs may be laid over them instead of the covers, or these 
last can be replaced. 

For sweet dishes, glaze the pastry, and fill it with rich whipped 
cream, preserve, or boiled custard ; if with the last of these put it 
back into a very gentle oven until the custards are set. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR TARTLETS. 

For a dozen tartlets, cut twenty-four rounds of paste of the usual 
si^e, and form twelve of them into rings by pressing the small cutter 
quite through them ; moisten these with cold water, or white of egg, 
aod lay them on the remainder of the rounds of paste, so as to form 
tlie rims of the tartlets. Bake them from ten to twelve minutes, fill 
ftbem with preserve while they are still warm, and place over it a 



362 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. ZTIH. 

small ornament of paste cut from the remnants, and baked gently of 
a light colour. Serve the tartlets cold, or if wanted hot tor table 
put them back into the oven for one minute after they are filled. 

A SEFTON^ OR TEAL CUSTARD. 

Pour boiling, a pint of rich, dear, pale veal gravy on six fiiesli 
Cttgs, which have been well beaten and strained : sprinkle in directly 
the grated rind of a fine lemon, a little cayenne, some salt if needed^ 
and a quarter- teaspoonful of mace. Put a paste border round a dish, 
pour in, first two ounces of clarified butter, and then the other ingre- 
dients; bake the Seflon in a very slow oven from twenty-five to 
thirty minutes, or until it is quite firm in the middle, and send it to 
table with a little good gravy. Very highly flavoured game stock, 
in which a few mushrooms have been stewed, may be u^ for this 
dish with great advantage in lieu of veal gravy ; and a sauce made of 
the smallest mushroom buttons, mav be served with it in either case^ 
The mixture can be baked in a whole paste, if preferred so, or in well 
buttered cups ; then turned out and covered with the sauce before it 
is sent to table. 

Rich veal or game stock, 1 pint ; fresh eggs, 6 ; rind, 1 lemon ; 
little salt and cayenne ; pounded mace, ^ teaspoonful ; butter, 2 oz. : 
baked, 25 to 30 minutes, slow oven. 



Work together with the fingers, ten ounces of butter and a pound 
of flour, until they resemble fine crumbs of bread ; throw in a small 
pinch of salt, and make them into a firm smooth paste with the yolks 
of two eggs and a spoonful or two of water. Butter thickly, a plain 
tin cake, or pie mould (those which open at the sides, see plate, page 
344, are best adapted for the purpose; ; roll out the paste thin, place 
the mould upon it, trim a bit to its exact size, cover the bottom of the 
mould with this, then cut a band the height of the sides, and press 
it smoothly round them, joining the edge, which must be moistened 
with egg or water, to the bottom crust ; and fasten upon them, to 
prevent their separation, a narrow and thin band of paste, also 
moistened. Next, fill the mould nearly from the brim with the fol- 
lowing marmalade, which must be quite cold when it is put in. 
Boil together, over a gentle fire at first, but more quickly afterwards, 
three pounds of eood apples with fourteen ounces of pounded sugar, 
or of the finest Lisbon, the strained juice of a large lemon, throe 
ounces of fresh butter, and a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, or 
the lightly grated rind of a couple of lemons : when the whole is 
perfectly smooth and dry, turn it into a pan to cool, and let it be 
quite cold before it is put into the paste. In early autumn, a larger 
proportion of sugar may be reouired, but this can be regulated by the 
taste When the mould is filled, roll out the cover, lay it cardfully

oyer the marmalade that it may not touch it ; and when the cake is 
secnrely closed, trim olf the superfluous paste, add a little pounded 
sugar to the parings, spread them out very thin, and cut them into 
leaves to ornament the top of the cake, round which they may he 
placed as a sort of wreath.* Bake it for an hour in a moderately 
brisk oven ; take it from the mould, and should the sides not be 
Buffidently coloured put it back for a few minutes into the oven upon 
a baking tin. Lay a paj^r over the top, when it is of a fine light 
brown, to prevent its bemg too deeply coloured. This cake should 
be served hot. 

Paste : flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 10 oz. ; yolks of eg|p;s, 2 ; little water. 
Marmalade: apples, 3 lbs.; sugar, 14 oz. (more if needed); juice of 
lemon, 1 ; rinds of lemons, 2 ; butter, 3 oz. : baked, 1 hour 

TOURTE HERINGViE^ OR TART WITH ROYAL ICING.t 

Lay a band of fine paste round the rim of a tart-dish, fill it with 
any kind of fruit mixed with a moderate proportion of sugar, roll 
oat the cover very evenly, moisten the edges of the paste, press them 
together carefully, and trim them off close to tne dish ; spread 
equally over the top, to within rather more than an inch of the edge 
all round, the whites of three fresh eggs beaten to a quite solid froth 
and mixed quickly at the moment of using them with three table- 
spoonsful of dry sifted snear. Put the tart into a moderately brisk 
oven« and when the crust nas risen well and the icing is set, either 
lay a sheet of writing-paper lightly over it, or draw it to a part of 
the oven where it will not take too much colour. This is now a 
fashionable mode of icing tarts, and greatly improves their appear- 
ance. 

Bake half an hour. 

A GOOD APPLE TART. 

A pound and a quarter of apples weighed after they are pared and 
cored, will be sufficient for a small tart, and four ounces more for 
one of moderate size. Lay a border of English puff-paste, or of 
cream-crust round the dish, just dip the apples into water, arrange 
them very compactly in it, higher in the centre than at the sides, 
and strew amonest them from three to four ounces of pounded 
sugar, or more would they be very acid : the grated rind and the 
Btrained juice of half a lemon will much improve their flavour. Lay

on the coyer rolled thin, and ice it or not at pleasure. Send the tart 
to a moderate oven for about half an hour. This may be converted 
into the old-fashioned creamed apple tart, by cutting out the cover 
'While it is still quite hot, leavinf^ only about an inch- wide border cf 
paste round the edge, and pourmg over the apples when they have 
become cold, from half to three-quarters of a pint of rich boGed 
custard. The cover divided into triangular sippets, was formerly 
stuck round the inside of the tart, but ornamental leaves of pale 
puff- paste have a better effect. Well-drained whipped cream may 
oe substituted for the custard, and be piled high, and lightly over 
thefhiit. 

TART OF TBRT YOUNG OREBN APPLES. (gOOD.) 

Take very young apples from the tree before the cores are formed, 
clear off the buds and stalks, wash them well, and fill a tart-dish 
with them after having rolled them in plenty of sugpar, or strew 
layers of sugar between them ; add a very smiJl quantity of water, 
and bake the tart rather slowly, that the fruit may be tender quite 
throuffh. It will resemble a green apricot-tart if carefully made. 
We give this receipt from recollection, having had the dish served 
often formerly, and having found it nery good. 

BARBERRY TART. 

Barberries, with half their weight of fine brown sugar, when they 
are thoroughly ripe, and with two ounces more when they are not 
quite so, make an admirable tart. For one of moderate siie, put into 
a dish bordered with paste three quarters of a pound of bfurbenies 
stripped from their stalks, and six ounces of sugar in alternate 
layers; pour over them three tablespoonsful of water, put on the 
cover, and bake the tart for half an hour. Another way of making 
it is, to line a shallow tin pan with very thin crust, to mix the fimit 
and sugar well together with a spoon before they are laid in, and to 
put bars of paste across instead of a cover; or it may be baked 
without either.*

finest flour, and break lightly into it four ounces of fresh butter, 
vhich should be firm. lk£ike these up smoothly with cold milk or 
-water, of which nearly a quarter of a pint will be sufficient, unless 
the butter should be very hard, when a spoonful or two more must 
be added. Koil the paste out as lightly as possible twice or thrice 



if needful, to blend the butter thoroughly with it, and each time 
either fold it in three by wrapping the ends over each other, or fold 
it oyer and oyer like a roll pudding. An additional ounce, or even 
two, of butter can be used for it when yery rich pastry is Uked, but 
the tourte will not then retain its form so well. Boll it out evenly to 
Bomething more than three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and 
press the large cutter firmly tnrough it ; draw away the superfluous 
paste, and lay the tottrte on a liehSy floured baking-tin. Koll the 
remainder or the paste until it is less than a Quarter of an inch thick, 
and stamp out with the smaller cutter— of which the edge should be 
dipped into hot water, or slightly encrusted with flour— as many 
rounds as will form the border of the tourte. In placing them upon 
it, lay the edge of one over the other just sufficiently to give a shell- 
like appearance to the whole ; and with the finger press lightly on 
the opposite part of the round to make it adhere to the under paste. 
Kezt, with a sharp -pointed knife, make an incision very evenly 
loiind the inside of the tourte nearly close to the border, but be 
extremely careful not to cut too deeply into the paste. Bake it in a 
gentle oven, from twenty to thir^ minutes. When it is done, 
detach the crust from the centre, where it has been marked with 
the knife,, take out part of the crumb, fill the space high with 
apricot-jam, or with any other choice preserve, set it again for an 
instant into the oven, and serve it hot or cold. Spikes of blanched 
almonds, filberts, or pistachio-nuts, may be strewed over the pre- 
serre, when they are considered an improvement ; and the border of 
the pastry may be glazed or ornamented to the fancy ; but if well 
made, it wUl generallpr please in its quite simple form. It may be 
oonverted into a delicious entree^ by filling it either with oysters, 
or sliced sweetbreads, stewed, and served in thick, rich, white 
aaoce, or hSchameL Lobster also prepared and moulded as for the

the other half upon it, the brown side outwards, and leave the paste

be found delicious the day it is baked, but its excellence is destroyed 
by keeping Peach, green-gage, or magnum bonum jam, will serve 
for it quite as well as apricot. We strongly recommend to our 
readers this preparation, baked in patty-pans, and servoi hot ; or the 
whole quantity made into a pudding. From the smaller ones a 
little may be taken out with a teaspoon, and replaced with some 
preserve just before they are sent to table; or they may thus be 
eaten cold.

ALMOND PASTE. 

Por a mngle dish of pastrj, blanch seven ounces of fine Jordan 
almonds and one of bitter ; * throw them into cold water as they are 
done, and let them remain in it for an hour or two ; then wipe, and 
pound them to the finest paste, moistening them occasionally with a 
few drops of cold water, to prevent their oiling ; next, add to, and 
mix thoroughly with them, seven ounces of highly-refined, dried, 
and sifted sugar ; put them into a small preserving-pan, or enamelled 
stewpan, and stir tnem over a clear and very gentle fire until they 
are so dry as not to adhere to the finger when touched ; turn the 
paste immediately into an earthen pan or jar, and when cold it will 
be ready for use. 

Jordan almonds, 7 oz. ; bitter almonds, 1 oz. ; cold water, 1 table- 
spoonful ; sugar, 7 oz. 

Ohs, — The pan in which the paste is dried, should by no means be 
placed upon the fire, but high above it on a bar or trevet : should it 
be allowed by accident to harden too much, it must be sprinkled 
plentifully with water, broken up quite small, and worked, as it 
warms, with a strong wooden spoon to a smooth paste a^ain. We 
have found this method perfectly successful ; but, if time will permit, 
it should be moistened some hours before it is again set over the 
file 

TARTLETS OF ALMOND PASTE. 

Bntter slightly the smallest-sized patty-pans, and line them with 
the almond-paste rolled as thin as possible ; cut it with a sharp knife 
close to their edges, and bake or rather dry the tartlets slowly at the 
mouth of a very cool oven. K at all coloured, they should be only 
of Uie palest brown ; but they will become perfectly crisp without 
lo«ng their whiteness if left for some hours m a very gently- heated 
stove or oven. They should be taken from the pans when two- thirds 
done, and laid, reversed, upon a sheet of paper placed on a dish or 
boud, before they are put back into the oven. At the instant of 
. serving, fill them with bright-coloured whipped cream, or with peach 
or apricot jam ; if the preserve be used, lay over it a small star or 
other ornament cut from the same paste, and dried with the tartlets. 
SiHed sugar, instead of flour, must be dredged upon the board and 
roller in usins almond paste. Leaves and flowers formed of it, and 
di led graduaSy until perfectly crisp, will keep for a long time in a

tin box or canister, and they form elegant decorations for pastry. 
When a fluted cutter the size of the pattypans is at hand, it will be 
an improyement to cut out the paste witn it, and then to press it 
lightly into them, as it is rather apt to break when pared off with a 
knife. To colour it, prepared cochineal, or spinacn-green, must be 
added to it in the mortar. 

FAIRY FANCIES. 

(Faniames de F^s.") 

A small, but very inexpenaye set 
of tin cutters must be had for this 
pretty form of pastry, which is, how- 
_ eyer, quite worthy of so s%ht a cost 
^r* The short crust, of pase 349, answers 
for it better than puff paste. Roll 
it thin and yery eyen, and with the 
larger tin, shaped thus, cut out a dozen or more of small sheets; 
then, with a couple of round cutters, of which one should be about 
an inch in diameter, and the other 
only half the size, form four times 
the number of rings, and lay them 
on the sheets in the manner shown 
in the engraying. The easier mode 
of placing them regularly, is to raise 
eacn ring without remoymff the small cutter from it, to moisten it 
with a cameVs hair brush dipped in white of eeg, and to lay it on the 
paste as it is gently loosened from the tin. When all the pastry is 
prepared, set it into a yery gentle oyen, that it may become crisp and 
yet remain quite pale. Before it is sent to table, fill the four divi- 
sions of each /antoim with preserve of a different colour. For ex- 
ample : one ring with apple or strawberry jelly, another with apricot 
jam, a third with peach or green-gage, and a fourth with raspberry 
lelly. The cases may be iced, and ornamented in yarious ways 
before they are baked. They are prettiest when formed of white 
almond-paste, with pink or pale mreen rinffs : they may then be filled, 
at the instant of serying, with wdl-drained whipped cream.

grated rinds of two large lemons, and two more boiled quite tender, 
and chopped np entirely, with the exception of the pips, two small 
nutmegs, half an ounce of salt, a large teaspoonful of pounded mace, 
rather more of ginger in powder, half a pint of brandy, and as much 
good sherry or Madeira. Mince these ingredients separately, and 
mix the others all well before the brandy and the wine are added ; 
press the whole into a Jar or jars, and keep it closely covered. It 
should be stored for a tew days before it is used, and will remain 
good for many weeks. Some persons like a slight flavouring of 
cloves in addition to the other spices ; others add the juice of two or 
three lemons, and a larger quantity of brandy. The inside of a 
tender and well-roasted sirloin of beef will answer quite as well as 
the tongue. 

Of a fresh-boiled ox-tongue, or inside of roasted sirloin, 1 lb. ; 
stoned raisins and minced apples, each 2 lbs. ; currants and fine 
Lisbon sugar, each 2) lbs. ; candied orange, lemon or citron rind, 8 
to 16 oz. ; boiled lemons, 2 large ; rinds of two others, grated ; salt,

rather more of ginger ; good sherry or Madeira, | pint ; brandy, i 
pint. 

Obi,— The lemons will be sufficiently boiled in from one hour to 
one and a quarter. 

SUPBRLATIVB MINCEMEAT. 

Take four large lemons, with their weight of golden pippins pared 
and cored, of jar-raisins, currants, candied citron and orange-rind, 
and the finest suet, and a fourth part more of pounded sugar. Boil 
the lemons tender, chop them small, but be careful first to extract 
all the pips ; add them to the other ingredients, after all have been 
prepared wi& great nicety, and mix the whole toell with from three 
to i&ur glasses of good brandy. Apportion salt and spice by the 
preceding receipt, n e think that the weight of one lemon, in meat, 
unproves this mixture ; or, in lieu of it, a small quantity of crushed 
znacaroons added just before it is baked. 

MI^'CE PIES, (entremets.) 

Butter some tin pattypans well, and Ime them evenly with fine 
puff paste rolled thin ; fill them with mincemeat, moisten the edges 
of the covers, which should be nearly a quarter of an inch thick, 
dose the pies carefully, trim off the superfluous paste, make a small 
aperture m the centre of the crust with a fork or the point of a knife, 
ice the pies or not, at pleasure, and bake them half an hour in a well- 
heated but not fierce oven : lay a paper over them when they are 
partially done, should they appear likely to take too much colour.

THE monitor's TART, OR TOURTB A LA JVDD. 

Put into an enamelled stewpan, or into a delicately dean saucepan, 
three quarters of a pound of well*flavoured apples, weighed after 
they are pared and cored ; add to them firom three to four ounces of 
rK>unded sugar, an ounce and a half of fresh butter cut small, and 
half a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, or the lightly grated rind of 
a small lemon. Let them stand over, or by the side of a gentle fire 
until they begin to soften, and toss them now and then to mingle the 
whole well, but do not stir them with a spoon; they should all re- 
main unbroken and rather firm. Turn them into a dish, and let 
them become cold. Divide three-auarters of a pound of good light 
paste into two equal portions ; roll out one quite thin and round, 
flour an oven-leaf and lay it on, as the tart cannot so well be moved 
after it is made ; place the apples upon it in the form of a dome, but 
leave a clear space of an inch or more round the edge ; moisten this 
with white of eggy and press the remaining half of the paste (which 
should be rolled out to the same size, and laid carefully over the 
apples) closely upon it : they should be well secured, that the syrup 
from the fruit may not burst through. Whisk the white of an e^ 
to a froth, brush it over the tart witn a paste brush or a small bunS 
of feathers, siil sugar thickly over, and then strew upon it some 
almonds blanched and roughly chopped ; bake the tart in a 
moderate oven from thirty-five to forty-five minutes. It may be 
filled with peaches, or apricots, half stewed like the apples, or 
with cherries merely rolled in fiine sugar ; or with the pastry cream 
of page 173.

PUDDING PIES, (entremets,) 

This form of pastry (or its name at least) is, we believe, peculiar 
to the coanty or Kent, where it is made in abundance, and eaten by 
all classes of people during Lent. Boil for fifteen minutes three 
ounces of ground rice* in a pint and a half of new milk, and when 
taken from the fire stir into it three ounces of butter and four of 
sugar ; add to these six well-beaten eggs, a grain or two of salt, and 
a flavouring of nutmeg or lemon-rind at pleasure. When the mix- 
ture is nea^y cold, line some lar^e pattypans or some saucers with 
thin puff paste, fill them with it three parts full, strew the tops 
thickly with currants which have been cleaned and dried, and bake 
the pudding-pies from fifteen to twenty minutes in a gentle oven. 

Milk, li pint; ground rice, 3 oz. : 1^ minutes. Butter, 3 oz. ; 
sugar, i lb. ; nutmeg or lemon-rind ; eggs, 6 ; currants, 4 to 6 oz. 
15 to 30 minutes. 



PUDDING PIES. 

(il commoner kind.) 

One quart of new milk, five ounces of ground rice, butter, one

nutmeg grated, a pinch of salt, four large eggs, and three ounces of 
currants. 

COCOA-NUT CHEESE-CAKES. (eNTREMETS.) 

(Jamaica Receipt) 

Break carefully the shell of the nut, that the liquid it contains 
may not escape.-j" Take out the kernel, pare thinly off the dark 
skin, and grate the nut on a delicately clean grater ; put it, with its 
-weight of pounded sugar, and its own milk, or a couple of spoonsful 
or rather more of water, into a silver or block-tin saucepan, or a very 
small copper stewpan perfectly tinned, and keep it gently stirred over 
a quite clear fire until it is tender: it will sometimes require an 
bourns stewing to make it so. When a little cooled, add to the nut, 
and beat well with it, some eggs properly whisked and strained, and 
the grated rind of half a lemon. Line some patt3rpan8 with fine 
paste, put in the mixture, and bake the cheese-cakes from thirteen 
to fifteen minutes. 

Grated cocoa-nut, 6 oz. ; sugar, 6 oz. ; the milk of the nut, or of

06«.— We have found the cheese-cakes made with these propor- 
tions very excellent indeed, but shoidd the mixture be considered 
too sweet, another egg or two can be added, and a little brandy 
also. With a spoonful or two more of liquid too, the nut would 
become tender in a shorter time 

COMMON LEMON TARTLETS. 

Beat four eggs until they are exceedingly light, add to them 
gradually four ounces of pounded sugar, and whisk these together 
for five minutes ; strew lightly in, if it be at hand, a dessertspoonful 
of potato flour, if not, of common flour well dried and sifted,* then 
throw into the mixture by slow degrees, three ounces of good 
butter, which should be dissolved, but only just luke-warm : beat 
the whole well, then stir briskly in, the strained juice and the 
grated rind of one lemon and a half. Line some pattypans with fine 
pufi'-paste rolled very thin, fill them two-thirds full, and bake the 
tartlets about twenty minutes, in a moderate oven. 

Eggs, 4 ; sugar, 4 oz. ; potato-flour, or common flour, 1 dessert- 
spoonful ; butter, 3 oz. ; juice and rind of 1^ full-sized lemon: 
kmked 15 to 20 minutes. 



Blanch and pound to the finest possible paste, four ounces of fine 
fresh Jordan almonds, with a few drops of lemon-juice or water, 
then mix with them, very gradually indeed, six fresh, and thoroughly 
well-whisked eggs ; throw in by degrees twelve ounces of pounded 
sugar, and beat the mixture without intermission all the time ; add 
then the finely grated rinds of four small, or of three large lemons, 
and afterwards, by very slow degrees, the strained juice of all. 
When these ingredients are perfectly blended, pour to them in small 
portions, four ounces of just liquefied butter (six of clarified if 
exceedingly rich cheese-cakes are wished for), and again whisk the 
mixture lightly for several minutes; thicken it over the fire like 
boiled custard, and either put it into small pans or jars for storing,t 
or fill with it, one^ third fiill, some pattypans lined with the finest 
paste; place lightly on it a layer of apricot, orange, or lemon- 
marmalade, and on this pour as much more of the mixture. Bake 
the cheese-cakes from fifteen to twenty minutes in a moderate oven. 
They are very good without the layer of preserve. 

* A few ratifias, or three or four macaroons rolled to powder, or a stale spoof^ 
or Naples biscuit or two, reduced to the finest crumbs, may be substltatcrd Sot 
either of these : more lemon, too, can be added to the taste. 

•f This preparation will make excellent fancJwneite*^ or pa6ti7-«andwiches. It 
win not curdle if gently boiled for two or three minutes (anid stirred withouf 
ceasing), and it may be long kept afterwards.

APPEL KRAPFEN. 

{German Receipt*) 

Boil down three-quarters of a pound of good apples with four 
ounces of pounded sugar, and a small glass of white wine, or the 
strained juice of a lemon ; when they are stewed quite to a pulp, 
keep them stirred until they are thick and dry; then mix them 
gradually with four ounces of almonds, beaten to a paste, or very 
finely chopped, two ounces of candied orange or lemon-rind shred 
extremely small, and six ounces of jar raisins stoned and quartered : 
to these the Germans add a rather high flavouring of cinnamon, 
which is a very favourite spice with them, but a grating of nutmeg, 
and some fresh lemon-peel, are, we think, preferable tor this com- 
position. Mix all the ingredients well together; roll out some 
butter-crust a full back-of-knife thickness, cut it into four-inch 
squares, brush the edges to the depth of an inch round with beaten 
egg, fill them with the mixture, lay another square of paste on each, 
press them very securely together, make, with the point of a knife, a 
small incision in the top of each, glaze them or not at pleasure, and 
bake them rather slowly, that the raisins may have time to become 
tender. They are very good. The proportion of sugar must be 
regulated by the nature of the fruit ; and that of the almonds can be 
diminished when it is thought too much. A delicious tart of the 
kind is made by substituting for the raisins and candied orange-rind, 
two heaped tablespoonsful of very fine apricot jam. 

CRiME PATISSliRB; OR PABTRT CREAM. 

To one ounce of fine flour add, very gradually, the beaten yolks of 
three fresh eggB ; stir to them briskly, and in small portions at first, 
three-quarters of a pint of boiling cream, or of cream and new milk 
mixed ; then turn the whole into a clean stewpan, and stir it over a 
very gentle fire until it is quite thick, take it ofl\ and stir it well up 
and round ; replace it over the fire, and let it just simmer from .nix 
to eight minutes ; pour it into a basin, and add to it inunediately a 
couple of ounces of pounded sugar, one and a half of fresh butter, 
cut small, or clarified, and a spoonful of the store mixture of page 
153, or a little sugar which has been rubbed on the rind of a lemon. 
The cream is rich enough for common use without further addition ; 
but an ounce and a half of ratifias, crushed almost to powder with a 
paste-roller improves it much, and they should be mixed with it for 
the receipt which follows.

SMALL VOLS-AU-YENTS, A LA PARXSIENNE. (eNTREHETS.) 

Make some small voU^au-vents by the directions of page 361, 
either in the usual way, or with the rings of paste placed upon the 
rounds. Ice the edges as soon as they are taken from the oven, by 
Billing fine sugar thickly on them, and then holding a salamander or 
heated shovel over them, until it melts and forms a sort of pale 
barley-sugar glaze. Have ready, and quite hot, some ereme patis- 
siere^ made as above ; fill the lools-au-venU with it, and send them to 
table instantly. These will be found very good without the icing 

PASTRY SANDWICHES. 

Divide equally in two, and roll off square and as thin as possible, 
some rich puff paste ; * lav one half on a buttered tin, or copper 
oven-leaf, and spread it lightly with fine currant, strawberry or

beat the mixture a little, and put it into pattypans lined with fine 
paste : they should be only three parts filled. Bake the tartlets from 
ten to twelve minutes. 

RASPBERRY PUFFS. 

Boll out thin some fine puff-paste, cut it in rounds or squares of 
equid size, lay some raspberry jam into each, moisten the edges of the 
paste, fold and press them together, and bake the puffs from fifteen 
to eighteen minutes. Strawberry, or any other jam will serve for 
them equally well. 

CREAMED TARTLETS. 

Line some patt3rpan8 with very fine i>aste|, and put into each a layer

this icing lightly over the tartlets, and bake them in a gentle oven

SOUFFLis, 

Thb admirable lightness* and delicacy of a well-made sauflS render 
it generally a Tery favourite dish, and it is now a fashionable one 
also. It may be greatly varied in its composition, but in all cases 
must be served the very instant it is taken from the oven ; and even 
in passing to the dining-room it should, if possible, be prevented 
from sinking by a heated iron or salamander held above it A 
common soume-pan may be purchased for four or five shillings, but 
those of silver or plated metal, which are of the form shown at the 
conunencement of this chapter, are of course expensive ; the part in 
which the souffle is baked is placed within the more ornamental dish 
when it is drawn from the oven. A plain, round, cake-mould, with

a strip of imting paper six inches high, placed inside the rim, will 
answer on an emei^ncy to bake a souffle in. The following recdpt 
will serve as a g^ide for the proper mode of making it : the process 
is always the same whether the principal ingredient be whole rice 
boiled very tender in milk and pressed tnrough a sieve, bread-crumbs 
soaked as for a pudding and worked through a sieve also, arrow-root, 
potato-flour, or aught else of which light puddings in general are 
made. 

Take from a pint and a half of new milk or of cream sufficient to 
mix four ounces of flour of rice to a perfectly smooth batter ; put 
the remainder into a very dean, well-tinned saucepan or stewpan, 
and when it boils, stir the rice briskly to it ; let it simmer, keeping 
it stirred all the time, for ten minutes, or more should it not be veiy 
thick ; then mix well with it two ounces of fresh butter, one and a 
half of pounded sugar, and the grated rind of a fine lemon (or let 
the suffar which is used for it be well rubbed on the lemon before it 
is crushed to powder) ; in two or three minutes take it from the fire, 
and beat ouickly and carefully to it by degrees the yolks of six 
eggs ; whisk the whites to a very firm solid froth, and when the pan 
is buttered, and all else quite ready for the oven, stir them gently to 
the other ingredients ; pour the souffle immediately into the pan and 
place it in a moderate oven, of which keep the door closed for a 
quarter of an hour at least. When the souffle has risen very high, 
is of a fine colour, and quite done in the centre, which it will be 
in from half to three-quarters of an hour, send it instantly to table. 
The exact time for baking it depends so much on the oven that it 
cannot be precisely specific We have known quite a small one not 
too much iMiked in forty-five minutes in an iron oven ; but generally 
less time will suffice for them : the heat, however, should always be 
moderate. 

New milk or cream, l\ pint ; flour of rice, 4 oz. ; fresh butter, 
2 oz. ; pounded sugar, H oz. ; eggs, 6 ; grain of salt ; rind, 1 lemon 
30 to 45 minutes. 

Ohs. I. — The souffle may be flavoured with vanilla, orange-flowers, 
or aught else that is liked. Chocolate and coffiae also may be used 
for it with soaked bread : a very strong infusion of the last, and an 
ounce or two of the other, melted with a little water, are to be added

Ohs. 2.— A souffle is commonly served in a dinner of ceremony as 
a remove of the second-course roast ; but a good plan for this, as 
for a fondu^ is to have it quickly handed round, instead of bemg 
placed upon the table.

not be sufficiently fresh to 3neld it by this means, pare it off in the 
thinnest possible strips and infuse it by the side of the fire in the 
cream of which the souffli is to be made. Should the first method 
be pursued, crush the sugar to powder and dry it a little before it is 
added to the other ingredients. Blend very smoothly two ounces 
of potato-fiour with a quarter of a pint of milk, and pour boiling to 
them a pint of good cream ; stir the mixture in a large basin or bowl 
until it thickens, then throw in a grain of salt, two ounces of fresh 
butter ju«>^. dissolved in a small saucepan, and the sugar which has 
been rubbed on the citron ; or should the rind have l^en pared, the 
same weight some of which is merely pounded. Add next, by 
degrees, the thoroughly whisked yolks of six fresh eggs, or seven 
should they be very small. Beat the whites lightly and quickly 
until they are snfiiciently firm to remain standing in points when 
dropped from the whisk; mix them with the other ingredients at 
the mouth of the oven, but without heating them ; fill the smffli' 
pan less than half full ; set it instantly into the oven, which should 
be gentle, but not exceedingly slow, dose the door immediately, and 
do not open it for fifteen or twenty minutes: in from thirty to 
fc»rty the souffle will be ready for table unless ttie oven should be 
very cool r a fierce degree of*^ heat will have a most unfavourable 
effect upon it. 

Rind of half citron (that of a Seville orange may be substituted 
on occasions); sugar, 2} oz. ; cream, 1 pint; potato-flour, 2 oz.; 
milk, ^ pint ; butter, 2 oz. ; yolks and white of 6 large or of 7 small 
eggs : 30 to 40 minutes, or more in very slow oven. 

0h9. — ^The fresh citron would appear to be brought as yet but 
very sparingly into the English market, though it may sometimes 
be procured of first-rate fruiterers. Nothing can well be finer than 
its highly aromatic flavour, which is infinitely superior to that of 
any other fruit of its species that we have ever tasted. We have 
had delicious preparations made too from the young green citron 
when extremely small, of which we may have occasion to speak 
elsewhere. 

A FONDUy OR CHEESE SOUFFli. 

Mix to a smooth batter, with a quarter of a pint of new milk, two 
ounces of potato-flour, arrow-root, or tou$ les nuns ; pour boiling to 
tbem three-quarters of a pint more of milk, or of cream in pre- 
ference : stir them well together, and then throw in two ounces of 
butter cut small. When this is melted, and well-beaten into the 
mixture, add the well-whisked yolks of four large or of five small 
eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt, something less of cayenne, and three 
ounces of lightly-grated cheese, Parmesan or Englisn, or equal parts 
of both. Whisk the whites of the eggs to a quite firm and solid 
froth ; then proceed, as for a souffle ^ to mix and bake the fondu 

20 minutes.

0BSERYATI0N8 ON OHLBTS, FRITTERS^ &C, 

The composition and nature of a soufflSy as we have shown, are 
altogether dififerent, but there is no difficulty in making good omlets, 
pancakes, or fritters ; and aa they may be expeditiously prepared and 
served^ they are oflen a Tery convenient resource when, on short 
notice, an addition is required to a dinner. The eggs for all of them 
should be well and lightly whisked; the lard n>r frying batter 
should be extremely pure in flavour, and quite hot when the fritters 
are dropped in ; the batter itself should be smooth as cream, and it 
should be briskly beaten the instant before it is used. All fried 
pastes should be perfectly drained from the fat before they are 
served, and sent to table promptly when they are ready. Eggs 
may be dressed in a multiplicity of ways, but are seldom more 
relished in any form than in a well-made and expeditiously served 
omlet. This may be plain, or seasoned with minced herbs and a 
very little etMshalot, when the last is liked, and is then called an 
" Omlette aux finei herbes;" or it may be mixed with minced ham, 
or grated cheese ; in any case, it should be light, thick, full-tasted, 
Kad fried only on one side ; if turned in the pan, as it frequently is in 
England, it will at once be flattened and rendered tough. Should 
the slight rawness which is sometimes found in the middle of the 
inside, when the omlet is made in the French way, be objected to, a 
heated shovel, or a salamander, may be held over it for an instant, 
before it is folded on the dish. The pan for frying it should be 
quite small ; for if it be composed of four or five eggs only, and then 
put into a large one, it will necessarily spread over it and be thin, 
which would render it more like a pancake than an omlet ; the only 
partial remedy for this, when a pan of proper size cannot be had, is 
to raise the handle of it high, and to keep the opposite side close 
down to the fire, which will confine the eggs into a smaller space. 
No gravy should be poured into the dish with it, and indeed, if 
properly made, it will require none. Lard b preferable to butter for 
frying batter, as it renders it lighter ; but it must not be used for 
omlets. 

A COMMON OMLET. 

Six egss are sufficient for an omlet of moderate size. Let them be 
very fresh ; break them singly and carefully ; clear them in the way 
we have already pointed out in the introduction to boiled puddings, 
or when they are sufficiently whisked pour them through a sieve, 
and resume the beating until they are very light Add to them 
from half to a whole teaspoonful of salt, and a seasoning of pepper. 
Dissolve in a small frying-pan a couple of ounces of butter, pour in 
the e^gs, and as soon as the omlet is well risen and firm Uiroughout, 
slide It on to a hot dish, fold it together like a turnover, and serve it 
immediately ; from five to seven minutes will fry it

AN OMLKTTB SOUFFLiE. SECOND COURSE REMOTE OF ROAST.* 

Separate, as they are broken, the whites from the yolks of six fine 
fresh eggs ; beat these last thoroughly, first by themselves and then 
with four tablespoonsful of dry, white sifted sugar, and the rind of 
half a leraon grated on a fine grater. Whish the whites to a solid 
froth, and just before the omlet is poured into the pan, mix them 
well, but hghtly, with the yolks. Put four ounces of fresh butter 
into a veiy small delicately clean omlet or frying pan, and as soon as 
it is all dusolved, add the eggs and stir them round that they may 
absorb it entirely. When the under side is just set, turn the omlet 
into a well-buttered dish, and send it to a tolerably brisk oven. 
From five to ten minutes will bake it ; and it must be served the 
infant it is taken out ; carried, indeed, as quickly as possible to table 
from the oven. It will have risen to a great height, but will sink 
and become heavy in a very short space of time : if sugar be sifted 
over it, let it be done with the utmost expedition. 

Sggs, 6 ; sugar, 4 tablespoonsful ; rind, ^ lemon ; butter, 4 oz. : 
omlet baked, 5 to 10 minutes. 

Ohs. — ^This ondette may be served on a Liyer of apricot-marmalade, 
which must be spread over the dish in which it is to be baked, and 
aent to table before the omlette is turned into it. 



PLAIN COMMON FRITTKRS. 

Mix with three well-whisked eggs a quarter of a pint of milk, and 
strain them through a fine sieve ; add tnem gradually to three large 
tablesnoonsful of flour, and thin the batter with as much more milk 
as will bring it to the consistence of cream ; beat it up thoroughly at 
the moment of using it, that the fritters may be fight. Drop it 
in small portions from a spouted jug or basin into boiling lard ; 
when lightly coloured on one side, turn the fritters, drain them well 
from the lard as they are lifted out, and serve them very quickly. 
They are eaten generally with fine sugar, and orange or lemon juice : 
the first of these may be sifted quickly over them after they are 
dished, and the oranges or lemons halved or quartered, and sent to 
table with them. The lard used for frying them should be fresh and 
pure-flavoured : it renders them more crisp and light than butter, 
and is, therefore, better suited to the purpose. These fritters may be 
a£;reeably varied by mingling with the batter just before it is used, 
two or three ounces of well cleaned and well dried currants, or three

PANCAKES. 

These may be made with the same batter as fritters, if it be suffi- 
ciently thinned with an additional egg or two, or a little milk or 
cream, to spread quickly over the pan : to fry them well, this ought 
to be small. When the batter is ready, heat the pan over a dear 
fire and rub it with butter in every part, then pour in sufficient 
batter to spread over it entirely, and let the pancake be very thin : 
in this case it will reqtiire no turning, but otherwise it must be 
tossed over with a sudden jerk of the pan, in which the cook who is 
not somewhat expert will not always succeed; therefore the safer 
plan is to make them so thin that they will not require this. Keep 
them hot before the fire or in the stove-oven until a sufficient 
number are ready to send to table, then proceed with a second 
supply, as they should always be quickly served. Either pile them 
one on the other with sugar strewed between, or spread quickly over 
them, as they are done, some apricot or other good preserve, and roll 
tiiem up : in the latter case, th^y may be neatly divided and dished 
in a circle. Clotted cream is sometimes sent to table with them. A 
richer kind of pancake may be made with a pint of cream, or of 
cream and new milk mixed, five eggs or their yolks only, a couple of 
ounces of flour, a little pounded cinnamon or lemon-rind rasped on 
sugar and scraped into them, with two ounces more of pounded 
sugar, and two ounces of clarified butter : a few ratifias rolled to 
powder may be added at pleasure, or three or four macaroons. 

From 4 to 5 minutes. 

PBITTERfl OF CAKE AlO) PUDDING. 

Gut plain pound, or rice cake, or rich seed cake, into small square 
slices half an inch thick; trim away the crust, fry them slowly a 
light brown in a small quantity of fresh butter, and spread over 
them when done a layer of apricot-jam, or of any other preserve, 
and serve them immediately. These fritters are improved oy being 
moistened with a little good cream before they are fried : they must 
then be sligbtlv floured. Cold plum-pudding diced down as thick 
as the cake, and divided into portions of equal size and good form, 
then dipped into French or English batter and gently fried, will also 
make an, agreeable variety of fritter. Orange marmalade and Devon- 
shire cream may be served in separate layers on the seed cake fritterh 
The whole of the above may be cut of uniform size and shaped with 
a round cake-cutter.

MINCEMEAT FRITTERS. 

With half a pound of mincemeat mix two ounces of fine bread- 
crumbs (or a tablespoonful of flour), two eg^ well beaten, a ad the 
strained juice of half a small lemon. Mix these well, and drop the 
flitters with a dessertspoon into plenty of very pure lard or fresh 
butter; fry them from seven to eight minutes, drain them on a 
napkin or on white blotting paper, and send them very hot to table : 
they should be ouite small.

parts done, add to it two ounces of pounded sugar, and one of fresh 
butter, a grain of salt, and the grated rind of hidf a small lemon. 
Let it cool in the saucepan, and when only just warm, mix with it 
thoroughly three ounces of currants, four of apples chopped fine, a 
teaspoonful of flour, and three large or four small well-beaten eggs. 
Drop the mixture in small fritters, fry them in butter from five to 
seven minutes, and let them become quite firm on one side before 
they are turned : do this with a slice. Drain them as they are taken 
up, and sift white sugar over them after they are dished.

1 teaspoonful; a little salt; eggs, 3 large, or 4 sixiall: 5 to 7 
minutes. 

RHUBARB FRITTERS. 

The rhubarb for these should be of a good sort, qmckly gro^vn, 
and tender. Fare, cut it into equal len^hs, and throw it into the 
French batter of page 130 ; with a fork lilt the stalks separately, and 
put them into a pan of boiling lard or butter : in from five to six 
minutes they will be done. Drain them well and dish them on a 
napkin, or pile them high without one, and strew sifted sugar 
plentifully over them : they should be of a very light brown, and 

Suite dry and crisp. The voung stalks look well when left the 
mgth of the dish in whicn they are served^ and only slightly 
encrusted with the batter, through which they should be merely 
drawn. 

^ to 6 minutes.

APPLE, PEACH, APRICOT, OR ORAKGB FRITTERS. 

Pare and cce without dividinff the apples, slice them in rounds 
the full size of the fruit, dip them into the same batter as that 
directed for the preceding fritters, fry them a pale brown, and let 
them be very dry. Serve them heaped high upon a folded napkin, 
and strew sirted sugar over them. After having stripped the outer 
rind from the oranges, remove carefully the white inner skin, and in 
slicing them take out the pips ; then dip them into the batter and 
proceed as for the apple fritters. The peaches and apricots should be 
merely skinned, halved, and stoned bdbre they are drawn through 
the batter, unless they should not be fully ripe, when they must fint 
be stewed tender in a thin syrup. 

8 to 12 minutes 

BRIOCHE FRITTERS. 

The brioche-paste,* when good, makes very superior eannelons 
and fritters : it is, we should say, better in this form than in that of 
the bun or cake, in which it is seen so commonly abroad. Make it, 
for the fritters, into very small balls ; roil them quite thin, put a tea- 
spoonfVil or less of rich preserve into each, moisten tiie edges and fold 
tiie paste together securely, or with a maU tin shape cut as many 
rounds of the brioche as are wanted, place some preserve in the 
centre of one half of these, moisten the edges, lay the remainder 
lightly over them, press them care^ly together and restore them to 
a ffood form with the tin-cutter, by trimming them with it t« their 
onginal size ; glide them gently into a pan of boiling lard, and fry 
them from four and a hdf to five minutes. Serve them very hot, 
crisp, and dry, piled on a folded napkin. The eannelons are made 
like those of paste, and are very good. They are sometimes filled 
with lemon-cheesecake mixture, or with Madame Wemer*8 (see 
Chapter XVIH.) 

Fritters, 4}^ to 5 minutes; eannelons, 5 to 6 minutes. 

POTATO FRITTERS. (eNTREMETS.) 

The same mixture as for potato puddings. Chapter XXL, if 
dropped in small portions into boiling butter, and fried until brown 
on both sides, will make potato-fritters. Half the proportion of in- 
gredieuts will be quite sufficient for a dish of these. 

LEJION FRITTERS. (eNTRKMETS.) 

Mix with six ounces of very fine bread-crumbs four of beef suet 
minced as small as possible, four ouAces of pounded sugar, a small 
tablespoonful of flour, four whole eggs well and lightly whisked, ttod 
the grated rind of one large or of two small lemons, with hidf or 
Che whole of the juice, at choice ; but before this last is stined io,

add a spoonfiil or two of milk or cream if needed. Fry the mix 
ture in small fritters for five or six minutes. 

CA^^NELONS. (entremets.) 

Roll ont very thin and evenly 
some fine pufi'-paste into a long 
strip of from three to four inches 
wide, moisten the surface with a 
feather dipped in white of egg, 
and cut it into bands of nearly 
two inches wide ; lay some apricot 
or peach marmalade equally along 
these, and fold the paste twice ^£ 
over it, close the ends carefully, 
and when all are ready, slide them gently into a pan of boiling 
lard;* as soon as they begin to brown, raise the pan from the 
fire that they may not take too much colour before the paste is 
done quite through. Five minutes will fry them. Drain them well, 
and dry them on a soft cloth before the fire ; dish them on a napkin, 
and place one layer crossing another, or merely pile them high in the 
centre. If well made, and served of a light brown and very dry, 
these cannelons are excellent : when lard if objected to butter may be 
used instead, but the paste will then bo somewhat less light. Only 
lard of the purest quality wiU answer for the purpose. 

6 minutes. 

CAN17EL0NS OP BRIOCHE PASTE. (eKTREMETS.) 

Proceed exactly as for the cannelons above, substituting the 
brioche for the puff-paste, and rolliug it as thin as possible, as it 
swells very much in the pan. Fine sugar may be sifted over these 
after they are dried and dished. 

4 or 5 minutes. 

CROi^UETTES OF RICE. 

Wipe very clean, in a dry 
cloth, seven ounces of rice, 
put it into a dean stew-pan, 
and pour on it a quart of

FINER CROQUETTES OF RICE. (eNTREMETS.) 

Swell the rice in thin cream, or in new milk strongly flavoured 
with vanilla or cocoa-nut ; add the same ingredients as m the fore- 
going receipt, and when the rice is cold, form it into balls, and with 
the tnumb of the right hand hollow them sufficiently to admit in the 
centre a small portion of peach jam, or of apricot marmalade ; dose 
the rice well over it ; e^, crumb, and fry the cro(^uette8 as usuaL 
As, from the difference of quality, the same proportions of rice and 
milk will not always produce the same effect, the cook must use her 
discretion in adding, should it be needed, sufficient liquid to soften 
the rice perfectly : but she must bear in mind that if not boiled ex- 
tremely thick and dry, it will be difficult to make it into cro- 
quettes.* 

SAVOURY CROQUETTES OP RICE. (eNTR^E.) 

These are made with the same preparation as the casserole of rioe 
of Chapter XVIII., but it must be boiled very dry, and left to 
become quite cold before it is used. A few spoonsfdl of rich white 
sauce stirred into it when it is nearly tender, will improve it much. 
Form and hollow the croquettes as directed in the last receipt ; fill 
them with a small portion of minced fowl, partridce, or pheasant in 
a thick sauce, or with a stewed oyster or two cut m quarters ; dose 
the rice perfectly over them ; egg, and crumb the croquettes, fry and 
serve them garnished with crisped parsley. French cooks wi^-y 
sometimes a little grated Parmesan cheese witn the rice at the moment 
it is taken from the fire, and roll the croquettes in more after they 
are egged ; they press this on and dip them again in egg, and then 
into the crumbs. Raise the pan high above the fire when the cro-

thoroughly soft but firm mass; which would, perhaps, be rather too dry for

RISSOLES. (entree.) 

This is the French name for small fried pastry of yarioos forms, 
filled with meat or fish previously cooked ; thev may be made with 
hriochey or with light pufi^-paste, either of which must be rolled ex- 
tremely thin. Cut it with a small round cutter fluted or plain ; put 
a little rich mince, or good pounded meat, in the centre, and moisten 
the edges, and press them securely together that they may not burst 
open in the frymg. The rissoles may be formed like small patties, 
by laying a second round of paste over the meat, or like cannelojis ; 
they may, likewise, be brushed with egg, and sprinkled with ver- 
micelli, broken small, or with fine crumbs. Tney are sometimes 
made in the form of croquettes^ the paste being gathered round the 
meat, which must form a ball.* 

In frying them, adopt the same plan as for the croquettes^ raising 
the pan as soon as the paste is lightly coloured. Serve all these 
fried dishes well drained, and on a napkin. 

From 5 to 7 minutes, or less. 

VERY SAVOURY ENGLISH RISSOLES. (ENTREE.) 

Make the forcemeat No. 1, Chapter VUJL., sufficiently firm with 
unbeaten yolk of egg, to roll rather thin on a well-floured board ; 
cut it into very small rounds, put a little pounded chicken in the 
centre of one half, moistening the edges with water, or white of egg, 
lay the remaining rounds over these, close them securely, and fry 
them in butter a fine light brown ; drain and dry them well, and 
heap them in the middle of a hot dish, upon a napkin folded flat : 
these rissoles may be egged and crumbed before they are fried. 

fiMALL FRIED BREAD PATTIES^ OR GROUSTADES OF YARIOUB 
KINDS. 

These may be either sweet or savoury, and many of them may be 
80 promptly prepared, that they ofier a ready resource when an

very crisp, and of a fine equal gold colour, either in clarified marrow, 
for which we give our own receipt, or in really good butter.

or two more of milk over them at interrals, but not sufficient to 
cause them to break; brush them with egg, rasp the crust of the 
rolls over them, fry and drain them well, fill them with a good 
mince, or with stewed mushrooms or oysters, and serre them veir

warm apricot marmalade, cherry-jam, or other good preserve.

TO PREPARE BEEF MARROW FOR FRYING CROUSTADES^ 
SAVOURY TOASTS^ &C 

At a season when butter of pure flavour is often procured with 
difficulty, beef-marrow, carefully clarified, is a valuable substitute 
for it ; and, as it is abundantly contained in the joints which are in 
constwt request for soup-making, it is of slight comparative cost 
in a well managed kitchen. It is often thrown into the stock- 
pot by careless or indolent cooks, instead of being rendered available 
for the many purposes to which it is admirably adapted. Take it 
from the bones as fresh as possible, put it into a white jar, and melt 
it with a very gentle degree of heat at the mouth of the oven, or by 
the side of the stove, taking all precaution to prevent its being 
smoked or discoloured; strain it on, through a very fine sieve or 
muslin, into a clean jpan or pans, and set it aside for use. It will be 
entirely flavourless if prepared with due care and attention ; but, if 
dissolved with too great a degree of heat, it will acquire the taste 
almost of drip{>ing. A small quantity of fine salt may be sprinkled 
into the pan with it when it is used K>r frying. 

SMALL OROUSTADES; OR BREAD PATTIES^ DRESSED IK MARROW* 

{Author^s Receipt^ 

Cut very evenly, from a firm stale loaf, slices nearly an inch and 
a half thick, and with a pl^ or fluted paste-cutter of between two 
and three inches wide press out the number of patties required, 
loosening them gently from the tin, to prevent their breaking ; then, 
with a plain cutter, scarcely more than half the size, mark out the 
space which is afterwards to be hollowed from it. Melt some daii- 
fied beef-marrow in a small saucepan or frying-pan, and, when it 
begins to boil, put in the patties, and fry them gently until they are 
equally coloured of a pale golden brown. In li&ng them from the 
pan, let the marrow (or butter) drain well from them ; take out the 
rounds which have been marked on the tops, and scoop out part of 
the inside crumb, but leave them thick enough to contain securely 
the gravy of the preparation put into them. Fill them with any 
good patty-meat, and serve them very hot on a napkin.

in either case, to place them on a warm sneet of double white blot-

fluous rat. A rich mince, with a thick, well-adhering sauce, either

may be left on ; mark each slice with a smaU cutter in the centre, 
dip the croustades into butter or marrow, fry them lightly, or bake 
them without permitting them to become yery hard ; empty, and 
then fill them ; dish them without a napkin, and pour some good 
brown grayy round, but not aver them. 

Obs. — From being cooked without butter, these and the preceding 
patties are adapted to a Jewish table. 

CURRIED TOASTS WITH ANCHOYIES. 

Fry lightly, in good butter, clarified marrow, or yery pure oliye 
oO, some slices of bread, free from crust, of about half an inch thick, 
and two inches and a half square ; lift them on to a dish, and spread 
8 not very thick layer of Captain White's currie-paste on the top ; 
place them in a gentle oyen K)r three or four minutes, then lay two 
or three fillets of anchoyies on each, replace them in the oyen for a 
couple of minutes, and send them immediately to table. Their pun- 
gency may be heightened by the addition of cayenne pepper, when a 
ve^ hot preparation is liked. 

Obs. — ^We haye spoken but slightly in our chapter of curries of 
Captain White's currie-paste, though for many years we haye had it 
used in preference to any other, and always found it excellent Lat- 
terly, howeyer, it has been obtained with rather less facility than 
when attention was first attracted to it. The last which we procured 
directed, on the label of the jar, that orders for it should be sent per 
post to 83, Copenhagen Street, Islington. It may, howeyer, be 
procured without doubt from any good purveyor of sauces and other 
condiments. It is sold in jars of all sizes, the price of the smallest 
being one-and-sixpence. We certainly think it much superior to 
any of the others which we haye tested, its flavour being peculiarly 
agreeable. 

TO FILLET ANCHOYIES, 

Drain them well firom the pickle, take aS the heads and fins, lay 
them separately on a plate, and scrape off the skin entirely ; then

place them on a clean dish and with a sliarp-edjo;ed knife raise the 
flesh on either side of the back-hone, pasang it from the tail to the 
shonlders, and keeping it nearly flat as it is worked along. DiTide 
each side (or JiUet) in two, and use them as directed for the preceding 
toasts or other purposes. Thej make excellent simple suidwiches 
with slices of br^ and butter only ; but very superior ones whoi 
they are potted or made into anchovy butter. 

SATOURY TOASTS. 

Cut some slices of bread free from crust, about half an inch tiiidc, 
and two inches and a half square ; butter the tops thickly, spread a 
little mustard on them, and then cover them with a deep layer ^ 
grated cheese and of ham seasoned rather highly with cayenne ; frj 
uem in good butter, but do not turn them in the pan ; lift them out, 
and place them in a Dutch oven for three or minutes to dissolve the 
aheese : serve them very hot. 

To 4 tablespoonsful of grated English cheese, an equal portion of 
yery finely minced, or ^ted ham ; but of Parmesan, or Gruy^re, 6 
tablespoons^. Seasomng of mustard and cayenne. 

Ohs, — These toasts, for which we give the original receipt un- 
altered, may be served in the cheese-course of a dimier. Sucn mere 
^ relishes ** as they are called, do not seem to us to demand much of 
our space, or many of them which are very easy of preparation might 
be inserted here : a good cook, however, will easily supply them at 
slight expense. Truffles minced, seasoned, and stewMT tender in 
butter with an eschalot or two, may be served on fried toasts or 
croutons and wiU generally be liked. 

TO CHOOSE HACCARONI AND OTHER ITALIAN PABTIES. 

The Naples maccaroni, of which the ]^ipes are large, and somewhat 
thin, should be selected for the table in preference to the Genoa, 
which is less in size, but more substantial, and better suited to* the 
formation of the various fanciful timbales* for which it is usually 
chosen. We have inserted here no receipts for these, because unless 
very skilfully prepared they are sure to fail, and they are not in 
much request m this country, unless it be at the tables of the 
aristocracy, for which they are prepared by efficient cooks. Of the 
ribbon maccaroni (or lazanges) we have given particulars in the 
pages which follow. The macaronctm, though not much larger than 
a straw, requires much boiling for its size, to render it soft. The 
oelery-maccaroni is made very large and of an ornamental form, but 
in short lengths. It is used oy " professed ** cooks as a sort of crust 
or case for guen^fle-forcemeat, or other expensive preparations of the

same nature. The ring or cut maccaroni is another form given to 
the Italian paste : it may be had at ahnost any good foreign ware- 
house. 

All these pastes should be qf a yellowish tint (by no means whUs 
as one sees them when they are of inferior quuity) ; they should 
also be quite fresh, as thj^ contract a most unpleasant flavour from 
"being too long stored, llie Naples vermicelli, which is much larger 
than any other, may be dressed like maccaroni : by many persons it 
18 also preferred to the smaller varieties for serving in soup. 

TO BOIL MACCARONI. 

We have always found the continental mode of dressing maccaroni 
the best. English cooks sometimes soak it in milk and water for an 
hour or more, before it is boiled, that the pipes may be swollen to 
the utmost, but this is apt to render it pulpv, though its appearance 
may be improved by it. Drop it lightly, and bv degrees, into a large 
pan of fast-boiling water, into which a little salt, and a bit of butter 
the size of a walnut, have previously been thrown, and of which the 
boiling should not be stopped by the addition of the maccarom. In 
about three-quarters of an hour the Naples maccaroni will be suffi- 
ciently tender: every kind should always be perfectly cooked, for 
otherwise it will nrove very indigestible, but the pipes of that 
commonly served snould remain entire. Four it into a large cul- 
lender, and drain the water well firom it. It should be very softly 
boiled after the first minute or two. 

Time of boiling : — Naples maccaroni, about f hour ; Genoa, nearly 
or quite 1 hour ; maearoncini, 20 to 25 minutes ; cut maccaroni, 10 
minutes ; Naples vermicelli (in water), about 20 minutes ; longer in 
Boup, or milk. 

RIBBON MACCARONI.* 

This kind of maccaroni, though more delicate in flavour and much 
more quickly boiled than the pipe maccaroni, is far less frequently 
seen at English tables ; yet it is extremely ^ood in many simple form's 
and very wholesome, therefore well suited to invalids and children 
as well as to persons in health. Drop it gradually into plenty of 
boiling water, and turn it over occasionally that it may be equally 
done. Drain it thoroughly when it is perfectly tender, and serve it 
quiddv either quite plam, to be eaten instead of vegetables or rice ; 
or with a compote of fruit ; or with sugar and cinnamon, or lemon-

maccaroni 
To be boiled 15 to 18 minutes. 



DRESSED MACCARONI. 

After careM and repeated trial of different modes of dreseong 
various kinds of maccaroni, we find that in preparing them with 
Farmesan cheese, unmixed with any of a more mellow nature, there 
is always a chance of failure, from its tendency to gather into lumps ; 
we would therefore recommend the inexperienced reader to substitute 
for it in part, at least, any finely flavoured English cheese ; and the 
better to ensure its blencUng smoothly with tne other ingredients 
(when neither white, nor any other thickened sauce is used with it), 
to dissolve the butter, and to stir to it a small teaspoonful of floor, 
before any liauid is added, then carefully to mix with it the cream, 
or gravy, as oirected for Sauce Taumee, Chapter Y., and to give this 
a boil before the maccaroni and cheese are added : if gently tossed as 
these become hot, the whole will be smooth, and the dieese wiU 
adhere properly to the paste. Four ounces of pipe maccaroni is 
sufficient for a smaU dish, but from six to eight should be prepared 
for a family party where it is liked. The common English mode of 
dressing it is with grated cheese, butter, and cream, or milk. 
French cooks substitute generally a spoonful or two of veiy strong 
rich jellied gravy for tne cream; and the Italians, amongst their 
many other modes of serving it, toss it in rich brown gravy, witl: 
sufficient ffrated cheese to flavour the whole strongly; they send it 
to table also simply laid into a good JEspagnole or brown gravy (that 
drawn from the stufatOy* for example), accompanied hj a plate of 
grated cheese. Another, and an easy mode of dressing it is to boil 
and drain it well, and to put it into a deep dish, strewing grated 
cheese on every layer, and adding bits of fresh butter to it. The 
top, in this case, should be covered with a layer of fine bread-crumbs, 
mixed with ^ated cheese; these should be moistened plentifully 
with clarified butter, and colour given to them in the oven, or 
before the fire ; the crumbs may be omitted, and a layer of cheese 
substituted for them An excellent preparation of maccaroni may 
be made with any well'flavoured, di^ white cheese, which can be 
grated easily, at much less cost than with the Parmesan, which is 
expensive, and in the country not always procurable : and we think 
that the brown gravy and a seasoning of cayenne are great improve- 
ments to it. 

Maccaroni, 6 oz. ; butter, 3 oz. ; Parmesan (or other) cheese, 6 
oz. ; cream, 4 tablespoonsful. 

Obs, — ^Less of butter and cheese can be used by the strict economist

MACCARONI A LA HEINE. 

This is a very excellent and delicate mode of dressing maccaronL 
Boil eight ounces in the nsiial way, and by the time it is sufficiently 
tender, dissolve gently ten ounces of any rich, well flavoured white 
cheese in full three-quarters of a pint of good cream ; add a little 
salt, a rather full seasoning of cayenne, from half to a whole st It- 
spoonful of pounded mace, and a couple of ounces of sweet fresh 
butter. The cheese should, in the first instance, be sliced very 
thin, and taken quite free of the hard part adjoining the rind ; it 
should be stirred in the cream without intermission until it is 
entirely dissolved, and the whole is perfectly smooth : the maccaroni^ 
previously well drained, may then be tossed gently in it, or after it 
IS dished, the cheese may be poured equally over the maccaronL 
The whole, in either case, may be thickly covered before it is sent to 
table, with fine cnunbs of bread fried of a pale gold colour, and 
dried perfectly, either before the fire or in an oven, when such an 
addition is considered an improvement. As a matter of precaution, 
it is better to boil the cream before the cheese is melted in it ; rich 
white sauce, or bSc?iamel^ made not very thick, with an additional 
ounce or two of butter, may be used to vary and enrich this prepa- 
ration. K Parmesan cheese be used for it, it must of course be 
grated ; but, as we have said before, it will not easily blend with the 
other ingredients so as to be smooth. A portion of Stilton, free 
from the blue mould, woidd have a good effect in the present receipt. 
Half the quantitv may be served. 

Maccaroni, ^ lb. ; cheese, 10 oz. ; good cream, f pint (or rich white 
sauce) ; butter, 2 oz. (or more) ; little salty^fine cayenne, and mace. 

BEMOULINA AND POLENTA A l'iTALIENNE. (gOOD.) 

{To seroe instead of MaccaronL} 

Throw into a quart of milk, when it is fast boiling, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and then shake lightly into it 
five ounces of the best semoulina ; stir the muk as this is 
added, and continue to do so from eight to ten minutes, 
letting the mixture boil gently during the time. It 
should be very thick, and great care must be taken to 
prevent its sticking to the saucepan, which should be 
placed over a clear fire on a bar or trivet, but not upon 
the coals. Pour the semoulina, when it is done, into a 
basin, or a plain mould which it will not fill by an inch 
or two, and let it remain some hours in a cool place, that 
it may become perfectly cold ; it will then turn out quite 
solid, and like a pudding in appearance. Cut it with a 
large, sharp carvmg-knue, or a bit of thin wire, into 
half- inch slices ; wash the basin into which it was poured 
at first, and butter it well ; grate from six to eight ounces 
of good cheese (Paimesan, or any other), and mix with it Maize. 




394 MODEBK COOKERY. [chap. xix. 

a half-teaspoonM of cayenne, and twice as much pounded mace ; 
clarify from two to three ounces of fresh butter, and put a small 

Quantity into the basin, strew in a little of the cheese, and then lay in 
[le first slice of the semoulina, on this put a thick layer of the cheese, 
moisten it with some drons of butter, and place the second slice upon 
it ; then more cheese ana butter, and continue thus imtil all the se- 
moulina is replaced in the basin ; put plenty of cheese upon the top, add 
the remainder of the clarified butter, and bake the nuxture for about 
half an hour in a gentle oven. It should be of a fine golden colour 
when served. Turn it carefully into a dish, and send it instantly to 
table. A little rich brown gravy floured round might, to some 
tastes, improve it, but it is excellent without, and may be substituted 
for maccaroni, which it much resembles in flavour. It may be en- 
riched by adding butter to the milk, or by mixing with it a portion 
of cream ; and it may be browned in a Dutch oven, when no other is 
in use. ^ 

In Italy the flour of Indian com, which is much grown there, and 
eaten by all ranks of people, is used for this dish ; but the semoulina 
is perhaps rather better suited to English taste and habits of diet, 
from hems somewhat lighter and more delicate. The maize-flour 
imported irom Italy is sold at the foreign warehouses here under the 
name of polenta^* though that properly speaking is, we believe, a 
boiled or stewed preparation of it, which forms the most common food 
of the poorer classes of the inhabitants of many of the Italian 
states. It seems to us superior in quality to the Indian com flour 
grown in America.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

Aix the ingredients for puddings should 
be fresh and of good quality. It is a 
fedse economy to use for them such as 
have been too long stored, as the slightest 
degree of mustiness or taint in any one 
of the articles of which they are com- 
posed will spoil all that are combined 
"with it. £^ should always be broken 
separately mto a cup before the^ are 
thrown together in the same basm, as a single very bad one will 
occasion the loss of many when this precaution is neglected. They 
should also be cleared from the stxk^s with scrupulous attention, 
either with the point of a small three-pronged fork while they are 
in the cup, or by straining the whole through a fine hair-sieve after 
they are beaten. The perfect sweetness of suet and milk should be 
especially attended to before they are mixed into a pudding, as 
nothinf^ can be more offensiye than the first when it is over-kept, nor 
worse m its effect than the curdling of the milk, which is the certain 
result of its being ever so slightly soured 



S96 MODEBN COOKEBT. [cbap.ZX. 

CnrrautB should be cleaned, and raisins stoned with exceeding care; 
almonds and spices very finely pounded, and the rinds of oranges or 
lemons rasped or grated lightly off, that the bitter part of the skin 
may be avoided, when they are used for this, or for any other dass of 
dSshes ; if pared, they should be cut as thin as possible. 

Custard puddings to have a goid appeunnce, must be simmered 
only but without ceasing; for if boiled in a quick and carelesi 
manner, the surface instep of bein^ smooth and velvety, will be fuU 
of holes, or honey-combed, as it is called, and the whey will flow 
firom it and mingle with the sauce. A thickly-buttered sheet of 
writing-paper should be laid between the custiurd mixture and the 
cloth before it is tied over, or the cover of the mould is closed upon 
it ; and the mould itself or the basin in which it is boiled, and wmch 
should always be quite full, must likewise be well buttered; and 
after it is lined from the water the pudding should be left in it for 
quite five minutes before it is dished, to prevent its breaking or 
spreading about. 

Batter is much lighter when boiled in a cloth, and allowed foil 
room to swell, than when confined in a mould : it should be well 
beaten the instant before it is poured into it, and put into the water 
immediately after it is securely tied. The cloth should be moist and 
thickly floured, and the pudding should be sent to table as expe- 
ditiously as possible after it is done, as it will quickly become heavy 
This applies eaually to all puddings made with paste, which are ren- 
dered uneatable by any delay in serving them after they are ready : 
they should be opened a little at the top as soon as they are taken 
from the boiler or stewpan to permit the escape of the steam from 
within. 

Plum-puddings, which it is customary to boil in moulds, are boUi 
lighter and less dr^, when closely tied in stout cloths well buttered 
and floured, especially when they are made in part with bread ; but 
when this is done, care should be taken not to allow them to bum to 
the bottom of the pan in which they are cooked ; and it is a good 
plan to lay a plate or dish under them, by way of precaution against 
this mischance ; it will not then so much matter whether tibey be 
kept floating or not. It is thought better to mix these entirely (ex- 
cept the liquid portion of them) the day before they are boiled, and 
it IS perhaps an advantage when they are of large size to do so, but 
it is not reallv necessary for small or common ones 

A very little salt improves all sweet puddines, by taking off the 
insipidity, and bringing out the full flavour of me other ingredientSi 
but its presence shoiud not be in the slightest degree perceptible* 
When brandy, wine, or lemon-juice is added to them it should be 
stirred in briskly, and by degrees, quite at last, as it would be likely 
otherwise to curdle the milk or eggs 

Many persons prefer their puddings steamed ; but when this is not 
done, they should be dropped into plenty of boiling water, and be 
kept well covered with it until they are ready to serve ; and the 



CHAP XZ.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 397 

boiling should never be allowed to cease for an instant, for they soon 
become heavy if it be inteminted. 

Pudding and dumpling clotns should not only be kid into plenty 
of water as soon as the^ are taken ofif, and well washed afterwards, 
but it is essential to their perfect sweetness that they should be well 
and quickly dried (in the open air if possible), then folded and kept 
in a clean drawer. 

TO CLEAN CURRANTS FOR PUDDINGS OR CAKES. 

Put them into a cullender, strew a handful of flour over them, and 
rub them gently with the hands to separate the lumps, and to detach 
the stalks ; work them round in the cullender, and shake it well, 
when the small stalks and stones will fall through it. Next pour 
plentv of cold water over the currants, drain and spread them on a 
soft doth, press it over them to absorb the moisture, and then lay 
them on a clean oven-tin, or a lar^e dish, and dry them very 
gradually (or they will become hard), either in a cool oven or before 
the fire, taking care in the latter case that they are not placed 
sufficiently near it for the ashes to fall amongst them. When they 
are perfectly dry, clear them entirely from the remaining stalks, and 
from every stone that may be amongst them. The best mode of de- 
tecting these is to lay the fruit at the far end of a large white dish, or 
sheet of paper, and to pass it lightly, and in very small portions, 
with the fingers, towaros oneseli, examining it closely as this i^ 
done. 

TO STEAM A PUDDING IN A COMMON STEWPAN OR SAUCEPAN. 

Butter and fill the mould or basin as usual'; tie over it, first, a 
well-buttered paper, and then a thin floured cloth or muslm, which 
should be quite small ; gather up and tie the comers, and be careful 
that no part of it, or of the paper, reaches to the water ; pour in from 
two to three inches depth of this, according to the height of tiie 
mould, and when it boils put in the pudding, and press the cover 
of the stewpan closely on ; then boil it gently without ceasing until it 
is done. This is the safer method of boiling all puddings made with 
polenta, or with the American flour of maize ; as well as manj others 
of the custard kind, which are easily spoiled by the admission of 
water to them. As the evaporation diminishes that in the saucepan, 
more, ready-boiUng, must be added if necessary ; and be poured 
carefully down the side of the pan without touching the pudding. 

TO MIX BATTER FOR PUDDIXGS. 

Put the flour and salt into a bowl, and stir them together ; whisk 
the eggs thoroughly, strain them through a fine hair-sieve, and add 
them very gradually to the flour ; for if too much L'quid be poured to 
h at once it will be full of lumps, and it is easy with care to keep the 



398 MODERN COOKERY. [cHA7. XX. 

batter perfectly smootli. Beat it wdl and lightly with the back of a 
strong wooden spoon, and after the egm are added thin it with milk 
to a proper consistence. The whites of the ^gs beaten separately to 
a sohd &oth, and stirred gently into the mixture the instant before it 
is tied up for boiling, or l)efore it is put into the oyen to be baked, 
wiU render it remarkably light. When fruit is added to the batter, 
it must be made thicker than when it is served plain, or it will sink 
to the bottom of the pudding. Batter should never stick to the knife 
when it is sent to table : it will do this both when a sufficient number 
of eggs are not mixed with it, and when it is not enough cooked- 
About four e^gs to the half pound of flour will make it firm enough 
to cut smoothly 

SUET-CRUST^ FOR MEAT OR FRUIT PUDDINGS. 

Clear off the skin from some fresh beef kidney-suet, hold it firmly 
with a fork, and with a sharp knife slice it thin, free it entirely from 
fibre, and mince it veiy fine : six ounces thus prepared will be found 
quite sufficient for a pound of flour. IVfix them well together, add 
half a teaspoonfril of salt for meat puddings, and a third as much for 
fruit ones, and sufficient cold water to n^e the whole into a very 
firm paste ; work it smooth, and roll it out of equal thickness when 
it is used. The weight of suet should be taken after it is minced. 
This crust is so mudi lighter, and more wholesome than that which 
is made with butter, that we cannot refrain from recommending it in 
preference to our readers. Some cooks merely slice the suet in thin 
shavinffs, mix it with the flour, and beat the crust with a paste-roUer, 
until uie flour and suet are perfectly incorporated; but it is better 
minced. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; suet, 12 oz. ; salt, 1 teaspoonful ; water, 1 put. 

BUTTER CRUST FOR PUDDINGS. 

When suet is disliked for crust, butter must suppler its place, but 
there must be no intermixture of lard in paste which is to be boiled. 
Eight ounces to the pound of flour will render it sufficienty rich for 
most eaters, and less wiU generally be preferred ; rich crust of this 
kind being more indigestible by far than that which is baked. The 
butter may be lightly broken into the flour before the water is added 
or it may be laid on, and rolled into the paste as for puff-crust A 
small portion of salt must be added to it always, and for a meat 
pudding the same proportion as directed in the preceding receipt 
For kitchen, or for quite common fiunily puddings, butter and 
clarified dripinng are used sometimes in equal proportions. Fnmi 
three to four ounces of each will be sufficient for the pound and 
quarter of flour.

SAVOURY PUDDINGS 

The perfect maimer in which the nutriment and flavour of an 
infinite variety of viands may be preserved by enclosing and boiling 
them in paste, is a great recommendation of tms purely English class 
of dishes, the advantages of which foreign cooks are beginning to 
acknowl^ge. K really well made, these savoury puddings are 
worthy of a place on any table ; though the decrees of fashion — 
which in many instances have so much more influence with us than 
they deserve — have hitherto confined them almost entirely to the 
simple family dinners of the middle classes ; but we are bound to 
acknowledge that even where they are most commonly served they 
are seldom prepared with a creditable degree of skill ; and they are 
equally unmviting and unwholesome wnen heavily and coarsely 
concocted. From the general suggestions which we make here, and 
the few detailed receipts which follow, a clever cook will easily com- 
pound them to suit the taste and means of her employers ; for they 
may be either verv rich and expensive, or quite the reverse. Yemson 
{the neck is best ior the purpose), iatermingled or not with truffles ; 
sweetbreads sliced, and ovsters or nicely prepared button-mushrooms 
in alternate layers, with good veal stock for gravy;* pheasants, 
partridges, moorfowl, woodcocks, snipes, plovers, wheatears, may all 
be converted into the first class of these ; and veal kidneys, season^ 
with fine herbs, will supply another variety of them. Many persons 
like eels dressed in this way, but they are unsuited to delicate eaters ; 
and sausages are liable to the same objection ; and so is a harslet 
pudding, which is held in much esteem in certain counties, and 
which IS made of the heart, liver, kidneys, &c., of a pig. We can 
recommend as both wholesome and economical the receipts which 
follow, for the more simple kind of savoury puddings, and which 
may serve as guides for such others as the intelligence of the cook 
niaj suggest. 

BEEF-STEAK^ OR JOHN BULL's PUDDINO 

All meat puddings are more conveniently made in deep pans, 
moulds, or basins having a thick rim, below which the cloths can be 
tied without the hazard of their slipping off; and as the puddings 
should by no means be turried out biefore they are sent to table, one 
to match the dinner-service, at least in coloitr, is desirablcf Koll 

* The liquor of the oysters shonld be added when they are used. 

•f It is now customary in some families to hare both meat and fhiit puddings 
boiled and serred in pie or tart-dishes. They are lined entirely with very thui 
emst, or merely edged with it, according to taste ; then filled, closed, and cooked 
In the usual manner. The plan is a good and convenient one, where the light 
upper'Crust is preferred to the hea^y and sodden part which is under the meat. 
In Kent and Sussex, shallow pans, m form somewhat resembling a loi^e deep

out, and well floured; tie it over the pudding, gather Uie ooinen 
together, tie them over the top of the pudding, put it into plenty of 
fast boiling water, and let it remain in from three to five hours, 
according to its size. The instant it is lifted out, stick a fork quite 
through the middle of the paste to prevent its bursting ; remove the 
cloth quickly, and cut a smaQ round or square in the top to allow the 
steam to escape, and serve the pudding immediately. Though not 
considered very admissible to an el^antly- served table, this is a 
favourite dish with man^ persons, and is often in great esteem with 
sportsmen, for whom it is provided in preference to fare which re- 

Suires greater exactness in the ^i^e of cooking ; as an additional 
our*s boiling, or even more, will have little effect on a large puddiiu; 
of this kind, beyond reducing the quantity of gravy, and rendering it 
very thick. 

Some cooks flour the meat slightly before it is laid into the crust, 
out we do not think it an improvement : where fat is liked, a portion 
mav be added with the lean, but all skin and sinew should be care- 
fully rejected. Beat the steak with a paste roller, or cutlet-bat, 
should it not appear to be perfectly tender, and divide it into portions 
about the widtn of two fingers. Two or three dozens of oysters, 
bearded and washed free from grit in their own liquor (which should 
afterwards be strained and poured into the puddmg), may be inter- 
mingled with the meat. 

A true epicurean receipt for this dish directs the paste to be made 
with oea/-kidney suet, ana filled with alternate layers of the inside of 
the sirloiHf sliced and seasoned, and of fine plump native oysters, 
intermixed with an occasional sxnall slice of the veal fat. 

SMALL BEEF-STEAK PUDDING. 

Make into a veiy firm smooth paste, one pound of flour, six ounces 
of beef-suet finely minced, half a teaspoonful of salt, and half a piat 
of cold water. Line with this a basin which holds a pint and a half. 
Season a pound of tender steak, free from bone and skin, with half 
an ounce of salt and half a teaspoonful of pepper well mixed together ; 
lay it in the crust, pour in a quarter of a pint of water, roll out the 
cover, close the pudding carefully, tie a floured cloth over, and boil it 
for three hours and a naif. We give this receipt in addition to the 
preceding one, as an exact guide for the proportions of meat-puddings

RUTH pinch's BKEF-STEAK PUDDING. 

To make Rvth Pinches celebrated pudding (known also as beef- 
steak padding d ia Dickens)^ substitute six ounces of butter for the 
suet in this receipt, and moisten the paste with the well-beaten yolks 
of four eggs, or with three whole ones, mixed with a little water ; 
butter the basin very thickly before the paste is laid in, as the 
pudding is to be turned out of it for table. In all else proceed 
exactly as aboye. 

MUTTON PUDDING. 

Mutton freed pierfectly from fat, and mixed with two or three 
sliced Iddneys, makes an excellent j^udding. The meat may be 
sprinkled with fine herbs as it is laid into the crust This will 
require rather less boiling than the preceding puddings, but it ia 
made in precisely the same way. 

PARTRIDGE PUDDING. 

(Very Good.) 

Skin a brace of well-kept partridges and cut them down into 
joints; line a deep basin with suet crust, observing the directions 
given in the preceding receipts ; lay in the birds, which should be 
rather highly seasoned with pepper or cayenne, and moderately with 
salt ; pour in water for the gravy, close the pudding with care, and 
boil it from three hours to three and a half. The true flavour of the 
game is admirably preserved by this mode of cookine. When mush- 
rooms are plentiful, put a layer of buttons, or small flaps, cleaned as 
lor pickling, alternately with a layer of partridge, m filling the 

Iradoing, wmch will then be most excellent eating : the crust may be 
eft untouched, and merely emptied of its contents, where it is 
objected to, or its place may be supplied with a richer one made of 
butter. A seasoning of pounded mace or nutmeg can be used at 
discretion. Puddings of veal, chickens, and young rabbits, may all 
be made by this receipt, or with the addition of oysters, which we 
have already noticed. 

A PEAS PUDDING. 

(7b serve with bailed park,) 

Separate carefully from a pint of good mellow split peas, all that 
are worm-eaten ; wash the remainder well, and soak them for a nieht 
in plenty of soft water. The following day tie them up in a thick 
pudding cloth, giving them room to swell, cover them well with cold 
soft water and boil them gently from two hours to two and a hidf : 
if they are not then quite tender, they are of bad quality, and cannot

402 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. zx. 

be rendered so. Lift them into a cullender, untie the cloth, and 
crush them to a paste ^th a wooden spoon, stir in a good slice of 
butter, and a seasoning of pepper and SEtlt, tie them up again yery 
tight, and boil them for half an hour ; turn the pudding S^^^JZ ^^ 
a dish that it may not break, and serve it as hot as possible. This is 
the common old-fashioned mode of preparing a peas pudding, and 
many persons prefer it to the more modem one which fdlows. 
Soak, and boil the peas as above, drain the water well from them 
before the cloth is untied, rub them through a cullender or sieve, 
mix the seasoninfir and the butter thoroughly with them, then add to 
them gradually three well whisked eggs, tie the mixture tightly and 
closely in a floured cloth, and boil it for one hour. 

Grood split peas, 1 pint; soaked in soft water 1 night. Boiled 2 to 
2[ hours. Butter, 1 oz. : salt, pepper : boil again 20 to 30 minutes. 
Or : butter, H oz. ; eggs, 3 : boiled 1 hour. 

Obs. — ^When soil vrater cannot be had, half a teaspoonful of car- 
bonate of soda must be stirred into that in which the peas are boiled. 
They must have room to swell or they will be hard ; but if too much 
be given them they will be watery, and it will be difficult to convert 
them into a pudding at all. 

WINE SAFCB FOR SWEET PUDDINGS. 

Boil gently together for ten or fifteen minutes the very thin rind 
of half a small lemon, about an ounce and a half of sugar, and a 
wineglassful of water. Take out the lemon-peel and stir into the 
sauce until it has boiled for one minute, an ounce of butter smoothly 
mixed with a large half-teaspoon^ of flour ; add a win^lassful and 
a half of sherry or Madeira, or other good white wine, and when 
ouite hot serve the sauce without delay. Port wine sauce is made in 
the same way with the addition of a dessertspoon^ of lemon-juioe, 
some grated nutmqg and a little more sugar. Orange-rind and juioe 
may be used for it instead of lemon. 

CX>MMON WINE SAUCE. 

Sweeten a quarter-pint of good melted butter with an ounce and 
a half of sugar, and add to it gradually a couple of glasses of wine ; 
stir it until it is at the point of boiling, and serve it immediately. 
Lemon-grate, or nutmeg, can be added at pleasure. 

PUNCH SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS. 

This may be served with custard, plain bread, and plum-puddings 
With two ounces of sugar and a quarter of a pint of water, boil rery 
gently the rind of half a small lemon, and somewhat less of orange- 
peel, from fifteen to twenty minutes ; strain out the rinds, thicken 
the sauce with an ounce and a half of butter and nearly a teaspoonful 
of flour, add a half-glass of brandy, the same of white wise, two-^

less of lemon-juice : serve the sauce yery hot, but do not allow it to 
boil after the spirit is stirred in. 

Sugar, 2 oz.; water, i pint; lemon and orange rind: 14 to 20 
minutes. Butter, 1^ oz.; flour, 1 teaspoonful; brandy and white 
wine, each } wineglassful ; rum, two-thirds of glassM ; orange and

FOR CLEAR ARROW-ROOT SAUCE, 

(See the Welcome Oueses Own Pudding,) 

A GERMAN CUSTARD PUDDING-SAUCB. 

BoQ very gently together half a pint of new milk or of milk and 
cream mixed, a very thin strip or two of fresh lemon-rind, a bit of 
cinnamon, half an inch of a yanilla bean, and an ounce and a half or 
two ounces of sugar, until the milk is strongly flavoured ; then strain, 
and pour it, by slow decrees, to the well- b^ten yolks of three eggs, 
smoothly mixed with a knife-end-fuU (about half a teaspoonful) of 
flour, a grain or two of salt, and a tablespoonful of cold milk ; and 
stir these very quickly round as the milk is added. Put the sauce 
again into the stewpau, and whisk or stir it rapidly until it thickens, 
and looks creamy. It must not be placed upon the fire, but should 
be held over it, when this ia done. The Germans mill their sauces to 
a froth ; but they may be whisked with almost equally good eflect, 
though a small null for the purpose— formed like a chocolate mill- 
may be had at a very trifling cost 

A DELICIOUS GERMAN PUDDING-SAUCE. 

Dissolve in half a pint of sherry or of Madeira, from three to four 
ounces of fine sugar, but do not idlow the ¥dne to boil ; stir it hot to 
the well-beaten yolks of six fresh eggs, and mill the sauce over a 
gentle fire untQ it is well thickened and highly frothed ; pour it over 
a plum, or any other kind of sweet boiled pudding, of wluch it much 
improves the appearance. Half the quantity will oe sufficient for one 
of moderate size. We recommend the addition of a dessertspoonful 
of strained lemon-juice to the wine. 

Por large pudmng, sherry or Madeira, ) pint ; fine sugar, 3 to 4 
oz. ; yolks of eggs, 6 ; lemon-juice (if added), 1 dessertspoonful. 

Obs. — A3 we nave already said in the previous receipt, it is cus- 
tomary to froth sweet sauces in Grermany with a small machine 
made like a chocolate-mill. Two silver forks fastened together at the 
handles may be used instead on an emergency, or the sauce may be 
whisked to the proper state, like the one which precedes it. 

Great care must be taken not to allow these sauces to curdle. The 
safer plan is to put any preparation of the kind into a white jar, and 
to place it over the fire m a pan of boiling water, and then to stir or 
miU it until it is sufficiently tiiiickened : the jar should not be half 



404 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. XX 

filled, and it should be large enongli to allow the sauce to be worked 
easily. The water should not reach to within two or three inches of 
the brim. We give these minute details for inexperienced cooks. 

RED CURRANT OR RASPBERRY SAUCE. (OOOD.) 

Measure half a pint of sound red currants after they have been 
stripped from the stalks ; wash them, should they be dusty, and drain 
all the water from them. Have ready a syrup, made with three 
ounces of sugar in lumps, and the third of a pint of water, boiled 
gently together for five minutes ; put in the currants, and stew them 
for ten minutes ; strain off the juice, of which there will be nearly or 
quite half a pint, through a lawn sieve or folded muslin ; heat it 
afiresh, and pour it boiling to a small spoonftd of arrow-root whidi 
has been very smoothly mixed with a tablespoonM of cold water, 
being careful to stir it briskly while the juice is being added ; give 
the sauce a minute's boil to render it transparent, and nuuk the pud- 
ding with it (or, in other words, pour it equally over it, so as to 
cover the entire surface) ; or serve it in a tureen. A few raspberries 
may be added in their season, to flavour this preparation ; but if quite 
ripe, they must be thrown into the syrup without having been 
washed, two or three minutes after the currants have been put into 
it. A delicious sauce may be made entirely from raspberries as 
above, allowing a larger prpportion of the frmt, as it yields less juice 
than the currant. 

The proportions directed in this receipt are quite sufficient for a 
puddinff of moderate sixe, but they can easily be increased when 
required. 

COMMON RASPBERRY-SAUCE. 

Put three ounces of sugar broken into small lumps, and a wine- 
fflassful and a half of water into a small stewpan, and boil them for 
four or five minutes. Add half a pint of fresh ripe raspberries, well 
mashed with the back of a spoon. Mix them with the syrup, and 
boil them for six or seven mmutes ; the sauce should then be quite 
smooth and clear. The quantity of it with these proportions will not 
be large, but can be incr^ised at pleasure. 

Ohs. — ^We have generally found that the most simple, and con- 
sequently the most refreshing fruit-sauces have been much liked by 
the persons who have partaken of them; and they are, we think, 
preferable to the foreign ones— German principally — ^to which wine 
and cinnamon are commonly added, and wnich are oflen composed of 
dried fruit Their number can easily be augmented by an intelligent 
cook ; and thcTcan be varied through all the summer and autumnal 
months with the fhdt in season at the time. 

SUPERIOR FRUIT-SAUCES FOR BWEBT PUDDIKG8. 

Clear rich fhdt syrups, such as the Strop de OromUet of Chapter 
XXIX., or those from which cherries, apricots, damsons, and 



CHAP, zx.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 405 

other plums, are taken when they have been prepared in them for 
drying, make the finest possible sauces for sweet puddings. A pound 
of ripe Morella cherries, for example, pricked separately with a 
large needle, then slowly heated ana simmered from seven to ten 
minutes with three quarters of a pound of castor-suffar, and allowed 
to become cold in their juice, will be excellent if laid on dishes and 
slowly dried ; and the syrup from them will be a delicious accom- 
paniment to a pudding (or to plain boiled rice); and it will also 
afford a most agreeable summer beyerage mixed with water, slightly 
iced, or not. Other yarieties of these sauces are made by stewing the 
fruit tender without sugar, then rubbing it through a sieve, and 
diluting it with wine ; or simnly mixing and boiling it with sufficient 
sugar to render it sweet and clear. 

PINE-APPLE PUDDING-SAUCE. 

Basp down on a fine bright grater sufficient of the flesh of a ripe 
Jamaica or English pine-apple from which the rind has been thickly 
pared, to make the quantity of sauce required. Simmer it quite 
tender, with a very small quantity of water; then mix with it by 
degrees from half to three-quarters of its weight of sugar, give it five 
minutes more of gentle boiling, and pour it over the pudding. 

Basped pine<-apple, 6 oz. ; water, 2 tablespoonsful : 10 to 15 
minutes gentle stewing. Sugar, 4 oz. : 5 minutes. 

A finer sauce may be made with half a pound of the pine first 
simmered tender in its own juice, and one tablespoonful only of 
water, and then mixed with seven ounces of sifted sugar, and boiled 
sently until it looks clear. If fbo sweet, the strained juice of half a 
Lurge sized lemon may be stirred to it before it is served, but a cer- 
tain weight of sugar is required to make it appear bright. This pre- 
paration may be xept for some time, and warmed loresh for table 
when needed. 

A VEEY PINE PINE-APPLE SAUCE OR SYRUP, FOR PUDDINGS OR 
OTHER SWEET DISHES. 

After having pared away every morsel of the rind from a ripe and 
highly flavoured pine-apple, cut three-quarters of a pound of it into 
Tery thin slices, and then into quite small dice, rour to it nearly 
half a pint of spring water ; heat, and boil it verjr gently until it is 
extremely tender, then strain and press the iuice closely from it 
through a doth or through a muslin strainer'* folded in four ; strain 

• It is almost raperfluons to say that the large squares of xnaslin, of which on 
Acoonnt of their peculiar nicety we have recommended the use for straining 
many sweet preparations, must neTer have a particle of starch in them ; they 
■homd be carefmly kept free from dust and soil of any kind, and always weU 
linsed and soaked in elear water before they are dried. 



406 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. zx. 

it clear, mix it with ten ounces of the finest sugar in small lumps, 
and when this is dissolved, boil the syrup gently for a quarter of an 
hour. It will be delicious in flavour and very bright in colour if 
well made. If put into a jar, and stored with a paper tied over it, it 
will remain excellent for weeks ; and it will become almost a jelly 
with an additional ounce of sugar and rather quicker boiling. It mav 
be poured round moulded creams, rice, or sago ; or mingled witn 
vanous sweet preparations for which the juice of fruit is admissible. 

QEBMAN CHERRY SAUCE. 

Beat a quart of cherries in a mortar until the stones are broken, 
then boil them tender with half a pint of water and wine mixed. 
Bub them through a sieve, and boil them again, with from four to 
six ounces of fine sugar, some grated lemon-peel, powdered cinnamon, 
and a small portion of pounded cloves. In a few minutes stir to the 
sauce a dessertspoonful of potato-flour, smoothlj mixed with a very 
little cold water ; continue to stir until it is agam ready to boil, and 
serve it, either poured entirely over the pudding, or in a tureen. 

COMMON BATTER PUDDING. 

Beat four eggs thoroughly, mix with them half a pint of milk, and 
pass them through a sieve, add them by degrees to half a pound of 
flour, and when the batter is perfectly smooth, thin it with another 
half pint of milk. Shake out a wet pudding cloth, flour it well, 
pour the batter in, leave it room to swell, tie it securely, and put it 
mimediatelv into plenty of fast-boiliuff water. An hour and ten 
minutes will boil it. Send it to table tne instant it is dished, with 
wine sauce, a hot compdte of fruit, or raspberry vinegar : thia last 
makes a delicious puddmg sauce. Unless the liquid be added very 
gradually to the flour, and the mixture be well stirred and beaten 
as each portion is poured to it, the batter will not be smooth: to 
render it very light, a portion of the whites of the eggs, or the whole 
of them, should DC whisked to a froth and stirred mto it just before 
it is put into the cloth. 

Flour, i lb.; eggs, 4; salt, f teaspoonful; milk, 1 pint: 1 hour 
and 10 minutes. 

Obs. — Modern taste is in favour of puddings boiled in moulds, but, 
as we have already stated, they are seldom or ever so light as those 
which are tied in doths only. 

ANOTHER BATTER PUDDING. 

Mix the volks of three eegs smoothly with three heaped table- 
spoonsful of flour, thin the hatter with new milk until it is of the 
consistence of cream, whisk the whites of eggs apart, stir them into 
the batter, and boil the puddii^ in a flourea doui or in a battered 



CHAT. ZZ.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 407 

mould or basin for an hour. Before it is served, eat the top quickly 
into large dice half through the pudding, pour oyer it a small jarful 
of fine currant, raspberry, or strawberry jelly, and send it to table 
"without the slightest delay. 

Flour, 3 tablespoonsful ; eggs, 3 ; salt, ) teaspoonful ; milk, from 
} to whole pint : 1 hour. 

BLACK-CAP PUDDING. 

Make a good light thin batter, and just before it is poured into the 
•doth stir to it half a pound of currants, well cleaned and dried: 
these will sink to the lower ]^art of the pudding and blacken the 
surface. Boil it the usual tune, and dish it with the dark side 
uppermost; send very sweet 'sauce to table with it. Some cooks 
butter a mould thickly, strew in the currants, and pour the batter on 
them, which produces the same appearance as when the ingredients 
are tied in a cloth. 

AU batter puddings should be despatched quickly to table when 
they are once ready to serye, as tney speedily become heavy if 
^owed to wait 

BATTER FRUIT PUDDING. 

Butter thickly a basin which holds a pint and a hal^ and fill it 
nearly to the brim with good boiling apples pared, cored, and quar- 
tered; pour over them a batter made with four tablespoonsful of 
£our, two large or three small eggs, and half a pint of znilk. Tie a 
buttered and floured cloth over the basin, which ought to be quite 
full, and boil the pudding for an hour and a quarter. Turn it into 
a hot dish when done, and strew sugar thickly oyer it : this, if added 
to the batter at first, renders it heavy. Morella cherries make a 
very superior pudding of this kind ; and green gooseberries, damsons, 
.and vanous other frmts, answer for it extremely well : ^e time of 
boiling it must be varied according to their quality and its size. 

For a pint and a half mould or basin filled to the brim with apples 
•or other fruit; flour, 4 tablespoonsful; eggs, 2 large or 3 small; 
milk, } pint : li hour. 

Obs. — Apples cored, halved, and mixed with a good batter, make 
an excellent baked pudding, as do red currants, cherries, and plums 
of different sorts likewise.

pepper ; mix these into a smooth paste with one well-beaten ^g, and 
a little cold milk or water ; make it into the shape of a paste^roller, 
fold a floured cloth round it, tie the ends tightly, and boil it for two 
hours. In Kentish farm-houses, and at very plain family dinners, 
this pudding is usually sent to table with TOiled beef, and b some- 
times cook^ with it also. It is very good sliced and broiled, or 
browned in a Dutch oven, after having Income quite cold. 

Flour, 11 lb. ; suet, ) lb. ; salt { teaspoonful ; half as much pepper; 
1 egg; little milk or water : boiled 2 hours. 

▲lYOTnER SUET PUDDING. 

Make into a somewhat lithe but smooth paste, half a pound of 
fine stale bread-crumbs, three quarters of a pound of flour, from ten 
to twelve ounces of beef-suet cnopped extremely small, a large half- 
teaspoonful of salt, and rather less of pepper, with two ^gs and a 
little milk. Boil it for two hour^ and a quarter. 

APPLE^ CUKBJCrr, CHERRY^ OR OTHER FRESH FRUIT PUDDIKG. 

Make a i>aste as for a beef-steak pudding, either with suet or 
butter ; lay into a basin a well-floured cloth, which has been dipped 
into hot water, wrung di^, and shaken out; roll the paste thin, 
press it evenly into the basm upon the cloth, fill it with apples, pared, 
cored, and quartered, or with any other fiiiit; put on the cover, 
taking care to moisten the edges of the paste, to press them well 
I together, and fold them over; rather u]^ tne ends of the doth, and 
tie it firmly close to the pudding, which should then be dropped 
into plenty of fast boiling water. When it is done, lift it out by 
twistmg a strong fork into the comer of the cloth, turn it gently 
into the dish in which it is to be served, and cut immediately a smaU 
round or square from the top, or the pudding will quickly beccmie 
heavy; send it to table without the slightest delay, accompankdby 
pounded, and by good Lisbon sugar, as many persons prefer the 
latter, from its imparting a more mellowed flavour to the fruit A 
smfdl slice of fresh butter, and some finely srated nutmeg, are usually 
considered improvements to an apple pudding; the juice, and the 
grated rind or a lemon may be added with ptod effect, when the 
fruit ia laid into the crust, especially in spnng, when the apples 
generally will have become insipid in their flavour. For tables of 
any pretension, sugar must be added to them when they are made ; 
but many vatieties of apple do not so readily form a smooth light 
pulp when it is enclosed with them in the paste. A small jar of 
apncot jam is always an admirable addition to an apple tait or 
pudding; and a small glass of wine when the fruit is not juicy, will 
assist to bring it to the right consistence. When puddings are 
preferred boiL^ in moulds or basing these must be thickly buttered 



CHAP. XX.] BOILED PUDDINGS, 409 

before the paste is laid into them, and the puddings most be turned 
from them gently, that they may not burst. 

Currant, gooseberry, or cherry pudding, 1 to 1} hour. Green- 
sage, damson, mussel, or other ]^lum, 1 to 1} hour. Apple pudding, 
from 1 to 2 hours, according to its size, and the time of year.

much boUine as may be needed for the crust. These are sometimes 
mixed Tnth Morella cherries rolled in plenty of sugar, and the two 
fruits mixed are excellent, but the Morellas by themselves are 
better 



A COMMON APPLE PUDDING. 

Idake a light crust with one pound of flour, and six ounces of 
very finely minced beef-suet ; roll it thin, and fill it with one pound 
and a quarter of good boiling apples; add the grated rind and 
strained juice of a small lemon, tie it in a doth, and boil it one hour 
and twenty minutes before Christmas, and from twenty to thirty 
minutes longer after Christmas. A smidl slice of fresh butter, 
stirred into it when it is sweetened will, to many tastes, be an 
acceptable addition; grated nutmeg, or a little cinnamon in fine 
powder, may be substituted for the lemon-rind when either is 
preferred. To conrert this into a richer pudding use half a pound 
of butter for the crust, and add to the apples a spoonful or two of 
orange or quince marmalade. 

Crust : flour, 1 lb. ; suet, 6 oz. Fruit, pared and cored, 1} lb. ; 
juice and rind of 1 small lemon (or some nutmeg or cinnamon in 
powder). 

Richer pudding : flour, 1 lb. ; butter ) lb. ; in addition to firuit, 
1 or 2 tablespooiuBful of orange or auince zaarmalade. 

Herodotus' pudding. 
(A Oevmne Classical Receipt,) 

^ Prepare and mix in the usual manner one pound of fine raisins 
stoned, one pound of minced beef-suet, half a pound of bread-crumbs, 
four figs chopped small, two tablespoonsful of moist sugar (honey, 
in the original), two wine^lassesful of sherry, and the rind of half 
a large lemon (grated]). Boil the pudding for fourteen hours!* 

Obs, — This receipt is really to be found in Herodotus. The only 
variations made in it are the substitution of sugar for honey, and 
sherry for the wine of ancient Greece. We are indebted for it to 
an accomplished scholar, who has had it served at his own table on 
more than one occasion; and we have given it on his authority, 
without testing it : but we venture to suggest that seven hours would 
boil it quite sufficiently.

This pudding can scarcely be made too rich. First blanch, and 
then beat to the smoothest possible paste, six ounces of fresh Jcurdr j 
almonds, and a dozen bitter ones ; pour very gradually to them, in 
the mortar, three quarters of a pmt of boilmg cream ; then tun 
them into a cloth, and wring it from them again with strong 
expression. Heat a full half pint of it afresh, and pour it, as soon 
as It boils, upon four ounces of fine bread-crumbs, set a plate over, 
and leave them to become nearly cold ; then mix thoroughly with 
them four ounces of maccaroons, crushed tolerably small; five 
of finely minced beef-suet, five of marrow, cleared very carefully 
from fibre, and from the splinters of bone which are sometimes found 
in it, and shred not very small, two ounces of flour, six of pounded 
gu^, four of dried cherries, four of the best Muscatel raisins, 
weighed after they are stoned, half a pound of candied citron, or of 
citron and orange rind mixed, a quarter saltspoonful of salt, half a 
nutmeg, the yolks only of seven full-sized ^;gs, the grat^ rind of a 
large lemon, and last of all, a glass of the best Cognac brandy, which 
must be stirred briskly in by slow desrees. Four the mixture into 
a thickly buttered mould or basin, which contains a full quart, fill it 
to the brim, lay a sheet of buttered writing-paper over, then a well- 
floured cloth, tie them securely, and boil tne pudding for foTir hours 
and a quarter ; let it stand for two minutes before it is turned out ;

Obs, — This pudding, which, if well made, is very light as well as 
rich, will be sufficiently good for most tastes without the almonds : 
when they are omitted, the boiling cream must be poured at once to

buttered mould or basin that will just hold it. Let it stand for five 
minutes at least before it is turned out ; dish it carefully, strew, and 
£;amish it thickly with branches of preserved barberries, or send it 
to table with a rich syrup of fresh fruit, or with clear fruit-jelly, 
melted. We have had often a compote (see Sweet Dishes) of cur- 
rants, cherries, or plums served, and greatly relished with this pud- 
ding, which we can rcconmiend to our readers as an extremely deli- 
cate one. The flavouring may be varied with bitter almonds, lemon- 
lind, noyau, or aught else which may be better liked than the 
yanilla. 

New milk, 1 pint ; vanilla, \ pod : 20 minutes. Cream, \ pint ; 
sugar, 8 oz. ; yolks of egffs, 8 : 1 hour. 

Obs, — The cook must be reminded that unless the eggs be stirred 
briskly as the boiling milk is graduallv poured to them, they will be 
likely to curdle. A buttered paper should always be put over the 
baan before the doth is tied on, for all custard puddings. 



COMMON CUSTARD PUDDINQ. 

Whisk three e^gs well, j>ut them into a nint basin, and add to 
them sufficient nulk to fill it : then strain, flavour, and sweeten it 
with fine sugar ; boil the pudding very softly for an exact half hour, 
let it stand a few minutes, dish, and serve it with sugar sifted over, 
and sweet sauce in a tureen, or send stewed gooseberries, currants, or 
cherries to table with it. A small quantity of lemon-brandy, or of 
ratifia can be added, to give it flavour, when it is made, or the sugar 
vrith which it is sweetened may be rasped on a lemon or an orange, 
then crushed and dissolved in the milk ; from an ounce and a halfto 
two ounces will be sufficient for general taste. 

PRINCE Albert's pudding. 

Beat to a cream half a pound of fresh butter and mix with it by 
degrees an equal weight of pounded loaf-sugar, dried and sifted ; add 
to these, after they have been well beaten together, first the yolks, 
and then the whites of five fresh e^gs, which have been thoroughly 
whisked apart ; now strew lightly m, half a pound of the finest £u>ur, 
dried and sifted, and last of all, half a pound of jar raisins, weighed 
after they are stoned. Put these ingredients, penectly mixed, into a 
well-buttered mould, or floured clotn, and boil the pudding for three 
hours. Serve it with punch sauce. We recommend a littk pounded 
maoe, or the grated rind of a small lemon, to vary the flavour of this 
excellent pudding ; and that when a mould is used, slices of candied 
peel should be laid rather thickly over it after it is buttered.

ounces of hieef-suet finely chopped, two ounces and a half of sugar, 
an ounce of candied orange or lemon-rind, six ounces of sultana 
raisins, and three large egf^ well beaten, and strained. Boil the 
pudding in a buttered basm, or in a well-floured doth, for two 
hours uid a quarter, and serve it with the following sauce :— Dissolve 
an ounce and a half of sugar broken small in two glasses of sheny, 
or of any other white wine, and stir them when <|uite hot, to the 
beaten yolks of three fresh ^;g8 ; then stir the sauce m a small sauce- 
pan held high above the fire until it resembles custard, but by no 
means allow it to boil, or it will instantly curdle ; pour it over the 
radding, or, if preferred, send it to table in a tureen. We think a 
uU teupoonful of lemon-iuice added to the wine an improvement 
to this sauce which is excellent ; and we can recommend the pudding 
to our readers.

two before it is dished, and serve it with simple wine sauce, or with 
that which follows; or with pine-apple or any other clear fruit- 
sauce. (For these last, see page 405). 

Boil Teiy gently, for about ten minutes, a full quarter of a pint of 
water, with the very thin rind of half a fresh lemon, and an ounce 
and a half of lump sugar ; then take out the lemon peel, and stir in 
a small teaspoonful of arrowroot, smoothly mixed with the strained 
juice of the lemon (with or without the addition of a little orange 
juice) ; take the sauce from the fire, throw in nearly half a glass of 
pale French brandy,* or substitute for this a large wineglassful of 
sherry, or of any other white wine which may be preferred, but 
increase a little, in that case, the proportion of arrowroot. 

To conyert the precedii^ into Sir Edwin Landseer^s puddingy

A CABINET PUDDING. 

Split and stone three dozens of fine jar raisins, or take an equal 
number of dried cherries, and place either of them r^ularly in a sort 
of pattern, in a thickly -buttered plain quart mould or basin ; next, 
slice and lay into it three penny sponge-cakes; add to these two 
ounces of ratifias, four macaroons, an ounce and a half of candied 
citron sliced thin, the yolks of four eggs with the whites of three 
only, thoroughly whisked, mixed with half a pint of new milk, then 
strained to half a pint of sweet cream, and sweetened with two ounces 
and a half of pounded suear : these ought to fill the mould exactly. 
Steam the pudding, or bou it very gently for one hour ; let it stand 
ti fbw minutes before it is dished, tnat it may not break ; and serve it 
with good wine or brandy sauce.

Obs. — We have given this receipt, for which we are indebted to a 
iriend, without any variation from the original, because on testing it 
we have found it very exact with regard to quantity and time ; but 
though an extremely delicate and excellent pudding, a little flavour- 
ing would, we think, improve it : a small portion of the milk may be 
omitted, aiid its place supplied by ratifia, lemon-brandy, or aught

A YERY FINE CABINET PODDING. 

Butter thickly a mould of the same size as for the preoedSng 
pudding, and ornament it tastefully with dried cherries, or with the 
finest muscatel raisins opened and stoned; lay lightly into it a 
quarter-pound of sponge biscuit cut in slices, and intermixed with an 
equal weight of ratifias; sweeten with three ounces of sugar in 
lumps, and flayour highly with vanilla, or with the thin rind of hah 
a fine lemon, and six sound bitter almonds bruiaed (should these be 
preferred), tiiree-quarters of a pint, or rather more, of thin cream, 
or of cream and new milk mixed ; stndn and pour this hot to the 
well-beaten yolks of six eggs and the whites of two, and when the 
mixture is nearly cold, throw in gradually a wineglassful of good 
brandy ; pour it gently, and by degrees, into the mould, and steam 
or boil the puddmg very softly for an hour. Serve it with well 
made wine sauce. Never omit a buttered pa]^ over any sort ot 
custard-mixture ; and remember that quick Doilinff will destroy the 
good appearance of this kind of pudding. The liquid should be 
quite cold before it is added to the cakes, or the butter on the mould 
would melt ofi^, and the decorations with it ; preserved ginger, and 
candied citron in slices, may be used to vary these, and the syrup of 
the former may be added to give flavour to the other ingredients. 

Dried cherries, 3 to 4 oz. ; sponge-biscuits, i lb. ; ratifias, 4 oz. ; 
thin cream, or cream and milk, | pint ; sugar, 3 oz. ; vanilla, i pod 
(or thin rind of } lemon and 6 bitter almonds bruised) ; yolks of 6 
eggs, whites of 2; brandy, 1 wineglassful (preserved gmger and 
candied citron at choice) : steamed, or gently boiled, 1 hour. 



SNOWDON PUDDING. 

(^Oenuine Receipt) 

Ornament a well buttered mould or basin with some fine raisLns 
split open and stoned, but not divided, pressing the cut side on the 
butter to make them adhere; next, mix naif a pound of very finely 
minced beef-kidney suet, with half a pound of bread crumbs, and an 
ounce and a half of rice-flour, a pinch of salt, and six ounces of 
lemon marmalade, or of orange when the lemon cannot be nrocored; 
add six ounces of pale brown sugar, six thoroughly whisked egsa^ 
and the grated rinds of two lemons. Beat the whole until all the 
ingredients are perfectly mixed, pour it gently into the mould, cover 
it with a buttered paper and a floured cloth, and boil it for one hour 
and a half. It will turn out remarkably well if carefully prepared. 
Half the quantity given above will fill a mould or basin wnicn will 
contain rather more than a pint, and will be sufficiently boiled in ten 
minutes less than an hour. To many tastes a slight diminution in 
the proportion of suet would be an improvement to the padding; 



CHAP. XX.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 415 

and the sabstitation of pounded sugar for the brown, might likewise 
be considered so. Both the suet and egg^ used for it, should be as 
fiesh as possible. 

This pudding is constantly served to travellers at the hotel at the 
foot of the mountain from which it derives its name. It is probably 
well known to many of our readers in consequence. Wine sauce, 
arrowroot, German sauce, or any other of the sweet pudding sauces 
to be found in the precedmg pages of this chapter, may be poured 
over, or sent to table with it. 

YEBT GOOD RAISIN PUDDINGS. 

To three quarters of a pound of flour add four ounces of fine 
crumbs of bread, one pound of beef-suet, a pound and six ounces of 
raisins, weighed after they are stoned, a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
salt, rather more of ginger, half a nutmeg, an ounce and a half of 
candied peel, and four lar^ or five small eggs beaten, strained, and 
mixed with a cupful of milk, or as much more as will make the 
whole of the consistence of a very thick batter. Four the mixture 
into a well-floured doth of dose texture, which has previouslv been 
dipped into hot water, wrung, and shaken out. Boil the pudding in. 
plenty of water for four hours and a half. It may be served with 
verv sweet wine, or punch sauce ; but if made as we have directed, 
will be much lighter than if sugar be mixed with the other ingre- 
dients before it is boiled ; and we have found it generally preferred 
to a richerplum-pudding. 

No. 1. Flour, f lb.; bread-crumbs, 4oz.; beef-suet, 1 lb.; stoned 
raisins, 1 lb. 6 oz. ; candied peel, H oz. ; i nutmeg ; eggs, 4 large, or 
6 small ; little salt and ginger : 4^ hours.

Obs. — The remains of this pudding will answer well for the 
receipt which follows. Sultana raisins can be used for it instead of 
Malaga, but they are not so sweet. 

THE ELEGANT ECONOMIST'S PUDDING.

tasteful mode of serving the remains of a pltun-puiding than the 
usual one of broiling them in slices, or converting them into fritters. 
The German sauce, well milled or frothed, is generally much relished 
vrith sweet boiled puddings, and adds greatly to their good appear- 
ance ; but common wine or punch sauce, may be sent to table with 
the above quite as appropriately. * 

Mould or basin holding !( pint, lined with thin slices of plum-

Mix very thoroughly one pound of finely 'grated bread with the 
same Quantity of flour, two pounds of raisins stoned, two of currants, 
two or suet minced small, one of sugar, half a pound of candied peel, 
one nutmeg, half an ounce of mixed spice, and the grated linds of 
two lemons; mix the whole with sixteen ^gs well beaten and 
strained, and add four glasses of brandv. These proportions will 
make three puddings of good size, each of which should be boiled six 
hours. 

Bread-crumbs, 1 lb. ; flour, 1 lb. ; suet, 2 lbs. ; currants, 2 lbs. ;

TEGETABLB PLUM PUDDDfa. 
{Cheap and good,) 

Mix well together one pound of smoothly-mashed potatoes, half a 
pound of carrots boiled quite tender, and beaten to a paste, one 
pound of flour, one of currants, and one of raisins (full weight after 
they are stoned), three quarters of a pound of suear, eight ounces of 
suet, one nutmeg, and a quarter of a teaspoonfm of salt. Put the 
pudding into a well-floured cloth, tie it up very doselj^, and boil it 
for four hours. The correspondent to whom we are indebted for 
this receipt says, that the cost of the ingredients does not exceed half 
a crown, and that the pudding is of sumcient size for a ^arty of six- 
teen persons. We can vouch for its excellence, but as it is rather apt 
to break when turned out of the cloth, a couple of eggs would per- 
haps improve it. It is excellent cold. Sweetmeats, brandy, and 
spices can be added at pleasure. 

Mashed potatoes, 1 lb. ; carrots, 8 oz. ; flour, 1 lb. ; suet, \ lb. ;

To* three ounces of flour, and the same weight of fine, lightl]^- 
grated bread-crumbs, add six of beef kidney-suet, chopped small, six 
of raisins weighed after they are stoned, six of wdl-cleaned currants, 
fbur ounces of minced apples, five of sugar, two of candied orange- 
rind, half a teaspoonful of nutmeg mixed with pounded mace, a very 
little salt, a small glass of brandy, and three whole eg^. Mix and 
beat these ingredients well together, tie them tightly in a thickly- 
floured cloth, and boil them for three hours and a half. We can 
recommend this as a remarkably light small rich pudding : it may be 
served with German, wine, or punch sauce.

A KENTISH WELL PUDDING. 

Make into a firm smooth paste, with cold water, one pound of flour, 
six ounces of finely-minced beef-suet, three quarters of a pound of 
euirants, and a small pinch of salt, thoroughly mixed together 



418 MODERN COOKEEY. [CHIP. DL 

Form into a ball six ounces of ^oodbntter, and enclose it secnrdy 
in about a third of the paste (rolled to a half inch of thickness), in 
the same way that an appIe-dumpllng is made ; roll out the re- 
mainder of the paste, ana place the portion containing the batter in 
the centre of it, with the part where the edge was drawn together 
turned downwards : gather the outer crust round it, and after haviog 
moistened the edge, close it with ^eat care. Tie the puddin? 
tightly in a well-floured cloth, and boil it for two hours and a half, 
[t must be dished with caution that it may not break, and a small bit 
must be cut directly from the top, as in a meat pudding. (See page 
400}. 

This is a very farourite pudding in some parts of England ; the 
only difficulty in making or in serving it, is to preyent the escape of 
the butter, which, if properly secured, will be found in a liquid state 
in the inside, on opening it. Some timid cooks fold it in three 
coyerings of paste, the better to guard against its bursting through ; 
but there is no danger of this if the edges of the crust be well dosied. 
When suet is objected to, seven ounces of butter may be subatitated 
for it. The currants are occasionally omitted. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; suet, 6 oz. ; currants, $ lb. ; salt, small pinch ; ball of 
but 6 oz. : 2i hours. 

ROLLED PUDDING. 

Roll out thin a bit of light puff paste, or a good suet crust, and 
spread equally over it to within an inch of the edge, any kind of fruit 
jam. Orange marmalade, and mincemeat make excellent varieties of 
this pudding, and a deep layer of fine brown sugar, flavoured with 
the grated rind and strained juice of one very large, or of two small, 
lemons, answers for it extremely well. Roll it up carefiiUj, pinch 
the paste together at the ends, fold a doth round, secure it well at 
the ends, and boil the pudding from one to two hours, acoordii^ to 
its size and the nature of the ingredients. Half a pound of &ur 
made into a paste with suet or butter, and covered with preserve^ 
will be quite sufficiently boiled in an hour and a quarter. 

A BREAD PUDDma. 

Sweeten a pint of new milk with three ounces of fine sugar, 
throw in a few grains of salt, and pour it boiling on half a pound of 
fine and lightly-grated bread-cnmibs ; add an ounce of fresh butter, 
and cover them with a plate ; let them remain for half an hour or 
more, and then stir to them four large well-whisked eggs, and a 
flavouring of nutmee or of lemon-rind; pour the mixture into a 
thickly-buttered momd or basin, which holds a pint and a half^ and 
which ought to be quite full ; tie a paper and a doth tightly over, 
and boU the pudding for exactly an hour and ten minutes. This is 
quite a plain receipt but by omitting two ounces of the bread, and

adding more butter, one egg, a small glass of brandy, the grated rind 
of a lemon, and as much sugar as ^nll sweeten the whole richly, a 
Teiy excellent pudding will be obtained ; candied orange-peel also 
has a good effect when sliced thinly into it ; and half a pound of 
currants is generally considered a further improvement. 

New milk, 1 pint ; sugar, 3 oz. ; salt, few grains ; bread-crumbs, J^

dried, wilh half a saltspoonful of salt, three ounces of sugar, the 
third of a small nutmeg grated, two ounces of candied peel, five 
well-beaten eggs, and a ^ass of brandy. Mix these ingredients 
thoroughly, and boil the pudding in a cloth for three hours and a 
hfdf. Send port wine sauce to table with it. The grated rind of 
a large lemon may be added to this pudding with good effect.

A GOOD BOILED RICE PUDDING. 

Swell gradually,* and boil until quite soft and thick, four ounces 
and a half of whole rice in a pint and a half of new nulk ; sweeten 
them with from three to four ounces of sugar, broken small, and stir 
to them while th^ are still quite hot, the grated rind of half a large 
lemon, four or nye bitter almonds, pounded to a paste, and four 
large well-whisked eg^ ; let the mixture cool, and then pour it into 
a thickly-buttered bium, or mould, which should be (juite full ; tie a 
buttered paper and a floured cloth over it, and boil the puddinff 
exactly an hour ; let it stand for two or three minutes before it is 
tomed out, and serve it with sweet sauce, fruit syrup, or a compete 
of fresh fruit. An ounce and a half of candied orange-rind will 
improve it much, and a couple of ounces of butter may be added to 
enrich it, when the receipt mthout is considered too simple. It is 
exceUeni when made with milk highly flavoured with cocoa-nut, or 
with vanilla. 

Whole rice, 4) oz. ; new milk (or cocoa-nut-flavoured milk), \\

Kice, 6 oz. ; green gooseberries, I pint * 1| hour. 

FASHIONABLE APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

These are boiled in small knitted or cloeely-netted cloths (the 
former have, we think, the prettiest effect), which give quite an 
ornamental app^irance to an otherwise homely dish. Take out the 
cores without diyiding the apples, which should be large, and of a good 
boiling kind, and fill the cavities with orange or lemon marmalade; 
enclose them in a good crust rolled thin, draw the cloths round them, 
tie them closely, and boil them for three quarters of an hour. LemoD 
dumplinss may be boiled in the same way. 

i to 1 hour, if the apples be not of the best boiling kind. 

ORANGE SNOW-BALLS. 

Take out the unhusked grains, and wash well half a pound of lice; 
put it into plenty of water, asd boil it rather qmckly for ten 
minutes ; drain and let it cool. Pare four large, or five snudl 
oranges, and clear fVom them entirely the thick white inner skin; 
spre^ the rice, in as many equal portions as there are oranges, upon 
some pudding or dumpling cloths ; tie the fruit separately in these, 
and boil the snow-balls for an hour and a half; turn them carefoUy 
on to a dish, and strew plenty of sifted sugar oyer them. Hie 
oranffes careMly pared may be enclosed in a thin paste and boiled 
for the same time

APPLE SNOW-BALLS. 

Fare and core some large pudding-apples, without dividing them, 
prepare the rice as in the foregoing receipt, enclose them in it, and 
ix>il them for one hour : ten minutes less wiU be sufficient should the 
finoit be but of moderate size. An agreeable addition to them is a 
slice of fresh butter, mixed with as much sugar as can be smoothly 
blended with it, and a flayouring of powdered cinnamon, or of 
nutmeg : this must be sent to table apart from them, not in ^e dish. 

LIGHT CURRANT DUMPLINGS. 

For each dumpling take three tablespoonsful of flour, two of finely- 
nlnced suet, and three of currants, a slight pinch of salt, and as much 
milk or water as will make a very thick batter of the ingredients. 
Tie the dumplings in well-floured cloths, and boil them lor a full 
hour : thej may be served with very sweet wine sauce. 

LBUON DUMPLINGS. (lIGHT AND GOOD.) 

Mix, with ten ounces of fine bread-crumbs, half a pound of beef* 
suet, chopped extremely small, one large tablespoonAil of flour, the 
grated rinds of two small lemons, or of a very large one, four ounces 
of pounded susar, three large or four small eggs beaten and strained, 
and last of all, the juice of the lemons, or part of it, also strained. 
Divide these into four equal portions, tie them in well-floured cloths, 
and boil them an hour. The dumplings will be extremely light and 
delicate : if wished very sweet, more sugar must be added to them. 
The s^p of preserved ginger would be both a wholesome and ap- 
propriate sauce for them. 

SUFFOLK, OR HARD DUMPLINGS. 

Mix a little salt with some flour, and make it into a smooth and 
rather lithe paste, with cold water or skimmed milk; form it into 
dumplings, and throw them into boiling water : in half an hour they 
will be rcad^ to serve. A better kmd of dumpling is made by 
adding sufliaent milk to the flour to form a thick batter, and then 
tying the dumplings in small well-floured cloths. In Suffolk farm- 
houses, they are served vrith the dripping-pan gravy of roast meat ; 
and they are sometimes made very small indeed, and boiled with 
stewed shin of beef 

NORFOLK DUMPLINGS. 

Take a pound of dough from a baking of very light white bread, 
and divide it into six equal parts ; mould these into dumplings, drop 
them into a pan of fast bouing water, and boil them quiddy frcm 



422 MODERN COOKERT. [chap. xx. 

twelve to fifteen minntes. Send them to table the instant they are 
dished, with wine sauce or raspberry vinegar. In some counties they 
are eaten with melted butter, well sweetened, and mixed with a littk 
vinegar. They must never be cut, but should be torn apart with a 
couple of forks. 

SWEET BOILED PATTIES* (gOOD.) 

Mix into a very smooth paste, three ounces of finely-minced suet 
with eight of flour, and a light pinch of salt ; divide it into fourteen 
balls of equal size, roll them out quite thin and round, moisten the 
edges, put a little preserve into each, close the patties very securely 
to prevent its escape, throw them into a pan of boiling water, and in 
from ten to twelve minutes lift them out, and serve them instantly. 
Butter-crust may be used for them instead of suet but it will not be 
so light 

Flour, 8 oz. ; suet, 3 oz. ; Utde salt ; divided into fourteen portions : 
boiled 10 to 12 minutes. 

BOILED RICE TO BE SERVED WITH STEWED FRUITS, PRESERYES^ 
OR RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

Take out the discoloured grains from half a pound of good rice ; 
and wash it in several waters ; tie it very loosely in a pud£ng doth, 
put it into cold water ; heat it slowly, and boil it for quite an hour, 
It will then be quite solid and resemble a pudding m appearance. 
Sufficient room must be given to allow the grain to swell to its full 
size, or it will be hard ; but too much space will render the whole 
watery. With a little experience, the cook will easily ascertain the 
exact degree to be allowed for it. Four ounces of rice will require 
quite three quarters of an hour*s boiliii^ ; a little more or less of time 
will sometimes be needed, from the difference of quality in the grain. 
It should be put into an abundant quantity of water, which should 
be cold, and then very slowly heated.

CHAPTER XXI. 




Pudding garnished with Preseires. 
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

"Wb have little to add here to the re- 
marks which will be found at the com- 
mencement of the preceding Chapter, as 
they will apply equally to the preparation 
of these and of hoiled puddings 

All of the custard kind, whether made 
of eggs and milk only, or of sago, arrow- 
root, rice, ground or in grain, vermicelli, 
&c., require a very gentle oven, and are Baked Pudding Mould 
spoiled by fast-balung. Those made of batter on the contrary, 
should be put into one sufficiently brisk to raise them quickly but 
without scorching them. Such as contain suet and raisins must have 
a well-heated but not a fierce oven ; for as they must remain long in 
it to be thoroughly done, unless carefully managed they will either 
be mudi too highly coloured or too dry. 

By whisking to a solid froth the whites of the eggs used for any 
pudding, and stirring them softly into it at the instant of placing it 
m the oven it will be rendered exceedingly light, and will rise very 
high in the dish ; but as it will partake then of the nature of a 




424 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. xxi. 

ioufflit it must be despatched with great expedition to table from the 
oven, or it will become flat before it is served. 

When a pndding is sufficiently browned on the surface Tthat is to 
say, of a fine equal amber-colour) before it is baked through, a sheet 
of writing paper should be laid over it, but not before it is set: when 
quite firm m the centre it will be done. 

Potato, batter, plum, and every other kind of pudding indeed 
which is sufficiently solid to allow of it, should be turned on to a 
clean hot dish from the one in which it is baked, and strewed with 
sifted sugar before it is sent to table. 

Minute directions for the preparation and management of each 
particular variety of pudding will be found in the receipt for it. 

A BAKED PLUM PUDDINQ £N MOULE, OR MOULDED. 

Mngle thoroughly in a large pan or bowl half a pound of the 
nicest beef-kidney suet minced very small, half a pound of carefuUv 
stoned raisins, as many currants, four ounces of pounded sugar, hau 
a pound of flour, two ounces of candied citron and lemon or orange 
rind, four large well whisked eegs, a small cup of milk, a glass of 
brandy, a tiny pinch of salt, and some nutmeg or powdered ginger. 
Beat the whole up lightly, pour it into a well-buttered mould or 
cake-tin and bake it in a moderate oven from an hour and a half to 
two hours. Turn it from the mould and send it quickly to table 
with Devonshire cream^ or melted apricot marmalade for sauce. 

THE PRINTEfi's PUDDING. 

Grate rery lightly six ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf, and put 
it into a deep dish. Dissolve in a quart of cold new milk four 
ounces of good Idsbon sugar ; add it to five large, wdl-whisked cgga, 
strain, and mix them with the bread-crumbs ; stir in two ounces of a 
fresh finely-grated cocoa-nut; add a flavouring of nutmeg or of 
lemon-rina, and the slightest pinch of salt ; let the pudding stand for 
a couple of hours to sodc the bread ; and bake it in a gentle oven for 
three-quarters of an hour : it will be excellent if carefully made, and 
not too quickly baked. When the cocoa-nut is not at hand, an 
ounce of butter just dissolved, should be poured over the dish before 
the crumbs are put into it ; and the rind of an entire lemon may be 
used to give it flavour ; but the cocoa-nut imparts a peculiar riclinesi 
when it is good and fresh. 

Bread-crumbs, 6 oz. ; new milk, 1 quavt ; sugar, 4 oz. ; eggs, 5 ; 
cocoa-nut, 2 oz. (or rind, 1 large lemon, and 1 oz. butter) ; sBghtest 
pinch of salt : to stand 2 hours. Baked in gentle oven full f hour. 

06«.— When a very sweet pudding is liked, the proportioii of 
sugar may be increased.

ALMOND PUDDING. 

On two ounces of fine bread-cmmbs pour a pint of boiling cream, 
and let them remain until nearly cold, then mix them very gradually 
with half a pound of sweet and six bitter almonds pounded to the 
smoothest paste, with a little orange-flower water, or with a few drops 
of sprins water, just to prevent uieir oiling ; stir to them by degrees 
the well-beaten yolks of seven and the whites of three eggs, six 
ounces of sifted sugar, and four of clarified butter ; turn the mixture 
into a very clean stewpan, and stir it without ceasing over a slow fire 
until it becomes thick, but on no account allow it to boil. Wben it 
is tolerably cool add a class of brandy, or half a one of noyau, pour 
the pudding into a disn lined with very thin puff paste, and bake it 
half an hour in a moderate oven. 

Bread-crumbs,. 2 oz.; cream, 1 pint; pounded almonds, i lb.; 
bitter almonds, 6 ; yolks of 7, whites of 3 eggs ; sugar, 6 oz. : butter, 
4 oz. ; brandy, 1 wmeglassful, or ^ glass of noyau : i hour, moderate 



THE YOUNQ WIPES PUDDING. 

(Atdkor's Receipt.') 

Break separately into a cup four perfectly sweet eggs, and with 
the point of a small three-pronged fork clear them from the specks. 
Throw them, as they are done, into a large basin, or a bowl, and 
beat them up lightly for four or five minutes ; then add by degrees 
two ounces and a half of pounded sugar, with a very small pinch of 
salt, and whisk the mixture well, holding the fork rather loosely 
between the thumb and fingers ; next, grate in the rind of a quite 
fresh lemon, or substitute for it a tablespoonful of lemon-brandy, or 
of orange-flower water, which should be thrown in by degrees, and 
stirred briskly to the eggs. Add a pint of cold new milk, and pour 
the pudding into a well buttered dish. Slice some stale bread, some- 
thing more than a quarter of an inch thick, and with a very small 
cake-cutter cut sumcicnt rounds from it to cover the top of Ihe 
pudding ; butter them thickly with ^ood butter ; lay them, with the 
dry side undermost, upon the puddmg, sift sugar thickly on them, 
and set the dish gently into a Dutch or American oven, which 
should be placed at the distance of a foot or more from a moderate 
fire. An hour of very slow baking will be just sufficient to render 
the pudding firm throughout; but should the fire be fierce, or the 
oyen placed too near it, tne receipt will fail. 

Obs. — We give minute directions for this 'dish, l)ccause though 
simple, it is very delicate and good, and the same instructions will 
serve for all the varieties of it which follow. The cook who desires 
to succeed with them, must take the trouble to regulate properly the 



4S6 XODEBN COOKERY. [chap. xd. 

heat of the oven in which they are baked. When it is necessary ta 
place them in that of the kitchen-range the door should be left open 
for a time to cool it down (should it be very hot), before they are 
placed in it : and they may be set upon a plate or dish reversed, if 
the iron should still remain greatly heated 

THE GOOD daughter's HINCEMBAT PUDDING. 

(Avihor's Receipt.^ 

Lay into a rather deep tart-dish some thin slices of French roll 
very slightly spread with butter and covered with a thick layer of 
mincemeat i place a second tier lightly on these, covered in* the same 
way with the mincemeat ; then pour gently in a custard made with 
three well- whisked e^gs, three-quarters of a pint of new milk or thin 
cream, the slightest pinch of salt, and two ounces of su^ar. Let the 
pudding stand to soak for an hour, then bake it gently until it la 

Suite firm in the centre : this will be in from thiee-quarters of an 
our to a full hour. 

MRS. HOWITT's pudding. 

(Avthor's Receipt.) 

Butter lightly, on both sides, some evenly cut slices of roll, or of 
light bread freed from crust, and spread the tops thickly but uni- 
formly with good orange-marmalade. Prepare as much only in this 
way as will cover the surface of the pudding without the edges of 
the bread overlaying each other, as this would make it sink to the 
bottom of the dish. Add the same custard as for the mincemeat- 
pudding, but flavour it with French brandy only. Let it stand for 
an hour, then place it gently in a slow oven and bake it until it is 
quite set, but no longer. It is an excellent and delicate pudding 
when properlv baked ; but like all which are composed in part (? 
custard, it will be spoiled by a fierce degree of heat. The bread 
should be of a light clear brown, and the custard, under it, smooth 
and firm. This may be composed, at choice, of the yolks of four and 
whites of two eggs, thoroughly whisked, fiist without and then with 
two tablespoonsful of fine sugar * to these the milk or cream may 
then be added. 

AN EXCELLENT LEMON PUDDING. 

Beat well together four ounces of fresh butter creamed, and dght 
of sifted sugar ; to these add gradually the yolks of m and the 
whites of two eggs, with the grated rind and the strained juice of one 
large lemon : — this last must be added by slow d^ees, and stirred 
briskly to the other ingredients. Bake the puddi^ in a dish lined

Batter, 4 oz. ; snsar, I lb. ; yolks of 6, whites of 2 eggs ; large 
lemon, 1 : f hour, 8U>w oven. 

LEMON SUET PUDDING. 

To half a pound of finely grated bread-crumbs, add six ounces of 
fresh beef-kidney suet, free from skin, and minced very small, a 
quarter of a pound of castor sugar, six ounces of currants, the grated 
rmd and the strained juice of a large lemon, and four full-sized or 
five small well-beaten eggs; pour these ingredients into a thickly-* 
buttered pan, and bake the pudding for an hour in a brisk oven, but 
draw it towards the mouth when it is of a fine brown colour. Turn 
it from the dish before it is served, and strew sifted sugar over it or 
not, at pleasure : two ounces more of suet can be added when a 
larger proportion is liked. The pudding is very good without the 
currants. 

Bread-crumbs, 8 oz. ; beef-suet, 6 oz.; pounded sugar, 3^ oi.; 
lemon, 1 largp; currants, 6 oz.; eggs, 4 large, or 5 small: 1 hour, 
brisk oven. 

BAKEWELL PUDDING. 

This pudding is famous not only in Derbyshire, but in several of 
our northern counties, where it is usually served on all holiday- 
occasions. Line a shallow tart-dish with quite an inch-deep layer of 
several kinds of good preserve mixed together, and intermingle with 
them from two to three ounces of candied citron or orange-rind. 
Beat well the yolks of ten eggs, and add to them gradually half a 
pound of sifted sugar ; when they are well mixed, pour in by degrees 
half a pound of good clarified butter, and a little ratifia or any other 
flavour that may be preferred ; fill the dish two- thirds full with this 
mixture, and bake tne pudding for nearly an hour in a moderate 
oven. Half the quantity ^vill be sufficient for a small dish. 

Mixed preserves, IJ to 2 lbs.; yolks of eggs, 10; sugar, ^ lb.: 
butter, i lb. ; ratifia, lemon-brandy, or other flavouring, to the taste . 
baked, moderate oven, f to 1 hour. * 

Obs. — This is a rich and expensive, but not very r^ned pudding 
A variation of it, known in the south as an Alderman*s Pudding, is 
we think, stiperior to it. It is made without the candied peel, and 
with a layer of apricot-jam only, six ounces of butter, six of sugar 
the yolks of six, and the whites of two eggs. 

RATIFIA PUDDING. 

Havour a pint and a half of new milk rather highly with bitter 
almonds, blam^ed and bruised, or, should their use be objected to. 



428 HODERN COOKEBT. [CHJLP. ZJX. 

with three or four bay leares and a little dnnamon ; add a few ^raim 
of salt, and from four to six ounces of sucar in lumps, according to 
the taste. When the whole has simmered gently for some minutes, 
strain off the milk through a fine sieve or muslin, put it into a clean 
saucepan, and when it asain boils stir it gradually and quickly to six 
well-beaten eggs which have been likewise strained ; let the mixture 
cool, and then add to it a glass of brandy. Lay a half-paste round a 
well-buttered dish, and sprinkle into it an ounce of ratifiaa finely 
crumbled, grate the rind of a lemon over, and place three ounces of 
whole ratinas upon them, pour in sufficient of the custard to soak 
them ; an hour afterwards add the remainder, and send the pudding 
to a gentle oven : half an hour will bake it 

New milk, 1} pint ; bitter almonds, 6 or 7 (or bay leaves, 3 to 5, 
and bit of cinnamon) ; sugar, 4 to 6 oz. ; ^gs, 6 ; brandy, 1 wine- 
glassful ; ratifias, 4 oz. ; rind } lemon : baked i hour. 

THE ELEQAMT ECONOMIST'S PUDDING. 

We have already given a receipt for an exceedingly good boQed 
pudding bearing this title, but we think the baked one answers even 
better, and it is made with rather more facility. Butter a deep tart- 
dish well, cut the slices of plum-pudding to join exactly in lining it, 
and press them against it lightly to make them adhere, as without 
this x>i'ecaution they are apt to float off; pour in as much custard 
(previously thickened and left to become cold), or any other sweet 
pudding mixture, as will fill the dish almost to the brim ; cover the 
top with thin slices of the plum pudding, and bake it in a slow oven 
from thirty minutes to a lull hour, according to the quantity and 
quality of the contents. One pint of new milk poured boiling on an 
ounce and a half of toic«-fe«-moti, smoothly mixed with a quarter of a 
pint of cold milk, makes with the addition of four ounces of sugar, 
four small eggs, a little lemon-grate, and two or three bitter almonds, 
or a few drops of ratifia, an excellent pudding of this kind ; it should 
be baked nearly three-ouarters of an hour in a quite slow oven. 
Two ounces and a half or arrow-root may be used in lieu of the toat- 
leS'tnois. 

RICH BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. 

Give a good flavour of lemon-rind' and bitter almonds, or of cin- 
namon, if preferred, to a pint of new milk, and when it has simmered 
a sufficient time for this, strain and mix it with a quarter of a pint of 
rich cream ; sweeten it with four ounces of sugar in lumps, and stir 
it while still hot to five well-beaten em ; throw in a few srains of 
salt, and move the mixture brisklv with a spoon as a glass of brandy 
is added to it. Have ready in a thickly-buttered dish three layers of 
thin bread and butter cut from a half-quartern loaf^ with four ounces 
of currants, and one and a half of finely shred candied peel, strewoi 



CHAP. XXI.] BAKED PUDDINGS. 429 

between and over them ; pour the eggs and milk on them by d^reesi 
letting the bread absorb one portion before another is added : it should 
0oak for a couple of hours before the pudding is taken to Uie oven, 
which should be a moderate one. Half an hour will bake it. It is 
very good when made with new milk only ; and some persons use no 
more than a pint of liquid in all, but part of the whites of the eggs 
may then be omitted. Cream may be substituted for the entire 
quantity of milk at pleasure. 

Kew milk, 1 pint; rind of small lemon, and 6 bitter almonds

COMMON BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. 



Sweeten a pint and a half of milk with four ounces of Lisbon 
sugar ; stir it to four larse well-beaten ^;gs, or to five small ones, 
ffrate half a nutmeg to them, and pour the mixture into a dish which 
Holds nearly three pints, and which is filled almost to the brim with 
layers of bread and butter, between which three ounces of currants 
hare been strewed. Lemon-nrate, or orange-flower water can be 
added to this pudding instead of nutmeg, when preferred. From 
three quarters of an hour to an hour will bake it.

them closely, and let them stand until the bread is well soaked ; then 
stir to them three ounces of sugar, fiye eggs, leaving out two of the 
whites, two ounces of candied oran^-rind, sliced thm, and a flavour- 
in^ of nutm^ ; when the mixture is nearly or quite cold pour it into 
a oish, and pkoe liffhtly over the top the whites of three eggs beaten 
to a firm firoth, and mixed at the instant with three large tablespoons- 
fnl of silled sugar. Bake the pudding for half an hour in a moderate 
oven. The icing may be omitted, and an ounce and a half of butter, 
just warmed, put into the dish before the pudding, and plenty of 
sugar sifted over it just as it is sent to the oven, or it may be made 
without either

plate, stir to them four ounces of sugar, six ounces of currants, one 
and a half of candied orange or citron, and five eggs. 



OR SOUJEE PUDDING. 

Drop lightly into a pint and a half of boiling milk two lai^ 
tablespoonsful of semouuna, and stir them toother as this is done, 
that the mixture may not be lumpy; contmue the stirring from 
eight to ten minutes, then throw in two ounces of good butter, and 
three and a half of pounded susar, or of the finest Lisbon ; next add 
the grated rind of a lemon, and, while the semoulina is still warm, 
beat gradually and briskly to it five well-whisked eggs ; pour it 
into a buttered dish, and bake it about half an hour in a moderate 
oyen. Boil the soujee exactly as the semoulina.

FRENCH SEMOULINA PUDDING. 

Or Oateau de Senunde. 

Infiise by the side of the fire in a quart of new milk, the very 
thin rind of a fine fresh lemon, and when it has stood for half an 
hour bring it slowly to a boil: simmer it for four or five minutes, 
then take out the lemon rind, and throw lightly into the milk, 
stirring it all the time, five ounces of the best quality of semoulina ;* 
let it boil over a gentle fire for ten minutes, then add four ounces of 
sugar roughly powdered, three of fresh butter, and less than a sm^ 
quarter-teaspoonful of salt; boil the mixture for two or three 
additional minutes, keeping it stirred without ceasing ; take it from 
the fire, let it cool a little, and stir to it briskly, and by degrees, ^e 
yolks of six eggs and the whites of four vsell beaten together, and 
strained or prepared for use as directed at page 395, four or five 
bitter almonds, poimded with a little sugar, will heighten the flavour 
pleasantly to many tastes. When the pudding is nearly cold, pour

SAXE-GOTHA PUDDING^ OR TOUBTB. 

Blanch and pound to the smoothest possible paste, a couple of 
dunces of Jordan almonds, and four or fiye bitter ones ; add to them, 
spoonful by spoonful quite at first, four eggs which have been 
whisked very light; throw in gradually two ounces of pounded 
sugar, and then four ounces of the finest bread crumbs. Just melt, 
but without heatinff, two ounces of fresh butter, and add it in very 
small portions to the other ingredients, beatins each well to them 
until It ceases to appear on the surface, rour the paste thus 
prepared upon a pint of red currants, ready mixed in a tart-dish with 
four ounces of pounded sugar, and bake them gently for about half 
an hour. Raspberries and currants mixed, and Kentish or morella 
cherries, will make most excellent yarieties of this dish : the Kentish 
cherries should be stoned for it, the morellas left entire. Should the 
paste be considered too rich, a part or the whole of the butter can be 
omitted ; or again, it may on occasion be made without the almonds ; 
but the reader is recommended to try the receipt in the first instance 
without any variation from it. The crust will be found delicious if 
well made. Like all mixtures of the kmd it must be kept light by 
constant beating, as the various ingredients are added to the effgs, 
which should tiiemselves be whisked to a very light froth before 
they are used.

BUgiit', 2 oz. ; bread-crumbs, 4 oz. ; fresh butter, 2 oz. Red currants,

BADEN-BADEN PUDDINGS. 

Prepare the same paste as for the preceding receipt, and add to it 
by degrees a couple of tablespoonsfuls of fine raspberry, strawberry, 
or apricot jam, which has previously been worked smooth with the 
back of a s]^n ; half fill some buttered patty-pans or small cups 
with the mixture and bake the puddings in a eeiitle oven from 
fifteen to twenty minutes, or rather longer should it be veiy slow. 
For variety, omit the preserve, and flavour the puddings with the 
lightly grated rind or a fresh lemon, and with an ounce or so of 
candied peel shred small ; or with a little vanilla pounded with a

BUTHERLAMD OR CASTLE PUDDINGS. 

Take an equal weight of eggs in the shell, of good hutter, of fine 
dry flour, and of sifted sugar. Finst, whisk iJie eggs for ten minutes 
or until they appear extremely lights then throw in the sugar 
by degrees, and continue the whi3dng for four or five minutes; 
next, strew in the flour, also gradiudly, and when it appears 
smoothly blended with the other ingredients, pour the butter to 
them in small portions, each of whicn should be beaten in until 
there is no appearance of it left. It should preyiously be just 
liquefied with the least possible degree of heat : tnis may be effected 
by putting it into a well-warmed saucepan, and shaking it round 
untu it is dissolved. A grain or two of salt should be thrown in 
with the flour ; and the rind of half a fine lemon rasped on sugar or 
grated, or some pounded mace, or any other flavour can be added at 
choice. Pour the mixture directly it is ready into well-buttered 
cups, and bake the puddings from twenty to twenty-five minutes. 
When cold they resemble gw)d pound cakes, and may be served as 
such. Wine sauce should oe sent to table with them. 

Eggs, 4; their weight in flour, sugar, and butter; UtUe salt; 
flavouring of pounded mace or lemon-rind. 

Obs.—Three egg9 are sufficient for a small dish of these puddings. 
They may be varied with an ounce or two of candied citron ; or 
with a spoonful of brandy, or a little orange-flower water. The 
mode we have given of making them will be found perfectly suc- 
cessful if our directions be follow^ with exactness. In a slow oven 
they will not be too much baked in half an hour. 

MADELEINE PUDDINGS. 

To be served cokL 

Take the same ingredients as for the Sutherland puddings, bat 
clarify an additional ounce of butter ; skim, and then fill some round 
tin pattypans with it almost to the brim ; pour it from one to the 
other until all have receive a sufficient coating to prevent the 
puddings from adhering to them, and leave half a. teaspoonful in 
each ; mix the remainder with the e^;s, sugar, and flour, beat the 
whole up ver^ lightly, fill the pans about two-thirds full, and put 
them directly into a rather brisk oven, but draw them towards the 
mouth of it when they are sufficiently coloured; from fifteen to 
eighteen minutes will bake them. Turn them out, and drain them 
on a sheet of paper. When they are quite cold, with the point of 
the knife take out a portion of the tops, hollow the pudding a little, 
and fill them with rich apricot-jam, well mixed with half its wdght 
of pounded almonds, of whidi two in eveiy ounce should be bitter 
ones

A GOOD FRENCH BICB PUDDING, OB 0I.TEAJ DE BIZ. 

Swell gently in a quart of new milk, or in equal parts of milk and 
cream, seven ounces of the best Carolina rice, which has been cleared 
of the discoloured grains, and washed and drained; when it is 
tolerably tender, add to it three ounces of fresh butter, and five of 
sugar roughly powdered, a/cto grains of salt, and the lightly grat^ 
rind of a fine lemon, and simmer the whole until the rice is swollen 
to the utmost ; then take it from the fire, let it cool a little, and stir 
to it quickly, and by degrees, the well-beaten yolks of six full-sized 
^gs. Four into a small copper stewpan* a couple of ounces of 
(^ified butter, and incline it m such a manner that it may receive 
an equal coating in every part; then turn it upside down for an 
instant, to drain off the superfluous butter; next, throw in some 
exceedingly fine light crumbs of stale bread, and shake them 
entirely over it, turn out those which do not adhere, and with a 
small brush or feather sprinkle more clarified butter slightly on 
those which line the pan. Whisk quickly the whites of the eggs to 
snow, stir them gently to the rice, and pour the mixture soflly into 
the stewpan, that the bread-crumbs may not be displaced; put 
it immediately into a moderate oven, and let it remain in a full hour. 
It will then, if properly baked, turn out from the mould or pan well 
browned, quite firm, and having the appearance of a cake; but a 
fierce heat will cause it to break, and present an altogetiier un- 
sightly appearance. In a very slow oven a longer time must be 
allowed for it. 

New milk, or milk and cream, 1 quart; Carolina rice, 7 oz.: f 
hour. Fresh butter, 3 oz. ; sugar, in lumps, 5 oz. ; rind, 1 large 
lemon: ) to 1^ hour Eggs, 6: baked in a moderate oven, 1 
hour. 

Obs,—Aji excellent variety of this gateau is made with cocoa-nut 
flavoured milk, or cream (see Chapter XXm.), or with either of 
these poured boiling on six ounces of Jordan almonds, finely pounded, 
and mixed with a dozen bitter ones, then wrun^ from them with 
strong pressure ; it may likewise be flavoured with vanilla, or with 
candied orange-blossoms, and covered at the instant it is dished, 
with strawbeny, apple, or any other clear jelly. 

A COMMON BICE PUDDING. 

Throw six ounces of rice into plenty of cold water, and boil it 
gently from eight to ten minutes ; drain it well in a sieve or strainer, 
and put it into a dean saucepan with a quart of milk ; let it stew 

* One vbicb holds alK>at five pints is 'wc U adapted to the purpose. When

QUITE CHEAP RICE PUDDING. 

Boil the rice in water, as for a currie, and while it is still wazxn, 
mix with it a pint and a half of milk, and three fresh or four or five 
French eggs (at many seasons of the year these last, which aze 
always cheap, are very goody and answer excellently for puddings.) 
Sweeten it with pale brown sugar, grate nutmeg on the top^ and 
bake it iilowly until it is firm in erery part. 

RICHER RICE PUDDING. 

Wash very clean four ounces of whole rice, pour on it a pint and 
a half of new milk, and stew it slowly till quite tender; before it is 
taken from the fire, stir in two ounces of good butter, and three of 
sugar ; and when it has cooled a little, add four well- whisked eggs, 
and the grated rind of half a lemon. Bake the pudding in a gentibe 
oven from thirty to forty minutes. As rice requires long bbilmg to 
render it soft in milk, it may be partially stewed in water, the 
quantity of milk diminished to a pint, and a little thick sweet cream 
mixed with it, before the other ingredients are added.

the grated rind of a small lemon, and the yolks of four large, or of 
five small eggs. Four the mixture into a well-buttered dish, and 
lay lightly and equally over the top the whites of four eggs beaten 
as for sponge cakes, and mixed at the instant with from four to fire

CHAP.XXI.3 BAKED PUDDINGS. 435 

Ohs.—A couple of ounces of Jordan almonds, -with two or three 
bitter ones, pounded quite to a paste, will improve this dish, whethtf 
znized with the puddmg itself^ or with the meringue, 

A GOOD aROUND RICE PUDDING. 

"Mix very smoothly five ounces of flour of rice (or of groimd rioe, 
if preferred), with half a pint of milk, and pour it into a pint and a 
half more which is hoiling fast ; keep it stirred constantly oyer a 
gentle fire from ten to twelve minutes, and be particularly careful 
not to let it bum to the pan ; add to it before it is taken from the 
fire, a quarter of a pound of good butter, from five to six ounces of 
gogar, roughly powdered, and a few grains of salt ; turn it into a 
pan, and stir it for a few minutes, to prevent its hardening at the 
top ; then mix with it, by degrees but quickly, the yolks of eight 
^gs, and the whites of two, the grated or raisped rind of a fine 
lemon, and a glass of brandy. Lay a border of rich paste round a 
buttered dish, pour in the pudding, strain a little clarified butter over 
the top, moisten the paste with a brush, or small bunch of feathers 
dipped in cold water, and sift plenty of sugar on it, but less over the 
pudding itself. Send it to a very gentle oven to be baked for three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Bice-flour (or groimd rice), 5 oz. ; new milk, 1 quart : 10 to 12 
minutes. Butter, 4 oz. ; sugar, 5 to 6 oz. ; salt, i saltspoonful ; yolks, 
6 eggs ; whites, 2 ; rind, 1 large lemon ; brandy, large wineglassful : 
j- hour, slow oven. 

Ob$, — These proportions are suflicient for a pudding of larser size 
than those served usually at elegant tables; they will mdce two 
Bmall ones ; or two-thirds of the quantity may be taken for one of ^ 
moderate size. Lemon-brandy or ratifia, or a portion of each, may - 
be used to give it flavour, with good effect ; and it may be enriched, 
if this be desired, by adding to the other ingredients from three to 
four ounces of Jordan almonds, finely pounded, and by substitutiDg 
cream for half of the milk. 

COMMON GROUND RICE PUDDING. 

One pint and a half of milk, three ounces and a half of rice, three 
of Lisbon sugar, one and a half of butter, some nutmeg, or lemon- 
grate, and four eggs, baked slowly for half an hour, or more, if not 
quite firm. 

GREEN GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. 

Boil together, from ten to twelve minutes, a pound of green 
gooseberries, five ounces of sugar, and rather more than a quarter of 
a pint of water : then beat the fruit to a mash, and stir to it an 
ounce and a half of fresh butter ; when nearly, or quite cold, add 



436 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. xxL 

two ounces and a half of very fine bread-cmmbs, and four irell 
whisked eggs. Bake the pudding gently from half to three-quarten 
of an hour. To make a finer one of the kind, work the fhiit 
through a sieve, mix it with four or five crushed Naples hMwiHn, 
and use double the quantity of butter. 

Green gooseberries, 1 lb. ; sugar, 5 oz.; vrater, full } pint: 10 to 
12 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 2) oz. ; eggs, 4 : } to | hour. 

POTATO PUDDING. 

TVith a pound and a quarter of fine mealy potatoes, boiled yeiy 
dry, and mashed perfectly smooth while hot, mix three ounces A 
butter, five or six of sugar, five eggs, a few grains of salt, and the 
crated rind of a small lemon. Pour the mixture into a well-buttered 
dish, and bake it in a moderate oven for nearly three-quarters of an 
hour. It should be turned out and sent to table with fine sugar 
sifted over it ; or for variety, red currant jeUy, or any other preserve, 
may be spread on it as soon as it is dished. 

Potatoes, 1^ lb. ; butter, 3 oz.; sugar, 5 or 6 oz.; ^gs, 5 or 6; 
lemon-rind, 1 ; salt, few grains : 40 to 45 minutes. 

Ohs, — ^When cold, this pudding eats like cake, and may be served 
as such, omitting, of course, the sugar or preserve when it is dished. 

A RICHER POTATO PUDDING. 

Beat well together fourteen ounces of mashed potatoes, four 
ounces of butter, four of fine sugar, five eggB, the grated rind of 
a small lemon, and a slight pinch of salt; add half a glass of 
brandy, and pour the pudding into a thickly-buttered dish or 
mould, ornamented with slices of candied orance or lemon rind; 
pour a little clarified butter on the top, and men sift plenty of 
white sugar over it. 

Potatoes, 14 oz. ; butter, 4 oz. ; sugar, 4 oz. ; esgs, 5 ; lemon rind, 
1 ; little salt ; brandy, i glassful ; candied peiuT 1} to 2 oz. : 40 
minutes. 

Ohs. —The potatoes for these receipts should be lightly and care- 
fully mashed, but never pounded in a mortar, as that will convert 
them into a heavy paste. The better plan is to nrepare them by 
Captain Kater's receipt (Chapter XVU.) when tney will fall to 
powder almost of themselves ; or they may be grated while hot 
through a wire sieve. From a quarter to a half pint of cream is, by 
many cooks, added always to potato puddings. 

▲ GOOD SPONGE CAKE PUDDING. 

Slice into a well-buttered tart-dish three penny sponge biscuits^ 
and place on them a couple of ounces of candied orange or lemon 
rind cut in strips. Whisk thoroughly six eggs, and stir to them 



CHAP. XXI.] BAKED PUDDINGS. 437 

boiling a pint and a quarter of new milk, in which three cnnces of 
sugar nave been dissolved ; grate in the rind of a small lemon, and 
when they are somewhat cooled, add half a wineglassful of brandy; 
while still just warm, x>onr the mixture to the cakes, and let it 
remain an hour ; then strain an ounce and a half of clarified butter 
over the top, or strew pounded sugar rather thickly on it, and bake 
the pudding three quarters of an hour or longer in a gentle oven. 

Sponge ^es, 3 ; candied peel, 2 oz. ; eggs, 6 ; new milk, 1| ipint; 
sugar, 3 oz. ; lemon-rind, 1 ; brandy, i ^ass ; butter, 1 oz. ; sifted 
sugar, 1^ oz. : | hour. 

CAEE AND CTTSTARD, AND YARIOUS OTHER INEXPENSITE 
PUDDINGS. 

Even when very dry, the remains of a sponge or a Savoy cake 
will serve excellently for a pudding, if lightlv broken up, or 
crumbled, and intermixed or not, with a few ratinas or macaroons, 
which should also be broken up. A custard composed of four eggs 
to the pint of milk if small, and three if very large and fresh, and 
not very highly sweetened, should be poured over the cake half an 
hour at'^least before it is placed in the oven (which should be slow) ; 
and any flavour given to it which may be liked. An economical and 
clever cook will seldom be at a loss for compounding an inexpensive 
and good pudding in this wav. More or less of the cake can be 
used as may be convenient, rart of a mould of sweet rice or the 
zemains of a dish of ArocS Doc£ (see Chapter XXUI.), and various 
other preparations may be turned to account in a similar manner ; 
but the custard should be perfectly and equally mingled with what- 
ever other ingredients are used. Macaroni boiled tender in milk, 
or in milk and water, will make an excellent pudding; and sago 
stewed very thick, will sui)ply another ; the custard may be mixed 
with this last whUe it is still just warm. Two ounces well washed, 
and slowly heated in a pint of liquid, will be tender in from fifteen 
to twenty minutes. All these puddings will require a gentle oven, 
and will be ready to serve when they are firm in the centre, and do 
not stick to a Imife when plunged into it. 

BAKED APPLE PUDDING, OR CUSTARD. 

Weigh a pound of good boiling apples after they are pared and 
cored, and stew them to a perfectly smooth marmalade, with six 
ounces of sugar, and a spoonful or two of wine ; stir them often that 
ihev may not stick to the pan. Mix with them while thev are 
still quite hot, three ounces of butter, the grated rind and the 
strained juice of a lemon, and lastly, stir in by degrees the well- 
beaten yolks of five eggs, and a dessertspoonful of flour, or in lieu of 
the last, three or fourNaples* biscuits, or macaroons crushed small. 
BflJ^e the pudding for a full half hour in a moderate oven, or longer 



438 MODEBN COOKEBT. [chap. XXL 

should it be not quite firm in the middle. A little clarified batter 
poured on the top, with sugar silled over, improves all baked 
puddings. 

Apples 1 lb. ; sugar, 6 oz. ; wine 1 glassful ; butter, 8 oz. ; juiee 
and rmd, 1 lemon ; 5 eggs : i hour, or more. 

Ob*. — Many cooks press the apples through a siere after they are 
boiled, but tiiis is not needful when they are of a good siid, 
and stewed, and beaten smooth. 

DUTCH CUSTARD; OR BAKED RASPBERRY PUDDING. 

Lay into a tart-dish a border of pufif-paste, and a pint and a half of 
fireshly-gathered raspberries, well mixed with three ounces of sugar. 
Whisk thoroughly six lar^e eggs with three ounces more of sugar, 
and pour it over the fruit : hSke the pudding from twenty-five to 
thirty minutes in a moderate oven. 

Break the eggs one at a time into a cup, and with the point of a 
small three-pronged fork take off the specks or germs, before they 
are beaten, as we have directed in page 424. 

Baspberries, 1) pint ; sugar, 6 oz. ; eggs, 6 : 25 to 30 minutes. 

GABRIELLe's PUDDING; OR SWEET CASSEROLE OF RICE- 

Wash half a pound of the best Carolina rice, drain it on a hair- 
sieve, put it into a very dean stewpan or saucepan, and pour on it a 
quart of cold new milk. Stir them well together, and place them 
near the fire that the rice may swell very gradually; then let it 
simmer as gently as possible for about half an hour, or until it b^ina 
to be quite tender ; mix with it then, two ounces of fresh butter and 
two and a half of pounded sugar, and let it continue to simmer softly 
until it is dry and sufiiciently tender,* to be easily crashed to a 
smooth paste with a strong wooden spoon. Work it to this pointy 
and then let it cool. Before it is taken from the fire, scrape mto it 
the outside of some sugar which has been rubbed upon the rind of a 
ftesti lemon. Have r^y a tin mould of pretty form, well buttered 
in every part ; press the rice into it while it is still warm, smooth the 
surface, and let it remain until cold. Should the mould be one which 
opens at the ends, like that shown in the plate at page 344, the pudding 
wUl come out easily ; but if it should be in a plain common one, just 
dip it into hot water to loosen it ; turn out tne rice, and then again 
reverse it on to a tin or dish, and with the point of a knife msA 
round the top a rim of about an inch wide ; tnen brush some clarified 
butter over me whole pudding, and set it into a brisk oven. When 
it is of an equal light golden brown draw it out, raise the cover care- 
fully where it is marked, scoop out the rice from the inside, leavinip

only a crust of about an inch thick in every part, and pour into it 
9ome preserved fruit warmed in its own syrup, or fill it wiUi a com' 
p6te of plums or peaches (see Chapter XXIIl.) ; or with some good 
apples boiled with fine suear to a smooth rich marmalade. This is a 
very good as weU as an ekgant dish : it may be enriched with more 
butter, and by substituting cream for the milk in part or entirely, 
but it is excellent without either. 

Eioe, } lb.; new milk, 1 quart: ) hour. Fresh butter, 2 oz.; 
poxmded sugar, 2| oz. ; rasped rind, 1 lemon : i hour or more. 

Obs. — The precise time of baking the pudding cannot well be 
specified : it oxily reqidres colour. 

VERMICELLI PUDDINO WITH APPLES OR WITHOUT^ AND PUDDINGS 
OF BOUJEB AND SEMOLA. 

Drop gradually into an exact quart of boiling milk four ounces of 
very fresh vermicelli, crushing it slightly with one hand and letting 
it fall gently from the fingers, and stirring the milk with a spoon 
held in the other hand, to prevent the vermicelli from gathering into 
lumps. Boil it softly until it is quite tender and very uiick, wmc^ it 
will be usually in about twenty minutes, during which time it must 
be very firequently stirred ; then work in two ounces of fresh butter 
and four of pounaed sugar ; turn the mixture into a bowl or pan, 
and stir it occasionally until it has cooled down. Whisk ^ye good' 
^ga until they are very light, beat them gradually and quickly to 
the other ingredients, add me finely grated rind of a lemon or a httle 
lemon-brandy or ratifia, and pour the pudding when nearly cold into 
a buttered dish, and just cover the surface with apples pared, cored, 
and quartered ; press them into the pudding-mixture, to the top of 
whicn they will immediately rise again, and place the dish in a 
very gentle oven for three - <][uarters of an hour, or longer if 
needed to render the &uit auite tender. The apples should be 
of the best quality for cooking. This is an exceedingly nice 
puddine if well made and well baked. The butter can be omitted 
to simplify it. 

Milk, 1 quart ; vermicelli, 4 oz. : boiled about 20 minutes. Butter, 
2 oz. ; (when used) pounded sugar, i lb. ; eggs, 6 : baked slowfy f 
hour or more. 

For a plain common vermicelli pudding omit the apples and one 
egg : for a very good one use six eggs, and the butter ; and flavour it 
delicately with orange-flower water, vanilla, or aught else that may 
be preferred. We have often had an ounce or two of candied citron 
diced very thin mingled with it. 

Puddings of soujee and semola are made in precisely the same 
manner, with four ounces to the quart of milk, and ten minntef 
boiling.

RICE A LA. TATHEK, OR RICE PUDDING ▲ LA TATHEK. 

(Extremal/ Oood.) 

Blanch, and then pound 
carefully to the smoothest 
possible pa8t« four ounces of. 
fine Jordan almonds and half ( 
a dozen bitter ones, moisten- ^ 
mg them with a few drops of 
Crater to prevent their oding. 
Stir to them by slow decrees a quart of boiling milk, which should 
be new, wring it again closely from them through a thin doth, which 
will absorb it less than a tammy, and set it aside to cooL Wash 
thoroughly, and afterwards soak for about ten minutes seven ounces 
of Carolina rice, drain it well from the water, pour the almond-milk 
upon it, bring it very slowly to boil, and simmer it softly until it is 
tolerably tender, taking the precaution to stir it often at first that it 
may not gather into lumps nor stick to the pan. Add to it two 
ounces of fresh butter and four of pounded sugar, and when it is per- 
fectly tender and dry, proceed with it exactly as for Gabrielle*a 
pudding, but in moulding the rice press it closely and evenly in, and 
nollow It in the centre, leaving the edge an inch thick in eveiy part, 
that it may not break in the oven. The top must be slightly brushed 
with butter before it is baked, to prevent its becoming too dry, but a 
morsel of white blotting paper will take up any portion that may 
remain in it. When it is ready to serve, pour into it a large jarful 
of apricot jam, and send it immediatelv to table. If well made it will 
be delicious. It may be served cold (though this is less usual), and 
decorated with small thin leaves of citron-rind, cut with a minute 
paste-cutter. The same preparation may be used also for Gabiielle's 
pudding, and filled with hot preserved mdt, the rice scooped from the 
inside being mixed with the syrup. 

GOOD YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

To make a very good and licht Yorkshire pudding, take an equal 
number of eggs and of heaped tablespoonsftu of flour, with a tea- 
spoonful of scut to six. of these. Whisk the eggs toeE, strain, and mix 
tnem gradually with the flour, then pour in by decrees as much new 
milk as will reduce the batter to the consistence oirather thin cream. 
The tin which is to receive the pudding must have been placed for 
some time previously imder a jomt that has been put down to roast 
one of beef is usualljr preferred. Beat the batter briskly and lightljr 
the instant before it is poured into the pan, watch it carefully that it 
may not bum, and let the edges have an equal share of the fire. 
When the pudding is quite firm in every part, and well-coloured on

the sarface, turn it to brown the under side. This is best accom- 
plished by first dividing it into quarters. Li Yorkshire it is made 
much thinner than in the south, roasted generally at an enormous 
fire, and riot turned at all : currants there are sometimes added 
to it. 

^Kg8« 6 ; flour, 6 heaped tablespoonsful, or from 7 to 8 oz. ; milk» 
nearly or quite 1 pint ; salt, 1 teaspoonful : 2 hours. 

Om. — Tnis pudding should be quite an inch thick when it is 
browned on both sides, but only half the depth when roasted in the 
Yorkshire mode. The cook must exercise her discretion a little in 
mixing the batter, as finom the variation of weight in flour, and in the 
size of eggs, a little more or less of milk may m required : the whole 
should be rather more liquid than for a boiled pudcung. 

COMMON YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Haifa pound of flour, three eggs (we would recommend a fourth), 
rather more than a pint of milk, and a teaspoonful of salt. 

NORMANDY PUDDING. (gOOD.) 

Boil, until very soft and dry, eight ounces of rice in a pint and 
a half, or rather more, of water,* stir to it two ounces of fresn butter 
and three of sugar, and simmer it for a few minutes after they are 
added ; then pour it out, and let it cool for use. Strip from the 
stalks as many red currants, or Kentish cherries, as will fill a tart- 
dish of moderate size, and for each pint of the fruit allow from three 
to four ounces of sugar. Line the bottom and sides of a deep dish 
with part of the rice ; next, put in a thick layer of fruit and sugar ; 
then one of rice and one of fruit altematebr until the dish is full. 
Sufficient of the rice should be reserved to form a rather thick layer 
at the top : smooth this equally with a knife, sift sugar thickly on it, 
or brush it with good cream, and send the pudding to a moderate 
oven for half an hour,' or longer, should it be laige. Morella cher- 
ries, with a little additional sugar, make an excellent pudding of this 
kind. 

COMMON BAKED RAISIN PUDDING. 

Beat well together three-quarters of a pound of flour, the same 
quantity of raisins, six ounces of beef- suet, finely chopped, a small 
pinch of salt, some grated nutmeg, and three eggs whicn have been 
thoroughly whisked, and mixed with about a quarter of a pint of 
milk, or less than this, should the eggs be laige. Pour the whole 
into a buttered dish, and bake it an hour and a quarter. For a large

or the grated rind of a lemon, four large eggs, and as much milk as 
may be needed to make the whole into a veiy thick batter : bake the 
puading a few minutes longer than the preceding one. The addition 
of sugar will be found no improvement as it will render it much less 
light. 

Sultana raisins are well adapted to these puddings, as they contun 
no pips, and from their delicate size sooner become tender in the 
baking than the larger kinds. 

THE POOR author's PUDDING. 

Flavour a quart of new milk by boiling in it for a few minutes 
half a stick of well-bruised cinnamon, or the thin rind of a small 
lemon ; add a few grains of salt, and three ounces of su^ar, and turn 
the whole into a deep basin : when it is ^uite cold, stir to it three 
well-beaten eg^ and strain the mixture mto a pie-dish. Cover the 
top entirely with slices of bread free from crust, and half an iDch 
thick, cut so as to join neatly, and buttered on both sides : bake the 
pudding in a moderate oven for about half an hour, or in a Dutch 
oven before the fire. 

Kew milk, 1 quart ; cinnamon, or lemon-rind ; sugar, 3 oz. ; little 
salt ; eggs, 3 ; buttered bread : baked \ hour. 

PUDDING A LA PATSANNE. 

{Cheap and Good,) 

Fill a deep tart-dish with alternate layers of well-sugared frnit, 
and very thin slices of the crumb of a light stale loaf; let the upper 
layer be of fruit, and should it be of a dry kind, sprinkle over it 
about a dessertspoonful of water, or a little lemon-juice : rasj^berries, 
currants, and cherries, will not require this. Send the pudding to a 
somewhat brisk oven to be baked for about half an hour. The pro- 
portion of stu^ used must be regulated, of course, by the acidity of 
the fruit For a ^uart of ripe greengages, split and stoned, five 
ounces will be sufficient.

rhubarb-stalks, cut them into short lengths, and put a layer of them 
into a deep dish with a spoonful or two of Lisbon sugar; cover these 
evenly with part of a penny roll sliced thin ; add another thick layer 
of fruit and sugar, then one of bread, then another of the rhubarb ; 
cover this last with a deep layer of fine bread-cmmbs well mingled 
with about a tablespoonful of sugar, pour a little clarified butter over 
them, and send the pudding to a brisk oven. From thirty to forty 
minutes will bake it. Good boiling apples sliced, sweetened, and 
flavoured with nutmeg or crated lemon-rind, and covered with well 
buttered slices of brea^ m&e an exceUejU pudding of this kind, and

A LIGHT BAKED BATTER PUDDING. 

Wiih three heaped tablespoonsful or about six ounces of flour mix 
a small saltspoonful of salt, and add very gradutdly to it three fresh 
e^ which have been cleared in the usual way or strained, and 
wnisked to a light froth. Beat up the batter well, then stir to it by 
d^rees a pint of new milk, pour it into a buttered dish, set it imme- 
diately into a rather brisk oven, and bake it three-quarters of an hour. 
If properlv managed, it will be extremely light and delicate, and the 
surface will be cnsp. When good milk cannot be had for it, another 
^g, or the yolk of one at least, should be added. Send preserved or 
stewed fruit to table with it. The same mixture may be baked in 
buttered cups from twenty to thirty minutes, turned out, and served 
with sugar sifted thickly over. 

In some counties an ounce or two of very finely minced suet is 
usually mixed with baked batter puddings, which are enriched, but 
not improved, we think, by the addition ; but that is entirely a 
matter of taste

TO PRESERVE EGOS FRESH FOR MANY WEEKS. 

As soon as possible after the ^gs are taken from the nests, brosb 
each one separately with a thin solution of gum Arabic, bein^ care- 
ful to leave no portion of the shell uncovered by it. The half of 
each egg must first be done and left to become dry, before the 
remainder is touched, that the gum may not be rubbed off any part 
by its coming in contact, while wet, with the hand as it is held to be 
varnished, or with the table when it is laid down to harden. 

Obs. — Eggs will remain fit for use a very long time if carefiiUy 
kept ; but attention should always be given to the cleanliness of the 
shells before they are stored, as when these are soiled and then ex- 
cluded from the air, they will sometimes become very offensive.

TO COOK EGGS IN THE SHELL WITHOUT BOILTNG THESC* 

(An admirable receipt.) 

This mode of dressing eggs is not new ; it seems, indeed, to have 
been known in years long past, but not to have received the attention 
which its excellence deserved. We saw it mentioned with much 
commendation in a most useful little periodical, called the Cottags 
Oardenery and had it tested immediately with various modifications 
and vrith entire success. After many trials, we give the following as 
the beet and most uniform in its results of our numerous experiments. 
First, put some boiling water into a large basin— a slop-basin for 
example — and let it remain for a few seconds, then turn it out, lay in 
the egg (or eggs), and roll it over, to take the chill off the shell, that 
it may not crack from the sudden application of heat ; and pour in — 
and upon the egg— ^vito boiling water from a kettle, until it is com- 
pletely immersed ; put a plate over it instantlv, and let it remain, 
upon the table, for twelve minutes, when it will be found perfectly 
and beautifully cooked, entirely free from all flavour and appearance 
of ravmess, and yet so lightly and delicately dressed as to suit even 
persons who cannot take eggs at all when boiled in the usual way. 
It ^ould be turned when something more than half done, but the 
plate should be replaced as quickly as possible. Two eggs will re- 
quire scarcely more time than one ; but some additional minutes must 
be allowed for any number beyond that. The process may alw^s 
be quickened by chan^ng the water when it has cooled a little, for 
more that is fast boilmg : the eggs may, in fact, be rendered quite 
hard by the same means, but then no advantage is obtained over the 
old method of cooking them.

^rom our cookery for invalids, on account of its adaptation to the 
taste generally. 

TO BOIL EGGS IN THE SHELL. 

Even this very simple process demands a certain degree of care, for 
if the eggs be brought from a cold larder, and suddenlV plunged into 
boiling water they will frequently break immediately, and a large 
portion will often escape from the shells. In winter they should be

bran between them. He says that the salt penetrates the Bhell, and tends to 
preserye the eggs, which will require no additional salt when eaten. We give the 
information to the reader as we received it.

held for an instant over the steam from the saucepan hefore they 
are laid in, and they should be put gently into it Three minutes 
will boil thto sufficiently for persons who like the whites in a par- 
tially liquid state. Five minutes, exact time, if they be fresh and fine, 
will harden the whites only, and leave the yolks still liquid. Few 
eaters require them more dressed than this ; but eight or ten minutes 
will render them hard. Eggs should always be cooked in sufficient 
water to cover them completely. 

To boil very lightly, 3 minutes ; to render the whites firm, 4} to 5 
minutes; hard eggs, 8 to 10 minutes (15 minutes for salad 
dressing.) 



TO DRESS THE EGGS OP THE GUINEA FOWL AND BANTAM. 

The eggs of the Guinea-fowl— ^ 
which are small, very prettily 
shaped, and of a pale or full fawn- 
colour (for in this they vary)— are 
much esteemed by epicures, being 
very rich and excellent eating. They 

are generally somewhat higher in ^^ ,^ 

price than the common hens' ecgs, ^ Si^-f^^*^^*^ 

even in Norfolk, Suffialk, and other 
counties where they most abound ; and in London they are usually 
expensive. They may be cooked in the shell without bailing by the 
method we have already given : eight or nine minutes will cook 
them so. About three and a half of gentle boiling will render the 
whites firm, and ten will harden them quite through. They are often 
served instead of plovers* eggs, and are sent to table embedded in 
moss in the same manner. They may also be shelled, and used whole 
to decorate a salad. 

The eggs of the bantam, which are scarcely more than half the 
size of these, and of which the shells are much thinner, will require 
less time to cook. They form an elegant decoration for a salad, if 
boiled hard, which they will become in five or six minutes ; and for a 
mince of fowl, or veal and oysters, when poached. 

Two minutes' poaching in an enamelled saucepan* will be sufficient 
for these delicate little eggs, without positive boiling. They should 
be carefully broken and put gently into water at boiling point, bnt 
which has ceased to move, and left undisturbed by the side of the fire 
until the yolks are just set on the surface. 

Guinea-fowls' eggs, quite hard, 10 minutes. For eating (by new 
method, 8 to 9 minutes), 3 to 4 minutes. 

Bantams', hard, 6 minutes ; soil, 2| to 3 minutes. 

* In any other kind, an additional half minute may be regolred.

TO DRESS turkeys' EGGS* 

Turkeys* eggs are not, we believe, brought rery abundantly into 
the London market,* but their superiority to those of the common 
^wl is well known in the counties where the birds are principally 
reared. Though of large size they are delicate in flavour, and are 
equally valuable forthe breakfast- table— cooked simply in the shell — 
or for compounding any of the dishes for which hens* eggs are com- 
moiUy in request. They make super-excellent sauce, omlets, cus- 
tards, and puddings ; and are especially to be recommended poached, 
or served by any other of the following receipts. Those of the 
smallest size and palest colour, which are the egn of the young birds, 
are die best adapted for serving boiled in the shells : they are some- 
times almost white. Those of the full grown turkeys are thickly 
speckled, of a deep tawny hue or fawn colour. 

6 minutes will render the whites firm; 4 minutes will poach 
them. 

FORCED turkeys' EGGS (OR SWANs'). 

(An JExcellent EiUremeU^ 

Boil gently for twenty minutes in plenty of water, that they may 
be entirely covered with it, five or six fresh turkeys* eggs, and when 
they are done lift them into a large pan of water to cool. By chang- 
ing the water once or twice they will become cold more rapidly, and 
they must not be used until they are perfectly so. 

KoU them in a cloth, pressing lightly on them to break the shells ; 
dear them off, and halve the eggs evenly lengthwise. TaJce out the 
yolks with care, and pound them to a smooth paste in a mortar with 
an ounce and a half, or two ounces at the utmost, of pure-flavoured 
butter to the half dozen, a small half-teaspoonful of salt, a little finely 
grated nutmeg, and some cayenne, also in fine powder : a little mace, 
— one of the most delicate of all seasonings when judiciously used-« 
may be added with good eflect. Blend these ingredients thoroughly, 
and then add to them by degrees one raw hen's egg slightly whisked, 
and the yolk of a second, or a dessertspoonful or two of sweet rich 
cream. One common tgg is sufficient for four of the turkey egg- 
yolks. Beat up the mass, which will now be of the consistence of a 
thick batter, well and lightly, and proceed to fill the whites with it, 
having first cut a small slice from each half to make it stand. evenly 
on the dish, and hollowed the inside with the point of a sharp knife,

with a little Espagnote^ or other rich hrown gravy, or served 
without. 

Ohs. — ^We would recommend that the whites of swans* ^gs, which 
as we have said are extremely heautiful, should be filled with the 
above preparation in preference to their own yolks: they will ol 
course, require longer baking. 

TO BOIL A swan's EGG HARD. 

$ 

Swans* eggs are much more delicate than from their size, and from 
the tendencv of the birds to feed on fish might be supposed ; and 
when boilea hard and shelled, their appearance is hecnOifidy the white 
being of remarkable purity and transparency. Take as much water 
as will cover the ^g (or eggs) well in every part, let it boil quickly, 
then take it from tne fire, and as soon as tne water ceases to move 
put in the egg, and leave it by the side of the fire — without allowing 
It to boil— for twenty minutes, and turn it gently once or twice in 
the time ; then put on the cover of the stewpan and boil it gently for 
a quarter of an nour ; take it quite from the fire, and in five minutes 
put it into a basin and throw a cloth, once or twice folded, over it, 
and let it cool slowly. It will retain the heat for a very long time, 
and as it should be quite cold before it is cut, it should be boiled 
early if wanted to serve the same day. Halve it evenly with a shaip 
knife lengthwise, take out the yolk vnth care, and prepare it for 
table, either by the receipt which follows, or by that for forced eggs,

SWAINS EGG; EN SALADE* 

We found that the yolk of the egg, when boiled as above, could 
be rendered perfectly smooth and cream-like, by mashing it on a 
dish • with a broad-bladed knife, and working it well with the other 
ingredients : the whole was easily blended into a mass of unifoim 
colour, in which not the smallest lump of butter or egg was percepti- 
ble. Mix it intimately with announce or two of firai fresh butter, 
a rather high seasoning of cayenne, some salt, or a teaspoonful or 
iwo of essence of anchovies, and about as much of chili vinegar or

lemon-juice. To these minced herbs or eschalots can be added at 
pleasure. Fill the whites with the mixture, and serve tnem in a 
bowl two-thirds filled with salad, sauced as usual ; or use tliem merelj 
as a decoration for a lobster or German salad. 

TO POACH EGGS. 

Take for this purpose a wide and delicately clean pan aboat half- 
filled with the clearest spring- water ; throw in a small saltspoonful 
of salt, and place it over a fire quite free from smoke. Br*»ak some 
new laid eggs into separate cups, and do this with care, that the yolks 
may not be injured. When the water boils, draw back the pan,^,lide 
the eggs gently into it, and let them stand until the whites appear 
almost set, which will be in about a minute : then, withoui shakmg 
them, move the pan over the fire, and just simmer them from two 
minutes and a half to three minutes. Lift them out separately with 
a slice, trim quickly off the ragged edges, and serve them upon 
dressed spinach, or upon mince.d veal, turkey, or chicken ; or dish 
them for an invalid, upon delicately toasted bread, sliced thick, and 
freed from crust : it is an improvemeut to have the bread buttered* 
but it is then less wholesome. 

Comparative time of poaching egirs. Swans* eggs, 5 to 6 minutes. 
(In basin, 10 minutes.) Turkeys' eggs 4 minutes. Hens' eggs, 3 to 
3j minutes. Guinea-fowls*, 2 to 3 minutes. Bantams', 2 mmutes. 

Obs. — All eggs may be poached without boiling if kept just at sim- 
mering point, but one boil quite at last will assist to detach them from 
the stewpan, from which ihey should always be very carefully lifted 
on what is called a fish or egg -slice. There are pans made on pur- 
pose for poaching and frying them in good form ; but they do not, 
we believe, answer particularly well, if broken into cups slightly 
rubbed with butter, and simmered in them, their roundness of shape 
will be best preserved. 

POACHED EGGS WITH GRAVY. (bNTBEMETS.) 

(Eafa Poch^ au Jus, 

Dress the eggs as above, giving them as good an appearance as 
possible, lay thrm into a very hot dish, and sauce them with some

tomata-sauce well seasoned with eschalots. 



(EirPS AD FLAT. 

A pewter or any other metal plate or dish which will bear ihe fire, 
must be used for these. Just melt a slice of butter in it, then put in 
some very fresh eggs broken as for poaching ; strew a little pepper 
and salt on the top of each, and place them over a gentle fire until 
the whites are quite set, but keep them free from colour. 

This is a very common mode of preparing eggs on the continent ; 
but there is generally a slight rawness of tne surface of the yolki 
which is in a measure removed by ladling the boiling butter over 
them with a spoon as they are cooking, though a salamander held 
above them for a minute would have a better effect. Four or five 
minutes will dress them. 

Ohs, — We hope for an opportunity of inserting further reodpts for 
dishes of eggs at the end of this volume. 

MILK AND CREAM. 

Without possessing a dairy, it is quite possible for families to have 
always a sufficient provision of milk and cream for their con- 
sumption, provided tnere be a clean cool larder or pantry where it 
can be kept. It should be taken from persons who can be depended 
on for supplying it pure, and if it can be obtained from a dairy near 
at hand it will be an advantage, as in the summer it is less essy to 
preserve it sweet when it has been conveyed from a distance. It 
should be poured at once into well-scalded pans or basins kept ex- 
clusively for it, and placed on a very clean ana airy sheli^ apart from 
fdl the other contents of the larder. The fresh milk as it comes in 
should be set at one end of the shelf, and that for use should be 
taken from the other, so that none may become stale from being mis- 
placed or overlooked. The cream should be removed with a per- 
forated skimmer (or skimming-dish as it is called in dairy-countia) 
which has been dipped into cold water to prevent the cream, when 
thick, from adhering to it. Twelve hours in summer, and twenty- 
four in vnnter, will be sufficient time for the milk to stand for 
^^ creaming f^* though it may often be kept longer with advantage. 
Between two and three pints of really good milk will produce about 
a quarter of a pint of cream. In frosty weather the pans for it 
should be warmed before it is poured in. K boiled when firrt 
brought in, it will remain sweet much longer than it otherwise 
would ; but it will then be unfit to serve with tea ; though it may be 
heated afresh and sent to table with cofl^ee ; and used also for pod- 
dings, and all other varieties of milk-diet.

DEVONSHIRE^ OR CLOTTED CREAM. 

From the mode adopted in Deyonshire, and in some other cotin* 
ties, of scalding the muk in the following manner, the cream becomes 
very rich and thick, and is easily converted into excellent butter. It 
is strained into large shallow metal pans as soon as it is brought into 
the dairy and left for twelve hours at least in summer, and thirty-six 
in cold weather. It is then gently carried to a hot plate — heated by 
a fire from below — and brought slowly to a quite scalding heat but 
without being allowed to boil or even to simmer. When it is 
ready to be removed, distinct rings appear on the surface, and small 
bubbles of air. It must then be carried carefully back to the dairy, 
and may be skimmed in twelve hours afterwards. The cream sliould 
be well drained from the milk—which will be very poor— as this 
is done It may then be converted into excellent butter, merely by 
beating it with the hand in a shallow wooden tub, which is, we are 
infonned, the usual manner of making it in »maU Devonohue 
dairies. 

DD LAIT A MADAME. 

Boil a quart of new milk, and let it cool sufficiently to allow the 
cream to be taken off; then rinse an earthen jar well in every part 
with buttermilk, and while the boiled milk is still rather warm, pour 
it in and add the cream gentl}' on the top. Let it remain twenty- 
four hours, turn it into a deep dish, mix it with pounded sugar, and 
it will be ready to serve. This preparation is much eaten abroad 
during the summer, and is considered very wholesome. The milk, 
by the foregoing process, becomes a very soil curd. slighHy^ but not 
at all unpleasantly, acid in flavour. A cover, or thick folded cloth, 
should be placed on the jar after the milk is poured in, and it should 
be kept in a moderately warm place. In very sultry weather less 
time may be allowed for the milk to stand. 

Obs. — We give this and the following receipt from *i^ - .paOlished 
work which we have in progress, being always desirous to make such 
information as we possess generally useful as far as we can. 

CURDS AND WHEY. 

Rennet is generally prepared for dairy-use by butchers, and kept 
in farmhouses hung in ine chimney corners, where it will remain 
good a long time. It is the inner stomach of the calf, from which 
the curd is removed, and which is salted and stretched out to dr}' on 
splinters of wood, or strong wooden skewers. It should be preserved 
from dust and smoke (by a paper-bag or other means), and portions 
of it cut off as wanted. Soak a small bit in half a teacupful of warm 
water, and let it remain in it for an hour or two ; then pour into 



452 MODEBN COOKEBT. [cbap. xxii. 

ft quart of warm new milk a dessertspoonful of the rennet-liquor, 
and keep it in a warm place until the whey appears separated Irom 
the curd, and looks clear. The smaller the proportion of rennet 
used, the more soft and delicate will he the curd. We write these 
directions from recollection, havinfic o^i^ ^^ the dish thus prepared, 
but having no memorandum at this moment of the precise proportions 
used. L^ than an inch square of the rennet would he sufficient, ire 
think, for a gallon of milk, if some hours were allowed for it to turn. 
When rennet'Whey, which is a most valuable beverage in many cases 
of illness, is required for an invalid to drink, a bit of the rennet, after 
being quickly and slightly rinsed, ma^ be stirred at once into the 
warm milk, as the cura becoming hard is then of no consequence. It 
must be kept warm until the whey appears and is clear. It may then lie 
strained, and given to the patient to drink, or allowed to become cold 
before it is taken. In feverish complaints it has often the most benign 
effect.

TO PREPARB calf's FEET STOCK. 

The feet are usually sent 
in from the butcher's ready 
to be dressed, but as they 
are sold at a very much 
cheaper rate when the hair 
has not been cleared from 
them, and as they may 
then be depended on for 
supplying the utmost 
amount oi nutriment which 
they contain, it is oflen 
desirable to have them

boiling water and left for a minute or two untouched before they 
were scraped ;" and this method we had followed vrith entire success 
for a long time, but we afterwards discovered that the resin was 
not necessary, and that the feet could be quite as well prepared by 
mere scalding, or being laid into water at the point of boUing, and 
kept in it for a few minutes by the side of the fire. The hair, as we 
have already stated in the first pages of Chapter IX. (Veal), must 
be very closely scraped from them with a blunt-edged knife; and 
the hoofs must be removed hy being struck sharply down against 
theedgeof a strong table or sink, the leg-bone being held tightly 
in the hand. The feet must be afterwards washed delicately clean 
before they are further used. When this has been done, divide 
them at the joint, split the claws, and take away the fat that is 
between them. Should the feet be large, put a ^llon of cold water 
to the four, but from a pint to a quart less if they be of moderate 
size or small. Boil them gently down until the flesh has parted 
entirely from the bones, and the liquor is reduced nearly or quite 
half; strain, and let it stand until cold ; remove every particle of fat 
from the top before it is used, and be careful not to take tho 
sediment. 
Calf's feet (large), 4 ; water, 1 gallon : 6 to 7 hours. 

TO CLARIFY CALF's FEET STOCK. 

Break up a quart of the stock, put it into a clean stewpan with 
the whites of Hve large or of six small eggs, two ounces of sugar, and 
the strained juice of a small lemon ; place it over a gentle fire, and do 
not stir it after the scum begins to form ; when it has boiled ^\e or 
six minutes, if the liquid part be clear, turn it into a jelly-bag, and 
pass it through a second time should it not be perfectly transparent 
the first. To consumptive patients, and others requiring restoratives, 
but forbidden to take stimulants, the jelly thus prepared is of^en veiy 
acceptable, and may be taken with impunity, when it would be highly 
injurious made vrith wine. More white of egg is required fx> clarify 
it than when sugar and acid are used in larger quantities, as both of 
these assist the process. For blanc-mange omit the lemon-joice, and 
mix with the clarified stock an equal proportion of cream (for an 
invalid, new milk), with the usual flavouring, and weight of sugar ; 
or pour the boiling stock very gradually to some finely pounded 
almonds, and express it from them as directed for Quince Blamauj^e, 
allowing from six to eight ounces to the pint,

been gradually mixed with a teaspooniul of beaten white of egg ; stir 
these thoroughly together, and let them heat slowly by the side of a 
gentle fire, but do not allow the isinglass to stick to the pan. When 
the scum is well risen, which it will be after two or three minutes* 
simmering, clear it off, and continue the skimming until no more 
appears ; then, should the quantity of liquid be more than is needed, 
reauce it by quick boiling to the proper point, strain it through a 
thin muslin, and set it by for use : it will be jierfectly transparent, 
and may be mixed lukewarm with the clear and ready sweetened 
juice of various fruits, or used with the necessary proportion of syrup, 
for jellies flavoured with choice liqueurs. As the clarifying reduces 
the strength of the isinglass— or rather as a portion of it is taken up 
by the wnite of egg — an additional quarter to each ounce must b^ 
allowed for this : if the scum be laid to drain on the back of a fine 
sieve which has been wetted with hot water, a little very strong jelly 
vill drip from it. 

Isinglass, 2} oz.; water, 1 pint; beaten white of egg^ .1 tea- 
spoonful. 

Obs. — At many Italian warehouses a preparation is now sold under 
the name of isinglass, which ai>pears to us to be highly purified 
gelatine of some other kind. It is converted without trouble into a 
very transparent jelly, is free from flavour, and is less expensive than 
the genuine Russian isinglass ; but when taken for any length of 
time as a restorative, its different nature becomes perceptible. It 
answers well for the table occasionally; but it is not suited to- 
invaUds.

Pound quite to a pulp, in a marble or Wedgewood mortar, a hand- 
ful or two of young freshly-gathered spinach, then throw it into a 
hair sieve, and press througn all the juice which can be obtained from 
it ; pour this into a clean white jar, and place it in a pan of water 
tliat is at the point of boiling, and which must be allowed only to 
just simmer anerwards ; in three or four minutes the juice will be 
poached or »et : take it then gently with a spoon, and lay it upon the 
back of a fine sieve to drain. If wanted for immediate use, merely 
mix it in the mortar with some finely-powdered sugar ;• but if to be 
kept as a store, pound it with as much as will render the whole 
tolerably dry, bou it to candy-height over a very clear fire, ]four it 
out in cakes, and keep them in a tm box or canister. For this last

PREPARED APPLB OR QUINCB JUICE. 

Pour into a clean earthen pan two quans of spring \rater, and 
throw into it as quickly as they can he pared, quartered, and 
weighed, four pounds of nonsuches, pearmains, Kipstone pippins, or 
any other good boiling apples of fine flavour. When all are done, 
stew them gently until they are well broken, but not reduced ouite 
to pulp ; turn them into a jelly-bag, or strain the juice from them 
witnout pressure through a closely-woven cloth, which should be 
gathered over the fruit, and tied, and .suspended above a deep pan 
until the juice ceases to drop from it : this, if not very clear, must be 
rendered so before it is used for svrup or jelly, but for all other pur- 
poses once straining it will be suihcient. Quinces are prepared in the 
same way, and with the same proportions of fruit and water, but they 
must not be too long boiled, or the juice will become red. We have 
found it answer well to have them simmered until they are perfectly 
tender, and then to leave them with their liquor in a bowl until the 
following day, when the juice will be rich and clear. They should 
be thrown into the water very quickly after they are pared and 
weighed, as the air will soon discolour them. The juice will form a 
jelly much more easily if the cores and pips be left in the fruit 

vVater, 2 quarts ; apples or quinces, 4 lbs. 

COCOA-NUT FLAVOIRED MILK. 

{For sweet dishes^ ^c.) 

Pare the dark outer rind from a very fresh nut, and grate it on a 
fine and exceedingly clean grater , to every three ounces pour a quart 
of new milk, and simmer them very softly for three quarters of an 
hour, or more, that a full flavour of the nut may be imparted to the 
milk without its being much reduced : strain it through a fine sieve, or 
cloth, with sufficient pressure to leave the nut almost dry : it may 
then be used for blanc-mange, custards, rice, and other paddings, 
light cakes and bread. 

'Jo eacfi quart new milk, 3 oz. grated cocoa-nut : f to I hour. 

Obs. — The milk of the nut when perfectly sweet and good, may tw 
added to the other with advantage To obtain it, bore one end of the 
shell with a gimlet, and catch the liquid in a cup ; and to extricate 
the kernel, break the shell with a hammer : this is better than sawiqg 
it asunder.

with them, as well as to those who may have a distaste to the com- 
mon " stewed Jrtiit" of English cookery. If well made they are 
peculiarly delicious and refreshing, pFeservinff the pure flavour of 
the fruit of which they are composed ; while its acidity is much 
softened by the small quantity of water added to form the syrup in 
which it IS boiled. They are also more economical than tarts or 
puddings, and infinitely more wholesome. In the second course 
pastry-crust can always be served with them, if desired, in the form 
of ready baked leaves, round cakes^or any more fanciful shapes; or a 
border of these may be fastened with a little white of egg and flour 
round the edge of the dish in which the compote is served ; but rice, 
or macaroni simply boiled, or a very plain pudding is a more usual 
accompaniment. 

Compdtes vdll remain good for two or three days in a cool store- 
room, or somewhat longer, if gently boiled up for an instant a second 
tune ; but they contain generally too small a proportion of sugar to 
pre^rve them from mould or fermentation for many days. The 
syrup should be enriched with a larger quantity when they are in- 
tended for the desserts of formal dinners, as it will increase the trans- 
parency of the fruit : the juice is always beautifully clear when the 
compdtes are carefully prepared. They should be seri^ed in glass 
dishes, or in compotierSy which are of a form adapted to them. 

Compote of spnneftwt,— (Rhubarb), Take a pound of the stalks 
after they are pared^ and cut them into short lengths ; have ready a 
quarter of a pint of water boiled gently for ten minutes with five 
ounces of su^r, or with six should the fruit be very acid ; put it in, 
and simmer it for about ten minutes. Some kinds will be tender in 
rather less time, some will require more. 

Obs,— Good sugar in lump should be used for these dishes. 
Lisbon sugar will answer for them very well on ordinary occasions, 
but that. which is refined will render them much more delicate. 

Compote of green currants.— Spring water, half-pint; sugar, five 
ounces ; boiled together ten minutes. One pint of green currants 
stripped from the stalks ; simmered five minutes. 

Compote of green gooseberries,— Thin is an excellent compote if 
made with fine sugar, and very good with any kind. Break ^ve 
ounces into small lumps and pour on them half a pint of water ; boil 
these gently for ten minutes, and clear off all the soum ; then add to 
them a pint of fresh gooseberries freed from the tops and stalks, 
washed, and well drained. Simmer them gently from eight to ten 
minutes, and serve them hot or cold. Increase the quantity for a 
large dish. ^ 

Compote of green apricots. — Wipe the down from a pound of quite 
young apricots, and stew them very gentiy for nearly twenty minutes 
m syrup made with eight ounces of sugar and three-quarters of a pint 
of water, boiled tos^ether the usual time. 

Compote of red currants. — A quarter of a pint of water and five 
ounces of sugar : ten minutes. One pint of currants freed firom the 



458 MODERN COOJKJSKT. [cHAF. xxjn. 

stalks to be just simmered in the 9}'rup from five to seven minutes. 
This receipt will serve equally for raspberries, or for a compote of 
the two fruits mixed together. Either of them will be found an ad- 
mirable accompaniment to a pudding of batter, custard, bread, or 
ground rice, and also to various other kinds of puddings, as well 
as to whole rice plainly boiled. 

Compote of Kentish or Flemish cherries.— Sunmsr five ounces of 
sugar with half a pint of water for ten minutes; throw into the syrup 
a pound of cherries weighed aller they are stalked, and let them stew 
ffently for twenty mmutes : it is a great improvement to stone the 
fruit, but a larger quantity will then be required for a dish. 

Compete of MoreUa cherries, — ^il together for fifteen minutesi 
six ounces of sugar with half a pint of water; add a pound and a 

Quarter of ripe Morella cherries, and simmer them very softly from 
ve to seven minutes : this is a delicious compote, A larger propor- 
tion of sugar will often be required for it, as the fruit is very aad in 
■ome seasons, and when it is not fully ripe 

Compete of damsons, — Four ounces of sugar and half a pint of 
water to be boiled for ten minutes ; one pound of damsons to be 
added, and simmered gently from ten to twelve minutes. 

Compote of the green magnum-bonum or Mogul plum. — The green 
Mogul plums are often brought abundantly into the market when the 
fruit is thinned from the trees, and they make admirable tarts or 
eompStesy possessing the fine slight bitter flavour of the unripe apricot, 
to which they are quite equal. Measure a pint of the plums without 
their stalks, and wash them very clean; then throw them into a 
syrup made with seven ounces of sugar in lumps, and half a pint of 
water, boiled together for eight or ten minutes. Give the plums one 
quick boil, and then let them stew quite softly for about five minutes, 
or until they are tender, which occasionally will be in less time even. 
Take off the scum, and serve the compote hot or cold. 

Compote of the magnwn-bonum, or other large plums, — ^Boil six 
ounces of sugar with half a pint of water the usual time ; take the 
stalks from a pound of plums, and simmer them very sofUy for 
twenty minutes. Increase the proportion of su^ if needed, and 
re^pilate t^e time as may be necessary for the different varieties of 
fruit. 

Compdte of buUaces.— The large, or shepherds* bullace, is very 
good stewed, but will require a considerable portion of su^ar to 
render it palatable, unless it be quite ripe. Make a syrup with half 
a pound of sugar, and three-quarters of a pint of water, and boil in 
it gently from fifteen to twenty minutes, a pint and a half of the 
bullaoes freed from their stalks. 

Compdte of Siberian cmbs,— To ihree-qvoLrtsn of a pint of water 
add six ounces of fine sugar, boil them for ten or twelve minutes, and 
skim them well. Add a pound and a half of Siberian crabs without 
their stalks, and keep them just at the point of boiling for twenty 
minutes they will then become tender without bniating. A &« 



CHAP, zxiii.] SWEET DISHES AND ENTREMETS. 459 

Stripe of lemon -rind and a little of the juice are sometimes added tc 
this compote. 

Ohi, — In a dry warm summer, when fruit ripens freely, and is rich 
in quality, the proportion of sugar directed for these compotes would 
generally he found sufficient ; hut in a cold or wet season it would 
certainly, in many instances, require to he increased. The present 
slight difference in the cost of sugars, renders it a poor economy to 
use the raw for dishes of this class, instead of that which is well re- 
fined. To make a clear syrup it should he broken into lumps, not 
crushed to powder. Almost every kind of fruit may be converted 
into a good compote. 

comp6te op peaches. 

Fare half a dozen lipe peaches, and stew them very softly from 
eighteen to twenty minutes, keeping them oilen turned in a light 
syrup, made with five ounces of sugar, and half a pint of water boiled 
toother for ten minutes. Dish the fruit ; reduce the syrup by quick 
boding, pour it over the peaches, and serve them hot for a second- 
course dish, or cold for dessert. They should be (^uite ripe, and will 
be found delicious dressed thus. A little lemon-juice may be added 
to the syrup, and the blanched kernels of two or three peach or 
apricot stones. 

Sugar, 5 oz. ; water, \ pint * 10 minutes. Peaches, 6 : 18 to 20 
minutes. 

Obs. — Nectarines, without being pared, may be dressed in the same 
way, but will require to be stewea somewhat longer, unless they be 
quite ripe. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR STEWED PEACHES. 

Should the fruit be not perfectly ripe, throw it into boiling water 
and keep it just simmering, until the skin can be easily stripped off. 
Have r^y half a pound of fine sugar boiled to a light syrup with 
three-quarters of a pint of water ; throw in the peaches, let them 
stew softly until quite tender, and turn them often tnat they ma^ be 
equally done ; aft«r they are dished, add a little strained lemon-juice 
to the syrup, and reduce it by a few minutes* very quick boUing. 
The fruit is sometimes pared, divided, and stoned, then gently stewed 
until it is tender. 

Sugar, 8 oz. ; water, f pint : 10 to 12 minutes. Peaches, 6 or 7 ; 
lemon-juice, 1 laige teaspoonful. 

COMPETE OF BARBERRIES FOR DESSERT. 

When this fruit is first ripe it reG|uire8, from its excessive acidity, 
nearly its weight of sugar to render it palatable; but after hangintf 
some time upon the trees it becomes much mellowed in flavour, and 



460 MODEKN COOKERY [chap. xxiiL 

may be snfficiently sweetened with a smaller dp: portion. According 
to the state of the firuit then, take for each pound (leaving it in 
bunches) from twelve to sixteen ounces of sugar, and boil it with 
three-quarters of a pint of water until it forms a syrup. Throw in 
the bunches of fruit, and simmer them for five or six minutes. II 
their weight of sugar be used, they will become in that time perfectly 
transparent. As all vessels of tin affect the colour of the barberries, 
they should be boiled in a copper stewpan, or in a German enamelled 
one, which would be far better. 

Barberries, 1 lb. ; sugar, 12 to 16 os. ; water, f pint fruit rim- 
mered in syrup, 5 to 6 minutes. 

BLACK CAPS PAR EXCELLENCE. 

(For the Second'Course, or for Destert.) 

Cut a dozen fine Norfolk biffins in two without paring them^ scoop 
out the cores, and fill the cavities with thin strips of fresh lemou'rind 
and with candied orange-peel. Cover the bottom of a flat shallow tin 
with a thick layer of fine pale brown sugar, press the two halves of 
each apple together, and place them closely in the tin ; pour half a 
bottle of raisin or of any other sweet wine over them, and be careful 
to moisten the tops of all ; sift white sugar thickly on them, and set 
the tin into a very hot oven at first, that the outrides of the apples 
may catch or become black ; then draw them to the mouth or the 
oven, and bake them gently until they are soft quite through. The 
Norfolk biflSn answers for this dish far better than any other kind of 
apple, but the winter (jueening, and some few firm sorts beside, can 
be used for it with fair success. These for variety may be cored 
without being divided, and filled with orange marmalade. The blac^ 
caps served hot, as a second-course dish, are excellent. 

Norfolk biffins, 12; rinds fresh lemons, 1 to 2; candied orange- 
rind, 2 to 3 oz. ; pale brown sugar, ] lb. ; raisin or other wine, \ 
bottle ; little sifted sugar } to 1 hour, or more. 

Obs. — The apples dressed as above resemble a rich confection^ and 
will remain good for ten days or a fortnight ; sometimes much longer 
even. The receipt is an admirable one. 

GATEAU DE POMMES. 

Boil together for fifteen minutes a pound of well -refined sugar and 
half a pint of water ; then add a couple of pounds of nonsuches, or of 
any otner finely-flavoured apples which can be boiled earily to a 
smooth pulp, and the juice of^a couple of small, or of one very large 
lemon. Stew these gently until tlie mixture is perfectly free from 
lumps, then boil it quickly, keeping it stirred, without quitting it, 
until .it forms a very thick and dry marmalade. A few minntes 
before it is done add the finely grated rinds of a couple of lemons |

GATEAU OP MIXED FRUITS. (cOOd). 

Extract the juice from some fresh red currants by simmering them 
very gently for a few minutes over a slow fire : strain it through a 
folded muslin, and to one pound of it add a pound and a half of non- 
suches or of freshly gathered codlings, pared, and rather deeply cored, 
that the fibrous part of the apple may be avoided. Boil these quit^ 
slowly imtil the mixture is perfectly smooth, then, to evaporate part 
of the moisture, let the boiling be quickened, lu fx)m twenty-five 
to thirty minutes draw the pan from the fire, and tlirow in gradually 
a pound and a quarter of sugar in fine powder : mix it well with the 
fruit, and when it is dissolved continue the boiling rapidly for twenty 
minutes longer, keeping the mixture constantly stirred ; put it into a 
mould, and store it, when cold, lor winter use, or serve it for dessert, 
or for the second course : in the latter ca^e decorate it with spikes of 
blanched almonds, or pistachio- nuts, and heap solid whipped cream 
round it, or nour a custard into the dish. For dessert it may be 
garnished with dice of the palest apple-jelly. 

Juice of red currants, 1 lb. ; nonsuches, or codlings (pared and 
cored), li lb. ; 25 to 30 minutes. Sucar, l^ lb. : 20 minutes. 

Obs, — A portion of raspberries, if still in season, may be mixed 
with the currants for this gateau^ should the flavour be liked. 

For other and excellent varieties of gateaux of fruit, see Newton 
solid, and damson solid. Chapter XXIV. Ripe peaches and non- 
BQches will likewise do well for it. Codlings answer perfectly for the 
preceding receipt, and the preparation is of fine colour and very 
pleasant flavour : it ought to cut in clear firm slices. Other varieties 
of fruit can be mingled in the same maimer. 



JELLIES. 

calf's feet jelly, (ektbbmets.) 

We hear inexperienced housekeepers frequently complain of the 
difliculty of rendering this jelly perfectly transparent ; but by mixing 
ynth the other ingredients, while quite cold, the whites, and the 
crushed sheUs of a sufficient number of eggs, and allowing the head 
of 8cum which gathers on the jelly to remain undisturbed aft£r it

once forms, they will scarcely fail to obtain it clear. It shoald be 

strained through a thick flannel, or beayer-skin, beg of a conicsi 

form (placed before the fire, should 

the weather be at all cold, or the

it must be strained, again and 

again, until it becomes so ; though 

wc generally find that once sufiices.

fine lemons, the rind of one and a half cut yeiy thin, the whites and 

shells of four large eggs, and half an ounce of i^nglass. Let these 

remain a few minutes off the fire, that the sugar may dissoWe more 

easiljr ; then let the jelly be brought to boil gradually, and do not 

stir It after it begins to heat. When it has boiled gently for sixteen 

minutes, draw it from the fire, and let it stand a short tune before it 

is poured into a jelly-bag, under which a bowl should be placed to 

receive it. When clear and cool, put it into moulds which have been 

laid for some hours in water : these should always be of earthenware 

in preference to metal. If to be served in glasses, or roushed, the 

jelly will be sufiiciently firm without the isinglass, of which, however, 

we recommend a small quantity to be thrown in always when the 

jelly begins to boil, as it facilitates the clearing. 

Calfs feet stock, 2* pints ; sugar, i lb. ; sherry, 1 pint ; juice of 
lemons, 2 large ,- rind of U ; whites and shells of eggs, 4 large, or 5 
small : 16 minutes. 

Obs. 1. — After the jelly has dropped through the bag, an exceed- 
ingly agreeable beverage may be obtained by pouring in some boiling 
water ; from one to three half pints, according to the quantity of jelly 
which has been made. The same plan should be pursued in making 
orange or lemon jelly for an invalid. 

Obs, 2. — As it is essential to the transparency of calFs feet jelly of 
all kinds that the whole of the ingredients should be quite cold when 
they are mixed, and as the stock can only be measured in a liquid 
state, to which it must be reduced by heating, the better plan is, to 
measure it when it is first strained from the feet, and to put apart the 
exact quantity required for a receipt ; but when this has not been 
done, and it is necessary to liquefy it, it must be left until quite cold 
again before it is used. For the maimer of preparing and daiifying 
it, see the beginning of this diapter

and let tliem stew until it is reduced to rather less than two quarts ; 
or if, after the flesh has quite fallen from the bones, the liquor on 
being strained off should exceed that quantity, reduce it by rapid 
boiling in a clean uncovered pan over a ver}- clear fire. When it is 
perfectly firm and cold, take it clear of fat and sediment, and add to 
It a bottle of sherry, which should be of good quality (for poor, thin 
wines are not well adapted to the purpose), three-quarters of a pound 
of sugar broken small, the iuice of five large or of six moderate-sized 
lemons, and the whites, with the shells finely crushed, of seven eggs, 
or of more should they be very small. The rinds of three lemons, 
pared exceedingly thin, may be thrown into the jcll^ a few minutes 
before it is taken from the fire ; or they may be put mto the jelly-bag 
previously to its being poured througn, when they will impart to it a 
slight and delicate flavour, without (kepening its colour much. If it 
is to be moulded, sometlung more than h^f an ounce of isinglass 
should be dropped lightly in where the liquid becomes visible through 
the head of scum, when the mixture begins to boil ; for if not sum- 
dentlv firm, it will break when it is dished. It may be roughed, or 
served jn glasses vrithout this addition ; and in a liquid state will be 
found an admirable ingredient for Oxford, or other punch.

made with good orange or raisin wine, instead of sherry ; to either of 
these the juice of three or four oranges, with a small portion of the

MODERN VARIETIES OP CALF*8 PEET JELLY. 

In modem cookery a number of excellent jellies are made with 
the stock of calves* feet, variously flavoured. Many of them are com- 
pounded entirely without wine, a small quantity of some fine liqueur 
being used as a substitute ; and sometimes cinnamon, or vanilla, or 
Seville orange-rind with a slight portion of acid, takes place of thia 
For aristocratic tables, indeed, it is the present fashion to serve them 
very liditly and d^icately flavoured. Their cost is thus materially 
diminished. Fresh strawberries dropped into clear calf*s feet jelly 
just before it sets, impart a delicious fragrance to it, when they are of 
a choice kind ; and other fruit is mingled with it often ; but none 
has so good an effect, though many sorts when tastefullr employed 
give an excellent appearance to it. The Belfrrave mould, of which 
the description will be found at page 470, is well adapted for highly 
ornameotal jellies ; and we recommend its adoption for this cla^s of 



464 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. xxui. 



APPLB CALP'S FEET JELLY. 

Four a quart of prepared apple-juice (see page 456), on a pound 
of fresh apples pared and cored, and simmer tnem until they are weU 
broken ; strain the juice, and let it stand until cold ; then measure, 
and put a pint and a half of it into a stevrpan with a quart of calfs 
feet stock (see nage 453), nine ounces of sugar broken small, or 
roughly pounded, the juice of two fine lemons, and the thin rinds of 
one and a half, with the wliites and shells of ei^ht eggs. Let it boil 
gently for ten minutes, then strain it through a flannel-bag, and 
when cool put it into moulds. It will be very dear, and firm, and of 
pleasant flavour. Apples of good quality should be used for it, and 
the quantity of sugar must be regulated oy the time of 3'ear, as the 
fruit will have lost much of its acidit}' during the latter part of the 
season. This receipt, which is the result of our own experiment, and 
which we have found very successful, was first tried just after 
Christmas, with pearmains and llipstone pippins. A little syrup of 
preserved ginger, or a small glass of tine white brandy, would, 
perhaps, to some tastes, improve the jelly ; but we give it simply as 
we have had it proved ourselves. 

Prepared apple juice, 1 quart ; fresh apples, 1 lb. : | to } hour. 
Strained juice, 1^ pint ; calfs feet stock, 1 quart ; sugar, 9 oz. ; juice 
of leuious, 2 ; rind of 1 ^ ; whites and shells of eggs, 8 : 10 minutes. 

06*.— We would recommend the substitution of quinces f«r apples 
in this receipt as likely to aflford a very agreeable variety of the 
jelly : or equal portions of the two fruits might answer well. 

Unless the stock be very stifl^ add isinglass to this, as to the calTs 
feet jelly, when it is to be moulded. 



ORAIfGB CALF S FEET JELLY. 

(Author^s Receipt) 

To a pint and a half of firm calfs feet stock, put a pint of strained 
China-orange juice mixe!l with that of one or two lemons ; add to 
these six ounces of sugar, broken small, the very thin rinds of three 
oranges and one lemon, and the whites of six eggs with half the 
shells crushed small. Stir these gently over a clear fire until the 
head of scum begins to form, but not at all afterwards. Simmer the 
jelly for ten minutes from the first /«// boil ; take it from the fire, let 
It stand a little, then pour it through a jelly-bag until perfectly 
clear. This is an original, and entirely new receipt, which we can 
recommend to the reader, the jelly being very pale, beautifully 
transparent, and delicate in flavour : it would, we think, be peculiarly 
acceptable to such invalids as are forbidden to take wine in any 
form. 

The proportions both of sugar and of lemon-juice must be some« 
what varied according to the season in which the oranges are used.

begins to boil will much assist to clear it. When the flavour of 
Seville oranges is liked, two or three can be used with the sweet ones. 

ORANQE ISINQLASS JELLY. 

To render this perfectly transparent the juice of the fruit must he 
filtered, and the isin^^lass clarified ; but it is not usual to take so much 
trouble for it. Strain as clear as possible, first through a sieve or 
muslin, then through a thick cloth or jelly bag, one quart of China 
orange-juice, mixed with as much lemon-juice as will give it an agree- 
able degree of acidity, or with a small proportion of Seville orange- 
juice. ^ Dissolve two ounces and a half of isinglass in a pint of water, 
skim it well, throw in half a pound of sugar, and a few strips of 
the orange-rind, pour in the orange-juice, . stir the whole well 
together, skim it clean without allowing it to boil, strain it through a 
doth or through a muslin, many times folded, and when nearly cold 
put it into the moulds.* This jelly is sometimes made without any 
water, by dissolving the isinglass and sugar in the juice of the fruit.

VERY FINE ORANGE JELLY. 

(Siusex Place Receipt.) 

On two ounces and a half of the finest isinglass, pour a full but an 
exact pint of spring water ; press down the isinglass and turn it over 
until the whole is well moistened ; then place it over a gentle fire and 
let it dissolve gradually ; remove the scum after it has simmered for 
two or three minutes, then pour it out, and set it aside to cool. In 
another pint of spring water boil a pound of highly refined sugar for 
five or SIX minutes ; turn this syrup into a bowl, and when it is only 
iust warm, throw into it the very thinly pared rinds of two fine 
lemons, of two Seville oranges, and of two China oranges, with the 
juice of five China, and of two Seville oranges, and of three lemons. 
When this mixture is cold, but not beginning to thicken, mix it well 
with the liquid isinglass, and strain it through a fine lawn sieve, or 
through a square of muslin folded in four; pour it into moulds 
which have been laid in cold water, and when wanted for the table, 
loosen it from them by wrapping about them, closely, a cloth which has 
been dipped into boiling water, and by passing a knife round the edges. 

Nothing can be more refined and delicate in flavour than the 
above ; but the appearance of the jelly may be improved by clari- 
fying the isinglass, and its colour by boiling the fruit-rinds in the 
syrup for three or four minutes, and by leaving them in it until it is

strained. The oranges and lemons, if good, will yield from two- 
thirds to three-quarters of a pint of juice, and the quantity of jelly 
will be sufficient to fill one large high mould, or two smaller ones 
which contain about a pint and a quarter each. 

When the isinglass is clarified, allow half an ounce more of it ; take 
about a teaspoonful of the white of a frtsh egg, beat it a little, add 
the pint of cold wuter to it, whbk them together for a minute or two^ 
and then pour them on the isinglass; stir it occasionally as it is 
heating, but not after the head of scum is formed : boil it gently for 
two or three minutes, skim, and strain it. The oranges and lemons 
should be dipped into fresh water and wiped dry before they are 
pared ; and snould a muslin strainer (that is to say, a large square of 
common clean muslin) be used for the jelly, it should be laid after 
being washed in the usual manner into plenty of hot water, and then 
into cold, and be well rinsed in, and wrung from each. 

ORANGES FILLED WITH JELLY. 

This is one of the firndful 
dishes which make a pretty 
appearance on a supper table, 
and are acceptable when much 
variety is desired. Take some 
very tine China oranges, and 
with the point of a small 
knife cut out from the top of 
each a round about the sixe of 
a shilling ; then with the 
small end of a tea or an ^g 
spoon, empty them entirely, 
taking great care not to break 
the rmds. Throw these into 
cold water, and make jelly of the juice, which must be well pressed 
from the pulp, and strained as clear as possible. Colour one half a fine 
rose colour with prepared cochineal, and leave the other very pale ; 
when it is nearly cold, drain and wipe the orange rinds, and fill them 
with aJtemate stripes of the two jellies; when thev are perfectly cold 
cut them into quarters, and dispose them tastefully in a dish with a 
few light branches of myrtle between them. Calf s feet or any other 
variety of jelly, or different blanc-manges, may be used at choice to fill 
the rinds ; the colours, however, should contrast as much as possible. 

TO MAKE ORANGE BA6ICETS FOR JELLY. 

The oranges for these should be large. First, mark the handle of 
the basket evenly across the stalk end of the fruit with the back of a 
small knife, or with a silver one, and let it be quite half an inch 
wide; then trace a line across from one end of the handle to the 
other exactly in the middle of the orange, and when the other side 




CHAP. XXIII.] SWEET PIBHESy OB ENTBEMET8. 467 

is marked in the same way, cnt just through the rind with the point 
of a penknife, being careful not to pierce the fruit itself; next, with 
a tea or dessertspoon, take of the quartered rind on either side of the 
handle ; pass a penknife under the handle itself; work the point of a 
spoon gently between the orange and the basket, until they are 
separated in every part ; then taKe the fruit between the thumb and 
fingers, and press it carefully out through one of the spaces on either 
side of the handle. 

Baskets thus made may be filled with any of the jellies of which 
the receipts are given here : but they should be nearly cold before 
they are poured in ; and the^ ought also to be very clear. Some of 
the baskets may be filled with ratifias, and dished alternately with 
those which contain the jelly. 

LEMON calf's feet JELLY. 

Break up a quart of strong cairs feet stock, which should have 
been measured while in a liquid state ; let it be quite clear of fat and 
sediment, for which a small additional quantity should be allowed ; 
add to it a not very full half-pint of strained lemon-juice, and ten 
ounces of suear, broken small (rather more or less according to the 
state of the miit), the rind of one lemon pared as thin as possible, or 
of from two to three when a full flavour of it is liked, and the whites 
with part of the shells crushed small, of five large or of six small 
eggs. Proceed as for the preceding jellies, and when the mixture 
has boiled five minutes throw in a smul pinch of isinglass ; continue 
the boiling for five or six minutes longer, draw the pan from the fire, 
let it stand to settle; then turn it into the jelly-bag. We have 
found it always perfectly clear with once passing through ; but 
should it not be so, pour it in a second time. 

Strong cairs feet stock, 1 quart; strained lemon-juice, short 
I pint ; sugar, 10 oz. (more or less according to state of fruit) ; 
rind of from 1 to 3 large lemons ; whites and part of shells of 5 large 
or 6 small eggs : 5 minutes. Pinch of isinglass : 5 minutes longer. 

Obs. — Ab^ut seven large lemons will produce the half pint of 
juice. This quantity is for one mould only. The jelly will be found 
almost colourless unless much of the rinds be used, and as perfectly 
transparent as clear spring water : it is al^o very agreeable in flavour. 
For variety, part of the juice of the fruit might be omitted, and its 
place supplied by maraschino, or any other rich white liqueur of 
appropriate flavour ; and to render it safer eating, some syrup of 
preserved ginger would be an excellent addition. 

CONSTANTIA JELLY. 

Infuse in a pint of water for five minutes the rind of half a Seville 
oran^ pared extremely thin ; add an ounce of isinglass ; and when 
this IS dissolved thx^w in four ounces of good sugar in lumps ; stir

well, and simmer the whole for a few minutes, then mis with it four 
large wineglassesful of Ck>n8tantia, and strain the jelly through a fine 
doth of close texture ; let it settle and cool, then poiir it gently from 
any sediment there may be, into a mould which has been laid for an 
hour or two into water. We had this jelly made in the first instance 
for an invalid who was forbidden to take acids, and it proved so 
agreeable in flavouf that we can recommend it for the table. The 
isinglass, with an additional quarter of an ounce, might be clarified, 
and the sugar and orange-rind boiled with it afterwa^s. 

Water, 1 pint ; rind, | Seville orange : 5 minutes. Twinglmw,

RHUBARB ISINGLASS JELLT. 

(Auihor*M Original Beceipt. Good.) 

A jelly of beautiful tint, and excellent flavour, may be made with 
fresh young rhubarb-stems, either of the giant or dwarf kind, if they 
be of a bnght pink colour. Wash, and drain or wipe them ; slice 
without paring them, taking them quite free from any coarse or 
discoloured parts. Put two pounds' and a half, and a quart of 
water into an enamelled stewpan, which is more suitable to the 
purpose than any other; throw in two ounces of sugar in lumps, 
and boil the rhubarb very gently for twenty minutes, or until 
it is thoroughly stewed, but not suniciently so to thicken the juice. 
Strain it through a muslin folded in four ; measure a pint and a half 
of it ; heat it afresh in a clean pan ; add an ounce and a half of the 
finest isinglass, and six ounces or more of the best sugar in large 
lumps; stir it of^en until the isinglass is entirely dissolved, then let 
it boil ouickly for a few minutes to throw up the scum ; clear this 
of!' carefully, and strain the jelly twice through a muslin strainer,^ 
folded as the first ; let it cool, and mould it as usual. 

STRAWBERRY ISINGLASS JELLY. 

A great variety of equally elegant and excellent jellies for the 
table may be made with clarified isinglass, clear syrup, and the juice 
of almost any kind of fresh fruit ; but as the process of making them 
is nearly the same for all, we shall limit our receipts to one or two» 
which will serve to direct the makers for the rest. Boil together 
quickly for fifteen minutes one pint of water and three-ouarters of a 
pound of very good sugar ; measure a quart of ripe richly-fiavoured 
strawberries without their stalks ; the scarlet answer best, from the 
tolour which they give : on these pour the boiling syrup, and let 
chem stand all night. The next day clarify two ounces and a half of 
isinglass in a pint of water, as directed at the beginning of this

chapter ; drain the syrup from the strawberries very closely, add to 
it two or three tablespoonsful of red currant juice, and the clear 
juice ol one large or two small lemons y and when the ismglass is 
nearly cold mix the whole, and put it mto moulds. The French, 
who excel in these fruit-jellies, always mix the separate ingredients 
when they are almost cold ; and they also place them over ice lor an 
hour or so after they are moulded, which is* a great advantage, as 
tticy then require less isingiuss, and are in consequence much more 
deliaite. When the fruit abounds, instead of throwing it into the 
syrup, bruise hglitly from three to four pmts, throw two table- 
s|MK>u.sful u( sugar over it, and let the juice flow from it for an hour 
or two ; then pour a little water over, and use the juice without 
boiling, which will give a jelly of finer flavour than the other. 

Water, I pint ; sugar, \ lb. : 15 minutes. Strawberries, 1 quart ; 
isinglass, 2^ oz. ; waier, 1 pint (white of egg, 1 to 2 teaspoonstul) ;

fresh fruit; but one of more recent invention, 
called the Belgrave nundd (which is to be had 
of the originators, Messrs. Temple and Rey- 
nolds, Princes Street, Cavendish Square, and 
also at SO, Motcomb Street, Belgrave Square), 
is of superior construction for tne purpose, as 
it contains a large central cylinder and ax^ 
smaller ones, which when withdrawn, after the 
jelly— which should be poured round, but not 
ittto them— is set, leave vacancies which can be filled either wxUi 
jelly of another colour, or with fruit of different kinds (which must 
be secured in its place with just liquid jelly poured carefully in after 
it is arranged), or with blanc-mange, or any other isinglass-cream. 
The space occupied by the larger cylinder may be left empty, or 
fill^* before the ielly is served, with white or with pale-tint^ 
whipped cream. Water, only sufficiently warm to detach the jeUy 
from them without heating or melting it, must be poured into the 
cylinders to unfix them ; and to loosen the whole so as to unmould 
it easily, a cloth wrung out of very hot water must be wound round 
it, or the mould must be dipped quickly into some which is nearly or 

?iuite coiling. A dish should then be laid on it, it should be care- 
ully reversed, and the mould lifted from it gently. It will some- 
times require a slight sharp blow to detach it quite. 

Italian jelly is made by lydf filling a mould of convenient form, 
and laying round upon it in a chain, as soon as it is set, some blanc- 
mange mi^ rather firm, and cut of equal thickness and size, with a 
small round cutter ; the mould is then filled with the remainder of 
the jelly, which must be nearly cold, but not banning to set. 
Brandied morel la cherries, drained very dr^', are sometimes dropped 
into moulds of pale jelly ; and fruits, either fresh or preserved, are 
arranged in them with exceedingly good effect wnen skilfully 
managed ; but this is best accomplished by having a mould for the 
purpose, with another of smaller size fixed in it by means of slight 
wires, which hook on to the edge of the outer one. By pouring 
water into this it may easily be detached from the jelly ; tiie fruit is 
then to be placed in the space left by it, and the whole filled up with 
more jelly : to give the proper efiect, it must be recollected that ibc 
dish will be reversed when sent to table.

{An Elegant Summer Dish.) 

Throw into a pint of new milk the thin rind of a small lemon, and 
six or eight bitter almonds, blanched and bruised ; or substitute for 
these half a pod of vanilla cut <unall, heat it slowly by the side of the

finest isinglass, or a full ounce should the weather he extremely 
warm; when this is dissolved, strain the milk through a muslin, and 
put it into a clean saucepan, with from four to five ounces and a half 
of sugar in lumps, and half a pint of rich cream ; give the whole one 
boil, and then stir it, briskly and by degrees, to the well-beaten yolks 
of six fresh eggs; next, thicken the mixture as a custard, over a 
gentle fire, but do not hazard its curdling ; when it is of tolerable 
consistence, pour it out, and continue the stirring until it is half cold, 
then mix with it an ounce and a half of candied citron, cut in small 
spikes, and a couple of ounces of dried cherries, and pour it into a 
mould rubbed with a drop of oil : when turned out it will have the 
appearance of a pudding. From two to three ounces of preserved 
ginger, well drained and sliced, may be substituted for the cherries, 
and an ounce of pistachio-nuts, buinched and split, for the citron ; 
these will make an elegant variety of the disdi, and the syrup of the 
ginger, poured round as sauce, will be a further improvement. 
Currants steamed until tender, and candied orange or lemon-rind, are 
often used instead of the cherries, and the wedl-sweetened juice of 
strawberries, raspberries (white or red), apricots, peaches, or syrup of 
pine-apple, will make an agreeable sauce ; a small quantity of this 
last will also give a delicious flavour to the pudding itself, when 
mixed with the other ingredients. Cream may m substituted 
entirely for the milk, when its richness is considered desirable. 

New milk, 1 pint; rind 1 small lemon; bitter almonds, 6 to 8 
(or, vanilla, i pod) ; salt, few grains ; isinglass, ^ oz. (1 oz. in sultry

the syrup as sauce, and 1 oz. of blanched pistachio-nuts ; or 4 oz. 
currants, steamed 20 minutes, and 2 oz. candied orange-rind). For 
sauce, sweetened juice of strawberries, raspberries, or plums, or pine - 
apple syrup. 

Obs,— The currants should be steamed in an earthen cullender, 
placed over a sauce^ian of boiling water, and covered with the lid. 
It will be a great improvement to place the pudding over ice for an 
hour before it is served. •

and let them stew very gently until they are perfectljr tender ; then 
drain them from the water, pound them, while still warm, to a 
smooth paste, and press them through the back of a fine sieve. 
While this is being done, dissolve half an ounce of isinglass in two or 
three spoonsful of water, and put to it as much cream as will, with

Prepare as above, boil and pound, eighteen fine sound chestnuts; 
mix with them gradually, after they have been pressed through a 
fine sieve, half a pint of rich sweet cream ; dissolve in half a pint of 
new milk a hall-ounce of isinglass, then add to them from six to 
eight bitter almonds, blanched and bruised, with two- thirds of the 
rind of a small lemon, cut extremely thin, and two ounces and a 
half of sugar ; let these simmer gently for five minutes, and then 
remain by the side of the fire for awhile. When the milk is strongly 
flavoured, strain it through muslin, prera the whole of it through, 
and stir it by degrees to the chestnuts and cream ; beat the mixture 
smooth, and when it begins to thicken, put it into a mould rubbed 
with oil, or into one which has been aipped in Mrater and shaken 
nearly free of the moisture. If set into a cool place, it will be ready 
for table in six or eight hours. It has a pretty appearance when 
partially stuck with pistachio-nuts, blanched, dried, and cut in 
spikes, their bright green colour rendering them very ornamental to 
dishes of this kind : as they are, however, much more expensive than 
almonds, they can be used more sparingly, or intermingled with 
spikes of the firm outer rind of candied citron.

Ob*. — ^This is a very delicate kind of sweet dish, which we can 
particularly recommend to our readers; it may be rendered more 
reeherchi by a flavouring of maraschino, but must then have a little 
addition of isinglass The preparation, without this last ingredient, 
will be found excellent iced. 

AN EXCELLENT TRIFLE. 

Take equal parts of wine and brandy, about a wineglassfiil of each, 
or two-thirds of good sherry or Madeira, and one of spirit, and 
soak in the mixture four sponge- biscuits, and half a pound of maca- 
roons and ratifias ; cover the bottom of the trifle-dish with part of 
these, and pour upon them a full pint of rich boiled custard made 
with three-quarters of a pint, or rather more, of milk and cream 
taken in equal portions, and six eggs; and sweetened, flavoured 
and thickened by the receipt of page 481 ; lay the remamder of the 
soaked cakes upon it, and pile over the whole, to the depth of two or 
three inches, the whipped syllabub of page 476, previously well 
drained ; then sweeten and flavour slightly with wine only, less than 
half a pint of thin cream (or of cream and milk mixed) ; wash and 
wipe the whisk, and whip it to the lightest possible firoth : take it off 
with a skimmer and heap it gently over the trifle. 

Macaroons and ratifias, \ lb ; wine and brandy mixed, i pint ; rich

(Very Good.) 

Flavour pleasa&tly with lemon rind and cinnamon, a pint of rich 
cream, af\er having taken from it as much as will mix smoothly to 
a thin batter four teaspoonsful of the finest flour ; sweeten it with 
six ounces of wcU-reflned sugar in lumps ; place it over a clear fire 
in a delicately clean saucepan, and when it boils stir in the flour, and 
simmer it for four or five minutes, stirring it gently without ceasing ; 
then pour it out, and when it is quite cold mix with it by degrees 
the strained juice of two moderate-sized and verv fresh lemons, 
'i ake a quarter of a pound of macaroons, cover the bottom of a 
glass dish with a portion of them, pour in a part of the cream, lay 
the remainder of the macaroons upon it, add the rest of the cream, 
and ornament it with candied citron sliced thin. It should be made 
the day before it is wanted for table. The requisite flavour may be 
eiven to this dish by infusing in the cream the very thin riud of a 
lemon, and part of a stick of cinnamon slightly bruised, and then 
straining it before the flour is added ; or, these and the sugar may be 
boiled together with two or three spoonsful of water, to a strongly

flavoured syrnp, which, after having been passed through a mnslin 
strainer, may be stirred into the cream. Some cooks boil the 
cinnamon and the grated rind of a lemon with all the other in- 
^edients, but the cream has then to be pressed through a sieve after 
it is made, a process which it is always desirable to avoid. It may be 
flavoured with vanilla and maraschino, or with orange-blossoms aX

TIPSY CAKE^ OR BRANDT TRIFLE, 

The old-fashioned mode of preparing this dish was to soak a 
light sponge or Savoy cake in as much good French brandy as it 
could absorb ; then, to stick it full of blanched almonds cut into 
whole-length spikes, and to pour a rich cold boiled custard round it. 
It is more usual now to pour white wine over the cake, or a mixture 
of wine and brandy ; with this the juice of half a lemon is sometimes

TERT GOOD LEMON CREAMS MADE WITHOUT CREAM. 

Pour over the very thin rinds of two moderate-sized hut perfectly 
sound fresh lemons and six ounces of sugar, half a pint of spring 
water« and let them remain for six hours : then ado the strained 
juice of the lemons, and five fresh eggs well beaten and also strained; 
take out the lemon-rind, and stir the mixture without ceasing over a 
gentle fire until it has boiled soflly from six to eight minutes : it will 
not curdle as it would did milk supply the place of the water and 
lemon-juice. The creams are, we think, more delicate, though not 
quite so thick, when the yolks only of six eggs are used for them. 
They will keep well for nearly a week in really cold weather. 

Rmds of lemons, 2 : sugar, 6 oz. (or 8 when a very sweet diah is 
preferred) ; cold water, i pint : 6 hours. Juice of lemons, 2 ; eggs, 
5 : to be boiled softly 6 to 8 minutes. • 

Obs, — Lemon creams may, on occasion, be more expeditiously pre- 
pared, by rasping the rind of the fruit upon the sugar which is used 
for them ; or, by paring it thin, and boilmg it for a few minutes with 
the lemon-juice, sugar, and water, before they are stirred to the 

FRUIT CREAMS^ AND ITALIAN CREAMS. 

These are yery quickly and easily made, by mixing with good 
cream a sufficient proportion of the sweetened juice of fresh fruit, or 
of well-made fruit jelly or jam, to flavour it : a few drops of prepared 
cochineal may be added to deepen the colour when it is required for 
any particular purpose. A quarter of a pint of strawberry or of 
raspberry jelly will fully flavour a pint of cream : a very little lemon- 
juice improves almost all compositions of this kind. When jam is 
used it must first be gradually mixed with the cream, and then 
forked through a sieve, to take out the seed or skin of the fruit. 
All fVesh juice, for this purpose, must of course, be cold ; that of 
strawberries is best obtained by crushing the fruit and strewing 
sugar over it. Peaches, pine-apple, apricots, or nectarines, may be 
simmered for a few minutes in a little syrup, and this, drained well 
from them, will serve extremely well to mix with the cream when it 
has become thorou^hl^ cold : the lemon-juice should be added to all 
of these. When the ingredients are well blended, lightly whisk or 
mill them to a froth ; take this ofi* with a skimmer as it rises, and lay 
it upon a fine sieve reversed, to drain, or if it is to be served in 
glasses, fill them with it at once. 

Italian creams are either fruit-flavoured only, or mixed with wine 
like syllabubs, then whisked to a stiff froth and put into a perforated 
mould, into which a muslin is first laid ; or into a small nair-sieve 
(which must also first be lined with the muslih), and left to drain 
until the following day, when the cream must be very gently turned 
out, and disked, and garnished, as fancy may direct

TERT SUPERIOR WHIPPED SYLLABUBS. 

Weigh seTen ounces of fine sugar and rasp on it the rinds of two 
fresh sound lemons of good size, then pound or roll it to powder, and 
put it into a bowl with the strained juice of the lemons, two large 
glasses of sherry, and two of brandy ; when the sugar is dissolved 
add a pint of very fresh cream, and whisk or mill the mixture well ; 
take on the froth as it rises, and put it into glasses. These syllabubs 
will remain good for several days, and should always be made if 
possible, four-and-twenty hours before they are wanted for table. 
The full flavour of the lemon -rind is obtained with less trouble than 
in rasping, b^ paring it very thin indeed, and infiising it for some 
hours m the juice of the fruit 

Sugar, 7 oz. ; rind and juice of lemons, 2 ; sherry, 2 large wine- 
glassesful ; brandy, 2 wineglassesful ; cream, 1 pint. 

Obs^—These proportions are sufficient for two dozens or more of 
syllabubs : they are often made with almost equal quantities of wine 
and creanif but are considered less wholesome without a portion of 
brandy

GOOD COBIMON BLANC-MANGE, OR BLANC-MANGER. 

(Author's Receipt) 

Infuse for an hour in a pint and 
a half of new milk the very thin 
rind of one small, or of half a 
large lemon and four or five 
bitter almonds, blanched and 
bruised,* then add two ounces^ 
of sugar, or rather more for per- 
sons who like the blanc-mange 
very sweet, and an ounce and a 
half of isinglass. Boil them gently Bbunuige or Cke Mould, 

over a clear fire, stirring them often until this last is dissolved ; take 
off the scum, stir in half a pint, or rather more, of rich cream, and 
strain the blanc-mange into a bowl ; it should be moved gently with a 
spoon until nearly cold to prevent the cream from settling on the 
surface. Before it is moulded, mix with it by degrees a wint^lassful 
of brandy.

RICHKR BLANC-MANQB. 

A pint of good cream with a pint of new milk, sweetened and 
flavoured as above (or in any other manner which good taste may 
dictate), with a little additional sugar, and the same proportion of 
isinglass, will make very good blanc- mange. Two ounces of Jordan 
almonds may be pounded and mixed with it, but they are not needed 
with the cream. 

JAUMANOB, OR JAUNE MANOER, SOMETIMES CALLED DUTCH 
FLUMMERY. 

Four on the very thin rind of a large lemon and half a pound of 
sugar broken small, a pint of water, and keep them stirred' over a 
gentle fire until they have simmered for three or four minutes, then 
leave the saucepan by the side of the stove that the syrup may taste 
well of the lemon. In ten or fifteen minutes afterwards aad two 
ounces of isinglass, and stir the mixture oflen until this is dissolved, 
then throw in the strained juice of four sound moderate-sized lemons, 
and a pint of sherry ; mix the whole briskly with the beaten yolks of 
eight fresh eggs, and pass it through a delicately clean hair-sieve : 
next thicken it in a jar or iug plac^ in a pan of boiling water, turn 
it into a bowl, and when it has become cool and been allowed to settle 
for a minute or two, pour it into moulds which have been laid in 
water. Some persons add a small glass of brandy to it, and deduct 
so much from tne quantity of water. 

Rind of 1 lemon ; sugar, 8 oz. ; water, 1 pint : 3 or 4 minutes.

Crush slightly with a silver or wooden spoon, a quart, measured 
without their stalks, of fresh and riclily -flavoured strawberries; 
strew over them eicht ounces of pounded sugar, and let them stand 
for three or four Sours; then turn them on to a fine hair-sieve 
reversed, and rub them through it. Melt over a gentle fire two 
ounces of the best isinglass in a pint of new milk, and sweeten it with 
four ounces of sugar ; strain it through a muslin, and mix it with a 
pint and a quarter of sweet thick cream; keep these stirred until 
they are nearly or quite cold, then pour them gradually to the 
strawberries, whisking them briskly together ; and last of ail throw 
n, by small portions, the strained juice of a fine sound lemon 
Mould the blanc-mange, and set it in a very cool place for twelve 
hours or more before it is served.

Oifs. — We have retained here the old-faahioned name of blanc- 
mange (or blatw-numger) because it is more familiar to many English 
readers than any of recent introduction ; but moulded strawberry- 
cream would be more appropriate ; as uothinff can properly be called 
hiaac manger which is not white. By mingling tne cream, afUr it 
has been whisked, or whipped, to the other ingredients, the prepara^ 
tion becomes what is called tin Fromage SaoaraU^ or Bavanan 
cream, sometimes simply, une Bavaroise. 

QUINCE BLANC-MANGE. 

{Delicious.) 

This, if carefully made, and with ripe quinces, is one of the most 
richly-flavoured preparations of fruit that we have ever tasted ; and 
the receipt, we may venture to say, will be altogether new to the 
reader. Dissolve in a pint of prepared juice of quinces (see page 
456), an ounce of the best isinglass ; next, add ten ounces of sugar, 
roughly pounded, and stir these together gently over a clear lire, 
from twenty to thirty minutes, or until the jmce jellies in falling 
from the spoon. Remove the scum carefully, and pour the boiling 
jelly gradually to half a pint of thick cream, stirring them briskly 
together as they are mixed : they must be stirred until very nearly 
cold, and then poured into a mould which has been rubbed m every 
part with the smallest possible quantity of very pure salad oil, or if 
more convenient, into one that has been dipped into cold water. 

0(«.— This blancman^r which we had made originally on the 
thought of the moment for a friend, proved so very rich in flavour, 
that we inserted the exact receipt for it, as we had had it made on 
our first trial ; but it mieht be simplified by merely boiling the juice, 
sugar, and isinglass, togetner for a few minutes, and then mudng them 
with the cream. An ounce and a half of isinglass and three-quarters 
of a pint of cream might then be used for it. The juice of other 
fruit may be substituted for that of the quinces. 

Juice of quinces, 1 pint ; isinglass, 1 oz. : 5 to 10 minutes. Sugar, 
10 oz. : 20 to 30 minutes. Cream, 4 pint. 

QUINCE BLANC-MANOE, WITH ALMOND CREAM. 

When cream is not procurable, which will sometimes happen in 
the depth of winter, almonds, if plentifully used, will afibrd a very 
good substitute, though the finer blauc- mange is made from the fore* 
going receipt On four ounces of almondis, blanched and beaten to 
the smoothest paste, and moistened in the pounding with a few drops 
of water, to prevent their oiling, pour a pint of boiling quin -juice ;

ends be held and twisted different ways by two persons, to express 
the cream from the almonds ; put the juice again on the fire, with 
half a pound of sugar, and when it boils, throw in nearly an ounce of 
fine isinglass ; simmer the whole for ^ye min^^tes, take off the scum, 
stir the blanc-mange until it is nearly cold, th% mould it for table. 
Increase the quantity both of this and of the preceding blanc-mange, 
when a lai]ge dish of either is required. 

Quince-juice, 1 pint ; Jordan almond, 4 oz. ; sugar, i lb. : isinglass, 
nearly 1 oz, : 5 minutes. 

APRICOT BLANC-MANGE^ OR CRiUE PAUISIENNE. 

Dissolve gently an ounce of fine isinglass in a pint of new milk or 
of thin cream, and strain it through a folded muslin ; put it into a 
dean saucepan, vrith three ounces of sugar, broken into small lumps, 
and when it boils, stir to it half a pint of rich cream ; add it, at first 
by spoonsful only, to eight ounces of the finest apricot jam, mix them 
▼ery smoothly, and stir the whole until it is nearly cold that the jam 
may not sink to the bottom of the mould : a tablespoonful of lemon- 
juice will improve the flavour. 

When cream is scarce, use milk instead, with an additional quarter 
of an oimce of isinglass, and enrich it by poiuring it boiling on the 
same proportion of almonds as for the second quince blanc-mange (see 
page 478). Cream can in all cases be substituted entirely for the 
muk, when a veiy rich preparation is desired. Peach jam will answer 
admirably for this receipt ; but none of any kind should be used for 
it which has not been passed through a sieve when made. 

Isinglass, 1 oz. ; new milk, 1 pint ; cream, i pint : sugar, 3 oz 
apricot jam, \ lb ; lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful. Or, peach jam, ^

CURRANT BLANC-MANOE. 

In three-quarters of a pint of clear currant-juice, drawn from the 
fr&it as for jelly, and strained, dissolve an ounce and a half of isin- 
glass ; add nine oimces of sugar broken small, give the whole a boil, 
strain it, and stir it by slow degrees to three-quarters of a pint of 
thick cold cream ; when it is less than milk-warm pour it into the 
moulds. The proportions of juice and cream can be varied to the 
taste, and a portion of raspberries or strawberries added to the cur- 
rants. BlacK currants would, we think, make an agreeable variety of 
this blanc-mange for persons who like their peculiar flavour, but we 
have not tried them.

LEMON SPONGB| OR MOULDED LEMON CREAM. 

Infuse in half a pint of cream the very thin rind of one large lemon, 
or of one and a half of smaller size ; or, instead of this, rasp the frnit 
with the sugar which is to he used for the preparation. Add three- 
Quarters of an ounce of fine isinglass, and when this is dissolved 
tiirow in seven ounces of sugar in small lumps. Do not boil tbe 
mixture, to reduce it, but let it be kept near the point of simmering, 
until the sugar and isinglass are entimy dissolved, and a full flavour 
of the lemon-rind has been obtained ; then stir in another half- pint 
of cream, and strain the mixture immediately into a deep bowl or pan. 
When it is quite cold, add to it very gradually the strained juice of 
one lemon and a half, whiskin? the preparation well all the time ; 
and when it begins to set, which may be known by its becoming very 
thick, whisk it Tightly to a sponge, pour it into an oiled mould, and, 
to prevent its breaking when it is dished, just dip the mould into hot, 
but not boiling water ; loosen the edges carefully, and turn out the 
cream : to save time and trouble the whisking may be omitted, and a 
plain lemon-cream take place of the sponge.

Obs. — For tfis, as for all other dishes of the kind, a little more or 
less of isinglass may be required according to the state of the weather, 
a larger proportion being needed in summer than in winter. 

AN APPLE HED6E-HOO, OR SUioOISE. 

This dish is formed of apples, pared, cored without being divided, 
and stewed tolerably tender m a light syrup. These are placed in a 
dish, after being well drained, and filled with apricot, or any other 

rich marmalade, and ar- 
ranged in two or more 
layers, so as to give, when 
the whole is complete, the 
form shown in the engrav- 
ing. The number required 
must depend on the size o£ 
the dish. From three to 
five pounds more must be 
stewed down into a smooth and dry marmalade, and with this all the 
spaces between them are to be filled up, arid the whole are to be 
covered with it ; an icing of two eggs, beaten to a verj- solid froth, 
and mixed with two heaped teaspoonsful of sugar, must then be spresid 
evcnlv over the suedoise, tine sugar silled on this, and spikes of 
biancned almonds, cut len«rthwise, stuck over the entire surface; the

in a moment. Pour it into a bowl, and keep it stured until nearly 
cold, then add to it by degrees a wine^lascful of good brandy, and

flayoured with lemon -peel or vanilla, add two ounces of fine sugar, 
and when the whole boils, stir it to five well-beaten eggs which have 
been strained. Put the custard into a jar or jug, set it into a pan of 
boiling water, and stir it without ceasmg until it is thick. Do not 
put it into j^lasses or a dish until it is nearly or quite cold. These, 
as well as all other custards, are infinitely finer when made with the 
yolks only of the eggs, of which the number must then be increased. 
Two ounces of chocolate, a pint of milk, half a pint of cream, two 
or three ounces of su^r, and eight yolks of eggs, will make yeiy 
superior custards of this land.

484 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. zzm. 

mizture, and add tu it half spint of good cream ; let it cool, and then 
flavour it with a few spoonaful of brandy, or a little ratifia ; finish 
and bake it by the directionfl given for the common custard above ; or 
poor it into small well-batteied cups, and bake it very slowly fhim 
ten to twelve minntes. 

FRENCH CUSTARDS OR CREAMS. 

To a quart of new milk allow the yolks of twelve fresh eggs» but 
to equal parts of milk and cream of ten only. From six to eight 
ounces oi sugar will sweeten the custard sufficiently for general 
taste, but more can be added at will; boil this for a few minutes 
gentlv in the milk with a grain or two of salt, and stir the mixture 
briskly to the eggs, as soon as it is taken from the fire. Butter a 
round deep dish, pour in the custard, and place it in a pan of water 
at the point of trailing, taking care that it shall not reach to within 
an inch of the edge ; let it just simmer^ and no more, from an hour 
to an hour and a half: when quite firm in the middle, it will 
be done. A very few live embers should be kept on the lid of 
the stewpan to prevent the steam falling from it mto the custard. 
When none is at hand of a form to allow of this, it is better to use a 
charcoal fire, and to lay an oven-leaf, or tin, over the pan, and the 
embers in the centre. The small French furnace, shown in Chapter 
XXIIL, is exceedingly convenient for preparations of this kind ; and 
there is always more or less of difficulty in keeping a coal fire entirely 
free from smoke for any length of time. Serve the custard cold, 
with chopped macaroons, or ratafias, laid thickly round the edge so 
as to form a border an inch deep. A few petals of fresh orange- 
blossoms infused in the milk will sive it a most agreeable flavour, 
ver^ superior to that derived from Uie distilled water. Half a pod of 
vamlla, cut in short lengths, and well bruised, may be used instead 
of either ; but the milk should then stand some time by the fia« 
before or after it boils, and it must be strained through a muslin 
before it is added to the eggs, as the small seed of the vamlla would 
probably pass through a sieve. 

The French make their custards, which they call cranes^ also in 
small china cups, for each of which they allow one ^g-yolk, and 
then add sufficient milk or cream to nearly fill them ; they sweeten 
and give them a delicate flavour ; and simmer them in a pan of water 
until they are set.

A MERINGUE OF RHUBARB, OR GREEN GOOSEBERRIES. 

Weigh a pound of delicate young rhubarb-stems after they have 
been carefuUy pared and cut into short lengths ; mix eight ounces of 
pounded sugar with them, and stew them gentlv until they form a 
smooth pulp; then qidcken the boiling, and stir them often until they 
are leduoea to a tolerably dry mannalade. When the fruit has 
reached this point turn it from the pan and let it stand until it is 
quite cold. Separate the whites of four fresh egjgs carefully from the 
yolks, and whisk them to a froth sufficiently solid to remain standing 
in points when it is droi>ped from the whisk or fork. Common cooks 
sometimes fail entirely in very light preparations from not prop^ly 
imderstanding this extremely easy process, which requires nothing 
beyond plenty of space in the bowl or basin used, and regular but 
not violent wnisking until the eggs whiten, and graduallv assume the 
appearance of snow. No drop of liquid must remain at the bottom of 
the basin, and the mass must be firm enough to stand up, as has been 
said, in points. When in this state, mingle with it four heaped table- 
spoonsful of dry sifted sugar, stir these gently together, and when 
tney are quite mixed, lay them lightly over the rhubarb in a rather 
deep tart-dish. Place the meringue in a moderate oven and bake it 
for about half an hour, but ascertain, before it is served, that the 
centre is ^uite firm. The crust formed by the white of egg and 
sugar, which is in fact the meringue, should be of a light equal 
brown, and crisp quite through. If placed in an exceedingly slow 
oven, the underpart of it will remain half liquid, and give an unin- 
vitine appearance to the fruit when it is served. Unless the rhubarb 
diould be very acid, six ounces of sugar will be sufficient to sweeten 
it for many tastes. It is a great improvement to this dish to diminish 
the proportion of fruit, and to pour some thick boiled custard upon it 
before tne meringue is laid on. 

0^4. — When gooseberries are substituted for spring-fruit, a pmt 
and a half will be sufficient for this preparation, or even a smaller 
proportion when only one of quite mooerate size is required In the

rhubarb, and rather more sugar must be allowed for them.

prepared it as above, and when it is perfectly cold, but not long before 
It IS sent to table, pour over it about half a pint of rich boiled 
custard also quite cold, then heap on this some well drained, but 
slightly-sweetened whipped cream, which should be good and very 
frnh when it is whisked, but not heavily thick, or it wifl be less eanly 
converted into a snow-froth. The rhubarb will be very nice if served 
with the whipped cream only on it. 

MERINGUE OF PEARS, OR OTHER FRUIT. 

Fill a deep tart-dish nearly to the brim with stewed pears, and let 
them be something more than half covered with their juice. Whisk 
to a solid froth the whites of five eggs ; sdr to them five tablespoonsM 
of dnr sifted sugar, and lay them lightly and equally over the fruit ; 
put the meringue immediately into a moderate oven, and bake it half 
an hour. Cherries, buUaces, and damsons, with various other kinds 
of plimis, first either stewed as for compotes (see page 457), or baked 
witn sugar, as for winter use, answer as well as pears for this dish ; 
which may, likewise, be made of apples, peachy apricots, or common 
plums boiled down quite to a marmalade, with sufficient sugar to 
sweeten them moderately : the skins and stones of these last should be 
remov^, but a few of the blanched kernels may be added to the 
fruit. 

Dish filled with stewed pears or other fruit ; whites of ^gs, 6 ; 
pounded sugar, 5 tablespoonsful : baked, i hour. 

AN APPLE CHARLOTTE, OR CHARLOTTE DE POMMES. 

Butter a plain mould (a round 
or square cake-tin will answer the 
purpose quite well), and line it 
entirely with thiu slices of the 
crumb of a stale loaf, cut so as to 
fit into it with ^reat exactness, axtd 
dipped into clarified butter. When 
this is done, fill the mould to the 
brim with apple marmalade; cover 
the top with slices of bread dipped m butter, and on these place a 
dish, a large plate, or the cover of a French stewpan with a weight 
upon it. Send the Charlotte to a brisk oven for three quarters of an 
hour should it be small, and for an hour if large. Turn it out with 
great care, and serve it hot If baked in a slack oven it will not take 




OHAP. zxizlJ BWBBT pishes. 487 

a proper degree of colour, and it will be liable to break in the 
di^ng. The strips of bread must of course join very perfectly, for 
if any spaces were left between them the syrap of the fruit would 
escape and destroy the good appearance of the dish : should there not 
haye been sufficient marmalade prepared to fill the mould entirely, a 
jar of quince or apricot jam, or of preseryed cherries eyen, mav be 
added to it with adyantase. The butter should be well drained from 
the Charlotte before it is taken from the mould; and sugar may be 
sifred thickly oyer it before it is served, or it may be covered with 
any kind of dear red jelly. 

A more elegant, and we think an easier mode of forming the crust, 
is to line the mould with small rounds of bread stamped out with a 
plain cake or paste cutter, then dipped in butter, and placed with the 
edges sufficiently one over the other to hold the fruit securely : the 
stnps of bread are sometimes arranged in the same way. 

f to 1 hour, quick oven. 

MARMALADE FOR THE CHARLOTTtE. 

Weigh three pounds of good boiling apples, after they have been 
pared, cored, and quartered; put them mto a stewpan with six 
ounces of fr^ butter, three quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to 
powder, three quarters of a teaspoonf^il of^ pounded cinnamon, and 
the strained juice of a lemon ; let these stew over a eentle fire, until 
liiey form a perfectly smooth and dry marmalade ; keep them often 
stiiTed that they may not bum, and let them cool berore they are 
pat into the crust This quantity is for a moderate-sized Charlotte. 

A CHARLOTTE A LA PARISIENNE. 

This dish is sometimes called in England a Yienna cake ; and it 
is known here also, we believe, as a Oateaux de Bordeaux, Cut 
horizontally into half-inch slices a Savoy or sponge cake, and cover 
each slice with a different kind of preserve ; replace them in their 
original form, and spread eoually over the cake an icing made with 
the whites of three ^[gs, and four ounces of the finest pounded sugar ; 
sift more sugar over it in every part, and put it into a very gentle 
oven to dry. Ihe eggs should be whisked to snow before they are 
used. One kind of preserve, instead of several, can be used for this 
dish; and a rice or a pound cake may supply the place of the 
Savoy or sponge biscuit. 

A GEBTRin>B A LA CREMB. 

Slice a plain pound or rice cake as for the Charlotte d la Pariiiewne^ 
and take a round out of the centre of each slice with a tin-cutter 
before the preserve is laid on ; replace the whole in its original form, ice 
the outside with a green or rose coloured idng at pleasure, and dry

(^Buttered apples. Excellent) 

Fare six or ei^ht fine apples of a firm but {pood boiling kind, and 
eore without piercing them through, or dividing them; fill the 
cavities with fresh butter, put a quarter of a pound more, cut small, 
into a stewpan just larse enoneh to contain the apples in a single 
layer, place them closely top;ether on it, and stew tnem as softly as 
poesihle^ turning them occasionally until they are almost suffidentlv 
tender to serve ; then strew upon them as much sifted sugar as wiU 
•weeten the dish highly, and a teaspoonful of ]^unded cinnamon; 
shake these well in and upon the fnut, and stew it for a few minutes 
longer. Lift it out, arrange it in a hot dish, put into each apple as 
much warm apricot jam as it vdll contain, and lay « small quantity 
on the top; pour the syrup from the pan round, but not on tM 
fruit, and serve it immediately. 

Apples, 6 to 8; fVesh butter, 4 oz., just simmered till tender. 
Sugar, 6 to 8 oz.; cinnamon, 1 teaspoonAil: 5 minutes. Aprioot 
jam as needed. 

Obe. — Particular care must be taken to keep the ai)ples entire: 
they should rather steam in a gentle heat than boiL It is impossiUe 
to specify the precise time which will render them sufficiently tender, 
as tnis must depend greaUy on the time of year and the sort of froit 
If the stewpan were placed in a very slow oven, the more regular 
heat of it would perhaps be better in its effect than the stewing. 

SuiDOISB OF PEACHES. 

Fare and divide four fine, ripe peaches, and let them jtut nnaur 
from five to eight minutes in a syrup made with the third of a pint 

of water and three ounces 
of very white sugar, boiled 
tQffether for fifteen minutes ; 
lift Uiem out carefully into 
a deep dish, and pour about 
half the syrup over them, 
_ and into the remaining half 

more of qmte npe peaches, 
and boil them to a perfectly smooth dry pulp or marmalade, with 
as much additional sugar in fine powder, as the nature of the fruit 
may require. Lift the other peaches from the syrup, and reduce il

by yery quick boiling, more than half. Spread a detp layer of the 
xnarmalaae in a dish, arrange the peaches symmetrically round it, 
and fill all the spaces between them with the marmalade ; place the 
half of a blanched peach-kernel in each, pour the reduced syrup 
equally over the surface, and form a border round the dish with 
Italian macaroons, or, in lieu of these, with candied citron, sliced 
very thin, and cut into leaves with a small paste-cutter. A little 
lemon-juice brin&;s out the flavour of all nreparations of peaches, 
and may be added with good effect to this. W hen the fruit is scarce, 
the marmalade (which ought to be very white) may be made in 
part, or entirely, with nonsuches. The better to preserve their fomu 
the peaches are sometimes merely wiped^ and then boiled tolerabl^^ 
tender in the syrup before they are pared or split Half a pint of 
water, and from five to six ounces of sugar must then be allowed {or 
them. If any of those used for the marmalade should not be quite 
ripe, it will be better to pass it through a sieve, when partially done, 
to prevent its being lumpy. 

Large ripe peaches, pared and halved, 4 : simmered in syrup, 5 to 
8 minutes. Marmalade : peaches (or nonsuches^ 2 lbs. ; sugar, ^ to

Peaches, if boiled whole in syrup, 15 to 18 minutes. 

O^. — The number of peaches can, at pleasure, be increased to six, 
and three or four of the halves can be piled above the others in the 
centre of the dish. 

AROCB DOCB (OB SWEET BICE, A LA PDBTUGAISE.) 

Wash thoroughly, then drain, and wipe dry in a soft clcfth, half a 
pound of the best Carolina rice. Four to it three pints of new milk, 
and when it has gently stewed for half an hour, add eight ounces of 
sugar broken into small lumps, let it boil until it is drv and tender, 
and when it is nearly so, stir to it two ounces of blanched almonds, 
chopped* or pounded. Turn the rice when done into shallow dishes 
or soup plates, and shake it until the surface is smooth ; then sift 
over It rather thickly through a muslin, some freshly-powdered 
cinnamon, which will give it the appearance of a bak^ pudding. 
Serve it cold. It will remain ^ood for several days. This is quite 
the best sweet preparation of nee that we have ever eaten, and it is 
a very favourite dish in Portugal, whence the receipt was derived. 
One or two bitter almonds, pounded with the sweet ones, might a 
little improve its flavour, ana a few spoonsftd of rich cream could 
occasionally be substituted for a small portion of the milk, but it 
should not be added until the preparation is three parts done. 

Hice, 8 oz. ,* milk, 8 pints : 30 minutes. Sugar, 8 oz. : 1 hour or 
more. Pounded almonds, 2 oz, ; cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful.

the entire quantity of milk at first, as from a quarter to half a pint 
less will sometimes proYe sufficient. The grain should be thoxx>ughl/ 
tender, but dry and unbroken. 

cocoA-mrT i>oce. 

This is merely fine fresh lightly grated cocoa-nut stewed until 
tender in syrup, made with one pound of sugar to half a pint of 
water (or more to the taste) and flavoured with orange-flower 
water. 

BUTTERED CHERRIES. (CERISBS AU BEURRE.) 

Cut four ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf into dice, and fity 
ihem a light brown in an ounce and a half of fresh butter ; take 
them up, pour the butter from the pan, and put in another ounce 
and a hall ; to this add a pound of Kentish cherries without their 
stdlks, and when they are quite warmed through, strew in amongst 
them four ounces of sugar, and keep the whole well turned over a 
moderate fire ; pour in graduallv half a pint of hot water, and in 
fifteen minutes the cherries will be tender Lay the fried bread 
into a hot dish, pour the cherries on it, and serve tnem directly. 

Bread, 4 oz.; butter, Ih oz. Cherries, 1 lb.; butter, H oz.: 10 
minutes. Sugar, 4 oz. ; water, \ pint : 15 minutes. 

Obs. — ^Black-heart cherries may be used for this dish instead of 
Kentish ones : it is an improvement to stone the fruit. We think our 
readers generally would prefer to the above Morella cherries stewed 
from five to seven minutes, in syrup (made by boiling five ounces of 
sugar in half pint of water, for a quarter of an hour), and poured 
hot on the fried bread. Two pounds of the fruit, when it is atoned, 
will be required for a fW-sized dislu 

BVnSBT MACAROia. 

Drop gently into a pint and a half of new milk, when it is boilimr 
fast, four ounces of fine pipe macaroni, add a grain or two of salt, and 
some thin strips of lemon or orange rind : cinnamon can be sub- 
stituted for these when preferred. Simmer the macaroni by a gentle 
flre until it is tolerably tender, then add tcom two to three ounces 
of sugar broken small, and boil it till the pipes are soft, and 
swollen to their toll size ; drain, and arrange it in a hot dish ; stir 
the milk quickly to the well-beaten volks of three large, or of 
four small eggs, shake them round briskly over the fire until they 
thicken, pour them over the macaroni and serve it immediately ; or 
instead of the eggs, heat and sweeten some very rich cream, pour it 
on the Irained macaroni, and dust finely-powdered cinnamon over

light froth. 

New milk, 1| pint ; pipe macaroni, 4 oz. ; strips of lemon-rind or 
dimamon ; sngar, 2 to 8 oz. : } to 1 hour, or more. 

BERMUDA WITCHES. 

^ Slice equally some rice, pound, or Sayoy cake, not more than the 
sixth of an incn thick ; take o£f the hrown edges, and spread one hsdf 
of it with Guaya jelly, or, if more conyenient, with fine strawherry, 
raspberry, or currant jelly of the best quality (see Korman receipt, 
478) ; on this strew thickly some fresh cocoa-nut grated small and 
lightly ; press oyer it the remainder of the oake, and trim tiie whole 
Into good form ; divide the slices if large, pile them slopingly in the 
centre of a dish upon a very white napkin folded flat, and garnish or 
intersperse them with small sprigs of myrtle. For very young 
people a Frencii roU or two, and good currant jelly, red or white, 
will supply a wholesome and inexpensiye dish. 

IVESSELRODE PUDDING. 

We ^ye Monsieur Car^me*s own receipt for this favourite and 
fashionable dish, not having ourselves had a j^ood opportunity of 
proving it; but as it ori^ated with him he is the beat authority 
for it. It may be varied m many ways, which the taste or iDgenuity ' 
of the reader will easily suggest. Boil forty fine sound Spanish 
chestnuts quite tender in plenty of water, take off the husks, and 
pound the chestnuts j^erfectly with a few spoonsful of syrup ; rub 
them through a fine sieve, and mix them in a basin with a pint of 
syrup made with a pound of su^ar clarified, and highly-flavoured 
with a pod of vanilla, a pint of rich cream, and the yolks of twelve 
eggs ; tnicken the mixture like a boiled custard ; when it is cold put 
it mU> a freezing pot, adding a glass of maraschino, and make it set as 
an iced cream ; then add an ounce of preservol citron cut in dice, two 
ounces of currants, and as many fine raisins stoned and divided (all 
of which should be soaked from the day before in some maraschmo 
with a little sugar); the whole thus mingled, add a plateful of 
whipped cream, and the whites of three eggs prepared as for Italian 
menngue. When the pudding is perfecuy frozen, mould it in a 
pewter mould of the form of a pine-apple, and phu^ it again in the 
m till wanted to serve. Preserved cherries may be sub^tuted for 
the raisins and currants. 

Chestnuts, 40; syrup, 1 pint some spoonsftil; vanilla, 1 pod; 
cream, 1 pint ; yolk of eggs, 12 ; maraschino, 1 glassful ; citron, 1 oz. ; 
cnrrants, 2 oz. ; raisins, 2 oz. ; whipped cream, 1 plateful ; whites of 
eggs beaten to snow, 3. 

Obi'—As Monsieur Car^me directs the eggs for his Italian me- 



492 MQDEBN GOOKEBT. [csap. zzm. 

riugnes to be pre])ared as follows, he probably intends that they 
should be mizea with the syrup before they are added to the puddb]^. 
Boil together half a pound of the finest sugar, and half a pint of 
water, until they begin to be very thick; then, with a wooden spoon,, 
work the sugar against the side of the pan till it whitens; leave it to 
cool a little, work it again, and then with a whisk mingle with it the 
eggs whipped to a very firm froth, which ought to prince a prepa- 
ration veiy white, smooth, and brilliant. 

STEWED FI08. (a. VERY NICE COMPOTE.) 

Put into an enamelled or a copper stewnan, four ounces of refined 
suear, the very thin rind of a larjs;e and fresh lemon, and a pint of 
com water. When the sugar is dusolved, add a pound of fine Turk^ 
figs, and place the stewpan on a trivet above a moderate fire, or upon 
a stove, where they can neat and swell slowly, and be very gently 
stewed. Wben they are quite tender, add to them two glaasesful of 
port wine, and the stramed juice of the lemon ; arrange them in a 
glass dish, and serve them cold. From two hours to two and a half 
of the gentlest stewing will geoerallv be sufficient to render the figs 
fit for table. Orange-juice and rind can be used for them at pleasure, 
instead of the lemon ; two or three bitter almonds may be twiled is 
the svrup to give it flavour, and any wine can be used for it whicn 
may be preferred, but port is best. 

This comp6tti may be served in the second course hot, in a xioe* 
border ; or cold for dessert.

GENERAL REMARKS ON. THE USE AND YALVB OF PRESBRYED 
FRUIT. 

Simple well-made preserves— esrpecially those of our early summer 
fruits — are most valuable domestic stores, as they will retain through 
the entire year or longer,* their peculiarly grateAil and agreeable 
flavour, and supply many wholesome and refreshing varieties of diet 
through the winter months and spring. They are, indeed, as con- 
ducive to health — ^when not doyingly sweet or taken in excess— as 
good v^etables are ; and they are inexpensive luxuries (if as luxuries 
they must be regarded), now sugar is so very reasonable in price. 
By many families they are considered too much as mere superfluities 
of the table, and when served only— as they so often are— combined 
with rich pastry-crust or cream, or converted into ices and other 
costly preparations, may justly be viewed solely in that light. To 

* We have had them txetOmt at the end of three or four jears, bnt they were 
made firom the produce of a home garden, as freshly gathered, and careftilly 
•elected as it could be. Some clear apricot-marmalade, some strawbenr-jelly, 
and some raspberry-jelly, "were amongst those "which retained their fall nayonr 
and transparency to the last They "were merely coyered "with two layers of thin 
writing paper pr onc d closelsy on them, after being saturated with spirits of wins. 



494 MODEBK COOKERY. [cbap. zzrr. 

be eaten in perfection they should be sufficiently boiled down to 
remain firee fix)m mould or fermentation, and yet not so much 
reduced as to be dry or hard ; they should not afterwards be sub- 
jected to the heat of the oven,* but served with some plain pudding, 
or light dish of bread, rice, ribbon-macaroni, soujee, semomina, 9^ 
When intended for tartlets or creams, or fruit-sauces, for which see 
Chapter XX., they should be somewhat less boiled, and be made 
with a larger proportion of sugar. 

Fruit steamed in bottles is now vended and consumed in very 
large quautities in this country, but it is not wholesome, as it pro- 
duces often — ^probably from the amount of fixed air which it contains 
— violent derangement of the system. When the bottles are filled 
with water it is less apt to disagree with the eaters, but it is never so 
really wholesome as preserves which are made with sugar. That 
which is baked keeps remarkably well, and appears to be somewhat 
less objectionable than that which is steamed. 

The rich confectiomury preparations called wet preserves (fruits 
preserved in syrup), wnicn are principally adapted to formal dessorts, 
scarcely repay the cost and trouble of making them in private 
families, unless they be often required for table. They are in 
general lusciously sweet, as they will only remain good with a large 
proportion of sugar ; and if there be no favourable place of storage 
for them they soon spoil. When drained and well ^ed, they may 
much more easily be kept uninjured. The general directions for 
them, which we append, and the receipts for dried gooseberries, 
cherries, and apricots which we have inserted here will be sufficient 
for the guidance of the reader who may wish to attempt them.

The small portable French stoye, or furnace, shown In the preceding 
page, with the trivet and stewpan adapted to it, is ezce^lingly con- 
Tenient for all preparations which require either more than usual atten- 
tion, or a fire entirely free from smoke ; as it can be placed on a table in 
a clear light, and the heat can be regulated at pleasure. It has been 
used for many of the preserves of which the receipts are eiyen in this 
chapter, as well as for various dishes contained m the body of the 
wonc. There should always be a free current of air in the room in 
which it stands when lighted, as charcoal or braise (that is to say, the 
live embers of large well-burned wood, drawn from an oven and 
shut inmiediately into a closely- 
stopped iron or copper vessel to * 
extmguish them) is the only iuel 
suited to it. To kindle either of 
these, two or three bits must be 
lighted in a common fire, and laid 
on the top of that in the furnace, 
which should be evenly placed be- 
tween the gratinff and the brim, and 
then blown gently with the bellows 
until the whole is alight : the door 
of the furnace must in the mean 
while be open, and remain so, unless 
the heat should at any time be too 
fierce for the preserves, when it must 
be closed for a few minutes, to 
moderate it. To extinguish the fire 
altogether, the cover must be pressed 
closely on, and the door be quite 
shut : the embers which remain will 
serve to rekindle it easily, but before 
it is again lighted the grating must 
be lift^ out and all the ashes cleared [ 
away. It should be set by in a place 
which is not damp. In a common 
grate a clear fire for preserving may r-

be made with coke, which is a degree 

less unwholesome than charcoal iVevet. 

The enamelled stewpans which have now come into general use, 
are, from the peculiar nicety of the composition with which tJiey are 
lined, better adapted than any others to pickling and preserving, as 
ihev may be used without danger for acids ; and red fruits when 
boiled in them retain the brightness of their colour as well as if 
copper or bell-metal were us^ for them. The form of the old- 
fashioned preserving-pan, made usually of one or the other of these, 
is shown nere ; but it has not, we should say, even the advantage 
of being of convenient shape; for tJ^e handles quickly be- 
come heated, and the pan, in consequence, cannot always be

instantaneously raised from the ore when the contents threaten to 
OTer-boil or to bum. 

It is desirable to hare three or four wooden spoons or spatulas, 
one fine hair-sieve, at the least, one or two large squares of common 
muslin, and one strainer or more of closer 
y texture, kept exclusiTely for prepaia 
tions of frmt; for if used for other -pui 
poses, there is the haasard, without great 
care, of their retaining some strong or 
coarse flavour, which they would im« . 
part to the preserves. A sieve, for 
example, used habitually for soup or 
Copper PKflenring Pan. gravy, should never, on any accowU^ be 
brought into use for any kind of confectionaiy, nor in making 
sweet dishes, nor for straining eggs or milk for puddings, cakes, 
or bread. Damp is the great enemy, not only of preserves and 
|>ickl^ but of numberless other household stores ; yet, in many 
situations, it is extremely difficult to exclude it To keep them 
in a "rff7 cool place'*' (words which occur so frequently both in 
this book, and in most others on the same subject), is more easOy 
directed than done. They remain, we find, more entirely free 
from any danger of moulding, when covered with a brandied paper 
only, and placed on the shelves of a tolerably dry store-room, or in a 
chiffoneer (in which we have had them keep unchanged for years). 
When the slightest fermentation is perceptible in syrup, it should 
immediately be boiled for some minutes, and well skimmed ; the fruit 
taken ftt)m it should then be thrown in, and well scalded also, and 
the whole, when done, should be turned into a very clean dry jar : 
this kind of preserve should always be covered with one or two skinsy 
or with parchment and ^ck paper when it is not secured frx>m the 
air with corks. 



A FEW GENERAL BULBS AND DIRECTIONS FOR PRESERVING. 

1. Let eveiythinff used for the purpose be delicately clean and 
dry ; bottles especia&y so. 

2. Never place a preserving pan flat upon the flrCy as this will 
render the preserve liable to Imm to, as it is called ; that is to say, to 
adhere closely to the metal, and then to bum ; it should rest always 
on a trivet (that shown with the French furnace is veiy conveniai\ 
even for a common grate), or on the lowered bar of a kitchen range 
when there is no regular preserving stove in a house. 

3. After the sugar is added to them, stir the preserves gently at 
first, and more quickly towards the end, without quitting them until 
they are done : this precaution will always prevent the chance of 
khcir being spoiled. 

4. All preserves should be perfectly cleared from the scum as it rises. 
6. Frmt which is to be preserved in syrup must first be blanched 



CHAP. ZXIY.] PBESEBYES. 497 

or boiled gently, until it is sufficiently softened to absorb the sugar ; 
and a thin syrujp must be poured on it at first, or it ^viil shrivel 
instead of remainmg plump, and becoming clear. Thus, if its weight 
of sugar is to be allowed, and boiled to a syrup with a pint of water 
to the pound, only half the weight must be taken at first, and this 
must not be boiled with the water more than fifteen or twenty 
minutes at the commencement of the process ; a part of the remain- 
ing sugar must be added every time tne syrup is reboiled, unless it 
should be otherwise directed in the receipt. 

6. To preserve both the true^ flavour and the colour of fruit in 
jams and jellies, boil them rapidly until they are well reduced, hefore 

'the sugar is added, and quickly afterwards, but do not allow them to 
become so much thickened that the sugar will not dissolve in them 
ea^y, and throw up its scum. In some seasons, the juice is so much 
richer than in others, that this effect takes place almost before one is 
aware of it ; but the drop which adheres to the skinuner when it is 
lield up, will show the state it has reached. 

7. Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers, for pre- 
serves, as they will convert the colour of red fruit into a dmgy 
purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavour. 

8. When cheap jams or jellies are required, make them at once 
with Lisbon sugar, but use that which is weU refined always, for 
preserves in general; it is a false economy, as we have elsewhere 
observed, to purchase an inferior kind, as there is great waste from it 
in tiie quantit]r of scum which it throws up. The heit has been used 
for all the receipts given here. 

9. Let fruit for preserving be gathered always in perfectly dry 
weather, and be free both from the mominff and evening dew, and as 
much so as possible from dust. When botued, it must be steamed or 
baked during the day on which it is gathered, or there will be a ^preat 
loss from the burstmg of the bottles ; and for jams and jeUies it 
cannot be too soon boiled down alter it is taken from the trees. 

TO BXTRAOT THB JUICE OF PLUMS FOR JFXLT. 

Take the stalks from the fruit, and throw aside all that is not 
perfectly sound : put it into very dean, lar^e stone jars, and give 
part of the harder kinds, such as buUaces and damson, a gash with a 
uife as they are thrown in ; do this especially in filhng the upper 
part of the jars. Tie one or two folds of thick paper over them, and 
set them for the night into an oven from whicn the bread has been 
drawn four or five hours ; or cover them with bladder, instead of 
paper, place them in pans, or in a copper* with water which will reach 
to quite two-thirds of their height, and boil them gently from two to 
three hours, or until the fruit is quite soft, and has yielded all the 
juice it will afford : this last is the safer and better mode for jellies of 
delicate colour.

TO WEIGH THE JUICE OP FEUIT. 

Fat a basin into one flcale, and its weight into the other ; add to 
this last the weight which is required of the juice, and pour into the 
basin as much as will balance the scales. It is always better to weigh 
Uian to measure the juice for preserving, as it can generally be dcme 
with more exactness. 

RHUBARB JAM. 

The stalks of the rhubarb (or spring-fruit, as it is called) should 
be taken for this preserve, which is a very good and useful one, while 
they are fresh and young. Wipe them veiy clean, pare them 
quickly, weieh, and cut them into half-inch lengths; to eveir pound 
add an equu weight of good sugar in fine powder ; mix them wdl 
together, let them renudn for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to 
draw out the iuice a little, then turn them into a preserving pan, kt 
them heat rather slowly, but as soon as the stalks are tender boil the 
preserve rapidly, stirring it well for about half an hour. It will be 
of excellent flavour, and will serve admirabl v for tarts. 

A somewhat cheaper mode of making the jam is to stew it untH 
tender in its own juices, and then to boil it rapidly until it is tolerably 
dry, to add to it only half its weight of sugar, and to give it from 
twent]^ to thirty minutes boiling. 

Spring fruit (rhubarb), 4 lbs. ; sugar, 4 lbs. : heated slowly, and 
when tender, boiled quickly, 30 minutes. 

GREEN GOOSEBERRY JELLT. 

Wash some freshly gathered gooseberries very dean ; after havii^ 
taken off the tops and stalks, then to each poimd pour tluree-quarters 
of a pint of spring water, and simmer them until they are well 
broken ; turn the whole into a jellv-bag or cloth, and let all the 
juice drain through ; weigh and boil it rapidlv for fifteen minutes. 
JDraw it from the fire, and stir in it until entirely dissolved, dai equal 
weight of good susar reduced to powder ; boil the jelly from fifteen 
to twenty minutes longer, or until it jellies strongly on the spoon or 
skinmier ; clear it perfectlv from scum, and pour it into small jars, 
moulds, or glasses. It ought to be very pale and transparent. The 
sugar may be added to the juice at first, and the preserve boiled from 
twenty-five to thirty-five minutes, but the colour will not then be so 
good. When the fruit abounds, the juice may be drawn from it with 
very Httle water, as directed for apples, page 523, when it will 
require much less boiling. 

Gooseberries, 6 lbs.; water, 4 pints: 20 to 30 minutes. Juioe 
boiled quickly, 15 jninutes ; to each pound, I pound sugar : 15 to 
20 minutes

OBEEN OOOSEBBRBT JAM. 
(Firm and cfgood colour.) 

Cut the stalks and tops from the fruit, weigh and braise it slightly, 
boil it for six or seyen minutes, keeping it well turned during the 
time, then to every three pounds of gooseberries add two and a half 
of sugar beaten to powder, and boil tne preserre quickly for three- 
qoarters of an hour. It must be constantly stirred, and carefully 
cleared from scum. This makes a fine, firm, and refreshing preserve 
i£ the fruit be rubbed through a sieve before the sugar is added. If 
well reduced afterwards, it may be converted into a gateau^ or 
gooseberry-solid, with three pounds of sugar, or even a smaller pro- 
portion. The preceding jam will often turn in perfect form from the 
moulds or jars which contain it; and if freed from tiie seeds, would 
be very excellent : it is extremely ^ood even made as above. For 
all preserves, the reducHoti, or boilmg down to a certain consistence, 
should take place principally before the sugar is mingled with them ;. 
snd this has the best effect when add^ to the fruit and dissolved in. 
it by degrees. 

Green gooseberries, 6 lbs.* 6 to 7 minutes. Sugar, 6 lbs.; f 
hour. 

TO I>BT OBBEN G008EBBBRIBS. 

Take the finest green gooseberries, fhlly grown, and freshly 
gathered ; cut off the buds, split them across the tops half way down, 
and with the small end of a tea or of an egg spoon, scoop out the 
seeds. BoU together for fifteen minutes a pound and a half of the 
finest sugar, and a pint of water ; skim this syrup thoroughly and 
throw into it a pound of the seeded gooseberries ; sunmer them fit>m 
five to seven mmutes, when they ought to be clear and tender ; when 
they' are so, lift them out, and throw as many more into die syrup ; 
dram them a Uttle when done, spread them singly on dishes, and dry 
tiiem very gradually in a quite cool stove or oven, or in a sunny 
window. Tnev will keep well in the syrup, and may be potted in 
it, and dried when wanted for use. 

Green gooseberries without seeds, 2 lbs. ; water, 1 pint ; sugar, 1^ 
lb. : boil^ 15 minutes. Gooseberries simmered, 5 to 7 minutes. 

GREEN GOOSEBERBIES FOR TARTS. 

FOl very dean, dry, wide-necked bottles with gooseberries gathered 
the same day, and before they have attained their Ml growth. 
€k>rk them Ughtly, wrap a little hay roimd each of them, and set 
them up to their necks m a copper of cold water which should be 
brought yexy gradually to boil. Let the fruit be gently simmered 



600 MODERN COOKERr. Lchap.XZXT. 

until it appears shrunken and perfectly scalded ; tben take out the 
bottles, and with the contents of one or two fill up the remainder, and 
use great care not to break the fruit in doing this. When all are 
ready pour scalding water into the bottles and cover the gooseberries 
entirely with it, or they vill become mouldy at the top. Cork the 
bottles well immediately, and cover the necks with melted resin; 
keep them in a cool place ; and when the goosebeiries are used 
pour off the greater part of the water, and add sugar as for the fresh 
Iruit, of which they will have the flavour and appearance ; and the^ 
will be found more wholesome prepared in this manner than if 
■imply baked or steamed in the bottles. 

RED GOOSEBEBRT JAM. 

The small rou|[h red goosebeny, when fully ripe, is the best for 
this preserve, which may, however, be made of the larger kinds. 
When the tops and stalks have been taken carefully from the fruft, 
weiffh, and boil it quickly for three-quarters of an hour, keeping it 
well stirred ; then for six pounds of the gooseberries, add two aid a 
half of good roughly-powdered sugar ; lx>il these tq^ether briskhr, 
from twenty to twenty-five minutes and stir the jam well from the 
bottom of the pan, as it is liable to bum if this be n^lected. 

Small red gooseberries, 6 lbs. : } hour. Founded sugar, 2^ lbs. : 
20 to 26 minutes. 



TERT FINE G008EBBRRT JAM. 

Seed the frvdU which for this jam may be of the larger kind of 
rough r^ gooseberry : those which are smooth skinned are generally 
of fir inferior flavour. Add the pulp which has been scooped from 
the prepared fruit to some whole gooseberries, and stir them over a 
moderate fire for some minutes to extract the juice ; strain and wdgh 
this ; pour two pounds of it to four of the seeded gooseberries, boil 
them rather gently for twenty-five minutes, add fourteen ounces of 
eood poundea sugar to each pound of fruit and juice, and when it is 
lissolved boil the preserve from twelve to fifteen minutes longer, and 
skim it well during the time. 

Seeded sooseb^es, 4 lbs. ; juice of gooseberries, 2 lbs. : 25 
minutes. Sugar, 5i lbs. (or 14 oz. to each pound of fruit and juke) : 
12 to 15 minutes. 



JELLY OF RIPE GOOSEBERRIES.

Take the tops and stalks from a gallon or more of any kind of welt 
fl-ivoured ripe red gooseberries, and keep them stiired gently over a

dear fire until they have yielded all their juice, which should then be 
]X)ured off without pressing the fruit, and passed first through a fine 
rieye, and afterwards through a double muslin-strainer, or a jelly- 
bag. Next weigh it, and to every three pounds add one of white 
currant juice, which has preyiously been prepared in the same way ; 
bdl these quickly for a Quarter of an hour, then draw them from the 
fire and stu: to them half their weight of good su^ ; when this is 
dissolved, boil the jelly for six minutes longer, skun it thoroughly, 
and pour it into jars or moulds. K a veiy large quantity be made, 
a few minutes of additional boiling must be given to it before the 
SDffar is added. 

Juice of red gooseberries, 3 lbs. ; juice of white currants, 1 lb. : 
15 minutes. Sugar, 2 lbs. : 6 minutes. 

Ohs. — The same proportion of red currant juice, mixed with that 
of the gooeeberries, makes an exceedingly nice jelly. 

UNMIXBD QOOSEBERRT JELLT. 

Boil rapidly for ten minutes four pounds of the juice of red 
gooseberries, i)re]^ared as in the nreceoing receipt ; take it from the 
fire, and stir in it imtil dissolvea three pounds of sugar beaten to 
powder ; boil it a^ain for five minutes, keeping it constantly stirred 
and thoroughly skimmed. 

Juice of red gooseberries, 4 lbs. : 10 minutes. Sugar, 8 lbs. : 5 
minutes. 

GOOSEBERRY PASTE. 

Press through a sieve the eooseberries from which the juice has 
been taken for jelly, without naving been drained very closely from 
them ; weigh and then boil the pulp for upwards of an hour and a 

Quarter, or until it forms a dry paste in tne pan ; stir to it, off the 
re, six ounces of good poimded sugar for each pound of the fruit, 
and when this is nearly dissolved boil the preserve from twenty to 
twenty-five minutes, keeping it stirred without cessation, as it will be 
liable to bum should tnis be neglected. Put it into moulds, or 
shallow pans, and turn it it out when wanted for table. 

Pulp of gooseberries, 4 lbs. : 1^ to 1} hour. Sugar, 1^ lb. : 20 to 
25 minutes. 



TO DRY RIFE GOOSEBERRIES WITH SUGAR. 

Cut the tops, but not the stalks, firom some ripe gooseberries of 
the Ingest sise, either red or green ones, and after having taken out 
the seeds as directed for unripe ffooseberries, boil the fhiit until clear 
and tender, in sjprup made witn a pound of sugar to the pint of 
water, boiled until rather thick.

Seeded gooseberries, 2 lbs. ; siigar, 1^ lb. ; water, I |nnt : bofled to

Ooi. — Large ripe gooseberries freed from the blossoms, and put 
into cold syrup in which cherries or any other fruit has been boued 
lor drying, then heated very gradually, and kept at the point of 
boiling for a few minutes before they are set by for a coujde of days, 
answer extremely well as a dry preserve. On the third day me 
syrup should be drained from them, simmered, skimmed, and ponied 
on them the instant it is taken from the fire; in forty-eight hours 
after, they may be drained from it and laid singly upon plates or 
dishes, and placed in a gentle stove. 

JAM OF KENTISH OR FLBKIBH CHBBRIES. 

This is a very agreeable j^reserve when it is made as we sihall 
direct ; but if long boiled with a large proportion of sugar, as it 
frequently is, both the bright colour and the pleasant flavour of the 
cherries will be destrojred. 

Stone, and then weigh the fruit; heat it rather slowly that the 
juice may be well drawn out before it begins to boil, and stew the 
cherries until they are tolerably tender, then boil them quickly, 
keeping them well turned and stirred from the bottom of the pan, for 
three-quarters of an hour or somewhat longer should there stQl 
remain a largne quantity of juice. Draw the pan from the fire, and 
stir in gradually naif a poimd of sugar for each pound of cherries. 
An ounce or two more may occasionafiy be required when the fruit is 
more than usually add, and also when a quite sweet preserve is liked. 
When the sugar is dissolved continue the boiling rapidly for about 
twenty minutes lonser ; clear off all the scum as it appears, and keep 
the jam stirred weU and constantly, but not quickly, to prevent its 
adhering to the bottom of the preserving-pan. 

StonS Kentish or Flemish cherries, 6 lbs. : without sugar, 1 hour 
or rather more. Surar roughly powdered, 8 lbs.: (or 3} lbs.) 
About 20 minutes quick boiling. 

Oi^«.—Heat the firuit and lx)il it gently until it is auite tender, 
tuminff it often, and pressing it down into the juice ; tnen quicken 
the bouing to evaporate the juice before the sugar is added. Cherries 
which are bruisea will not make good preserve : they always remain 
tough. 

TO DBT CHERRIES WITH SUOAIU 

(A quick and easy method,) 

Stone some fine, sound, Kentish or Flemish cherries; put 
them into a preserving pan, with six ounces of sugar reduced to 
powder, to each pound of the fruit ; set them over a moderate fire^ 
and simmer them gently for nearly or quite twenty minutes; let

'them remain in the symp until they are a little cooled, then tnm 
them into a sieTe, and before they are cold la^ th^ singly on dishefl, 
and dry them verjr gradually, as directed ror other fmits. When 
the cherries are quite ripe the stones may generally be drawn out vrith 
the stalks, by pressing the fruit gently at the same time ; but when 
this method fails, thev must be extracted with a new quill, cut round 
at the end: those of the very short-stalked, turnip-shaped cheiry, 
which abounds, and is remarkably fine in many parts of Normandy, 
and which we haye occasionally met with here, tnough it is not, we 
believe, very abundant in our markets, are easily removed with a 
large pin, on the point of which the stone may be caught at the stalk 
en^ just opposite the seam of the fruit, and drawn out at the top, 
leaying the cnerry apparently entire. 

DRIED CHERRIES. 

(^Superior Receipf) 

To each pound of cherries weighed after they are stoned, add eight 
ounces of good sufisr, and boil them yery softly for ten minutes: 
pour them into a large bowl or pan, and leaye them for two days in 
the syrup ; then simmer them again for ten minutes, and set them 
Ixy in it for two or three days ; drain them slightly, and dry them 
yer^ slowly, as directed in theprevious receipts. Keep them in jars 
or tin canisters, when done. These cherries are generally preferred 
to such as are dried with a larger proportion of sugar ; but when the 
taste is in favour of the latter, from twelve to sixteen ounces can be 
allowed to the pound of fruit, which may then be potted in the 
fmrup and dried at any time; though we think the flavour of the 
cherries is better preserved when this is done within a fortnight of 
their being boiled. 

Cherries, stoned, 8 lbs. ; sugar, 4 lbs. : 10 minutes. Left two or 
three days. Boiled again, 10 minutes ; left two days ; drained and 
dried. 

CHERRIES DRIED WITHOUT SUGAR. 

These are often more pleasant and refreshing to invalids and tra- 
vellers than a sweetened confection of the fruit, their flavour and 
agreeable acidity being well preserved when they are simpler spread 
on dishes or hamper-lids, and slowly dried.* Throw aside the 
bruised and decayed fruit, and arrange the remainder singly, and 
witib the stalks uppermost on the dishes. The Kentish cherries are 
best for the purpose, but morellas also answer for it excellently, 
llie former are sometunes stoned, and simmered until quite tender in 
their own juice, before they are dried ; but this is scarcely an im- 
provement on the more usual method of leaving them entire.

804 MODERN COOKEBY. [cBAP.znr. 



TO DRT MORELLA CHERRIES. 

Take off the etalks but do not stone the fruit; weigh and add to 
it an equal quantity of the best sugar reduced ouite to powder, strew 
it over the cherries and let them stand for half an hour ; then turn 
them gently into a preserving-pan« and simmer them softly from five 
to seven minutes. Drain them from the syrup, and dry them like 
the Kentish cherries. They make a very fine confection. 

COMMON CHBRRT CHEESE. 

Stone the fruit, or if this trouble be objected to, bruise and boil 
it vrithout, until it is sufficiently tender to press through a sieve, 
which it will be in from twenty to thirty minutes. Weigh the pulp 
in this case, and boil it quickly to a diy paste, then stir to it six 
ounces of sugar for the pound of fruit, and when this is dissolved, 
place the pan again over, but not upon^ a brisk fire, and stir the 
preserve without ceasing, lutil it is so dry as not to adhere to the 
nnger when touched ; then press it immediately into small moulds or 
pans, and turn it from them when wanted for table. When the 
cherries have been stoned, a good common preserve may be made 
of them without passing them through a sieve, with the addition of 
five ounces of sugar to the pound of fruit, which must be boiled very 
dry both before and after it is added. 

Kentish or Flemish cherries without stoning: 20 to 30 minutes. 
Paused through a sieve. To each pound of pulp (first boiled dnr), 
6 oz. sugar. To each pound of cherries stoned and boiled to a irj 
paste, 6 oz. sugar. 

CHERRT PASTE. (FRENCH.) 

Stone the cherries: boil them gently in their own juice lor 
thirty minuted ; press the whole through a sieve ; reduce it to a veiy 
dry paste ; then take it from the fire, and weigh it ; boil an equal 
proportion of sugar to the candying point; mix the fruit with it; 
and stir the paste, without intermission, over a moderate fiie, until 
it is again so dry as to form a ball round the spoon, and to quit the

constantly stirred, but neither should in any case be neglected. 



8TRAWBBRRT-JELLT, 

A very Superior Preserve* (New Receipt,') 

The original directions for this delicious jelly, published in the 
earlier editions of this work, were the result of perfectly successful 
trials made in the summer of their insertion; but, after much 
additional experience, we find that the receipt may be better adapted 
to our varymg seasons, which so much anect the quality of our 
fruit, and rendered more certain in its results by some alterations ; 
we therefore give it anew, recommending it strongly for trial, 
especially to such of our readers as can command from their own 
gudens ample suj^plies of strawberries in their best and freshest 
state. Like all fruit intended for preserving, they should be gathered 
in dry weather, after the morning dew has quite passed off them, and 
be used the same day. Strip away the stalks, and put the straw- 
berries into an enamelled stewpan if at hand, and place it very high 
over a clear fire, that the juice may be drawn from them gently ; 
turn them over with a silver or wooden spoon from time to time, 
and when the juice has flowed from them abundantlv, let them 
simmer until tney shrink, but be sure to take them from the fire 
before the juice becomes thick or pulpy from over-boiling. Thirty 
minutes, or sometimes even longer, over a very slow fire, will not be 
too much to extract it from them. Turn them into a new, well- 
scalded, but dry sieve over a clean pan, and let them remain until 
the juice ceases to drop from them ; strain it then through a muslin 
strainer, weigh it in a basin, of which the weight must first be taken, 
and boil it quickly in a clean preserving-pan from fifteen to twenty 
minutes, and stir it often during the time : then take it from the 
fire, and throw in by degrees, for every pound of juice, fourteen 
ounces of the best sugar ccMirsely pounded, stirring each portion until 
it is dissolved. Fkce the pan again over the fire, and boil the jelly 
— still quickly— for about a quarter of an hour. Occasionally it 
may need a rather longer time than this, and sometimes less: the 
exact degree can only be ascertained by a little experience, in con- 
sequence of the juice of some varieties of the firuit being so much 
thmner than that of others. The preserve should jelly strongly on 
the skimmer, and fall in a mass from it before it is poured out ; but 
if boiled b^ond this point it will be spoiled. If niade with richly- 
flavoured strawberries, aud carefully managed, it will be very 
brilliant in colour, and in flavour really equal if not superior to 
goftva jelly ; while it will retain all the delicious odour of the fhiit 



506 MOBEBK COOKEBY. [chap. xxit. 

No skiimner or other utensil of tin Bbould be used in making it ; and 
an enamelled preserving-pan is preferable to any other for all zed 
fruit. It becomes very finn often after it is stored, when it appears 
scarcely set in the first instance; it is, howeyer, desirable tluit it 
should jelly at once. 

Fruit kept hot to draw out the juice, i hour or longer. Boiled 
quickly without si^ar, 15 to 20 minutes. To each poum 14 os. of 
sugar : 12 to 15 minutes. 

TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES OR RASPBERRIES, FOR CREAMS 
OR ICES, WITHOUT BOILING. 

Let the fhdt be gathered in the middle of a warm day, in veiy 
<dry weather; strip it from the stalks directly, weigh it, bruise it 
slighUifj turn it into a bowl or deep pan, and mix with it an equal 
weight of fine dry sifted sugar, and put immediately into small, wide- 
necked bottles ; cork these firmly without delay, and tie bladder over 
the tops. Keep them in a cool place, or the fruit will ferment. The 
mixture should be stirred softly, and only just sufficiently to blend 
the sugar and the fruit. The bottles must be perfectly diy, and the 
bladders, after having been cleaned in the usual way, and allowed to 
become nearly so, should be moistened with a Uttle spirit on the side 
which is to be next to the cork. Unless these precautions be 
observed, there will be some danger of the whole being spoiled. 

Equal weight of fruit and sugar. 



RASPBERRT JAM. 

This is a very favourite English preserve, and one of tiie most 
<easily made that can be. The miit tor it should be ripe and per- 
fectly sound; and as it soon decays or becomes mouldy after it is 
gathered, it should be fresh from the bushes when it is used. That 
which grows in the shade has less flavour than the fruit which 
receives the full warmth of the sun. 

Excellent jam for common fkmily use may be made as follows : — 

Bruise gently with the back of a wooden spoon, six pounds of ripe 
and freshly-gathered raspberries, and boQ them over a brisk fire 
for twenty-five minutes ; stir to them half their wdffht of good 
su^, roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, boil tne preserve 
qmckly for ten minutes, keeping it well starred and skimmed. 

Raspberries, 6 lbs. : 25 mmutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 10 minutes.

about five minutea, then

and continue the lM>iling' rather rapidly for a quarter of an hour or

The preserve will be clear, smooth, and very thick when it is suf- 
ficiently boiled, and should then be taken from the pan without 
delay, as it will very quickly set

half to a whole pound of juice, and boil down in this three pounds 
of the fruit, after it has been crushed with a spoon as usual. In ten 
minutes, if the fruit be quite ripe, the su^ may be added. Three 
pounds to four of the raspberries and their juice, will make a quite 
sweet preserve. It should be gradually stirred in until dissolved, 
and not be allowed to boil during the time. Ten or fifteen minutes 
will then suffice generally to bring it to the proper d^;ree for jellying 
firmly.

and let them drain well, but without pressure. Pass the juiee 
through a folded muslin or a jelly-bag ; weigh it, and then boil it 
fast for a quarter of an hour ; add for each pound, eight ounces of 
sugar coarsely powdered, stir this to it off the iu« tmtil it ia dissolved, 

5;ive the jelly eight minutes more of quick boiling, and pour it out. 
t will be firm, and of excellent colour and fiavour. Be sure to ctear 
off the scum as it rises, both before and after the sugar is put in, or 
the preserve will not be dear. 

Juice of red currants, 8 lbs. ; juice of white currants, 1 lb. : 15

BUPEBLATITB RED CUHRANT JSLLT. 
(Norman Receipt.) 

Strip carefully from the stems some qiiite ripe currants of the 
finest quality, and mix with them an equal weignt of good sugar re- 
duced to powder; boil these together quiddy for exactly eieht 
minutes, keep them stirred all the time, and clear off the scum — which 
inll be very abundant— as it rises ; then turn the preserve into a very 
dean sieve, and put into small jars the jelly which runs through it, 
and which will be delicious in flavour, and of the brightest colour. 
It'should be carried immediately, when this is practicable, to an ex- 
tremely cool but not a damp place, and left there until perfectly cold. 
The currants which remain in the sieve make an excellent jam, par- 
ticularly if only part of the jelly be taken from thenL In Normandy, 
where the fruit is of richer quality than in Enghmd, this preserve 
is boiled only two minutes, and is both firm and beautifully trans- 
parent. 

Currants, 3 lbs. ; sugar, 3 lbs. : 8 minutes. 

Ob*. — ^This receipt vre are told by some of our correspondents is 
not generally quite successful in this country, as the jelly, though it 
keeps well and is of the finest possible flavour, is scarcely firm enough 
for table. We have ourselves found this to be the case in cold damp 
seasons ; but the preserve even then was valuable for many purposes, 
and always agreeable eating. 

FRENCH CURRANT JELLY. 

Mix one-third of white currants with two of red, and stir them 
over a gentle fire until they render their juioe freely; pour it from 
them, strain and weigh it ; for every four pounds break three of fine 
vogar into large lumps, just dip them into cold water, and when they 
are nearly di^lved boil them to a thick syrup ; stir this without 
eeasing until it falls in larg^ thick white masses from the skimmer ; 
then pour in the currant juice immediately, and when the sugar is 
again dissolved, boil the whole quickly for five minutes, clear ofi* the 
scum perfectly, pour the jelly into jars or warm glasses, and set it in 
a cool place. 

Bed currants, two-thirds ; white currants, one-third ; juice, 4 lbs. ; 
sugar boiled to candy height, 3 lbs. : jelly boiled, 5 minutes. 

Ohe. — A flavouring of raspberries is usually given to currant jelly 
in France, the preserve being there never served with any kind of 
joint, as it is with us. 

DELICIOUS RED CURRANT JAM. 

This, which is but an indifierent preserve when made in the usual 
way, vnil be found a very fine one if the following directions for it ba 



510 MODEBK COOKEBT. [c&AP. ZXXT 

obflerred ; it will be extremely tranmient and bright in oolonr, and 
will retain perfectly the flavour of the froit. Take the currants at 
the heiffht of their season, the finest that can be had, firee from dust^ 
but gauiered on a dry da^; strip them with great care from the 
stalks, weigh and put them mto a preserving-pan with three pounds 
of the best sugar reduced to powder, to four potmds of the fruit : stir 
them gently over a brisk clear fire, and boil them quickly for exactly 
eight minutes from the first fail boil. As the jam is apt to rise over 
the top of the pan, it is better not to fill it more than two-thirds, and 
if this nrecaution should not be sufiicient to prevent it, it must be 
lifted m>m the fire and held away for an instant. To many tastes, a 
still finer jam than this Twhich we find sufiidently sweetj may be 
made with an equal weight of fruit and sugar boiled together for 
seven minutes. There should be great exactness with respect to the 
time, as both the flavour and the brilliant colour of the preserve will 
be ii\jured by longer boiling. 

Red currants (without stalks), 4 lbs. ; fine sugar, 3 lbs. : boiled 
quickly, 8 minutes. Or, equal weight fruit and sugar : 7 minutes. 

VERY FINB WHITE CHTRRAKT JELLY. 

The fruit for this jelly should be very white, perfectly free from 
dust, and picked carefully from the stalks. To every pound add 
eighteen ounces of double refined sifted suear, and boil them together 
quickly for eight minutes ; ^ur it into a delicately dean sieve, and 
nnish it by the directions given for the Norman red currant jelly 
^ i 659), 

ite currants, 6 lbs. ; highly refined sugar, 6| lbs. : 6 minutes. 

WHITE CURRANT JAM, A BEAUTIFUL PRESERYE. 

Boil together quickly for seven minutes an equal weight of fine 
white currants, stalked with the greatest nicety, and of the best sugar 
pounded and passed through a sieve. Stir the preserve genUy mt 
whole time, and be careful to skim it thoroughly. 

White currants, 4 lbs. ; best sugar, 4 lbs. : 7 minutes. 

CURRAIVT PASTE. 

Stalk and heat some red currants as for jelly, pour off three parti 
of the juice, which can be used for that preserve, and press the re- 
mainder, with the pulp of the fruit, closely through a hair sieve 
reversed ; boil it briskly, keeping it stirred the whole time, until it 
forms a dry paste ; then for eadi pound (when first weighed) add 
seven ounces of pounded sugar, and boil the whole from twenty-five 
to thirty minutes longer, tiuung care that it shall not bum. This 
paste is remarkably pleasant and refreshing in cases of fever, and ac- 
ceptable often for wintei^desserts. 



CHAP. XZIT.] PBE8EBTES. 611 

Bed currants boiled from 5 to 7 minntes, pressed "with one-fourth 
of their juice through a sieye, boiled from 1^ to 2 hour. To each 
pound 7 oz. pounded sugar : 25 to 30 minutes. 

06<.— Confectioners add the pulp, after it is boiled diy, to an equal 
weisht of sugar at the candy height : by making trial of the two 
meuiods, the reader can decide on the better one. 



FmS BLACK CURRANT JELLY. 

Stir some black currants over the fire until they have yielded their 
juice ; strain, weigh, and boil it for twenty minutes ; add to it three 
pounds and a half of sifted su^ of good quality, made quite hot, and 
when it is dissolved boil the jelly for five minutes only, clearing off 
the scum with care. This, though an excellent preserve, is too sweet 
for our own taste, and we think one made with less sugar likely to be 
more acceptable in cases of indisposition generally. 

Juice of black currants, 4 lbs. : 20 minutes. Sugar, 3| lbs. : 5 
minutes. 

COMMON BLACK CURRANT JELLY. 

Boil from three to six pounds of the juice rapidly for twenty 
minutes, stirrine it well; then mix with it off the fire, half a pound 
of sugar for eaoi poxmd of juice, and continue the boiling for ten 
minutes. 

Juice of black currants, 3 to 6 lbs. : 20 minutes. To each pound 
juice i lb. good sugar : 10 minutes. 

O^^.—This jelly may be made with Lisbon sugar, but will then 
require rather more boiling. 

BLACK CURRANT JAM AND MARMALADE. 

No fruit pellies so easily as black currants when they are ripe ; and 
their juice is so rich and thick that it will bear the addition of a very 
small quantity of water sometimes, without causing the preserve to 
mould. When the currants have been very dusty, we nave occa- 
sionally had them washed and drained before they were used, without 
an^ injurious effects. Jam boiled down in the usual manner with 
this fiioit is often very dry. It majr be greatly improved by taking 
out nearly half the currants when it is ready to be potted, pressing 
them well against the side of the preserving-pan to extract the juice : 
this leaves the remainder far more liquid and refreshing than when 
the skins are all retained. Another mode of making fine black cur- 
rant jam— as well as that of any other fruit—is to add one pound at 
least of juice, extracted as for jelly, to two pounds of the berries, and 
to allow sugar for it in the same proportion as directed for each pound 
of them. 

For marmalade or paste, which is most useful in affections of the

throat and chest, the eornuits must he stewed tend^ in their onm 
juice, and then mbhed through a siere. After ten minutes* btnling, 
sugar in fine powder must m stirred gradually to the pulp, off OSe 
fixe, until it is dissolTed : a few minutes more of hoiling will then 
suffice to render the preserve thick, and it will become quite firm 
when cold. More or less sugar can be added to the taste, but it is 
not generally liked very sweet. 

Sett black CKmon/yam.— Currants, 4 lbs. ; juice of currants, 2 lbs. : 
15 to 20 minutes* gentle boiling. Sugar, 3 to 4 lbs. : 10 minutes. 

Marmalade^ or paste of black ciimin<«.— Fruit, 4 lbs. : stewed in its 
own juice 15 minutes, or until quite soft. Pulp boiled 10 minutes. 
Sugar, firom 7 to 9 os. to the lb. : 10 to 14 minutes. 

Obi. — The following are the receipts originally inserted in this 
work, and which we leave unaltered. 

To six pounds of the fruit, stripped carefiilly from the stalks, add 
four pounds and a half of sugar. Let them heat gently, but as soon 
as the sugar is dissolved boil the preserve rapidlv for fifteen minutes. 
A more common kind of jam may be made oy boiling the fruit by 
itself firom ten to fifteen minut^ and for ten minutes after half its 
weight of sugar has been added to it. 

Black currants, 6 lbs ; sugar, 4^ lbs. : 15 minutes. Or : fruit, 6 
lbs. : 10 to 15 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 10 minutes. 

05«.— There are few prenarations of fruit so refreshing and so 
useful in illness as those of black currants, and it is therefore advis- 
able always to have a store of them, and to have them well and caie- 
frdlymade 

NURSEBT PBBSERVB. 

Take the stones frt>m a couple of pounds of Kentish cherries, and 
boil them twenty minutes ; then add to them a pound and a half of 
raspberries, and an equal quantity of red and of white currants, all 
weighed after they have been cleared from their stems. Boil these 
together quickly for twenty minutes ; mix with them three pounds 
and a quarter of common sugar, and give the preserve fifteen minutes 
more of quick boiling. A pound and a half of gooseberries may be 
substituted for the cnerries ; but they will not require any stewimr 
before they are added to the other fruits. The jam must be weU 
stirred from the beginning, or it will bum to the pan. 

Kentish cherries, 2 Ibe. : 20 minutes. Baspberries, red currants, 
and white currants, of each H lb. : 20 minutes. Sugar, 3\ lbs. : 15 

▲KOTHER GOOD COMMON PBESERVE. 

Boil together, in equal or unequal portions (for this is immaterial), 
Kn^ kinds of early fruit, until they can be pressed through a sieve; 
weigh, and then boil the pulp over a brisk nre for half an hour ; add 



CHAP. uavJ] PBESEBYES. 513 

half a pound of sugar for each pound of fhiit, and again hoil the 
preserve quickly, keying it well stirred and skinuned, from fifteen 
to twenty minutes. Cherries, unless they he morellas, must first he 
stewed tender apart, as they will reqiure a much longer time to make 
them so than any other of the fiirst summer fruits. 

A OOOD m£lAN6E^ OR MIXED PRESEBYE. 

Boil for three-quarters of an hour in two pounds of clear red 
gooseherry juice, one pound of very ripe greengages, weighed after

SUPERIOR PIKE-APPLE MARMALADE. 

(A New Receipt) 

The market-price of our English pines is generally too high to 
pennit their bemg veiy commonly used for preserve; and though 
some of those imported from the West Indies are sufficiently weU- 
flavoured to make excellent jam, they must be selected with judg- 
ment for the purpose, or they will possibly not answer for it. They 
should be fully ripe, but perfectly sound: should the stalk end 
appear mouldy or discoloured, the fruit should be rejected. The 
degree of flavour which it possesses may be ascertained with tolerable 
accuracy by its odour; for if of good quality, and fit for use, it will

he very fingnmt After the rinds haye been paied ofi^ and ereiy 
dark speck taken from the flesh, the puies may be lasped on a fine 
and delicately clean grater, or sliced thin, cut np qtdckly into dice, 
and poinded in a stone or marble mortar; or a portion may be 
grated, and the remainder reduced to pulp in the mortar. Weidb, 
and then heat and boil it gently for ten minutes; draw it from Uie 
fire, and stir to it by d^^^rees fourteen ounces of sugar to the pound 
of fruit ; boil it until it thickens and becomes very transparent, 
which it will be in about fifteen minutes, should the qfuantity be 
small : it will require a rather longer time if it be large. The sugar 
ought to be of the best quality and beaten quite to powder ; andror 
this, as well as for every other kind of preserve, it should be dry, A 
remarkably fine marmalade may be compounded of English pines 
oxdy, or even with one English pine of superior growth, and two or 
three of the West Indian mixed with it ; but all when used should 
be fvUy ripe^ without at all verging on decay ; for in no other stale 
will their delicious flavour be in its perfection. 

In making the jam always avoid placing the preserving-pan Jlat 
upon (hefire^ as this of itself will often convert what would otherwise 
be excellent preserve, into a strange sort of compound, for which it 
is difficult to find a name, and wmch results from the sugar being 
subjected — ^when in combination with the add of the fruit — to a 
degree of heat which converts it into caramel or highly-boiled 
i)arley-8Ugar. When there is no r^;ular preserving-stove, a fht 
trivet should be securely placed across the fire of the kitchen-range 
to raise the pan from immediate contact with the burning coals, or 
charcoal. It is better to grate down, than to pound the fruic for 
the present receipt should any parts of it be ever so slightly tough ; 
and It should then be slowly stewed until quite tender before any 
sugar is added to it ; or with only a very small quantity stirred in 
should it become too dry. A superior marmalade even to this, might 
probably be made by adding to the rasjped pines a little juice drawn 
oy a gentle heat, or expressed cold, from inferior portions of the 
fruit ; but this is only supposition. 

A FINE PRBSEByS OF THB GREEN ORANGE PLUM* 

{Sometimes eaUed M« Stonewood phan.) 

This fruit, which is very insipid when ripe, makes an excellent 
preserve if used when at its full growth, but while it is still quite 
hard and green. Take olf the stalks, wei^h the plums, then eaah 
them well (with a silver knife, if convenient^ as Ihey are thrown mto 
the preserving-pan, and keep them gently stirred without ceasing 
over a moderate fire, until they have yielded sufficient juice to pre- 
rent their burning ; after this, boil them quickly until the stones are 
entirely detached from the flesh of the frxut. Take them out as they 
appear on the surface, and when the preserye looks quite smooth and 



«HAP zzrr.] PB£S£By£& 515 

is well reduced, stir in three-quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to 
a {>owder, for each pound of the plums, and boil the whole yeir 
quickly for half an hour or more. Put it, when done, into small 
moulds or pans, and it will be sufficiently finn when cold to turn out 
well : it will also be transparent, of a fine green colour, and yeiy 
agreeable in flavour. 

Orange plums, when green, 6 lbs. : 40 to 60 minutes. Suinr, 
4} lbs. : 80 to 50 minutes. 

Oht.—The blanched kernels of part of the fruit should be added 
to this preserve a few minutes before it is poured out : if too Iod 
boiled in it thev will become tough. They shoidd always be wip 
veiy dry after they are blanched. 

OREBNGAGB JAH, OB HARMAIiADE. 

When the plums are thoroughly ripe, take off the skins, stone, 
weigh, and boil them auickly wiUiout sugar for fifty minutes, keepioff 
them well stirred; then to every four pounds add three of good 
sugar reduced quite to powder, boil the preserve from five to eight 
minutes longer, and clear off the scum perfectly before it is poured 
into the jars. When the flesh of the firuit will not separate easily 
from the stones, weigh and throw the plums whole into the preserv- 
ing-pan, boil them to a pulp, pass them through a sieve, and deduct 
the weight of the stones from them when apportioning the sugar to 
the jam. The Orleans plum may be substituted for greengages in 
this receipt. 

Greengages, stoned and skinned, 6 lbs.: 50 minutes. Sugar, 
4i lbs. : 5 to 8 minutes. 

PRESERVE OF THE MAGNUM BONUM, OR MOGUL PLUM. 

Prepare, weigh, and boil the plums for forty minutes ; stir to them 
half ueir weight of good sugar beaten fine, and when it is dissolved 
continue the Doilin^ for ten additional minutes, and skim the pre- 
serve careftdly dunnff the time. This is an excellent marmalade, 
but it may be renderea richer by increasing the proportion of sugar 
The bluiched kernels of a portion of the fhut stones will much 
improve its flavour, but thev should be mixed with it only two or 
thrce minutes before it is taken from the fire. When the plums are 
not entirely ripe, it is difficult to free them from the stones and 
skins : they should then be boiled down and pressed through a sieve, 
as directed for grcenpges, in the receipt above. 

Mogul plums^ skinned and stoned, 6 lbs. : 40 minutes. Sugar, 
3 lbs. : 5 to 8 minutes. 

TO DRY OR PRBSERTE MOGUL PLUMS IN BYRUP. 

Fare the plums, but do not remove the stalks or stones ; take their 
weight of iry sifted sugar, lay them into a deep dish or bowl, and 



816 MODEBN COOKEBT. [CHAF. ZZIT« 

gtrew it over them; let them remain thus for a nigLt, then ponr 
them gently into a preserving-pan with all the sugar, heat them 
slowly, and let them just simmer for five minutes ; in two days 
repeat the process, and do so again and again at an interval of two or 
three days, until the fruit is tender and very clear ; put it then into 
jars, and keep it in the syrup, or drain and dry the plums Teiy 
gradually, as dir^sted for other finait. When they are not sufficiently 
ripe for the skin to part from them readily, they must be oovered 
wuh spring water, placed over a slow fire, and just scalded until it 
can be stripped from them easily. They may also be entirely pre* 
pared by the receipt for dried apricots which follows, a page or two 
fhun this. 



XUS8EL PLUM CHEESE AlO) JELLT. 

Fill large stone jars with the fruit, which should be ripe, dry, and 
Bound; set them into an oven from which the bread has been drawn 
•eyeral hours, and let them remain all night ; or, if this cannot con- 
yeniently be done, place them in pans of water, and boil them gently 
vntil the plums are tender, and have yielded their juice to the 
utmost, rour this frt>m them, strain it through a jelly bag, weiefa, 
and then boil it rapidly for twenlj-fiye minutes. Have ready, 
broken small, three pounds of sugar for four of the juice, stir them 
together untU it is oissolyed, and then continue the boiling quickly 
for ten minutes longer, and be careful to remove all the scum. Pour 
the preserve into small moulds or pans, and turn it out when it n 
wanted for table : it will be very fine, both in colour and in flavoar. 

Juice of plums, 4 lbs. : 25 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 10 minutes. 

The cheese.— Skin and stone the plums from which the juice has 
been poured, and after having weighed, boil them an hour and a 
quarter over a brisk fire, and stir them constantly; then to three 
pounds of fruit add one of sugar, beaten to powder ; boil the pieserve 
for another half hour, and press it into shallow pans or moulos. 

Plums, 8 lbs. : 1^ hour. Sugar, 1 lb. : 80 mmutes. 



APRICOT MARMALADE. 

This may be made either by the receipt for greengage, or Mogul 
plum marmalade ; or the fruit may first be boiled quite tender, then 
rubbed through a sieve, and mixed with three-quarters of a pound 
of sugar to the pound of apricots : from twenty to thirty minutes will 
boil it in this case. A richer preserve still is produced by taking off 
the skins, and dividing the plums in halves or quarters, and leaving 
Uiem for some hours with their weight of fine sugar strewed over 
them before they are placed on the fire ; they are then heated slowly 
and gertly simmered for about half an hour. 



CHAP. ZXIT.] PBESEBYES. 517 

TO DRY APRICOTS. 
(A quick and eaty method,) 

Wii>e gently, split, and stone some fine apricots which are not 
oyer-ripe ; weigh, and arrange them evenly in a deep dish or bowl, 
and strew in fourteen ounces of sugar in fine powder, to each pound 
of fruit ; on the following; day turn the whole carefully into a pre- 
servine-pan, let the apricots heat slowly, and simmer them very 
softly for six minutes, or for an instant longer, should they not in 
that time be quite tender. Let them remain in the syrup for a day 
or two, then drain and spread them singly on dishes to dry. 

To each pound of apncots, 14 oz. of sugar ; to stand 1 night, to be 
simmered from 6 to 8 minutes, and left in syrup 2 or 3 days. 

DRIED APRICOTS. 
(French Receipt^ 

Take apricots which have attained their full erowth and colour, 
but before they begin to soften ; weish, and wipe uiem lightly ; make 
a small incision across the top of ea& plum, pass the pomt of a knife 
throuffh the stalk end, and gently push out the stones without 
breakmg the fruit; next, put the apricots into a preserving-pan, 
with simdent cold water to float them easily; place it over a 
moderate fire, and when it beeins to boil, should the apricots be quite 
tender, lift them out and throw them into more cold water, but 
simmer them, otherwise, until they are so. Take the same weight of 
sogar that there was of the fruit before it was stoned, and boil it for 
ten minutes with a quart of water to the four pounds ; skim the 
syrup carefully, throw in the apricots (which should previously be 
well drained on a soft cloth, or on a sieve), simmer them for one 
minute, and set them by in it until the following day, then drain it 
from them, boil it for ten minutes, and pour it on them the instant it 
is taken fjrom the fire ; in forty-eight hours rei>eat the process, and 
when the syrup has lioiled ten minutes, put in the apricots, and 
simmer them from two to four minutes, or until they look quite 
dear. They may be stored in the syrup until wanted for dr3ring, or 
drained from it, laid separately on slates or dishes, and dried very 
gradually: the blanched kernels may be put inside the fruit, or 
added to the syrup. 

Apricots, 4 lbs., scalded until tender ; sugar 4 lbs. ; water, 1 quart : 
10 minutes. Apricots, in ^up, 1 minute ; left 24 hours. Syrup, 
boiled again, 10 minutes, and poured on fruit : stand 2 days. Syrup, 
boiled again, 10 minutes, and apricots 2 to 4 minutes, or until clear. 

Oh9, — The syrup should be quite thick when the apricots are put 
m for the last time; but both fiiiit and sugar vary so mudi in 
f udity and in the degree of boiling which they require, that no 



518 MODERK COOKERY. [cRAP. xnr. 

imvariaNe rale can be ^yen for the latter. The apricot syrap 
strained very dear, and mixed with twice its measure of pale Frencb 
brandy, makes an agreeable liaueur, which is much im]jn>Ted by 
infusing in it for a few days naif an ounce of the fruit-kemels, 
blanchal and bruised, to the quart of liquor. 

We have found that cherries prepared by either of the receipts 
which we have given for preserving tnem wiu sugar, if thrown into 
the apricot syrup when partiallv dned, just scalded in it, and left for 
a fortnight, then drained and dried as usual, become a delicious 
sweetmeat Mussel, imperatrice, or any other plums, when quite 
ripe, if simmered in it very gently until they are tender, and len for 
a few da^ to imbibe its flavour, then drained and finished as usual, 
are likewise exoe^ent. 

PEACH JAM, OR MARMALADE. 

The fhiit for this preserve, which is a veiy delicious one, should 
be finely flavoured, and quite ripe, though perfectly sound. Pare, 
stone, weiffh, and boil it ouickly for three-ouarters of an hour, and 
do not fail to stir it often auriuff the time ; draw it from the fire, and 
mix with it ten ounces of w^l-refined sugar, rolled or beaten to 
powder, for each pound of the peaches ; clear it carefully firom scum, 
and boil it briskly for five minutes ; throw in the stramed juice of 
one or two good lemons; continue the boiling for three minutes only, 
and pour out the marmalade. Two minutes after the sufl;ar is stirred 
to the fruit, add the blanched kernels of part of the peaches. 

Peaches, stoned and pared, 4 lbs.; | hour. Su^, 2i lbs.: 2 
minutes. Blanched peach-kernels: 3 minutes. Juice of 2 smali 
lemons : S minutes. 

O&f.— This jam, like most others, is improved by pressing the 
fruit through a sieve after it has been partially boiled. I^othing can 
be finer than its flavour, which would be mjured by adding the 
sugar at first ; and a laijger proportion renders it cloyingly sweet 
Nectarines and peaches mued, make an admirable preserve 

TO FRESERVEy OR TO DRY PEACHES OR NECTARDfES. 

(^fi easy and exceUeni Receipt,) 

The fruit should be ^e^ freshly gathered, and /vffy ripe, but still 
in its perfection. Pare, halve, and weigh it after the stones are 
removed ; lay it into a deep dish, and strew over it an ojuaL weight 
of highly refined pounded sugar ; let it remain until tins is nearly 
dissolved, then lift the fruit gently into a preserving-pan, pour the 
juice and sugar to it, and heat the whole over a very slow fire; let it 
jUst simmer for ten minutes, then turn it softly into a bowl, and let 
it remain for two days ; repeat the slow heating and simmering at 
intervals of two or three days, until the firuit is quite dear, when it

may be potted in the Bjrupj or drained from it, and ^xied upon large 
clean slates or diflhes, or upon wire-sieTes. The flayonr will be 
excellent. The strained juice of a lemon may be added to the sjrrup, 
"with good effect, towards the end of the process, and an additional 
ounce or two of sugar allowed for it. 

PAMSON JAM. (yEBT OOOD.) 

The fruit for this jam should be freshly withered and quite ripe*. 
Split, stone, weigh, uid boil it quickly for fort^ minutes ; then stir 
in half its weight of good sugar roughly powdered, and when it is 
dissolved, give the preserve fifteen minutes additional boiling, keeping 
it stirred, and thoroughly skimmed. 

Damsons, stoned, 6 lbs. : 40 minutes. Sugar, 8 lbs. : 15 minutes. 

Obs.-^A more refined preserve is nude by pressing the fruit 
through a aeve after it is boiled tender; but the jam is excellent 
without. 

DAMaON JBLLY. 

Bake separately in a very slow oven, or boQ in a pan or copper 
of water as described at page 487, any number of fine ripe oun- 
sons, and one-third the quantity of bullaces, or of an^ otner pale 
plums, as a portion of their juice will, to most tastes, improve, by 
softening the flavour of the preserve, and will render tne colour 
Inighter. Four off the juice clear from the fruit, strain and weigh 
it; boil it quickly without sugar for twenty-five minutes, draw it 
from the fire, stir into it ten ounces of good sugar for each pound of 
juice, and boU it quickly from six to ten minutes longer, carefiilly 
clearing off all the scum. The jelly must be often stirired before the 
angar is added, and constantly uterwards. 

DAMSOKy OR BED PLUM SOLID. (gOOD.) 

Pour the juice from some damsons which have stood for a night in 
a very cool oven, or been stewed in a jar placed in a pan of water ; 
weigh and put it into a preserving pan with a pound and four 
ounces of peannains (or of any otner fine boiling apples), pared, 
cored, and quartered, to each pound of the juice ; boil tnese together^ 
keeping them well stirred, from twenty-five to thirty minutcS, then 
add the sugar, and when it is nearly ussolved, continue the boiling 
for ten minutes. This, if done with exactness, wiU give a perfectly 
smooth and firm preserve, which may be moulded in small shapes^ 
and turned out for table. The juice of any good red plum may be 
used for it instead of that of damsons. 

To each pound dear damson-juice, 1^ lb. peannains (or other 
good apples), pared and cored : 25 to SO minutes. Sugar, 14 os : 10

ihrooffh a thick Btrainer or jelly-baff, and weigh it ; boil it quickly 
from fifteen to twenty minutes ; take it from the fire, and stir in 
it till dissolved three-quarters of a pound of sugar to the pound of 
juice; remove the scum with care, and boil the preserve again 
quickly from eight to twelve mmut^ or longer should it not wen 
jelly furmly on the skimmer. When the fruit is very acid, an equal 
weight of luice and sugar may be mixed together in the first instance, 
and boiled briskly for about twenty minutes. It is impossible to 
indicate the precise time which the jelly will require, so much de- 
pends on the quality of the plums, and on the d^ree of boiling 
previously riven to them in the water-bath. When properly made 
It is remarkably transparent and very firm. It should be poured 
into shallow pans or small moulds, and turned from them before it \a 
served. When the imperatrice plum cannot be procured, any other 
that will give a pale red colour to the juice will answer. The 
bullaces alone make an admirable preserve ; and even the commoner 
kinds afford an excellent one. 

Juice of the shepherd's bullace and imperatrice, or other red plum, 
4 lbs: 15 to 20 mmutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 8 to 12 minutes. Or juice 
of bullaces and sugar, equal weight : 20 minutes. 

06*. —After the juice nas been poured from the plums they may 
be stoned, pared, weighed, and DoUed to a paste ; then six ounces 
of sugar added to the pound, and the boiling continued until the 
preserve is agdn very diy ; a small portion of the juice should be 
left with the fimit for this. 

VERY FINE IMPERATRICE PLUM MARMALADE. 

Weigh six pounds of the fruit when it vs quite ripe, but before the 
frost has toucned it ; give each plum a cut as it is thrown into the 
preserving-pan, and when all are done boil them firom thirty-five 
to forty minutes, taking out the stones as they rise to the surface, 
when they are quite detached firom the flesh of the fruit Draw 
back the pan from the fire, stir in two pounds of good sugar beaten 
to powder, and boil the preserve quickly for fift^ minutes. The 
imperatrice plum is of itself so sweet that thb proportion of sugar 
makes with it a very rich preserve. 

Imperatrice plums (witnout the stalks) 6 lbs.: boiled 35 to 40 
minutes. Sugar 2 lbs. (added after the stones are out) :^ 15 minutes. 

Obs. — Some slight trouble would be avoided by pressing the flruit 
through a sieve after the first boiling; but we do not think the 
marmalade would be improved by being forced fh>m the skins of the 
plums. 

TO DRY IMPERATRICE PLUMS. 

(An easy methods) 
Put them into jars, or wide-necked bottles, with half a pound of 



623 MODEBN COOKBRT. [chap. XZXT. 

g;ood sagar, rolled or ponnded, to twice the weight of fruit ; set dxem 
into a very cool oven for four or fiye hours ; or, if more oonVenient, 
place them, with a little hay between them, in a pan of cold water 
and boil them ffently for rather more than three hours. Leare them 
in the 83rmp ror a few days, and finish them as directed fbr the 
drying of otner fruits. Tie a bladder over the necks of the jan or 
bottles before they are placed in the pan of water, and fasten two or 
three folds of paper oyer the former, or cork the bottles when the 
fruit is to be baked. The sugar should be put in after the trvdt^ 
without bein^ shaken down ; it will then dissolve gradually, and be 
absorbed by it equally. 

To each pound of plums, 8 ounces ponnded sugar : baked in oool 
OTcn 4 or 5 hours, or steamed 3 hours. 

TO BOTTI.E FRUIT FOR WINTER USE. 

Gather the fruit in the middle of the day in very dry weather;, 
strip off the stalks, and have in readiness some penectly dean and 
diT wide-necked bottles ; turn each of these the instant before it ia 
filled, with the neck downwards, and hold in it two or three lighted 
matches : drop in the firuit before the vapour escapes, diake it gently 
down, press m some new corks, dip the necks of the bottles inta 
melted resin, set them at night into an oven from which the bread 
has been drawn six or seven hours at least, and let them remain 
until the morning : if the heat be too great the bottles will burst 
CurrantSi cherries, damsons, greengages, and various other kinds <^ 
plums will remain sood for quite twelve months when bottled thosi 
if stored in a dry place. 

To steam the fniit, put the bottles into a copper or other vessel np 
to their necks in cold water, with a little hay between and under 
them ; light the &ne, let the water heat slowly, and keep it at the 
point of gentle simmering until the fruit is sufficiently scalded. 
Some kinds will of course require a much longer time than othea 
From half to three quarters of an hour will be sufficient for eoose- 
berries, currants, and raspberries; but the appearance of aU will 
best denote their being done. When they have sunk almost half the 
depth of the bottles, and the skins are slmvelled, extinguish the fire, 
but leave them in the water until it is quite cold ; then wipe and 
store the bottles in a dry place. A bit of moistened bladder tied over 
corks is better than the resin when the fruit is steamed. 

APPLE JELLT. 

Various kind of apples may be used suocessfiilly to make this jelly^ 
but the nonsuch is by many persons preferred to all others for the 
purpose. The Ripstone pippin, however, may be used for it with 
veiy good effect, either solely, or with a mixture of pearmains. It is 
necessary only that the fruit should be finely flavoured, and that it 



CHAT. ZZIT.] PBESEBYE& 523 

ahould boil easily to a maimalade. Fare, core, quarter, and weigh it 
qtdckly that it may not lose its colour, and to each pound pour a pint 
of cold water and boil it until it is well broken, without being re- 
duced to a quite thick pulp, as it woiQd then be difficult to render 
the juice perfectly clear, which it ought to be. Drain this well from 
the apples, either through a fine sieye or a folded muslin strainer, 
pass It afterwards through a jelly-bag, or turn the fruit at once into 
the last of these, and pour the liquid through a second time if needful 
When it appears quite transparent, weigh, and reduce it by quick 
boiling for twenty minutes ; draw it from the fire, add two pounds of 
angar broken yeiy small, for three of the decoction ; stir it tiU it is 
entirely dissolyed, then place the preserying-pan again oyer a clear 
fire and boil the preserye quickly for ten mmutes, or until it jelliea 
firmly upon the dimmer wnen poured from it ; throw in the strained 
juice of a small lemon for eyery two pounds of jelly, two minutes 
before it is taken firom the fire. 

Apples, 7 lbs. ; water, 7 pints : i to frill hour. Juice, 6 lbs. : 20 
minutes quick boiling. Sugar, 4 lbs. : 10 to 25 minutes. Juice three 
lemons. 



EXOEEDXNGLT FINE APPLB JELLT. 

Pare quickly some highly flayoured juic^ apples of any kind, or of 
Tarious kinds together, for this is immaterial ; slice, without diyiding 
them ; but first free them from the stalks and eyes ; shake out some 
of the pips, and put the apples eyenly into yery clean large stone 
jars, just dipping an occasional layer mto cold water as this is done, 
the better to preserye the colour of the whole. Set the jars into pans 
of water, and Doil the fruit slowly until it is quite sofi;, then turn it 
into a jelly-bag or doth and let the iiuce all drop from it. The 
quantity which it will haye yielded will be small, but it will be dear 
and rich. Weigh, and boil it for ten minutes, then draw it from the 
fire, and stir into it, until it is entirely dissolyed, twdye ounces of 
good sugar to the pound and quarter (or pint) of juice. Place the 
preserye again oyer the fire and stir it without intermission, except to 
clear off the scum, until it has boiled fh)m eight to ten minutes longer,, 
for otherwise it will jelly on the surface with the scum upon it, wMch 
it will then be difficult to remoye, as when touched it will break and 
fall into the preserye. The strained juice of one small fresh lemon 
to the pint of jelly should be thrown into it two or three minutes 
before it is poured out, and the rind of one or two cut yery thin may 
be simmered in the juice before the sugar is added ; but the pale, 
delicate colour of the jeUy will be injurod by too much of it, and 
many persons would alt<>gether prefer the pure flayour of the 
fruit. 

Juice of apples, 1 quart, or 2^ lbs. : 10 minutes. Sugar, 1^ lb. : 
8 to 10 minutes. Juice, 2 small lemons; rind of 1 or more at 
pleaswe.

Oftt.^The quantity of apples reqnired for it renders this a ratber 
expensive preserve, where they are not abundant ; but it is a remark- 
ably fine jelly, and turns out from the moulds in perfect shape lod 
very firm.* It mav be served in the second course, or for dessert 
It is sometimes made without paring the apples, or dipping them into 
the water, and the colour is then a deep red : we have occasionaUy 
1^ a pint of water added to about a pallon and a half of applea» but 
the jelly was not then quite so fine m flavour. The best time for 
making it ib from the end of November to Christmas. Quince jelly 
would, without doubt, be very fine made by this receipt; but as the 
juice of Uiat fruit is richer than that of the apple, a little water 
might be added. Alternate layers of apples and quinces would 
also answer well, we think. 

QUINCB JELLY. 

Fare, quarter, core, and weigh some ripe but quite sound quinoei^ 
as quickly as possible, and throw them as they are done into part of 
the water in which they are to be boiled, as directed at page 456 ; 
allow one pint of this to each pound of the fruit, and simmer it gently 
until it is a little broken, but not so lonff as to redden the juice, whin 
ought to be very pale. Turn the whole into a jelly-bag, or strain 
the liquid througn a fine doth, and let it drain very doeely from it 
but without the slightest pressure. Weigh the juice, put it into a deli- 
catel]^ dean preserving pan, and boil it quickly for twen^ minutes; 
take it from the fire and stir in it, until it is entirely dissolved, twelve 
ounces of suear for each pound of juice, or fourteen ounces if the 
fruit should DC very acid, which it will be in the earlier part of the 
season ; keep it constantly stirred and thoroughl v cleared from scum, 
ftx>m ten to twenty minutes longer, or until it jellies strongly in iall- 
iug from the skimmer ; then pour it directly into glasses or moulds. 
If properly made, it will be suffidently firm to turn out of the latter, 
and it will be beautifully transparent, and rich in flavour. It may 
be made with an equal weight of juice and sugar mixed together in 
the first instance, and boil^ frY>m twenty to thirty minutes. It if 
difficult to state the time precisely, because from difierent causes it 
will varv much. It should be reduced rapidly to the proper point, 
as long boilinff injures the colour : this is alwavs more perfectly pre- 
served by boiOng the juice without the sugar nrst. 

To each pound paj^ and cored quinces, 1 pint water: | to 1| 
hour. Juice, boiled 20 minutes. To each pound, 12 oz. sugar: 
10 to 20 minutes. Or, juice and sugar equal weight : 20 to 90 
minutes. 

QUINCE MARMALADE.

what eaUbnited.

quarter some of the inferior quinces, and boil them in as much water 
as will nearly cover them, until they begin to break ; strain the juice 
from them, and for the marmalade put half a pint of it to each pound 
of fresh quinces : in preparing these, be careful to cut out the hard 
stony parts round the cores. Simmer them gently until they are 
perfectly tender, then press them, with the jiuce, through a coarse 
sieTe ; put them into a perfectly clean pan, and boU them until they 
form almost a dry paste ; add ror each poimd of (quinces and the half 
pint of juice, three-ouarters of a pound' of sugar m fine powder, and 
b^ the marmalade for half an hour, stirring it gently without ceas- 
ing : it will be vexr firm and bright in colour. If made shortly 
after the fruit is gathered, a little additional sugar will be required ; 
and when a richer and less dry marmalade is b^ter liked, it must be 
boiled for a shorter time, and an equal weight of fruit and sugar may 
be used. 

Quinces, pared and cored, 4 lbs. ; prepared juice, 1 quart : 2 to 3 
hours. Boiled fast to dry, 20 to 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. ; 30 
minutes. 

Eicher marmalade : quinces, 4 lbs. ; juice, 1 quart ; sugar, 4 lbs. 

QUINCE AND APPLE MARMALADE. 

Boil together, from three-quarters of an hour to an hour, two 
pounds of pearmains, or of any other well-flayoured apples, in an 
equal weieht of prepared quince-juice (see page 4^6), then take them 
from the nre, and mix with them a pound and a half of su^, in fine 
powder ; when this is a little dissolved, set the pan again over a 
iikk fiore, and boil the preserve for twenty minutes longer, keeping 
it stirred dl the time. 

Prepared quince-juice, 2 lbs. ; apples, 2 lbs. : } to 1 hour. Sugar, 
l)lb. : 20mmutes. 

QUINCE PASTE. 

If the full flavour of the quinces be desured, stew them sufficiently 
tender to press through a sieve, in the prepared juice of page 456, 
otherwise, in just water enough to about three parts cover them ; 
when they are soft quite through lift them out, let them cool, and 
then pass them through a sieve; reduce them to a dry paste over a 
very dear fire, and stir them constantly ; then weigh the fruit, and 
twJT it with an equal proportion of pounded sugar, or sugar boiled to 
candy height (we find the effect nearly the same, whichever method 
be pursued), and stir the paste without intermission until it is again 
80 dry as to quit the pan and adhere to the spoon in one lai^ ball; 
press it into shallow pans or dishes ; cut it, as soon as cold, into small 
squares, and should they seem to require it, dry them with a very 
gentle degree of heat, and when they are again cold store them in tin

Take the finest barberries without stones that can be procured ,t]e 
them together in bunches of four or five sprigrs, and for each half 
pound of the firuit (which is extremely light), boil one pound ofyery 
ffood sugar in a pint of water for twenty minutes, and dear it weU 
from scum ; throw in the fhut, let it heat genUy, and then boil firom 
five to seven minutes, when it will be perftcUy transparent. So long 
as any snapping noise is heard the fruit is not all done ; it should be 

Eressed equally down into the syrup until the whole of the berries 
ave burst; and should then be turned into jars, which must be 
covered with skin or two or three folds of thid^ paper, as soon as the 
preserve is perfectly cold. The barberries thus prepared make a 
beautiAil garnish for sweet dishes, or for puddings.

Strip the firuit from the stems, wash it in sj^ring-water, drain, 
bruise it slightly, and put it into a dean stone jar, with no more 
liquid than Uie orops which hanor about it. Place the jar in a pan of 
water, and steam the fruit until it is quite tender : this will be in 
firom thir^ minutes to an hour. Pour off the clear juice, strain, 
weigh, and boil it quickly from five to seven minutes, with eighteen

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

(A Portttguese Receipt) 

Basp very slightly on a fine and delicately dean grater the linds of 
some sound Seville oranges; cut them into quarters, and separate the 
flesh from the rinds ; then with the small end of a tea, or ^;gspoon, 
dear it entirely from the pips, and from the loose inner skin and film. 
Put the linds mto a large quantity of cold water, and change it when 
they have boiled about twenty minutes. As soon as they are per- 
fectly tender lift them out, and drain them on a sieve ; slice them 
thin, and add dght ounces of them to each pound of the pulp and 
Juice, with a pound and a half of highly-refined su^ in fine powder ; 
boil the marmalade quickly for half an hour, skim it well, and turn it 
into the jars. The preserve thus made will not have a very pow-

leave a portion of the fruit nnrasped, or mix with the inreserve i 
of the zest whidi has heen grated off, allowing for it its weight of 
snsar. Or proceed thus : auow to a dozen Seville oranges two fine 
juicv lemons, and the weight of the whole in sifted sugar, of ezoeDent 
quality. WiUi a sharp Imife cut through the rinds just deep enough 
to allow them to he stripped off in quarters with the end or a spoon, 
and throw them for a night into plenty of cold spring-water ; on ^ 
following morning hoil them sufficiently tender to aUow the head of 
a pin to pierce them easily ; then drain them well, let them cool, and 
scrape ouf tiie white ^rt of the rind, and cut the remainder into thin 
chips. In the mean time have the pulp of the fruit quite cleared from 
the pips and film ; put it vdth the chips into a preserving pan, heat 
them slowly, boil them for ten minutes, draw the pan from the fire, 
and stir gradually in, and dissolve the remainder of the sugar, and 
boil the preserve more quickly for twenty minutes, or until it thickens 
and appears ready to jelly. This mode, though it gives a little ad- 
ditional trouble, will ]prevent the orange-chips from becoming hard, 
whidi they will sometunes be if much sugar be added to them at 
first. The sugar first broken into large Imnps, is sometimes made into 
a very thidc syrup, with so much water only as will just dissolve it ; 
the pulp and juice are in that case boil^ in it quickly for ten 
minutes before the chips are added ; and a part of these are pounded 
and stirred into the preserve with the others. March is the proper 
month for making this preserve, the Seville oranges being iJien in 
perfection. For lemon marmalade proceed exactly in the same 
manner as for this. 

Rinds of Seville oranges, lightly rasped and boiled tender, 2 IbsL ;

OENUINB SCOTCH MARMALADE. 

" Take some bitter oranges, and double their weight of sugar ; cot 
the rind of the fruit into quarters and peel it off, and if the marma- 
lade be not wanted very thick, take off some of the spongy white 
skin inside the rind. Cut the chips as thin as pjoesible, and about half 
an inch lone, and divide the pulp into small bits, removing carefully 
the seeds, which may be steeped m part of the water that is to make 
the marmalade, and which must be m the proportion of a quart to a 
pound of fruit. Put the chips and pulp into a deep earthen dish, and 
pour the water boiling over them ; let them remain for twelve or 
fourteen hours, and then turn the whole into the preserving pan, and 
boil it until the chips are perfecUy tender. When they are so, add 
by degrees the sugar (which should be previously pounded), and boiL 
It until it jellies, llie water in which the seeds have been steeped, 
and which must be taken from the quantity apportioned to the whole 
of the preserve, should be poured into a hair-sieve, and the seeds weli

CLEAR ORANGE MARMALADE. 
(Author's Receipt) 

This, especially for persons in delicate health, is far more whole- 
tome than the marmalade which contains chips of the orange-rinds. 
The fruit must be prepared in the same manner, and the pulp very 
carefully cleared from the pips and skin. The rinds taken off in 
quarters (after having been washed and wiped quite clean from tho 
black sou which is sometimes found on them), must be boiled 
extremely tender in a large quantity of water, into which they may 
be thrown when it boils. They should be wdl drained upon a large 
hair sieve reversed, so soon as the head of a pin -mil pierce them 
easily ; and the white skin and fibres shoula be scraped entirely 
from them while they are still warm. They should then be pounded 
to a paste, and well blended with the pulp and juice, these being added 
to them by degrees, that they may not remain in lumps. A quarter of 
a pint of water, in which the seeds have been immersed for an hour 
or two, weU worked up with them, and then passed through a net 
strainer* or coarse sieve, will soften the flavour of the marmalade, and 
assist its jellying at the same time. Boil it rather quickly without 
sugar for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, then finish it by 
the directions for " Orange Marmalade, Portuguese Receipt,** of the 
preceding page, but regulate the proportion of sugar and the time 
of boiling as follows : — 

Pulp and juice of Seville oranges, 1| lb.; water stramed from 
inps, i pint; pounded orange-rinds f lb. : 15 to 20 minutes. Sugar, 
2f lb. (3 lb. if the fruit should be very acid), half added first, 10 to 
15 minutes; with remaining half, 15 to 20 minutes, or until the 
marmalade becomes quite thick and dear. 

CH>s —-We have occasionally had more water than the proportion 
eiven above used in making this preserve, which is very nice 
m flavour, but which may be made to suit various tastes by adding a 
larger or smaller quantity of the rinds ; and a larger weight of sugar 
when it is liked very sweet. When the bitterness of the fruit is 
objected to, the rinds may be steeped for a night in a plentiM 
quantity of spring water. 

• Strainers of coarse bobbin-net, which is very cheap, are preferable to mnalia 
for preparations which are jeUied, as the water becomes thick when the orange* 
seeds are steeped in it.

Altliougb yre hxve appropriated this receipt to another work, m 
cannot refrain from inserting it here as well, so delidona to oor 
taste is the jelly which we have had made hy it. For eighteen foA- 
sized oranges allow a pint and a half of water. Take off the rinds in 
quarters from ten of them, and then free them entirely frx>m their 
tough white skin, and with a sharp knife cut ihem into ratho' Untk

remainder of the fruit without pariiu^ it, and squeeze the jmoe and 
pips, hut not ihe ptdp, to the sliced oranges ; and place them by 
the fire in an enamelled stewpan which they will not more than two- 
thirds fill. Heat and boil them gently between twenty and thirty 
minutes, then strain the juice closely from them without pressure^ 
through a large square of muslin folded in four, or, if more oon- 
yenient, pass it first through a yery thin and ddicately dean doth, 
and afterwards through the folded muslin. Weigh and bool it 
quickly for fiye minutes ; then for each pound stir gradually to it 
lourteen ounces of highly refined sugar, broken small or roughly 
powdered; and when it is quite dissolyed, continue the boiling u»r a 
few minutes longer, when tne preserye will jelly easily andSrmly,

ment. The jelly in both instances was made, we oelieye, in A^il^ 
when the fruit was faHy ripe : earlier in the season it would mo- 
bably reauire longer boiling. On one occasion it became quite mm 
very quickly after the sugar was added to the juice ; that is to say, in

Mango. 
OBSERVATIONS ON PICKLBS. 

With the exception of walnuts,* which, when softened by keeping'^ 
or by the mode of preparing them, are the least objectionable of any 
picWle, with Indian mangoes, and one or two other varieties, these 
are not very wholesome articles of diet,t consisting, as so many of 
them do, of crude hard yegetables, or of unripe fruit. In numerous 
instances, too, those which are commonly sold to the public have 
been found of so deadly a nature as to be emmently dangerous Uy 
-penoua who partake of them often and lamly. It is most de- 
sirable, therefore, to have them prenared at home, and with good 
genuine vinegar, whether French or English. That which is home- 
made can at least be relied on ; and it may be made of excellent 
quality and of su£Scient strength for all ordinary purposes. The 
superiority of French vinegar results from its being made of wine; 
no substitute producing any equal to that derived from the unmixed 
juice of the grape In our next page will be found the address of

the importers, from whom, or whose ageats, we haye for tevenl 
yean been supplied with it. 

Pickles should always be kept quite ooTered with their liaaor, and 
well secured from the air and from the influence of damp; tne last of 
which is especially detrimental to them We can quite recommend to 
the reader the rather limited number of receipts which follow, and 
which mif;ht easily be multiplied did the sixe of our volume pmniL 
Pickling IS so easy a process, howerer, that when in any degree pro- 
perly acquired, it may be extended to almost eveiy kind of f rait and 
Y^^ble Buocessfnlly. A few of the choicer kinds will neverthdess 
be found generally more acceptable than a greater Tariety of in- 
ferior preparations. Mushrooms, gherkins, walnuts, lemons, escha- 
lots, and peaches, for all of which we have given minute dimtions, 
will furnish as much choice as is commonly required. Very ex- 
cellent Indian mangoes too may be purchased at the Italian ware- 
houses, and to many tastes will be more acceptable than any "Rn giiMh 
pickle. We have nad them very ffood from Mr. Gobbett, Is/jPall 
Mall, whose house we have already nad occasion to name more than 
once. 



TO PICKLE OHBRRIES. 

Leave about an inch of their stalks on some fine, sound Kentiaih or 
Flenush cherries, which are not over ripe ; put them into ajar, eover 
them with cold vinegar, and let them stand for three weeks; pour c^ 
two-thirds of the liouor and replace it with fresh vinegar; tiien, ater 
having drained it mm the fruit, boil the whole wiSi an ounce of 
coriander seed, a small blade of mace, a few grains of cayenne, or a 
teaspoonM of white peppercorns, and four bruised cochineals to 
every quart, all tied loosely in a fold of muslin. Let the picUe 
become quite cold before it is added to the cherries : in a month th^ 
will be nt for use. The vinesar which is poured from the fruit 
makes a good s^p of itself^ men boiled with a pound of sugar to 
the pint, but it is improved by having some fresh raspberries, 
cherries, or currants previously infused in it for three or four 
days. 

TO PICKLB OHEBKDfB. 

Let the gherkins be gathered on a dry day, before the frost has 
touched them ; take off the blossoms, put them into a stone jar, and 
pour over them sufficient boiling brme to cover them weu. Hie 
following daj take them out, wipe them singly, lay them into a dean 
stone jar, with a dozen baj^ leaves over them, and pour upon them 
the following pickle, when it is boiling fast : as much vin^ar as w31 
more than cover the gherkins by an inch or two, with an ounce and 
a quarter of salt, a quarter-ounce of black peppercorns^ an ounce 



CHAP, xxv.] PICKLES. 533 

and a half of ginger sliced, or slightly bruised, and two small blades 
gf maoe to every quart ; put a ^ate over the jar, and leave it for 
two days, then drain off the vinegar, and heat it afresh ; when it 
boils, throw in the gherkins, and Iceep them just on the point of 
mmmering for two or three minutes; pour the whole bade mto the 
jar, put the plate aeun upon it, and let it remain until the pidde is 
<{uite cold, when a &in, or two separate folds of thick brown paper, 
must be tied closely over it. The gherkins thus mckled are very 
crisp, and excellent in flavour, and ue colour is sufficiently good to 
satisfy the prudent housekeeper, to whom the brilliant and poisonous 
green produced by boiliii^ tne vin^;ar in a brass skillet (a process 
eonstantly recommended in books of cookerv) is anything but attrac- 
tive. To satisfy ourselves of the effect produced b^ the action of the 
add on the metal, we had a fsw gherkms thrown into some vinegar 
which was boiling iu a brass pan, and nothing could be more beauti- 
fal than the colour which they almost immediately exhibited. We 
fear this dancerous method is too often resorted to in preparing 
pickles for sale. 

Brine to pour on gherkins :— 6 oz. salt to each quart water : 24 
hours. Pickle: — ^to each quart vinegar, salt, li oz.; black pepper- 
corns, i oz. ; ginger, sliced or bruised^ 1^ oz. ; mace, 2 small blades ; 
bay leaves ; 24 to 100 gherkins, more when the flavour is liked : 2 
daya Gherkins simmered in vinegar, 2 to 3 minutes. 

Obs,— The quantity of vin^;ar required to cover the gherkins will 
be shown by that of the brine : so much depends upon their 8ize» 
that it is impossible to direct the measure exactly. A larger pro- 
portion of spice can be added at pleasure. 

TO PIOKLB GHERKIKS. 

(A French Beceipt.) 

Brush or wipe the gherkins very dean, throw them into plenty of 
fast-boiling water, a^ ^ve them a single boil, take tnem out 
quickly, and throw them mmiediatdy into a lam quantity of veiy 
cold water ; diange it once, and when the gherkins themselves are 

Suite cold, drain Uiem well, spread them on sieves or dishes, and dry 
bem in the air. When this is done, put them into stone jars, ana 
pour on them as much boiling vinegar as will cover them well ; heat 
It anew, and pour^it on them a^^ the following da^ ; and on the 
next throw them into it for a mmute so soon as it boils, with plenty 
of tarragon in branches, a few very small silver onions, and salt and 
whole pepper in the same proportions as in the receipt above. It 
should DC observed that the French vinegar, from its superior excel- 
lence, will have a very different effect, in many preparations, to that 
whidi is made up for sale generaUy m England *

TO PICKLB PEACHBBy AKD PBACH 1U1T00B8, 

Take, at their full growth, just before they b^^ to ripen, aiz 
larse or eight modente-sized peaches ; wipe Uie down firom them, 
and put them into brine that will float an egg. In three days let 
them be taken out, and drained on a sieye reyeraed for seyeral nours. 
Boll in a quart of yin^gar for ten minutea two ounces of whole white 
pepper, two of ginger slightly bruised, a teaspoonful of salt, two 
blaaes of maoe, half a pound of mustard-aeed, and a half-teaspoonful 
'Of cayenne tied in a bit of muslin. Lay the peaches into a jar, and 
pour the boiling pickle on them: in two months they will be fit for 
use. 

Feachea, 6 or 8 : in brine three days. Yin^iar, 1 quart ; whole 
white pepper, 2 os. ; bruiaed ginger, 2 oz. : aalt, 1 teaspoonful ; mace^ 
^ bladea; mustard-seed^ k lb : 10 minutes. 

Ob4. — ^The peaches may be conyerted into excellent mangoes by 
cutting out from the stalk-end of each, a round of sufficient size to 
allow the stone to be extracted : this should be done after they are 
taken firom the brine. They may be filled with very fresh mustard- 
aeed, preyiously washed in a little yin^;ar ; to this a small portion of 
.garlic, or bruised eschalots, cayenne, horse-radish, chilies ^the moat 
^propriate of any), or spioe of any kind may be added, to the taste. 
The part cut out must be replaced, and secured with a xMckthread 
.aroased oyer the fruit. 

6WEET PICKLE OF MELON. (FOREIGN RECEIPT.) 

(To serve wUh Roast Meat.) 

Take, within three or four days of their being flilly ripe, one o^ 
two weU-flayoured melons; just pare off the outer rind, dear them 
firom the seeds, and cut them into slices of about half an inch thick ; 
lay them into good yinegar, and let them remain in it for ten days ; 
then coyer them with cold fbesh yinegar, and simmer them yeiy 
^ntly until they are tender. Lift them on to a sieye reyersed, to 
drain, and when they are quite cold stick a couple of cloyes into each 
alice, lay them into a jar (a glass one, if at hand) and coyer them 
well with cold syrup, made with ten ounces of sugar to the pint of 
water, boiled quickly together for twenty minutes. In about a week 
<take them from the syrup, let it drain from them a little, then put 
them into jars in which tney are to be stored, and coyer them again 
thoroughly with good yinegar, which has been bcnled for an instant» 
and left to heoome quite cold before it ia added to them.

This pickle is intended to be serred more particularly with roast 
mutton, hare, and venison, instead of currant jeUy, but it is very 
sood with Btewed meat also. Small blades of cinnamon, and a 
&rger proportion of cloves are sometimes stuck into the mdon, but 
their flavour should not prevail too strongly. We have found the 
receipt answer extremely well as we have given it, when tried with 
small green melons, cut within four days of being fit for table. 

Melons not quite ripe, pared irom hard rind and sliced, 1 or 2 : in 
vin^;ar 10 days. Simmered in it until tender. In syrup 6 to 7 
days. In fresh vinegar to remain. Ready to serve in a month. 

A Common Sweet Pickle of Melon. — Prepare the fruit as above. 
In a fortnight simmer it imtil tender ; drain, and lay it into jars, and 
pour on it while just warm, a pickle made with a pound and two 
ounces of coarse brown sugar, twenty doves, and half a drachm of 
cinnamon to the pint of vinegar, boiled together for ten minutes. 

TO PICKLE MUSHBOOHS. 

Select for this purpose the smallest buttons of the wild meadow 
mushrooms, in prderence to those which are artificially raised, and 
let them be as freshly gathered as possible. Cut the stems off quite 
dose, and dean them with a bit of new flannd slightly moistened, 
and dipped into fine salt ; throw them as they are £>ne into plenty 
of spnng-water, mixed with a large spoonful of salt, but drain them 
&om it quickly afterwards, and lay them into a soft doth to dry, or 
the moisture which hangn about them will too much weaken the 
pickle. For each quart of the mushrooms thus prepared, take nearly 
a quart of the palest white wine vinegar (this is iar superior to the 
distilled vinegar generally used for the purpose, and the variation in 
the colour of the mushrooms will be very slight), and add to it a 



heaped teaspoonfal of salt, half an ounce of whole white pepper, an 
oxmce of ginger, sliced or slightly bruised, about the fourtn of a 
saltspoonfiil of cayenne tied in a small bit of muslin, and two large 
blades of mace : to these may be added half a small nutmeg, sliced, 
but too much spice will entirely overpower the fine natural flavour 
of the mushrooms. When the pickle boils throw them in, and boil 
them in it over a dear fire moderatdy fast fhun six to nine minutes, 
or somewhat lon^per, should they not be very smaU. When they are 
much disproportioned in size, the larger ones should have two 
minutes boil before the others are thrown into the vinegar. As soon 
as they are tolerably tender, put them at once into small stone jars, 
or into warm wide«necked bottles, and divide the spice equally 
amongst them. The followinj^ day, or as soon as they are perfectly 
cold, secure them firom the air with lar^e corks, or tie skins and 
paper over them. They should be stored in a dry place, and guarded 
&om severe frost When the colour of the mushrooms is more oon- 
ndered than the excellence of the pidde, the distilled vinegar can be 
used for it. The reader may rely upon this receipt as a really good

Mushroom battons (without the stems), 2 quarts; palest white 
wine vinegar, short i gallon; salt, lar^e dessertspoonfiu, or 1^ oa.; 
white nepperoorns, 1 oz. ; whole ginger, 2 oz. ; cayenne, small i salt- 
spoonful ; 1 small nutm^^. 

MUSHROOMS IN BRnTE. 

For WinUr Use. (Very Good.) 

We have had small mushroom-buttons excellently preserved 
through the winter prepared as follows, and we therefore give the 
exact proportions which we had used for them, though tne same 
quantity of brine would possibly allow of rather more mushrooms in 
It Prepare them exactly as for the preceding pickle, and measure 
them after the stems are taken off. For each quart, boil tc^eAer for 
five minutes two ouarts of water, with half a pound of common 
white salt, a small oessertspoonful of white pepnercoms, a couple of 
Uades of mace, and a race of ginger ; take on the scum thoroughly, 
and throw in the mushrooms; boil them gently for about five 
minutes, then put them into well-warmed, wide-necked bottles, and 
let them become perfectly cold ; pour a little good salad-oil on the 
top, cork them with new corks, and tie bladder over, or cover them 
with two separate bladders. When wanted for use, soak the modi- 
rooms in warm water until the brine is suffidentlv extracted. 

Mushrooms, 1 quart; water, i eallon; salt, \ lb.; pepperoons, 
1 small dessertspoonful ; mace, 2 bhides ; ginger, 1 race : 6 minutes. 
Mushrooms, in brine : 6 minutes. 

TO PICKLE WALNI7TS. 

The walnuts for this pickle must be gathered while a pin can 
pierce them eon/y, for when once the shell can be felt, they have 
ceased to be in a proper st ibr it Make sufficient brine to cover 
them well, with six ounces of salt to the quart of water ; take off the 
scum, which will rise to the surface as the salt dissolves, throw in the 
walnuts, and stir them night and morning; change the brine every 
three days, and if they are wanted for immediate eating, leave them 
in it for twelve days ; otherwise, drain them from it in nine, spread 
them on dishes, and let them remain exposed to the air until they 
become black : this will be in twelve hours, or less. Make a pckJe 
for them with something more than half a eallon of vinegar to the 
hundred, a teaspoonfiil of salt, two ounces of black pepper, three of 
bruised ginser, a drachm of mace, and from a quarter to half an 
ounce of cloves (of which some may be stuck mto three or four 
small onions), and four ounces of mustard-seed. Boil the whole of 
these together for about five minutes ; have the walnuts ready in a 



CHAP. ZZY.] PICKLES. 637 

stone jar or jars, and pour it on them as it is taken from the fire* 
"When the pickle is quite cold, cover the jar securely, and store it in 
a dry place. Keep the walnuts always well oover^l witii Tinegar, 
and ooil that whicn is added to them.

1 drachm; cloves, i to i oz.; sinall onions, 4 to 6; mustard-seed, 
4 oz. : 6 minutes. 

TO FICELB BEET-ROOT. 

Boil the beet-root tender by the directions of page 829, and when 
it is quite cold, pare and slice it ; put it into a jar, and cover it with 
yinc^ previously boiled and allowed to bea>me again perfectly cold : 
it wiU soon be ready for use. It is excellent when merely covered 
with chili vine^. A few small shalots may be boiled in the pickle 
for it when their flavour is liked. Carrots boiled tolerably tender in 
salt and water may be prepared by this receipt with or without the 
addition of the shalots, or with a iew very small silver onions, which 
should be boiled for a minute or two in the pickle : this should be 
poured hot on the carrots. 

To each quart of vinegar, salt, 1 teaspoonful ; cayenne tied in 
mualin, \ saltspoonfid, or white peppercorns, i to whole oz. 

PICKLED ESCHALOTS. 

(iltiMorV Beceipt.) 

For a quart of readjr-peeled eschalots, add to the same quantihr of 
the best pale white wine vinegar, a dessertspoonful of salt, and an 
ounce of whole white pepner ; oring these quickly to a boil, take off 
the scum, throw in the escnalots, simmer them for two minutes only, 
turn them into a dean stone jar, and when they are quite cold, tie a 
skin, or two folds of thick paper over it. 

Eschalots, 1 quart; vinegar, 1 quart; salt, 1 dessertspoonfbl ; 
whole white pepper, 1 oz. 

(76«.— The sooner the eschalots are pickled after they are ripe and 
dry, the better they will be. 

PICBXED ONIONS. 

Take the smallest onions that can be procured,* lust afler they are 
harvested, for they are never in so good a state for the purpose as 
then ; proceed, after having peeled then^ exactly as for the escnalots, 
and when they begin to look clear, which will be in three or four 
minutes, put them into jars, and pour the pickle on them. The 
* The Beading onion is the proper kind for pickling.

Tinegar should be yexy pale, and their colour will then be ezoeed- 
ingly well preserved. Any j&yourite apioes can be added to it. 

TO PICKLE LEHONSy AND LIMES. 
{Excdient.) 

"Wipe eight fine sound lemons very dean, and make, at equal dis- 
tances, four deep incisions in each, from the stalk to the blossom end, 
but without diYiding the fruit ; stuff them with as much salt as they 
will contain, lay them into a deep dish, and place them in a sunny 
window, or in some warm place for a week or ten days, keeping them 
often turned and basted with their own liquor ; then rub them with 
flome good pale turmeric, and put them with their juice, into a stone 
jar with a small head of garlic, divided into cloves and peeled, uid a 
dozen small onions stuck with twice as many cloves. Boil in two 
quarts of white wine vinegar, half a pound of ginger slightly bruised, 
two ounces of whole bli^ pepper, and hair a pound of mustud- 
seed ; take them from the fire and pour them directly on the lemons; 
•cover the jar with a plate, and let them remaiu until the following 
day, then add to the pickle half a dozen capsicums (or a few chilies, 
if more convenient), and tie a skin and a fold of thick paper over the 
jar. 

Lai]^ lemons stuffed with salt, 8 : 8 to 10 days. Turmeric, 1 to 2 
oz. ; ginger, ^ lb. ; mustard-seed, i lb. ; capsicums, 6 oz. 

OSs, — The turmeric and garlic may, we think, be omitted from 
this pickle with advantage. It will remain good for seven years if 
the lemons be kept well covered with vin^;ar : that which is added 
to them should be boiled and then left till cold before it is poured into 
the jar. They will not be fit for table in less than twelve months ; 
but if wanted for more immediate use, set them for one night into a 
very cool oven : they may then be eaten almost directly. 

Limes must have but slight incisions made in the rinds ; and iher 
will be sufficiently softened in four or five days. Two ounces of salt 
only will be required for half a dozen; and all which remains un- 
melted must, with their juice, be put into the jar with them before 
the vinegar is poured on : this should be mixed with spice and mus- 
tard-seed, and be boiling when it is added to the limes. 

LEMON MANGOES. 

(Au^or^s Original Reeeijd.) 

All pickles of vegetables or fruit which have been emptied and 
filled with various ingredients, are called in England mangoes^ having 
probably first been prepared in imitation of that fruit, but none that 
we have ever tasted, bearing the slightest resemblance to it. Young 
tnelons, laige cucumbers, vegetable-mairow, and peaches are aU 



OKAF. XXT.] PIGKLE& 639 

thus dengnated wben preoared as we have deseribed. Lemons may 
be converted into an excellent pickle of liie same description in the 
following manner. 

After naying removed firom the blossom end of each a drcnlar bit 
of the rind abont the size of a shilling, proceed to scoop out all the 
pnlp and skin with the handle of a teaspoon ; rinse the insides of the 
rinos until the water from them is clear ; throw them into plenty of 
brine made with half a pound of salt to two quarts of water, and stir 
them down in it often during the time. In three days change the 
brine, and leave them for t&ee days longer ; then drain them from 
it on a sieve, fill them with bruised or whole mustard-seed, very 
small chilies, young scraped horse-radish, very small eschalots, a 
little ginger sliced thin, or aught else that may be liked. Sew in the 
parts that have been cut out, lay the lemons into a stone jar, and 

Stur boiling on them a pickle made of their own juice, which when 
ey are fint emptied should be squeezed from the pulp through a 
doth, and boiled with suffident vinegar to keep it, — a huge salt- 
epoonful of salt, half an ounce each of ginger and of white pepper- 
corns, and a blade or two of mace to every quBit ; or prepare them 
like Uie whole lemons, omitting the turmenc ; and soften them if 
wanted for immediate eating as directed for them. They may be 
filled simply with mustard-seed, horse-radish, and spice, if pre- 
ferred so. 

This receipt has been in print before, but without the author's 
name. 

TO PICKLE NABTURTIUMS. 

These should be gathered quite young, and a portion of the buds, 
when very small, should be mixed with them. Prepare a pickle by 
disBolving an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of pale vinerar, and 
throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to day. Tney are 
used instead of capers for sauce, and by some persons are preferred 
to them. When purchased for pickling, put them at once into a jar, 
and cover them well with the vinegar. 

TO PICKLE RED CABBAGE. 

Strip off the outer leaves, wipe, and slice a fine sound cabbage or 
two extremely thin, sprinkle plenty of salt over them, and let them 
drain in a sieve, or on a strainer for twelve hours or more ; shake or 
press the moisture from them ; put them into dean stone jars, and 
cover them toell with cold vinegar, in which an ounce of black pepper 
to the quart has been boiled. Some persons merely cover the

CHAPTER XXVL 




Modem Cake Mould. 
GENERAL RRMABK8 ON GAKBB. 

ffm hare inserted here bat a comparatively 
limited number of receipts for these ^^ tweet 
paisotu,** as they have been emphatically called, 
and we would willingly have diminished still 
further eren the space which has been allotted 
to them, that we might have had room in their 
stead for others of a more really useM cha- 
racter ; but we have felt reluctant to withdraw 
such a portion of any of the chapters as might ^^^^ ^ ^'"^ 
materially alter the original character of &e work, or cause dis- 
satisfaction to any of our kind readers ; we will therefore content 
ourselves with remarking, that more illness is caused by halutual 
indulgence in the richer and heavier kinds of cakes than would 
easily be credited by persons who have given no attention to the 
subject 




CBAP. zxyl] cakes. 511 

Amongst those which have the worst effects are almond* and 
-ptam pound cakes, as they are called; all varieties of the brioche; 
and such others as contain a large quantity of batter and eggs. 

The least objectionable are simple bims, biscnits, yeast and sponge 
cakes, and fneringuet; these last being extremely light and delicate, 
and made of white of egg and sngar only, are really not un- 
wholesome. 

The ingredients for cakes, as well as for puddixigs, should all be 
firesh and good, as well as free from damp ; the lightness of many 
kinds depends entirely on that given to the eggs by whisking, and by 
the manner in which the whole is mixed. A nndu portion of carbo- 
nate of soda, which will not be in the slightest desree perceptible to 
the taste after the cake is baked, if thrown in just before the mixture 
IB put into the oven, will ensure its rising weU. 

To guard against the bitterness so often imparted by yeast when it 
is used for cakes or biscuits, it should be sparinglyjMe^ and the 
sponge should be left twice ihe usual time to rise. This method wUl 
be found to answer equally with bread. For example : should a 
couple of spoonsful of yeast be ordered in a receipt, when it is bitter, 
use but one, and let it stand two hours instead of half the time : the 
fermentation, though slow, will be quite as perfect as if it were more 
quickly effected, and the cake or loaf thus made will not become 
dry by any means as soon as if a larger portion of yeast were mixed 
With it. 

The German yeast when firesh is preferable to any other for 
all light cakes, being made without hops and theiefore never 
bitter. 

All light cakes require a rather brisk oven to raise and set them ; 
Tery lai^ rich ones a well-sustained d^ree of heat sufficient to bake 
them through ; and small sugar-cakes a slow oven, to prevent their 
taking a deep colour before they are half done : ffinferbread, too, 
should be gently baked, unless it be of the light tnick kind. Me- 
ringues, macaroons, and ratafias, will bear a uight degree more of 
heat than these. 

For sponge and savoy cakes the moulds should be thickly and 
evenly buttered, and fine siigar shaken in them until thevare equally 
oovei^ with it : the loose sugar must be turned out before they are 
used. 

To ascertain whether a cake be done, thrust a lardinf needle or 
brk^ht skewer into the centre, and should this come out dean, draw 
it from the oven directly; but should the paste adhere to it, continue 
the iMking. Sevend sheets of paper are placed usually under large 
plum-cakes. 

Cakes are rendered heavy by moving or shaking them after they 
have risen in the oven, and before they have b«»>me firm. They 
should be gently loosened and turned from the moulds when suf- 
ficiently baked and set for a short time just at the mouth of the oven 
to dry the surface, then laid upon their sides on a sieve until cold.

TO BLAKOH AND TO FOTINB ALMONDS. 

Pat them into a saaoepan with plenty of cold water, and heat it 
filowly ; when it is just scalding torn the almonds into a basin, peel, 
and throw them into cold water as they are done : dry them well in 
a soft cloth before they are used. If the water be too hot it will 
turn them yellow. 

Almonds are more easily pounded, and less liable to become oily, if 
dried a little in a very gentle degree of heat after they are blanched ; 
left, for example, in a warm room for two or three days, lightly 
spread on a large dish or tin. They should be sprinkled during the 
' beating with a few drops of cold water, or white of egg, or lemon- 
juice, and poimded to a smoolh paste : this is more easily done, we 
believe, when they are first roughly chopped, but we prefer to ba,Y9 
them thrown at once into the mortar. 

TO BBDUCB ALHOKDS TO A PASTE. 

(2^ qukkut and tamest way^ 

Chop them a little on a larpe and very dean trencher, then with a 
paste roller (roUing-pn), which ou^ht to be thicker in the middle 
than at the ends, roll them well until no small bits are perceptible 
amongst them. We have found this method answer admirably ; but 
as some of the oil is exnressed from the almonds by it, and absorbed 
by the board, we woula recommend a marble slab for them in pre- 
ference, when it is at hand ; and should they be intended for a sweet 
dish, that some pounded sugar should be strewed under them. Wben 
a board or strong trencher is used, it should be rather higher in the 
middle than at £e sides. 

TO COLOUR ALMOIOMS OB SITGAB-ORAINSy OB SUOAB-CAlTDTy FOB 
QAXSBy OB PA8TBT. 

Blanch, dry, and chop them rather coarsely ; pour a little prqnred 
cochineal into the hands, and roll the almonds between them until 
they are equally coloured ; then spread them on a sheet of paper, and 
place them in a very gentle degree of heat to dry. Use spinage- 
juice (see page 455), to colour them ereen, and a strong infusion of 
saffiron to give them a yellow tint 'Shtj have a pretty effect when 
strewed over the icing of tarts or cakes, espedally the rose-oolouied 
ones, which should be rather nale. The sugar is prefnred in the 
same way, after being first broken into lumps, and then, wiUi the end 
of a paste-roller, into grains about the size of a pea ; but unless it be 
dry and hard, and carefully done, it will absorb too much of the 
cochineal : when but slightly coloured it is very ornamental dropped 



CHAP. XXYI.] CAKES. 54S 

cm the borders of creamed iowies^ or on other varieties of fine pastiy. 
White sugar-candy broken into large grains or erystalfl and colonred 
in the same manner has a yet better effect 

TO FREPARB BUTTEB FOB RICH CAKES. 

For all large and very rich cakes the nsoal directions are, to heat 
the butter to a cream ; but we find that they are quite as light when 
it is cut small and gently melted with just so much heat as will dis- 
solre it, and no more. If it be shaken round in a saucepan preyiously 
warmed, and held near the fire for a short time, it will soon lie 
liquefied, which is all that is required : it must on no account be hot 
when it is added to the other ingredients, to which it must be poured 
In small portions after they are all mixed, in the way which we have 
minutely described in the receipt for a Madeira cake, and that of the 
Sutherland puddings (Chapter XXI.) To cream it, drain the 
water well from it after it is cut, soften it a little before the fire 
should it be very hard, and then with the back of a large strou 
wooden spoon beat it until it resembles thick cream. When prepare 
thus, the sugar is added to it first, and then the other ingredients in 
•uccession. For plum-cakes it is better creamed than liquefied, as 
the fruit requires a paste of some consistence to prerent its sinkinff to 
the bottom of the mould in which it is baked. For plain seed-ctULes 
the more simple plan answers perfectly. 

TO WHISK EQOS FOR LIGHT RICH CAKB8. 

Break them one by one, and separate the yolks from the whites: 
this is done easily by pourinff the yolk from one half of the shell to 
the other, and letting the white drop fix)m it into a basin beneath. 
With a small three-pronged fork take out the specks from each tag 
as it is broken, that none may accidentally escape notice. Whisk the 
yolks until the^r appear light, and the whites until thev are a quite 
solid frt>th ; wmle any liquid remains at the bottom of the bowl thev 
are not sufiidently b^ten : when a portion of them, taken up with 
the whisk, and oropped from it, remains standing in points, they 
are in the proper state for use, and should be mixed with the cake 
directly. 

SUOAR-GLAZmGS AND ICINGS. 

{For Fine Pastry and Cakes.) 

The dear elaze which resembles barley sugar, and which requires 
to be as carefully guarded fix)m damp, is given by just dipping the 
surface of the pastry into liquid caramel ^see Chapter AXYlL) ; or by 
sifting sugar thickly oyer it directiy it is drawn frt>m the oven, and 
melting it down with a salamander, or red-hot shovel held closely 



544 XODEBN COOKEBT. [caAP. xzn. 

over it ; or by setting it again into an oven suffidentlj heated to dis- 
solve the sugar : though this latter method is not so well, as then is 
danger from it of the paste being scorched. To make a fine white or 
coloured icing, whisk, as directed above, the whites of four fresh em 
to a perfectly solid froth, then, with a wooden spoon or spatula, mix 
gradually with them one pound of the best sugar, whidi has been 
dried, and sifted throu^ a fine sieve: work t£em together for a 
minute or two, and add less than a dessertspoonful of strained lemon- 
juice ; spread it even over the cake or pastry, and dry it very gen^ 
indeed^ either in a quite cool oven, or in a meat screen placed before 
the fire. From the difference in the size of eggs, a little more or les 
of sugar may be required for this icing. It may be coloured with a 
very few drops of prepared cochineal to give it a rose tint. 

Whites of effgs beaten to snow, 4 ; sugar, 1 lb. ; lemon-juioe, small 
dessertspoonfiu. 

OltANQE-FLOWER MACAROONS. (DELICIOUS.) 

Have ready two pounds of very dry white sifted sugar. Wei^ 
two ounces of the petals of freshly gathered orange-blosBoms after 
they have been picked from the stems ; and cut them veiy snttU 
with a pair of scissors into the sugar, as they will become discoloured 
if not mixed with it quickly after they are cut. When all are done, 
add the whites of seven eggs, and whisk the whole well together xmtQ 
it looks like snow ; then drop the mixture on paper without delay, 
and send the cakes to a veiy cool oven. 

Pounded sugar, 2 lbs. ; orange-blossoms, 2 oz. ; whites of eggs, 7 . 
20 minutes or more. 

Obs.— It is almost impossible to state with accuracy the precise time 
required for these cakes, so much depends on the oven : they diould 
be very delicately coloured, and yet dried through. 



ALMOND MACAROONS. 

Blanch a pound of fresh Jordan almonds, wipe them dry, and set 
them into a very cool oven to render them perfectly so ; pound ^^tum 
to an exceedingly smooth paste, with a little white of ^g, then whiak 
to a firm solid fifoth the wnite of seven esgs, or of eight, should tb^ 
be small ; mix with them a pound and a haLPof the nnest sugar; add 
these by degrees to the almonds, whisk the whole up well together, 
and drop the mixture upon wafer-paper, which may be procured at 
the confectioner's : bake the cakes in a moderate oven a very pak 
brown. It is an improvement to their flavour to substitute an ounce 
of bitter almonds for one of the sweet They are sometimes made 
with an equal weight of each ; and aiv^ther variety of them is ob- 
tained by gently browning the almonds in a slow oven before they 
are pounded. 



q^AP. XXTI.J CAKES. 545 

Joidan almonds blanched, 1 lb. ; BOgar, 1| lb. : whites of 7 or 8 
eggs . 15 to 20 minutes. 

TEBY FINE COCOA-NUT MACABOONS. 

Rasp a fresh cocoa-nnt, spread it on a dish or tin, and let it dry 
gradually for a couple of days, if it can be done convenienUy ; add 
to it double its weight of fine sifted sugar, and the whites of eight 
ef^ beaten to a scud froth (see nage 543), to the pound. Roll the 
znutnre into small balls, place them on a buttered tin, and bake 
them in a yery gentle oven about twenty minutes. Move them from 
the tin while they are warm, and store them in a very dry canister as 
soon as they are cold. 

Cocoa-nut, | lb. ; sugar, 1 lb. : whites of eggs, 8 : yery gentle 
oven, 20 minutes. 

IMPERIALS, (not VERT RICH.) 

Work into a pound of flour six ounces of butter, and mix well 
with them half a pound of silted sugar, six ounces of currants, two 
ounces of candied orange-peel, the crated rind of a lemon, and four 
well-beaten eggs. Flour a tin lightly, and with a couple of forks 
place the paste upon it in small rough heaps quite, two mokes apart. 
&dice them in a very ffentle oven, from a quarter of an hour to 
twenty minutes, or until they are equally coloured to a pale brown. 

Flour 1 lb. ; butter, 6 oz. ; sugar, 8 oz. ; currants, 6 oz. ; candied 
peel, 2 oz. ; rind of 1 lemon ; eggs, 4 : 15 to 20 minutes. 

FINB ALMOND CAKE. 

Blanch, dry, and pound to the finest possible paste, eight ounces of 
finesh Jordan almonds, and one ounce of. bitter ; moisten them with 
a few drops of cold water or white of egg, to nrevent their oiling; 
then mix with them very gradually twme ^rem eggs which have 
been whisked until they are exceedingly light ; throw i^ by degrees 
one pound of fine, dry, sifted sugar, and keep the mixture light by 
constant beating, with a large wooden spoon, as the separate in- 
gredients are added. Wx in by de^^iees three-quarters of a pound 
of dried and sifted flour of the best OLality; then pour gently from 
the sediment a pound of butter which has been just melted, but not 
allowed to become hot, and beat it yeiy gradually, but yeiy 
thoroughly, into the cake, letting one portion entirely disappear 
before another is thrown in ; add the rasped or finely-grated rinds of 
two sound fresh lemons, fill a thickly-buttered mould rather more 
than half fuU with the mixture, and bake the cake from an hour 
and a half to 'wo hours in a well-heated oven. Lay paper over the 
top when it is sufficiently coloured, and guard carefully against its 
being burned.

Jordan all[iond0» i lb. ; bitter almonds, 1 oz. ; ^ggs, 12 ; aufcar, 1 
lb. ; flour, | lb. ; butter, 1 lb. ; rinds lemons, 2 : 1| to 2 hours. 

Obs. — Three-quarters of a pound of almonds may be mixed wxdi 
this cake when so large a portion of them is liked, but an additional 
ounce or two of sugar, and one egg or more, will then be required. 

PLAIN POUND OB CURRANT CAKE. 

(Or rich Brawn Bracky or Borrow Brack,) 

Mix, as directed in the foregoing receipt, ten ^ggs (some oooka 
take a pound in weight of these^ one pound of sugar, one of flour, 
and as much of butter. For a plum-cake, let the butter be worked 
to a cream ; add the sugar to it first, then the yolks of the ^gs, 
next stir lightly in the whites, after which, add one pound of cur- 
rants and the candied peel, and, last of all, tiie flour by d^^rees, and 
a elass of brandy when it is liked. Nearly or quite two hours* 
Daking will be required for this, and one hour for half the quantity. 

To convert the above into the popular Irish " speckled bread,** or 
Brawn Brack of the richer kind, add to it three ounces of carraway- 
seeds : these are sometimes used in combination with the currantSy 
but more commonly without. To ice a cake see the receipt for 
Sugar Glazings at the commencement of this Chapter, page 543. A 
rose-tint may be given to the icing with a little prepired cochinealy 
as we have nid there. 

RICE CAKE. 

Take six eggs, with their weight in fine sugar, and in butter also, 
and hdf their weight of flour of rice, and half of wheaten flour ; 
make the cake as directed for the Madeira or almond cake, but 
throw in the rice after the flour ; then add the butter in the usual 
way, and bake the cake about an hour and ten minutes. Give any 
flavour that is liked. The butter may be altogether omitted. Thu 
is a moderate-sized cake. 

Effgs, in the shell, 6 ; their weight in butter and in sugar ; half aa 
mucn flour of rice, and the same of wheaten flour : 1 hour, 10

weight of dried and sifted sugar, the yolks and whites of eight eggs, 
separately whisked, two ounces of candied orange-peel, hdf a tea- 
spoonful of mace, a glass of brandy, one pound of flour strewed in by 
de^ees, and last of all a pound and a quarter of currants. Directly 
it IS mixed send the cake to a well-heated oven, and bake it for two 
hours. Four ounces of pounded almonds are sometimes added to it

A GOOD SPONGB CAKE. 

Basp on some lumps of well-refined sugar the rind of a fine sound 
lemon, and scrape off the part which has imbibed ike essence, or 
crush the lumps to powder, and add them to as much more as wUl 
make up the weight of eight or ten fresh eggs in the shell ; break 
these one by one, and separate the whites from the yolks ; beat the 
latter in a larse bowl for ten minutes, then strew in the sugar 
gradually, and beat them well together. In the mean time let the 
irhites be whisked to a quite solid nroth, add them to the yolks, and 
when they they are well blended oft and stir the flour ffently to 
to them, but do not beat it into the mixture ; pour the cake into a 
well-buttered mould, and bake it an hour ana a quarter in a mo- 
derate oven. 

Basped rind. 1 large lemon ; fresh c^gs, 8 or 10 ; their weight of 
dry, silted sugary and half their weight of flour: baked, li nour, 
moderate oyen. 

A SMALLER SPONOB CAKE. 

(Very good.) 

Fire full-sized esgs, the weight of four in sugar, and of nearly 
three in flour, wiU make an exceedingly good caJke: it majr be 
flavoured, like the preceding one, with lemon-rind, or with bitter 
almonds, vanilla, or oonfected orange-blossoms reduced to powder. 
An hour will bake it thoroughly. All the ingredients for sponge 
cakes should be of good quality, and the sugar and flour snomd 
be diy ; they should also be passed through a fine sieve kept ex- 
pressly for such purposes. The excellence of the whole depends 
much on the manner m which the eggs are whisked : this should be 
done as lightlv asr possible, but it is a mistake to suppose that they 
cannot be too lonff beaten, as after they are brought to a state of 
perfect firmness they are injured by a continuation of the whisUng, 
and will at times curdle, and render a cake heavy from this cause.' 

FINE YENETIAN CAKE OR CAKES. 

Take of sound Jordan almonds, blanched and well dried at the 
mouth of a cool oven or in a sunny window, seven ounces, full 
weieht, and one of bitter almonds with them ; pound the whole to a 
perfect paste with a few drops of white of egg or orai^-flower 
water ; then mix them thoroughly with one pound of flour and 
eight ounces of butter rwhioh snould be cool and firm, or it will 
render the pa^te too soft), and break this down quite small • then 



548 MODERN COOKEBT. [chap. zxn. 

add eight ounces of pounded sugar, on part of which the rind of a 
fine lemon has been rasped previously to its being crushed to powder. 
Make these into a paste witii the yolks of four ^gs, or with rather 
less should th^ be large, for if too moist, it will adhere to the board 
and roller. To make a Venetian cake of moderate size, roll the 
paste less than a quarter of an inch thick, and cut with the laz^ 
fluted cutter, shown at page 376, six or seven portions of equal size; 
lay them on lightly floured or buttered tins, and bake them in a 
slow oven until thev are firm and crisp, and equally coloured of a 
pale brown. Should they seem to require it, lay Uiem one on the 
other, while they are still warm, and place a baking-tin, with a slight 
weight upon them to render them quite level. When they are 
cold, spread upon each a different kind of choice preserve, and pQe 
the whole evenly into the form of an entire cake. The top may be 
iced, and decorated with pistachio-nuts, or grains of coloured sugar, 
or with a wreath of almond-naste leaves. There are many varieties 
of this dish, which is known oy different names in different countries. 
It is sometimes called a Neapolitan Cake, sometimes a Thousand 
Leaf Cake d la FrangaUe, It is occasionally made entirely of almond- 
paste, and highly decorated ; it maj be formed also of many layers 
of puff or fine short crust cut of uniform size, or graduall^r less, so as 
to leave round each a clear border of an inch wide, wmch may be 
covered with coloured icin^, or ornamented with preserved mut, 
tinted almonds, grains of wmte or pink sugar candy, or aught else 
that the fantnr may direct 

To make the small Venetian cakes, roll the paste directed for the 
large one at the commencement of this receipt, into balls, flatten 
them with the hand to about the third of an inch thick, bnuh them 
with beaten egff, and cover them plentifully with white sugar-candy 
crushed about half the size of a pea : bake them in a slow oven. 

Almonds, 8 oz. ; flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 8 oz. ; sugar, ^ lb. ; rind of 
1 lemon; yolks of eggs, 3 to 4 ; preserve as needed. 



▲ GOOD MADBIRA CAKE. 

Whisk four fresh eggs until they are as light as posrible, then» 
eontinuinff still to whisk them, throw in by 9low degrees the follow- 
ing ingredients in the order in which thev are written : six ounces of 
dry, pounded, and sifted sugar ; six of flour, also dried and sifted ; 
four ounces of butter just dissolved, but not heated ; the rind of a 
fresh lemon ; and the instant before the cake is moulded, beat well in 
the third of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda: bake it an hour in a 
moderate oven. Ir this, as in all compositions of the same natore, 
observe particularly that each portion of butter must be beaten into 
the mixture until no appearance of it remains before the next is 
added ; and if this be done, and the preparation be kept light by con- 
stant and h'ght whiddng, the cake will be as good, if not better, than 



CHAP. ZXYX. CAKES. 549 

if the butter were creamed. Candied citron can be added to the 
paste, but it is not needed. 

^ggs, 4 ; sugar, 6 oz. ; flour, 6 oz. ; batter, 4 oz. ; rind of 1 lemon ; 
carbonate of soda, i of teaspoonful : 1 hour, moderate oven. 

A SOLIMEMNE. 

A rich French hreakfast eake, or Sally Zunn, 

From three-quarters of a pound of flour take three ounces for the 
leaven, and make it into a lithe paste with half an ounce of solid, well- 
-washed yeast (see Chapter XXXI.), mixed with two or three 
tablespoonsful of iust warm cream, or new milk ; throw a doth over 
and leave it near tne fire to rise for about half an hour, or until it is 
twice its original size. In the interim make a hollow in the centre of 
the remainder of the flour, and put into it a quarter of an ounce of 
fine salt, one ounce of pounded sugar, the yolks of four fresh e^gs, 
four ounces of lukewarm butter, and a couple of tablespoonsful of 
cream, also warm. Mix the whole gently and carefully mto a per- 
fectly smooth paste, flatten it with the hand upon the dresser, spread 
the leaven over it, and blend them thoroughly with light kneading, 
as directed for brtoche paste, page 349. The whole should be of the 
same colour throughout. 

Next, put it into a small, well-buttered copper stewpan, 'or plain 
cake-mould, and let it remain in a moderately warm place until it 
has risen, like the leaven, to double its original size ; then with a 
paste-brush or feather wash the top with beaten egff, and without 
disturbing it, set it into a tolerably quick oven, and hake it nearly or 
^mite an hour ; but do not allow it to be too deeply coloured. Turn 
it from the mould, cut it once or twice asunder, and pour over the 
slices plenty of good butter, just dissolved in a small saucepan ; put 
the cake together again, and serve it immediately. It may be con- 
verted into an exceUent entremets by spreading currant, or other fine 
jelly, or preserve, quickly upon it when it is cut, and sifting sugar 
thickly on the top after it is restored to its proper form : it is then 
called a Dresden cake. We think that when left until cold and 
toasted, the solimemne is even better than when served hot It will 
be many hours rising ; sometimes as many as six or eight. If wanted 
for breakfast it should be made over night.

BANBURT CAKES. 

First, mix well together a pound of currants, cleaned with great 
nicety and dried, a quarter-pound of beef suet, finely minced, three 
ounces each of candied orange and lemon-rind, shred smidl, a few 
grains of salt, a full quarter-ounce of pounded cixmamon and nutmeg 



560 MODEBK COOKEBT. [chap. xxn. 

mixed, and four ounces of macaroons or ratafias rolled to powder. 
Next, make a light paste with fourteen ounces of butter to the pound 
of flour ; give it an extra turn or two to prevent its rising too much 
in the oven ; roll out one half in a very thin square, and spread the 
mixed fruit and spice equally upon it ; moisten the edges, lay on the 
remaining half of the paste, rolled equally thin, press the edses 
securely tojo^ether, mark the whole with the back of a Knife in r^;cuar 
divisions of two inches wide and three in length, bake the pastry in a 
well-heated oven from twenty-five to thirty minutes, and divide it 
into cakes while it is still warm. They may be served as a second 
course dish either hot or cold, and may be glazed at pleasure. 

Currants, 1 lb. ; beef-suet, 4 oz. ; candied orange and lemon-iind 
each, 3 oz. ; salt, small pinch; mixed spices, i oz.; macaroons or 
ratafias, 4 oz. : baked 25 to 30 minutes. 

MERXNGUES. 

Whisk, to the firmest possible 
froth, the whites of six very 
firesh eggs, taking every pre- 
caution against a particle or the 
yolk fallmg in amongst them. 
Lay some squares or long strips 
of writing-paper closely upon a 
board or upon very clean tren- 
chers, which ought to be nearly 
or quite an inch thick, to pre- 
vent the meringues from re- 
ceiving any colour from the , 
bottom of the oven. When all 
is ready, mix vrith the eggs three-quarters of a pound of the finest 
sugar, well dried, and smed ; stir them together for half a minute, 
then with a table or dessertspoon lay the mixture quickly on the 
papers in the form of a half-egg, sift sugar over them without delay, 
blow off with the bellows all that does not adhere, and set the me- 
ringues into a gentle oven. The process must be expeditious, or the 
sugar melting will cause the cakes to spread, instead of retaininc; the 
shape of the spoon, as they ought. Tne whole art of making &an, 
indeed, appears to us to consist in preserving their proper form, and 
the larser the proportion of sugar worked into the ^gs, the more 
easily this will be aone. When they are coloured to alight brown, 
and are firm to the touch, draw them out^ turn the papers gently 
over, separating the meringues from them, and with a teaspoon scoop 
out suflicient of the insides to form a space for some whipped cream 
or preserve, and put them again into the oven upon clean sheets of 
paper, with the moist sides uppermost, to dry : when tiiey are crisp 
through they are done. Let them become cold; fill, and then j<Hii

peannce shown in the plate. Spikes of pistachio nuts, or almonds, 
can be stuck over them, an represented there, at pleasure. They 
afford always, if well made, a second course dish of elegant appear- 
ance, and they are equally ornamental to breakfasts or suppers of 
ceremony. They are made in perfection by the pastry-cooks in 
France, being equally light, delicate, and delicious. Much of their 
excellence, it must be observed, depends at all times on the attention 
they receive in the baking, as well as in the previous preparation. 
They must, of course, be quite cold before the preserve or cream is 
laid into them. From four to six ounces of almonds, finely pow- 
dered, may be smoothly mixed with the other ingredients for them ; 
and ihey may be flavoured with citron, lemon, or orange-rind by 
raspinff the skins of the fruit with part of the sugar with which they 
are to be made ; then drying, and reducing it to powder. 

Whites of very fresh ^gs, 6 ; sugar, f lb. : gentle oven, 20 to 30 
minutes. 

ITALIAK MERINGUES. 

Take for these the proportion of whites of eggs and sugar already 
indicated in the receipt for Nesselr6de pudding, page 491, that is to 
say, six to the pound, or half that quantity for a small number of 
meringues. Boil the sugar with a -put of water until it whitens, and 
begins to fall in flakes from the slummer ; have the eggs whisked to 
a perfectly solid froth quite ready at the proper moment, and when 
the sugar has stood for two or three minutes, and been worked well 
from the sides of the pan, mingle them gradually, but very quickly, 
with it, that the mass may be quite smooth ; continue to stir them 
until they become firm enough to retain their shape perfectly when 
moulded vdth a teaspoon ; lay out the cakes on paper, and place them 
in an oven so slow as to harden without giving them colour. As 
they are not to be filled, but merely fastened together, they may 
be baked on tins. Fart of them may be varied by the addition of 
three or four ounces of pounded almonds mixed thoroughly with the 
remainder of the eggs and sugar, when a portion of Uie meringues 
have been moulded : these, however, will require to be much longer 
baked than the others ; but they will be excellent. They should be 
lightly browned, and crisp quite through. 

Sugar, 1 lb. ; water, 1 pint ; whites of eggs, 6 : very slow oven, 20 
to 30 minutes, or longer. 

THICK, LIGHT GINGEBBREAB*

thus will be remarkably li^ht and good. For children part of the

05#.— We think that something less than the half ounce of soda 
would be sufficient for this giugerbread, for with the whole quantity 
it rises in the oren to three times its heiffht, and is apt to run over 
the tops of the tins, even when they are but half filled with it at first; 
or if it were well beaten into the mass without an^ water, after being 
carefully freed from lumps and mixed with a httle sugar, the cake 
would still be quite light. 

ACTON OINOERBRBAD. 

Whisk four strained or well-cleared eggs to the lightest poadbla 
fh>th (French eggs, if really sweet, will answer for the purpose), and 
pour to them, by degrees, a pound and a quarter of treade, still 
beating them lightly. Add, in the same manner, mx ounces of palt 
brown sugar me from lumps, one pound of sifted flour, and six 
ounces of good butter, jW sufficiently wanned to be liquid, and no 
more, for ii hot, it would render the cake heavy ; it should be poursd 
in sniall portions to the mixture, which should be well beaten up with 
the back of a wooden spoon as each portion is thrown in : the suoceai 
of the cake depends almost entirely on this part of the prooesL 
When properly mingled with the mass, the butter will not be per- 
ceptible on the surface; and if the cake be kept light by constant 
whisking, large bubbles will appear in it to the last. When it is so 
far ready, add to it one ounce of Jamaica ginger and a lar^ tea- 
spoonful of cloves in fi ne powder, with the lightly grated rmds of 
two fresh full-sized lemons. Butter thickly, in every part, a shallow 
square tin pan, and bake the gingerbread slowly for nearly or quite 
an hour in a gentle oven. Let it cool a little before it ia turned out, 
\ and set it on its edge until cold, supporting it, if needful, against a 
V large jar or bowL We have usually had it baked in an American 
oven, in a tin less than two inches deep ; and it has been excellent.

and fine, six onnces of flour, three of butter, a grain or two of salt, some 
grated lemon-rind or candied peel sliced yeiy thin, and half an ounce 
or more of ginger in fine powder. Prepare and mix these ingredients 
in the order in which they are written, by the directions for ^ Acton 
Gingerbread.** Bake the cake nearly the same time. An American 
oiyen will answer for it perfectly, and it will resemble a really rich 
cake, though so cheap. A STnaU quantity of carbonate of soda may 
be added quite at last by inexpert cake-makers, to insure its being 
light. The same mixture may be baked in small cups or tins in an 
iron oven. For a cake of tolerable size half as much again of the 
ingredients must be taken, and the whole poured into a round or 
square cake-mould. 

GOOD COMMON GINGERBREAD. 

Work very smoothly six ounces of fresh butter (or some that has 
been well ifmhed from the salt, and wrunf dry in a cloth) into one 
pound of flour, and mix with them thoroughly an ounce of ginger in 
fine powder, four ounces of brown sugar, and half a teaspoonlul of 
beaten cloves and mace. Wet these with three-quarters of a pound 
of cold treacle, or rather more, if needful ; roll out the paste, cut the 
cakes with a round tin cutter, lay them on a floured or buttered 
baking tin, and put them into a very slow oven. Lemon-grate or 
candied peel can be added, when it is liked.

half a pound of sugar and three-quarters of an ounce of fi;inger. 
When the paste is quite cold, roll it out with as much more flour as 
will prevent its adhering to the board: bake the cakes in a very 
gentle oven.

▲ DELICIOUS CREAM-CAKE Aim SWEET RUSES. 

When in rery sultry weather cream becomes acid from being sent 
to a distance, or from other causes, it may still be made available for 
delicate pastry-crust, and sui>erlatiye cakes, biscuits, and bread ; but 
if eyer so slightly ^pwAru/ it will be fit only to be thix>wn away. The 
following receipt is giyen exactly as it was used with perfect success 
on the thought of the moment, when we first had it tried. Crumble 
down fiye oimces of good butter into a pound of fine flour, then mix 
thoroughly with them half a pound of sifted sugar, a few grains of 
salt, and two ounces of candied citron or orange-rind sliced tmn ; add 
somethii^ more than half a pint of thick and rather sour cream 
mixed with two well whisked e^gs, and just before the paste is put 
into the moulds, which should be buttered in eyery part and only 
two-thirds filled, beat thoroughly into it half a teaspoonful of the 
yery best carbonate of soda, which has been perfectly blended with 
twice the quantity of sugar and of flour, and rubbed through a fine 
sieye, or worked to the smoothest powder in a mortar, or in any 
other way. 

For the conyenience of haying it baked in a small iron oyen, this 
quantity was divided into two cakes, one of which was gently pulled 
apart with a couple of forks while still hot, and then set again into 
the oven and crisped with a gentle heat quite through : it was thus 
converted into the very nicest sweet rusks. Sufficient cream should 
be used for the cakes to convert the ingredients into a very lithe 
paste or thick batter, which can be properljr worked or mixed with a 
wooden spoon, with^ the back of wmch it should be very lightly 
Ix^tcn up before it is moulded. About three-quarters of annour 
will bake it in a moderate oven. It should be firm on the surface— 
as all li^ht cakes should be — ^that it may not sink and become heavy 
after it is drawn out. Turn it from the mould, and lay it on its siSs 
upon a sieve reversed, to cooL

pinch of salt and four ounces of pounded snsar ; hollow the centre, 
and stir into it a large tablespoonful of solicT wedl-washed yeast (or 
an ounce of German yeast which will ferment more quickly), diluted 
with three-ouarters of a pint of warm new milk ; when sufficient of 
the surroundinff flour is mixed with it to form a thick batter strew 
more flour on uie top, lay a cloth once or twice folded together over 
the ^an, and let it remain until the leaven has become very light : 
this it will generally be in an hour and a quarter, or, at the utmost, 
in an hour and a half. The fermentation may be quickened by in* 
creasing the proportion of yeast, but this is l)etter avoided, as it may 
chance to render the cake bitter; additional time, however, must 
always be allowed for it to rise when but a small quantitv is used. 
When the leaven is at the proper height, add to a couple of well 
whisked eggs, sufficient nearly-boiling milk to warm them, and mix 
them with the other ingredients ; then beat well into the cake by 
degrees, eieht ounces more of pounded susar, and half a grated nut- 
m^ ; cut irom two to three ounces of candied citron thin, and strew 
over it ; leave it again to rise, as before, for about three-<|uarters of 
an hour ; iqix the dtron equally with it, put it into a thickly but- 
tered tin or earthen pan, and bake it in a quick oven for an hour and 
ten minutes at the least, and after it is placed in it let it not be moved 
imtil it is quite set, or it will possibly be heavy at the top. The 

E rated rinds of a couple of lemons will improve its flavour. Fine 
isbon sugar can be used to sweeten it instead of pounded, but the 
' difference of expense would be very slight, and the cake would not be 
dO good; the quantitycan, of course, be diminished when it is con* 
sidered too much. Three-quarters of a pound of currants can, at 
choice, be substituted for the citron. Three ounces of carraway 
seeds will convert it into common broum bracks or Irish seed-cake. 
For the manner of purifying yeast, see Chapter XXXI. 



A VERT CHEAP LUNCHEON BISCUIT^ OR NURSERY CAKE. 

Two or three pounds of white bread dough taken when ready for 
the oven, will make a good light biscuit if well managed, with the 
addition of from half to three-quarters of a pound of sugar, a very 
small quantity of butter, and a few currants, or carraway-seeds, or a 
teaspoonful of mixed spices. The dough should be rather firm ; the 
butter should first be well kneaded into it in small portions, then the 
sugar added in the same way, and next the currants or spice. The 
whole should be perfectly and equally mingled, flour being sliffhtly 
dredged upon it as it is worked, ii needful. It must then l^ alj&wed 
to rise until it is very light, when it should again be kneaded dowut 
but not heavily ; and when it has once more risen, it should be sent 
without delay to the oven. An ounce of butter to the pound of 
dough will be sufficient for it. Much richer cakes can be made thus» 
ani they will be extremely good if care be taken to let them ris*

ISLE OF WIOHT DOUaH-NITTS. 

Work smoothly tojjXtheT with the fingers four ounces of good lard, 
and four pounds of £)ur ; add half a pound of fine brown sugar, two 
tablespoonsful of allspice, one drachm of pounded cinnamon, half as 
much of cloves, two large blades of mace, beaten to powder, two 
tablespoonsful of fresh yeast which has been watered for one night, 
and wnich should be solid, and as much new milk as will make the 
whole into a rather firm dough ; let this stand from an hour to an 
hour and a half near the fire, then knead it well, and make it into 
balls about the size of a small apple ; hollow them with the thumb, and 
enclose a few currants in the middle ; gather the paste well over 
them, and throw the dough-nuts into a saucepan half filled with 
boiling lard ; when thev are eaually coloured to a fine brown, lift 
them out and dry them before tne fire on the back of a sieve. When 
they are made in lar^ ouantities, as they are at certain seasons in the 
island, they are drained upon very dean straw. The lard should 
boil onlv just before they are dropped into it, or the outsides will be 
scorched before the insides are sufficiently done. 

Flour, 4 lbs. ; lard, 4 oz. ; sugar, ^ lb. ; allspice, 2 tablespoonsful ; 
pounded cinnamon, 1 drachm ; cloves and mace, each i drachm ; 
yeast (solid), two larffe tablespoonsful: to rise, 1 to l|hour. Cur- 
rants, at choice : dough-nuts boiled in lard, 5 to 7 minutes. 

QtEEN CAKES. 

To make these, proceed exactly as for the pound currant-cake of 
page 546, but bske the mixture in small well-buttered tin pans 
(heart-shaped ones are usual), in a somewhat brisk oven, for aoout 
twenty minutes. 

JUMBLES. 

Rasp on some good sugar the rinds of two lemons ; dry, reduce it 
to powder, and sift it with as much more as will make up a pound in 
weight ; mix with it one pound of flour, four well-beaten ^gs, and 
six ounces of warm butter : drop the mixture on buttered tms, and 
bake the jumbles in a very slow oven fh)m twenty to thirty minutes. 
They should be pale, but perfectly crisp.

half a pound of sifted sugar, and pour to them first, a quarter of a 
pint of boiling milk, and next, three well- whisked eggs; add some 
nated nutmeg, or fresh lemon-rind, and eight ounces of currants, 
deaued and cuied ; beat the whole well ana lightly together, then 
strew in a very sniall teaspoonful of good carbonate of soda in the 
fiLnest powder, which has been rubbed tnrough a sieve and well mixed 
with a little su^, and again beat the cake well and liffhtly for 
three or four mmutes; put it into a buttered mould, and bake it 
from an hour to an hour and a quarter ; or divide it in two, when 
three-quarters of an hour will be sufficient for each part.

eggs, 3 ; currants, i lb. ; good carbonate of soda, 1 very smidl tea- 
spoonful : 1 to 1} hour. Or : divided in two, 1 to f hour. 

06#.— This, if eareflilly made, resembles a pound cake, but i» 
much less expensive, and fiu* more wholesome, while it has the 
advantage of being very expeditiously prepared. Great care, how- 
ever, must be taken to avoid mixioff with it too large a proportion, 
or a coarse quality of soda; as either will impart to it a far from 
agreeable flavour. 

GOOD SCOTTISH SHORTBREAD* 

With one pound of flour mix well two ounces of sifted sugar, and 
one of candied orange-rind or citron, sliced small ; make these into 
a paste with from ei^ht to nine ounces of good butter, made suf- 
ficiently warm to be hquid ; press the paste together vrith the hands, 
and mould it upon tins into large cakes nearly an inch thick, pinch 
the edges, and oake the shortbread in a moderate oven for twenty 
minut^ or longer, should it not be quite crisp, but do not aJlow it to 
become deeply coloured. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; sugar, 2 oz. ; candied orange or citron, 1 oz. ; butter, 
8 to 9 oz. : 20 minutes or more. 

Obs. — This, to many persons, is a very indigestible compound, 
though agreeable to the taste. 

A GALETTE. 

The galette is a favourite cake in France, and may be made rich 
and comparatively delicate, or c[uite common, by using more or less 
butter for it, and by augmenting or diminishing the size. Work 
lightly three-quarters of a pound of good butter into a pound of 
flour, add a large saltRpoonful of salt, and make these into a paste 
with the yolks of a couple of eggs mixed with a small cupful of good 
cream, or simply with water ; roll this into a complete round, three- 
quarters of an inch thick ; score it in small diamonds, brush yolk of 
egg over the top, and bake the galette for about half an hour in a

SMALL SVQAR CAKES OF YABIOUS KINDS. 

To make very sweet rich sugar cakes mingle, first working it veiy 
small with the fingers, half a jjound of butter with each pound of 
flour : if more than this proportion be used the paste will be too soft 
to permit the addition or the proper number or eggs. Next, blend 
thoroughly with these three-quarters of a pound of dry afled sugar, 
and the grated rinds of two small fresh lemons (for lemon-cakes the 
strained juice of one is generally added), or a dessertspoonful of 
cinnamon freshly pounded ; or from one ounce to two ounces of car- 
raway- seeds ; or a similar proportion of the finest powdered ginger; 
or three-quarters of a pound of very dry well cleaned curranta. A 
slight pinch of salt should be thrown in with the sugar. If to be 
made mto flat ciJces proceed to moisten these ingredients gradually 
with from two eggs to four slightly whisked, and when they form a 
/irm paste, proc^ quickly to roll and to stamp them out with a cake 
tin ; for as the sugar dissolves with the moisture of the ^gs, the 
paste will otherwise become so lithe as to adhere to the boara and 
roller. When it is to be merely dropped on the baking-sheets, it 
will require an additional egg or more. The cakes should then be 
placed quite two inches apart, as they will spread in the baking. 

Five ounces of butter with six of sugxc to the pound of flour, two 
large eggs, and a snuJl quantity of miUc, will be sufficient for quite 
cheap sugar cakes : any flavour can be given to them as to tnose 
whicn precede, and they can be rendered more or less sweet to the 
taste by altering the proportion of sugar : this should always be 
sifted, or at least reduced quite to powder, before it is used for them. 
One ounce more of butter will render them very good. They should 
be rolled a quarter of an inch thick. 

Rich : to each lb. of flour, butter, | lb. ; sugar, f lb. ; eggs, 2 to 4. 
(Lemon-rinds, cinnamon, carraway-seeds, or ginger, or currants at

LIGHT BUNS OF DIFFERENT KINDS. 

QitUe plain hmu toitkotit hstter.'-YeTy good light buns may be made 
entirely without butter, but they must be tolerably fresh when 
served. To make them, dilute very smoothly an ounce of sweet 
Crerman yeast or a large tablespoonful of quite solid and well 
washed English yeast with a pint of warm new milk ; mix this 
immediately with as much flour as it will convert into a rather thick 
batter, throw a double cloth over the pan, and place it where the 
warmth of the fire will search, without heating it. When it is well 
risen and bubbles appear on the top, add a little salt, some pounded 
sugar, and as much nour as will form it into a lieht dou^h. jLeave it 
to rise again, when it will probably be too littk firm for moulding 
with the fingers, and must be beaten up with a strong wooden spoon 
and put into cups or tin pans slightly buttered, to be baked. The 
buns should be sent to a quick oven, and baked until the entire 
florfaoe is well browned. These directions may appear to the reader 
somewhat vague ; but we must franklv state that we have no precise 
memorandum by us of this receipt, though we have had buns made 
by it very successfUly in former years : we cannot, however, 
exactly recall the proportion of flour which was used for them, but 
believe it was about two pounds. For this quantity half a pound of 
sugar would be sufficient The batter will oe a long time rising to 
the proper height; an hour and a half or two hours. Currants, 
carraways, nutmeg, or mixed spices, can always be added at dis- 
cretion. 

It is usual to strew a few currants on the tops of the buns before 
they are baked. 

To render them richer and firmer, it is merely necessary to di- 
minish the pronortion of milk, and to crumble up very smaU two or 
more ounces of butter in the flour which is added to tne batter after 
it has risen. When again quite light, the dough may then be rolled 
into balls, and placed on flat tins some inches apart until they have 
sporead to the projper shape. Confectioners generally wash the tops 
with milk, and sift a little sugar over them. 

Exeter Btau, — These are somewhat celebrated in the dt^ whose 
name they bear, espedallv those of one maker whose secret for them 
we have recently obtained. Instead of being made into a dou^h with 
milk, Devonshire cream is used for them, either entirely or m part. 
If very thick, a portion of water should be added to it, or the ^east 
would not ferment freely. The better plan is to dilute it with a 
quarter of a pint or rather more of warm water, and when it is suffi- 
aently risen to make up the buns lightly, like bread, with the cream.

half to a whole ounce of butter to the pound kneaded into it after it 
has risen. Break the butter small, spread out the dough a little, 
knead it in well and equally, and leave it for about half an hour to 
rise ; then roll it a quarter of an inch thick, pride it wdl all over, 
cut out the biscuits, and bake them in a moderate oven from ten to 
fifteen minutes : they should be crisp quite through, but not deeply 
coloured. 

White-bread dough, 2 lbs. ; butter, 1 to 2 oz. : to rise } hour 
Baked in moderate oven 10 to 15 minutes. 

Obs,— To make the biscuits by themselves, proceed as fbr Bordyke 
bread ; but use new milk for them, and work three ounces of butter 
into two pounds of flour before the yeast is added. 

EXCELLENT SODA BUNS. 

Work into half a pound of flour three ounces of butter, until it is 
ouite in crumbs ; mix thoroughly with them four ounces of sugar, 
ute slightest pinch of salt, an ounce, or rather more, of candoed 
orange or lemon rind, shred extremely small, and a little grated nut- 
meg ; to these pour boiling a smaU teacupful of cream, or of mUk 
when this cannot be had; mix them a little, and add immediately 
two egga, leaving out the white of one, and when the whole is well 
mingled, dust over, and beat well into it, less than half a teaspoonful 
of good carbonate of soda, perfectly free from lamps ; rub an oveu- 
tin with butter, drop the buns upon it with a spoon, and send them 
to a moderate oven. When they are firm to the touch in every part, 
and well coloured underneath, they are done. They resemble good 
cakes, if properly made, although in reality thejr are not rich : to 
render them so the proportion of sugar and of butter can be in- 
creased, and currants added also. It is immaterial, we find, whether 
thpy be put into the oven as soon as they are mixed, or an hour 
afterwards. They are equally light These proportions make just 
a dozen of small buns. 

Flour, i lb.; butter, 3 oz.; sugar, 4 oz.; candied orange-rind^ 
1 oz. or more; crated nutmeg; cream (or milk) 1 small teacupful; 
egg-yolks 2, white 1 ; good carbonate of soda about the third of a tea- 
spoonful; 15 to 25 minutes, moderate oven.

Citron. 
TO CLARIFr BUOAR. 

It II an economy to use at once the very best suear for oonfisctionaiy 
in general, for when highly refined it needs little or no danfyin^ 
even for the most delicate purposes ; and the coarser kinds lose con* 
siderable weight in the process. Break it into large lumps, and put 
it into a very dean preserying pan ; measure for each pound a pint 
of spring water if it be intended for eyrvLp^ but less tnan half that 
quantity for candying or making barley-sugar. Beat first apart (but 
not to a strong froth), and afterwards with the water, about half the 
white of an eg^ for six pounds of sugar, unless it should be very com- 
mon, when twice as much may be used. When, they are well mixed 
pour them over the sugar, and let it stand until it is nearly dissolved ; 
then stir the whole thoroughly, and place it over a gentle fire, but do 
not disturb it after the scum begins to gather on the top ; let it boil 
for five minutes, then take the pan from the fire, and when it has 
stood a couple of minutes clear off the scum entirdy, with a skiromer; 
set the pan again over the fire, and when the sugar b^^ to boil

Ihrow in a little cold water, which has been reserred for the purpoM 
from the quantity first measured, and repeat the skimming until the 
syrup is yery dear ; it may then be stramed through a muslin, or a 
tnin doth, and put into a dean pan for Airther boiling. 

Forsyrup: sugar, 6 lbs.; water, 3 quarts; ) white of 1 egg. For 
candying, &c : sugar, 6 lbs. ; water, 2} pints : 5 to 10 minutes. 

TO BOIL BUOAR FROM SYRUP TO CANDT, OR TO CARAMEL. 

The technicalities by whidi confectioners distinguish the different 
degrees of sugar-boiling, seem to us calculated raUier to puzzle than 
to assist the liader ; and we shall, therefore, confine oursefyes to such 
plain English terms as may suffice, we hope, to explain them. After 
nayiuff boiled a certain time, the length of whidi will in a measure 
depend upon the quality of the sugar as wdl as on the quantity of 
water adaed, it becomes a thin syrup, and will scaredy form a short 
thread if a drop be pressed between the thumb and finger and they 
are then drawn apart ; from fiye to ten minutes more of rapid boiling 
will bring it to a ihick syrup, and when this degree is reached the 
thread may be drawn from one hand to the other at some length 
without breaking ; but its appearance in dropping from the skimmer 
will perhaps best denote its Ming at this pomt, as it hangs in a sort 
of string as it falls. Afrer this the sugar will soon b^^ to whiten, 
and to K>rm large bubbles in the pan, when, if it be intended for 
barley-sujgar, or caramel, some lemon-iuice or other add must be 
added to it, to preyent its graining or becoming su^ar again; but if 
wanted to candy, it must be stimd without ceasing imtil it rises 
almost to the top of the pan, in one large white mass, when it must 
be used immediately or laded out into paper cases or on to dishes, 
with the utmost expedition, as it passes m an instant almost, from 
this state to one in which it forms a sort of powder, which will render 
it necessary to add water, to stir it until dissdyed, and to reboil it to 
the proper point. For barley-sunir likewise it must be constantly 
stirred, and carefully watched after the lemon-juice is added. A 
small quantity should be dropped from time to time into a large 
basin of cold water by those who are inexperienced in the process ; 
when in falling into this it makes a bubbling noise, and if taken out 
immediately after, it snaps clean between the teeth without sticking 
to them, it must be poured out instantly : if wanted for sugar-spin- 
ninf , the pan must be plunged as quickly as possible into a yessel of 
cold water 

CARAMEL. 

(7^ quickest way,) 

Put into a brass skillet, or preserying-pan, some sifted sugar of the 
finest quality, and stir it softly with a wooden spoon or spatula, oyer 



564 MODEBN* COOKEET. [chap. xxm. 

a yery gentle fire until it has become liqnid ; a pale or a deep tint 
may then be given to it, according to the purpose for which it is re- 
auired : so soon as it is entirely melted, and looks dear, it is ready 
for use. Pastry-cooks glaze sniall pastry by just dipping the sur&ee 
into it ; and they use it also for turugaty and other confectionaiy, 
though it is not in general quite so brilliant as that which is made by 
the preceding receipt When the sugar first begins to.melt, it should 
be stirred omy just in that part, or it will not be equally coloured. 

BARLEY-SUGAB. 

Add to three pounds of highly-refined sugar one pint and a <|uarter 
of sprine water, with sufficient white of egg to clarify it m tiie 
manner directed in the last paf;e but one; pour to it, when it b^;in9 
to whiten, and to be yery thick, a dessertspoonful of the stnimed 
juice of a i^resh lemon ; and boil it quickly until it is at the point 
which we haye indicated above. A few drops of essence of lemon 
may be added to it, just as it is taken from the nre. Pour it on to a 
marble slab, or on to a shallow dish which has been slightly oiled, or 
rubbed with a particle of fresh butter ; and when it b^ins to harden 
at the edges form it into sticks, lozenges, balls, or any other sNapes at 
pleasure. While it is still liquid it may be used for various purposes, 
such as Chantilly baskets, palace bonbons, eroqucmtes^* cerites am 
carcanelf &c. : for these the vessel containing it must be set into a pan 
of water, and it must again be liquefied with a veiy gentle d^;ree of 
heat diould it cool too quickly. As it soon dissolves if exposed to 
damp, it should be put mto very dry canisters as socn as it is oold, 
and these should be Kept in a dry place. 

B^ sugar, 8 lbs. ; water, 1^ pint; white of egg, i of 1 ; lemon- 
juiee, 1 dMsertspoonful. 

NOUaAT. 

This is a preparation of barley sugar, and almonds, filberts, or 
pistachio-nuts, or which good cc ; Jectioners, both foreign and English, 
make a great variety of nighly ornamental dishes. We must, how- 
ever, confine our directions to the most common and simple n: ^e of 
serving it. Blanch twelve ounces of fijie Jordan almonds in the 
usual way, wipe them very dry, split them in halves, and spread 
them upon tins or dishes ; diy them in a veiy gentle oven, without 
allowing them to brown; or if the flavour be liked better so, let 
them be equally coloured to a pale gold tint : they should then be 
often turned while in the oven. BoU to barley sugar in a small 
preserving-pTxa six ounces of highly-refined sugar, th^w in the 
almonds, mix them with it well without breaking them, turn the

noiiffat on to a dish slightly rubbed with oil, spread it out quickly, 
marK it into squares, and cut it before it is cold ; or pour it into a 
mould, and with an oiled lemon spread it quickly, and very thin oyer 
it, and turn it out when cool. It must at aU times be carefully pre- 
senred from damp ; and should be put into a dry tin box as soon as 
it is cold. 

Sugar, 6 oz. ; almonds, 12 oz. 

Another and more expeditious way of making it, is to boil iie 
sugar to caramel without any water, as directed at page 563 : the 
proportion of almonds can be diminished at pleasure, but the nougat 
should always be well filled with them. 

OmGER CANDY. 

Break a pound of highly-refined sugar into lumps, put it into a 
presenring-pan, and pour over it about the third of a pmt of spring 
water; let it stand until the sugar is nearly dissolved, then set it 
over a perfectly clear fire, and boil it until it becomes a thin syrup. 
Have ready in a large cup a teaspoonful of the very best ginger m 
powder ; mix it smoothly and gradually with two or three spoonsful 
of the syrup, and then stir it well into the whole. Watch the mix- 
ture carefully, keep it stirred, and drop it oflen from a spoon to 
ascertain the exact point of boiling it has reached. When it begins 
to fall in flakes, throw in the freshly-grated rind of a very lai^e 
lemon, or of two small ones, and work the sugar round quickly as it 
is added. The candy must now be stirred constantly until it is done : 
this will be when it falls in a mass from the spoon, and does not 
tink when placed in a small heap on a dish. It must be poured, or 
laded out, as expeditiously^ as possible when ready, or it will &11 
quite into powder. If this should happen, a little water must be 
added to it, and it must be reboiled to the proper point. The candy, 
if dropped in cakes upon sheets of very dry foolscap or other thick 
writinff-paper laid upon cold dishes, may be moved off without 
difficuuy while it is still just warm, but it must not be touched while 
quite hot, or it will breax. 

Sugar, hijghly refined, 1 lb. ; water, J of a pint ; ginger, 1 tea- 
spooziful ; rind of 1 large lemon. 

OBANOE-FLOWER CANDT. 

Beat in three-auarters of a pint, or rather more, of water, about 
the fourth part of the white of an egff, and pour it on two pounds of 
the best sugar broken into lumps. When it has stood a httle time, 
place it over a very clear fire, and let it boil for a few minutes, then 
set it'on one side, imtil the scum has subsided ; dear it off, and boil 
the sugar until it is very thick, then strew in by degrees three ounces 
of the peUds of the orange-blossom, weighed after they are picked

Obi. — ^When sugar of the finest quality is used for this coDfetdaOt

OBANGE-FLOWSR CANDY. 

{AnoAer Receipt.) 

The French, who are very fond of the delicious flavour of the 
orange-blossom, leave the petals in the candy; but a more delicate 
confection, to English taste, is made as follows :— Throw the orai^ge- 
flowers into the syrup when it has boiled about ten minutes, and 
after they havo sunmered in it for five more, pour the whole out, 
and leave them to inAise until the following &y, or even lon^, 
if more convenient ; then bring the s^rup to the point of boilmg^ 
strain it from the blossoms through a muslin, and finish it by the 
foregoing receipt. 

COCOA-NUT CANDY. 

Basp very fine a sound firesh cocoa-nut, spread it on a ^Lsh, and 
let it dry naturally for two or three days, as it will not bear the 
heat of an oven, and is too oily for use when freshly broken. Is our 
ounces of it wiU be sufficient for a pound of sugar for most tastes, 
but more can be used at pleasure. IBoil the sugar as for the orange* 
flower candy, and when it begins to be very thick and white, strew in 
the nut, stir and mix it toell^ and do not quit it for an instant until 
it is finished. The pan should not be placed upon the fire but over 
ft, as the nut is liable to bum with too fierce a heat. 

For almond-candy proceed in exactly the same way, but let the 
almonds, either whole or spli^ be perfectly well dried in a gentle 
oven, and do not throw them into tne sugar until it approaches the 
candying point 

• Ab the hett of the boiling sogir would ii^ure these, no good ones should bi 
isad tor the pnzpoee.

PALACE-BONBONS. 

Take some fine fresh candied orange-rind, or citron, dear off the 
sugar which adheres to it, cut it into inch-squares, stick these sinsly on 
the prong of a silver fork or on osier-twigs, dip them into liquid 
harley-sugar, and pkce them on a dish rubbed with the smaUest 
possible quantity of veiy pure salad oil. When cold, put them into 
tin boxes or canisters well dried, with paper, which snould also be 
very dry, between each layer. 

ETBRTON TOFPIE. 

No. 1. — Put into a brass skillet or small j^reserving pan three 
ounces of veiy fresh butter, and as soon as it is just melted add a 
pound of brown suffar of moderate quality; keep these stirred 
gently over a very dear fire for about fifteen minutes, or until a 
little of the mixture, dropped into a basin of cold water, breaks dean 
between the teeth without sticking to them : when it is boiled to this 
point, it must be poured out immediately, or it will bum. The 
^ted rind of a lemon, added when the toffie is half done, improves 
It much ; or a small teaspoonful of powdered ginger moistened widi 
a little of the other ingredients as soon as the sugar is dissolved a^ 
then stirred to the whole, will varv it pleasantly to many tastes 
The real Everton toffie is made with a much larger proportion of 
butter, but it is the less wholesome on that very account u dropped 
upon dishes first rubbed with a buttered paper, the toffie when cold 
can be raised from them easily. 

Butter, 3 oz.; sugar, 1 lb.: 15 to 18 minutes. Or, sugar, 1 lb.; 
butter, 6 oz. ; almonds, 2 oz. : 20 to 30 minutes. 

No. 2.— Boil together a pound of sugar and five ounces of butter 
for twenty minutes; then stir in two ounces of almonds blanched, 
divided, and thoroughly dried in a slow oven, or before the fire. 
Let the toffie boil after they are added, till it crackles when dropped 
into cold water, and snaps between the teeth without sticking. 

Sugar, 1 lb. ; butter, 6 oz. ; almonds, 2 oz. : 20 to 30 minutes. 

CHOCOLATE DROPS. 

Throw into a well heated metal mortar from two to four ounces <^ 
the best quality of oske-chocolate broken small, and pound it with a 
warm pestle until it resembles a smooth paste or very thick batter ; 
then add an equal weight of sugar in the finest powder, and beat 
them until they are thoroughly blended. Roll the mixture into 
small baUs, lay them upon sheets of writing paper or upon dean 
dishes, and tdce them off when they are nearly cold. The tops may 
be covered with white nonpareil comfits, or the drops may be shaken 
in * paper containing some of these, and entirdy encrusted with

them ; but it must be recollected that they will not adhere to them 
a^r they become hard. More or less su^r can be worked iato the 
chocolate according to the taste ; and a Wedgewood mortar may be 
used for it when no other is at hand, but one of bell-metal will 
answer the purpose better. 

CHOCOLATE ALMONDS. 

When the chocolate has been softened, and mixed with an eonal 
Droportion of sugar, f^ directed in the foregoing receipt, enclose 
£igly in small portions of it some almonds previously well dxied, or 
even slightly coloured in the oven, after having been blanched. 
Roll them very smooth in the hand, and cover them with the com- 
fits, or form them like the almond shamrocks of page 574. f^berts 
and pistachio-nuts may be substituted for the almonds with good 
effibct ; but they also must be perfiectly dry. 

SEYILLB ORANGE PASTE. 

Wipe, and pare in the thinnest possible strips, some Seville 
orange-rinds, and throw them into plenty of boiling water. When 
ihey are extremely tender, lift them on to a large sieve reversed to 
drain ; press the water from them a little, and before they are quite 
cold, pound them to the smoothest paste, and blend thoroughly with 
them as much fine sifted sugar as can possibly be mixed with them. 
Roll the mass out extremely thin, and with a very small tin-cutter 
form it into cakes or leaves, or anv other shapes, and then dry it in a 
VERT gentle oven. Store it in close-shuttixiff boxes as soon as it is 
cold. A little choice prepared ginger may oe added to it in the 
pounding when it is liked. 

Paste of lemon or citron-rind may be made in the same way.

DESSERT DISHES. 

A wsLL-ssLECTSD and well-arran'ged dessert, however simple in its 
character, may always be rendered agreeable to the eye and to the 
taste: but in no department of the table can so much that is 
attractive to both be more readily combined ; and at the present day 
an unusual degree of luxury is often displayed in it, the details of 
which, however, would be out of place here. Forced strawberries of 
magnificent size, and of the best varieties, brought by culture and 
management all to perfection on the same day, and served on their 
plants, in the pots in which they are grown, concealed in others of 
porcelain or of chased silver, are amongst the expensive novelties now 
commonly introduced at costly dinners of display, and may serve as 
an illustration of it * 

• To these may be added miniatore frtut trees in loll bearing placed down ths 
osntre of the table, and intezmingled with the choicest axotios. 



570 MOBERir COOKS&T. [CHAF. xxnxL 

For edouiioii oecsaons, a few dishes of really fresh finit tastefully 
disposed and embedded in hvge green leaves, will be all that is le- 
o uired for a plain summer or autumn dessert ; and at other parts of 
tne year such as are appropriate to the season ; but from the immense 
Tariety of cakes, biscmte, confections, ices, bonbon*^ and other sucreriet 
(some of them extremely brilliant in appearance), and of fruit native 
and foreign, fresh, dried, and preserred in every possible manner 
which are adapted to them, desserts may be servea in any kind of 
5tyle. 

PEARLED FBUIT, OB FRUIT EN CHEMISE. 

Select for this dish very fine bunches of red and white currants, 
large ripe cherries, and gooseberries of difierent colours, and straw- 
berries or raspberries very freshly gathered. Beat up the white of 
an ^g with about half as much cold water, dip the fruit into this 
mixture, drain it on a sieve for an instant, and then roll it in fine 
sifted su^ until it is covered in every put ; give it a sentle shake, 
and lay it on sheets of white paper to drv. In England, thin gum- 
water IS sometimes used, we believe, for this dish, instead of the white 
ofegff; we nve, however, the French method of preparing it. It 
will cLry graaually in a warm room, or a sunny window, in the course 
«f three or four hours. 

Obi. — ^This is an inexpensive dish, which if well preuared has the 
appearance of fine confectionary. The incrustation or sugar much 
increases too the apparent size of the fruit. That which is used for it 
should be of the best quality, and fine and dry. When it beoomes 
moist from the fruit being rolled in it, it will no longer adhere to it 
as it ought 

8AI.AD OF MIXED SUMMER FRUITS. 

Heap a dessert-dish ouite high with alternate layers of fine fresh 
strawberries stripped from the stalks, white and red currants, and 
white or red raspberries; strew each layer plentifully with oiled 
sugar, and just before the dish is sent to table, pour equally over the 
top two wineglaasesf ul of sherry, Madeira, or any other good white 
wme. Very thick Devonshire cream may be Itud entirely over the 
fruit, instead of the wine being mingled with it Currants by them- 
-selves are excellent prepared in this way, and strawberries also. The 
fruit should be gently stirred with a spoon when it is served. £adi 
variety must be picked with great nicety from the stalks. 

FBACH SALAB. 

Fare and slioe half a dozen fine ripe peaches, arrange them in a 
dish, strew them with pounded sugar, and pour over them two or 
three glasses of champagne : other wine may be uaed, but this is best 
Persons who prefer brandy can substitute it for wine. The quantity 
of sugar must be proportioned to the sweetness of the fruit 



CHAP. ZZTin.] DSS8KBX DISHES. 571 



ORANGE SALAD. 

Take off the outer rinds, and then strip awa^ entirely the white 
inside skin from some fine China oranges; shce them thin, and 
remove the seeds, and thick skin of the cores, as this is done ; strew 
•over them plenty of white sifted sugar, and pour on them a glass or 
more of brandy : when the sugar is dissolved serve the oranges. In 
Prance ripe pears of superior quality are sometimes sliced up with 
the oranges. Powdered sugar-candy used instead of sugar, is an 
improvement to this salad ; and the substitution of port, sherry, or 
Madeira, for the brandy is often considered so. The fruit may be 
used without being pared, and a little cvraqao or any other liqueur 
may be added to the brandy; or this last, when unmixed, may be 
burned after it is poured on the oranges. 

TANGERINE ORANGES. 

These beautiful little oranges, of which the rinds have a most 
peculiar, and to many tastes not a verjr agreeable flavour, are re- 
markably sweet and delicate when in their perfection ; but they come 
later into the market than the more common varieties of the orange, 
and disappear from them sooner. ^ Thev make a very refined salad, 
and also an ornamental dessert dish : their cost is somewhat higher 
than that of the Malta and St. Michael oranges. 

There is another species of this fruit known commonly as the 
hbod'orcoige which has many admirers, but it is not we should say 
greatly superior to the more abundant kinds usually served at our 
tobies. 

PEACHES IN BRANDT. 

(Botierdam Beceipt.) 

Prepare and stew some fine full-flavoured peaches by the receipt 
of page 459, but with two ounces more of susar to the half pint of 
water ; when they are tender put them, with uieir syrup, into glass 
or new stone jars, which they should only half fill ; and when they 
are quite cold pour in white, or very pale, French brandy to within 
an inch and a half of the brims : a few peach or apricot kernels can 
be added to them. The jars must be corKed down. 

BRANDIED MORELLA CHBRRnS. 

Let the cherries be ripe, freshly gathered, and the finest that can be 
had ; cut off half the length of the stalks, and drop them gently into 
clean dry quart bottles with wide necks; leave in each sufficient 
Vpace for four ounces of pounded white sugar-candy (or of brown, if 
iSetter liked); fill them up entirely with the best f'rench bflrandy,

BAKKD C0Up6tB OF APPLES. 

(Our UtOe lady's receipt.) 

Pat into a wide Nottingham jar, with a coyer, two qnaits of 
golden pippins, or of the small apple which resembles them in 
appearance, called the orange pippin (this is yeij plentifrtl in the 
county of Kent), pared and cored, but without bemg diyided; strew 
amongst them some small strips of yexy thin fresh lemon-rind, throw 
on them, nearly at the top, half a pound of good Lisbon sugar, aind 
set the jar, with the coyer tied on, for some hours, or for a n^ht, 
into a yery slow oyen. The apples wiQ be extremely good, if not too 
quickly baked : they should remain entire, but be p^-fectly tender, 
and clear in appearance. Add a little lemon-juice wnen the season is 
far adyanced. 

Apples, 2 quarts ; rind, quite small lemon ; sugar, i lb. : 1 night 
in slow oyen ; or some hours baking in a very gentle one. 

Obe. — These apples may be serf ^ hot as a second course dish ; or 
cold, with a boiled custard poured round or oyer them. They will 
Ukewise answer admirably to fill OabrieUe*e pudding, or a vol-au^vaU 
dlaereme, 

DRIBD NORFOLK BIFFINS. 

The Norfolk biffin is a hard and yery red apple, the flesh of the 
true kind beixiff partially red as well as the skin. It is most exod- 
lent when careluUy driea ; and much finer we should say when left 
more juicy and but partly flattened, than it is when prepared for 
sde. Wipe the apples, arrange them an inch or two apart, and 
place them in a yery gentle oyen until they become so much softened 
as to yield easily to suffident pressure togiye them the form of 
smidl cakes of less than an inch thick. They must be set seyeral 
times into die oyen to produce this effect, as they must be gradually 
flattened, and must not be allowed to burst : a cool brick oyen is best 
suited to them. 

NORMANDT PIPPINS. 

To one pound of the apples, put one quart of water and six ounces 
of sugar; let them simmer gently for three hours, or more should 
they not be perfectly tender. A few strips of fresh lemon-peel and a 
yery few doyes are by some persons considered agreeable additions to 
tiie syrup.

as they are light and swell much in the stewing, will be sufficient to 
serve at once. Rinse them quickly with cold water, and then soak 
them for an hour in the pan in which they are to be stewed, in a 
quart of fresh water ; place them by the side of the stove to heat 
gradually, and when they begin to soften add as much sugar as will 
sweeten them to the taste : they require but a small portion. Lemon- 
rind can be added to them at pleasure. We have many receipts for 
other ways of preparing them, to which we cannot now give pla<^ 
here. It answers well to bake them slowly in a covered jar. The;f 
may be served hot in a border of rice. 

8TEWED PBTJNEAUX DE TOURS, OB TOURS DRIED PLUMS. 

These plums, which resemble in form small dried Norfolk biffins, 
make a delicious compSte: they are also excellent served dry. In 
France they are stewed untQ tender in equal parts of water, and of 
the light red wine of the country, with about four ounces of suffar 
to the ^und of fruit : when port wine is used for them a smaller 
proportion of it will suffice. The sugar should not be added in stew- 
inff any dried fruits until they are at least half-done, as they will not 
semen W any means so easily in flyrnp as in unsweetened liquid. 

Dried plums, 1 lb. ; water, } pmt, and light daret, ^ pint, or 
water, { pmt, and port wine, ^pint: 1^ hour. Sugar, 4 oz. : 2 hours, 
or more. 

Obs. — Common French plums are stewed in the same way with 
or without wine. A little experience will teach the cook the exact 
quantity of liquid and of sugar which they require. 

TO BAKE PEARS. 

Wii>e some large sound iron pears, arrange them on a dibli with 
the stalk end upwards, put them into the oven after the bread is 
withdrawn, and let them remain all night. If well l)aked, they will be 
excellent, very sweet, and juicy, and much finer in flavour than 
those which are stewed or baked with sugar : the ban ehrtien pear 
also is delicious baked thus. 

STEWED PEARS. 

Pare, cut in halves, and core a dozen fine pears, put them into a 
close shutting stewnan with some thin strips Oi lemon -rind, half a 
pound of sugar in lumps, as much water as will nearljr cover them, 
and should a very bright colour lie desired, a dozen grains of cochi- 
neal, bruised, and tied in a m islin ; stew the fruit as gently as pos-

SOILED CHESTNUTS. 

Make a slight indsion in the outer skin only, of each chestnut, to 
prevent itsbursting, and when all are done, tlurow them into plentv 
of boiling water, with about a dessertspoonful of salt to the hafr 
gallon. Some chestnuts will require to be boiled nearly or quite 
an hour, others little more than half the time: the cook should 
try them occanonally, and as soon as they are soft through, drain 
them, wipe them in a coarse cloth, and send them to table quiddy in 
a hot napkin. 

06tf.— The best chestnuts are those which have no internal di- 
visions : the finest kinds are quite entire when shelled. 

ROASTED CHESTNUTS. 

The best mode of preparing these is to roast them, as in Spain, in 
a ooffee-roaster, after having first boiled them from seven to ten 
minutes, and wiped them dry. They should not be allowed to oool,. 
and will require but from ten to fifteen minutes* roasdng. They 
may, when more convenient, be fimshed over the fire as usmd, or in 
a f)utch or common oven, but in all cases the previous boiling will 
be found an improvement. Never omit to cut the rind of each nut 
slightly before it is cooked. Serve the chestnuts very hot in a nap* 
kin, and send salt to table with them. 

ALMOND SHAVROCKS. 

Whisk the white of a very fresh egg to a froth sufficiently solid to 
remain standing in high points when dropped from the whiak ; work 
into it from huf to three-quarters of a pound of very fine dry sifled 
sugar, or more should it be needed, to bring the mixture to a con- 
sistency in which it can be worked with the fingers. Have ready 
some fine Jordan almonds which have been blanched, and thoroughly 
dried at the month of the oven ; roll each of these in a small portion 
of the icing until it is equally covered, and of good form ; then lay 
them 9U sheets of thick writing paper, placing three together in the fiirm 
of the shamrock, or trefoil, with a small bit of sugar twisted from the 
centre almond to form the stalk. When aU are ready, set them 
into a very slow oven for twenty minutes or longer: they should 
become quite firm without taking any colour. They make an ex- 
cellent and very ornamental dish. To give them flavour and variety, 
use for them sugar which has been rasped on the rinda of 



CHAP, zxvm.] DESSERT DISHES. 575 

sound lemons, or Seyille oranges, or upon citron, and dried before it 
is reduced to powder ; or add to the mixture a drop of essence of 
roses, and a slight colouring of prepu^d cochineaL A little spinach- 
juice will give a beautiful green tint, but its flavour is not yeiy 
agreeable. Filbert or pistachio nuts will answer as well as almonds, 
iced in this way. 

SMALL SUGAR SOUFFLis. 

These are made with the same preparation of egg and sugar as the 
almond-shamrocks, and may be flavoured and coloured in the same 
way. The icing must be sufficiently firm to roll into balls scarcely 
larger than a nut : a little sifted sugar should be dusted on the 
fingers in making them, but it must not remain on the surface of the 
souffles. They are baked usually in very small round paper cases, 
plait^ with the edge of a knife, and to give them bnlliancv, the tops 
are slightly moistened before they are set into the oven, by passing 
the finger, or a paste-brush, just dipped in cold water, lightly over 
them. Look at tnem in about a quarter of an hour, and should they 
be quite firm to the touch in every part, draw them out; but if not 
let them remain longer. They may be baked on sheets of paper, but 
will not preserve their form so welL 

For 1 white of egg, whisked to a very firm firoth, 8 to 10 oz. of 
sifted sugar, or more : souffles^ baked in extremely gentle oven, 16 to 
30 minutes, or longer if needful. « 

Ohs, — We have confined our receipts here to the most simple pre 
parations suited to desserts. All the confectionary of the preceding 
chapter being appropriate to them (with the exception of tne toffie), 
as well as various campdtes, clear jellies, and gateaux of fruit turned 
from the moulds; and we have already enumerated the many other 
dishes of which they may be composed. 

ICES. 

There is no real difficulty in making 
ices for the table ; but for want of the 
proper means of freezing them, and of 
preventing their beinff acted on by a too 
warm atmosphere afterwards, in many 
houses it cannot very easily be accom« 
plished unless the weather be extremely 
cold. 

A vessel called a freezing-pot, an ice- 
pail, a strong wooden mallet, and a copper 

spatula, or an ice-spoon, are all that is , «_„ ^,, 

positively required Ifor this branch of ice PaU and Freerer. 

confectionary. Suitable moulds for iced 

puddings, and imitations of fruit, must be had in addition when 

needed. 




676 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. xxTm. 

When the composition which is to be frozen is ready, the rongh 
ice must be beaten quite small with the mallet, and either mingled 
quickly with two or three handsful of powdered saltpetre, or nsed 
with a much larger quantity of salt. The freezing-pot must then be 
firmly placed in the centre of the ice, which must be pressed 
closely into the vacant space around it until it reaches the top. The 
cover of the ice-pot, or freezer, may then be removed, and the 

E reparation to be iced poured into it It should then be tamed 
y means of the handle at the top^ quickly backwards and forwards 
for eight or ten minutes ; then the portion which vrill have firozen to 
the inside must be scraped well from it with the ice-spoon and 
mingled with the remainder : without this the mass would be full of 
lumps instead of being perfectly smooth as it ou^ht to be. The same 
process must be continued until the whole of its contents are uni- 
formly frozen. 

The water-ices which are made in such perfection on the oontinenti 
are incomparably superior to the ice-creams, and other sweet composi- 
tions whicn are usually served in preference to them here. One or two 
receipts which we append will serve as guides for many others, which 
may easUy be compounded with any varietv of fresh summer fruit.* 

Red Uurrant Ice. — Strip from the stalks and take two pounds 
weight of fine ripe currants and half a pound of raspberries ; rub 
them through a fine sieve, and mingle thoroue^hly witn them suffi- 
cient cold syrup to render the mixture agreeably sweet, and, — ^unless 
the pure flavour of the fruit be altoffether preferred,— add the 
strained juice of one large or of two smalllemons, and proceed at once 
to freeze the mixture as above. 

Currants, 2 lbs. ; raspberries, i lb.; sugar, ) to 1 lb. ; boiled for 6 
or 8 minutes in J pint of water and lefl till quite cold. (Juice of 
lemon or lemons at pleasure.) 

Strawberry and raspberry water-ices are made in precisdy the 
same manner. 

To convert any of these into English ice-creams, merely mingle 
the juice and pulp of the fruit with sufficient pounded sugar to 
sweeten them, or with the syrup as above, and then blend with them 
CTadually from a pint and a half to a quart of fresh sweet cream, and 
tne lemon-juice or not at choice. The QueeiCs Custard^ ike Currant^ 
and the Quince or Apple Custard of pages 481 and 482 may idl be 
converted into good ices with a little addition of cream and sugar ; 
and so likewise may the Countess Cream of page 472, and the 
Bavarian Cream of page 477| by omitting the isinglass from either 
of them. 

* The ices for desserts sbctild be moulded in the form of fruit or other shapes 
adapted to the purpose ; the natural flavour and colouring are then gireu to the 
former, but it is only experienced cooks or confectioners generallj who under- 
stand this branch of ice-making, and it is better left to them. All the necessary 
moulds may be procured at any good ironmongers, where the manner of using 
them would be ezplaained : we can give no more space to the subject.

Antique Wine Vue. 



STRAWBERRY YnnBGAR, OF DELICIOUS FLAVOUR. 

Takx the stalks from the fimit which should be of a highly flavonred 
sort, quite ripe, fresh from the beds, and ^thered In dry weather ; 
weigh and put it into large ^lass jars, or wide-necked bottles, and to 
each pound pour about a pmt and a half of fine pale white wine 
Tineffar, which will answer the purpose better tlum the entirely co- 
lourless kind sold under the name of distiUed vinegar^ but which is 
often, we believe, merely pvroligneous acid greatly diluted.* Tie a 
thick paper over them, and let the strawberries remain from three to 
four days ; then pour off the vinegar and empty them into a jelly- 
bag, or suspend them in a cloth, that all the hquid may drop from 
them without pressure ; replace them with an equal weight of fresh 
fruit, pour the vinecar upon it, and three days afterwards repeat the 
same process, diminishing a little the proportion of strawberries, of 
which the flavour ought ultimately to overpower that of the vinegar. 

^ For these fine acidulated froii-STnips Tinegar of the purest quality, but only 
of medivm strength, is zequizvd.

In ftom two to four days drain off the liqtiid very closely, and after 
haying strained it through a linen or a flannel bag, weigh it, and mix 
with it an equal quantity of highly-refined sugar roughly powdered ; 
when this is nearly dissolved, stir the syrup over a very clear fire 
until it has boiled for five minutes, and skim it ikorov^hly ; pour it 
into a delicately clean stone pitcher, or into large china jugs, throw a 
thick folded cloth over and let it remain until the morrow. Pot 
it into pint or half-pint bottles, and cork them lightly with new velvet 
corks ; for if these be pressed in tightly at first, the bottles will same- 
times burst : * in four or five days they may be closely corked, and 
stored in a dry and cool ^huce. Damp destroys the colour and injures 
the flavour of these fine fruit- vinegars, of which a spoonful or two 
in a glass of water affords so agreeable a summer bevera^ and one 
which, in many cases of illness, is so acceptable to invahds. Tbey 
make also most admirable sauces for her Majesty*s pudding, common 
custard, batter, and various other simple and sweet light puddings. 

Strawberries (stalked), 4 lbs.; vmegar, 3 quarts: 3 to 4 days. 
Vinegar drained and poured on fresh strawbories, 4 lbs. : 3 days 
Drained asain on to fresh fruit, 3 to 4 lbs. : 2 to 4 days. To each 
pound of tne vinegar, 1 lb. of highly-refined sugar : boiled 5 minutes. 
iightly corked, 4 to 5 days. 

Obs, — ^Where there is a garden the firuit may be thrown into the 
vinegar as it ripens, within an interval of forty-eight hours, instead 
of being all put to infuse at once, and it must then remain in it a pro- 
portionate time : one or two days in addition to that specified will 
make no difference to the preparation. The enamelled stewpans are 
the best possible vessels to boil it in : but it may be simmered in a 
stone jar set into a pan of boiling water, when there is nothing more 
appropriate at hand; though the syrup does not usually keep so well 
when this last method is adopted. 

Raspberries and strawberries mixed will make a vine^ of very 
pleasant flavour ; black currants also will afford an exceedingly nadul 
syrup of the same kind 

VERY FINE RASPBBRBT VINEGAR. 

Fill glass jars or large wide-necked bottles, with very rix>e but per- 
fectly soimd freshly gathered raspberries, freed from their stalks, and 
cover them with pale white wine vinqi;ar : they may be lefb to infose 
from a week to ten days without injury, or the vinegar may be poured 
from them in four or five, when more convenient. After it is (uained 
off, turn the fruit into a sieve placed over a deep dish or bowl, as the 
juice will flow slowly from it for many hours ; put fresh raspberries 
inte the bottles, and pour the vinegar back upon them ; two or tlunee 
days later change the fruit again, and when it has stood the

re of time, drain the whole of the vinegar closely finom it, pass it 
ugh a jeUy-haff or thick linen cloth, and hoil it gently for four 
or five minutes with its weight of good sugar roughly powdered, or a 
pound and a quarter to the exact pint, and be very careful to remove 
the scum entirely as it rises. On the following day bottle the flymp, 
observing the directions which we have given for the strawberry 
vinegar. When the fruit is scarce it may l£ changed twice only, and 
left a few days longer in the vinegar. 

Baspberries, 6 lbs.; vinegar, 9 pints: 7 to 10 dinrs. Vinegar 
drained on to fresh raspberries (6 lbs. of) : 3 to 5 dlavs. Poured 
again on fresh raspberries, 6 lbs. : 3 to 5 days. Boiled 6 minutes 
with its "VTeight of sugar. 

Oft*.— When the process of sugar-boiling is well understood, it will 
be found an improvement to boil that which is used for raspberry or 
strawberry vinegar to candv height before the liquid is mixed with 
it ; all the scum may then be removed with a couple of minutes* sim- 
mering, and the flavour of the fruit will be more perfectly preserved. 
For more particular directions as to the mode of proceeding, the 
chapter of confectionary may be consulted. 

FINE CURRANT SYRUP, OR 8IR0P DB OROBEILLES. 

Express the juice from some fine ripe red currants, which have been 
gathered in dry weather, and stripped from the stalks ; strain, and 
put it into a new, or a perfectly cl^ and dry earthen pitcher, and 
let it stand in a cellar or in some cool place for twenty-four hours, or 
longer, should it not then appear perfectly curdled. Four it gently 
into a fine hair-sieve, and let the clear juice drain through without 
pressure ; pass it through a jelly-bag, or a closely-woven doth, weigh 
It, and add as much good sugar broken small as there is of the juice, 
and when this is dissolved turn the syrup into a preserving-pan or 
stewpan, and boil it gently for four or five minutes being careful to 
dear off all the scum. In twelve hours afterwards the syrup may be 
put into small dry bottles, and corked and stored in a cool, but dry 

Slace. It is a most agreeable preparation, retaining perfectly the 
avour of the fresh fruit; and mixed with water, it affords, like 
strawberry or raspberry vinegar, a delicious summer beverage, and 
one which is peculiarly adapted to invalids. It makes also a fine 
isinglass jelly, and an incomparable sweet-pudding sauce. A portion 
of raspberry or cherry-juice may be mixed with that of the currants 
at pleasure. 

CHERRT-BRANDT.

and then as much good French brandy as will oover the fruity and 
reach to the necks of the bottles. Ck)rk them securely, and let them

from the cherries will be excellent, and the fruit itself very good.

preferred to this.

O^.— Bishop is frequently made with a Seville orange stack with 
cloves and slowly roasted, and its flavour to many tastes is infinitely 
finer than that of the lemon. 

CAHBRIBGB MILK PUNCH. 

Throw into two quarts of new milk the very thinly-pared rind of 
a fine lemon, and half a pound of ^ood sugar in lumps ; hring it 
slowly to hoil, take out the lemon-rmd, draw it from the fire, and 
stir quickly in a couple of well-whisked eggs which have^been mixed 
with less tnan half a pint of cold milk, and strained though a sieve; 
the milk must not of course be allowed to boil after these are mixed 
with it. Add gradually a pint of rum, and half a pint of brandy ; 
mill Uie punch to a froth, and serve it immediately with quite warm 
flassea. At the University the lemon-rind is usually omitted, but it 
IS a great improvement to the flavour of the beverage. The sugar 
and spirit can be otherwise apportioned to the taste ; and we would 
reconunend the yolks of three eggs, or of four, in preference to the 
two whole ones.

stir it gently until it is on the point of boiling only : it should then be 
serval immediately. The addition of a strip or two of orange- rind 
cut extremely thin, gives to this beverage the flavour of bishop. In 
France light claret takes the place of port wine in making it, and the 
better kinds of otn ordinaire are very palatable thus prepared.

a tablespoonful of it in a glass of water. It will keep a considerable

of citric add may be added when it is taken.

juf with boiling water and keep the mixture gently stirred for some 
nunutes ; then cover it down, and let it stand until perfectly cold. 
In twelve hours, or less, it will be fit for use; but it is better when 
made over night. If these directions be followed, the barley-water 
will be compaiativdy dear, and very soft and pleasant to dnnk. A 
glass ofcalrs feet jefiy added to the barley is an infinite improve- 
ment ; but as lemon-rind is often extremdy unpalatable to invalids, 
their taste should be consulted before that ingrcdient is added, as it 
should be also for the degree of sweetness that is desired. After the 
barley-water has been ^ured off once, the jug ma^ be filled with

So soon as the fermentation has entirely ceased, which may be in 
from six to seven weeks, press in the bung, and leave the wine 
untouched for twelve months; draw it off ibea into a clean cask,

tasted wine made by it which had been five years kept, and which so 
much resembled a rich foreign wine that we could with difficulty 
believe it was English-made.

Strip the berries, which should be ripe and finesh, and gathered on

large earthen pan. Four boiling water on them, in the nroportion 
of two nJlons to three of berries, press them down into toe liquor,

an ounce of doves, aod one ounce of ginger, for every gallon, and 
boil it twenty minutes, keeping it thoroughly skimmed. Put it, 
when somethmff more than mi&-warm, into a perfectly dry and 
sweet ottk (or if but a verjf small quantity of wme be made, into 
large stone bottles, which answer for the purpose quite well), fill 
this entirely, and pour very gently into the bung hole a lam 
spoonful of new yeast mixed with a very small quantity of the 
wine.

EXCELLENT OBANOB WIME* 

Take half a chest of SevUle oranges, pare off the rinds as thin aa 
possible, put two-thirds of them into six gallons of water, and let 
them remain for twenty-four hours. S<}ueeze the oranges (which 
ought to 3rield seven or eight quarts of jmce^ through a sieve into a

let them be washed well in it with the hands, and then put into 
another six gallons of water and left untQ the following day. For 
each gallon of wine, put into the cask three pounds and a quarter of 
loafsuffar, and the liquor strained clear from the rinds and pulp. 
Wash Siese again and again, should more liquor be re(juired to ml 
the cask; but do not at any time add raw water. Stir the wine 
daily until the sugar is perfectly dissolved, and let it ferment from 
four to five weeks ; ada to it two bottles of brandy, stop it down, 
and in twelve months it will be fit to bottle. 

Obs. — The excellence of all wine depends so much upon the 
fermentation being properly conducted, that unless the mode of 
regulating this be understood by the maker, there will always be 
great danger of &ilure in the operation. There is, we believe, an 
excellent work upon the subject by Mr. McCulloch, which the 
reader who needs information upon it will do well to consult : our 
own experience is too slight to enable us to multiply our receipts.

Rub a quarter of a pound of sucar upon the rinds of two fine

pint of water ; let these boil gently for two or three minutes, then 
pour in half a pint of China orazige-juice mixed with that of one lemon, 
and previously strained through muslin ; the moment this begins to 
boil, pour it into a hot jug, and stir to it half a pint of the best 
Cognac brandy. Serve it immediately. When preferred cold, 
prepare the syrup with the juice of the fVuit, cover it down in the 
.}ug, set it into ice, or into a very cool place, and add the spirit only 
just before the cup is wanted for table. Should the fruit be very 
acid, increase the proportion of sugar. A few slight strips of tlie

COFFEE. 

There is no beverage whicli is held in more nniversal esteem than 
good coffee, and none in this conntry at least, which is ohtained with 
greater difficulty (unless indeed it he pure wine). We hear constant 
and well-founded complaints both fix>m foreigners and Enfflish 
people, of the wretched compounds so commonly served up here 
under its name, especially in many lodging houses, hotels, and railway 
refreshment rooms;* yet nothing can well be easier than to pre- 
pare it properly. Some elaborate and various fanciful modes of

making it have been suggested at different times by writers fond of 
novelty, but they have in general nothing to recommend them be- 
yond the more simple processes which follow, and of which we be- 
lieve the result will seldom prove unsatisfactory to our readers, unless 
it be to such of them as may have been accustomed to the spioed or 
other peculiar Oriental preparations of the firagrant berry, or simply 
to the exquisite quality of it, which would appear to be obtainable 
only in the East ; or which, at all events, is beyond the reach of the 
mass of English consumers* and of their near Continental neighbours. 

TO BOAST COFFEE. 




Persons who drink coffee habitually, and who are very particular 
about its flavour and quality, should purchase the best kind in a raw 
state, keep it for two or three years if they are not certain that it has 
been so long harvested — as when new it is greatly inferior to that 
which has l^n kept— and have it roasted at home. 

This can be cheaply done in small quantities by means of the 
inexpensive apparatus shown above; the cost of it not exceeding 
seven or eight shillings, and the supply of charcoal needed for it 
being very trifling indeed ; or, with that inserted below, which is 
lai^r and about double the price. The cylinder which contains the 
coffee should be only half filled, and it should be turned* rather 
slowly over the fire, which should never be fierce, until a strong 
aromatic smell is emitted ; the movement should then be quickened, 
as the grain is in that case quite heated, and it will become too 
highly coloured before it is roasted through, if slowly finished. 
When it is of a fine, lights equal brown, whicn must be ascertained, 
nntil some little experience has been acquired, by sliding back tbt

A FEW OSNERAL DIRBCTIONS FOR MAKING COFFEE. 

When good coffee is desired, let it be procured if possible of a first- 
rate Ixmdon house* which can be depended on ; and we would re- 
commend that it should be of the finest quality that can be obtained ; 
for tiiere is no real economy in using that which ib nominally cheaper, 
as a larger quantity will be required to give the same amount of 
strength, and the nayour will be very inferior. It should alwa3r8 be 
freMy roasted; but when a constant and large demand for it exists, 

• We eoold indicate Boreral houses where unadalterated coSIm maybe procured, 
bat it is not always to be had from them bo choice in quality as it might be ; and 
it is in general too highly roasted. By far the finest we have erer tasted we had 
on two occasions, some years since, from Mr. Cobbett, of Pall Mall. The fr»> 
graace of it was too remarkable to be easily forgotten, and the flavour was exqui- 
site ; but it was apparently an accidental sample which he had met with in the 
market, for thougn very good, that with which we were supplied afterwards never 
equalled it. 

Messrs. Staniforth and Co., 188, Oxford-street, are deservedly noted for the 
excellence of their coffee. It is always ground at the instant of serving it to a 
customer; andthey have the complaisance of roasting even so small a quantity 
as two pounds, to suit the taste of the purchaser : it may therefore be procured 
of them as pakhdried as it can be wished. 

The house of Messrs. Decastro and Fea«h, next door to Hatohett's Hotel, 
Piccadilly, may likewise, we think, be ^uite depended on for supplying gonuine 
oofiiM to thf nublio ; and they have an immense demand for it. 



MODERN COOSEBT. [chap. XXX 

it win be easy to haye it bo. When it has been stored for any length 
d time it will be much freshened and improved by being gaitly 
heated through, either in the oren or in a stewpan held high above 
the fire. It should be often turned while it is warming, and eroaiid 
as soon as it is cold asnin. Never purchase it ready ground vxnkm 
compelled to do so. When no proper mill for it is fitted up in the 
house, a small portable one, which may be had at a trifling expense, 
will answer tolerably well for grinding it, though it cannot be used 
with quite the same fadiity as those which are fiutened firmly to t 
wall ; but whatever form of mill may be used it should be arranged 
so as to reduce the berries to a moderately fine powder; for if it be 
too coarse the essence will be only partially extracted from it by 
filtering ; and if it be extremely fine the water will not percolate 
throng it, and it will not be dear. 

We say nothing about mingling chicory with it Our directions 
are for making pure coffee; whicl^ when not taken in excess, is, we 
believe, a wholesome as well as a most agreeable beverage. The 
effect dT chicory is, we believe, to impart a d^ht bitter flavour to the 
infusion, and to deepen its colour so much as to make it appear mudi 
stronger than it reauy is True connoisBenis, however, do not attach 
any importance to the dark hue of coffee, the very choicest that can 
be tasted being sometunes of quite a pale tint 

Always serve hot milk or cream, or hot milk and cold cream, if 
preferred, with breakfiist coffee. In the evening, when milk is served 
at all with it, it should likewise be boiling. 

Do not, m Agr way, make use of the residue of one day's coffee in 
preparing that of the next ; you would but injure the purity of its 
flavour by doing so, and effect next to noOing in the matter of 
economy.* 

EXCELLENT BREAKFAST COFFEE. 

A simple, well-made English filter, or percolater^ as it is ealkd, 
will answer perfectly for making coffee ; but firom amongst the iiiaii7 
of more recent invention which are on sale, the reader who prefen 
one of ornamental appearance, and of novel construction, will easily 
be suited. The size of the filter must be adapted to the nun^)er 
of persons for whom the coffee is to be prepared; for if a ha^ 
quantity of the powder be heaped into an insufilcient space for it, 
there will not be room for it to swell, and the water wul not pas 
through. Put three ounces of coffee into one which will contain in 
the lower compartment two pints and a half; shake the powder 
quite level and press it closely down ; remove the presser, put on the 
top strainer, and pour round and round, so as to wet the coffee 

• THiexi the coffee has been filtered in a proper maimer, water poured after 
wards on the "grounds" as they axe termed, will faara soarcelj anj taste or 
•oloor : this is not the ease when it has been boHed.

fiquallj, about the third part of a measnied pmt of fast boiling 
water.^ Let this drain quite through before more is added ; then 
pour in — still quite boiUng — in the same manner as much more 
water, and when it has passed through, add the remainder ; let it 
drain entirely through, then remove the top of the filter, put the 
cover on the part wlSch contains the coffee, and serve it immediately. 
It will be very strong, and perfectly clear. Fill the breakfast cupa 
two parts full of new boiling milk, and add as much of the infusion 
as wul give it the degree of strength which is agreeable to those for 
whom it is prepared. When it is liked extremely strong, the pro- 
portion of milk must be diminished, or less water be poured to the 
coffee. 

K nearly an additional half pint of water be added before the tor 
of the percolater is taken off, it will still be very good, provided that 
the coffee used be really of first-rate quality. * 

To make cheaper breakfast coffee to be served in the usual English 
mode, the same process should be followed, but the proportion of 
water must be considerably increased : it should always, however, be 
added by slow degrees. 

Good breakfast coffee (for three persons). Best Mocha, in mo- 
derately fine powder, ground at the instant of using it, 8 oz. ; boiling 
water added by decrees, 1 pint; (more at pleasure). Boiling milk 
served with it, 1^^ pint to 1 quart. Common English coffee : coffee- 
powder, 3 oz. ; water, 1 quart, to be slowly filtered; hot milk, half 
to whole pint Cream in addition to either of the above, at choice. 

TO BOIL COFFBB. 

To boil coffee and refine it, put the necessary quantity of water into 
a pot which it will not fill by some inches ; when it boils stir in the 
coffee ; for unless this be at once moistened, it will remain on the top 
and be liable to fly over. Give it one or two strong boils, then raise 
it from the fire, and simmer it for ten minutes only ; pour out a laive 
cupful twice, hold it high over the coffee pot and pour it in again, 
then set it on the stove where it will keep hot without simmering or 
moving in the least, for ten mmutes longer. It will be perfectly 
clear, unless mismanaged, without any other fining. Should more, 
however, be deemed necessary, a very small pinch of isinglass, or a 
clean egg-shell, with a little of the white adhering to it, is the best 
that can be used. Never use mustard to fine coffee with. It is a 
barbarous custom of which we have heard foreigners who have been 
in England vehemently complain. 

Coffee, 2 oz. ; water, 1 pint to 1 quart, according to the strength 
required. Boiled 10 minutes ; left to clear 10 minutes. 

BemarA.— Filtering is, we should say, a far more economical, and in 
every way a superior mode of making coffee to boiling it ; but as 
some persons stul prefer the old method, we insert the receipt for it

RBMARKS ON HOME-MADE BREAD. 

It 18 Borelj a nngralar fact that the one artide of our daily food on 
which health depends more than on any other, is predaely that 
which 18 obtained in England with the greatest difficolty— good^ 
lights and pure bread— j^i nothing can be more simple and easy than 
the process of making it, either in large quantities or in smalL 
From constaiit failure, it is nevertheless considered so difficult in 
many families, that recourse is had to the nearest baker, both in 
town and country, as a means of escape from the heavy, or bitter, or 
ill-baked masses of dough which appear at table under the name of 
household or Jtome-made bread; and which are well calculated to 
create the distaste which they often excite for eyerythin^ which 
bears its name. Without wishing in the slightest d^ee to disparage 
the skill and labour of bread-makers by trade, truth compels us to 
assert our conviction of the superior wholesomeness of bread made in 
our own homes. When a miller can be depended on to supply flour 
of good quality, and the other ingredients used in preparing it arc 
also fresh and good, and mingled with it in due prooortions, and the 
kneading, fermentation, and baking, are conducted with care and 



CHAP, jxll] bread. 595 

intelligenoe, the result inll xmiformly be excellent bread. Every 
oook, therefore,— and we might abnost say every female servant^ 
oiiffht to be pexfectly acquainted with the proper mode of making it ; 
ana skill in preparing a variety of dishes, is poor compensation for 
ignorance on this one essential point.* Moreover, it presents no more 
real difficulty than boUing a dish of potatoes, or making a rice 

Ceding ; and the n^lect with which it is treated is tiieraore the 
to be compzehended or excused. 

TO PUBIFT TBAST FOR BREAD OR CAKES. 

The veast procured fhmi a public brewery is often so extremely 
bitter that it can onl^ be renaered fit for use by frequent washings, 
and after these even it should be cautiously employed. Mix it, when 
first brought in, with a large quantity of add water, and set it by 
untU the following morning in a cool place ; then drain off the water, 
and stir the yeast up well with as much more of firesh : it must again 
stand several hours before the water can be poured dear frt>m it. 
By changing this daily in winter, and both night and morning in very 
hot weather, the yeast may be preserved fit for use much longer than 
it would otherwise be ; and should it ferment rather less fVeely after 
a time, a emaU portion of brown suffar and a littie warm milk or other 
liquid, stirred to it a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before it 
is required for bread-making, will restore its strength. 

The German yeast, of which we have spoken in detail in another 
part of this chaj^ter, makes exceedingly fight braid and buns, a^ is 
never bitter ; it is therefore a valuable sulwtitute for our own beer- 
yeast, but cannot be procured in all parts of the country, for tiie 
reasons which we have stated. 

THE OVEN. 

A brick oven, heated with wood, is fiir superior to any other for 
baking bread, as well as for most other purposes. The iron ovens, 
now commonly attached to kitchen-ranges — the construction of whidi 
has within these few years been wonderfullv improved — ^though ex- 
ceedingly convenient, from the fiunlity which they afford for baking 
at all hours of the day, do not in general answer well for hreadj unless 
it be made into very small loaves or rolls, as the surface becomes 
hardened and browned long before the heat has sufficientiy penetrated 

• Only those persons wbo lire habitaally on good home-made bread, can foorm 
an idea of the extent to which health is affected by their being deprived of it 
We have been appealed to on seTeral occasions for household loares-^which we 
hare sent to a considerable distance — ^by Mends who complained of being ren- 
dered really ill by the bread which they were compelled to eat in the aea«ida 
towns and in other places of fashionable resort ; and in London we hare heard 
incessant complaints both from foreigners and habitual residsnti, of the im- 
pouibility of obtainisg rtdUif whoktomt Intad,

to the centre of the don^h. The nme objeetion often exists to izon- 
oyens of Ureer sixe, which require care and management, to ensore 
the sncoessfm nse of them. A orick oven should be well heated with 
faggot wood, or with a faggot, and two or three solid logs ; and after 
it IS deared, the door should be closely shut for quite half an hour 
before the baking commences: the heat will then be well sustained 
for a succession of bread, pies, cakes, and small pastry. The servant 
who habitually attends at an oven will soon beoome acquainted with 
the precise quantity of the! which it requires, and all other pecn- 
litfities which may be connected with it. 

A FEW RULES TO BE OBSBBVED IK MAB3Na BBBAD. 

Never use too large a proportion of yeast, as the bread will not 
only become dry very speedily when this is done, but it will be fiur 
less sweet and pleasant in flavour than that which is more slowly 
fermented, and the colour will not be so good : there will also be a 
great chance of its being bitter when brewer*s yeast is used for it 

Remember that milk or water of scalding heat poured to any kind 
of yeast will render the bread heavy. One pint of either added quite 
boiling to a pint and a half of cold, will bring it to about the degree 
of warmdi required. In firosty weather the proportion of the baited 
lionid may be increased a little. 

When only porter-yeast — ^which is dark-coloured and bitter— can 
be procured, use a much smaller proportion than usual, and allow 
mMch longer time for it to rise. T^ever let it be sent to the oven 
until it 18 evidentiy Ught. Bitter bread is unpalatable, but not 
really unwholesome ; but heavy bread is partieularly so. 

Let the leaven be kneaded up quickly with the remainder of the 
flour when once it is well risen, as it should on no account be 
allowed to sink again before this is done, when it has reached the 
proper point ; and in makinK the dough, be particularly careM not 
to render it too lithe by adcung more liquid than is requisite. It 
should be quite firm, and entirely free from lumps and crumbs 
throughout the mass, and on the surface also, which ought to be 
perfectly smooth. 

In winter, place the bread while it is rising sufficiently dose to the 
fire to prevent its becoming cold, but never so near as to render it 
hot. A warm thick doth should be thrown over the pan in whidi it 
is made immediatelv after the leaven is mixed, and kept on it until 
the bread is ready for the oven. 



HOUSEHOLD BREAD. 

Put half a bnshd (more or less, according to the consumption of the 
family) of flour into the kneading tub or trough, and hollow it wdl in 
the imddle; dilute a pint of yeast as it is brought from the breweij^ 



CHAP. XXXI.] BBEAB. 697 

cxr half the quantity if it has heen washed and rendered solid, with 
four quarts or more of lukewarm milk or water, or a mixture of the 
two ; stir into it, from the surrounding part, with a wooden spoon, 
as much flour as will make a thick batter; throw a handful or . 
two over it, and leave this, which is called the leaven, to rise before 
proceeding further. In about an hour it mil have swollen con- 
siderably, and have burst through the coating of flour on the top ; 
then pour in as much more warm liquid as "mil convert the whole, 
-mihgood kneading^ and this should not be spared, into a firm dough, 
of which the surface shotdd be entirely free from lumps or crumbs. 
Throw a cloth over, and let it remain until it has risen very much a 
second time, which will be in an hour, or something; more, if the 
bfl^bch be large. Then work it lightly up, and mould it into loaves 
of from two to three pounds weight ; send them directly to a well 
heated oven, and bake them from an hour and a half to an hour and 
three-quarters. 

Flour, I bushel ; salt (when it is liked), 4 to 6 oz. ; yeast, 1 pint 
unwashed, or \ pint if puiifled ; milk, or water, 2 quarts : 1 to 1} 
hour. Additional liquid as needed. 

Obs, — ^Brown bread can be made exactly as above, either with half 
meal and half flour mixed, or with meal only. This will absorb 
more moisture than fine flour, and will retain it rather longer. 
Brown bread should always be thoroughly baked, 

Remarh. — We have seen it very erroneously asserted in one or

l^fix with a gallon of flour a large teaspoonfhl of flne salt, make a 
hoUow in the centre, and pour in two tablespoonsful of solid, well pu- 
rified yeast, f^raduallv diluted with about two pints and ahalf of milk, 
and work it into a tnick batter with the surrounding flour, strew a 
thick layer over and leave it to rise from an hour to an hour and a 
half; then knead it up with as much more warm skimmed milk, or 
half new milk and half water, as will render it quite firm and smooth 
without being very stiff; let it rise another hour, and divide it into 
three loaves; put them into square tins slightly buttered, or into 
round baking pans, and bake them about an hour and a ouarter in a 
well-heated oven. The dough can be formed into housenold loaves 
if preferred, and sent to the oven in the usual way. When a finer

GERMAN YEAST. 

(And Bread made toUh Oerman TeaeL) 

This has very generally superseded the use of English beer-veast 
in London, and other places conveniently situated for receiving 
quickly and r^pilarly the supplies of it which are imported from 
abroad ; but as it speedily becomes putrid in sultry weather, md does 
not in any season remain good long after its arrival here, it is un- 
suited for transmission to remote {nrts of the country. Bread made 
with it while it is perfectly sweet, is extremely light and good, and it 
answers remarkably well for light cakes and biscuits. An ounce n 
tiie proportion which we have always had used for a quartern (half 
a gallon or three pounds and a half) of flour, and this, with the ad- 
dition of some salt and nearly a quart of milk, or milk and water, has 
produced excettent bread when it has been made with care. Tbe 
yeast should be verjr gradually and perfectly moistened and blended 
with the warm liqmd ; for umess this be done, and the whole ren- 
dered smooth as cream, the dough will not be of the unifonn texture 
which it ought, but will be fuU of laige hollow spaces, whidi are 
never seen in well-made bread The mass should be mixed up finnly 
and weU kneaded 9i once, then left to rise for about an hour ; aflsin 
kneaded thoroughly, and a^;ain left to rise from three-quarters <?an

PROFESSOR ZiIEBIo's BAYABXAN BROWN BREAD, 

(Very nutritious and whoUtoma^ 

Baron Liebig pronounces this bread to be very superior to that 
which is nude with fine floor soleljr, both in consequence of the 
greater amount of nutriment which it contains, and from its slight 
medicinal effect, which renders it valuable to many persons accu8« 
tomed to have frequent recourse to drugs, of which it supersedes the 
necessity. It is made with the wheat exactly as it is ground, no part 
being subtracted, nor any additional flour mingled wiu it. He directs 
that the wheat should not be damped before it is prepared; but few 
millers can be found who will depart from their ordinary practice to 
oblige private customers ; and this determined adherence to established 
usage intervenes constantly between us, and all improvement in our 
modes of preparing food. The bread is made in the usual way, with 
water only, or with a portion of milk added to the yeast, as taste or 
convenience may dictate. The loaves should be well baked at all 
times ; and the dough should of course be perfectly light when it is 
placed in the oven. Salt should be mixed vdth the meal before the 
yeast is added. 

ENGLISH BROWN BREAD. 

This is oiten made with a portion only of the unbolted meal re- 
commended in the preceding receipt, mixed with more or less of fine 
flour, according to the quality of bread reauired ; and in many fami- 
lies the coarse oran is always sifted fh>m the meal, as an impression 
exists that it is irritating to the stomach. If one gallon of meal as it 
comes from the mill, be well mixed with an equal measure of flour, 
and made into a doueh in the manner directed for white household 
bread, the loaves will still be sufficiently brown for the general taste 
in this country, and they will be good and wholesome, though not, 
perhaps, so entirely easy of digestion as Baron Liebig*8 Bavarian 

UNFERMENTED BREAD. 

This bread, in which carbonate of soda and muriatie acid are sub- 
stituted for yeast or other leaven, has within these few years been 
highly recommended, and much eaten. It may possibly suit many 
persons better than that which is fermented in the usual way, but it 
IS not in general by aiw means so pleasant in flavour ; and there is 
much more chance of failure in preparing it in private families, as it 
requires some skill to mix the ingprements with exactness and despatch; 
and it is absolutely necessary tluit the doueh should be set into the 
oven the instant it is ready. In some hy<&opathic and other large

establishmentSi where it is always rapplied to the table in liea of the 
more common kinds, it is, we nave been informed by patients who 
had partaken cf it there for many months together, exceedingly and 
uniformly good« More detailed mformation with regard to it, will 
be found in our ** Cookeir for Invalids,** a work for which our want 
of apace in the present volume compels us to reserve it. 

** For each pound of flour (or meal) take forty grains of sesoui- 
carbonate of soda, mix it intimately with the sugar and flour, tnen 
add ^y drops of muriatic add of the shops, diluted with half a pint 
of water, or with as much as may be requisite to form the dough, 
stirring it constantly into a smooth mass. Divide it into a couple of 
loaves, and put them immediately into a quick oven.** Bake them 
thoroughly. 

Author*s note.— Dr. Pereira, from whose book on diet the sub- 
stance of the above receipt is taken, says that delicious bread was 
made by it in his presence by the cook of Mr. John Savoiy, of 
Bond Street, equal to any bread fermented by the usual process. 
We would suggest that the soda, mixed with the sugar, and a small 
portion of the flour, should be rubbed through a hair sieve with a 
wooden spoon into the remainder of the flour, and stirred up with it 
until the whole is perfectly mingled, before the liquid is added. 
Should lighter bread be desired, the soda may be increased to fifty or 
even sixty grains, if the quantity of add be proportionately aug- 
mented. As common salt is formed by the combination of these two 
agents, none beside is needed in the bread. 

Flour, 1 lb.; sesquicarbonate of soda, 40 grains; sugar, 1 tea- 
spoonfhl; muriatic add of the shops, ^0 drops; water, i pint (or as 
needed). 

POTATO BREAD. 

One pound of good mealy potatoes, steamed or boiled very dry, in 
the ordmary way, or prepared by Captain Kater*s recdpt (see Chapter 
XYIL), and rubbed ^mte hot, through a coarse sieve, into a cou^de 
of pounds of flour, with which ihey should be well mixed, will pro- 
duce exceUent broid, which will remain moist much longer than 
wheaten bread made as usuaL The yeast should be add^ imme- 
diately after the potatoes. An ounce or two of butter, an ^g and 
some new milk, 'mil convert this bread into superior rolls. 

DINZTBR OR BREAKFAST BOLLS. 

Crumble down very small indeed, an ounce of butter into a ooupk 
of pounds of the best flour, and mix with them a large saltspoonml 
of salt. Put into a basin a dessertspoonful of solid, well-purified 
yeast, and half a teas^nfUl of pounded sugar ; mix these with half 
a pint of warm new nulk ; hollow the centre of the flour, pour in the 
yeast gradually, stirring to it sufficient of the surrounding flour to 
mako a thick batter; strew more flour on the top, cover a thick

double doth over the pan, and let it stand in a warm kitchen to 
rise. In winter it must be placed within a few feet of the fire. In 
about an hour, should the leaven have broken through the flour on 
the top, and have risen considerably in height, mix one lightly- 
whisked egg, or the volks of two, with nearly half a pint more of 
Suite warm new miilk, and wet up the mass into a very smooth 
ough. Cover it as before, and in from half to three-quarters of an 
hour turn it on to a paste-board, and divide it into twenty-four 
portions of equal size. Ejiead these up as lightly as possible into 
small round, or olive-shaped roUs; make a slight incision round 
them, and cut them once or twice across the top, placing them as 
they are done on slightlv floured baking sheets an inch or two apart 
Let them remain for fifteen or twenty minutes to prove; then wash 
the tops with ^olk of eg^, mixed with a little milk, and bake them 
in a rather brisk oven mm ten to fifteen minutes. Turn them 
upside down upon a dish to cool after' they are taken from the tins. 
An additional ounce of butter and another egg can be used for these 
rolls when richer bread is liked ; but it is so much less wholesome 
than a more simple kind, that it is not to be recommended. A cup 
of good cream would be an admirable substitute for butter altogether, 
rendering the rolls exceedingly delicate both in appearance and in 
flavour. The veast used for them should be stirred up with plenty 
of cold water the daj^* before it is wanted ; and it will be found very 
thick indeed when it is poured off, which should be gentlv done. 
Bather less than an ounce of good fresh German yeast may be used 
for them iostead of brewer's yeast, witb advantage 

GENEVA ROLLS^ OR BUNS. 

Break down into very small crumbs three ounces of butter with two 
pounds of flour ; add a little salt, and set the sponge with a large 
tablespoonful of solid yeast, mixed with a pint of new milk, and a 
tablespoonful or more of strong saflron water; let it rise for a fVill 
hour, then stir to a couple of well-beaten effgs as much hot milk as 
will render them lukewarm, and wet the ToSa with them to a light, 
lithe dou^h ; leave it from half to three-ouarters of an hour longer, 
mould it mto small rolls, brush them witn beatenvolk of egg, and 
bake them from twenty minutes to half an hour. The addition of six 
ounces of good susar, three of butter, half a pound or more of currants, 
the grated rind of a large lemon, and a couple of ounces of candied 
orange-rind, will convert these into excellent buns. When the 
flavour of the saffron is not liked, omit it alto^ther. Only so 
much should be used at any time as will give a ndi colour to the 
bread

RUBKS. 

Work quite into cmmbs six ounces of butter with a couple of

tablespoonsful of mild beer yeast, three well-beaten eggs, and nearly 
half a pint of warm new milk. When it has risen to its full heiffht 
knead it smooth, and make it into very small loaves or thick cakes 
cut with a round cake-cutter; place them on a floured tin, and let 
them stand in a warm place to prove from ten to twenty minutes 
before the^ are set into tne oven. Bake them about a quarter of an 
hour ; divide them while they are still warm, and put them into a 
very slow oven to dry. When they are crisp quite tnrough they are 
done. Four teaspoonsM of sifted sugar must oe added when sweet- 
rusks are preferred.

For either of the preceding receipts substitute rather more than an 
ounce of German yeast, when it can be procored quite fresh; or 
should an ounce of it only be used (whicn we should consider an 
ample proportion), let the dou^h— especially that of the rusks — 
become extremely light before it is kneaded down, and also pre- 
viously to its beinff sent to the oven. A somewhat smaller quanti^ 
of yeast is required in warm weather than in cold.

EXCELLENT DAIRY-BREAD MADE WITHOUT YEAST. 

{AyJthof'9 BeeeiptJ) 

When we first heard unfermented bread vaguely spoken of, we 
had it tried very successfully in the following manner ; and we have 
since been told that an aknost similar method of preparing it ii 
common in many remote parts both of England and JxeUmd, where 
it is almost impossible to procure a constant supply of yeast. Blend 
well together a teaspoonful of pounded sugar and fifty erains of the 
purest carbonate of soda ; mix a saltspoonful of salt wi& a ^und of 
flour, and rub the soda and sugar through a hair-sieve into it Stir 
and miQgle them well, and make them quickly into a firm but not 
hard dough with sour buttermilk. Bake tne lou well in a thoroughly 
heated, but not jperce oven. In a brick, or good iron oven a few 
minutes less than an hour would be sufficient to bake a loaf of 
flimihir weight The buttermilk should be kept untfl it is quite add, 



CHAP, zzzi.] BSEAD. 608 

but it must never be ia the alkbtest degree randd, or otherwise bad 
AU unfermented bread should be placed in the oven directly it is 
made, or it will be heayy. For a larger baking allow rather less 
than an ounce of soda to the gallon (seven pound^ of flour. 

Obs, — ^There are cases in which a knowledge of this, or of any 
other equallyeasy mode of bread-making wouM be invaluable. For 
example :— We learn from the wife of an officer who has for a long 
time been stationed off the Isle of Skye, in which his family have 
their abode, that the inhabitants depend entirely for bread on sup- 
plies brought to them from Glasgow ; and that they are often entirely 
without, when the steamer which ou^ht to arrive at intervals of 
eight days, is delayed by stress of weauier. The residents are then 
compelled to have recourse to scones-^ta a mixture of flour and water 
and a little soda (cooked on a flat iron ^late), are called— or to ship's 
biscuit; and these are often found unsuitable for young children and 
invalids. There are no ovens in the houses, though there are grates 
for coal fires, in front of which small loaves of unfermented bread 
could be baked extremely well in good American ovens. Buttermilk 
can always be procured ; and if not, a provision of carbonate of soda 
and muriatic add might be kept at hand to ensure the means of 
making wholesome bread. In many other localities the same plan 
might prove of equal benefit. 

TO KEEP BREAD. 

Bread requires almost as much care as milk to preserve it whole- 
some and fresh. It should be laid, as soon as it is perfectly cold, 
into a large earthen pan with a cover, which should be kept free 
from crumbs, and be firequently scalded, and then wiped very dry for 
use. Loaves which have been cut should have a smaller pan appro- 
priated to them, and this also should have the loose crumbs wiped 
from it daily. It is a good plan to raise the bread-pans frt>m the 
floor of the larder, when there is no proper stand or frame for the 
purpose, by means of two flat wedges of wood, so as to allow a 
current of air to pass under thenu 

TO FRESHEN STALE BREAD (aND PASTRY^ ETC.), AND PRESERTB 
rr FROM MOULD. 

If entire loaves be placed in a gentle oven and heated quite 
through, toiikout being previously dipped into cold water, according 
to the old-fashioned plan, they will eat almost like bread newly 
baked: they should not remain in it long enough to become hard 
and dry, but they should be made hot tmt>ughout. In ver^ damp 
localities, when large household bakings take place but once m eight 
or ten days, it is sometimes necessary to use precautions ap;ainst the 
attack of mould, though the bread may have been exceedii^ly well 
made; and the meth& recommended above will be the bc»t for 



604 MODEBK COOKEBT. [cur. zzzl 

wazding it off, and for preserviiu; the bread eatable for sereral days 
longer than it would otherwise be. If large loaves be just dipped 
into cold water and then placed in a quick oven until they are again 
thoroughly dried, they wul resemble neto bread altogether. 

Pastry, cakes, and biscuits, may all be greatly improved when 
ftale, by heating them in a gentle oven. 

TO KNOW WHEN BREAD IS SUFFICIENTLY BAKED. 

When the suillue is uniformly browned, and it is everywhere firm 
to ike Umchy and the bottom crust of a loaf is hard, it is generally 
certain that it is thoroughly baked. To test bread that has been cut 
(or yeast-cakes^, press down the crumb lightly in the centre with the 
thumb ; when it is elastic and rises again to its place, it is proof that 
it is perfectly done ; but if the indentation rexnains, the heat has not 
sufficiently penetrated the dough to convert it into wholesome eating 

ON THB PBOPBB FERMENTATION OF DOUGH. 

As we have previouslv said, too large a nroi^ortion of yeast, which 
is very commonly used by persons not well skilled in bread-making 
although it produces quickly a light spongy dough, has a very bad 
effect on bread, which it renders much less easy of digestion than 
that which is more slowly fermented, and far less sweet and pleasant 
in flavour : it also prevents its remaining eatable the same length of 
time, as it speedily oecomes dry. It is likewise v^ disadvantageous 
to nuike the dough so lithe that it spreads about in the oven ; and if 
.it be exceuively stiff, and its management not thoroughly understood, 
it will sometimes be heavy, To prevent this, it should be kept quite 
warm (never Aso(»d), and left a much longer time to riae. It wUl 
frequently then prove ezceUent It will ferment rather more quiddy 
if, when it gives symptoms of becoming light it is made up into 
loaves with me least possible kneadins, and a slight incision is made 
round them and across the tops, and tney are then placed in a warm 
air, and kept secure from cold currents passing over them.

RmfABKB ON JEWISH OOOKEBT. 

From beinff forbidden by their usages to mingle butter, or other 
preparation of milk or cream with meat at any meal, the Jews have 
oil much used in their cookery of fish, meat, and yegetables. 
Founded almonds and rich syrups of sugar and water agreeably 
fiavoured, assist in compounding their sweet dishes, many of whicn 
are excellent, and preserve much of their oriental character ; but we 
are credibly informed that the restrictions of which we have spoken 
are not at the present day very rigidly obeerved by the main body of 
Jews in this country, though they are so by those who are denuni- 
natedstrict 

JEWISH SMOKED BEEF.* 

This is exceVmd^ possessing the fine flavour of a really well cnied 
ham, and retaining it unimnaared for a very lone time after it is cut 
or cooked, if kept in a cool larder ; it is therefore a valuable and 
inexpensive store fbr imparting savour to soups, gravies, and other 
preparations; and it affords a£o a dish of high relish for the tU>le 
An inch or two of the lean part, quite cleared firom the smoked edges 
and divided into dice, will flavour toell a tureen of gravy, or a pint of 
soup : even that which has been boiled will greatly improve the 
flavour of Liebig*s extract of beef, and of any simple brom or com- 
sommL From Sie de|>th of fat upon it, whidi appears particularly 
rich and mellow, we think it is the thick flank of^the beef of whi^ 
we have made trial in various ways, and which is now in much 
request in several families of our acquaintance, who find it greatly 
superior to the common hung or Dutch beef, to which they were 
previously accustomed. 

It must be cooked in the same manner as other smoked meats, 
more time being allowed for it than for fresh. Drop it into boilmg 
water, and when it has boiled quickly for ten minutes, take off the 
scum ^ould any appear, add cold water sufficient to reduce it to

who afterwards supplied us with the address of the butcher from whom it was 
procured : Mr» Pau, 84, Duke Strtetf AldgaU^ from whom the ehariua also may be 

Jurohased, and probably many other varieties of smoked meat which are used in 
ewish cookery. For such of our readers as may not be acquainted with the fact. 
It may be well to state here that all meat supplied by Jew butchezs is sure to be 
of first-rate quality, as they are forbidden by Uie Mosaic Law to oonTeit into toTA 
any animal which is not perfectly free from all " spot or blemislu"

mere scalding heatj bring it again sently to a boil, and simmer it until 
the lean appears quite ten£r wnen probed with a sharp skewer; 
then lift it on to a drainer and serre it hot or cold, and ganuBhed in 
either case with vegetables or otherwise at pleasure. 
Beef^ 6 lbs. : 3 hours or more. 

cHORissA (or sjswisa sausage) witr bice. 

The choriasa is a peculiar kind of smoked sausage much served at 
Jewish tables* as an accompaniment to boiled poultry, &c. It 
seems to be in great part composed of delicate pounded meat, inter* 
mingled with suet and with a small portion of some highly-cured 
preparation, and with herbs or spices which impart to it an agreeable 
aromatic flavour. 

Drop the chorissa into warm water, heat it gently, boil it for about 
twenty minutes, and serve it surrounded with rice prepared as for 
currie. It will be found very sood broiled in slices after the previous 
boiliQ^ : it should be cold before it is again laid to the fire. In all 
cases it will, we thmk, be found both more easy of digestion and 
more agreeable if half-boiled at least before it is broiled, toasted, or 
warmed in the oven for table. It is a 0X)d addition to forcemeat^ 
and pounded savoury preparations, if used in moderation. 

TO FRY SALMON AND OTHER FISH IN OIL. 

(To Serve Cold.) 

Turn into a snuiU deep ii^g-pan, which should be kept for the 
purpose, a flask of fresh ohve oil, place it over a dear fire, and as 
soon as it ceases to bubble lay in a pound and a half of delicate 
salmon properly cleansed and well dried in a cloth, and fry it ^ntly 
until it is cooked quite through. The surface should be only lightly 
browned, and when the proper colour is attaiued the pan must be 
lifted so high from the fire as to prevent it being deepened, as we 
have directed in Chapter IX. in the general instructions for fiyinf. 
Drain the fish well when it is done, and when it is perfectly cola, 
dish, and garnish it with light foli^. The Jews have cold fried 
fish much served at their rejMists. Fmets of soles, plaice, brill, small 
turbots, or other flat fish, may be fried as above, and arranged in a 
symmetrical form round a i>ortion of a larger fish, or bv themselves. 
We would recommend as an accompaniment one of the Mauritian 
ckatniee which are to be found in this chapter. ' 

Olive oil, 1 small flask ; salmon, about 1^ lb. : \ hour or rather 
more. Fillets offish 5 to 10 minutes. 

Obe, — The oil should be strained through a sieve, and set aside as 
the fish is done ; it will serve many times for frying if this be ob- 
served. 

* It may be had at the same shops as the smoked beef, and is the same prioe—

JEWISH ALMOND PUDDmO. 

We have not thought it necessaiy to test this receipt onrsdveBy ai 
we hare tasted the paddings made by it more than onoe, and hare 
received the exact directions for them from the Jewish lady at whose 
house they were made. They are extremely delicate and excellent. 
The almonds for them were procured ready ground from a Jew con- 
fectioner, but when they cannot be thus obtained they must be 
pounded in the usual manner. With half a ]pound of swee^ mingle 
six or seven bitter almonds, half a pound of sifted sugar, a little &ie 
orange-flower water, with the yolks of ten and the whites of seven 
well whisked eggs, and when the whole of the ingredients are 
intimately blended, bake the pudding in a rather quick oven for 
half an hour, or lon^r should it not he then suffidenUy firm to turn 
out of the dish. Sift sugar thickly over, or pour round it a rich 
syrup flavoured with orange-flower water, noyau or maraschino. 

Obt. — We think a fruit syrup— pine-apple or other— or a compote 
of fruit would be an excellent accompaniment to this pudding, which 
may be served hot or cold. We conclude that the disn in which it is 
baked, \f not well buttered^ must be rubbed with oil. The above pro- 
portions will make two puddings of suflident size for a small part^. 

THB lady's or nnrALID's NBW BAKED APPLE PUDDIXO. 

(Author*s Original Reeeipi, Appropriate to the Jewish table.} 

This pudding, which contains no butter, is most excellent when 
made toUh exactness bv the directions whidi follow, but any variation 
firom them will probably be attended with entire fkilure, especially in 
the crust, which if properly made will be solid, but ver^ light and 
crisp ; whereas, if the proportion of sugar for it be diminished, the 
bread will not form a compact mass, but will fall into crumbs when 
it is served. First weigh six ounces of the crumb of a light stale 
loaf, and grate it down small ; then add to, and mix thoroughly with 
it three ounces and a half of pounded sugar, and a slight pinch of 
salt. Next, take fh>m a pouna to a pound and a quarter of russets, 
or of any other good baking apples ; pare, and then take them off the 
cores in quarters without cutting the fruit asunder, as they will then, 
from the form given to them, lie more compactly in the dish. 
Arrange them in close layers in a deep tart-dish which holds 
about a pint and a hali^ and strew amon^ them four ounces of 
sugar and the grated rind of a fine fresh lemon ; add the strained 
juice of the lemon, and pour the bread-crumbs softly in a heap upon 
the apples in the centre of the dish, and with the back of a spoon

covered with them. Sift powdered sugar over, wipe the edge of tM

dish, and bake the pudding in a somewhat quick oven for rather more 
than three-quarters of an nour. We have nad it several times baked 
quite successfully in a baker*s oven, of which the heat is in general 
too great for puddings of a delicate kind. Very pale brown sugar 
will answer for it almost as well as pounded. For the nursery, some 
crumbs of bread may be strewed between the layers of fruit, and 
nutmeg or cinnamon may be used instead of lemon. 

Obs. — We insert this receipt here because the pudding has been so 
much liked, and found so wholesome by many persons who have 
partaken of it at different times, that we think it will be acceptable to 
some of our readers, but it belongs properly to another work which 
we have in progress, and from which we extract it now for the 
present volume. An ounce or more of ratifias crushed to powder, 
may be added to the crust, or strewed over the pudding before it is 
served, when they are considered an improvement. 

A FEW GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE JEWISH TABLE. 

As a substitute for milk, in the composition of souffles^ puddings, 
and sweet dishes, almond-^eam as it is caiiecl, will be lound to answer 
excellently. To prepare it, blanch and jxjund the almonds by the 
directions of pa<re 542, and then pour very gradually to them boiling 
water in the proportion directed below; turn them into a strong 
cloth or tammy, and wring it from them with powerful pressure, to 
extract as much as possible of it from them again. 

The fruit custards of page 482, and the meringues of fruit of page 
485, are perfectly suited to the tables of Jewish families ; and sweet 
or savoury croustades or fried patties may be supplied to them from 
the receipts in the present work, by substituting clarified marrow 
^ee page 388) for the butter usea for them in general cookery. 
The reader will easily discover in addition, numerous dishes dis* 
tributed through this volume which may be served to them without 
departing from their peculiar usages. 

Almond-cream : (for puddings, &c.) almonds, 4 oz. ; water, 1 pint. 
For blancmanges, and nch souffles^ creams and custards : almonds, ^ 
to whole pound ; water, 1 to IJ pints. 

Obs. — As every cook may not be quite aware of the articles of food 
strictly prohibited by the Mosaic law, it may be well to specify thum 
here, rork in every form ; all varieties of shell-fish, without ex- 
ception ; hares, rabbits, and swans.

nine piquant or stimiilating auxiliaries are intermingled with all of 
them in greater or less proportion. These are, young oniony 
ehilies (sometimes green ffm^er), oil, vinegar, and ttlt; and occa* 
fllonally a little garlic or follgrown onion, which in England might 
he superseded hv a small portion of minced eschalot. Green peaches, 
mangoes, and other unripe fruits, crushed to pulp on the stone roller, 
shown at the head of this chapter; ripe hauanas, tomatas roasted or 
raw, and also reduced to a smooth pulp; potatoes cooked and 
mashed; the fruit of the ^g-plant hoiledand reduced to a paste; 
fish, fresh, salted, or smokd, and boiled or grilled, taken in small 
fragments from the hones and skin, and torn into minute shreds, or 
pounded, are all in their turn used in their preparation.* Mn^le 
with any one of these as much of the green onions and chilies 
chopped up small, as will give it a strong flaTOur ; add salt if needed, 
and as much olive oil, of pure quality, with a third as much of 
vinegar, as will bring it to tne consistence of a thick sauce. Serve 
it with currie, cutleto, steaks, pork, cold meat, or fish, or aught elae 
to which it would be an acceptable accompaniment. 



INDIAN LOBSTEB-CUTLBTS. 

A really excellent and elegant receipt for lobster-cutlets has 
already been given in previous editions of the present work, and is 
now to be found at page 91 of Chapter IIL ; but the subjoined is one 
which may be more readily and en)editiou8ly prepared, and may 
consequently, be preferred by some of our readers for'that reason: it 
has also the recommendation of being[ new. In India, these cutlets 
are made from the flesh of prawns, 'vniich are there of enormous sixe, 
but lobsters, unless quite overgrown, answer for them as weU, or 
better. Select fish of good size and take out the tails entire ; .slice 
them about the third of an inch thick, dip them into beaten ^g, and 
then into very fine crumbs of bread seasoned rather high^ with 
cayenne, and moderately with salt, grated nutmeg, and pounded 
mace. Egg and crumb them twice, press the bread upon them with 
the blade of a knife, and when all are reidy, fry them quickly in 
good butter to a light brown. Serve them as dry as possible, 
arranged in a chain round a hot dish, and pour into the centre, or 
send to table with them in a tureen, some sauce made with the flesh 
of the claws heated in some rich melted butter, flavoured with a 
tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, one of strong chili vin^^, a 
little salt and mace, and coloured with the coral of the fish, should 
they contain any. A few shrimps may be added with good effect; 
or the sauce may be made of these entirely, either whole or pounded, 
when they are preferred. In either case, they should only be heated

wise be dipned into light French batter, and fHed ; but the egg and

lobsters little more than parboiled for them. Herbs can be added 
to the crumbs at pleasure; the writer does not, however, recom-

iEnirie.) 

This is an Oriental dish of high sayour, which may be made 
either with a youiu^ fowl or chicken parboiled for the purpose, or 
with the remains of such as have already been sent to table. First, 
put into a stowpan about a tablespoonful of very mild onion finely 
minced, or a larger proportion with a mixture of eschalots, for 
persons whose taste is in favour of so strong a flavour; add rather 
more than a Quarter of a pint of cold water, about an ounce of 
butter smoothly blended with a very small teaspoonful of flour, 
a moderate seasoning of cayenne, and a tablespoonful of essence of 
anchovies. Shake or stir this sauce over a clear fire until it boils, 
then let it stand aside and merely simmer for ten or fifteen minutes, 
or until the onion is ^uite tender, then pour to it a couple of 
wineglassesM of Madeira (Sherry or Teneriffe will do), and a 
tablespoonful of chili-vinegar. Lay in the fowl after having carved 
it nearly, divided all the joints, and stripped off the skm; and 
let it remain close to the fire, but without boiling, until it is per- 
fectly heated through ; bring it to the point of boiling and send it 
immediately to table. A dish of rice, boiled as for currie, is often, 
but not invariably, served with it. Should the fowl have been par- 
boiled only — that is to say, boiled for a quarter of an hour — ^it must 
be gently stewed iu the sauce for fifteen or twenty minutes ; longer, 
even, should it not then be quite tender. Cold lamb, or veal, or 
calTs-head, or a delicate young rabbit, may be very advantageously 
served as a rechauffe^ in a sauce compounded as above. The various 
condiments contained in this can be differently apportioned at pleasure; 
and pickled capsicum, or chilies minced, can be added to it at choice 
either in lieu of^ or in addition to the chili-vine^r. The juice of a 
iresh lime should, if possible, be thrown into it before it is served. 
Except for a quite pudn family dinner, only the superior joints of 
poultry should be used for this dish. Care should be taken not to 
allow the essence of anchovies to predominate too powerfully in it

still be much diminished with advantage :-^** Five eggs, two tolahs of

KBDOERBB OR KIDGEllRE^ AN INDIAN BREAKFAST DISH. 

Boil four ounces of rice tender and dry as for currie, and when it is 
cooled down put it into a 8auce})an with nearly an equal quantity of 
cold fish taken clear of skin and bone, and divided into very small 
flakes or scallops. Cut up an ounce or two of fresh butter and add it, 
with a full seasoning of cayenne, and as much salt as may be required. 
Stir the kedgeree constantly over a clear fire until it is very hot ; 
then mingle quickly with it two slightly beaten eggs. Do not let it 
boil after these are stirred in ; but serve the dish when they are just 
set A Mauritian chatney may be sent to table with it. The butter 
may be omitted, and its place supplied by an additional egg or more. 

Cold turbot, brill, salmon, soles, John Dory, and shrimps, may all 
be served in this form. 

A SIMPLE SYRIAN PILAW. 

Drop gradually into three pints of boiling water one pint of rice 
which nas been shaken in a cullender to free it from the dust aud 
tlien well wiped in a soft clean cloth. The boiling should not he 
checked by the addition of the rice, which if well managed will re- 
quire no stirring, and which will entirely absorb the water. It 
snould be placed above the fire where the heat will reach it equally 
from below ; and it should boil gently that the grain may become 
quite tender and dry. When it is so, and the surface is full of holes, 
pour in two or three ounces of clarified butter, or merely add some, 
cut up small ; throw in a seasoning of salt and white pepper, or cay- 
enne ; stir the whole up well, and serve it immediately. An onion, 
when the flavour is liked, may be boiled in the water, which should 
aiUrwards be strained, before the rice is added; there should be 
three pints of it v^hen the grain is dropped in. 



CHAP, xxxn.] FOBEIGN COOKERY. 613 

Small fried flauaus^ or sausage-cakes may be serred with it at 
pleasure for English eaters. The rice may be well washed and 
thoroughly dried in a cloth when time will permit. 

SIMPLB TURKISH OR ARABIAN PILAW. 

(From Mr. Lane^ the Oriental Traveller.) 

" PiUoD or pildn is made by boiling rice in plenty of water for 
about twenty minutes, so that the water drains off ea^y, leaving the 
grains whole, and with some degree of hardness ; then stirring it up 
with a little butter, just enough to make the grains separate easily, 
and seasoning it with salt and pepper. Often a fowl, boiled almost 
to rags, is laid upon the top. Sometimes small morsels of fried or 
roasted mutton or lamb are mixed up with it ; and there are many 
other additions ; but generally the Turks and Arabs add nothing to 
the rice but the butter, and salt, and pepper." 

Obs, — We are indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Lane for this receipt, 
which was procured from him for us by one of his friends. 



A REAL INDIAN PILAW. 

Boil three pounds of bacon in the usual maimer; take it out and 
drop into the same pan a pair of fowls compactly trussed as for 
boiling. In three quarters of an hour, unless very large, they will 
be sufficiently cooked ; but they should be thoroughly boiled. When 
they are so, lift Ihem out, and place a hot cover and thick cloth over 
them. Take three pints and a half of the liquor in which they were 
boiled, and add to it when it again boils, nearly two pounds of well 
washed Patna rice, three onions, a quarter of an ounce each of cloves 
and pepper-corns, with half as much of allspice, tied loosely in a bit 
of muslin. Stew these together very gently for three quarters of an 
hour. Do not stir them as it breaks the rice. Take out the spice and 
onions; lay in the fowls if necessary, to heat them ouite through, 
and dish them neatly with the rice heaped smoothly over them. 
Garnish the pilaw with hot hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters, or with 
fried forcemeat-balls, or with half rings of onion fried extremely dry. 
The bacon, heated apart, should be served in a separate dish. 

Obs. — This is a highly approved receipt supplied to us by a friend 
who had long experience of it iu India ; but we would suggest that 
to be really cooked so as to render it wholesome in this country, a 
larger quantity of liquid should be added to it. as one pint (or pound) 
will absorb three pints of water or broth : and the time allowed for 
stewing it appears to us insufficient for it to become really tender. 

A Persian Filaw is made much in the same manner, sometime! 
with morsels of fried kid mixed with the rice

INDIAN RBGBIFT FOR CURBISD FIBH. 

Take the fish from the bones, and cat it into inch and half sqoares; 
lay it into a stewpan with sufficient hot water to barely cover it ; 
sprinkle some salt over, and boil it gently until it is about half 
cooked. Lift it out with a fish-slice, pour the liquor into a 
basin, and dear off any scum which may be on it. Should there be 
three or four pounds of the fish, dissolve a quarter of a pound of 
butter in a stewpan, and when it has become a little brown, add two 
cloves of garlic and a large onion finely minced or sliced veiy thin ; 
fry them until they are well coloured, then add the fish; strew 
equally over it, and stir it well up with from two to three table- 
spoonsful of Bengal currie powder ; cover the pan, and shake it often 
until the fish is nicely browned ; next add by degrees the liquor in 
which it was stewed, and simmer it until it is perfectly done, but not 
so as to fall into fragments. Add a moderate quantity of lemon-juice 
or chili vinegar, and serve it very hot.

it closely corked. 

Ob8,—We cannot think a large proportion of black pepper a de- 
rirable addition to currie powder, as it gives a strong coarse flavour ; 
but as it may be liked by persons who aro accustomed to it, we give 
the preceding and the following receipt without varying either : the 
second appears to us the best.

Slke a large onion very thin, and divide it into shreds; then fiy^ 
it slowly until it is equally but not too deeply browned ; take it out 
and strain the butter, and fry in it about three ounces of rice for 
every person who is to partake of it As the gnun easily bums, it 
should be put into the nutter when it begins to simmer, and be 
very gently coloured to a bright yellow tint over a slow fire. 
Add it to some good boiling broth lightly tinged with saffron, and 
Btew it softly in a copper pan for fifteen or twenty minutes. Stir 
to it two or three ounces of butter mixed with a small portion of 
flour, a moderate seasoning of pepper or cayenne, and as much 
grated Parmesan cheese as will flavour it throughly. Boil the 
whole gently for ten minutes, and serve it very hot, at the com- 
mencement of dinner as a potage, 

Obs.—Th^ reader should brar in mind what we have so often 
repeated in this volume, that rice should always he perfectly 
cooked^ and that it will not become tender with less than three times 
its bulk of liquid. 

8TUPAT0. 
{A Neapolitan Receipt) 

^ Take about six pounds of the silver side of the round, and make 
several deep incisions in the inside, nearly through to the skin; stuff 
these with all kinds of savoury herbs, a ^^ood slice of lean ham, and 
half a small clove of garlic, all finely mmced, and well mingled to- 
gether ; then bind and tie the meat closely round, so that the stuffing 
may not escape. Put four pounds of butter into a stewpan su^ 
ficiently large to contain something more than that quantity, and the 
beef in addition ; so soon as it boils lay in the meat, let it just sim- 
mer for five or six hours, and turn it every half hour at least, that 
it may be equally done. Boil for twenty-five minutes three pounds 
of pipe maccaroni, drain it perfectly dry, and mix it with the gravy 
of the beef, without the butter, half a pint of very pure salad oil, 
and a pot of paste tomatas ; mix these to amalgamation, without 
breaking the maccaroni; before serving up, sprinkle Parmesan 
cheese thickly on the maccaroni.** 

We insert this receipt exactly as it was given to ns by a friend, 
at whose table the dish was served with great success to some Italian 
diplomatists. From our own slight experience of it, we should 
suppose that the excellence of the beef is quite a secondary con- 
sideration, as all its juices are drawn out by the mode of cooking, 
and appropriated to the maccaroni, of which we must observe that 
three pounds would make too gigantic a dish to enter well, on ordi- 
nary occasions, into an English service. 



616 MODERN COOK£RT. [chap, xxxn 

We kave somewhere seen directions for making the t^fato with 
the upper part of the sirloin, thickly larded with large, well- 
seasoned lanioons of hacon, and then stewed in equal parts of rich 
gnyy, and of red or of white wine. 

BROILED EELS WITH SAGS. (sNTRiE.) 

{Qtrman Receipt,) Chod, 

Skin, open, and cleanse one fine eel (or more), cut it into finger- 
lengths, rub it with a mixed seasoning of salt and white pepper, and 
leave it for half an hour. Wipe ft dry, wrap each length in sage 
leaves, fasten them round it with coarse thread, roll the eel in good 
salad oil or clarified butter, lay it on the gridiron, squeeze lemon- 
juice over, and broil it gently until it is browned in every part. 
Send it to table with a sauce made of two or three ounces of butter, 
a tablespoonful of chili, tarragon, or common vinegar, and one of 
water, with a little salt; to keep this smooth, proceed as for the 
Norfolk sauce of Chapter V. Broiled fish is frequently served 
without any sauce. A quite simple one may supply the place of that 
which we have indicated above : eels being of so rich a nature, re- 
quire no other. 

A SWISS MAYONNAISE. 

Beat half a pound of butter to a cream, and then add it very gra- 
dually to the nard-boiled yolks of six fresh egcs which have Seen 
cut into quarters, separated carefully from the whites, and pounded 
to a perfect paste ; when these are blended into a smooth sauce add, a 
few orops at a time, some of the finest salad oil that can be procured, 
and work the mixture in the same manner as the mayonnaise of 
Chapter VI. untU no particle of it remains visible : a small quantity of 
salt also must be thrown in, and sufficient good vinegar in very 
small portions, to give an agreeable acidity to the preparation. 

S Fresh lemon-juice might be substituted in part for this, and a little 
ine Cayenne used Avith it ; but though we suggest this, we adhere to 
our original Swiss receipt for this excellent dish, even when we think 
it might be slightly improved in flavour.) 

Carve very neatly two delicate boiled fowls, and trim the joints 
into handsome form. Lay the inferior parts upon a large plate, and 
spread a portion of the sauce, which should be veiy thick, upon 
them ; arrange them in a flat layer in the dish in which they are to 
be served; then sauce in the same way more of the joints, and 
arrange them symmetrically over the others. Proceed thus to build a 
sort of pyramid with the whole ; and decorate it with the whites of 
the eggs, and the hearts of small lettuces cut in halves. Place these 
last round the base alternately with whole bantams* or plovers' eggs, 
boiled hard . a small slice must be cut from the large end of each of 



CHJLP xxxu.J FOREIGN COOKERY. 617 

these to admit of their being placed upriffht. A slight branch of 
panley, or other foliage, may be stuck in the tops. Roast chickens 
divested entirely of the skin, can always be substituted for boiLd 
ones in a mayonnaise : they should tdl be separated into single joints 
with the exception of the wings. The quite inferior parts need not 
be used at idl. 

The same sauce rather highly flayoured with cayenne, and other 
condiments, and more or less, to the taste, with essence of anchovies 
or anchovy butter, and coloured with lobster-coral, will make an ex- 
cellent fish-salad, with alternate slices of lobster, — cut obliquely to 
increase their size, — and of cold turbot or large soles. These can be 
raised into a high border or chain round a dish when more con- 
venient, ftnd the centre filled with young fresh salad, sauced at the 
instant it is sent to table. 

A French mayonnaise does not vary much from the preceding, 
except in the composition of the sauce, for which see Chapter YI. 
It should alwa^ be kept very thick. A little rich cold white sauce 
is sometimes mixed with it. 



TENDRONS DE TEAU. 

The tendrnu (or gristles') which lie imder the flesh of the brisket 
of a breast of veal are mucn used in forei^ coimtries, and frequently 
now in this, to supply a variety of the dishes called entries. When 
long stewed they become perfectly tender, and yield a large amount 
of gelatine ; lut they are quite devoid of flavour, and require there- 
fore to be coolied and served with such additions as shall render them 
palatable. 

With a ver^ sharp knife detach the flesh from them without 
separating it fiom the joint, and turn it back, so as to allow the 
gristles to be divided easily from the long bones. Cut away the 
chine-bone fron their outer edge, and then proceed first to soak 
them, that they may be veiy white, and to boil them gently for 
several hours,* dther quite simply, in good broth, or with additions 
of bacon, spice, aid vegetables. Foreign cooks braise them somewhat 
expensively, and then serve them in many different forms ; but as 
they make, after sll, but a rather unpretending entrie^ some economy 
in their preparation would generally be desirable. They may be 
divided at the joiats, and cut obliquely into thin slices before they 
are stewed, when they will require but four hours simmering ; or 
they may be left entire and braised, when they will require, while 
still warm, to be pressed between two dishes with a heavy weight on 
the top, to bring them into good shape before they are divided for

and fHed in thin slices of uniform size ; or steered tender, then well 
drained^ and glazed, dished in a cirde, and served with peas d la 
Franqain in the centre, or with a thick purie of tomatas, or of other 
vegetables. They are also often used to fill voi-mt-oeiUv, for which 

furpose they must be kept very white, and mixed with a good 
^AameZ-sanoe. We recommend their being highly curried, either 
in co^junctibn with plenty of v^;etables, or with a portion of other 
meat, after they have been baked or stewed as tender as possible. 

POITRINE DE YEAU GLACiE. 

(BreoMt of Veal Stewed and Glazed.) 

When the gristles have been removed firom a breast of veal, the 
joint will still make an excellent roast, or serve to stew or braise. 
Take out the long-bones,* beat the veal with the flat side of a 
cleaver, or with a cutlet-bat, and when it is quite even, cut it square, 
and sprinkle over it a moderate seasoning of fine salt, cayenne, and 
mace. Make so me fo rcemeat by either of the receipts N03. 1, 2, 3, or 
7, of Chapter VilL, but increase the incredients to three or four 
times the quantity, according to the size of the joint Lay over the 
veal, or not, as is most convenient, thin slices of half-boLed bacon, or 
of ham ; press the forcemeat into the form of a short compact ratUeam 
and lay it in the centre of one side of the breast ; then roll it up and 
skewer the ends closely with small skewers, and bind the joint firmly 
into good form with tape or twine. When thus prepared, it may he 
slowly stewed in very good veal stock until it is tender quite through, 
and which should be hot when it is lud in ; or embedded in the usual 
ingredients for braising (see Chapter IX., page 180), and sent to table 
glazed, sauced with an Eipagnole^ or other rich gravr, and garnished 
with carrots d ia Windsor (see page 335), or with sweet-bread cut-

forcemeat (ITo. 7). Mushroom-sauce is always an excellent accom- 
paniment to a joint of veal. The liquor in which the hreast is 
stewed or hraised is too fat to serve as sauce until it has been cooled 
and cleared. The yeal can be cooked without boning, but will have 
but an indifferent appearance- It should in that case be slowly 
brought to boil, and very gently simmered : about two hours and a 
half will stew it tender. The sweetbread, after being scalded, may 
be stewed with it for half the time, and served upon it. 

Obs. — The breast without the gristles, boned and filled with 
forcemeat, makes a superior roast n may also be boiled on occasion, 
and served with balls of oyster-foro^meat in the dish ; or with white 
mushroom-sauce instead. 

COMPOTE DB PIOBONS (sTEWED PIGEONS.) 

The French in much of their cookery use more bacon than would 
ffenerally be suited to a very delicate taste, we think. This bacon, 
from being cured without saltpetre, and from not being smoked, 
rather resembles salt pork in flavour : we explain this that the 
Trader may, when so oisposed, adapt the receipts we give here to an 
English table by omitting it. Cut into dice from half to three 
quarters of a pound of streaked bacon, and fry it ^ntly in a larse 
stewpan with a morsel of butter until it is very lightly browned ; 
lift it out, and put in three or four young pi|;eons trussed as for 
boiling. When they have become firm, and lightly coloured, lift 
them out, and stir a large tablespoonful of flour to the fat. When 
this thickening (rota) is also slightly browned, add gradually to it 
a pint, or something more, of boilinp^ veal-stock or strong broth ; 
put back the birds and the bacon, with a few small button-onions 
when their flavour is liked, and stew the whole very gently for three 
quarters of an hour. Dish the pigeons neatly with the bacon and 
onions laid between them ; skim all the fat from the sauce, reduce it 
quickly, and strain it over them. The birds should be laid into the 
stewpan with the breasts downwards. 

The third, or half of a pottle of small mushrooms is sometimes 
added to this dkh. It may be converted into a compote mix petit» 

meat, to which let a little minced shalot be added, and spread It orer the TeaL 
If yon have any cold tongu$ or lean of ham, out it in square strips, and lay them 
the short way of the meat that they may be shewn when it is caired. AoU it 
vp very tight, and keep it in good shape ; enclose it in a cloth as yon would a 
jam-pudding, and lace it up well, then lay it into a braising-nan with three 
onions, as many large carrots thickly slioea, some spice, sweet herbs, and suf- 
ficient fresh second-stock or strong Teal broth to more than half corer it, and 
stew it very gently orer a slow fire for three hours : torn it oocasionally without 
disturbing the hrmu which surrounds it. Qlaze it before it is sent to table, and 
serre it with Spanish sauce, or with rich English brown gravy, flavoured with a 
glass of sherry ; and gamiah it with stewed mushrooms in small heaps, )

voit by adding to the pigeons when the broth, in which they are 
laid^ first b^ns to boil, a pint and a half of young teas. For these, 
a pint and a quarter, at the least, of liquid will be required, and 
a nill hour*B stewinj^. The economist can substitute water for the 
broth. When the birds can be had at little cost, one, two, or more, 
according to circumstances, should be stewed down to make broth 
or sauce for the others. 

Ob*. — ^Pigeons are excellent filled with the mushrooms au betare^ of 
page 329, and either roasted or stewed. To broil them proceed as 
directed for a partridge (French receipt), page 290. 

MAI TRANK (maY-DRINE). 

(^Oerman,) 

Put into a lar^ deep jug one pint of light white wine to two of 
red, and dissolve in it sufficient sugar to sweeten it agreeably. Wipe 
a sound China orange, cut it in rather thick slices, without paring it, 
and add it to the wine ; then throw in some 
small bunches or faggots of the fragrant little 
plant called woodruff; cover the jug closel^r to 
exclude the air and leave it until the following 
day. Serve it to all May^day visitors. One 
orange will be sufiicient for three pints of wine. 
The woodruff should be washed and well drained 
before it is thrown into the jug ; and the 
quantity of it used should not be very large, or 
tne flavour of the beverage will be rather in- 
jured than improved by it. We have tried this 
receipt on a small scale with lemon-rind instead 
of oranges, and the mixture was very agreeable. 
Rhenish wine should properly be used for it; 
but this is expensive m England. The woodruff is more odorous 
when dried gradually in the shade than when it is fresh gathered, 
and imparts a pleasant fragrance to linen, as lavender does. It 
grows wild in Kent, Surrey, and other parts of England, and 
flourishes in many suburban gardens in the neighbourhood of 
London. 

A TIBNNESB SOUFFLi - PUDDING, CALLED SALZBURGER 
NOCKERL. 

At the moment of going to press, we have received direct from 
"Vienna the following receipt, which we cannot resist offering to the 
reader for trial, as we are assured that the dish is one of die most 
delicate and delicious souffle -puddings that can be made. 




CHAP, xxxn.] FOREIGN COOKERY. 621 

(A) Take batter, four onnc^; sugar in powder, three ounces; 
fine flour, one ounce and a half or two ounces ; and the yellow of 
eight eggs ; beat these together in a convenient sized basin till the 
mixture gets frothy. (The butter should probably first be beaten to 
cream.) 



(B) ' Beat to snow the whites of the eight eg^. 



(C) Take three pounds (or pints) of new milk, put it in an open 
Btewpan over a gentle fire, and let it boil. 

(D) Next, prepare a china casserole (enamelled stewpan — a 
copper one will do) by greasing its internal surface. 

As soon as the milk l^ils, mix gently a and b together, and with a 
small spoon take portions of this shape and size 
and la^ them over the surface of the boiling milk 
till it is entirely covered with them. Let them 
boil for four or five minutes to cook them ; then put them in oon- 
yenient order on the ground of the greased casserole (stewpan). Gro 
on putting in the same manner small portions of the mixture on the 
surface of the boiling milk, and when cooked, place a new layer of 
them in the stewpan over the first ; and continue the same operation 
until the mixture is all consumed. Take now the remainder of the 
milk, and add it to the beaten yellow (yolks) of two eges, some sugar, 
and some powdered yanilla. rour this over the cooked pastry in the 
stewpan, and set it into a gently heated oven. Leave it there until 
it gets brown ; then powder it with vanilla-sugar, and send it to the 
table. 



Author^ s Note. — The preceding directions were written by a physi- 
cian of Vienna, at whose table the dish was served. It was turned 
out of the casserole, and served with the greatest expedition ; but we 
think it would perhaps answer more generally here, to bake it in a 
souffle dish, and to leave it undisturbed. We would also suggest, 
that the yolk of a third egg might sometimes be needed to bind 
the mixture well together. A good and experienced cook would 
easily ascertain the best mode of ensuring the success of the pre« 
paration. 

We must observe, that the form of the enamelled stewpans 
made commonly in this country prevents their being well adapted 
for use in the present receipt : those of copper are better suited 
to it 

Half the proportion of the ingredients might, by way of ex))eri* 
ment, be prepared and baked in a tart-dish, as our puddings fre- 
quently are ; or in a small round cake mould, with a buid of writing 
paper fastened round the top. 

The yanilla sugar is prepared by cutting the bean up small and 
pounding it with some sugar in a mortar, and then passing it through 
a yery fine neve
