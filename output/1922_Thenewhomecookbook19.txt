Bread 

The Staff of Life. 

Probably no food is more generally used than bread, 
and to be able to make a perfect loaf is the ambition of 
every woman who aspires to cook well. 

One essential for good bread is good yeast. Tliis is 
in different forms — one of which is 

Compressed Yeast. 

This is a very convenient and reliable lorm. It is 
very quick and satisfactory but will not keep long. In 
just a day or so it begins to die. 

Dried Yeast. 

This may be kept for some time and by soaking be- 
fore mixing gives very good results. 

Home Made Yeast. 

This is a mixture of flour, water and potatoes with 
dry yeast as a starter and probably is one of the best 
yeasts used; but one must remember that yeasts are 
plants and all vessels used for it must be kept very clean 
or bacteria will form and give the bread a very unpleasant 
flavor. 

Yeast plants grow best at a temperature of 77° to 95° 
F. A lower temperature retards the growth while a 
higlier kills the plants, thereby spoiling the bread. So 
the temperature of the dough is very important. 

The yeast, as it grows, digests the flour and sugar 
by means of a fluid which it secretes and changes them 
into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. The alcohol is 
driven out by the heat of the Qven, the gas expands mak- 
ing the bread light and porous, and the yeast is killed. 

Another essential is good flour. Flour is made by 



grinding grain; wheat flour being the most important 
in Europe and North America, and containing five food 
elements : water, protein, fat, carbohydrates and ash. 

The protein is chiefly in the form of gluten which 
stretches and expands, holding the air and gas, forming 
the frame work of the bread, and hardens when baked. 

Flour from winter wheat is whiter and smoother, 
more like corn starch, and contains little gluten. This is 
soft wheat or pastry flour. When squeezed in the hand 
it retains the imprint of the fingers. 

Flour from spring wheat is creamy color, feels gran- 
ular, and if squeezed in the hand will fall apart as the 
hand opens. This contains more gluten and is known as 
''strong" flour. 

A good bread flour contains a larger per cent of 
gluten, is creamy in color, granular to the touch and ab- 
sorbs more moisture than a poor one. 

Sugar is another ingredient of bread. It is food for 
the yeast and shortens the time for rising, but too much 
sugar causes toughness of both crust and crumb. About 
2 teaspoons to the loaf should be used. 

Salt, another ingredient, gives flavor to the bread, 
but a large quantity retards the growth of the j^east. 

1 cup liquid (scalded milk or water). 

2 teaspoons sugar. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

2 tablespoons lard or butter. 
1/4 cake yeast. 

6 cups flour (or more). 

This makes one medium sized loaf. 

Break up the yeast and put to soak in about two 
tablespoons of warm water. Add the sugar to the warm 
milk or water, add the dissolved yeast and about half of 
the flour. Beat until smooth. This is sponge. Cover 
this and let stand in a warm (about 88°) place until full 
of bubbles. Now add the salt, shortening, and enough 
flour to make a smooth elastic dough. Turn on a well 
floured board and knead, adding more flour if necessary. 



Too much flour makes the bread hard, but enough to keep 
the dough from sticking to the hands is necessary. Place 
the dough in a greased bowl, cover with cloth and let 
stand in warm place until doubled in size. It may then 
be kneaded and made into loaf or placed back in bowl, let 
rir'e again and then made into loaf. (The latter gives 
better results.) 

A greased pan about 9x4 inches is used. When the 
loaf rises to twice the size it is ready to bake. 

Test the oven with a piece of luhite paper. It should 
turn a gulden brown in 5 minutes. Bake from 45 to 60 
minutes. It should brown in the first 15 minutes and 
heat should be lowered the last 20 minutes. If coal fire 
is used, have enough fuel in stove when bread is placed 
in oven to avoid replenishing fire until bread is removed. 

When loaf is removed from oven place so air may 
circulate on all sides of it. When cool place in tin or 
stone jar which should be scalded often. 

Bread sliced lengthwise of loaf is much better than 
when sliced crosswise. 

Bread. 

Sponge. 

1 cake yeast foam 

1 quart lukewarm water 

2 tablespoons salt 

2 tablespoons sugar 
2 tablespoons lard 
flour 

Put yeast to soak in Mi cup wann water in afternoon, 
set sponge at night and make stiff as can be stirred with 
spoon, set to rise over night in warm place. 

In morning, sift flour, add sponge, salt, sugar, lard 
and water and mix with spoon until stiff, then knead in 
flour with hands and then knead on boara until very 
smooth. Let rise in greased pan, knead down and let rise 
agam, form into loaves and let rise again until twice the ' 
height. Bake from 45 to 60 minutes.

the salt sifted in to make a stiff batter. Let rise, then make

How to Whip Jell-0. 

If you have never whipped Jell-0 and know nothing 
about the process, you will be glad to know mat it is as 
simple a matter as whipping thick cream. Begin to whip 
the jelly while it is still liquid — cold but not yet congeal- 
ing — and whip till it is of the consistency of thick whipped 
cream. Use a Dover egg-beater and keep the Jell-0 cold 
while whipping by setting the dish in cracked ice, ice 
water or very cold water. A tin or aluminum quart meas- 
ure is an ideal utensil for the purpose. Its depth prevents 
spattering, and tin and aluminum admit quickly the chill 
of the ice or cold water. Add cream or whatever else goes 
into the dessert after — not before — whipping the Jell-0^ 
The whipping process more than doubles the quantity of 
plain Jell-0, so that when whipped one package of Jell-0 
serves twelve persons instead of six.

Use very little water in roasting meats. Your roast will not 
shrink and all the natural juices will be retained. The meat will be 
much more delicious in flavor and much more nourishing. 

You will save from 15 to 20 per cent of the weight of every roast 
cooked in this electric oven. 

If you wish to retain all of the juices in the meat, do not season 
it until cooked. If you prefer to season it before cooking, put the 
seasoning on a piece of suet, which should be laid on the meat.

Time required for cooking depends somewhat upon the age, freshness and 
size of vegetables. 

Cauliflower, spinach, and green corn should not be cooked overtime. 

DON'T use more than 2-3 of a cup of water in cooking vegetables. 

DON'T forget to put cover on cooking utensils. This prevents steam 
from escaping and food will cook more quickly. 

All vegetables for a meal can be cooked in the same oven with meats, 
with absolutely no exchange of flavors. 

"►On semi-automatic ranges the current should be turned off by hand 
when the indicator reaches the desired point. 

tWhen started in a cold oven, add half the time required to heat the oven 
to the desired temperature, as noted on page 5. 

All boiled vegetables maximum temperature l^^. WTien boiling veg«^- 
tables or meats set directly on burner. 



Use not more than 2-3 of a teacup of water and a maximum tem- 
perature of 11/2 for boiling fresh vegetables in oven.
