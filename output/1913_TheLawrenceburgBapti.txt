Preface. 

^^f <^* c^* ^^ 

The numerous calls for our cook book has made nec- 
essary the issuance of this edition, which we give to the 
public in a revised and enlarged form, believing it will 
meet with favor. A great many new recipes have been 
added, which are the contributions of some of our best 
housewives; to them and to all \Vho have rendered assist- 
ance, we wish to gratefully acknowledge our indebtedness. 
It is with the hope that we have done something toward 
the improvement of human food, that we send this vol- 
ume forth.

MEATS. 

^* t^ i^ f^ 

Boiling. 

Meat, in order to be tender, should be gently boiled, 
rather than boiled fast; cook in a closely covered kettle, 
and if necessary to add more water, use boiling water. A 
little vinegar put in the water with tough meat or poul- 
try will make it tender. Very salt meats or dried meats 
should be soaked over night in cold water before cooking. 
Allow twenty or thirty minutes to each pound of meat 
when cooking. 

Frying. 

The fat must be very hot and deep enough to entirely 
immerse article to be fried. A coating is thus formed 
on the outside and in this way kept from absorbing 
grease. Another method of frying, is to put the article 
in a very hot skillet with a small amount of fat, which 
gives it the seasoning of a broil. 

Roasting. 

Put on rack in roaster, put a little hot water in bottom 
of pan with some pieces of fat from meat; dredge with 
salt, pepper and flour. Have oven very hot at first in 
order to cook meat on outside and thus prevent the 
juices from escaping. After half an hour reduce the 
40 



Meats. 41 

heat and cook slowly. Baste with with water in bottom 
of pan. 

Broiling. 

In broiling, the meat is to be quickly browned, turning 
often, (first on one side, then the other, over a hot fire.

Ctit firm bacon into very narrow strips with a sharp 
knife ; place one end in a larding needle, draw it through 
the skin and a small bit of the meat, leaving the strip 
of pork in the meat. The two ends left exposed should 
be of equal length. The larding may be arranged in any 
way to suit the fancy. If you have no larding needle, 
the strips may be tied on and strings removed before 
sending meat to table. 

To Broil Steak. 

Grease broiler or skillet with some fat from steak, have 
it very hot; put in steak and turn frequently, searing on

CAKES. 

C^ tf^* c^ c^ 

All materials for cake should be fresh and of the very 
best quality. After reading recipe, collect all ingredients 
called for. Sift flour and sugar before measuring, using 
fine granulated sugar land well dried iflour; then separate 
eggs, beating each well. The best cooks also wash the 
butter, although some, who make good cake, do not adhere 
strictly to this rule. Before mixing cake, prepare mold by 
lining it with brown paper and greasing well with melted 
lard. If a layer cake, it is usually sufficient to grease pans 
and dust them well with flour, then invert pan and shake 
out gently the superfluous flour. Have oven moderately hot 
when cakes are put in, then gradually increase the heat 
as the cake rises. When baking a mold cake, put a thick 
paper or tin top over it, also a pan of hot water on grate 
in oven ; after it has risen sufficiently, the top may be re- 
moved and, when beginning to brown, remove hot water. 
A cake is usually done when it shrinks from the pan or 
mold. Insert a broom-straw into the thickest part, and 
if it comes out clean, the cake is done. Open and shut 
oven door carefully while cakes are rising; if necessary ^o 
turn them, do so gently. Use a wooden cake spoon with 
slits in it for mixing cake and beat batter well if you want 
a fine grained cake.

Wash butter and cream it, adding sugar gradually, beat- 
ing until light and creamy; a little of the liquid added 
will help wdth the creaming process, w^hich is very neces- 
sary to the success of the cake. If a recipe calls for yelks 
off eggs, beat them until light and add to creamed butter 
and sugar. Add flour and milk alternately, then stiffly 
beaten whites. Fine cakes can be made without beat- 
ing whites, but the batter must be well beaten after 
they are added. Layer cakes will bake in from twenty- 
five to thirty minutes according to thickness. Mold cakes 
require from fifty minutes to two hours. Cake batter may 
be baked in large thin sheets, then cut in rounds, triangles 
or fancy shapes and iced in different colors, sprinkled with 
cocoanut, chopped nuts, etc. 

To Mix Sponge Cahe w Angel Food. 

'When yelks of eggs are used, beat them very light, add 
sugar, then beaten whites, then fold in flour and cream 
tartar. For angel food, beat whites of eggs very stiff, 
add cream tartar and beat well, then add sugar, folding 
it in thoroughly and carefully. Then fold in flour lightly, 
the motion being one of cutting through batter at bottom 
and lifting it towards the surface. Do not beat. Turn 
the mixture into ungreased mold or pans and invert on 
wire cake cooler until it drops out.

How To Mix Fruit Cake. 

Have fruit prepared before beginning to mix eake. Have 
raisins seeded, and cut up, citron shaved, currants picked 
over, washed and dried, almonds blanched and cut up. 
Dredge fruit and nuts by putting them in a large pan and 
sifting a little flour over them, mixing it through well 
with the hands; this is to prevent fruit from falling to 
the bottom of cake. For black cake, brown the flour, by 
putting a pan of white flour in oven and stirring constant- 
ly until it is browned evenly all through. Prepare this, 
too, beforehand. Mix batter las for plain cake, puting in 
ingredients in same order, unless molasses is used, which 
must be added before flour. If brandy is used, add just 
before fruits and nuts which are added last. Put in mold, 
set in a pan containing two or three inches of hot water, 
put thick paper or top over mold and bake very slowly. 
Put a pan of hot water on rack. Let cake remain in mold 
until cold.

PRESERVES, JELLIES, Etc.

vor of the fruit. The usual proportion is one pound of 
6ugar to each pound of fruit for preserves; for jellies, al- 
low equal measures of fruit juice and sugar. A combi- 
nation of fruits, as apples and grapes, makes nice jelly; 
avoid the use of over-ripe fruit for jellies.

and blossom end; divide into quarters, but do not pare. 
Put into kettle with half as much water as fruit ; simmer

squeezing. Allow equal measures of juice and sugar. Boil 
10 to 20 minutes. — ^Mrs. McCarter.

cans full, set on a wet folded towel and till to overflowing 
with a syrup made by cooking together one cup of sugar 
(for each pint Jar) and one-half cup of water. Put on 
rubbers and screw on tops tightly. Lay a thick cloth in 
the botto'm of a boiler, have in it boiling water to come 
to the rims of cans and set the cans in it; cover closely
