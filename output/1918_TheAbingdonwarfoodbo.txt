FOREWORD 

I HAVE read with lively interest John Wes- 
ley's "Thoughts" about food difficulties. The 
difficulties that he noted in 1773 are still with 
us. Some people have too much food and 
some have too little. Such conditions have 
always existed and always will exist under 
our present social organization — and perhaps 
under any possible social organization. 

But at the present time we have newer and 
greater food problems; they are international 
problems. Now it is some nations, not only 
individuals, who have more food than is 
necessary, while others stand face to face 
with national starvation. Our duty, therefore, 
is a double one. We must try to solve in 
some measure the great international food 
problems and at the same time not forget 
those more individual problems of which 
Wesley spoke. And the solving of the greater 
will help us in the solution of the lesser prob- 
lems, for the stimulus of the present inter- 
national food situation serves to arouse the 
interest of everyone in all food problems. 

So it may be, when the war is past, we shall 

5 



6 FOREWORD 

be able to turn from the international food 
problems to those that Wesley noted with a 
new interest and a more active endeavor. 
Faithfully yours, 

Herbert Hoover. 



INTRODUCTION— THE WORLD 
FOOD PROBLEM 

Wise old John Wesley's words uttered a 
century and a half ago remind us that the 
food problem is no new thing and that waste 
or ill-directed use of food has been the cause 
of suffering wherever and whenever it oc- 
curred. 

But there is a reason for food difficulties 
to-day to which Wesley does not refer. War, 
and war on a scale of this greatest war of all 
time, can produce swiftly a shortage of food 
for whole peoples, including rich and poor 
alike. It does this by reducing production 
and obstructing distribution. So that the food 
problem to-day is not simply that of Wesley's 
day, which was to find some way of getting 
sufficient food to the very poor, but it is a 
problem of finding sufficient food for nations. 

In Belgium there are many rich people as 
well as many poor, but all depend for their 
daily bread on a meager, but equal, ration. 
The Belgian banker gets no more bread than 
the Belgian workman. And that either banker 
or workman get any at all depends upon an 



8 INTRODUCTION 

extraordinary arrangement involving the con- 
sent of various other nations and the efforts 
of a foreign relief organization. 

Even in England and France and Italy, 
which are not inclosed, as Belgium is, in a 
merciless ring of steel, there is only bread 
enough for the people to keep alive because 
of the voluntary sharing with them by an- 
other nation which is commonly interested 
with them in the prosecution of a great strug- 
gle for liberty. 

In each country of the world to-day the 
food difficulties described by Wesley obtain in 
some measure, but above all these difficulties 
is the far greater one of the division among 
nations of a greatly diminished food supply. 
It is America's special and extraordinary re- 
sponsibility in connection with this greatest 
of all food problems ever known that de- 
mands to-day so much thought and work and 
personal sacrifice on the part of all of our 
people. 

And this problem will not pass immediately 
with the passing of the war. The exhaustion 
of all food stocks and the underfeeding for a 
long period of hundreds of millions of people 
will insure an extraordinary food demand for 
a number of years to come after peace has 
been made. Combined with this world-hun- 



INTRODUCTION" 9 

ger will be a shortage of world-shipping, and 
at the same time there will be great demands 
on this shortened shipping for the repatriation 
of millions of soldiers and the carrying of 
millions of tons of raw materials and ma- 
chines to stripped countries that they may 
rehabilitate their industries. The ships can- 
not all be used to carry food. 

So there must be food economy not only 
now but for years to come. We in America 
must save food not only that the allied na- 
tions may be kept alive now, but after the 
war. Our food problem has only been partly 
formulated so far. We must begin to try to 
formulate it in terms more nearly complete. 
It is not only a problem of to-day; it is a 
problem of to-morrow as well. And we shall 
do well to recognize that now.

THOUGHTS, ^r. 




ANY excellent things have 
been lately publifhed, con- 
cerning the prefent Scarcity 
of Provifions, And many 
Caufes have been afligned for it, by 
Men of Experience and Refledlon. 
But may it not be obferved, there is 
fomething wanting ftlll, in moft of 
thofe Publications ? One Writer af- 
figns and infifts on one Caufe ; ano- 
ther on one or two more. But who 
afligns all the Caufes that manifeflly 
concur, to produce this melancholy 
Effect ? At the fame time pointing 
B out 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 13 



( 4 ) 

out, how each particular Caufe aiFe^ls 
the Price of each particular Sort of 
Provifion ? 

I would willingly offer to candid 
and benevolent Men, a few Hints on 
this important Subject ; Propofing a 
few Queftions, and fubjoining to each 
what feems to be the plain and di- 
rect Anfwer. 

I. I. I aik, firfl:, Why are thou- 
fands of people ftarving, perifhing 
for Want, in every part of the Na- 
tion ? The Fad I know : I have 
feen it with my eyes, in every cor- 
ner of the Land. I have known 
thofe who could only afford to eat 
a little coarfe Food once every o- 
ther Dayv I have known one in 
Londorty (and one that a few Years 
before had all the Conveniencies of 
Life) picking up from a Dunghill 
Jiinkmg Sprats, and carrying them 
home for herfelf and her Children* 

I 



14 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



( 5 ) 

I have known another gathering the 
Bones which the Dogs had left in the 
Streets, and making Broth of them, 
to prolong a wretched Life ! I have 
heard a third artlefly declare, " In- 
deed I was very faint, aild fo weak 
I could hardly walk, 'till my Dog, 
finding nothing at home, went out, 
and brought in a good fort of Bone % 
which / took out of his Mouth, and 
made a pure Dinner I " Such is the 
cafe at this Day of multitudes of 
People, in a Land flowing, as it 
were, with Milk and Honey ! A- 
boundlng with all the Neceflaries, 
the Conveniencies, the Superfluities 
of Life ! 

Now why is this ? Why have 
all thefe nothing to eat ? Becauie 
they have nothing to do. The plain 
reafon, why they have no Meat, is 
becaufe they have no Work. 

a. But why have they no Work ? 
B 2 Why 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 15 



{ 6 ) 

Why are {o many thoufand People, 
in London, in Brijlol, in Norwich, 
in every Coiinty, from one End of 
England to the other, utterly delli- 
tute of Employment? 

Becaufe the Perfons that ufed to 
employ them cannot afford to do it 
any longer. Many that employed 
fifty Men, now fcarce employ ten : 
Thofe that employed twenty, now 
employ one, or none at all. They 
cannot, as they have no Vent for 
their Goods : Food being fo dear, 
that the generality of People are hard- 
ly able to buy any Thing elfe. 

3. But why is Food fo dear ? To 
come to particulars: Why does 
Bread-corn bear fo high a Price? 
To fet afide partial Caufes, (which 
indeed, all put together, are little 
more than the Fly upon the Chariot- 
Wheel) the grand Caufe is, Becaufe 
fuch immenfe Quantities of Corn are 

continually 



i6 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



( 7 ) 

continually confumed by DtJlllUng. 
Indeed an eminent Diftiller, near 
London, hearing this, warmly replied, 
*' Nay, my Partner and I general- 
ly diftil but a thoufand garters a- 
Week. ** Perhaps fo. And fuppofe 
five and twenty Diftillers in and near 
the Town, confume each only the 
fame ^antityi Here are five and 
twenty thoufand Quarters a Week, 
that is above twelve hundred and fif- 
ty thoufand a Year, confumed in and 
about London ! Add the Diftillers 
throughout England, and have we 
not reafbn to believe, that (not a 
thirtieth, or a twentieth Part only, 
but) little lefs than half the Wheat 
produced in the Kingdom, is every 
Year confumed, not by fo harmlefs 
a way as throwing it into the Sea, 
but by converting it into deadly Poi- 
fon : Poifon that naturally deftroys 
not only the Strength and Life, but 
alfo the Morals of our Countrymen ? 

It 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 17 



( 8 ) 

It may be objeded, " This can- 
not be. We know how much Corn 
is diftilled by the Duty that is paid. 
And hereby it appears, that fcarce 
three hundred thoufand ' Quarters a 
Year are diftlUed throughout the 
Kingdom. " Do we know, certain- 
ly, How much Corn is diftilled, by 
the Duty that is paid ? Is it indi{^ 
putable, that the full Duty is paid, 
for all the Corn tjiat is diftilled ? 
Not to infift upon the multitude of 
private Stills^ which pay no Duty at 
all. I have myfelf heard the Ser- 
vant of an eminent Difliller occafion- 
ally aver. That for every Gallon he 
diftilled, which paid Duty, he dil^ 
tilled fix, which paid none. Yea, 
I have heard Diftillers themfelves 
affirm, " We muft do this, or we 
caimot live. " It plainly follows, 
we cannot judge from the Duty that 
is paid, of the Quantity of Corn 
that is diftilled. 

*^ However, 



i8 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



{ 9 ) 

*' However, what is paid brings 
in a large Revenue to the King. " — 
Is this an Equivalent for the Lives 
of his Subjects ? Would his Ma- 
jefty fell an hundred thoufand of his 
Subjects yearly to Algiers^ for four 
hundred thoufand Pounds? Surely 
no. Will he then fell them for that 
Sum, to be butchered, by their own 
Countrymen? — ** But otherwife the 
Swine for the Navy cannot be fed. " 
Not unlefs they are fed with human 
Flefh ! Not unlefs they are fatted 
with human Blood ! O tell it not in 
Conjlanttnopky That the EngUJh raife 
the Royal Revenue, by felling the 
Flefh and Blood of their Country- 



4. But why are Oais fo dear ? — 
Becaufe there are four times as many 
Horfes kept (to fpeak within com- 
pafs) for Coaches and Chaifes in par- 
ticular, as were a few Years ago. 

Unlefs 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 19 



( 'o ) 

Unlefs therefore four tlpies the Oats 
grew now, that grew then, they can- 
not be at the fame Price. If only 
twice as much is produced, (which 
perhaps, is near the truth) the Price 
will naturally be double to what it 
was. 

An4 as the Dearnefs of Grain 
of one kind, will always raife 
the Price of another, fo whatever 
caufes the Dearnefs of Wheat and 
Oats, muft raife the Price of Barley 
too. To account therefore for the 
Dearnefs of this, we need only re- 
member what has been obferved a- 
bove : Altho* fome particular ciufes 
may concur, in producing the fame 
effea. 

5. Why are Beef and Mutton fb 
dear? Becauie many confiderable 
Farmers^ particularly in the Nor- 
thern Counties, who ufed to breed 

large 



20 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



( " ) 

large Numbers of Sheep, or horned 
Cattle, and very frequently both; 
now breed none at all : They no lon- 
ger trouble themfelves with either 
Sheep, or Cows, or Oxen : As they 
can turn their Land to far better Ac- 
count, by breeding Horfes alone. — 
Such is the Demand not only for 
Coach and Chalfe Horfes, which are 
bought and deftroy'd in incredible 
numbers ; but much more for bred 
Horfes, which are yearly export- 
ed, by hundreds, yea thoufands, to 
France. 

6. But why are Porh, Poultry and 
B.ggs fb dear ? Becaufe of the mono- 
polizing of Farms : Perhaps as mif- 
chievous a Monopoly, as was ever in- 
troduced into thefe Kingdoms. The 
Latid which was fome Years ago di- 
vided, between ten or twenty little 
Farmers, and enabled them comfor- 
tably to provide for their Families, 

is 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 21 



( >i ) 

is now generally engroffed by one 
great Farmer. One farms an Eftate 
of a thoufand a Year, which for- 
merly maintained ten or twenty. — 
Every one of thefe little Farmers 
kept a few Swine, with fome Quan- 
tity of Poultry : And having little 
Money : was glad to fend his Ba- 
con, or Pork, or Fowls and Eggs 
to Market continually. Hence the 
Markets were plentifully ferved: 
And Plenty created Cheapnefs. But 
at prefent, the great, the Gentlemen- 
Farmers, are above attending to 
thefe little Things. They breed no 
Poultry ot Swine ; unlefs for their 
own Ufe: conlequently they fend 
none to Market. Hence it is not 
flrange, if two or three of thefe, 
living near a Market Town, occaflon 
fuch a Scarcity of thefe tilings, by 
preventing the former Supply, that 
the Price of them is double or treble 
to what it was before. Hence (to

inftance iii a fmall Article) in the 
fame Town, wherein within my me- 
mory. Eggs were fold fix or eight 
a penny, they are now fold fix or 
eight a gToat. 

Another Caufo, (the moft terrible 
one of all, and the moft deftru£live 
both of perfonal and focial Happi- 
nefs) why not only Beef, Mutton, 
and Pork, btit all kinds of Viduals 
are fo dear, is Luxury, What can 
ftand againft this? Will it not 
wafte and deftroy all that Nature 
find Art can produce ? If a Perfon 
of Quality will boil down three 
dozen of Neat's Tongues, to make 
two or three Quarts of Soup, (and 
fo proportionably in other things) 
what wonder that Provifions fail r — 
Only look into the Kitchins of the 
Great, the Nobility and Gentry, al- 
moft without exception, (confider- 
ing withal, that " the Toe of the 
C Peafant 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 23 



( 14) 

Peafant treads upon the Heel of the 
Courtier : ") And when you have ob- 
ferved the amazing Wafte which is 
made there, you will no longer won- 
der at the Scarcity, and confequently 
Dearnefs, of the Things which they 
ufe fo much Art to deftroy. 

7. But Why is Land fo dear? 

Becaufe on all thefe Accounts, 
Gentlemen cannot live as they have 
been accuftomed to do, without in- 
creafing their Income; which moft 
of them cannot do, but by ralfing 
their Rents. And then the Farmer 
paying an higher Rent for the Land, 
muft have an higher Price for the 
Produce of it. This again tends to 
r^fe the Price of Land : And fo the 
Wheel runs round. 

8. But Why is it, that not Qnly 
Provifions and Land, but well nigh 
every Thing elfe is fo dear ? 

Becaufe 



24 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



('5) 

Becaufe of the enormous ftaxes^ 
which are laid on almoft every Thing 
that can be named. Not only abun- 
dant Taxes are raifed, from Earth, 
ahd Fire, and Water : But in Efig- 
landy the ingerriouS Statefmen have 
found a way, to lay a Tax upon the 
very L'ght ! Yet one Ekment re- 
mains : And furely fome Man of 
Honour will find a way to tax this 
alfo. For how long fhall the fancy 
Air, ftrike a Gentleman on the Face, 
nay a Lord, without paying for it ? 

9. But \Vhy are the 'Taxes fo high ? 

Becaufe of the 'National Debt. — 
They muft be fo, while this conti- 
nues. I have heard, that the na- 
tional Expence, feventy Years ago, 
was in time of Peace, three Millions 
a Year. And now the bare Intcreft 
of the public Debt, amounts yearly 
C 2 to 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 25 



( 16 ) 

above four Millions ! To ralfe which, 
with the other ftated Expences of 
Government, thofe Taxes are abfo- 
lutely neceflary. 

To fum up the whole. Thoufands 
of People throughout the Land, are 
perilling for want of Food, This 
is owing to various Caufes ; but a- 
bove all, to DlfiJI/mg^ T'axcsy and 
Luxury, 

Here is the Evil, and the unde- 
niable Caufes of it. But where is 
the Remedy ? 

Perhaps it exceeds all the "WiC- 
dom of Man to tell : But it may 
not be amifs to offer a few Hints on 
the Subjed. 

IL I. What Remedy is there for 
this fore Evil, — Many thoufand poor 
People are flarving? 

Find 



26 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



( '7 ) 

Find them Work, and you wili 
find them Meat. They will then 
earn and eat their own Bread. 

2. But how can the Mafters give 
them Work, without ruining them- 
felves ? 

Procure Vent for what is wrought, 
and the Mafters will give them as 
much Work as they can do. And 
this would be done, by finking the 
Price of Provifions : For then Peo- 
ple would have Money to buy other 
things too. 

3. But how can the Price of 
Wheat and Barley be reduced? 

By prohibiting for ever, by mak- 
ing a full End, of that Bane of 
Health, that Deftroyer of Strength, 
of Life and of Virtue, DtftilUng. — 
C 3 Perhaps 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 27 



(,8 ) 

Perhaps this alone might go a great 
way toward anfwering rhe whole 
Defign. 'TIs not improbable, it 
would' fpeedily fink the Price of 
Corn, at leaft one Part in three. 
If any thing more were required. 
Might not all Starch be made of 
Rice, and the Importation of this, 
as well as of Corn, be incouraged? 



4. How can the Price of Oats be 
reduced ? 

By reducing the Number of Hor- 
fes. And may not this be effedu- 
ally done, (without affe(fling the 
Ploughman, the Waggoner, or any of 
thofe who keep Horfes for common 
Work;) i. By laying a Tax of 
ten Pounds, on every Horfe export- 
ed to France, for which (notwith- 
itanding an artful Paragraph in a 
late public Paper) there is as great 



28 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



( 19 ) 

a Demand as ever? 2. By laying 
an additional Tax on Gentlemen's 
Carriages : Not fo much on every 
IVheel,, (bare-faced, fhamelefe Parti- 
ality 1) but five Pounds yearly, upon 
every Horfe, And wrould not thefe 
two Taxes alone fupply near as much 
as is now paid for Leave to poifon 
his Majefty's liege Subjects ? 

5. How can the Price of Beef 
and Mutfon be reduced > 

By Increafing the Breed of Sheep 
and horned Cattle. And this would 
foon be iricreafed feven-fold, if the 
Price of Horfes was reduced ; which 
it furely would be, half in half, by 
the Method above-mentioned. 



6. How can the Price of Pork and 
Poultry be reduced ? 

Whether 



ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 29 



( 20 ) 

Whether it ever w/V/, is another 
Queftlon. — But it can be done< i. 
By letting no Farms of above an 
hundred Pounds a Year : 2. By re- 
prefTing Luxury : Whether by Laws, 
by Example; or by Both. — I had 
almofl faid, By the Grace of GOD. 
But to mention This, has been long 
out of Faihion. 

7. How may the Price of Land 
be* Tedaced ? 

By all the Methods above-named, 
as each tends to- ieffen the Expence 
of Houfe-keepiog : Bat efpecially the 
kft; by reftraining Luxury, which 
is the grand and general Source of 
Want. 

8. How may the Taxes be redu- 
ced ? 

I . By difcharging half, the Nati- 
onal Debty and fo faving by this 

fingle 



30 ABINGDON WAR-FOOD BOOK 



( 21 ) 

{ingle. Means, above two Millions 
a Year. 2. By abolilhing all ufelefs 
Penfions, as faft as ihofe who now 
enjoy them die. Efpecially thofe ri- 
diculous ones, given to. fome hun- 
dreds of idle Men, as Governors of 
Forts or Ca/iks : Which Forts have 
anfvvered no End for above thefe 
hundred Years, unlefs to fhelter 
Jackdaws and Crows.— Might not 
good part of a Million more, be fa- 
ved in this very Article ? 

But will this ever be done ? 

I fear not : At leaft. We have no 
reafon to hope for it ihortly: For 
what Good can we expe£l (fuppofe 
the Scriptures are true) for fuch a 
Nation as this ? Where there is no 
Fear of God ? Where there is luch 
a deep, avowed, thorough Contempt 
of all Relfgion^ as I never faw, never 

heard

heard or read of, in any other Na- 
tion, whether Chriftian, Mahome- 
tan or Pagan. It feems as if GOD 
mujl Ihortly arlfe, and maintain his

into the Hands of GOD^ and not into 
the Hands of Men.
