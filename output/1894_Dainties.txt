PINEAPPLE HULNAH 

Pare and remove the eyes from 
one large or two small pineapples ; 
grate, rejecting the core. Mix four 
even tablespoonfuls of cornstarch 
with half cup granulated sugar; 
now add this to the pineapple, turn 
the whole into a double boiler and 
stir constantly until boiling hot and 
thick ; add a tablespoonful of butter, 
or two of cocoanut cream, and turn 
into a fancy pudding mold. Stand 
in a cold place to harden. When 
ready to serve, turn on a pretty 
plate, heap whipped cream around, 
garnish with candied violets, and 
serve.

EAST INDIA CHARLOTTE 

Put one pint of milk into a double 
boiler. Moisten four tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch in a little cold milk, 
add this to the hot milk, cook until 
thick and smooth; add half cup of 
sugar and one cup of grated cocoa- 
nut; mix and turn into a shallow 
pan to cool. Do not have the mix- 
ture over one inch thick. When 
cold and hard, with a round cutter, 
cut the whole into cakes. Lift each 
carefully and put it on the individual 
dish on which it is to be served. 

Cover quarter box of gelatin with 

quarter cup of cold milk and soak 

ten minutes. Stand over hot water 

until dissolved, add it to one pint

of thick cream, add three-quarters 
cup of powdered sugar and tea- 
spoonful of vanilla sugar. Make 
the cream icy cold and whip it to a 
froth. Put this in a pastry bag, 
using a star tube; force it around 
the cakes, in fancy designs. Heap 
blocks of a clear, bright jelly in the 
center, and, when cold again, serve.

CREAM CHERRIES 

Put a half pound of granulated 
sugar and a half cup of water over 
the fire to boil. Stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, then boil carefully until 
you can spin a thread from the tine 
of a fork. Turn on a greased plat- 
ter and when cool (not cold), stir 
with a spoon until it granulates and 
is perfectly white. Scrape the mix- 
ture together and knead it for a mo- 
ment, then put it into a little sauce- 
pan, stand this in another of boiling 
water and stir constantly until it 
melts. If, then, you find it too 
thick, add, drop by drop, sufficient 
water to make it the right consist- 
ency. Have ready your little paper 



Dainties 

cases, or a cut-glass dish upon which 
you are going to serve the cherries. 
Select red, white and black cherries 
and allow them to remain in bunches 
on the stem. Dip, one at a time, 
carefully into the cream, which must 
be kept hot. Hold for an instant, 
and then heap gracefully on the 
plate, or, if they are single cherries, 
you may place at once in the little 
paper cases. 

All kinds of small fruit are exceed- 
ingly pretty dipped in this way.

CREAM STRAWBERRIES 

Make and melt the cream as 
directed in the preceding recipe. 
Select medium-sized ripe berries. 
Pull the hulls close to the stem, dip 
the berries down into the cream and 
then replace the hull. Put them at 
once into paper cases and stand them 
away for use, or these may also be 
heaped on a cut-glass dish. Straw- 
berries, having a soft outside cover, 
will only keep a few hours. 

Carpels of oranges, white grapes 
— in fact, all kinds of grapes — may 
be served in this way.

STUFFED DATES 

Select the rich, dark dates and 
those that are in good shape. Split 
on one side and carefully remove the 
stone. In the place of the stone put 
quarter of an English walnut. Wrap 
the date over until it looks perfect 
and arrange neatly on a pretty plate. 



CHERRIES IN JELLY 

Select one quart of ripe red cher- 
ries. Stone them carefully, saving 
all the liquor that is lost during ston- 
ing. Put three teaspoonfuls of gran- 
ulated gelatin in a half pint of cold 
water; let it soak while you are

stoning the cherries. Now add the 
cherry juice to the gelatin. Stir over 
boiling water until the gelatin is 
thoroughly dissolved, and at the 
same time put a cup of sugar over 
the cherries. As soon as the gela- 
tin has thoroughly melted strain it 
carefully over the cherries, mix and 
turn into a fancy mold. Stand away 
for two or three hours until con- 
gealed enough to hold its shape. 
This must not be stiff but just hold 
together.

COMPOTE OF PINEAPPLE 

Peel, and pick apart with a silver 
fork one good-sized, very ripe pine- 
apple. Cover three teaspoonfuls ot 
granulated gelatin with a half cup or 
cold water and soak for five min- 
utes. Cut two good-sized oranges 
into halves, carefully remove the 
seeds, and then, with a spoon, take 
out each little carpel. Mix with the 
pineapple. Turn over this, one cup 
of granulated sugar. Mix until the 
sugar is thoroughly dissolved, then 
heat the gelatin over hot water, add 
it to the pineapple and orange, and 
turn into small individual molds. 
Stand away in a cold place for at 
least two hours. Turn out and

Dainties 

serve, with whipped cream. This 
cannot stand too long, or it will 
become liquid. 



CREAM JELLY 

Put two teaspoonfuls of granu- 
lated gelatin into one pint of cream ; 
add half cup of granulated sugar 
and teaspoonful of vanilla; stand in 
a cold place for ten minutes. Then 
stir over hot water until the cream 
is sufficiently hot to dissolve the 
gelatin. Strain, and when cool, 
not thick, add four tablespoonfuls 
of sherry. Turn into small individ- 
ual molds and stand away on the 
ice. Serve icy cold.

BAVAROISE 



Cover two teaspoonfuls of gran- 
ulated gelatin with four tablespoon- 
fuls of cold water. Put one and a 
half cups of cream in a double boiler 
with a teaspoonful of vanilla sugar ; 
bring it to scalding point and then 
stand it aside for twenty minutes 
until the cream is thoroughly flavored 
with the vanilla. Add the gelatin to 
this and stir until dissolved. Now, 
mix a half cup of sugar, gradually, 
with the yolks of four eggs. Beat 
until light, add to the cream, and stir 
it over the fire in a double boiler 
until it begins to thicken. Be 
exceedingly careful not to curdle. 
Now strain this into a basin and 



Dainties 

stand it in a pan of cracked ice. 
Stir constantly until the mixture 
begins to thicken, then stir in half 
pint of cream that has been whipped 
to a stiff frothy Turn into a fancy 
mold and stand away on the ice. 
When ready to serve, dip the 
mold quickly into a pan of hot 
water. Have ready any small, fresh 
fruit — raspberries, strawberries ot 
peaches. Turn pudding out in 
the center of a plate, heap the fruit 
around the base of the pudding, 
and serve; or a border mold may 
be used, and fruit placed in the 
center.

PISTACH CREAM 

Cover two teaspoonfuls of gran- 
ulated gelatin with half cup of milk 
to soak for ten minutes. Whip one 
pint of cream, turn it into a pan and 
stand it in another of cracked ice. 
Add half cup of powdered sugar, 
four tablespoonfuls of Madeira and 
a half teaspoonful of bitter almond. 
Stand the gelatin over hot water 
until dissolved. Strain it into the 
cream and stir carefully until the 
mixture begins to thicken. Then 
turn into a fancy mold and stand 
away on the ice for two or three 
hours. Remove the hulls from two 
ounces of pistachio nuts and chop 
them very, very fine. Put them in 

21 



Dainties 

a sieve. When you are ready to 
serve the cream, dip the mold 
quickly in hot water, loosen it from 
the edge and turn it in the center of 
the serving dish. Garnish the base 
with preserved green walnuts and 
sprinkle the pistachio nuts thickly 
over the top.

RICE A L'IMPERATRICE 

Wash a half cup of rice through 
several cold waters, rubbing it well 
in the hands. Let it soak over 
night. Next morning when you are 
ready to make the dessert throw this 
rice into about one pint of boiling 
water. Stand it on the back part 
of the stove where it cannot possi- 
bly boil, and simply steam for thirty 
minutes until the rice is tender, 
white and dry. Turn it into a col- 
ander and drain away the last drop 
of moisture, then throw it on a clean 
towel or napkin, and, with your 
hands, spread it out without' break- 
ing the grains. Put three teaspoon- 
fuls of gelatin into half pint of milk 

23 



Dainties 

and let it soak for fifteen minutes. 
Put another half pint of milk, with 
two-thirds of a cup of sugar, into a 
double boiler; add the grated rind 
of one lemen and stir until the milk 
is steaming hot; add the gelatin. 
Now add the rice to this and turn 
into a basin. Stand this in another 
of cracked ice, stir continuously 
until the mixture begins to thicken, 
then add carefully and quickly one 
pint of cream that has been whipped 
to a stiff froth. Turn this mixture 
into a border mold and stand it 
away on the ice. 

If it is the strawberry season, 
have stemmed one quart of fine 
berries. Raspberries, peaches or 
pineapple may be used. The pine- 

24 



Dainties 

apple must be sugared at least a half 
hour before using. When you are 
ready to serve the pudding, turn it 
carefully on a round dish and heap 
the fruit in the center. If you have 
pineapple, pour the syrup over the 
pudding. If you wish to serve this 
in a solid mold, without fresh fruit, 
after you have turned it on the serv- 
ing dish, add a little hot water to a 
glass of either apple or quince jelly, 
and stir it over the fire until it 
becomes slightly liquid, then turn it 
into a sieve, and hold the sieve over 
the pudding, and with a spoon stir 
until the pudding is covered with 
the jelly. Serve at once.

CARAMEL CUSTARDS 

Take eight small custard cups. 
Put half cup of sugar in a saucepan 
and stir it over the fire until it melts. 
When perfectly liquid and a dark 
straw color, pour in sufficient to 
cover the bottom of each cup. Beat 
three eggs without separating ; add 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar and a 
teaspoonful of vanilla. When well 
mixed, add one and a half cups of 
milk. Beat again and turn this mix- 
ture into the cups on top of the cara- 
mel. Stand the cups in a pan of hot 
water and bake in the oven until the 
custard is set in the center. Take 
from the fire and turn out while hot. 
The better way is to turn each cus- 
26 



Dainties 

tard into a saucer on which it is to 
be served. Stand away until cold, 
and serve. 



CAKE RISSOLES 

Cut stale sponge cake into thin 
slices, then, with a round cutter, 
into cakes about two inches in diam- 
eter. Cover each with almond paste, 
put two together as you would a 
sandwich. Dip quickly in egg and 
crumbs ; fry in hot oil. Serve, with 
puree of apricots poured oven 



27 



Dainties 

COCOANUT MILK 

Purchase two fresh cocoanuts; 
grate them, put the grated cocoanut 
into a bowl and pour over one quart 
of boiling water. Allow it to stand 
until cool. Then, with your hand, 
press all the liquid out of the cocoa- 
nut. Wring the cocoanut carefully, 
a handful at a time, and put into a 
bowl. Strain the milk thus pro- 
duced through a cheese cloth and 
stand away until the cream comes 
to the surface. This will take about 
two hours. Wash the cocoanut 
with another quart of boiling 
water; proceed as before, strain and 
stand aside. Throw the cocoanut 
away.

CUCUMBER SAUCE 

This sauce is exceedingly nice 
served with either broiled, boiled or 
creamed fish. Peel and grate four 
good-sized cucumbers. Put the 
pulp in a sieve and allow the water 
to drain carefully away. Then put 
the pulp in a bowl ; add a teaspoon- 
ful of grated onion, dash of cayenne, 
half teaspoonful of salt and, if you 
have it at hand, a tablespoonful of 
chopped green pepper. Turn this 
mixture into the serving dish, add 
four tablespoonfuls of thick cocoa- 
nut cream, tablespoonful of lemon 
juice and it is ready to use.

CEYLON TOMATO SAUCE 

This is a delicious sauce to serve 
with thin, cold roasted beef or 
mutton. Select three good-sized 
solid tomatoes. Remove the skins, 
cut them into halves, press out the 
seeds and stand the tomatoes aside 
until perfectly cold. When ready 
to use, chop them fine, add half 
teaspoonful of salt, grain of red 
pepper and teaspoonful of onion 
juice or grated onion. Mix and put 
into the serving dish. Carefully 
remove the cream from the top of 
the first bowl of cocoanut milk. 
Pour four tablespoonfuls of this 
cream over the tomato ; sprinkle 
over a tablespoonful of lemon juice 

30 



Dainties 

and it is ready to serve. One table- 
spoonful of chopped green pepper, 
and one of green ginger, is an 
improvement. 



CURRIED RICE 

Wash one cup of rice through 
several cold waters, rubbing it well 
between the hands. Then throw it 
into a large kettle of boiling water 
and boil rapidly for thirty minutes. 
Strain in a colander and stand the 
colander in the oven for a few 
minutes until the rice is perfectly 
dry and white. While the rice is 
boiling put two tablespoonfuls of 
butter into a saucepan and add one 

3i 



Dainties 

onion, sliced. Stir constantly until 
the onion is a golden color, but not 
brown. Now add a level table- 
spoonful of flour. Mix carefully 
with the butter and add half pint of 
cocoanut milk. Stir until boiling, 
then add a teaspoonful of turmeric, 
teaspoonful of curry, moistened in a 
little cocoanut milk ; bring to boil- 
ing point again, and add a half 
teaspoonful of salt. Dish the rice; 
strain and curry over, and it is ready 
to serve.

CEYLON TOMATOES 

Scald and peel six solid toma- 
toes. Press out the seeds. Put the 
tomatoes into a saucepan, add a bay 
leaf, a slice of onion, clove or garlic, 
chopped fine. Now cover the 
tomatoes with the cocoanut milk. 
Moisten a teaspoonful of turmeric in 
a little cocoanut milk, add to the 
tomatoes and cover the saucepan. 
Cook slowly for fifteen minutes. 
The tomatoes must remain in perfect 
halves. Have ready the serving 
dish, heated, lift the tomatoes care- 
fully, without breaking, and put 
them on the dish. Now add to the 
sauce one tablespoonful of butter 
and one of flour rubbed together. 

33 



Dainties 

Stir until boiling ; add a teaspoonful 
of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
pepper and two teaspoonfuls of 
lemon juice. Strain this sauce over 
the tomatoes and serve. 



PUREE OF APRICOTS 

Press through a sieve twelve 
halves of apricots. Put this in a 
saucepan, adding half cup of the 
strained liquor from the can. When 
boiling, add one teaspoonful of 
arrow-root which has been mois- 
tened in a little cold water. Boil a 
moment, take from fire and add two 
tablespoonfuls of sherry. 

34 



Dainties 

RAGLETS 

Put half pint of water and two 
ounces of butter in a saucepan over 
the fire. When boiling, add four 
ounces of flour; beat until a ball of 
dough is formed. Take from fire, 
and stand aside to cool. When 
cool, add one egg, without separat- 
ing or beating; mix, add another, 
mix again, and so continue until 
you have added four eggs. Now 
beat four or five minutes. Have 
ready a deep pan of hot fat (oil pref- 
erable). Put the mixture into a 
pastry bag with star tube; press it 
out into smoking fat, making the 
ragle as nearly as possible the shape 
of small pretzel. Cook on one side, 

35 



Dainties 

then turn and cook the other. Have 
ready a dusting material made from 
a half cup of powdered sugar, one 
teaspoonful of cinnamon and one of 
vanilla sugar. Lift the raglets from 
the fat, drain a moment and then dust 
well with the mixture. These are 
very good and must be served the 
same day on which they are made.
