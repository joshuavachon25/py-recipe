PREFACE. 



Cookery has attained its present development by a long 
process of experimental empiricism, at which all mankind 
has laboured from very early days of its existence. Such 
being its origin, the only means for its transmission and 
perpetuation was apprenticeship. The earliest records of 
acquired knowledge assumed the form of unconnected 
recipes, which were mostly handed down from generation 
to generation, and even when they received greater publicity, 
and were made easier of access by the printing press, they 
preserved this character of incoherency. Their contents 
and form rose somewhat in quality with the progress of the 
art itself, and these improvements attained their highest de- 
velopment about the middle of the last century. But during 
the time which has elapsed since that special renaissance, a 
distinct retrogression in culinary literature is perceptible, as 
shown by compromises with the demand for excellence in 
all its branches, and diagnosed at once by humanists accus- 
tomed to what one of its greatest exponents has termed the 
manly and elegant style of magiric art. 

Great as has been the number of printed books which recited 
rolls of prescriptions for the preparation of food, yet amongst 
them there does not occur any systematic attempt to express 



vi PREFACE 

the acquired knowledge in the shape of general rules, such 
as would result from a codification of principles. The great 
mass of detail seems to have prevented its organization in 
the shape of a logical system, and it became, consequently, 
a matter of great difficulty to teach and use it in practical 
life with celerity and ease. 

In the present treatise it has been attempted to produce 
such a system of general rules as will enable those who 
thoroughly master them to perform the principal culinary 
operations without reference to the frequently unintelligible 
records of the details of mere empiricism. These rules are 
based in the first place upon unimpeachable scientific data 
or fundamental truths which admit of no circumvention or 
compromise, but have to be obeyed under pain of certain 
failure. This obedience has at once its ample reward in 
clearing the subject of a mass of errors and delusions which 
disfigure it as a science, and impair its utility, and in placing 
into the hands of operators the means of attaining their 
object with certainty and elegance. 

Physiological deduction proves that perfect cookery is the 
greatest economy, and that no cookery is rational which 
does not attain the utmost theoretically possible effect, 
namely, the production of the highest physiological force. 
Physicians have many opportunities for observing the effect 
of various kinds of food and different modes of preparation 
upon the several classes of society, and have not rarely to 
advise on their selection and use. By combining with this 
function the study of individualities and their possible 
idiosyncrasies they practise the art of dietetics. It is 
believed and hoped that the medical profession will find in 
ihis work many materials to assist them in dietetic dis- 
quisitions, and in the synthesis of rules to give into the 



PREFACE vii 

hands of patients or their providers. Such advice is often 
asked for, and is always well received ; and this experi- 
ence has been one of the motives for the composition of this 
treatise. 

While including special applications such as the fore- 
going, it has been the aim of the author to make the work 
general, comprehensive, and popular, and adapted to the use 
either directly or through intelligent intermediaries of all 
classes of the community. Housewives more particularly 
may find therein information which will enable them to 
guide and direct the practical operations of their household 
as far as it is concerned with what in classical English is 
called nurture, the raising up as well as maintaining sound 
physical constitutions, and the agreeable conduct of social 
relations. 

The recognition by our educators that the elementary 
principles of rational food preparation might with advantage 
be imparted to the growing generation has resulted in the 
introduction of cookery as a subject of instruction in public 
schools. The body of the actual teaching, so far as it could 
be observed, exhibited the goodwill of the teachers grappUng 
with an unwieldy subject, without their attaining such 
results as the opportunity might secure. Hitherto there has 
been no comprehensive system available which could be 
taught in classes by means of a primer, and to make up for 
this deficiency practical demonstrations so called, gleaned 
from the manner in which instruction in natural sciences 
is given, were made part of the teaching. Such practical 
classes are a beginning towards the tilling of the soil, on 
which the seed of elementary scientific generalization might 
hereafter bring growth and crop. But the oral teaching 
reflects the condition of indifferent practice, namely, the 



viii PREFACE 

want of system, with the additional disadvantage of its 
being circumscribed in scope by the erroneous presumption 
that it must be adapted to the narrowest circumstances 
only, and not include application to the wants of the 
most numerous classes. But as a knowledge of cookery is 
of general necessity, its teaching must be, even when quite 
elementary, of universal applicability. 

There is much evidence in favour of collateral advantages 
which good cookery may, and does, confer upon society, 
e.g., in preventing and counteracting the too common 
tendency to excessive consumption of alcoholic liquids. In 
relation thereto also it may be hoped that this treatise will 
contribute to the progress of hygienic knowledge and con- 
duct, and thus aid on all sides in the evolution and prac- 
tice of humanitarian principles, and in the embellishmen 
and prolongation of human existence.

CHAPTEE I. 

OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKERY. 

The Evolution of Cookery as illustrating its Present Aims 
and Objects. 

Cookery is the adaptation to the purposes of nutrition of 
natural food-products, which by themselves and in their 
original state would be either indigestible and unwholesome, 
or unattractive and injurious to man. This adaptation is 
effected by various processes of preparing, selecting and 
changing the natural products with the aid of various kinds, 
of heat, or with the assistance of several processes of fer- 
mentation, or through the agency of different admixtures. 
Those food-products will be the most suitable for being 
subjected to the processes of cooking and its auxiliaries 
which offer the best chances of tasting well, being whole- 
some, easily digested, and of great nutritive value. A great 
part of the advantageous effect of cookery consists in the 
concentration which it causes in natural more or less 
diluted and watery products. Thus, in the roasting of meat 
a great amount of water is evaporated ; a similar effect is 
produced in the production of cheese and cream, and the 
treatment of the juices and ^yulp of fruit. In the process of 
bread-making, on the other hand, water has to be added to 

1 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



the flour in order to enable the ferments contained in it to 
do their work, and the starch to become opened up and 
combined with the water to form a hydrate, in which form 
alone it is digestible to man. The effect of heat upon most 
animal and vegetable substances is to make them more 
soluble in the digestive juices ; heat, moreover, destroys 
2Kirasitical organisms capable of being transferred in a living 
state from meat to man, or to enter his body from the outer 
world in uncooked articles of food acting as mere carriers or 
vehicles, and thereby is a powerful, if not absolute, pre- 
ventive of a certain class of diseases. The changes of the 
seasons in the moderate zones involve the necessity of 
adapting the culinary preparations to them, notwithstanding 
that the art of preserving food has made such progress as 
to render several branches of culinary art almost indepen- 
dent of the seasons. Within the tropics the consideration 
of the seasons is no longer necessary. 

Adaptation of Cookery to the Conditions, Ages, and Fortunes 

of Men. 

In all latitudes cookery has to accommodate itself in an 
infinite variety of ways to the ages, conditions, and fortunes 
of men; it has to consider not only the mere nutritive 
value of its products, but also what may be termed their 
cesthetical value, which may be defined as value arising 
from the liking or disliking which various persons with cer- 
tain natural or atavistic or acquired tastes manifest towards 
certain products and preparations. There is a kind of 
cookery of the value and agreeable nature of which most 
people are convinced, and which a French writer"^ has 
described as the manly and elegant kind. It may be termed 
cosmopolitan, as it has been accepted all over the world, 
during the present century, after having taken ages for its 

* M. A. Careme, in ' Le Cuisinier Parisien, ou I'Art de la Cuisine au 
dix-neuvifeme Sifecle.' 1828, 8^ He terms it, * Le genre male et elegant.' 



OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKERY 



elaboration. It is based upon the broadest foundation of 
common food-resources, applying all which are available, 
without refusing refined delicacies or inversely attributing 
to them exaggerated importance. 

Distinction between the Nutritive and ^sthetical Value of 
Food as illustrated by ' Bread and Cake.' 

In accordance with the foregoing, we may give as the 
widest definition of the object s of cookery the preparation of 
food in such a manner that man shall derive the greatest 
nutritive and cBsthetical advantage from its cons7cmption. 
Inversely, the results of cookery demonstrate the fact of the 
arising of these advantages out of the ])ractice of cookery, 
if, indeed, these results were not originally the main agent 
in effecting its systematic development. It would be an 
interesting study to follow hypothetically the progress of 
the earliest attempts of man to modify natural food by fire. 
The earliest man must necessarily have been a carnivore, 
and have eaten the game and fish which he killed in a raw 
state. As soon as he had invented the art of making fire at 
will, accident or experiment would show him the advan- 
tages of grilling meat before the fire, particularly such as 
would require to be rescued from the frozen state. He 
would have learned quickly how to braise fish upon the 
hot ashes of a nearly extinct wood fire, without the inter- 
vention of any implement of stone or earthenware what- 
soever.* When he had advanced to the manufacture of 
earthemvare vessels, man could boil and fry his meat, and 
add thereto such vegetables and fruit as experience would 
show him to be eatable. Cereals and leguminosce, which 
palaeontologists tell us were eaten by some early men, even 
pre-Saxon inhabitants of England, in the unshelled and

Lisbon before the doors of the houses of the wage-earning class, and before 
and in the taverns frequented by labourers.

uncooked state, "^ would now be prepared by boiling, and 
having been also broken by pounding instruments, stones 
and wood-pestles, would yield the earliest massive nutritive 
material, viz., gruel, j 

Further Illustrations of Evolution. 

The development of the culinary treatment of meat on 
the one hand would lead to the discovery or invention of 
soups, stews, and sauces, while that of the treatment of 
cereals would result in bread, j&rst unleavened, afterwards 
leavened, ultimately harmed, lastly raised by chemical means 
through mineral agents in the shape of baking-powders. 
The incidents of roasting would afford opportunities for the 
study of the use and management of fat ; a similar result 
would come out of the treatment of the milh of coios, 
namely, the knowledge of producing and using butter. 
More southern men would have learned and practised the 
use of fat from the oil-yielding seeds, such as nuts, almonds, 
poppy-seeds, and particularly olives. To these main sup- 
porters of life the use of green vegetables, of roots, rhizomes, 
bulbs, sp'outs, and siveet or aromatic fruit could only have 
been added very gradually, as they required to be educed 
from their original so-called wild condition by horticultural 
art — an art which presupposes stability of society and of 
property, and was never practised by either pastoral nomads 
or the huntsmen of the archaic forests. The discovery of 
zests and s;pices was one of the latest acquisitions of culinary 
science, and presupposed a great development of trade both 
by land and sea. The earliest universal sweet princijjle of 
food was honey ; while siigar from plants, particularly from 
the sugar-cane, was an expensive curiosity yet in Eoman 
imperial times, and did not become a staple article of trade

tempted to be explained by this practice.

and of culinary practice until long after the discovery and 
conquest of America. Fermented drinks were the natural 
outcome of sweet juices from fruit, apples, grapes, and 
others, or from exotic plants, such as the sugar-cane, or the 
maple, or the toddy-palm, or the Mexican agave. Fermented 
drinks from malted cereals were probably discovered later, 
but have been known to all cereal-cultivating nations at all 
times of which we have any historical record. A fermented 
drink from mare's milk, the Kicmijs of the Kirgese of the 
Asiatic steppes, was described by the father of history, 
Herodotus, and remains a typical Kirgese product to this 
day. The manner in which many culinary processes are 
interlaced with processes for the production of stimulants 
or alcoholic intoxicants is illustrated by the fact that the 
same yeast which produces beer, wine and spirit ferments 
the bread made from cereals. 

Confectionery as a Measure of Culture. 

The few aphoristic hints contained in the foregoing para- 
graphs will suffice to direct the attention of the reader to 
the fact that the objects and results of cookery will be best 
understood by the light of its history. This we cannot pre- 
sume to treat systematically, but we will endeavour to give 
to our sympathizers such a short guide to the historical litera- 
ture of cookery that they will be enabled to follow any part 
of the subject by means of special study. The history of 
human culture, or that kind of development which passes 
under the unsuitable name of civilization, includes the 
history of the science of food-preparation ; and this branch 
affords sometimes interesting solutions of doubts, which no 
other kind of history can solve. 

We have proposed as a hypothesis, arising out of the 
results of our culinary studies, that the state of culture of 
every nation could be estimated comparatively hy its con- 
fectionery, even when we knew httle of its cookery, for 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



confectionery is the most advanced and refined part of 
cookery, and thus enables the expert to draw a conclusion 
backwards i-egarding the kind of cookery out of which it 
originated. Applying this hypothetical test, e.cj., to the 
natives of India, we had to admit that they possessed no 
proofs of ancient civilization ; even currij and mulligatunny 
owe their quality to English skill of adaptation, while the 
purely Indian confections — that is to say, preparations con- 
sidered by Indian natives in the same light as that in which 
we consider macroons and meringues — are neither skilful in 
their execution nor attractive in their taste.* 

Qualifications for Authorship in Cookery. 

The Latin work of Apicius on the art of cookery is 
perhaps sufficient proof that a man may be an., actual 
gastronomer, and yet be unable to compose even an intel- 
ligible work on his favourite subject. We have hazarded 
the surmise that the absurdities contained in the work were, 
perhaps, in part, later corruptions ; but these also must 
have been added by persons conversant with practice, and 
therefore help to prove the general proposition that mere 
practical acquaintance with cookery, maybe of a very high 
degree, does not by itself constitute a qualification for even 
limited authorship. Cooks did, and do now, mostly rise 
from the ranks of operatives, and have little or no oppor- 
tunity for developing literary acquirements. They rise by 
personal operative skill or handicraft, more or less aided 
by personal address and appearance. Of course they study 
culinary works for particular purposes, and are in posses- 

* The so-called confectioneries made by native Hindoos in the Indian 
and ColoniMl Exhibition in London were either indifferent to flatness, or 
simply re| vilsive. We believe even these were deteriorated JMtiS'fulmaii 
importations from Turkey, and by no means Hindoo inventions; but the 
drawn sugar (sugar snow) had neither the white beauty nor the excellent 
taste of the Turkish ' Ketven helvassy,' and the stalactite-like pipes made 
of pyrup and starch, resembling bullose macaroni, baked in foetid oil, no 
amount of enthusiasm could find attractive, or even consumable.

sion of the keys to practical solutions which they have 
obtained from their masters, and which were more fre- 
quently preserved as secrets than proclaimed for general 
use. But even when we scrutinize these keys, manuscript 
collections of recipes, or their elaborate forms in works on 
cookery which have been under the correcting, or, at all 
events, grammatically modifying, influence of literary skill, 
we find them displaying a great number of shortcomings, 
mainly arising from the want of the knowledge of scientific 
principles. Of this the completely erroneous notions about 
hones, and their influence in the production of broth are the 
most universal proof. These errors were never discovered, 
never even dreamt of by cooks ; maintained by housewives 
with rare pertinacity; upheld in all cookery-books with 
concerted fallacy, and practised in the smallest kitchens as 
well as the richest and highest ones in all lands. It re- 
quired a scientific physician and chemist to dispel such 
deleterious notions, and put in their place a correct scien- 
tific knowledge of the principles which guide the production 
of savour, and of the materials which are its foundation. 
The history of this error illustrates in a striking manner 
that part of the first aphorism of Hippocrates which 
enunciates that experience is fallacious and judgment 
difficult. 

Some have supposed that women were particularly 
qualified to become authoresses of works on cookery. This 
conception was so prevalent in the last century that a 
medical practitioner, a Dr. Hill, is reported to have pub- 
lished a work of his own under the assumed name of 
' Hannah Glasse.'"^ This practice was followed in other 

* The question of the authorship of Mrs. Glasse's ' Art of Cookery ' 
has been discussed in the columns of the Times, September 17-21, 1891, 
by Mr. W. F. Waller and Mr. G. A. Sala. Someone had alleged that 
the popularly known opening or preamble of a fabulous receipt for cooking 
a hare was to be found in Mrs. Glasse's work ; others endeavoured to 
explain the humour by a misprint imputed to the same work, whereby

countries as long as male cooks had not obtained the pre- 
ponderance in the higher realms of culinary practice which 
they at present enjoy. The works actually written by 
women can be recognised at once by the style, the subjects, 
and their treatment, and a general character which botanists 
when diagnosing plants term the Jiabitus, and which it 
would take a long analysis to define, but which once 
known is immediately evident without detailed scrutiny. 
Dr. Johnson, the lexicographer, once discussed this subject 
in a characteristic manner, when he had in conversation pro- 
posed to write a book about cookery ' on philosophical prin- 
ciples.' The information which he then received, that Mrs. 
Glasse's ' Art of Cookery,' which was much used and spoken 
of at that time, had been written by a physician, helped 
him to accentuate his thesis that the subject of cookery was 
best treated by a philosopher, and he added that his inter- 
locutors should see what a book of cookery he would make. 
Thereupon a lady said, * That would be Hercules with the 
distaff indeed.' Whereupon Johnson replied, ' No, madam, 
women can spin very well, but they cannot make a good 

' First case your hare ' had been changed into ' First catch your hare.' 
Mr. Waller showed that neither of these passages occurred in ' The Art of 
Cookery,' and ascribed the work to Aaron Hill, a writer who lived in the 
first part of last century. Mr. Sala, on the other hand, supported the 
authorship of 'Mrs. Hannah Glasse, habit-maker to the Royal Family,' 
and showed that the 'Hill,' to whom the authorship had been ascribed, as 
above stated, was not Aaron Hill, as assumed by Mr. Waller, but John 
Hill, as alleged in Boswell's 'Life of Johnson' (vol. iii., p. 311). Mr. 
Sala's criticisms do not affect the historical sources of the allegation that 
Dr. Hill was the author, 'Hannah Glasse ' the nom de plume assumed by 
him, namely the work of Boswell and the ' Memoirs of Cumberland ' (4to., 
London, 1806, p. 259). Mr. Sala mentions a recipe from a cookery-book, 
written by ' an ingenuous Gaul ' in the middle of the seventeenth century, 
which begins with what he terms 'a culinary truism,' since changed into 
'proverbial platitude,' namely the words : ' Poiir faire un ciret preiiez nn 
lievre.' This is really only a culinary commonplace, and the imperative 
of prendre has not the catch 'mfi meaning apparently attached to it by 
Mr. Sala. The humorous direction to first catch your hare is not of 
magiric origin, but is a secondary application of a humorous exposition of 
absolute conditions in other relations. Thus, ' The Niirnberg citizens do not 
hang any one, except they have caught him first.'

book on cookery.' He might have added with emphasis 
that women can cook very well, and ought to do so, and 
actually do so all over the world, but that the greatest 
amount of practice is not capable by itself to produce the 
truly philosophical qualifications which are essential to 
effectual authorship. A collection of recipes, even such as 
that of Cato of Utica, has no philosophical character, 
however meritorious it may be as a means of conservation, 
and however useful it may be in the limited circles to which 
it appeals. 

In the chapter on the historical literature of cookery will 
be found the names of two ladies who were authoresses of 
renowned treatises on cooking, one being Anna Wecker, 
nte Keller, the accomplished wife of the physician Wecker 
at Bale (1596) ; the other Maria Sophia Schellhammer, me 
Conring (about 1700). These distinguished examples prove 
the general proposition, for while these authoresses were 
original in the collection of the materials, they wisely 
accepted the guidance of their husbands in those parts 
which tended towards an inception of a philosophical treat- 
ment of the subject. 

Physicians as Authors on Cookery. 

A great number of treatises on cookery, and amongst 
them the best, have been written hy physicians. Thus, the 
Italian Baptist Fiera published in 1490, therefore shortly 
before the discovery of America, the treatise quoted below, 
* On Dinner and Diet.' His forerunner (1471) Baptista 
Massa was a physician at Ferrara. In a number of trea- 
tises we easily distinguish the medical author, whether he 
be described as such or not. Sir Kenelm Digby"'' wrote 
'The Closet of Cookery,' London, 1669; Sir Theodore 

* Sir Kenelm Digby, Knight, of Gothurst, Bucks, 1603-65, wrote also 
' MedicinaExperimentalis : Select Philosophical Secrets and Chymical Ex- 
periments,' 1672 ; 'Receipts in Physic and Surgery,' etc. (ex Graesse, 'Hist, 
of Literature,' vi., 365, 366). 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Mayerne* a treatise entitled 'Archimagirus,' which is now 
very rare, t Professor Eichard Bradley :|: was also an author 
on culinary subjects ; Dr. John Hill has, as we have already 
stated above, been credited with having been the author of 
'Mrs. Glasse's' 'Cookery.' Towards the end of the eighteenth 
century we have yet Dr. Pegge's republication of the 
ancient (1390) treatise entitled ' Forme of Cury ' (London, 
1780) ; while early in our century Dr. Hunter ' edited,' as 
he called it, a work by an author disguised as 'Ignotus,' 
entitled ' Culina Famulatrix Medicinae.' Later authors 
have ascribed this work to Dr. Hunter himself ; the medical 
observations appended to many receipts are calculated to 
support this conjecture. In 1833 was published the last 
culinary work by a medical author, Dr. Kitchiner's * Cook's 
Oracle and Housekeeper's Manual,' one of the most learned, 
philosophical, and practical treatises on cookery ever com- 
posed. We cannot tarry here to sum up the merits of 
physicians of all times about the selection of a proper diet 
for the healthy as well as the sick, as this would become a 
chapter of dietetics, to which branch of science a work on 
cookery is only as a forerunner, though an essential basis. 
Many physicians since the time of the school of Salerno 
discoursed learnedly on cookery ; thus the Dutch Professor 
Boerhaave, who was particularly qualified by his chemical 

* Theodor Turquet de Mayerne, of Geneva, 1573 to 166.'), was Professor 
of Chemistry and Physics at Paris, a Paracelsist ; the faculty had for- 
bidden (about 1566) the use of antimony in medicine ; but he, disobeying, 
was dismissed from his professorship and interdicted the practice of 
medicine. He went to England and became physician to the Court. The 
work ascribed to him is entitled 'Archimagirus.' Jeaflfreson, ii. 60,

name. Graesse, vi. 664, reports the publication by Mayerne of 'Opera

knowledge, even invented a method of preserving fish in 
wine, in which preservation it could be boiled immediately ; 
this led to the general adoption of the various liquids called 
court-houillon, which for many lustra had to fill the office 
of the true savoury broths in which fish is now boiled. In 
later times the discussions mostly turned towards the 
dietetics of food and nutrition, and thus became physio- 
logical in a special sense, while the art of preparing food 
was left to technical culinary writers. The art of adapting 
cookery to the wants of sich and delicate persons was, we 
believe, systematically treated for the first time by Walter 
Eyff in 1569 ; either in consequence of this publication, or 
as part of a general movement, it was treated in 1570 by 
Scappi, the cook of Pope Paul V., at considerable length; 
he gave two hundred receipts for cooking food for the sick 
and convalescent, and informed his pupil, for whose 
instruction he says that his book was written, that he 
would fail in his duty were he not to do so. He con- 
sequently describes how broths, soups, jellies, barley-water, 
and such things should be made. He specially recommends 
light soups made of oysters, snails, frogs, tortoises, and 
turtles. In later periods this part of the culinary art was 
discussed less and less by professional culinary writers, but 
treated mainly eclectically in appendices to other works, 
even in our own time, mostly by members of the medical 
profession. 

Acquirements necessary for Authorship. 

A person who would write a philosophical and practical 
treatise on cookery should in the first place have an ex- 
tensive practical acquaintance ivith culinary processes, with- 
out being a professional cook in any sense ; this practical 
acquaintance should be of that kind which in French 
technical schools is imparted to young men who aspire to 
become employers of technical labour, and not by any 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



means operative artisans. This will enable him to judge 
of jjrocesses, their principles and results, and of materials 
and their adaptation to processes. He should next have a 
good knowledge of i^liysics and chemistry, to be able to 
define accurately the metamorphoses efi'ected by cookery, 
and to transform empirical traditions into rules emanating 
from understood principles. He should further possess a 
good knowledge of the historical literature of cookery of all 
times, as this alone will enable him to comprehend the 
gradual evolution of the art and the difficulties through 
which it has progressed to its present high development. 
For this an extensive acquaintance with languages, both 
ancient and modern, is essential. He should further know 
practically, by study amongst the people of many lands, 
not only the so-called national dishes, but all peculiar food- 
preparations from the most humble upwards to the most 
accomplished, and should aid this knowledge by an ex- 
tensive acquaintance with the general literature in which 
the state of the culture of different nations and different 
periods is recorded. He ought to make a very deep, and 
withal very critical, study of his predecessors on the 
culinary field, without' the least pharisaical bias, but with 
the firm intention of acquiring on the one hand all the 
available information, while on the other hand eliminating 
errors arising from ignorance or vanity ; for the literature 
of cookery is remarkable for the conservatism not only of 
what is good and absolutely established, but also the 
pertinacity with which it retains a great bulk of useless 
dross, which has to be sifted out, as we have already 
shown above. Dr. Kitchiner read or consulted upwards 
of one hundred and eighty works for the purposes of his 
* Oracle,' and to these larbours next to his genius the 
great value of his work is due. How little his practice has 
been followed by later authors is evident from the fact that 
most of them misspell his name, while many of them distort, 



OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKERY 13 



while copying his suppose'-d recipes from distorted tran- 
scripts, by omission as well as interpolation. Criticism 
must be extended even to small things whenever they are 
erroneously stated ; thus, we find in two of the best 
practical works, one French, the other English, tendrons, 
the rib-cartilages of calves, persistently called teiidojis, 
which are sinews. This lapse, originally produced by 
Beauvilliers, and copied from him and his copyists for 
near a century, and similar accidents, show that philo- 
sophical culture was not one of the qualifications of the 
otherwise highly - meritorious, and by ourselves highly- 
esteemed, authors. 

Illustration derived from the Case of Cardons. 

How difficult it is even for a ijliilosoi^her to find correct 
interpretations of historical literary data we can see, e.g., 
from the following passage of an essay on * Eenaissance 
Cookery ' by Sir H. Layard : * Amongst vegetables the thistle 
(cardo) was esteemed a delicacy, and was generally served 
with fruit at the end of the dinner. The thorny thistles 
with well-grown white stalks are the best. The cardo 
includes the artichoke, but that the name usually applied 
to the common thistle is shown by the quaint remark of 
Eomoli,"^ in his " Singolare Dottrina," that it should not be 
eaten with milk, which it has the property of curdling, and 
consequently the process would take place in your stomach ; 
but it should be eaten with pepper, which does not generate 
wind, and clears the liver ; and such is the reason why 
donkeys, who eat largely of thistles, have better stomachs 
than men.' 

Now, Cardo, or Cardo di Maria, or Cardo Mariano, is the 
Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish name of the Carduus 
{Cnicus) marianus, L. Of this plant only the young tender

leaves, deprived of their spiny borders, are edible in some parts 
of the South. But this plant is not referred to in the above 
quotation ; what is meant is the hind of artichoke termed 
cardon in French, and Cynara carduncukis by Linne. Of 
this plant, which is cultivated in gardens in the South, the 
leaves are artificially etiolated, and of these the large and 
thick petioles are eaten under the name of cardons : they 
have to be cooked with broth, and constitute an agreeable 
vegetable dish of small nutritive value ; the edible variety 
is mostly free from spines, but the presence of spines does 
not prevent its becoming edible, as they are removed before 
cooking. There is, therefore, here no question of any 
thistle, and it is not likely that cooked cardons should have 
been served with fruit at the end of the dinner ; i.e., for 
dessert. The very words 2uhite stalks show that the 
etiolated or (by exclusion of light) blanched stalks are 
meant, and by no means any part of the common thistle, 
whatever species of thistle may be hinted at by that ex- 
pression. From this it follows that the * quaint ' remark of 
Eomoli is the result of a complete misapprehension. The 
statement that the cardo had the property of curdling milk 
is transferred from the flowers of the true artichoke, Cynara 
scolynus, L., of which we know from Aristotle, what is also 
known in Eastern and Southern Europe popularly, that it 
has the power of curdling milk and transforming it into 
yourt. The rest of Eomoli's remark is certainly not only a 
singular doctrine, but a farrago of ignorant nonsense. All 
milk curdles in the stomach, consequently the exclusion of 
cardos from a meal of milk would be quite useless, and the 
statement that donkeys had better stomachs than men 
because they ate thistles, though without pepper, if it 
cannot be interpreted as an abortive attempt at humour, 
is such as to preclude all further discussion.

Illustration derived from the Case of Kumys. 

I have elsewhere"^ shown how the learned English trans- 
lator of Herodotus, V. Beloe, came to a totally erroneous 
conclusion regarding that passage in the great traveller's 
work which refers to the treatment of mare's milk by 
the Scythians. * When the milk is drawn [in the manner 
previously described by Herodotus], they pour it into deep 
wooden vessels, and order the slaves to agitate it incessantly. 
That part of the milk which remains above is the most 
valued, that which is deposited is less esteemed. It is 
this which causes the Scythians to destroy the eyes of all 
their prisoners, for they do not cultivate the soil and lead 
a nomadic life.' To this passage Beloe adds the observa- 
tion : * It is clear that Herodotus here describes the making 
of butter, although he knew no word for the product.' Now, 
mare's milk is quite unsuitable for the production of butter ; 
firstly, because it contains but little fat ; and secondly, 
because the fat which can be obtained from it is not butter, 
but a half-oily, lardhke, bad-tasting substance. Further, 
the mere making of butter would not be a sufficient reason 
for blinding slaves. If, however, we assume that the de- 
scription of Herodotus applied to the making of kumys, all 
difficulties are removed ; kumys must be constantly beaten 
and stirred for long hours ; for this blind slaves could be 
used. The upper part of kumys is the alcoholic solution, 
the lower contains the curdled caseine, w^hich can serve 
more as a nutriment than as intoxicant. As far as I know, 
the nomads of the Kussian steppes do not prepare any 
butter even in the present time, but make large quantities 
of kumys. 

Example of the French ' Bain-marie.' 

We have given two cases of misapprehension on the 
part of philosophers, one concerning a substance from the 

* In my German work, ' Grundziige der anatomischen und klinischen 
Ohemie,' Berlin, 1886.

vegetable, the other a food-product from the animal king- 
dom. They illustrate the difficulty of "obtaining the 
necessary qualifications for authorship on food and cookery, 
even on the part of learned and scientifically-trained men ; 
a fortiori, how much greater must be these difficulties on 
the part of persons not so trained and circumstanced ! And 
this we find actually to be the case. Cookery-books swarm 
with errors engendered by the absence of scientific training, 
and this deficiency is manifest not only in che reciting of 
prescriptions, but extends in some cases down to the very 
pots and pans in daily use in every good kitchen ; thus 
an otherwise excellent writer actually does not know the 
definition of a water-bath, or, as the French term it, a 
bain-marie, and persistently signalizes with that name the 
saucejKins intended to stand in the bain-marie, whether 
they be in or out of water. 

Example of the German ' Kraft Briihen.' 

One of the principal qualifications for authorship in 
cookery consists in the knoiuledge of the culinary icants and 
practices of all manners and conditions of men^ so that the 
rules of food-preparation to be derived from principles and 
exemplified by recipes may be capable of application to high 
and low conditions. We have endeavoured to conform to 
that demand as regards general rules, but if we had to give 
elaborate prescriptions, we would have to oppose a practice 
according to which recipes are composed for the purpose 
not of being executed in the kitchen, but for giving to their 
authors * a false air of magnificence ' in the eyes of all those 
numerous members of society who have not sufficient ex- 
perience to find out the deception. The cookery-book -of a 
late German authoress, collected as much of it was from 
the private records of old and wealthy families, neverthe- 
less contained a number of such artefacts which remind 
somewhat of the few recipes of the French Grimod de la

Eeyniere, but possess no trace of the refinement which 
their patron of the ' Almanach des Gourmands ' had at 
least in view. Most . q2iond am housekeepers who have in 
later life become domestic encyclopaedists endeavour to 
achieve the excelsior by mere additions of materials. They 
cannot write orthographically or grammatically,* and leave 
to the printers' reader the task of correcting their spelling, 
at least in part ; but no benevolent adviser weeds out the 
incongruous materials from recipes which were never really 
compounded anywhere, but invented at the writing-table 
for the astonishment of the poor cooks and housewives who 
could not bring together so many costly materials on so 
liberal a scale as that which sprang from the authoresses' 
unbridled and cheap imagination. The dogmatic manner 
in which some of the modern authoresses spoke of decoction 
of cow-beef as Kraft Brilhen, or power-giving broths, did not 
deceive either physiologists or kitcheners, and even those 
who overlooked the ungrammatical diction for the supposed 
practical wisdom which might perchance have been collected 
from aristocratic or even royal kitchens, had to admit that 
the possible good to be obtained from the recommendations 
of these Kraft Briilien was overpowered by that hypocrisy, 
which defaces not a small number of French and German 
culinary publications. Happily we know not a single example 
of this intellectual aberration in British culinary literature, 
and we therefore need not follow the subject any further. 

The Delusion of Economical Cookery with ' Scraps costing 

Nothing.' 
We are differently affected by culinary works which pro- 
fess to teach what they term economical practices, particularly 

* Mary Smith, in her ' Complete Housekeeper,' 1772, 8vo., pp. 105 and 
247, gave Sauce-Robert as 'Roe-Boat-Sauce,' an Omelette as 'A Hamlet, 
and Queenly Soup as ' Soupe a la Rain ' (ex Kitchiner, p. 311, foot-note). 
Simpson, pp. 98 and 180, called Julienne Soup ' Soup Julian,' etc. The 
style of some modern German culinary works is very vulgar, and dis- 
figured by barbarisms of French technical words provided with German 
endings.

by French methods. We hke the effort, but decHne the 
argument by which it is ushered in. It professes to arise 
from a wish to put a check on what they term the fearful 
waste in English kitchens. Of course this does not mean 
waste in the kitchens of the wealthy, but in the establish- 
ments of those who have reason to avoid waste of every 
kind. And when we proceed to investigate the items of the 
alleged waste, we find them to consist of stale lumps of 
bread, bacon-rind, and bare bones of boiled or roast joints. 
It is seventy years since Louis Proust proved by scientific 
inquiry that bones contribute nothing useful to bouillon, 
and he concluded his argument with the exclamation, ' Voila 
com me les os font du bouillon ' ! And here they are again 
like the ever-returning Crispinus. We shall below prove at 
length, after Proust, the complete fallacy of the proposition 
that bones could either make or help to make such a 
liquid as could have any value in cookery. We shall prove 
that the boiling of bones as contemplated by the so-called 
economists is neither economical, nor typically French, nor 
based on sound doctrine in any sense. This is by no means 
equivalent to flogging a, dead horse, when it is considered 
that this lamenting about alleged English extravagance, 
and praising of alleged French thrift, has become a standing 
exercise of aspirants to culinary authorship, so that even a 
prominent medical journal could publish the following : 
* The French cook makes excellent and nutritious soup out 
of materials which the English housewife throws away as 
useless ; while her ijot-au-feu is composed of stray scraps 
carefully husbanded, which cost her nothing, but which, 
when skilfully combined, constitute a useful and inexpen- 
sive food.' 

This is the acme of misrepresentation of economical 
French cookery — loot-aii^feu of stray scraps, costing 
nothing. Such cookery of scraps is not only not feasible, 
but its allegation is merely degrading. Even the simplest 



OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKERY 19 

cookery, and all cookery whatsoever, requires in the first 
place sound materials, costing money, and such only are 
worth the trouble of cooking and expense of the fire ; 
' scraps ' are accidents to be taken care of, no doubt, but 
the very last objects on which to bestow either expense or 
labour, or on which to waste words in cookery-books or 
elsewhere. 

Let no one think that the danger of these errors is small, 
for now they have crept into public schools, and are taught 
systematically. I quote from an article ' On Housekeeping 
Schools,' by Mrs., now Lady, Priestley, in No. 188 of the 
Nineteenth Century Bevieic, October, 1892, p. 659, the 
following experience : 

' Being curious to know how simple cookery was taught 
in our Board Schools, I dropped in upon a demonstration 
class one day, and found the making of " potato-soup " and 
"how to heat up cold meat" on the programme of the 
day. A girl was singled out to say how potato-soup should 
be made. The answer was : 

* " You must chop up your bones, or cut up your meat, to 
draw out the nutriment." 

' Mistress : " Surely there's a better word than nutriment, 
isn't there?" 

* Girls : " Yes, mistress." And up went all hands. 
' Mistress : " What is it, then?" 

' Flavour said one, nourishment ventured another. No 
one was right, the appropriate word could not be found, and 
as the situation was becoming embarrassing the mistress 
had to give the cue, spelling out slowly '' G-o-o-d " 

' *' Goodness !" shouted the class triumphantly. 

* " Yes, goodness ; to draw the goodness out of the bones, 
that's an easier word, isn't it?" 

* '' Yes, mistress." 

* ** Well, then, we chop up our bones to draw the " 

* ** Goodness out," echoed the class. 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



' Taking up the notebook of the girl sitting next to me, I 
found the following entry : 

' " To make soupe chop up your bones, or cut up your 
meat to get the mintriment into it." ' 

Who will teach the teachers -themselves? 

Faire sourire le Pot-au-feu. 

The French people know better than to attempt to make 
a pot-au-feu with scraps which cost nothing ; to make this 
saucepan smile, faire sourire le pot-au-feu, it is requisite to 
put a good piece of meat into it ; this is the true explanation 
of the metaphor, though it is not contained in any dictionary; 
even Dumas has not apprehended the genius of his country- 
men, when he says that faire sourire the national cook- 
ing vessel meant to keep it boiling slowly for seven hours ; 
here also the philosophical appreciation of a truly poetical 
expression has been wanting, and good sense been sent a-beg- 
ging. At the same time, Dumas retains all the prejudices and 
errors concerning bones which we have touched upon already 
in the foregoing. And yet in absolute contradiction to this 
he proves in detail that bouillon derives its savour solely 
from meat.''' In this case also the existence of such glaring 
contradiction is made possible only by the want of guiding 
scientific principles.

SKETCH OF THE HISTORIC LITERATURE OF

Different Interpretations of Ancient Writers. 
To collect an intelligible account of the cooking of the 
ancients from the classics of antiquity is a very difficult task, 
because many passages of the texts are liable to widely

different interpretations. Thus, Eumohr"^ quotes, as a proof 
of the deterioration and downfall of Eoman cookery, and of 
its tendency to lose sight of the natural destination of eat- 
able things, the passage from Horace f given below; but to 
our mind this passage proves nothing of the kind. Even 
supposing, with Rumohr, that the fish alluded to in this 
passage, the sea-barbel, had been reduced to a mince, or to 
a pounded and sifted paste, such as we know in our days as 
puree, or potted meat, and had been served as such in single 
fricandelles or poached quenelles, this would prove to our 
mind as little a downward tendency of cookery as the use 
of potted meat and fish, e.^., potted bloater or chicken and 
ham, is proof of any decay in our days. That the fish was 
not always served in its natural shape follows from a 
passage in Apicius ;± but a passage in Seneca, § less open to 
doubt than that from Horace, seems absolutely to oppose 
the interpretation of Rumohr. 

Roman and Greek Culinary Writers. 

When the work ascribed to Apicius j] was written, the 
art of cookery must have been greatly developed. But it is 

* Rumohr, Count, ' Geist der Kochkunst,' p. 3. 

t Horace, Sat., ii. 2, 341 : 

' Laudas, insane, trilibrem 
Mullum, in dngula quem minuas i^ulmenta necesse est.' 

Now, according to Rumohr, singula pulmenta would mean separate 
dishes, separately prepared ; but according to Georges, Diet. Lat., 
singula pulmenta are single pieces, carved portions of the served fish 
v?hich each guest receives. Georges quotes just this passage from Horace 
(Sat., ii. 2, 341). ... 

J Apicius, lib. ix., cap. xiii. (de mullo) : ' et si volueris in formella 
piscem formabis.' 

§ Seneca, Epist. 95, ' torti distractique sine ullis ossibus mulli.' This 
seems an accurate description of rolled fillets of barbel, and may have been 
a very accomplished and by no means over-dressed dish.

dimentis, s. arte ciquinaria.' Many editions, a good one by Mart. Lister, 
Amstelodam., 1709. Lister believes the author to have been an African 
who compiled his work from different Greek, Roman, and African authors, 
and whose name was Caelius or Csecilius, and who gave to his book the 
title Apicius, in the same manner as Cicero entitled his work ' De

impossible to read many of the prescriptions in this work 
without coming to the conclusion that -they are, indeed, 
absurd recipes for mixtures in which the natural ingredients 
of food were so comminuted, confounded, and overlaid with 
flavours and spices, that the whole could not by any means 
produce a pleasant impression on the palate or be whole- 
some for the stomach. We therefore decline to believe 
that an artist, such as the writer of the body of the work of 
Apicius evidently was, could also have been the author of 
such enormities as are contained in the work attributed to 
him. We hold all such passages to be corruptions partly 
by omission, partly by later additions effected by ignorant 
persons, principally copying clerks ; in particular, it appears 
to us that many prescriptions are alternatives which have 
been clumsily strung together as if they were parts of a 
single process. We think it probable that an analysis and 
expurgation of the text of Apicius, by the light of this hypo- 
thesis, would result in a much better knowledge of antique 
cookery than that which is available at the present time. 

In connection with this it should be remembered that 
there lived at Eome at different periods three persons of the 
name of Apicius whom fame connects with cookery : one 
under the republic at the time of Sylla; the second one 
under Augustus and Tiberius ; the third under Trajan. 
The observations made by Seneca, Pliny, Juvenal, and 
Martial refer to the second Apicius, surnamed Marcus 
Gabius ; to this gastronomer Tiberius sent the turbot of 
Capri, which he was not rich enough, he said, himself to 
buy. This man possessed a property of two million pounds 
sterling in value : of this he squandered four-fifths upon his

of this discussion in Graesse, ' Liter. Gesehichte,' vol. i., p. 1201. 
(Jp^onhim or obsoninm, from the Greek, is everything eaten with bread, 
such as vegetables, meat, and fish. Horace uses ohsonia for dishes of fish

dinner.

extravagant table ; he then had a balance-sheet made, and 
finding the remains of his fortune insufficient to maintain 
his extravagance at the accustomed rate, he committed 
suicide by opening his veins and bleeding to death in his 
bath. To this man some have ascribed the book bearing 
the title * De re Culinaria. ' But the learned Lister believes 
a much later v^riter of the name of Coelius to have been the 
author of this treatise. Experiments* which were made at 
various periods to practically cook according to Apicius 
failed for a series of reasons : firstly, the prescriptions were 
followed without previous purification ; and secondly, the 
preparations described by a single word, such as Uquamen, 
were not at hand, because they were not understood ; and 
thirdly, some ingredients which the Eomans used, such as 
asafmtida, were used in excess or omitted. 

The cookery of i^thenaeusf is likened by himself to the 
simplicity of Homeric times, and rated far below that of 
Apicius, as he knew it. He baked onions in hot ashes, just 
as we bake them in the oven. His times and all subsequent 
centuries of Itahan cookery upheld the endeavour of Apicius 
to maintain the shape and colour of vegetables as far aa 
possible ; the colour of green vegetables, in particular, they 
were most anxious to preserve, or even to improve ; and 
this craze surviving to our time, though happily not prevail- 
ing in England, has seized the French, and caused them to 
impregnate their fresh and tinned green vegetables with 
copper.

the latter end of the republic, and in the first centuries of

imperial rule, to fill cellar, larder, and kitchen with all the 
delicacies of the known earth, particularly the establish- 
ment of fish reservoirs {'piscina,'^), must have been accom- 
panied with an adequate expansion and rise of the art of 
cooking. Unfortunately, the attention of the authors of 
those times was mainly directed to extravagances, and 
not to the actual practice of the prudent householder. 
We shall quote some recipes from early and late authors, 
from Cato of Utica to Athenseus ; but they do not enable us 
to obtain a judgment of the true preparation of good and 
elegant dishes which were current in those times. 

Authors during and since the Renaissance. 

The culinary literature of the modern culture world 
begins with the Eenaissance in the fifteenth century. The 
Italians transferred or extended their artistic striving to the 
table ; the dishes were to be not only of good taste, but also 
of artistic appearance ; and towards the attainment of this 
object painters and sculptors contributed mostly themselves 
by their elaborate artists' dinners.! Jellies were decorated 
with coloured heraldic designs by men of the brush, and 
this led sometimes to indigestions and poisonings, such as 
those which occurred to the ambassadors of Pius II. at 
Siena. J The aesthetical refinement of the older Italian 
cookery migrated with the princesses of the house of Medici 
to the Court of France. It was a part of the artistic taste of 
the time, the transplantation of which succeeded, while that 
of the Italico- Spanish poetry perished in vain imitations. The

THE HISTORIC IITERATURE OF COOKERY 25 

Italian art of cooking travelled early into Germany, Rumohr 
supposes by way of France, but the importation was direct, 
as is testified by the cookery-books which were published in 
Germany in the second half of the sixteenth century. The 
condition of Italian cookery is beautifully represented in 
the work of a man who united learning with much fateful 
experience and the epicurean principle of life, that there 
might be pleasures which could be enjoyed with perfect 
honesty or virtue — Bartholomeo Sacchi."^ He was born in 
1421 at Piadena, in the district of Cremona, and hence sur- 
named with the Latinized Platina. After he had been a 
soldier for some time he turned to the sciences, and, finding 
a patron in Cardinal Bessarion, was appointed an abbre- 
viator to Pope Pius II. Accused under the papacy of 
Paul II. of participation in a conspiracy against this poten- 
tate, he was thrown into prison, but, after long detention, 
released by Sixtus IV. This Pope made Sacchi, in 1457, 
Superintendent of the Vatican Library, in which office he 
remained up to his death in 1480. Together with Pom- 
ponius Lgetus he founded a learned society. 

Of works of this period published in Germany we have to 
mention that of Hans Folzt ; further, the anonymous 
treatise entitled * Kiichenmeisterey,' and a Netherlandish 
work in the Dutch language.!

who lived at Mantua, and is best known in literature as a

Latin original by Stephanus Vigilius, Augsburg, 1542. Graesse, loc. ciL, v.,

Early English Books on Cookery. 

Some of the earliest English books on cookery, of which 
we quote three below, J: are anonymous. They represent 
almost three centuries, the fourteenth, fifteenth, and six- 
teenth. In the latter century the other European culture 
nations contributed about equally to this otherwise neglected 
branch of literature. In Italy was published the anonymous 
work entitled 'Epularium,'^^ a good abstract of cookery in 
vogue in most provinces of Italy.

THE HISTORIC LITERATURE OF COOKERY 27 

of Ferrara. It is illustrated with a portrait of the author, a 
person of grave and dignified appearance, and by two quaint 
engravings, representing a banquet and a kitchen, apparently 
in the open air. He gives receipts for a vast variety of 
dishes, and describes some of the dinners and suppers which 
he himself prepared. This publication, which depicts the 
feasts of the highest class of Italian society, was followed 
by the book of Giovanni Battista Eosetti,"*^ and the instruc- 
tive work by the privy cook {cuoco secreto) of Pope Pius V., 
Bartolomeo Scappi.f The latter contains many isolated 
observations, but no systematic appreciation of the art, and 
shows a renewed inclination to mannerism, which was 
perhaps inseparable from the experimental stages of the 
attempt to attain excellence and refinement. Layard gives 
an agreeable analysis of this work, from which we quote the 
following extract : ' Judging from his portrait which he 
presents to us, Scappi must have been a gentleman of 
dignified and senatorial appearance. His book was written, 
he tells us, for the instruction of Giovanni, his pupil, who 
was recommended to him by Cardinal Carpi, and who had 
been brought up from his tenderest age to the profession of 
a cook, of which profession Scappi desired to make the boy 
an honour. He commences by describing what a head-cook 
should be. Besides the leading general ideas he should 
have a full knowledge of every kind of beast, fowl, fish, and 
vegetable fit for human food, and of the proper season for 
placing them on the table. Moreover, he should have a 
perfect acquaintance with the tastes and preferences of his 
master. He proceeds to give directions as to the site, 
design, and arrangements for a kitchen, which should be 
spacious, airy, and cheerful. He then describes the various 
utensils and instruments required by the cook, of which he

gives a list of considerably above one hundred, illustrating 
his descriptions by engravings. He insists that the kitchen 
should be at some distance from the dwelling-house, to 
avoid the danger of people having access to it who might 
tamper with the food in preparation, the dread of poison 
always prevailing. He then shows how to judge of various 
condiments, and how to keep fresh such things as oil, lard, 
butter, and cheese, and mentions the wines best suited for 
making sauces. The discussion of salary, outfit, and honour- 
able treatment of the cook complete this part. Having 
instructed his pupil in the duties of a cook, he proceeds to 
give about 280 recipes for roasting, boiling, and other- 
wise preparing for the table the flesh of beasts and birds 
of various kinds, and for the proper sauces, and for soups, 
fricassees, mincemeat pies, and other dishes. Amongst 
the animals fit for eating are mentioned the chamois, stag, 
fallow-deer, wild-boar, bear, porcupine, hedgehog, hare, 
rabbits, guinea-pigs, and dormice ; amongst birds, nightin- 
gales, sparrows, redbreasts, hecca- ficlii, and swallows, 
ortolans, pheasants, red and gray partridges, francolins, 
peacocks, pea-fowl, cranes, herons, and wild geese. For 
the various ways of cooking all these beasts and birds he 
gives formulae. That for dressing bear's flesh is as follows : 
" The bear must be young, and must be caught in winter, 
when the flesh smells less strong than in July, though it is 
then fatter. Having first skinned the animal, you must 
take the best part of the carcase, such as the haunches and 
the shoulders, and keep them until they are sufficiently 
tender. Before putting them on the spit, leave them for a 
short time on a gridiron, and sprinkle them with salt, fennel, 
pepper, cinnamon, and cloves. Then roast them as you 
would the same parts of a goat. You can make the same 
dishes of bear's meat as you can of venison, but it is not 
much esteemed, nor is it commonly eaten." Nevertheless, 
Scappi informs us that he had often dressed it. He gives 



THE HISTORIC LITERATURE OF COOKERY 29 

elaborate directions for cooking the porcupine, an animal 
still occasionally served in Eoman trattorias. It is in 
season from the beginning of October to the end of January ; 
at other times it has a disagreeable odour, and requires at 
all times garlic, cloves, and rosemary to overpower any 
peculiar flavour. It should be served hot, with a sauce 
made of boiled mint, red vinegar, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, 
and its own gravy.' 

The period which was distinguished by the activity of the 
Italian group of authors closes with Vincenzio Cervio"^ and 
Dominico Eomoli.f Cervio was trinciante, or carver, to 
Cardinal Farnese. He describes the qualifications necessary 
for his office. The highest office in the household of a great 
Italian personage in the sixteenth century was that of 
scalco, who had the general direction and control of all the 
other servants, of the kitchen, and of the credenza, or side- 
board, ordered the manner in which the dinner should be 
served, and selected the dishes, the principal of which it 
was his duty to place on the table. He had, we are told, 
the life and honour of his master in his hand — his life, as it 
was not an uncommon practice to put poison into the food 
of rivals in love or enemies in politics ; his honour, as the 
honour of a great man was estimated by the magnificence 
and extravagance of his entertainments. After the scalco 
and the trinciante came the credenziero, who had charge of 
the credenza, or side-board, and of the plate and linen. The 
wine was in the keeping of the hottigUere, or butler. The 
cook held a very responsible charge in times when great 
people lived in constant fear of poison. It was essential 
that he should be thoroughly honest and trustworthy, and

affectionately devoted to his master, so that no bribe could 
induce him to compass his master's death or injury. 
Eomoh, in his work on the office of the scalco, says that 
while he himself held such an office he was in constant 
terror. The cook, he observes, should always keep his eyes 
open, and ever bear in mind the dangerous position in which 
he is placed. He was no! to allow idlers in the kitchen, 
nor permit anyone except those in whom he had entire con- 
fidence to touch the dishes for fear of treachery. Other 
servants in a great establishment of the sixteenth century 
were the copinere, or cup-bearer, who handed the wine ; the 
spenditore, who had the control of the expenses ; and the 
dispensiero, who had charge of the dispensa, where the pro- 
visions were kept, and who had to account to the scalco for 
the bread, wine, and other articles of food given out for 
daily consumption, as well as for the corn of the horses. 

The manner in which cookery and dining were treated in 
Italy towards the end of the sixteenth century is well set 
forth by Montaigne (1533-92) in his ' Journal of a Voyage 
in Italy,' which he made in 1580 (edit. Paris, 1774). He 
now and then invited to his table an Italian who had been 
mattre d'hotel to a Cardinal Caraffe down to the death of 
this latter. ' 1 made him describe the functions of his 
office. He delivered to me a discourse of this science of the 
gullet with a gravity and magisterial countenance, as if he 
were speaking to me of a great question in theology. He 
deciphered to me a difference of appetites — the appetite 
which one has before having broken fast, and that which 
one has after the second and third service ; the means of 
rousing and stimulating it ; the management of his sauces, 
first in general, and then particularizing the qualities of the 
ingredients and their effects; the differences of salads 
according to their season ; the salad which must be warmed, 
and that which must be served cold ; the mode of orna- 
menting and embeUishing them to make them still more

pleasant to the sight. After this he entered upon the order 
of the service, full of important and beautiful considerations; 
and all this set out in rich and magnificent words, such, 
indeed, as one employs in treating of the government of an 
empire.'"^ 

Spanish, French, and German Authors. 

In Spain were published two editions of the work of 
Eoberto Nola,t who was cook to King Ferdinand of Naples, 
and signed his name as E. de Nola. 

France in the sixteenth century produced two remarkable 
works, that of Pierre Pidoux,:|: and that of the celebrated 
Taillevant,§ the father of French sauces. 

Germany possessed cookery-books || which had originated 
in the fourteenth century, and several anonymous works, 
which generally bore the title * Kiichenmeisterey. ' The 
sixteenth century is distinguished by works, one from the 
pen of an otherwise unknov/n physician, Walther Eylif,1l

Principal Authors in all Countries during the Seventeenth 
Century. 

In the seventeenth century culinary art not only made 
practical progress, but it began to be treated theoretically, 
and the publications concerning it lost to some extent the 
character of curiosities. The most celebrated cookery-book 
was, and remained for some time, that by Fran9ois Pierre 
de la Varenne.f By the side of this were most renowned 
the three anonymous French treatises quoted below under 
note X. Of German QOokQiy-hodk^ the most celebrated was 
that by Maria Sophia Schellhammer, nee Conring, and by 
the side of this circulated cookery-books which bore the 
name of one or other of the large towns, like that of Niirn-

intervals, w^hich shows that their contents were of important and recognised 
value.

34 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



cookery-books published in the Italian language, one was 
by Martin Giegher,* a Bavarian born at Mosburg, the 
other by Vittorio Lancelotti,t of Camarino. The latter 
gives still more striking evidence than the cookery-books of 
Rosetti and Scappi, belonging to the sixteenth century, of 
the luxurious tables of the Roman Catholic clergy. The 
literary period closes with the work of Antonio Frugoli, 
entitled ' Pratica Escalcaria,' which is adapted to the wants 
of great people as w^ell as 'ordinary persons.'l 

The Eighteenth Century — French Literature takes the Lead. 
In the eighteenth century the French took the lead in 
cookery, although the number of works on the art published 
in other countries was perhaps as large as that published in 
France. In particular the number of cookery-books§ pub- 
lished in Germany since the end of the seventeenth century 
is legion ; most of them were called after the city in 
which they were published. Of celebrated cooks in France 
who also wrote works, the following are the most note- 
worthy : Menon,|| A. Viard,1[ and Antoine Beauvilliers.**

THE HISTORIC LITERATURE OF COOKERY 35 



The latter was a Parisian restaurateur, and lived from 1754 
to 1820. He had very great influence in purifying culinary 
recipes, and shaping the practice by the introduction of 
exactness and method in the main, as regards French 
cookery such as we know it. Brillat-Savarin in his 
* Physiologic du Gout,' p. 289, has given an interesting 
memoir of the character and career of Beauvilliers, which 
we recommend our readers to peruse. The first edition of 
Beauvilhers' ' L'Art du Cuisinier ' was published in 1814, 
and the w^ork was republished many times, but, though 
altered and enlarged, not improved after the death of its 
author. 

We have yet to consider two important works in the 
French language which were very popular about the middle 
of last century. The one, ' Le Cuisinier Moderne,' is by 
Vincent La Chapelle, c/zc/ dc cuisine to the Prince of 
Orange and Nassau (second edition, Hague, 1742). It is 
a beautifully written, exhaustive treatise, in five octavo 
volumes, full of information and instruction. In his pre- 
face the author exposes a plagiarism on the part of the 
editor of a new issue of a work which we have quoted 
above, note J, p. 32, as the * Cuisinier Eoyal et Bourgeois,' to 
which now, however, the name and title of ' La Chapelle ' 
were fraudulently prefixed. The other work, published re- 
peatedly at Paris (we have the edition of 1758 before us, 
but it is not stated what place it takes in the series of 
editions) in three large duodecimo volumes, of together 
more than 1,200 pages, is entitled * Les Dons de Comus, ou 
I'Art de la Cuisine reduit en Pratique.' This also is a 
highly accomplished work, as already indicated by its 
preface, and fully borne out by its text, and refreshing by 
its correct historically true nomenclature. 

In some of its menus the work exhibits a tendency to 
mannerism, e.g., to dinners and suppers limited to one kind 
of meat only, tout en hoeufj or veal, or mutton, or even tout 



36 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



en cochon. The author finds such arrangemeuts to be 
results of caprice, and soon leaves them for what he calls 
simple and natural ones. We shall have to refer lower 
down to some special features of these works, to which we 
must limit any further observations. 

In 1802 was begun at Paris the publication of a duodecimo 
annual volume, entitled ' Almanach des Gourmands.'"^ It 
was conceived and carried out with the aid of contributors 
by one Grimod de la Eeyniere, known as a culinary author 
only, and the subject of an interesting bit of biography. 
He was the grandson of Gaspard Grimod de la Eeyniere, 
the son of a charcutier, a vendor of cooked meat, who had, 
by dint of genius and enterprise, become fermier-gSndral of 
taxes and Postmaster-General of France; he purchased 
his nobility, and becoming one of the most noted (fonce) 
gourmands of the eighteenth century, died characteristically 
in 1754, in consequence of an indigestion contracted by a 
surfeit of 2^dt(! de foie gras. His widow, 7zie Mazade, 
married a M. de la Ferriere, and kept up to her death the 
best house and table in Paris. Her 7naUre d' hotel was the 
then noted Damours, who was said to have elevated the 
science of politeness and social culture, and the practice of 
the amphitryonic service, to such perfection that nobody 
before or after him attained equal excellence. It was here 
in the establishment of his grandmother, and after her 
death, in 1773, in that of his father, that the editor of the 
* Almanach ' collected the principal and earliest experience, 
of which he subsequently made use in his writings (c/. 

* 'Almanach des Gourmands, servant de guide dans les moyens de 
faire excellente chere. Par un vieil amateur.' Paris, 1802-1812, 8 vols., 
12mo. The first six volumes are dated 1802-1808, the seventh is dated 
1810, the eighth 1812. This volume has a dedication to the shade of 
Vatel, cook of the great Cond^, who committed suicide with a sword 
because the fish did not arrive in time from the sea coast, when his master

'Manuel des Amphitryons,' 1808, p. 291). In his early- 
days the third Baron Grimod was an impious son and 
grandson, and at his banquets perpetrated coarse practical 
jokes, in which he treated the memory of his great-grand- 
father, the charcutier, with contempt. His extravagance 
compelling his father to put him under some restraint, he 
was, under a lettre de cachet, banished to Lorraine, but his 
father dying six months afterwards, he came into possession 
of the ancestral fortune, which had been squeezed out of 
the French taxpayers. The Eevolution * retorqueated,' and 
Eeyniere's fortune having changed proprietors, he luckily 
remained in possession of his head, and took to literature 
for the purpose of making a living. He began the 

* Almanach ' in the last year of the Eepublic, and continued 
it during the prosperous years of the Empire, and after a 
long pause during the Eestoration. This publication thus 
appeared in two series, the first terminating with the eighth 
volume (it had not been an annual for four years) in 1812 ; 
the second series began in 1825. The first series contained, 
besides general essays, critical reviews of Parisian culinary 
establishments, which are praised or condemned, and in 
such a manner that it is probable that praise could be had 
for a consideration, and those who did not advertise were 
at least not praised. The coarseness of the conceptions 
and the extent of the exaggerations contained in these early 
volumes have not influenced the practice of good society, 
but have helped to make the Paris style of cooking compli- 
cated and overladen. The * faisan Lucullus ' of Vuillemot 
is perhaps the acme of exaggeration in this direction. In 
later publications Eeyniere overcame these faults, and his 

* Manuel des Amphitryons,' Paris, 1808, is a work of great 
historical and practical merit, and written in a most 
polished and attractive style, a monument of the refinement 
of the eighteenth century, which perished in the Eevolution, 
and is not likely soon to be revived. 



38 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



One of the most accomplished of French magiric authors 
of the present centmy was Marie Antoine Careme, a 
Parisian, 1784 to 1833. He was one of fifteen children of 
an operative, and at the age of eleven found employment in 
a cooking-shop. At the age of seventeen, having been for a 
year assistant to a restaurateur, he became * first raised pie- 
maker' {premier tourtier) of the renowned pastrycook 
Bailly. Here he designed lodUs after all kinds of engravings 
in the National Library, and competition in the most com- 
plicated structures of paste became a rage, and the pies a 
prevalent fashion. The successors of the imtissier Gendron, 
jealous of the great, the illustrious x\vice, engaged the young 
tourtier, with liberty to use his talents, mainly on extra- 
ordinary occasions, and in the high office of maitre d'hotel. 
Then he came to mount dinners for the Directorate, became 
intimate with the house-master of Prince Talleyrand, one 
Bouchee (also called Bouchesec, perhaps a descriptive 
sobriquet), and with Laguepierre, the cook of Bonaparte, 
w^ho died during the retreat from Moscow. Having got into 
affluent circumstances, Careme wrote a work on ' The 
Eoman Table,' but it was lost-, together with its illustrations. 
He then wrote works more within his professional range, 
which are quoted below. ^ His success had made him 
excessively. vain, and caused him to pen sentences such as 
this : * I contemplated from behind my furnaces the kitchens 
of India, China, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Germany, 
and Switzerland, and I felt crumbhng under my critical 
blows the ignoble fabric of routine.' Thus spoke his Parisian 
conceit, and in a similar strain many of his observations

were rendered. After the fall of Bonaparte, upon whose 
culinary agents he, having from his business associa- 
tions strong Legitimist leanings, occasionally published 
jealous criticisms, he arranged for the restored Bourbons 
the gigantic banquet in the Plain of Virtues in ISltt, and 
directed the table of the Emperor Alexander of Eussia at 
Paris in 1814 and 1815, and subsequently at the Congress 
of Aix-la-Chapelle. He was one of the chiefs of the kitchen 
of the Eegent, afterwards George IV., at Brighton in 1816 
and 1817, and again for a short period on a later occasion. 
Travelling to Vienna to arrange some grand dinners for the 
Austrian Emperor, he became cliej of the kitchen of the 
then English Ambassador to that monarch. Carome ulti- 
mately resided at Paris, from which town no inducement 
could draw him for long, following his literary inclination, 
and died there in 1833 before having completed the fiftieth 
year of his life. Under Eichaut, the celebrated saucier of 
the house of Conde, he learned the working of the sauces ; 
during the great fetes given at the H6tel-de-Ville at Paris, 
under the direction of L'Asne, he acquired the practical 
knowledge concerning ornamented cold dishes; at the 
Elysee Bourbon, under the management of Eobert and 
Laguepierre, he learned, as he terms it, the elegance of the 
modern kitchen, and the ensemble of a great administra- 
tion. He was thus well qualified to be an exponent of the 
sumptuous banqueting magirism, and contributed not a 
little to increase the luxury and expense of social entertain- 
ments in all parts of the civilized world. Autodidact of 
great ability, yet without fundamental philosophical culture, 
he used titles for some of his disquisitions which cover a 
much greater field than the contents of his chapters. Thus, 
in the ' Parallel of the Ancient and Modern Cookery,' the 
adjective * ancient ' does not apply, as one would expect, to 
the times of the Greeks and Eomans or Egyptians, but only 
to the cookery of the past parts of the eighteenth century 



40 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

as represented in the ' Dons de Comus,' Menon's ' Soupers 
de la Cour,' and the * Cuisinier Moderne ' of La Chapelle. 
He worked and wrote, as he himself said, not for the mass 
of the people, but for the class of sensualists (c/es sensuels), 
and with their extinction under the influence of the July 
Eevolution of 1830, his exaggerated style of ornamentation 
and garnishing of all kinds of pastry became obsolete. 

Amongst the important works of French culinary authors 
who have developed special branches of the art are a 
' Treatise on Baking,' particularly of cakes, by Parmentier,* 
and one on confectionery by J. J. Machet.f The widest 
and most lasting reputation was obtained by Fran9ois 
Appert,! who invented a method for preserving all animal 
and vegetable substances in a state in which they remain 
fit for aliment during several years, which is now practised 
on a very large scale all over the world, and has given rise 
to a colossal trade. 

In 1826 was published at Paris an anonymous work 
under the title of 'Physiologic du Gout,' etc.§ An edition 
of the year 1810 was accompanied with a preface by the 
physician Eicherand, and a poem by Berchoux. It appears 
to be a book written with a great deal of knowledge 
of the world, but abounds in extravagances, which, notwith- 
standing their dialectic glitter, not rarely reach the para- 
doxical. Its lively style and frequently elegant diction 
attracted to it many readers, and its contents were con- 
sidered as oracular by the newly made in society, and it 
was translated into several languages. Bereft of its French

dress, its exaggerated manner became more apparent. Its 
author was Brillat-Savarin, who in 1826 was a judge 
{mcmhre) of the Court of Cassation at Paris, and died in 
that year, a few months after the pubHcation of the work. 
Besides the ' Physiologic du Gout,' Savarin wrote only two 
pamphlets — one on * Duelling,' and another on ' Judicial 
Administration.' In 1793 he had been Maire of Belley, the 
capital of the Bugey, in the department of the Ain, in the 
south of France, at the foot of the Alps ; became a member 
of the States-General, but subsequently opposed the Con- 
stituent Assembly, and followed the banner of the Girondists, 
but escaping their fate, fled at the time of the Terror, first 
to Cologne, then to Switzerland, and ultimately to the 
United States of America, where he resided during three 
years, partly at Boston, partly at Hartford, Connecticut, 
and at New York, teaching French and playing the violin 
in orchestras. After the advent of the Directorate he 
returned to France, became public prosecutor of the 
Criminal Tribunal of Versailles, later on one of the judges 
of the Court of Cassation. His qualities are generally con- 
structed by biographers out of this book, but were very 
different according to the testimony of contemporaries. 
Thus says Careme in his ' Memoirs ' concerning his taste : 
' Neither M. Cambaceres nor M. Brillat-Savarin have ever 
known how to eat properly. Both liked the strong and 
vulgar things, and simply filled their stomachs ; this is true 
to the letter. M. de Savarin was a coarse eater, and spoke 
little, and without ease, as it seemed to me; he looked 
heavy, and had the aspect of a curd. At the end of a meal 
he was absorbed by his digestion; I have seen him sleep.' 
To this portrait quoted by Dumas, the latter adds : ' Brillat- 
Savarin was neither a gastronomer nor a gourmet, but 
simply a vigorous eater. He belonged to the intimates of 
Madame Eecamier — was tall, moved heavily, had a vulgar 
aspect, and his dress was always a dozen years behind the 



42 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

fashion; these drcumstances produced him the nickname 
of "the tambour-major" of the Court of Cassation.' We 
know from another judge of the same court, a colleague of 
Savarin, that the latter could no doubt hold forth theo- 
retically on culinary subjects, but that his dinners were of 
very inferior quality. * One nowhere heard better talk 
about dining, and nowhere ate worse dinners, than at 
Brillat-Savarin's table,' said M. Pages. These circum- 
stances have produced an impression that Dr. Eicherand 
had a share in the spiritual authorship of this work. How- 
ever interesting it may be as a jcu cVesiirit, the * Physiologic 
du Gout ' has added nothing to the development of culinary 
art ; the only (four) recipss left by Savarin prove that he 
was not an inventor. 

In Germany, Baron (or, as he is mostly called, Count) 
Eumohr published a work written by his privy cook, 
Konig,* to which we shall have to make repeated reference. 
A. Anthust and Baron Vaerst| published important works 
on gastrosophy, in which the French standard was at least 
attained. The scientific knowledge of food, which bad been 
discussed and enlarged during the latter half of the last 
century by Johann Friedrich Ziickert§ (1737 to 1798), was 
augmented with its chemical consideration by Baron Liebig,|| 
mainly after the precedent of the French chemist, Louis 
Proust, Food in general, and its dietetic relative estima- 
tion, was discussed by Jacob Moleschott,1I the professor of

The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries— English 
Culinary Works. 

In England the learned Eobert Warnert published a work 
of mainly an historical character, on the cookery of the 
ancient English. It was entitled ' Culinary Antiquities ; or, 
Curious Traits relating to the Culinary Affairs of the Old 
Enghsh.' It consists of the following six parts: 1. The 
Forme of Cury. A roll of ancient cookery compiled about 
1390 by the master cooks of King Kichard II. ; 196 for- 
mulae, with list, and numbered. 2. A contemporaneous 
manuscript with 91 formulae. 3. A collection of recipes in 
English cookery, date uncertain. 4. Eecipes for the pre- 
servation of fruit. 5 and 6. Details of the viands consumed 
at the feasts following the enthronisation of bishops and 
archbishops. Also additional notes at the end of the volume. 
This curious work shows the coarseness of the mode of 
living in ancient times, and the fearful extravagance of the 
high clergy.

cookery mainly based on French precedents, while the curing 
of meat and fish was described by J. Eobinson.* Graesse, 
in his * History of Literature,' believed that Kitchiner, 
whose name is on the title of a celebrated cookery-book, t 
was a pseudonym. But this is not the case. Dr. Kitchiner 
was a learned physician who lived and practised in London, 
was the author not only of the culinary work here quoted, 
but also of several other works, amongst them one on 
* Training,' and another on * The Preservation of the Eyes.' 
A tablet to his memory is fixed in St. Pancras parish 
church. 

A curiosity is an Indian cookery-book, t translated from 
the Persian, published in English. It is not stated whether 
any Indian original was or is in existence, and it is just 
possible that it was written in Persian originally, though in 
India. East Indian cookery, however, never attained any 
development as an art, and the Hindoo confectionery, such 
as it was, exhibited by imported Indian specialists at 
the Food Exhibition in South Kensington, was not only 
extremely simple and monotonous, but very coarse, and 
repugnant to an educated palate. 

We have yet to mention A. Soyer, the author of ' The 
Gastronomic Eegenerator ; or, A New System of Cookery ' 
(4th edition, London, 1847; 8th edition, ih., 1852, 8vo., in 
which a spirit-lamp for frying an omelette was propounded) ; 
also of the ' Pantropheon,' a kind of history of cookery, with 
many illustrations and references (London, 1853, 8vo.). 
Soyer held a practical position in London during the middle 
of the present century, and enjoyed some publicity during 
the Crimean War, when he was commissioned to improve

the camp-cooking of the troops in the field. He was the 
inventor of the hundred-guinea dish, to produce which a 
hundred turkeys had to be killed, of which each gave only 
the two dark meat lumps from the ischiadic region, called 
by the French le sot Vy laisse, and notorious by Eeyniere's 
wholesale roasting of turkeys to obtain these bits, from 
which absurd extravagance Soyer no doubt borrowed his 
owm. 

Modern Publications — French and English. 

Amongst the more noteworthy French publications of the 
present century we have yet to mention M. de Courchamps' 
'Dictionary';* further, the great 'Dictionary'! published 
by Alexandre Dumas in 1873. This work contains much 
excellent matter, and owing to the technical supervision 
extended to it by D. F. Vuillemot, a pupil of Careme's, is in 
the main reliable ; but it also contains much irrelevant 
matter in the shape of inventions of the nominal author, 
flat anecdotes, and shallow observations. Much of this 
shortcoming is no doubt due to the alleged circumstance of 
Dumas having availed himself of the assistance of subor- 
dinate contributors, whose performance, consisting mainly 
in abstracting older authors, he did not take the trouble to 
control. This circumstance also led to many repetitions ; 
but leaving these out of sight, the work is an admirable 
compilation, and in many parts an enthusiastic picture of 
French cookery at the beginning of the last quarter of the 
century now drawing to its close. 

An interesting and in some respects important English 
publication, intended specially for the use of the English in 
India, entitled, ' Culinary Jottings for Madras,';}; saw the

light in 1878, and quickly passed through several editions. 
Its author was, and is now, a distinguished officer in the 
army. The work possesses a great vivacity of style, and 
manifests a close practical acquaintance with some forms 
of cookery, and a thorough knowledge of the usages and 
wants of the EngUsh kitchen in Hindostan. It also ex- 
hibits a comprehensive knowledge of the latest French 
culinary literature, and not a little of the conventional 
worship of Brillat-Savarin. The first, or general, part of the 
work is written in a chatty, familiar style, and fills 334 pages, 
while the actual recipes are distributed over a second part, 
consisting of the details of thirty menus, covering about 
160 pages more. By this arrangement the second part 
becomes aphoristic, and can be consulted by the general 
European student only with the aid of the alphabetical 
index ; but it is probable that the arrangement was of par- 
ticular value to the circle for the use of which it was 
designed. The author in many places attributes to bones 
the usually alleged, but either entirely erroneous or greatly 
exaggerated value in the preparation of soups and sauces, 
though this misapprehension is particularly costly in 
kitchens which, like those of India, have to keep up their 
fires with small wood and charcoal. That he entitled his 
treatise as one on * Eeformed Cookery for Anglo-Indian 
Exiles ' rather reflects upon the state of Indian cookery 
before his appearance on the scene. Curries are relegated 
to homely use, and not one occurs in the thirty menus for 
dinners ; on the other hand, there are many of the over- 
complicated and over-cooked entrees and entremets of the 
transcendental magirism. The bills of fare are given in 
French, with a goodly number of the usual unintelligible 
denominations.

777^ HISTORIC LITERATURE OF COOKERY 47 



Latest French Literature. 

French cookery as accepted during the last twenty-five 
years has been most sumptuously represented in * The 
Book of the Kitchen,' by Jules Gouffe,* who for some years 
was culinary officer of the Jockey Club at Paris. The pon- 
derous and elegantly-printed tome is divided into two parts, 
of which the first describes what we may call ordinary 
household cookery (/rt cuisine cles menages), ^^. 1 to 338; 
while the second part, pp. 339 to 804, treats of the cookery 
of great establishments {la grande cuisine). This division 
is somewhat arbitrary ; e.g., crayfish soup, in French bisque 
cVecrevisses, which on the Continent is a popular soup in 
thousands of households, hotels, and restaurants, is not 
given in the first part, but only in the second. On com- 
parison of the two parts, it appears clearly that in society 
no such sharp separation exists as is here marked off ; the 
grande cuisine is nothing better than the cuisine de menage 
in the disguise of a great mass of perfectly useless garnishes, 
which, with the main viands, are elevated on socles of 
stearin, or propped up by croustades, surrounded by borders 
never intended to be eaten, and surmounted by unmeaning 
skewers of silver poked through cock's combs, crayfish, 
truffles, and rudely carved pieces of carrots, turnips, and 
beetroot. The author's recipes are expressed in aphorisms, 
each of which begins with a new line, so that upw^ards of a 
third of the space of the more than 800 pages is not occu- 
pied by printed matter. The author's recipes are eminently 
practical, because they run on the lines of tradition, although 
he says that ' most of the books on cookery pubhshed up to 
his time were useless.' This sw^eeping assertion is made 
out of sight of the literature of the science, and the very

fact of authors copying others, with which he severely re- 
proaches them, shows the practical value of the matters 
copied, multiplied and preserved. However well the author 
may have ' braised,' he fails in describing either its theory 
or its practice ; he is quite unconscious of the current fallacy 
about bones and their value for the production of broth, but 
relies, as a good cook should, upon the assistance of a good 
many kilos of beef, veal, mutton, fowl and game. The 
author evidently has not yet adopted the teaching of his 
eminent countryman, Louis Proust, regarding the essence of 
meat. Of chartreuses he only gives one of fruit (p. 758), 
namely, apples, and one of partridges (p. 601), perhaps 
because he was an admirer of Careme, and, like him, dis- 
regarded his own teaching and all tradition, to the effect 
that a chartreuse to be such must not contain any meat, 
but only vegetables. But although ' most cookery-books 
are useless,' the two chartreuses so called are only para- 
phrases of old recipes, one for chartreuse de 2^omvies, the 
other for a compound case of vegetables with partridge, 
called chartreuse de perdreatcx. The gateau Savarin, a mere 
modern anonymous plagiarism of the old French Ratan cake, 
is unwarily accepted, though happily, we might perhaps 
say necessarily, seeing that Gouffe is a practical man, the 
culte of Savarin is not paraded. Many of the author' * 
general observations, e.g., those against the absurd French 
names of dishes, are most excellent ; but the illustrations of 
combinations, which, like the Bouisson de Coquillage, facing 
p. 696, might pass as showplates in a fishmonger's shop- 
window, seem to us to be out of place in the book, as their 
incarnation would be on a dinner-table. The author has 
not numbered his recipes, perhaps in execution of the some- 
what mystic principle announced in his preface, that he had 
fait autre chose que ce que Von a fait jusqiiici. We have 
carefully scrutinized the recipes and general observations of 
Gouffe on bouilloji, blond de veau and the several consommSs

of meat, fowl, game and fish, and have been quite unable to 
discover any objective standard by which the value or 
concentration of his broths could be ascertained, or even 
estimated. While he carefully weighed and measured 
numerous ingredients, he never ascertained what he ex- 
tracted from his stock-pot, and by this omission vitiated 
his quantations. This omission was, and is, so general in 
the grande cuisine that the * Almanach des Gourmands' for 
1826 said that it was a fact, based upon observation, that 
the grand cooks produced bad soup. Careme was in his 
time highly incensed at this criticism, but it has retained 
its truthfulness down to the present day, when extremely 
dilute, pale, almost tasteless preparations of hot water, with 
some finely minced roots or herbage distributed in them, 
are put forth as consommis, of which they are in every respect 
either the negative or the reverse. Although the work of 
Gouffe excels in style many of his forerunners, it is not free 
from grave misapprehensions, arising from the fact that he 
occasionally loses sight of his principles and does just the 
same as that which has been done hitherto; thus, tcndrons, 
the soft rih-cartilages of the calf, are throughout termed 
tendons^ i.e., sinews, a confusion w^hich, initiated by Beau- 
'^illiers, has affected, during the last eighty years, all those 
treatises which have uncritically copied his recipes.

the work of J. Eottenhofer."^ The author was for some 
time first cook to the late Maximilian II., King of Bavaria,

tains 1,024 closely-printed pages, and dispersed over thes3 
are a great number of vignettes and drawings of plants, 
animals, dishes, and apparatus, all printed from woodcuts. 
The headings of recipes are 2,345 in number, and are given 
in the German as well as the French language ; but to many 
of these headings, curiously enough, there is no text at all ; 
we can only surmise that the texts were omitted to abbre- 
viate the book, and the headings were retained to preserve 
the order of the original arrangement. The style is descrip- 
tive, not ordering or commanding, and by its original 
grammar and syntax essentially culinary ; it is variegated 
by a great number of Germanized French words, such as 
7nijotireii, flambircn, etc., and by many inverse attempts to 
construct German expressions for fresh things or ideas, 
such as Fleisch-Essenz-Grund for fond, or Sidz (which in 
German means a inckle, i.e., a pickling liquid, correctly 
called a Sulze) for jelly, both savoury and sweet. Such 
misunderstanding or misapplication of well-established 
words can only lead to dire confusion, and the practice 
should be avoided. The recipes are mainly based upon 
French precedents, but are mostly well understood and 
practically elaborated. Bone - worship is subdued, but 
Proust's extract of meat, even as revived by Liebig, is not 
mentioned. Throughout the work reigns the same tendency 
to overgarnishing w^hich we have noticed in Gouffe's recipes, 
and the socles, i:)edestals, vases, canaijis, and other erections 
cast in stearin are numerous and mostly depicted. Num- 
bers of small dishes and cakes are portrayed as served on 
colossal silver dishes, tazzas, vases, and other indescribable 
apparatus, such as abound in the platerooms of kings or of 
London confectioners. Many peculiarities make the book 
difficult to use ; thus, the author terms many puree soups 
coulis, both in French and German ; but a coulis is a strong, 
thick, savoury sauce, and not a soup, and the word, though 
a good ancient French expression for what it was intended 



THE HISTORIC LITERATURE OF COOKERY 51 

to symbolize, does not occur in Gouffe's work a single time. 
The allusions to English cookery, particularly roasts and 
puddings, are of the nature common in German and French 
magiric literature, and the results admit of explanation by 
the relative differences in the materials and the fuel. The 
actual strength of the work consists in the fact that many 
of its parts are based upon a wide experience ; all articles 
on what we will call sober cookery for the well-to-do and 
educated middle class are very imperfect, some of coarse 
simplicity, and the illustrations are sufficient to take away 
the breath of ever so rich a man, if he thought that he 
would be expected to have produced in his establishment 
even a moderate selection of them. Their service alone 
would be very laborious, and carry many of the guests who 
had to suffer its inconvenience over to the party of the 
adherents of service a la Busse. 



CHAPTER III. 

KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS. 

Furniture and Apparatus required in a well-appointsd 
Kitchen. 

The agent most essential for any kind of cooking is a fire. 
The most easily made fire is one of dry hrushiuood, but this 
will only burn for a short time, unless the wood be con- 
stantly resupplied. To make such a fire more lasting, it is 
necessary to feed it with thicker wood, split logs, or faggots. 
With the aid of such a simple fire on the hearthstone we 
can prepare some simple articles of food in a direct manner. 
We can grill meat before it, by holding it on a stick near 
the flame or live coal ; we can imbed sundry tubers, such as 



52 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



potatoes, fuDgi, such as mushrooms and truffles, or onions, in 
the ashes, and let them get cooked ; or we can heat stones, 
and, when they are suitably hot, bake upon them a prepared 
flour-paste, such as that which yields chuppatties. All these 
elementary modes of cooking should be well studied by 
travellers, explorers, colonists, soldiers, and sailors. 

Next to the fire in importance for cooking is a pot of 
carthemuare or metal, for the reception of food to be cooked 
in water. Over the simple brushwood fire such a pot would 
stand on three stones, or as many stones as would be 
necessary to support it. When such an arrangement of 
stones round a fire assumes any permanency it is called a 
hearth. Or the cooking-pot may be suspended over the fire 
on a tripod, made of three sticks or faggots. From the most 
simple fireplace of primitive man to the most complicated 
cooking range"^ of the modern hotel is a great progression of 
many stages, which we dare not attempt to give even a sketch 
of, though it would be well worth a special study in con- 
nection with our subject. Suffice it to say, that in every 
kitchen heat should he easily applicahle to food in three forms : 
(a) As radiating heat from the open fire, for roasting, grill- 
ing and toasting ; (b) as conducted heat applied to the 
bottom of vessels of metal or earthenware, for boiling, 
stewing, and frying ; (c) as radiating and conducted heat 
simultaneously, through the instrumentality of an oven. 
The open fire-grate is that form of cooking apparatus which 
is in the present day of coal best understood in this country. 
Ovens are frequently constructed on faulty principles, 
particularly in this, that they are heated on one side only, 
and have no bottom heat. Every householder should see 
that his oven be supplied with heat under the bottom, 
whether it be by the admission of flame from the fire in the 
main grate, or by a separate small fire underneath the oven 

* Ranrje originally meant the Jire-hucl; or rost, of imralhl bars on the 
hearth, on which the fire burns, so as to admit air from below. 



KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CUIINARY AXIOMS 53 



itself. The latter is the most economical and most efficient 
arrangement. How little fuel is required to cook a good 
dinner in an oven can be learnt from the use of those forms 
of cooking apparatus which work with petroleum. The 
cleanest of all sources of heat is spirit of wine, but the 
Excise laws of this country make its use difficult. IVood- 
spirit may be used, but is liable to impregnate the air with 
its odour. Spirit was applied to some forms of elementary 
cookery by Soyer, but his methods and apparatus have not 
survived the enthusiasm of novelty. At present spirit is 
mainly applied to effect the final ebullition of water for 
making coffee or tea. Gas is also a relatively clean material 
for the production of heat, but is liable to considerable 
waste, and, in view of the exorbitant prices exacted by the 
monopolists of London and other places, is not applicable 
to general use, and never economical. As an auxiliary in 
the kitchen, particularly at times when there is no large 
coal-fire alight, or as a continued moderate source of heat 
for apparatus which has to be kept warm, particularly the 
7vater-bath, or bain-marie, it is of great value. Charcoal, 
next to wood, once the most frequently used source of heat, 
is now little employed in the more northern part of Europe. 
It was essential for the old form of braising, particularly for 
the production of top-heat over the braising-pan. It will 
be useful in all places where gas or petroleum, or common 
coal, or wood, are less easily obtained ; but where gas is 
available it will supersede charcoal. It is not improbable 
that the progress of science will teach us more economical 
and cleaner modes of applying heat for cooking and warm- 
ing, such as the use of liyclrocjen and carbonic oxide (water- 
gas), or electricity converted into heat ; but at present 
coals are the principal source of heat in the kitchen, and 
their use as such, and in the form of coah (or cohe), will 
probably become more and more specialised. 



54 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Movable Apparatus required for an Ordinary Establishment. 

There are some skilful inventions relating to cookery 
which would be of great value if the practical executants of 
culinary art were of a more Athenian novelty-seeking disposi- 
tion. We remember the introduction of Captain Warren's 
culinary apparatus, and have not changed our opinion of 
its great value for every establishment the authority of 
which will succeed in seeing it used according to the pre- 
scription of its inventor. We read in ' Wyvern's ' work 
(p. 17), that when he was staying once with a friend on the 
(East Indian) hills, the water for his bath was brought in 
the outer vessel of a ' Warren's patent cooking-pot,' and 
further, the host said ' that the inner vessel made a capital 
tom-tom for beating a sholah.' Here, then, we have the 
example of a good instrument completely diverted from 
its proper to inferior uses. But on p. 19 the same author 
finds that his native Indian cook fully appreciated 'Warren's 
fish-kettle and vegetable steamer.' This introduction will 
explain why and under which conditions we believe that 
a Warren's cooking-pot may be part of the heavier sort 
of movable apparatus. 

To the same category belongs a Pcqnns digester, with a 
movable tin lining and cover thereto. The digester is to 
be hermetically closed by a top-screw, and to be heated by 
a gas, or spirit, or charcoal flame. We have used this for 
flesh, fish, and fowl. Particularly a boned, stuffed fowl 
done in normal broth is cooked in this digester better than 
anywhere else, and comes out with a rich appetising flavour. 
The apparatus has the advantage that, once set going, it 
requires no attention, except to the lowering of the gas- 
flame in case the safety-valve should begin to blow. 

Of cooking-pans the following should form part of what 
the French call the kitchen battery: Four steicpans of 
different sizes, and six saucepans, also of varying capacity. 



KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS 55 

One large muce'pan should be provided with a steamer, 
mounted on its upper rim. A three-gallon digester of 
copper or iron, a so-called stoch-pot, provided with a brass 
tap at its lower end, is a useful reservoir of broth or water, 
but in our economy has, owing to the systematic exclusion 
of bones, lost some of its former importance. A braising- 
pan should admit of the application of top-heat by live 
charcoal or hot embers. A frying-imn should have a most 
perfect polish all over its inner iron or steel surface, so 
perfect, indeed, that it could act as a mirror. Such a 
surface conducts heat quickly, and prevents catching, 
therefore secures fritures, particularly those from which 
much fat has to be excluded, from their worst danger. A 
saute-pan, also spelled sauta-pan, should always be made of 
copper, well tinned, and provided with a broad handle and 
a fitting lid. A special omelette-pan should, like the frying- 
pan, be of polished steel, and kept perfectly bright. A 
fluted gridiron should be silvered or tinned, and have a 
small gravy-trough. A tin fish-kettle, with a perforated 
bottom piece raised above the bottom plate, and removable, 
a so-called drainer, should be adapted in size, not only to 
ordinary use, but also to an occasional demand for the 
cooking of larger fish to be set before guests. An ordinary 
iron kettle, of a capacity of a gallon or two, will serve for 
heating water to ebullition, and for serving it out in small 
portions boiling, such as the larger kitchen-boiler does not 
supply. In kitchens where roasting on the spit is to be 
practised, at least two spits of different sizes will be 
required ; but where that is not to be, a roasting-jack and 
screen will have to be provided. The concavity of the 
screen should be kept in a brightly-polished state, as only 
thus it will be able to reflect and concentrate the rays of 
the fire upon the joint in the focus under the jack. A 
toater-bath of copper, bain-marie of the French, a longish 
flat pan, with a handle at each end, holding from six to 



56 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

eight small saucepans, should be kept in a generally ^\arm 
place, never heated to boiling. This arrangement serves to 
keep sauces, gravies, and small preparations hot until the 
time for their being served up shall have arrived. 

Of heavier apparatus is further required a large mortar of 
stone, granite, or marble, or of iron, on a cylindrical incce 
of a tree, partially imbedded in the wood, and a hox-iuood 
2:)estle for use with the mortar ; it serves for pounding meat 
and other materials for farces and imr(^es. There is also 
required a clioiiping -block, being a cylindrical section of a 
tree with three inserted legs, for chopping and dressing 
meat. The chopper and dressing-knives should be suspended 
close to the chopping-block. 

Of lighter movable ai^tparatus the kitchen requires three 
iron galvanized spoons of different sizes, and a number of 
ivooden sjjoojis. It is advisable to have a dozen of these, as 
they are much used for stirring, and must not be used 
except after having been washed and dried. A basting-ladle 
is indispensable in the management of roasts, and although 
some people hold basting in pretended abhorrence, the 
flavour of the roast and its gravy depends so much upon 
proper basting that we hold a proper ladle for its per- 
formance to be a necessary instrument. A fish-slice is 
needed to dress and filet the larger kinds of fish. A set of 
sheioers, to be kept in a cylindrical tin box, is requisite for 
the proper dressing and trussing of joints, fowls and game, 
so as to keep the various parts in proximity to each other, 
and prevent extremities from getting dry or burnt. The 
skewers for the larger joints, such as roast beef, or lamb, or 
boned roll of beef, are mostly supplied by the butcher. 
These are made of wood. A set of larding needles is an 
essential in an elegant kitchen. The needles must be of 
several sizes to be able to receive and carry, the one thicker, 
the other thinner lardoons or bacon-strips. These needles, 
like the skewers, should be kept in a cylindrical tin box. 



KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS 57 



The cook should further have suspended near the chopping- 
block a chopper, a meat-saw, a broad cJiisel measuring two 
inches along the cuttmg edge, and a mallet. With these 
instruments the bones of any joints can be elegantly ad- 
justed, and the task of carving much facilitated. Three 
culinary knives, of different sizes, for the dressing of meat ; 
a mincing-hnife, being half knife, half chopper, but light 
and sharp ; a o'och'mg -knife, a crescent-shaped tool used 
to mince with its convex edge, without noise, meat as well 
as vegetables, and a square mincing -hoard of thick, hard 
wood, complete the outfit having reference to the treatment 
of the flesh of animals. 

For the production of dishes in which flour is used we 
require two plain pudding moulds, for use in hot water; a 
cake-mould, for baking in the oven ; two plain border 
moulds ; a paste jagger, with revolving disks ; a set of 
p)astry-cutters ; two dozen of patty, dariole or fanchonette 
pans ; a dozen mince-pie-pans ; a baking sheet, or several 
sheets, if there be oven room ; two baking-tins, two bread 
or cake tins, two souffl^e tins of various sizes; Si flour-dredger; 
a sugar-dredger ; a pepper-box, with a small perforated 
well-fixed lid ; a bread-grater, and a smaller grater for 
nutmeg. For the treatment of vegetables there should be a 
set of vegetable ctUters, a root-knife, and several knives, a 
separate set to be used for onions exclusively. Oi forks there 
should be a great dishing -up -fork, and several smaller 
ordinary companions. Of various apparatus a toasting-fork 
is perhaps the most useful. A block-tin colander serves for 
filtering hquids from solids, e.g.^ the vegetables from the 
w^ater in which they have been boiled ; a tin gravy -strainer 
serves to eliminate smaller particles from roast gravies ; a 
wire sieve serves similar purposes — if its gauze be fine it 
serves like a hair-sieve ; two hair sieves of different sizes, 
with glass vessels to receive and hold them on the top, are 
necessary for the production of purees. For frying, par- 



58 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

ticularly aggregates of small objects, such as ivhitebait, 
which must be dipped simultaneously and withdrawn 
suddenly, a loire basket is requisite. Some three to six 
jelly -moulds complete the list of Hghter apparatus. 

Amongst the more comjjound apparatus we range a freez- 
ing-machine, or cooling apparatus of convenient dimensions; 
a coffee-mill; a mincing-machine for the comminution of 
meat ; a tin box with various divisions, and a set of movable 
stoppered vessels of glass or tin, for the preservation of 
spices ; a similar tin box, with stoppered bottles containing 
ready-made tinctures of spices. There should be a ivooden 
slab and a marble slab, both for the production of pastry ; 
rolling-pins of hard wood, one a plain cylinder or faggot, 
and another with central or axial pin, and two projecting 
handles at the extremities. 

Consideration of the Matsrlah of which the Utensils should 

be made. 

Vessels of copper are the most durable, and if kept bright 
cannot affect the taste or wholesomeness of the food pre- 
pared in them, even if they be not tinned — e.g., jams can 
be prepared in a large copper pan. But it is usual to get 
the small copper vessels, sauta-pans, stock-pot, saucepans, 
and pans to stand in the bain-marie, tinned ; in which case 
it is necessary to inspect them from time to time, and see 
that the tinning be perfect, for wherever it is imperfect the 
copper is much more rapidly corroded. We have also had 
copper utensils silvered by the electro-plate process; these 
utensils are of exquisite purity, but they blister at the 
same temperature nearly as that at which the tinned vessels 
part with their tin in little drops or currents, and must 
therefore not be exposed to such degrees of heat. 

Vessels of mere cast or lorought iron are good for many 
culinary operations. The best frying-pan is one of steel or 
hard iron, highly polished inside, and, we repeat emphati- 



KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS 59 

cally, kejyt ijolishecl like a mirror. Wrouglit-iroii vessels 
tinned are useful for a time, but gradually lose their tin. 
Enamelled iron ware is useful as long as the enamel is 
entire ; when this lining is cracked it becomes inconvenient, 
as difficult to keep clean. Enamelled iron is a bad con- 
ductor of heat, and in this respect resembles earthenware. 
Of enamelled iron pans, a frying-pan is least to be recom- 
mended, as it retards a process which ought to be swift and 
short, Earthemvare is very good for slow boiling or 
simmering, but it is always liable to crack, and therefore in 
the long-run more expensive than ironware. Block tin, 
being sheet-iron plated with tin, is very useful, as vessels 
made of it are light and conduct the heat well ; but they 
are liable to rust quickly, particularly at the bottom, and 
must therefore be renewed at shorter intervals than vessels 
of other materials. 

Apparatus for Keeping, Weighing, and Measuring. 

Amongst the apparatus for keeping articles of food pro- 
tected from winged insects and rodent vertebrates, ciqjboards 
with walls of perforated zinc or canvas are suitable ; also 
covers made of wire-gauze with handles are very practical. 
Ice-boxes are useful for some things, but unless they are 
very large do not admit of the preservation of raw meat 
therein for want of ventilation. 

There should be in the kitchen a number of common 
earthen or stone ware howls, two of them with lips, for 
holding broth, stock, gravy, or soup, while setting for the 
removal of fat. Supply, says ' Wyvern,' liberally all such 
utensils, as in default may be borrow^ed from your table 
crockery or porcelain, or from amongst the spoons, knives, 
and forks of the dining-room. 

Of crockery you should therefore supply : A set of jugs of 
different sizes, wide-mouthed, so that they can be easily 
cleaned with the hand and cloth in their cavity ; two cups 



6o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



and saucers for mixing or holding small quantities of liquid ; 
s,\^ plates 2Aidi ihxQQ soup plates ; two larger and two small 
dishes; two small basins, to serve under the wire covers 
already described. Most of this crockery would be kept 
mainly in the larder. A cupboard with shelves, to be 
locked by a key, should be at the command of the cook. 

The apparatus for iceigliing and measuring should com- 
prise : 

A spring steel-yard weighing up to 150 lb. 

A balance or iveigliing -machine capable of weighing parcels, 
joints, etc., up to 21 lb., turning at less than half an ounce. 

A balance capable of w^eighing quantities from 2 lb. down 
to a drachm, and turning with a grain. 

A set of weights in iron or brass, avoirdupois, from 21. lb. 
downwards. 

A set of loeights in brass only, for the second fine balance. 

A set of kilogram weights from 1 kilo down to 1 gram 
will be a great convenience for comparison, or for the prac- 
tical execution of French recipes. 

Of measures of capacity there should be a icoodcn bushel 
and its subdivisions ; a gallon, quart, pint, and gill measure 
of copper, tin, peicter, or of glass, verified. 

There should be a good clock in the kitchen, with a large 
dial and conspicuous hands, and it should be kept in good 
order and well regulated. 

The washing of the kitchen utensils, dishes, and plates is 
to be done in ivooden vessels only. Supply crystalhzed 
washing soda, and a sufficiency of cloths for wiping the 
apparatus dry ; insist upon the cloths being dried, and kept 
dry after use, or upon being changed to avoid the greasy or 
soapy flavour of over-used unclean moist cloths, which easily 
adheres to dishes and plates. 

Make an inventory of the property ; register in this, and 
hand over to the cook, only such apparatus as is eiitire and 
perfect for use. Mark chips ; do not count any cracked 



KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS 6i 

crockery. Hold a review of all articles once a quarter by 
the light of the inventory. ' Wyvern ' desires that we should 
hold a weekly inspection of cooking utensils, and make 
liberal allowance for breakage, but be severe about con- 
cealment. 

Culinary Axioms, or General Presumptions and Rules, which 
Cooks are expected to know and observe. 

All quantities of materials prescribed for use in dishes to 
be prepared being relative, may or must be varied pro- 
portionately according to the number of persons for whose 
use the dish is intended. 

All dishes, before being sent to table, must be arranged 
in the most careful, neat, elegant, and therefore pleasing 
manner. To obtain a fuller insight into the various small 
arts which may be employed for that purpose, cooks may 
consult the works of Careme. 

Salting and spicing are to be effected with such caution 
that the diners may never be inconvenienced by excess, but 
may be able themselves to supply every want detected in 
this particular by their taste. But this precaution really 
applies only to the population of season-residents and 
floating season-cooks, for in an established reasonable 
household a prudent permanent cook will quickly adapt 
himself to the taste of his governors, and please them with 
facility. 

All made preparations must be tasted during their pro- 
gress, and, if possible, before being served, or at certain 
critical stages — e.g., before volumes of solid are mixed with 
liquid, as is the case when mince is immersed in sauce for 
the production of an aspic. Most kinds of meat, and all 
vegetables, must be cleaned, washed, dried, and dressed 
before being used in culinary operations. It is therefore 
not necessary to repeat the injunction of this operation in 
every single prescription. 



62 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



All stirring is to be effected with wooden S2)007is, or 
spaUdas, except where directed otherwise — e.g., in the case 
of the contents of broken eggs, which are to be mixed and 
stirred by a broom made of wire. 

The juice and imlp of lemons, siveet and hitter oranges, 
are to be kept entirely free from pips or seeds, as these 
impart a bitter and objectionable taste to the product. 

Apples not used entire are to be peeled, and all parts of 
the seed'Capsule, or core, are to be entirely removed. 

Baisins not expressly commanded to be used whole, and 
not being sultanas, are to be stoned, so as to be absolutely 
free from kernels or seeds. All raisins should either be 
plumped in a minimum of hot water, or be boiled or stewed 
with the preparation in which they are to be eaten, so that 
their skins may be quite tender. 

Baisins or currants should not be put on the top of baked 
puddings or tarts, where they are liable to be shrivelled 
and burnt. 

All currants are to be picked on a sheet of paper, beiog 
spread over the sheet in a thin layer ; more particularly all 
small stones are to be removed, as these are liable to injure 
the teeth of eaters. Sand and other impurities are to be 
removed by washing. 

Bice also must be spread on paper and inspected to remove 
small ivhite stones, which, derived partly from the mill- 
stones under which it is peeled, are frequently contained in 
it ; it must also be washed in several waters to remove sand. 

Beef and other suet must be fresh and untainted, and 
should always be tested by the smell immediately before 
use. 

Eggs, after being broken, should be tested singly by the 
smell, and the yolks, as well as the whites, when used 
separately, should each be so tested before being mixed 
with others. A single mouldy egg will spoil a voluminous 
dish. 



KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CUIINARY AXIOMS 63 

All fish is to be scalded, scaled, drawn, cleansed, and 
trimmed before use in the recipes, except where modifications 
are expressly prescribed. 

Kemove all hoiled fish immediately from the w^ater in 
which it has been cooked ; if it be left in the water it will 
lose in flavour and firmness. 

Do not send jjZai?^ hoiled fish to table on a napkin, nor 
garnished round with cold and wet parsley, nor with fried 
small fish ; the latter generally becomes sodden and spoiled, 
while the mixed vapours rising from both kinds of fish are 
detrimental to the flavour of each. 

Nutmeg is never used in any other form except the grated 
condition ; it is therefore not necessary, in recipes, to use 
the participle * grated ' as an adjective every time that 
nutmeg is mentioned. 

Founding is always done in a mortar ; it is therefore not 
necessary in recipes always to mention this receptacle in 
connection with pounding. 

Never pour cold or hot loater into a dry, hot cast-iron, 
])orcelain, or earthen vessel, as it is liable to crack; kt 
the vessel cool down before putting the liquid into it. 
Copper vessels are the least liable to injury by this ill- 
treatment, wrought-iron ones also little ; but cast-iron 
saucepans are easily cracked ; cold porcelain (china) and 
earthenware vessels are also liable to crack by the sudden 
contact with hot liquids or with fiame. Therefore warm 
all such vessels gradually, either with the cold liquid in 
them, or before putting hot liquid into them. 

We might multiply these aphoristic cautions and axioms, 
but prefer to recite any others which are now in our mind's 
eye in connection with the detail out of which they arise. 



64 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



CHAPTER IV. 

GENERAL CONSIDERATION OF CULINARY PRO- 
CESSES. 

Boilin?, Baking, Roasting, Frying, Grilling. 

Boiling is the application of heat to natural products or 
compounds intended to be eaten by means of direct contact 
with water heated to the degree of ebullition, and kept at 
or near that degree until the food be cooked. In the con- 
sideration of this process two influences have to be separately 
valued, namely, that of the heat merely, such as can be 
applied and studied in the processes of roasting and baking, 
and that of the hot loater as a chemical agent and solvent. 
When the latter influence prevails, it generally effects such 
a transformation that the process of boiling becomes one of 
extraction or of solution. This prevalence has, therefore, to 
be avoided, for the best boiling is that which causes to the 
matter to be boiled the least loss of its useful and nutritive 
constituents. Now, as all boiling causes such a loss, that 
mode of boiling which causes the least loss is the best. 
From this it follows that, as the loss is in a direct proportion 
to the solvent employed, all boihng should be effected in a 
minimum of water. In practice, tioo degrees of boiling are 
distinguished, one called boiling absolutely, and another 
lower one called simmering. In both cases the water is, at 
the average pressure of the air at the sea-level, at the 
temperature of 100° Centigrade or 212° Fahrenheit. But in ' 
the water boiling violently heat is conveyed much quicker 
than in the water which merely simmers. Now, as many 
materials which have to be cooked are bulky, and bad con- 
ductors of heat, they should, in order to become equably 
cooked, not be exposed to the inlluence of water in strong 



CULINARY PROCESSES 65 

ebullition, but merely to such as is in the state of simmering. 
This latter operation must be continued for the time which 
may be necessary to cook the material throughout, and this 
time can be ascertained only by experience. 

In boiling materials for the table, the cook must take 
especial care that the water really boils or simmers all the 
while he is cooking, or he will be deceived in time."^ Now, 
as for the complete cooking of meat or vegetables, the tem- 
perature of 100° C. or 212° F. is by no means necessary, 
and as they can be cooked to complete maturity at a tem- 
perature much below boiling water, it follows that cooks 
adopt the boiling or simmering only as a visible, easily 
ascertainable sign of their having a sufficiently quic'k source 
of heat at work for the accomplishment of the object. If a 
slower source of heat be allowed to influence the material to 
be cooked, but for a longer j^eriod of time, the same — nay, a 
better — result will be obtained. This is proved by the 
Norwegian method of heating a joint just to ebullition, and 
then placing it, closely covered, in the vessel with the water, 
in a non-conducting felt box, and leaving it here for many, 
say six, hours; after that time the meat is found perfectly 
cooked, and very juicy. This method, therefore, is doubly 
economical ; it saves trouble, fuel, and time, and produces 
an excellent result. 

The Cooking of Eggs. — Hitherto, perhaps, no product of 
the kitchen prepared by boiling was more uncertain than 
that called soft-boiled eggs. These agreeable adjuvants of 
the breakfast and tea table produced frequent disappoint- 
ments to either those who liked them more or to those who 
liked them less done. Time-keepers, sand-glasses, knack, 
and experience were alike frequently defeated, until now 
at last an apparatus has been invented which will cook eggs 
to a desirable degree, and does not allow them to be over- 

* Cf. Kitcbiner, loc. cit., p. 71, and p. 73, the illustration of the two 
u.utton chops quoted below. 



66 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

done. This apparatus, called Eoyle's Egg-cooker, Whit- 
field's patent, consists of two parts : an upper one, with 
space for a number of eggs and the hot water to cook them ; 
and a lower one, for the reception of the water which runs 
off the eggs through a small aperture in the bottom of the 
egg-containing vessel. Place the eggs in the upper vessel, 
fill it with boiling water, and cover it up ; the eggs will 
become beautifully cooked throughout their substance while 
the water is around them and running away, and by the 
time they are so cooked all the water will have escaped into 
the lower vessel, and it will be impossible for the eggs to 
become overdone, while being kept hot all the same. This 
very useful apparatus proves, moreover, like the Norwegian 
apparatus, that cooking can be effected at temperatures far 
below the boiHng-point of water, and its inventor has 
properly termed it, not an egg-boiler, but an ecjcj-cooher. 

Kitchiners Tioo Mutton Chops. — Two mutton chops were 
covered with water ; one was boiled at a gallop, the other 
was simmered very gently for three-quarters of an hour. 
The chop which was slowly simmered was decidedly superior 
to that which was boiled ; it was much tenderer, more 
juicy, and much higher flavoured. The liquor which had 
boiled fast was in like proportion more savoury, and when 
cold had much more fat on its surface. Quick boiling 
extracts more of the juices, and, in fact, expels them by 
the contraction which boiUng heat engenders in the meat- 
fibre. White of egg, like meat, may be perfectly cooked 
and tender, but by reheating to boiling be made hard ; on 
the other hand, meat and eggs may be heated to the same 
temperature as that which they reached in the first cooking 
without diminution of their tender and juicy qualities. The 
knowledge and observance of this law is of the utmost 
importance to a cook, as in ordinary life many parts of 
boiled or roast meat have to be hotted, and, if properly 
done, will always be acceptable, while cooked meat made 



CULINARY PROCESSES 67 

hard by hotting to the boHing-point of the same is very- 
objectionable, and rather indigestible. Therefore, meat to 
be hotted should not be placed over the fire, but, like the 
eggs in the egg-cooker, be hotted by having the sauce, and 
this boiling hot, poured over it in a previously well-warmed 
vessel. A saucepan standing in a water-bath is the most 
suitable receptacle. 

Some Special Considerations regarding the Boiling of Meat. 
— The boihng of meat gives rise to various considerations, 
which have to be treated practically in the preliminary con- 
sideration of the different materials. Only few are suffi- 
ciently general to be mentioned in this place. Thus, the 
question is frequently asked whether meat to be boiled 
should be put in cold, hot, or boiling water, and has been as 
variously answered. On the whole evidence it may be con- 
tended that it does not matter much what temperature the 
water may possess when it comes in contact with the meat, 
provided all other conditions of good coction be observed, 
such as minimum of water and slow conveyance of heat. 
All meat will yield a little dissolved albumin to water, less 
to hot than cold. This albumin, as well as the red colour- 
ing-matter of fresh red meat, myoclirome, will curdle on 
cooking, and have to be removed as scimi. This rising of 
the scum when the pot is coming to a boil will always occur 
with the cleanest meat and the clearest water, but both the 
meat and the water (if the latter be chalky) will contribute 
materials to its formation ; if distilled water be employed, 
the materials of the scum are furnished by the meat only. 
Skimming will, therefore, have to be done whether the meat 
be put on the fire in cold or in hot water. It is done best 
at a temperature below boiling, for experienced cooks first 
skim during boiling, and then stop the boiling for a moment 
by the addition of a little cold water, and during this period 
of quiescence the remainder of the scum rises to the surface 
and is removed by the skimmer. It is preferable to put 



68 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

small j)kcc8 of meat well tied together in hot water, heat to 
ebullition, and then let the meat cook to the point at a heat 
below boiling. Large 2yieces of meat, on the contrary, should 
be put on with cold water, to allow the heat gradually to 
penetrate their substance, and then be kept simmering as 
will be found prescribed in the particular recipes relating to 
such joints. 

In this discussion it is assumed that the production of 
the best meat obtainable is the main object of the process, 
and that the production of broth be not a consideration to 
which the quality of the meat has to make any concession. 

The time during which meat ought to be boiled is generally 
estimated in the following manner : Do not reckon the time 
which elapses between the putting of the meat on the fire 
and its first coming to a boil ; after the first ebullition has 
taken place allow twenty minutes for every pound of fresh, 
and rather more to every pound of salt meat, and confine 
the action of the cooking pot to simmering. 

Freshly -hilled meat will take much more time to become 
eatable by boihng than meat which has been kept hung till 
it is what butchers term ripe. On the treatment of fresh- 
killed beef, compare what will be found below in the chapter 
on * Camp Cookery,' regarding an ox which was killed at 
11 a.m., and half eaten by 1 p.m. Meat will have to be 
boiled a little longer in cold than in tvarm weather, although 
the temperature of the air makes less difference in this 
process than in that of roasting. Frozen meat must be 
thaiued before it is put on for either boihng or roasting, and 
in cold weather meat should be put in a warmer room or 
kitchen a few hours before being put to or over the fire. 

Meat, whether it be boiled or roasted, loses during cooking 
from one-fifth to one-third of its whole weight. 28 pieces 
of beef, weighing 280 lb., lost in boiling 73 lb. 14 oz., or 
26^ per cent. ; 19 pieces of beef, weighing 190 lb., lost in 
roasting 61 lb. 2 oz., or 32 per cent. ; 9 pieces of beef, 



CULINARY PROCESSES 69 



weighing 901b., lost in baking 271b., or 32 per cent. ; 27 legs 
of mutton, weighing 270 lb., lost in boiling 55 lb. 8 oz., or 
21|- per cent. ; 35 shoulders of mutton, weighing 350 lb., 
lost in roasting 109 lb. 10 oz., or 31 J per cent. ; 16 loins of 
mutton, weighing 111 lb., lost in roasting 49 lb. 14 oz., or 
35 J per cent. ; 10 necks of mutton, weighing 100 lb., lost in 
roasting 32 lb. 6 oz., or 32 J per cent."^ 

This loss in each form of preparation is mainly due to the 
exudation of toater from the meat, while it loses its colloid 
protoplastic constitution, in which it contains about 75 per 
cent, of water ; another portion of the loss consists in fat, 
and only a small portion in extractives and salts, constituting 
the solid ingredients of broth or gravy. In the process of 
boiling some gelatine also is lost by solution ; in roasting, 
however, very little, more from veal than from beef. 

Baking. — Baking may be defined as cooking by a combina- 
tion of radiated and air-conducted heat ; if the oven be well 
ventilated, as bakers' ovens generally are, the preparations 
retain a very pure taste, are first cooked in moisture, then 
dried, and ultimately browned on the outside. Upon meat 
baking has about the same effect as roasting, and produces 
in it a similar loss. If the preparation placed in the oven 
for baking be covered, the effect is the same as that pro- 
duced by braising, namely, cooking in a moist atmosphere, 
under the simultaneous influence of dark radiating heat, 
capable of browning surfaces and transforming extractives 
into brown anhydrides or cara7nels. 

Baking! is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways 
of dressing a dinner for small families ; the baker's oven'is, 
indeed, often the only kitchen a poor man has in which to 

* The losses in weight of meat in roasting and boiling are given accord- 
ing to experiments recorded in Tilloch's Philosophical Magazine. 

f The observations on baking in a baker's oven are ex Kitchiner, ' Oracle,' 
p. 77 ; they were written specially for this work by a baker of the name of 
Turner, who, about 1830, carried on a distinguished business near Fitzroy 
Square. ' He w as in the habit,' he says, ' of baking legs and shins of beef, 
ox-cheeks, etc., garnished with onions, turnips, etc., for the first families.' 



70 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

prepare a joint of meat for enjoyment at home with his 
family. In general, roasting must be admitted to yield 
results superior to those of baking, but some joints when 
baked so nearly approach to the same when roasted, that 
they may be eaten as roasts with satisfaction. Such are 
legs and loins of xiorh, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and 
many others. The meat should be good, and rather inclined 
to be fat. Very lean meat is unsuitable for baking, as it 
starts from the bone and shrivels up in a remarkable 
manner. Besides the joints mentioned, the following dishes 
may be particularly recommended for baking. They are 
protected from the drying which threatens lean meat by 
coverings of oiled or greased (buttered) paper, or by paste, 
and then their cooking becomes equivalent to braising. 

A suching jng, when sent to the baker prepared for baking, 
should have its ears and tail covered with buttered paper 
properly fastened on, and a bit of butter tied up in a piece 
of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it will be apt to 
blister. 

A goose prepared in the same manner as for roasting 
should be placed on a stand, so that when it is half done it 
may be turned with its lower side upwards. A duck should 
be similarly treated. 

A buttock of beef, having been in salt for about a week, 
should be washed and put into a brown earthen pan with a 
pint of water or broth. Cover the pan tightly over with 
two or three thicknesses of cap or foolscap paper — never 
cover anything that is to be baked with broion paper, the 
pitch and tar in which will give to the meat a smoky bad 
taste — and give it four or five hours' baking in a moderately 
heated oven. 

A ham, properly soaked, as directed below, may be 
covered with a crust of paste all over, and baked in a 
moderately heated oven ; it is as full of gravy and of as fine 
a flavour as a boiled one. 



CULINARY PROCESSES 71 

The following fish can also be baked : Small cod, haddoch, 
or mackerel, with a dust of flour and a basting of butter 
over them ; eels, when large and stuffed ; herrings in a 
brown pan with vinegar and a little spice, and tied over 
with paper. 

A hare, prepared as for roasting, basted with butter 
repeatedly, and placed in a pan with a little milk, will 
become nicely done. It may also be cut up and placed in a 
vessel and jugged. Legs and shins of beef, ox-cheeks, etc., 
garnished with onions, turnips, etc., take about four hours 
to cook ; they are then allowed to get cool to have the fat 
skimmed off, after which they are warmed again and 
served. 

Baking in the small ovens of kitchens is not so successful 
as that in the baker's oven. This arises in most cases from 
the faulty construction of the ovens, which, as we have 
already shown above, are mainly heated from the side, and 
have either no bottom heat at all or not enough of it. 
Further, most of these ovens are not ventilated, so that the 
fat which spirts on hot parts of the oven or dish, on being 
volatilized, taints the meat with its burnt grease taste, due 
to acroleine. Some cooks do not take sufficient care to 
clean, and keep clean, the oven, which is not rarely littered 
with charcoal, particularly that formed by the burning of 
overflowing fruit- juice from fruit-pies. On this particular 
subject masters and mistresses of private houses cannot 
bestow too much attention. 

The construction of ovens for baking has of late years 
undergone considerable modification. Amongst professed 
bakers and confectioners brick ovens are still most esteemed, 
as they allow many varying degrees of heat to be applied 
successively, or in different parts of the oven to very 
difl'erent preparations. But for special trades ovens of iron 
have been constructed which are provided with movable 
trays, enabling the baker to bring the component items of 



72 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

the charge simultaneoasly into as well as out of the oven. 
These are also provided with i^yrometers, or heat-measuring 
instruments, and thus yield very good results. We have 
seen them adapted to ships of several kinds, and to field- 
hakeries for soldiers. Brick ovens, being heated from the 
inside, exhibit the sufficiency of their heating by the clear- 
ing of the surface from black soot, and once charged with 
preparations to be baked, cannot be heated again until the 
charge be withdrawn ; but iron ovens are heated from the 
outside, like those of most kitcheners, and can be heated 
and reheated without regard to the contents of their interior. 
They are also a little more economical, as they are heated 
more quickly, and consume less coal or wood than the brick- 
ovens. 

A general princijyle of baking is that tlie oven must be 
sufficiently hot at the moment at which the preparations to 
be baked are introduced into it ; they must experience the 
same surprise as that which articles to be fried meet with 
when they are immersed into the hot fat. An indifferently 
heated oven does not cause the" preparations to rise, but 
drying them leaves them of a pale colour, which is objec- 
tionable in many products. 

Roasting. — Eoasting is that culinary operation in which 
the English excel all other nations. It consists in bringing 
a joint of meat, or a small animal, so near to a clear fire 
that it may become cooked, and ultimately browned over its 
surface, and thus acquire that taste and savour by which 
roast meat excels all other forms of preparation of flesh- 
food. Meat was formerly most commonly roasted on the 
spit, a sword- or bayonet-like instrument, which was run 
through the joint, then supported on two forks, and kept 
turning before the fire. In the present day, however, a 
small instrument, the so-called roasting-jack, or from its 
external shape called bottle-jack, is in prevalent use ; it is 
wound up like a clock, and turns the meat suspended at its- 



CULINARY PROCESSES 73 

lower end, first in one and then in an opposite direction 
with great precision ; the heat is condensed upon the meat 
by a parabolic screen of tin-plate ; the whole constitutes an 
effectual arrangement for joints up to 22 lb., provided the 
jack be of sufficient size and power. 

Smaller pieces of meat, such as heef or rum'p steaks, chops, 
and fish, have to be roasted on an instrument called a grill, 
an originally French name for a frame made of crossed or 
parallel bars, and hence meat so done is called grilled. In 
this process of grilhng most of the gravy which exudes is 
lost, but this is not much, as the meat retains the greater 
part and is most juicy. 

There are many rules given, and no doubt to be observed, 
in connection with roasting, from the cleaning of the spit to 
the hanging of the meat and the preparing of the fire ; of 
these the latter ones are of the first importance. Make up 
the fire in time, let it be proportioned to the dinner to be 
dressed, and about 4 inches longer at each end than the 
thing to be roasted, and let its front be clear; take care 
that the coal be in its first glow, and not burnt up or ashy. 
Keep a supply of coals and cinders on the top ; an excess of 
heat you can neutralize by increasing a little the distance 
between the meat and the fire, but an insufficient fire will 
torture the meat into a cooked leathery state, and not 
produce either the juiciness or brown savour of the true 
roast. 

If there be on the joint to be roasted more fat than will 
probably be eaten, trim it off; that which remains on protect 
with a piece of clean ivliite imper drenched in oil or dripping, 
and tied on with twine ; in the same manner protect any 
prominent part which is liable to become, or shows signs of 
becoming, scorched; a shoulder of veal, e.g., requires such 
protection particularly on all prominent parts. Fish and 
small birds may also be protected entirely by being wrapped 
in -paper {en pajjillote), while others may be covered with 



74 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

thin slices of bacon, to be removed shortly before the outside 
is finished. 

All meat should at first be put at some distance, sa^^ from 
10 to 14 inches, always a little greater than that at which 
it is ultimately to be roasted, from the fire, in order that it 
may be warmed gradually to such a degree as will cause it 
to exude fat and gravij over its surface before that surface 
has had time to become scorched by the radiating heat ; if 
once it gets scorched, the outside will become hard and 
acquire a disagreeable taste, and the heat being prevented 
by the scorched part from penetrating into it, the meat will 
appear done before it is more than half done, and will 
besides lose the pale-brown colour which is the beauty of 
roast meat and the certain guarantee of its excellent taste. 

As regards the management of the driiJiying the following 
rules should be observed :* Place the dripinng-imn at such 
a distance from the fire that it will just catch the dripping ; 
if it be too near, some ashes or cinders will fall into it ; if it 
be too far from the fire, you will not only lose a portion of 
the drippings, but the meat will be blackened and spoiled 
by the foetid smoke which will arise when the fat falls on 
the live cinders. A large dripping-pan, some 28 inches long, 
20 inches wide, with a covered well on the side away from 
the fire, is convenient not only for collecting the dripping, 
but it also may hold fried fish and other dishes to keep them 
hot while waiting to be served. If there be much dripping 
during the roasting, the cook should take up the fat top 
occasionally and pass it through a sieve into a stone pot. 
After it has been cooled, and the gravy been removed from 
under it, it may be clarified by being heated in a saucepan, 
skimmed, let boil, allowed to stand until cool while yet 
liquid, and then passed through a sieve into a pan. Such 
drii)2nngs, as well as the fat skimmings of the brotJi-jJot, will 
be as suitable as butter for basting any roasts, except game 

* Vide 'Dripping'; Kitchiner, loc. cit., pp. 81, 148. 



CULINARY PROCESSES 75 

and poultry, and for common fries ; for these latter they are 
equal to lard, especially if they be clarified twice over. 

A good meat-screen is essential for the success of roasting. 
Its inside must be kept scrupulously polished, as when in 
the shghtest degree covered by grease, or scorched gravy, it 
fails in its object, namely, the central reverberation of the 
heat, which is not thrown directly upon the joint. You 
must therefore make it a rule to inspect the meat-screen as 
well as the frying-pans and gridirons from time to time, 
and make sure that they be kept in a iJolishecl^ bright con- 
dition. 

The time occujned by the roasting of meat will vary accord- 
ing to the period during which it has been hung, the tem- 
perature of the air, and the size of the joint, amount of fire, 
and distance from it being normal. In cold weather the 
same weight will require twenty minutes or half an hour 
longer than in warm, and fresh-killed meat will also be done 
as much later than that which has been kept until it was 
tender. When you have secured all conditions as set forth 
in the foregoing, you should leave the meat before the fire 
rather, more titan a quarter of an hour for every imund of its 
ivcighty and baste it so as to keep its surface soft and mellow 
all over. When the joint is half done, remove it with the 
apparatus on which it is fixed, spit, or jack and screen, 
and dripping-pan, a little back from the fire, stir this up 
thoroughly, that it may burn clear for the browning ; when 
the steam from the meat draws towards the fire, the joint 
is done enough, and should be moved back. If you wish to 
froth it, baste it, and dredge it carefully all over with flour, 
in a very thin layer indeed, and then heat it rapidly until 
the froth has risen. For this operation you require to 
have a good light on the joint. The froth should be like a 
fine light-brown varnish. Some cooks produce the final 
froth after removal of the joint from the fire, by painting it 
with butter, dredging it cautiously with flour, and passing 



76 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

a salamander over it. This in exp3rienced hands is a certain 
and expeditious method. 

In the face of all the conditions of roasting, and the con- 
sequent uncertainty of its duration, the public who consult 
cookery-books demand, and cuhnary authors give generally, 
exact statements regarding the time absorbed by each roast. 
Gouffe gives a list (p. 108) which he properly says is de- 
pendent for its accuracy on the absence even of a draught 
of air. 

A piece of roast beef of 3 lb. takes an hour before the fire. 

A leg of mutton of 5 lb., forty-five minutes. 

A carre of veal of 5 lb., fifty minutes. 

A carre of fresh pork of the same weight, the same time. 

A fat turkey of about 4 lb., an hour and forty minutes. 

A small turkey hen of 3 lb. in weight, forty-five minutes. 

A goose of the same weight, same time of cooking. 

A poularde of 4 lb., five minutes. 

A poulet of 3 lb., thirty minutes. 

A young pigeon, fifteen minutes. 

A pheasant, thirty-five minutes. 

A partridge or woodcock, fifteen minutes. 

Larks, before a lively fire, six minutes. 

A wild duck, fifteen minutes. 

A farmyard duck, fifteen minutes. 

A young hare, thirty minutes. 

A baron or back (rdble) of hare, thirty minutes. 

A young rabbit (laj^ereaic), fifteen minutes. 

He directs two decilitres of bouillon to be placed in the 
gravy-well at the beginning of the roasting, in order to baste 
therewith the large joints five or six times during the pro- 
cess, the partridges and small game three times. He 
diagnoses the completed coction by pressing the finger 
strongly on the object, the nut of the joints, or the thigh 
of the birds. When the meat is cooked, it yields under- 
neath the finger without any resistance. 

Brillat Savarin has a characteristic aphorism, according to 



CULINARY PROCESSES 77 

which a cook might become an expert in frying by tuition, 
but that to become a roaster he must be born a genius with 
an instinct for the spit. On pent devenir friturier, on est nS 
rotisseur, runs the paraphrase of Horace. We beheve that 
innate talent, good practical instruction, the knowledge and 
observance of all the conditions of success, may combine to 
produce a superior artist, but that no one need despair of 
producing good roasts who will intelligently and energetically 
obey and carry out the instructions contained in the fore- 
going, combined with the results of this special deliberation 
on details arising in the course of the roasting. 

In case the roast be from any cause deficient in colour, 
this may be supplied by painting it with some hotted glaze 
prepared beforehand. If you require to increase the volume 
of gravy, do not dilute what you have, but produce some by 
an extra operation, according to the relative recipe below, 
from fried mince and standard broth. The common method 
of washing the corners and underside of the joint, and 
maybe the canal made by the spit, with a solution of a 
teaspoonful of salt in a quarter-pint of boiling water, or of 
pricking the underside of the joint with a sharp skewer, are 
all effected at the cost of the quality of the joint. Gravy 
for roast heef should not be mixed with any made sauce, 
but gravy for roast veal may be suitably diluted with melted 
butter or butter sauce. 

Dredgmg and Basting. — As a proof that our ancestors 
were very particular in basting and dredging joints before 
and during roasting, we give a list of dredgings and 
bastings,''' as used two and a half centuries ago. 

Dredgings. 

1. Flour mixed with grated bread. 

2. Sweet herbs dried and powdered, and mixed with 
grated bread. 

* Vide 'Gravy for Roast Veal": Kitchiner, loc. cit., p. 243; list of 
' Diedgiiigd,' ix Kitchiner, p. 84, ex May's ' Accomplished Cook.' London, 
1865, p. 136. 



78 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



3. Leinon-peel dried and pounded, or orange-peel mixed 
with flour. 

4. Sugar finely powdered, and mixed with pounded 
cinnamon and flour or grated bread. 

5. Fennel-seeds, corianders, cinnamon and sugar, finely 
beaten and mixed with grated bread and flour. 

6. For young pigs, grated bread and flour, mixed with 
beaten nutmeg, ginger, pepper, sugar, and yolks of eggs. 

7. Sugar, bread, and salt mixed. 

Bastings. 

1. Fresh butter. 

2. Clarified suet. 

3. Minced sweet herbs, butter and claret, especially for 
mutton and lamb. 

4. Water and salt. 

5. Cream and melted butter, especially for flayed pigs. 

6. Yolks of eggs, grated biscuits, and juice of oranges. 
Some of these dredgings would greatly improve shoulders 

of veal and mutton; the French improve upon tliem by 
covering a shoulder of veal with a layer of farce. At pre- 
sent, in the majority of English kitchens, sufficient care is 
not bestowed upon the finishing of the outside of the roasts, 
which remain membranous, tough, and uneatable; some 
dredging, basting, and the passage of the salamander, will 
quickly change all this into a frothed, crumbhng mass, 
penetrated by brown gravy, and heighten the taste of the 
meat, thus putting the finishing touch to the best roasting. 
The particularly fine savour of roast meat and its gravy 
is produced by the browning of concentrated osmazom, the 
organic principle of extract of meat, as will be discussed 
more fully in subsequent paragraphs. 

As regards the process of frying we refer the reader to 
Chapter XXI. below, where a general consideration of 
the theory is given. The term hroiling, or grilling, is ap- 
pUed to the roasting before the open fire of smaller and 



CULINARY PROCESSES 79 



thinner pieces of meat, such as clio^^s and steaks. The 
description of this method is contained in the general con- 
sideration preceding a subsequent chapter, and may be there 
perused. The French grill over a horizontal plane made 
of ashes covered with live braise, which projects on all sides 
3 inches beyond the grill, placed horizontally on four 
short legs over the braise ; the English grill on a gridiron 
suspended perpendicularly before the fire, or slanting up- 
wards parallel with the deflected flame. 

An entre-cote of three hectograms in weight, or a little 
more than half a pound, when trimmed, requires ten minutes 
for grilling ; trimmed beefsteak of less than half a pound 
requires seven minutes before a moderate fire. 

A trimmed mutton cutlet {cm naturel), which weighs 
generally 125 grammes, requires six minutes before a lively 
fire. 

A split kidney requires four minutes of active fire. 

A veal cutlet, weighing two-fifths of a pound, requires 
nine minutes of moderate firing. 

A pork cutlet au naturel the same. 

A crumbed mutton cutlet requires a mild fire and a minute 
more of time. It is more easily done in a pan. The same 
holds good of the crumbed veal and pork cutlets, which 
require two minutes more time than those which are not 
crumbed. 

Typical Forms of Dishes, or Sauces and Ragouts, as Means 
of Generftlization — Definition of French Surnames of 
Dishes. 

In France there has been developed, in a manner which 
should be investigated as part of the history of culture, a 
habit of cooks to give names to dishes which at the time of 
the inception of the practice had some connection with their 
origin, nature, and peculiarity. Gradually the newly-coined 
names lost all meaning, and became a means for gratifying 



8o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

small ambitions for innovation, the practice degenerating, 
as Dumas says, into fantaisics de saucer, de mettre siir Ic 
gril, et de /aire rotir nos grands hommes.'^ A number of 
names are quite natural by the fact that the dishes which 
they indicate are derived from certain countries, nation- 
alities, provinces or towns, such as a VAnglaise, a la Fran- 
caise, a la Provencale, or a la Bomaiiie ; there were also the 
names of a few patrons of the culinary art, under whose 
influence certain products had been invented, such as a la 
Bechamel or a la Bicliclieu. In all these names the ex- 
pression is really the result of an ellipse, meaning originally 
a la maniere Anglaise, or a la maniere ijatronisis jm)' M. le 
Marquis de Bdchamel, or le Marechal de Bichelieu. Such a 
nomenclature has its conveniences, and becomes very useful 
when it is accepted as the symbol of typical preparations, 
and adhered to by convention as unchangeable. But when 
the names are abused in the manner in which we shall 
show below that the expression cotelcttes a la Maintenon is 
abused or misused by French cooks, of whom almost each 
has his own formula for a dish of that name, which differs 
greatly as regards external features from the formulae of his 
neighbours, they lose all significance, and had better be 
omitted. It is therefore necessary to make a selection from 
the great number of such names occurring in literature, and 
to retain only those which are symbols of typical forms of 
dishes, and on the other hand to reject all those which are 
neither attached to typical preparations nor recognised by 
convention over a large area. Many apparent names of 
dishes are mere adjectives derived from sauces, with which 
the dishes are to be graced, and have no reference to the 
joint or piece of meat to which they are attached ; these 
also, if derived /ro??i standard sauces, should be retained.

CI ^LINAR\ ' PROCESSES 8i 

We will now review a number of culinary names which 
have something like general circulation, and can be used 
for generalization in such a mode that many different 
materials when prepared in the typical manner may bear 
the same surname. This kind of nomenclature has the 
additional advantage that it aids in the classification of 
dishes and of the recipes for them, which would otherwise 
be, as in cookery-books they always were, mere items in an 
incoherent unorganized collection. 

A VAncjlaise generally implies that the dish is roast or 
boiled in the plainest manner, or is prepared in a manner 
peculiar to this country without necessarily being plain ; 
thus, hare soup is specifically English, and in French 
cookery-books bears the surname as properly as does the 
roast sirloin. 

A Vltalie-nne generally implies that the dish is made of, 
or garnished with, savoury macaroni, or paste of that kind, 
or with ravioli, or is made savoury with Parma cheese. Of 
this wide expression, the surnames derived from Italian 
towns, such as a la Milanaise, d la Florentine, a la Napo- 
litaine, etc., are mere subordinate variations of no particular 
significance. 

A la Francaise is, curiously enough, a surname which is 
applied to the least typical preparations, some of them not 
rarely the result of a fanciful eclecticism. It should be 
more and more specialized and retained for the many 
exquisitely French preparations which, like omelettes, iKites, 
and cotelettes, are distinctly autochthonous in France. 

The French themselves love to surname dishes after 
some peculiarities favoured in the ancient provinces ; thus 
we get : 

A la Provenqale, which generally means a dish prepared 
with more or less of olive-oil, and flavoured with garlic ; 
not rarely both ingredients are used at the same time. 

A la Pdrigord is applied to dishes flavoured with or con- 

6 



82 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

sisting of truffles, from the circumstance that these mush- 
rooms grow in that province of excellent size and quality. 

A la Normande generally indicates that ai^ples enter into 
the composition of the dish in some shape or other : to this 
rule the matelote only makes an exception, which is a fish- 
racjoiU of which a particular modification is popular in 
Normandy. 

A la DauiMnoise generally implies that a dish is braised, 
sauced over with a thick sauce, crumbed, and perhaps sauced 
or egged and crumbed twice over, and then fried. This 
surname was originally derived from the Dauj^hinee, and not 
from the Dauphin, a royal crown-prince of France, as has 
been erroneously supposed by those who have termed 
analogously prepared dishes a la Boyale, etc. This latter 
expression possesses no specific significance at all. 

A la Bourguignotte generally signifies a dish prepared 
with the addition of red wine of Burgundy , or of Bordeaux^ 
or of the Midi — i.e., meridional provinces of France. At 
Bordeaux, or when made elsewhere with Gironde wine, the 
dish would of course bear the surname a la Bordelaise. 

Surnames derived from French towns are numerous, but 
not very significant, thus : 

A la Parisienne is applied to dishes which are generally 
luxuriously prepared, and overladen with expensive gar- 
nishes, as will be demonstrated by several examples lower 
down ; but they possess little or no specificity. 

The French kitchen has some exquisitely descriptive 
and well-understood surnames, which ought to be main- 
tained, as being generally adopted ; such are the following : 
A la jardiniere — this signifies a typical collection of 
cooked vegetables given in soups, ragouts, and removes. 

A la printaniere also implies a typical collection of 
cooked early vegetables, but has, contrary to origin, a some- 
what wider application than the foregoing. 

A la mackloine is also applied to typical collections of 



CULINARY PROCESSES 83 

green vegetables, mostly in white sauce ; it includes collec- 
tions of ripe fruit imbedded in jellies. Such a dish may be 
called a macedoine simply, as a dish of vegetables may also 
be termed a jardiniere ; on the other hand, a iwintanihre 
is not usual. 

A la maitre d'hotel generally signifies a dish prepared 
by a substantial, but homely, modest sort of cooking. 

A la Gerard is a surname derived from the name of a 
culinary assistant or under-cook, who, having prepared a 
dish which was to have been placed before and named 
after Madame de Maintenon (like the otherwise nondescript 
cotelettes which are made to bear her name nowadays), 
thought it not good enough to bear that name, and gave it 
his own. Hence a muddled or miscarried dish is sometimes 
sarcastically termed cl la Gerard. 

A la Soubise is generally applied to dishes which contain 
onions in quantity, or at least are strongly garnished and 
flavoured with them. 

A la Crdcy is similarly connected with carrots, particularly 
in the form of puree. 

A number of similarly specific surnames, but applicable 
only to a limited circle of dishes, occur amongst the details 
of magiric literature : 

A VAlleinande is a surname given to dishes to which 
French cooks have applied German provincial peculiarities 
of preparation. The most frequent application is to a dish 
with a garnish of sauerkraut as given with pork, or par- 
tridges, or pheasants ; oXso primes steived in loine, to German 
sweet sauce for veiiison^ or to quenelles of potatoes (cf. foot- 
note to p. 80, supra). 

A la Polonaise is applied to every effort to introduce red 

beetroot or red cabbage, their juice, colour, and taste, into 

various dishes, of which Polish ragout, or Borsch, is the type. 

A VIrlandaise is applied to dishes which contain potatoes 

in some form, in mass or as a prevailing garnish. 



84 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

A la chiioolata is the surname of dishes which contain 
an addition of the strongly-flavoured Italian sausages, or of 
the mince with which they are filled. 

A la Flamande is 'a surname given to dishes containing 
cabbage, but more particularly Brussels-si)routs. 

A VEs]oagnole is not applied to any typical dish, but to 
any preparation made savoury with the broion typical sauce 
bearing that surname. 

A la Viennoise is applied to dishes as usually and typically 
prepared in the Austrian capital, such as dumplings termed 
Nuckerln, quenelles of potatoes, and others. 

Other names of limited application should be seen in various 
paragraphs of the dictionary explanatory of culinary terms 
(Chapter LXI.). Thus, a la godiveau indicates balls made 
of mince-meat, and a body of such minced meat may be 
termed a godiveau. 

The Influence of Temporary or Permanent Abstinence from 
Certain Kinds of Food upon the Practice of Cookery. 
The early Christian associations observed the policy of 
receiving into their rules of external conduct so-called 
heathenish practices, which meant nothing and did not con- 
tradict the general dogmas. Amongst such practices they 
accepted from and through the Jews a portion of the curious 
observances of abstinence from food for short jjeriods — e.g., 
the Israelites were ordered by their religious governors to 
abstain on Midsummer Day from food and drink altogether 
as long as daylight lasted. This rule was repeated in the 
privacy of religious brotherhoods, but total abstinence for 
any period was not imposed upon the general Christian 
public by the priesthood except for mornings before the 
Communion ; for ordinary life and the mass of society the 
observance of modified or partial abstinence was invented. 
Certain days were to be marked by observances, and these 
ceremonials took the shape, not of the impracticable absti- 



CULINARY PROCESSES 85 

nence from food altogether, but that of exclusion of flesh 
food from the dietary. This rule was never imposed upon 
the Spanish people— at least, it was not compulsory in the 
Peninsula for Fridays. Some religious brotherhoods — e.g., 
the Chartists — excluded flesh food from the dietary alto- 
gether all the year round, and thus laid the foundation for 
the equivocal doctrines embodied in the system of vege- 
tarianism. The exclusion of flesh food was at first rigidly 
observed, so that all food which was derived from animals, 
such as eggs, milk, butter, cheese, lard, suet, was prohibited, 
as well as fish, flesh, aiid fowl. Gradually eggs and milk, 
with their derivates, were excluded from the prohibition, 
and fish as well as articulate animals and shell-fish were 
also set free. This latter license was physiologically irre- 
concilable with the argument against flesh, and proved 
more than anything else that the clerical rules relating to 
diet were intended more for the furnishing of the oppor- 
tunity of the exercise of despotic discipline than as 
benevolent prescriptions for the improvement of the phy- 
siological constitution. 

These rules, with their several modifications and relaxa- 
tions, have had some influence upon cookery in various 
ways. In the, first place, they conferred greater importance 
on farinaceous and vegetable dishes, and some of the latter, 
like the vegetable imdding or chartreuse, properly so-called, 
became developed to systematic perfection. The permission 
to eat fish forced the modes of treating fish in the kitchen 
to some extent upon populations, who would have other- 
wise gone without fish altogether. Farinaceous dishes 
were developed to greater perfection. In our days, at last, 
a certain number of persons have on alleged ethical grounds 
systematized abstinence from flesh food, and under the 
name of vegetarians have confined their diet to vegetable 
products, with the prudent addition, however, of milk, eggs, 
and the products derived from them. This mode of living 



86 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

has the great recoinmendation that it is much less costly 
than a diet including meat as a mainstay ; on the other 
hand, it has the disadvantage to be ]jliysiologically incom- 
jjlete, and therefore incapable of bringing the human body 
to the highest climax of its physical development, or 
keeping it in the possession of its full strength. While 
vegetarianism, like the former clerical prohibition of meat, 
might have extended somewhat the practice of vegetable 
cookery, and thus advanced it a little, it has confined itself 
to importing into its peculiar literature a number of terms 
taken from ordinary cookery, and misapplied to counter- 
feits"^ which cannot be to its credit. By a careful scrutiny 
of vegetarian literature, we have convinced ourselves that 
its recipes are, without exception, extracted from ordinary 
current cookery-books ; in no particular have we observed 
any advance, and nowhere any addition as the result of 
independent study or experiment. The alleged ethical 
motives for the avoidance of flesh food have not led to 
cBsthetical substitutes, but only to the adoption of cheap 
makeshifts, which can never supplant the products of 
rational cookery. 

CHAPTER V. 

SALINE, MINERAL, ACID, AND SWEET VEGETABLE 
CONDIMENTS; SPICES, AROMATIC SUBSTANCES 
AND HERBS ; CULINARY COLOURING MATTERS. 

Definitions. 
Condiment is usually defined in etymological works as 
that which is put along with something else to preserve or 
pickle it ; seasoning, sauce — from the Latin condimentum, 

* We quote from John Smith's 'Vegetable Cookery,' London, 1876, 
N. 454, p. 201, the following absurd definition of 'stock ': ' Stock is a term 
employed to denote that part of soup which becomes gelatinous when cold. 
For vegetable soups it is prepared from sago, tapioca, arrowroot, salop 
and Irish moss.' 



CONDIMENTS AND SPICES 87 

derived from the verb condio, I preserve or pickle. This 
definition is for our time insufficient, and with regard to 
sauce being an equivalent to condiment, obsolete. Concli- 
mcntum in Latin no doubt originally meant an aromatic 
substance capable of preserving, or helping to preserve, food 
from spoiling ; but its meaning was extended to signalize 
spice (wort, German Wilrze), a substance which makes food 
more tasty. This is also the meaning of the Greek word 
artyma. The present English use of the expression loort for 
culinary herb (or vegetable of supposed medical — i.e., heal- 
ing — virtue) corresponds to the Roman expression of condi- 
mentum viride — green culinary herb. A condimentarius at 
the time of Pliny was a spice-merchant ; he sold no green 
condiments, was not a Covent Garden herbalist, but a Great 
Tower Street pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., merchant. 
Merat and Delens in their Dictionary give the more modern 
form of definition of condiment, omitting its preservative 
functions : ' Saline, aromatic, sharp substances, etc., which 
one adds to alimentary substances in order to give them an 
agreeable taste and facilitate their digestion by stimulating 
the forces of the stomach.' This definition would unduly 
limit the term ' condiments ' to spices only. We therefore 
believe it to be expedient to unite the several definitions 
(that of sauce always excepted), and to comprise under the 
title of ' condiments ' all the saline, mineral, acid, and sweet 
vegetable substances, spices, and aromatic materials and 
herbs which are included in the classification now to be given. 
Co7Jimon salt, as the most important condiment, forms the 
first group, attended by nitre"^ ; the peppery substances form 
the second group — pepper, cava, betel, cubebs, pimento, 
unona ; the third group includes the aromatic substances 

* Nitre might be objected to as not coming under the definition ; for it 
is not added to salt either for its taste or for any supposed general pre- 
servative effect, but only as a means to retain a certain pink colour of the 
flesh, which is lost in mere salt. In this sense nitre might be termed ' a 
culinary cosmetic' 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



proper — cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, four-spices, ravendsara, 
labiates, etc. ; the fourth consists of j^avU of cruciferous 
plants — mustard, black radish, horseradish, etc. Here we 
pass into the domain of green condiments, onions, garlic, etc., 
which are not included among the substances treated of in 
this chapter, but are described in those referring to soups, 
purees and entremets, and only recapitulated in an appendix 
to the fifth group. The fifth group comprises aromatic herbs, 
falsely called savoury herbs. In the sixth group we range 
acid condiments, with vinegar as their type ; in the seventh 
group odoriferous parts of plants, not being aromatic, and 
scents extracted therefrom. The eighth group is made up 
of culinary colouring matters. The ninth and concluding 
group unites the varieties and preparations of sugar used in 
culinary operations. 

It follows from a further consideration of these data, that 
a green condiment at its season may be a seasoning, but to 
call salt a seasoning is absurd. It is equally absurd to call 
spices seasonings, and signalize their use by the factitious 
verb to season. With salt you do salt; with pepper, 
cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., you spice viands ; with green con- 
diments, such as mint, shallots, chervil, parsley, horseradish, 
you season viands. All condiments, no doubt, at the head 
of them common salt, have a strongly preservative action, 
as benumbing or killing putrefactive agents. It is by this 
action also that they are so useful to the human economy 
when introduced into the intestine in combination with 
food. 

In discussing the question of definition concerned in this 
class of materials, we have to bear in mind that the word 
herb, and its plural herbs, are used in a sense modified from 
that which is their natural meaning. More particularly in 
French culinary art the expression herbes has a restricted 
significance ; it indicates the group of culinary herbs, com- 
prising twenty-eight vegetables, which are all used as 



HISTORY OF CONDIMENTS 89 

adjuncts, while some of them are used also as substantive 
dishes. They are divided into three categories : 

First category : herbs for making soups {Jierbes lyotagcrcs). 
To this category belong sorrel, lettuce, white beet, orach (or 
goosefoot), spinach, and the green purslane (purslain). 
(Chervil is occasionally used.) 

The second category comprises herbs for flavouring, season- 
ing, or dressing (herbes cVassaisonnement), and they are ten 
in number : parsley, tarragon, chervil, chive (cive), scallion 
(eschalot or shallot), savory (satureia), fennel, thyme, 
basilicum, and tansy. 

The third category are in French termed herbes de fourni- 
ture, for which the regular English equivalent is * garnishing 
herbs.' To this category belong the garden-cress, water- 
cress, chervil, tarragon, pimpernel or burnet, samphire, 
hartshorn or coronopus, small basilicum, purslane, cor- 
dioles (heartlets) of fennel, the young balm-mint or garden- 
balm, and chives. 

Four of these herbs are at the same time herbs for making 
soups, herbs for flavouring or seasoning, and herbs for gar- 
nishing. The leaf of the laurel truly so called, commonly 
termed * bay,' although derived from a woody bush or tree, 
is also counted amongst the herbs in the sense in which 
that word is ordinarily used in culinary practice. 

Note on the History of Condiments. 

It would be instructive, as a part of the inquiry concern- 
ing the history of human culture, to follow the history of 
the origin, spread, and use of spices, which are such essential 
correctives of taste and digestion ; but there are only few 
records concerning them to be met with in historical litera- 
ture. Pe^iper, for instance, was known to the nations of 
antiquity, and used as a medicine by Hippocrates and 
Galen. Its culinary use is described by or in Apicius. It 
must have given rise to an important trade, which was 



90 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

probably in the hands of the Arabs. Amongst the booty 
which Alaric took from Eome* were three thousand pounds 
of pepper. After the conquest of the East by the Turks 
spices became much more scarce in Europe. Thus, in 1263 
Oriental spices were rare in France, for in that year the 
Abbey of St. Gilles in Languedoc made a present of some 
horns (cornets) of spice (cinnamon) to Louis le Jeune, of 
whom they were about to ask a great favour. That spices 
were highly valued as additions to food follows from the 
practice which took ground at the same time of terming 
presents made to judges, of course as bribes, sjnces. 

Spices became more accessible and more widely dis- 
tributed after the discovery of America by Columbus, and 
the route to India by Vasco de Gama, This was particu- 
larly the case with cinnamon, of which the Portuguese for a 
long time held a monopoly, and Lisbon became the centre 
of the trade in that bark. The Portuguese also first made 
cloves common throughout Europe. These had been known 
at Rome at the time of Pliny only as curiosities, and used 
for perfumes, but not then as spices in combination with 
food. 

In the Middle Ages, and down to and through the period of 
renaissance, spices were used for the production of sauces to 
be eaten with meat. But cinnamon, the principal ingredient 
of these sauces, has for many generations been confined 
to the spicing of sweet dishes, and been almost entirely 
excluded from savoury compositions. The principal spices 
of the cameline sauce (probably a corruption from cannelline 
sauce), of which the corporation of the saucier s of Paris 
obtained a monopoly, about 1494, under Louis XII., were 
cinnamon, cloves, grains of Paradise, bread, and vinegar. 
Of the sauce called gence, ginger was the prevailing flavour, 
with almonds, verjuice, and wine.

SALINE CONDIMENTS 91 

Classification of Condiments. 
In the following pages we have attempted a classification 
of condiments for the pm^pose of obtaining some kind of 
order in which the materials may be grouped. We have 
included culinary colouring matters, although only one of 
them is actually an aromatic substance, because they are 
most frequently used in combination with condiments. 

First Group : Saline Condiments. 

Common Salt {CJiloride of Sodium). — Salt is not only a 
condiment, but also a mineral food, essential to the neutrali- 
zation in the human body of the effects of the large quan- 
tities of potassium salts introduced in vegetable food. It is 
for this reason that vegetable feeders, or so-called vege- 
tarians, require relatively more salt with their food, par- 
ticularly potatoes, than flesh-eaters. Similarly, herbivora 
seek salt, and like it, while carnivora never do. But when 
we observe how small are the quantities which herbivorous 
animals, e.g., horses or deer, obtain from day to day, or 
that many, e.g., cattle and deer in some parks, never obtain 
any, we cannot believe that it is essential to them as food, 
but is sought by them mainly as a spice, for the sake of its 
impression upon the sense of taste. A German professor of 
so-called physiological chemistry asserts that * we ' (meaning 
society at large) * are accustomed to take far too much salt 
with our viands.' This is, perhaps, only partly true for 
portions of the Continent, but is certainly not so for Eng- 
land, where dishes of all kinds are only slightly salted, and 
the final conditioning of each morsel is left to the individual 
consumer. We recommend cooks to adhere to this well- 
established practice, and rather to under than over salt 
their productions ; they should also take care to remove by 
judicious soaking in water all superfluous salt from salted 
provisions, which, like hams or salt fish, are preserved in an 
excess of the mineral condiment. 



92 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Saltpetre or Nitre {Nitrate of Po^as/^).— This salt is used 
in conjunction with common salt for preserving meat. Its 
particular function is to maintain and heighten the red 
colour of the flesh, or some colouring matter derived from 
it. That this is its only function seems supported by the 
fact that it is never used in the preservation of fish. 

Second Group : Peppery Substances — French Epices. 

Pepper consists of the corns or fruit of the pepper-tree, 
Piper nigrum. While fresh the corns are red, but become 
black on drying. When they are decorticated they are 
termed luliite pepper. This latter kind is preferable for use 
in cases in which the black particles of the peel would pro- 
duce an unpleasant impression upon the eye, e.g., in light- 
coloured or white dishes, on etiolised herbs, yellow salads, 
etc. The coarsely-pounded white pepper for use in salads, 
particularly white endive, is in the French kitchen termed 
concassd. Pepper yields a tincture, i.e., a solution in spirit 
of wine, which contains all its active ingredients. 

Cayenne pepper, the fruit capsules of Capsicum haccatum 
annuum, long or red pepper. The solanaceous plant was 
known to the Komans, and is grown all over the world. 
The powdered berry is a very powerful, fiery spice, and 
requires to be used with great discretion. But when so 
used it imparts to viands suitable for its application a flavour 
and warmth which is agreeable to the palate and beneficial 
to the digestive organs. Its tincture is particularly useful, 
as it distributes the taste and flavour equally throughout 
the substance of the viands, e.g., aspics. The essential parts 
are also soluble in vinegar ; but this is used much less than 
vinegar impregnated with the extract of chilis. 

Chili, or chilli, fruit - capsules of Capsicum haccatum 
frutescens, L., is grown in both Indies, and sold dried or 
preserved in vinegar. Placed in substance upon the tongue, 
it has an indescribably terrible effect, comparable to a mix- 



PEPPERY SUBSTANCES 93 

ture of the effects of fire or heat, pain, and undefinable dis- 
tress, which lasts for hours, and even days. Its active 
extract must, therefore, be always greatly diluted by cooks, 
for it is very bad form to cause surprises to guests by putting 
before them dishes containing excess of these spices. 

Allspice, Jamaica peioper, French Piment de la Jamaique, 
consists of the berries of Myrtus lyimenta, L. Its taste and 
smell is much like that of a mixture of nutmeg, cloves, 
cinnamon, and pepper, but less energetic. It might, 
perhaps, be placed in the following third group, to which it 
forms, at all events, a transition. It is little used in cookery 
in this country, but enters largely into the adulterated 
spice powders sold to the public. 

The French term all the capsicums as well as allspice 
piment, and distinguish them from each other by adjectives 
or places of origin ; thus, the small chili to them is piment 
enragS ; as thrushes, ruffs and reeves, and other birds can 
eat and digest this berry in quantities, it is also called jnmeiit 
des oiseaux. There is here an immunity resembling that of 
rabbits to the effect of foxglove or digitalis. The bush pro- 
ducing the Jamaica piment is by the French called bois 
d'Inde ; its ripe berries are violet, juicy, sweet, and highly 
perfumed, but very hot to the taste. They are eaten in 
great quantities by wood-pigeons, thrushes, and blackbirds, 
and other birds, which thereby acquire an exquisite flavour 
and become very fat. For the production of allspice the 
berries are collected in a somewhat under-ripe state, and 
dried in the sun. 

The foregoing are in daily use in cookery or at the table. 
The following kinds of peppery substances are either used 
only in certain localities, or only as medicine, or for particular 
objects and rarely, or are obsolete, and used for adulteration : 

Ava, or Cava, Piper methysticum, Forst., Tahiti; used as 
an intoxicant. 

U7ione Ethiopica, D.C., Ethiopian pepper, from Unona 
aromatica ; used as spice in Guyana. 



94 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Betel, leaf of Piper betel (Betle), L. ; chewed in Hindo- 
stan, while wrapped round powder of areca nut (areca 
catechu). 

Guhehs, from Piper cub eh a ; used as a medicine only, 
and therefore excluded from dietetic use. 

Paradise grains, from Amomum granum Paradisi, were 
formerly used as spice in France ; are now employed for 
flavouring beer. 

Nepal or Nepaul pepper, is frequently used in Hindo- 
stanee cookery, and often mentioned by * Wyvern ' as used 
by the English in India. 

Third Group : Aromatic Substances Proper — French 
Aromates. 

Cinnamon, bark, from Per sea or Laurus cinnamomum. 

Clove, flower of Caryophyllus aromaticus. 

Nutmeg, nut of Myristica aromatica. 

Mace, the seed-mantle of the nutmeg. 

Cardamoms, seeds of Elettaria cardamomiim, a near rela- 
tive of the Paradise grains mentioned above. 

Vanille, seed-pods of Vanilla aromatica. 

Quatre Epices, four -spices, is the French name of the fruit, 
termed in HmdiO^id^n Bavendsara, of a laurel, Agathophyllum 
aromaticum ; it is used in Madagascar like cloves, and 
occurs in older French recipes, not in new. The name is 
a mystic indication of strength, this plural of ' four ' being 
similarly applied by old French authors in a number of 
cases. Eavendsara is actually a single spice made from 
one kind of fruit only. 

Turmeric, root of Cuixuma zeodaria, Rose. ; in Hindo- 
stanee, Quoorm ; Germ. Zittiuer. 

Ginger, Fr. Gingembre ; Germ. Ingiver ; root of Zin- 
giber officinalis. (* Yellow ginger ' is a false name for 
turmeric, from Curcuma longa.) 



AROMATIC AND SHARP SUBSTANCES 95 

Saffron, pistils of Crocus sativus ; almost obsolete. An 
Arabic name for saffron is Caruma, said by Merat and 
Delens to hav-e been corrupted to Curcuma, but this is 
doubtful, as the Hindostanee name for Curcuma is Quoorm, 
the turmeric above quoted, and not saffron. 

Fourth Group : Parts of Cruciferous and Composite Plants 
with Sharp Oil. 

Mustard, seed of Sinaj^is nigra and alba, L. 

Tarragon, leaves of Artemisia dracunculus sativus ; Fr. 
Esdragon ; Germ. Tragantli. 

Anis, seed of Piminnella a7iisum, L. 

Caraway, or cummin-seed, from Carum Carui, L. ; Gr. 
Karon, Arab. Karawia. The form cummin occurs in Greek 
as Kyminon, Germ. Kilmmel. The Germans use this seed 
as a flavouring for brandy, cheese, bread, and cabbage. In 
England it is used as a flavouring for an excellent kind of 
cake, called seed-cake. 

Coriander, seeds of Coriandrum sativum, L., aroused — e.g., 
in curry (Kari), but must be grilled before use to expel a 
strong and disagreeable oil. The leaves of the plant are 
also used for marinades. 

Horseradish, root of Cocldearia Armoracea, Germ. Meer- 
rettig, is eaten raw in flakes obtained by scraping or grating, 
or grated and boiled in sauce ; contains a sulphuretted 
crystallizable oil. Its French names are Grand Baifort, 
Cran, Cran de Bretagne. 

From this fourth group we pass by galgant, imrsley, 
celery, etc., gradually into the domain of green condiments, 
such as onions, garlic, leek, etc., which also contain a 
stdjjhurous oil, like mustard and horseradish. But these 
will be treated of under the chapter relating to vegetables 
used for soups, sauces, and entremets, and are not included 
under the condiments described in the present chapter. 



96 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Fifth Group : Aromatic Herbs, falsely called Savoury 
Herbs. 

Bmj-leaf, leaf of Laurus nobilis, L. ; used in pickles, 
marinades, and curries. This leaf acts by an aromatic oil, 
and besides develops some prussic acid by a decomposition 
of one of its ingredients. 

Thy7ne, the whole plant of Thymus vulgaris ^ L., in 
blossom. The variety called lemon thyyne is preferred for 
force-meat. 

Marjoram, Origanum majorana, L. Of this herb three 
varieties are used, called summer, winter, and boiling 
marjoram ; some also distinguish a wild and a sweet modi- 
fication. 

Basil (siveet), Ocymum hasilicum, L. ; used for marinading 
fish and venison. 

Savory, Satureja hortensis. Of this herb, two varieties, 
summer and ivinter savory, are used. The name savory is 
a corruption of the Latin name satury, and is not derived 
from any savoury qualities, which, correctly speaking, it 
does not possess, for it is truly aromatic. The adjective 
savory has been extended to some similar herbs, which are 
now sold as a mixture, dried in bottles, broken up with 
stalks, wood, and all. Take care to use only leaves, finely 
powdered, and avoid, by picking out, wood and stalks. 
Savory is the best flavouring for green French beans, 
scarlet and white runners. Take care for this purpose to 
obtain the entire i^lant, and the particular species, and not 
a mixture with others, which would spoil the beans. 
Greengrocers are sometimes so ignorant as to believe, or, 
at all events, to assert, that one aromatic herb is as good 
as another for beans, ' because they are all savoury ' ; 
their ignorance confounds the adjective wrongly applied to 
aromatics with the corrupted name of the satury. 

Mint, Mentha sativa or viridis ; used raw as a flavouring 



AROMATIC AND SHARP SUBSTANCES 97 



for sweet-sour sauce made of vinegar and sugar, to be eaten 
with lamb, or boiled with green peas, etc, 

Bosemary, Bosmarinus officinalis, L. ; used for marinading 
fish and special kinds of meat. 

Sage, leaves of Salvia officinalis, L. ; used for marinading 
eels, and in combination with onions for stuffing roast ducks 
or roast veal. 

Tansy, Tanacctum vuJgare ; occurs in old recipes, now 
obsolete. 

Fennel, Fceniculum officinale; was used in pastry and 
other dishes, now almost obsolete. 

Dill, Anethum graveolens ; the herb and flower-tops are 
used as condiments with pickles. Its oclour is very fine, 
and imparts itself agreeably to gravy soup. 

Chervil, Anthriscus cerefolitmi, Hoffm. ; Germ. Korhel ; 
used on the Continent as an ingredient of soups. 

Angelica, Arcliangelica officinalis ; the stalks of this 
plant which grows well in Northern Europe, are candied, 
and used in puddings and pastry. They preserve a light- 
green colour, which they also impart, together with their 
fiavour, to spirits to be used as liqueurs. 

Asafoetida, the condensed juice or resin drawn by in- 
cision or abscission of the root of Ferula Asafcetida ; it was 
used as a flavouring agent of food by the ancients, and is 
even now used sometimes for imparting to certain dishes 
a kind of garlic flavour. 

To this group also apply the observations which we have 
appended above to the paragraph concerning the fourth 
group. The aromatic herbs, as we prefer to term them, are 
included by Dumas in the group of culinary herbs, second 
category, comprising herbs for flavouring, seasoning, or 
dressing {herhes d'assaisojinement) ; but chives and shallots 
are substituted for fennel and chervil on our list. The 
above order may be altered or arranged more stringently 
in accordance with botanical or chemical principles, but

meanwhile it will be useful as a review of spices and 
aromatics at the command of culinary art. 

Essences or Tinctures of Spices. 

The following spices may be extracted with spirit, and 
the tinctures be used to give aroma to finished dishes : 
Cinnamon, cloves, black and white pepper, cayenne pepper, 
vanilla, bay-leaves, nutmeg, mace, lemon-peel, saffron, 
caraway, ginger, thyme, basil, marjoram, and a few 
others. 

Most of these spices can be extracted with spirit of the 
strength called ijroof-spirit ; only three spices, ginger, cara- 
way, and white pepper, had better be extracted with spirit 
containing about 70 per cent, of absolute alcohol, rectified 
spirit. Be very careful in the selection of the spices, so 
that they be pure and unadulterated. Then pound them, 
and place each in a bottle, provided with a close-fitting 
stopper of cork or glass, and labelled. Now pour three 
times the weight of spirit over them, close the bottles, let 
them stand for a fortnight, frequently shaking them, and 
then separate the tinctures from the powder by filtration. 
Put each tincture back into its labelled bottle, which has 
been washed, and keep the produce for use. When the 
exhausted powder is placed on the filter, it may yet be 
washed with its own weight of spirit, so that the complete 
tincture amounts to four times the weight of the powder in 
each case. The exhausted powders should be burnt. A 
new filter is requisite for each spice. 

With these tinctures you can impart the special spicy 
taste of each to every chosen dish. Do not add the spices at 
the beginning of coction, but at the end, in all cases in which 
the object is to flavour a liquid ; when you wish the flavour 
to penetrate into a solid body, a roast or a head of game, 
then add some spice at the beginning. On using the 
tinctures, measure each in a minim glass, and note on the 



GREEN AND ACID CONDIMENTS 99 



label the number of minims to be used for frequently 
recurring preparations, e.g., soups. All preparations less 
frequently recurring you must spice empirically by pouring, 
say, 20 minims of tincture in a spoon, diluting it with broth 
or wine, and adding it gradually to the dish to be treated. 
According to the result of gustation, you will withhold the 
rest in the spoon or add more. You have thus the spicing 
of dishes absolutely in your power, which is not the case 
with the solid spices. Keep the labelled spice tinctures on 
a separate little shelf, freely accessible, and not liable to be 
upset. 

Ajypendix to the Fifth Group: List of Green Condiments 

so called. 

Onions, garlic, rocambole, leek, shallots, ciboules, and chives 
will be considered under the chapter relating to vegetables 
for soups, sauces, and entremets. 

Garden-cress, loater-crcss, radisJies, cruciferous culinarij 
plants, turnips, will be treated in the same chapter ; as also 
celery (leaves and "stalks) and celeriac (root), pastinak, parsley 
(leaves) and parsliac (roots). Pimpernel, borage (Borago 
officinalis) will illustrate the history of salads; there will 
also be discussed the use of truffles, mushrooms, and other 
fungi, under the chapter referring to ragoiUs. 

Bouquet Garni. 
A bouquet garni* consists of parsley, thyme, and bay- 
leaf. The relative quantities of these ingredients are the 
following : 

Parsley in leaves and branches - - 30 grammes. 

Thyme 2 „ 

Bay-leaves - - - - - 2 ,, 

Pack the thyme and bay-leaves in the middle of the 
parsley, and bend the top of the parsley back over the leaves, 

* Of. Gouffe, loc. cU., p. 36. 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



so as to wrap them up ; then tie all with string, and clip 
the leaves which project and might become detached during 
boiling. The length of such a bouquet should be about 
2 inches or 5 centimetres. 

Sixth Group : Acid Condiments. 

Vinegar of tuine, lohite and red. Vinegar of malt, amber- 
coloured. Vinegar made from pure acetic acid by dilution 
with water. Of sijecially flavoured vinegars, French cooks 
prefer and keep in stock : Vinegar flavoured with tarragon, 
and vinegar spiced with chili. Of the latter many in- 
habitants of Central America use small quantities at table. 

The following vegetable acids and salts are used for im- 
parting an acid or acidulous taste to certain preparations of 
food, or confections, or beverages : 

Verjuice, the expressed juice of unripe grapes or cur- 
rants, etc. 

Citric or tartaric acid, used, e.g., in the confection of 
Turkish delight, Bahat Lakoum. 

Bitartrate of ijotash, used for acidulating compound 
beverages, such as ginger-beer. 

Seventh Group : Odoriferous Parts of Plants (not being 
Aromatic), and Scents extracted therefrom. 

Bose {floioer) leaves and rose-ivater, used for flavouring 
confections in the Orient, such as Bahat Lakoum, cocoanut- 
cakes. 

Orange (flower) leaves and orange-floiver loater. The 
leaves are used dried, candied, and grilled (praline)) the 
water is used in several confections also. 

Eighth Group : Culinary Colouring Matters. 
Saffron, which yields the historical yelloiv used in cookery, 
may be mentioned here again, although already registered 
as a spice. 



VARIETIES OF SUGAR 



Violet-blue, derived from the juice of violet-flower petals. 

Kermes-red is extracted from the juice of the kermes 
insect, Coccus ilicis* ; kept as a syrup or conserve ; Arab. 
alkermes. 

Bose-red, prepared from the petals of the Bosa gaJlica as 
a syrup. t 

Spinage-green, freshly expressed juice or precipitate by 
boiling of such. 

Cochineal, the carmine -red from the cochineal insect, 
Coccus cacti ; prepared as a cake or a solution.

Clarification of Sugar by Sohction and Beconcentration by 
Boiling ; Stages or Degrees of Sugar -boiling. 

For purposes of confectionery, sugar is clarified by being 
dissolved in a little water, heated and skimmed ; it is then 
gradually boiled down, and the different degrees of concen- 
tration through which the syrup gradually passes have 
received the following technical names : 

First degree : Fr. Sucre a la nappe ; Germ. Breitlauf.

Sixth degree: Fr. Sucre au casse ; Germ. Der Bruch. 

Seventh degree: Fr. Caramel; Germ. Gebrannter zucker, 
caramel. 



SUGAR G LACES 103 



Glaizes or Glaces of Sugar ; Sugar Glaces. 

The glaces are produced by the application to the outside of 
confectionery of some of the sugars described in the previous 
Hues. They should not be confounded with meat-glaizcs, 
being savoury sauces or extract of meat made gelatinous 
with more or less gelatine. 

1. Cold sugar glaces consist of white sugar powder stirred 
with ivhite of egg. They may be coloured by any of the 
colouring matters above enumerated, and be perfumed by 
any of the agents described. 

2. Cold sugar glaces for conserving are made with cold 
syrup and sugar-powder. They may be made plain, or 
flavoured with essences or liqueurs, or be made with odorant 
sugar. 

3. Hot Glaces for Conserving.— Glsices of orange, straw- 
berries, raspberries, pineapple -juice, and others are em- 
ployed. A glace of chocolate is now frequently used. 

Spiced Pepper and Spiced Salt as Conventional Compounds. 

For all stuflB.ngs and force-meats, whether required for 
roast, boiled, or braised poultry, for the dainty galantine 
or the savoury pie, there are few things more useful to have 
at hand than spiced pepper."^ It saves great trouble, and is 
valuable for many dishes. The following mixture can be 
kept in bottle and used ad libitum : 

^ oz. of dried thyme-leaves; ^ oz. of dried marjoram; 
\ oz. of dried savory ; h oz. of nutmeg ; J oz. of cloves; 
\ oz. of ichole black pepper ; \ oz. of Nepaul pepper. Pound 
all these spices, and when ground to a powder pass this 
through a sieve, bottle it, and keep the bottle securely 
corked. This mixture imparts a nice sausage flavour to 
savoury pies, rolled beef, brawn, savoury pctiis, and all 
force-meat. 

" On 'spiced pepper,' cf. 'Wyvern,' loc. cif., p. Ill, 



I04 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Spiced Salt. 
Spiced salt* is made by mixing 1 oz. of sjnced pepper 
with 4 oz. of salt. Before pepper was confined to special 
boxes or caraffines of the cruet-stand, it was generally 
served in this form, and stood on the table in a salt-cellar, 
as does now our pure salt. 



CHAPTER VI. 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH; ITS DEVELOPMENT 
AND ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF COOKERY. 

Historical Introduction. 

' The sapid principle of meat may be described without exaggeration 
as the quintessence of the art of cookery.' — Louis Proust. 

' French cookery owes its superiority over that of other nations only to 
(the excellence of French) bouillon.' — Alexandre Dumas. 

Whatever influence the Italians of the Renaissance may 
have exercised upon French cookery, to the French must 
be allowed the merit of having made bouillon, or broth, the 
foundation of the taste of all moist savoury preparations, 
and of having thereby made a great number of dishes more 
wholesome as well as more tasty than they were before 
this development. Amongst the ancient as well as the later 
Italians, the broth of meat remained almost unused, for 
even * the capon-broth with flour-paste ' (macaroni) men- 
tioned by early Italian novelists was used only on a very 
limited area, and had certainly no general application.! 
Greeks and Romans possessed large quantities of more or 
less fine olive-oil, and used this generally for penetrating 

* ' Spiced salt,' mentioned by Gouffe, and after him Wyvern. 
f Cf, Rumohr, loc. ciL, p. 10. 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 105 

moist dishes with its flavour and richness ; but this induced 
an excessive use of hot spices to counteract the sometimes 
sickening, or at all events unsympathetic, effect of a greasy 
diet, a result to which already Pliny "^ objected, and which 
may nevertheless be observed to be a matter of daily occur- 
rence in many parts of Europe. 

Where this oil was unavailing to impart taste and appe- 
tising qualities, certain extracts, we might term them 
sauces (liqua7nina) were used. Certain absurd reports, such 
as that these were made with the aid of salted pears, we 
may set aside, just as we set aside the fable of our days, 
that soy contained as a material ingredient extract from 
blackbeetles, while accepting the report of the preparation 
of some liquamina from valuable fish. Here, then, we have 
an approach to stock and glace ; the preparation of garwn, 
when its history is properly interpreted, tended in the same 
direction. 

But the jitra and juscula, as described sufficiently in the 
work bearing the name of Apicius, were by no means con- 
stituted of strong meat-broth, but were mixtures of oil, 
acids, spices, and vegetable juices, the effect of which was 
calculated merely with reference to immediate desire for 
stimulation of the tongue and palate. 

While the Mediterranean countries used oil, the North of 
Europe consumed butter, clarified butter, lard, and other 
animal fats. The inhabitants of Central France suffered 
from an insufficient supply of both classes of fats, and thus 
had a particular inducement for that precious application of 
meat-broth which marks an epoch in the development of 
culture. And at the present time the majority of Europeans 
are so accustomed to this use of meat-essence that even the 
refined part of the cookery of the ancients, and much of the 
cookery of the Spaniards, Italians and Greeks of our time, 
appears to us inattractive. 

* Voce 'Greasy Diet'; cf. Pliny, 'Nat, Hist.,' lib. xii,, cap. vii. 



io6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Eumohr was in possession of accounts of the housekeeping 
of Louis XV. of France for the year 1756 ; these documents 
proved that at the table of the Eoyal Family only eight or 
nine dishes were served, while sixty appeared daily on the 
table of Louis XVIII. But two-thirds of the meat which 
was used in the kitchen were employed in the production of 
bouillon intended for incorporation with the rest. This is a 
very clear manifestation of the tendency of the art of cookery 
since the Eenaissance. In culinary publications of the same 
period, e.g., * Dons de Comus,' a book which passed through 
many editions, the genuine French mode of preparing dishes 
with broth is given, but at the same time, and very properly, 
many of the over-mixed and over-cooked little dishes of 
Italian art are described. Thus, in the chapter on ' Divers 
Entremets ' we find, under the title of roties, those little 
pieces of fried bread, crustini, covered with some forcemeat, 
which to this day form so prominent a part of the garnish 
of Italian dishes."* 

The French Eevolution improved the condition of the 
lower classes, and with this revived the use of the old 
French domestic meat-soup, the j^ot-au-feii.f This had the 
effect of making the taste of the nation averse to the strong 
spices, and inclined to a blander, simpler, finer diet. The 
whole canon of French cooking was spread through Europe, 
and even to East India, by the soldiers as well as the fugi- 
tives from France. And the latter learned in England and 
transferred to France those splendid modes of roasting meat 
for which the English kitchen is celebrated, and which the 
French kitchen, though largely profiting, has not even at 
present completely acquired. Eepublic and First Empire 
maintained the best traditions, as is shown by menus from 
the time of Barere to the end of that of Napoleon. But the 
Eestoration, under the corrupting example of Louis XVIII., 

* ' Tant en gras qu'en maigre,' torn, iii., chap, vi., p. 137.

BOUILLON, OR ME AT- BROTH \q>-i 

led again to absurdly complicated extravagance, which out- 
shone the efforts at reasonable moderation as expressed in 
the popular work ' Cuisiniere Bourgeoise.' The result was 
affected over-complication, which was at first fostered by 
the * x\lmanach des Gourmands,' a publication of which we 
have spoken under the chapter on literature, and the affected 
over-refinement reached an almost grotesque climax in the 
' Physiologie du Gout,' the author of which in reality stood 
in the same relation to good cooking as the promoter of the 
' Almanach ' to polite manners. 

It was about the year 1820 that the scientific consideration 
of the principles of cookery was for the first time attempted. 
For the first time broth was spoken of as extract or essence 
of meat, the strength and value of which stood in direct 
proportion to the weights of the essential ingredients used 
in its preparation, A standard was established by means 
of which all cooks could compare facts, processes, and pro- 
ducts, and work within reasonable outlines drawn by 
economy as well as hygienic, and even elegant nutrition. 
Before considering more closely the details of this discovery, 
we must notice the scientific and practical forerunners of 
this movement. 

Claude Joseph Geoffroy, the younger brother of Etienne 
Francois (a Parisian chemist, 1G86 to 1752), made some 
researches* in 1730 to 1732, the object of which was to 
ascertain the amount and nature of the matters which 
boiling water extracted from meat ordinarily consumed ; he 
endeavoured to weigh the proportion of extract soluble in 
water in the dry state, and compare it to the quantity of 
insoluble residue also reduced to and weighed in the dry state. 
The residues of both processes were afterwards subjected to 

* ' Examen chimique des viandes, qu'on emploie ordinairement dans les 
bouillons, par lequel ou peut reconnaitre la quantite d'extrait qu'elles four- 
nissent et determiner ce que chaque bouillon doit contenir de sue nouris- 
sant.' Mem. de I'Acad. d. Sc, 1732. [Lavoisier published 'Note sur le 
bouillon,' in ' Mem. de la Soc. Roy. de Med.' vii.] 



io8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

dry distillation, a process in which all further scientific 
inquiry, which had begun so promisingly, perished. The 
watery distillate of the extract of beef had the flavour of 
bouillon of beef. 

Ten years after Geoffroy's ' Memoir ' was published the 
following recipe for ' Extract of Meat in Dry Tablets, which 
can b3 easily transported and preserved during a year and 
longer.'* These tablets dissolved in water form grand 
houillon, and are made as follows : Take a quarter of an ox, 
an entire calf, or part of one if it be large, two sheep, and 
two dozen of old hens or cocks ; prepare all in the usual 
manner ; parboil and clean the feet of the calf and sheep, 
remove all visible fat, and put the whole in a large copper ; 
add the decoction already prepared of from 12 lb. to 15 lb. of 
hartshorn shavings ; cover the meat, etc., with spring water, 
and cover the boiler, weighting the lid with 60 lb. Let 
the meat boil over a gentle fire quietly, without skimming, 
during six hours or more, until all meat is thoroughly done 
and all soft parts are easily detached from the bones. 
Eemove the large bones, leaving all the rest on the fire ; 
take out all the meat, mince it, and put it into a great press 
with (hotted) iron plates, to extract all juice. Eeturn the 
pressed-out liquid to the bouillon in the caldron, pass all 
thro.ugh a horsehair tamis; let cool, and remove the fat. 
You can now salt and spice the bouillon ; continue to boil 
while constantly stirring it, until a portion placed on a cold 
plate sets to a jelly, and the extract becomes thick like 
honey and brown in colour. Take it off the fire, let it cool 
somewhat, and put it into glazed earthenware vessels of a 
long and flat shape (pans) not exceeding three inches in 
depth. 

When the extract has become cold, set it to dry in a 
closet or a baker's oven after the bread has been removed, 
taking care not to let it get either roasted or burned, but 

* La Chapelle, 'Le Cuisinier Moderne,' vol. i., p. 84, 1742. 



BOUILLON, OR ME AT- BROTH 109 

only hard like dry glue, so that it can be easily broken. 
Preserve this in well-closed vessels. These tablets, dis- 
solved in v^ater, are of excellent taste, and serve to make all 
kinds of bouillons and simmered soups. 

The quantity to be used is from 1 oz. to IJ oz. to a pint 
{choj)ine) of water ; even 2 oz. may be used, according to 
the strength desired. 

This is excellent broth, even though half its solid matter 
be gelatine. To the bouillon any flavour may be imparted 
by carrots, turnips, onions, chervil, celery, leeks, or any 
mixture of them. La Chapelle also gives the proportion 
for small quantities. He finds the tablets of great use during 
travelling. 

At the head of his soups La Chapelle describes what we 
call ^toch in this country, houillon, que Von ai^pelle Mitonnacjc 
(sbmnerincjs). It is produced by boiling an edible piece 
{morccau de tranche) and a portion of leg {trumeau, gravy- 
beef) ; boil and skim, then salt and add vegetables and 
spices ; then the other fancy additions are given : a hen, 
a knuckle of veal, celery, chicory, leeks, lettuces, onions 
stuck with cloves, roots, etc. With this bouillon all other 
soups can be produced; but soups of cabbage or turnips 
must not be mixed with it, as they have a separate strong 
flavour. 

In vol. v., p. 10, La Chapelle repeats the recipe for the 
portable houillon in the shape of tablets. He adds all the 
vegetables and spices for general stock ; the meat, beef, 
veal, old hens, or cocks, even a turkey, and partridges are 
amongst the facultative ingredients, and are all cut into 
small pieces. The boiling is continued during ten hours, 
the boiler being heated from the side to boil gently ; the 
broth is filtered through hair sieve and napkin, and allowed 
to cool ; the green stuff is removed, and the clear liquid is 
boiled down to the consistence of extract, being skimmed 
as often as need may be. The thick glace is put in earthen

shallow pans, and dried in hot closet or oven as above 
described, to the condition of solid glue. 

La Chapelle says (p. 12) that some made great mystery 
of these tablets, but his under-cooks knew all about them, 
and left their production to the plain helps. Perhaps this 
information may assist in explaining how it was that they 
became discredited. 

A recipe printed in Johann Christoph Wiegleb's"^ edition 
of the * Natural Magic ' of Martins, seems to be a copy, 
with slight variations, of that of La Chapelle ; the two 
sheep are omitted, but the single turkey is multiplied 
by twelve. The recipe and the tablets seem to have 
been gradually forgotten, and found little or no practical 
application. Towards the end of the last and in the 
beginning of the present century, however, there were pre- 
pared at Buenos Ayres, by a privileged company, and in 
England and some of her colonies, tablets which were sold 
in trade for the rapid and cheap production of bouillon. 
On analysis, one hundred parts of these yielded to alcohol 
only five parts (instead of fifty, as true meat-extract would 
have yielded) ; allowing five further parts as matter in- 
soluble in alcohol belonging to true meat-extract, the tablets 
contained ninety parts in one hundred of mere gelatine. 
The part soluble in alcohol had only an undecided and 
feeble taste of meat. On inquiry this was fully explained 
by the manner in which the tablets were made, for they 
were produced from offal, feet, cartilages, bone-ivory and 
(stag) horn shavings. Thus the savory principle was 
replaced by glue ; the tablets, even with the addition of 
vegetable-extract, salt and spice, would never yield a tasty 

* Wiegleb was born at Langansalza in 1732, and was therefore ten years 
of age when La Chapelle wrote ; he died in 1800. Martius's ' Instruction

soup, and became discredited. ' Glue does not make 
bouillon.' These tablets were counterfeits of the true 
tablets of portable bouillon, and were instrumental in de- 
stroying their reputation. To restore their reputation and 
establish a manufacture of a saleable standard article, a 
company was founded by two Dutch merchants of the 
name of Bouwens and Van Copenael, both domiciled at 
Paris. Their product was sold and known as Bouillon cle la 
Compagnie Hollandaise, and seems to have been a fair 
article of trade, containing certainly much extract of meat ; 
for the French chemist Chevreul, who examined this 
product as member of a commission appointed by the 
Academy of Sciences in 1831, discovered in it the crys- 
tallized substance creatine in 1835, a discovery which 
marks the beginning of the chemical knowledge of flesh 
and its preparation. 

Proust examined the relative cost of his absolutely pure 
extract and of the extracts containing gelatine ; he dis- 
covered a further source of difficulty in the appreciation 
of some varieties of bouillon tablets in this, that they con- 
tained salt — i.e., sodium chloride — caramel or burnt sugar, 
and extracts of parts of vegetables ; these additions made 
the tablets not only still less valuable by dilution, but 
rendered them deliquescent. The tablets were, in fact, an 
imitation, and a bad one too, of an old-established pre- 
paration current in all higher-class kitchens, namely, glace 
(or glaze, or glaize), the evaporated extract of the stock-pot, 
in fact a weak, and in its weakness varying, extract of meat 
mixed with as much gelatine as could practically be added 
to it. The Germans called this product pochet-bouiUon, 
the French bouillon sec. Both stock-pot and glace will be 
considered lower down; here we continue the historical 
account of the subject, by premising that neither Proust 
nor Chevreul, and a fortiori none of the members of the 
commission of the Academy, seems to have been acquainted

with the true mode of producing portable dry bouillon as 
taught in the recipe recorded by La Chapelle. 

Discovery of the Extract of Meat by Louis Proust. 

The researches of Proust* pubHshed in 18211 on the 
sapid or savoury principles of meat were made in the course 
of an investigation into the nutritive value of certain tablets 
for the production of bouillon which had been imported 
from South America. Thouvenel had made known as the 
result of his meditation and experiment that meat-broth 
owes its quality to a peculiar principle to be found in meat 
only. Of all the tissues of the animal body, flesh alone 
gives this principle as a tasty broth, which excites the 
appetite ; the other tissues (the brain alone excepted) give 
only insipid extracts and solutions of glue or gelatine. No 
plants, and no parts of plants, some fungi excepted, possess 
the savour of animal broth. The sa'pid ])rinci])le of meat 
viay he described loithout' exaggeration as the quintessence 
of the art of cookenj. 

Ten pounds of beef without bones fully extracted with 
boiling water gave a tasty broth which, after it had been 
evaporated and dried as far as could be, left ten half-ounces 
of sohd extract of meat. This Proust terms the model of 
all that could be prepared in the line of materials for 
making bouillon, and argues further that, as 10 lb. of beef 
did not give less than 10 lb. of tasty and rich broth, we 
might by adding to -|- oz. of the sohd meat-extract 1 lb. of 
water and the usual salt and spices, produce a bouillon as 
good as it can be made by any other method. 

On the other hand, Proust extracted 20 lb, of fat beef 
containing 5 lb. of bones, and obtained by evaporation of

and the beginning of the present century. During the Terror period of the 
French Revolution he left Paris, and lived at Madrid until the Restoration.

BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 113 

the resulting broth 1 lb. of dry extract. But according to 
the first experiment he should have obtained only fifteen 
half ounces, or ^ oz. of extract from every pound of flesh. He 
had, therefore, to account for the origin of the excess 
of 8|^ oz. of extract, and did so as follows : The bones had 
not changed in v^eight during boiling, which caused the 
investigator to exclaim, * YoiVa comme les os font clu bouillon,^ 
in allusion to the fallacy current in many kitchens, that 
broth could be extracted by boiling from mere bones ; the 
excess of weight in the extract had been obtained by the 
formation of gelatine from soft parts — that is to say, gristle, 
tendons, ligaments, and membranes. 

Proust described the pure extract as a dry, flexible, 
elastic, brownish paste, which imparted to the mouth so 
intense a taste of meat that at first it was disagreeable. 
He found that alcohol separated from it half its weight in 
the shape of savoury principle, and that the part insoluble 
in alcohol was tasteless like gelatine. When fresh meat was 
treated with alcohol, the savoury matter was also extracted, 
and it was thus proved that the savoury principle is pre- 
sent in the meat before cooking, and is not produced by 
the process of cooking. The gravy of roast meat which 
flows during roasting pre-exists in the meat, just as the 
flavour of rum exists in the watery extract of the sugar- 
cane, but it becomes altered and improved by the influence 
of heat. 

The meat fibre deprived of its juice is still nourishing, 

but completely tasteless. Geoffroy pressed it to remove 

■the last traces of broth, and found that men would not 

eat it, and dogs devoured it only under the compulsion of 

hunger. 

Proust surmised that the most active principle in the pro- 
duction of the sapid meat-extract was an acid,* and promised 
to prove this in a subsequent article ; he unfortunately left 

* Probably the acid termed subsequently inosinlc acid by Liebig.

114 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

his promise unfulfilled. He correctly appreciated meat- 
extract as a flavouring, taste-giving and stimulating prin- 
ciple, and thus distinguished it from materials for sub- 
stantial nutrition. For according to him there is no 
material amongst the resources of the kitchen equal to it 
in power to flavour certain dishes. This meat-extract and 
ilie savoury i)rincii)les of cheese''' have of all food-stuffs the 
highest sajndity. 

It is thus proved that the discovery and appreciation of 
extract of meat belongs to Proust, that he excluded decoc- 
tions of bones and all gelatine from any share in the value of 
meat-extract, and applied his standard to the valuation of 
articles of trade, such as bouillon tablets or glace. 

Common Stock, or Grand (General or Store) Stock. 

Some modern books on cookery begin with a description 
of common stock, without attempting to define a standard of 
strength or quality. This want of a reliable measure, which 
can be made up for only partially by the aid of the taste, 
leads to a multiplicity of operations and makeshifts, and to 
a great loss of material and time. The noted cooks have 
only one stock-broth, others have two or three qualities, 
the third being the weakest. For all purposes of cookery 
but one stock-pot is required, and that holding standard 
broth of beef or iimtton, each innt of lohich contains the 
soluble {in boiling loater) j^art of one po2md of fresh meat. If 
this be too rich for any purpose, as for several it undoubtedly 
is, it may be diluted with hot water, but it need never be 
concentrated. The weak broths, on the contrary, which are 
prescribed for so many operations in ordinary cookery-books, 
all require hours of boiling before they assume a sufficiently 
concentrated state, and do not impart any noteworthy 

* Proust's ' Disquisition on Cheese,' in the course of which he discovered 
the remarkable principle 'oxyde of cheese,' later, and at present, termed 
leucine, was published in Ann. Ghim. Phys., vol. x., p. 29. 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 115 

quality to the materials which are boiled in them ; on the 
contrary, they frequently extract materials which ought to 
be retained in the vegetable or animal substances and tissues 
undergoing coction, and by the prolonged boiling which 
they require for concentration dissipate the flavours dis- 
solved in them. 

New Principles for the Preparation and Use of Standard 

Broth. 

We produce our standard bouillon or broth by dissolving 
an ounce of Proust's extract of beef, or extract of mutton, 
in a quart of hot water. With this we operate in such a 
manner that we know the bouillon strength of each dish, as 
expressed in soluble extract from given weights of beef or 
mutton. The advantage of such a solution over the best 
beef-tea made in the exact proportion of 2 lb. of minced 
beef free from bone, fat and tendon, to just so much water 
as is necessary for it to yield a quart of boiling product, is 
evident from the following considerations : Firstly, to produce 
this best beef-tea, we should have to get and pay for 2 lb. of 
gravy-beef, free from bone and fat. Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. ; we 
should then have to mince it very fine, which requires a 
rotatory mincing-machine, a mincing-board, and a special 
mincing - knife ; we should then have to mix the mince 
with a quart of cold water and gradually heat it to boiling ; 
after ten minutes' boiling we should have to strain the broth 
through a cloth or tammy, and either to press or to edul- 
corate the residue with pure hot water to exhaust it. The 
broth thus obtained would certainly be good as regards 
strength, but it would be turbid from fat, glycogen, and 
suspended albuminous particles, and would be the more 
decidedly greasy the fatter had been the beef or mutton 
from which it had been prepared. We should therefore 
be obliged to perform upon it two operations before we could 
use it for high-class cooking. We should have to let it get 



ii6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

cold, and remove the fat from the top, or the bouillon 
from underneath the fat (the latter would be the quicker 
process if proper apparatus were employed). Secondly, we 
would have to clarify the broth by means of dissolving and 
causing to curdle in it, by heat, a certain quantity of white 
of egg. This would involve the purchase of the eggs, the 
beating of the white of the eggs, mixing it with the broth, 
adding lemon-juice, heating the mixture first to coagulation, 
next to boiling, and then allowing it to simmer until the 
separation of albumin and broth be complete. We should 
then have to filter the broth through a fine napkin. And 
then, with all this labour and expense, we should be just at 
the same point as that which we attain immediately by dis- 
solving an ounce of Proust's extract in a quart of hot water. 
A quarter of a pound of the best manufacture of Proust's 
extract of meat, or beef, costs 2s., therefore 1 oz. costs 
6d. ; this gives a quart of broth certainly equal in value of 
every description, if not superior, to the quart of broth for 
which the meat alone costs from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d., and upon 
which we should have to spend all the trouble, time, and 
expense (coals, eggs, lemon) described in the foregoing. 
Our standard broth therefore costs, as regards first outlay, 
only one-third of its equivalent of gravy-beef ; but when we 
consider the work and expense of producing first-class broth 
from beef or mutton directly, we are constrained to say that 
such broth as elaborated from gravy-beef is at least six times 
as dear as broth from beef-extract of equal culinary value. 
In this argument it is assumed that the time of the cook, 
wear of apparatus, firing, albumin, lemon, and washing of 
two napkins, may be estimated at Is. 6d. 

Preparation of Stock as commonly understood. 

Now let us compare with these processes for the prepara- 
tion of pure genuine bouillon, or meat-extract, the prepara- 
tion of stock as commonly understood and practised in even 



BOCILLOX, OR MEAT-BROTH 117 

the highest-class kitchens. The materials are gravy-beef, 
leg of beef, shoulder of beef, or gravy-piece, leg of (white) 
veal, and knuckle of veal. The proportions of beef to veal 
are given by Francatelli as two parts leg of veal to two 
parts gravy-beef, to one part leg of beef and one part knuckle 
of veal. Of the leg of veal, all that part is removed which 
is called the nut {noLr) or fricandeau pieces, and serves for 
removes or entrees. All the rest of the meat is cut off the 
bones, the beef is kept separate from the veal; but the 
bones, both of beef and veal, are thrown into the stock-pot 
together with the beef, covered with three times their volume 
of cold water (a quantity which could only be guessed at), 
and boiled for seven hours. We pass over the skimming 
(removal of scum) and the garnishings, which latter, though 
added later, must become greatly deteriorated in effect by 
such long boiling. The knuckle of veal and a portion of 
the residual veal from the leg are to be boiled by themselves 
for veal-broth ; most of the veal not used for the entrees is 
to be used for frying in the preparation of the sauces ; it 
therefore serves the purposes of broth or gravy, but is never 
brought into the actual shape or condition of it. 

Boiling Bones and Production of Gelatine. 

Now, whether the parts above taken as units for com- 
parison be practically pounds, stones, or half - hundred- 
weights, in any case at least one quarter of the weight of 
the joints w^ould be bone ; much would be ligaments and 
tendons, much fat, a little more than half w^ould remain as 
actual meat, mostly beef ; or the bones would weigh nearly 
as much as half the meat. And these bones, broken in 
pieces, are to be boiled for seven hours. We know exactly 
the result of boiling bones under such circumstances ; they 
lose nothing in weight, yield nothing to water, the result is 
nil; all the trouble, time, space, lire, etc., are absolutely 
wasted. So far, therefore, as the bare bones are concerned, 



ii8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

their presence does not affect the decoction advantageously, 
but may easily deteriorate it. But, then, what is boiled are 
not bare bones, but bones with connectiag joints, cartilages, 
ligaments, tendons, and some gristle. Now, all these parts 
just enumerated consist of collagenous or glue-forming tissue 
(the cartilages are peculiar, and yield but little soluble matter 
in culinary operations except after long boiling). And, 
indeed, all they yield to the decoction is gelatine or glue. 
This, being perfectly tasteless, contributes nothing of a flavour 
even ; its nutritive value, owing to its limited amount, is very 
small, and does not nearly equal the cost of the coal spent 
in its solution. Supposing the stock ultimately obtained 
were to set, i.e., to gelatinize well on cooling, the quantity of 
gelatine dissolved might be estimated to amount to an ounce 
(in the dry state) per quart, rather less than more. A 
portion of this gelatine would be obtained from the con- 
nective-tissue of the meat, beef as well as veal, but the 
latter would yield it easier, quicker, and in a greater relative 
quantity. The entire result of this seven hours' boiling, so 
far as the gelatine is concerned, could be obtained in a few 
minutes by the solution in the intended stock of a pro- 
portionate quantity of prepared gelatine. But for us to 
adopt such a proceeding in actual practice would require 
some proof that the presence of gelatine in stock or broth 
was advantageous to it in some manner or other. Anyhow, 
the presence of gelatine in broth is not by any means 
essential to the latter attaining very high perfection as well 
by itself as in most of its preparations. On the contrary, 
gelatine in broth or gravy may become indirectly the passive 
means of deterioration of the broth, for while pure extract 
of meat admits of being browned by heat without acquiring 
any disagreeable flavour, but, on the contrary, rather gain- 
ing in sapidity thereby, gelatine on being browned acquires 
a disagreeable flavour sui generis."*" When present in meat- 

* The belief or opinion of Gouffe, that the colour and flavour of gravy 
were due to broivned yelatine, is completely erroneous. 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 119 

extract in any notable quantity, it depresses its value inde- 
finitely by two adverse effects : firstly, it acts as a depressing 
factor upon the money value of the meat-extract, its value 
weight for weight being much smaller than that of extract ; 
and further, its presence disposes the moist extract, whether 
in solution or concentrated, to be decomposed much quicker 
than it would be in its absence. Pure extract of meat as 
made by Proust's process, and now sold in trade, will 
remain good in the kitchen, larder, and pantry, even when 
broken into and frequently disturbed by the abstraction of 
small portions, for any practical length of time. We have 
never seen it mouldy ; but extract containing gelatine, which 
is not absolutely dry and solid, is very liable to become 
mouldy, and, in fact, mould on moist extract indicates the 
presence of gelatine, and is a criterion for its rejection. 

The quality of the stock to be obtained by the culinary 
process followed in ordinary establishments is, therefore, 
entirely dependent upon the beef and veal as far as it is 
constituted by muscular tissue. It is the flesh that yields 
the broth, and neither bone nor gristle nor fat imparts any 
taste or quality. Should we, then, in the preparation of 
stock exclude all bones systematically? To this we answer 
that if the bones be fresh, and easily cut out, they should 
certainly be removed and never enter the stock-pot. They 
are absolutely valueless. But bones from roast meat, on 
w^hich gravy has been evaporated and dried during the 
roasting, may be sufficiently impregnated with extract to 
make it worthwhile to subject them to a process of ablution 
with hot water. Such a solution w^ould have a little colour, 
and maybe some taste, but even the entire bones of a whole 
sirloin would not yield a breakfastcupful of drinkable 
broth, and in most cases the intended economy would not 
be rewarded by an adequate result. Carcases of game, on 
the other hand, i.e., the residues after the fillets only have 
been removed, may be very useful to the stock-pot, because 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



the flesh of the legs, being mostly uneatable, yields extract, 
and the internal organs, together with any dried gravy on 
the outside, yield a fine gravy flavour, a so-called fumet. 

Definition and Production of Glace. 

Before the discovery of meat-extract by Proust, practical 
cooks were by no means aware that savour resided in meat 
only, but shared the common error that gelatine in broth 
was a valuable ingredient, and that the setting of the broth 
into jelly on cooling indicated great strength. They there- 
fore so managed their sfcock-pot as to obtain a highly gela- 
tinized stock ; the pot became a museum of bones and 
vegetable residues, and when its contents were not worked 
up in actual cookery, they were evaporated down to a 
mostly dark-coloured extract called glace. This set, on 
cooling, into a solid mass, nearly as hard as cold meat, and 
was, and is in our days, kept ready, in various qualicies, for 
the improvement, characterization, or specialization of soups, 
sauces, entrees, etc. Our most celebrated cooks have seen 
a change in the taste of their masters, and effected a 
parallel one in their practice. In the first half of the 
century the soups called * clear ' were required to be of a 
glutinous, substantial character, or, in other words, they had 
to contain much gelatine duly flavoured by herbs ; this 
result the cooks managed to obtain by the addition of glace. 
But now the clear soups must be liquid, pronounced but 
not too concentrated as regards broth and flavour; the 
glutinous consistency is no longer preferred, but is relegated 
to the thick soups. We have even heard it asserted by one 
of our greatest chefs that this excessive consumption of glace 
in soups and entrees was discountenanced because it had 
a perceptibly injurious influence upon gouty persons, and 
seemed to produce the arthritic diathesis in others. 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 



Difference betwean Broth and Gravy. 

The flavour of broth, as perceived by tlie nose, is very 
sHght and delicate ; the gustatory impression is stronger. 
To become fully developed, gravy requires the effect of heat, 
when it is in the form of concentrated extract, so that it 
becomes slightly browned. Even highly-concentrated broth 
has never the stirring effect of light-brown gravy. Brotli, 
on the other hand, requires the addition of flavouring 
vegetables and spices. For soui:)s only the pale broth is 
requisite, but brown gravy imparts vivacity to the taste. 
For savoury sauces both the pale and the brown gravy are 
necessary. The hroion gravy is prepared by frying veal, 
ham, beef, fowl, game, etc., in butter until brown, and sim- 
mering the fry with stock ; ragouts are founded in a similar 
manner. 

The changes which the extractive matters of meat undergo 
when they turn from the bland and colourless form to that 
of reddish-brown gravy are very interesting subjects of 
study, particularly as gravy such as flows from roast beef 
cannot yet be produced at will from pale broth. The 
alkaloids and peptonoids of broth no doubt suffer a chauge 
similar to that which starch and sugar undergo when they 
are heated to high degrees of temperature ; they lose water, 
become more complicated, doubled and trebled in chemical 
structure, and assume different, new properties, amongst 
them a brown colour ; the new products, when resulting 
from carbo-hydrates, are termed caramels. To the brown 
products of the broth peptonoids the term ' caramel ' was 
actually applied by ancient great cooks, e.g., La Chapelle ; 
in our time the term osmazome, which was formerly applied 
to the whole aggregate of meat-extract, might be reappro- 
priated. The correct appreciation of the true source of 
savour has contributed greatly to establish sound prin- 
ciples of tasty and wholesome cookery ; to recall men from 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



overloaded, over-spiced, over-onioned, and over-complicated 
dishes to simpler compositions, and to cause them to look 
to the selection of the material and the preservation of its 
individuality as the first condition of sesthetical food-pre- 
paration. Simplification is still required even in establish- 
ments managed on highly cultivated principles ; for, as an 
example, to carefully take all grease out of a consomme by 
clarification, and then to pour back into it both grease and 
turbidity in the shape of cream, just before sending it to 
table, seems overwrought, if not contradictory. On the 
v^hole, such ultimate and snatch-admixtures, in the shape of 
sauces, cream, milk, wine, to gravy-soups, appear to us to 
be bad traditions from times when the thinness of broth 
required hiding by spicy and distracting additions. 

The Principal Constituents of Meat as Sources of Culinary 

Educts. 

The savoury extract of meat, which after exposure to 
high temperature forms the osmazome of brown gravy, is 
contained in the little cylindrical bags of the muscles which 
hold the discs or fibres of contractile substance. It may 
be either the matter from which the contractile matter takes 
its nutriment, or it may be matter already used for con- 
traction, and destined next to be used for heat production ; 
or it may be a mixture of such matters. They have some 
distant similarities to 'peptones, the substances produced 
from white of egg, fibrin, syntonin, etc., by digestion; they 
are alkaloids by their reaction, and iveak acids at the same 
time. By this chemical function, which pronounces them 
to belong to a class of bodies having powerful effects upon 
the nervous system, these bodies are distinguished from the 
more neutral substances of the soluble albuminous series. 
The main substance of the muscle or flesh considered as an 
organ and as food is muscle fibrin or syntonin, the con- 
tractile matter just mentioned. This by itself is as taste- 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 123 

less as white of Qg%^ and receives its flavour from the 
osmazome vpith which it is surrounded. It is during Hfe in 
a pecuUar irritable condition, which enables it to alternately 
contract and relax its particles ; this irritability ceases soon 
after death, and passes into a condition of hard, stable con- 
traction, or rigor, the first phenomenon of absolute somatic 
death, hence called rigor mortis, h cook may have occa- 
sion to take heed of this phenomenon for the following 
reason : If meat be set to cook, boil, or roast, before the 
rigor has set in, while it is yet warm and quivering imme- 
diately after the killing of the animal, it may become as 
tender, if it was otherwise of good quality, as meat which 
has been long hung ; but meat in the state of rigor mortis 
will nearly always become hard or tough during cooking. 
In practice meat is therefore allowed to hang exposed to 
fresh cold air at least until the rigor mortis has disappeared, 
and the flesh has become flexible or soft. While so ex- 
posed, meat breathes — that is to say, takes in oxygen of the 
air and gives out carbonic acid, just as if it were endowed 
with lungs or respiratory organs. Amongst the manifold 
changes engendered by this breathing or oxygenation, one is 
very prominent as preliminary to roasting or boiling, namely, 
the production or increase of a quantity of lactic acid ; as 
this acid is not quite identical with the acid produced during 
the souring of milk, it is termed paralactic acid, and as it 
reacts upon polarized light, it is also termed optically active 
lactic acid, and as derived from flesh, sarcolactic acid. This 
acid does not only contribute to make the meat more tasty, 
but it also helps to make it more tender, by exercising a 
solvent effect upon the fibrous and tendinous parts. This 
solvent action also belongs to other organic acids, e.g., acetic 
acid, or vinegar, and is at times made use of to make naturally 
hard and tough meat quite tender. 

Another important substance with which the contractile 
fibres of coloured flesh are soaked is the red colouring matter 



124 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

myochrome ; this is identical with the colouring matter of 
blood, or heiiiocJirome, and, although differently arranged, 
has the same function, namely, that of fixing or holding 
oxygen, and giving it up again when it is wanted for the 
chemical action of the muscles. When it is heated it 
coagulates like white of egg, though only at a much higher 
temperature, and changes its colour to reddish-brown. 
White meat so called, e.g., the flesh of young animals, 
lambs, calves, and the breasts of domestic birds, contain 
but little of this myochrome, and great care is taken to keep 
this meat as white as possible, either by bleeding the animals 
with particular care, or by draining their bodies of all blood 
by long suspension. 

Blood is not capable of giving a savoury extract, although 
the blood of each species of eatable animals has a particular 
flavour, that of the ox and cow particularly of musk. When 
blood is used for cooking, e.g., in sausages called * black 
puddings,' the addition of several spices is necessary to 
overcome the alkaline flatness and absence of savour. 

Another ingredient of flesh is albumin, coagulable by heat, 
like white of egg, but differing from the latter in some pro- 
perties ; it is identical with the colourless albumin of blood 
and lymph, and is hence termed serum- alhumin. It is 
tasteless, and is thus only a nutritive, and not a flavour- 
yielding, material. Next we have in muscle connective-tissue, 
or collagen substance, which forms the sheath of the con- 
tractile fibres, binds them together in smaller and larger 
bundles, and supplies to most muscles not only white 
tendinous envelopes, so-called aponeurotic fascicB, but also 
white and mostly attenuated tendinous attachments, or 
thin long outrunners called tendons. All the hgaments by 
which the joints are held together, and all the membranes 
by which bodies and organs are covered, and the latter are 
suspended in the bodies, consist of the collagen substance. 
It is called collagen because by long boiling with water it is 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 125 

transformed into colla, or glue, being the hydrated form of a 
substance which, when dry, is called gelatine. Meat yields 
some gelatin to water when it is boiled, the more the longer 
the boiling is continued. But when it is desired to produce 
gelatinous matters (jellies) in the kitchen, it is never ad- 
visable to use either meat or bones for that purpose, but 
calves' feet, which, with the exception of the bones and 
cartilages, will dissolve almost entirely in water by long 
boiUng and form neutral or tasteless jelly. 



Proportion of Bones to Meat in Various Animals. 

We come now to the consideration of the hones of meat. 
In good veal we have on the average twelve parts of bone in 
fifty-eight parts of joint as bought ; in beef, ten parts of bone 
in fifty of joint ; therefore in these two kinds of meat a fifth of 
the weight at least is bone ; but in several joints the weight 
of the bone rises to one-fourth : in lamb the proportion is a 
little different, the bones being to flesh as eight to thirty- 
seven (17*7 per cent.) ; in fat sheep, as seven to thirty (nearly 
19 per cent.) ; here the meat is a little more than five times 
the weight of the bones. In these estimates all visible fat 
is excluded. In fat pork bones are to flesh as seven to thirty- 
eight, therefore less than one-sixth (seven out of forty-five), 
fat again excluded. 

In many culinary operations the connection of the bone 
with the meat is of great advantage to the latter, e.g., in 
mutton chops, saddle of mutton, loin of beef, etc. During 
the roasting the bone protects the meat on one side from 
drying, while admitting the heat. But in the process of 
boiling the presence of bone is of no advantage whatever ; 
in particular, bone and its surroundings, not being meat, 
contribute nothing to the flavour of the joint or the broth, 
and very little to its nutritious qualities, and therefore all 
bones should as far as possible be kept away, or removed 



126 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



from joints about to be boiled, as has been already shown 
above in the history of Proust's extract of meat. 

In many kitchens it is usual to break the bones which 
have been removed from any * boned ' joints, enclose them 
in a bag of netting, and boil them either by themselves or 
in the stock-pot ; all skeletons of chickens, pheasants, par- 
tridges, hares, rabbits, whether obtained by boning in the 
kitchen or left from the table, are by all cookery-books made 
the basis of some sort of broth, gravy, or sauce {fumet). Let 
it be well understood that such remains are only useful to 
the extent to which they consist of meat ; as bones they are 
perfectly useless, and, in fact, mostly give rise to voluminous 
operations, the dilute results of which have to be concen- 
trated by hours of evaporation or boiling down, and even 
then would not be worth having if they were not strongly 
supported by the fried vegetables and their extracts which 
are always needed as well. No doubt gelatine can be 
slowly extracted from bones by boiling them with water, 
but the product is both costly and useless. Therefore 
we conclude our remarks with the observation that the 
traditional worship of bones is a mischievous superstition 
which should be eliminated from culinary literature and 
practice."^ 

Fat of Meat, and its Proportions in Various Animals. 

The fat of animal bodies is contained in small sacs of 
collagenous tissue ; some of these burst during the applica- 
tion of heat, and the fat is set free ; others of stronger con- 
struction resist both boiling and roasting for some time, 
until the envelope is transformed into gelatine; then the 

* Voce 'Worship of Bones.' ' I remember, ' says ' Wy vern ' [loc. cit., 
p. 27), 'an article headed "Curry and Kice " which once appeared in a 
London weekly periodical. Judging from the writer's suggestions as to the 
cookery of a tin of beef with yams, and, worse still, the fabrication of soup 
from the /owl-bones you picked and left at luncheon, I should say that the 
periodical had picked up, not only an ignoramus, but an uncleanly igno- 
ramus, as a contributor.' 



BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 127 

fat flows out, and the membrane sinks to the bottom : such 
browned membranes are termed greaves or grieves. Care 
should be taken by cooks that the fat which they leave on 
joints to be roasted or boiled be of good taste ; thus some fat 
of sheep has naturally a tallowy taste, and requires to be 
eliminated. The fat of some fishes, e.g., herrings, sprats, 
has at times a taste of train-oil, which can only be removed 
by grilling the fish. 

Veal contains the least amount of fat, less than one 
quarter of the weight of the flesh ; a/ai ox has from twenty 
to twenty -five parts of fat upon forty parts of pure muscular 
tissue, or more than half the weight of the flesh ; a fat sheep 
has more fat (thirty-two) than flesh (thirty) ; a /a^ hog 
similarly will show fat to muscle as forty to thirty-seven. 
Of fish, salmon, eels, and sprats are distinguished by much 
fat ; cod, turbot, sole, by the minimum of fat as compared 
to flesh ; the liver of the cod, on the other hand, is very rich 
in fat. The large marine mammals, such as ivhales, are 
reservoirs of enormous masses of fat, and this becomes the 
cause of their gradual extinction by man's hands. A chicken 
01c pheasant may be fattened up so as to contain 10 per cent. 
of fat ; partridges never have more than, and seldom as 
much as, IJ per cent, of fat. Geese, by cramming, can be 
made to accumulate considerable masses of fat under their 
skin, in the abdominal cavity, and in the liver. 

Note on the History of Researches concerning Gelatine and 
its Use for Food, and of the Romance of the Bouillon d'Os. 

The earliest scientific note on gelatine occurs in D. Papin's 
work."^ He obtained gelatine by boiling bones in his 
digester, i.e., under pressure, and therefore under higher 
temperatures than that of boiling water; when the heat 
was too great the gelatine was weaker, and, as he believed, 

"" Papin, Denys, ' The Manner of softening Bones and cooking all Sorts 
of Meat in a Short Time, and at little Cost.' 1682. 



128 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



less nourishing. He obtained gelatine from the jack (fish), 
but not from the mackerel. Cartilage was dissolved almost 
entirely, and yielded a strong gelatine. 

The name gelatina was first employed by Spielmann, in 
1766, in his chemical essays,* and in French by Koussille 
Chamseru.t The English physician Bostock was the first 
to estimate the quantity of gelatine required to make water 
gelatinize ; he found the minimum to be 1 per cent. 

Herissant, in 1758, undertook a remarkable research on 
bones. He steeped them in a mixture of four parts of water 
and one part of fuming nitric acid, and found that after a 
time they had lost their hardness, and were represented by 
an insoluble matter which had retained the shape of the 
bones, was flexible and of organic nature; a calcareous 
matter had dissolved in the acid ; it was not then diagnosed 
as phosphate and carbonate of lime, but the fact was proved 
that bone consists of an organized tissue and a calcareous 
matter. 

In 1766 Herissant extended these inquiries to the shells 
of molluscs living on the earth, or in fresh or salt water, 
and to madrepores and corals. 

In 1775 Changeux published, in the Joiirn. cle PJiysiqiie, 
an extensive article ' on a mode of extracting alimentary 
matters from several substances in which they were not 
known to exist,' etc. According to him some spoonfuls of 
powdered bone of the ox or calf, boiled for an hour with 
water, ' should yield an enormous quantity of jelly, as 
savoury and restorative as the jelly of meat.* 

In 1791 Proust perceived that the substance which yields 
gelatine exists in flesh and bone, and that although it is 
present in flesh in much smaller quantities than in bone, it 
is much more easily dissolved out of flesh than it is out of 
bone, in which latter it is hardened and compressed in cells 
impregnated with bone -earth. He compared the quantity 

•'■ ' Annotationes Chemicee.' f Journ. Gen. de MM. lix. 120. 



BOUILLON D'OS 129 



of gelatine obtainable from powdered bone on the one hand, 
and from merely roughly-broken bone on the other ; he 
found that the qualities of gelatine obtained from different 
parts of the same skeleton were not identical : that from 
ribs was better than that from pelvic bones ; jelly from 
mutton bones had the flavour of mutton. 

Proust also studied the extraction of fat from hones. The 
hardest bones contained 0-05 per cent, of fat at the outside, 
others yielded 0-125, and others even 0*25 per cent."^ For 
the extraction of the fat the bones, broken into rough pieces, 
have to be boiled in water ; they must not be powdered, as 
the fat remains adherent to the powder, and does not rise 
on the water. (Calcined magnesia has a similar detaining 
effect upon lard.) 

These observations of Proust were given in a separate 
publication, of which ten years later, in 1801, he published 
an abstract.! 

In 1803 Cadet Devaux published a brochure on gelatine. | 
This author, one of the so-called ' philanthropists ' of that 
period, exhibited a tendency to imposture by speaking of 
gelatine as if it were his own discovery ; he intentionally 
did not read, he alleged, the essays on gelatine of his pre* 
decessors, for fear that their ideas might ' chain up and 
paralyze his own thoughts.' Only in 1818 he mentioned 
Papin, and called his digester * a volcano - hydraulic 
machine,' and declared it unsuitable for the extraction of 
gelatine from bone. The dog, he averred, discovered the 
utility of bone for alimentation ; he, Devaux, only imitated 
the dog by breaking, dividing, and moistening bones. He

least fifteen hours, distributed over three days, the cooks in the camp at

130 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

proved to his satisfaction bones to be nutritive by allowing 
dogs the choice between soup and bones : the animals chose 
the bones and left the soup. He pulverized bones (against 
which Proust had warned), and called this the * solution of 
the Gordian knot ' and the ' egg of Columbus.' But this 
was a mere filch from Changeux. 

Proust reduced all meat- jellies to a constant degree of 
dryness ; he proposed that they should be used by mariners, 
travellers, and explorers of new countries, and enable every- 
body to produce immediately bouillon for kitchen, hospital, 
and poor-house. Devaux had declared the bouillon of meat 
to be ' a black, salt, acrid juice, which heats the mouth and 
decomposes,' while the bone-bouillon was to be in every 
respect superior. Proust refuted Devaux at length, and did 
too much honour to this vapouring charlatan ; but the 
charlatan all the same received the felicitations of learned 
societies, generals, prefects, princes of Germany, and other 
• philanthropists ' ; even his Holiness the Pope blessed him 
with his own hand, as a friend of humanity, and told him 
that at Pome he, the Pope, had eleven establishments for 
the production of ' bone-broth ' (evidently destitute soup- 
kitchens). Proust advised Devaux to put all his letters and 
compliments into a fascicle, and mark it on the outside : 
' Matters about which I know nothing.' 

But the * science ' blessed as philanthropic by a Pope had 
the usual vitality of error. Devaux in 1828 published a new 
pamphlet of 112 pages.* Gelatine is there described as 
being amongst nutriments what gold is amongst metals ; 
its bouillon is good for all ages and conditions, for the 
animal body consists entirely of gelatine ; but meat-broth 
frequently aggravates illness, and is not even good for 
convalescents. A hundredweight of bones represent by 
the gelatine which they contain that amount of gelatine 

* 'De la gelatine des os et de son bouillon,' dedicated to the Due de 
Berri. 



BOUILLON D' OS 131 



which is given by six hundredweight of meat ; meat ex- 
hausted of its juice is mere rubbish ; it is the gelatine only, 
dissolved in a bouillon of meat or of bone, which constitutes 
the aliment in these preparations. This proposition, that 
meat was nutritious only by its gelatine, is as absurd as the 
contention about the relative value of meat and bone broth. 
But the very absurdity of the propositions, backed by the 
evident cheapness of their execution, brought to Devaux, 
besides, and in consequence of the Papal blessing, the notice 
and approval of the French King Louis XVII T. The 
bureau de charlte of the first arrondissement of Paris had 
formed an institution clu bouillon cl'os, and its Maire pre- 
sented a report on this to the King when the latter visited 
the place. S. A. E. Madame and the princes being present 
on this occasion, the King said to Devaux : ' I rejoice in the 
success of this institution, and it is to you, sir, that 
humanity will be indebted for it.' This was the King on 
whose table there appeared daily sixty different dishes, and 
who kept tasting committees even for the fruit to be placed 
upon his table. He never ate bouillon cl'os, and, like the 
charity of many of the patrons of good kitchens, his charity 
to the poor included this practical sneer of a decoction of 
bones. 

D'Arcet, who had probably some views in common with 
Devaux, applied himself principally to the production of the 
bouillon cl'os by the treatment of bones with steam, under a 
pressure slightly exceeding that of the atmosphere. Sub- 
sequently he adopted the process of Herissant, substituting 
hydrochloric for nitric acid, and dissolving the gelatinogenous 
tissue, which was insoluble in acid, in boiling water. Al- 
though Devaux used the publications of previous inquirers on 
gelatine without any acknowledgment, yet from ignorance 
of all principles of science he misinterpreted their results, and 
came to entirely fallacious conclusions. D'Arcet was more 
practical, and advised that all gelatine for the kitchen and 



132 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

all glue for the arts should be made from bones, freed from 
phosphatic earth by hydrochloric acid. But he seems to 
have shared to a large extent the errors of Devaux, and 
although he was in his confidence provoked a concurrence 
{i.e., competition) of his (D'Arcet's) gelatine with the 
houillon d'os. He recommended"^ the use of gelatine made 
by this process for the preparation of soup in hospitals, 
poor-houses, and dispensaries, and to reduce the meat by 
three - quarters of its former weight ; he pretended to 
replace (!) every pound of meat by 5 gros of gelatine, but 
added ' vegetables.' The following were the proportions of 
ingredients : 50 litres of water, 12 lb. of meat, 4J lb. of dry 
gelatine, 4 lb. of salt, 16 to 20 lb. of vegetables and spices ; 
total, 192 rations of bouillon, at the cost of 8 c. each, 4 fr. 
being allowed for the value of the boiled meat (bouilli). 
Differences of opinion on the' quality of such broth led to 
its abandonment.! 

Chevreul properly taxed Devaux with using illogical argu- 
ment in this, that he condemned all broth and bouilli of 
meat, but recommended roast meat, and yet the bouillon 
and bouilli together as eaten do not contain more gelatine 
than the roast meat. How can it be explained, exclaimed 
this savant, that a man of such inferior quality as Cadet 
Devaux can reap such external success from all classes, 
municipalities, princes. King, and Pope ? It was, he 
replied, because his sham science proceeded under the 
mask of ijhilanthroinc iyrofcssio7is , which all these patrons 
made it a business ostentatiously to support. 

In 1831 the Academy of Sciences of Paris appointed a 
commission consisting of Magendie, Serres, Dupuytren, 
D'Arcet, Chevreul, Flourens, and Serullas. Its first per- 
formance was an examination of the Bouillon de la 
Compacjiiie Hollandaise, founded by MM. Bouwens and

Van Copenael, already mentioned above. The chemical 
examination was given to Chevreul, and he also was made 
reporter. D'Arcet resigned his seat on the commission on 
September 23, 1831, in consequence of differences with his 
colleagues. Experiments had been made of which the com- 
mission were left uninformed. Chevreul, who was offended 
thereby, resigned his post as reporter shortly afterwards. 
There being then a good understanding between D'Arcet 
and Magendie, the former was desirous of getting Magendie 
appointed reporter. This was effected, but science proved 
stronger than intrigue, and the commission ended in the 
celebrated report to the effect that gelatine was non- 
nutritious, because dogs who had only glue to eat died, 
the devoured gelatine notwithstanding, of starvation. The 
unanimous report of the commission was read to the 
Academy on March 19, 1832. The fallacy involved in 
Magendie's experiments was discovered only forty years 
later. 

Payen made some researches on the gelatinogen (left by 
hydrochloric acid and called cartilage) of the bones of horses. 
Just as the fats of different parts of the body have different 
temperatures of fusibility, so the bones of horses give 
different amounts and qualities of gelatine ; with age the 
gelatinogenous tissue seems to diminish. 

Chevreul believed that future generations of readers 
would be astonished that gelatine should have given rise 
to such long debates in the Academy. He gives credit to 
physicians for having been but of one opinion regarding the 
effect of bouillon d'os on the sick in hospitals. These latter 
were the only persons on whom this ' charity ' could be 
inflicted. No person with sound sense and taste would 
consent to drink the bouillon cVos."^ 

* The foregoing follows mainly a discourse delivered by Chevreul in 
1870, and reported in Gr. Grimaud de Caux's work, ' L'Academie d. 
Sciences pendant le Siege de Pari?!,' 1871. In this discourse Proust's 
claim to the discovery of the true nature of the bouillon d'os was for the

CHAPTER VII, 



THE PRACTICE OF PRODUCING BROTHS, GRAVIES, 
AND CONSOMMES OF BEEF, VEAL, MUTTON, 
FOWL, AND GAME, AND THEIR USE WITH 
SOUPS AND SAUCES. 

General Observations. 

We have in the previous chapter given the scientific imn- 
ciples on which all production of broth for culinary use 
ought to be based. We have fully described the standard 
by which all such production should be measured and com- 
pared, and which may be applied to all recipes used in any 
kitchen, even co those w^hich are destined to be superseded. 
The present chapter is a practical supplement to the previous 
one, inasmuch as it will form a transition to the actual pro- 
duction of soups and sauces, by giving the actual rules and 
recipes for the composing of any kind of broth, be it in the 
smallest household or the largest establishment. They are, 
of course, given as alternatives to be used on demand, in 
cases in which the use of extract of meat is for some reason 
or other excluded. In this relation it must be borne in 
mind that standard broth from extract, or an equally strong 
broth obtained by extracting meat with boiling water 
directly, is only material for the production of gravy and 
consomme, which latter when desired for use must under all 
circumstances be produced in the kitchen, and cannot at 
present be bought ready-made. We therefore repeat their 
definitions : Gravy is a watery solution of extract of meat 
which has been browned by the influence of heat upon the 

first time advanced in literature. Proust's claim to the discovery of 
extract of meat in its true pure form was recognised by myself in the 
course of the studies for this work. 



BROTH, GRAVY, CONSOMME 135 

extract, while it was in a nearly dry state ; this change 
from broth to gravy is analogous to that which sugar under- 
goes when it becomes caramel. Consomme, on the other 
hand, means the product obtained from a watery extract of 
meat and vegetables, properly spiced and salted, by reduction 
or evaporation to such a consistency that it has obtained 
the mixed character of both broth and gravy combined. In 
many older and even some so-called modern cookery-books 
so-called consommes are made to rise from very dilute 
liquids, and require many hours of boiling before they 
become sufficiently ' consumed ' to be eatable or applicable 
to further preparation. This long boiling was not only 
costly, but destructive of much quality, and it is one of the 
principal objects of modern culinary art as advocated in 
this treatise to limit as much as possible the necessity for 
such long evaporation by making the extracts as concen- 
trated from the beginning as may be needed for their 
immediate application. 

Gravy-Broth (Empotage or Consomme) for Soups and Sauces 
in General (Grand Consomme pour Potage et Sauce). 

Definition. — The preparation here to be considered is the 
evaporated extract from beef and veal, with the addition of 
some smaller animals for variation of taste, flavoured with 
roots, rhizomes, and green condiments. The quantities are 
adapted to large establishments. 

Becipe. — Put into a stock-pot 30 lb. of gravy-beef, 20 lb. 
of knuckle of veal, four wild rabbits, an old hen (and two 
partridges, if in season), all cut small ; cover the meat with 
standard broth, and boil the whole, skimming it until the 
liquid be reduced to a light-coloured glace ; then fill up 
again with standard broth, and add carrots, turnips, leeks, 
onions, celery, two blades of mace, and six cloves, but only 
little salt. Boil the whole for several hours to extract the 
vegetables, then press the meat, pass the broth through a 



136 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

silk tammy, or a napkin, into pans, and place it in the 
larder for use. 

This consomme may be used for sauces directly, but is a 
great deal too strong for soups ; to be used in these it 
requires dilution with at least two parts of water or thin 
stock, so as to constitute one-third of the volume of the 
finished soup. Such good soup as this is practically no- 
where obtained except in philosophical households which 
conserve atavistic traditions ; more particularly, it is never 
obtained in the modern restaurant or hotel or club, where, 
on the contrary, some very dilute colour and tasteless liquids 
are given out in soup-plates under the completely false name 
of consomme ; when made into thick soup with any puree or 
flour, the broth disappears as well, and the result is non- 
descript insipidity. 

To this recipe we have further to observe that the beef 
and veal, in order to be extracted completely, should be 
passed through the mincing-machine, either raw, before 
going into the stock-pot, or after it has been boiled to facili- 
tate the mincing, and should be pressed in a screw press 
after the consomme has been filtered off. The bones of the 
knuckles of veal might be removed before boiling to save 
space. We may assume that the whole of the meat will 
amount to 47 lb., out of 58 lb. with bones ; if twenty quarts 
of standard broth be added at the beginning, and twenty for 
dilution of the consomme, there ought to result at least forty 
quarts, or ten gallons of consomme, allowing all the water 
furnished by the meat to have evaporated.. These forty 
quarts would represent the extract of 127 lb. of meat, with 
the extracts of the vegetables, the quantities of which are 
not prescribed, added. If the proportion prescribed for 
the French household i^oi - an -feu discussed below were 
observed, the compound would require at least a hundred- 
weight of vegetables, but practically nothing like this 
quantity is ever taken. One pint of the consomme, diluted 



BROTH, GRAVY, CONSOMME 137 

with two pints of water, would, with the addition required 
to speciahze the product, make excellent soup for four 
persons. If all the consomme were then transformed into 
soup, it would be sufficient for 240 persons, each person 
thus receiving the absolute soluble extract of half a pound 
of meat in a highly attractive and digestible form. 

Beef-Gravy, or Common (Brown) Gravy. 

This preparation passed in French magirism under the 
name of Jus de Bceuf* and was to be used to ' colour ' soups, 
sauces, entremets, and entries which require j'/^s, i.e., gravy. 
The expression * colour ' here means the imparting not only 
of a tint perceptible by the eye, but particularly a savoury 
character and taste similar to that of the gravy of roast 
meat. 

Fuse some butter over the bottom of a stewpan, and 
cover it with thin slices of bacon or of beef suet ; over this 
place some thin slices of onions and carrots, and then some 
pounds of minced gravy-beef ; fry this mixture gently with 
constant stirring, and when it is light brown add a quart 
of standard broth, and boil briskly. When the broth is 
reduced to a glace, put the stewpan on a moderate fire, and 
allow the glace to acquire a deep red-brown colour ; then 
fill up again with standard broth ; add some parsley, celery, 
mushroom, or its ketchup, some cloves, some blades of mace, 
a few pepper-corns, or their equivalent of tincture, and a 
little salt. Boil the mixture, skim it, let it simmer until 
all the vegetable be done; then strain it through a silk 
tammy into another stewpan, and use it for the purposes 
indicated. 

In case you desire to use any portion for clear soup, or for 
a clear aspic, the gravy has to be clarified. This clarifica- 

* Gf. Beauvilliers, loc. cit., i. 32 ; repr. Francatelli 221, partly. It will 
be noticed that no precise weights of the ingredients, particularly of meat, 
are given. 



138 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

tion is always effected at the expense of a good deal of 
flavour, and of course of work, and should be dispensed 
with by all persons who value taste before appearance. It 
may be effected as follows : Beat three whites of egg into a 
froth, and incorporate it with the glace ; add some lemon- 
juice; whisk the mixture over the fire until the white of 
egg is well curdled ; set aside for a quarter of an hour, then 
strain through a cloth into a basin, and keep for use. 

In this recipe the browning of the broth, by which it 
becomes gravy, is effected at two periods — once during the 
frying of the meat, and a second time during the evapora- 
tion to a glace of a deep red-brown colour. If six pints of 
standard broth were used to immerse 14 lb. of meat, and 
another six to dilute the consomme, there should be obtained 
eight or ten pints of gravy, supposing the meat to have been 
pressed in a screws-press. This would be ready for sauces, 
but for soups would require dilution to a volume of twelve 
quarts ; each pint would then contain the soluble extract of 
\ lb. of beef, and the quantity would be sufficient to yield 
excellent soup for forty-eight persons. 



Beef-broth from the Pot-au-Feu of Smaller French 
Households. 

The name of imt-au-feu, as used in older French culinary 
writings, applies to a mixture of various kinds of meat and 
vegetables all stewed together after the manner of the 
ancient oille, or olla of the Spaniards. But the name as 
here used applies to a mixture of beef and vegetables boiled 
with a relatively large amount of water, the main object 
being evidently the production of a considerable amount of 
l)roth to be further developed into soup. We quote recipes 
in themselves very old, to show that they are still in use 
with all their virtues and faults unaltered ; one is for a 
l)ot-au-fcii wdth about 3 11), of beef, called tlie huye ; and 



POr-AU-FEU 139 



another with 1^ lb. of beef, called tlie small.'^ We give the 
quantities in grammes of the original : 

{a) Larger pot-au-feu : Meat, 1 kilo 500 grm. ; bones, 
400 grm, ; water, 8 litres ; salt, 60 grm. ; carrots, 300 grm. ; 
onions, 300 grm. ; leeks, 400 grm.; celery, 25 grm. ; cloves, 2; 
turnips, 300 grm. ; parsnips, 50 grm. 

(h) Small pot-au-feu. • Meat, 750 grm. ; bones, 125 grm., 
or about the quantity which generally accompanies the 
meat — that is to say, imposed by the butcher on the pur- 
chaser; water, 4 litres; salt, 30 grm.; carrots, 150 grm.; 
onions, 150 grm. ; leeks, 200 grm. ; celery, 10 grm. ; clove, 1 ; 
turnips, 150 grm. ; parsnips, 25 grm. 

Practical Consideration of these Becipes. — We should 
exclude the bones from both recipes as mere encum- 
brances and perfectly useless. Now, as 750 grm. of beef 
in 4,000 grm. of water (or IJ kilos in 8 litres) give a very 
weak broth, this deficiency has to be covered by the 
addition of large quantities of vegetables, the sum of the 
weight of which stands to the weight of the meat in the 
proportion of 6 to 7. Owing to the large quantity of these 
vegetable ingredients, the soup will be good to eat notwith- 
standing its weakness as regards meat-extract, but will be 
strongly flavoured with onion and leek, and the meat will be 
much exhausted, and require some tasty garnishings to make 
it palatable. The small pot-au-feu is said to be sufficient 
for four or five persons, or for two or three on two succeed- 
ing days. 

The meat will probably not yield to the water more than 
one-third of its osmazome, or savoury extractive, equal to 
that of half a pound of flesh, or a quarter of an ounce of 
mercantile extract. Our standard broth, however, contains 
half an ounce in the pint, therefore four ounces to the four 
litres ; the small pot-au-feu thus yields a broth which, 
as regards meat-extract, contains only one-sixteenth the 
" Cf. Gouffe, loc. cit., p. 41. 



HO THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

proportion which is contained in our standard broth. It 
is not improbable that the cost of the vegetables, bought 
retail, will amount to nearly (in London it would amount 
to more than) the cost of the meat. The nutritive value of 
the vegetables would be very small as compared to that of an 
equal money-value of meat. On the whole, therefore, the 
pot-au-feu, as above directed to be made, is an expensive 
dish, however well it may suit those who seek the satis- 
faction from meals more in formality than in actual re- 
stocking of the physical powers. Gouffe'" gives some 
technical directions for the manner in which the boiling of 
the pot-au-feu is to be conducted. Firstly, the lid of the 
boiler is not to be closed * hermetically,* because this would 
cause the broth to be turbid ; but an opening is to be left 
two fingers in width ; then the boiling is to be interrupted 
three times by the addition of three decilitres of cold water 
to the large, and one decilitre to the small boiling-pot, and 
the scum is to be removed with the skimming-ladle each 
time. At this stage the vegetables are to be added, the 
pot is to be heated to ebullition, and then allowed to 
simmer on a moderate fire until all be done. You have 
next to remove the meat, which had been boned and tied 
up with a string before being placed above the bone in the 
water ; you are then to take out the vegetables as soon as 
they are cooked, as they are said to take away much of the 
savour of the broth if allowed to remain too long in it. 
While the pot is boiling after the removal of meat and 
vegetables, you are to remove the grease from the top with 
the spoon provided to that end. You are to colour the 
bouillon, not with baked onions, or burnt carrots, or 
so-called colouring balls, but with caramel made from 
sugar by the cook's own hand. Of the watery solution 
of caramel (made from h lb. of sugar, then dissolved in 
2 lb. of water, and kept in bottles) you add a few drops to

BOUILLON AND BOUILLI 141 



the soup, when it is akeady in the tureen ready to be 
served; never add the colouring to the bouillon in the 
stock-pot, as it becomes disqualified for other purposes. 
The boiling of the meat is to be continued until it be cooked, 
v^hich is to be ascertained by probing it v^ith a long needle, 
or steel skewer, or fork ; the cooking of the small pot is not 
to exceed four, that of the large five, hours. If the boiling 
were to be continued beyond this, the broth, it is alleged, 
would lose in quality. 

Dietetic Value of Bouillon and Bouilli obtained in these 
Processes. 

There can be little doubt that these processes given under 
the title of imt-au-feu were designed more with a view of 
obtaining a considerable quantity of well-tasting thin broth, 
made attractive by masses of vegetables and green condi- 
ments, than that of preparing a well-tasting piece of beef ; 
for the boiling during four hours of IJ lb. of meat in four- 
fifths of a gallon (8 lb.) of water cannot possibly give an 
attractive result. The great fault of the recipes, then, is the 
excess of water in which the relative quantities of meat are 
to be boiled. If each quantity of meat were boiled in an 
equal weight of water, a much better result would be 
obtained as regards the broth as well as the meat. The 
consequence of this false practice has been that this 
boiled fresh beef, which the French term bouilli, has fallen 
into great and entirely undeserved disrepute. Thirty years 
ago every dinner in a good private house or hotel on the 
Continent began with soup, and upon this followed the 
boiled beef ; at the present time the boiled beef is rarely 
met with. No doubt the beef was not always prime, or the 
meat was from a cow or heifer, and pale and tasteless ; 
but these aberrations detract nothing from the excellent 
quality of a well-boiled side, or rib, of beef. No doubt also 
that book-lore, which the travelling public partly forms its 



142 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

opinion by, had a share in this change. Thus Brillat- 
Savarin wrote that bouiUi was a wholesome, digestible 
nutriment, but of small restorative power, as it had lost 
some of the animalizable juices by boiling. He describes 
four categories of benighted persons who eat houilli, while 
professors (of the physiology of taste, we suppose) never eat 
it, because it i^ flesh without its juice. The assertion that 
a wholesome, digestible nutriment possessed small restora- 
tive power would be physiologically speaking untenable. 
But what the writer meant by restorative power was not 
the mere food-value, but the value of the pleasure of the 
good taste of the morsel as well. As applicable to the 
result of Gouffe's recipes we agree with Savarin, and advise 
our readers to supplant these recipes by better ones. 

Instantaneous Broths, or Bouillon a la Minute. 

The same author, Goufie, who has given such elaborate 
directions for the x^ot-au-feu, brings under the chapter on 
soups (p. 51) a recipe for instantaneous broth, or Bouillon 
a la Mimtte, which is in so far phenomenal, as it accom- 
plishes, not in a minute or instantaneously, but in twenty 
minutes or half an hour, what other recipes do in four or 
five hours only — e.g., in cases of illness — where, as Gouffe 
says, expense is a secondary question. 

Cut up 1 lb. (J kilo) of very lean beef (gravy-beef) and 
half a boned chicken ; pound all V7ell, put it into a casserole 
with 10 grs. of salt, pour over it 1^ litre, or 3 pints, of 
water, and heat to boiling while stirring. As soon as the 
boiling has commenced, add shred carrots, turnips, onions, 
leeks, and celery ; boil for twenty minutes, and pass through 
a cloth. This is a perfectly rational proceeding : bones are 
omitted, fat is excluded, the meat is comminuted and per- 
fectly exhausted, the boiling is confined to twenty minutes. 
This is, indeed, the process to be applied for the production 
of broth of unvarying strength. If the beef be omitted, 



VEAL GRAVY'BROTH 143 



and half an ounce of its extract substituted, and the solution 
be boiled with the pounded half-fowl and the green condi- 
ments, an equally good broth will be obtained. 

Veal Gravy-Broth, or Blond de Veau in Literature. 

Voltaire wrote from Cirey to his friend St. Lambert : 
* Come to Cirey, where Madame Duchatelet will prevent 
your being poisoned; there is not even a spoonful oiju^ in the 
kitchen, all is done here with hlond de veau ; we are going 
to live a hundred years. '^ The recipe for this hlond de veau 
had been given to Madame Duchatelet by the celebrated 
Tronchin, whose hygienic principles were comprised in 
these three recommendations : ' Keep your head cool, 
your feet warm, and your bowels open.' Compare with 
this the old English veal-broth recommended by Ignotus, 
quoted below. But first let us consider the classic 
recipe. 

Blond de Veau a la Duchatelet, by Tronchin. 

Put into a casserole butter or lard, slices of veal, and 
pieces of fowl, and fry the mixture; add onions, carrots, 
a bouquet of herbs, and a pint of bouillon (!); let the 
liquid boil down to a glace without allowing it to catch 
{i.e,, adhere, by burning, to the bottom of the casserole) ; 
then fill up again with bouillon (!), boil and skim, and let 
simmer for two hours. Make a white roux, and fry some 
mushrooms (champignons) in it for some minutes ; then 
add the broth and bind it intimately ; boil and skim, keep 
on a mild fire to collect the grease, and pass through a 
tammy. 

Considering that this hlond de veau, for which no 
quantities of either veal or fowl are given, is to be filled 
up twice with * a pint of bouillon,' the statement of 

* Of. D.D., 250. 



144 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Voltaire, that it was made without jus, is to some extent 
erroneous. 

Veal Gravy-Broth, or Blond de Veau. 

Butter the bottom of a stewpan, put in some slices of 
ham, 4 lb. or 5 lb. of veal, well minced, a couple of wild 
rabbits, two carrots and onions, and let all sweat over a 
mild tire ; add a pint of standard broth, and reduce by 
boiling to the state of glace ; when it has a nice yellow 
colour remove it from the fire ; moisten again with standard 
broth (grand bouillon) ; now add parsley, shallots (half a 
clove of garlic), two cloves ; boil, skim, remove grease, pass 
through a tammy, and use the blond as you would empotage 
for rice, vermicelli, and sauces, such as Espagnole, and 
even for excellent soup. 

French magiric authors do not prescribe mincing the veal, 
but order the cook to jiric'k the slices, after the glace is 
obtained, to let out all the juice which they contain ;* this 
very imperfect mode of extracting the veal we have super- 
seded by mincing and pressing it. 

Veal-Broth, Plain and Meagre, with Rice or Vermicelli. 

Stew a knuckle of veal in about a gallon of water, to 
which put 2 oz. of rice or vermicelli, a little salt, and a 
blade of mace. When the meat has become thoroughly 
boiled, and the liquid reduced to about one half, it may be 
sent to table, with or without the meat. Ignotus,t the 
magiric physician, recommends this simple broth to be 
used by all persons who are in the habit of indulging in 
rich soups (a danger not nowadays often to be apprehended) 
and highly-spiced dishes, to give their digestive organs an 
occasional relaxation.

MUTTON-BROTHS 145 



Mutton-Broth. 

General Ohservations. — On account of the somewhat pro- 
nounced flavour of some sorts of mutton, the broth made 
from that kind of meat is not so frequently used for the pro- 
duction of savoury dishes as beef. But the glace, or essence, 
or extract of mutton is even more savoury, and withal more 
refined, than extract of beef. But it is not so extensively 
brought into trade, simply because the production of essence 
of beef is somewhat cheaper than that of essence of mutton. 
What is called Scotch mutton-hroth is not a simple broth 
such as \ve are here discussing, but an expanded ragout of 
mutton chops or cutlets with barley and turnips. As Scot- 
land is the country where sheep thrive better than else- 
where, mutton is there such a constant household article 
of nutrition that Scotch broth is made to signify Scotch 
mutton hroth. It is also proper that mutton should be 
accompanied not only with barley, which is the principal 
cereal now grown in Scotland, and in its southern counties 
shares the arable surface with turnips, but also with turnips, 
upon which sheep have to live for a part of their existence, and 
from which they derive a part of the flavour of their meat. 

Recipe. — Trim a neck of mutton as for cutlets, and cut 
it into cutlets ; pare away all superfluous skin and excess 
of fat, and yellow elastic tissue or neck ligament ; place 
the cutlets in a stewpan with the outer part of two carrots, 
three turnips, two leeks, an onion, and a head of celery — all 
vegetables cut into very small dice. Have ready two quarts 
of mutton-broth, or standard beef-broth, and pour it over 
the cutlets ; add 6 oz. of Scotch barley, previously par- 
boiled. Boil the whole until the mutton, vegetables, and 
barley are properly cooked. Use salt sparingly, remove fat 
from the top of the broth, and point it with some chopped 
and blanched parsley. 

Some cooks make the broth which is to be poured over 

10 



146 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

the cutlets with the aid of the trimmings. Considering how 
small is the quantity of meat in them, it will be seen that 
they could yield only little of a weak broth, and the result 
would hardly be worth the trouble and cost of production. 
We find that for this and the hotch-potch next to be described 
the broth is best produced with Anderson's extract of mutton, 
which gives the finest mutton-tea that can be produced. 

Hotch-Potch. 

This name is generally spelled as in our title, and not 
]iodge-i)odge, as some writers have it. It is derived from the 
French hocliepot, from hocher, to shake, and jjot* The dish 
may be defined as * a confused mass of ingredients shaken 
and gently boiled together in the -same pot.' The French 
recipes contain no mutton nor mutton-broth ; but besides 
oxtail and slices of beef, ham, and a saveloy (sausage), a 
long list of vegetables — carrots, salsify, turnips, scorzonera 
(black salsify), topinambur, celery, red potatoes, and many 
onions. It is therefore a very general ragout soup, in which 
the meat has been, in Scotland, changed or limited to mutton. 
Produce the mutton-broth with chops or cutlets as in the 
previous recipe, and add thereto a pint and a half of tender 
green peas, preferably marrow-fats. Boil the soup until all 
the ingredients are done, and then add to it a pint of puree 
of spinach with some parsley, so that the soup have a deep- 
green colour. 

Gravy-Broth of Fowls. 

The flesh of foiols yields an extract which in gustatory 
fijiesse is superior even to that of mutton ; by roasting its 
flavour is naturally enhanced, and the extract becomes 
gravy-broth. Eoast the required number of fowls before 
a brisk fire, until they are half done ; then put them 

'•- It should therefore be written hotcJqJot; when ending with pofch, this 
is derived from the English to potch, to boil tender ; of this the French 
equivalent is pocher, now restricted to signifying the parboiling of eggs, 
to poach. 



APPLICATION OF BROTHS FOR SOUPS 147 

into a stock-pot, fill up with water or broth, and heat to 
boiling ; skim, add carrot, turnip, onion, celery, cloves, 
mace, and salt. Boil the mixture for two hours, and then 
strain it off for use. When colourless broth of fowls is 
required, as for Beauvilliers' i^otage a la Beine,'^ the roasting 
has to be omitted or to be done eu j^apiUote. 

White Broth of Fowls, Chicken-Broth. 

Take two or more old hens or fowls, or their carcases, 
after the fillets are abstracted for other purposes ; skin 
them, cut them in pieces, and put them in a stock-pot, 
either with water, and 1 oz. of four-seeds (equal parts of 
aniseed, caraway, cumin, and fennel) in a bag, or standard 
beef-broth ; if you omit the four-seeds put in celery, onions, 
turnips, carrots, and leeks : boil for two hours ; if you have 
old hens to deal with, boil them for three hours. Skim, pass 
through a napkin, and use. This broth, erroneously called 
consomme by some writers, properly called bouillon by Beau- 
villiers, is very useful for imparting a delicate flavour to clear 
soups. When purity of chicken flavour is not required, the 
fowls or their carcases maybe boiled in standard broth instead 
of water. This leaves any meat of the fowls fit for further use. 

Some Conclusions from the Foregoing Recipes. 

It will thus be seen that the principles for the production 
of broth (bouillon), gravy-broth (consomme), or gravy (jus), 
are the same for beef, mutton, veal, or fowl. They are con- 
sequently the same for all other kinds of meat, including 
venison and game. Hares, rabbits, pheasants, partridges, 
larks, quails, woodcocks, snipes, all may be treated accord- 
ing to the principles indicated, and furnish an extract of 
high gustatory value. But in the case of the smaller 
animals, from the fowl downwards, it must never be for- 
gotten that it is their meat alone which furnishes anything 
savoury, and that the mere extraction of carcases after 

* Loc. cit., i., p. 28. 



I4S THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

removal of all or most of the meat useful for cooking can 
furnish but little useful broth. Further, all such kinds of 
true broth are very expensive, seeing that the edible part of 
a fowl or chicken costs on an average 2s, to 2s. 6d. the 
pound, all bones and offal deducted. And as all cooks are 
constantly constrained by the remonstrances of their masters 
against high expenditure to produce tasty things at the 
least cost, the expensive and refined broths do not often 
have an opportunity to come up to our standard. Seeing 
how good and cheap are the extracts of the flesh of kine 
and sheep, the absence of rarer fumets is no great depriva- 
tion to society at large, and the most savoury dishes remain 
open to the likings of the proprietors of the most economical 
kitchens at a reasonable expenditure of money and skill. 

Application of Broths for the Production of Soup. 

From broths, as described in the foregoing, to soiqjs, is so 
small a step in transition, consisting mainly in dilution, 
that in culinary works many recipes for mere broth are 
headed as recipes for clear soup. To recite any of them 
would be a useless repetition, as they contain unaltered all 
the virtues and faults, particularly as to bones, which have 
been fully discussed above. 

As regards soups, we shall ofler a classification upon the 
basis of their characteristic ingredients, and shall take care 
to carry through a practical nomenclature. For in this 
chapter of soups the abuse or misuse of names is even 
greater than that which prevails in respect of other culinary 
productions. Not only are well - established names of 
original soups taken away from them, but they are applied 
to others, sometimes several in succession, which have no 
character in common with that which originally received 
the name. This is well proved, e.g., by the case of Brunoise 
soup. True soup of that name requires as an essential 
ingredient -pim'e of lentils, and we should therefore have to 



ADDITION OF BREAD TO SOUPS 149 



treat it under a chapter on soups made with leguminous 
seeds. But most Enghsh cookery-books omit the lentils 
entirely, and give recipes which do not materially differ 
from those of julienne or jardiniere. One even adds Italian 
paste, ■'^ which is quite inappropriate ; another omits this 
paste also, and has no attempt at specificity of any kind. 
In correction of this abuse of otherwise well-grounded 
names, all soups should be referred, if possible, to their 
original culinary names, and Bruiwisc, in particular, should 
be removed from the section oi jardiniere and similar soups, 
and classed with soups made with leguminous seeds. 

Some authors exhibit a tendency towards the excessive 
use in soups of cream, wine, and lemon-juice ; these addi- 
tions are not rarely made to hide or counteract inferior 
quality as regards savour, particularly in preparations from 
which meat is excluded ; we advise that all such additions 
should be used with discretion, and always sparingly; wine 
is an enemy to clear soup ; sherry, in particular, makes it 
bitter and compromises its savour. 

The Addition of Bread in Various Forms to Soup. 

The addition to clear soup or broth of bread, in the form 
of broken or cut pieces, of toast cut in dice, ov fried bread in 
similar shape (croiUons), yields a soup which the i^-ench term 
soujje au pain. This is a convenient soup, because it may 
be quickly prepared ; supposing you have a good broth ready, 
and have removed from it the vegetables and fat, or you 
have made a standard broth according to our recipe, it is 
only necessary to pour the hot liquid over the prepared 
bread in the soup-tureen. To a litre of broth, sufficient for 
four persons, should be added 60 grm. of bread in any form,t 
therefore 15 grm. (2 oz.) for each person; convenient forms 

* Cf. Gouffe, loc. cit., p. 370. 

t The long loaf of bread which is used by French cooks for this purpose 
is by them termed a ' flute '—flute a potar/e. On this, as on clear soup with 
bread, cf. Gouffe, loc. cit., p. 50. 



I50 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



are slices, dice, or chips ; dice and chips may be fried just 
before immersion. When the broth has been poured over 
the bread, the tureen should be covered and allowed to 
stand a little for the bread to soak ; it should not be stirred; 
the broth, therefore, must be salted, coloured, and spiced 
before being poured over. If the vegetables, which may- 
have been boiled in the broth, be presentable, serve them on 
a separate plate, but if they be fibrous and unsightly do not 
send them to table. An excellent addition to such soup is 
cjratcd Parma cheese ; it should not be added to the soup in 
the tureen, but to each plate separately, to prevent its fusion 
and adhesiveness. 

This soup must be carefully distinguished from that kind 
of hrcad-soup which in French is termed soupe mitonnde* 
This latter is prepared by adding 60 grm. of broken dry 
breadcrumb to 12 decilitres (li litre) of prepared broth 
and simmering, while constantly stirring, for twenty minutes. 
When the bread is completely disintegrated, and forms a 
fine paste, the soup is thick, like a puree, and ready for use. 
This soup is most excellent and nutritious when made with 
mcat-hreacl. 

Synoptical Classification of Soups. 

With the object of obtaining a means of survey and refer- 
ence for the practical purposes of common life and its 
relations to the kitchen, we have arranged soups into ten 
divisions or categories. By a more stringent application of 
the principles of classification, a greater number of classes 
might be obtained, but the increase would probably not 
make the arrangement of greater practical use. Several of 
the soups used as illustrations in the first division might be 
distributed amongst the nine following divisions ; but we 

* Cf. Gouffe, lor. cit., p. 53. See, however, Beauvilliers, i. 16, where 
milonncKje means the putting of previously slightly rasped and separated 
crusts in broth or Charlottes. 



CLASSIFICA riON OF SO UPS 1 5 1 



have waived these considerations also for the purpose of 
giving to this arrangement the utmost practical utility. 

First division : Soups consisting of broth, gravy, or con- 
somme only, being clear soups properly so called. The 
dietetic broths of the fifth division might be ranged here as 
a subdivision. 

Second division : Soups characterized by particular vege- 
tables ; a few compound recipes are included, but always 
exhibit a prevalence of one ingredient or another. 

Third division : Soups containing cereals or their products 
-^rice, barley, rye, wheat, Italian paste, bread, potatoes, 
cassava, tapioca. Under this division the soupes au jjciin 
described above in connection with the pot-au-feu should 
strictly be ranged, but in practical life they occupy a more 
general position. 

Fourth division : Soups made with leguminous seeds — 
peas, beans, lentils, soy. An appendix would contain 
recipes for soups of chestnuts. 

Fifth division : Soups with preparations of eggs, dietetic 
broths, and panadas (being more solid than soupes au pain). 
These might be somewhat differently distributed, e.g., the 
dietetic broths might go to the first division, and the panadas 
to the third ; but they may be left united as serving a 
common purpose, and by their blandness and digestibility 
associating kindly with soups containing preparations of 
eggs. 

Sixth division: Soups characterized by molluscs (shell- 
fish), articulates, fishes, and reptiles. It includes some of 
the most celebrated recipes, such as that for bisque and 
turtle, and the fish soups of importance to certain religious 
denominations. 

Seventh division: Soups made with flesh purees and 
minces of fowl, game, rabbit, hare, etc. In this division 
are included some characteristic soups such as cock-a-leeky 
and mulHgatunny. 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Eighth division : Soups representing expanded ragouts or 
immersed (ensouped) entrees. Of this the bouillabaisse and 
ravioli soups are representative specimens. 

Ninth division: Soups made for the utilization of giblets, 
half-denuded skeletons (carcases), heads and tails. Of this 
division oxtail soup is the most prominent type. 

Tenth division: National soups and compound dishes. 
Of this division olla, puchero, and pilau are illustrations.

Julienne Soup : its Definition, History, and Modifications. 

PoTAGE a la julienne is a standard soup, and apparently- 
very ancient. According to the recipes of Heliot,* a royal 
French cook, who lived about the middle of the eighteenth 
century, julienne soup was produced originally with the aid 
of the i^ot-au-feu, containing a shoulder of mutton half 
roasted, some slices of beef and veal, a capon and four 
pigeons ; these were stewed during from five to six hours. 
There were also added six turnips, parsley and celery roots 
(parsliac and celeriac), leeks and onions, asparagus and 
sorrel. As the meat did not remain in the soup, it is not 
essential to it, but the recipe was sure to furnish a good 
broth. The oldest recipes resemble those for the Spanish olla. 
The vegetables remain in the julienne. Mitonnage, i.e., the 

* Heliot, the earliest authority on julienne, is named Marc by Dumas, 
but J. by Careme ; he was Eaiyer ordinaire de la Bouche de Madame 
Dauphine de France about 1747. D.D., 651 ; Careme, Malt. d'Hot., i. 



JULIENNE AND JARDINIERE SOUPS 153 

addition of slices of bread to, and solution in, the soup, 
recommended by some recipes, is here omitted, as deteriorat- 
ing the quality of the product. 

Recipe for Julienne as now prepared. — Take equal quanti- 
ties or numbers of each — carrots, turnips, leeks, onions, and 
heads of celery (English leaf-stalk celery, not celeriac ; in 
case celeriac be available take half a root) ; cut them into 
thin slices an inch in length ; put them into a stewpan with 
2 oz. of butter, some salt, and a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar. Braise the vegetables slowly until they begin to 
colour ; then pour over them from three pints to three quarts, 
according to the quantity of vegetables taken, of standard 
broth, or blond de veau, or mutton-broth, or good mixed 
stock ; let the soup boil, skim off the fat, add the white 
leaves of two cabbage lettuces, some sorrel, tarragon, and 
chervil, and boil the w^hole for ten minutes more. You may 
avoid the frying and subsequent removal of the fat, although 
at the cost of some gravy flavour, by boiling the vegetables, 
including some white or savoy cabbage, or Brussels-sprouts, 
directly with the desirable quantity of standard broth for 
one hour, or until they be perfectly tender. Some cooks 
(e.g., Beauv., i. 20) add an elaborate treatment of the 
sorrel by parboiling and braising it. 

Julienne It la Langiiedocienne, or Lawjuedoc soup, is a 
julienne soup the vegetables for which are braised icith oil 
instead of butter. 

Julienne a la Nivernaise is characterized by a limitation of 
vegetables, carrots prevailing.* A Nivernaise in French 
culinary art is a ragout-like dressed dish of carrots, mostly 
formed after the shape of olives, used as a garnish ; the 
consomme in which they are stewed is condensed to adhesion 
(glace). Of this ragout the soup is a mere derivation by 
dilution. Turnips have been added to the soup, but they 

* Voce Nivernaise Soup : Garottes en Olives, dites Nivernaiaes, Gouffe,

turnips only, Beauvilliers knows it not. 



154 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



do not form part of the French dish. One recipe goes so 
far as to omit all carrots, and substitute turnips only. We 
should prepare this form of julienne by merely boiling the 
vegetables, carrots prevailing, turnips omitted, if necessary 
without previous frying, in clear standard broth. 

Jardiniere or Printani^re Soup and its Modifications. 

Definition. — This soup should contain a collection of as 
many roots and green vegetables as can be made, all boiled 
in broth ; it differs from julienne by the prevalence of green 
vegetables. The jardiniere is also called lyrintanitre, or 
spring soup, an attractive name which is less appropriate, as 
the vegetables are mostly aestival, some autumnal. 

Becipe. — Cut a number of turnips and carrots into con- 
venient fancy shapes with a so-called vegetable-scoop, or 
merely slice them conveniently ; add two heads of celery, 
two dozen small onions, called spring onions, and a cauli- 
flower broken into its smallest branches ; parboil these in 
water for three minutes, strain them on a sieve, and place 
them in the appropriate volume of standard broth (or of 
consomme of fowl, etc.); boil the whole for half an hour, 
then add the sliced white leaves of two cabbage-lettuces, 
some tarragon and chervil, sugar, pepper and salt, and boil 
until all be done. Put into the soup-tureen half a pint of 
young green peas, asparagus-heads boiled green, and a 
handful of croutons, either plain or fried in butter. The 
peas may also be added as puree. 

Jardiniere tvith spinach, or a la vertprS, is prepared like 
the foregoing ; but instead of the peas or their puree, add a 
sufficient amount of puree of spinach to thicken and colour 
the soup of a deep green. 

Observations on Clear Soup, and the Gradual Deterioration 
of Soups during the Present Century. 
When pure extract of meat is dissolved in hot water, and 
salt and tinctures of spices are added, a clear soup is

obtained. But it is never colourless. Any broth of quality 
has always some yellowish colour ; to be colourless to the 
eye it must be exceedingly dilute. A gravy-broth or con- 
somme is necessarily brown ; hence when in modern hotels, 
etc., you receive a colourless liquid under the name of con- 
somme, you see at once that the name is either the product 
of a misapprehension from ignorance, or an imposture ; a 
consomme once made cannot be deprived of its colour by 
any means. The broth from young animals, e.g., veal, is 
generally turbid, and the amateurs of clear soup will have 
such broth clarified. This is done by causing albumin, or 
white of egg, to curdle in the broth, made more acid by 
lemon-juice, a process which, when applied to wine without 
heatiog, is called fining. This clarifying, however, removes 
a good deal of the flavour of the soup, and thus sacrifices 
to the eye what it deprives the palate of. The clearer 
the soup, the more strength and colour does it require ; 
it should have no mechanical additions suspended in it. 
But in modern hotels and restaurants, clubs, etc., clear soups 
are the very reverse of all this — colourless, like water ; 
tasteless, or with a minimum of recollection of savour, such 
as mere water would acquire by standing on the hearth in 
the atmosphere of the kitchen ; and suspended in them is a 
finely-comminuted mixture of shredded vegetables, a kind 
of dwarf macedoine with no taste at all. The thick soups, 
on the other hand, while somewhat more tasty, yet are, 
even when containing any puree of quality, e.g., tomatoes or 
chestnuts, mostly set up with thickenings of flour, and not 
even a white roux, and in this exhibit a retrograde tendency 
towards the ancient gruel. This deterioration of soup, 
which is now widespread, many members of society having 
only known these shadows, has been going on for now at 
least seventy years, it having been animadverted on in the 
' Almanach des Gourmands ' in 1826, and controverted by 
Careme in the decade following that year. It was explained 



156 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

that cooks preferred to spend the available broth upon the 
entrees and sauces, and had none left for the soup. If so, 
we would beg them to omit soup from the menu, for as at 
present offered these ghosts of soups of the past produce an 
impression which it requires a host of good entrees and 
entremets to obliterate. 



CHAPTER IX. 

SOUPS CHARACTERIZED BY PARTICULAR 
VEGETABLES. 

The knowledge of the theory of broths and of the practice 
of their production would enable any practical person to 
construct any soups belonging to the ten divisions. But, 
unfortunately, the practice of cookery does not repose upon 
recognised principles, but on recipes, many of which are 
based upon flagrant error, such as that which we have 
exposed concerning bones. There is no soup worthy of the 
name which does not contain an element of imat savour. 
Whenever that is absent, a substitute is adopted in the 
shape of a strong vegetable flavour. Some of this flavouring 
is also adopted to support the savour of broth, and when 
used with moderation blends admirably with it, and is free 
from ungesthetic consequences ; we mean Uch more particu- 
larly, and a portion of onion subsidiarily, at times when leek 
is out of season. But when meat savour is impossible, or 
is intentionally withheld, the craving for taste has to be 
satisfied by strong vegetable flavour, and the acceptable 
substance selected to that end is the onion. Hence those 
strongly-flavoured meals which surround men with a 
tainted atmosphere, and cause them to be avoided by 
sensitive persons. We have known a whole suite of most 



ONION SOUPS 157 



aesthetically pure rooms, the drawing-room being scented by 
a bed of natural flowers, literally penetrated for a whole 
evening with the cepacious exhalations of a single guest 
who had made his mid-day meal on a collation of un- 
mitigated coarseness. Such feeding is only fit for persons 
who remain in quarantine or the open air, and its results 
should not be inflicted upon sesthetical noses. No person 
of taste puts onions in substance into his omelette, but 
merely allows the fat to be scented by the immersion for a 
short time of a portion of the bulb in its fusion ; every good 
cook knows how to remove the coarse effect from onions by 
edulcoration with water, or boiling in water, or baking, and 
these precautions ought to become a magiric law, an un- 
avoidable prescription of good taste, a canon to be taught 
in every lesson of elementary cooker}'. The soups and 
vegetable dishes consisting mainly of onions should be 
mitigated so as to be adapted to polite intercourse, and fall 
into the rank of civilized cookery, be it au gras or mo 
maigre, for days of rejoicing or of abstinence. 

In accordance with these principles, we will now consider 
the principal varieties of soups of which onions form the 
characteristic ingredient. 

General Observations on Onion Soups. 

Onion soups are of various kinds, and differ either by the 
kind of onion employed in their preparation, such as the 
large mild Spanish, the medium-sized ordinary French or 
English, or the little ivhite, or by the manner in which the 
onions are treated, involving frying in fat without the pro- 
duction of colour, while the specific oil is dissipated ; or 
frying to brown colour, whereby a new flavour is created ; 
parboiling or boiling in broth or water ; or by the presence or 
absence of broths and meat-extracts, so as to be au gras 
or au maigre ; and by various subordinate features, such as 
the presence of milk or cream, and of fried or gratinated 



158 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



breadcrusts. In France onion soups, and, as a sequence, 
sauces and ragouts, not rarely pass by the name of a la 
Soubise, and of this manner a white and a brown variety 
are generally distinguished. On account of the strong and 
aromatic taste of fried onion, it is a favourite material with 
which to prepare soups for fast-days, so-called i:)ota(jes 
maigres, and this accounts for the existence of a great 
number of recipes in literature. The following are typical 
examples : 

WJiite Onion Soiqj an Gras. — This soup is made with 
Spanish onions gently fried in butter, first by themselves, 
then with flour, so as to form a roux, or thickening 
material ; the body of the liquid should be standard broth. 
Bread in any of the various forms above described may 
be added to it in the tureen ; some grated cheese, Gruyere 
or Parmesan, may be handed round with it ; the cheese 
imparts a savour when broth is absent. 

White Onion Soup au Maicjre. — With this no broth, but 
only decoction of haricot beans or water, may be employed. 
Some pass the onions and bread through a tammy, and 
thus produce a puree. 

Onion Soup a la Stanislas ivith Crusts. — This soup 
is named after the quondam King of Poland, who ate of 
it in an inn at Chalons, and preserved the recipe. Much 
of the success of this form depends upon the prepara- 
tion of the crusts of bread. Break the upper crust of a 
loaf of bread in pieces, make them hot in the oveu, rub 
them over with butter, grill them gently in the oven, or 
before the fire, or in the sauta-pan, and put them into a 
plate. Then produce the onion soup, allowing 10 grm. 
of raw onion for each person who has to partake of the 
soup ; the onions are to be fried. The soup may be made 
with or without broth, and be served as it comes, or after 
having passed the tammy. It is spiced with tincture of 
pepper in the tureen. 



SOUP OF JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 159 



Gom'pound Onion Soujjs. — They are many in number, 
and are produced by the addition of other vegetables, 
such as mushrooms, which supply savour, turnijjs and 
celery — compound onion soup an gras ; or an maigre, 
brown; or by substituting milh for broth, bean decoction, 
or water — onion soup ivitli milk, or onion soup ivitli 
milh and eggs, in which the eggs are used as a final 
leeson (liaison) of all the ingredients ; a soup also termed 
Homeric soup, is a near approach to the soup of the 
heroes described in the Iliad. There is the soup of 
icliite onions, for which the small white bulbs yield 
the material, to be made with croutes a pot, or gratinated 
crusts, and a little sugar. This must not be confounded 
with ■white soup of onion, for which the bulbs are par- 
boiled in water, then completely cooked in bouillon, either 
standard or fresh made ; add to the soup 2 oz. of sioeet 
almonds, which have been blanched, pounded, and diluted 
with milh ; further, the puree of four hard-boiled yolks of 
eggs, and some panade made with bouillon ; spice with 
tincture of pepper, and pour over chips of fried bread. 

Topinamhur Soup — Soup of Jerusalem Artichohes. — 
This is a soup made with the puree of the tubers of the 
topinaiyihur plant. When this vegetable was brought to 
Europe from South America, it was termed sunfloioer or 
girasol, from its similarity to the true sunflower, Helianthus 
annuus. The name girasol, which was to indicate the 
erroneous supposition that the flower was always turned to 
the sun, and gyrated with its rise and sinking, was then 
corrupted into Jerusalem. From some similarity of the 
taste of the tubers to the taste of the petals and bottoms of 
the artichokes, the topinamhur was now termed Jerusalem 
artichoke. Some people made confusion worse by calling 
a soup made with the tubers of topinamhur Palestine 
soup ; we adhere to the true native name of the plant, 
topinamhur, used by all classical magiric authors. 



i6o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



The tubers have to be peeled and sHced, and put im- 
mediately into water containing some flour in suspension 
to prevent their becoming discoloured. They are next to 
be stewed, say two dozen average tubers, in 4 oz. of 
fresh butter, and to be simmered slowly until they be done, 
without being browned in the least. Add two quarts of 
standard broth, a little sugar, celery, onion, and tincture 
of pepper, and boil until all be tender, then pass through 
a tammy, and boil up the puree. 

Compotmd Spmach Souj). — This soup contains besides the 
principal herb dry peas, green peas, and French beans, all 
as purees, and fried bread. 

Souj) of PurSe of Spinach. — The spinach has to be par- 
boiled, pressed and comminuted ; it has to be stewed with 
butter, tincture of nutmeg, and salt. The addition of 
broth is preceded by that of some veloute sauce. Point 
with butter, sugar, and some glace. This soup is also 
called It la Beauvanx, 

Tomato Soup. — This soup, a favourite of the Americans, so 
that some call it a I'Americaine, is really expanded tomato- 
sauce. The love-apples have to be stewed in a mirepoix- 
roux of butter, flour, bacon, carrot, onion, tincture of 
pepper and cayenne, all fried together. The standard 
broth is then added. Two pounds of tomatoes in slices and 
two quarts of standard broth will make good soup for 
four, more diluted for eight, persons. The tomatoes have 
to pass the sieve, to retain peels and seeds, and become 
puree. 

Soups of Purees of Carrots, Turnips, and other Vegetables, 
called Soups a la Crecy. 

General Note. — There are a great many recipes for soups 
called a la Cr4cy in culinary literature, which have only 
this feature in common, namely, that they contain puree of 



SOUPS OF PUREES OF ROOTS, ETC. i6i 

carrots. The original Crecy,* however, contained many 
vegetables ; indeed, for it were prescribed, as for jardiniere, 
toutes sortes de Ugumes.j which were to be parboiled, fried 
in butter, pounded, passed through a sieve, and thus trans- 
formed into a puree, to be mixed with prepared broth. 
Compared v^ith this most comprehensive recipe all other 
recipes become more or less specializations in favour of 
carrots, until some hold puree of carrots only and soupe 
a la Crecy to be synonymous. Eecipes which look much 
to the colour of the puree prescribe that the red or outer 
part only of the carrots should be taken, and the core be 
rejected. This selection is needless when other roots, such 
as turnips, are added. We should call the original Crecy 
soup, as the most complicated, comi^ound carrot soup ; every 
plain one, cannot soup simply. For the production of puree, 
the carrots should be parboiled in water for ten minutes, 
and then stewed with fresh butter, sugar, salt and aromatic 
herbs, and ultimately boiled with standard broth. 

The soup of puree of carrots may receive an addition of 
(jreen peas or of rice. 

The soups of puree of tiirnips are two in number, one 
called ivhite, the other hroicn ; for the production of the 
latter, the turnips are browned during the braising, by 
frying and formation of glace ; in the case of the white 
soup they are kept covered with broth during the whole 
process of boiling. Turnips should always be parboiled in 
water, and the water should be poured away, as in their 
natural state they would yield too strong a flavour, and be 
difficult to digest. 

A soup of puree of turnips and tomatoes, made after the 
brown modification, and served with quenelles of potatoes, 
has been called soupe a la Piemontaise, and been supposed 
to be a national soup ; but it is little specific. 

* Also spelt Croissy : F., 292 ; Cord. Bl., 23 and others. f D.D., 862.

i62 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Lettuce and icliole i)ea soup and Flemish soup are mere 
modifications of the julienne and jardiniere class ; the 
Flemish has also been termed poly-oleric, or many-fold 
vegetable soup. Besides carrots, turnips, celery, and 
leek, boiling in standard broth, there are sliced cucumbers 
added, and further, a secondary selection of oleraceous 
vegetables, namely, Brussels-sprouts (which justifies our 
adjective Flemish), young green peas, a few French beans 
cut small, and some asparagus-heads; when these are 
parboiled, they are added to the main soup. 

A mere modification of Flemish soup is cabbage or kale 
soup, in which summer cabbages are substituted for the 
autumnal sprouts. Another modification is Dutch soup, or 
Soupe a la Hollandaise; this contains the cucumber, but 
omits the cabbage. 

Soup of puree of spring herbs, comminuted printaniere, 
is made with early green vegetables, sorrel, dandelion, and 
burrage. For the closely-related Bonne Femme soup, cabbage 
lettuces are braised with the sorrel, in butter, treated with 
bouillon, and a liaison of yolk, butter, sugar, and glace. 
Sorrel and lettuce must be present in about equal quantity ; 
we have seen a recipe in which the sorrel is diminished to 
tiDo leaves, which seems useless ; strong flavours, like chervil, 
dimin"ish the homogeneity of the soup. 

The following vegetables yield purees, which can be worked 
into soups : Asparagus, made green with some spinach, and 
mixed with asparagus -heads or points ; artichokes, endives, 
leek,* scorzonera, or salsify, \ white and black. Cucumber 
also yields a puree soup in the two usual forms ; gourd,% or 

* Leek soup also passes as soupe a la Bresanne, D.D., 863 ; no deriva- 
tion is given. 

f Scorzonera soup, D.D., 863, ex Brillat-Savarin. It is practical to put 
scorzoneras into soup when their quantity is insufficient to produce a dish 
of stewed vegetable for entremets. 

X Gourd is the true English name ; the other is the product of affecta- 
tion. The French name is courge, to which neologists have added the 
absurd a la moelle. 



SOUPS OF CEREALS 163 

vegetable marrow, o^xidi pumpkin yield purees, of which the 
latter is the preferable one both as to colour and taste ; the 
gourd requires much evaporation of its water to yield a 
tasty soup. Mushrooms — i.e., champignons — form a very 
tasty puree if they are taken young enough ; a dozen of 
them with six sliced tomatoes, two carrots, an onion, 
4 oz. of veal and 4 oz. of ham, fried in 2 oz. of butter, and 
boiled with a quart of standard broth, tincture of pepper 
and salt, and a flavouring of aromatic herbs, will yield a 
product which, when passed through the tammy, reheated 
and pointed with some lemon-juice, will be a most attractive 
soup for from six to eight persons. 



CHAPTER X. 

SOUPS CONTAINING CEREALS OR THEIR PRODUCTS, 
RICE, BARLEY, RYE, WHEAT, ITALIAN PASTE, 
BREAD, POTATOES, CASSAVA, TAPIOCA. 

Let all rice to be used in soups be parboiled with water for 
ten minutes, and after the water is drained off, add clear 
standard broth, with any roots and green condiments you 
choose. Half a pound of Carolina rice will be a proper pro- 
portion for two quarts of standard broth. The vegetables 
being removed, add grated Parma cheese when the soup is 
on the plate. The following combinations of rice soup are 
in most favour : 

Clear Soup with Bice and Asparagus-points. 

Bice -Soup with Minced Chicken. — Cf. chijfonade, or 
chicken puree soup, infra. 

Compound Veal and Bice Soup. — In this knuckle of veal, 
calf's foot, and a roast partridge are employed. All 



i64 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

gelatinous and meaty parts are cut up small and put into 
the soup. 

Flain Savoury Puree of Bice Sotqo. — This may be made 
with beef broth, or white with chicken - broth and veal. 
It requires a pound of rice to two quarts of broth. 

Savoury Puree of Bice Soup with Whole Bice.'*' 

Puree of Bice Soup with Crayfish and Quenelles of Fowl. — 
Two quarts require about thirty tails of crayfish, and three 
dozen small quenelles of fowl. Point with crayfish- or 
lobster-butter and lemon. In case the tails and quenelles 
be coloured with cochineal or alkauBt-root, the dish will 
obtain some external claim to the name of a la cardinal, 
with which it is marked in some recipes. 

Puree of Bice Soup ivith Parma Cheese and Quenelles of 
Fowl. — This soup requires the addition of a leeson (liaison, 
binding) of six yolks of eggs to prevent the 2 oz. of 
Parmesan cheese from coalescing and becoming a viscid 
sediment. The small quenelles of fowls may be coloured 
with spinach-green. 

Pur4e of Bice Soup with Custard of Pur4e of Chicken. — 
The custards are made with the pounded white meat, 
or all the meat of a roast chicken, passed through a 
tammy, with the aid of some white sauce ; the pur6e is 
bound by eight yolks, with nutmeg, salt, and consomme of 
fowls ; the custard paste is placed in a dozen dariole 
moulds, and these are steamed, immersed half-way in 
water, in a fricandeau-pan. 

PiirSe of Bice Soup loith Purde of Pheasant or Partridge. 

Puree of Bice Soup loith Croquettes of Bice. — The croquettes 
are made savoury with Parma cheese. This last puree has 
been classified as one of the * national soups ' under the 
name a la Florenti^ie ; but it probably has, as the name 
indicates, only a local, and no national reputation. 

* Thid is called a cream by some [e.g., F., 317 tt seq.), a misnomer 
which we eliniiuate. 



BARLEY SOUPS 165 



Soups made with Barley. 

General Observations on Culinary Barley. — In the pre- 
paration for soups, barley has to be blanched — i.e., par- 
boiled and washed in the same manner as rice ; it has then 
to be boiled with well-prepared and flavoured broth, until 
it be quite done. Barley soups always are somewhat 
opaque, the more the longer the boiHng has continued ; 
this is a property of the peculiar starch contained in it. 
The barley best adapted for culinary purposes is termed 
Frankfort pearl barley, and this should be employed in the 
execution of all the recipes alluded to in the following. 
The puree of barley forms by simmering a semi-solution, 
which is very smooth and coherent, hence in Germany 
is called a mucilage. Some authors call this mucilage a 
cream. Barley contains about 13"78 per cent, of water, 
11-16 per cent, of nitrogenous matter, and 62*25 per cent. 
of a starch peculiar to it. Barley soups neither require 
nor bear liaisons of eggs, or additions of Parma cheese. 
Having the peculiar mucilaginous body and fine flavour, 
which amalgamates best with the savour of various de- 
scriptions of meat, they should be treated very sparingly 
with spices and aromatic herbs ; the addition to . them 
of wine should be in general avoided ; cream also should 
be added sparingly, if at all. With these limitations 
barley soups are most desirable articles of the dietary of 
the healthy as well as the sick. We shall omit from the 
following list of soups the fanciful, and, as no motives have 
been stated, perfectly gratuitous and unmeaning titles 
which they have received at various hands. These appella- 
tions are the less valuable and the more confusing, as 
various authors apply widely different names to the same 
dishes. These names have, therefore, not even the char- 
acter of symbols by which their bearers could be recognised 
i and described. 



i66 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Plain Barley Souj). — Blanch \ lb. of barley and boil it 
in two quarts of standard broth, flavoured with roots and 
aromatic herbs. Observe that the proportions are the 
same as in plain rice soup. 

Barley Soup with Minced Chicken. 

Coinjjound Veal and Barley Soup. — The preparation of 
this soup is the same as that of the rice soup above alluded 
to. Observe that in neither of these two soups is the skin 
of the calf's foot, the mock turtle, used in the soup, but 
only the tendons and gristle, which "seems a small result 
for so laborious a process. The gelatinogenous material 
might be obtained easily from cow's heel prepared at the 
tripe-shop. 

Plain Puree or Mucilage of Barley Soup. — Observe the 
test for the completed coction of the barley, proving that it 
is * done,' that a corn is easily bruised or compressed to a 
thin plate between two fingers. The same test obtains for 
rice. 

Savoury Piirie or Mucilage of Barley with Whole Barley. 
— For this more concentrated preparation 1 lb. of pearl- 
barley is boiled with two quarts of any broth ; one third of 
the barley is kept whole, the other two-thirds are worked 
into pur^e through a tammy, and, when transformed into 
mucilage, reunited with the whole barley reserved. 

Pur&e of Barley with Puree of Pheasant or Partridge.

Soups made with Italian Paste, Macaroni. Vermicelli, 
Lasagnes, Semolina, etc. 

Note on Macaro7ii. — This remarkable preparation of flour, 
apparently original to South Italy, bears an italicized Greek 
name, implying happiness, and is perhaps to be considered 
as an invention of the early Greek settlers, who made 



ITALIAN PASTE SOUPS 167 

Sicily and Calabria flourish. Macaroni were brought to 
France from Italy by some Florentines, probably at the 
time of the marriage of Catherine of Medicis with Henry II. 
Their home is Naples, where they are prepared in many 
different ways — boiled, in soups, au gratin, etc., always 
accompanied with grated Parmesan cheese ; like potatoes 
or bread, they are on every table, from that of the richest 
citizen to that of the most humble inhabitant. 

Macaroni are made from wheat-grits or flour, of which 
qualities are selected which contain much gluten ; the parts 
of such grits, of which thirty-four parts require ten to twelve 
parts of boiling water, are worked vehemently under heavy 
revolving stones, and upon this working depends much of 
their quality as regards taste and permanency of shape. 
The best macaroni are made in Italy, at Naples, Livorno, 
Genoa, and Turin, and in the Auvergne in France. In the 
latter country some sorts of macaroni are also made from 
wheat gluten^ obtained in the manufacture of starch ; of this 
gluten ten parts, flour which need not be rich in gluten 
thirty parts, and five to six parts of boiling water, are mixed. 
Macaroni and other sorts of Italian paste contain in the 
mean 13 per cent, of water, 9 per cent, of nitrogenous 
matter, 0-25 per cent, of fat, nearly 77 per cent, of starch 
and matters free from nitrogen, and 0-8 per cent, of ash. 

From physiological experiments on digestion, it follows 
that although macaroni are as well digested as bread, yet 
they are, like bread, not sufficiently rich in nitrogenized 
substance to serve as a perfect food ; during their exclusive 
use a vigorous, previously well-fed man will lose daily from 
6 to 7 grammes of nitrogen furnished by his own tissues. 
In this respect the French macaroni, to which gluten is 
added, are a little better, for they offer to the body a 
greater proportion of nitrogenous matter. The addition of 
cheese and eggs and of meat fills up the deficiency in 
ordinary diet. 



i68 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Clear Soup ivith Macaroni, Plain Macaroni Soup. — Boil 
1 lb. of pipe-macaroni, previously soaked in cold water, in 
a sufficiency of water to which some salt has been added. 
When they are nearly cooked, which will take about half 
an hour's boiling in case they were not soaked, and less if 
they were swelled in cold water, drain them upon a napkin, 
and cut them in pieces of about an inch in length. Put them 
into a soup-pot, add two quarts of standard broth moderately 
flavoured with roots and herbs, or bits of fowl or game, 
and let it boil ten minutes longer. Send Parma cheese on 
a plate for each diner to help himself. 

Clear or Plain Vermicelli Soup. — Vermicelli, being made 
of the same paste as macaroni, but of very much thinner 
shape, are cooked much more quickly than the latter. Take 
half a pound of vermicelU, break them short, and keep them 
for three minutes in boihng water to remove any extraneous 
flavour which they may have acquired ; drain them in a 
sieve, and put them in a stewpan with two quarts of any 
finished broth ; boil until the vermicelli are done, which 
will take less than half an hour. Send to table with Par- 
mesan, or a mixture of Parma and Gruyere, cheese. As 
vermicelli are quickly cooked, they are useful for producing 
soup in a short time. They are more voluminous than 
macaroni, and hence half a pound only must be used with 
two quarts of standard broth, while of macaroni a whole 
pound can be put into the same quantity. When it is 
intended to produce a less nutritious and more liquid soup, 
60 grammes of any kind of paste to the litre of finished 
broth is a good proportion. 

Plain Soup of Italian Paste, or Star Nouilles. — The stars 
or paste of any shape require previous ablution with boiling 
water, like the vermicelli, but a little longer boiling in broth. 

Plaiii Soup of Lasagnes. — These ribbon-like forms of 
macaroni paste have to be treated in all respects like 
macaroni. 



I 



SEMOLINA, NOUILLES, OR NUDELN 169 

Compo2md Macaroni Soup. — This is a savoury macaroni 
soup, with the addition of a liaison of egg-yolks. Ten 
ounces of pipe-macaroni to two quarts of standard broth are 
adequate. 

Compound Macaroni Soup with Cheese and Tomatoes. — 
The tomatoes are added as a puree to the soup. 

Compound Macaroni Soup with Crayfish and Quenelles of 
Foiol. 

Compound Macaroni Soup with Soft Roes of Mackerel and 
Flakes of Salmon. 

Note on Semolina, French Nouilles, German Nudeln. — 
Semolina, in French more strictly semoule, is a paste made 
of wheat-flour or grits, similar to macaroni, but containing 
yolk of eggs, which is not present in macaroni. This paste, 
as used in France, is called nouilles paste; in Germany, 
Nudeln-Teig. It is perhaps most used in the latter country, 
and is of better taste than macaroni ; but as the latter are 
sold ready-made, and the nouilles have to be made in the 
kitchen, the former have much displaced their superior 
rivals. 

Mode of making Semolina, or Nouilles, or Nudeln. — We 
give a description of this important process here, as it is not 
often described in English culinary works. Place J lb. 
of finest wheat-flour on the pastry-board or the marble slab, 
make a hollow crater in the centre, and place in it four 
yolks of eggs, a little cream or warmed butter, some tincture 
of nutmeg and pepper, and some salt ; work this mixture 
until all the flour is incorporated so as to form a very stiff 
dough. Eoll out and double it repeatedly, and ultimately 
roll it out to very thin sheets of dough, and hang them up 
to dry. Then roll them up, and cut them with a knife into 
strips of such width, varying between one-eighth of and half 
an inch, as the exigencies require. Loosen and strew these 
ribbons over a baking-sheet covered with paper, and dry 
them for several hours before the fire or in the warm closet. 



lyo THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

In the form of ribbons this paste remains nouilles or nudeln ; 
but, broken up into small fragments, like grits, it is called 
semolina — French semoule. 

Plain or Clear Semolina Soup. — The semolina soups, or 
German Nudeln soups, are closely analogous to the soups of 
Italian paste above alluded to. 

Semolina Soup with Fillets of Larks or Beccaficas. — The 
fillets are to be taken from birds braised with fine herbs. 

Semolina Soup with Calf's Feet and Quenelles. — In this 
recipe the mock turtle of the calf's feet remains in the 
soup, and takes the place of the fillets in the previous 
recipe."^ 

Gratinated Crust Soups— Potages Croute au Pot. 

A good English equivalent for the name would be soups 
with gravy -broiuned crusts. Broth is transformed into gravy 
by being condensed, dried, and caramelized by heat while 
fixed on the breadcrusts, which here act as spongy 
mechanical media ; later on, after solution and softening, as 
distributors of the tasty gravy, and as nutriment. Some of 
these soups are very substantial. The crusts are obtained 
by excavating small rolls, specially baked for the dish, to 
obtain much crusty surface, yet the glassy surface of the 
crust has to be cautiously rasped off. When no special rolls 
are at hand, take slices or crusts of ordinary bread, for as 
the crusts hardly preserve their shape in the tureen, or in 
the serviug, it is not of much consequence to the aspect of 
the dish. On the other hand, the crusts of small half-rolls, 
placed side by side with the open cups upwards, are con- 
venient for being basted or moistened with the bouillon, and

serve as dishes for evaporation, while sucking in the con- 
centrated products of the process from the dish, which are 
then immediately caramelized or browned. Such gratinated 
crusts on a silver dish also look very pretty, i.e., culinarily 
attractive, as indicating fine taste, and are convenient to 
serve. If rolls be baked expressly, let them be made of the 
size and shape of hens' eggs ; a dozen will be sufficient for a 
table with sixteen covers. The broth to be put over them 
must be thick, fat consomme. The last browning must be 
effected in the oven if the main process was carried out on a 
silver dish over charcoal or gas. 

The 8011J) is put over the crusts only at the moment of 
serving, so that it has not time to entirely undo the crispness 
of the crusts. The soup may be any clear gravy or com- 
pound savoury soup, from jardiniere to onion soup. Seeing 
that the more simple soups are preferred, we agree with the 
French cooks, who immerse the gratinated crusts in a rich 
bouillon only. 

Of practical recipes we record the following •*

Soup with Gratinated Crusts and Fried Turnips. — To this 
soup some young gi-eeu pieas and a few white button onions^ 
all boiled tender by themselves, may be added. 

Soup ivith Gratinated Crusts and Puree of Carrots. 

Soup a la Bonne Femme with Gratinated Crusts. 

* For Potage CroiUe an Pot, cf. D.D., 481 ; id. ih., 856 ; F., loc. cit., 
279 et seq. These are excellent soups, provided the cook has mastered 
the theory and practice of gratination. Most cooks have no clear concep- 
tion of it, and some none at all. Beauvilliers' recipe [loc. cit., i. 16) is not 
quite intelligible ; it appears to me as if it contained two alternatives, 
fused into one recipe by an inattentive copyist. 



172 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Soups made with Potatoes, Cassava, Tapioca. 

General Observations. — Soup may be made from potatoes 
directly after they have been boiled or during their being 
boiled, or the potatoes may be boiled and dried, and then 
moistened again ; or they may be roasted or fried in fat, and 
then made into soup. Each of these processes imparts a 
somewhat different character to the product. In most 
cases it is advisable to transform the potatoes into a puree, 
and give to this uniformity by a binding if the potatoes used 
were rough-starched. 

Plain Potato Soup of a dozen tubers requires the ordinary 
bulbs, roots, herbs and spices, but above all, a quantity 
of not less than 4 oz. of fresh butter ; moisten the whole 
with two quarts of standard broth. Serve with chips of 
fried bread. 

Fried Potato Soup. — This soup goes under various patro- 
nymics, all of which are unsupported by history or anecdote. 
It possesses some specificity in this, that a portion of the 
potato-starch is by frying transformed into dextrin, which 
imparts to the soup a somewhat more mucilaginous body, 
reminding of barley soup. Some recipes order the addition 
of a pint of boiling cream, which is excessive and detri- 
mental to the savoury character and digestibility of the 
soup. Others advise the addition of a garnish of shredded 
lettuce, which interferes with the unity of this excellent 
soup.* 

Potato Soup with Quenelles of Potato. 

Quenelles of Potatoes to be used in the Foregoing Soup. — 
Bind the mashed and sifted potatoes (six) with butter, 
cream, and tinctures of spices ; add the yolks of three eggs 
and the whites of two eggs, whipped to a froth, also chopped 
parsley ; heat the paste, form into quenelles, and poach 
these in boiling water or broth. 

• * Potato soups, various, cf. D.D., 850 ; F., 310. 



LEGUMINOUS SEED SOUPS 173 



Tapioca Soup. — 4 oz. of tapioca to two quarts of standard 
broth, boiled until gelatinous and easily compressed or 
crushed. Bind with yolk cautiously. 

Cassava Soup. — Break the cassava bread or cake, made 
from the fleshy part of the manioc-root, in a mortar, and use 
the fragments as just prescribed for tapioca. The cassava 
is even more gelatinous than the tapioca, and, if of good 
quality, makes an excellent soup. 

Soup made with Rye — Green Corn Soup. 

This soup is peculiar by the fact that its material is mainly 
parched under-ripe green rye. This is sold in a roughly- 
pounded condition, ready for being put into the casserole. 
Boil it in standard broth for an hour, with leek, parsley, 
salt, butter, tincture of spice, and pass the product through 
a tammy ; point the mucilaginous puree with a little butter, 
and send to table with fried dice of bread, or small quenelles 
of fish, or veal, or game."^ 



CHAPTER XI. 

SOUPS MADE WITH LEGUMINOUS SEEDS— PEAS, 
BEANS, LENTILS, SOY. 

For the purpose of being eaten in soups, leguminous seeds 
are most suitably transformed into p2cr4es. These can then 
be diluted with broth or water, and adapted to the wants of 
consumers. Leguminous seeds are the mainstay of vege- 
tariaii diet so called, because they alone can, in some 
measure, supply the nitrogenous food of which meat is the 

* Rottenhofer, loc. cit., p. 50, adds eggs as a liaison, and a boiled custard 
(this latter misnamed cream). The specificity of the soup is most evident 
without any solids except fried bread. 



174 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

ideal, and of which the human body stands so much in 
need. There are several obstacles to the general and 
frequent use of leguminous seeds, particularly in soups. In 
the first place, they require long and careful preparation 
before being cooked, as well as during the cooking. Thus, 
peas and haricot beans require to be soaked in pure water — 
distilled water is the best ; pure rain-water comes next ; soft 
natural water in the third, water made soft by the addition 
of some carbonate of soda in the fourth place. Hard loater 
of every kind, i.e., water containing either carbonate or 
sulphate of lime in solution, is injurious to the seeds ; for, 
as the lime-salt combines with some of the ingredients of 
the seeds, it makes the seeds hard : they are not sufficiently 
softened by boiling, and remain indigestible to a large 
extent. Against this accident the transformation into puree 
is only a partial defence, for it is adopted probably only in 
regions in which the precaution of the necessary soaking in 
soft water would also be taken; the lower classes, who 
have most need of substantial physiological cookery and 
nutrition, do not generally understand or obey the injunc- 
tions as regards soft water, or have no means of obeying 
them. Moreover, the length of time required to cook the 
seeds is to them objectionable, and they therefore prefer 
bread, bacon, steak, and cheese to soups. Pease are eaten 
by the lower classes of towns in quantity, as pease-pudding 
so called, which they buy ready-made in the cook-shop, a 
portion, wrapped in paper, for a penny. Leguminous soups 
are distributed in soup-kitchens over which intelligent 
charity keeps control. 

The forms of soup of leguminous seeds which can be 
made, or are more commonly made, are collected in the 
following titles :

Mode of preparing Extract of Spinacli. 

Comminute in a mortar 1 lb. of spinach, and when it is 
quite a paste place it upon a strong cloth, roll it up, and 
twist the opposite ends so as to wring the cloth and spinach 
and express the juice. The twisting of the cloth can be 
made easier by using two cooking spoons as levers at the 
ends. Place the extract in a pan, heat it until the chloro- 
phyll and albumin are coagulated, drain the deposit of 
water, and work it through a tammy ; use this for the 
coloration of puree, particularly that of young green peas. 

Japanese Soy, India or China Soy. 

Soy is not a soup itself, but a preparation put into and 
eaten with soup as a flavouring ingredient. Soy is the 
Japanese name of a leguminous plant, Dolichos soja, L. 
The name is next transferred to a saucelike condiment 
made in Japan with the beans or grain ; it is said that it 
is produced by a fermentation of the bean in salt water. 
In Europe soy was formerly obtained as a brown treacle- 

* The Soup of Puree of Garbancas is sometimes called Bearnaise, and 
from this circumstance has been ranged with national clLshes. It contains 
onions, celery, carrots, garlic, tomatoes, and butter, besides the peas ; it 
is also garnished with cabbage, and Parma cheese is given with it. 

t Brunoise is a soup of Puree of Lentils exclusively, and the name 
should not be applied to other preparations. Cf. D.D., 863. 



176 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

like extract. It now is imported as a thinner sauce-like 
brown liquid. Cautiously mixed with soups, ragouts, 
sauces, or even, minces and gravies on the plate, it gives 
them a roundness of taste which to some is agreeable. 

The soja bean is used by the Japanese for the production 
of a bouilli or puree called miso ; the sauce which they call 
sooju is said* to be made with the aid of meat-juice, but 
there is no certain information. 

General Rule as regards Garnishes to Leguminous Soups. 

When vegetable garnishes or whole leguminous seeds are 
added to the finished puree, do not give any dice of fried 
bread. 

The dice of fried bread have been called Conde crusts, but 
this is misleading ; they might be called fried dice of bread- 
crumb a la Conde, but crusts they are not, even though they 
become crust-like by frying.

over them. Fried dice of bread or croutons may be added. 
The pure soup is most desirable food for persons suffering 
from an affection of the intestinal canal — e.g., typhoid or 
enteric fever. The soup may be made quickly for and by 
travellers, v^ho carry the extract of meat ready v^ith them. 

Savoiiry Custard Soicp is a clear broth soup with sliced 
savoury custard immersed in it. There are variations of 
this recipe which anyone may use as means of adaptation 
to particular circumstances. The savoury custard is a 
fully-set custard, curdled by heat, mainly the water-bath, 
in which the custard mixture is placed in a mould. 

Compound Savoury Custard Soup contains vegetables 
besides the custard. 

Compound Savoury Quenelles Soup is characterized by 
quenelles made of flour, butter, cream, cheese, and eggs, 
well flavoured and spiced. The souffle paste is divided by a 
forcer, or conical paper bag, into the small lumps which, 
when poached, forai the quenelles. 

Soups for Fast-days made with Vegetables only. 

General Observations. — The recipes for soups made with 
herbs to be used on fast-days are very numerous in 
literature ; it would be quite useless to describe any 
number of them, and no information would be conveyed 
by the names which have been attributed to them. Many 
are the product of a desire for novelty or complication. 
Thus, a recipe for such a soup, called potage aux herbes a la 
Dauphin^, enumerates spinach, lettuce, leek, onions, sorrel, 
orach (or goose-foot, two handfuls), beets, chervil, leaves of 
tansy, branches of purslane, and flowers of marigold, with- 
out the bitter ovary or calyx ; the chopped herbs are to be 
heated in butter, and infused with meagre broth — i.e., court 
bouillon, fish-broth, or decoction of haricot beans. 

Another Lent soup called a la Bonne Fenwie contains a

selection of the foregoing, and is to be made with grand 
hoidllon maigre — i.e., fish and leguminous bouillon. 

A Compound Vegetable PtirSe Soiq? in France bears the 
name of the celebrated restaurateur Vuillemot, whose 
portrait by Eajon in * The Dictionary of the Kitchen ' 
follows that of Dumas, by the same celebrated engraver. 
The quantity is for twelve persons. Take 20 grm. of 
white haricots, 20 grm. of green peas, 4 potatoes, 4 carrots, 
4 turnips, 4 white onions, 4 leeks, a bouquet of parsley and 
celery. Place all in an (earthenware) pot, fill in 3 litres 
of soft water, add salt, a pat of butter, and boil till the 
vegetables are done. Then pass the vegetables through a 
tammy, let the puree simmer to throw up the rough parts, 
which remove, then moisten with the vegetable bouillon. 
Boil 20 grm. of Carolina rice in some of the bouillon. Also 
fry some sorrel and chervil in butter, and put them into the 
soup. Make a binding of four yolks with a measure of 
cream and 100 grm. of butter, and mix the whole with the 
soup. 

Cherry Soup, or Cherry Pur^e Soup. — According to Dumas 
('Diet.' 856), cherry soup — in French ^;o^«^e aux cerises 
(\ VAllemande — and heer soup are the two popular soups 
of Germany, a bit of epigrammatic romancing of this lively 
author Beer soup in Germany is analogous to the hot 
spiced mulled ale of England. But cherry soup is confined 
to a few localities of North Germany. It is made with the 
acid cherries called after their home Vistula or Weichsel 
cherries, known in England as Kentish pie cherries. The 
cherries, stewed with cinnamon and lemon-rind, are divided 
in three parts : one is reserved to be stoned, and put whole 
into the soup ; the two other parts are first boiled with 
some water, bound with a roux of flour, and then passed 
through the tammy; add sugar to taste. Pound the 
cherry-stones, and heat them with two or three glassfuls 
of red wine just to boiling, sti^ain through a linen cloth,

and add the extract to the soup. This is a very agreeable 
and refreshing soup, resembHng an Oriental sherbet. It is 
to be accompanied with sponge-cakes. 

Both Germans and Russians have a number of heer 
soujjs ; the standard Eussian one^ is eaten cold; the 
highly-spiced beer soicp called a la Berlinoise is well mulled 
with eggs, and eaten hot. The Germans also eat a cold dish, 
in summer time, made of beer, sour milk, and cream, grated 
bread, and cinnamon with sugar ; it is not called a soup. 
Some meagre soups have been noticed above, and we shall 
meet others under the heading of Soups prepared loith Shell 
fish and Fish. 

In some popular treatises many soups in which a liaison 
of eggs is used are termed egg soups ; but this is an 
erroneous use of a collateral feature to supply a name for a 
product of no particular quality. 

Dietetic Broths and Decoctions for Patients and Invalids. 

A separate division for these preparations seems almost 
superfluous, as those which are most useful are ail de- 
scribed under the heading relating to broths of all kmds. 
But in some respects they require, and in other reapects 
admit of, a somewhat difl'erent treatment. 

The broths for invalids must frequently be kept free from 
vegetable extracts — e.g., of turnips or onions — as these are 
apt to molest deUcate or young stomachs. Then, as patients 
and invalids are often living smgly by themselves, and even 
when congregated in hospitals, etc., require refreshments 
at different times, the latter have to be prepared in small 
portions and at odd times. This necessitates as well as 
allows a more simple treatment of the materials. 

Chicken-broth — e.g., for children or women — may be made 

* Russian Gold Beer Soup. Cf. D.D., 873, ex 'La Cuisine Fran9aise,' 
to the editor of which the recipe, as in use at St. Petersburg and Moscow, 
(vas sent by the author of the * Memoires of Madame de Crequy.' 



i8o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



emollient by boiling with marsh-mallow root and barley, and 
sweetened with Narhonne honey. Boil, skim, and filter. 

Mutton-broth, if made from minced mutton, should be 
flavoured with parsley, thyme, and salt only, when other 
vegetables are counter-indicated. Beef-tea and veal-broth 
may be made into gravy-broth by frying the beef and veal ; 
then vegetables are unnecessary. An addition of some 
Parma cheese will enhance the flavour. Veal and crayfish 
broth is liked even by greatly reduced persons in chronic 
wasting diseases. The imagination assists in the produc- 
tion of a liking. Chervil is a good pot-herb for flavour. 
The carcases of the crayfish can be treated as for bisque, 
and the tails, if they be few, should be rubbed into a puree 
and added to the soup. 

Decoctions of sjiails and frogs appear to us ridiculous, 
or even repulsive. But many nations and many strata 
of the populace use, eat, drink, and like them. They 
fulfil a demand of the imagination, namely, that sundry 
sufferings, even when small and temporary, will be relieved 
by preparations which are not part of the daily dietary. In 
France the large horned garden or vineyard snails, Helix 
po7natia, are eaten by thousands as a delicate dish, just like 
stuffed fried oysters, and they are really very appetising. 
Frogs' thighs are also eaten by many, and to the historical 
dish of Madame Volta we owe the discovery of Voltaic 
electricity. They yield a bland broth, and by the addition of 
snails a mucilaginous, nearly gelatinous one, which greatly 
comforts sore mucous surfaces of mouth and throat, cover- 
ing the raiu membranes with the layer of mucin of which 
the diseased process has destituted them. For this broth 
hay-saffron is the proper spicing and colouring ingredient. 

Decoctions of Ceylon Moss and of Iceland Moss. — To a 
quart of good well-finished veal-broth add an ounce of 
Previte's or any other Ceylon moss ; boil for half an hour, 
and pass through a silk strainer, This moss contains a

hitter and a starchy matter, and yields a bland, soothing, 
somewhat tonic decoction. It resembles Iceland or reindeer 
moss in many features. Of this latter, called Cetraria 
Islandica, a decoction is medicinal,* and the following are 
the directions for its preparation. Having washed an ounce 
of dry moss in cold water, boil it with a pint of distilled 
water, and strain. It yields about 56 per cent, of its weight 
of starch, and 20 per cent, of another carbo-hydrate ; its 
nitrogenous ingredients amount to only 2-19 per cent., and 
there is a little fat. The amount of starch approaches that 
in chestnuts (60 per cent.). 

Panadas and Delicate Soups for the Nourishing of Infants, 
Patients, and Invalids. 

These preparations are useful in emergencies, and very 
serviceable in the nutrition of patients with affections of 
the throat. 

Chicken Panada. — A panada is, as the word indicates, a 
preparation of bread. It is always soaked, softened, and 
flavoured with either broth, gravy-broth, milk, or cream. 
Mince and pound, and make into puree the white flesh of a 
young roasted fowl, and add its volume of standard broth 
panada ; salt it gently, avoid all pot-herbs, roots, spices, 
etc. Offer it in a custard-cup, to be eaten with a small 
spoon. {Cf. Blanc Mangers, infra.) 

Pheasant and Partridge Panada may be prepared in the 
same manner. 

Venison Panada will please the sick sportsman. 

Savory Custards are made of two kinds, set and liquid. 
They are eminently useful in the feeding of patients suffering 
from affections of the mouth, fauces, pharynx, and larynx. 
Chicken, game, etc., as puree, mixed with panada, are pre- 
pared with yolk. The firm custards are set in the water-bath 
while covered ; the liquid ones are done to point while being 
stirred.

CHAPTEE XIII. 

SOUPS CHARACTERIZED BY MOLLUSCS (SHELLFISH), 
ARTICULATES, FISHES, AND REPTILES. 

Of the soups made with molluscous shellfish, only three 
categories enjoy anything like wide popularity in Europe, 
namely, oyster^ mussel, and vougoli souj). Oyster soups are 
made savoury and meagre, the former generally garnished 
with quenelles of whiting. Six oysters have to be provided 
for each diner. The soup for fast-days is generally made 
more substantial by the addition of small fillets of whiting, 
flounder or eel, and a liaison of yolk. 

Of mussel souio Dumas speaks as his own invention. He 
begins the execution of his recipe ^ith j^iot-ati- feu at 11 a.m., 
and then continues his directions as follows : At 4 p.m. put 
into a great casserole twelve tomatoes and the same number 
of white onions, and let them boil in broth during an hour. 
Then pass them through a tammy, and add to the salted 
and spiced puree 4 oz. of good meat glace. Open the 
mussels by heating them in a casserole, retain the liquid, 
and cut off beards and byssi. Boil them in white wine, with 
an assorted bouquet, chopped carrots, and a small glassful 
of vinegar, some tincture of pepper, and salt. Mix these 
mussels and their sauce with the puree. 

Instead of the mussels, i^raynes, also conchylia, may be 
used. Prawns, shrin^ps, and crayfish may be similarly 
treatf d, but it is preferable to elevate their extract to the 
dignity of bisque. 

The mussel'^ is liable to be unwholesome by occasionally 

* The name of this bivalve marine shellfish should be spelled Tmissel, 
and n<t nivsde. It is a Saxon name for shell, concha; in German, 
Man hel ; french, moule. The species here meant is Mies-Muschel, in 
German. Its zoological ' barbarous binomial ' is Mitylus edulis ; but in

containing a poisonous substance, 7nytilotoxine, an alkaloid. 
But this condition seems limited to mussels which have 
lived in unv^holesome, sewage-contaminated localities, and 
probably been made sick thereby. Cooking seems to 
diminish or destroy the toxicity. 

Vougoli soup used to be a well-made standing dish at the 
restaurant of Mergellina, near the chateau called at Naples 
that of Queen Johanna, although it never was so. A recipe 
given by Dumas'^ is very similar to the foregoing one for 
mussels, but it is in the meagre key of variation. The shell- 
fish called vougoli in Italy are named prayjies in France, 
and are eaten at Marseilles and nearly all seaports of 
France. 

Bisque or crayfish soup, anglice also called bisk and culUs, 
is an interesting product of magiric art. It was called cullis 
in this country probably because it required a cotdis or 
blo7id cle veau for its completion ; but the word is now 
obsolete in England, and as much forgotten as the word 
coulis is by modern French cooks. This fact, to our mind, 
shows better than anything else the state of decadence of 
the art of cookery, and the deterioration of literature, which 
does not even record the means by which the art attained 
its high development. In history we find that a word is 
not often lost unless the thing be lost first, and even then 
the name survives the thing for long periods. We might 
argue that as modern French works do not contain the word 
coulis, the thing itself had been lost ; it has certainly been 
lost for the main purposes for which it was formerly pro- 
duced, and what remains are its weakened reminiscences. 
The appreciation of savour has been diminished down to the 



this also the y is erroneous, and its place should be filled by i, as the 
derivation is not from the Greek fivg (movise), but from the niitulus, 
mutulus. {Cf. 'Heind. at Horat. Sat.,' 2, 4, 28 ; Martial, 3, 60, 4 ; Ath., 
3, p. 85.) The Greek for mussel is tellina. Oyster, Mussel, and Vougoli 
Soup are well garnished with quenelles of whiting. Cf. Y., 336.

i84 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

level of dry champagne, but taste, instead of becoming 
coarse, has stooped to insipidity. 

The French expression hisque signified a soup made from 
crayfish, and was not applied to any other culinary prepara- 
tion without special qualification. It is, therefore, a sufii- 
cient definition, and the expression basque d' ecrevisses is 
perhaps a tautology. 

Bisque is an ancient soup, as is shown by literary refer- 
ences. One of the most spirited allusions to it is by the 
chaplain of Francis I., King of France, Meshn de Saint- 
Gelais, in a poetical letter addressed to a lady : 

' Quand on est febricitant 
Ma dame on se trouve en risque 
Et pour un assez longtemps 
De ne jouer k la brisque, 
Et de mal diner, partant 
De ne point manger de bisque, 
Si rude et si facheux risque 
Que je bisque en y songeant. ' 

Less witty and somewhat inconsistent in its conclusion is 
the description of a gourmand at the time of Boileau : 

' dont la mine fleurie 
Semblait d'ortolans seuls et de bisque nourrie.' 

Most recipes for bisque begin with * Lavez cinquante icre- 
visses,' and the crowd of copyists all repeat, * Wash half a 
hundred crayfish ' ; but as there are at least two varieties 
of crayfish,"^ and as both vary greatly in size, quite apart 
from differences according with their age, this ' dosage ' of 
the basis of the bisque is much too uncertain. The quantity 
of fish to be used should be indicated by the aggregate 
weight as well as the number of fish necessary to make it 
up. The traditional fifty crayfish would probably be of the 

* Syn. Crawfish, Astacus Jluviatilis. Bisque is translated as crawfish 
soup or cuUis simply in Smith and Hamilton (' Eng. -Fr. Diet. '). Brisque is 
a game, jeu de paume, Ang. odds. D.D., 246, gives a receipt of Vuille- 
mot's for bisque, which is faulty as regards the period at, and the circum- 
stances under which, the carapaces of the crayfish are to be pounded and 
extracted. 



BISQUE OR CRAYFISH SOUP 185 

size of prawns. But it must be remembered that of these 
stone crayfish fifty would be equalled in weight by twenty- 
five so-called nohle crayfish {EdelJcrebse in German), and 
yield soup for eight persons. 

To produce bisque, from four to six crayfish of the larger 
size are required — of the smaller variety, about a dozen — for 
each person. After having killed them by skewering, remove 
the gut from each of them by holding the fish in the left 
hand, and with the right thumb and forefinger pulling out 
the central paddle of the tail ; to this the gut will adhere. 
Put the crayfish in a stewpan, add a mirepoix of finely- 
sHced roots and a bouquet of herbs, pepper, and pimento as 
tincture, 2 oz. of butter, a glassful of Madeira or Marsala 
wine, cover with standard broth, and add sufficient thereof 
to make the fish swim. Boil while stirring until the cray- 
fish are all red. Let cool, and pick out the crayfish while 
running the broth into a saucepan. Eemove the meat from 
the tails, and cut it into dice and set it aside. Pound all 
the carapaces, tail-sheaths, and claws included, together 
with six anchovies, some bread fried in butter, and some 
wine or spirit to dissolve the colour ; add the liquid in which 
they have been boiled, and boil again while stirring. Boil 
(to fifty crayfish) 125 grm. of rice, until it forms a thin paste ; 
add this to the boiled pounded carapaces, insure the suffi- 
cient liquidity of the mixture by the addition of broth if 
necessary, and pass through a tammy. Add a piece of 
butter to the puree, and keep it hot in the water-bath. 
Brown some thin slices or dice of bread in butter, and place 
them, together with the dice of the meat of the tails, in 
the soup-tureen, and pour the soup over them. 

Consideration of Proposed Amendments and Practical 
Variations. 

The more we study the art of cookery the greater becomes 
our admiration of the skill and ingenuity which have been 



i86 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

applied to the production of the most characteristic results 
from the given materials. But we also find amendments 
proposed to well-established recipes, which merely exhibit 
the want of information of the authors. Whether in the 
case of bisque to make it clear or thick is a matter of choice, 
but whether the thickening should be effected by a con- 
somme of fried bread in veal-broth or by boiled rice is 
immaterial. Some recipes are distinctly retrograde, and, 
compromising the fundamental idea, do not, in fact, yield a 
true bisque. In one of these the carapaces are not directed 
to be pounded, but left unused, while the meat of the tails, 
constituting the most delicate morsels, is pounded, and sub- 
sequently mostly left on the tammy. As the writer of this 
recipe loses sight of the colouring matter contained in the 
carapaces, which, being itself a fatty matter, unites with 
the butter during the cooking after comminution, particu- 
larly with the aid of a little spirit or wine, it is not sur- 
prising that he prescribes that the butter in which the 
crayfish were done should be coloured with red lobster 
spawn. This trouble, even when feasible, is totally un- 
necessary. The extraction of the pounded carapaces yields 
not only the red colour of the fat, which makes the bisque 
so nice to look at, but also the grand flavour which con- 
stitutes so great an attraction to the gustatory organs. On 
the other hand, the pounding of fleshy tails, while probably 
imparting some flavour to the soup, is destructive of the 
meat, and thereby of the visible proof of the genuineness of 
the bisque, for the tails are a kind of evidence which cannot 
be imitated, not only of the nature, but also of the richness 
of the preparation. 

In some parts of Germany forcemeat and marrow-balls, or 
quenelles, are poached into the soup besides the sliced tails 
and fried bread. The pounding of the carapaces is done in 
the presence of butter, and they are comminuted to a pulp. 
This pulp is now set to fry until the butter is coloured red 



BISQUE-LIKE SOUPS 187 

and begins to rise, and then only the original broth in which 
the crayfish were boiled is added. Some boil the crayfish 
in mere salt water, and throw this away, and liquefy the 
roasted crayfish butter with new stock. They now boil, and 
remove the coloured butter with a spoon during boiling, in 
order not to lose any in the carapace debris during strain- 
ing."^ The soup, after passing the tammy, may be allowed to 
stand until it is clear and cold ; the butter may be skimmed 
off, and the liquid decanted from the deposit. If the latter 
be now clarified with white of egg, clear bisque will result, 
and may be served, with the red butter restored to it, with 
the sliced tail-meat and fried bread immersed. It is the 
analogue of clear turtle, and a great deal more tasty than 
that, whereas the form above given, and to which we attri- 
bute the better quality, corresponds to thick turtle. How- 
f.ver, crayfish soup differs from turtle and most other 
technically accomplished soups in this, that whether it be 
clear or thick, it always contains the red or orange coloured 
crayfish butter, in which the greater part of its characteristic 
flavour is concentrated. To bind and emulge this butter by 
suspension in a starchy medium may be suitable in the case 
of the thick bisque, but for the clear the binding material, 
whether rice or fried bread, would have to be omitted. 
. Compound Bisque is a bisque as above described, augmented 
by additions, particularly when the number of crayfish is 
by itself insufficient to afford material for the necessary 
volume. Mussels and quenelles of whiting blend very well 
with the crayfish tails. 

For potage a la Usque several recipesf exist, all of which 
begin with the production of a coulis d'ecrevisses, produced 
like the extract for the bisque, and subsequently expanded. 
Tails, as well as shells and claws, are to be pounded ; to 

* This has evidently been misunderstood by a writer who prescribes the 
coloured butter to be left out altogether.

the puree of tails white puree of fowl is to be added. 
This combination is useful when a limited number of cray- 
fish has to yield a disproportionately large volume of soup. 
Observe that the correct name is ijotage a la bisque — i.e., a 
bisque-like soup. The coulis d'e'cfevisses serves for the pre- 
paration of soups not only, but of all kinds of entrees, which 
are then termed mo coulis d'dorevisses. 

Grab Soup, Bisque a la Normande, or Potage au Pouparts, 
is a paraphrase of bisque. The crabs to be employed in the 
production of this soup are those which bear the name of 
pouparts on the coast of Normandy. Two dozen of them 
will give a soup for eight persons. 

Compound Crab Soup, made with a large boiled crab, is 
mainly a puree of crab-pulp, thickened with rice or con- 
somme of fried bread, to which the minced flesh of the 
claws is added. 

Compoiind Lobster Soup is a coloured puree of lobster 
flesh with tails of prawns and quenelles of lohiting in broth. 
The colour is furnished by the coral and spawn of hen- 
lobsters. All the flesh is transformed into puree ; the pith, 
as the contents of the lobster's stomach are termed, is 
added to the broth. 

Compound Praion Soup is a puree of prawns and rice in 
broth, with tails of prawns and quenelles of trout, or other 
suitable fish. 

Fish Soups and other Soups for Fast-days. 

The ecclesiastical prohibition of the consumption of meat 
on Fridays and sundry other days, which does not obtain in 
Spain or Portugal, is in other countries obeyed in various 
degrees and modifications. Some purists include all animal 
food above fish in the prohibition ; others use eggs, milk, 
cheese, etc., in contradiction of their avowed principles, 
after the manner of the vegetarians. As all sorts of fish are 
permitted, it is not difficult to compose a sumptuous bill of 



FISH AND VEGETABLE BROTHS 189 

fare for fast-days, except as regards the soup, for nearly all 
soups become inattractive by the absence of savour in the 
shape of broth. This circumstance has, no doubt, con- 
tributed much to the deterioration of soups in general, and 
their gradual abandonment by the healthy part of the 
population. Cooks, however, placed opposite an economical 
demand, have endeavoured to supply substitutes for meat- 
broth in the shape of the following decoctions. 

Fish-Broth. 

Very few fish give an edible broth ; the decoctions of 
most of them are not agreeable to an educated taste, and 
all of them are of no nutritive value ; even the best fish- 
broth must be kept very weak, as when strong it is equally 
unacceptable. As good fish has to furnish the more sub- 
stantial dishes, we have never known it used for the pro- 
duction of fish-broth ; conger eel, which is not very good or 
not very easy to eat, on account of its many prickly bones, 
is used for the production of fish-broth in Bretagne. Most 
fish used for soup is filleted and made into puree, and only 
the skeletons and heads are boiled with herbs and water. 
Thus a flavoured liquid, but without much savoury ex- 
tractive, is obtained. English cooks use flounders, eels, 
and anchovies for making fish broth. 

Vegetable-Broth. 

A kind of vegetable-broth is made from jjeas {bouillon de 
l^ois) and haricot beans by diluting purees and retaining 
the woody particles on the tammy. We have already seen 
how the vegetarians miscall this decoction ' stock,' and 
deceive themselves and inexperienced credulous persons 
with this fallacy ; we have known the growth of young 
children stunted by the application to them of this lament- 
able fad by their faddist mother. 



I90 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Soup Sauces. 
Many of the soups, particularly fish soups, described in 
culinary treatises, are in fact much less soups than some- 
what elongated ragouts. The more solid ingredients of 
such soups are the same as, and undergo preparatory pro- 
cesses similar to, the solid constituents of ragouts. It is 
owing to the recognition of this fact by practical cooks 
that they have termed the liquid part of these complicated 
dishes sou'p sauces. We simply adopt this term as we find 
it, because we believe it to be highly descriptive. When 
our readers come to study sauces, they will see that the 
differences between them and soups are mainly differences 
of concentration. A soup sauce is, shortly defined, a coulis. 
A Becipefor a Savoury Soiqo Sauce, e.g., of Eel Fillets, is the 
following : Cut up small carrots, celery, parsley, roots and 
leaves, shallots, and a liberal number of mushrooms ; add 
thyme, bay-leaf, sweet basil, peppercorns, and mace. Fry 
them in 4 oz. of butter, then add a little wine and three 
pints of standard broth of any origin, and boil for an hour. 
Then strain the broth through a tammy, using any avail- 
able pressure to the residue ; put the liquid into a stewpan, 
thicken it with white roux, and give it an appropriate con- 
sistency, so as to keep it more mobile than sauce ought to 
be. Finish it with a liaison of yolks of eggs, and point 
with tinctures of spices and chopped parsley. Then pour 
this soup sauce over the fried, boiled, or braised fillets of 
eel, or any available crayfish, or prawn-tails, in the soup- 
tureen, and stir gently. 

Out of a great number of so-called fish soups* we indicate 
a selection, partly with definitions : 

Jack or Pike Soup, a soup sauce over fillets of jack ; some 
add puree of almonds and cream panada. 

* A series of recipes for fish soups is collected in D.D., 874 et seq. 
(pike, eel, sole, flounder, sturgeon), mostly ex ' Recipes de la Maison de 
Madame,' an old classic French work. 



FISH SOUPS AND SOUP SAUCES 191 

Conger Eel So2q)* a meagre soup sauce over fillets of 
conger eel. 

Eel Soup of Siueet-ioater Eel, also a potacje maigre, being 
a ragout to be eaten with spoons ; when treated with beef 
broth it becomes gras. 

Compound Eel Soup, composed of soup sauce, sliced eel, 
fillets and tails of crayfish or prawns. 

Eel Soup as made at Hamburg. — The North of Germany, 
owing to its many lakes, is very rich in eels, which are 
there eaten in a great variety of forms of preparation — 
smoked, boiled, fried, in ragout, and particularly as soup. 

Russian Fish Soups. f — The Eussians have several fish 
soups : one termed hholodnoy, of which an ingredient is 
caviare; another called hatvinia, which contains slices of 
salmon. These soups, for which a great variety of pre- 
scriptions exist amongst the Eussians, are mostly meagre 
or fleshless, and consist of a vegetable decoction with the 
usual bulbs, roots, tubers, rhizomes, and herbs, and of 
slices or fillets of fish, such as are available, boiled in salt- 
water, and added to the vegetable liquid. This decoction 
is also made in various more or less complicated forms. In 
one a pint of Sauterne wine is to be put, of which the 
Eussians consume large quantities, and may be supposed 
to like the flavour ; another addition is a liaison of yolks 
and a quantity of cream. Thus, these soups become ragout- 
like, heavy mixtures, calling for a good digestion. A favourite 
fish for producing the fillets is the smelt, and in its absence 
the troiit. 

Haddock Soup is a composition to be made with haddock 
trimmings; the soup is to be improved by the addition of 
cream, and to be made nutritious by the immersion of 
fried eggs, one for each person. The trimmings only, and 
not the fleshy parts, of two haddocks, are to be used for the 

* Conger eel soup rejoices in the name of potage a la Bretonne. 
t For Russian fish soups, cf. Rottenhofer, loc. cit.. p. 75, N. 121. 



192 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



soup. But when it is considered that 1 lb. of fish is 
required to make a pint of eatable fish - broth, these 
trimmings cannot be esteemed to be of sufficient value to 
justify the expenditure and trouble which their cooking 
would involve. 

Fillet of Sole Soup is a bouillon of sole trimmings and 
hones of any fish, such as skate, plaice, etc. ; the exhibition 
of all the cynicism manifested in the treatment of bones, as 
above described, is repeated in the treatment of the bones 
of fish ; most authors recognise the weakness of fish trim- 
mings as a material for the production of fish-broth by pre- 
scribing that they should be boiled in fish stock. Happily 
for the diners, the fillets of sole are to be fried, and to be 
immersed in the soup. It would be advisable to eat them 
by themselves, and to concentrate the soup to a mere 
sauce. 

Compound Fillet of Sole Soup, being a soup sauce with 
fillets of soles, is expanded with red quenelles and mussels. 

ComiJound Fillet of Flounder Soup is an elongated ragout, 
consisting of soup sauce {veloutd) with fillets of (Thaiiies) 
flounders, quenelles of {Spey) trout, a hinding of eggs and 
cream. 

Compound Sturgeon Soups are all expanded stews or 
ragouts made with soup sauce. They may be white or 
brown. 

Brown Sturgeon Soup is an espagnole sauce with morsels 
of sturgeon-flesh and quenelles of lobster. Of 6 lb. of 
sturgeon, 2 lb. only are to be eaten as such, 4 lb. are to 
serve to make the soup sauce. 

In WJiite Sturgeon Soup a white veloute takes the place 
of espagnole. 

Chinese Sturgeon Soup is a beef and veal broth, with pieces 
of the cartilaginous head of the sturgeon, boiled tender, so 
that it can at least be chewed if not digested. The prepara- 
tion of the sturgeon's head begins with splitting it with a 



FISH SOUCHETS 193 



cleaver or saw, and dividing the halves again transversely 
into slices of the size of chops. Soak them in water 
frequently renewed, and then boil them in water until the 
shell is easily detached from the cartilage ; free the latter 
from all pieces of shell, ligaments or flesh ; put it in a stew- 
pan, cover it with standard broth, add the symphony of 
vegetables, and boil for two hours, or until the pieces of 
cartilage have become transparent and rather soft to the 
touch. Drain them on a sieve, and cut them in small 
pieces ; finish the broth, and pour it over the pieces of 
cartilage."^ 

Sturgeon SoujJ with Gurry is the same preparation as the 
foregoing, or soup sauce from sturgeon-flesh-broth with 
white roux and vegetable puree, all flavoured with curry, 
put over sturgeon-head cartilage, garnished with rice. 

Fish Souchets or Souchies. 

The significance of the word * souchet ' or * souchy ' is not 
explained in dictionaries or cookery-books ; it is not used by 
the latest French authors of note, the author of ' D.D.' or 
Gouffe. It might be derived from souche, stump or piece. 
It is often used in combination with the prefix loater, as 
2uater-souchet, or with fish, as fish-souchet.t Most so-called 
water-souchets in cookery-books appear to be stews of fish 
with a thin, gravy-like, savoury sauce ; nevertheless, they 
are ranged under soups. What is given in London taverns 
and restaurants occasionally as water-souchets is mere 
common flat fish — e.g., flounders — cut transversely in large 
slices, and boiled in water with some roots and herbs. We 
have never observed any souchets to be filleted. A souchet

194 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

is not practically treated as a soup, but served after the soup 
as one of the releves consisting of fish. 

Some culinary writers use the expression loatcr-soucliet- 
hroth; this should be * souchet-broth,' as this very broth is 
the result of the transformation of the water. For the 
same reason ' water-souchet ' is a contradiction in terms, 
the more so when, as is done by some, the bi^oth is termed 
the * souchet.' But the souchet is the piece of fish boiled in 
the broth, which latter, though thin, is soup-like and some- 
what savoury. We should, therefore, omit the ordinarily 
prefixed * water ' entirely from our nomenclature. 

Soucliy -Broth. — Some prepare the souchy-broth with the 
trimmings of the fish which they intend to cut up for the 
souchies, but these will yield only a very thin decoction. 
Others make extract of from six to twelve flounders, which, 
properly concentrated, give a good fish broth. Others, 
again, extract the fishy flavour from the trimmings by means 
of weak stock or half standard broth, which gives a good 
flavour. The principal advantage of this souchet-broth will 
be reaped by eating-houses, where scores of fishes can be 
boiled one after the other in the same liquor. For use in 
private houses the souchy process offers no advantage over 
plain boiling. 

Souchies can be made with salmon — in which case they 
become equivalent to dame — sole, flounder, eel, perch, tench, 
trout, char, and other fish. In some cookery-books you are 
directed to send to table brown bread and butter with all 
souchies, a mode of premature stufiing which should be 
discountenanced. The bread-and-butter had better remain 
associated with whitebait only, though even with this it has 
no patent or mystic connection. 

Turtle Soup, Soupe d la Tortue a VAnglaise, is a clear or 
thick gravy soup, containing the gelatinous flaps of the skin 
and some of the green fat of the turtle, and adventitious 
quenelles. Turtles of all sizes yield good skin flaps, but 



TURTLE SOUP 



195 



only medium-sized turtles of about 120 lb. in weight yield 
delicate fat ; the smaller ones are often without any fat at 
all, and in the larger ones the fat is liable to be of bad 
taste. 

The killing and dissecting for the kitchen of a turtle is a 
complicated process, the description of which may be left to 
technical books. The skin at the junction of the head and 
extremities with the body is easily isolated; that under- 
lying the scales of the lower or breast plate, 'plastron, and 
the convex back shell, cara;pace, can only be obtained by 
boiling the shields, cut into small pieces by a bone-saw. 

Most recipes advise that the cook should return the 
stripped bones to the water in which they were boiled for 
the purpose of, by further boiling, extracting all their sup- 
posed savour. This shows how errors, once started, become 
generalised and made permanent. The boiling of these 
bones is perfectly useless, as they, like their relations in 
beef, do not contribute any useful ingredient to the decoc- 
tion, and may, like that decoction itself, be excluded from 
further participation in the process. 

The preparation of turtle stock does not differ from that 
of any of the best soups described above ; but its flavour is 
specialized by the addition of puree of turtle soup herbs, 
which consists of sweet basil, winter savory, marjoram, and 
lemon thyme, besides the usual vegetable symphony. Some 
recipes add wine, such as old madeira, to the soup, which 
others think unnecessary, or even prejudicial. 

The fat is boiled in soup sauce, changing its colour from 
bluish to green. The quenelles are to be shaped like small 
turtle's eggs, and to be poached in broth. 

The traditional recipes for the turtle soup broth do not 
state the actual quantity of soup to be obtained from the 
accurately described materials. We can, however, construct 
from the material its possible maximum strength if it is to 
remain a savoury soup according to our standard. We 



196 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

assume that soup from the proceeds of a turtle of 120 lb. to 
150 lb. has to be made. Taking 3 lb. of raw ham, 40 lb. of 
leg of beef and knuckle of veal, arid the carcases of four old 
hens (as equal to 2 lb. of flesh), we obtain 35 lb. of pure 
flesh. If this were fully extracted, it would be equal to a 
little more than a pound of Proust's extract, and this would 
yield 35 pints of standard broth of such a quality as the 
process actually adopted could never yield. But allowing 
that the greater part of the extractives had actually been 
obtained in solution, they would, with the herbs, roots, etc., 
be sufficient to yield 40 pints, or 5 gallons, of soup, enough 
for more than forty persons. This would be soup better 
than any that is ordinarily obtained, and it might be diluted, 
probably, so as to satisfy a hundred persons. 

If, instead of making the broth from the shins and 
knuckles and old hens just described, it be made by dis- 
solving 1 lb. of Proust's extract in 20 quarts of hot water, 
and boiling in this the butter, sliced ham, and fleshy parts 
of the turtle, the head and flippers, and the symphony of 
Vegetables, turtle spices, and salt, for one hour, four hours* 
work will be saved. If the soup, or half of it, be thickened 
with a roux, the other half be clarified with albumin, and 
each be pointed with tincture of cayenne and lemon- juice, 
and receive its portion of turtle fat and of quenelles, a soup 
will be obtained which is not only one quarter of the price 
of the former, but also of much better quality ; for it will be 
composed of standard broth of which every pint contains 
the soluble ingredient of an entire pound of flesh, free from 
bones and fat. It will not require a stock-pot of greater 
capacity than six gallons, whereas the traditional process 
requires at least one stock-pot of eighteen gallons capacity. 
The new process will, therefore, save space on the hearth, 
reduce the time for cooking the broth from six to three 
hours, and leave as residue only some vegetables, which are 
not anything like so laborious and difficult to manage as 



SOUPS OF FLESH PUREES AND MINCES 197 

the 40 lb. of beef and veal, and their bones. These 30 lb. 
of meat cannot be eaten, and must be finally utilized for 
further extraction with water, and this dilute broth has to 
be reduced by boiling before it becomes fit to be added to 
any culinary preparation. 

Sundriecl Turtle and Preserved Turtle Fat. — The gela- 
tinous or gristly parts of turtle obtained from the skin 
are sold in trade in a dried form, which is said to result 
from their exposure to the sun. They are very hard, and 
in order to become fit for use require to be soaked in luke- 
warm water during a period of not less than four days, 
during which the water must be changed every tw^elve hours. 
When the tissue or skin, say half a pound, is at last so far 
swelled and softened as to allow itself to be cut with a 
knife, it may be divided into the regulation square pieces, 
and boiled in standard broth. To this may be added all the 
herbaceous and spicy materials. 

In some parts of America turtle is cheap, and consumed 
after being cooked in a plain and summary manner. Of 
such turtles the fat is collected in such quantities that it 
can be bought preserved in tins.

SOUPS MADE WITH FLESH PUREES AND MINCES OF 
FOWL, GAME, RABBIT, HARE, ETC.— COCK- A- 
LEEKY, MULLiaATUNNY AND HARE SOUP. 

The soups made with puree from the flesh of the animals 
named in the title of this chapter are uniformly suspensions 
of purees in savoury broth. As the mode of making purees 
is well known, and the production of savoury broths no less 
well, it is not necessary to give details concerning the pre- 
paration of these soups. The most frequently treated are 



198 • THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Chicken Purde So2ips, of which also a number of variations 
are quoted ; but these latter are of no general import. The 
comjjound soups of imrSe of foiul include mere additions, e.g., 
oipurSe of rice, the same with asparagus-heads added, the 
same with p)earl barley and quenelles of foivl, the same with 
purde of almonds. Names given to some of these compounds, 
such as Priyitaniere, Princesse, or Celestine, have no motive, 
and convey no meaning. 

A French soup belonging to this category is chiffonade, 
which in English we shall define as riiincecl chicken soup. 
Chiffon means a rag, also a hunch, broken piece of bread. 
Possibly these meanings point to a connection between 
soup and name. In France the soup is called chiffonade 
simply, without the word * potage ' or ' soup ' being employed 
in connection with it. This seems to indicate that the pre- 
paration was formerly more than a mere soup, probably a 
compound ragout, or one of those substantial soups which 
had to be eaten in two stages — the liquid part with a spoon, 
and the solid part from the same plate, with knife and fork. 
This soup is somewhat analogous to cock-a-leeky. 

Cock-a-leeky is a soup ragout of fowl, strongly flavoured 
with leek. The cock is not de rigueur, but may be replaced 
by capon or fowl.^ The fowls are boiled first and cut up 
in joints ; their broth is then worked up into savoury soup, 
with blond of veal, or coulis, or standard broth. In this 
the white parts of leeks, six to each fowl, previously par- 
boiled, to diminish their potency, are placed and boiled to 
point ; lastly, the carved fowls are added, and the whole is 
just boiled up once more. 

MuUigatunny, or Indian Kari {or Curry), Soup, also called 
MtUligataivny, Mullagataiony, Potage de Kari,\ is a spiced 
or curried soup of hashed chicken and rice. It was originally

buying.

MULLIGA TUNNY SO UP 199 

peculiar to Southern India, and derives its name from the 
Tamil words molegoo (pepper) and tunnee (water). In its 
simple form as partaken of by the poorer natives of 
Madras, it is, as its name indicates, a pepper-water used 
as a sauce, which the Madras cook makes as follows : 
He pounds together a dessertspoonful of tamarinds, six 
red chillies, six cloves of garlic, a tablespoonful of mustard- 
seed, a saltspoonful of fenugreek-seed, twelve black pepper- 
corns, a teaspoonful of salt, and six leaves of karay-jjaiik. 
When the ingredients have been worked to a paste, he adds 
a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter of an 
hour. Concurrently he cuts up two small onions, puts 
them into a chatty, and fries them in a dessertspoonful of 
gee till they begin to turn brown ; now he strains the 
pepper-water into the chatty, and cooks the mixture for 
five minutes, after which it is ready. This pepper-water is 
used as a mere same, for it is eaten with large quantities 
of rice. The English, applying their ideas of further develop- 
ment to this composition, added other condiments, gave 
it a basis of broth with chicken, mutton, etc., thickened the 
Hquid with flour and butter, and by degrees succeeded in 
effecting the evolution of a decidedly characteristic and 
savoury soup. 

The best mulligatunny is nowadays obtained in England, 
where it is presented in the form of a clear as well as in 
that of a thick variety. Some think the former, from an 
artistic point of view, the better one, without, however, 
professing to under-rate the thick. They believe the 
superiority of the English mulligatunny over that com- 
monly prepared in India to be due to the foundation of 
broth, a point which most Indian cooks leave out of con- 
sideration. 

Beciioe for Mulligatunny. — Cut up a large sweet onion 
into thin discs, and fry them in 2 oz. of butter until they 
be about to turn yellow. Stir in three tablespoonfuls of

Barrie's Madras Mulligatunny Paste, adding sufficient 
broth to bring the mixture to the ponsistency of mayon- 
naise. Add a tablespoonful of red-currant jelly and a few 
drops of lemon-juice. Having stirred this mixture well, 
put in a dessertspoonful of Madras chutney, and add 
standard broth enough to produce about three pints of 
soup. Allow this to simmer for a quarter of an hour to 
extract the various flavours of the ingredients; pound 
4 oz. of sweet almonds in a mortar with a little milk, 
not exceeding a breakfastcupful. When the almonds by 
standing have been extracted, strain their milk into the 
soup, and stop the simmering. Pass the w4iole liquid 
through a tin strainer into a bowl, to remove any lumps 
of onion, chutney, etc. Add a roux or thickening of 2 oz; 
of butter and 2 oz. of flour ; heat to the boiling-point, and 
when pouring the soup into the tureen, add either some 
cream or yolk of egg. For the milk of almonds milk of 
cocoanut may be substituted, but the addition of either the 
one or the other of these vegetable emulsions is necessary 
to obtain a soft, creamy, well-flavoured, thick mulligatunny. 

Some details concerning the use and preparation of 
mulligatunny may here follow. When mulligatunny was 
transformed into a soup and ceased to be a sauce, the 
custom to eat boiled rice with or in it was, nevertheless, 
preserved. Boiled fowl or boiled mutton, carved into 
service-slices, was also immersed. Those who object to 
these additions, as making the soup too heavy, may omit 
them. 

If you desire to produce clear mulligatunny soup, avoid 
communicating the flavour with ready-made curry-powder 
or paste in which there is a certain quantity of turmeric. 
Pounded coriander-seed, too, is oily, and would pro- 
bably cause some turbidity. For these reasons put the 
flavouring ingredients into a muslin bag, hang this in the 
soup-kettle with the vegetables, and remove it as soon as 



CURRY OR KARI SOUP 



the broth is sufficiently impregnated with the spices. The 
pepperiness may be imparted with a few drops of tabasco 
as a finishing touch, or of chilli vinegar if tabasco be 
unobtainable. 

Karl or Curry-Poivcler for flavouring Mulligatunny* — 
Such powders can be bought ready-made, but can also be 
compounded as follows : Take 4 oz. of pimento, 3 oz. of 
curcuma {terra merita, i.e., turmeric), J oz. of black pepper, 
a nutmeg, and a scruple of ginger ; powder all very fine, 
and mix carefully. This powder may be added to any 
ragout, composed of mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, sliced 
truffles, quenelles, sliced hard yolks of eggs, slices of sweet- 
bread, cock's-combs, brains and sweetbread of lambs, and 
other ingredients, such as fish and meat. 

.Another more compound list of spices for flavouring 
mulligatunny is the following : 2 oz. of coriander -seed, 
1 oz. of cummin-seed, 1 oz. of fenugreek or meethee, ^ oz. of 
mustard-seed, two cloves of garlic, a dozen black peppercorns, 
and four leaves of kurreeaphol, or kodia-neem (karay-pauk). 
Put all into a muslin bag, without pounding or braising, 
boil with the soup, and remove as soon as the flavour is 
satisfactory. 

It is preferable to make a tincture or alcoholic solution of 
either of these collections of spices, as described above in 
the chapter on tinctures of spices in general, and apply 
the solution in small quantities to the soup. Thus the 
difficulty of making turbid what should be a clear soup is 
avoided; the amount of spiciness to be imparted to the 
soup is entirely in the hands of the cook. In the prepara- 
tion of the broth use turnips sparingly, leeks freely ; also a 
few sprigs of thyme or marjorcmi. 

Kari Soup, or Mulligatunny by evolution from Curry, is 
commonly prepared with tendons of veal (calf's foot), dis- 
membered fowl, zvarren rabbits, and slices of eel, and given

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



with steamed rice. As it is practic^,lly made by expansion 
of the ragout called Indian curry (J^ari), we lead by a recipe 
for this. 

Indian Curry (Kari), or Bagoilt. — Cut a fowl to pieces as 
for a fricassee ; put the pieces into a casserole, together 
with any other meat which you may choose, including some 
fresh or salt pork, a symphony of roots and a bouquet of 
herbs, and good broth. Boil for half an hour, and strain on 
the colander. In a stewpan heat 125 grm. of lard ; fry in 
it three shredded onions, some carrots and celery ; remove 
the fried onions, and pla,ce them in some of the meat- 
broth. Fry the pieces of fowl in the lard, and allow them 
to become yellow ; add two tablespoonfuls of flour and make 
a roux ; dilute with the bouillon from the fowl and the por- 
tion which contains the onions, now to be removed; boil 
up, and add kari-powder to taste, cautiously, as the pimento 
is very hot (ijiment enrage of the French ; long ijepper, 
Anglice). To avoid this excess of heat and improve the 
flavour, some fry the spices with the onions, and thus eflect 
a better amalgamation ; it is still better to use the tincture. 
This ragoiU, when diluted with the necessary amount of 
broth, becomes a souiJ, and this is the archetype of muUiga- 
tunny. Let the soup or the ragout be served with steamed 
or boiled Patna or Carolina rice. Some add apples, shallots, 
leek, and a few cardamom seeds to the ragout. We have a 
number of Indian recipes for curry which differ only in 
unimportant details. All insist on the necessity of having 
a savoury coulis as basis. It is the neglect of this essential 
demand which has brought curries and curry soups into dis- 
credit. 

There is a number of soups to be made of game when 
birds and quadrupeds are plentiful. Quails are now brought 
from Africa by the hundred thousand, and may occasionally 
be used freely in various forms. The birds, cut in quarters, 
may be stewed with julienne vegetables and peas puree, to 



HARE SOUP 203 



which standard broth is added. A more elaborate form of 
Quail Soup* is made with puree of quail's meat all but the 
fillets, which are partly minced and partly made into force- 
meat quenelles, and put in the soup. Snipes, red-legged 
partridges, grouse,j and even pheasants, are similarly mal- 
treated for the production of these artefacts, but practically 
there are made into these game-puree soups only the cold 
remains of heads of game which have been on the table as 
roasts. Some add turnips to the roots, and thereby produce 
a voluminous vegetable puree, of which game forms only 
such a percentage as will justify the name. Some add also 
a binding of eggs to the broth ; others order an addition of 
cream — all expedients intended to overtone the weakness of 
the broth. 

Hare Soup is a ?>Qm.\-c\ed,T purde of hare in standard broth. 
It is semi-clear because the puree is in clouds, and settles 
quickly when the soup is at rest, leaving the soup clear. 
This form has the finest taste, but it may be bound with a 
roux, and become thick. Hare soup is an English dish ; it 
is not used on the Continent, and most French cookery- 
books contain no recipe for its production.! Cut the hare 
into convenient pieces, and fry them, with 2 oz. of butter, 
sliced lean hanj, shallots, onion, mace, thyme, and bay-leaf, 
to a brown colour ; add 2 quarts of standard broth, and boil 
for an hour and a quarter ; then strain the broth from the 
hare, pick the meat off the bones, comminute and pound it 
thoroughly (with a little boiled rice if the soup is to be 
thick) ; then dilute the paste with broth and pass it through 

* Quail soup is by some French writers termed d la Fabert, after Pfere 
Fabert, an ecclesiastic who travelled annually to the Provence in the Bec- 
fgue season, Cf. F., 304. The quail jmree is sometimes mistermed 
bisque— e.g., F., 328. 

t Slices of grouse in grouse soup have been inappropriately called 
'scollops.' 

_ t Gouffe, loc. cit., p. 397, has a recipe, and, as it is an English national 
dish, properly terms it 'd VAnglaUe.'' He prescribes the liaison of blood 
of the hare. This liaison the Germans practise on the ragovit of hare, or 
jugged hiire. 



204 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

a tammy ; unite the rest of the broth with the puree, point 
with a little wine and some tincture of cayenne. 

Variations of Hare Soup consist mainly in additions, such 
as a little currant-jelly or minced fillets of hare, or a liaison 
effected with the blood of the hare. Then there is a Leveret 
Puree Soup, with mince of the fillets and quenelles ; Leveret 
Soup with Kebobs (KJiubabs) ; Babbit Soup, being o, purie of 
rabbit in broth, prepared as a white soup ; Babbit Soup ivith 
custard, the latter coloured with spinach-green, and flavoured 
with Parma cheese and game glaze; Babbit Soup with 
Bai'ley Puree and Quenelles, and Compound Babbit Soup, 
being puree of fillets, with quenelles of fillets in broth 
thickened with veloute sauce. The leveret and rabbit soups 
are mere generalizations from hare soup. 

All these preparations are objects of high culinary art, but 
obey the general principles which we have enunciated in 
previous chapters. Cock-a-leeky, mulligatunny, and hare 
soup are highly characteristic dishes, and, like turtle, have 
a history. They have been modified by the change of taste 
which is ever going on. Thus, the flesh of the turtle, once 
considered the main object of magiric art, does not appear 
to be appreciated or, indeed, eaten by anybody. But the 
other preparations will long survive, and turtle soup will 
vanish only with the extermination of the animals which 
yield the material for its production. 



CHAPTER XV. 

SOUPS REPRESENTING EXPANDED RAGOUTS, OR 
IMMERSED (ENSOUPED) ENTREES. 

The reason for which the dishes falling under this division 
are frequently called soups is probably the circumstance 
that they can be, and mostly are, eaten with a spoon. It 
depends upon the addition of a little more or less gravy 



BOUILLABAISSE, RAVIOLI 205 



whether they are to represent an entree or a soup. Two of 
them, Bouillahaisse and Bavioli, in the countries in which 
they are at home, are served as entrees as well as in the 
form of soups, and the former bears the name of Provencale 
Soiqy. 

Bouillabaisse is a mixture of various sorts of fish, fried 
and braised in olive-oil and wine, with salt and spices, and 
made savoury by a roussi, ^.e., flour fried in oil and flavoured 
with onions. It is essential to the highest form of the 
bouillabaisse that it should be compounded with the chops 
of as many varieties of fish as can be got. Some spell 
Bouilli a baisse, but give no motive. 

Bouillabaisse of Marseille'^ is composed of chops of eel, 
whiting, gurnet, turbot, sole, and other fish. Make a roux 
with oil in the ordinary way, and fry the fish therein ; then 
add standard broth ; boil for half an hour, then simmer 
until the fish be done. Pour the bouillon over fried bread 
in a tureen ; serve the fish in a separate dish. 

Potage a la Bouride et a VAillolis\ is the Proven9ale form 
of bouillabaisse. The fish, bouride, is boiled with garlic, 
spices, wine, and bouillon. To this is added the aiUolis or 
pomade, or mayonnaise made of a clove of garlic pounded 
with salt, worked into an emulsion with yolks and oil The 
boiled fish is further fried until it assumes colour. Bouillon 
and fish are served separately. This dish is too character- 
istically flavoured to be acceptable out of Proven9e. 

Bouillabaisse a la Nimoise. — The Nimes cooks make this 
dish by boiling the fish with fish-broth ; the fishes they use 
are rascanes, moraines, St. Pierres, pagels, loui^s and merlans. 
The broth is made into sauce, and not served as soup ; it is 
thickened with the puree of the liver of a boudroie, well 
boiled in broth, and sustained by a liaison of yolks. The

dish is, therefore, a ragout only, and not used as a soup in 
the locality. 

Bavioli, or Babioles, are an Italian dish, consisting of 
little shells or capsules of thin nouilles paste in which a 
savoury meat farce is enclosed. They are boiled in broth, 
and served with brown gravy, as an entree, particularly to 
open a dejeuner without soup, as is practised in Italy. 
When they are made small, and immersed in a sufficiency 
of broth, they pass as quenelles in Bavioli soup (Baviolis 
a la Najmlitaine*). The preparation of the shells is given 
under 'Nouilles.' The farce is prepared from foiul, game, 
veal, etc. ; add thereto some fresh-made curd of milk and 
some Parma cheese, also some spinach, parboiled, spices an 
salt, and bind with yolh of egg. The farce is enclosed in 
pieces of paste of about 4 inches surface each, then warmed 
on a baking-tin in the oven, immersed in boiling broth — to 
be quickly scalded, so that the broth cannot affect the farce 
— boiled for from five to fifteen minutes, according to size, 
and removed and drained. Some gratinate the ravioli, 
with Parma cheese, and butter poured over it. This treat- 
ment we cannot, from experience, approve of ; the cheese 
becomes adhesive, and spoils the unity of the taste of the 
farce. A concentrated hroion gravy is the best sauce to go 
with ravioli as entree. If they are to be eaten as soup send 
a tureen of clear gravy with them. 

Ox-kidney Soup is really an expanded ragout. 

FoioVs-liver Soup (Potage a la Camerani). — The recipe 
for this soup was given by Grimod de la Eeyniere to his 
circle of convives, but otherwise kept secret. Thus it 
became the object of the fable that its preparation in 1806 
had cost three louis d'or for each diner or person at table. 
This romance was destroyed by Baron Brisse, who gave a 
copy of the recipe to Dumas in a letter, in which this

SOUP OF GIBLETS, HEADS AND TAILS 207 

enthusiastic gastronomer says : ' Je vais faire entrer en 
loetite cuisine et vulgariser I'illustre potage celebre par 
tant de poetes.' Let us add that Camerani was manager 
(se77iainier ]jerioetuel) of the Comedie Itahenne at Paris, and 
an appreciator of good cookery. As for the poetry, if it be 
an effect of the soup, the latter would be misjudged by its 
quality. 

Standard broth and all available vegetables, etc., form 
the liquid. To this are added, just before it is done, foivls' 
livers, one for each person, finely minced, or as puree, and 
on placing in the tureen, some ready-boiled macaroni and 
Parmesan cheese. When the concentrated ingredients are 
placed in layers and gratinated on the surface, the dish 
becomes a ragout, and ceases to be a soup in the modern 
sense. According to some French enthusiasts, * a single 
spoonful will lap the palate in Elysium ; and while one drop 
of it remains on the tongue, each other sense is eclipsed by 
voluptuous thrilling of the lingual nerve. '"^ 



CHAPTER XVI. 

SOUPS MADE FOR THE UTILIZATION OF GIBLETS, 
SKELETONS, HEADS AND TAILS. 

As regards the value of fowls' giblets for soups and pies, 
much misapprehension prevails ; they are worth very little, 
and take a great deal of trouble and time to cook ; they are 
also laborious to eat. Then, gizzards are always hard, and 
of no particular flavour, if not disagreeable. Most frequently, 
however, gizzards form no part of fowls' giblets, but are 
wasted, like the liver, by being trussed up with a skewer 
outside the fowl, and shrivelled or burnt in the roasting. 
For soup, boil the giblets in broth, and pick the edible parts 
* Ex Kitchiner, * Oracle,' p. 55. 



2o8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

off the bones, and, having minced them, put them back into 
the broth. 

Ox-cheek Souf is an elongated ragout. 

Deer's-heacl Soup is the same. Only the heads of young 
deer are suitable for it. It may be useful where deer are 
plentiful ; then it is sometimes prepared a la chasseur. 

Calfs-head or Mock-turtle Soup is an imitation of turtle 
soup ; but as calfs-head soup it can well hold its place, 
without comparison with an expensive luxury. But it is 
sometimes made a mockery of even mock-turtle by having 
distributed in it the flaps of skin of calf's feet, and even pig's 
feet. Its French name is properly potage de tUe de veaic 
' en tortue.^* The preparation resolves itself into boiling the 
calf's head, and cutting it up suitably ; into preparing the 
soup, and uniting both in the tureen. Care must be taken 
not to let this soup become a mockery of good taste in cook- 
ing. A culinary authoress advises the addition to the calf's 
head of a pig's snout and ears, an ox-palate, and a smoked 
tongue ; small sausages, minced sweetbread, veal quenelles, 
chopped hard-boiled eggs, oysters, half a bottle of Madeira 
wine, and two tablespoonfuls of English soy. We believe 
this recipe to be a literary brag, one of those coarse attempts 
to acquire by writing a false appearance of magnificence — 
as has been well said by Dumas, a recipe which is not likely 
ever to be put in practice anywhere. 

A variation is Clear Calfs-head or Mock-turtle Soup. 

Sheep's-head Soup is a laborious preparation of which 
sheep's head forms only a small part, and sheep's pluck 
another. On account of this pluck in its composition it 
has also been called heroic soup. But it would be but poor 
fare for man if it were not improved by adventitious 
ingredients. On the whole, it is not a very practical pre- 
paration. 

Welsh or Pig's-head Sotcp is to be made of a pig's head

OX-TAIL SOUP 209 



after the cheeks have been removed for other purposes. It 
requires much boiHng, and the addition of forcemeat balls 
or egg balls to make it nutritious, and spices and vegetables 
to give it flavour. 

Ox- tail Soup derives its specificity from the pieces of 
ox-tail which are cooked in, and are to be served with it. 
Ox-tail was the first ingredient in the old recipe for julienne 
by Marc Heliot, cook of Louis XV. It is related that this 
soup was not known in England before the abrogation of 
the Edict of Nantes, and that ox-tails had little value. 
French Huguenot emigres are said to have invented the 
soup ; it has, however, become so popular that it is now 
considered a national English soup, and cannot any longer 
be considered as economical as it formerly was on account 
of the cheapness of its principal material. For an ox-tail of 
first quality at present costs from 2s. 6d. to 3s., and, as it 
bears at the most but IJ lb. of flesh, the purchaser pays 
from Is. 8d. to 2s. for the pound of beef, or much more 
than he would pay for prime rump steak. 

An ox-tail dissected gave : («) Pure flesh, 1 lb. 7f oz. ; 
{h) fat, gristle, and tendons, 13| oz. ; (c) hones, 14f oz. 
Total, 3 lb. 4 oz., which had been the weight of the tail; 
the length had been 2 feet 10 inches, which is noted for 
eventual comparison of size. 

It might be supposed that at least a part of the reputa- 
tion of this soup might be due to a particularly nice flavour 
derived from the ox-tails. But as the body of the soup con- 
sists, in all recipes which we have seen, of stock produced 
with the usual materials other than the tails, and enriched 
as usual, the ox-tail goes for very little in its quality. 
The soup is mostly thickened with puree of peas, carrots, 
turnips, lentils, and celery, but then becomes heavy. 

A recipe for Thick Ox-tail Soup may be quoted as an 
illustration of the superstition relating to bones : Take two 
pennyworth of fresh bones, simmer gently with three quarts 

14 



THE SPIRIT OF COOK-ERY 



of water for six hours, then add the ox-tail and the 
vegetable symphony and one quart of water ; ultimately 
add two quarts of stock. This gives a total of six quarts 
of liquid, of which four are water, and two stock of no 
defined strength. Such a process necessarily yields bad 
soup, unless, indeed, two-thirds of the volume of the liquid 
were evaporated. And this would, of course, be a great 
waste of time and coal. In opposition to the advice to 
boil bones of the value of twopence for six hours, we 
counsel our readers to avoid bones, and to produce ox- tail 
soup, if the fancy moves them, on the principles developed 
in our general chapters on broths and soups. 

Calfs-tail Soup is an imitation of the foregoing : calf's 
head, brain, ears, liver, udder, have been glorified by other 
cooks ; a modern writer adds the tail. 

Calfs-feet Soujj is broth with slices of calf's feet, not the 
skin, but merely the tendons, immersed in it ; it is to be 
made nutritious with quenelles, eggs, Parma cheese, and 
boiled macaroni. It is a compound of which the philo- 
sophy is difficult to discover. The calf's feet require four 
hours' gentle ebullition ; the tendons are to have a trans- 
parent appearance,"^ to be cut into slices, and to be put 
into the soup.

011a and Puchero. 

Olla is not a soup, but a bouilli, a ragout immersed in 
bouillon only, without thick sauce ; it is eaten not with a 
spoon, but with knife and fork. It is a Spanish dish, and 

Cf. ¥., 35.5. Cow heel from the tripe-shop would be a good material 
to replace calf's feet. 



NATIONAL SOUPS AND COMPOUND DISHES 211 



greatly differs from what in Spain is called soup — so])a. It 
is usual in more northern lands to call, from hearsay, this 
dish olla potrida, and to combine with the name a con- 
fused idea of a mixture of over-ripe eatable things. But 
we have in Spain itself never met with the dish except 
under the simple name of olla; the adjective ijotrida, a 
residue, perhaps, of former times, when it passed into de- 
scriptions of travels, survived in books, while it has been 
lost in Spain ; i:)otrida comes from podrir, to simmer, a 
metaphorical verb, like that ' to sweat,' meaning to suffer 
slight frying. The olla is a very compound dish, and the 
result of gradual evolution out of a simpler form, tlie imchero. 

Puchero,'^ though also a compound dish, is an organized 
unity, a reasonable assemblage of materials necessary for a 
nutritious, tasty meal. It consists of vegetable and animal 
matters in suitable proportions, stewed in one vessel, until 
the juices have completely penetrated the ingredients, while 
the solids preserve much of their shape and appearance. 
The puchero is also free from bones, and they take no share 
in its production. 

The animal ingredient is mostlj mutton (carnero), the best 
and most easily obtained butcher's meat in Spain. An alterna- 
tive or adjunct is flesh from the heifer or ox (vaca)j. The 
vegetables, which are added later, are white cabbage, kohlrabi, 
broccoli, carrots, and particularly garbancos, the great yellow 
peas called chick-peas in English, kicher-erbsen in German, 
and pois-chiches in French, favourites of the Spaniards. The 
cooks of the lower classes add tomatoes, leeks, and onions, 
and those of the well-to-do add the small saveloys or sausages 
called chorizosjl made in Estremadura, of pork and veal 

* Cf. & fragment by Ernst Kriisch, in the appendix to Konig's ' Geist der 
Kochkunst,' ed. by Baron Rumohr, p. 191. Kriisch was, about 1830, host 
iof the Bear Inn at Aranjuez, near Madrid. 

t In Spain, ox-beef goes by the name of vaca ; as Dumas says : ' In 
iSpain, the moment the ox is killed, it becomes coio.'

212 THE SPIRIT OF COOkERY 

mixed (falsely alleged to be made of mule's flesh), and sold 
throughout Spain ; their flavour is good, but they are very 
hard and tough. Others add a piece of bacon (tocino) or of 
ham (jamon), which introduces a sufficiency of the fatty 
element besides flavour. This stew, for service at the 
table, is placed in a large dish, and sometimes garnished 
with fried or poached eggs. The gravy, concentrated and 
tasty, is eaten with sippets of white bread. 

It is easily seen that the olla is only a more complicated 
form of the puchero. Kriisch describes the olla when just 
served on the table as looking like a mountain, surrounded 
by depository strata, breccias, and nests of alluvial forma- 
tion ; the gigantic * steert-piece ' of beef is the central basal 
granite, round which the rings of chorizos alternate with 
the savoury herbs, and descend to the foot, where garbangos 
represent the rolled boulders. Such an olla requires 
large arrangements, great dexterity of the cook, and a 
numerous assembly to do justice to so large a collection 
of prime food ; and for this reason the olla is not by any 
means a national dish, not even a popular dish, but one 
reserved for the use of large establishments on special 
occasions. The puchero, however, can be made in all pro- 
portions, and with any additions which accident or^ a 
well-supplied market offers, and which may suit any income 
and any tongue. 

In France this dish is termed oille, and seems to have 
been as national as puchero is in Spain, although its origin 
in Spain is not questioned ; it was a substantial ragoiit soup 
at the time of Louis XIII., whose cooks, with their con- 
temporaries, termed it grand ouille ; it is the ouille an iJOt- 
mentioned in the letters of Madame de Maintenon. 

The veritable olla has never been much used in France, 
but in the establishment of the Spanish Ambassador at 
Paris the ragout formed part of the diplomatic representa- 
tion and the official ceremonial. A grandee of Spain or a 



NATIONAL SOUPS AND COMPOUND DISHES 213 

titulado of Castile also thinks the olla obhgatory on feast- 
days. 

But the French have an oilh d la Francaise which is 
adaptable to moderate demands, and can be produced in 
smaller proportions, while it is probably better in quality 
than the colossal olla. This, therefore, corresponds to the 
puchero ; it is ^j)/aiJ de relevd. 

The oille en jjotage d VanciennG mode presents several 
interesting features, one of which is that the pigeons and 
the hen to be used in it are stuffed luith a farce made with 
bread and bouillon, egg-yolks, an onion baked in ashes, 
and hashed bottoms of artichokes, besides green herbs, 
spices, and salt ; then there is beef and veal in large slices, 
and all soup vegetables in volume ; broth or water is added. 
The pot is heated to boiling, and then allowed to simmer 
for five hours. The cook then makes gratinated crusts in 
a metal dish, and reduces the bouillon until the crusts 
begin to adhere to the dish. On this basis the meat, 
fowl and pigeons are served and carved ; the soup is then 
presented in a separate dish or tureen.* 

The first and indispensable ingredient of the olla is a 
volume of good bouillon ; into this beef in cubical slices is 
immersed ; upon this follows a quantity of mutton, some 
pounds of veal gristle, a cut of ham, a chicken, two pigeons, 
a duck, two partridges, two quails, a pound of bacon, 
chorizos, garban90s (these should have been soaked in water 
for twenty-four hours previously). The spices are placed in a 
muslin bag. The vegetables are separately prepared, namely, 
cabbage lettuces, carrots, turnips, boiled with the fat top 
broth of the olla ; in another vessel are boiled, also with 
broth from the olla, bottoms of artichokes, onions, green 
haricots, slices of cucumber, points of asparagus, and green 

* The two soups described (D.D., 869) as a la Grhnod de la Re,g7iiere 
and a lajambe de bois — recipes by the editor of the ' Almanach des Gour- 
mands ' — are mere imitations of the oille en potage. 



214 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

peas. The meat and vegetables are then arranged on a 
large dish like a mountain, as described above ; and in this 
arrangement the cook has much opportunity for the display 
of ingenuity. The meat is most conveniently carved before 
being arranged upon the plate. It is also glazed with a 
coulis made of inspissated broth of the olla, or prepared 
beforehand. The broth or soup is freed from fat, clarified, 
and served in a tureen apart. The latter may be eaten 
apart, and the meat and vegetables after, or the vegetables 
may be cut up with knife and fork, drenched with soup, and 
the whole be eaten with a spoon. This latter method, 
though apparently less elegant, affords the broadest feast of 
gustation. 

The oille a la Francaise includes all the ingredients of 
the puchero, and cervelas (sausages) instead of chorizos, and 
is to be dressed as above described for olla."^ 

OilU gratinee a la Navarroise only differs from the above 
by the addition of two quarters of fat goose. 

The smallest and simplest olla may be tasty and good. 
While travelling in Spain we ate so-called olla — in reality 
puchero — almost daily, and always found it good. 

The Castilian used to eat his puchero at about two o'clock; 
at six he took again, as in the morning, chocolate — if he had 
a guest, with ices and pastry ; at eleven o'clock at night he 
supped on guisado, a stew of beef, veal, and potatoes, which 
was put on the fire just after the mid-day meal had been 
eaten. 

'" The cooks composed their ouilles as we compose our soups of the nine- 
teenth century — with consommes, fumets, and purees in coulis. They 
gave the name of soups to ragoAts (which we have termed ensouped 
entrees), such as that of partridges with cabbage, of poularde with white 
onions, of ducklings with turnips, of sweetbread in white glace. These 
latter were served in deep oval dishes, the consommes separately, but 
mixed on the plate. The ouilles were served in vessels called avant-pots a 
ouilles. When the ouilles made room for the soups, the vessels became 
soupieres, and the ragofits were either called potages, or resumed their 
former name, or became drowned in consomme or any kind of bouillon — in 
short, ensouped,

In Galicia the dish which in the rest of Spain is called 
puchero is supplanted by the caldo, a kind of soup with 
vegetables, roots, haricots, fresh and salt pork ; it is also 
eaten by the Gallegos who work in Portugal. We were told 
that they like the pork a little rancid. The chocolate, very 
thick in Spain, is very thin in Galicia, and served in large 
cups. 

Fish, fowl, a>nd game are excellent in Spain, but frequently 
spoiled in the preparation. Many Spaniards do not eat 
hare, alleging that it scratches the earth to dig up the dead. 
The red-legged i)artridge is common and good. In Galicia 
fish is mostly excellent, and the salted sardine, fried in oil, 
is a daily consolation for breakfast. Tunny is caught and 
preserved in oil at Castroreale. It is eaten either as it 
arrives in the small barrels, or stewed again with tomatoes, 
or mixed with eggs as an omelette, or sauced with 
pimentos. 

The epanada is a colossal raised pie, a loaf with meat 
baked in its inside. The dough to be used for it is fetched 
from the bread-baker's, kneaded with lard, and formed into 
a round cake with a cavity in the centre ; into this the meat, 
previously fried and roasted, is placed, six to eight pigeons, 
a smaller number of pullets, or pork or veal ; this is covered 
with a flap of the same dough, and sent to be baked in the 
baker's oven. When done it is carried to the place where 
the feast is to be. Fish, when placed in the epanada, is not 
previously fried or cooked. 

The Catalans have the longuet, a long thin roll, excavated 
and filled with forcemeat, and fried in oil or lard. They 
put into such forcemeat dried prunes, which also enter 
into the stuffing of fowls and turkeys, and into ragouts and 
fricandeaus. 

Sopa, or Simnish Soici) a VAncienne, is a true soup in one 
sense, and ought never to be confounded with the olla or 
the puchero. It is by some made as nutritive as the piot-

cm-feu, and this has perhaps given rise to the confusion of 
names. 

Polish PiagoM or Soup (Barszcze). — This is an expanded 
ragout of many ingredients, coloured with fermented and 
fresh juice of red beetroot. There is no collateral consomme 
or broth added, but the compound depends for savour on 
such as its ingredients yield by five hours' boiling. Some 
term the dish Borsch, an abbreviation of the word in the 
title, or Polish Soup, and place it amongst the national 
soups. It is doubtful whether this name is not connected 
with Porsch, the East German name of Savoy cabbage, and 
of a ragout made therewith. The ingredients are various 
descriptions of meat and vegetables, much in the style of 
the olla ; then a red glace and a julienne, of which red beet- 
root is the prevailing ingredient, quenelles of fillet of beef, 
farcied eggs. When all are done separately, the meat is 
carved free from bone, and cut in dice, put into the soup- 
tureen, the quenelles and eggs are added, and the bouillon, 
carefully prepared and spiced, is put over all. The red 
beetroot juice is made by grating a number of beetroots, 
and fermenting the pulp with yeast in a protected vessel. 
Some add also directly expressed juice, as well as beetroot 
in substance, to the dish, which in consequence has a deep- 
red colour."^ 

Bussian Soup (Ouka). — This is a gravy soup of veal, fowl, 
etc., with souchets of salmon, eel, perch, and mullet, 
quenelles of whiting, lobster coral, and mushroom puree. 
It has some analogy to bouillabaisse. 

Bussian Cabbage Soup (Tschi) is a broth soup, with 
onions, cabbage, and quenelles. 

Pilau, or Pilaff, Turkish Pilaff, Zurdah Pilatuo. — The 
pilau can be made with fowl or lamb, or fowl and lamb 
mixed, or capon, or turkey. Some Europeans in India put

slices of raw ham into the pilau-pot ; but this is in strict- 
ness inadmissible, as the pilau is essentially a Mussulman 
dish. The following is an Indian recipe"^ : Take 1 seer of 
good rice, 1 seer of butter, 2 fowls (or other meat as above), 
3 pahs of almonds, J lb. of raisins (sultanas), 1 oz. of a mix- 
ture of allspice, powdered mace, cardamoms, cloves, 1 tolah 
of saffron, 1 fresh onion, 2 oz. ginger, 1 oz. salt, J oz. whole 
black pepper, 1 lb. dhiey. Boil the rice till it is half done ; 
fry the onions in the butter until they are brown ; then take 
them out and put in the raisins till they are fried, and take 
them out, or boil the raisins. Then cut the fowls to pieces, 
and rub them over with the ginger and dhiey, and allow 
them to remain in this state two hours ; put some butter at 
the bottom of a casserole, over this put a layer of rice, over 
this distribute some of the onions, raisins, and almonds ; 
sprinkling it with saffron and water, then put a layer of the 
meat, and so on alternately till the vessel is filled ; then 
pour the butter over it ; cover the casserole and close it 
with paste, so that little steam may escape ; put it between 
a slow top and bottom, or braising, heat, or in an oven, and 
cook it three hours. 

Valencia Bice, or Arroz a la Valenciana, is a dish supposed 
to be of Moorish origin. The rice is boiled granular, open, 
and soft, but not pasty. It is then mixed with a combina- 
tion of oil and tomatoes, whereby it receives a beautiful 
yellow colour. 

Pepper -i)ot Soup is an East Indian dish, consisting of a 
julienne soup with dice of pickled pork, veal, fowl, and the 
meat of a good- sized crab. 

Chinese BircVs-nest Soup is also coWQdi Indian and Batavia 
Soup. The Japanese call the nests Sunan, the Chinese 
Salangan. They are the nests of the marine rock-swallows, 
Alcyo petrmis, which breed in caverns on islands of the

Pacific. The nests consist of marine algce, (fucus or vareck, 
or others) mixed with small feathers. They have to be 
steeped in water or broth for at least twelve hours, and 
when the feathers have been picked out with a forceps, 
must be finely sliced, and boiled in standard broth until 
tender. They are then placed in the finished gravy-broth, 
which should never be made thick, so that the slices of 
algae be perfectly visible. 

Japanese Beclie de Mer Soup. — The animal passing under 
the French name Mche is taken in the Japanese seas and 
dried. When it is well cooked it yields a trembling, coherent, 
gelatinous mass. It is immersed in a savoury soup, and 
constitutes a first-rate delicacy. 

Chutnees or Chutneys. 

Chutnees* are compounds of sweet and acid fruit with 
sugar and spices. They perform the function of sharp 
sauces and of salads at the same time, and may be termed 
the little hors-d'oeuvres of the curry service. They used to 
accompany curries, and were served on small plates along 
with the rice. But with the disappearance of curries from 
the bill-of-fare of modern dinners, chutnees also have fallen 
into desuetude, owing probably to excess of spices with 
which makers used to impregnate them. Fresh chutnees 
should be served in saucers upon a tray, and several varieties 
may be presented for selection. Caviare, dressed with a 
little lemon-juice and a trace of cayenne pepper ; other roes 
of fish pounded with a little butter ; potted prawns, potted 
ham, crab paste, lobster paste, and sardine paste, can accom- 
pany the chutnees. 

Tomato Chutnee is made with the pulp of the love-apple, 
some onion, celery, green chillies, all chopped, and salt and 
vinegar. It differs from an ordinary salad only by the 
absence of oil. 

* Cf. for Gen. Observ., ' Wyvern,' loc. cit. 



NATIONAL SOUPS AND COMPOUND DISHES 219 

Cucumber Chutnee is analogous, but oil is added, and the 
vinegar is mixed with sugar. 

Bunjal Chutnee is made with the pulp of the boiled bunjal. 

Cocoanut Chutnee is made with the pulp of the pounded 
cocoanut. 

Mint Chutnee should be made with scalded mint, and 
sweetened. 

Cranberry Chutnee is made of preserved cranberries, made 
mustard, and pounded preserved ginger. 

Cranberry and Tamarind Chutnee has tamarind - pulp 
added to the former, also chillies and mustard-seed. 

Mashed-potato Chutnee obtains its flavour by the addition 
of minced onions, green chillies, salt, pepper, vinegar, and 
some sugar to mashed potato. 

We are in possession of a number of recipes extracted 
from Anglo-Indian records. Products very similar to those 
described in these recipes are sold as preserves in trade. 

Mango Chutnee is the most pleasing and original recipe, 
from the late Captain McMorind, dated Mossoorie, May, 
IBiO. Next come

Troup).

name, currants or raisins, ginger, red pepper or chillies, 
garlic, mustard-seed, sugar, and vinegar. 

Grand Salad, an Old English Chutnee. 

Joan CromivelV s Grand Salad "^ is composed of equal parts 
of almonds, raisins, capers, pickled cucumber, shrimps, and 
boiled turnips. It may be made with cream, oiled butter, 
some good jelly of meat, Florence oil, and flavoured with 
salad mixture, vinegar, lemon and herbs. It is best classified

with the chutnees as sohd sauces, but with these might also 
be ranged under salads, to which it forms an evident 
transition. The fact that this salad bears the name of the 
daughter of the Protector proves that these confections are 
not so exclusively Indian as some would have us to assume. 
The original mustard, a confection of powdered sinapis-seed 
with condensed fruit-juice, or must, and which was so closely 
associated with the seed that it transferred its name to it, 
and even to the plant, was also a cJmtnee until, to its great 
deterioration, the fruity ingredient was left out. 

Curry (Karl) Powders and Pastes. 

Curry powders and pastes are mixtures of spices intended 
to be added to ragouts and soups of meat. They all con- 
tain turmeric, ginger, coriander -seeds, cardamom -seeds, 
caraway-seeds, black and red pepper, and some cloves ; to 
some, pounded lychees are added, which impart sweetness. 
Coriander and fenugreek seeds should be parched before 
being added. Some add cummin, poppy, and mustard 
seeds. When such a powder is mixed w^ith moist sugar 
or pounded raisins, some lemon or lime juice, or vinegar 
and red-currant jelly, it becomes curry -paste. The paste 
is preferable to the powder, as it acts more quickly, and 
aids in the extraction of the spicy parts from the powders. 
This is effected still more thoroughly by making a tincture 
or spirituous extract of the poivcler, and adding of tbis small 
portions to the dish to be spiced, until the desired strength 
of taste be obtained. 

Curries considered as Fricassees. 

The process to be followed in cooking a chicken curry 
differs from that used for the preparation of a ragout or a 
fricassee only by the additions. Cut up a young chicken 
as for a fricassee, and dust the pieces over with flour from 



NATIONAL SOUPS AND COMPOUND DISHES 221 

a dredger. Next prepare the coulis or mirepoix by frying 
onions in butter to a yellow-brown colour, add curry powder 
or paste, and fry these, then add by degrees some cocoanut- 
milk, and later some broth. Simmer to reduce, and place 
in water-bath. Fry the pieces of chicken in butter or 
suet to a light colour, and transfer them to the mirepoix; 
let stand in the water-bath for the meat to assume the curry 
flavour. Place the stewpan over the fire and boil gently, 
taking care that the chicken be immersed ; if more fluid be 
wanted, fill up with standard broth from Proust's extract of 
meat. Adjust acidity, sweetness, and spice ; when the fowl 
is done, add some cocoanut emulsion. In case you prefer 
a thicker sauce, which characterizes a dry curry, con- 
centrate it over the fire or in the oven. 

The soaking of the meat in the liquid curry stuff is im- 
portant, especially when previously cooked meat is to be 
curried. A salmis or a hash tastes much better if the meat 
of which it is composed has been marinaded for an hour 
or two hours before it is finally heated up in the gravy or 
sauce composed for it. It is the same with curry, and gives 
it time to become penetrated by the flavour. This explains 
why a warmed curry not rarely tastes better than a fresh one. 
If a gravy curry, says * Wyvern ' in concluding his learned 
chapter on curries, be kept during the night following its 
preparation in a porcelain curry-dish, and be revivified the 
next morning with some fresh butter, onion, and a little 
gravy, it ought to be found better than on the previous 
night, since the meat has become thoroughly flavoured by 
the curry gravy, while the latter has become reduced in 
volume and strengthened by the second simmering. 

The curries made of fresh fish, prawns, and shellfish 
require a somewhat different process, while those of minced 
cooked meat, tinned or cooked fish, dressed vegetables, and 
hard-boiled eggs, merely require to be gently heated up in 
a curry gravy. 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Varieties of Curry. 

There is a considerable number of tyiyical varieties of curry, 
of which we will mention a selection. The most noteworthy 
are the Malay or Ceylon curry ; secondly, the Moll of the 
Tamils of Southern India, a near relative of the Malay 
curry (the name being, perhaps, the same word a little 
differently spelled and pronounced) ; thirdly, the Kubah 
curry, a kind of grill ; and fourthly, the Quoorma, pro- 
bably so called from the root known to us as curcuma or 
turmeric (haldee). 

The Malay or Ceylon Curry is peculiar to places where 
the cocoanut is extensively grown and appreciated. Vege- 
tables of the cucumis or gourd tribe are well adapted 
for its production ; next are shellfish and ordinary fish, and 
next chicken or other white meat. The fricassee is rich 
with the flavour of the juice of the cocoanut, and delicately 
spiced with mild condiments. It ought to be by no means 
peppery or hot, though some tincture of red and green 
chillies may be cautiously added. Instead of cocoanut- 
milk, that of almonds or Brazil nuts may be used, also the 
milk of pounded poppy-seeds. Agreeable combinations are 
prawns and cucumber, crab with gourd, and firm flesh, fish, 
or chicken, with either of these vegetables. 

The Moli Curry differs so little from the foregoing that it 
does not require a separate sketch. 

Kubab (Kebob) Curries in great variety are described in 
old Indian-English cookery-books, and owing to their condi- 
ments and ingredients were probably appreciated by early 
Anglo-Indians who adopted an almost Oriental mode of life 
more than by moderns. The best kubab curry is one made of 
tender mutton or veal, and treated as follows : Cut the mutton 
into pieces about an inch square and half an inch thick ; 
carve some slices of bacon, some pieces an inch square also, 
but only an eighth of an inch thick ; cut up some pieces of 



NATIONAL SOUPS AND COMPOUND DISHES 223 

parboiled onions to the same size as the bacon, and some 
thin slices of green ginger to match. Impale these pieces 
upon small plated or silver or wooden skewers, in the order 
of mutton, bacon, onion, ginger. Fill the skewer in this 
wise, and sprinkle with curry-powder ; you now either grill 
the kubabs before the fire, while basting them a little with 
butter and gravy, or fry them in butter in a saucepan, with 
some onion, sugar, and butter, and put them in a curry 
sauce as above described. 

Quoorma Curry was one of the most esteemed curries of 
the Madras Club. It was made with mutton as meat, in 
the manner sufficiently described in the foregoing. The 
"curry stuff, or mirepoix, received an addition of milk of 
almonds and of cream of cow's milk. Turmeric (quoorma) 
and sugar were added together, and after boiling the curry 
was pointed with juice of lemon or limes. This is a rich 
but, owing to the absence of chilli, a mild curry ; and this 
mildness constitutes in the opinion of many its chief 
attraction. 

A mode of rapidly preimring a curry''' is the following : 
Make curry stuff (mirepoix) by frying onions in butter, add 
curry-powder, and fry a little more ; then add the meat cut 
into kebobs, and fry until the meat be well browned ; then 
add a little good broth to obtain a thick sauce, and simmer 
for a few minutes.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF SAUCES. 

Theory of Sauce as derived from its History. 
Solid varieties of food, soluble only by digestion, are not 
rarely dry in substance, or unattractive in taste, or in-

224 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

sufficiently or too strongly flavoured. To make such dry 
food moister, to lubricate it and thus aid in its use, to 
increase the attractiveness of the taste by additions of 
flavours and juxtaposition of contrast, to hide or mask 
excessive flavours, certain liquid additions have been in- 
vented which pass by the name of sauces. 

A liquid such as we now define as a sauce the Eoraans 
termed jus, but it is uncertain how far they distinguished 
between meat juice or gravy and accessory liquids such as 
we now term soups. This word jus remains in French, but 
with a more closely circumscribed significance, namely, 
gravy. This may not be a compound, but merely the juice 
issuing from the meat, or extracted from it by direct means. 
The mere addition of hot w^ater to jus makes it bouillon. 
Jus and bouillon are the bases of all sauces and soups. 
Sauces are no longer comprised under the Eoman term^^ra 
(the plural of jus), although this expression had prevailed 
for centuries, and been current in the Middle Ages. It is 
surmised that the jura became in practice gradually mixed 
with the artificially-prepared solutions in which meat was 
preserved or matured for cooking, and thus the salsugo or 
salsilago of Pliny, the briny pickle in which meat was 
stowed away, furnished the name for the liquid with the aid 
of which it was eaten. When salt was rare, salted jura 
were of much greater importance than they are now, when 
salt is prudently mixed with all appropriate dishes, and 
placed before the eater for use at his discretion. Thus a 
standard jus became a salsum or a salsa, in Italian salza, 
which the French transformed into saulza, and ultimately 
into sauce. 

The importance of sauce as a lubricating principle is 
easily demonstrated by an experiment on potatoes made 
with and without any sauce. But if a sauce, in addition to 
lubricating the morsel, also stimulates the organs of taste, 
it causes an increase of the salivary secretion, and by thus 



ENGLISH SA UCES 225 

enhancing the appetite and augmenting the juices capable 
of effecting digestion, increases the pleasure derived from 
eating, and the usefulness of the result in the shape of 
improved nutrition. 

The physiological principle of the preparation of food 
is summed up in the postulate that it shall produce 
the highest efficiency in the individual and the race. Ex- 
perience teaches that as regards the human subject it 
cannot be attained by the greatest simplicity, but, on the 
contrary, is best attained by high quality of materials and 
preparation, for every item of which the most cogent 
physiological reasons can be given, derived from the con- 
sideration of man's place in nature, his structural abilities 
and inextinguishable rational desires. Thus, a sauce 
becomes transformed from an accident into a necessity ; it 
is a want long before soups and made dishes, and when it is 
missing, salt, and salt only, can supply a substitute as a 
corrective of taste and a stimulant of gustation and secre- 
tion. Salt, mustard, and pepper are the most elementary 
appetisers, correctors of taste, and overwhelmers of nausea, 
such, e.g., as is easily produced by overripe or peculiarly- 
flavoured meat. The rice-eating populations of the borders 
of the Pacific Ocean, and of many of its islands, have as the 
most elementary spice, millions of other human beings as 
their only spice, a pinch of pepper. 

With the complete appreciation of essence of meat, sauces 
assumed a new and much more important position. They 
lost again a portion of that importance by the competition 
of soup. But the French people correctly held fast to the 
tradition concerning sauces, preserved and augmented their 
number, and improved their quality. 

The English sauce called melted butter is equal to 
bechamel or allemande whenever well made. It lends itself 
to a great variety of derivatives by additions, and thus 
forms characteristic fish sauces or savoury sauces with 

15 



226 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

ragouts. The English table has sauces such as no other 
kitchen produces ; indeed, the gravies of roast beef and 
mutton are equal to a hecatomb of sauces. It has egg 
sauce for vegetables, bread sauce for game, and a most 
pleasing variety of fruit sauces, such as of apples, goose- 
berries, currant-jelly, and others, audit has three exquisitely 
British sauces — mint sauce, the complement of roast lamb ; 
caper sauce, the complement of boiled mutton ; and onion 
sauce, the complement of roast shoulder of mutton. The 
specificity of several of the sauces of the English kitchen is 
well indicated by a series of proverbs and anecdotes, which 
are for the most part so well known that they do not require 
repetition. 

The subject of the appropriateness of sauces to certain 
kinds of meat just touched upon admits of much dietetic and 
aesthetic consideration, which may be continued in other 
places. Magirics have said truly that sauces accomplish a 
variety of objects ; their proper application reveals the man 
of taste, and their practical production is a constant oppor- 
tunity for the exhibition of the minor qualities, such as 
dexterity, of a goo^ cook. 

Sauces may be intended to act upon taste by homogeneity 
or by contrast. In the former case they must be made to 
conform to or to iterate the taste of the meat with which 
they are to be eaten. An attentive reader of a good cookery- 
book will find this carried out in many recipes. Thus, fish 
sauce may be improved by the addition of meat bouillon, or 
even fish bouillon if made from the muscular tissue of fish, 
and not from mere bones and gristle parings. Sauces of 
milk, cream, eggs, and butter, go well with preparations of 
flour, such as puddings and cakes ; but purees and sauces of 
acidulous fruit and jellies eaten with such pastry act by 
contrast, and sliarpen the desire. 

Sauces, then, are of various kinds ; some are bland ^ 
expressed to the eye by light colour, ivliite sauces, with 



MADE SAUCES 227 



veloute as base and type. In the production of these the 
essence of meat must not be too strong in itself, and the 
flavour of herbs must be kept subdued. The pronounced- 
tasting brown sauces, or espagnoles, may contain the maximum 
of herbaceous flavour, and a fair amount of spices. Piquant 
sauces are yet stronger appellants to the tongue and palate ; 
in them the savoury taste of broth falls to the background, 
and spices, aromatic herbs, and organic acids assume the 
ascendant. 

Meat gravy i'& best left by itself, without any addition except 
salt, and without any dilution except with a little broth in 
case it should be too concentrated. From this it follows 
that gravy, as it is obtained only in limited quantity, must 
also be served in small quantities ; if it be concentrated 
enough, a thin covering of the morsel is sufiicient to indue it 
with the taste sought for. Long gravies are made at the 
cost of quality by undue dilution, and whenever gravy is 
required in quantity it should be produced expressly from 
new materials. 

But the made sauces, however practically concentrated the 
stock may be from which they are to be produced, require 
the addition of a material, by which their body is carried, 
made adhesive, transportable on the morsel, and unctuous 
on the tongue. This material is dextrine, a transformation 
product of starch, and starch itself, in brown sauces dextrine 
bereft of a portion of its constituent water, a caramel of 
dextrine. This material may be prepared in many ways, 
but in the kitchen is made by heating starch, or flour, in 
any available fat, butter, lard, or oil. In this process the 
fat only serves as a carrier of heat to a degree much exceed- 
ing the heat of boiling water ; it mostly takes no part in the 
subsequent stages of the cooking, and when the dextrin and 
dehydrated or brown dextrin are once produced, much 
trouble is taken to again remove the fat from the sauce pre- 
pared with its aid. Amyium, or flour browned or coloured. 



228 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

in hot fat, is called roux, from its red colour. But colour is 
not essential to the quality of flour heated in fat to become 
a binding material, for dextrine is colourless ; but this colour- 
less binding material has no name of its own in cuHnary 
language ; it passes by the name, involving a contradiction 
in terms, of ivliite roux. Like the figure 1, which is the 
beginning of a number, so a white roux is the beginning 
of a roux actual. It would be useless to try to eliminate 
terms established by daily use in kitchens, and we there- 
fore deal with them as we find them, reserving our belief in 
the unlimited improvability of mankind, particularly that 
portion of it which is devoted to cooking. 

Now, these dextrines, red and white, on coming in contact 
with hot water swell up into more or less viscous, or gela- 
tinous, or adhesive masses, and impart to the liquids with 
which they are mixed a consistency reminding of paste. 
This consistency has the mixed advantages of solidity, or 
at least cohesion, and quick divisibility by dilution. The 
material which causes the viscosity or cohesion of the par- 
ticles of what is by itself a water-like broth, which gives it 
the physical body, as it is termed, is in culinary language 
called a thickening or binding, or liaison in French, in 
English sometimes called leason. Besides these floury or 
dextrine leasons, there are the leasons made with eggs, also 
applicable to sauces. And here we may add that all these 
varieties of leasons or thickenings are applicable to sauces, 
soups, ragouts, and entrees. 

The addition of broth to roux must be done gradually, in 
small portions, with constant stirring in one direction, so 
that every portion of liquid added is cooled and absorbed 
before the next portion is added. If the broth were added 
to the roux suddenly, the two would not incorporate with 
each other, but remain separate, and the result would be 
the very contrary of the object of the operation, and quite 
irremediable. Egg-bindings also have to be added to the 



HISTORICAL SAUCES 229 

liquids to be bound gradually, and while these liquids are at 
a moderate temperature, such as is unable to curdle yolk 
of egg in a diluted state. 

White or bland sauces should not be disturbed by bitter 
ingredients, such as nutmeg, lemon-peel, or similar sub- 
stances. Suited for them are mild flavours, such as mush- 
rooms, truffles, or other fine edible fungi, crayfish or marine 
Crustacea, oysters, mussels, and the like. White sauces 
bear the addition of yolks, as shown by the allemande, 
Dutch sauce, and English butter sauce. White sauces 
agree with some vegetables, e.g., asparagus, cauliflower, even 
potatoes ; but they are not suited to carrots, beet, sorrel, 
and purslane. Chervil, basilicum, and other herbs of strong 
taste, go better with brown sauces. 

The hro'ion sauces are made with the real roux, pleonas- 
tically called hroioi or red roux. They may be moistened 
with dark coloured glaces or their diluted forms, and the 
aromatic herbs already mentioned may be amalgamated 
with them ; they bear bitter and strong spices, strong- 
tasting roots, fungi of all sorts, acids and vegetables pre- 
served therein, such as pickles. At the same time, these 
additions, and the flavouring with onions and their con- 
geners, must not be exaggerated, as it so often is by, par- 
ticularly, Italian cooks, for this excess makes the sauces 
difficult of digestion. 

Wine should in general not be added to savoury sauces, 
but only to such special ones— e.^., egg-sauces — as are 
characterized thereby. A good egg-flip sauce with wine is 
a suitable addition to puddings and fritters of several kinds. 

Definitions of various Historical Sauces and Sauce-like 
Preparations. 

Historical French sauces are gence and cameline. The 
saucier s of Paris had constituted themselves into a corpora- 
tion long before the reign of Louis XI. They made sauces 



230 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

which the people took home to flavour their ragouts. They 
were distinct from the merchants who sold cooked meat. 
Later on the sauciers were called vinaigriers, or moutar- 
diers, and by a patent of Louis XII. their business was 
in 1514 raised to the rank of metier. In these sta.tutes the 
sauces gence and cameline are mentioned ; the sellers were 
only to sell their own manufactures, and were to produce 
them as follows : Gence (to be eaten with roast meat), from 
almonds, wine, ginger, and verjuice ; camelme (to be eaten 
with fried fish), from cinnamon, cloves, paradise grains, 
bread, and vinegar. These sauces were said to have been 
invented by Villiistrissime sieur cle Taillevant, maitre queux 
des wis Charles V. et Charles VI. It is not impossible that 
cameline is a corruption from ca7inellme, from cannelle, cin- 
namon. 

Mustard, moutarde, from mustum, must, the powder of 
sinapis-seed, obtained its name from the employment of 
must in its preparation. 

Cojtrt bouillon is an extract prepared by braising a 
collection of all available stock or bouillon vegetables in 
butter, evaporating down to a concentrated state for colour, 
adding a large volume of wine, and boiling up. This is to 
be used in small portions as an addition to sauces. 

Salt-water used to be a special preparation. Sea-salt 
as formerly much used being sometimes impure, mainly 
from dust, was dissolved in water, boiled and skimmed ; 
French cooks also flavoured it to boil fish therein. 

Verjuice, Fr. verjus, is the expressed juice of unripe 
grapes ; it may be used like lemon-juice, but possesses no 
advantages over it ; it may be useful now and then when 
lemons are not available, during July, August, and Sep- 
tember, in grape-growing countries. 

Zest of lemon is all that part of the peel or rind which 
can be removed by grating the yellow layer of cells filled 
with essential oil. 



BRAISES, MIREPOIX, BLANCS 231 

Derived sauces, or specialized sauces, consist of a fumet, 
or an extract prepared from various fiavouring ingredients, 
and the stock sauce, or general sauce to which the fumet is 
adapted. 

Marinades are considered by some to be mixtures of the 
nature of sauces ; they are used with meat previously to 
cooking, and sometimes in part incorporated with the 
final sauce. 

Braises, Poeles, Mirepoix, Blancs, for Use in Kitchen. 

Under these names £ire known in culinary literature 
and art a series of preparations of which the meaning and 
use was well known to former generations, but which, to 
the great disadvantage of cookery, have become almost 
obsolete. Some of the prescriptions relating to them pro- 
duce a layer of spiced broth underneath a large volume of 
fat, without any mediation by a binding material ; and 
these strata would therefore have to be used up separately. 
Some, e.g., blancs or lohite braises, mainly represent 
flavoured fat, such, e.g., as driiyping, the fat issuing from 
roasting joints, actually is, or spiced fat. Blancs are in- 
dispensable when butter and lard are absent or scarce. 
But mere braises without fat are best replaced by 
white or brown stock, bouillon, consomme, or normal 
broth. 

The French y^ ovd poele signifies primarily a stove, or oven 
(probably a small one), or a frying-pan (Latin, patella), 
also a preserving-pan ; a poelon is an earthenware sauce- 
pan. Poele metaphorically signifies a matter, probably 
something that comes out of, or goes into, an oven or a 
frying-pan, and this definition is fully supported by some 
recipes for poeles, but not by all. The recipe given in 
D.D. 1000, for poele, significantly under the heading of 
sauce, is almost matter for matter our recipe for a stock or 
general sauce ; the only peculiarity is that the poele is to 



232 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

contain three sliced lemons less rind and pips, while our 
own recipes warn cooks not to put any lemon-juice into 
general sauces. 

The word mire'poix (fem.) occurs in D.D. as sauce, a 
la mirepoix, but is not to be found in any ordinary French 
dictionary. It is probably a name proper ; Gouffe defines 
it as an essence of several kinds of meat and vegetables, 
veal and ham two parts each, fat bacon one part, carrots, 
onions, and herbs, two bottles of madeira, and five Htres 
of strong bouillon, salt, and spice. These, then, are the 
elements for the production of a coulis, but the volume of 
wine reminds of the court bouillon. 

Braises (or braizes), in French braises, are understood 
nowadays to be the substance of meat or game which is 
roasted under certain special conditions, with the aid of 
materials specially prepared and mixed, which also bear 
the name of braises. A braisiere is a vessel of metal 
(braising-pan) in which this process is carried out ; it must 
be provided with a cover so close fitting that steam cannot 
escape under a little pressure, and the cover must have a 
raised rampart so as to be able to receive a quantity of 
braise, or live charcoal. In such a receptacle the meat to 
be roasted is, therefore, under conditions different from 
those which prevail on the grill or the spit. It is in an 
atmosphere of steam, and thereby prevented from drying or 
much concentrating its juices ; and it is at the same time 
subjected to radiating heat from above, which acts, though 
milder, like that coming from a fire. Braising thus yields 
a more succulent product, supposing the object of the pro- 
cess to be of limited succulency, and more sauce than the 
roasting process ; but the sauce, or its materials, must be 
added in a prepared state. 

A piece of meat to be braised may be placed with a 
mirepoix and basted with it, or it may be associated with a 
separate set of braising materials, which will not differ in 



ROUX OR THICKENINGS 233 

essence from the mirepoix. There are many recipes in 
cookery for the composition of the materials out of the 
harmonization of which these four sauces result ; but the 
final products are very similar to each other. There is a 
'^oeU or general braise, a luliite poele for poultry, a hlanc or 
ivliite braise for calf's head and ears, or lamb's feet and 
ears, a braise a la Conde, very suitable for game stuffed 
with farce, and a mirei^oix for braising larded fillets, e.g., 
of beef or roebuck. 

Roux or Thickening for Sauces, Soups, and Ragouts. 

We have already shown the meaning of the word * roux ' 
and of its white and broiun modification, and that it consists 
essentially of dextrine, a product of the torrefaction, or over- 
heating, of starch. As flour is taken to produce a roux, 
and not starch, there are other matters produced, which 
give an agreeable flavour, while starch would not produce 
any flavour, but only tasteless dextrine. The temperature 
at which, in fat, flour is transformed into white roux has 
not been ascertained by a thermometer ; but the point when 
it is sufficiently done is indicated by its becoming more 
liquid than it was when first mixed. If the roux be made 
with butter, this should be melted and skimmed, or ghee 
may be taken at once ; add the flour while stirring, and 
continue heat and stirring until the mixture becomes 
somewhat softer ; then keep it hot in an oven for nearly 
an hour, to let all be thoroughly done, but without letting 
it take colour or get burnt. 

The hvion roux, or dextrine carafnelas, is the thickening 
for broivn or espagnole sauces ; it is the roiix properly 
so called, and is made exactly as the white variety just 
described, but it is left in the oven or frying-pan as much 
longer as may be necessary to cause it to assume a fawn 
or buff colour. When it is well coloured, throw half a 
dozen shallots into it, to arrest the further action of the 



234 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

heat and to impart an agreeable flavour. Then dilute with 
standard broth and use for its purpose. 

A thickening for sauces is described by Gouffe under the 
name of Liaison a VAllemande; this name, as its author 
himself admits, is confusing, the material having no con- 
nection with allemande sauce, but being mere floitr-paste 
made with water, bouillon, or milk, and therefore differing 
greatly from a well-made dextrine thickening, or white 
roux, which not only contains butter, but holds the flour 
in a state of transformation. It is this flour-paste which 
has injured sauces in the estimation of the public, and we 
advise our readers to avoid the liaison a VAllemande and 
the velouU bourgeois produced therewith, and to adopt in 
all cases the flour dextrine thickening above described. 

A thickening of yolk of eggs is applied not only to sauces, 
but also to soups, blanquettes, and fricassees of chicken. For 
the incorporation of such a liaison with a sauce, the latter 
must be withdrawn from the fire, and allowed to cool some- 
what. Then a small portion of the sauce must be mixed 
very gradually with the yolks, and the small addition 
repeated until the liaison is very liquid and well mixed, and 
then only is it returned to the body of the sauce ; the 
latter is then heated with constant stirring to near, but not 
actually to, boiling. 

There is also a more rarely used mode of thickening 
hroion sauces luith blood of fowls or game ; in such a case 
the blood is treated as the yolks are treated in the process 
just described. 

The so-called liaison with butter and with mixtures of 
butter and cream are not true thickenings, but enrichments 
intended mainly for the enhancement of the taste. When 
they are employed with soups, it is mostly done to hide 
their want of savour. Cooks should avoid introducing con- 
cealed forms of fat into dishes needlessly, as they may. 
prejudice physiological nutrition. 



GRAND SAUCES 235 



G-eneral or Stock Sauces, also called Grand Sauces. 

The general sauces, coulis gmeraux, stock sauces, are by 
some French authors also called grand sauces, meaning that 
they are made in bulk, and then modified (travaiUe) for 
particular purposes. The French author Courchamps has 
misapprehended this expression, and believing it to be a 
symbol of the high quality of a sauce, has claimed that a 
certain broivn sauce, which he particularly favours and 
thinks the best of all sauces, should alone be termed grand 
sauce, and that mere espagnole should not be identified with 
it. This proposition hardly requires any discussion, but 
seems condemned by culinary history no less than by 
common practice. We shall see that there are five funda- 
mental sauces, from which a great number of finished sauces 
are derived ; they are, therefore, so to say, mother sauces, 
and in this character have been termed grand sauces. 

The same definition clearly is applicable to the adjective 
grand in connection with the general or grand aspic, as it is 
termed in the French kitchen, namely, a savoury broth- 
jelly which may be further transformed either into stock 
sauces, or into real aspics, or jellies, or added to ragouts, 
fricassees, and soups. It is made in so concentrated a 
form that it might be called essence of aspic, and assume 
the position of a glaise ; it is prepared just like the best 
broths and coulis, with the addition of an ounce of gelatine 
to the pint of solution ; it is generally made clear, and 
clarified with white of egg in the same manner as is 
described above for soups. 

From this general 'aspic a few simple sauces are derived, 
namely, clear tarragon sauce and plain aspic sauce. 

All sauces except Dutch satice having broth as the 
essential basis of their savour, and such broth not differ- 
ing from the standards which we have laid down in con- 
nection with soups, it is not necessary to describe the mode 



236 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



of preparing the broth for sauces again in this place. Let 
the cook bear in mind that the flavours must be adapted to 
each grand sauce ; the brown or espagnole bears the 
strongest flavours and admixture ; vcloute, bechamel, alle- 
mande, and butter sauce require to be mildly flavoured and 
spiced. If these general conditions are remembered, the 
principles of the preparation of the sauces and their 
derivates will be easily understood and applied. 

In what is called the bourgeois kitchen, or, rather, in the 
recipes written for the use of such, the rule that a sauce 
must be savoury loitli meat-extract is strangely forgotten ; 
also the necessity of transforming flour into dextrine is not 
insisted upon, or the process is so imperfectly defined that it 
is only partially attained. More commonly a thickening with 
mere flour is obtained, as in the liaison above stated after 
Gouffe ; this imparts a crude imste taste, the taste which 
characterizes badly-made so-called melted butter, being a 
gruel with a little butter stirred into it. We have studied 
many cookery-books in this particular respect, and have found 
most of them lamentably deficient owing to the want of the 
proper theoretical appreciation of the processes in question. 

The next essential part of the preparation of savoury 
sauces consists in the boiling down of all the extracts, 
including the aspic added to a glace. This produces, as 
we know from the consommes in the last stage, the 
caramels of osmazome, which are the most savoury sub- 
stances attainable. This was so well known to the master 
cooks of the last century that they termed such condensed 
coulis caramels directly, without qualification or adjective. 
The broiun coulis are only fit for broion sauce, hence brown 
sauce is that which can be made the most tasty of all 
sauces ; but for ivhite and bland sauces the coulis must be 
kept as pale as possible ; evaporation, therefore, must not 
be carried to the point of caramelization ; just as the roux 
has been kept white, so the coulis must be kept white. 



BROWN OR ESPAGNOLE SAUCE i^n 

This evaporation to glace diminishes the flavours somewhat, 
but tones the strong ones down more than the others, and 
thus harmonizes the whole of them ; where needed, the 
flavour is re-established by secondary operations, travails, 
and specific additions.^ 

Brown Sauce, or Espagnole. 

We will now work out the details of the production of the 
standard sauces as examples and illustrations of principles, 
beginning with espagnole. 

The Meat Extract and Vegetable Glace. — Into a large stew- 
pan with buttered bottom lay about a pound of lean ham 
cut into slices, and above that an equal quantity of veal 
or beef in slices, and over that two or three wild rabbits 
chopped in pieces. Pour on a sufficient quantity of normal 
hrotli to reach the upper surface of the meat ; add a carrot, 
an onion, a bunch of parsley, a sprig of thyme, a bay-leaf, 
half a dozen green onions, a blade of mace, and some cloves ; 
cover the pan, and let it boil briskly until the broth be 
nearly reduced to a glace ; then draw it on a moderately 
hot plate, and add about a pound of ready i^repared glace or 
caramel of aspic described above. When the whole approaches 
the condition of glace, be careful not to let it be caught by 
the bottom fire, but stir and test it for its concentration. 

Test. — When the point of a table-knife, being immersed 
in it and withdrawn, retains a sufficient amount of the

238 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



sauce by adhesion to allow it to be rolled into a ball by 
turning the knife round its axis, and when this ball after 
cooling can be rolled between the fingers without adhering 
to them, then dilute the extract with standard broth to its 
original volume. Now filter the liquid through a tammy_ 
cloth or stout calico filter into a large basin. 

The Broion Boux. — Have the brown roux ready in a large 
stewpan, pour the brown extract over it, and mix them by 
diligent stirring. Regulate the consistency of the resulting 
sauce by the cautious and gradual addition of normal broth, 
so that after boiling up and subsequent gentle simmering it 
may be ready to have the fat removed from its surface. 

Bemoval of the Fat. — When the butter with which the 
roux was made and other coarser particles have risen to the 
surface, either as a scum or in the form of a membrane, 
skim them off. By this operation the sauce assumes a per- 
fectly smooth appearance, and will make a corresponding 
impression upon the tongue. Add a further pint of standard 
broth, and skim off crudities during about twenty minutes' 
boiling, and then pass the sauce through a tammy or cloth 
into a white basin ; stir it until it be cold, and put it either 
into the water-bath for immediate, or into the larder for 
future, use. 

Finishing the Espagnole so as to ])roduce Espagnole Tra- 
vailUe or Coulis Brun. — Place any required part of the sauce 
into a large stewpan, add a desirable volume of essence of 
mushrooms and a sufficient volume of blond deveau to enable 
the mixture on the application of heat to expel some further 
mechanically suspended matters. Make sure that the liquid 
boil up at first, and then continue merely to simmer ; reduce 
it to the consistency you desire, pass it through a tammy, 
and use it with sautes or as simple sauce. In this operation 
the principal effect is obtained by the addition of the mush- 
room essence, and the subsequent boiling is only necessary 
to expel the water introduced by the generally very dilute 
essence. 



WHITE OR VELOUTE SAUCE 239 

White Sauce, or Velout^. 

Put into a stewpan 1 lb. of sliced lean ham, 1 lb. of veal 
or beef, also sliced, and above that two old hens or partridges 
cut in pieces. Add sufficient standard broth for it to reach 
the upper surface of the meat ; cover the pan, and let the 
contents boil briskly until the liquid is condensed nearly to 
a pale glace ; then draw the pan on to a moderately hot 
part of the hearth ; fill it up again with some normal stock, 
add a carrot, an onion, some cloves, a blade of mace, a faggot 
of parsley, half a dozen green onions, a bay-leaf and a sprig 
of thyme tied together. Boil the mixture once more, skim 
it, and pass it through a tammy or stout cahco filter into a 
large basin. 

The Boux. — Place into a stewpan the ready prepared 
loliite roux, pour the extract over it, and mix both by diligent 
stirring over the fire. 

Bemoval of Fat. — Eegulate the consistency of the sauce 
by the cautious and gradual addition of standard broth, so 
that after boiling up and subsequent gentle simmering it 
may throw up to the surface all the loose fajt and the butter 
with which the roux was made, together with any coarser 
particles or little lumps which coalesce on the surface, either 
as a scum or in the form of a skin. Then the sauce assumes 
that perfectly smooth appearance and impression upon the 
tongue to which it owes the name of velouU. If necessary, 
dilute the sauce a little more, remove crudities from the 
top, and then pass it through a tammy or cloth into a white 
basin, stir it till it is cold, and put it in the larder for future, 
or in the water-bath for immediate, use. 

Finished VelouU Sauce, Veloute Travaillee or Coulis 
Blanc. — In order to finish the stock veloute, add to it con- 
somme of veal or fowls (instead of blond de veau) and white 
essence of mushrooms, as well as the white varieties of all 
other accessories. Avoid the addition of lemon to the stock 
as well as the finished sauces 



240 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Bechamel Sauce. 

This sauce consists of a basis of veloute with an admix- 
ture of cream. According to earlier writers, the sauce h la 
Bechamel derived its name from a Marquis de Bechamel, 
who, they think, was thereby immortalized. According to 
others, however. Bechamel was the name of an inventive 
cook. 

Take of finished veloute sauce the quantity required, and 
add thereto an equal volume of boiling cream. Allow the 
mixture to boil for a few minutes while stirring it inces- 
santly, then pass through a tam.my into a special saucepan, 
and place this into a water-bath to be ready for use when 
called for. 

Many recipes prescribe a further concentration of the 
finished veloute sauce previous to the additions of the cream. 
This indicates the weakness of the broth generally employed 
in the preparation of the stock sauce. When normal broth 
is employed these frequent concentrations become quite 
unnecessary. 

Sauce a la Bechamel by the Direct Process. 

This sauce is made without the pedigree of grand sauce in 
one process ; it also passes in French works under the name 
of Sauce a la Ste. Menehould, and in English books as cream 
sauce. 

Place six parts by w^eight of fresh butter into a stewpan, 
add four parts of sifted flour, some tincture of nutmeg and 
pepper, and a little salt ; knead the whole well together, 
and heat it to produce a dextrine roux ; add a carrot and an 
onion, both sliced, parsley, thyme, and bay-leaf, thirty-two 
parts of standard broth and sixteen parts of cream ; boil the 
mixture for about half an hour, while stirring it, until it be 
of the desired consistency ; then pass through a tammy, and 
keep hot in the water-bath ready for use. 



ALLEMANDE SAUCE 241 



Allemande Sauce, Sauce k TAllemande. 

Add to the required quantity of veloute sauce a little 
essence of mushroom, or some hashed mushrooms, and boil. 
When the mixture is reduced to the volume of the veloute 
taken, and the mushrooms are well cooked, take the mixture 
off the stove and incorporate with it a binding or leason of 
yolk of egg, in the proportion of four yolks to the pint of 
sauce, a little tincture of nutmeg, some cream, butter and 
lemon-juice. Stir sauce and leason over the fire until the 
mixture is bound, without letting it boil ; pass through a 
tammy into a saucepan, and keep in the water-bath ready 
for use. 

This sauce is the foundation of many others, especially 
fish sauces. Some French chefs omit the leason of yolks ; 
but then the specificity is taken away, and the sauce 
relapses into the state of veloute. Let the reader remember 
that bechamel is veloute plus cream ; allemande is bechamel 
plus yolk ; or if less cream be taken, then allemande is 
veloute plus yolk and some cream. These modifications 
have their different spheres of application, and should be 
carefully preserved."^ 

* The name allemande, in connection with sauce, is applied by earlier 
writers, e.g.^ La Chapelle, to a green, acidulous sauce of a compound 
nature, to be eaten with roast lamb {loc. cit., vol. v., p. 35). In the work of 
this author the names of veloute and bechamel do not occur ; but the 
name of the former is White Sauce a VEpoulette {ib., p. 37). The only 
equivalent of bechamel is Sauce a la Creme j^oiir Poissons {ib., p. 33), 
which does not contain meat extract, but anchovies. The Sauce d UEs- 
pagnoUe is typically described (ib., p. 27). In 'Dons de Comus,' how- 
ever, bechamel occurs as passde, and as a Vivoire, which La Chapelle 
also describes, though not under the name of bechamel. The Bechamel 
passee of 'Dons de Comus' has no leason, and is, in fact, merely a hot 
mixture of cream and butter, flavoured with herbs and spices ; while the 
bechamel so called is a roux, flavoured with herbs and spices, to which 
cream is added. Neither of these sauces contains extract of meat ; but 
the Sauce a Vivoire (vol. i., p. 38), called bechamel only in the index 
(p. 473), is our regular veloute rich in broth by white braise, and contains 
no cream. Sauce a V Allemande of ' Dons de Comus ' is a blonde de veau 
flavoured with cheese and vinegar. These data show that while espagnole 
is the oldest generally accepted name for brown savoury sauce, bechamel

242 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Butter Sauce (popularly termed Melted Butter), Sauce 
Beurr^e a I'Anglaise, Sauce Blanche. 

This sauce, which serves as the basis of many English 
sauces, requires great care in its preparation, and is very 
agreeable and useful. Put 4 oz. of butter into a stewpan, 
add thereto some tincture of nutmeg and pepper, and 4 oz. 
of sifted flour ; knead the whole well together over the fire, 
and when it has become somewhat more fluid without 
increase in colour, moisten with a pint of warm water, or, 
better, standard broth ; stir the sauce on the fire until it 
boils, and after having kept it boiling for a few minutes, 
withdraw it from the fire, and mix with it \\ lb. of fresh 
butter, added in small pieces with constant stirring. In 
case the sauce should throw up the butter in an oily form, 
add a tablespoonful of cold water, and continue stirring. 
Add salt, then pass the sauce through a tammy into a large 
saucepan, and keep it in the water-bath. 

If it is to be acidulous, add the juice of half a lemon, or a 
little vinegar, just before serving it, but never earlier ; never 
let it boil, or even stand long, after the acid has been in- 
corporated. 

When the sauce is incautiously exposed to a high 
temperature for any length of time, it is apt to become 
decomposed by the butter collecting on the surface as an 
oil ; this can be counteracted by the addition of a little cold 
water in winter, or a small piece of clear ice in summer, 
and working the sauce briskly with a spoon ; it will then 
soon assume its original smoothness. 

As the quantity of butter incorporated in the foregoing 
sauce will be altogether 30 oz., and as some may object to 
it on account of its richness, it is necessary to know that 

became known in wider circles only towards the middle of last century, 
and velonte only towaids its end ; for neither 'Dons de Comus ' nor La 
Ch;ipelle has the term ' veloute.' 



DUTCH SAUCE 243 



the minimum of butter to be stirred into the first boiled 
sauce is 8 oz. ; this would yield a sauce with only 12 oz. of 
butter incorporated. Observe that this is three times the 
weight of the flour employed. These latter proportions are 
observed in the preparation of the white sauce of the French 
kitchen. 

JVliite Sauce, or Sauce Blanche, for Four Persons. — Stir in 
a casserole of the capacity of a litre 30 grm. of butter and 
30 grm. of flour over the fire, until the mixture, at first stiff, 
becomes more liquid ; add tincture of pepper, or pepper 
and salt, and then 2| decilitres of warm water or standard 
broth ; stir over the fire until the mixture boils, then with- 
draw it, and add 60 grm. of butter in small pieces, while 
constantly stirring. Its consistency ought to be such that 
it covers the convex back of the spoon with a layer two 
millimetres in thickness. If it is too thick, it must 
be diluted with water or broth ; if it is too liquid, it 
must be thickened, either by boiling before the final butter 
is stirred in, or by the addition of a new quantity of roux, 
say one-third of the quantity originally produced. 

For the production of these sauces, the English as well as 
the French variation, both the butter and flour must be of 
the best quality. If the rules given above be carefully 
observed, the preparation of melted butter will always be 
successful, and melted butter will triumph over the dis- 
repute into which bad cooks, by their water-gruel products, 
have brought it. 

Dutch Sauce, Sauce HoUandaise. 
Dutch sauce is another example of the manner in which 
the most skilful inventions are spoiled by incompetent 
executants. The principle of its composition is that it 
shall not contain any other ingredient besides yolk of egg 
and butter, and yet many recipes of even accomplished 
cooks prescribe the addition of at least white sauce or

veloute, or of flour or starch. These latter sauces contain- 
ing farinaceous additions should be termed comijound, and 
placed in the position of derivates. Dutch sauce then 
maintains its character as an original or fundamental 
sauce, and its position as the best of pale-coloured sauces. 
As melted butter, or English butter sauce, is an emulsion of 
butter with a watery solution of dextrine produced by heat- 
ing a mixture of butter and flour, so Dutch sauce is an 
emulsion of butter with (a watery solution of) yolk of egg. 
It is, therefore, not a savoury sauce, but perfectly bland, 
deriving a slight acidulous taste from a little vinegar, with 
the introduction of which its preparation begins. 

Mode of i^reparing Dutch Sauce for Four Persons. — 
Put into a saucepan of the capacity of a litre 2 table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, 5 grm. of salt, and 3 grm. of white 
pepper, or its equivalent in the form of tincture ; boil this 
down to a dessertspoonful, withdraw the casserole from 
the fire, add 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water and 2 yolks 
free from white and capsule-strings ; place again on the 
fire, and keep stirring the mixture ; as soon as the yolks 
begin to set, remove the pan from the fire, add 20 grm. of 
butter, and stir until they be fused. Place again on the 
fire, and add a second 20 grm. of butter ; in this way you 
proceed until you have incorporated with the original yolks 
six times 20 grm., i.e., 120 grm. in all, of butter. Never add 
a new quantity of butter before the 8jmount previously 
added is fused and emulged. After the introduction of 
the third portion of butter, put a tablespoonful of water 
into the pan in order to prevent the curdling or turning of 
the sauce. When all butter has been introduced, put 
another tablespoonful of water to the sauce, in order that 
it may not be too stiff; if, notwithstanding this addition, 
it should adhere to the back of the spoon in a layer of more 
than three lines in thickness, then add another table- 
spoonful of cold water. Salt and spice the sauce. 



CLASSIFICA TION OF SA UCES 245 

As regards the preliminary reduction by boiling of the 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, we believe this to have the 
effect only of 'extracting the pepper ; upon this hypothesis 
it would be sufficient to begin the operation with a dessert- 
spoonful of vinegar, the tincture of 3 grm. of pepper, and 
5 grm. of salt, and omit the reduction by boiling. 

There are two principal comioound Dutch sauces, one 
containing loliite sauce, or veloute, and another containing 
melted butter, or butter sauce. These sauces"' should not be 
described as Dutch sauce simply, but have their specializing 
adjectives com2)ound and plaint compound affixed. 

Classification of Sauces. 

In the foregoing we have described and accurately de- 
fined five fundamental satices, from which a great number 
of finished and compound sauces are derived ; there are, 
moreover, sauces which have no relation to these stock- 
sauces, but stand on their own originahty and merit, and 
these sauces we term independent sauces. We thus obtain 
a principle for the following classification of sauces : 

Brown Sauces: Espagnole and finished sauces derived 
from it. 

White Sauces : Veloute and finished sauces derived 
from it. 

WJiite Cream Sauces: Bechamel and finished sauces 
derived from it, or of its kind. 

Yellow Sauces, being bechamels with eggs, allemandes, and 
derivates. 

White Butter Sauce, being melted butter and sauces derived 
from it. 

Dutch Sauce, being butter emulged luith yolk of egg, and 



hidependent Sauces and Derivates. 

Cold Sauces, Marinades, and Essences. 

In the following paragraphs we give the definitions of a 



246 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

number of the most important — that is, best known and 
most used, sauces — but abstain from the introduction of 
details, which would involve needless repetition. 

Finished Brown Sauces derived from Espagnole. 

Espagtiole flavoured 10 itli Truffles, or Sauce dla Financiere. 
— This sauce contains only extract of truffles ; while when it 
contains chopped truffles in substance it is termed Pirigueux 
sauce. 

Sauce for Calf's Head, or Sauce en Tortue. — The latter 
name is a mere reminiscence from mock turtle, or tete de 
veau en tortue ; otherwise there is nothing of turtle about it. 

Sauce for Salmis is espagnole flavoured with such extract 
as can be obtained by braising the trimmings of the roasted 
birds, woodcocks or snipes, from which the salmis have been 
cut. 

Sauce for Salmis a VAncienne is like the previous one, 
with some wine and parsley added, therefore ngt specifically 
different. 

Italian Sauce, Sauce Italienne Bousse, is espagnole varied 
and flavoured by shallots, mushrooms, and olive-oil ; the 
latter probably suggested the name. 

Fines Herhes Sauce is espagnole flavoured with mush- 
rooms, shallots, and parsley. 

Piquante Sauce is espagnole specialized by pickles and 
flavoured with shallots. 

Gherkin Sauce is like the preceding sauce, but with pre- 
vaihng sliced gherkins. 

Tomato or Love-ai^jple Sauce. The adjective ' brown ' is 
here a little inappropriate, as the colour is covered by the 
red of the tomatoes. This sauce should be as thick almost 
as a puree. 

Lyons Sauce is espagnole with flaked onions fried in oil. 

Provengale Sauce is espagnole flavoured with oil and 
garlic. 



FINISHED BRO WN SA UCES 247 

Sretortne Sauc6 is characterized by puree of fried onions. 

Burgundian Sauce is flavoured with shallots and red 
Burgundy wine. 

Borclelaise Sauce contains garlic, aromatic herbs, and 
Bordeaux red wine. 

Portuguese Sauce derives its name from having been 
specialized to fillet of beef a la Portugaise ; it is really 
espagnole flavoured with sherry. 

Poivrade or Pepper Sauce is a name applied to a variety 
of sauces of no specific features, but one is like the 
Portuguese flavoured with sherry and fine pepper. Some 
French recipes under the title of poivrade omit the brown 
sauce as well as the sherry. 

Genoise Sauce is flavoured with a general fumet and red 
wine. 

Matelote or Seaman s Sauce is espagnole flavoured with 
vinous fish - broth and mushrooms. Not to be spelled 
matelotte. 

Orange or Bigarade Sauce is characterized by orange juice 
and peel. 

Brown Begency Sauce is flavoured by fumet of eel and herbs. 

Sturgeon Sauce is espagnole flavoured with braise of 
sturgeon, wine, and mushroom essence. 

Neapolitan Sauce is characterized by grated horseradish, 
and a sweet and savoury wine fumet in espagnole. 

Venison Sauce is espagnole with red-currant jelly and some 
wine. 

Sauce Bobert is said to bear the name of its inventor, a 
cook. It has a great reputation in France, perhaps en- 
hanced by the praise of Eabelais, who called it ' la sauce 
tant salubre et necessaire.' It also enjoyed a literary reputa- 
tion, as having given a pseudonymous title to a satirical 
pamphlet, ' La Sauce Eobert,' which was published by an 
historian of the name of Thiers, cure of Champrod, in the 
diocese of Chartres, against the Vicar-General Eobert. It 



248 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

was a little too full-flavoured, and caused some trouble to 
its author. 

Orleans Sauce is a mince of carrots, anchovies, hard-boiled 
eggs, and gherkins with poivrade. 

Devil's Sauce is espagnole flavoured with shallots, vinegar, 
and hot spices. 

Gravy Sauce for Boast Veal is really gravy thickened with 
roux and flavoured with mushrooms. 

Finished White Sauces derived from Velout^. 

Besides bechamel and allemande sauce, there are a 
number of sauces derived from veloute, the specificity of 
which is obtained by the addition of flavours or fumets. 
Some of these are parallels to brown sauces, and bear the 
principal names of these, with the difference only of that 
particular part of the name which indicates that they are 
derived from white sauce. 

Italian Sauce is veloute varied and flavoured by shallots, 
mushrooms, and olive-oil, the latter probably suggesting the 
name. 

Fines Herbes Sauce contains mushrooms, shallots, and 
parsley. 

Pascaline or White Mushroorn Sauce is veloute with 
minced mushrooms. 

UUxelles Sauce is a stiff mince of mushrooms, truffles, 
herbs, and scraped bacon, with egg-yolks and veloute, for 
covering entrees previous to their being crumbed and fried. 
It is named after the Marquis d'Uxelles, perhaps by his 
cook, the celebrated culinary author De la Varenne. It is 
improperly called a sauce. 

Bed Tomato Sauce is veloute with tomatoes. 

Norman Matelote or Seaman^s Sauce, a parallel to the 
brown, contains mushrooms, wine, mussels, and oysters. 

Aromatic Sauce, a la Saint Pardoux, is characterized by 
morels in white sauce, with herbs and liaison of egg-yolks. 



FINISHED WHITE SAUCES 249 

Bussian Sauce is velout6 with liaison of yolks and herbs. 
It is peculiar by complication as well as name, and the 
secondary ingredients are better adapted to a brown sauce, 
e.g., grated horseradish, which becomes coloured on being 
boiled. 

Atelets Sauce, Sauce aux Hdtelets, is now a covering for 
small bits of meat, or small birds or fish, which are strung 
on skewers, so-called hdtelets. The meat thus is in the 
position of kebobs or khubabs. The things to be fried 
are covered by this preparation, falsely called a sauce, then 
breadcrumbed, over the paste, dipped in beaten eggs, and 
again breadcrumbed and fried. Such fritures are termed 
a la Villeroi or a la Daui^ihine. 

Supreme Sauce, Sauce au Supirenie de Volaille, is veloute 
flavoured with mushrooms and consomme of fowls, to be 
eaten with supreme de volaille, i.e., slices of braised breast 
of fowl. This is really the highest development of veloute 
sauce ; it verges towards bechamel and allemande, but does 
not receive any liaison ; however, both these sauces go well 
with the supreme. 

Horseradish Sauce assorts better with espagnole. If to 
be kept as white sauce, do not boil the horseradish long, 
and add much cream. Unites well with boiled beef or 
braised fillet of beef. The Hindostan housekeeper, or his 
ramasamy, will do well to remember that, although horse- 
radish grows well at Ootacamund and at Bangalore, yet the 
root of the moringa, or * drumstick-tree,' provides a good 
substitute for horseradish. 

Moringa-root Sauce (for use in East India). — Treat the 
moringa-root like horseradish. 

Cold Sauce of Moringa-root is the analogue of cold horse- 
radish sauce. Mingle with an ordinary mayonnaise or tartar 
sauce iced. 

Cardinal Sauce is veloute somewhat promiscuously 
flavoured, and coloured red, whence the name. 



250 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Crayfish Sauce is veloute with fumet of crayfish and cray- 
fish tails. To flavour this sauce well, the carapaces of the 
crayfish should be extracted, as for bisque. Colour with 
alhanet-xooi. 

Lobster Sauce is veloute coloured with Armenian bole, or 
lobster coral. 

Gascony Sauce is veloute, with capers, truffles, and a 
leason of yolk.* 

Sauces derived from Bechamel Sauce. 

For the compounding of these sauces either the true 
bechamel, i.e., veloute mixed with an equal volume of cream, 
or the direct bechamel, in which butter is substituted for 
cream, can be employed. 

White Bavigote, veloute flavoured with spiced vinegar and 
Harvey sauce, is made in three modifications, of which the 
second one is by Urbain Dubois, the cosmopolitan chef, and 



* Notes on, and Literary Be/erences to, FinisJied Brown and White > 
— How many brown sauces are mixed with wine can be seen from F. , 28 et 
seq. ; D.D., 989 et seq. Tor Sauce Bordelaiie, F. prescribes red, Gouffe 
white, Bordeaux wine. As a general rule, wine should be avoided in 
savouries, as its flavour is heterogeneous to them. Poivrade, according to 
Gouffe, 98, is to be coloured a sham-brown by caramel. Matelote is treated 
by D.D., 989 ; F., 31 ; Gouffe, 429 ; the latter omits fish court bouillon. 
De Varenne writes matelotte. Voce Brown Begency Sauce, cf. F., 49 ; 
Gouffe, 434, The equivocal use of the names of dishes is demonstrated by 
the sauces passing under the name of Regency, a word started by Careme 
when he was for the first time one of the chefs of George IV. Gouffe's 
Sauce a V Essence de Volaille, diie Begtnce, differs entirely from that of 
F., in this, that its fumet is not made of eel, not even of fish, but of fowl, 
and is therefore much less characteristic ; the wine to be added is not red, 
but ivhite Bordeaux, as in the case of the Sauce Bordelaise, only the es- 
pagnole remains the same. If for this preparation the name of Brovn 
Sauce with Essence of Fowl were adopted, the surname of Begence would 
be as unnecessary as it is meaningless. 

Various sauces, including one called Devil's, may be seen in Gouffe, 434 ; 
F., 16 et seq. ; D,D., 994 et seq. ; most of these sauces are paralleled by 
analogous ragofits. Voce Supreme Sauce, cf. Gouffe, 439, where also see 
a discussion on the different opinions which cooks entertain regard- 
ing this sauce, and two alternative recipes. The Horseradish Sauce of 
Goutfe, 442, is mere cream with horseradish. Voce Moringa Sauce, cf. 
<Wyvern,' 89. 



DERIVED SAUCES 251 

includes a pandemonium of herbs and onions. In genuine 
French parlance ravigote means a sauce made of certain 
aromatic herbs ; it is derived from the verb ravigoter, to 
revive, to regain one's strength. Thus, any sauce made of 
refreshing green j&ne herbs v^^ould be a ravigote. If these 
herbs were pounded and incorporated with butter, the pro- 
duct would be a fourth variation, ravigote butter, and the 
addition of such to other sauces may entitle them to be 
termed compound ravigote sauces. The herbs to be used in 
all ravigotes are chervil, parsley, tarragon, chives, garden 
cress, celery, balm, and, for green ravigote, spinach. Only 
Dubois has onion in his modification, which is, however, 
warm ; while of the others one is cold, and passes with that 
adjective. As it is mayonnaise to which some ravigote has 
been added, it should be termed mayonnaise ravigotee, or 
green mayonnaise. 

Aurora Sauce is bechamel with a leason of egg-yolk. The 
latter should be of the orange colour of black Spanish fowl 
eggs. This sauce has two variations, determined by details 
of no importance. 

Maitre d'Hotel Sauces. 

The surname of li la Maitre d'Hotel is applied to several 
preparations which must be kept distinct. The first is 
Maitre d'Hotel Butter or Gold Maitre dHotel Sauce, which 
consists of butter mixed with parsley, lemon-juice, salt, and 
nutmeg. When this butter is gently warmed, and by 
stirring made to assume the consistency of cream, it becomes 
Maitre d'Hotel Sauce. When the butter is incorporated over 
the fire with an equal weight of bechamel sauce, we obtain 
Compound Maitre dHotel Sauce. When the incorporation 
of the butter is made with velouti, we obtain the Maitre 
dHotel Sauce liee. Made with espagnole it was dedicated 
to Chateaubriand, when the French under his Ministry 
invaded Spain in 1823. 



252 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Sauces of which the Basis is Sauce k rAllemande. 

Green Ba/vigote consists of allemaude to which the green 
extract or puree called ravigote above described has been 
added. It is also called sauce verte. It can be compounded 
with the aid of ravigote butter ; and then is named Allemande 
verte or Allemande au vertijre. 

Venetian Sauce is allemande flavoured with tarragon, to 
which other herbs may be added. 

Polish Sauce is allemande flavoured with horseradish and 
spices. Of this there is a strong and a mild variety distin- 
guished. 

Sauce for Breasts of Game is allemande flavoured with 
the fumet of the game used, mostly partridges or pheasants. 

Parisian Sa2ice is allemande flavoured with truffles and 
tinted by several artifices. It is to be served with entrees 
of game or poultry, and is the special sauce of the Parisian 
ragoiU. 

Sicilian Sauce is allemande with trufiles and mushrooms, 
garlic, aromatic herbs, and spices. 

Sauces derived from Butter Sauce, or Melted Butter. 

Butter Sauce, for cauliflower, broccoli, asparagus, and 
similar vegetables a VAnglaise, resembles bechamel by the 
addition of cream and a little vinegar. 

Anchovied Butter Sauce is melted butter flavoured with 
anchovies or anchovy butter. In the latter case it is anchovy 
butter sauce. 

Plain Lobster Sauce is butter sauce with minced lobster 
flesh. 

Plain Shrimp Sauce is butter sauce with shrimp-tails. 
A variety of this is made with puree of shrimp-tails. 

Fennel Sauce is specialized by fennel. 

Gooseberry Sauce is remarkable by a mystic association. 
In French works it is termed Sauce a VAnglaise aux 



DERIVED SAUCES 253 



groseilles h maquereaux. Most French and many English 
and German works repeat the injunction, which has not yet 
been traced to its origin, that this sauce was to be served 
with plain boiled maquerel ; but they have not explained 
what connection there exists between the fish mackerel and 
the French name for gooseberries, groseilles a maquereaux. 
At present the relation seems only a similarity of sound. 
The recipes given by some authors lead to the preparation 
of a mere puree, or gooseberry fool, which, as such, belongs 
hardly to the sauces, but may be ranged with them like 
apple sauce. But a sweet sour sauce made by addition of 
this puree to butter sauce or veloute, with some essence of 
meat and sugar, may please many palates. 

Parsley Sauce is melted butter flavoured with parboiled 
parsley. 

Plain Bavigote Sauce is melted butter flavoured with 
herbaceous puree or extract and spiced vinegar. 

Butter Sauce ivith minced hard-boiled eggs is a resource 
when herbs are not available ; it is sometimes called egg 
sauce, but the term is not descriptive. 

Mustard Sauce is butter sauce flavoured with mustard. 
It is useful with broiled fresh herrings to mask the peculiar 
flavour of their fat. 

Calmer Sauce is butter sauce with capers, and given specially 
with boiled mutton. 

Sauces analogous to Bechamel prepared by the Direct 
Process. 

^11 these sauces have this in common, that they are based 
upon a roux, maybe with braised roots, herbs, spices, a 
little wine, and the whole expanded by standard broth, veal 
or chicken broth, consomme or water, and the sauce 
flavoured with essences or cream, and pointed with reference 
to the dishes which they are to accompany. 

Cream Sauce for roast neck of veal.

Plain Curry Sauce. 

Flemish Sauce. 

Caper Sauce for broiled salmon and oilier fish. 

Sauces derived from Dutch Sauce. 

Compound Dutch Sauce is a combination of Dutch sauce 
with veloute and some glace. 

Plain Compound Dutch Sauce is mixed with butter sauce 
instead of veloute. 

Various Independent Sauces. 

These sauces are called independent because they are not 
derived from any of the six grand sauces. 

Poor Mans Sauce, the Saiisse au Pauvre Homme of 
La Chapelle, consists of chopped onions, pepper and salt, 
with a little water, thus not belying its name. A richer 
modification he produces by the addition of oil and vinegar ; 
both sauces are to be used cold. 

Other forms of sauce of this name are more or less com- 
plicated brown onion sauce with pickles or herbs. 

Indian Curry Satice is a roux expanded with broth, and 
flavoured with curry-powder. 

White Oyster Sauce is a white sauce to which oysters 
boiled in salt water are added. A yelloio oyster sauce may 
be made with allemande, a hroivn one with espagnole ; but 
these are derived. 

Mussel Sauces are in all respects analogous to oyster 
sauces. 

Claremont Sauce is onion-flavoured butter sauce. The 
onions are removed after frying. 

German Sioeet Sauce is made of puree of cherries and 
pruneaux {Zwetschen), and suitable for braised venison in all 
its forms. 

Compound Cherry Sauce is a mixture of cherry- puree and 
black-currant jelly ; suitable for roast hare or venison. 



INDEPENDENT SA UCES 255 

Bed-Currant Jelly Sauce for venison is made aromatic with 
a fumet of spices prepared with port- wine. It may be served 
liquid or bound with yolks. 

Black -Currant Jelly Sauce for venison is a fruity and 
vinous sauce. Like the previous one, it can be made in 
three modifications. 

Piquant Sauce for roebuck is made of a savoury roux or 
coulis, to which fruit (red currant) jelly and orange-juice are 
added. 

Bread Sauce (Beauvilliers spells Brede sauce) is a flavoured 
milk or cream panada used to lubricate dry game, pheasants 
and partridges. 

Fried-Bread Sauce is a savoury fumet, or coulis, drenching 
fried breadcrumbs, and accompanies small birds, such as 
becfigues, wheatears, ortolans, ruffs and reeves, and 
others. 

Black Butter and Sharp Sauce is a mixture of browned 
butter with highly-flavoured sharp and aromatic thin sauce, 
without liaison. 

Parsley and Butter, or Browned Butter, consists of these 
two ingredients only. The parsley is added towards the 
end of the browning. The process consists of sharp frying, 
and the browning is effected upon the casein dissolved in the 
butter. It can therefore not be produced with ghee (clarified 
butter). 

Butter and Yolk Sauce, or Bound Butter (Beurre lU), is a 
mere variation of Dutch sauce with less butter. 

Some Special Sauces for Special Occasions and Dishes. 

Currant and Baisin Sauce is a coulis to which plumped

vinegar, with yolks and olive-oil, all incorporated over the 
fire. 

Sorrel Sauce is espagnole with which a puree of sorrel is 
incorporated. We think that to load a sauce with a 
voluminous purc^e is rather destructive of the character of 
sauce. 

Gmne-flavoured Sauce is to derive its character from 
game fumets, added to any of the grand or derived sauces. 

Garlic Butter Sauce is suitable for persons living in the 
open air and for prairie cookery. 

Sauce for Salt Codfish, or a la bonne Morue, is a 
bechamel diluted with milk. 

Chicken Sauce is veloute with liaison, standard broth, and 
herbs. The tendency of modern culinary literature to 
effect abbreviations shows itself in the case of this sauce, 
which was formerly always termed a la poulette, but is now 
generally called saiice poulette. 

Bavarian Sauce is composed of vinegar, eggs, and butter, 
flavoured with crayfish butter, a modified Dutch sauce. 

Bound and Thick Maitre cVHotel Sauce is composed of 
veloute and maitre d'hotel butter, with a liaison of yolk.

gherkins, and herbs in espagnole. 

Plush Sauce is veloute with chopped parsley. 

Green Plush Sauce is a more concentrated variation of the 
former. 

Spinach Sauce is veloute with spinach or its extract. 

Mitshroom Puree Sauce contains the puree in veloute. 

Spiced Saffron Sauce, or Sauce Karl a VIndienne, is veloute 
spiced and coloured with saffron. 

Ivory Sauce was the old name for veloute before the latter 
name was invented. It is now veloute diluted with con- 
somme of chicken. 

Green-pea Sauce consists of puree of peas and extract of 
spinach with veloute.

element, flour, yolks, and wine, with spices. Should be 
heated to near boiling, and well whipped. 

Vanilla Sauce is milk and yolks with a liaison of flour, 
flavoured with a piece of cinnamon and a portion of a pod 
of vanilla. 

Cold Sauces. 

Bemoulade or Sharp Sauce, also termed Bemolade or 
Cambridge Sauce, consists of a puree of anchovies, capers, 
parsley, shallots (garlic), with hard-boiled egg-yolks, dressed 
with spices, oil, and vinegar. The recipe is also headed 
Provenccde Sauce by less informed writers. 

Bernoidade a la Provencale contains the puree, but not 
passed through the tammy, and more oil, which with yolk 
is beaten into a mayonnaise. 

Tartare Sauce is a yolk and oil sauce, therefore a mayon- 
naise with vinegar and green herbs ; the vinegar is one-fifth 
of the volume of the oil. Must be" kept in ice during pre- 
paration, or at least very cold. 

Mayonnaise Sauce is an emulsion of yolk and olive- 
oil. Its origin is unknown, its name a corruption of

Magnonaise. This name is the one used by the earliest 
authors who report it. 

Green Mayojuiaise, Mayonnaise Bavigotee, characterized 
by the addition of a ravigote of green herbs. 

Bed or Coral Mayonnaise Sauce owes its colour to either

of the French remoulade, or English sharp sauce, including 
the Cambridge adaptation. 

Mint Sauce is a solution of sugar in dilute vinegar, to 
which chopped mint is added. French cooks boil it. 

Marinades. 

Marinades were originally solutions of sea-salt intended 
to preserve or flavour any description of meat suitable for 
being pickled. These solutions were flavoured and spiced 
in many ways, and in cases in which the preservation of the 
meat was subordinate to its being flavoured, the pickle 
became small in quantity, rose in quality, and was ulti- 
mately incorporated with the braise in which the meat was 
cooked, 



JELLIES, SAVOURY, SWEET, AND COMPOUND 259 

Boiled Savoury Marinade is a sour savoury pickle, boiled 
to destroy hurtful bacteria. 

Cold Aqueous Marinade or Pickle consists of salt-water, 
vinegar, herbs and spices. Useful in places where there is 
much venison, or the master of the house kills his own beef 
and mutton. 

SJiort Marinade is a conventional expression for a mixture 
of oil and vinegar, with spices and herbs, in which certain 
kinds of meat are soaked for some hours before being 
cooked. Such marinades improve hare, and give to mutton 
a likeness to venison. 

Essences. 

Mushroom Catsui^, Ketchup, or Ketcliop, is the juice of 
mushrooms which exudes when they are kept salted in layers 
in a closed vessel for three or four days. 



CHAPTEE XIX. 
JELLIES. SAVOURY, SWEET, AND COMPOUND. 



There are three varieties of jellies, or compounds to which 
we apply that name. The first variety are fruit jellies, 
obtained by mixing fruit juices with sugar, and stirring 
them until they begin to get thick ; by standing they then 
completely gelatinize. This effect is due to the presence in 
the fruit juice of a series of substances which have received 
various names — those of pectin, pectase, and pectose being the 
most accepted. The substances first roughly isolated by 
Braconnot, and by him called pectic acid, on separation, 
were found to be more neutral, like sugar and starch. The 
name is derived from the Greek pectos, curdled or frozen, 
gelatinized. This gelatinization takes place without the 
application of heat, if the juice be of good fruit, in a warm 
year. When the fruit juice is more watery, it must be 



26o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

concentrated by heat, and then stirring is not so essential to 
gelatinization, as it is in the case of cold juice. Some kinds 
of fruit contain the gelatinizing principles in large quantity 
— e.g., quinces and apples, mangoes, and sometimes oranges. 
These principles, which belong to the starch, gum, or sugar 
family, contain no nitrogen, are therefore essentially 
different from the substance which is yielded by animal 
bodies and is called gelatine — when used for mechanical 
purposes, glue. Starch also yields very firm jelly, and is 
used for its production in hlanc-mangers and other similar 
arrangements ; these are, therefore, congeners to the fruit 
jellies, and very much like them in taste and appearance ; 
when they are mixed with a little vegetable acid and some 
sugar {Eahat-Lakoum), they retain a fusibility by heat, but 
the gelatinizing faculty is not strong, and is easily lost 
by fusion and other influences. The latest substance 
which has been acquired for culinary use is the pure and 
cheap agar-agar, prepared in the East Indies from a sea- 
weed. Its gelatinizing power is double that of animal 
gelatine. To prepare it for use, it is allowed to swell in 
cold water like gelatine, is then cut in small pieces, and 
dissolved in the liquid — be it water, wine, broth, or milk — 
which it is intended to gelatinize. 

Some of the purest-tasting gelatine is obtained from the 
swimming bladders of fish {sturgeon), and passes by the name 
of isinglass. It has now become so expensive that only few 
can use it habitually ; and, on the other hand, gelatine from 
hones has become so excellent and cheap that all can use it 
for the most ordinary as well as special purposes. This has 
also replaced the gelatine which was formerly made from 
hartshorn, and from the skin of ])igs. Practically the 
gelatine used in large kitchens was for centuries made of 
calfs feet, and every cook of our days ought to be fully 
acquainted with its preparation from that material, as well 
as with the use of the mercantile preparations C2i\\tdi gelatine. 



JELLIES, SAVOURY, SWEET, A.VD COMPOUND 261 



An ounce of gelatine in a quart of water will make a firm jelly; 
this quantity of the finest glass-like gelatine should cost less 
than twopence ; on the other hand, calf's foot will only 
yield jelly equal in weight to its own absolute weight, or 
2 lb. of calf's foot will yield a quart of jelly, or just as 
much as 1 oz. of gelatine will produce. But now con- 
sider the work and expense required to get that ounce of 
gelatine out of the calf's foot ; you have to purchase it, and 
its price may be Is. 4d. ; you must split it, and for the 
mere purpose of saving space remove the principal bones ; 
you must then parboil it, wash and boil it anew with the 
water which is to be the jelly. A kilogram of calf's foot (or 
2 lb.) is generally put on the fire with 4 J litres (a gallon) 
of water, boiled and skimmed, and kept boiling during 
from four to five hours, to extract as much gelatine as will 
correspond to one thirty-second part of the weight of the 
water which remains after 3^ litres have evaporated, 
namely, 1 litre, or about 31 grm., or nearly 1 oz. We 
will not work out the details of our proof mathematically, 
but they are overwhelming already, to the effect that 
gelatine prepared de novo from calf's foot costs at least 
sixteen times as much as the best gelatine sold in trade ; 
and if it be of equal quality to the latter in all other 
respects, it will certainly be less clear, and have to be 
clarified at further expense, which will greatly increase its 
price. 

The two varieties of jellies, those naturally making them- 
selves from fruit juice under the influence of stirring or 
evaporation, and those produced by the addition to a 
solution of starch, or agar-agar, are made with the aid of 
carbo-hydrates, or substances consisting of carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen only, without any nitrogen ; while the third 
variety of jellies, including the savoury ones, which are not 
ordinarily made with carbo-hydrates, are produced with 
animal gelatine, such as the swimming-bladder of fish, the 



262 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

tendinous, gristly, and skinny parts of the extremities of 
animals (the Italians have in this relation a fancy for the 
legs of kids), and the bony and horny parts of the skeleton ; 
only the bone-like horns of the stag tribe yield gelatine : 
the horns of oxen, sheep, goats, etc., do not yield this sub- 
stance by boiling in water. 

There is a fourth kiad of jelly produced by culinary 
operations, which, however, is not called so, but is termed 
cream, or Bavarian cream, or Bavarian cheese, French 
Bavaroise ; it consists of a gelatine jelly mixed with cream 
as froth, or with a carbo-hydrate jelly and whipped cream, 
and with white of eggs in the state of froth. 

Isinglass was preferred by cooks because it yielded the 
clearest jellies, although, like the other gelatines, it mostly 
required purification (clarification). Of it 60 grm., or 
nearly 2 oz., were required for an ordinary quart jelly, 
which is more -than double the quantity demanded above 
in the case of jelly from gelatine or calf's foot. During 
cold seasons less gelatinizing substance is required. Of 
rasped ha,rtshorn, 1 lb. (or 500 grm.) was required to yield 
by boiling with 3J litres of water during six hours (!) 
1 litre of jelly. Of fresh pig's skin 1 lb. (or 500 grm.) 
had to be boiled for eight hours to yield gelatine which 
would set IJ litres of jelly. Most cookery-books require 
for an ordinary jelly of the volume of 1 litre 80 grm. dry 
gelatine, 1 in 13-5, which we find much exceeding our 
standard proportion of 1 oz. to the quart of liquid = 1 in 32 ; 
or while the cookery-books require 8 per cent, of gelatine 
in a jelly, we require a little more than 3 per cent. (3 "12 
per cent.), say 3J per cent, of gelatine of the best quality. 
Making allowance for the exigencies of seasons and tastes, 
we maintain that jellies must not be too firm, but fuse 
easily in the warmth of the mouth ; over-firm jellies be- 
come quickly repugnant, and are not rarely left on the 
plate by persons of refined taste. 



GELATINIZED OR CHAUDFROID SAUCES 263 

Some cookery-books erroneously consider the gelatinizing 
power of isinglass to be one quarter greater than that of 
gelatine, or 60 grm. of isinglass to be equal to 80 grm. of 
gelatine. Such gelatine must have been very inferior, and 
mixed with glue which had lost its gelatinizing power by 
excessive boiling. The best gelatine is 200 per cent, better 
than the best isinglass. 

Gelatinized or Chaudfroid Sauces. 

We first allude to some preparations which form a 
transition from sauces to jellies, or combine some pro- 
perties of both. What French cooks term a chaudfroid is 
really a white or brown jelly containing some sauce, 
veloute, espagnole, or bechamel incorporated with it ; the 
name thus indicates a mixture, and is as self-contradicting 
as the ingredients are heterogeneous. When this sauce is 
applied to fowl, partridge, or woodcock, the dish also is 
called a chaudfroid of fowl, etc., being really fowl thinly 
covered with jelly, or glaced with this composition. We 
shall call chaudfroid a sauced jelly, or gelatinized sauce 
{compound jelly) ; it is the counterpart of what some again 
improperly call a hot aspic {aspic chaud). Thus, the proper 
place for chaudfroids in our system is between sauces and 
jellies, where we have accordingly placed them. The three 
principal varieties of chaudfroid correspond to the three 
principal sauces mentioned ; other sauces are evidently 
not so suitable for this treatment. 

Citronized Milk Jelly, or Jelly with Curdled Milk. 

This very excellent refreshing and nutritious dish has 
for ingredients 1 quart of milk, 12 oz. of white sugar 
powder, 4 lemons, and 1 oz. of gelatine. When milk, 
sugar, gelatine, and lemon-zest have been boiled, turned out 
into a basin and allowed to cool a little, add the juice of the 
lemons, and continue stirring till the casein is curdled. 



264 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Then put in moulds in cold water and let set. The casein 
rises to the top ; when the jelly is turned out, it occupies 
the base, and the jelly forms the top stratum. 

Aspic, a Jelly witli Essence of Meat. 

How this Greek name for a shield, and also for a 
venomous serpent, came to be applied to a savoury jelly 
is not yet explained. The jelly, if made without any solid 
additions, serves as a sauce ivith cold meat. Such a savoury 
jelly may, indeed, be given with all cold meat at meals. 
It moistens and flavours the morsel at the same time. If 
aspic could be made only according to the recipes of modern 
cookery-books, beginning with calf's feet, etc., the frequent 
use of this preparation would be impracticable. But with 
normal broth, made by dissolving half an ounce of extract of 
meat in a pint of water, flavoured as you please with spices 
and herbs, and half an ounce of German or French gelatine, 
an aspic is made in a short time of a size sufficient to serve 
several persons at several meals. The gelatine to be em- 
ployed must be in thin leaves like paper, quite transparent, 
and dissolve quickly in the broth without previous soaking 
in cold w^ater. Its solution in pure water must be quite 
tasteless. 

A sufficiently concentrated solution of gelatine in water 
sets or congeals at a sufficiently low temperature. In warm 
seasons such congealing does either not take place, or is 
incomplete or tarries, and has then to be promoted by the 
influence of a cold atmosphere, or of cold water or of ice. 
In view of these uncertainties, every cook must test his gela- 
tine as to its gelatinizing faculty some time before he wants 
it for actual use, and has to adapt its quantity to the amount 
of solidity or stiffness which he desires to obtain. The 
process of setting of a decoction of calf's feet, etc., resem- 
bling the process of freezing of water by cold, caused the 
Italians to term the solidifying solution gelatina, the French 



ASPIC JELLY 265 



geUe ; of these words the English jelly and the German 
yallerte are corruptions. Moreover, gelatina was made to 
indicate no longer the finished jelly, but the dry material 
from which it is produced. 

Savoury jelly is not only useful in cold pasties and in the 
combination with cold miOat, but it is also a very excellent 
refreshment for sick or weak persons. It is a tasty and 
easily assimilated refreshment only, and by no means a 
substantial nutriment. The common error, that the con- 
dition of jelly, assumed, e.g., by broth on cooling, in case it 
has been boiled for a long time with gristle, indicates the 
presence of a considerable amount of nutritive matter, must 
be eliminated. A quart of normal jelly contains but an ounce 
or one thirty-second part of its weight of gelatine ; meat 
contains one quarter of its weight of albuminous substance. 
Allowing the elements of flesh and of collagen, the gristle 
out of which jelly is produced, to be of equal nutritive 
oxidizable value, a pound of meat would be eight times 
more nutritious than a pound of well-made culinary jelly. 

Jelhes flavoured with fruit juices and aromatic herbs, sub- 
acidulous, faintly sweet, and well cooled, serve as agreeable, 
easily-digestible refections, by which dinners are agreeably 
prolonged, and the gustatory organs are cooled and amused 
at the same time. Such jellies belong to the ornamental 
and gustatory class of dishes in French termed j;k^s cle gout. 
They may, of course, not contain any meaty flavour, no 
bouillon, no meat extract, no glace. 

It is a moot question whether the name aspic applies to 
the savoury jelly only, or also to the meat which may be 
enclosed in it, such as fillets of fowl, game, or fish, hard 
eggs, mushrooms and truffles. Dumas terms the aspic a 
cold entree, while allowing that the great cooks had ruled 
that there were no cold entrees, which is the same as to say 
that they or their employers would not permit any such on 
their bills of fare. Some are said by Dumas to elect that 



266 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

the aspics should be served with the roasts, while he prefers 
them to follow the roasts. JFor ourselves, we agree with the 
French maitres, who maintain that an aspic has no place at 
a dinner, but belongs strictly to the series of cold dishes to 
be used at suppers, breakfasts, and other cold collations. 
We therefore hold that an asjjz'c cliaud such as is described 
by some authors is a misnomer for a compound gelatiniferous 
sauce, which, like the ancient glace, may serve as base for 
great and small ragouts, but can never take an independent 
place at table. We abstain from giving the recipe for the 
aspic cliaud* firstly, because its execution takes five hours 
at least ; secondly, because its complication mocks Apician 
cookery; thirdly, because the product has to be passed 
twice through a napkin ; and, fourthly, because it is inferior 
withal to ragout sauces produced by direct methods. 

Grand Aspic. 

It is necessary for large establishments, such as hotel 
kitchens, to have at hand a general reserve aspic, to be used 
for the immediate production of special great and little 
aspics. It is called grand for the same reasons that certain 
sauces are called grand, namely, because it represents a 
general base, produced on a large scale, to be divided into 
parts to receive separate specialization from additions 
mainly. 

The aspic, then, has for its basis a savoury coulis, and in 
this respect does not differ from the sauces. Each quart 
requires to contain an ounce of gelatine. The gelatine may 
be made from calfs feet, and this has to be clarified by 
white of egg, or it may be supplied directly as gelinglass, the 
pure form of glass-like gelatine now sold in trade. The 
aspic may be coloured red by beetroot or cochineal, or brown 
by brown gravy or caramel. Its own colour is, however, 
quite acceptable. The spices are best applied as tinctures. 

* C/. ' Dictionnaire General de la Cuisine,' ex D.D., 192. 



JELLIES FLAVOURED WITH WINE 267 



Isinglass also has to be clarified when it is to be used for 
sweet jellies. The most simple mode of doing this is by 
solution and skimming ; if this be not sufficient, the fining 
by white of egg becomes necessary. 

Preparation of Sugar Syrup for Jellies. 

Sugar syrup, even when made from white sugar, is fre- 
quently somewhat turbid, not so much from matters con- 
tained in the sugar as from impurities in the water. Syrups, 
unless made with distilled water, have, therefore, to be 
clarified at a boiling heat, either by mere skimming or by 
means of white of egg ; the boiling heat also sterilizes the 
syrup by destroying bacteria. 

Preparation of Fruit Juices for Jellies. 

Fruit juices have to be boiled and skimmed, and ultimately 
filtered. Filtration may be made through paper or cloth ; it 
may be preceded by agitation with paper-pulp or sand. 
These substances collect the gelatinous pectinous particles, 
which, if not thus fixed, quickly obstruct any filter, and 
allow no more juice to pass. For filtration through paper, 
the best material is the strong white Ehenish filtering-paper 
sold by chemical warehousemen. Sand should be white, 
and well boiled, washed, and levigated ; it must be shaken 
with the juice in a stoppered bottle. This process is effectual 
in treating larger volumes of lemon or orange juice, which 
contains much gelatinous pectose. 

Jellies flavoured with Wine. 

Such jellies can be made with high - flavoured wines, 
sherry, hock, and others, either by adding them to any of 
the standard sweet jellies, or by producing a dilution of the 
wine with water, adding prepared syrup, acidulating with 
lemon-juice, flavouring with tinctures of spices, heating the 
mixture, and dissolving in it a quantity of glassy gelatine 



268 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

amounting to one ounce for every quart of vinous liquid. 
Care should be taken not to make the jellies too strong. 

There is a kind of frothy jelly produced by adding effer- 
vescent wine to an otherwise fully finished jelly mixture 
which is on the point of setting. It is called Jelly ivith 
Chamjmgne. When the wine is stirred in and incorporated, 
the jelly is packed into a mould and kept in ice. Such a 
jelly may be combined with one containing still wine, and 
having a different colour. Thus, we have seen white cham- 
pagne jelly forming the top, and translucent hock jelly form- 
ing the basis, of jellies. 

Orange Jelly, when well made, idealizes the best features 
of the fruit. It embodies the zest, which is otherwise mainly 
wasted ; then it receives vigour and additional zest by some 
added lemon. Both the orange and lemon rind should be 
extracted with alcohol, and the tincture only should be 
added to the juice. Put the juice, say, of ten oranges and 
two lemons in a quart of water, and boil, while skimming, 
after having added 12 oz. of sngar {i.e., 1 oz. of sugar to 
each fruit). In case the boiled and skimmed solution were 
not to run clear through Ehenish filter-paper, it should be 
boiled with the beaten white of one egg, and then filtered. 
Dissolve 2 oz. of gelatine in a quart of water, and add the 
solution to the juicy clean syrup ; add a wineglassful of 
7naraschino, or cognac, or mere alcohol to the product, and 
pour it into moulds. The product should be about 5 lb. of 
jelly. Clarification by albumin diminishes the flavour of 
the jelly ; the tinctures of the zests should therefore be 
added quite at last, with the pointing of liqueur. 

Lemon Jelly is similarly prepared, only ten lemons being 
required for five pints of jelly. 

Mackloine of Oranges is orange jelly mixed with prepared 
sections of oranges. 

Pineapi)le Jelly is more laborious. The pineapple has to 
be rasped unpecled, the pulp to be pressed in a cloth, and 



JELLIES WITH LIQUEURS 269 



further digested for half an hour, and extracted with half a 
pint of water. The juice of two lemons being added, boil, 
skim, and, if necessary, clarify with white of egg ; add water 
to make the solution measure a pint ; dissolve in it an 
ounce of gelatine-glass, add a pint of clarified sugar syrup, a 
pointing of wine or liqueur, and place in moulds. 

'Pomegranate Jelly is in favour in the South. It should 
be coloured with cochineal, as its own colour is too feeble. 
Its taste is not pronounced without the addition of lemon- 
juice ; but it is characteristically astringent, from the con- 
tents of the crushed pips or seeds. 

Cranherry Jelly is highly flavoured, but only feebly 
coloured, and requires some cochineal. 

GurraJit and Baspberry Jelly is an excellent combination, 
the currants supplying acidity, the raspberries flavour. 

Straivberry Jelly requires either lemon or red-currant 
juice for acidulation. It gives a nice macedoine with small 
ripe or large cut-up strawberries. 

Cherry Jelly combines the juice of the Kentish pie cherries 
or Vistula sour cherries with that of red currants. Raise 
its colour by cochineal. 

Mac^doines of Apricots, Peaches, and Apples. 

These macedoiues are fruit jellies, with portions of fruit 
deposited in their substance. The fruit is often added raw, 
but on the whole it is advisable to use it stewed in sugar 
syrup, with preservation of shape. Plums, strawberries, 
raspberries, mulberries, white and black currants, cherries, 
grapes, may be employed. The result, in our opinion, is 
more pleasing to the eye than sympathetic to the sense of 
gustation. 

Jellies with Liqueurs. 

A pint of a spirituous jelly should not contain mpre 
than 2 oz. of any liqueur. Maraschiuo or Alsatian 



270 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Kirschenwasser, cognac brandy, cura9oa, Dantzic gold- 
water, cedrally (cedrela), rum-punch, whisky, or gin, may 
be used. 

Variegated Jellies are characterized either by different 
colours, in layers, or different flavours, all interspersed with 
shredded pistacio-nuts. In this way residual broken jellies 
may receive a new form. 

Streaked Jellies, or GeUes imnachees, became fashionable 
during the French Eevolution of 1789. Breccia Jellies are 
made by placing lumps of different jellies in a mould, and 
filling the interspaces with liquid differently-coloured jelly. 
When set the product resembles the breccia of geologists. 

Whisked or Frothy Jellies, also called Eussian, for no 
assigned reason, can be made with any jelly while in a state 
of fusion. When frothy it must be made to set by the 
external application of cold. The champagne jelly above 
described is frothy by the evolution of carbonic acid gas. 
The whisking process influences the appearance, but hardly 
the taste of the jelly. 

Compoiind Fruit Froths, or MacMoine PurSe Jellies, are 
mixtures of jelly and compote. The puree of fruit is incor- 
porated with the jelly. Some of these compound fruit- 
puree jellies have received the name of ixiin, probably 
intended to indicate the rounded-off body, and translatable 
by loaf. Thus, a jelly with puree of pineapple is named 
Pain cV Ananas ; it is coloured with (60 grm.) a preparation 
of cochineal in gelatine, which the French call grenetine. 
Another, with puree of strawberries, is Pain de Fraises, also 
requiring 40 grm. of grenetine. 

The jellies just mentioned form a transition to the com- 
pomid creams, or Bavaroises, or Bavarian cheeses, which 
derive their consistency from gelatine, their richness from 
cream, and their flavour from extract of fruit, and owing 
to' their triple basis are amongst the finest products of 
culinary art. 



BLANC-MANGER 271 



Blanc-Manger and its Transformations. 

It appears from a letter of Madame de Maintenon that 
Dr. Fagon prescribed under the name of hlanc-manger 
an aliment to be used by patients affected with in- 
flammatory disorders. On following up the matter his- 
torically, we found the following old recij^e for hlanc-manger : 
Pound 125 grm. of blanched almonds with a little water, 
and add a litre of consomme made without vegetables and 
free from fat ; in the place of the vegetables put into the 
bouillon with which you make consomm6 two cloves, a 
stick of cinnamon, and some salt ; when the bouillon is 
well mixed with the almonds, add 60 grm. of the white 
flesh of roast fowl, minced and pounded, free from skin, 
tendons, and bone ; or roast veal, or a piece of breadcrumb. 
When all is well mixed, pass through the tammy, add 
to the pur^e the juice of an orange and 125 grm. of 
sugar, and place on a lively fire until the composition 
has become thickened. 

This, then, is really a soup of almonds and supreme de 
volaille in consomme ; how its name blanc-manger came to 
be confined to a white jelly is not ascertained ; but the 
limitation is of relatively recent origin, perhaps not older 
than the beginning of the present century. 

A hlanc-manger is nowadays a jelly made with calf's foot, 
or gelatine, and milk of almonds. There are several 
modifications, marked by greater or lesser concentration 
of the ingredients. A French recipe even goes so far as 
to destroy the white colour of the jelly by an addition of 
grenetine, being gelatine coloured red with alkanet-root or 
cochineal A recipe for a fried hlanc-manger leads to a 
pudding-hke mixture of rice-flour, cream, marchpanes, 
macaroons, and eggs, lemon-zest, and salt, which is to be 
fried in butter or lard. But this is a misapplication of the 
name altogether, and should be discontinued. 



272 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Many modern recipes for hlanc-mancier are content with 
a mixture of milk and starch, which, when boiled and 
cooled, becomes an opaque jelly, a mere flummery. This 
may be eaten with a sweet custard sauce. Others, again, 
destroy the character of the dish by adding chocolate, and 
term it cJiocolate hlanc-manger. These are barbarisms from 
w^hich every appreciator of good cookery must turn away. 

Use of Perfumes and Ethers in Jellies. 

Jellies should not be impregnated with mere ])erfumes, 
such as violets, for they will be as disappointing as the 
sugared violets which became a fashion under the Second 
Empire in France. Artificial ethers resembling fruit- 
essences should also be avoided. 

Fruit Jams which in England are called Cheese. 
The prototype of these confections is the jam made 
originally of quinces and honey, now of quinces and 
sugar. From the Spanish name of the quince, marmela, 
this jam was called marmelada. From this the name was 
transferred to orange jam, which many persist in affectedly 
calling orange marmelade. While orange jam has little 
resemblance to true marmelade as regards consistency, 
there are other kinds of fruit the pulp of which furnishes 
excellent cheese — particularly of the plum tribe, apricots, 
and above all damsons. In these small plums the pectin 
bodies which produce the dense gelatinizing principle are 
most successfully developed. The more juicy kinds of 
fruit used in domestic cookery, such as currants and 
raspberries, contain enough of these pectin bodies to 
yield jellies, but never enough to produce so dense a con- 
fection as is implied by the metaphoric term of cheese. 
Their juice requires an addition of some gelatinizing 
principle, which might appropriately be agar-agar, but, 
under the conditions of rarity to which this cheap and 



DRESSED CREAM AND COMPOUND CREAMS 273 

plentiful material is condemned by the indifference of 
traders, must needs be gelatine. 

A'pricot cheese, by the French termed fromarjc cle, or d la, 
Cliantilly, is the next best after that of quinces and damsons ; 
the name is derived from a locality where apricots were 
reared of high quality and in abundance. 



CHAPTER XX. 
DRESSED CREAM AND COMPOUND CREAMS. 

Charlottes, Starch Jellies, or Flummeries, Cold Puddings. 

The plain and simple preparations of cream from cow's 
milk depend for their success mainly upon the quality of 
the material. This should be very thick and viscid, so-called 
double cream, flowing but slowly in a thick wave with a 
round, bulging front, and should be sweet. Sour cream 
may be used, even be preferable, for sundry purposes, but 
it should be applied only when it is expressly indicated. If 
the cream be not sufficiently viscid for all purposes, it may 
be improved by the addition of some gum arable (gum 
acacicB) dissolved in a minimuaa of orange -flower- water ; 
this mucilage will increase its viscosity. 

Cream in substance is not very wholesome, and there- 
fore, whenever it has not to be diluted otherwise, it is 
beaten into a froth, a condition in which its taste is pro- 
nounced while its bulk is not excessive. This ivhlpped 
cream, or cream-snow, creme fouettce d la imysanne, is 
tasty, and can be made ornamental as well. It may be 
flavoured in several ways, that by vanilla being preferred ; 
maraschino or other liqueurs are next in favour. An 
addition of grated brown bread gives a vigorous contrast, 

18 



274 '^^^I^ SPIRIT OF COOKERS 

which can be heightened by a garnish of sponge-cakes, 
macaroons, and ratafias. This mixture was at one time 
esteemed in the frozen state, as so-called ice. 

Whijij^ed Cream witli Fruit is highly esteemed in many 
forms ; the fruit as puree is mixed with one-quarter of its 
weight of powdered sugar, and to this mixture an equal 
volume of cream.-froth is added and well incorporated with 
it. In case the fruit puree be too juicy to remain coalescent, 
it should be placed on slices of sponge-cake, or on lady's 
fingers, which will absorb the liquid part, and keep the 
body of the cream in a solid state. The red juices require 
some cochineal to heighten their colour. 

Cream Jellies, or Preparations of Cream ivitli Jelly, are 
very characteristic dishes called Bavaroises, or Bavarian 
cheese. A milk or emulsion of almonds, or nuts, is mixed 
with boiling cream suitably sweetened ; to this a con- 
centrated solution of gelatine is added (in the proportion 
of 1 oz. to the quart), the whole passed through a tammy, 
and put in moulds to set. Pistachios and spinach make 
the Bavaroise green. Such cream jellies may also be 
flavoured by liqueurs, maraschino, or essence of orange, 
lemon, orange-flower, vanilla, roast and bitter almonds, 
etc. Egg-yolks may also be added, or a liquid custard 
may be given as a sauce with the Bavaroise. 

Cream Jelly of Punch, as French cooks term it, is 
flavoured with Jamaica rum. 

Cream Jellies tvith Fruit are analogous to the prepara- 
tions of whipped cream with fruit already defined. Juicy 
fruit has to be concentrated. 

Compound Custard Jellies contain eggs and a gelatinizing 
body, but no cream. Indeed, the custard is made to take 
the place of the cream, and from this and similar substitu- 
tions some German cooks call a mere custard a * cream.' 
The physical similarity to whipped cream is effected by the 
addition of whipped white of egg. These preparations are 



DRESSED CREAMS-BAVAROISES 275 

put forth in books retailing cheap cookery and certain shops 
as creams, a name to which they are not entitled. We have 
therefore given them their proper defining name. 

A Custard Jellij loith Wine and Egg-froth bears the 
French appellation creme bachique ; the wine may be 
hock, champagne, madeira, or malaga. The amount of 
gelatine in all these jellies is kept at 6h per cent., dry, or 
about 1 oz. to the pint, of the finished jelly, for they have 
to maintain a spongy, frothy condition ; but the meat or 
sweet jellies require but f oz. to the pint. 

Custard Jelly with Wine and Orange-juice is a good com- 
bination. 

Compound Custard Jellies ivith Cream and Custard Cream 
Jellies are mixtures of cream with custard and jelly, the 
latter added to give it consistence and shape, flavoured with 
materials similar to those which are employed in plain 
creams, custards, and jellies. When the cream is added 
to these compounds in the whipped state, they are by 
French cooks termed en mousse. This should be * spongy.' 

Such custard cream jellies may be flavoured with vanilla, 
or orange-flower, or madeira wine and vanilla, or maraschino, 
or coffee. An old recipe"^ prescribes curdling of the cream 
by the agency of (rennet) ferment obtained from fowl's 
stomachs or gizzards. This recipe has been so deteriorated 
by copyists that, on the false assumption of the gizzards 
being introduced to produce gelatine, the real gelatine was 
omitted, and the eggs were omitted probably from parsimony ; 
such a mutilated formula must necessarily produce a failure. 
Other flavours and additions are chocolate^ burnt sugar, or 
caramel (resembling creme brulee), macaroons, and ratafia. 
A jelly flavoured with the latter also passes by the name of 
Itcdian cream, or Bavaroise with ratafici.

276 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Cold Charlottes or Pudding-like Preparations in which any of 
the Five Varieties of Cream may be employed. 

The liot Charlottes are real puddings, and contain no 
cream, e.g., those of apples or apples and brown bread ; but 
the cold varieties belong to this place in the system, as they 
principally consist of comijound creams. There is no history 
to the name, and they are defined by French authors as 
Plats d' entremets d la creme et aux fruits. 

Compound Cream Charlottes, commonly called Charlotte 
Biisse, or Charlotte a la Creme dite a la Busse, or a la Biclielicu, 
is an artistic outer case of sponge-cake filled with any of 
the compound creams above alluded to. When different 
jellies are employed, arranged in compartments, the 
Charlotte a la Brunoy is produced. When the case is 
constructed of fresh strawberries, agglutinated by liquid 
jelly, a macedoine-like charlotte ensues, called in French 
works Celestine Strawherrij Cream. When the case is made 
of agglutinated almonds, supported by two layers of com- 
pound creams, and a custard cream jelly in the centre, a 
so-called Panach^e Cream, or Cream a Surprise, results. 

Starch Jellies or Flummeries. 

Flummery signifies an acid jelly made from the husks of 
oats, the Scotch sowers ; the word derived from the Welsh 
Ihjmry, or llymrig, harsh, raw, or llym, sharp, severe, has 
also acquired a metaphorical meaning equivalent to insipid 
compliment. That the husks of oats should produce an 
acid by fermentation is analogous to the result of the 
fermentation of bran, which produces acids of the fatty 
acid series, particularly proprionic, useful in the preparation 
of morocco, kid, and wash leather. But the origin of the 
jelly, or any jelly, from husks is less easy to explain. We 
have nowhere met with any description of the manner in 
which this original Scotch acid jelly might be produced. 



STARCH JELLIES OR FLUMMERIES 277 

However, flummery as now used in culinary language 
signifies a preparation the principal constituent of which is 
a kind of flour or starch (flour of wheat, or grits, of rice or 
rough-ground rice, also as grits, buckwheat, millet, sago, or 
starch of potatoes, rice, etc.), made soluble or expanded in 
milk, a fruit juice sweetened with sugar, flavoured with 
aromatics or liqueurs, mixed with the froth of whipped 
albumin, and allowed to set into a jelly in a suitable mould. 
A flummery is sent to table with a tasty sauce, such as 
liquid custard with liqueur, or cold sauce of raspberries, 
currants, or cherries, or cream or milk sauce with flavour 
of almonds or vanilla, or wine sauce. In German culinary 
literature the dish figures as flammeri, which is further 
corrupted to flambri. It is not noticed at all in many 
English cookery-books, and the French also as a rule ignore 
it. One of the latter* has a dish which he terms Plombieres, 
without any explanation. This might be an attempt at an 
approximative reproduction of the word ' flummery ' as 
spoken. The French dish which bears this heavy name is 
a cream custard, flavoured with almonds and set by heat 
below boiling, mixed with whipped cream and frozen in ice. 
Being thus destitute of starch and flour of any kind it does 
not come under our definition of flummery. 

A Flummery of Bice-grits and Fruit Juice, so-called 
Piotke Griitze {Bed Grits), of Baltic Germany, originally 
made with buckwheat, now of rice or wheat grits, to be 
eaten with cream or custard, is popular in Northern Europe. 
Flummeries of wheat-grits, ot ^lotato and tvheat starch, boiled 
with milk, flavoured with liqueur, e.g., maraschino, are 
eaten with cold fruit sauce or liquid custards. Many varia- 
tions of flummeries are described, which can be produced 
by the observance of the following 2)riuciples : 

Any flour, grits or starch may be used to produce the 
initial paste. 

* Of. Gouffe, loc. cit., p. 770. 



278 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Of grits (of rice or wheat) three parts will produce the 
same solidity of the flummery as two parts of starch. 

Of buckwheat a greater proportion is required than of 
grits, and of millet a greater one than of buckwheat. 
These latter cereals will be less used where rice and wheat 
are freely accessible, but many an opulent man on the 
Baltic would think his red grits imperfect if it were not 
made of buckwheat. 

Sago would give an imperfect flummery unless it were 
very much boiled, or mixed from the beginning with some 
binding starch. The same observation apphes to tajnoca. 

The liquid by means of which the floury base may be 
swelled into the colloid body may be ^nilh, or even cream, 
or fruit juice. A milk flummery may be harmonized by an 
egg sauce, but is best relished with a contrasting fruit juice 
sauce, while inversely a fruit- juice flummery is best relished 
with a jnilk custard or cream sauce, or with cream only. 
The harmonious or contrasting flavouring of flummery and 
sauce must be attended to. 

Cold Puddings. 

In some cookery-books a number of dishes are placed 
under the heading of flummery which, although they may 
have some features in common with it, are nevertheless 
peculiar ; they are sometimes treated of under the name of 
Cold Siceet Dishes. They are in reality Cold Puddings, and 
under this name we propose to consider them. They are 
not merely ordinary puddings which have become cold, 
but such as require exposure to a low temperature before 
they acquire the consistency or quality which entitles them 
to be called puddings. 

Cold Milk Bice is the most popular of these dishes, as a 
French novelist testified, who found it, in conjunction with 
prunes, on every hotel table in Switzerland. It may be 
mixed in strata with fruit pulp, such as apples, or cheese 



COLD PUDDINGS 279 



of apricots, damsons, and currants plumped in water. A 
punch or arac sauce or a custard sauce may suitably 
accompany it. 

Gold Wine Bice is boiled rice immersed in a syrup made 
of two parts of sugar and one part of w^hite wine ; 1 lb. 
of dry rice to 1 lb. of sugar and half a pint of wine is a good 
proportion. The flavours may be various — zest of lemon, 
lemon-juice, or others employed in jellies. Dressed slices 
of oranges make the dish very refreshing. 

Poppy-ieed Pudding is made by triturating the poppy- 
seed with a little cream or milk, so as to obtain a paste, to 
be flavoured with bitter almonds, sugar, cinnamon, rose- 
water, or orange-flower-water. This paste is spread over a 
layer of bread laid like the case of a charlotte in a pudding 
form, and soaked in milk ; alternate with layers of poppy- 
seed paste and panada, and at last cover with panada ; 
ornament with sugar and cinnamon. This pudding is to be 
heated in a water-bath, to set on standing, and after cooling 
to be turned out. 

A Compound Poppjj-seed Pudding contains, besides the 
paste, macaroons, yolks of eggs, currants, and whipped 
white of egg ; to be baked in a water-bath in a moderately 
hot oven, turned out on a plate, and be sent to table cold, 
with a custard sauce. 

Dishes with a Constituent Basis of White of Egg Froth. 

Snoiv Milk. — The German cooks call the froth of white 
of egg snow. The froth used in the dish is sweetened and 
scalded in milk, so as to become set. It then becomes the 
solid part of a refection of which the liquid part is milk, or 
milk and egg-yolk, i.e., liquid custard. This dish, to be 
eaten with a spoon, is a great refreshment at any time of 
the year, but particularly in summer-time, when well cooled. 
It is also a very excellent dish for patients and invalids 
suffering from affections of the throat, or the effects of opera- 



28o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

tions in the mouth and throat ; those who are too weak to 
chew or pulp with their tongue the snow, can yet drink the 
custard in which it was scalded. 

An Austrian variation is Snow-Nockeln — as indicated by 
the name Nockeln, the southern equivalent for the Bavarian 
Knodel, the Suabian Knopfle, High German Klosse. The 
custard receives an addition of gelatine, and is set and 
moulded, the balls being immersed in the custard so as to 
form a breccia.

CULINARY FATS AND THE PROCESS OF FRYING. 

Culinary Fats, Butter and other Animal Fats, Vegetable 

Fats. 

The quality of butter depends to a large extent upon the 
breed of cows, the nature of their food, and its quality 
even as determined by the place where it is grown, and the 
mode of its preparation. The influence of the food was 
expressed by the rustic writers of Eome by the saying : 
' Pabuli sapor apparet in lacte.' Of the injurious flavours 
of milk derived from food containing plants of the wild 
garlic tribe and other odorous vegetables, like cabbage, 
turnips, etc., flavoured by sulphuretted essential oil, only 
small portions remain with the butter, and these can be 
made to volatilize by the process of fusion. The most useful 
varieties of butter next to English are Irish, Dutch, Holstein, 
Swiss, Norman, and from the Channel Islands. Australian 
also has lately put in an appearance in a frozen condition. 
Most butter is now made from sweet cream, but some is 
also produced from cream which has been allowed to collect 
pn soured milk. Wherever the latter process is carried on 



CULINARY FATS AND THE PROCESS OF FRYING 281 

in cold cellars, it yields a very good butter, but on the large 
scale of extensive farms it is impracticable. 

Butter which has not a pure taste can be improved by 
washing first with salt waiter, then with some milk, and 
ultimately with pure water. . It can be preserved by salting, 
but not thereby protected absolutely from deterioration. 
The best mode of preserving butter for culinary processes is 
clarification by heat. 

Clarified butter, Indian Ghee, Schmalz of the Germans, is 
produced by heating butter until all froth and deposit of 
casein has subsided and the liquid is perfectly clear and 
free from water. The necessary degree of heat is ascertained 
by immersion of a piece of breadcrumb, which should float 
under slight effervescence, and become slightly brown. 
Such butter will keep good indefinitely, and is the best and 
most reliable form for all culinary purposes. French cooks 
use butter for the frit ures maigres, and aver that it requires 
more care than lard or suet, because it accepts heat quicker, 
and has therefore to be heated on a less active fire. 

In countries in which butter is rare — as in Italy, the 
South of France, Spain, and Portugal — Jiog's lard or beef 
suet takes the place of butter for many culinary purposes 
for which in our northern countries butter exclusively is 
used. But this does not exclude the use of hog's lard for 
frying in countries where butter is plentiful, as lard, on the 
whole, is considerably cheaper than butter. Lard is dis- 
liked by some cooks, as it is said to leave a disagreeable 
layer of fat on the objects fried. 

Mahometans and Jews, who do not use lard, find, in 
countries where butter is rare, an occasional substitute for 
it in goose fat. This, when clarified, is of excellent taste, 
but it can be obtained only in limited quantities, even from 
lake districts — e.g., that of North Germany, w^here geese are 
reared in great numbers. 
Por the nations round the Mediterranean, olive-oil has, 



282 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



since prehistoric times, been the principal culinary fat, as 
well as fat-food ; it was burned in their lamps, and illumi- 
nated the shrines of their saints, as it does those of the 
saints of the Eussians of the present day. The northern 
nations have a prejudice against the use of olive-oil in 
cooking, which is mainly due to the fact that it was some- 
times of bad quality, owing to the long transport or original 
faults in the making. Such faults^e.^/., in Bourbon Naples 
— were engendered by oppressive fiscal imposts, which the 
cultivators had to pay before they were allowed to pulp and 
press their olives. 

The oil which runs spontaneously from the pulp of the 
olives, called virgin oil, is the best and least coloured, and 
is ready for immediate use. The oil which is obtained by 
the press is more or less turbid and slightly coloured, and 
has to be stored for some time to deposit its impurities 
and become clear. Olive-oil differs much in appearance 
and quality, according to its chemical composition. Some 
is colourless like water, and very liquid, consisting of 
almost pure olein ; other qualities are yellowish, greenish 
to green from chlorophyll, and more or less thick — that is 
to say, less mobile and liquid than the previously described 
qualities. All these may be of excellent taste ; they can 
be made more liquid by exposure to cold and removal of 
the crystallized fat. 

The use of oil requires the taking of some precautions ; 
every new portion of oil to be used should be heated for at 
least half an hour on a moderate fire, to avoid the rising of 
the oil and the loss of the fritter by ejection. This pheno- 
menon is perhaps due to the sudden evolution of water 
from one of the constituents at high temperatures. The 
evolution of this gas is promoted by agitating the hot 
oil — e.cj., by dashing in a fine spray of water, which 
bursts explosively, and is called * screaming the oil ' — z'.c, 
making it scream. It causes loss of oil, and the scattered 



CULINARY FATS AND THEIR COMPOSITION 283 

droplets cause pain and blisters. It is not a logical pro- 
ceeding. 

A number of other animal fats and vegetable oils are 
used for cooking in many parts of the earth ; but they are 
not abundant, and not of refined taste. Nut, almond, and 
2')opi)y-oil, when fresh, are excellent. Other oils — such as 
colza, cotton-seed, etc. — can be purified so as to be of no 
particular taste ; they may be good nutriment, but they 
do not possess the essence of attraction which we term 
flavour. Eastern nations use much sesame-oil, the flavour 
of which is repugnant to Western palates. Cacao butter, 
of which much is isolated in the manufacture of certain 
descriptions of chocolate, might be used, but is practically 
neglected. Cocoanut-oil also furnishes a kind of butter, 
which has a very fine flavour when pure; but it is used 
more for soap-making than for culinary purposes. 

Dumas, in his Dictionary, curiously enough, speaks of 
lard with the contempt of a Mahometan or of an unin- 
formed person ; while under the article Coclion he quotes, 
with evident approval, the hyperbolic sentence of Grimod 
de la Eeyniere : ' Sans le cochon, point de lard, et par con- 
sequent, point de cuisine.' Here it must be pointed out that 
the French word lard, in the first place, signifies bacon ; 
while what in England is termed lard, the fused, clarified, 
and recongealed fat of the hog, is by the French termed 
saindoux. 

The composition of animal fat tissues is complicated by 
the presence of membranes, and particularly of water, 
besides the fats. The fat tissue of the sheep varies much 
according to the part of the body from which it is taken. 
Thus, mutton suet (kidney fat) contains from 91 to 92 per 
cent, of pure fat, besides from 6 to 7 per cent, of water, 
and about 1 per cent, of membrane ; the fat fuses at from 
50 to 52° C. The omentum (net, caul) contains 94 per cent, 
of fat, and from 5 to 7 per cent, of water, and only 0-7 to 



284 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



0-9 per cent, of membrane. The fat tissue underneath the 
skin contains from 12 to 20 per cent, of water, and from 

84 to 79 per cent, of pure fat, and from 3 to 4 per cent, of 
membrane. 

Good suet from the ox contains 91 to 95 per cent, of fat, 
5 to 7 per cent, of water, and from 0-8 to 1-1 per cent, of 
membrane. The fat from the breast or sternum (brisket 
fat) of sheep and oxen is richest in water, 15 to 30 per 
cent., contains from 4 to 5 per cent, of meDibrane, and 70 to 

85 per cent, of fat. Yet this fat tissue is very solid and 
consistent even after it has been boiled, and this consistency 
and its excellent taste cause it to be much inquired after. 
The South Germans term this brisket fat ' breast kernel,' 
from the similarity of its taste to that of a nut. The hump 
of the camel is analogous to it both in structure and in 
taste. 

The fat tissues of the Jiog are throughout richer in pure 
fat, and contain less water (6 '44 per cent.) than those of 
oxen and sheep (water, 10 "48 per cent. mean). Good lard 
should contain only from ^^ to 1 per cent, of water, -J per 
cent, of nitrogenous matter, and at least 99 per cent, should 
consist of pure hog's fat. 

The fats of all three species of animals have an almost 
identical chemical elementary composition — namely, con- 
tain from 76*5 to 76 6 par cent, of carbon, 11*9 to 12 per 
cent, of hydrogen, and 11-3 to 11*5 per cent, of oxygen. 
With this the composition of cow-butter fat coincides very 
closely, but not entirely, as it contains 75'63 per cent, of 
carbon, 11*87 per cent, of hydrogen, and 12-50 per cent, of 
oxygen. Human fat has the same elementary composition 
as animal fat. 

In the animal and vegetable fats, which are soft or liquid 
at ordinary temperature, olein (or trioleo-glyceride) prevails ; 
as they get more solid, margarin or palmitin (trimargarito- 
or tripalmito-glyceride) rises in quantity ; with increasing 



THEORY OF THE PROCESS OF FRYING 285 



solidity of the fats, stearin (tristearo-glyceride) rises, and 
at last prevails in quantity. Ox suet is almost entirely 
composed of stearin, with very little of the other fats. 

The chemically imre fats have neither taste nor flavour ; 
these distinguishing qualities they obtain from the admixture 
of substances which are either naturally present or imparted 
by changes, such as oxidation or fermentation, or by art, 
particularly culinary art. On the other hand, flavour can 
be withdrawn from fats, and such tasteless and odourless fats 
might, like flavourless spirits, be termed nlcnt fats. De- 
composing fats are called rancid ; decomposing butter 
becomes very objectionable by the liberation of butyric 
acid ; decomposing animal fat tissue communicates the 
odour of the tissue in which it is stored to the liberated 
fat. Overheated or burnt fat, as it is called, assumes the 
disagreeable taste, and emits the irritating odour, of a 
substance formed from glycerol, termed acrol. 

Theory of the Process of Baking in Fat, called Frying 
(Phrygology). 

The operation of frying may be defined as the cooking of 
things intended to be eaten by means of fat ; it postulates 
a pure-tasting fat or oil, and a high degree of heat. The 
proper degree of heat is indicated by the fact that substances 
containing moisture, on being placed into hot fat, will 
apparently make it boil — that is to say, part with their 
water — and, w^hen their surface can be raised to a sufficiently 
high temperature, become yellow and brown. The expres- 
sion 'boiling fat,' w^hich is sometimes used in connection 
w^ith frying, has therefore to be interpreted as meaning, not 
fat assumed to boil by itself under the influence of heat, 
for it never does boil when pure, but fat in which a material 
suitable for being fried will cause the phenomenon of 
ebullition by itself giving out steam, and become brow^ned, 
or frit. 



286 THE [SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

In Italy frying is a popular art, in which most urban 
housewives and the average ixiysannes are experts ; the art of 
making o, fritto is no doubt facilitated by the plentiful supply 
of olive-oil. In the North of Europe, however, but few cooks 
understand the production of a good fritto, even with all the 
advantages of lard and butter. 

Frying can be effected in clarified butter, suet, lard, or 
olive-oil. The latter causes the surface of the fried material 
to be particularly crisp, and is particularly suited to the 
frying of some kinds of fish. When doughy substances 
being fried begin to float on the surface of the fat, or to 
burst by expansion, it is time to remove them with the wire 
cradle or spoon. Some kinds of dough, such as krajjfeii or 
the Eoman scriblita, float from the beginning when made 
with fermented dough, and with them colour is the only 
criterion of the completion of the coction ; a golden brown 
colour is the best, a darker brown may taste bitter. 

The fried material — or, as it is sometimes termed, the 
' fry ' — should be placed in a wire cradle, or on blotting- 
paper, to drain. It may then be salted or sugared, as the 
case may be. The Italians fry many things, which Northern 
Europeans merely boil — e.g.^ calf's head, cauliflower, arti- 
chokes ; and these are much better when enclosed in a 
batter of yolk, flour, and breadcrumb. Other materials — 
such as calf's liver, lamb's fry, water-melons, pumpkins, 
mushrooms — are better without any batter, but may be cut 
in slices or flat pieces, dusted with flour, and fried. 

Frying offers many advantages to the small household, 
the one particularly that it is the quickest mode of cooking 
raw materials ; above all, the objects retain their juice and 
flavour in a remarkable manner, if only suitable provisions 
are made. Thus, forcemeat may be enclosed in moist 
wafers, turned in yolk, covered with breadcrumb, and 
fried; ox-cheek may be cut in thin strips, and covered 
with yolk and lemon-juice, or surrounded with boiled and 



Process of frying, or phrygology 287 

pounded rice or puree of rice, and mixed with yolk. Such 
combinations may be infinitely varied. 

Parsley, savory, sage, and other fine herbs, fried crisp, 
serve as additions to other frits ; we think, however, fried 
herbs more curious than tasty, and liable to introduce 
confusing elements. Connoisseurs have been related to 
have tested candidates for the office of chef by giving them 
herbs to fry ; we ourselves should not attribute much 
importance to proficiency in this particular. 

Fritted fruits — e.g., plums, peaches, apples, quinces, oranges 
— require, like all tender mixtures of flour, milk, and eggs, 
an addition of sugar. They are eaten more for their taste 
than for nutrition. Most fritted viands are served by 
themselves, or with some lemon-juice only. On account of 
their prominent taste, they are mainly used as entrees. 

The breadcrumb with which it is intended to cover, by 
the adhesive mediation of beaten egg-yolk or batter, any 
viands about to be fried should be quite dry, and very finely 
powdered ; if the bread taken be moist, the fried crust 
becomes uneven, or broken and detached. By this over- 
sight, uninformed or improvident cooks often spoil good 
materials. 

While frying has the advantage that it can be done 
quicker than any other mode of preparation by heat, it 
furnishes no sauce or gravy ; and if such be required, it 
must be separately provided from extraneous sources ; or 
the fry may be strongly spiced, or, if suitable, covered with 
flavoured butter (of savory, of anchovies, parsley, or mush- 
rooms). 

The author of the ' Physiologic du Gout ' has recorded 
a series of instructions, in the shape of an allocution, to 
his cook, Maitre Laplanche. His friends, he said, admitted 
him to be a potcujiste of the first order, but they observed 
that he was uncertain as a friturier. The incident which 
is said to have given rise to the allocution was the serving 



2S8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

of a sole, which had been attempted to be fried, but was 
pale, soft, discoloured, and had distressed the company at 
table— Monsieur Eecamier, le docteur Eicherand, and le 
president Seguier. The professor thought that this had 
hapx^ened to the chef because he had neglected the theory 
of frying, of which he did not feel the importance, and 
lectured him on the physical laws involved in the con- 
sideration of the difference between the temperature of 
boiling water on the one hand, and of fat in which frying 
can be done on the other. We think the application better 
than the theory, and the incident quite bears out the state- 
ment of Careme and the relation of Pages, to the effect that 
a gentleman who could write and speak, more particularly 
speak, pathetically on cookery, had an indifferent cook. 

Fried things are well received at feasts as introducing an 
attractive variety, are pleasing to the eye by a certain light- 
brown, reddish colour prophetic of the taste of maturity, 
retain their original taste for some time, and can be eaten 
while being held with the fingers. The friture also gives to 
cooks opportunities for renovating broken remains of previous 
meals, and for providing quickly warm refections for un- 
expected guests. 

The quality of a fry depends upon the object being 
surjn'ised — that is to say, suddenly immersed in fat so hot 
that its outside becomes at once encased by a hardened 
surface, a cuirass soon to be browned. Then neither does 
the fat enter into the case so formed nor does the juice 
leave it, although it becomes concentrated by loss of steam. 
When the surprise has been effected, the heat must be 
moderated at once by moving the pan or damping the 
fire. 

Small fish — such as trout below a quarter of a pound, 
smelts, whiting — may be fried in oil, whitebait also ; but 
the latter are, in fact, fried more frequently in lard — oil 
would make them more crisp, and to some, at least, better 



THE PROCESS OF FRYING, OR PHRYGOLOGY 289 



flavoured. Of smelt the culinary professor says incidentally 
that it was * the becfigue of the waters, the same small 
size, the same perfume, the same superiority.' Probably 
as a contrast, or with a view of restoring his impaired 
reputation, Maitre Laplanche prepared an immense fried 
turbot, and thereby, says his master, * astonished the 
universe. ' 

It is stated that olive-oil does not bear to be heated as 
highly as butter, lard, and kidney fat, or suet, as it assumes 
an empyreumatic taste. But in the absence of precise ther- 
mometric data, the practical importance of this difference 
cannot be estimated ; it shows the empirical character of 
cookery, that the temperature of fats used for frying has 
never been ascertained with the thermometer by cooks 
themselves. 

French cooks distinguish practically two degrees of heat 
at which things may be fried — one yields the friture cliaude, 
and may be termed very Jiot fat ; the other jdelds the friture 
mod&ree, and may be called 7nedium hot fat. (The French 
also use the word friture for the frying material, the fat 
itself, although its natural meaning is that of the fried 
article.) The very hot fat is recognised by a little bread 
causing in it small ebullition, and then becoming surrounded 
by large bubbles ; while the medium hot fat causes small 
effervescence only, and no large bubbles. When the fat 
begins to be overheated, a more or less dense cloud of 
vapour appears over its surface, and spreads a disagreeable, 
penetrating, and adhesive odour. 

The best heat for frying is about 210^ to 220° of the Centi- 
ijrade thermometer; at that temperature frying is effected in 
the shortest time, and the product absorbs the least amount of 
fat. The matters which are fried at temperatures of from 
150° to 160° absorb the largest amount of fat (Dubrunfaut).

290 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Purification of Suet and other Alimentary Fats."^ 

Animal fats and oils which are deteriorated by a par- 
ticular odour are freed from this by the operation of being 
used for frying ; after that they can be used in all culinary 
operations, including the production of pastry, particularly 
puff-paste. Fish-oil is completely purified of its odoriferous 
principle by being heated to 330° C, or near the boiling- 
point of mercury. Fatty acids distil in a current of water- 
vapour heated to above 100", while neutral fats remain 
fixed ; but when the neutral fats have been previously 
heated to a temperature of from 300^ to 330°, they are 
decomposed, and the fatty acids distil with the superheated 
steam. 

The operation of frying itself purifies fats by the elimina- 
tion of the volatile fatty acids, which in general are the 
cause of the objectionable odour of fats. To purify fats in 
general, without imparting to them any flavour whatever, 
it is necessary to heat them slowly to 140° to 150°, and 
then cautiously throw in small quantities of water with a 
brush in minute droplets. This causes the fat to boil 
violently, almost explosively, with great noise (called 
* screaming '), and some spitting of fat abroad ; the operator 
must therefore keep face and hands at a distance to prevent 
the formation of minute burns and blisters. Mutton suet 
is purified of its peculiar odour by being heated to 150°, at 
which temperature the hircin is decomposed, and hircic acid 
passes away. During the siege of Paris some mutton-fat 
candles were thus purified, and the fat was used for food. 

Classification of Fried Objects. 
Fritters are a subdivision of fried objects, and their name 
has therefore a more limited application than that of the 

* Cf. Dubrunfaut, in a discussion in the Acadeiiiie des Sciences on 
January 1, 1871, reported by G. Orimaud de Caux. 



I 



CLASSIFICA770X OF FRIED OBJECTS 291 



French fritures, which comprises all fried articles as well 
as frying materials. Objects fit for being fried are pieces 
of meat, fish, poultry, game, or of fruit, or aggregates of 
comminuted things, such as minced meat, or pieces of 
bread, cake, etc., which are enclosed in a wrapper of some 
kind and fried therein. As a rule, only small objects are 
called fritters, and objects of the size of a cotelette, e.g., 
are no longer called fritters. 

Fritters may be divided in the following orders : 

Meat, jjoultry, game, and fish fritters. 

Croquettes, fritters made of viince or force meat. 

Kromeski/s (a la Busse), forcemeat balls wrapped in cowl. 

Bissoles, forcemeat wrapped in nouilles or ravioli-paste. 

Bissolettcs, small portions of farce on little fried crusts of 
bread. 

Croutons, small dice of fried bread, without any additions. 

The art of frying depends to a large extent for its success 
on the production of a suitable material with which the 
article to be fried is to be surrounded ; this material must 
generally be adhesive, viscous, not fluid in thin layers, and 
adapting itself to all inequalities of the surface which it is 
to cover ; it is generally a dough made of flour, eggs, butter, 
salt, water or milk, sufficiently liquid to allow the substances 
to be immersed in it ; it may receive an addition of egg- 
froth, which makes it a little more spongy ; its technical 
name is a batter. 

The theory of hatter is capable of being worked out into a 
separate essay; there are the varieties of hatter, those, e.g., 
which are made in large kitchens in quantity to serve for 
the day, or those which the eremite, or the cook of a young 
couple, or the young wife herself, may compound for the 
, day's occasion. The batter for pancake alone is a problem 
of which we shall have to take notice below, but it may be 
alluded to in tbis place. It is applicable (or, as there 
are several batters for pancake, we should say they are 



292 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

applicable) to fritters containing slices of apples, inneapples, 
oranges, ijeaches, and other fruit. We then have custard 
fritters, being steamed custard, battered and fried, a useful 
form for the reservice of remainders ; cake fritters, made, e.g., 
with remains of brioche, baba or ratan cake, Kugelhopfen, 
or even roll or bread ; they must be soaked well and long 
in milk, cream, or some juice, sugared, flavoured, battered, 
and fried crisp. Whole-hoiled rice, with any juice, and 
coated with batter, makes excellent fritters, sometimes 
miscalled croquettes. Varieties are produced by additions 
and flavours ; thus, the Italians have a favourite variety, 
rice and ginger fritters, to which they give the name of 
diavolini. [Brioche fritters, made with the unbaked 
brioche-paste directly, and Spanish puffs, or petit-choux, 
rather belong to the class of fritures represented by Krapfen, 
and not to the present division.] 

Croquettes are fritures made of balls of mince or force 
meat, rolled in breadcrumb, dipped in beaten egg, crumbed 
a second time, and fried in hog's lard to a light colour. 

There .are croquettes of boiled beef, of chicJcen — elaborate 
ones, e.g., with tongue and truffles — of siveetbread, pheasant, 
rabbit, fat livers, lobster, turbot, sole, and others more 
rare. 

Kromeskys {a la Busse), also called kramouskys, are force- 
meat balls of any of the materials just mentioned, wrapped 
in braised ccdfs udder, thinly cut, immersed in butter, and 
fried in hog's lard ; instead of calf's udder, ccdfs coicl (net, 
omentum) may be used as a wrapper. According to some 
authors, the specialities of a kromesky are a little jacket of 
fat bacon, in which it is enveloped, and the batter in which 
it is dipped. The bacon should be previously cooked and 
cut into thin slices ; each slice may envelop, e.g., tsvo 
oysters, or a teaspoonful of any salpicon. 

The form is said by some to be Eussian, by others 
Polish ; the same uncertainty adumbrates either name. The 



CLASSIFICA TION OF FRITURES 293 



kromesky is thus seen to contain the same kind of salpicon 
as the bouchee or the croquette ; it differs from the latter 
not even in shape, but only by the material by which the 
shape is maintained. 

liissoles are a kind of pastry made of minced and spiced 
meat or vegetables, or fruit, wrapped in a paste, and fried 
in lard. The paste may be the one used for nouilles or 
ravioli. Probably these preparations were originally made 
with whole rice, and this gave the name. From the word 
and thing rissole are derived the verb rissoler, to give a nice 
red colour to baked and roasted meat, and the diminutive 
rissolettes, little portions of farce, served on little crusts of 
bread, called croidddes. 

There are recipes for many varieties of rissoles — some 
for every day, some for fast-days ; some are to be used as 
hors cVoeuvre for garnish. Besides the savoury ones, many 
forms contain vegetables only, such as spinach and mush- 
rooms, and fruit, such as apricot. 

The term rissolettes, or croiUades, is a modern French 
expression for the old Italian crustini, the little excavated 
pieces of fried bread, which are charged with some force- 
meat or tiny portions of fine ragout ; these savoury parts 
are not fried. 

Croutons are the most simple fritures, and are used with 
soups, ragouts, and entremets. They are always tasty, and 
far excel mere toasted bread, even as sippets, or suckers up 
of gravy or sauce. They should be crisp, but not hard, 
have a firm exterior and soft interior. Hard croutons, 
necessitating noisy crunching, are not aasthetical.

CHAPTER XXII. 

FARCE, OR FORCEMEAT, FOR STUFFINGS ; 
QUENELLES AND GRATINS, GODIVEAUS. 

Farce is a French culinary expression, derived from the 
Latin farsuvi, for a mixture of minced or pounded meat, 
fat, bread, and spice, or, the bread being omitted, for 
sausage-meat only (farcinioi, sausage), or for farinaceous 
egg-bound preparations, to be used for stuffing birds to be 
l)oiled or roasted, or filling raised pies, or the hollows of 
hard-boiled eggs after removal of the yolks, or for serving 
as material for gratins. The English forcemeat is derived 
from the French viande farcee, but for forcemeat 1)alls the 
French use the expression boidettcs de hacJiis. Forcemeat 
is prepared of different qualities, according to the applica- 
tion for which it is intended. Thus, for filling raised pies 
entirely or in part, it is not made of such select material, 
and not reduced to such fineness as for the production of 
quenelles, which require the greatest comminution ; on the 
other hand, stuffings and gratins permit of a greater ad- 
mixture of egg and panade than quenelles, and the more 
savoury the pie is to be, the more its contents must be 
confined to fleshy and fatty ingredients. The name of 
(juenelles is confined to small forcemeat balls given with 
soups or ragouts. We believe the word not to be very 
current in French kitchens. In Germany its equivalent is 
hieffs, which seems derived from the Greek knesvia. 

The varieties of forcemeat are many, and those most com- 
monly prepared are made of veal for balls, of veal a)id porlc 
mixed, of veal or foivl with calfs liver, or (variation) foicr^ 
liver; forcemeat for cold pasties is mainly composed of 
veal and pork, well flavoured and spiced ; of fowl's flesh, 



FORCEMEAT FOR STUFFINGS, ETC. 295 

in which case some cooks are satisfied with old hens as 
material; of partridycs and pJicasants, in which cases also 
age is no objection, if the meat be pounded and mixed with 
panada and butter. Of fish several varieties are suitable 
for farce ; foremiost the icliit'ing, because it is neutral, and 
may be adapted to a variety of farces ; haddocks, eels, and 
the cheaper varieties of fish should be employed. Lobster 
also is suitable. All fish farces require binding material, 
panada, egg-yolk, and thick sauce. The liver of calves and of 
venison also gives a good farce, by scraping and using the 
pulp only. Veal and pork also may be scraped instead of 
minced and pounded, and thus become most suitable for 
stuffings for turkeys and ciqjons. Smaller birds, like 2^iy<^oiis, 
of milder taste, are better stuffed with a savoury panada, 
well spiced and egged, and kept rather fat. The panada 
should be soaked in broth. Many cooks prefer as binding 
material for farce a hatter made of flour, butter, chicken- 
broth, and eggs, and cooked, called cooked hatter, or pate a 
choux ; from its substitution for panada, it is also termed jjrt^c 
a choux panada, a false pleonasm to be discontinued. The 
reason for which this paste was called a choux has not 
been preserved. The broth panada and cooked batter are 
mainly used with minces or purees of meat for the pro- 
duction of quenelles. Water panada is a regular ingredient 
of so-called Camhridgc sausages; such on every section 
become blue-black with iodine. Apart from the question 
of diminished value, the admixture of bread not rarely 
gives rise to the formation of sugar from starch by the 
diastatic action of the gut in which the farce is enclosed. 

A delicate farce much fancied by the French is made of 
calfs udder boiled in broth and transformed into puree ; 
mixed with pounded fillets of chicken, panada, etc., and 
delicately spiced and sauced, it forms an excellent material 
for quenelles. Variations are obtained b}/ substituting for 
fowl grouse, pheasant, partridge, or hare. When small birds, 



296 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



such as quails, snipes, larks, plovers, and dottrel, are 
obtainable, their fillets form good material for quenelles. 

Several varieties of farce deserve the special attention of 
connoisseurs, such as that of liver and ham for raised pies. 
In ordinary culinary works the selection of a light-coloured 
calf's liver is prescribed. But no healthy liver is naturally 
light-coloured, and those which appear to be so in trade are 
made pale by the butchers, by immersion in water. How- 
ever, this process affects only a thin outer layer of the liver 
tissue; to effectually blanch a liver, i.e., to wash out the 
blood contained in it, it is necessary to tie it to a water-tap 
inserted into the opening of the portal vein, and let the 
water run through it for some time. This treatment also 
removes the last traces of bitterness. If this be not feasible, 
the liver may be sliced and laid in water, or may be scraped, 
and the pulp washed in a cloth. But the process is un- 
necessary, except where the colour of the quenelles is to be 
pale and not dark. Gratins require a farce with much fat, 
and are, therefore, best made with livers of geese, or with 
scraped calf's liver mixed wdth much bacon fat. 

Godiveau is a kind of farce used for garnishing the 
interior of hotixUes, vol-aa-vents, Sind tourtes a la cihoulette ; 
it may be made of veal, with beef-suet, parsley, and spices ; 
or of flesh oifoivl, or of cjame with truffles, or of mushrooms, 
or oifish, turbot, eel, carp, all with panada. 

Godiveaus are generally preferred to be made with a 
particular binding material, called crenie pdtissiere, which 
is analogous to the cooked batter above alluded to ; it 
consists of eijgs, flour and milk, is heated to boiling, cooled 
in water, and then mixed with the minced meat. 

In Baton's Dictionary it is stated that at many tables, 
where everything else is well done, it is common to find 
very bad stuffing. This is as true now as it was in 1822. 



RAGOVTS OF J/rS/y/WOJ/S 297 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

RAGOUTS^ OF VEGETABLES, AND COMPOUND 
RAGOUTS OF VEGETABLES AND MEAT. 

RagoCts of vegetables, ou stewed vegetables for garnisbing 
braised and boiled meat dishes, are mainly characterized by 
cryptogams — fungi or mushrooins. The common mushroom^ 
Agaricus campestrls, L., is usually eaten at two stages of its 
growth, one when it has just risen from the niyccliiiin, and 
is small, with its hymen still closed, called button, and the 
other when it is just expanded, its hymen forming a ring 
round the stalk, and the spore-bearing ridges forming a rosy 
lining to the expanded umbrella. To be valuable they must 
be plump at both these stages ; the spores may just have 
turned black, but, on the whole, such mushrooms are over- 
ripe. Flabby, leathery, expanded, fissured, black-lined 
mushrooms are to be avoided. 

Of all animal and vegetable matters, only three possess 
the iwinciple of sapidity in the highest culinary and gusta- 
tory sense, namely, meat, cheese, and mushrooms. This 
principle is an alkaloid, or a series of alkaloids, which is 
practically designated as osmazoiue. It is most developed 
when it is somewhat overheated, or browned ; hence, mush- 
rooms are most sapid w^hen fried in fat, and darkened by 
that process, as well as by the distribution of spores, which 
also become dark or black by heat. 

In France and Germany the agaricus passes under the 
name of champignon, but in England it is called mushroom. 
This is a special application of the French name mousseron , 
of which more below. The agaricus contains above 91 per 
cent, of water, 2| per cent, of nitrogenized substance, 1 per 
mille fat, nearly 1 per cent, of mannite and grape-sugar ; 
soluble matter free from nitrogen above 3*7 percent., woody 



298 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



fibre or cellulose 067 per cent., and 0*76 per cent, of 
inorganic constituents. [Truffles are much less watery, and 
contain the nutritive constituents in more than double the 
quantities in which they are present in agarics.] The ash 
amounts to more than 5 per cent, of the dry substance ; 
one-half of it is potash, one-quarter sulphuric acid, and at 
least 15 psr cent, is phosphoric acid. Starch has never 
been found in fungi. 

Mushrooms grown in the open air, on meadows, or in 
shaded glens, have the best flavour. We recognise two 
particular varieties of the Ayaricus cainjiestiis, one white, 
the other brown-speckled on the convex side. They are 
difficult to rear by art, or, at least, their growth is uncer- 
tain. They are more easily reared in caves, such as the 
quarries below Paris ; but these subterranean products have 
much less flavour. The great use which is made of mush- 
rooms in cookery is evident from the special recipes with 
which literature abounds. 

There are numerous modes of preparing mushrooms on 
record, besides simple frying in butter, which we consider 
the best of all ; they may be slowly fried — i.e., gratinctted 
while filled with /arcc ; dressed with oil, or gratinated sous 
la tourtiere, so as to resemble those done by braising ; or 
fried and laid on fried bread, croiUes aux champignons. 

The name of mousscrons is given to several small edible 
varieties of fungi of the agaricus family which grow among 
the moss. From this circumstance the French name and the 
English word * mushroom,' now exclusively given to Agaricus 
canqjcstris, are alike derived. The mousserons are partly 
eaten fresh, partly collected and dried, and then look like 
pieces of old leather. Italian merchants in London sell 
these mixtures, called fughi, at about half a crown a pound. 
They are powdered for being placed in ragouts. The 
Mousseron cV Armas is eaten in Provence; there are further, 
the Mousseron blanc, Agaricus albellus, D.C.; the Mousseron 



RAGOUTS OF MUSHROOMS, TRUFFLES, ETC. 299 

faux, A. tortilis, D.C. ; the (jray Monsseron, A. vioussewn, 
Bull.; and the Mousscron ijetitc oreille, A. vmjineiis, Pers. 
These mousserons were used mixed for the production of 
ragouts. It is related that Barras, the Director who pro- 
duced Napoleon and the 13th Vendemiaire, employed 
several individuals to collect these delicate fungi for him. 
He had them prepared by frying in butter or lard with herbs 
and pepper ; the fry was then moistened with veal-broth or 
bouillon, and reduced, and the sauce thickened with butter 
and Hour. 

Another edible fungus is the morel, Morchdla csculeiita, 
Pers. (PJiallus csculcntiis of Linne) ; Fr. viorcllc. Germ. 
MorcJicl. It is agreeably flavoured, of a firm spongy con- 
sistency, and abounds in April and May in certain localities, 
along wet ditches. It is eaten cooked fresh, or strung up 
to dry. Some champignons pass in France under the name 
of d'pesfrancs, in two varieties, white and black. They yield 
extracts of good flavour, but are liable to degenerate during 
preparation and become uneatable. 

At the sight of truffles, or even the hearing of their name, 
a proper French gastronomer is expected to go into ecstasies 
of delight and admiration. French authors call them the 
sacrum sacrorum of gastronomers, the diamonds of the 
kitchen, and other nonsense. According to Dumas, the 
truffle says, ' Eat me and adore God.' He also informs us 
that to write the history of truffles would be attempting an 
account of the civilization of the world. The author of * The 
Physiology of Taste ' ascribes to truffles such metax^hysical 
effects as that * they awaken erotic recollections,' and, with- 
out being positively aphrodisiac, will, under certain con- 
ditions, make women more loving and men more amiable. 

The truffle, Tuber ciharium, or Lycoperdon gulosoruni, 
grows nearly in the w^hole of France), south of Burgundy, 
wild and uncultivated. It assumes four modificatious, of 
which three are distinguished by the colour of their flesh, 



3CXJ THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



the black being mainly of Perigord, the white of Burgundy, 
a gray and violet variety of no particular home, while the 
fourth, Piedmontese, also white, is marked by its odour of 
garlic. It grows from six to seven inches below the surface, 
and has to be discovered and dug up. The collectors employ 
trained dogs and learned pigs in their searches. This diffi- 
cult mode of collection and relative rarity of the trufHes 
explains in part their high price. 

Truffles contain less water than any other edible fungi, 
namely, 72-80 per cent. ; their nitrogenized ingredients rise 
to 8-91 per cent., their ingredients free from nitrogen to 
7*54 per cent. ; but with these they contain 7-92 per cent, of 
woody fibre or insoluble cellulose, and 2-21 per cent, of 
inorganic materials. In the ash potash and phosphoric 
acid prevail, while only little sulphuric acid is present. 
Now, it is this amount of woody fibre which makes all 
trufiles, if not hard, at least very solid, and thus contrasting 
with the tenderness of the mushroom, and detracts much 
from their quality as ' food for the gods,' however attractive 
may be their flavour to mortal palates. 

The name of truffle is derived from the Itahan tartufolo, 
the diminutive of tartufo, signifying he who hides or dis- 
guises himself. According to Pliny, Apicius and Lucullus 
imported truffles from Libya, by Carthage, to Rome. 
According to Galen, the Greeks also valued them, and at 
Athens the rights of citizenship were accorded to the 
children of Cherips on account of his having invented a 
new kind of ragout wdth truffles for flavour. 

The Piedmontese truffle, Tuher griseuni, Pers., Piedm. 
tfuffola, is white or gray, and has the alliaceous taste, on 
account of which it is preferred by the southern Kelts. 
They preserve it in fused ])utter. Napoleon's cooks carried 
it with them to Russia, and those of Louis XVIII. occa- 
sionally paid half a crown an ounce for it. Trufiles are dear 
at a shilling an ounce. 



TRUFFLES, THEIR HISTORY AND PREPARATION 30T 



The antique truffle brought from Africa to Eome was 
probably a distinct variety, Tuber niveicm, Desfontaines. 

Many essays have been written on truffles, one of the 
earliest being by T. Eobinson, published in 1693. A 
German author, A. Bornholz, treated of their cultivation, 
and his work was translated into French in 1826. The 
praises of truffles are often as absurd as the condemnations 
launched against them. A goodly collection of both kinds 
of animadversion may be found in the work of Dumas, who 
says truly that he belonged to a time in which truffles had 
been more in fashion than at any other period : ' Les Bour- 
bons de la Branche ainee gouvernaient, disait-on, avec des 
truffes.' Whatever may be the result of the analysis of this 
sentence, the connection between this family and truffles 
did not turn out to be a prosperous one, and perhaps, as a 
consequence, modern Frenchmen look upon truffles with the 
same limited but just appreciation as we do ourselves. 

To insure the good quality of truffles the purchaser should 
select them as round or globular as possible ; press them in 
the hand and see that they are resisteut, and neither soft 
nor adhesive ; he should smell them to ascertain their 
flavour — if they have an odour or taste of cheese, they are 
spoiled, and must be rejected ; he should next throw them 
in fresh water, and separate those which float, and which 
are inferior, from those which remain at the bottom ; he 
should brush them to remove all earth, and change the 
water, which should always be cold (52° F.), until it is not 
changed by the tubers any longer. In case any skewers l)e 
seen, they should be drawn to make sure that several truffles 
have not been fastened together to make a large one. The 
finest truffles are generally sent to table en serviette, while 
the smaller and inferior ones are cut up in slices, dice, and 
mince, and used in sauces, ragouts, and minces. Truffles 
are in season from November to March. 

Truffles may be added to many dishes, but in this place 



302 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

we wish to take notice only of such preparations as preserve 
the identity of the tubers. They may be hakcd in ashes, 
braised in a wine mirepoix, or steamed ocer hrandij andicater. 
The result of the braising is called by the French Truffes 
a la serviette, because they are carried to table on a napkin. 
The mirepoix is to contain a bottle of wine (Dumas has 
champagne ; Baron Thiry orders wine of CoUioure, M. 
Bignon, Madeira or Jerez). The application of alcohol in 
this manner appears to be both extravagant and un- 
sesthetical. The wine or spirit does not enter into the 
truffle, happily for its taste, but boils away, and does not 
even furnish a good sauce. It is therefore preferable, for 
all those who desire to preserve to the truffles their natural 
unmixed flavour, to wrap them in buttered paper and steam 
them in a suitable apparatus, or bake them in hot ashes, or, 
most conveniently, bake them, wrapped in buttered paper, 
in an oven. Truffles boiled in court bouillon are a mere 
variety of those braised in wine mirepoix. When such 
truffles are set up in a pyramid they are called en roche, 
therefore peculiar only as to external form. Truffles may 
be minced, fried, gratinated, excavated and stuff ed icitli farce, 
baked in slices with Parma cheese, or boiled and roasted on 
a spit while being basted with oil, lemon-juice, and spices. 
They may be made into a ragout with any sauce, espagnole 
being the most suitable, some varieties being called 
a Vltcdienne, a la Piemontaise, and a laPirigueux, or formed 
into a pudding in glace, i.e., savoury jelly; mixed with 
mushrooms, etc. The white Piedmontese truffles do not 
require to be cooked, l)ut, after having been thinly sliced, 
may be dropped in any hot sauce or garnish with which 
they are to be associated. 

A technically distinct preparation to be mentioDcd in this 
place is D'Uxelles, which may be termed a ragout, but is, 
perhaps, more properly termed a vegetable farce, consisting 
of minced mushrooms, parsley, shallots, butter, and spices, 



RAGOUTS, irUXELLES, SALPICONS 303 

all fried ; it is to be used as an ingredient for sauces or as 
a stuffing for tomatoes. 

A ragout is defined as a rich compound, consisting of 
quenelles, mushrooms, truffles, fat livers, etc., mixed with 
a rich sauce, and used for garnishing highly-finished removes 
and entrees. It is therefore not really a dish by itself, but 
a complement or garnish for other preparations, though 
these, when so garnished, are also termed ragoiits. 

It was particularly by ragouts that the ancient French art 
of cooking gained the esteem of the world, and by contrast 
it is in the matter of ragouts that most culinary enormities 
are committed in modern kitchens both in and out of France. 

One of the oldest ragouts that have preserved a specific 
name is the saljncon. It may consist of any kind of meat 
and vegetables, sweetbread, truffles, mushrooms, artichoke 
bottoms, etc., all to be stewed, separately or in groups, as 
they require different periods for coction. The French 
word salpico7i, spelled salipicon up to 1740, is alleged to be 
derived from sal, salt, and inquer, and to signify, and have 
anciently signified, a dish made of gherkins, ham, truflles, 
etc., flavoured with vinegar (Heyse, * Etym. Diet.'). Con- 
sidering the original meaning of the word ragout — it is 
derived from rag outer, to give again taste {gout) to a 
matter, or cause new appetite to a person — namely, a meat- 
dish, made more savoury by sauce, we can accept the 
definition of salpicon. It is also contended that ragout was 
constructed to signify a dish which consisted of materials 
which had been cooked and on the table before in another 
form, and came now in a new form, not merely warmed up, 
but reconstituted. But we do not find this meaning in the 
Academic Dictionary, where ragout is a stew, and ragoutsr 
is defined as meaning to restore the appetite, to stimulate, 
etc., whence this particular stew would be a dish intended 
to stimulate the appetite quite irrespective of the fresh or 
rechauffe nature of its ingredients. 



3C4 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



A common saljncon would contain sweetbread and fat 
livers, with fungi, or quenelles, or godiveau, white meat of 
fowls previously roasted, cocks' combs, and artichoke 
bottoms, all wdth espagnole sauce. 

Most ragouts admit of being presented in a white modi- 
fication — i.e., with veloute sauce; or a brown form — i.e., 
with espagnole. Of the great number of ragouts to be 
found in magiric literature, we shall mention only the 
characteristic or important ones : 

Bagout of Stveetbread — one of the finest ; of Cocks' 
Comhs and Kernels, called en Financiere, from the sauce. 
These bodies, being themselves tasteless, require careful 
saucing to serve as vehicles ; if badly prepared, they justly 
excite contempt. BagoiU d la Toulouse is very complicated ; 
may be given with allemande or supreme sauce in a vol-au- 
vent or a casserole of rice. From its many optional in- 
gredients, it is also called BagoiU meU and BagoiU fin. 
Calf's-head Bagoiit {en Tortue, because the calf's head is 
prepared as for mock-turtle) is an excellent preparation ; 
the one called a la Chipolata contains more strongly spiced 
farce to serve as garnish to roast or boiled turkey, capon, 
or poulard. Similarly classical are the ragouts of Ox-palates ; 
Bed Sheej^s Tongues ; Stuffed Chicken-iuings ; Fillets of Fowl 
or Game ; Fillets of Larks ; Goose-liver, d la Strasbourg ; 
Quenelles of Chicken ; of Eel- fillets ; of C r ay fisli- tails and 
Quenelles of Whiting ; of Crayfish-tails, Mussels, and Oysters ; 
of Praicns or Shrimps in place of Crayfish ; of Fillets of Sole, 
Salmon, Trout ; soft Boe of Carp or other fish. 

Of curiosities amoDgst ragouts, we have met with two — 
one of Carps^ Tongues, a mockery of an antiquated paradox ; 
and a BagoiU of Babbits' Tongues, which was imagined and 
produced by Vuillemot. 

An old form of ragout is termed a Terrine, and is really 
an entree, which takes its name from the former custom of 
serving the meat in the very terrine in which it had been 



1 



PUREES OE VEGETABLES 305 



cooked. Later on a terrine came to be composed of several 
varieties of meat braised together, and served in a vessel 
still called terrine — i.e., earthenware pan — but mostly made 
of silver or porcelain, or enamelled iron. Prepared ragouts, 
or cold pates, such as the livers of ducks of Toulouse or 
of Nerac, are sold and sent in terrines (tureens). The 
Terrine d Vancienne mode, or du Louvre, made according to 
a recipe by Leclercq, had the greatest reputation amongst 
dishes of this kind ; its ingredients were fat chicken, 
partridge, back of hare, nut of veal and of mutton, all 
larded and spiced, boiled in broth, with roasted chestnuts 
and fine herbs added. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

PUREES OF VEGETABLES USED AS GARNISHES OE 
AS ENTREES. 

The name puree was originally confined to pea soup, 
as we see from Varenne,* where it is considered as 
interchangeable with this (' Potage aux pois, ou puree'). 
The soaked and swelled peas are to be boiled, and the 
bouillon is to be taken off without crushiug the peas ; if 
more bouillon be wanted, a second decoction may be made. 
It was this bouillon without the peas which was termed 
puree, and was more particularly speciahzed o.?, puree claire, 
and used as the bouillon for soups au maigrc. Thus, the 
frog soup and crayfish soup {' Potage aux ecrevisses en fa^on 
de bisque') were to be made w^ith it,f and it was declared 
preferable to fish bouillon. But in the course of time the 
entire pea soup, with the crushed and disintegrated peas in 
it, was called puree, and then gradually the liquid was lost

3o5 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



sight of, and the name i)urea was applied to the thick 
paste of peas only, and to various other matters which 
admitted of similar treatment, and thus the following 
defioition was arrived at. Purees are the products obtained 
by cooking, mashing, crushing, pounding, and sifting, from 
farinaceous substances, such as chestnuts, potatoes, or peas. 
These lend themselves naturally to the production of these 
preparations ; but a number of other edible substances, 
vegetable as well as animal, have been forced through the 
process for the production of purees, and although they are 
not so suitable as the leguminous seeds, they furnish pro- 
ducts of essential usefulness in culinary practice, for purees 
may be served as dishes by themselves, or as garnishes or 
bases for roasts and entrees. They differ from sauces by 
their greater consistency and firmness, while a great number 
of them serve as bases — i.e., principal materials — for soups, 
of which they form the characteristic solid ingredients. 
To these we have already referred in previous paragraphs ; 
here we confine our view to those preparations which serve 
as garnishes or as dishes by themselves. 

Some authors have words of lively praise for purees, and 
think that they ought to be more generally understood and 
practised. The production of a puree is essentially, as a 
certain interpretation of the name indicates, a purifying 
process, whereby edible parts are separated and removed 
from the rough or hard or inedible parts, and that by the 
mechanism of sifting. Thus, from leguminous fruit the 
indigestible shells are removed ; from roots and leaves the 
stringy cellulose. Meat, which from its poverty or tough- 
ness would be sorry fare if boiled or roasted only, can be 
worked into a palatable and digestible condition. Old hens 
or partridges, the remains of cold poultry and of all game, 
can be turned to good account in a puree. Even an ancient 
and extraordinarily tough moorghee of Madras, says * Wyvern,' 
may be thus rendered fit to be eaten. Such vegetable and 



PUREES IN GENERAL 307 

meat purees are of great value to the sick, and even to 
persons suffering from defects of the masticating organs, or 
local affections of the mouth, tongue, and throat, and may 
be made useful as part of the diet of children. 

The instrunieiits necessary for the production of puree in 
general are, in the first place, those which will quince meat 
very fine, or a mincing-machine so called, cutting by revolving 
and fixed knives, and pressing through metal sieves with 
round holes; mincing-knives of semilunar shape, which cut 
by rocking action, hence called rocking-knives ; a strong 
mortar of marble, and a pestle of boxwood — the mortar 
should be permanently placed on a block of icood, being a 
section of a tree somewhat wider in diameter than the 
mortar. There should then be large hair sieves of horse- 
hair, with from 72 to 144 openings to the square inch, and 
wire sieves ; it is useful to have sieves of different widths 
of the openings, as their successive use saves both time and 
labour. 

The tougher materials having been minced, can be pre- 
pared for passing the sieve only by strong pounding. This is 
best effected if the quantities taken are not too large ; mere 
trituration is sufficient in the case of leguminous seeds, but 
coherent materials require to be comminuted by strong 
blows of the pestle. Then place the sieve over a large bowl 
or dish, so that it stands entirely within it ; put the pulp on 
the sieve and triturate it with a wooden spoon. Some 
cooks from time to time invert the sieve, and scrape off the 
portion of the puree which adheres to the under side ; but 
this seems not in any way mechanically useful, but a 
natural impatience to estimate the increase of the result of 
the work done. Eemove the remainder from the top, to 
pound it again if necessary, and wash the sieve in hot 
water, to clear the meshes of any fixed fibres. We have 
found a stiff circular disc-like brush, with a central perpen- 
dicular handle, an excellent substitute for the spoon, and 



3o8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

iavaluable for clearing the meshes of fibres. Such a brush 
must, however, be kept very clean and free from taste. 

The mere application of pressure by means of the spoon 
will not so much cause the puree to pass, as the hair or 
wire of the sieve to hidgc doivmvards, and then the gaps 
which form will allow crude parts to pass, and spoil the rest 
of the operation. Where, as in the case of soups, there is 
plenty of fluid at disposal, you may repeatedly use that 
which has passed by pouring it back on the sieve ; on the 
other hand, the drier the puree, the more rubbing does it 
require to get it through the tammy. At last there remains 
a portion of material on the sieve which has to be rejected, 
and in this respect also the cook has to exercise judgment. 
He must cease triturating when the desirable particles have 
passed, and before any undesirable ones are sufficiently 
ground down to pass through the tammy. 

Amongst tlie Purees of Fruit and Seeds, that of Chestnuts 
is the most perfect and desirable. In cookery we have to 
range chestnuts with leguminous seeds, although they 
differ widely from them in a botanical sense. They are the 
fruit of the tree which was for some time ranged with the 
oaks, and called by Linne Fagus castanea ; but it was 
again separated from the oak and called Castanea vesca. 
The English name ' chestnuts' is a slightly corrupted transla- 
tion of the old Latin name used, e.g., by Virgil, of Castanea' 
nuces. This name is merely the result of the accident that 
many of these nuts were imported into Italy from Castaua 
111 Thessaly. This has led to the surmise that the tree w^as 
indigenous in Thessaly, but this is doubtful. The tree is 
certainly indigenous to Europe — at least, was not brought to 
it from other parts within historical times, and does not 
prosper in other continents except under cultivation. It 
thus differs as regards origin and history from the horse- 
chestnut, JEsculus hippocastanumy which w^as imported into 
Europe from India about three centuries ago. 



PUREES OF SEEDS AND FRUIT 309 



Vnrie of Chestmifs is appropriate for use in the form of 
souj), as well as of saiicc, to accompany icJiite entrees, and 
especially the turkey. For the production of a brown 
puree the chestnuts have to be carefully roasted, so as to 
become caramelized. 

Purees of Peas admit of great variation, according to 
whether they are produced from dry yellow, or green split, 
or qreen or fresh peas. Lentils, haricot beans, and other 
leguminous seeds are managed like peas. In Russia and 
Germany Piirt^e of Haricot Beans, particularly of the largo 
w^hite climbing variety, is a favourite dish with a great 
proportion of the population. It is eaten as a garnish to 
an entremets made from tJie green pods of the same bean or 
of scarlet runners, 'pveserYed in salt and subjected to fermen- 
tation like sauer-kraut. The sugar contained in the beans 
is phaseomannite, identical with sugar found in flesh and 
brain-tissue called inosite. The acid developed by its fer- 
mentation in the presence of salt is lactic acid, the same as 
that present in sour milk or in hung meat. 

Puree of Tomatoes requires either evaporation of the 
excess of water from the juice, or the addition of a thicken- 
ing roux. 

Puree of Apples is well known in this country under the 
name of apple sauce. The apples used in its production 
should be sour, such as Wellingtons ; mild or sweet apples 
produce a flat puree. Apples have this advantage in cook- 
ing, that they fall to pulp completely with moderate stirring, 
and do not require to be rubbed through a tammy ; but 
such passing makes the puree more smooth, and distributes 
the sugar and spice which have to be added in an even 
manner. 

Almonds and other nuts, including the Indian one known 
as Promotion-nut, make good purees. Of the ground-nut 
authors speak hypothetically, without apparently having 
put it to practical use. 



3TO y/Z/f SPTRTT OF COOKERY 



FurhR of Ciicumhcr, Piiinpl-iii and Vegetahle Marroir, or 
Gourd, are excellent preparations, provided their water be 
condensed and they be made savoury by coulis. White 
and creamy dressings are less attractive. The puree of the 
edible large pumpkin has a fine golden or orange colour ; it 
is much used in France. The pulp contains much of the 
tender cellulose which is digestible. 

Pun^e of Frcncli (green) Beans is a passable form for green 
beans which have become stringy ; applied to tender pods 
it seems a superfluity, a waste. Its colour may be improved 
by the addition of spinach-extract. 

Of the Purees of Boots and Tubers, that of the Four Boots 
so called, or a la Croissy, consists of onions (which are bulbs), 
and three true roots, namely carrots, turniijs, and iKirsnips. 
They must be stewed in coulis, and not boiled in water. 

The distinction between a puree properly so called, to be 
used as, or in connection with, an entree, and a puree 
intended to serve as an ingredient of a soup, is not very 
rigidly upheld, and has perhaps never been discussed. A 
perusal of the hst of purees does, however, yield evidence 
that some of them are used as entremets only in the un- 
diluted state, while others are used exclusively in soiqjs. 
To these latter belongs the Puree of Carrots, which is not 
used as an independent dish. The carrots must be braised 
in savoury coulis. 

Pun'e of Turnips is used as an independent dish. It may 
be prepared in two forms, ivhite and hrouii ; the latter is 
less digestible. Some cooks add breadcrumb or panada to 
this puree to restore consistency after addition of the 
savoury sauce. 

The Purees of Celeriac and Parsnip are best dressed with 
espagnole ; those of Topinamhur or Jerusalem Artichohc have 
a tine flavour which should not be overtoned by additions. 
Purees of Potatoes are not quite congruent with mashed 
l^otatoes, but have to be kept a trifle thinner. 

Amongst the Purees of Bulbs, that of onions takes the first 



PUREES OE VEGETABLES 311 



place. Like most dishes with prevalence of onions, it passes 
in France under the cognomen a la Soiibise. It can be 
made in two varieties — one white, the other brown. For 
both the sliced onions should be parboiled in water and 
pressed in a cloth, to make them milder. The puree from 
red onions, called Brctonne, is finished with espagnole. 
Pur^e of Leek is to be 'coloured with spinach-green. 
Of the Purees of Leaves, that of spinach (or spinage) is the 
lion. It requires butter, some sorrel, and savoury coulis. 
Purine of Sorrel is too acid to be used in any other form 
than as sauce, or as an addition to spinach. The acid 
principle is binoxalate of potash (salt of sorrel), the same as 
in the leaf-stalks of rhubarb. 

Endive yields a mild puree to be dressed in bechamel or 
veloute. 

Pur^e of Celery also is very mild", to some palates flat. 
Of the Purees made from S^jrouts, those of Asparagus, Hops, 
Seakale, Brussel-sprotUs, are the most conspicuous. To the 
Purees of Stalks and hifiorescences beloDg those of Caulifloiver 
and Artichokes. The last preparations of this kind which 
we have to mention are those of Trtcffles and Miislirooms. 
On all these products a great amount of ingenuity has 
been bestow^ed, which only intimates are able to appreciate. 
It is always necessary carefully to distinguish products 
v/hich are advantageously made into a puree, and those 
which may be made so for occasions, from those which 
ought not to be so treated. 



CHAPTEB XXY. 

CULINARY ESSENCES AND SAVOURY PREPARATIONS 
OF BUTTER. 

The chief amongst the essences is Proust's Essence or Extract 
of Meat, already fully discussed in earlier chapters. From 
almost every kind of meat a special essence might be made 



THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



according to the method employed iu the preparation of 
those of beef and mutton. But as the materials are less 
plentiful, stock essences from other kinds of meat are very 
rarely if at all made. Fmnets are essences containing 
certain specified flavours, from residual parts of animals, e.g., 
from carcases of birds from which the fillets have been cut. 
With regard to such fumets and to all essences of animal 
parts, remember that meat alone gives any extract worthy 
of the name of essence, and a pound of meat furnishes not 
more than about half an ounce, with which a pint of good 
strong broth can be produced. Therefore a gravy from a 
carcase should not be more in weight than the meat yet 
attached to the bones when they are chopped. Bone and 
inner organs contribute next to nothing to any extract made 
from carcases. 

Some cooks apply the name of fumet only to extracts 
made from game, pheasants, woodcocks, partridges, and 
from larks, blackbirds, leverets, and rabbits. This is a 
matter of mere convention, and there is no reason why an 
essence of fowl should not be called a fumet of fowl ; any- 
how, essences are made in exactly the same manner as 
fumets. 

The Essence of Fowl as described in books on cookery is 
a good illustration of the persistence of the prejudice iu 
favour of bones of whatever origin, and is of very little use. 
The compound essence^ into which extract of veal enters, is 
more suitable. The Essences of Game — pheasant, partridge, 
woodcock, and snipe — are useful to work up residues. 

Essence of Ham is always savoury and naturally concen- 
trated, as the meat of the ham has ])een dried. 

Essences of Flsli are savoury, but have a collateral fishy 
or hair-oil taste, which makes them repulsive to refined 
palates. Broiled fish — e.g., John Dory or whiting— gives a 
more tolerable essence, but it is partaken of only under 
social constraint, 



CVLINARY ESSENCES, SOY 3T3 



Essences may be made of shallots, garlic, sage and onions, 
truffles, muslirooms (not to be confounded with hetchui)) , fine 
herbs, oranges, anchovies. 

The essences may be incorporated with butter, which, Hke 
most fats, has the power of retaining flavours better than 
liquids. We thus obtain anchovy butter, ravigote butter, 
green ravigote butter, Provenrale butter, lobster battler or 
lobster coral butter, Montj^elUer butter, crayfish butter, iirawn 
and shrimp butler. In the cases of crayfish and other crus- 
taceans, the flesh itself, not merely the extract, is incorpor- 
ated as puree with the butter. 

Soy, soya, Japanese sooju, also called India or China soy, 
because it came via these countries, is the Japanese name 
of the plant Dolichos soja, L., and of the extract prepared 
from the fermented grain of this plant. The grain or bean 
is (said to be) fermented in (salt) water, and the product is 
evaporated down to the consistency of a thin sauce, or even 
of a dark-brown treacly extract. China soy as hitherto 
obtained in London had a strong taste of brown or black 
sugar syrup, commonly called dabs, and however genuine 
as regards importation it may have been, it would have 
been more valuable if it had not been so mixed. According 
to an old fable, soy is made from beetles, a statement which 
Londoners improve to black-beetles. This w^as probably 
induced by the colour of the soy, which is very much like 
that of the brown articulate. 

The so-called China soy formerly sold in London was a 
thick liquid of agreeable, sweetish, somewhat warm taste. 
The later importations from Japan consist of a thin brown 
liquid of agreeable taste, being a salted extractive, which 
serves any purpose of a mild sauce ; we found it very agree- 
able with fish. 

According to Kasmpfer, soy was made by the Japanese 
with meat- juice, and termed by them sooju; but the products 
sold in London contain no appreciable amount of meat-juice. 



3H THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



The Japanese eat the flour of the soy-bean cooked, and 
call the dish mino. 

Brillat-Savarin supposed that soy had l^een the garum of 
the Eomans : ' Soy which comes from India, and which is 
known to be the result of fishes fermented with mushrooms.' 
This is followed by a sentence of prurient nonsense on 
fishes and truffles, with which this author concludes this 
passage. 

The latropha Plant and its Products. 
A plant largely grown in the West Indies, and supposed 
by the Abb6 Eaynal to have been brought from Africa by 
negroes, by them and the Indians termed manioc or magnioc 
(French manioqne), producing large tubers on its roots, was 
by Linne termed latropha manihot. This name, derived 
from iatron, 'remedy,' d^ndipliago, 'I eat,' is intended to be 
expressive of the properties of different species of the genus, 
which were supposed to be healing as well as nutritious. 
Humboldt termed the plant lanipha manihot. Its roots 
or tubers become very large, and expand even to the size of a 
man's thigh ; their external tint is gray, green, or red, their 
pulp always white ; their juice is milky ; by rasping, leviga- 
tion, and pressure, they yield three products — a imlp, a 
starcli, and a juice. The pulp, when obtained by mere 
comminution of the tubers, and drying, is called couaqiie ; 
when it has lost some of its starch by levigation, and is 
dried, perhaps slightly cooked outside in the shape of small 
thin round cakes, it is called cassava''- (spelled also cassavr 
and cassavi) ; such cassava cakes, with milk, eggs, and cur- 
rants, form an excellent pudding. The mere starch, free 
from nitrogeni/ed, pectin- and gum-like bodies, is called 

* Voce Cassava. Cf. Humboldt, * Plant. .^^2qninoct.,' ii. 108 ; Subeiran, 
Journ. (ie Pharm., xiv. 393 (the poison lost in 36 hours) ; Bajon, ' Mem. 
sur Cayenne," i. 43C (poison passes into distillate) ; Firmin, of Surinam, in 
a letter to Herat and Delens, 'Diet.,' ii. 4S1. Cf. also Aublet's and 
Brunelli's works on Cayer.ne. 



CASSAl'A, TAPIOCA, AND CASS A RIP 315 



moussacJie (iu Cayenne cypipa) ; the former is supposed to 
be a corruption of miicliacho, the Spanish word for ' child ' 
(Merat and Delens interpret ' child of the manioc '). When 
this starch or flour is dried on hot iron plates, it becomes 
cooked and transformed into a body called tapioca. 

The third product of the tubers is the milky juice, which 
in the fresh state is poisonous to man and animals. The 
poisonous principle is either destructible by air or volatile, 
as the juice loses its poisonous qualities within thirty-six 
hours after it has been expressed, and immediately by 
boiling ; the poison passes into the distillate. When this 
juice is condensed to a treacle-like thick extract it becomes 
cassarecj), now to be described. 

Cassareep or cassarip, the concentrated juice of the tubers 
of the lanipha, is not mentioned by any of the earlier 
writers on the subject of this plant, and we may therefore 
surmise that it is a relatively late discovery. It is a brown, 
slightly sweet, aromatic thick extract, which communicates 
an extraordinarily savoury taste to meat-gravies. Its prin- 
cipal value appears in the construction of the West Indian 
Pepper-pot. If this extract be not well sterilized after it is 
bottled, it is liable to pass into alcoholic fermentation, burst 
the bottle, and become lost. The sterilized extract, or ex- 
tract which has fermented, will keep for an indefinite 
period. 

When the juice of the tubers is allowed to ferment by 
itself, it yields a weak spirituous liquid called ouycou, from 
which a spirit can be distilled. 

There is a siveet variety of manioc called camanioc, the 
juice of which is not poisonous, and which can be eaten 
without any other preparation than baking in an oven or 
boilinf? in water. 



3i6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



CHAPTER XXVI. 

VEGETABLES FOR ENTREMETS OR SECOND COURSE 
SIDE-DISHES. 

History and Use of Calery. 

Celeiiy is used in England mainly in two forms— firstly, in 
the shape of young green leaves for flavouring soups; and 
secondly, and mainly, in the shape of greatly-developed, 
etiolated, blanched leaf-stallis, which are eaten raw with 
cheese or salt, and also cooked in soups, ragoiits, stews, 
and stewed by themselves. On the Continent, however, 
besides the young green leaves, the modification called 
celeriac, the greatly enlarged pole- roo^ of the j)lant, is 
mainly used. This furnishes one of the most agreeable 
vegetable materials for various preparations : (a) The roots 
are boiled in broth, and eaten sliced in the soup ; (b) they 
are eaten as a vegetable with white sauce, either being 
boiled in broth first and subsequently dressed, or being 
stew^ed and braised at once in a sliced state ; (c) they yield 
an excellent salad boiled in broth or salt water, sliced fine, 
salted and spiced, covered with oil and a little vinegar. 
They may be mixed with other ingredients, or form a top- 
dressing to other more voluminous salads. 

An entire celeri/ plant, of the kind which forms the en- 
larged and tuberculated pole-root, consists of about 61 per 
cent, of root, 18 per cent, of leaf-stalks, and 20 per cent, of 
leaves ; a root may weigh from 140 to 150 grammes, or 
from 4| to near 5 ounces. The root contains about 84 per 
cent, of water, I'o per cent, of nitrogenized substance, 
0-4 per cent, of fat, 08 per cent, of sugar, 11 per cent, of 
matters free from nitrogen (in this some starch), 1*5 per 
cent, of woody fibre, and above 8 per cent, of ash. The

From this it appears that the stalks are the most succulent 
or watery parts of the plant ; the etiolated stalks are prob- 
ably much more so than were the green ones subjected to 
the analysis stated in the foregoing. 

T\iQ flavour of celery resides in an essential oil, which can 
be obtained by distillation with water of seeds and herb ; 
it is transparent, colourless or little coloured, and has a 
pungent, sw^eetish odour. On account of the volatility of 
the oil wdth water-vapour, dishes containing celery should 
not be boiled longer than is necessary for the cooking of the 
vegetable, or the vegetable should be added at the latest 
possible period. 

Another of the characteristic ingredients of celery (ApiiDJb 
(jraveolcns) is apiiii, originally discovered in parsley, in 
which it is present in larger quantities than in celery. This 
body is a (jlucoside — that is to say, a sugar combined 
strongly w4th another matter, apigeni}i. A solution of 
apiin in boiling water, or a decoction of parsley or celery, 
is coloured deep blood-red by ferrous sulphate, even when 
very dilute, and brownish-red by ferric chloride. Apiin 
crystallizes in needles, and in feebly alkaline solution turns 
the ray of polarized light to the right. Apigenin is a 
yellowish sublimable substance, and contains an aromatic 
radicle. 

Celery, in German spelled Sellerie, is probably derived 
from its Greek name selinon, which Linne used in com- 
pounding the distinctive adjective of its relative, parsley. 
Apium is described as the plant beloved by the bees (apis). 
The older English botanists called celery acJie ; it. has been 



3iS THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

suggested that the terminal ac of celeriac might be a 
survival of this name ache. In some English botanical 
works the name apium is derived from the Celtic word 
upon, wet, watery. The German name for celery i^EppicJi, 
and from the plant preferring wet places it is also called 
palustral or Sumpf-Eppicli. The Greeks used celery-leaves 
for making crowns which were awarded for victories in the 
Isthmian and Nemaean games; the Eomans,* however, used 
it as garlands (mixed with myrtle) round their heads, to 
neutralize, it is alleged, the power of wine. 

We enumerate some preparations of celery which have 
more or less currency in magiric practice. A ragoiU of 
celery-stalks may be varied in several ways ; it should be 
savoury with coulis or broth. Fried celery is produced 
with the aid of a batter. Celeru-stalJcs luith cream, or 
bechamel, is a suitable garnish for boiled fowl. A variation 
is made with veloute. Braised celery with espagnole is very 
tasty ; with allemande, milder. Stewed celery-roots, or 
celeriac, with savoury coulis, is a highly flavoured dish ; 
another form is produced with. Dutch sauce. Celeriac may 
also be excavated, stuffed, and braised. 

Scorzonera, or Salsifis. 

The French consider these roots as a material for soup, 
and when only small quantities of them are at the disposal 
of the cook, this is probably the best use that can be made 
of them. But larger quantities are more suitable for pre- 
sentation as vegetable entremets. There are two varieties 
of salsifis grown— the gray, also called wliitc, and the black. 
Some reserve the name of salsifis altogether to the white 
variety. We beheve that the plant is little cultivated in 
England, but the roots in the market are imported as 
scorzonera.. This is the black scdsijis. It is remarkable by 

* Celery, crowns of : cf. Voss, * Virg. Eck'g.,' 6, 6S ; Orelli, ' Herat. 
Od.,' 7, 24. 



SCORZONERA OR SALSIFIS 319 



containing much asparaijin, a body which bears its name 
from having been originally discovered in asparagus-roots 
and shoots in 1805 by Vauquelin and Eobiquet. This 
nitrogenized substance is found in many plants at different 
stages of their development, most abundantly in young 
shoots of Leguminosas, e.g., bsans, peas, and vetches. The 
scorzonera may be termed the autumnal or wintry 
asparagus ; for although it is a root, and not a shoot, it 
resembles the asparagus much by its chemical ingredients ; 
in flavour, how^ever, it differs again from it. It contains 
about 80 per cent, of water, 1 per cent, of nitrogenous 
matter, 0-5 per cent, of fat, 2-2 per cent, of sugar, 12-6 per 
cent, of other non-nitrogenized matter, 2-3 per cent, of 
woody fibre, and 1*0 per cent, of asb. It is a cichoraceous 
plant ; its name salsifis is of uncertain derivation, but that 
of scorzonera (or escorzoncra) comes from the Spanish 
scurzon, a viper, and the plant bears the adjective liispanica. 
Its early second year's leaves, grown in the cellar, can be 
eaten as salad. 

However intended to be used, the roots have always to 
lie scraped and placed in water to which some vinegar and 
Hour have been added. This prevents the milk- juice con- 
tained in the roots from becoming dark by contact with the 
air. Cut the roots lengthways in four if they be thick, in 
two if they be thinner, and all in lengths of about an inch 
and a half. 

The scorzonera should never be boiled in water, but 
always stewed in a savoury coulis. The French eat 
salsifis prepared with cream, or in fricassee, or fried in 
batter. 

Spinach, or Spinage. 

This plant passes in France by the plural ejnnards ; in 
Germany it is called Sjmiat. It came from Persia, where 
it grows wild, and has been cultivated in Europe for about 



320 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

250 years ; it is a most excellent and useful vegetable, 
available early in spring and summer, and late in autumn ; 
of an intensely green colour, and very fine flavour, which 
amalgamates well with that of batter and gravy ; it con- 
tains a little salt of sorrel^ which is tasted as a slight 
astringency, or as edging tender teeth ; some cooks increase 
this acidity by the addition of a little sorrel. On the 
Continent it is served with fried or poached eggs. Children 
and young persons sometimes have a dislike to it, which 
pedagogic zeal endeavours to eradicate by rigour ; this 
should be avoided, as time and age are sure to transform 
the dislike into respect, and even affection. 

Some German recipes, instead of adding sorrel, pre- 
scribe to dissolve a little carbonate of soda in the water 
in which spinach is to be boiled ; this must be objected 
to. Others flavour spinach with braised onion and bind 
it with a roux ; this is destructive of the fine flavour 
of spinach. Most gastronomers prefer well-boiled and 
pressed, and finely -hacked, spinach with a dressing of 
little butter, or much butter, or with some gravy, or glace, 
or coulis, and with fried or poached eggs, and some 
croutons. The French like spinach with much butter, a 
fact which the authoress * Cordon Bleu ' illustrated by the 
following anecdote : A dignitary of the French Church, 
Canon Chevrier, in order to enjoy his dish of spinach on 
Friday, had it cooked on the previous Sunday, and warmed 
up every day, more butter being daily added to it. She 
also says that, owing to the large quantity of butter re- 
quired by spinach, the French called it la mort an hcurre. 
In England spinach is naturally so constituted that it 
requires and bears only moderate additions of butter. 
Some French gastronomers, in a mood of affected 
pleasantry, have termed spinage Ic balai cle Vhtomac — 
some because of its facile digestibility, others on account 
of its assumed slight nutritious value, Merat and Delens 



SPINACH, ENDIVE 321 

term la rdputation implied by this surname an peu 
usurpee. 

Spinach prepared with butter the French term a VAnglaise, 
that with gravy, au jus. Some make it semi- sweet with 
sugar (au sucre) ; and others, again, transform it into a 
compHcated cream {creme d'cpinards), in which the spinage 
is lost, as opium in theriaque of the French Pharmacy. 
Other forms are rissoles, tourte, and soup. By passing 
spinach through a tammy a tender puree is separated from 
any strings and fibres. 

Extract of Spinach is obtained by expressing the juice of 
pounded spinach, coagulating it over the fire, draining the 
green precipitate on a sieve, and workiug it through the 
sieve with a spoon. It is used for colouring green various 
preparations — vegetables, sauces, quenelles, etc. 

Endive, or Cichory. 

Of endive more than tw^enty varieties are cultivated, all 
of which may be descended from the wild cichory, or 
Cichorium intyhus. Endive is perhaps a corruption or 
modulation of intubus, or intubiwi, the Latin name of the 
blue-flowered wild cichory, as well as the endive of the 
garden. Linne called the latter Cichorium endivia, and 
the former as just stated, introducing a y into the 
cognomen used as adjective. The plant is used under 
many more names, which have multiplied ever since the 
time at which Pliny termed it ambuleia. The form in 
which it is most appreciated is that of salad in autumn 
and winter, when it is etiolated or bleached ; it assumes 
this condition readily when the leaves are tied together in 
a cylindrical bundle. Most excellent endive grows all over 
England, but the endive in the London market is generally 
of third-rate quality and very dear. It may be prepared as 
ragoilt with coulis, or in grand gravy braised, or with ivhitc 
sauce, or cream. When it is stringy, it may be worked into

a puree, and flavoured with bechamel or veloutc, and a 
little sugar. Portuguese cooks even add a little caramel 
to perpetuate its natural slight bitterness, which disappears 
during the processes of parboiling, stewing, or braising. 

Tomatoes. 

The tomato -i:)lant belongs to the family of Solaneae, of 
which the belladonna is a highly poisonous, but in medical 
practice useful, the jJotato a very nutritious member. One of 
the Latin names of the tomato is Solanum lycojjersicicm ; 
another, Lycopcrsicum escidentum vulgare, the edible tvolf's 
Ijeach, popularly love-aiople. It came to us from Mexico 
through the West Indies ; in Mexico, according to Nierem- 
berg, it is spelt tamalt ; but the Malays, who also cultivate 
it, according to Eumphius, pronounce it tamatte. The eat- 
able part is the red, fleshy berry, or seed-capsule ; the 
seeds, with some of the watery pulp, may be squeezed out 
of the fruit with the hand, through an aperture made by 
cutting out the hard central base to which the stalk is 
attached. When the tomato is quite ripe, its red peel also 
is easily removed, and there remains the red succulent 
pulp. A small variety of tomatoes, cultivated more for 
ornament than use, has berries of the size of small 
cherries, down to peas, and these contain juice only and 
no pulp ; their peel, too, is harder than that of the large 
fruit, but they are very pretty as ornamental garnishes to 
savoury dishes, entrees, and ragouts. The raw tomato 
has an acidulous taste of wdld or uncultivated vegetables, 
which is disliked by children, and sometimes by ladies. 
It greatly improves with oil and vinegar as salad, and 
becomes still more developed when stewed, baked, or 
braised. Nevertheless, even these forms are inferior to its 
climax, which is attained in purees, soups, and sauces. 
These must be well reduced, as the fruit is very watery, 



TOMATOES 323 

containing 92-37 per cent, of water, 2-5 per cent, of sugar, 
and about 1-5 per cent, of nitrogenized and 1-5 per cent, of 
non-nitrogenized extractives. Take care to buy only ripe 
tomatoes, and avoid the unripe form wtiich has been 
taken from the bush in the green state, and been forced 
by exposure to sunUght to change its colour to red. Such 
a tomato is always flat in taste and poor in pulp. 

Another Solanum, the nigrum, L., the deadly nightshade, 
called so from the deleterious effect of its black berries, was 
formerly eaten in England as a green vegetable* Its French 
popular name is morelle, like that of its medically so impor- 
tant relative, Solanum dulcamara, the creeping bittersweet or 
Atropa belladonna, D. Another Solanum, of which the fruit, 
coloured dark violet, size of a very large pear, is eatable 
when prepared much like gourd or vegetable-marrow, is the 
one called esculentum, L., known and sold in France under 
the name of aubergine (also milongere, mayenne, varen- 
geane), and eaten in Provence and Languedoc. It comes 
from India, where it is called fohhe-fohhe, or brinjal, and 
eaten in soup and other forms, even as chutney. In the 
Antilles it is called guingambo. 

Of the two alkaloids, atropin and solanin, which are 
poisonous, none occurs in the tomatoes, although their leaves 
are said at certain periods to be noxious. 

Tomatoes form an ornamental and well-tasting entremets 
when stuffed with forcemeat and braised (cl la Provcncale) 
n salad-oil, and gratinated with breadcrumb and the sala- 
nander. 

Artichokes. 

The artichoke belongs to the family of Carduacece. Its 
ystematic name, Gynara, is said to be derived from kyon, 

* While it was, no doubt, prepared, cooked, and eaten as a vegetable, it 
possible that this was done to obtain healing effects. Cf. Gatacker, 
Observations on the Internal Use of the Solanum.' London, 1757. 



324 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Greek for dog, because the spines of its calyx resemble the 
teeth of dogs. Its relative, the cardon, Cynara cardun- 
culus, L., which has served as an illustration in a former 
chapter, comes from Barbary, and is cultivated in Central 
and Southern Europe. Its leaves are etiolated to prepare 
their large and thick petioles for being eaten. (These 
cardons must be distinguished from the cardes, which are 
the petioles of Beta vulgaris, var. Cicia, mangold.) They 
are prepared much like the true artichoke. 

The artichoke, Cynara scolyvius, L., comes also from 
Barbary, and its name indicates its Arabian origin ; for 
from the Arab khar chiof are derived all other names which 
it bears in European languages. It was well known to the 
ancient Greeks and Romans, and cultivated all over Central 
Europe. Its large flower-buds, called heads, contain the 
eatable part, which is excessively small in comparison to 
the large size of the entire plant. This edible part is the 
receptacle or base of the calyx and the calicinal leaves, 
while the centre, called hay, consisting of flowers and silky 
threads, has to be removed. Young artichokes may be 
eaten raw, as salad, but they soon become solid, and then 
require boiling. In any case the calicinal leaves have to be 
chewed or pulled between the teeth in order to extract their 
edible contents. The base, called in French cid d'artichaut, 
is more substantial, and may be cut in pieces for prepara- 
tion. Some dry the artichoke in summer, and in winter, 
after soaking it in water, etc., put it in sauces and ragouts. 
The French artichoke has a nice, particular flavour, but it is 
always a laborious dish. The esteem in which it is held by 
many persons seems to us to be mainly the result of tradi- 
tion; its price in the English markets makes it a fancy 
article, as it is of inconsiderable nutritive value, but a 
source of amusement to the person plucking and sucking 
leaf after leaf, and finishing with the honne-houchc of the 
bottom. 



ARTICHOKES 325 

Aristotle reports that the flowers forming the inner part 
of the artichoke curdle milk. We have tested this, and 
found it correct. The ferment acts like rennet, the ferment 
of the sucking calf's stomach, and the product is the yourt 
— syn. yaourt, or giayourt, of the Eastern nations. A little of 
this yourt put into somewhat condensed fresh milk standing 
in a warm place transforms it also into yourt. This curdled 
milk, or curd [for it draws no whey in its early stages, and 
none at all if the milk be properly concentrated naturally, 
or reduced by heat to a proper consistency, as is pre- 
scribed by Greek recipes which we have perused], is very 
agreeable to eat with a spoon, and very digestible. It was 
used by the Tuscans like rennet for curdling milk, with a 
view to making cheese of the curds. 

The name of artichoke, with explanatory additions, is 
applied to a number of other plants, some of which are 
botanically related to Cynara, while others are not. Thus, 
Indian artichoke is one of the names of the batata, Convol- 
vuliis batata, L. ; earth artichoke, or girasol artichoke, cor- 
rupted into Jerusale^n artichoke, is one of the names of 
Helianthus tuberosus, L., the tubers of which resemble the 
Cynara in taste. This plant comes from Brazil, and has no 
relation to any part of the Levant, and its true name is 
to'pinambur. 

By the production of a number of varieties, white, green, 
violet, red, sweet, large and small, the Cynara has become 
acclimatized over a much larger area than was occupied by 
its original form. The small artichoke, called by the French 
\artichatit a la poivrade, is eaten raw, and, as the expression 
indicates, with sharp sauce. 

From many preparations of artichokes mentioned in 
culinary literature we select only those which have met 
vvith wider acceptation. Artichokes with Sauce is the most 
requently used dish. The dressed heads should be boiled 
n salt water, and those who wish to preserve their green 



326 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

colour should suspend in the water a little bag containing 
woodash, equal in size to a hen's egg, or should dissolve in 
it a pinch of carbonate of potash. The central flowers, the 
aggregate of which is called ' hay,' are removed, after the 
boiling and immersion in cold water, with the blunt end of 
the handle of a small spoon. The artichoke tops are then 
again heated in the salt water, sent to table on a napkin, 
and served with white, blonde, or Dutch sauce. 

Stuffed Artichokes are of four qualities, characterized by 
the nature of the farce placed on their bottoms, and will 
enable the reader to appreciate some of the subtle distinctions 
of French culinary art. The _/9/<:w7i stuffed are in favour for 
fast days, those with rich farce for ordinary use. Arti- 
chokes d la Barigoule also go by the name of a la D' Uxelles. 
They are baked filled with farce, and accompanied with 
Italian sauce. Those d la demi-Barigoide are stewed in a 
savoury coulis, and those d la vraie Barigoule are first fried 
{rissole), and then braised. Artichokes are also fried in 
hatter, being suitably dressed, or in hot batter with savoury 
herbs, French sautes, or baked in oil, etc., a la Provencale. 
The boiled artichoke may also be eaten cold with oil or 
pepper sauce. 

The recipes occurring in French culinary works under 
the titles of Artichauts au gras, d la Lyonnaise, farcis 
a la Grimod de la Beyniere, and a Vltalienne, are all 
contained in principle in the Barigoule or D'Uxelles form. 
Grimod's recipe alone includes massive fried onions in the 
farce for the artichoke, and grated cheese. Nearly all the re- 
cipes ascribed to the editor of the 'Almanachdes Gourmands' 
exult in onions and cheese, and this practice the author of 
the ' Memoires de Madame de Crequi,' an enthusiastic 
magirist, applauded. At that time the French kitchen was 
decidedly deteriorated by what history has shown to have 
been a gust of coarse predilections and idle affectation. 



ASPARAGUS 



327 



Asparagus. 

The name of asparagus is said to be derived from asjjer, 
as many species of this genus are very spiny. This state- 
ment shows the danger of endeavouring to derive names 
from similarity of sound, or subordinate quaUties of the 
objects named. Asparagos is an original Greek word for 
the shoot which rises from the root of the plant called 
asparagia. It has no connection at all with the Latin 
adjective asper, but might possibly be related to the Greek 
aspartos, signifying a plant which grows wild and is not 
sown. Such a name could well be suggested by the 
perennial character of the plant, which is found round the 
Mediterranean, and in its warmer homes shoots twice a 
year. 

The asparagus of our gardens is an improved form of this 
wild shore-plant, and in botany bears the name of officinal^ 
because its roots (not its shoots) were formerly much used in 
medicine as one of the five major aperitives, which were 
combined in a syrup bearing that name. The red berries 
also had similar properties, and their fermentable juice 
was an ingredient of the Benedict Electuary. Only to the 
young shoots pharmaceutical properties were never ascribed, 
while their dietetic and nutritive properties were so highly 
appreciated from the earliest times, that by a generalization 
all edible young shoots of whatever plants were termed 
asparagoi. 

The alimentary use of asparagus was appreciated by the 
ancients, so that Pliny refers to it in glowing terms. Ac- 
cording to him, the cultivation of this plant at Eavenna had 
been perfected so much that three shoots weighed a pound. 
The cultivation of the asparagus occupies a remarkable 
chapter of horticultural science, and has given rise to an 
extensive literature. Out of many prescriptions for the 
preparation of the beds on which the roots are to be 



328 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



planted (after having been reared from seed), we have drawn 
the conclusion that the asparagus plant retains the char- 
acter of a marine littoral vegetable, by requiring, and refusing 
to prosper without, a plentiful supply of common salt in the 
soil around it. 

The great Italian physician and anatomist, Fallopia, 
wrote an exhaustive essay on asparagus, to which we may 
refer our readers for a complete history of this remarkable 
plant. 

The ancients ate the shoots of the spiny-leaved asparagus, 
A. acutifolius, L., which they called corruda. In the East 
Indies the large roots (observe, not shoots) of a particular 
kind of this plant, the A. sarmentosits, are eaten, boiled in 
milk. In Malabar they are used for medical confections. 

One of the principal ingredients of the asparagus is a 
chemical substance, a so-called immediate lorinciple, aspara- 
gin, of which we have already spoken under the paragraph 
on Salsifis, or Scorzonera. It is very nutritious in this 
sense, that it probably is a compound which is used in the 
constructive processes of plants and animals, and is not 
only consumed in the downward metabolic changes for the 
production of power and heat. It seems to stand in a 
particular relation to the albuminous substances. 

Some authors distinguish two cultivated varieties of 
asparagus — the ivJiite and the green. Others admit three 
varieties, the third being the violet. This appears to us no 
valid distinction of varieties, inasmuch as all cultivated 
asparagus plants yield loliite shoots if they are cut before 
having seen the light, violet shoots if cut when just lifting 
the surface of the earth, and gree)i shoots when they rise a 
few inches above the ground. The distinction between 
white and green was well known to the Greeks, who called 
the latter — the only form that could be gathered in nature 
— the high asparagus, asjMragon acron. The high green 
asparagus has the strongest flavour, and is certainly the 



ASPARAGUS 329 



most tender ; the freshly-cut white is tender throughout, 
but becomes woody by being kept. 

An average sprout of the asparagus weighs from 15 to 
24 grm. It contains from 93 to 94 per cent, of water, nearly 
2 per cent, of nitrogenized matter, namely the albicminous 
substances and asparagin, some fat, nearly 0"5 per cent, of 
sugar, and 2*5 per cent, of other soluble organic substances 
free from nitrogen, besides luoody fibre and ash. The 
asparagin forms one-seventh part of the whole amount of 
nitrogenized matter, or of the fresh sprout 0*35 per cent. 

Under the hands of most modern cooks this vegetable is 
now, like cauliflower, almost invariably overboiled. When 
it is immersed in boiling water during twenty minutes, it 
is completely done ; indeed, the high green sprouts require 
even less time. But they are generally heated so long that 
much of their flavour, and a great deal of their cohesion, is 
lost, by the aid of which it can alone be conveniently eaten. 
Hence much of the asparagus served is broken, without 
heads, or otherwise incoherent and painfully mangled. 
Yet boiling is the only mode in which asparagus can be 
usefully prepared. Cooks should therefore remember the 
Roman saying, which became applicable when things had 
to be done quickly : ' Do it in no more time than is neces- 
sary to boil asparagus.' Now, this was evidently not 
equivalent to the twinkling of an eye, but it excluded the 
lingering destruction to which sparrowgrass, as Dr. Johnson 
declared it legitimate to call it, is subjected in urban as well 
as rural saucepans. Dumas properly prescribes : ' Faites 
les cuir croquantes dans I'eau et le sel, et les servez toutes 
chaudes sur une serviette pliee qui egoutte leur eau.' There- 
fore, though fully cooked, the asparagus should yet preserve 
a certain crispness or solidity. It should be served on a 
folded napkin, and not on toasted bread previously soaked in 
the water in which it has been boiled — firstly, because this 
bread does not influence the asparagus ; secondly, because. 



330 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

not being eaten, it is mere waste ; and thirdly, because, 
being soaked, it fails in what we believe to have been its 
original object, when applied dry, as alone it ought to be, 
namely, to suck up as a sippet the superfluous liquid. 

In France asparagus is eaten either with butter or with 
oil, and people sometimes show strong preference for one or 
the other. Fontenelle is related to have had a strong 
liking for asparagus accommodated with oil. His friend, 
the Abb6 Terrason, on the contrary, liked to eat the 
asparagus with butter. The latter came one day to Fonte- 
nelle and invited himself to dinner. Fontenelle, knowing 
the preference of his guest for buttered asparagus, made, as 
he said, a sacrifice of half of w^hat he had appointed all for 
himself ; the Abbe was to have his share in butter, the host 
the remaining half with oil. Shortly before they were 
going to sit down to dinner, the Abbe grew very ill, and was 
seized with an apoplectic fit. Thereupon Fontenelle rose 
quickly, and, running towards the kitchen, called out : ' All 
the asparagus with oil now — all with oil !' 

In culinary works a long list of special preparations of 
asparagus is generally found, but as they mostly begin with 
boiled asparagus, the differences consist in the additions 
or the finishings only, and are mostly unimportant. Practi- 
cally the shoots are eaten in two forms — hot, with butter 
sauce, allemande or Dutch sauce, or cold with oil and 
vinegar. Some eat them hot with gravy, but the practice 
is rare. When the green shoots are cut into short slices, as 
long as thick, they are called asjKiragus i^eas — in French, 
more appropriately, asimragus en petits pois. For the pro- 
duction of such chopped asparagus sj^rue asparagus is to be 
used. The word 'sprue,' used as an adjective, requires 
interpretation. It ordinarily signifies scoriae or clinkers ; 
sprue asparagus therefore, probably, are such as are unfit for 
service as entire shoots, and have to be cut up to hide their 
previous mutilation. A select luxury is Asparagus Faints 



PEAS AND CHICK PEAS 331 



in Gravy. Fried Asparagus involves the upper tv^o inches, 
or less, V7hich are boiled, egged, crumbed, and fried. 
Several ragouts made with asparagus possess no specific 
features. 

Green Peas. 

Green i^cas, the unripe fruit of Pisitm satiimm, contain 
about 80-5 per cent, of water, 5*75 per cent, of nitro- 
genized albuminous — to speak strictly, leguminous — sub- 
stance, 0*5 per cent, of fat, no sugar, but 10"86 per cent, 
of other carbo-Jiyclrates, some woody fibre, and 0-8 per cent. 
of ash. In the ripe peas the water sinks to 14-3 per 
cent., the leguminous nitrogenized matter rises to 22-63 per 
cent., and starch and related bodies to 53*24 per cent. 
The green peas are much more digestible than the ripe in 
any form. 

Green 2:)eas, plain-boiled and dished with some butter, 
are termed a I'Anglaise, and distinguished from the steiued, 
called a la Frangaise. The latter require some bouillon, 
a little sugar, and a roux ; the binding must be added 
sparingly, as when properly treated young peas effect their 
own binding spontaneously. 

Chick peas, or Spanish garhaiizos, are apparently not often 
eaten in the green state. Sugar Peas is a form of peas of 
which the shells are edible, and very sweet, at a period 
when there is hardly any seed developed as yet. These 
shells are stewed just like the young green peas, and are 
very tasty ; they become stringy when older, and then have 
to be sucked or drawn through the teeth singly by the 
eater, or worked into puree by the cook. Marrow-fats are 
a late variety of peas of great size and tender substance. 
China cliilo is a ragout of green peas and mutton, stewed 
with some onions, lettuce, butter, and spices, to be served 
with rice boiled in broth and moistened with butter. This 
is a most excellent dish, and is most conveniently eaten 
with a dessertspoon. 



332 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Green French and Broad Beans and Scarlet Runners. 

Eaw green beans, before the development of their seeds, 
have a decidedly sweet taste. Like cabbage, they undergo 
a fermentation, which, when it is guided by the addition of 
salt and proper treatment, results in the production of lactic 
acid — the characteristic ingredient of sour milk. Such fer- 
mented or sour beans are made and eaten by millions of 
inhabitants of the northern part of the continent of Europe, 
and in Russia are the principal vegetable food, by the 
availability of which throughout the winter the peasants 
produce some variety in their monotonous black bread and 
fish diet, and ward off scurvy. Now, this sweet taste and 
fermentability of beans is due to the presence of a sugar, 
which, as it was first discovered in beans, was called 
jjhaseomannite, from pliaseolus, the Latin diminutive of the 
Greek and Ijatin name for bean, and mannite, the sugar of 
manna, to which it appeared to have some similarity. It 
was next discovered that this was identical with a sugar 
which had been observed previously in flesh, and termed 
inosite ; but what was still more remarkable, it was found 
that it abounded regularly in the human brain. It was 
then observed in small quantities in many parts of vegetables, 
and some sweet Sauterne wines were found to owe their 
taste — at least, in part — to this carbo-hydrate. It crystal- 
lizes, and looks like a diminutive cauliflower. It is not 
capable of being fermented by yeast, but is decomposed by 
the lactic acid bacillus, and can be transformed into an 
explosive, equal in power to smokeless gunpowder. 

Now, seeing that inosite is unquestionably food for the 
brain as well as the muscles, it is right to look to its con- 
servation in our food, and avoid its extraction. Green 
beans should therefore never be boiled, whereby the bean- 
sugar is lost to a great extent in the water ; but should be 
stewed, so as to preserve all their immediate principles. 



BEANS AND HARICOT BEANS 333 

The bean plant is interesting and instructive, not only 
chemically, but also biologically, because of its reactions 
under the influence of night and day. Its leaves droop at 
night and are drawn together, and are raised and expanded 
again with daylight. This action is produced by a special 
apparatus, which is fixed and easily visible at the base of 
every leaf. Thus, there is perhaps some connection between 
the sensitiveness of this plant and the fact that it elaborates 
a nutriment for brain and muscles. 

Stciued scarlet runners (Turkish beans) should always be 
prepared with essence of meat, and their juice should be 
well reduced. French green becms are very insipid when 
boiled in water, but when steicecl with broth become an 
excellent dish. Green broad beans may also be plain- 
boiled, and accompanied with a sauce or stewed. Stewed 
green beans improve in taste by being warmed up, probably 
by concentration. 

Haricot beans are the fruit of Phaseolus vulgaris. It is 
related by ancient writers that the great mathematician 
Pythagoras ordered his disciples to abstain from beans. 
"We have been unable to find any record of the grounds of 
that interdict, and are inclined to doubt the allegation. It 
is probable that the beans received the prefix of haricot 
from their being used in a stew called liaut-ragoiU, gradually 
corrupted to haricot. 

These beans, ordinarily white and dry and hard, have of 
late years been brought into the market, in the month of 
November, in a green state. Many of those which we 
examined had rootlets. When stewed they looked and 
tasted much like the dry haricot similarly prepared. They 
had probably been treated like the barley for malting, made 
to germinate, but simultaneously exposed to light so as to 
become green. 

For the culinary preparation of haricots, it is essential that 
they should be swelled in soft ivater — i.e., water free from 



334 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

chalk and gypsum, or carbonate and sulphate of lime. Dis- 
tilled water is the best. Eain water and river water may 
be used in places ; but when there is hard water only avail- 
able, it should be softened by being boiled for half an hour, 
with the addition of a small quantity of carbonate of soda, 
a lump of the size of a filbert being sufficient for a quart of 
water. Further, the soaking of the beans must be effected 
during a sufficiency of time, not less than eight hours, and 
preferably overnight — i.e., during from twelve to eighteen 
hours. The stewing then becomes an easy process. Broth 
or standard solution of meat essence should always be 
added, as well as some butter ; and the sauce surrounding 
the haricots at the conclusion of the coction should only 
just be sufficient to moisten them, be bound with them, 
and not flowing. With these precautions rigorously en- 
forced, haricot beans are a tasty, agreeable savory — in 
short, an elegant dish, and easily digestible ; they are also 
highly nutritious, and accessible by their price to all people 
who cook. 

The ripe beans of all varieties of Phaseolus contain only 
13-6 per cent, of water ; 23'12 per cent, of nitrogenized 
matters (of these nearly half, 11 per cent., is legumin) ; 
2-28 per cent, of fat ; materials free from nitrogen, mainly 
starch, 53-63 per cent. ; woody fibre, 3-84 per cent. ; in- 
organic matter, as ash, 8-53 per cent. 

Turnips. 
The turnip belongs to the genus Brassica, of the family 
of cruciferous plants. There are several species of Brassica ; 
e.g., the B. campestris, L., much grown for the production of 
oil, and, by a corruption of the German name Eohlsaat, 
called colza. The Brassica rapa, L., similarly yields rape- 
oil from its seed ; but its root, unlike that of the former, is 
eaten. The most important species are the B. oleracea, 
with all its varieties of cabbage, and the one here to be

discussed, the B. nainis, L., turniio — in French navct, in 
German Weisse Rilhe. This plant is of great aHmentary 
use for men and animals. For cooking it is best young, 
but when normally developed is tender and tasty, even 
when of large size and after long keeping in silo or in the 
cellar. Like all the Brassicas, it contains a volatile sulphurous 
oil, which has to be altered or evaporated in part by cooking. 
When turnips are stewed by themselves, they yield an ex- 
cellent, somewhat coloured, product ; but it is somewhat 
indigestible. It is therefore advisable to parboil the turnips, 
and then to stew them, if it be desired to use them as 
vegetable entremets. The ordinary turnip contains 91*24 
per cent, of water, and 4*08 per cent, of sugar; extractive 
free from nitrogen, 1-90 per cent. ; nitrogenized matter, 
0-96 per cent. ; fat, 0'16 per cent. ; woody fibre and cellu- 
lose, 0-91 per cent. ; and ash, 0*75 per cent. 

In some parts of France and Germany, the Brassica rapa, 
or rape, is preferred to the common turnip, and has by 
cultivation — e.g., at Teltow, near Berlin — acquired a more 
substantial tissue. It contains water, 81*90 per cent. ; 
nitrogenized matter, 3-52 per cent. ; fat, 014 per cent. ; 
sugar, 1-24 per cent. ; extractives free from nitrogen, 10*10 
per cent. ; cellulose, 1-82 per cent. ; ash, 1*28 per cent. It 
will thus be seen that in the rape the solids rise to above 
18 per cent., while in the ordinary turnip they are only 
8*75 per cent. ; the sugar is diminished, and its place is taken 
by other carbo-hydrates. Turnips are therefore decidedly 
sweet roots, their sugar amounting almost to two-thirds of 
that of carrots, which contain 2*51 per cent, of cane sugar, 
and 4*23 per cent, of fruit sugar. 

Thus it will be seen that all the soups, sauces, and 
ragouts which have been made with the aid of turnips and 
carrots derive a great part of their taste from the sugar 
contained in them ; another part of their gustatory qualities 
from the extractives, which by heating, braising, frying, or 



336 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

boiling, are capable of yielding principles of agreeable taste 
and flavour, while in the raw state they are somewhat the 
reverse. It is clear, from the saccharine character of the 
turnip, that some increase of the sugar, by addition from 
without in the course of its preparation, may be quite 
harmonious with the whole of its taste. Such an increase 
is made in steiued and glased turnips, k well-done piece of 
turnip in soup or stew is like a sponge, and when pressed 
in the mouth with the tongue against the palate, oozes out 
not only its own liquid, but also the matters and flavours 
which it may have absorbed from the liquid in w^hich it was 
stewed. Gouffe says that turnips should not be boiled too 
long with broth, as they deteriorate the latter by absorption 
of savoury principles. The absorption undoubtedly takes 
place, and therefore turnips boiled in broth are of much better 
taste than those boiled in mere water. But there is nothing 
like a condensation of savour in the turnip ; it abstracts only 
a little broth while yielding some of its own juice and 
extractives. This is all in favour of the turnip, if it be 
intended that it should be eaten ; if it is not to be eaten, 
but to be removed (from coulis, braises, soups, etc.), it 
should be pressed in a cloth in a screw-press, and the juice 
should be added to the preparation to be eaten, if need be, 
after concentration. 

The turnij) may be eaten ijlain-hoiled in sauce, or mashed 
loitli hitter {a VAnglaise), or as iniree. Turniii-sprouts, the 
greenish leaves which they push in spring, called turniio 
tops, are a tender vegetable, and can be eaten boiled in 
salted water with any of the same sauces as accompany 
asparagus. 

Carrots. 

The wild carrot, Daucus carota, L., has a white, strongly- 
flavoured root, which by cultivation becomes yellow, or even 
reddish. It is cultivated mainly in two varieties, one being 



CARROTS 337 



the small early garden, the other the large field root, used 
as food for raan as well as animals. It is distinguished by 
containing a considerable amount of sugar, and a peculiar 
colouring and sl flavouring principle. The water in the carrot, 
on the average, amounts to 87*05 per cent. ; nitrogenized 
matter, 1-04 per cent. ; fat, 0-21 per cent. ; cane-sugar, 
2*51 per cent. ; fruit-sugar, 4-23 per cent. ; other carbo- 
hydrates, 2-60 per cent. ; woody fibre, 1-4 per cent. ; ash, 
0-90 per cent. The larger carrots contain about 4 per cent, 
more water than the smaller varieties. Some carrots have 
been known to contain as little as 1*6 per cent, of sugar, 
with 7*17 per cent, of carbo-hydrates not being sugar. These 
in cooking require an addition of sugar, and then are of good 
taste. The flavouring principle, a volatile oil of strongly 
warm taste and odour, has been isolated by distillation with 
water ; the colouring principle, a remarkable substance 
called carotin, is soluble in the expressed juice of the carrots, 
and can be used for colouring butter, or cheese, or other 
products. 

The most singular feature in the history of carrots is that, 
although they are eaten by man in various forms, stewed, 
boiled, as puree in soups and in ragouts, and introduced 
into most bouillons, consommes, braises, mirepoix, etc., yet 
they are perfectly indigestible, and pass through the 
alimentary canal almost in the same shape as that in which 
they have left the mouth after having been chewed. Not- 
withstanding their indigestibility, they are not known to 
cause any digestive derangement. The great affection which 
cooks and diners have for carrots can only be explained by 
their colour, which makes an impression on the eye, and 
their flavour and sweetness, which speak to the palate. 

Young carrots steiued loith sugar and glazed, a dish in 
French termed a Nivernaise, or the mixture of carrots and 
turnips a la Nivernaise, are favourite entremets or garnishes 
for ragouts. Observe that the pure carrots only form a 

22 



338 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Nivernaise, and that the compound dish is only d la Niver- 
naise. A dish of mere turnips should, therefore, not be 
passed under that name. 

Gourd, or Vegetable Marrow. 

The fruit of the Cucurbitaceae contains from 90 to 95 per 
cent, of water. In the melon this is a virtue, as it produces 
its juiciness ; in the raw cucumber it is objectionable, as 
it dilutes the dressing for salad. A juicy cucumber is, there- 
fore, best sliced, salted, and pressed before use as salad. 
The most watery is the small pumpkin or gourd called 
vegetable marroio. Merely boiled in water it is nearly taste- 
less, and only helps to moisten a dry dish ; but it acquires 
quality by being stewed with consomme or standard broth, 
and dried considerably during the stewing, so as to get its 
juices more concentrated and its taste more pronounced. 
This fruit bore its proper name of gourd up to about 1830, 
after which its present appellation came into vogue. Some 
eat it i:)lain-boiled, ivith sauce; others steived and glazed. 
When stuffed or farcied and stewed it becomes an excellent 
ragout-like dish. 

Cucumbers. 

Cucumbers may be treated, in the same manner as gourds 
provided they be not too thin and sufficiently ripe to easily 
part with their seed-pulp. Steived, and in sauce, after 
previous soaking in salt water and vinegar, called marin- 
ading, they yield a ragout which is very suitable as garnish. 
The juice must be suitably reduced. 

Pumpkins. 

The j^umjjJcin, French j^otiron, German Kilrbis, is used by 
the French with great dexterity for the production of soups, 
purees, creams, tarts, and other entremets. It is a resource 
of the kitchen in many colonies, e.g., the Cape of Good 
Hope, where the Kaffirs almost live upon it at certain times 



rOPINAMBUR 339 



of the year. A immvhin cake is called 2^otiro7i d Vantiquaille, 
and is an excellent compound pudding. Puinpkin pur^e, 
with some liqueur, or with Parma cheese, is very soft. 
Pumpkin, stoved with eggs and cheese is a nutritious and 
wholesome dish. The rich yellow colour of preparations of 
pumpkin is an essential part of their attracting qualities. 

Topinambur, or Girasol Artichoke. 

This plant belongs to the vegetables with compound 
flowers, and is nearly related to the sunfloicer-plant, which 
has the largest blossom of any plant of the moderate zone. 
Its botanical Latin name is Helianthus tuherosus. It was 
brought to Europe from Brazil in 1617, and came to us by 
way of Italy, where, in common with the ordinary sun- 
flower, it passed by the name of girasol, from the suppo- 
sition, not borne out by observation, that it always turned 
the full face of its flower to the sun. As the tubers have 
some similarity in taste to the artichoke flower-head, the 
plant received the name of girasol artichoke, which the 
ability of mankind for the corruption, particularly of foreign 
languages, has transformed into Jerusalem artichoke. To 
this has now been added an extension of the * plant ' 
in the so - called Palestine soup, a puree of topinambur. 
This circumstance reminds of the common belief that 
Jordan almonds, which arrive first, with other dry fruit, 
about Christmas, came from the river Jordan in Palestine. 
But Jordan almonds derive their name from an enterprising 
Englishman who reared and planted them at Malaga, and 
have nothing whatever to do with the East. As regards 
our girasol, we should insist on the preservation of its 
primitive American or Indian name, topinambur. In our 
latitude it is propagated by the planting of tubers, like the 
potato, and the yield is very much like that of the potato. 
The tubers are very varying in quality, because, the plant 
being perennial, they are sometimes left in the ground 



340 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

during two or three years, while the green parts above 
ground are cut and used for fodder. Such old tubers are 
good for cattle but indigestible by man. The tubers contain 
79-59 per cent, of water ; nitrogenized substance, 1'98 per 
cent. ; fat, 0-13 per cent. ; sugar, 4-83 per cent. ; inulin, 
1-1 per cent. ; other carbo-hydrates free from nitrogen, 
9*13 per cent. ; woody fibre, 1'47 per cent, ; ash, 1-17 per 
cent. The 9*18 per cent, of carbo-hydrates consist mainly 
of a principle formerly termed syna7ithrose, but which it is 
proposed to term Icp.vuUii, from its turning a polarized ray 
of light to the left. Inulin, IceimUn and sngar of the topin- 
ambur tubers are said to stand in the same relation to each 
other as starch, dextrin, and grape-sugar. The ash of the 
tubers contains more silica and soda, and less potash, than 
the ash of the potato. The laevulin carbo-hydrates of the 
tubers are transformable into fermentable sugar, and the 
sugar present as such is also fermentable. Some chemists 
have obtained as much as 14:"8 per cent, of sugar from tubers, 
and it was proposed to use them for the production of spirit ; 
but the yield is too varying, and the still will not be a com- 
petitor with the kitchen in the market for this tuber. 

The topinambur tubers when boiled assume a gray, semi- 
translucent aspect, which suggests the condition to be 
expressed by the adjective * watery.' Owing to the solu- 
bility of the ingredients, boiling water must abstract much 
of their quality. It is therefore preferable, whenever 
feasible, to stew them and keep all the principles together. 
This also applies to the flavour, which is strongest in the 
stewed preparation. When boiled, serve the tubers with a 
luliite sauce ; when stewed, accommodate them with Italian 

sauce. 

Batatas, or Yams. 

The name batata of this American tuber has given rise to 
the misnomer ' potato ' which the Solami7n tuberosum bears 
in England. It is also called in its home igname, whence the 



POTATOES 341 



European yam. In botany the plant passes as Dioscorea 
batatas, Ipomcea batatas, and Convolvulus batatas. The 
tuber has a sweetish taste, and is not so attractive as the 
potato ; it is also more pulpy or pasty, so that a baked batata 
has to be eaten with a spoon out of the peel as a bag. It 
contains 75 '78 per cent, of water ; nitrogenized matters, 1*52 
per cent. ; fat, 0*36 per cent. ; matter free from nitrogen, 
20'06 per cent,; woody fibre, 1*07 per cent. ; ash, 1-21 per 
cent. The extractives free from nitrogen are, sugar, 1-73 
per cent. ; gum and dextrin, 2-23 per cent. ; starch, 14*75 
per cent., and other matter, 1*35 per cent. The starch 
made from them is sold in trade as ' Brazilian arrowroot,' 
and serves mainly for the purpose of adulterating the true 
arrowroot. Yams may be steiucd, fried either as they are, in 
slices, or dipped in batter [au beignets). . 

Potatoes. 

The potato-plant is a member of the genus Solanum, or 
nightshade, of which we gave some notes under the head- 
ing of Tomatoes. The early varieties of potatoes grow and 
ripen in from seventy to ninety days after the earthing of 
the so-called seed - tubers, such as those grown on the 
Atlantic Islands, at Malta, and other warm places; while 
the large late potatoes of the moderate zone require 180 
days from the time of planting. Potatoes are frequently 
carried to market in an unripe state, and then are watery 
and not wholesome — at least, not attractive. 

The potato contains in the mean 75-77 per cent, of 
water, or as much as meat ; nitrogenized substances, 1-79 
per cent. ; fat, 0*16 per cent. ; starch, 20*56 per cent. ; 
woody fibre, 0-75 per cent. ; and ash, 0*97 per cent. Of 
the 1*79 per cent, nitrogenized matter, 1*18 are soluble 
and insoluble albuminous matter, while 0*61 per cent, 
consists of asparagin, the substance of which we have 
spoken under Asparagus and Scorzonera, or Salsifis, and 



342 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

of some amido-acids. There is also a small quantity of 
solanin present in the potato, the deleterious substance of 
which a larger quantity forms in the shoots which the 
tubers send out in spring. Solanin is a saccharide, or body 
which by decomposition yields sugar. It is not poisonous 
in the small quantities in which it is ever present in the 
tubers. When more of it is formed, e.g., under the in- 
fluence of the exposure of the potatoes to light, these latter 
assume, besides a green colour, a disagreeable taste, and 
this protects from the consumption of solanin in poisonous 
quantities. 

The introduction of potatoes as a popular aliment was 
opposed for a long time after their first importation by 
Ealeigh in 1585. Even as late as a century ago it required 
the labours of a French physician, Parmentier, to cause 
the last opposition to disappear; and when he was pro- 
posed for the office of municipal councillor, a woman of 
the people opposed him with the words : * He would make 
us eat nothing but potatoes.' 

The tubers are eaten boiled, steamed, baked, steived, fried, 
or sautSes, boiled and mashed, as imree, as dumplings, 
croquettes, or quenelles, in various fancy forms, such as 
excavated and stuffed, or farcied. For some dishes mealy 
or floury potatoes are preferable ; for others, such as 
potatoes in tuhite sauce, or i^otato salad, the less mealy, 
more consistent small Dutch potatoes, or finger potatoes, are 
preferable. On the preparation of potatoes an essay might 
be written for the information of many cooks, to induce 
them to observe the rationale of the preparations which are 
empirically detailed in cookery-books. Those who seek 
excellence in ' a hundred ways ' are sure to miss the easily 
attainable good. 

The Cabbage Tribe. 
SeaJcale, Crambe maritima, is not eaten in its full grown 
state, but only the sprouts of its second year's growth are 



THE CABBAGE TRIBE 343 

used in the white or etiolated state. In this condition it is 
a very neutral vegetable, of a feeble flavour, but agreeably 
juicy. It is remarkable as being a soda-plcmt, so called 
because in its ash soda compounds prevail greatly over 
potash compounds. Such plants are found almost ex- 
clusively near the seashore, or in salty steppes, or near 
salt springs and salt works. Seakale is mostly eaten plain - 
boiled with white sauce, but is much enriched in taste by 
some gravy or coulis. 

The varieties of products of the cabbage tribe require 
much consideration on the part of a magiric writer. 
Bmssels-sprouts and caulifloioer are mostly overboiled in 
common practice, and assume a mashy condition, which 
spoils both their appearance and taste. They must be 
boiled only just so much as is necessary to constitute 
them done, and yet must have left a certain consistency, 
which the French describe as croquant, as we have 
stated above when speaking of asparagus. Brussels- 
sprouts are best with gravy when hot, but when cold are 
suitably accommodated with oil and vinegar. Cauliflower 
associates well with white, or Dutch, sauce ; a more 
accomplished form is obtained with the aid of a fondue^ 
consisting of bechamel or veloute, with Parma cheese, 
butter, yolk, glace, and spices, all stirred in a casserole, 
and poured over the cauliflower. Let this be gratinated in 
the oven until it shows a light colour, and the result will 
be much approved of. 

Savoy cabbage is suitable for many excellent prepara- 
tions, particularly of the savoury quality, and with force- 
meat — steived or braised loitli broth, or stewed with a 
garnish of braised daich, or baked loitli forcemeat, which 
is well disposed of in the interior of the excavated heart 
of the savoy head. Even a schistose arrangement may be 
given to this dish by alternating layers of savoy-leaves 
with strata of farce, and rolhng the whole in an elongated 



344 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



cylinder, which also admits of easy trenching with a 
knife. 

The common green cahhage is also boiled and stezued, or 
braised with farce {a la ravioli) ; the forcemeat may be 
placed into the interior of the head, and the whole tied up 
in a napkin and boiled, or merely held together with twine 
and braised. The savoury preparations unite best with the 
natural flavour of cabbage. 

Bed cahhage can only be made acceptable by stewing ; 
it is never eaten plain-boiled ; it yields an agreeable pickle 
by treatment with boiling vinegar. A little wine added to 
the stewed red cabbage gives it an agreeable flavour ; some 
add puree of apples, others a roux ; a little vinegar is not 
amiss ; also a coulis gives richness to the dish. It should 
be very well done, and improved by being warmed up. It 
is very tasty, but should be eaten in moderate quantities, 
as it requires considerable nervous energy for its easy 
assimilation. 

Fermented loliite cahhage, German Sauer-kraut, was well 
known to the ancient Romans, and in the treatise on 
cookery of Cato of Utica occurs a prescription for its 
preparation ; one of the rustic loriters of antiquity has such 
great faith in its peptic powers that he gives a kind of 
polytrophic advice, namely, to eat a plateful of sour-crout 
for dessert, which would make such quick work of the 
digestion of the dinner just had, that another meal could 
be eaten immediately afterwards. 

The white cabbage is the largest of all varieties of kales, 
and produces heads up to five pounds in weight. To pre- 
vent it from opening at the top, and to keep it close and 
white, it is, if intended for winter use, planted in June, 
and not taken off the field until late in September or 
October. When thus grown it produces in its tissue more 
sugar than any other kind of cabbage, namely, 2 -3 per cent., 
besides 2-6 per cent, other non-nitrogenous matters, mainly 



1 



SAUER-KRAUT 345 



starch ; this starch, when the kale is allowed to become 
frozen and to thaw, is immediately transformed into sugar, 
like a portion of the starch in frozen potatoes, and then the 
vegetable becomes sometimes rather too sweet. Of nitro- 
genized matters white cabbage contains nearly 2 per cent., 
of solids altogether about 10 per cent., and 9 per cent, of 
water. This variety bears the names of Brassica oleracea 
capitata alba, Al. The sugar contained in it consists partly 
of dextrose, partly of inosite ; of the latter we have given 
some account under the paragraph relating to green beans. 

For the production of sauer-hraut the cabbage is shredded, 
mixed with salt in fine powder sufficient to produce a good 
pickle, placed in a vessel, e.g., a barrel, in a compressed state, 
and allowed to undergo the lactic-acid or sour-milk fer- 
mentation ; the sugar is thus transformed into lactic acid, 
and from this the produce derives its name of acid cabbage, 
or sour cabbage, or sauer-kraut. As a preparation for cook- 
ing, the sauer-kraut has to be washed, and thus relieved of 
excess of acid ; it is then to be stewed with butter, or other 
tasty fat, and standard broth, and when nearly done a little 
good wine should be added. There are many variations of 
this process, which mostly result in a somewhat coarser 
product ; there are also many combinations, but the acme 
of all accompaniments, not excepting even roast pheasant, 
is roast partridge loitli sauer-kraut. 

French Choucroute, or Bavarian Kraut, is an imitation 
of sauer-kraut, produced from fresh white cabbage by the 
addition of vinegar. Steep the cabbage in a solution of 
salt in vinegar for some hours ; after that drain and wash, 
and stew as in the previous case. The cabbage, being 
finely shred, absorbs sufficient acid to possess the taste of 
its prototype. The Germans call this forced sauer-kraut.

CHAPTEE XXVII. 

VEGETABLES CHARACTERIZED BY SULPHURETTED 
ESSENTIAL OILS. 

Onions, Shallots, Ciboules, Leek, G-arlic. 

The plants belonging to this series may be defined as green 
condiments, which are occasionally used as entremets ; they 
belong to the gQmxQ Allium, of the family of liliaceous plants, 
hexandria monogynia of Linne. They mostly form bulbs, 
and it is by means of these that they become biennial or 
perennial. These bulbs also are the eatable parts, while 
the leaves, not rarely hollow, are eatable only while young, 
and when coming from particular species. Next to meat- 
essence, the products of coction of these plants form the 
strongest and most frequently employed flavouring principle 
of soups, sauces, ragouts, salads, etc. But they must be 
used with particular caution, as they taint the breath and 
otherwise insensible perspiration of the skin, and thereby 
make the persons who are the bearers of the exhalation 
objectionable to polite society. 

The shallot, dchalote, Allium ascalonicum, is said to have 
been brought to France from Syria during the Crusades. 
Both its bulbs and leaves are eaten. Its essential oil is the 
least strong of all varieties of onions. Some gastronomers 
maintain that it is impossible to make a good sauce ])iquante 
without it. 

The onion, Allium cejxt, L., perhaps indigenous to India, 
is grown in many varieties all over the \vorld, and has been 
so since prehistoric times. Shiploads come to England 
annually from Eoscoff in France. In some countries, like 
Italy and Spain, certain onions are eaten raw and like 
fruit ; but these products of warmer climates are generally 



777^ ONION, LEEK, AND GARLIC TRIBE 347 

of large size and milder disposition than the smaller 
varieties. All onions are made milder by cooking or fry- 
ing, or by soaking them, minced and tied in a cloth, in 
water. The juice of the onion becomes of a rose-colour 
when exposed to air. It contains sugar, passes into fer- 
mentation, and yields alcohol. Its principal flavouring 
ingredient is a volatile essential oil containing sulphur. It 
yields, besides much vegetable mucus or gum, albuminous 
matter and acids, amongst them oxalic, which is deposited 
in the outer harder leaves as oxalate of lime. These outer 
leaves, boiled with water, colour Easter eggs of a brownish- 
red tint. 

The ciboule of the French, Allium fistulosum, L., grows 
tubular leaves, which have an alliaceous taste, and are 
used hashed in sauces, ragouts, salads, etc. It is a kind of 
garlic. Its small variety is termed cihoulette. 

Chives, or civet, or civette, the Allium schoRuoprasum, L., 
German Schnittlauch, is a native of Siberia, a diminutive 
plant, the mildest of the alliaceous tribe ; the thin, small, 
hollow leaves alone are eaten in salads and sauces. 

Allium sativum, L., is the garlic; French ail, German 
K'nohlauch = Knopf -la^ich, or button leeJc. It came originally 
from Sicily. 

The leek, poireau of the French, Allium porrum, L., is said 
to come originally from Switzerland. It is still very 
popular in Lorraine, where it is used for making pies of the 
shape of English fruit-pies. 

The rocambole. Allium ophioscorodon, or Scorodoprasum, L., 
has small bulbs, sometimes multiple, which also grow as 
baby-bulbs amongst the flowers. The bulbs are very sweet, 
and used in place of garlic, because they are much milder. 
In France the rocambole also passes by the name of ognon 
d'Egypte, 

Many marvellous effects and healing powers have been 
ascribed to onion, garlic, and leek, their juices and prepara- 



348 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



tions. Amongst physiological effects it is reported that, 
e.cj.y garlic makes the retina more sensitive, less able to bear 
light. Onion was long believed to be a specific preventive 
of effects of intoxicating drink, or a dispeller of their evil 
effects. At this day onion and garlic or leek are by some 
believed to be specifics against fatigue by hunting, shooting, 
and subsequent feasting. 

There are many allusions to the use of garlic contained in 
classic authors — garlic-sellers, garlic-cake shopkeepers, the 
garlicking of cocks to heat them for combat, garlic-growers. 
Garlic in Greek is scorodon or scordon ; the knobs are 
gelgidcs ; onion is kromyon, which may have led to 
hromesky ; leek is 'prason. The adjective used by Linne for 
the rocambole, scorodoprasum, is also an originally Greek 
word, and signifies a plant of the taste of garlic and leek 
combined. A fabulous people were called the garlic- fighters, 
scorodomachoi. The aversion to garlic, therefore, reported 
as having existed amongst the Greeks was, as in our days, 
confined to the upper classes, and did not affect the lower. 
Dumas describes the very air of the South of France, par- 
ticularly of Proven9e, to be perfumed with the refined 
essence of the bulb of mystic power of attraction, and the 
same perfume is throughout many parts of the Continent 
diagnostic of the proximity of Semitic admirers of the bulb, 
who might have brought the culte to Egypt, or acquired 
it there even without the aid of the Captivity and the 
Exodus. 

The plants of the Allium tribe have yielded some note- 
worthy results to comparative botanical research and 
chemical analysis. The bulbs of garlic are the richest in 
sohds, namely, 35*35 per cent., of which 6-76 per cent, are 
nitrogenized matter, 26*31 per cent, principles free from 
nitrogen ; 64-65 per cent, of the bulbs are water. Next to 
garlic comes the pearl onion, with water, 70-18 per cent. ; 
nitrogenized substance, 2-68 per cent. ; sugar, 5-78 per cent. 



THE ONION, LEEK, AND GARLIC TRIBE 349 

(of sugar garlic shows but a trace) ; other carbo-hydrates 
and matters free from nitrogen, 19-91 per cent. The rose- 
coloured onion contains 85 "99 per cent., and leek 87 "62 per 
cent., of water. The Alliacese contain from 5 to 10 per 
cent, of ash, and in this from 3*46 to 17'72 per cent, silica, 
a feature in which they resemble the graminaceous plants. 

Pearl onions in July weighed on an average 6-2 grm. each. 
Pale red, so-called rosy onions, weighed at the end of 
November 45 grm., while plants from the same field at the 
end of August weighed 19*9 grm. Of leeks, of which the 
average weight had been 45 grm. (15'09 per cent, roots, 
30-18 per cent, bulb, 54-73 per cent, leaves), the practically 
usable bulb weighed in the middle of October 13*6 grm.; 
therefore, out of 45 grm., only 13-6 grm. are available for 
eating, or 30 per cent. Of garlic a compound bulb weighed 
in the mean at the end of December 19-7 grm. 

The alliaceous and cruciferous plants are distinguished by 
active smelling and tasting principles, which are isolated as 
oils. Oil of garlic is obtained from garlic by distillation 
with water, and sinks in water ; it is yellow, very volatile, 
of powerful odour, sharp taste, and reddens the skin. It 
occurs in the roots and seeds of several other plants, mostly 
mixed with oil of onions, and can be prepared from oil of 
7nustard. One hundred pounds of garlic bulbs yield 3 oz. to 
4 oz. of oil. The oil contains no oxygen, but much sulphur, 
and when distilled by itself takes up oxygen and decom- 
poses, but when distilled with water-vapour, or rectified 
over potassium, which absorbs any oxygen, some pure oil is 
obtained. When oil of mustard is heated with persulphide 
of potassium, jjersuljjhicle of allyl is formed, and sublimes. 
It is distinguished by an intense odour of asafcEtida, the 
vegetable gum formerly used in medicine and in cookery. 

Volatile oil of mustard is a product of decomposition of an 
acid, which is present in mustard as potassium salt, and 
passes as myronic acid. It is obtained from black mustard. 



350 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

not from white. It can also be extracted from oil of garlic 
and from oil of asaf oetida. A hundred parts of crushed mus- 
tard-seeds yield from 0-2 to 1-2 parts of oil. The oil is 
colourless, boils at 148 C.°, has a sharp and penetrating 
taste and odour, excites tears, and inflames and blisters the 
skin. 

Horseradish, Cochlearia armoracea, owes its pungent taste 
and flavour to the presence of a sulphurized oil related to 
oil of mustard, but contains only small quantities of it, 
2,000 parts of root yielding by distillation with water 1 part 
of oil. One drop of this oil fills a large room with the odour 
of horseradish. 

Cresses and radishes contain and yield oils related to the 
foregoing, but they are peculiar in subordinate features. 

The volatile oils obtained by distillation with water from 
many parts of cruciferous plants, seeds, flowers, leaves, and 
stalks, are probably mostly mixtures of several oils. All the 
cabbage tribe yield such oils, some undoubtedly garlic oil, 
others oils of pecuUar character. All are sul/phurized, and 
this explains in a measure the loudly-announced phenomena 
of their decomposition. 

The use of bulbs and herbage containing sulphurized oil 
has been much restricted in cookery during this century. 
Kagouts and purees of onions are now made with materials 
previously toned down by parboiling in water. The fine 
Spanish and Portuguese onions also are parboiled before 
being immersed in espagnole sauce. But the puree of garlic 
which was a celebrated dish at the Trois Freres Proven9eaux 
at Paris in the first half of this century, prepared with cod- 
fish, and passing as Morue d la Puree d'Ail, has disappeared. 
Some surmise that it owed its reputation to the mild nature 
of the Provencal garlic, and that had it been made with 
northern garlic it could not have been eaten. 



SALADS AND THEIR MATERIALS 351 



CHAPTEE XXVIII. 

SALADS AND THEIR MATERIALS ; WITH AN AP- 
PENDIX ON VEGETABLES GROWN AND OBTAIN- 
ABLE IN INDIA FOR USE THERE. 

The dressing, or, as it is absurdly termed in French, 
assaisonnement, or, Anglice, seasoning, of a salad was in the 
early days of the century considered by some as a special 
art. This is illustrated by the biography of the Chevalier 
d'Albignac, who is related to have developed from a Koyalist 
refugee into a professional ' fashionable salad-maker,' whom 
the elegant world of the capital of these three kingdoms 
employed in his speciality on all suitable occasions. Unfor- 
tunately for the epigones, the Chevalier has not left his 
recipes on record, so that his performance probably partook 
of the impromptu, guided by memory and graduated gusta- 
tion. But we are allowed a glimpse into his repertoire by 
the list of the preparations which he is related to have 
carried with him in his portable laboratory — vinegar of 
different perfumes, oils with and without 'the taste of fruit,' 
soy, caviare, truffles, anchovies, ketchup, meat gravy, and 
egg-yolks. By the practice of his art and the sale of his 
cruet-boxes, this emigre is reputed to have made a small 
fortune, with which he retired into the Limousin and lived 
in happy retirement. 

The feeling opposed to salad-worship was evinced by the 
man who gave an elaborate prescription for the prepara- 
tion of a salad, which made the mouths of the listeners 
water, but ended with the climax : * Mix the ingredients 
well, and then [in lieu of ' serve '] throw the salad out of the 
window.' From these extremes the art has now happily 
recovered, and observes ih.d,t juste milieu which is so often 
the test of final accomplishment. 



352 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

A salad is a culinary preparation which requires, besides 
salt and pepper or its tincture, oil, or butter, or cream, and 
commonly vinegar. The name is probably derived from the 
archetype of salads, namely, that of cucumber. For this 
succulent fruit ought to be deprived of the excess of its 
juice by a cautious process of salting and iwessure before it 
receives its dressing. Other vegetables have to be prepared 
by selection and ablution, and then to be freed from adher- 
ing water by centrifugal action, swinging in a basket or a 
cloth for the same reason for which the cucumber is pressed , 
namely, to prevent the dilution and loss of the dressing. 

Salads vary with the season, and happily there is in the 
latitude of Europe no month in the year during which a 
special salad could not be produced as appropriate. 

In the dressing of salads care should be taken to avoid or 
limit the use of onions and their congeners. The French 
love a soupqon d'ail, and impart it to their salads by laying 
on the bottom of the bowl a crust of bread on which a 
clove of garlic has been rubbed. But Teutons and Anglo- 
Saxons have less predilection for the flavouring than the 
Latin or Semitic races. 

All salads, after being comminuted by the knife, should 
first receive the necessary salt and pepper, the latter pre- 
ferably as tincture, after that the oil, and be well mixed. 
Some French authors have predilections for particular oils, 
e.g., green oil of Aramont for lettuce, but such specialization 
is difiQcult to practise, and we find that good Lucca oil of 
sweet taste makes a first rate dressing. In the North of 
Europe the salad has always been saturated with oil before 
any vinegar was added ; but the French consider the 
chemist and Minister Chaptal as the discoverer, or at least 
divulger, of this practice. The oil in every salad should 
not only be plentiful, but also carefully distributed, so that 
every leaf has a varnish of it, without any notable quantity 
running to the bottom of the bowl. The addition of vinegar 



SALADS AND THEIR DRESSINGS 353 

should be the last, and should be made with a sparing 
hand. Wine vinegar is preferable to an}'- other, next comes 
vialt vinegar ; least acceptable, though chemically pure, is 
the diluted acetic acid obtained from the products of the 
dry distillation of wood. Some may consider these injunc- 
tions superfluous, but they are either unknown to or un- 
observed by numbers of cooks even in great establishments. 
We have so often seen cucumbers immersed in mere vinegar, 
dusted over with pepper, and oil floating on the top, and 
other similar gaucheries, that we point out anew the old 
well-known rules. 

Many prefer salads with oil and vinegar only ; others choose 
more complicated dressings. Some of these can be kept 
ready in bottles, and are therefore suitable for quick applica- 
tion or oft-repeated use, as in restaurants. They all resemble 
mayonnaise sauce ; one is made with puree of boiled yolks, 
a little milk, and oil or fried butter, salt, sugar, mustard, 
and at last vinegar ; another is made with boiled yolks and 
raw yolks added later, oil, vinegar and spices. These sauces 
or dressings must be creamy, and so thick as to adhere to 
the lettuce or other vegetable. Other dressings have been 
mentioned under the heading of Cold Sauces. 

For Potato Salad the thinly-sliced boiled tubers of suit- 
able, consistent, not floury quality should be drenched with 
good bouillon or standard solution of Proust's meat extract, 
half an ounce to the pint of hot water. No more bouillon 
must be added than the thinly-sliced potatoes will absorb. 
Then salt and pepper, and after them the oil, has to be 
added, care being taken to lubricate the salad with a 
sufi&ciency of the latter. If to this a little good vinegar be 
added, it forms an excellent dish. It may be made the 
basis of more comjjound salads, either with vegetables, or 
with such and fish, or meat ; such compositions have re- 
ceived certain names by which they appear appropriated to 
nationalities, Italian, Polish, Eussian, etc. Of these dishes 
more will be said in subsequent chapters.

354 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Amongst the herbs useful for Salads of Uncooked Vege- 
tables, earliest in spring grows Corn Salad, or Lamb's Lettuce, 
in the fields, self-sown, here and there also cultivated. It is 
the field forget-me-not, Myosotis arvcnsis. When tender and 
dressed with oil and vinegar, it has a nutty taste, whence the 
Germans call it Nilsschen-Salat. In French it is mdclie, 
but it is not used in all the provinces. About Easter-time 
appear the forced lettuces, mainly of the so-called cabbage 
kind, from their globular shape (German, Koj^f-Salat, head- 
salad) ; later on those grown in the open air. Any salad 
made with them is best with a simple dressing of oil and 
vinegar, but bears complicated additions : hens' eggs, boiled 
hard, cut in quarters or discs ; turtles' and ijlovers' eggs, 
marinaded oysters, tails of shriinios, lobster flesh, fillets of 
anchovies, olives filled with forcemeat. Some French recipes 
add a few drops of soy to the dressing. Of all these addi- 
tions, the lobster commands the greatest popularity in 
English society, soy, an otherwise useful sauce, the least. 

The Cabbage Lettuce (Lactuca sativa vericeios) is cultivated 
in many varieties — early, late, green, brown, yellow — but its 
heart should always be white, or merely yellowish ; about 
one-third of its weight consists of succulent ribs, two-thirds 
of green or white thin leaf tissue. Its slightly bitter, 
agreeable taste is due to the presence of a milky juice, which 
contains a soothing princiijle similar in action to opium, 
lactucin. The action of the lettuce in this respect was so 
well appreciated in antiquity, that the Greek physician 
Galen, who practised at Eome, ate of it occasionally daily 
for supper, for the purpose of procuring sleep. He reports 
this himself in his treatise on the properties of aliments, 
and terms the plant ijhilosoi:)her' s, or loise-man's herb. The 
condensed milky juice was termed thridax in France, this 
word being the Greek name of the lettuce itself, and lactii- 
carium in England. It was obtained like opium, either 
by incisions made into the plant, and allowing the juice to 



SALADS OF UNCOOKED VEGETABLES 355 

dry, or by crushing the flowering plant and condensing the 
expressed juice. The Roman Emperor Augustus was cured 
of melancholy by means of the juice of lettuce, and showed 
his gratitude to his physician, Musa, by causing a statue 
of him to be erected in his honour. Opium, being cheaper 
and stronger, and hops in beer have, during the last sixty 
years, displaced lactucarium. The lettuce is not otherwise 
very nutritive, for it contains nearly 95 per cent, of water, 
1*5 per cent, nitrogenized matter, and about 2 per cent, of 
carbo-hydrates. The stiff, straight, common, or Boman 
lettuce has a similar composition, but contains less lactucin, 
and is less tender. 

Endive, C ichor ium endlvico, var. crispa, L., var. ixdlida, 
must be well etiolated, or is bitter, hard and indigestible. 
Its composition is much like that of lettuce, but the fleshy 
leaf ribs contain in addition about a quarter per cent, of 
sugar. There is a summer endive, called Boman, which 
can be blanched by tying up ; but on the whole endives are 
best late in autumn. The harhe de cajmcins is mostly 
grown from roots in the cellar, and is therefore etiolated 
from its growth. Endives should be accommodated with 
oil, vinegar, and spices only, and not be troubled with more 
complicated dressings. 

Waterci'esses, Garden Cresses, Mustard and Cress, are 
refreshing by their stimulant taste, which is due to a 
sulphuretted essential oil, oil of cress, resembling mustard 
oil, of which we have treated above, where also the oils of 
cruciferous plants in general are defined. Many persons 
prefer to eat watercresses undressed, with salt and bread- 
and-butter, or with cheese, or with roast meat. Water- 
cress is the most hardy of winter salads, thriving in floioing 
water (hence by the Germans called sirring ox fountain cress) 
at the average temperature of the earth, in the latitude of 
London about 52° Fahr. Bampion {Bapunculus esculentus, 
L.) is now rarely used or met with. 



356 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



The salads of celery -stalks, tomatoes, cucumbers, gherkins, 
white and black truffles, require no commentaries after 
the foregoing generaUzation. 

Salads of Cooked Vegetables, sometimes inappropriately 
called Boiled Salads. — The salad oi Black Truffles, a laBusse, 
is made with parboiled tubers. Potato Salads are important 
entremets and supper dishes, of the preparation of which" 
the principles have been given above. Never forget to 
drench the sliced potatoes in rich beef -broth. Salads of 
Bed Beetroot, Celery Boot or Celeriac, or the Swiss mixture 
of Bed Beet and Celeriac, of Parsnips, of Sprouts of Hops 
and Asparagus, of Green and Yelloio Beans, being the boiled 
fleshy pods, of Brussels-sprouts, Bed or White Cabbage, and 
Cauliftoiver, are all highly appreciated, and suitable for 
artistic treatment. Compound Vegetable Salads are very 
useful when the single ingredients are insufficient in 
quantity for the required dish. Under such circumstances 
lamb's lettuce may be mixed with sliced potatoes, cucumber 
the same ; an Italian mixed vegetable salad may be com- 
posed of cauliflower, asparagus-points, French beans cub in 
diamonds, new potatoes, green peas, artichoke bottoms and 
beetroot, all dressed with oil, vinegar, tincture of pepper, 
salt, aspic jelly and mayonnaise. Arrange these with fused 
aspic jelly in a plain pudding mould, and if you like con- 
struct a pattern on its outside and arrange the contents in 
layers, close all in with aspic jelly, and refrigerate in cold 
air, water, or ice. Or make a shell of such an aspic and 
put a dressed salad in its centre cavity when it is refrigerated 
and turned out. 

The Spanish Salad of Bread and Vegetables, called 
Gaspacho, occurs in two different forms — that used by the 
rich, and that preferred by the lower classes. It may be 
made with breadcrumb ground or pounded, or — and this 
we prefer — with white wheaten breadcrumb soaked in 
water or broth, and squeezed free from the excess of liquid 



COMPOUND SALADS 357 

by wringing in a cloth ; then add salt, olive-oil, some red or 
green pimentos of the mild character, tomatoes, and vinegar. 
In Spain it is eaten with a spoon made of an excavated 
crust of bread, if a permanent spoon be not at hand. 
Kriisch believed the gaspacho to be a salad of Andalusian 
origin, and it was in Andalusia that we saw it frequently- 
used. The gaspacho of the rich contains, besides the above 
ingredients, marinaded fish, crayfish, or langostinos, piquant 
preserves, gherkins, and aspic jelly ; it has many features 
in common with the Eussian and Polish salads. 

The Salads with Minced Meat originated in Italy; a 
favourite ingredient is cervelat or Bolony (Bologna) sausage. 
Ox-lip Salad has acquired a special reputation. In the 
place of minced meat, the comminuted flesh of fowl, 
turkey, game, may be used. Salads of Minced Fish originated 
with the Dutch, who also made compound salads of such, 
to which Cheddar cheese and various roots and herbs were 
added. The compound Herring Salad has a great reputa- 
tion on the Continent. Of mollusks, mussels, in the par- 
boiled state, furnish a good material for salads ; the shellfish 
should be young, and not exceed two inches in length. 

Amongst tJie Salads made of Crustaceans, Lobster Salad 
takes the first place ; it requires white-heart lettuce for its 
foundation, admits of several appropriate additions — e.g., 
hard-boiled eggs arrayed in various modalities, and of a 
choice of excellent dressings, amongst which mayonnaise 
takes the first place. A pleasing arrangement of a lobster 
salad is en Miroton; the lobster cored may be used for 
tinctorial effect, and plovers' eggs for a garnish, which 
should never be neglected by any appreciator of elegant 
gastrosophy. 

Amongst Compoiuul Salads are celebrated the Italian or 
Anchovy Salad; the German Herring Scdad, as amended 
by Dr. Kitchiner; the Bussian Tunny Salad; the Polish 
Salad, characterized by a prevalence of beetroot. 



358 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

We add a dietetic caution to this enumeration of the 
most acceptable salads — namely, that great care should be 
exercised to obtain all the ingredients of these salads in as 
tender a state as possible to maintain their digestibility. 
Consumers, on the other hand, must be warned to use the 
salads as relishes with the meats and entremets, and there- 
fore in moderate quantity ; this caution is the more requisite 
the more appetizing and attractive are these salads by the 
excellence of the materials or the diversity of the garnishes. 

An excellent herb with which to flavour salads, particularly 
those of lettuce, is the borage — Borago officinalis, L. ; French, 
hourrache — with rough spiny leaves and blue flowers. The 
name borago is conjectured to be a modification of the verb 
corago, I rejoice the heart. 

The use of garlic in salads is as contested a subject as the 
use of these bulbs in general cookery. It is a practice of 
those desirous of imparting a mild garlic flavour to cicliory 
or endive salad to place on the bottom of the salad-bowl a 
crust of stale bread which has been rubbed with more or 
less garlic. This small piece of bread is, in France, called 
a capon {chapon). Of this name some humorous, though 
conflicting, explanations have been given, in which the 
Greek island of Cos, and the county of Caux in France, 
dispute each other the honour of having first produced the 
capon. On the other hand, it is asserted that the chapon, 
consisting of a crust of stale bread rubbed with garlic, 
originated neither in Cos nor in Caux, but in Gascony ; and 
it is surmised that as the Gascons were poor and inclined to 
vanity, it might have occurred to one of them to call the 
crust rubbed with garlic in the bottom of his salad-bowl a 
' capon,' in order to be able truthfully to reply to sympathetic 
friends inquiring after his dinner, or to spontaneously boast, 
that he had dined superbly on a capon and salad. And this 
combination of salad with a piece of bread a humorist has 
alleged to be a good enough dinner for a Gascon. 



USE AND AVOIDANCE OF GARLIC 359 

While the Egyptians, apparently of all ranks, valued 
garlic highly, the higher society of the Greeks absolutely 
detested it. The Eomans, on the whole, used it regularly. 
Virgil speaks of it as useful to the reapers during periods of 
great heat, and Macer, also a poet, believed that it would 
keep serpents away from sleepers. Nevertheless, according 
to Athenseus, the more refined part of society put an inter- 
dict upon its use, which took this emphatic form — that it 
was made an offence to enter a temple of Cybele after having 
eaten garlic. Horace having on the day of his first arrival 
at Eome dined on sheep's head dressed with garlic, and 
contracted an indigestion, ever after entertained feelings of 
abhorrence for the bulb. King Alphonso of Castile had a 
similar dislike ; for when he created a new order of knights 
in 1368, he forbade them to eat any garlic. In our century 
Easpail did yet recommend garlic as a wholesome flavour ; 
and the gall-stone specialist Durand, in recommending it to 
patients, ascribed to it the quality of sapidity, probably by 
a confusion of terms. 

The quantity of garlic which may be used safely so as 
not to make the diner perceptible as a sufferer from culinary 
coarseness is so small that in France it goes by the expres- 
sion of soupcon, or a suspicion. But in Latin countries 
garlic is used broadly. Proven9al cookery is said to be 
based on garlic, and, as already mentioned, the very air of 
the land is said to be perfumed with its odour. It is the 
main condiment of the unmitigated bouillabaisse, and of 
the principal sauces, and, as related of Gascony, the 
' capon ' in the salad in the Dauphine also. Pounded with 
oil, it yields a kind of mayonnaise, aillolis, which the people 
eat with fish and snails. The lower classes in the Proven9e 
flavour their bread by rubbing some garlic on, and pouring 
oil over ic. We once relished garlic of a particular kind as 
garnish to mutton chops while travelling in Spain. Other 
forms share in our taste the sentiment of Greek polite society.

Appendix. 

Particular Vegetables grown and obtainable in India for Use 

there. 

Of so-called country vegetables suitable for cooking iu 
India, the following are useful : Brin']ah (biuegum), the 
fruit of the solanaceous plant already alluded to above ; 
handekai (hhincli) ; greens (bhagee) ; iJodolonghai {chuchoonda) ; 
moringakai (niooringa) ; various beans; country cucumber, 
a variety differing from the European ; small tomato, prac- 
tically only an ornamental toy ; maize {mucka cJiolum in 
Tamil); sorrel ; intmpkin ; yams; large and small onions; 
and stveet potatoes. 

Indian corn, or maize — in Hindostanee boota — is suitable 
for being treated in the American manner, namely, stripped 
from the young pod while unripe and tender, boiled in 
water, and, after having been drained, being tossed in melted 
butter, spiced with tincture of pepper, and salted. Plenty 
of butter is essential to ensure the richness of the dish. 
The corn may be stripped off the stalks after the whole pod 
has been boiled, and treated as just described. 

All country beans, from the Buffi n bean downwards, may 
be cooked, when tender and young, like broad beans {/eves 
de marais) ; boiled, with plenty of salt in the water, till the 
skins crack ; then peeled and tossed in butter ; or they may 
be Vv'orked into a stiff puree. The water iu which the beans 
are to be cooked should be boiling when tliey are put in. 
Madrassee beans may be treated in this manner, and receive 
an addition of standard broth, or glace, or coulis. The 
country greens should be treated like spinach, sorrel, endive, 
or turnip-tops. At Madras, in the hot season, a vegetable 
can always be got called mollay, the tender branches of 
which (mollay-keeray) are edible. It may be treated like 
asparagus, provided the stalks be young and fresh. The 



VEGETABLES PECULIAR TO INDIA 361 

young leaves of this plant can also be used as spinach. 
Youncj loumphins {clil i^ussund), or gourds, gathered when 
they are of the size of ducks' eggs, of an age analogous to 
that of gherkins, may be boiled and served like artichoke 
bottoms. Purees of siceet ijotatoes and yams should be 
accommodated with cream. These tubers may be treated 
artistically by marinading in brandy and lime-juice, dipping 
in batter, and frying. Yams are suitable for several forms 
of treatment which fit potatoes. {Cf. ' Wyvern,' Joe. cit., 
pp. 126, 162 et scq.) 



CHAPTEE XXIX. 

VARIETIES OF FLOUR-PASTE USED IN CULINARY 
OPERATIONS. 

The art of manipulating the flour of cereals with various 
admixtures for the production of several qualities of paste 
or dough is one of the most important achievements of 
human ingenuity. Each form of paste is typical — that is to 
say, different in essential qualities from every other quality. 
When two types are mixed — e.g., in the brioche, or in 
waffles, or in krapfen — a compound form is obtained, in 
which both qualities are expressed in a modified form. 
The progress from the simplest to the most complicated 
form is less evident upon the multiplication of materials 
than by the increase of the manual labour and the skill 
required in its application. 

Flour and Suet Pa\te for Meat Puddings and others is 
apparently easy to produce, but many cooks fail in appre- 
ciating the necessity of adapting details of proportion to 
the special object which the paste is to serve. As the paste 
is mostly boiled, a larger proportion of suet than demanded 
by the standard is not so injurious as an excess of flour. 



362 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Two parts of flour and a little salt made into a rather stiff 
paste, and mixed with one part of finely-chopped suet, is a 
recipe easily remembered. When the suet is diminished to 
one-fourth of the weight of the flour, four eggs have to be 
added to every pound of flour, and as much milk instead of 
water as ^vill make the flour into a thick paste. This latter 
dough can be baked as well as boiled. 

For suet puddings or dumplings others prescribe six parts, 
say ounces, of suet, six parts of flour, two parts of bread- 
crumb, and some salt ; to this a mixture of eggs wdth milk is 
to be added as the liquid — say two eggs upon 6 oz. of flour. 
Tie each dumpling in a separate cloth, which, while wet, 
has been dredged with flour, and boil during one hour. If 
a pudding of 8 oz. of flour and an equal weight of suet, 
2 oz. of breadcrumb, with eggs and salt, be tied into one 
cloth, it requires two hours' boiling. Dumplings may be 
boiled with beef or mutton without cloths, and do not abso- 
lutely require either milk or eggs in their composition ; 
they should be rolled in flour before being put into the pot. 
By the addition of 6 oz. of currants to the paste of 8 oz. of 
flour currant pudding is formed, and by dividing this quantity 
into convenient parts currant dumplings are produced. The 
addition of breadcrumb adds to the lightness of the dough, 
and is made to plain and many fine suet puddings. 

Scalded -Water Paste is used for making the cases for 
cold raised pies. Some butter (one part) is incorporated 
with flour (six parts), and two eggs to each pound of flour ; 
this incorporation is effected with the blade of a knife. 
Boiling water is now added, and when all is incorporated, 
the hot dough is to be worked with the hands until it be 
homogeneous ; it must be so stiff as to stand up in a ridge 
when raised by compression with two fingers. According 
to some the butter may be fused on the hot w^ater and 
together with this incorporated with the flour. 

Gold-Water or French Paste (Pate cl Dresser) is made 



VARIETIES OF FLOUR-PASTE 363 



exactly of the same materials in the same proportion as the 
scalded-water paste, but the water is cold, and consequently 
the butter is not fused ; the paste therefore requires a great 
deal more kneading than the hot one ; the fingers of the 
operator are used as dividers of the paste into flakes, which 
are again reunited by pressure with the palms. 

Short Paste for Hot Pates is also made hke the previous 
kinds of paste, but the amount of fat is much greater, one 
part of butter beiug incorporated with two parts of flour. 
This paste should be kept cool, and not be worked wath the 
hand, but with a knife or a pestle ; for at temperatures 
approaching that of the human body the paste loses its 
cohesion and plasticity, and cannot be rolled out and 
shaped. On account of this, some recipes diminish the 
butter to one part upon four parts of flour. 

Puff Paste or Flake DougJi (Pclte feuilletee) is one of the 
most remarkable achievements of magiric art. A stiff 
dough made of flour, yolks, and water, is stratified with 
cold butter by doubling up and rolling out in such a manner 
that layers of dough of extreme tenuity alternate with 
layers of butter of similar tenuity ; for this purpose the 
dough must be kept very cold, in summer by artificial 
means. 

Sliort Puff Paste is a mixture of equal parts of imff paste 
and short imste ; it is therefore less stratified than i^uff' 
2MstG. The doubling or tripling up and rolling out is called 
in culinary language * giving it a turn.' 

A piece of puff paste a quarter of an inch thick will, 
during baking in a well-heated dry oven, rise to the height 
of two inches, and thus increase its perpendicular diameter 
eight times, while there is no notable increase towards the 
circumference. 

The French pastrycooks call the excavation in the flour 
into w^hich the liquid to be incorporated is placed une 
fontaine {De la Varenne, I.e., p. 168) or une fosse. 



364 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

All these varieties of paste can be made Kith oil, if this 
be freed from its flavour or odour previous to use by sub- 
jectiug it to heat and frying a little bread in it. The 
Spaniards facilitate the use of oil in pastry by raixiug it 
with beef suet ; the mixture acquires the consisteucy of 
butter, and is then incorporated with the flour in the same 
manner as this. 

All the varieties of paste enumerated above were well 
known more than two centuries ago, but they do not seem 
to have been specifically known to antiquity. There are 
apparently no records of the time and place at which flake 
dough was invented, or at least developed. In parts of 
Germany flake dough is also called SjKinish dougli, but no 
ground for this appellation has ever been given. 

Sliort Paste for Pies is made in the same manner and of 
the same quantities of materials as the short paste for hot 
pates. With acid fruit the under side of the pie-crust some- 
times remains pasty and soft, and, from volatile acid, of un- 
attractive taste. To avoid this, some cooks bake the crust 
separately, and cut it in slices and serve it with the fruit, 
but on a separate dish. 

NouiUes Paste has already been referred to above under the 
notes on soups ; remember that this paste contains no butter. 

Paste which is intended to be the material for the orna- 
nientation of ])astry is called Offxe Paste, and is made of 
flour two parts, sugar one part, and (to the pound of flour) 
two eggs and two yolks ; no fat of any kind is added to this 
paste. 

An Almond Paste for Ornaments and Croquantes is pro- 
duced in two stages. Make a puree of Jordan almonds, 
and incorporate with it an equal weight of sugar-powder in 
a casserole over the fire. Produce a solution of gum dragon 
or tragacauth in eight to ten times its weight of water, and 
filter it by pressure through a cloth. Incorporate this solu- 
tion as well as a quantity of finely-powdered sugar, equal 



APPLICATIONS OF FLOUR-PASTE 365 

in weight to the weight of the combined almond puree and 
sugar, with this latter, using both hands for the kneading 
on the slab, until the compound represents a white, stiff, 
smooth, compact, plastic body. The paste looks better if a 
little cohalt blue be added to it. Starch may also be added, 
but the paste then requires double the amount of gum 
tragacanth solution. 

A Starch and Sugar Paste bound by the same gum, and 
coloured bluish by cobalt, is also frequently used for orna- 
mentation. 

The applications of the varieties of paste described in the 
foregoing are numerous and interesting. First we have the 
Vol-au-Vent, a pate case of puff paste baked without any 
contents in its cavity. When such a case is afterwards 
filled with an entree of fricasseed fowl or pigeon, it is fre- 
quently termed ' a chicken or pigeon pasty or pate,' although 
the true pasties are more commonly baked with their meat 
contents already inside of them. The mechanical prepara- 
tion of a vol-au-vent is technically very interesting, and 
requires much skill ; but we must confine ourselves to refer- 
ring to it and to its variation. Care, should be taken that the 
fricassee, ragout, the fish, or other entree, provided to fill the 
pate be of tasty and savoury quality. As the bottom of 
the vol-au-vent frequently remains uneaten, many cooks 
now make it of a common paste. The management of the 
vol-au-vent in the oven is divided into two acts : the first 
ends when the vol-au-vent has risen two inches ; then, and 
before it has acquired any colour, a drum of thick white 
paper, eight inches high and four inches wider in diameter 
than the vol-au-vent, is placed around it to protect its sides 
from any strong lateral radiation, which might check its 
rise or scorch and spoil its colour. 

Tourte Cases for Entrees are also baked blind — i.e., with- 
out their eventual contents — and consist of a mixture of 
puff paste and short paste in equal parts. 



366 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Cases of Puff Paste for Plate Patties — that is to say, 
small or miniature pates, of which each diner takes a 
whole one on his plate — are very convenient products. 
Sometimes the contents are below the expectation raised 
by the promising outside ; they should be savoury, delicate, 
refined, concentrated miniature ragouts. 

Coiiunon covered Tartlet or Dariole or Patty Cases are 
made of common short paste rolled out to the thickness of 
a penny piece, and then pressed into the dariole moulds ; 
their bottoms are filled with a mixture of four parts of flour 
and one part of chopped suet ; when done, the mixture is 
scooped out, and the preparation intended for their contents 
is put into the cavity, and the whole is covered with a 
nicely-coloured baked cover of short paste. Such patty 
cases are sometimes by uninformed writers called crous- 
tacles, a name which is quite inappropriate. These darioles 
are not ordinarily filled with ragouts, but with creamy, 
white cheesy, macroon-flavoured, semi-sweet flour and egg 
materials. If you value quality and its conservation, keep 
in integrity the names of, and traditions concerning, old 
dishes. 

Patty Cases resembling little timhales are made of boiled 
Noiiilles paste, filled with savoury contents tossed with 
butter, and bound with bechamel sauce. They may also be 
egged and crumbed and fried in lard. They are laborious 
but pretty morsels, on which an Italian cook, e.g., can show 
his skill in the art of producing Eabioles. 

Cro2cstades are in French culinary terminology i)astics of 
different sizes for the reception of farcied meat, the paste of 
which is harder or more crackling (croquante) than that of 
vol-au-vent, timbales, casseroles of rice, etc. They are 
mostly made of stale bread, which is carved or turned until 
it has the desired form. This bread is now hned with 
butter, and coloured in an oven, or fried in flowing fat, 
drained of excess of fat, and now constitutes the base, or 



CROUSTADES 567 



mould, or crust of the croustade. This mould now receives 
a lining of puff paste, and with this is baked a second time, 
either with the forcemeat in its interior and the lid or 
cover on, or by itself without any meat in its cavity. 
Croustades may be served with forcemeat only, or garnished 
with boned quails^ larks, or other small birds. Of so-called 
* croustades ' described by some French culinary authors, 
some have no title to this name at all : thus, one named 
a la finaiiciere is a, mere pate; those aux truffes a surprise 
are mere boiled truffles excavated and filled with farce ; 
that a la carcassonne is a mere pigeon pie, of which the 
pigeon has been previously stewed as ragout. 

Croustades are curiosities even for the French them- 
selves, owing to the spelling of their name ; for crusts of 
bread, whether produced during the process of baking, or 
by additional toasting or frying, in French are croutes, and 
the elision of the s is indicated by the circumflex accent. 
How, then, does it come that this s survives in croustades ? 
Perhaps because they are a revival of the Italian crust ini 
and crustadinos. 

Croustades as we have known them attempted in some 
establishments involve two dangers : the first one is waste, 
as the fried bread sculptures mostly remain uneaten ; and 
in the so-called ' ornamental croustades of bread ' are never 
intended to be eaten ; the second one is that in pretentious 
places which cater for the ignorant masses things will be 
served as croustades which are mere commonplace pates, 
and ought to be called so, and not pass under an alias 
intended to represent the unknown as magnificent. The 
croustade is a multiple waste, firstly of labour on the part 
of the cook, secondly of bread and lard used in frying, and 
thirdly of the quenelle forcemeat with which the croustade 
is coated or lined inside, and baked again, before the entree 
is put in ; this hning is to prevent the sauce from pene- 
trating into and through the fried bread. It is much better 



368 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

to send the dishes which may be fancied for production in 
ornamental croustades to table in appropriate vessels of 
ornamental porcelain. Several of the recipes for orna- 
mental croustades which we perused showed very great 
disparity between the cost of the vessel (mainly in labour, 
forcemeat, and fat ; we say cost, for its oxA^ value is what it 
contributes to the pig- tub) and the value of the contents — 
calf's-tail, lamb's brains, fat livers ; such were some of the 
interesting items proposed for rece^^tion and presentation to 
guests in these vessels of perverted bread. To think of a 
Strasburg completely - finished patty being dug out of its 
ornamental porcelain jar, and worried in a sautapan between 
fat bacon, in wine mirepoix, with truffles and mushrooms, 
and quenelles of game, and at last insulted by a garnish of 
a border of double wJiite cocks' combs, is a painful operation, 
and we should advise all patrons of good cookery to dis- 
countenance so useless and, in more than one sense, lament- 
able a waste of natural substance and human effort. 

Italian crustini are circular slices of breadcrumb fried in 
oil or butter, and bearing on their excavated tops a small 
portion of a savoury ragout or mince, and on this a small 
ball of Parma cheese kneaded with butter, a symbol of the 
Indian tortoise bearing the world on its back.

Bread. 

Bread indicates a relatively far-advanced state of human 
culture. According to Cato, the old Eomans had been 
reared upon gruel, and this soup- like preparation was down 
to our days the general or occasional food of entire popula- 
tions. When gruel was superseded by better preparations, 
e.g., porridge, it was limited to the breakfast-table, ultimately 
to the sick-chamber ; it survives in workhouses as skilly. 



EARLY FORMS OF BREAD 371 

Now gruel is boiled, but the poorest Scotch occasionally ate a 
paste of oatmeal and water uncooked/'' and, next to chewing 
the unmilled grain, this Scotch method of eating flour seems 
the most simple mode of cereal feeding of which we have 
any knowledge. 

Simple forms of bread, which by contrast with the more 
developed forms are termed unleavened, are the oatcake of 
Scotland, her i)eas and barley bannocks, the Passover bread 
of the Jews, the damper of the Australian shepherd, the 
American corn-bread, the Indian chuppattee, Spanish tvheat- 
flour cake, and others. The Schmarn of the Bavarian and 
Austrian wood-hacker is also unfermented, but, being fried 
in fat, assumes a particular character. 

Lecovened bread was perhaps first made by the Chinese ; 
it was understood by the Egyptians, from whom the art of 
making it proceeded through the Greeks to the Eomans. 
Leaven held its ground almost everywhere down to our 
present century, when it was superseded in countries with 
advanced culture by the yeast of breweries and distilleries. 
For leaven is inferior to yeast, inasmuch as it acts slowly, 
and gives rise to high-coloured products, which make the 
bread dark, heavy, and acid. 

The bearing of cereals, particularly of their purified meal 
or flour, in the process of fermentation by leaven or yeast is 
a compound process, which is governed by reactions between 
the several components and the ferment, or in the case of 
leaven several distinct ferments. To appreciate this bear- 
ing, and to be able to govern all its details, the baker, no 
less than the cook, must have a knowledge of the ingredients 
of his cereal materials, or, in other words, he must know 
the composition of the flour he intends to use. We will 
pass them in review as briefly as we can. 

* The Scotch mendicant, or poor vagrant, carried some flour in a bag, 
and kneaded the dough for eating in a corner of his plaid. In Polish inns 
omelettes were not rarely mixed in the apron of the hostess, and then 
poured into the pan for frying. 



372 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Of the constitu(i)its of cereals we have to deduct the ivater 
as inert for nutrition, and the cellulose as in the main indi- 
gestible by man. The following are the ingredients serving 
for nutrition : 

1. The Carho-hydrates. — These are the starches, gums, 
and sugars. The plurals indicate varieties, e.g., of starch ; 
for the starch of wheat differs greatly from, e.g., that of 
barley. 

2. The Fats. — These, after eliminating phosphatides, are 
present in small quantities, except in maize or oats, which 
are rich in oil. 

3. The Phosphatides are organic substances containing 
phosphoric acid and nitrogen ; their compounds and modi- 
fications are essential constituents of all nuclei of cells, and 
as such prominent ingredients of brain and nerve tissue and 
of seeds. Phosphatides in flour are of importance in all the 
culinary processes to which flour is subject ; they are govern- 
ing ingredients of eg-yolks, as will be more particularly 
shown under the chapter which treats of eggs. By decom- 
position they yield neurin, glycero-phosphoric acid, and 
fatty acids of various kinds. 

4. The Albuminoids, or substances similar to albumin, the 
white of egg, or such as those of which the blood and tissues 
of animals are constructed. They are termed flesli-formers, 
while the fats and carbo-hydrates are termed heat-givers. 
Both probably yield heat as well as mechanical energy by 
their combustion in the body. 

5. The Mineral Matters, or Salts, Alkalies, Earths, and 
Acids. — These are found as ash on combustion of the 
organic matter. 

TJie carbo-hydrates occurring in cereals are starch and 
dextrine, cane-sugar (sucrose) and maltose, dextrose and 
levulose. They are called carbo-Ji yd rates because in them 
hydrogen and oxygen are found present in the same pro- 
portion as in water, and when all this water is deducted 



CARBO-HYDRATES OF FLOUR 373 

pure carbon only is left. The process by which starch is 
converted into dextrine and maltose and ultimately sugar, 
consists in a breaking up into more simple compounds. 

Starch occurs in the pith of many plants, as in that of 
the sago-palm and the bear-sago of the Cordilleras of the 
iVndes, in bulbs, tubers (such as the potato), in rhizomes, 
and in roots. The cook has to understand and consider all 
these forms of starch, as they behave somewhat differently 
under the same conditions. But for our present purpose 
the starch of seeds is of the greatest importance. 

Diastase, a ferment contained in malt, transforms starch 
into dextrine and maltose. Dilute sulphuric acid does the 
same, but its influence goes further, and terminates in the 
formation of dextrose and levulose. When moist or acid 
starch is heated to between 220^ and 300° Fahr., it is trans- 
formed into British gum or dextrine. Some Vienna and 
Paris and London bakers glaze their rolls by means of this 
reaction; they pass superheated steam into the oven, and 
this produces a small quantity of dextrine on the surface 
of every roll, as shiny as the British gum on the backs of 
postage-stamps. 

Dextrine is of no use to the baker, for in case he have, un- 
fortunately, bad flour or unsuitable ferment, his bread will 
be made dark, and that by the influence of dextrine. This 
colour of bread is only acquired during the baking ; it is 
the result of the influence of heat on the dextrine 
aided by the other ingredients of the dough. Dextrine 
accumulates in the dough in direct proportion to the dura- 
tion of the fermentation ; to avoid, therefore, its injurious 
efl'ects, fermentation must be limited to the shortest possible 
period. And this the baker is enabled to do by the addition 
of some maltose or invert sugar to his sponge as well as his 
main bulk of dough. 

The bakers add to every dough made with flour a certain 
amount of soluble starch in the shape of thin ferment, 



374 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



which is a mixture of boiled comminuted potatoes (in this 
process termed fruit) with ^^east and some flour-paste ; this 
mixture freshens up the yeast and makes it ready to sprout. 
When mixed with the flour for the production of the 
' sponge,' the soluble starch is at once converted into sugar, 
and fermentation begins rapidly. Then the sponge is mixed 
with the whole amount of flour, and the process is repeated. 
The final or third main panification takes place in the loaf 
in the oven, when the temperature of the dough rises to 
that point which is most favourable to diastatic action ; the 
sugar is again as quickly destroyed by the yeast, and after 
a short time all ferments are destroyed by the heat. In 
this process hardly ever any excess of sugar is formed by 
the diastase, none is ever in the bread. Now, it is quite 
clear that the addition to the dough of fermentable sugar, 
such as maltose or inverted sugar, must effect the same 
object as that which is attained by the addition of soluble 
starch, and must accomplish it in a much shorter time. 

In each variety of grain there are several alhuminoids 
occurring side by side, and almost every kind of grain seems 
to possess at least one albuminoid, perhaps several albu- 
minoids, by which it is distinguished from other varieties of 
grain. Wheat-flour made into a dough with water, placed 
in a canvas bag and kneaded, parts with its starch, and 
leaves gluten in the bag ; this is a plastic, tough mass, 
which can be drawn out like shoemaker's pitch ; it imparts 
to wheat - flour dough that peculiar tenacity which it 
exhibits best in the manufacture of macaroni — loitliout 
gluten no macaroni; it also imparts to dough that more 
gentle cohesion which enables it to retain the little bubbles 
of carbonic acid produced by fermentation, and helps their 
shape to be fixed by the baking process; it is thus the 
prime agent in the production of that sponginess which 
makes bread so digestible and so suitable for the most 
varying impregnations. 



ALBUMINOIDS OF FLOUR 375 

Gluten is itself a mixture of at least two albuminoid?, four- 
fifths of it consisting of fibrin, one-fifth of cjlutin. Gluten 
has no taste, is translucent when free from water, and 
insoluble in spirit of wine ; but when it is extracted with 
this reagent, it yields to it the glutin, and the fibrin remains 
undissolved. 

The bulk of the soluble albuminoids of wheat and other 
flour consists of legumin and albumin. The legumin has 
also been termed vegetable casein, as it has some properties 
in common with casein from cow's milk (a cheese is 
actually manufactured from legumin of beans), but the 
name legumin is preferable, as it indicates the fact that it 
is the prevailing albuminoid of the seeds of the leguminosae, 
such as beans, peas, lupins, and others. 

The husks of wheat obtained as bran contain another 
albuminoid (cerealin), soluble in water, precipitated by 
alcohol and acids. During the process of malting a portion 
of the albuminoids is consumed altogether, while another 
is transformed into bodies which have more power over 
starch than the original albuminoids, and as an aggregate 
have been termed diastase. 

Barley contains Httle gluten, and its flour yields a heavy, 
sticky dough ; the barley cakes of the Hebrides are some- 
times like leather. To become good bread, barley-flour 
requires an addition of wheat or rye flour. 

Bye-flour contains still less gluten, and therefore yields, 
with leaven, a heavy, close-grained bread of darkest colour, 
black bread, Schwarz-brod or Pumpernickel of the North 
Germans; its latest known English equivalent is York night 
bread, so called because it had to be baked during a whole 
night. 

Oatmeal and maizemeal also have little cohesion in their 
dough, owing to the want of gluten, and hence yield very bad 
bread. Oatmeal, indeed, is hardly ever used for bread, but 
mainly in the form of mostly unfermented thin flat cakes, 



376 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Bicemeal has, with the lowest amount of albuminoids, 
also the least dough - forming capacity ; it is entirely 
aplastic. 

When wheat-flour is moistened with water and kept at 
the temperature of 100^ Fahr. for periods up to eight hours, 
maltose and dextrine are formed, increasing in quantity 
with time, and the amount of soluble albuminoids (peptones) 
increases ; so that in the best flour the amount of soluble 
matter increases from 0*76 per cent, in eight hours to 9*73 
per cent., equal to an increase of more than 1 per cent, per 
hour. When, as in the inferior flours, maltose and dextrine 
are already there, they only increase in quantity, and no 
new substance appears. 

Many processes have been proposed or tried to prevent 
the formation or arrest the increase of these soluble matters, 
specially of dextrine. One useful remedy was carbonate of 
lime (chalk or whiting, not caustic lime, nor milk of lime, 
or lime-water, which have been added for other purposes) ; 
another was the kiln-drying of the corn ; a third that of the 
flour at 100° to 150° Fahr. ; a fourth was the removal during 
the grinding of the corn of that part called the germ. This 
removal is now effected in many mills, and the isolated 
germs are ground into a special flour, and baked into a 
peculiar bread by themselves, called germ bread. The 
germs contain very active albuminoid ferments, which 
deteriorate the process of panification by the production of 
excess of soluble matter. 

The complete removal of the bran from the flour is desir- 
able, not only on account of the injurious action which the 
cerealin would exert upon the dough by the production of 
materials which darken the colour of the bread during 
baking, but more particularly on account of the complete 
indigestibility of the cellulose of bran by the human intes- 
tines. But though not amenable to healthful digestion and 
assimilation, cellulose is liable to a decomposition, during 



REMOVAL OF BRAN AND WHOLEMEAL BREAD 377 

which more or less considerable volumes of marsh-gas are 
formed. Rough bran, as formerly used, furnished the 
materials for this decomposition less readily than the finely 
pulverized, and acted as a stimulant to the peristaltic move- 
ments of the intestines, whereby the time and opportunity 
for the formation of these anomalous products were limited. 
Indeed, in tender individuals — particularly in young persons 
— rough bran acted as a cathartic, and was used by many 
strong persons in the shape of so-called brown bread as a 
peristaltic persuader. The whole experience of mankind 
was against the retention of the bran in the meal, and the 
grounds against that retention, so thoroughly proved by the 
experience of the baker, and urged by every observant eater 
of bread, were so overwhelming that by common consent 
every possible effort was made to keep all particles of bran 
out of the flour, and whiteness of the flour as well as of the 
bread became the first criterion of excellent quality. 

Under such circumstances arose what may be termed the 
Wholemeal Bread Proposition. Bran contains a consider- 
able amount of albuminoid material, the cerealin already 
alluded to. On the other hand, bread, however excellent, 
does not contain a sufficient amount of the albuminous 
matter to make it a complete human food. Based upon 
these two facts, some persons, amongst them a number of 
ladies in easy circumstances, moved by philanthropic en- 
thusiasm, not unlike that which was exhibited in the move- 
ment on behalf of the bouillon d'os, started the proposition 
that bread should be made more like a perfect food by the 
retention of the bran ; the obvious objectionable effects of 
the silica and cellulose of bran they proposed to overcome 
by grinding it into a very fine dust. Wholemeal bread 
became an object of speculation, but when its realization 
was attempted the proposition proved a failure. It was a 
retrograde movement, and properly met with the un- 
qualified condemnation of all scientific men. We leave the 



378 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

bran to the animals which have hitherto consumed it 
(some, like millers' horses, not without frequent evil effects, 
from the magnesium phosphate contained in bran, which 
forms calculi in the intestines), for they are qualified to 
digest such cellulose as man can under no circumstances 
assimilate. 

The testing of flour for quality is effected with the aid of 
the eye, nose, and hand. It is the better the whiter it is ; 
it must have its peculiar pure smell, free from all strange 
odour, and free from even a suspicion of mouldiness ; when 
a handful is strongly pressed, it must assume the shape of 
the hollow of the hand like a cast, and, remaining lumped 
together, must be capable of being laid flat on the table 
without collapsing. Flour may be tested by a quantitative 
analysis for the amount of soluble cdhuminoids which it 
contains, or which are found in it by a reaction following 
the presence of water. The greater is the amount of soluble 
matter, the less is the value of the flour for bread- making. 
On the other hand, the more gluten the flour contains the 
better. 

We now pass to the consideration of the actual i^rocess of 
bread-making, the most majestic of all food preparations, 
and prototype of almost all the many processes for the pro- 
duction of pastes, crusts, and cakes, which in their turn 
include the greatest achievements of culinary art. 

A sack of flour, the wholesale unit of miller and baker, 
weighs 280 lb. When made into bread it will yield from 
90 to 94 loaves of 4 lb. each, or from 360 to 376 lb. of 
bread. 

The preparation of the ferment, in the quantity adapted to 
the sack of flour, is effected as follows : From 6 to 12 lb. of 
ripe, mealy potatoes are boiled and finely mashed, and 
mixed with water so as to form a thin paste; with this, at the 
temperature of 85^ Fahr., from 1| to 2 \h. of wheaten flour 
are mixed, and to the compound a quart of brewer's yeast is 



FERMENT A TION AND PANIFICA TION 379 

added. In this mixture, which is kept warm in a water- 
bath, all the various fermentations essential to panification 
progress simultaneously : the soluble starch is transformed 
into sugar and dextrine by the yeast and soluble albuminoids; 
the sugar is fermented by the yeast, and the yeast grows 
and multiplies ; the albuminoids pass into simpler, hydrated 
or split forms, hemi-albumins or peptones, or are otherwise 
altered ; all ferments become very active. This process is 
allowed to continue undisturbed for eight hours ; it loses 
its intensity about the fifth hour, as indicated by the sinking 
of its frothy head, and the mixture could then be used ; but 
it is left to complete slowly its final metamorphosis. 

The stirring of tJie sponge, the next operation, consists in 
the incorporation with the ferment of one quarter or one- 
third of the sack of flour, together with as much water at 
85° Fahr. as may be required ; with the water in the ferment, 
the water added to the quarter of the flour at this stage 
amounts to half the water to be employed for the whole 
sack of flour. Now, as this latter quantity is fixed by ex- 
perience at from 60 to 64 quarts, the stirred sponge will 
contain, besides the 8 or 12 lb. of potatoes and 70 or 93 lb. 
of flour and the quart of yeast, from 30 to 32 quarts of 
water, and dissolved in this half the amount of salt to be 
added to the entire dough to be made from the sack of 
flour. The sponge now ferments at the temperature of 
85° Fahr., a degree of heat which must be carefully pre- 
served ; it increases in bulk, or, as it is termed, rises, for five 
hours, and then begins to break, with escape of some gas ; 
it rises again for another (the sixth) hour, and then breaks 
a second time ; now tlie remaining flour (three-quarters or 
two-thirds of the sack), and the remainder of the water with 
the rest of the salt, are added, and the dough is either 
kneaded by man or mixed by machinery. 

The dongh, having been thoroughly well kneaded or 
mixed, is left at rest for an hour in order to let it rise again, 



38o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

and is then cut off and weighed in proper quantities to be 
made up into loaves. They are then put in the oven at an 
initial heat of the latter of from 400^ to 450° Fahr., 
and then heated for about one and a half hours. The 
temperature of the bread rises but little, and only on its 
outside — the crust— above the temperature of boiling water. 

If so-called pressed, manufactured German yeast be em- 
ployed to raise the sponge, from 6 to 7 lb. to the sack of 
flour are required (or 04 oz., or 175 grs., to the pound of 
flour). This pressed yeast acts very rapidly, and therefore 
serves particularly for the production of very white bread, 
fancy bread, and rolls. 

It is a common report amongst the public that bakers 
add potatoes to bread-dough for the purpose of cheapen- 
ing its production, to their own advantage, by this admix- 
ture of less valuable material ; this is entirely erroneous, 
and the addition of potatoes is limited to their perfectly 
legitimate use for the production of the ferment above 
described. 

The tests of good bread are that it should have a flinty, 
light-brown crust, should crack on application of a fracturing 
force ; its crumb or the whole loaf should rise again when 
compressed to a moderate degree ; it should be spongy on 
fracture, and the bubbles of the sponge should be uniform 
in size ; it should be white in colour, agreeable in smell and 
taste, sweet and nutty. 

Panification, then, consists in the transformation by 
ferments of starchy and albuminous matters, the induction 
of an alcoholic fermentation of sugar contained or produced 
in, or added to, the dough, the evolution of carbonic acid 
gas, of which much escapes, while enough is retained to 
impart to the dough ultimately a porous, spongy condition ; 
in this state it is kept by the viscid gluten ; the condition is 
made permanent by heat, and bread is the result. 

The starcJi in bread is partly soluble as starch or as 



VARIOUS KINDS OF BREAD 381 

dextrine, partly fixed or insoluble, but can be made by 
secondary iniiuence soluble entirely. A little alcoliol remains 
in the bread, and evaporates slowly. When it is kept, baked 
bread undergoes a change, by which it becomes stale or 
rough, and thereby less appetizing to most people. This 
change is of some importance in cookery, as stale or dry 
bread is suitable for many operations for which fresh bread 
would be, or is supposed and stated to be, unsuitable. 

Bread contains on an average more than a third of its 
weight in the shape of water. Different observers have 
found in 100 parts 62-8 parts of dry bread to 37-2 of water ; 
63-7 to 36-3 ; 554 to 44-6; 64 to 36. 100 lb. of flour yield 
on an average 135 lb. of bread, the limits of variation being 
between 130 and 137-7 lb. 

The so-called aerated bread made by the process of the 
late Dr. Dauglish is not subjected to fermentation, but is 
raised by air previously compressed somewhat by mechanical 
means. In it but little dextrine and sugar are formed, and 
the albuminoids are not much changed except by the heat- 
ing. Bread and cakes raised by baking-powder are made 
porous by carbonic acid evolved from carbonate or bicar- 
bonate of soda by an acid or an acid salt. Of acids, the 
tartaric is most commonly employed ; of acid salts, the acid 
phosphate of lime, and alum. The phosphate and soda 
mixed intimately with flour produces the so-called self- 
raising flour, first imported from America, while alum and 
bicarbonate constitute the Norfolk baking-powder. 

3Ieat bread is wheaten bread with which a quantity of 
cooked and minced meat has been incorporated, in such a 
manner that it disappears from sight, and is dissolved in 
the crumb. Fresh dough will in this w^ay assimilate an 
amount of meat corresponding to 1 lb. upon 2 lb. of 
flour. It will dissolve much more, up to 1 lb. of meat to 
the dough of 1 lb. of flour, but the bread is not so good. 
The bread is darker in colour than white w^ieat bread, has a 



382 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

fine crust, excellent taste, and is highly nutritious. It 
constitutes, in fact, with a certain amount of fat, a perfect 
food. It is very digestible, and can be eaten and assimilated 
with extraordinary facility by persons who suffer from 
disease or derangement of the digestive organs. It is raised 
with the aid of four-tenths of an ounce, or 175 grains, of 
compressed yeast to the pound of flour. 



CHAPTER XXX. 

GRIDDLE-CAKE, DUMPLINGS, PORRIDGE, MACARONI, 
AND NOUILLES. 

Griddle or Girdle Cakes, and Cluippattees or Stone-cakes, are 
analogous elementary preparations of flour for human food. 
The girdle, or griddle, is a circular plate of iron with a rim, 
and surmounted by a semicircular handle like a carrying- 
basket. The latter is necessary for placing the girdle on 
the open fire and taking it off when the cake is done. In 
respect of the manner in which it is baked on the free fire, 
the girdle-cake is analogous to the pancake. From the 
absence of any covering, we may suppose that the cake, in 
order to succeed, must, like the chuppattee of the Hindoos 
or the fried pancake, be very thin. Its advantages were that 
it could be made at short notice, in small quantity, easily 
repeated, and be eaten hot.* An inhabitant of an English 
town of the present time has probably little inducement to 
bake a griddle-cake, but if he were to become transplanted 

* * Biddy, Patsey's grand-daughter, would occasionally allow us to assist 
her in making griddle-cake. Deb and I took it in turns to knead the 
dough in a brown crock. Oh ! the rapture of handling it, and pressing it, 
and spreading it on a board, and rolling it, and patting it, and cutting 
it in fours, and flouring the griddle, and laying it thereon.' — Ex Croker, 
B. M., ' Pretty Miss Neville.' London, 1887, p. 13. 



GIRDLE CAKES AND DUMPLINGS 383 

to Central Africa, or the Brazils, or the Yellowstone regions, 
he might perhaps draw some consolation and nutriment out 
of so simple a preparation of the gifts of Ceres. 

Dumplings are used in England and South Germany by 
large numbers of the population. Norfolk Dumplings are 
pDpularly used in the county of Norfolk, hence their name."^ 
They are prepared with a dough which is caused to rise with 
the aid of either yeast or baking-powder. 

The Apple Dumpling is reported to have been an intellectual 
problem to a monarch of the last century, who could not 
imagine how the apple got inside of it. It may be baked or 
boiled ; in the latter case the crust must be of suet paste; 
but baked dumplings are preferable. 

Currant Dumplings are made interesting to young persons 
by the addition of currants. The dumplings are best boiled, 
as that way most readily plumps the currants. 

In the case of Fried Apple Dxtinplings, the pulp of stewed 
apples is incorporated with the dough, eggs, etc., as are the 
currants in the previous recipe. The preparation is then 
crumbed and fried. Boiled Apple Dump)lings consist of the 
same mass as the fried, and are suitably made light by the 
admixture of white of egg froth. 

Bavarian Dumplings, German Klose or Knodel, are really 
puddings consisting of bread fried in fat, breadcrumb soaked 
in milk or cream, eggs, butter, some flour, salt, and spice. 
They are boiled in salt water, and dressed with browm 
butter. Another form of Knodel is flavoured with onion in 
its substance, and served with browned butter in which 
some parsley and onion have been fried. 

Grits Dumplings are made with a cooked paste of grits, 
which is used and mixed like the panada in the foregoing. 

* Voce Norfolk Dumplings. Dumas, in his Dictionary, erroneously 
derives the name from ' le Due de Norfolk, lequel I'affectionait [sc. the 
dumpling] beaucoup.' He also gives a recipe which is quite unpractical. 
The Norfolk dumpling is not an aristocratic, but quite a popular dish iri 
the county. 



384 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Yeast or Sponge Dwnplings are made with a fermented 
dough containiDg milk, eggs, butter, salt, and flour. They 
require boiling for half an hour, and are eaten with roast 
meat, fish, or compote. Great care must be taken to make 
them spongy by cautious selection of the yeast and vigilance 
over the conditions of the rising. 

Braised Buns (in Germany called Dampfnucleln), or Steam 
Nouilles, consist of a well-raised rich dough, baked in a pan 
in a shallow bath of milk, in an atmosphere of overheated 
steam. They thus are browned at the bottom and the top, 
and surrounded by a white ring, where the milk protected 
them from radiation. The dumplings are a remarkable 
illustration of the difference between conducted hottojn heat, 
which browns them from below, radiated heat, which browns 
them from above, and conducted diffused heat, which, in the 
shape of, or attached to, steam from the milk, causes them to 
rise, in the first instance above the level of the milk in 
which they are immersed. The white soft rim correspond- 
ing to the surface of the milk enables the dumpling to rise 
even after its convex top as well as its flat under surface 
has been browned. Braised buns have, therefore, for a cook 
great theoretical interest, and their production requires no 
small amount of skill and a good oven. They are the 
result as well as the transmitters of much culinary philo- 
sophy. 

Saxon Green Dumplings fried are an ancient sweet dish, 
the recipe for which was preserved in the family of Baron 
von Miilbacher, quondam Saxon Ambassador at Paris. Its 
antiquity is also testified by the fact that expressed juice of 
tansy is one of the ingredients. The green colour is pro- 
duced by spinach. 

Small Dumplings for Soup are produced from a paste of 
butter, yolk, flour, salt, and spice, and ladled into boiling 
broth. 

Almond and Currant Dumplings are a sweet dish, and, 



DUMPLINGS AND KLOSSE 385 



like the Saxon green dumplings, eaten with a sweet wine 
sauce. 

The distribution of dumplings amongst nations is a part of 
the objects of the topography of civilization. In the county 
of Norfolk dumplings are, so to say, at home. Next in 
reputation are those of Bavaria, called Knodel. Almost the 
same, or similar, dumplings in Suabia bear the name of 
Knopfie. In Austria dumplings go by the name of Nuckerln, 
related to or derived from the Italian niocchi. After the 
late King Frederick William IV. of Prussia had given 
audience to the quondam poet and later revolutionist 
Herwegh, there was published at Berlin a fictitious satirical 
account of the conversation alleged to have taken place 
between them. Amongst other questions, the King is repre- 
sented to have asked, * Has there been a good harvest of the 
knodel?' as if they grew on trees. Herwegh is said to 
have replied : * Thanks, your Majesty, the knodel have suc- 
ceeded very well.' As Herwegh was a Suabian, and not a 
Bavarian, the Berlin literate satirist made a mistake in 
putting Knodel for Knopfie. 

Nockerln, Nuckerln, Italian Niocchi, Vienna Dunip)lings, 
belong to the division of stirred dumplings. The ingredients 
are butter, eggs, yolks, flour, .Parma cheese, salt, and spices. 
The dough is distributed in quenelles, and boiled in broth 
or milk. They may be eaten in soup, or milk, or dressed as 
a sweet dish, or as a savoury one. A third variation is 
griess-nockeln^ which are not rarely given with Hungarian 
gulasch, a ragout of rumpsteak flavoured with pabrica, the 
green or red mild capsicum. Many dishes- of the Vienna 
kitchen bear Italian or Hungarian names, mostly somewhat 
corrupted, like the above-mentioned niocchi to nockeln, and 
the Hungarian dish gulasch just mentioned. Cauliflower, 
which in High German is Blumenkohl, at Vienna is termed 
Carviol. Beans pass as Fisoli (phaseoli), etc. 

Porridge is a preparation of any kind of flour boiled with 

25 



386 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

water, and various additions made subsequently to the 
boiling. Its character is that of a stiff soup. Thin or 
liquid porridge is called cjrud. Porridge in German is Brd. 
The word is derived through middle English forree, through 
Old French, from Low Latin 2^orrata, broth made with leek 
('pornim). The affix -idge (says Chamb. Etym. T>\G\>.) = age, 
arose through confusion with ijottage. A small dish, from 
which porridge was eaten, was called a j^orringer (jwrriger, 
with inserted n). Many Enghsh cookery-books do not 
mention porridge at all, yet it occupies an important place in 
the alimentary history of mankind. Eome, said Cato, was 
reared upon porridge gruel. The vegetarians have drawn it 
from literary oblivion. Porridge, also called stirabout, or in 
Italian imlenta, can be produced with wheatmeal, oatmeal, 
maizemeal, and ground rice. It requires careful stirring 
during its preparation. It can be eaten with milk, treacle, 
butter, and sugar, preserved fruit or grated cheese. To 
open up the starch the porridge must be well boiled, or 
kept hot for some time in a water-bath, after having been 
boiled. Maizemeal requires steeping in water before being 
boiled, and removal of all light floating particles; it must 
be left in water for twelve hours or more, and then boiled, 
or, as it is called by an Americanism, creed, till it be 
sufficiently soft for digestion. 

Cold Porridge is a pudding-like preparation. When this 
dish is made sufficiently thick, or stiff, or concentrated, it 
becomes solid on cooling and standing, like the starch-jellies 
previously described. It may be eaten cold, with cold or 
warm sauce, or be fried, or immersed in milk. 

Phtm Porridge, De la Groute, or Sweet Porridge, is a 
historical dish, as it was made by the Lord of Addington as 
Coquus Begins or Grand Queux, and presented by him to 
the Sovereign at the coronation banquet. Before the coro- 
nation of George IV. (1820) the then Lord of Addington 
(Archbishop of Canterbury) claimed of the Court of Privileges 



PORRIDGE, GRUEL AND SKILLY 387 



that he should have opportunity to serve this dish ; the 
claim was granted, and the Archbishop presented the dish, 
De la GrouU, to the King. The plums in this porridge were 
probably, as in plum-pudding, raisins and currants. 

There figure in cookery-books recipes for Savoury Porridge, 
so called because of an addition of onions. According to 
our terminology, porridge can be savoitry only if made with 
broth or standard solution of Proust's extract of meat, or 
with cheese or mushrooms. Such porridge would be a 
transition to soiq^s containing cereals^ and we suppose that 
these latter will be the forms in which porridge will be 
known to future generations. 

Thin Porridge, or Gruel, is made with water or milk ; it 
requires boiling, and, if knotty, skimming and straining. 
Oatmeal and maizemeal should be steeped in water for 
several hours before being boiled, and afterwards should 
stew in a warm place or water-bath for several hours, to 
become perfectly smooth and soluble. The Yorkshire milh 
and oatmeal does not agree well with all persons on the first 
trial, and should be taken in moderate quantities. 

Gruel may be hound or thickened with a liaison of two 
yolks of eggs to the pint, and then should not be heated to 
boiling. 

In some of the casual wards of the London workhouses 
the gruel given as nutriment to able-bodied paupers passes 
under the name of skilly, a word perhaps derived from the 
name of a vessel used in cooking, called skillet (perhaps 
from Old French escuellette, diminutive of escuelle, Fr. dcuellc, 
from Lat. scutella, diminutive of scutra, a dish or plate, the 
word from which scullery (dishery) also is derived. Hence 
a scullion is a dish-washer. 



388 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Macaroni and Nouilles, or Nudeln. 

While all Italy may be called the home of the macaroni, 
they are particularly well made at Naples from so-called 
Black Sea wheat, and prepared in many different ways, in 
soups, au gratin, as timbales, always accompanied with 
Parmesan cheese. The mass of the population of Naples 
lives upon macaroni, figs, garlic, and iced water. Macaroni 
can be made of wheat-Hour only; this is made into a stiff 
paste, and triturated under heavy rolling stones ; when the 
paste is finished it is pressed through cylinders, and shaped 
either into bands or the well-known tubes. 

Macaroni are eaten boiled with butter, cheese, and other 
garnishes. The first boiling should be carried only so far 
as is necessary to swell and soften them (cJie cresca in coiyo), 
and should be done in wate?' ; the second boiling, to com- 
pletion of the coction, should be done in hroth or milk, care 
to be taken not to overboil them and make them mashy and 
shapeless. We abstain from recording the numerous pre- 
parations of macaroni, which are all governed by a few 
principles. The timbales of the gratinated macaroni are all 
exquisite dishes ; the macaroni harmonize with brown 
butter, Swiss or Italian cheese, tomatoes, bechamel, and 
other sauce, and are always easily digested ; care to be 
taken in the gratination of macaroni. The colouring of 
cheese in the oven has the advantage that it enhances its 
taste and savour ; in this respect it resembles the os7nazome 
of meat, which by browning, that is to say, by the abstrac- 
tion of water under the influence of heat — caramclization — 
also assumes a greater influence on the gustatory nerves. 
But the moment the limit of this action is overstepped, the 
cheese or its browned product assumes a bitter, repellent 
taste, and is the reverse of savoury. For this reason pre- 
parations of cheese should never be deeply browned. 

Nouilles, or Nudeln, or German i)aste, are a preparation 



MACARONI AND NUDELN 389 

analogous to macaroni, the difference being that it contains 
eggs, while the latter do not contain any. It may be pre- 
pared in all the ways in which Italian paste is cooked, and 
has the additional advantage that it can be prepared in the 
house in small and large quantities, on the day on which it 
is wanted or long before, dried and kept in store, whereas 
macaroni have to be bought ready made, and cannot be 
produced in the kitchen. Nudeln can be eaten in (jramj 
soup^ with Parma cheese or Gruyere, with coiills of ham, 
with brown gravy ; they may be garnished Yiiih. fried bread- 
crumb, with brown butter ; they are excellent as entremets 
with roast meat, at times when potatoes are bad or vege- 
tables rare, and then may be made to alternate with haricot 
beans. They may be eaten with dried and stewed fruit, 
and are, like macaroni, under all circumstances a digestible, 
nutritious, agreeable kind of food. 



CHAPTER XXXI. 

SOUFFLES, PANCAKES, AND PUFFS OR CROPLETS. 

All the preparations under this head are made of flour, 
eggs, milk, or cream and butter. Souffl6s consist of mostly 
cooked batters made of some kind of starchy flour, eggs, 
milk, or cream, and butter ; the boiled batter is mixed with 
the eggs, etc., and placed in a suitable vessel, mostly con- 
sisting of tin-plate, and rapidly rebaked. They can ' be 
flavoured with aromatic substances, such as vanilla, ginger, 
chocolate, coffee, or fruit-jam ; but when the latter is intro- 
duced in quantity the souffle becomes a kind of pudding, and 
loses its specificity. Souffles must be light, porous, spongy 
like froth ; as their rising is entirely due to the evolution of 



390 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

steam, they must be brought to the table hot, in the in- 
flated condition, before they have time to collapse."*^ 

As the starch or flour, by the aid of which they are made, 
contributes Httle to the specificity of the souffles, they should 
be named either after the flavouring and characteristically 
prevailing ingredient only, or both the floury base and the 
flavouring should be named. -£/.(/., a chocolate souffle made 
with rice-flour should be distinguished from that made with 
potato-flour, as they taste somewhat differently. The, kinds 
of flour useful for souffles are wJieatflour, ground rice, 
potato-starch, arroioroot starch, tapioca sivellcd starch, tous- 
Ics-mois, and rough ground Italian paste, called semolina. 
The flavour incj may be orange, lemon, orange-flowers, cinna- 
mon, vanilla, ginger, chocolate, coffee, or any kind of essence 
or liqueur. The fruit-jams to be mixed or given with them 
maybe apricots, peaches, nectarines, and all kinds of plums. 
Of fruit, raspberries, currants, strawberries, gooseberries, 
apples, and pineapples have been put in souffles, but their 
addition not only compromises their success, but appears to 
us to destroy their character. Such additions of fruit and 
acid flavours, if desired at all, had better be made in the 
shape of sauce. 

A comparison of souffles with other preparations con- 
taining the same ingredients is not without philosophical 
interest. Thus, pancakes are batter fried in a raw state, 
the frying being their only and final coction, while souffles 
are first cooked and then baked. The former admit of the 
introduction into their body of fruit in substance, such 
as apples, but then receive a new name, that oi fritters ; the 
apples taking the lead, and the batter acting only as a sub- 

* We have collected many excellent recipes for sonffles, the best being 
contained in old family records. For all souffles, cf. Careme, ' Pat. Roy. 
Paris,' vol. i., pp. 349 to 3G5, where the difficulties attending souffles are 
well described. He advises souffles to be made broad, and not high — 
12 inches by 3 or 4 inches high. He also terms every souffle Francais. 
Id., ibid., vol. ii., pp. 169, 317 ('Petits Souffles '). 



SOUFhLES AND PANCAKES 391 



ordinate covering to them. The philosophy of pancakes is 
not easily written, but deserves more attention than is 
given to it. The most elementary pancake, for example, is 
Schmarn, which is the staple food during the entire winter 
and part of the summer of the highlanders of Bavaria and 
Austria. The batter is made with water and salt, and fried 
in lard. Every addition may improve it, but it is remark- 
able how well this simple form tastes when well made, and 
how much more attractive and digestible it is than stale 
bread would be under the same circumstances. 

Pancakes admit of the introduction of vegetable pulps in 
several forms. Thus, grated potatoes, even without a portion 
of tha starch which is deposited when they are grated raw, 
mixed with battei: and fried, form a very characteristic 
dish. 

The analogue of this grated-potato pancake amongst the 
dumplings is the glitscher, or slider, so called by the High 
Germans on account of the lubricated ease with which it is 
swallowed. 

For tJie baking of a souffle the oven should be moderately 
hot, so that the dish gets done slowly ; the batter may be 
put into any shape of earthenware or porcelain, but it is 
best to place it in a form of tin, which can be opened at the 
side in case it were desirable to remove the shape, and 
serve the souffle free. Most souffles should be baked imme- 
diately on, and surrounded by, buttered, larded, or oiled 
paper, and the lateral upright paper should rise much above 
the level of the batter, so that in rising the souffle may be 
contained and not overflow. The form should be well 
buttered under all circumstances, so that neither the batter 
nor the paper has any chance of adhering either to the tin 
or the paper. To prevent the souffle from collapsing pre- 
maturely, it should be placed in its shape upon another 
baking-sheet and surrounded with hot embers, covered with 
a warmed dish-cover, and thus carried to the door of the 



39^ THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



diniag-room. Well-made, fiue-grained souffles do not easily 
collapse, but such as have been badly made and overheated 
soon lose their intended appearance. 

Souffles may be ■ produced with the following principal 
ingredients : 

Potato -starcli flavoured with vanilla, or with ginger, or 
pineapple, apricot, raspherry ; wheat-flour, plain or with 
sour cream, flavoured vfith punch ; wheat-grits, plain or with 
almonds, chocolate, raisins and currants ; rice-grits ov ground 
rice and luhole rice are used for the same kinds of souffles; 
grits import an agreeable granular body to them ; souffles of 
nouilles, potatoes, hroivn bread, with several variations, close 
the list of souffles in which flour is used. 

A series of preparations which contain no farinaceous 
matter, and are perhaps improperly termed souffles, but are 
accepted under that name, are the following : 

They may be made with apples; or apples, biscuits, 
macroons ; or with almonds, white or roasted ; of meringue 
paste flavoured with orange - flower (falsely called biscuit 
souffles). A souffle can also be made quickly of sliced rolls 
with lome. 

Pancakes, French Pannequets, and Puffs or Croplets. 

The name pannequets is probably a corruption of the 
English imncakes, and is not found in French dictionaries. 
Some French gastronomers disapprove of the addition of 
confitures to pancake, but others say that gooseberry or 
apricot preserve was necessary to constitute pannequets, and 
that without this the product was only crepes fines. How- 
ever, crepe signifies a pancake, and therefore is synonymous 
with pannequet. We agree with Courchamps thus far, that 
pancakes, to be relished by their inherent virtue, which is 
great, should receive only slight addition of flavour, such as 
a little lemon-juice and powdered sugar. By strong pre- 
serves they would be overtoned, and their specificity would 



PANCAKES AND KRAPFEN 393 

be extinguished. Crejjc is perhaps related to the German 
Krdpfel, Krapfeu, which in the north of Germany are siso 
called pancakes. 

Pancakes should be fried crisp, and not pasty or flabby; 
for this reason they should not be kept covered, but eaten 
as soon as possible after having left the pan. The batter or 
dough can be fermented like that of waffles, or Kriipfel, with 
more or less butter, and particularly eggs. Herbs may be 
added. In this and other manners pancakes may be varied, 
e.g., by the addition of bruised ratafias, and of cream, by 
spreading apricot-jam over them and rolling them up. They 
may also be made compound by adding over each pancake, 
as it is finished, a thin layer of apricot jam, and over this a 
thin layer of potato-souffle batter, and making from six to 
twelve such layers, and then baking the pile for half an 
hour in the oven. At first sight this dish appears to be an 
overcomplicated Apician preparation, but it may be useful 
under circumstances when the fireplace is crowded and the 
dish has to be ready. Pancakes may be varied by the 
addition of either raw or cooked grated piotatoes ; or of rice 
(Germ., Pieissclunarn) ; or of apples in slices, when they 
form a transition to apple fritters. 

Krapfen, or Kriipfel, or Krdppcl, may perhaps be related to 
the French crepe, pancake (at Berlin Krapfen are called 
pancakes), or it may be a flexed diminution of Kropf, from 
the similarity to the crop of a pigeon. They are also called 
German puffs and croplets. They are the nearest analogue 
to ordinary flat pancakes, but difier in this, that the dough 
is kept stiffer to enable the cook to roll it out, cut and fry 
it floating in fat, lard, butter (ghee), or olive oil. The 
Krapfen may receive, just before being baked, into their 
interior an addition of jam or fruit jelly ; in that case the 
dough may be rolled somewhat thinner, doubled over the 
jam or jelly, closed all round, and baked. 

Krapfen should, when introduced into the fat, at once 



394 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



increase in bulk upwards, and float on the largest side ; they 
should then be completely fried on that side to a light 
brown ; then they should be turned and baked on the other 
side. When completely done, a pale line should run round 
the entire outside of the croplet, indicating the zone to 
which it was completely immersed in the boiling fat. This 
soft zone enables the croplet to rise and expand to the full 
measure of its fermentation up to the end of the frying, and 
thus prevents it from bursting. 

The variations in the production of croplets consist in 
alterations of the proportions of ingredients, whereby they 
become more or less rich. The simple ones are good to eat 
while hot, but lose much quality on cooling ; they are also 
apt to remain doughy inside, and must therefore be fried to 
a darker brown than the richer compositions. 

Scriblita of the Bomans, first described in the work of 
Cato of Utica, * De Re rustica,' consists of two doughs, one 
fermented and spongy, and a second one prepared with 
butter and eggs. When both are ready they are mixed and 
kept liquid like pancake batter ; this is allowed to run in a 
thin stream from a large ladle into the fat, and, assuming 
all kinds of fanciful shapes, is quickly baked and removed. 
As some parts are very thin and quickly done, the colour of 
the whole must be kept rather light. This is the oldest 
illustration of double dough preparations, of which the most 
important ones handed down to us by our forefathers are 
wafdes, Kugelhopfe, croplets, brioches, and best pancakes. 
Of these, the waffles are fried between two hot iron plates, 
the pancake on an iron plate, i.e., a pan, in more fat than 
the waffles ; the Kugelhopfe and brioche are baked in the 
oven, the croplets and scriblita in flowing fat. 



PHILOSOPHY OF CAKES 395 



CHAPTEE XXXII. 

THE PHILOSOPHY OF CAKES. 

Cakes are essentially forms of refined, intensified, sweetened, 
fiavoured, and ornamented bread. They are baked for the 
joyful occasion, the social gathering, the feast. In their 
history is summed up an amount of ingenuity, the mere 
tracing of which affords to the philosophical inquirer after 
the development of human affairs the greatest intellectual 
pleasure. From the Catonian j^lacenta down to the modern 
brioche, cakes signalize an evolution of culture, and, like 
confectionery, or including it, are a measure of culture. 
Their variety is as great as it is pleasing, and any attempt 
at the production of novelty has, in our opinion, very small 
chance of success, particularly after the acknowledgment 
of Careme that he had failed in it. The duty of the present 
generation and of their descendants with regard to cakes is 
probably exclusively one of conservancy, namely, to main- 
tain the characteristic inventions in their purity, and not to 
allow them to be deteriorated or lost by equivocal changes 
or additions. Most cultured nations possess cakes which are 
peculiar to them, and all such cakes have certain funda- 
mental analogies with each other, without being derivable 
from each other. This will be seen by a comparison of 
brioche, baba, ratan cake, Savoy cake, and BatJi buns. The 
introduction of fruit gives rise to highly-tasty products and 
innumerable variations, and thus, with spices, a cake 
becomes a miniature abstract of some of the finest products 
of the earth. 

In French a cake is called gateau, and is defined as a kind 
of pastry, mostly round in shape, and made of flour, eggs, 
and butter. Dumas supposes the name to be derived from 



396 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



the prodigality with which children are spoiled (gates) by 
the indiscriminate distribution of cakes as rewards or 
gastronomic encouragements. We believe this surmise to be 
a mere pleasantry. The most renowned of cakes in France 
is the Cidteaii dcs liois, or Cake of the Three Kings, in which 
a beau is concealed. On the day of Epiphany friends and 
families assemble to draw the kings — that is to say, to draw 
a piece of a cake divided into as many pieces as persons are 
present, and he who gets the concealed bean is deemed par- 
ticularly lucky for all futurity. In certain parts the cake 
is cut into so many pieces that there is a piece in excess of 
the number of drawers. This is called the yart du bon Dieit, 
and is given to the first poor mendicant or wayfarer. 

The name of the remarkable cake called Brioche is alleged 
by Dumas to be derived from the fromage de Brie, which 
he states had formerly entered upon its composition. But 
there is not the slightest proof for this surmise ; on the 
contrary, from the comparison of analogous pastries, and 
the actual character of the thing itself, we believe that no 
chees3 of any kind was ever used in the composition of the 
brioche proper, and that its name, like many other names 
of original invention, is shrouded in mystery. This conclu- 
sion is not weakened, but confirmed, by the fact that at the 
beginning of the century a French culinary faddist mixed 
cheese, not of Brie, but of Gruyere, with brioche paste, and 
termed the ultimate product hrioclie au fromage. In Dumas's 
Dictionary the brioche receives certain adjectives, which we 
have not seen in any noted work on French pastry, such as 
fine and royale, also mousseline. The latter term is said to 
be used by patisseurs, but we think them all quite unneces- 
sary, and signifying nothing, as there is but one brioche, 
the beauty and perfection of which should be maintained 
unscathed and unmixed for all time to come. 

The brioche is one of the six remarkable cakes or cake- 
like productions which are compounded of a fermeuted 



BRIOCHE, PLAIN AND COMPOUND 397 

dougli and a butter -and- egg stirred dough, which are mixed 
and doubled up a great number of times to produce the 
greatest amount of useful sponginess. When the brioche is 
intended to serve as a apiece de fond, and be of large size, it 
should be baked in a buttered paper case. It is best eaten 
hot with the early coffee, and should be broken with the 
fingers or a silver fork. The preparation of the dough, and 
the adaptation of the shape to the size, and the modes of 
baking the various sizes, are all evidence of the care and 
ingenuity which has to be bestowed upon it ; the baking, 
e.g., has to avoid two extreme faults — namely, that the 
interior shall not be underbaked, and that the exterior shall 
not be scorched, and not be burst in the rising. When it is 
intended to use the brioche as fancy bread, or sell it in 
definite portions, it may be moulded in diminutive shapes, 
in conical tins, dariole forms, or fancy shapes, such as 
twisted masses, rings, twisted rings like the torta of Rome, 
fingers, and others. For small comijound fancy brioches for 
parties some confectioners introduce into the dough dried 
cherries, candied peel, pineapple, angelica, and some liqueur. 
Of this compound dough they make a ball as nucleus, and 
surround it with a shell of dough free from these in- 
gredients. 

A recipe for a Brioche icith Cheese has been given by Cour- 
champs, but it is in parts somewhat obscure in consequence 
of the overcrowding of expressions. The result of the 
execution of the recipe will certainly be tasty, but, owing to 
the large amount of hidden fat, and the general richness of 
the ingredients, it will call for a vigorous digestion. 
Dr. Ignotus would have said that it was full of gout. 

Under the name of Briochines Vertes occur in French 
works recipes for the dumplings brought from Saxony to 
France by Baron Miilbacher, a former Saxon ambassador. 
We have classified them as what they are, as their fancy 
name is misleading. 



398 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Careme, in his ' Patissier Eoyal Parisien ' (i. 34), said of 
the true brioche : ' C'est une bonne chose qu'ane brioche 
bien faite et mangee chaude.' 

Kugelliopfe is the German counterpart of the French 
brioche, and passes in French cuHnary works under the 
name of cougloff a V allema/iide. The best recipe is that 
given by Careme, who obtained it from Eugen Wolf, cook of 
Fiirst Schwarzenberg, as producing the best Vienna make, 
and beheved it to be an enriclimejit of the grand French 
national patisserie.'^ 

Variations of Kugelhopfe (also termed Kugelhupfm Austria 
and Bavaria) are obtained by additions. EngUsh recipes 
add Jordan almonds. A ^vQuch Parisian Cake is essentially 
a Kugelhopfe with the addition of pistachios, almonds, or 
candied orange peel. Another compound Kugelhopfe has 
been called Victoria Cake, its only peculiarity being dried 
cherries and cinnamon. A royal cook served this cake hot 
as a second course remove, with hot sauce made of apricot 
jam diluted with lemon-juice or with German custard and 
wine sauce. 

The Baha is a cake of Polish origin, and, according to the 
Countess Eisleff, nee Countess Potoka, and related to King 
Stanislas Leczinsky, the father-in-law of Louis XV., ought 
strictly to be made with rye-flour and moistened with sweet 
wine of Hungary. But it has now been assimilated to the 
great cakes of the cultured nations, and, like them, is made 
with wheaten flour. It should whenever practicable be made 
of sufficient size to be served as a large massive dish, and as 
entremets, and to be able to figure during several days on 
the buffet for accidental want. 

* Careme called his informant ' M. Eugene,' omitting his family name 
of Wolf. He also disapproved of the crumbing of the mould, as it spoiled 
the colour. Dumas's recipe is inexact by the omission of 8 oz. of liquid 
butter and the premature introduction of sugar. Many other copyists 
have similar errors. In our experiments we followed Careme and some 
Austrian modifications with complete success ; also for small Frankfort 
Ku<jelhopfe, S.G.F. (anonymous German cookery-book), 5.53. 



BAB A AND RATAN CAKE 399 



The baba cake was made known in France by Stanislas 
Leczinsky. The descendants of this King always ate the 
baba with a sauce made of sweetened Malaga wine mixed 
with one-sixteenth part of distilled water of tansy {tanaisie 
or tanesie). At present the baba is eaten with similar 
sauces, all containing vinous ingredients, or spirits, or 
liqueur. In Paris babas of small size, formed in small 
moulds, just hke the small brioches and Kugelhopfe, are sold 
in the confectioners' shops. There are large representative 
and smaller and more simple variations of hahas. When a 
baba has not been consumed fresh, it may be cut in slices, 
steeped in Madeira wine, covered with a batter, and fried. 
Such heicjncts of baba are always agreeable at table. 

The Batan Cake has as high an antiquity in Germany and 
France as the brioche in France or the. Bath bun in 
England. It is therefore the duty of the magiric historian 
to protect it in its rights, which are in its home indefeasible, 
but in other countries might be lost for want of assertion. 
This danger exists in France, notwithstanding that the 
ratan cake has been established in its culinary literature for 
at least three centuries. A recipe for the imitation passing 
under the forged name of gateau Savarin was only published 
about 1875, and has since been assiduously copied into later 
culinary productions, mostly verbatim, sometimes, however, 
with such additions as make it a imdding in name, a modi- 
fication partly influenced by the earlier mode of using the 
baba. It has even been degraded so far that it has been 
proposed to be made with baking - powder ; we would 
respectfully leave the product to be eaten by those who 
have made the proposal, did we suppose that they ever 
carried it out themselves. The perpetrator of the plagiarism, 
which he cleverly godfathered upon an innocent celebrity, 
saw reason to mask the external appearance of the cake, 
for he gave an elaborate recipe for a sugar-glace to cover it, 
ordered it to be pierced with a knife in numerous places, 



400 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



and then to be drenched with a thick orange syrup mixed 
with cura9oa. Even this treatment is plagiarized from 
the baba, and thus cake and sauce must be pronounced 
spurious intruders. 

The oldest form of spelling of the name of the cake is 
ratan, and as such it occurs in De Varenne ; the deviations 
are very slight, namely, radan and radon. It may be pre- 
pared with either one dough or two doughs, a fermented 
one and a butter-and-egg stirred dough, both to be mixed 
before transfer to the baking mould. German culinary 
authors give many variations for the preparation of this 
favourite cake, all of which are of no essential importance ; 
they can all be ranged under the two typical processes 
which we have given above. The variations are practised 
mainly with regard to the additions, namely, currants, 
stoned raisins, pounded almonds, cinnamon, and candied 
peel. To our taste, the finest ratan cake is that of two 
doughs without any additions whatsoever ; in that state it 
is equal to the pure brioche, and, by the more equal distribu- 
tion of the pores, mechanically superior to it ; for the brioche 
is partly flaky and rises in layers, while the ratan is not 
so, and rises like sponge-cake in minute uniform bubbles. 
With the increase of the number and quantity of fruity and 
spicy ingredients, the ratan loses its original character, and 
may be changed beyond recognition ; but then it should 
also receive the names by which such derivates ought to 
be designated. Common cookery-books contain detailed 
recipes for many such variations, which uselessly increase 
the number of apparent recipes, teach nothing to the cook 
or general reader, and confuse more than enlighten a person 
who would study the theory of ratan cake with a view of 
having one now and then baked in his kitchen. 

Gomjjiegjie Cake. — Cakes are not rarely named after places, 
which shows, at all events, that they possess, if not much 
specificity, at least an ancient reputation. We have little 



SAVOY AND BISCUIT CAKES 401 



doubt that Bath hims date back to Eoman times, both as to 
composition and shape, the latter being that of the Latin 
placenta. Savoy cake is the result of the culture which 
that land once enjoyed, when its gold-mines assisted the 
genius of its rulers. But of the name of Compiegne cake, 
which figures in modern French collections of recipes, we 
cannot give the raison d'etre, the less so as the current 
recipes for its production are either mere imitations of 
brioche and ratan cake, or so unintelligible as to require 
much technical interpretation. This cake, too, is to be 
drenched with a liqueur, and stratified with apricot jam 
after being sliced, a treatment whereby it loses its character 
as a cake, and becomes, like its companion the false cake 
described above, a pudding. 

Biscuits are tine and light pastry composed of eggs, the 
whites of which are whipped to a snow or froth, with sugar, 
wheat-flour or potato- starch, or both, and sorn^ aromatic or 
colouring substances which are put into the paste. No fat 
is added to this paste, except in the case of the French 
biscuit manque, and the only fat which they contain is the 
oil naturally present in the egg-yolk. 

These cakes must never be baked brown, but remain of a 
pale-yellow colour. To effect this with certainty, their out- 
side is protected by a glace of very finely powdered white 
sugar. If the biscuit be baked in a mould, the latter must 
be covered with butter or suet fat, and this glaced with the 
powdered sugar. In the following are enumerated the 
principal forms of this remarkable pastry : 

Savoy Cake — Fr. Biscuit cle Savoie; Naples Biscuits or 
Ladies' Fingers — Fr. Biscuits a Cuiller;"^ Compound Biscuits : 
Biscuits aux Pistaches, aux Ajnandes, Avelines, Noisettes ; 
Biscuits au Chocolat (one part of chocolate to seven parts of 
sugar) ; a la Genoise, with aniseed flavour, to be cut and 
toasted ; Biscuits a Coupcr are to be sliced and glaced with

402 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

flavoured sugar, or sugar mixed with fruit-juice ; Biscuits a 
VUrsuline are made of biscuit paste mixed with rice, and 
apple or apricot jam, and grilled orange-flower. A number 
of preparations are also called Biscuits Souffles somewhat 
improperly — e.g., the biscuits Souffles aux Amandes, a la 
Fleur d' Granger, and the Biscuits a la Mere Jea7ine — but 
they differ from true biscuits in their essential properties. 

The refined Portuguese bake an excellent biscuit cake 
which they term ^ja^t d'ouro, golden bread ; they do not cut 
it, but the lady or daughter of the house breaks it with her 
fingers. 

There are many variations of Savoy cake produced, e.g., 
by an increase in the number of eggs, from twelve to the 
pound of sugar, to sixteen or even twenty ; these doughs, rich 
in eggs, are not suited for large cakes, but more for small 
preparations like ladies' fingers. Such fancy preparations as 
a Savoy cake in the shape of a siuau, which is plumed with 
beaten cream, or that in the shape of a Juuii, which is 
painted and glaced, provided with a knuckle of chocolate, 
and underlaid with a macedoine of fruit in jelly (attractive 
ornaments for a supper-table intended for the amusement 
of youijg people) — such require a consistent dough with the 
minimum of eggs necessary for its constitution. In most 
biscuit cakes the rising or porosity is produced by the 
admixture of whipped white of egg ; but to one very rich 
variety, containing upon half a pound of starch and a 
pound of sugar the whites of ten eggs and the yolks of 
twenty, half a drachm of powdered hartshorn salt (car- 
bonate of ammonia) is also added, which in raising the 
cake evaporates and disappears. 

In Plum Cake the rich floury basis of cake almost dis- 
appears, or is overtoned entirely by the addition of a large 
amount of raisins, both sultanas and muscatels stoned, 
currants, dried cherries, pounded almonds, minced mixed 
candied peel, and spices. The body of the cake is thus 



SCOTCH BREAD, RUSKS 403 

made for the Emjlish loedding or bride's cake ; but there is 
added to it an outer incrustation, consisting of so-called 
(jlace, or glacing, and icing, together with external decora- 
tions, and a thick layer sometimes between the glacing and 
the cake of almond and sugar ijaste. 

Scotch Bread is a cake of flour, butter, sugar, eggs, spices, 
and lemon, etc., zest, mixed by stirring, and baked in flat 
tins not exceeding 2 inches in depth ; it is used in several 
parts of Scotland at breakfast, luncheon, etc., and for occa- 
sional refreshment. The English Pound Cake is closely 
related to it. 

Caraioay-seed Cake, frequently called Seed Cake merely, is 
a genuine English invention, and a most excellent prepara- 
tion. It consists of a fermented dough with milk, whole 
eggs, yolks, fruit-sugar or honey, and fused butter, sugar 
and flour ; the caraway-seed may be placed on the top of 
the cake, if it be flat and thin, or incorporated with it, if it 
be baked in a high mould like ratan cake; the caraway- 
seed should be steeped in water for some time before being 
put into the dough. 

Brtissels Biscuits, or Busks, Germ. Ziuiehack, are real 
biscuits, inasmuch as their paste is first baked in the shape 
of a loaf, and subsequently cut and grilled for preservation, 
by which process they become rusks. Rusks are defined 
by Johnson as a kind of ship's provisions, but the product 
of this reference represents a more delicate variety of 
cake. In most German towns they can be bought of 
bakers, confectioners, and specialists under the name of 
Zioieback, being the literal German for 'biscuit'; but they 
may not be asked for under the name of * biscuits,' as the 
German bakers and public apply this word to cakes made 
of sponge-cake or Savoy dough. Variations consist in 
the omission of the eggs ; the plainer product is intended 
for immediate consumption when it leaves the oven ; 
others are baked as buns, cut and covered with jam, 



404 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

sugar, and ornamented outside, fit for the confectioner's 
show-window. 

Waffles are artistically-shaped pancakes as to their con- 
stitution, and, like these, admit of interesting and even 
greater variations. Their name* in Old French was lucmfre, 
which was developed into gaufrc and gauffre. The word is 
related to the German Wabc, lioncycomh, and as such would 
be derived from the shape of the waffle, which represents a 
large-celled honeycomb ; it also occurs as ivafer, signifying 
a thin leaf of cooked starch paste, used for sealing letters, 
or for producing the thin round cakes used as a religious 
symbol of bread, and as a base for small cakes which, like 
macroons and ratafias, would adhere to the baking-sheet, if 
the wafer did not intervene. They take a place in the 
history of culture of several widely different nations, and 
by their constitution and parallelism to Eoman scriblita, 
to croplets and the series of cakes with two doughs, challenge 
a philosophical treatment. Amongst the western Anglo- 
Saxons they have gradually been neglected, but survive 
amongst the Flemish branch of the Teutonic race, and are 
there cultivated by specialists, who travel far and wide over 
the Continent, to fairs and feasts, and offer their wares to 
the appreciating multitude. As a means of social enjoy- 
ment and refection waffles offer several advantages over 
other agreeable cakes and confections. They can be made 
impromptu — e.g., in the country after the arrival of unex- 
pected or expected visitors, over a free coal or wood fire, or 
gas flame, and require no oven. They can be consumed 
pari passu as they are baked, and their quantity or number 
can be adapted to the number of persons to be fed. They 
are more certainly produced and less easily spoiled than 

* Waffle was also supposed to be related to the English mufl&n, and 
through this to the maj'ula of the Moors in Morocco, which, e.g. at 
Tangiers, is sold in the streets, at the house-doors, by itinerant vendors, 
who use a bell like the London muffin and crumpet men. But the etymo- 
logy above given makes this relation doubtful. 



WAFFLES AND WAFERS 405 



pancakes. In the Dutch or Flemish waffle - booths they 
are made while the consumer is waiting, and are not kept 
ready, to be deteriorated in taste by keeping. They can be 
garnished with any fruit jam or jelly in their hollows or 
combs, and then constitute an elegant-looking and agree- 
ably-tasting article of confectionery. Waffles should not be 
kept, but in case this be unavoidable they should be made 
hot before use. 

The waffle-irons, which also rejoice in the name of honey- 
comb-cockles, and thus bear out the derivation of waffle from 
Wahe as above indicated, are constructed to offer as large as 
possible a surface to the contact with the dough, to produce 
a quickly and evenly baked light-brown product. They 
should be rather thick in the metal to favour an equal dis- 
tribution of the heat, and an equal browning of all parts of 
the surface of the waffle. The blades of the waffle-irons 
work against each other like the grasping ends of tongs. 
At their outer margins both waffle-iron blades close tightly 
upon each other, allowing only steam to escajpe ; but the 
entire inside leaves just sufficient space to be uniformly 
filled by the dough. It follows that the form must be filled 
with dough only partially, to admit of the rising of the dough 
in baking, and at the same time it must be filled sufficiently, 
so that the dough is in contact with the waffle-irons at all 
points. Any overflowing dough is cut off with a knife; 
when baked, the waffle is easily lifted out of the form. 
Before the dough is put into the form, the latter is greased 
with oiled butter or lard distributed by a feather or brush, 
or with a slice of bacon slowly passed over the form. This 
greasing is particularly requisite with dough containing httle 
or no fat. 

Waffles can be made of three kinds, so far as their 
principal constituent dough is concerned : (1) With a fer- 
mented thin dough or sponge ; such are the waffles sold in 
the Dutch and Flemish booths. They are good to eat 



4o6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

while just hot out of the iron, with a little sugar strewed 
over them, but soon become tough and lose their attraction. 
(2) With a stirred dough, of which flour, eggs, butter, and 
milk are the only ingredients ; this is the richest or fattiest 
form. (3) With a mixture of two doughs prepared separately 
as under (1) and (2). The fermented dough, having been 
started first, as it requires time, is called the fore-dough or 
sponge. The mixed dough corresponds to the mixed doughs 
described above, used for brioche, Kugelhopfe, croplets, pan- 
cakes, etc., but is kept more fluid, so as easily to run into 
the waffle-iron. 

The variations are numerous, but not important; the 
mixed dough may be produced in one operation, but is less 
accomplished. The rising of the waflles may be effected by 
the addition of whii^ped cream or ivhipped white of egg to the 
dough ; the product is called fancy loaffles, and of these 
there are again variations ; French siveet gauffres are such 
fancy gauffres. 

Another form of thin cakes baked in smaller irons, not 
honeycombed, but marked with a pattern, are liiepen or 
hi/ppen. But their constitution is more that of almond 
confections. When that is not the case they differ in no 
wise except in size and outer form from small waffles. 



CHAPTEE XXXIII. 

SPECIALIZED CAKES AND CONFECTIONERIES. 

As we proceed from bread through cakes, we come to an 
increasing specialization of products which are no longer in 
the hands of leakers, but of confectioners. The art of pro- 
ducing any refined cakes is not often, rather very rarely, 



NOUGAT AND OTHER NUT CAKES 407 

possessed by ordinary cooks, and only here and there the 
daughters of families conserve the ancestral art of com- 
pounding such delicacies for the table. When even these 
accomplishments disappear, a general levelling dov^n takes 
place, in v^^hich the standard of quality has to yield to one 
of price. Now comes the opportunity for the imitations 
and counterfeits which excite surprise by their gaudy as 
well as vulgar appearance, and the contrasting feeling 
evoked by their taste. In a Continental town we visited 
the shop of a so-called art haker, and on tasting a ' custard 
tartlet ' were made speechless by the first bite. The custard 
was a sweet flour -paste, coloured yellow with saffron; 
neither egg nor milk had been near the ' custard.' In this 
case ' art ' was equivalent to counterfeit ; the shop was full 
of such counterfeit products. This experience should be an 
incentive to all friends of culture to assist in the preserva- 
tion of the genuine traditions, and combat the deterioration 
of a high art which includes the experience of untold 
generations, and is now in danger of losing many of its orna- 
ments by a relapse into barbarism. We were glad to find 
that in Alsatia confectioners, or, as they are termed in Ger- 
many, Conditorcn, preserved ancient traditions with regard 
to local products particularly, and that the filbert noucjat 
had, like the hazel-nuts of the Vosges, lost nothing of its 
ancient glory. 

Nougat is a confection of some kind of nut, nutcahe, as 
the name suggests, such as almonds, -pistachios, and filberts 
with honey. During late years sugar has taken the place of 
the honey, and in consequence nougat has lost much of its 
pristine character. Any so-called nougat made with sugar 
should be marked S2igar notcgat, but all nougat shortly 
so called ought to be compounded with honey as the only 
sweet ingredient. 

Hazel-nuts were by the Greeks called Pontic nuts, or nuts 
of Heraclea, the capital of Pontus, the land south of the 



4o8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Black Sea. The Latins received hazel nuts from PrcBueste 
and Avellinum. From the latter village the French name 
of avelines originated, also the adjective adopted in Linne's 
botany, Avellana. Hazel-nuts have lost nothing in the 
esteem of mankind, as we can see from the discussion of 
their merits by the Greek physician Galen. 

Pistachios are, according to Theophrast, natives of India, 
and were brought to Eome from Syria by Lucius Vitellius 
in the reign of Tiberius ; thence they were taken to Spain 
by Flaccus Tiberius. The discussion for and against pista- 
chios, which was once lively amongst physicians, as evidenced 
by the discussions on them contained in the works of Galen 
and Avicenna, are of no practical value now that the 
character of their nuts is fully known. 

The White Nougat of Marseilles consists of almonds and 
pistachios boiled with Narbonne honey. The Brown Nougat 
is made with burnt almonds only, without any pistachios, 
and into this mainly has sugar been introduced, not for 
gustatory, but for mechanical reasons. This brown com- 
pound is much used for the construction of fancy con- 
fectionery representing rocks and ruins, and as these have 
sometimes to be kept and transported, and honey nougat 
would not have the requisite solidity to endure this, sugar 
had to be substituted for the honey to enable the rocks and 
ruins to maintain their position and structure. 

Genoa Cakes, Fr. Genoises, generally occur as cakelets, 
and are made of sugar, eggs, flour, almonds, or pistachios, 
walnuts, filberts, etc., glaced on the top; they are liable to 
undergo many variations— some like nougat, but without 
honey being introduced. (A large dense ijlum cake, with 
almonds outside, sold in slices by London confectioners under 
the name of Genoa cake, does not fit the definition of that 
name in our historical system.) In * Dons de Comus ' gonoises 
are covered tartlets like English mince-pies, and plums do 
not enter into their composition. There are many varia- 



GE NOISES, MADELEINES, AND PETITS CHOUX 409 

tions from \hQj)lain: namely, with almonds, small (in ' Dons 
de Comus ' it is said that the smaller the genoises the better 
they are), oraiujc-flavoiirecl ; with ijistac J no s ; with, filberts ; 
but the French genoises perlees au raisin de Corinthe, which 
are to have single currants as a top-dressing on the glace, 
are really examples of trifling with so-called ornament, and 
literally childish play. 

Madeleines are cakes of great reputation in France, related 
to genoises, and made with the same kind of batter as these ; 
they are produced plain and with variations. The Made- 
leines of Commercy had a special local reputation, the con- 
sequence mainly, it was reported, of the admiration which 
the Polish King Stanislas Leczinsky manifested for them 
when he travelled in France ; but this local reputation was 
more probably the result of the accident that a Madame 
Perrotin de Barmond had a cook who baked very good 
madeleines, and as her names happened to be Madeleine 
Paumier, she was credited locally, and quite unduly, with 
the invention of the cakes. Variations are effected by 
additions of dried fruit, angelica, all of which in our opinion 
detract from the specificity of the cakes. This specificity 
has a fixed basis, for, as in English iwund cake, the three 
principal ingredients of madeleines — flour, sugar, and butter 
— are added in equal parts. 

Ghoux Patissiers, or Petits Chonx, are cakelets baked of a 
batter previously boiled, like the batter of souffles. There is 
no English equivalent for the name, except the perhaps 
jocular 'petty slioes' of some English cooks be accepted as 
such. The French name choux may be derived from a 
similarity in shape to certain round cabbages. Several 
varieties are made ; a la Parisienne ; pains a la duchesse, 
which has been translated into Duchess loaves ; profit rolles; 
and Mecca loaves, or Mecca cakes. The jj?'o/z^ rolles are 
hollow, and filled with some kind of custard from the top, 
through an opening of the size of a shilling, cut with a 



4TO THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



sharp knife. A chocolate custard is suitable for filling them. 
Mecca calces are made with soft flour-paste or batter con- 
taining cream, and called i^dtc mollctte ; they are also filled 
with cream or preserves, and are the cream-tarts of the 
' Arabian Nights ' tales ])y which the sister of the exiled 
Sultan recognised her brother in his incognito of pastrycook. 
There are clioux witJi cheese ; choux with almonds, Medina 
loaves {nobis) ; choux puffs, or choux souffles, flavoured with 
the zest of oranges; choux souffles in moulds with cedrat; 
2)etits clioux hedcjehogged with split pistachios. 

Of cakes of which nouilles or macaroni, or other dry 
Italian paste preparations, are leading ingredients, Nouilles 
Cake a V Allcmctnde is typical. Nouilles paste is said by 
Dumas to be of German origin ; hence the French name is 
probably a euphonious (for the French tongue) expression 
for the German name Nudchi. Translated into English, 
this might become noodles, but owing to the collateral 
humorous significance of this word, it became impracticable 
to use it for culinary purposes, and we therefore retain the 
French derivate nouilles as most widely applicable. The 
cake is a thin flat one which is doubled upon itself, or laid 
over a second one after having been covered with apricot 
jam. Some garnish the cake with a thin layer of meringue 
paste, over this shredded pistachios, granite sugar, and 
small pink and white comfits. All these garnishes are 
more adapted to the confectioner's window than the 
service of the private kitchen. The Nudelhuchen can be 
classified in a system hke ours only by its leading ingredient, 
for in its execution it is varied so as to become now a 
pudding, now a savoury cheese entremets, and again a cake 
in the principal sense of the word. Analogous cakes may 
be made with macaroni, vermicelli, semolina, rice, potatoes, 
sago, tapioca, but they have little specificity. 

Meringues are classical confections having a good prospect 
of immortality, as they cannot easily be improved, spoiled,

or altered. They have probably a history of more than a 
thousand years, their name being supposed to -l)e a con- 
tracted derivate of Merovingians, the family name of the 
imperial house which was superseded on the throne of 
Franconia by the Karolingians, thus indicating the time at 
which they were invented. 

Meringues can be made of two varieties, according to 
whether any starch is put into the preparation or not ; 
incidentally to such addition, the proportions of the main 
ingredients, white of egg and sugar, have to be altered ; the 
addition of starch assimilates the preparation somewhat to 
sponge or Savoy cake. The pure ineriugiies of albumin and 
sugar only are known in France as haisers, or as Simnish 
foam, and a large confection of the kind is called Syanisli 
tourte ; this latter is a construction in layers of sheets of 
meringue paste leaked, iced, and stratified with whipped 
cream. Compound Meringues, or Meringue Darioles, the 
latter corrupted into Boyals, are little round cakes of puff 
paste, the inner basin of w4iich is filled with meringue paste. 
The large meringue, or Grosse Meringue d la Parisienne, is 
a pretentious preparation which has no advantage over the 
common meringue, but, on the contrary, has exchanged the 
convenience of prearranged subdivision for the necessity 
of subdividing the product under very inconvenient cir- 
cumstances for the sole purpose of making it a little more 
showy. 

Honey Cake, German Leckerkuclien, Lehhuchen, syn. 
LecJcerle of the Swiss {lecker means tasty, toothsome), a 
cake of flour and honey, mostly somewhat fermented, 
flavoured with various ingredients, is probably the oldest 
known cake in the world, being described in the works of 
the Eoman rustic writers. It should be preserved in its 
purity and perfection, and eaten annually by all lovers of 
the history of evolution of human culture, and of human 
culture itself. Strange to relate, in some cookery-books 



412 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



both of England and Germany, neither honey nor honey 
cake are as much as mentioned, and typical cakes, such as 
nougat, are so far denaturalized, degenerated, vulgarized, as 
to be directed to be made with sugar instead of honey. 
Some even prescribe crt»e-sugar syrup, i.e., treacle, and 
warn the reader not to use beetroot treacle. All these 
cakes might have their opportunity and place, but they 
should be carefully distinguished from the genuine historical 
honey cakes. Besides the j)lain honey cake and the varia- 
tions just indicated, there are celebrated the Basle honey 
cakes and cakelets, the lohite Nuremberg and variations, and 
Berlin pavement. 

Various small cakes, passing under the name of biscuits, 
are derived from some of the greater cakes above de- 
scribed, and are mostly somewhat compound with little 
specificity. This is also indicated by their names, which 
are derived either from a locality or an ingredient. They 
occur under such names as : Italian biscuits (Savoy cakelets 
with chopped almonds on the top), Genoese biscuits (mere 
gdnoises sandwiched with preserve), i:)each biscuits (oval 
cakes of Savoy material, shaped like half-peaches and filled 
with peach jam), ajjricot biscuits (analogous to the previous 
ones), Sicilian biscuits, brown bread biscuits, ginger-cake 
biscuits J caraioay biscuits, orange-flavoured biscuits. Some 
cakelets, described in English works as Albert biscuits and 
Victoria biscuits, are really darioles. The aniseed-flavoured 
biscuits, a form of German Christmas cakes, are much in 
favour in South Germany ; they are generally flat squares, 
or cut shapes, with some design in relief impressed upon 
them. The relief designs may be fanciful, historical, or 
have reference to contemporary events. Probably no 
previous heroes were ever shaped in dough, baked and eaten, 
so frequently as the Emperor William and his warriors and 
statesmen. 

.4 cake resembling a i^iidding, or pdtc, is Bice cake, 



MILLE FEUILLES, MA CROONS, BRENTEN 413 



encrusted ivith almonds ; it also resembles a souffle, because 
the paste is first boiled and then baked ; of this there are 
variations, one being baked in a case of paste, timbale of 
rice, others resulting from substitution. 

Many -flaked cakes, Gdteaicx de Mille Feuilles, are an 
ancient highly-complicated luxury. Carerae* says of it that 
' cette grosse piece appartient encore a nos anciens.' The 
mille is only a large round number to represent many, for 
the flakes, or feuilles, actually rise to several thousands in 
a cake. If, say, a pound of puff paste receives ten turns as 
prescribed, that yields 512 layers of flakes ; if, as in the 
simi)le mille feuilles cake, five such strata of 512 layers each 
are superposed, we have 2,560 flakes, and if, as in the com- 
pound mille feuilles cake, ten such layers are superposed, we 
get 5,120 flakes. 

Cakes tcith pTevalcncc of almonds carry almonds both in 
their substance and on the top ; they are varied by additions 
of fruit and flavours. Their most specific representatives are 
Sioedish macroons, but the rest are obscure undistinguished 
compositions. 

Macroons are meringue paste with pounded almonds 
added. They are made with ratafia flavour, i.e., a few 
bitter almonds are mixed with the sweet ; macroons made 
of bitter almonds mainly are called ratafias, and are always 
of small size. 

Brenten, or Frankfort Brenten, are made of a paste of 
powdered almonds and sugar, which is roasted, and then 
receives an addition of a little flour, milk, cinnamon, and 
rose-water. The name of Brenten may possibly be derived 
from the fact of the paste being roasted, i.e., burnt (Germ. 
gehrannt). 

Here may be placed Cracklhig, or Knack Cakes, which con- 
tain butter and eggs, and have the almonds on the surface. 

Fanclionettes are little round cakes consisting of a basis of 
* ' Patissier Royal Parisien,' i. 266-272. 



414 ' THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



flake dough, or puff paste, in the shax^e of a flat little cup, 
like a dariolc, filled with a semi-liquid or moist creavi-Uke 
preparation, which in the older preparation was loliitc, 
intended to represent, and maiuly consisting of, cream, but 
in the later recipes also contained yolks, and thus became a 
custard. This second layer is next to be masked over with 
meringue paste, i.e., a mixture of white of egg, froth, and 
sugar, and this is to be ornamented on the top with bright- 
coloured jellies and jams. Fanchonettes are entremets, and 
were much fancied towards the latter half of the eighteenth 
century ; hence they have been termed some of the friandiscs 
du dernier siecle. How little these delicate and elegant 
cakes are understood nowadays is evident from this fact 
alone, that some of the best books on pastry, in describing 
fanchonettes, omit entirely the basis of puff paste, without 
which such a cake is as impossible as a 'pdtd without a case. 
Fanchonettes are varied, flavoured with vanille, or prepared 
with compjound milk of almonds, or Mocha coffee, or choco- 
late ; some add currants, others _/;/stoc/wos or filberts ; all 
these modifications are immaterial, and hardly harmonize 
with the plan of the cakelet. 

Of Cheese Cakes the earliest description occurs in the 
Latin work already often alluded to, entitled ' De Re 
Eustica,' and ascribed to Cato the Elder, called of Utica. 
He simply terms it placenta, which is the Latin for cake in 
general, and not for any particular cake. Placenta is 
derived from the Greek placous, which also means cake, 
and is itself a contraction of placoeis, meaning flat, plane, 
even, broad, so that the Greek name of cake seems to 
embody the idea of its accidental shape, and not to be a 
symbol of its intrinsic nature. Cheese in connection with 
these cakes does not mean ripe cheese in the ordinary sense, 
but fresh pressed curds, or caseine. Cheese cakes, like/<x7i- 
chonettes, have a basis of flake dough or pujf paste, shaped 
like a little flat saucer, and filled with a sweet custard con- 



FANCHONETTES, 3IIRLIT0NS, DARIOLES 415 



sisting of caseine, butter, aud sugar. In ancient Rome 
such cakes were sometimes made of large size, as they are 
made in Germany in the present day, and termed Mattc- 
Kuclieu, matte meaning curds. Of variations the best known 
are ornamented cheese cakes, or Coventry tartlets, but we 
fear that these imitations of the exterior of fanclioncttcs 
will never be equal to the simple grace of the plain cheese 
cake. 

Mirlitons are tartlets with a basis of puff paste con- 
structed like cheese cakes, but with the cheese left out. 
Mirliton means a reed-inpe, but the metaphor by which the 
tartlet came to the name has not been explained. Dumas 
mentioned the cakes by name, but gave no description of or 
recipe for them. The contents of the little tartlets are 
portions of a compound custard flavoured with ratafias, 
candied orange-flowers, and spice. In variations a flavour- 
ing of chocolate, or an addition of pistachios or almonds, 
is introduced; some interpolate apricot or pineapple jam 
between the puff' paste and custard. 

Pithiviers Cakes consist of a siveet paste of almonds on a 
basis of puff' paste, and are produced according to two 
principal patterns : in the large pattern the almond cream 
IS enclosed between two layers of puff paste ; in the small 
or tartlet pattern the cream is distributed in covered tartlets 
contained in dariole moulds. The cream or custard is in 
all respects the same as that of cheese cakes, but the place 
of the caseine is taken by the pounded almonds. Here and 
there a specialized almond cake passes under the name of 
Gateau de Pithiviers without any basis or covering of puff 
paste. This preparation, bearing the name improperly, 
should be excluded from consideration under this head. 
D'Artois Cakes and Conde Cakes are inventions of flattering 
culinarians, mere synonyms, which have done their service, 
and are without any further use. 

German Apricot Tart has a basis of puff' paste, or short 



4i6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



paste, and its specificity as to fruit is that its cavity within 
the torta is filled with cooked sliced ajjricots, covered over 
with apricot jam used as a mortar. Such a tart may be made 
with any sort of fruit which can be stewed so as to preserve 
its shape, and be made into jam also ; probably apples are 
ideally qualified in this respect, and stand next to apricots 
in usefulness. The tart may be covered with a lid of puff 
paste, and then is what some French books term a D'Artois 
of Apricots, an absurd slavish misnomer for covered apricot 
tart. 

A more simple covered tart of apples and apricots is 
called a turnover, the apples and jam being enclosed 
between two layers of tart paste. Plums, if not too juicy, 
and their jam, are suitable to be enclosed in turnovers; 
these forms of fruit pie are very popular amongst young 
people. 

Dariolcs belong to the patisserie cVciitremcts ; they are 
little shallow cups of pufi' paste filled with a compound 
cream or custard ; they are therefore thus far identical with 
fanclionettes, but do not rise to the complication of the 
latter, there being no meringue paste garnish, and no top of 
ornamentation. There was also a difference formerly cle 
rigueur, now neglected; the creams of the fancJionettes were 
white, those of the darioles yellow. On the whole, we may 
term darioles the simple form or beginning of fanchonettes , 
and these latter compound darioles, to establish a com- 
parative definition of both. Both should retain their 
ancient names. 

There are some variations of darioles worthy of notice, 
such as wdth orange flavour, called a la Diichesse, and with 
coffee flavour, but they are unimportant. When, however, 
the custard of darioles receives an addition of cheese of any 
kind, fresh or ripe, the product assumes a new special name, 
that of Talmouse. No ratafias are added to such, while 
they are added to cheese cakes ; on the other hand, 



HISTORICAL SMALL CAKES 417 



tcdmouses receive au addition of flour in their custard paste, 
which is not made to cheese cake. Darioles with apricot 
jam and nuts, such as almonds, pistachios, or filberts, are 
termed Placoases by a few moderns, though the name does 
not occur either in La Chapelle, or ' Dons de Comus,' or 
Careme. The apricots and nuts being above the custard, a 
placouse is a transition from dariole to fanchonette. The 
cuHnary levellers of small modern manuals have absurdly 
called the jjlacouse * apricot nougat,' their intended product 
being a common puff paste cake with jam spread over it, 
thus proving that they know neither the nature of a placouse 
nor the character of nougat. 

Pastry Custard, ov Co^npound Pastry Cream for garnishing 
Tarts and Tartlets, is a smooth batter of equal parts of 
flour and sugar, with eggs, milk, or cream and butter ; its 
lowest form is the substitute with which * art bakers ' pro- 
duce their counterfeit darioles. Florentines are darioles 
which combine certain features of cheese cakes and fanclio- 
nettes, without being entirely one or the other. They 
contain curds, butter, yolks, flour, bitter almonds, zest 
of lemon, and the composition is placed on thin shells of 
puff paste ; the rest is much like the finishing of fancho- 
nettes ; a florentine might therefore be defined as a fancho- 
nette into the custard of which caseine has been introduced. 

Love Wells, or Gateaux de Puits d^ Amour, are laborious 
little jam tarts, with a rather ambitious title, and an 
example of what the French ladies used to call chatter ies, 
i.e., dainties or delicacies for company (Balzac). They were 
much in use in the last century. 

Puff Paste is made to assume various forms for which it is 
inappropriate. Such are the loalnuts of culinary malaprops ; 
or the sandioiches absurdly called * bread-and-butter pastry,' 
which are, in fact, simple slices of puff paste baked and then 
agglutinated by jam ; puff paste loreaths or rings ; plain 
jam tartlets, termed Polish cakes for reasons not stated 

27

(these tartlets may be beautifully made ; the recipes for 
theui are almost repetitions of those for the puits d'amour) ; 
apple tartlets^ covered with a lattice-work of thin puff paste 
(misnamed by careless authors a mosaic of paste, a special 
board for producing such lattice- work being also misnamed 
a mosaic board). 

Parisian Loaves may be defined as ornamented encaustic 
finger biscuits, and are curious by their complication, which 
may be characterized as the application of the admonition, 
Stick it on ! The metaphorically * encaustic ' part consists 
of * narrow strips ' of currant jelly, greengage jam, etc. 

Cherry Tartlets are highly artistic preparations. The 
cherries may be replaced by raspberries, currants, goose- 
berries, and plums of several kinds ; the fruit must be so 
treated that the juice may not be either excessive, or too 
thin, or too acid. 

Marigolds is the name of little cakes of puff paste, with 
almonds so arranged as to remind of the petals of the golden 
flower of the dead. 

Fruit Tarts and Fruit Pies are essentially different things, 
though frequently confounded. An arrangement consisting 
of fruit in a dish, covered with any kind of paste and baked, 
is a pie, and not a tart. A ring of pastry inside of which 
the fruit is placed is a real tart in the Eoman sense ; but 
tart may and does include any cake with a rim on or within 
which fruit is disposed. The innovation of terming a fruit 
pie a tart, against which even otherwise good authors are 
not proof, arises, in the first place, from vanity, which 
erroneously fancies that tart signifies something superior 
to pie ; secondly, from want of information concerning the 
meaning of the names of these historical preparations. As 
all affectation leads to inconsistencies, so this miscalling a 
fruit pie a tart leads to the difficulty that it cannot be applied 
to preparations of meat, for the majority would find it 
ridiculous if anyone were to speak of meat tart. Yet there 



TARTS, PIES, AND MINCE-PIES 419 



might be a meat tart properly so called, if only it were 
arranged upon the Eoman pattern of the torta of a twisted 
ring of pastry outside, as the container of a ragout inside 
the ring, the ragout being the contained. Persons of dis- 
cerning taste should strive to dissociate all crusts whatever 
from fruit as well as meat during their preparation, and 
cook all three by themselves, uniting them only shortly 
before or during the meal. 

Mince Pies as now commonly made are tarts and tartlets 
of puff or short paste, laid in moulds, covered or open, 
and containing suitable quantities of mincemeat. By the 
practice of subdivision, they belong to the category of small 
ixtstry rather than to cakes and puddings. In their case, 
the consideration which we have placed before the reader 
in the previous paragraph concerning the use of the word 
pie has received rather a contrary illustration, for the cakes 
connected with mincemeat of this particular kind are called 
Xiies, even though they conform to the enlarged definition 
of tarts. But this is explained by the exceptional position 
which mincemeat itself holds as a mixture of flesh meat 
with fruit of several kinds. The original idea of mincemeat 
as a flesh-food happily still surviving, it was called mince- 
meat still, even by those who left out the flesh, and trans- 
formed both title and mince into a delusion. Even they 
knew that it would be ridiculous to call a mince pie a mince 
tart, although it revealed the true nature of their nerve- 
and meaning-less composition. Mince pies, then, are dis- 
tinguished by containing meat previously roasted and 
matured by being penetrated with the flavour of fruit and 
brandy. By the mode of its preparation, and the addition 
of the brandy, mincemeat becomes capable of being pre- 
served for a considerable time, and one operation thus 
suffices to provide the materials for many pies, which can 
be made during, and at the distance of, several weeks from 
each other. 



420 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

As a warning against counterfeits^ it should be mentioned 
that, perhaps in connection with vegetarian predilections, 
recipes for mincemeat so called have crept into cookery- 
books which contain no meat at all, some of them being at 
the same time provided with a great excess of alcoholic 
ingredients. Such preparations should not be called mince- 
meat, and should be excluded from culinary literature as 
long as they bear a false title. 

The Glacing, Icing, or Encrusting of Cakes are processes 
applied partly for their ornamentation, partly for their 
preservation, particularly from exsiccation. The j^lcUn sugar 
glace is made with powdered sugar, white of egg, and a little 
washing blue (cobalt or smalte blue), and is spread cold on 
the hot cake. Chocolate glacing is applied hot, the pieces 
of cake being immersed in the fused solution of the chocolate 
in pearling syrup. Several other flavours may be imparted 
to the fused sugar instead of the chocolate, and in this 
particular the ingenuity of the confectioner has much 
opportunity for the display of variety. Thus, the sections 
of a twelfth cake may be flavoured with a selection of 
essences and liqueurs ; the icing for bride cake, however, 
should be quite neutral. 



CHAPTEE XXXIV. 

THE PHILOSOPHY OF PUDDINGS. 

Puddings are, as to the name, of uncertain derivation. In 
French they were formerly called poutins (La Chapelle), or 
poutinade {' Dons de Comus,' i. 298) ; but this hard spelHng 
does not occur in modern dictionaries. The modern French 
word ho^idin is not practically equivalent to pudding, as its 
application is confined to compositions of animal matters 



THE PHILOSOPHY OF PUDDINGS 421 



— e.g., black pudding. Puddings are mostly cooked by boiling 
or steaming, more rarely by baking. Thus, of some thirty 
odd puddings which we have compared, only four — Somer- 
setshire pudding, plain bread pudding, Bakewell pudding, 
and lemon pudding — are baked ; the remainder, with the 
variations nearly thirty dishes, are all boiled. 

Puddings resemble souffles in this, that their substance 
is to a large extent already cooked before it is placed into 
the composition which fills the shape. The materials which 
are thus frequently used are bread, white and brown, Italian 
pastes, brioche. Savoy or sponge cake (biscuit), macroons, 
and ratafias. The contents of boiled puddings surrounded 
with a case of suet dough — such as fruit (apples) or meat 
{e.g., mutton) — are cooked, at least partly, before being 
placed into the capsule. 

A few puddings, however, are compounded directly from 
elementary cooking materials — e.g., Somersetshire puddings. 
A so-called Yorkshire pudding — such as is eaten with meat 
— is also made directly and baked ; but these are exceptional 
compositions amongst puddings. Indeed, a pudding is 
mostly, if we may be allowed to use an expression from 
petrology, a breccia — a compound formed of fragments of a 
material which had a previous independent existence, and 
bound together by a soft mortar or cement which was able 
to penetrate and fill the pores of, and intervals between, the 
lumps, and then become set by the culinary thermic process. 
It is by this that pudding becomes a unity, and receives 
a kind of gustatory homogeneity, however numerous and 
diversified may be the substances introduced into its con- 
stitution. 

Puddings should not be hard, or even too solid, but easily 
comminuted or squashed. The boiled cabinet _/j?/(r7(:?/?z//, a 
distinctly English invention, is the very ideal of a confection 
of this kind. 

During the last years of the existence of the German 



422 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Diet at Frankfort, that town was the metropolis of sdeci 
international cookery. The table d'hote of the Eussische 
Hof on the Zeil reflected this culture, and its enterprising 
proprietor, Herr Sarg, well maintained this merited reputa- 
tion. He did so in all courses, all served on silver plate, 
but particularly by his puddings. When the Universal 
Peace Congress was assembled at Frankfort before the 
middle of the present century, many of its members dined 
at the Eussische Hof, and they so well appreciated the fare, 
and particularly the puddings, that the quantity which was 
known to suffice for a certain number of persons in ordinary 
times had to be almost doubled during the Congress. In 
his * Letters on Chemistry ' the late Baron Liebig ascribed 
this fact, communicated to him by Sarg himself, to the cir- 
cumstance chat a number of the Peace Congress men were 
total abstainers from alcoholic liquids. That may have 
contributed to the increased consumption of puddings, but 
we believe that the main cause of the unparalleled appetite, 
particularly of the Quaker members of the Congress, during 
that time was the unrivalled good quality of the puddings 
themselves. Our comparison of pudding with breccia has 
been anticipated by mineralogists in this, that they call 
some kinds of breccia inidding - stone. The concrete of 
builders is an artificial imitation of the natural breccia ; 
the concreted variegated Carrara marble is the finest 
example of natural pudding-stone. 

Puddings are, for the purpose of being boiled, placed into 
a shape or mould, or tied up in a cloth, or secured in both 
a cloth and a mould as well. All moulds, whether of metal 
or earthenware or porcelain, have to be buttered, and 
crumbed or floured, before the pudding material is placed 
in ; unlike souffles, puddings require but little space for ex- 
pansion. The mould containing the pudding maybe sur- 
rounded by an outer vessel containing boiling water, a so- 
called water-bath, and may in this be placed in a hot oven 



THE BOILING OF PUDDINGS 423 

and cooked. In that case the water must be kept boiling, 
and must be periodically resupplied in a boiling state as it 
evaporates. The water must not rise to above half the 
height of the mould containing the pudding, in order that 
no portion of it may get inside the mould. If the mould 
can be hermetically closed, it may be boiled submerged in 
water. All covers of moulds should be fastened down or 
weighted, so that the steam may not blow them off. From 
this it follows that a Papin's digester is the most suitable 
vessel to boil a pudding in. A closed mould for puddings 
has this further advantage, that its contents may be left in 
it until the moment of serving, as they will not become 
overdone or deteriorated in a short time. 

The larger-sized varieties of puddings are mostly boiled 
in a najihin, or imdding-dotli, selected for the purpose. 
Such a napkin or cloth must, just before use, be soaked for 
an hour in boiling water, and then wrung out. Butter is 
then spread over it, and this in its turn is dusted over 
with flour. This keeps the water away from the pudding, 
and helps in the separation of the cloth from the pudding 
after the coction is completed. When the ends of the cloth 
are gathered over the raw pudding and about to be tied, 
care is to be taken to leave a little, but no excess of space 
between the pudding and the gathering folds of the cloth, 
or its binding ; the pudding must be kept solid all round, 
but have room to expand a little. Some cooks suspend 
puddings in cloths by a string passing over a pulley, so as 
to allow a part of the top to be out of water, while the 
pudding is being kept together by gravity as well as the 
cloth ; but for this proceeding special apparatus is requisite. 
Some cooks prefer boiling their puddings in pans of earthen- 
ware, because, being slower conductors of heat than metal 
pots, they boil steadier, and evaporate less water than metal 
boilers. If the pudding be too closely tied it may burst 
the cloth, and be partially or entirely lost. But with reason- 



424 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



able precaution the preparation and boiling of puddings is 
one of the most certain processes of culinary practice. 

We shortly define some puddings without giving the 
details of their recipes. Sir Watkin Wynn Pudding: A 
suet, bread, and sugar mass, with eggs, juice and zest of 
lemons; a classical dish. Somersetsliire Pudding: Egg, 
flour, sugar, and butter in equal parts, flavoured. The 
stirred mass is poured into small conical tins which are only 
half filled ; during baking they rise to double the volume of 
the dough or batter. They are eaten with wine sauce, and 
when cold adaiit of being dressed with liqueur, or wine and 
custard, or as trifle. They are related to the biscuit puddings, 
resembling Savoy cake. Plum Pudding is the national 
English representative of this class of dishes. It is generally 
boiled, but may be baked in a buttered casserole. A French 
author says that plum pudding was a farinaceous dish, 
without which there was no good meal in England ; essen- 
tial and constitutive were flour, eggs, and butter, the taste 
of which was enhanced by different ingredients : cherries, 
sago, citron, cauliflower, etc. Plums, required by the title, 
are not mentioned. Puddings of vermicelli, semolina, tajnoca, 
and icheat-grits are analogous to souffles, inasmuch as their 
ingredients are twice cooked. Broun Bread and Cherry 
Pudding is an English analogue to the German thick Cherry 
Cake so called, which is really a pudding, mostly eaten cold. 
Brioche Jam and Custard Pudding is made with variations. 
Bread Pudding is very popular in this country ; when the 
top is well gratinated it is very agreeable. It admits of 
many variations, which increase in complication until they 
result in cabinet pudding. Busk Jam and Custard Pudding 
is the transition to Cabinet Pudding, a composition of sponge- 
cake, macroons, and lemon custard, with dried cherries 
and candied citron, etc. Savoy Cake or Biscuit Pudding is 
closely related; French authors justly describe these last 
puddings as entremets anglais. There are various puddings

named after Ginger, Pinea][>i:>le, Lemon, Orange, Marroiu, and 
Fruit (Grand Pudding a la Moelle). Bice and Marroiv 
Pudding, with orange flavour, is a specific and rich pudding ; 
the so-called Parisian Cabinet Pudding is also rich, but 
too fat and crowded with ingredients. Ai>2jle and Apicot 
Pudding is made with a suet crust, and boiled ; it gives the 
best flavoured preparation of apples, particularly with gray 
russets or Wellingtons. Bice and Apijle Pudding is an 
excellent dish, both hot and cold. Conijjound Bread and 
Apple Pudding, also called Eve's, is liked by some. The 
Duke of Cumberland's Pudding is very similar to Eve's 
Pudding, and like this is excellent. Bakeivell Pudding, 
which is more like an artistic tart than a pudding, worthily 
closes the list of this division of nutritious, digestible, and 
elegant preparations. Mutton Pudding and its analogues, 
made with different kinds of meat, are really pasties with 
mushrooms and a rich ragout confined in a case of suet 
paste and boiled.

PREPARATIONS OF FRUIT RESEMBLING RAISED 
PIES, HOT CHARLOTTES, FLANS. 

The Croquembouche, or Croquant, of Oranges is a structure 
like a pate crust, raised of sections of oranges, each section 
dipped in fused sugar ; the central cylindric cavity is to be 
filled with whipped cream. There are a number of such 
confections, all termed croquembouche from the encrusting 
sugar, made with chestnuts, walnuts, ratafias ; the place of 
the cream may be taken by a bavaroise or macedoine. 

When the raised pie-case is made of rice and filled with 
apples boiled for ten minutes in syrup, an analogue of the 



426 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

boiled suet-dough apple pudding is produced. Or the apples, 
pommes cVAfrique or pommes d'cqn, parboiled in syrup, each 
containing a preserved cherry, are put into a crust of vol- 
au-vent, or of tourtes d' entremets glaces, or of croustades of 
fine paste in form of a flan. The apples maybe covered or 
interspersed with layers of meringue paste. 

On the other hand, the apples may be used, as the oranges 
above, for the production of a raised case, and the interior 
of this may be filled with a p)astry custard. When the 
apples are pricked and left prickly all over with sharply 
sliced almonds, a so-called liedgeJiog of apples results. 

Apple Dumplings are fancied by many persons, and 
should be well prepared. Peel and core the apples, and fill 
them with apricot jam ; wrap them in very thinly rolled- 
out paste, and paint them with beaten egg. Now put coils 
of bands of thin puff paste around them, give them the 
form of apples, and for a stalk a bit of cinnamon to each ; 
bake them in the oven, glace them with sugar, and send 
them to table. 

Hot Charlottes are correctly defined as preparations of 
fruit, contained in edible cases resembling in form those 
of raised pies, but being compounded of previously baked 
paste — such as bread, biscuit, or other materials. They 
may therefore be of great simplicity as regards material ; 
while, on the other hand, they admit of great complication 
of material and ornamentation of structure. The name is 
more than a century old, and its origin is not stated. The 
Apple Charlotte is the most typical. A round, buttered 
Charlotte mould is lined with evenly-trimmed pieces of 
breadcrumb well buttered ; the cavity is filled with half- 
stewed slices of apples, to w^hich apricot jam, currants, etc., 
may be added, and closed with buttered bread. It is baked 
to a nice colour, turned out, and glaced. A Pear Charlotte 
is a generalization, and, as the pears are too mild, they 
require the admixture wnth them of red j^lum jam or damson 



CHARLOTTES AND FLANS 427 

jam to the amount of half their weight. Other charlottes are 
interesting parallels, e.g., that of cqjvicots, or of ap'icots and 
apples mixed ; for that of peaches the fruit must be under-ripe, 
and if possible red-fleshed, so-called blood peaches. Thus, it 
is seen that there are not many varieties of fruit which can 
be placed appropriately into a hot charlotte. Careme put a 
pot of preserved stoned cherries, without the syrup, with 
the small rosy apples. This is a composition differing from 
the accepted addition of jams used as correctives — such 
as apricot jam for apples, plum or damson jam for pears. 
You may mix the apples with quinces, with currants or 
sultanas, or Malaga muscatel raisins; in that case you 
diminish the sugar to be added to the apples by as much 
as corresponds to half the weight of the currants or raisins 
added. Charlottes may be filled with phims, amongst them 
the German Zioetschen, which are well flavoured, not over- 
juicy, and preserve their shape ; with mirahelles, the small 
yellow and golden plums ; and with greengages in an under- 
ripe state. 

The cases of hot charlottes do not admit of much varia- 
tion, and remain best when made with buttered bread; but 
cold charlottes may receive cases of brioche, Compiegne 
cake, Bath buns. Savoy cake, etc., even Genoa cake; the 
products pass under the name of Charlottes of CroiXtes, and 
may be ornamented with coloured icings. 

Flans are varieties of French cakes, resembling cheese 
cakes in construction when they are small ; but when they 
are large they appear more like raised pies. In any case, 
the basis or covering is made of fresh paste, of flour, sugar, 
butter, yolks, and salt. The fruit is carefully prepared, so 
as to have a thick syrupy sauce only, and is then enclosed 
in the paste ; the whole is baked. A flan is therefore 
strictly analogous to a raised meat pie. All the fruit used 
with charlottes may be employed in connection with flans. 
Apples for flans are first parboiled in thick syrup; milk is 



428 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

flavoured with vanilla, thickened with grits, and to this the 
syrup of the apples is added ; add further j^oivdered sugar, 
yolks of eggs, butter, and whipped cream. This preparation 
is now placed in the bottom of the raised pie-case, and the 
apples are arranged upon it ; the whole is baked until the 
apples take a little colour. 



CHAPTEE XXXVI. 

PREPARATIONS OF BEEF. 

In England, be it in town or country, beef is mostly to be 
had of excellent quality. Much of what is now sold in 
populous centres comes from foreign countries, or the 
colonies, even the antipodes, in a frozen or otherwise 
preserved state. But the best so-called prime beef is of 
Scotch origin, and fattened on the pastures of the Midland 
counties. 

The prime pieces of beef used for eating are the follow- 
ing : 

The loin, mostly termed sirloin, which is generallj^ eaten 
roast, without being boned for that purpose ; but for braising 
it is generally boned. A (half or one side) loin weighs from 
fifteen to twenty pounds. 

The under-cut, or fillet, mostly goes with the loin, and is 
roasted with it. In Kitchiner's * Oracle,' this part is called 
the inside of the sirloin, and was at his time little esteemed. 
He directed that it should never be cut while hot, but 
reserved entire for the hasJi, or a mock hare. The fillet 
was, however, also cut for steak. 

TJie ribs, called in the North the crop, are next in quality, 
although some j)eople prefer ribs to loin. A joint with the 
first three ribs (of one side) may weigh also from fifteen to 



PREPARATIONS OF BEEF 



429 



twenty pounds ; tlw fourth and fifth ribs approach the first 
three in weight. Eibs are more frequently boned and roUed, 
and then can be roasted before a smaller tire or in an oven, 
but require more time to get done. 

The rump^ or round, is divisible into two parts — the upper, 
which furnishes the best steaks, and is also used for roast- 
ing ; and the lower, or silver-side, which, like the undivided 
round, is mostly used for boiling, stewing, or braising. 

The aitch-bone, also spelled H-boiie, edge-bone (being the 
ischiadic bone), is a portion of the pelvic bone with the meat 
attached ; this is also used for boiling and stewing, the 
former in a salted state. 

The brisket is the part between the shoulders and fore- 
legs with the breast-bone. It contains the remarkable and 
tasty body of firm fat called kernel ; it is mostly used for 
boiling or stewing. 

The shoulder is the least esteemed part of the side, and 
most frequently stewed and boiled, and used for the pro- 
duction of gravy. 

The head of the ox is always divided in halves. The brain 
is not eatable. The rest is called ox-cheek, and braised or 
stewed. The tongue is one of the most delicate parts, and 
sold separately from the cheek. 

The tail of the ox is now a very expensive piece, its meat 
being paid for at a higher rate than rumpsteak. In the 
beginning of the century the tail was worth from sixpence 
to sevenpence only. 

Of the internal organs of the ox, called inside, the several 
stomachs and intestinal canal are boiled, and consumed 
under the name of tripe. The liver of the ox is not eatable 
for man, but given to dogs. 

The flesh of the thinner parts of the legs, shins, is mostly 
too hard and tendinous for roasting and boiling, and is used 
for the production of fresh beef -tea, broth, or gravy — hence 
called gravy beef. 



430 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



The feet of oxen, which, Uke those of cows, go under the 
description of coiv's heels, are boiled and eaten by fre- 
quenters of tripe-shops. French cooks make an accom- 
plished dish of them. 

Ox-heart is a favourite dish of some, but is rather of a 
pronounced taste, and very solid. 

The sioeethrcad, or iJancreas, of the ox, goes along with 
those of cows and calves to serve for the production of 
entrees. This part has become absurdly dear in large towns. 
Of steaks, three varieties are distinguished — one, prime, 
called rumjjsteak; the second quality, called beefsteak, 
coming from a lower part ; the third variety is a cross-cut 
from the under-cut, or fillet ; it has not the quality of 
rump or beef steak, but is more easily prepared in a tender 
state. 

The blood of the ox is not used for any preparation of 
food. 

Beef is best in winter, because it can be hung up as long 
as may be necessary to make it perfectly tender. The 
action of air upon beef, as upon all meat which has not 
been cooked or frozen, is the same as that which it exercises 
in the living body ; oxygen is absorbed, and carbonic acid 
exhaled. Concurrently, a certain amount of lactic acid 
forms in the meat, which during the subsequent cooking 
dissolves or softens the tendinous, fibrous, or tough parts. 
If the meat be intended for boiling, it may, while hung, be 
rubbed over with a little salt from time to time. Kernels 
so called, being lymphatic glands, should be cut out, and 
the cavities salted ; joints also should be cut into and 
salted. In warm weather, hung meat must be examined 
and rubbed over its surface with a dry, clean cloth daily ; 
by this practice the bacteria of excessive change are so 
kept under and hindered in their growth and multiphcation 
that they cannot affect the interior of the meat. 

The ox furnishes a delicious fat from the proximity of 



PRESERVA TION OF BEEF 431 

the kidney, suet, which is indispensable for many most 
important culinary operations. In America as well as 
Europe much beef - fat is transformed into a material 
closely resembling butter, and mainly sold under the 
name of oleo-margarine. Some Transatlantic traders have 
lately invented the name of marroiu for their tinned oleo- 
margarine. In South America some beef is preserved by 
drying, forming yarkec, corrupted into jerked heef ; great 
quantities of beef are preserved by salting, called junk; 
and by tinning, i.e., enclosing in tin boxes, and sterilizing 
by heat. 

Ox-kidney is not as hard as the liver, and not so unsuited 
for culinary preparation ; but even when well done it 
requires a good mastication and a strong digestion ; for, 
as it has a strong flavour, it requires a well-seasoned and 
browned espagnole sauce for its adaptation, and these 
concomitants are not within the range of toleration of 
delicate stomachs. 

The salting or loickling' of heef and the means by lohich it is 
effected involve important considerations. Beef is salted 
not only for preservation until it be wanted, but to im- 
prove or adapt its taste, and make it more tender. It 
may be rubbed with a mixture of salt, or a little saltpetre, 
or nitrate of potash, the latter to insure its having a little 
red colour. Cavities produced by the removal of bones or 
glands, called kernels, should also be rubbed and have 
some salt left in them, and be tied up again so as to keep 
the sides together. The mixture of salts dissolved in water 
may also be injected by means of a syringe with a pointed 
piercing nozzle ; but this causes the meat to be unequal 
in quality. The quantity of saltpetre or nitre to be used 
with the salt should be about 4 per cent, of the latter, or, 
in round numbers, 4 oz. to 6 lb. The saltpetre is not 
essential to preservation, but has reference only to the 
fixation of some of the red colour of the meat ; those who 



432 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



do not insist upon colour prefer to omit the saltpetre, 
because it has a flat, bitterish, cooling taste, and kills 
the savour of the meat ; to ourselves even the colour of 
the saltpetre pickled meat is objectionable, because it is 
frequently very unequally distributed. The pickle should 
also contain moist sugar to the amount of double the weight 
of the nitre, besides bay-leaves, savory, cloves, and mace, 
all well powdered. The meat should be rubbed with the 
pickle daily during five days, while preserved in a cool 
place. From the sixth day it will have formed a brine, in 
which it should be turned round at least once daily, xlbout 
the tenth day of pickling the meat will be ready for being 
boiled and eaten, in case it be intended to use it hot ; if it 
be intended to use the salt meat cold, it should remain 
in the pickle at least a fortnight. Such a pickle will pre- 
serve the meat for about three weeks. It extracts some 
albumin from the meat, and some osmazome, but the fibre 
and syntonin become more tender, and a savoury flavour 
is developed, which appears on boiling. On the other 
hand, some of the beefy musk flavour, which is objection- 
able to persons who have frequently to eat fresh or newly 
killed beef, e.g., soldiers in the field, is removed by the 
pickling. The use of salt beef, as of other salt provisions, 
is therefore partly a result of taste, partly of the necessity 
of making provision for a future day on which no fresh meat 
is obtainable. Next to bread, salt beef is the most im- 
portant part of ships' provisions. 

In case the salt beef is to be hung and dried, and, may 
be, smoked, the pickle is made to contain 12 per cent, of 
nitre, and 25 per cent, of moist sugar, leaving 63 per cent, 
for common salt. When hung and well aired, it will get 
dry in a fortnight, and keep for many months. 

Meat immersed in pickle gains weight. In an old ex- 
periment by Donkin and Gamble, there was a gain of 
3, in another of 2i, per cent. ; but in the common way of 



DRYING AND ROASTING OF BEEF 433 

salfcing, when the meat is not immersed in pickle, but 
yields some of its water to fuse the salt and form brine, 
there is a loss of from 1 lb. to \\ lb. in 16 lb., or from 
upwards of 6 to more than 9 per cent. 

The drying of fresh beef for the purpose of preserving it 
was apparently first practised in the dry climate of Perti 
and Chili, then in the Guaranis, later in Buenos Ayres ; 
the product was called yarkee by the Peruvians, which was 
altered by the French to charqui and tcharki, and by the 
English to jerked beef. Villaris, a pharmacist of Bordeaux, 
made many experiments on it, with the aid of an oven : 
1 lb. of meat becomes 4 oz. of dry material, which can be 
powdered, but not very finely. Eouelle and D'Arcis re- 
ported of Villaris's product that the bouillon and bouilli 
were equal to that from fresh meat. But further experience 
showed that meat thus dried in air at a temperature not 
exceeding 100° Fahr., or in the open air as yarkee, does not 
keep unaltered for any great length of time ; all yarkee we 
have ever tasted is rancid or tainted ; all beef-po2oder, even 
the best, we found to become tainted in smell and taste 
after a few weeks' most careful preservation in a tin in a 
dry place removed from all contamination. The use of 
dry beef-powder is, therefore, impracticable, apart from 
other objections. 

The principles of roasting as applicable to beef have been 
so fully developed in the general chapter, that we must not 
attempt to apply them in detail even to the Boast Sirloi7i of 
Beef Allow the rays of the fire to strike the beef during a 
quarter of an hour for every pound of weight which it 
shows ; thus, a sirloin of 15 lb. requires roasting during 
fifteen quarters of an hour, or three hours and three- 
quarters of an hour, and in winter four hours. If the same 
weight of joint be boned and rolled, it becomes more compact 
and thicker, though losing in weight at least one quarter, or 
perhaps 4 lb. ; yet this lighter mass of meat will require 

28 



434 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

a somewhat longer time to get done than the unboned joint, 
because the necessary roUing and tying together, to keep 
the meat juicy, prevents the heat from penetrating quickly 
to the interior, and heat has therefore to be applied for a 
longer time ; if this be omitted, the interior of the roll may 
be found underdone, or even raw. 

If a family or symbiotic company be small, even a sirloin 
of light weight, roasted at once, becomes gastronomically 
inconvenient. In such a case divide the joint as follows : 
Cut out the undercut or filUt, and dress it as a larded and 
braised entree ; or, after marinading it previously, dress it as 
what some older wiiters called mocU hare ; the marinading 
gives you time for postponing its use. Cut off the abdominal 
flaj) with the outer parts of the ribs, and stew it for pressed 
beef, or boil it with roots and rhizomes; or salt it slightly, 
and then stew and boil it ; from the main loin remove all 
excess of fat, which on the under side is suet, and use it for 
pudding, or fuse it out for other uses, such as frying. Now 
chop off the bodies of the vertebrae against which the fillet 
has been lying, and roast this tidy joint before the fire, 
protecting the ribs, exposed by the removal of the fillet, 
with suet and oiled paper. In this way a sirloin will give 
materials for three different hot dinners, plenty of variety, 
and enable the company to consume every part in an agree- 
able form. 

There are a number of variations of loins of beef, boned, 
rolled, and braised, bearing different names, which depend 
upon variations of garnish mainly. Thus, the roll may be 
garnished with a ragout a la Financidre or d la Flamandc, 
or a la Printanihre, or the garnish may consist of alternate 
groups of stewed peas and potatoes, turned in the shape of 
olives and fried. We beUeve that no joint has received so 
much attention, and so many skilful modifications, as the 
braised loin of beef. In several of the recipes which we 
have perused, a great excess of alcolwlic liquid is recom- 



LOIN AND FILLET OF BEEF 435 

mended to be added to the braised roll of beef. Allowing 
the roll to amount to 12 lb. of clear weight, there were to 
be added a bottle of red wine and two glassfuls, say 4 oz., 
of brandy, then the broth. After the beef had been braised 
for five hours, there were again to be added to the braise 
a glassful, or two glassfuls, of malaga or madeira. Such 
additions, or any addition of wine at all, are destructive of 
the essential element of braise, namely, the savour; no 
complicated additions, and no garnish, can ever be a set oif 
against any deficiency in the quality of the joint. 

Tim Fillet y or Under-cut, or Inside of Loin, the psoas 
muscle of the ox, is the tenderest flesh on the whole animal, 
and therefore preferred for many preparations, particularly 
in countries where beef is tough, owing to natural conditions 
or the necessity of early consumption. But the fillet is 
also relatively tasteless, and therefore by common consent 
receives a kind of culinary preparation which is to supple- 
ment that deficiency. It is always greatly improved by 
mere larding, when it is to be roasted by itself ; when it is 
roasted with the loin, larding is not to be advised, except in 
case the loin itself be also larded. It may also be marinaded, 
larded, braised, and variously prepared. When garnished 
with macaroni or ravioli, it passes by the name of a la 
Napolitaine ; when the macaroni are prepared separately 
with bechamel sauce and Parma cheese, the dish is called 
a la Milanaise. The fillet may be braised a la Jardinihre, 
or in a plain manner. In the latter form it was formerly 
called mock hare; later it was assimilated to the Con- 
tinental dressing of roebuck, and named a la Chevreuil. 
When neatly trimmed and closely larded, it should be put 
in a cold marinade of two parts vinegar with one part of 
water, pepper, bay-leaves, lemon, and some olive oil for two 
or three days, and turned over repeatedly, and then braised 
with all accompaniments. Here also we repeat the caution 
against the addition of wine : we have seen recipes directing 



436 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

the cook to moisten the braise with a bottle of sherry. Such 
excessive quantities are ahiiost absurd, but certainly destruc- 
tive of good cookery. Tliis application of excess of alcoholic 
liquids apparently pervades the later English culinary 
publications. It must needs yield bad sauce. Any sauce if 
too liquid, and not adhering to the morsel, will be of poor 
taste, and, besides, the bulk of the materials which would 
make it very tasty are lost by dilution, for they necessarily 
remain on the plates. The reducing of sauces to the suit- 
able degree of concentration, viscosity, or adhesiveness is 
one of the greatest arts of accomplished cooks ; on the 
other hand, it is a manifestation of bad cooking when a 
sauce, instead of being concentrated, is merely thickened 
with flour or eggs. Full-tasting sauces must be bound by 
these agents, for it is in the nature of a sauce (not of a 
gravy) to be thick and adhesive to the morsel ; but a thick 
sauce which is deficient in the gustatory elements is a 
negation of the principles and objects of a sauce, and there- 
fore tends to diminish the reputation of the cook or the 
estimation of culinary art. 

The fillet has received many variations of treatment ; 
flavoured with ailloUs, and served with tomatoes au gratin, 
it becomes a la Provencale ; garnished with green peas and 
crayfish tails, it is termed d la Parisienne ; it is supplied 
with various sauces, such as nivernaise or madeira, poiv- 
racle or csimgnolc ; there is the mode a la Bourgeoise, aux 
concombres, with glaced onions and stuffed lettuces, with 
pickles and jnixed fruit, etc. 

The Brisket of Beef, weighing from 9 to 10 lbs., is best 
salted and boiled ; but is also frequently stewed, and then 
glaced, and garnished in various ways. The flat bones 
are to be removed before glacing, or before dishing the 
piece. 

The liibs may be partially or entirely boned. Partial 
boning consists in the removal, by means of the saw and 



RIBS AND ROUND OF BEEF 437 



knife, of the spine bones, and in shortening the ribs on the 
side farthest from the spine, so as to leave them only about 
10 inches in length. When cojiijjletely boned, the soft parts 
are rolled, or collared, with the thick part of the meat inside 
and the flap from the chest wall outside, all being well tied 
and skewered. Eibs, whether boned or not, may be roasted 
plain, or salted, or brine-pickled and stewed, or braised in 
the various ways just considered. A perusal of many 
recipes has in the case of these preparations also convinced 
us that the materials include an excess of loine, half a bottle 
of madeira being generally the prescribed minimum. 

The name of the Aitch-bone of Beef is spelt in many 
ways, and the right mode of spelling it appears so difiticult 
to find that Dr. Kitchiner avoided the decision by writing 
H-bone. In Mrs. Mason's 'Ladies' Assistant' it was called 
Haunch-bone; in 'Domestic Management,' Aitch-bone; in 
Eeynolds' ' Cookery,' Ische-bone ; in Henderson's 'Cookery,' 
Edge-bone; in Mrs. Lydia Fisher's 'Prudent Housewife,' 
Ach-bone ; in Mrs. Mclver's ' Cookery,' Hook-bone. Kitchiner 
had also seen it spelled Each-bone and Bidge-bone, and heard 
it called Natch-bone. Most London butchers spell it Aitch- 
bone, but we are inclined to believe Eeynolds' Ische-bone 
might be correct, as being the iVnglicized form of Ischiadic 
bone, the hip-bone. As in the case of ribs, the meat bears 
the name of the bone to which it is attached. 

The Bound of Beef is mostly salted and boiled, latterly, 
with the aid of the improved cooking-ranges, not rarely 
braised, a form in which we prefer it to the boiled. The 
braising should be begun with standard broth, and be 
effected in a well-heated oven in a closed braising-pan. If 
no such pan be at hand, cover the joint with a coat of 
dough. 

The Sjjortsmaiis Bound, or Bceif de Chasse, is the ancient 
title of the largest joint that graces the table of hunting- 
parties. The name has been limited to the narrow title of 



438 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



* Hunting Beef,' and, worse still, to the inappropriate sur- 
name of a la Chasseur. The recipes for its preparation from 
the beginning of last century, which we have compared, 
surpass in care and completeness all others of which we 
have cogaisance. This comparison has convinced us even 
more forcibly than many others, that culinary literature has 
been, so to say, ' cockneyfied ' in a lamentable manner, and 
has thereby lost much of the freshness and the grandeur of 
country customs. 

A preparation of the Flanks of Beef is called Collared Beef. 
In cookery-books, which are now approaching their centenary, 
we find many meat and fish preparations designated as 
collared. Many of these in newer works are termed * rolled,' 
from which the equivalence of collared and rolled may be 
inferred. But a number of dishes were anciently or are still 
called collared, there being in the manipulation to which 
they are subjected no item which could explain the adjec- 
tive. In these cases we suppose the adjective to have been 
acquired by the similarity of the collateral treatment pre- 
ceding or following the rolling. Amongst the collared 
dishes of distinction are : Collared Eel, Collared Sucking- 
pig, Calf's-head collared in imitation of Braion, Collared 
Pig's-head, and a dish termed Small Collars, made of the 
feet and ears of large pigs, representing a kind of brawn. 
What is now mostly called a Boll of Beef, or Collared Beef, 
is made more often of the flank. When it is not rolled, but 
kept flat, it is called Pressed Beef. 

The Biinij) of Beef a la Daube is important, as it exhibits 
the different meanings of two very similar words, the French 
substantive daube, a stew, and the English verb to daub, 
meaning to lard (probably in a peculiar rough way differing 
from the finer larding). Example, Gigot a la I>aube = \eg of 
mutton stewed. The French verb dauber has no culinary 
application. In some books, to daube (with the final e) is 
used as equivalent to larding, or, as an author has it, ifiter- 



PREPARATIONS OF BEEF 439 

larding, a confusion with a literary expression. The EngHsh 
expression is to daub, without the final e. Thus we have 
daubed foivls, which are braised, and not larded (Simpson, 
p. 337), and we have Foivl a la Daubc, larded {ibid., p. 338), 
which is to be finished like Foivl 11 la Daube (p. 29), which 
is not larded. Simpson (p. 76) has, further. Bump of Beef a 
la Daube, the recipe for which begins thus : ' Trim a rump 
of beef, take the bone out, daub it ' {i.e., the rump, not the 
bone), * and put it into a marinade.' Here ' to daub ' must 
mean * to lard.' On p. 110 ibid., the rump of veal is to be 
daubed the same as rump of beef. Simpson describes 
only beef and veal as daubed, fowls, etc., always as larded, 
from which it is seen that in the beginning of last century 
daubing was a particular kinding of larding, or at all events 
included it. A vessel for stewing in this particular way is 
in France termed a daubiere. 

Beef a la Mode was, and to some extent still is, a speciality 
of certain popular eating-houses. Dr. Kitchiner in his 
analysis of 180 works on cookery, could not find one recipe 
that approximated to anything like an accurate description 
of the way in which this dish is actually dressed in the 
a la mode beef-shops. From these latter, he continues, it 
was of course impossible to obtain any information. The 
whole secret seemed to him to be the thickening of the 
gravy of beef that has been very slowly stewed, and 
flavoured with bay leaves and allspice. The process of this 
slow stewing he illustrates by a quotation from the ' Tabella, 
Cibaria,' p. 47 : * It must be allowed to muse gently for 
several hours, inaccessible to the ambient air, and on the 
even and persevering heat of charcoal in furnace or stove. 
After having lulled itself in its own exudations, and the 
dissolution of its auxiliaries, it may appear at table with a 
powerful claim to approbation.' The lull was no doubt 
preceded by excitement with delirium, of which ' a filet ' 
entered the ink of the Tabulist. The success of the a la 



440 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

mode beef, as of nearly all stewed, fried, and roast beef, is 
due (wherever it is attained by quality) to the production 
of the true aroma or savour of the beef by gratination or 
real braising, the intensifying of the savoury ingredient, 
osmazome, by skilful browning, the production of the essence 
of gravy, the caramel of meat extract. This not being a 
question of expenditure of money, but of the application of 
skill, its solution goes in praise of the cooks in these shops, 
which are of many qualities, but always supply a great 
want of the community, namely, that for savoury meals. 
A la mode beef is mostly made from the mouse-buttock, or 
clod of beef (or the blade-bone, the sticking piece, or the 
breast of veal). The meat is all cut up into pieces of 
three to four ounces each. 

Sjnced Beef is not a very specific form, but the method 
of its production is applicable to many pieces. It is eaten 
cold only. In salting it should be spiced with the tinctures 
rather than the powders, as they yield a more equally 
penetrated product. 

Bubble and Squeak is mostly made from the remains of 
boiled salt beef which has served its main purpose on the 
table. It is essentially a fry, the boiled cabbage which 
becomes part of it being also fried, and owing to its excess 
of water causing the squeaking and bubbling. 

Hashed Beef and Broiled Bones are favourites of many ; 
the latter are particularly patronized for breakfast on board 
of our great steamers. 

We have now to consider various lyreimrations of beef used 
as entrees. The head of the ox in England is not properly 
butcher's meat, but goes to the tripe-shop. It is very 
unwieldy, and should always be boned before being brought 
to the kitchen. It should then be soaked, first in warm 
water for three hours, then in cold during the entire night 
following (Kitchiner). This is required to remove the 
strong natural flavour of the part. It may also be neces- 



ENTREES OF BEEF 441 



sary on account of the experience which the ox-head has to 
make between the kiUing and the tripe-shop. According to 
Kitchiner, an ox-cheek requires, when not boned, three 
hours' boihng before the tissues come off the bones. He 
nevertheless terms it an economical dish. In the military 
kitchens at Aldershot the ox-cheeks are incorporated in a 
brawn, the prime cost of which is a penny halfpenny the 
pound. The ox-cheek admits of several forms of prepara- 
tion : of braising, pressing, cooling and trimming, cutting 
into slices, and dressing with beetroot sauce {a la Polonaise), 
or when braised, crumbing and baking, and serving with 
sweet sauce {a VAllemande), or stuffing with forcemeat, 
frying, garnishing with eggs, and serving with Portuyuese 
sweet sauce. Of this mode of frying the braised cheek in 
a covering of sauce {e.g., Atelet), and a crumbing with cheese 
and butter, there are many varieties. Ox-cheek braised 
may also be cut in twelve pieces of equal size, or * hand- 
some pieces fit to help at table,' and stew^ed, to be finished 
with different garnishes, and accompanied with a puree of 
green peas or haricot beans. Several other forms, e.g., a 
la Provencale, a la Soubise, a la Bretonne, etc., are too 
strongly flavoured. The London consumers of ox-cheek 
generally drow^n it in onions. 

Kitchiner gives a long recipe for Ox-head Soup, which is 
laborious ; the small-cut meat, etc., remains in the soup ; 
this, therefore, amounts to an ensouped ragout. It requires 
two dozen berries of allspice. 

Of Ox-palates * Dons de Comus ' says : ' The ox-palate is 
only a trifle by itself, but culinary art gives it value, and 
causes it often to be preferred to excellent and more expen- 
sive things.' This membranous covering of the palate of 
the ox is a layer of white fibrous tissue, fixed to the bony 
roof of the mouth, and covered on the side towards the 
tongue by a thin mucous membrane. It is corrugated from 
side to side, the corrugations being divided by a furrow 



442 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



running down the palate in the median line. Each corruga- 
tion or fold is crenulated at its free margin ; each half of the 
palate has sixteen corrugations, the whole, therefore, thirty- 
two. These arrangements give to the dressed ox-palate and 
its slices a very characteristic pattern. Many palates are 
perfectly unpigmented, and these should be chosen for white 
sauce accompaniment ; some, however, are piebald, with 
greater or smaller patches of pigment, brown or black in 
colour. These spots, if confined to the middle, when they 
are called in French cliiriUon clu milieu (' Dons de Comus,' i., 
p. 156), or not too large in area, maybe cut out if they affect 
the appearance of the dish ; they never affect its taste or 
quality, and rather lend depth to a brown sauce. In the 
principal culinary works of the seventeenth and early parts 
of the eighteenth century ox-palates are not treated, so that 
neither De Varennes nor La Chapelle mentions them. They 
appear on the literary scene with ' Dons de Comus,' and 
receive at once thirteen different kinds of treatment ; of 
these Beauvilliers retained seven, Gouffe only one. All 
recipes, wherever described, are after * Dons de Comus,' 
except one, which is a generalization with curry. 

Ox-palates require a general preparation for the removal 
of the mucous membrane, which if left gives them a ragged 
appearance. This may be done quickly by skilful grilling, 
or more slowly and securely by boiling in water and scrap- 
ing ; the hard border directed to the lip, and the flesh 
belonging to the soft palate, should be cut off" and removed. 
Clean and parboil the palates thus dressed ; boil them in an 
aromatised blanc for three or four hours until they are so 
tender that they can be easily cut with a fork or spoon. 
Then cut them in two along the median line, and in oblong 
squares to suit the dish, or to any size required by sub- 
sequent dressing. 

Covered with farce, rolled, and gratinated, they become 
canelofis. When a number of such canelons, say six, are 



PREPARATIONS OF OX-PALATES 443 



enclosed in a buttered paper and tied up, the bundle is 
called a paupiette (also spelled popiette). Such paupiettes 
may be boiled in broth, drained on paper, and sent to table 
with the canelons enclosed ; or the canelons maybe removed 
from the envelope, and served with financierc sauce. The 
palates may be accommodated with Italian hroivn or 
espagnolc sauce; with white vcloutc sauce {a la Poidette); 
they may be made into a salpicon, bound with egg-yolks, 
egged, crumbed and fried as croquettes. With salpicon 
.wrapped in sliced calf's udder or pir/s caul, they are termed 
en Cracovie. Stewed in brown sauce they become a la 
Lyonnaise. Sandwiched with ham and grilled, they are 
termed au Chingaras, meaning after the manner of the 
gipsies (Zingaras). Of this expression an author has made 
au chien gras. Minced, called en menus droits, or en allu- 
mettes, the palates may be fried with additions, and covered 
with allemande or espagnole sauce ; but this ragout suffers 
from the want of external appearance. They may be dressed 
with the sauce best adapted to the ragout of calf's head, 
Tete de Veau en Tortue (falsely termed h la tortue), and then 
also pass as en tortue ; in this form they are very much like 
the thinner flaps of turtle. They may be made in a ragout 
with truffles and mushrooms, and served in paper capsules. 
Ox-palates en Hatereau require a light and fine farce, and 
covering with a batter, and frying in flowing fat."*^ For the 
form called en Hatelettes a good synonym would be on 
skewers or as huhahs. There are other forms, but not 
characteristic, such as a la Bavigote, au Parmesan. The 
classic forms have a social significance not difficult to appre- 
ciate, for if they are tasty they remain light entertainments, 
gustatory amusements, of the class of entrees, which are not 

* An attereau or hatereau was originally a dish made of stewed veal and 
pork, a popular ragoAt at home in the Bretagne. The recipe which is 
given by Francatelli, N. 825, for ^ Attereaiix (surnamed d la Duxelles),' is 
the result of a confusion of an hatereau with an hatelette. Both were given 
originally in 'Dons de Comus,' i., pp. 158, 162. 



444 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

likely to molest the gastric function. An authoress who 
terms them * beef-palates ' attributes to them the quality of 
favourite entrees. Like turtle, calf's head, pied de boeuf, or 
beche de mer, they are tasteless in themselves, and depend 
for their development upon the sauce and garnish. As to 
their attractiveness when well prepared, we agree with 'Dons 
de Comus.' 

Tlie Philosophy of Beefsteak or Bumpsteah forms a power- 
ful contrast to the trifles of the foregoing paragraph. Beau- 
villiers"* speaks of * le veritable bifteck, comme il se fait en 
Angleterre,' and of the other variety, which he says is called 
* Eomesteak,' and assures the 'amateurs de bonne chere ' 
that it would be worth their while to cross the Channel to 
taste this favourite English dish, which, when * mortifie 
a son point,' and well dressed, according to him, is superior 
to most of the subtle double relishes of the Parisian 
kitchen. 

Beef and rump steak are intimately associated with the 
history of the training of pugilists. The celebrated trainer 
Sir Thomas Parkyns,t Bart., of Bunny Park, greatly pre- 
ferred beef-eaters to shcep-hiters, as he called those who ate 
mutton. On the other hand, when Humphries, the pugilist, 
was trained by Eipsham, the keeper of Ipswich Gaol, he was 
at first fed upon beef, but got so much flesh that the beef 
was changed for mutton, roasted or boiled. To this 
Kitchiner observes, apparently as an explanation of this 
story, that by boiling a great part of the nutritive juices of 
the meat was extracted. This relative loss by boiling or 
roasting has never been accurately estimated, and is probably 
not very great. The season for steaks used to be from 
September 29 to March 25, but since the introduction of 
processes of refrigeration, tolerable steak is obtained even 
during the summer months.

BEEFSTEAK AND RUMPSTEAK 445 

Rumpsteak is the most suitable part of beef for broiling, 
as it is cut right across the grain, contains no bones, hardly 
any fibrous, sinewy, or aponeurotic parts, and is mostly 
tender. Although rumpsteak is actually beefsteak, yet the 
meat which is called beefsteak at the butcher's shop is an 
inferior description of beef, inferior certainly to, and lower 
in price than, rumpsteak. A cut across the loin of beef, 
corresponding to a chop from mutton, is also very suitable 
for broiling. In the fourth rank, as regards taste and 
flavour, stands the steak obtained by cutting the fillet across 
the grain, which is much used in Germany and France*; 
it has the advantage of being mostly tender. Formerly 
there was much discussion on the question whether steak 
should be beaten before being broiled or not. Kitchiner, 
e.g., was strongly opposed to it, and called the procedure ' a 
vulgar trick,' which broke the cells in which the gravy of 
the meat was contained, whereupon it became dry and 
tasteless. This assertion cannot be maintained, as the 
sacculi of the flesh fibres, the only objects that could be 
meant by * gravy-cells,' do not yield any liquid to beating. 
Others, again, insist strongly on the necessity of beating 
meat. It has a certain advantage in this, that it makes a 
cut of unequal thickness a little more equal. Steak of un- 
equal thickness should be separated into the thinner and 
thicker part, and each should be broiled during the time 
required by its particular size. For broiling a very clear 
fire is indispensable, and this was assured by a little super- 
stition, namely, that the steak should not be put on until a 
little salt thrown into the fire produced a blue flame. Steak 
should be an inch thick, and broiled rapidly ; if it is to be 
well done, and not underdone, the final cooking must be 

* Gouflfe, loc. ciL, p. 140, says that 'bifteck' ought always to be taken 
fiom the fillet, and that grills taken from other parts of the ox * ought not 
to receive the denomination of '' hifteck.'" ' He knows not ' Rometeck,' 
makes his ' hifteck ' four centimetres thick, beats it lightly, and grills it for 
eight minutes. 



446 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

given after the first rapid broiling has coagulated the outside ; 
then the steak bears slower ripening before the fire without 
becoming dry. Steak can be fried in a pan, and is then 
called pan-steak ; if the fat and pan are hot enough, the 
steak is equal in quality to grilled steak, but a slow pan 
leaves it flabby. For frying, steak may be cut thinner than 
for grilling. 

The parts of beef ordinarily called steak, ^ meaning ' piece,' 
may be prepared in many ways — by steicing with various 
garnishes, as kehohs or khnhabs ; as mince, in Spanish or 
Peninsular sauce ; hashed, in cassarij) sauce ; hashed and 
braised, stewed in a baked pie, or in a boiled pudding. 

Ox-tongue may be dressed in the fresh state in all the 
modes applicable to beef, and is particularly tender when 
braised or stewed. More commonly, however, it is pickled 
before use, in various degrees of intensity. When it has 
been pickled, and not been taken out of the pickle for 
drying, it is called green. Such a tongue requires only a 
few hours' soaking in cold water, gradual heating to ebulH- 
tion, and then gentle simmering for from three and a half 
to four hours. When a pickled tongue has been dried, and 
perhaps smoked, and is stiff and hard, it requires as much 
as twenty-four hours' soaking in water before heat may be 
applied to it. 

Of Triije, Kitchiner says that it holds the same rank 
amongst solids that water-gruel does amongst soups. It 
is no doubt tasteless in itself, and if the non-striped 
muscular fibres contained in its walls (the tripe here con- 
sidered comes from the rumen, or first stomach of the ox) 
did contain any little savoury material, it must be lost in 
the difficult process of its preparation and boiling. It 
remains, therefore, mainly a body of connective tissue, and 
has to be boiled until it is nearly ready to dissolve to 
gelatine. It has to be bought at the tripe-shop, in the 

* See Steak in the Vocabulary at the end of the volume. 



OX-TONGUE, TRIPE, AND COWS' HEELS 447 



boiled state, and has to be reboiled in milk, at least for an 
hour. It must then be made tasty by sauces or garnishes, 
and is therefore frequently favoured with abundance of 
onions. According to Homer, tripe was one of the dishes 
presented to the guests at the feast of Achilles, k French 
name for tripe is Gvas double. A recipe for its preparation 
a la Mode de Caen, by Vuillemot, is remarkable by requiring 
as a garnish twelve blanched sheep's feet, and, amongst a 
heap of other vegetables, twelve heads of leek, a bottle of 
wine, and a glass of cognac, for its coction. Some prepare 
tripe like a fricassee ; others fry it in butter. The Dutch 
mix it with minced beef and other ingredients, and make 
brawn of it ; such brawn they also fry, when desirous of 
having it warm. The Dutch name of this brawn is 
Bolpens. 

The Feet of Oxen, Cows, and Neats, all go by the name of 
Coios' Heels. This shows that there is not much difference 
in their quality as food. They are generally bought ready 
boiled at the tripe-shop. In the private kitchen they are 
further boiled until all the bones can be removed, and the 
semi-gelatinous matter is then stewed gently in a savoury 
sauce. Under the title of Le Pied de Bceuf Poulette, Vuille- 
mot gives a recipe which is noteworthy. The cow's heel is 
to be wrapped in washed selvage, and boiled with vegetables 
and spices. The bandage being removed, it is covered with 
allemande sauce, with mushrooms, parsley, lemon and 
butter. A cow's heel suffices for six persons with a good 
appetite. ' Ce plat par son confortable, est tres recherche,' 
says this experienced cook.

CHAPTEE XXXVII. 

PREPARATIONS OF VEAL. 

Yeal is the great historical object of the cookery of the 
French, which can be understood thereby ; it is not so in 
England, where calves are killed much later, i,e., at a more 
advanced age than on the Continent, and the use of beef 
prevails greatly over that of veal. There was in existence 
in France a law according to which calves were not to be 
killed under the age of six w^eeks ; but this law was little 
observed, and where it was, calves were not allowed to 
outlive the span of allotted time. The recipes for French 
preparations of veal are, of course, adapted to the size of 
the joints, and such recipes translated into English without 
adaptation would refer to objects of such large proportions 
that their treatment would become, if not impossible, at 
least very difficult. 

It follows that the anatomical division of the calf, as 
effected by the butcher in England, differs considerably 
from that usual on the Continent. The animal, from which 
the head has been severed entire, is divided lengthways by 
a perpendicular section in two halves, sides, and these are 
divided into fotcr quarters. Each anterior or fore quarter 
consists of a neck, which is in reality half a neck ; a 
shoulder, being in reality the shoulder-blade wnth adherent 
flesh ; the back, or carrd, from which the cotelettes j^foijer are 
made ; and the breast or ribs of veal, which includes the 
anterior part, or brisket, with the tasty firm fat called 
kernel, and the rib cartilages near the sternum,* or breast- 
bone, called in French tendrons. The dividing-line of the fore 
and hind quarters follows pretty nearly the natural division 
into chest and abdomen, as indicated by the diaphragm or 



PREPARATIONS OF VEAL 449 

midriff. The hind-quarter begins close to the anterior end 
of the kidney, which marks the loin or kidney-piece ; the 
inner part of the hind-leg in cow-calves, including the udder, 
is called ntct ; the thin end with the hock-joint is called 
knuckle ; the thick part of the leg is mostly cut up in slices 
perpendicular to the bone, and such a slice in London is 
called fillet — quite falsely, we admit, but the use of the word 
cannot be avoided. 

A Hind-leg of Veal, properly called a Leg of Veal, in 
France and Germany weighs from 12 to 15 lb., in England 
two or three times that amount. On this section of the 
veal there are three parts, which are called nut, or noix in 
French. The first nut is the ciishion, or mo^ise-piece, which 
is just inside the leg, and the fattest and tenderest part. It 
is taken off in a technical manner which we need not 
describe. After having removed this, the butcher takes 
out the under -cushion, or under-mit, in French sour-noix. 
Then there is a third nut, called noix dti pdtissier, which is 
near the rump or buttock, at the base of the tail, called by 
German butchers and cooks the pasty-piece — Pastetenstilck. 
This latter is the piece which in the ox is called the fillet, 
or under-cut, but in the calf is not so called. As a matter 
of fact, some French cookery-books have no dish called 
' Fillet of Veal,' but have several preparations called of 
' Noix de Veau.' 

These varieties of cushions, or noix, have to be dis- 
tinguished in cookery, because they are used for different 
purposes if choice be free. The cushion, or nut, generally 
makes an entree ; the under -cushion, sour-noix, is used for 
making godiveaus and cooked farces ; the noix du patissier, 
or under-cut, goes to make godiveaus, and its ends veloutd, 
or sauce tournde. The chump end and the remaining parts 
of the flesh may help to make an espagnole. The expres- 
sion 'fillet part of the neck,' which occurs in some writers, 
could only mean the mass of flesh on the back above the 

29 



450 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



shoulder-blades, on both sides of the spinous processes of 
the vertebral column, cut away from the bone. 

lioin of Veal, in French longe, is that part of the calf to 
which the kidney adheres. It is cut three inches shorter 
than the haunch ; the side, or ventral flap, is rolled inwards, 
and fastened with skewers, in order that the loin may be 
square, and not have the appearance of being thicker at 
one end than at the other. The same object is served by 
taking out the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae, 
which are near the kidney. 

The lungs, popularly lights, because they float on water, 
are in French called mou. The calf's i:>luck in French is 
f raise cle veau. Tendrons, so frequently mentioned in 
French cookery-books as delicacies, are the soft cartilages of 
the ribs near the breast-bone. In some French and English 
cookery-books of the present century they are persistently 
called tendons, an error which, with inexperienced persons, 
is liable to lead to relatively grave misunderstandings, 
tendons being sineios, or the thin flexible ropes by which 
muscles bend and straighten limbs at distances from their 
position. 

It is uncertain whether the last syllable of godiveau is 
derived from, or has reference to, the flesh of the calf. 
No more can we state the derivation of popiettes or paupi- 
ettes — Italian polpettes — de veau, expressions which, like 
several others used, though more rarely, in culinary practice, 
are not registered in dictionaries. 

The preparations of Calf's Head are numerous and in- 
teresting. It is most frequently boiled, even when further 
prepared afterwards. Plain-boiled Calf's Head looks better 
on the dish if it be white, and not covered with large or 
small patches of pigment from a natural piebald condition 
of the skin. For calf's head which is to be served in 
espagnole or any other brown sauce, the colour of the skin 
of the head is indifferent. The head may be partially boned 



PREPARATIONS OF CALF'S HEAD 451 

before being boiled, or be boiled entire and subsequently 
boned. 

For braising Calf's Head it should be parboiled, then 
boned and cut into suitable slices, the ears being cut out 
together with a ring, which is to enable them to stand 
upright on the ragout dish ; the tongue is left entire, to be 
carved on the table ; the brain is cut in dice, and used 
as garnish to the dish. The variations which have been 
applied consist mainly in changes concerning the con- 
stituents of the sauce. From poivrade, or ravigote, and poor 
man's sauce, to Italian or tomato sauce, many varieties 
may be used, but a good espagnole will perhaps be preferred 
by most people. Some recipes prescribe to boil tJie brain in 
a mixture of vinegar and water, with salt, and fat, and with- 
out mincing it, to make a longitudinal incision into each 
half of the brain, and then pour the sauce selected over it. 
Other recipes inculcate the addition of much wine to the 
braise ; others, again, advise the calf's head to be garnished 
with fried eggs and croiUons, or propose a trophy of a 
croustade on which the tongue is to be presented. Such 
additions and ornamentations are applicable on special 
occasions, but add nothing to the essential qualities of the 
dish. 

Calf's head, being somewhat tasteless in itself, requires 
always a savoury sauce, sometimes an addition oi forcemeat ; 
with the latter it may conveniently be stuffed. For this pur- 
pose it is parboiled and boned, all the apertures are closed by 
sutures, the farce and the tongue are placed inside it as into 
a sack, and this is closed at the neck-end by sutures ; it is 
wrapped in a cloth, bound and sewed up, and braised with 
all accompaniments. Cloth and sutures are removed, and 
the head is dished w4th espagnole or a ragout made with 
this sauce and suitable additions. As a variation, the 
braised head may be sauced, crumbed, and baked. Some 
ancient English recipes give two steps for preparing the 



452 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

sack for receiving the farce — the first is shinning ; the 
second, honing. In this way all other solids of the head 
are isolated, and can be mixed with the farce. 

Calf's Head en Tortue is, in some cookery-books, miscalled 
a la Tortue. The parboiled and boned calf's head is cut 
in twelve pieces, and finished in a ragout en tortue. 

Calf's Head stuffed with Farce, after the manner of Puits 
Certain, is a somewhat fanciful preparation, inasmuch as 
the eyes are made an object of culinary preparation, and 
the brain cavity is filled with farce. 

Calf's Head in Plain BagoUt a la Poulette, m Breadcrumb 
a la Ste. MenShould, and/ne^, are esteemed dishes. 

Calf's Brain is very tasteless by itself, but a good vehicle 
of even mild flavours and bland white sauces, and absolutely 
tender. When brain is fried, as in a recipe for scollops, it 
evolves a very fine osmazome flavour, superior to that of 
any game or meat. But the frying must be managed most 
carefully, as the least over-heating is destructive of the 
flavour. In Fried Calf's Brain the Spaniards excel. 
Braised and gratinated in Scollop Shells is a form which 
admits of the introduction of tasty and aromatic elements. 
Steived a VAllemande is a form much used in South 
Germany ; while the French dress it en mdtelote, or with 
ravigote sauce. 

It may be mariiiaded in diluted vinegar, and fried in 
hatter ; or it may be steioed, and accommodated with hroion 
hutter as a sauce. Or the stewed brain, suitably divided, 
may be steeped in a thick sauce, lorappcd in caul, and haked 
in the oven. Stewed brain may also be given as a cold dish 
in a mayonnaise, a dish which, when flavoured with garlic, 
is termed d la Provenqale. 

Calf's Ears are a fancy dish much like tendrons, lamb's 
feet, and similar extreme ends of animals used for food, and 
require much work in their preparation. The ears, having 
been fully prepared by the butcher, are to be parboiled, 



CALF'S TONGUE, LIVER, AND SWEETBREAD 453 



braised, and perfectly cooked, and then all the sojt skin is to 
be scraped off, and the luliite gristle, meaning the cartilage, 
only is to be left as the part to be eaten, the only digestible 
part being thus rejected, and the indigestible retained. One 
of the recipes containing such extreme directions is entitled 
a la Tortue, but should be en Torttie if there were any 
resemblance to any turtle preparations about it ; it is a 
title of no significance, and should be expunged. Ears may 
be stuffed and fried in batter, or marinaded and fried, or 
steived, crumbed, and baked d la Ste. Menehould, or fried 
with mushrooms. 

Calf's Tongue is prepared generally like ox-tongue. 
Calf's Lights {mou de vea^c) are stewed. The Pluck includes 
heart and liver as well as lights. It is first scalded, then 
braised ; it may also be curried or fried. 

Calf's Liver fried is an excellent dish, on account of the 
osmazome which it forms during frying. The slices should 
be of equal thickness and size, well dredged with flour, and 
fried thoroughly, but not hard. A favourite addition is 
fried bacon, which enhances the taste. French recipes for 
sauces are mostly good, except such as d la poele, to which 
a pint of wine is to be added. Braised Calf's Liver is an 
accomplished dish, and a regular piece of art is the Larded 
Liver roast as a lohole on the spit. It should be covered 
with a buttered paper, and thus really roasted en papillote. 
Liver and Baco7i, in French pain de foie de veau, is baked 
in a mould. 

The Sweetbread, or Pancreas, is a secretory gland which 
lies close to the liver, and sends its secretion, the pancreatic 
juice, into the upper part of the intestinal canal, through a 
duct which opens close to the gall-duct. In its uncooked 
state, the pancreas has powerful digestive effects upon flesh, 
milk, starch, and similar substances. But these powers are 
destroyed by boiling, and sweetbread is eaten, not for any 
peptic effect, but for its delicate flavour and its invariable 



454 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

tenderness. The sweetbreads of adult bovines are also very 
good, and, owing to their size, offer better opportunities for 
preparation. In French, all sweetbread, whether from calves, 
cows, or oxen, is called ris de veau, a name the derivation 
of which is not very certain. In dictionaries the word is 
ranged under ris, laughter. 

Sweetbread may be larded and braised, and dished with 
espagnole ; or it may be cut into hehohs (kMcbabs), skewered, 
and braised — Hdtelets de Bis de Vea^i ; or it may be made 
into a ragout, and offered in a pudding-case. It may be 
crumbed and baked; prepared with mushrooms and truffles; 
as fricandeau ; glaced ; in croquettes or en cassolettes ; in 
X>apillotes, and various other forms. 

Calf's Kidneys are minced and braised, and go well with 
a brown sauce. 

Tendrons of Veal have already been alluded to above. 
The French word tendron^ in its widest significance, means 
gristle ; but in Smith and Hamilton's Dictionary ' gristle ' 
is not translated back into French tendron, but into cartilage. 
Popularly, tendinous parts of joints are termed gristle, but 
they cannot also be termed tendrons. The necessity for 
the discussion of this terminology will be understood from 
the fact that, in several English and French works, the 
term tendrons is persistently given as tendons,"^ meaning a 
totally different thing — namely, sineivs. Tendrons, then, in 
our system, implies the cartilages which intervene between 
the breast-bone and the ribs attached thereto. If ever the 
word had, or has, any other significance, such will, for the 
purposes of this work, be excluded from consideration. 

Tendrons are dressed a la ijoulette, in shape of jjeacoch's 
tail, in macedoine, in mayonnaise, in ravigote, marinaded and 

* Beauvilliers is, according to my observation, the first who persistently, 
through nine recipes, erroneously writes tendons, instead of tendrons. 
The error, now nearly a century old, has been introduced into nearly all 
French and English cookery-books. Rottenhijfer gives nineteen recipes 
for tendrons, and spells the word correctly. 



VARIOUS PREPARATIONS OF VEAL 455 

fried, twice covered loiih crumhs and hatter and fried, in a 
casserole of rice, as ragoiU, en mdtelote, a la jardiniere, etc. 

These cartilages, although quite indigestible, are fancied 
as dishes ; probably sonie pleasure is derived from crunching 
a somewhat resistent, yet frangible, substance, in the presence 
of a tasty sauce. 

Kernels of Veal are lymphatic glands, cut out of joints 
and mesentery [petits noix — e.g.y d'epaule de veau) ; they 
may be braised and treated like sweetbread. 

The Grenade, or Granada, or Granadin of Veal is a dish 
of German origin — an imitation of the structure of a Spanish 
small bomb filled with gunpowder and small missiles. In 
French culinary literature the dish was gradually lost ; but 
a modification of the name survived in objects which had 
no bearing upon the name, and in no way justified or 
explained it. The dish should perhaps be placed under 
the chapter referring to Pdtes Chaitds, or Timbales. 

Wliite Veal Collops, or Slices, are a neat supper dish, and 
do not take up much time for their preparation. When 
intended to be served up in form, the addition of egg-balls, 
forcemeat -balls, and mushrooms will be advisable. There 
is a distinct Enghsh form of this dish to be placed round a 
ragout of godiveau. 

Popiettes or Paupiettes of Veal are rolled thin scollops, 
enclosing a cooked farce of veal or fowl, braised, and covered 
with espagnole. 

Hdtelcts of Veal are such popiettes fixed on skewers 
{hdtelcts), and roasted in oiled paper. (These are erroneously 
termed hdtereaux by Beauvilliers, i. 161.) 

Cushion of Veal may be stewed plain, or as glaced 
fricandeau. A form for which it is sliced and stuffed is 
called Manchons de Veau d la Gerard. The rolled stuffed 
pieces have the shape of little muffs — hence the name. 
This dish was the result of the effort which an assistant- 
cook [aide aux entrees) of Madame de Pompadour made 



456 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

when desired to produce a mets that should bear her name. 
Just before writing the inenUy he thought the materials too 
simple for the purpose, and therefore gave to the dish his 
own name. In consequence, an inappropriate, or miscarried, 
or otherwise objectionable dish, is sometimes called d la 
Gerard. 

Of the Shoulder of Veal there are many preparations. 
The Savoury SJioulder of Veal given by Ignotus requires 
great attention and skill on the part of the cook ; so does 
the French form, boned, larded, and braised with the seven 
roots. It may be given the form of a bagpipe. According 
to Dumas, there is extant a letter by Voiture to his friend 
Costar in which the poet of Anne of Austria describes the 
high estimation in which he held this dish. The boned 
shoulder may also receive the form of a galantine. Most 
commonly the shoulder is provided with some stufl&ng and 
roasted. 

The other preparations of veal repeat the features of the 
foregoing ones. The Neck is roast, or braised, or sauced^ 
crumbed, and baked. The Breast of Veal is best stewed, or 
dressed in form of collops, or kebobs, with green peas ; it 
may be stuffed, braised, or roasted. It contains or yields 
the tendrons, or rib cartilages, of which we have treated 
above ; it may also be boned, stuffed, rolled, and braised. 

The Loin of Veal, French longe, is frequently used boned, 
i.e., filleted; it may be eaten in the plain roast form, or 
further treated in various ways. 

Veal Cutlets (cotelettes) properly so called should be trans- 
versal sections of the back of the calf carrying ribs ; such are 
easily made on the carcases of young calves, but when made 
of larger animals becomes unwieldy, or require much trim- 
ming to be brought to a desirable size. For this reason 
cutlets in this country are mostly made out of the solid 
sections of the leg, such as the French call troTiqons, while 
in London, at least, they are sold under the entirely false 



PREPARATIONS OF VEAL AND OF MUTTON 457 

name of fillets. Thus, cutlets become mere slices, collops, 
and have no longer any connection with ribs. They are liable 
to numerous forms of dressing. They may be braised, or 
studded (piquScs) and braised, or fried tuith ham, or in 
butter (sautdes), and glaced, or grilled (au natural), or 
provided v^ith a variety of sauces and fancy names. 

Calf's Feet are prepared in most respects like calf's head, 
and in some like coio's heel ; but in the latter the skin is 
partly removed, while in the calf's feet it is left entire. 



CHAPTER XXXVIII. 

PREPARATIONS OF MUTTON. 

In Great Britain mutton is the most generally useful form 
of animal food, as well on account of its intrinsic qualities 
as of the adaptability of its parts to the smallest and largest 
wants. In Scotland, where barley, thistles, and sheep 
thrive equally well, mutton enjoys various forms of popular 
preparation, which lose much by transference to other 
climates. The preparation of the head of the sheep for 
cooking there begins with singeing with a red-hot iron ; if 
this were practised in London, it would lead to the inter- 
ference of sanitary committees of vestries, perhaps of the 
Local Government Board itself ; however, singeing com- 
pleted, the horns, if any are present, are sawed off; the 
head is soaked in warm water and scraped. In England 
the head is mostly deprived of its skin, which is con- 
sequently not cooked. The head is next split, and the 
brain is removed; this can be made into forcemeat-balls, 
or be used otherwise, as will be described. Soak the head in 
water during the night to be able to bleach and clean it. 



458 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Put it into a stewpan with water, and boil it with some 
vegetables. 

To make Hlieejfs Head Soup, a magiric authoress directs 
the head to be boiled with five quarts of water and | lb. 
of pearl barley. But the sheep's head requires four hours 
of boihng, and if it be large over four and a half. It is 
laborious as well, and of the product the only part worth 
eating is the tongue. The price of a ready-boiled salted 
sheep's tongue is fourpence in London. The sheep's head, 
less the tongue, is sold for sixpence. Therefore the nutri- 
ment contained on a sheep's head altogether costs ten- 
pence, raw, or more than the price of J lb. of good rump- 
steak. Kitchiner endeavoured to improve the dish by 
directing that there was to be left with the head four 
inches of the craig, or neck, of the sheep ; he also added 
the singed and cleaned feet ; he abandoned the brain, as 
the head was to be rubbed over with it after it had been 
singed and scraped. All was then to be boiled in good heef- 
broth, or, faihng that, in water. We do not think that 
sheep's head is under any circumstances at all an 
economical dish, unless head, pluck, and trotters can be 
obtained at a nominal price or for nothing. Neither 
should we say so much about it were it not that in certain 
schools of cookery the pupils are introduced to their sub- 
ject by a preparation of sheep's head. This is erroneous 
in more than one respect, as all will acknowledge who read 
what we have said above on the subject of sheep's head 
soup. 

Sheejfs Head may be baked, roast, braised, in a j^/awi 
state or stuffed, and steived, but then the necessary 
additions make it at once more expensive. The most 
practical form is the Galimafre of Head and Pluck, a 
well-flavoured ragout ; the miuce of liver and heart gives 
it substantial foundation. 

Sheep's Heart may be stufted and braised, and is suitable. 



PREPARATIONS OF MUTTON 459 

c.f/., for treatment in a petroleum stove, and as a dish for 
a single person or two persons. S'/iccj^'s Brain may be 
stewed, but requires savoury and spicy additions. Sheep s 
Tongues have been favoured with many forms of prepara- 
tion ; as a preliminary to all these, they have to be soaked for 
a long time in cold water, and then parboiled and peeled; 
a short salting gives them tone and colour. They may then 
be braised, or broiled, or grilled in imper -envelopes, en 
papillote, or gratinated, or enclosed with sauce in caul 
envelopes ; they may be braised and flavoured with Parma 
cheese, with matelote sauce; when pichlcd and boiled and 
deposited in an aspic jelly, they are an excellent supper 
or picnic dish. 

We have seen in the chapter on ox-tripe that Vuillemot 
boiled the tripe over a dozen of sheep's trotters, but he did 
not describe any further use he may have made of them. 
These shaved sheep's feet are prepared in some tripe-shops, 
and particularly in the French butchers' shops (charctitiers) 
in Soho, London, but are not much used in the rest of 
London, if we may judge from the number of sheep's feet 
which we saw turned into the glue caldrons in the 
Bermondsey tan yards. Of recipes there are some with 
lohite sauce, en poulette, like the cow's heel of Vuillemot ; 
others recommend sauce Bobert, and others ravigote. 

Sheep's Kidneys are grilled, fried, or egged, crumbed and 
fried, or braised, and immersed in sauce. Sheep's Tails are 
a fancy dish, and most tasty when grilled; but, of course, 
the tails must be such as are suitable for treatment, 
namely, large and fat. They may also be glaced and 
garnished with chicory, or given in hotch-potch, or fried, or 
braised in a terrine or p>ie. 

The Leg of Mutton should have dark red meat and white 
fat; it should be plump, short, and show the muscles 
projecting. When the leg is 8 or 9 lb. in weight, and 
exceeds the requirements for the day of a small family, it 



46o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



may be divided, and each part cooked in a different 
manner : the rump end may be roasted, and the knuckle 
end boiled ; the thick end will also yield slices to he dressed 
as cutlets, or scollops, or to be stewed, or incorporated with 
a China Chilo, so that similarly to the division of a piece 
of sirloin, which we have described above, a leg will give 
three good and different hot dinners. The honing of a 
leg of mutton, as technically understood, consists of the 
removal of the thigh-bone, and no more. The tibia, or bone 
in the knuckle, is preserved, at least in part, inasmuch as 
the condyle or cartilaginous surface of the head, by means 
of which it was in union with the thigh-bone, is sawn off ; 
the opening thus made is the one through which the femur 
is removed, the flesh being pushed upwards, and the head 
of the thigh-bone cut out of the pan. Into the cavity thus 
made any stuffing may be put, and the joint may be 
roasted or braised. The cook must choose the leg of 
mutton according to the purpose for which it is wanted. 
If you desire to have a small leg, choose one of Welsh 
mutton, which may vary between 5 and 7 lb. in weight. 
Welsh mutton is perhaps less suitable for boiling. Of 
ordinary legs of mutton, choose a lean one for roasting, 
and a fat one for boiling. 

The success of cooking, particularly of roasting, depends 
much upon the observation of the rides regarding time 
required for cooking. The interior of a thick piece of meat, 
like the leg of mutton, can be reached by the cooking 
process only by continued heating during a certain time. 
If an underdone joint, completed outside, be placed for a 
period in an oven, even at a temperature at which roasting 
from without would not continue, the underdone inside will 
nevertheless become done by the gradual even distribution 
of the heat from the roasted outside inwards. This is well 
illustrated by the mode in which some Noriuegians boil their 
mutton and other meat. They heat the joint just to ebulU- 



BOILED AND ROAST LEG OF MUTTON 461 



tion of the water, with any vegetable additions chosen, 
skim the broth and close the vessel, take it off the fire and 
enclose it in a box lined with thick felt, so that air and 
heat can get in and out only through the felt. Thus they 
let it stand for some hours, up to six, and on opening 
the case after that time they find the meat not only hot, 
but quite done, and ready for the table. From this experi- 
ence one can see how much value is lost in certain parts of 
culinary practice by hurrying, when mere conservancy and 
time would effect the business. 

The Leg of Mutton to be boiled should be put on the 
fire in cold water, together with the vegetables, if any, 
and heated to ebullition ; it should then be skimmed, and 
continue to be simmered for from two and a half to three 
hours, until the meat, while still juicy, be no longer red in 
its interior. The knuckle should be so well boiled that its 
tendinous parts are on the point of dissolving, and quite 
gelatinous. The broth in which the mutton was boiled 
will help to make a good soup, particularly if vegetables 
were boiled in it, and some Proust's extract of mutton were 
added before the boiling began. This addition of extract is 
particularly to be recommended when the joint is divided, 
as flavoured broth will impart to the meat at least as much 
flavour as it will dissolve of the extractive by boiling. 

Boast Leg of Mutton should be done, as the cooks of 
former generations expressed it, with the gravy in it, but 
not underdone; that is to say, the interior of the meat 
should reach a temperature at which the red juice is coagu- 
lated, but the white gravy is not expelled by contraction of 
the meat. Experiment with the thermometer shows this 
temperature to be 194° Fahr., being 18° below the boihng- 
point of water. The meat should be buttered with a brush 
and dredged over with flour; some defer this external 
apphcation to a later stage. The art of roasting a leg of 
mutton in such a manner that the outside shall be brown, 



462 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



fragile, and eatable, the knuckle gelatinous and tender, the 
inner meat juicy and short, and the brown rump end 
vigorous and unscathed, must not be considered small. 
The aponeurotic outside in particular is mostly left as a 
tough membrane, which has to be cut off the served slices. 
If this has not been remedied during the roasting by 
dredging and basting, it can be iniproved by a thin dredging 
with flour just before removal from the fire, and the applica- 
tion of the salamander to the joint upon the carving dish, 
an operation w^hich is termed f rot Jihig. 

The philosophy of the other various forms in which a leg 
of mutton can be prepared is too voluminous to be treated 
here in detail, even without the aid of special recipes ; it 
may be larded, braised, boned, stuffed, and accompanied 
with various sauces and vegetable preparations. The Chine 
or Saddle of Mutton, the Haunch, and the Loin, the 
Shoulder, the Neck, are all amenable to the same treatment. 
Several of these joints may be so assimilated to venison 
that, given prime eight-toothed wether nmtton, it may be 
so prepared by hanging, spicing, roasting, and the addition 
of the accompaniments necessary for the table, that a 
rational person may eat it with as much satisfaction as the 
best fallow deer. We ourselves have never found venison 
to be as good as the best mutton to be had daily, but we do 
not for that depreciate the taste or enthusiasm of those who 
from atavistic or other disposition delight in the proceeds 
of the exercise of the noble passion. 

Mutton Cotelettes, or Cutlets, should be prepared from the 
so-called neck of mutton, i.e., the anterior part of the back 
bearing ribs. Saw off the scrag end, that is to say, the 
bones of the spine, and as much of the ribs as may be neces- 
sary to shorten them down to three or four inches. In this 
process the thick part of the meat or fillet should not be 
injured. Some dexterous butchers and cooks divide the 
neck-bone into cutlets before beginning to trim. This is 



MUTTON CUTLETS 463 

convenient, and cooks who have no opportunities for boning 
and sawing, do well to obtain their cutlets thus split, and 
trim them in detail. The amount of trimmed cutlets 
obtained from a given weight of rough joint is little more 
than half the original weight ; for the removal of the bones, 
all but the small pieces of rib, of the fat, of the fibrous flaps, 
in which layers of meat and fat alternate, and of the yellow 
elastic tissue, or * cat's meat,' which lies close to the spine, 
and is not eatable for man {licjamentum nuchce), makes such 
havoc of the purchased piece, that whoever sees the process 
for the first time thinks it a very wasteful or very expensive 
one. Hence persons with an economical turn of mind en- 
deavour to leave the cutlets larger by not removing fat 
entirely, and by leaving the flaps on. But this is mostly 
vain, as these parts will then be trimmed off on the plate 
and left on it. Whoever thinks thoroughly trimmed cutlets 
extravagant should avoid cutlets in any form, and use chops. 
Not to trim cutlets down to the fillet is to spoil them. 

Mutton cutlets are liable to a great number of modes of 
preparation, but two are universal — grilled au naturel, and 
fried in egg and crumb ; when fried in butter^ the Frencli 
term them sautees, or d la minnte. The names given by 
French and English authors to different more complicated 
preparations are not comparable, as different preparations 
are described by the same name. With relation, e.g., to 
cutlets called a la Maintenon, Gouffe observes that French 
cooks had generally very different notions as to the manner 
in which they should be prepared ; he had seen some cooks 
wrapping them up in caul, others garnishing them with cocks' 
combs and truffles, others serving them with a soubise, and 
others again with a financiere sauce. ' As m.any kitchens,' 
he exclaims, ' as many different methods !' He adds that 
such divergences were frequent as to other dishes, and 
proceeds to attempt to remedy those concerning these 
cutlets by a new recipe, which mJght be headed : Mutton 



464 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

cutlets grilled, with d'Uxelles mince and d'Uxelles sauce. 
After having used it for his description of his form of cutlets 
a la Maintenoi, the same author declares that the name of 
d'Uxelles was ambitious, and at the same time little intelli- 
gible ; he therefore proposes to substitute for it a rational 
definition of the preparation, namely, 'fine herbs for 
garnishes and sauces,' meaning mushrooms, parsley, shallots, 
pepper and salt, all fried in butter. All this confusion of 
names is a modern product, and arises from the disregard 
of modern writers for the well-established names of typical 
dishes, and their want of acquaintance with the historical 
magiric literature of their country. 

Cutlets, whether of veal, pork, or mutton, grilled au 
naturel, or egged and crumbed, over a charcoal fire, were 
formerly called carbonades ; but during the last thirty years 
the word has been much supplanted by cutlet, or cotelette, 
and is heard rarely except in ancient establishments and 
places removed from the crushing influence of the levelling 
Juggenath. Quite a new apphcation of the word carhonade 
was made by some authors, who under this term gave 
recipes for the preparation of boned loins by genuine brais- 
ing. This involves a twofold mistake : firstly, a piece of 
meat to be grilled must be in the shape of relatively thin 
slices, and therefore a joint in its integrity cannot be called 
grilled or carbonated ; secondly, as these joints are directed 
to be braised, they are not carbonades, and the title of 
braised carbonades is at least an iteration or tautology. 
Gouffe seems to restrict the name carhonade to braised 
fillets of mutton, or boned chine, of which he specializes five 
variations, differing by vegetable garnishes only. 

Mutton Choirs are cut either from the so-called neck, i.e., 
the anterior part of the back, or, and this more frequently, 
from the posterior part of the back and the loin. Flatten 
them with the bat, and broil them over or before a clear 
fire ; spice them after they are done, and place them on a 



MUTTON CHOPS, KEBOBS, AND COLLOPS 465 

hot dish. Make it a rule never to put gravy either to beef- 
steaks or mutton chops ; it removes the outer coating of 
condensed gravy, which is the most savoury part, and even 
though it remain in any added gravy, is so diluted by it as 
to lose its most pleasing effect. When a fire sufficiently 
clear for grilling is not at hand, chops have to be fried in 
butter in a pan. Care should be taken that the butter be 
quite hot, so as to make the meat close the pores on its sur- 
face and take colour quickly. Mutton chops should be sent 
to table as hot as possible, be covered over, and not allov^ed 
to stand or wait ; they should be eaten with a small quantity 
of concentrated brown gravy or a savoury made sauce. 

Mutton chops produce an excellent ragout w^hen dressed 
as a so-called haricot. This word haricot in connection with 
mutton is surmised by some to be a contraction of * Haut 
ragout '; if so, it need not be derived from the white haricot 
beans, which certainly in the present time form no part of 
the dish. 

Boimclish slices of mutton, cut in imitation of the shape of 
a scollop, or escallope, the mollusc which owns the shell 
known by this name also, bear the abbreviated appellation 
of (Scotch) collops, German Clops. It would be better to 
term slices of mutton, be they nummulite or cubical (dice- 
like), which are to be roasted or fried by themselves, kcbobs, 
the Oriental or Turkish name, well understood throughout 
the Levant, and parts of India, where they are called 
kMibabs, and Africa. The kebobs or collojJS maybe cut from 
leg or loin, or any filleted thicker muscle, across the grain, 
dusted with flour, fried in butter, again dusted with flour, 
and placed in a sauce ; or they may be ranged on skewers, 
dredged with flour, and grilled or fried. This is the 
quickest mode of cooking mutton with a minimum of fire. 
When such kebobs are dusted over with a little curry-powder, 
and eaten with some well-buttered rice, they form a very 
relishing dish.

466 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

A Dunelm of Mutton , or Boyal Haggis y is a mince in 
pudding form, consisting of minced leg of mutton, suet, 
breadcrumb, eggs, anchovies, spices, mushrooms, and red 
wine. We think the wine objectionable. The mince is 
enclosed in a caul, and baked in a sautapan in a quick oven. 
Haggis, or Scotch Haggis, is a mince (hachis) in pudding 
form also, and is termed by the poet Burns * great chief- 
tain o' the pudding race.' Some have not improperly 
classed it amongst the sausages, of which its nearest 
analogues are German liver sausage and brawn, called 
Schtvarte - Magcn. Haggis may be made of mutton or 
lamb ; that is to say, their draught or pluck, comprising the 
liver, heart, sweetbread, and, according to some, the midriff, 
middle rib, i.e., between ribs or diaphragm. These par, 
boiled minced and grated materials, mixed with fat, bread, or 
flour, properly spiced, are enclosed in the soaked, cleansed, 
and scraped fourth stomach of the animal, not too tightly, 
so as to admit of some expansion, and boiled for three 
hours. Haggis is a dish of which it is said that South 
Britons, going North, eat once to satisfy curiosity, but never 
again. This small repute has yet been diminished by a 
humorist who had heard that a certain (badly made) haggis, 
on being cut into at table, had squirted some of its contents 
over part of the company ; in this case air had evidently 
been included, and not been allowed to escape through the 
pricks prescribed to be inflicted upon the bag. 



CHAPTER XXXIX. 

PREPARATIONS OF LAMB. 

KiTCHiNER gives a humorous warning to beware of accept- 
ing an invitation to dinner on Easter Sunday to eat Easter 
grass lamh, and encountering instead young, tough, stringy 



PREPARATIONS OF LAMB 467 



mutton, which had better be called hay mutton. House 
lamb might be iu season from Christmas to Lady Day ; 
grass lamb from Easter to Michaelmas ; but sham lamb was 
independent of the season. For a quarter of porkling was 
sometimes skinned, cut and dressed lamb fashion, and thus 
' lambified ' was sent as a substitute for it. The leg and 
loin of lamb, when little, should be roasted together, the 
former being lean, the latter fat, and the gravy better 
preserved. In the case of roast lamb, to the usual accom- 
paniments of roast meat green mint sauce is commonly 
added ; and some cooks, about five minutes before the lamb 
is done, sprinkle it with a little finely-minced parsley. 
Lamb, like all other young meat, ought to be thoroughly 
done ; therefore, do not take either lamb or veal from the 
spit or jack till you see it drop white gravy. This rule, 
which is applicable to pork of ail ages, is of great import- 
ance for the preservation of health. 

As regards the roasting of lamb the rules regarding mutton 
obtain. We will therefore here merely mention the average 
time which is required for each joint. A hind-quarter of 
lamb of about 8 lb. will take from an hour and a quarter to 
two hours ; it requires basting and frothing. A fore- quarter 
of 10 lb. will require about two hours. In the carving of 
this joint the shoulder is generally excised entire, and its 
cavity treated with butter and orange- juice. A leg of lamb 
may weigh about 5 lb., and take about an hour or an hour 
and a half in roasting. A shoulder, which is a small joint, 
will take an hour. Bibs require to be nicely jointed ; the 
ribs must be cut or fractured, so that they can be easily 
severed from the brisket after it is roasted; if this be 
omitted, the slices of ribs are inconveniently long on the 
plates of the diners. Loin takes an hour and a quarter ; 
neck an hour ; breast three-quarters of an hour. 

Lamb is rarely boiled ; a leg of about 5 lb. should simmer 
very gently for about two hours. So-called grilled lamb is 



468 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

boiled first and grilled afterwards. The slwulders and 
breast are considered most suitable for it. Having been 
boiled, the joint is scored in chequers, about an inch square, 
rubbed with yolk of egg, peppered and salted, crumbed, and 
strewed with parsley, and is then carbonadoed, i.e., grilled 
or broiled over a clear fire or in a sharp oven. 

The Lamb Steio, or Lamb Stove, Galimafr4e, in part to be 
made with the head and lights, is really a soux) of the old 
type, the liquid part of which has to be eaten with a spoon, 
while the solid one requires knife and fork. 

A Shoulder of Lamb boned, stuffed, larded, and braised, 
in French is termed a ballotine. Neck and Breast may be 
filleted and fried as cutlets. Lavib Cutlets are prepared like 
mutton cutlets in many forms and variations. Ejngrams of 
Breast of Lamb with Tendrons are a French dish of distinc- 
tion ; it is a compound preparation produced from the breast 
of lamb, consisting of cutlets of the usual form with bone, 
and of cutlet- shaijcd slices cut out of the boned side of the 
breast ; into the pointed end of each slice a splinter of 
rib is inserted, so that the arrangement resembles the fillet 
cutlets. With these the white rib cartilages, or tendrons, are 
to be united. The dish receives a white savoury sauce, and 
is used as a releve. 

Lamb's Ears and Lamb's Head and Feet are treated even 
by serious authors such as Beauvilliers, but the products 
are never proportioned to the trouble involved in their pre- 
paration.

preparations of pork, the flesh of the 
encyclop.5:dic animal. 

It has been truly said that without pork there would have 
been no bacon, and without bacon no accompHshed cookery ; 



PREPARATIONS OF PORK 469 



there would be neither ham, nor sausages, nor black 
puddings ; there would have been no 'jyetit saU for the 
Emperor Claudius, and perhaps neither he nor his Senate 
would have been at all happy. Without the living pig there 
would be fewer truffles available, for they are discovered in 
the earth mainly by the organ of smell of that sagacious 
animal. All nations of antiquity, and those succeeding 
them down to our own time, the Semitic races, the 
Egyptians, and the Gaelic inhabitants of the Western 
Islands of Scotland alone excepted, reared pigs in large 
numbers. Great is the number of places which enjoy a 
worldwide reputation for their special preparations of pork. 
Who has not heard of Yorkshire ham, of Cumberland 
bacon ; of the hams of Westphalia, Mayence, Bayonne, 
Granada, Estremadura ; of Savoy, or Saveloy (cervelat), 
sausages ; of Frankfort Knackwurst ; of Bath chaps and 
cold cream ? 

By the fact of the pig eating refuse whwi it is neglected 
by its owner, and by the frequent exercise of its prudent 
instinct of wallowing in mud and letting it dry upon its 
skin, a process by which it rids itself of the powerful skin 
parasites by which in unclean habitations it becomes at 
times afflicted, it has acquired the unjust reputation of being 
a dirty, or even a filthy, animal. But all these imputations 
are unfounded. We kept pigs as clean as possible, and the 
animals responded by perfect personal cleanliness, and by 
preserving the decorum of their stalls ; they were washed 
periodically with soap and warm water, and stood still and 
grunted while they were thus being cleaned. They refused 
to eat inferior or defiled food if they had the choice of eating 
clean materials. 

It has been often said that the construction of the inner 
organs of the pig is so like that of man, that by contemplating 
the dissected pig one could learn the anatomy of man. Cuvier 
corrected this popular prejudice when he wrote : ' The 



470 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

stomach of man and that of the pig have no great resem- 
blance to each other. In man this viscus has the shape of 
a bagpipe, in the pig it is globular ; in man the liver is 
divided in three lobes, in the pig it is long and flat ; in man 
the intestinal canal is seven to eight times as long as the 
body, in the pig it is from fifteen to eighteen times the 
length of the body. The caul (cawl, hell, epij^loon, net, in 
French commonly called toilette or crSjnne) is larger and 
more charged with fat, and what is most consoling for 
delicate souls who want to have nothing in common with 
the nature of the pigs is this, that its heart differs notably 
from that of man. I may add for the learned and aesthetical 
that the volume of the pig's brain is also much smaller than 
that of man, which proves that its intellectual faculties are 
much smaller than those of our Academicians.' 

The pig is, like the rabbit, one of the most prolific animals. 
The French Marshal Vauban wrote a treatise on pigs, 
humorously entitled ' Ma Cochonnerie,' in which he calcu- 
lated the possible posterity of a sow to be, after twelve 
years, more than 6,000,000 of porkers. 

Tbe various parts of the pig are more frequently used in 
the kitchen than those of other animals, as is proved by the 
perusal of any cookery-book, and as can be seen in many 
kitchens where cookery is carried on by mere tradition, 
without any written or printed record. 

Bacon and ham are most frequently used, the other parts 
of pork are less sought after ; however, boar's head is a dis- 
tinguished dish when prepared by a cook who understands 
that its value consists in its appreciation as an atavistic 
tradition. The feet are dressed after the fashion of Ste. 
Menehould, or stuffed with truffles ; the ears are served en 
menu de roi ; and the breast is used in many ragouts. No 
part need be thrown away. Of its blood black pudding 
is made ; of its intestines are made chitterlings (Fr. 
andouilles, Lat. edulia. Germ. Kaldannen), of the fragments 



PREPARATIONS OF PORK 471 

of its meat sausages, and of its almost denuded bones grilled 
and boiled ^;e^i^ sales (Germ. Solper-Knochen) are made. 
Even pigs' tails have been honoured with being the objects 
of ambitious ragouts and feeble recipes, and have shared, 
with ears, the braises, garnishes, and other favours of 
culinary grotesqueness. 

As Boar's Head is a traditional dish, and as in common 
life real wild boar's head is of rare occurrence, the domestic 
bacon hog must yield the materials which are to be trans- 
formed into the simile of his ancestors of courageous 
memory. It is to be boned, stuffed, braised, covered with 
aspic jelly, and eaten cold. 

Roast Neck and Loin of Pork are treated with some sage 
and onion, and well done, and to be accompanied with 
apple sauce. The Griskin of Pork is also mostly roasted, 
sometimes in the larded state. Griskin is in practice 
defined as that part of the pig which is cut from the 
side of the bacon hog, namely, the lean from the neck 
and loin ; it may weigh from 7 to 8 lb., and take from an 
hour and a half to two hours roasting. A so-called Bacon 
Sparerib, or Bald Sparerih, is so called because almost all 
the meat is pared off; when yet covered to some extent it 
may weigh up to 9 lb., but when very bald care must be 
taken not to let it get burnt before it is warmed through. 
Chops or Cutlets of pork may be plain, grilled, or fried, or 
glaced and crumbed and fried, boiled * with the gravy in 
them,' and served with sauce Bobert, or curried and dished 
li rindienne. The Leg of Pork is also frequently roasted. 
When it is skinned and roasted, it is called mock goose. 
A synonym might be goosified pork, an expression formed 
after the precedent of Priscilla Haslehurst's ' Housekeeper's 
Instructor,' which gives a recipe ' to goosify a shoulder of 
lamb.' Leg of pork is much improved by pickling and boil- 
ing. Some cooks, when the pork is about to be served, 
score the skin in diamonds, and take out every other 



472 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

square. Kitchiner thinks that this will let out juice and 
deteriorate the remainder, but a fat leg will not suffer by 
the ornamentation. Pickled Pork in small pieces (the j;e^i^ 
saU of the French, Solj^ei' of the Germans) is a favourite 
dish with an ancient history. The Roman Emperor 
Claudius entered the Senate one day and called out : ' Con- 
script fathers, is it possible to live without pork pickled in 
slices?' And the venerable fathers rephed at once : ' Oh, sir, 
it is better to die than to have to live without salt pork !' 

Hain admits of many different excellent modes of pre- 
paration, which we cannot discuss in detail. For boiling it 
requires trimming and soaking, on which subject the 
observations of Kitchiner are carefully to be noted. It 
may be braised in various ways, baked if young and not too 
dry, roasted in a cover of venison paste, and may be sugar- 
cured after the Spanish fashion. 

Pig's Feet, or Trotters, are boiled fresh in salt water, and 
consumed largely by the lower classes. Prepared a la 
Ste. MenShould, i.e., egged, crumbed, and fried, they were a 
favourite entree dish in France a century ago. 

Black Pudding, in French boudin ordinaire, is a sausage 
made of pig's blood, pork fat cut in small dice, grits, or 
rice, and spices and salt. The mixture is filled into pre- 
pared guts, and boiled. It may be eaten cold, but many 
prefer it broiled in slices. 

Roast Sucking-Pig was formerly a much more popular 
dish than it is now ; thus, the citizens of London consumed 
in the year 1725 no less than 52,000 of these animals. It 
may be stuffed and baked at the baker's, or it may be boned 
and made into a galantine, with aspic, and served as an 
entremets. The variations are numerous and very elegant ; 
in many parts of the South sucking-pig is frequently pre- 
pared for unexpected guests. The sucking-pig's feet are 
called imtty toes, and worked into a ragout with the pluck 
and blood of the animal. 



PREPARATIONS OF WILD BOAR 473 

The Wild Boar cannot be cleared of its bristles by scalding 
and scraping, but its surface has to be singed with red-hot 
irons. The skin, therefore, always contains the roots of the 
bristles, and has to be soaked and boiled greatly to become 
eatable. The preservation of the skin is essential only in 
the case of the hoar's head ; from all other parts it may be 
removed, like any other animal's skin. 

The flesh of the Wild Boars Saddle or Loins is very solid 
and tendinous, and requires, like the head, a double process 
of cooking, namely, braising in the first place, and after- 
wards painting, crumbing, baking, and basting with a 
savoury mirepoix. Some red deer in Germany receive a 
similar treatment. Wild boar may be roasted, or made 
into a ragoiU, or collared, i.e., rolled and dressed in aspic. 
But for all these preparations the boar must not be less 
than a year, and not more than three years old ; a loin of 
an animal of about two years, well braised in a brown 
sauce, is an admirable delicacy. 



CHAPTEE XLI. 

PREPARATIONS OF VENISON FROM FALLOW DEER, 
RED DEER, AND ROE DEER. 

Venison requires the greatest attention in the kitchen, and 
the observance of special rules as to ' mortification ' or 
hanging. Venison from Fallow Deer was once reckoned 
the choicest meat in use, yet was more often spoiled than 
any other. The Haunch is the finest joint. Before being 
hung it requires to have certain lymphatic glands re- 
moved, which are liable to become starting-points of un- 
pleasant changes. The Neck is the next best joint, and 
requires no special treatment. The Shoulder and Breast 



474 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

are generally used for pasties, after having been two or 
three days in the larder. Buck venison is in greatest per- 
fection from midsummer to Michaelmas, and doe from 
November to January. A Buck Haunch generally weighs 
from 20 to 25 lb., and, when covered with oiled paper and 
paste, will require four and a half hours' roasting, in cold 
weather more. When it is done the envelopes are removed, 
and the outside is dredged over and frothed. It is sent to 
table with a strong brown gravy and red currant jelly, or 
a sauce made from it. Of other -preparations we have 
Venison Steaks, plain-broiled ; Venison Fry, of which liver 
and sweetbread are principal ingredients ; Haunch of 
Venison, braised, after having been larded ; ScoUojys or 
Kehohs, and Civet, Pasty, etc. The joints of Bed Deer 
undergo analogous preparations. Fawn of Falloiv Deer is 
treated like lamb, and roasted in quarters, or made into 
hash and civet. As a dish for show it used also to be 
roasted entire. The Boe Deer is the most delicately 
flavoured of the three varieties of venison from deer, and, 
like Welsh mutton, is very suitable for filleting. It is 
always finely larded, marinaded, braised, and given in a 
savoury espagnole sauce. It is also quickly cooked, a loin 
or saddle requiring three-quarters of an hour's baking in 
the oven, or an hour's braising, to become done. It should 
not be cooked too long, as prolonged heating makes the 
meat dry. Cutlets, scolloi^s, haricots, civets, roasts, are all 
prepared like those of fallow deer. Wiirtemberg is the 
country where roe deer is yet frequent ; in former times 
this mountainous country abounded also in red deer ; the 
royal coat of arms bears a pair of stag's antlers. 



HISTORY OF RABBITS 



475 



CHAPTEE XLII. 

PREPARATIONS OF RABBIT. 

Not many generations have passed since the time when 
rabbits were considered vermin, and their chase beneath the 
dignity of a sportsman ; but in our time they have been 
made game, and thus contributed greatly to the emascula- 
tion of sport. Babbits are natives of Africa, and have 
entered Europe through Spain. There are provinces in 
Germany which have been kept clear of them, but in most 
parts of the Continent they have domiciled for good, and 
are with difficulty restrained from injurious multiplication. 
At the beginning of our era they were so destructive in 
Spain, that at Tarragona more than twenty-five houses 
tumbled down, having been undermined by these animals. 
Rabbits were so numerous in Spain that Catullus called 
that country Cuniculosa Celtiberia, and medals struck in 
the reign of Hadrian represent the Peninsula under the 
form of a beautiful woman, clothed in a robe and mantle, 
with a rabbit at her feet. The very name Hisimma is 
derived from this animal ; it was called Saphan in Hebrew, 
of which the Phoenicians made Spania, and the Latins 
Hispania. Basilazzo, one of the Liparian isles north of 
Sicily, was once reduced to famine by rabbits ; a similar 
fate befell the Balearic Isles. France swarmed with them, 
particularly in the south ; and it is related by Beaujeu 
that a Proven9al gentleman went out in 1551 with several 
of his vassals and three dogs, and bagged six hundred 
rabbits in one day. He also relates that on the island 
near Aries they were so numerous that if a sportsman did 
not kill a hundred of them in a day he was dissatisfied. 
In our day the rabbit-pest in Australia and New Zealand is 



476 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

sufficiently notorious to illustrate the dangerous character 
of this animal. But whatever rnay be the cost to agricul- 
ture of every wild rabbit, the species furnishes a vast 
araount of food of varying quality, and in such a subdivided 
state that it is accessible to the small purse. It is calcu- 
lated in the statistics of hat-makers, who use the skins, or, 
rather, their hair, for the production of felt, that about 
twenty millions of rabbits are killed annually in Europe. 
Their flesh is best for eating during the winter-time ; they 
should not be too young or too old. The young rabbit is 
distinguished from the old one by having on its forefeet, 
below the joint, underneath the skin, a projection of the size 
of a lentil, which the old rabbit no longer possesses. The 
wild or warren rabbit is recognised by the red colour of 
the hair of its feet, and of the part under its tail. This 
colour is produced in tame rabbits by singeing, and the 
fraud can be discovered by the burnt smell of the parts. 
The flesh of the rabbit is mostly lean, and very digestible. 

Boast Babbit is not in favour in this country, and English 
culinary works take no notice of it. It is, however, a ready 
method of preparing a dish quickly, as a rabbit can be 
roasted in from thirty to forty minutes. To prevent the 
rabbit from getting dry, cover it with yolk and crumb, and 
baste it with butter. 

Gibelotte (old style) means a dish of Stewed Babbit, and 
nothing else ; the fricassee is better if half an eel be fried 
with it. ScollojJS or Kebobs of Babbit may be fried or 
stewed, and are yet quicker prepared than the whole rabbit. 
The gibelotte may be garnished with green peas. Fillets of 
rabbits may be placed in ragouts, and garnished with 
quenelles; or placed in a casserole with a cuUis. The 
Portuguese braise the rabbit before boning it, and place 
the meat in a sauce, mostly espagnole, to form fricassee. 
Fillets of Babbit may be sauced, crumbed, and broiled. 

The word Bresolles is used in two senses — as a substan- 



GIBELOTTE AND BRESOLLES OF RABBIT 477 

tive, to signalize a dish, and to describe the form of the 
ingredients of the dish. Magiric authors of the last century 
placed bresolles with scallops, as they termed them casca- 
lo]}es^ and implied thereby slices of meat of the size of a 
penny, which might be cut from veal, mutton, lamb, or 
rabbit ; they were always fried in oil, and then transformed 
into a ragout, to be served as entree or as hors d'oeuvre. 
Some modern French anecdote-hunters derive the name of 
the dish from that of a French marquis who served during 
the Seven Years' War, in the course of which his valet is 
said to have invented the dish, and termed it, after his 
master, Bresolles. But bresolles were in use and well 
known long before that date, as is shown by the fact that, to- 
gether with cascalopes, they occupy the whole of chapter iii. 
of vol. iii. of La Chapelle's * Cuisinier Moderne.' We have 
met in books of the present time with paragraphs on 
Lapins en Brezolc, and with the deviating spelling a very 
different dish, which we believe more likely to have been 
invented by the valet than the other one. For the rabbit's 
flesh, worked into a farce, with the usual additions, was to 
be tied up in the rabbit-skin, and braised, but you were not 
told how to deal with the hair of the skin. 

Bresolles of Fillets ivith Croquettes of Legs of Babbit are a 
very accomplished dish, to be served wdth garnishes and 
allemande sauce. 

Babbit cooked in its Skin is a recipe of Vuillemot's, from 
the time when he was proprietor of the Tete Noire at 
St. Cloud, and had a contract for the sale of rabbits from 
large hunting-fields. It was then that he made that dish 
of a hundred rabbits' tongues, which was so much admired. 
The rabbit to be cooked in its skin should be a wild one, 
and have been captured with a snare. It should be gutted 
and stuffed through a small opening. Some oil is then to 
be introduced between skin and flesh, and distributed by 
hanging up the carcase and changing its position from head 



478 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

up to head down, and vice versa, every hour. It is then to 
be roasted before the fire, the oil acting as only basting. 
The hair, which becomes loose, is to be brushed off with 
some couch grass ; when it is done, pull off the entire skin 
and keep the hair off the roast by blowing. Dish with a 
sauce. There seems no poetry about the dish, or skill in 
the overcoming of the self-created difficulties. Boiled Babbit 
can be done in half an hour, and be accompanied with a 
liver and lemon sauce. 

Many other modes of preparation of rabbit are very 
interesting, and good to eat : Polpettes of Babbit {a 
ritalienne), flavoured with Parma cheese ; Gratinated 
Babbit, baked over slices of ham, and covered with farce ; 
Timbale of Babbit, a complicated ragout ; Larded Babbit 
braised ivith Turnips ; Babbit in Pajnllote, grilled ; Mari- 
naded and Fried Babbit, immersed in a batter ; Legs of 
Babbits, stuffed — the cavities of the boned legs are filled 
with farce, and the dish is termed Lapereaux en Bottines, 
of two variations : one is larded, the other one not; Babbit 
in Mayonnaise, hot or cold, is a useful dish. La Chapelle 
in 1740 gave more than twenty explicit recipes for dishes 
produced from rabbit — amongst them, nineteen entrees, 
which fill the whole of chapter ix. of his third volume. The 
thin-ribbed thoracic and the flabby abdominal flanks of the 
rabbit are always of bad taste, and should be removed in 
the trimming of every preparation, and never used. For 
the same reason it is not advisable to fill a rabbit with 
ventral stufiing. Great care is to be taken to use. only a 
perfectly sound liver, free from nodules and discoloured 
spots. 



PREPARATIONS OF HARE 479 



CHAPTER XLIII. 

PREPARATEONS OF HARE. 

The Jews were ordered by the Levites not to eat the hare. 
This was made use of for some pleasantry by Phitarch, who 
repeated a satirical observation of the grammarian Apion, 
to the effect that the Jews avoided eating the hare on 
account of the similarity of its ears to those of the ass, 
which latter they adored. The hare was not eaten by the 
ancient Britons, as reported by Cassar. Though it abounded 
in the Orient, as we know from Xenophon, and in Greece 
and all the islands of its seas, Hippocrates had forbidden 
its use, alleging that it thickened the blood and caused 
cruel wakefulness. Galen controverted this opinion. At 
all events, both Greeks and Romans ate hare roast and in 
pies, and some Roman ladies were said to have eaten it 
daily for a long period as a cure for plainness of features. 

The preparations of hare resemble in many respects 
those of rabbit. Hare soup we have sufficiently discussed 
above ; it is, according to some, the only form in which it 
is desirable to eat any part of the hare. The leveret, or 
young hare, has, like the laijereau, or young rabbit, a small 
knob- under the first joint of the fore-foot, which disappears 
as it grows older. A hare can also be judged of by the 
toughness of its ears. If they are easily torn, it will 
probably be tender ; if they resist much, the flesh will be 
tough. 

Boast Hare, as dressed in England, is a form difficult to 
manage. The animal is skewered in a crouching position, 
with its head and ears on. Though enveloped in bacon 
and oiled paper, it is mostly dry, and but an indifferent 
^ second-course roast.' A form in which the fiesh can be 



48o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

kept more juicy is the so-called Baron of Hare, roasted or 
baked in the oven. Having cased the hare (casing is a 
technical term for skinning and drawing, or paunching), cut 
off the anterior part with the shoulders, the ribs, and place 
all these parts with the liver, head, and kidneys, to make a 
brown ragout with ; split the pelvic bones in the middle 
line ; cut away the tendinous outer skin, lard the hare, and 
place it in an aromatic marinade of vinegar and water for 
at least twenty-four hours. Braise it with all additions ; 
reduce the braise to a proper adhesive consistency. A 
young hare will be done in little more than half an hour, 
an older one in less than an hour. When the hare is 
certainly young, the marinade may be omitted. Fillets of 
Hare may be similarly treated, or with Puree of Hare, and 
be served with any suitable sauce — tomato, poivrade, 
cinnamon, and cherry sauce; the latter is termed d VAlle- 
mande. Fillets of Hare can also be dressed as cutlets, au 
naturel, or in various complicated forms. 

Civet of Hare is believed to derive its name from the fact 
that the dish was originally flavoured with civet {cive, civette, 
in French, is the name of Allium schosiiojprasum ; English, 
chives), and that later, the special green condiment being 
omitted or replaced by leeks and onions, a preparation 
strongly and finely flavoured by general spices retained the 
name. The hare is cut into small joints ; streaky bacon or 
ham is fried in a roux, and after the removal of the fry the 
pieces of hare are also fried in the same roux. Both fries 
having been united, receive an addition of mushrooms, 
onions studded with cloves, nutmeg, a carrot, a garnished 
faggot of parsley, pepper and salt, some port wine, and a 
suitable volume of standard broth. Heat to ebullition, with 
gentle stirring ; then add any suitable parts of the hare — 
such as liver and lights — and reduce to proper consistency 
of the sauce. The dish admits of several garnishes, and is 
very tasty and tender. Kebobs or Scollops of Hare may be 



PREPARATIONS OF HARE 481 

flavoured with any of the leading sauces. Jugged Hare 
derives its adjective from the jug into which it is placed for 
being cooked, as bottled beer does from the bottle in which 
it is revivified by a second fermentation. The hare is cut 
into pieces as for civet, and placed into the jugging-'pot 
(mark the tautology), or into a stone jar, just sufficiently 
large to hold it well together with some veal and ham as 
for braising. Now all the ingredients for a ragout are 
added, and the jug or jar is closed with a bladder tied over 
its aperture, and put in a saucepan containing hay and 
warm water. In this water-bath the jug is heated for at 
least three hours, the water being kept boiling all the time. 
Braising in a stewpan in the oven is both easier and quicker; 
the hare may be boned, have its hollows filled with farce, 
be larded, and braised a Vancienne. Hare Cake is a cold 
arrangement of hare, mutton, and ham bedded in aspic. 

Various preparations of hare have special features. Thus, 
Hare a la Bourgeoise is a ragoiU, bound with the blood of 
the hare. In the case of Levrauts au Sang, the blood of 
five pigeons is to be added to that of each leveret; the blood 
is here employed as a liaison. 

Various ragoMs, under the names of Terrines, Pdt^s, Pdt6 
en Fusde, can be produced by combining two or more of the 
processes above alluded to. 



CHAPTER XLIV. 

PREPARATIONS OF FOWLS. 

The covwion fowl is reported to come from India, but 
nowadays inhabits the whole globe, though in much varied 
forms. In Turkey it has a rich plumage; in China its 
feathers are often stunted to a kind of wool ; in Persia it 

31 



482 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

has no tail ; in Cochin China it cannot fly ; in India there 
is a common variety which has black flesh and black bones, 
but is still very good to eat. Fowls have been used as food 
in all historical ages."^ 

The French cooks distinguish four varieties of chickens + 
for use in the kitchen : 1. The common poulet, or chicken, 
which is generally used in fricassee, and of the flesh of 
which various descriptions of forcemeat are made. 2. The 
half-fat chicken (jjoulet demi-gras), used for marinading raw, 
and for curries and different entrees which do not require 
very large poulets. 3. The chicken d la reine, which serves 
for entrees and roasts. 4. The large fat chicken, or poulet, 
which is more commonly used for roasting than for any 
other purpose. The earliest poulets come to market in 
France, and, indeed, now in most of the large towns of 
Europe, towards the end of April ; they are easily recognised 
by the whiteness or yellow colour of their skin. When 
dead and plucked, they are commonly left covered with 
little sprouting feathers to show their youth ; their feet 
(toes) are more united than those of older birds, softer to 
the touch, and of a blue, slaty colour. Old hens and old 
cocks are, in the kitchen, only useful to give some extractive 
to bouillons or consommes ; capons come later in the year, 
when chickens and poulardes have become more rare. 

The most common form in which chicken is used in this 
country is roast plain. Before putting the dressed animal 
before the fire, put into its inside some butter, lemon-juice, 
and salt ; close it up, and wrap it in slices of bacon. It 
will take an hour or less to roast ; when it is done, take off

the bacon, and brown the outside. In case you serve the 
roast chicken on a bed of watercresses, it becomes, in 
French magiric language, a rot ; but when served with 
made sauce — tomato, Dutch, crayfish, or any other — it is 
called an entree. You may fill the chicken with truffles, or 
a well-seasoned farce, or with chestnuts. 

Chichens and Foivls boiled in w^ater or standard broth, 
with vegetables, are a favourite English dish ; they may 
be eaten with boiled or broiled ham and white butter 
sauce. A chicken may be boiled in about fifteen minutes. 
When it is intended to be served with a sauce, e.g., 
bechamel and tarragon, it should be wiped quite dry 
before the sauce is put over it. 

Fowls may be stewed, particularly with rice, and this 
dish should always be made with standard broth ; as the 
fowl takes longer than the rice to become done, it is pre- 
ferable to boil each by itself, and mix the products. The 
best boiled fowl we know of is one boned, stuffed with 
farce, and cooked in standard broth in a Papin's digester. 
From a comparison of the weight of boned fowl with that 
of its skeleton, and of its price to that of rumpsteak, we 
have learned that the price of the eatable part of fowl is 
about 2s. Id. per pound, or about one-third more than 
rumpsteak. 

Fricassee of Fowl is prepared with a typical white 
savoury sauce, which is best flavoured with mushrooms. 
The dish undergoes many variations, according to the 
special treatment of the sliced fowl, the garnishes, and 
the ragouts which it is made to accompany, and is then 
called a la St. Lambert ; braised and fried, a la Dau;pJiine ; 
tried in oil, braised and garnished with ravioli, a la Bomaine. 

Curried Foid (syn. l^ari de poulet d VIndienne) is a 
fricassee to which curry-powder has been added ; it is 
generally preferred with boiled rice ; it should be savoury, 
contain no excess of onions, and be not too hot. 



484 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

For Fried Chickens, the bodies should be partially boned, 
and steeped in a marinade, dipped in batter, crumbed and 
fried in batter. Cold chickens, which have been roasted or 
boiled or fricasseed may be similarly treated. In cookery- 
books a great number of similar preparations receive un- 
necessarily separate paragraphs, and thereby cause diffi- 
culties to persons vvho wish to make a choice amongst 
them. One bears the name of friteau, perhaps a culinary 
name, but not contained in dictionaries ; then there are 
chickens a la Toscane, which obtain their name from a 
garnish of macaroni dressed ivith cheese. When the fried 
chicken is again bereft of the garnish it becomes a la 
Viennoise, the dish popular throughout Upper Austria 
and Tyrol under the name of Back-Hdhnerl. 

Bissoles of Chicken are the fried form of mince of which 
the Dnnelm of Chicken, so ably described by Ignotus in 
* Culina Famulatrix Medicinse ' is the stewed form. In 
the absence of fresh mushrooms, it is to receive flavour 
from their powder or from catchup. 

Capilotade of Chicken is a kind of ragout made with 
remains of fowl or game, and some simple brown sauce ; 
we notice variations named a la Marengo, showing garlic 
and oil ; a la Provencale, the same and onions and 
tomatoes ; a la Lyonnaise, a la Diablc, d la Tartare, all 
named after the relative sauces. Lastly, the form a 
VAlgerienne seems to show that Algerian cookery (if, indeed, 
the recipe be African) is liberating itself from Mussulman 
restrictions, the fricassee being directed to be made with 
a 2^ound of raiv ham, cut in slices. When a mince of 
chicken is made hot in veloute sauce, and pointed with 
butter and lemon-juice, it is called hlanquette. 

Fricassee of Chicken may be bedded in aspic jelly, and 
served cold. 

Cold Boast Chicken may be moistened with mayonnaise ; 
an addition of aspic, and aspic in shreds in cups, and a 



PREPARATIONS OF CAPON 485 

garnish of hard-boiled hen's or plover's eggs, produce a 
very elegant dish. A Salad of Chicken is similarly prepared, 
but the chicken is minced, and receives additions of capers, 
anchovies, and gherkins in thin slices. 

The Preparations of Capon are in most respects parallel 
to those of fowls. The plain-hoiled capon is by French 
cooks called chapon au gros sel, because they put a pinch 
of crystallized rough salt on the stomach of the animal 
v^hen it is on the dish for being carved. This putting of 
rough salt upon plain-boiled meat of all kinds, particularly 
beef, was formerly very common, perhaps universal, in 
established kitchens ; as regards the boiled capon, it survives 
as an atavistic habit, and a sign to the eaters that the 
capon is plain-boiled, not stuffed, and to be eaten with 
concentrated broth of beef. A capon will take an hour to 
boil ; to ascertain its complete coction, pinch the wing be- 
tween two fingers. Capon stetved loith Bice and stuffed 
tvith Truffles, roasted, are favourite forms of preparation. 
Like fowl, it is also made into a galantine. 

Breasts or Fillets of Foiols are a subject regarding which 
many culinary writers become sentimental on behalf of 
their readers' pockets, for dishes made with fillets are ex- 
pensive, the fillets alone costing about four shillings a pound. 
They then append to their regrets consoling considerations, 
to the effect that the parts of the fowls not withdrawn for 
fillets could be used in the preparation of other dishes. 
This shows that a good cook will reach the limits of the 
patience of even the largest purse, and more particularly 
by means of the fillets of fowls. No doubt that with un- 
limited fillets a chef may produce charming entrees, from 
the simplest au supreme to the most complicated poularde 
en bigarure after the receipt of Vincent de la Chapelle. Of 
this the many existing formulae for supremes are evidence. 
But for the diner these dishes have the disadvantage that 
they spoil the liking of the palate for more vigorous food, 



486 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



and by a certain monotony compel the cook to vary them 
in that forced manner which ends in disguises of which the 
true sesthetical gastronomer is not hkely to approve. 

In the preparation of ilie, siq^reme, care must be taken to 
remove the tendinous or aponeurotic envelopes, particularly 
the one which separates the main from the minion fillet. 
The fillets are then fried white in butter, and after re- 
moval of the excess of butter, covered with supreme sauce, 
garnished with button mushrooms, and sent to table. The 
variations are many, and consist mostly in additions. 
When cuttings of red tongue are placed between the 
fillets, the dish may be termed d Vecarlate. The cook 
may separate the minion from the main fillet, and treat 
them a little differently, e.g., stud them with truffies, and 
then you have supxme of fillets of fowls au truffes. When 
the fillets are arranged round a ragout, they receive the 
title of this latter. This toying with small variations, 
leading only to the construction of new paragraphs and 
titles in cookery-books, becomes ultimately transcendental, 
when a few slices of steioed ciicumher, practically a rather 
tasteless and indifferent dish, must furnish the means for 
varying, under the surname of a la Bellevue, the beauty 
and quality of a preparation which Beauvilliers first 
described in his practical manner. 

While in the preparations just described the fillets are 
fried with the precaution to keep them white, in the case of 
the Breasts or Fillets of Fowls a VIndien7ie, both the fillets 
and the ham with which they are covered are fried until 
they have acquired a light brown colour. They are then 
covered with esjmgnole in which finely cut mango has been 
simmered. These brown fillets also admit of many varia- 
tions both as to sauce and central ragout. 

The Legs of Chickens and i^ow/s, which are left after the 
excision of the breasts for supremes, may be employed for 
the production of so-called galantines of legs of foiols^ also 



VARIOUS PREPARATIONS OF FOWLS 487 

termed en canetons, or en loetits oignons, or en ballon, all 
these names being derived from their shape, or, like the 
first one, from the fact of their containing forcemeat. The 
legs must be boned without being cut open, and without the 
skin being injured, by drawing the drumstick, or tibia, with 
the skewer-like fibula through the round aperture which 
has to be made to separate the lower end from the skin. 
Into this hole you insert later a piece of the metatarsal or 
lowest leg-bone, with the foot or toes attached, all scalded 
and scraped, and the toes cut short, and tie the skin around 
it. Fill the cavity from above with a farce, or salpicon of 
fat liver, truffles and mushrooms, close the cavity by sewing 
the skin over it ; give to the bag the shape you desire, and 
braise it in a suitable manner with a poele, bacon, and 
herbs, and send it to table in a suitable sauce — green, Dutch, 
or crayfish butter. 

Many variations are on record : firstly, as to the mode of 
removing the hones, e.g., by longitudinal incision, which is 
easier than the extraction ; in this case the farce is laid in 
the cavity, and secured by sewing the skin together ; some 
cooks will have them larded, but this seems too complicated 
with farce ; they are frequently given with Financiere, Mace- 
doine, and Jardiniere ragout, and may be accompanied with 
dressed vegetables, such as lettuce, endive, sorrel, stewed 
peas, asparagus, or any of their purees. The pinions of 
fowls may be similarly treated ; when skilfully boned, they 
furnish little bags which may be stuffed with farce and 
braised. 

Foiol in all stages of carving and all its parts may receive 
many subsidiary preparations, of which we merely give the 
names : Cold Boast Foivl minced and grilled ; Cold Boast or 
Boiled Foiul minced au Gratin ; Cocks' Combs and Kidney sin 
Veloute Sauce ; Aspic of Cocks' Combs and Kidneys. Fat 
Livers of Foiuls, which are so frequently ruined by being 
burnt or dried during bad roasting, admit of very delicate 



488 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

preparation, such as a la Perigueux, or d la Financier e in 
a mould, or au Gratin with farce ; en Matelote, etc. The 
various forcemeats to be used in or with fowls should if 
possible be made of fowl or game, rabbit or veal, Boudins 
offoivls are quenelles poached in broth. Some of them are 
again to be filled with a salpicon ; such preparations may be 
of good tastf^, but verge towards Apician exaggeration. 



CHAPTEE XLV. 

PREPARATIONS OF TURKEY, GOOSE, DUCK, AND 

PIGEON. 

In the culinary language of this country, turkey is spoken 
of as such, without reference to the sex of the animal as 
hen or cock. In the ordinary French language the turkey- 
cock is un dindo7i, and the hen une dinde ; but in the 
terminology of the French kitchen both cock and hen are 
iin dinde. The hen is always smaller and more delicate 
than the male. 

Turkeys were known to the Greeks, who termed them 
meleagrides , because a king of Macedonia, Meleager, intro- 
duced them into Europe. It is related that the Greek 
tragic writer Sophocles had introduced into one of his now 
lost tragedies a chorus of turkeys which deplored the death 
of Meleager. 

The Komans bred Meleagrian birds at the time of 
Pliny, who describes them accurately. The animals then 
became so rare that they were no longer reared in open 
yards and fields, but shut up in cages, and after the Middle 
Ages turkeys were practically extinct in Europe. They 
were imported again in 1432, it is alleged by the French 



HISTORY AND DRESSING OF TURKEYS 489 



trader Jaques Coeur, then a great merchant, later Master 
of the Mint, or Treasurer and Director of Artillery in the 
service of Charles VII. of France. Hence the French 
name of ])oule cVIndc, transformed into dindc, or dindon ; 
and to show that the India here referred to was East India, 
the Germans, who received the turkey from France or Italy, 
and have termed it mostly Wdlscher-Hahn, or Welsch-HuJm, 
frequently yet call it a Calicut cock. (In North Germany 
the name of Filter- or Trut-Hahn is more common.) The 
turkey lived wild in America at the time of the discovery of 
that continent, and is not yet quite destroyed ; according 
to some authors we have received it from thence. Brillat- 
Savarin figures as the hero of a hunt for wild turkey. In the 
present day turkeys are reared all over the world, and in 
Spain we have seen flocks of many thousands. 

There are many modifications of the treatment which the 
turkey experiences after it has been killed and plucked, for 
the purpose of adapting it to the particular culinary opera- 
tion by which it is to be made an important feature of the 
dinner-table. Thus, the removal of the trail is effected by 
some through an incision at the back of the neck, and when 
the vent begins to be drawn in it is cut round with a sharp, 
narrow-bladed, pointed knife, and the small hole thus pro- 
duced is at once sewn up. Some then singe off the hair- 
like feathers, and divest the legs of their black skin by 
scalding; others break the leg-bone and draw out the 
sinews, many of which are bony, as in the pheasant ; all 
cut off the neck close to the back, leaving a portion of the 
skin of the neck adherent to that of the body. Some then 
break the keel of the breast-bone by laying a manifold cloth 
over it, and forcing it strongly on one side by pressure or 
blows with a bat, to make the breast appear more round 
and plump. The limbs are then fixed close to the sides by 
skewers, an operation called trussing ; some place the liver 
and gizzard in the angles of the pinions of the wings, which, 



490 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

in case the birds be roasted, causes them invariably to be 
spoiled ; they should always be treated in conjunction with 
some forcemeat, as a stuffing for parts of the turkey or the 
whole of its cavity. 

Upon the operation of atiijfing the turkey a vast amount 
of ingenuity has been expended. Thus, the disciples of the 
' Almanach,' at the head of these M. de Cussy, directed the 
turkey to be killed and drawn, and while warm to be filled 
with 8 lb. of truffles ; it was then to be hung as long as was 
compatible with preservation, to let the truffle flavour pene- 
trate the flesh, and then only was it to be plucked and 
trussed for cooking, receiving an entirely new stuffing [trujfes 
vierges) after the removal of the first truffles. 

A reasonable stuffing, or garnish in lieu of stuffing, is a 
great addition to the bird, and should rarely be omitted. 
Thus, of a plain forcemeat of veal and pork, well spiced, 
about a pound may be placed under the skin in front of the 
breast, that which holds the crop during life ; and such 
stuffing produces a hopeful impression of contents. A large 
turkey to be roasted or braised will take about 4 lb. of 
truffles in its cavity ; they should be previously fried with 
bacon, spices, and fat livers, including the liver of the 
turkey itself. It is then called dinde an tniffes or d la 
Perigord, and placed amongst the removes (De Courchamps). 
On the other hand, Brillat-Savarin termed the dinde an 
trujfes a roti. This was considered heretical by the sur- 
vivors of the orthodox fraternity of truffle-worshippers, and 
Courchamps, the old friend of Lauraguais and of the 
Ximeneses, who had often been a guest at the little soupers 
of Sophie Arnould and of Marshal Kichelieu, wrote the 
following note to his recipe, in w^hich, as Dumas says, one 
can recognise the hatred — one might almost say the con- 
tempt — which the nobility of the sword has alwaj^s shown 
for the nobility of the gown : 

' It is hardly necessary for us to observe that the dinde aux 



FRENCH DISCUSSIONS ON ROAST TURKEY 491 

truffes should only be served amongst the large dishes in the 
first service. Nothing is so heavily philistrose, and so much 
according to the taste of the Chaussee d'Antin, as to cause 
to be served, or even to allow to appear, a clinde aux truffes 
in the guise of a dish of roast (plat de rot). One does not 
comprehend how the author of the " Physiologie du Gout " 
has been able to deceive himself upon such a point. On the 
part of M. Brillat-Savarin this is the effect either of singular 
levity or of a prodigious illusion. The esteem which he 
had deserved in other respects, and the consideration with 
which his work has been treated, have much suffered by 
this.' 

This passage is an example of the illiberality bred by 
conceit. The proposition that a man's character is to come 
in question by his declaring an actually roasted turkey to 
be a roast is not only absurd, but outrageous. The world 
has accepted some refinement out of the practice of the 
French kitchen, but when its patrons attempt to impose a 
canon of dining, and to persecute those that do not conform 
to it with such language as that of M. de Courchamps just 
quoted, that same world will refuse to be befooled, and 
assert its right to eat turkey either as a remove or as a 
roast, or under any other appropriate title it may please. 

The philosophy of the actual roasting of the turkey cannot 
be exhaustively treated in this place. The bird may be 
roasted hare, or in an envelope composed of hacon and paper, 
or in paper only. It should not be basted during the roast- 
ing with any gravy or liquid capable of dissolving any part 
of the browning of the skin. M. de Cussy proposed seriously 
that any cook basting with gravy a turkey while being 
roasted should be dismissed at once and banished from 
France. 

The distinction between roasting, braising, and boiling is 
so little understood by some writers, that one of them 
entitles a certain preparation as boiled braised turkey, and 



492 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

another as roast braised turkey^ both containiDg incom- 
patible adjectives. On closer examination of these recipes, 
we find that the adjective hraised is meant merely to indicate 
the addition of the complement of vegetables which is mostly- 
added to braises, but which is not an essential part of the 
process at all. In the case of ' roast braised turkey,' the 
symphony of sliced vegetables mixed with oil is enclosed in 
the threefold paper in which the trussed turkey, whitened 
by slices of lemon, and covered with rashers of bacon, is 
wrapped and heated before the fire. In this case an effect 
of good braising, namely, the browning of the surface of the 
meat by radiated heat in an enclosed moist space, is actually 
prevented from being attained. The ca^ of the boiled 
turkey is worse, the conditions of the boiling process ex- 
cluding any braising at all, unless it were merely succeeded 
by the latter, which would be a laborious mode of operating. 
The lardimj of the turkey for braising excludes boiling. 

Turkey larded and braised is the dinde en daube of Beau- 
villiers. The bird is to be old, which means full-grown, at 
the end of its second or third year. In the present time 
turkey is rarely larded, but comaionly elaborately stuffed, 
braised, glaced, and, if eaten cold, garnished with aspic ; if 
eaten hot, the garnishes are more elaborate. Sausages, fried 
or boiled in broth (aicx chiiJolates), or introduced into the 
bird as forcemeat, are most welcome to the diners. Pre- 
pared chestnuts, with half their weight of chopped suet, or 
bacon well spiced, are also very suitable. Veal stuffing is 
less elegant. 

Boned and Stuffed Turkey is termed by French cooks 
dhidoji en ballon. We have improved this dish when 
intended for a large supper-party by having a smaller boned 
and stuffed turkey placed inside the larger boned turkey in 
an inverse direction, and filhng the intervals between again 
with farce. This should be braised and glaced. It might 
be termed a galantine. 



HISTORY AND PREPARATIONS OF GOOSE 493 



Some special forms of turkey are the following ; Roast 
Turkey a la Finaiiciere, a sumptuous dish ; Boiled Turkey 
filled with veal stuffing. Breasts or Fillets of Tttrkey are 
made and prepared like those of fowls. A number of pre- 
parations after methods, the philosophy of which has been 
discussed in earlier chapters, require no special notice. 

The Leg of Roast Turkey is much improved by a second 
braising with some savoury gravy and spice, or grilling, in 
which case it is termed devilled or helzehuhhed. 

The Goose was much valued in antiquity as a delicate dish 
by the Egyptians, and by the ancient Britons at the time 
of the invasion of Julius Caesar. It was also surrounded 
with a halo of sanctity, and used as an authority for the 
authentication of an oath by Rhadamanthus and his Lycian 
subjects. At Rome the goose was for a period not eaten, but 
honoured as the saviour of the Capitol from the besieging 
Gauls, but after Caesar's conquest of Gaul, geese, particularly 
those from Picardy in France, were largely imported into 
and consumed at Rome. A Roman consul, Metellus Scipio, 
invented, according to PHny, the art of fattening geese and 
making their livers more delicate. The learned physician 
Julius Caesar Scaliger had much humorous admiration for 
these animals. It may be interesting to cooks to know that 
the French chemist Memery saw a goose which had been 
trained by a cook to turn a spit. It seized the handle with 
the beak, and by alternately extending and contracting the 
neck it did the work of a turnspit. 

Some humorous sayings about roast goose exhibit the 
attractive quality of the flesh of the bird. A goose intended 
for roasting should not be excessively fat, as it will lose 
most of its grease during roasting. In trimming and trailing 
the goose, the lungs, technically called soal (or soul), which 
adhere to the chest-wall, are not removed. It may receive 
various kinds of stuffing, of which that made with sage and 
onions has been very popular, although, owing to the 



494 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

essential oil of the sage, it is rather indigestible. The best 
stuffing for a goose are small Dutch, or finger, potatoes, 
sliced fine, salted and peppered, and mixed with the kidney 
and caul fat from the interior of the goose, finely chopped, 
or half their weight of suet or scraped bacon. The same 
treatment is applicable to cJiestnuts when used to stuff a 
goose. Some farce or sausage meat may be mixed with 
them to increase their taste. The practice of eating ajjjjle 
sauce with goose has given rise to a particular kind of 
stuffing, described by Soyer, in which the apples and the 
sage and onions are blended with grated boiled potatoes. 
A sliarj) sauce for roast goose, described by Ignotus and 
Kitchiner, which was to be poured into the body of the 
goose, called by the former ' a secret worth knowing,' was 
evidently appreciated by these authors. 

A goose may be braised in the plain or stuffed condition ; 
when well done it practically becomes roast goose, but 
admits of being made more juicy. Steiued Goose may be 
immersed in an acidulous and savoury jelly or aspic. If the 
meat be boned it adds to the convenience of the cook as well 
as the consumer. 

Where, as in the lake districts of North Germany, 
hundreds of thousands of geese are annually reared to serve 
as human food, a great variety of preparations have to be 
employed to make the several parts of the animals eatable 
and transportable in a preserved state. The breast is 
mostly pickled and smoked, and sold as Pomeranian Goose 
Breast. It is eaten raw in thin slices, like Westphalian 
ham, with bread-and-butter, and is of excellent taste. The 
livers are transformed into pates. The other pieces of the 
geese are transformed into a pickled and stewed prepara- 
tion, which is preserved in fat, and consumed gradually 
during the winter. {Pokel-Gans = pickled goose.) A similar 
mode of curing, cooking, and preserving is practised at 
Bayonne in France. 



GREEN GEESE AND CYGNETS 495 



Geese are most suited for culinary purposes during the 
time from the second week in June to the first in Sep- 
tember. In the Itahan restaurants in London, half-grown 
geese (goslings) are served up as duck. A March goose 
gastronomers declare to be insipid, a Michaelmas goose 
rank. Geese are called green till they are about four 
months old ; such geese are yet used as second course 
roasts. The amateurs of these ' insipid premature pro- 
ductions ' do not allow them to be flavoured with sage 
and onions. 

Cygnets, or young swans, are used much as geese are. 
The early inhabitants of the Thames Valley probably feasted 
on the large black swan and his smaller white contemporary, 
of which bones are found in alluvial deposits. At present 
swans are no longer game with us, but must be reared in 
captivity. They are very prolific, and we have seen families 
of as many as nine cygnets on the protected and secluded 
waters of a park thirty miles distant from London. At 
Norwich, along with colossal herds of geese, cygnets are 
also reared, and are ready for the market in September. 
The cygnet is a dish of considerable size and weight, and 
requires some special facilities for cooking. It is prepared 
and trussed like goose, and receives a stuffing of which 3 lb. 
of minced rumpsteak is an essential ingredient ; it is then 
wrapped in oiled paper, water-paste, paper again, and 
roasted like venison ; this package requires at least four 
hours' roasting before a large fire, on the spit. It has to be 
frequently basted with butter, and ultimately frothed wath 
butter and flour. It would be far preferable to bake the 
cygnet in a good oven. Cygnets, like wild geese, early 
assume an oily taste ; this can be mitigated only by 
marinading and roasting before a free fire. 

Goose Liver may be prepared in the well-known Strass- 
burg manner, or in jelly ; or it may be criwibed and fried, 
or plain-fried. 



496 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



A variety of wild geese are suitable for the table — such as 
the barnacles of Wexford and Tralee in Ireland — but only 
in the first year of their existence ; in the second year they 
become tough, and acquire an oily or fishy taste, to be 
counteracted by marinading and roasting, and the accom- 
paniment of horseradish sauce. 

Ducks are mostly eaten roast, but are equally excellent 
en daube or braised. Green peas, fried turnips, or 
macedoine, are suitable garnishes ; the braised duck goes 
well with esimgnole. 

Roast Duck is mostly flavoured with a stuffing consisting 
of green sage ^ oz., onion 1 oz., and breadcrumb 2 oz., with 
fat and spice and salt. This is put into the cavity of the 
duck, and fills only a small part of it, and therefore can 
hardly be termed a stuffing ; for the idea ' to stuff ' in- 
volves that of filling completely. To delicate stomachs this 
stuffing is not very digestible. Steioed Duck or Duckling 
with Vegetables is a favourite dish, and admits of many 
variations. Fillets or Breasts of Duckling may be prepared 
a la bigarade, i.e., with the juice of Seville orange ; the 
rest of the bird is turned into a salmi. 

Wild Dtick, of which the male is called mallard, the 
young individual a fla2:)per, is a great resource of the 
autumnal and hiemal kitchen. It should be well hung 
before being dressed, and always roasted. It requires 
basting with butter, and from fifteen to twenty minutes, 
before a brisk fire. 

The Canvas-back Duck is a delicate bird of American 
origin. It should be cooked like our wild duck, but nearer 
to the fire, its fat being so hquid that it requires rapid 
coction not to run out. It is best eaten with plain gravy or 
sharp sauce. 

The cooking of wild ducks is different from that required 
by the domestic bird, in this, that it is never carried so far 
as in the case of the latter. Eeared ducks must always be 



VARIETIES AND PREPARATIONS OF PIGEON 497 



well done ; wild ducks are preferred only just, or rather 
under, done. Both are very suitable for treatment as a 
ragout with cassareep in the form of the West Indian 
pepper-pot. 

Of ])kjGons, French cooks distinguish four varieties as most 
suitable for cooking : Homaiiu (large birds), Cochois (from 
Picardie), Birets (in August), and it la Gautier (from Paris 
and neighbourhood). It is interesting to know this, as we 
receive many thousands of pigeons from France, Bordeaux 
pigeons being a standing article of trade. Pigeons are in 
greatest perfection from midsummer to Michaelmas, as there 
is then the most plentiful and best food for them ; their 
best condition is just when they are full-feathered. When 
they are in the pen-feathers, they are flabby ; when they 
are full-grown and have flown some time, they are tough. 
When pigeons are fresh they have their full flavour, but it 
disappears entirely when they are kept, and the slightest 
haut gotit makes them useless. They should therefore be 
roasted as soon as they are received, and if not used 
immediately, be kept in the roasted state, cold, and be re- 
heated for further use. 

Boast Pigeon is used as a second course roast, plain ; it 
will take about twenty minutes. It is much improved by a 
bland stuffing of forcemeat, veal, with egg, panada, and 
spices. The bird is basted with butter ; its cooking then 
requires half an hour. Pigeons may be larded and glaced, 
and garnished with mushrooms, or a ragoM of cochs' combs, 
or they may be broiled, grilled, or spitchcocked, an operation 
of which the French name is mettre a la crapaudine ; 
this last word signifies a grating. Steived Pigeon (named 
by some compote de pigeons) is a very useful dish for deli- 
cate or sick persons ; it admits of many variations, and is 
supreme with stewed green peas. Pigeon Pie in a dish is 
a favourite English preparation ; when wanted for sub- 
stantial nutrition, it receives a basis of rumpsteak; it re- 

32 



498 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

quires about an hour and a half's cooking in a moderately- 
heated oven, and the addition of strong gravy both before 
and after it is cooked. The cook indicates the presence of 
pigeon in the pie by fixing some claws of the bird on the 
outside of the crust. Pigeons may be braised, with quen- 
elles or a ragout ; they may be boned, stuffed, crumbed, or 
fried ; braised in a wine mirepoix, and garnished with a 
Spanish ragout {a la Seville). More comphcated prepara- 
tions are Pigeons au Gratin, in caiosules, a dish which is in 
reality a forcemeat pudding. Breasts or Fillets of Pigeon 
admit of the same forms of treatment as the fillet of fowls, 
but are more laborious to produce. 

The mode of dressing pigeons for stews, fricassee, braises, 
etc., in the most expeditious manner, should be studied in 
* Dons de Comus ' (t. ii., p. 196). Throw the pigeons just 
killed into warm water, beat the stomach and remove the 
crop ; now put them in hot water on the fire, and stir them 
until the feathers begin to come off; take them out and 
cool them at once ; remove the trail, causing the feet to 
enter the abdomen, and truss them with skewers. Give 
them shape, blanch in boiling water, and put in cool water. 
For roasts the pigeons are not treated with hot water, but 
plucked and singed in the ordinary manner (* Dons de 
Comus,' t. ii., p. 351).

The pheasant was brought by the Argonauts from the 
banks of the river Phasis, from which its name is derived. 



HISTORY AND PREPARATIONS OF PHEASANT 499 



From Greece it spread to Eome, and from thence to the 
rest of the world. It is nowhere encountered in a wild 
state, but requires the continued assistance of man for its 
preservation and multiplication. As a desirable object for 
the sportsman's gun, as well as the cook's art, it is reared 
in large numbers on the estates of many landed proprietors, 
and it is believed that a pheasant sold in the market gener- 
ally costs its rearer and original owner about three times as 
much as is the ultimate price paid by the consumer. 

Pheasants have shared with truffles the misfortune of 
becoming objects of an adoration on the part of gastro- 
philists which is sometimes purely ridiculous. * The flesh 
of the pheasant,' says Dumas, ' is perhaps the most delicate 
and the most tasty \pai)ide\ which can be found.' In 
reality these two adjectives contradict each other : the 
flesh is delicate, no doubt in this, that it has little taste, 
and therefore admits of being combined with a great variety 
of flavoured sauces and stuffings ; but what taste the 
pheasant has, when it is there, is of a specific and attractive 
nature. On the other hand, a great number of tasteless 
pheasants are encountered on dinner and supper tables. 
It has, however, the faculty of, when properly matured by 
keeping, or, as the French say, when properly mortified^ of 
being tender, short, and easily digested. It is for this 
reason most liked by aged and delicate persons. Of course, 
Brillat-Savarin has a fervent efiusion on this bird, which 
contains passages of such exquisite nonsense, that even 
pathetic declamation could not hide it : ' The pheasant is a 
riddle, of which the word ' (meaning the solution) ' is re- 
vealed only to the adepts.' ' Every substance has its 
apogee of excellence,' which ' the pheasant attains only 
when it begins to decompose.' By this tropic apogee was 
meant the highest degree, or climax. This it does not reach 
in less than three days after its death, requiring sometimes 
many more, and not rarely running into the space of hope- 



500 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

less destruction, like the comets which do not return, or 
the fire-ball meteors which burst. The necessary degree 
of mortification of the pheasant is recognised by its odour, 
and by the colour of its ventral aspect. Having attained 
this, it should be plucked and drawn ; the ventral cavity 
should be well washed out and deodorized by immersion 
for a few minutes in a pink solution of permanganate of 
potash. For these odours proceeding from the abdominal 
organs are in reality hurtful to the flavour developed in the 
meat, while the essences in the flesh are not reached by the 
deodorant suggested. 

The stuffing of the pheasant may be effected in various 
ways, and in various degrees of sumptuousness ; thus, 
according to Brillat-Savarin, you may incorporate with the 
farce intended to fill the bird the breasts of two luoodcocks ; 
mince them, add beef marrow or suet, scraped bacon, 
pepper, salt, fine herbs, and a suflicient number of truffles, 
and put all in its appointed place. In case the thin 
abdominal wall should appear not to be sufiiciently strong 
to keep the farce in the bird, place a crust of bread over it, 
and fasten it with a string; this will act as an efficient 
obturator. Prepare a yellow fried croustacle of bread, and 
cover it with the pounded trails and livers of the wood- 
cocks and two large truffles, an anchovy, some scraped 
bacon, and a lump of butter ; place the croustade thus 
covered underneath the pheasant while it is being roasted, 
so that all the juice flowing from it may be sucked up by 
the croustade. Dish the pheasant on the croustade, and 
garnish it with slices of Seville oranges. 

As an example of a still greater apogee d'escidence than 
the one described, by which it was, however, suggested, we 
give the recipe for a braised pheasant galantined with ivood- 
cocks, called Faisan Lucullus, and invented by Vuillemot, 
the collaborator on the Dictionary of Dumas, and once mine 
host of the Tete Noire at St. Cloud : Obtain a fine fat 



FA IS AN L UCULL US 501 



cock pheasant, such as they are in November, and take 
care it was snared, and not pierced by shot. Prepare and 
bone it ; place it in a mirepoix made of sliced carrots, 
onions, herbs, all fried in butter, and a bottle of effervescent 
champagne, a bottle of sauterne, half a glassful of madeira, 
and a pint of consomme ; let all boil during four hours. 
During the interval, prepare a farce of veal, bacon, chopped 
truffle-parings, salt, pepper, allspice ; also have ready some 
slices of veal, ham, and fat bacon. Have, further, ready 
two boned woodcocks, and stuff them lightly with these 
ingredients ; then pack them inside the pheasant into the 
cavity {cojfre) in which you have placed only a little farce 
to serve as mortar, and chopped truffles. Sew up the 
pheasant, and wrap it in a well-buttered cloth, tying it 
strongly all round so that it cannot burst. Put this into a 
braising-pan ; add a mirepoix, and a bottle of champagne, 
a bottle of sauterne, a bottle of madeira ; boil all strongly 
until it be reduced to half its bulk ; then let it simmer for 
two hours more. Probe the galantine from time to time to 
assure yourself that it be well cooked. When the pheasant 
is taken out of the cloth, it is to be garnished with twelve 
ortolans stuffed with the farce as above, and boiled with 
truffles in the pheasant's mirepoix, and is to be glaced, as 
well as the ortolans, with meat glace. Adorn the pheasant 
with skewers bearing cocks' combs, crayfish, and truffles, 
and send to table ; offer the sauce (coulis) in a separate 
sauce tureen or boat. 

When a pheasant has been boiled for six hours in 
altogether more than five bottles of wine, it has no longer 
any taste of its own ; it is therefore a mere neutral carrier 
of the taste of its contents. We advise the omission of 
the absurd extravagance in wine, and the braising of the 
pheasant in a standard mirepoix without any wine whatever. 
For roasting, a pheasant should be young, fat, and tender. 
Some cooks leave the feathers of head and tail on, and 



502 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

protect them during roasting by oiled paper. In our view, 
such a roast is as disagreeable a sight as the roast hare 
crouching, and with its head and ears standing up. The 
roasting of a pheasant in slices of bacon and oiled paper 
takes about half an hour ; it should be frothed or 
browned with flour, salt and butter just before being sent 
to table. 

Our medical friend Ignotus directs a pheasant cock 
to be stuffed with the lean part of a sirloin of beef cut 
in pieces of the size of dice, and spiced with pepper and 
salt. During roasting, the gravy of the beef diffuses itself 
through the flesh of the pheasant, thereby rendering it 
more juicy, tasty, and tender. Veal, being a white meat, 
may be preferred by some, but requires more flavoured 
additions. The recipe also says that early in the present 
century the pheasant was generally larded, but that 
many persons objected to the taste of bacon which it 
acquired by exposure to dry culinary heat. 

For braising, a pheasant should be well larded, stuffed, 
garnished, and immersed in standard gravy, and when 
done be served with a ragout of fat livers, sweetbread, 
mushrooms, truffles, etc. 

Pheasant is very suitable for game ]jies and jj«s^/es, and 
in that form was by cooks of the last century placed into 
oval 2^otting-pots, cooked to the point, and covered hot with 
a thick layer of fat aromatized by braising. In this state 
the pie was kept for months, and preserved as well as tinned 
meat is nowadays, but, of course, not suitable for transport. 
The most suitable fat for such preservation is that from a 
boiled ham which is in course of being cut. 

The accomplished cook Simpson, founder of the celebrated 
restaurant in the Strand, gives (in his work on cookery of 
1716) only two recipes for pheasant, while in current 
modern English works we find more than twenty. But on 
investigation, the latter are seen to be mostly mere varia- 



VARIETIES OF PARTRIDGES 503 

tiona of roast and braised forms, and to possess no speci- 
ficity beyond tbe sauce or ragout with which they are 
garnished. 

Thus, we find Pheasantfi tvith Truffles, or a la Peiigueux, 
a copy of truffled turkey ; Pheasants a la Chipolata ; 
Pheasants roasted in Papillote with Bavioli ; Pheasants 
honed, stuffed, and roast ; Pheasants studded with Truffles 
and stuffed with Chestnuts (syn. faisan hrais& a VAngou- 
77ioise) ; Pheasants fried in the Pan ; Pheasants loith Sour- 
kraut ; Breasts of Pheasants, when small, to be dressed 
in all forms of the breasts of fowl (fillets). Salmis, 
escalopes, pat^s, boudins, and quenelles of pheasant are all 
made according to the prescriptions relating to the analogous 
preparations of fowls. 

Of partridges Europe possesses several varieties, of which 
four are most esteemed for eating ; these are the ordinary 
gray partridge, the red-legged partridge, the havtaveUe, and 
the rock partridge. Bartavelle is one of the names of the 
Greek partridge; this bird is larger than, but otherwise 
very similar to, the red-legged variety. It is common in 
the Orient, Sicily, and Naples, and never descends into the 
plain from the mountainous and alpine regions in which it 
lives. One of the epigrammatists and poets, Julius Caesar 
Scaliger, who lived early in the sixteenth century, said that 
this bird was derived from Mount Olympus, and had pre- 
served the consciousness of the grandeur of its origin. 
Bene of Anjou, King of Naples, imported it from the island 
of Ohio, and acclimatized it in the Proven9e. There are 
many culinary observations extant regarding the bartavelles, 
but they are all of an exaggei'ated nature. Thus, Cyrano 
of Bergerac said that they were as much superior to 
ordinary gray partridges as cardinals are above mendicant 
friars. Reyniere blustered, as usual, that the diner should 
go on his knees before them, and eat them in the attitude 
of adoration ; and the author of the * Memoires of Madame 



504 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

de Crequi ' advised that they should be larded and barded, 
/.c, roasted in an envelope of thin slices of bacon. But 
Vuillemot opposed this, as he did the larding of all game. 

According to Vincent Leblanc, there are in Bengal white 
partridges of larger size than the European gray ones. The 
red-legged i)artridgc, which is very common in the South of 
Europe, is little larger than the gray, and in our opinion 
equally good to eat. But different persons have different 
predilections, and the question, in itself irrelevant, which 
of the two varieties is culinarily preferable, will probably 
never be decided. The recipes for cooking apply equally to 
both. 

We may have them roast, steiued, fried, braised, with 
various supports, such as mushrooms, cepes, or truffles ; or 
they may be egged, crumbed, and grilled {a la crajmudine). 
They may be dressed as salmis, or as breasts or fillets. 
These latter pass under all the forms and names under 
which the fillets of fowls and pheasants are presented. 
The boudins complete the list. 

Woodcock, in French bdcasse, and its smaller varieties, 
s^iijje (becassine) and sandjnper {becasseaii ; this last name 
is also used for young woodcock), are the most important of 
paludal dark-fleshed birds, and much coveted by the lovers 
of good fare and sportsman's dishes. 

In the middle of Europe it occurs as a bird of passage, 
spending the winter in Africa, and breeding in summer 
in northern latitudes or mountainous regions, such as 
the Alps and Pyrenees. But it travels so slowly that it is 
obtained for the kitchen during three months of the year. 
It has become much more scarce during the present century. 
Woodcock should be fat. It is always better during frosty 
weather or in autumn ; it must be kept for some time after 
it has been shot. It can be roasted on the spit, wrapped in 
slices of bacon, but must not be over-done. Some, indeed, 
like the bird very much underdone, and direct that it should 



WOODCOCK AND SNIPE AND THEIR TRAIL 505 



be just introduced to the cook for her to show it the fire, 
and then send it up to table. We have above seen its use 
in the boned state as material for a galantine of pheasant ; 
it also yields a delicious puree (but for this tough birds only 
should be used), on which larded partridge fillets may be 
placed. As salmis, woodcock is raised by truffles in taste ; 
but its flavour always remains peculiar, and it does not 
agree with everybody's digestion. Eetrievers do not like 
the smell of it, and not rarely decline to bring it in. Elzear 
Blaze, "^ a noted French sportsman and cook (1786-1848), 
was enthusiastic in his praise of the woodcock. 

Both woodcock and snipe are remarkable by the fact of 
the contents of their trail being eaten and considered a 
delicacy. Like the contents of the lobster's stomach, the 
contents of the trail of these birds consist of digested 
animal matter, mostly paludal and terrestrial insects, worms, 
etc., and though a little sandy occasionally, taste, when 
properly spiced, like a fine farce. Some draw the trail 
before cooking the bird, some only when it is half cooked ; 
its contents are then mixed with the pounded liver and 
spice and mustard on a silver plate, and further treated. 
Either the woodcock, cut in four quarters, is placed upon 
this, and its roasting completed in the oven, or the mixture 
from the silver plate is spread over a light yellow fried 
croustade, and the bird is placed and sent to table on 
this. 

Woodcock is trussed for roasting by having its long thin 
beak run through both feet like a skewer. A sx>ortsman's 
curiosity consists in roasting the bird entire, drawing it, 
isolating and spicing the contents of the trail, and rubbing 
them over the bird cut in four quarters. Each quarter, spitted 
on a fork, is then held over or into a flame of burning rum 
or spirit, and when fried handed to expectant diners. We 

* Blaze wrote five works on the chase, one of them being a collection 
of sportsman's anecdotes. 



5o6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



have, further, salmis of woodcock and snipe ; we have them 
with truffles, or minced in croustades, their fillets fried in 
butter, braised, etc. They receive the usual conventional 
names, which have in them no element of fixity, and do not 
call for detailed notice. 

Scotch Woodcock, an analogue of Welsh rabbit, is a 
preparation of buttered toast with anchovies, eggs and 
cream, set over the fire, and should not be confounded with 
any preparation of real woodcock. 

Widgeon (Fr. sarcelle) and teal are wild birds of the 
duck tribe, and may receive the same culinary treatment. 
They may be roasted, but require a sharp, t.e., acidulous and 
hot, sauce ; they yield good salmis ov fillets of breast. When 
they taste fishy they must be marinaded, and then yield 
good ragouts. By a process of generalization from the 
examples of goose, and duck, and fowl, culinary writers 
have arrived at many recipes for the preparation of these 
birds. None of them show any specificity in the preparation 
of the birds themselves, which are always to be roasted 
before being treated further. This is evidently the result of 
their peculiar flavour. The variation which gives the 
pretext for the title is always in the sauce or garnish 
only. 

Ortolans are rarely eaten in England ; when obtainable, 
they are said to come from Belgium ; they are in season in 
September, but in the South of France, e.g., at Toulouse, 
they can be had in numbers in June, being probably animals 
caught in spring and kept in cages. Ortolans may be 
baked on croustades lined with farce, or rubbed with butter, 
crumbed, and roasted for ten minutes only ; they may also 
be roasted in paper, j^ajnllotes or caisses, and accompanied 
with a good sauce. 

Wheatears (Fr. motteux, cul blanc) are in season in 
August, and are rarely to be had in London ; they are 
more plentiful at Brighton, in the neighbourhood of which 



WHEATEARS AND LARKS 507 



town they are sometimes caught in numbers. They are 
only two-thirds of the size of larks, but when in good 
condition they are so fat as to resemble a small lump of 
butter. They may be roasted or baked in oiled paper 
cases, each case taking two little birds, and some minced 
and prepared mushroom. 

Larks afford, like quails, a remarkable illustration of the 
differences in the views of things at which men may 
arrive under different circumstances. In this country, and 
on the Continent, many persons strongly object to the 
killing and eating of larks, while in the South of Europe 
these birds are such a nuisance at certain times, that they 
have to be killed in numbers in order to reduce the damage 
which they inflict on agriculture. Migratory birds, they 
collect in the southern peninsulas which project into 
the Mediterranean, and are dying, or being killed by birds 
of prey and men, in enormous numbers. The ancient 
Athenians ate many larks, as do the southern Spaniards of 
the present day, when quails are not plentiful. They were 
preserved, and it was forbidden to kill them on the island 
of Lemnos, as it was erroneously believed that they had 
saved it from the locusts. The lark in the French language 
has a commonplace name besides a special culinary one ; 
it remains an alouette until it is plucked, trussed, and ready 
to be spitted, and then it becomes a mauviette. The Eaglish 
physician Lister, of the time of Queen Anne, laid it down 
as a principle concerning the culinary use of larks, that 
unless of twelve larks each did weigh at least 7 drachms, 
they were not eatable ; if they weighed as much they were 
passable, and if they weighed together 100 drachms, or 
12 J oz., or more, they were excellent. 

The preparations of larks are roasting in the plain or 
egged and crumbed sta^te, frying and braising in the stuffed 
or empty state. A good mode is to bed the larks on some 
farce on a silver dish or in a braising-pan, to cover them 



5oS THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

with slices of bacon and an oiled paper, and bake them in 
a French field or country stove so called {fourde campagne), 
or in an oven. Various other preparations are characterized 
by a ragout or sauce only. 

Buffs, the males, and reeves, the females, of the species 
tringa (in French le comhattant), are best towards the end 
of May. They are caught in nets, kept in boxes and 
fattened, and then roasted or fried like larks. 

Quails, French cailles, are also migratory birds, breeding 
in temperate latitudes, and wintering in more southerly 
climes. The European quails spend the winter mainly in 
Africa. When in early autumn they arrive from the north 
in the southern parts of Europe, they are mostly in excel- 
lent condition. The flocks, which comprise thousands of 
individuals, consist mainly of young birds. After their 
arrival they are chased by sportsmen as well as the people, 
and thousands are slain, with sticks or shot, and snared 
or netted ; and it is for this wholesale destruction that the 
German peasant unwittingly preserves and surrounds with 
a halo of sanctity the nests and young of the revered 
Wachtel. Again, when the quails return from Africa and 
land exhausted on islands or peninsulas of the northern 
Mediterranean, they meet with the same reception. In 
the spring of 1894 a steamer of the French Messageries 
from Alexandria carried 90,000 quails in boxes. The ship 
being delayed by adverse weather, the food provided proved 
insufficient, and several thousands of birds died of starvation 
before reaching Marseilles. 

By the common consent of gastronomers, quail is never 
cooked in any other way than as roast in a paper case 
(rotie en pajnllote) ; its flavour is very volatile, and when- 
ever the bird is brought in contact with liquid, the perfume 
evaporates and is lost. For the oiled paper case a thin 
envelope of bacon may be substituted, with a vine-leaf 
applied to the breast. A vine-leaf underneath the bacon is 



QUAIL AND GROUSE 509 

applicable only in case it be desired to keep the roasts for 
some time in a cold state ; then the vine-leaf prevents it 
from getting dry. 

A recipe for Quails cm Gratin comes from Beauvilliers. 
The birds are boned and stuffed with a farce cm gratin, 
bedded on and imbedded in farce, and baked on a silver 
dish. Quails loith Truffles, or cl la Finaiicierc, are also to be 
boned, stuffed, and braised, or twice egged, crumbed, and 
fried, garnished with Toulouse ragout and quenelle force- 
meat. The breasts or fillets admit of all the preparation 
given for fowl and pheasant. Other braised forms some- 
times produced in the French kitchen are grotesque ragouts, 
such as Cailles a VAnglaise, in which eight quails, a calf's 
brain in halves, and nine chipolata sausages are cooked 
with bacon, bouillon and champagne ; or Cailles a la Cenclre 
cmx Ecrevisscs, a funny mixture of quails and crayfish, 
calculated for a show dish in the restaurant. 

Numerous are the preparations termed fillets, or scallo'iJS 
(which had better be termed bouchees), all named after 
sauces or ragouts with which they are allied. Some receive 
names from particular herbs, which are intended to impart 
their flavour, such as au Icmrier, au basilic. Others, 
again, are to be covered with saljncon, and repose on arti- 
cJwkes. Of ragouts there is one called en compote, another 
poiipeton, because baked in a mould ; a third and good 
recipe refers to a pate chaud ; there are also several tourtes 
cle cailles, but with little specificity. There are given in 
different books recipes for seven varieties of soup, all 
characterized by the presence of quail. One bears the absurd 
name of Bisqiie de Cailles. In these preparations the 
characteristic flavour of the birds is entirely lost. 

Of grouse there are in this country three kinds, the 
black, the red, and the white. The male black grouse in the 
North is called blackcock (in French coq de bruyhe) ; 
the female is called gray hen. In the South of England 



510 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



male and female are called heath-poults. The 7'ed grouse is 
also termed gorcock, or moorcock, or moorgame (in French 
attagas). The ivhite grouse is better known as ptarmigan 
(French lagopkle) ; it comes to us from Norway during the 
time from February to May, when its plumage is white ; in 
summer it assumes a gray plumage. There is also a large 
kind of grouse known as ivood-g rouse, or capercailzie, 
German AuerJmhn, which comes to us from Norway, and 
in more southern countries is shot like the woodcock, as a 
bird of passage in spring and autumn. In size it may 
exceed a domestic cock. It has an enormous breast, of 
dark and light-brown meat ; its skin is sometimes so hard 
that it has to be removed. Its legs are never worth any 
attempt at eating, as they are always hard, and contain 
numbers of bony tendons, much larger and more numerous 
than those in pheasant and partridge legs. All birds of 
the grouse family should always be roasted. An excellent 
garnish for them is sauerkraut, stewed with butter, standard 
broth, and a little wine. 

The becca-fica, hec-figue of the French [avis Cypria of 
the ancients, as it was brought to Greece and Rome from 
Cyprus, in a preserved state), is eaten roasted in buttered 
or oiled paper, and the roast is distinguished by three 
qualities — its fat, its flavour, and a slight bitterness of the 
flesh. Of these three qualities, Brillat-Savarin says that they 
fill and beautify all the digestive poioers. But this is again 
modified later on by the statement that all the merit the 
birds possessed was their fat. In France they are confined 
to the south and east ; in Italy they are more frequent. In 
France, at Belly, bec-figues, birds of passage, appear in the 
first days of January, and disappear about the 25th of that 
month. Dumas tells an anecdote concerning a gastro- 
philist, Pere Faby, who always came to Belly during the 
January season, and was a great lover of a dish of these 
birds, This was so well known, that when the cry went in 



BECCA-FICAS - 511 



the village, ' The bec-figues ! the bec-figues !' it was said, 
* Father Faby is coming !' This ecclesiastic was appointed 
Grand Penitentiary at Eome, and then ceased to come to 
Belly for the bec-figue season. Dumas says that the 
greatest penitence he suffered was that he could eat no 
more bec-figues in Proven9e. Let us hope that he imposed 
no greater penitence upon his victims. 

Unlike ortolans, larks, and quails, the bec-figue cannot be 
eaten ; it can only be chewed entire, and the consomme of 
flavours stowed in its roasted carcase can be sucked out. 
Such is the advice of the Canon Charcot, namesake of the 
renowned physician quoted by Brillat-Savarin. 

Dumas relates that a King Ferdinand of Naples lost his 
throne by going after the becca-ficas, instead of remaining 
with his Council of State, when he had been informed that 
the birds had arrived at his shooting-box at Capodimonte. 
' Do what you like, and go to the devil !' he said to his 
councillors. They did what they liked, but it was he who 
went to the devil. These birds bear their name from their 
love for figs ; they are said even to eat figs in Sussex in 
summer and autumn. 

The seven soups of quails (cf. D.D. 325 to 345 ; 
F. 1041 to 1050) are the result of the exodus reminiscence 
methodized in a magiric mind v/hich expected imports 
from Egypt. The desert may furnish quails sometimes, 
but the great bulk of the birds and the grease to fry them 
in have always been whipped out of Egypt. 



CHAPTER XLVII. 

PREPARATIONS OF SALT-WATER OR SEA FISH. 

Fish are a grand resource of human alimentation ; they 
furnish not only some of the most delicate dishes, but 



512 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

supply the cheapest animal food, as well in the fresh as 
in the salted, dried, tinned, or oil -immersed condition. 
Montesquieu attributed the populosity of coasts and river 
valleys to the frequent use of fish as one of the causes ; 
and there is no doubt that populations who make use of 
fish as a regular part of nutrition are better fed than 
those to whom it is inaccessible, although in other re- 
spects they may be subject to greater privations than the 
latter. The preparation of fish, and its preservation in such 
a form that an aesthetically educated or naturally disposed 
person may be able to eat it with enjoyment, is an invention 
of the cultured part of mankind, and is of relatively modern 
date. Thus, the preservation of herrings by salting, smoking, 
and drying is said to have been, at least systematically, in- 
troduced (if not invented) in the Netherlands by a Dutch- 
man of the name of Bucking, and it is related that the 
Emperor Charles V. visited the grave of that man as that 
of a benefactor of mankind. Preservation by mere salting 
was practised in antiquity, also the preserving in oil and 
aromatic mixtures ; the escaheached'*' fish of the Italians and 
Spaniards of our time is but a tradition of an ancient mode 
of preparation. There are very few special records of the 
manner in which the ancients prepared the various de- 
scriptions of fish which they ate ; but some are important, 
e.g., the recipe of Galen, prescribing that tunny should be 
salted before use, as in that state its flesh was less dense 
or hard. There are many anecdotal records of matters 
connected with fish, which show the appreciation given 
to it by wealthy persons, such as LucuUus, who had a lake 
near Naples put into communication with the sea in order 
to be able to preserve marine fish in it ; on account of the

tocjCi. In the neighbourhood of this place, where LucuUus 
carried out this feat, stands a monument known in archaeo- 
logy as tlie, temple of Serapis, remarkable in geological 
science as a supposed means of proving the repeated 
raising and sinking of the territory on w^hich it stands, 
under the influence of volcanic action. These ruins are now 
supposed to be the remains of a piscina, or fish-preserving 
pond; and from a consideration of all the arguments 
advanced in this discussion, some are inclined to accede 
to the latest interpretation. All housekeepers and cooks 
should be acquainted with the proper seasons for the use of 
fish, and the times during which this kind of food is mi- 
seasonable. Some Grimsby firms publish lists containing 
all necessary information on this subject, and to such 
circulars we would refer our readers. 

Fish may be prepared in the kitchen for being eaten by 
boiling in water or broth, by baking in an oven, by broiling 
before a fire, by frying in fat in a pan, by steiuing in a com- 
pound sauce with vegetables, and by braising under similar 
conditions. All other forms of preparations are mere 
variations of these principal processes. We therefore 
confine ourselves to a survey of the principles of the main 
processes only. 

The Boiling of Fish. — It is necessary that all fish before 
being eaten should be heated up in some way to a tempera- 
ture at which all germs of a vegetable or animal nature 
which may be living in fish are dead. This is the first rule 
of safety in the consumption of fish, and must be enforced 
with regard to them as vigorously as with regard to veal or 
pork, and for similar reasons ; for it has been proved that 
several varieties of fish harbour in their flesh the young 
forms of certain parasites, which, when they escape being 
killed by the process of cooking, and are eaten by man, 
develop in his intestine into the adult form of the parasite, 
and cause serious illness and long-continued disturbance.

514 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Thus, the early form of the Botryocephahis latus, and per- 
haps other varieties of the species, Hve in the flesh of the 
inke or jacJ:, and are imported into man probably by its 
agency. This parasite is endemic in Northern Eussia, in 
Switzerland, and the South of France. The parasites of 
sea-water fish are more injurious to the piscivorous animals, 
including fishes devouring their own kind, than to man, 
but, nevertheless, should be guarded against by all means. 
This is the n:iore easy as the rule for safety coincides wuth 
the desire for good taste of the fish. All fish must be 
cooked in some way before it is eatable (we do not at 
present speak of shellfish), and of all modes of cooking, 
boiling is the easiest and most certain in effect. 

Fish should not be boiled in common water unless there 
be added to it a quantity of salt equal to a quarter of a pound 
to the gallon, or an ounce to the quart of water. Whenever 
sea-icatcr is available for boiling fish, it should be preferred 
to salted water ; as the Dutch commonly use sea-water, 
and produce excellently cooked fish, the dish thus produced 
by the aid of sea-water is termed by the French a I'Hol- 
landaise. When fish is boiled in a mixture of wine, vinegar, 
roots, rhizomes, and spices, it is called au coitrt bouillon, and 
when the wine used in this process is in part red, the fish is 
said to be done au bleu ; there is, how^ever, also fish, e.g., 
eel, done blue, in the confection of which red w4ne has no 
part. When fish is boiled in broth, or in water impreg- 
nated with vegetables and spices, it is called a la bonne 
eau, and then the fish may be sent to table in some of the 
soup-like liquid ; what is called souchy or soucJiet is a slice 
of fish boiled in such broth or water with vegetables. The 
water should always be, as regards quantity, the minimum 
with which the purpose can be effected ; excessive quantities 
of water make the fish tasteless. Opinions differ as regards 
the initial temperature of the water, between the extremes 
of rohl and boilinr/, some proposing an uncertain medium 



BOILING OF SALT-WATER OR SEA FISH 515 

called tepid. Small fish, or relatively small slices of fish, 
may be thrown into boiling water, just as well as into 
boiling fat for frying, and become w^ell done ; but larger 
fish, or more voluminous pieces of fish, should be put into 
tepid, relatively cold water, so that they may bo penetrated 
by the heat gradually, and cooked equally throughout, and 
not overdone on the outside before the inside has begun to 
be set. For the same reason here set forth, the vessel in 
which fish is to be boiled must in a certain measure be pro- 
portionate in size to the fish to be boiled, for failing this, 
the other conditions of success, particularly that concerning 
the minimum quantity of fluid, cannot be maintained ; the 
cook should, therefore, have at least two fish-kettles of 
different sizes at his disposal ; each kettle should be pro- 
vided with a stramer, of perforated tin, with supports, by 
means of which it can be kept raised above the water. For 
when the fish is done, but its dishing is delayed, it should not 
be left in the water, but raised out of it on the strainer, and 
kept merely steamed, with the lid of the kettle on. On 
account of this difficulty of keeping boiled fish without 
deterioration, Kitchiner advises cooks, when they have 
large dinners to prepare for uncertain guests, to fry or 
stew their fish instead of boiling it ; they would, he says, 
get more credit by it, and the carving would be easier. 

Fish cannot be too fresh for any purpose of the kitchen. 
The Dutch are as nice about this point in the present day 
as the Romans, according to Seneca, were in the past ; the 
most fastidious would not eat fish unless it were cooked 
upon the same day that it was taken, that it might taste of 
the sea, as they expressed it. We can fully confirm that 
fish loses much of its original taste by being kept even on 
ice. So strong is this taste of fresh fish, that persons not 
accustomed to it, or not acquainted with the fact, have been 
known to object to it, and urban fishmongers have assured 
Kitchiner that very fresh fish now and then put them in 



5i6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



danger of losing their credit. Housekeepers and cooks 
should therefore, whenever they have an opportunity, 
acquire a knowledge of the taste and appearance of fresh 
fish, such as it is a few hours after it has been caught and 
brought to the market by the fishermen at the sea coast. 

Baking may advantageously be applied to several kinds of 
fish, particularly when they are well stuffed with a rich 
forcemeat containing plenty of fat, butter, or suet ; the out- 
side of the fish must also be well painted, or basted, with 
butter or oil, and a fish which is naturally tasteless should 
be supported with some vinegar and herbs and spices put 
in its inside, and protected from being scorched by an oiled 
paper placed over it. The process of baking thus becomes 
assimilated to that of braising. Kitchiner was in the habit 
of baking small codfish, haddock, mackerel, with a dust of 
flour and some butter put over them; eels, when large and 
stuffed; herrings and sprats in a brown pan, with vinegar 
and a little spice, and tied over with a paper. We have 
found stuffed and baked gurnet and haddock, each with a 
brown sauce, very useful and tasty preparations. But as 
regards mackerel, we have found no form superior, or even 
equal, to the broiled ; it comes nearest to broiled when it is 
stuffed, spiced, dipped in oil or liquid butter, enveloped in 
oiled paper, and baked. Carp is directed to be egged and 
crumbed, larger fish to be sliced before being baked. 

The broiling of fish on the gridiron should be preceded 
by wiping it dry, dredging it with flour, dipping it in olive 
oil, or covering it with egg and crumb, or chopped herbs, or 
dipping it in oil or butter only. Some kinds of fish can be 
eaten in the broiled form only — e.g., sprats; the heat dis- 
sipates or changes a kiud of oil contained in them, which 
spoils, according to our experiments, any other form of pre- 
paration. For similar reasons other kinds of fish have to 
be soaked in so-called marinades, and are thereby made 
more tender and better flavoured ; others, again, have to be 



FRYING, STEIVIXG, AXD COLLARING OF SEA FISH 51? 

crimped in boiling water, and then broiled. A mackerel 
should be split for broiling ; slices of salmon or red mullet, 
and several others, should be grilled in paper envelopes. 

Frying is applicable to small fish in its entirety, or to 
slices and fillets of fish ; the piece to be fried should always 
be egged and crumbed. Mullet should be scored up on 
each side. Wliitings and small jack are to be bent in a 
circle, and fixed in that position by skewers. Many 
varieties of fish are more conveniently fried after having 
been filleted ; that is to say, after their flesh has been cut 
off the bones and divided in pretty equal pieces, dredged 
with flour, or egged and crumbed, or dipped in batter. Fry 
in hot oil or butter, and drain the friture of fat by placing 
it on absorbent or bibulous paper, sprinkle it with salt, and 
dish it upon a napkin or absorbent paper punched to a 
pattern or design. 

Stewing is less frequently applicable to fish than the 
previously considered modes of cooking. Eels and lampreys 
are stewed cut in slices ; other fish require to be filleted 
before being stewed ; the larger varieties must be cut in 
small slices (scollops or kebobs). Fry them in fat with a 
little onion, and herbs and spices ; then add standard gravy, 
and stew for fifteen minutes or more, if the slices be large ; 
add some wine ; thicken the sauce with yolk, or roux, and 
point with any essence or ketchup at hand to increase the 
savoury character of the sauce. Some writers make a dis- 
tinction between a stew and a fricassee of fish, which is 
based mainly upon the omission, in the case of stewing, of 
the preliminary frying. We think the distinction unim- 
portant and unnecessary, and, moreover, hold that the term 
fricassee, originally applied to a preparation of chicken only, 
should not be extended to fish. 

The collaring of fish signifies a process which consists in 
isolating in one piece the whole of the flesh of one side (or 
of both sides) of a fish, divesting it of head, tail, fins, and 



5i8 7^HE SPIRU OF COOKERY 



bones, rubbing ifc on both sides with spices, finely-shred 
herbs, and salt ; roiling it up as tightly as possible, tying it 
securely with broad tape, putting a collaring cloth around 
it, placing it in a saucepan in which there is a boiling liquor 
composed of equal parts of water or standard broth and 
vinegar, spiced with bay-leaves, sweet herbs, and salt. 
Simmer all very slowly until the fish be done, then take the 
latter out and let it cool in the cloth, in case you do not 
want it for immediate service ; reduce the liquor by boiling, 
strain it, and when it is cold pour it over the fish, or 
instead of this you may give a separately made piquant 
sauce with it. 

From many of the recipes concerning the preparation of 
fish given in culinary treatises, the addition of the element of 
savour derived from meat has been omitted, except in sauces 
and mirepoix. This deficiency, easily discovered by an ex- 
perienced taste, the authors of the treatises have attempted 
to make up for by a forcible and profuse addition of wine 
and spirit, a counterpart to the absurdity of the bouillon of 
the faisan Lucullus. Thus, in a modern culinary treatise, 
we find the following recipe for Court Bouillon, which is 
translated * Sauce Court Bouillon ' : * Fill a fishpan nearly 
to the brim with white wine, a wineglassful of brandy, the 
same quantity of sherry, and "season" with salt, pepper, 
two "heads" of cloves, "a head" of garlic, sliced onions, 
carrots, turnips, parsnips, celery, chervil, parsley, a bayleaf, 
thyme, and " a lump " of fresh butter. Boil over a quick 
fire till reduced a third [this means, probably, by a third to a 
residue of two thirds] ; if the wine catches fire, it will greatly 
improve the flavour of the sauce. When used for cooking 
fish, see that the court bouillon is boiling before putting it 
(the fish) in, and have sufQcient to cover the fish entirely.' 
Two-thirds of a fishpan full of reduced court bouillon is a 
large volume of liquid to be worked into a * sauce ' ; but 
this proposition does not impose upon us, as, the translated 



ROMAN GARUM MADE OF SEA FISH 519 



heading notwithstaiidiDg, * court bouillon ' is not a sauce, 
but a material to boil fish in, or to marinade fish in by 
pouring the boiling bouillon over the fish and letting it cool. 
It is stated to l)e used to bind certain fish sauces with * a 
lier certaines sauces de poisson' (D.D. -167, 468), but this 
is the least \Yell defined of its uses. In the recipe just con- 
sidered, the fish is entirely forgotten, and the boiling down 
to two-thirds is without any meaning. 

From other sources of information we learn, that the fish 
boiled in court bouillon is to be dished on a plate with a 
napkin intervening, and to be eaten with oil and vinegar, 
proof sufficient that in this case at least it is not to be 
accompanied by any portion of the court bouillon as a sauce. 
In other recipes, however, this is the case. The writer in- 
forms us that a more economical way of preparing ' this 
sauce ' was by using equal quantities of vinegar and water 
instead of white wine, and by omitting some of the vege- 
tables. Court bouillon may yield good fish, but will never 
yield good sauce : it is an extravagantly costly material, the 
product and result of the employment of which is in no 
proportion to its expense, except in localities where the 
litre of v;ine is bought for twopence. In England this 
court bouillon will be, if at all, i)ut little used. 

GariiDi of ilic Bomans was a celebrated jisJi sauce made 
of fish, and to be eaten ivith /z-s/^.* The recipe for its pro- 
duction used by the ancients is supposed to be lost. Pliny 
states that garum had originally for its basis the flesh of 
shrimps, which derives probability from the fact that the 
Greek name for shrimp is (jaros, the Latin (jams. It was 

' * V. Garum, cj\ Pliuy, xxxi. 3, 7 ; Void., xxxii. 11, and several loc.

526 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



afterwards composed of other fish, but it always retained 
the name which recalled its origin. Phny reports that the 
later makers of garmn macerated the ' intestines ' of fish in 
water saturated with salt, until putrefaction began to show^ 
itself ; they then added parsley and vinegar. A thick garum 
was also prepared, and said to be obtained by allow- 
ing the entrails and other parts, generally thrown away, 
to liquefy in salt. At the time of Pliny the fish termed 
scomber was said to be preferred ; of this either the gills, 
and 'intestines,' or only the blood, taken directly the fish 
left the water, were alleged to be employed. The makers 
thus were said to obtain a precious liquid, which the 
further ingredients and treatment, and the care necessary 
for its production and preservation, rendered so dear that 
eight pints of it cost from fifteen to twenty pounds sterling. 
The most esteemed garum was that from Antipolis, and 
from Dalmatia. Horace praises that from Bysance. Into 
this compound mushrooms greatly entered, and parts of 
the scomber fish. An island near Carthagena was called 
Scombraria, because here many scombers were taken. 
Here a company was established which manufactured 
garum, and this was considered the best, and called 
Garum soclorum. The word scomber has been variously 
interpreted — on the one side as mackerel, on the other as 
tunuy. The blood and entrails, i.e., probably, roe, of 
tunny fish, mixed with salt in a vase, produced also 
garum. The vessel was opened at the expiration of two 
months, and the rich garum w^as taken out. This may 
well have been a kind of caviar. A garum was also made 
from (it is alleged the livers of) anchovies, macerated 
in vinegar, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic, white wine, and 
sweet herbs. Apicius made a garum from (he alleges 
the livers of) red mullet. In old Eoman economical 
writers recipes are given for making garum from small 
fish, with much salt, stirring, standing, and addition of 



LITERArURE OF GARUM . 521 

wine ; a slow and a quick process are given ; this resulted 
probably in the production of a kind of fish essence, like 
our present anchovy cssejicc. Although fish was generally- 
used, the flesh of other animals was sometimes employed 
in the formation of garum. Garum, then, w^as a product 
from different animals, slirivijjs, scomber fish, sard'uies or 
ancliovics, red mitUet, their intestines, i.e., most probably, 
roe, also called liver, both soft and (jranular, and the flesh 
of other animals. It was probably w^hen made by one 
mode a preparation analogous to caviar ; when made of 
another, analogous to extract of meat with salt, and by a 
third to essence of anchovies. The liver garum of Apicius 
was a freak, and never had any position ; we may dismiss 
it from consideration. We have not translated the word 
scoitiber, the fish from which the best garum was made. 
We believe, with Soyer, that it could not have been the 
mackerel, as the descriptions of the process do not fit that 
fish; but we think that it was probably the tunny, as 
Stephanus reported, and as we have already stated above. 
The expression entrails, or intestines, of the fish has pro- 
bably to be interpreted as its 7-oe, soft and hard, and not as 
gut or stomach, which latter could by no means be made to 
yield an essence of a savoury kind. 

The reader may find some further discussion of this 
question in Soyer's ' Pantropheon. ' He may also there 
read the recipes for the composition of two stomachics 
into which garum entered, namely, liypotrimma and 
moretaria. Interesting, however, is the note from Bosc, 
that while at the present day garum is forgotten in Italy, 
in Turkey it is still in use. . * The innkeepers of Constanti- 
nople preserve in garum the cooked fish not consumed in 
the day.' 

Brillat-Savarin has a chapter on garum and muria, and 
comes to the entirely unfounded surmise that the Eoman 
garum had been the same as soy, which comes from India, 



522 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



resp. China, resp. Japan, and which soy, he says, was 
the result of the fermentatiou of fish with mushrooms. 
But soy is made from a bean, ^oya, and neither fish nor 
mushrooms ever come near it. (Spurious soy contains 
besides the bean extract, a quantity of molasses.) Mnria 
may be translated as brine simply, for it signified the 
mother liquor of common salt, or nitre, etc. (by Linne it 
was applied to solid salt made from salt springs not con- 
nected with the sea), but it was also a synonym of garum. 
Savarin had evidently never tasted soij, as gustation alone, 
if he had that diagnostic power, would have taught him 
that it contained no principle of either fish or fungus. 
According to Dioscorides (<?/. Matthiolus, ' Comment.,' 154:), 
garum was also used as an antiseptic to wounds, and in a 
variety of surgical applications. 

The iurhot is one of the most elegant fishes, and has 
been so highly appreciated at all historical times that it 
has become the object of anecdote. Juvenal relates that 
the Emperor Diocletian, having received a present of a 
very large turbot, consulted the Senate regarding the vessel 
in which the fish was to be cooked, and the sauce which 
was to be served with it. The senators, however, perhaps 
perceiving that they were being played with, separated with- 
out coming to a resolution. The statement by Berchoux, the 
culinary bard, in his magiric epic 'Gastronomie' attached to 
Brillat-Savarin's book, that this turbot ' had been put to the 
sauce piquante,' is probably a product of his imagination. 
Briliat- Savarin himself relates a story of which he was the 
magiric hero, and a turbot the corpus vile of experiment. 
He steamed a turbot in an old hitherto unused Vv'ash-coppcr 
(boiler) on a tray cut out of the cover of a wicker wine- 
basket, loaded with herbs, roots, rhizomes, etc. The fish 
pleased the convivants : the General Labassee smiled at 
every morsel; the cure had his neck extended, and his 
eyes fixed on the ceiling as a sign of his esctatic delight; 



PREPARATIONS OF TURBOT 523 

the academician M. Auger had brilliant eyes and a radiant 
face, Uke an author who is applauded ; and another 
academician, M. Yillemain, had his head inclined, and his 
chin turned to the west, like one who listens with attention. 
M. Lorrain, ' degustateur fortement papiUe,' also took his 
part well, and host and hostess, the latter Savarin's cousin, 
who had differed on the treatment of the fish before the 
great solution, became reconciled ; the trencher rested, and 
Savarin was happy. 

Tuvhot is more frequently plain-hoile'l than steamed. 
Vincent de Lachapelle gives a recipe for trimming and 
boiling, of which the peculiar part is the direction to cut a 
piece out of the middle of the fish, or split it open on the 
black side from head to tail, probably in order to admit the 
heat better to the thickest part. For the thinner parts are 
liable to be overdone while the thickest ones are yet under 
or just done. He also directs the cook to add a pi}it or two 
of milk to the salt water in which the fish is to be boiled ; 
the mixture is to be flavoured with lemon .lest, but the pulp, 
i.e., juice, of course is to be excluded, as it w^ould curdle the 
milk. When the mixture and fish are heated up to boiling, 
the coction is to be completed by mere simmering. The 
fish, after removal on its perforated tray, is to be trimmed 
with scissors of fins and tail, and to be garnished with 
parsley ; the trimming is batter done on the raw fish. The 
white side is kept white by being rubbed with lemon- juice 
before immersion; it should be turned upwards during 
boiling, and served in the same position on the dish. The 
sauce for turbot should always be sent to table in a separate 
boat. It maybe a wliite sauce with capers, or sauce inquante, 
as sung by Berchoux, or one made with rich coulis, or fish 
bouillon, or DntcJi sauce; others prefer oyster or tomato 
sauce. In this country lobster sauce is most commonly served 
with boiled turbot ; its place may suitably be taken by 
slirinijj sauce. Those who think much of ornamental 



524 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



garnishes may place the empty shell of the lobster on the 
white surface of the turbot, and further encumber it with 
crayfish, truffles, and silver skewers. 

Turbot may be honed in so far as its spine admits of 
removal ; it may then be stuffed, braised, sauced, crumbed, 
and baked. This is a Parisian complicated form. Turbot 
may be broiled, being scored for that purpose ; it is best cut 
in slices, at right angles to the spine, and marinaded before 
being broiled. Eub the gridiron with cJialk, unless it be 
made of silve)-, to prevent the fish being marked ; braise the 
slices in a sauce, in oven and hot closet, and send allemande 
sauce with it. Variations of this and the Parisian form are 
Turbot d la Carhne, Turbot d la Vatel, Turbot in Cream 
Sauce, gratinated ; variations with bechamel. A writer on 
this combination is so enthusiastic on this sauce and its 
combination with Parma cheese that he says : * The sauces 
really deserve that the turbot should be boiled for the 
express purpose of setting them off.' The Turbot a la Mate- 
lote Normande is a savoury stew, and flavoured with cider. 
We find in literature a great number of recipes for prepara- 
tions of turbot which have no practical application — a 
Danish Jiot iKisty of turbot, some braises, with bottles of 
chamimgne and other icines, and profusion of garnishes of 
shellfish and quenelles. There are further numerous recipes 
for the preparation of fillets of turbot, one yielding curried 
fillets, or a VIndienne ; some are half fried, half simmered, 
and accommodated with the sauce termed a la ravigote. 
Many recipes are without specificity, and mere repetitions 
of recipes for the preparation of salmon. 

Kegeree, or Kitchri, French Kadgiori, is a dish which 
comes to us from the East Indies, where several varieties of 
fish are used for its production. Kegeree of the English 
type is composed of boiled rice, chopped hard-boiled eggs, 
cooked minced fish, and some fresh butter; these are tossed 
all together in the frying-pan, flavoured with pepper, salt, 



PREPARATIONS OF BRILL AND SOLE 525 

and any minced garden herbs, such as cress, parsley, or mar- 
joram, and sent to table hot. The recipe applies to fish 
already cooked, as well as to fresh fish ; it is advisable to 
make it savoury by some strong broth or some made sauce 
('Wyvern,' I.e., p. 168). 

Brill, or hrett, or i)carl turhot, French harhuc, may be 
cooked in every variety of form applicable to turbot. When 
cooked its flesh is less firm than that of the turbot. 

The sole, black sole, Dutch tonge, is taken principally in 
the North Sea, but also in the Channel and on the Irish 
coast. A celebrated fishing-ground for sole is the so-called 
Silver Pits, a place some distance off the mouth of the 
Humber. Sole lives principally on small crabs and shell- 
fish, and will take such bait as a lug-worm ; but it is mainly 
caught in trawl-nets, which scrape the ground, and, rousing 
the fish lying on it, cause it to enter the bag-shaped net 
behind the trawling-beam. On the ability of the fisherman 
to manage his trawl depends much of the quality and flavour 
of the fish ; for, while if he sail slowly the fish is likely to 
escape the net, on the other hand, if he sail very fast the 
fish are all swept to the bag end of the net, and get 
smothered, bruised, and injured ; thus are produced the 
soles with the filled black veins (not to be confounded with 
pigmented veins) and the extravasations of blood which dis- 
colour the white meat. 

Sole does not keep long, and should be eaten as fresh as 
possible ; by being kept even on ice it loses its quality, and 
becomes flabby. The small-sized soles caught in shallow 
water on the coast are the best. The older soles are the 
greater in their size, and their weight, which reaches as 
much as seven pounds, can be judged of by the appearance 
of the scales. Those in roe should only be used for fillets, 
as their flesh is insipid or destitute of flavour. The fish 
seem to spawn, not at a fixed period, but at various periods 
of the year. The colour of the sole varies with the ground 



526 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



on which it feeds ; on a light sandy bottom it has a sandy 
colour, and is called lemon sole, and this, if not really a 
different species, is, at all events, a very inferior quality of 
sole ; on a muddy, dark bottom its upper surface is black, 
and this tint becomes its distinctive adjective. The under 
side of all soles is white. The natural history of soles, and 
of flat fish in general, offers many points of remarkable 
interest. Thus, the twist of the head takes place only 
during growth, and is not congenital ; then there are soles 
in which the twist has taken place, in a sense, the opposite 
of the usual direction. However, all these points influence 
the quality for cooking but little. The sole is trimmed by 
pulling off the dark, lemon, brown, or black coloured skin, 
cutting off the head, and with a pair of scissors clipping 
away the fins close up to the fillets, slitting open the 
abdominal cavity and removing the intestinal tract, as also 
the gills. 

For boiling, select large and thick fish, such as Torbay or 
Silver Pits, and crimp or score it before immersion in salt 
water. When it is trimmed, rub it over with lemon-juice to 
keep it white, and boil it in well-salted or sea water. If you 
desire to have it well flavoured, put into the salt-water roots, 
rhizomes, and spices ; send it to table with either butter, 
sJirimj), Dutch, or lobster sauce. 

FoT frying, the trimmed sole must be dried by being kept 
wrapped in a dry cloth for an hour. Dredge it with wheat- 
flour or oatmeal, paint it with beaten egg, and crumb it 
with perfectly dry breadcrumb or biscuit-powder. A large 
pair of soles will take the fourth part of a quartern loaf 
made into crumb so called, i.e., powder. Moist crumb spoils 
every attempt at good frying. Sole is a good object for test- 
ing the accomplishment of a cook in the matter of friture, 
the philosophy of which we have discussed in an early 
chapter. Drying, dredging, egging, crumbing, must all be 
done evenly and equally all over the fish, in default of which

the frying itself will be uneven, and therefore inartistic ; if 
the fat be not hot, tho * surprise ' will not take place, and 
the piebald, sodden fish will be an object of pity rather than 
of gustatory desire. There are a number of other pre- 
cautions to be observed in the frying of sole, which mostly 
follow out of the general rules. When the sole is fried, 
protect it from moisture, which makes it sodden, and 
thus destroys the main feature of a friture, namely, its 
crispness. 

Fried Sole admits of various kinds of secondary treat- 
ment ; it will keep good in a dry larder for several days ; it 
may be boned or filleted, and warmed in a Dutch oven 
gradually or immersed in various sauces. 

Sole ail Gratin is an excellent preparation, particularly 
with mushrooms, and depends for its taste just as much as 
a roast upon the browned outside and the concentrated 
gravy. Several variations are pleasing, such as that with 
brown Italian Sauce, or that d la Mode de Trouville, which 
latter, however, must be kept modest in the matter of onions 
and cider. Sole au Four is stuffed and baked in the oven. 
Next come the Fillets of Sole, collared, in white sciuce, with 
cai)ers ; fried ; in forcemeat au gratin ; braised ; scored and 
broiled; Normandy matelote of soles; the same with tomatoes 
a VAmericaine; d la Orhj (or Horlij), and many special 
adaptations termed after places, such as d la Venitienne, 
Provencale, Dieppoise, Boucnnaise, etc., mostly without 
specificity. Filets in aspic, as scdad, and in mayonnaise, 
are excellent cold dishes. 

Plaice, Erench plie, when quite fresh admits of some 
preparations like sole, but does not bear braising or gratin- 
ating without becoming pulpy. It is best filleted and fried, 
and requires some spice and a good sauce to become an 
agreeable fare. 

Flounder, French carrelet, is still more perishable than 
plaice. Boiled fresh it makes good soucJiets {souchies). 



528 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Ilalihut is a flat fish which attains large dimensions, and 
is sold in slices by the pound ; it may be boiled, baked, 
fried, or cooked gently in oil. Similar remarks apply to the 
s'kate, syn. maid, or ran (French raie) ; some appreciate 
the fin part, which becomes gelatinous by boiling. The 
dah (French limande) is rarely met with in England ; it 
should be treated like plaice. 

The sturgeon grows and lives a great part of its life in the 
sea — the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, 
and the Caspian. It ascends the rivers for spawning at 
certain seasons, and is then taken and used for food. From 
the Caspian it ascends the Volga ; from the Black Sea it 
travels up the Danube to near Vienna ; from the Mediter- 
ranean it visits the Provenge by the Rhone ; and here it was 
taken in such numbers in the sixteenth century that it was 
paid for only at the rate of a sous a pound. The fish is 
killed by blows on the head with heavy clubs, and subse- 
quent removal of the spinal marrow ; this is made into 
pates. The roe is preserved in salt, and becomes caviar. 

The sturgeon, German Stoehr or Hansen, the accijjenser 
of the Romans, is now a rare fish in England. It is a 
so-called royal fish, every such fish swimming in any river 
in England belonging to the Sovereign, and when taken 
having to be delivered to him ; the only exception to this 
law are sturgeons taken in the Thames, which belong to the 
Lord Mayor of London. The sturgeon attains a length of 
20 feet, and in weight may exceed 300 lb. 

Sturgeon may be broiled, after having been cut in slices 
and freed from skin and fat, which latter, when heated, 
produces a disagreeable flavour. The broiling may take 
place in an oiled paper envelope. It may be stuffed and 
roasted, larded, or spitted with strips of eel or anchovies, 
much like veal; it may be plain-hoiled, or hal'ed and braised; 
the latter form requires a previous marinading, removal of 
skin, and several flavouring herbs ; the braised form may l)e

covered with forceineat, or be glaced and garnished ; it may 
be curried, or prepared au g rat in with fine herbs ; or a muff 
0/ sturgeon {maucJio)i) maybe prepared as fricandeau, hko 
grenadins of veal. Other preparations, such as blanquettes, 
hebohs, scollops, cutlets, pates, glaces, and even a souj-), offer 
no specific features. 

Caviar. — The eggs of the sturgeon, taken from the freshly- 
caught fish, are packed in barrels after having been prepared 
in three forms. The first form remains as they leave the 
fish, without any addition ; the second form is called half 
salted, or mild ; and the third fully salted. The barrels 
hold from 15 lb. to 20 lb. each. The most important time 
for the production of caviar is the winter fishing, which 
takes place in January. Caviar is a Jiors d'ceuvre accord- 
ing to French classification of edibles* ; we have never 
heard of any preparation made from ic ; it is eaten with 
bread and butter or toast and butter, and is a great whetter 
of the appetite. It is made principally in two localities, on 
the Elbe and on the Volga. Caviar made on the latter 
river, passing under the name of caviar of Astrachan, is con- 
sidered the best. This dainty, according to A. Payen, con- 
tains in 100 parts, water, 37-50; nitrogenized substance, 
28-04 ; fat, 16-26 ; other matters free from nitrogen, 7-82 ; 
salts, 9-25. An analysis by J. Konig and 0. Brimmer gave: 
Water, 45*05 ; nitrogenized matter, 31*90 ; fat, 11-14 ; salts, 
8*91 ; of these salts 6-88 were common salt. These analyses, 
the best on record, are of doubtful value ; the amount of 
loater we may accept, but there being no distinction between 
nitrogenized albuminous and nitrogenized pliosphorized, and, 
thirdly, nitrogenized cerehrin substances^ we cannot accept 
the rubric of so-called fat either ; probably it included the 
pliospliorized matters soluble in ether. Caviar is very tasty 
when eaten spread on the top of fresh (not hot) buttered 
toast or on buttered bread. It should not be kept long

exposed to the air when once the bottle is opened. In case 
you get it in a Httle wooden barrel, subdivide it in small 
bottles, and close them with cork and bladder to exclude 
the air until the caviar be wanted. 

The salmon is said to derive its name from its habit of 
leaping over diiiiculties, particularly up w^aterfalls, when 
ascending streams for the purpose of spawning. It is con- 
sidered the most delicate of round fish, but varies in quality 
with the river in which it is taken. It may not be taken 
during the spawning season, from September 1 to February 1, 
but it is said to be in season all the year round in some 
places, e.g., in Loch Carra, Co. Kerry, Ireland. The fish is 
not called salmon before it attains the age of six years, but 
is known and sold under different names ; in the first year 
it is called smolt, in the second sprod, in the third mort, in 
the fourth fork-tail, in the fifth lialf-fisli. That caught at 
sea is the best, being fatter and more tender than river fish. 
The male is the finest-flavoured fish, and has more curd 
than the female. When it is scored perpendicularly to its 
long axis with a sharp knife, immediately after removal 
from the water, and thus put into a condition termed 
crimijed, its flesh remains more solid, and retains the curd, 
that is to say, the coagulable albumin which, after the fish 
is boiled, shows itself as milky curd. But when kept 
a few days it undergoes a change, whereby the curd dis- 
appears, the meat becomes tender and improved in taste, or, 
as some enthusiasts say, * produces oily and balsamic par- 
ticles which render it nutritious and invigorating, diuretic, 
pectoral, and restorative;' if it is partaken of too profusely 
it produces vomiting ; the crimped flesh, on the other hand, 
is hard and dry, lies heavy on the stomach, and when eaten 
to relative excess, to which its nutty taste invites, causes 
indigestion. The earliest fisJi comes to London from Ireland 
and Scotland, and is mostly sold at prices up to 10s. 
per pound. When out of season the fish has large scarlet. 



MISTORV AND PkEPARATIONS OF SALMON 531 

purple, and blue spots (bruises) on its sides ; the male has 
the snout long, the female the snout hooked. When in 
season the colour is silvery pink gray ; the flesh when 
cooked should be of a dark rose colour ; the flesh of salmon 
out of season is pale. The supply of salmon in the London 
market has altered somewhat since 1837, when the earliest, 
from the Severn, began to arrive in November ; the supply 
then rose until February, when the full season began, and 
lasted until the following October. We have seen it alleged 
that in the early decades of the present century Thames 
salmon was preferred in the London market, and some 
gastronomers pretended to be able to distinguish by taste in 
which reach of the river any given salmon was taken. But 
we doubt very much whether, after the construction of the 
more than forty locks of the river, Thames salmon ever were 
at home in it in any appreciable number. What salmon 
was taken in the Thanet was generally calvered, i.e., as it is 
now termed, crimped, as defined above, mostly while it was 
alive. Small salmon, if from 5 lb. to 10 lb. in weight, are 
termed salmon gwilts, or salmon peel. They are much 
sought after because they make handsome dishes of fish 
when sent to table doubly curved in the shape of the letter S. 
Very similar to gwilts, though, according to some, distinct 
from them, are the Berwick trout, caught in the river Tweed ; 
they are dressed exactly like the gwilt. 

Salmon is plain-hoilcd, grilled, or broiled, mostly in 
envelopes of oiled paper; crusted ivith quenelle farce, or 
skinned SLud g laced ; all these processes"^ maybe executed 
on entire fish, if of moderate size, or on sections, dams 
(French manchon = muff). Thus a darn of salmon, braised 
with aspic, is an excellent cold entree. It may be filleted, 
fried, sauced, and egged, or filleted, sliced, fried, and 
stewed ; rolled or collared as practised in Ireland. There is 

* Francatelli warns against excessive garnishing, which he quaintly terms 
'an unseemly species of medley.' 



532 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

also a preparation called a la Gdncvoisc, regarding which it 
is credibly reported that, when you order it at Geneva, 
you have to pay for a bottle of champagne and a 
bottle of claret, said to have been put into the mirepoix or 
braise in which the fish was done. This formula is never 
employed by the Genevese themselves, but only used by 
restaurateurs to give themselves an air of magnificence in 
the eyes of the stranger. The inhabitants, when they can 
make up their minds to go to the expense of two bottles of 
wine, one of champagne and one of burgundy, do so for 
the purpose of drinking it in company, and not by any 
means for putting it into a caldron of their modest kitchen. 
It is remarkable that Dumas criticises this Genevese formula 
as having the object of ' se donner par ecrit un faux air de 
magnificence,' while he gravely recites the faisan LucuUns 
of Yuillemot, which is much more absurd than this salmon 
drowned in wine. 

A Galantine of Salmon, used as a cold entree, is the 
most complicated of all preparations of this fish, and re- 
(juires a very dexterous cook for its composition. A Hot 
Pasty of Salmon is also a skilful combination. Boudin of 
Salmon is essentially a /orce?«£'rt^, consisting of salmon imiic, 
panada, eggs, and a little sauce, the whole shaped into 
balls and fried in butter. Of cold preparations the most 
frequently used are smoked incldcd salmon, fried, or the 
same in salad. Pickled salmon so called is not like the 
smoked article, also termed pickled, steeped in brine or 
salted, but merely immersed in a mixture or equal parts of 
vinegar and water, with herbs and spices. 

Smelt, French eperlan, is a small dehcate fish which 
lives in the sea, but ascends rivers to spawn, and is then 
taken. London formerly used to be supplied from the 
Medway at Rochester, where the old bridge afforded 
facihties for taking many; when the Lord Mayor of 
London made his triennial visitation of Yanlet Creek, the 



SMEL T AND SPRA TS 533 



Corporation of Eochester presented him with a dish of 
smelts ; but it is reported that at times they could be no 
longer obtained near Eochester. Large numbers come 
from Holland, but are necessarily judged to be inferior to 
the English. Smelt has roa^ the salmon fry, called smolt, 
has none ; smelt spawn in November to January, and are 
then useless, but remain in season during the other nine 
months of the year. When fresh it has a smell of violet 
and cucumber, from which its name may be derived, and 
on account of which the Germans call it foetid (stink fish) ; 
this odour disappears when they are twelve hours out of 
the water. When bought they should be stiff and firm, 
have bright eyes and 'a transparent skin. They are 
trimmed by pulhng out the gills, which bring the trail 
with them. When smelt is split and dried it is called 
sparling. A variety of sea and river smelt, the atherine, sea 
smelt, or sand smelt, is inferior to the real smelt ; it is taken 
in large numbers in the harbour of Boulogne, and for- 
warded to Paris. Smelt is fried exclusively, and not 
prepared in any other way ; dredged with flour, and 
painted with butter or oil, crumbed and egged, it is im- 
mersed in hot fat, or oil, and fried to a hght brown 
colour. 

Sprats, German Sprotten, are small fish of the size of 
anchovies and sardines, v>^hich are taken in the Baltic and 
North Sea, most conveniently and abundantly in the river 
Thames, even as high as Greenwich, in November, and for 
some time after. The tirsc dish of sprats of the season 
used to be served at the Lord Mayor's dinner on the day 
of his acceding to office. Great numbers of sprats are 
consumed by the population, the fish being very cheap, 
costing a penny a pound; the ignorant Phihstines are asked 
to pay fourpence a pound, and, of course, avoid this exces- 
sive price. Sprats are by many believed to be young 
herrings. They do not seem to differ much anatomically 



534 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

from herrings, and they appear soon after the herrings are 
gone. However, while sprats rise in brackish water, 
herrings do not follow^ them, but remain at sea ; and, 
inversely, sprats are not known to travel with the shoals of 
herrings. 

Sprats contain a large quantity of an oily fat of dis- 
agreeable flavour, and quite uneatable ; this causes all 
other preparations of sprat, except tlie broiled, to be un- 
attractive or repulsive ; hroiliiKj dissipates or volatilizes 
most of the oil, and leaves the meat eatable, and even of 
good flavour. Bouillon from sprats is very salt naturally, 
and cannot be used in a concentrated form. Smoked and 
dried sprats taste like kippered herrings. 

Whitebait is supposed to be herring fry, and is said to 
have been raised to the condition of herring in an aquarium. 
Dumas, in speaking of ' a whitebait dinner at Grennish,' 
says that this little fish was called yanchette in Italy, 
pontin at Nice, and jmisson blanc at Bordeaux. Probably 
the'^only quality which the fish of the various localities 
have in common is that they are young fish ; probably they 
do not belong to the same species in any of these places. 
If whitebait are mainly herring fry, they are at the same 
time mixed with a considerable percentage of the fry of 
other species. They are taken only in brackish water, 
floating up and down the river with the tide ; they make 
their appearance, being about an inch in length, early in 
March, and last through the early summer ; but becoming 
large, they lose their attractive tenderness and colour, and 
assume an oily flavour. Whitebait is eaten fried. 

Mackerel''' w^as probably called scomber by the Eomans, 
though the tunny was the principal bearer of that name. 
As regards the origin of the name mackerel, we have only 
a surmise by Belon, to the efi"ect that it was derived from 

* Cf. Belon,' Grsesse, Lit. Gesch., v. 993 ; cf. ^lian, 'Hist. Animal.,' 
xiv. 1 ; as to name of mackerel (macuUrelli), Kitchiner, loc. clt., p. 181, 



WHITEBAIT AND MACKEREL 535 



the Latin macularelli, little spots, the fish being marked 
with black irregular spot-like stripes on the back. The 
skin of the French mackerel is of a sea-green colour ; their 
eyes are bright and golden ; the gills are very red, and, 
when they are pulled, carry the trail with them. These 
fish generally make their appearance off the Land's End 
about the beginning of April, and as the wea.ther gets warm 
they gradually come round the coast, and generally arrive 
off Brighton about May, and continue to remain about the 
Channel until they begin to shoot their spawn. After they 
have let go their roes, they are called shotteu mackerel, and 
are not worth eating. It is in the early season, when they 
have least roe, that the flesh of these fish is in the highest 
perfection. There is also an after-season, when a few fine 
mackerel are taken (i.e., during the herring season, about 
October). These fish, after having had time to fatten and 
recover their strength, are full of high flavour, and their 
flesh is firm and juicy ; they are commonly called silver 
mackerel, from their beautiful appearance; their colour is 
almost as bright when they are boiled as it was when they 
were taken. The roe of the male fish is soft, like the brains 
of a calf ; that of the female is full of small eggs, and called 
liard roe. The latter principally, but sometimes also the 
former, is used in the garnishing of sundry dishes. 

Mackerel is frequently boiled, but many prefer it in the 
broiled state. Some French and English writers direct it 
to be served with gooseberry sauce (sauce d VAnglaise au 
groseiUes a maquereau), a mixture of equal parts of goose- 
berry puree with butter sauce or veloute. Now, although 
this sauce is termed a VAnglaise, we have never met 
with it in this country, nor, on inquiry, found a person who 
has had it made for his table, or eaten it. Its inception is 
evidently the result of the fact that the name of the fish in 
French is maquereau, and the name of the gooseberry in 
French is groseiUe a maciuereau, probably because unripe 



536 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

gooseberries were put into certain ragouts, particularly of 
fish, to heighten the taste thereof. Thus the application 
furnished a surname. {Gf. Morat et Delens, 'Diet. Mat. 
Med.,' art. Pdhes, vol. iv., p. 82.) The idea of combining 
the sauce with the fish is evidently exclusively French, and 
the sauce should pass under the name of a la Gauloise. 
Marinaded and braised mackerel can be kept for a week or 
two in the larder ready for use. Fillets of macFerel may be 
grilled in paper or fried. A recipe for steered mackerel is so' 
compHcated as to suffocate all natural flavour of the fish. 
Simpson, under a recipe entitled MacJcarel a la Maitre 
d'Hotel, directs the cook to boil macl:arel herbs, and chop 
them quite fine, but without defining their nature ; but we 
may infer from the composition of his macJcarel sauce that 
they were chopped parsley, fennel, and mint, parboiled. 

Herrings, when in season, that is, when the roe is just 
forming, are excellent and wholesome fish. They a.re 
generally of one size, because they are caught in nets of a 
certain mesh, in which they are arrested by their own act 
of erecting the dorsal fin ; but they are obtained otherwise 
of various sizes, as short as six inches and as long as four- 
teen inches, and of proportionate width and depth, weighing 
up to 4 lb. When of this exceptional size a fish is called a 
king or queen herring. You recognise them to be fresh by 
the redness of their gills and the brightness of their skins. 
The best herring for eating or preserving is the half full fish, 
or so-called matie. The earliest fisheries for herring, at the 
time of King Alfred, were on the coast of Scotland. The 
Dutch first bought the fish from the native Scotch, and 
afterwards caught it themselves. The commerce in herrings, 
according to Eidous, began about the year 1320, just after 
the Teutons had established themselves on the Baltic. The 
invention of the art of salting and barrelling herrings is 
ascribed to a Dutch fisherman, whose name is variously 
spelled as William Beuckels, or Biickiug, or Biickling, and 



HISTORY AND PRE PARA TIONS OF HERRING 537 



who died in 1449. The Dutch raised a mausoleum to his 
memory, and it is related that Charles Y. visited it in 1536. 
The trade of the Dutch in herrings taken on the coasts of 
Great Britain and Ireland in 1610 8.niounted to the value 
of more than two and a half millions sterling. 

While living the herring is green over its back, white on 
flanks and belly ; on the dead herring the back becomes 
blue. The fish ranges from high northern latitudes to 
45° lat. N. From June 25 there appear in the Dutch seas 
the herring flashes, caused by the reflection of the sunlight 
from the shoals or banks of herrings which fill the water for 
miles. A female herring may contain more than 60,000 eggs. 
There are seven females for every two males. The finest 
and best prepared bloaters (Jiarengs saiirs of the French) 
were the saurets of Germath in Ireland {Hareiir/ saur and 
sauret = s7noked licrring, homsaurer, to smoke). They were 
smoked with juniper wood. 

Herrings are now brought to market occasionally almost 
fresh. In that state they are very delicate, and may be 
prepared for the table by being boiled. Six herrings require 
two quarts of hot water and a quarter of a pound of salt ; 
boil for twenty minutes, and send Dutch or allemande sauce 
with them. 

The fat under the skin of the herring, like that of the 
sprat, is never of good taste, and should, if possible, be 
extracted. This is best done by broiling the fish, whether 
it be fresh, or salted, or smoked. Soyer (loc. cit. 143) signifi- 
cantly observes that herrings certainly could be crumbed 
and fried, but scarcely any person would like them. This 
would be perfectly true if the eater were to attempt to eat 
the crust with the meat, as he does in the case of sole or 
smelt ; but let him skin the crumbed and fried herring, and 
then pick the fillets off the skeleton, and he will find the 
flesh dehcate and pure ; the oil has been absorbed by and 
removed with the skin and the crust over it. 



538 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Herrings may receive a great number of different dress- 
ings ; they may be baked, or prepared en matelote or au 
(jratin. The preserved and salted herring (French hareng 
2Jec, i.e., pickled) is frequently eaten uncooked, like an- 
chovies, with hot green vegetables (entremets) ; when it is 
salted, smoked, and dried, it is best grilled ; when dipped 
into pyroligneous acid, and dried, it becomes I'ippered, as it 
is technically termed ; it then tastes of vinegar and smoke. 
Boned, stewed, and marinaded in the collared, rolled-up 
state, fillets of herring pass in North Germany under the 
name'of Boiler-Mops, in Lancashire and Scotland under that 
of sour herring. In Eoman Catholic districts several pre- 
parations from preserved herrings are current. 

The sardine is a small sea-fish, bearing its name from the 
Mediterranean island where it abounds. It occurs in many 
seas, abundantly on the coast of Brittany, where many 
thousands of barrels and millions of tin cases of this fish are 
annually filled. They are, like the sprats, hardly good to 
eat fresh, owing to an oil, which has to be got rid of. This 
is done by draining and pressure, and by saJting. Great 
masses of sardines are taken along the coast of Galicia and 
imported in a salted state into Spain ; then they are fried 
in oil, and we always found them excellent. Fresh sardines 
should be broiled like sprats, clamped in a gridiron. 

Sardines have scales, and thereby are distinguished from 
anchovies at first sight, the skin of which is bare. 

The anchovy, French ancJiois, German Sardelle, is a small 
sea-fish little more than five inches in length, with a 
smooth skin destitute of scales, a large head, large black 
eyes, a large swallow, a silvery body, and round back. It 
is taken during the night on the eastern coasts of Italy, 
France and Spain. The head being cut off and the trail 
removed, the washed fish is immediately stratified with 
salt in barrels. The fishermen of Proven9e used salt 
coloured with ochreous earth, which made the fish red. Both 



SARDINES, ANCHOVIES AND TUNNY 539 



ochre and colour have been transferred to our English 
essence of anchovies in the shape of Armenian bolus. The 
Provencal fishermen do not change the brine which is 
formed in the barrels, but, when its level has sunk by evapora- 
tion, fill it up. The fishermen of other parts, however, use 
colourless pure baysalt, and change the brine three times ; 
thus their anchovies do perhaps keep longer, but have less 
flavour than the more perishable anchovies of Provence. 
In seaports anchovies, after having been freed from salt 
by steeping and dipped in a suitable batter, are eaten 
either fried or roasted. Salted anchovies are best when 
new, firm, white outside, vermilion-coloured inside, and 
free from all traces of putrid smell. They are dressed as 
fillets by taking out the back-bone, and particularly the 
group of small bones and spines forming the back-fin. In 
this state they are used for a great number of culinary pre- 
parations, as a flavouring ingredient or zest of the highest 
value, and as liors cVceuvre. As most valuable preparations 
of anchovy we recall Ancliovij Butter Q^nd Anclionj Sauce; 
Fioties and Canapes of anchovies, combinations with force- 
meat, or with eggs, lettuce, etc., as salad. "When prepara- 
tions of anchovy are made too dilute by insufiiciency of 
material they lose the appetising quality, become flat, or 
taste of train-oil ; this deterioration affects essence of an- 
chovies and sauces by long standing and exposure to air. 

The tunny, Scomber tJiynnus, L. (from the Greek tJiynnos, 
from thyno, I dart or rush along ; Dutch thonym, French 
thon, German Thun), is a large-sized member of the mackerel 
family, taken mainly on the Mediterranean coasts, at Mar- 
seilles, Corsica, round Sicily, and along the x\frican shore. 
The aliment afforded by its muscle is so peculiar that it is 
said to be neither flesh nor fish. The fishermen call it 
Chartists' veal, because some parts have the taste and pale 
colour of veal, but being fish could be eaten by Carthusians. 
It is eaten fresh and salted, and the celebrated physician 



540 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Galen is said to have been the first to teach the manner in 
which it could be preserved and made fit for transport. 
Nearly all the tunny eaten in France and Switzerland comes 
from Provence, where it is caught in nets in the rivers. For 
being tinned it is cut in pieces, fried on the grill, then 
in oil ; it is then peppered and salted, placed in little 
barrels, and infused with vinegar and oil (Galen's method). 
At the present time it is more commonly preserved in tins 
by Apperts' method, without any preparation or addition. 
Current forms of preparation are obtained by roasting, 
braising, and frying. It is not rarely added in scollops to 
salads. 

Codfish was estimated highly by the Greeks, and prepared 
with grated cheese, vinegar, salt and oil. After them, history 
is silent about cod until the Northern fisheries were or- 
ganized in the ninth century ; from this time for six 
hundred years the inhabitants of Europe mostly used cod 
taken by fishermen of many nations on the coast of Norway. 
The great development of cod fisheries, and the systematic 
curing and transporting of this fish, date from the first 
third of the sixteenth century. In 1533, Francis L, King 
of France, sent J. Verrazano, and aiterwards Jacques 
Cartier, to explore the neighbourhood of Newfoundland ; 
these mariners were followed by French fishermen, who, if 
they did not discover, at least established the knowledge of 
the prodigious number of fish living in the seas of that 
island. In the first three months of the year 1792, 210 
vessels, of an aggregate capacity of 191,158 tons, left the 
ports of France to go to the various localities where codfish 
abounds ; and in the beginning of the present century more 
than 10,000 vessels of all nations were employed in this 
trade, and brought more than 40,000,000 of salted and dried 
cod to market. Since the great development which the 
fisheries on the Dogger Bauk in the North Sea have taken, 
and with the extension of the rapid transport by sea and 



HISTORY AND PREPARATIONS OF CODFISH 541 

land, many more millions of fish come to market, and a 
much greater number than formerly arrive in a living, fresh 
state. By the practice of traders to keep living, and mostly 
wounded, codfish in boxes in the harbours at Grimsby and 
other places, in a state of starvation, the flesh of the animals 
is greatly deteriorated, and becomes watery and flabby, or 
woolly. Yet the sooner cod is killed and eaten after having 
been taken the better it is in quality and taste. Cod 
generally comes into full season in October, when the 
weather is cold. From the end of January to the middle of 
March codfish are generally out of condition ; Imt, having 
shot their spawn, they resume a good condition during the 
end of March and the whole of April and May. T\\q Dogger 
Bank cod are the most esteemed, as they generally cut i\i 
large fine flakes ; the Nortli Country cod, which are caught 
off the Orkney Isles, are generally very stringy, or what is 
commonly called woolly, and sell at lower prices, but are 
caught in greater abundance than Dogger cod. The cod 
are all taken with hook, and brought in well-boats, or when 
kept, in boxes, killed in the evening, and brought to London 
or other places by night trains, expressly running for the 
transport of fish only. 

Codfish ought to be fresh and firm ; the uncoloured part of 
its skin ought to be white with yellow spots ; it ought to have 
its two-pointed chin-beard at the symphysis of the lower 
jaw. When cod is boiled there ought to be a layer of tcliitc 
curdled alhnmin between each two flakes or coherent groups 
of muscular fibres, which some call cream, others curd, 
others by other names ; when this is wanting the cod was 
poor, sick, e.g., from wounds, or starved, or kept in ice too 
long. 

Never buy the head of cod unless you have a special likiug 
for and experience regarding it, for it is very dear compared 
to its food value. Some amateurs affect to believe that the 
head of the Dogger Bauk cod has about it several tit-bits, 



542 THE SPlIUr OF COOKERY 

such as the jelly part about the jowl, the palate and the 
tongue, for the sake of which they get it baked or boiled, 
fried and stewed. Kitchiner terms such preparations 
' pretty playthings or poor finery,' and truly says that they 
will not do for those who want a good meal. 

Buy the tall onhj if you intend to fry it, but never for 
boiling ; and never leave it attached to the thick part of the 
fish, for as it is much thinner than the latter, when it is 
boiled with it, it will be overdone before the other is 
cooked ; it should therefore always be dressed separately, 
cut in fillets or slices, and be fried ; when boiled it is mostly 
soft and watery. 

The middle of the cod, vnujf {ox French manchon), is best 
for boiling, while when cut in slices, cutlets or dcirns, it 
will do equally w^ell for broiling. 

Never buy salt or dried cod if you can buy fresh ; if you 
desire to eat salt cod, pickle it yourself during a few days, 
and save the trouble of restoring qualities to the preserved 
fish by which alone it can become eatable again. Cod by 
itself has little flavour and less fat, and therefore requires 
savoury, spicy, and fatty additions. It is almost the only 
animal food of millions of human beings — e.g., the black 
slaves and labourers of xVmerica. It is sold in a great 
variety of qualities, and these should be well studied by 
consumers and their cooks. In the beginning of the last 
century cod was little esteemed by the upper classes, so 
that Simpson has no recipe at all for its preparation in any 
shape. 

The cod cured on the Dogger Bank is remarkably fine, 
and seldom more than three weeks in the cured state before 
going to market; the barrel cod is commonly cured on the 
coast of Scotland and Yorkshire. There is a great deal 
of inferior cured salt fish brought from Newfoundland and 
Iceland. 

The Dutch name for fresh cod is kabeljau, in French 



HISTORY AND PREPARATIONS OF CODFISH 543 

rendered cahiUaucl, or cabiaii. When it is salted the 
French term it moruc (from the systematic Latin name 
Gad us morrliua). Salt cod in Holland and Germany is 
called laberdau, salt and dried cod is termed lclii)pfisli. Cod 
merely dried without having been salted is termed stockfish. 
The Portuguese term the latter bakeljau ; if this be not a 
mere corruption by displacement of consonants, there may 
be a linguistic connection between stock, a stick, and hakel, 
as a derivate from the Latin baculus, a stick. 

The codfish is stated by Anderson" to have the power of 
ejecting anything indigestible he may have swallowed by 
turning his stomach inside out through his mouth, and, 
after having emptied and well washed it with sea water, to 
retract it into his belly, and be ready for another meal. 
This fable is probably the result of the observation that the 
cod's stomach is mostly found quite empty and clean, the 
result of his enormous digesting power. This has no doubt 
a great influence upon the flesh of the animal, and helps to 
keep it so healthy and clean as it is mostly found. 

Codfish plain-boiled, French cabiUaud, or morue fraiche 
d la Hollandaise (Beauv., ii. 40), is a favourite form of pre- 
paration ; many put the fish in hot water, but Kitchiner 
p. 173, directs it to be placed, and its slices also, in cold water, 
and boiled for twenty minutes ; a piece of a large fish 
requires half an hour's boiling. Take care that you always 
obtain and boil and serve with the fish a piece of the cocVs 
liver, its roe, and so-called chitterlings ; never allow these 
parts to be abstracted. The liver imparts more flavour 
than oyster sauce. Serve with brown butter and boiled 
potatoes ; in England oyster sauce is preferred. Scollops 
of cod with bechamel sauce is also a good formula. ScUt 
cod boiled must be well prepared by soaking in water, for 
from six hours to two days ; take care to use soft water, 

* Ex D.D., 715. Fresh cod, (/. 'The Cook's Cookery,' p. ll(j. If 
you can, get a cod hot out of the sea,' Kitchiner, p. 172. 



544 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

as hard will make the fish tough. Barrelled cod requires 
less soaking, but must be boiled in soft water. According 
to Count Rumford (Essay x., p. 18), 'people of fashion' 
in the seaport towns of the New England States of North 
America dined regularly on the Saturday of every week on 
salt fish ; its good quality was explained by the practice of 
keeping it for several hours in water that was just scalduvj 
hot, but was never actually made to boil. Dr. Kitchiner's 
favourite vegetable accompaniment of salt cod was a dish 
of equal parts of red beetroot and parsnips. 

When ivhitings are scarce, the fishmongers sometimes 
skin and dress young codlings, so that inexperienced persons 
can hardly tell the difference ; as the codling has a heard, 
which the whiting has not, this also is cut away, whence 
the appellation of shaved codling ; however, if you turn up 
the jowl, you may see the mark where the beard was, or 
the place where it was not, and thereby discover whether 
the fish be a ital lohiting or a shaved codling. 

Cod may be stewed, stujfed, and baked in several varia- 
tions. Fried Cod in Slices, in rice with to^natoes, called a la 
Seville, with mussel sauce, is an excellent dish. Curried 
Cod, French cahillaud a VIndienne or a la Kari, is a stewed 
form. Caheached Cod was a favourite of our friend Ignotus. 
Slices of Crimyed Cod, crumbed and fried, French cabillaud 
pane, is a quickly-prepared form. A good ragout is Matelote 
Normande. More rarely used forms are Cod stujfed, covered 
loitli egg and crumb, to which Parma cheese has been added, 
French cabillaud a I'ltalienne ; Cabillaud au Gratin, also 
with cheese. 

Preparations of salt and dried, or merely dried, cod, JdipjJ- 
fish and stockfish of the Dutch, should be studied by persons 
who travel in remote districts of Portugal and Spain, or 
in_ Africa, or in America, whether north or south of the 
equator, or who have to live in those lands ; for at periods 
they may find it to be the only animal food obtainable. 



CODt^ISH AND HADDOCK 545 



Both require soft water for soakiDg, and the merely dried 
lish must be kept iu a solution of potash (carbonate) first, and 
then for forty-eight hours in a solution of caustic i^otasli — 
i.e., Q, solution of carbonate (or beech-wood ash) m.2,diQ caustic 
with milk of lime. When again watered and cleaned, the fish 
may be parboiled — /.c'., kept in scalding water until done — but 
should never bs boiled. It requires brouii butter, or butter 
sauce, in the alternative broaii aromatic or piquajit sauce. 

Bagout of Salt CodfisJi — French brandade de morue — 
much used in Provenye and Lauguedoc, at a former period 
celebrated at Paris, derives its French name from the old 
French verb brandir, to brandish, flourish, meaning, in its 
application to our dish, to stir, agitate, or shake ; for, in 
order to attain its utmost excellence, it requires much 
patient stirring of a particular technical kind. The Bran- 
dade de Morue a la Mode de Monti)ellier is the most com- 
plete and accomplished dish of this kind, and can be served 
as releve of fish at a set dinner. The brandade can also be 
made with fresh cod, and is then de Cabillaud. 

Cods' .rounds are their sioimming bladders, the analogues 
of isinglass, the bladder of the sturgeon. Cods' sounds do 
not, on boiling, dissolve as gelatine ; they are prepared in 
various ways, and are more an object of fa.ncy than a nutri- 
tious dish. 

Haddock is the caUarias and galeris of the Uomans, 
SchellfisJi of the Germans, aigrefin or cglefin of the French. 
It has a very tine fiavour when fresh and in season, which 
is from November to January for large fish, and from 
February to May for smaller ones. Some believe a fish 
w^eighing from six to seven pounds to be the best size ; but 
such fish are rare, and still more rare are fish weighing up 
to twelve pounds. The haddocks of the Loudon retail trade 
weigh a few pounds only at the outside, and the smaller 
ones are very disadvantageous food. When in the sea 
searching for their prey, they follow the young herrings and 

35 



546 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



sprats, and when feeding on them their flesh is richer than 
when they are feeding on whitings. They must he eaten 
quite fresh or cured. When large haddocks are sold in the 
London market, they are generally called Dublin Bay, but 
in reality are mostly taken on the coast of Sussex and 
Hampshire. Haddock deteriorates even more than cod by 
being kept, so that some gastronomers declare it the poorest 
lish that swims, with neither the delicacy of the whiting 
nor the juiciness of the cod. Haddock is mostly hoiled 
'plain, or salted and hoiled, or fried, broiled, stuffed, and 
baked. Salted and dried haddock is not rarely called 
Findhorn haddock in England, from a promontory in 
Scotland where this preparation is particularly well made. 
The word is generally corrupted into Finnon, whence some 
persons derive the erroneous idea that the fish came from 
Fmland, or that the mode of preparation was Finnish. A\\ 
the best rules for preparing, dressing, curing, and cooking 
haddock are Scotch. The French think very little of 
haddock, so that D.D. and Beauvilliers have not a single 
recipe for its preparation, and do not even mention it. 

The gurnet, or (jurnard or noud — French grond in— derives 
its name from the grunting noise it makes by friction of its 
jowl-bone. The Romans call it cucidas, from the supposed 
similarity of its notes to those of this bird. There are 
several varieties of gurnet, called the gray, red, streaked, 
yellow, and sapphirine. All of them are good to eat, but 
the sapphirine is considered better than the rest, which 
collectively are called pipers. The sapphirine has a very 
long upper jaw. Its side, or pectoral, fins are on the 
outside green, and purple underneath ; its sides are red, 
its bslly is white, and its back green. The entire fish, 
when seen in a clear sea, has a beautiful appearance. 
Gurnet may be staffed and baked, or braised, boiled, sauced, 
egged, crumbed, and baked, or stuffed and boiled, or filleted 
and fried. It requires a good sauce. 



RED AND GREY MULLET. JOHN DORY 547 



The red mullet, or &ur mullet — French roiiget or initlet — 
a sea-fish characterized by a large head and a red skin, 
abundant on all Mediterranean coasts, is taken in the 
English Channel, and particularly at Plymouth. The 
Eomans valued it greatly, and observed its change of colour 
when it dies. Some modern enthusiasts termed it the 
woodcock of the sea, as its trail is eatable when suitably 
cooked. Its flesh is white, firm, short, agreeable, and 
digestible, and on the plate separates easily into flakes. In 
the sea, mullets sometimes travel in shoals underneath 
shoals of mackerel. For cooking, the fish should be only 
lightly scraped, or not scraped at all ; the gills should then 
be pulled, when part of the trail will come with them. 
This is all the eventration that is required. There is a 
variety of mullet which is reddish-brown, sometimes called 
the striijed midlet. Its flesh is firmer, but nearly as good 
as that of the perfectly red variety. The mullet prefers a 
muddy sea-bottom. It is best grilled, and it is not advisable 
to boil it ever in court bouillon. Anchovy, or Italian, or 
esjpagiiole sauce go best with it. It may be filleted, 
marinaded and fried, filleted and baked, grilled with fine 
herbs, or grilled in oiled pajjer. 

Gray mullet, grayling, and lohiting pout (the latter, in 
French, tacaud), should be prepared like red mullet. 

The John Dory — French Jaune Dore — is excellent when 
fresh. It is mostly eaten plain-boiled, with lobster or 
Dutch sauce. It may be stuffed with forcemeat, and braised 
or baked ; the stuffing should be kept fat, and slightly 
spiced with tinctures and herbs. Baste the fish, and keep 
it moist by bacon or oiled paper. Probably owing to the 
curious appearance of the fish, many fables have been 
connected with it — such as that it was the fish out of the 
mouth of which Peter took the tribute-money ; or that the 
marks on its head were impressed by St. Christopher when 
he caught one in wading through an arm of the sea. As 



548 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

the head is very large and useless as food, only fish of at 
least a foot in length, and from four to six pounds in weight, 
should be taken for cooking. 

Whiting — French meiian — is reputed to be a most delicate 
fish, and very easily digested by a human stomach : * Merlans 
manges ne pesent non plus dans I'estomac que pendus a la 
ceinture.' Moreover, it is a fish of great practic.il value, as 
it is in season all the year on different parts of the coast. 
The best size for cooking purposes is about nine inches 
long ; some rare specimens have been known to attain a 
length of twenty-four inches. Fish less than six inches in 
length may not lawfully be taken. Their flesh should be 
firm, and their eyes bright. The trimming of the whiting 
consists in skinning it, bending it in a circle, and fixing 
the tail in its mouth with the aid of a wooden peg. French 
cooks only scrape the whiting, and score or crimp it 
obliquely ; this scarifying is superfluous. Whiting is mostly 
fried^ rarely boiled; may be broiled, braised, smd finished cm 
gratin. The latter requires many additions. Gouffe demands 
for two fish of a pound in weight each — therefore 1,000 
graaames — no less than 900 grammes of mushrooms ! This 
reminds of the proverbial drowning of the miller. A 
hundred grammes of mushrooms are sufficient for the 
gratination. Whiting admits, by its neutrality, of many 
forms of preparation — it may be baked, fried, filleted, 
marinaded ; ipiesented as boudins, quenelles, oi farce. As 
the flesh basis of farces for stuffing it is particularly valuable. 

There are some rare and little-used varieties of fisli, which 
we will only name : Scad, or horse-macherel ; garfish, horn- 
fish, or tobacco'inpe fish; shipper, or saucy pike; whiting 
polloch, or glassen ; black pollock, raio pollock, or coal fish, 
and their young, called pollards ; the capeling ; the ling, 
whose name is supposed to be a corruption of long, as it 
grows up to ton feet in length ; hake, when salt called Poor 
John; forked iiake ; bass, also called sea-wolf, a species of 



RARE VARIETIES OF SEA-FISH 549 



marine perch ; conger eel, a very bony fish, of which Galen 
said that it was the hardest and most indigestible of fish ; 
the murcBna, or sea-eel, of which the Romans had a great 
opinion — on Caesar's return from Gaul, a speculator offered 
him 6,000 mursenas to be used at his triumphal banquet ; 
bream, shad, dace, weaver, sea-barbel, and thornbach. 



CHAPTER XLYIII. 

PREPARATIONS OF SWEET-WATER FISH. 

Trout (French truite, German Forelle) is the finest sweet- 
water fish. Of two varieties, one has ichite, the other rose- 
coloured flesh; the latter is called salmon trout, and is most 
esteemed ; the colour of its flesh is supposed to be derived 
from the spawn and young of the crayfish which the trout 
eat. Although trout may grow to very large size (Soyer ate 
of one, taken in the Lake of Killarney, which weighed 26 lb.), 
they occur in the market only of moderate size. Trout 
should be boiled in salt water, with a little vinegar and 
aromatic herbs, and served with boiled potatoes and browned 
butter. This is the form to which, after having tried many 
others, we always prefer to return. Cold boiled trout is 
excellent when served in a mayonnaise. When travelling 
in the Pyrenees we had this dish put before us almost daily. 
There is a recipe for Trout boiled in Wine, an echo of the 
faisan Lucullus of Vuillemot, which we advise our readers 
not to spoil their fish with ; even the ragout of mushrooms, 
the allemande sauce, and the garnishes could not restore 
the flavour of the trout drowned in and evaporated with the 
champagne or sauterne. Trout may be prepared aic gratin, 
or boiled, sauced, egged, and baked (« VAurore), or baked in 
envelopes with fine herbs, or stuffed and steioed (trnites 
farcies), ov filleted &ndi fried. 



550 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

We have just related that the ' stuffed trout ' was to have 
been boiled in wine. This recipe comes from Eeyniere, of 
' Almanach ' notoriety ; he directed that the wine in which 
the trout was boiling should he made, to take fire, probably 
as a proof of the alcohol having in the main been expelled. 
Many cookery-book compilers in succession copy this one 
from the other without seeing its purport, saying that, if 
the wine took fire, it would hniprove the sauce. None of 
these writers has ever made this sauce, simply because a 
composition such as the recipe of Eeyniere indicates does 
not, because it cannot, take fire, even if it flashed when a 
lighted match were put to it. Eeyniere recommended the 
addition of a little wine to the mixture of bouillon and vege- 
tables ; the next generation of cookery-book compilers pre- 
scribed a hottleful of cliahlis ; the latest lights with the 
c(£iiY Icger, two or three bottles full. Such a sautapan they 
no doubt could have fired, and the kitchen chimney, perhaps 
the kitchen as well. These recipes are striking instances of 
the errors of some of these writers — namely, of attempting 
to give themselves an air of magnificence by written pro- 
positions, which, when closely considered, are entirely im- 
practicable. 

Trout may be filleted, fried, and be formed into an 
* epigram,' a mysterious name from early French cookery, 
in which there was an element of symbolic mysticism. A 
good cold entree for supper is Troict tuith Montpelliev 
Butter. 

Char is taken in the lakes of Cumberland and Westmore- 
land, and is in season from July till October. When fresh 
it may be eaten as souchet ; it is brought to London as 
l^otted cliar, and, curiously enough, reported to be fresh in 
April. Char may be boiled, skinned, and glaced, and makes 
a good basis for a steived matelote. 

Lampreys have a halo of anecdote around them, which 
might fill many pages; most of these are fables, such as 



LAMPREYS AXD FABLES CONCERN ING THEM 551 

that the EoinaDS fed lampreys upon tlie dead bodies of 
slaves ; or that Pollio ordered a living slave, who had 
maliciously broken a glass vessel, ' to be thrown to the 
lampreys' (as if they were tigers); or that Henry I., King 
of England, died (1135) of a surfeit of lampreys ; and that 
other persons in subsequent centuries had a similar mis- 
fortune. The lamprey resembles the eel in shape ; it lives 
in the sea, but in spring rises into rivers ; in colour it is 
greenish yellow, with golden patches and black points ; its 
under side is paler ; it grows up to 7 lb. in weight. The 
river Severn yielded some of the best, and the town of 
Gloucester used to present annually (about New Year) a 
pasty of lampreys to the sovereign of England. Platina 
reproved the popes and great folks of Eome for their luxury 
in lampreys, which were, he said, drowned in Cyprus wine, 
with a nutmeg in the mouth and a clove in each gill-hole. 
Perhaps the wine was drunk after all, as in the case of 
salmon a la Genevoisc, and appeared only in the kitchen 
bills as the court bouillon of the fish. 

Young lampreys (in French laminillons) are much fancied. 
The fry are called in French sept-ceil, in German nine-eye, 
from the gill-holes on the neck ; some declare these fish to be 
a distinct species. They are prepared at Eouen and Barfleur 
with a mixture of butter, puree of sorrel, and fine herbs, 
and considered as a delicate hors d'oeuvre. 

The large lampreys are to this day in France prepared in 
the same manner as in the sixteenth century ; the prepara- 
tion is called It Vangevine. We conjecture that this word 
should be spelled anckevine, and thus show its relation to, 
or descent from, anchovy. The lamprey of the Thames is 
much smaller than that of the Severn, and considered to be 
a different sort ; it is called lamjocrn, and can be obtained 
from London fishmongers during the time from October 
till March. The lampreys must be parboiled in salt and 
water to discharge the muddy taste with which they are 



552 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



frequently infected ; they may then be steered, or with other 
fish worked into a matelote. 

The eel (FrenchanguiUc, German Aal) is the hero of many 
fables. The Egyptians revered it as a deity, and Athenseus 
termed it a daughter of Jupiter. It delights to live in 
muddy waters, provided it can reach the clear also. It 
may attain an enormous size, the largest specimens having 
been obtained in Scotland, Poland, and Italy. The sexes 
are not easily distinguished ; the eggs are microscopically 
small, and are hatched in the sea or in estuaries ; the fry 
ascends rivers in continuous shoals of enormous lengths. 
The eel on its back has a brownish-blue colour ; its belly is 
of silvery white when it has access to flowing water; on 
the other hand, eels of marshes or confined tanks have an 
earthy colour on the under side. Their partiality for mud is 
great, probably because they find their food in it ; this 
causes them to taste muddy— that is to say, to impart a 
flavour to the mouth which reminds of the smell of mud in 
marshes and tanks ; to free them from it, it is necessary to 
make them live for some days in clean water frequently 
renewed or aerated. 

The eel may be killed by pithing. It is generally skinned, 
for not only is the skin hard, tough, and dark-coloured, but 
there is also just underneath it an oily fat, w^hich is not of 
good taste, and not always digestible. The skin may be 
pulled off after it has been loosened at the neck by a 
circular incision, or been made to blister and become loose 
by the eel being externally grilled over a charcoal fire. The 
Jews do not eat eel, probably on account of its similarity 
to a serpent, which they formerly worshipped, as the 
Egyptians did the eel. 

There are four distinct sorts of eel — the snin, the hroail- 
noserJ, the grig, and the ^harp-nof^ed ; the latter is the kind 
generally known. The London markets are supplied with 
eels principally from Holland. 



EEL AND ITS PREPARATIONS 553 

Of preparations, eel spitchcocl-ed and grilled was once 
very popular ; for this the eel was skinnec), gutted, and 
boned, covered with spice, herbs, egged and crumbed, and 
grilled on a gridiron. The verb ' to spitchcock,' of which 
the origin is not known, does not include frying, but only 
grilling. The French cooks call spit die oching the English 
way of dressing eel. In some recipes the skin is left on the 
fish, but in others its removal is directed, as it is apt to 
offend delicate stomachs. Variations of spitchcocking are 
AnguiUe a la Broelie and a la Ste. Menehouhl. 

Owing to its freedom from spinous bones, its fine flavour, 
and its universal distribution, eel is the most popular of 
sweet- water fishes ; accordingly, it has been honoured with 
a great many modes of cooking. Steicing is perhaps the 
most frequently employed ; or it is stewed, and then crumbed 
and fried ; or it is halced in the oven ; or it may be boiled 
Z/Z/^e (French a la minute), and eaten with brown butter, Dutch 
sauce, or poivrade. Plain-frying is the most rapid process 
of preparation. The Comj^onnd Matelote of Eel deserves 
some notice, because it offers some analogy to the Bouille 
ahaisse in having caiy, eel, tench, and jjerch for ingredients ; 
but it is saturated with garlic and onions, and to be 
' moistened ' with two bottles of Narbonne wine. The 
recipe is recorded and formulated by Vuillemot, the col- 
laborator of Dumas on the Dictionary, and, like much of 
what we have seen of his cookery, is essentially coarse ; 
but it was originally suggested by that gastro-philistine 
writer, Grimod de la Eeyniere, and this makes us wonder 
how a hard-headed business man could lend himself to 
perpetrate it. It shows the same waste of wine as the 
faisan Lucullns, and this makes it impracticable on the 
one, and unsesthetical on the other, hand. Dumas, in 
wholesome fear of small bones, advised the matelote to be 
made of eel only, with s(ft and hard roe of carp. A number 
of variations of the matelote do not much alter its principal 



554 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



features. An Accolade of Eels on the Sj^it used to be put 
every Saturday upon the table of Anne of Austria, Queen of 
Louis XIII., and mother of Louis XIV. Eel boned, stuffed, 
and stewed gives an opportunity for exhibiting the quaUties 
of wliitincj for the production of forcemeat from lish. Tliis 
form may also be eaten cold in aspic ; when the slices are 
arranged in a turret-like structure the dish is ca-lled Bastion 
d'Angiu'lle. A ragout vith stewed eel and other ingredients 
makes a good pasty. 

Carp lives in rivers and ponds in South Europe. It was 
naturalized in England by Peter Marshall in 1514, in Den- 
mark by Peter Oxe in 1560, and a few years later in Sweden 
and Holland. Greek and Roman writers mention it as a 
fish of secondary quality. It is reported that very heavy 
carps were taken in the Rhone and the Oder, but these 
reports are as little substantiated as those about the carps of 
King Francis I. in the ponds of Fontainebleau. The carp is 
so proliferous that Dr. Petit could count 342,000 eggs in a 
female of eighteen inches in length ; a carp weighing 9 lb. 
contained 621,600 eggs. Of this roe of carp the Oriental 
Jews, who are forbidden to eat the caviar from sturgeon, 
make a mock caviar as a substitute for the real. Dumas 
relates that when he was at Poti, at the mouth of the river 
Rioni, he made an excursion to the Lake of Poti, which is 
eight leagues in circumference, and communicates with the 
sea. With the aid of a fisherwoman, he took many fish, 
amongst them a carp 40 11). in weight. It contained 13 lb. 
of egg-roe, and one of its scales covered entirely a five-franc 
(silver) piece. The flesh of this carp had no muddy taste, 
but was of quite pure flavour. As the carp, like the eel, 
burrows much in mud, partly for protection, partly for 
spawning, feeding, and wintering, [it acquires the peculiar 
flavour called muddy. From this it is freed l)y keeping it 
for some time, days or weeks, in running pure water, 
enclosed in boxes with perforated bottoms and sides. Some 



CARP AND ITS PREPARATIONS 555 



cooks remove the muddy flavour by drenching the carp, just 
out of the v^ater, with a glassful of vinegar. This causes it 
to burst into a violent perspiration, and in this the muddy 
taste is discharged. When you dress carp for cooking, take 
particular care to extract from the back of the head an 
angular substance called the gall-stone, French Vamer ; if 
this were not removed it would impart a bitter taste to the 
entire fish, and make it unfit for the table. Carp has for 
centuries been much reared and valued by the inhabitants 
of religious houses, so-called monks and nuns, and by great 
landed proprietors. But in late years it has much decreased 
in value or estimation. However, one of the great landed 
proprietors in Bohemia is reported to derive a great income 
from the produce of fish-ponds, in which, amongst other 
fish, carp are reared. 

Carp may be marinaded and fried, or stuffed and grilled ; 
it may be boiled blue, or in court bouillon (semi-braised) ; 
boiled icith mushrooms ; the Eussians are said to boil it in 
beer — Carpe a la Bihe, or a la Moscovite; Carpe a la Daybe 
is a complicated stuffed form, with an elaborate ragout ; 
Cari^e en Poupeton is similar (see the word poupeton in 
the vocabulary) ; carp covered ivitli or transformed into force- 
meat ; carp stewed; ditto stewed and fried, or baked; 
fillets of carp ; hashed carp ; fricandeau of carp ; larded and 
other preparations of carp and of its roes. A fanciful cook 
has endeavoured to make a dish of tongues of carp. As the 
fishes listened to St. Antony when he found his church 
empty, they should be protected from this manifestation of 
contempt for their silentious habits. 

Tench, French tanclie, German Schleie, Cyprinus tincta, 
may be prepared in many ways like carp, e.g., as matelote 
along with eel and carp, or as Carp a la Poiilctte, and 
grilled. Tench must be scraped not from tail to head, but 
from belly to back, to remove its scales. There is a marine 
tench as well as a sweet-water one. 



556 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



The Bavarian renJce, a small carp, thrives in the deep 
waters of the Bavarian Alps or Highlands, and of Tyrol. 
At Munich, e.g., it may be had twice a week from the Lake 
of Starnberg when it is in season. Egged, crumbed, and 
fried, it is as perfect as any fish on the globe. It is almost 
boneless, a feature which raises it high above other sweet- 
water fish, eels alone excepted. It varies in size from that 
of a herring to much larger dimensions, in which it weighs 
up to 41 lb. 

The ])il'e, in its younger state also called jack, French 
hroclief, German Her Jit, Esox hiciiis, is the shark of 
sweet waters ; it lives on fish, and swallows them entire. 
It is proliferous, and attains a considerable age and 
great size. Its flesh is shorter than that of cod, but is 
similarly destitute of flavour. A pike eats in six years 
252 kilograms of living fish ; taking the value of this at a 
franc per kilo, we have 252 francs, without considering 
how much this devoured fish would have increased in six 
years. Supposing a pike to weigh 10 kilos in the sixth 
year, it would cost the rearer 25 francs 2 centimes per kilo ; 
but probably it would not weigh 5 kilos in the sixth year, 
and cost more than 50 francs per kilo, while it would fetch 
in the market only 2 francs per kilo. The rearing of pike 
in closed ponds is therefore not a profitable business. In 
rivers it is destroyed as much as possible, and the size of 
pike taken over most parts of Europe has during the present 
century decreased considerably. The largest pike of which 
we have authentic record was 46 inches long and 36 lb. in 
weight. 

Pike may be boiled bine or in court bouillon ; it improves 
by being hung for a few days in cold weather ; it may be 
crimped and boiled ; or braised; roasted ; marinaded, crumbed, 
and grilled. Jack has a similar variety of recipes adapted 
to it : en fricandeau ; larded and braised with ragout ; as 
fillets and cutlets fried and grilled, etc. ; stuffed and baked ; 



PIKE, PERCM-PIKE, AND OTHER RIVER FISH 557 

studded and braised. The French cuHnary writer M. de 
Courchamps gives a recipe for a beautiful relevc (of pike) to 
be served as a large dish in tJie first service. He terms it one 
of the most expensive dishes of the modern kitchen. The 
recipe is perfectly phiHstine by the vulgarity of its plethora, 
and only fit for the rustic geld-brotz dining in a Paris 
restaurant regardless of expense ; the complicated materials 
must needs spoil either the pike or the digestion. 

Perch, German Barsch, Perca fluviatilis, is a river 
fish, but thrives also in lakes of sweet water. It is a 
voracious destroyer. It may be boiled with savoury and 
aromatic herbs, and this form goes in French culinarism by 
the comical name of a la ivatter-fish, with much variety of 
spelling, e.g., loastrefische. It may be prepared much like 
pike, but is a hard and tasteless dish. 

PercJi-jjikc, German Zander, is much esteemed in North 
and Central Germany. Some German culinary treatises 
give as many as fifteen special recipes for its preparation. 
It is best prepared like pike. 

Gudgeon, the gobio of the Romans, French goujon, German 
Grilndling, is a small fish, seldom reaching a pound in 
weight. At Paris it is a great favourite, and prepared like 
smelt. 

Eoach, German Bochc, like dace and cJiub, is a fish of 
little value as food. 

Barbel, French bar, Germa,!! Ba)be, should never be eaten, 
as it is liable to exhibit poisonous qualities. 

Gwinniad, from Welsh gwen, ivhite, German WeissfiscJi, is 
a silvery-looking small fish, almost uneatable from its many 
spinous bones. Ai Nurnberg the paste of its scales is used 
for lining the inside of hollow glass beads, whereby they are 
made to look like real ijearls. 



558 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



CHAPTER XLIX. 

PREPARATIONS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSCS, 
AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES. 

Culinary art in its application to crustaceans and molluscs 
becomes much more restricted than it is in relation to 
.higher animals used for food. Lobster is mostly ijlain- 
boiled. After this preparation its meat may receive various 
additional accommodations, such as a tomato sauce, v^hereby 
it hQQOxn.Q's, a V Americaine ; or a gratinatioii; or be formed 
into a houclin, or a cake so called, being a imte ; or it may be 
formed into quenelles, v^ith the flavour of different sauces, or 
with spinach. Tinned lobster is rather coarse, and requires 
much skill to become tasty. Potted lobster gives a chance 
to a skilful cook for producing a specialized finished pre- 
paration. 

Sea crawfisli may be prepared much like lobster. Langos- 
tinos, or Southern prawns, about fifty to the pound, should 
be treated like the following. 

Prawns and shrimps are distinguished by a very fine 
savoury taste, which makes them welcome additions to 
sauces (see Garum, supra), farces, salads, and relishes of 
bread and butter of rare effect. To learn their full value, 
acquire a pailful of prawns of the Isle of Wight, or of the 
Tagus at Lisbon, and let them be boiled at once and served 
with, say, tea. Or request the shrimpmonger to bring you a 
quart of his last boiling while they are hot. To shell them, 
hold the carapace and part of the tail of the shrimp with 
the thumb and index finger of the right hand ; with the left 
hand take hold of the last three joints of the tail, bend it 
back a little, and pull, when the shell of the tail will come 
off" at the third joint ; then lay hold of the flesh of the tail, 



LOBSTER, CRAB, CRAYFISH, OYSTERS 559 



which on pulliug will come easily out of the remainder of 
the shell. 

The so-called pGttimj of prawns and shrimps is really a 
mode of preserving them in clarified butter (ghee). Praiuuti 
go well in an omelette or in scrambled eggs. Prawns in 
French are called crevettes, shrimps clievrettes, or salicoques. 
The omelette with i^raion tails is beautifully said by Dumas 
* to coutaifi much kitchen,'' meaning that most dexterous 
cookery was involved in its production — * voici un article 
qui, je crois, contient beaucoup de cuisine.' Prawn soup a la 
Bisque is quite analogous to true bisque, described under 
Soups. In its preparation a little alcohol is not only useful, 
but necessary, to extract the colour a^nd flavour, and leave it 
with the fat. 

Crayfish, or crawfish, is a favourite with cooks for garnishes 
for mere show, on skewers surmounting or screening the 
dishes. Their main mission is to furnish that excellent 
soup called bisque. Jules Janin is reported to have jocularly 
termed the boiled lobster a iiiarine cardinal. Dumas, smell- 
ing disrespect, denies this. By extending this a little, we 
might term the crustaceans, which turn red by heat, aquatic 
cardinals; to cooks such a comparison will appear less dis- 
respectful than to some other people, as they are in the 
habit of calling many dishes, distinguished by a natural or 
artificially imparted red colour, a la cardinal. Crayfish 
has been honoured with many recipes for its preparation 
besides those of bisque. It is boiled, steived a la Bordelaise, 
a VAnglaise, en matelote — after the manner of Gascony ; on 
canapes, in aspic, etc. 

Dressed crab, hot or cold, is an old English dish, and re- 
quires much patience for its picking. Many fishmongers have 
great dexterity in its preparation, and produce a good-looking 
dish. 

Of oysters there is a great variety in the world, but none 
attain the quality of the English natives of Whitstable. 



56o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



There are oysters which may yet be cooked, although, like 
mussels, they are not very suitable for being eaten raw. 
The tinned oysters from foreign parts are of such a nature 
that cheapness alone could claim for them a place in the 
kitchen. There are many preparations into which oysters 
used to enter as flavouring accessories — oyster sauce, oyster 
soup, etc. ; but their further use is much restricted by the 
high price of the shellfish. Oysters may be scolloped, fried 
in butter and crmnb, steioed, and placed in small pates, or in 
vol-au-ve7it. There are hdtelets of oysters, being oysters 
grilled o?i skeivers, picMed oysters, oysters in JiasJi, in force- 
meat, with Parma cheese, a la Baube, and others. 

The escalop or scollop is known by its beautiful ridged 
shell, which is used not only to dress, cook and serve 
its own fish therein, but also as a vessel for many similar, 
yet as to material widely heterogeneous, preparations, such 
as are then called ' scolloped ' or colloped. The scollop is in 
season, like the oyster, from September to April, and is not 
allowed to be taken during the months from May to August 
inclusive. On the whole, the scollop is more a curiosity 
than an article of common consumption. 

The mussei, French moille, Mytilus edniis, when half 
grown and properly prepared, is an excellent article of 
food ; when full grown it is somewhat hard. It has an 
impaired reputation because some rare specimens have been 
found poisonous, even with fatal effect ; but it is probable 
that the alleged poison was as much poison to the shellfish 
as to the persons who ate the latter. Hence it is believed 
that their quality depends greatly upon the place in which 
they have lived, and their ilavour upon the objects to which 
they attach themselves by the elastic fibres of their byssus. 
Mussels are most used for sauces and garnishes, but there 
are also substantial preparations, such as Mussels in Force- 
meat (Monies a la Bordelaise). We made the acquaintance 
of this dish at Bordeaux, and have kept its memory green. 



SHELLFISH, OCTOPUS, FROG 561 



The trimmed mussel is replaced in its shell spiced, and 
covered with a savoury farce, e.g., sausage meat ; it is then 
painted with butter, over this with yolk, crumbed, again 
buttered, and baked in an oven for twenty minutes. 

Clams are a species of cockles, found only in Devonshire, 
Cornwall, part of Wales, and on the west coast of Ireland 
and Scotland. On the basaltic island of Staffa the cave 
third in size is named after this shellfish Clam Shell Cave. 
Clams, when small, may be eaten raw ; when they are larger 
they may be cooked after several of the recipes applicable 
to oysters. 

Cockles and wJielks are, like oysters, eaten raw. Peri- 
winkles, popularly called n'inkles, are small marine snails, 
and eaten as a relish with bread-and-butter. 

A great variety of molluscs in shells are considered edible 
in the cooked state in many parts of the world ; on some 
American markets such shellfish, removed from their tests, 
are sold by the gallon and bushel. Some of these edible 
molluscs are very large, e.g., the hammussel, Pinna squa- 
mosa, which is fished up from the bottom of the salt lakes 
of Meleda, one of the larger Dalmatian islands. The animal 
is eaten stewed in risotto ; it attains a length of from tw^o 
to three feet. It also yields the silky byssus, which is used 
for makiog gloves and other tissues. 

The octojnis or scjjia was eaten by Greeks and Eomans, 
and is used in the South of Spain in the present day. The 
cartilaginous plate of its back, when trimmed and stewed, 
is much like the tendrons of veal. A sauce of reduced 
espaguole, coloured deeply iciih the ink from the hag of the 
sepia, is sent to table with it. This preparation is an 
attractive, refined, and digestible dish. 

The preparation of a dish of frogs has led to the greatest 
of modern inventions, namely, galvanic electricity. Nobody 
would probably take to a frog diet, or arrange a meal of 
frogs, out of enthusiasm for this fact. But thousands living 

36 



zf,2 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



in countries where frogs are large and numerous prepare 
some excellent dishes from these amphibious animals. We 
have prepared them ourselves, and think highly of them. 
Thus, grilled on a skewer, basted with butter, or crumbed 
over, the thighs form an excellent bonne-boucJie. They may 
be dressed like sweet-water fish, fried in butter, or stewed 
in white or brown sauce. 

A Wiirtemberg nobleman suffering from dyspepsia had 
been allowed by his physician to eat a dish of frogs' thighs. 
As his symptoms returned acutely after it, he sent for 
the doctor and complained of the permission. The doctor, 
with great presence of mind, declared that what the patient 
had eaten must have been toads' thighs, and this impromptu 
terminated the incident to general satisfaction. 

The igucma is a small lizard living in the West Indies 
and Central America. It is much sought after for its fine- 
flavoured meat, and will in course of time become extinct in 
consequence. 

Preparations of turtle have been discussed under the head 
of soups. Formerly the flesh of turtle was much valued, but 
at the present time it is hardly ever eaten. 



CHAPTEE L. 

MEAT PUDDINGS, PIES, PATES-CHAUDS, RAISED PIES, 
VOL-AUVENTS, TIMBALES, CASSEROLES. 

A CHAPTER on boiled suet puddiiuis would furnish recipes 
for at least eleven j)rinciixd dislics ; but including the varia- 
tions and the compound puddings, we obtain a number 
approaching thirty, not to mention those which are only 
indicated as feasible, such as preparations to be made with 



MEAT PUDDINGS AND PIES 563 



rare kinds of birds. The principal meat puddings in par- 
ticular, and their comjjositioiis with kidneys, do not depend 
upon season, admit of accurate calculation as to cost, are 
nutritive, savoury, and eatable to the very last particle, 
without residue ; to this the bones of cutlets only form an 
exception, and these can be avoided if slices from the leg 
be taken instead of the neck and back. Sausage Pudding^ 
in particular, is a dish which can be quickly made, and 
though it requires some time for boihng the crust, the con- 
tents are more quickly, and therefore more thoroughly, done„ 
It is also certain that, while hahed vies, with the same 
ingredients, are not rarely of mediocre quality, contain 
hard meat, or show a burnt or doughy crust, boiled suet 
puddings are the least liable to any accident, and should 
therefore be prepared from time to time in every household, 
if only to maintain the practice. 

A pie is a quantity of meat or fruit baked in a dish while 
it is covered with a layer of paste which is baked along with 
it. The etyinology of the word pie is uncertain, some deriving 
it from the Irish and Gaelic name, piglie, for the same dish. 
But it is more probable that * pie ' is the older, and * pighe * 
the derived form ; we conclude this from the fact that not 
only the word, but also the dish, are peculiarly national to 
England, and interwoven with the history of its culture,"^ 

* In Jeaffreson's ' Book about the Table,' vol. ii., p. 50, is a citation 
of the work ' The Court and Kitchen of Elizabeth Cromwell,' referring to 
pear pie, made of Wardens, i.e.. Warden pears, which pie was ordinarily 
called Warden pie. On pp. 52 and 53 Jealfreson quotes Webster 
and Pegge's ' Ancient Cookery,' No. 3, in explanation of humble pie as 
derived from umhles, a metonymic of the Latin vmhiliciis, meaning the 
middle, entraiis, and other internal parts of deer. Umbles was also meta- 
morphosed into vomhids, to signify tntrails (or middle parts ?) of calves, 
swine and sheep, and of large fish : ' Nombuls of purpoys, pykes, congers, 
and great cod lyng.' The time of the origin of the metaphorical humble pie, 
and of its eating or bnng eaten, is not known ; it probably resulted from 
a pun. Frog pies were introduced into England from Italy by Thomas 
Coryate (Furcifer), and much eaten in London during the time from 
James I. to the death of Charles II. Eobert May gave a recipe for their 
production. Jeaffreson, loc. cit., ii. 57, also mentions surprise pies, which 



564 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



and that no other nation has to show anything like this. 
The French raised pies are products of special artists, and 
not popular food preparations, and they are used for the 
cooking of meat mainly, and hardly ever for the service of 
fruit. It is the universality of its applicability which makes 
pie so remarkable a form of food preparation. Of late it 
has become a practice of some circles to call fruit pies 
tarts. This should be avoided, as it is quite incorrect. In 
the true tart, the fruit is inside a ring of baked dough ; in 
the derived tart, such as it has been accepted in English 
life, the fruit is on the top of the baked dough. As regards 
meat pies, we are happy to say this erroneous nomenclature 
has not yet been attempted, and we hope it never will. 

contained living creatures, such as frogs and birds ; such pies with living 
birds came yet on the table of Charles I. —also toy-terriers, squirrels, 
hares, foxes, and mannikin pages ; thus, the dwarf Jeffrey Hudson was 
hidden in, and came out of, a surprise pie at an entertainment of the 
Duke of Buckingham's at Burleigh-on-the-Hill in 1630. A recipe for a 
so-called London pie is given in a cookery-book entitled ' Archimagirns 
Anglo-Gallicus,' ascribed by its compiler to Sir Theodore Mayerne, the 
Court physician, who, however, had no share in its production. The 
London pie contained marrow-bones (8), sparrows (18), potatoes (1 lb.), 
eringoes, lettuce stalks, chestnuts, oysters (a peck), eggs, lemcn-peel pre- 
served, artichokes, spices and currants. (Ermgoe^^ Eryn<jhim campestre, 
the fallow- thistle.) A monster fie (modern Americans would call it a 
mammoth pie) was made by Mrs. Dorothy Patterson, housekeeper to 
Sir Henry Gray at Howick (1770), which contained many birds, of which 
a list is preserved, also rabbits and neats' tongues, weighed 12 stones, and 
was moved round the dining-table on a carriage, as are joints at Simpson's 
and elsewhere. Of mince or shred pies Jeaffreson gives a history and 
recipe. Their earliest recorded examples are the veal tartlettes of the form 
of cury, consisting of veal, raisins, currants, etc., in a basis of paste, and 
covered, called coffins. The expression coffin or trajy was applied to patty 
— or pasty— cases : their contents were called sometimes tartee. Notwith- 
standing their antiquity, mince pies were objected to by the Puritans, who 
also opposed the use, at Christmas time, of plum porridge, fat pig and goose, 
and custards, for reasons which are no longer quoted. Jeaffreson discusses 
the decrease in the Jlcsh i'ngredients of mince pies, and their supposed 
ultimate disappearance ; but this was not generally the fact — their decrease 
and omission, wherever it occurred, shows a deterioration of the art of 
cooking, and a degraded deviation from the finest models of national 
tradition. The restoration of royalty after the exhaustion of the Common- 
wea'th brought with it a revival of French cookery under the literary 
guidance of Giles Rose, chief cook to Charles II. He revived marrow 
pies and bacon tarts for a short time, after which they disappeared. 



ME At PIES AND TMEIR SAVOUR 565 



The regidation of the piquancy of meat pies is one of the 
most important topics of their philosophy. Those who are 
of opinion that savoury pies, pasties, and patties are dishes 
contrived rather to excite than to satisfy the appetite will 
think little of them unless they be highly spiced and made 
piquant with zest, curry-powder, forcemeat linings, quenelles, 
gravy, fungi, wine, herbs, pickles, and spices. But this is 
not at all our idea of pie, which, on the contrary, relates to 
a substantial nutritive preparation, and, as will be seen from 
a perusal of the recipes contained in the best magiric works, 
is supported by the principles upon which nearly all are 
constructed, namely, that all those materials which have 
an insufficient a^mount of solid nutritive substance about 
them ara to be supported by the liberal addition of such 
material in another shape, e.g., beef, veal, ham, farce, eggs, 
etc. Now, it is just this combination which enables a cook 
to reach in a pie a very high degree of savour, while avoiding 
the mere piquancy of stimulating preparations. It is for 
this reason that we have insisted upon the necessity of 
limiting or toning down all flavourings derived from onions 
and their relatives ; that we have excluded wine from these 
preparations almost entirely — in short, that we have equi- 
poised their entire spicing, flavouring, and seasoning to the 
demands of polite society. 

The addition of cassareep to paddings and pies containing 
meat of quadrupeds or birds, or both, is highly to be recom- 
mended. Veal pies have not rarely an insipid taste and a 
blanched colour, disadvantages which are overcome by the 
addition of this extract and of some made gravy. With 
beef, veal, fowl, rabbit, kidneys, and their compound pies, 
the addition of cassareep effects a remarkable improvement ; 
but it must be done judiciously, not to overload the sauce 
with strong extract, and make its character too pronounced. 
The cook should study the application of cassareep by 
beginning to use it in drops, gradually rising to tea and 



s66 THU SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



table spoonfuls for large dishes. The use of this extract of 
the root of the latropha vianihot, which furnishes the 
opportunity for the West Indian speciality which we have 
described as ■pepper-pot; secondly the use of standard 
broth ; and, thirdly, the use of tinctures of spices, elevate the 
character of pies far above what one has been ordinarily 
accustomed to ; and as regards cassareej^, the effects are 
the more evident the simpler are the other ingredients of 
the dish. 

All materials of a pie, at the moment ichen they are to he 
covered luith the paste, must be cold. When the material for 
a pie has been parboiled, or fried, or roasted, or stewed 
(operations which ought always to leave the meat under- 
done), or when sauces have been made expressly to be 
placed into the pie, it is necessary to let the material 
become perfectly cold, either in the pie-dish or in a separate 
vessel, before covering it with the paste. If the latter were 
placed over the meat and sauce while they are steaming, 
the under side would condense the steam, swell up, become 
sodden, and lose the character of crust. For the same 
reason every pie-crust requires a quick heat at the beginning 
of the baking, to become set and hot, so as to drive the 
steam which rises up to it back again towards the meat. 
The omission of this and other precautions in the making 
of pies has given them a bad reputation, which, as regards 
sodden paste, is only too frequently deserved. Some writers 
say that ' putting meat or poultry into a pie was certainly 
the very worst way of cooking it,' for it was ' so often baked 
to rags.' This is true of the products of many cooks, whu 
make the oven an oubliette, to which the pie-dish is aban- 
doned, to be looked at for the first and only time when it 
is drawn forth to be sent to table. 

There are frequently put into pies hard-boiled eggs, in 
slices, or their entire yolks, or even entire p>lovers' eggs, by the 
side of the meat. This practice is indeed very common, 



MATERIALS AND INGREDIENTS OF PIES 567 



and is advised in all cookery-books, particularly as regards 
pies^ jjiulcUngs, ragoiits, and atcics. We have never found 
any advantage to pie or pudding accruing from the practice. 
Eggs communicate very little taste by their yolks, none by 
their whites. Neither do they, inversely, acquire much taste 
in the pie, and the white is generally hard, while the yolk 
not rarely crumbles. We suspect that the eggs were 
possibly introduced with a view of somewhat increasing 
the nutritive value of a dish which — e.g., pigeon pie — 
w^as, as regards the particular ingredient of pigeon, but 
small when compared to the volume. Or we may surmise 
that the eggs were introduced with the view of diversifying 
the aspect of the contents of the pie when they appear 
on the plate of the diner, and were thus intended to act 
more upon the eye than the palate. On the whole, our 
consideration terminates adversely to the introduction of 
eggs in pies, and we come to the result tliat well-selected 
quenelles of forcemeat, including such as contain a good 
deal of yolk as a binding material, are preferable to eggs or 
yolks, of whatever kind. 

We name the ingredients of the jjvincijKil ijies, which 
govern their appellation: Bumpsteah ; mutton; veal and 
liani; cJiicken and Jiaiii, simple and compound; ijigeon ivith 
beef; grouse with heef ; ijartridge with veal ; gihlet of goose 
with veal; rabbit; hare; sea irie, or compound lark pie 
— i.e., larks with veal or beef ; fieldfare or blackbird coiil- 
pound pie loitli stuffing aiid beef ; woodcock or snipe pie 
with forcemeat. 

There is a distinction brought into the foreground in 
some recipes, between forcevieat and farce, which has not 
been upheld or mentioned anywhere. Forcemeat is a com- 
position of meat mainly, with only as much of other 
ingredients as is necessary to bind it ; while farce may, but 
need not, contain any meat at all, and may consist ex- 
clusively of spiced panada with egg liaison. 



568 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Fish i^ies derive importauce from the Friday abstinence 
from meat. The most frequently used materials are eel, 
salt cod loith fish farce, and many others. 

Pates or raised pics, pics in cases, pasties, q,xq distinguished 
from the pies previously mentioned by their meat being 
contained in cases made of paste altogether, and orna- 
mented in various fanciful ways. Case and pie are there- 
fore produced independently of each other, and are united 
only for the last purpose of being sent to table. If the case 
be edible in a manner, it is certainly not generally eaten 
by those who consume the contents. Of this experience 
the potter has availed himself, and has made pie-cases of 
clay, coloured and ornamented just like those made of 
paste, and has thereby relieved cooks from a large amount of 
unquestionably useless labour. The construction of elaborate 
pie-cases of paste has been considered an art for a long 
time, but was never carried to such development as in the 
early part of the present century. We know from Careme's 
works that he was employed for long periods by Paris pate- 
makers, patissiers, to elaborate new designs for such cases, 
and much of his reputation as a cook rested upon the 
external appearance of these cases, and the effects they 
produced when seen on the table. 

The contents of raised pies are generally ragouts or fricas- 
sees of a more delicate kind, and less substantial, than the 
contents of pies of the English type ; the latter, therefore, 
lit Kitchiner's definition of pies, the former do not. The 
diminutiYes, jjetits 2^(^tes, are interesting and useful in the 
course of meals, as they can be got ready for service quickly 
by mere hotting if kept ready prepared in the larder. 

We now give the titles of some ragouts and fricassees 
which are most commonly preferred for filling pates, but 
without any reference to the outer structure or case : 

Pasty of Beef and Veal Farce [Pate a la C iho alette) ; 
Uagoiit of Cocks' Combs (d la FinancHjre), llagoiit of Giblets 



PATES OR RAISED PIES, HOT AND COLD 569 



of Goose, Turkey, etc. ; PdU of Cold Veal; PdU of Cold Veal 
and Ham ; Yorkshire or Christmas Pie. This is one of the 
most popular preparations of EngUsh cookery, and a very 
sohd basis for the proper enjoyment of Christmas festivities. 
It is really magnificent and monumental, and a colossal 
resource of the side-table. Its convenience consists in its 
compendiousness, for although the birds, and even the 
pieces of ham, have to be taken out in order to be carved, 
nevertheless, this operation is relatively easy, as they are all 
boned. But, on the other hand, the pasty is inconvenient 
by its size, because it has to be consumed by strata, which 
may prevent any choice, even such as between goose 
and turkey ; and it appears to us, further, that the mixing 
of so many dilierent flavours, even if producing a great all- 
penetrating harmony, must be destructive of the individual 
flavours, which are in our conception so agreeably associated 
with the idea of these birds of the farmyard or forest. 
However, the Yorkshire or Christmas Pie may be of all 
sizes and proportions imaginable, and in this adaptability 
to almost all human circumstances is to be found, next to 
its quality, the main cause of its great popularity. If you 
fill a raised i^ie from the capacity of a pint to that of a 
gallon with mere sausage meat and some liquid aspic, bake 
it, and let it get cold, you have a very good supper dish ; 
but if you bestow upon the forcemeat particular care, make 
it of veal and pork, add fowl or ijame, boned and sliced as 
for a galantine, you have the condition of perfection in your 
hands. Have the ingredients so mixed that the meat need 
merely be sliced to be equally distributed and require no 
selection, and take particular care to have ready, either in 
the raised pie or in a special dish, a sufficiency of savoury 
iccll-spiccd aspic jellij, the real representative of (jravy with 
all kinds of cold meat. 

liaised Cold Pasties can be made witli most of the fleshy 
materials with which hot pasties are filled ; sauces and 



570 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



ragouts remain excluded ; the sauce is replaced by aspic ; 
the solids of the ragoiit are represented hy forcemeat. Care 
must be taken not to overburden the farce with panada ; 
nor is it advisable to omit panada entirely, as it contributes 
to the lightness and elegauce of the product. Care must 
also be taken not to overspice farces and aspics, as that 
makes them distasteful to the better half and the younger 
portion of humanity. Baised pies, including such as contain 
entire birds, have this advantage over a preparation of the 
birds v^ithout a case, that they can he kept for a very long 
time without deterioration, and brought forth ready for use 
at any given moment ; they are not liable to lose much 
moisture, and cannot be invaded by the decomposing influ- 
ence of the air. In this respect raised pies are, for a limited 
time, almost as safe as tinned preparations. 

Devonshire Scpiab Pie had as essential ingredients origin- 
ally a young pigeon (squab), or young chicken (squab- 
chicken), next some kind of meat, either griskin of pork or 
mutton chops, and apples (its name, which localizes it in 
Devonshire, results from the addition of this fruit). The 
case is to be made of short paste. 

Eaised pies can be filled with ragouts of beef, rumpsteak, 
fillet, or tongue, with or without kidney, oysters, or cas- 
sareep; ragout of mutton, eventually kidneys and muslirooms ; 
ragout of pork, raised pork pie ; Leicestershire pork pie ; 
veal and ham, as mixture of slices, or ivith farce added ; 
calf's sweetbread and ham, with white sauce; fowls, turkeys, 
pigeons, and all varieties of game as described under entrees ; 
leverets, rabbits, godiveaus of any of these; snipes, quails, 
larks, ox-palates ; fish, lobster, etc. 

Petits Pates are a means of distribution of aliment which 
saves to both host and guest the trouble of carving ; they 
are, moreover, like all the little measured cakes derived 
from darioles, a convenient form in w4iich pastry can be 
offered for sale in shops ; they can be kept ready in the 



PATTIES AND BOUCHERS 571 

cold state, and be warmed up just before use, for the flake 
dough does not much deteriorate by being kept and heated, 
and the forcemeat, if it be not too dry, rather improves. 
In buying jietits ixlth ready made, take care that there be 
no flavour of questionable butter about them ; or, in making 
them, provide for the perfect sweetness of your own butter. 
The most favoured putes are stuffed with forcemeat, with 
)]ieat and gravy ^ with ichiie meat in hechamcl sauce, with 
fat livers, with salijicon, carpus roe, etc. 

When patties are made very small, so as to be a tradi- 
tional mouthfiil each, they are termed in French boachees ; 
the English word has not advanced to the dignity of a 
technical term. All the recipes for patties may be modified 
into recipes for bouchees, while dealing with the same puff 
paste and the same forcemeat ; but for bouchees the force- 
meat should be soniewhat more telling in savour than for 
patties. Take care not to fill either with flour paste instead 
of sauce; such negligence destroys the dish, while when 
properly sauced it is always attractive. 

Sometimes preparations are termed patties which may 
correspond somewhat in shape, but do not answer the rest 
of the definition. Thus, some egg and ham patties currently 
described in books are really croustades — namely, cup- 
shaped pieces of fried bread, with a luijice of hani steeped in 
broicii sauce in the cup, each being covered with a poached 
egg. This is a very elegant ancient Italian preparation, but 
should be placed with the croustades. 

Most ragoiUs and fricassees, and appertaining 6a«c'£36', which 
are placed iu raised pates, are termed entrees in the French 
kitchen ; they are given surnames mostly derived from the 
sauce, but for many surnames the fancy of some cook or 
other is the only warranty. Such should not be retained, 
but make room for descriptions derived from essential quali- 
ties. Amongst favourite ragouts for vol-au-vents are those 
of calf's brain, sweetbread, quenelles of fowl, mushrooms and 



S72 THE SPIRIT OF COOKkkY 



triLffleSj cocks' combs and kernels {a la Fluanciere), turhot 
luith bechamel, salmon 2vith ravigote, cod with bechamel and 
Parmesan, salt cod, and others. 

It is reported that Taillevant, the master cook of the 
French King Charles V., had said that to arte signified at 
one time a household loaf of bread in a round form, that 
this name was afterwards given to delicate pastry, and that 
by corruption it was called tai't in certain provinces. (We 
do not think it impossible that the French tourte might be 
derived from tourette, ' a little tower,' to the shape of which 
the French loaf of Taillevant would correspond.) The 
word tart is in Engla.nd not rarely misapplied to fruit ijies ; 
while fruit tarts should have the fruit on the top and 
within a rim of paste, to recall its evolution from the 
Roman twisted ring called torta. In Germany Tortc means 
a delicate cake of a round form, mostly wdthout fruit or 
meat, patronized by ladies at corfee-parties. The applica- 
tion of the word toartc to paste-cases of an edible nature 
containing prepared meat, ragouts, and fricassees, is there- 
fore exclusively French. It also follows that a tourte cannot 
be very different from a j;d^^ or vol-au-vent ; if difference there 
be, it is probably in the kind of dough employed for the 
construction of the case. A pasty-case was not necessarily 
edible, mostly uneatable ; a vol-au-vent case is certainly 
intended to be eaten wdth its contents ; it is always made 
of j^ajf paste. The tourte-case is made of some dough more 
delicate than the paste of the pate, and less rich than that 
of the vol-au-vent — namely, what old English cooks called 
tart paste (Simpson, loc. c'lt., p. 508), commonly called 
short imste. The name tourte seems to disappear with the 
thing in the general decadence of cookery ; neither word 
nor thing occurs in the French cookery-book of Gouffe, or in 
the German one of Rottenhofer. The latter gives, how- 
ever, twenty-eight recipes for Torten of the German kind. 
Francatelli treated vol-au-vents and tourtes as identical. 



TIMBALLS AND THEIR CONTENTS 573 

Timhnlh, or French timbales, derive their name from their 
shape, that of a drum. If this derivation had not heen 
limited, all pates, vol-au-vents, and tourtes of a cyhndrical 
shape would have come under it. These latter, however, 
go by their own specialized names, and the name of tim- 
bales is restricted to soft, edible, pudding-like cases, con- 
structed of boiled macaroni or nouilles, and filled with 
entrees, such as ragouts, fricassees, farces, or preparations 
of macaroni and nouilles, themselves partaking of the char- 
acter of entremets. Such dishes with the name of timball, 
though very old, are often omitted from so-called modern 
culinary works, or are paraphrased and made unrecognisable 
{e.g., the one taken ex Simpson, p. 101). They are, however, 
not only of great historical interest, but of considerable 
practical value, particularly for households which from any 
circumstance are temporarily restricted in the use of flesh 
food. Timballs admit of the application of much con- 
structive and ornamenting skill on the part of the cook. 
When the cases are constructed of macaroni or nouilles 
alone, the timball may be termed simple or plain ; when it 
receives a case of pastry, it may be termed compound. Of 
this latter category are timballs of macaroni and chicken, of 
nouilles and quenelles, of macaroni lined with forcemeat of 
chicken- quenelles &nd. filled loith a blanquette of fowl ; all 
these admit of interesting variations. The j;Zra"7i timballs 
are more simple in material and workmanship, but, if well 
prepared, are excellent dishes ; they are made upon the 
lines of puddings, so as not to have any liquid sauce in 
their interior, and derive their cohesion from eggs, their 
savour from meat, cheese, or fungi, and their structure 
from macaroni and nouilles. 

To the number of receptacles for prepared savoury dishes 
which it is intended to put upon the table in an attractive, 
or conspicuous, or compendious form, has of late been 
added a modification of the raised pie-case, made of rice 



374 THE SPIRIT OF COOKER\ 



paste, which, when closed, passes by the misleading name 
of casserole, when open by that of border. It is such an 
advantage for meat to be enclosed in paste that the mere 
variation of the enclosing medium requires no notice. But 
it challenges notiee when the variation results in the dete- 
tioratiotl of th§ qu^Hty of the product whif^h is yielded aa 
purchase value for the supposed improvement in the extefn^l 
appearance. The casserole an riz is a preparation which has 
had its evolution, as is evident from the following definition 
of its earliest stage : ' A piece of cooked meat may be en- 
closed in rice which has been boiled and moistened with a 
little bouillon and lard ; make a round ball of it, and bake it 
in the oven until it has a little colour.' As in all evolutions 
there are abortive segmentations, so here we have one 
effected by De Gourchamps ; a casserole of rice is described 
as an imitation (of the shape) of a pineapple, the material 
being a mixture of rice and appjles ; thus an entremets of 
rather difficult construction was proposed to take the place 
of an entree of relative simplicity. 

The merit of the casserole of rice, if it has any apart from 
the coDtents, consists exclusively in its appearance^ for it 
can hardly be eatable, and even if it was accessible to a 
broad, good-humoured appetite, is certainly not eaten, and 
on that ground alone would appear to be a very superfluous 
contrivance. It is a coarse pate-case, has not a single 
attractive feature about it, and it requires a high degree of 
imagination on the part of a cook to call it elegant. If such 
forms be wanted to serve entrees, by all means let us have 
them moulded in porcelain or clay, and burnt, and let the 
designs be really elegant ; but do not call clumsy inedible 
masses of mere rice paste of the shape of half a Stilton 
cheese artistic productions, and scrapings with bits of raw 
potatoes or turnips on its surface ornamental designs. iVfter 
this confession we need not go into details regarding the 
possible contents of such casseroles. They might, of course, 



CASSEROLES, BORDERS, AND THEIR COX7ENTS 575 

be any of the hundreds of entrees in the shape of rdrjouts, 
fricassees, purees, blanqmttes, etc., which are honoured by 
being served in x^ate-cases, vol-au-\'"ents, and tourtes ; but 
until better reason be shown for dissociating these historical 
preparations from their ancient cases, and presenting them 
in newer combinations than have hitherto been advanced, 
we advise our readers to adhere to the old recipes for the 
essential preparation of entrees, asw^ellas their outer merely 
conventional form. 

What becomes of such recipes in the hands of the modern 
abstracters of recipes can be seen by comparison. Not even 
an experienced cook could produce any presentable object 
according to the notes given in most modern cookery-books. 
The only addition to the rice made in one of these, an onion, 
is totally inappropriate, and almost ridiculous by its isolation. 
Under the remarkable heading of Ornamental Borders of 
Potato Paste some modern culinary works describe what may 
be defined as rudimentary raised pie-crusts, which ascend 
only to the height of a kind of ringwall to keep a ragoiit 
and its sauce together, and are made of potato paste. This 
word paste inserted in displacement of the usual puree 
indicates the train of thought and action wdiich led to the 
product. Although termed paste merely, the preparation 
seems intended to be edible. The term ornamental should, 
perhaps, be explained as meaning shaped to a design, or 
orname7ited (not ornaments Z), with probably such produc- 
tions of the raw potato chisel as distinguished the casserole 
mt riz. Of garnishes to be placed inside such borders the 
following are characteristic : Scollopis of Larks and Truffles ; 
Lambs' Feet loith Pascaline Sauce; Scollops of Ox-palates 
ivith Curry Sauce ; Scollops of Sheep's Tongues ivith Fine 
Herbs Sauce; Ccdf's Brain ivitli Bavigote Sauce. Wo 
abstain from discussing in detail this list of culinary curi- 
osities. It is possible that the sounding French names of 
some of these dishes deceive the writers somewhat as to 



576 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



their valiie. For ourselves we find this i^oiaio jmste to 
be the most unsatisfactory preparation of potatoes in the 
culinary calendar. 



CHAPTEE LI. 



CHARTREUSES, OR PUDDINGS OF GREEN VEGET- 
ABLES AND ROOTS, ORNAMENTAL CROUSTADES, 
TURBANS, AND MAZARINES. 

A CHARTREUSE is an elaborately constructed dish, which was 
devised for the use of, and derived its name from, the reli- 
gious brotherhood called Chartists, or Carthusians. As one 
of the compulsory rules of this order was total abstinence 
from fiesh, it is clear that the dish which bore its name, if 
it was to be used by its members, was necessarily destitute 
of meat, and of savoury extracts derived from it. In ac- 
cordance with this conclusion, Careme, in speaking of the 
grande chartreuse, which he termed ' the queen of modern 
entrees,' treated the studied absence of meat fi'om it as a 
matter of common knowledge, ' La grande chartreuse ne doit 
contenir, comme on sait, quedes legumes et des racines.' In 
this sense only has any chartreuse claim to specificity, and 
the introduction of any meat whatever causes that distinc- 
tion to be destroyed. It is therefore a curious sign of deca- 
dence in culinary literature when authors not only know no 
true chartreuses, but introduce meat into every recipe for a 
so-called specimen of that kind of dish, and even extend the 
appellation to mere cylindrical puddings of forcemeat. The 
matter is of no importance to persons whose diet is not 
regulated by influences unconnected with biological science, 
but may affect, and be worthy of the attention of, those who 



CHARTREUSES, VARIOUS FORMS sil 



observe days of abstinence from meat, or abstain from it 
altogether, as the so-called vegetarians. For these certainly 
the grande chartreuse, the most accomplished of hot vege- 
table combinations, ought to be a comforting consideration, 
and even its contemplation, preliminary to its consumption, 
ought to assist in the assertion of their propositions on 
account of its monumental aspect. 

A chartreuse can be perfect only during the months of May 
to August inclusive, inasmuch as the vegetables necessary 
for its production are only then in the desired state of growth 
and tenderness. At any other time of the year its perfec- 
tion will be opposed by the seasons, the effects of which 
cannot here be overcome by processes of preservation, so 
useful for other purposes. But of course substitutions can 
do much to make up for deficiencies, even if they imply the 
abandonment of some of the fundamental demands of the 
definition. For there are several ways of observing the fast- 
days so called, ihQ jours via'ujres of the French, the absolute 
non-compromising rule, v/hich excludes milk, eggs, broth, 
and similar derivates, and the less rigorous interpretation, 
by which these viands of animal origin are considered as 
not satisfying the definition of flesh food, and are therefore 
permitted. 

The definition of grande chartreuse by Careme was so 
stringent that it excluded even that first widening of the 
appellation by which it was made to include so-called 
entrees made with fruit, such as apples. But he allowed 
the introduction into chartreuses simply so called, which 
might be assumed to constitute a variety, for the sake of 
distinction, of parts of fish and shellfish. When thus a 
cavity was once made in the structure of the chartreuse, 
this ajppareil quickly became a raised pie, or pdte-cJiaud, the 
case of which only consisted of the legitimate green vege- 
tables and roots, while the contents were the most ordinary 
meat entrees and ragouts, such as Carthusians would neces^

578 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

sarily have excluded from their fare. At last with the 
Chartists went the chartreuse, and its name was misapplied 
to a simple pudding of incongruous parts of flesh and 
vegetables, which had none of the virtues of the Spanish 
olla, though resembling it in its larger features, and which 
was, moreover, inconvenient to deal with on the table, in 
whatever way its distribution to the diners might be at- 
tempted. Chartreuses also have received that eclectic and 
highly-mixed form which French cooks like to distinguish 
by the words a la Parisienne. A striking example of this 
is the meat entree falsely called Chartreuse d la Parisienne 
en Surprise, as given by Careme. It is throughout calculated 
to produce ' charming effects,' of course upon the eye, by 
crawfish tails. When he found that the structure * est d'un 
tres bel effet,' he no doubt thought of his original severe 
definition of the urande chartreuse, and added a surprise to 
the title in order to have in the programme the astonishment 
which it was to be foreseen the absence of all vegetables, 
except the mushrooms, must produce in the convivants. 
But he added an actual surprise, the result, we hope, of a 
lightning pain infiicted by his conscience upon his culinary 
genius, in calling this chartreuse an entree de farce. 

The predilections of the Carthusians extended from con- 
cretes to abstracts, and from pies ascended to liqueurs ; 
this was effected by a process of evolution which passed 
through an apple pudding. 

The Chartreuse of Apples begins with apple jam, which 
German and English cooks affectedly and falsely call 
apple marmelade. Then the amjelica enters as an orna- 
menting incrustation over the yellow, red, and white 
apples cemented by the jam ; the whole is to be boiled in 
a water-bath, and turned out on a plate. Here ended the 
apple chartreuse, and apples assumed their ancient rights 
and shapes. But the angelica wandered to the brandy 
bottle, and chartreuse became a spirit, the Carthusians

manufacturers of liqiteurs : * Sic transit gloria Carthusian- 
orum.' 

The com]}ound chartreuses, as they may be called, de- 
scribed in cookery-books, are more numerous than distin- 
guished ; they contain a mixture of meat with vegetables. 
All kinds of meat, fowl, fish, and vegetable may be used ; 
but we should prefer to see every such dish described under 
a proper name, and not abused as a farce on a chartreuse. 

Boudins of forcemeat, which some erroneously range 
under chartreuse, should be considered elsewhere. 

By ornamental croustades are meant such structures of 
the fried bread class as are not intended to be eaten, but 
only to contain edible preparations. Almost every kind of 
ragout, fricassee, (jarnish, or sauce in any combination so 
as to form an entree, such as are directed to be used in com- 
bination with pdtes-cliauds, vol-au-vents, casseroles of rice, 
borders of potato piaste, timballs, and any other similar case, 
can be used in connection with croustades ; but these re- 
ceptacles certainly offer no advantages whatever over the 
traditional classical cases. The very mode of making crous- 
tades seems calculated to waste a cook's time upon trum- 
peries, and draw his attention away from worthier objects. 

As to the pates-chauds correspond the diminutive petits 
pates or patties, so to the ornamental correspond the small 
croustades, in Italian called crustadini ; they may be made 
of small sections of bread, or of any of the materials of 
pastry crusts. 

Turbans and mazarines are not commonly used in France, 
so that not even their names are found in modern 
French works. They are mainly complicated preparations 
of forcemeat combined with fillets of foiols, hares, rabbits, 
fish, with fat livers, or with ox-palates, etc. They are 
mostly constructed on a basis of baked crust; over this a 
layer of forcemeat is spread, and on this the fillets, larded 
or studded in any way fancy may suggest, are placed and 



58o THE SPikJT OF COOkEkV 

agglutinated by farce, with which all intervals are filled up. 
The farce may be boiled or baked as an independent 
cylinder, or as a boiidin in a mould, and then placed upon 
the basis of the crust. To this cylinder the fillets are 
applied, and fixed with more forcemeat, or skewers, or 
string, or paper, or thin slices of bacon. When the prepara- 
tion has been built up, it is baked in the oven or steamed. 

We have seen recipes for so-called mazarines which yield 
mere forcemeat iJiiddings (or boudins), steamed in a buttered 
mould and turned out on a dish ; a cavity left or made in 
the middle of the forcemeat was to receive the ragout and 
sauce; the fillets, etc., and crayfish tails were fixed on the 
battlements of the timball as mere garnishes without any 
organic connection with it. These preparations do, there- 
fore, not essentially dift"er from the forcemeat imddings 
{entrees de farce, as Careme so well named them) described 
above. They show no specific features, are in many respects 
inconvenient inversions of the principles wbich are observed 
in the preparation of the best entrees in pates, vol-au-vents, 
timballs, etc., and do not allow of that close association of 
meat and sauce which constitutes the charm of ragouts and 
of most other entrees. We therefore judge them much 
inferior to the entrees in cases described above, and think 
that the principal culinary authors were right in omitting to 
take notice of them. 



CHAPTEE LII. 

ICES, FROZEN FRUIT JAMS AND JUICES, FROZEN 
CUSTARDS, CREAMS, PUDDINGS, AND ORNA- 
MENTAL ENTREMETS. 

The use of ice and snow in Southern countries for cooling 
drinks in hot seasons is of very high antiquity, as can be 
seen from observations made by Hippocrates and Seneca 



ICES AND FROZEN PREPARATIONS 581 



regarding the practice. In parts where these natural pro- 
ducts were not to be had, i^oro^is vessels were in use, which 
allowed a sufficient evaporation of tvater from their surface 
to keep the contents at an agreeably low temperature. 
Such vessels the Spaniards by a Moorish name call alcar- 
azas. In the sixteenth century the use of ice for the 
cooling of drink was yet so little known north of the Alps 
that the physician of Francis I., King of France, w^hen he 
attended his master at Nice during the conferences which 
he there held with the Emperor Charles Y. and Pope 
Paul III., was astonished to see that the wine was cooled 
with ice fetched from the neighbouring mountains. Ices, 
properly so called — that is to say, frozen sweet fruit juices 
and other suitable preparations — became known in France 
only towards 1660, when a Florentine confectioner of the 
name of Procope founded a coffee-house at Paris in a street 
which then bore the name of Eue de I'Ancienne Comedie ; 
there the first sweet ices were placed before the subjects of 
Louis XI Y. Since that time the use of frozen preparations 
in warm weather to cool the body, and the use of ice and 
other refrigerating agents, particularly for the preservation 
of perishable articles of food, have been extended over all 
countries. Along with this extension went improvements 
in the means of preserving, transporting, and artificially 
producing ice or other agents for the producticn of low 
degrees of temperature in water or air, so that now these 
means are very numerous and compendious, and natural 
transported ice is rivalled by artificially frozen water in 
most large towns of the world. 

The equivalent for the Saxon word ice in the French 
language is glace, and as this has received several applica- 
tions in culinary art, and even been made into a verb, and 
as several of these applications have passed into English 
nomenclature, we must define these different meanings. In 
cookery a mere jelly was called glace for a long lime; thus 



582 IHE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



we have glace de vean and glace de cuisson (called glaize 
in English) ; but the independent jellies, aspics, and sweet 
jellies were soon excluded from this terminology. A 
glace, or, as some English writers prefer to spell it, a glaze, 
became the name for a concentrated- sauce, a consommS of 
good taste, containing so much gelatine that when it was 
placed hot in a thin layer upon a piece of meat, or cake, or 
a vegetable, it adhered to it, and became set on cooling. 
Such articles covered with such thick shiny sauce were 
called glazed, whether the sauce was allowed to set or not ; 
but this kind of glazing had no relation to the application 
of artificial sources of cold, and therefore does not form 
part of the preparations to be discussed in the present 
chapter. 

In confectionery, glace is the name of the inspissated juice 
of fruit which has been preserved in such a particular 
manner that the juice will form a coat over it, which, shiny 
and adhesive at first, will become dry and crystalline in 
time ; such fruit is then called glaced ; it also is not to be 
treated of in this place. The third meaning in French con- 
fectioners' language of the word glace is that corresponding 
to the English term an ice, being a naturally sweet or arti- 
ficially-sugared liquid or semi-sohd transformed into a solid 
by artificial freezing. Such edible ice the Germans call 
Gefrorenes, or frozen matter. 

The simplest materials for ices are sioeetened fruit juices, 
such as lemonade, juice of clierries, of any of the fruit com- 
monly made into jams and jellies ; as they are limpid 
liquids in the thawed state, they are in the frozen state 
termed icater ices ; these are the most refreshing, and least 
onerous to the stomach. A cheap form of these is pre- 
pared by dissolving the so-called acid drops (really acidu- 
lated sugar-drops) in hot water, producing a sherbet, and 
then consolidating this by frost ; such water ices are sold 
to the multitude in summer time at low prices, and contri- 



COMPOUND ICES AND ICE PUDDINGS 583 



bute much to the diminution of anstival gastric derange- 
ments. The juices most commonly used for such water ices 
are those of lemons, limes, oranges, raspberries, strawberries, 
gooseberries, currants, cherries (stucet and Kentish or Vistula), 
rhubarb, yineapples, verjuice of muscatel grapes, mangos, 
apricots, peaches, greengages, mulberries. 

When any of the foregoing water ices are mixed with 
cream, for which the coloured ones are more particularly 
suitable, a new series of compounds arises, which we may 
term compound water ices. In a similar mannei", when 
any of these ices are mixed with custard ice, or cream ice and 
custard ice at the same time, compound wafer cream and 
custard ices arise, which are generally very complicated 
and rich preparations. Custard ices by themselves and 
cream ices by themselves are preferred to the compound 
ones for certain purposes. Some difficulty caused by the 
want of viscosity or sul)stance in the fruit water ices has 
been overcome by the following variation, which we may 
call fruit puree ices. Fruit purees are more easily frozen 
than juices, and therefore easier to manage in the kitchen. 
There are used purees of almonds, loalniits, filberts, pis- 
tachios, and of several varieties of fruit, which, like apricots, 
quinces, peaches, and others, form jams of agreeable con- 
sistency and appearance. When such fruit purdes are 
mixed or combined wuth custard, cream, and cakes in 
pieces, the latter soaked in dilute liqueurs or wine, or with 
macroons or ratafias, the preparation becomes a so-called 
ice piidding. 

Ice puddings are the highest complication of the several 
preparations of this class. They include as remarkable 
representatives a rice pudding transformed into an icy 
isonymic, compositions of Parisian and other cakes, of 
gauffres, macroons, and raiafias. We even see cliestnuts as 
a basis of a complex pudding, and the black bread of West- 
plialia, Puuipcrnickcl, assist in increasing by a forcible,

almost satirical, contrast the indigestibility of several of 
these ices. 

Spongadas, lastly, are mere compound cream ices, to which 
so much lohite of egg has been added that by dexterous 
manipulation the whole mixture may form a heavy froth of 
twice the original volume of the ingredients. 

The arrangement in one group of preparations which have 
mainly this feature in common, that they are cooled doion 
arfificiaUy heloic the freezing-point of u'citer, and thereby, in 
part at least, congealed so as to be hard and resistant, is a 
mere matter of convenience suggested by the materials and 
apparatus employed, and the means required to keep the 
preparations ready for use at the desired moment. Not- 
withstanding their being here massed together, frozen pre- 
parations belong to different classes of the culinary list. A 
rigid adherence to definite classification would compel us to 
range an iced or ice j^udding with puddings ; a frozen cake 
with cajxcs ; a custard with preparations of eggs and milk. 
A sweet solution of any fruit juice, called in Oriental 
language a sherbet, remains so, though it be made solid by 
frost; lemonade' xQmdAu^ so, though it be made solid under 
the name of lemon-water ice. The frozen havaroises, which 
w^e have termed compound jellies, or cream jellies, remain 
exactly the same in composition and definition whether 
they are served at the mean temperature of the earth, in 
our latitude about 52° Fahr., or at a much lower tempera- 
ture, produced by a mixture of snow or ice and salt. 

The production of these confections is a relatively simple 
process, and easy to be learned. For domestic purposes the 
apparatus required is very compendious and simple, and the 
freezing materials are of low^ price. Without describing 
ax^paratus or process, we point out some principles to be 
absolutely observed. A pailful of ice would require at least 
10 lb. of poiodered fine salt. A factor in the time required 
for the operation is motion imparted to both the freczor and 



VARIE TIES OF FROZEN PRE PARA TIONS 585 

the frcezee, if we maj^ be allowed to use these terms. The 
motion of the freezee is effected by a spatula, or by revolu- 
tion of specially-constructed pewter cylinders, one within 
the other, the inner one containing the matter to be frozen, 
the outer one the freezing mixture. In this case the com- 
pletion of the process, i.e. , the hardening of both sweet ice 
and freezing mixture, is indicated by the fact that no noise 
proceeding from the particles in shifting their places on 
rotation is heard any longer : they are all fixed. 

Cream ices are easily made, both as regards their com- 
position and their gelation. They should be used with 
caution. Less easily made, and requiring much more skill, 
are the custard ices with and without cream, for our present 
purpose mainly to be made Wi\hmilh and eggs, or milk, eggs, 
and flour. These custard ices are very valuable, as being 
easily frozen, of very good taste, very wholesome, and easy 
to digest, not overloading the stomach with fatty matter, as 
cream ices are apt to do, and fulfilling the object of the con- 
fection, that of cooling the tongue, stomach, and body, and 
affording an agreeable, yet not over-substantially nutritious, 
refreshment. Hence custard ices of this kind are equally 
acceptable to the multitude at the street booth of the 
itinerant Italian and at the best- appointed tables. 

The use of frozen 'preparations in the course of dessert has 
of late years been very much extended, and w^e think, on 
the w^hole, not w^ith advantage to the diners. In a similar 
manner, the consumption of very cold, i.e., iced drinks, 
during dinner has much increased, and gives rise to many 
quite typical digestive disturbances. While we should 
always endeavour to have Gironde and Burgundy (red) wine 
on our table at a temperature of about 65' Fahr., but water 
and white wines, particularly hock, sherry, marsala, and 
white burgundy, at 52" Fahr., we may like a small quantity 
of sweet ice at 30^ Fahr., or a little below; we would slowly 
consume a rich, hard tri-coloured Neapolitan ice according 



586 THE SPIRIT OF COOIkFJx'Y 



to the rules of ladies' company, but we should not 
favour so low-temperatured a confection as part of our 
dessert. 

We quote a few titles from our great record of tested 
recipes : Iced Custard in Shells of Parisian Cake, ivitli Com- 
Ijote of Greengages ; Iced Bice Pudding, witJi Compote of 
Oranges ; Iced Gauffre and Custard Pudding, loith Mace- 
doine ; Iced Custard and Strawberry, with Com2:)ound Mace- 
doine ; Iced Pineai)ple Puree Custard, with MacMoine in 
Water Ice ; Iced Custard with Boast Almonds, and a centre 
of Apricot or Orange Jam ; Iced Bice Custard with Iced

Iced Batafia Custard w it Ji Maraschino ; Iced Chestnut and 
Fruit Pudding (called Nesselrode) ; Walnut Purde and Green- 
gage Jam Ice ; Iced Souffles, flavoured with Liqueurs. 

Spongadas, or frozen froths, like ices in general, are 
Italian inventions. The recipes which have been given out 
are explicit enough as to the details of the ingredients, but 
they one and all fail to describe the mode incautiously 
alluded to by a single recipe, in which is introduced the 
fixed air necessary to promote its lightness, and by means of 
which its volume is increased twofold. There is therefore 
here undoubtedly a trade secret concealed, which, however 
trivial it may be (perhaps mere white of egg, or it may not 
amount to more than the addition of a tablespoonful of 
effervescent mixture of bicarbonate of soda and citric 
acid), is essential to the complete success of the opera- 
tion. 

Every frotJi is a spongada, or may be called so, in allu- 
sion to the resemblance of its structure to a sponge. We 
have the appellation in sponge-cake, but spongada is still 
more expressive, as including the idea of a thing made to 
appear like a sponge. From this point of view souffles 
may be termed spongadas, many bacaroises the same, and 



SPONGADAS AND FRf/lT ICES 587 



every preparation containino^ much wliipiw.d cream, or hemcj 
wliipped cream itself, may justly receive the same name. 

We give a few titles of recipes from our approved collec- 
tions : CJiocoIate SiJoiigada Yfith Pistachios and Ginger Com- 
fits — these and other comfits, little white or coloured sugar 
beans flavoured with specific essences, are elements of diver- 
sion, requiring crunching and evolving flavour contrasting 
to the other materials of the composition (Spongada di 
Eoma); Siwngada of Almonds and Cream (Spongada di 
Toledo), flavoured with Kirscli-wass, French abbreviation of 
Kirscliemrasser, cherry-water ; Gomponnd Spongada of Pis- 
tachio Puree with Apricot Ice ; and variations. 

Special hinds of ices are Apricot Ice, once in favour with 
Mesdames de France — one of their cooks, Cohier de Lompier, 
left a recipe for its confection ; Pineapple Ice — the recipes 
relating to this ice appear to us not very practical ; Iced 
Vanilla and Custard Cream, probably better defined as a 
cream custard loitli excess of cream; Iced Custard Cream 
with Floicers of Cedrat — all other kinds of flowers (suitable 
for confections) may be used in the same manner : ccklrat 
is the Citrus medica (Eisso), better known in the East 
than with us ; Iced Custard Cream with Pistachio Puree and 
Spinach Green — for the cream which is omitted a mixture 
of sugar syrup and white of egg is substituted. A variation 
of the spongada, omitting the cream, could not attain the 
quality of the original cream ice, and for this reason was 
complictead with JcerZ Apricot Puree. Iced Chocolate Custard 
Cream and Iced Coffee Ciistard Cream close the selection. 
The reader may compare the preparation of Dressed Cream 
and Compound Cream, called en Mousse, with the spon- 
gadas. 

Stratification of ices is an Italian diversion ; the Naples 
ices were mostly coloured white, red, and yello2L\ in layers. 
This practice may be imitated with all suitable frozen mate- 
rials. On this subject the Preceptor al des Menus Boyaux

that if by accident the stratification {2)anacJiure) could not 
be obtained by employing ices, the names of which were 
contiguous to each other in the schedule added to No. 718, 
then the stratification was to be omitted, and the ices w^ere

CHAPTEE LIII. 

PREPARATIONS OF EGGS. 

The eggs most commonly used in practical cookery are those 
of the common fowl, more rarely those of geese, clucks, or 
turkeys, and very rarely the eggs of wild birds, considered 
as luxuries, such as those of plovers. Eggs of fish are 
consumed as caviar. Many physiologists, following the 
precedent of Pay en, have an exaggerated opinion of the 
nutritive value of eggs, considered as food for the adult. 
They forget, e.g., that the pJiosjjJiorized ingredients are 
mainly materials for the construction of the brain and 
nerves of the chick, and that considered as merely meta- 
bolic materials they are of indifferent value, just as they 
are destitute of any savoury taste. The ivJiite of egg is 
almost pure, and contains only some salts and minute 
quantities of carbo-hydrate besides its albumin. The yolk, 
on the other hand, is more complicated. It contains an 
albumin - like substance which has been termed vitellin 
(17 per cent.) ; organic substances in combination with 
phosphoric acid, so called ijliosphatides (8 J per cent.) ; 
organic substances in union with a sugar, galactosides ; a 
yellow colouring matter, ovo - lutein, which gives three 
absorption bands in the blue of the spectroscope ; a con- 



INGREDIENTS AND BOILING OF EGGS 589 



siderable percentage of neutral fat, olein, and viargariii 
(21 per cent, of yolk) ; smd cJiolesteriii, nearly J per cent. 

Of fowls' eggs, ten go, on an average, to the pound of 
500 grm. ; therefore an average hen's egg weighs 50 grm. 
A goose's egg weighs from 120 to 180 grm. Of the weight 
of the fowl's egg, 7 grm, are shell, 27 grm. white, and 
16 grm. yolk ; or, in 100, shell = 11, white = 51, yolk = 
32 parts. The white of hens' eggs contains 85-75 per cent, 
of loatcr, 12-67 per cent, of dry albumin, 0-25 per cent, of 
fat and sugar, and 0'59 per cent, of salts. The yolk con- 
tains 50-82 per cent, of water, 16-23 per cent, of nitrogenized 
matter, 31*75 per cent, of olein, margarin and pliospha- 
tidcs, 0-13 per cent, of carho-liydrates, and 1-09 per cent, of 
salts. 

From the returns of the octroy of Paris, it appears that 
in 1871 every inhabitant of that town consumed 128 eggs 
per year. Later estimates give the consumption of eggs 
for Paris as 18 grm. per head per day, or 131 eggs per head 
per year. An inhabitant of Munich consumes 182 eggs per 
year, and every head in London 73 eggs per year. On the 
other hand, the inhabitants of London consume much more 
meat per head than either the inhabitants of Paris or of 
Munich. 

The principles according to which eggs are to he boiled 
are readily enunciated, but difficult to carry out. There 
are many likings as regards the degree to which eggs should 
be boiled. For purposes of definition, we acknowledge the 
following : An egg placed in boiling water for a short time 
— say not exceeding two minutes — and removed and then 
opened, will be found to have formed a thin coating of 
curdled white of egg near the shell ; the rest of the white 
is turbid or milky, but not set ; the yolk is entirely fluid, 
but warm. This is the minimum of cooking an egg should 
receive, and it may then be called very soft-boiled. When 
an egg is kept during two minutes or a httle longer in 



590 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

boiling water, and then opened, it will be found that the 
white is almost completely set, while the yolk retains a 
degree of fluidity. This some call waxy consistency, a term 
for which there is no practical explanation. This form also 
has its friends. The third form we may call solid-hoilcd. 
It requires more than three minutes' boiling, and the com- 
pletion of the process is indicated by the egg rising to the 
surface of the water, or, at all events, exhibiting a lesser 
specific gravity than at the beginning of the boiling. If the 
egg be now opened, it will be found solid throughout, but 
of equable granular consistency, and agreeable to eat. But 
if the egg be retained in the boiling water for any con- 
siderable time beyond this point— say up to ten minutes — 
a stage which we will describe as hard-hoiled, the white 
will become hard, elastic, shiny, the yolk rough, and the 
whole egg will become not only less good in taste, but also 
much less digestible ; or, to put it more definitely, its 
digestion will require more time than it would if it had 
been eaten when just boiled solid. There are culinary 
authors who prescribe that eggs to be parboiled, or boiled 
soft, should be put up in cold water, and gradually 
heated. This is probably the most difiicult proceeding 
by which to arrive at a definite result ; but everyone 
can adapt this process to his liking if he observe the 
following principles which govern the process. There 
is even a machine, called an egg-cooker, which ensures the 
cooking of eggs to the desired point. Eggs must be assumed 
to be at the average temperature of the air. Now, 
if such an egg be placed in boiling water, the effect 
produced upon it will depend upon tlie qiUDititu of the water 
and the siviftness of the production of heat underneath the 
vessel in which it is boiling. As these conditions will be 
constantly varying, and, more particularly, the eggs will be 
varying in number, no mathematical rules for boiling eggs 
can be laid down such as could be observed practically hi a 



POACHING AND FRYING OF EGGS 591 

kitchen, however accurately an egg, or any number of eggs, 
may be boiled by a strict application of these mathematical 
rules in a laboratory or on a breakfast-table. Hence it 
follows that the boiling of eggs in kitchens will mostly be 
left to the instinctive feeling of cooks, and that the practice 
which they have once acquired can never be modified, 
because it is inaccessible to argument based upon physical 
data, and therefore boiled eggs for breakfast will always, 
within certain limits, be a result of fortuity. 

Poached eggs are eggs boiled after the removal of the 
shell. The cook who wishes to display her skill in poaching, 
says Kitchiner, must endeavour to procure eggs that have 
been laid a couple of days. Those that are quite new-laid 
are so milky that, take all the care you can, your cooking 
of them will seldom procure you the praise of being a prime 
poacher ; on the other hand, you must have fresh eggs, or 
it is equally impossible. The beauty of the poached egg is 
for the yolk to be seen blushing through the white, which 
should only be just sufficiently hardened to form a trans- 
parent veil for the egg. To poach eggs, have a stewpan half 
filled with clear boiling water on the fire ; add some salt 
and a little vinegar ; break an egg into a cup, remove the 
stewpan from the fire, and gently slip the egg into the 
w^ater ; let it stand till the white be set, then put the pan 
on the fire, and as soon as the water boils take out the 
egg with a slice or straining ladle ; trim off the ragged edges 
of the white with a pair of scissors, and place it on toast 
or any other suitable basis. Or break each egg into a 
separate dariole mould, and slip one after the other into the 
stewpan containing boiHng water mixed with a tablespoocful 
of vinegar and some salt; let them boil for two minutes, 
and withdraw them in the order in which you entered 
them, or simultaneously by means of a wire basket. The 
bread to receive the poached egg should be a little larger 
than the egg, and about a quarter of an inch thick; it 



592 THE SPIRIl OF COOKERY 



should be toasted on one side only, with or without butter, 
only just of a yellow colour, never brown, which would 
make it bitter. You may flavour the toast, if desired, very 
cautiously with a few drops of vinegar, or some anchovy 
essence, or anchovy butter, or fillets of anchovies. Poached 
eggs have many opportunities in cookery ; they arq canonical 
as accompaniments to fried streaky bacon, or ham, for 
breakfast ; they are suitable for a small snatch-meal which 
a person may have to get at short notice, and agreeable 
garnishes to several entremets, such as boiled spinach with 
butter."^ 

Fried eggs are, like their boiled brethren, a dish easily 
made and easily spoiled ; in particular, to make them a 
little coloured while preventing them from becomiug hard 
and tough is difficult. They are generally fried in a flat 
pan, which causes them to spread excessively ; but there 
are special pans now obtainable which have a little well or 
excavation for each egg, so that the whites are kept together, 
and prevented from thinning out and frizzing up. In this 
apparatus eggs can also easily be baked in the oven. Fried 
eggs may be eaten with a little browned butter, and are 
much improved in taste by the addition, as mere zests, of 
acichUated gravies. Some discountenance the broiuiiing of 
the fried eggs, and we are inclined to endorse that view, 

* (Etifs jioches were made by the ' Cuisinier Imperial de 1808 ' and the 
' Cuisinier Royal de 1839,' one of many opportunities, 'pour se donner par 
ecrit un faux air de magnificence.' To make a little sauce for fifteen 
poached eggs you were to have ready cooked 'green,' or a little under- 
done, ticeh-e roas? ducks ; you were to score them down to the bone, collect 
the juice, and pour it over the eggs. 

This reminds of Brillat-Savarin's Varietes, ii., ' Phys. d. Goi\t,' p. 317, 
containing an anecdote entitled ' Les CEufs au Jus.' While on a journey, 
trying to obtain a breakfast at an inn, he got the gravy out of a leg of 
mutton, which was being roasted for other travellers, by ' giving to the 
forbidden leg a dozen deep stabs with a travelling knife,' and, getting the 
cook to steal the gravy, had liis poached eggs flavoured with it. ' While 
we were regaling ourselves we laughed like fools, because in substance we 
devoured the leg of mutton, leaving to our friends the English the trouble 
of chewing the residue.' 



BAKED EGGS, OMELETFES 593 

for the broNvning does not, as in the case of meat, produce 
any flavour. Break the eggs into the hot fat ; do not turn 
them, but while they are frying keep pouring some of the 
hot fat over them with a spoon. When the yolk just begins 
to look white, which it will in about two minutes after the 
beginning of the frying, they are sufficiently cooked ; the 
white must not lose its transparency on the convex upper 
side, but the yolk be seen blushing through it. A well-fried 
egg should look as white and delicate as a poached one. 
French cooks put some liitU sjmng onions shredded, called 
by them j^ef/^s appctiU^ into the fat in which the eggs are 
fried, and later on parsley and tarragon vinegar. It is 
said not to be advisable to fry eggs in oil ; but a typical 
French dish. Fried Eggs a la Provencale, is done in oil 
only. 

Baked eggs are done in butter previously browned — (Eufs 
ciu Beurre Noir. This dish is excellent when so made that 
the yolks are yet soft ; but when it is left in the oven until 
wanted, the eggs become solid throughout, and the character 
of the dish is lost. When the eggs on being done have to 
be kept a short time, they should be transferred to a merely 
warmed plate to arrest the access of heat from below. 
When covered with cream and pellets of butter, baked eggs 
are called by German cooks Setz-eier or Spiegel-eier ; French, 
CEufs sur le Plat, dits au Miroir. For variation, baked 
eggs may be mixed with bacon, fried, or ham, minced. 
A very dainty dish is baked eggs with braised lettuces and 
a little brown gravy. 

A dish of well-beaten eggs fried gently in butter or lard 
has received the name of omelette. It is undoubtedly of 
French origin, and in ancient works is spelled aumelette ; 
but its etymological derivation is uncertain."^ An omelette 

* Voce Omelette. Chambers' ' Etym. Diet,' defines omelette as a pan- 
cake chiefly of eggs. Its old French form is given as amelette, which, con- 
tinues the dictionary, through the form alemette is traced to alemelle, the 
old French form of French alumelle, a thin plate, a corruption (with the

594 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



is a reliable resource in the construction of any impromptu 
meal. To prepare an omelette remove the strings from the 
eggs, and add to the latter a little not exceeding a tahle- 
spoonful of water, some cream or fused butter, and beat 
the mixture. Keep the omelette thick, and to ensure this use 
a special omeleUe-jxin — that is, a small frying-pan six inches 
in diameter. Let the butter or lard be hot, and flavour 
it by frying in it a small piece of onion, which you remove 
when done. Pour the preparation on to the hot fat, keep 
it thick together, and fry quickly and carefully. The 
moment the bottom of the omelette is set, withdraw the 
pan ; do not attempt to turn the omelette, but fold up its 
sides so as to treble it, put it on its dish, place it a moment 
in the oven, garnish, and send to table. 

With good mana-gement, the whole of the white of egg 
may be incorporated with the omelette. Most modern 
recipes seem to rule so ; but some, amongst them all 
cookery-books up to 1840, prefer to omit a number up to 
half of all the whites. This prevalence of the yolks makes 
the omelette more tasty, and loose or tender ; indeed, 
Kitchiner, p. 348, thinks this suppression of a part of the 
whites so important that he says no art could prevent the 
omelette being hard if too much of the white were left 
in it. 

An omelette should not be greasy, not be burnt, not 
coloured, and not even too much done. It is one of the 
commonest mistakes of inexperienced cooks to try to make 
an omelette look like a pancake ; to prevent its burning, 
they fry it slowly, and thus make it dense, hard, and 
indigestible. The best omelette takes the least work and 

preposition a) of lamelte, diminutive of lame, Latin lamina, a thin plate. 
This definition is as erroneous as the common cook's conception of an 
omelette as a pancake. An omelette is not thin, but thick, while a pan- 
cake should be thin ; an omelette should not lie browned, while a pancake 
ought to be browned ; an omelette should not be baked on both sides, while 
a pancake ought to be made crisp on both sides. We therefore hold the 
transition from amelette to alnme.Ue disproved by the facts themselves-. 



OMELETTES, COMPOUND AND SAVOURY 595 



time. An omelette, like a custard, should just be set with- 
out being coherent ; it should be pulpy without being fluid. 
It should break before the mere spoon or fork ; if it requires 
a knife for division, it is spoiled. 

The most patronized form of omelette is that Aux Fines 
Herbes, mainly represented by parsley. Arabian Oinelette of 
Ostrich Eggs is an invention of French cooks, dating from 
the period of a visit which Napoleon III. made to Algiers. 
The ostrich eggs came from a farm. The recipe from the 
cook of the Algiers Bey can be seen in D.D., 773. All the 
fat used was oil. An ostrich egg is equal to the contents 
of ten hens' eggs. 

The number of compound omelettes which may be made 
is, of course, very great ; there are several hundreds of them 
recorded in French culinary works, being the majority of 
preparations of eggs collected in several monographs. Very 
few of them are anything but coarse mixtures, and have any 
unity or thoughtful congruity about them. 

The omelette is a mildly savoury preparation, and does 
not well amalgamate with sweet principles, except when, 
as in the case of the Omelette aux Confitures, the fruity 
sweetness acts by massive gustatory contrast. From this 
point of view, a mere sweet omelette is a preparation not 
worthy of attention, although there are formulae for such, 
and even variations — e.g., Omelette an Kirscli. Care should 
be taken that the confitures to be used with the omelette 
should be such — i.e., fine fruit jellies — and not jams or 
stewed fruit. At a private dinner in a large West End 
hotel, we saw a preparation announced as ' Omelette aux 
Confitures,' which looked like a roll of boiled wash-leather, 
and contained stewed rhubarb (leaf stalks). The host sum- 
moned the head-waiter, and informed him that if the cook 
was not ashamed to send such a dish as this, he, the waiter, 
ought at least to have been ashamed to serve it. Omelettes 
with coarse jams simulating confitures, and savoury omelettes 



596 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



with all the whites of eggs in them, are symptoms of the 
decadence of culinary art. 

The combinations of omelette are many, and may be seen 
in ordinary recipe collections ; a great number of ragouts 
can be served on a basis of omelette. Omelette, loith Parma 
Cheese is an agreeable homogeneous dish. The addition of 
oysters to omelettes is unnecessary, and not specific ; that of 
kidneys is esteemed incongruous. Of Omelette ivith Tunny 
(French omelette an tJiou), Savarin says that this dish 
should be reserved for fine dejeuners and meetings of 
amateurs, who know what they are doing. He adds a few 
notes tMoriques, which are three very commonplace rules, 
the last one being that the dish bearing the omelette should 
be warmed. 

Omelettes with fruit — as distinguished from confitures — 
e.g., strawberries or apples, contain flour in their composi- 
tion, and have, according to our definition, to be ranged 
with fritters. Several other preparations which are termed 
omelettes in collections of recipes are either souffles or 
puddings, or peculiar preparations not easily classified. 

Scrambled eggs, synonym stirred eggs, French Kufs brouilUs, 
are a kind of spoiled omelette. 

Of additions to omelettes we mention forcemeat, which 
makes them very savoury, but must be cooked independently, 
and crayfish tails. 

Some xoreparations of hard-boiled eggs should be remem- 
bered. Thus, Hard-boiled Eggs in Onion Sauce (a la Satice 
Bobert) may come in usefully; the French term the dish 
CEufs a la Tripe, which is quite unexplained. Gratinated 
Eggs form a solid and savoury dish, which may be made 
with fresh or boiled eggs. Stuffed, filled, or farcied 
eggs are an artistic dish of good appearance. The hard 
whites neatly divided serve as cups, in which the farce 
incorporated with the yolks is lodged. The dish may be 
served either hot or cold — e.g., at suppers. Baked Yolks 



MTLK, CREA.^r, AND CHEESE 597 



semi-gratinated in Sauce tuith Parma Cheese receive a dis- 
tinguished colour from the Aurora saucer a coloured bechamel, 
or from y rated yolk made ruddy by the salamander. 

We have selected from more than a hundred French 
recipes for preparations of eggs lohicli may he useful for 
Lenten fare, or for days of maigre, about forty somewhat 
curious dishes ; they are mostly obsolete or of rare execu- 
tion even in France, and of no applicability in this country. 
We therefore abstain from giving even their definitions in 
detail. Some are omelettes with ragouts over them ; others 
are omelettes with additions in their substance ; some are 
siveet dishes by additions, e.g., of macroons or ratafias. The 
great omelette will survive all these trials. 



GHAPTEE LIV. 

PREPARATIONS OF MILK AND CHEESE. 

It is believed that the cream and milk industry of Devon- 
shire is of Phoenician origin, and connected with the 
potteries developed in that county by these ancient 
mariners and colonists. The Syrian earthenware pans on 
brick hearths, which were formerly essential for the produc- 
tion of the clotted cream, have only lately been supplanted 
by metal pans. The best Devonshire clotted cream, which 
is of a yellow colour, from the distribution of small drops 
of yellow oiled butter, is in our time yielded by milk 
from Jersey shorthorn cows. Strain new milk into a large 
pan, and let it remain unmoved for twenty-four hours ; then 
place the pan over a slow fire, and heat it up very slowly 
without ever allowing it to reach or even come near to the 
boiling-point. Under these conditions the cream forms a 
thick membranous mass at the top, the fat-globules being 
enveloped in membranes of caseine, which are constantly 



598 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



formed on the surface under the influence of the oxygen of 
the air. To prevent boiling, the pan may be put into a water- 
bath ; if heated on the hearth, which takes several hours, the 
point at which the heat of the milk approaches the boiling 
temperature will be indicated by the rising of bubbles ; 
then the pan must be removed from the fire and placed in the 
dairy for twenty-four hours, after which the clotted cream 
may be taken off. It may be transformed into so-called 
Devonshire short butter by stirring. 

Yourt or yaourt, Greek cjiayourti, is a preparation of 
milk made by Levantine nations, and corresponds to the 
English curds and whey ; but while the latter is produced 
by means of rennet, yourt is produced by a j^eculiar ferment, 
the nature of which is not known. The first yourt may be 
produced by warming a basin of milk to blood-heat, im- 
mersing in it a portion of the inner or woolly part (the 
composite flowers) of the artichohe, and letting it stand in a 
warm place. After twelve hours the milk will be found 
transformed into a remarkable curd of excellent taste ; if 
the milk was good no whey is separated, but if it be broken 
into and allowed to stand whey separates. To avoid the 
sepaji'ation of whey, Greek cooks concentrate the milk before 
setting it for yourt, Now, if of this curd a little be placed 
in new warm milk, and if this be kept in a warm corner, it 
will transform this milk again into yourt, and thus you may 
produce and keep yourt throughout the seasoii. The pro- 
duction of this curd by the inner flowers of the artichoke 
was known to the ancient Greeks, and we have produced 
the dish after a notice contained in the works of Aristotle. 

Curds and whey belongs to a more rustic mode of life, and 
is now little patronii^ed by the urban populations. In order 
to separate the caseine and fat from milk for the production 
of cheese, an extract by warm water from the inner stomach 
of the calf (rennet) is added to the warm milk. (The name 
rennet is applied both to the dried membrane of the stoniach 



CURDS AND WHEV 599 



itself and to the active watery extract.) The extract of 
three-quarters of a square inch of rennet skin will curdle 
four pints of milk. 

Curds and whey may be eaten together, or the curds may 
be separated from the whey by a strainer, though without 
pressure, and mixed with creaiu, to which sugar and some 
2ui)ie or liqueur have been added. Or the curds may be 
strained off and pressed lightly, and placed and shaped in a 
mould ; in that shape they are called green cheese, a name 
which the London cheesemongers, and after them the 
populace, have corrupted into cream cheese. The brick- 
shaped white cheeses, bedded on parallel straws, sold under 
that seductive name in London (in Italy called ricotta), are 
mostly made of skim milk, sometimes of fresh milk, never 
of cream. 

The u'heij strained from curds is eagerly drunk by pigs ; 
it is also a wholesome diuretic and nutritive, easily-di- 
gestible food for man, owing to the dissolved albuminous 
substance, the sugar of milk, or lactose, and the salts, A 
ivhey cure in the Alps is a highly salutary proceeding in 
many cases of chronic illness. 

Gallina curds and icheij is a classical Enghsh prepara- 
tion,^ for which the feruient is derived from the tough 
coat that lines the inside of the proventriculus, or small 
(fore) stomach, situated between the crop and gizzard of 
turkeys and fowls. This ferment is always obtainable, 
while calf's rennet is difficult of access. Care should be taken 
not to infuse it with boiling water, as some recipes ignor- 
antly advise, but only with warm water at blood-heat or 
100' Fahr. Very hot water destroys the ferment. Gallina 
curds and w^hey, says our instructor, when sweetened 
with sugar, makes a wholesome supper for persons 
of delicate habits, being entirely free from the disagree- 
able flavour of rennet.

6oo THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Sour milk, bonny clobber, German Sclilipper-inilch, is 
formed when milk is allowed to stand in a cool place ; some 
cream collects on the top, and a membrane of dehcate/zi?if/i, 
a so-called mycelium, forms on the surface. The milk then 
assumes an acidulous taste, sometimes also is a little effer- 
vescent, and curdles in the same manner, apparently, as by 
rennet ; in reality, however, the curdling is caused by lactic 
acid, developed from the sugar of milk by a living ferment, 
a low fungus, termed the bacillus (httle rod) of sour milk. 
The curdUng by rennet, on the other hand, is effected by a 
non-organized soluble ferment without the production of any 
acid. While in the whey produced by rennet an albu- 
minous substance remains in solution {lacto-protein), and 
can be precipitated by fermented or sour whey— that is, 
whey the sugar of milk of which has been transformed into 
lactic acid ; this precipitated lacto-protein is the material 
from which the Alpine cheese-makers produce the small 
hard cheeses called lierb-cheese (Kiriuter-kcise and Ziegcr) — 
in sour milk this lacto-protein falls together with the caseine, 
and for this reason curds as well as cheese from sour milk 
have properties which differ somewhat from those of the 
curds and cheese produced from sweet milk by rennet. 
When milk is effervescent as well as acidulous, the yeast 
plant is present, besides the lactic acid plant, and produces 
some alcohol and carbonic acid, also from sugar of milk. 
This double fermentation is produced regularly in mare's 
milk, in the Kirghese steppes, and results in the production 
of koumiss. 

Sour milk is an agreeable, easily digestible, nutritious 
preparation ; it should be well stirred before use, and if not 
very rich receive an addition of cream ; its taste is heightened 
by some sugar and cinnamon powder ; grated breadcrumb, 
or dice of bread, may be added to give it body. In countries 
where the people during summer eat much sour milk for 
supper with hot potatoes or bread, cariation is produced by 



SOUR MILK, KUMYS 6oi 



the addition to the milk of hcer or cider {apple wine), or some 
ivhiskij or nun. These additions are essentially wholesome. 
The art of taking milk from mares of the steppe, and 
transforming it into an intoxicating and at the same time 
nutritious beverage is very old, as we see from the second 
chapter of the fourth book of Herodotus, where it is fully 
described. (On this subject the reader should compare the 
tenth paragraph of the first chapter, supra, Illustration 
derived from the Case of Kuinys.) It is practised as largely 
as ever, and in our days has been applied to the treatment 
of the sick, particularly of consumptive persons, with the 
result of giving them much comfort and prolonging their 
lives. This is in part due to the fact that mare's milk 
greatly resembles human milk in this, that it contains 
much less albuminous matter and fat, and more sugar of 
milk, than cow's milk. The following comparison of the 
milk of the she-ass with that of the mare, cow, and lastly 
with human milk, is instructive in all respects :

Mare's milk is very suitable for the application here 
described, because it contains little fat, little caseine, and 
much lactose or sugar of milk. All these proportions are 
reversed in cow's milk, which is therefore very unsuitable 
for the production of such a beverage. 

Mare's milk is transformed into kumys by two processes 
which run by the side of eacli other, one being tlie vinous, 
the other the lactic acid fermentation. A part of the caseine 
is precipitated, another remains iu solution. The whole of 
the milk-sugar is not always decomposed, and it is not 
always decomposed in equal proportions by both ferments ; 



6o2 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



here the art and practice of preparation determines the 
result, the theoretical demand being for a maximum of 
alcohol and a minimum of acid. This is satisfied by beating 
or stirring the milk strongly at a temperature of 30^ to 
35° C. while exposed to the air; the agitation does not 
prevent the lactic acid fermentation, advances the alcoholic 
fermentation, and prevents the butyric acid fermentation. 
The latter, when it occurs, makes kumys undrinkable for 
persons of refined taste. 

The caseiue of mare's milk undergoes important changes 
during the fermentation ; at first it is in part precipitated, 
but later on redissolves, so that while after 3 days about 
14 per cent, of the precipitate may be redissolved, after 16 
days 36 per cent, are found in solution. TJie sugar of milk 
diminishes rapidly, in the first 24 hours from the normal 
54 in 1,000 of milk to 18 parts ; it falls further after 2 days 
to 15 parts, after 3 to 12, after 5 to 9, after 9 to 7, after 
16 days to 6 per mille. The alcoliol in 1,000 parts of kumys 
is on an average after 24 hours 12 parts per mille, after 

2 days 15 parts, after 5 days IS, after 16 days 20 parts per 
mille. In kumys 5 months old, which no longer contained 
any sugar of milk, the amount of alcohol was 32 in 1,000. 
The lactic acid rises to h per cent, in the first 24 hours, 
and then scarcely doubles in 16 days. 1,000 parts of kumys 
contain after 24 hours 5 parts, after 2 days 6 parts, after 

3 days 7 parts, after 5 days <S parts. After this period the 
acid decreases again by combination with alcohol (etheriza- 
tion) to 7 on the ninth day, and rises to scarcely 8 again 
on the sixteenth day. The kumys of the first day has 
thus the same amount of acid as the best wines, the latter 
expressed as tartaric acid. The resolution of the ijvccipi- 
tatecl caseiue is partly due to the increase of the lactic 
acid, partly to change by peptonization. 

Kumys is mostly made in vessels constructed of smoked 
horse-skins, but also in wooden tubs ; its ferment is a mix- 



USE OF KUMYS, PEPTONISED MILK 603 



ture of heer or loine yeast and sour milk — i.e., lactic ferment. 
When it has begun to ferment it is beaten incessantly 
during twelve hours, at a temperature of 35°. It then is 
iceah kuDiijs, and is filtered from the excess of caseine if 
wanted for drinking. After twenty-four hours of fermenta- 
tion the weak kumys becomes vieclium strong, and remains 
so until forty-eight hours have elapsed. Strong hiunys is 
obtained only by agitating the mare's milk incessantly 
during more than forty-eight hours. It can be bottled, 
corked, and preserved under pressure on ice ; in the bottles 
it forms three layers, uppermost a little oil, in the middle 
the vinous solution , and below some caseine. Before use 
these are mixed by agitation. 

A person who drinks ten champagne quart bottles full, 
equal to a gallon and two-thirds of a gallon, of (mare's) 
kumys daily ingests as much nutriment as a strong adult 
requires — namely, nitrogenized matter, ^'S oz. ; fat, 4'3 oz. ; 
and carbo-Ji yd rates, !I5*2 oz. 

Tuberculous, i.e., pulmonary consumptive persons drink- 
ing sufficient quantities of kumys are observed to increase 
half a pound in weight daily during three to four w'eeks ; 
the pulse becomes quiet, fever disappears, and on the whole 
great improvement is effected. 

Under the influence of pancreatin, a ferment extracted 
from the pancreas, or sweetbread, of cattle, and sold by 
chemists, cows milk is transformed in such a manner that 
its caseine is no longer precipitable by acids or alcohol, but is 
in the state of (probably) assimilable ijeptone. It may then 
be mixed with acids, sugar of milk, or cane-sugar, and 
alcoholic preparations, such as rum, cognac or wine, and 
drunk as a nutritive stimulating beverage. Care must be 
taken to watch its effects, as in erethic persons it may prove 
intoxicating, even in small doses, by its quick absorption ; 
moreover, the taste of the alcohol is concealed, and its quan- 
tity may exceed the intention of the consumer unawares. 



6o4 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



Such ]}ei)tonizecl milk will probably prove useful in many 
culinary operations in which there is a risk of curdling 
ordinary milk. But the exact conditions of such usefulness 
will have to be ascertained by further inquiry. In the 
posset and in the (Devonshire) jicnJcet, to be described 
below, the milk is curdled expressly by luine, or acid, or 
rennet ; but in the several varieties of sillabub to be de- 
scribed lower down, the curdling of the milk in whole or 
part seems to be rather tolerated than intended or desirable. 
In these preparations the substitution of peptonized for 
unprepared milk may prove a decided advantage ; this sub- 
stitution will be much easier than it is at present at a 
future time, when peptonized milk may perhaps be sold 
almost at the same price as fresh. 

Junkets and sillabubs are mixtures of milk variously 
modified with - alcoholic and spicy additions. The deriva- 
tions of the names can be seen in the Explanation of Culinary 
Terms. A junket is made by adding to a pint of new, if 
possible yet warm, milk some watery extract of rennet, 
two ounces of pounded sugar, a teaspoonful of powdered 
cinnamon, and a glassful of brandy ; as soon as the mixture 
begins to stiffen, cover its surface with clotted cream, and 
strew powdered sugar over it ; from this latter addition it 
receives the surname of Devonshire junket. The preparation 
is to be eaten cold. Sillabubs are made by the addition to 
milk (or colostrum, the first milk which a cow gives after 
calving), of wine, e.g., sherry or madeira, port, cider, or 
brandy, spices, such as nutmeg and cinnamon, and 
sugar. Some collectors of recipes distinguish London, 
Staffordshire, and Somersetshire sillabub, but the localiza- 
tions are not characterized by any specificity. There is 
also a lemo)i sillabub, made of a pint of cream and the 
zest of two, the juice of five lemons, half a pint of sweet 
ivine and sugar, the mixture to be whipped for half an hour 
and put into glasses ; to stand for at least twelve hours 



JUXKIi'JS, SILLABUBS; VARIETIES OF CHEESE 605 



before being eaten. This is really a preparation of cream ; 
when it draws liquid it may be filtered off on muslin. A 
mixture of milk with cognac or rum is by Englishmen in 
India called ' tiger's milk.' 

The varieties of cheese commonly used in cookery require a 
short notice. Cheddar is a typical cheese formerly made at 
Cheddar, in Somersetshire, only, but now produced in several 
other counties of England and Scotland. From America, 
including Canada also, cheese made in imitation of Cheddar 
comes to us. It contains from 30 to 37 per cent, of ivater ; 
23 to 29 per cent, nitrogenizcd suhstance, or caseine and its 
pi'odticts ; 23 to 35, rarely near 40, per cent, oifat; from 1 
to 6 per cent, of extractives free from nitrogen ; and 3 to 5 
per cent, of salts. The savoury ingredient is very small 
in quantity, and has never been measured by analysis. 
Cheshire cheese has a very similar composition, but con- 
tains more carbo-hydrate extractive, mainly sugar of milk. 
Gruyere, or, as it should be called, Grauerzer, is of very 
regular composition, containing water, 32 to 35 per cent. ; 
caseine and producis, 29 to 32 per cent. ; fat, 24 to 32 per 
cent. ; a little sugar of milk ; and salts, from 3 to 5 percent. 
Parina or Parmesan Cheese contains from 27 to 35 per 
cent, of water, 34 to 43 per cent, of caseine and products, 
and only from 16 to 24 per cent, of fat. Edam {Edamer), 
Dutch cheese, contains from 32 to 42 per cent, of water ; 
19 to 24 per cent, of caseine and derivates ; 27 to 34 per 
cent, of fats ; 5 to 6 per cent, of sugar of milk. Of a great 
variety of other cheeses made and sold in the world, only 
few are, and that not often, used for cooking ; we therefore 
do not mention them in this place. 

Cheese owes the elements of its savour to the decomposi- 
tion of its caseine, this substance in its original state being 
by itself quite tasteless. For this decomposition the pre- 
sence of fat is not essential, but it seems convenient, as pre- 
venting the process from becoming excessive. Besides meat 



6o6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



and mushrooms, cheese is the only source in nature from 
which those gustatory elements can be drawn which con- 
stitute savouriness ; this was fully proved by the French 
physician and chemist Louis Proust, the discoverer of extract 
of meat, as we have shown above. 

Cheese is the most valuable animal food obtainable ; it is 
from two to three times as nutritious as the same money- 
value of ordinary meat ; yet an individual of Konigsberg 
consumes only 10 grm. per day throughout the year ; each 
head of the Paris population only 9 grm, ; each head 
of the population of London 16 grm., or half an ounce, 
daily. 

Round Dutch cheese might be used in cookery more fre- 
quently than it is. As it inclines to be saltish in taste, the 
latter fault may be eliminated by omitting the salt from the 
recipe selected (' Wyvern,' loc. cit., p. 230). Dutch cheese is 
also easily grated, and little inclined to mouldiness ; but while 
it is no doubt a little cheaper than Cheddar or Gloucester 
when absolute weights only are compared, it is also more 
watery and less flavoured, and thus the advantages of a 
lesser price are neutralized. 

A rich ripe cheese can rarely be used in cookery, but for 
the production of the fingers or straws of cheese {vide infra) 
almost any kind of cheese, green Stilton, Gorgonzola (some- 
times called StraccJiino), can be used ; even Boquefort cheese 
made from ewe's milk is applicable. 

Welsh Babbit may be defined as Cheese-toast. The name 
of this excellent dish is at present unexplained ; it may be 
Gaelic, and have originated in Wales. The conjecture accord- 
ing to which the name rabbit was a corruption of rare bit has 
no kind of probabihty in its favour. It deserves to be men-- 
tioned that, according to ' Wyvern,' native Hindoo cooka 
term Welsh rabbit Bamahin Toast, a correct if easy result of 
appreciation of analogy. There are plainer and more com- 
pound forms of Welsh rabbit ; one of the latter goes by the 



WELSH RABTUn RAMEOVINS, FONDUE 60^ 



imnie of Mod' Crab Toast. Bamcquin is a French expres- 
sion, of which we have not been able to iind either defini- 
tion or derivation. D.D. refers it to Patisserie, but under that 
word no definition occurs. ' Wyvern ' identifies ramequins 
with little fondues of cheese, and directs the cook to arrange 
them on a silver dish, and bake them for ten minutes, or 
until the cheese dressings of the toast rise. In this view 
ramequins are only a kind of Welsh rabbit, with a some- 
what ruore elaborate cheese composition. On the other 
hand, Bamequins in Capsules (paper cases) closely re- 
semble souffles, and might be classified with them, just as 
ramequins or croutons might be classified with Welsh 
rabbits. But a third kind of ramequins are really pre- 
parations of pastry, inasmuch as they consist of a basis and 
partial covering of puff paste, on, and in which, the souffle- 
like cheese paste is deposited. These we propose to terra 
puff' paste ramequins. When the cheese is mixed with the 
puff paste we obtain incorporated ramequins, of which the 
long, thin form is known to some cooks as cheese-straivs. 
We have here to establish a distinction betw^een rayncquins 
in cases or capsules, and fondues in capsules. The former 
contain either flour or breadcrumb as panada, which im» 
parts to them the souffle character ; the latter contain no 
flour or bread, and, to justify their name, must consist of 
cheese and eggs with spices only. 

Of the fondue Brillat-Savarin"^ says that the dish came 
from Switzerland, and consisted merely of scrambled egg^ 
{mifs hrouilles) and cheese, in such proportions as time anii

anecdote, how a M. de Madet, having been elected Bishop of Belley, \x\ 
Switzerland, towards the end of the seventeenth century, at the dinner 
following his enthronization, mistaking a fondue for a cream, ate it with 
a spoon instead of a fork, as was usual. He also gives a recipe for fondue 
extracted from the papers of M. Trollet, bailli of Mondon, in the canton 
of Berne. We merely repeat this tale about the Bishop's spoon to show its 
trivial nature. We believe he was right in using his spoon if the fondue, 
as is often the case, was underdone, and consequently fluid like custard in 
the middle. 



6o8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



experience had shown to be suitable. Some, e.(j. Careme, 
spell the name fondu. The proportions of ingredients are 
butter, one part ; Grmjere cheese, three parts ; eggs, six paits. 
We think that some of the whites of eggs might be left out 
of the composition. Fondues are mostly used as hors- 
d'oeuvres. 



CHAPTEE LV. 

SAVOURY AND SWEET TOASTS, OR ROTIES, AND 
CROUTONS. 

We learn from ' Wyvern ' that savoury toast is thoroughly 
useful and generally popular, at least, amongst East Indian 
exiles, but that it is rarely presented there. It can fre- 
quently be made at a pinch when the larder is all but 
empty, and a friend drops in unexpectedly. A dainty feeder 
will sometimes fancy it when he will scarcely look at any- 
thing in the way of food. If well made it serves as a finish 
to a little home dinner ; and it is equally acceptable at 
breakfast, luncheon, or supper. It is susceptible of elaborate 
as well as of simple treatment, and may be fashioned to 
obey the dictates of sumptuousness, as well as those of the 
strictest economy. A savoury toast should be served hot ; 
it should not be kept in the oven, but set before the diner 
the moment it is completed. Toast should be made before 
a clear fire, which radiates strongly from a body of glowing 
coals or embers, or a broad sheet of flame ; it can also be 
made on a hot-plate — i.e., the iron top of a hearth — but 
then requires more management. When the plate is not 
too hot, the bread may be placed directly in contact with it; 
if the plate be very hot, to red hot, the bread must be raised 
away from it, by a wire net, to the distance of an eighth of 
an inch or more. It must be quickly made, so that the 
moisture of the outside is driven into the interior, and 



TOASTS, ROTIES, AND CROUTONS 609 



makes that soft and fresh-tasting, while the dry outside 
becomes immediately and equally but hghtly browned. 

* Wyvern' maintains that, except in special cases, the slice of 
bread destined to receive any savoury composition should 
be delicately jrled in butter till it be of a golden colour. 
We for our part cannot consent to call such a preparation 
toast; it is fried bread, French crouton , Italian crustino ; 
nor can we consent to attribute to a crouton the same 
gustatory quality and digestibility as to a piece of toast. 
However, while holding them distinct, we may treat them 
side by side, inasmuch as they may be garnished with the 
same savoury preparations. The true French expression 
for toast is rotie, an ellipse from tranche de pain rotie, a 
feminine noun, and thus broadly distinguished from the 
male roti, a roast piece of meat. Some have given the 
following definition of roties : ' Tranches de pain qu'on fait 
rotir et sur lesquelles on sert differentes substances maigres 
ou grasses.' This we adopt, and do not allow croutons to 
be ranged under it. 

i\.mongst our selected recipes, the Indian ones from 

* Wyvern,' we find anchovy puree to be served on either toast 
or crouton, and several variations : Boties of Spinach, both 
savoury and sweet ; of Cucumber or Gourd ; of green French 
Beans ; of leaves and stalks of Beetroot ; of Indicui country 
greens, especially leaves of the mollay-keeray ; Bande-Cal 
(BJiindi) Toast; Brinjals {Bineguni) and Moringa Toast; 
Toast of the Floiver of the Coco-nut Palm ; Boties of Veal

k SANDWJCH consibts of at least two equal slices of either 
white or brown biead, an eighth of an inch in thickness, 
and butter, with some meat, such as ham, tongue, boiled or 
roast beef, mutton, poultry, or game, or a savoury prepara- 
tion thereof placed between them in such a manner that the 
buttered side of each slice of bread is inside and turned 
towards the meat; a sandwich can therefore be conveniently 
eaten while being held in the hand ; for the same reason 
it san be conveniently wrapped in paper, or packed in a 
little box, and consumed at the appointed time. For sand- 
wiches the bread should not be too fresh, but somewhat 
set ; it is also advisable to remove the crust before cutting 
the slices of bread, as this impedes the even cutting of the 
latter. Once made, sandwiches should be protected from 
drying by being kept covered or enclosed until the time 
when they are to be used. 

Favourite central ingredients of sandwiches are : Jiam 
and beef ; cheese and anchovies ; eyys, ijla'ui and conipoiuid ; 
cheese and fruit {e.g., Gruyere and x)lantains) ; salad; fish 
or fowl ; lobster; egg and anchovies, etc. An excavated roll 
may be stuffed with a salpicon. Excellent materials for 
sandwiches are Pomeranian Goose-breast, Strasburg Goose-

SOFT AND HARD WATER 6ti 



CHAPTEE LVII. 

BEVERAGES : WATER, WINE, CIDER, BEER, SPIRITS, 
CUPS, SHERBETS, TEA, COFFEE, AND TISANES. 

Water is the universal beverage of organized beings ; it is 
the hquefying agent by the solvent action of v^hich both the 
constructive and destructive processes of nutrition and pro- 
duction of power are carried on. Water should be clear, 
that is to say, free from suspended iiiqjitrities, and should be 
equally free from dissolved matter. The suspended im- 
purities are more easily recognised and removed, while the 
ciissolved ones are recognisable only by chemical reactions, 
and for the most part irremovable. The dissolved impurities, 
which are of objectionable influence upon various processes 
of cookery, are those which produce in water the qualities 
called temporary and permanent hardness. Temporary hard- 
ness is produced by solution of carbonate of lime (carbonate 
of calcium or chalk) under the influence of excess of car- 
home acid (carbonic anhydride). This can be removed by 
boiling the water during a f«w minutes, w^hen the carbonic 
anhydride passes away, or by addition of caustic lime, 
whereby the anhydride is neutralized, and in each case the 
chalk is deposited as a white or dusky powder. Permanent 
hardness, however, is caused by the presence of soluble 
neutral calcium salts, mainly sulphate or gijpsiom, and of 
magnesium salts, mainly sulphate and chloride. Both forms 
of impurity are distinctly injurious in many processes of 
cookery to the food to be, prepared, e.g., to leguminous seeds, 
as haricot beans, which are made hard thereby ; to green 
vegetables, which lose colour and tenderness ; to jellies, 
which are made turbid. In a great many cases of cookery 
soft or distilled luater is therefore absolutely essential to 
success ; haricot beans, peas, etc., are not only made hard in 



6i2 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



the mouth by hard water, but also more or less indigestible, 
and, therefore, to delicate or young persons positively 
injurious. 

In the kitchen three means can be adopted for obtaining 
practically sojt water. The best is to buy, and have always 
ready, a jar full of dis filled loater ; the second is to obtain 
and keep a supply of naiural soft luater, such as rain-water 
from pure sources, filtered, or such as many towns and 
districts have naturally at their disposal or are provided 
with by art. Several water- supplying institutions in England 
do actually soften all the water they deliver for domestic 
purposes, and this softening process, known as Clark's, 
ought to be applied to all water from chalky sources. 
Clark's process is, however, not very well adapted for 
private use. There remains, therefore, failing the processes 
just mentioned for use in the kitchen, when relatively soft 
water is desired, only the addition of some carbonate of soda 
to the water, followed by boiling, and decanting the clear 
water from the deposited carbonate of lime. Mere boiling 
also will relatively soften water, but requires a longer time 
than the boiling with the addition of some soda. The 
amount of soda to be added to the water to be boiled should 
not exceed the size of a filbert for a gallon of water. 

There are in many parts of the world, particularly in 
regions where volcanic action was formerly or is now going 
on, a great number of springs which contain, besides larger 
or smaller quantities of dissolved fixed mineral matters, a 
certain amount of dissolved gas, most frequently and mainly 
consisting of carbonic acid, now more commonly called 
carbonic anhydride. Such waters, being pure, refreshing, 
and wholesome, are in great demand. The best and 
longest known is the water of Selters in Nassau, in this 
country known as Seltzer (an abbreviation of Selterser), 
which was and is still sold in the actual state in which it 
rises in the \vonderful spring. The demand for similar 



AERATED WATERS, WINES 613 

waters having much increased, mamifactories were estab- 
lished in which common water was impregnated with 
carbonic acid gas, made at one time from soda, whence the 
water was called soda-iuater. In the present day all such 
waters are impregnated with gas made from chalk, or its 
ground, pulverulent form, called luhiting. The gas is gen- 
erally placed under high pressure, because the public are 
under the erroneous impression that they get the more of 
the stimulating effect of the gas the more of it is con- 
tained in the water. But the opening of such an over- 
charged bottle only leads to effervescence, loss of gas, and 
not rarely to uproarious overflow of water; and the water 
remaining in the bottle is immediately, by the unavoidable 
commotion, made more flat than would be natural mineral 
water charged under ordinary air-pressure, and at the 
temperature of the earth. But this delusion on the part 
of the public has gone further. Natural mineral waters 
are now deprived of their carbonic acid, and then recharged 
with it ; and for the results of this operation the public are 
content to pay high prices. Distilled aerated waters are the 
best, because they are not only free from organic impurities, 
but also free from those salts which in some of the most 
vaunted waters rise to an undue amount. Artificially 
aerated waters from common, perhaps infected, wells, or 
conducted supplies, are very unsafe, as the aeration kills 
none of the infectious germs, but rather favours the life of 
some of them. 

Wine and its varieties concern us in this work only in so 
far as they are used in the actual culinary preparation of 
dishes, or in as far as they serve the sesthetical purpose of 
beverages to be used in the course of meals, and particularly 
feasts. 

The wines of Xerez, or sherries, are white, and generally 
would be the best of all were they not afflicted with two 
adulterations — plaster of Paris and spirit. Owing to con- 



6i4 THE Sl'IRIT OF COOKERY 



tinued protests, the spirit in sherry has been somewhat 
diminished, and we hope that all addition of spirit and all 
plastering may ultimately cease entirely. Then sherry wall 
be of all white wines facile yrinceps. 

Sherry should bs drunk cooled to 52° Fahr., but not 
below, and should not be iced. It does not easily bear 
dilution with water, as this not rarely brings to notice 
undesirable peculiarities of the wine, which are hidden by 
either spirit or boiled must. Pale sherry is the most 
desirable, as it is necessarily the purest. Brown slierry, 
such as was in vogue at the beginning of the ctntniy, is^ 
now rarely drunk. 

Many South Spanish wines are called sJierry, without 
having any claim to that name by either the place of origin 
or the vine of which they are the produce. Another sub- 
stitution is that of Sicilian viarsala, or wine from other 
Mediterranean or Atlantic isles, mixed with a little sherry, 
and termed Amontillado. The consumer should distinguish 
the good from the bad wines by comparison. 

The i:)reiiarations of sherry most commonly used are 
numerous : Sherry Gobbler, a mixture of sherry, water, ice,, 
and sugar, flavoured with lemon; Sherry Punch, nuich used 
in Scandinavia; Mulled Sherry witli Eggs — the expression 
mulled practically means heated and spiced, but it is. 
supposed to be derived from the Latin mollio, I soften, 
make milder : it therefore also includes the siceeteiiing of 
acid and the diluting of alcoholized wine ; Posset, hot milk 
curdled with wine, derived from the Welsh i)osel, curdled 
milk — Irish pusoid (this should perhaps be classified with 
junkets and sillabubs ; but the term has also been applied 
to preparations made with wine and groats, and without 
milk) ; the same may be said of the Sack Posset — the 
rhymed recipe by one Sir Fleetwood Shepherd prescribes 
' Sack from Spain ' : the dish is really a sn-cet custard 
flavoured with sherry, and cannot properly be. called a 



117NI£S AXD PRE I' A RATIONS 6i: 



beverage ; Y'lnou^ Whey, made by adding wine to milk, and 
boiling and filtering from the curds — cider is very suitable 
for its production. 

Amongst the most favoured preparations of jwH wine is 
Mulled Port; Blsliop or Oxford Nightcap; Cardinal and 
variations. 

The red wines of Bordeaux, commonly called claret, should 
for drinking be warmed to 60' Fahr., or thirteen degrees 
higher than w^iifce wines. Of preparations there are : Claret 
Cup and variations ; Mulled Claret : Sauterne' Cup. The 
red and white wines of Burcinndy are suitable for analogous 
preparations. 

Chanipa(jne:i have now become so coarse that even most 
of the higher priced ones are no longer worthy of the 
patronage of the connoisseur, but participate in the qualities 
of reniedes contre V amour. Most of them are brandied up to 
12 per cent, of absolute alcohol. There are many fables 
of dishes cooked with champagne, the most ridiculous being 
Yuiilemot's faisan Lucullus, and some fish termed a la 
Genevoise; we have considered these eccentricitiLS in former 
chapters. Even vegetables arc reported to be cooked with 
this wine — e.g., Choucroute (sauerkraut) a la Champagne ; 
but they are in reality not so prepared. Stewed carefully 
with butter and standard broth, the sauerkraut receives 
just before it is dished an addition of a little high-liavoured 
v;ine, which imparts to it a fine ethereal flavour. On the 
bills of fare it figures as a la Champagne, which has not 
been near it. 

For the dinner-table champagne should be cooled, but 
never iced. The icj-pail, like the red wine basket ipanier), 
is a means for smuggling low-class wine into the stomachs 
of credulous people in exchange for the price of good 
ones. 

For certain culinary purposes — r.g., the production of 
custard wine sauces — old hock is the best material ; but for 



6i6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



eourt bouillon and similar preparations low-priced French 
wines have to be used. All white and red French and 
German wines are fit for the production of Woodruff Cup 
(made with Asperula odorata). Of some qualities of wine 
so-called Peach or FineajJi^le Bowl can be made ; the liquid 
may be drunk, the fruit eaten with a teaspoon. 

TniperiaJ or other siveet tokay is not a wine, but a sweet, 
made of raisins, and either entirely or almost unfermented ; 
consequently, like Bota Tent (Tintilla de Rota), which is 
made in the same manner, it contains only a small per- 
centage of spirit, and may contain none. If it contains 
above 4 per cent, it is certainly adulterated. 

Marsala is very useful for cooking purposes, except those 
cases in which high flavour is required ; of extractive it will 
furnish a sufficient quantity. 

As regards cider or apple wine, a revival has taken place 
of late years, and much excellent apple wine and perry is 
produced in Herefordshire and other counties. In Brittany 
and Germany also much cider is made and used. It is 
mixed in cups {e.g., with woodruff) as well as drunk at 
table. In hot seasons sparlding cider is a very agreeable 
and wholesome beverage. 

Beer is used for the production of some kinds of soup^ 
hot spiced driiihs, and cooling beverages, such as shandt/- 
gaff, a mixture of hops and malt beer with ginger-beer. 
The stronger and more hopped qualities are not used in 
cookery, but the varieties of medium strength are recom- 
mended in some recipes — e.g., for boiling certain joints in. 
Practically, we believe, these recipes are very rarely carried 
out. 

Flip, or Ale Flip, is warmed ale to which sugar, cognac 
or rum, and ginger and nutmeg, have been added ; this 
is beaten up with some stirred or frothed eggs, half the 
whites omitted, and well mixed. This preparation is in 
parts known as one yard of flannel. 



CUPS; SPJRITS 617 



Wassail BoivJ is an ancient Christmas Eve regalement, 
and consists of hot ale with several spices pom^ed over roast 
apples. 

Ale Cuj), Beer Cujh or Cool Tankard, is a mixture of ale 
with spices and sugar, fortified by brandy and sherry, and 
flavoured with capillaire and lemon ; to be cooled in water 
or ice. TewaMiddle is almost identical with this, but is 
apparently not to be refrigerated. Caudle (from the French 
chaiidel) is spiced warm ale with groats ; formerly any 
warm drink given to the sick was so called. In practical 
life we have never met with the expression. 

Sjjirits are distilled from fermented grapes {i.e., wine), 
from cherries, malted corn, potatoes, sugar-cane, etc. 
Many of these spirits are used in cookery. Cognac used to 
be the best flavoured of all spirits, but is now rarely to be 
had genuine at a reasonable price. It is an ingredient of 
many dishes, though only added on account of its flavour, 
or as alcohol to raise or carry a flavour ; it is also mixed 
with cups. Bum, the distilled spirit from fermented sugar- 
cane extract, is remarkable amongst spirits by its freedom 
from fusel oil or amylic alcohol, which spoils whisky and 
gin so frequently. It has a remarkably strong and, when 
pure, agreeable flavour derived from the cane, and refined 
during fermentation and distillation. This flavour can be 
imported into sauces and mixed with drinks, particularly 
of the class called imnch. Take care to obtain pure old 
Jamaica rum for cooking purposes, and avoid rum adulter- 
ated with whisky. Spirit distilled from malted and fer- 
mented corn simply is called whisky. When it is impreg- 
nated with the taste of smoke it is called Scotch. Corn 
spirit flavoured with oil of juniper is called gin. Spirit 
from rice is called arrack. Fermented cherries yield an excel- 
lent distilled spirit. Much of this is made in Alsatia, and 
termed cherry -water, German Kirschemcasser, or by a French 
abbreviation kirsch. When this spirit enters upon a French 



6i8 - THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



culinary composition, the latter acquires the title ftii KirscJi* 
Much is made in Dahnatia from a cherry called 7)iarasc]ie, 
hence called maraschino, and from the place of export di 
Zara. Maraschino is used in some compound drinks, but 
mainly in confections, to which it imparts a very fine flavour. 
The art of distilling spirits is so far developed, that from 
the niost unlikely materials chemically pure alcohol can l:>c) 
isolated. As this has no collateral taste, and does not 
reveal its origin, it is termed silent sj^irit. Such spirit is 
used in connection with cookery for the production of 
tinctures —/.i\, real solutions of colouring matters as well 
as alcoholic extracts of spices — for the preservation of many 
varieties of fruit, such as cherries (known in England as 
cherry hrandij), or pears, peaches, and plums, etc. ; in these 
alcoholic preserves many manufacturers in the South of 
France carry on a considerable trade. The English mince- 
meat, with which the Christmas mince-pies are perfected, 
should be made some weeks before it is used, and preserved 
during maturation by an addition of alcohol ; but when a 
cook uses so-called alcohol or spirit, he must remember that 
what practically comes into use is a mixture of alcohol and 
water, and of the ingredients he must know the relative 
proportions in order to correctly interpret any recipe. In 
England the strength of alcoholic liquids is usually stated 
in degrees of proof spirit. Proof spirit consists of about 
equal parts by weight of water and alcohol ; rectified spirit 
contains about 84 per cent, of alcohol and 16 per cent, of 
water; absolute alcohol contains one, or at most two, per 
cent, of water. These are preparations prescribed in the 
British Pharmacopoeia, and they can therefore be always 
obtained from any chemist and druggist. 

* The I'eader may note that the French buyers of kirsch rejected all such 
spirit as did not become blue with tincture of ^uaiacum, as not genuine. 
Bonssingault proved that this reaction was due to the presence of copper, 
imported by dirty stills. For years manufacturers who n)ade pure Kirschen.- 
wasser could not sell it at its prftper value. 



PUNCH AND ITS VARIETIES 619 



Punch is a specifically English preparation, and has a 
jovial history. It is an alcoholic drink made with the juice 
and zest of lemon, sugar, and any of the principal distilled 
spirits. The most characteristic punch is no doubt made 
with rum — at least, in part. To heighten its flavour some 
wine may be added, but never so much as will make its 
bouquet prominent. For the practice of a great establish- 
ment, a hotel, or restaurant, it is expedient to have the 
ingredients of punch ready, and with this view the cook or 
butler should prepare syrui:) of lemon, syrup of citric acid, 
quintessence of lemon-peel, tincture of lemon-peel, orange 
syrup (for punch and puddings), syrup of orange or lemon 
peel, quintessence of orange-peel, or curacoa, and variations. 

The actual mixing of the punch becomes an empirical 
process, for which no proportion can be stated without a 
previous knov/ledge of the strength of the spirit to be 
employed, and, in places of sale, of the profit to be exacted. 
Punch may be drunk hot or cold ; the hot form is preferred 
in winter. It should never be stronger than the presence 
of 20 per cent, of absolute alcohol will make it ; this is 
about the average strength of sherry or port wane. It will 
be more wholesome if it contain less spirit, down to 10 per 
cent, of absolute alcohol. A practised taster may adjust 
the alcoholicity of the mixture by mere gustation within 
2 per cent, of error. 

It is evident from the foregoing that a great many varieties 
of punch can be produced, but it is unnecessary to give even 
the titles of many. We will, however, point out the features 
by which some special sorts of punch are distinguished. 
The French cooks colour most rum punch of a dark amber, 
nearly brown, by means of caramel. In the production of 
caramel for this purpose great care must be taken to make 
the burnt sugar as little bitter as possible. In so-called 
Yorkshire (hot) Pujich some calf^sfoot jelly is introduced, 
possibly to give it some body, by means of which slight 



620 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

viscosity the taste may linger a little longer on tongue and 
palate than would that of a thinner liquid. Four quarts of 
punch may receive a pint of made calf's-foot jelly, contain- 
ing about half an ounce of dry gelatine. 

EecjenVs Funcli is a highly-compounded form ; the syrup 
is obtained by stewing 4 lb. of chopped muscatel raisins, 
filtering the juice, and condensing it, adding thereto sugar- 
candy. Dissolve this in a pint of strong green tea; add 
half a pint of rum, a pint of cognac, a bottle of madeira, a 
pint of curacoa, half a pint of pineapple syrup, a bottle of 
seltzer- water, and two bottles of champagne. Add orange 
and lemon as tinctures, and syrups to taste ; strain through 
cambric. This is a very seductive mixture to take a man 
unawares ; it should be at least partaken of out of little 
liqueur glasses only. 

lioman Punch is similarly complicated, with frozen white 
of egg froth superadded. Of this latter the role in the mix- 
ture is not very intelligible. 

Mill: Punch, like posset, or like the mixture of milk and 
cognac or rum called Tiger s Milk, and some of the drinks 
containing milk and eggs, resembling custards, may be con- 
sidered more as a preparation of milk than one of alcohol. 
But as it bears the name oi imnch it is expedient to treat of 
it in this place. There are several varieties of milk punch : 
strong, less strong, hot, and cold. The addition of milk, 
even more than of gelatine, will give to punch a body 
which develops and impresses its taste. It always remains 
a little turbid, except when kept a long time. But little of 
the caseine added in the milk is precipitated by the spirit. 
Much wine sold in trade is really milk- wine, as it is fined 
with skim milk. 

Wliisky Punch, or Toddy, is said to be a genuine Irish 
beverage; but more of it is drunk in the great British 
isle j^er capita than in the Irish. American Mint Julep 
is made with brandy. Julep is an ancient Arabian name 



CRAMBAMBULI, GINGER BEER, PULQUE (^ii 



for a calming drink, containing mucilage and opium ; 
for the latter alcohol has been substituted. American 
Toddy is a cold bowl of rum punch in which several 
kinds of fruit are steeped. West Indian Saugaree is a 
brandy punch with Madeira wine, characterized by the 
addition of lime-juice. 

A French culinary author says that ' for a long time a 
bowl of burning punch was in England the last and in- 
dispensable service of every well-appointed meal.' We have 
never seen punch on fire in this country, but we have 
witnessed on the Continent the production of the punch 
called cramhamhuli. It is made by setting fire to strong 
whisky contained in a soup-tureen or bowl, placed for safety 
in a cold water bath, and fusing sugar-candy on a w4re-net 
fixed in the flames ; the sugar, partly as caramel, dissolves 
in the whisky below. The preparation perhaps derives its 
name from banibalein, the Greek verb to stammer, as it is 
very intoxicating, although much of the spirit of the whisky 
is devoured by the flames. 

Ginger-beer, so called, is an excellent, refreshing, slightly 
alcoholic, effervescent, stimulating beverage ; the false non- 
fermented stuff made like soda-water should be distinguished 
from the classical preparation. 

Ginger Wine is an occasionally useful stomachic. 
Pulque is the sap of several varieties of agaves, called 
pulcrc, which are at home in Mexico ; the sap, when drawn, 
ferments, yields a wine, and a spirit by distillation. The 
wine, ijulque fuerte, is termed met or magney by the in- 
habitants of Mexico ; the amount of alcohol contained in it 
may rise to nearly 6 per cent, by volume. Palm sap and 
wine, called toddy in India, is a product in the collection of 
which specially-trained persons are employed. Maple yields 
a sap and a sugar. In North America these products are 
not rarely used for cooking ; in Europe they hardly ever 
occur. 



622 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Liqueura are sweet alcoholic preparations flavoured with 
vegetable essences. They are not beverages in the true 
sense, although they are taken out of little glasses and 
sipped. They are truly small gratifications for the organ of 
taste, and follow more substantial articles of food and drink, 
as the French say, ' pour la bonne bouche,' or to leave a 
pleasant impression upon the gustatory nerves. Liqueurs 
should never be of great Icoholic strength ; they should be 
of superb finesse of flavour, and sufliciently sweet to please 
ladies. Some liqueurs are prepared with the fruit of which 
they represent the essence, being kept in them, and are 
sarved with some of' the fruit, e.g., cherry hrancly. This 
popular preparation should be made with Morella cherries. 
x\ similar liqueur is rasi^herry brandy, but this is filtered 
and clarified. licUafia, also spelt ratajfia and tafia, is 
believed to be derived from the Malay tdfid, a spirit or 
liqueur prepared from cane-sugar syrup, therefore the East 
Indian original of the West Indian rum ; the prefix ra is a 
contraction of the Arabian arrach, the spirit distilled from 
malted and fermented rice, and sweetened, araq meaning 
both juice and sweet, i.e., as we term it, a liqueur. The 
spirit was flavoured in various ways, one consisting in the 
addition of sweet cakes, macroons of sweet and bitter 
almonds. By-the practice of steeping bitter almond macroons 
in spirit, and calling the product ratafia, any liqueur of 
bitter almond flavour, however made, is now called ratafia. 
When made from bitter almonds directly, or vv^ith pounded 
apricot or peach kernels, or cherry laurel or young ijeach 
leaves, the liqueur is called noyeau. The flavour of this 
latter is stronger and more specific, while the flavour of 
ratafia liqueur is milder and somewhat aromatic from the 
roasted or baked almonds. 

Liqueurs have lost much of their popularity in England, 
partly owing to the excessively high excise and import tax, 
partly to the injurious practice of hotel and restaurant 



LIQUEURS AND SHERBETS 623 



keepers of pricing a thimbleful of any fine liqueur at a 
shilling. In private houses several of them, e.g., cherry 
brandy, Danish or Kentish cherry liqueur (kerse beer), are 
still cherished ; in some, curaroa is made according to the 
rules of the art; many patronize mavascliino. Here and 
there one meets yet with that exquisite liqueur parfait 
d'amoiiv, but the march of intellect will soon banish it to 
darkest Africa. The South of Europe will continue to enjoy 
that exquisite flavour of anisette which gives such a recon- 
ciling warmth and aroma to cold water on a hot summer's 
day. Angelica will flavour the rye spirit of the Scandina- 
vians up to the North Cape, no less than the trois-six of 
the South French Carthusians and the Goldwasser of the 
Dantzicers. A cook has many opportunities for applying 
to his dishes some well-flavoured and seasoned liqueur ; 
but it should be used for flavouring only, and the alcohol 
should be restricted to such quantity only as is necessary to 
carry the flavour. 

SJierbets in the East are made of many varieties of fruit, 
fresh, preserved, and inspissated. In England effercescent 
sherbets, including lemonade, are now much more in use 
than formerly ; for both healthy and sick they form pleasant 
beverages. Lemonade and orangeade are sufficiently well 
known ; compound lemonades are not much used, e.g., 
lemonade and whey. Bhuharb sherbet, made from the ex- 
tract of stalk, with sugar, requires a zest to flavour it. 
Other sherbets may be made with fruit syrups, fruit jellies, 
and fruit jams : raspberries, currants, luhite, red and black ; 
cherries — the sw^eet ones, require acid additions, the mo- 
rellas and Kentish pie cherries, not ; barberries, apricots, 
apples, quinces, mangoes, cranberries, grapes, even in the 
unripe state as verjuice ; gooseberries also in the unripe, 
half-grown condition. Strawberries are less suitable. Phims 
are least suitable, as their juices are not easily separated 
from the flesh, and form better jams and cheese. Sherbets 



624 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



may be drunk from cups, or sipped with a teaspoon. In 
London refreshment places sherbets so called are frequently 
made with acid, drops as sold b}^ confectioners ; an ounce 
of such drops dissolved in from four to six ounces of boiling 
water in a cup forms a sherbet of a refreshing nature. 
Oxyinels of the ancient Pharmacopoeias have a luxurious taste 
and cooling action ; one in particular is established all over 
the world — raspherry vinegar. 

Emulsions, such as milh of almonds, pistachios, coco-nuts, 
poppy seeds, are excellent preparations if skilfully made. 
The milk of coco-nut has a very fine flavour ; it is used for 
the confection of curries. Syrup of almonds, or orgeat, 
may be kept ready, and on being mixed with water will 
make milk of almonds, but the milk from almonds directly 
is preferable. Syrup should be made by cooks with great 
care. Sijrup of capillaire, e.g., should be made at home, as 
it is often counterfeited with curcK^oa and neroli oil in spirit. 

There are many excellent varieties of raio coffee in the 
market. By buying some raw coffee and roasting it your- 
self, you have the certainty of purity of the product ; its 
quaUty you must ascertain by taste. You can also buy the 
coffee roasted in the bean, and grind it yourself. Or you 
may buy it ground, in which case you have to take care to 
buy it from a merchant who will sell it unadulterated with 
chicory or any other strange vegetable matter. 

The roasting of coffee should be done either in a very 
thick iron saucepan, with constant stirring, if it have to be 
done over a strong fire, or in a revolving drum of sheet iron 
over little flames of gas, brushwood, or pine cones. The 
berries should be sufficiently roasted to be crisp, and break 
easily on pressure, yet they should not be over-roasted. In 
either case the aroma is missed which characterizes good 
coffee. 

You can make very good coff'ee by merely infusing with 
boiling water a certain quantity of ground coffee, and filter- 



COFFEE. TEA, VERBA, AND CHOCOLATE 62= 



ing the infusion through a sieve, a cloth, or paper ; the 
latter medium gives the brightest product. But this pro- 
cess of merely infusing is very wasteful, even when the 
coffee is linely powdered. It is preferable to unite the jj/o- 
ces8 of hoilhiij and infusing in the following manner : Place 
the amount of coffee which it is intended to use, less about 
one-tenth of its bulk, which is to be reserved, into the vessel 
in which you want to boil it, and pour over it the measured 
quantity of cold water ; now heat to ebullition and keep 
boiling for some minutes ; then take the vessel ott^ the fire 
and add to the liquid the reserved tenth part of the coffee, 
and stir it well in, but without boiling the mixture again. 
Let stand a few minutes, and then pour the coffee on the 
filter, liquid first, grounds last. 

To heep coffee Jiot, place the vessel containing it in a water- 
bath, but do not heat it directly on a hot-plate, or on the 
nre, as.it thereby alters its taste somewhat, and assumes 
the quality of merely boiled coffee. Boiled coffee is rarely 
bright when merely decanted, but requires filtration to 
become so. 

In Europe tea is generally prepared ])y infusion of the 
leaves with boiling water, the vessel in which the infusion 
is made being warmed and rinsed previously with boiling 
water. The Japanese reduce their tea to a fine powder by 
pounding it ; they put a certain portion of this into a teacup, 
pour boiling water upon it, stir it up, and drink it as soon 
as it is cool enough. 

Dubuisson recommended to put cold water into a kettle 
with the tea, cover it close, set it on the fire, and make it all 
but boil ; when you see a sort of white scum on the surface 
take it from the fire ; when the leaves sink it is ready. Or 
the night before you wish to have tea ready for drinking, 
pour on it as much cold water as you wish to make tea ; 
next morning pour off' the clear liquor, and when you wish 
to drink it make it warm.

626 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERV 

This last method is perhaps not to be advised for general 
use, as all that portion of Uiehi, which is in combination 
with tannin, and then very little soluble in cold water, and 
not even easily soluble in hot, will reoiain unextracted. 
But for producing tea with a minimum of astringency the 
process is useful. 

The leaves of Yerba or- Paraguay tea are always obtained 
in a powdered state. The powder is placed in a vessel 
made frequently of a coco- nut or pumpkin, and infused 
with boiling water ; the made tea is then sipped through a 
tube to which a sieve is attached, which is dipped into the 
vessel. It is sweetened, but not poured out into cups. 

To appreciate the true flavour of cJiocoIatl, as the Mexicans 
term it, obtain cacao-beans ; roast them yourself until the 
shells break easily, peel the reddish-brown marrow, and 
pound and triturate it in a hot iron mortar. Boil the paste 
with milk and sugar, agitate, and after shght repose pour 
off the top liquid containing the finest particles. The sedi- 
ment you can triturate again, and treat as the first part was 
treated. The chocolate is then ready for use, but to develop 
its full flavour you should let it get cold, remove any fat 
collected on the surface, and after twelve hours' standing 
heat it again in a water-bath. Chocolate is obtainable in 
many forms, in plates and as powder, with and without 
sugar. The powders, called cocoa, are generally reputed to 
be deprived of most of the natural fat. In exchange they 
are frequently adulterated with starch. Chocolate should 
be served in cups, and be of sufficient consistency to be eaten 
with a small spoon, rather than drunk. In this way it was 
used by the Mexicans ; they also ate it with golden spoons. 
We have tested the combinations, and find chocolate in

MEALS OF THE ANCIENTS 627 



CHAPTEE LVIII. 

NOTES ON THE COOKERY AND MEALS OF FORMER 
GENERATIONS. 

In very ancient times people uit doion to dinner at tables 
as they do in the present day. Thus, the Egyptians did, 
according to Apollodorus in ' Athenseus,' sit down at table 
to eat. At Eome they sat down until the end of the second 
Punic war (202 B.C.). The lying doivn on couches for the 
purpose of eating a dinner was an invention of the Greeks. 
It was properly termed an uncomfortable luxury, and was 
probably confined to the upper classes, for it required much 
service. At a feast which Ortagenes, the Theban, gave to 
fifty of his friends, and to which he invited the Persian 
general Mardonius and his suite, numbering also fifty 
persons, a few days before the battle of Platasse (479 b.c), 
the company, assembled in a large hall, reclined on fifty 
couches, each of which was occupied by a Greek and a 
Persian. 

We are not aware of the exact time at which society was 
released from the practice of lying down in order to take a 
meal. The release was delayed mainly by the fact that the 
conversation amongst the cultivated guests became highly 
attractive, general, and oratorical, and on account of the 
esprit displayed in it was called Attic salt. Thus, it came 
to be believed that posture had some mysterious connection 
with the conversational result of the dinner, and therefore 
was abandoned only reluctantly. 

According to Varro, the Eomans preferred to dine in 
company numbering not less than the number of the Graces, 
namely three, and not more than the number of the Muses, 
namely nine. Amongst the Greeks the number seven was 
that to which they desired to raise or limit their company, 



628 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



as was alleged, in honour of Pallas ; for this number was 
brought into a mystic connection with wisdom as well as 
virginity. Plato was in favour of the number twenty-eight, in 
honour of some astronomical considerations connected with_ 
that number which have received various explanations. The 
Emperor Octavianus Augustus, during whose reign women 
began to take a more conspicuous place, and apparently a 
more active share, in the life of Eoman society, generally 
had twenty-four persons at his table, half of whom were 
women. The Emperor Varus desired always to have twelve 
diners at his table, in honour of the planet Jupiter, which 
was supposed to perform its course in twelve years (actually 
eleven years and nearly 315 days). 

In France no particular number of diners was fancied 
more than another, but the number thirteen was objected 
to, as it is by superstitious people in the present day. In 
Italy, however, during the period of the Eenaissance, the 
number of thirteen was not even noticed, much less 
objected to. 

In * Athenseus ' we can read of the kinds of fisli and 
vegetables most fancied at Rome; of imported vegetables 
were most esteemed the radishes of Mantinea, the turnii:>s 
of Thebes, and the beetroot of Asia. The Eomans knew all 
good fish, and took care to serve their tables well with 
them ; those fishes which had nice colours, and were of 
lively aspect, were exhibited living on the table just before 
being killed and cooked. They had sturgeon brought as far 
as from the Caspian. Over fish even the Senate is reported 
to have lost its self-possession, as when, what is almost in- 
credible, and perhaps an invention of a satirist, it advised 
the Emperor Domitian to have a certain turbot prepared 
with a particular sauce. A frequently used dish was Jierrmgs 
from the ^olian, now Liparian, Isles. 

Of fl,esh food the Romans had nearly the same kinds as 
we have now, and probably in very large quantity. It is

Said that they knew turkeys under the liame of meleagrides 
(i.e., aves), on which see sup'a ; these probably came from 
Asia and were rarities, certainly not used for food as 
commonly as nowadays, but mainly kept as ornamental 
birds, like the peacocks and hens in farms, courts, and 
parks. Our present turkey carae to us from America, 
although it bears many names, including turkey and calicut, 
which point to an intermediate starting - point. The 
pheasant, which the Argonauts had brought to Greece, was 
imported into Italy, together with the cJierry and the peach, 
by Lucullus. The Greeks and Eomans ate dogs,'^ and con- 
sidered them, when young, plump and carefully prepared, 
delicate and wholesome food, as the Chinese do in the 
present day. 

Dinners were made the means of luxurious exhibitions 
first amongst the Eomans. The augur Hortensius, on his 
appointment, gave a dinner at which, for the first time, a 
roasted peacock, with its principal feathers restored to it, 
was served on the table. At ceremonial dinners pies with 
a hundred small birds became fashionable ; later on dishes 
made of fillets of such birds, which were more convenient to 
eat; this gave rise to the fables about the pates composed 
of the tongues of nightingales and other singing birds. 

What the condition of cookery may have been during the 
Middle Ages it is not easy to ascertain, just because there 
is no literature which might have recorded the practices 
even of the highest and ruHng classes of society. Careme 
rather puts the cart before the horse, when he says of the 
Middle Ages : * When there was no longer a kitchen in the 
world, there was also no literature, no longer any high and 
quick intelligence, no longer any inspiration, no longer any 
social idea.' This is mere declamation, particularly the 
part about ' inspiration ' and ' idea,' and reminds of the 

' Cf. Hippocrat., 'De Diset.," ii. ; Cxaleu, ' De Aliment. Facult.,' iii. ; 
Suyer, ' Pantropheoti," p. 150. 



630 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



American Emerson and his claptrap about inspiration of 
daily thought. VJ Au inspiration must needs be a communica- 
tion from without by spiritual means, not by materials 
coming from the kitchen. J But neither is there any proof 
that in the Middle Ages there was no * kitchen,' meaning 
that there existed no art and practice of cookery. And, 
indeed, when we study closely the system of Eoman cookery, 
Ave do not easily perceive that much could be lost that was 
superior to the practice of any nations that rose at all above 
the level of ' the age of innocence and acorns.' 

Gastronomy was restored by the opulent cities Genoa, 
Venice, Florence, Milan. Autocratic rulers, who, like all 
tyrants, including spiritual ones, are deteriorated by con- 
tact with their tools, did much less for culture and refine- 
ment than republican cities. Even the hierarchy did not 
much for the promotion of the culinary art, although they 
used it when it was achieved. But with art in general, that 
of cookery also rose in Italy, and much by the same kind 
of genius, beginning with Leonardo da Vinci ; from Italy it 
spread into France and Germany, together with the luxury 
so well represented in contemporaneous pictures, particu- 
larly by Paul of Verona in the ' Wedding of Cana.' When 
the new science of cooking and dining had passed into 
France with Catheriae of Medicis, it developed there under 
the reigns of Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry III., 
covering a period of thirty years — 1559 to 1589. Then 
returned again that most desirable of all table luxuries — 
the service of clean table linen-which had been practised 
at the time of Augustus, but had been discontinued in the 
retrogression of the Middle Ages. 

For a highly instructive and attractive description of 
cookery and dining as practised by the highest classes at 
the time of the Eenaissance, we may refer the reader to the 
article of the late Sir A. H. Layard already quoted, p. 13. 
One of the principal results of this relation was that the 



RENAISSANCE COOKERY AND DINING 631 



Italians knew little of the elements of savour as we under- 
stand them now, but dressed even naturally savoury dishes 
so as to make them sweet, or accompanied them with sweet 
entremets, as we do pork and goose with apple sauce, or 
mutton and venison with currant jelly. 

Tlie time of day at which the wealthy classes took their 
meals was dilferent from that at which they take them 
now. Of course, the great majority of mankind always 
took their principal meal at about noon -tide, and will 
necessarily always do so. But a select minority did find it 
more convenient, and will hereafter find it expedient, to 
deviate from that habit, and take their meals at different 
hours. And thus it has been during the last three hundred 
years. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, under 
Louis XII. and Francis I., the upper classes of the French 
' dined ' at ten o'clock in the morning ; they ' supped ' at 
four o'clock in the afternoon. In the seventeenth century 
they ' dined ' at noon, and ' supped ' at seven o'clock p.m. 
On the peculiarities of this period, the reader may consult 
the * Memoires ' of the physician Herouard, who kept a 
list of the breakfasts and dinners of Louis XIII. x\t this 
time the dinner was announced by blowing a horn ; from 
this came the order, •' Cornez le diner. '^ 

The social statics of cooks has seen great fluctuations in 
historical times. Athens had never what the Eomans 
termed a great — i.e., a grand — kitchen; nevertheless, the 
best cooks at Eome were Greeks, as the best cooks in our 
days are reputed to be Frenchmen. These officers were 
highly valued, and enriched by their conquering masters ; 
thus, Antony gave a town to one of his chefs de cuisine. 
The office of carver also was considered of great importance. 
All these arrangements were revived at the Renaissance, 
and developed in extreme intensity. The office of cook, or 
of privy cook, and of carver, or trinciantc, were deemed 

■■" Of. ' Noiiv. Alnuuiuch d. Gounn.,' iii. (1827), p. 17'^. 



632 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



not incompatible with rank ; this is proved, a.(j., by an order 
of the Council of Louis XI. of France, whereby an old cook 
of a Madame de Beaujeux, named Cyrant de Bartas, had 
his nobility maintained and confirmed. But the holders of 
such offices, whose title was maitre rpieux or grand qiieu.x, 
were probably not operative cooks at all, but such orna- 
mental intermediaries of great households as we should 
now describe as maitre de la bouche. The cuocos segretos of 
some of the Popes, jjrlvy cooks, were in similar exalted 
positions. The celebrated French jurisprudent author, 
Montesquieu, was descended from Eobin, second cook of 
the Connetable of Bourbon, ennobled by this prince. 
Henry IV. raised to the noblesse Nicolas Fouquet, Seigneur 
de la Varenne, and head-cook of Queen Marguerite, for 
services rendered in his culinary office ; he had, moreover, 
acquired property which returned him an annual income of 
70,000 francs, acquired, as Queen Margot is reported to 
have said, ' non pas en piquant ses poulets, mais en piquant 
ceux du roi.' 

Female cooks in Paris are sometimes called cordons hleus, 
from the supposed order which one of their predecessors is 
related to have received from a King of France. Two 
theatrical authors, Messieurs Brasier and de Demassan, are 
related to have passed some incautious observations on tlie 
order in one of their plays, which trie cooks took notice of ; 
for a long time they were revengefully treated in various 
ways, they being kept under the fear of having their meals 
mixed with deleterious ingredients. The passions of many 
persons became roused, and caused them to take part for or 
against female cooks. Of such a one, who was in the service 
of Madame du Deffant, and, although she stood in the odour 
of sanctity, was a very bad cook, the President Renault is 
reported to have said that the only difference betw^een her 
and (the poisoner) Brinvilliers was in the intention. 

The chic/ butler ot a great or royal house was termed 



liSTRODUCTION OF SPOONS, KNIVES AND FORKS 633 



grand sommelier,'^ hence the buttery, or pantry, was called 
sommelkrlc. 

With the quality of the manual service at dinner rose 
the perfection of the apparatus for its consumption. The 
ancients ate loith the right hand, with which they fetched 
the single morsels out of the common dish. Sauces 
were taken up with pieces of bread. As dipping of the 
tingers into hot dishes became painful, Eoman dandies 
and gourmets put on gloves expressly for being able to 
eat their viands hotter than they could by the ordinary 
method. The use of spoons, other than of bread, of forks 
and knives at the dinner-table by the diners was entirely 
unknown. 

The earliest progress from fetching the food with the 
fingers to transferring it to the mouth with the aid of 
simple tools was made by the Chinese, w^ho, to this day, 
throughout all classes of society, eat their solid food with 
thin wooden rods from six to eight inches long, called cJiop- 
stlcks, and manage them with admirable dexterity. The 
table implements of Europe find little sympathy amongst 
them. 

The introduction of spoons, kniccs, and forks] as tools 
for eating food began about the sixteenth century. When 
spoons and forks began to be used at Venice, notably 
by the wife of a son of the Doge Peter Orseleolo, she 
was censured for this ' insensate luxury ' by one Peter 
Damian, an ecclesiastic, and the vengeance of Heaven was 
called down upon her and her husband by the fakir. As 
both husband and wife died of the plague, Peter Damian 
thought he had been heard by his revenging god ; but his

t The English people are indebted to Tom Coryat for introducing the 
fork, for which boon somebody gave him the sobriquet of Furcifer (from 
jnrca (pitch), fork, andyero, I bear). See his ' Crudities,' 1611 edition, in 
'Letters fr;.in India,' 3 vols,, 8vo., 1776, vol. i., p. 106. Ex Kitchiner, 
he. cit., p. 32, note. 



634 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



declamation did not arrest the progress of forks and spoons 
over the entire globe. 

Bottles, jars, and crocks of unglazecl earthenicare are 
amongst the earliest results of human ingenuity, and were 
brought to Cornwall by the Phcjenicians with the art of 
pottery, which they introduced. The smaller articles of 
pottery were made glazed, but the large jars for the keeping 
of wine remained unglazed for a long time. Glass bottles 
for domestic use did not occur before the fourteenth century, 
and then in France. Skiiis for the carriage of water and 
the keeping of wine are ancient institutions, but little is 
known about their invention or history. The introduction 
of glass vessels for holding and drinking liquids out of is 
mainly the result of Venetian enterprise, and to this day 
Venetian glass maintains a beauty which even its Bohemian 
rival has not been able to eclipse. 

Dining-houses were in great towns at all ages. One at 
Kome was made notorious by the poet Horace, who there 
contracted an indigestion by eating * sheep's head ' ; this 
dish he ever after shunned, like a burnt child the fire. In 
Paris the common people took their meals at cabarets, 
localities which Bautree somewhat exaggeratedly defined as 
places 'on Ton vend de la folic a la bouteille.' There were 
traiteurs who sold entire cooked joints or dishes to citizens 
who did not care to have their own kitchens, but fetched 
their meals across the street. But there were no actual 
restaurants, such as we know them now, before the year 
1750. In that year the first establishment bearing such 
a title was founded at Paris by a cook of the name of 
Boulanger. Over his shop and dining-room was the in- 
scription in Latin, * Venite omnes, qui stomacho laboratis, 
et ego restaurabo vos ' ('Come to me, all you who are 
hungry, and I will restore you to comfort.' The French 
Kevolution spread liberty, intelligence, land, money, and 
well-being amongst the previously oppressed classes, no 



FRENCH DINING-HOUSES AND DINNERS 635 



doubt at the expense of classes who were oppressed in 
return, and social Hfe took a new form, so that, according 
to Dumas, one could at the end of the eighteenth century 
dine at a good restaurateur's at Paris for 12 francs as well 
as M. de Talleyrand at his palace, and better than at 
M. de Cambaceres's table. 

Before the Bevolution of 1789, dinners in good French 
houses were well selected, not exaggerated as to quantity 
of material or number of dishes, and in keeping with the 
means. This relative simplicity (compared to the wasteful 
extravagance of the restored Bourbon, Louis XVIII.) 
characterized the households of Louis XV. and XVI. The 
following was a bill-of-fare for a dinner in a good French 
house in 1740 : First service : Soup ; bouilli (boiled fresh 
beef) ; an entree of veal cooked in its juice ; a hors d'oeuvre. 
Second service : A turkey; a dish of vegetables; a salad; 
sometimes a cream. Third service : Cheese, fruit, and a 
pot of confitures (preserves). Plates were changed only 
three times — after the soup (the bouilli was eaten from the 
soup plates), before the second service, and before the 
dessert. Cafe was rarely given, but on great days ratafia 
of cherries, etc. 

There are cynical persons who profess to despise — or, at 
all events, rate lowly — the liking for good food which the 
French call fricuidise. The refine ineiii of food is not only 
the efflux of culture, but also has an important influence 
upon the mind, and consequently upon the abilities and 
manners of man. J ' Tell me what you eat, and I will tell 
you what you are,' is a paraphrase of a saying concerning 
the influence of conipany, and is equally true. Many 
persons mistake a natural, desirtible daintiness for gluttony, 
ov gloutonnerie—a^s Montaigne once termed it, 'La science 
de la gueule,' or ' The science of the gullet.' We hold 
absolutely with the * gourmandise des esprits delicats ' ; if 
it cannot be satisfied, vitality is diminished, and life is 



636 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



shortened. We recognise friandise in its twofold significance 
—firstly, as the mode or condition of mind of persons who 
like delicate, maybe select or rare, things ; and, secondly, 
as these things themselves. Such a person who desires 
quality for his food is termed a friand ; he is far superior 
to the gourmand, who sets up for quantity and multiplicity. 
This significant French expression is now almost as obsolete 
as the old cognate \erh friander ; but society will practise 
what it signifies more than ever. 

The wit of the Parisians has, however, emhaXmed friandise 
in an imperishable form. 'Avoir le nez tourne a la friandise 
comme Saint Jaques de i'Hopital,' is an expression derived 
from an image of St. Jaques de I'Hopital over the building 
of that name near the Eue aux Oies at Paris, a street since 
become by corruption Rue aux Ours ; in this street were 
the shops of the principal meat-roasters of Paris. As the 
saint looked in the direction of the frying shops, he was 
said to have ' le nez tourne a la friandise.' 

The period of transition in cookery to modern times 
coincides with the great French social scrimmage. The 
Piepublicans and the Directorate accepted and used all the 
culinary traditions of royalty and aristocracy — we have the 
accounts and the menus of their dinners and feasts ; but 
refinement gradually yielded to coarse extravagance. After 
Napoleon came the Restoration, and with Louis XVIII. a 
system of gluttony and waste. This is sufficiently charac- 
terized by the bill of-f are of a royal dinner on a maigre 
day. The king began persecuting the new men who had 
served Napoleon ; amongst the victims of this policy was 
the Marquis de Cussy, who is described by Dumas as * the 
last gastronomist of the epoch.' He had been cast out of 
office, and the King refused to listen to his petition for a 
place ; but hearing from a courtier that M. de Cussy was 
the inventor of a mixture of strawberries, cream, and 
champagne, the King at once wrote under the application 



DETERIORATION OF CUTJXARY ART 637 

for a salaried appointment, ' Accorde !' We have seen an 
account of an interview which the King's official taster of 
peaches, M. Petit Eadel, had with a peasant grower. From 
the history of the King's fruit jury, of which this peach- 
taster was a member, may be judged the nature of the 
reign, which afflicted France, effected the felonious invasion 
of Spain, and caused even Chateaubriand to be disgusted at 
Cabinet councils, which sat mainly for the purpose of listen- 
ing to the King's small jokes. During the fifteen years of 
the elder Bourbon rule, culinary science in France made no 
progress, notwithstanding the effort which was manifested 
by the publication of the second series of the ' Almanach des 
Gourmands.' The July scrimmage of 1830 brought new life 
to France, and with it gastronomy assumed new forms, of 
which the reader can learn the details in D.D., p. 65. The 
Orleanist Government is described as one * qui probable- 
ment avait de la sympathie pour les viveurs,' for * it ruled 
by truffles.' The sympathies of Louis Philippe were enlisted 
for soups, which we know from the * Almanach ' were rapidly 
deteriorating ; he sometimes ate four plates full of different 
soups, and a fifth in which he had the others all mixed up. 
Perhaps if the soups had been better, he would have eaten 
a smaller volume, and ' Mr. Smith with his old woman ' 
might never have crossed the Channel. 

The downfall of culinary art is characterized by the 
story of the man who engaged to eat a dinner of the value 
of 500 francs, and in this country by Soyer's one hundred 
guinea dish produced for a banquet at York. Dumas be- 
lieved that he had assisted at 'the last supper of genius,' 
and in a climax of vanity exclaimed, ' On mangera toujours, 
mais on ne dinera plus, et surtout on ne soupera plus.' 
Notwithstanding, both dinners and suppers have survived, 
but people talk less transcendentalism about them. 



63<S THE SITRIT OF COOKERY 



CHAPTEE LIX. 

THE PHILOSOPHY OF DINNERS AND OF DINING. 

At various periods the order of dinners and feasts has beea 
made the subject of social conventions. We have seen in 
the chapter on the historical literature of cookery that at 
the great dinners of the time of the Benaissance almost 
every dish constituted * a course,' and as there were from 
twelve to sixty dishes, a dinner lasted many hours. Sub- 
sequently dinners became agreeably simplified, the courses 
were subordinated to ' services,' and the services were re- 
duced in number, first to four, then to three, and it is now 
proposed to confine a dinner to two so - called services. 
But this contraction from four to two services effects no 
difference in the actual dinner ; it only appears a little 
differently on the bill of fare. On the bills of our forefathers 
soup and fish constituted the first course ; entrees and joints 
the second ; game and sweets the third ; cheese and dessert 
were by some made a course, by others treated as an un- 
titled appendix. This was therefore a dinner of four courses y 
and there was no question of service. The latter word is of 
French origin, and has really only a classifying or syste- 
matizing significance. Assume, as some extremists would 
have us do, that a dinner consisted of a single ' service,' it 
would not thereby lose any of the typical kinds of dishes, 
which in our opinion are the true ' courses ' of a dinner, an^ 
remain for our time at least pretty well immutable. As- 
sume, with 'Wyvern,' that the ' modern' menu were placed 
before us in two services, it will still retain the eight varieties 
of dishes which could properly be called courses, or be 
ranged under such. Now, if the word * service ' have any real 
meaning, it must be derived from the manner in which the 
dinner is served ; there must be a change on the table by 



SERllCES A\D COl^k'SKS OF DIXXERS 639 

which the division is manifested or characterized. In 
England, as well as on the Continent, just before the dessert 
the table is almost cleared, and a new set of plates, knives 
and forks, and glasses are set before the diners, constituting 
a change which may well be termed a service. On great 
occasions the dessert is served in a new room, to which the 
guests adjourn from the dining-room ; in this case the dessert 
could by no means be called a part of a single service dinner, 
but would constitute a second service, unless it was con- 
tended, which would be absurd, that dessert was no part of 
the dinner at all. 

For ourselves, we adhere to the French system of three 
ser rices,''' so called, meaning by services convenient divi- 
sions of the various courses of the dinner, betw^een which 
there might even be a slight pause. We hold that soup, 
hot and cold hors d'oeuvres, iish, releves, and entrees com- 
pose the first service ; the second service is composed of the 
roasts and entremets, the third of cheese and dessert. We 
will now consider these courses a little more in detail, 
enumerating them first in succession, and classifying them 
on the left in two services, so called, on the right in three. 

Parallel of the Two and Three Service System, the Courses 
remaining the same.

loc. cit., notes. 



640 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



at dinner, as we liold that it always will act beneficially, 
provided it be good. Any disrepute of soup can only be 
owing to its frequently low quality. Nothing is rarer than 
good soup at grand dinners. The grand cooks either attri- 
bute little importance to soup, or they do not know how to 
make it ; enough, it may be stated, as a fact ascertained by 
frequent observation, that they produce bad soup. Some of 
them employ most of the bouillon for their ragouts ; others 
give no time to the production of the soup, and fill up the 
diminished contents of the stock-pot with water. A French 
author, in affirming and lamenting that state of affairs, 
praised \\iq pot-aii-Jeu as a preventive of bad soup; but the 
modern essence of meat, Proust's immortal discovery, has 
made even this unnecessary, and has put the smallest 
menage in a position to produce as good soup as the largest 
estabhshment, and, what is of still greater importance, in a 
short time. 

The liors d'ceuvres are divided into two classes, hot and 
cold ones. To the cold ones belong, e.g., those radishes of 
which the aspect is the best part, for, as a French author 
says, their * verdeur ne convient pas k tous les estomacs.' 
The radishes are mostly accompanied with heaps of butter 
worked into fanciful shapes ; fillets of anchovies, with chervil 
and chopped eggs ; sardines ; marinaded tunny cut in thin 
slices, and garnished with green herbs ; olives in salt water 
(picholines) ; marinaded or pickled fruit and vegetables, or 
only green gherkins. Some eat melon, others fresh green or 
violet-red figs (which, however, are mostly reckoned to 
belong to the dessert). 

As oysters are apt to spoil the table linen, and make the 
hands of the diners salty, they are not given by some enter- 
tainers ; others give oysters, but change the table linen after 
them, which is very laborious ; others, again, serve them in 
a side room, where the guests take them standing before 
they go to the actual dinner-table. All these artifices 



MORS D'a:i i'RES, REMOVES, ENTREES 641 



destroy the unity of the dinner. Hence it is advisable to 
omit oysters from a formal dinner. 

The hot liors cVceuvres are distinguished by never having 
any sauce. Grillades of small charcuterie, truffled petty- 
toes, cotelettes de presale, grilled sheep's kidneys, are 
examples of ordinary hot hors d'oeuvres ; another kind are 
little pates, such as were formerly sold, and distributed in 
the streets of Paris in the same manner as muffins and 
crumpets are in London, but really hot, and served from 
portable ovens. Many persons give these little pates as 
the only kind of hors d'oeuvre. 

When the soup is removed, its place is taken either by 
fish, or in absence of that, or after it, by a large dish, or by 
several such dishes called the relevcs or removes. First of 
all releves is beef. That which comes from the bouillon, 
hence called houilU, is not served now at dinner ; it is 
replaced by larded fillet, or roast beef wath potatoes. Other 
releves are fish, e.g.^ carp, turbot, or any other sweet or salt 
water fish; calf's foot, or a chicken bedded upon (an otto- 
man of) rice, with only a little gravy, or rough salt, or 
tarragon. The distinction between certain releves and 
entrees is often arbitrary, so that at some tables one may 
have offered to one under the appellation of the former what 
othtr equally distinguished tables oiTer under the title of the 
latter. Further, some dishes are given in one place as 
releves which elsewhere figure as roasts, such as truffled 
turkey {vide supra, p. 490). 

The dishes preceding this course are considered prepara- 
tory, and the actual dinner is supposed to begin only with 
the dishes called entrees. These, then, are the first essential 
part of a dinner ; for there may be dinners without hors 
d'oeuvres, without soup, and even, or rather, of course, if 
there be no soup, without releves, but there cannot be a 
dinner without an entree. The recorded recipes for entrees 
are very numerous. A gastronomer of the name of Viard, 

41 



642 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



aided by one Fouret, has catalogued more than 900, and 
twice that number might be obtained by a careful scrutiny 
of culinary literature. 

There should be on the table, says the archimagirus, an 
entree of butcher's meat, one of fowl, one of fish, one of 
game, and one of pastry. The table covered with entrees 
should be a small representative image of the varied pro- 
ductions of nature and art. Out of four entrees two were 
formerly, as the ' Almanach ' has it, ' dedicated to trufHes ' ; 
one so treated was considered indispensable — ' dans tout 
diner un peu soigne.' 

By entrees are always meant ragoitts ; to give them variety, 
one half of them should be prepared with white, the other 
half with brown sauce ; one half should be garnished with 
vegetables, the other half should be provided only with 
gravy or sauce {jus ou conlis). 

The same production should not be offered twice, though 
in different form, at dinner ; if you had chickens in the first 
course, do not offer them in the second ; for an elegant 
service requires variety, and that afforded by mere variation 
of preparation is not great enough. If you have had soles 
an gratin, do not also offer them frites. If you had jugged 
hare, do not offer roast hare afterwards. But dressings or 
garnishes you may repeat on different materials. The^ 
service of entrees during the dinner should not be hurried, 
but each guest should have opportunity to eat of any dish, 
or of several preparations, as be pleases. 

Some fastidious culinary critics have raised the question 
wh ther the entrees should precede the relevcs or follow 
them; this is apart from the discussion of the absolute 
distinction between a releve and an entree. The question 
is shortly answered in this way, that as releves, in English 
reraoves or joints, are frequently roasted, it is preferable to 
place them before the entrees, so as not to let them be 
succeeded (in case they or one of them be roasted) by the 



SECOND SERVICE, ROASTS, ENTREMETS 643 



roast or roasts. It is therefore judged to be both *inteUi- 
gible and artistic' that the releve and the rot should be 
separated from each other by two hght entrees. 

Under the category of the roasts, the first division of the 
second service, are ordinarily comprehended, besides the 
real roasts, certain cold dishes, which might be ranged in 
a particular order, and large dishes to be placed at the ends 
of the table. Thus, it happens that salad passes often as a 
rot ; the same with 2^dtes de foic gras, and some fish fried 
or fish boiled blue ; crayfish, the langouste or iangostino, a 
large prawn, and prawns themselves, may be placed with 
the roasts or entremets. However, this always remains 
side-play ; the essential part of the service are the 2^ieces or 
joints of meat roasted on the spit or otherwise before tlie fire, 
or in the oven. In France the large joints of butcher's meat 
are preferred as releves, while in England they are preferred 
as roasts — e.g., roast beef, leg of mutton, loin of veal; on 
French tables the roasts consist of fowl or roebuck, red- 
legged partridge, and ever so many small birds, from becasses 
to larks, hares, etc. To this is joined a selection of fish 
cooked in court bouillon, or fried of a golden colour ; there 
are added terrines of Nerac, pates of Perigueux, Chartres, 
Amiens, or Strasburg. Along with the roasts are placed 
the entremets, and as there are mostly some impatient 
people at every dinner, these cause themselves to be served 
with the entremets while the principal joints are being 
carved ; but this interference is bad style, and is not to be 
recommended for imitation. 

At the time of the service of the entremets the convives 
do not any longer desire substantial dishes, but rather 
delicacies — fine and savoury vegetables well supplied with 
coulis, butter, or sugar ; a timbale of macaroni, sugared 
fritures, light pastry, perfumed creams or cream, like jellies, 
golden and trembling souffles, French or Eussian charlottes, 
pyramids of meringues, flans, etc., all so arranged as to 



644 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

please the eye as well as invite the palate. Such are the 
dishes of that part of the dinner, which may be called the. 
forerunner of tlie dessert. 

As regards entremets, cave must be taken that the cook 
do not prefer form to substance, and produce dishes under 
that name which, though good-looking, are of indifferent 
taste. This observation applies, e.g., particularly to those 
creams which are turned out of moulds, and consist oi' 
floury compounds with a little cream and much gelatine^ 
the jellies with rum or maraschino liqueur, the blane- 
mangers, and others which make a good appearance, but 
not rarely revolt the taste by their glutinous crudity. They 
are deteriorating daily, and mixtures are now sold which 
are pretended to produce, by mere solution in hot water,, 
many of the jellies of which formerly culinary art would be; 
proud as the result of a laborious process. But their taste' 
proves the great philosophical and culinary axiom that ex 
nihilo nihil fit. 

The third service is the dessert. After the entremets the- 
servants clear the table entirely, and then give to every 
guest a new but smaller cover, a knife and plate, and bring 
in the dessert. The fruit is arranged on green leaves recall- 
ing its former surroundings ; in winter the leaves can be 
replaced by elegant forestal mosses ; besides the fresh fruit 
is served the dried and preserved. Here also is the place 
for some cheese, Eoquefort, Cheshire, Stracchino, Stilton, or 
Gruyere. Almonds and nuts give some manual occupation, 
and while the wine circulates conversation becomes most 
animated. Now, also, is the time for a song or a recitation. 

The number of dishes to be given at dinners is determined 
by many considerations, but mainly by the number of diners. 
Experience has taught that for six persons the following 
dishes will be sufficient : a soup, a releve, two entrees, a 
roast, and four entremets ; for twelve to fifteen persons : 
six hors d'ceuvres, two soups, two releyes, four entrees, three 



DESSERT, NUMBER OF DISHES, GARNISHES 645 



roasts, and six entremets ; for twenty persons add a third 
more of the numbers given for fifteen. 

A false assumption of magnificence on the part of cuHnary 
authors shows itself in the recital of garnishes to dishes, only 
a small proportion of which is ever executed. On perusal 
of many examples, we find that the more indifferent are the 
materials of the dishes, the more laborious and expensive 
are the garnishes recommended to be incorporated with or 
added to them. Garnishes have many uses, e.g., that of 
increasing the nutritive value, or bulk, or sufficiency for 
service of a dish, which by itself would be insufticient ; 
thus, a chicken might not be sufficient for a carver to serve 
six plates, but when stuffed and moderately garnished it 
would probably be sufticient. Now, in all cases in which 
the original material, be it fish, bird, joint, or vegetable, 
is sufficient, a garnish can only be intended as a means of 
heightening the taste, but not as increasing the nutritive 
value of the dish ; in ail these cases it must be kept within 
the narrowest limits of quantity, and should never be applied 
as a means of merely impressing the eye. When, therefore, 
we give indications or hints for garnishes to many dishes, 
the readers should bear in mind that we do this only to 
assist them with suggestions to be used occasionally, but by 
no means to be regularly adhered to. On the contrary, we 
maintain that a well-cooked dish requires very few if any 
external additions. We do not underestimate the value of 
the external appearance of dishes, we also recognise that 
their appearance is of influence as regards their appreciation 
by gustation ; but no one can judge a farce by its looks, or 
a dish masked by a thick sauce by its garnish, and there- 
fore we advise our readers to bestow all care, in the first 
place, upon the taste and appearance of the prime material 
of the dish, before they expend any thought, material, or 
ilabour upon collateral objects, croustades, croutons, fleurons, 
quenelles, crayfish, cocks' combs and kernels, truffles, and 



646 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

all the useless so-called ornaments of the silver hatelets and 
trappings of an uneatable kind with which dishes are now 
so frequently overloaded. And we should, all the art of 
preserving notwithstanding, urge them to consult the seasons 
regarding the fruit which they bring forth, and use it while 
it be in season, and avoid the employment of materials oict 
of season, which are always purchased not only at the cost 
of quality, but also of money which might be employed 
more advantageously. 

There are some differences in the modes of serving dinners 
after the manner termed 'a la Frangaise' and 'd la Russe.' 
The French mode of serving a dinner consists in placing on 
the table all the dishes of a service, and then taking them 
away again in order to carve or to serve them ; the so-called 
Russian mode consists in either placing the dishes already 
carved upon the table (in which case an attempt is some- 
times made to cause the pieces to maintain the aggregation 
of their original parts, which is always diiScult and rarely 
successful), or in not placing the dishes on the table at all, 
but on the sideboard, and carving them there, and sending 
the carved pieces to the guests singly. 

In the discussion of these divergencies modern French 
cooks admit that both methods contain good elements which 
might be adopted, and bad ones which should be avoided. 
The service a la Busse is without question more expeditious 
and simple in its details than the old French service, which 
is frequently embarrassed and slow ; but it cannot be denied 
that this manner of carving everything beforehand * tends 
to destroy the fine art of decorating and dressing, in which 
so many of our most celebrated cooks have excelled, and, 
indeed, to extinguish with one blow the external appearance 
of our great French cuisine, that great development of taste 
and show which has given it a prominent position amongst 
all others.'* On the other hand, it is incontestable that 

* Thin quotation may be termed Goutie's lament. Cf. loc. cit., p. 344. 
Observe that in it he terms cookery a fine art. 



SERVICE A LA FRANCAISE AND A LA RUSSE 647 



there are grave inconveniences connected with the practice 
of having on the table for an indefinite time certain dishes 
which must lose their quahty if they are allowed to 
languish. Many of the products of cookery of the refined 
type require to be eaten immediately after they are done, 
in the condition which the French term a i^oini. If such 
dishes are allowed to remain on the table as part of its 
edible decoration, their essence — namely, their good taste — 
is given over to a false craving for appearances. 

But we believe that this possible deterioration of some of 
the more delicate dishes by delay of their consumption is 
only a minor one of the motives which have caused the 
service a la Busse to be preferred to that d la Francaisc. 
We believe that diners, hosts as well as guests, were tired 
of the overloaded, overgaiiiished, border-surrounded, skewer- 
impaled, and in many senses overvariegated and overtinted 
compositions, some actually called a la Harlequin, which, like 
the casts made of stearine and other materials, it was as diffi- 
cult to place on the table as to remove without causing some 
inconvenience to persons sitting at table. These composi- 
tions, moreover, involved an expenditure for which the mere 
view of their exterior was no equivalent ; also the outside 
was frequently so complicated that it did not allow of any 
visual diagnosis of the essence or corpus of the dish, and the 
exhibition was consequently a mere masquerade. 

As most cooks perceived that the French mode of serving 
dinner was no longer acceptable to many strata of the 
public, they endeavoured to save a part of it by a com- 
proniise, as some termed it, ' par une transaction.' Accord- 
ing to this, the table should be furnished and decorated with 
the larger cold dishes, which admit of that ornamentation 
so dear to some culinary spirits ; it should further receive 
the large removes and the hot entrees, which can generally 
be kept warm for some time on hot water or candle-warmed 
dishes without deterioration. In this wise the diners, on 



648 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



taking their places, would behold something more nutritious 
than flowers, compotes, fruit, and gilt bronces. At the same 
time, all preparations which require to be eaten a point 
might be served on flying plates {en assiettes volantes) without 
their having had the opportunity of pleasing the eye by 
their appearance before they were served. During the 
serving of these latter dishes the large dishes could be con- 
veniently carved, and thus the intervals between two courses 
could be abbreviated. (This would be a repetition, on a 
small scale, of the old Italian mode of serving, at great 
banquets, alternately a hot course from the kitchen and a 
cold one from the sideboard.) But this alleged abbreviation 
is a fallacy, as the service d la Bussc would still remain the 
shortest one, the large dishes not having to be removed from 
the table, and being in all other respects in the same position 
as those intended to be served in French fashion. 

Those who like the table to be well covered with showy 
dishes maintain that 'one eats with the eye also,' meaning 
that the sight of a dish proposed to be eaten is a pleasure 
or satisfaction. It is so as an assurance of the immediate 
realization of a desirable prospect. But the overdressed 
dishes to which we have objected are more apt to produce 
the feelings which w^ere roused in Sancho Panza's breast on 
the occasion of the feast by which he was deluded. If the 
service a la Francaise is to be continued in any form, the 
overdressing of the dishes will have to be omitted. 

A bill of fare, in French termed menu, is a culinary pro- 
gram, which has been arranged by the master or mistress 
of the house, or their deputy, mostly in consultation with 
the cook, has been carried out by the latter, and is laid 
before the diners at the table, in order that they may take 
their choice of the viands to be offered during the repast. 
With the French mode of service such a notice was less 
necessary than with the Russian, to which latter, indeed, it 
is indispensable. The greater the dinner and the more 



BILLS OF FARE, OR MENUS 649 

varied the fare, the more necessary becanie the hill or menu. 
Cooks are advised never to construct their bills too long in 
advance of the dinner, in order not to be obliged to alter 
them later on owing to the accident of the failure of this or 
that material. They are also advised never to let their 
menus be printed before they have got together all their 
necessary provisions, and are quite sure of their ability to 
carry out their program to the letter. 

Some authors give long series of menus as supposed illus- 
trations : ' Wyvern,' for example, gives most of his recipes 
as mere commentaries to exact bills of fare ; Simpson has a 
complete bill of fare for the table of a great house for every 
day of the year. Other authors give shorter or varied lists, 
from imperial and royal banquets down to philosophical 
tete-d-tetes under the patronage of the Muses, or even the 
Graces, or the god Amor himself. To most of them attaches 
a certain degree of interest, but for practical purposes they 
are of little use. They can hardly ever be copied, as they 
may be opposed by the changes of opportunities, seasons, 
materials, and special abilities of the cook, and, above all 
things, by that rarely ascertainable factor, the likings and 
dishkes of the master or mistress of the house, or even the 
divergences of the tastes of such nearly allied persons. For 
these reasons every bill of fare must be the result of the 
concurrence of all kinds of practical considerations, and 
should never be a theoretical prescription culled from such 
lists as have just been alluded to. K practical cook should 
have a reasonable choice of seasonable dishes of all the 
services, so to say, at his fingers' ends, not only as the result 
of training and practice, which might be unduly limited, 
but also as the result of the study of good works on cookery, 
and the exact sciences by which it is supported. 

The reader must take great care not to be deceived by 
spurious culinary literature, which even appears in volumes 
under grand titles. Careme, in his work 'Le Maitre 



650 THE SPIRIT OF COOI^ERY 



d'Hotel,' p. 31, states that the French work ' Les Soupers 
de la Cour ' was a mere exercise of the imagmation, and 
that the menus were never carried out. 

The objects for which menus are published in modern 
prints are mainly of an advertising nature. For a menu of 
the modern type conveys absolutely no information at all, 
as all will see who read our note on the ' Mutton Cutlets 
a la Maintenon' so called. Such publications of menus 
partake also of the feebleness ' de se donner par ecrit un faux 
air de magnificence.' If anybody were imprudent enough to 
try to imitate or carry out such a menu he would fail, and 
would soon range his judgment by the side of that of 
Careme on the * Soupers de la Cour.' 



CHAPTEE LX. 



CAMP COOKERY, OR THE COOKERY OF SOLDIERS 
IN THE FIELD. 

The cookery of soldiers in the field has always been a very 
elementary proceeding, and while all branches of military 
science had made great progress, the preparation of food 
during campaigns had rarely been scientifically treated or 
practically discussed ; it was supposed to be under the ban 
of immutable hindrances, and by this erroneous proposition 
bereft of the advantages of improvement. But quite lately 
the subject has been considered both in this country and in 
Germany in a highly practical spirit by several authorities,* 
from whom we derive welcome aid in the arranging of the 
results of our practical personal experience. 

In war more men are made useless or killed by disease 
than by either sword or projectile. The diseases which

COOKERY OF SOLDIERS IN THE FIELD 651 

affect the greatest number of victims are of the infectious 
and contagious kinds, and amongst these the most virulent 
and frequent are those which have their main seat in the 
intestinal canal, namely, enteric fever, or abdominal typhus, 
and dysentery. Healthy persons are the more liable to 
these diseases, the v^^orse is their state of nutrition, and the 
more predisposed, the longer they have to live on coarse, 
indigestible, badly prepared food, particularly in case they 
have already contracted a state of indigestion or enteric 
catarrh by such agencies. It is therefore of the greatest im- 
portance for the preservation of the health of the soldier 
that his food should be of good quality and well prepared, so 
as to be easily digestible, and that can be attained only with 
the aid of proper cooking. Food is nutritious only as far as 
it is digestible, and what is of doubtful digestibility had 
better not be eaten, as it is sure to cause disturbance. Food 
must also be tasty, for man, at least, is practically unable 
to eat of tasteless or bad-tasting food such a quantity as is 
necessary for the maintenance of his weight and strength. 
For a similar reason changes of food are requisite, for mono- 
tony in food also produces an aversion, which acts as a 
hindrance to the full satisfaction of bodily wants. These con- 
siderations, which are valid as regards mankind in general, 
obtain particular emphasis in the case of armies in the field. 
The German war of 1866, though very short, had never- 
theless a severe outbreak of cholera in its train. But the 
Franco-German war of 1870-71 was rela;tively free from 
epidemic disease. This is ascribed to the rapid and great 
success of the German armies, who cleared the land of 
soldiers, or confined them in the fortresses, and were then 
enabled to quarter themselves comfortably and live on the 
entire wealth of the fertile country, almost without native 
competition. While they were in the lines round Paris the 
provisions were sometimes scanty, as beef was failing owing 
to the cattle plague ; but the mostly excellent quarters 



652 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

admitted of careful preparation of the food, and there was 
no lack of good red country wine, and therefore disease had 
very little chance of spreading. It was different in the lines 
round Metz, w^here the soldiers had mostly to cook in the 
open air under the greatest difficulties, and were badly 
quartered ; here typhus and dysentery assumed towards the 
end of the siege threatening proportions; but as soon as, after 
the fall of Metz, the besieging troops marched towards the 
north of France and towards the Loire, they obtained good 
quarters and good supplies of food, and the infectious diseases 
disappeared. 

The ordinary coohing of soldiers in the Jield does not in 
any way satisfy the hygienic demands which we have for- 
mulated above ; on the contrary, it is so unmethodical that 
it forms a strange contrast to all the other well-arranged 
military proceedings. When the cooking-pits are dug into 
the ground, and the provisions are distributed, every mau 
pushes towards the lire and endeavours to find a place ; the 
sergeants no louger practise any kind of supervision ; a con- 
fusion arises which leads to deterioration and loss of food. 
Thus, a man cooking has just lifted up the cover of his tin 
pan, when another puts a handful of green wood under the 
pan, and causes thick smoke to impart its flavour to the 
contents of the pan. Another will take his kettle from the 
gallows on which three other kettles are suspended, and 
,does it so clumsily that all three kettles lose a great part of 
their contents. While one mau, whose kettle is boiling hard 
and running over, desires the fire to be less, his neighbour, 
who has only just arrived with a kettle full of cold water or 
other contents, makes as big a blaze as he possibly can. 
Most of the soldiers thus trying to cook have no idea at all 
of the manner in which the food distributed to them ought 
to be prepared. If at home they have perchance learned to 
boil potatoes, while they are with the regiment they learn 
nothing at all about cooking ; most of them take little trouble 



FAIL I ^RES OF COOKER ) ' IN THE FIELD 653 

about it. The meat, which, without having been beaten, is 
put over the fire in cold water, and ought to boil at least 
during from one and a half to tvv^o hours to become 
tender, is taken off the fire after half or three-quarters of 
an hour, w^hile it is yet quite tough and not half cooked, 
and is eaten in that state. It is neither of good taste nor 
easily chewed, and not very digestible, but healthy, strong 
men may overwhelm it (indeed, English soldiers object to 
tender beef, as I was informed by Captain Voyle) ; of these 
some fail occasionally to do so, and if they can afford it 
Ibiive to buy better fare at the sutler's w^aggon. 

In case Sbnj vegetables, other than potatoes, be served out, 
tor cereals like rice, barley, or grits, they generally catch in 
the kettles, acquire a disagreeable taste, and are thrown 
away. It has been calculated that more than half the 
nutritive value of the victuals distributed to soldiers during 
manoeuvres is lost by such negligence in the cooking. But 
in the field this practice becomes much worse, on account 
of the much greater fatigue of the men, and the loss is con- 
sequently much greater. If now there be no sutler from 
whom to buy supper for the evening and breakfast for the 
next morning, or there be no money, the soldiers will arrive 
starved and weak at the next bivouac, and if by chance 
they have to march further that night, will soon be in a 
state of complete exhaustion and inefficiency. 

The principal cause of the failure of all attempts to 
produce tolerable food in a vessel over an open fire is the 
endeavour to produce boiled meat, soup, and vegetables all 
in one and the same vessel. That the soup becomes too 
concentrated by long boiling would be remediable, or might 
be accepted as advantageous to its quality ; the meat also 
might be eaten underdone, or time given to it to become 
cooked ; but the vegetables or cereals placed in the kettle 
nearly always catch-, adhere to the bottom, become burnt 
in part, and then spoil the rest. For these reasons the 



654 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



cooking for each grouj) surrounding a fire sliould he effected 
in four dijferent kettles : in one the meat should he hoiled, in 
a second one the soup should he made, in a third kettle the 
vegetables sliould he hoiled, and in a fourth water should he 
heated to fill up the other vessels with, and rinse them after 
use. It follows from this that, as each man carries a cooking 
kettle, four men ought always to unite their cooking rations, 
and cook them together over one fire. If each attends to 
his kettle under the leadership of one, or of the sergeant, 
an excellent result can be attained ; when vegetables and 
cereals are boiled by themselves, they can be stirred, and 
their catcliing can be almost entirely prevented. A kettle 
in vvhich meat and vegetables boil simultaneously cannot 
be stirred ; on the other hand, preparations of cereals, 
rice, grits, barley, or leguminous seeds, must be stirred to 
prevent adhesion to the bottom and burning. If soup be 
made independently of the meat, the latter need not be 
boiled any longer for the production of soup, but may be 
grilled or roasted. Grilling small pieces of meat, or roasting 
larger ones, yields a tasty and digestible meal in a much 
sborter time than boiling, and enables the soldiers to obtain 
variety. 

Boasting on the spit, even an extemporized one made of 
wood, and turned on two forks fixed in the ground before 
the camp fire, can be very successfully employed for the 
cooking of beef, mutton, and veal. Pieces of veal or 
mutton of from four to six pounds in weight should have 
been killed at least forty-eight hours before. Larger pieces 
of beef should have been kept from three to four days, 
according to the temperature of the air and the season ; if 
they be used too soon after slaughtering, they will be neither 
tender nor tasty. Pork, however, can be roasted on the 
spit immediately after having been killed. Eoasts are 
particular conveniences to troops who remain stationary 
for longer periods — e.g., during sieges. 



PRE PAR A TION OF ME A T B^ ' SOLDIERS 655 

Soldiers should, before all things, learn the processes of 
firilling, frijinr/, and braising meat. The most convenient 
and quickest mode of preparing meat for grilling consists 
in cutting it into thin slices of the size of half a crown 
or a five-shilling piece, or into pieces of a cubical shape, 
and filing them on a long clean- shaved skewer ; some fat 
may be packed between every two slices, or placed at 
intervals. These slices, dusted over with a little pepper 
and salt, are now turned over, and ])efore a bright fire, 
and are done in less than a quarter of an hour. This 
arrangement is very commonly used in the Levant and in 
India, where these slices (most frequently of mutton) so 
filed, skewered, or spitted, are called kehohs or hhuhahs. 
In case the soldier have no skewer ready, and be pressed 
for time, he may file the khubabs on his sword or bayonet, 
protect the point of the arm and all bare steel with a 
potato, or some membranous offal, or a wet cloth, or a 
piece of oiled or greased paper, grill them for less than a 
quarter of an hour, and then take his cooked meat with 
him wherever his duty may call him. Such khubabs, made 
in the morning before the bivouac fire, may be carried as a 
provision for the day. Care is to be taken to obtain taste- 
less wood for skewers if no iron ones are at hand. Dry 
wood tastes less than green ; hazel-sticks have little taste ; 
beech-wood less ; fir-wood tastes resinous, but not very 
disagreeable. Such khubabs, or even larger pieces, may be 
fried with fat in the cover of the cooking kettle, particularly 
on live embers ; this has the advantage of yielding some 
sauce and fused fat, which can be eaten with the bread. 
Thus imnsteak is obtained ; by turning the slices of meat 
in flour, and then frying them, they become cutlets or chips, 
germanice Schnitzel. The meat may also be braised or 
steiued ; for this purpose it should be cut in slices, like 
khubabs, turned in flour, fried half-way in fat, and then 
some water, broth, or milk being added, it should be 



656 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

covered in the pan, and allowed to stew slowly on the 
embers. 

The process of meat preparation which demands the 
most time is boilinr/ in water, but it has the advantage 
that no fat is necessary to begin with. Freshly-killed beef 
is unsuitable for boiling, some parts, such as the brisJict, 
excepted, which can be boiled tender in two hours, 
provided it has been strongly beaten. All meat used 
in the field should be energetically beaten, as it becomes 
more tender and tasty by this bruising ; the beating should 
not be effected on small, but mainly on large pieces of meat. 
The effect of beating, in ordinary life, of meat before cooking 
is differently stated by different authors — e.g., Kitchiner. 
We ourselves believe that the effect upon the quality of the 
meat is inappreciable; the piece or slice, however, preserves 
its flat or square shape better when beaten, and is not 
bent, twisted, and crumpled up so much as when it is left 
unbeaten. 

In case the meat provided for the soldiers came from old 
or lean or freshly-killed animals, no beating or cooking will 
be able to make it tender. In this case there is only one 
process which will make the meat eatable — namely, mincing. 
In the minced state it can be quickly cooked, and requires 
little additional chewing ; it is also easily digested. The 
mincing is done with the sabre (a man may mince a pound 
of flesh in ten minutes), or, better, with a so-called sausage 
or rotary mincing machine. The mince may be stewed, or 
fried, or formed into balls and fried, and is then always 
tasty and digestible. As examples of the swiftness with 
which soldiers can prepare their meal with the aid of the 
mincing-machine, we quote the following facts from the 
Bohemian campaign in 1866 : At 10 o'clock two sheep were 
killed ; at 10.40 the last portion of meat had passed through 
the mincing-machine; at 11 o'clock it was eaten. At 
11 o'clock an ox was killed; at 1.30 the last piece of one 



Methodizing of camp cookery 657 

side, half the ox, was eaten. Two mincing-machines had 
been employed. 

Indeed, the mincing-machine is eminently useful in the 
field. All meat which it is dif&cult to prepare, or which 
takes much time for its preparation — c.r/., the neck, or the 
parts cut off the head (cheeks) — -when thus minced can be 
cooked in a few minutes. If a soldier finds that his meat 
has become too tough during roasting, or that it has not 
become tender during boiling, let him pass it through the 
mincing-machine, form it into rissoles, fry them, and in 
ten minutes he will have digestible, tasty meat. This 
mincing is also useful during bad weather, when fires will 
not burn, or when there is but little wood or a scarcity of 
water. On days of rest the mincing-machine may be used 
to transform meat into sausages, which may be kept ready 
against days on which cooking is difficult. 

During the siege of Paris the Germans had, on account of 
the rinderpest, no beef, but only mutton and pease-sausages, 
so-called Erbsivurst. They cooked the mutton in various 
ways, and ate it boiled, grilled, as cJioj^s and cotelettcs, roast 
on the si)it, as khubabs grilled and steived, and as mince ; 
they thus had daily variety for each week, and were fed 
admirably. 

It follows from all this that the cooking of the soldiers 
should be studied, organized, and, so to say, methodized, 
and secured by technical instruction and compulsory pre- 
scription ; above all, it should be purified of fundamental 
errors such as the following : 

Broth and soup in camp cookery have their uses. But 
military waiters on cookery still maintain, though without 
discussion, the fallacy of the usefulness of bones in the pro- 
duction of broth for soup. They say that broth is to be 
prepared from the bones and all other materials which are 
pared oli' the meat in its preparation for cooking. Such a 
process must of course yield a very variable broth, which, 

42 



658 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

however, in any case, can derive qualities essential to broth 
only from any meat, or actual muscular fibre, which may be 
contained in the parings. We therefore advise all soldiers 
who are desirous of cooking soup (while roasting or frying 
their meat rations) to proceed as follows : Firstly, avoid all 
and any bones, and thus never lose time or material in boil- 
ing them. Secondly, put into the kettle in which you want 
to make broth only meat, scraps, or slices, or hard and 
tendinous fleshy parts close to the joints, such as in ordinary 
life are judged to be uneatable, and regularly used as gravy 
beef only. Thirdly, mince such flesh very fine, and to a 
pound of it put a pint of water for strong, or more up to 
two pints of water, for weaker, but still very good broth. 
Fourthly, heat to ebullition, decant the broth to be further 
developed into soup if desired, and throw the exhausted 
mince away. Fifthly, never put any other materials, gristle, 
tendons, or parts of internal organs, with the meat for 
broth, as they are perfectly useless for the intended purpose. 
Sixthly, good broth or good soup being both agreeable and 
wholesome, make it directly by dissolving half an ounce of 
(Proust's) extract of meat in a pint of hot w^ater, or larger 
quantities in proportion. Such a pint contains the soluble 
ingredients of a pound of beef free from bone, fat, and 
gristle. With ceyetables, cereals, leguminous seeds, or bread, 
such broth will make an excellent, savoury and nutritious 
souj), to the effect of w'hich upon a hungry man in cold or 
wet weather nothing can be superior. Seventhly, the rations 
of every company should therefore include such a quantity 
of extract of meat in tin boxes or stone jars as will be suffi- 
cient for the production of such a quantity of soup as 
experience teaches will be eaten by soldiers when they can 
have it. Eighthly, such soup, with bread, can be produced 
quicker tho^n any other hot preparation of food, and with 
the addition of some fat becomes an almost complete and 
easily digested nutriment. 



ADVANCED CAMP COOKERY 659 

We will now cast a glance at a more advanced cookery for 
soldiers, tixocellers, sportsmen, geologists, miners, squatters, 
pastoral ranchers, and others. For all these remains abso- 
lutely valid all we have said on camp cookery for soldiers in 
the field. But as many of these persons have at their com- 
mand greater means of transport, and a greater range of 
materials, they are able to adopt somewhat more compli- 
cated processes, and to enjoy better and more varied fare. 
They may, e.g., carry with them a ijetroleum stove. There 
are many varieties and sizes of stoves heated by means of 
mineral oil, suitable not only for domestic, but also for camp 
cookery buch as is here to be considered. They are prin- 
cipally American inventions, but used largely on the con- 
tinent of Europe and in other parts of the world. They are 
cheap, portable, strong, and easily managed, fed with 
mineral oil, kerosene, or paraffin ; they are provided with 
arrangements for boiling, stewing, frying, grilling, and an 
oven for baking. A good practical stove with baking-dishes 
and a griddle, a radiator, a kettle, and a frying-pan can be 
bought for from £2 to £3. With such a stove the smaller 
ordinary saucepan may also be used ; a Warren's cooking- 
pot and a griller may be fitted to it for respectively £1 Is. 
and OS. 6d. W^hen it is not wanted for cooking it can be 
used for heating a room by the instrumentality of a so-called 
radiator or ornamental chimney. Thus adjusted it is also 
very useful for airing damp linen or drying wet clothes. 
Place a circular basket over it, and spread the things 
thereon ; the chimney being so contrived that the heat 
radiates laterally, there is no chance of burning, scorching, 
or smoking. 

In camp or kitchen the petroleum stove will boil water for 
tea or coffee, and milk ; it will bake bread for the breakfast, 
and cook any small dish besides. Similarly, it will cook the 
mid-day and evening meal. Of course, it cannot supply the 
power of a charcoal or wood fire, which may often be 



66o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



required besides ; but iu wet or stormy weather, or inside 
a tent, or caveru, cave, or rock-shelter, its advantages for 
cooking and baking are great. Its heat can be accurately 
graduated by raising or turning down the wicks, which are 
mostly two, each four inches wide. A gallon flask of mineral 
oil should be fitted into the stove-box. When used for some 
hours daily, such a stove consumes about two gallons of oil 
per month. 

Lamps hurning spirit, which can be purchased at prices 
not exceeding 6s., are a means of great comfort on a 
journey. In camp such a lamp will boil milk or coffee, 
cook eggs in several ways, heat sauces, fry bacon, etc. ; on 
the march it can be used immediately at the halting-place. 
By its aid and that of a small frying-pan one can devil a 
biscuit, fry a rasher, poach an egg, or cook a kidney to 
accompany tea or coffee ; even the frying of meat described 
iu the previous chapter can be carried out with such a 
lamp. It may be fed with spirit of wine ; in England 
methylated, or methylic, true wood spirit will have to be 
used. 

Concerning bread to he baked in camp in the petroleum 
stove, it may be pointed out that the dough should be made 
of good wheaten flour, salt, and water, and raised with 
yeast or baking-powder. For fancy rolls butter and milk 
will have to be added to the flour besides the raising agent. 
For eight ounces of flour two tablespoonfuls of baking- 
powder, or an ounce of compressed yeast, are requisite. 
When the dough is raised with baking-powder, care must 
be taken not to overwork the dough, and not to use too 
much liquid, and put it in the oven soon. When made with 
yeast it must be allowed to rise on a warm place for about 
an hour, and then be baked. If by mischance the dough 
have become too thin or liquid, bake it in a mould or tin. 

The utensU^ required for bread -makiiitj are a large 
enaiinelled iron (milk) basin, two wooden spoons, a flour- 



CAMP COOKING AND BAKING APPARATUS 66i 



dredger, scales to weigh the flour, some patty-pans for rolls, 
some small tins for the same, a baking-sheet, a half-pound 
and a pound loaf- tin, and a cake- tin ; these should be kept 
clean and reserved for their special purpose?, and never 
used for any other. 

With a small cooking apparatus it is advisable to make 
rolls rather than large loaves. Tf a roll be not eaten fresh, 
but allowed to become stale, it should be dipped in milk and 
put in the oven damp, when it will turn out again almost as. 
fresh as a new roll. In baking, be very careful that the flour 
be well sifted and thoroughly dry. In a moist climate like 
that of India it is advisable to dry it in the oven before 
using it ; the sifting must be done with a sieve, and it is 
necessary to protect the teeth of the consumer from particles 
of stone and gravel. 

Of souiis a great variety can be made in camp with the 
aid of (Proust's) extract of meat ; but in the absence of meat 
or its extract soupes maicires, or wafer soitps, can be made. 
Whenever there are sheep and fowls to be had, or game can 
be shot, or when tinned soups and preserved vegefables, 
especially the ' Julienne ' tablets, are obtainable, an excellent 
meal can be prepared. Tinned provisions, such as potatoes, 
carrots, and onions, and some tins with dried herb?, are 
eminently useful. Soups in tins can be freshened up by 
the addition of new materials, both of meat — e.r/., fowl — 
and vegetables. 

We have quoted from practical authors what we believe 
to be good advice, but we must oppose some statement 
made in connection with the discussion of camp-soups, 
namely, that valuable ' stock ' could be made from cold 
roast wutton hones, assisted by hacon sl^in, hones and trim- 
mings. We advise the culinarizing campaigner to cast 
bones, skin, and trimmings away, and not lose time over 
them. We also advise him to omit the frequent additions 
of brandy and several sorts of wine to all sorts of prepara- 



662 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



tions, which some authors declare to be mie qvd nous of 
their recipes. 

Preserved fish should be eaten cold, after all liquid has 
been drained away ; if it be desired to have it hot, it should 
be wa.rmed in a matelote, veloute, or other sauce, or grilled 
quickly in oiled paper. 

Tinned American or Australian meat is almost always 
overcooked, and on being warmed falls into fibrous masses ; 
if it be intended to eat such meat, it should be served cold. 
A very good part of the tin's contents is generally the gravy, 
which while cold is a jelly. If it be not eaten with the 
meat it may be melted, strained off, and made into soup. 
The meat, on the other hand, will thereby become rather 
flat; it maybe minced, exhausted with boiling water, and 
thrown away ; or the mince may be made into rissoles or 
pancakes, with additions, flavours, and spices."^ 

Tough meat may be made easily digestible by boiling it in 
water, passing it through the mincing-machine, and mixing 
it with dough about to be made into bread ; the dough 
digests the meat and causes it to dissolve : the result is meat- 
bread, which has been described above. A pound of flour, 
as dough, will digest half a pound of prepared meat. 

The messing of British soldiers has been much improved 
of late, particularly with regard to the utilization of the 
fat furnished in his rations. But the Memoranda pub- 
lished by the Army School of Cookery contain on p. 4 
the old fallacies about the stockpot and the boiling of 
bones. t On p. 8 we are informed that any system of good 
and economical cooking must be based upon the principles 

* More details concerning ' Advanced Field Cookery ' may be found in 
' Wyvern,' loc. cit., p. 314 ; this is treated more from the point of view of 
the sporting gentleman than the soldier, and with sole regard to India. 
Oti preserved soups and Australian meat, etc., cf. 'Wyvern,' lor. cit., pp. 322 
and 325. 

t The rules issued by authority for the Aldershot division say, p. 4 : 
' Half a hundredweight of bones, in addition to those removed from tlie 
ration meat, for .500 men should be sufficient to provide good soup.' 



IMPROVEMENTS OF SOLDIERS' MESS 663 



involved in the culinary motto of ' Skim, simmer, and 
scour.' This poetical conception faces a recipe for the pro- 
duction of brawn at a cost of IW. per pound, which will 
go far to make practica^ble the dream of a certain philan- 
thropist towards providing a dinner for the million at Id. 
apiece. For here a bullock's head and a set of cow-heels are 
made to yield 40 lb. of nutriment, and as the process is 
indubitable, we can only guess tliat the remarkable result 
is obtained by a massive hydration of gelatine, and that the 
product thus answers the purpose of moat and drink at the 
same time.

Acorned : mostl}' applied to pork, meaning «(:6>r«-y?^/— abbreviated, 
corned ; transferred to salt boiled beef, as corned or corn beef. 

Aillolis : a preparation of olive-oil or fat flavoured with garlic. 

Aitch-bone : part of the pelvic bone of the ox; when with flesh, a 
joint for cooking. The right mode of spelling this word is so 
difficult to find that Dr. Kitchiner avoided tlie decision by 
writing H-bone. In Mrs. Mason's 'Ladies' Assistant ' it was 
called haunch-bone ; in ' Domestic Alanagement,' and many other 
hooks, aitch-bone ; inRe3-nold's ' Cooker}-,' ische-bone ; in Hender- 
son's ' Cooker}-,' edge-bone; in Mrs. Lydia I'isher's 'Prudent 
Housewife,' ach-bone ; in Mrs. Mclver's * Cookery,' hook-bone. 
Kitchiner had also seen it spelled each-bone and ridge-bone, 
and heard it called natch-bone. We are inclined to believe Rey-

o{ ischiadic bone, the Mp-bone, more correctly ischion, the hip. 

AUemande : white veloute sauce, bound with yolk, and mixed with 
cream, flavoured with nutmeg and lemon-juice. 

Aloyau: French, loin of beef The undercut is termed filet dii

during four hours more. Success in the baking depends upon 
the previous beating. The name postilla seems to be the Latin 
adverb, used by Plautus and Terence, instead of posica, after, so 
that the v.diole indicates a dish of apples to be eaten after some- 
thing else. 

Aspic : French, a savour}- jelly, to be eaten by itself or with meat. 

Aspiquer: French, a modern Parisian culinarism, meaning to put 
lemon-juice, or 'reduced vinegar,' into a jell}-, a sauce, or a gravy 
(Gouffe); the expression is therefore misleading; the proper 
verb to use would be acidulating, to acidulate. 

Attereau, sometimes spelled hdit'rcau : a popular ragout at home

soups made by similar processes, i.e., soup-sauces, have also been 
termed so. 

Bisquotin: obsolete sweetmeat formerly made by nuns (D.D., 241). 

Blanc : French, a white mirepoix, consisting of fat, broth, and 
vegetables, for braising meat. 

Blanc-manger: originally a soup made of milk of almonds, con- 
somme of lean meat without vegetables, spiced with cinnamon 
and clove, minced and pounded roast fowl, or veal, and panada, 
etc., as stated in a recipe by Dr. Fagon given to Madame de 
Maintenon (see her letter). Nowadays a jelly made with calf's 
foot or gelatine and milk of almonds. Many modern recipes for 
blanc-manger are content with a mixture of milk and starch, 
which, when boiled and cooled, becomes an opaque jelly, properly 
called a Jtuuiiuerv. Others, again, destroy the character of the 
dish still more by adding colouring matters, such as chocolate or 
grenetine, barl)arisnis to be avoided. 

Blanch, to : to scald or parboil almonds to remove their skins, 
peels, or husks to make them white; extended to the scalding 
of vegetables which do not become white, though j^ale, and to

666 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Borage : French bourrache, Borago officinalis, L.. a plant with 
rono-h spiny leaves and blue flower, excellent for flavouring-

fication of the verb coraoo, ' I rejoice the heart.' 

BDUchee: a very small petit pate, so as to be a traditional motdhful

Chitterlings : plural of the foregoing ; signifies the boiled intestine 
or gut of the ox mainly, but also of calf and pig, the small tripe,

diminutive of cod = a pod containing seeds. Some surmise a con- 
nection with to coddle, to pamper, or to parboil, or soften by 
boiling Vv-ater, or say that an apple of any kind thus softened 
('intenerated') would be a codling. These apples are deprived 
of their peel only after having been parboiled in water, and are 
preserved in that state, and thus receive a treatment differing 
from that of other apples. Codled cream, or codlin creain, 
i.e., apple puree mixed with cream (apple fool), fits the meaning 
of cream mixed with codlin apples. Codling is also sipelled 
quodling, and, according to Jeaffreson {loc. cit., ii. 48), a recipe

of a rib ; a piece of meat with a portion of a rib attached, of 
smaller animals, calves, and sheep. The Anglicised form of 
the word is cutlet. 

Coulis : French, a strong, thick, savour}' sauce ; German, Grund- 
saiice, i.e., bottom sauce below the fat; lean sauce of a braise or 
blanc. Coulis was then used to denote a soup, and Anglicized into 
cullis. In ' Dons de Comus' coulis has three allied but distinct 
meanings: (i) that of a liaison of flour heated in fat, there- 
fore =roux [loc. cit., pp. 16, 24, 28); (2) purees of peas and lentils, 
etc. ; (3) thick soups and sauces. The word is now obsolete both 
in France and England, but persists in German writings of cooks 
who have inherite'd classical manuscripts. 

Crambambuli : a punch made from fired whisky and sugar fused in 
the flame. Perhaps derived v/ith the aid oi bainbalein, the Greek 
verb to stammer, as the drink is ver}- intoxicating. 

Crapaudine : French, a grating, gridiron ; hence mettre a la crapau- 
dine, to grill, e.g., pigeons. 

Crepine : French, kell, caul ; hence crcpinette, flat sausage wrapjjed 
in caul (diction ar}-), hence plural crepinettes, a ragout made with 
hashed meat placed in pieces of crepine. 

Croquantes : French, a bright mixture of fruit and boiled sugar. 

Croquants : French, confections giving the sound of crunching 
or cracking between the teeth. 

Croquettes : French, minced meat, coated with eggs and bread- 
crumb, and fried crisp ; almost the same as rissoles, but these 
latter bear their name from the rice which ought to be contained 
m them. 

Croustades: French, fanciful ornamental pie-cases, carved out of 
breadcrumb, and fried brown in fat. 

Croutons : French, sippets of bread, of various sizes and shapes, 
fried in butter, and used to garnish salmis, fricassees, dressed 
vegetables, etc., or to accompany soups, particularly of purees; 
also absurdly used for pieces of jelly placed round cold entrees 
{crouton ner, Gouffe, loc. cit., p. 351). 

Curry : a strongly-spiced ragout ; is derived from Old English cmy. 
See ' Forms of Cury,' where t^^ocury, or curry, powders are given, 
forte and douce. From these powders highly- spiced dishes 
derived their appellation. This roll of ancient cookery was com- 
piled by the master cooks of King Richard 11. , about 1390, and 
published b}- Robert Warner in 1791. Curries are therefore 
indigenous in England, and b}' no means an importation from 
Hindostan. The French speak of the supposed Indian dish as 
Kari a V Indienne. 

Custard : English, a composition of milk and eggs mainly, sweetened 
and flavoured, parboiled. Once spelled custade, a corruption of 
French crustade, a pie with a crust, from Old French croustade, 
from Latin crustatus, crusted (' Chambers' Etymological Dic- 
tionar}'). Custard is also a name sometimes given (in London) 
to a peculiar tropical fruit. 
Custard b.t^^\q% = costards, name proper of the apples; hence the 
seller of costards [i.e., apples) was called a cosiard-inonger, now 
degenerated to costermonger. 



670 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

Cutlet : English corruption of French cotelcttc, a small rib, or part 
of a rib. 

Cyder: vSouth-west English name of apple wine, which latter name 
prevails in the INIidlaVid Counties ; from zythos, Greek, an alcoholic 
liquid prepared by fermentation {q.v.). 'Chambers' Et3-niological 
Dictionar}-' spells cider, French cidre, and derives it from sicera, 
genitive ce, intoxicating liquor, from the GrQ^t^sikera. But cyder, 
at least, when 3-oung, is the least intoxicating of common fer- 
mented drinks, and therefore least liable to receive as specific 
name a general appellation. Cj'der is mosth' made from apples 
which are not eatable in substance. Its production is a German 
invention, according to Merat and Delens, ' Diet. Mat. Med.' 
Its Eatin name is poiiiaceum, made at a time when poniiini, 
originalh' signifying every kind of fruit — cherry, fig, date, nut, 
even truffle and grape — had been specialized for inalum (of Greek 
origin), apple ; but this name included in its turn pomegranates, 
peaches, oranges of all kinds, lemons (pomecitrons), and quinces, 

D 

Darioles : French, pastry of entremets, constructed like English 
cheese-cakes. 

Darn: English sul)stantive, a slice or cutlet, e.g., a transverse chop 
of fish, such as salmon or cod. The term is in ' Smith and Hamil- 
ton's English-French Dictionary,' and was used freely by cooks of 
the last century. English form of the French dame, substantive 
feminine, a slice (of some fishes only, but varieties not specified). 

Daub : English, daube French, culinar}- term for stew ; thus, gigot 
h la daube^lcii, of mutton stewed. The French word dauber has 
no culinary application. [In Francatelli, 570, and other places 
lo daube (with the final e) is used as equivalent to larding, or, as 
this writer also has it, interlarding (a confusion with a literar}- 
tropic). The English expression is to daub, without the final e. 
Thus we have (vSimpson, p. 337) daubed fozcls, which are braised, 
and not larded; and (ibid., p. 33S) we have Fowl a la Daube, 
larded, which is to be finished like FoiVl a la Daube (p. 29), which 
is not larded. vSimpson (p. 76) has Rump of Beef a la Daube, the 
recipe for which begins thus : ' Trim a rump of beef, take the 
bone out, daub it {i.e., the rump, not the bone), and put it into a 
marinade.' Here to daub must mean to lard it. See also id. 
ibid., p. no, wiiere rump of veal is to be daubed the same as 
rump of beef Daubing must be a particular kind of larding, 
with thick lardoons, for Simpson describes only beef and veal as 
daubed, fovrls, etc., alwa3's as larded. (vSee also loc. cit., p. 112.) 
Dinde en Daube (Beauvilliers, i. 348) is larded with aromatized 
lardoons. 

Daubiere: French, a vessel in which joints or birds are to be 
daubed or stewed. 

Dress, to: to bring a matter into good form, to clean, trim, etc. 
Dressed vegetables are samples of the particular form implied. 

Dunelm : a kind of dish of mutton, or other meat, possibly local to 
Durham (Dunelmensis ?). Dunelm of veal : viae 'Eaton's Dic- 
tionary.' 



DICTIONARY OF CULINARY TERMS 671 



Duxelles (Z^'6^.^-^//^^): name of a French marquis who lived at the 
end of the seventeenth centur}^, and whose ecuyer de cuisine 
was De la Varenne, author of an excellent cookery-book (1699). 
D'Uxelles also means a special preparation oi mince. 

E 

Eclanche : French, shoulder of mutton. 

Edge-bone. See Aitch-bone, supra. 

Entrees : French, conventional term for hot side-dishes, which 
accompany or follow the soup and releves ; also defined as all 
hot dishes which are eaten with a sauce — e.g., cutlets, fricassees, 
fricandeaux, fillets, kebobs, salmis, boudins, sweetbread, pates- 
chauds, chartreuses. Cold entrees ma}^ include fricassees, salmis, 
cutlets, ham, tongue, fillets of game, poultry, fish, aspics, salads 
of poultr}-, fish and shellfish, boar's head, potted meat. Appro- 
priate for cold collations. Some French cooks refuse to term a 
cold dish an entree. 

Entremets, or second course side-dishes, to accompany the roasts, 
include the just named cold entrees ; dressed vegetables, scolloped 
shellfish, and dressed eggs, and the infiniteh' varied and variable 
sweets, consisting of puddings, cakes, timbales, sweet croquettes, 
charlottes, croquantes, pastries, jellies, creams, fritters, etc. 

Epanada: South Spanish and I'ortuguese for panada {q.v.). 

Epigram: Knglish, epigrauiuic French, name of dishes not defined, 
of ancient use. 

Escabecher : to cure sardines, then other fish ; English, to cabeach. 

Escallope : French, scollop English, obsolete cascalope ; originallv the 
large edible shellfish in the'beautiful ribbed deep shell with a flat 
cover; metaphorically, something ediljle placed into and hotted 
in such a shell used as a dish ; then lumps, or slices, or dice of 
any meat; scollops, synonym kollops, then in Germany degenerated 
to a name for mince of ail kinds of meat, called Klops. 

Espagnole : French, the main or grand brown sauce from which 
most other brown sauces are made or theoreticall}' derived. 



Fancbonettes, also spelled fanchonnettes : French, small cakes 
covered with meringue froth; same asjlorentines. 

Farc3 : French noun, from the participle farsuni of the Latin 
verb favcio, farcire, to stuff, to fill (so as to make full), fill 
up, to cram, for fattening, e.g.. chickens. From this is derived 
farciiucu, the sausage ; secondarih', fineh^-minced meat, fat, 
bread, auvl spice, or sausage meat for stuffing birds, filling raised 
pies and gratins; Ji,\\^\\s\\ corrxv^tion forcemeat — viande fa7cee, 
also — cooked sorrel. CEufs a la /arce=ha.rd eggs with sorrel 
stewed. Thus farce may but need not contain any meat at all, 
and may consist of spiced panada with egg liaison. The English 
forcemeat therefore involves a widening of the definition which 
makes the presence of meat essential. Forcemeat balls are in 
French termed bouleties de hachis. 

Filet : French, the undercut of the loin (psoas muscle) of oxen and 
venison; breasts of fowls and game when cut out; the outer

roundish pieces cut out of meat or fowls; masses or stripes 
of flesh cut out of fish ; longish strips of any material, roots, 
nouilles, etc. In English culinar}- books spelt fillet. 

Fine herbs : a mixture of tarragon, parslex', chervil, shallots, 
chives, basil, and mushrooms chopped and sweated in fat; 
practically, and in recipes, it means parsle}- onl3\

Flans : French, varieties of cakes, resembling cheese cakes in con- 
struction.

nearl}- done, each cake is dipped into a hot S3'rup of sugar and 
water in equal parts, and then completely dried in the oven. 
They keep for a long time. 

Fleurons : French, punched-out ornaments of bread, crust or fried,

flavourings; Spanish fliunincry, of cream, rice flour, cinnamon, 
and sugar, to be eaten Avith sweet preserves. 

Fond: French, the broth or juice of flesh which has been cooked 
in a braise ; may be, and mostly is, served as sauce ; may be 
passed through tammy, separated from grease, thickened with 
roux. The juice of fish similarly obtained is called fish fond. 

Fondu : French (Careme writes fondn, and others spell fondue), a

DICTIONARY OF CULINARY TERMS 673 

Frumenti : corrupted synonym fiiruicnti, also Jinniiy (Somerset- 
shire finnity, 'Eaton's Dictionar}- '), a food eaten warm or 
cold, made of wheat, boiled in milk to a jelh- ; later currants, 
sugar, 3'olks, and spice are added. Old French y;'cww^;//^'= boiled 
wheat, or boiled corn of any kind; from \^?i\X\\fruineiitum, grain. 
The limitation to wheat is very late. In this coiinection it 
should be remembered that fruf/ien (Ivatin) signifies a. paste, grueU 
or better porridge. 

Fumet: French, an extract of game, or an}- peculiarly flavoured 
substance used to impart the flavour to other dishes. [Also a 
ragout of partridges and rabbits braised in wine ; this exceptional 
meaning (D.D., 580) should be expunged.] 



Galantine : a fowl boned and stuffed with pieces of meat and farce, 
and garnished with jelly or aspic. 

Galima'fre (D.D., 585), or Galimafree (thus Heyse, 'Etvmol. Diet.'): 
name of a ragout, made of so-called offal or remains of meat with 
certain flavourings. Origin of word unknown. Tropically = con- 
fused speech, unintelligible mixture. (See Galimafree of Sheep's 
Head and Pluck under Preparations of Mutton.) 

Garbure : French, originall}' a soup of cabbage and bacon. Several 
garbures, with turnips and other vegetables, are mentioned. In 
'Man. d. Aniphit.' a number are named, e.g., p. 215, an fromage. 
'Garbure came from Spain to France, where it was best made 
in Languedoc, and frequently used ; the addition of (Parma) 
cheese introduced an Italian element, and the preparation thus 
represents a triple alliance in a soup-dish' ('Man. d. Amphit.,' 
p. 217). 

Gargotage: French ^ill-dressed victuals. 

Gargote : small or bad cookshop. 

Gargoter : to frequent small or low eating-houses. 

Gargotier : keeper of a cookshop, also a bad cook. The root gargot 
is supposed by some to be derived by corruption from the German 
Garkoch, a cook and vendor of read3--cooked viands. 

Garnish, to: English, French ^t7;7//;', ttdiWan guarnire, to ornament 
or adorn, to add something which will make the thing which is 
garnished look better or more pleasing. 

Garnish : English, the thing added to a cooked article on a plate 
ready for being presented to the diners, in order to surround, 
support, or adorn it. The word is now frequentl}- used in 
culinar}' works to signify vegetables added to preparations in 
course of cooking for the purpose of imparting flavour. A garnish 
may but need not be eatable — e.g., the parsley round cold meat. 
A frequent garnish to ragouts are sippets of toast, which have the 
advantage of sucking up sauce, whence their name ; a more 
accomplished form of these sippets are the croiitons, or sippets 
fried in fat, perhaps the garnish most frequentl}- used by Italian 
and French cooks. Cocks' combs are a garnish frequenth' used 
in ragouts ; small iwiishrooDis, and roots carved in fanciful shapes, 
are also amongst the garnishes.

674 THE SPIkIT OF COOI^ERY 

Garum: Latin, a sauce celebrated amongst the Romans, made of 
lish, to be eaten with fish. The descriptions of garum which 
have been preserved are ver}- imperfect, so that if we had to 
adopt their usual interpretation, the sauce would be rather the 
reverse of a delicac}'. Rumolir {loc. cit., p. 4) thought garum a 
relative of soya (Indian or Japanese so}-), a mistake probably 
transferred from an annotation of Lister to Apicius, and repeated 
^b}- Brillat-Savarin (see supra, p. 519 et seq.). 

Gateau: French, essential!}* a butter-dough cake {cf. La Chapelle, 
loc. cit., ii. 176). 

Gaufire: French, waffle English, from Old French, waufre, wafre, 
wafer; from German, Wabe, honeycomb ; a light, thin sort of cake 
arranged in cells, fried in an iron mould consisting of two 
opposed plates worked by handles. 

Gibelotte : French, stewed rabbit exclusiveh'. 

Giblets: English, irom. gi bier, ¥rQnch= gaiiie; from Gothic ^7<^/<?, a 
wing, meaning the trimmings and inside of a goose; applied to 
parts of other birds also. 

Giblet pie : a pasty of inside and trimmings of goose ; extended to 
pies containing offal of other birds. 

Gimblettes: French, pastry of the kind called small, or, in French, 
de petit four [cf Croquignoles and Croquembouches). 

Glace, also spelt glaze and glaize : a concentrated sauce which, 
when poured over cooked meat, will adhere to it, give it a 
shiny appearance, and will also keep it moist. Such sauces were 
produced by cooks b}- evaporating so-called stock — i.e., broth 
containing much gelatine — and letting it set; it was added 
largely to soups and sauces. It is less essential since the dis- 
covery of Proust's extract of meat. Glace must be browned, and 
in the browned state was also called caramel: 'Caramel ce que 
Ton appelle glace ' (La Chapelle, ii. 94). 

Glaced : applied to an3-thing iced, or, figuratively, anything having a 
smooth, glossy surface from the application of glace, or of sugar, 
or of gelatine in various forms. 

Godiveau: French, a kind of mincemeat or farce, of which balls are 
formed, with which the interior of hot pates and vol-au- vents are 
garnished. There are several varieties ; origin of name not stated 
(D.D., 609). The terminal veau suggests a connection with veal, 
its main ingredient. 

Gooseberry : from Old French groiseh\ Scotch grosart, Old German 
Krus, crisp, or curled, from the hairs with 'whicli the common 
varieties are covered. Another derivation is from gorse, the 
spiny Ulex europcens, furze or whin (Jeaffreson, loc. cit., ii. 214); 
but this is improbable [cf Groseille a maquereau, infra). 

Gooseberry fool is gooseberry puree mixed with cream. The word 
fool is an abbreviation of the French foulc, pressed or crushed ; 
the admixture to the fruit puree may also be milk. It is curious 
that, although many such mixtures of fruit puree with cream are 
used, the \\'6.n\^ fool should only be applied— at least, commonly 
— to the preparation of gooseberry {cf Cod led Cream, voce 
Codlin). 

Gratins: French, soups and sauces consolidated by dry heat round 
spongy objects — e.g., crusts of bread, or ganie, poultr}-, fish. 



DICTIONARY OF CULINARY TERMS 675 

vegetables, macaroni, etc. ; the objects are covered with pulveru- 
lent bread and minced vegetables to increase the surface for the 
absorption and concentration of the gravies. Originally, gratin 
meant the burnt (browned) part of rice ; an gratin, a dish so pre- 
pared as to be similarly browned. 

Gratinate, to : to bake, fr}-, and brown a dish while it is surrounded 
b}^ savour}' juice which concentrates upon it, and acquires a 
crisp surface. 

Grenade, also called granada : a dish of German origin, imitation 
of the hand-thrown bomb invented at the Spanish town of that 
name. 

Grenadines : French, diminutive of the foregoing ; misapplied to 
fricandeaus, dishes on a basis of forcemeat. 

Griskin: English, back or loin of pork, 

Grondin : French, gurnard, gurnet (fish). 

Groseille a maqnereau: French name oi gooseberry, proljablv derived 
from circumstance of unripe gooseberries having been placed in 
ragouts, particularlv of fish, to heighten their taste (' Diet. Mat. 
Med.,' art. 'Ribes')' 

Groute, de la; French, a dish which the Lord of Addington (now 
the Archbishop of Canterbury) has the privilege of presenting to 
the King of England at his coronation iDanquet. 

Gruel: English, from French gruau, Latin grutuui, grntullenin, 
oatmeal boiled in water. 

Gulasch, Hungarian : a ragout of rumpsteak flavoured with pabidca 
[niild capsicum). 

H 

Haddock ; English name of a fish ; in culinary French aigrejin, 
aiglefin, merluche. 

Haggis: Scotch, minced meat, etc., steamed; from hag, Scotch, to 
chop ; German Hacken, hence Hackjieisch ; French hachis. 

Haricot: as applied to stewed meat, probably a contraction for 
/m///-rrt'^6'/'^/; corrupted s3'nonym /mrrzVc (' Eaton's Dictionar}'). 

Harslet, pig's: English, hasla in Icelandic; s3'non)-m haslet, the 
inside organs of a pig; also their best parts, liver, sweetbread, 
and small pieces of flesh, prepared and spiced, enclosed in a 
cawl or caul, roasted, and eaten with a sauce. 

Hart of grease: a fat hart or stag in full season, with three inches 
of fat on the brisket. 

Hatelet (attelet) : French, a kind of skewer of metal, preferably 
silver, which is stuck through roots, truffles, cra3'fish, etc., and 
fixed on large dishes, joints, entrees, etc. ; perhaps from hastida, 
dim. of hasta, lance. 

Hatereau : French. See Attereau, supra. 

flateur de la bouehe du Roy : anciently, overseer of the roast meat of 
the French King's household (Dictionary). 

Hatier : French, spit- rack. 

Hors d'ceuvres: French, all dishes which, without being themselves 
sufficient to constitute a substantial meal, are yet served b}- 
themselves on plates of a particular form, and complete the 
elegance of the table (D.D.). Hot hors d'ceuvres are verj- light 
entrees, such as patties of all kinds, rissoles, croquettes, minced 



676 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 



fish, scolloped shellfish, macaroni, poultry, game, sweetbread, 
brains, ox-pith, horlys of fish, poultry, or game. Cold hors 
(Vcenvres are eaten immediately after the soup and fish, and 
consist of sardines, anchovies, tunny, Dutch herrings, savoury 
butter, oysters, oiled salads (Francatelli). 
Hotchpot: Scotch dish of mutton, corrupted to 'hotch-potch,' 
and further to ' hodge-podge ' ; from French hoche-pot. The 
novelist R. D. Blackmore, in 'Kit and Kitty,' p. 282 (1890), has 
the following statement : ' " It (Hotchpot Hall) taketh its name," 
says an old count}- book, "from a very" ancient rule of law, that 
if sisters be in coparcenar}', as heiresses to landed estate, and 
one of them has from the same source a several estate by franc 
marriage, she shall (as is just and seenil}^) bring that into hotch- 
pot, which signifieth a mixture for a pudding, ere ever she can 
enjoy rights with the rest." ' 



Ische-bone. See Aitch-bone. 

J 

Jacobins : nickname of quenelles of custard which became fashion- 
able during the Revolution ; after the restoration their name was 
changed to Royals. 

Jardiniere : French, a preparation of mixed vegetables, stewed in a 
sauce, with savoury additions ; also a souj) with the same. 

Julep : ancient Arabian name for a calming drink, containing 
mucilage and opium ; possibly connected M'ith the Persian and 
Arabian name of the bulbs of orchis — salep, sahhleb, salap, or 
Salop (spelled saloop in 'Eaton's Dictionar}- ') — which yields a 
mucilaginous infusion [satyrion of the ancients). 

Jumbles : under this name pass confections of varying degrees of 
complication, as the name, signifying cojifiised mixture, seems to 
indicate. Early in the present centur)^ jumbles were thin cakes 
made of equal parts of flour and sugar, with a little 3-olk flavoured 
with rose-water and lemon-peel. The paste, cut into fancy shapes 
(hence perhaps the name), was baked on tins until the edges began 
to brown. In London, during the nineteenth century, jumbles 
were sweetmeats much coveted b}- children, represented by thin, 
semi-transparent, crisp, fragile, brown, rolled-up or conically- 
bent leaflets, having the appearance and taste of rolled-out 
butter - scotch. In this popular confection a degradation is 
perceptible, inasmuch as frequently it is no longer crisp and 
vitreous, but flexible, viscous, and sticky to the fingers. Almond 
jumbles are little cakes made of flour, butter, sugar, almonds, 
yolk, and cream, flavoiired at pleasure, iced with sugar and white 
of egg, and baked. 

Junket: English, hot milk curdled with rennet, sweetened with 
sugar, flavoured with brandy or whisky, and enriched with 
Devonshire clotted or with whipped cream. Eventualh^ junket 
is a preparation of curdled milk, or curds, which are placed upon 
rushes {ha.tin j'uncus) to allow the last portion of whe3'to percolate 
and become absorbed. Junket has also been defined as any 
sweetmeat carried in little baskets made of rushes; also used 



DICTIONARY OF CULINARY TERMS 677 

metaphoricalh', in rustic humour, for a stolen entertainment; 
made into a verb, infinitive to junket— i.e., to feast in secret. 

Jus: Latin, also French, broth, soup, juice, grav}-. On the distinc- 
tion between 7«^ and honillon, see ' Dons de Comus,' i. 14. 

Jusculum: Latin, broth, juice, gravy, perhaps sauce; diminutive, 
therefore signifying a special sauce of quality. 

K 

Kadgiori, or kegeree, or kiichri : East Indian preparation offish. 

Kebobs, or khubahs : Turkish, Indian, dice of mutton run on a 
skewer, and grilled or cooked in other wa3's. 

Ketchup : English, liquid extract of mushrooms. ' The liquor 
obtained from mushrooms approaches the nearest to meat grav}- 
in flavour and quality of any vegetable juices, and is the best 
substitute for it in any of those savoury dishes intended to please 
the palate ' (' Eaton's Dictionary '). Explicit recipe, see ibid. 

Kitchener : a cook ; lately also applied to cooking apparatus. 

Kneffs in German, qneneffes or quenelles in French {cf. Knodel, 
itijra): little savoury soup-dumplings; perhaps from Greek 
knesDia, that which has been rubbed or scraped off, forcemeat 
being mostly rubbed as puree through a tammy, and scraped off 
on the other side ; from Greek knan, to scrape, etc., or knesmee, 
scraped meat simph'. 

Kni)del : Bavarian German for dumplings ; Knopfle in Suabian. (La 
Chapelle, v. 224, spells cnoedels.) 

Kouques : French, rarely used ; adopted from German Kuehen, or 
English cakes. Kouques a VAnglaise were much favoured. 
Carenie gives sixteen dishes of pastry coming under the head- 
ing of couques, to be used at soirees, thee dansants, where they 
were much patronized. 

Kromeskys, variation kramouskys, are forcemeat balls wrapped in 
cowl (net, omentum), and fried in fat, or in braised calPs udder, 
cut in thin slices, immersed in butter, and fried in hog's lard ; or 
in little jackets of fat bacon, previously' cooked, and cut in thin 
slices ; such rolls are dipped in batter and fried. The name may 
have some connection with the Greek kroniyon, onion, particu- 
larly as kromeskys are said to come to us by way of Russia, 
hence termed a la Russe. Careme repeatedly writes cremeskis 
(' M. d'Hot.,' p. 310 and p. 339). 

L 

Langouste : French, spiny lobster, sea crawfish. 

Langostino : a peculiar prawn from the Atlantic, near Cadiz. 

Lapereau : French, young rabbit, cony; Oe:Trr\.a.n Katiinchen. 

Lapin de Garenne : wild or warren rabbit, as distinct from the lapifi 
de clapier, hutch or tame rabbit. 

Lapins en accolade: a brace of rabbits alongside of each other on a dish. 

Layer : a marine alga, growing on rocks along the shore in the 
West of England ; is prepared in pots and sent out for eating. 
Its immediate preparation consists in the addition of butter and 
Seville orange jviice, and in heating over a spirit lamp with 
stirring. It is eaten with roast meat ; seldom liked at first, by 
habit becomes highly agreeable (' Eaton's Dictionary ').

Legumes : French, the grains which come in pods, and are collected 
[lego, I collect) by hand: peas, lentils, beans, haricot beans, etc. 
(falsel}- applied to all kinds of fruit, roots, stalks, leaves, which 
serve for nourishment, or to green herbaceous vegetables). 

Liquamen : Ivatin for broth or juice (Columella and Paliadius). 

Liquameatum : the same as liquamen (Vegetius). 

Liquaminatus : provided or mixed with broth (Apicius 8, 7). 

Liquaminosus : full of broth, juicy (Marcus Kmpiricus 5, ext). 

Liquo, liquare : to make fluid, fuse, melt ; to filter ; to clarif}' 
wine ; to purif}^ {^-g-i liquata vox, pure, clean voice) ; to ex- 
tract. These words are here interpreted with reference to 
Hqimmen, which may have been, or have contained, an}- kind of 
meat-broth, and we doubt very much whether, as some com- 
mentators have supposed, it ever meant garuni, except in con- 
nection with preparations of fish. Garum {ij.v.), however, was, 
of course, a liquamen. 

Loin is (the half of) the lower part of the back of a beast cut up for 
food, one side of the loins ; this plural is synonymous with that 
of the reins, or parts of the back behind and below the kidneys. 
Old French logne, French longe, Latin lumbus, a loin, one 
side onl)'. Lumbi are the loins, the thick part between the 
gluteal region and the back. Psoa — x^^xow of loins or kidneys ; 
includes i\\^ psoas muscle, in front of the spine (fillet or undercut). 

Luting : a paste made of flour and water, and used for fastening 
the lids of stewpans or other vessels, to make them somewhat 
better fitting, and diminish evaporation. 

M 

Macaroni : sometimes spelled luacarolli (La Chapelle, i., p. 6). 

Mactdoine of fruit: is a sweet jelly with whole fruit in its sub- 
stance. 

Macedoine of vegetables : is a jardiniere or mixture of several vege- 
tables, cooked, with some white sauce added. 

Mackerel : a fish ; name from Latin maciilarelli (little spots) ; 
French maquerean. 

Madeleine : French, a particular kind of cake : madeleines of 
Commerc}- have a great reputation. 

Magira : Latin, the art of cookery ; from Greek inageira, viagirus, 
cook ; Diagirium, kitchen or cooking vessel ; related to rnao, 
mago (Greek), I knead ; hence magma, dough, paste. 

Marmelade : originally the Spanish name of the jam of the flesh of 
quinces [marmelas in Spanish), which, when solid, is called 
quince cheese; then, transferred to other jams, e.g., what ought 
to be called orange jam, is affectedly called orange marmelade. 

Matelote : a dish of fresh-water fish, sometimes of one kind only, as 
of eels ; sometimes of several kinds mixed. 

Mayonnaise : an emulsive sauce, made of yolks and oil ; s)'nonyni 
magnonnaise, also bayonnaise (conjecture of the 'Man. des 
Amphit.,' p. 157) ; also said to be a corruption from mahonnaise. 
Magnonaise is the oldest spelling we have met with. 

Mazarines : ornamental entrees made of forcemeat, with fillets of 
meat {cf. Grenadines).

Mead : Knglish, iMeth Gerinan, an alcoholic drink prepared from 
honey boiled in water, flavonred with herbs and malt, fermented 
with yeast, spiced, and matured by keeping. Sometimes hops 
were added to the mead. 

Meringues : light spongy cakes or confections, made of sugar and 
white of egg froth, mostly filled with whipped cream. Derived 
from Merovingians, the Franconian kings preceding the Karo- 
lingians. 

Merlan : French, whiting (fish). 

Merluche : French, haddock. 

Mignonette pepper : a form of comminuted pepper, from either 
white or black pepper-corns, which, after being broken so as to 
resemble mignonette seed, are sifted to remove fine dust. 

Mirepois, Mirepoix, la : French, a compound sauce for braising 
meat, originally imagined by the Marechale de Mirepoix, ' who ' 
(says ' Man. d. Amph.,' p. 165), ' as regards gourmandise, but 
gourmandise onl}-, was almost the second volume of the Mare- 
chale de Luxembourg.' Mirepoix, with poels and blajics, belong 
to the category of braises. 

Mirlitons are tartlets with a basis of puff paste, constructed like 
cheese cakes, witli the cheese left out. IMMitoji means a reed- 
pipe, and has therefore a metaphorical significance. Related to 
flans. 

Mirotott : French, boiled beef smothered in onions; misapplied to 
an arrangement on a dish, e.g., cotelettes, or fish fillets, laid in a 
circle, so that one half of each covers the other half of the next 
one, while the central space is occupied by a sauce or a ragout ; 
this is called en miroton. 

Mitonnage : the art of simmering broth and its ingredients. 

Mitonner : French, to simmer, soak, stew. 

Mousseron : French; niushrooni English; signifies in French a 
particular kind, in English a generic term. 

Mull, to : practicalh' means to heat and spice, particular^ zuine, 
e.g., sherry or chiret ; it is supposed to be derived from the Latin 
inollio, I soften, make milder ; it therefore includes the sweeten- 
ing of acid and the diluting of alcohoHzed wine. 

Mallet, red : English ; in French ' rouget de V ocean ' and woodcock 
of the sea. 

Mumbled hare: English, minced cooked hares' meat, flavoured, 
salted, spiced, and acidulated, put into a stewpan with a dozen 
eggs, a pound of butter, and cooked to point, with constant 
stirring ('Eaton's Dictionary'). 

N 

Norfolk dumplings: English, often called drop duniplins, or spoon 
dumplins, because the batter of milk, flour, eggs, and salt is 
dropped into boiling water from a spoon. They are now often 
fermented, or raised with baking powder, and are much used in 
the count}' of Norfolk and neighbouring districts. 

Nougat : French (perhaps meaning nut cake, from Jioux and 
gdteaii), a mixture of almonds and honey baked together. 

Nouilles : French, a kind of vermicelli or macaroni to be made in the 
kitchen. German iVndeln, q.v. ; Taillerins, La Chapelle, i. 7.

O 

OUa : Spanish ragout (falsely called po hi da), on which see text. 

Omelette : also spelled ainne'lette^ e.g. hy de Varenne, loc. cit, p. 343 
et seq., who has twenty-two recipes for 'aumelettes.' Beaten 
eggs fried in fat. 

Orgeat, or orgeade : originalh- a thick, i.e., turbid, drink, made 
with barley, used by the ancients and adopted by the French ; 
this decoction of barley also bore the Greek name oi ptisana, or 
French tisane. While the latter name gradually became ex- 
tended in its application to many kinds of decoeiions and ififii- 
siojis of vegetable substances, having no longer any barley in 
their composition, the names orgeat\\\(i orgeade slipped awa}- 
from barley, and became attached, the first to syrup of almonds^ 
the second to milk of almonds, or were used promiscuoush- for 
both. The s}rup of almonds, when stirred in water, immediate!}- 
forms milk of almonds. 

Orly, also horly : a name given to dishes prepared in a certain 
style. vSee Hors d'oeuvres, supra. 

P 

Pabrica : the fleshy fruit of the green or red mild capsicum, grown 
in the South of Europe, and used as spice for ragouts or salads, 
e.g. , Hungarian gulasch. 

Panade : bread soaked in water, milk, cream, or broth, and pressed. 
Such is the definition now obtaining in culinary works. An- 
ciently panade was a kind of soup, made of bread, soaked in water, 
and pressed, with the addition of butter, salt, milk, or water, and 
a liaison of eggs with cream. More commonly panade is eaten 
in the South as a salad, with oil and tomatoes, onions, garlic, etc. 
The Portuguese form is called sourde {cf D.D., 796), and the 
Spanish gaspacJio. Simpson {Joe. cit., p. 19) calls a puree of 
Q\\\Q^evi panade, and says that panade of beef, mutton, or veal is 
made in the same way. Mme. de Joncourt (in ' Wholesome 
Cookery,' § 431) calls 'panade' a puree of rumpsteak and fowl 
or pheasant; there is no allusion to bread in the recipe, and the 
dish is no panade at all, but a mere puree, and must be termed 
so. Epanada is South Spanish and Portuguese for panada. 
Some German cooks call panade a paste made of flour, butter, 
and water, stirred with eggs, to be mixed with forcemeat for 
making quenelles or any other farce (propanade). 

Paner : French, to breadcrumb, over egg-yolk, sauce, butter, or 
fat previous to frying. 

Panure : French = cutlets, scollops, croquettes, or an}- other entree 
which is breadcrumbed. 

Pastry, 'Brench. patisserie, and all the tribe of words derived from 
it, comes, perhaps, from pasco, or pascor, I feed, e.g., on a 
meadow. Pastus is the feeding, pastio the feeding-ground ; and 
to such a pasty, or raised pie, with its various and voluminous 
contents, is strictly comparable. (Jeaff"reson, loc. cit., vol. ii., 
p. 45, derives it, in our opinion erroneously, from Latin pistum, 
past participle of pinso, pitisere, to beat together in a mortar, to 
pound.) In the prosecution of the connection of the tribe of v/ords 



DICTIONARY OF CULINARY TERMS 68i 



there are many difficulties, or inversely, suggestions encountered. 
E.g., paste froni dough is onl}' found as late Latin, \s\\\\^ pastillus, 
a little ball of flour-paste (or any similar ball of paste) is said to 
be a diminutive of /'a;//^, bread (Festus; cf. also Plin., 22, 12, 
14). This is the more likely, as, according to Varro, pas- 
tilliis, or pastil liun, signifies a small loaf of bread, or roll, 
as we term it. Probably paste as dough was derived later from 
pastus, the food of man' (Lucretius). Old French. = paste ; New 
French, pate; Late Latin, pesta. But as regards our pasties, pates 
and patties, all these supposed derivatives are invalid, appa- 
rentlv, before the Greek /; ttckjt)], a mixed dish of meat, a ragout, 
as the French term it, the old artocreas, to which pastaetnm, 
pasty, was considered a barbarous substitution ; oprog (i>) being- 
bread, artocreas means bread-meat, and is therefore a symbol 
of all pies and pasties, from sausage-rolls to giant pie up- 
wards. But the co-ordination of rracFTi] with apruKpeag renews the 
problem, to which the derivations from pa sso, to sprinkle, are no 
satisfaction at all. For artocreas see Persius, 6, 50. "Aprog is 
ivheaten bread, for barley bread is /<«?«, Hebrew mazze ; izaaTn is 
defined as a dish of mixed and cut-up food, meat being neither 
expressly mentioned nor excluded. But the word is the feminine 
form of the adjective ttcwtoq t) 6v, bestrewed, strewed over, particu- 
larly with salt, pickled, and its use as a substantive therefore 
involves an ellipse, and its identity with artocreas must be the 
result of evolution. Kraus, in his ' Medical Dictionary,' gives 
the Greek paste as signifying ' a firm cake made of a dough or 
paste,' with many possible derivations. But this translation is 
not supported b}- the great dictionaries. 

Paupiettes : French, from Italian polpettes, slices of meat covered 
with slices of bacon, over which a layer of farce has been spread ; 
they are rolled, wrapped in paper, and roasted on the spit ; when 
they are done, they are taken out of the paper, crumbed, and 
slightly browned, and served with sauce piquante (D.D., 809). See 
Canelons. 

Petty toes : the feet of sucking pigs. 

Pie: English, a quantity of meat or fruit baked in a dish while it 
is covered with a layer of paste, which is baked along with it. 
The etymology of the word is uncertain, some deriving it from 
the Irish and Gaelic name, pighe, for the same dish, which brings 
us no nearer. Pie being peculiarly national to England, we 
conclude that^^zV is probably the older, and/>/^/z<?the derived form. 

Piping: a kind of decoration made of icing, used for ornamenting 
cakes, pastry, small pastry, and stands ; it is produced with the 
aid of a short funnel or conically - shaped instrument of tin 
(inserted within a large-sized and similarh'-shaped paper funnel 
or cornet, the pointed end of which is cut off, so as to allow the 
tin instrument to protrude ; the icing, or glacing (a mixture of 
finely-pounded sugar and white of egg worked into a smooth 
paste), is placed in the cornet or forcer, the upper part of which 
is completely closed ; the glacing is then forced out at the point 
by pressure of the thumb on the upper part of the cornet. 

Placenta : the Latin name for cake in general, not for any particular 
cake ; derived from the Greek placous, which also means cake, 



682 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

and is itself a contraction of placoeis, meaning flat, plane, even, 
broad, so that the Greek name of cake seems to embod}" the idea 
of its accidental shape, and not to be a symbol of its intrinsic 
nature. 

Placouse : a dariole with apricot jam and nuts, such as almonds, 
pistachios, or filberts (The name does not occur in either 
lya Chapelle, ' Dons de Conius,' or Carenie.) Apricots and nuts 
being above the custard, a placouse is a transition from dariole 
to fanchonette. The culinary levellers of small modern manuals 
have absurdl}- called the placouse 'apricot nougat,' thus proving 
that the}' know neither the nature of a placouse nor the character 
of nougat. 

Pluche, French, or plush English, a mixture of leaves of parsley, 
chervil, tarragon, lettuce, or sorrel, chopped or cut small ; the 
herbs are used mixed or separatel}', as may be prescribed. 

Polony : a dry sausage, made of meat partly cooked. A corruption 
of Bologna sausage (' Heyse's Etymological Dictionary'). 

Pommes d'Api : small rosy apples named after the Roman Appius 
('vSmith and Hamilton's Dictionary'), but the nature of the con- 
nection of the name with the fruit is not explained. Perhaps the 
French name has some relation to the German Apfel and the 
English apple. 

Porringer: a small dish for porridge. 

Posset: hot milk, curdled with wine or acid ; from the Welsh ;!><7^^/, 
curdled milk; Irish pu so id, hatin possel/n/i ; zythogala [q.v.). 

Potage: French for soup. The French national comic person is 
called 'Jean Potage,' as the German equivalent goes b}- the name 
of 'Hans Wurst,' and the English used to be called by the now 
obsolete name of 'Jack Pudding.' 

Pottinger, or potter: learned pottinger, potter carrier; ancient 
popular name of apothecary or spice merchant. 

Poupeton : French, a preparation consisting of rice boiled in broth, 
and set up as a border, filled with fricassee of fowl or fish ; or a 
ragout of meat, covered with rice, breadcrumb, Parma cheese, 
butter, and baked to colour in an oven. D.D., 903, defines it as 
a cake made with hashed meat or fish. Roast pigeons or fowls 
are immersed in the hachis. 

Poupetonniere : PVench, a vessel to make a poupeton in. 

Praline : burnt almond ; hencQ praliner, to roast, burn crisp. 

Presale, or pre-sale : specially good mutton, from a place of that 
name (' M. des Aniphit.,' p. 43 ; Goufte, 534). 

Profitrolles: a light kind of pastry, creamed inside. 

Puchero: Spanish national dish, ragout of meat and vegetables, the 
simple form oi olla [q.v.). 

Pudding, English, is of uncertain derivation ; in French it was 
formerly called poutin (La Chapelle), or poutinade ('Dons de 
Comus,' i. 298), but the spelling does not occur in modern dic- 
tionaries. The modern French culinary word boudln is not prac- 
ticall}' equivalent to pudding, as its application is confined to 
compositions of meat, or other animal products, such as the 
English black pudding. 

Puree : French, a pulpy maceration or paste of roast meat, vege- 
tables, fruit, etc., passed through a tammy or sieve.

O 

Quasi de veau : French, the thick end, jump end, of a loin of veal. 

QueneiFes : French, synonym of quenelles, used by Careme, 

Quenelle : a delicate sort of forcemeat, ball or dumpling, used in 
the preparation of entrees, and put in soups. Called kneffs in 
'Dons de Comus,' ii. 127, and in some German culinary works 
also Skcneffes. Translated as Kiwdel b}- Rottenhofer {loc. cit., 
p. 73) erroneously. The name is probably derived from the Greek 
knesuia, knisuia, triturated or scraped, grated matter. 

Quodling: a cooking apple. See Codlin. 

R 

Ragout: a rich compound, consisting of quenelles, mushrooms, 
truffles, fat livers, mixed with a rich sauce, and used for garnish- 
ing highly-finished removes and entrees. It is therefore not 
really a dish b}- itself, but a complement or garnish of other 
preparations ; but these, when so garnished, are also termed 
ragouts. 

Rascane : French, a fish (not in dictionary). 

Ratafia, also spelled rataffia and tafia, is believed to be derived 
from the Malay tafia, a spirit or liqueur from cane-sugar S5'rup, 
therefore the East Indian original of the West Indian rum. The 
prefix ra is a contraction of the Arabian arrack, the spirit dis- 
tilled from malted and fermented rice, and sweetened, araq 
meaning both juice and swxet — i.e., as we term it, a liqueur. 

Ravioli (Italian), ravioles, raviolles, rabioles (French), was originally 
the name of ' des raves tendres bien epluchees et blanchies ' 
('Donsde Comus,' ii. 395) ; at present signifies an Italian national 
dish, consisting of little shells or capsules of thin nouilles dough, 
in which a savoury meat farce is enclosed. They are boiled^ in 
broth, and served either in the soup as quenelles, or separatel)' 
with brown gravy as entree. The name is derived from the shape 
given to the little capsules, which are formed b}- turning up the 
four corners of the dough enclosing the farce, and twisting 
them into a tapering stem like the thin part of the little rave. 
Rabiolles described as Italian dish in ' Dons de Comus,' iii. 146. 

Refectioner ; Old English, a restaurateur. 

Releves, or removes : the top and bottom dishes, as they are 
designated in F^ngland, following the soup and fish on ordinar}- 
tables. They usualh- consist of roasts, joints, tiirkeys, capons, 
highly or plainly dressed fillets, or rolls, etc., of beef, calf s head, 
etc. Some innovators have releves for every course, a useless 
and confusing extension. 

Rissoler : to brown by frying or baking in an oven ; metaphoric use 
of the eftect of sunlight upon human skin ; e.g., rissole (visage) 
par le soleil (sunburnt). 

Rissoles : mincemeat fritters. 

Ris de veau (not riz) : the sweetbread, pancreas ; name not ex- 
plained. A supposed tropic from ris, laughter, is not easil}- 
derived. 

Rob : English and French, from Arab. Robub (contracted roob), 
inspissated fruit juice of the consistence of honey ; that of grapes. 



684 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

which is much used, is termed sapa. Robs were much used in 
cookery; they are now called extracts, and a little more con- 
centrated than were the robs. 

Roti : French, meat cooked on the spit before the fire, roasted, or 
in the oven, baked. The roasts at festive dinners are the principal 
part of the so-called second service. The French call gros roti 
the large joints of roast meat, such as beef, veal, leg of mutton ; 
le petit roti is a fowl ; game and small quadrupeds are petits 
pieds. 

Roux, French, is the result of the fr3'ing of flour in butter or grease 
(lard, dripping). While frying, the mixture is constantly stirred 
to prevent the flour from forming lumps ; from roux, feminine 
rousse, red, sandy {i.e. in colour). Roux brun is fried to a 
darker colour (a caramel of starch) ; roux blanc (actually a con- 
tradiction in terms, but used) is hardly coloured or uncoloured ; 
probably the starch is only a little caramelized, but mainly 
transformed into dextrine. Sauce rousse is brown sauce ; beurre 
roux is broivned butter without flour, also called beurre noir. Un 
7W/;r (substantive) is given as ' brown butter sauce ' in 'Smith and 
Hamilton's Dictionary ' ; but this is erroneous, as the roux is not 
complete by itself, but is an addition to sauces, soups, and 
ragouts. Some German cooks call the white roux IVeissDiehl, 
the brown roux Braujimehl, and the process of producing them 
das Einbrennen. 



Sabayon : Italian name for wine (madeira or malvoisie) mulled with 
3olks, sugar, and cinnamon (D.D., 471). 

Saindoux : French, hog's lard for fr3'ing. 

Sally Lunn : English, a tea-cake, after its inventor. Careme has 
Solilenne a VAnglaise {loc. cit., ii. 32), and terms it ' grosse piece de 
fond.'' 

Salmagundy : a kind of salad of cold chicken, veal, eggs, beetroot, 
parsley, anchovies, red pickled cabbage, ham, all finely minced, 
grated tongue, seasoning, herbs, and spices. The ingredients are 
laid in rows, so as to produce designs, strata, and colour effects ; 
almost identical with Polish salad. Derivation of name not 
known ; may be connected with salmis in part. 

Salmis : a highh^ finished hash or ragout made with roast game or 
wild-fowl in a rich gravy or sauce. 

Salpicon, synonym salipicon : a savoury mixture of equal parts of 
meat and vegetables — such as truffles, mushrooms, tongue, sweet- 
bread, poultr}', or game — that has undergone the process of 
cooking in a separate state, and of mincing preparator}- to being 
mixed with bechamel, allemande, or espagnole sauce. It may 
be used for filling boudins or patties. 

Salsifis. See Scorzonera. 

Sarrasin : Saracen, buckwheat brought to France by the Moors. 

Sauce : What we now term sauce the ancient Romans called jus, 
plural y^^rrt ; the word became limited to the designation oiuieat- 
juice or gravy. A liquid in which meat was preserved or matured 
for cooking (now called a marinade) was at the time of Pliny 
termed salsugo, or salsilago. Jura and salsugos became mixed in 



DICTIONARY OF CULINARY TERMS 685 



use, and such a mixture was termed a salsuui or a salsa ; in 
Italian salza, which the French transformed into saulza, and 
ultimately into sauce. Though sauciers were a metier at Paris 
early in the sixteenth centur}-, like moutardicrs and vinaigriers, 
sauces were not generally known under that name even during 
the seventeenth century ;' the word does not occur in Varenne's 
work of 1699, nor does a single recipe, so that the development 
of French sauces, as we know them now, is posterior to that date, 
and belongs to the eighteenth centiiry. 

Saur (hareng), sauret : smoked herring, not necessarily salted; 
French, from saicrer, to smoke. 

Saute : French, the condition of any edible thing, cutlets of game, 
poultry, or fish, or kebobs of meat, etc., or potatoes, lightly or 
quickly fried in butter. Its strict English equivalent is tossed, 
which, like tosser or sautapan, was much used a century ago. 
The true action oi satiter, or faire saiUer, or oi tossing, consists in 
quickly shaking the pan to and fro on a horizontal plane, 
whereby the contents change places and become mixed without 
being injured b}- a stirrer. 

Scorpene: French, a fish. (Not in dictionary.) 

Scorzonera: Latin, salsifis French, s3-nonyni salsifix or screson- 
naive ('Dons de Conius,' ii. 444); from Spanish sciirzo7i, a snake. 
The roots, black in one, white in another variety, are excellent 
entremets when stewed. The young etiolated leaves, growing in 
the cellar, are eaten as salad. 

Seakale ; English, choiix de mer French ; occurs as sikeles in 
French books. 

Shrub : English, orange-juice, zest, and rum punch. 

Sillabub, also spelled syllabub; of varieties, a Somersetshire, a 
Staffordshire, and a solid sillabub are mentioned : a liquor made 
of wine or cider, mixed with milk (or colostrum, the first milk 
which a cow gives after calving, which is very fat), and sweetened. 
(The etymologist of ' Chambers' Etymological Dictionary ' 
adds an' amusing conjecture: 'Perhaps from slabbering it up 
quickly.') 

Skilly : the gruel or porridge given as nutriment to able-bodied 
paupers in London workhouses. The word is perhaps derived 
from the name of a vessel used in cooking, called skillet (perhaps 
from Old French escuellette, diminutive of escuelle, French ecuelle, 
from Latin scutella, diminutive of scutra, a dish or plate, or cup 
to drink out of) ; the word from which scullery (disher}') also is 
derived. Hence scullion is a dishwasher. 

Sommelier, or grand sommelier : the chief butler of a great or royal 
house ; hence the butter}- or pantry was called somniellcrie 
[cf. Kitchiner, loc. cit., p. 42, note. 

Sorrel : French, alezan saure (perhaps related to the German saner, 
English sour), oseille, oxalide oseille. 

Souffle: a pufifed-up light kind of pudding, served as a remove to 
second course roasts, made with any kind of farinaceous sub- 
stance, which is first cooked by itself, and then mixed with an 
^^^ liaison, made to rise by baking in an oven. 

Soup is a development froni gruel by the addition of vegetables, 
fat, and meat; now essentially a savoury meat-broth with vege-

tables or their extract. Soup is defined in ' Chambers' Etymo- 
logical Dictionary' as 'the juice obtained by boiling (it is not 
said what substance nor in what material), seasoned, and often 
mixed with vegetables. From German Suppe.' 

Soy: Japanese, called also Indian and Chinese, condensed, as it is 
said, fermented extract of the soy bean ; an agreeable, somewhat 
aromatic, warm, salted, brown, sauce-like fluid, which serves as 
an agreeable flavouring to dishes— ^.^., fish. English ^6>;' (' Eaton's 
Dictionar}-') is ivalnut ketchup {q.v.). 

Spitchcock, to : to grill ; spitchcocked eel -= anguille grille, spitch- 
cocked chicken —poult grille. 

Squab: English, a 3-oung pigeon, name used particularly in North 
America; squab-chicken, a }oung chicken ; applicable to animals 
while young, fat, and clumsy. Squab-pie is therefore primarily 
a (young) pigeon-pie. Such a pie becomes Devofishire squab-pie 
by the addition of apples. Squabs =/'/^^o;/^ imwcents of French 
cooks. 

Stake signifies not only the wooden pole or tree so often emplo3ed 
in the ecclesiastical mode of loving 3'our neighbour, but also the 
small meal, breakfast, luncheon, lunch, and tiffin. Although the 
pronunciation of both words is equal, j-et they are perhaps not 
connected with each other. The w^ord stake for small meal is 
not often used, but may be derived from steak, which, in fact, 
more often serves the purpose of lunch than of dinner. 

Steak means the slice of meat which is to be grilled, roasted, or 
fried ; its Danish eqiiivalent is steeg, its German St'ilck = piece. 

Stove, to : to heat or bake in a stove or oven. 

Sweet-pot is not an eatable, but a collection of perfumed and 
savoury flowers, herbs and spices, stratified with salt in a pot. 
It is therefore a siveet-scented pot. 



Talmouse : a dariole, the custard contained in which has received 
an addition of cheese of au}^ kind, fresh or ripe. 

Tansy; English, tanaisie French, the yellow flowering composite 
wild plant Tanacetum vulgare ; its expressed juice was used for 
flavouring, and (with spinach extract) colouring certain dishes. 
A tansy was a kind of custard of cream and eggs so coloured, 
poured over Naples biscuits or breadcrumb, with wine, sugar 
and nutmeg, and either baked in paste in a pie-dish, or boiled in 
a basin covered with a buttered cloth, therefore a pudding 
('Eaton's Dictionar}' '). 

Tart : from the Latin torta, a baked ring of twisted dough, which 
was laid round, and eaten with, cooked fruit. The name now 
includes a great number of cakes of a complicated kind. 

Tartlets : French tartelettes, small tarts, mostly Mdth preserved 
fruit or jam. 

Tendrons: French, the cartilages of ribs near the sternum of the 
young calf (erroneously termed tendons in some ciilinary works 
of this century — Beauvilliers, Gouffe, Francatelli). 

Timbale: a druin-like pudding-shell, made of macaroni or rice, 
filled with forcemeat or ragout. 



DICTIONARY OF CULINARY TERMS 687 

Topinambur : original Brazilian name of Helianthus tubcrosus. Was, 
like Its namesake, called ^7/'c7^<?/, and, from the taste of its tuber, 
artichoke. This was barbarized into Jerusalem artichoke. All 
classical cooks term it 'topinambur' [e.g. ' Dons de Conius,' vol. 
ii., p. 444). 

Tosser: English, sautapan, often used in 'Eaton's Dictionar}-.' 

Tourts : French, from Latin torta ; signifies in modern French a 
flake dough case, in Mhich different ragouts are served for entrees. 
According to a reported observation of Taillevant, the master- 
cook of the French King Charles V., tourte signified at one time 
a household loaf of bread in a round form, and the name was 
only later given to pastr}' with meat}- contents. It is not impos- 
sible that' the French tourte might be derived from tourette, 
English turret, a little tower, to the shape of which the French 
loaf of Taillevant would correspond. The modern French 
diminutive of tour is, however, tourelle. 

Trifle : a sweet dish composed of sponge-cake, soaked in wine or 
liqueurs, macroons, fruit jams, custard, and whipped cream ; a 
second course dish. 

Tripe : the prepared and boiled stomach and alimentary canal of 
oxen and other animals. 

Truffer : French, to communicate to an}' dish the flavour of trufiies; 
also applied to maraschino so flavoured. 

Truffles : peculiar pale and dark round fungi, growing underground 
in the South of France and in Africa, great idols of French 
cooks and gastronomers. 

Turbans : ornamental drum-shaped cases, containing entrees, made 
of forcemeat, and fillets of either game, poultry, or fish, similar to 
mazarines. 

Tum-broche, or turnspit : Formerly joints while being roasted were 
turned by young persons or trained dogs ; now they are turned 
by clockwork previously wound up. 



Uxelles. vSee D'Uxelles. 

V 

Viands, vivers : ancient expressions for victuals. 

Vol-au-vent : a metaphoric expression applied to a case of puff paste 

of the lightest kind, baked in an empty state (blind pasty), to be 

filled with a light ragout or fricassee. 

W 

Wafer : a thin leaf of cooked starch paste for sealing letters ; the 
thin round cake of the Eucharist; in Old French zuaufre, hence 
gaufre a.\\A muffrc, German IVaffel, English 7ua_ffle ; derived from 
German JVabe, honeycomb. Hence a waffle-iron, for baking 
waffles in, is called honeycomb cockle, a name which it bears in 
common with the iron-cake-shell (-fish). This fact supports the 
derivation from JVabe, as much as the shape of the waffle. 

Walnut ketchup : the concentrated and spiced expressed juice of 
half-grown yet tender walnuts, such as are used for pickling ; 



688 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 

boiled with shallots and anchovies, mace, cloves, pepper, and 
garlic. Kept in well-stoppered bottles. vSonie add vinegar. 
Excellent addition to sauces, such as fish sauce. 

Wastle cake : Scotch ; wastle bread was baked on a girdle, therefore 
analogous to the English girdle, or griddle, cake. 

Water-fish occurs in various barbarizations, which are handed down 
through all the books published during two centuries. The 
word was intended to mean siveet-iuater fish, and came from Ger- 
many through Holland to France. The latest English author has 
Vaslrefichc, in recipes taken from * Dons de Comus,' ii., 68, 113, 151. 
The climax was reached by a la Vaslrefiche, when a thing became 
a method. The recipes have no vitality, and will soon be ob- 
solete. Carenie has luaier-wish, and a choice between water-fiche 
and vater fiche ('Maitre d'Hot,' i., pp. 34, 74, 120). 

White pot : English, ancient preparation of cream (a pint) with 
3-olks (four, beaten), pulp of apples, sugar, spices, and sipjjets of 
' white ' bread, to be baked in a dish or in a crust. This is a 
kind of custard fruit puree pie, verging towards a charlotte. A 
simpler recipe has milk instead of cream, but a greater number 
of 3-olks. 

Z 

Zythogala: grsecified name applied by Sydenham, the English 
physician, and later by the French doctor Pecquet, to the then 
popular posset ; it was curds and whe\^ produced b}- the addition 
to milk either of an acid wine, such as cyder, or of vinegar 
merel}-. Begin, in the 'Diet. Med.,' gave the name of zythogala 
to a mixture of beer and milk ; but this does not generally curdle, 
except the beer be acetified. This use of beer has given rise to 
the misapprehension that posset could also be made with the 
aid oi pears, perhaps perry in place of cyder; but it is more 
probabl}' a misprint or clerical error arising from misreading 
Birnen (pears) instead of Bier (beer). 

Zythos: an alcoholic liquid prepared by fermentation, beer, fruii- 
zviue, cyder (as apple- wine) ; the name also extends to vinegar, 
)repared from beer or fruit-wine (Kraus, 'Med. Lex.'). Cham- 
)ers' 'Etymological Dictionary' spells cider {q.v.).
