PREFACE 



TO to be a Good Cook means the knowledge of all 
Fruits, Herbs, Balms and Spices, and all that is 
healing and sweet in fields and groves, and savory 
in meats, means carefulness, inventiveness, watchfulness, 
willingness and readiness of appliance. It meams the economy 
of your great grand mothers and the science of modern 
chemists. It means much tasting and no wasting. It means 
English thoroughness, French art and Arabian hospitality. It 
means in fine, that you are to be perfectly and always ladies 
(loaf-givers) and are to ^e^ that everyone has something nice to eat.

ribs cut up and put aside for stewing or braising, but leave 
the other bones in the roast except at the end which joins the 
back bone. Sear the cut bides of the roast in some very hot 
drippings to keep in the juices, then lay the roast on a meat

and pepper and place a piece of suet on top. Have the oven

bottom, adding when needed boiling water. Baste fre- 
quently. Mrs. Haughey.

DANGEROUS GASES IN MEAT PIES. 

If a meat pie is cut and eaten hot there is no danger of 
its Jbeing poisonous, but if set away to cool, be sure that there 
is an opening through the crust down to the meat. Sometimes 
the rising of the crust, while baking, causes the opening to 
-close, and this should be guarded against. 

MEAT PIE. 

Cut a round steak in small pieces and boil until tender. 
When almost, done, slice one onion and 6 potatoes, and boil 
with the meat, season with salt and pepper and sage, adding a 
lump of butter if not rich enough. When the potatoes are 
done, thicken with some flour made smooth in water. Line 
.a baking dish with crust, put in the meat and potatoes, cover 
with a crust and bake to a nice brq\vn. The onion may be 
omitted. Mrs. J. Falk. 

MINCED LIVER.

TRIPE. 

Tripe from the butcher's shop is ready to use, but one

rinse in cold water, and lay in salt water a day, changing 
often. The next day, cut in strips, whiten by laying in 
buttermilk for a few hours. Boil in salted water until 
tender.

SPANISH CHICKEN PIE. 

Cut up and stew i chicken until tender. Prepare from 
dried Chili peppers 1-2 tea cup of pulp, which is done by first 
removing the seeds and grains (the hot part) and boiling 
until soft, then scrape out the insfde with a knife. Add this

more than necessary, turn on a well floured board, press out 
an inch thick, cut into biscuits, dip each one into melted 
butter and lay over the chicken closely, except, in one space 
in the middle. The chicken should be boiling hot, or the

SWEET BREADS. 

The sweet bread is the Thymus gland found in the neck 
of the veal. It should be soaked i or 2 hours in cold 
water, parboiled 20 minutes, then plunged into cold water to 
harden. Take out and drain and remove the pipes and 
membrane. They may then be cut into thin slices, fried, 
stewed or served with any meat sauce one likes. Use i can 
mushrooms and one pair of sweet breads diced, dredge with a 
little flour and brown quickly in hot butter, seasoning with 
.salt and pepper. Sweet breads are also very good served 
with Spanish meat sauce. 

MOCK SWEET BREADS. 

Housekeepers who like to try new dishes may be glad of 
the following recipe. Chop 2 Ibs. of veal and 1-4 lb. of veal 
.suet very fine, soak a good sized roll or piece of bread in water 
and beat up lightly. Then mix this with the veal, add suet, 
the grated rind of i lemon, salt and pepper to taste, very little 
nutmeg, and 2 eggs, shape like sweet breads, dip in beaten 
eggs and bread crumbs and fry to a golden brown. 

Mrs. E. D. Hatch. 

TO BONE AND BOIL A HAM. 

First take out the small bone that runs across the large 
end of the ham. Laying the ham skin side down on the table, 
split it lengthwise on the meat side following the bone, and 
trim the bone out carefully. One should have a very thin, 
sharp knife. Make notches in the rind to hold the cord, and 
tie it up very lightly so that the slices will look well. Be sure 
that the cord is stout enough to hold it. Put it on to cook in 
plenty of cold water, and boil slowly. It usually takes 31-2 
or 4 hours for a 12 lb. ham. Peel the rind off when cold. 
Wiith a little practice one can bone a ham easily and with no 
waste,- and the slices have a much better appearance. 

Mrs. A. Bacon. 

PICKLED PIGS' FEET. 

Scald and scrape the feet until perfectly clean and cook

TAMALES. 

An old fat hen makes the best tamales. Cut it up and stew 
in plenty of water until tender. Put about 90 dried corn husks 
to soak in tepid water to make them pliable ; prepare a cup of 
red pepper pulp or use 3 heaping tablespoons Chili powder, 
and add it to the stew' when the chicken is done. Also salt 
an onion that has been browned in butter, garlic may be 
used if liked. Pour off half the liquor, leaving the chicken 
in one kettle with just enough liquid to cover it, thicken the 
stew with flour made smooth in water. 

Make a thick dough in the other kettle by stirring into 
the boiling liquor the best white corn meal sifted with about 
2 tablespoons flour to prevent lumping and add more salt. 
Mexicans grind corn fresh every time, but for American 
taste the corn meal answers very well. 

To fill the tamales lay upon a table overlapping from you 
7 or 9 corn husks, according to size, and on the one nearest 
you put. some chicken stew, 3 olives, and 5 raisins. On the 
remaining husks put a thin layer of the dough, rolling it out

with a twine. 

Pack closely in a steamer, cover tightly and set over boiling 
water in which has been placed several whole cloves. Cook 
4 hours or until time to serve. Veal makes good tamales, and

PEPPER 39 

PEPPER. 

Of this aromatic berry or fruit there are several kinds. 
The black comes from berries which grow on vines some- 
thing- like grapes. Each berry contains a seed which is black 
when dried and is the pepper of commerce. Black pepper 
is much more irritating than white, and even small quan- 
tities produce detrimental effects on the digestive organs. 
White pepper is made by steeping the black berries in lime 
water and rubbing off their hard outer coats. Cayenne 
pepper is made from the dried pods of various species of 
capsicum. It is stimulating, and though not used as com- 
monly as black or white pepper, is much more wholesome. 
Chillis is the Mexican name meaning pods.

VEGETABLES 



"If fresh meat be wanting to fill up our dish, 
We have carrots and pumpkins and turnips and fish." 
"In speaking of vegetables, I must add a few words in favor 
of the further adoption in this country of the French practice 
of using for soups the water in which vegetables generally (ex- 
cepting potatoes) have been boiled. When we boil cabbage, 
turnips, carrots, celery, etc., we dissolve out of them a large 
proportion of their salts without which we become victims to 
various ills." 

Put vegetables into plenty of boiling water, do not let it 
stop boiling, and take them out as soon as done. 

Potatoes become unfit for food if exposed to the light or 
air. Keep them well covered and in a dark place. A potato 
exposed to the sun or wind will turn green. Probably the best 
method of cooking potatoes is steaming them in the skins. If 
peeled and then boiled, a large amount of salts are lost. Old 
potatoes that are shriveled or sprouted are improved by being 
peeled and kept over night in plenty of cold water. 

Old potatoes that are too small to peel can be steamed un- 
til done. Peel arid pour over them enough cream to coat 
each potato well, put in the baking dish, sprinkle with grated 
cheese, salt and cayenne pepper, brown in the oven and serve 
very hot. Mrs. Haughey. 

POTATO PUFF. 

-Boil and mash potatoes in the usual way, beat up very light 
with milk or cream, salt to taste, put into a baking dish, smooth 
over the top, brush with the yolk of egg, dot with butter, and 
dust very lightly with flour. Brown in a hot oven.

"Celery grows wild nearly all over Europe, chiefly in 
dittches and marshes along the sea, and in its wild state is 
-called smallage. It was first cultivated by Italian gardeners 
and the result of their labors was two plants, called celery 
and celeriac. Celeriac is sometimes called a turnip-rooted 
celery and is extensively used by the Germans. Use the root 
as any root vegetable boiling it and seasoning it in the same 
way. It is also very nice in soup, and a very useful vegetable, 
as easily grown as a turnip, but having a decided celery 
flavor."

"What first I want is daily bread." John Quincy Adams. 

It has been said that somewhere near 724 B. C. a slave at 
Athens left some wheatened dough in an earthened jar, and 
forgot it. Some clays afterward, when the dough had become 
sour, he was about to throw it away, when his master ap- 
peared, whereupon, in order to cover up his fault, he mixed it 
with the fresh dough that he was preparing. The bread pro- 
duced by this dough, in which fermentation had begun was 
liked by the master and his friends and when the slave was 
summoned he told his secret. Thus leavened bread was dis- 
covered by accident. 

YEAST WITHOUT A START. 

Boil 2 oz. hops in i gallon of water 1-2 hour, strain, let

Ib. sugar. Beat i Ib. of flour with some of the liquid, mix 
all well together, allow it stand for 3 or 4 days, then add 3 
Ib. mashed potatoes, let it stand i day longer, stirring often. 
This should be made in a 2 gallon stone crock, set in a warm 
place, and kept at the temperature of new milk. When done, 
strain into glass jars and keep in a cool place. This yeast 
will keep a long time. 

To set bread, take i cup of mashed potato, scald 2 table- 
spoons flour, i teaspoon each salt and sugar, and when cool, 
add 2 tablespoons of the yeast. Set sponge at noon for bread at 
night. Mrs. H. W. McClellan.

In buying flour, the best is always the cheapest. The 
amount of water which flour would absorb is a better test 
than its color, because flour containing an abundance of 
gluten will absorb more water than that which contains a 
larger amount of starch. Such flour will make more bread 
and is therefore cheaper to buy. Pastry flour is the finest 
white flour, and comes from the center of the kernel. It is 
also called "Old Process" or "St. Louis" flour. It is very 
highly sifted. 

BREAD WITH COMPRESSED YEAST. 

For 4 loaves cook 2 potatoes in i pint water, when done 
mash, and when luke warm add one cake compressed yeast 
that has been dissolved in a little water. Stir in sifted flour 
until the mixture is a little thicker than griddle cake batter 
and set in a warm place until it rises. 

Then add to the sponge i qt. of luke warm water, i table- 
spoon each salt, sugar and butter and enough flour as can 
make as soft a dough as can be handled well. Knead until 
perfectly smooth and elastic, usually about 25 minutes and set 
to rise again in a warm place. When the bulk is doubled, 
shape into loaves, prick each one through with a fork, place in 
well greased pans and when light bake.

each loaf of bread take i cup of yeast and i cup of water with 
i teaspoon lard and salt, knead stiff and let it rise at least 6 
hours ; don't force ; make into loaves and bake. Best made in 
the morning, as it raises too much overnight. The quicker it 
is raised, the lighter and whiter the loaves.

BREAD SET WITH DRY YEAST CAKE. 

At supper time dissolve i cake of yeast foam in 1-2 cup 
of hike warm water. Boil and mash fine 3 medium sizid 
potatoes, pour over them the water in which they were boiled 
and add while still hot flour enough to make a moderately stiff 
batter. When cool add the dissolved yeast cake. Let it rise 
over night in a warm place. In the morning add 3 pints of 
warm water, 2 teaspoons of salt and as much sifted flour as 
you can beat in with a spoon. Let it rise in a warm place. 
When light add 11-2 teaspoons of lard and the same amount 
of sugar. Knead stiff, adding as much flour as required. 
Let it rise again, then make into loaves and bake in a moderate 
oven 45 minutes. Mrs. Esther Jacobson. 

"One simple little song we sing 

To brides but newly wed, 
Jnst make the best of everything 

Especially of bread." 

Inexperienced housekeepers will find it a good rule to at- 
tempt at the beginning only a few things. One might well 
begin with bread, which has been called the "Staff of Life," 
and is indispensable to good living. Never be discouraged by 
a few failures, for " Tis held that sorrow makes us wise." 

Many housekeepers make the mistake of setting their 
bread overnight. One secret of good bread is that every 
stage of the whole process shall be rapid. At the precise mo- 
ment when the sponge is fully light, the bread should be 
kneaded, and the process should require not longer than 31-2 
hours. Great care should be taken to keep the bread warm, 
but not too hot, as great heat will cause the bread to sour. 
Old bread makers preferred a slow rise, which they believe 
made sweeter bread but later scientific developments point 
toward a quick rising as the best, because yeast being a plant 
which lives and dies, by quick fermentation the plant is living, 
when the bread is ready to bake, and by the slower process, 
only the dead spores were left. 

The yeast should be fresh and lively, or the bread will be 
heavy and indigestible. Unless your flour is near the range, 
sift a quantity of flour in a large pan, and set in front of the 
oven to warm for an hour or so. 



"Don't have more secrets than you can carry yourself ." 
76 BREADS 

The wetting should be blood heat, and the best way to 
mix bread is to stir the yeast into the water, first measuring 
the water to regulate the size of the baking. 

The kneading is very important because if the dough is 
not thoroughly mixed and the yeast evenly distributed the 
fermentation will not be uniform. The kneading is best done 
on a bread board, and when the dough is ready to rise it 
should be a smooth, elastic, even grained mass. 

Brick shaped pans are preferable to others. Allow room 
in the pans for the second rising, which will require about I 
hour. The oven should be well heated so that the loaves 
will begin to brown within 15 minutes, and the fire should be 
kept steady so that the center of the loaf will bake. In slack 
baked bread the veast germs are not all killed, and such 
bread is unwholesome. After the loaves are baked, butter 
the crust and cool as quickly as possible on a wire toaster, 
resting on 2 pans so that the air will pass around the loaves. 

Hop Yeast : Steep a handful of hops in 2 qts of boiling 
water, strain it, on to 4 peeled potatoes and boil till done. Mix 
together and stir into the boiling potato water 3 tablespoons 
sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, i level teasopon ginger. Strain 
the whole mixture through a potato press, cool to blood heat, 
add i cup yeast or i cake compressed yeast. Let rise over 
night and put away in a crock. This will keep 2 weeks in a 
cool place, but is best made every week. If the flour is not 
thoroughly scalded the yeast will be likely to sour. 

\\Tiole Wheat Bread : Sift, whole wheat flour into a large 
pan, and put by the stove to warm. Measure into another pan 
i qt. of warm water, stir into it one cup yeast, 1-4 cup mo- 
lasses, i handful salt, and whole wheat flour as long as you 
can stir the batter with a spoon. Then work in white flour 
until you can handle the dough, turn it out on a well floured 
kneading board, and knead or until it is very smooth and 
elastic and will leave the hands. It is always more sticky than

BAKING POWDER. 

Eight oz. cream of tartar, 4 oz. baking soda, 4 oz. corn 
starch. Sift well together several times, as the chief danger 
of failure lies in not having the ingredients well mixed. If 
yon are sure of the quality of cream of tartar, you will have 
an article that you know is pure. 

The action of baking powder consists in the fact that 
when wet it effervesces, and gives off carbonic acid gas, 
Avhich operates in the same way as the gas given off by 
yeast. The action of baking powder, however, is soon over, 
and if the bread or pastry is not baked at once, the gas begins 
to escape, and the dough will settle. To succeed when using 
baking powder, 2 things are necessary : the powder must be 
thoroughly and perfectly sifted with the flour, and after the 
powder has been wet so that it rises, it must be baked as soon 
as possible. 

BAKING POWDER BISCUIT. 

Sift together i qt. of flour, 2 heaped teaspons baking 
powder, and i teaspoon salt. Mix in with the hand i heaped 
tablespoon lard, and enough sweet milk to make soft dough. 
Knead just enough to roll out, handling as little as possible, 
cut into shape and bake in a hot oven. Owing to the action 
of baking powder, success depends on kneading quickly, mak- 
ing the dough soft, and baking in a quick oven.

PUDDINGS 

"If you could make a pudding wi' thinking o' the batter, 
it 'ud be easy getting dinner." George Eliot. 

A pudding should be mixed as one would mix the cake, 
butter and sugar and creamed first, then the eggs beaten 
light, and added, then the other ingredients, with the fruit 
floured and added last. Stir just enough after the fruit 
has been added to mix it with the batter. Puddings with 
much fruit should have more flour in order to hold up the 
weight of the fruit. 

Puddings, as a rule, are much lighter steamed than 
boiled. It is not necessary to have a mould ; melt the rims 
from fruit cans the desired size, grease them well, fill a 
little over half full of batter, stand them in a steamer over boil- 
ing water, lay a thick cloth over the top of the steamer, put 
on the cover,, and set a weight upon it. Do not remove the 
cover or jar the kettle. The cloth absorbs the moisture 
and if not used the steam condenses on the inside of the 
cover and makes the pudding soggy. Use the same cans 
and rule for steaming brown bread. In boarding houses 
and in families where a few are served at a time, 'the small 
cans will be found very convenient. Miss May Burton.

GOCM* FAMILY PIE CRUST. 

This rule makes 4 pies with 2 crusts. Have the filling for

immediately. Sift together i qt. flour, i teaspoon each baking 
powder and salt. Rub into it with the fingers i cup of lard. 
Then stir in with a spoon enough cold water to make a dough. 
Do not knead, leave the dough as soft as can be handled. To 
prevent the juice from running out of pies made from straw- 
berries, blackberries and other small juicy fruit, mix the sugar 
with cracker dust, it is much nicer than flour, and seal the 
edges of the pie with an inch wide strip of muslin wet in 
water, leaving one end loose so that it can be easily stripped 
off. Mrs. C. W. Whitten.

PICKLES AND PRESERVES 

"Here, is fruit for an epicure meet, 

Canned and pickled and smothered in sweet; 

The wealth of a summer's mellow prime, 
To cheer the .dearth of winter's rime." 

VINEGAR. 

Vinegar is a form of acetic acid, and its flavor varies 
according to the source from where it is obtained. It is fre- 
quently adulterated with other acids which are very injurious. 
All vegetable juices can go through the fermentation and 
produce vinegar. Fruit that has begun to work, jelly that will 
not set and any parings of fruit will make the best of vinegar. 

APPLE VINEGAR. 

When cooking apples, save the parings and cores, if sound ; 
put them into a large crock, adding enough salt water to keep 
them covered. When the crock is nearly full, add i cup brown 
sugar or molasses, and i cup of yeast to every 6 or 8 qts of 
water. Stir well, keep the crock where it is warm and cover 
it with a piece of cheesecloth to keep out insects. It will make 
good vinegar in about two weeks. Strain and put into glass 
vessels, for if kept in the glazed crock, the acid will attack the 
glazing and extract the lead. Mrs. Haughey.

CREAM CANDIES. 

Fondant is the foundation of all cream candies and a great 
variety of pretty bon bons can be made by noticing the shapes 
and forms of French candies and imitating them. Place 2 
cups granulated sugar, i cup cold water, and a pinch of cream 
of tartar in a kettle, boil rapidly without stirring until done, 
10 minutes usually being sufficient for this quantity. 
Stirring will surely cause it, to grain. 

Test it thus : Hold the fingers in cold water, then roll a 
drop of the syrup between them and if it forms a creamy ball, 
the syrup is done. Remove immediately from the fire, allow 
it to become luke warm, now stir with a wooden paddle until 
it looks creamy and begins to harden on top. Then knead 
with the hands until it is smooth and creamy. 

Chocolate Creams : Roll a piece of' fondant between the 
hands into a cylindrical shape, cut it into pieces an inch long, 
roll each between the palms and give it a round shape and lay 
on paraffine paper to harden. 

Coating for the Creams : Melt a cake of Baker's choco- 
late over the teakettle. When it is liquid, put into it a piece 
of paraffine the size of a walunt, half as much butter, and a 
few drops of vanilla stirring so as to mix it thoroughly. Dip 
the creams and lay on paraffine paper to harden. 

Creamed Figs: Cut figs in half, dip in -melted fondant 
and lay on wax paper to harden.

Always bny the whole roasted berry and grind it as 
needed. The coffee should be of good quality and the water 
freshly boiled, and the pot so clean that there is not an odor 
of coffee about it. If the pot has become coated, clean it by 
boiling it out with water and a piece of sal soda the size 
-of a hickory nut. 

Mix thoroughly i cup of freshly ground coffee with 1-2
