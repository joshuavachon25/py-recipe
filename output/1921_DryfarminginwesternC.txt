INTRODUCTION. 

It is only a comparatively few years since the vast 
plains which now comprise the prairie provinces of 
Canada were inhabited by Indians and buffalo. "Within 
the past generation this country has been settled by over 
200,000 farmers. With the exception of those who came 
from adjoining districts immediately south of the inter- 
national boundary these farmers have had to face con- 
ditions that were entirely new to them. The farm prac- 
tices to which they were accustomed were altogether 
different from those required by the soil and climate of 
the western plains. There has been, therefore, a strong 
demand for information as to the best kinds of grain 
and other crops to grow and the best system of cultiva- 
tion under which to grow them. 

Among the experimenters and teachers who have done 
such splendid work in discovering and making known the 
best farm practices for the Canadian west Professor 
Bracken has taken a place in the front rank. For ten 
years before his appointment to the position of President 
of the Manitoba Agricultural College he was Professor 
of Field Husbandry at the College of Agriculture, Uni- 
versity of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon. The plan of the 
experimental fartoi at that institution, one of the most 
comprehensive and scientific on the continent, was 
devised by him. The results obtained from his own 
experiments, and the experiments at other stations both 
in Canada and the United States, together with the

experience of successful Great Plains farmers, have been 
drawn upon to furnish the material for Crop Production 
in Western Canada, published last year, and Dry Farm- 
ing in Western Canada. The two books furnish a reliable 
guide to success in the production of field crops under 
Great Plains conditions.

PREFACE. 

When the manuscript for "Crop Production in West- 
ern Canada" was first prepared it included not only the 
chapters relating to Crops and Cropping Practices which 
appear in it, but also several others dealing with the soil 
and its management under Western conditions. When 
it was discovered that the whole would make a book con- 
taining nearly 800 pages, it was considered inadvisable 
to publish it in one volume. Accordingly the material 
was divid-ed and that having to do directly with crops 
was published in 1919 under the title referred to. The 
part which treats of the soil and its management appears 
in this volume. 

The substance of the different chapters of the book is 
drawn from lectures and addresses delivered either at 
the University of Saskatchewan or at Agricultural Meet- 
ings at different places in Western Canada or tlie 
Western States during the past ten years. For the 
contributed portions the author is very greatly indebted 
to Professor Hansen of the University of Saskatchewan 
for the chapter on "The Soil"; to W. H. Fairfield, 
Superintendent of the Experimental Farm, Lethbridge, 
Alta., for that on "Irrigation" and to ten of the leading 
agronomists of the Great Plains Region of Canada and 
the United States for that on "Lessons from Experience". 
He is also indebted to the Canadian and United States 
Departments of Agriculture, to many State Experiment 
Stations, several Dominion Experimental Farms, all of

viii. PREFACE 

the Western Provincial Departments of Agriculture and 
the Dominion Meteorological Service for date or illustra- 
tions used, or for assistance given in the preparation of 
the manuscript. To the many private individuals who 
in one way or another have been of assistance, his thanks 
are also due. 

The many imperfections of the book are known full 
well to the writer. It is being published not because 
it contains the last word on successful farm practice in 
the west, but rather because it presents under one cover 
a more or less complete statement of our present know- 
ledge concerning the methods of producing crops at a 
profit under relatively dry conditions. It is hoped that 
the book may be found of some value to all farmers and 
students who are interested in the agricultural problems 
of the Prairie Provinces.

Dry Farming in Western 
Canada 

CHAPTER I. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRY FARMING 

Previous to fifty years ago lands having less than 20 
inches of precipitation per year were generally con- 
sidered unfit for crop production, except where artifi- 
cially watered at great cost by irrigation ditches. "Within 
the memory of men now living, the practice of crop 
growing in semi-arid regions, — those receiving between 
10 and 20 inches of rainfall per year — ^has developed, 
until at present much of the so-called "dry land" of 
earlier days is in many countries being successfully crop- 
ped as a result of the intelligent application of success- 
ful dry farming practices. 

One quarter of the earth's surface receives less than 10 
inches of precipitation annually. Rather more than one- 
quarter receives from 10 to 20 inches. On about one- 
fifth of the land area between 20 and 40 inches falls and 
' on one-fifth between 40 and 80 inches, while the balance, 
about 5 per cent, of the total, has a precipitation of over 
80 inches per year. The climate of Western Canada falls

in the second class; judged by the rainfall it is, except 
for some small areas, ^^semi-arid'\ 

1. Dry Farming Defined. — Dry farming is a popular 
term used to designate the methods of crop and soil 
. management found to be profitable in areas of light rain- 
fall. The specific practices which together comprise the 
system are not new, but the organization of them and 
their intensive application in areas of low rainfall have 
resulted within the last generation in giving to the 
system the special name "dry farming". This system 
has accomplished much in the semi-arid regions of North 
America, even though its most intelligent practice does 
not make crops grow in the absence of rain. Dry farm- 
ing is nothing more nor less than the employment of 
common-sense methods of meeting the rainfall con- 
ditions that exist by practices that have been shown to 
result in increased yields or greater profit. 

To those who have the inclination to search them out 
the secrets of dry farming, if such its principles may be 
called, are as an open page ; to others the attempt to farm 
in areas having less than 15 inches of precipitation is 
not likely to prove an easy road to wealth unless they 
are fortunate enough to have successful neighbors whose 
methods they may imitate. An understanding of its 
principles combined with the will and experience neces- 
sary to their application are fundamental necessities to 
successful dry farm practice. 

The factor that generally controls the yield on the 
poor soils of humid climates is plant food ; in northern 
climates the absence of sufficient heat is frequently the 
limiting factor; while in dry areas the thing that limits 
the yield more frequently than any other is lack of suf- 
ficient moisture. The more important practices of crop 



THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRY FARMING 3 




r 



4 DRY FARMING 

growing in humid regions relate to the maintenance or 
increase of the supply of plant food in the soil ; in north- 
ern climates the chief consideration, at least in the grow- 
ing of cereals, is to get them ripe before fall frost comes ; 
but in dry areas cropping practices are primarily con- 
cerned with making the best possible use of the moisture 
that falls. 

The principles underlying crop production are the 
same the world over, but the relative supply of plant 
food, heat and moisture under different climatic and 
soil conditions determines the relative importance of the 
different farm practices that are commonly used in 
growing crops. The supply of the factor that generally 
limits the yield in any given region largely determines 
the general trend of farm practice there, and, as in the 
ease of the semi-arid regions, sometimes gives to the 
practices followed the name by which the system is com- 
monlj^ known. 

2. History of Dry Farming. — Before the present dry 
farming movement began, the Chinese on the dry lands 
of Western China and the American Indians in the arid 
States and in parts of Mexico are known to have grown 
crops under very dry conditions. It is reported also 
that crops were produced in the dry parts of northern 
Africa without irrigation. The ancient civilization of 
the Orient, the Euphrates Valley, Palestine and Egypt 
developed in dry climates, but chiefly in areas where 
irrigation was practised. It is probable that many of 
the dry farming practices are very old, but such meth- 
ods as may have been used in early days must have been 
largely lost to Americans, most of whom came from 
humid countries. 

The recent development in America does not appear 



THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRY FARMING 5 

to have been based on any knowledge of ancient methods. 
Here the system grew up independently in each of four 
different parts of the continent, (1) in the State of 
Utah, in the southern part of the inter-mountain region, 
(2) in western Kansas and Nebraska, the central part of 
the great plains, (3) in Western Canada, in the northern . 
great plains, and (4) in California and Oregon. In each^ 
of these areas a system of crop growing developed ap- 
parently without knowledge of the methods followed in 
any of the others, until the popular "dry farming" move- 
ment was initiated within the last thirty years. 

To the Mormons of Utah belongs the distinction of be- 
ing the first civilized people to grow crops on "dry" land 
in America. Upon their arrival in Salt Lake City in 
1847 only irrigated land was used for crop growing, but 
in the sixties it was observed that cultivated land above 
the ditch was capable of producing fair crops without 
irrigation. In the early eighties dry farming became an 
established system in many of the unirrigated portions 
of the state. 

In California dry land cultivation commenced in the 
late sixties. Two decades later the colonization of much 
of the dry land of Nebraska and Kansas was attempted 
without success, but in the late eighties more satisfactory 
practices came into vogue and the tide of emigration 
commenced to return to the abandoned homesteads of 
the earlier era only to be turned eastward again by un- 
favorable seasons in the middle nineties. It was about 
this time that H, W. Campbell of "Dry Farm" fame 
■ was getting his early experience in the dry part of South 
Dakota. The ideas he developed there and later in Ne- 
braska, where summer tillage frequently gave him large- 
ly increased yields, were organized and published at 



6 DRY FARMING 

various times during the first few years of the new 
I'eritury. 

In Western Canada the colonization that followed the 
building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the eighties 
slowly spread itself westward from the Red River 
Valley. The first settlements developed along the North 
Dakota boundary, along the main line of the Canadian 
Pacific Railway west to Qu'Appelle and Moose Jaw and 
to the northwest in the Yorkton and Prince Albert dis- 
'triets. It was in the Qu'Appelle Valley that the first 
organized effort to introduce the summerfallow into gen- 
eral farm practice originated. At the time of the last 
Riel rebellion in 1885 most of the settlers hired out their 
horses and oxen with the military transport, the financial 
allowance being so much more than they hoped to get 
from the cultivation of their land. A few remained be- 
hind and after putting in what crop they could, com- 
menced to plow the land that was still unsown. The fol- 
lowing year, 1886, it was observed that the land which 
had borne no crop the previous season, but which had 
lain fallow, produced a much better crop than the other. 
This marked the beginning of the summerfallow as a 
recognized good farming practice in the central Can- 
adian West. The methods of fallowing were later studied 
and improved upon by Mr. Angus McKay, who, from 
1886 to 1917, was Superintendent of the Experimental 
Farm at Indian Head. 

It is interesting to note that while the farmers of 
Saskatchewan have been given credit for being the first 
to practise the fallow system extensively in Western Can- 
ada, the benefits of this practice were not unknown 
to the Selkirk settlers, the first white people to take up 
land in the Canadian prairies. 



THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRY FARMING 7 

In "The Beginnings of Agriculture on the Prairies" 
Dr. E. H. Oliver, who carefully examined the early re- 
cords of the Selkirk settlers, states as follows : "After a 
series of trials on the part of the settlers it was found 
that fall plowing and fallow yielded the best crops. 
Alexander Ross, who could secure only 52 bushels from 
10 bushels by the spring plowing of a worn-out field, was 
able, out of the second field, left fallow for two consecu- 




Fig. 3. — ^Map Shovrtng the Northern Limits of Some Crops and Trees'. 

tive years, during which it .was plowed three times, to 
secure no less than 280 bushels from 8 bushels sown." It 
thus appears that while the practice of fallowing was 
brought forcibly to the attention of the Saskatchewan 
pioneers after the last Riel Rebellion and that it was not 
until this time that it became a general practice, yet its 
value was not unknown in the West as early as the mid- 
dle of the last century. 

In recent years the United States Department of Agri- 
culture, the different State Experiment Stations, the Ex-

perimental Farms of the Canadian prairies and the Dry 
Farming Congress have each studied the practices of 
Dry Farming and each has contributed much towards 
putting the system on a permanent basis. How much of 
its success is due to the organization and application of 
the_J[acts^ofJh^seience of crop production, and how 
much to otEerfactors such as the higher prices of the 
last twenty years, and the contribution of the implement

companies in the way of labor saving machinery, history 
alone will determine. 

3. Where Dry Farming Applies.— One or more of the 
established dry farming practices should be used wher- 
ever moisture is the limiting factor in the yield of crops. 
This condition, of course, obtains chiefly in the areas of 
low rainfall, but may be found in other places where 



THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRY FARMING 9 

excessive evaporation or periods of drought or other 
cause results in moisture becoming the limiting factor. 

The precipitation zones of Western Canada are indi- 
cated in the following chapter. The boundaries of 
these are based upon the limited rainfall and snowfall 
data available. They will, no doubt, be modified and 
more accurately located as more records beaome avail- 
able, but in the meantime they furnish us with the ap- 
proximate boundaries of the precipitation zones. 

The areas of different evaporation cannot be mapped 
owing to lack of data. The Chinook region, is, how- 
ever, generally believed to have the greatest evapora- 
tion, and the northeastern portion of the Prairie Pro- 
vinces to have the least.^ 

Judging from the precipitation records and the data 
for spring and fall frosts as well as from the costly ex- 
periences of farmers, it would appear that wliile several 
of the practices of dry farming should be applied wher- 
ever land is tilled, the extreme practices of this system 
should be applied in Western Canada only in the 
Chinook belt, in a modified form they should be used 
in the prairie area outside the Chinook belt, while in a 
still more modified form they may be used in eastern 
Manitoba, the park belt and the wooded areas. (See 
"Nature's Map of the Prairie Provinces"). 

It should perhaps be emphasized here that in grow- 
ing grain crops in places where fall frosts are more to 
be feared than drought, less attention should be given to 
moisture storage and more to getting crops ripe. Both 
moisture conservation and early maturity may be de- 
sirable but where added moisture results in too late 
ripening it must be sacrificed in areas where crops are 
grown for their seeds. If forage crops only are to be 



^^ DRY FARMING 

grown, or where grain crops are to be grown for hay 
dry farmmg may be practised even in the far No th bT 
e use w.th these crops maturity is not an essentTal 'con 
dition for either a good yield or good quality. 



CHAPTER II. 

THE CLIMATE OF WESTERN CANADA 

In Its Relation To Crop Production. 

Under good systems of management three sets of 
factors determine the productiveness of crops in any 
region : 

1st. The climatic conditions. 
2nd. The soil conditions, and 
3rd. The suitability of the crops grown. 

4. Climatic Conditions the Chief Causes of Low Yields. — 
In the year 1914 the small amount and the unfavorable 
monthly distribution of precipitation caused a crop fail- 
ure in the drier parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In 
1907 and 1911 early fall frosts lowered the net profit 
on the western grain crops to perilously near the zero 
mark. In 1918 a July frost completely destroyed many 
thousands of acres of wheat in the blossom stage in the 
northern parts of the Prairie Provinces; while in 1916 
a combination of high temperatures, high precipitation 
and high atmospheric humidity in the months of June, 
July and August provided very favorable conditions 
for the development and spread of rust and thus lowered 

11 



12 DRY FARMING 

the value of the "Western Canadian wheat crop between 
fifty and one hundred million dollars. 

The climatic conditions, at least in the first few years 
of land cultivation, are among the chief causes of poor 
crops, and unfortunately they are largely beyond man's 
power to change. This, however, is but another reason 
why our climate should be better understood. If we can- 
not change its undesirable features perhaps we can avoid 
them; if it has any favorable aspects perhaps we can 
take greater advantage of them. A knowledge of the 
essential facts concerning our climate should enable us 
gradually to choose more suitable crops and to adapt our 
rotation and management practices to the climatic condi- 
tions that have been fixed for us and that cannot be 
altered by us. 

5. The Factors of Climate. — The term "climate" means 
the sum total of the atmospheric conditions that make 
up our "weather". Weather is "the condition of the 
atmosphere at a given time or over a limited period", 
while climate is a more general term meaning the average 
condition of the weather for the different seasons of the 
year. 

The chief determiners of climate are latitude, altitude 
and relationship to large bodies of water, forests and 
mountain ranges. It is sufficient here to say that ours 
is a "continental" or inland climate, in a northern lati- 
tude, and far removed from the moderating influences 
of large bodies of water, but influenced considerably by 
our nearness to the Rocky Mountains, and by gradual 
variations in altitude ranging from less than 1,000 feet 
in the east and far north to more than 4,000 feet in the 
upper parts of the foothills. 



THE CLIMATE OF WESTERN CANADA 13 

The chief factors of climate in order of their relative 
importance to the agriculture of Western Canada are: 

1. Precipitation: (a) amount per year; (b) geo- 
graphic distribution; (c) monthly distribution; (d) 
form (rain, snow, hail, dew) ; (e) variations from the 
average; and (f) evaporation. 

2. Temperature: (a) the number of days between 
spring and fall frosts; (b) the average monthly tempera- 
ture; (c) the range of annual and daily temperature. 

3. Wind: (a) velocity; (b) temperature; (c) humid- 
ity, and (d) direction. 

4. Atmospheric humidity. 

5. Light during the growing season. 

6. Altitudes and forests. 

6. Importance of Precipitation. — Moisture in the soil is 
essential to crop production. It is needed both as a plant 
food and as a carrier of plant food. Under semi-arid 
conditions more than a quarter of a ton of water is taken 
in through the roots and passed out through the leaves 
in order to carry enough food into the plant to produce 
one pound of "dry matter". 

One acre inch of water weighs about 113 tons. As- 
suming that 700 pounds* is the average requirement for 
one pound of dry matter in wheat and, for easy calcula- 
tion, that half the dry matter of wheat is in the stems 
• and leaves, it would take 1,400 pounds of water to pro- 

•Recent investigations by Hopkins at Olds, Alberta, indicate that 
much less than this amount is required on rich prairie soil in 
high latitudes. 



14 



DRY FARMING 



duce one pound of threshed grain, or over one ton to 
produce 1>4 pounds of wheat. At this rate if it were 
all conserved and utilized, one acre inch of water would 
produce over 2>^ bushels of wheat and 8 inches would 
produce at least 20 bushels per acre. 

Our precipitation is about twice 8 inches, or more, 
and we crop our land only three times in four years, or

(See 



twice in three years, yet our average yield equals less 
than the amount eight inches of moisture might produce. 
The loss through "run-off", seepage, evaporation and 
transpiration through weeds accounts for this poor 
showing. 

From these figures it will be apparent that the pre- 
cipitation in Western Canada is one of the chief limiting 
factors in crop yields ; it suggests the desirability of more 
efficient control of the limited amount of moisture that 
faUs.

some of the older agricultural regions from which our 

settlers have come. 

(2) That nearly the whole of the Canadian west re- 
ceives more than 13 inches and less than 20 inches per 
year. 

(3) That the area of lowest precipitation is in south- 
eastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, and 
the supply increases in every direction from this centre. 
The increase is greater both east and west than north. 

The two chief inferences from the data are, — 1st, 
that the storage, conservation and efficient utilization of 
moisture are of very great importance, and .2nd, that 
extreme practices of "dry farming" would seem de- 
sirable in the drier areas.

8. Geographic Distribution of Precipitation. — The fig- 
ures reported in the preceding section show that all 
parts of Western Canada are not equally favored with 
respect to precipitation. The precipitation map shows 
the outlines of what may be called the moisture zones in 
the three Prairie Provinces. While insufficient data are 
available to insure that the boundaries represented are 
absolutely correct, yet the map is at least a safe general 
guide to the precipitation zones. 

9. Monthly Distribution of Precipitation. — The total 
precipitation per year is not a satisfactory measure of

vinces as compared with low precipitation at Vancouver for the same 
months and the average distribution throughout the year at Toronto. 



the moisture supply available for crops. The propor- 
tion that falls in the season the crop is growing is of 
far greater importance than the annual amount. The 
following table gives the average precipitation per 
month for several years at a number of points.

THE CLIMATE OF WESTERN CANADA 19 

From the figures in table I. a number of very im- 
portant observations may be made. Among these are : 

(1) From 50 to 60 per cent, of the total precipitation 
falls in the four "growing" months, May, June, July 
and August, In the districts of heaviest precipitation 
this is nearly as much as is received in the same period 
in Ontario cr in the midland counties of England. 




Fig. 10. — Average Depth of Snowfall in Western Canada. 
— From Meteorological Service Reports. , 



(2) June and early July is the rainy season. This fact 
is of considerabale importance in relation to the conserva- 
tion of moisture by fallowing. It is the chief factor that 
determines the best time to plow the fallow and the 
character of the other necessary work that should be 
done on it, 

(3) The spring and autumn seasons are usually quite 
dry. The former suggests the necessity of having the 



20 DRY FARMING 

seed bed in a good moist condition at seeding time, 
while the dry autumn results (a) in unusually favor- 
able conditions for harvesting, curing and threshing 
grain crops, (b) in seriously lessening the amount of 
fall pasturage secured from perennial crops, and (c) in 
lessening the value of fall plowing as a means of con- 
serving moisture and causing weed seeds to germinate. 

It is interesting to note also that, as compared with 
either Toronto or Vancouver, (see map), while our total 
precipitation is much less, the monthly "distribution" 
is very favorable. In fact, with either the Vancouver or 
Toronto type of distribution here, we should be unable 
to produce crops profitably. 

The monthly distribution and average annual snow- 
fall at representative points is as follows: —

The average depth of snow in the southern parts of all 
three prairie provinces is clearly indicated in the snow- 
fall map. The melting of the snow is more frequent and

the evaporation of the resulting moisture is greater in 
the prairie areas than in the wooded and semi-wooded 
parts, and the most frequent melting and greatest 
evaporation occurs in the Chinook belt of southern Al- 
berta and southwestern Saskatchewan. 

10, The Form in which the Precipitation Occurs,. — 
Precipitation includes all the moisture that falls from 
the clouds to the earth. Rainfall is the most important 
but snowfall is also important. Hail and dew are other 
forms. 

Snowstorms occur earlier than November and later 
than March, in fact, flurries may occur after tho crop 
is up or before it is threshed. And snow tliat falls after 
March and before November may interfere with farm 
operations but it always functions as rain so far as the 
farmer is concerned and is generally very much ap- 
preciated by him when it comes in the spring. 

The snowfall generally ranges between 30 inches and 
60 inches per year, although less than 15 inches was re- 
ported twice at Battleford and more than 80 inches 
twice at Winnipeg. The area of lowest average snow- 
fall runs in a northwesterly direction from southeastern 
Saskatchewan to northeastern Alberta, including Areola, 
Regina, Saskatoon and Battleford. The amount in- 
creases rapidly in a northeasterly direction from this 
area but less rapidly in a southwesterly direction until 
western Alberta is reached. It has already been pointed 
out that from 50 to 60 per cent, of the total precipita- 
tion falls as rain in the May-August period, and that 
April, September and October precipitation is chiefly 
in the form of rain. In the prairie area any snow that 
falls in October usually melts in a few days but it has 
^en. known to remain on the ground from the early

days of this month and to occasion considerable loss as 
a result of interference with the harvest of potatoes and 
roots as well as with the late threshing of cereals. The 
possibility of snowfall at this time should also have an 
important bearing on the plans of the stockman for 
the feeding and management of his animals. 

Hail storms 
are most fre- 
quent between 
the middle of 
July and the 
middle of Au- 
gust. They may 
occur early in 
June or as late 
as the last of 
Septemjber. As 
to whether some 
districts are 
" subject " t v» 
hail and others 
not, there is 
much discussion 
but little reli- 
able data. Most 
hail insurance 
companies 
charge slightly 
higher premiums in some parts of the foothill country 
and immediately east of it than in the central and 
eastern parts. The possibility of hail suggests the ad- 
visability of not putting all one's eggs in a single 
basket^ in other words of having some source of reve-

nue other than a grain crop. "We cannot insure 
against drought or frost but insurance of grain crops 
against hail damage is possible and advisable for all who 
cannot afford to lose a crop. 

11. Wide Variations from the Average Precipitation. 
— Three instances will serve to illustrate the fact that 
wide variations from the average precipitation are likelj 
to occur. The average at Calgary for 31 years is 16.54 
inches but in one year (1892) it was only 7.91 inches 
while in another (1902) it was 34.57 inches. The aver- 
age for Qu'Appelle is 19.19 inches, but in 1886 it was 
10.14 and 1916, 26.54. The average for Winnipeg for 31 
years is 20.50, but in 1886 only 14.84 inches fell, while in 
1899 the precipitation was 27.19 inches. Even the 
five-year averages depart widely from the normal, 
the variation appearing to be greatest in western Al- 
berta and least in eastern Manitoba. Because of these 
wide variations from normal precipitation a more 
diversified system of cropping is likely to prove less 
risky and therefore in the long run is to be preferred. 

12. Evaporation. — One of the chief reasons why crops 
have suffered less from drought in the northern end of 
the Great Plains region than in those parts of the south 
where the precipitation is the same, is the lower evapor- 
ation in this latitude. Higher yields are invariably 
secured in the north than from the same precipitation 
on equally good soils in more southern latitudes. The 
amount of total precipitation is not as satisfactory in- 
formation as the amount of the "net" precipitation, 
which is the total less the evaporation from the soil. Un- 
fortunately data on evaporation is not yet available for 
points in Western Canada.

13. Dry and Wet Years at Saskatoon. — The monthly 
distribution of precipitation at Saskatoon for the two 
years 1914 and 1915 and the average for the years 1904- 
1914 are as follows : 

Table III. — Monthly Distribution of Precipitation at Saskatoon in 
1914 and 1916.

.70 1.04 3.45 2.45 2.20 1.25 .77 .66 .68 15.17 

The total precipitation while not very different in the 
years 1914 and 1915 was rather greater in 1914, yet the 
wheat yield was 15 bushels less in 1914 than in 1915. 
The former is even yet remembered as the "dry" year, 
while the latter was with one exception the best year we 
have ever had. The difference in yields was due chiefly 
to the unfavorable distribution of moisture in 1914, 
Note that the "June" rains were but little more than 
half as heavy as the average and that the October 
and November rains which came after harvest were 
nearly three times as heavy as the average. The heavy 
crop in 1915 was probably due in large measure to the 
heavy precipitation in the fall of the preceding year. 
This kept the crop growing well through the early sum- 
mer of 1915, and the timely and sufficient showers of 
late summer "filled" the heads. 

14. Temperature Necessary for Germination and Growth. 
— The temperatures in degrees F. at which seeds 
germinate and at which crops grow best is indicated by 
the following data from Haberlandt : —

Pumpkins 52 93 115 61-60 98-111 111-122 

Melons 60-65 88-98 

It will be observed that the grain crops and peas 
will germinate and grow at relatively low temper- 
atures, while corn demands more heat and truck crops, 
like melons, still higher temperatures both for germina- 
tion and for growth. 

15. The Measure of the Heat Supply. — The chief source 
of heat is the sun, although the stars and the interior of 
the earth also slightly increase the surface temperatures. 
The sun's heat reaches the earth by direct radiation, by 
radiation and conduction from the atmosphere, and by 
warm rains. The soil temperature is affected also by the 
heat given off from decaying plant tissues. The meas- 
ure of the heat supply is the temperature, and the 
temperature data that chiefly concern the farmer are, 
(1) the average and extreme dates of the last spring 
and first fall frosts, (2) the average temperature of the 
growing season, (3) the extremes of temperature in the 
growing season, and (4) the total amount of heat re- 
ceived during the growing season. The time and 
severity of the last spring and first fall frosts fix the 
length of the growing season for cereals and together 
■ with the average temperature of the frost-free season 
determine, approximately at least, the total units of 



As quoted by Lyon, Fippin & Buckman in "Soils, their Proper- 
ties and Management."

heat received from the sun during the growing season. 
At the same time the extremes of low temperature with- 
in the growing period limit the successful growth of the 
warm weather crops such as corn, sorghum, Sudan 
grass and certain of the heat-loving vegetables. 

16. The Temperature Zones of Canada. — The average 
temperatures for the year and for the summer for the 
whole of Canada is shown in Fig. 12. From this it will

be observed that southern Alberta and southwestern 
Saskatchewan and the southern part of the Red River 
Valley are the warmest for both the year and the sum- 
mer, and that the temperature decreases in a north- 
easterly or a northerly direction, but that in the direc- 
tion of northern Alberta and northwestern Saskatch- 
ewan the temperature decreases less rapidly than in 
northern Manitoba.

17. Spring and Fall Frosts in Western Canada. — The 
number of days between the last spring frost and the 
first fall frost and the average date of each is perhaps 
the most useful temperature information the grain

logical records show that southeastern Alberta, south- 
western Saskatchewan (and the Red River valley of 
Manitoba) have a longer frost-free period than any 



28 DRY FARMING 

other part of the West and that the number of 
days between frosts decreases in all directions from 
there but less rapidly in an easterly direction. The 
driest part of the West is also the warmest. Too great 
heed cannot be given to these facts. They suggest that 
extreme dry farming practices are applicable in the dry 
warm area, but that "northern farming" or a system 
that will lessen the danger from frost should be practised 
in the more humid parts that have but a short time be- 
tween spring and fall frosts. 

The records of the Provincial Department of Agri- 
culture at Regina for the ten years ending 1917 show 
that in the Province of Saskatchewan the soil was suf- 
ficiently thawed out by April 18th that the seeding of 
wheat became general on that date. During these ten 
years the earliest date on which wheat seeding was gen- 
eral was April 9th and the latest date, May 10th. No 
reliable records are available to show the average date 
at which tillage of the soil is prevented by freezing in 
the fall. Generally in the central west plowing may be 
continued till the end of October, sometimes till early 
December, but in exceptional years the ground has 
frozen hard as early as the first week of October. When 
the ground is dry in the fall low temperatures do not 
harden it as they do moist soil, consequently tillage may 
be continued much later than when the soil is wet. 

The temperature records for Sasckatchewan for the 
twelve years 1904 to 1915 report only one July frost. It 
is known, however, that in some low spots in at least 
two of these years small patches of wheat were frosted 
when the plants were in bloom in July. The only July 
frost that did serious harm to grain crops over a large 
area occurred in 1918, when a considerable percentage

of the crop in the northern parts of the Prairie Pro- 
vinces (chiefly Alberta and Saskatchewan) was injured 
by a heavy frost on the night of July 24th. 

The purpose of instancing these facts is to show that 
ths "average" time of frost is sometimes widely departed 
from, both in the favorable and unfavorable directions. 
This suggests fR05T5 of 5° 

even more forci- 
bly than the 
short time be- 
tween frosts, 
the desirability 
of (1) growing 
"safer" crops, 
and (2) devel- 
oping a more di- 
- versified agri- 
culture, partic- 
ularly in the 
temperature zones showing the greatest variations from 
the average. 

18. Frost Resistance of Different Crops. — Cereals will 
withstand heavy spring frosts but not fall frosts. Root 
crops and rape will withstand heavy fall frosts but 
suffer considerably from heavy spring frosts. Corn 
and potatoes will withstand neither, although potatoes 
will live through frosts that kill corn. Flax and peas 
suffer considerably from both spring and fall frosts, 
while perennial grasses and legumes will withstand very 

, low temperatures at either season. 

19. The Average Temperature of the Growing Period. 
— The average temperatures at representative points for 
each month in the year are indicated on the diagram,

and the actual figures are quoted in the table that fol- 
lows. These show very favorable temperatures for 
growth in summer even at far north points such as Fort 
Simpson. The more rapid fall of autumn temperatures 
and the lower temperatures in spring, in the northern 
latitudes, indicate a shorter growing season. By com- 
pafing the monthly rainfall and monthly temperature 
illustrations it will be seen that the months of highest 
temperature follow closely the months of greatest rain- 
fall. To this fortunate "accident" of climate is largely 
due such success as has attended the efforts of the crop 
grower in the Canadian West.

20. The Total Heat Received During the Period of 
Growth.— The total amount of heat received during the 
growing season may be determined by multiplying the 
number of days of growth by the difference between the 
temperature required for plant growth and the average 
daily temperature for the period. The result is spoken 
of as the "accumulated temperatures" which is the sum 
of the "day degrees" of temperature between the time in

th? spring when plant growth starts and the time in the 
fall when it stops. Unstead worked this out from the 
meagre data that were available with the results 
indicated on the map.! In arriving at these re- 
sults he arbitrarily took the time in the spring

or 41 °F. and the time in the fall when it de- 
scends to 10°C. or 50°F., as being the time when 
plant growth starts and stops respectively. 

In the report of the same investigation he pointed out 
that at Ottawa, Red Fife would mature with an ac- 
cumulated temperature of 1330 degrees, Ladoga with 
1210 degrees and Early Riga with 1030 degrees. With 
our longer hours of sunlight here and the very early 
varieties that are now available the possibility of grow-

ing wheat very far north in Alberta seems promising. 
How profitable it may be, the average date of the first 
fall frost and the percentage of seasons that are free 
from summer frosts will largely determine. 

21. Wind Velocity. — The wind velocity averages higher 
on the open plains than in the park belt and wooded 
areas. In some seasons it does serious injury to tender 
plants and shrubs by causing the soil to drift. Accord- 
ing to Cross* the average velocity ranges in different 
parts of the West from 5.1 to 13.3 miles per hour, while 
the average maximum ranges from 30 to 57 miles per 
hour. 

22. The Chinook Wind.— The temperature of the south- 
westerly winds is the highest and that of the north- 
easterly the lowest. The Chinook, a warm southwest 
wind, is often responsible in winter for removing the 
snow covering very soon after it comes. This is per- 
haps favorable for the rancher but not so for the crop 
grower. In summer this wind sometimes does serious 
injury to crops in southern Alberta and southwestern 
Saskatchewan, occasionally as far east as Moose Jaw and 
Saskatoon. It is reported that it is occasionally felt in 
milder form as far north as the Peace River Valley and 
upper Mackenzie basin. 

23. Humidity of the Wind.— Little data is available 
concerning the humidity of the atmosphere in these 
winds but experience has shown that the southwest and 
west ones are very dry while those from other directions 
are generally more humid, especially the east winds. 



In "Climate and Rainfall", by J. F. Cross in "Prairie Provinces 
of Canada", Sells Lt^. 



THE CLIMATE OF WESTERN CANADA 33 

24. Wind Direction. — Mr. J. F. Cross,* Superintendent 
of St. John's College Observatory at Winnipeg has this 
to say on the general subject of winds in the Prairie 
Provinces : 

"The typical wind of the prairie section is north- 
west, that of the Chinook (southern Alberta and south- 
western Saskatchewan) southwest. Modifications of 
these arise in several districts owing to local peculiarities, 
and velocities also vary considerably. . . . Generally, 
however, in Manitoba the direction tends north or south 
with almost continuous moderate velocity and a num- 
ber of light gales; in Saskatchewan the westerly type 
begins to appear, while in northern Alberta the most 
prevalent wind is due west. In southern Alberta and 
especially in districts adjacent to the Rocky Mountains 
the direction is usually southwest and the velocity rarely 
exceeds 30 miles an hour. The force of the air move- 
ments on the whole is greater in places of low latitude. 
Hurricanes are, however, practically non-existent in the 
Canadian West, the one notable exception being the 
cyclone which visited Regina during the summer of 1912 
and caused considerable damage in the business section 
of the city." 

25. Atmospheric Humidity. — The meteorological data 
on the atmospheric humidity of the West is very meagre. 
In brief, it indicates that our atmosphere is very dry, 
the driest being in the areas of lowest precipitation and 
highest temperature, viz., southeastern Alberta and 
southwestern Saskatchewan. 

A dry atmosphere increases evaporation. This is 
noticeable, chiefly in the "Chinook" region where after 



* In "The Prairie Provinces of Canada'' 



34 DRY FARMING 

melting the snows of winter, the warm dry wind sucks 
up the moisture very rapidly. The dry atmosphere is, 
however, not always a misfortune. This is one of the 
causes of high quality in wheat and also one of the chief 
causes of the relatively small damage from rust and 
other fungous diseases in the dry parts of the West. 
Carleton,* referring to this point, states that "A heavy 
stand of wheat in humid districts is favorable to rust. 
Under these conditions it should be noted that the 
atmospheric humidity is the influencing factor 

"In this district (the spring wheat belt of Canada and 
the United States) because of the deep black soil and 
dry, hot summers, there is grown the highest grade of 
common spring wheat in the world excepting the spring 
wheats of the middle Volga district of Russia, which are 
very similar," 

26. Long- Hours of Sunlight in the Growing Season. — 

Light is essential for plant growth. Without it plants 
cannot manufacture their food. Man cannot control the 
light except in a negative way by preventing weeds and 
other obstacles shading useful plants. Two phases of 
this question are, however, very interesting. The first is 
the length of the day in summer in northern latitudes, 
and the second the relative lack of clouds in this climate. 

The number of possible hours of sunshine daily dur- 
ing June, July and August at various places is indi- 
cated on the sunshine map. The long days of summer 
and the relative lack of cloudiness in Western Canada 
encourages rapid growth and makes possible the matur- 
ing of crops in much less time than people of southern 



In "The Small GraSins", by Cairleton, 



THE CLIMATE OF WESTERN CANADA 35 



climates can imagine. These conditions, together with 
the favorable monthly distribution of precipitation, are 
largely responsible for the measure of success that has 
been attained in crop growing in our northern semi-arid 
climate. 




Fig. 16. — Hours of Possible Sunshine Daily in Summer. 

26a. The Effect of Latitude and Altitude on Tempera- 
ture. — Where no other factors interfere the average de- 
crease in temperature is approximately three degrees for 
every 100 miles one goes in a northerly direction. It 
is seldom, however, that this ratio is not affected by 
changes in altitude or relation to forests or large bodies 
of water. 

The lowering of temperature as a result of increase 
in elevation averages one degree for every 300 feet. The 
eiSfect of latitude and altitude is clearly shown by the 
height of the permanent snow line above sea level. At 
the north pole this line is at sea level. At the southern 



36 DRY FARMING 

boundary of Canada it may be seen in the Rocky Moun- 
tains at an altitude of 6,000 to 8,000 feet and at the 
equator it is found only after reaching the height of 
16,000 to 18,000 feet. 

26b. The Effects of Forests on Climate. — The effect of 
forests on climate is to lessen the extremes of precipita- 
tion, evaporation, wind velocity and to some extent the 
temperature. How much the forests of North-western 
Canada affect our climate it is difficult to estimate. In the 
practice of farming its greatest influence is probably 
found in lessening the wind velocity and thereby the 
evaporation and danger from soil erosion. This favor- 
able effect is, of course, greatest in the wooded areas and 
least in the prairie and Chinook belts. 






^ CHAPTER III. 



THE SOIL 



By Roy Hansen, M.S., Professor of Soils, University of 
Saskatchewan, Saskatoon. 

27. The Role of the Soil. — The existence of mankind is 
dependent upon three things : the earth, the atmosphere 
and the sunshine. Of these, only the earth is subject to 
the will of man, to conserve or destroy according to his 
knowledge or ignorance. And of the earth, it is with the 
shallow surface crust, but a few inches in thickness, 
which we designate as "the soil", that we are most con- 
cerned. The soil must support the plant world which in 
turn supports the animal world, including mankind. 
Thus the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the 
timber that provides us shelter come ultimately from the 
soil. The soil, therefore, is our greatest resource, the 
very foundation of life and prosperity. 

The growing plant in its endeavor to reproduce its 
kind, the chief function of all life, had need of five 
essentials : ( 1 ) a place to take root, that it may support 
its aerial parts; (2) food, as important to plants as it 
is to animals; (3) moisture; (4) heat; (5) light. 

With the exception of light the soil is concerned in 
each of these essentials. The root system of the plant is 

37 



38 DRY FARMING 

determined by the texture of the soil. The soil must 
furnish the mineral plant food elements and nitrogen. It 
absorbs and retains the rainfall to be given up to the 
plants as needed. It absorbs and transmits heat upon 
which plant life is dependent. These factors we can in 
a large measure control by our farm practices. In order 
to know the best practices to pursue, it is essential that 
we know why and how the soil responds to different 
treatment. 

History and Physical Properties. 

28, Origin. — Geologists tell us that the earth was at 
one time a molten mass cast off with its whirling motion 
from the sun. Through many centuries this mass slowly 
cooled, the molten materials forming a crust of solid rock 
and the vapors condensing to water to form lakes and 
oceans. The rock was broken down to a disintegrated 
mass by the grinding action of the glaciers and the 
slower process of weathering. Part of this disintegrated 
material was carried away and redeposited by the wind 
or water, becoming again cemented in stratified form 
into rock. Part of it remained in place and formed the 
beginning of the soil, accumulating slowly through the 
ages by Nature's processes. 

The forces of disintegration and transportation have 
been at work during all time. The power of freezing 
and thawing in crumbling down rock is familiar to all. 
The deep crevices in granite rock with the pile of 
crumbled-off material at the base tells the story of 
Nature's work. The effects of water with its driving 
force as rain, and its dissolving and wearing action in 
flowing over rock surface are well evidenced in the

caverns and caves it cuts in stratified sandstone and lime- 
stone deposits. The wind picking up particles of sand, 
grinds and wears the rocks to powder. The atmosphere 
with its moisture and gases aids in this process of 
solution and disintegration.

& Co. 



With the coming of life upon earth, first the bacteria 
perhaps and then higher plants and animal life, new 
forces of disintegration came into play. The bacteria 
were able to feed upon the rock materials, building liv- 
ing tissue from the solid minerals which they dissolved 
and assimilated. Plants and then animals took part 
in the process, exerting in part mechanical or physical 
force, in part chemical force and in part biological force. 
With the decay of vegetable and animal matter organic 
acids were liberated and these assisted in the process. 



40 DRY FARMING 

Thus the process went on, the rock materials supporting 
plant life, and the latter contributing further to soil 
building. 

The ultimate outcome was the soil, made up as we now 
know it, of stones, gravel, sand, silt, clay and organic 
matter. These then were the final products, though we 
must not think of the process as being finished. Nature 
is constantly at work levelling mountains, disintegrat- 
ing rocks, and transporting and depositing the ma- 
terials without heed to the desires of man, indeed often 
contrary to his wishes. 

29. Soil Classification. — According to the manner of 
formation and deposition and the agencies that played 
the leading part, soils are classified as indicated in the . 
following outline — 

(1) Sedentary, formed in place: 

(a) Residual, formed in place from disinteg- 
ration of rocks. 

(b) Cumulose, formed in place by the partial 
decay and accumulation of vegetable 
matter. 

(2) Transported Soils: 

(a) Glacial soils, deposited by glaciers. 

(b) Loessial soils, deposited by the wind. 

(c) Alluvial soils, deposited by the action of 
water. 

Sedentary Soils. — As the name indicates, these are 
formed in place, no appreciable transportation from the 
location of the original rock upon which they rest having 
taken place. Sedentary soils are further subdivided in- 
to (1) residual, soils formed in place from the disinteg- 
ration of rocks; and (2) cumulose, soils formed in place 
by the partial decay and accumulation of vegetable mat- 



THE SOIL 41 

ter (plant remains). Limestone soils, productive soils 
covering ex^tensive areas in the southern and earstern 
states of the United States, are examples of residual 
soils. Frequently the limestone has completely leached 
away, the soil consisting entirely of the impurities of the 
original limestone and plant remains. Cumulose soils 
are illustrated by mucks and peats which have been 
formed under peculiar conditions, (i. e. poor drainage 
as in swamp and bog land) alloAving the partial decay 
and accumulation of plant remains, the growth of moss, 
swamp grass, etc., on top exceeding the rate of decom- 
position of the old remains, thus resulting in the de- 
position of a soil consisting largely of organic matter. 

Transported Soils. — These are likewise formed by rock 
distintegration, but the materials are removed from their 
original resting places. Chief among the agencies of 
transportation are the wind, the glaciers, and water. 

Material picked up and deposited by the wind is 
termed loess. Loessial soils occupy a large area in the 
prairies of the United States, and in depth they vary 
from a few inches to perhaps 200 feet. 

The material brought down and deposited by the 
glaciers is called glacial till or boulder clay. Soils so 
formed are more varied in character, containing fre- 
quently rounded stones and gravel along with much silt 
and fine sand, the result of the grinding action of these 
huge ice sheets, and frequently huge boulders left upon 
the open prairies. 

,. Soils deposited through the agency of water, such as 
the deltas of rivers, old lake bottoms, etc., are termed 
alluvial soils, and these generally rank among our most 
fertile soils. The delta of the Nile and the Red River 



42

Valley of the North are typical examples, the latter 
being at one time the bed of the old Lake Agassiz. 

30. Soil Types. — Soils are further divided into types 
depending upon the content of the various soil ma- 
terials. Thus we have gravels, sands, silts, clays, 
gravelly loam, sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, muck, 
peat and loam. By a loam is meant a soil having a good 
balance of the various constituents, that is, not enough 
clay to render it plastic, not enough sand to make it too 
loose and open, and with a sufficient supply of organic

matter to give a good friable texture. The percentage of 
various soil materials determines the physical character 
of the soil, i. e. the texture, the ease of cultivation, the 



THE SOIL 43 

temperature, the water-holding capacity and the porosity 
(air-space). 

31. Physical Properties of Soils. — The above classifi- 
cation depends upon the size of the soil particles and 
upon the organic matter content, these factors determin- 
ing its physical properties. Sandy soils have large 
particles predominating and this results in their loose- 
ness and openness, their non-adhesiveness. Water drains 
readily through such soils, and less is retained for crops. 
Air circulates more freely, the pore spaces are larger 
and because of this, and the fact that they hold 
less water, sandy soils are "warmer", "earlier", and 
therefore best adapted in the humid sections to truck 
farming and early vegetable gardening. 

Clays, on the other hand, are plastic, difficult to work 
when wet. This is due mainly to the extremely small 
soil particles and in part to the plastic nature of the 
material, kaolin or fire-clay, which makes up a con- 
siderable part of such soils. Clays retain more moisture, 
the particles being smaller and hence more numerous 
per given volume; the water film surrounding the 
particles is more extensive in area, hence the ability to 
hold more water. Air circulates less freely. The total 
air space is greater in clays (porosity is inversely pro- 
portional to the size of the particles), but the movement 
of air finds greater resistance. A further fact about 
clays is that though they retain more moisture, they give 
it up with less ease to plants than do sands. Plants 
will wilt in a clay soil, whereas in a sand of equal total 
moisture content, they Avould show no signs of lack of 
moisture. Thus in general clay soils are "colder", 
"later", more retentive of moisture and more difficult to 
work. 



44 DRY FARMING 

Humus, the accumulated residue of the decomposl 
tion of plant remains, plays an important role in the 
physical properties of soils. Being somewhat plasti( 
and spongy in nature, it binds the sand particles to- 
gether, giving such soils greater adhesiveness and henct 
better tilth. In clay it binds the small particles to- 
gether into larger aggregates, thereby lessening the 
plasticity and rendering them easier to work. Due tc 
its porous nature it increases the water-holding 
capacity, facilitating the, absorption and retention of 
water. It increases the pore-space, alloAving the air to 
circulate more freely in the heavier types of soil, there- 
by increasing the warmth, and making the soil ''^earlier". 
The importance of keeping up the humus content from 
the standpoint of the physical properties of the soil is, 
therefore, important; the role from the chemical and 
biological standpoints will be discussed later. 

The capillary rise of water in soils is controlled by the 
size and compactness of the soil particles. Although 
water rises more rapidly in a sandy soil because of less 
resistance, the total height to which it will rise and the 
force exerted in the upward rise are greater in the 
heavier types. Soil-packing, therefore, results in bet- 
ter capillary contact besides assisting in the decay of 
vegetable matter by the closer contact with moisture. 

32. Dry-Farming and Soil Physics. — Dry-farming puts 
into practice our knowledge concerning the physical 
properties of soil. For example we plow for summer- 
fallow before the last of the heavy summer rains come 
in order to render the soil more open and retentive of 
moisture. The use of the soil packer on fall and spring 
plowing is to lessen the air space in the soil and to 
aid in bringing the moisture up to where the seed is to 



' THE SOIL 45 

>e planted; and the object of surface cultivation, aside 
Tom controlling weeds, is to provide a satisfactory seed 
)ed containing the right amounts of moisture, heat and 
lir for germination and growth. Surface cultivation 
ilso provides a mulch which lessens to some extent the 
Tacking of the soil and thereby checks evaporation. 

- Soil Fertility or Chemistry. 

33. The Food of Plants. — Food is as important a con- 
ideration to plants as it is to animals. Animals require 
'or food vegetable matter, such as starch, sugar, fat, 
)rotein, etc., the highly organized, complex materials 
luilt up by plant life. While animals frequently eat 
mimal flesh, plant life is the primary source of food. 
Phe nutrition of plants, however, is different. They re- 
[uire as food the simple, inorganic materials derived 
rom the solution of rock materials or from the decay 
•f plant or animal remains. This food is taken up in 
skater solution, and by the plant is built up into tissue, 
.e. sugar, starch, cellulose, protein, the things for 
rhich we prize plants as food for human or stock con- 
umption, 

34. The Essential Elements. — The earth's crust is com- 
)osed of about 80 elements in varying amounts and 
ombinations or compounds. Of the 80 elements, 40 are 
Qore or less common, and 15, because of their wide 
•ccurrence in plants, soils, water and in the atmosphere, 
ve important in soil fertility. Of these 15 elements, 10 
re essential for the growth of plants; deprived of any 
t them the plant would succumb, or would, at least, be 
mable to reproduce its kind. These elements which are 



46 DRY FARMING 

divided into three groups for the purposes of our dis- 
cussion, are as follows : — 

Group 1. Group 2. Group 3. 

Carbon Calcium Nitrogen 

Hydrogen Magnesium Phosphorus 

Oxygen Iron Potassium 

Sulphur 
Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen. — Carbon is derived from 
the carbon-dioxide of the air. By means of their 
"breathing pores" the leaves of plants take in this gas 
and in some way combine it with water to make sugars. 
Oxygen is likewise derived from the air, both as carbon- 
dioxide and free oxygen gas, and from water, of which 
it is a constituent part. Hydrogen is derived from 
water. These three elements, carbon, hydrogen and 
oxygen make up from 90 to 95% of mature plants and 
this fact, together with the fact already noted that they 
are derived from the atmosphere and water, has led to 
the error of minimizing the importance of the other seven 
essential elements. 

Calcium, Magnesmm, Iron, Sulphur. — Of the remain- 
ing seven essential elements, four, calcium, magnesium, 
iron and sulphur, though necessary to plants, occur in 
relatively large amounts in the soil in proportion to the 
amounts required by plants. Therefore they do not con- 
cern us, since they are not likely to limit our crop yield. 
The soil is the source of these elements for plants (some 
sulphur comes down with the rain). 

Nitrogen, Phorphorus, Potassium. — The elements of 
this group, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, are, for 
common farm crops, derived from the soil. (Legumes 
can take nitrogen from the air, as will be discussed 
later). Potassium occurs in liberal amounts in most 



THE SOIL 



47 



oils; in some types, particularly muck and peat, it is 
requently lacking and must therefore be supplied if 
aaximum yields are to be obtained. In normal soil, 
Lowever, it is seldom lacking. Nitrogen and phosphorus 
in the other hand are very frequently deficient, and 
hey are, therefore, among the most common world-wide 
oil problems. 

35. The Essential Elements in Saskatchewan Soils. — 
^n the table that follows is given the average content 
[u Saskatchewan 
soils of five es- 
sential elements. 
The figures re- 
ported represent 
the averages of

While such an average analysis of soils does not repre- 
sent the true average for the province and while 16 
samples are not enough upon which to base final judg-; 
ment, the results do have instructive value. It is ap- 
parent that nitrogen and phosphorus, of the essential 
elements, will first limit crop yields. Undoubtedly the 
deficiencies are already felt in the poorer, longer-cropped 
soils. This method of computation is subject to several 
further qualifications however. 

First, the nitrogen supply is subject to additions and 
deductions other than cropping (exclusive also of 
fertilization and green manuring). Certain free-living 
aerobic bacteria (Azotabacter) living in the soil have 
the power of extracting nitrogen from the air ; certain 
amounts of nitrogen are brought down in the rain, 
chiefly as ammonia and nitric acid. On the other hand 
certain bacteria may cause the loss of soil nitrogen into 
the air (denitrification) and what is most important, 
great losses of soil nitrogen occur through surface 
erosion, and through leaching. The latter is relatively 



THE SOIL 



49 



more important in humid regions. But in general even 
under semi-arid conditions the losses from all sources 
other than cropping greatly exceed the gains. Thus 150 
crops of thirty bushels each (4,500 bus.) is by far too 
liberal an estimate from the nitrogen standpoint. 

Second, with phosphorus, and this applies equally to 
nitrogen, even under otherwise ideal conditions, we 
could not' continue to remove 30-bushel crops of wheat 
successively until the phosphorus was exhausted. Under 
humid conditions phosphorus becomes a serious limit- 
ing factor when the supply is below 1,000 pounds. The 
yield is determined by the total supply of plant food, 
and, as will be discussed later, its "availability". In gen- 
eral the yields will become decreasingly smaller as the 
phosphorus or nitrogen (or both) is exhausted.

50 DRY FARMING 

From this table it would appear that our average soil 
compares very favorably with some of the well known 
fertile soils. But again it should be pointed out that this 
"average" soil does not fairly represent the province; 
undoubtedly some of our extensive types, as the sandy 
loams for example, do not measure up to this standard. 
Furthermore, even on the fertile corn belt land, soil 
enrichment has been found both practical and profitable. 

(See table XIV.). 

37. Org-anic Matter and Soil Fertility — Organic matter 
is supplied to the soil in general farm practice in the fol- 
lowing ways : — 

1. Crop residues; 

2. Green manuring; 

3. Pasturing ; 

' 4. Applying farm manure. 

By crop residues are meant the stubble of cereals, 
straws, corn stalks, etc. In the corn belt the corn stalks 
in common practice are broken over, disked and plowed 
under, and the spreading on the land and plowing under 
of straw is not uncommon. While these practices may 
not be possible here, as much organic matter from these 
sources should be returned as is practicable, either by 
feeding and returning as manure or bedding down 
stock, and thus incorporating the straw with the man- 
ure. The burning of straw piles represents not only a 
great waste of organic matter and nitrogen, but of other 
essential elements as well, This is indicated in table VIII.

Thus, if we assume that the fertility elements lost by 
burning the straw could be applied to the production of 
wheat, we find that in each ton the nitrogen would be 
sufficient for 7.1 bushels of wheat, the phosphorus for 
6.7 bushels, and the potassium for 69.2 bushels. These 
losses, together with the loss of other benefits 
of organic matter, are the results of burning the straw. 
"Where straw or manure is spread on the land and then 
burned over only the nitrogen and organic matter are 
lost. Phosphorus, potassium and other mineral elements 
are not destroyed by burning. The ashes are valuable as 
fertilizer if spread evenly over the land. 

Green manuring is the practice of growing crops for 
the express purpose of plowing them under to improve 
the soil. In the older countries legumes are most com- 
monly used, though buckwheat and rye, the latter used 
as a cover crop, are widely used. Since this country will 
never be thickly populated with stock and since the 
depletion of organic matter in the soils is already be- 
coming apparent, green manuring must, of necessity, 
come into common practice, if the organic matter in our 
soils is to be maintained. 

Pasturing, from the standpoint of soil fertility, is the 
most economical method of returning manure to the land. 
The expense of hauling and spreading is saved, and the 
losses by fermentation (fire-fanging) as occur in the 
manure pile in the farmyard, are avoided, 



52

Spreading manure is a time-honored custom, and in 
most communities the benefits are fully appreciated. 
Table IX. brings out the fertility value of manure from 
the standpoint of its content of the essential elements. 
The figures are computed on the basis of average barn- 
yard manure.

Thus one ton of average barnyard manure contains 
as much nitrogen as 7.1 bushels of wheat, as much 
phosphorus as 12.5 bushels, and as much potassium as 
30.8 bushels. If we assume no losses, but that the 
fertility elements contained in a ton of manure go to 
make up grain and straw, the nitrogen would be suf- 
ficient for 5.2 bushels, the phosphorus for 9.4 bushels 
and the potassium for 6.9 bushels. 

In live stock farming the organic matter recovered in 
the manure represents less than one-half of that fed. 
Further loss occurs in the barnyard, due to fermenta- 
tion through the action of bacteria, and through leach- 
ing. In this connection Hopkins' "Soil Fertility and 
Permanent Agriculture" says: "As an average in live- 
stock farming, the animals retain about one-fourth of 
the nitrogen and phosphorus and destroy two-thirds of 
the organic matter of the food consumed, and large loss 
is likely to occur in the manure produced, especially in 
nitrogen and organic matter, a loss in one half of these

culture."

constituents being easily possible during three or four 
months, m part from fermentation, which may occur 
even under cover, and in part from leaching where man- 
ure is exposed to the weather or where little or no 
absorbent bedding is used." 

Concerning manure the North Dakota Experiment 
Station* finds that, "approximately one-half of the 
fertilizing value of manure is lost in rotting, so that it 
probably requires 2 tons of fresh manure to make 1 ton 
of rotted manure. Considering the cost of extra hand- 
ling of rotted manure it would be more profitable to 
haul the manure directly from the barn to the field. It 
can be applied to best advantage to pasture in the 
rotation or plowed under for corn". 

38. Functions of Organic Matter. — Organic matter re- 
turned to the soil functions in several ways : 

1. By improving the physical tilth by increasing the 
humus content as already discussed (i.e. increases the 
water-holding capacity; increases the pore space, hence 
the "warmth" and "earliness" ; renders clays easier to 
work; gives better adhesiveness to sands, etc.). 

2. By supplying the essential elements it contains. 

3. By assisting in dissolving the insoluble plant food 
elements through the action of the acids produced in the 
decay of the organic matter. 

The first two items have already been discussed, the 
third will be taken up under the action of bacteria in the 
soil. 

39. Losses of Organic Matter in the Soil.— That the 
present system of farming which makes no adequate 
provision for the return of organic matter is rapidly de-

soil of the same type on this farm. The yield during 
the last eight years of the experiment has been 28 per 
cent, less than during the first eight years of the 24-year 
period/' 

In Saskatchewan six different soils which had been 
under cultivation for a number of years were compared 
to six virgin soils of the same type which adjoined or 
surrounded the cropped land. This gives six com- 
parisons of cropped and virgin land, showing the effect 
of the present system of farming under actual field con- 
ditions. The analyses reported were made by the De- 
partment of Chemistry of the University of Saskatch-

Humus, the residual material from the decomposition 
of organic matter in the soil, is rapidly dissipated when 
humus- forming materials (organic matter) are not sup- 
plied. Nitrogen in the soil is contained in the organic 
matter and by decomposition of the latter is made avail-

able to plants. Thus the loss of 2,200 pounds of nitrogen, 
the average of the six comparisons, represents the dis- 
sipation of a great amount of organic matter. The 
practice of summerfallowing especially hastens the de- 
composition and dissipation of organic matter, and if 
the practice is a necessary evil, provision must at least 
be made in the future for supplying the humus-forming 
materials. The actual amount of nitrogen removed 
by crops is probably less than one-third of the figure 
given, the other two-thirds, 1,467 lbs, being lost mainly 
through surface washing, soil blowing or drifting, and 
perhaps leaching. 

The phosphorus loss, 567 pounds, is far greater than 
could be explained by removal in crops. Phosphorus 
being contained principally in insoluble form in the 
soil, is not lost by leaching. Surface-washing and per- 
haps soil-blowing or "drifting" are largely responsible 
for the losses not accounted for in the crops. 

The figures in table XII. are not to be taken at their 
absolute value, however. We cannot be certain that a 
sample of soil from cropped land had at one time the 
same composition as a sample of virgin land adjoining. 
However, when repeated comparisons show the same re- 
sult, we have a good "indication" of the results of our 
farm practices. That a tremendous loss in organic 
matter does occur is a matter of common observation, 
and the bad effects are plainly evident in working the 
land, 

40. The Rothamsted Experiments on Soil-Fertility. — 
The best information on the value of soil treatment as 
opposed to no treatment in good systems of crop rotation 
is from the Rothamsted Experiment Station near Lon- 
don, England. Two rotations are compared as follows:

The first is termed the legume rotation, the second the 
fallow rotation. Both rotations are arranged so that 
complete fertilization can be compared to no treatment. 
The complete fertilization consists of the addition of 
essential plant food elements in the form of common 
commercial fertilizers. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potas- 
sium, magnesium, sodium and sulphur are included, in 
the form of ammonium sulphate, acid phosphate, potas- 
sium chloride, etc. The fertilizers are applied once in 
four years (for the turnip crop). The experiment has 
been carried on for sixty years, the results appearing in 
table XIII.

This is perhaps the world's best evidence on the food 
requirements of plants. On the unfertilized fields the 
crop yields steadily decreased. On the fertilized fields 
the yields have been maintained at a high average, the

was capable of at the beginning. The rotations alone, 
therefore, would not maintain yields without fertiliza- 
tion. Plants as well as animals require food. 

41. Illinois Experiment. — The Illinois Agricultural Ex- 
periment Station is conducting an experiment on the 
typical brown silt loam prairie land of the Corn Belt. 
Five fields are under cultivation, "wheat, corn, oats and 
clover being rotated for five years on four fields, while 
alfalfa occupies the fifth field, which is then brought 
under the four-crop system to make place for alfalfa 
on one of the other fields for another five-year period, 
and so on*". Sixteen years' results have been publishedf, 
the averages appearing in table XIV.

systems of f^trming, — grain farming and live-stock farm- 
ing. Hopkins* explains this method as follows : 

"Under the 
live stock sys- 
tem of manage- 
ment the nitro- 
gen and organic 
matter of the 
soil are main- 
tained by apply- 
ing as much 
manure as can 
be made from 
the produce 
grown upon the 
land. On this 
basis no more 
manure is ap- 
plied to a plot 
than can be 
made from the 
produce of that 
plot. For every 

ton of produce grown, an equivalent amount of average 
farm manure is returned during the rotation. Under a 
good system of live stock farming it has been found that 
about one ton of average manure can be made from one 
ton of feed and bedding. A large amount of the grain 
produced is fed, in the live stock system, the legumes har- 
vested as hay, and the hay, straw and stover used for 
feeding and bedding purposes."

may be used as a top-dressing for the protection of winter 
•crops and eventually turned under." 

The methods of soil enrichment illustrated by this ex- 
periment have come into common practice in Illinois and 
several of the adjoining states. Thus nitrogen and 



62 DRY FARMING 

organic matter are supplied by manure and crop resi- 
dues (including legumes used as green manure, etc.). 
Commercial nitrogen, such as sodium nitrate, does 
not pay under extensive systems of farming. When the 
land is acid (sour) ground natural limestone, made from 
crushing limestone found in natural deposits, is most 
effectual and economical. To supply phosphorus, finely 
ground, natural raw rock phosphate is applied, being 
the cheapest form, and, under humid conditions when 
applied with actively decaying organic matter, being as 
effective as the more readily available but more expensive 
acid phosphate. 

The practices of the more humid Corn Belt will not 
apply in full to Western Canadian conditions. Under 
semi-arid conditions, our soils cannot handle the amounts 
of crop residues or manure that are turned under in the 
humid regions. However, with the depletion of organic 
matter and nitrogen our system must be changed. Mixed 
farming is undoubtedly becoming more general and the 
manure should be carefully conserved. But this will 
never entirely supply the soil needs for organic matter 
and nitrogen. The use of leguminous crops in the rota- 
tion will be a big step in advance. 

It is interesting to note in the Illinois Experiment 
that where the needs of the soil are fully 'provided for 
(plots 6 and 7) the grain system is equal, if not slightly 
superior, to the live stock system of farming. Thus, it 
is possible in the Corn Belt to farm entirely without 
live stock. The Canadian prairies may always be de- 
voted chiefly to grain farming, and if our agriculture is 
to be permanent and profitable, we must plan our sys- 
tems for conditions as they actually exist. Only by long- 
continued, carefully conducted experiments such as the 



THE SOIL 



63 



Rothamsted and Illinois experiments can our problems 
be solved. 

42. Soil Acidity and Liming the Land. — Soil acidity 
(sourness in soil) is a common problem in the humid 
climates, especially in the older agricultural regions such 
as England, the continent of Europe, and eastern 
United States. Where soils are acid, finely ground 
natural limestone rock has been found to be the cheapest 
and most effective. It is applied at the rate of one to two 
tons per acre, depending upon the degree of acidity in 
the soil. The 
soils of the arid 
and semi-arid 
regions are more 
likely to be alka- 
line than acid 
(alkaline is the 
opposite of 
acid) due to the 
fact that alka- 
line salts and 
limestone are 
not leached 
away as in 
humid sections. 
Limestone i s 
present in sufficient quantity in most Western Canadian 
soils, so that this question need give us no concern. 

43. Crop notations and Soil Fertility. — From Table 
■XIII. we see that barley grown at Rothamsted, England,

legume system and 25.2 bushels in the fallow system. Ir 
this same rotation wheat produced 25.0 and 27.1 busheh 
respectively. 

In another field (Broadbalk Field) wheat has been 
grown continuously for 55 years unfertilized, the aver- 
age yield being 12.9 bushels. In still another field (Hoos 
Field), barley has been grown continuously for 55 years, 
unfertilized, the average yield beeing 14.8 bushels. This 
is positive proof of the benefit of crop rotation over a 
one-crop system. It was pointed out, however, from 
table XIII., that crop rotation without fertilization 
would not maintain the crop yields. The matter of crop 
rotations is discussed fully elsewhere and it is intended 
here only to emphasize the fact that whereas a rotation 
is much superior to a one-crop system, provision should 
be made in the rotation for the return of organic mat- 
ter and nitrogen and the mineral plant-food elements, 
especially phosphorus, if deficient. Crop rotation with 
no return of plant food is only a more efficient way of 
robbing the soil; it makes possible greater crops, which 
means the withdrawal of greater amounts of plant food 
and therefore more rapid depletion of the soil's fertility. 

The Soil a Living Mass. 

44. Importance of Microorganisms in the Soil. — We 

have seen that animals are dependent upon the higher 
plants. In turn the higher plants are dependent upon 
microorganisms. If the action of the latter were stop- 
ped for any considerable length of time, life would be- 
come impossible upon the earth; our very existence de- 
pends upon them. 

The question might well be asked : What would be 
the condition of the earth, if, through the many ages, the 



THE SOIL 65 

dead bodies of animals and plants had simply remained 
upon the surface of the earth and had not decayed into 
an unrecognizable, powc^ery mass in the soil ? The layer 
of trash would soon become so deep that seedlings upon 
the ground would find it impossible to push their way 
up into the sunlight ; there would be no room for animal 
life; the earth would become uninhabitable. The lower 
organisms perform a great service in reducing the re- 
mains of plant and animal life to the black residue in the 
soil which we call 'Tiumus". The humus represents but 
a small portion of the great bulk, the greater part being 
released into the air in the form of gases and water 
vapor, through the action of our infinitely small friends. 
But this does not tell the whole story. We have shown 
that plants require food as well as animals, and that this 
food is derived from the soil, air and water. The ma- 
terials from these sources would have long since be 
come exhausted if it were not possible to use them over 
and over again. Thus we speak of the "cycles" of the 
plant-food elements, and in these the lower organisms 
play the leading part. In the decay of plant and animal 
matter, carbon dioxide gas is given off, and this carbon- 
dioxide can again be used by living plants as before ex- 
plained. In a similar manner nitrogen may be used 
over and over again, and likewise phosphorus, though 
instead of a gas these substances are converted into 
nitrates and phosphates, in which form they become 
available to plants. The cycle is not always so simple. 
It is the business of the microorganisms to prepare the 
. food for the higher plants, and the plants and animals 
in turn furnish the food and energy through which 
microorganisms can do their work. The one depends 
upon the other. 



66 DRY FARMING 

People have become accustomed to thinking of the 
bacteria and fungi wholly as enemies; we think onlj'^ of 
the ravages of disease. The science of bacteriology has 
* developed more along this line. In our farm practices 
i.e. plowing, cultivation, manuring, etc., we give little 
heed to the consideration of the effects of these opera- 
tions on the bacterial activities of the soil. It is fortun- 
ate indeed that the practices which favor the production 
of crops from the plant standpoint are also favorable to 
the activity of the beneficial bacteria. 

45. The Soil a living Mass. — The soil is inhabited by 
five kinds of microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, algae, 
yeasts and protozoa. The first four are vegetable or 
plant forms of life, the last, protozoa, are miscroscopic 
animals. Of the five groups the bacteria and fungi are 
most important. It is with the bacteria that we are 
mainly concerned, though the fungi take part in many of 
the useful activities in the soil. 

The numbers of the bacteria in soils vary with the 
type of soil, season of the year, moisture present, etc. 
The number may vary from several million per gram in 
a thin, poor soil, to a thousand million per gram in sew- 
age farmed land. If, on ordinary soil, we assume a con- 
tent of 60,000,000 per gram, 27,216,000,000 per pound of 
soil, not at all an unreasonable or unusual number, we 
find that the surface 6 2/3 inches of soil over an acre 
(2,000,000 pounds) would contain a live weight of 
bacteria equal to 250 pounds. This would represent a 
volume of about 3.8 cubic feet. These figures bring out 
the very great numbers of the bacteria and their ex- 
tremely small size. Due to the very great numbers ever 
present, the soil has frequently been spoken of as a 
'living mass". 



THE SOIL 67 

In general, light sandy soils have fewer numbers than 
the heavier, richer, types. The amount of food (organic 
matter) has an important bearing on the number of 
bacteria. Also virgin soils have lower counts than 
cultivated soils, due in part at least to the fact that 
cultivation, especially deep plowing, increases the depth 
of their operations by giving better access to air 
(oxygen). The greatest numbers occur between the 
fourth and sixth inch levels in average soils. This, of 
course, varies greatly. Soils may be sterile at three feet 
if impervious in nature, and are not infrequently sterile 
at a depth of eight or ten feet. As would be expected 
the highest numbers are found in the spring and fall. 
Owing to the heat and lack of moisture, the numbers are 
reduced in midsummer. In winter many of the 
vegetative forms are killed and great numbers go into a 
spore or resting stage to await more favorable condi- 
tions. 

46. Functions of the Bacteria in the Soil. — The func- 
tions of the bacteria in the soil may be classed under four 
heads : 

1. Destruction or decay of dead matter. 

2. Preparation of available plant food for plants. 

3. Parasitism (disease). 

4. Symbiosis. 

The activity of the bacteria in bringing about the de- 
cay of plant and animal remains has already been al- 
luded to. In farm practice this accounts for the decay 
and incorporation with the soil of the stubble, straws, 
corn stalks, manure, etc., that are plowed under. These 
substances under the action of the bacteria are decom- 
posed, part becoming dissipated into the air as gases 



68 DRY FARMING 

and water vapor, the residue, humus, becoming a part 
of the soil mass. 

47. Preparation of Available Plant-food.— The grow- 
ing plant has need of an ever-present supply of plant 
food that is soluble and may be taken up readily by the 
roots. The bacteria are always at work preparing this 
food, and should their activity be stopped for any con- 
siderable period of time, the plant would suffer and die 
of starvation. Though concerned in the liberation of 
all plant-food elements, the relations of the bacteria to 
nitrogen are especially important. 

48. The Nitrogen Cycle. — Farm crops depend upon 
the soil for their nitrogen, and this nitrogen must be in 
the form of nitrates to be utilized by plants. (Legumes 
are an exception and when inoculated, they may draw 
upon the nitrogen gas of the air). Chile salt-peter 
(sodium nitrate), a common fertilizer, represents such 
a form which is available to plants. The nitrate is ab- 
sorbed by the roots and is built up into protein in the 
plant. The latter may be eaten by an animal, the pro- 
tein then becoming a part of the animal body or may be 
voided in the manure. The original bit of nitrate may, 
therefore, exist in altered form as a part of the prairie 
sod, of the wheat stubble, or of the animal flesh or man- 
ure. If returned to the soil and plowed under, before it 
can again be used by plants, it must go through a pre- 
paratory process. First tlie plant or animal remains 
must undergo decay or decomposition, the nitrogen be- 
ing converted into ammonia. A great many kinds of 
bacteria in the soil may take part in this process, the 
end product in every case being ammonia. Certain 
bacteria in the soil (the nitrous acid bacteria) seize upon 
this ammonia and convert it into nitrite, a nitrogen com-

pound containing oxygen. Another species of bacteria 
(the nitric acid bacteria) then converts this nitrite into 
nitrate, through the further addition of oxygen to the 
nitrogen. As nitrate,, the nitrogen may then be used 
again by plants. 

Certain losses of nitrogen through bacterial action are 
likely to occur, especially in the manure pile. "Firing" 
or "fire-fanging", due to the rapid decomposition of the 
manure, results in the escape of nitrogen to the air in 
gaseous form. The process is called denitrification and 
is due to bacterial action. A similar process occurs in 
soils, especially when water-logged, but the losses from 
this source in well-tilled soils are not appreciable. 

On the other hand, additions to the soil's supply of 
nitrogen may occur in several ways. Small amounts are 
brought down from the atmosphere by the rain and 
snow, chiefly as ammonia and nitric acid. In the soil 
certain bacteria (Azotobacter) living upon the carbon- 
aceous material in the soil, have the ability to extract 
free nitrogen gas from the air and build it up into their 
bodies. These sources, however, are not of great 
magnitude. A third source, the fixation of nitrogen by 
leguminous plants, will receive due consideration. 

49. The Mineral Plant Food Elements. — In the decay 
of organic matter, carbonic acid and many other organic 
acids are formed. In the nitrification process nitrous 
and nitric acid are formed, not as free acids but united 
with the basic substances, among them the essential 
plant food elements as calcium, magnesium and potas- 
sium. These substances, occurring in the soil in in- 
soluble compounds, are rendered soluble by this process. 
Phosphorus occurring chiefly in the soil as the insoluble 
tricalcium phosphate becomes soluble and available to 



THE SOIL 71 

plants through the solvent action of the organic acids. 
By the nitrification process it is converted from the 
insoluble form to the soluble acid phosphate in which 
form it may be used by plants. 

These principles find application in practical agri- 
culture. The results of the Ohio and Illinois stations 
have shown that the crushed raw rock phosphate ap- 
plied with liberal amounts of farm manure (or crop 
residues) gives yields that are equal to the acid phos- 
phate, and at considerably less expense. The failures to 
secure results upon soils deficient in phosphorus by 
the use of raw rock phosphate have been due to the fail- 
ure to provide decaying organic matter. Nature has 
wisely locked up the phosphorus in the soil in insoluble 
form so that it wiU not be wasted, but has beneficently 
provided a means whereby it may become available to 
plants. The '^hy'^ in agricultural practice is as im- 
portant as the *Tiow" ; it is the safest guide to a perman- 
ent and profitable system. 

50. Parasitism (disease). — That the soil harbors many 
disease-producing microorganisms is now a matter of 
common knowledge. Among the bacterial plant dis- 
eases crown gall, pear blight, black leg and soft rot of 
potatoes, are typical examples, and among the fungous 
diseases flax wilt, wheat rust, and the smuts. These 
organisms, however, are not related to the fertility of 
the soil. 

51. Nitrogen-fixation by Leguminous Plants. — Three- 
fourths of the atmosphere by weight is nitrogen gas ; over 
one acre of land there are 70 million pounds of nitrogen, 
enough for nearly a million bushels of wheat if it were 
available to that crop. But wheat cannot utilize di- 
rectly the free nitrogen gas of the air. 



72 



DRY FARMING 



Certain plants, the legumes, have the ability when 
inoculated to draw upon the air for nitrogen. Red 
clover, sweet clover, alfalfa, peas, beans, and vetch are 
examples of leguminous plants. These plants do not have 
the power in themselves to take up free nitrogen gas. 
It is through certain bacteria, the nodule bacteris, which 
live in the soil that this is made possible. These bacteria 




Fig. 25. — Nodules on the Roots of Alfalfa. 

These nodules are the homes of millions of alfalfa bacteria which gather 

Srogen frS.! the air and turn it over to the plant.-Courtesy Wisconsin 

Agricultural Experiment Station. 

attack the root-hairs of the legume plant, causing the 
formation of gall-like structures called nodules upon 
the roots. In these nodules the bacteria live and mul- 
tiply, extracting from the plants the sugars and 



THE SOIL 73 

other materials necessary for their life processes. In 
return they absorb the nitrogen gas from the air, which 
circulates through the soil, and turn it over to the plant 
in a form that the plant can utilize. Without the pres- 
ence of bacteria and without the presence of the nodules 
this process would not go on. The legume plants would 
behave like ordinary crops, using only the nitrate- 
nitrogen found in the soil. 

This process is termed symbiosis, which means that 
the two organisms, the bacteria and the plant, live to- 
gether to their mutual benefit. Thus the bacteria are 
provided with a home (the nodule) and food (sugar), 
and in turn they supply the plant with an inexhaustible 
nitrogen supply. Neither is injured by the union, but 
on the other hand both are greatly benefited. 

If legumes are grown in soil which contains no nitro- 
gen but are inoculated and given all the essentials for 
growth except nitrogen, the plants will live and thrive 
noi'mally, extracting in this case, through the aid of the 
bacteria, their entire nitrogen supply from the air. If, 
on the other hand, the soil contains nitrogen, it will draw 
in part upon this and in part from the air. According- 
ly as the soil is richer in nitrogen, especially as' nitrate, 
the plants will draw more heavily upon the soil and less 
upon the air for their nitrogen. Hopkins has figured 
that upon normal soil of average fertility, red clover 
when inoculated secures about 2/3 of its nitrogen from 
the air and 1/3 from the soil. When cut for hay the 
part removed contains 2/3 of the nitrogen present in the 
entire plant, the roots and stubble containing 1/3. Thus 
when the hay is removed, as much nitrogen is removed 
as was obtained from the air. The stubble and roots 
turned under do not produce any gain for the soil, the

same amount being turned under as came originalh^ 
from the soil. This, however, is a great advantage over 
other hay crops where every pound of nitrogen removed 
represents a loss to the soil. But every ton of clover 
tops contains forty pounds of nitrogen, so that every

ton of clover turned under fof the purpose of soil en- 
richment represents a gain to the soil of forty pounds of 
nitrogen. 

Sweet clover tops contain on the average 40 to 50 
pounds of nitrogen per ton, so that every ton of sweet 
clover tops turned under for soil enrichment is worth 



THE SOIL 75 

four to five tons of manure from the standpoint of 
nitrogen (manure contains 10 lbs. of nitrogen per ton). 
This together with the tonnage that it produces, ex- 
plains why sweet clover is becoming so widely grown for 
improving the soil in the humid sections. The suc- 
culence of the plant renders it easily and quickly decom- 
posed by the bacteria, making possible the turning 
under of very great amounts. This then furnishes a 
large amount of organic matter, and the nitrogen 
through bacterial action becomes available to succeed- 
ing crops. The result is that the corn or wheat crops 
following are frequently doubled, and the effect is not 
limited to the one year following, but is apparent for 
several years through increased yields. Such practice 
must come into vogue in the Prairie Provinces when the 
organic matter and nitrogen supply need replenishing. 

It should again be emphasized that in order to secure 
nitrogen from the air the legumes must he inoculated. 
The bacteria may already be present in some soils and 
if so they will make their presence known by forming 
nodules on the roots of the young plants. If the nodules 
are not formed, it is positive proof that the bacteria are 
not present, and upon such soils artificial inoculation, 
either applied as a culture to the seed or applied by 
spreading and disking in some well-infected soil from 
a field known to be inoculated must be resorted to. 

In applying inoculation to the seed different kinds of 
nodule bacteria must be used for certain legumes. Al- 
falfa and sweet clover require one kind, peas and vetch 
take another, while the true clovers, red clover, mam- 
moth clover, white clover, alsike clover, require still 
another. The bacteria which produce nodules on the 
roots of alfalfa and sweet clover will not produce 



76 DRY FARMING 

nodules on the roots of peas, vetch or the true clovers. 
The groups are absolutely distinct. 

The Factors of Soil Fertility. 

52. The Measure of Fertility. — The measure of the 
fertility of the soil is the crop it produces or can be made 
to produce. This is not the result of any one factor, but 
of a combination of factors. 

The physical make-up of the soil determines in part at 
least the extensiveness and effectiveness of the root- 
system of the plant. It is concerned with the ability of 
the soil to absorb and retain moisture. It affects the 
tilth, the air supply and the warmth of the soil. 

The chemical composition of the soil determines its 
potential possibilities. Since we know the kinds and 
amounts of plant-food elements that our crops require, 
and since chemical analyses will tell us the total amounts 
present in any particular soil, we have an index to the 
fertility of that soil. "We have a means of discovering the 
deficiencies, and when confirmed by actual field tests, 
this is the safest guide to good practice. 

The bacteria are concerned with the liberation (mak- 
ing available) of plant food. This is brought about 
through the organic matter supplied. The value of 
organic matter is therefore apparent. It furnishes the 
food and energy for the bacteria which when thus sup- 
plied make plant food available (soluble) for the plant. 
In addition the actively decaying organic matter is the 
source of humus in the soil. 

Permanency in agriculture depends upon the control 
by man, in so far as is possible, of the factors essential 
to the production of crops. The stock of materials in the 



THE SOIL 77 

soil when diminished to the point that crop yields are 
limited, must be replenished. By making provision for 
the return of organic matter we provide for the needs 
of the plant for available plant food. It should be the 
business of every progressive farmer to give as much 
thought to the soil he is working as he does to his farm 
machinery or animals. Just as his farm animals and 
machinery fail to give good returns from bad treatment, 
so the soil will likewise fail to produce profitably under 
irrational treatment. 



CHAPTER IV. 
THE MOISTURE PROBLEM 

Water is required in large amounts by growing plants 
and the source of all moisture for crops, except under 
irrigation, is the clouds. The average precipitation is 
a general guide to the amount that is likely to fall in any 
year. Areas having more than 30 inches precipitation 
are spoken of as humid ; those having between 20 and 30, 
sub-humid; between 10 and 20 inches, semi-arid; while 
those having less than 10 are called arid. Most of West- 
ern Canada is semi-arid; our average precipitation is 
low and the water requirements of growing crops is 
high; the chief cause of low yields is lack of moisture. 

The moisture problem briefly stated consists of (1) 
storing as much moisture as possible in the soil, (2) 
conserving it as well as we can, (3) keeping it available 
to the seed and plant roots, and (4) making the most 
efficient use of it. 

53. Storing Moisture in the Soil.— When moisture falls 
upon the land in the form of rain it is either absorbed 
by the soil or it finds its way to ditches, ravines or 
sloughs. The problem of storing moisture is one of pre- 
venting the "run off'' which occurs chiefly at two sea- 
sons, one during the heavy midsummer rains and the 
other when the snow melts in the spring. The amount 

78 



THE MOISTURE PROBLEM 79 

of "run off" is largely determined by (1) the topography 
of the land, and (2) the openness or receptivity of the 
soil. 

The topography cannot be altered but some loss of 
water may be prevented by tilling crosswise of the main 
slopes. The more open the soil is at the time of the 
heavy rains or when the snow is melting the more 



Fig. 27. — Wheat Under Irrigation near Strathmore, Alberta. 

moisture it will take in and the less "run-off" there will 
be. 

The storage of moisture in "old" land is accom- 
plished by : 

1. (a) Fallowing the land once in two, three, four or 

five years, depending upon the average pre- 
cipitation and evaporation, 
(b) Plowing or otherwise cultivating the fallow 
early to lessen the possible "run-off" after 
heavy rains. 

2. Using such intertilled crops as may not require all 
the water, thus permitting of the storage of some; 

3. Using crops that may be harvested early, thus per- 



80 DRY FARMING 

mitting the land to lie fallow and accumulate 
moisture for a longer time in the fall ; 

4. Increasing the organic matter content of light soil 
types so as to increase their moisture-holding power 
and decrease the loss of moisture by percolation. 

The storage of moisture in new or prairie land or sod 
land is accomplished by 

1. Breaking and leaving idle for a year (less in some 
areas) in order to make the land receptive for the 
summer rains ; 

2. Breaking early in order that the loss of moisture 
through the growth of native vegetation may be 
prevented ; 

The storage of moisture in stulUe land is accom- 
plished by 

1. Leaving a long stubble to hold snow which on melt- 
ing adds water to the soil; or 

2. Cultivating with discs or even by shallow plowing 
early in the fall so that the soil may be put in a 
condition to absorb more of the water from melting 
snows. (Note that (1) and (2) are not possible on 
the same area). 

54. Conserving Moisture in the Soil.— Moisture that has 
been stored in the soil may be lost in one or more of only 
three ways: 

(1) by seepage or drainage through the soil, 

(2) by evaporation from the surface into the atmos- 
phere, 

(3) by passing out through the stems and leaves of 
growing plants in the natural processes of growth. 

The loss through seepage or drainage is very little 
in dry climates except on light or coarse grained soils 
or soils having a subsoil that is sandy or gravelly. On 



THE MOISTURE PROBLEM 81 

such soils the lessening of seepage can only be brought 
about by increasing the organic matter content a 
practice which is seldom profitable except on the better 
grades of these types of soil. The dry farmer should 
avoid soils that are so light and loose that loss by seep- 
age is probable. 

The loss of moisture by evaporation from the soil 
into the atmosphere is very great. No data giving the 
actual amount of loss from a soil surface in this climate 
are available, but when it is realized that from 60 to 100 
inches of water evaporates from a water surface in a 
year in the southern portion of the Great Plains, the 
extent of the evaporation from a soil surface may be 
imagined. The very great loss by evaporation may be 
lessened ( 1 ) by the use of a mulch on the surface of the 
land, and (2) by increasing the moisture-holding power 
of the soil by maintaining or increasing its supply of 
humus or partially decomposed organic matter. While 
it is a fact that a soil mulch lessens the amount of water 
that leaves the soil by evaporation in humid climates, 
there is some question as to its effectiveness in dry clim- 
ates and also as to how much expense a farmer is justified 
in assuming in order to make a relatively small 
saving. (See "The Application of the Capillary Theory 
to Dry Farming Practices" in Chapter XVI.) 

The loss of moisture through its use by growing plants 
is very great. As little as 250 pounds of water and as 
much as 1,000 pounds have been found to be taken into 
the roots of plants and transpired into the atmosphere 
through the leaves in the process of taking in food ma- 
terials sufficient to make one pound of dry matter. So 
long as the plants using it are useful to man this largfc 
amount of water is not a loss, even though it may hav» 



82 



DRY FARMING 



disappeared from the soil. But when useless plants or 
weeds use up the moisture it is a serious economic waste. 
Recent investigations in soil moisture conservation 
emphasize the belief that under normal soil conditions 
Weeds are not the secondary but the chief means by 
which moisture is lost from the soil. They also indicate 
that tillage for moisture conservation should have as its 
practical aim (1) the control of weed growth, and (2) 
the prevention of soil cracking or soil baking, or the

drying out of the furrow slice. If these aims are fully 
attained it seems probable that any extra tillage will 
not result in a sufficiently increased return to pay for 
the extra work. 

The practices by which the moisture stored in the 
fallotv can be conserved are : 

1, Early harrowing or packing after plowing in order 
to lessen excessive evaporation from the furrow 
slice. 



THE MOISTURE PROBLEM 83 

2. Sufficient surface cultivation to kill weeds, grass 
and volunteer grains, which use up water in the 
process of growth. 

3. Sufficient surface cultivation to prevent the soil 
from cracking, and thereby increasing the evaporat- 
ing surface. 

The conservation of mioisture "stored" in breaking is 
accomplished by : 

1. Packing or "planking" immediately after breaking 
— so as to lessen the loss of moisture from the fur- 
row slice and the subsoil by the drying winds. 

2. Disking and harrowing as necessary to control 
weeds and grass. 

The conservation of the limited moisture supply in 
stubble land can be effected by : 

1. Fall plowing of grassy land to kill the grass and 
thus save the water the grass demands for growth, — 
a practice which may be neutralized in the very 
dry parts by increased evaporation from the over- 
turned furrow slice. 

2. Early harrowing or packing of all spring-plowed 
land in order to protect the furrow slice and sub- 
soil from the drjdng effect of the winds. 

3. Harrowing early in the spring before sowing, or 
harrowing such crops as cereals, corn and potatoes 
after they are up in order to control weed growth 
or prevent the soil cracking. This practice cannot 
be followed indiscriminately on all soils, as on some 
it will result in increasing the danger of soil drift- 
ing. 

55. Keeping Soil Moisture Available. — Making the best 
possible use of the moisture stored and conserved in the 



84 DRY FARMING 

soil is not the least important of the problems of the dry 
farmer. It may be considered under two heads : — 

1. How to keep a supply of it continuously available 
to the seeds in the soil or to plant roots, and 

2, How to make it serve its purpose most efficiently. 
Of the three forms in which moisture occurs in the 

soil, viz., free water, capillary water and hygroscopic 
water, only that in the capillary form is of immediate 
value to growing plants. The small portion known as 
hygroscopic moisture, which is present about th(; soil 
particles when they are air dry is held so firmly that 
plants cannot extract it. The free water, that portion 
found filling the spaces between the particles of a soil 
which is flooded, is of very great value as a source of 
supply even though it cannot be drawn upon directly 
and is sometimes harmful to plants. Free water when 
present in the subsoil may be changed to capillary or 
film water, in which form it may move up or down or 
in any other direction or be held by the soil even against 
gravity. It is in the capillary form only that water may 
_be drawn upon by plants. 

In the practice of crop growing it frequently hap- 
pens that something is done which either lessens the 
chance of the plant getting at the moisture in the soil or 
what is of equally serious concern, makes it difficult or 
impossible for the moisture in the subsoil to move to 
where the seeds or plant roots are. Thus when coarse 
manure or long stubble are plowed under in fall or 
spring in preparing for a crop the next season, loose 
open spaces are created between the seed bed and the 
subsoil and the availability of even the capillary moist- 
ure is interfered with. Similarly when coarse clods are 
plowed under, or the plowing left in rolls, or the fur-

row left on its edge, or the land plowed when it is too 
dry, or allowed to bake after being plowed when too wet, 
open air spaces 
are created be- 
low the furrow 
slice which ser- 
iously lessens 
not only the 
moisture move- 
ment from the 
subsoil to the 
seed or to plant 
roots but also 
the ability of 
the roots to 
reach out after 
moisture. Mois- 
ture cannot rise 
through large, 
loose, open 
spaces in the 
bottom of the 
furrow slice, nor 
can plant roots 
grow down 
through them 
sat isfactorily. 
Obviously, these 
practices, unless 
modified, are un- 
suited to dry 
farm conditions.

conserved in the soil is kept available, or at least not 

rendered unavailable, are: 

(1) By not plowing under thick layers of dense grass 
or other rubbish, unless time sufficient for its de- 
cay is allowed before seeding the next crop. 

• (2) By not plowing under a heavy stubble in fall or 
spring unless the land is to be thoroughly com- 
pacted so that the moisture in the subsoil may 
rise into the furrow slice to meet the needs of the 
crop. 

(3) By seeing that in all fall or spring plowing the 
overturned furrow is brought firmly in contact 
with the subsoil, so that there may be the least 
possible interference with the free movement of 
moisture upwards from the subsoil. 

(4) When applying manure, to put it on thinly and 
firm the soil about it before crops are sown, so 
that it will quickly decay and not interfere with 
the movement of soil moisture. Coarse, strawy 
manure and stubble are often worse than useless 
until they have decayed, after which time they 
exert a very beneficial effect on the moisture-ab- 
sorbing and moisture-holding capacity of the soil. 

(5) By leaving the soil in such condition that the 
seed can get the necessary moisture for germina- 
tion without having to be sown too deeply. 

(6) By preventing the formation of a "hard-pan" 
below the furrow or by remedying it if it is al- 
ready there. 

56 The Efficient Utilization of Soil Moisture.— The soil 
moisture will be utilized most efficiently if three things 
are done: (1) the supply of available plant food kept 
up, (2) drought-resistant crops grown, and (3) suit-

able crop management practices followed. The first of 
these is discussed in the next section and the other two 
in the chapter that follow^s. 

57. Soil Fertility and Soil Moisture.— One of the chief 
functions of the water stored in the soil is to dissolve 
plant food substances and carry them through the root

hairs into the plant. The more of such material a unit 
of water can carry into the plant the more bushels per 
acre the limited supply of water may produce. It has 
been found that when equal amounts of water are sup- 
plied to rich and poor soils the former produces the 
larger yield. Widtsoe* states (1) that on a naturally 
fertile Utah soil 908 pounds of water were required to 
produce each pound of dry matter in corn, (2) that

88 DRY FARMING 

when this soil was manured only 613 pounds were re- 
quired, and (3) that when commercial fertilizers were 
applied only 585 pounds of water were necessary to pro- 
duce a pound of dry matter. Similarly he found that 
*'on sandy loam, not cultivated, 603 pounds of water 
were transpired to produce one pound of dry matter in 
corn ; on the same soil, cultivated, only 252 pounds were 
required. On a clay loam, not cultivated, 535 pounds 
of water were transpired for each pound of dry matter, 
whereas on the cultivated soil only 428 pounds were 
necessary. On a clay soil, not cultivated, 753 pounds of 
water were transpired for each pound of dry matter; 
on cultivated soil, only 582 pounds/^ 

While our soils are new and rich an average rainfall 
will generally produce a fair yield. As soon as they be- 
come less "fertile" the same amount of rain is likely to 
produce a smaller crop. The results of theses investi- 
gations clearly show that the more fertile a soil is, the 
greater yield it will produce from a given supply of 
moisture. This is one reason why dry farmers should 
strive to maintain the "fertility" of their soils.

DRY FARM CROPPING PRACTICES 91 

grown. What we are about to say in this chapter should 
not be interpreted as suggesting that radical changes 
should be made in the crops now used in those portions 
of the West that enjoy a rainfall of sixteen inches or 
more, or that are outside the prairie area. The sug- 
gestions that follow are meant rather as a guide to those 
men in the dry belt who have found that the commonly 
grown crops have not given satisfactory returns. 

58. Drought Resistant Crops. — The dry farmer should 
keep in mind that some plants are better able to with- 
stand drought than others. The factors that constitute 
drought resistance are not all well understood but sev- 
eral are now quite well appreciated by dry farming in- 
vestigators. For instance, it is now well known (1) that 
different crops require different amounts of moisture to 
produce a unit of dry matter, (2) that certain types of 
crops are able to withstand more drought than others, 
(3) that the growth of some classes of crops so parallels 
the monthly distribution of rainfall that they produce 
larger yields than others, the growth habits of which are 
different — in other words they avoid drought — and (4) 
that crops which permit of intertillage may develop bet- 
ter under similar precipitation than those not adapted 
to this method of culture. 

Recent investigations have shown that among our 
commonly grown crops millet, sorghum and corn re- 
quire the least moisture per unit of dry matter produced ; 
that the legume crops, like alfalfa, peas and clovers re- 
quire the most — and that the grain crops — wheat, oats, 
barley and rye and flax — are intermediate in moisture 
requirements. 



92 DRY FARMING 

Carefully conducted experiments have also shown 
that some crops will withstand drought better than 
others. For instance, brome grass and Western rye 
grass for some reason withstand more drought than any 
of the other commonly used grasses. Alfalfa will with-

the drier areas. 

stand more drought than clovers, Durum wheat more 
than common wheat, and Emmer more than oats or 
barley. 

It is well appreciated by western farmers that annual 
crops yield much more than perennial ones, and that 
those crops which can be sown early and that reach 
their greatest growth during the late stages of the rainy 
season, and that ripen before the dry autumn months 
are the most satisfactory to grow. This is why oats, an 
annual crop, is more generally used as hay than the 
grasses which are perennial. It explains why sweet 
clover yields more on dry land than alfalfa and it is the 



DRY FARM CROPPING PRACTICES 93 

reason the grain crops are the ones best suited to our 
climate. 

The value of intertilled crops, particularly those that 
are harvested early, as a preparation for grain crops, 
has long been appreciated by farmers in dry climates. 
Very large yields after corn and fair returns after po- 
tatoes are of common occurrence. The difficulty has 
been to grow these or similar crops profitably in a large 
way at the present time. The economic conditions now 
existing favor extensive rather than intensive methods 
for the average farmer in the West, although as land 
becomes higher in price and labor and equipment 
relatively cheaper, more intensive methods will probably 
pay better than extensive ones. 

The drought resistant or drought avoiding crops that 
are little grown but that promise much for the dry farm- 
ing districts of "Western Canada and that warrant very 
careful trial are :

resistant. It is, however, a macaroni wheat and has not 
as yet been grown to any extent as the market demand 
has been for the common wheats. It has done exception- 
ally well in western North and South Dakota and eastern 
Montana and has averaged slightly more per acre than 
the common spring wheat at Saskatoon. The price is 
generally slightly lower than for hard red spring. This 
wheat is deserving of careful trial. Kubanka is at pres- 
ent the best variety of this class of wheat. 



DRY FARM CROPPING PRACTICES 95 

60. Winter Rye. — This is a promising crop for grain, 
hay and pasture. The relatively low price of rye grain 
prevents it competing successfully with wheat where the 
latter can be grown satisfactorily. On some types of 
soil and in some seasons, however, the larger yield of 
rye is more than sufficient to offset this disadvantage. 

61. Spring Rye. — This crop is earlier, hardier and 
more drought resistant than wheat, but like winter rye 
the price is relatively low as compared with that of 
wheat. On some of the lighter soil types in the dry 
areas this crop deserves more extensive use. 

62. Flax. — As a dry land crop flax deserves greater 
consideration than it has received in the past, particu- 
larly on breaking or sod land, and on heavy land that 
does not blow. Care should be taken to secure clean 
seed, free from disease and to sow thinly on firm soil. 

63. — Two-Row Barley. — Most agronomists have hereto- 
fore recommended only six-row barleys for Western 
Canada. The results of careful tests at Saskatoon and 
at points in western North Dakota and Montana indi- 
cate, however, that some of the two-row sorts are prob- 
ably to be preferred in the southern parts of western 
Saskatchewan and eastern Alberta. Hannchen, a two- 
row but short-strawed variety, has averaged over fifteen 
per cent, more than the highest yielding six-row variety 
at Saskatoon, White Smyrna, a two-row, short-strawed 
variety is highly recommended in Montana. 

64. Eramer. — ^^This is a wheat the seed of which retains 
the hull when threshed. It is used in the dry parts of 
some of the states for horse feed but has not so far been 
grown much in Western Canada. Its usefulness is, 
therefore, still in doubt. Where oats do not do well on 
account of dry weather it should be carefully tested. At 



96 



DRY FARMING 




DRY FARM CROPPING PRACTICES 97 

present oats is the commonly used grain for horse feed 
and where it will produce a larger yield than Emmer is 
to be preferred. 

65. Early Oats. — In most parts of Western Canada late 
oats are much more productive than early oats. Is this 
true in the driest areas? We do not know. The early 
oats are more productive in some of the states south of 
us. There is perhaps not much promise in early oats but 
it is possible that they may avoid the droughts and hot 
spells in August and yield as well as late oats. Banner 
and Victory are our best late oats, Gold Rain and 
Ligowo, the best medium late ones, and Daubeney, one 
of the best early ones. 

66. Grasses for Hay and Pasture. — The most drought 
resistant grasses for the West are Western Rye Grass 
and Brome Grass. The latter is the best pasture grass, 
but on account of its creeping underground stems is, 
like quack grass, somewhat difficult to eradicate. While 
these are the best grasses for the dry parts, it does not 
foUow that they are always profitable ones to grow. 
Economic and soil conditions will determine this point. 
Nevertheless, wherever perennial grasses are required 
for hay, pasture or soil improvement purposes one or 
other of these two will be found best. Brome has proven 
to be more drought resistant than Western Rye Grass. 

67. Alfalfa. — This is the best perennial legume for all 
parts of the western provinces. It does not yield well 
under dry conditions and only the hardiest varieties, 
such as "Grimm", will withstand our winters. Under 
dry conditions it yields more when sown thinly in rows 
and cultivated than when sown broadcast but, of course, 
the tillage increases the cost. This crop has not been 
very extensively grown where the precipitation is less

than sixteen inches, but a small acreage sown in rows 
for soiling dairy cattle or other stock will be found to 
be very satisfactory even in the driest parts. 

68. Millet. — The millets are grown only on a very 
small acreage. Their chief use is as "catch crops" in 
seasons when the hay crop promises partial failure. They 
do best in warm, moist seasons. In early spring they 
make but little headway, and they suffer injury from 
the first fall frost. They promise most as catch crops in 
the dry belt and do best when sown early in June. 




Fig. 35. — Cutting Sweet Clover at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 

Sweet clover is probably the best biennial legume forage plant for regions 
having less than sixteen inches of precipitation. 

Where oats can be grown satisfactorily for hay it is 
questionable whether it pays to grow millet. 

69. Sweet Clover. — This crop has been little grown 
as yet by western farmers. It is, however, the most suit- 
able biennial legume for the dry parts, in spite of its 
coarseness and bitterness. In those areas where the 
grasses do not yield well, and particularly where the 
soil is lacking in organic matter or for any reason is in 
poor tilth, this crop promises much as a forage and a 
soil improver. Only northern grown strains should be 



DRY FARM CROPPING PRACTICES 99 

used, the tenderer ones from the south often failing to 
live through our severe winters. 

70. Rape. — As late summer and fall pasturage for beef 
cattle, sheep and swine, rape sown in rows two to three 
feet part and cultivated has proven an excellent crop. 

71. Corn. — The future of corn in the dry belt is quite 
promising. The yield of grain is low and the value of the 
forage in the very dry parts is not high in relation to 
its cost, yet the crop leaves the soil in such a favorable 
condition for subsequent grain crops that its more gen- 
eral utilization for fodder, silage, pasture or grain seems 
almost essential on the lighter, warmer soils in the drier 
sections of the southern prairies. It is altogether prob- 
able that corn will to a limited extent be used in such 
areas as a partial substitute for the fallow. Corn 
ground that has been kept clean has yielded practically 
as much grain as the fallow at several stations in the 
semi-arid belt of Canada as well as in the United States. 

72. Sunflowers. — This crop has averaged nearly twice 
as large a yield as corn at Saskatoon during the past six 
years. Until the last two or three seasons it has not 
been considered of any value as fodder, but recent trials 
in Montana, and at Saskatoon as well, indicate that it 
can be quite satisfactorily ensiled and that the cattle 
eat it apparently with relish and do well upon it. The 
sunflower is so productive and so hardy that if it proves 
as good a silage crop as the early trials indicate, it will 
be a safe and probably a profitable crop to grow. 

73. Suitable Crop Management Practices. — The crop 
management practices the farmer in the dry portions of 
the Canadian West should avoid are late seeding, thick 
seeding, shallow seeding, late harvesting and the use 
of varieties that shatter easily or that are too short in the 



100

straw. Each of these in dry seasons and in dry areas is 
likely to result in lessening the yield. 

74. The Time to Sow. — The chief factors in determin- 
ing the best time to sow are the temperature and moist- 
ure conditions 
of the soil and 
the danger from 
spring and fall 
frosts. If crops 
are sown too 
early they may 
be injured by 
late spring 
frosts or the 
seeds may die 
before the seed- 
lings get above 
ground. Aside 
from this dan- 
ger the seeding 
of our hardy 
3ereals — wheat, 
rye, oats and 
barley — should 
be done early. 
If the seeding 
can be done

early enough the moisture from the melting snows 
will germinate the seed, otherwise in fall or spring 
plowing the germination may be seriously retarded 
owing to lack of moisture in the furrow slice. Climatic 
and soil conditions vary greatly from season to season 
and thus influence greatly the time to put in a crop. As 



I)IIY FARM CROPPING PRACTICES lOl 

a general rule, however, the following dates of seeding 
and planting will be found satisfactory : — 

April— I5th to 30th— Wheat. 

April— 25th to May 10th— Peas. 

May — 1st 10 days — Oats and Carrots. 

May — 1st 3 weeks — Barley and Spring Rye. 

May — 10th to 30th — Flax, Potatoes, Mangels and 
Swedes. 

May — 20th to June 10th — Corn, Sunflowers. 
June — 1st 3 weeks — Grasses, Clovers, Alfalfa (Grasses 
and clovers may be sown with nurse crops at 
an earlier date). 

75. The Amount to Sow. — Thin seeding is a recognized 
dry farm practice. The drier the district the less seed 
need be used while the more humid the district and tho 
shorter the growing season the greater the quantity that 
should be sown. Campbell recommends as little as 18 
to 20 pounds of winter wheat, 22 to 25 pounds of spring 
wheat, 20 to 25 pounds of oats, and 35 to 40 pounds of 
barley per acre in the dry parts of the Western States. 
The United States Department of Agriculture recom- 
mends the following rates for Montana : Wheat, 1 bushel ; 
oats, 1 to lj4 bushels; barley, 1 to 1% bushels; flax, 15 
to 20 pounds. For the dry parts of Western Canada 
rather heavier seedings than those recommended for 
Montana should be used. Of course, in the more humid 
sections of the West considerably heavier seedings are 
necessary since a thinly seeded crop takes rather longer 
to mature and therefore runs a greater risk of injur}'' 
from fall frost or rust than one sown with more seed. 
The amounts that have proven best in the average of 
many tests at Saskaftoon which is on the edge of the 
driest part are as follows: — ^Wheat, 1 to 1^ bushels; 



102 DRY FARMING 

oats, 2 to S}4 bushels; barley, 1^4 to 1% bushels; and 
flax, 20 to 80 pounds. 

76. Sow Into the Moisture. — In dry areas the limiting 
factor in germination is usually moisture. In this 
climate very little rain falls in the early spring and if 
germination is to be assured seeding into the moisture 
is necessary. Man's part is to prepare the land in such 
a way that the top of the moist soil is not at too great a 
depth from the surface. 

77. Non-Shattering Varieties. — Very great losses fre- 
quently occur through the shelling of over-ripe or easily 




Fig. 36a. — Harvesting Short Wlieat with a Header in Southern Alberta. 

This method of harvesting has not come into general use in the west, but 
with short crops in areas of lowest rainfall it has some advantages over 
the ordinary method of harvesting. 

shattered heads as a result of heavy winds at harvest 
time. In order to lessen this danger two practices may 
be followed, 1st, use crops that do not shatter readily, 
and 2nd, cut before the crop is dead ripe. Among the 
wheat varieties that shatter least are the Durum types 
and Marquis. Kubanka seldom shatters even under the 
worst conditions while Marquis is known to be more non- 
shattering than any other of our commonly grown 
varieties 

78. Short vs. Long Straw. — In dry areas and particu- 



DRY FARM CROPPING PRACTICES 103 

larly in dry seasons the short-strawed varieties of crops 
are often found to yield less than longer-strawed ones. 
It is possible that the actual production may not be less 
but the amount harvested and threshed frequently is. 
This is probably due to the inefficiency of our harvesting 
machinery; the result however is the same. The longer 
and heavier-strawed varieties probably as a rule use 
more moisture in manufacturing straw than do the 
others ; nevertheless, it is a fact that in some seasons and 
on some soils varieties like Red Fife which have a long 
straw are preferred to varieties like Marquis which 
have a short straw. 



CHAPTER VI. 
THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 

Tillage is the manipulation of the soil by means of 
implements for the purpose of making a more favorable 
environment for the growth of useful plants, 

79. The Chief Functions of Tillage. — During the long 
ages in which our best crops have been developed by 
man as he sought plants to supply food for himself or 
his domestic animals, the ability possessed by the original 
wild forms to rustle for themselves has largely been lost. 
None of our cultivated plants can compete with the wild 
forms and continue to exist without the aid of man. The 
first function of tillage is to furnish the protection these 
highly developed plants require from the aggressive 
competition of wild and useless forms. 

The first home of the human race was where food 
plants grew wild and furnished sustenance for man with- 
out his care. As population increased and food became 
scarcer these plants were fostered by growing them 
under more favorable environment. The ancient civil- 
ization of Egypt grew up where the Nile overflowed its 
banks and watered the thirsty fields, while tliat of the 
Orient developed around the coastal plains above which 
the mountain streams were harnessed and made to water 
the tilled fields. In the recent history of the race men 
have grown crops on lands that could not be watered ex- 

104 



THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 105 

cept directly from the clouds in the form of precipita- 
tion. And in very recent times we have even ventured 
to grow crops in areas where the rainfall is so light that 
crop failures sometimes occur. In such areas the stor- 
age and conservation of moisture in the soil is essential 
to crop production, and tillage is the chief means at 
man's disposal for accomplishing it. This constitutes 
the second function of tillage. 

In our cropping and soil management practices we 
sometimes create in the soil an artificial condition un- 
suitable to the growth of plant roots. If these practices 
result in the loss of organic matter, the soil becomes hard 
and "bakes" easily or blows with the wind. Under such 
conditions tillage has a third function, viz., to improve 
the tilth or physical condition of the land as by the 
pulverizing action of the plow, or the firming action of 
the packer or the loosening effect of the cultivator. 

In growing crops all portions of the plants are not 
always removed from the land. The stubble at least, 
generally remains and must be disposed of. Where 
strawy manure is applied in an endeavor to maintain 
the organic matter of the soil or for other purposes it 
too must be gotten out of the way of seeding machinery. 
The fourth function of tillage is the disposal of this 
stubble and manure by plowing it under where it will 
decay. 

The last important function of tillage is to prepare 
a satisfactory seed bed or place for the seed to germin- 
ate. It is necessary to leave the surface soil in such con- 
dition that when seed is placed in the ground by the 
seeding implements used, it will find in sufficient 
quantities the factors necessary for germination, viz., 
moisture, heat and air. 



106 DRY FARMING 

80. — ^^Objections to Excessive Tillage. — Of all the means 
at man's disposal for ionproving soil conditions and 
fostering the growth of useful plants, tillage is the most 
expensive, the most practised, usually the most im- 
portant, and generally the least understood. In this as 
in other soil management practices the causes of lower 
returns must first be determined and then the best means 
of counteracting them put into practice. 

To till the ground when it accomplishes no good pur- 
pose is useless and expensive and may be harmful. In- 
tensive tillage to control weeds sometimes fails of its 
purpose because it keeps the surface layer of soil too dry 
for germination, while the same practice carried to ex- 
cess in an effort to conserve moisture often defeats the 
larger purpose of producing high yields, by putting the 
soil into a condition in which it will blow. Jethro Tull's 
teaching that "tillage is manure" is true only up to a 
certain point. Excessive tillage is not only not manure, 
but it is often useless, always expensive and generally 
economically unsound. 

Since society has developed into groups of people, 
some doing one class of work and some another, crop 
growing has become a business and crop production, in- 
cluding tiUage, has a business or a cost side to be con- 
sidered. Tillage costs money; up to a certain point 
suitable and timely tillage always pays; beyond that 
point it is not good business. It need hardly be pointed 
out that the common error is not in excessive tillage, but 
in its being untimely, unsuitable or inefficient. The 
problem of tillage is one of timeliness, suitability for the 
purpose intended and efficiency of the operation. 

81. Implements of Tillage. — The implements used in 
tillage are of three general classes, (1) plows, (2), soil 



THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 



107 



looseners (including weed cutters), and (3) soil firmers. 
Tlie value of any oi! the three classes is determined by 
(1) its efficiency in performing the work desired, (2) its 
draft, (3) its cost, and (4) its durability. It is not our 
purpose to discuss the draft or cost or durability of the 
different types, although these are very important 
phases of the subject, but to consider very briefly the 
functions of the different classes of tillage implements 
and their relative suitability for specific purposes. 

Plows. 

82. The Function of the Plow. — The function of the 
plow is to cut off all the roots of plants, to turn the f ur-

row upside down and completely cover all vegetation and 
litter, to pulverize the soil, to break up a hard subsoil, 
to leave the surface as smooth as possible (in this 
climate) after the operation and to do any or all of 
these at the lowest possible cost. In plowing, plants are 
killed by cutting off the roots below the crowns and by

turning their vegetative parts under the furrow slice. 
The roots are cut by the sharp share and the vegetation 
is turned under by the upward sloping, outward curv-

ing mouldboard (Fig 37). The covering is facilitated 
by having a straight-edged furrow which the coulter 
' (Fig. 37 C) makes. The effectiveness of the covering may 
be increased by the jointer or skim coulter, or by drag 
chains. The surface litter, of whatever form, is disposed 
of by thorough covering. 

The soil is pulverized least by a long sloping mould- 
board (breaker bottom) and most by an abrupt mould- 
board (stubble bottom). The former is used in sod 
plowing because it turns a sod furrow better and the 
draft is lighter. The latter is used in stubble land be- 
cause it turns the stubble furrow better and pulverizes 
more! (Fig. 37.). 

When it is desired to loosen up heavy subsoil deep 
plowing may be practised or a subsoil plow or subsoil 
attachment (Fig. 37B) may follow in the furrow of the 
ordinary plow. 

Kinds of Plows. — There are mouldboard and disc 
plows; and among the mouldboard types there are sod 



THE PEINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 100 

and stubble plows of many patterns. Each of these 
may be fitted with coulters, jointers and weed rods or 
drag chains, and the coulters may be "rolling^', "knife" 



Fig. 37b. — Subsoil Attachment on Mouldboard Plow. 

or "fin". But all are plows and all have the same 
functions. 

The Pulverizing Action of the Mouldboard Plow.— 
Just how the mouldboard plow pulverizes the soil is 
well illustrated by King (Fig. 38 A). If one takes a 
paper-covered book and bends it ajbruptly as when 
about to scan its pages rapidly, it will give him some 
idea of what happens to the soil as it passes up over the 
mouldboard of a stubble plow. The relative change in 
position of the particles in the furrow slice is shown 
by comparing the line 3-3 before the soil is pulverized 
with the line 1-1 after it has passed the slope of the 
mouldboard. 



110 



DRY FARMING 



The ideal soil condition for plowing varies with the 
kind of soil and its moisture content. Soil that is too 
wet or too dry does not pulverize well, particularly if 
it is of a heavy type. Such soil is out of "condition" and 
as a result gives less favorable returns. In autumn in

4. Fin coulter. 



the dry parts of Western Canada some of our soils are 
not in good condition for plowing. In spring and sum- 
mer a better condition usually obtains. 

The type of mouldboard to use should be governed by 
(1) the kind of soil, (2) whether it is in sod or stubble, 
and (3) its normal moisture content. There is a type 
of mouldboard suitable for almost every soil. The more 
abrupt the slope the better the scouring quality, but, of 
course, the greater the draft on account of the extra 
pulverization that is accomplished. The common types 
are the sod bottom (including rods for heavy gumbo), 
the stubble bottom (including slats for hard scouring 
soil) and the general purpose bottoms. These different 
bottoms are generally interchangeable with each other 
on the same make and size of plow. 



THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 



111 




112 DRY FARMING 

In some sticky soils the ordinary mouldboard plow 
will not "elean'\ and in breaking the prairie, plows hav- 
ing rods (Fig. 37) instead of sheet mouldboards are 
used. These clean better and result in less friction and 
therefore lighter draft than the sheet mouldboard type 
and are the best to use in breaking 'loose top" and some 
other sticky soils. 

83. The Disc Plow. — On stubble fields in heavy land 
where the mouldboard plow will not clean, the disc plow 
(Fig. 37 A) is used. This does not cut grass roots nor 
cover weeds, nor pulverize the soil as well as a mould- 
board plow where the latter will clean. Where a mould- 
board plow will not clean it is not satisfactory for any 
of these purposes. It requires more frequent sharpen- 
ing than the disc, and it pulls harder; but where it can 
be used at all satisfactorily the mouldboard type is gen- 
erally to be preferred over a disc plow. 

84. Coulters. — Coulters are used on mouldboard plows 
to cut the edge of the furrow, thus at once lessening the 
draft and making it possible to do a better job of cutting 
roots and covering rubbish. There are different kinds of 
coulters such as "fin", 'Tmife", "rolling coulter" and 
"skim coulter" or "jointer". The rolling coulter is 
mostly used in the West. It should be set about half 
an inch outside the line of the landside and should cut 
at least one-third the depth of the furrow. In trashy 
ground it should be set well forward to give more clear- 
ance, while in stony ground it should be set well down 
as well as ahead. The skim coulter does good work under 
some conditions in helping to cover weeds. Combination 
skim and rolling coulters are very common as are also 
those of the fin and knife type. (Fig. 37C) . 



THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 



113 



Soil Looseners. 



Among the soil looseners — and these include inter- 
tilling machines — are those having discs, cutting blades 
or stirring points. Those having revolving discs are 
known as disc harrows, while most of those having stir- 
ring points are called drag harrows. Those having 
cutting blades may have spring teeth, "duck" feet, or 
long slanting knives and are generally spoken of as

at work. 

cultivators. But all are soil looseners and their chief 
functions are to control weed growth and to loosen 
the surface soil in order to kill weeds or make a soil 
mulch or admit air. 

85. Cultivators. — The cultivators have cutting points 
of various widths and designs. The wide bladed or 
''duck footed" types (Fig. 39 A) are chiefly used to cut 



114 DRY FARMING 

off weeds below the surface and the narrow bladed types 
(Figs. 39B, 39D) to loosen up hard ground or to dig 
out the creeping roots of such plants as quack grass. 

A type of cultivator developed for stirring the soil 
and cutting weeds between rows of plants like potatoes 
and corn and known as an intertillage cultivator, differs 
from the others in form of carriage but not in function 
nor in mode of action. (Fig. 39 C). 

86. Disc Harrows. — The disc harrow (Fig. 40 A. & B.) 
is used chiefly to loosen up the surface of soddy ground 
like breaking, or to cultivate the surface of stubble fields 
to conserve moisture or kill weeds, or to form a seed bed 
on stubble or plowed land. In view of its peculiar 
structure it ridges the land if "lapping half" is not 
practised or a double disc used. The alfalfa renovator 
(Fig. 40D) is especially designed (1) to dig the fibrous 
rooted grasses out of alfalfa and (2) to loosen up the 
surface of alfalfa fields without too serious injury to 
the plant roots. 

On account of its rolling action the disc harrow can 
be used under many conditions. In the West its chief 
function has been working down the virgin prairie sod. 
The standard disc harrow has either full round discs or 
cutaway blades usually 16 inches in diameter, sixteen in 
number and spaced six inches apart. This is the four- 
horse size. The sixteen-inch discs rotate at greater speed 
than the larger ones and thus pulverize the ground more ; 
they have less bearing surface on their edges and there- 
fore more penetration. 

Single disc harrows should have one lever for each 
gang. When 'lapping over", i.e., allowing the disc to 
extend half way over the work of the previous round, is 
practised the ground is left level and not ridged. The 



THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 



115 



gang working on the once disked ground finds a dif- 
ferent resistance from the one working on the un- 
disked ground, hence does not "balance". By setting 
the gang on the loose soil at a different angle the iuiple-

(a) Full bladed disc; (b) Double disc; (c) Spade harrow; (d) Spiked 
disc or alfalfa renovator. 



ment may be made to pull straight and thus do better 
work. In hillside work the machine has a tendency to 
crowd downhill. This can be overcome when levers are 
provided for adjusting each gang separately. 

The full bladed and cutaway discs are the two most 
common types. The former does better work although 
excellent results have been obtained from a double disc 
with full blades on the front and cutaway blades on the 
rear. 

In recent years a disc attachment for seeders has been 
largely used. The "single disc'' drill (Fig. 43C) is a 
disc harrow which cultivates the soil to some extent as 
well as sows the seed, The double disc on the other hanc| 



116

is not a harrow or cultivator but only a seeder, 
(Fig. 43D). 

87. Drag or Smoothing Harrows. — The purpose of the 
drag or smoothing harrow is to prepare a level and uni- 
form surface after other kinds of tillage, or to destroy 
j^oung weeds by exposing their roots to the sun and air, 
or to form a mulch on the surface to conserve moisture 
or to aid in covering the seed after sowing. The drag 
harrow may be heavy or light, have wooden or steel 
frames and the teeth may be stationary (Fig. 41 A) or 




Fig. 41. — Types of Harrows. 

(a) Steel harrow; (b) Adjustable harrow; (c) Spring tooth harrow:

adjustable (Fig. 41B). The light lever harrow with 
teeth sloping slightly backward is frequently used in 
the growing crop of grain, corn or potatoes for killing 
small weeds. 

The spring tooth harrow (Fig. 41 C) has the same 
function as the spring tooth cultivator. It is lighter in 
draft but less efficient. 

The acme harrow (Fig. 41D) smooths the surface, cuts 
small weeds and forms a mulch, but it is not well 
adapted to general use under average farm conditions. 



THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 
Soil Firmees. 



117 



Among the implements that firm the soil and thus 
crush lumps or lessen the air spaces, or pack the soil 
about the seed, are the home-made planker or scrubber 
and the press attachment for drills. All of these are 
soil firmers or clod crushers of different degrees of ef- 
ficiency and of vastly different cost. One may fit certain 
specific soil conditions better than another. Each has a 
place in the economy of some particular farm and most

of them when used intelligently will prove a profitable 
investment. Yet no one is absolutely essential on any 
farm. The work of firming the soil can be accomplished 



118 DRY FARMING 

with other implements though generally not so efficient- 
ly as with the machines designed for that purpose. 

There are six more or less distinct types of soil firin- 
ers, (1) the surface packers, "pulverizers'' or clod 
crushers (Fig. 42A), (2) the sub-surface packers (Fig. 
42B), (3) the so-called "culti-packer" (Fig. 42C), (4) 
the smooth roller (Fig. 42D), (5) floats and plankers 
(Fig. 42E) and (6) the press attachments for grain 
drills. (Fig. 43A). 

88. The Purpose of Soil Firmers. — The chief function 
of all six types of soil firmers is to aid in facilitating 
the movement of moisture from the subsoil to the furrow 
slice or in bringing the moisture of the soil into closer 
contact with the seed or roots of plants. On "breaking", 
any one of the first four types may be used to press the 
furrow slice against the subsoil j the surface and sub- 
surface packers are generally considered best but the 
home-made float or planker requires less power and is 
cheaper. After stubble plowing one or other of the 
packers is usually preferred. In the drier parts the 
subsurface packer is commonly used and in other areas 
on late plowed fallows and on fall and spring plowing 
it is preferred by some. It is, however, less of a general 
purpose packer, and is in reality less used in the West 
than the surface or corrugated packer. The "culti- 
packer" is an excellent implement to pack the soil about 
the seed after seeding, but for any other purpose it is 
not considered to be superior to the surface packer. 

The plankers are chiefly used as levellers, but on 
breaking their value is in flattening out the plowed fur- 
rows. They are sometimes used on stubble fields after 
seeding where some additional soil over the seed is de- 



THE PRINCIPLES OF TILLAGE 119 

sirable and where, owing to the stubble, harrows do not 
work satisfactorily. 

The smooth roller is but little used in the West. Its 
function is similar to that of the surface packer but it 
is less desirable than the latter since it leaves the surface 
too fine and with too little mulch and in a condition 
favorable to blowing. The surface packer leaves a 
granular mulch and a surface that is not so likely to 
blow. 

89. Drills as Tillage Machines. — The chief function of a 
seed drill is to place the seed in the soil where it will get

drill; (d) Double disc drill. 

the moisture, heat and air conditions necessary for 
growth. Its efficiency as a seeder, aside from its me- 
chanical faults or virtues is determined by the depth it 
will place the seed and the firmness of the soil about the 
seed after the operation. There are four chief types of 



120 DRY FARMING 

drills, the "shoe" drill, the "hoe" drill, the "single disc" 
and the "double disc". (Fig. 43). 

The shoe drill (Fig. 43B) can hardly be called a till- 
age implement. The hoe drill (Fig. 43 A) is to a slight 
degree a cultivator of the narrow tooth type. The single 
disc drill (Fig. 43C) is not only a drill but a disc harrow 
as well, of rather low efficiency, while the double disc is a 
drill only. (Fig. 43D). 

Where some cultivation is needed, such as on some un- 
plowed stubble fields, the single disc is perhaps best. On 
soils that are well prepared and not too hard and where 
drifting is feared the old hoe or the shoe drill are quite 
satisfactory, particularly on light soils. Where soils are 
well prepared, yet quite firm, the double disc is probably 
the best to use. 

The shoe and hoe drills pull easier and generally re- 
quire less repairs than the discs but on all except light 
soil or well prepared land they are not at present as 
popular as the discs. 

90. Press Drills. — The press attachment is a packer and 
perhaps the most efficient one from the point of view of 
the seed. It packs the ground where it needs packing at 
the time it needs it, and leaves unpacked the portion 
that is best left loose. But the press drill as at present 
constructed is costly, heavy to pull, somewhat dif- 
ficult to operate, particularly in sticky soil, and is likely, 
as a rule, to require more repairs than most other types 
of drill. It is coming into quite general use on soils that 
drift and is often found on medium type soils in the dry 
belt. (Fig. 43B). 



CHAPTER VII. 
BREAKING THE VIRGIN PRAIRIE 

"Breaking" is the western term for the first plowing 
of the native prairie land. It is the first tillage opera- 
tion undertaken by the settler in order to make the raw 
prairie sod suitable for the growing of cultivated crops. 
The breaking is usually followed by more or less tillage 
the same season and may include a second plowing, 
which is spoken of as 'T)acksetting". When this second 
plowing is not given the surface tillage usually consists 
of packing or "planking", disking and harrowing. If 
the intention is to backset, the breaking is done shallow, 
but if not, it is the custom to break more deeply. 

When the breaking is done in the spring, it is some- 
times sown to grain the same year. In the dry districts 
this practice frequently results in partial or complete 
failure but in wet years or in the more humid parts fair 
yields are sometimes secured. The plan usually follow- 
ed is to leave the land without a crop until the next 
season. 

In the early days, when the tillage of prairie sod was 
not so well understood, new breaking was not expected 
to give a good crop. Even now new settlers frequently 
fail to get good returns from their first efforts. There is, 
however, no good reason why the first crop should not be 
an excellent one in the average year.

122 DRY FARMING 

91. Why We Till Prairie Sod.— The function of tilling 
prairie sod in semi-arid climates is threefold: 

1. To store and conserve moisture in the soil. 

2. To kill the native vegetation, and 

3. To prepare a suitable seed bed. 

92. How Moisture is Stored and Conserved in New Lani. 
—The storage and conservation of moisture is necessary

before profitable crops can be raised on new land. This 
is accomplished by (1) killing the native vegetation 
early in the growing season, (2) by preventing the "run- 
off'', and (3) by preventing the excessive drying out of 
the furrow slice. 

All prairie land is covered with a growth of grass and 
other plants native to the district. These use up moist- 
ure in just as large quantities as weeds or domestic 
crops. (See Sec. 168). Most of them make their greatest 



BREAKING THE VIRGIN PRAIRIE 123 

growth early in the season, hence the sooner the plowing 
is done the greater the amount of water conserved. 

Native prairie does not readily take in all the water 
that falls upon it especially if the land is rolling or hilly. 
Plowed land on the other hand absorbs water more 
readily than unplowed land. Breaking early in the 
rainy season gives, therefore, greater opportunity for 
the soil to absorb moisture and breaking crosswise of 
the slopes, if possible and practicable, facilitates the 
absorption of a greater part of the run-off from melting 
snow the next spring. 

The loss of moisture by evaporation from the furrow 
slice and from the subsoil of a freshly broken field is very 
great for the reason that, not only the top of the furrow, 
but generally its sides and often its bottom, and the fur- 
row bottom as well, are exposed to the drying influence of 
the wind. This loss of moisture is lessened by (1) turn- 
ing the furrow perfectly flat, (2) bringing it against 
the subsoil with a packer or planker, and (3) disking 
to fill in the cracks between the furrows as soon as the 
latter are sufficiently decayed to permit of this being done 
without turning up unrotted sods. 

Plowing the prairie sod results in partial or complete 
killing of the native plants and in making the soil re- 
ceptive to rains, thus at once preventing loss by trans- 
piration and by run-off. Then, by packing and disking 
the loss of moisture by evaporation is lessened and more 
is conserved for the use of the subsequent* crop. The 
longer the disking is left undone after breaking the bet- 
ter the land will "work up" but the sooner the loose 
layer can be created on the surface the more moisture 
there will be saved. 



124 



DRY FARMING 



93. Killing the Native Prairie Plants. — The native 
vegetation consists chiefly of grasses and various shrubs, 
such as rose bushes and wolf willow. Some of these 
plants are fibrous-rooted while others, such as native 




Fig. 45. — Breaking with Oxen. 
Not an unfamiliar sight in the early days Of land settlement in the west. 

quack and the rose bushes have underground stems or 
"creeping roots". These plants can be killed only by 
plowing. Fibrous-rooted plants can be killed by once 
plowing if followed by reasonable surface cultivation. 
Creeping-rooted ones are less easily disposed of, and in 
order to conjpleteley eradicate them it is necessary either 
to break and backset or to break in a dry time and let 
the furrow slice dry out before it is surface-cultivated. 
It is obvious, therefore, that on land that is to be 
plowed only once, the best practice for conserving 
moisture is not the most efficient for killing the creep- 



BREAKING THE VIRGIN PRAIRIE 



125 



ing-rooted grasses; plowing once will be successful in 
the latter respect only in proportion to the dryness of 
the season. In other words if the season is a wet one, 
the perennial plants are not likely to be eradicated by 
plowing once. It is apparent, therefore, that the 
specific practices to be followed must be determined by 
the local and seasonal conditions of soil and climate. 

It is, however, always a good policy to plan to get rid 
of creeping-rooted plants the year the breaking is done

if at all practicable, otherwise they will be a drain on 
the productiveness of the land and in any case will have 
to be eradicated later at probably an added cost. As a 
rule if creeping-rooted plants are present and known to 
be difficult to eradicate, breaking and backsetting is to 
be recommended ; if they are not present or are found in 
such small numbers that they are not difficult to control, 



126 DRY FARMING 

deep breaking with adequate cultivation will prove a 
somewhat less expensive method of preparing sod land, 
and in many places, especially in dry areas, equally 
effective. 

Plowing late in June or early in July, rather than at 
an earlier date, favors the eradication of all creeping- 
rooted plants for the double reason that subsequent to 
these dates the rainfall is generally less and the vitality 
of the plants lower than before. 

For the same reason plowing once is more likely to 
be adequate in dry areas than in wet ones, and plowing 
twice more advisable in moist areas than in dry. If a 
Jong breaking season is contemplated a practice very 
much to be commended is to break shallow up to the 15th 
or 20th of June (in the dry parts) and after that date 
break deeply. The early shallow breaking may then be 
backset after the sod decays, and the later deeper break- 
ing may be prepared by disking. Land carrying a tall 
or dense growth of scrub cannot be satisfactorily plowed 
a second time in the same season. 

94. Preparation of the Seed Bed. — After killing the 
native plants of the prairie and storing a supply of 
moisture for the crop, it is important that the soil be 
left '.n such condition that the requirements of germina- 
tion and future growth may be easily and abundantly 
supplied to the seeds and roots of the crop. To insure 
that these requirements be met it is necessary (1) that 
the furrow slice be firmly in contact with the subsoil so 
that the subsoil moisture may not be prevented from 
moving to the seed and roots of the crop; (2) that the 
soil be prepared in such a manner that sufficient moist- 
ure for germination will be within one to three inches of 
the surface so that too deep seeding may not be ^neeo^- 



BREAKING THE VIRGIN PRAIRIE 127 

sary, and (3) that a mellow layer of soil be formed on 
the surface to function efficiently as a seed covering after 
the passage of the drill. The use of the packer, disc and 
harrow in the order mentioned and at the right time is 
the best way to accomplish the desired results. Ordin- 
arily, the land is firmed down by a packer or pi anker 
soon after plowing, disked as soon as the sod has partial- 
ly rotted and then harrowed to prepare a uniform ana 
lev'4 suiface. 

95. Some Desirable Practices in "Breaking" Prairie Sod. 
— Most of the practices to be discussed under this head- 
ing might easily be inferred from what has already been 




Fig. 47. — Improper Breaking for Dry Areas. 
The furrow slice instead of lying on the corner of its neighbor should 

lie flat. 

said. In discussing them it should be kept in mind that 
a practice that is best in one district may not be good in 
another. Each so-called "^'desirable" practice should 
therefore be considered in its relation to the needs of the 
situation, the presence of creeping-rooted plants and the 
average rainfall being the chief determining factor. 

96. Break Early to Obtain Maximum Yields. — The de- 
crease in yield of wheat on breaking done after the 
tenth of June at Saskatoon has been found to average one 
bushel per acre per week. In more humid districts tiie 
decrease will probably be less and in drier districts 
greater than this figure. The following table giv;?s the 



128 DRY FARMING 

average acre yield of different crops on breaking done 
at different periods throughout the year. 

Table XVI. — Showing the influence of time of breaking on the 
yield of different crops in Saskatoon — average of three years

There are two fundamental reasons why early break- 
ing increases the yield, the first being an increase in the 
soil moisture content and the second, a better state of «oil 
tilth. The increase in soil moisture is due chiefly to the 
fact that native plants have been prevented from using 
it up and also to the greater facility with which the 
cultivated land is able to absorb moisture and prevent 
its evaporation. The better soil tilth is due to the fact 
that land that is broken early has a much better chance 
to disintegrate since it has the necessary moisture to 
promote decay and is exposed to the action of the weath- 
er for a greater length of time. 

97. Plow all the Land. — Good plowing when breaking 
prairie sod is probably more important than any other 
phase of the breaking operations. Poorly plowed break- 
ing does not kill all the grass with the result that no 
crop is produced where the "skips" occur, and in the 
second and often in subsequent crops this grass increases 
and seriously lessens the yield. Poor breaking is the 
chief reason for grass in stubble fields which in turn is 
one of the chief causes of low yields on such land.

the previous year. .

98. Turn the Furrow Over Flat. — The furrow slice 
should be turned over flat on the furrow bottom, other- 
wise the sod does not rot satisfactorily and the furrow 
slice itself dries out too much. It has been observed 




Fig 48. — Improper Breaking — after Discing. 

Showing the loose, open spaces under the furrow slice which are so 

undesirable in dry areas. 

that where good plowing is done and the furrow slice 
turned down flat, rather than on edge, the sod rots bet- 
ter and larger returns are secured. 

99. Pack or Plank after Breaking. — For the same rea- 
son that sod or prairie land should be turned over flat, it 
should also be pressed firmly against the subsurface soil. 
For this purpose the land packer or the home-made 
planker give excellent results. In the dry summers of 
1914 and 1917 the only breaking on which the sod thor- 
oughly rotted was that which had been well packed. In 
a wet season the necessity for packing is not so great. 

On land that contains some creeping-rooted grasses 
but which it is not considered necessary to backset the 
same season, and in low-lying areas particularly, it is 
sometimes advisable to leave the breaking unpacked for 
a few days to permit the furrow slice to dry out and thus 
aid in killing the grass. 

100. Disk Deep Breaking as soon as Possible after it can 
be done without Turning up Sods. — Moisture evaporates 
rapidly from the smooth surface and sides and from the 



130 



DRY FARMING 



bottom of the sod furrow. As soon as disking can con- 
veniently be done without turning up unrotted sods, it 
should not be delayed. On some soils it can be done very 
soon after breaking, but on others this operation often 
has to be left until the sod is at least partially decayed. 
In practice it is usually found advisable to break while 




Fig. 49. — In Breaking the Furrow Slice Should be Turned over Flat. 

the soil is moist and the land can be easily and quickly 
plowed, and to do the disking later when it is difficult 
or impossible to plow. 

101. Cultivate Sufficiently during the Season to Prevent 
the Growth of Native Plants. — If prairie land is broken 
and the surface left uncultivated a considerable amount 
of moisture is lost as a result of the drying effect of the 
wind. At the same time if any of the native plants still 
persist they not only establish themjselves in the soil but 
they pump out very large quantities of water. The use 
of the discs and harrows often enough to prevent the 



BREAKING THE VIRGIN PRAIRIE 131 

growth of these plants and to keep the soil from drying 
out is essential after the sod has decayed sufficiently to 
permit these implements to do good work. 

102. To Control Creeping-Rooted Grasses Break Early 
and Backset. — It has been pointed out that the primary 
object of tilling prairie land is to kill the native vegeta- 
tion and increase the moisture content of the soil. Un- 
fortunately, the same practices do not always result in 
accomplishing both purposes, since the drying out of the 
furrow slice is the most effectual way to kill creeping- 
rooted grasses. Under most conditions and in most years 
both of these objects can be attained by breaking and 
backsetting. Single plowing can be depended upon to 
eradicate creeping-rooted grasses only if the district is 
dry or if it is a dry year in a more moist area, or if it is 
done late. 

The first crop after breaking and backsetting is often 
not much larger than the first crop after deep breaking 
that has been surface cultivated, but the second and 
later crops are invariably better from the twice-plowed 
land. In the year 1913, the second crop of wheat on land 
that was broken and backset yielded 14 bushels, 36 
pounds of wheat per acre, while the second crop on ad- 
joining land that had been broken deep and surface 
cultivated was but 4 bushels, 11 pounds per acre. The 
difference was due altogether to the presence of native 
quack grass in the once-plowed breaking. Single break- 
ing and disking is less expensive than breaking and back- 
setting, and when done in good time on soils free from 
quack and sweet grass often gives as good results. Back- 
setting in our opinion is advisable only in areas or on 
soils where once-plowing does not ordinarily kill the 
grass. 



132 



DRY FARMING 



103. Don't Backset if Sod has not Rotted. — In very dry 
summers it is more difficult to backset and less difficult 
to kill the prairie grasses than in wet summers. In 1914, 
as in some other dry years, it was physically impossible 




Fig. 50. — A Good Job of Breaking on Medium Light Soil. 



in many areas to backset any breaking except that which 
had been done early and well packed down. In addition 
to this difficulty, it was noticed that even where back- 
setting was done the unrotted sod produced a very un- 
suitable seed bed and one that required an unreasonable 
amount of surface tillage before it was considered satis- 
factory. 

104. Land Intended to be Backset Should be Broken Shal- 
low; that not to be Backset, Deeper. — Deep breaking con- 
trols native plants better than shallow breaking but it 
cannot be backset satisfactorily. If it is the intention 
to backset, it is therefore advisable to break shallow. In 
some parts it is a fixed practice to plow shallow in the 



BREAKING THE VIRGIN PRAIRIE 133 

early part of the breaking season and deeper at the lat- 
ter end. The early breaking can then be backset after 
the breaking season is over, "Shallow" and "deep" are 
used here as relative terms, A depth of two to four 
inches is generally considered shallow breaking and four 
to six inches deep breaking. "Backsetting" should 
usually be about two inches deeper than "breaking". 

105. Harrow and Pack Backsetting. — The moisture 
stored in the subsoil of plowed land must be kept avail-, 
able to the s'eed and plant roots. In order that this 
condition may obtain, firming the loose soil after back- 
setting is advisable. The general practice in the early 
days wa§ to harrow such land thoroughly. It is now

generally considered advisable to pack it after smoothing 
down with the 'harrow. If this is done in the fall, the 
last tillage operation in the fall should be harrowing or 
cultivating. 



134 DRY FARMING 

106. "Scrub" Land must be Treated Somewhat Differ- 
ently. — On land that carries a growth of bushes and 
small wood, backsetting is seldom practicable for the 
reason that the growth plowed under does not decay in 
time to permit it to be backset. Under these conditions 
very deep plowing followed by packing and thorough 
surface cultivation is the best procedure. 

Early breaking on ''scrub" land has all the advantages 
of early breaking on prairie land, but because of the fact 
that most of our "scrub" land is in the more humid 
parts of the country or in areas of low evaporation, it 
is not essential that the plowing be done as early as in 
the prairie sections. At the same time it is well to keep 
in mind that the earlier the work is done the more moist- 
ure there will be conserved and the earlier the rubbish 
is plowed under the quicker it will decay and leave the 
soil in good physical condition. 

107. Leave Breaking Uncropped until the Following 
Season. — In nearly all cases it will be found more profit- 
able to leave the plowed prairie land uncropped until the 
following year rather than to sow it the year it is broken. 
If a man is beginning farming operations with little 
capital and must have some cash return or grow feed 
for stock in the first season it may be good business to 
sow some crops on new breaking. This, however, 
should seldom be practised in the eastern Chinook 
region. It gives best results in the park belt and east- 
ern portion of the prairie area. In any case the work 
should be done early and well. The practice is risky 
but occasionally results satisfactorily. It is not one to be 
recommended in the drier districts because it fails too 
frequently, and whether it fails or not, leaves the land in 
poor condition for the next crop. 



BREAKING THE VIRGIN PRAIRIE 135 

Flax has proven the best cash crop for spring break- 
ing in the prairie area, and oats the best feed crop in all 
parts. Corn does very well on spring breaking and has 
the advantage of leaving the soil in good condition for 
another crop. Potatoes are sometimes planted under the 
sod with fair results in favorable seasons. 

108. The "Breaking" up of Cultivated Grass Land. — 
In general the practices found advisable in breaking 
prairie sod apply also to the plowing up of cultivated 
grass land. The drier the district the greater the neces- 
sity of June breaking. In parts of Manitoba, northern 
Saskatchewan and northern Alberta plowing immediate- 
ly after the hay crop is removed in July is found to give 
very satisfactory results except in abnormally dry years. 
Packing or planking after breaking is advisable. Back- 
setting is never necessary if the grass is western rye or 
timothy or mixtures of either of these with clover. But 
if brome grass or Kentucky blue grass is grown backset- 
ting will be necessary to control it. The former is much 
more persistent than, the latter, but even the Kentucky 
blue grass is difficult to kill with only one plowing. We 
have also found that the hardy alfalfas cannot be satis- 
factorily killed by once-plowing. A shallow plowing 
early in the season followed by packing, and then back- 
setting after the ground has well settled and before the 
growth of unkilled plants becomes too strong, is a good 
procedure with this crop. Where backsetting is n(^t 
necessary the general practice is to pack the land, double 
disc it as soon as convenient, and harrow to give it a uni- 
form and level surface for seeding. 



CHAPTER VIII. 
PREPARING PARK BELT LAND FOR ITS FIRST CROP 

The southern part of each of the Prairie Provinces is 
an open plain, for the most part free from trees. On 
the northern border of this treeless region the character 
of the vegetation changes until an intermixture of trees, 
shrubs and open prairie is found which gives to the 
landscape an added beauty and suggests the name by 
which it is commonly known, the park belt. 

109. Location and Extent. — The southern edge of this 
belt touches the international boundary line near the 
eastern boundary of Manitoba and passes generally in a 
northwesterly direction, reaching its most northerly 
point in the western part of central Saskatchewan, from 
which point it turns gradually southward until 
it touches the foot hills of the Rocky Mount- 
ains in southern Alberta. No clearly marked boundary 
between the prairie and park belt exists. In some of the 
prairie area there are places where "scrub" and even 
small "bluffs" may be found. Likewise in the park belt 
there are frequently found large areas of open prairie. To 
the north of the park belt very little open prairie is 
found, the vegetation is more dense and the trees are as 
a rule larger than in the park belt. The width of this 
intermediate zone or park belt varies from a few to many 
miles. 

136 



FJIEPARING LAND FOR FIRST CROP 137 

110. General Characteristics. — Within the boundaries 
of the park belt may be found as many different soil 
types and almost as great a variety of climatic *',on- 
ditions as exists on the prairie to the south of it. In 




yig. 52. — Typical Scene in the Park Belt of Manitoba. 



some respects, however, all parts of this region are com- 
parable; they present the same problems to the settler; 
the growing season is generally shorter and the evapor- 
ation less than in the prairie areas adjoining; hay and 
pasture crops as a rule do better than in the open plains 
immediately to the south; the production of coarse 
grains, mostly oats, is the general but not exclusive 
practice, the early ripening varieties of wheat and some 
barley also being grown ; and the practfce of mixed 
farming is the general rule. 

111. Climatic Conditions.^— The precipitation is gener- 
ally thought to be higher than in the open plains, al- 
tiiough the meteorological records do not make this very 
evident. The evaporation of moisture from the soil is 
Xtrobably less owing to the lower .average temperature 



138 



DRY FARMING 



and lower wind velocity. The frost-free season is short- 
er than on the prairies and the danger from early fall 
frosts and summer frost is greater. 

112, Character of Vegetation. — In addition to the 
grasses and leguminous plants which usually occupy 
the open spaces many species of shrubs and trees are to 

be found. From 
the point of 
view of the set- 
tler the latter 
may all be 
classed as either 
brush, or trees 
of different size. 
By brush is gen- 
erally meant the 
small shrubs 
that may be cut 
with a scythe, a 
scrub hook or a 
mowing ma- 
chine, or which 
may be plowed 
under with a 
heavy plow. The small trees are those that after being 
cut with an axe or burned off leave a root which is 
not too large to prevent plowing. The larger trees vary 
from four inches to a foot or more in diameter and un- 
less burning is practised these have either (1) to be 
chopped down and the roots grubbed out, (2) to be 
pulled over by horses or engine power and the roots re- 
moved from the soil, or (3) to be cut down by brush- 




rig. 53. — Removing Small Trees with Tractor. 



PREPARING LAND FOR FIRST CROP 139 



cutters or by hand labor and the ground then plowed 
by using specially built scrub plows, after which the 
roots are removed. 

113. Methods of Removing "Scrub". — Where labor is 
cheap the best and most satisfactory way is to have the 
scrub grubbed out by hand, using grub hoes and axes. 
In a few dis- 
tricts cheap 
labor may yet be 
secured ; where 
contracts have 
been let to half- 
breed workmCTi, 
the results have 
been very satis- 
factory. 

When cheap 
labor cannot be 
obtained scrub 
may be pulled 
with a team of 
horses. A strong 
chain or steel 
cable is put 
around a tree or 
clump of small 
trees at a height of six or eight feet ; these trees are then 
drawn out. The roots below the stump are forced out of 
the ground when the tree is drawn over, and if Lhey are 
too heavy for the horses to pull clear of the soil they are 
chopped off below the stump. When this method is em- 
ployed, a good teamster is needed if one does not wish 
his horses spoiled for steady drawing.

140 



DRY FARMING 



A plan similar to the above but in which tractor 
power rather than horse power is used is coming into 
more general use. This has proven a very satisfactory 
method, and when labor is high priced, has been found 
quite economical. By this method quite large trees with 
their stumps are pulled out, the land being then broken 
easily with a scrub-breaking plow. 

Another method is to cut the brush off level with the 
ground either with the axe or a brush cutter and then to 

plow the land 
with a scrub 
breaking plow 
which will plow 
right through 
the stumps, and 
turn them over 
leaving them on 
top to be picked 
up later and 
carted away. 

In each of the 
methods so far 
referred to, the 
brush and roots 
are piled and 
then burned. 




Fig. 55. — Scrub Cutter. 

Sometimes used for removing trees in Park Belt 
land. 



Another method frequently followed is to burn over 
a piece of land for several springs in succession in order 
to clear it of all the trees and underbrush, and then 
break the land with a brush breaker hauled either by 
horses or tractor power. This is a good way when one 



PREPARING LAND FOR FIRST CROP 141 

is not ready to break the land the first year it is burned 
over. 

114. Plowing Scrub Land. — The common practice in 
breaking scrub land is to plow about five inches deep, 
but if the roots are large deeper breaking is necessary. 
The best depth to plow depends on the size of the roots 
in the ground, it being necessary to plow that depth

which will enable the implement to turn a good furrow. 
Under some conditions a furrow ten inches deep and 
two feet wide is turned. 

The plowing is usually done in June and July. The 
drier the district the earlier the land should be broken 
and the more. moist the district the longer it may be de- 
layed. In the more favored parts and in favorable sea- 
sons elsewhere the land is sometimes broken early and 
after being well worked down is sown to oats for feed. 
Where the soil is rich and the rainfall sufficient this is 
a good practice. In fact in some places it is considered 



142 DRY FARMING 

the best plan, as otherwise the first crop following is 
heavy and weak in the straw and more subject to lodg- 
ing or fall frosts. In the drier districts no crop the first 
year is the general rule. 

Backsetting scrub land is not generally practised until 
one or more crops have been grown. It is seldom neces- 
sary and it is usually difficult or impossible. When all 
roots and brush are removed either before or after, or at 
the time of the first plowing, backsetting is possible and is 
occasionally practised. 

115. Surface Tillage After Plowing. — After scrub land 
is plowed any loose brush and exposed roots should be 
removed and the land worked down to a level surface

with a packer or heavy planker followed by discs and 
harrows. The sooner this can be done the easier the 
vegetation may be killed and the less the land will dry 
out. Scrub-breaking usually requires considerable disking 
before the surface is level enough to make a satisfactory 
seed bed. Aside from getting the land levelled down, 



PREPARING LAND FOR FIRST CROP 143 

it shoTild be tilled suflSciently to keep down all vegetation 
and to leave the seed bed in good condition for spring 
seeding. 

116. Cost of "Scrubbing" and "Breaking".— The cost of 
scrubbing, breaking and getting scrub land ready for a 
crop varies widely, depending chiefly upon (1) the per- 
centage of open land, (2) the size, kind and condition of 
the scrub, (3) the cost of labor, (4) the method followed, 
and (5) the type of soil. Ordinarily it ranges from 
$5.00 per acre to $20.00 per acre more than the cost of 
breaking and preparing prairie land. Heavily timbered 
land with no open areas costs much more than these 
figures. Very little of such land has yet been brought 
under cultivation. 

117. The Choice of the First and Subsequent Crops. — 
When spring breaking is cropped the year it is done the 
crop used is invariably oats. It is usually put in for 
"sheaf feed", but in occasional years the crop matures 
and yields enough to be well worth threshing. " ' 

When not cropped until the following year both wheat 
and oats are commonly used. Where there is but little 
danger of fall frost before the crop is ripe, wheat, pre- 
ferably an early variety, should be chosen. If there is 
fear of damage from fall frosts oats are to be preferred. 
Among wheats Marquis is quite commonly used. Some 
of the earlier and lighter yielding varieties, such as 
Prelude and Red Bobs, are also grown to some extent. 
In addition to the varieties of oats commonly used in the 
open plains — Banner, Victory and Gold Rain — Abund- 
ance is grown to a considerable extent in the park belt. 
Ligowo, an earlier, lighter-yielding oat, is also grown to 
some extent. Daubeney and Alaska, very early but in- 
ferior yielding oats, are also used. Where the season is 



144

not too short the Gold Rain variety has much to recom- 
mend it. 

Although too few tests of barley varieties have been 
made to warrant any conclusive statement, it appears 
that the six-row varieties are likely to be best for this 
region. Manchurian and 0. A. C. No. 21 are the stand-

•On the more heavily wooded Park Belt land the removal of roots and 
brush after plowing and disking is a necessary operation. 

ard sorts, although a true six-row sort known as "Cali- 
fornia" barley offers much promise. The best of the 
very early, but lower-yielding and. shorter-strawed 
barleys, is the Early Six. 

Spring and winter rye are also grown on a small 
acreage of the park belt. Prolific is a promising sort of 
spring rye, while N. D. No. 959 is probably the best 
winter variety. 

Among peas the early varieties are to be preferred. 
Arthur has been commonly recommended in the past. 
Early White is . recommended for Saskatchewan condi- 
tions and Alberta Blue is spoken of very highly in Al- 
berta. 



PREPARING LAND FOR FIRST CROP 145 

The best grasses for the central part of the park belt 
are "Western Rye and Brome, In the western and the 
eastern ends of this area Timothy is used to a consider- 
able extent. Where pasture is desired and Brome grass 
is not popular Kentucky Blue grass is frequently used. 

Red Clover is coming into use in a small way in the 
park belt areas where Timothy is recommended, while 
Sweet Clover is likely to prove more satisfactory in the 
drier parts. 

Roots and potatoes find a very favorable environ- 
ment in the park belt, particularly, in those parts having 
more than fifteen inches precipitation. 

118. The Best System of Farming. — The best system of 
farming in the park belt is coarse grains and stock, or 
mixed farming. Except for some local areas like the 
Dauphin district of Manitoba, the park belt district is not 
as well suited to wheat growing as the open prairie, and 
it is far superior to the latter for the growing of oats, bar- 
ley and forage crops. It is also better protected from the 
winds of winter and better watered, thus making it more 
favorable for stock growing than the open plains. 

It seems clear that this region is eventually destined to 
be among the safest farming districts of the West. In 
the early days of settlement the returns are slower in 
coming than on a prairie farm, but once a park belt 
farm is improved and a good system of farming es- 
tablished, it immediately becomes a safer business pro- 
position than the average farm of the open plains. 



CHAPTER IX. 
THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 

Land that has borne one or more crops of wheat, oats, 
barley, rye or flax is commonly spoken of as stubble 
land. The control of the yield of crops on such fields 
is one of the most pressing problems in production now 
facing the grain grower of the open plains. In view of 
the fact that at least two-thirds of the present cropped 
acreage of this area is stubble, it would seem that the 
preparation of this portion of our cultivated land should 
receive very much greater consideration than it has ever 
been given before. 

The surplus moisture stored in fallowed land is at 
least a partial insurance against failure of the next 
season's crop as a result of drought. The same is true, in 
a lesser degree, of prairie or sod land that has been 
"broken" and left unsown till the following year; but 
on land that has produced one or more crops the soil 
moisture is largely exhausted, and the next succeeding 
crop is almost wholly dependent upon the amount that 
falls as rain or snow after harvest time. Because of this 
it is probably true that we shall never, on the average, 
get as good returns from the stubble crop as from that 
sown on fallow or "breaking" or after "hoed" crops. 
Nevertheless, much can be done to increase the pro- 
ductive power of such land. 

146 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 147 

119. The Causes of Low Yields. — The causes of low 
yields on stubble fields are usually few in number. The 
most common ones are: — 

1. The low moisture content of the soil. 

2. The presence of grass, shrubs and weeds. 

3. A poor seed bed. 

4. Insufficient "available" plant food. 
" 5. The stubble itself. 

6 : Unavailable soil moisture. 
The first is the most general, but any one or all of the 
others may be contributing causes of poor crops. A few

of these cannot be controlled absolutely, but all can be- 
materially influenced by man and some are entirely 
within his control. Each is affected by tillage, but, un- 
fortunately, the tillage operation which produces a favor- 
able condition in one often produces an unfavorable 
condition with respect to another. Hence no fixed pro- 



148 DRY FARMING 

cedure can with profit be followed on all fields. The 
actual causes of low yield on a given field must first be 
determined and then the cultural treatment that is likely 
to control these particular causes must be given, if the 
largest net advantage to the farmer is to be derived. 
■ 120. The Control of Soil Moisture. — The low moisture^ 
content of the soil is the principal cause of low yields on 
stubble land. "A dry season'', "too little rain", "hot 
winds" are generally given as causes of partial failure. 
So far as this portion of the general problem of manag- 
ing stubble fields is concerned only two things can be 
done — (1) endeavor to prevent the moisture already in 
the soil from escaping, and (2) try to get more in. 

The moistutre in stubble land escapes in only two 
ways — by evaporating directly into the air and by 
being transpired by weeds or other volunteer plants 
growing on the land. The loss by evaporation from 
most stubble fields in dry climates is very little, prob- 
ably not sufficient to warrant any but the cheapest form 
of tillage or mulch making, if for this purpose only. The 
loss of moisture through the growth of weeds is very 
great and this can and should be controlled by killing 
the weeds when they are small. 

Getting additional moisture into stubble fields in fall 
and spring is a more difficult problem in this climate 
than keeping in what may be already there. Our 
autumn, winter and spring seasons are dry. In the 
seven months from September to March, inclusive, only 
about one-third of the year's precipitation falls, and a 
large portion of this is in the form of snow and, there- 
fore, not easily controlled. To prevent the "run off" in 
spring, plowing is preferable to surface cultivation or 
no cultivation, and fall plowing is better than spring 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 149 

plowing. But "fall plowing dries out" and i£ left un- 
plowed "the stubble holds snow." If in plowing in the 
fall to store moisture which seldom falls we prevent 
the accumulation of snow in the stubble and also lose 
some moisture that is already in the soil, what is the net 
result ? 

121. The Control of Weeds, Grasses and Shrubs. — The 
surface of stubble fields is often infested in the fall with 
weed seeds of various kinds. They seldom germinate 
until the following spring when they make their appear- 
ance in the growing crop, using up tons of moisture, 
lessening the yield and increasing the cost of cutting, 
stooking, threshing and marketing the crop. As a rule 
such plants mature and drop their seed either before or 
at harvest time, making the problem of coping with 
them still more difficult. 

In the control of annual weeds in stubble fields that 
are to be cropped again the object should be to get as 
many as possible of the weed seeds germinated in the 
fall, as most "of them will die when subjected to the low 
temperatures of winter. Some form of cultivation will 
best accomplish this result, while thorough late fall 
cultivation or fall plowing will completely control the 
biennial weeds which make the early part of their 
growth in the late summer or fall. If, because of dry 
weather, fall cultivation does not prove effective in start- 
ing the weed seeds to grow, it will in any case induce 
early spring germination and enable one to kill the 
young plants by subsequent cultivation. This is of great 
importance on land that is to be fallowed. Apart from 
destroying the weeds themselves, anything that can be 
done to insure a uniform and vigorous stand of grain in 



150 



DRY FARMING 



the spring will be of great value in crowding out weeds 
in the stubble crop. 

The perennial plants, among which the native quack, 
sweet grass and prairie rose are the most common, are 
serious pests in many stubble fields.. They spread not only

Diagram showing on the left uncultivated stubble, and on the right 

double disked stubble. Note the absence of cracks in the subsoil of the 

cultivated land. 

by seeds but by underground creeping stems. These 
weeds cannot be controlled by burning or disking or 
other surface cultivation. Plowing, preferably in the 
dry season, when the roots can be exposed to the hot 
sun and drying wind, is the only remedy for those 
legacies of poor breaking. Other plants of a similar 
nature are brome grass, Canada thistle and sow thistle. 
122. Securing a Good Seed Bed. — A good seed bed is one 
that provides the conditions necessary for germination — 
heat, air and moisture — in optimum amount, at the right 
depth, at the time the seed is sown. Too often the sur- 
face of our stubble fields is too hard to get the seed into, 
or too dry to cause germination, or covered with disked 
stubble through which the drill cannot satisfactorily 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 151 

force the seed, or the surface soil is in such condition 
that it does not cover the seed satisfactorily after seed- 
ing. The surface soil can be made more mellow by 
surface cultivation or by plowing; the moisture content 
can be more or less controlled by the same means; the 
stubble, if too long, may be either burned or plowed 
under or left uncultivated and the condition of the sur- 
face or seed bed can be improved by suitable tillage if 
necessary. 

123. Importance of ''Available" Plant Food. — All of 
the plant food in a soil cannot be drawn upon by the 
growing crop. Since plants "drink" their food it is clear 
that only that portion of the fertilizing constituents that 
becomes soluble or available can be used by them. 

The agencies causing the breaking down of plant food 
constituents in soil are more or less dormant during 
the dry autumn and long winter with the result that the 
amount of available plant food in stubble fields is 
relatively small. By far the most important of these 
agencies is moisture in the soil. In stubble fields the 
amount of moisture is very low at best and the supply 
cannot be materially increased; but any form of tillage 
that results in getting more moisture into the land or in 
preventing weeds or evaporation drawing upon what is 
already there, will tend to increase the total amount of 
"available" plant food for the use of the stubble crop. 

124. The Stubble— A Nuisance, Yet Important. — The 
stubble of cereal crops is made up of elements derived 
by the plant from soil and air. If the stubble is burned 
the most valuable fertilizing element secured from the 
soil, viz., nitrogen, passes off into the air. The burning 
of stubble also dissipates "organic matter," the con- 
stituent that helps to keep soils from blowing, the one 



152 



DRY FARMING 



that increases the water-holding capacity of the soil and 
at the same time makes it easier to work. The amount of 
this constituent in decayed form in a soil is the greatest 
single index to its "fertility". 

But the stubble lessens the efficiently of tillage and 
seeding operations, and long stubble if plowed under 
may seriously interfere with the upward movement of 
soil moisture from the subsoil and with the downward 
penetration of the roots, thus lessening the yield. Ex- 
cept on drifting soils or on heavy, tight clay, stubble is

right, land disked, then plowed and then harrowed. Note the air spaces

a nuisance until it decays. It decays rapidly in humid 
but very slowly in dry climates. In the West we need 
to maintain the organic matter content of our soil, but 
we hesitate to fill it with too much undecayed stubble, 
except in the fallow year. 

125. Subsoil Moisture Must be kept Available to Plant 
Boots. — Moisture and "plant food" are both necessary for 
crop growth. The former is often found in relatively 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 153 

large quantities in the subsoil, from which area it may- 
rise to the plant roots by "capillarity". But frequently 
in our tillage operations we create a condition where the 
subsoil moisture does not rise fast enough to meet the 
needs of the crop above, in which case lower yields re- 
sult. Such a condition is produced when the furrow 
slice of plowed land is not pressed firmly against the 
subsoil. Moisture will not rise satisfactorily through a 
layer of lumpy or loose soil, or worse still, through an 
air space. The chief reason why more fall and spring 
plowing is not practised in the dry parts of Western 
Canada is because plowed land has too often been left 
in a loose condition with stubble and air spaces under 
the furrow slice, thus largely cutting off the supply of 
subsoil moisture, with the inevitable result of decreased 
yields. 

126. Some Common Methods of Preparing Stubble Land 
for a Crop. — Among the methods followed in the different 
parts of the West for preparing stubble land for a crop 
are the following : — ' 

1. Seeding on the untilled stubble without previous or 
subsequent tillage. 

2. Seeding as above followed by "floating" or "plank- 
ing". 

3. Disking or cultivating in fall followed by harrow- 
ing.- 

4. Disking or cultivatting in spring followed by har- 
rowing. 

5. Burning the stubble in spring and seeding either 
with or without disking or cultivating. 

6. Fall plowing left rough "to hold snow", then har- 
rowed down in spring before seeding. 



154 DRY FARMING 

7. Fall plowing, harrowing, packing and harrowing in 
fall. 

8. Spring plowing and harrowing. 

9. Spring plowing, harrowing and packing. 

10. Spring plowing, packing and planking. 

The usual treatment after seeding is to pack or har- 
row or both. 

127. Results of Some Tillage Experiments at the Uni- 
versity of Saskatchewan. — On the investigation field at 




rig. 62. — Typical Scene at a Plowing Match. 

the University of Saskatchewan wheat stubble was tilled 
in from sixteen to fifty different ways during each of 
five years and the average yields ranged from 11 5^ to 
23^ bushels. In some seasons the range between the 
lowest and highest yield was 30 bushels per acre. 

As a result of carefully observing the climate and soil 
conditions and of keeping an accurate record of the be- 
havior and yield of the crops in seasons of different 
character during a period of nine years, we have learned 
that many unfavorable conditions in stubble fields can 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 155 

be diagnosed and both the yield and net profit increased 
by suitable tillage. No hard and fast rules can be laid 
down for other soil and other climatic conditions but a 
few general principles that are of wide application may 
be drawn from the work. In the discussion that fol- 
lows some of these are pointed out. 

128. The Necessity for Plowing Grassy Stubble. — The 
average yield of wheat for five years on untilled grassy 
stubble was 8 bus. 9 lbs. less than on untilled stubble that 
was free from grass. There are times when it may not 
be best to plow clean stubble fields ; but there is never a 
time or condition that makes it advisable to leave grassy 
stubble unplowed. 

In 1914 grassy stubble surface cultivated in the fall, 
produced 3 bus. 45 lbs. less wheat and 13 bus. 5 lbs. less 
oats per acre than fall plowed land that was surface 
cultivated; and spring plowing produced rather more 
satisfactory results than fall plowing in that year. On 
another piece of untilled grassy stubble the average yield 
of wheat in 1914 was 5 bushels per acre. Adjoining land 
in the same grassy condition was plowed shallow, double 
disked, packed and harrowed in the fall of 1913 and as a 
result yielded 13 bus. 30 lbs. in 1914. 

It was observed that in all cases where grassy stubble 
was plowed the yield was increased and the grass was 
either totally killed or very much lessened. When the 
same land was left unplowed, in many instances it be- 
came overrun with native quack or, in low places^, with 
sweet grass, and the cost of redeeming it was thus ma- 
terially increased. 

Cereal crops cannot compete successsfully for moisture 
and plant food with established perennial plants. 
Neither burning nor surface cultivation will kill the 



156

latter, and when they are present in any quantity in 
stubble fields plowing for the succeeding crop either 
in fall or spring becomes a necessity. 

129. The Desirability of "Working Down" Plowed Land 
as soon as Possible after Plowing. — The farmer in humid 
regions wants air in his soil in the fall. In order to pre- 
vent the furrow settling down and becoming hard and 
more or less baked, he leaves the fall-plowed land loose 
and untilled. Dry farm soils, however, usually do not 
suifer for want of air. The dry land farmer is more con- 
cerned about saving moisture than about getting more 








Fig. 63. — Tractor Plowing on Stubble Land. 



air into the land. The dry parts of Western Canada do 
not enjoy a humid climate, and unharrowed or unpacked 
fall or spring plowing instead of settling down and bak- 
ing usually dries out. 

On a new soil that did not blow the increase in yield 
from one operation of the heavy harrows or two of the 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 157 

light lever harrows the same day the plowing was done, 
was 1 bus. 57 lbs. in the average of a large number of 
tests over a period of several years. It is evi- 
dent that on soils that blow as well as on those that 
run together and bake readily in the spring similar re- 
sults would seldom obtain. On normal soils, however, 
and particularly on spring plowing either harrowing or 
packing as soon as possible after plowing is a very im- 
portant and necessary operation. 

Various methods are followed to try to prevent the 
drying out of the plowed furrow. The simplest is har- 
rowing as soon as the -plowing is done; another is to 
harrow at once, then pack and then harrow ; a third, to 
pack with a packer attachment to the plow, then follow 
with a plank drag or scrubber and then the harrow. On 
fall plowing that has been well worked down ridging 
with a cultivator is sometimes practised. 

The practical man must, however, keep in mind that 
while normally the more intelligent tillage that is ap- 
plied the greater the yield is likely to be, yet a paying 
increase in yield from the excessive tillage of stubble 
land in dry areas is not by any means assured, while the 
extra cost cannot by any chance be evaded. The ques- 
tion is not one of yield alone, but one of net return. 
There yet remains much work to be done before the most 
efficient combination of tillage practices and sequence of 
operations can be definitely stated for all soil types in all 
climatic zones of the West. 

130. The Furrow Slice Should be Placed Firmly Against 
the Furrow Bottom, — In humid climates the practice of 
turning the furrow over flat is not considered advisable 
for the reason that the soil is likely to run together and 
become too hard. In semi-arid regions, except on a few 



158 DRY FARMING 

types of heavy clay, the danger is not in its running to- 
gether too much but in its not running together enough. 
In addition to turning the furrow as flat as possible it is 
important that it be placed firmly in contact with the 
subsurface soil. This can be done by using a land packer 
or by thorough surface cultivation, or, if the plowing is 
done early enough, the rains accomplish the same end 
and at no cost. 

A summary of all our work with the "surface" land 
packer on fall ami spring plowing shows that packing 
deep plowing increased the yield of wheat 2 bus. and 
6 lbs. per acre, and packing shallow plowing, 40 lbs. per 
acre, while packing unplowed stubble land decreased the 
yield three years out of four. It was observed that where 
packing ivas done the crop was invariably more uniform 
and earlier. It is generally considered advisable, except 
on soils inclined to drift, to follow the packer with the 
harrow, particularly if the packing is done after seeding. 

131. Burning Stubble is Permanently Wasteful of Soil 
Fertility, but Of ten Immediately Profitable. — The five-year 
average yield of all stubble land that was surface culti- 
vated in any way was 22 bus. 25 lbs. of wheat, while the 
average for the same length of time on land that was 
burned and then surface cultivated was 22 bus. 49 lbs. 
per acre. ■* 

A very much greater increase from burning has been 
reported from the Qu'Appelle Valley and the Regina 
Plains, where the soil is heavier, and where the stubble 
grows longer and holds more snow. It would seem that on 
heavy, rich soils, where the straw grows tall, burning in 
the spring after the long stubble has been left to gather 
snow, is a practice that, for immediate profits on new 
land, is conducive to good net returns. On the other 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 159 




160 DRY FARMING 

hand, this method does not give opportunity for con- 
trolling the spread of annual and biennial weeds. In- 
regions where spring burning has been followed for- any 
length of time these are very abundant. 

In some older districts where weeds are prevalent, and 
where the soil blows so badly that the drift covers stubble 
fields and renders spring burning impracticable, fall 
burning and surface cultivation is sometimes practised. 
A good burn cannot always be obtained in the fall, and 
in addition this practice is generally more dangerous to 
property. Fall burning offers better opportunity to kill 
weeds, but less to hold snow and accumulate moisture. 
The chief faults of stubble burning — and they are very 
serious faults — are the great waste of organic matter 
and nitrogen and the lack of opportunity spring burn- 
ing offers for the control of weeds. The figures quoted 
above and the apparently favorable increase in the re- 
sults from burning stubble are to a considerabale degree 
misleading. There are no long time records of the yield 
on land burned off from year to year as compared with 
similar land that has not been burned off. All avail- 
able records of such tests in Western Canada have the 
fundamental fault that they are not taken from con- 
tinuously burned versus continually unburned fields, but 
rather from plots that have been similarly treated until 
the spring the crop is planted. This is obviously not a 
fair comparison of the residual effects of stubble versus 
the ash of stubble. 

The experience of the Northern States in burning 
stubble and of the corn belt States in burning corn stalks 
is to the effect that while there is apparently a slight 
immediate advantage in burning, this is more apparent 
than real, and the subsequent effects are such as to con- 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 161 

demn the practice wherever found. The best evidence 
indicates that the sooner we can find a substitute for 
burning stubble the better it will be for the land, as well 
as for the people who occupy the land after us. 

132. Surface Cultivation Sometimes Preferable to Plow- 
ing. — In the year 1912 on rich friable land that was 
free from weeds and grass, as large returns were secured 
in a second crop after a good fallow from sowing wheat 
on untilled ground, as was secured from the most in- 
tensively cultivated field. The practice of plowing for a 
second crop is not'so necessary in a dry climate on soils 
in good physical condition as those of us who come from 
a more humid area are likely to suppose. In the absence 
of grass and in the presence of short stubble, soils of 
good physical condition often produce as large net re- 
turns with cereal crops when thoroughly double disked 
early in the fall or in the spring immediately before 
seeding as when fall-plowed. This is particularly true 
in the drier parts of the prairies on land that is well 
fallowed every third year. Disking fields that have a 
long stubble is objectionable since it places the stubbles 
in a horizontal rather than an upright position and there- 
by lessens the efficiency of the seeder. Under such con- 
ditions the stubble is often, in practice, either burned off 
or the field left uncultivated. '"Stubbling in" either on 
cultivated or uncultivated stubble is not advisable, ex- 
cept on clean land in a good state of tilth. On old land 
plowing is generally advisable — fall plowing being pre- 
ferable in. the humid regions and in wet autumns, and 
spring plowing in the dry regions and following dry 
autumns. 

The average yield of wheat on surface cultivated stub- 
ble at Saskatoon on clean land has been 22 bus. 25 lbs. 



162 DRY FARMING 

and on plowed stubble, 23 bus. 16 lbs. On older and 
more weedy land the increase from plowing is very much 
greater although on new clean land the second crop after 
fallowing is sometimes more profitable if left unplowed. 

133. Early Fall Preferable to Late Fall Cultivation. 
— In the 1911 wheat crop early fall plowing increased 
the yield 1 bus. 36 lbs. over fall plowing done three 
weeks later. In 1913 the increase due to the earlier work 
was 1 bus. 12>4 lbs., while in 1914 it was 3 bus. 4 lbs. per 
acre. The increase from early double disking was 1 bus. 
10 lbs. per acre. It is often impossible to plow land 
early after harvest on account of its hard, dry condition. 
It. is sometimes impossible to get time to disc it, but if it 
is planned to carry out either of these practices the 
sooner it can be done the better the results are likely 
to be. 

134. Avoid Working Tight Clay Soils when too Wet. — 
In the spring of 1913 some sticky clay portions of our 
investigation field were plowed when the soil was too 
wet, with the result that they "baked", and the yield was 
cut down to less than half that secured on other lighter 
soils worked at the same time. Light soils are not likely 
to be hurt by working them too soon after heavy rains, 
but medium soils may be, and some heavy soils are in- 
variably injured by this practice. The chief objection to 
plowing the heavy soil in the Red River Valley in the 
spring is that it is likely to bake and as a result give a 
very unsatisfactory germination and early growth. 

135. Harrow the Growing Crop only when there is Cause 
for so Doing. — "Weeds growing in a crop decrease the 
yield. Moisture that evaporates produces no wheat. 
After a crop is up many weeds may be killed, and 
evaporation from a too firm soil may be lessened by 



THE TILLAGE OF STUBBLE LAND 163 

harrowing. If weeds are present and the surface soil 
quite firm it is generally advisable to harrow. If weeds 
are not present and the soil contains sufficient moisture to 
produce a good crop, harrowing is not advisable except 
as a preventive measure against weeds in potatoes or 
corn. Neither is harrowing advisable where there is any 
tendency of the soil to drift. 

Harrowing a growing crop is a practice in which judg- 
ment must be used. A thin stand means later maturity. 
Harrowing invariably pulls out some of the plants, thus 
leaving a thinner stand. This is particularly true on 
light, loose soils, or on fields carrying considerable rub- 
bish in the form of stubble. On fields in this condition, 
harrowing, if done at all, must be practised with care. 
A light lever harrow with the teeth tilted slightly back- 
wards is often to be preferred for this work. 

136. General Observations on Plowing Stubble Land. — 
The best time to plow, whether in fall or spring, and the 
best depth to plow, whether deep or shallow, varies con- 
siderably under different conditions. It has been point- 
ed out that each of these four practices has in different 
seasons produced the largest yields. The plowing that 
proved best generally was that done at the time the soil 
was in the best condition. 

Early shallow fall plowing, well worked down, has 
given at Saskatoon slightly larger average yields than 
spring plowing of any depth; but spring plowing has 
given us larger average yields than late fall plowing. 
The data at present available do not favor the teaching 
often advanced that deep fall plowing is always best for 
the second or third crop after fallow in climates such 
as ours where dry autumn, winter and spring seasons 
are the rule. At the same time, when plowing is done 



164 



DRY FARMING 



in the fall it does not have to be done in the spring. It 
is well to keep in mind that until spring plowing is 
finished it is not ready for a crop and may not be ready 
until it is too late for good results. Fall plowing is quite 
generally practised in the more humid parts of the 
West, but in the drier areas it is not considered a de- 
sirable practice unless the soil is in good condition at the 
time of plowing. 

Deep fall plowing gave us good returns when the soil 
was in condition, and when the autumn was moist and 
the winter snowfall heavy. Very favorable yields were

also obtained from deep fall plowing on land that was 
infested with quack grass and native shrubs, and also 
where long stubble could not be burned, providing in 
each case the land was well worked down afterwards; 
but it gave us poor results when the fall and winter fol- 
lowing were dry, as most of our fall and winter seasons 
are, and very poor results when a heavy stubble was 
plowed under and the land not worked down after 
plowing. 



THE TILLAGE' OF STUBBLE LAND 165 

Deep fall plowing as a general rule, is likely to pro- 
duce less favorable yields in our climate than in a humid 
one, and less in the dry parts of the West than in either 
the eastern or northern parts. It would also seem from 
the point of view of weed control that deep fall plowing 
before weed seeds have germinated should be dis- 
couraged. 

Spring plowing permits of the stubble holding snow 
when there is any to hold and gives less, opportunity for 
the plowed "soil to dry out. In other respects what has 
been said of fall plowing applies in a general way to 
spring plowing. It has been observed, however, that 
spring plowing for oats gives more favorable results 
than the same cultivation does with wheat, .and in- 
variably it produces more of any cereal than fall plowed 
land that is left untilled'and allowed to dry out. Favor- 
able results from spring plowing for barley have been 
reported by many different farmers. 

It might here be emphasized again that in the drier 
parts both fall and spring plowing should be firmed and 
well harrowed down, otherwise very disappointing yields 
may often result. 

137. The Importance of "Net" Returns. — From what 
has been said it is apparent that fair yields can be pro- 
duced on stubble fields. Our aim, however, must be to 
produce "net" profits rather than "gross" returns. A 
large yield is not always the most profitable. On the 
other hand a poor yield, even though no cultivation has 
been given, may not pay the interest and maintenance 
charges on the necessary investment in land, buildings, 
machinery, fences and stock. 

As long as land is cheap and labor and equipment are 
high in price intensive methods on stubble land are not 



166 DRY FARMING 

likely to prove as profitable as carefully thought out and 
intelligently practised extensive ones. Nevertheless, if 
overhead charges against the investment are to be met 
the conditions that cause poor crops must be controlled. 
At the present time in "Western Canada intelligent, time- 
ly and sufficient tillage is the greatest means at our dis- 
posal for controlling, not only the factors that limit the 
yield, but the net revenue as well. 



CHAPTER X. 
THE SUMMER FALLOW 

Summerfallow is the name given to that portion of the 
farm which is left uncropped for a season and the soil 
managed in such a way that a surplus supply of moist- 
ure may be stored in it. Whatever the future of this 
practice may be, summerfallowing is at the present 
time at least the most fundamental practice of dry farm- 
ing in the northern great plains area. Nor are its ad- 
vantages limited to the storage and conservation of soil 
moisture. The fallow may be used to kill weeds and 
cause the decay of stubble and manure when plowed 
under; it results in the development of available plant 
food; and on the pioneer grain farm it is at the present 
time practically an economic necessity since without the 
fallow it would be impossible to satisfactorily prepare 
all the land for a crop in our short autumn and spring 
seasons. 

The summerfallow is at present an established practice 
in all the drier parts of the Prairie Provinces. The 
objections to it are many and they will no doubt force 
a readjustment of our present system but until some 
modification of it is found to be profitable every grain 
grower in that portion of the open plains having less 
than sixteen inches of precipitation should plan to fallow 
a half, a third or a fourth of his land every year. 

167 



168 DRY FARMING 

138. The Function of the Fallow.— The chief and per- 
haps most legitimate function of the fallow is the storage 
and conservation in the soil of a portion of one year's 
moisture as a partial insurance against failure of the 
next year's crop as a result of drought. In some places 
such as the Red River Valley of Manitoba" the fallow is

The corn crop is replacing a part of the fallow on some farms. 

made to serve the purpose of weed destruction. In others 
it is used largely because it enables the farmer to make 
a more economical distribution of the season's activities. 
Whatever its purpose in the mind of the man planning 
it, the results of fallowing, when properly carried out, 
are that (1) the field contains more moisture than other- 
wise, (2) many weeds have been killed, (3) a large 
amount of availahle plant food has been accumulated, 
(4) the decay of rubbish and stubble is accomplished, 
and (5) the land is ready for seeding whenever spring 
opens up. 

139. The Practices of Fallowing. — The two chief prac- 
tices of fallowing are (1) plowing in June or early July 
(later in the most humid parts) so as to make 
the soil receptive for the heavy rains of the rainy 



THE SUMMER FALLOW 169 

season, (it plows easiest, time and power are avail- 
able and the land is in the best "condition'^ at this 
time), and (2) surface cultivating the land to prevent 
the loss of moisture through weed and other volunteer 
growth. Other additional practices sometimes followed 
consist of disking or skim plowing either in the fall or 
early in the spring before the usual plowing, and of 
packing the land some time after the plowing has been 
done. An .occasional farmer now fallows without plow- 
ing, using only the disc, cultivator and harrows. 

From the point of view of moisture conservation, the 
essential things about a fallow are (1) to plow reason- 
ably early in the rainy season, (2) to kill weeds as soon 
as practicable after germination, (3) to surface cultivate 
enough to prevent the soil cracking. 

Where weed control is more important than moisture 
conservation early fall cultivation such as disking, culti- 
vating or skim plowing is desirable to start weed seeds 
growing. Spring cultivation after the first crop of 
weeds starts in the spring is equally important, and 
plowing shortly after the second crop is up is advisable. 
The subsequent cultivation should be such as will en- 
courage weed seeds to grow and the young plants to be 
killed as soon as possible after germination. 

As to whether a particular practice of fallowing will 
pay depends wholly upon the circumstances under which 
it is to be used. No code of rules for fallowing are 
applicable to all soils in all climates. The needs of the 
specific field must first be known, and then such remedies 
applied as will best suit the conditions that exist. 

Disking in fall before fallowing will start some seeds 
to germinate if the soil is moist, and make the next plow- 
ing easier, but it costs money. 



170 DRY FARMING 

Plowing the fallow early results in the storage of more 
moisture and encourages weed growth but necessitates 
added surface cultivation to kill weeds and 'thus adds 
to the cost. 

Plowing deep takes more time and money than plow- 
ing shallow. It kills grass better than shallow plowing 
and has some other minor advantages, but it does not 
always give better returns than plowing a medium depth. 
On deep soils deep plowing in the fallow year is com- 
monly practised but on shallow soils that have a light 
subsoil it is objectionable in the dry parts because it 
encourages soil drifting. 

Subsoiling is seldom practised. In several tests on 
normal soils it has not paid its way. It is possible that 
on some "hard-pan" subsoils it might be worth while, but 
this has not yet been demonstrated. 

Plowing twice is advisable only where grass is pre- 
valent or where weeds have gotten ahead of the surface 
tillage machines. Skim plowing in the fall followed by 
the regular plowing in late June and by subsequent 
cultivation is recommended for the Red River Valley 
where the control of sow thistle and wild oats is impor- 
tant and for all other areas where quack grass or sweet 
grass are prevalent in the land to be fallowed. Harrow- 
ing immediately behind the plow lessens the loss of moist- 
ure by evaporation from the furrow slice, and results in 
the formation of a better seed bed but it may make the 
soil too fine and dry and thus encourage drifting. 

Packing the fallow is often a desirable practice 
but it may not be essential except on land (1) that is 
plowed late, (2) that plows up in rough condition, (3) 
that grows a late crop, or (4) where firming the soil over 
the seed is desirable. 



THE SUMMER FALLOW 



171 



Under the last mentioned condition packing is de- 
sirable on soils that are (1) too loose to insure rapid 
germination, (2) too loose to prevent excessive drying 
around the plant roots in a season of drought, and (3) 
not firm enough to aid in the rise of moisture from the 
subsoil. Packing is to be preferred on late plowed fal-

lows and in dry years. It is most objectionable when 
practised on soils that bake. A fallow that is plowed 
early may become sufficiently firm as a result of neces- 
sary surface tillage to make packing unnecessary. 

The surface cultivation of the fallow may be by 
harrows, discs or cultivators. The more soddy the land 
is the more the discs will be needed; the more grass 
there is and the greater the development of annual 
weeds, particularly on soils that drift, the more desirable 
the cultivator is, while on land that seldom or never 
blows the harrows will prove the more efficient imple- 



172 DRY FARMING 

ment if used in time. Generally harrowing and either 
disking or cultivating should alternate each other. As 
the tendency of the soil to drift increases, harrowing 
should be practised less frequently, and the cultivator 
should gradually replace the disc. 

As to the condition in which the fallow should be left 
in the fall the type of soil is the determining factor. A 
fallow left loose and more or less rough on top, or ridged 
as after a cultivator will not run together so much and 
is to be preferred on very heavy clay soils that bake. 
Those soils that slake down in good condition in the 
spring may be left in small ridges. These will hold 
some snow, will facilitate mulch making with the har- 
rows in the spring and, if harrowed at the right time, 
will result in a better seed bed and no more blowing than 
the level surface. The chief objection to the smooth sur- 
face is that it frequently holds very little if any snow and 
there is therefore a very small accumulation of moisture 
from this source. 

140. Objections to Fallowing. — But someone says, "I 
summerfallowed and my crop did not ripen — it got 
touched with the frost because it was late in maturing", 
another, "I don't believe in letting one-third of my land 
worth $40 or $60 an acre lie idle — it isn't good business." 
Another one says, "The fallow is wasteful of fertility — 
nitrogen and organic matter — and should be discon- 
tinued", another "Will not hay crops or hoed crops ac- 
complish all these things claimed for the fallow?", and 
another, "I did all these things people advise and in the 
spring after the seed was sown and just as the crop was 
coming up, the wind rose and the surface soil, because 
it was so fine, 'drifted' away and the resulting crop was 
'patchy', uneven and unsatisfactory", and another, "I

can't get the weed seeds germinated before the early 
part of June in dry seasons and object to plowing them 
under because they will live and grow when plowed up 
again", and yet another, "I summerfallowed and my crop 
was so heavy and rank that it "^lodged', was poor in qual-

ity as a consequence and cost me double what it should 
have to harvest it", and still another, "I plowed my 
fallow early in June and it kept my teams busy all 
summer cultivating it to keep down the weeds; I prefer 
to do it later because the weeds don't grow so much and 
it takes less horse power and time to keep it back — I re- 
duce the cost of fallowing by doing it later", and an- 
other, "The maintenance of a mulch as a means of lessen- 
ing evaporation does not pay unless there are weeds 
to be killed at the same time." 

141. Defense of Fallowing. — One or more of the objec- 
tions mentioned may become serious faults of fallowing 



174 DRY FARMING 

in some areas and on some soil types in occasional years. 
The fallow either in an extreme or modified form may, 
however, be defended in spite of its numerous short- 
comings. 

If frost cuts down the yield or quality of the crop, the 
cause of the low yield is not the shortage of water but 
the shortage of heat, in which case the practices of 
'^northern farming", thsse that promote early maturity, 
should be given first consideration, and not t)he practices 
of dry farming which are primarily concerned with con- 
trolling the moisture supply. Among the methods of 
northern farming may be mentioned: the use of early 
classes of grain, early maturing varieties within the 
class, early seeding, thick seeding, packing the land, less 
frequent fallowing, later and shallower plowing of the 
i fallow, and the use of frost resistant crops. 

If it isn't 'good business' to let the fallow field be 
*idle' then it should be cropped. But one should first 
be sure it is not good business. It frequently does not 
pay on heavy, moist lands and on some soils that blow, 
but under present economic conditions it is good business 
in the warmer sections of the dry parts of the West 
that are not subject to early fall frosts. When land 
becomes more expensive and capital, equipment and 
labor less costly some substitute such as corn or a pasture 
fallow may be used where it can be grown and utilized 
satisfactorily. It is possible that in some sections the 
time for a change has come. 

If the, fallow dissipates organic matter and nitrogen — 
and it does to a very serious degree — then we shall have 
to dissipate organic matter and nitrogen until we find 
a better way, because we must have water in the soil and 
the fallow is the best way to get it there. As soon as 



THE SUMMER FALLOW 



175 



organic matter and nitrogen and not water commence to 
limit the yield of crops, we shall have to restore them 
to the soil. Most men recognize this serious objection 
to fallowing, but before dispensing with the fallow they 
want to be shown a better way. It is to be hoped there- 
fore that on all soil types careful tests of organic 
fertilizers (such as manure) and the use of legume crops 
(nitrogen gatherers) may be conducted from time to 
time in order that we may know, for each of the dif- 
ferent types of soil, whether the use of any or all of 
these means of improvement will pay. 

If crops require 250 to 1,000 pounds of water per 
pound of dry matter produced, and if the function of 



Pi 


HP'PHP'I 











Fig. 69. — Sheep Pasturing in Bape. 



the fallow is to store and conserve water, then neither 
grass nor even hoed crops will replace the fallow, even 
though crops be rotated ; but both, and particularly the 
hoed crops, will lessen the frequency of the fallow. The 
yield of wheat on corn ground at many different points 
has equalled the yield on fallow. Wherever this is true, 
and wherever the corn can be grown at no loss, or even 



176 DRY FARMING 

at a loss smaller than the cost of the fallow, it will event- 
ually supersed'e the fallow. In the meantime two factors 
must be determined for each part of the country, (1) the 
relative yield on fallow and corn ground, and (2) the 
relation of loss or gain on the corn to the cost of fallow- 
ing. The method that gives the greatest net return should 
•eventually enter into general farm practice. 

If drifting soil interferes with the development of the 
crop, then the drifting soil needs greater attention than 
the fallow. Excessive harrowing should be lessened or 
dispensed with altogether and 'organic matter', 'humus', 
'root fiber', the substances that were in the land when it 
did not blow, should be put back. To lessen blowing it 
may be found advisable to grow a thin cover crop or 
pasture crop on the fallow, to grow winter rye, or in ex- 
treme cases, to seed the land down to hay. But after 
any or all of these it will still be necessary to practise 
summerfallowing or a modification of it occasionally on 
our drier soils. 

The plowing under of ungerminated weed seed should 
never be practised. Every effort should be made to 
cause the early germination of weed seeds. Early fall 
disking or shallow plowing will help to do this, but if in 
very dry seasons the seeds do not start it would be wise 
to delay plowing the fallow a short time in order to give 
them opportunity to do so. If on account of the presence 
of ungerminated seeds the plowing of the fallow be de- 
layed, it should be disked and then plowed at a later 
time. 

If the crop on fallow grows too rank and 'lodges' or 
too late and suffers from frost, then one should con- 
sider whether he should not fallow less frequently or 
plow shallower or later, or whether the pastured fallow 



THE SUMMER FALLOW 177 

would not be best. The practices recommended are for 
extremely dry conditions and not for all areas irre- 
spective of climatic conditions. 

If weeds grow more luxuriantly on an early fallow 
and the cost of keeping them down is thereby increased — 
it is but nature's evidence that such a fallow is achieving 




Fig. 70. — Cracks in Heavy Land. 

These increase the evaporating surface of the soil. 

its legitimate function — the storage and conservation of 
soil moisture. The cost of the added cultivation is, of 
course, an extra charge against the fallow. When this 
is necessarily excessive and particularly on soils that are 
ii;iclined to blow it is often advisable to delay the plow- 
ing. If this is done, however, steps should be taken to 
prevent an excessive weed growth which wastes moisture, 
and to keep the soil, loose on top and receptive to rains. 
There is some evidence that if such steps are taken, 



178 . ^ DRY FARMING 

early plowing is not essential. Under other conditions 
where the moisture supply limits the yield of crops it 
has yet to be demonstrated that early fallowing, even 
at a greater cost, does not pay. 

There is but little doubt that under humid conditions 
soil mulches lessen evaporation. Whether it pays under 
dry conditions to harrow or cultivate in the absence of 
weeds is another question. Many farmers as well as in- 
vestigators believe in intensive methods for the conserva- 
tion of soil moisture, but some recent investigations go 
to show that if sufficient cultivation is given to prevent 
weed growth and to prevent the soil from baking or 
cracking, additional tillage to save moisture by mulching 
is not likely to conserve enough to pay for the extra 
work. 

142. G-eneral Conclusions. — In conclusion, then, the dry 
lands of earlier days are producing crops because men 
have found out how to get moisture into the land and 
keep it there at not too great a cost. They "store" it 
(1) by letting the soil lie idle one year in two or three, 
or four or five, as necessary, and (2) by putting it, early 
in the rainy season, in such a condition that it will 
absorb the rains that fall and not let them "run off" the 
surface. This is done by plowing, usually in June or 
early July. The moisture is conserved after it has been 
"stored" by controlling weed growth, and by lessening 
"evaporation", the two things which dissipate moisture 
from the soil. Weed growth is controlled by timely 
and suitable tillage with harrows, discs and cultivators. 
If this tillage for weed control does not also control 
evaporation sufficiently it is questionable whether extra 
work with this object in view will pay except on soils 
that bake, or where land has been freshly plowed. 



THE SUMMER FALLOW 179 

To be most effective a fallow should be surface culti- 
vated the fall before, plowed in June or early July in 
the drier parts and as late as early August in the Red 
River Valley; on some soils it should be harrowed im- 
mediately after plowing, and surface cultivated as 
necessary (1) to control weeds, (2) to prevent the soil 
from baking or cracking, and (3) to have the soil firm 
to within two or three inches of the surface. In regions 
where the rainfall is greater and where fall frosts are 
likely to do damage, such extreme practices as result in 
later maturity of seed crops should be modified in order 
to meet the more humid and colder conditions found. On 
soils that drift the surface tillage must be such as will 
conserve moisture and kill weeds without making the 
surface too fine and dusty. On heavy soils where the 
crop frequently lodges later plowing of the fallow or 
the use of a pasture crop on it is desirable. On fields 
containing much quack or other creeping-rooted grasses 
twice plowing may be desirable — once shallow in the fall 
and then deeper the next season, or once early in June 
and again later in the summer. 

The frequency of the fallow may be lessened by the 
use of intertilled crops, the practice of suitable rotations, 
the maintenance of the humus content of soils and by a 
more intensive agriculture, but these are not likely to 
replace it or a modification of it in the drier parts of the 
prairies until land is more expensive and labor, capital 
and equipment cheaper. 

At present the fallow or corn is absolutely essential 
in southwestern Saskatchewan and southern Alberta; 
a fallow is to be desired occasionally in all the prairie 
region west of central Manitoba; but it need be less 
frequent in the park belt and only very occasionally

Indeed, on some of the richer soils in the more humid

nitrogen is a matter of serious concern. It means that 
subsequently these will have to be maintained in the soil 
by the return of manure or fertilizers or by plowing 
under legume crops. 

There is little doubt but that as time goes on modifi- 
cations of the present system will be found that will suit 
many conditions in the Canadian "West better than the 
present general practice. Sorghums are more or less 
completely replacing the fallow in the drier States and 
corn in the northern States. Even in parts of Mani- 
toba corn is now being used as a substitute for the fal- 
low, and on some soils in the very dry parts of Alberta 
and Saskatchewan this crop offers considerable promise 
for the future. The use of such a hoed crop carries with 



THE SUMMER FALLOW 181 

it most of the advantages of a fallow since it makes pos- 
sible the storing of moisture, the killing of weeds, and 
the developing of available plant food. Other practices 
that offer some promise as partial substitutes for the fal- 
low are (1) sunflowers planted in wide rows, (2) potatoes 
and roots, (3) the early breaking of grass land, and (4) 
the plowing in late summer or early fall of land sown 
to cereals and cut early for hay or other purpose. 

The advantages gained in the better hay and pasture 
areas by the early "breaking" of grass lands, or by the 
later summer plowing of land sown to early maturing 
feed crops make these practices fairly comparable in 
effect to the fallow at least in the more humid parts; 
while the introduction and use of intertilled crops, such 
as corn, where it does well, of grain crops such as 
Western Rye, Brome and Timothy, and of legume crops 
like Alfalfa and' Sweet Clover, offers some promise of 
enabling ii.^ to develop a system that will have the chief 
advantages of the fallow without at the same time dis- 
sipating organic matter and nitrogen so rapidly. 



CHAPTER XI. 
CROP ROTATIONS 

143. What a Crop Rotation is. — A crop rotation is a 
more or less regular succession of crops of different 
kinds on a given field or farm, designed to result in a 
larger net return or some improvement of the soil. 

In the older agricultural areas the crop rotations 
always make liberal use of leguminous crops. In fact, 
no rotation is considered rational that does not include 
them. The ancient Romans appreciated the value of 
legumes for the effect upon the soil and succeeding crops. 
Writing in the first century A. D., Columella said, 
"Where no kfnd of manure is to be had — the cultivation 
of lupines (legume plants) will be found the readiest 
and best substitute." At an earlier date Saserna wrote, 
"Some of the leguminous plants manure the soil and 
make it fruitful, whilst other crops exhaust it and make 
it barren.'^ 

144. The World's Best Evidence on Rotations. — The best 
information the modern world affords of the value of 
suitable crop rotations is to be found in (a) the results

CROP ROTATIONS 



183 



Wheat grown continuously at Rothamsted, England, 
for sixty years has produced an average yield of 14 bus, 
per acre. On adjoining land in a rotation of turnips, 
barley, clover and wheat, the wheat produced an aver- 
age yield during the same time of 25 bus. In the same 
rotation barley yielded almost 25 bus. per acre while on 
a continuously cropped plot it yielded only a fraction

over 14 bus. During the last 20 years of the sixty-year 
period wheat in the rotation averaged 24 bus. while on 
the continuously cropped land it averaged only 12 bus. 
This is probably the best information the world affords 
on the relative values of a good crop rotation and con- 
tinuous cropping. 

Corn grown continuously at Urbana, 111., for 29 years 
produced an average yield of 27 bus. On adjoining 
land in a rotation of corn and oats it gave an average 
of 46 bus., while in a rotation of corn, oats and clover 



184 DRY FARMING 

the average yield of corn was 58 bus. per acre. This is 
the oldest experiment of this kind on the continent of 
America and the evidence it provides as to the value of 
a suitable crop rotation may well be taken to heart by 
all students interested in the development of a perman- 
ent and profitable agriculture. 

The average yield from wheat grown continuously for 
13 years on the rich Red River Valley soil of North 
Dakota at Fargo was 13 bus. 8 lbs. per acre, while the 
average yield of the same crop in all the different rota- 
tions under test for the same length of time and under 
the same conditions was 19 bus. 8 lbs. This is the nearest 
to Western Canada of any rotation test that has been 
conducted for lAore than a few years. The soil and 
climatic conditions at Fargo are not very different from 
those in the Red River Valley of Manitoba. The data 
'Secured' at Fa-rgo emp'hasize the fact that even on our 
relatively new soils continuous cropping for a few years 
results in a considerable decrease in the productive 
power of the soil, and the result should not be disre- 
garded by the students of Western Canadian agri- 
culture. 

In China and Japan where the land has been cropped 
longer probably than in any other part of the world a 
rotation is always practised, and it always includes a 
legum,e crop, generally the soy bean. In Italy, where 
agriculture is very intensive, a crop rotation including 
legume crops has been practised for many centuries. In 
England, Germany and France and all of the other agri- 
cultural regions of Europe more or less systematic rota- 
tions are the rule. In the corn belt of America the one- 
crop system is fast giving way to a rotation including an 
intertilled crop, a grain crop and a legume crop (clover 



CROP EOTATIONS 185 

and soy beans or cow peas.) In Ontario the continuous 
growing of hay in some parts and wheat in others has 
practically disappeared until now a hoed crop, a grain 
crop, a hay crop and a pasture crop follow one another 
in the order named on nearly every farm. 

The above data are among the best available on the 
value of succession cropping as compared with the con- 
tinuous use of one crop on the same land. The brief 
summary is not fair to the continuous method since in 
the succession plan the crops other than wheat are not 
necessarily as valuable as wheat. Yet the relative yields 
are so vastly different that none will attempt to say the 
practices that produced the larger ones are not by far 
the better for the countries where the tests were made. 

145. Results of Tests at Saskatoon and Brandon. — The 
influence of the preceding crop on the yield at Saskatoon 
was studied during the years 1915, 1916 and 1917 with 
the following results : —

* In the early years of the project half of this plot was planted

one plot was provided and the yield of all crops was very much 
higher on the potato ground than on the turnip ground. 

t" Flax did not mature satisfactorily on fallow in 1915 hence the

emphasizes the value of intertilled crops such as corn 
and potatoes, and such leguminous crops as peas. The 
effect of perennial legume and grass crops was studied 
only in the year 1917 when the yield of every crop was 
greater after these than after any annual crop or on 
fallow. In this test the alfalfa land yielded slightly more 
than the grass land. 

The following yields are reported from trials made 
with wheat at the Brandon Experimental Farm in 
1915 :— After alfalfa 61 bus. 10 lbs. ; after red clover 58 
bus. 30 lbs.; after alsike clover 57 bus. 40 lbs.; after 
western rye grass 49 bus. 40 lbs. ; after red top 47 bus. 
20 lbs.; after timothy 43 bus. 60 lbs.; after Kentucky 
blue 38 bus. ; after brome grass 29 bus. 20 lbs. 

146. Advantages of Suitable Crop Rotations. — (1) A 

rotation including different crops reduces the risk of a 
complete failure. In this climate where drought, frost 
or hail occasionally causes a partial or complete loss of 
the grain crop a greater diversification of crops is less 
likely to result in serious loss than where only one class 
of crops is grown. This is particularly true where 
forage crops are used and where live stock is kept. 

(2) A good rotation aids in fighting weeds. When 
grain crops only are grown, certain weeds, such as wild 
oats and mustard, that ripen earlier than the grain, 
spread rapidly. When hay crops only are grown certain 
perennial weeds, such as thistles and daisies, have op- 
portunity to spread. If grass and cereals are alternated, 
and particularly if a fallow or an intertilled crop is 
added, all of these weeds can be more easily controlled. 
The use of perennial grasses for hay has in many parts 
proven a very efficient means of controlling wild oats. 



CROP ROTATIONS 187 

(3) Some crops increase the organic matter of the 
soil. The roots of grass crops are much more extensive, 
at least in the surface soil, than those of the grain crops. 
The grass forms a "sod", the grain crops, a stubble. 
Brome grass has some disadvantages, but it adds more 
root' fiber to a soil than any of our other crops. Western 
rye grass and timothy add root fiber also, but much less 
than brome. 

(4) Some crops increase the nitrogen as well as the 
organic matter of the soil. Legume crops such as alfalfa, 
sweet clover, red clover and peas, if inoculated, may 
leave the soil richer in nitrogen than before they were 
grown. Crops with large fleshy roots like alfalfa and 
sweet clover also add much organic matter to the soil. If 
a quarter of the land is occupied by one of these crops, 
and the stubble and roots plowed under, and if an oc- 
casional catch crop of some similar legume is plowed 
under, it is possible to maintain the nitrogen and 
organic matter content of the soil. 

(5) Changing crops lessens plant diseases. Certain 
diseases such as flax wilt, potato scab and clover sickness 
are carried over in the soil. These diseases may cause a 
partial failure in the crops upon which they prey, but 
have no effect upon other classes of crops. By practising 
a rotation all may be grown upon the same farm with 
little danger from this cause. 

(6) Suitable rotations may lessen soil drifting (1) by 
having the ground covered with a growing crop at the 
season when drifting occurs or (2) by increasing the 
cohesive power of the soil. Soil drifting is usually most 
serious here in May. If the ground is covered with grass 
or other hay crops, or even winter rye, it will be pro- 
tected. If the soil is rich in organic matter, as after a 



188 



DRY FARMING 



grass crop, the particles will be so held together by' the 
"root fiber'' that little or no blowing will take place. 

(7) Different plants draw nourishment from dif- 
ferent depths of soil. The grasses and cereals are con- 
sidered to be shallow feeding crops. Alfalfa, sweet 
clover and turnips are deep feeders. The use of both

types of crops increases the feeding ground and makes 
possible the utilization of the soil to better advantage. 

(8) A good crop rotation systematizes the farm work. 
In a good rotation the fields are approximately the same 
size,* the amount of each kind of work is about the same 
each year, and each season of the year; and the labor 
and power requirements do not vary from season to 
season and can be more easily and accurately estimated 
and provided for beforehand. 



On more or less broken land fields of uniform size and good 
shape may be Imposible to arrange. This, of course, is not an 
essential, although a very desirable condition when practicable. 



CROP ROTATIONS 189 

(9) A well planned rotation may result in a better 
distribution of labor. At present our labor require- 
ments at harvest time are large and at other seasons of 
the year small. Until some modification of our present 
system of cropping is made, this difficulty will increase 
rather than diminish. The use of more crops might dis- 
tribute the harvest season from the last week in June 
to October whereas now the grain crop harvest is practi 
cally confined to the six weeks between August 15th and 
the end of September. If biennial or perennial crops are 
grown instead of some of the annuals, the acreage to be 
prepared each year is less, the seed may often be sown 
with a grain crop, the period of harvesting is pro- 
longed, and the stock may aid in harvesting, thus lessen- 
ing the labor required. Some provision for winter work 
must also be made if this problem is not to be a perman- 
ent one. What work will ultimately be provided is not 
clear, but some form of live stock enterprise seems the 
most promising. 

(10) Continuous cropping is reported to result in 
the development of poisonous substances in the soil. 
Recent investigations have been interpreted as showing 
that when one crop is grown continuously on a piece of 
land, the soil becomes toxic or more or less poisonous to 
that particular crop. It is offered in explanation that 
the roots give off substances which are poisonous to the 
plants. It is stated that these substances are not poison- 
ous to other kinds of crops and that by changing from 
one crop to another the ill effects are not found. 

147. Requirements of Rotations in Western Canada. — 

Under our present system of farming not only is the risk 

of partial failure very great but the organic matter of 

^ the soil is decreasing, soil drifting is increasing, plant 



190 DRY FARMING 

food materials are being dissipated, weeds and insect 
pests are becoming more prevalent, and on all except 
the very richest and deepest types of soil the productive 
power of the land is going down. 

These results of continuous cropping are not peculiar 
to "Western Canada. One or more of them have been 
observed in every old agricultural region where the con- 
tinuous use of one crop or one class of crop has proceed- 
ed for any length of time. Its ill effects may be seen 
to-day in the hay fields of old Ontario, in the tobacco 
fields of Virginia, in the cotton region of the South, in 
the corn belt of the central States and in the wheat 
areas of the northwestern States. In the early history of 
each of these regions the one crop that did best wa^ 
grown to the exclusion of all others because it gave bet- 
ter returns. In the end the evils of the system came to 
outweigh its advantages and a change to suitable rota- 
tions had to come about. In the pioneering stage of de- 
velopment in the prairie and\ park belt region of the 
West, grain growing is perhaps a necessary and a profit- 
able practice, even though in some places and in some 
seasons it is attended by considerable risk. When set- 
tlers come with little capital they must first make more 
capital before they can get the equipment necessary to 
practise a better system. This capital under present 
economic conditions must come very largely from selling 
the stored fertility of our cheap land. To this extent the 
practice of continuous grain growing is justifiable, but 
after the capital is available for buildings, fences, a 
water supply and stock, some provision for establishing a 
less wasteful system should be made. 

148. Difficulties in Establishing Good Rotations in the 
West. — (1) The chief immediate difficulty is the cost of 



CROP EOTATIONS 191 

the necessary fences, buildings and stock. As a rule 
most pioneers are not capitalists, and until they can 
make some money they cannot undertake the improve- 
ments they would like to make. This, of course, is only 
a temporary objection, but under some unfavorable soil 
or climatic conditions might become permanent, in which 
case state co-operation in the way of cheap loans for 
necessary permanent improvements might well be con- 
sidered. 

The practice of loaning money to farmers for develop- 
ment purposes for a long period of years at a low rate of 
interest on the amortization plan has some objectionable 
features, but as a means of developing and at the same 
time conserving our soil resources it is one of the most 
statesmanlike measures that has ever been taken by any 
of our local legislatures. In this way'the state may aid in 
conserving its own resources, and unless it does this and 
more, the state rather than the settler must be held re- 
sponsible for such uneconomic practices as the individual 
farmer may find himself forced to pursue. 

(2) Delayed returns is another difficulty. The grain 
grower waits only a year for his cash crop. The mixed 
farmer waits a year for a portion of his crop, then per- 
haps feeds it to live stock, sometimes waiting two years 
or more before selling. The delayed returns enforce 
economy and result in greater savings, but in some cases 
at least, the savings are too dearly bought. The delayed 
return is not a serious objection to rotation practice but 
is a considerable difficulty with the pioneer or the man 
who is deeply in debt. 

(3) The low yield of hay under prairie conditions 
does not encourage its use. The favorable effect of hay 
crops on the maintenance of organic matter and the con- 



192 - DRY FARMING 

trol of weeds, suggests the need for them in any good 
rotation. Unfortunately, under dry conditions these 
crops are often so low in yield that in the drier prairie 
areas men will not grow them until forced to do so by 
drifting soil or by weeds. 

(4) The lack of a suitable legume is a hindrance to 
good rotations in many parts. Alfalfas hardy enough to

withstand the prairie winter are now available for all 
except the higher altitudes. But the crop is so expensive 
to get under way, and yields so little in dry years and is 
so difficult to break up that it is not a good rotation 
crop. Peas do well in the more moist regions but suf- 
fer from drought in the dry belt and from fall frosts in 
the north. Red clover is not hardy enough for com- 
mercial use, except in favored areas and in mixtures of 
grass. Sweet clover seems now to offer the greatest 
promise as a rotation legume for the prairies. Hardy 
strains of red clover may be found satisfactory in the 



CROP ROTATIONS 193 

park belt, but this has not yet been conclusively demon- 
strated. Alfalfa promises much under irrigation, and 
alsike clover also seems to offer some possibilities there. 
(5) The lack of an intertilled crop suited to all con- 
ditions is another difficulty. The hoed crop of Ontario, 
the corn belt, and the northern States is corn, that of 
England is turnips. In the warmer parts of the West 
on warm soils corn promises much as a forage crop, but 
in the higher altitudes and northern latitudes, par- 
ticularly on the heavy soils, its future is not promising. 
Turnips and other root crops can be grown where corn 
is unsuited, but the labor cost under present (3onditions 
is too liigh to make a large acreage a commercial suc- 
cess. There is now no doubt but that corn will have a 
permanent place in the cropping system of the southern 
parts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, but unless 
economic conditions change, the acreage of roots will 
never become large enough to make this type of plant an 
important factor as a rotation crop. The same is largely 
true of potatoes. Rape has been grown in cultivated 
rows for pasture in a very large way by some farmers, 
but this practice has not developed to any extent. Witli 
dense population and cheaper labor these crops, and sun- 
flowers as well, may find a larger place in Western 
rotations. 

149. Classes of Crops used in Rotations. — The crops used 
in all good rotations may be divided into four classes: 
(1) cash crops, (2) intertilled crops or hoed crops, (3) 
legume crops or nitrogen gatherers and (4) grass crops. 

The chief cash crops of this country are the grain 
crops — wheat, oats, barley and rye — and flax, although 
hay and potatoes are also grown as money crops in some 
places. The most important intertilled crops are corn, 



194 DRY FARMING 

potatoes and roots. The most suitable legume crops are 
alfalfa, sweet clover (red clover in some areas) and peas, 
while Western rye grass, brome grass and timothy are 
the best grasses. 

The grain crops lessen plant food and organic matter, 
return nothing to the soil and permit annual weeds to 
flourish. The intertilled crops remove plant food and 
very greatly lessen organic matter but the intertillage 
they require conserves moisture, develops available plant 
food and aids in weed control. The legume crops feed 
heavily upon mineral plant food elements but will main- 
tain or increase the nitrogen supply if grown frequently 
enough. The grass crops use up plant food but increase 
the root fiber or organic matter in the soil, and by oc- 
cupying it for a year or more tend to smother out 
annual weeds. 

150. Planning a Rotation. — The establishing of suit- 
able rotations in all new agricultural countries has been 
a slow process. So many different factors enter into the 
probl-^m that the conservative farmer prefers to let some 
one else do the testing, at least so long as his present 
methods are profitable. Chief among the factors that 
must be considered when one is planning a rotation 
are : — 

1. The need that exists for improving one's own soil 
conditions and controlling weeds. 

2. The future requirements of the soil from the fer- 
tility standpoint. 

3. The particular effect of different classes of crops on 
the land. 

4. The relative suitability of different classes of crops 
to the climatic and soil conditions that obtain in 
the district. 



CROP ROTATIONS 195 

5. The economic distribution of labor throughout the 
year. 

6. The extent to which financial considerations make 
necessary the growing of cash crops, 

7. The availability and cost of capital. 

8. The extent to which the rotation is likely to lessen 
the risk of farming and insure commensurate re- 
turns for the extra investment required. 

151. Some Well Known Rotations. — The most common 
rotation in England is turnips, grain, clover and grain ; 
the old Norfolk rotation of Rothamsted is turnips, barley, 
clover and wheat. 

The most common rotation of Ontario and the mixed 
farming districts of the northeastern States is hoed crop, 
grain, hay and pasture, although many modifications of 
this are practised. Corn, oats, hay (timothy and red 
clover) and pasture is the chief rotation of the stock- 
growing and dairying districts. 

In the corn belt of the United States, corn often 
alternates with oats, but the best rotation from the point 
of view of soil productiveness is one or two crops of 
corn followed by oats and then clover. 

In the spring wheat regions of the Great Plains Region 
of America the pioneer rotation is fallow followed by 
grain for two or three years. In the northwestern States 
this is generally giving way to corn followed by two or 
three grain crops. In the Southern Great Plains Region 
the sorghums are gradually replacing the fallow, while in 
the Prairie Provinces of Canada no improvement in the 
original fallow and grain rotation has yet established 
itself, although several modifications of it are in a fair 
way to do so in some parts. 



196 DRY FARMING 

152. Rotations now used in the West.— The cropping 
systems now followed in the Canadian West vary in dif- 
ferent parts. The following are some of the most 
common : — 

1. Fallow, wheat, and wheat or oats. This rotation 
is used in the drier parts of the prairie area. In the ex- 
tremely dry areas a few men fallow the land every sec- 
ond year. 

2. Fallow, wheat, wheat, and oats or barley — used in 
the more moist parts of the prairies. 

3. Fallow, oats, wheat, oats, and barley— used in the 
higher altitudes or northern areas of prairie or park belt 
where the frost-free period is somewhat shorter than in 
the southern part of the prairie belt. 

4. Oats and barley for hay, wheat, wheat, oats or 
barley — used in the more humid short season parts where 
the fallow crop is often too late to be profitable. 

5. Fallow or breaking, wheat, oats, hay, pasture — used 
to some extent in mixed farming areas where the pre- 
cipitation is low. 

. The rotations of the future for the prairie areas must 
includle a gi^in crop, a legume crop, and a fallow, or 
where it can be profitably grown, an intertilled crop. 
In the early years at least they will necessarily include 
one or more cash crops. 

What the cash crops will be, climate and soil condi- 
tions will determine. Wheat, oats, barley and rye, in 
some areas flax, and in some alfalfa, timothy and potatoes 
may be used. The grass crops will likely be confined to 
Western rye grass, brome grass and timothy, although 
some Kentucky blue grass, red top and meadow fescue 
may be grown. The most profitable legume crops for 
short rotations are sweet clover and peas, and for long 



CROP ROTATIONS 197 

rotations, alfalfa. The most promising intertilled crop 
in the South is corn. No hoed crop suited to large 
acreages is available for the North, although a small 
acreage of roots and sunflowers may very profitably be 
grown in this area. 

153. Rotation Tests at Brandon. — The general con- 
clusions from eight years' work with different crop ro- 
tations at the Experimental Farm at Brandon have been 
summarized by Mr. W. C. McKilUican, the Superin- 
tendent of the Farm, in a discussion of the rotations 
known as "E", "F", "G", "H", "I'' and "W" as follows :— 

"The rotations under test at Brandon are as follows : — 

154, "Typical Grain Farming Rotations. — 

Rotation "E":— 

1st year — "Wheat. 

2nd year — Wheat. 

3rd year — Oats. 

4th year — Fallow. 
"This is the typical grain farming rotation of Mani- 
toba. No manure is applied at any time. This rotation 
has the fallow for a cleaning season, has three cash 
crops, but no fodder crop unless the oats are used in that 
way, and no leguminous crop. By means of the fallow 
it conserves moisture and makes plant food more readily 
available for the crop that follows, and attempts at least 
to control weeds. It makes no attempt to return any- 
thing to the soil, so that gradual depletion and increased 
tendency to blow are the inevitable results. During the 
time that prairie soils are giving up their virgin fertility, 
good results are obtained from this rotation, but it 
cannot continue indefinitely. 

Rotation "D":— 
"This rotation has exactly the same order of crops as 



198 DRY FARMING 

"E", but has this difference, that once in four years an 
application of manure is given, This manure should 
help to keep the soil from less rapid exhaustion than 
where there is none applied. However, in the actual re- 
sults at Brandon the increased returns from the manure 
have not as yet been sufficiently great to pay for the 
cost of application. It is expected that greater com- 
parative returns from the manure will be obtained after 
the cumulative results of longer application are felt. 

155. "A Well Balanced Kotation. — 
Rotation "F" :— 
1st year — Wheat. 
2nd year — Wheat. 
3rd year — Corn. 
4th year— Oats or barley (seeded 

down). 
5th year — Hay (clover and grasses). 

"This rotation fills the requirements as v/ell as any for 
Manitoba conditions. Two crops of wheat and one of 
oats or barley place a good, proportion (three-fifths) 
of the land in grain, which is the cash crop of Manitoba. 
The year of corn provides a cleaning season and also a 
large amount of fodder. The year of hay adds to the 
fodder supply and includes a leguminous crop. The hay 
land plowed in July and well cultivated makes a very 
good preparation for wheat. The corn land makes a 
good preparation for oats or barley and also for the 
grass seed sown with these crops. The proportion of 
corn is too large for most Manitoba farms, but this could 
be reduced in actual practice by having the field partly 
in corn and partly in summerfallow. Manure is ap- 
plied before the corn crop in this rotation. 



CROP ROTATIONS , 199 

"This rotation has given very good results at Brandon. 
Not only does it provide for the maintenance of the soil, 
but it is giving greater returns at present than either 
rotation "E" or "D". The average profit of this rota- 
tion for the five years— 1914^1918— was 81 per cent, 
greater than that obtained from "E" the straight grain 
growing rotation. 

156. "The Most Profitahle Rotation at Brandon.* :— 

Rotation "G":— 

1st year — "Wheat. 

2nd year — Wheat. 

3rd year — Oats or barley. 

4th year — Hay (clover and grass). 

5th year — Pasture. 

6th year — Corn. 
"This rotation is somewhat similar in character to the 
last one. It includes the same kinds of crops, but 
changes the order somewhat, the wheat coming after the 
corn instead of after the hay and the coarse grain crop 
following the wheat instead of coming after the corn. 
This arrangement makes an excellent and extremely 
profitable wheat crop, but it gives less suitable condi- 
tions for seeding down. It gives better conditions for 
corn (on sod) than the other where the corn follows the 
wheat. It has a year of pasture and in that differs from 

•Writing of this rotation at the Scott Experimental Farm in 
Western Saskatchewan, Superintendent Tinline says: "While the 
profits from the hay are not large, and the pasture barely pays 
expenses, yet the increased profits from the succeeding grain 
crops, topjether with the decreased cost of. keeping weeds under 
control, has made this rotation unusually profitable. The aver- 
age net profit for the past four years amounted to $7.88 per 
acre as compared with $5.46 from the grain rotation — fallow, 
wheat, and wheat." 



200 DRY FARMING 

"F" which makes no provision for pasture. Manure is 
applied for corn as in "F". 

"This rotation has also given good results at Brandon : 
Its average profit for five years excels that of the straight 
grain growing rotation by 155 per cent. ; it has been the 
most profitable rotation tried on the farm. However, 
seeding down with the third crop of grain would not be 
successful in all parts of Manitoba and that feature 
might rule it out in some places. The large proportion 
of corn would also have to be modified in actual farm 
practice as in the preceding rotation.

Rotation "F:— 

1st year — Flax. 

2nd year — Oats. 

3rd year — Fallow. 

4th year — ^Wheat. 

5th year — Hay (clover and grass). 

6th year — Pasture. 
"These two rotations are very similar in type, the only 
difference being a change from wheat to flax as the first 
crop and the interchanging of the wheat and oat crops. 
They differ from "F" and "G", in that they do not in- 
clude corn, but keep to the summerfallow as the means 
of cleaning the land. They include fodder and 
leguminous crops and are therefore more permanent in 



CROP ROTATIONS 201 

their character than rotations "E" and "D". Manure is 
applied on the pasture and plowed in, 

"These rotations have been more profitable than "E" 
and "D", but not so profitable as "F" and "G". On the 
other hand, the absence of corn makes the labor problem 
more easily handled than where corn is largely grown. 
Taking "E" as the standard again, rotation "H" has 
beaten its profits on a five-year average by 49 per cent,, 
and rotation "I" has done a little better. 

158, "A Rotation for a Dairy or Stock Farm, — 
Rotation "W" :— 

1st year — Wheat, 

2nd year — Wheat, 

3rd year — Corn, 

4th year — Oats, 

5th year — Barley, 

6th year — Alfalfa (sown alone). 

7th year— -Alfalfa, 

8th year — Alfalfa, 

9th year — Alfalfa, 

10th year — Alfalfa plowed up after 
first cutting, 
"This rotation is not intended for the ordinary mixed 
farm but for a dairy or pure-bred stock farm where the 
production of a large amount of high class fodder is 
more important than wheat. It includes all the require- 
ments of a permanent rotation and should build up the 
fertility of the land more than any of the others. Man- 
ure is applied twice in the circuit, for corn, and as a 
top dressing on alfalfa, 

"Being so long, it has not got a proper start as com- 
pared to the other rotations. Its profit per acre for the 



202 DRY FARMING 

same five years exceed "E" by 145 per cent., being sec- 
ond only to rotation "Gr" in profitableness. The indi- 
cations are that it will soon take the lead." 

159. Observations on Rotation Tests at Brandon. — 
"From observing the results obtained from these rota- 
tions and from farming conditions in Manitoba gener- 
ally for a number of years, the following conclusions 
among others have been reached : — 

1. A good mixed farming rotation not only provides 
for the future condition of the soil, but it gives a larger 
per cent, profit than straight grain growing. 
- 2. Corn is an exceedingly valuable rotation crop, not 
only for its fodder value, but because the grain crops 
following it are the most profitable on the farm. 

3. It is impossible to control soil blowing and wild 
oats by a straight grain and fallow system, no matter 
how well you cultivate. Grasses control both satis- 
factorily. 

4. The longer the start of mixed farming is postponed 
the more difficult it is to start. 

5. The most profitable way to use grasses is in a short 
rotation. Left in sod too long they become unpro- 
ductive and hard to break up. 

6. There is no best rotation for all farms. Each indi- 
vidual case must be studied by itself and a rotation de- 
vised that will suit the kind of soil, the degree of weed 
infestation, the rainfall that may be expected, the con- 
venience to market of the farm, and the plans, oppor- 
tunities and limitations of the man who supplies the 
brains." 

160. Mixed Farming Rotations at Lacombe. — The mixed 
farming rotations being compared at the Lacombe Ex- 
perimental Farm in central Alberta have been sum- 



CROP ROTATIONS • 203 

marized by tlie ex- superintendent, Mr. Hutton, 
as follows : — 

"Since corn is a practical crop over a relatively small 
section of the West where mixed farming is most gen- 
erally practised, and since the growing of roots on such 
a scale as would be necessary is prohibitive owing to the 
high cost of labor and the difficulty of housing, the 
rotation scheme has at once been set aside by many 
farmers. 

"The fact that within the last half dozen years the 
growing of oats alone or peas and oats sown together, for 
use as ensilage, has been successful, puts an entirely dif- 
ferent light on this phase of agriculture. While the 
objection may be raised that the growing of green feed 
does not clean the land to the same extent as is done 
where corn or roots are raised, yet the growing of green 
feed for ensilage does clean the land to some extent, 
since two or three crops of weeds may be destroyed be- 
fore the crop for ensilage is sown. It is a thoroughly 
practical crop and provides ensilage that is at once high- 
ly palatable and nutritious. It readily forms a part of 
any rotation and is more economically produced than 
roots and much safer than corn since there is no area 
where its culture can be questioned because of unsuit- 
ability to climatic conditions. 

"Among the rotations which are at all suitable where 
mixed farming is practised are the following : — * 
"Rotation "L" :— 

1st year — Hay. 

2nd year — Pasture. Manure 12 tons 
per acre. 

3rd year — Pasture. 

4th year — Wheat. 



204 DRY FARMING 

5th year — Oats. 

6th year — Barley, seeded down to 
timothy, alsike and red clover. 
Rotation "K" :— 

1st year — Hoed crop. 

2nd year — Wheat. 

3rd year — Barley, seeded down. 

4th year — Hay. Manure 12 tons per 
acre. 

5th year — Pasture. 

6th year — Pasture. 
Rotation ''0" :— 

1st year — Hoed crop. 

2nd year — "Wheat. 

3rd year — Oats. 

4th year — Summerfallow. 

5th year — Barley, seeded down. 

6th year — Hay. 

7th year — Pasture. 
161. Criticisms of these Rotations. — "The rotation first 
named, known as Rotation "L", has been modified 
slightly at the Lacombe Experimental Farm, and is now 
operated on a block of 240 acres and is known as the 
*Main Farm Rotation'. The chief objection to the ro- 
tation as it is shown above will be pointed out when 
considering the modifications that have been introduced. 
"In discussing Rotation "K" the objections already 
raised to the growing of hoed crops on a large scale 
obtain. Where corn is a doubtful crop, as it is over a 
very large proportion of the West, particularly those 
areas adapted to mixed farming, no other hoed crop is 
practical. No one would think of having a sixth of his 
farm in roots or hoed crops other than corn. 



CROP ROTATIONS 205 

"The objections to Rotation "0" lie in the fact that it 
requires one-seventh of the land in hoed crop and also 
one-seventh in summerfallow. For areas such as this 
(central Alberta) . . . the summerfallow provides 
too much free fertility and stores sufficient moisture to 
produce a tremendous growth of straw, with the result 
that the crop invariably lodges, does not fill well and 
ripens irregularly. It is admitted that a better crop 
than barley could be selected to follow the sumpier- 
f allow, but no matter what cereal is sown the crop will 
lodge nine years out of ten. 

162. A Rotation with many Advantages — " The rota- 
tion modifications as introduced in Rotation "L" are as 
follows : — 

1st year — Hay. Manure 12 tons per 

acre. 
2nd year — Pasture. 
3rd year — Pasture. Plow six inches 
deep July or August, pack, culti- 
vate and fall cultivate thoroughly. 
4th year — Oats, or oats and peas, for 
\ ensilage. 

5th year — Oats. 

6th year — Barley, seeded down, tim- 
othy and alsike clover. 
"At the Lacombe Experimental Farm, as already 
stated, this rotation covers about 240 acres of land, and 
from the 40 acre field seeded to green feed we have this 
year filled one silo 12 x 30, one 16 x 36, and had suf- 
ficient crop on the field to have filled a third silo as large 
as the largest of those in use. The dairy consumption 
per head for dairy cattle, where the silage constitutes 
the chief part of the ration, runs only from 40 to 45 



206 DRY FARMING 

pounds. Since from eight to ten tons are taken from 
each acre the stock-carrying capacity of the land is 
readily seen to be tremendously increased, as from two 
to two-and-a-half head of mature animals to the acre 
can be comfortably carried through the winter. 

"This rotation has several distinct advantages, par- 
ticularly for those areas where well-tilled summerfal- 
lows result in too great a growth of straw the following 
year. The fall cultivation given the summer plowed 
sod is sufficient to produce a maximum crop without 
carrying so much fertility and moisture as to cause 
the crop to lodge seriously. 

"The application of farm-yard manure at the rate of 
12 tons per acre maintains soil fertility while the plow- 
ing under of the sod once in six years adds root fiber 
to the soil. One advantage in connection with the ap- 
plication of manure on the sod consists in the fact that 
during the rainy season weed seeds contained in the 
manure germinate, but fail to develop for the reason 
that the manure soon dries out and the young plants 
are destroyed. 

"There being but one year of the rotation in hay a 
maximum crop results; the application of the manure 
on the sod induces a free growth of grass for pasture, 
both the year the application is made and the one im- 
mediately following. ... As has already been pointed 
out, the year following the breaking of the sod there 
has also been produced a maximum crop every year the 
rotation has been under way. If good cultivation is 
given land under this system the fifth and sixth years 
also produce satisfactory results." 

163. Rotations with Sweet Clover. — A few farmers are 
testing a two-year rotation consisting of wheat seeded 



CROP ROTATIONS 



207 



to sweet clover, the sweet clover to be pastured in fall 
and spring and then plowed under in June. They 
plan to reserve as much sweet clover for hay and 
pasture as may be necessary. Some combination of 
crops including sweet clover offers much promise for 
the whole prairie area. If a strain of this crop, hardy 
enough to live through our winters after being sown 
with a nurse crop, can be developed, a very promising 
rotation for much of the prairie area will be (1) fallow 
or hoed crop, (2) grain, (3) grain, (seeded with sweet 
clover or a grass mixture), and (4) sweet clover. Such 
a rotation might be shortened up to three years if 
thought advisable by omitting one of the grain crops. 
(See "Crop Rotations" in "Dry Farming Practices in 
South Dakota", chapter xvi). 

164. An Adjustable Rotatioii that may be made to 
meet almost every condition of climate and soil is as 
follows : —

165, Crop Rotations for Special Conditions. — A crop 
rotation planned to control annual weeds should have a 
grass crop. One to control soil drifting should have a 
grass crop or a crop such as winter rye or sweet clover 
that occupies the land when blowing ordinarily occurs. 
A rotation in dry areas should include either a fallow or 



208 DRY FARMING 

an intertilled crop, such as corn, at frequent intervals, 
while one in a short season in humid regions need have 
no fallow if mixed grass and legume crops arc grown 
occasionally and the sod plowed immediately after har- 
vesting the hay. 

The difficulty in applying these practices to western 
conditions lies in the delayed returns and relatively low 
yields from the crops classed as grass, legume or hoed 
crops. In proportion as each is unprofitable in any 
community it will, of course, have to be omitted from 
the rotation, and some other measures taken for meet- 
ing the soil conditions the rotation is designed to correct. 

166. The Effect of Rotations on Soil Fertility. — It is 
sometimes stated that a good crop rotation will main- 
tain the fertility of the soil. This is quite erroneous, 
A good rotation will result in keeping up the produc- 
tiveness of land much longer than continuous crop- 
ping either with or without fallowing, but it will main- 
tain the plant food content of only one element, viz., 
nitrogen, and this only if legumes are grown frequently' 
enough and a portion of the crop turned under occa- 
sionally. It is generally considered that the nitrogen 
can be maintained without fertilizers if about one- 
fourth of -the land is kept in legume crops and a part of 
the crop or an occasional catch crop of some other 
legume plowed under and the crop residues returned 
to the land. The other important elements of plant food 
are, of C(^urse, used up faster in a rotation than in con- 
tinuous cropping and eventually they will have to be 
kept up by using manure or commercial fertilizers or 
both. The value of a good crop rotation is not in its 
maintaining the plant food content of the soil (except 
nitrogen) but in its other beneficial effects. To per- 



CROP ROTATIONS 209 

nanently maintain productiveness without live stock, 
lot only is a good rotation necessary but also the use 
)f commercial fertilizers. In systems of live stock 
'arming when all the crop residues, such as straw and 
itubble and manure are returned to the land, soil pro- 
luctiveness may be maintained for an indefinitely longer 
ime than in systems of grain growing that do not in- 
Audie legume crops and' coimmeroiial fertrliizers. Yet even 
ive stoick fanning is' not a permanent system, except 
vhen butter and notlhiing else is soldi from the farm. 




rig. 75. — Cattle Wintering Outside, Protected only by the Trees. 
• — Courtesy Man. Dept. of Agr. 

Unfortunately the most permanent system is not al- 
vays the best for immediate results. The farmer natur- 
illy and perhaps legitimately considers that system best 
vhich gives the most profit at the present time. The 
problem of the future lies in finding for each soil and 
ilimatic zone the system that is at once the most profit- 
ible and the most permanent. 

167. General Conclusions Regarding Rotations. — No 
permanent profitable rotations have yet established 
;hemselves in this country. It is probable that in addi- 
iion to the money crops ordinarily grown, the fallow, 



210 DRY FARMING 

or a modification of it, will necessarily form a part of 
the rotations of the immediate future at least in the 
prairie area outside southern Manitoba; that corn, po- 
tatoes, roots or early plowed grass land may become 
partial substitutes for the fallow or an addition to the ro- 
tation in some areas ; that alfalfa in the irrigated sections, 
sweet clover in the prairie area and possibly red clover 
in some favored humid regions will be the most satis- 
factory legumes; and that Western rye grass, brome 
grass and timothy will be the most suitable grasses. 
What the most profitable cash crops will be— whether 
wheat, oats, barley, rye, flax, potatoes, alfalfa or tim- 
othy depends chiefly upon the moisture and temper- 
ature and to some extent the soil and market conditions 
found in each climatic zone and on each type of soil. 
*^-->A rotation designed to store moisture should include 
■'<r''^::^^^alio^ipor an intertilled crop, or in more moist parts, a 
hay^HjrtTAcuj; early, the land to be plowed immediately ; 
or it may include any two or all three of these. 

If the chief purpose of the rotation is to control soil 
drifting it should include any one or any combination 
of the following, — a grass crop which protects the land 
and at the same time adds fiber to it, a cover crop, such 
as winter rye which only protects the land, or a crop 
such as sweet clover which protects the land and adds 
fiber and nitrogen to it. 

The length of the rotation or the period between 
fallows or hoed crops will vary with the rainfall. In 
dry areas one or other of these means of storing moisture 
in the soil will necessarily come at least every third 
year but in the more humid regions it need not be used 
so frequently. In the latter the fallow may eventually 
be partially or wholly replaced by hoed crops or the 
early breaking of grass land. 



CHAPTEK XII. 
WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 

Weeds are plants which interfere with the growth of 
crops or lower the profits of farming or mar the ap- 
pearance of the landscape. 

In a sense farming is a continual warfare against 
these intruders, the contending forces being man and 
crops on the one side and weeds on the other, with nature 
a neutral onlooker, but one ever ready to lend her aid to 
the side showing the greatest persistence. Most of our 
important farm crops have largely lost the power to 
compete with weeds. They have been so altered from 
their original wild state by man that were they left to 
themselves they would become extinct in a few years. 
Our cropping methods must therefore be intelligently 
directed if the fight for the . profitable possession of the 
land is not to be lost. 

There is no easy road to weed control. Nevertheless 
a knowledge of the habits of weeds and the needs of 
cultivated crops places a man in an enlightened position 
in the struggle. It remains only for him to create condi- 
tions unfavorable to the one and favorable to the other. 
Intelligent direction is much to be preferred over ill- 
planned hard work. The chief difficulty is encountered 
on old farms where the sins of the preceding generation 

211 



212 DRY FARMING 

of farmers are being visited on the present occupants of 
the land. Under these conditions it is generally a 'dif- 
ficult problem to control weeds and at the same time 
make a profit from the farming operations. 

168. Why Weeds are Harmful.— 

(1) Weeds dissipate soil moisture (approximately 

500 lbs. for every lb. of dry matter they produce). 

(2) They use plant food that otherwise might go to the 

production of crops. 

(3) They lower the yield of crops by crowding and 

shading. 

(4) They lower the value of grain by causing it to be 

"docked" or to grade "rejected". 

(5) They render seed unfit for sowing or cause extra 

expense in cleaning for seed purposes. 

(6) They increase the cost of tillage, twine, stooking, 

threshing and freight. 

(7) They lower the value of the farm. 

(8) Some weeds are poisonous. 

169. Some Good Points About Weeds.— Yet weeds are 
not always harmful nor even useless. The weeds that grow 
on fallowed land pAmp tons of moisture from it, but 
when they are plowed under they add organic matter 
to the soil. This is seldom a sufficient excuse for weeds 
in dry areas, even though the backward farmer may 
find some consolation in the fact. The moisture saved 
through the prevention of weeds growing on a fallow is 
generally of more value to the soil than the organic 
matter the weeds would produce. Nevertheless, the 
plowing under of weeds increases the ultimate producing 
power of the land, and on soils that need organic matter 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 213 

the practice is not an unmixed evil. Weeds also, under 
some conditions, reduce the loss of nitrates from the 
soil. 

On some of our heavy soils in older districts where 
wheat lodges or ripens late, French weed or stinkweed 
is frequently very prevalent. No farmer there will say 
he prefers an infested to a clean farm, but many a 
wheat grower because of the fact that this weed in a 
fallow crop results in earlier maturity and in less 
lodging of the grain, eases his conscience by considering 
only its advantages. Such men are usually better phil- 
osophers than farmers. Yet there are many people who 
believe that the weed menace is a blessing in disguise 
compelling as it does considerable tillage to keep it in 
control. Whether one believes in this strange doctrine 
or not the bald facts remain that farms do become 
weedy, and that farmers must control weeds if they are 
to make a living. 

170. Principles of Weed Control. — Weeds spread by 
means of seeds or by creeping root stalks or by both, but 
in no other way. Weeds that spread by seeds can be 
controlled by preventing seed formation. Weeds that 
spread by creeping root stalks can be controlled by (1) 
preventing seed formation, and (2) killing the plants 
already establisihed in the soil. But a man gets weeds 
from outside his farm as well as from his own land. 
Hence, if his plans are to be efficient, he must also take 
steps to prevent the introdtetion of weedb to his farm 
from elsewhere. 

The prindiples of weed control may then be stated 
simply as follows : — 

1st. Prevent the weeds from dtevelopinig seedte. 
2nd. Kill the perennial weeds. 



214 



DRY FARMING 



3rd. Prevent the introduction of weed seeds. 
There are many different ways of putting these prin- 
ciples into practice but in the business of farming the 
cheapest and most efficient methods are the best. 

. Under . differ- 
ent soil and cli- 
matic conditions 
and with differ- 
ent weeds, dif- 
ferent practices 
halve naturally 
developed. The 
rellatJive suita- 
bility of each 
method to any 
given farm or 
district mxist be 
determined by 
the man on the 
ground and his 
judgement will 
be more reliable 
if he is inform- 
ed on (1) the 
appearence of 
noxious weeds and their seeds, (2) tlie habits of 
growth of the common weeds and how each spreads and 
(3) the most successful methods of comlbating eadh type 
of. weed.

cation of these may, however, be found in one or more of

172, Duration of the Growth of Weeds. — The duration 
of growth of different classes of weeds varies consider- 
ably, some completing their life cycle in one season, 
some in two or parts of two, while others live three 
years or more.' Thus we have annual, biennial, winter 
annual, and perennial weeds, each type requiring a dif- 
ferent treatment for its control or eradication. An- 
nuals die at the end of the first season's growth, winter 
annuals start in the late summer or early fall and die 
the next year, biennials die at the end of the second 
year, while perennials may live an indefinite number of 
years. 

Annuals, winter annuals and biennials can be com- 
pletely controlled by preventing seed formation and the 
introduction of weed seeds to the farm, but to control 
perennials not only must seed formation and the intro- 



216 DRY FARMING 

duction of seeds be prevented but the plants already 
established must be killed. In the second column of the 
tables in Sec. 174 the classification of our worst weeds 
according to duration is indicated. 

173. Habits of Root Growth and Time of Seeding.— 
In addition to knowing the "duration of growth" of 
weeds, it is essential also to know the habit of root 
growth of each, because on this point depends very 
largely the nature of the means of eradication. 

There are three more or less distinct forms of roots, 
(1) fibrous roots, (2) tap roots and (3) the so-called 
"creeping roots" or underground stems. Annual weeds 
usually have fibrous or tap roots, biennials generally 
have tap roots while perennial weeds may have fibrous, 
tap or creeping roots. The following are typical weeds 
of each of these types: 

Fibrous rooted annual . . . Wild Oats. 

Tap rooted annual Lamb's Quarters and Most 

Mustards. 
Tap rooted biennial Tansy Mustard and . Blue 

Burr. 
Fibrous rooted perennial . Wild Barley. 
Tap rooted perennial .... Curled Dock. 
Creeping rooted perennial. Canada Thistle, Sow 

Thistle, Quack Grass. 

The creeping rooted perennials are the most difficult 
to kill because of the fact that from each joint of the 
so-called "roof there may be sent up new plants even 
after tiie parent stem has been plowed down, 

174. How Weeds Spread. — Nature is the chief agency 
in the spread of weeds but man is largely responsible 
for the present condition of our cultivated fields. 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 217 

Among the influences by which man aids weed distribu- 
tion are (1) importing weedy foodstuffs including hay, 
(2) sowing impure seed, (3) neglecting road allowances 
and railway rights-of-way and freight yards, (4) using 
weed-infested, undeeayed farm yard manure, (5) cus- 
tom threshing, and (6) by tillage machinery in moving 
from dirty roads or fields to clean fields. 




Fig. 77. — Tumbling Mustard Piling Up Against a Fence. 
The Russian Thistle, another weed of tumbling habit is a serious 
menace to farmers in South Western Manitoba, South Western Saskat- 
chewan and Southern Alberta. 

The chief natural agencies resulting in the distribu- 
tion of weeds are the wind, water, animals and birds. 
The wind scatters (a) fluffy or hairy seeds such as 
Dandelion, Canada thistle and Sow thistle, (b) winged 
seeds such as Dock and Parsnip, (c) seeds having ex- 
tended edges such as Penny Cress, (d) plants that roll 
like Russian thistle and Tumbling mustard, (e) sticky 
seeds like Plantain adhering to weeds that blow, and 
(f) weed seeds in drifting soils. Irrigation water, 
flood streams, and rapid "run off" water also distribute 



218 DRY FARMING 

many seeds. Barbed seeds such as Burdock and Blue 
Burr, attach themselves to animals and are thus dis- 
tributed in the same way. In undecayed manure many 
undigested seeds are spread around and many small 
seeds are dispersed by dirt on the feet of birds. 

The tables on the following pages give the duration 
of growth, time of ripening, brief note on 1,he flower, 
and the method of spreading, of each of our common 
weeds.

222 DRY FARMING 

175. How to Prevent Weeds from Developing Seeds. — 
A knowledge of the appearance of the different weeds, 
their duration, habits of growth and means of spreading, 
enables a man to outline intelligently the practices he 
should employ in controlling them, under the particular 
soil and climatic conditions that exist where he lives. 
He will seldom use all of the means available to accom- 
plish the end he desires but only such of the methods as 
best fit into his system of farming. 

Among the chief means that are now followed on 
western farms for preventing weeds from developing 
seeds are; 

1. Fallowing, to get the seeds in the soil germinated 
and the seedlings killed, 

2. "Duckfooting" the fallow in late fall if biennials 
are growing on it, 

3. Late spring cultivation after weeds have started, 
and before early .maturing crops are sown, 

4. Sowing annual hay crops such as oats or beardless 
barley, to be cut before weed seeds mature, 

5. Using early maturing grain crops such as Winter 
rye and Early Six barley, which ripen before 
many of the weed seeds, 

6. Harrowing growing crops of grain after they are 
up to kill the small weeds that may be starting, 

7. Early fall cultivation of stubble land to encourage 
germination of seeds, which may then be destroyed 
by the low temperature of winter, 

8. Plowing stubble land in fall or spring if biennial 
weeds are prevalent, 

9. Sowing perennial hay crops which (1) smother 
many weeds, and (2) are cut before most weed 
seeds mature, 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 



223 



10. Mowing weeds on roads around fences and in 
waste places before seeds develop on them. 
176. How to Kill Perennial Weeds. — Some of our 
perennial weeds are the most difficult of all to control, 

while some are 
quite easily 
eradicated. The 
tap or fibrous 
rooted perenni- 
als can be killed 
by deep plowing 
and careful cov- 
ering of all vege- 
tation, followed 
by surface culti- 
V a t i n. The 
creeping - rooted 
ones are not so 
easily dealt 
with. One plow- 
ing is seldom 
sufficient to kill 
them and fre- 
quently several 
plowings do not 
succeed in doing 
so. Three of the 
common meth- 
ods employed 'in controlling the creeping-rooted peren- 
nials are as follow: — 

1. Shallow plowing in the fall and deep plowing the 
next summer after the weeds have made a fresh 
start. The first plowing followed by the cold win-

A typical tap-rooted winter annual or biennial. 



224 DRY FARMING 

ter gives the plants a set-back and the deep plow- 
ing when they have not entirely recovered, gives 
them another. Surface cultivation as needed may 
then be given to prevent green leaves forming on 
any that may remain. This plan, or some modifica- 
tion of it, is generally used for the Perennial Sow 
Thistle. 

2. Deep plowing as soon as the weather turns warm in 
May, then sowing thickly to a leafy crop like oats 
or barley. This often gives very satisfactory re- 
sults with Quack Grass. 

3. Mowing and removing the weeds just after blos- 
soming when they are least able to stand a check, 
then deep plowing followed by deep, thorough and 
frequent cultivation to keep the land black. This 
is frequently used for the control of Canada 
Thistle. 

177. How to Prevent the Introduction of Weeds to the 
Farm. — ^With the exception of a few native weeds all 
those now on our farms have grown from seeds that 
were introduced to it by human or other agencies. The 
prevention of weeds coming to the farm is the big prob- 
lem of men on virgin soils, and not an unimportant 
problem for all other farmers. Among the means of 
prevention are : 

1. Using only clean seed — unclean seed is chiefly res- 
ponsible for the weed evil. 

2. Buying only such feed grain as is free from Wild 
Oats, Mustard and other weed seeds, and such 
forage grasses as are free from Canada and Peren- 
nial Sow Thistles. 

3. Controlling soil drifting. A man cannot, of course, 
farm his neighbor's land and he cannot keep the 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 225 

weed seeds from blowing about. Co-operative com- 
munity effort as well as better farming must be 
enlisted in the fight against weeds. 

4. Cleaning the grain separator before it comes on 
the farm — the thresherman may resent this prac- 
tice, but the farmer will suffer if it is not carried 
out. 

5. Preventing stray animals roaming over the land — 
the dissemination of seeds in the manure of wan- 
dering stock is of common occurrence. 

6. Preventing the roadside weeds going to seed — this 
may be the business of the community, but it is 
sure to be the individual farmer's loss if not looked 
after. 

7. The intelligent enforcement of weed control legis- 
lation — laws do not kill weeds but they give power 
to communities to protect themselves from careless 
land owners and operators. 

178. Means at Man's Disposal for Controlling Weeds. — • 
The chief means at our disposal for controlling weeds 
already in the soil are tillage, crop rotations, smothering, 
hand pulling, pasturing and the use of chemicals. 

Tillage. — In so far as controlling weeds is a function 
of fallowing it is accomplished by tilling the latter in' 
such a way as (1) to germinate the weed seeds present, 
(2) to kill the weeds that grow and (3) if not successful 
in the latter, to prevent the weeds forming seeds. 

The use of hoed or intertilled crops enables one, at 
some expense, to germinate seeds and to kill many weeds 
without leaving the land idle. 

By plowing in fall or spring every year, biennials can 
be controlled absolutely and perennials can at least be 
kept in check. By disking early in the fall, annuals can 



226 DRY FARMING 

be lessened but not entirely controlled. By using the 
duck-foot cultivator small weeds of all types can be 
killed. By harrowing, young weeds can often be les- 
sened at a very low cost whether they appear in the 
fallow or growing crop. 

Digging by hand is not a popular method of weed 
control but when Canada or Sow Thistle are first ob- 
served in small patches they should be "eradicated" by 
hand if the area is too small to cultivate satisfactorily 
with machinery. 

Crop Rotations. — If we had good crop rotations we 
could control our weeds at a small fraction of the present 
cost. In considering this question four important facts 
should be kept in mind: 

1. Perennial hay crops will control weeds having short- 
lived seeds, such as Wild Oats, providing the in- 
troduction of other Wild Oats seeds is prevented. 

2. An occasional fallow encourages germination of 
weed seeds in the soil and permits killing the 
young plants shortly after they begin to grow. 

3. Intertilled crops will lessen the necessity for fal- 
lowing to kill weeds but may not prove profitable 
on a large acreage under present economic condi- 
tions, 

4. The use of early maturing crops that may be har- 
vested before weeds ripen enables one to prevent 
seed development. Among these early crops are 
(1) grain crops to be cut for forage, (2) Winter 
rye and, (3) early barley. 

Chemical Sprays. — A twenty per cent, solution of Iron 
Sulphate (100 pounds to 50 gallons of water per acre), 
applied on bright sunny days td mustard coming into 
bloom, will prevent inuch of it developing. Another 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 



227 



.solution used is a two per cent, solution of Copper Sul- 
phate (10 pounds to 50 gallons of water per acre). 
These chemicals may be applied with either a hand or 
power sprayer. Some men claim that Iron Sulphate 
solution will kill all Mustards, Cow Cockle, Dandelion, 
Canada Thistle, 
Bindweed, Plan- 
tain, Ragweed 
and some other 
weeds ; other in- 
vestigators are 
much less opti- 
mistic regarding 
the efficacy of 
chemical sprays. 
In any case the 
'practice of 
s p r a y in g for 
weed control is 
expensive and 
has not yet 
therefore come 
into general use. 

Pasturing. — 

When pasture is short, sheep aid in controlling Mustard, 
Plantain, Thistles, Lamb's Quarters, Shepherd's Purse 
and many other weeds but they seldom touch Stinkweed 
or Blue Burr. 

Smothering. — Leafy crops on spring plowing aid in 
the control of Quack Grass by smothering. It is a fact 
also that many young weed plants are prevented from 
developing by the crowding and shading of a good stand 
of any crop. This is why we find so many weeds where

lawns and waste places in Manitoba. 



228 DRY FARMING 

the drill has missed a strip and so few relatively where 
no skips in seeding occur. This fact is of great signifi- 
cance and should be appreciated by every grain grower. 
If we can succeed in giving our crops a good "start", 
particularly after having given the weeds a "set-back", 
our problem will have been made much easier; and a 
good even stand of grain with no skips or misses is 
important for the same reason. 

Tar paper is sometimes used to smother Canada or 
Sow Thistle when found in small patches. 

Hand Pulling. — Hand pulling weeds is expensive and 
with labor at present prices is impracticable except on 
small areas such as the seed plot, or as a preventive, 
measure on relatively clean land. Where only a few 
weeds are present in a field "an ounce of prevention" 
is worth many pounds of "cure", and roguing a field 
may be much less expensive than leaving the weeds to 
multiply and to add to the difficulties of future crop 
production, 

179, The Control of Annual Weeds.— The wild oat is 
a typical annual weed, and incidentally, one of tlie 
worst we have. 

The first and most important measure of control is to 
stop sowing them, a measure that is easy to plan but 
difficult to put into practice. 

The second is to prevent their introduction to the 
farm in feed, in threshing machines, by wandering stock, 
etc. 

The third is to prevent them from going to seed by 
(a) double disking or plowing shallow early in the fall 
so as to encourage germination and subsequent death by 
freezing, (b) killing as many as possible in the fallow 
year by disking after the first growth starts in the 



I 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 



229 



spring and plowing after the second growth starts, (c) 
growing a crop that may be harvested before the Wild 
Oats mature. 

The above practices may be followed on any grain 
farm with no serious alteration of cropping plans and 
no lessening of the acreage sown. If the weeds are so

prevalent that these measures are insufficient several 
others may be followed. Winter rye may be sown on 
the fallow to smother the oats the following year; or if 
the stand of rye is thinned out and wild oats grow, the 
crop may be cut for hay before the oats ripen. Early 
barley may be sown in the spring after a crop of wild 
oats has been killed by thorough disking or shallow plow- 
ing; and the barley may be cut for hay if the weeds 
develop, or left for grain if they do not. Early fall 
cultivation after this crop, providing there is sufficient 
moisture, will start many of the oats still left in the soil. 
A corn crop or a potato crop may be used instead of the 



230 DRY FARMK^G 

rye or barley and with better results. If these measures 
do not result in more or less complete eradication, tame 
grasses should be sown and left down two years or more, 
and a year taken to break up the land before the next 
crop is put in. 

The annual mustards and all other plants of similar 
habit may be controlled by the practices outlined for 
Wild Oats. Harrowing the growing crop after it is up, 
a practice that will not kill Wild Oats, is an additional 
means of killing the smaller seedlings of these annual 
plants. On account of the long time the hard seeds of 
many of these weeds may live in the soil, the use of 
perennial crops has not proven as useful a means of 
control as in the case of Wild Oats. 

180. The Control of Winter Annual and Biennial Weeds. 
— Most of the so-called winter annuals, of which Tum- 
bling Mustard and Stinkweed are typical examples, 
may develop as annuals if they happen to get a start 
early enough in the season. If they start in the spring 
they may be prevented from seeding by the practices 
suggested for controlling annual weeds. Those that 
start in the fall and those of the earlier plants that 
have not produced seed may be killed by the treatment 
outlined in the next paragraph for biennials. 

Blue Burr and Tansy Mustard are typical biennial 
weeds. If clean seed is always sown, and if seeds of 
Tansy Mustard are kept from blowing in, and those of 
Blue Burr from being carried in by stock or otherwise, 
these weeds can be controlled by late fall or early spring 
cultivation of all fields whether fallow or stubble. Fall 
or spring plowing of stubble fields is to be preferred. 
Disking will kill the young plants only if the discs are 
sharp and the soil firm. Thorough cultivation of the 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 231 

fallow late in the fall with a "duckfoot" cultivator will 
kill most of the winter annual and biennial weeds that 
have started. 

When dealing with either biennials or winter annuals 
it should be kept in mind, (1) that late fall cultivation

what similar in habit is more difficult to control in the Red River Valley. 

is essential whether early cultivation has been given or 
not, and (2) that the use of biennial crops like Winter 
rye and sweet clover which aid in the control of annual 
weeds, only foster the development and spread of bien- 
nial weeds. 

In some seasons some biennial weeds will germinate, 
and like annuals, produce seed in the same year. Fall 
cultivation will not control these. The usual cultivation 
given to control other annual weeds will, however, take 
care of them. 

181. The Control of Perennial Weeds. — The native 
quack grass (Agropyron glaucum), is a typical peren- 
nial wefed in many parts of the West. It is less difficult 



232 ' DRY FARMING 

to control than the eastern species {Agropyron repens). 
The chief methods of combating it in breaking are : — 

1. Plowing all the land and leaving no skips or misses. 

2. Plowing shallow early in June and plowing again 
deep late in the summer. 

3. On less "grassy" land in more dry areas, and par- 
ticularly in dry seasons, deep breaking followed by 
timely and sufficient surface cultivation may kill 
the native Quack but seldom kills the Sweet grass so 
frequently found in low moist places. 

The chief means of controlling Quack or other creep- 
ing rooted grasses in stubble fields, are : — 

1. Plowing in the fall — a "dry" time. 

2. Plowing in spring and seeding at once to a leafy 
crop such as oats or barley. 

When present in the fallow, Quack grass may be con- 
trolled by, — 

1. Plowing and digging out the roots with a spring 
tooth cultivator — always costly and not always an 
efficient method, but sometimes advisable and neces- 
sary. 

2. Plowing twice, preferably shallow in the fall and 
deep in the late June or early July following. 

Rose bushes can be controlled in much the same ways 
but when backsetting, or plowing stubble, or plowing 
fallow the second time, deeper work is necessary and 
more deep surface cultivation is desirable. 

The Canada Thistle and Perennial Sow thistles in 
stubble are also very difficult to control. In addition to 
the practices suggested above for Quack grass, frequent 
and thorough surface cultivation with cultivators having 
sharp cutting blades is desirable. After giving the 
plants as serious a set back as possible by deep plowing. 



WEEDS AND THEIR CONTROL 233 

one should endeavor to prevent the appearance of any- 
young thistles above ground. This requires frequent 
thorough cultivation, but, given favorable weather, will 
result in the gradual death of the creeping root stocks 
by starvation, because they cannot be nourished if green 
leaves are prevented from forming. A "green" fallow 
may be advisable occasionally throughout the fallow year 
for controlling wild oats but a "black" fallow is essential 
for the control of perennial weeds. If a field is infested 
with wild oats and perennial sow thistle the fallow should 
be planned to kill the most prevalent weed since the two 
cannot be satisfactorily eradicated the same year. 

182. Poisonous or Otherwise Injurious Weeds. — Poison- 
ous weeds are seldom found growing on cultivated fields. 
They are usually found in native pastures or low uncul- 
tivated areas where tillage is never given. The most 
commonly found poisonous plants are Water Hemlock, 
Dwarf Larkspur, Tall Mountain Larkspur, Purple 
Larkspur, Small Larkspur, Woolly Loco Weed, White 
Loco Weed, Poison Ivy, Lupines, Death Coma, Night 
Shade, Corn Cockle and Cow Cockle. The Crocus or 
Prairie Anemone is not poisonous but sometimes results 
in the death of sheep by the formation in the stomach of 
balls of the hairs that grow so profusely on the stems. 
Spear grass is sometimes injurious to sheep for a time 
when the "spears" are being shed, and to other animals 
when fed in hay, by the spears penetrating the flesh. 



CHAPTER XIII 
IRRIGATION FARMING IN WESTERN CANADA 

By W. H. Fairfield, 

Superintendent, Experimental Farm, Lethhridge, 
Alberta. 

The application of water to the land by artificial 
means for the production of crops is a very ancient 
practice. Authentic records indicate that irrigation 
was used in Egypt over five thousand years ago, and in 
China and India at least as early. Even in North and 
South America remains of ancient irrigation ditches of 
great length have been found. "The development of 
irrigation from the time when man first watered his 
crop with a bucket, then a doon, next a paddle wheel 
and finally the gravity system giving water to enormous 
areas, is one of the wonders and proofs of the advance 
of civilization." 

It is estimated that at present nearly two hundred 
million acres of land are irrigated, by far the larger 
part of which is in India, China and Japan, although 
large projects are found in United States, Egypt, Aus- 
tralia and Canada. 

183. History of Irrigation in Western Canada. — In the 
early nineties, some years after completion of the main 
line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, preliminary sur- 

234 



IRRIGATION FARMING 235 

veys were inaugurated by the Government to determine 
the feasibility of diverting water from some of the 
mountain streams for irrigating a portion of the prairie 
land of southern Alberta. The first project of any 
magnitude was built by the Canadian North West Irri- 
gation Company, now owned and operated by the Can- 




Fig. 82. — Float LeveUlng Land for the Border System of Irrigation. 

adian Pacific Railway Company, in the vicinity of Leth- 
bridge where approximately 130,000 acres of land have 
been brought "under the ditch". Water was first carried 
by this ditch in the fall of 1900. Five or six years later 
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company inaugurated an 
irrigation project east of Calgary, diverting water from 
the Bow River, to irrigate, approximately, 880,000 acres 
in their block of 3,000,000 acres of land extending from 
west of Strathmore to east of Brooks. 

Previous to this time there were a number of small 
projects taken out by private individuals, the greater 
number of these being in the southwestern part of Sas- 



236 DRY FARMING 

katchewan, in the vicinity of the Cypress Hills, where the 
water is used almost exclusively for the irrigation of hay 
lands. 

184. Methods of Irrigation.— There are various 
methods of applying water to the crops. The one best 
suited to a particular locality, or a particular crop, de- 
pends upon a number of factors. Among these might be 
mentioned (1) the nature of the surface of the land, 
whether it has a steep slope or is fairly level, (2) the 
character of the soil, and (3) the kind of crop grown, in- 
cluding the value of the crop, the latter determining how 
much expense might Idc warranted for the construction 
of the system. Among the methods used are (1) Wild 
Flooding, (2) the Furrow System, .(3) the Bedding 
System, (4) the "Check" System, (5) the Border Sys- 
tem, and (6) Sub-irrigation. 

185. Wild Flooding. — This is the earliest and crudest 
system known. By it the water is diverted from rapidly 
flowing streams by plow furrows or small cheaply con- 
structed ditches and so spread over the bottom lands 
adjacent to the stream, the idea being either to increase 
the yield of native hay or to insure a crop of small 
grains. The water is taken out of the ditches at con- 
venient points and allowed to run practically at will 
until it reaches the lower ground, or possibly goes back 
into the stream again. 

186. The Furrow System. — This is used where the land 
has a steep slope, and often where the supply of water is 
limited. It is also employed in the irrigation of garden 
truck and all crops grown in rows. For the irrigation 
of grain crops with this system, shallow furrows three or 
four feet apart are made on the land after the crop is 
sown but before it comes up. The water is allowed to 



IKllIGATION FARMING 237 

trickle down these furrows in such small amounts that 
Avashing of the soil does not take place and is allowed to 
run long enough so that the soil between the furrows is 
thoroughly wet. This method is not used on the prairies 
in Western Canada with grain or hay. 

187. The Bedding System. — This is a method employed 
on land which has little fall. The banks or dykes are 




Fig. 83. — Making Borders for Border System of Irrigation. 

raised so that the areas enclosed, from a fraction of an 
acre to an acre or more, are all covered with w-ater. This 
is then drained into the next bed lower down. 

188. The "Check" System is a form of bed irrigation 
and is used quite extensively on hay lands in the Cypress 
Hills district. The method followed is to dam the stream 
by building a dyke across the valley. By this method 
the water, especially during the spring freshets, is 
checked and forced back over the creek bottoms. The 
dykes are placed at different intervals, depending upon 
the fall of the stream, so that the bottom land may be 
completely submerged while there is sufficient water in

the stream to allow this to be done. Proper sluice gates 
are, of course, installed in these dykes,

on. )The field (before seeding) is laid out in strips, two 
or three or four rods wide, up and down the slope of the 
land. Separating these strips, ridges six to eight inches 
high are thrown up. They are so arranged that where 
water is turned into one of these strips it will spread 
out evenly between the ridges and irrigate the whole 
length of the strip uniformly with less labor than is 
usually required with the ordinary flooding method. The 
entire field, ridges and all, are seeded. ] 



IRRIGATION FARMING 239 

190. Sub-Irrigation, or upward irrigation is sometimes 
used where a very intensive scheme is inaugurated. This 
is done by the use of tiles laid in the ground just deep 
enough so that they will not be struck by the plow. 
These are kept full of water which percolates upwards 
and sideways from the openings at the ends of the 
tiles. This is not used on the prairies nor is it apt to be, 
for, although it has some advantages, the extremely high 
expense of installation makes it prohibitive. 

191. Relative Suitability of Various Crops under Irri- 
gation. — -Owing to the fact that our climate is sub-humid 
or semi-arid rather than arid it is not necessary to irri- 
gate all kinds of crops every season to obtain profitable 
returns. In this connection the hay crops are an ex- 
ception since they rarely if ever produce abundantly in 
the dry parts without irrigation and they always re- 
spond favorably to the use of water. There is an old 
adage that comes from northern Italy where irrigation 
has been practised for several centuries, which says, 
"The more water the more hay". This is certainly true 
in the drier parts of Western Canada with grasses and, 
with slight modifications, with alfalfa, potatoes and 
truck crops. Alfalfa is the most promising irrigation 
crop. Timothy also does exceptionally well 'HDelow the 
ditch.'^ The grain crops are somewhat less suited 
to irrigation in this climate, but respond well to the 
timely application of water. 

192. Irrigating Timothy and Native Grasses. — The 
management of these crops is perhaps less difficult than 
that of any others now grown under irrigation in Western 
Canada. The profit depends solely upon an adequate 
supply of water evenly applied to the fields from the 
time growth starts in the spring, which is early in May, 



240 



DRY FARMING 



up to the latter part of June. The amount of water 
that may be applied to grasses is greater than for any- 
other crops that are raised. The land selected for the 
growing of such hay should be reasonably level and 
should not have too great a slope. In other words, con- 
ditions must be such that water can be easily and often 




Fig. 85. — Irrigator at Work. 



applied and at not too great expense for labor. It is 
necessary if the best results are to be obtained that the 
surface of the soil should never be allowed to dry out. 
With the grasses a cool, moist condition at the surface 
is essential for maximum returns. It is also important 
that the field be given a thorough soaking in- the fall so 
that the grass may grow vigorously in the spring even 
before the irrigation water is applied. 

In the preparation of land for timothy some excellent 
results have been obtained in certain localities where the 
native sod has not been broken but the surface disked 
and the seed sown. The seed usually germinates on the 



IRRIGATION FARMING 241 

application of water and the young plants grow vigor- 
ously if the surface of the soil is kept moist. The re- 
sulting hay is a mixture of native grass (principally 
Blue Joint) and timothy which makes an excellent for- 
age, more nutritious and more palatable to stock than 
timothy alone. 

193. Alfalfa under Irrigation. — Among all crops that 
are now raised under irrigation in the West none is so 
well adapted to this type of farming as alfalfa. The 
preparation of the land for this crop should be the same 
as when it is raised under dry land conditions except 
that a greater amount of seed should be used. From 
fifteen to eighteen pounds of seed is generally recom- 
mended. The thicker the stand obtained the greater the 
yield and the finer and better the quality of the hay will 
be. In all cases seed grown in Western Canada is to be 
preferred. In localities where winter killing is common 
only extremely hardy strains such as Grimm or Baltic 
should be used. 

The irrigation of alfalfa is somewhat different from 
that of the grasses in that the field should be irrigated 
and thoroughly soaked as rapidly as possible and then 
the surface allowed to dry so that the soil can warm up. 
In the Lethbridge district, where the largest acreage of 
alfalfa in the West is now grown, it is not always neces- 
sary to irrigate for the first cutting but it is usually 
advisable. The common practice is to take two cuttings 
but three cuttings may be obtained in ordinary seasons 
by taking the first cutting about the 15th or 20th of 
June instead of from one to two weeks later. As soon as 
each crop is removed from the land the field should be 
immediately irrigated, i.e., there should be an irrigation 
for each cutting. Fall irrigation for alfalfa has been 



242 



DRY FARMING 



found as a rule to be a good practice, although in a few 
places where the land is extremely heavy late fall irri- 
gation is of somewhat doubtful value. 

194. Grain Crops. — There has been some contention as 
to the advisability of irrigating growing grain in certain 
localities where the season is short, and the grain slow in 




Fig. 86. — Irrigating Wheat, Strathmore, Alta. 

ripening, on account of danger from frost in the fall. In 
such localities this difficulty can be overcome by irri- 
gating the land in the fall after the growing season is 
over. This is a commendable practice under all circum- 
stances. But in dry seasons even when the land has 
been irrigated the fall previous, the growing crop must 
be irrigated again if maximum yields are to be obtained. 
In most districts where irrigation is now practised grow- 
ing grain can be irrigated quite safely, and certainly ad- 
vantageously, providing the water is applied before the 
crop has suffered materially from drought. The secret 
of raising grain successfully under irrigation is pre- 
paredness. The period in which water can be applied to 



IRRIGATION FARMING 243 

a particular kind of grain to obtain the best results is 
limited to less than three weeks, consequently a man with 
a large acreage of grain must have his ditches made, and 
be prepared to apply the water expeditiously, as soon as 
the time arrives when he thinks it is wise to apply it. It 
is better not to put water on a grain crop till the 
stooling process has been completed, otherwise the ap- 
plication of water might affect the development of the 
crop at this point. As a rule one irrigation is all that is 
required, but in extremely dry seasons a second irriga- 
tion is necessary, if the best results are to be obtained. 
The method used is to flood irrigate from laterals put in 
at from forty to seventy yards apart in the field. These 
may be run lengthwise of the ridges or "hogbacks", or 
contour ditches may be put in at right angles to the fall 
of the land. The latter plan is usually preferable. It 
is better to have the ditches too close together than too 
far apart. 

195. Potatoes. — It requires more skill and experience 
to raise potatoes successfully under irrigation than any 
other crop commonly grown. The secret appears to lie in 
being able to keep the plants growing vigorously from 
the beginning with no setbacks, and on the other hand 
in being able to apply the water so that too sudden 
growth will not be stimulated at any time. The first 
irrigation should be very light, and it should not be given 
until the small potatoes are set and perliaps the size of 
peas. This stage is usually about the time the first blos- 
soms appear. If the crop is wet before this time there 
is danger of the plants setting more potatoes than they 
will be able to develop to a marketable size. To be sure 
that the potatoes are not wet too much when the first 
irrigation is given, it is well to run the water between 



244 DRY FARMING 

every alternate row only, and turn it off just as soon as 
it gets through so as not to let the ground soak up any 
more than is necessary. As soon as the ground dries suf- 
ficiently the land should be given a shallow cultivation. 




Fig. 87. — Furrow System of Irrigation. 

About ten days after the first irrigation, the second 
should be given. This time the water may be run down 
between all the rows and should be allowed to remain 
running until the land is well wetted. After irrigation 
has once begun, the land should never be allowed to dry 
up completely. Unless heavy showers intervene, it will 
be found necessary to irrigate about every ten days in 
order to maintain a moist condition. After each irriga- 
tion as soon as the surface of the soil dries sufficiently it 
should be given a shallow cultivation. If for any reason 
after irrigation has once begun the land is permitted to 
become quite dry the potatoes should not be irrigated 
again. If they are, a second growth is almost certain to 



IRRIGATION FARMING 



245 



be induced, and this will injure the quality. The main 
cause of soggy potatoes, when grown under irrigation, is 
allowing the land to become somewhat dry so that the 
growth is checked, and then applying water and in- 
ducing a fresh growth of roots and tops. 

196. Other Crops, Including Trees. — All garden truck, 
should be furrow irrigated with' sufficient cultivation be- 
tween irrigations to prevent the soil from crusting. 




Fig. 88. — ^Map Sbowing Location of Irrigation Projects Under Way or 

Projected. 

The dots indicate the number and location of small private irrigation 

schemes. 



Strawberries and small fruits such as currants and rasp- 
berries should be irrigated often during fruiting time to 
keep them growing in a vigorous manner during the time 
the fruit is forming and ripening. "With trees and 
shrubs generally the water should be applied liberally 
in the early part of the spring but should cease during 
the latter part of July and August so that the land may 



246 DRY FARMING 

have a chance to dry out and so induce the new suc- 
culent growth to harden up properly for the winter. 
This is an important point and one that is often over- 
looked. Trees that are ordinarily perfectly hardy are 
made tender and suffer from winter killing owing to the 
fact that rapid growth is maintained right up to the 
time hard frosts may be expected. After the leaves start 
to drop in the fall it is well to give the trees and shrubs 
a liberal soaking.

CHAPTER XIV 
THE CAUSES AND CONTROL OF LOW YIELDS 

197. The Causes of Low Yields. — The major causes of 
low yields in the West at the present time are climatic — 
drought, frost and high winds. The many minor causes 
are the cropping and soil management practices man em- 
ploys or fails to employ — in the operation of his farm. 

In the final analysis all low yields trace back to one 
or more of six fundamental things : — 

1. The purity or quality of the seed. 

2. The suitahility of the crop or the variety. 

3. The supply and availability of the plant food in 
the soil. 

4. The moisture in the soil. 

5. The temperature of the soil and air. 

6. The amount of air in the soil. 

But while this list includes the immediate or funda- 
mental causes of low yields, yet each of these is the direct 
result of certain other influences or practices to which is 
generally ascribed the cause of the decreased return. 
The former may be regarded as the immediate or funda- 
mental causes, the latter as the practical causes of partial 
or complete failure. 

The fundamental cause of low yield in a certain field 
may be lack of moisture. The practical cause may have 
been, poor fallowing, weeds, warm winds, low precipita- 

247 



248 DRY FARMING 

tion or any of the causes that go to diminish the moisture 
content of the soil. The fundamental cause of low 
yield in another field may be insufficient available plant 
food. The practical cause may have been an infertile 
soil, unsuitable tillage, continuous cropping with no 
return of plant food or any of the other causes that de- 
crease or leave undeveloped the plant food in the soil. 

In this chapter we shall discuss the practical causes of 
low yields because it is with these the grain grower is 
most familiar and it is these he usually advances to ex- 
plain why his crops are not satisfactory. Among these 
are: — 

198. Poor Seed. — Poor seed is seed that will either not 
germinate or will not grow vigorously, that contains dis 
ease or impurities or that belongs to a variety that is not 
suited to the district where it is to be grown. The vigor 
of growth and percentage of germination can be deter- 
mined by making a germination test. Its freedom from 
impurities including most forms of disease can be told by 
examining the seed or by its odor, but the presence of 
some diseases can only be detected in the field before the 
crop is harvested. The suitability of the variety to a 
district cannot be foretold by examining the seed. This 
point can only be determined from the experience of 
other farmers or from carefully conducted tests. 

The seed may be so inferior that it will produce no 
crop, it m'ay be so good that it will result in maximum 
returns or it may occupy any intermediate stage of per- 
fection. No intelligent farmer takes chances on his seed 
being the cause of decreased yield. This is one of the 
factors of prodiiction that lies wholly within the power 
of the farmer to control. 

199. Too Early or Too Late Seeding. — The best time to 



THE CAUSES OF LOW YIELDS 



249

sow is determined largely by the temperature conditions 
of spring and fall. When sown too early the seed may 
rot or the early growth freeze. If sown too late the crop 
may be injured by frost in the fall. Our grain crops are 
quite resistant to spring frosts but very susceptible to 
fall frosts. Corn and potatoes are very susceptible to 
spring frosts and suffer from the first fall frosts while 
roots and rape will stand very heavy fall frosts. The 
perennial grasses and alfalfa withstand both spring and 
fall frosts of considerable severity. As a rule all spring 
sown crops should be planted between April 10 and the 
end of June in the following order: — wheat, rye, peas, 
oats, barley, flax, roots, potatoes, sunflowers, corn and 
alfalfa. If no nurse crop is used grasses and clovers 
should be sown in June, otherwise they may be put in 
with spring sown nurse crops at an earlier date. 

200. Too Much or Too Little Seed per Acre. — The 
amount of grain to sow per acre is greatly influenced by 
the moisture and temperature conditions prevailing. A 
thin stand is desirable in dry areas having a medium to 
long growing season while a thick stand is preferable in 
humid regions, particularly where the growing season is 
short. It is hardly correct to say that thin seeding is 
always desirable in dry areas and thick seeding in 
humid areas for the reason that the condition of the soil 
with respect to moisture and tilth at seeding time largely 
determines the stand. Thin seeding on a perfect seed 
bed may give a good stand, while thick seeding on poorly 
prepared land may result in a thin stand. It should 
always be our aim to have a good seed bed and then sow 
thinly in dry areas and on d'ry soils and proportionately 
heavier in more moist regions and those having a shorter 
growing season. A thin stand will withstand drought 



THE CAUSES OP LOW YIELDS 



251 



better than a thick stand but a thick stand will ripen 
earlier than a thin stand. 

201. TTiisuitable Varieties. — Varieties of any of our 
common grain crops that from any cause, such as lateness, 
low quality, weak straw, or susceptibility to frost or dis- 
ease, are not well suited to our conditions, result either 
in low yields or in decreased prices. The standard vari- 
eties that are known to be suitable to the different parts 
of the West are as follows : —

New varieties are appearing from time to time and 
while the great majority of these are not equal to the 
claims made for them a few are quite sure to be superior 
to the old sorts. Nevertheless new settlers and inex- 
perienced Westerners should use only standard var- 
ieties. It is of course desirable that the testing of new 
varieties be encouraged on all different soil types and 
in all climatic zones of the country for the reason that 
the Experiment Stations are so few and so far apart 
that their conclusions regarding the suitability of 
varieties are not necessarily applicable to all parts. At 
the same time a large acreage of a new sort should never 
be sown until it has given positive evidence that it is as 
good or better than the standard ones used. 

202. Shattering. — After a grain or seed crop has 
started to mature a considerable loss often occurs as a 
result of shattering due either to winds or to the neces- 
sary handling at harvest time. This loss is greater in 
some classes of crops than in others and in some varieties 



THE CAUSES OF LOW YIELDS 



253 




a ^ 



m d 






254 DRY FARMING 

than in others. It is greatest in over-ripe crops and 
least in immature ones. The Durum or Macaroni wheats 
are our most non-shattering varieties. Marquis shatters 
less than any of our other commonly-grown sorts. Barley 
does not shatter seriously, but the heads break off easily 
after maturing.- Rye shatters very easily if let get too 
ripe. The seed of the grasses and sweet clover when al- 
lowed to mature also shatters freely. Early harvesting, 
careful handling, and the use of non-shattering classes 
or varieties, are about the only practices that will offset 
this possible loss. 

203. Late Breaking. — The results of experiments at 
Saskatoon during the last four years indicate that delay 
in breaking native prairie after the tenth of June de- 
creases the yield of wheat one bushel per acre per week, 
or what is more important, decreases the profit from 
$8.44 per acre on June 10th breaking to $3.81 on 
August breaking and $1.09 on breaking done in the 
month of September. It is impossible on a farm to do 
every job at the best time, but when the best time is 
known a man can so shape his plans that as much as 
possible of the work can be done when it should be done. 

These conclusions are probably applicable only to that 
portion of the open prairie lying between the 104th and 
110th meridians. In proportion as the average rain- 
fall of other areas is greater than that at Saskatoon, the 
breaking of the prairie land or the grass land may very 
profitably be delayed. In the most humid parts August 
breaking or even spring breaking may be cropped with 
some success. 

204. Seeding on Breaking Done the Same Season. — 
The newcomer naturally desires a crop as soon as pos- 
sible after taking up land. In the more humid parts a 



THE CAUSES OF LOW YIELDS 255 

fair crop on the average may be obtained by good break- 
ing done early enough to seed it about the last of May 
to an early-maturing crop. In the drier parts such a 
practice will only result in a profit about once in four 
years, the reason of the low return being the lack of 
moisture and available plant food in th« soil from the 
previous year. In the more moist parts oats, barley and 
potatoes are frequently grown on breaking done the same 
season, but the practice even in these areas is to be en- 
couraged only where the land can be well prepared by 
being broken not less than four inches deep, packed and 
disked and harrowed to form a good seed bed. 

Where the rainfall is low and the evaporation great 
sowing a grain crop on spring breaking is not a good 
practice. It not only is a losing proposition three times 
out of four, but the land so used is seldom in good con- 
dition for a subsequent crop, nor is it likely to give a 
good yield until it is summerf alio wed. In the dry parts 
flax is the crop generally used at present for sowing on 
breaking. Potatoes are sometimes grown on such land 
for home use, but such preparation is inadvisable for a 
large acreage of this crop. Oats also are occasionally 
grown on spring breaking for sheaf feed. Corn is seldom, 
used on spring breaking, but unlike the other crops 
mentioned it will do quite well and at the same time leave 
the land in far better condition for a subsequent crop 
than any of the others mentioned. 

205. Native Perennial Plants in Stubble Fields.— The 
long-lived perennial plants commonly found growing in 
prairie sod are often the chief causes of low yields in 
stubble fields. Quack grass, sweet grass and rose bushes 
are three widely spread members of this group. Such 
perennials are reproduced by creeping roots as well as 



256 DRY FARMING 

by seed and can be controlled only by plowing. Plow- 
ing in a dry time is more effective than plowing in a wet 
season. To kill these plants in prairie sod it is often 
necessary to plow twice, or to "break and backset". To 
kill them when present in stubble fields either of two 
methods may be used : (1) fall plow and leave loose over 
winter, or (2) spring plow and sow thickly at once to 
a leafy crop like oats or barley. If present in land to be 
fallowed two plowings are advisable — shallow in fall 
and deep the following summer or shallow in late spring 
and deeper in late summer. 

206. Plowing When the Soil is Too Wet or Too Dry.— 
When a soil is plow^ed when either too wet or too dry its 
physical condition may be seriously injured. The dam- 
age resulting from such a cause can seldom be remedied 
by tillage and is frequently not repaired by the weather- 
ing agencies until it is too late to get a good crop. It is 
true that many heavy soils when left in this condition 
"slake down" after rains and after the low tempera- 
tures and snows of winter ; but some do not, and often 
the rains and snows of winter are very scarce and fail 
to accomplish the leavening influence of normal or wet 
seasons. 

This injury is seldom serious on fallowed fields that 
are too wet or too dry when plowed for the reason that 
the weathering agencies have time to either partially or 
wholly repair the injury done by man in his untimely 
operations. Medium and light types of soil seldom suf- 
fer serious physical injury from this cause but heavy 
loams and clays frequently do. On some of the heavier 
soils in the drier parts fall plowing that is done when 
too dry turns up in chunks and dries out and often can- 
not be worked down well enough to give good results 



THE CAUSES OF LOW YIELDS 257 

the following year. The "stubbling in" of fields is 
generally an undesirable practice but its chief justifi- 
cation in the minds of manj^ farmers lies in the fact that 
there are times and conditions in some of our medium 
dry areas when land is put out of condition by fall plow- 
ing and, as a result, gives disappointing yields. 

For economic reasons man must plow when time per- 
mits and this may not be the best time. Nevertheless, 
the condition of the soil at different seasons of the year 
and in different years should be an important consider- 
ation, when planning the season's operations, 

207. Plowing Under Heavy Stubble or Coarse Manure. — 
These substances when plowed under add considerable 
organic matter to the soil but they do not decay rapidly 
in a dry climate and may therefore leave the soil so 
loose that the upward movement of moisture and the 
downward growth of plant roots is interfered with thus 
sometimes resulting in a decreased yield of the first crop 
after the application. This is one of our difficult 
problems. Continuous grain-growing dissipates organic 
matter; and coarse organic matter unless well inter- 
mixed with the soil and firmly packed down may injure 
the condition of the soil. 

When organic matter is badly needed as on the lighter 
types of soil and those that drift neither stubble nor 
manure should ever be burned, but when either is plow- 
ed under the land should be worked down to a firm 
condition. Manure should never be applied thickly for 
grain crops in the Prairie Provinces. Ten loads per 
acre on a forty-acre field is much to be preferred over 
twenty loads per acre on a twenty-acre field. 

208. Too Xate Plowing of the Fallow. — In tests con- 
ducted at Saskatoon the yield of wheat decreased at the 



258 



DRY FARMING 




THE CAUSES OF LOW YIELDS 259 

rate of approximately one bushel per acre for eaeli 
week's delay in plowing the fallow after the tenth of 
June. It was quite apparent that the longer the fallow 
was left unplowed after weed growth commenced the less 
moisture there was conserved and the less available 
plant food developed. 

On» very weedy soils it is generally advisable to get the 
weed seeds germinated before plowing the fallow. This 
often necessitatc^s a delay in plowing. In such cases the 
bad effects from delayed plowing will be lessened if the 
weeds and volunteer plants are kept down by some form 
of surface cultivation such as disking or cultivating. 
On soils that drift easily late plowing of the fallow may 
be advisable. (See "Objections to Fallowing" and "De- 
fense of Fallowing" in Chapter X). 

209. Weeds. — Space does not permit of more than a 
brief -reference to this point. The subject is, however, 
fully discussed in Chapter XII. At this time we shall re- 
fer only to the principles of weed control, the first of 
which is that annual weeds like wild oats and the com- 
mon mustards can be controlled by preventing them 
from seeding ; the second that biennials can be controlled 
by plowing the land every year ; the third that perennials 
can be controlled by preventing them from seeding and 
by killing the established plants by tillage; and the 
fourth that eradicating weeds is of little practical value 
if others are introduced to the farm and sown with the 
seed, or distributed in any other way. Dozens of sys- 
tems or combinations of practices are used and recom- 
mended for weed control. But all control methods trace 
back to one or more of these fundamental principles. 

210. Insects. — Insects do much less damage to our 
crops here than they do in milder climates. Yet we are 



260 DRY FARMING 

by no means free from their visitations. When any 
species is found to be increasing the methods of con- 
trol may take any one or more of three forms : — first, the 
prevention of its reproduction or its spread; second, its 
destruction by poisoning if it is a "biting" insect; and 
third, its destruction by chemicals that kill by contact 
if it belongs to the "sucking" insects. In some cases 
none of these plans of attack are successful and other 
means of destruction are necessary. The common insect 
pests of the West and their control are very ably and 
plainly discussed by Mr. Griddle in Chapter XIV^ of 
"Crop Production in Western Canada", and by other 
entomologists in bulletins that may be secured free of 
charge from the Dominion Department of Agriculture at 
Ottawa or from any of the Provincial t)epartments. 

211. Plant Diseases.— The most common diseases affect- 
ing grain crop's in Western Canajia are smut and rust. 
Flax wilt and certain fungous, bacterial and physio- 
logical diseases of potatoes and other crops also take an 
annual toll from the farmer's profit. Rust cannot be 
controlled but its ravages may be lessened by the use of 
rust resistant varieties as well as by all those cultural 
practices that result in earlier maturity. The eradica- 
tion of secondary hosts of the plant such as the barberry 
and buckthorn lessens the probability of the appearance 
of the disease. The grain smuts, except the loose smuts 
of wheat and barley, can be lessened or entirely pre- 
vented by the formalin treatment of the seed. The loose 
smuts referred to can be controlled by the hot water 
treatment of the seed. The physiological diseases can be 
largely prevented by the choice of suitable varieties and 
the use of healthy seed. The bacterial and fungous dis- 
eases can be controlled only by the use of disease-free 



THE CAUSES OF LOW YIELDS 261 

seed on a healthy soil or by chemical or physical treat- 
ment to destroy the bacteria or fungi present. 

212. Heavy Spring Frosts. — In Western Canada most 
of the grain crops must be sown before danger of spring 
frosts is past. The only means of lessening the damage 
from such late spring frosts as may come are, first, to 
have seed of strong vitality in order that the young 
plants may have the greatest possible chance to recover, 
and secondly to have the soil in the best possible condi- 
tion in order that the weakened plants may be well sup- 
ported in their efforts to recover. 

Damage may be prevented to some extent by some- 
what later seeding and by seeding the hardiest kinds 
first and the tenderest last. But with grain crops 
especially it is generally wise to risk the spring frosts 
rather than to sow late and run the danger of fall frosts. 
The latter do very great damage occasionally, but spring 
frosts seldom do serious harm to cereals except when ac- 
companied by a long period of dry weather or J)y soil 
drifting. If the tender crown is exposed by blowing the 
effect of spring frosts may be disastrous. 

In order of hardiness in spring the cereals rank as 
follows : — Rye, wheat, oats and barley. Flax is not less 
tender than oats or barley, but if frosted, does not re- 
cover so well on account of its habit of branching above 
ground. It is therefore not usually sown until after 
the cereals. Peas withstand spring frosts quite well but 
if injured recovery is much slower and less complete than 
with the grain crops. Corn and potatoes are very tender 
but potatoes will recover from frosts that kill corn. 

213. Hail Storms. — This is one of the factors affecting 
crops that man has no power to control. The only way 
in which he can play safe is by insuring his crop. It is 



262 DRY FARMING 

seldom that more than two or three per cent, of our crop 
is damaged by hail. It is true that the average man pays 
more in premiums than he gets out in awards for hail 
damage but it is equally true that many uninsured farm- 
ers have gone bankrupt ^ecause they could not stand the 
loss of a crop. 

The justification for insuring against hail is not in the 
probability of getting back more than is paid in, but 
rather of insuring one's self against serious incon- 
venience or even bankruptcy in case of loss of one or 
more crops. 

214. Hot Winds. — The hot winds that occasionally oc- 
cur in southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan 
increase very greatly both the evaporation of moisture 
from the soil and its transpiration from the leaves of 
plants. If the velocity of the wind could be economically 
lessened in any way, such as by using wind breaks, much 
damage could be prevented. In actual practice the only 
ways of lessening the amount of injury from this source 
are to store as much moisture as possible in the soil, to 
use drought-resistant or drought-avoiding crops and to 
follow as efficiently as possible the established practices 
of "dry farming". In the very warm parts of the driest 
areas the use of early maturing cereals such as winter 
rye offers much promise as a result of partial avoidance 
rather than resistance to hot winds. 

215. Dry Seasons. — The average precipitation in the 
West is about sixteen inches which is less than one-half 
of that received in the corn belt of the United States, or 
in Ontario, or in many parts of England. The monthly 
distribution of this precipitation is very favorable; 
nevertheless the low rainfall causes more low yields than 
any other factor at the present time. Since we cannot 



THE CAUSES OF LOW YIELDS 263 

control the climate it remains for us to conserve as much 
as possible of the limited moisture that falls. Every extra 
inch of moisture that can be stored and conserved in 
the soil means on an average a possible increase of two 
to four bushels of wheat per acre. (See Chapter X). 

216. Fall Frosts. — Low temperatures in early fall fre- 
quently work serious injury to all grain and other crops 
in the northern areas and occasionally also in other parts 
of the West. Our growing season is short and we cannot 
control the temperature of the atmosphere. We can 
lessen the damage from frost only by putting into use 
those practices that result in avoiding frost and by grow- 
ing crops that take little or no injury from low tempera- 
tures. Among these practices are: — (1) packing the 
land, (2) thick seeding, (3) using early classes of grain 
such as oats, barley or rye, (4) using early varieties of 
grain such as Prelude, Euby or Red Bobs wheat ; Sixty- 
day, Orloff or Daubeney oats; Early Six barley; Long 
Stem flax; and Early White peas, (5) less frequent fal- 
lowing, (6) shallower plowing for the fallow, (7) later 
plowing of the fallow, (8) pasturing the fallow, (9) early 
seeding, (10) the use of press drills, (11) growing frost 
resistant crops such as Western rye grass, brome grass, 
grain crops for hay and Swede turnips for succulent 
winter feed, and (12) going into mixed or stock farming. 
The first ten of these practices aid us in avoiding frost, 
the last two enable one to farm so that serious injury 
will not result from this cause. 



CHAPTER XV 

THE MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 

In Western Canada there are a number of soil types 
which differ from what may be considered normal soils. 
These generally require some special, treatment for best 
returns. Although most of these soils have not been 
studied scientifically it has been thought advisable to 
add a brief discussion of their peculiarities and the 
methods now followed by farmers in managing Drifting 
Soils, Alkaline Soils, Loose Top Soils, Burnt Out Soils, 
Poor Soils and Cold Soils, 

# 

Drifting Soils 

Soil erosion as a result of wind action is one of the 
most serious problems facing the farmer on some types 
of soil in the open plains region of the West. It is the 
first and most emphatic evidence of either poor soil, un- 
suitable tillage or soil deterioration. During the past 
three years it has been responsible for the partial or 
complete destruction of thousands of acres of crop in 
many different portions of the plains area. 

217. The Damage Caused by Soil Drifting is evidenced 
not only in injury to the crop that may be on the land 
but also to the soil itself. The seed may be uncovered or 
blown out of the ground and the young plants may be 

264 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 265 

killed by having their roots exposed, or by being covered 
by the drifting particles, or by abrasions resulting 
from the long continued impingement of the drifting 
particles against the tender tissues of the plant. Tlie 
soil itself is injured by the removal of much of the sur- 
face or more productive part. Aside from these more 
or less general effects of soil drifting there are other 
objectionable features such as the possible serious injury 
to adjoining crops or fields, the spread of weeds and the 
interference with traffic as a result of the accumulation 
of drifting soil in road allowances. 

218. The Chief Factors Favoring; Soil Drifting are a fine 
textured soil, low precipitation and frequent high winds 
in early summer before the land is protected by the 
growing crop. When to these are added too much or 
unsuitable surface tillage, and a system of farming 
which is wasteful of soil humus and returns little or no 
organic matter to the soil, we have a combination of 
conditions that is responsible, not only for the large 
losses from soil drifting that have already occurred, but 
also for preparing the way for still more serious losses 
in the future if some radical changes are not made in the 
methods of tillage and cropping heretofore practised in 
the affected areas. The greatest damage from this cause 
is to be observed in southern Alberta, portions of west- 
ern and southern Saskatchewan and in southwestern 
Manitoba. 

219. The Chief Causes of Soil Drifting are a high wind 
velocity and the low cohesion or binding force of the ex- 
posed soil particles. The wind velocity as well as the 
frequency of high winds and their general direction is a 
climatic condition which cannot be controlled; hence 
man's only recourse is, (1) to increase the cohesion of the 



266 DRY FARMING 

soil particles or their ability to hold together and (2) to 
reduce the exposure of the surface soil by some form of 
protection. 

220. The Means Employed to Prevent Excessive Damage 
from soil blowing therefore fall into two groups, (1) 
those that increase the resisting' power of the soil, and 
(2) those that protect the soil surface from the wind. 
Among the methods used to increase the power of the 
soil to resist the wind are, (a) increasing the moisture 
content, (b) increasing the organic matter content, and 
(c) modifying the structure of the soil. The protection 
of the soil surface from the wind may be accomplished 
by: (a) growing a protecting crop, (b) letting the stub- 
ble of one crop remain until shortly before the time of 
seeding the next crop, or, as with corn stubble, through 
the whole of the next crop season, (c) applying manure 
or straw to the field, and (d) providing artificial pro- 
tection such as the growing of windbreaks. We shall 
take time for a detailed discussion of only the more im- 
portant of these practices. 

221. Increasing the Moisture Content. — ^When a soil is 
moist its particles are not as likely to become separated 
and blow away as when the soil is dry. This fact is of 
value chiefly to the farmer on irrigated land where water 
may be applied at will. Under dry land conditions it 
becomes of value only in so far as one may by keeping the 
surface soil firm, also keep it moist to within a very short 
distance of the Surface. The chief value of packing, in 
the control of soil drifting, is to be found in the fact 
that it aids in bringing moisture from below to the sur- 
face soil, thus increasing the resistance of the particles to 
the wind. On the other hand if there is not a fair sup- 
ply of moisture in the lower soil, the breaking up and 



MANAGEMExNT OF SPECIAL SOILS 267 

levelling of the coarse surface particles by the packer 
will tend to encourage soil blowing. For this reason pack- 
ing is not a desirable practice in the control of soil drift- 
ing on all types of *soil. 

222. Increasing the Organic Matter Content. — This is 
the chief and probably the most permanent means of 
lessening the danger of soil drifting. The organic mat- 
ter content may be increased, (1) by growing perennial 
or biennial hay crops, (2) by applying farmyard man- 
ure, or (3) by plowing under green crops. The choice 
rests between (a) growing grass crops, which in some 
parts are not considered profitable, or (b) going into 
stock or mixed farming and hauling manure to the land, 
or (c) plowing under green crops, which has never been 
shown to be profitable under semi-arid conditions, or (d) 
doing all of these things. 

The use of hay crops for the purpose of adding humus 
or root fibre to the soil results in, ( 1 ) improving the soil 
as a result of their dense root systems, and (2) provid- 
ing forage for stock from which manure for further im- 
proving the soil may be obtained. The low yields of hay 
from perennial grasses under semi-arid conditions is well 
known, nevertheless the use of such hay and pasture 
crops furnishes what is probably, the best means of main- 
taining the organic matter of much of our lighter soils. 
Brome grass, owing to its very dense root system, is prob- 
ably the best for this purpose. Sweet clover promises 
much, not only as a forage crop but also as a soil improv- 
er. It has one advantage over brome grass in that it is a 
legume. It therefore leaves the soil richer in nitrogen 
than does brome grass, but the latter probably leaves 
more root fibre. 

The chief value of manure is not in its content of plant 



268 DRY FARMING 

food; the organic matter which it contains increases the 
power of the soil to hold moisture and to resist blowing. 
On drifting soils the only argument against the use of 
manure when intelligently applied is the cost of apply- 
ing it. The application of manure as a surface dressing 
on the more exposed portions that are likely to blow first 
is a preventive measure that should come into general 
practice. 

The plowing under of weeds in the fallow year, or the 
early spring growth of sweet clover or of the perennial 
grasses, is probably the only green manuring it will be 
found profitable to practise in our dry areas at the 
present time. The growing of green crops through a 
whole season in order to have a large growth to plow 
under to increase the organic matter content of the soil 
will not likely ever come into general use in the West, for 
the reason that the organic matter thus added to the soil 
is secured at the expense of an enormous quantity of soil 
moisture which is itself generally the limiting factor in 
crop yields. On soils that are low in organic matter in 
areas of light rainfall, it is questionable how far this 
practice may be carried before its waste of soil moisture 
will result in making the remedy more to be feared than 
the disease. 

223. Modifying the Structure of the Soil.— Soil drift- 
ing occurs chiefly on the fine textured soils — the sandy 
types and the heavy clays that slake down to a fine 
powdery condition on top. The fallow generally suffers 
the most, although fall plowed land is not free from 
erosion and spring plowed land on some soil types oc- 
casionally blows. The smaller the soil particles are and 
the drier they are the greater the probability of their 
drifting. The problem is therefore one of pre- 
venting the soil becoming too fine and too dry on top. 



MANAGEMENT OP SPECIAL SOILS 269 

The drying out of the top layer cannot be prevented but 
the formation of a fine "dust" mulch may be — at least 
on most soils. The use of the unfortunate term "dust 
mulch" in so much of the Western Canadian and 
American agricultural literature, is responsible for at 
least a portion of the excessive drifting that has occurred 
in recent years. The "dust" mulch has no place in 
the agriculture of any dry country where high winds 
prevail. A rough cloddy surface developed by deep 
cultivation and preferably left in small ridges by a 
cultivator is to be preferred. 

On drifting soils the cultivator should take the place 
of the disc and harrows on the fallow field. Harrowing ' 
once after the plow, in order to level the surface, is all 
the harrowing such a fallow needs if the soil is prevented 
from baking or cracking and the weeds prevented 
from growing by the use of the cultivator. More care 
in plowing in order to secure a level surface, and the 
use of the packer (preferably the sub-surface type 
packer or a disc run straight) behind the plow, are 
practices that are making harrowing less necessary and 
are proving to be more efficacious in lessening soil drift- 
ing. A ridged surface such as is left by the cultivator 
provides a refuge for the fine particles in the bottom of 
the narrow ridges, and in practice is found to result in 
less blowing and in the production of greater returns 
than a smooth surface'. "V^Jorking the soil when it is dry 
should be discouraged. When it is slightly moist below 
the surface a more granular or lumpy top can be de- 
veloped than if tilkd when dry. On smooth fields that 
are free from stones the revolving rod cultivator offers 
much promise. On the heavy clays of the Regina plains 
cultivating the fallow in the spring with a narrow tooth 
cultivator is found to lessen drifting. 



270 



DRY FARMING 



The use of the press drill leaves the soil in better con- 
dition to withstand the effects of the wind than the use of 
most other types, although on some soils the hoe drill 
has been found to give very satisfactory results. The 




Fig. 92. — Winter Rye Lessens Soil Drifting. 

On the left a field of oats was completely destroyed by drifting. The rye 

was unhurt, except for 10 or 20 feet along the edge where the soil from 

the oat field blew into the rye field. 

single disc drill is particularly undesirable on soils that 
drift. 

Shallow soils or those having a sand^^ or gravelly 
subsoil or those having a deficiency of organic matter in 
the subsoil should not be plowed deep, or they will soon 
begin to blow. The surface layer of such soils is riclier 
in organic matter and therefore much more resistant to 
the wind than the lower layers. 

224. Growing Protecting Crops.^The most serious 
drifting occurs in May before the spring sown crops 
covev the ground; but winter drifting is not uncommon 
in years of light snowfall following a dry autumn sea- 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 271 

son. In those areas where drifting is quite common the 
only fields that can be depended upon to wholly resist the 
wind action, under severe conditions, are those that are 
protected by a crop or by unplowed stubble. 

225. Perennials as Protecting Crops. — The best pro- 
tecting crops, although often the least profitable, are the 
perennials. Among these the grasses are to be preferred, 
although alfalfa and sweet clover (a biennal) are equal- 
ly as good soil protectors. It is very seldom that crops 
sown on land broken up out of sod suffer from soil drift- 
ing. In 1919 such land produced almost an average 
yield at Saskatoon while many crops on fallow and fall 
and sipring plowing were partial or complete failures as 
a result of high winds and dry weather. 

226. Winter Rye Lessens Drifting. — Another commonly 
grown crop but one less sure of furnishing the protec- 
tion needed is winter rye. This crop, like the perennials 
mentioned, may be sown in or following the rainy sea- 
son when the soil seldom blows, and by covering the 
ground in May is, like the others, likely to lessen or en- 
tirely prevent any blowing. The question of growing 
winter rye is one that deserves consideration by all 
farmers living in soil drifting areas. Where drifting 
interferes with wheat raising to such an extent as to 
make it unprofitable, winter rye, in many cases, may be 
substituted to advantage. As a commercial crop, how- 
ever, rye generally sells for twenty-five to thirty per cent, 
less than wheat, so that where the latter can be satis- 
factorily grown rye cannot compete with it as a profitable 
crop. The illustration (Fig. 92) shows very convincingly 
the relative resistance to drifting, of land protected by 
winter rye as compared with that seeded to oats, a spring 
sown crx)p. 



272 DRY FARMING 

227. Late Sown Oats for Soil Protection. — Where the 
conditions are not so serious as to require the use of one 
or more of these crops, but where some protection of the 
soil is desirable, a very thin seeding of oats or other 
cereal may be sown on the fallow in late July or early 
August and lightly pastured if necessary. These plants, 
of course, die in winter, but the roots and leaves remain- 
ing furnish considerable protection against the high 
winds the .following May. An objection to this practice 
is to be found in places where \biennial weeds are pre- 
valent. If the latter start after the cover crop is 
sown in July they will, of course, be present in the crop 
the next year, as no opportunity to kill them in the fall 
offers itself, the ground being occupied by the cover crop 
which would be destroyed if cultivated. A volunteer 
growth of grain or annual weeds in late summer has a 
similar effect to the sowing of a thin crop of oats, but is 
subject to the objections pointed out above, viz., the 
possible presence of biennial weeds that will live over and 
appear in the next crop. 

228. Stubble as a Soil Protector. — ^Where soil drifting 
occurs on fall plowed land in winter or in spring two 
alternatives present themselves, spring plowing or "stub- 
bling in." In much of the very dry portions of the 
plains region, even aside from the question of soil drift- 
ing, spring plowing is rather to be preferred to fall 
plowing. "Where these conditions obtain, of course, all 
the advantages are with the spring plowing because 
such land is protected in winter and generally blows less 
than fall plowing even in the spring. "Stubbling in" is 
only advisable on land that is free from weeds and grass 
and that is in good physical condition. In the dry parts 
and on new land it is more frequently followed than 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 273 

elsewhere. Sucli fields, of course, benefit as a result of 
protection in the early summer as well as in the preced- 
ing winter. 

229. Corn Stubble Lessens Drifting. — On warm soils 
in the southern part of all three provinces corn may be

A new machine that is being tried out on soils that are inclined to drift. 



used as a partial substitute for the fallow. Where fal- 
low land in such areas drifts badly, the use of corn as a 
Substitute for fallowing lessens the tendency to drift. 
Under severe conditions the corn ground will blow, but 
frequently the corn stubble furnishes sufficient protec- 
tion to wholly prevent serious injury from this cause. 
"Where corn is grown and the field kept free from weeds, 
plowing is, as a rule, not necessary or even advisable for 
the next crop. Disking the corn stubble generally gives 
better returns. This practice results in leaving the corn 
stubble on the surface of the soil where they form a 
considerable protection against soil drifting. 



274 DRY FARMING 

229a. Artificial Protection. — The value of windbreaks 
such as clumps of trees, hedges, fences, etc., is in 
direct proportion to their height and extent. De- 
pending upon the severity of the storm the land 
adjoining such windbreaks is generally protected 
from ten to twenty times the height of the wind- 
break, although instances have been reported where 
such protection is felt over a much greater dis- 
tance. As a means of lessening soil drifting wind- 
breaks are practicable only for small areas. No 
doubt when shelter of this kind becomes established on 
all farms the wind velocity will be lessened somewhat, 
but the cost of planting and maintaining will probably 
be found to be too great to warrant planting out enough 
trees to make any appreciable effect on the wind velocity 
on large farms in the open plains. "Where windbreaks 
such as hedges or fences are used to protect the farm- 
stead or the garden, an outer row, a few rods from an 
inner one, should be provided in order to form a "trap" 
for the drifting soil, otherwise the drift will accumulate 
within the enclosure and become a nuisance in the carry- 
ing out of the necessary farm operations. 

230. Miscellaneous Practices and Suggestions. — In fields 
where the soil has begun to blow much can be done to 
check it by going into the field and plowing either single 
furrows or narrow strips of four to six furrows from 
five to twenty-five rods apart, at right angles to the 
direction of the winds. These raised portions act as 
checks behind which the drifting particles lodge. This is 
an extreme measure and is only advisable where a small 
patch .of drifting soil promises to do serious injury to 
adjoining areas that are not likely to blow if the drifting 
material can be kept away from them. 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 275 

Arranging the areas to be seeded in long strips rather 
than approaching the square will also counteract the 
injurious effects of the soil drifting to a certain extent. 

By sowing the grain deeper than usual, thus leaving 
the soil furrowed, tends to prevent soil drifting and les- 
sens the probability of the seed or the plant roots be- 
coming exposed. 

The sandy soils take more permanent injury from 
drifting and are much less subject to favorable modifi- 
cation by tillage than the clay types ; the maintenance or 
increase of the organic matter content by applying 
manure and growing grass or legume crops becomes 
therefore of much greater importance with these than 
with heavier soils. 

The introduction of perennial grasses to the rotation 
in dry districts should be made gradually, otherwise there 
may be difficulty in adjusting the farm organization to 
the change. It is hardly necessary to point out that if 
the cropping system is altered to include the growing of 
the forage grasses and legumes, provision for the 
economical utilization of this forage should also be care- 
fully planned, otherwise the benefit to the soil arising 
from the change may be secured at too high a price. 

As curative measures after soil starts to blow there is 
very little effective treatment that can be given. Where 
isolated spots only are affected, such as light knolls or ex- 
posed elevations, spreading manure either in strips 
or over the whole surface will lessen the injury. Plow- 
ing a few furrows in strips a short distance apart on the 
lee side of such drifting areas, while a very drastic 
measure, is one that is advisable where a small area of 
drifting soil in a larger area of good soil is likely to re- 
sult in injury to the whole if not controlled in the early 



276 DRY FARMING 

stage of the blowing. The drifting particles that leave 
such light areas may during the course of several days 
of blowing affect several parts of the field, since they 
move readily from one place to another, doing injury at 
every move. It thus happens that from one small patch 
of poor land a large acreage may be severely damaged 
if drastic measures are not taken in the early stage of 
the storm. 

231. Conclusion. — The fallow is the worst to suffer 
from soil drifting and the danger is greatest in May but 
may occur in winter. The damage is increased when 
'Such surface tillage as disking and harrowing, which 
tend to make the soil fine and loose on top, is practised ; 
it is lessened by deeper tillage with cultivators which 
leave the soil in a rough, more or less lumpy condition, 
and preferably in shallow ridges. If this treatment is 
not sufficient to control the drifting h thin seeding of 
oats may be sown on the fallow in July and August, or 
in some districts corn may be used as a partial substi- 
tute for the fallow. In case one or other of these fails to 
produce the desired results, winter rye, which establishes 
itself in the fall and which has possession of the ground 
in May, and is therefore likely to prevent the blowing, 
may be used. Under more serious conditions of soil 
drifting it may be necessary to grow perennial or bien- 
niel crops and sow cereals only on the sod land, or to so 
build up the organic matter content of the soil by using 
hay and pasture crops and farmyard manure, that when 
intelligently tilled the land will not be likely to blow. 

Alkaline Soils 

The "Alkali" spots so familiar in some districts, and 
which produce low returns or none at all are the result 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 277 

of an accumulation of soluble salts of different kinds. 
In the process of weathering through long periods of 
time chemical changes in the soil result in the develop- 
ment of certain chemical compounds which are soluble. 
Some of these are useful to plants but some are harm- 
ful. In humid climates the excess is removed by drain- 
age through the soil. In semi-arid and arid climates an 
accumulation of the toxic salts occurs because there is 
insufficient rain to wash them through the soil. The 
result is they are slowly moved to the low spots by soil 
water as it seeks the lower levels, where, on the evapora- 
tion of the water the salts remain as "alkali" on or near 
the surface of the ground. 

This condition is found chiefly in countries having a 
low precipitation, and occurs in areas where the drain- 
age is poor and the evaporation high. It is a condition 
that is not general in Western Canada, but is found 
usually in small patches here and there over the whole 
West. These patches are invariably found (1) along 
the edges of old storage basins, (2) in low places where 
moisture accumulates and evaporates, and (3) in 
"springy" places below higher ground where salt im- 
pregnated water oozes from the surface and evaporates. 
Alkali frequently "rises" and often with serious conse- 
quences where too much water is applied in irrigation. 

According to Shutt* the compounds known collective- 
ly as alkali comprise chiefly sodium sulphate (Glauber's 
salts), sodium carbonate (washing soda), sodium 
chloride (common salt), magnesium sulphate (Epsom 
salts), and occasionally the chlorides of calcium and 
magnesium. 



• *In bulletin on "Alkali Soils", published by Dominion De- 
partment of Agriculture. 



278 DRY FARMING 

Black alkali is characterized by the presence of 
sodium carbonate (sal soda, washing soda) although this 
compound is almost always associated with one or more 
of the chlorides and sulphates mentioned in the preced- 
ing paragraph. Sodium carbonate is, as is well known, 
white, but from the fact that it acts upon and dissolves 
the decayed vegetable matter (humus) of the soil the 
incrustation is tinged dark brown or black — hence the 
name. "Water standing in pools on soils impregnated 
with the carbonate is invariably of a darker color and 
much resembles a strong infusion of coffee. 

232. Why Alkali is Harmful. — It is thought that the 
harmful effects of alkali result from one or more of four 
different actions: (1) the destruction of soil tilth, (2) 
the corrosive effect of those alkalies containing sodium 
carbonate, (3) the withdrawal of moisture from th? 
plant cells by osmosis, and (4) the toxic effect of some 
of the salts, 

233. The Reclamation of Alkali Soils. — In the dry lands 
where alkali spots are found the chief means to im- 
prove them are: (1) the application of manure, (2) 
surface drainage, (3) thorough tillage to lessen evapora- 
tion and (4) the use of grass crops where the alkali is 
bad or the spots too numerous or too large to attempt to 
reclaim. Manure improves the tilth and thus aids crops 
to establish themselves. Surface drainage removes the 
water carrying the alkali in solution and thus prevents 
a further accumulation of salts. 

Thorough tillage aids in lessening evaporation and the 
consequent rise of alkali with the water as the latter 
comes to the surface. Manure also aids in lessening 
evaporation. Thorough tillage and manure, by helping 
to keep the soil filled with water, help also to wash the 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 279 

alkali down to lower levels and to dilute the solution in 
the surface soil, thus frequently making profitable crop 
growing possible. 

On irrigated land, flooding and under drainage to 
wash out the soluble salts and carry them away in the 
drainage water is frequently practised. When the alkali 
contains sodium carbonate, land plaster or ground 
gypsum may be applied. This changes the black alkali 
to white alkali, a less harmful form and one that may 
more easily be removed by drainage. The removal of 
alkali by mechanical means is sometimes practised on 
high-priced land. Shutt points out also that on certain 
types of alkali or those consisting largely of magnesium 
sulphate (Epsom salts) the application of lime or marl 
before irrigation and drainage is beneficial. 

234. The Use of Alkali-Kesistant Crops.— None of the 
important field crops can be grown where the alkali is 
strong. Rye and barley are reported to be more resist- 
ant to alkali than the other cereals. Among wheats the 
macaroni varieties are said to be the best. Members 
of the beet family are the most resistant root crops for 
this type of soil. The legumes as a class do not do well 
on alkaline areas, although sweet clover is reported to be 
alkali-resistant. The forage crops or those grown for 
hay or feed rather than for seed are generally the best 
to grow on alkali land. "Western rye grass and brome 
grass are commonly sown and used either for hay or 
pasture on soils of this nature. 

Kearney in a summary of his studies on the alkali 
resistance of crops states in Bulletin No. 44 of the 
United States Department of Agriculture that "most 
field crops cannot be profitably grown when the 
quantities of white alkali salts (sulphates, bicarbonates 



280 DRY FARMING 

and chlorides) in the depth occupied by the roots ex- 
ceed one per cent, of the dry weight of the soil and only 
a few resistant species can be expected to give good crops 
when the quantity exceeds one-half of one per cent/' 

Loose Top Soils 

This is a local name applied to a peculiar type of very 
heavy soil which both in the unbroken as well as in the 
cultivated condition frequentlty carries a loose or springy 
layer of soil three or four inches in depth. The vegeta- 
tion is rather sparse, mostly grasses of a bunchy nature 
with considerable sage brush in some parts. Very few 
native trees or shrubs are found growing on it. 

This soil bakes very readily after being wet and on 
drying opens up in large cracks often wide enough to 
let the plow wheel in to the axle. The rain water and 
some of the loose particles of soil pass into these cracks 
and on freezing and expansion later there results the 
roughened surface popularly spoken of as "hummocks". 
A considerable area of this type of soil lying west and 
south of Goose Lake in Saskatchewan was spoken of 
among the early ranchers as the Saskatchewan desert. 

This soil when broken is dark in color, the loose spots 
appearing almost a slate blue. Even in dry weather it 
seems damp when plowed and if -the dry weather con- 
tinues after plowing, the soil of the furrow slice becomes 
very hard. After rains it "slakes" down forming a loose 
surface dry on top and wet underneath and inclined to 
bake and crack in the heat after heavy rains. The soil 
is very deep, rich and very fertile but cold and rather 
difficult to till. 

235. How Loose Top Land is Broken. — This land is us- 
ually broken with rod plows instead of the ordinary 



MANAGEMENT OP SPECIAL SOILS 281 

mouidboard breaker. When the breaking is not done 
with engines a sulky drawn by five or six horses is used. 
The fact that so much power is necessary to cut and 
turn over one furrow gives some indication of the heavy 
nature of the soil. The use of the heavy float or plank 
drag or scrubber on the rough surface soon after plow- 
ing and before it bakes is becoming a general practice. 
This operation is followed, as opportunity presents, by 
double disking to form a seed bed and aid in killing 
grass. To finish the season's cultivation a single or double 
stroke of the harrow is given. 

236. The Crops Grown. — Loose top land is frequently 
infested with wireworms which work havoc with cereal 
crops if they are sown first, but which injure flax very 
little. The first crop is therefore generally flax and the 
common practice is to use cereals as the second crop. 
Wheat is frequently sown on the flax stubble without any 
cultivation, although fall or spring disking is also com- 
monly followed. The practices of breaking and the use 
of flax as the first crop are quite fixed and general but 

. the best preparation for the second crop has not yet been 
determined to the satisfaction of many. 

237. Fallowing Loose Top Land. — After taking two 
crops, the land is usually fallowed, the plowing being 
done with disc plows. Motor power is in common use. 
The level land, its freedom from sloughs and stones, and 
the heavy draft all tend to foster this form of power. 
The plowed land is subsequently cultivated much the 
same as ether soils. At present discs and drag harrows 
are extensively used but cultivators are being intro- 
duced more and more. 

238. The Rotation Used. — The rotation generally prac- 
tised is a fallow and two crops, breaking, flax and 



282 DRY FARMING 

wheat at first, followed by fallow, wheat and wheat, oats 
or flax is the general rule. The small seeded annual 
weeds are quite prevalent owing to the use of so much 
flax. The weed pest together with the relatively low 
precipitation, heavy soil and somewhat unsatisfactory 
yields from fall and spring plowing is tending towards 
the three year system, — of fallow, crop and crop — with 
no plowing for the second crop. A few men are follow- 
ing the two-year system and fallowing half the land each 
year. 

"Burnt Out" Soil 

A peculiar spotted condition of what seems to be 
otherwise a normal type of soil is to be found in some 
parts of southwestern Saskatchewan, southeastern Al- 
berta and Montana. It is locally spoken of as 'Tjurnt 
out" land. Areas varying in size from a few feet in 
diameter to as many rods are found, scattered thinly in 
some areas and thickly in others, where in some manner 
the surface soil to the depth of six to ten inches seems 
to have been removed. Many settlers are of the opinion 
that these areas have at some time been 'Tjurnt out" 
leaving the prairie in the spotted condition it is found 
in to-day. The more probable explanation is that after a 
series of dry years with little vegetation on the land, it 
has become puddled after heavy rains, then slaked down 
to powder and eventually blown away by the wind. 
Whatever the explanation, it is clear that the surface soil 
has gone and that the soil now on top in these depres- 
sions appears to be quite similar in texture and compo- 
sition to the subsoil of adjoining normal soil. 

Most of these low spots are covered with grass but in 
a few areas they carry very little vegetation. After 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 283 

breaking some of them are reported to be more or less 
alkaline but many of the "burn outs" are found to be 
productive. The difficulty with and chief objection to 
them is that the texture is different from that of the good 
soil, hence the '^burnt outs" are seldom in condition to 
work when the good land is, and the crop the former pro- 
duces is either very small or very late, resulting in a 
lower yield or a lower grade. The difficulty is one of 
handling the land efficiently and of getting a high grade 
of grain. 

239. The Management of "Burnt Out" Soils.— The lower 
levels of the "burnt out" spots and the lack of organic 
matter in them are the chief causes of inconvenience and 
loss, and suggest the basis of attack. After a survey of 
the methods of handling this land the following prac- 
tices were found to be used by many of the most suc- 
cessful farmers with apparently favorable results: — 

1. Levelling with floats and harrows to get some of 
the good surface soil into the "burn outs", thus lessen- 
ing the difference in level and improving the tilth of 
these low spots. 

2. Surface drainage to prevent water standing in the 
hollows too long after rains. 

3. Heavy applications of manure either plowed under 
or used as a top dressing. 

4. In a few cases shallow fall plowing, left loose, was 
recommended. Spring cultivation with a spring tooth 
cultivator or disc harrow seemed necessary in some areas 
whether the land had been well prepared the fall previ- 
ous or not. 

5. Deep plowing of the fallow, it was frequently stat- 
ed, resulted in a more uniform and heavier crop, 

6. Some men strongly recommended the use of the 



284 DRY FARMING 

spring tooth cultivator on the fallow in preference to the 
disc, which seemed to make the soil too fine and thus 
cause it to run together more when wet. 

The plowing under of green crops, such as winter rye 
or sweet clover to increase the organic matter supply 
has not been tried out, nor has the application of slaked 
lime or finely ground limestone been tested. It is prob-

The use of fresh manure in thin applications, preferably by a manure 
spreader, is a good practice. 

able that while both of these practices might result in 
some improvemept to the soil, it would be at present too 
costly a procedure for general use by pioneer settlers. 

Vigorous floating, planking and harrowing, deep plow- 
ing, not permitting the surface to get too fine in the fall, 
working the land only when in condition, surface drain- 
age of the low spots by furrows and the application of 
manure seem to be the most promising methods of im- 
proving the productive power of this type of land. 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 285 
Poor Soils 

The soils of Western Canada are far from poor as a 
rule, but a few small areas of land have been settled upon 
that never should have been opened for homesteading. 
In a climate such as ours at this stage of our economic 
development some of the latter cannot be farmed at a 
profit, much less can they be brought up to a state of 
productiveness once their virgin fertility is lost. 

Many of our soils become "poor" after cultivation for 
a few years with no return of organic matter. The pro- 
cess is so slow and so gradual that the pioneer farmer 
seldom notices it. A false sense of security in the last- 
ing power of soils has ever blinded the first generation 
of farmers to the inevitable result of ruining the land. 
It is only where one notes the records of many years that 
the truth forces itself home. One instapce out of many 
is sufficient to illustrate this point. The average yield 
of wheat in Kansas for twenty-five years previous to 
1890 was 14 bus. 47 lbs., while for the twenty-five years 
subsequent to that date it was 12 bus. 27 lbs. The aver- 
age for oats for the first period was 33 bus. 08 lbs., and 
for the last, 22 bus. 17 lbs. 

In the early years of cultivation over much of the 
semi-arid plains of America manuring seldom produced 
large increases but after a few years cropping it has in- 
variably been found to produce excellent results. As an 
example, on the Kansas land mentioned above, where 
manure produced very little increase in the early 
years, an application equal to 23/< tons per acre per year 
during the years 1911 to 1917 increased the yield 7 1-3 
bus. or about one-half more than from unmanured land. 
Similar results have been reported from many places in 



286 DRY FARMING 

the older plains States between Kansas and Western 
Canada. 

239 A. The Value of Manure. — What has been said 
about the advantages of organic matter in Chapter III 
and in other places applies in a greater degree to manure. 
The value of this fertilizer is not chiefly in the food 




Fig. 95. — Cereal Test Plots at Beaver Lodge, Grande Prairie District, 
Northern Alberta. 

material it carries but rather in its physical and biol- 
ogical effects on the soil. It not only adds some elements 
of plant food but it improves the structure of the soil, 
increases its moisture-holding power, lessens the tend- 
ency to blow and, perhaps most important of all, in- 
creases the activity and the number of the desirable soil 
bacteria that perform the important function of making 
plant food available. 

According to Hopkins* "a, ton of fresh-mixed cattle 
and horse manure contains about 500 pounds of dry 
matter, 10 pounds of nitrogen, 2 pounds of phosphorus, 
and 8 pounds of potassium. ... By leaching and fer- 
mentation the dry matter, nitrogen, and potassium are 
lost in approximately the same proportion, but the phos- 
phorus is lost only about half as rapidly, so that one ton 

*In "Soil Fertility and Permanent Agriculture." 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 287 

of average yard manure, resulting from perhaps two 
tons of fresh manure, contains about 500 pounds of dry 
matter, 10 pounds of nitrogen, 3 pounds of phosphorus, 
and 8 pounds of potassium, one-half of the dry matter, 
nitrogen, and potassium, and one fourth of the phos- 
phorus having been lost. 

''In an experiment conducted at Cornell University, 
4,000 pounds of ordinary manure from the horse stable, 
worth $2.74 per ton for the plant food content (at com- 
mercial prices) were exposed in a pile out of doors from 
April 25 to September 22. At the end of that time 
the total weight had decreased to 1,770 pounds, worth 
only $2.34 per ton. In other words, the value of this 
pile of manure was reduced from $5.48 to $2.03 during 
five months' exposure. ... In no case should manure be 
allowed to heat and ferment before being spread on the 
land, if its full value is to be secured." 

Manure gives best results when applied thinly and 
worked well into the soil. It is usually applied (1) as 
a top dressing for grass land, or (2) plowed in before 
corn, roots, potatoes or barley, or (3) on some of the 
lighter types of soil plowed under in the fallow year. It 
may be objectionable (1) when applied thickly in dry 
areas and plowed under for a crop the same season, or 
(2) when plowed under on heavy soils in the fallow year. 
In the former case the soil may dry out, in the latter 
the growth may be too rank and weak and the crop may 
lodge. 

239B. The Place of Commercial Fertilizers. — Com- 
mercial fertilizers have not yet demonstrated that 
they have a place in our cropping system. These sub- 
stances do not, like manure, improve the tilth or physical 
or biological condition of the soil. They are valuable 
only for the nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium or lime they 



288 



DRY FARMING 



may carry. It is possible that on some soils the use of 
one or more of these fertilizers might pay even now, but 
in the few tests that have been conducted (usually on 
good soils) they have not produced sufficient increase to 
warrant their use, except perhaps in truck farming or 
potato growing. The time will come, no doubt, when it

will be necessary to apply phosphorus, the supply of 
which in our soils is not high; and we are shipping it 
away in large quantities in the grain we sell. 

Nitrogen can be gotten from the air by growing 
legumes, and the potash supply in the soil is very high, 
but unfortunately there is no means of replenishing 
the phosphorus supply except by purchasing. It is in- 
teresting to note that the use of phosphate fertilizers in 
some places results in an earlier crop of grain. 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 289 

Cold Soils 

The practice of agriculture in warm climates is based 
on the experience of four thousand years or more. Like- 
wise the practices of crop growing under irrigation have 
developed through an equally long time. Even modern 
dry farming practices are based upon the experiences 
of more than a generation. But the growing of crops 
in climates as far north as the northern settlements of 
Western Canada and Europe is a comparatively recent 
movement, and it enjoys neither the accumulated ex- 
perience of years nor the benefit of such searching 
scientific investigations as has the agriculture of other 
climatic zones. 

When the amount or the condition of the plant food in 
soil limits the yield, as in most warm humid areas, 
methods for permanently maintaining or increasing the 
yields are known. Similarly on dry lands where water 
limits the yield the science of dry farming has been 
quite thoroughly worked out. But in northern regions 
and in high altitudes where the growing season is short 
tod where low temperatures limit the yield there is 
little to be learned from the investigations of science and 
still less from the practices of older agricultural 
countries. This means that successful methods have yet 
very largely to be worked out for the crop grower along 
the northern edges of settlement. 

239C. Some Practices of Northern Agriculture. — 
At the present time some of the chief practices being 
followed where low temperatures limit the yield are as 
follows : 

(1) Ranching, which permits of the extensive use of 
the native vegetation and such frost-resistant crops as 
our hardy perennial grasses ; 



DRY FARMING 




Fig. 97. — The Windstorm at its Height. 




Fig. 97B. — After the Windstorm. 



MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL SOILS 291 

(2) Mixed farming, which may provide for the utiliza- 
tion of the native vegetation, and which permits the use 
of (1) grain crops for hay, (2) Swede turnips for suc- 
culent winter feed, and (3) the profitable use of frost- 
damaged grain as feed. 

(3) The use of early classes of grain crops, such as 
oats, barley or rye in preference to wheat ; and the use 
of early varieties such as Prelude or Ruby wheat ; sixty- 
day, Orloff or Daubeney oats; Early Six barley and 
Early White peas. 

(4) Soil management practices that result in earlier 
germination or earlier maturity such as (a) packing the 
land, (b) less frequent fallowing, (c) shallow plowing 
of the fallow, (d) later plowing of the fallow, and (e) 
the use of manure to warm up cold soils. 

(5) Thicker seeding — No combination of practices 
will result in preventing damage to grain crops from 
summer frosts, but a few days earlier maturity may les- 
sen the probability of injury from fall frosts. Thick 
seeding results in somewhat earlier maturity of the crop. 



CHAPTER XVI 

LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 

The Great Plains Region of North America includes 
a large part of the Prairie Provinces of Canada and most 
of the United States lying between the Mississippi Valley 
and the Rocky Mountains. This large area includes 
many soils and climatic conditions and its problems 
therefore, are not the same in all parts. They are, how- 
ever, sufficiently similar to justify the inclusion under 
one cover of the experiences of the settlers in its different 
parts. It has therefore been thought wise to ask some 
of the leading agronomists in this large area to sum- 
marize the experience of the best farmers and the re- 
sults of experiment station work in their respective 
states and provinces. These summaries, for which the 
author is very much indebted to the writers, are as fol-

240. Summer Tillage. — 

Spring Wheat: — Summer tillage without crop has 
given the highest average yields of any method under

in which may be found the evidence upon which the conclusions 
herewith reproduced are based.

trial at 12 of the 14 stations. However, on account of 
its high cost due to extra labor and alternate year crop- 
ping, it has not been the most profitable practice. (Bui. 
214, —p. 43-11). 

Winter Wheat: — Summer tillage has given the high- 
est average yields of any method under trial at 11 of the 
13 stations. However, on account of its high cost due 
to extra labor and alternate year cropping it has not 
netted the largest returns except at Huntley (Montana). 
(Bui. 595, —p. 35-10). 

Oats: — Oats following summer tillage produced the 
highest average yields at all stations except Hettinger 
(N.D.) where the yield was exceeded only by that on 
disked corn ground. While the expense of the method 
has prevented its being the most profitable the degree 
of insurance which it affords against failure of the feed 
crop might justify its practice in oat production in at 
least some sections of the Great Plains. (Bui. 218 — p. 
42-9). 

Barley: — The highest average yields at 11 of the 14 
stations have been by summer tillage. On the average 
it increased the yields nearly one-half over those pro- 
duced on land cropped in the preceding year. On ac- 
count of its cost, it has not been the most profitable meth- 
od of production. (Bui. 222— p. 32-3). 

Corn: — Summer tillage has slightly increased the 
grain yields at all except three stations and has materially 
increased fodder yields at the three southern stations. 
The increased yields, however, have not been sufficient to 
make it the most profitable method at any station except 
Scottsbluff (Nebraska). (Bui. 219— p. 31-3). 

241. Corn or Sorghums vs. the Fallow. — 

Spring Wheat :— Disked com ground has given con- 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 295 

sistently high yields. This, together with the low cost of 
preparation, has resulted! in its showing the highest 
average profit or lowest average loss of any of the meth- 
ods tried at all fourteen of the stations except one. These 
profits are based on the assumption that the corn crop 
was so utilized as to pay for the cost of its production. 
(Bui. 214— p. 43-7). 

Oats: — At G-arden City (Kansas) and all stations 
nofth of North Platte (Nebraska) disking corn ground 
has been productive of higher average yields of oats than 
either fall or spring plowing. At North Platte (Nebras- 
ka), Hays (Kansas), Dalhart and Amarillo (Texas), it 
yielded either the same as one of them or its place was 
intermediate between the two. (Bui. 218 — p. 41-5). 

Barley -. — At ten of the fourteen stations under study, 
disked corn ground produced higher yields than from 
either the fall plowing or the spring plowing of barley 
stubble. It has been the most profitable method under 
trial at all the stations except Hettinger (N.D.). (Bui. 
222— p. 32). 

Winter Wheat: — Disked corn ground has given con- 
sistently high yields. This, together with the low cost of 
production, has resulted in this method showing the high- 
est average yields of any of the methods at all of the 11 
stations where it has been tried, except at Huntley (Mon- 
tana) and Am'arillo (Texas). These profits are based on 
the assumption that the corn crop was so utilized as to 
pay for the cost of producing it. (Bui. 595 — p. 35-p) . 

242. When Disking May Be Substituted for Plowing — 
These investigations have shown that when the corn crop 
has been grown on properly prepared land and kept free 
from weeds, the land does not require plowing in prepar- 
ation for a following crop of sm^all grain. Wheat, oats 



296 DRY FARMING 

and barley have usually given better yields on disked 
corn land than upon land that has been plowed. This, 
together with the fact that disking is cheaper than plow- 
ing, makes disking corn land generally the most profit- 
able method of preparation for small grain. Discing 
potato land is probably as good a preparation for small 
grain as disking corn land, and there are undoubtedly 
other intertilled "crops such as peas, beans and peanuts 
that will serve the same purpose. The sorghums, how- 
ever, do not le'ave the ground in as favorable a condition 
for the crop that is to follow as the other crops men- 
tioned. (Bui. 268— p. 22). 

243. The Use of the Lister in the Fall. — The practice 
of ridging with a lister as a substitute for fall plowing, 
and cultivating down level without the use of a plow in 
the spring has been tested at most of the stations as a 
preparation for all of the small grain crops considered in 
this bulletin except winter wheat. It has usually pro- 
duced as good or better yields than fall plowing. Its 
lower cost has madte it in many instances nearly or quite 
as profitable a method as disking com stubble. In addi- 
tion to its low cost it has the advantage of catching and 
holding the snow and checking soil blowing during the 
winter and of arresting run-off. 

When the lister is used in preparing land for winter 
wheat, the listing is done immediately after the harvest 
of the preceding crop. The soil is worked down level, 
usually with a disc, in late summer or early fall and then 
seeded with an ordinary grain drill. Very little differ- 
ence in average yields between listing and plowing have 
been noted except at Hays (Kansas), where the ad- 
vantage is in favor of listing. (Bui. 268 — p. 22). 

244. How and When to Plow. — The comparative aver- 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 



297 



age yields from fall and from spring plowing at each 
station for corn, spring wheat, oats, barley, milo and 
kafir have shown but small differences. As the land re- 
quires plowing for all annual crops except in those cases 
above noted, and as plowing is an expensive operation, it 
is a question of great economic importance as to h^ow and 




\P' • . <'&^9'' -j^h^

Fig. 98. — Harvesting Winter Wheat with a Header iii Kansas. 

when this plowing should be done. Much has been writ- 
ten upon this subject and many theories have been de- 
veloped and advocated, but the investigations conducted 
in the Great Plains by the Office of Dry Land Agricul- 
ture seem, to Show conclusively that no set rule can safely 
be followed. The best practice seems to be to do a good 
clean-cut workmanlike job of plowing to a depth of from 
4 to 8 inches when the soil is in proper condition and the 
work can be done to the best advantage, taking into con- 
sideration the most economical distribution of labor 
throughout the year. (Bui. 268— p. 23). 
245. The Purpose of Plowing. — It is mistaking or fail- 



298 DRY FARMING 

ing to recognize the purpose of plowing that leads to the 
belief that its efficiency increases with its depth, even 
though that depth be extended below all practical limits 
of cost and effort. Plowing does not increase the water- 
holding capacity of the soil, nor the area in which roots 
may develop, or from which the plants may obtain food. 
Plowing removes from the surface either green or dry 
material that may encumber it, provides a surface in 
which planting implements may cover the seed, and re- 
moves or delays the competition of weeds or plants other 
than those intended' to grow, and in some cases, by loosen- 
ing and roughening the immediate surface checks the 
run-off of rain water. All- these objects are accomplished 
as well by plowing to ordinary depths as by subsoiling, 
dynamiting, or deep tilling by any other method. There 
is little basis, therefore, for the expectation of increased 
yield^s from these practices, and the results of these ex- 
periments show that they have been generally ineffective. 
(Journal of Agricultural Research, Vol. XIV, No. 11— 
p. 484). 

The quite general popular belief in the efficiency of 
deep tillage as a means of overcoming drouth or of in- 
creasing yields has little foundation in fact, but is based 
on misconceptions and lack of knowledge of the form and 
extent of the root systems of plants and of the behaviour 
and movement of water in the soil. {loc. cit. — p. 521). 

245a. Green Manuring. — Green manuring has not usu- 
ally given as high yields of spring wheat, winter wheat, 
oats or barley as has summer tillage. It has yielded but 
little if any higher than disked corn ground with any of 
these crops. It is much more expensive even than sum- 
mer tillage. There is not yet any apparent cumulative 
effect of the addition of humus to the soil, although it has 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 299 

been practised at some of the stations for twelve years. 
The evidence so far as to its practicability is negative. 

246. Destruction of Weeds. — The destruction of weeds 
is nearly always desirable, as undler dry-farming condi- 
tions weed's are one of the most serious obstacles to suc- 
cessful crop production. When summer tillage is prac- 
tised on a bare fallow during the entire season, cultiva- 
tion should be frequent and thorough enough to destroy 
all weeds before they attain sufficient size to transpire 
appreciable quantities of water or to reseed themselves. 
This tillage will also keep the surface in a condition suf- 
ficiently loose and open to allow the rain that falls to 
penetrate it. When the soil becomes well filled with 
water early in the season and additional rains can reason- 
ably be expected, it may sometimes be desirable to allow 
the weeds to attain a larger growth and then plow them 
under in order to provide additional organic matter in 
the soil, but it must be borne in mind that this gain in 
organic matter is made at the expense of the soil 
moisture. 

Our investigations show that summer tillage is, with 
the exception of green manuring, the most expensive and 
least profitable method under trial. Exceptions are to be 
noted in the case of kafir and milo at Dlalhart, com at 
Scottsbuff, and winter wheat at North Platte and 
Huntley. 

The purpose of summer tillage is accomplished by the 
prevention of vegetative growth rather than by the main- 
tenance of a mulch. Numerous experiments made in con- 
nection with this work have furnished an abundance of 
evidience that when vegetative growth is restrained the 
loss of water from a mulched surface is practically the 
same as from an unmulched one. 



300 DRY FARMING 

The cheapest and most efficient methods of weed de- 
struction necessarily form a soil mulch. The results ac- 
cruing from the prevention of weed growth have been 
very generally attributed to the mulch itself when the 
mulch is, in fact, only accidental. 

Tillage for the purpose of destroying weeds after har- 
vest is warranted only in those exceptional cases when 
sufficient water remains in the soil to start weed growth 
after harvest or when heavy rains come soon after. In 
such cases early fall plowing is the most effective method 
of destroying the weeds and thus saving the moisture that 
would be used by them if allowed to grow. The same 
object may be accomplished by disking soon after the 
weeds have started. This method has the advantage of 
being more rapid than plowing, thus making it possible 
to cover more ground with the same number of teams 
and men. But as the land will have to be plowed before 
another crop is sown, the labor of disking is mostly lost, 
although the labor of plowing the disked land may be 
somewhat less than if it were not disked and a better job 
of plowing may sometimes be done on the disked land. 
The cost of early fall plowing or disking, when the wea- 
ther is hot and the men and teams are needed for stack- 
ing, threshing, and hauling grain, is greater than later 
in the fall, when the weather is cooler and there is less 
other work for men and teams. All of these facts should 
be taken into consideration before going to the extra 
expense of tillage to kill weeds immediately after harvest. 

Spring plowing or disking, as soon as the weed seeds 
have germinated, is usually a profitable practice. Where 
small grain is to be sown, the sowing should be done soon 
after plowing ,• but where corn, potatoes, or the sorghums 
are to be grown there is often a period of several weeks 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 301 

between the time of the germination of the weed seeds 
and the time when the season is sufficiently advanced to 
plant the crop. This period should be utilized as far as 
possible for the destruction of weeds before the crop is 
planted. Much labor in keeping the crop free from 
weeds during its growing period can thus be saved. 

Harrov/ing small grain for the destruction of weeds 
after the grain is sown and until it has reached a height 
of 3 or 4 inches may sometimes be practised to advantage. 
Experimental evidence does not show it to be generally 
profitable. Harrowing corn and potatoes after planting 
and until the young plants have attained a height of 2 
or 3 inches is quite generally practised to advantage. 

It is absolutely essential for the most profitable growth 
of com, potatoes, the sorghums, and, in fact, all the inter- 
tilled crops, that sufficient tillage be given to keep the 
growing crop free from weeds until the plants have at- 
tained such growth that they will be seriously injured by 
the cultivators or the horses. (Bui. 268 — p. 24-25). 

247. The Application of the Capillary Theory to Dry 
Fanning Practices. — The capillary theory is undoubtedly 
responsible for more false reasoning about dry l&nd agri- 
culture than any other one thing. It is a convenient 
theory to explain certain well-known phenomena such as 
the rise of oil in a lamp wick, but it must be taken in its 
entirety. It will not do to eliminate the one most import- 
ant factor in the theory and then expect it to work. This 
one factor is the presence of a constantly replenished sup- 
ply of free-moving vmter at the base of the system. In 
other words, a permanent water table within a few feet 
of the surface of the soil, a condition that is never met 
under true dry land conditions. Therefore, any system 
of dry land farm) practice that is dependent upon the as- 



302 DRY FARMING 

sumption that there is a continuous upward movement of 
soil water by capillarity of sufficient magnitude to materi- 
ally affect crop growth will prove disappointing when 
put to the test of actual field practice, as has' been done 
in the extensive investigations conducted during the past 
fourteen years in the Great Plains by the Office of Dry 
Land Agriculture. 

A careful study of hundreds of thousands of soil mois- 
ture determinations fails to show any such movement. 
The s'oils of the semi-arid regions undoubtedly do lose 
large quantities of soil water, but this loss is undoubtedly 
due almost entirely to some one, or to a combination of 
two or more, of three factors, utilization by the growing 
crop, transpiration from growing weeds, or loss from 
internal evaporation and escape from the soil to the at- 
mosphere in the form! of water vapor. Only such methods 
of moisture conservation as will prevent loss from these 
sources are worth considering, so far as the water which 
has actually entered the soil is concerned. Excessive run- 
off may be retarded and the absorption of water by the 
surface soil may be facilitated to a limited extent by 
proper methods of surface tillage. But any method of 
tillage calculated to prevent capillary rise and surface 
evaporation of soil water in semi-arid regions will be use- 
less except in so far as it stimulates the growth of crop 
plants, destroys weeds or retards their growth, or checks 
the escape of water vapor from cracks or other openings 
in the soil. 

248. Farm Organization and Crop Rotations. — As for- 
age crops of some kind can profitably be grown at all 
stations, they must occupy an important place in any 
system of farming adapted to the Great Plains. Suf- 
ficient live stock must be kept to convert these crops into 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 303 

finished products on the farm and sufficient forage must 
be produced' and stored during the favorable seasons to 
carry the live stock through specially unfavorable 
seasons. 

Gt)od farming is an essential to success in the Great 
Plains area as elsewhere. Good farming means practic- 
ing the best method of producing the largest crops at the 
lowest relative cost of production and leaving the soil in 
the best condition for the production of subsequent crops. 
Good farming may involve methods either intensive or 
extensive, either expensive or inexpensive ; and it must 
be practical and economical as well as scientific and 
thorough in order to be g'ood farming. It is just as poor 
farming to go to too much expense as it is to go to too 
little expense to accomplish a given result. These investi- 
gtations show that the largest net profits have usually 
been obtained from crops raised by cultural methods 
involving a low cost of production rather than from high 
yields obtained under methods involving a high cost of 
pr'oduction. Lessening the cost of production without 
proportionately lessening yields should therefore be given 
first consideration. In other words, extensive rather than 
intensive systems, of farming should be followed. 

Different types of soil and different combinations of 
climatic conditions require different cultural methods and 
different combinations of crops to produce the most pro- 
fitable results. 

The personality of the farmer and his family ; the size, 
location, soil and environment of the farm ; market facili- 
ties and prices; the availaible capital, in cash, labor, or 
equipment, may any or all be determining factors in the 
problem of profitable dry farming in the Great Plains 
area. 



304 . DRY FARMING 

Dry farming in the Great Plains area, in common with 
all farming, to be successful must be systematized, and in 
order to accomplish this, some definite rotation of crops 
should be established. In planning such a rotation, due 
consideration should be given to all the factors here enu- 
merated, as they apply to each particular farm and far- 
mer. With these considerations clearly in mind, it is 
believed that no intelligent farmer will experience any 
great difficulty in adopting a system of crop rotation and 
farm organization that will be better adapted to his con- 
ditions than any that could be proposed by anyone less 
familiar with these conditions than is the farmer him- 
self. (Bui. 268— p. 27-28). 

DRY. FARMING PRACTICES IN KANSAS 

By L. E. Call, Professor of Agronomy, Agricultural 
College, Manhattan, Kansas. 

The average annual rainfall of Kansas varies from less 
than sixteen to over forty-five inches. In the eastern two- 
thirds of the state, it exceeds twenty-two inches while in 
the western third, it is less than this amount. The aver- 
age annual rainfall is ample for all crops in the eastern 
two-thirds of the State, but irregular distribution and 
very rapid evaporation dfuring the growing season often 
makes it necessary to conserve moisture with care if 
profitable crops are to be produced. It is only in the west- 
ern third of Kansas that moisture is so deficient that it is 
necess'arj'- to use the bare summer fallow in the cropping 
system. In this section, fallowing is not necessary more 
often than once in three to five years, and even then may 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 305 

not be necessary if the fallow season should prove unusu- 
ally favorable. 

249. The Place of Summer Tillage. — The sorghum crops 
and winter wheat are the most dependable dry farming 
crops for Kansas. These crops must be grown in rota- 
tion for best results. It is advisable in western Kansas 
to summerf allow sorghum ground in changing from sorg- 
hum to wheat unless conditions are unusu'ally favorable. 
In an unusually wet fall, wheat may be sown on disked 
sorghum ground, (and in an unusually wet spring, barley 
miay be sown on disked sorghum ground in the spring. 
At all other times, it is best to summerf allow sorghum 
ground for wheat. 

The best method of preparing sorghum ground for 
wheat is to disk the ground in the spring after the first 
weeds start. This kills the first crop of weeds and starts 
other weed seeds germinating. The ground is then plowed 
before the second growth of weeds becomes too large and 
in time to finish plowing before harvest. The fallow is 
usually plowed in late May or early June. It is left with- 
out work until after wheat harvest which occurs in July. 
In August and early September, it is worked dbwn and 
the wheat seeded in late September. Care must be exer- 
cised not to work the fallow ground more than necessary 
to kill weedis and to prepare a good seedbed for wheat, 
otherwise, the surface of the field may be left too smooth 
and the wheat injured by soil drifting during the winter. 
When stubble ground is summerfallowed, it is handled 
in the same manner. It is the usual practice to grow 
wheat at least three years after fallowing before chang- 
ing the ground to sorghum. The first year the wheat is 
on fallowed ground. The second year the crop is 
drilled in the stubble and the third season, the ground is 
plowed after harvest and the crop seeded the same fall. 



306 



DRY FARMING 



The next year the field is changed to a sorghum crop. 
After growing sorghum from one to three years the land 
is fallowed and returned to wheat. Corn frequently re- 
places sorghum in this rotation, or corn may be planted!

after the sorghum crop in place of the fallow. It is only 
under the most favorable conditions that corn should be 
used in this way. 

250. Kansas Dry Farm Crops. — ^The best dry farming 
crops in Kansas are of two distinct kinds. First, those 
that are able to withstand extremely hot summer weather 
and take advantage of moisture whenever rain may occur 
and second, those that mature early enough in the spring 
to escape the hot dry summer weather. 

The sorghumjs are the best example of the first class of 
crops. They have the ability to withstand high temper- 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 307 

atures and to remain in an uninjured condition for a 
long period of time without rain. There are varieties of 
sorghums adapted to many different uses. Kafir, milo, 
feterita and kaoliang are especially valued for the pro- 
duction of grain ; the sweet sorghums such as black amber 
red amber, orange and sumac are very large growing, 
leafy plants and are especially valuable for fodder and 
silage; while Sudan grass is more grass-like in character 
and is especially valuable for hay and pasture. Kansas 
is fortunate in having this valuable sorghum family of 
crops so well adapted to the dry farming sections of the 
State. 

251. Crops That Mature Early. — ^Winter wheat is the 
best example of those crops that mature early. It ma- 
tures in late ."lune or early July and thus escapes the hot 
sumnacr months. The best winter wheat varieties are 
those that mature early and at the same time are winter 
hardy. Varieties of the Turkey Red type have given 
best results. Of these, Kanred, a variety developed at the 
Kansas Expei'iment Station, is the best. It matures some- 
what earlier than other varieties of Turkey, is more win- 
ter hardy, less susceptible to most diseases and is some- 
what more productive. Spring wheat always matures 
later than winter wheat and consequently is more often 
injured by hot weather. It cannot be successfully grown 
in Kansas except in the northwestern part where the 
elevation is higher and the summers cooler than in the 
rest of the State. Barley is the best dry land spring 
grain for Kansas. It matures earlier than oats and conse- 
quently produces more grain. When oats are sown only 
very early varieties such as Burt and Red Texas should 
be used. 

252. The Amount of Seed to Sow. — Where moisture 



308 DRY FARMING 

is limited it is not advisable to sow grain too tliick, other- 
wise the supply of mbisture may be exhausted before the 
crop is matured. The quantity to sow will depend upon 
the character of the soil, and the time of seeding. On 
well prepared summer fallowed ground, one-half bushel 
of winter wheat is sufficient seed to sow in western Kan- 
sas. On ground less well prepared, a bushel of seed is 
often necessary. When wheat is sown very late in the 
season, more seed should be used for it will tiller less 
and therefore, should be sown thicker, 

DRY FARMING IN NEBRASKA 

By W. W. Burr, Professor op Agronomy, 

Agricultural Experiment Station, 

Lincoln, Neb. 

A large portion of tlie cultivated! land west of the 
hundredth meridian in Nebraska is under what is com- 
monly called dry farming. The conditions that deter- 
mine dry farming are a dry subsoil and a limited rain- 
fall. Within the area mentioned in western Nebraska 
are sub-irrigated areas where sheet water comes close to 
the surface, and there we could not say that dry farming 
is practised. Obviously, where water is applied by irri- 
gation, it is not dry farming. 

The early experiences of farmers in western Nebraska 
were far from,' satisfactory, and many failures resulted. 
There were several causes for this, aside from the uncer- 
tainty of the weather, — lack of experience in dry regions, 
poorly adapted crops, and lack of working capital prob- 
ably being the main ones. The conditions have changed 
considerably in the last 15 years. Out of the experiences 
of the farmers ha,ve crystallized some very sound and 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 309 

definite information. To this have been added results of 
agricultural investigations, all of Which has brought 
about a much better understanding of the situation. More 
adapted crops, more suitable machinery, and, what is per 
haps even more important, the farmers have accumulated 





-,«^.'

a working capital or a credit, sufficient to tide them over 
adverse seasons. 

The dry farming area of Nebraska contains many 
types of soil. Considerable areas are so sandy as to be 
unfitted for grain production, and the farming opera- 
tions are confined largely to supplementing the native 
feed for live stock. In other areas the soil is heavier. It 
is fertile, and with sufficient moisture responds abund- 
antly to grain cropping. No very distinct methods are 
employed in dry farming. The amount and kind of till- 
age is usually determined by the seasonal conditions and 
the available supply of man and team labor. 

253. Summer Tillage is not extensively practised in 



310 DRY FARMING 

Nebraska. It is occasionally practised on limited areas 
in preparation for winter wheat or in preparation for a 
grass crop or alfalfa. The farmers have foundi that 
wheat is quite as certain after corn as it is after summer 
tillage, though the yield may be somewhat less. The 
cultivation of the corn costs practically no more than 
the summer tillage, and by growing the corn they obtain 
a considerable amount of roughage and usually a grain 
crop. The roughage is an imtportant factor, since in 
almost all of our dry farming sections considerable live 
stock is carried. Where summer tillage is practised, the 
land is usually left uncultivated until after corn plant- 
ing, when it is plowed ; and after plowing, sufficient cul- 
tivation is given with a disc or harrow to keep down 
weed growth. 

254. Crop Rotation. — There is no very definite system 
of rotation in the dry farming area. The most nearly 
definite is corn and Winter wheat alternating. The win- 
ter wheat is usually drilled with a one-horse drill into 
the standing corn. Later the corn is harvested, usually 
by husking from the standing stalks and then turning 
the stock in to get what rough feed they can. Where the 
corn has been kept fairly clean, this is a very satisfactory 
w:ay of growing winter wheat. The wheat goes into a 
firm seed bed and has the stalks and stubble to catch 
snow and serve as a protection from blowing during the 
winter. Ordinarily the wheat stubble is prepared for 
corn simply by disking it early in the spring and then 
putting in the corn with the lister. 

255. Crop Adaptation, — This is a very important factor 
in the development of any section. Obviously no amount 
or kind of tillage will make profitable the production of 
a poorly adapted croip. All o^f the ordinary grain crops 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 311 

suitable to this section are grown in the western part of 
our State. Winter wheat is tending to replace spring 
wheat. Turkey Red winter wheat is most commonly 
grown and is well adapted. Both common and Macaroni 
spring wheats are grown, and no one variety has proved 
mjarkedly superior to several others. In most of the area 
the early type of oats has proved superior to the later 
types. Kherson is most commonly grown. Ordinary 
six-rowed barley has proved superior to any of the two- or 
four-rowed variety. The comparatively small types of 
corn are grown, the size varying with the section and the 
probable amount of available water. Under the most 
extreme conditions a rather flinty type of corn with a 5- 
or 6-inch ear is grown, while under more favorable con- 
ditions they grow an 8 to 10-incli ear decidedly more 
dent in type. Alfalfa grows abundantly in the bottom 
lands where sheet water is within reach of the deep 
roots. It is grown, but with less certainty of production, 
on the uplands. For seed purposes it is sometimes grown 
in rows. Millets and Sudan grass are successfully grown 
• throughout the entire area. Sorghum for forage is prob- 
ably the predominant annual forage crop. Grain sorg- 
hums are not extensively grown. 

256. Cultural Practices. — Small grain is almost ani- 
versally planted with a grain drill in preference to broad- 
cast seeding. Corn is usually planted with a lister. 
Early planting is advisable for all small grain crops, as 
it tends to get them ahead of the usual dTy, hot weather 
of midsummer. Corn is planted early in the frost-free 
period. 

The usual rates of seeding are much less than under 
more humid conditions. The following are the common 
rates per acre : Winter wheat, 40 to 50 pounds ; spring 



312 DRY FARMING 

wheat, 4 pecks ; oats, 6 peeks ; barley, 6 pecks ; com, one 
stalk to 18 to 24 inches in the row. 

Harrowing small grain is not extensively practised. On 
the average it has not proved beneficial. Under certain 
conditions, where ground cracks or where there are many 
young weeds that may be killed, harrowing might be ad- 
visable. The harrow is often used to break down stand- 
ing cornstalks where grain has been sown in the corn. 

Deep plowing, or in fact stirring the soil in any man- 
ner to a greater depth than ordinary 6- to 8-inch plowing, 
nas not given average increased yields nor shown any 
particular advantage in overcoming drought. It has 
greatly increased the labor cost and lessened the acreage 
that a man with a given equipment can handle. After 
plowing, the furrow slice is usually worked down with a 
disc or harrow. The subsurface packer is not in general 
use but may have an important place, especially where 
small seeded crops such as grass or alfalfa are to be 
sown. Getting the soil firm is an important factor, since 
the loose soil will dry out much more quickly than the 
more firmly packed soil. 

257. The Farming Unit. — In the dty farming section 
the farming unit is comparatively large. Intensive cul- 
tivation is not generally practised. Broadly speaking, 
elilnatic conditions are more important than tillage meth- 
ods in determining yields. Naturally when the differ- 
ences of yield that come from climatic causes are greater 
than differences due to other factors, cost of production 
becomes the most important factor and the system of 
farming tends to become increasingly extensive. 

258. Live Stock. — In order to equalize income, live 
stock is alm/ost essential to farming under our dry land 
conditions. Where strict grain farming is followed, a 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 313 

erop failure is apt to be very serious; but where both 
grain and live stock are raised, there is the chance, if the 
necessity arises, of selling off some of the live stock in 
order to get through the period of stress. Animals are 
also important in that they furnish a profitable market 
for the roughage produced on the farm. Without stock, 
this roughage would have little value and probably would 
be wasted. 

259. The Possibilities for Dry Farming. — Even under 
the climatic limitations, the possibilities for dry farming 
are good for the man who will work in accord with 
nature. He needs a reasonable amount of capital and a 
clear understanding of conditions. He should not allow 
himself to be hampered by false hopes and theories, nor 
try to farm by hard and fast rules. Under the erratic 
climatic conditions of that section, any system of farm- 
ing to be successful mtust be sufficiently elastic to meet 
conditions as they arise. By studying the conditions as 
they exist on his own farm and carefully considering the 
various factors that influence crop production, he can 
'determine the kind and amount of labor that should be 
expended. By doing each operation in the most advan- 
tageous way and as nearly as possible at the rig'ht time, 
the labor required ean be materially decreased, more land 
gotten over with a given amount of equipment, and the 
cost of production lowered. 

DRY FARMING PRACTICES IN SOUTH DAKOTA 

By Manley Champlin, Formerly Associate Professor 
OF Agronomy, Brookings, S. D. 

The average rainfall in South Dakota varies from 25 
inches in the southeast to about 14 or 15 inches in the 



314 



DRY FARMING 



northwest section. Most of the rain comes during the 
spring and summer months. There is usually a light 
snow-fall and comparatively little rain in the autumn. 
The months of April, May and June are generally well 
provided with moisture and occasionally good rains occur 
in July and August, but there are short periods of dirouth

Dakota. 



in some parts of the state nearly every season and suc- 
cessful farjning or crop production depends to a very 
great extent upon the success which one has in over- 
coming these short periods of drouth. There are occa- 
sional seasons such as the year 1911 when certain crops 
are failures in spite of good tillage and crop rotation 
methods, but there has not been any season since the 
State was settled fhat has not been favorable to some 
crops. It therefore is excellent policy to diversify as 
much as is practicable in order to avoid total loss in any 
one season. 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 315 

260. Summerfallowing. — Summerfallowing is practised 
very little. Successful crops are frequently produced 
on summerfallow, but on account of the loss of the in- 
come from the land for a season incident to this practice, 
it has never become a common one in the state. When 
summerfallowing is practised the land is plowed 5 or 6 
inches deep in June, disked three or four times during 
the summer to keep the weeds down and usually sown to 
winter rye during the latter part of August. This prac- 
tice gives good results and could be more generally adop- 
ted in the western two-thirds of the state. 

261. Crop Eotation. — 'Crop rotation is a very important 
factor, not only in insuring safe crop production, but 
also in increasing the yield and improving the quality 
of the crops. Fortunately, it is possible for the farmer 
here to rotate his crops to the best advantage of the land 
and at the same time produce crops that are profitable. 
Among the cultivated crops corn is easily first. In fact 
it is the most important cereal crop of the state. Pota- 
toes, amber sorghum, navy beans and soy beans may also 
be grown as cultivated crops. Oats, barley, spring wheat, 
emmer, spring rye and winter rye as well as proso and 
millet furnish wide choice among the small grain crops. 
Sweet clover is the leading biennial legume. It is hardy 
so far as we know in all parts of the state and it is easier 
to secure a stand of sweet clover than any of the other 
small seeded legume crops. Red clover can be grown in 
the southeastern and eastern sections, but it is very dif- 
ficult to obtain a stand in the drier parts of the state 
with this kind of clover. Canadian field peas and oats 
are sometimes grown together as hog pastures or as a 
temporary hay crop. Soy beans are occasionally mixed 
with corn for silage. Alfalfa succeeds in nearly all parts 



316 DRY FARMING 

of the state and may be used as a permanent meadow or 
may be treated as if it were a short-lived crop and used 
in the rotation. Experiments conducted at the State 
Agricultural College experiment farms in various parts 
of the state indicate that a three-year rotation of corn, 
small grain and sweet clover is very satisfactory. This 
rotation is easy to take care of and is satisfactory from 
the economic or business standpoint. It is also a good 
rotation for maintaining the soil in good condition. It 
is handled about as follows : the land is divided into three 
parts approximately equal, the first field is plowed 6 or 
8 inches deep in the fall. In the spring this field is har- 
rowed to break up the lumps and level the ground. About 
the first of May or a little later, it is double disked to 
further pulverize the seed bed and kill weeds. It is then 
harrowed again and planted to corn, potatoes or whatever 
cultivated crop may be desired. This crop receives 
thorough cultivation, usually from three to five cultiva- 
tions during the season to keep it as free from weeds as 
possible. The following year this land is double disked 
and dragged in the spring without plowing and is sown 
to an early maturing variety of grain with 10 or 15 
pounds of sweet clover per acre. If alfalfa is preferred, 
it may be substituted for the sweet clover. The grain 
crop is harvested leaving the stubble to protect the clover 
or alfalfa plants during the second winter. The third 
year this field will be producing sweet clover or alfalfa. 
A crop of sweet clover hay will be ready to cut by the 
10th to the 15th of June. A seed crop will be ready late 
in August or early in September. If in alfalfa the crop 
will be cut from one to three times according to the abun- 
dance of moisture during the season. It is not best to 
cut it after the first of September as the alfalfa is more 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 317 

likely to winter in good shape with a liberal aftermath. 
After the rotation is in full swing there will be one field 
in corn or other cultivated crop, one fiield in small grain 
and one field in legume, either sweet clover or alfalfa. 
Variations in this plan of rotation are easily made and 
work out very nicely. In fact the rotation is so adapt- 
able that it can be made to fit almost any requirement. 
It can be changed to a four-course rotation by growing 
two crops of corn in sucession, followed by the grain and 
sweet clover or to a five-course rotation by growing corn 
in one field for silage, following it with winter rye, fol- 
lowing the rye with corn for grain and the corn in turn 
with spring grain and sweet clover or alfalfa. The prin- 
ciple involved in sucessful crop rotation in South Dakota 
consists in providing for a cultivated crop preceding the 
grain crop in order to conserve moisture and render the 
seed bed firm and in good tilth for the seeding of the 
grain and the hay crop. Yields in favorable seasons are 
often doubled by this practice and in unfavorable seasons 
yields are secured that are very satisfactory while the 
crop on land put into grain continuously may prove a 
total failure. 

262. Drought-Resistant Crops. — In the early years of 
South Dakota's development great difficulty was experi- 
enced because the crops which the settlers attempted to 
grow were not of the proper variety. Through the efforts 
of tlie United States Department of Agriculture and the 
State College of Agriculture crops have been introduced 
from south-central Russia and other countries where con- 
ditions are somewhat similar and thoroughly tested in 
comparison with varieties from other sources, until the 
ones which were best for South Dakota conditions were 
determined. After introduction and testing, these var- 



318 DRY FARMING 

ieties have been distributed tihrough the efforts of the 
South Dakota Experiment Association until at the pre- 
sent time nearly all of the crops grown in the state are 
of adapted varieties. Odessa, S.D, 182 barley can be 
grown successfully throughout the state. Manchuria, 
Minnesota 105 is well adapted to the eastern section. 
Among the oat varieties, Sixty Day S.D. 165 and its 
selections have proved best and are generally grown. 
Two medium late varieties are fairly popular, namely, 
the Swedish Select S.D. 112 and the Silvermine. Durum 
wheat is represented by Kubanka S.D. 75 and a pedi- 
greed variety selected from the Kubanka, Acme S.D, 284. 
Common spring wheat is almost exclusively Marquis or 
Preston procured from Canada. Swedish S.D. 348 and 
Dean S.D. 177 and a selection from Dean, the Advance 
S.D. 1030 are hardy varieties of winter rye. Grimm S.D. 
162 and common alfalfa grown in South Dakota for a 
long time are the most commonly grown and best adapted 
varieties of alfalfa. There is some Turkestan grown, but 
its popularity has not increased with that of the Grimm 
and the South Dakota Common. Cossack, a new variety, 
is proving hardy and becoming popular in some localities. 
White Spring emmer is the only variety of emmer grown. 
Tambov S.D. 80 is the best proso and Kursk S.D. 79 or a 
selection from Kursk known as Shelley S.D. 348 are the 
best adapted millets. Corn varieties have been intro- 
duced and developed by corn growers in nearly every 
section of the state. In the southeastern section A. J. 
Wimple has developed the Wimple's Yellow Dent, in the 
northwestern section the late Logan Slaughter has car- 
ried on the work of selecting and increasing the large 
strain of Squaw corn known as Slaughter's Squaw com. 
The Northwestern Dent variety has given a good account 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 319 

of itself in the entire northern section. In the central 
section the Minnesota 13 Yellow Dent and the Dakota 
White Dent are quite generally grown. 

Conclusions 

As a result of the introduction of hardy adapted crops 
and the increasing practice of crop rotation and diversi- 
fied farming in conection with the production of regis- 
tered and high grade live stock, the agriculture of South 
Dakota is rapidly getting upon a permanent basis and 
the prosperity of the state which depends entirely upon 
its agriculture has constantly increased. The state is 
growing rapidly in population. If a proper proportion 
of this population interests itself in farming so that the 
farm labor problem gradually becomes less acute, there 
is every reason to hope for a continuation of this pros- 
perity, due to increased farm production which can be 
attained' by the better farm practice that will be possible 
' with more help available. 

In making these statemicnts, we have tried to make it 
clear that successful crop production in this state does 
not depend upon any one minor practice, such as harrow- 
ing the growing crop, harrowing fall plowing, excessively 
deep plowing, packing or sub-soiling, but depends upon a 
continuation and combination of all good farm practices 
in connection with the use of good crop rotations and 
good seed of adapted varieties with requisite attention 
given to keeping up the fertility of the soil and improv- 
ing its physical condition by the addition of barnyard 
manure and the inclusion of clovers, alfalfas and similar 
crops in the rotation system. 



320 DRY FARMING 

DRY FARMING PRACTICE IN NORTH DAKOTA 

By W. R. Porter, Superintendent of Demonstration 
Farms for North Dakota. 

The term dry farming is usually eonsidered to include 
those types of farming that are practised in areas having 
less than twenty inches of annual rainfall. If this defini- 
tion is- correct parts of the Red River Valley in North 
Dakota and all the region west of the Red River Valley 
come within the dry farming area. 

The ability of the soil to hold moisture is probably a 
more important factor in the success or failure of a far- 
mer than the amount of rainfall annually received. Thirty 
inches of rainfall on a loam soil with a sand or gravel 
subsoil will probably not be as effective in producing 
crops as fifteen inches of rain on a loam soil having a 
clay subsoil. The place for summer tillage under North 
Dakota conditions is where the farms are too big to use 
all the corn or handle all the potato^ that might be 
produced if these crops were grown or where perennial 
weeds such as the sow thistle, and quack grass, have got 
a hold on the land. Summer tillage is the only method 
we have of combating these weeds. 

263. Summer Tillage. — Land which is to be summer 
tilled, particularly if infested with the above named 
weeds, should be plowed about 3 inches deep the latter 
part of October. This has two effects, it saves moisture 
and exposes the weed roots to more or less winter killing. 
The latter part of May or early in June this land should 
be plowed five to six inches deep and after that it should 
be cultivated at frequent intervals with the Spring Tooth 
Duck Foot Cultivator. 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 321 

The bare fallow has no place in a good system of crop 
rotation in North Dakota. The climate of North Dakota 
is a little too cold to grow sorghum. Corn, however, does 
well and as a feed crop it should always be used in pre- 
ference to summer tillage as it gives a good return in feed 
and the land is in just as good shape to produce a small 
grain crop the following year. 

Potatoes are a profitable crop and they leave the land 
in excellent condition for smjall grains. One acre of po- 
tatoes requires approximately as much labor as five acres 
of small grain and will probably give more than five 
times the return per acre. 

264. Stubble Land. — In the heavy soil areas stubble 
land should be plowed as soon after harvest as possible. 
This land should be packed with a subsurface packer 
or with a disc run straight, the day it is plowed. The 
next spring such land may either be disced or harrowed 
or both in order to make a compact fine seed bed. The 
important thing is to have the seed ]bed compact with a 
rather coarse mulch on the surface and not too smooth. 
Light soils should be left for spring- plowing. They 
should be subsurface packed and seeded the day they are 
plowed, if possible. Only rarely should the harrow be 
used on lighter, sandy soils in the spring. 

265. G-rass Land. — One of the best ways of utilizing 
grass land is to break in the spring, pack down level with 
a weighted disc or roller and disc until a fine mulch is 
on the surface and seed to flax. The other method is to 
break in the summer 'time and double-disc Car'ly the next 
spring, harrow until the seed bed is fine and seed to 
wheat. 

266. Rotations. — Profitable rotations require small 
grains, legumes and cultivated crops. The simplest pro- 



322 DRY FARMING 

fitable rotation of this character for North Dakota is po- 
tatoes or corn, seeded to wheat without plowing and with 
the wheat sow sweet clover. This would be a three-year 
rotation consisting of wheat, sweet clover, and com or 
potatoes. A longer and more practical rotation would be 
to have a field in each of corn, wheat, sweet clover, pota- 
toes, wheat, oats or barley, flax and one field seeded per- 
manently to alfalfa. 

In the dry region it is very important to maintain the 
organic matter of the soil as this constituent has great 
ability to hold moisture and prevent the soil from drift- 
ing. Legumes are necessary to keep up the nitrogen 
content of the soil and at the same time they furnish the 
best kind of feed for live stock which in turn helps to 
keep up the fertility of the soil and at the same time give 
a permanent income. 

267. The Best Crops.— The best varieties of wheat for 
the dry region are Marquis and the two Durums, Acme 
and Kubanka. Early varieties of oats should be used, 
such as the "Sixty-day'', Early Mountain, and Swedish 
Select. Of the mid-season varieties the Siberian White 
and the Lincoln are the best. One of the wilt-resistant 
varieties of flax should be used such as N.D. 114, 52 or 
155. The two-rowed bai'leys, such as Swan Neck and 
Hannschen are the most productive. The yellow variety 
of sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis) is probably a little 
superior to the white (Melilotus alba) variety. The 
Grimm is the only variety of alfalfa hardy enough for 
our conditions. Brome grass is the hardiest and most 
palatable grass. Western rye grass is also very good. 
Sunflowers may be used as an intertilled crop or as a 
substitute for corn as a silage crop, 

268. The Rate of Seeding.— In the drier part^ the rate 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 323 

of seeding should always be less than in humid sections. 
In western North Dakota three-fourths of a bushel of 
wheat is sufficient on most farms. One and one-fourth 
bushels of oats and barley are plenty to seed. 

269. Weeds are a great nuisance throughout the dry 
farming section. Wild oats is probably the worst of our 
annual weeds. The seed will not grow in the fall but 
readily grows and matures in fields of small grain. A 
good system of crop rotation is necessary to keep this 
weed in control. The Russian thistle is present every- 
where in the dry regions. In the wetter years it causes 
but little harm but in the dry seasons it often grows up 
and smothers crops and makes their harvesting difficult. 
It may be used for hay or silage and if fed with other 
feeds it has been found fairly nutritious. A good system 
of crop rotation is also very beneficial in holding this 
weed in check. 

2.70. Soil Drifting. — ^This sometimes causes the total 
destruction of crops. It is usually the result of the con- 
tinuous growing of small grains, particularly if alter- 
nated with summerfallow or summer tillage. Prevention 
of soil drifting is preferable to curing it after it starts. 
The growing of grass crops in the rotation and the re- 
turn of all the organic matter such as straw to the soil, 
in the form of manure and the leaving of the surface 
soil rough will prevent soil drifting. Where the soil is 
light and so deficient in organic matter that it drifts 
badly it should be spring plowed only. Strips of straw 
should be scattered over it at intervals and the surface 
of the soil should be left rough and the land seeded the 
same day it is plowed. 

Great care must be used in harrowing the growing 
crop. This practice usually makes the crop somewhat 



324 DRY FARMING 

later but it is effective in thinning out weeds, particularly 
those starting from small seeds such as mustard, buck- 
Wheat and pig weed. Harrowing should only be done 
with a light harrow on a firm soil after the crop is 5 or 
6 inches high and on a warm sunshiny day. Heavy soils 
should be harrowed immediately following the plow as 
this breaks up all the lumps and leaves a good surface 
mulch. 

Packing is best accomplished by using a disc set 
straight and going over the soil the day the land is 
plowed. The subsurface packer is also a good implement 
to use. Early after harvest disking probably is bene- 
ficial but it comes at a time when the labor supply on the 
farm is in great demand for other necessary operations. 
Plowing deeper than 6 inches probably does not pay. 

A farmer in the dry region should aim to get one-half 
of his income from live stock and live stock products. 
In the good years when he has an abundance of feed and 
straw, this should be carried over for the years of exces- 
sive drouth. This together with what he can produce by 
good cultivation will assure him a steady income even 
through the most adverse seasons. 

DRY FARMING IN MONTANA 

By Alfred Atkinson, President Montana State 

College of Agriculture. (Formerly 

Professor OF Agronomy). 

Dry farming in Montana has been practised in sections 
of the state for a long period of years and is now thor- 
oughly established. In the light of the experiences 
gained, the following stand out as the essential requisites 
which must be met if success is to be gained. 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE * 325 

271. Limited Supply of Moisture. — The conditions for 
crop growth in the dry farm sections are most favorable 
with one exception. The soils are rich in plant food and 
the temperatures are favorable, but the supply of mois- 
ture is below the amiount commonly considered necessary. 
A system must, therefore, be adjusted to make the most 
efficient use of the moisture present. The chief ways of 
doing this are conserving moisture by careful tillage and 
the selection of crops and the use of crop management 
methods that make the most economical use of moisture. 

The saving of a maximum amount of valuable moisture 
is important to insure plant growth and also to make 
available the plant food in the soil. Continuous cropping 
results in low yields, chiefly because the valuable plant 
food in the soil becomes used up. It is, therefore, neces- 
sary to make light moisture demand occasionally in the 
summer time in order that there may be heat, air and 
inoisture present to bring the plant food into condition 
to be used by growing crops. The common method of 
establishing these conditions is by means of the summer- 
fallow. In many sections, the tendency has been to sub- 
stitute cultivated crops, such as corn or sunflowers, in 
place of the fallow. Where careful tillage is followed, 
moisture may be conserved about as effectively in a corn 
fie'ld as in a bare fallow and the feed produced is m!ost 
valuable in maintaining and adding to the number of 
live stock kept. It, therefore, seems essential that the dry 
farm field should be fallowed or planted to an intertilled 
crop not less than two years in five. 

272. Early Maturing Crops. — In many dry farm sec- 
tions of the West, the heavy precipitation falls between 
the first of April and the 15th of July. Under this con- 
dition, it seems wise to plant crops that will make most 



326 DRY FARMING 

of their grrowth during this period and be far enough 
along to fill in good shape before the hot, dry weather 
starts in. Fall-sown wheat commonly matures early and 
the heads fill before the dry period. Such early maturing 
strains as the Marquis Wheat, the Sixty-Day Oats and 
the White Hulless Barley are rapidly growing spring 
strains and they should be used on the dry farm. The 
late maturing strains, which produce the heavy straw 
returns, commonly exhaust the moisture in the soil before 
the grains are developed and this means a light grain 
return. 

273. Light Seeding. — To economize the moisture pres- 
ent, light seeding should be practised. Under humid or 
irrigated conditions, two bushels of seed is a fair rate of 
planting, while on the dry farms, from three to four 
pecks has given better returns. The light seeding limits 
the straw production and carries more moisture over foi 
the maturing of the grain. 

The dry farmer, who would play safe, must have more 
than one source of income. Where land returns on the 
year's effort are all tied up in one grain crop, a dry sea- 
son has a very disastrous effect. Every dry farm should 
carry some live stock, so that the risk of the dry period 
is not so great. Even if forage may not be 'produced 
during the dry spell, the live stock may be sold to some 
extent and this will insure some income. Corn or Mam- 
moth Russian sunflowers, if carefully cultivated, give 
large silage returns, and with the winter and also the 
summer silo, the pasture shortage may be supplemented. 
Many successful dry farmers are filling one or more 
silos and carrying them over to feed during the follo,w- 
ing summer. This, as a pasture supplement, is most 
valuable.

Dry farming is not gambling on a wet season. It is 
so conducting the operations of the farm that there is 
fair prospect of returns every year. 

DRY FARMING PRACTICES IN THE RED RIVER 
VALLEY 

By T. J. Harrison, Professor of Field Husbandry, 
Manitoba Agricultural College, Winnipeg. 

The Province of Manitoba may be divided into three 
agronomic zones, i.e., Eastern, Southwestern and North- 
western, It is not possible at this time to state definitely 
the boundaries of these districts because no detailed 
climatic and soil survey has been made. The Eastern 
section or the Red River Valley may, however, be de- 
scribed as that portion occupying the basin of the old 
glacial lake Agassiz. It is approximately that part of 
the Province which lies between the 96th and 98th 
meridians, and south of the 51st degree of latitude. The 
Southwestern and Northwestern sections are west of the 
98th meridian and are separated a;pproximately by the 
50th degree of latitude. 

The fundamental differences in farming methods in 
these districts may be summarized as follows : — 

Southwestern: Except for the lack of moisture the 
climate in this district is favorable to the production of 
any of the small grain crops. The average annual pre- 
cipitation is only about 15 inches. The farm practices 
are, therefore, adapted to the conservation of moisture. 

Northwestern: In this portion of the province there 
are many variations in climate due to the mountains and 
lakes. The annual precipitation is about 18 inches. 
This with the cool climate and low evaporation is usually 



328 bRY FARMING 

sufficient moisture to produce good crops. The early fall 
frosts influence the type of farming more than moisture 
conservation; therefore, the growing of early ripening 
varieties and the use of methods of soil management 
that will induce early maturity are the general farm 
practices. 

Eastern or Red River Valley : The climate of this dis- 
trict is more favorable to crop production than that of 
any other portion of the Province. The annual precipi- 
tation is about 20 inches. A large amount of this moist- 
ure comes during the growing season and if not wasted 
is more than sufficient to produce maximum crops. With 
the standard varieties now in use on most farms there is 
practically no danger from fall frosts. The methods of 
farming are based as much upon the control of such 
factors as weeds, plant diseases and insects as they are 
upon the conservation of moisture. Fortunately, how- 
ever, methods that control weeds and insects are usually 
the same as methods that conserve moisture. 

274. The Place of the Bare Summerfallow in the Red 
River Valley. — Since the pioneer days when grain grow- 
ing became prevalent the summerfallow has been the 
popular method of preparing stubble land for crop. The 
piirpose of summerfallow is to prepare, during the slack 
season, a large acreage of land for crop and to conserve 
moisture. Before the advent of the perennial sow 
thistle the summerfallow was introduced into the rota- 
tion every fourth year. Since the control of this weed 
has become important it is now necessary in most in- 
stances to fallow every third year. Where this practice 
is followed profitable crops are ensured. 

275. Methods of Fallowing. — The methods of fallowing 
are determined quite as much by weeds and other factors 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 329 

as by the need of moisture. There are three methods 
practised although each has many modifications under 
different conditions. 

1st. Using cultivator only, 

2nd, Plowing in the fall and cultivating the follow- 
ing season, 

3rd. Plowing in the spring and cultivating the bal- 
ance of the season. 

In the first method cultivation is done by the use of 
the stiff-shank wide duck-foot cultivator. From five to 
eight cultivations are required during the season to 
eradicate perennial weeds. The work is started the last 
of May or the beginning of June and is repeated as fre- 
quently as necessary to keep the land black until freeze- 
up. The first stroke is necessarily shallow but the depth 
is increased each time until the final cultivation is five 
or six inches deep. This ensures the shares cleaning 
and thoroughly cutting off the roots of the perennial 
weeds. 

The second method consists of plowing the land five 
inches deep in the fall, and in the following year culti- 
vating with a duck-foot cultivator. Six cultivations are 
usually necessary to control the weeds. 

The third method with some modifications is the one 
that is in general use throughout the district. The land 
is plowed in June about six inches deep, and is cultivated 
three to six times afterwards to keep down the weeds. 
This method is often improved upon by either skim 
plowing or disking in the previous fall as soon as the 
crop is off the ground. This practice induces the germ- 
ination of the annual weed seeds in the fall and early 
spring. For fields infested with wild oats this method 
is to be commended. 



330 DRY FARMING 

276. Substitutes for Summerfallow. — Intertilled crops, 
such as corn, sunflowers and roots, can be grown in the 
Red River Valley for fodder every year with a fair 
degree of success. They leave the soil in a better con- 
dition for the succeeding crop of wheat than summer- 
fallow. The wheat crop has shorter straw and is, there- 
fore, less subject to rust. Sow thistle cannot be success- 
fully controlled by intertilling and the average farmer 
cannot utilize the crop from 80 to 100 acres of corn, 
sunflower or roots. While this method may be profitably 
practised on a limited acreage, it will never fully dis- 
place summerfallowing as long as the present system of 
grain farming is practised. 

277. Preparation of Stubble Land for Crop. — In pre- 
paring stubble land for crop it is conceded in the Red 
River Valley that fall plowing is necessary. It requires 
the mellowing effect of frost and moisture to put the 
heavy clay soil in condition for spring seeding. Spring 
plowing leaves the land so hard and rough that a seed 
bed cannot be made ; so if the land has not been plowed 
in the fall, cultivation in the spring will give better re- 
sults than plowing. This method of preparing stubble 
land "for crop without the use of the plow will give fair 
results if the land is clean, but as the average farm con- 
tains several kinds of noxious weeds this method cannot 
be recommended. 

278. Preparation of Grass Land for Crop. — In the pre- 
paration of grass land for crop the best results are ob- 
tained by breaking two or three inches deep in June or 
even later and back-setting five inches deep in Sep- 
tember. After the land is backset it should be packed 
and disked sufficient to keep down the weeds. Although 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 331 

this means the land is idle for the first year the succeed- 
ing crops will more than compensate for the loss. 

279. Rotations. — The question of the most profitable 
rotation is one that has not been conclusively answered, 
but is one that is now under close observation by many 
practical farmers and by the experiment stations. From 
the information on hand the following would seem to be 
the most profitable wherfe straight grain growing is fol- 
lowed :— 

1st Year — Summerfallow. 

2nd Year — Wheat. 

3rd Year — Oats and barley. 

Where mixed farming is followed the following ro- 
tation has given good results and with modifications to 
suit the needs of individual farmers is being adopted : — • 

1st Year — Fallow, corn, sunflowers and roots. 

2nd Year — Wheat seeded down to grass. 

3rd Year — Hay. 

4th Year — Pasture until after haying, then break and 
backset. 

5th Year — Wheat. 

6th ear — Oats and barley. 

280. Importance of Organic Matter in Soil. — The main- 
tenance of organic matter in the soil is essential to keep 
it friable and prevent baking. After a heavy rain the 
fibre-depleted soil bakes and cracks and much moisture 
is lost. In this district, with the exception of some of 
the lighter soils here and there, soil-drifting is not a 
problem. Within the last few years farmers throughout 
the valley have been making more use of farmyard man- 
ure and grass and clover crops for the purpose of main- 
taining the soil fibre and returning some plant food to 
the older soils. / 



332 DRY FARMING 

281. Crops. — In this district, wheat, oats, barley, rye, 
flax, grass, clover, corn and sunflowers are the crops that 
may be considered to give the best results. 

Wheat : This crop has been the main source of wealth 
in this district in the past. It will also continue to be 
the principal cash crop in the future unless the ravages 




Fig. 102. — Sunflowers for Silage, Agricultural College, Winnipeg. 

of rust make its production unprofitable. At the pres- 
ent time 95% of the wheat grown is of the Marquis 
variety. The remainder is made up of Red Fife and 
otlier less-known strains, such as Red Bobs and 
Kitchener. Durum Wheat, of which Kubanka is the 
chief variety, is also being grown. The Red Fife is later 
maturing than the Marquis, and, therefore, is more sub- 
ject to rust. The Red Bobs is somewhat earlier but does 
not yield nearly so well. The Kitchener matures about 
the same time as Marquis but on the heavy clay soils 
gives a poorer yield. The Durum wheats are of more 
recent introduction. If a ready market can be found 
for this type and if they prove to be rust-resistant they 
may become more popular. 

Oats : This crop does not thrive so well in this district 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 333 

as in the Northwestern. For that reason it is not con- 
sidered one of the important cash crops. It is, however, 
largely grown for feed purposes; part of the crop is 
threshed and part used for cured fodder in the sheaf. 
Less attention has been paid to the varieties of this 
crop, and in nearly every municipality there will be 
found as many as ten to fifteen different sorts. The 
results at the experiment station, however, indicate that 
the three best varieties are Banner, Gold Rain and 
Victory. 

Barley : The soil of the Red River Valley seems well 
adapted for the production of this crop. This, coupled 
with the fact, that it can be used for weed control, be- 
cause of its early maturing habit, makes it one of the" 
cash crops that is receiving more and more attention each 
year. Its main use, however, as yet is for hog and cattle 
feed. The three best varieties are 0. A. C. 21, Manchur- 
ian and Mensury. 

Flax : Where conditions are favorable excellent flax 
crops are produced. Flax, however, is considered one of 
the new land crops, and as a large percentage of the 
land has been brought under cultivation, this crop is not 
being grown to as great an extent as in the past. The 
average farmer has paid very little attention to varieties 
of flax. The most common variety grown is Premost, 
while some of the wilt resistant strains from the North 
Dakota Experiment Station are also on the market. 

Rye : A limited amount of winter and spring rye is 
produced. The difficulty with winter killing has pre- 
vented the winter sort becoming more common. Spring 
rye has given such a small average yield that it has not 
displaced aily of the three foregoing cereals. Because of 



334 DRY FARMING 

the small amount of this crop grown there are no var- 
ieties being recognized by the farmers. 

Grasses : With the introduction of weeds and the need 
for diversification of crops more attention has been given 
each year to grasses. Timothy remains the most popu- 
lar, largely because of the cheapness of the seed and its 
popularity in the Eastern Provinces and the States. 
Western Rye, Meadow Fescue and Brome are grown in 
limited quantities. 

Legumes: Little attention has been paid to legumes, 
but where they have been tried out Alfalfa and Sweet 
Clover seem to give best results, while in most years the 
common Red Clover and Alsike can be grown with a fair 
degree of success. This is especially true east of the 
Red River. 

Intertilled Crops: As mentioned previously, fodder 
corn, sunflowers and roots are the intertilled crops that 
are grown in this district. The root crops have never 
come into favor because of the expense in handling and 
the amount of hand labor necessary. A five- to ten-acre 
patch of fodder corn is quite common on the farms 
throughout the district; where there is a silo a greater 
acreage is grown. The success with sunflowers as silage 
has displaced corn on some of the larger farms. The 
varieties of corn usually grown are Northwestern Dent 
and Minnesota No. 13. So far Mammoth Russian is the 
sunflower that is being used. 

282. Rate of Seeding.— The rate of seeding with practi- 
cally all crops is much heavier in this section than in 
most of the Great Plains Area. This is due to the com- 
paratively heavy precipitation and the need to crowd 
out all other plants. Wheat is sown at the rate of a 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 335 

bushel and three-quarters per acre, oats — two and one- 
half to three bushels per acre, barley — two to two and a 
half bushels per acre, and all other crops at an equally 
heavy rate. 

283. Dates of Seeding. — Experience has shown, other 
things being equal, that the earlier the crop, the heavier 
the yield as it is less liable to insect damage and plant 
diseases. Wheat should be sown as soon as the land can 
be worked; oats and barley about the first week after 
the land is fit for cultivation. Grasses and clovers are 
usually sown sometime between the 15th of May and the 
15th of June ; sunflowers during the month of May, and 
corn between May 20th and June 10th, 

284. Weeds, Plant Diseases and Insects. — These are the 
three factors that cause the greatest loss throughout the 
district. Among the most pernicious weeds are peren- 
nial sow thistle, wild oats, Canada thistle, French weed 
and wild mustard. The plant diseases that have taken 
the greatest toll from the farmers are rust, smut and 
wHt. The insects are cut-worms, western saw-fly and 
grasshoppers. 

Conclusion 

The successful farmers of the Eastern zone are those 
who have selected suitable crops and varieties and have 
adapted their farming practices to the control of weeds, 
plant diseases and insects. Incidentally these practices 
conserve moisture but this has not been the primary con- 
sideration. The use of the bare fallow and other farm- 
ing practices mentioned above have produced profitable 
crops practically every year in the Red River Valley, 



336 DRY FARMING 

• DRY FARMING IN WESTERN MANITOBA 

By W. C. McKillican, Superintendent Experimental 
Farm, Brandon, Man. 

The average precipitation for the ten years, 1911-1919, 
at Brandon, Manitoba, was 16.33 inches. The area whicl] 
this represents is therefore of a semi-arid character and 
farm practices which conserve soil moisture and utilize 
it to the greatest degree are necessary for success in 
agriculture. 

SUMMERP ALLOW. 

285. Importance of the Fallow. — The corner stone oj 
dry farming in Western Manitoba is the summerfallo'w 
and so is it likely to continue for many years. Grair 
crops have enjoyed almost a monopoly of crop raising 
and the summerfallow has served to clean the land, tc 
conserve the moisture from one year to another and in 
deed has made grain growing possible in the pioneer anc 
exploration stages of the country's development. 

286. Methods of Fallowing. — The main features of i 
good summerfallow as practised in this region are earlj 
plowing and thoroughness of after-cultivation. Botl 
of these derive their importance from their efficacy ir 
preventing the loss of moisture through weed growth 
By early plowing we mean the first half of the montl 
of June. May plowing has given no advantage ovei 
June but June has a very decided advantage over July 
Depth of plowing is also generally believed to be ar 
important feature of good summerfallowing. I believ( 
this is usually correct, though our experimental results ai 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 337 

Brandon have not corroborated this opinion. In the con- 
trol of annual weeds one plowing followed by bare 
cultivation is better than two, but where couch grass or 
other persistent perennials are to be fought two plow- 
ings are justified. 

The best implement for the cultivation of summer- 
fallows is the stiff-tooth, duck-foot cultivator. Disc har- 
rows and drag harrows should be used very sparingly if 
at all. Only in exceptionally loose, soddy or lumpy land 
is the use of the packer justified. A very full set of 
experiments at Brandon show no returns from its use. 

287. Dangers of Fallowing. — The dangers of summer 
fallowing are soil exhaustion and soil drifting. It 
makes no provision for the return of plant food. This 
result (loss of fertility) has not been felt as yet in Man- 
itoba, but it is something that plans for the future must 
take cognizance of. Soil drifting is here and is perhaps 
the biggest difficulty in Western Manitoba farming to- 
day. The grain and summerfallow system of the past 
must be modified to control it. 

288. Substitutes for Summerfallow. — Corn is the best 
substitute for the summerfallow. It should not be used 
in very dirty fields as the cost of cleaning is too great. 
The crop of grain produced on a well cultivated corn 
field will usually equal and often exceed that on sum- 
merfallow. 

Other intertilled crops such as mangels, turnips, po- 
tatoes or sunflowers, may also be used in the same way 
as corn, but none are so satisfactory as corn so far as 
effectiveness as a substitute for fallow is concerned. 

A pastured fallow is sometimes substituted for bare 
cultivation. It is not satisfactory in the real farming 
districts; the pasture crop uses too much moisture, and 



338 



DRY FARMING 



if there are perennial weeds, persistent cultivation is 
necessary to kill them. 

Hay crops may be used as a partial substitute for 
summerf allow. For this method to be successful the sod 
must be plowed early so as to be well rotted and to 
provide for the accumulation of moisture. At the best 
there will not be as much moisture conserved as in a bare 
fallow but practical results have been satisfactory and it 
is only by the use of sod-forming crops that the soil 
drifting menace can be overcome. 

Rotations. 



289. Kotations now in Use. — The standard rotation 
generally in u^se in the western part of Manitoba is sum- 




rig. 103.

mental Farm. 



merfallow and three crops of grain. Wheat practically 
always follows the summerfallow, the second year after 
fallow being sometimes wheat and sometimes oats and 
the third year oats or barley. In the early grain grow- 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 339 

ing years on a fertile soil this was found to be very satis- 
factory. The summerfallow once in four years was 
found to be sufficient to conserve moisture and keep the 
weeds at least partly in check. This rotation with 
modifications represents most of the farming in this 
region. However as has already been indicated soil 
drifting is proving its inadequacy for a permanent sys- 
tem, and the great increase in weeds also indicates the 
need of a change. 

290. Improvements in Rotation. — These 'have been indi- 
cated generally in discussing substitutes for summer- 
fallow. Greater diversity of crop is needed, including, 
first a sod-forming hay crop to return fibre to the soil 
and make feed for live stock which will result in manure. 
Second, the use of corn or other inter-tilled crop to pro- 
vide additional live stock fodder and to cheapen the 
cost of production of wheat. Third, fall rye may be 
needed to control soil drifting where it is so bad that 
grasses could not be started. A practical rotation which 
combines these features is as follows : 

1st Year — "Wheat. 

2nd Year — Oats. 

3rd Year — Summerfallow and partly corn. 

4th Year — Wheat or, if necessary. Fall Rye, seeded 
down with grasses and clovers. 

5th Year — Hay. 

6th Year — Hay or pasture plowed up in midsummer 
or earlier, and prepared for wheat. 

This rotation has one half the land in grain crops, one 
sixth in hay, one sixth in hay or pasture for the early 
part of the season and afterwards fallow, and one sixth 
in summerfallow and corn. The seeding down to grasses 
is on summerfallow or corn land which is the only 



340 DRY FARMING 

place to insure a catch. The wheat which is our main 
crop is given the two most advantageous years in the six. 

This rotation is offered as a practical suggestion, which 
may be altered to suit varying conditions. 

290a. Dry Farming Crops, — 

Wheat : — The effect of shortage of moisture on a crop 
is to make it sacrifice leaf and stem for the development 
of the seed. Dry areas are consequently best fitted for 
the production of seed-bearing crops. Wheat is the 
great seed-bearing crop of Manitoba. Wheat made Mani- 
toba, and will continue to be its chief support for many 
years to come. The object of diversification of crops, 
introduction of new crops and live stock raising is not 
to replace wheat, but rather to make the continuation 
of profitable wheat growing possibile, where an attempt 
to grow nothing but wheat is suicide for wheat growing. 

Marquis is at the time of writing (1920) the best 
variety of wheat for Manitoba. Red Fife has been en- 
tirely replaced and rightly so. Red Bobs has had a 
somewhat sensational period of advertising but is prov- 
ing distinctly inferior. Kubanka, a durum variety, is 
being introduced to some extent on account of drought 
resistance and supposed immunity from rust. Its low 
milling value makes it distinctly undesirable unless rust 
should become so bad as to make the growing of Marquis 
or other white-flour-producing wheats impossible. Ruby 
is a new variety somewhat earlier than Marquis and of 
similar quality which has not been fully tried out, but 
may be of importance for northern districts. 

Oats. — Oats fill an important place in Manitoba farm- 
ing. The IBanner and Victory varieties are the leading 
favorites. 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 341 

Barley. — Manchurian and 0. A. C. No. 21 both six- 
rowed varieties, are the best in use at present. 

Fall Rye. — Fall Rye has been used to some extent as 
a means of controlling soil-drifting and combating wild 
cats and is proving very valuable for these purposes. 

Corn. — The great value of corn in a crop rotation has 
already been mentioned. Northwestern Dent and Min- 
nesota No. 13, are good varieties for this territory. 

Sunflowers. — Sunflowers have been proven to be a. 
good silage crop and can fill the place of corn where it 
does not succeed. 

Mangels and Turnips. — Are not extensively grown but 
can be grown successfully. 

Grasses. — Brome grass is our most drouth-resistant 
grass and is used to quite a degree for permanent hay 
and pasture. Its persistence makes it undesirable where 
more easily handled grasses will succeed. Western Rye 
grass is probably the most generally useful grass for this 
territory. It stands drought well, yields almost as well 
as brome grass and being easily plowed up is a better 
rotation grass. Timothy is too dependent on moisture 
and the same is true of all grasses commonly grown in 
humid countries. 

Leguminous Hay Crops. — Alfalfa is the most valuable 
of these. It is grown with great success at Brandon Ex- 
perimental Farm and by some few private farmers but 
is generally considered throughout this region as im- 
possible to grow successfully. I believe the future will 
see it grown very much more generally, and that it will 
contribute very largely to the solution of farming prob- 
lems. Sweet clover is being introduced to a consider- 
able degree and has a great value where alfalfa cannot 
be grown. Its productiveness, hardiness, free seeding 



342 DRY FARMING 

and adaptability give it a great value as a pioneer 
leguminous crop, but its coarseness and short life lessen 
its value. Red clover is only grown successfully in 
limited areas an)d can hardly be recommended for gen- 
eral use ; the same is true of Alsike. Neither of these are 
really dry farming crops. 

DRY FARMING PRACTICES IN THE PARK BELT 
OF ALBERTA 

By G. H. Hutton, B.S.A., Superintendent op Agri- 
culture AND Animal Industry, CP.R., Calgary. 

291. The Place of the Suniiiierf allow. — As a general 
proposition it is not necessary to summerfallow in Central 
Alberta. The average precipitation during the year is 
in the neighbourhood of seventeen inches, sixty per cent, 
of which falls during the growing months. Other con- 
ditions than the amount of rainfall influence crops, such 
a,s the kind of soil on which the rain falls, its depth, and 
character of subsoil, velocity of prevailing wind, and 
amount of protection against such winds afforded by 
trees. The soil in the Park Belt of Alberta is a heavy 
black loam as much as three or four feet deep in many 
places, resting on a clay subsoil; there is therefore, 
practically no loss of moisture below, while the rate of 
evaporation is slow because of the fact that wind is not 
a serious factor to be reckoned with, also the large 
amount of humus in the soil holds the moisture ten- 
aciously. Under such conditions a summerfallow stores 
such a large amount of moisture and liberates such a high 
percentage of nitrogen that the following crop lodges 
ninety per cent, of the time, fails to fill well, and is dif- 
ficult to harvest.

343 



292. Suitable Rotation for the Park Belt.— A rotation 
which has given excellent results is as follows : — 

1st Year. — Hay; manure during winter, 12 tons per 
acre. 

2nd Year. — Pasture. 

3rd Year.— Pasture to July or early August, plow- 
ed 6 inches deep and cultivated. 




Fig. 104. — Alsike Clover and Timothy, Lacombe, Alta. 



4th Year. — Wheat or oats. 
5th Year. — Oats. 
6th Year. — Barley seeded down. 

As a rule a first-class stand of timothy and alsike or 
red clover combinations can be obtained when seeded 



344 DKY FARMING 

down with a nurse crop of barley. The land is cleaned 
to some extent by means of the cultivation given after 
the sod is plowed in the third year of the rotation, 
while the manure applied in the winter of the first year 
to the surface of the sod maintains fertility, and the 
weed seeds contained therein are largely destroyed prior 
to the plowing of the land in the third year of the 
rotation. On account of the liberal rainfall in May or 
June weed seeds germinate near the surface and in the 
manure, but lack sufficient roothold to come to ma- 
turity, and are thus destroyed. Such a rotation has re- 
sulted in the freeing of land from weeds to a remarkable 
extent, and has also built the land up as to fertility to a 
noticeable degree- 

293. Corn vs, the Fallow. — Corn has been tested for 
some years in Central Alberta with rather indifferent 
success. During only about half of the years, has it 
given a crop which could be called profitable, and the 
risk thus indicated is too great to warrant the general 
use of this crop in that part of the country. It is ad- 
mitted that an intertilled crop would be an advantage if 
it were practical in a large way, and economical use 
could be made of the fodders grown. The sunflower may 
prove to be a plant which can be utilized in this section 
of the country to good advantage because it resists frost 
better than corn, and from the data at hand would ap- 
pear to be superior to corn. When the size of farms 
reaches a better balance in relation to the amount of 
labor available this intertilled crop will command 
much more attention, and can be used to splendid ad- 
vantage in conjunction with silos. Such use of crops 
suitable for ensilage and of silos will result in doubling 
the stock-carrying capacity of land. 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 345 

294. The Preparation of Stubble Land for the Crop 
Following. — If time permits, stubble land should be 
plowed six inches deep in the fall and plowing oper- 
ations should be followed immediately by the use of a 
soil packer, or if this implement is not available, by the 
drag harrow or disc. Such practice closes the air space 
in the land, and prevents the loss of moisture through 
the circulation of air. The use of a packer immediately 
following the plow also permits of fall germination of 
weed seeds by firming the soil near the freshly turned 
surface, thus permitting the movement of moisture to 
these seeds. Packing promptly after the plow is an 
effective cultivation in preparing the land for work the 
next spring, as it levels as well as firms the soil. Such 
land, well plowed and double-disked after the packer, 
is in good condition for the grain drill in the black loam 
soil of this section of the West. 

295. Preparation of Grass Land for the Crop Fol- 
lowing. — As indicated in the previous paragraph the 
plowing of grass land in July or early August is ad- 
vised. The depth should be six inches and the plow 
should be followed by the packer or by the disc harrow 
operated in the same direction as the plow. As soon as 
convenient after the packer the land should be given a 
double disking, after which it may remain for some time 
without further cultivation. It is advisable, however, to 
give such land the necessary work in the fall so that it 
will not require much more than drag harrowing, or a 
double disking and drag harrowing at most, the follow- 
ing spring, in order to insure a good seed-bed. 

296. Organic Matter, Legumes and Soil. — The import- 
ance of organic matter in the soil is shown by the wonder- 
ful crops which it is possible to grow when the virgin 



346 DRY FARMING 

prairie is first broken. Such fertility is the result of the 
decayed organic matter of generations of plant growth, 
and its presence insures yields of as much as seventy 
bushels of wheat to the acre and one hundred and forty 
bushels of oats. Such rich soils will produce profitable 
crops with light rainfall, as compared with the possi- 
bilities of poorer land with the same precipitation. No 
permanent system of agriculture can be maintained 
which disregards the maintenance of soil fertility 
through the use of barnyard manure and leguminous 
crops. It is quite possible to exhaust the fertility and to 
make barren, lan^ds which, with ordinary good farming 
practice could be maintained in a splendidly high state 
of fertility. The ease with which alsike clover, red clover 
and other clovers can be grown with a nurse crop in 
Central Alberta, and the natural adaptability of the 
country for live stock should insure for this district 
perpetual resources of fertility in the land if any 
semblance of sane agriculture is followed. 

297. Best Dry Farm Crops. — Cereals, legumes and 
grasses thrive. As to varieties. Marquis wheat, Banner 
or Victory oats; Mensury, O.A.C. 21 and Barks barley; 
alsike, red clover, alfalfa in some districts, sweet clover 
in some districts, and Giant Russian Sunflowers ; tinuothy 
Western rye, and brome grass, are all suitable for dif- 
ferent parts of the country. 

298. Rates of Seeding in Central Alberta. — As a general 
practice rather heavy seeding is advisable for the Park 
Belt in Alberta, The proper rate to sow, of course, de- 
pends upon the variety of grain, which involves size of 
kernel and the kind and condition of the land on which 
the grain is to be sown. Breaking and summerfallow 
Well supplied with moisture will carry from one-half to 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 347 

one bushel more seed per acre than stubble land equally 
well cultivated. It has been found advisable to sow 
from two to three bushels of spring wheat per acre on 
well-cultivated breaking or summerfallow, depending 
upon the character of the land and its location, reducing 
the amount of seed on stubble land by half a bushel to a 
bushel, again depending upon condition. Oats should 
be seeded at the rate of from two and a half to three 
bushels per acre; barley at about two bushels per acre; 
sunflowers about ten pounds, and grasses and legumes at 
various rates according to the combinations used. As a 
rule it is advisable to sow from twelve to fifteen pounds 
of Western Rye grass to the acre when this is the only 
variety being used, and this may be used as the basis 
for determining other mixtures. 

299. Weeds. — The eradication of weeds, while a serious 
problem, is not as acute a question in Central Alberta as 
in districts where wind has more sweep, and where the 
varieties of weeds have adjusted themselves to these con- 
ditions and spread over the whole territory by means of 
wind. The disking of stubble land following the binder, 
the following of the plow with the packer to encourage 
germination of seed; giving the land a stroke with the 
drag harrow as early in the spring as it is possible to 
work the soil, and the drag harrowing of the growing 
crop, together with the fall cultivation of July plowed 
sod, will gradually reduce the weed population of a foul 
farm, and will keep a clean farm clean. 

300. Soil Drifting. — The drifting of soil will never be 
a serious problem in Central Alberta provided methods 
outlined in the paragraphs immediately preceding are 
followed. The use of barnyard manure, the seeding down 



348 DRY FARMING 

of land to grass, and the growing of such big-rooted 
plants as a number of the legumes are, will all assist in 
solving this problem before it arises, and it might be said 
in passing that this is the time to solve such a problem. 
The reclaiming of all soil which has been allowed to reach 
the drifting stage is a serious matter, and the said condi- 
tion should be avoided by every serious-minded, thinking 
farmer as he would avoid a plague. The following of the 
practice which will lead to the avoidance of the difficulty 
will also prove more profitable than those farming prac- 
tices which lead to the soil-drifting condition. 

301. Plowing. — Grood plowing is one of the most, if 
not the most important cultural operation on the farm. 
If this work is well done the battle is half won. Deep 
plowing is advisable in most cases, and in my judgment 
should never be less than six inches. Deep plowing of 
breaking is important, not only to permit of a good seed- 
bed being worked after breaking without the necessity 
of backsetting, which is not feasible in the Park Belt, 
but is also necessary in areas where there is much wil- 
low or other growth of tree roots to be turned down. The 
breaking plow must cut under these roots. Where the 
ground is very rich it is advisable to disc in the second 
crop on the stubble allowing more time for roots to rot. 
The deep plowing of stubble land provides a greater 
reservoir for the storing of moisture, and a better oppor- 
tunity for plants to develop roots. The importance of 
taking pride in the various operations in connection with 
farm work cannot be overstated. The doing of work well 
is the only thing which will lift farm work from being a 
mere job to an interesting home-building occupation.

THE SUMMERF ALLOW IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA 

By James Murray, B.S.A., Superintendent of Farms, 
Noble Foundation Limited, Nobleford, Alberta. 

302. Climate. — The climate of Southern Alberta is 
characterized by light rainfall, — about fifteen inches, — 
and the prevalence of chinook winds which blow inter- 
mittently throughout the year. The chinook frequently 
attains the proportions of a galej in winter it carries 
away a heavy snowfall in a few hours, and in spring and 
summer, and also frequently in winter, it not only dries 
out the surface soil very rapidly, but carries away in 
dust storms any soil in condition to blow readily. On 
account of these conditions — light precipitation and 
heavy winds, — ^the Southern Alberta farmer on dry land 
must keep always before him the need of conserving as 
much as possible of the moisture and of so working his 
land that it does not readily blow. 

303. A Fallow Considered Necessary. — The general 
practice on* the farms of the Noble Foundation Limited 
is to summerfallow one half of the land each year. This 
is departed from more or less every year, as feed oats is 
frequently grown on land that was in crop the previous 
year; but only in very favorable seasons does the yield 
approach that from summerfallow. In dry seasons the 
yield from such land is very low. Over a series of years 
the further we depart from the method of fallowing one 
half each year the less satisfactory are the results. With 
most of the crop grown on summerfallow a fair return 
is secured even in a poor year, and an excellent crop in 
a good year. 

304. Summerfallow to Control Weeds. — The method 
followed in summerfallowing is planned to control weeds 



350 DRY FARMING 

since most of the moisture lost during a fallow season is 
by the growth of weeds. The land to be summerfallowed 
is sometimes double-disked in the fall after the crop is 
removed, but more frequently, on account of lack of time 
in the fall, this operation is delayed until spring when 
it is done either during the progress of seeding or im- 
mediately after. This disking covers weed seeds and 
grain so that they grow readily. It kills millions of 
small weeds just starting and it breaks up the crust and 
leaves a light mulch on t^e surface. Such a surface makes 
a much better connection with the bottom of the furrow 
when the land is plowed than one that is hard, cracked 
and lumpy. In some seasons it may be advisable in order 
to control weeds to disc a second time any land that is 
not plowed reasonably early, but usually one double- 
disking is sufficient. 

305. Plow Summerfallow Early. — The plowing of the 
summerfallow is started immediately after seeding and 
an effort made to have it completed before July. No 
single operation in summerfallowing is so important as 
plowing, so that care is taken to do the work well, turn- 
ing a furrow of from six to eight inches deep depending 
upon how deep the land was plowed previously. Only a 
little subsoil is brought to the surface at each plowing. 
Immediately after plowing the land is packed by using 
either a subsurface packer or a disc run straight or one 
notch back. The packing is more perfectly done when the 
land is fresh-plowed, so that an effort is made to have 
the packing done the same day as the plowing. 

306. Controlling Weeds After Plowing. — After the 
plowing and packing of the fallow is done little more 
attention will need to be given for three weeks or a month 
when weeds begin to appear. A start must be made at 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 



351 




352 DRY FARMING 

destroying the weeds when they are very small, else 
many of them will be large and have made a heavy draft 
on the moisture before they have been all killed. The 
implement used almost exclusively during the first two 
seasons as a weed destroyer in the fallow is the Rotary 
Rod Weeder. For several years previously a stationary 
rod weeder was used, but since the weeder with the re- 
volving rod has been tried, the other one has been dis- 
carded. The Rotary Rod Weeder destroys all the weeds 
if it is used before they are too large, and leaves the land 
with a rough surface, not likely to blow. In some seasons 
it will be necessary to go over the fallow twice with the 
weeder to control weed growth, but the amount of work 
given is governed entirely by conditions. If weeds make 
their appearance and are likely to attain any size they 
should be destroyed. 

307. Fall Treatment of Fallow.— The final operation on 
the fallow in the fall should be such as will leave it in a 
condition to best withstand heavy winds during the 
winter. Ridging with either a cultivator or a spring 
tooth harrow across the direction of the general winds is 
a good practice. The ridges not only serve to catch any 
soil that starts to shift, but they catch and hold light 
snowfalls that are frequently swept off fields that have a 
smooth surface. By removing two-thirds of the teeth 
from the spring tooth harrow so that the ridges are one 
foot wide the draft is lightened and the work more ef- 
fectively done at the same time. 

308. Hoe Drill Preferred. — The hoe drill has been given 
a fairly good trial during the past two years and since 
it leaves the land much rougher than the other types of 
drills, it will probably come into fairly general use in 
districts where soil-drifting is particularly troublesome. 



LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE 



353 



When the hoe drill has been used on land not likely to 
drift, harrowing is advisable after sowing, but if drift- 
ing is feared the harrow had best be dispensed with. 

309. Two Important Points About Fallowing. — In all 
the work on the summerf allow it is particularly im- 
portant that two points be bornO' in mind, — the killing 
of weeds when they are small and the use of implements 
that will not pulverize the surface. The only safe time 
to use the disc harrow is before the land is plowed, — at 
other times it tends to pulverize too much. The drag 
harrow must, for the same reason, be used with great 
caution and drags of any kind that grind the surface 
should not be used on any account.

CHAPTER XVII 
THE PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 

The control of crop yields and the maintenance of soil 
productiveness are problems that directly affect the 
prosperity of both the individual and the state. 

An increase in net return equal in value to one bushel 
of wheat per acre on the land at present under cultiva- 
tion in Western Canada would, at $1.00 per bushel, pay 
the whole cost of the general expenditure for purposes 
of government of the three Prairie Provinces. The same 
increase per acre per year for six years would more than 
pay Western Canada's share of the Great War debt. 

An increase in net return equal to one bushel of wheat 
per acre would mean that approximately $35,000,000 ad- 
ditional cash would be available for that section of the 
community engaged in supplying the needs of the farmer 
and in distributing his products — the commercial and in- 
dustrial interests; while a decrease of one bushel per 
acre would mean that an equally large amount of mort- 
gages, loans and notes would remain unpaid foi: at least 
an additional year. 

310. The Problem in a Nutshell. — If one bushel per 
acre or more of an increase is to be obtained or even if one 
bushel or more decrease is to be prevented, the men who 
control our great resource, viz., the soil, must know : 

354 



PROBLEM OP CROP PRODUCTION 355 

(1) The factors that are essential to the growth of 
crops ; 

(2) The factors that affect the profit of crop produc- 
tion; and 

(3) The factors that affect the permanence of a profit- 
able agriculture. 

And they must not only know, hut they must also put 
into practice, the means at their disposal for controlling 
or influencing the factors of growth, profit and perman- 
ence. 

A statement and brief discussion of the fundamental 
principles underlying crop production, has seemed to us 
essential to a proper appreciation of the subject, both by 
the producer and the student of agricultural affairs. In 
this chapter we have, therefore endeavored to bring to- 
gether the various phases of the question in such a way 
that the reader may get a general view, even though a 
brief one, of the relationship of its different parts to 
each other and to the problem as a whole, 

311. The First Part of the Problem— That of Growing 
Crops. — As previously mentioned* the factors that must 
be provided before plants can grow are : 

(1) The seed — which contains the life principle, the 
reproductive part. 

(2) Plant food materials — the chemical elements of 
soil, water and air that are available to plants and that 
are necessary for growth. 

(3) "Water — a plant food itself and also a carrier of 
elements of plant food from the soil to the plant. 

(4) Heat — without which the life process of the plant, 
germination and growth, cannot go on. 

*In Chapter III.

(5) Light— for the synthesis or building up, in the 
leaves, of organic compounds from the inorganic elements 
of plant food. 

(6) Air — which not only supplies a large part of the 
food of plants, but which in small quantity in the soil

provides a desirable environment for plant roots and at 
the same time plays a large part in the development of 
"available" plant food. 

Fortunately for us nature provides most of these re- 
quirements with a lavish hand. It remains for man to 
increase, or at least maintain the supply of those that 
under his own climatic and soil conditions have been 
either wasted or but sparingly supplied. 

312. Light and Air Essential, but of Little Practical 
Importance. — Light and air are as important to the plant 
as plant food, water or heat, yet neither is as important 
to the crop grower for the reason that he finds both pro- 
vided in very great abundance. More light than reaches 
the earth in most climates where agriculture is practised, 
is seldom needed, and even if it were, the amount could 
not be increased profitably. ' _ 



PROBLEM OP CROP PRODUCTION 357 

Nature supplies plenty of air above ground and in all 
except humid climates, low lying soils, or very heavy 
lands sufficient in the soil as well. It is our business only 
to regulate the supply so that the soil will contain 
neither too much nor too little, but just the right amount 
for good tilth. 

313. Frost Limits the Yield in Northern Climates. — The 
average number of days between spring and fall frosts 
for a period of twelve years in the Central "West varies 
from 73 in the north to 133 in parts of the south. The 
shortest period between frosts during the same length of 
time was 33 days for the north and 101 for the south 
while the longest frost-free period in each of these dis- 
tricts was 112 and 163 days respectively. These figures 
probably represent the extremes in length of frost-free 
period for most of the present settled area of Western 
Canada. 

It is apparent from these data as well as from actual 
experience that in northern climates nature sometimes 
fails to provide enougb heat to mature crops without in- 
jury from law temperature, and that, therefore, man 
must either add to the supply or take such steps as will 
offset the danger from frost. This is one of the two 
chief difficulties facing the crop grower in Western Can- 
ada. There is need for developing a system of "North- 
ern Farming" for northern regions just as there is a 
need for a system of "Dry Farming" for dry regions or 
one of "Humid Farming" for wet ones. 

314. Water in the Soil Determines the Yield in Dry 
Climates. — Water is generally the limiting factor in crop 
production here. In other words, it is the chief cause o^ 
low yields. From 250 to 1,000 pounds of moisture are 
extracted from the soil and transpired by the plant into 



358 DRY FARMING 

the air in the process of forming one pound of dry 
organic matter in the plants' tissues. In Western Can- 
ada we receive from 12 to 22 inches of water from the 
clouds annually. The precipitation in most agricultural 
countries ranges between 10 inches and 150 inches per 
year. Our supply is small and our need is great. Man 
must make the best use of what nature supplies or 
furnish artificially the shortage, otherwise he must be 
content with low yields. 

In humid regions the supply of moisture from the 
clouds is generally sufficient to produce large returns. 
In arid and semi-arid climates there is insufficient rain- 
fall to produce large crops every year with the result 
that the supply of water must be increased by irrigation 
or steps must be taken to store a portion of one season's 
moisture in the soil for the use of the next season's crop, 
as by summerfallowing, or the use of intertilled crops. 

The efficient utilization of our precipitation for the 
development of the latent wealth that is in our soil is the 
biggest material problem Western Canada has to face. 
She has made some progress towards its solution, but 
much work still remains to be done. 

315. Plant Food Materials, the Limiting Factor on Poor 
Soils. — Of the eighty odd chemical elements known to 
science, fifteen may be used by plants, but only ten are 
essential to growth, and of these ten, all but four — nitro- 
gen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium — are provided 
in liberal quantity in the soil. The available supply of 
one or more of these essential elements of plant food is 
sometimes so small in humid climates that large yields 
on poor soils are an impossibility. Under these condi- 
tions the terms "'manure" and "fertilizer" are therefore 
almost synonymjous with soil fertility, and the chief 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 359 

problem of the crop grower is to maintain the supply of 
available plant food in the soil. 

In Western Canada our normal soils are rich. The 
total supply of the chemical elements essential to plant 
growth is relatively large — so large in fact that on many 
soil types we are permitting ourselves to neglect almost 
wholly the question of its conservation. Our immediate 
problem is one of development rather than conservation. 
Nevertheless, it should be possible for us to do what older 
agricultural countries have done, viz., conserve our soil 
resources while still developing them. The maintenance 
of soil productiveness is likely ultimately to become one 
of our most serious problems and it would therefore seem 
to be the part of wisdom to direct more of our energies 
and resources toward the early solution of this difficult 
question. 

316. The Importance of Good Seed. — The seed we sow 
may be good or poor. Its vitality may be lessened by 
frost or other injury, its vigor of germination lowered 
by" disease and exposure, while the health and purity of 
the resulting crop may be seriously affected by the pres- 
ence of disease spores and weed seeds in the sample sown. 

It is man's privilege to see that the seed he uses will 
germinate and germinate vigorously, that it is free from 
disease and admixture, and that it is a sort that is suited 
to the climate and soil where it is to be planted. These 
are fundamental requirements. They constitute tShe 
primary elements of successful crop growing. They are 
the only things essential in good seed, and fortunately 
for us it is absolutely within our power to see that the 
seed= we sow meets all these requirements. 

317. Some Fundamental Facts. — The seed, plant food 
materials, moisture, heat, light and air are all absolutely 



360 



DRY FARMING 



essential to growth. When each is provided in suitable 
quantity and in available form, the soil produces abund- 
antly. If any one is lacking, no growth whatever will 
take place. And it is important to note that the factor 
that is present in smallest quantity in relation to the 




Fig. 107. — Bacon Hogs in the Making. 

need of the crop will determine the yield. A chain is as 
strong as its weakest link. The yield of a crop will be 
as high and no higher than the supply of the limiting 
factor will permit. 

318. The Vital Part of the Problem— That of Profit.— 
It is not enough that man should know the factors that 
are essential to plant growth nor that he should provide 
them. The intelligent farmer does not farm for his 
health alone. For him there must be some profit after 
the various items in the cost of production have been 
paid. 

It is not difficult to grow crops. It is not very difficult 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 361 

to produce large yields. But it is a difficult matter to 
grow crops at a profit whether the yields be small or large. 

319. Factors Affecting Profit. — Suitable crops planted 
in productive soil according to up-to-date methods do not 
necessarily yield profitable returns. In order that a pro- 
fit may be ^.ssured, not only must all the essential condi- 
tions of growth be provided, but (1) the crop must be 
protected from weeds, insects, plant diseases and storms, 
and (2) either the cost of production or the selling price 
must be controlled. 

320. The Cost of Weeds.— Weeds rob the crop of its 
plant food and moisture and increase the cost of produc- 
tion. It has been estimated by the Department of Agri- 
culture that the weed crop of Saskatchewan costs her 
farmers $25,000,000 a year, and probably this item does 
not cost the average farmer in Saskatchewan more than 
it does the average one in either of the other Prairie 
Provinces. 

321. The Cost of Insects. — Insect, animal or bird pests 
may lessen the yield or quality of the crop either before 
or after maturity. The Dominion Department of Agri- 
culture places the loss through destruction of crops by 
cutworms in one district in a single season at 35,000 
acres. And the cutworm is only one of dozens of insects 
that take an annual toll from the farmer's crops. 

322. The Loss from Rust. — Plant diseases nourish them- 
selves on the tissues of plants and thus lessen the yield 
or quality or both. The loss to Western Canada from 
rust alone in the year 1916 has been estimated to average 
six bushels per acre. This at the October price of $1.50 
per bushel on an area of aproximately 12,000,000 acres, 
reaches the enormous sum of over $100,000,000. In 
other years wheat smut, flax wilt, potato blight and other 



362 DRY FARMING 

fungous or bacterial enemies have contributed to the 
large annual loss from plant diseases. 

323. The Amount Hail Takes from the Profits.— Severe 
storms may injure the soil and damage the crop by soil 
"drifting" or by stunting, lodging or breaking down the 
plants, or by shattering the grain. The loss from hail 
is variously estimated at from one-half to two and one- 
half per cent, of the total acreage, or on the basis of the 
present acreage a loss of 125,000 to 600,000 acres. The 
damage done 'by hail in the year 1916 was considerably 
greater than the highest of these percentages. These 
storms comie as the insurance men say ''by act of Provi- 
dence". It is fortunate that provision for carrying this 
risk has been provided by hail insurance companies. 

324. The Moral. — And yet these losses may occur even 
after the soil has been mad-e productive. It is apparent 
that one of three things must result: — (1) those factors 
that affect cost must be controlled, or (2) the price must 
be regulated by the producer, or (3) the business of grow- 
ing crops profitably cannot be controlled, and is therefore 
more or less of a gamble. 

325. The Cost of Production and the Selling Price. — 
A farmer, like any other business man, k legitimately 
concerned with obtaining the largest possible return for 
his labor and for the capital invested'. This being the 
case he is concerned with the profits of his business rather 
than with his total output. Society in general is greatly 
concerned with the desirability of increasing the quan- 
tity of foodstuffs produced, since cost of living is thereby 
reduced. Herein lies the reason for the cry "Back to 
the Land" and the slogan "Greater Production" raised by 
those not living on the land. 

The farmer from a purely business point of view is 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 363 

concerned with the problem of greater production only 
in so far as it tends to increase his own net profits. He 
has been forced to recognize that larger crops do not 
necessarily mean larger net returns, partly because the 
larger crop usually costs more to produce, and partly 
because a bountiful crop tends to reduce the selling price. 
Profit is measured by the difference between the cost of 
production and the selling price and farmers are con- 
cerned with maintaining, if possible, a reasonable and 
constant spread between the two. 

Intelligent and timely cultural practices, hard work, 
good management and frugal habits will lower the unit 
cost of production and increase the unit value. But the 
cost of the farmer's machinery and other equipment, the 
cost of his money and, to a considerable extent, the cost 
of his living are all fixed by conditions and institutions 
over which he individually has no control. It is coming 
to be realized, however, that those factors which cannot 
be controlled by individual effort may be very consider- 
ably modified by collective and co-operative effort. Far- 
mers' organizations seem to be in a fair way toward hav- 
ing tariff schedules, particularly those on implements of 
production, reduced, thereby reducing cost of produc- 
tion. Farmers' business organizations in the handling 
of agricultural implements and supplies in general have 
had considerable to do with keeping down the costs of 
these supplies. The cost of money to the farmer has also 
been redticed by organizations, such as rural credits 
societies and farm loan associations dtesigned to meet 
the needs of the agriculturist. In general the cost of 
production seems to have been materially reduced where- 
ever farmers' organizations have made a determined 
effort to compete in the handling of farmers^ business. 



364 



DRY FARMING 



The price a fanner g«ts for his products is fixed by the 
law of supply and demand, the tariff schedules, the cost 
of transportation and the cost of handling by middlemen. 
Here even more than in the cost of production the factors 
that determine the selling price are beyond the influence 




Pig. 108. — Manitoba Farm Yard Scene, in Winter. 



of the individual prod^ucer. Individually a farmer can 
influence the price of wheat about as much as he can the 
"state of the weather. If he is ever to get a larger propor- 
tion of the consumer's price it seems apparent that it 
must be through co-operative effort. 

The price of crops in the future as in the past will in 
a large measure be controlled by the law of supply and 
demand. The Wendy's demand is relatively constant. 
May not the supply be made more uniform ? By a better 
knowledge of the probable market requirements may it 
not be pcssible to avoid over-production of one crop and 
under-production of another with consequent loss in net 
returns ? May it not also be possible to arrive at a valu- 
ation of the services of transportation companies and 
middlemen, with fairness to all concerned? These are 
problem;* that farmers, transportation companies, middle- 
men 'and consumers must solve collectively. In this way 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 365 

only will the interests of society as a whole, rather than 
that of any class or section of it, be equitably served. 

326. The State's Third of the Problem-That of a Per- 
manent Agriculture.— The conditions that affect growth 
and the factors that affect profit are and will continue to 
be the chief considerations of the individual farmer. Yet 
a third set of conditions of vastly greater importance to 
the future of the state, viz., those that affect the perman- 
ence of our agriculture, remain to be considered. 

We are hearing much to-day on the one hand about 
the "depletion" of the land, the loss of "fertility" and 
the "exhaustion" of plant food from the soil ; and from 
another quarter about our soil being "the richest in the 
world", and about its supply of plant food being "inex- 
haustible"". 

We hear of some land that after continuous cropping 
and no return of plant food, is producing as much as, or 
more than it did a generation ago, and we are led to ask 
ourselves, "Do soils wear out?" "Can they become de- 
pleted ?" "Are they being exhausted ?" These are ques- 
tions upon our solution of which the future material 
success of Western Canada very largely depends. 

What is fertility? In its narrowest sense it is plant 
foodi materials in the soil, — the chemical substances 
plants use in growing. In its broadest sense *it is ability 
to produce crops, and includes (1) "available" plant 
food, (2) tilth, or a favorable condition of the soil with 
relation to water and heat and air; (3) health, or free- 
dom of the soil from disease, and (4) purity, or its rela- 
tive freedom from weeds and weed seeds. In its broadest 
sense "fertility" means prodtictiveness, which is not 
necessarily synonymous with, although generally closely 



366 DRY FARMING 

related! to, the content of plant food materials in the soil. 

Soils do not become literally "depleted"^ or "exhausted" 
of the plant food elements they contain, although the 
amount may he seriously lessened, but the land may be- 
come depleted or exhausted of its "productiveness". 
These so-called "depleted' soils may at any time be made 
productive, but the trouble is they cannot be made to 
produce a profit until such time as the pressure of popu- 
lation or some other economic condition increases the 
price of soil products or lowers the cost of production. 
And if this does not happen, such soils remain unprofit- 
able and unproductive. In any case they seldom redeem 
themselves. They generally have to be built up by capital 
brought from some other source. Such soils become not 
only a source of loss to the man who operates them but 
also a burden to the state which indirectly has to bear, 
not only the loss from their inefficient use, but also the 
cost of their redemption. 

327. Factors that Affect Permanence. — The chief factors 
that affect the maintenance of productiveness in any com- 
munity have already been mentioned, but will bear re- 
peating. They are: 

1. The maintenance of soil tilth, which in practice 
generally means the maintenance of oi^anic matter. 

2. The maintenance of soil health, or the prevention 
or control of plant diseases that live in the soil. 

3. The maintenance of soil purity, or weed control, and 
last but by far the most important in the long run 

4. The maintenance of a sufficient amount of available 
plant food. 

In addition to being productive, a permanent agricul- 
ture must also he a profitable agriculture. 
And now, having considered this many-sided problem 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 367 

the fanner has to solve, let us examine the nature and 
effectiveness of the instruments he has 'been g^iven with 
which to achieve his purpose. 

328. The Means at Man's Disposal for Controlling or In- 
fluencing the Factors of Growth, Profit and Permanence. — 

The instruments now available for controlling or in- 
fluencing the factors of growth, profit and permanence 
are : 

1. The choice of suitable crops. 

2. Suitable crop management practices. 

3. The improvement of crops by selection and breeding. 

4. Irrigation or drainage, or both. 

5. Tillage. 

6. Suitable crop rotations. 

7. The use of live stock. 

8. The application of business principles to the man- 
agement of the whole farm — the land, the stock, the 
labor, the finances and the miachinery and other 

- equipment. 

9. The use of legumes and nitrogen fixing bacteria. 

10. The utilization of manures. 

329. The Choice of Suitable Crops. — Nature has given 
us some plants that resist disease, some that resist frost, 
some that resist drought, and some that avoid these con- 
ditions. A great number of crops suited to different 
systems of farming are available to choose from, and the 
experience of farmers and the records of our experiment 
stations are fast teaching us the ones that are best suited 
to our climate and soil. The value of some new and. un- 
tried crops has yet to be determined, and the suitability 
of different classes and typ^ of crops for peculiar local 
soil and climatic conditions is a line of work that needs 
greater attention. But our present knowledge, if utilized. 



368 



DRY FARMING 



is sufficient for our present need, and we have faith that 
new plant forms will he developed or discovered that will 
meet any pressing requirements of the future. 

Some doubt exists concerning the relative value of dif- 
ferent varieties for some local climatic and soil condi- 
tions, but these are being quickly dispelled. One needs but

refer to the nearest experiment station for the results of 
comparative tests. If these are not conclusive, co-opera- 
tive trials on one's own farm can easily be made. It is 
sufficient here to refer the reader to the reports of the 
different experiment stations, and to urge him to keep 
informed on the results of official tests. 

330. Suitable Crop Management Practices. — The clean- 
ing of the seed, its treatment for disease, the time, rate 
and depth of planting, and the time and method of bar- 



PROBLEM OP CROP PRODUCTION 369 

vesting and curing of crops, offer many opportunities 
for error. In new countries, and' particularly where the 
settlers are unfamiliar with farming, the best practices 
have to be learned by experience, and in the early days of 
such settlements this experience is often gained at a very 
great cost. But even now there is a considerable fund of 
information, sufficient at least to make a safe working 
guide to the successful prosecution of each of these, even 
under the diverse climatic conditions the different parts 
of the West present. The experimental farms have been 
given the responsibility for getting more accurate infor- 
mation on this subject and their results are being made 
available to all in their annual reports and periodical 
bulletins. No one need long remain in the dark concern- 
ing the '"'crop management" practices now recognized as 
suitable in different portions of Western Canada. 

331. The Improvement of Crops. — Men are improving 
crops by doing two things: (1) by the negative process 
of preventing them from deteriorating, and (2) by in- 
creasing their hereditary power with respect to yield, 
quality, or some other economic character. The first is 
the business of the farmer, the responsibility for the 
second lies with our experiment stations. 

Our crops have in many instances deteriorated sadly 
by admixture with weeds and seeds of other crops, by 
attacks of disease, by drought and frost and by improper 
care of the seed. The prevention of each of these in so 
far as it is possible is necessary in order to maintain pro- 
ductiveness and quality. It is not always within the far- 
mer's power to wholly prevent these conditions, but 
ordinarily he can do much to lessen their ill effects. 

The hereditary power of our crops has been and is 
being improved by selection and by artificial crossing. 



370 DRY FARMING 

followed by selection. It is true generally that "like pro 
duces like", fcut it is not always so. Variations occur in 
all our crops. It is necessary then that the undesirable 
variants be eliminated and that the favorable ones be 
isolated and tested out, and if better than the parent, 
increased and made available to the crop grower. This 
is accomplished by the selection of individual plants, the 
propagation of the seed in a "pure culture", the testing 
of its yield and constancy for a number of years, and 
then increasing it as quickly as possible and making it 
available to the crop grower. 

"Crossing" is resorted to, first, in order to produce 
variation so as to give greater opportunity for selection, 
and second, to engraft on a race some desirable charac- 
ter possessed by another. Crossing or breeding, the in- 
termixture of the blood of two parents results in many 
new combinations of characters, some one of which may 
be the very one desired by the breeder. This favorable 
plant must be found, isolated, tested out, the seed in- 
creased, and then distributed. Practically all of the 
common crops now grown have felt the influence of the 
breeders' touch. Marquis wheat. Victory oats, O.A.C. 
No. 21 barley and N.D. No. 959 winter rye are familiar 
examples of improvement by selection and breeding. 

332. Irrigation and Drainage. — In warm, dry climates, 
moisture is the limiting factor in crop production. Where 
water can be secured by artificial means, a profitable 
agriculture generally results. We practise irrigation in 
parts of Western of Canada, but over most of our coun- 
try, it is not possible to do so, because water is not avail- 
able. 

In wet climates and low lying soils moisture may also 
limit the yield, not because there is too little, but because 



PKOBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 371 

there is too much in the soil. Under such conditions the 
removal of the surplus by artificial surface or under- 
ground drainage is just as necessary as the addition of 
of water to dry lands. Outside a few local areas and on 
low, flat lands and alkaline soils, land drainage is not a 
serious problem in the Prairie Provinces, 

333. Tillage. — ^^Tillage is the greatest means at man's 
disposal for controlling the conditions that at the present 
time are causing low yields on the farms of Western Can- 
ada. It is also by far the largest single item on the cost 
side of the crop account. Tillage is a universal practice, 
but on account of the great variation in soil, temperature 
and moisture conditions in different countries and in dif- 
ferent parts of the same country, the various methods 
employed art still fruitful of debate and somewhat dif- 
ficult to determine satisfactorily. At the present time in 
the West, tillage is one of the most important subjects 
connected with crop growing, yet it is one upon which 
conclusive data concerning the relative value of different 
pi actices is not available for more than a few sections of 
the country. In the dry year of 1914 the yields of Mar- 
quis wheat at Saskatoon ranged from six bushels per 
acre to thirty-two. In the wet year of 1915 they ranged 
from seventeen to forty-seven. The range in yield in each 
of these seasons was due entirely to the different tillage 
practices followed. This subject is discussed at some 
length in chapters VII to X. 

334. Crop Rotations.— The most reliable information 
the world affords on the value of crop rotations shows 
that land in England when cropped continuously to 
wheat for sixty years produced an average of fourteen 
bushels per acre, and when grown in a rotation of turnips 
barley, clover and wheat it produced twenty-five bushels 



372 DRY FARMING 

per acre every fourth year for the same len^h of time. 
The most reliaTjle information that America affords shows 
that corn in Illinois when grown continuously for 
twenty-nine years produced twenty-seven bushels per 
acre, while in a rotation of corn and oats it produced 
forty-six bushels, and in a rotation of com, oats and 
clover, fifty-eight bushels per acre. 

But we are not living either in England or in Illinois. 
Their rotations d'o not suit the conditions found here. 
Yet our rotations of the future must include, as do those 
of older regions, a legume crop, an intertilled or fallow 
crop and a money crop. Until recently in Western Can- 
ada, neither legumes nor intertilled crops suitable for use 
in a large way were available, or if so were either not 
well suited to all conditions or did not lend themselves 
satisfactorily to practicable changes in our present sys- 
tem of farming. Some difficulties have yet to be sur- 
mounted before paying crop rotations are discovered and 
firmly established, but at least we are fast becoming 
familiar with the crops we must depend upon not only as 
nitrogen gatherers and as intertilled crops but also as 
money crops. 

In the meantime the spread of weeds, the "drifting" 
of soil and the loss of organic matter 'are in many places 
lowering the profit from grain farming so materially that 
resort to hay crops occasiona:lly is being practised. In 
other places corn is coming to be a partial substitute fori 
the fallow. It is possible that these crops, together with] 
alfalfa, or some other legume such as sweet clover, mayj 
be the stejiping stones to more desirable crop rotations, j 

335. Crop Rotations and Live Stock. — The introdiictionl 
of a large acreage of forage crops on the farms of West-j 
ern Canada will require an enormous initial outlay oil 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 373 

capital for stock and for fencing and buildings. The 
greater part of this money must be made on our farms. 
The problem then will be solved but slowly. It is largely a 
rotation, a farm management and an economic problem. 
The purely agronomic or crop and soil phases of it are 
the least difficult to answer. 

In our opinion we shall not control weeds and drifting 
soil permanently until we adapt our systems of farming 
to meet those conditions which have caused and are now 
causing low yields and poor quality in our crops. That 
adaptation will include a rotation of crops designed 
chiefly for controlling weeds and drifting soil, for lessen- 
ing the cost of production and for building up a more 
permanent agriculture. It will necessarily include live 
stock, (1) to make use of the forage crops that must be 
grown, (2) to lessen the amount, and thereby the cost of 
the tillage nec^sary to control weeds, (3) to lessen the 
risk of our one-crop system and (4) to turn the wastage 
and by-products of the farm into a realizable asset. 

336. Business Farming. — It is not long since the farmer 
did not need to be a business man. He produced his own 
food, he grew and manufactured his own clothing and 
built his own house. He lived unto himself largely. He 
needed little business training. 

The modern farmer cannot live unto himself. He does 
not produce his own clothing nor the material to build 
his house, nor does he grind his own wheat into flour. 
To-day he must spend, even for the necessities of life. 
Therefore he must have something to sell. In other 
words, the modern farmer must be a business man. 

It does not take long to learn the art of farming, but 
unfortunately it takes some of us a long time to learn the 
art of successful farm business. It would seem that we 



374 DRY FARMING 

as individiials might with profit give more attention to 
mathematics in relation to our business. Our profits are 
determined 'by the difference between our receipts and 
our expenditures, and not by our gross incomes. Let us 
know, if possible, the essentials of our own business enter- 
prises. It would seem also that we as a class must prac- 
tise greater co-operation. Our co-operative enterprises 
have accomplished much in the interest of the farmer, 
chiefly in the marketing end of his business, and they 
have still much opportunity for service. At the same 
time let us not forget that as individuals we can still do 
much to lower the cost of production and to lessen the 
risk in farming, both of which are directly related to

337. Legumes and Inoculation. — The air over every 
acre of land contains seventy million pounds of nitrogen, 
the most costly of fertilizing elements. This amount is 
sufficient to supply the nitrogen of fifty bushel crops of 
wheat every year for a million years, yet farmers in some 
countries are paying twenty cents a pound for nitrogen 
to put on the land. Nitrogen in the air can be secured 
at no cost to the farmer if he will but grow some legume 
crop at intervals. This kind of crop when inoculated 
with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, has the power of drawing 
upon the immense store of nitrogen in the air. 

In such of our virgin soils as are rich in nitrogen it is 
possible that the use of legume crops may not now result 
in large increases in yield. Investigations at present 
under way will soon answer that question. In the mean- 
time the fundamental fact regarding legumes should not 
be forgotten. Neither should it be forgotten that all our 
soils are not virgin, nor are all rich in nitrogen. 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 375 

338. The Use of Mamires, — Land cropped continuously 
to wheat for fifty-five years in England produced an 
average yield of 12.9 bushels per acre, while in a nearby 
field the wheat in a rotation that was heavily fertilized 
gave an average of 35.5 bushels. 

In Illinois, as was stated previously, land continuously 
cropped to corn for twenty-nine years produced an aver- 
age of 27 bushels per acre, in a rotation of corn and oats, 
46 bushels and in a rotation of corn, oats and clover, 58 
bushels per acre. In the la:tter rotation when the land 
was manured the yield was 81 bushels, and when man- 
ured and given commercial fertilizers as well, the yield 
was 96 bushels of shelled corn per acre. 

At the present time we cannot get such large increases 
from the use of either manures or commercial fertilizers, 
although, we can and do get good returns from the intel- 
ligent use of manure, even on our new soils. 

In this connection a definite statement regarding the 
amount of the more important food elements in western 
soils and the actual results of the application of manures 
and fertilizers to them may not be out of place. 

In the surface 6 2/3 inches of the normal Saskatchewan 
soils so far analyzed by the Department of Chemistry of 
the Provincial University, the nitrogen supply ranges 
from 3,000 to 14,000 pounds, the phosphorous from 1,000 
to 3,000 pounds, and the potassium supply from 14,000 
to 45,000 pound's. Assuming that the straw were all 
returned to the land, the amount of these elements re- 
moved from the soil in the production of one bushel of 
wheat would be 1 2-5 pounds of nitrogen, 1-5 pound of 
phosphorus and about 1-5 of a pound of potassium. 

It is, therefore, apparent that if all of this plant food 
could be utilized by crops without loss, there is enough 



376 DRY FARMING 

nitrogen to produce from 2,000 to 10,000 bushels of wheat, 
enough phosphorus to produce 5,000 to 15,000 bushels and 
enough potassium to produce from 70,000 to 225,000 
bushels in the surface 6 2-3 inches of one acre. 

Man would take out all this wheat in a year if he could, 
and leave none for future generations, but Providence 
has wisely provided that only about 2 per cent, of the 
content of certain elements, 1 per cent, of others and 1-4 
of 1 per cent, of still others can be annually released from 
the soil acd taken up by growing plants, so that we can- 
not literally deplete our soils of their potential wealth 
by cropping even if we would; but we can and are de- 
pleting even the best of our soils of their surplus wealth 
and their productiveness. We must not let the sup- 
ply of total plant food get so low that the small per- 
centage that becomes available to plants annually will 
be insufficient for a large crop. 

It may be asked, why add manure or other fertilizer to 
soil containing so much plant food ? The answer is to be 
found in the proportion of the plant food in the soil that 
is available to plants. The elements added in decayed 
manure are quickly available to the plant, while much of 
that found in the soil is not. And in addition, decaying 
organic manures not only improve the physical condition 
of the soil, lessen its tendency to blow, and improve its 
moisture holding power, but also liberate or m'ake avail- 
able other moj^e ok less insoluble plant food elements. 
Of course it costs money to handle manure and there are 
some miuor objections to its use under certain conditions. 
Nevertheless at many different places in the West it has 
increased the yield of every crop tested, even on rich 
land. 

If a system of permanent agriculture is to be estab- 



PROBLEM OF CROP PRODUCTION 377 

lished on our western prairies — and our future welfare 
depends upon its establishment — we must not carry our 
wheat system too far. We cannot waste the fertility of 
our soil and still have it. To-day we are selling our soil 
fertility at the rate of 25 cents for each bushel of wheat 
sold. We individually can afford to do that for some 
time, but the State cannot afford to permit us to do it 
indefinitely. 

339. In Conclusion, — It is the moral duty of the crop 
grower to produce as large crops as can be profitably 
grown. It is the double function of society to see (1) that' 
tbe farmer is not hampered in this purpose by economic 
disadvantages and (2) that agriculture receives such co- 
operation and encouragement from the State as will 
enable it to establish a more permanent system of farm- 

ipg. 

\ Intelligent tillage, the choice of suitable crops, and 
suitable cultural practices, will enable us to develop the 
resources of our soil. Business methods and in some 
places a rotation of crops and the introduction of live 
stock will enable us to produce crops more profitably, 
but only the use of legume crops, the practice of a crop 
rotation and the return to the soil of some of the plant 
food we remove in crops and in fallowing will enable us 
to build up a permanent agriculture, \and a permanent 
agriculture is absolutely essential to'' the future well- 
being of the State. 

In the final analysis our ultimate success as a nation 
depends not only upon our ability to produce profitable 
crops now, but upon our ability to keep on producing 
profitable crops.
