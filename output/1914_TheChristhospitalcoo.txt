HOW TO MEASURE 

Correct measurements are absolutely neces- 
sary to insure the best results. Measuring cups 
which are divided into quarters and thirds, hold- 
ing Yz pint, are indispensable, also tea and table- 
spoons and a case knife. 

Flour, meal, powdered and confectioner's 
sugar should be sifted before measuring. 

A cupful is measured level. 

To measure a cupful, put in the ingredients 
by spoonfuls, rounded slightly and level with a 
case knife. 

To measure a tea or tablespoonful, dip the 
spoon in the ingredient, fill, lift, then with the 
straight ^^'gt of the knife resting on both edges 
of the spoon, push off all the extra material, leav- 
ing the material exactly level with the edges of 
the spoon. To measure ^, divide with a knife 
lengthwise of spoon. Divide halves crosswise 
for quarters. 

Measuring Liquids: 

A cup of liquid is all the cup will hold. A tea 
or tablespoon is all the spoon will hold. 

Measuring Butter, Lard, etc. : 

To measure butter, lard, or other solid fats, 
pack solidly into the cup or spoon and level with 
a knife. 

When dry ingredients, fats, and liquids are 
called for in the same recipe, measure in the order 
given, thus prevent using more than one cup. 



Soups. 



SOUPS. 

Soup making is not as difficult a task as it first 
appears. A stock pot is indispensable. When the 
meat comes from the market, all bones which are 
removed before meat is cooked should be put into 
the pot together with any left over pieces of meat, 
cold water added, and be allowed to cook for 6 
or 7 hours. Vegetables, spices, and salt should 
be added the last hour of cooking. In small 
families where the quantity of meat is less, it will 
be necessary to buy meat especially for soup. 
When this is done the meat is cut from the fore 
or hind shin — because of the marrow-bones they 
contain. 

To clarify soup stock: 

I qt. stock. I egg, white and shell. 

y^ cup cold water. 

Remove all fat. Beat egg white slightly. Add 
this and crushed shell to the jelly. Heat slowly to 
the boiling point, stirring constantly. Boil 3 min., 
simmer 10 min., or until the soup clears, without 
stirring. Let settle, adding cold water. Strain 
through damp cheese cloth. 

Season, reheat, serve at once.

4 49 



alive. Plunge them into boiling water. Cook 
below boiling point 15-20 min. When cooked, 
plunge into cold water. Remove the claAvs and 
all of the legs, using the tw^isting motion. Re- 
move the apron. Insert the thumb and break 
the body from the shell. There will be left in 
the shell the stomach, a white, spongy mass, 
and some of the liver, slightly green and usually 
very soft. This may be saved and put with the 
crab meat. Any red substance is coral ; this is 
saved and put with meat. Open the body by 
breaking and remove the white meat with the 
fingers. Remove meat from claws and legs if 
they are large enough to make it worth while 
Scrub the upper shell with a brush and sapolio 
and dry them out before using them for filling. 
Make a sauce of butter, flour, salt, mustard, and 
cream. Then add the other ingredients. Put 
this mixture into shells, cover with buttered 
crumbs — 2 tablespoons butter to i cup crumbs. 
Put into a hot oven long enough to brown the 
crumbs. 

LOBSTER. 
Preparation is almost the same. They must 
be cooked ^ hour if meat is not to be cooked 
again. Purchase alive. Remove claws and 
legs same way as crabs. Remove body from 
shell by pushing tail forward. Remove the gills 
and stomach, which ma}^ remain in the shells — 
this is called the lady. Save the liver and coral. 
The intestine is one straight tube which runs 
from the stomach through the body. Remove 

51 



this. Remove the meat from the shell. Tail is 
solid meat. If you do not wish the shell for 
salad, crush it to remove meat.

The tray cloth should just fit over the edge 
of the tray. 

Whenever possible place a bright flower on 
the tray. 

After laying the cloth, locate the plate. Place 
the knife at the right of the plate — cutting edge 
tov^ard the plate. Place the spoon at the right 
of the knife, bowl up. Place the fork at the left 
of the plate, tines up. The individual butter is 
placed at the tip of the fork a little to the left.

spoon, with the handle of the cup to the right. 
The water glass is placed at the tip of the knife, 
a little to the right. Arrange the other dishes 
to suit the convenience of the patient. 

Provide plate covers, if possible. 

Keep all noise of the preparation of food and 
odors from the cooking of food from the sick 
room. 

Let the person who serves the food be neat 
in appearance, and have it preferably a person 
with a quiet, cheerful manner. 

Whenever possible, bathe the hands and face 
of the patient before serving food to him. 

Be punctual in serving meals. 

Have everything for service immaculate. Use 
the most attractive dishes and linen that can be 
obtained. 

Arrange things in an attractive and conveni- 
ent form. 

Serve only small amounts at one time. 

Fill cups and glasses only | full. 

249 



Use other cups and glasses than those in 
which medicines have been administered. 

Serve individual cup, glass, or dish on a plate 
or small tray covered with a doily. 

Serve hot food hot and in hot dishes. 

Serve cold drinks and fruit cool rather than 
ice cold. 

Taste all food before serving to determine 
temperature and seasoning. 

For this use a spoon separate from that given 
to the patient. 

Taste the food in a room apart from the sick 
room. 

Remove unfinished food and soiled dishes 
from the room as soon as possible.

I lb. sugar to every lb. of plums. Place them 
with the sugar in alternate layers in a sauce 
pan. Allow them to stand until some of the 
juice has been extracted, or add a very small 
quantity to just moisten the bottom of the pan. 
Heat gradually to the boiling point and boil 
gently with frequent stirring until the fruit loses 
its shape and the juice is of the consistency of 
molasses. Pour the mixture into hot jelly glasses

taken out easily.

to drip from fruit. Measure juice and allow equal 
volume of sugar. Place this in a moderate oven 
to heat. 

Return juice to the fire and cook until when 
dropped from a spoon it forms a thickened drop. 
Add the sugar, stirring until dissolved, and con- 
tinue boiling until a heavy drop forms on the 
spoon and falls on solid piece. Pour jelly into
