Introduction 

his is the "pure food*' age. So much has been written, 
so many laws have been made, so much discussion has 
been rife in favor of this all-important topic for the 
housewife, that we feel no apology or explanation is neces- 
sary for this book of ** Home Helps. " 

We have tried to make it just what its name implies — a 
help for the home. Every housewife should have a cook- 
book, whether she be a bride with little or no experience or a 
past-master in the culinary line. The trouble has been to find 
a book that was practical, containing mostly simple, every- 
day, useftd recipes, calling for few ingredients and requiring 
little time in preparation. We believe we have succeeded in 
making "Home Helps" the most practical book in this 
respect ever issued. 

The old saying, " Too many cooks spoil the broth " is not 
applicable here, and in selecting the favorite recipes of Mrs. 
Lincoln, Mrs. Rorer, Mrs. Armstrong, Marion Harland and 
Miss Willis, we have incorporated a feature never before 
fotind in one voltime. 

We commend this book to the daily use of the millions 
of American housewives who are interested in preparing pure 
foods under the most approved and scientific methods. 
Whether your household ** cookery*' is in your own hands or 
that of a hired cook, this volume cannot fail to be invaluable. 
The more you use it, the more good you will get from it. 

While this book is published in the interests of Cottolene, 
the perfect shortening which has been aptly termed ** Nature's 
GiiEt from The Sunny South," and Cottolene is naturally 
specified as the cooking fat in a number of recipes where 
lard or butter would otherwise be used, there are many 
recipes given where no mention of Cottolen^ is made; and, 
furthermore, wherever this superior cotton -oil cooking fat is 
specified, it has only been after careful tests by these famou.«J 
experts have shown it to be preferable to either lard or 
butter from the standpoint of economy, palatability and 
healthftdness. 

Yours for healthful cooking,

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



Cottolene 



Hottolene, the perfect shortening, is a cooking fat of about the 
consistency of butter. It is neutral in taste, practically 
without odor, and is composed of but two ingredients — care- 
fully selected cotton oil, refined by our own exclusive process, and 
the choicest beef suet. It contains nothing else, not even salt. 

Cottolene is better than lard — better than butter. Lard is made' 
from hog fat, which is often impure and always indigestible. Cotto- 
lene on the contrary is essentially a vegetable product, contains not an 
otmce of hog fat, and is dean and pure, from inception to completion. 
In cakes and £ine pastry, Cottolene can be substituted for butter with 
excellent results, and for fr3ring it is better. Cottolene is also more 
economical than either lard or butter — K ^^s being required. 

As further evidence of its superiority over all other cooking fats, 
Cottolene was awarded the Grand Prize (highest award possible) at 
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, held in St. Louis in 1904, as were 
also cakes and pastry baked with Cottolene. Gold Medals, represent- 
ing highest awards in each case, were also granted Cottolene at the 
Charleston Exposition in 1902, Paris Exposition in 1900, and at the 
Chicago World's Fair in 1893. 

Cottolene is packed only in sealed tins of special design, which are 
absolutely air-tight and protect the contents not only from all odors 

* 

of coal-oil, codfish, etc., so common in the average grocery, but also 
from dust, dirt and other contaminations to which goods sold in bulk 
' — such as lard — are frequently exposed. 

There are many imitations, but remember — no imitation was ever 
so good as the original. There is only one Cottolene. Take No Sub- 
stitute.

HOW TO USE COTTOLENE 



/ 



How^ to Use Cottolene 



|f you occasionally buy strong butter or rancid lard you do not 
denounce butter or lard, or give up their use. Be as fair with 



m 

Cottolene. No edible fat will keep indefinitely when stored 
too long in a warm place, or otherwise abused. 

A general rule for the use of Cottolene as shortening in all mixtures 
is: Use one-third less than the amount given for butter or lard in the 
recipe. 

For cake making, cream the Cottolene as you wotdd butter, add- 
ing a little salt, as it contains none. 

In saut^ing, or browning, use only enough Cottolene to grease the 
pan. Add more fat when you turn the food. Cottolene should be put 
into the pan while cold and after the bottom of the pan is once covered 
with the m^ted Cottolene, more can be added as desired. XTnless 
used in this way, Cottolene may bum and throw oft an odor, as 
would any other cooking fat. 

For deep fr3ring, have Cottolene at least deep enough to cover, 
or float, the article being fried, heating slowly. For uncooked mix- 
tures, test with a bit of dough, which should rise at once to the top 
with some sputtering; the fat shotild be kept at an even temperature. 
For croquettes, fish balls, or other cooked mixtures which will brown 
in one minute, test with a block of white bread, whicl; should brown 
in a few seconds. Make this test always — never trust your eye. 

Uncooked fish and meat are better when covered with bread 
crumbs to give the crisp crust desired in fried food. The fat should 
be hot at first, that it may not penetrate, then reduce the heat, that 
the food may cook till done, without burning. Never let the fat heat 
to the smoking point, for then it is burning hot. Cook only three or 
four pieces at once, for more will chill the fat and prevent perfect 
frying. Clarify the fat after frying, by browning a piece of raw potato 
in it, then strain through fine cheese cloth. It is then again ready to 
use.

What Noted Cooking Bx' 
perts Think of Cottolene 

n additiDn to the remarks and recommendations made in other 
parts of this book, the following testimonials received from 
famous authorities on ^Domestic Science, attest the high regard 
in which Cottolene is held by all those who have made a careful study 
of food preparation and food values. 

MRS. SARAH TYSON RORER 

Principal Philadelphia Cooking School and Culinary Editor " The 
Ladies' Home Journal, " \ 

" I use Cottolene in every and all the ways that one would use lard, also in the 
preparation of sweet cakes. I consider it an important frying medium and a much 
more healthful product than lard." 

MARION HARLAND 

Author of the famous *' Marion Harland Cook Book.'' 

" Many years ago I discontinued the use of lard in my kitchen and substituted 
for it — af an experiment— Cottolene, then comparatively a new product. Since my 
first trial of it I can truly say that it has given complete satisfaction, whether it is 
used alone, as ' shortening,' or in combination with bfitter in i>astry, biscuits, etc., or 
in frying. I honestly believe it to be the very best thing of its kind ever offered to 
the American housekeeper." 

MRS. JANET M. HILL 

Editor " Boston Cooking School Magazine" 

" For several years I have used Cottolene in my own kitchen and find it very 
latisfactory. I am glad to commend it." 



MRS. SARAH PEARSON STUART 

Editor Household Department " American Housekeeper." 

" When properly used, Cottolene never makes other than Ught. wholesome and 
nutritious food, that can be readily digested by the most delicate stomach." 



MRS. HELEN ARMSTRONG 

Teacher of Cookery. 

" Having used Cottolene constantly for over five years, both as shortening and 
for frying purposes', I feel no hesitancy in recommending it as a very suf>erior article. 
It is not only much more wholesome than lard, but produces more palatable results." 



These are but a few. Other well known authorities who have tested 
Cottolene and recommend its use are : 

Mrs. F. A. Benson Mrs. Emma P. Ewingr 

and Mrs. Christine Terhune Herrick 




NOTED EXPERTS PRAISE COTTOLENE 7 

Eminent Physiciatns 

Endorse Cottolene 

ine-tenths of all human ailments are due primarily to indiges- 
tion or are aggravated because of it. The chief cause of in- 
digestion is food prepared with lard. The following are but 
brief extracts from letters received, showing the high esteem in which 
Cottolene is regarded as a cooking medium by physicians ranking 
among the highest in the profession. 

J. HOBART EGBERT, A. M., M. D., PH. D. 

Froi^an article in the "Medical Sumtnary** entitled "Available 

Facts for Consumptives and Others with Wasting Diseases ". 

** In cooking food, we would recommend the preparation known as ' Cottolene \ 
a wholesome combination of fresh beef suet and purest cottonseed oil. This prepara- 
tion is 1»oth economical and convenient, free from adulterations and impurities, and 
dietetic experiments conclusively show that incorporated in food it yields to the body 
available nourishment." 

R. OGDEN DOREMUS, M. D., LL. D. 

Professor of Chemistry, Toxicology and Medical Jurisprudence, 
Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York. 

" As a substitate for lard, which is its purpose, Cottolene possesses all the desirable 
qualities of lard without having the objectionable features inherent in aU products 
obtained from swine." 

DR. JAMES PAIGE EMERY, 

From an article in the "American Housekeeper" entitled "The 

Most Healthful of All Cooking Fats". 

" Cottolene, being essentially a vegetable i>roduct, forms the most healthful and 
nutritious cooking medium known to the food experts and medical profession ." 



WM. JAGO, F. I. C, F. C. S. 

That eminent chemist, William J ago, than whom there is no higher 

authority on cooking fats, reports as follows from Brighton, England: 

"I find Cottolene to consist practically of 100 per cent, pure fat, the following 
being the actual results obtained by analysis: Percentage of Pure Fat, 09.983. I 
found the 'shortening' effect of la ozs. of Cottolene practically equal to that of i lb. 
best butter. For hygienic reasons. Cottolene may be used witn safety as a perfectly 
harmless and innocuous substitute for other fats employed for dietetic purposes." 



Other eminent Physicians who have endorsed and recommended 
Cottolene are : Henry Seffmann, M. D., Professor of Chemistry, 
Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Prof. Jesse 
P. Battershall, Ph. S., F. C. S., Chemist U. S. Laboratory, New York; 
Dr. Allen McLane HamUton, New York, N. Y.; Dr. Edw. Smith, 
Analyst New York State Board of Health.

How to Meatsure 



Hne cup, or one tablespoon, or one teaspoon, means a full meas- 
ure — all it will hold of liquid, and even with the rim, or edge, of 
^"■"■"^ dry material. 
% Stir up all packed materials, like mustard in its box, and sift flour 

before mea!suring. Fill cup without shaking down, and dip spoon in 
material, taking up a heaped measure, then with a knife scrape off 
toward the tip till you have level measure. Pack butter or Cottolene 
in cup so there will be no air spaces. A scant cup means one-eighth less 
and a heaped cup about one-eighth more than a level cup. 

Divide a level spoon lengthwise for a half measure, and a half 
spoon crosswise for quarters or eighths. A pinch means about one- 
eighth, so does a saltspoon ; less than that means a dash or a few grains. 

A rounded tablespoon means filled above the rim as much as the 
spoon hollow below, and equals two of level measure. It also eqtfals 
one ounce in weight, and two rounded tablespoons if put together 
would heap a tablespoon about as high as would an egg, giving us the 
old-time measure of * ' butter size of an egg, ' * or two ounces, or one- 
fourth the cup. Butter and Cottolene and flour for sauces are com- 
monly measured by the rounded tablespoon by the experienced house- 
keeper. 

Except in delicate cake, or where it is creamed with sugar, and in 
pastry — where it should be chilled to make a flaky crust, Cottolene or 
butter may be most quickly and economically measured after it is 
melted. Keep a small supply in a granite cup, and when needed, stand 
the cup in hot water, and when melted, pour the amount desired into 
the spoon or cup. For all kinds of breakfast cakes, it is especially 
helpful to measure it in this way. 

Soda, cream of tartar, baking powder, salt and spices, and some 
extracts, are generally measured with a teaspoon, level measure, for 
this gives the proportional amount needed for the cup measure of 
other materials.

TEA 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use water freshly boiled. Scald 
the teapot (earthen, gianite or 
china); for mild infusions allow 
one-half teaspoon level for each 
cup. Pour the boiling water on 
the tea, cover closely and let it 
staftd and infuse, not boil, for five 
minutes. If you have a table 
teakettle, put the tea in a tea ball, 
fill two cups at a time with boil- 
ing water, hold the ball in the 
water till the desired strength is 
secured. At afternoon teas and 
for iced tea, serve lemon slices. 

CHOCOLATE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix two rounded tablespoons 
sugar, a few grains of salt, and 
one-half level teaspoon cornstarch 
in a granite saucepan, add two 
squares of unsweetened chocolate 
and one-fourth cup of cold water; 
stir over the fire until melted, 
thick and smooth. Add one cup 
of boiling water and when ready 
to serve add three cups scalded 
milk. Keep it hot over hot water 
until ready to serve. 

CAF]g NOIR 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Csd6 Noir (the French for black 
coffee) is made by dripping. It is 
also called '*drip cofiEee." Each half 
pint of water requires a heaping 
tablespoonful of coffee, ground to 
a powder. This powder is placed 



in a thick flannel cloth and laid in 
a strainer. The boihng (it must 
be boiling) water is poured over 
it and allowed to percolate into 
the pot. The flannel should not 
be porous, or the fine powder 
will also find its way through to 
the pot below. Like all other hot 
beverages, it should be served 
immediately^ 

BOILED COFFEE 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Boiled coffee is made by pour- 
ing a sufficient quantity, finely 
ground, into the pot; then pour 
in boiling water. This is al- 
lowed to boil, and then taken 
from the fire while the beaten 
white of an egg and the crushed 
shells are placed in the pot. Again 
place on the fire and let boil about 
one minute; remove and allow to 
stand a few minutes (not more 
than five) and serve. 

caf£ au lait 

(Miss Willis) 

Make coffee in a drip coffee pot, 
(or in an ordinary coffee pot with- 
out boiling it and immediately 
pouring it off the grounds), then 
add an equal quantity of good 
rich milk scalded to steaming 
point in a double boiler. Sweeten 
to suit the taste, cover and let 
heat over the boiling water for 
twenty minutes before serving. 
This coffee agrees with everyone 
and the dyspeptic and bilious 



BREAKFAST CAKES. FRITTERS. ETC.

who have been obliged to give up 
coffee because they cannot enjoy 
it without cream but suffer ill 
effects when cream is combined 
with rich coffee, suffer no incon- 
venience from drinking caf^ au 
lait. There is a logical and hy- 
gienic reason why this is so. 



MULLED GRAPE JUICE 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

To one pint grape juice add one 
cup water and half a cup of cassia 
buds, or several pieces of stick 
cinnamon. Heat in double boiler 
half an hour. Strain, and serve 
very hot as hrst course in luncheon. 



Breakfast Cakes, Fritters 
and Dou^Hnuts 

In preparing fritters, beat egg whites separately and add just before 
using. If intended for fruit, add a teaspoon of sugar, and if for meat 
or fish, a tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar. A thin batter is pre- 
ferable to a thick one. In frying doughnuts, fritters, etc., use plenty 
of Cottolene. Let it heat gradually, and be sure that it is hot enough 
before you begin to cook. When the frying is done, the Cottolene 
remaining can be carefully strained to use again. Never mix the fats 
in which doughnuts, vegetables or fish have been fried. Keep a sepa- 
rate vessel for each. 



BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Into two cups of sifted pastry 
flour, sift and mix one level tea- 
spoon of salt and four level or two 
rounded teaspoons baking pow- 
der; chop in one level tablespoon 
of chilled Cottolene, wet to a stiff 
dough with about three-fourths 
cup of milk, or half water and 
half milk. Toss out on a floured 
board, pat it down and roll one- 
half inch thick. Cut into small 
rounds and bake in a hot oven. 

SOUR MILK BISCXHT 

(Miss Willis) 

One quart flour; one table- 
spoon salt; one teaspoon soda; 
one pint sour milk. Sift the flour 
with salt and baking soda; flour 



or butter a baking pan and see 
that the oven is hot; wet the 
flour with a pint of sour milk, or 
enough to make a soft dough; 
add one tablespoon of Cottolene, 
by chopping it into the flour ; shape 
the biscuits quickly, put them 
into the pan and b^e them in a 
hot oven for about twenty 
minutes. 

CREAM BISCUIT (BAKING 
POWDER) 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Sift together one pint of pastry 
flour, three teaspoons of baking 
powder, and half a spoon of salt. 
Moisten with cream as soft as 
can be handled. Roll out on a 
well floured board, cut in small 
biscuits and place in a pan,

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



brushing over with melted butter 
or cream before baking. Have 
oven very hot, and bake ten or 
fifteen minutes, according to size. 
For milk biscuits use two table- 
spoons of Cottolene to shorten. 
Mixture like this made softer and 
baked in gem pans gives an easy 
and satisfactory drop biscuit. 

ONE-EGO MUFFINS OR 
QXnCK SALLY LUNN 

(Mi88 WilHs) 
/One and one-half tablespoons 
melted Cottolene ; one tablespoon 
sugar; one and one-half to one 
and three-quarters cup of milk; 
one egg; three cups sifted flour; 
three teaspoons baking powder; 
one scant teaspoon salt. Use 
more or less milk according to 
quality of flour. Sift baking 
powder and flour together; add 
butter, sugar, egg and milk. 

FRIED DROP CAKES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

With one-half cup flour, mix 
one-half saltspoon cinnamon, one- 
half level teaspoon soda and one 
level teaspoon baking powder. 
Add one cup sour milk, one-fourth 
cup molasses, one beaten egg, and 
rye meal or graham flour enough 
to make a soft dough that will 
hold in shape when dropped. 
Drop from a teaspoon into hot 
deep Cottolene. When they ttim 
over and are brown, try with a 
fork — if it comes out clean, they 
are done. 

SCALDED CORN MEAL CAKES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Known also as Dabs or Hoe 
Cakes. Mix one-fourth level tea- 



spoon salt with one cup fine 
white com meal (Rhode Island 
and Southern varieties preferred ) . 
Scald with boiling water sufficient 
to wet and swell every grain and 
have the mixture barely hold to- 
gether. Then thin with cold milk 
to a soft dough that will keep its 
shape. Drop from a tablespoon 
on a griddle well greased with 
Cottolene, or butter, or salt pork 
fat. Shape them as they cook, 
turn them round for uniform 
browning and turn *over wheb 
brown on one side. When done, 
let them stand in the oven for a 
few minutes. They absorb a deal 
of fat in cooking, and when ready 
to turn, put a bit on each, that 
the fresh side may be equally 
well browned. 

SHORTCAKE 

(Mrs. Ltn(U>ln) 

Add to the Baking-Powder Bis- 
cuit formula, twice the amount of 
Cottolene, or use only three level 
teaspoons of baking powder, and 
add one egg if you prefer. When 
baked pull the biscuit apart, 
spread with butter and put 
mashed and sweetened berries or 
other fruit, between the crusts 
and over, the whole. The biscuits 
are more easily served than large 
cakes. 

POPOVERS 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Beat two large or three small 
eggs well; mix carefully two cups 
flour, half teaspoon of salt and 
two cups of milk with eggs. Pour 
into hot greased irons and bake 
in rather hot oven half an hour 
or more, according to size. Serve 
promptly.

half cup sugar; Cottolene, about 
the size of a small egg, melted 
and added last thing, one tea- 
spoon soda added to the milk. 
Add to the beaten eggs the milk 
and meal alternately, then the 
Cottolene and sugar. Bake 
twenty minutes in hot oven. 

GRIDDLE CAKES 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

One cup ef sifted flour, (one-third 
of this cup may be entire wheat, 
or fine com meal, or rye meal). 
Before mixing, sift on the flour 
one-half level teaspoon each of 
salt and soda, and one level tea- 
spoon of baking powder. Mix, 
and add one beaten egg and one 
tablespoon of melted Cottolene; 
if the milk is one-third cream, 
omit the Cottolene. Beat well 
and cook on a griddle, greased 
slightly with Cottolene. Flours 
and meals vary, and if the first 
cake is not right, add more flour 
or moisture, as needed. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

At. night mix one cup graham 
flour, two cups buckwheat, one 
level teaspoon salt, and moisten 
with warm water to make thick 
batter. Add two tablespoons 
molasses and one-half cake com- 
pressed yeast, softened in a little 
water. Cover, and let it rise. 
In the morning, stir the batter 
down and thin it, if needed, with 



warm water; and if there be any 
sour odor, add one-fourth lev^ 
teaspoon soda dissolved in a little 
water. When all is ready for 
breakfast, fry the cakes as wanted 
on a griddle greased slightly with 
Cottolene. In all frying on a 
griddle, use only fat enough to 
give a slight film of grease — any 
more than this makes extra work 
for you by burning on and filling 
the room with smoke. 

HEW ENGLAND DOUGHNUTS 

(Miss WHUs) 

One quart sifted flour, one-half 
teaspoon salt, one-fourth teaspoon 
grated nutmeg, three teaspoons 
baking powder. Sift all together 
until mixed. Beat two eggs light 
with two ounces (four tablespoons 
or one-fourth cup) Cottolene and 
one cup granulated sugar. Add 
one cup milk and the sifted flour. 
Some qualities of flour require a 
little more milk to make a soft 
dough. Roll out about one-half 
inch thick and cut with a ring 
cutter. When all are cut out, 
have ready the fr3ring kettle with 
sufficient hot Cottolene to float 
the doughnuts while frying. Test 
with a piece of the dough. If it 
comes immediately 'to the surface 
it is hot enough to begin frying. 
Cook about three minutes, turn- 
ing frequently to keep them 
smooth and like balls. When 
taken from the fat, dust with 
powdered sugar and cinnamon. 

RAISED DOUGHNUTS

with two eggs and one teaspoon 
melted Cottolene. Mix a little 
nutmeg, or cinnamon, with one- 
foiirth cup of flour; add this, and 
enough more flour to make a stiff 
dough. Roll and cut, and let 
them rise half an hour before 
frying in deep, hot Cottolene. 

APPLE FRITTERS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Three tart apples; two eggs, one 
cup milk, one teaspoon salt, 
about one and one-half cups flour, 
one teaspoon baking powder. 

Pare and core the apples; cut 
them into rings; dust with sugar 
and cinnamon ; stand aside to use. 
Beat eggs without separatmg, 
until light; add milk, salt and 
sufficient flour to make a soft 
batter; beat well and add the 
baking powder; beat again. 
Have ready, very hot, a deep pan 
of Cottolene, dip each ring of 
apple in the batter, drop it in the 
Cottolene and fry until brown. 
Serve hot, dusted with powdered 
sugar. 

FRUIT FRITTERS 

(Miss Wiltis) 
Almost any kind of fine fruit may 
be served in the form of fritters. 
Apples, bananas, pears, oranges, 
peaches, etc., are all suitable for 
this form of entr^. Apples 
should be pared, cored and cut 
into round slices about half an 
inch thick. They may be sea- 
soned with a little lemon juice 
and nutmeg, if these flavors be 
liked. Bananas should be cut in 
round slices about an inch thick; 
or, they may be cut in halves and 



split. Pears may be cut in quarters, 
while oranges may be divided 
into sections or cut in slices, care 
being taken to remove the seeds. 
For six people use: One-half 
pint flour, one gill milk, two tea- 
spoons sugar, one-half teaspoon 
salt, two tablespoons melted but- 
ter and two eggs. 

RICE CAKES 

(Miss WUlis) 
Half pound rice, four and one- 
half ounces Cottolene, one quart 
milk, four eggs, one-half pound 
flour, one teaspoon baking pow- 
der, a little salt. 

Soak the rice, boil soft, drain 
and mix with the Cottolene; let 
cool, add the milk, salt and eggs. 
Sift in a quarter of a pound of 
flour with a teaspoon of baking 
powder. Bake on well* greased 
griddle. 

POTATO PANCAKES 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

To one quart of raw potato, either 
grated or run through food chop- 
per, add four eggs singly, beating 
each one in thoroughly. Add salt 
and pepper and a little flour, only, 
enough to bind the mixture; tl""' 
amount will vary owing to diffewa 
ence in potatoes. Fry by the 
spoonful in drippings or Cottolene 
and serve promptly. 

GERMAN CRULLERS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Two eggs; one cup sugar; one 
tablespoon Cottolene ; one cup of 
milk; two cups flour; oi^ tea- 
spoon baking powder; nutmeg; 
flour. 



BREAD AND ROUL8 



15 



Beat the eggs until light, add 
sugar, melted Cottolene and milk; 
mix and add about two cups of 
flour and one teaspoon baking 
powder, sifted together; beat 



well ; add grating of nutmeg and 
sufficient flour to make a soft 
dough ; knead lightly ; roll out, cut 
and fry in very hot Cottolene. 
Dust with powdered sugar. 



Bread and Rolls 

Cottolene is wholly adapted to all uses in the kitchen where lard is used 
and in the majority of cases where butter is used. It makes lighter 
biscuit than lard, and be they ever so rich, they are never greasy. It 
is more economical, requiring one-third less than either butter or lard. 
It has no peculiar flavor, no coloring matter and no salt, and in general 
use the amount of salt required with lard shotild always be used. 

Bread and rolls should rise in a moderately warm place. If in too 
cold a place it will be heavy, and if in too hot, sour. In the case of 
soured dough, a tpaspoon of soda will correct the sourness of the dough, 
but will not bring back the sweetness of the flour. Bread should rise 
to twice its original size before it is ready to bake, and small loaves 
are always preferable to large ones. 

Rolls and all baking-powder bread require a hotter oven than a 
yeast-raised bread. In using baking 4>owder always sift it twice with 
the flour. A teaspoon of baking powder to each pint of flour is a 
good proportion. 



TEAST BREAD 
Gnmdmother's Way 

(Miss Willis) 
Place VI your bread or mixing 
bowl one heaping teaspoon of 
GpHtolene, one teaspoon of salt, 
nd one teaspoon of sugar. Pour 
over these one pint of milk which 
has been heated to steaming 
point and stir until the salt and 
sugar are dissolved, then allow to 
cool. When lukewarm, add one- 
half cup of yeast or one-half a 
compressed yeast cake dissolved 
in a little lukewarm water. Then 
stir in enough flour to make a 
rather stiff batter. Beat vigor- 
ously tmtil the batter is perfectly 



smooth and /till of air bubbles. 
Cover with a cloth and lid to 
exclude the air and set in a warm 
place to rise. The kitchen table 
is near enough the fire in summer. 
In the winter have a temperature 
of about seventy degrees Fahr. 
When the batter doubles its bulk 
and is light and spongy stir into it 
sufficient flour to make a moder- 
ately stiff dough (soft as can be 
handled makes lighter bread). 
Flour your bread board. Turn 
out the dough and knead lightly 
and quickly until it becomes 
smooth and elastic and will not 
stick to the hands or board. 
Return to the bowl, cover as

before, and set to rise again. When 
the dough doubles its bulk place 
again on the moulding board and 
separate into two loaves. Mold 
and turn into well greased bread 
pans and cover and set to rise 
again. When the loaves double 
their original bulk place in a 
moderately quick oven and bake 
for three-quarters of an hour. 

MILKBRBAD 

(ICn. Lincoln) 

(Without kneading.) Scald one 
cup of n:iilk and melt in it one 
level teaspoon Cottolene, one 
level teaspoon sugar and one-half 
level teaspoon salt. When cool, 
add one-half cake compressed 
yeast softened in one-half cup 
lukewarm water. Stir in about 
one and one-half cups of white 
flour, or enough to make a drop 
batter after beating well. Cover 
and place the bowl in a pan of 
warm water as hot as you can 
bear your' hand in. Keep the 
water at the, same temperature 
until the batter is full of bubbles, 
about an hour. Stir in enough 
more flour to make a dough that 
will keep up round after you stop 
stirring. Cut through, and turn 
over with a broad knife, and if it 
settles to a level it needs a trifle 
more flour. Cut and stir it till no 
dry flour is seen, then cover and 
stand again in the pan of warm 
water, and after another hour it 
should be doubled in bulk. If 
you are not ready to attend to it 
then, cut it away from the bowl, 
turn the dougli over and over and 
let it rise again fo;^ a short time. 



This liberates some of the gas 
and prevents the fermentation 
going on to the sotir state. Toss 
out on floured board and shape 
into one long loaf, or divide and 
make two round loaves — place 
them close together in a brick 
loaf pan and let rise till doubled 
in bulk. Then bake in hot oven 
about forty minutes. Remove 
and stand on end till cooL 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD 

(Mrs. Uncobi) 
Mix one pint of com meal and one 
pint of rye meal; or, if rye is not 
liked, use graham meal; or use 
one cup of rolled oatmeal and one 
cup of white flour with the pint of 
com meal. Add one level tea- 
spoon salt, one level teaspoon 
baking powder, two level tea- 
spoons soda, and moisten with 
one pint of sour milk, or butter- 
milk, and one cup molasses. If 
too stifl, thin with a little water, 
after beating well. Grease pound 
size baking powder cans with 
Cottolene and half fill with the 
batter, cover, and steam three 
hours. Half a cup of seeded 
raisins or stewed prunes, cut 
small, n^y be mixed into the 
batter.

SALT-RISING BREAD 

(Miss Willis) 

One pint of new milk, com meal 
to thicken, one gallon flour, one 
tablespoon sugar one teaspoon 
salt, pinch soda. 

Set the milk on the fire and 
stir in com meal to make as thick 
as mush. Set in a warm place 
all night. In the morning it will 
be light. Put the flour in a bowl^ 
pour in the mush and mix with 
warm milk and water, equal parts; 
add the sugar, salt and soda. 
Make a stiff batter, cover and keep 
wasm. In an hour it will be light. 
Work in flour to make stiff dough, 
let it rise, mold in loaves, put in 
greased pans, let it rise and bake. 
This makes the sweetest and most 
wholesome bread a family can use. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Soften one cake of compressed 
yeast in one-fourth cup of water. 
Sift a scant <|uart of whole wheat 
flour into a bowl, with two tea- 
spoons of salt and one - f eurth 
cup of sugar, and make into a 
batter with a pint of warm milk 
and the yeast. Beat well and 



work in sifted flour until the 
bread can be handled lightly on 
the board. Place in greased 
bpwl, cover well and leave in a 
warm place. Shape into two small 
loaves when light and bake in a 
moderate oven about forty-five 
minutes, brushing with soft butter 
just before placing them in the 
oven. For nut loaves a cup and 
a half of sliced nuts (pecans and 
English walnuts) may be added 
with the flour. 

SALLY LUHN 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Sift together one* pint of flour, 
two tablespoons of sugar and a 
little salt. Warm a scant cup of 
milk and melt in this two table- 
spoons of Cottolene. Stir into 
the flotir, adding also a half cak|e 
of compressed yeast dissolved in 
a little lukewarm water.- Beat 
very well; add one egg, y«lk and 
white beaten separately. Pour 
all into buttered cake pan and let 
rise until double its bulk, about 
two hours. Sprinkle lij^ly with 
granulated sugar and bake in a 
moderately hot oven. Serve 
warm, cut into squares. If set 
over night for breakfast, Mie- 
fourth as much yeast is required. 

MILK ROLLS 

(Mrs. 'Lincoln) 

Proceed as for Milk Bread, but 
instead of shaping into ttnaves, 
divide the d«it(h into smKlfi por- 
tions and roll each with yourJland 
into rotmd shape for common 
biscuit. Bake them in muffin 
pans if liked crusty, or roll each

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



ball under the hand on the board 
until about a finger's length. 
Place them dose together in two 
rows in a long, shallow pan, with 
a bit of softened butter between, 
if you like them richer. Some dip 
one edge of each roll in melted 
butter before placing in the pan. 
Other varieties may be made from 
this same soft dough. Roll into 
long strips and plait three to- 
gether, making a braid or simply 
twist two together, or bake each 
in a long strip, or stick, or tie a 
bow-knot, or join in rings, or link 
several rings together. 

French Rolls are made by roll- 
ing dough between the hands into 
small oval shapes about a finger 
long, tapering at each end, and 
put together in pairs; or rolling 
into egg-shaped pieces and cutting 
them half through the middle. 
Another shape is first a ball, then 
cut it half through each way, top 
to bottom, and right to left. 
Long rolls are shaped and cut 
across in slanting cuts; or the 
whole mass of dough is rolled 
under the hand and made into a 
large ring, pinching the ends to- 
gether; then cut half way through, 
two inches apart, with a scissors. 
A knife dipped in melted Cottolene 
keeps these cuts from coming 
together. 

OTHER ROLLS 

(Urs. Lincoln) 

Two thin rounds with thin coat- 
ing of butter between will give 
you a Sandwich Roll, that will 
pull apart easily after baking. 
A thin piece about four inches 



square, divided diagonally, and 
each half rolled from the broad 
side toward the point, and the 
ends curved round like a horse- 
shoe, gives the Crescent shape. 
All of these varieties may be made 
from this formula for Milk Bread, 
and will save you the trouble 
of remembering many recipes. 
If you do not care for shorten- 
ing, or sugar, in bread, simply 
omit them; and if you like a 
richer roll, add more butter to the 
second mixing. Rolls should rise 
in the pans slowly; and when 
making both bread and rolls, 
bake the bread first; rolls should 
rise all they will before bakings 
and the oven should be hot enough 
for them to brown almost at 
once, and thus check any further 
rising in the oven. Being small, 
the heat penetrates through them 
quickly and sets the dough cells. 
In the loaf, however, which is 
thicker, son>e time is required for 
the heat to reach the center, and 
the dough goes on rising in the 
oven till the center cells are check- 
ed; therefore, it should not rise 
too long in the pan, and the heat 
for bread should be sufficient to 
arrest this rising before the cells 
break and run together, making 
a large hole in the loaf. Rolls 
are made more crisp by rubbing 
the crust with butter, twisted 
into a bit of doth, as soon as they 
come from oven. 

QXnCK COFFEE CAKE 

(Mrs. Annstrons) 

Sift togeUier twice, one pint of

three teaspoons of baking powder 
and a half teaspoon each of salt 
and ground cinnamon. Mix to a 
soft dough with about half a cup 
of milk stirred into a well beaten 
egg. Add three tablespoons of 
melted Cottolene, spread in a 
shallow pan, sprinkle with sugar 
mixed with cinnamon, and bake 
in a moderate oven. 

CINNAMON BUNS 

(Miss Willis) 

Scald a pint of milk ; add a quar- 
ter pound of Cottolene, two table- 
spoons of sugar and one yeast 



cake, dissolved; add two eggs, 
well beaten, and sufficient flour 
to make a soft dough. Knead 
lightly; put aside in a warm place. 
When very light roll into a sheet ; 
spread with butter and dust with 
sugar and then with currants. 
Cut into buns. Stand them in a 
greased pan, and when very light 
bake in a moderate oven three- 
quarters of an hour. 



BfRS. JANET M. HILL, Editor Boston 
CooUns School Magaxin* says : " For 
•ereral years I hare used COTTOLENE 
In my kitchen and And it Tery satiafactory. 
I am glad to recommend it." 




There are a few golden rules to be remembered in cake making. Beat 
the Cottolene and sugar together until very light before putting in the 
other materials; then add the yolks of the eggs, the liquid (either water 
or milk), then the flour, with which you have sifted the baking xwwder, 
and lastly the whites of eggs. 

Here again remember that one-third less Cottolene must be used 
than butter or lard in the same recipe. 

Sweet milk will make a cake rich and close; water in the same 
cake will make it light and delicate. ^ 

In nearly all recipes beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately. 

Always sift the flour before measuring, then add the baking powder 
and sift again once or twice. 

Pastry flour makes a much lighter cake than bread flour; where 
real pastry flour cannot be obtained, the soft winter white flour will 
answer the purpose. 



GENUINE OLD-TIME SPONGE 
CAKE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

The weight of the eggs in sugar, 
and half their weight in flour. 
This enables you to make a cake 
of any size you desire. The usual 



proportion for one loaf, by meas- 
ure, is four large or five small 
eggs, one cup of fine granulated 
sugar, and one cup of sifted pastry 
flour, the grated rind and juice of 
half a lemon. Beat yolks till 
thick and very creamy, add sugar. 



20 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



and beat till light colored; add 
lemon. Beat whites till stiff and 
nearly dry, and fold them in with 
care, se as not to break down the 
bubbles, sift in the flour lightly, 
and fold over (not stir) till just 
barely covered. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven from forty to fifty 
minutes. You will look far to 
find a better sponge cake than 
this when properly made and 
baked. 

ONE EGG CAKE 

(Bffrs. Lincoln) 
One-third cup Cottolene, one cup 
sugar, one egg, one teaspoon 
vanilla, one-half teaspoon soda, 
one teaspoon cream of tartar, two 
cups flour, one cup milk. 

Rub the Cottelene and sugar to 
a light cream ; add the well beaten 
yolk of egg and vanilla. Mix 
together the soda, cream of tartar 
and flour, and stir into the sugar 
mixture alternately with the milk. 
Add the well beaten white of egg 
last. Bake in a shallow pan in a 
moderate oven about half an 
hour. Two level teaspoons of 
baking powder may be used in- 
stead of the soda and cream of 
tartar. 

SUNSHINE CAKE 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Have ready one cup sifted granu- 
lated sugar, also two-thirds cup 
of flour with two-thirds teaspoon 
cream of tartar sifted four times. 
Beat seven whites of eggs very 
light, with speck of salt, add 
sugar gently, then the yolks 
beaten thick and light, then flour 



and scant teaspoon extract lemon 
or orange. Bake in ungteased 
pan slowly ab«ut fifty minutes 
and cool in pan inverted. Re- 
move from the pan and cover 
thickly with sweetened and fla- 
vored whipped cream. Garnish 
with candied cherries or nuts and 
serve. 

ALMOND CREAM CAKE 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Cream one-half cup of butter and 
Cottolene packed together, add 
one cup of sugar, and mix in al- 
ternately one-half cup of milk or 
water and two cups of pastry 
flour sifted three times with two 
teaspoons baking powder. Beat 
well, flavor and add five stiffly- 
beaten whites. Bake in two 
layers. 

Whip sweetened cream until 
stiff; flavor with almond extract 
and sherry ; add chopped blanched 
almonds and spread between and 
over the layers. Garnish with 
cherries. 

DIXIE CAKE

One-fourth pound Cottolene, one 
pound flour, two eggs, three- 
quarters pound sugar, one level 
teaspoon mixed cloves, cinnamon 
and allspice, powdered, one wine- 
glass brandy and rose water. 

Chop the Cottolene into the 
flour, beat the eggs and sugar to a 
cream; stir these ingredients 
with the spices; add the brandy 
and sufficient rose water to make 
a soft cake dough; put the cake 
mixture into small buttered cake

OIRASGE LATER CAKE 

(Miss Willis) 

Cream one-half cup Cottolene 
with one cup sugar until very 
light. Add three eggs, one at a 
time, beating each one in five 
minutes before adding another. 
Sift two teaspoons of baking 
powder with two cups sifted 
flour, mixing thoroughly, and 
add to the other materials, alter- 
nating with a half cup of milk 
or water (water, if the cake 
is to be eaten while fresh). 
Beat batter well after all ingre- 
dients are in. Bake in two layers 
in a moderately hot oven for about 
twenty minutes. 

poxnn> CAKE 

(Miss WilUs) 
Scant one-fourth pound Cotto- 
lene; one-half pound sugar; six 
€ggs ; one-half pound flour ; vanilla 
extract. 

The excellence of this cake de- 
pends entirely upon the rapidity 
and lightness with which the bat- 
ter is beaten, and sometimes sev- 
eral efforts are necessary before 
it proves a perfect success in the 
making and baking. The baking 
has everjrthing to do with success; 
the cake pan should be lined with 
soft writing JDaper, and a test of 
the oven made to see if the tem- 
perature is right — if a piece of 
writing paper turns brownish- 
yellow when left in the oven for 



two or three minutes the heat is 
right for baking cake. Put in a 
mixing ImwI half apotmd of sugar, 
beaten to a cream with a scant 
half pound of Cettolene, and beat 
one egg into them for two minutes, 
until six eggs have been used, 
beating each egg twe minutes. 
Flavor with twenty drops of the 
strongest vanilla extract. Last 
of all sift in the half pound of 
flour, beating all the time until a 
smooth light fatter is formed; 
this should be carefully baked as 
directed above. The French pas- 
try cooks beat cake batter with 
the hand.

CREAM PUFFS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

One cup hot water; one-half 
teaspoon salt; one- third cup 
Co-ttolene ; one and one-half cups 
pastry flour; four eggs. 

Put on water, salt and Cotto- 
lene to boil; the instant it boils 
all over add the flour all at once; 
stir well until it cleaves from the 
pan; it will take about five 
minutes. Let the mixture cool, 
then add the eggs, one at a time, 
and beat each egg in thoroughly 
before adding another. When 
well mixed, drop in small table- 
spoonfuls, on a buttered baking 
pan, some distance apart to allow 
for spreading. Bake about thirty 
minutes in a hot oven until well 
risen, then decrease the heat and 
be careful to bake them until 
done. Split when cool and fill 
with cream. 

Cream for Cream Puffs. — One 
pint milk boiled ; two tablespoons 
cornstarch; three eggs, well 
beaten; three-fourths cup sugar;

if the milk is creamy). Beat 
well, and bake in muffin tins. 

COCOA TEA CAKES 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Cream a scant half cup of Cotto- 
lene and beat into it i gradually 
one cup of sugar. Then beat in 
three eggs, singly, until the mix- 
ture is light and smooth. Add 
alternately one-half cup of milk 
and about a cup and two-thirds 
of flour sifted with two teaspoons 
of baking powder and a quarter of 
a cup of cocoa. Beat well and

muffin tins or a shallow pan. Nuts 
may be a'ided, if desired. 

GINGER SNAPS 

(Miss Willis) 

Half pint sugar, one-half pint 
molasses, one-half pint Cottolene, 
one gill cold water, one tablespoon 
ginger, one-half tablespoon cinna- 
mon, one teaspoon soda, one tea- 
spoon salt ; three pints flour. 

Beat the Cottolene in a warm 
mixing bowl until soft and creamy. 
Gradually beat the sugar and 
molasses into this, and then add 
the salt and spice. Dissolve the 
soda in the cold water and stir 
this in. Now graduallv work in 



the flour, beating well. Put a 
small piece of the dough on a 
floured board and roll as thin as 
a wafer. Cut into round cakes 
and bake on a greased pan in 
rather a quick oven. If there 
be time, these cakes may be 
rolled thinner and with greater 
ease if the mixture be chilled 
before being rolled. 

SOFT MOLASSES COOKIES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Scald one cup molasses, pour it 
over one-fourth cup Cottolene, 
add one-half cup sugar, one-half 
level teaspoon salt, and one level 
tablespoon ginger, or a mixture 
of other spices if preferred. Dis- 
solve one-half level teaspoon soda ^ 
in one-fourth cup cold water, 
add to the cooled molasses, then 
stir in from three to four cups 
flour, making a soft dough to drop 
and spread in a pan, or a stiff 
dough to be rolled and cut. Bake 
in moderate oven. 

SOFT FROSTING 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Stir one level teaspoon butter, 
one-fourth cup milk and one cup 
sugar till it boils, then boil with-

strained juice of a small thin- 
skinned orange and the grated 
yellow rind. Beat in enough 
confectioner's sugar to make an 
icing stiff enough to spread. A 
tablespoon of lemon juice im- 
proves this icing. 

MAPLE CREAM FILLING 

(Miss Willis) 

Three-fourths cup maple sugar 
and one level tablespoon Cotto- 
lene or two of butter, cooked until 
it spins a thread. Then pour 
graduaHy into stiffly beaten whites 
of two eggs. Beat until smooth 
and add half a cup of cream whip- 
ped to a stiff dry foam. Flavor 
with a few drops of vanilla. 

CHOCOLATE FROSTING 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Shave three squares of chocolate 
and add one cup of sugar and one- 
fourth cup of milk. Cook this 



over hot water until thick, add 
two beaten egg yolks and cook 
until smooth; then remove and 
spread on cake. 

CARAMEL NUT FILLING 

(Miss WalUs) 
Three cups brown coffee suga/, 
one-half cup cream or condensed 
milk and one-fourth cup water, 
one tablespoon butter, one tea-

gredients except vanilla, about 
five minutes. Remove from the 
fire, add the flavoring and beat 
until it begins to thicken, add 
one-half cup or two-thirds cup 
nut meats and spread. 



Dr. Jsmes Paige Emery, la an article 
in tlie "American Housekeeper" entitled 
**TheMost Healthfal of All Cooking Fats/* 
says: "Cottolene, being essentially a veg- 
etable product, forms the most healthful 
and nutritious cooking medium known to 
food experts and the medical profession." 




BOILED EGGS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

In a covered stew-pan have sufi&- 
dent boiling water to more than 
cover the eggs. Drop them in 
when water boils, using a spoon 
to prevent cracking; when boil- 
ing begins again cover them, turn 
off the heat and let them stand — 
six to eight minutes for soft tex- 
ture, and ten for medium, boil 
gently twenty minutes for hard. 
Fresh eggs are fuller, contain more 
albumen than when older, and 



take longer time for cooking. 
Eggs cooked six minutes in an 
uncovered pan with water bub- 
bling gently all over, will have a 
firm but not hard texture to the 
white and the yolk will be like 
thick cream, not running over 
the white when cut. 

FRIED EGGS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Boil six eggs twenty minutes, and 
remove shells. Cook one-half cup 
of stale bread crumbs in one-half 
cup of milk, to a smooth paste;

mix with it one cup fine chopped 
tongue, ham or chicken; season 
with salt and pepper, add one raw 
egg and when well ,mixed take a 
portion, about one-sixth, and 
make it about half an inch thick, 
put an egg in center and work up 
the paste until the egg is covered. 
Roll in a slight coating of fine 
bread crumbs and fry about two 
minutes in hot deep Cottolene. 

POACHED EGGS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Drop perfect eggs in a sufficient 
amount of boiling water to cover; 
do not allow them to boil; but 
let them steam until the white is 
jelly-like and the yolk entirely 
covered. Servd on toast. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

(Miss Willis) 

Take a small piece of butter and 
a little cream, warm in a fr3ring 
pan. Break six eggs in it and stir 
until slightly cooked. Serve hot. 
Or, scramble in Cottolene. 

CREAM OMELET 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Allow from one to two tablespoons 
of thick cream for each egg. Beat 
till well mixed but not frothy; 



season lightly with salt and pep- 
per, and cook in portions (not 
more than two eggs at a time) in 
hot omelet pan, greased slightly 
with Cottolene or butter. Draw 
the egg back toward the middle 
(tip the pan to help it to run 
there) a^ it thickens, and when 
all the egg is set, or does not flow 
when pan is tipped, turn one-half 
over and toss out on a hot dish. 
If other seasonings like minced 
ham, parsley, cheese, oysters, etc., 
are desired, add them just before 
folding. 

OMELET WITH CHEESE 

(Miss Willis) 

Four eggs, one-half cup milk, one 
teaspoon flour, a little parsley, 
pepper and salt, one-half teaspoon 
grated cheese, one tablespoon 
Cottolene. 

Beat the eggs very light and 
then add the other ingredients.. 
Beat all well together and pour 
into a pan in which a large table- 
spoon of Cottolene is heated. Let 
it cook till light brown, then fold 
it over and dish for the table. 
Shake the pan while the omelet 
is cooking. Must be eaten the 
instant it is removed from the pan. 



FisK and Shell FisK 



Salt mackerel and other small salt fish should be broiled. Small pan 
fish and steaks of large white dry fish are good fried. Fresh salmon, 
mackerel and bluefish are oily fish and should not be fried. Boil oily 
fish if large — broil them if small. 0>d, haddock, bluefish, small 
salmon, bass and shad may be stuffed atnd baked whole.

-FRIED FISH 

(lin. Lincoln) 
Fry smelts, perch ^ trout, butter 
fish, herring and other small pan 
fish whole. Cut large fish in 
inch tHick slices, and two or three 
inches square; flounders and bass, 
strip off the flesh ecu^h side of bone 
in long fillets, divide in halves 
and roll up toward tip. Remove 
skin and bones as much as possible 
from sliced fish; wipe dry, roll in 
bread crumbs or fine meal, then 
in beaten egg and then in crumbs 
and fry in deep Cottolene, hot 
enough to brown a bit of bread 
while you count sixty. Drain 
well before serving. Or, simply 
cover with seasoned meal and 
brown on each side in hot Cotto- 
lene in frying pan. 

SALT CODFISH 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Cover with cold water and strip 
into bits; soak over night. Heat 
dowly and simmer ten minutes 
just off the boiling point. Drain 
and stir it into one cup white 
sauce (see page 41), add one 
beaten egg just before serving. 
Serve hot with baked potatoes. 
Or mix with an equal amount of 
boiled potatoes, add butter, salt 
and pepper, and drop from a 
tablespoon into hot Cottelene in 
spider; shape out flat and roimd 
as they codk and turn when one 
side is brown. 

Large flakes of salt codfish, if 
not very ds^ may be scordied 
on4he<coals, ox^broHed and served 
with batter. A tempting relish. 



BROILED FISH 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

The best method for mackerel, 
whitefish, small bluefish, and shad : 
CLean, wipe, split down back, lay 
in greased wire broiler (kept only 
for fish) and cook flesh side first, 
over hot coals till brown. For 
dry fish like halibut, cod, etc., 
spread with butter after they are 
warmed through, to help* the 
browning. Turn the broiler and 
cook skin side till crisp. Slide 
out oil a platter, season with salt, 
pepper, butter and lemon juice. 
To broil under gas, lay the broiler 
over a pan to catch the dripping 
fat, and keep this pan only for 
fish. 

CREAMED FISH 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Pick into flakes, sufficient cold 
cooked fish , to make one pint. 
Rub together one rounding table- 
spoon of butter, and one of 
flour; add a half pint of milk, 
stir until boiling, add one table- 
spoon of salt, a saltspoon of black 
pepper and the fish. Heat and 
serve in a border of .mashed pota- 
toes. 

BAKED FISH 

(Miss Willis) 

Have the fish drawn from the 
gills if possible. Stuff with fol- 
lowing: Season a pint of soft 
bread crumbs with salt, pepper 
and onion juice to taste. Add a 
tablespoon chopped parsley and 
mdx weQ, then moisten with 
crumbs with melted butter. About 
two tablespoons of fat salt oork

minced fine makes a richer dress- 
ing. Sew up the fish to retain 
stuffing and on the upper side 
lard the fish with bits of fat salt 
pork. Bake froth thirty to forty 
minutes in good oven. A few 
chopped gherkins or pickles may 
be mixed with the stuffing, es- 
pecially with bluefish. 

FISH BALLS 

(Min Wmis) 

One pint of shredded salt fish, 
ten potatoes of medium size, one 
^gg, one tablespoon of butter, 
one-quarter teaspoon of pepper; 
one-half teaspoon 'of salt, Cotto- 
lene for frying. 

Have the salt codfish shredded 
rather fine and freed from bones. 
Pare the potatoes and put them 
in a large stewpan. Sprinkle the 
fish over the potatoes and cover 
with boiling water. Place on the 
fire and cook for just thirty 
minutes. Drain off every drop 
of the water and mash the fish 
and potatoes fine and light. Now 
add the butter, salt, pepper and 
egg, well beaten. Beat for three 
minutes; then shape into smooth 
balls about the size of a small egg. 
Put into the fr3ring basket and 
fry about five minutes. 

If it be inconvenient to use the 
frying basket the fish balls may be 
dropped into the hot fat and, 
when browned, be taken out with 
a fork. Be sure that the fat is 
hot enough, and do not crowd 
the fish balls. Six or eight will 
be enough to fry at one time. 



FISH IN VENETIAN STYLE 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Almost any firm fish can be used 
for this dish, either cut into slices 
or split open and boned. Place 
the fish in a shallow baking pan 
and sprinkle with lemon jtiice, 
adding also salt and pepper. 
Have in readiness one-fourth cup 
each of celery and carrot and 
two tablespoons each of green 
pepper and parsley, with one of 
onion, all chopped together very 
fine. Simmer this for ten minutes 
with one-fourth cup of olive oil, 
then spread over the fish, cover 
closely with another pan and bake 
until fish is done, from twenty to 
thirty minutes. 

FISH CUTLETS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Half pint milk, three teaspoons 
Cottolene, three even tablespoons

paste is formed, add the yolk of 
egg, parsley, onion juice, mix and 
add the boiled fish; mix again 
and add a palatable seasoniag of 
sallf and cayenne; turn out to cool. 
When cold form into cutlets or 
croquettes. Dip first in beaten 
egg, then in bread crumbs, and 
fry in very hot Cottolene. Drain 
on brown paper and serve very 
hot with cream sauce.

FRIED OYSTERS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use large oysters, parboil a mo- 
ment to draw out some of the 
juice and prevent spattering dur-

seasoned bread crumbs, beaten 
egg, and again in bread crumbs 
and brown a few at a time, in deep 
smoking-hot Cottolene. 

CREAMED OYSTERS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Parboil one pint of solid oysters 
till edges curl. Drain and add to 
the liquor, milk or thin cream 
enough to make one and one-half 
cups. Melt two tablespoons but- 
ter or Cottolene in saucepan and 
cook in it for five minutes (without 
browning) one teaspoon minced 
onion, one tablespoon minced 
sweet pepper, green or red, and 
one tablespoon minced celery. 
Stir in two tablespoons flour and 
when blended add gradually the 
hot liquid, stir till smooth, add the 
oysters, cook a moment longer 
and serve in the pie. Or, if you 
prefer, you may invert the deep 
pan, lay the paste over, and fit it 
to the bottom^ and sides and bake 
it, baking also a portion cut to fit 
the pan for a cover, on another 
plate. When done, remove the 
baked crust (or shell), fill with 
oysters, cover with the cooked 
top, and serve in a deep table dish. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

(Marion Harland) 

Crush and roll several handfuls 
of Boston or other friable crack-

a buttered pudding dish. Wet this 



with a mixture of the oyster liquor 
and milk, slightly warmed. Next 
have a layer of oysters. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and lay 
small bits of Cottolene upon them. 
Then anothei" layer of moistened 
crumbs, and so on until the dish 
is ftiU. Let the top layer be of 
crumbs, thicker than the rest 
and beat an egg into the milk you 
pour over them. Stick bits of 
Cottolene thickly over it, cover 
the dish, set it in the oven, bake 
half an hour; if the dish be large, 
remove the cover, and brown by 
setting it upon the upper grating 
of oven, or by holding a hot shovel 
over it.

DEVILED CRABS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Twelve nice heavy crabs, one- 
half pint cream, two tablespoons 
flour, one-quarter grated nutmeg, 
four egg yolks, boiled hard, one 
tablespoon each of salt, butter 
and chopped parsley, salt and 
cayenne to taste. 

Put the crabs in warm water; 
add the salt and put the kettle 
over a brisk fire. Boil thirty 
minutes. Take up and (^ain; 
break off all claws; separate the 
shells; remove the spongy fingers 
and the stomach, which is found 



under the head. Pick out all the 
meat. Put the cream on to boil, 
rub butter and flour together and 
addto the boiling cream; stir and 
cook two minutes. Take from 
the fire, add the crab meat, the 
egg yolks mashed fine, parsley, 
nutmeg, salt and cayenne. Clear 
the upper shells of the crabs, fill 
them with the mixture, brush 
over with beaten egg, cover with 
bread crumbs and put in a quick 
oven to brown; or better, put 
them in a frying basket and plunge 
into hot Cottolene until a nice 
brown. 



Meat* Poultry and Game 

Exact recipes are not so helpful in learning about meat cookery, as 
they are in flour preparations. It is the principle involved in the dif- 
ferent methods which one needs most to know; and this it seemed 
could be shown more clearly by grouping the meats, etc., by methods, 
rather than by giving separate recipes for every form of cooking each 
kind of meat. 

In purchasing beef, select that with a moderate amount of cream-col- 
ored fat ; avoid the dark, yellow fat ; it bespeaks an old animal. The 
lean should be lightly mottled with fat, and the flesh should be firm 
and of a good, dark red color. Never wash beef; scrape the outside, 
if necessary, or it may be wiped with a damp cloth, but never put in 
water, nor put directly on the ice, but put in the lower part of the re* 
frigerator or in a cool place. Never salt meat before it is cooked; 
wait until it is partly done. 

All meats should be cooked quickly at first to retain the juices. 
Boiled meat should be put in boiling water, baked meat in a very 
hot oven, and panned or broiled meat in a hot pan ; then they may 
be cooked more slowly after the outside is seared. 

Of the most desirable methods of cooking beef, perhaps broiling or 
grilling is best, as it preserves the juices and develops the flavor. 
Roasted beef, that done before the fire, is excellent. It is said boiled 
meat is more easily digested than either baked or roasted meats, on 
account of the overheating of the fat in the oven. Baking, however, 



32 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



develops the greatest flavor. Tender meats are best broiled, roasted 
or baked; the tough or so-called inferior pieces are best braised, boiled 
or stewed. 

Do not buy cold storage potiltry if possible to get it freshly killed. 
Game is one of the most expensive meats and the average family can 
indulge in it only occ^ionally. A general rule for cooking meat; — 
dark meats like beef and mutton, and some dark meated game, like 
wild ducks and grouse, should be cooked rare, but lamb, veal, pork, 
chicken, partridge, and some birds are cooked well done. 



ROAST OF BEEF 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Select choice rib roast and remove 
small end of bone, to use as short 
ribs or for stock, leaving a stand- 
ing roast. Score the edges of 
meat with a sharp knife and place 
on rack in open pan. Sear the 
meat well tmder gas flame. Re- 
duce heat when meat is crisp, 
season well and finish cooking 
in upper oven, basting meat often 
with fat in the pan. Turn flame 
out ten minutes before roast is 
done and make a gravy with four 
tablespoons each of meat fat and 
flour and a pint of stock (or boil- 
ing water). Season well,, add 
Kitchen Beuquet to color and 
flavor, and strain before serving. 
Meat cooked in this fashion is 
more like the roast prepared over 
an open fire, and no such flavor or 
juiciness can be obtained by bak- 
ing in a wood or coal oven. 

GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
If the liquid in the pan is mostly 
fat, as in beef cooked without 
water, pour off all but two table- 
spoons of fat, stir in two table- 
spoons of dry flour and when well 
mixed and brown, add one pint 



of boiling water; add salt, and 
strain after cooking eight minutes 
or t:!l smooth. Scrape all glaze 
from pan into gravy .as it gives 
fine flavor. If the pan contains 
mostly water, as with roast pork 
or poultry, dip off some of the fat, 
which by tipping pan will be on 
top, and stir in flour-and- water 
batter, mixed smooth; let it boil 
ten minutes, season and strain 
before serving. If ^ you have let 
the water cook nearly out and it 
looks curdled, add more water and 
stir well as it boils.

Suitable for large lean pieces of 
beef from round or rump, for 
shoulder of veal or mutton whole 
or in portions, for fowl, liver 
or any meat that has tough fibre 
and needs slow, gentle, moist heat 
to soften it, and also the rich 
flavor given by intense heat. 
Wipe, trim, try out some of the 
fat in kettle (for veal, use half salt 
pork or the kidney suet), brown 
sliced onions in fat, dredge meat 
with flour, brown it all over in the

hours, or till very tender. Re- 
plenish with half cup of water 
when needed, season and thicken 
it for gravy. 

BAKED OR ROAST MEATS OR 
POULTRY 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Suitable for leg, loin, rib, or rump 
of beef, mutton, lamb or veal, 
and for poultry and game. 
Meat should have tender fibre, 
and if not, or if poultry be old, it 
is better to steam it a while first. 
Wipe, trim, rub with salt and 
flour. Sear the lean surface of 
meat in the hot baking pan over 
the fire to keep in juices. Put it 
skin side up in hot pan in hot 
oven, with fat trimmings beneath,, 
without water. Watch carefully 
and when flour is brown, reduce 
the heat to about same as for 
bread. Use rack for level pieces 
if preferred, and for poultry; the 
ribs answer for rack in loin pieces. 
Roast beef, if to be rare, needs 
no water. To meats needing 
long cooking, like pork, veaf and 
poultry, add it when the fat and 
^our have begun to brown. 
Baste every ten minutes, less 
often for meat with thick fat on 
top, or for poultry covered with 
its own fat or greased paper. Do 
not let fat or flour bum. Add 
water as needed. Cook a six 
pound loin or rib from one to one 
and one-half hours, a ten potmd 
rump two hours, a ten pound 
turkey three hours. A fillet of 
beef, and dark-meated game, 
shotdd be rare, and are cooked 
without water, basted with fat 



pork or bacon laid on top. Cook 
twenty minutes to half an hour 
in very hot oven. 

FRIED MEAT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Small chops, cutlets of veal, 
portions of tripe, may be covered 
with bread crumbs, egg and 
crumbs, and cooked in hot deep 
Cottolene, reducing heat after the 
first plunge, so they will not be 
too brown when done, or cook 
them in a little of their own fat 
in spider. 

BROILED STEAK 

(Miss Willis) 

Have your steak at least an inch 
and a half thick. Trim off the • 
fat, leaving only a rim around the 
edge. Have the wire broiler 
greased well with suet and very 
hot. Lay the steak on and place 
exposed to a blaze that will 
quickly sear the surf ace without 
burning the fat. Then turn and 
sear the other side in the same 
manner. When this is done, turn 
again and broil about five min- 
utes with slightly reduced heat. 
Then turn and broil five minutes 
on other side. Have a heated 
platter ready with libout a table- 
spoon of melted butter; lay the 
steak on this, season with salt 
and pepper, and potir a little 
melted butter over the surface 
Serve very hot. When properly 
broiled the interior of the steak 
is pink and juicy. 

STEWED MEAT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use bones and trimmings from 
roasts, or the tough parts of steaks 



34 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



and chops, the legs, neck and 
wings of poultry, or use any tough 
cheap portion of any kind of 
fresh meat, first browning some 
of the lean in the melted suet or 
fat of the meat with a sliced 
onion, to give the flavor of roast 
meat. Use onion and turnip cut 
small with all meats; celery or 
sweet pepper with poultry; par- 
snip with pork; parsley, rice and 
tomato with veal. 

Cover bones and tough parts 
with cold water to make a rich 
broth, bring to boiling point 
guickly, skim to improve appear- 
ance, then add the lean or tender 
and browned meat to keep those 
portions rich in juice; simmer till 
bones are dean. Remove some 
of the fat and bones, add the 
vegetables, and twenty minutes 
before serving add sliced pota- 
toes, first scalding them to pre- 
vent their bitter juice from giv- 
ing the broth an unpleasant 
flavor. Thicken the water, sea- 
son to taste, varying it for differ- 
ent meats. If desired, add ten 
minutes before serving, dumplings 
made with one pint flour, one-half 
level teaspoon salt, one rounded 
teaspoon baking powder, and 
moisten with milk to soft dough. 
Use no shortening if you wish 
them light ; eggs are unnecessary. 
Drop the dough from a teaspoon 
into the boiling stew, letting them 
rest on meat or potato; or toss 
dough about till slightly floured, 
and cut with small cutter; keep 
covered tightly and cook just ten 
minutes. 



BARBECUED HAM 

(Miss Wmis) * 

Have cold boiled ham sliced 
somewhat thicker than for a cold 
service. Spread both sides of 
each slice lightly with mixed or 
made mustard. Heat butter in 
the chafing dish, and put in 
slices of the ham ; turn frequently 
until nicely browned, then pour 
over the slices two tablespoons 
of rather sharp cider or vinegar; 
let boil up and serve with apple 
rings, cooked in S3rrup of sugar 
and water tmtil clear^ but not 
broken. 

HAM AND BACON 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Ham for broiUng should be cut 
very thin, and bacon should not 
be more than one-fourth inch 
thick; better one-eighth. Cook 
in broiler, ttiming often. Or lay 
broiler over a pan and cook in 
oven. Or, cook bacon in a hot 
pan over the fire, turning often 
and serve when crisp. Drain well. 
Fried ham is improved by slow 
cooking, first, in water in the 
spider for half an hour, then let 
water boil out and the ham cook 
till fat is browned. 

FRIED VEAL 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Use slices from rump, w loin, or 

ribs; remove bones, tendons and 

skin, cover them with cold water 

and stew for the gravy. Cook 

veal fat in spider till brown and 

crisp; pound and shape meat 

into pieces for serving, brown it in 

the fat, then cook more slowly 

till done — with no trace of pink

color, for the veal should never be 
rare. Remove meat and crisp 
fat, add dry flour, brown it and 
reduce with the boiling water 
from the bones. Season with salt, 
pepper, and lemon if you like, 
and serre as gravy. If lean meat 
from leg, or some tough part, 
has been used, put it in stewpan 
when browned, and pour gravy 
over it and let it simmer for half 
an hour. 

STUFFED LEG OF LAMB 

(Mrs. Annstrong) 

Prepare a dressing by moistening 
two cups of bread crumbs (from 
inside of the loaf) with one-half 
cup of melted butter. Season 
with salt, pepper and thyme, or 
sweet marjoram, with a little 
onion, if desired. Add a very 
little water and place in the meat, 
skewering the ends into shape. 
Have oven very hot and place 
meat in pan, adding no seasoning 
until the surface is seared over. 
Then reduce the gas flame, dredge 
meat lightly with flour and the 
seasonings and baste the meat 
every ten or fifteen minutes (un- 
less a covered roasting pan is 
used), and roast about an hour 
and a half, if weighing five pounds. 
Serve with a brown sauce made 
from four tablespoons of flour and 
the drippings in the pan, with a 
pint of stock made by cooking the 
bones in water very slowly until 

it is well flavored. 

< 

SAUSAGE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Cook roll sausage whole in pan in 
the oven, dredge with flour and 



baste often. Cook two pound 
roll two hours. Serve hot or cold. 
Sausage cakes or links, cook in 
pan in the oven. 

BEEF LOAF 

(Miss Wmis) 

Four pounds lean beef chopped 
fine; one-half pound uncooked 
ham also chopped fine, one-half 
cup stale bread crumbs, one tea- 
spoon salt, one teaspoon onion 
jui^e, one-half teaspoon pepper, 
one-half teaspoon allspice, one- 
half teaspoon cloves, grating of 
nutmeg and one tablespoon chop- 
ped parsley. Mix thoroughly and 
place in bread pan or mold and 
bake in a quick oven about one 
and one-half hours, keeping it 
covered, until nearly done. Add 
two beaten .eggs to the mixture 
to bind it together. 

BEEF PIE WITH POTATO 
CRUST 

(Miss Willis) 
Boil five large potatoes in salted 

water. When done slice a layer 
into a buttered baking dish, then 
put in a layer of cold roast or 
boiled beef or mutton, season 
with salt, pepper and celery salt, 
add a little stewed or raw tomato 
if you have any left over. Then 
add another layer of potatoes, 
meat, etc., until dish is full. 
Reserve enough potato to make 
a cupful when mashed. To these 
add one tablespoon Cottolene, 
and when cool, one well beaten 
egg and whip until light. Then 
work in enough flour — from one- 
half to one cup — mixed with 
one-half teaspoon salt and one

teaspoon baking powder to make 
a crust that will roll out into a thin 
sheet. Make a gravy from scraps 
of meat and bones and any left 
over gravy and pour into the dish. 
Cut slit in top of the crust for the 
escape of steam, and bake in a 
quick oven about thirty minutes. 
Add a little onion to pie if you 
wish. 

CALF'S LIVER WITH CREAM 

GRAVT 

(Ma. Lincoln) 

Slice the liver one-third inch 
thick, scald and strip off the skin 
on edges, or snip it several times 
to prevent slices from curling. 
Drain and cook till brown in hot 
Cottolene, being careful not to 
bum it. Put the liver in a stew- 
pan, and cook two sliced onions 
in more Cottolene till yellow; add 
to the liver, pour in cream to 
cover, and simmer ten minutes, 
closely covered. Add salt and 
pepper to taste. 

NEW ENGLAND BOILED 

DINNER 

(ICias Willis) 

Remove the bone from a compact 
cut of the round of corned beef 
weighing about eight pounds, and 
tie the meat as closely as possible; 
put it in a deep pot, cover it with 
cold water, add ;& teaspoon of salt 
and half a saltspoon of pepper; 
let it boil quickly, removing all 
scum; when no more scum rises, 
put with it the following vege- 
tables, peded and cut in slices 
two ifiches thick. Two carrots, 
four beets, four white turnips, and 



one yellow turnip, six small onions 
peeled so that they will remain 
tmbroken, and a large head of 
celery cut in two-inch lengths. 
Place the pot where its contents 
will simmer slowly for two hours. 
A glass of wine or any table sauce 
preferred, may be added before 
the dish is finished. To serve it, 
put the meat in the middle of a 
platter, arrange the vegetables 
around it, and pour a little of 
the gravy over it. More oi the 
gravy should be served in a small 
boat, with a dish of boiled pota- 
toes. The tmited flavor of the 
meat and vegetables characterizes 
the dish. The beets may be 
boiled separately, without break- 
ing the skin, if they are so pre- 
ferred. 

MEAT PIES 

(Miss Willis) 

For the crust 
One pint flour, four tablespoons 
Cottolene, one teaspoon salt, one 
tablespoon sugar, two teaspoons 
baking powder, one generous gill 
water. 

Mix and roll the same as for 
pie crust, except that this crust is 
to be rolled only twice instead of 
four times. 

For the rest of the pie 
Take three pints of any kind of 
cold cooked meat, one quart 
water or stock (the water in which 
the bones have been boiled), two 
tablespoons butter, one table- 
spoon- minced onion, one table- 
spoon minced carrot, three table- 
spoons flour, two teaspoons salt, 
and one-third teaspoon pepper.

Cook the butter, carrot and 
onion together for ten minutes, 
take the v^etables from the 
butter and put them in a stewpan 
with the meat. Into the butter 
remaining in the pan put one 
tablespoon of the flour, and stir 
until smooth and frothy. Grad- 
ually add the stock or water to 
this, stirring all the time. Cook 
for five minutes, then pour upon 
the meat, and set the stewpan on 
the fire. Mix the remaining two 
tablespoons of flour with half a 
gill of cold water and stir into the 
pan containing the meat and 
gravy. Add the salt and pepper, 
and cook for fifteen minutes; 
then proceed as for chicken pie. 

BOILED OR STEAMED TURKEY 
OR FOWL 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Clean; rub weH with pepper and 

lemon juice, and stuff with o3rsters 
or bread stuffing. It is better 
without the stuffing, as the oys- 
ters are usually overdone, and 
the same flavor may be obtained 
from an oyster sauce served with 
the turkey. Truss the legs and 
wings close to the body; pin the 
fowl in a cloth to keep it whiter 
and preserve the shape. Put 
into boiling salted water. Allow 
twenty minutes to the pound. 
Cook slowly till tender, but not 
long enough for it to fall apart. 
Turkeys are much nicer steamed 
than boiled. Serve with oyster, 
celery or lemon sauce. Gamii^ 
with a border of boiled rice or 
macaroni, and pour part of the 
sauce over the f ow^ 



Fowls are sometimes stuffed 
with boiled celery, out into pieces 
an inch long; or with macaroni 
which has been boiled and sea- 
soned with salt and pepper. 

GRAVT FOR ROAST POULTRY 

AND GAME 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Put the giblets, or neck, liver, 
gizzard and heart, on to boil in 
one quart of water and boil till 
tender, and the water reduced to 
one pint. Mash the liver, and if 
desired, chop the gizzard, heart 
and meat from the neck. Potis 
off the dear fat from the dripping- 
pan, and put the settlings into a 
saucepan, rinse out the pan with 
the water in which the giblets 
were boiled, and potir this water 
into the saucepan and put on to 
boil. Put three or four table- 
spoons of the fat into a small fry- 
ing pan, add enough dry flour to 
absorb all the fat, and when brown 
add the giblet liquid gradually, 
and stir till it thickens. Season 
with salt and pepper. If not 
smooth, strain it, pour half of it 
into the gravy boat, and add the 
chopped giblets to the remaining 
half, and serve separately, as all 
may not care for the giblet gravy.

meld, Ihe light and dark meat in 
alternate layers. Return the 
b0|ies t# the broth with the gristle 
but not the skin, and let simmer 
until broth is reduced to about a 
cupful. A few slices of carrot 
and onion, a stalk or root of celery 
and leaves ef parsley, bay or 
sweet majoram or savory may be 
ceoked in the broth, then strained 
out. Season with salt and pep- 
per, allowing for meat as well as 
broth; pour the broth over the 
nieat, let it stand a short time to 
settle down through the meat, 
then cover meat with a board 
bearing a weight and let stand in 
a cold place over night. If meat 
is cut in dice it makes a prettier 



mold. The mold may be lined 
with sliced, hard-boiled eggs, and 
olives, if you want a "company" 
dish. 

BROILED CHICKEN 

(Mrs. AnnstroDg) 

Prepare, young chickens for broil- 
ing and spread lightly with soft 
butter mixed with salt, pepper 
and a little lemon juice. Cook 
slowly for twenty minutes, bast- 
ing and turning once, then in- 
crease the heat and brown well. 
Place on hot platter, spread with 
soft butter, paprika and minced 
parsley and serve. If chicken 
be large it is well to do the last 
part of the cooking in the upper 
oven.

Frying — Immersing food in an ample quantity of fat so hot that the 
instant the food is in it the outer surface is crisped, its absorbent prop- 
erties destroyed, its juices and flavors all retained, and it is thoroughly 
cooked, while its outer surface is brown and dry, is what is truly meant 
by * 'frying, * * and the product of this mode of frying is something deli- 
cious to the epicure and wholesome for those who live plainly. 

For frying, therefore, you must have your Cottolene very hot be^ 
fore the fo&d is put in. Always test before you begin to cook your food. 
Neither must 3rou put too much food in at one time, or the Cottolene 
will cool and your fiying will be retarded and injured in quality. Put 
it on in a cold pan and allow it to heat gradually; it will not sputter 
nor smoke and reaches a cooking temperature quicker than lard. Drop 
into the Cottolene a piece of bread ; if it browns in half a minute it is 
ready for use. It is unequaled for frjring doughnuts, fritters, vege- 
tables, fish, oysters and croquettes; test by dropping in a piece of 
dough. If it rises at once the fat is hot enough. Follow the direc- 
tions about having it very hot, and your food will come out dry, crisp, 
brown and delicate — no grease, no odor and no dyi^epsia.

SCALLOPED MEAT, FISH, OY- 
STERS, ETC. 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Allow one cup of sauce, one cup 
cracker crumbs moistened in one- 
fourth cup Cottolene, for two cups 
of meat or fish or any of the mix- 
tures given below. Line the 
deep baking dish with one-fourth 
of the crumbs, add a layer of mix- 
ture, a layer of sauce, one-fourth 
of crumbs, another layer of each 
and cover with the remaining 
half of the crumbs. Bake till 
crumbs are brown. Oysters may 
be used alone, with their juice 
and the crumbs. Some of the 
favorite combinations are as fol- 
lows: 

Mutton: Oysters, macaroni, 
and white or tomato sauce. 

Chicken: Rice, oysters or cel- 
ery, and white sauce. 

Beef: Onions, diced potatoes 
and brown gravy or sauce. 

Veal : Stuffing, rice, turnip and 
tomato sauce. 

Ham: Mustard, hard eggs, 
white sauce. 

Fish: Onions, pickles, tomato 
sauce. 

Oysters: Celery, bacon and 
white sauce. ^ 

(See pages 41 to 43 for* sauces) 

In this, as in all warmed-over 
dishes of meat or fish, discard 
anything uneatable, and cut meat 
in half-inch bits; if very tough 
stew it first, for the oven cooking 
will not always make it tender. 

CORNED BEEF HASH 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

To one pint of chopped meat add 



a pint and a half of chopped 
cooked potatoes. Melt one-third 
cup of Cottolene in a frying pan 
and add two tablespoons of minced 
onion. Mix the hash thoroughly 
with the Cottolene and season 
well, adding just enough water 
to moisten well (about half a cup). 
Cover closely and cook slowly for 
half an hour, or until a brown 
crust has formed on the bottom. 
Loosen carefully from the pan 
and turn out like an omelet on a 
hot platter. Garnish with parsley. 

CROQUETTES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Chop fine any kind of cooked 
meat or fish. If short of material, 
add mashed potatoes, or rice, to 
beef, mutton or fish; and to 
chicken, fish, oysters, or veal, 
add soft bread crumbs, or rice. 
Moisten light meats with thick 
white sauce (see page 42), equal 
amount, and dark meats with 
tomato (see page 43), or brown 
sauce (see page 42), made quite 
thick. Season with salt and 
pepper and onion juice if liked. 
When very cold, shape the mix- 
ture into balls or cylinders; roll 
first in sifted bread crumbs, then 
beaten egg diluted with one table- 
spoon milk, then crumbs again. 
Fry one minute in deep Cottolene, 
hot enough to brown a bit of bread 
while you count forty. Use a 
basket, and cook only four at a 
time. Drain on paper, and be 
sure that the fat is hot for each 
frying. Serve plain, or with 
sauce like that in the mixture, 
only thinner.

into cold water for five minutes 
to blanch. Scald one cup milk 
in double boiler. Rub together 
two tablespoons Cottolene and 
four of flour and add to the milk 
and stir until it thickens. Add 
the yolk of one egg; stir a minute 
and then remove from the fire 
and add one tablespoon Parmesan 
cheese, salt and cayenne to taste. 
Mix and let, get perfectly cold. 
Then form into croquettes, cylin-

CmCSXN CROQUETTES 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Make ^a sauce with four table- 
spoons of butter, six of flour and 
one cup milk, season with salt,

shape into cutlets or croquettes, 
roll in bread crumbs, beaten eggs 
and cnunbs again and fry in hot 
fat, preferably Cottolene. Serve 
with Bechamel or mushroom sauce 
or French peas. 

Mushroom sauce is made by 
adding one tablespoon of lemon 
juice to one cup cream sauce and 
one-half cup cooked mushrooms 
cut in pieces, or brown sauce may 
be used instead of white. 

Bechamel sauce is made like 
white sauce, with clear stock and 
cream instead of milk, and is 
highly seasoned. One whole egg 
or two beaten yolks are added 
just before serving. 

RICE CROQUETTES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Season hot boiled rice, cooked 
very soft, with salt, pepper, butter 
and grated cheese; and to one 
pint of rice, add yolks two eggs 
well beaten. Mix well and shape 
when cool in balls or ovals. 
Crumb-egg-and-crumb, and fry 
as usual. 



Sauces for Meats, FisH 
and Veg^etables 

The juices that flow from rare cooked meats are the best sauce for 
them; but do not try to make them go farther by pouring hot water 
over the meat as it is carved. A steak cooked to a turn needs only 
salt; it may have butter if it has but little fat; lamb chops need only 
salt, but many like to add a little lemon juice, or minced parsley, or 
tomato sauce, to both moats, and also to many other broiled meats, 
like chicken, tripe, etc. Apple sauce should be served with pork, 
duck and goose; cranberry sauce seems to belong to turkey and roast

chicken. Oily fish broiled needs but little butter, but salt and lemon 
juice may be used generously. White fish, like halibut, cod, etc., 
needs rich white sauce flavored with egg, lemon and onion. 

There is a common philosophy in making sauces. Remember 
that two level tablespoons of butter or Cottolene mixed with two level 
tablespoons of flour will thicken each half pint of liquid. 

For a white sauce rub the fat and flour together and add a half 
pint of milk; stir until boiling. 

For a tomato sauce rub the fat and flour together and add a half 
pint of nicely seasoned strained tomatoes. 

For a brown sauce, use half a pint of stock. 

For English drawn butter, rub the fat and flour together and add a 
half pint of boiling water; stir until boiling, then add a seasoning of 
salt and pepper and stir in, at last, an extra tablespoon of butter. 

The seasonings, of course, will vary, but each sauce will require 
a saltspoon of pepper and half teaspoon of salt. By remembering 
the proportions one may make a dozen saucer in a very few minutes 
and have them all smooth and palatable. 



WHITE SAUCE 

For White Meats, and Soups, Fish, 

Vegetables, Egge, Toast, or

For Toast 

Nothing more is needed, but dip 
toast in hot milk if liked soft. 

For Meat and Fish 
Add lemon juice, cayenne, capers, 
bits of oysters, lobsters, or cooked 
celery, and a few drops of onion 
juice; or cook one rounded tea- 
spoon minced onion, or celery, or

FOR PUDDING SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincc^) 
Make white sauce (see page 41) 
using one and one-half cups of 
hot water, add when smooth one. 
and one-half cups of brown, or

BROWN SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

We call this brown gravy when 
made in the roasting pan from 
the fat or dripping of meat with 
simple seasoning of salt and pep- 
per; and brown sauce when we 
make it in a frying pan with 
butter and brown stock, and sea- 
son highly. But the principle 
is the same, and the way to avoid 
the pale, greasy, or curdled mix- 
ture so often served, is to use the 
right proportions of flour and fat 
and cook them till well browned 
before adding the liquid. You 
cannot brown flour and water, 
until most of the water is boiled 
out, but you can brown flour and 
fat very quickly; and flour will 
only absorb about its bulk of fat. 
For gravy, make it as directed 
under Roast Meat. 



For special dishes, when the 
baking pan has not furnished the 
starting point of glaze and 
browned fat, melt in an iron pan 
one rounded tablespoon of butter, 
or Cottolene, or any fat of meat 
you are preparing ; let it brown, 
add one rounded tablespoon flour 
or cornstarch, stir till very brown 
(it will be lighter when wet),, 
add gradually one cup of hot 
stock (that made from stewing 
trimmings of meat you are cook- 
ing will answer, instead of using 
nice cleared stock prepared for 
soup). Add more hot water if 
too thick, boil down if too thin; 
season with salt, pepper and lemon 
juice, and add mushrooms, catsup, 
horseradish, currant jelly, or any 
other condiment which will blend 
with the meat. The main points 
are to have it brown, smooth, 
free from grease, and savory. 

HORSERADISH SAUCE 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Put a half pint of milk or cream 
in a double boiler. Rub together 
a tablespoon of Cottolene and an 
even tablespoon of flour; then 
stir them into the boiling milk, 
add one ounce of young horse- 
radish, finely grated, a half tea- 
spoon of salt and a half teaspoon 
of sugar. This is exceedingly 
nice to serve with boiled, fresh 01 
salt meat. 

PARSLEY BUTTER 

(Miss Wiffis) 
Beat three tablespoons butter 01 
two of Cottolene to a cream, then 
add one tablespoon lemon juice, 
one tablespoon minced parsley,

one-half teaspoon salt. Beat all 
the ingredients into the butter 
and it is ready to use. If in- 
tended for potato balls, use less 
lemon juice. 

TOMATO SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

For Chops, Fish, Macaroni, etc. 

Cook one rounded tablespoon 
minced onion in one tablespoon 
Cottolene till only slightly col- 
ored; add, if liked, the same 
amount of minced sweet pepper, 
celery or parsley, carrot or turnip ; 
stir in one rounded tablespoon 



flour, and one-fourth level tea- 
spoon salt; add gradually from 
one to one and one-half cups 
strained hot tomato, or any left- 
over stewed tomato if unsweet- 
ened. Strain before serving, if 
desired smooth. This is espec- 
ially suitable for veal chops, flsh^ 
macaroni and many dishes of 
left-overs.

Vegjetables 



Meats carefully cooked are, no doubt, more easily digested than some 
vegetables, but, on the other hand, vegetables are clean and wholesome. 
Vegetable foods are concentrated and slow of digestion; hence, the 
vegetarian eats but two meals a day, and on these two meals, if his 
diet is well selected, he receives more nourishment than the meat 
eater from his three meals a day. In selecting a vegetarian diet, choose 
nitrogenous vegetables to take the place of meat; with a meat diet 
select green and starchy vegetables to fill in the vacancies of a nitrog- 
enous diet. With beef we serve potatoes. With poultry, rice, or (in 
chestnut season) boiled chestnuts or macaroni, or hominy or white 
bread. 

All green vegetables are put on to cook in boiling water. Add 
salt to the water in which green or top ground vegetables are cooked ; 
white or underground vegetables are better when the salt is added 
after the cooking. Wash rice through one or two waters before boiling. 

Soak dried fruits over night. 

Cabbage, cauliflower, onions and turnips, vegetables containing 
volatile oil, must be boiled rapidly in an uncovered vessel, or they will 
emit unpleasant odors. 

Medium sized onions should be boiled in salt water one hour. 

Green com in salted water five minutes. 

Peas in salted water twenty minutes. 

Asparagus in salted water thirty minutes.

STRING BEANS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use fresh, tender, yellow or green 
beans. Remove strings and ends, 
cut in slanting slivers; to one pint 
of beans, put into a stew-pan one 
level tablespoon butter, one-half 
level teaspoon salt, a dash of nut- 
meg, and pepper; add beans, 
lifting them from the pan with 
only the water that clings to 
them; cover tightly, and cook 
very, very slowly, about one hour, 
or till tender. Their own juice, 
with just heat enough to turn it 
into steam, will cook them; but, 
if cooked too fast, and they begin 
to sizzle, add one or two table- 
spoons of water. Turn out when 
tender with no further seasoning. 

GREEN OR SHELLED BEANS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Shel^, wash, cook in boiling water 
five minutes, pour off, adding 
first, to the strong varieties that 
turn dark in cooking, one-fourth 
teaspoon soda; rinse, add more 
boiling water, and cook until 
soft, adding water as needed to 
have enough left to moisten well. 
Mash a few and season with salt, 
a bit of sugar, pepper and one 
tablespoon butter, and stir this 
into the water, boil for a moment 
and serve. 

No. 2. Add to the cooked 
beans an equal amotint of raw or 
boiled sweet corn scraped from 



cob, season in proportion, cook

tash. 

Dried Lima or other Beans; 
Soak twelve hours in cold water; 
slip off the skin if it comes off 
easily, then cook the same as 
fresh beans till tender, and season. 

BAKED BEANS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

The noon before, pick over and 
soak one quart of pea beans 
(small white) in cold water. Next 
morning add fresh water and let 
them simmer (not boil) till 
slightly soft but not broken. 
Skim them out into an earthen 
pot having bulging sides, a 
narrow top and a cover. Cut one 
onion in quarters, and put por- 
tions of it in with the beans. 
Cut rind of one poimd of fat salt 
pork (with a streak of lean) 
down for one inch — and, a half 
inch apart, imbed it with the 
beans, leaving the rind up. Mix 
one level teaspoon each of 
mustard, salt and brown sugar, 
and two tablespoons of molasses, 
fill the cup with boiling water, 
pour it over the beans, add 
enough more to fill the pot. 
Bake slowly six to eight or ten 
hours. As water boils out add 
more, then when out again, let 
the beans cook until you hear 
them sizzle; this will indicate 
that water is low, and the fat is 
beginning to cook on the edge of 
the pot. Let it do so for a while, 
for this gives a rich color and 
flavor, better than that obtained 
by an excess of molasses, and

hardens the beans slightly, so 
they will not be mushy, although 
soft. Then lift the pork up on 
top and add water just to show 
above the beans, and keep it so 
during the remainder of the 
baking. 

These specific directions are 
for the benefit of persons outside 
of New England, who seldonT 
find or prepare beans as they are 
served in that land where they 
have aQ honored place on many 
tables. If you do not care to use 
pork, use Cottolene — one-half 
cup, or fat corned beef. 

When warming them over, 
melt some of the pork in a small 
pan, add the beans and let them 
cook, without stirring, till warm 
or slightly browned; or brown 
them in Cottolene. These are 
more palatable than when 
warmed in water, tmless you wish 
to make bean puree or soup. 
This we learn from the Mexican 
way of cooking beans. 

GREENS, SPINACH, ETC. 

(Bin. Lincoln) 
Pick over, trim, wash in five 
waters, drain, put into kettle 
with water that drips from them; 
cook slowly at first till juice is 
drawn out; then quickly till 
tender; drain, rinse if you dislike 
the strong flavor, chop, reheat, 
season with butter, salt and pep- 
per; add cream if you like, or 
serve with lemon or vinegar. If 
for a course, garnish with hard 
boiled eggs; or serve cold as a 
salad. 



RED CABBAGE, ONIONS, SUM- 
MER CARROTS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Cut either of these vegetables into 
slivers and cook the same as string 
beans using a bit of onion in 
place of nutmeg with the red 
cabbage, and adding one teaspoon 
vinegar just before serving. To 
the carrots, add one-half teaspoon 
sugar, and one teaspoon lemon 
juice; and to the onion, add a 
little milk or cream. 

BEETS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Wash with care not to break skin 
and make them bleed. Cook in 
boiling water till tender, about 
one hour. Plunge into cold water 
and rub off skins. Chop coarsely, 
heat again, season with butter, 
salt and pepper; or slice thin and 
cover with vinegar. Butter will 
not blend easily with beets unless 
they are chopped. Winter beets 
require three hours' cooking. 

PARSNIPS

Scrub, scrape or pare,^ divide 

lengthwise in quarters, cut off 
from the sharp edge all the woody 
fibre which runs through the 
center; slice in half -inch bits, and

about fifteen minutes or till soft. 
Drain, mash with a four-pronged 
fork to break up all the fibre; 
add salt, pepper and butter and 
serve plain ; or shape in flat cakes,' 
flour slightly, and brown in a 
Httle hot Cottolene. By remov- 
ing the pithy center the parsnips

boil for twenty or thirty minutes. 
Be careful to take it out as soon 
as tender, or it will fall into pieces. 
Drain and separate the head into

Wash, trim off tough ends, tie 
in btmdle, cook in boiling slightly 
salted water, twenty minutes or 
till tender. Moisten toast with 
the water, spread with butter, 
lay a few stalks on each slice, add 
butter and salt and serve hot as a 
course; or as the main part of a 
meal when you do not wish meat. 

No. 2. Cook only about three 
inches of the tip and serve cold 
as a salad. Cut the remainder 
into inch bits, boil, mash, sift and 
use for cream soup. 

Olery (the outer stalks divided 
once), cuctimbers (pared and 
quartered lengthwise), leeks (free 
from tips and rootlets) may each 
be cooked, seasoned and served in 
the same way as asparagus. 



Soup 



For the family in moderate circumstances, or the woman who does all 
the work of the house, it is unwise to have soup every day, for it makes 
unnecessary labor in changing for so many courses, and compels some 
one to look out that the next course is served hot. Better utilize the 
usual soup material in a stew, or some kind of made-over dish, which 
may serve as the chief dish of the meal. When dinner is served at 
noon, broths and soups may be served at the supper, giving the warmth 
and stimulation often desired but too often supplied by a second or

especially for children who do not usually take the liquid food needed 
then, which others have in coffee, etc. 



VEGETABLE CREAM SOUPS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Prepare the vegetable; cook po- 
tatoes, cauliflower or artichokes 
in boiling water and discard water ; 
cook others in cold water, let it 
cook nearly all out; mash, press 
through sieve, add white sauce 
(one cup to each pint of pulp and 
water for most fresh green vege- 
tables, also for canned vegetables; 
and one pint of sauce for each 
pint of pulp from spinach, toma- 
toes and other succulent vege- 
tables). Season with salt and 
pepper; dilute with hot milk if 
too thick; add beaten egg, or 
more pulp if too thin. Serve 
with toasted crackers. 

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP 

(MissWmis) 
One quart chicken or veal broth, 
one quart milk, one-half cup rice, 
one teaspoon salt, one head 
celery, seasoning. 

Use for this soup a quart of 
chicken or veal broth and about 
a quart of milk; pick over and 
wash the rice, rinse it well in cold 
water, and put it in a thick sauce- 
pan over the fire, with a pint of 
milk and a teaspoon of salt; 
wash a head of celery and grate 
the white stalks, letting the grated 
celery fall into milk enough to 
cover it, put the grated celery 
with the rice, and gently simmer 
them together until the rice is 
tender enough to rub through a 



sieve with a potato masher, add- 
ing more milk if the rice absorbs 
what has first been put with it. 
After the rice has been rubbed 
through the sieve, return it to the 
saucepan, place i( again over the 
fire, and gradually stir with it the 
quart of stock or broth; if this 
quantity of stock does not dilute 
the soup to a creamy consistency, 
add a little milk; let the soup get 
scalding hot, season it palatably 
with salt, white pepper, and a 
very little grated nutmeg, and 
serve at once. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP .

One quart milk, one pint canned 
tomatoes, or one pint stewed 
tomatoes, three teaspoons Cotto-

blade of mace, one teaspoon sugar, 
one-quarter teaspoon baking soda, 
two tablespoons flour. 

Put the tomatoes on to stew

chicken, veal, or fish have been 
boiled, or of pulp of vegetables, 
allow one cup of thick white 
sauce made with cream. Com- 
bine, season, and serve plain, or 
with sifted egg yolk, minced

one egg white. 

Cut into dice four pounds of 
lean beef from the round; put 
about one ounce of suet and one 
small onion — sliced, into the soup 
kettle and cook until a good 
brown; then add the meat, 
cook without covering thirty

end of this time add the cloves, 
carrots, a piece of celery, and 
simmer one hour longer. Strain 
and stand away to cool. When 
cold, remove all grease from the 
surface. Turn the consommd in- 
to a kettle; beat the white of an 



egg with a half cup of cold water,

NOODLE SOUP 

(Miss WiUis) 
One large egg, generous one-half 

cup flour, two quarts boiling 

water, three pints milk, three 

tablespoons flour, onion, mace, 

salt and pepper. 

To m£ike the noodles, break the 
egg into a bowl and beat into it a 
little more than half a cup of 
flour and one-fourth of a teaspoon 
of salt. Now work this dough 
with the hands until it becomes 
smooth and like putty. Sprinkle 
a molding-board with flour, and 
roll the dough as thin as possible. 
It should be like a wafer. Let it 
lie upon the board for five min- 
utes, then roll it up loosely, and 
with a sharp knife cut into slices 
about one-third of an inch thick. 
Spread these little pieces on the 
board, and let them dry for half 
an hour or more. Put on the 
stove a large saucepan contain- 
ing two quarts of boiling water. 
Add a tablespoon of salt, and, 
after turning the noodles into the 
water, cook them rapidly for 
twenty-five minutes. Turn into 
a colander and drain. 

To make the soup, use three 
pints of milk, three tablespoons 
of flour, one slice of onion, a bit 
of mace, two teaspoons of salt, 
and one-third of a teaspoon of 
pepper.

POTATO CHOWDER 

(Miss Willis) 
"Peel and cut in dice five good 
sized potatoes. Throw into cold 
water. Cut quarter of a pound 
of ham in shreds and chop a 
medium sized onion coarsely. 
Pry ham and onion together until 



nicely browned. Mince a table- 
spoon of parsley. Drain water 
from the potatoes and put in a 
layer of potato dice in the bottom 
of a stewing kettle, then a sprinkle 
of the ham, onion and parsley. 
Then more potato dice, and so on 
until all is used. Cover with cold 

a 

water and let come slowly to boil- 
ing point. Cook until the pota- 
toes are tender but not done 
enough to lose their shape. Add 
a pint of good, rich milk and sea- 
son to taste with sAlt and pepper. 
Rub to a smooth paste two level 
tablespoons of butter and two

boils up, stir in the thickening 
and continue to stir gently until 
it boils again, then serve at once. 



Salads, Sandi^iclies and 

RelisHes 

Serve a portion of fresh green vegetable, or ripe fruit, with every 
dinner if possible and dress it simply, always in this order (for if lettuce 
is wet first with the acid, the oil will not adhere) ; with salt to make it 
savory; pepper or other spice to make it bright; oil, cream or butter, 
to make it smooth and more nutritious, by supplying the fatty element 
lacking in the vegetable; and lemon juice or vinegar to give piquancy 
to the combination. Many like to add a bit of sugar to lessen the 
acidity. 

Fruit salads may precede a dinner or luncheon in warm weather, 
or follow as a dessert at any time; or be served with supper. When 
they are served first, they are dressed with sugar. 



SALAD VEGETABLES 

(BIrs. Lincoln) 
Celery, cucumbers, lettuce, rad-

will be cold ; they will keep crisp 
for several days. Do not scrape 
celery till ready for the table. 
Pare cucumbers and let them 
stand in ice-water half an hour. 
Or, pare, but slice just before 
serving. Put the whole pared 
cuctmiber on a shallow dish, 
cut in very thin and even slices, 
but keep them together as if 
whole, and pour French dressing 
over them. Or let each person 
dress them to his own liking. 

Arrange lettuce in a deep bowl, 
large dark leaves outside, and so 
on, with the light colored and 
small ones in center, as if half 
opened. Celery looks best in an 
upright glass with its delicate 
tips opening out like a flower. 
The poorer stalks may be cut in 
three inch lengths. With radishes, 
cut skin i^n petal-like divisions. 

TOMATO SALAD 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Scald and peel large ripe toma- 
toes, cut in halves or slices and 
serve very cold; to be dressed to 
taste. Or scoop out the centers, 
making cups to be filled with the 
scooped-out portion, mixed with 
dice of cucumber, celery, or sweet 
pepper, nuts or cheese, and dressed ; 
or, cut the firm pvdp, from the 
bett»m part way down to the 
stem, in petal-shaped strips, turn 
them partly back like an opened 
tulip and serve in a lettuce cup. 
Use any dressing you prefer, from 
your own estimate of sugar, salt, 
pepper and lemon, on through 
the French, the boiled and the 
sour cream dressings to the rich

and blend perfectly with the

are not at hand, use the canned. 

POTATO SALM> 

(Miss Willis) 
Scrub small new potatoes, or 
smallest of old ones of the waxy 
variety, poil them tender but 
not long enough to break easily. 
Peel while hot and cut in dice and 
mix with an equal amount of 
cucumber dice. Dress with little 
oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and 
onion juice and let stand fifteen 
minutes. Then mix with a boiled

CABBAGE SALAD 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

This is one of the daintiest of 
winter salads: 

Shave the cabbage on a slaixp* 
cutter in a pan of very cold water; 
let it soak for one hour, th^i press 
it dry, put it in a tow^ and wring 
dry. Heap in the salad bowl ; at 
serving time at the table dust it 
first with a teaspoon of salt, then 
a little pepper; sprinkle over a 
little mint sauce and six table-

Spoons o{ olive oil. With a fork 
and spoon toss thoroughly until 
every part of tne cabbage is 
covered with seasoning and oil. 
Put over two tablespoons of tarra- 
gon vinegar, mix thoroughly and 
serve. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Allow about equal parts of cold 
boiled chicken or fowl, cut in 
small cubes, and celery cut in 
thin slices. Blend with a little 
mayonnaise dressing, make it 
into a mound on a platter, cover 
with mayonnaise, or the boiled 
cream dressing if you do not like 
oil; garnish with the celery tips, 
a few capers, or minced parsley, 
or with a border of alternate slices 
of tomato and cucumber. Do 
not use tomato and beet together 
in any salad. 

HATONNAISS 

(Miss Willis) 
If you have no * * mixer " you can 

make a perfect dressing in the 
following manner: 

Beat two raw egg yolks ; add one- 
half teaspoon salt and scant one- 
half teaspoon paprika and beat 
again; add four tablespoons acid, 
a little at a time, and*beat thor- 
oughly. The add may be lemon 
juice or vinegar, or both in equal 
proportions. Add one teaspoon 
olive oil, put in an egg beater and 
beat oil in thoroughly; add oil, 
about one teaspoon at a time 
for several times, then in larger 
quantities, beating vigorously. 
Add one' pint of oil to the two 
eggs. Vigorous and long beat- 



ing is absolutely necessary in 
order to avoid the danger of 
mayonnaise separating or ' *curdl- 
mg. 

To improve mayonnaise: To 
one-half cup mayonnaise salad 
dressing add one heaping teaspoon 
peanut butter, thoroughly mixed 
in a small quantity at a time. It 
gives a richer flavor. 

DRESSING FOR COLD SLAW 
(RED CABBAGE) 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix one rounded tablespoon sugar, 
one-half level teaspoon each salt 
and mustard, one-fourth level 
teaspooti pepper and one level 
teaspoon flour. Melt one level 
tablespoon Cottolene in saucepan, 
stir in the dry mixture and add 
gradually one-half cup hot vine- 
gar. When thick and smooth, 
add quickly one beaten egg; cook 
a moment longer and pour it hot 
into one pint shaved red cabbage 
and serve at once, hot or cold. 

Use this dressing also for any 
mixed salad of cold vegetables. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix at the table in a small cup or 
bowl with a lip, one-fourth level 
teaspoon salt, a few shakes of 
paprika, or white pepper, three 
tablespoons of oHve oil, or choice 
cottonseed oil, and one tablespoon 
of lemon juice or vinegar. Stir 
till the vinegar blends with the 
oil, and potir it over the salad. 
If mustard is desired, add it with 
the salt. Add also a few drops 
of onion juice. Use this to season 
or marinade fish and meat salads

before adding the richer dress- 
ings, and also on most of the sim-

or other dry cheese with a plain 
lettuce salad, as there may be 
some who would not eat the 
lettuce with cheese. 

DATE SANDWICH 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Wash dates in tepid water, dry 

and stone them, remove scales 
and the inner skin near stone,

PURE FOOD RECIPES 




Cheese is one of the most nutritious and econonjical foods for those 
persons who can digest it easily. Cooking or melting and combining 
it with other foods that its close texture may be broken up, and add- 
ing a bit of soda to replace the potash salts taken from the milk in 
making it into cheese, will usually make cheese more digestible and 
valuable as a food. Do not over-cook it, or harden it by dry cooking. 
Being more nitrogenous than other foods and having a distinctive 
flavor, it should be served with starchy foods and those lacking in 
flavor, like potato, macaroni, rice, bread, etc. It is generally served at 
the end of a dinner as an aid to digestion, sometimes with only a wafer; 
sometimes, by those who like the combination, with pie, and our 
English cousins make their last course at dinner one of cheese with 
celery. 



WELSH RAREBIT 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Two cups grated cheese, two eggs, 
one-half cup of milk, salt and 
cayenne to taste. 

Toast carefully slices of bread 
with the crusts removed. While 
hot, butter them, and then 
plunge in a bowl of hot water. 
Place on a heated dish and stand 
in oven to keep warm while you 
make the rarebit. Put the milk 
in a porcelain-lined or granite 
saucepan; stand it over a mod- 
erate fire; when boiling hot, add 
the cheese; stir continually until 
the cheese is melted; add salt, 
cayenne and yolks, and pour it 
over the toasted bread. If the 
rarebit is stringy and tough, it is 
the fault of the cheese not being 
rich enough to melt. 

Old English dairy cheese makes 
the best Welsh rarebit. Stale 
beer may be used in place of milk. 



BAKED POTATOES WITH 
CHEESE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Divide a hot baked potato in 
halves the long way, lay in a slice 
of cheese same size and one-third 
inch thick, put together, press 
slightly and cover with napkin 
and by the time it is served, cheese 
will have softened, and make a 
savory addition to the potato. 

MACARONI OR SPAGHETTI 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Break into half -inch bits, cook in 
boiling salted water till tender; 
drain, reheat in stock, or strained 
tomato, or milk, season with salt, 
pepper and butter or cream, and 
when serving cover with grated 
cheese; or after boiling, moisten 
with white sauce (see page 41), 
or tomato sauce (see page 43), 
add cheese in layers and cover 
with buttered crumbs and bake 
twenty minutes.

CHEESE FONDU 

(Marion Harland) 
Two cups milk, with a pinch of 
soda stirred in ; one cup very dry, 
fine crumbs, one-half pound of 
dry cheese; four beaten eggs, 
one level- tablespoon of melted 
Cottolene, pepper, salt, and a 
pinch of mace. 

Soak the crumbs iif the milk; 
beat in the eggs, Cottolene, sea- 
soning, lastly the cheese. Butter 
a pudding dish; put in the mix- 
ture, strew the top with fine 
crumbs, and bake covered, half 
an hour; then brown quickly. 
Eat soon, as it will fall in cool- 
ing. 



CHEESE SOUFFL^ 

(Mis. Rorer) 
One and a half tablespoons Cot- 
tolenei one tablespoon fiour, one- 
half cup milk, one-half teaspoon 
salt, three eggs, one cup grated 
cheese, cayenne. 

Stir the flour in the Cottolene 
while heating in a saucepan. 
Pour in the milk slowly and let it 
come to a boil; add the season- 
ing, the yolks of eggs well beaten, 
and the grated cheese. Pour into 
a bowl and let cool. When cool, 
stir in the whites of eggs beaten 
stiff. Pour into small pans, or one 
shallow pan, and bake in a moder- 
ate oven about twenty minutes. 



Pies and Pastry 

Pies have been greatly abused, but it is their abuse rather than their 
use which should be condemned. When properly made with Cotto- 
lene and eaten at suitable times and in moderation, they are no more 
indigestible for a normal person than are many other foods which so 
far have escaped this \mjust criticism. 

Cottolene is well adapted for pastry; for it makes a light and deli- 
cate crust, and is much more wholesome than either butter or lard. 

As Cottolene contains no salt, always add salt in pastry making. 
This is a universal rule and must not be forgotten. 

Where Cottolene is used in place of lard or butter in recipes not 
in this book, be sure and use one-thdrd less than where lard or butter 
is called for. 

The best results are obtained when all the ingredients in the mix- 
ing of the pastry are exceedingly cold. 



PASTRY FOR ONE PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix one scant half level teaspoon 
salt with one and one-half cup 
pastry flour. Chop in with a 
knife a scant one-half cup of 
chilled Cottotene. When it is well 



cut together, mix in very grad- 
ually three tablespoons cold water, 
chopping the n:il!xture and try- 
ing to avoid wet streaks. Do not 
knead with the hands. If soft 
lay the paste in a pan on ice until 
chilled. Sprinkle some flour on

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



the molding-board; flour the 
rolling pin; roll into rectangular 
shape, gather together like a jelly 
roll, divide in two pieces, stand 
piece on end, pat it fiat, then roll 
in circular shape till a little larger 
than the plate. When rolled to 
the required size cover the sides 
and bottom of the pie dish. Fill 
with the pie material. Roll the 
other part of the paste in the same 
way, making it one-half inch 
larger than the plate to allow for 
the filling and puffing in baking. 
Make several incisions in the top 
crust before you lay it on, that 
there may be an outlet for the 
steam, especially for meat pies. 
Put it on loosely, throwing the 
fullness back into the center with 
the edges just even and press 
them slightly together, first wet- 
ting the lower edge if it is for a 
juicy pie. Press the two crusts 
back slightly from the edge of 
the plate and mark, or not, as you 
please, with a fork or crimper. 

Marking keeps the crust from 
puffing, and it also helps to retain 
the juice. Binding the crust to 
the plate with an inch strip of 
wet cloth is about the surest way 
to keep in the juice. 

CHOPPED PASTE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix one level teaspoon of baking 
powder and one scant half level 
teaspoon salt with one heaped 
cup of sifted pastry flour. Chop 
in one heaped tablespoon of chilled 
Cottolene and mix to a stiff dough 
with cold water. Toss out on 
floured board, pat into rectangu- 



lar shape, and if to use at once 
divide in halves and roll to fit the 
plate. If the paste is soft, or 
you are not ready to make the 
pies, keep it in ice-chest wrapped 
in wet cloth between two pans. 
A larger amount of paste may be 
made, if many pies are to be pre- 
pared, and kept on hand in this 
way; but pies are better if filled 
and baked when needed. 

APPLE PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Line a tin pie plate with paste ; 
cut five or six greening apples in 
quarters, remove skin and core 
and lay the quarters round the 
edge of the plate uniformly. 
If apples are very large, cut each 
quarter in half, but usually one 
thick piece of apple will soften in 
baking as quickly as several thin 
pieces piled one on another. 
Heap the dish with the broken 
pieces in center. Sprinkle two 
tablespoons of water over the 
fruit, but do not sweeten imtil 
baked. Lay the upper crust on 
lightly without pressing the edges. 
Bake till apples are soft. When 
the crust is brown raise it a little 
and if the apples are tender 
remove the pie from the even. 
Slip a knife around between the 
crusts and lay the top aside. 
Melt and boi?. slightly one-half 
cup of sugar, or more if apples are 
very tart, in two tablespoons of 
water, add one teaspoon of butter, 
or a few grains of salt, and any 
spice desired (cinnamon, nutmeg 
or allspice — but lemon juice with a 
a little of the grated rind is best

of all). Pour this syrup over the 
apple, being sure that every part 
has its share, replace the cover, 
press the edges together, and you 
have a pie in which you will 
surely have saved all the juice 
and flavor of the fruit. 

CHERRY OR BERRY PIES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Line a deep earthen or granite 

pie plate with paste, put a half- 
inch strip round the edge, first 
wetting the lower paste. Sprinkle 
over the paste one-half cup of 
sugar mixed with one rounded 
tablespoon of flour and dot it 
with one teaspoon of butter. Fill 
the plate with cherries or fruit, 
which have been washed, drained, 
stoned, and rolled in sugar. Cut 
through the upper crust in two or 
three places, lay it over the fruit 
and press the edges close to the 
rim. Bake about half an hour 
and serve while warm. 

CREAM PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Line a shallow plate with a crust, 

prick several holes in it to pre- 
vent rising unevenly, put on a 
border half an inch wide using 
fluted jagger for cutting; bake 
quickly and set away to cool. 
Mix one level tablespoon of corn- 
starch and two rounded table- 
spoons of sugar and stir them into 
the beaten yolk of one egg, add 
, one-fourth level teaspoon salt, the 
beaten white and two cups of hot 
milk. Strain into double boiler 
and cook twenty minutes stirring 
frequently. Flavor with vanilla 
and pour into the baked crust. 



Serve cold without any cover; 
or, if you like, spread a thin layer 
of apple jelly over the top, cover 
with a meringue of two egg whites 
and one-half cup powdered sugar 
beaten stiff and slightly browned. 

CUSTARD PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use a plate about an inch and a 
half deep, with not too flaring 
edge. Roll out crust an inch 
larger than the plate, turn the 
edge under, first being sure that 
no bubbles of air are left between 
crust and plate, and pinch the 
crust into a fluted rim. Heat 
three cups milk, beat yolks of 
three eggs with one-half cup sugar 
till light, add one-half teaspoon 
salt and a little grated nutmeg, if 
you like it ; add the hot milk and 
the whites of eggs beaten only 
till foamy. Beating the whites 
separately may seem unneces- 
sary, but it gives a more uniform- 
ly browned crust, of fine grain 
like that of nice cake, instead of 
the blistered patches of brown 
over a yellow uneven surface 
which is often seen. Brush the 
under crust with a little white of 
egg left in bowl, dredge lightly 
with flour and then strain the 
custard into the dish, adding the 
last portion after setting the dish 
in the oven, if it seems to be too 
full. Bake slowly till it pufls up 
all over and a knife inserted in 
the center will come out clean and 
not milky.

or slightly less of cornstarch, with 
three-fourths cup sugar, and scant 
one-fourth teaspoon salt, add the 
well beaten yolks of three eggs, 
and white of one, the grated rind 
of half and juice of one large 
lemon, and one cup water. Bake 
it in plate lined with rich crust 
in a moderate oven. Beat whites 
of two eggs with one-half cup 
powdered sugar till very stiff, 
pile it roughly on the pie and color 
it slightly in moderate oven. 

HINCB Pm MEAT 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

The proportions for one cup of 
meat are given, and the recipe 
may be doubled or quadrupled 
as desired. One- c)ip each of 
chopped boiled meat, seeded 
raisins, brown sugar, meat liquor, 
and boiled cider; three cups 
chopped apples; one-fourth cup 
each of chopped citron and molas- 
ses, and any stewed dried fruit 
(peach, apricot, or prune); one 
tablespoon each of salt and cuma- 
mon, one-half teaspoon each of 
mace and nutmeg and allspice if 
3rou like, the juice of one orange 
and one lemon with grated rind of 
half, or one strip of candied peel, 
a few grains of pepper, and when 
the pies are ready to bake sprinkle 
each with one-half teaspoon rose 
water. Use beef from the neck 
or round — juicy, lean, with a 
lij;tle fat; cook in the liquor and 
use this for moisture. If boiled 
cider is not at hand, use syrup 
from sweet pickle; or, use more 
lemon and orange juice. Mix 
thoroughly and cook till apples 



are dear. Seal in jars for keep- 
ing. Wine and brandy may be 
used if considered necessary, but 
it is good enough without. 

PUMPKIN PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use the small, deep-colored pump- 
kins, cut in quarters, remove seeds 
and bake it skin side down till 
tender; scoop out pulp and sift 
it. For one pie allow, if baked in 
a deep plate, two cups of pump- 
kin, two cups scalded nulk, one 
beaten egg,jor one common crack- 
er rolled fine, one-half level tea- 
spoon ginger, one-fourth cup 
sugar, one-fourth cup molasses, 
one level teaspoon salt, and if you 
like grandmother's way, add two 
tablespoons of boiled and seeded 
raisins. Always boil raisins first, 
for the baking in the pie will not 
cook them enough. Mix in the 
order given and bake in a deep 
plate lined and bordered with a 
plain or fluted rim. It is done 
when it puffs in center and shrinks 
away from the edge. 

RAISIN PIE 

(MissWiUis) 
Grate the yellow from one lemon, 
discard all the white part of rind 
and seeds. Chop remainder of 
lemon and a cup of stoned raisins 
together, add a pinch of salt, a 
piece of butter the size of walnut, 
half a cup of molasses, one cup 
of brown sugar and two cups of 
water. Boil all together five 
minutes. Then thicken with five 
tablespoons flour. Bake with two

APPLE CAKES 

(MissWilUs) 

Two eggs, one cup sugar, one- 
half cup milk, two cups flour, two 
teaspoons baking powder, one 
scant tablespoon Cottolenei melt- 
ed. Measure the flour and add to 
the baking powder; beat the 
eggs; add the sugar and beat 
again; add milk and flour alter- 
nately; the Cottolene is put in 
last. Pour into two greased 
Washington pie plates and put 
the apples on top as thickly as 
you can. If the slices will stand 
up, so much the better. (The 
apples are pared, cut in eighths, 
and these eighths again divided 
into two or three sections). 
Sprinkle with about two table- 
spoons sugar and bake for half an 
hour, or tmtil done. Serve hot. 

COCOANUT CUSTARD 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
One pint milk, two eggs, one-half 
cup sugar, one-half grated nut- 
meg, one cup grated cocoanut. 
Beat the eggs and sugar to- 
gether until light, then add the 
milk, nutmeg and cocoanut. Line

CHINESE DUMPLINGS 

(Miss Wniis) 

Put a quart of ripe tomatoes into

and a little ginger, if liked. Cover 
and let them get boiling hot. 
Meanwhile make a drop batter 
with two cups of sifted flour, two 



teaspoons baking powder, one- 
half teaspoon salt and sufficient 
water to make batter that will 
drop from a spoon. Add a cup 
of cooked sausage meat or highly 
seasoned cooked meat to the 
batter and drop it from a spoon 
on top of the boiling tomatoes, 
(^ver closely and steam for twen- 
ty minutes. Serve dumplings as 
a border around the tomatoes. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS 

(Miss WilHs) 

For six dumplings use half the 
rule for pie crust, and six large 
tart apples. (>>re and pare the 
apples. Divide the paste into 
six parts, and roll out one piece 
into a shape and size that will 
cover the apple. Place an apple 
on this and fill the center with 
sugar, a lump of butter the size 
of a hazelnut and some cinnamon. 
Now draw the paste over the 
apples and press the edges to* 
gether. Put the dumplings in a 
baking pan, the rough side down,^ 
and proceed with the others in the 
same manner. Bake in a moder- 
ately hot oven for half an hour. 
Serve hot with a nutmeg or cold 
sauce. 

SULTANA TARTS

mixed with one-third cup of sugar 
and a little cold milk. Cook in 
double boiler for ten minutes, add 



a little salt and two beaten egg 
yolks, and when cool flavor with 
vanilla and sherry. Before filling 
the shells of pastry, add one-half 
cup of Sultana raisins to the 
custard (if raisins are hard they 
may be softened by adding to hot

meringue made of two egg whites, 
four tablespoons of sugar and a 
little nutmeg and cinnanx>n. 
Brown lightly and serve very 
cold. 



Puddings and Sauces 

Use Cottolene in puddings the same as you would butter, except to use 
one-third less of Cottolene, unless the quantity given is very small. 
The same amount of Cottolene as of butter would make the article 
too rich. Make your rich pudding on days when you have the second 
serving of a roast, or some made-over dish, or at times when the first 
course is less in quantity than usual. 



CUP CUSTARDS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Scald one quart of rich creamy 
milk. Beat four egg yolks; add 
four tablespoons sugar and one- 
half level teaspoon salt and beat 
till thick like cream. Beat the 
whites till foamy, not stiff, mix 
well with the yolks and add hot 
milk. Stand cups in a shallow 
pan in the oven, stir the foam 
down and fill cups to overflow- 
ing, or nearly so. Put hot water 
in the pan and bake in a hot oven, 
watching them carefully that 
they do not scorch. Lay but- 
tered paper over if needed. Test 
with a knife as soon as they begin 
to puff and if clean, not milky, 
they are done. A little nutmeg 



may be used if liked, but many 
prefer the simple flavor of the 
custard, or to boil the sugar to 
caramel. (See page 63. Sago 
pudding.) 

RICE PUDDING 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Known also as creamy, and poor 
man's pudding. Soak for half 
an hour three tablespoons of 
washed rice and three tablespoons 
of sugar, (rounded measure) in a 
quart of milk in a baking dish. 
Bake very slowly, stir up from 
bottom two or three times. Bake 
two or three hours, or till rice is 
soft, whole, and surrounded by a 
rich, creamy synxp. It should 
not bake dry, nor be underdone

When just right it is queen of all 
rice concoctions, and may be 
served hot with butter, or cold 
with cream. Boiled raisins, quar-

half cup sugar in a saucepan till 
brown, add one-half cup water 
and stir into the sago. This gives 
caramel flavor. Turn into a 
greased pudding dish and bake 
about twenty minutes. Eat hot 
with butter. One egg is suffi- 
cient. Do not be tempted to 
make it less delicate by adding 
more. 

SPICE PUDDING

milk and molasses and two table- 
spoons melted Cottolene. Grease 
some half pint tin cups, or small 
Cottolene pail, or half pound 
cans, half fill with the batter, 
cover with greased paper, or the 
tin covers if they have them; set 
them on a pan in a kettle of boil-

BANANA CUSTARD 

(Miss Wfllis) 
Put into a saucepan four table- 
spoons cornstarch, one cup gran- 
ulated sugar, one-third of a cup 
of butter, and beat together until 
mixed smooth, then pour in one 
quart of freshly boiled water. 
Beat the yolks of three eggs very 
light and add the mixture to

be combined for jam. Use one- 
third more of the pieplant, by 



measure, than you do berries. 
Use a little water, only just 
enough to keep the mass from 
burning, and sweeten well. Cook 
for fifteen minutes and seal in 
jars. For pies it may be canned 
with less sugar. 

A little lemon juice, or vinegar, 
improves blueberry pies. 

SNOW PUDDING OR LEMON

juice. When the sugar is. dis- 
solved strain it into a large bowl 
and let it cool. Break three 
eggs and reserve the yolks for a 
custard sauce made as for soft 
custard. Beat the whites slowly 
till firm and as the gelatine be- 
gins to stiffen beat it till light, 
and add it to the egg and beat all 
together till very light and white. 
When stiff enough to drop, turn 
it into a deep glass dish and let it 
become very cold before serving.

add slowly one-half to one cup 
powdered sugar, beat in gradu- 
ally two tablespoons rich fruit 
s)rrup, or wine, or any fresh fruit 
juice, and two to four tablespoons 
thick cream (whipped or not, as 
you have time). Serve hot by 
standing bowl over boiling water 
just before serving, and stirring 
only till melted and creamy. Or, 
serve cold; or, if for hard sauce. 



omit cream and pack it into dish 
for serving and chill till firm. 

SOFT CUSTARD SAUCE 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

One pint milk, three eggs, one- 
half cup powdered sugar, one 
teaspoon vanilla. 

Put the milk on to boil in a 
farina boiler. Beat the eggs and 
sugar together until light and 
creamy, then stir them into the 
boiling milk and stir over the fire 
until they begin to thicken, no 
longer or the sauce will curdle. 
Take from the fire, add the vanilla

Pick over and wash two quarts 
of cranberries in plenty of cold 
water; put them into a porcelain- 
lined saucepan, with a cup of hot 
water, and one pound of sugar, 
and stew them gently until they 
are tender enough to rub through 
a sieve; then use them as a sauce 
for roast pig or turkey, or cool 
the sauce in a jelly mold. If the 
sauce is cooled in molds wet with 
cold water, it will make a jelly 
firm enough to turn out in the 
shape of the molds.

WATER ICES 

0/i^. Lincoln) 

Are made with sweetened fruit 
juices, diluted more or less with 
water. If desired dear and hard, 
they are frozen by using one part 
rock salt and three parts fine ice, 
turning the beater only often 
enough to keep it from becoming 
clogged ; then, after removing the 
beater and packing the mixture 
tightly in the can or mold and 
surrounding it with ice and salt, it 
is left to ripen for an hour or 
more. Boiling the water and 
sugar to a sjniip gives to all 
frozen 'mixtures a finer flavor 
than when used unboiled, and a 
quantity may be prepared to 
save time when needed.

SHERBETS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Are water ices with a creamy 
consistency, obtained by using 
the beaten white of egg, or a little 
gelatine, and turning the crank 
rapidly to make the mixture light. 
Or, they are milk ices flavored 
with fruit juices. 

LEMON SHERBET 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Soak one-half teaspoon of gela- 
tine in one-half cup of cold water 
till soft. Boil four cups of water 
and two cups of sugar ten min- 
utes. Halve six large, juicy lem- 
ons, remove seeds and press out 
the juice; add that with the gela- 
tine to the hot syrup and if 
needed add more sugar; when 
dissolved strain and cool. Freeze 
by turning the crank rapidly 
until creamy arfd stiff. None of 
the volatile oil from the lemon 
rind is used, and many prefer 
this mild, flavor. If lemon ices 
lack brightness, or ai^ too sweet, 
add a little citric acid,. or cream 



of tartar. If the flavor of the 
rind is preferred, steep thin por- 
tions of it in the syrup. 

BANANA SHERBET 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Boil one pint each of sugar and 
water ten minutes; stir hot into 



the beaten whites of t¥ro eggs; 
add one-half cup of lemon juice, 
and the mashed pulp of six banan- 
as. Strain and when cool freeze 
as for sherbet. 

VELVET MILK SHERBET 

(Miss Willis) 

Scald one quart milk in double 
boiler. Add two cups sugar and 
stir until dissolved and milk 
looks blue, then set away to cool; 
when cold, pack the freezer. 
Turn in the cold milk, cover, let 
stand five minutes, then turn 
occasionally until it seems ice 
cold, then add the strained juice 
of three lemons. Turn until the 
sherbet is quite thick. Add a 
meringue made with whites of 
two eggs, and two tablespoons 
powdered sugar. Work thor- 
oughly together, finish freezing, 
repack and set away for two hours 
to ripen. This is delicious. 



Canning and Preserving 

In canning, the jars should be thoroughly washed; the fruits must be 
cooked in the jars or filled into them boiling hot. The lid must be 
sterile and put on the jar while both the jar and the lid are hot, and 
they must not be opened until needed for use. 

Large fruits are better cooked in the jars; small fruits may be 
cooked in a preserving kettle and filled in the jars, providing they are 
carefully handled. Small fruits should be just ripe, not under or over 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 



71 



ripe. This is also a good thing to remember in jelly making. Over- 
ripe fruits will not combine with sugar to make a brittle, clean jelly. 

A good clear sy4\ip for preserving is made by using a pound of 
sugar to half a pint of water; before it begins to boil, beat into it the 
white of an egg slightly beaten ; remove the scum as it rises until it is 
perfectly clear. 

For covering tumblers of jellies and preserves, melted paraffine is 
excellent. Pour it over the perfectly cold jelly and it will form a thin 
crust that is clean, tasteless and durable. It can be taken off and 
used again. Mutton tallow is sometimes used for the same purpose. 



CANNED FRUITS 
Raspberries, etc. 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
One quart berries, one-fourth 
cup water, one-half to one cup 
sugar. Use only fresh fruit, free 
from mold, and rinse quickly; 
one spot of decay will often spoil 
the whole mass. Lay aside the 
large berries, mash the broken 
portions, heat them in the water 
in porcelain kettle till the juice 
flows. Press juice out through 
cheese cloth, add to the sugar and 
when boiling add reserved ber- 
ries; press them with wooden or 
silver spoon under the syrup 
without stirring to break them; 
boil fast three minutes. Have 
large-mouthed jars, pint size 
preferred, with perfect rubbers 
and covers, scalded and standing 
in pan of hot water near by. Put 
on the rubber, skim fruit into 
jar, boil syrup two minutes longer, 
strain into the jar, fill to over- 
flowing, put on cover and clamp, 
wipe and set away. Follow this 
method for other fruit, adding 
more water for blackberries, more 
sugar for strawberries, and use 
less of each for blueberries; cut 
rhubarb in inch pieces and use 



two cups sugar; cut pineapple in 
half inch slices or bits, discarding 
the core, and add one tablespoon 
lemon juice; stone cherries, or a 
part of them at least, and add 
more sugar to the sour varieties. 
Cut large peaches and pears in 
halves, remove skin, core or 
stone; add ^livers of lemon rind 
to pears and a few of the stones 
to peaches. Cook till tender in 
the syrup, or in water if hard, 
allowing two cups of water to 
each quart of pared fruit. Cut 
quinces in quarters, pare and re- 
move all the granular part near 
the core; cook in clear water till 
soft and allow from one to two 
cups of sugar. 

PRESERVES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Follow the same general direc- 
tions as for canning, but allow 
equal weight of sugar and fruit 
and cook the fr^iit longer in the 
syrup, boiling the latter down tilj 
quite thick. 

PRESERVED PEACHES 

(Marion Harland) 
Weigh the fruit after it is pared 
and the stones extracted, and

one of the peaches. Crack one- 
quarter of the stones, extract the 
kernels, break them to pieces and 
boil in just enough water to cover 
them, until soft, when set aside 
to steep in a covered vessel. Put 
a layer of sugar at the bottom of 
the kettle, then one of fruit, and 
so on, until you have used up all 
of both ; set it where it will warm 
slbwly, until the sugar is melted 
and the fruit hot through. Then 
strain the kernel water and add 
it. Boil steadily until the peach- 
es are tender and clear. Take 
them out with a perforated 
skimmer and lay upon large, flat 
dishes, crowding as little as pos- 
sible. Boil the syrup almost to a 
jelly — that is, until clear and 
thick, skimming off all the scum. 
Fill two jars two- thirds full of the 
peaches, pour on the boiling sjrrup 
and, when cold, cover with brandy 
tissue paper, then with cloth, 
lastly with thick paper tied 
tightly over them. The peaches 
shoiild be ready to take off after ^ 
half an hour's boiling; the syrup 
should be boiled fifteen minutes lon- 
ger , fast , and often stirred, to throw 
up the scimi. A few slices of 
pineapple cut up with the peaches 
flavor them finely. 

JELLIES 
Currant, etc. 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Pick over and mash the currants, 
let them drain without pressure 
over night. Measure the juice 
and allow an equal amount of 
fine granulated sugar. Put not 
more than three pints to two 



quarts of the juice on to boil at a 
time, boil fifteen minutes. Have 
the sugar hot in the oven, stir it 
in and when boiling skim it, and 
boil from three to five minutes, or 
till it thickens on a cold plate; 
pour into glasses T^hich have' 
been in hot water, a^^ilrhen cold 
cover with paper. Cut ioit brown 
or white paper one-half inch 
larger than the glass, dip it into 
flour and water mixed to the con- 
sistency of thick milk. Drain, 
spread it on the top, draw the 
edges down smoothly and when 
dry it will be tight as a drumhead. 
Fruit juices that have water 
with them, like stewed apples or 
grapes, should boil long enough to 
evaporate this water; but never 
boil the sugar with the juice more 
than five minutes. Apple jelly 
may be made with one-fourth 
less sugar, and green grapes rer 
quire one-fourth more usually. 
Peaches, strawberries, and rasp- 
berries alone, make a thick syrup, 
which is not jelly; but combined 
with apple or currant juice, they 
will be firm and satisfactory. 

SWEET PICKLES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Boil one quart vinegar, four 
pounds brown sugar and one cup 
of mixed whole cinnamon, all- 
spice, cassia buds and a few cloves 
(tied in a bag), cook in it eight 
pounds of fruit, ten minutes or 
till well scalded. Use ripe toma- 
toes peeled; or peaches, wiped if 
woolly, pared if preferred; pears 
pared, and if hard, stewed till 
tender in clear water; or the rind 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 



73 



from ripe cucumbers, canteloupe, 
or watermelons, cooked till tender 
before cooking it in the pickle. 
For four successive mornings 
drain off the S5rrup, boil it ten 
minutes, and pour hot over the 
fruit. 'P^n seal in jars as usual. 

GRlfe^ TOMATO PICKLE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Slice half a peck of green toma- 
toes, dissolve one cup salt in one 
quart of cold water, ppur it on 
the tomato and, after standing 
two hours, drain through a colan- 
der till quite dry. Add to' the 
tomato one quart of pure cider 
vinegar, one pound of brown 
sugar and one level tablespoon 
each of allspice, mustard and 
cinnamon, and one level teaspoon 
each of pepper, cloves and celery 
seed. Boil all together half an 
hour after it begins boiling and 
then simmer two hours. 

CURRANT CONSERVE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Five pounds of currants freed 
from stems, two pounds seeded 
chopped raisins, five pounds sugar, 
four oranges. Cook currants, rais- 
ins, and sugar together fifteen 
minutes after the mixture reaches 
the boiling point ; add the grated 
rind and juice of oranges and cook 
all together five minutes longer. 
Serve as a relish with meat. 

Gooseberries may be used in 
place of currants. 

CUCUMBER PICKLES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Make a brine strong enough to 
float an egg — one pint of coarse 



salt and six quarts of boiling 
water; boil and skim till clear. 
Pick the cucumbers as they 
ripen, wash carefully without re- 
moving the prickles or breaking 
the skin, leave a bit of the stem 
on, and keep them covered with 
the brine. When you have enough 
for a jar, or after they have stood 
in the brine two days, drain them 
from brine, put into the jar, pour 
boiling spiced vinegar over and 
seal. 

A NEW MARMALADE 
Oranges and Rhubarb in Delicious 

Combination 

(Miss Willis) 
A delicious and little known 

marmalade is made by adding to 
each quart of cut rhubarb six 
oranges and one and one-half 
pounds of granulated sugar. The 
white rind and the seeds are re- 
moved from the oranges, but the 
yellow peel and the fruit are to be 
sHced into the ' porcelain-lined 
preserving kettle after the rhu- 
barb and the sugar are in it. 
This whole is boiled slowly until 
quite done and thick enough to 
suit. Sometimes three instead of 
six oranges are used, and. a pound 
of fine seeded or seedless raisins 
take their place. 

FRESH FRUITS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Oranges, grapefruit and melons. 
Serve very cold, wipe, divide half, 
way down from stem end, remove 
seeds, and eat with a spoon, with 
or without sugar. Berries and 
small fruits: Pick over, hull, 
rinse, drain and serve with sugar.

BAKED BANANAS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Peel, halve them each way, allow 
one level teaspoon sugar, one tea- 
spoon lemon juice and half level 
teaspoon butter for each banana; 
put them in earthen baking dish; 
nearly cover with hot water and

well; soak over night in twice 
their bulk of cold water. Cook 
slowly, closely covered, till tender. 
Skim out fruit, add to the water 
sugar to taste (prunes need but 
little or none, and lemen juice 
improves them), boil five minutes, 
skim and strain syrup over the 
fruit, or boil down till thick if 
liked. 

SPICED GOOSEBERRIES 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Place in the preserving kettle five 
pounds of gooseberries (capped 
and stemmed), one pint of vine- 
gar, four pounds of sugar and two 
tablespoons each of ground cin- 
namon and cloves. (Dook all slow- 
ly for about two hours, stirring it 
very often during the last hour, 
as it scorches easily. Put into a 
crock or in jelly glasses and cover 
with paraffine when cold. This 
keeps indefinitely and is excellent 
with either cold meats or to serve 
with steak. 



Gottolene comes from the snowy 
cotton fields of the Sunny South. 
It is a pure, vegetable -oil short- 
ening—wholesome, nutritious, 
economical; it shortens your food, 
lengthens your life. 



IN VALIP COOKERY 



75 



Invalid Cookery 

There are many food preparations in the market now — ^malted, 
peptonized, albumenized, etc., adapted to nearly every condition, or 
degree of invalidism. Milk has come to be considered by many phy- 
sicians as the most suitable food for those seriously ill, varied by eggs, 
and simple broths ; therefore, it seems unnecessary to' take space for 
more thaif a few of these combinations. Cleanliness and delicacy in 
all appointments* and dainty serving, often add greatly to the value 
of the food, and should never be overlooked. 



BEEF JUICE 

Broil half a pound of lean juicy 
round steak, cut one inch thick, 
until each side is just seared and 
the juice will flow when cut. 
Divide into small pieces and press 
in a lemon squeezer (or a meat 
press if you have one), put the 
juice into a small saucepan and 
stand it in hot water, stir till the 
the liquid is hot, but do not let it 
boil or cook enough to curdle. 
Salt slightly and serve immedi- 
ately. If you have cup in hot 
water and work quickly, there 
will be no need of reheating juice. 

GRUEL 

Have two cups of water (if rolled 
or flaked oatmeal is used— or three 
cups, if granulated meal) and one 
level teaspoon salt boiling briskly 
in top of double boiler. Stir in 
one cup of meal, boil rapidly five 
minutes. Then place top part of 
boiler over the lower part, cover, 
and^cook from 30 to 60 minutes. 
When thoroughly cooked, take 
one-fourth cup of the mush, stir 
into milk or water and rub through 
a strainer. Heat, season and serve. 
Dilute with cream or milk. 



HOT EGGS FOR INVALIDS 

Place a small bowl, suitable for 
serving, in a pan of water just off 
the boiling point ; put in one tea- 
spoon butter and let it run over 
the bottom and sides; break in 
one or two eggs, add a bit of salt, 
and pepper if liked, and stir with 
a spoon till egg is mingled and 
tastes hot; serve at once with 
toast or wafers. This is more 
acceptable to an invalid than is a 
cold raw e^, or a soft egg with 
the white stringy and half- 
cooked. 

JUNKET 

Warm one pint of milk to blood 
heat, dissolve in it one tablespoon 
sugar and one -fourth teaspoon 
salt, flavor with one teaspoon 
vanilla or one tablespoon wine, or 
strong coffee; stir in quickly one 
junket tablet and turn into a dish 
for serving. When firm and cold 
serve with sugar and cream, or 
with any fruit whip made by 
beating one eg'g white and one 
cup of mashed or grated fresh 
fruit, or stewed fruit, slowly till 
stiff. 



A 



After the Meal is Over 



comes the washing . of dishes, and the cleaning of 
greasy, dirty pots and pans. The preparation of 
the meal is usually a pleasure; the clearing up, dis- 
agreeable.

Laundry Soap 



A Quick 
Dirt- 
Starter 



Sunny Monday 

possesses re- 
markable dirt- 
startii^ qual- 
ities. It makes 
the dirt fairly fly before it. 
It saves rubbing, wear and 
tear on clothes, and will en- 
able you to get your wash out 
in half the usual time. 

Will Hot Sonny Monday will .wash woolens and 
flannels, absolutely without shrinking. 
^'''™'^ Nearly all laundry soaps contain con- 

Woolens siderable rosin and this is injurious to 

woolen garments, causing the fibers to 
harden and shrink. Sunny Monday, however, con- 
tains no rosin, and leaves the clothes soft and fleecy 
as they were at first. 

Sunny Monday works well in any kind 
of water — hard or soft, cold or hot. 
You may boil your clothes or not, as 
you may prefer, and with Sunny 
Monday you will get perfect results;, 
the same cannot be said of the numerous naphtha 
soaps on the market today, whose virtue is lost when 
used in anything but cold water.

— Introduction — 

^^3 is the "pure food" age. So much has been written, 
so many laws have been made, so much discussion has 
been rife in favor of this all-important topic for the 
housewife, that we feel no apology or explanation is neces- 
sary for this book of " Home Helps. " 

We have tried to make it just what its name implies-:-^ 
help for the home. Every housewife should have a cook- 
book, whether she bp a bride with little or no experience or a 
past-master in the culinary line. The trouble has been to find 
a book that was N practical, containing mostly simple, everyr 
day, useful recipes, calling for few ingredients and requiring 
little time in preparation. We believe we have succeeded in 
making "Home Helps" the most practical book in this 
respect ever issued. 

The old saying, " Too many cooks spoil the broth " is not 
applicable here, and in selecting the favorite recipes of Mrs. 
Lincoln, Mars. Rorer, Mrs. Armstrong, Marion Harland and 
Miss Willis, we have incorporated a feature never before 
found in one volume. 

We commend this book to the daily use of the millions 
of American housewives who are interested in preparing pure 
foods under the most approved and scientific methods. 
Whether your household " cookery" is in your own hands or, 
that of a hired cook, this volume cannot fail to be invaluable. 
The more you use it, the more good you will get from it. 

While this book is published in the interests of Cottolene, 
the perfect shortening which has been aptly termed " Nature's 
Gift from The Sunny South," and Cottolene, is naturally 
specified as the cooking fat in a number of recipes where 
lard or butter would otherwise be used, there are many 
recipes given where no mention of Cottolene is made; and, 
, furthermore, wherever this superior cotton -oil cooking fat is 
specified, it has only been after careful tests by these famous 
experts have shown it to be preferable to either lard or 
butter from the standpoint of economy, palatability and 
healthfulness. 

Yours for healthful cooking, 

THE N. K. FAIRBANK COMPANY 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



For All Shortening and 

Frying Use Cottolene 

Irnjears ago nothing but butter or lard were used for shortening and 
IBfll frying; to-day the visible supply of these two products is in- 

' ' sufficient to supply the demand, taking into consideration the 

amount of butter required for table use. 

Cottolene is not offered the housewife as a cheap imitation of either 
butter or lard, but as a vegetable product which is superior to either 
for cooking purposes. Because it happens to be about half the price 
of butter, or less, is but an additional reason, from a purely econom- 
ical standpoint, for its use. The main argument for the use of 
Cottolene is the purity of its ingredients and the wholesomeness of 
the food prepared with it. 

There isn't an ounce of hog fat in Cottolene, and from cotton- 
field to kitchen human hands never touch the product. Packed in 
our patent, air-tight tin pails, Cottolene reaches you as fresh as the 
day it was made. Lard and butter are sold in h\iik, and do not have 
this protection. 

Cottolene is always uniform in quality, and because of its freedom 
from moisture it goes one-third farther than butter or lard, both of 
which contain about 20% of water. It is much more economical 
than lard; about 50% more so than butter. 

Cottolene contains no salt, and is richer in shortening properties 
than either butter or lard. Two-thirds of a pound of Cottolene will 
give better results than a pound of either butter or lard. 

Because Cottolene is made from sweet and pure oils, refined by 
our own special process, it makes food more digestible. Its use in- 
sures light, flaky pie-crust; it makes deliciously crisp, tender dough- 
nuts; for cake-making it creams up beautifully and gives results equal 
to the best cooking butter; muffins, fritters, shortcake and all other 
pastry are best when made with Cottolene ; it makes food light and 
rich, but never greasy. Cottolene heats to a higher temperature than 
butter or lard, and cooks so quickly the fat has no chance to soak in. 

Cottolene is just as pure and healthful as olive oil, and is un- 
qualifiedly recommended by leading physicians, domestic science 
authorities and culinary experts as wholesome, digestible and eco- 
nomical. The use of Cottolene in your frying and shortening will both 
save you money and give you better results. * 



HOW TO USE COTTOLENE 



1' 



How^ to Use Cottolene 

If you occasionally buy strong butter or rancid lard you do not 
denounce butter or lard, or give up their use. Be as fair with 
Cottolene. No edible fat will keep indefinitely, when stored 
too long in a warm place, or otherwise abused. 

A general rule for the use of Cottolene as shortening in all mixtures 
is: Use one-third less than the amount given for butter or lard in the 
recipe. 

For cake making, cream the Cottolene as you would butter, add- 
ing a little salt, as it contains none. 

In saut^ing, or browning, use only enough Cottolene to grease the 
pan. Add more fat when you turn the food. Cottolene should be put 
into the pan while cold and after the bottom of the pan is once covered 
with the melted Cottolene, more can be added as desired. Unless 
used in this way, Cottolene may bum and throw off an odor, as 
would any other cooking fat. 

For deep frying, have Cottolene at least deep enough to cover, 
or float, the article being fried, heating slowly. For uncooked mix- 
tures, test with a bit of dough, which should rise at once to the top 
'with some sputtering; the fat should be kept at an even temperature. 
For croquettes, fish balls, or other cooked mixtures which will brown 
jn one minute, test with a block of white bread, which should brown 
in a few seconds. Make this test always — never trust your eye. 

Uncooked fish and meat are better when covered with bread 
crumbs to give the crisp crust desired in fried food. The fat should 
be hot at first, that it may not penetrate, then reduce the heat, that 
the food may cook till done, without burning. Never let the fat heat 
to the smoking point, for then it is burning hot.. Cook only three or 
four pieces at once, for more will chill the fat and prevent perfect 
frying. Clarify the fat after frying, by browning a piece of raw potato 
in lit, then strain through fine cheese cloth. It is then again ready to 
use. 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



What Noted Cooking Ex- 
perts Think of Cottolene 

mn addition to the remarks and recommendations made in other 
parts of this book, the following testimonials received from' 
famous authorities on Domestic Science, attest the high regard 
in which Cottolene is held by all those who have made a careful "tudy

" I use Cottolene in every and all the ways that one would use lard, also in the 
preparation of sweet cakes. 1 consider it an important frying medium and a much 
more healthful product than lard." 

MARION HARLAND 

'' Author of the famous " Marion Harland Cook Book." 

" Many years ago 1 discontinued the use of lard in my kitchen and substituted 
for it — as an experiment — Cottolene, then comparatively a new product. Since my 
first trial of it 1 can truly say that it has given complete satisfaction, whether it is 
used alone, as ' shortening,' or in combination with butter in pastry, biscuits, etc., or 
in frying. I honestly believe it to be the very best thing of its kind ever ofEeied to 
thq American housekeeper." 

MRS. JANET M. HILL 

Editor " Boston Cooking School Magazine." 

" For several years I have used Cottolene in my own kitchen and find it very 
satisfactory. I am glad to commend it." 



MRS. SARAH PEARSON STUART 

Editor Household Department " American Housekeeper" 

" When properly used, Cottolene never makes other than light, wholesome and 
nutritious food, that can be readily digested by the most delicate stomach." 



MRS. HELEN ARMSTRONG 

Jeacher of Cookery. 

" Having used Cottolene constantly for over five years, both as shortening and 
for frying purposes, I feel no hesitancy in recommending it as a very superior article. 
It is not only much more wholesome than lard, but produces more palatable results." 



These are but a few. Other well known authorities who have tested 
Cottolene and recommend its use are : 

Mrs. F. A. Benson Mrs. Emma P. Ewing 

and Mrs. Christine Terhune Herrick

NOTED EXPERTS PRAISE COTTOLENE 7 

eminent Physici^Lns 

endorse Cottolene 

frnline-tenths of all human ailments are due primarily to indiges- 
lUkl ^^'^^ °^ ^^^ aggravated because of it. The chief catise of in- 

' ' digestion is food prepared with lard. The following are but 

brief extracts from, letters received, showing the high esteem in which • 
Cottolene is regarded as a cooking medium by physicians ranking 
among the highest in the profession. 

J. HOBART EGBERT, A. M., M. D., PH. D. 

From an article in the "Medical Summary" entitled "Available 
Facts for Consumptives and Others with W,asting Diseases". 

** In cooking food, we would recommend the preparation known as 'Cottolene', 
a wholesome combination of fresh beef suet and purest cottonseed oil. This prepara- 
tion is both economical and convenient, free from adulterations and impurities, and 
dietetic experiments conclusively show that incorporated in food it yidds to the body 
available nourishment." 

R. OGDEN DOREMUS, M. D., LL. D. 

Professor of Chemistry, Toxicology and Medical Jurisprudence, 
Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York. 

" As a substitute for lard, which is its purpose, Cottolene i)os5e5ses all. the desirable 
qualities of lard without having the objectionable features inherent in all products 
obtained from swine," 

DR. JAMES PAIGE EMERY, 

From an article in the "American Housekeeper" entitled "The 
Most Healthful of All Cooking Fats"- 

Cottolene, being essentially a vegetable product, forms the most healthful and 
nutritious cooking medium known to the food experts and medical profession ," 



WM. JAGO, F. I, C., F. C. S. 

That eminent chemist, William Jago, than whom there is no higher 
authority on cooking fats, reports as follows from Brighton, England: 

"I find Cottolene to consist practically of lOO per cent, pure fat, the following 
being the actual result? obtained by analysis: Percentage of Pure Fat, 99,982, I 
found the 'shortening' effect of 12 ozs, of Cottolene practically equal to that of 1 lb. 
best butter. For hygienic reasons, Cottolene may be used with safety as a perfectly 
harmless and innocuous substitute for other fats employed for dietetic purposes," 



Other eminent Physicians who have endorsed and recommended 
Cottolene are : Henry Seffmann, M. D., Professor of Chemistry, 
Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philads^hia ; Prof. Jesse 
P. Battershall, Ph. S., F. C. S., Chemist U. S. Laboratory, New York;

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



Hoiv to Mea^sure 



Hne cup, or one tablespoon, or one teaspoon, means a full meas- 
ure — all it will hold of liquid, and even with the rim, or edge, of 
dry material. 

Stir up all packed materials, like mustard in its box, and sift flour 
before measuring. Fill cup without shaking down, and dip spoon in 
material, taking up a heaped measure, then with a knife scrape off 
toward the tip till you have level measure. Pack butter or Cottolene 
in cup so there will be no air spaces. - A scant cup means one-eighth less 
and a heaped cup about one-eighth more than a level cup. 

Divide a level spoon lengthwise for a half measure, and a half 
spoon crosswise for quarters or eighths. A pinch means about one- 
eighth, so does a saltspoon ; less than that means a dash or a few grains. 

A rounded tablespoon means filled above the rim as much as the 
spoon hollow below, and equals two of level measure. It also equals 
one ounce in weight, and two rounded tablespoons if put together 
would heap a tablespoon about as high as would an egg, giving us the 
old-tiine measure of "butter size of an egg," or two ounces, or one- 
fourth the cup. Butter and Cottolene and flour for sauces are com- 
monly measured by the rounded tablespoon by the experienced house- 
keeper. 

Except in delicate cake, or where it is creamed with sugar, and in 
pastry — where it should be chilled to make a flaky crust, Cottolene or 
butter may be most quickly and economically measured after it is 
melted. Keep a small supply in a granite cup, and when needed, stand 
the cup in hot water, and when melted, pour the amount desired into 
the spoon or cup. For all kinds of breakfast cakes, it is especially 
helpful to measure it in this way. 

Soda, cream of tartar, baking powder, salt and spices, and some 
extracts, are generally measured with a teaspoon, level measure, for 
this gives the proportional amount needed for the cup measure of 
other materials. ^

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



Beverages 



TEA 

(Mrs, Lincoln) 

Use water freshly boiled. Scald 
the teapot (earthen, granite or 
china); for mild infusions allow 
one-half teaspoon level for each 
cup. Pour the boiling water on 
the tea, cover closely and let it 
stand and infuse, not boil, for five 
minutes. If you have a table 
teakettle, put the tea in a tea ball, 
fill two cups at a time with boil- 
ing water, hold the ball in the 
water till the desired strength is 
secured. At afternoon teas and 
for iced tea, serve lemon slices. 

CHOCOLATE 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

Mix two rounded tablespoons 
sugar, a few grains of salt, and 
one-half level teaspoon cornstarch 
in a granite saucepan, add two 
squares of unsweetened chocolate 
and one-fourth cup of cold water ; 
stir over the fire until melted, 
thick and smooth. Add one cup 
of boiling water and when ready 
to serve add three cups scalded 
milk. Keep it hot over hot water 
until ready to serve. 

CAFf NOIR 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Caf^ Noir (the French for black 
coffee) is made by dripping. It is 
also called "drip coffee." Each half 
pint of water requires a heaping 
tablespoonful of coffee, ground to 
a powder. This powder is placed 



in a thick flannel cloth and laid in 
a strainer. The boiling (it must 
be boiling) water is poured over 
it and allowed to percolate into 
the pot. The flannel should not 
be porous, or the fine powder 
will also find its way through to 
the pot below. Like all other hot 
beverages, it should be served 
immediately. 

BOILED COFFEE 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Boiled coffee is made by pour- 
ing a sufficient quantity, finely 
ground, into the pot; then pour 
in boiling water. This is al- 
lowed to boil, and then taken 
from the fire while the beaten 
white of an egg and the crushed 
shells are placed in the pot. Again 
place on the fire. and let boil about 
one minute; remove and allow to 
stand a few minutes (not more 
than five) and serve. 

CAF^ AU LAIT 

(Miss Willis) 

Make coffee in a drip coffee pot, 
(or in an ordinary coffee pot with- 
out boiling it and immediately 
pouring it off the grovuids), then 
add an equal quantity of good 
rich milk scalded to steaming 
point in a double boiler. Sweeten 
to suit the taste, cover and let 
heat over the boiling water for 
twenty minutes before serving. 
This coffee agrees with everyone 
and the dyspeptic and bilious 



BREAKFAST CAKES, FRITTERS. ETC. 



11 



who have been obliged to give up 
coffee because they cannot enjoy 
it without cream but suffer ill 
effects when cream is combined 
with rich coffee, suffer no incon- 
venience from dfinking caf^ au 
lait. There is a logical and hy- 
gienic reascMi why this is so. 



mulledl grape juice 

(Mrs. Armstiong) 

To one pint grape juice add one 
cup water and half a cup oi cassia 
buds, or several pieces of stick 
cinnamon. Heat in dotible boiler 
half an hour. Strain, and serve 
very hot as first course in luncheon. 



BreaRfast CaKes, Fritters 

an^ Dou^lmuts 

In preparing fritters, beat egg whites separately and add just before 
using. If intended for fruit, add a teaspoon of sugar, and if for meat 
or fish, a tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar. A thin batter is pre- 
ferable to a thick one. In frying doughnuts, fritters, etc., use plenty 
of Cottolene. Let it heat gradually, and be sure that it is hot enough 
before you begin to cook. When the frying is done, the Cottolene 
remaining can be carefully strained to use again. Never mix the fats- 
in which doughnuts, vegetables of fish have been fried. Keep a sepa- 
rate vessel for each. , 



BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Into two cups of sifted pastry 
flour, sift and mix one level tea- 
spoon of salt and four level or two 
rounded teaspoons baking pow- 
der; chop in one level tablespoon 
of chilled Cottolene, wet to a stiff 
dough with about three-fourths 
cup of milk, or half water and 
half milk. Toss out on a floured 
board, pat it down and roll one- 
half inch thick. Cut into small 
rounds and bake in a hot oven. 

SOUR MILK BISCUIT 

(Miss Willis) 

One quart flour; one table- 
spoon salt; one teaspoon soda; 
one pint sour milk. Sift the flour 
with salt and baking soda; flour 



or butter a baking pan and see 
that the oven is hot; wet the 
flour with a pint of sour milk, or 
enough to make a soft dough; 
add one tablespoon of Cottolene, 
by chopping it into the flour ; shape 
the biscuits quickly, put them 
into the pan and bake them in a 
hot oven for about twenty 
minutes. 

CREAM BISCUIT (BAKIHG 
POWDER) 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Sift together one pint of pastry 
flour, three teaspoons of baking 
powder, and half a spoon of. salt. 
Moisten with cream as soft as 
can be handled. Roll out on a 
well floured board, cut in small 
biscuits and place in a pan, 



12 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



brushing over with melted butter 
or cream before baking. Have 
oven very hot, and bake ten or 
fifteen minutes, according to size. 
For milk biscuits use two table- 
spoons of Cottolene to shorten. 
Mixture like this made softer and 
baked in gem pans gives an easy 
and satisfactory drop biscuit. 

ONE-EGG MUFFINS OR 
QUICK SALLY LUHN 

(Miss Willis) 
One and one-half tablespoons 
melted Cottolene ; one tablespoon 
sugar; one and one-half to one 
and three-quarters cup of milk; 
one egg; three cups sifted flour; 
three teaspoons baking powder; 
one scant teaspoon salt. Use 
more or less milk according to 
quality of flour. Sift baking 
powder and flour together; add 
Cottolene, sugar, egg and milk. 

FRIED DROP CAKES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

With one-half cup flour, mix 
one-half saltspoon cinnamon, one- 
half level teaspoon soda and one 
level teaspoon baking powder. 
Add One cup sour milk, one-fourth 
cup molasses, one beaten egg, and 
rye meal or graham flour enough 
to make a soft doUgh that will 
hold in shape when dropped. 
Drop from a teaspoon into hot 
deep Cottolene. When they turn 
pver and are brown, try with a 
fork — if it comes out clean, they 
are done. 

SCALDED CORN MEAL CAKES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Known also as Dabs or Hoe 
Cakes. Mix one-fourth level tea- 



spoon salt with one cup fine 
white com meal (Rhode Island 
and Southern varieties preferred). 
Scald with boiling water sufficient 
to wet and swell every grain and 
have the mixture barely bold to- 
gether. Then thin with cold milk 
to a soft dough that will keep its 
shape. Drop from a tablespoon 
on a griddle well greased with 
Cottolene, or butter, or salt pork 
fat. Shape them as they cook, 
turn them round for uniform 
browning and turn over when 
brown on one side. When done, 
let them stand in the oven for a 
few minutes. They absorb a deal 
of fat in cooking, and when ready 
to turn, put a bit on each, that 
the fresh side may be equally 
well browned. 

SHORTCAKE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Add to the Baking-Powder Bis- 
cuit formula, twice the amount of 
Cottolene, or use only three level 
teaspoons of baking powder, and 
add one egg if you prefer. When 
baked pull the biscuit apart, 
spread with butter and put 
mashed and sweetened berries or 
other fruit, between the crusts 
and over the whole. The biscuits 
are more easily served than large 
cakes. 

POPOVERS 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Beat two large or three small 
eggs well; mix carefully two cups 
flour, half teaspoon of salt and 
two cups of milk with eggs. Pour 
into hot greased irons and bake 
in rather hot oven half an hour 
or more, according to size. Serve 
promptly. 



BREAKFAST CAKES, FRITTERS. ETC. 



13 



OLD TIME CORNBREAD 

(Miss Willis) 

One pint sifted yellow corn 
meal, one pint flour, one pint sour 
milk, two eggs beaten light, one- 
half cup sugar; Cottolene, about 
the size of a small egg, melted 
and added last thing, one tea- 
spoon soda added to the milk. 
Add to the beaten eggs the milk 
and meal alternately, then the 
Cottolene and sugar. Bake 
twenty minutes in hot oven. 

GRIDDLE CAKES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

One cup of sifted flour, (one-third 
of this cup may be entire wheat, 
or fine com meal, or rye meal). 
Before mixing, sift on the flour 
one-half level teaspoon each of 
salt and soda, and one level tea- 
spoon of baking powder. Mix, 
and add one beaten egg and one 
tablespoon of melted Cottolene; 
if the milk is one-third cream, 
omit the Cottolene. Beat well 
and cook on a griddle, greased 
slightly with Cottolene. Flours 
and meals vary, and if the first 
cake is not right, add more flour 
or moisture, as needed. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES 

(Mis. Lincoln) 
At night mix one cup graham 
flour, two cups buckwheat, one 
level teaspoon salt, and moisten 
with warm water to make thick 
batter. , Add two tablespoons 
molasses and one-half cake com- 
pressed yeast, softened in a little 
water. Cover, and let it rise. 
In the morning, stir the batter 
down and thin it, if needed, with 



warm water; and if there be any 
sour odor, add one-fourth level 
teaspoon soda dissolved in a little 
water. When all is ready for 
breakfast, fry the cakes as wanted 
on a griddle greased slightly with 
Cottolene. In all frying on a 
griddle, use only fat enough to 
give a slight film of grease — any 
more than this makes extra work 
for you by burning on and filling 
the room with smoke. 

NEW ENGLAND DOUGHNUTS 

(Miss Willis) 

One quart sifted flour, one-half 
teaspoon salt, one-fourth teaspoon 
grated nutmeg, three teaspoons 
baking powder. Sift all together 
until mixed. Beat two eggs light 
with two ounces (four tablespoons 
or one-fourth cup) Cottolene and 
one cup granulated sugar. Add 
one cup milk and the sifted flour. 
Some qualities of flour require a 
little more milk to make a soft 
dough. Roll out about one-half 
inch thick and cut with a ring 
cutter. When all are cut out, 
have ready the frying kettle with 
sufficient hot Cottolene to float 
the doughnuts while frying. Test 
with a piece of the dough. If it 
comes immediately to the surface 
it is hot enough to begin frying. 
Cook about three minutes, turn- 
ing frequently to keep them 
smooth and like balls. When 
taken from the fat, dust with 
powdered sugar and cinnamon. 

RAISED DOUGHNUTS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

To one pint of risen bread dough, 
work in one cup sugar beaten 



14 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



with two eggs and one teaspoon 
melted Cottolene. Mix a little 
nutmeg, or cinnamon, with one- 
fourth cup of flour; add this, and 
enough more flour to make a stiff 
dough. Roll and cut, and let 
them rise half an hour before 
frying in deep, hot Cottolene. 

APPLE FRITTERS 

(Mrs. Roier) 
Three tart apples; two eggs, one 
cup milk, one teaspoon salt, 
about one and one-half cups flour, 
one teaspoon baking powder. 

Pare and core the apples; cut 
them into rings; dust with sugar 
and cinnamon ; staild aside to use. 
Beat eggs without separating, 
until light; add milk,' salt and 
sufficient flour to make a soft 
batter; beat well and add the 
baking powder; beat again. 
Have ready, very hot, a deep pka 
of Cottolene, dip each ring of 
apple in the batter, drop it in the 
Cottolene and fry until brown. 
Serve hot, dusted with powdered 
sugar. 

FRXnT FRITTERS 

(Miss Willis) 
Almost any kind of fine fruit may 
be served in the form of fritters. 
Apples, bananas, pears, oranges, 
peaches, etc., are all suitable for 
this form of entrfe. Apples 
should be pared, cored and cut 
into round slices about half an 
inch thick. They inay be sea- 
soned with a little lemon jiiice 
and nutmeg, if these flavors be 
liked. ' Bananas should be cut in 
round slices about an inch thick; 
or, they may be cut in halves and 



split. ,Pears may be cut in quarters, 
while oranges may be diviaed 
into sections or cut in slices, care 
being taken to remove the seeds. 
For six people use: One-half 
pint flour, one gill milk, two tea- 
spoons sugar, one-half teaspoon 
salt, two tablespoons melted but- 
ter and two eggs. 

RICE CAKES 

(Miss Willis) 

Half pound rice, four and one- 
half ounces Cottolene, one quart 
milk, four eggs, one-half pound 
flour, one teaspoon baking pow- 
der, a little salt. 

Soak the rice, boil soft, drain 
and mix with the Cottolene; let 
cool, add the milk, salt and eggs. 
Sift in a quarter of a pound of 
flour with a teaspoon of baking 
powder. Bake on well -greased 
griddle. 

POTATO PANCAKES 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

To one quart of raw potato, either 
grated or run through food chop- 
per, add four eggs singly, beating 
each one in thoroughly. Add salt 
and pepper and a little flour, only 
enough to bind the mixture; the 
amount will vary owing to differ- 
ence in potatoes. Fry by the 
spoonful in drippings or Cottolene 
and serve promptly. 

GERMAN CRULLERS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Two eggs; one cup sugar; one 
tablespoon Cottolene ; one cup of 
milk; two cups flour; one tea- 
spoon baking powder; nutmeg; 
flour. 



BREAD AND ROLLS 



15 



Beat the eggs until light, add 
sugar, melted Cottolene and milk; 
mix and add about two cups of 
flour and one teaspoon baking 
powder, sifted together; beat 



well ; add grating of nutmeg and 
sufficient flour to make a soft 
dough; knead lightly; roll out, cut 
and fry . in very hot Cottolene. 
Dust with powdered sugar. 



Bread and Rolls 

Cottolene is wholly adapted to all uses in the kitchen where lard is used 
and in the majority of cases where butter is used. It makes lighter 
biscuit than lard, and be they ever so rich, they are never greasy. It 
is more economical, requiring one-third less than either butter or lard. 
It has no peculiar flavor, no coloring matter and no salt, and in general 
use the amount of salt required with lard should always be used. 

Bread and rolls should rise in a moderately warm place. If in too 
cold a place it will be heavy, and if in too hot, sour. I- +be case of 
soured dough, a teaspoon of soda will correct the sourness of the dough, 
but will not bring back the sweetness of the flour. Bread should rise 
to twice its original size before it is ready to bake, and small loaves 
are always preferable to large ones. 

Rolls and all baking-powder bread require a hotter oven than a 
yeast-raised bread. In using baking powder always sift it twice with 
the flour. A teaspoon of baking powder to each pint of flour is a 
good proportion. 



YEAST BREAD 
Grandmother's Way 

(Miss Willis) 
Place in your bread or mixing 
bowl one heaping teaspoon of 
Cottolene, one teaspoon of salt, 
and one teaspoon of sugar. Pour 
over these one pint of milk which 
has been heated to steaming 
point and stir until the salt and 
sugar are dissolved, then allow to 
cool. When lukewarm, add one- 
half cup of yeast or one-half a 
compressed yeast cake dissolved 
in a little lukewarm water. Then 
stir in enough flour to make a 
rather stiff batter. Beat vigor- 
ously until the batter is perfectly 



smooth and full of air bubbles. 
Cover with a cloth and lid to 
exclude the air and set in a warm 
place to rise. The kitchen table 
is near enough the fire in summer. 
In the winter have a temperature 
of about seventy degrees Fahr. 
When the batter doubles its bulk

before, and set to rise again. When 
the dough doubles its bulk place 
again on the moulding board and

MILK BREAD 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
(Without kneading.) Scald one 
cup of milk and melt in it one 
level teaspoon Cottolene, one 
level teaspoon sugar and one-half 
level teaspoon salt. When cool, 
add one-half cake compressed 
yeast softened in one-half cup 
lukewarm water. Stir in about 
one and one-half cups of white 
flour, or enough to make a drop 
batter after beating well. Cover 
and place the bowl in a pan of 
warm water as hot as you can 
bear your hand in. Keep the 
water at the same temperature 
until the batter is full of bubbles, 
about an hour. Stir in enough 
more flour to make a dough that 
will keep up round after you stop 
stirring. Cut through, and turn 
over with a broad knife, and if it 
settles to a level it needs a trifle 
more flour. Cut and stir it till no 
dry flour is seen, then cover and 
stand again in the pan of warm 
water, and after another hour it 
should be doubled in bulk. If 
you are not ready to attend to it 
then, cut it s.way from the bowl, 
turn the dough over and over and 
let it rise again for a short time. 



This liberates some of the gas 
and" prevents the fermentation 
going on to the sour state. Toss 
out on floured board and shape 
into one long loaf, or divide and 
make two round loaves — place 
them close together in a brick 
loaf pan and let rise till doubled 
in bulk. Then bake in hot oven 
about forty minutes. Remove 
and stand on end till cool, 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix one pint of com meal and one 
pint of rye meal ; or, if rye is not 
liked, use graham meal; or use 
one cup of rolled oatmeal and one 
cup of white flour with the pint of 
com meal. Add one level tea- 
spoon Bait, one level teaspoon 
baking powder, two level tea- 
spoons soda, and moisten with 
one pint of sour milk, or butter- 
milk, and one cup molasses. If 
too stiff, thin with a little water, 
after beating well. Grease pound 
size baking powder cans with 
Cottolene and half fill with the 
batter, cover, and steam three 
hours. Half a cup of seeded 
raisins or stewed , prunes, cut 
small, may be mixed into the 
batter. 

SOUTHERN BROWN BREAD 

(Miss Willis) 

One-half pound fat salt pork

one cup molasses, rounded tea- 
spoon soda mixed with molasses 
until it foams, mix in pork and 
water. Take one pint milk, put 
in half and mix with other; ingre- 
dients. Beat, add rest milk and 
floured raisins, pour in five pound 
lard pail, cover closely. Steam 
three hours and bake one-half 
hour. 

SALT-RISING BREAD 

(Miss Willis) 
One pint of new milk, com meal 
to thicken, one gallon flour, one 
tablespoon sugar, one teaspoon 
salt, pinch soda. 

Set the milk on the fire and 
stir in com meal to make as thick 
as mush. Set in a warm place 
all night. In the morning it will 
be light. Put the flour in a bowl, 
poiir in the mush and mix with 
warm milk and water, equal parts ; 
add the sugar, salt and soda. 
Make a stiff batter, cover and keep 
warm. In an hour it will be light. 
Work in flour to make stiff dough, 
let it rise, mold in loaves, put in 
greased pans, let it rise and bake. 
This makes the sweetest and most 
wholesome bread a family can use. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Soften one cake of compressed 
yeast in one-fourth cup of water. 
Sift a scant quart of whole wheat 
flour into a bowl, with two tea- 
spoons of salt and one - fourth 
cup of sugar, and make into a 
batter with a pint of warm milk 
and the yeast. Beat well and 



work in sifted flour until the 
bread can be handled lightly on 
the board. Place in greased 
bowl, cover well and leave in a 
warm place. Shape into two small 
loaves when light and bake in' a 
moderate oven about forty-five 
minutes, brushing with soft butter 
just before placing them in the 
oven. For nut loaves a cup and 
a half of sliced nuts (pecans and 
English walnuts) may be added 
with the flour. 

SALLY LUKN 
(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Sift together one pint of flour, 
two tablespoons of sugar and a 
little salt. Warm a scant cup of 
milk and melt in this two table- 
spoons of Cottolene. Stir into 
the flour, adding alsd a half cake 
of compressed yeast dissolved in 
a little lukewarm water. Beat 
very well ; add one egg, yolk and 
white beaten s^arately. Pour 
all into buttered calke pan and let 
rise until double its bulk, about 
two hours. Sprinkle lightly with 
granulated sugar and bake in a 
moderately hot oven. Serve 
warm, cut into squares. If set 
over night for breakfast, one- 
fourth as much yeast is required. 

MILK ROLLS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Proceed as for Milk Bread, but 
instead of shaping into loaves, 
divide the dough into smaU por- 
tions and roll each with your hand 
into round shape for common 
biscuit. Bake them in muffin 
pans if liked crusty, or roll each 



18 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



ball tinder the hand on the board 
until about a finger's length. 
Place them close together in two 
rows in a long, shallow pan, with 
a bit of softened butter between, 
if you like them richer. Some dip 
one edge of each roll in melted 
butter before placing in the pan. 
Other varieties may be made from 
this same soft dough. Roll into 
long strips and plait three to- 
gether, making a braid or simply 
twist two together, or bake each 
in a long strip, or stick, or tie a 
bow-knot, or join in rings, or link 
several rings together. 

French RoUs are made by roll- 
ing dough between the hands into 
small oval shapes about a finger 
long, tapering at each end, and 
put together in pairs; or rolling 
into egg-shaped pieces and cutting 
them half through the middle. 
Another shape is first a ball, then 
cut it half through each way, top 
to bottom, and right to left. 
Long rolls are shaped and cut 
across in slanting cuts; or the 
whole mass of dough is rolled 
under the hand and made into a 
large ring, pinching the ends to- 
gether; then cut half way through, 
two inches apart, with a scissors. 
A knife dipped in melted Cottolene 
keeps these cuts from coming 
together. 

OTHER ROLLS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Two thin rounds with thin coat- 
ing of butter between will give 
you a Sandwich Roll, that will 
pull apart easily after baking. 
A thin piece about four inches 



square, divided diagonally, and 
each half rolled from the broad 
side toward the point, and the 
ends curved round like a horse- 
shoe, gives the Crescent shape. 
All of these varieties may be made 
from this formula for Milk Bread, 
and will save you the trouble 
of remembering many recipes. 
If you do not care for shorten- 
ing, or sugar, in bread, simply 
omit them; and if you like a 
richer roll, add more butter to the 
second mixing. Rolls should rise 
in the pans slowly; and when 
making both bread and rolls, 
bake the bread first; rolls should 
rise all they will before baking, 
and the oven should be hot enough 
for them to brown almost at 
once, and thus check any further 
rising in the oven. Being small, 
the heat penetrates through them 
quickly and sets the dough cells. 
In the loaf, however, which is 
thicker, some time is required for 
the heat to reach the center, and 
the dough goes on rising in the 
oven till the center cells are check- 
ed; therefore, it should not rise 
too long in the pan, and the heat 
for bread should be sufficient to 
arrest this rising before the cells 
break and run together, making 
a large hole in the loaf. Rolls 
are made more crisp by rubbing 
the crust with butter, twisted 
into a bit of cloth, as soon as they 
come from oven. 

QUICK COFFEE CAKE 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Sift together twice, one pint of 
flour, one-third cup of sugar. 



CAKES

three teaspoons of baking powder 
and a half teaspoon each of salt 
and ground cinnamon. Mix to a 
soft dough with about half a cup 
of milk stirred into a well beaten 
egg. Add three tablespoons of 
melted Cottolene, spread in a 
shallow pan, sprinkle with sugar 
mixed with cinnamon, and bake 
in a moderate oven. 

CINNAMON BUNS 

(Miss Waiis) 

Scald a pint of milk ; • add a quar- 
ter pound of Cottolene, two table- 
spoons of sugar and one yeast 



cake, dissolved; add two eggs, 
well beaten, and sufficient flour 
to make a soft dQUgh. Knead 
lightly; put aside in a warm place. 
When very light roll into a sheet ; 
spread with butter and dust with 
sugar and then with currants. 
Cut into buns. Stand them in a 
greased pan, and when very light 
bake in a moderate oven three- 
quarters of an hour. 



MRS. JANET M. HILL, Editor Boaton 
GooklnK School Magazine says : " For 
several years I have used COTTOLENE 
In my kitchen and find it very satisfactory. 
I am glad to recommend It." 



There are a few golden rules to be remembered in cake making. Beat 
the Cottolene and sugar together until very light before putting in the 
other materials; then add the yolks of the eggs, the liquid (either water 
or milk), then the flour, with which you have sifted the baking powder, 
and lastly the whites of eggs. 

Here again remember that one-third less Cottolene must be used 
than butter or lard in the same recipe. 

Sweet milk will make a cake rich and close; water in the same 
cake will make it light ar^d delicate. 

In nearly all recipes beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately. 

Always sift the flour before measuring, then add the baking powder 
and sift again once or twice. 

Pastry flour makes a much lighter cake than bread flour; where 
real pastry flour cannot be obtained, the soft winter white flour will 
answer the purpose. 



GENUINE OLD-TIME SPONGE 
CAKE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

The weight of the eggs in sugar, 
and half their weight in flour. 
This enables you to make a cake 
of- any size you desire. The usual 



proportion for one loaf, by meas- 
ure, is four large or five small 
eggs, one cup of fine granulated 
sugar, and one cup of sifted pastry 
flour, the grated rind and juice of 
half a lemon. Beat yolks tiU 
thick and very creamy, add sugar. 



20 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



and beat till light colored; add 
lemon. Beat whites till stifi and 
nearly dry, and fold them in with 
care, so as not to break down the 
bubbles, sift in the flour lightly, 
and fold over (not stir) till just 
barely covered. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven from forty to fifty 
minutes. You will look ,far to 
find a better sponge cake than 
this when properly made and 
baked. 

ONE EGG CAKE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

One-third cup Cottolene, one cup 
sugar, one egg, one teaspoon 
vanilla, one-half teaspoon soda, 
one teaspoon cream of tartar, two 
cups flour, one cup milk. 

Rub the Cottolene and sugar to 
a light cream ; add the well beaten 
yolk of egg and vanilla. Mix 
together the soda, cream of tartar 
and flour, and stir into the sugar 
mixture alternately with the milk. 
Add the well beaten white of egg 
last. Bake in a shallow pan in a 
moderate oven about half an 
hour. Two level teaspoons of 
baking powder may be used in- 
stead of the soda and cream of 
tartar. 

SUNSHINE CAKE 

(Mrs. Armstrqng) 

Have ready one cup sifted granu- 
lated sugar, also two-thirds cup 
of flour with two-thirds teaspoon 
cream of tartar sifted four times. 
Beat seven whites of eggs very 
light, with speck of salt, add

beaten thick and light, then flour 



and scant teaspoon extract lemon 
or orange. Bake in ungreased 
pan slowly about fifty minutes 
and cool in pan inverted. Re- 
move from the pan and cover 
thickly with sweetened and fla- 
vored whipped cream. Garnish 
with candied cherries or nuts and 
serve. 

ALMOND CREAM CAKE 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Cream one-half cup of butter and 
Cottolene packed together, add 
one cup of sugar, and mix in al- 
ternately one-half cup of milk or 
water and two cups of pastry 
flour sifted three times with two 
teaspoons baking powder. Beat 
well, flavor and add five stifiiy- 
beaten whites. Bake in two 
layers. 

Whip sweetened cream until 
stiff; flavor with almond extract 
and sherry; add chopped blanched 
almonds and spread between and 
over the layers. , Garnish with

pans, and bake the cakes in a 
moderate oven until a broom 
straw can be thrust into them 
and withdrawn clean and dry. 

ORANGE LAYER CAKE 

(Miss WaUs) 
Cream one=half cup Cottolene 
with one cup sugar until very 
light. Add three eggs, one at a 
time, beating each one in five 
minutes before adding another. 
Sift two teaspoons of baking 
powder with two cups sifted 
flour, mixing thoroughly, and 
add to the other materials, alter- 
nating with a half cup of milk 
or water (water, if the cake 
is to be eaten while fresh). 
Beat batter well after all ingre- 
dients are in. Bake in two layers 
in a moderately hot oven for about 
twenty minutes. 

POUND CAKE 

(Miss Willis) 

Scant one-fourth pound Cotto- 
lene; one-haU pound sugar; six 
eggs; one-half pound flour; vanilla 
extract. 

The excellence of thiscake de- 
pends entirely upon the rapidity 
and lightness with which tlie bat- 
ter is' beaten, and sometimes sev- 
eral efforts are necessary before 
it proves a perfect success in the 
making and baking. The baking 
has everything to do with success; 
the cake pan should be lined with 
soft writing paper, and a test of 
the oven made to see if the tem- 
perature is right — if a piece of 
writing paper turns brownish- 
yellow when left in the oven for 



two or three minutes the heat is 
right for baking cake. Put in a 
mixing bowl half a pound of sugar, 
beaten to a cream with a scant 
half pound of Cottolene, and beat 
one egg into them for two minutes, 
until six eggs have been used, 
beating each egg two minutes. 
Flavor with twenty drops of the 
strongest vanilla extract. Last 
of all sift in the half pound of 
flour, beating all the time until a 
smooth light batter is formed; 
this should be carefully baked as 
directed above. The French pas- 
try cooks beat cake batter with 
the hand. 

HARLEQUIN CAKE

lene and sugar; add the well- 
beaten egg yolks, and when this 
is light add the milk. Mix to- 
gether the flour and baking pow- 
der, and stir into the egg mixture. 
Beat the egg whites stiff and beat 
them thoroughly into the dough. 
When it is light and fine grained 
divide the dough into four equal 
parts. Have two parts, the color 
of the dough. Color the thirdr 
with one square of unsweetened 
chocolate, melted. Color the 
fourth with pink coloring, and 
bake each part in a Washington 
pie plate. When all are done,

stir well until it cleaves from the 
pan; it will take about five 
minutes. Let the mixture cool, 
then add the eggs, one at a time, 
and beat each egg in thoroughly 
before adding another. When 
well mixed, drop in small table- 
spoonfuls, on a buttered baking 
pan, some distance apart to allow 
for spreading. Bake about thirty 
minutes in a hot oven until well 
risen, then decrease the heat and 
be careful to bake them until 
done. Split when cool and fiU 
with cream.

SOUR MILK GINGER CAKES 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

Mix two and one-fourth cups 
sifted pastry flour, one level tea- 
spoon soda, one-half level tea- 
spoon salt, one level tablespoon 
ginger, and one cup sugar. Stir 
in one cup sour milk, one-half cup 
molasses and two tablespoons 
melted Cottolene (half that amount 
if the milk is creamy). Beat 
well, and bake in muffin tins. 

COCOA TEA CAKES 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Cream a scant half cup of Cotto- 
lene and beat into it gradually 
one cup of sugar. Then beat in 
three eggs, singly, until the mix- 
ture is light and smooth. Add 
alternately one-half cup of milk 
and about a cup and two-thirds 
of flour sifted with two teaspoons 
of baking powder and a quarter of 
a cup of cocoa. Beat well and 
bake in a moderate oven either in 
muffin tins or a shallow pan. Nuts 
may be added, if desired. 

GINGER SNAPS 

(Miss Willis) 

Half pint sugar, one-half pint 
molasses, one-half pint Cottolene, 
one gill cold water, one tablespoon 
ginger, one-half tablespoon cinna- 
mon, one teaspoon soda, one tea- 
spoon salt; three pints flour. 

Beat the Cottolene in a warm 
mixing bowl until soft and creamy. 
Gradually beat the sugar and 
molasses into this, and then add 
the salt and spice. Dissolve the 
soda in the cold water and stir 
this in. Now gradually work in 



the flour, beating well. Put a 
small piece of the dough on a 
floured board and roll as thin as 
a wafer. Cut into round cakes 
and bake on a greased pan in 
rather a quick oven. If there 
be time, these cakes may be 
rolled thinner and with greater 
ease if the mixture be chilled 
before being rolled.

in one-fourth cup cold water, 
add to the cooled molasses, then 
stir in from three to four cups 
flour, making a soft dough to drop 
and spread in a pan, or a stiff 
dough to be rolled and cut. Bake 
in moderate oven. 

SOFT FROSTING 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Stir one level teaspoon butter, 
one-fourth cup milk and one cup 
sugar till it boils, then boil with- 
out stirring five minutes. Re- 
move, beat rapidly, add one tea- 
spoon lemon juice and before it is 
very stiff pour it over the cake 
and smooth with a knife. 

ORANGE ICING 

(Miss Willis) 

Separate an egg; drop the yolk 
into a bowl and beat until thick 
and light colored. Then add

strained juice of a small thin- 
skinned orange and the grated 
yellow rind. Beat in enough 
confectioner's sugar to make an 
icing stiff enough to spread. A 
tablespoon of lemon juice im- 
proves this icing. 

MAPLE CREAM FILLING 

(Miss Willis) 

Three-fourths cup maple sugar 
and one level tablespoon Cotto- 
lene or two of butter, cooked~until 
it spins a thread. Then pour 
gradually into stiffly beaten whites 
of two eggs. Beat until smooth 
and add half a cup of cream whip- 
ped to a stiff dry foam. Flavor 
with a few drops of vanilla. 

CHOCOLATE FROSTING 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Shave three squares of chocolate 
and add one cup of sugar and one- 
fourth cup of milk. Cook this 



over hot water until thick, add 
two beaten egg yolks and cook 
until smooth; then remove and 
spread on cake. 

CARAMEL NUT FILLING 

(Miss Willis) 

Three cups brown coffee sugar, 
one-half cup cream or condensed 
milk and one-fourth cup water, 
one tablespoon butter, one tea- 
spoon vanilla. Boil all the in- 
gredients except vanilla, about 
five minutes. Remove from tlie 
fire, add the flavoring and beat 
until it begins to thicken, add 
one-half cup or two-thirds cup 
nut meats and spread. 



Dr. James Paige Emery, in an article 
in the "American HouaelEeeper" entitled 
"Tile Most Healtliful of All Cooldng Fata," 
says: "Cottolene, being essentially a Teg- 
etable product, forma the most healthful 
and nutritious cooking medium knoTra to 
food experts and the nledical profession.", 



Egg's 



BOILED EGGS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

In a covered stew-pan have suffi- 
cient boiling water to more than 
cover the eggs. Drop them in 
when water boils, using a spoon 
to prevent cracking; when boil- 
ing begins again cover them, turn 
off the heat and let them stand — 
six to eight minutes for soft tex- 
ture, and ten for medium, boil 
igently twenty minutes for hard. 
Fresh eggs are fuller, contain more 
albumen than when older, and 



take longer time for cooking. 
Eggs cooked six minutes in an 
uncovered pan with water bub- 
bling gently all over, will have a 
firm but not hard texture to the 
white and the yolk will be like 
thick cream, not running over 
the white when' cut. 

FRIED EGGS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Boil six eggs twenty minutes, and 
remove shells. Cook one-half cup 
of stale bread crumbs in one-half 
cup of milk, to a smooth paste; 



EGGS

mix with it one cup fine chopped 
tongue, ham or chicken; season 
with salt and pepper, add one raw 
egg and when well mixed take a 
portion, about one-sixth, and 
make it about half an inch thick, 
put an egg in center and work up 
the paste until the egg is covered. 
Roll in a slight coating of fine 
bread crumbs and fry about two 
minutes in hot deep Cottolene. 

POACHED EGGS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Drop perfect eggs in a sufficient 
amount of boiling water to cover; 
do not allow them to boil; but 
let them steam until the white is 
jelly-like and the yolk entirely 
covered. Serve on toast. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

(Miss Willis) 

Take a small piece of butter and 
a little cream, warm in a frying 
pan. Break six eggs in it and stir 
until slightly cooked. Serve hot. 
Or, scramble in Cottolene. 

CREAM OMELET 

(Mrs, Lincoln) 

Allow from one to two tablespoons 
of thick cream for each egg. Beat 
till well mixed but not frothy; 



season lightly with salt and pep- 
per, and cook in portions (hot 
more than two eggs at a time) in 
hot omelet pan, greased slightly 
with Cottolene or butter. Draw 
the egg back toward the middle 
(tip the pan to help it to run 
there) as it thickens, and when 
all the egg is set, or does not flow 
when pan is tipped, turn one-half 
over and toss out on a hot dish. 
If other seasonings like minced 
ham, parsley, cheese, oysters, etc., 
are desired, add them just before 
folding. 

OMELET WITH CHEESE 

(Miss Willis) 
Four eggs, one-half cup milk, one 
teaspoon fiour, a little parsley, 
pepper and salt, one-half teaspoon 
grated cheese, one tablespoon 
Cottolene. ' 

Beat the eggs very light and 
then add the other ingredients. 
Beat all well together and pour 
into a pan in which a large table- 
spoon of Cottoleae is heated. Let 
it cook till light brown, then fold 
it over and dish for the table. 
Shake the pan while the omelet 
is cooking. Must be eaten the 
instant it is removed from the pan. 



FisK and Sliell Fish 

Salt mackerel and other small salt fish should be broiled. Small pan 
fish and steaks of large white dry fish are good fried. Fresh salmon, 
mackerel and bluefish are oily fish and should not be fried. Boil oily 
fish if large— broil them if small. Cod, haddock, bluefish, small 
salmon, bass and shad may be stuffed and baked whole.

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



FRIED FISH 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Fry smelts, perch, trout, butter 
fish, herring and other small pan 
fish whole. Cut large fish in 
inch thick slices, and two or three 
inches square; flounders and bass, 
strip off the flesh each side of bone 
in long fillets, divide in halves 
and roll up toward tip. Remove 
skin and bones as much as possible 
from sliced fish ; wipe dry, roll in 
bread crumbs or fine meal, then 
in beaten egg and then in crumbs 
and fry in deep Cottolene, hot 
enough to brown a bit of bread 
while you count sixty. Drain 
well ^ before serving. Or, simply 
cover with seasoned meal and 
brown on each side in hot Cotto- 
lene in fr3^ng pan. 

SALT CODFISH 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Cover with cold water and strip 
into bits; soak over night. Heat 
slowly and simmer ten minutes 
just off the boiling point. Drain 
and stir it into one cup white 
sauce (see page 41), add one 
beaten egg just before serving. 
Serve hot with baked potatoes. 
Of mix with an equal amount of 
boiled potatoes, add butter, salt 
and pepper, and drop from a 
tablespoon into hot Cottolene in 
spider; shape out flat and round 
as they cook and turn when one 
side is brown. 

Large flakes of salt codfish, if 
not very dry, may be scorched 
on the coals, or broiled.and served 
with butter. A tempting relish. 



BROILED FISH 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
The best method for mackerel, 
whitefish, small bluefish, and shad: 
Clean, wipe, split down back, lay 
in greased wire broiler (kept only 
for fish) and cook flesh side first, 
over hot coals till brown. For 
dry fish like hahbut, cod, etc., 
spread with butter after they are 
warmed through, to help the 
browning. Turn the broiler and 
cook skin side till crisp. Slide 
out on a platter, season with salt, 
pepper, butter and lemon juice. 
To broil under gas, lay the broiler 
over a pan to catch the dripping 
fat, and keep this pan only for 
fish. 

CREAMED FISH 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Pick into flakes, sufficient cold 
cooked fish to make one pint. 
Rub together one rounding table- 
spoon of butter, and one of 
flour; add a half pint of milk, 
stir until boiling, add one table- 
spoon of salt, a saltspoon of black 
pepper and the fish. Heat and 
serve in a border of mashed pota- 
toes. 

BAKED FISH 

(Miss Willis) 
Have the fish drawn from the 
gills if possible. Stuff with 'fol- 
lowing: Season a pint of soft 
bread crumbs with salt, pepper 
and onion juice to taste. Add a 
tablespoon chopped parsley and 
niix well, then moisten with 
crumbs with melted butter. About 
two tablespoons of fat salt pork 



FISH AND SHELL FISH

minced fine makes a richer dress- 
ing. Sew tip the fish to retain 
stuffing and on the upper side 
lard the fish with bits of fat salt 
pork. Bake from thirty to forty 
minutes in good oven. A few 
chopped gherkins or pickles may 
be mixed with the stuffing, es- 
pecially with bluefish. 

FISH BALLS 

(Miss Waiis) 

One pint of shredded salt fish, 
ten potatoes of medium size, one 
egg, one tablespoon of butter, 
one-quarter teaspoon of pepper; 
one-half teaspoon of salt, Cotto- 
lene for frying. 

Have the salt codfish shredded 
rather fine and freed from bones. 
Pare the potatoes and put them 
in a large stewpan. Sprinkle the 
fish over the potatoes and cover 
with boiling water. Place on the 
fire and cook for just thirty 
minutes. Drain off 6very drop 
of the water and mash the fish 
and potatoes fine and light. Now 
add the butter, salt, pepper and 
egg, well" beaten. Beat, for three 
minutes; then shape into smooth 
balls about the size of a small egg. 
Put into the frying basket and 
fry about five minutes. 

If it be inconvenient to use the 
frying basket the fish balls may be 
dropped into the hot fat and, 
when browned, be taken out with 
a fork. Be sure that the fat is 
hot enough, and do not crowd 
the fish balls. Six or eight will 
be enough to fry at one time. 



FISH m VENETIAN STYLE 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Almost any firm fish can be used 
for this dish, either cut into slices 
or split open and boned. Place 
the fish in a shallow baking pan 
and sprinkle with lemon juice, 
adding also salt and pepper. 
Have in readiness one-fourth cup 
each of celery and carrot and 
two tablespoons each of green 
pepper and parsley, with one of 
onion, all chopped together very 
fine. Simmer this for ten minutes 
with one-fourth cup of olive oil, 
then spread over the fish, cover 
closely with another pan and bake 
until fish is done, from twenty to 
thirty minutes. 

FISH CUTLETS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Half pint milk, three teaspoons 
Cottolene, three even tablespoons

FRIED OYSTERS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use large oysters, parboil a mo- 
ment to draw out some of the 
juice and prevent spattering dur- 
ing the frying. Lay them in 
seasoned bread crumbs, beaten 
egg, and again in bread crumbs 
and brown a few at a time, in deep 
smoking-hot Cottolene. 

CREAMED OYSTERS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Parboil one pint of solid oysters 
till edges curl. Drain and add to 
the liquor, milk or thin cream 
enough to make one and one-half 
cups. Melt two tablespoons but- 
ter or Cottolene in saucepan and 
cook in it for five minutes (without 
browning) one teaspoon minced 
onion, one tablespoon minced 
sweet pepper, green or red, and 
one tablespoon minced celery. 
Stir in two tablespoons flour and 
when blended add gradually the 
hot liquid, stir till smooth, add the 
oysters, cook a moment longer 
and serve in the pie. Or, if you 
prefer, you may invert the deep 
pan, lay the paste over, and fit it 
to the bottom and sides and bake 
it, baking also a portion cut to fit 
the pan for a cover, on another 
plate. When done,. remove the 
baked crust (or shell), fill with 
oysters, cover with the cooked 
top, and serve in a deep table dish. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

(Marion Harland) 

Crush and roll several handfuls 
of Boston or other friable crack- 
ers. Put a layer in the bottom of 
a buttered pudding dish. Wet this 



with a mixture of the oyster liquor 
and milk, slightly warmed. Next 
have a layer of oysters. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and lay 
small bits of Cottolene upon them. 
Then another layer of moistened 
crumbs, and so on until the dish 
is fuU. Let the top layer be of 
crumbs, thicker than the rest 
and beat an egg into the milk you 
pour over them. Stick bits of 
Cottolene thickly over it, cover 
the dish, set it in the oven, bake 
half an hour; if the dish be large, 
remove the cover, and brown by 
setting it upon the upper grating 
of oven, or by holding a hot shovel 
over it. 

OYSTER CHOWDER 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Cook one minced onion in. a level 
tablespoon Cottolene in saucepan 
till slightly colored; add one cup 
hot water and stir well; then 
strain this water into kettle, and 
add one pint of thin sliced pota- 
toes. Oaok till soft, about ten 
minutes. Add one pint of oysters 
and from one cup to one pint of 
white sauce (see page 41) and a 
few oyster crackers. When oys- 
ters are plump, serve. 

OYSTER SHORTCAKE 

(Miss Willis) 

Make a good shortcake and bake 
on pie plates. Put a quart of 
oysters on a stove with a little 
water, half a cup of milk, two 
teaspoons of Cottolene, salt and

DEVILED CRABS 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

Twelve nice heavy crabs, one- 
half pint cream, two tablespoons 
flour, one-quarter grated nutmeg, 
four egg yolks, boiled hard, one 
tablespoon each of salt, butter 
and (Chopped parsley, salt and 
cayenne to taste. 

Put the crabs in warm water; 
add the salt and put the kettle 
over a brisk fire. Boil thirty 
minutes. Take up and drain; 
break off all claws; separate the 
shells ; remove the spongy fingers 
and the stomach, which is found 



under the head. Pick out all the 
meat. Put the cream on to boil, 
rub butter and flour together and 
add to the boiling cream; stir and 
co(!)k two minutes. Take from 
the fire, add the crab meat, the 
egg yolks niashed fine, parsley, 
nutmeg, salt and cayenne. Clear 
the upper shells of the crabs, fill 
them with the mixture, brush

bread crumbs and put in a quick 
oven to brown; or better, put 
them in a frying basket and plunge 
into hot Cottolene until a nice 
brown. 



eat, Fotiltry and Ga^ie 

Exact recipes are not so helpftil in learning about meat cookery, as 
they are in flour preparations. It is the principle involved in the dif- 
ferent methods which one needs most to know; and this it seemed 
could be shown more clearly by grouping the meats, etc., by methods, 
rather than by giving separate recipes for every form of cooking each 
kind of meat. 

In purchasing beef, select that with amoderate amount of cream-col- 
ored fat; avoid the dark, yellow fat; it bespeaks an old animal. The 
lean should be lightly mottled with fat, and the flesh should be firm 
and of a good, dark red color. Never wash beef; scrape the outside, 
if necessary, or it may b^ wiped with a damp cloth, but never put in 
water, nor put directly on the ice, but put in the lower part of the re- 
frigerator or in a cool place. Never salt meat before it is cooked; 
wait until it is partly done. 

AU meats should be cooked quickly at first to retain the juices. 
Boiled meat should be put in boiling water, baked meat in a very 
hot oven, and panned or broiled meat in a hot pan; then they may 
be cooked more slowly after the outside is seared. 

Of the most desirable methods of cooking beef, perhaps broiling or 
grilling is best, as it preserves the juices and develops the flavor. 
Roasted beef, that done before the fire, is excellent It is said boiled 
meat is more easily digested than either baked or roasted meats, on 
account of the overheating of the fat in the oven. Baking, however, 



32 



PURE FOOD RECIPES 



develops the greatest flavor. Tender meats are best broiled, roasted 
or baked; the tough or so-called inferior pieces are best braised, boiled 
or stewed. 

Do ndt buy cold storage poultry if possible to get it freshly killed. 
Game is one of the most expensive meats and the average family can 
indulge in it only occasionally. A general rule for cooking meat; — 
dark nieats like beef and mutton, and some dark meated game, like 
wild ducks and grouse, should be cooked rare, but lamb, veal, pork, 
chicken, partridge, and some birds are cooked well done. 



ROAST OF BEEF 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Select choice rib roast and remove 
small end of bone, to use as short 
ribs or for stock, leaving a stand- 
ing roast. Score the edges of 
meat with a sharp knife and place 
on rack in open pan. Sear the 
meat well under gas flame. Re- 
duce heat when meat is crisp, 
season well and finish cooking 
in upper oven, basting meat often 
with fat in the pan. Turn flame 
out ten minutes before roast is 
done and make a gravy with four 
tablespoons each of meat fat and 
flour and a pint of stock (or boil- 
ing water). Season well, add 
Kitchen Bouquet to color and 
flavor, and strain before serving. 
Meat cooked in this fashion is 
more like the roast prepared over 
an open fire, and no such flavor or 
juiciness can be obtained by bak- 
ing in a wood or coal oven. 

GRAVY FOR .^.OAST MEAT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

If the liquid in the pan is mostly 
fat, as in beef, cooked without 
water, pour off all but two table- 
spoons of fat, stir in two table- 
spoons of dry flour apd when well 
mixed and brown, add one pint 



of boiling water; add salt, and 
strain after cooking eight minutes 
or till smooth. Scrape all glaze 
from pan into gravy as it gives 
fine flavor. If the pan contains 
mostly water, as with roast pork 
or poultry, dip off some of the fat, 
which by tipping pan will be on 
top, and stir in flour-and-water 
batte'r, mixed smooth; let it boil 
ten minutes, season and strain 
before serving. If you have let 
the water cook nearly out and it 
looks curdled, add more water and 
stir well as it boils. 

POT ROAST, BRAISED MEAT 
EN CASSEROLE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Suitable for large lean pieces of 
beef from round or rump, for 
shoulder of veal or mutton whole 
or in portions, for fowl,_ liver 
or any meat thaf has tough fibre 
and needs slow, gentle, moist heat 
to soften it, and also the rich 
flavor given by intense heat. 
Wipe, trim, try out some of the 
fat in kettle (for veal, use half salt 
pork or the kidney suet), brown 
sliced onions in fat, dredge meat 
with flour, brown it all over in the 
fat, add one cup water, cover 
tightly; cook slowly four to six

hours, or till very tender. Re- 
plenish with half cup of water 
when needed, season and thicken 
it for gravy. 

BAKED OR ROAST MEATS OR 

POULTRY 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Suitable for leg, loin, rib, or rump 
of beef, mutton, lamb or veal, 
and for poultry and game. 
Meat should have tender fibre, 
and if not, or if poultry be old, it 
is better to steam it a while first. 
Wipe, trim, rub with salt and 
flour. Sear the lean surface of 
meat in the hot baking pan over 
the fire to keep in juices. Put it 
skin side up in hot pan in hot 
oven, with fat trimmings beneath, 
without water. Watch carefully 
and when flour is brown, reduce 
the heat to about same as for 
bread. Use rack for level pieces 
if preferred, and for poultry; the 
ribs answer for rack in loin pieces. 
Roast beef, if to be rare, needs 
no water. To meats needing 
long cooking, like pork, veal and 
poultry, add it when the fat and 
flour • have begun to brown. 
Baste every ten minutes, less 
often for meat with thick fat on 
top, or for poultry covered with 
its own fat or greased paper. Do 
not 1st fat or flour bum. > Add 
water as needed. Cook a six 
pound loin or rib from one to one 
and one-half hours, a ten pound 
rump two hours, a ten pound 
turkey three hours. A fillet of 
beef, and dark-meated game, 
shotild be rare, and are cooked 
without water,- basted with fat 



pork or bacon laid on top. Cook 
twenty minutes to half an hour 
in very hot oven. 

FRIED MEAT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Small chops, cutlets of veal, 
portions of tripe, may be covered 
with bread crumbs, egg and 
crumbs, and Cooked in hot deep 
Cottolene, reducing heat after the 
first plunge, so they will not be 
too brown when done, or cook 
them in a little of their own fat 
in spider. 

BROILED StEAK 

(Miss Willis) 
Have your steak at least an inch 
and a half thick. Trim off the 
fat, leaving only a rim around the 
edge. Have the wire broiler 
greased well with suet and very 
hot. Lay the steak on and place 
exposed to a blaze that will 
quickly sear the surface without 
burning the fat. Then turn and 
sear the other side in the same 
manner. When this is done, turn 
again and broil about five min- 
utes with slightly reduced heat. 
Then turn and broil five minutes 
on other side. Have a heated 
platter ready with about a table- 
spoon of melted butter; lay the 
steak on this, season with salt 
and pepper, and pour a little 
melted butter over the surface. 
Serve very hot. When properly 
broiled the interior of the steak 
is pink and juicy. 

STEWED MEAT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Use bones and trimmings from 
roasts, or the tough parts of steaks 



34 



PURE [i-OOD RECIPES 



and chops, the legs, neck and 
■wings of poultry, or use any tough 
cheap portion of any kind of 
fresh meat, first browning some 
of the lean in the melted suet or 
fat of the meat with a sliced 
onion, to give the flavor of roast 
meat. Use onion and turnip cut 
small with all meats; celery or 
sweet pepper with poultry; par- 
snip with pork; parsley, rice and 
tomato with veal. 

Cover bones and tough parts 
with cold water to make a rich 
broth, bring to boiling point 
quickly, skim to improve appear- 
ance, then add the lean or tender 
and browned meat to keep those 
portions rich in juice;- simmer till 
bones are clean. Remove some 
of the fat and bones, add the 
vegetables, and twenty minutes 
before serving add sliced pota- 
toes, first scalding them to pre- 
vent their bitter juice from giv- 
ing the broth an unpleasant 
flavor. Thicken the water, sea- 
-son to taste, varying it for differ- 
ent meats. If desired, add ten 
minutes before serving, dumplings 
made with one pint flour, one-half 
level teaspoon salt, one rounded 
teaspoon baking powder, and 
moisten with milk to soft dough. 
Use no shortening if you wish 
them light; eggs are unnecessary. 
Drop the dough from a teaspoon 
into the boiling stew, letting them 
rest on meat or potato; or toss 
dough about till slightly floured, 
and cut with small cutter; keep 
covered tightly and cook just ten 
minutes. 



BARBECUED HAM 

(Miss Willis) 
Have cold boiled ham sliced 
somewhat thicker than for a cold 
service. Spread both sides of 
each slice lightly with mixed or 
made mustard. H^at butter in 
the chafing dish, and put in 
slices of the ham; turn frequently 
until nicely browned, then pour 
over the slices two tablespoons 
of rather sharp cider or vinegar; 
let boil up and serve with apple' 
rings, cooked^ in syrup of sugar 
and water until clear, but not 
broken. 

HAM AND BACON 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Ham for broiling should be cut 
very thin, and bacon should not 
be more than one-fourth inch 
thick; better one-eighth. Cook 
in broiler, turning often. Or lay 
broiler over a pan and cook in 
oven. Or, cook bacon in a hot 
pan over the fire, turning often 
and serve when crisp. Drain well. 
Fried ham is improved by slow 
cooking, first, in water in the 
spider for half an hour, then let 
water boil out and the ham cook 
till fat is browned. 

FRIED VEAL 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Use slices from rump, or loin, or 
ribs; remove bones, tendons and 
skin, cover them with cold water 
and stew for the gravy. Cook 
veal fat in spider till brown and 
crisp; ' pound and shape meat 
into pieces for serving, brown it in 
the fat, then cook more slowly 
till done — with no trace of pink 



MEAT, POULTRY AND GAME

color, for the veal should never be 
rare. Remove meat and crisp 
fat, add dry flour, brown it and 
reduce -with the boiling water 
from the bones. Season with salt , 
pepper, and lemon if you like, 
and serve as gravy. If lean meat 
from leg, or some tough part, 
has been used, put it in stewpan 
when browned, and pour gravy 
over it and let it simmer for half 
an hour. 

STUFFED LEG OF LAMB 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Prepare a dressing by moistening 
two cups of bread crumbs (from 
inside of the loaf) with one-half 
cup of melted butter. Season 
with salt, pepper and thyme, or 
sweet marjoram, with a little 
onion, if desired. Add a very 
little water and place in the meat, 
skewering the ends into shape. 
Have oven very hot and place 
meat in pan, adding no seasoning 
until the surface is seared over. 
Then reduce the gas flame, dredge 
meat lightly with flour and the 
seasonings and baste the meat 
every ten or fifteen minutes (un- 
less a covered roasting pan is 
used), and roast about an hour 
and a half, if weighing five pounds. 
Serve with a brown sauce made 
from four tablespoons of flour and 
the drippings in the pan, with a 
pint of stock made by cooking the 
bones in water very slowly until 
it is well flavored. 

SAUSAGE^ 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Cook roll sausage whole in pan in 
the oven, dredge with flour and 



baste often. Cook twp pound 
roll two hours. Serve hot or cold. 
Sausage cakes or links, cook ih 
pan in the oven. 

BEEF LOAF 

(Miss W^HUs) 

Four pounds lean' beef chopped 
flne; one-half pound uncooked 
ham also chopped fine, one-half 
cup stale bread crumbs, one tea- 
spoon salt, one teaspoon onion

half teaspdon cloves, grating of 
nutmeg and one tablespoon chop- 
ped parsley. Mix thoroughly and

BEEF PIE WITH POTATO 
CRUST 

(Miss Willis) 
Boil five large potatoes in salted 
water. When done slice a layer 
into a buttered baking dish, then 
put in a layer of cold roast or 
boiled beef or mutton, season 
with salt, pepper and celery salt, 
add a little stewed or raw tomato 
if you have any left over. Then 
add another layer of potatoes, 
meat, etc., until dish is full. 
Reserve enough potato to make 
a cupfid when mashed. To these 
add one tablespoon Cottolene, 
and when cool, one well beaten 
egg and whip until light. Then 
work in enough flour — from one- 
half to one cup — mixed with 
one-half teaspoon salt and one

teaspoon baking powder to make 
a crust that will roll out into a thin 
sheet. Make a gravy from scraps 
of meat and bones and any left 
over gravy and pour into the dish. 
Cut slit in top of the crust for the 
escape of steam, and bake in a 
quick oven about thirty minutes. 
Add a little onion to pie if you 
wish. 

CALF'S LIVER WITH CREAM 
GRAVY 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Slice the liver one-third inch 
thick, scald and strip off the skin 
on edges, or snip it several times 
to prevent slices from curling. 
Drain and cook till brown in hot 
Cottolene, being careful not to 
,bum it. Put the liver in a stew- 
pan, and cook two sliced onions 
in more Cottolene till yellow; add 
to the liver, pour in cream to 
cover, and simmer ten minutes, 
closely covered. Add salt and 
pepper to taste. 

NEW ENGLAND BOILED 
DINNER 

(Miss WiUis) 

Remove the bone from a compact 
cut of the round of corned beef 
weighing about eight pounds, and 
tie the meat as clos^y as possible; 
put it in a deep pot, cover it with 
cold water, add a teaspoon of salt 
and half a saltspoon of pepper; 
let it boil quickly, removing all 
scum; when no more scum rises, 
put with it the following vege- 
tables, peeled and cut in slices 
two inches thick. Two carrots, 
four beets, four white turnips, and 



one yellow turnip, six small onions 
peeled so that they will remain 
unbroken, and a large head of 
celery cut in two-inch lengths. 
Place the pot where its contents 
will simmer slowly for two hours. . 
A glass of wine or any table sauce 
preferred, may be added before 
the dish is finished. To serve it, 
put the meat in the middle of a 
platter, arrange the vegetables 
around it, and pour a little of 
the grav^ over it. More of the 
gravy should be served in a small 
boat, with a dish of boiled pota- 
toes. The united flavor of the 
meat and vegetables characterizes ~ 
the dish. The beets may be 
boiled separately, without break- 
ing the skin, if they are so pre- 
ferred. 

MEAT PIES 

(Miss Willis) 

For the crust 
One pint flour, four tablespoons 
Cottolene, one teaspoon salt, one 
tablespoon sugar, two teaspoons 
baking powder, one generous gill 
water. 

Mix and roll the same as for 
pie crust, except that this crust is 
to be rolled only twice instead of 
four times. 

For the rest of the pie 
Take three pints of any kind of 
cold cooked meat, one quart 
water or stock (the water in which 
the bones have been boiled), two 
tablespoons butter, one table- 
spoon minced onion, one table- 
spoon minced carrot, three table- 
spoons^ flour, two teaspoons salt, 
and one-third teaspoon pepper. 



MEAT. POULTRY AND GAME

Cook the butter, carrot and 
onion together for ten minutes, 
take the vegetables from the 
butter and put them in a stewpan 
with the meat. Into the butter 
remaining in the pan put one 
tablespoon of the flour, and stir 
until smooth and frothy. Grad- 
ually add the stock or water to 
this, stirring all the time. Cook 
for five minutes, then pour upon 
the meat, and set the stewpan on 
the fire. Mix the remaining two 
tablespoons of flour with half a 
gill of cold water and stir into the 
pan containing the meat and 
gravy. Add the salt and pepper, 
and cook for fifteen minutes; 
then proceed as for chicken pie. 

BOILED OR STEAMED TURKEY 

OR FOWL 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Clean; rub well with pepper and 
lemon juice, and stuff with oysters 
or bread stuffing. It is better 
without the stuffing, as the oys- 
ters are usually overdone, and 
the same flavor may be obtained 
from an oyster sauce served with 
the turkey. Truss the legs and 
wings close to the body; pin the 
fowl in a cloth to keep it whiter 
and preserve the shape. Put 
into boiling salted water. Allow 
twenty minutes to the poutjd. 
Cook slowly till tender, but not 
long enough for it to fall apart. 
Turkeys are much nicer steamed 
than boiled. Serve with oyster, 
celery or ^mon sauce. Garnish 
with a border of boiled rice or 
macaroni, and pour part of the 
sauce over the fowl. 



Fowls are sometimes stuffed 
with boiled celery, cut into pieces 
an inch long; or with macaroni 
which has been boiled and sea- 
soned with salt and pepper. 

GRAVY FOR ROAST POULTRY 
AND GAME 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Put the giblets, or neck, liver, 
gizzard and heart, on to boil in 
one quart of water and boil till 
tender, and the water reduced to ' 
one pint. Mash the liver, and if 
desired, chop the gizzard, heart 
and meat from the neck. Pour 
off the clear fat from the dripping- 
pan, and put the settlings into a 
saucepan, rinse out the pan with 
the water in which the giblets 
were boiled, and pour this water, 
into the saucepan and put on to 
boil. ' Put three or four table- 
spoons of the fat into a small fry- 
ing pan, add enough dry flour to, 
absorb all the fat, and when brown 
add the giblet liquid gradually, 
and stir, till it thickens, fatason 
with salt and pepper. If not 
smooth, strain it, pour half of it 
into the gravy boat, and add the 
chopped giblets to the remaining 
half,' and serve separately, as all 
may not care for the giblet gravy.

alternate layers. Return the 
bones to the broth with the gristle 
but not the skin, and let simmer 
until broth is reduced to about a 
cupful. A few slices of carrot 
and onion, a stalk or root of celery 
and leaves of parsley, bay or 
sweet majoram or savory may be 
cooked in the broth, then strained 
out. Season With salt and pep- 
per, allowing for meat- as well as 
broth; pour the broth over the 
meat, let it stand a short time to 
settle down through the meat, 
then cover meat with a board 
bearing a weight and let stand in 
a cold place over night. If meat 
is cut in dice it makes a prettier 



mold. The mold may be lined 
with sliced, hard-boiled eggs, and 
olives, if you want a "company" 
dish.

Frying — Immersing food in an ample quantity of fat so hot that the 
instant the food is in it the outer surface "is crisped, its absorbent prop- 
erties destroyed, its juices and flavors all retained, and it is thoroughly 
cooked, while its outer surface is brown and dry, is what is truly meant 
by "frying, ' ' and the product of this mode of frying is something deli- 
cious to the epicure and wholesome for those who live plainly. 

For frying, therefore, yo-u, must have your Cottolene very hot he- 
jore the food is put in. Always test before you begin to cook your food. 
Neither must you put too much food in at one time, or the Cottolene 
will cool and your frying will be retarded and injured in quality. Put 
it on in a cold pan and allow it to heat gradually; it will not sputter 
nor smoke and reaches a cooking temperature quicker than lard. Drop 
into the Cottolene a piece of bread ; if it browns in half a minute it is 
ready for use. It is unequaled for frying doughnuts, fritters, vege- 
tables, fish, oysters and croquettes; test by dropping in a piece of 
dough. If it rises at once the fat is hot enough. Follow the direc- 
tions about having it very hot, and your food will come out dry, crisp, 
brown and delicate — no grease, no odor and no dyspepsia.

SCALLOPED MEAT, FISH, OY- 
STERS, ETC. 

(Mrs, Lincoln) 
Allow one cup of sauce, one cup 
cracker crumbs moistened in one- 
fourth cup Cottolene, for two cups 
of meat or fish or any of the mix- 
tures given below. Line the 
deep baking dish with one-fourth 
of the crumbs, add a layer of mix- 
ture, a layer of sauce, one-fourth 
of crumbs, another layer of each 
and cover with the remaining 
half of the crumbs. Bake till 
crumbs are brown. Oysters may 
be used alone, with their juice 
and the crumbs. Some of the 
favorite combinations are as fol- 
lows: 

Mutton : Oysters, macaroni, 
and white or tomato sauce. 

Chicken: Rice, oysters or cel- 
ery, and white sauce. ' 

Beef: Onions, diced potatoes 
and brown gravy or sauce. 

Veal : StuflSng, rice, turnip and 
tomato sauce. 

Ham: Mustard, hard eggs, 
white sauce. 

Fish : Onions, pickles, tomato 
sauce. 

Oysters: Celery, bacon and 
white sauce. 
(See pages 41 to 43 for sauces) 

In this, as in all warmed-over 
dishes of meat or fish, discard 
anything uneatable, and cut 
meat in half -inch bits ; if very 
tough stew it first, for the oven 
cooking will not always make 
it tender. 



SPANISH HASH 

(Miss Willis) 

Chop together four cold pota- 
toes, two small onions and one 
green pepper ; then add one cup 
cold roast meat (any kind) and 
one cup canned tomatoes. Season 
with pepper and salt and three 
drops of tabasco sauce ; add one 
egg well beaten. Drop mixture 
by spoonful into muffin pans. 
Bake in hot oven and serve with 
tomato sauce. 



CROQUETTES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Chop fine any kind of cooked 
meat or fish. If short of material, 
add mashed potatoes, or rice, to 
beef, mutton or fish; - and to 
chicken, fish, oysters, or veal, 
add soft bread crumbs, or rice. 
Moisten light meats with thick 
white sauce (see page 42), equal 
amount, and dark meats with 
tomato (see page 43), or brown 
sauce (see page 42), made quite 
thick. Season with salt and 
pepper and onion juice if liked. 
When very cold, shape the mix- 
ture into balls or cylinders; roll 
first in sifted bread crumbs, then 
beaten egg diluted with one table- . 
spoon milk, then crumbs again. 
Fry one minute in deep Cottolene, 
hot enough to brown a bit of bread 
while you count forty. Use a 
basket, and cook only four at a 
time. Drain on paper, and be 
sure that the fat is hot for each 
frying. Serve plain, or with 
sauce like that in the mixture, 
only thinner.

MACARONI CROQUETTES 

(Miss WilUs) 

Break onei-fourth pound macaroni 
into one-half inch pieces and boil 
rapidly in plenty of boiling §alted 
water for about twenty-five min- 
utes or until tender, then throw 
into cold water for five minutes 
to blanch. Scald one cup milk 
in double boiler. Rub together 
two tablespoons Cottolene and 
four of flour and add to the milk 
and stir until it thickens. Add 
the yolk of one egg ; stir a minute 
and then remove from the fire 
and add one tablespoon Parmesan 
cheese, salt and cayenne to taste. 
Mix and let get perfectly cold. 
Then form into croquettes, cylin- 
der shape, dip in beaten egg and 
bread crumbs and fry in deep hot 
Cottolene until a nice brown. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 

Make a sauce with four table- 
spoons of butter, six of flour and 
one cup milk, season with salt, 
pepper, parsley and lemon juice. 
Add one pint cut chicken, spread 



on platter to cool. When cool, 
'shape into cutlets or croquettes, 
roll in bread crumbs, beaten eggs 
and crumbs again and fry in hot 
fat, preferably Cottolene. Serve 
with Bechamel or mushroom sauce 
or French peas. 

Mushroom sauce is made by 
adding one tablespoon of lemon 
juice to one cup cream sauce and 
one-half cup cooked mushrooms 
cut in piece^s, or brown sauce may 
be used instead of white. 

Bechamel sauce is made like 
white sauce, with clear stock and 
cream instead of milk, and is 
highly seasoned. One whole egg 
or two beaten yolks are added 
just before serving. , 

RICE CROQUETTES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Season hot boiled rice, cooked 
very soft, with salt, pepper, butter 
and grated cheese; and to one 
pint of rice, add yolks two eggs 
weir beaten. Mix well and shape 
when cool in balls , or ovals. 
Qrumb-egg-and-crumb, and fry 
as usual.

The juices that flow from rare cooked meats are the best sauce for 
them; but do not try to make them go farther by pouring hot water 
over the meat as it is carved. A steak cooked to a turn needs only 
salt ; it may have butter if it has but little fat ; lamb chops need only 
salt, but many like to add a little lenion juice, or minced parsley, or 
tomato sauce, to both meats, and also to many other broiled meats, 
like chicken, tripe, etc. Apple sauce should be served with pork,, 
duck and goose; cranberry sauce seems to belong to turkey and roast

chicken. Oily fish broiled needs but little butter, but salt and lemon 
juice may be used generously. White fish, like halibut, cod, etc., 
needs rich white sauce flavored with egg, lemon and onion. \ 

There is a common philosophy in making sauces. Remember 
that two level tablespoons of butter or Cottolene mixed with two level 
tablespoons of flour will thicken each half pint of liquid. 

For a white sauce rub the fat and flour together and add' a half 
pint of milk; stir until boiling. 

For a tomato sauce rub the fat and flour together and add a half 
pint of nicely seasoned strained tomatoes. 

For a brown sauce, use half a pint of stock. 

For English drawn butter, rub the fat and flour together and add a 
half pint of boiling water; stir until boiling, then add a .seasoning of 
salt and pepper and stir in, at last, an extra tablespoon of butter. . 

The seasonings, of course, will vary, but each sauce will require 
a saltspoon of pepper and half teaspoon of salt. By remembering 
the proportions one may make a dozen sauces in a very few minutes 
and have them all smooth and palatable. 



WHITE SAUCE 

For White Meats, and Soups, Fish, 

Vegetables, Eggs, Toast, or 

Puddings 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

In a granite saucepan, ./melt and 
mix one rounded tablespoon each 
of butter or Cottolene and flour, 
and from one-fourth to one-half 
level teaspoon salt. Add grad- 
ually one cup of hot water, or 
milk, or cream, or stock from 
oysters, whitefish, or meats. Stir 
till smooth. 

For Toast 
Nothing more is needed, but dip 
toast in hot milk if liked soft. 

For Meat and Fish 
Add lemon juice, cayenne, capers, 
bits of oysters, lobsters, or cooked 
celery, and a few drops of onion 
juice; or cook one rounded tea- 
spoon minced onion, or celery, or 
green pepper, or bit of bay leaf. 



in the butter before adding flour. 

For Vegetables 
Add pepper, or minced sweet 
pepper, or parsley, and to cauli- 
flower, and a few others, add 
grated cheese, or lemon juice. 

For White Soups 
Add a bit of bay leaf, one-fourth 
teaspoon mixed whole spice or 
parsley, one rounded tablespoon 
onion, or sweet pepper, or grated 
carrot. 
For Picked-up Codfish or Chipped 

Beef 
Make the plain white sauce 
(above) with milk, and add one 
beaten egg just before serving. 

FOR RICH WHITE SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Use cream or rich white stock 
(make as per white sauce) and 
just before serving stir in one, 
beaten egg yolk, or two hard 
boiled eggs chopped or sifted.

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



FOR THICK WHITE SAUCE, 

CROQUETTES, ETC. 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Make as for white sauce, but 
•double the flour; or use cream 
with one level tablespoon butter, 
and one heaped tablespoon corn- 
starch. 

FOR PUDDING SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Make white sauce (see page 41) 
using one and one-half cups of 
■hot water, add when smooth one 
•and one-half cups of brown, or 
maple, or"granvdated sugar; fla- 
vor with one tablespoon lemon 
juice, or vinegar, or wine, or a 
little spice, and just before serv- 
ing stir in another rounded table- 
spoon of butter and yolk of one 
•egg, if you wish it richer. 

BRO^N SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
We call this brown gravy when 
•made in the roasting pan from 
"the fat or dripping of meat with 
simple seasoning of salt and pep- 
per; and brown sauce when we 
make it in a frying pan with 
butter and brown stock, and sea- 
son highly. But the principle 
is the same, and the way to avoid 
"the pale, greasy, or curdled mix- 
"ture so often served, is to use the 
Tight proportions of flour and fat 
■and cook them till well browned , 
before adding the liquid. You 
cannot brown flour ' and water, 
until most of the water is boiled 
■out, but you can brown flour and 
fat very quickly; and flour will 
only absorb about its bulk of fat. 
For gravy, make it as direcljed 
under Roast Meat. 



For special dishes, when the 
baking pan has not furnished the 
starting point of glaze and 
browned ^fat, melt in an iron pan 
one rounded tablespoon of butter, 
or Cottolene, or any fat of meat 
you are preparing ; let it brown, 
add one rounded tablespoon flour 
or cornstarch, stir till very brown 
(it will be lighter when wet), 
add gradually one cup of hot 
stock (th^at made from stewing 
trimmings of meat you are cook- 
ing will answer, instead of using 
nice cleared stock prepared for 
soup). Add more hot water if 
too thick, boil down if too thin; 
season with salt, pepper and lemon 
juice, and add mushrooms, catsup, 
horseradish, currant jelly, or any 
other condiment which will, blend 
with the meat. The main points 
are to have it brown, smooth,' 
free from grease, and savory. 

HORSERADISH SAUCE 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Put a half pint of milk or cream 
in a double boiler. Rub together 
a tablespoon of Cottolene and an 
even tablespoon of flour; then 
stir them into the boiling milk, 
add one ounce of young horse- 
radish, finely grated, a half tea- 
spoon of salt and a half teaspoon 
of sugar. This is exceedingly 
nice to serve with boiled, fresh or 
salt meat. 

PARSLEY BUTTER 

(Miss Willis) 
Beat three tablespoons butter or 
two of Cottolene to a cream, then 
add one tablespoon lemon juice, 
one tablespoon minced parsley. 



VEGETABLES 



43 



one-half teaspoon salt. Beat all 
the ingredients into the butter 
and it is ready to use. If in- 
tended for potato balls, use less 
lemon juice. 

TOMATO SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
For Chops, Fish, Macaroni, etc. 
Cook one rounded tablespoon 
minced onion in one tablespoon 
Cottolene till only slightly col- 
ored; add, if liked, the same 
amount of minced sweet pepper, 
celery or parsley, carrot or turnip ; 
stir in one rounded tablespoon 



flour, and one^fourth level tea- 
spoon salt; add gradually from 
one to one and one-half cups- 
strained hot tomato, or any left- 
over stewed tomato if unsweet- 
ened. Strain before serving, if 
desired smooth. This is espec- 
ially suitable for veal chops, fish,, 
macaroni and many dishes of 
left-overs. 



Mrs. Helen Armstrongr, Teacher of Cook- 
ery, says: "Haying used Cottolene con- 
stantly for over five years, both as 
shortening; and for frying purposes, 1 feel 
no hesitancy in recommending it as a very 
superior article. It is not only much more 
vtrholesome than lard, but produces more 
palatable results." 



Meats carefully cooked are, no doubt, more easily digested than some 
vegetables, but, on the other hand, vegetables are clean and wholesome. 
Vegetable foods are concentrated and slow of digestion; hence, the 
vegetarian eats but two meals a day, and on these two meals, if his 
diet is well selected, he receives more nourishment than the meat 
eater from his three meals a day. In selecting a vegetarian diet, choose 
nitrogenous vegetables to take the place of meat; with a meat diet 
select green and starchy vegetables to fill in the vacancies of a nitrog- 
enous diet. With beef we serve potatoes. With poultry, rice, or (in 
chestnut season) boiled chestnuts or macaroni, or hominy or white 
bread. 

All green vegetables are put on to cook in boiling water. Add 
salt to the water in which green or top ground vegetables are cooked; 
white or underground vegetables are better when the salt is added 
after the cooking. Wash rice through one or two watery before boiling. 

Soak dried fruits over night. 

Cabbage, cauliflower, onions and turnips, vegetables containing 
volatile oil, must be boiled rapidly in an uncovered vessel, or they will 
emit unpleasant odors. 

Medium sized onions should be boiled in salt water one hour. 

Green com in salted water five minutes. 

Peas in salted water twenty minutes. 

Asparagus in salted water thirty minutes.

TOMATOES, STEWED 

(Mrs Lincoln) 
Peel, cut small, cook quickly, 
chopping as they cook ; when soft 
and no distinct bits of pulp vis- 
ible, add one-fourth cup sugar, 
(unless preferred not sweet) two 
tablespoons butter, one-half tea- 
spoon salt, and one-eighth tea- 
spoon pepper Add also a slice 
of onion, or green pepper, if liked. 
Cook five minutes longer and 
serve hot. 

GREEN PEAS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Shell, rinse quickly, cook in 
small amount of boiling water, 
letting it nearly boil out before 
serving; season as for beans, or 
with white sauce. (Seepage 41.)

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



Canned Peas. Turn into 
strainer, rinse in several waters 
to remove can water, heat quickly 
in saucepan, season as for fresh 
peas. 

STRING BEANS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Use fresh, tender, yellow or green 
beans. Remove strings and ends, 
cut in slanting slivers; to one pint 
of beans, put into a stew-pan one 
level tablespoon butter, one-half 
level teaspoon salt, a dash of nut- 
meg, and pepper; add beans, 
lifting them from the pan with 
only the , water that clings to 
them; cover tightly, and cook 
very, very slowly, about one hour, 
or till tender. Their own juice, 
with just heat enough to tumjt 
into steam, will cook them ; but, 
if cooked too fast, and they begin 
to sizzle, add one or two table- 
spoons of water. Turn out when 
tender with no further seasoning. 

GREEN OR SHELLED BEANS 

(Mis. Lincoln) 
Shell, wash, cook in boiling water 
five minutes, pour off, adding 
first, to the strong varieties that 
turn dark in cooking, one-fourth 
teaspoon soda; rinse, add more 
boiling water, and cook until 
soft, adding water as needed to 
have enough left to moisten well. 
Mash a few and season with salt, 
a bit of sugar, pepper and one 
tablespoon butter; and stir this 
into the water, boil for a moment 
1 and serve. 

No. 2. Add to the cooked 
beans an equal amount of raw or 
boiled sweet com scraped from 



cob, season in proportion, cook 
five minutes, and serve as succo- 
tash. 

Dried Lima or other Beans: 
Soak twelve hours in cold water; 
slip off the skin if it comes off 
easily, then cook the same as 
fresh beans till tender, and season. 

BAKED BEANS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

The noon before, pick over and 
soak one quart of pea beans 
(small white) in cold water. Next 
morning add fresh water and let 
them simmer (not boil) till 
slightly soft but not broken. 
Skim them out into an earthen 
pot having bulging sides, a 
narrow top and a cover. Cut one 
onion in quarters, and put por- 
tions of it in with the beans. 
Cut rind of one pound of fat salt 
pork (with a streak of lean) 
down for one inch — and, a half 
inch apart, imbed it with the 
beans, leaving the rind up. Mix 
one level teaspoon each of 
mustard, salt and brown sugar, 
and two tablespoons of molasses, 
fill the cup with boiling water, 
pour it over the beans, add 
enough more to fill the pot. 
Bake slowly six to eight or ten 
hours. As water boils out add 
more, then when out again, let 
the beans cook until you hear 
them sizzle; this will indicate 
that water is low, and the fat is 
beginning to cook on the edge of 
the pot. Let it do so for a while, 
for this gives a rich color and 
flavor, better than that obtained 
by an excess of molasses, and

hardens the beans slightly, so 
they will not be mushy, although 
soft. Then lift the pork up on 
top and add water just to show 
above the beans, and keep it so 
during the remainder of the 
baking. 

These specific directions are 
for the benefit of persons outside 
of New England, who seldom 
find or prepare beans as they are 
served in that land where they 
have an honored place on many 
tables. If you do not care to use 
pork, use Cottolene — one-half 
cup, or fat corned beef. 

When warmipg them over, 
melt some of the pork in a small 
pan, add the beans and let them 
cook, without stirring, till warm 
or slightly browned; or brown 
them in Cottolene. These are 
more palatable than when 
warmed in water, unless you wish 
to make bean puree or soup. 
This we learn from the Mexican 
way of cooking beans. 

GREEKS, SPINACH, ETC. 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Pick over, trim, wash in five 
waters, drain, put into kettle 
with water that drips from them; 
cook slowly at first till juice is 
drawn out; then quickly till 
tender; drain, rinse if you dislike 
the strong flavor, chop, reheat, 
season with butter, salt and pep- 
per; add cream if you like, or 
serve with lemon or vinegar. If 
for a course, garnish with hard, 
boiled eggs; or serve cold as a 
salad. 



RED CABBAGE, ONIONS, SUM- 
MER CARROTS 

(Mrs. Lihcoln) 

Cut either of these vegetables into 
slivers and cook the same as string 
beans using a bit of onion in 
place of nutmeg with the red 
cabbage, and adding one teaspoon 
vinegar just before serving. To 
the carrots, add one-half teaspoon 
sugar, and one teaspoon lemon 
juice; and to the onion, add a 
little milk or cream. 

BEETS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Wash with care not to break skin 
and make them bleed. Cook in 
boiling water till tender, about 
one hour. Plunge into cold water 
and rub off skins. Chop coarsely, 
heat again, season with butter, 
salt and pepper; or slice thin and 
cover with vinegar. Butter will 
not blend easily with beets unless 
they are chopped. Winter beets 
require three hours' cooking. 

PARSNIPS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Scrub, scrape or pare, divide 
lengthwise in quarters, cut off 
from the sharp edge all the woody 
fibre which runs through the 
center; slice in half -inch bits, and 
cook quickly in boiling water, 
about fifteen minutes or till soft. 
Drain, mash with a four-pronged 
fork to break up all the fibre; 
add salt, pepper and butter and 
serve plain ; or shape in flat cakes, 
flour slightly, and brown in a 
little hot Cottolene. By remov- 
ing the pithy center the parsnips 
are more easily digested.

TURNIPS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Slice half inch thick, pare, cut 
again in cubes, cook in boiling 
water till soft, drain, serve in 
white sauce (see page 41), or 
mash and season generously with 
salt, and with butter and pepper. 

CREAICES CABBAGE 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Chop sufficient cabbage to make 
two quarts. Cover it with cold 
water, soak one hour, drain, cover 
with boiling water, add a tea- 
spoon of salt, boil in an uncovered 
saucepan twenty minutes, drain 
again. Rub together one table- 
spoon of butter and one of flour, 
add a half pint of milk, stir until 
boiling, add a teaspoon of salt, a 
saltspoon of pepper; add the 
cabbage, heat carefiilly and serve. 
Excellent. 

CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Trim oS the outside leaves of a 
nice, fresh cauliflower, tie it up 
in a piece of cheese cloth, and put 
it into well-salted boiling water; . 



boil for twenty or thirty minutes. 
Be careful to take it out as soon 
as tender, or it will fall into pieces. 
Drain and separate the head into 
the little flowerets. Put in bak- 
ing dish, pour over cream sauce, 
sprinkle thickly with grated cheese 
and brown in a quick oven. 

ASPARAGUS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Wash, trim off tough ends, tie 
in bundle, cook in boiling slightly 
salted water, twenty minutes or 
till tender. Moisten toast with 
the water, spread with butter, 
lay a few stalks on each slice, add 
butter and salt and serve hot as a 
course; or as the main part of a 
meal when you do not wish meat. 

No. 2. (3ook only about three 
inches of the tip and serve cold 
as a salad. Cut the remainder 
into inch bits, boil, mash, sift and 
use for cream soup. 

Celery (the outer stalks divided 
once), cucumbers (pared and 
quartered lengthwise), leeks (free 
from tips and rootlets) may each 
be cooked, seasoned and served in 
the same way as asparagus. 



For the family in moderate circumstances, or the woman who does all 
the work of the house, it is unwise to have soup every day, for it makes 
unnecessary labor in changing for so many courses, and compels some 
one to look out that the next course is served hot. Better utilize the 
usual soup material in a stew, or some kind of made-over dish, which 
may serve as the chief dish of the meal. When dinner is served at 
noon, broths and soups may be served at the supper, giving the warmth 
and stimulation often desired but too often supplied by a second or

third meal of hearty meat. They are equally good for breakfast, 
especially for children who do not usually take the liquid food needed 
then, which others have in coffee, etc. 



VEGETABLE CREAM SOUPS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Prepare the vegetable; cook po- 
tatoes, cauliflower or artichokes 
in boiling water and discard water ; 
cook others in cold water, let it 
cook nearly all out; mash, press 
through sieve, add white sauce 
(one cup to each pint of pulp and 
water for most fresh green vege- 
tables, also for canned vegetables; 
and one pint of sauce for each 
pint of pulp from spinach, toma- 
toes and other succulent vege- 
tables). Season with salt and 
pepper; dilute with hot milk if 
too thick; add beaten egg, or 
more pulp if too thin. Serve 
with toasted crackers. 

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP 

(Miss Willis) 

One quart chicken or veal broth, 
one quart milk, one-half cup rice, 
one teaspoon salt, one head 
celery, seasoning. 

Use for this soup a quart of 
chicken or veal broth and about 
a quart of milk; pick over and 
wash the rice, rinse it well in cold 
water, and put it in a thick sauce- 
pan over the fire, with a pint of 
milk and a teaspoon of salt; 
wash a head of celery and grate 
the white stalks, letting the grated 
celery fall into milk enough to 
cover it, put the grated celery 
with the rice, and gently simmer 
them together until the rice is 
tender enough to rub through a 



sieve with a potato masher, add- 
ing more milk if the rice absorbs 
what has first been put with it. 
After the rice has been rubbed 
through the sieve, return it to the 
saucepan, place it again over the 
fire, and gradually stir with it the 
quart of stock or broth; if this 
quantity of stock does not dilute 
the soup to a creamy consistency, ' 
add a little milk; let the soup get 
scalding hot, -season it palatably 
with salt, white pepper, and a 
very little grated nutmeg, and 
serve at once. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

One quart milk, one pint canned 
tomatoes, or one pint stewed 
tomatoes, three teaspoons Cotto- 
lene, one bay leaf, sprig of parsley, 
blade of mace, one teaspoon sugar, 
one-quarter teaspoon baking soda, 
two tablespoons fiour. 

Put the tomatoes on to stew 
with the bay leaf, parsley and 
mace; let them stew fifteen 
minutes. Put the milk on to beil

CREAM SOUPS WITH STOCK 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
For each pint of water in which 
chicken, veal, or fish have been 
boiled, or of pulp of vegetables, 
allow one cup of thick white 
sauce made with cream. Com- 
bine, season, and serve plain, or 
with sifted egg yolk, minced 
parsley, or pepper, or the chief 
ingredient of the soup — like 
minced white meat in chicken 
soup, or oysters parboiled and 
rubbed through sieve for that 
soup. 

CONSOMMll 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Four pounds of beef, one ounce 
suet, one small onion, three 
quarts cold water, four Cloves, 
one small carrot, a piece of celery, 
one egg white. 

Cut into dice four pounds of 
lean beef from the round; put 
about one ounce of suet and one 
small onion — sliced, into the soup 
kettle and cook until a good 
brown; then add the meat, 
cook without covering thirty 
minutes; add the cold water, 
cover the kettle and simmer gent- 
ly for about three hours; at the 
end of this tinie add the cloves, 
carrots, a piece of celery, and 
simmer one hour longer. Strain 
and stand away to cool. When 
cold, remove all grease from the 
surface. Turn the consomm^ in- 
to a kettle ; beat the white of an 



egg with a half cup of cold water, 
add it to the boiling consomme, 
boil one minute and strain through 
cheese cloth. Season, and it is 
ready to serve. If wanted dark, 
add a teaspoon of caramel. 

NOODI-E SOUP 

(Miss Willis) 

One large egg, generous one-half 
cup flour, two quarts boiling 
water, three pints milk, three 
tablespoons flour, onion, mace, ' 
salt and pepper. 

To make the noodles, break the 
egg into a bowl and beat into it a 
little more than half a cup of 
flour and one-fourth of a teaspoon 
of salt. Now work this dough 
with the hands until it bepomes 
smooth and like putty. Sprinkle 
a molding-board with flour, and 
roll the dough as thin as possible. 
It should be like a wafer. Let it 
lie upon the board for five min- 
utes, then roll it up loosely, and 
with a sharp knife cut into slices 
about one-third of an inch thick. 
Spread these little pieces on the 
board, and let them dry for half 
an hour or more. Put on the 
stove a large saucepan contain- 
ing two quarts of boiling water. 
Add a tablespoon of salt, and, 
after turning the noodles into the 
water, cook them rapidly for 
twenty-five minutes. Turn into 
a colander and drain. 

To make the soup, use three 
pints of milk, three tablespoons 
of flour, one slice of onion, a bit 
of mace, two teaspoons of salt, 
and one-third of a teaspoon of 
pepper. 



SALADS. SANDWICHES, ETC.

Reserve half a cup of milk, and 
put the rest, with the onion and 
mace, on the stove in a double 
boiler. Mix the flour and cold 
milk, and stir the mixture into the 
boiling milk. Add the salt and 
pepper, and cook for fifteen min- 
utes. At the end of that time 
take out the mace and onion and 
add the noodles. Five minutes' 
cooking will complete the work. 

POTATO CHOWDER 

(Miss Willis) 
Peel and cut in dice five good 
sized potatoes. Throw into cold 
water. Cut quarter of a pound 
of ham in shreds and chop a 
medium sized onion coarsely. 
Pry ham and onion together until 



nicely browned. Mince a table- 
spoon of parsley. Drain water 
from the potatoes and put in a 
layer of potato dice in the bottom 
of a stewing kettle, then a sprinkle 
of the ham, onion and parsley. 
Then more potato dice, and so on 
until all is used. Cover with cold 
water and let come slowly to boil- 
ing point. Cook until the pota- 
toes are tender but not done 
enough to lose their shape. Add 
a pint of good, rich milk and sea- 
son to taste with salt and pepper. 
Rub to a smooth paste two level 
tablespoons of butter and two 
of flour. When the chowder 
boils up, stir in the thickening 
and continue to stir gently until 
it boils again, then serve at once. 



Salads^ Sandwicliei 



Serve a portion of fresh green vegetable, or ripe fruit, with every 
dinner if possible and dress it simply, always in this order (for if lettuce 
is wet first with the acid, the oil will not adhere) ; with salt to make it 
savory; pepper or other spice to make it bright ; oil, cream or butter, 
to make it smooth and more nutritious, by suppljring the fatty element 
lacking in the vegetable; and lemon juice or vinegar to give piquancy 
to the combination. Many like to add a bit of sugar to lessen the 
acidity. 

Fruit salads may precede a dinner or luncheon in warm weather, 
or follow as a dessert at any time; or be served with supper. When 
they are served first, they are dressed with sugar. 



SALAD VEGETABLES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Celery, cucumbers, lettuce, rad- 
ishes. To prepare the uncooked 
vegetables for salad, pick over. 



discard bruised portions, look 
out for insects by washing each 
leaf or stalk thoroughly, drain and 
pile in order on a wet towel, tie

will be cold; they will keep crisp 
for several days. Do not scrape 
celery till ready for the table. 
Pare cucumbers and let them 
stand in ice-water half an hour. 
Or, pare, but slice just before 
serving. Put the whole pared 
cucumber on a shallow dish, 
cut in very thin and even slices, 
but keep them together as if 
whole, and pour French dressing 
over them. Or let each person 
dress them to his own liking. 

Arrange lettuce in a deep bowl, 
large dark leaves outside, and so 
on, with the light colored and 
small ones in center, as if half 
opened. Celery looks best in an 
upright glass with its delicate 
tips opening out like a flower. 
The poorer stalks may be cut in 
three inch lengths. With radishes, 
cut skin in petal-like divisions. 

TOMATO SALAD 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Scald and peel large ripe toma- 
tees, cut in halves or slices and 
serve very cold; to be dressed to 
taste. Or scoop out the centers, 
making cups to be filled with the 
scooped-out portion, mixed with 
dice of cucumber, celery, or sweet 
pepper , nuts or cheese , and dressed ; 
or, cut the firm pulp, from the 
bottom part way down to the 
stem, in petal-shaped strips, turn, 
them partly back like an opened 
tulip and serve in a lettuce cup. 
Use any dressing you prefer, from 
your own estimate of sugar, salt, 
pepper and lemon, on through 
the French, the boiled and the 
sour cream dressings to the rich 



mayonnaise. They are all good, 
and blend perfectly with the 
tomato. When fresh tomatoes 
are not at hand, use the canned. 

POTATO SALAD 

(Miss Willis) 
Scrub small new potatoes, or 
smallest of old ones of the waxy 
variety. Boil them tender but 
not long enough to break easily. 
Peel while hot and cut in dice and 
mix with an equal amount of 
cucumber dice. Dress with little 
oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and 
onion juice and let stand fifteen 
minutes. Then mix with a boiled 
or bottled salad dressing, turn into 
a , dish lined with lettuce and 
sprinkle minced paVsley over the 
top and serve. 

LETTUCE WITH PLAIN CREAM 
DRESSING 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Pile the largest leaves not suit- 
able for decorating, slice through 
into shreds with a sharp knife. 
Toss about in the bowl and sprinkle 
with salt, powdered sugar, cream 
and lemon juice, and serve at 
once. 

CABBAGE SALAD 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
This is one of the daintiest of 
winter salads: 

Shave the cabbage on a slaw 
cutter in a pan of very cold water ; 
let it soak for one hour, then press 
it dry, put it in a towel and wring 
dry. Heap in the salad bowl; at 
serving time at the table, dust it 
first with a teaspoon of salt, then 
a little pepper; sprinkle over a 
little mint sauce and six table- 



SALADS. SANDWICHES. ETC.

Spoons of olive oil. With a fork 
and spoon toss thoroughly until 
every part of the cabbage is 
covered with seasoning and oil. 
Put over two tablespoons of tarra- 
goil vinegar, mix thoroughly and 
serve. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Allow about equal parts of cold 
boiled chicken or fowl, cut in 
small cubes, and celery cut in 
thin slices. Blend with a little 
mayonnaise dressing, make it 
into a mound on a pl§.tter, cover 
with mayonnaise, or the boiled 
cream dressing if you do not like 
oU; garnish with the celery tips, 
a few capers, or minced parsley, 
or with a border of alternate slices 
of tomato and cucumber. Do 
not use tomato and beet together 
in any salad. 

MAYONNAISE 

(Miss Willis) 
If you have no ' 'mixer" you can 
make a perfect dressing in the 
following manner : 

Beat two raw egg yolks ; add one- 
half teaspoon salt and scant one- 
half teaspoon paprika and beat 
again; add four tablespoons apid, 
a little at a time, and beat thor- 
oughly. The acid may be lemon 
juice or vinegar, or both in equal 
proportions. Add one teaspoon 
olive oil, put in an egg beater and 
beat oil in thoroughly; add oil, 
about one teaspoon at a time 
for several times, then in larger 
quantities, beating vigorously. 
Add one pint of oil to the two 
eggs. Vigorous and long beat- 



ing is absolutely necessary in 
order to avoid the danger of 
mayonnaise separating or ' ' curdl- 
ing. ' ' 

To improve mayonnaise: To 
one-half cup mayonnaise salad 
dressing add one heaping teaspoon 
peanut butter, thoroughly mixed 
in a small quantity at a time. It 
gives a richer flavor. 

DRESSING FOR COLD SLAW 
(RED CABBAGE) 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Mix one rounded tablespoon sugajr, 
one-half level teaspoon, each salt 
and mustard, one-fourth level 
teaspoon pepper and one level 
teaspoon flour. Melt one level 
tablespoon Cottolene in saucepan, 
stir in the di;y mixture and add 
gradually one-half cup hot vine- 
gar. When thick and smooth, 
add quickly one beaten egg ; cook 
a moment longer and pour it hot 
into one pint shaved red cabbage 
and serve at once, hot or cold. 

Use this dressing also for any 
mixed salad of cold vegetables. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

(Mrs. Lincoln) ' 
Mix at the table in a small cup or 
bowl with a lip, one-fourth level 
teaspoon salt, a few shakes of 
paprika, or white pepper, three 
tablespoons of olive oil, or choice 
cottonseed oil, and one tablespoon 
of lemon juice or vinegar. Stir 
till the vinegar blends with the 
oil, and pour it over the salad. 
If mustard is desired, add it with 
the salt. Add also a few drops 
of onion juice. Use this to season 
or marinade flsh and meat salads

on to the salad. 

FRUIT AND NUT SALADS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix one cup each of freshly sliced 
apple and celery and one-half 
cup crumbled pecans or walnuts.

CHEESE SALAD 

(Mis. Lincoln) 
Mix cream cheese with chopped 
nuts and minced parsley, make 
into balls and serve in nest made 
of shredded lettuce. Or, fill the 
hollow parts of celery stalks with 



cream cheese, mixed with chopped 
nuts, a dash of onion, or sweet 
pepper, and moistened with a 
little mayonnaise. Heap it high 
in about two to three inches of 
the stalk. Or, pass grated Edam 
or other dry cheese with a plain 
lettuce salad, as there may be 
some who would not eat the 
lettuce with cheese. 

DATE SANDWICH 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Wash dates in tepid water, dry 
and stone them, remove scales 
and the iijner skin near stone, 
if it be tough; add an equal

EGG RELISH 

(Miss Willis) 

Bruise a clove of garlic and rub 
the inside of a frying pan with it. 
Then put in two large tablespoons 
of butter, and when it is hot pour 
in five eggs beaten until well 
mixed, with a quarter of a tea- 
spoon of salt, two dashes of pep- 
per and a little celery salt or nut-

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



Clieese 



Cheese is one of the most nutritious and economical foods for those 
persons who can digest it easily. Cookjng or melting and combining 
it with other foods that its close texture may be broken up, and add- 
ing a bit of soda to replace the potash salts taken from the milk in 
making it into cheese, will usually make cheese more digestible and 
valuable as a food. Do not over-cook it, or harden it by dry cooking. 
Being more nitrogenous than other foods and having a distinctive 
flavor, it should be served with starchy foods and those lacking in 
flavor, like potato, macaroni, rice, bread, etc. It is generally served at 
the end of a dinner as an aid to digestion, sometimes with only a wafer; , 
sometimes, by those who like the combination, with pie, and our 
English cousins make their last course at dinner one of cheese with 
celery. 



WELSH RAREBIT 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
Two cups grated cheese, two eggs, 
one-half cup of milk, salt and 
cayenne to taste. 

Toast carefully slices of bread 
with the crusts removed. While 
hot, butter them, and then 
plunge in a bowl of hot water. 
Place on a heated dish and stand 
in oven to keep warm while you 
make the" rarebit. Put the milk 
in a porcelain-lined or granite 
saucepan; stand it over a mod- 
erate iire; when boiling hot, add 
the cheese; stir continually until 
the cheese is melted; add salt, 
cayenne and yolks, and pour it 
over the toasted bread. If the 
rarebit is stringy and tough, it is 
the fault of the cheese not being 
rich enough to melt. 

Old English dairy cheese makes 
the best Welsh rarebit. Stale 
beer may be used in place of milk. 



BAKED POTATOES WITH 
CHEESE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Divide a hot baked potato in 
halves the long way, lay in a slice 
of cheese same size and one-third 
inch thick, put together, press 
slightly and cover with napkin 
and by the time it is served, cheese 
will have softened, and make a 
savory addition to the potato. 

MACARONI OR SPAGHETTI 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Break into half-inch bits, cook in 
boiling salted water till tender; 
drain, reheat in stock, or strained 
tomato, or milk, season with salt, 
pepper and butter or cream, and 
when serving cover with grated 
cheese; or after boiling, moisten 
with white sauce (see page 41), 
or tomato sauce (see page 43), 
add cheese in layers and cover 
with buttered crumbs and bake 
twenty minutes. 



CHEESE 



57 



CHEESE FONDU 

(Marion Harland) 
Two cups milk, with a pinch of 
soda stirred in ; one cup very dry, 
fine crumbs, one-half pound of 
dry cheese; four beaten eggs, 
one level tablespoon of melted 
Cottolene, pepper, salt, and a 
pinch of mace. 

Soak the crumbs in the milk; 
beat in the eggs, Cottolene, sea- 
soning, lastly the cheese. Butter 
a pudding dish; put in the mix- 
ture, strew the top ■yvith fine 
crumbs, and bake covered, half 
an hour; then brown quickly. 
Eat soon, as it will fall in cool- 
ing. 



CHEESE S0UFFL£ 

(Mrs. Rorer) 

One and a half tablespoons Cot- 
tolene, one tablespoon flour, one- 
half cup milk, one-half teaspoon 
salt, three eggs, one cup grated 
cheese, cayenne. 

Stir the flour in the Cottolene 
while heating in a saucepan. 
Pour in the milk slowly and let it 
come to a boil; add the season- 
ing, the yolks of eggs well beaten, 
and the grated cheese. Pour into 
a bowl and let cool. - When cool, 
stir in the whites of eggs beaten 
stiff. Pour into small pans, or one 
shallow pan, arid bake in a moder- 
ate oven about twenty minutes. 



Pies and Pastry 

Pies have been greatly abused, but it is their abuse rather than their 
use which should be condemned. When properly made with Cotto- 
lene and eaten at suitable times and in moderation, they are no more 
indigestible for a normal person than are many other foods which so 
far have escaped this unjust criticism. , 

Cottolene is well adapted for pastry ; for it makes a light and deli- 
cate crust, and is much more wholesome than either butter or lard. 

As Cottolene contains no salt, always add salt in pastry making; 
This is a universal rule and must not be forgotten. 

Where Cottolene is used in place of lard or butter in recipes not 
in this book, be sure and use one-third less than where lard or butter 
is called for. 

The best results are obtained when all the ingredients in the mix- 
ing of the pastry are exceedingly cold. , 



PASTRY FOR ONE PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Mix one scant half level teaspoon 
salt with one and one-half cup 
pastry flour. Chop in with a 
knife a scant one-half cup of 
chilled Cottolene. When it is well 



cut toget}ier, mix in very grad- 
ually three tablespoons cold water, 
chopping the mixture and try- 
ing to avoid wet streaks. Do not 
knead witti the hands. If soft 
lay the paste in a pan on ice until 
chilled. Sprinkle some flour on

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



the, molding-board; flour the 
rolling pin; roll into rectangular 
shape, gather together like a jelly 
roll, divide in two pieces, stand 
piece on end, pat it flat, then roll 
in circular shape till a little larger 
than the plate. When rolled to 
the required size cover the sides 
and bottom of the pie dish. Fill 
with the pie material. Roll the 
other part of the paste in the same 
way, making it one-half inch 
larger than the plate to allow for 
the filling and pufiing in baking. 
Make several incisions in the top 
crilst before you lay it on, that 
there may be an outlet for the 
steam, especially for meat pies. 
Put it on loosely, throwing the 
fullness back into the center with 
the edges just even and press 
them slightly together, first wet- 
ting the lower edge if it is for a 
juicy pie. Press the two crusts 
back slightly from the edge of 
the plate and mark, or not, as you 
please, with a fork or crimper. 

Marking keeps the crust from 
pufiing, and it also helps to retain 
the juice. Binding the crust to 
the plate with an inch strip of 
wet cloth is about the surest way 
to keep in the juice. 

CHOPPED PASTE 

(Mrs, Lincoln) 

Mix one level teaspoon of baking 
powder and one scant half level 
teaspoon salt with one heaped 
cup of sifted pastry flour. Chop 
in one heaped tablespoon of chilled 
Cottolene and mix to a stiff dough 
with cold water. Toss out on 
floured board, pat into rectangu- 



lar shape, and if to use at once 
divide in halves and roll to fit the 
plate. If the paste is^ soft, or 
you are not ready to make the 
pies, keep it in ice-chest wrapped 
in wet cloth between two pans. 
A larger amount of paste may be 
made, if many pies are to be pre- 
pared, and kept on hand in this 
way; but pies are better if filled 
and baked when needed. 

APPLE PIE 

(Mts. Lincoln) 
Line a tin pie plate with paste ; 
cut five or six greening apples in 
quarters, remove skin and core 
and lay the quarters round the 
edge of the plate uniformly. 
If apples are very large, cut each 
quarter in half, but usually one 
thick piece of apple will soften in 
baking as quickly as several thin 
pieces piled one- on another. 
Heap the dish with the broken 
pieces in center. Sprinkle two 
tablespoons of water over the 
fruit, but do' not sweeten until 
baked. Lay the upper crust on 
lightly without pressing the edges. 
Bake till apples are soft. When 
the crust is brown raise it a litfle 
and if the apples are tender 
remove the pie from the oven. 
Slip a knife arovmd between the 
crusts and lay the top aside. 
Melt and boil slightly one-half 
cup of sugar, or more if apples are 
very tart, in two tablespoons of 
water, add one teaspoon of butter, 
or a few grains of salt, and any 
spice desired (cinnamon, nutmeg 
or allspice — but lemon juice with a 
a little of the grated rind is best

of all). Pour this syrup over the 
apple, being sure that every part 
has its share, replace the cover, 
press the edges together, and you 
have a pie in which you will 
surely have saved all the juice 
and flavor of the fruit. 

CHERRY OR BERRY PIES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Line a deep earthen or granite 
pie plate with paste, put a half- 
inch strip round the edge, first 
wetting the lower paste. Sprinkle 
over the paste one-half cup of 
sugar mixed with one rounded 
tablespoon of flour and dot it 
with one teaspoon of butter. Fill 
the plate with cherries or fruit, 
which have been washed, drained, 
stoned, and rolled in sugar. Cut 
through the upper crust in two or 
three places, lay it over the fruit 
and press the edges close to the 
rim. Bake about half an hour 
and serve while warm. 

CREAM PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Line a shallow plate with a crust, 
prick several holes in it to pre- 
vent rising unevenly, put on a 
border half an inch wide using 
fluted j agger for cutting; bake 
quickly and set away to cool. 
Mix one level tablespoon of corn- 
starch and two rounded table- 
spoons of sugar and stir them into 
the beaten yolk of one egg, add 
one-fourth level teaspoon salt, the 
beaten white and two cups of hot 
milk. Strain into double boiler 
and cook twenty minutes stirring 
frequently. Flavor with vanilla 
and pour into the baked crust. 



Serve cold without any cover; 
or, if you like, spread a thin layer 
of apple jelly .over the top, cover 
with a meringue of two egg whites 
and one-half cup powdered sugar 
beaten stiff and slightly browned. 

CUSTARD PIE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Use a plate about an inch and a 
half deep, with not too flaring 
edge. Roll out crust an inch 
larger than the plate, turn the 
edge under, first being sure that 
no bubbles of air are left between 
crust and plate, and pinch the 
crust into a fluted rim. Heat 
three cups milk, beat yolks of 
three eggs with one-half cup sugar 
till light, add one-half teaspoon 
salt and a little grated nutmeg, if 
you like it ; add the hot milk and 
the whites of eggs beaten ■ only 
till foamy. Beating the whites 
separately may seem unneces- 
sary, but it gives a more uniform- 
ly browned crust, of fine grain 
like that of nice cake, instead of 
the blistered patches of brown 
over a yellow uneven surface 
which is often seen. Brush the 
under crust With a little white of 
egg left in bowl, dredge lightly 
with flour and then strain the 
custard into the dish, adding the 
last portion after setting the dish 
in the oven, if it seems to be too 
full. Bake slowly till it pufiEs up 
all over and a knife inserted in 
the center will come out clean and 
not milky. 

LEMON PIE WITH MERINGUE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Mix one heaped tablespoon flour.

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



or slightly less of cornstarch, with 
three-fourths cup sugar, and scant 
one-fourth teaspoon salt, add the 
well, beaten yolks of three eggs, 
and white of one^ the grated rind 
of half and juice of one large 
lemon, and one cup water. Bake 
it in plate lined with rich crust 
in a moderate oven. Beat whites 
of two eggs with one-half cup 
powdered sugar till very stiff, 
pile it roughly on the pie and color 
it slightly in moderate oven. 

MtNCE PIE MEAT 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

The proportions for one cup of 
meat are given, and the recipe 
may be doubled or quadrupled 
as desired. One cup each of 
chopped boiled meat, seeded 
raisins, brown sugar, meat, liquor, 
and boiled cider; three cups 
chopped apples; one-fourth cup 
each of chopped citron and molas- 
ses, and any stewed dried fruit 
(peach, apricot, or prune); one 
tablespoon each of salt and cinna- 
mon, one-half teaspoon each of 
mace and nutmeg and allspide if 
you like, the juice of one orange 
and one lemon with grated rind of 
half, or one strip of candied peel, 
a few grains of pepper, and when 
the pies are ready to bake sprinkle 
each with one-half teaspoon rose 
water. Use beef from the neck 
or round — juicy, lean, with a 
little fat; cook in the liquor and 
use this for moisture. If boiled 
cider is not at hand, use syrup 
from sweet pickle; or, use more 
lemon and orange juice. Mix 
thoroughly and cook till apples 



are clear. Seal in jars for keep- 
ing. Wine and brandy may be 
used if considered necessary, but 
it is good enough without. 

PUMPKIN PIE 

(Mxs. Lincoln) 
Use the small, deep-colored pump- 
kins, cut in quarters, remove seeds 
and bake it skin side down till 
tender; scoop out pulp and sift 
it. For one pie allow, if baked in 
a deep plate, two cups of pump- 
kin, two cups scalded milk, one 
beaten egg, or one common crack- 
er rolled fine, one-half level tea- 
spoon ginger, one-fourth cup 
sugar, one-fourth cup molasses, 
one level teaspoon salt, and if you 
like grandmother's way, add two 
tablespoons of boiled and seeded 
raisins. Always boil raisins first, 
for the baking in the pie will not 
cook them enough. Mix in the 
order given and bake in a deep 
plate lined and bordered with a 
plain or fluted rim. It is done 
when it puffs in center and shrinks 
away from the edge. 

RAISIN PIE 

(Miss Willis) 
Grate the yellow from one lemon, 
discard all the white part of rind 
and seeds. Chop remainder of 
lemon and a cup of stoned raisins 
together, add a pinch of. salt, a 
piece of butter the size of walnut, 
half a. cup of molasses, one cup 
of brown sugar and two cups of 
water. Boil all together five 
minutes. Then thicken with five 
tablespoons flour. Bake with two 
crusts.

APPLE CAKES 

(Miss Willis) 

Two eggs, one cup sugar, one- 
half cup milk, two cups flour, two 
teaspoons baking powder, one 
scant tablespoon Cottolene, melt- 
ed. Measure the flour and add to 
the baking powder; beat the 
eggs; add the sugar and beat 
again; add milk and flour alter- 
nately; the Cottolene is put in 
last. Pour into two greased 
Washington pie plates and put 
the apples on top as thickly as 
you can. If the slices will stand 
up, so much the better. (The 
apples are pared, cut in eighths, 
and these eighths again divided 
into two or three sections). 
Sprinkle with about two table- 
spoons sugar and bake for half an 
hour, or until done. Serve hot. 

COCOANUT CUSTARD 

(Mrs. Rorer) 
One pint milk, two eggs, one-half 
cup sugar, one-half grated nut- 
meg, one cup grated cocoanut. 
Beat the eggs and sugar to- 
gether until light, then add the 
milk, nutmeg and cocoanut. Line 
two pie dishes with plain paste, 
fill them with this mixture, and 
bake in a quick oven for thirty 
minutes. 

CHINESE DUMPLINGS 

(Miss Willis) 
Put a quart of ripe tomatoes into 
a shallow dish, add seasoning of 
salt, pepper and a little butter, 
and a little ginger, if liked. Cover 
and let them get boiling hot. 
Meanwhile make a drop batter 
with two cups of sifted flour, two 



teaspoons baking powder, one- 
half teaspoon salt and sufficient 
water to make batter that will 
drop from a spoon. Add a cup 
of cooked sausage meat or highly 
seasoned cooked meat to the 
batter and drop it from a spoon 
on top of the boiling tomatoes. 
Cover closely and steam for twen- 
ty minutes. Serve dumplings as 
a border around the tomatoes. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS 

(Miss Willis) 
For six dumplings use half the 
rule for pie crust, and six large 
tart apples. Core and pare the 
apples. Divide the paste into 
six parts, and roll outgone piece 
into a shape and size that will 
cover the apple. Place an apple 
on this and fill the center with 
sugar, a lump of butter the size 
of a hazelnut and some cinnamon. 
Now draw the paste over the 
apples and press the edges to- 
gether. Put the dumplings in a 
baking pan, the rough side down, 
and proceed with the others in the 
same manner. Bake in a moder- 
ately hot oven for half an hour. 
Serve hot with a nutmeg or cold 
sauce. 

SULTANA TARTS 

(MrSs. Armstrong) 

Make pastry with one and one- 
halt cups of flour, one teaspoon 
of salt, five tablespooiis of Cotto- 
lene and two of butter. Wash 
the salt from the butter and pat 
out into a flat cake. Cut the 
Cottolene into the flour as for 
any pastry and then moisten with 
ice-water. Flatten the paste out

with rolling-pin, lay the butter on 
this, inclose from either side of 
crust, making three folds, then 
turn, roll and fold as usual and 
chill thoroughly before using. 
Roll out thin, cut into rotmds and 
bake over inverted mufiin tins. 

For the filling, scald one and 
one-half cups of milk and thicken 
with one - fourth cup of flour 
mixed with one- third cup of sugar 
and a little cold milk. Cook in 
double boiler for ten minutes, add 



a little salt and two beaten egg 
yolks, and when cool flavor with 
vanilla and sherry. Before filling 
the shells of pastry, add one-half 
cup of Sultana raisins to the 
custard (if raisins are hard they 
may be softened by adding to hot 
filling when done). Cover with a 
meringue made of two egg whites, 
four tablespoons of sugar and a 
little nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Brown lightly and serve very 
cold. 



Puddings and Satices 

Use Cottolene in puddings the same as you would butter, except to use 
one-third less of Cottolene, unless the quantity given is very small. 
The same amount of Cottolene as of butter would make the article 
too rich. Make your rich pudding on days when you have the second 
serving of a roast, or some made-over dish, or at times when the first 
course is less in quantity than usual. 



CUP CUSTARDS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Scald one quart of rich creamy 
milk. Beat four egg yolks; add 
four tablespoons sugar and one- 
half level teaspoon salt and beat 
till thick like cream. Beat the 
whites till foamy, not stiflE, mix 
well with the yolks and add hot 
milk. Stand cups in a shallow 
pan in the oven, stir the foam 
down and fill cups to overflow- 
ing, or nearly so. Put hot water 
in the pan and bake in a hot oven, 
watching them carefully that 
they do not scorch. Lay but- 
tered paper over if needed. Test 
with a knife as soon as they begin 
to puff and if clean, not milky, 
they are done. A little nutmeg 



may be used if liked, but many 
prefer the simple flavor of the 
custard, or to boil the sugar to 
caramel. (See page 63. Sago- 
pudding.) 

RICE PUDDING 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Known also as creamy, and poor 
man's pudding. Soak for half 
an hour three tablespoons of 
washed rice and three tablespoons 
of sugar (rounded measure) in a 
quart of milk in a baking dish. 
Bake very slowly, stir up from 
bottom two or three times. Bake 
two or three hours, or till rice is 
soft, whole, and surrounded by a 
rich, creamy syrup. It should 
not bake dry, nor be underdone.

half cup sugar in a saucepan till 
brown, add one-half cup water 
and stir into the sago. This gives 
caramel flavor. Turn into a 
greased pudding dish and bake 
about twenty minutes. Eat hot 
with butter. One egg is suffi- 
cient. Do not be tempted to 
make it less delicate by adding 
more. 

SPICE PUDDDfG

spoons melted Cottolene. Grease 
some half pint tin cups, or small 
Cottolene pail, or half pound 
cans, half fill with the batter, 
cover with greased paper, or the 
tin covers if they have them; set 
them on a pan in a kettle of boil-

hour. Replenish the water as 
needed, and keep half of the 
mould in the water all the time. 
Serve with leinon sauce. 

GINGER PUDDING 

(Mrs. Armstrong) 
Mix together thoroughly one and

(Mis. Rorer) 
One-fourth pound beef suet, small 
piece stick cinnamon, grated rind 
of one lemon, one pint Indian 
meal, one pint milk, three eggs, 
one gill molasses. 

Chop the suet very fine and 
mix with the Indian meal; put 
the cinnamon in the milk, then 
put it in a farina boiler to scald; 
strain it while hot and stir in 
gradually the Indian meal and 
suet; add the molasses; cover 
the mixture and let stand over 



night. In the morning beat the 
eggs, without separating, until 
very light; stir them into the 
pudding, turn into a greased mold 
or well-floured pudding bag, leav- 
ing plenty of room for it to swell. 
If in a mold, put on the cover; if 
in a bag, secure it well at the tying 
place, lest the water should get 
in, which will infallibly spoil it. 
Put it iijto a pot of boiling water 
and boil continuously for five 
hours; replenish the water as it 
evaporates with boiling water. 
When ready to serve, remove the 
pudding carefully from the mold 
or bag and serve immediately

for half an hour; beat the yolks 
and sugar together until light; 
then add them to the crumbs and 
milk; mix and add the lemon. 
Pour into the pudding dish and

Whipped cream looks very at- 
tractive with it, but it will not 
blend with the jelly so well as 
will the thin cream. 

BANANA CUSTARD 

(Miss Willis) 
Put into a saucepan four table- 
spoons cornstarch, one cup gran- 
ulated sugar, one-third of a cup 
of butter, and beat together until 
mixed smooth, then pour in one 
quart of freshly boiled water. 
Beat the yolks of three eggs very 
light and add the mixture to 
them. Place over the fire in a 
double boiler and cook and stir 
until thick. Mince some fine 
ripe bananas very fine, sprinkle 
them lightly with lemon juice 
and add to the custard when it is 
cold. Turn into a pudding dish. 
Beat the whites of the eggs to a 
very stiff froth and fold in lightly 
one-haJf cup powdered sugar. 
Flavor with juice of one-half 
lemon. Heap on top of the 
pudding and brown lightly in the 
oven or with salamander. Serve 
cold. 

FRUIT WHIP 

(Miss Willis) 

A quick dessert may be made 
from two large tablespoons of 
raspberry jam, and the same of 
currant jelly, beaten with the 
whites of two eggs, and two table- 
spoons of fine sugar. Mix all 
together and beat until very light. 
Place in slender glasses and serve 
with small fancy cakes. 

Blueberries and rhubarb may 
be combined for jam. Use one- 
third more of the pieplant, by 



measure, than you do berries. 
Use a little water, only just 
enough to keep the mass from 
burning, and sweeten well, (^ook 
for fifteen minutes and seal in 
jars. For pies it may be canned 
with less sugar. 

A little lemon juice, or vinegar, 
improves blueberry pies. 

SNOW PUDDING OR LEMON 
SPONGE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Soak one-fourth box gelatine in 
one-fourth cup cold water till 
soft; dissolve it in one cup of 
boiling water, add one cup sugar 
and one-fourth cup clear lemon 
juice. When the sugar is dis- 
solved strain it into a large bowl 
and let it cool. Break three 
eggs and reserve the yolks for a 
custard sauce made as for soft 
custard. Beat the whites slowly 
till firm and as the gelatine be- 
gins to stiffen beat it till light, 
and add it to the egg and beat all 
together till very light and white. 
When stiff enough to drop, turn 
it into a deep glass dish and let it 
become very cold before serving. 
Serve the custard in a pitcher and 
garnish the dish of snow with 
drained canned pears as large and 
white as possible. 

ORANGE CREAM

pared and cored apples, -or peach- 
es, quinces, or pears, or one quart 
rhubarb cut in inch pieces, or 
half a pound of stewed prunes. 
Add one cup of sugar and bake 
till fruit is tender. Serve hot 
with cream. Or, use fresh ber- 
ries, or fruits requiring no cook- 
ing, or one cup of any prefe?red 
jelly, and simply stir them into 
the hot tapioca, and turn into a 
dish and serve cold, with cream 
and sugar.

SOFT CUSTARD SAUCE 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
One pint milk, three eggs, one- 
half cup powdered sugar, one 
teaspoon vanilla. 

Put the milk on to boil in a 
farina boiler. Beat the eggs and , 
sugar together until light and 
creamy, then stir them into the

Pick over and wash two quarts 
of cranberries in plenty of cold 
water; put them into a porcelain- 
lined saucepan, with a cup of hot 
water, and one pound of sugar, 
and stew them gently until they 
are tender enough to rub -through 
a sieve; then use them a^ a sauce 
for roast pig or turkey, or cool 
the sauce in a jelly mold. If the 
sauce is cooled in molds wet with 
cold water, it will make a jelly 
firm enough to turn out in the 
shape of the molds. ^

ened. Add two eggs beaten with 
another half cup of sugar, stir 
until egg is set. Strain, and 
when cold freeze; use three parts 
fine ice and one part rock salt. 
Half a cup of cream or more will 
improve it, but it is good with- 
out, and will not taste of flour if 
well cooked. More eggs niay be 
used if liked richer. 

STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

Mash one quart of fresh clean ber-

quart of thin scalded cream. ' 
Cool, add a bit of salt and one 
teaspoon of vanilla extract, or 
enough to flavor to taste. Strain 
and freeze as usual. 

LEMON ICE CREAM 

(Miss Willis) 

Two quarts cream, two cups 
white sugar, juice and rind of four

four hours to ripen. 

CHOCOLATE PARFAIT 

(Mrs; Lincoln) 
Stir two squares of unsweetened 
chocolate, one-half cup of sugar, 
and one-half cup of water over 
the fire and boil until thick. Beat 
yolks of two eggs with one-half 
cup of sugar, and a bit of salt, add 
them to the chocolate and cook 
over hot water till the egg is thick. 
Cool in a pan of cold water, stirr- 
ing frequently. Flavor one cup 
of thick cream with vanilla, whip 
it stiff, and fold it into the cooked 
mixture. Pack it into a mold, 
solidly and very full, cover with 
buttered paper an inch larger 
than the mold, and buttled 
side up ; put on the tin cover and 
immerse it in equal parts of fine 
ice and rock salt for three hours. 

CAFt PARFAIT 

(Miss Willis) 

Boil one cup sugar and one-fourth 
cup clear black coffee together 
to thread degree and then pour 
in a fine stream into the beaten 
yolks of six eggs. Return to the 
fire in a double boiler and stir 
and cook until the mixture coats 
a spoon. Beat until cold, then 
add one pint of double cream, 
fiavored with one-fourth cup 
strong, clear coffee and whipped 
stiff and dry. Pack in ice and 
coarse salt for four hours after 
placing in the mold. Do not 
freeze a parfait by turning as you 
do ice cream, sherbets, etc. 



CARAMEL MOUSSE 

, (Mis. Lincoln) 

Melt one-half cup of sugar in a 
saucepan and stir till dark brown; 
add one-half cup of boiling water, 
simmer ten minutes. Then dis- 
solve in it one level tablespoon 
of granulated gelatine which has 
been soaking in cold water to 
cover, till soft. When cold stir 
into it one pint of thick cream, 
whip it stiff, pack it in a mold or 
the freezer can and keep it in ice 
and salt (equal parts) for three 
hours. 

WATER ICES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Are made with sweetened fruit 
juices, diluted more or less with 
water. If desired clear and hard, 
they are frozen by using one part 
rock salt and three parts fine ice, 
turning the beater only often 
enough to keep it from becoming 
clogged; then, after removing the 
beater and packing the mixture 
tightly in the can or mold and 
surrounding it with ice and salt, it 
is left to ripen for an hour or 
more. Boiling the water and 
sugar to a syrup gives to all 
frozen mixtures a finer flavor 
than when used unboiled, and a 
quantity may be prepared to 
save time when needed. 

FRAPPf 

(Mis. Lincoln) 

This is any water ice frozen soft, 
or till of the consistency of mush. 
By using from one-half to equal 
parts of salt and ice, a granular 
texture is secured. The mixture 
is usually served at once and melts 
quickly.

SHERBETS 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Are water ices with a creamy 
consistency, obtained by using 
the beaten white of egg, or a little 
gelatine, and turning the crank 
rapidly to make the mixture light. 
Or, they are milk ices flavored 
with fruit juices. 

LEMON SHERBET 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Soak one-half teaspoon of gela- 
tine in one-half cup of cold water 
till soft. Boil four cups of water 
and two cups of sugar ten min- 
utes. Halve six large, juicy lem- 
ons, remove seeds and press out 
the juice; add that with the gela- 
tine to the hot syrup and if 
needed add more sugar; when 
dissolved strain and cool. Freeze 
by turning the crank rapidly 
until creamy .and stiff. None of 
the volatile oil from the lemon 
rind is used, and many prefer 
this mild flavor. If lemon ices 
lack brightness, or are too sweet, 
add a little citric acid, or cream 



of tartar. If the flavor of the 
rind is preferred, steep thin por- 
tions of it in the syrup. 

BANANA SHERBET 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 

Boil one pint each of sugar and 
water ten minutes; stir hot into 
the beaten whites of two eggs; 
add one-half cup of lemon juice, 
and the mashed pulp of six banan- 
as. Strain and when cool freeze 
as for sherbet. 

VELVET MILK SHERBET 

(Miss Willis) 

Scald one quart milk in double 
boiler. Add two cups sugar and 
stir until dissolved and milk 
looksi blue, then set away to cool; 
when cold, pack the freezer. 
Turn in the cold milk, cover, let 
stand five minutes, then turn 
occasionally until it seems ice 
cold, then add the strained juice 
of three lemons. Turn until the 
sherbet is quite thick. Add a 
meringue made with whites of 
two eggs, and two tablespoons 
powdered sugar. Work thor- 
oughly together, finish freezing, 
repack and set away for two hours 
to ripen. This is delicious. 



Canning and Preserving 

In caiming, the jars should be thoroughly washed; the fruits must be 
cooked in the jars or filled into them boiling hot. The lid must be 
sterile and put on the jar while both the jar and the lid are hot, and 
they must not be opened until needed for use. 

Large fruits are better cooked in the jars; small fruits may be 
cooked in a preserving kettle and filled in the jars, providing they are 
carefully handled. Small fruits should be just ripe, not under or over 



CANNING AND PRESERVIN,G 



71 



ripe. This is also a good thing to remember in jelly making. Over- 
ripe fruits will not combine with sugar to make a brittle, clean jelly. 

A good dear syrup for preserving is made by using a pound of 
sugar to half a pint of water; before it begins to boil, beat into it the 
white of an egg slightly beaten; remove the scum as it rises until it is 
perfectly dear. 

For covering tumblers of jellies and preserves, melted paraffine is 
excellent. Pour it over the perfectly cold jelly and it will form a thin 
crust that is dean, tasteless and durable. It can be taken ofi and 
used again. Mutton tallow is sometimes used for the same purpose. 



CANNED FRUITS 
Raspberries, etc. 

(Mis. Lincoln) 
One quart berries, one-fourth 
cup water, one-half to one cup 
sugar. Use only fresh fruit, free 
from mold, and rinse quickly; 
one spot of decay will often spoil 
the whole mass. Lay aside the 
large berries, mash the broken 
portions, heat them in the water 
in porcelain kettle till the juice 
flows. Press juice out through 
cheese cloth, add to the sugar and 
when boiling add reserved ber- 
ries; press them with wooden or 
silver spoon under the syrup 
without stirring to break them; 
boU fast three minutes. Have 
large-mouthed jars, pint size 
preferred, with perfect rubbers 
and covers, scalded and standing 
in pan of hot water near by. Put 
on the rubber, skim fruit into 
jar, boil syrup two minutes longer, 
strain into the jar, fiU to over- 
flowing, put on cover and damp, 
wipe and set away. Follow this 
method for other fruit, adding 
more water for blackberries, more 
sugar for strawberries, and use 
less of each for blueberries; cut 
rhubarb in inch pieces and use 



two cups sugar; cut pineapple in 
half inch slices or bits, discarding 
the core, and add one tablespoon 
lemon juice; stone cherries, or a 
part of them at 'least, and add 
more sugar to the sour varieties. 
Cut large peaches and pears in 
halves, remove skin, core or 
stone; add slivers of lemon rind 
to pears and a few of the stones 
to peaches. Cook till tender in 
the syrup, or in water if hard, 
allowing two cups of water to 
each quart of pared fruit. Cut 
quinces in quarters, pare and re- 
move all the granular part near 
the core; cook in clear water till 
soft and allow from one to two 
cups of sugar. 

PRESERVES 

(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Follow the same general direc- 
tions as for canning, but allow 
equal weight of sugar and fruit 
and cook the fruit longer in the 
syrup, boiling the latter down till 
quite thick. 

PRESERVED PEACHES 

(Marion Harland) 
Weigh the fruit after it is pared 
and the stones extracted, and 
allow a pound of sugar to every

PURE FOOD RECIPES 



one of the peaches. Crack one- 
quarter of the stones, extract the 
kernels, break them to pieces and 
boil in just enough water to cover 
them, until soft, when set aside 
to steep in a covered vessel. Put 
a layer of sugar at the bottom of. 
the kettle, thai one of fruit, and 
so on, until you have used up aU 
of both; set it where it wiU warm 
slowly, until the sugar is melted 
and the fruit hot through. Then 
strain the kernel water and add 
it. Boil steadily until the peach- 
es are tender and clear. Take 
them out with a perforated 
skimmer and lay upon large, flat 
dishes, crowding as little as pos- 
sible. Boil the syrup almost to a 
jelly — that is, until clear and 
thick, skimming off all the scum. 
Fill two jars two- thirds full of ;the 
peaches, pour on the boiling syrup 
and, when cold, cover with brandy 
tissue paper, then with cloth, 
lastly with thick paper tied 
tightly over them. The peaches 
should be ready td take o& after 
half an hour's boiling; the syrup 
should be boiled fifteen minutes lon- 
ger,fast,at]:doftenstirred,to throw 
up the scum. A few slices of 
pineapple cut up with the peaches 
flavor them finely. 

JELLIES 

Currant, etc. 
(Mrs. Lincoln) 
Pick over and mash the currants, 
let them drain without pressure 
over night. Measure the juice 
and allow an equal amount of 
fine . granulated sugar. Put not 
more than three pints to two 



quarts of the juice on to boil at a 
time, boil fifteen minutes. Have 
the sugar hot in the oven, stir it 
in and when boiling skim it, and 
boil from three to five minutes, or 
4iU it thickens on a cold plate; 
pour into glasses which have 
been in hot water, and when cold 
cover with paper. Cut soft brown 
or white paper one-hatf inch 
larger than the glass, dip it into 
flour and water mixed to the con- 
sistency of thick milk. Drain, 
spread it on the top, draw the 
edges down smoothly and when 
dry it will be tight as a drumhead. 
Fruit juices that have water 
with them, like stewed apples or 
grapes, should boil long enough to 
evaporate this water; but never 
boil the sugar with the juice more 
than five minutes. Apple jelly 
may be made ■*ith one-fourth 
less sugar, and g^een grapes re- 
quire one-fourth more usuallv. 
Peaches, strawberries, and rasp- 
berries alone, make a thick syrup, 
which is not jelly; but combined 
with apple or currant juice, they 
will be firm and satisfactory. 

SWEET PICKLES 

(Hrs. Lincoln) 

Boil one quart vinegar, four 
pounds brown sugar and one cup 
of mixed whole cinnamon, all- 
spice, cassia buds and a few cloves 
(tied in a bag), cook in it eight 
pounds of fruit, ten minutes or 
till well scalded. Use ripe toma- 
toes peeled ; or peaches, wiped if 
woolly, pared if preferred; pears 
pared, and if hard, stewed till 
tender in clear water; or the rind

Five pounds of curranlts freed 
from stems, two pounds seeded 
chopped raisins, five pounds sugar, 
four oranges. Ckwk currants, rais- 
ins, and sugar together fifteen 
minutes after the mixture reaches 
the boiling point; add the grated 
rind and juice of oranges and cook 
all together five minutes longer. 
Serve as a relish with meat. 

Gooseberries may be used in 
place of currants. 

CUCUMBER PICEXES 

(Mis. Lincoln) 
Make a brine strong enough to 
float an egg — one pint of coarse 



salt and six quarts of boiling 
water; boil and skim till clear. 
Pick the cucumbers as they 
ripen, wash carefully without re- 
moving the prickles or breaking 
the skin, leave a bit of the stem 
on, and keep them covered with 
the brine. When you have enough 
for a jar, or after they have stood 
in the brine two days, drain them 
from brine, put into the jar, pour 
boiling spiced vinegar over and 
seal. 

A NEW MARMALADE 

Oranges knd Rhubarb in Delicious 

Combination 

(Miss Willis) 

A delicious and little known 
marmalade is made by adding to 
each quart of cut rhubarb six 
oranges and one and one-half 
pounds of granulated sugar. The 
white rind and the seeds are re- 
moved from the oranges, but the 
yellow peel and the fruit are to be 
sliced into the porcelain-lined 
preserving kettle after the rhu- 
barb and the sugar are in it 
This whole is boiled slowly until 
quite done and thick enough to 
suit. Sometimes three instead of 
six oranges are used, and a pound 
of fine seeded or seedless raisins 
take their place.

INVALID COOKERY

Invalid Cooliery 

There are many food preparations in the market now — malted, 
peptonized, albumenized, etc., adapted to nearly every condition, or 
degree of invalidism. Milk has come to be considered by many phy- 
sicians as the most suitable food for those seriously ill, varied by eggs, 
and simple broths ; therefore, it seems unnecessary to take space for 
more than a few of these combinations. Cleanliness and delicacy in 
all appointments, and dainty serving, often add greatly to the value 
of the food, and should never be overlooked. 



BEEF JUICE 

Broil half a pound of lean, juicy 
round steak, cut one inch thick, 
until each side is just seared and 
the juice will flow when cut. 
Divide into small pieces and press 
in a lemon squeezer (or a oieat 
press if you have one), put the 
juice into a small saucepan and 
stand it in hot water, stir till the 
liquid is hot, but do not let it 
boil or cook enough to curdle. 
Salt slightly and serve immedi- 
ately. If you have cup in hot 
water and work quickly, there 
will be no need of reheating juice. 

GRUEL 

Have two cups of water (if rolled ' 
or flaked oatmeal is used— or three 
cups, if granulated meal) and one 
level teaspoon salt boiling briskly 
in top of double boiler. Stir in 
one cup of meal, boil rapidly five 
minutes, "then place top part of 
boiler over the lower part, cover, 
and cook from 30 to 60 minutes. 
When thoroughly cooked, take 
one-fourth cup of the mush, stir 
into milk or water and rub through 
a strainer. Heat, season and serve. 
Dilute with cream or milk. 



HOT EGGS FOR INVALIDS 

Place a small bowl, suitable for 
serving, in a pan of water just off 
the boiling point ; put in one tea- 
spoon butter and let it run over 
the bottom and sides; break in 
one or two eggs, add a bit of salt, 
and pepper if liked, and stir with 
a spoon till egg is mingled and 
tastes hot; serve at once with 
toast or wafers. This is more 
acceptable to an invalid than is a 
cold raw egg, or a soft egg with 
the white stringy and half- 
cooked. 

JUNKET 

Warm one pint of milk to blood 
heat, dissolve in it one tablespoon 
sugar and one -fourth teaspoon 
salt, flavor with one teaspoon 
vanilla or one tablespoon wine, or 
strong coffee; stir in quickly one 
junket tablet and turn into, a dish 
for serving. When firm and cold 
serve with sugar and cream, or 
with any fruit whip made by 
beating one egg white and one 
cup of mashed or grated fresh 
fruit, or stewed fruit, slowly till 
stiff. 



After the Meal is Over 

comes the washing of dishes, and the cleaning of 
greasy, dirty, pots and pans. The preparation of 
the meal is usually a pleasure; the clearing lip, dis- 
agreeable. 

Why not "let the Gold DUst Twins do your work"? 
GOLD DUST WASHING POWDER is the quickest 
dish-washer ever invented. It is a vegetable-oil soap 
ground into a smooth, golden powder, which dissolves 
instantly in any kind of water, cuts dirt and grease 
like magic, and does the big end of the work without 
your assistance. 

GOLD DUST is also unequaled for cleaning wood- 
work, scrubbing floors, cleaning refrigerators, bath- 
room fixtures, oilcloth, silverware, and for washing 
clothes. 

GOLD DUST makes every- 
thing it touches clean and 
sweet, and does it so quick- 
ly and well that, once you 
have used it, you would 
as soon try to bake without 
flour as keep house with- 
out GOLD DUST. At all 
grocers — Look for the twins 
on the package.
