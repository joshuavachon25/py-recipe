INTRODUCTION 



THE problem of home cooking is to prepare appetizing 
and wholesome meals, with due regard to expenditure 
of time and money. 

The typical cooking, course teaches the art by means of 
separate dishes, leaving the student at a loss when it comes 
to combining them or to preparing whole meals of several 
dishes at the same time. 

The beginner, with only a cook book for a guide, often 
attempts the most difficult and complicated dishes first, with 
failure and discouragement, loss of time and materials as 
the result. The cook book gives little help in serving whole- 
some food combination and a balanced diet. It does not 
answer the ever-present question, "What shall be provided 
for today, for tomorrow, for the day after?" 

In this series of lessons is presented a systematic cor- 
respondence course in the cooking of meals, with detailed 
directions, not only for cooking the separate dishes, but also 
for preparing and serving each meal as a whole. 

The course is divided into twelve parts, each containing 
the recipes for a week's menu, typical of one month in the 
year. With the exception of seasonable fruits and vege- 
tables, the menus may be applied to any month. In the 
first lessons the simplest recipes are gives, gradually increas- 
ing in difficulty to advanced work in the lessons of the later 
months. The recipes, in most cases, give quantities suit- 
able for serving a family of four. The cost of the food 
served is now omitted because so variable, but its food value 
is given, followed by suggestions for reducing the cost, if 
desired. 



INIBOBVCTION 

The menus are planned to give pleasing, variety, whole- 
some food combination, and well-balanced meals which may 
be prepared with economy of time, effort and money. Menus 
for special occasions are included, as for Thanksgiving and 
Christmas dinners, form.al and informal luncheons and din- 
ners, chafing-dish supjers, birthday and children's parties, 
etc. 

Each part contains one or more special articles relating 
to the "Preparation of Meals," such as waiting on table, 
carving, dishwashing, candy making, marketing, fuels, plan- 
ning menus, canning, preserving, etc. Helpful hints and 
suggestions are given throughout the lessons and at the end 
of many of the parts. A summary of all the menus, glos- 
sary, bibliography and full and complete index are provided 
at the end. 

In the following course, the student is expected to cook 
and serve all of the meals given in Part I during the first 
month, the meals in Part II during the second month, and 
so on through the twelve parts. The written work consists 
in sending a detailed report of each month's work, telling of 
successes and failures, giving time spent in cooking, the cost 
of the meals served, and asking questions. Report blanks 
are furnished. A certificate, i6 by 21 inches, on parch- 
ment bond, is awarded if the twelve reports are made. 

In the preparation of the course, the literature of cooking 
has been examined thoroughly and the assistance of a num- 
ber of prominent teachers of cookery has been obtained. 
The course is offered in the expectation that it will prove 
particularly helpful to beginners and be welcomed as well 
by those who have had experience but who desire to perfect 
themselves further in modern methods of cooking.

TABLES AND DEFINITIONS 

The following tables and definitions are taken from the 
Bulletin of the American School of Home Economics, en- 
titled "Free Hand Cooking." In it an attempt has been 
made to simplify the art of cookery by concentrating and 
by classifying according to process. Fundamental recipes 
are given which are capable of infinite variation. The 
complete Bulletin may be obtained from the School for ten 
cents. 

The pages are included here as a general guide and for 
quick reference. Details and specific directions will be 
found in the Lessons. 

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

3 teaspbons^l tablespoon 2 pints^l quart 

16 tablespoons=l cup 4 quarts^ 1 gallon 

2 eups=l pint 1 cup=8 ounces (volume) 

A gallon of water weighs 8% pounds — a cup of water, 8% ounces 
(avoirdupois). A gallon contains 231 cubic inches. 

All materials are measured level, i. e., by filling cup or spoon more 
than full and leveling with a case knife. This applies to liquids which 
"round up" in spoons. Flour, meal, and fine sugar are measured 
after sifting and piled into the measure lightly. Standard measuring 
cups holding V2 pint should always be used. Tea and coffee cups vary 
so greatly that correct proportions can not be obtained by using them. 
Tea and tablespoons vary considerably. Standard tea and table- 
spoons should be used. 

APPEOXIMATE IMEAStniE OF ONE POUND 

2 cups mUk 2 5/6 cups granulated eornmeal 

2 cups butter 2 2/3 cups oatmeal 

2 cups chopped meat 6 cups rolled oats 

2 cups granulated sugar 4 1/3 cups rye meal 

2 2/3 cups brown sugar 1% cups rice 

2 2/3 cups powdered sugar 2 1/3 cups dry beans 

3% cups confectioners' sugar 4 1/3 cups coffee 

4 cups patent flour 8 large eggs 

4 cups entire wheat flour 9 medium eggs 

4% cups Graham flour 10 small eggs 

APPEOXIMATE MEASURE OF ONE OUNCE 

Read "tablespoons" in place of cups in the above and the weight 
is about 1 ounce. 



iv LESSONS IN COOKING 

No table of weights to measure can be more than ap- 
proximate, as different samples vary in weight for bulk. 
In truly scientific cookery quantities should be measured 
by weight. The table is useful for comparison, i. e., pow- 
dered sugar is more bulky than granulated and less so than 
confectioners', hence the greater sweetening power of gran- 
ulated; ordinary white flour (sifted) is less bulky than 
graham flour, and so on. 

Experiments have shown that there may be a difference 
of 25 per cent in the weight of a "cup of flour" measured 
by different persons in different ways. One method is to 
sift the flour onto a square of glazed paper (or oil cloth) 
and pour it into the cup placed on another piece of paper — 
tap the side of the cup once with a knife and level. 

METHODS OF APPLYING HEAT 

Broiling — Cooking before or over glowing coals or under gas. Ra- 
diant heat. High temperature at first to sear outside, thus devel- 
oping flavor and retaining juices ; then lower temperature for the 
heat to penetrate and to avoid burning. 

Pan Broiling — Cooking on very hot griddle with only sufficient fat- 
to prevent sticking. 

EoASTiNG — Same as broiling, superseded by baking in oven. 

Baking — Cooking in oven by heated air and radiation. 
Slow oven, 270°— 350° F. 
Moderate oven, 350° — 400° F. 
Quick oven, 400° — 480° P. 

(These temperatures were taken by a thermometer through the 
top of a gas stove oven). 

Boiling — Cooking in boiling water, 212° F. 

Stewing — Cooking m water at temperature 160° to 180° F. 

Steaming — Cooking in contact with steam, 212° F. 

Dry Steaming, as in a double boiler, 192° F. 

Feting — Cooking by immersion in deep fat, approximately 360° F. 
for uncooked foods, 380° F. for cooked foods. The fat used- all 
lard, 2/3 lard and 1/3 beef suet, "cod fat" from the flank of 
beef, oil, "snowdrift," "eottolene" and mixtures. Tempera- 
tures vary to produce similar effects with different fats. 

Saute-ing— Cooking in small quantity of fat — often called frying. 

Braising — Combination of stewing and baking. Meat is often first 
seared to develop flavor and prevent escape of juices. 

Feicasseeinq — Combination of santeing and stewing. 



TABLES AND DMFINIIIONS 



COMPOSITION OF RAW FOODS 



Parts in 100 (approximate). 
Wheat Flour — 12 water, 12 gluten, 75 starch, 1 fat, 
Cornmeal — 12 water, 9 protein, 75 starch, 2 fat. 
Beans and Peas, dry — 13 water, 24 legumen, 60 starch, 2 fat. 
Potato, white — 78 water, 2 protein, 18 starch, trace of fat. 
Parsnips, Carrots, Turnips — 85 water, 1 proteid substance, 9 — 12 

starch and sugar, % fat. 
Banana — 75 water, 1 protein, 22 sugar and starch, % fat. 
Loin of Beef (avg.)— 60 water, 18 protein, 20 fat. 
Eggs — Ji water, 13 albumen, 10 fat. 
Egg, white — 86 water, 12 albumen, no fat. 
Egg, yolk — 50 water, 16 albumen, 33 fat. 
Milk — 87 water, 3 casein, 5 sugar, 4 fat. 
Cheese — 33 water 26 casein, 33 fat. 
Nuts — 3 water, 20 protein, 15 starch, 55 fat. 
Butter — 12 water, 1 protein, 85 fat. 
Lard, Olive Oil— 100 fat. 

All the above foods except refined fats, sugar and starch, contain 
from y2 per cent to 1 per cent of mineral matter (salts), apparent 
when the foods are burned as eish. Butter and cheese have 2 per cent 
or 3 per cent of common salt added. 

Protein foods are eggs, meats, fish, cheese. 

Starchy foods are the grains — wheat, rice, rye, oats, com, 
etc., beans, peas, potatoes, chestnut. 

Fats are prominent in fat meats, nuts, cream, butter, lard, 
vegetable oils. 

Cellulose or woody fiber is found in vegetables, un- 
screened flours and meals, and in fruits, especially when 
unripe. 

EFFECT OF HEAT ON FOOD MATERIALS 

Starch absorbs water, swells and becomes partially soluble 
in water. This begins at about 150 degrees F. Dry 
starch begins to change to dextrine at about 320 de- 
grees F. 

Sugar is not changed at low temperatures unless acid is 
present. It melts at about 365 degrees and begins to 
caramelize at about 420 degrees F. Sugar, boiled with 
acid, changes slowly to glucose or non-crystallizing 
sugar. 

Cellulose itself is not affected by cooking, but the con- 
necting substances are softened and it may be sepa- 
rated. 



»i LESSONS IN COOKING 

Protein foods are hardened somewhat by heat. Albumen 
coagulates completely at i6o degrees F. and will no 
longer dissolve in water. Other proteins, as gluten 
of flour, casein of milk, legumen of peas and beans, 
myosin of meat, are hardened somewhat. 
Gelatin is formed from gristle and connecting tissue of 
meat, and from bones, by long continued heating in 
the presence of water. 
Fat is not changed except at a high temperature, when it is 
broken apart — "split" — into fatty acid and glycerine. 
Some of the glycerine is changed into "acrolein" at 
very high temperatures, 500° and over, which is very 
irritating to the mucous membrane, as is recognized by 
the smarting sensation given to the eyes and nose when 
fats are overheated. Butter begins to "split" at about 
256°. F., lard at 360" F., beef suet at 440° F., cbttolene 
and snow drift at 450° F., especially prepared cotton- 
seed oil and olive oil at 600° F. 
Baking Powder, a mixture of cooking soda and an acid 
substance, as cream of tartar, or phosphates, or alum, 
undergoes chemical change, whereby carbon dioxide 
is set free and salts — as Rochelle salts, or phosphate, 
or alumina compounds — are formed. The heat of the 
oven expands the air or gas in the food, evaporates 
part of the water and drives out volatile substances 
like alcohol. 
All these changes are, for the most part, physical rather 
than chemical in their nature. For example, in a cake after 
baking, the sugar is still sugar, the starcn is still starch, the 
fat is still fat, and the albumen is still albumen. All the 
materials have been blended, flavors having been developed 
through minor but complex chemical changes and a small 
proportion of the starch and sugar in the crust have been 
changed to dextrin and caramel. 

TEMPEEATUEE AND TIME OF COOKING 

All food materials are poor conductors of heat — it takes 
time for the heat to penetrate. 
The correct time and temperature depends on (i) what 



TABLES AND DEFINITIONS vii 

is to be accomplished, (2) size and thicknesses, i. e., the 
extent of surface exposed to the heat, compared to the bulk. 

Foods with a large proportion of eggs require low tem- 
perature to prevent toughening. 

Starch requires nearly the temperature of boiling water 
for cooking. 

No food containing much water can be raised to a tem- 
perature above the boiling point— 212 degrees F. Water 
g;ives off vapor at all temperatures, but at 212 degrees F. 
steam forms rapidly and in so doing absorbs a large quan- 
tity of heat. No brown crust can be formed until the wa- 
ter from the surface is nearly all evaporated. A full oven 
in which much water vapor is being given off requires the 
application of more heat than when only one or two dishes 
are in it. 

In baking doughs, the larger the mass the lower must be 
the temperature in order that the heat may have time to 
penetrate to the interior and expand the gas and harden 
the albumen and gluten. If the temperature is too high 
at first, a crust forms, preventing the proper expansion of 
the loaf and hindering the penetration of the heat. 

Thin loaves, pieces of meat, etc., need much less time for 
cooking, because the heat penetrates quickly. Higher tem- 
peratures may be used, as the food is cooked before the 
surface begins to be burned. 

Mixtures containing much sugar or molasses burn easily. 

Vegetables containing much fiber need long boiling to 
soften them and separate the cellulose. Young, green vege- 
tables contain less fiber and require less time in cooking. 

Bearing all the above in mind, the following tables may 
serve as a general guide for beginners. When it is possible 
to do so, TEST.

PBOCESSES IN COOKING ix 

In addition to the methods of processes of applying heat, 
there are a few fundamental processes in cooking, i. e., 
thickening, leavening, shortening and flavoring. 

THICKENING AGENTS 

_ The common thickening agents are flour, corn starch, 
rice flour, potato flour, arrow root, eggs; also gelatin, sea 
rnoss, junket for milk, and pectin of unripe fruits stiffen 
liquids on cooling. 

Proportions 

One level tablespoon of flour will thicken one cup of 
liquid for soups. 

Two level tablespoons of flour will thicken one cup of 
drippings or other liquid for gravies and sauces. 

Three level tablespoons of browned flour will thicken one 
cup of liquid for gravy. 

The thickening power of corn starch is about twice that 
of flour. 

Four level tablespoons of corn starch will stiffen about 
one pint of liquid, as in corn starch pudding. 

Two good sized eggs to one pint of milk make a custard — 
one egg to a cup for soft custard or baked cup custard; 
three eggs to a pint of milk for a large mold custard. 

One level tablespoon of granulated gelatin will stiffen 
about one pint of liquid, if cooled on ice. 

LEAVENING AGENTS 

Doughs are made light or porous in the following ^ays : 

(a) By the production (and expansion by heat) of car- 

bon dioxide gas from the combination of baking 
soda with some acid substance. 

(b) From carbon dioxide gas produced by the growth 

of yeast — a microscopic plant. 

(c) From the expansion of entangled air, incorporated 

in the dough by means of (i) beating batters; 
(2) folding thick doughs; (3) beating air into 
eggs, especially the whites — then folding them 
into the mixture, 
(d) From the expansion of water to steam. 



Z LBSSONS IN COOKING 

Proportions 

Use two level teaspoons baking powder to one cup of 
flour. 

Use one teaspoon less of baking powder for each egg 
added after two have been used. 

Use one-half teaspoon soda with one and a quarter tea- 
spoon cream of tartar. 

Use one-half teaspoon soda with one cup sour milk. 

Use one-half teaspoon soda with one-half cup molasses. 

Two teaspoons baking powder are equivalent to one-half 
teaspoon soda in the above combinations. 

The yeast plant grows best at 75 to 90 degrees F. It 
changes sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. Flour 
contains a small proportion of sugar and during bread mak- 
ing some of the starch is changed into sugar, but the yeast 
begins to act more quickly if a little sugar or glucose is 
added at first. Salt and fats in quantity hinder the growth 
of the yeast. Low temperatures stop the growth almost 
completely; high temperatures kill the plant. 

When eggs are used as leavening agents, the whites are 
beaten separately, as they will hold much more air than 
the yolks, and folded into the mixture the last thing, break- 
ing as few air cells as possible. 

When air is depended on for leavening agent, all mate- 
rials are kept as cold as possible. Cold air expands more 
on heating than warm air. In pastry making, heat also 
melts the fat, so that the dough cannot be handled. 

SHORTENING 

Fats are added to doughs to make the product brittle — 
friable — "short," and to enrich the mixture. The fat coun- 
teracts the adhesive properties of the gluten and starch 
in flour. 

Pastry flours contain less gluten than bread flours and 
so require less shortening. 

Butter and oleomargarine contain about one-eighth water 
and salt, and thus have less shortening powers than lard, 
drippings, snowdrift, cottolene, etc., which contain no water. 

Proportions 

Two cups of flour (eight ounces) made into puff paste 
requires eight ounces (one cup) of shortening. 



PBOCBSSEH IN COOKING xi 

Two cups of flour in ordinary pie crust requires four 
ounces (one-half cup) of shortening. 

Two cups of flour in cookies requires four ounces (one- 
half cup) of shortening, or less. 

Two cups of flour in cake requires about three ounces of 
shortening. 

Two cups of flour in short cake requires two ounces (one- 
fourth cup) of shortening, or more. 

Two cups of flour in tea biscuits requires one-half to one 
ounce (one to two tablespoons) or more of shortening. 

In yeast doughs less shortening is used — from one-half 
to an ounce to two cups of flour. The tenacity of the 
gluten is required to hold the carbon dioxide gas slowly 
formed by the yeast, hence too much shortening prevents 
proper rising. 

Shortening for batters may be melted and mixed in, but 
in doughs which are to be rolled — ^pastry, cookies, short 
cake, biscuit, etc. — the fat should be cold and hard and cut 
into the flour with a knife, or rubbed in with the tips of the 
fingers. 

FLAVORING 

The flavoring materials most commonly used are salt, 
sugar, spices and extracts. The fine art of cookery con- 
sists of developing the full natural flavor of the foods them- 
selves and in combining them in pleasing ways. 

The amount of salt to be used depends, in general, on the 
total volume of the food. When food tastes salty, too much 
has been used. A safe proportion is one teaspoon salt to 
one quart of liquid in soups, sauces, or to one quart of 
flour in doughs, and for cereals one teaspoon to each pint 
of water used. When the flavors are delicate, somewhat 
less- salt is used, and with strong flavors, somewhat more. 
Cakes in which much salt butter is used do not need more 
salt. 

The quantity of sugar to be used depends on the taste 
desired. Foods served frozen need more sweetening than 
when at ordinary temperatures. On the other hand, foods 
that are served warm taste somewhat sweeter than when at 
ordinary temperature. 



xii LESSONS IN COOKING 

FOOD PRINCIPLES 

The nutritive part of foods or "food principles" are the pro- 
teins,' fats, carbohydrates, water and salt. 

Proteins contain nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and 
sometimes phosphorus and sulphur. They make up the greater part 
of the muscles and organs of the body and are needed in food for 
the growth and repair of body tissue. Proteins are also used by 
the body as "fuel" to keep the body warm and give muscle and 
other kinds of energy or power. 

The proteins make up a considerable proportion of meat, eggs, 
■cheese, skim milk, beans, peas and nuts, and are present in lesser 
proportion in all food products except the pure fats, sugars and 
starches. 

Fats contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen only. The fats and 
oils are concentrated fuel foods and yield to the body 2% times the 
heat and energy given by like weights of dry protein or starch or 
sugar. 

Carbohydrates or starch, sugar and a few gums and substances 
like them contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen only. The hydrogen 
and oxygen are in the same proportion as is found in water, hence 
the name carbo-hydrates. Cellulose or woody fibre is also a carbohy- 
drate, but as it is not digestible it is not a food for man. 

The carbohydrates, like the fats, are fuel foods and yield warmth 
and the power to do the work to the body when oxidized by the air 
brought in by the lungs. 

Excess of food over the requirements of the body, if digested, 
is stored as fatty tissue for use, if need be, as fuel. 

Water is needed for the fluids of the body, to carry away wastes 
and to regulate the temperature through perspiration. 

Salts are needed in the formation of bones, digestive fluids and 
as a small but necessary part of every living cell in the body, they 
are present in nearly all foods, being mpst abundant in vegetables, 
fruits, milk and eggs. 

FOOD UNITS 

As the unit of weight is the pound so the unit of food value 
is the "calorie." This is really a heat unit and is the quantity of 
heat required to raise the temperature of a kilogram of water 1° 
Centigrade, or approximately to raise the temperature of one pound 
of water 4° F. An ounce of dry protein, starch or sugar gives to 
the body 116 calories and an ounce of fat produces 264 calories.

A LESSON IN MEASUKINC 
Correct Method of Measuring, ()ne ITnlf and One Qtinrti' 
Sbown on tbe Table. 



LESSONS IN COOKING 

THE art of cookery is as old as history ; its development 
measures the development of civilization. More people 
are engaged in cooking all or a part of their time than 
in any other occupation. On the selection and preparation 
of food depends, more than on any single factor, the health 
and consequent happiness and prosperity of mankind. 

Cookery is, or should be, a fine art. Like other arts, it 
has its laws of proportion, harmony and contrast. The art 
of cookery appeals to the sense of taste, music to the sense of 
hearing, and the graphic arts to the sense of sight. Gratifica- 
tion of the sense of taste is as legitimate as enjoyment from 
any of the senses. The temperate indulgence of the sense 
of taste is indeed necessary for good digestion, on which 
depend physical well-being and efficiency. A systematic 
study of cooking, then, should be a fundamental part of the 
education of the home-maker. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

1. Have the kitchen arranged so that utensils and food 
materials are close at hand. A cabinet, shelves, or hooks 
for small utensils — measuring cups, spoons, knives, forks 
and egg beaters ; and cooking materials — salt, pepper, spices, 
baking powder, soda, sugar, etc., can be placed conveniently 
in any kitchen. 

2. Clean up as you go along. Put things away imme- 
diately after use. Make use of as few mixing and cooking 
dishes as possible by ringing or washing and using again. 
Put to soak in water dishes that cannot be cleansed easily. 
Do not make half an hour's dishwashing in preparing a 
meal. Work neatly — do not "clutter up" the kitchen. 

3. Before beginning to cook, make sure that hand? and 
nails are perfectly clean and the hair neatly dressed. 

4. If you cannot remember the recipes, copy them on a 
slip of paper, or, better, on cards perforated so that they 
may be hung on a convenient hook. Preserve the cards in 
an alphabetical card file for future use. 

5. All measurements are level. Sift flour before 
measuring. 3 teaspoons = i tablespoon ; 16 tablespoons = 
I cup ; 2 cups = I pint. 



10 LESSONS IN COOKING 

The directions for preparing the meals are based, for the 
most part, on the use of gas as fuel. They apply, as well, to 
gasoline and blue-flame oil stoves, except that these are 
usually a little slower in action. When a coal range is used, 
more time must be allowed for preparing meals, unless the 
fire is in proper condition. If hard coal is the fuel, it is 
desirable to have coke or charcoal and wood on hand, to 
obtain quick heat when the fire is low. The inexpensive 
lamp oil stove may be used in connection with a coal stove 
to save time. 

SETTING THE TABLE 

Have the tablecloth of correct size to hang well at the ends 
and sides of the table. Put on the silence cloth smoothly. 
Lay tablecloth with the crease exactly in the middle of the 
table. Breakfast and luncheon are often served on the bare 
table with doilies or mats under plates, glass and serving 
dishes. 

Arrange plates an even distance apart around the table, 
right side up, one inch from edge of table. 

Place knife at the right, sharp edge towards the plate. 
Fork at the left, tines up. Spoon or spoons beside the knife, 
bowl up. Napkin neatly folded or in ring beside the fork. 

Place tumbler at the right, opposite the farther edge of 
plate. Bread and butter plate or butter plate at the left, in 
line with tumbler. 

Be sure that all the required serving spoons, knives and 
forks are on the table or are put on when dishes are served, 
together with required plates or saucers for each course. 

Be sure that all the "constants" are on — bread and butter, 
milk and water, sugar, salt and pepper and condiments, oil 
and vinegar as needed. Place inside the line of plates. 

The harmony of the meal should never be disturbed 
through forgetting required dishes, condiments, etc.

Dinner, page 415.)

Monday Lesson 1 

BREAKFAST 

OATMEAL CREAM AND SUGAR 

SOFT COOKED EGGS BUTTERED TOAST 

COFFEE 

Oatmeal 

Into the upper part of a double boiler put 2 cups of hot 
water with J4 teaspoon salt. Place directly over the flame 
or hot coals, and when the water is boiling, slowly stir into 
it ^ cup rolled oats. Let the mixture boil for a few 
moments, stirring occasionally, then set over hot water in 
the lower part of the boiler and cook for at least i hour, 
preferably 2 hours. 
Soft Cooked Eggs 

Put I quart of boiling water into a hot saucepan, gently 
lower 4 eggs into the water, and let stand, covered, on the 
back of the range, where the heat will be neither increased 
nor diminished, for 8 or 10 minutes. 

The albumen of eggs begins to harden or "coagulate" at 
a temperature of 134° F. ; between 160° and 180° it becomes 
white throughout, tender and jelly-like; it loses this con- 
sistency at about 200°, and at boiling temperature (212°) it 
becomes tough and less digestible. When the cold eggs 
are put into the boiling water the temperature is imme- 
diately lowered to about 180° F. Test this with a ther- 
mometer if you have one. 
Buttered Toast 

Cut stale bread into slices about ^ inch in thickness. 
With a gas stove, place them under the oven burners or 
arrange on a toaster fitted for a burner on top the stove. 
Turn the pieces often, so that they may be evenly browned. 

As soon as both sides have become a golden brown, butter, 
lay buttered sides together, and send to the table very hot. 

Note. — To keep toast, etc., hot on a gas stove, set plate 
or other serving dish on a hot burner, after the gas has 
been turned off, and cover with an inverted pan. 
Coffee 

In a coffee pot that has been well aired and well scalded, 
put twice as many level teaspoons of ground coffee as 
there are cups to be served ; add as many eggshells, washed 

11 



12 LESSONS IN COOKING 

before the eggs were broken, as there are cups to be served ; 
or part of the white of an egg may be used. Add i table- 
spoon cold water for each cup of liquid desired, and mix 
thoroughly; add the required number of cups of freshly 
boiling water, and let boil 5 minutes after boiling begins. 
Pour a little cold water, J^ cup, down the spout, and set the 
pot where it will keep hot, without simmering, for 10 min- 
utes. If at the end of that time for any reason the coffee 
cannot be served at once, pour the liquid from the grounds 
and keep hot. A pinch of salt helps the flavor. 
Preparing the Meal 

Start cooking the cereal for breakfast while getting dinner 
or washing the dishes the evening before. Let it cook until 
the evening work is done; remove from the heat, cover the 
double-boiler tightly, and let stand on range until next 
morning. If steam radiators are convenient, set the boiler 
on the radiator and it will keep hot all night. Or, better 
still, if you have a "fireless cooker," put the cereal in that. 

With a gas stove, light the gas under the cereal cooker 
the first thing. Next put on a kettle of water to heat. Grind 
and make the coffee and cut the bread for toast. 

Set the table, cut the butter, and fill cream pitchers. Start 
the eggs to cooking. Then toast the bread, butter it, and 
place the toast either in the oven or on top of a burner to 
keep hot while the cereal is being eaten. 

Serve the cereal in warm cereal bowls. Never put food 
supposed to be hot into cold dishes. 

By the time the cereal is eaten, the coffee, eggs and toast 
are ready to serve. Send the eggs to the table either all 
together, wrapped in a napkin and placed in a dish, or in 
individual egg cups.

CREAM OF PEA SOUP CROUTONS 

BREAD AND BUTTER COCOA 

Cream of Pea Soup 

To y2 can of peas add i teaspoon sug.ar, % teaspoon salt, 
I cup cold water, and i thin slice of onion. Simmer 20 
minutes and then rub through a puree sieve. 



SEPTEMBEB MENUS 13 

Melt I tablespoon butter, to it add i tablespoon flour, and 
rub to a smooth paste. Gradually to this add i cup hot 
milk and blend smoothly. Cook, stirring constantly, for 
several minutes and until the mixture thickens. 

Add the peas, a dash of pepper, heat thoroughly and serve. 
(Any fresh "leftover" or canned vegetables may be used thus.) 

Croutons 

Cut stale bread in slices from Ya to Yz inch thick; then 
cut into small cubes. Brown in the oven, taking care that 
they are turned frequently enough to brown them evenly. 
Cocoa 

Scald 3 cups of milk in a double-boiler ; mix well 2 table- 
spoons cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons sugar, i teaspoon corn- 
starch and % teaspoon salt in a saucepan and stir in grad- 
ually I cup boiling water and let boil 5 or 6 minutes ; turn 
the liquid into the hot milk and beat with a whisk or egg- 
beater 5 minutes. A scant teaspoon of vanilla added just 
before serving greatly improves the flavor. 

Serve with additional cream and sugar if desired, or 
with whipped cream, putting the cream in the cup and 
pouring the cocoa on it. 

In the above method of making cocoa the cornstarch gives 
a creamy consistency and the salt takes oif any flat taste. 

Preparing the Meal 

Start the peas to cooking for the cream of pea soup, and 
while they are simmering cut the bread for the croutons. 
Light the oven burners and put the croutons in a flat pan in 
the oven to dry out slowly. 

Next put the milk for the cocoa, and also the soup, in the 
double-boiler to heat, and while heating melt the butter and 
add the flour for thickening for the cream soup. Add the 
hot milk to this, and, when well blended, boil a few minutes 
and set over hot water, to continue cooking while the peas 
are rubbed through a sieve. Add the puree mixture to the 
thickened milk and let it cook while finishing the cocoa. 

Add hot water to the cocoa and sugar mixture, boil, and 
add to hot milk. Let cook a few minutes longer while 
cutting the bread and butter for luncheon. 

If you do not have a warming closet, fill the soup plates 



14 LESSONS IN COOKING 

and tureen with hot water, and when soup is ready to serve 
pour out the water, wipe the dishes, fill the tureen, and send 
with the hot plates to the table. 

At the same time fil'l the cups with hot water, so that they 
may be heating while the soup is being eaten. 

When ready for the cocoa, pour into a hot chocolate pot 
and serve at once.

Monday Lesson 3 

BROILED SIRLOIN STEAK 

MASHED POTATOES BREAD AND BUTTER 

ORANGE MARMALADE 

FLOATING ISLAND 

Broiled Beefsteak 

Wipe, trim ofif superfluous fat and bone; heat the broiler 
very hot, rub it over with a bit of fat, and lay the steak on it. 
At first have the gas turned on full force, to obtain the 
intense heat necessary to the first searing of the meat. Sear 
the steak first on one side, then the other, and when browned 
lower the flame and continue cooking. 

If you have no broiler, heat a skillet sizzling hot, rub 
over lightly with a piece of fat, and proceed as above. With 
a coal fire, cook in a wire broiler directly over the hot coals. 
Turn frequently until the surface is well browned on both 
sides, then move away from the fire to finish. 

For a steak i inch in thickness, 5 to 8 minutes are 
required for its proper broiling, unless it is desired that it 
be well cooked all the way through, when 10 to 12 minutes 
will be required; For a steak ij^ inches thick, 8 to 10 
minutes are required. 

When done, remove to the serving dish, which should be 
hot, sprinkle with salt and a Httle pepper, and spread with 
butter if desired. Serve at once. If kept hot the cooking 
will continue too far. 

If desired, add a little hot water — yi cup or so — to the 
pan under the broiler rack, and when thoroughly mixed 
with the meat juices dropped from the steak, pour around 
the steak just before serving. If this is not desired, pour 
the liquid into a cup, to be used in soup or in gravies at 
some future time. Or a thickened gravy may be made. 



SEPTEMBEB MENUS 15 

Gravy 

Pour the drippings from the steak into a frying pan ; if 
necessary, add enough butter to make about 2 tablespoons 
and brown with 2 tablespoons flour ; pour about J^ cup boil- 
ing water into the dripping pan, thoroughly mix it with any 
juices that may be there, return to the cup and fill up With 
milk; gradually add to the browned flour and stir until it 
thickens ; serve. 

Mashed Potatoes 

Wash and pare 8 medium-sized potatoes of uniform size, 
cover with boiling salted water, and cook until tender when 
pierced with a fork. Water if just barely boiling is of the 
same temperature as when boiling, rapidly, hence do not 
keep the water on potatoes boiling furiously. 

When the potatoes are done pass them through a vege- 
table ricer or mash them with a potato masher until all the 
■ lumps are gone. Add 3 tablespoons of butter, yi teaspoon 
salt, and about J4 cup hot milk or cream. Beat the mixture 
until light and creamy, reheat, and send to the table piled 
lightly in a hot vegetable dish. 

Floating Island 

In a double-boiler place 3 cups of milk and put on the 
stove to heat. 

Separate the yolks and whites of 2 eggs and with the 
yolks and 2 whole, eggs beat J^ cup sugar and }i teaspoon 
salt until the mixture is creamy. 

When the milk is heated, add slowly to the egg mixture, 
stirring all the time until well blended. Return to the 
double-boiler and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture 
coats the bowl of the spoon. 

Remove from the fire, add i teaspoon vanilla, beat vigor- 
ously for a few minutes, then strain and cool. 

Beat the whites until stiff, add j4 cup sugar and beat until 
very stiff, flavoring with y^ teaspoon of vanilla. 

Serve the custard in sherbet cups, with the whites piled 
in a spiral on the top. This spiral shape may be easily 
made by turning the spoon in the hand as the white of egg 
is dropped into the cup. 



16 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Preparing the Meal 

The custard of the floating island should be made in the 
morning, so that it will be cold. 

About three-quarters of an hour before dinnertime, put 
on water for potatoes to heat, salting it. Wash and pare 
potatoes and put into the boiling water. 

Set the table. Prepare the white of egg for the pudding. 
Place the completed dessert in a cool place. 

Cut the bread and butter and place with water on the 
table. See that the steak knife and fork and salt and pepper 
are on the table. 

Note. — In hot weather do not put butter and water on 
the table until just before serving the meal. 

When the potatoes are about done, start the milk to 
heating, drain off water, mash, and add milk, butter and salt. 

Light the burners under the broiler. Put the mashed 
potatoes in the serving dish and place it in the oven to keep 
hot. If you have no warming closet, put the steak platter 
and plates in the upper part of the oven to get warm. Do 
not let them become hot, as this harms china by making it 
brittle. 

Broil the steak, watching it constantly. 

When the steak is cooked, place it on the heated platter 
and serve with the hot mashed potatoes immediately. 

While the steak is cooking, put to soak the kettle in which 
the potatoes were cooked and other dishes used in preparing 
meal not already washed. 

Remove the steak course from the table and serve the 
dessert.

thoroughly chill them for breakfast. In the morning cut 
them in two, scoop out the seeds, and serve. 
Cream of Wheat with Dates 

Follow the directions given for cooking oatmeal, using. 



SEPTEMBEB MENUS 17 

however, ^ cup Cream of Wheat to 2 cups boiling water. 
Care must be taken in stirring the cereal into the boiling 
water, that it does not lump. 

In the morning just before serving, stir into the cereal 
about 8 dates scalded and cut into small pieces, or sprinkle 
them over the top. 

Muffins 

Sift together 2 cups of flour, J4 teaspoon salt, 4 teaspoons 
baking powder, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

Beat an egg without separating until light; add i>4 cups 
milk, and stir at once into the dry ingredients. 

Add 2 tablespoons melted butter, beat thoroughly, and 
bake about 25 minutes in a hot, well-greased muffin pan in a 
moderately hot oven. 

CofFee 

Follow directions given in Lesson i. 

Preparing the Meal 

Light the gas' under the cereal, and put on a kettle of 
water to heat. 

Have the muffin pans, measuring cup, spoons, knife, flour, 
baking powder, etc., on the table before beginning to work. 
Now light the oven and proceed to make the muffins. 

When the muffins are in the oven, grind and make the 
cofifee; and while that is cooking, set the table, cut the 
butter, fill the cream pitchers. 

Now cut the dates and add to the cereal, and then halve 
the melons and remove the seeds. Put each half on a small 
plate and place on the table. 

As soon as the family have finished their melon, serve the 
cereal in hot cereal bowls. The bowls should have been 
filled with hot water before the serving of the melon, or 
else placed in a warm place to heat. It is not a good thing 
for dishes to be placed in a hot oven to heat. This dry heat 
renders the china very brittle and thus causes it to break 
very easily. 

By the time the cereal is eaten the m^uffins and cofifee will 
be done and ready to serve. Place the muffins on a hot plate 
and cover with a napkin. 

Be sure to put the cereal cooker to soak as soon as the

mashed potato. Bake in hot oven 20 minutes. 
Lemonade 

Use the juice of ^2 lemon for each glass of lemonade. 
Sweeten with 2 or 3 teaspoons sugar ; or — and this is much 
better — use sugar syrup for s ;i^eetening, as this mixes at 
once with the water. 

Preparing the Meal 

About yi hour before lunch-time light the oven burners, 
and prepare the cottage pie and place in oven. 

Next make the lemonade, using very cold water. 

Now see that the table is set, then turn out a glass of jelly 
into a jelly dish and place on the table. 

Cut the bread and butter, and by this time the pie is done 
and ready to serve.

COTTAGE PUDDING CHOCOLATE SAUCE 

Roast Veal 

After wiping the meat with a damp cloth, with tape or 
string bind it into a compact shape ; dredge with salt, pepper 
and flour. 

Put the meat into a hot oven; after 15 minutes' cooking, 
lower the heat, baste (that is, pour melted butter or other 
fat over the meat) frequently, and allow at least 20 minutes 
to the pound. Longer cooking is an advantage if the heat be 
gentle. 



SEPTEMBEB MENUS 19 

Gravy 

When the roast is done, remove from the pan to a hot 
platter and set in a warm place. In the dripping pan place 2 
tablespoons of flour and mix with the fat in the pan. If 
there is more than 2 or 3 tablespoons of fat, pour off some 
until the right amount is left. If there is less, add enough 
butter to make the correct proportion. 

Stir over the fire until the mixture is well browned, then 
slowly add 2 cups hot water or milk, or a combination of 
both. Soup stock also may be used. Stir until the gravy 
boils a few minutes, pour into a hot gravy boat and serve. 
Baked Potatoes 

Select potatoes of a uniform size ; wash them and with a 
vegetable brush scrub them well so that the skins will be 
perfectly clean. Then put them in a hot oven. Potatoes of 
medium size require from 45 to 60 minutes ; they are at their 
best as soon as they are soft throughout. On removal from 
the oven, break the skin to let the steam escape, lest the 
naturally dry, mealy potato become soggy from the quickly 
condensing steam. 

To make potatoes especially mealy, roll them in a napkin 
or towel between the hands until the pulp is loosened, then 
break the skin. 
Cottage Pudding 

Cream }i cup butter, add 5^ cup sugar and cream well. 
Beat I egg well, add to the sugar and butter. 

Mix and sift 2% cups flour, 4 teaspoons baking powder 
and >4 teaspoon salt. Add the flour alternately with i cup 
of milk to the sugar mixture. Add i teaspoon vanilla ani 
bake 35 minutes in a moderate oven. Or bake in muffm 
rings, forming individual puddings. 
Chocolate Sauce 

Mix J/2 cup sugar, i tablespoon cornstarch and % cuf 
grated chocolate; also >4 teaspoon salt. Gradually ad^^ I 
cup boiling water, stirring all the time. Boil 5 minutes. 

Remove from the fire, add i tabfespoon butter and I tok 
spoon vanilla. Serve with the pudding. 
Preparing the Meal 

About iy2 hours before dinnertime prepare the roast for 
Uie oven, first lighting the oven burners. After the meat 



20 LESSONS IN COOKING 

is in the oven prepare the potatoes for bailing and put 
them in the oven. 

Now get out the materials and make the pudding, allow- 
ing about 35 minutes for it to bake if put in one large pan, 
or 20 to 25 minutes if baked in individual rings. 

When the pudding is in the oven, wash the dishes used in 
its preparation, and then see that the table is completely set 
for dinner. 

Now make the chocolate sauce, and while that is cooking, 
cut the bread and butter and place on the table. 

Fill the vegetable dish, platter, and the dinner plates with 
hot water, or heat otherwise. 

Now put the hot baked potatoes into a serving dish and 
send to the table with the roast. 

By this time the pudding is done so the burners can be 
extinguished, but unless the pudding is already very brown 
it can be left in the oven until ready to serve. 

Be sure to fill the roasting pan with water before going to 
dinner; also, as soon as the pudding is served, put to soak 
the pudding pan and the vessel in which the sauce was 
cooked.

STEWED PRUNES OR FRESH FRUIT 

CORN FLAKES CREAM AND SUGAR 

FRENCH TOAST SYRUP COFFEE 

Stewed Prunes 

Wash the prunes well, cover with cold water, and soak 
over night. In the morning put them to cook in the water 
in which they were soaked, cooking very slowly below the 
boiling point. When the prunes are soft and almost done, 
add a little sugar if preferred. The long, slow cooking 
retains all the sugar that the fruit originally possessed, and 
makes additional sweetening unnecessary. 

French Toast 

Beat 2 eggs until light; to them add i teaspoon salt, a 
grating of nutmeg, and i pint of milk. Mix well together. 

Cut stale bread into slices % inch thick; dip the slices, 
one at a time, into the milk, and then place in a hot, well- 
buttered frying-pan. Brown on both sides and then serve

-sprinkled with powdered sugar, or with syrup, or plain with 
butter. 

Preparing the Meal 

Put on water to heat for the coffee. Dish the prunes 
which have previously been cooked and place at each plate 
at the table. 

Now grind and make the coffee. While it is cooking, beat 
the eggs and add the milk. Then cut the slices of stale 
bread for the French toast. 

Cut the butter and fill the cream pitchers and place on the 
table. Then fill cereal bowls with Corn Flakes. These may 
be placed on a small serving table in the dining room from 
which they can easily be served as soon as the fruit is 
finished. If not a fresh package, the Corn Flakes should be 
dried out in the oven. 

Fry the bread just before ready to serve. It is much 
better when freshly cooked. The coffee will be ready to 
serve by the time the bread is browned ; serve together, the 
cereal and fruit dishes having been removed.

If desired stronger, add more tea; do not steep longer. 
If too strong, add hot water. 

In preparing this meal, which should not take longer than 
20 minutes, first fill the tea-kettle and put it on the stove to 
heat. Then dice the potatoes, and while they are browning 
slice the meat. Now cut the bread and butter and make

PRUNE SOUFFLE 

Pan-Broiled Lamb Chops 

With a damp cloth wipe the lamb chops, and if the 
butcher has not already trimmed them, cut off any fat that 
is not perfectly white and clean. 

Now heat a frying-pan until it is smoking-hot; then 
quickly lay the chops in the pan and sear first on one side, 
then the other. When the chops are browned, lower the 
flame and cook 7 to 10 minutes, according to whether it is 
desired to have them rare or well done; also according to 
the thickness. Usually they are about i inch thick, however. 
Place on a hot platter, sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
spread with butter, or pour around them the fat in the pan. 

Creamed Peas 

Drain the liquor from J^ can of peas. In a saucepan 
melt 3 tablespoons butter; to this add 3 tablespoons flour 
and J4 teaspoon of salt ; when mixed to a smooth paste add 
gradually i^ cups of milk. Heat, stirring all the time; 
boil a few minutes; add the peas, and when thoroughly 
heated serye at once. 

(If peas were not used for Monday's luncheon substitute 
sliced tomatoes or other fresh vegetable in season.)

Prune Souffle 

Beat the whites of 3 eggs until stiff, cut and fold in J4 
cup prune pulp and J4 cup sugar, beat until light andi 
fluffy. Pour into a buttered baking dish and bake in a slov/; 
oven until firm. Or the souffle may be served without 
baking, a soft custard being usually poured over each! 
serving, in that case. 

Preparing the Meal 

The peas for this meal were left from Monday's luncheon 
and the prunes for the souffle from breakfast. 

Forty minutes before dinnertime wash and pare the pota- 
toes and put them on to cook in boiling salted water. While 
they are cooking beat the eggs for the souffle and add the 
prune pulp which has previously been prepared. When the 
souffle is done set in the oven in a pan of water, or if desired 
to serve without cooking place in a cool place until ready 
for it. 

Next make the cream sauce for the peas and after the peas 
have been added set over hot water to become thoroughly 
heated. 

Now put the frying pan on the stove and while it is heat- 
ing prepare the chops for broiling. 

As soon as the chops are brown and are cooking slowly 
cut the bread and butter and place on the table. Now 
drain the water from the potatoes and run through a 
vegetable ricer into a hot vegetable dish and send to the 
table. 

Transfer the chops to a hot chop plate and pour the peas 
into a serving dish. 

Remember to keep the dishes washed up as the work pro- 
ceeds and to fill each pan with water as soon as its contents 
have been removed. ' ^

water, freshly drawn, add 3^ teaspoon of salt and sprinkle 
in }i cup of rolled oats ; put the double boiler over the fire 
and cook for an hour or two without stirring; do this the 
night before and reheat before serving. 

The dissolved air in fresh water keeps flaked cereals light. 
Compare results with the ordinary method of cooking oat- 
meal as given in Lesson I and decide which you prefer. 
Baking-powder Biscuits 

Into a mixing bowl sift 2 cups of flour with 4 teaspoons 
baking powder and J4 teaspoon salt; with the tips of the

brown quickly on both sides, then lower the flame; add % 
cup broth or hot water and cook slowly for about 15 min- 
utes, or until the meat is tender. By this time the liquid will 
have evaporated and a thick brown gravy will be in the pan. 

Remove the meat to a hot platter, add 2 tablespoons flour 
to the liquid in the pan and when well browned add 2 cups 
milk, broth, hot water or a combination of any two or all 
three ; stir until the gravy boils, when it is ready to serve. 

Mashed Potatoes 

Follow directions given in Lesson 3. 
Sliced Tomatoes 

To peel tomatoes, potir boiling water over them, drain and 
peel. The skin will now slip easily off ; chill before slicing ; 
if there is not time to chill the tomatoes after peeling, do not 
pour the boiling water over them, but instead, with the dull 
blade of a knife go all over the surface of the tomato as if 
peeling it, but not, however, breaking the skin; now make 
an incision and the skin will slip off almost as easily as when 
hot water is used.

drain and mash the potatoes and set on the back of the 
range to keep warm until needed; transfer the meat to a 
hot platter and make the gravy. Serve the dinner at once. 

Unmold the mousse, which should have been made in the 
morning, just before serving; serve either plain or with 
cream or a soft custard. 
Cake for Sunday Evening 

In a mixing bowl cream J4 cup softened butter ; to it add 
^ cup sugar and beat until very creamy. To this mixture 
add alternately ^ cup water and i}^ cups flour, with which 
3 teaspoons baking powder has been sifted ; beat well. Now 
fold in the stiffly beaten whites of 3 eggs, left from the day 
before when the yolks were used for the salad dressing, and 
I teaspoon vanilla. 

By "folding" is meant the process by which the whites of 
eggs may be mixed in without the destruction and loss of 
air bubbles that have already been formed. To do this with 
a spoon, cut down to the bottom of the dish, turn, bring to 
the top and fold over the mixture thus brought to the sur- 
face; repeat the process until the ingredients are well 
blended. 

Bake the cake either in layers or in a loaf. It is very nice 
baked in a square pan so that a cake about 2 inches thick 
results. This then can be frosted and cut into 2-inch squares. 

To prepare a cake pan, first grease the pan, then cover 
with oiled paper the size of the pan ; sprinkle this with flour 
and then pour in the cake batter ; or if the paper is omitted, 
flour the pan after greasing. This cake requires about 15 
minutes in a moderate oven if baked in layers, or from 25 
to 30 if baked in a loaf. To test a cake insert a clean straw ; 
if it comes out clean the cake is done ; if it has anything ad- 
hering to it the cake must bake a longer time.

SEPTEMBER MENUS 37 

HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS 

Coffee Percolator 

A percolator has replaced the old-fashioned coffee-pot in 
many homes. The coffee should be ground very fine, as less 
is then required. It is best to pour the required amount of 
boiling water on the ground coffee and allow to percolate 
only a few minutes. If cold water is used the percolator 
begms to work much before the water reaches the boiling 
pointr-— Coffee, like tea, should be extracted with boiling 
water, otherwise more tannin is drawn out, which is harmful 
to flavor and digestion. 

A dash of salt added to coffee, and also to tea, will add to 
the flavor. 

Cocoa and Chocolate 

A very convenient and quick way of preparing cocoa and 
chocolate is to cook together a large quantity of the cocoa 
or chocolate (i cup), sugar (i cup), cornstarch (J4 cup), 
salt (i teaspoon), and water (2 cups) until smooth and 
glossy. Put into glass jars. When desired for use, take 
out quantity necessary (2 teaspoons to a cup) ; add the milk; 
heat, flavor, beat well, and serve. 
Marshmallows 

Marshmallows may be used in place of whipped cream in 
cocoa or chocolate. They melt and form a foamy covering, 
thus preventing the formation of the skin, which is un- 
desirable. 

Meringue 

Meringue, such as that used in the Floating Island, may 
be cooked by heating j4 cup milk in a flat pan set over hot 
water. When scalding, drop the meringue by spoonfuls on 
top, cover, and let cook 5 minutes. When the meringue is 
cooked the proportion of sugar is decreased, using but i 
tablespoon to i egg-white. 

This process may be used any time when baking is not 
feasible. 

Sweetening Iced Beverages 

Since sugar does not dissolve readily in cold fruit juice, 
cold tea, etc., it is very convenient to use sugar syrup instead. 



38 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Make it in quantity, one part sugar to one of water, and 
keep in tight jars ready for use when needed. 

Substitution for Cornstarch 

If desired to use flour instead of cornstarch in making 
Blanc Mange, etc., use double the quantity, as flour has only 
half the thickening power of cornstarch. Potato starch, 
rice flour and arrow root also can be substituted. 
Poaching Eggs 

Milk may be substituted for water in poaching eggs. 
The result is not only very delicious, but also possesses an 
increased food value. When poaching in milk, always set 
the poaching pan over hot water. 

Boiled Frosting 

Boiled frosting may be kept from hardening too rapidly 
by the following process: When the syrup drops thick like 
honey (230° F.) add 5 tablespoons to the white of i large 
egg, \yell beaten. Beat v/ell. Cook the remainder of the 
syrup to the soft ball stage (238° F.), then add to the egg 
and syrup mixture. 

White Sauce 

There are three kinds of White Sauce generally used — 
thin, medium, and thick. The Thin is used, for scalloped 
dishes, cream soups, cream toast, etc. The Medium is used 
for cream.ed vegetables, fish, etc., and the Thick for making 
croquettes and souffles. 

For Thin White Sauce use i tablespoon flour to 2 
tablespoons butter and i cup milk. 

For Medium White Sauce use 2 tablespoons flour, 2 
tablespoons butter and i cup milk. 

For Thick White Sauce use 4 tablespoons flour to 3 
tablespoons butter, and i cup milk

LESSONS IN COOKING 



SUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING THE COST OF 
THE SEPTEMBER MENUS 

Substitute oleomargarine for butter in cooking. Use 
top of milk in place of cream for cereal and coffee. In cook- 
ing with milk reduce by adding half water, or use skimmed 
milk at cents per quart. 

In Lesson i, omit the soft cooked eggs and in Lesson 3 
use ground round steak broiled in place of sirloin. In 
Lesson 4 omit the cantaloupe and in Lesson 6 use 2 pounds 
veal chops in place of 4 pounds veal roast. In Lesson 7 
omit the cereal, and in Lesson 9 use plain cooked peas 
instead of creamed. In Lesson 11 use tea instead of milk, 
and in Lesson 12 use clear tomato soup instead of cream 
of tomato. In Lesson 32 use boiled beef patties, grinding 
round steak for this and forming into patties, instead of 
veal cutlets, and in Lesson 20 use cucumber salad instead 
of fruit salad.

OCTOBER MENUS 



LESSONS IN COOKING 



PART II 
WAITING ON TABLE 



General Rule 

Convenience, ease and grace should govern every action 
in serving. This rule should apply to the setting of the ■ 
table, taking each point into consideration in the placing of 
every article, as well as in the serving. 

With a Maid 

1. A tray should be used in serving food and removing 
dishes, with the exception of platters and large dishes. ' 

2. Place dishes before the guests from the right. 

3. Pass all dishes from which food is to be taken at 
the left. 

4. Remove the dishes from the right, when convenient^ 

5. Fill water glasses as they stand in place, if possible. 
■If not, pick up the glass with the left hand, fill and replace. 

6. Everything pertaining , to one course should be re- 
moved before serving the next. 

7. Remove in the following order: 

1. All dishes containing food, meat platter, vege- 

table dishes, etc. In removing Tthe platter, 
lay the carving knife and fork on the platter 
and remove with both hands. 

2. Soiled dishes, taking the entire service from 

each person at one time. 

3. Clean dishes that are not to be used in the 

following courses. 
41 



42 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Remove the crumbs before serving the dessert. For this 
use a scraper and tray when a tablecloth is used or napkin 
and plate when meal is served from the polished table. 
. Serve finger bowls whenever required, i. e., after fruit 
course for breakfast, ' after the meat course if vegetables 
such as corn on the cob is served and corn holders are not 
provided, and at the end of the meal. 

Without a Maid 

1. Place a double-decker service table or wheel tray near 
the dining table. 

2. Have everything possible in reserve on the service 
table. Even many of the dishes to be served hot may be 
kept there standing in hot water. 

3. Soiled dishes from one course may be removed and 
set on the lower shelf of the service table if desired. 

4. Make the service as simple as possible, planning in 
every way to avoid leaving the table and interruption of 
the meal. 

5. Finger bowls may be put on the table and left there 
for' use during the entire meal. 

6. Serve as much of the food as possible at the table. 
Individual service — ^that is, preparing in single portions — 
is very attractive, but requires more work. 

7. For a small family it is often advisable to serve the 
entire meal from the kitchen, serving portions suited to each 
individual. This lessens dishwashing, because no serving 
dishes are needed.

Cottage Cheese 

Heat thick sour milk over hot water until the curd and 
whey separate. This is accompHshed at a low temperature, 
and for tender cheese the temperature should not go over 
ioo° F. 

Pour into a sieve, rinse if desired until all sour taste is 
removed, and let stand several hours, or until all the whey 
has drained off. Add salt, pepper and melted butter, form 
into balls and serve cold. 

Preparing the Meal 

Twenty minutes before lunch time prepare the scalloped 
tomatoes. While baking mold the cottage cheese, which 
should have been made in the morning, or even the preceding 
day, into balls and arrange on lettuce leaves. Make the tea 
and serve the meal. 

While preparing this meal make the blackberry sponge for 
dinner.

Saturday Morning Baking 

The following dishes for Saturday and Sunday meals 
should be prepared in the order given. 

Coffee Cake 

To I c scalded milk add j/s c butter, or butter and lard, 
}i c sugar, and J^ t salt. When lukewarm, add J^ yeast 
cake dissolved in J^ c lukewarm water, i egg well beaten, 
flour enough to make a stiff batter and yi c raisins, scalded 
and cut into small pieces. Cover, let rise over night ; in the 
morning work down well by stirring with a wooden spoon. 
Turn out onto a floured board, pat or roll into a sheet about 
^ inch thick, put into a shallow pan, brush over with beaten 
egg and spread with a mixture made of 3 T melted butter, 
ys c sugar, and i t cinnamon. When the sugar is partially 
melted, sift on 3 T flour. 

Place the Coffee Cake in a warm place until double in 
bulk, then bake yi h or longer, until done. 

If desired, this process may be started in the morning, 
but in this case i whole yeast cake must be used. Then 
proceed as above. 

Cheese Crumpets 

Scald 2 c milk in a double boiler; to ji c melted butter 
add j4 c cornstarch, }i c flour and yi t salt; mix v/ell and 
add to scalded milk. Cook 5 m, stirring constantly. Add 
the yolks of 2 eggs slightly beaten and yi c cheese, cut into 
small pieces. When the cheese is melted, pour into a buttered 
shallow pan and cool. Turn onto a board, cut into squares, 
place on a pan, sprinkle with y^ c grated cheese and brown 
in the oven. Serve on crackers. 

Drop Cakes 

Cream }i c butter, add i c sugar ; mix well, add the yolks 
of 2 eggs and when well beaten into the sugar, add i>4 c 
flour, sifted with 3 t baking powder, alternately with ^ c

milk. Lastly cut and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the 
2 eggs and 1 1 vanilla. 

Drop from a spoon into greased muffin rings and bake 
about 15 m in a moderate oven. Frost if desired. 
Caramel Custard 

Heat I quart of milk in a double boiler ; while this is heat- 
ing, caramelize ^ c sugar by boiling with J4 c water until 
golden brown in color. Then pour slowly into the hot milk, 
stir and cook until thoroughly dissolved. The high tempera- 
ture of the syrup will raise that of the heated milk, causing 
violent boiling. Hence, care is necessary in combining the 
two. Now proceed according to directions given in Lesson 
12 for Baked Custard, using 4 eggs, % t salt, but no sugar. 
Nut Blanc Mange 

See Lesson 15, adding i c finely chopped nut meats just 
before molding. English walnuts, pecans, almonds, etc., are 
all good. 
Apple Sauce 

Pare, quarter and core 6 tart, juicy apples ; add J4 c wa- 
ter and cook until tender, having a hot fire so that the ap- 
ples may be cooked quickly. Add a few grains of salt, 
sweeten to taste and cook enough longer to dissolve the 
sugar. 

Chocolate Sauce, see Lesson 6. 
Salad Dressing, see Lesson IS. 

Method of Work 

Immediately after breakfast, work down the Cofifee Cake 
if started the preceding evening, arrange in the pans with 
the sugar mixture and stand in a warm place to rise. If 
not already started, make the sponge with a whole yeast 
cake and set away in a warm place for the first rising. It 
should be kept especially warm, between 80° and 90° 
F, if started in the morning. 

While the Cofifee Cake is rising, which will take between 
I and 2 h, according to the time of starting the dough, make 
the Cheese Crumpets and set aside to cool. 

Start the sugar to caramelizing and the milk to heating 
for the Custard and Blanc Mange, and then make the Drop 
Cakes. Place in the oven and finish the Custard, reserving 



OCTOBER MENUS 57 

some of the milk for the Blanc Mange. By this time the 
Coffee Cake, if started by the long process, is ready to be 
baked. Also the Custard, set in a pan of water, may be 
put into the oven if there is room. If not, let it wait until 
the cakes are done. . , 

Now finish the Blanc Mange and while it is cooking make 
the Apple Sauce. When finished, make the Chocolate Sauce 
and, if necessary, a supply of Salad Dressing. 

The Coffee Cake, if started by the short process, should 
now be baked. It should be worked down and put in the 
pans after making the Drop Cakes and before making the 
Custard.

OCTOBER MENUS 61 

HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS 
Nutmeg as a Flavoring 

A dash of nutmeg added to creamed toast improves it 
greatly. It also gives to vegetables, such as beans, peas, 
potatoes, rice, etc., a very delicate flavor. To roast veal and 
lamb it gives a delicious flavor obtained in no other way. 
Cottage Cheese 

A pleasing variety can be obtained by serving cottage 
cheese in diflferent ways. Seasoning with salt and pepper 
and softening with cream is the usual method. Instead of 
the cream add enough melted butter to soften and hold to- 
getlier, so that it may be rolled into balls. Sprinkle with 
chopped parsley and serve. Or roll them in breadcrumbs, 
brown in butter and serve hot. Or serve as a cheese tart 
in pastry shell with cream and sugar. 
Whipped Cream vyith Soup 

All cream soups are very delicious served with whipped 
cream. Put i t cream in the bottom of the bowl and pour 
the hot soup on it. 
Crapefruit 

When grapefruit is prepared and allowed to stand over 
night the bitter taste develops. If this is undesirable, pre- 
pare shortly before using. 

Sweetening with honey instead of sugar gives a very de- 
licious flavor to grapefruit. All kinds of preserved small 
fruits, maple syrup and fresh crushed fruits may also be 
used in grapefruit. 
Nuts 

The' housewife with foresight will have on hand jars of 
nuts ready to use for salaJs, desserts, etc. English walnuts, 
pecans, and other nuts, when shelled should be kept in two 
jars, the whole perfect pieces in one and the broken in an- 
other. If nuts are bought shelled they should be scalded 
and dried in the oven, because they are not shelled in sani- 
tary surroundings. 

Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water on 
them. Allow them to stand about 5 m, drain from the wa- 
ter and slip off the brown skin. Dry thoroughly and keep in 
jars. 



62 LESSONS IN COOKING 

To shred almonds, lay flat on the table and cut lengthwise. 
These shredded almonds, browned but not salted, are a great 
addition to many desserts, both in appearance and taste. 
Salad Dressing 

Salad Dressing made up in quantity without milk will 
keep indefinitely. Make very thick, using only the vinegar 
or the lemon juice; put in glass jars. Take out the quantity 
desired, dilute with sweet or sour milk or cream, whipped 
cream or unsweetened evaporated milk. 
Cream Soups 

The foundation for all cream soups is the thin white 
sauce. To this is added the pulp of different kinds of vege- 
tables, such as potatoes, tomatoes, peas, beans, celery, pump- 
kin, lettuce, onion, etc., and such cereals as barley, rice and 
sago. 

A general proportion that can always be used is i quart 
liquid, I pint vegetable pulp and 2 T flour. The amount of 
butter should vary according to the richness desired. 
Scalloped Dishes 

Scalloped dishes are prepared by baking in the oven with 
a top layer of buttered crumbs. The foundation of a scal- 
loped dish may be fish, meat, vegetables, macaroni, etc., with 
generally a sauce or gravy poured over and the top covered 
with crumbs. 

Tomatoes or any soft vegetables are prepared without the 
sauce, and some crumbs are generally mixed throughout the 
dish. 

Scalloped dishes are served in the dish in which they 
are baked. 
Bread Crumbs 

Bread crumbs should be prepared and kept in jars ready 
for use. Dry all pieces of bread, crusts, etc., by keeping in 
open jars or receptacles set in a warm dry place. When 
thoroughly dried, roll fine or put through a meat grinder 
and keep in glass jars. 

The bread may be dried in the oven at a low temperature 
and ground when desired for immediate use. 
Buttered Crumbs 

Buttered crumbs are prepared by melting butter and mix- 
ing the crumbs with it in the proportion of about I T butter 
to 4 T crumbs.

The average October Menu, then, yields 2975 Food Units or Calories 
per person per day, which is a liberal diet for a man of average size. 

Of the Average Total Food Value, 12% is in the form of Protein, 
37% in Fat and 51% in Carbohydrate, or starches, sugars, gums, etc. 

The Average Cost per Person per Day is $ 

Note that the October Menus are calculated for each day and that 
the method is different from that used in Part I. This method is the 
older and more commonly used method. It requires more figuring than 
the method used in Paet I. The results by either method should be the 
same. For tables and further details of method used in Part I, devised 
by Dr. Fisher, see Bulletin of the School, ''Food Values," price 10 cents. 
For tables of composition by weight, used in Part II, send 10 cents (coin) 
to tj. S. Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C, for Bulletin 
No, 28, "Composition of American Food Materials." 

In Part III will be found calculations of separate meals by the 
Fisher percentage by food value method. 

Note, — Costs are omitted because prices are now chang-ing so 
rapidly and vary so much in different parts of the country.

iqofiTE__-W'ith active exercise an increase of about 20 per cent total food units 
may be needed. 



72 LESSONS IN COOKING 

The number of calories or food units needed by the body per 
day depends on the amount of exercise taken, the size of body, and 
to a less extent on age, sex, weather and personal peculiarities. For 
a man of average size and weight taking light exercise, this means 
about 2,800 calories or food units per day; for an average woman 
2,200 calories; for a child of 7 to 9 years, 1,400 calories. (See page 
71 for Table of Food Eequirements.) ' 

To be in correct proportion from 10% to 15% of the total food 
units should be in the form of protein, 85% to 40% in form of fat 
and from 40% to 60%, in the form of starch and sugar.

Part III 



WASHING DISHES 

Study to simplify the process of washing dishes as much 
as possible and to do it so well that it will be enjoyable. 
It is not the dish washing that is disagreeable, but the way 
it is done. All the conveniences that will lessen labor should 
be secured. While preparing a meal keep either a dishpan 
full of hot water standing in the sink, or, better still, stop 
the drain of the sink and fill with hot water. As the dishes 
are used drop into the water and at any convenient moment 
wash, dry and put away. 

To stop up the sink use a flat rubber disk which is held 
tightly over the drain by suction. These cost lo or 15 cents. 
In lieu of this a cloth or dish laid tightly over the drain 
will keep the water in for some time. Some of the more 
modern drains are supplied with a shut-off. 

Requisites for Dishwashing 

1. Dishpan, draining pan, dish towels, dish cloth, dish 
mop, a long-handled fiber brush, pot scraper, soap shaker, 
roll of tissue paper, sink strainer and sink scraper. 

2. Plenty of hot water, soap and a sand, cleaner. 

3. A short piece of hose or rubber tubing attached to 
each faucet is a great convenience. The water can be 
turned in any direction desired and when running it does 
not splash or make much noise. 

General Preliminaries 

As the dishes are removed from the table quickly and 
carefully wipe all those that require it with tissue paper, 
instead of scraping. Instead of paper a crust of bread 
may be used. Pile all dishes of a kind together. Wipe the 
silver with paper and stand up in a tall pitcher with a broad 
base and filled with water. Put to soak everything that 
needs it, using cold water except for dishes which are 
greasy or have had sugar cooked in them. All greasy dishes 
should be thoroughly wiped out with paper. 

73 



74 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Process I — With Running Water 

1. Pile dishes neatly and carefully in the sink, keep- 
ing the glasses and silver at one end. Turn in the cold 
water and rinse thoroughly. 

2. Stop the drain and turn on the hot water, holding 
the soap shaker containing scraps of soap, at the mouth 
of the hose, and directing the water all over . the dishes, 
filling the sink. 

3. Let stand for 15 or 20 m while doing other work. 

4. Remove the stopper, let the soapy water drain off, 
and turn on the clean hot water, rinsing thoroughly. Dry 
glasses and silver. 

5. Pile the dishes in the drainer and wipe those re- 
quiring it, but if the rinsing water is very hot, scarcely any 
drying is necessary. 

Process II — Without Running Water, Dish- Washing 
Device 

1. Use two dishpans, large frying basket, folding dish 
drainer and a long-handled fiber brush or a dish mop. 

2. Fill both dishpans two-thirds full of very hot water, 
making a strong suds in the left-hand one. 

3. Have the dishes piled at the left and the folding dish 
drainer at the right. 

4. Put the wire basket into the soapy water, wash sil- 
ver with the brush and drop into the basket. 

5. When the silver is all in, lift the basket, let drain a 
second and lower into the rinsing water. 

6. Drain an instant from rinsing water and wipe silver. 

7. With plates, etc., wash each plate with the brush as it 
is put into the basket in the soapy water. When all plates 
of a size are in, lift out basket, tip to drain a second and 
lower into the rinsing water; drain and put plates into the 
folding dish drainer, each separate. If rinsing water is 
very hot and sufficient soap is used in the washing v/ater, 
plates will dry perfectly, clean and bright. 

8. When the water in the rinsing pan becomes some- 
what dirty, add soap and use it for the washing pan, fill- 
ing up the other pan anew with clean rinsing water. 

The advantage of this method is that the hands are kept 



NOVEMBER MENUS 75 

out of the water entirely, that very hot v/ater may be used, 
that nothing hut the glasses and silver need be wiped, thus 
saving time and labor. 

It takes less gas to heat water directly in the dishpans 
than in a kettle. 

Note. — ^As the large size frying basket and the folding dish drainer 
are not easily obtained except in large department stores, the School 
has made arrangements to furnish, through its Purchasing Depart- 
ment, this apparatus, consisting of folding dish drainer, large wire 
basket, and two fiber brushes for $1.50, express prepaid east of the 
Eoeky Mountains, $2.00 west. 

Process III — Without Running Water 

1. Pile dishes neatly and carefully on the table at the 
left of the dishpan. Arrange drain pan at the right. 

2. Fill dishpan with hot water and use the soapshaker, 
making a good suds. 

3. Wash glasses and silver first, rinse with hot water 
and dry. 

4. Pour this hot rinse water into the dishpan and pro- 
ceed with the rest of the dishes. 

5. When through, wash the dishpan and the dish cloth 
thoroughly, using plenty of soap and water. Then wash 
the hands in cold water to remove the odor of the dishwater. 

Description of Requisites 

1. For dish towels a good absorbent should be selected. 
The best and cheapest are flour sacks and sugar sacks. 
The sugar sacks are the best, as they are very large. These 
can be obtained from grocers at almost no cost. Wash, then 
rip the stitching and hem. The coarse linen crash makes 
very good towels. They should be about i yard long and 
J/2 yard wide. 

The dish towels should be scalded and rinsed each day 
after breakfast, or at the most convenient time. When- 
ever possible they should be hung in the sunshine. 

2. Dish cloths may be made from the dish towels as 
they get thin, cutting them into small pieces and hemming 
them. (Dish rags should never be seen in a home.) 

Two dish cloths should always be on hand, one for the 
kettles and the pans, the other for the glass and china. 



76 LESSONS IN COOKING 

They should be washed and scalded with the dish towels 
and spread out carefully to dry on the finger rack after 
each meal. 

3. A dish mop is very convenient to use for glasses, 
deep pitchers, etc., and to keep the hands out of very hot 
water. When through using wash with soap, scald, wring 
out and then shake thoroughly, separating the strands. Hang 
with the mop end up, allowing the strands to fall apart 
and so dry. The fiber brush is even better for such pur- 
poses. It should be cleaned each time it is used. 

4. A pot scraper or chain dish cloth should be thorough- 
ly rinsed and dried over the stove. 

5. A soapshaker is most convenient to use up all the 
small bits of soap that are left. Do not use bits of sapolio. 
These may be ground up and kept in a can for scouring 
purposes. 

6. A roll of tissue paper hanging in a convenient place 
on the kitchen wall is most useful. In lieu of this a large 
pocket may be placed on the back of a door or elsewhere 
in which scraps of tissue or soft paper may be kept ready 
for use. 

7. A sink strainer should be of good size, raised about

These are much more satisfactory than those that hang in 
the corner. The holes should be small enough to retain all 
the solid matter.

Start cereal to cooking. Make the muffins. While baking 
make the fish cakes from the mashed potatoes and baked 
fish left from the preceding evening. Or if desired the cakes 
may be made the evening before and set away in a cool 
place until morning. While browning make the coffee. 

Serve the cereal, then the fish cakes, muffins and coffee. 

Saturday Morning Baking 

The following dishes for the Saturday and Sunday meals 
should be prepared in the order given : 

Brown Bread 

See Lesson 17.

STEWED CHICKEN DUMPLINGS 

MASHED POTATOES CREAMED TURNIPS 

CRANBERRY TELLY 

FRUIT PUDDING HARD SAUCE 

Stewed Chicken 

Singe the chicken by passing it quickly several times 
over a direct flame. Remove the pin feathers and tendons, 
and oil sac from the tail, then separate the fowl into pieces 
at the joints. Beginning with the legs, cut through the 
loose skin between the legs and the body, bend the leg and 
cut off at the joint; by moving the legs a little the joint 
between the "second joint" and the drumstick may be ascer- 
tained; cut through the flesh at this point, then sever the 
Hgaments. Cut through the skin and flesh on the under 
side where the wing joins the body, and disjoint the wing. 
Make an incision between the end of the breast-bone and 
the tail, then remove the internal organs. Cut through the 
ribs and the articulation at the top of the collar bone, thus 
separating the breast and back; divide the back by cutting 
through the middle crosswise and breaking at the joint. 
Often the wish-bone and the flesh attached to it are cut off 
and the rest of the breast chopped in two parts at the bone; 
these, however, while convenient for serving, are not natural 
divisions. Be very careful to remqve the lungs and the 
kidneys, which are the dark brown substance lying in the 
hollows under the backbone. Wash thoroughly in soda 
water, rubbing the skin well with a cloth. 

Place the pieces of chicken in a saucepan, cover with i 
quart of boiling water, add an onion with a clove pressed 
into it, a bit of bayleaf, and ^ t salt. Boil. lo m, skim off 
the coagulated juices which rise to the top, lest they settle 
upon the chicken and cause it to look unsightly, then lower 
the flame and let cook below the boiling point until the 
chicken is tender. Add the dumplings, made according to 
directions given in Lesson 33. When done, remove at once 
to a hot platter, add % c flour mixed with J4 c water to 
the broth, and cook until thick, stirring all the time. Place 
chicken in the center of the platter with the dumplings 
formmg a^border. Pour the gravy over all. 



NOVEMBER MENUS 97 

Creamed Turnips 

Wash and pare the turnips and put on to cook, after being 
cut in small pieces, in boiling salted water. Cook about 
20 m, or until tender. Drain, and cover with i c medium 
White Sauce. (See "Helpful Suggestions," Part I.) 

For Mashed Potatoes see Lesson 3, 

For Fruit Pudding see Lesson 58. 

Preparing the Meal 

The chicken may be prepared for cooking on Saturday, 
then placed in a covered dish in a cool place until ready to 
cook on Sunday. If one possesses a "fireless cooker," after 
boiling the chicken for 10 m it may be placed in a "cooker" 
and left for 3 h or more, depending upon the age and tough- 
ness of the fowl. 

If a "fireless cooker" is not available, then put the chicken 
on to cook about 2 h before dinner time, or if very tough 
more time should be allowed. 

About 40 m before serving, wash and pare the potatoes 
and turnips and put on to cook. Twenty minutes or so 
later make the dumplings and drop into the broth. The 
pudding, which has been cooked the day before, may be 
reheated by steaming over the chicken while it is cooking. 
Make the cream sauce for the turnips, mash the potatoes, 
cream the turnips, thicken the broth, and serve the dinner.

Orange and Cherry Salad 

Remove the white membrane from the pulp of 2 oranges 
and cut each section into half, crosswise. Mix i c pine- 
apple, cut into cubes, with J^ c candied cherries, halved, by 
tossing together with two forks. Add the oranges and 
cover the salad with Lemon Cream Sauce.

Beat the whites of 2 eggs until foamy, add i c sugar, 
beat well, then add i c scalded milk and the juice of i lemon. 
Water may be substituted for milk. To make it yellow use 
the whole egg. 

Preparing the Meal 

Prepare and stuff the turkey the day before. If it is a 
large turkey, weighing over 10 pounds, it would be best to 
bake it for an hour the night before, leaving it in the oven 
as it cools oflf. Then start the baking again about 8 o'clock 
in the morning, keeping the temperature very low and 
basting from time to time. While baking it should be laid 
first on one side, then the other, and as soon as browned 
turned on the breast and left there until a few minutes 
before taking from the oven, when it should be turned on 
the back, allowing the breast to brown. 

The turkey should be dressed the day before, full direc- 
tions for which will be found in "Helpful Suggestions," 
page loi. 

The cranberry jelly can be made if desired the day before, 
reheated in the morning, and poured into the orange cups. 
In the morning the orange cups may be prepared by cutting 
well shaped oranges into halves, crosswise. Remove the 



100 LESSONS IN COOKING 

pulp carefully so that it can be used for salad. If desired, 
scallop the edges and fill with the cranberry jelly, putting 
in a cool place to set. 

An hour before dinner time wash and scrub the sweet 
potatoes. Put on to cook in boiling water. The pudding, 
which should have been made beforehand, may be reheated 
in a steamer set over the potatoes. Prepare the fruit for the 
salad and set in a cool place. Then make the Lemon Cream 
Sauce. When the potatoes are tender remove from the 
boiling water and prepare for the oven. Make the soup 
and the cracker crisps. The table should have been pre- 
pared before the dinner was started. The last thing before 
serving the dinner make the sauce for the pudding. 

While serving the soup and cracker crisps, keep the rest 
of the meal hot. Just before serving the dessert, beat the 
sauce thoroughly. 



NOVEMBER MENUS 101 

HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS 

Dressing and Trussing a Fowl 

A good chicken or turkey should be plump, the cartilage 
at the end of the breast-bone soft and pliable, and the legs 
smooth. If very young there will be many pin feathers. 
These and all the feathers should be carefully removed. 
Then scorch well by holding over a direct flame, burning 
paper or otherwise. 

Then proceed as follows : 

1. With a sharp knife cut through the thick skin on the 
leg I inch below the knee. Break the bone at this point. 
Insert a stiff skewer under each one of the tendons found 
on the back and front of leg and pull carefully, removing 
as many as possible. A few may break. Then remove the 
leg, leaving an inch of bone below the joint. When baked 
this will come off easily, leaving a fresh, unburned end. 

2. Split the skin down the back of the neck and cut the 
neck out even with the shoulders, leaving the skin loose. 

3. Remove the crop, windpipe, etc., from the neck. .This 
can be done, especially if the crop is full ; otherwise, remove 
with the rest of the entrails, loosening thoroughly by break- 
ing all the connecting membranes with the finger. Be care- 
ful not to break the skin over the breast. 

4. Remove the oil sac from the tail. 

5. Insert sharp pointed knife and cut vent loose from 
the skin. 

6. Make an incision under the left leg. Insert the fingers 
and break through the membrane. Then work the fingers 
up around between the breast and the intestines, and around 
next to the back, thus loosening everything. Take hold of 
the giz?ard and remove carefully, bringing with it all of the 
entrails. See that the lungs and kidneys, which lie against 
the back, are removed. 

7. Put fowl into a pan of water to which has been added 
I t soda for every 2 quarts of water. With a small cloth 
wash carefully inside and out, rubbing the skin well. Then 
rinse thoroughly, letting plenty of water run through the 
fowl. Dry well. 

8. Lay the fowl on the back, season inside with salt and 
pepper, and stufif the breast until it is smooth and plump. 



102 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Fold the skin of the neck down on the back and pin with a 
small steel skewer. 

9. Stuff the body of the fowl, press the legs close to the 
body, hold firmly with one hand and with the other push 




Chicken Stuffed and Trussed for Roasting. 



the thigh up into the side. Fasten with a skewer run 
through from one leg to the other. Lay wings close to the 
body and fasten with a skewer. Insert a skewer under the 
tail. Wrap a piece of cord around the tail, bringing one end 
up on the right side, wrapping it twice around the leg 
skewer, then up around the wing skewer across under the 
back, repeating the process on the left side, bringing it down 
and fastening at the tail. 

10. Season all well, and rub over with melted butter. 

Sauteing Method of Cooking in Fat 

Sauteing is cooking in a small amount of fat. This 
process is commonly known as frying. Food so cooked is 
very difficult to digest because it is impossible to prevent the 
fat from penetrating and soaking into the food. 
Frying 

Frying is cooking by immersing the food in deep, hot fat. 
The fat should be hot enough to immediately form a crust, 
which, while allowing the penetration of heat, keeps the food 
dry and digestible. 
The Cracking Point 

The cracking point of fat, commonly called the burning 
point, or the point at which it breaks up into glycerine and 
fatty acids, determines its frying qualities. The higher this 
point, the better for frying. The lowest temperature at 
which food can be cooked is 360° F. If Ihe fat "cracks" 
at this point, or below it, it is not only undesirable but also 
injurious to use. Vegetable fats or oils have a much higher 
cracking point than animal fats, hence are much better for 
frying. Olive oil would be the best if the cost need not be 



NOVEMBER MENUS 103 

considered. In such case, Wesson Cooking Oil or other 
cottonseed-oil pioducts, if thoroughly purified, can be used. 
Animal fats which have a low cracking point, such as lard, 
clarified drippings, suet, etc., must be used with great care 
to have them hot enough to cook in and yet not burn. 

Cooking fats do not boil, the bubbles arising in the kettle 
of hot fat, and the spluttering noises, being caused by water 
in the fat. The temperature of "spluttering fat" is about 
212° F. (the boiling point of water), and it will not become 
any hotter so long as any water remains in 'the fat. When 
this is all evaporated the fat becomes still and the tempera- 
ture should rise to about 380° F. 

When the frying is completed and the fat has stood a 
few minutes to cool and settle, strain through a sieve over 
which a piece of cheesecloth has been placed, into a clean 
receptacle. Wipe out the kettle with cloth or paper, return 
the fat, cover closely, and set aside. Fat in the liquid form, 
such as oil, is very convenient, as it can be poured back into 
the cans, ready for use the next time, and kept until needed. 

If after use the fat becomes dark colored heat very slowly 
and drop in a few slices of raw potato. They will quickly 
absorb various impurities from the fat and thus clarify it. 
Test for Frying Temperature 

For uncooked articles, doughnuts, etc., fat should be hot 
enough to brown a bit of bread in 40 seconds. 

For cooked articles, croquettes, etc., fat should be hot 
enough to brown bread in 20 seconds. 
To Prevent Food Absorbing Fat 

Have fat hot enough to answer the above test. 

Do not put too many cold articles in at once. 

Do not have the mixture too rich. 

Do not use too much baking powder. 

Have an unbroken coating of egg and crumbs on cro- 
quettes. 
Care After Frying 

Hold frying-basket over the hot fat until it is well drained. 

Place fried articles on unglazed brown paper. 

Do not pile articles until they are cold. 
To Prepare Bread Crumbs 

Dry pieces of bread thoroughly, either in the open air 
or in "a slow oven. Crush them fine and even with a rolling 



104 LESSONS IN COOKING 

pin, or else run through a food grinder. If two grades are 
desired, sift them, keeping the finer crumbs in one jar and 
the coarser in another. 
How to Egg and Crumb Croquettes 

Break an egg in a plate, beat slightly with a fork, and 
add I T water. Place a fork and tablespoon in this mixture. 

Fill another plate with crumbs. 

Roll the croquette in crumbs to dry it. Place it upon the 
fork and dip the tgg over it with the spoon, carefully 
covering every -part. 

Drain and slip from the fork into the crumbs, and give the 
final shaping. Cover croquette well with crumbs before 
handling it. 

Be careful not to get the fork and spoon into the crumbs. 

A wire egg whip used in place of the fork is convenient 
for large, soft croquettes. 

Cake Baking 
Classes of Cakes 

1. With Butter. Illustration: pound cake, fruit cake, 
etc. 

2. Without Butter. Illustration: sponge cake, angel 
cake, etc. 

Ingredients 

In making cakes use the best ingredients; fresh eggs, 
good butter, fine granulated sugar, and pastry flour. Bread 
flour may be used, but the texture of the cake will not be so 
delicate on account of the greater amount of gluten. In 
using bread flour take one-eighth less per cup than directed 
by the recipe. Oleo and other fats may be used but not such 
fine cake results. 
Flour Test 

To test good pastry flour see that it has a velvety soft 
texture when rubbed between the fingers. Bread flour will 
feel grainy. 
Order of Work 

1. Prepare the pans. 

2. Collect and measure materials. 

3. Heat and regulate oven. 
Preparing the Pans 

If paper is used on the bottom of the pan it must fit neatly 
without folds or creases and project a little above the sides 



NOVEMBEB MENUS 105 

of the pan. Grease the pan, then place the paper in the pan, 
grease the paper and dust lightly with flour. If paper is not 
used grease the pan and dust lightly with flour. 
Test for Oven 

The oven is hot enough if it will brown flour in 5 m, or if 
the hand can be held in the oven while counting 20 slowly. 
Temperature 

On account of the presence o? a large amount of egg 
sponge and angel cakes must be baked at a much lower tem- 
perature than butter cakes. 
Process of Making Butter Cakes 

1. Soften and cream butter. 

2. Add sugar gradually and cream. 

3. Add beaten yolks, if used. 

4. Mix and sift dry ingredients. 

5. Add to the first mixture, alternating with the liquid. 

6. Cut and fold in the whites of the eggs beaten stiff. 

7. Put into the pans and bake. 
Time of Baking 

Layer cakes require from 20 to 25 m. 

Loaf cakes take from 40 to 60 m. or longer. 

Divide the time into quarters. 

First Quarter — Cake should raise on sides. 

Second Quarter — Cake should raise in center and specks 
of brown appear. 

Third Quarter — Cake should brown evenly all over. 

Fourth Quarter — Cake should shrink from the sides of 
the pan and settle. 

To determine if the cake is done press with the finger ; if it 
springs back from the touch it is done. Or push a well 
sterilized broom straw into the cake. If any particles cling 
to it the cake needs longer baking. If done the straw will 
come out clean. 
To Remove From the Pans 

As soon as the cake is done renlove from the pans by 
inverting it over a wire cake cooler, or an old piece of linen 
spread on the bread board. If inclined to stick, loosen care- 
fully with a knife, or rest the pan successively on different 
sides, letting the weight of the cake help to loosen it. If it 
sticks badly on the bottom set the pan for a few minutes on a 
cold wet cloth. Do not frost the cake until cold.

Note. — Costs are omitted because prices now are changing so 
greatly that they would not be correct for more than a week 
or two. 

It will be seen from the foregoing detailed tables and from 
the summary that, while certain of the meals are not per- 
fectly balanced, the day's menu, in all cases, comes within 
the standard set for a well balanced diet. This is all that 
is required, except in cases of illness. 

In the calculations of the Ifovember Menus it will be 
noted that the portions served are in most eases multiples 
or fractions of 100 food units. In the following pages are 
given tables taken from the Bulletin of the School "Food 
Values," calculated according to this method, devised by 
Professor Irving Fisher of Yale University. From these 
tables all the succeeding nfenus of "Lessons in Cooking" may 
be calculated if desired. After weighing out portions of 100 
food imits once, it is very easy to tell approximately how 
many food units are being served, and by brief calculation 
to find if any given diet is well balanced.

LESSONS IN COOKING 

PART IV 



CANDY MAKING 

Candies can be classed according to the different stages 
of sugar cookery into "soft ball," "hard ball," "crack," and 
"hard crack." (A candy thermoipeter may be purchased 
through the School for $1.50.) . 
Soft Ball 

The sugar and water are boiled together until when 
droppedinto cold water it forms a soft ball. Temperature 
238° F. Example, — fondant. 
Hard Ball 

Instead, of a soft ball the portion dropped into cold water 
should form a firm hard ball. Temperature 254° F. Ex- 
ariiple,— caramels. 
Crack Stage 

The portion, instead of forming a ball becomes snappy 
and brittle. Temperature 26o°-27S° F. Example, — taffies. 
Hard Crack 

As soon as dropped into cold water the portion becomes 
very hard and brittle. Temperature 290° F. Example,— 
peanut candy. 
Caramelization 

When the sugar has been cooked beyond the hard crack 
stage it gradually changes color, from light yellow to deep 
brown and finally a deep red. The temperature varies from 
300° to 350° F. When ^ light golden brown it is used for 
flavoring in custards, ice-cream, etc. When it has reached 
the dark red stage it has lost its sweetness and is then used 
to color gravies, soups, etc. 

Soft Ball Candies 
Plain Fondant 

Boil without stirring, 5 c sugar, 2j^ c water and Y^ t 
cream of tartar to the soft ball stage. Make a swab by 
wrapping a fork with a piece of . linen, dip in hot water 
and wipe the crystals from the sides of the pan as soon as 

117 



118 LESSONS IN COOKING 

they form. This will prevent crystallization. Covering the 
pan the first lo m of cooking also tends to prevent forma- 
tion of crystals. 

Remove from the fire, let stand until cool, then beat until 
creamy. -Turn out onto a marble slab or large platter and 
knead until free from all lumps and "Soft and velvety in 
texture. It is better after standing' 24 h in a covered jar. 

Note: On a damp day the fondant should be cooked to 
240° F. instead of 238° F. The former temperature is more 
satisfactory also when the fondant is to be used at once. 

Chocolate Fondant 

Add 3 ounces grated chocolate to the above recipe for 
Plain Fondant and proceed as above. 

Coffee Fondant 

Make i>^ c strong coffee, strain and add 5 c ^ugar and 
1/2 t cream of tartar, and proceed as for Plain Fondant.

sugar, I c hot water and ^ t cream of tartar. Proceed as 
for Plain Fondant. 
Cream Mints 

IMelt I lb Plain Fondant over hot water. Flavor with 3 
drops either oil of peppermint, wintergreen, clove, cinna- 
mon, or orange. Color if desired. Drop from the tip of 
a teaspoon onto oiled paper. i 

Fruit and Nut Loaf 

Into 2 c Plain or Maple Fondant work }i c each chopped 
pecans, candied pineapple, and cherries. Different com- 
binations of fruit and nuts may be used. Roll in oiled paper 
and mould in a tin box. If no box is available, shape as 
desired, and roll in oiled paper. 
Neapolitan Creams 

Put together Coffee, Maple and Plain Fondant, the lat- 
ter colored if desired, in alternate layers. Chopped fruit; 
nuts and cocoanut may be mixed with the different layers. 
Cut in slices. 
Chocolate Creams 

Mould Fondant into any shape desired. Let stand in a 
cool place until firm. 



DECEMBER MENUS 119 

Melt plain or confectioner's chocolate over hot water.

into different shapes, placing halves of nuts or pieces of 
cherries, pineapple, dates, figs, etc.. on top or inside. 

Remove the seeds from dates and fill the cavity thus made 
vi'ith a small roll of Fondant. Figs also can be used in the 
same way, filling the fig and slicing across. 
Chocolate Fudge 

Boil together 2 c sugar, 2 ounces chocolate, and 2/3 c 
milk to the soft ball stage (238° F.) ; remove from the fire 
and add i T butter. When cool add i t vanilla and stir

Hard Ball Candies 
Caramels 

Boil together 4 c sugar, 3 T glucose and i c water to the 
hard ball stage (254° F.). Add i c of cream and boil until 
it again reaches the hard ball stage. The cream thins the 
mixture so that this additional boiling is necessary. Just 
before removing from the fire add 2 t vanilla, pour into a 
greased pan and when cool cut into squares. If desired, 

2 c of nut meats may be added just before pouring out. 
For Chocolate Caramels add 4 ounces chocolate and pro- 
ceed as above.

dates and English walnuts. Knead well with confectioner's 
sugar until it is not sticky. Roll out to J^ inch thickness, 
cut in squares, rounds or diamonds, dip in confectioner's 
sugar and lay in layers between oiled paper or in tin boxes. 
These will keep for weeks. A little lemon juice worked in 
while kneading improves the flavor. 

Stuffed Dates 

Cut dates lengthwise, remove the seeds and fill with nuts. 
Roll in granulated sugar. 



DECEMBER MENUS 121

3 h. Bring to the table without removing the cover. 



130 LESSONS IN COOKING 

This may be cooked very nicely in a fireless cooker al- 
lowing, however, about 5 h for its cookery there. 

Scalloped Potatoes 

Wash and pare 4 medium sized potatoes. Into a but- 
tered baking dish slice very thinly enough potatoes to cover 
the bottom of the dish. Over this sprinkle salt, pepper, and 
dots of butter. Also about j^ T flour. Now add another 
layer of thinly sliced potatoes and proceed as before. When 
the potatoes are all used sprinkle buttered breadcrumbs 
over the top and add milk until it comes to the top layer 
of the potatoes. Bake until the potatoes are tender add- 
ing more milk if necessary. The potatoes will require about 
I h to bake. 

Plain Pastry 

Sift lyi c flour, ^ t salt, and j4 t baking powder into 
a chopping bowl. Flour the blade of a chopping knife, and 
chop }i c oi shortening (lard, butter, suet, snowdrift, cot- 
tolene, or a combination of any two or all) into the flour, 
being very careful to keep the flour between the blade of 
the knife and the shortening as much as possible. When 
the mixture looks like meal, each little particle of fat being 
coated with flour, add, gradually, cold wate^^ enough to 
make a stiff paste that is not crumbly, but sticks together 
without adhering to the bowl or knife. A case knife is 
preferable for mixing paste. When the paste, rolled with 
the knife into a ball, has taken up all the particles of dough 
or flour on the sides of the bowl, turn onto a board, lightly 
dredged with- flour, roll about in the flour with the knife, 
then pat with the rolling pin into a rectangular shape and 
roll out to the thickness required. Dust the board with 
flour when necessary, but use as little as possible. 

Lemon Filling 

Beat the yolks of 3 eggs until light and thick; add 
gradually i c fine granulated sugar, and one at a time the 
unbeaten whites of 2 eggs. 

Beat j4 c butter to a cream, and add the egg mixture 
to this gradually, also the juice of 2 lemons, and the grated 
rind of i. Cook over hot water stirring constantly until 
the mixture thickens, then set aside to cool while the crust

Tripe — Fried in Batter 

Make a batter by beating 2 eggs until light, adding to 
them J/2 c milk i T melted butter, and i c flour sifted with 
j4 t salt and 2 t sugar. Beat the whole mixture together 
until smooth and light. 

Tripe as it comes from the market is usually cooked and 
sometimes pickled. More cooking is generally needed to 
make it perfectly tender and if pickled, to remove some of 
the vinegar. Cut the tripe in pieces suitable for serving and 
boil, either in milk or water, or equal parts of each, until 
tender. This will require about )4 h. RemoVe from the 
water, dry, dip into the batter, draining off as much as pos- 
sible, and fry in deep fat. 

Cornbread 

Sift together ^ c cornmeal, % c flour, ^ t salt, J/2 t 
soda, and i T sugar. Mix with i beaten egg, and i c thick 
sour milk. Bake in a moderate oven 30 m. 

Apple Sauce

CABBAGE MOULD WITH MEAT BALLS AND TOMATO SAUCE 
GRAHAM BREAD TEA 

Cabbage Mould 

Cut and reserve the interior leaves from a rather large 
head of cabbage, and gently steam, until tender, the larg< 
outside leaves, being very careful to preserve the shape. 

Pass any meat left from the beef cannelon the preceding 
evening through a meat grinder, and mix with enough 
Thick White Sauce (p. 38) to form balls of it. If no meat 
is left raw meat may be ground, made into balls and broiled. 

Make a Tomato Sauce according to directions, p. 125. 

Either put the meat balls in the steamer with the cab- 
bage to heat, or else drop them into a saucepan of boiling 
water until thoroughly hot. Of course this latter is un- 
necessary if the meat has to be cooked. 

When the cabbage is tender, remove from the steamer, 
fill the center with the hot meat balls, and pour the Tomato 
Sauce over all. Serve at once. 

Graham Bread 

Sift 3 c graham flour, 1% t soda, and 2 t baking-powder 
thoroughly. Add yi c brown sugar, }i c molasses, and 2j4

BOILED SALMON EGG SAUCE 

MASHED POTATOES CARROTS IN TURNIP CUPS 

PRUNE BLANC MANGE 

Boiled Salmon 

In cooking fish in boiling liquid two things must be kept 
in mind, appearance and nutritive value. Cold liquid draws 
out the juices, while plunging the fish in boiling liquid 
causes the skin to contract and crack. Consequently a 
medium course must be pursued. 

Select a piece from the middle cut of salmon, say 2 or 
3 pounds. Lower the fish fastened on a fish rack, or in the 
absence of this utensil, in a frying basket, or wrapped in a 
piece of cheese cloth, into hot water; bring quickly to the 
boiling point; then let simmer until the flesh separates 
readily from the bones, and no longer. After the simmer- 
ing begins the cooking will take from 5 to 8 m per pound, 
according to the thickness of the fish. Let the liquid just 
cover the fish; add lyi t salt and i T vinegar or lemon 
juice for each 2 quarts of water. The vinegar or lemon 
juice makes the flesh firm and also whitens it. When the 
fish is done, drain and serve with some sauce, in this case 
Egg Sauce. 
Egg Sauce 

Melt 3 T butter ; add 2 T flour, % t salt, and }i t pepper. 
Mix well together then add slowly, stirring all the time, i 
c hot water. Boil several minutes until the flour is thor- 
oughly cooked, then add little by little, 2 T butter. When 
this is all well beaten into the mixture add 2 hard cooked 
eggs chopped fine. Pour over the fish and serve very hot. 
Carrots in Turnip Cups 

Pare small, well shaped, white turnips. Cut slices from 
the stem end and with a potato scoop remove the flesh leav- 
ing a cup. Throw these into boiling salted water and sim- 
mer for 2D m. Lift each one carefully with the skimmer, 
and turn upside down to drain. While these are cooking, 
cut young carrots into dice, throw them into a kettle of boil- 
ing water, and cook gently 20 m ; drain in a colander. Ar- 
range the turnip cups while hot on a heated chop plate ; add 
to the carrots >^ t salt, a dash pepper, and J4 c cream, or 



DECEMBER MENUS 137 

}i c milk thickened with }i T flour. Shake aver the fire 
until hot, then fill the turnip cups; garnish the dish with 
parsley and serve. 
Prune Blanc Mange 

J\Iake plain blanc mange (p. 29), 4 T cornstarch, 2 T 
sugar, y2 c cold milk, mix, add ij4 c hot milk, J^ t salt, 
bring to the boil, then finish in the double boiler. About 5 
m before it is done add i c cooked prunes, seeded and cut 
into small pieces, and just before moulding, i t vanilla. 
Mashed Potatoes 

For 8 potatoes use 3 T butter, i/^ t salt and }^ c milk or 
cream. See Lesson 3, page 15. 
Preparing the Meal 

About % h before dinner time wash and pare the pota- 
toes and put them on to cook. Algo cook the turnips and 
carrots, then the fish. 

While these things are cooking make the Egg Sauce, and 
if cream is not available for the carrots, thicken the milk. 

Arrange the Prune Blanc Mange which should have been 
made in the morning, in dessert dishes ready for serving. 

Drain and mash the potatoes, drain the turnip cups and 
carrots, pour the dressing on the carrots, add to the turnip 
cups and arrange on a hot chop plate. Remove the fish 
from the water, drain and put on a hot platter, pour over 
it the Egg Sauce, garnish with parsley, and serve.

Saturday's Baking 
Lemon Butter 

To the juice and grated rind of 3 lemons, add 3 eggs 
well beaten, 2 c sugar, ^4 c water, and i t butter. Beat all 
well together and boil 5 m, or until thick. Care must be 
taken that it does not scorch. 

This will keep indefinitely, and makes a nice variation 
from the regular jellies. 

Sweetbreads 

What is known as the "sweetbread" is the thymus gland, 
found in the neck of the calf or lamb. Frequently, how- 
ever, the pancreas of the veal or beef is sold for sweet- 
breads ; this is inferior in quality and is not the true sweet- 
breads. They should be called "beef sweetbreads." 

As soon as the sweetbreads come from the market wash 
them well, removing all blood and as much membrane as 
possible without tearing the sweetbreads apart. Now soak 
for an hour or more in cold water, changing the water as 
it becomes bloody. 

Cover with boiling water to which salt and lemon juice 
or vinegar have been added in the proportion of i t salt 
and 2 T lemon jmce or vinegar to every quart of vrater. 
The acid is added to whiten the sweetbreads. Lower the 
flame and cook below the boiling point until tender, ^ h or 
more. Drain, cover with cold water to harden, and when 
cool remove all the tubes, outside skin, membranes, etc., 
and separate the sweetbreads into small pieces following 
the lines of natural divisions. 

Devil's Food Cake 

Cream ^ c butter with i c sugar ; separate the yolks and 
whites of 4 eggs, putting the yolks in a mixing bowl and 



DECEMBER MENUS 139 

the whites in a shallow dish where they can be beaten with

until light and creamy, then combine with the butter and 
sugar mixture. Add i c milk alternately with 2y3 c flour 
sifted ^yith j4 t cinnamon, and 4 t baking-powder ; then add 
I t vanilla, J4 c chocolate, melted over hot water, and lastly 
the whites of the eggs beaten dry. Bake in a loaf or in 
layers as desired. If baked in a loaf, it will require about 
1 h in moderate oven. Cover with Boiled Frosting (p. 38). 

Salad Dressing 

Mix J4 T salt, I t mustard, ij4 T sugar, few grains 
cayenne, and yi T flour together well ; add the yolks of two 
eggs slightly beaten, 1J/2 T melted butter, ^4 c milk, and 
very slowly, % c vinegar. Cook over boiling water until 
the mixture thickens ; strain and cool. 

Lemon Sponge 

Soak I T gelatine in J^ c cold water, dissolve in i c 
boiling water, add i c sugar and J4 c lemon juice. Strain 
and as it cools beat occasionally with wire whip or Dover 
egg beater; when quite thick beat well and add the whites 
of 3 eggs beaten stiff; turn into a mould. Serve with Soft 
Custard. 

Soft Custard 

In a double-boiler scald i pint of milk with ^ c sugar 
and ^2 t salt. Add the yolks of 3 eggs beaten slightly, 
heated gradually by pouring some of the hot milk on them 
and stirring them as they are returned to the rest of the 
milk in the double-boiler. Stir constantly and cook until it 
coats the spoon ; turn into a cold bowl, add i t vanilla and 
cool. 

Method of Work 

Immediately after breakfast make the Lemon Butter, then 
make the boiled Salad Dressing, cooking the sweetbreads 
at the same time in the lower part of the double-boiler. 
Next make the Devil'E Food Cake and while it is baking 
soak the gelatine, then make the Soft Custard. Finish the

SUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING THE COST OF 
DECEMBER MENUS 

Substitute oleomargarine for butter in cooking. TTse top of milk 
in place of cream for cereal and coffee. In cooking with milk reduce 
by adding half water, or buy skimmed milk at $ a quart. 

In L. 65 serve toast instead of muffins. Also use % pound bacon 
instead of 1 pound sausage. Get a 5 pound soup bone Monday. For 
lunch, L. 66, have a vegetable soup with stock instead of cream of 
celery soup. For dinner, L. 67, instead of boiled ham, chop the 
soup meat, add to it % o currants, % t cinnamon, clove and all- 
spice mixed, 1 c bread crumbs, 1 egg, and % c stock for each 2 c 
meat. Form into a loaf and bake 20 min in a moderate oven, or ' 
until well heated throughout and browned on top. In pumpkin 
timbales use one whole egg instead of the two eggs. Omit the cream 
with the jellied figs. In L. 68 omit the peaches with the cereal. In 
L. 69 serve the omelet plain and omit the raspberry jam. In L. 70 
use 1 whole egg instead of 2 yolks in the sweet rice croquettes. 
Omit the oranges in L. 71; also the egg in the creamed codfish. Use 
• plain bread and butter in place of the rye muffins. In L. 72 omit 
the mushrooms from the macaroni dish; also use but half of the 
hermit recipe. 

In L. 73, if the rabbit must be purchased, substitute 1 pound 
round steak for brown stew (p. 51). Also serve bread pudding 
(see recipe, p. 49) instead of lemon pie. In L. 76 make a shortcake 
as on p. 47. In L. 77 use but 1 egg in the batter for tripe, adding 
% c water. In L. 79 omit the egg sauce for the salmon, of which 
1 pound instead of 2 will be sufficient. In L. 80 serve buttered toast 
instead of Scotch scones. In L. 82 omit the banana salad and 
wafers. In L. 84 substitute 1% lbs ham for 4 lbs roast beef. Also 
omit the Yorkshire pudding and serve mashed, instead of franconia

LESSONS IN COOKING 

PART V 



FUELS AND STOVES 

Vhatever the kind of stove used one rule will apply to 
—know your stove. Understand the principle of its 
struction ; if there are dampers, find out the use of each ; 
dy the drafts ; know the properties of the fuel used so as 
economize and yet secure the best results. 
n appearance the stove should be plain and neat. Orna- 
nts and nickled trimmings mean loss of time and 
mgth spent in polishing, and add to the cost of the 
ve without adding to its merit. 
il 

iard or anthracite coal kindles with difficulty, but when 
ited, burns with intense heat and little flame. It is 
m to handle, contains almost no gas, and makes a steady 
tinuous fire, requiring very little attention. While its 
t is high in places distant from Pennsylvania, many 
sider these qualities make it the best fuel for winter use. 
ioft or bituminous coal kindles easily, and burns with 
siderable flame when first lighted, giving off gas and 
:h soot. In a short time it is reduced to bright red 
Is. This stage in its combustion is best for cooking 
the heat is more steady. Its cost is one-half to one- 
;d that of hard coal. It heats more quickly, but does 
last so long. Only the free-burning varieties of soft 
Is are at all suitable for cooking. The coking coals con- 
i a very large percentage of gas, which gives much 
t, and in burning forms a crust over the fire which 
vents good combustion. 

)od 

Vood is a clean fuel, lights readily and heats quickly, 
bums out so rapidly that it requires a good deal of 
:ntion to keep an even fire. 

Iard wood like oak lasts well and makes a fairly steady 
. Soft wood like pine is used as a fuel only in localities 
;re it is very plentiful, because it burns out so quickly. 
Hiring much attention. It is best for kindling fires.

Coke 

Coke is superior to soft coal for cooking in that it is a 
much cleaner fuel and gives off no soot or gas. Coke, 
which is made in special coke ovens for use in blast fur- 
naces and for domestic use, can now be obtained in all 
the larger cities. The coke which is obtained as a bi- 
product in the manufacture of illuminating gas is much 
softer and dirtier. 

Coke is very'bulky for its weight, it kindles easily, making 
a very intense heat but does not last nearly so long as hard 
coal. It is very helpful in starting the fire when hard coal 
is used, and for increasing the heat quickly. Its price is 
somewhat less than hard coal, but more than soft coal. 

Gas 

Gas is the quickest, cleanest and most convenient fuel to 
use. Its cost is sometimes greater than that of other fuels, 
but the fact that it can be lighted' just at the moment of 
use and instantly turned out when not needed, eliminates 
all waste, thus economizing both time and money. 

The best gas stoves and ranges are now made with the 
broiling and baking ovens above the level of the top of 
the stove, doing away with the stooping and inconvenience 
caused by the old style. 

In selecting these stoves see that the top grates are 
movable and that the stove can be readily cleaned. As the 
stoves become old the valve handles turn easily and are 
sometimes turned on without the knowledge of the worker, 
allowing the gas to escape, which may lead to an ex- 
plosion. There is usually a nut for tightening the valves, 
which should be turned until they are no longer loose. 

In lighting gas stoves let the gas flow for a second before 
applying the match; otherwise the gas may burn back 
producing a yellow flame which soils utensils, and gives 
off poisonous and odorous by-products. If this occurs turn 
out immediately and relight. Closing of the air slots of 
the burner from any cause will give a yellow, smoky flame. 

Before lighting the oven be sure to open the oven door 
until the burners are well lighted. This is to guard against 
the explosion of gas which might have leaked into the oven. 



JANVAUr MENUS 151 

Qw to Use Gas 

1. Have the article ready and oti the burner before the 
s is lighted. 

2. Never turn the gas so high that the red flame shows 
that means imperfect combustion. 

3. As soon as the liquid begins to boil turn the gas 
iwn until there is just enough heat to keep it boiling. 

4. Use the simmering jet whenever possible. It sup- 
ies sufficient heat to keep a large kettle of water boiling. 

5. In most baking, turn out one oven burner or lower 
th after the first fifteen minutes. 

6. A small oven set on top of the stove over one burner, 
r baking small quantities, will reduce the gas bill. In a 
st of baking a pan of muffins, 4 cubic feet of gas were 
insumed with a small portable oven against 12 cubic feet 

the large oven. 

ates of Consumption of Gas 

The following figures are the results given by careful 
sts made by Miss Bertha M. Terrill : 
Top Burners. 
Single burner, full, consumes 1 ft. in 4 to 5 m., or 12 to 15 ft. per 

hour. 
Single burner, just boiling, consumes 1 ft. in 15 to 19 m., or 3 to 

4 ft. per hour. 
Single burner, simmering height, consumes 1 ft. in 29 m., or 

about 2 ft. per hour. 
Double burner, full, consumes 1 ft. in 2 m., or 30 ft. per hour. 

Oven Burners. 
Two burners, full, consume 1 ft. in 1 m., or 60 ft. per hour. 
One burner, full, consumes 1 ft. in 2 m., or 30 ft. per hour. 
One burner, half on, consumes 1 ft. in 3 m., or 20 ft. per hour. 

lectricity 

Electricity is the ideal source of heat for cooking, but 
most places is too expensive for the average home use. 
is absolutely without dirt, can be controlled perfectly, 
id can be used in any part of the house where the con- 
!ction with the electric wires may be made. 
Recently electric stoves have been greatly improved and 
ssened in price, and there are now on the market "electric 
•eless cookers," which use little current. With electricity 
4 cents a Kw. they are said to cook a meal at less expense 
an with gas at $1.00 per 1,000 cu. ft. 



152 LESSONS IN COOKING 

At the present time electric toasters, heating' plat( 
chafing dishes, and coffee percolators are largely used 
dining rooms where attachments can be made with tl 
electric current. These are very convenient and if us( 
carefully are not expensive. 

Gasoline 

Accidents arising from the misuse of gasoline ha' 
created a prejudice against it as a fuel, but if used wi: 
care and judgment, it can well replace coal and wood 
the warm, if not in the cold weather. When open to tl 
air gasoline is~ constantly giving off a highly inflammab 
and explosive gas so that it should never be used in a roo: 
where there is 3 fire or an open flame. 

Coal Oil 

Kerosene of coal oil is much in use as a hot weath( 
substitute for coal and wood. The objections to its u; 
are the odor, soot and grease. If the stoves are kej 
thoroughly clean these objections are minimized. A clot 
wet with gasoline will take off the grease more quick] 
and effectually than anything else. 

Alcohol 

Since "denatured alcohol" has been manufactured an 
the tax on fuel alcohol removed in 1907, the price has bee 
reduced somewiiat, but it still costs from 50 cents to 6 
cents or more a gallon. As it has only two-thirds th 
heating power of kerosene or gasoline, it is an ecoiiomic; 
fuel only for cooking in small quantities. It is safer t 
use than gasoline, but not so safe as kerosene. 

Coal and Wood Stoves 

The same- general principle is observed in the construe 
tibn of these different stoves, namely a good firebox, draft! 
an oven damper, and a chimney damper. A good ste< 
range represents the highest development in cook stoves. 

The fire box and grate are suited to the fuels used, th 
grate being coarse for wood and fine for coal. A rockin; 
grate is better than the older form which shakes by 
backward and forward motion. The front drafts regulat 
the amount of air admitted; the chimney damper whe: 
open, creates a strong draft, drawing the air through th 



JANUARY MENUS 153 

lel and thus increasing combustion. The oven damper, 
hen closed, throws the heat into the oven, when open, 
:rmits it to be drawn up the chimney. 
In lighting a fire open front drafts and chimney dampers, 
itil the fuel is burning briskly, then close all to conserve 
e heat. Keep the oven damper closed except when it is 
isirable to cool off the oven or to increase the draft to 
ake the fire burn better. Watch the fire, replenishing 
e fuel before it burns too low, thus economizing on fuel. 
1 using soft coal a little air should be admitted over the 
■e when coal is first put on to burn the gases driven off. 
In selecting a wood or coal stove see that the dampers 
ork easily and perfectly ; that the ash box is large enough 
id can be readily cleaned ; that the side door when opened 
ill not scatter ashes on the floor; that the oven is a 
3od shape and size and suited to the needs of the family; 
lat the stove can be readily and easily cleaned inside, 
hich should be done at least every six months or oftener 
soft coal is used. 

Keep the ash pit free from ashes for if they accumulate 
lo much the grate becomes overheated and will warp or 
irn out. 

he Labor Saving Cook Stove 

When coal is used as a fuel it should if possible be 
ored in a bin on the same floor as the stove. A good plan 

to have the bottom of the bin raised about a foot and a 
ilf from the floor, with a door in the bin connected 
ith a shute, so that all that is necessary in getting the 
)al is to pull up the door and let the coal run into the 
3d. 

A number of stoves are now on the market having the 
ih pit connected with a 3 or 4 inch sheet iron pipe which 
isses through the kitchen floor into a covered ash can in 
le basement. This saves the disagreeable and dirty task 
: emptying ashes. 

These two devices could be put in with little expense or 
ouble and would save much time and labor over the 
iual method of shoveling coal into a hod in the cellar, 
irrying it upstairs, then shoveling out the ashes and 
.TTyuig them downstairs, and cleaning up afterwards.

Gasoline Stoves 

By far the largest number of gasoline accidents result 
from filling the tank when the stove is lighted. Never 
do this under any circumstances. If using an upright 
tank, close the burners, that is turn out the fire, then 
turn down the tank and fill, being careful not to fill it to 
the top. Close tightly and wipe off every drop of fluid 
which may have fallen on the outer surfaces of the tank. 

The detachable tank should be taken from the stove to 
a lower place where it may be filled, covered tightly, wiped 
off and replaced. Before taking off the tank, be sure that 
the burners are closed. 

If at any time gasoline is spilled upon the floor, stove, 
hands, or garments, do not strike a match until it has 
been wiped up. 

Be sure the gas generator is well heated according to 
directions before the gasoline is turned on. 

Do not place these stoves in a draft; the flame may be 
blown out and the gasoline run down upon the stove 
shelf and the floor. If you find that the stove has gone 
out after being lighted, close the burners and examine 
carefully to see if gasoline has escaped. If so, do not 
relight until the gasoline has been thoroughly dried up and 
evaporated. 

Kerosene Stoves 

Some of the blue flame oil stoves have no wick, while 
others have. The gas is generated from the oil and is 
mixed with air before burning. It burns without soot or 
smoke and when such stoves are given reasonable care 
they are entirely satisfactory. The three hole wick blue 
flame stoves cost about $7.00. 

The two or three burner lamp stoves with small oven 
to fit may be used with satisfaction if given the proper 
care and cleaning. Have the oil tank full of oil; do not 
bum many hours in succession, but give time to cool off; 
keep the wick clean and even; set the stove in a place free 
from drafts as it is liable to smoke otherwise. A three 
burner lamp stove with a small oven may be purchased 
for about $5.00.

READING METERS 
s Meters 

\ ^as meter has three dials each numbered from one to 
. The first dial is called the "i thousand" and measures 
hundred cubic feet up to i,ooo cubic feet. The figures 
it run from 'right to left. The second dial called "lo 
tusand" measures in thousands up to ten thousand cubic 
±, and the figures run from left to right. The third 
led "icxj thousand" measures in ten thousands up to one 
ndred thousand cubic feet and the figures run from 
ht to left. 

To read, the meter begin with the dial on the right and 
:e the figure the hand last passed over, remembering that 
is so many hundred cubit feet. For example, if 2 is the 
t figure the hand has passed over, it reads 200 cubic feet, 
the second dial the hand is moving from left to right 
i the figure last passed over is next taken. On the third 
il the hand is moving from right to left and the figure 
t passed over is taken. The small dial at the top reg- 
ers two cubic feet and is for showing leaks.

LESSONS IN COOKING 



At $r.oo per 1,000 cubic feet the gas bill for June is 
reckoned by dividing 2,100 by 1,000, this to ascertain the 
number of "thousands" used. The result is 2.1. If 1,000 
cubic feet cost $1.00, 2.1 thousands will cost 2.1 times 
$1.00 or 2.10, that is $2.10 the amount of the gas bill. 

Electric Meter 

The electric , meter like the gas meter is composed of 
dials, but the unit of measure is the "watt" or "watt-hour." 
One thousand watts is a kilo-watt. Bills are usually 
measured in kilowatts. 

The method of reading is exactly the same as the gas 
meter — taking always the lower figure next to each hand, 
being careful to note that the hands on the alternate dials 
move in opposite directions.

In reading Meter A, dial I reads 3 kilowatts 

In reading Mteter A, dial II reads 80 kilowatts

July 1st, the total reading is 1,598 kilowatts 

June 1st, the total reading is .1,583 kilowatts 

Electricity used in June 15 kilowatts 

At an average cost of lo cents per kilowatt hpur the 
bill for electricity for June will be $1.50. 



JANVASY MENUS 157 

Tie Constant 

Some meters have upon them the word "constant"' 
Dllowed by a figure. In such case the reading of the 
leter must be multipHed by this figure in order to get the 
orrect total. For example if the constant is yi then the 
eading must be multiplied by yi. Hence in the above read- 
ig if there had been a constant of J4 the total reading 
rould be 15 times J4 or 7J^ kilowatt hours. 

Relative Cost of Fuels 

A number of experiments have been made to find the 
elative cost of fviels in cooking, but they would not be 
pplicable to all home conditions, as many times the heat 
rom the fuel is required for other purposes. But the actual 
ost of cooking the same dinner, including soupstock, with 
oal, gas and kerosene, was found from experiments made 
t the University of Chicago, to be as follows: — coal, 
.0605, gas $.0334, and kerosene $.0353^ The price of coal 
?as $7.75 a ton, gas 85 cents per 1,000 feet, kerosene 12 
;nts a gallon. Compared as to quantities, one ton of hard 
Dal was equivalent to 5,000 cubic feet of gas, and 1,000 
;et of gas to 8 gallons of kerosene. 

Gasoline has nearly the same fuel value as kerosene. A 
Drd of dry hard wood has about the fuel value of half a ton 
f coal. 

Acetylene gas is sometimes used for cooking ; it has about 
ve times the fuel value of ordinary illuminating gas, and 
osts about $1.25 per 100 cubic feet. 

THE FIRELESS COOKER 

Non-conduction of heat is the principle employed in the 
Sreless cooker." This is obtained by a box having a pack- 
ig of some non-conducting material three or four inches 
lick all around, and utensils with very tight covers. It can 
e of simple home construction, such as a box lined with fine 
ay, feathers, ground cork, saw dust, excelsior or crumpled 
aper; or one of the many patented cookers now on the 
larket. Some of these cookers provide only for the reten- 
on of the heat already in the article when put into the 
ox. In such cases the cooking must be done in a consider-

able volume of water. But the later models are provide( 
with soapstone or iron radiators which are heated over th( 
stove and then transferred to the cooker. In this wa] 
dry cooking, baking and roasting can be done successfully 

A combination gas stove and fireless cooker is one o: 
the latest conveniences. The oven is arranged as a fireless 
cooker, the article is set in, the gas lighted, and when i 
certain temperature is reached the gas is turned off anc 
the oven closing tightly becomes a fireless cooker. 

Another contrivance is the electric fireless cooker ir 
which the current is shut off automatically. 

The advantages of a fireless cooker are economy, con- 
venience, and in many cases better cooked food. Theii 
disadvantage is that the meal must be started two or three 
hours or more before it is served, which is not always 
convenient. 

The economy is greatest when high priced electricity or 
gas are the fuels used for cooking. A twenty minute 
burning of gas provides for an extended cooking of from 
two to ten hours. The saving varies from three-fourths to 
two-thirds. 

The convenience of the cooker is greatly appreciated by 
the busy housewife or one who is compelled to be away 
from the home. An entire dinner can be put into the 
cooker in the morning, given no attention whatever during 
the day, and with lo m work is ready to serve. 

The quality of the food is often improved by the long 
cooking at the lower temperature. This is especially true 
of meats, dried fruits, vegetables and cereals. 

Caution — After meats have been in the cooker long 
enough to allow the temperature to drop to that of blood 
heat they must be removed im.mediately and either cooled 
quickly or else reheated. Otherwise decomposition sets in 
very rapidly at this temperature, and if the meat be eaten 
later may cause serious trouble.

being considered the finest grained, but as it is fatter, it is 
sometimes not so desirable. Rinse the meat in cold water, 
fasten in shape, and put on to cook in cold water. Remove 
the scum after it has boiled 5 or 10 m, then let simmer 
slowly until tender. This may take 5 or 6 h.

ding and set to steam over the meat. One h before serv- 
ing prepare the vegetables, remove the meat and put the 
vegetables on to cook, being careful in moving the steamer 
not to jar it, and thus cause the pudding to fall. Also have

of cold water, an onion with a clove pressed into it, a bit 
of bay leaf, and i t salt. Bring the water quickly to the 
boiling point, boil lo m, skim off the coagulated juices 
which rise to the top, then lower the flame and simmer 
until the chicken is tender. Drain from the broth. 

Melt j4 c butter, add j/^ c flour, salt and pepper to taste, 
and when blended add the chicken broth gradually, strain- 
ing out the vegetables ; simmer 15 m. Beat the yolks of 4 
eggs, add a little of the hot broth gradually, then stir into 
the hot mixture. Add the pieces of chicken and reheat 
over hot water. Serve garnished with toast points. 

Bavarian Cream 

Whip 2 c single cream and drain the whip. Scald ^ c 
cream that is drained from the whip, adding milk if neces- 
sary to make the full amount, with yi c sugar; add the 
yolk of 2 eggs, beaten and mixed with j4 c sugar, J^ t 
salt, and cook as a soft custard. When the liquid will coat 
the spoon, remove from the fire and add J4 package gela- 
tine, soaked in j4- c cold water; strain. Set in a pan of ice 
water and stir until the mixture begins to thicken,, then 
fold in the whip from the cream and i t vanilla. Pour 
into a mould and set in a cold place; or, better, pack in 
salt and ice until firm. 
Mock Bavarian Cream 

In this case no cream need be used, but the whites of 6 
eggs, 4 left from the chicken and 2 more, beaten stiff, may 
be substituted. Make the custard with the yolks of 2 eggs, 
%c of milk, etc., as above. 

Mashed Potatoes 

Use 4 potatoes, ij^ T butter, ^4 c hot milk or cream, ^ 
t salt (p. 15). 

Spinach

Add I c each cracker and breadcrumbs to yk c melted 
butter and mix well; sprinkle the bottom of a buttered 
baking dish with crumbs, then place on these a layer of 
cleaned oysters, and dust with salt and pepper. Add alter- 
nately layers of crumbs and oysters, having the top layer 
crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven 15 or 20 m. A shal- 
low dish should be selected for oysters, so that they may 
be quickly heated and cooked, as long cooking at high 
temperature toughens the oysters and destroys their delicate 
flavor. 

Preparing the Meal 

About yi h before suppertime wash the oysters and 
prepare them for scalloping. While baking cut the brown 
bread, open a can of cherries and empty into a fruit dish ; 
put some oatmeal macaroons on a plate and place all on 
the table. Make the tea and serve the supper.

Oysters a la Creole 

Drain i quart of oysters, wash and remove all bits of 
shell from each one. If very large cut in half. 

Scald I pint of milk or cream. Thicken with % c butter 
and y2 c flour, made into a roux. Season with salt, pepper, 
yi t onion juice, i T lemon juice, i T chopped parsley and 
2 T chopped pimentoes. Cook until thick and creamy, then 
add the oysters. When plump serve in Timbale Cases. 
Tim,bale Cases 

Beat 2 eggs slightly, add i c milk. Sift i c flour and 
34 t salt together. Add enough of the egg and milk to 
make a batter that can be beaten smooth and velvety, then 
add the rest of the liquid. Fry with a timbale iron in 
deep fat. 

Timbale Frying 

The best iron for frying is the hollow one which fills 
with the hot mixture and cooks from the inside as well 
as the out. When frying turn the timbale batter into a 
cup, lower the hot iron into the cup so that the batter 
comes within Yz inch of the top. Remove quickly and im- 
merse in the hot fat. When crisp and brown remove from 
the fat, turn the iron upside down to drain, then slip from 
the iron onto brown paper. Turn over and drain the 
inside. If the cases are soft, rather than crisp, the batter 
is too thick, and should be diluted with milk. 

Cucumber and Sweetbread Salad 

Prepare two pair of sweetbreads according to directions 
given on p. 138. Cool and cut into dice. Have ready an 
equal quantity of cucumber cubes standing in salted ice 



JANUABT MENUS 177 

water. Soak 2 T gelatine in J^ c cold water, then, dissolve 
in I c boiling water. Add 4 T lemon juice, salt and pep- 
per. While cooling whip i pint of double cream until stiff. 
Add the gelatine, the sweetbreads and the cucumbers. Fold 
all together, turn into moulds wet with cold water, either 
individual or one large mould. The latter should be square 
so that the salad may be cut in good serving pieces. Serve 
on a lettuce leaf with French Dressing or Mayonnaise. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

Mix I t mustard, i t salt, i t powdered sugar and a 
dash of cayenne with the yolks of 2 eggs ; then add, a 
few drops at a time, ij^ c olive oil. As the mixture thick- 
ens thin with 2 T lemon juice or 2 T vinegar, a few drops 
at a time at first, alternating with the oil. If desired, add 
J4 c cream, beaten stiff, or the whites of 2 eggs stiffly 
beaten, just before serving. 

In making Mayonnaise have the ingredients cold; if 
necessary set in ice water; work quickly, using a wooden 
spoon during the first part of the process, then a Dover 
egg-beater as the Dressing gets thick and heavy. If it 
begins to separate, break the yolk of an egg into another 
bowl and slowly beat the separated mixture into that. 

Imperial Cream 

Beat I quart of double cream stiff, add >4c powdered 
sugar and yi t salt; beat well. Cut and fold in 2 c dry 
cake crumbs and i c each candied pine-apple, cherries and 
nuts, cut fine. Set on the ice and serve very cold in 
sherbet glasses. 

Salted Almonds 

Blanche >4 pound of almonds according to directions 
given below: 

Process I: Place on a shallow pan in the oven, stir 
occasionally until a rich, golden brown. Remove from the 
oven, add i T butter and yi t salt. Stir well and turn out 
■on brown paper. 

Process II : Heat fat to 380 Fahr., or hot enough to 
brown bread in 20 seconds. Put the nuts into a frymg 
basket and lower into the hot fat until golden brown. Turn 
out onto brown paper and dust with salt. 



178 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Process III: Saute the nuts in 2 T butter until golden 
brown. Sprinkle with salt and turn out onto brown paper 
to dry. 

French Dressing " 

One-half t salt, J4 t mustard, J4 t pepper, dash cayenne, 
6 T olive oil, 6 T lemon juice or vinegar. Add the lemon 
juice or vinegar very slowly to the oil and seasoning, mixed 
together. Have all material and dishes very cold. 

Preparing the Luncheon 

Make the timbale cases the first thing in the morning. , 
Have the sweetbreads cooking while the timbales are being 
made. Soak the gelatine in cold water. Cut and dice the 
cucumbers and cover with boiling salted water; let stand i 
m; drain, and cover with salt ice water. Let stand until 
ready for use. Dissolve the gelatine and finish the salad. 
Blanch and salt the almonds. 

Prepare the cake crumbs, fruit and nuts for the dessert. 
If dry cake is not on hand vanilla wafers or macaroons 
may be used. Dry thoroughly and roll. 

Make the salad dressing. Prepare the lettuce, wrap in 
a damp cloth and keep in a cool place. Whip the cream 
for the dessert and prepare the table. Wash the oysters, 
measure the ingredients for the cream sauce. Make the 
sandwiches, put in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth. 

Measure the coffee, letting it stand in cold water. Sweeten 
the cream, add the fruit, and let stand in a cool place. 

When everything is ready, 10 m before time for serving 
prepare the oysters and heat the coffee.

SUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING THE COST OF 
JANUARY MEALS 

Use oleomargarine for cooking, top of milk for the cofifee 
and cereal, and half water in all recipes calling for milk. 

In Lesson 90 serve plain baked onions instead of 
creamed ; also substitute plain baked apples for apple f arci, 
omitting the cream. In Lesson 91 omit the lamb chops and 
use dry toast in place of cornmeal muffins. 

In Lesson 93 omit the celery and apple salad, also the 
sabyon sauce. Use % pound cheese in place of i can 
salmon with the spaghetti in Lesson 95. During the hunt- 
ing season if quails must be purchased for Lesson 96 sub- 
stitute I pound of veal steak, making mock pigeons. Also 
omit the green grape jelly. 

In Lesson 99 omit the cream sauce and in Lesson 100 
the oranges. In Lesson loi substitute plain bread for muf- 
fins, and in Lesson 102, 2 pounds lamb fricassee for 4 
pounds veal roast. The stuffing then will not be necessary. 
Also use creamed parsnips instead of parsnip timbales. 

In Lesson 105 serve plain lettuce instead of lettuce salad, 
omitting salad dressing throughout all the meals, or use 
"salad oil." In Lesson 106 use dry toast instead of date 
muffins. In Lesson 107 omit the egg and tomato jelly salad, 
and in 108 use i pint of oysters instead of i quart, adding 
more bread crumbs.

Part VI 



PLANNING OF MEALS 

Those who have followed the lessons thus far have pre- 
pared a considerable number of well-balanced meals. It is 
time that we considered some of the principles involved in 
the planning of such menus. 

It is hardly necessary ro say that meals should be planned 
several days ahead, each meal and each day hinging to the 
preceding one. In this way desirable combinations can be 
made with very little or no waste. If the meal is prepared 
without planning the housekeeper must use what she hap- 
pens to have on hand and a badly balanced meal and poor 
combinations too often result. Or if a market is near she 
is apt to get an expensive piece of meat which can be cooked 
quickly and easily. The bits of meat and vegetables left 
from the preceding day are often wasted, as there is not 
enough of any one to use and no thought has been given 
on how to combine them. In such cases the expense for 
food mounts up amazingly, the family is not satisfied or 
well nourished, and the housekeeper is hurried and worried. 

Let us take as a basis for the planning and preparation 
of meals, three points, — a balanced dietary, pleasing com- 
binations, and economy of time and money. 

Balanced Dietary 

It is not necessary to spend time figuring perfect balance 
of food principles in family meals, but it is necessary to 
have a general idea of the composition of foods (see Part 
I, page V, and pages 114-118), and to be careful that not 
too much protein, or fat, or starch and sugar be served in a 
meal. 

The following examples of combinations often served in 
poorly balanced meals will illustrate this point : 

18J 



188 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Beef, macaroni and cheese, peas, — too high in protein. 

Peasoup, meat, cheese, custard, — too high in protein. 

Beef or mutton, baked beans, Indian pudding, — too high 
in protein. 

Pork, fried potatoes, rich pudding with butter sauce, — 
too high in fat. 

Pork, vegetable with butter sauce, salad with mayonnaise 
dressing, whipped cream dessert, — too high in fat. 

Light meat, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, rice pudding, 
— too high in starch. 

Combination rice and meat, potatoes, beets, blanc mange, 
— too high in starch. 

Meat, candied sweet potatoes, jelly, kisses, and rich pre- 
serves, — too high in sugar. 

The tendency in well-to-do American families is to serve 
meals containing too high a proportion of protein and fat, 
and especially to serve too much. The total "food value" 
in the food eateq should depend chiefly on the amount of 
physical activity taken by members of the family. The 
menu for a farmer's family should contain more heavy, rich 
foods than that of a family in which the occupations are 
sedentary. The menus given in the Lessons are about an 
average, neither "very heavy or light. 

If the dinner is divided into four main courses — soup, 
meat, salad and dessert — plan to have two heavy and two 
light courses, such as cream soup, light meat, rich salad and 
light dessert ; or clear soup, heavy meat, light salad and rich 
dessert. In a three-course dinner, make two of the courses 
moderately heavy and the third light, or in a three-course 
luncheon or supper have two courses light and the third 
heavy. 

Pleasing Combinations 

That good digestion depends to a considerable extent on 
pleasurable taste in eating has been proved scientifically as 



FEBBUABY MENUS 183 

well as by the experience of the ages. It is true that "ap- 
petite is the best sauce" and that abundant outdoor exercise 
gives good appetite. But not everyone can have a keen 
appetite at all times, so that pleasing combinations are im- 
portant from the standpoint of health. 

Foods have the following characteristics or contrasts: 
Heavy or light; strong flavored or mild flavored; moist or 
dry ; crisp or soft ; acid or sweet ; hot or cold. 

A meal should have contrast and variety ; it should not be 
composed all of one kind of food, as all heavy or all strong 
flavored dishes, or all soft or all dry and so on. 

Mild flavored foods, like bread or potatoes, can be eaten 
in considerable quantities in a meal, but the appetite re-\folts 
at large amounts of strong flavored foods, like turnips, cauli- 
flower, game, cheese, etc. 

In simple combinations and made dishes the strong 
flavored food should be much less in quantity than the mild 
flavored food, as bread and cheese, macaroni and tomatoes, 
baked beans and ketchup. 

Creamed potatoes should not be served when there is 
gravy, but should be served with a dry meat. Moist meats 
such as stews, etc., should be served with dry vegetables. 
Plain sponge or butter cakes or cookies, not rich layer cakes, 
should be served with ice cream and whipped cream desserts, 
etc. Acid sauces should be served with rich puddings. 

In a well-planned dinner of five courses the soup should 
be light, giving a stimulant to the appetite; it should be 
served with croutons or crackers, which furnish dryness or 
crispness. If fish were used it should be light, served with 
an acid sauce or relish. The main course of meat would be 
heavy, fairly strong flavored. The vegetables would be 
soft and moist and in general mild flavored, "or only one 
strong in flavor. The salad should be crisp, cold and light, 
and the dessert warm, moderately heavy and sweet. 



184 LESSONS IN COOKING 

In a recent magazine article Miss Caroline Hunt gives 
the following comparison between the art of planning meals 
and the art of painting: 

"A well-planned meal has something in common with a 
well-designed painting. The latter usually consists of a 
background of neutral colors, relieved here and there by 
bits of bright color, known as high lights. The background 
may be a forest in browns and greens and the high light 
may be the sun finding a way to one spot through the trees ; 
or the background may be an expanse of sea and the high 
light, the foam on the crest of the waves. 

"A well-planned meal has its background also. This con- 
sists usually of neutrally flavored foods: breads, meats, 
cereals. These should be touched up like the painting and 
relieved by small quantities of food having pronounced 
flavor : acid fruits, vinegar, capers, sweets. 

"Of the painting, it is idle to try to say whether its suc- 
cess is due more to background than to high lights or vice 
versa. The background sets off the bright bits of color and 
keeps them from clashing one with another ; the bits of color 
give charm to the somber expanse. So, too, with the meal. 
The breads, meats and cereals are the substantial part and 
absolutely necessary not only for health but also for the 
purpose of keeping the foods of pronounced flavor from 
clashing. The flavoring materials, on the other hand, are 
necessary oftentimes to make the more solid foods attractive 
and palatable, and authorities tell us now that good digestion 
waits on appetite." 

As in other arts, it is not possible to give definite and 
specific rules for the planning of successful meals. How- 
ever, keeping in mind the suggestions given, and with care- 
ful observation, the housekeeper should succeed in planning 
appetizing and wholesome meals. 



FEBBUABY MENUS 185 

Economy 

The greatest economy can be obtained in the household 
by (i) buying just enough for one meal of expensive foods, 
or those that cannot be done over, for example, lamb chops 
and such fresh vegetables as cauliflower ; (2) using of left- 
overs in made dishes, and a judicious cooking of foods in 
such quantities that they may be used in this way when 
desired; for example, in cooking rice for supper, cook 
enough to have casserole of rice and meat, or rice croquettes, 
etc., the next day, and possibly a rice cream pudding for the 
second or third day. If the character and appearance of 
the dish is entirely changed, no objection will be made to 
the same food being served several days in succession. This 
takes planning and until one, is used to it a little more work, 
but most acceptable and nutritious dishes will result when 
these leftovers are used intelligently. 

In buying meat plan a way to use as a leftover what can 
not be eaten after the first cooking. If, for instance, a por- 
terhouse steak is purchased, the tough end is usually left. 
By buying a little piece of round steak or some other 
coarser meat, say 5 cents worth, there will be enough for 
some made dish. Plan the vegetables two days ahead and 
cook in such quantity as will serve the purpose. Leftover 
potatoes can always be used to advantage, and it takes no 
more time or fuel to boil eight potatoes than four potatoes. 
This applies also to such vegetables as turnips, squash, etc. 
For instance, plan today to have creamed turnips; when 
boiled take out enough for turnip souffle for the next 
day or the day after, and so with other vegetables. If there 
are a few spoonfuls of a vegetable left, apparently not 
enough for any one dish, study the combinations with other 
vegetables, such as beans and corn, carrots and peas, peas 
and potatoes, tomatoes and corn, etc., and make them up 
into croquettes, scalloped dishes, etc., or put them into soups. 



186 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Even if your market does afford vegetables and fruits out 
of season, use them very rarely, for they are expensive and 
of poor flavor, and by the time they are in season and in 
good quality the appetite may no longer care for them. 

A point to be observed in planning a meal by those using 
gas, gasoline, etc., is the manner of cooking the various 
dishes. If, for example, the meat is to be roasted, the oven 
has to be heated, and consequently as many things should be 
cooked in the oven as possible; or if on top of the stove, 
plan to make one burner do the work of two or three by 
boiling and steaming. In this way economy in fuel will 
result.. This, of course, does not apply so much to those 
using coal or wood stoves. 



Menu Suggestion Cards 

It is hard on the spur of the moment to think of the 
good things we know or of which we have heard. To help 
the memory the following suggestions may be of assistance : 

Prepare one large card or a series of small cards on the 
plan of the samples following, and when a desirable dish 
is thought of set it down under its proper heading, with the 
reference to the recipe and a word to describe the charac- 
ter. When planning menus glance over the card and you 
will almost always get some suggestion or help. If the 
small cards are used, keep in a small filing box in a con- 
venient place.

SCHOOL LUNCHEONS 

A luncheon for a school child should be prepared from 
two standpoints — wholesomeness and attractiveness. Only 
those foods which are nutritious and easily digested should 
be considered. The selection of food that is to be eaten 
cold requires much greater thought than that to be eaten 
hot. The nature of the child must also be taken into con- 
sideration. A quiet child who sits still most of the day 
should have lighter food than the robust, hearty child who 
romps and plays. The luncheons should be planned and 
prepared for days ahead just as the regular menus for the 
family, making the two fit in together. 



188 LESSONS IN COOKING 

The lunch box when opened should present an appetizing 
and attractive appearance. Food that cannot be packed or 
carried well should never be used. Each article should be 
packed by itself and all fitted in neatly and carefully. 

The following list of articles will be found most useful 
in preparing the luncheon : 



A light lun^h box, or a basket well lined with paper. 

Oiled or parafine paper. 

Tiny screw-top jar for salt. 

Larger screw-top jar for preserves. 

Small spoon. 

Collapsible drinking cup. 

Paper napkins. 



There are a few points to be observed in regard to the 
food itself. 

Pie should be eliminated for two reasons — its unwhole- 
someness, and the fact that it cannot be carried well. Eggs 
should be cooked at a. low temperature for a long time to 
make them digestible, and should be left in the shell. Sand- 
wiches should have the crust left on and be wrapped sepa- 
rately in oiled paper. Be careful not to use any filling for 
a sandwich the, odor of which will permeate the lunch box. 
Chopped meat is much better to use lihan sliced meat, as it 
is more convenient and also more digestible, since a child 
seldom chews the meat as he ought to. Nut butter and 
chopped nuts make very nutritious and appetizing . sand- 
wiches. Soft, rich cakes are not so good as brittle cookies. 
Oatmeal and graham crackers frosted make pleasant 
changes. 

Nuts are a valuable addition to the lunch box, furnishing 
not only nutrition but also attractiveness. A bit of sweet 
in the way of candy or chocolate, dates or figs may well be 



FEBBUAET MENUS 189 

used instead of cake. The Parisian Sweets, given on page 
1 20, are exceptionally nice for this purpose. 

In putting fresh fruit into a lunch box, be careful to so 
wrap it that its odor will not penetrate the other food. 
Especial care needs to be taken with bananas. 

THE WORKER'S LUNCH BOX 

The rules cited for the school luncheon will apply to the 
workers, but the character of the work done must be taken 
into consideration, and the kind and amount of food gov- 
erned accordingly. Heavier, bulkier and more nutritious 
food should be used for the out-of-door or manual worker, 
such as baked bean sandwiches, meats of all kinds, cheese, 
raw and in the form of rarebits, and fondue for sandwich 
filling; eggs, hard cooked, fried or salad; small cans of 
sardines, doughnuts; cookies, especially oatmeal; ginger- 
bread, cinnamon rolls, etc. In such case use, if possible, the 
dinner pails which are divided into sections and places pre- 
pared for keeping coffee and tea hot. 

For one of sedentary occupation a light and digestible 
but very nutritious lunch should be provided. Among these 
may be mentioned meat sandwiches in which the meat is 
ground, mixed with light relishes and salad dressing; egg 
sandwiches or salad or hard cooked eggs, cream cheese 
mixed with chopped olives and pimentoes, chopped fruit 
and nut sandwiches, light cookies and sweets, with nuts 
and fruit.

TriE (-OltltKCT I'dSITKlN AM) M K'rnon FOR KNEADING BREAD. 



FEBBUABY MENUS 211 

BREAD MAKING 

Yeast breads take their names from the flour or the liquid 
isedj as white bread, whole wheat bread, or graham, and. 
.ccording to. the liquid as, milk bread, water bread, milk and 
vater bread, or potato bread. A combination of any two, 
»r all of the liquids may be used. Potato, water, made by- 
nashing three or four potatoes to about i quart of the- 
vater in which they are cooked, is preferred by many, as' 
t seems to produce a moister bread and quicker action from' 
he yeast. 

Thd proportion of shortening and sugar used in the bi"ead' 
lepends upon' the tastes" of the breadmaker or family. Too 
nuch shortening will slightly retard the action of the yeast,, 
IS will also too much salt or sugar. The following propor- 
ions giye exciellent results — 2 or 3 loaves : ; 

Milk and Water Bread 

i c-milk . . ' i t sugar 

i c water or potato water ,j4 to i yeast cake soft- 

2 t; shortening , ened in )4 c tepid water 

2 t SALT. FLOUR 

There are two processes for making bread, the long and, 
Jie short, either of which can be used according to time 
md convenience. In both, the method of procedure is the 
;ame up to a certain, point. 

The liquid used should be brought to the boiling poitit.. 
To this add the sugar, salt and . shortening. When cooled to 
[00° (lukewarm),, add the yeast which has been soaking in 
:epid water. Then add enough flour to make a batter that 
ivill drop from the, spoon (about 6 c to the above propor- 
:ions), and beat very well. From this point either the long 
jr short process can be employed according to the con- 
venience and desire of the breadmaker. 



21;J LESSONS IN COOKING 

Long Process 

Set the above batter or "sponge" in a warm place, the 
best temperature being from 70° to 90° F, and let rise to 
double its bulk, which will take from i to 2 h at 80° or 
over night at 65°. Then sift in sufficient flour to make a 
dough which can be handled ; turn out onto a floured board, 
knead well, adding flour when necessary, to prevent stick- 
ing, until the dough is smooth, elastic, and can be kneaded 
for several minutes without the addition of flour. The 
dough should not stick to the board, it may cleave, but not 
stick. Put into a well greased bowl, either turning it over 
in the bowl, or rubbing it on the top with a little fat to 
prevent the formation of a dry crust. Cover, set in a 
warm place and let rise to double its bulk. Turn out on 
a board, using no flour, or as little as possible ; knead well, 
mold into loaves which will not quite half fill the pans, and 
put into greased pans, greasing the top as before. Let rise 
to double its bulk and bake. 

Short Process 

Instead of setting this batter Or sponge to rise, flour i& 
added to make a stiff dough. This is turned out onto the 
board, kneaded and set to rise. When double its bulk, it 
is kneaded down, put into the pans, allowed to rise and then 
baked as in the long process. 

The texture and flavor of the bread may be improved by 
kneading down more than once before baking, but very 
excellent bread can be made with two kneadings if time 
and inclination do not permit of more. 

Yeasts 

Compressed yeast has very quick action and with it bread 
can be made and baked in from 3 to 6 h, if the dough is 
kept at 75° to 90°. The more yeast used and the higher the 
temperature the quicker is the action. Care should be taken 
however, that the yeast is fresh and in good condition. 

The dried yeast cakes artd the home made yeasts give 
as good results, but take longer than the compressed yeasts. 



FEBEUABY MENUS 2^9 

The action of the yeast in the bread is to produce the gas 
carbon dioxide (CO2) and alcohol. First some of the 
starch is acted upon by an enzyme in the flour and changed 
into sugar, which is subsequently changed by the yeast into 
carbon dioxide and alcohol. When a certain amount of 
these two have been produced they act on the yeast, stop 
its growth and finally kill it, after which time no more 
alcohol and carbon dioxide can be produced. Then bacteria 
such as those producing acetic acid become active and sour 
bread results. 

To prevent this, as soon as the dough has doubled its 
bulk, which is an indication that as much alcohol and car- 
bon dioxide as is safe is present, it should be kneaded down 
to permit the escape of the gas. If at this point one ha? 
not time to knead it, it can be slashed through several times 
with a knife, or torn apart, to effect the same result. 

As yeast is a plant, it is necessary to keep the dough at 
the proper temperature to obtain desired results. For quick 
action it should be kept warm by setting in a warm place, 
in warm water or by wrapping the bowl. If the" tempera- 
ture is too low, the action is slow and the dough may not 
rise sufficiently in time for baking. If it is too high, there 
is greater tendency for the dough to sour. A thermometer 
is a great help in controlling the temperature. A common 
bath thermometer with large stem can be obtained at most 
drug stores for 25 cents. When used it should be taken 
out of the wooden case and thrust into the dpugh. 

When it is desired to postpone the baking, the dough may 
be set in a cool place, between 50° and 60°, to prevent 
further rising and loaves or biscuits made when wanted 
or when convenient, allowed to rise in the pan and baked. 
It is often desirable to hold a part of the dough over night 
or longer, to have hot biscuits for breakfast or other meal. 



tU LESSONS IN COOKING 

Kneading 

Kneading is for the purpose of mixing and perfectly 
blending all the ingredients so that the yeast will be 
thoroughly distribute throughout the entire mass, and the 
action be the same in all parts of the dough, thus making 
the texture fine and even throughout. The first kneading 
mixes and blends the materials, the last perfects the grain. 
The action of kneading should be such as to get the 
greatest results from the least expenditure of energy by the 
worker; in other words, to make each motion count to its 
fullest extent. The dough should be folded toward one, 
rolled away, moving the entire mass under the hands at the 
same moment. The action consists of three montions: ist, 
folding (the dough is folded toward one), 2nd, rolling 
(rolled away from one under pressure of the hands), 3rd, 
turning (the dough is turned quickly so that it lays length- 
wise from the kneader). This seems a complicated action, 
but if practiced, becomes very simple. Punching and pound- 
ing dough is useless waste of energy, affecting only a very 
small portion of the dough with each strenuous motion. 
It is not so much the time given to the kneading as the 
way it is done which counts, for more can be accomplished 
by kneading- in the proper way for 5 m than in double or 
treble that time by misdirected motions. 

Bread Mixers 

Bread mixers may be used to advantage and will save 
much time and energy if one finds turning a crank easier 
than kneading. Housekeepers inexperienced in bread mak- 
ing usually have better success with a bread mixer than in 
kneading by hand. There is not so much danger of adding 
too much Hour, thus making a very stiff dough which does 
not rise properly and gives a tough, hard loaf. 



FEBBUASy MENUS tlG 

Baking 

Baking bread kills the yeast plant, prevents further fer- 
mentation, expands the gas, thus making the bread light, 
sets the gluten cell walls, and develops the flavor. Thor- 
ough baking is absolutely necessary to produce good, whole- 
some, digestible bread. A pound loaf should bake i h in a 
moderate oven, a pan of biscuit, according to their size, 
from 20 to 30 m. 

If the oven is too hot when the bread is put in there will 
be heavy streaks through it, and the crust will burst at the 
point of least resistance, usually along the top or side. 

Loaves should be small, not over a pound in weight and 
should be baked in separate pans, so that the heat will pene- 
trate quickly and thoroughly to the center of the loaf. The 
best sized pan is 4x8x3 inches. 

Care of Bread After Baking 

After baking turn the bread out and lay on a wire cake 
cooler or a rack in such a way that the air will circulate 
freely all around it. When cold put into a fin bread box 
or a stone Jar, and cover tightly. 

Under no circumstances use a cloth around bread. It 
absorbs the moisture, will very soon have an odor, and will 
give a taste to the bread. If one desires to wrap the bread 
use brown paper, such as manilla. The bread box or jar 
should be scalded and aired at least once a week.

HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS 
Soiled Dish Retainer 

In a small family where economy of time is important, 
it is often advisable to wash the dishes but once a day. 
Some way, however, must be provided whereby the used 
dishes may be kept out of sight. The following suggestions 
may be found useful for this purpose : 

Procure a wooden box, size about i8 x 24 x 12 inches, 
and have the man of the family make a lid for it, which 
should be hinged to the back. Now line it, lid and all, with 
tin, or, better still, zinc. If this cannot be done at home 
take it to a tinner. Paint or varnish the outside. This is 
now a water tight, vermin proof receptacle in which the 
lishes may be kept in water until a convenient time for 
washing. 

Keep the box in any available space in the kitchen. A 
shelf may be made under the sink or the kitchen table for it, 
3r it may be kept in the pantry. 

If one does not' care to go to as much expense as the 
above involves, two dish pans of large size may be used. 
The dishes should be piled in one and covered with the 
Dther. 

If there are only a few dishes, the dishpan containing 
them may be put into the. oven of a gas range. 

Paper Towels 

The tissue tov>fe!s now on the market are a great con- 
i^enience in dishwashing. In quantities, they cost about one- 
lifth of a cent each in rolls and about one-fifteenth of a 
rent each in sheets, 12x18 inches. They should be used 
Dnly with dry handy on dishes and silver that have been 
tvell drained. With this precaution, the towels may be 
dried and used a number of times like linen towels, until 
:hey become soiled, when they are thrown away. This 
>aves the task of washing dish towels. 

[gleaning Silver 

One of the latest inventions for removing the tarnish 
trom metal articles, particularly silver and silver plate and 
jold. is a set of two zinc pans, one with a perforated bottom 



FEBSUABY MENUS 217 

placed inside the other. The silver is laid in the pan, 
covered with . boiling water to which salt and soda have 
been added, allowed to stand several minutes, or, if very 
black, boiled 5 minutes, removed from the water and 
rinsed thoroughly. All tarnish disappears as if by magic. 
The silver has a frosted appearance which comes bright 
with very little rubbing. 




SILVER-CLEAN PAN (Price $2.00) 

• 

If one does not care to invest in such a device as the 
above, about the same results may be accomplished by boil- 
ing the silver in a granite pan with pieces of zinc in the 
water and with salt and soda added in the proportion of 
I tablespoonful salt and i tablespoonful cooking soda to each 
quart of water. Or an old aluminum dish may be used. 

The action is an electro chemical one. The soda in the 
presence of silver acts on the zinc or aluminum slightly, 
producing a little hydrogen, which changes the oxides and 
sulphides of silver, which make the tarnish, back into silver, 
so that even silver-plate is not harmed. 

To Prevent Discoloration of Fruit 

To keep fresh pared fruit, such as apples, peaches, 
bananas, etc., from discoloring, wrap well in tissue, waxed 
or manilla paper, and set in a cool place.

In a thermos bottle with a capacity of i quart, two dif- 
ferent liquids of the same temperature may be carried by 
the following method: The opening of this size bottle 
is about I inch in diameter. Hence a test tube ^ inch in 
difimeter, and lo inches long, holding approximately 8 
ounces, yi pint, may be filled, sealed with a cork 
dipped in melted paraffin, and inserted in the large bottle 
into which the other liquid has already been poured. Thus 
in this way lemon juice, for example, and milk, may each 
be carried in the same bottle. 

To Slice Bacon Thin 

To be assured of thinly sliced bacon, ask the butcher to 
cut it with the dried beef sheer. It is particularly nice to 
have it sliced in this way when it is desired to use the 
bacon for wrapping oysters, etc. 

To Cream Butter for Cake 

When creaming butter and sugar for cake, especially if 
making in large quantities, use a wire potato masher. It 
will produce excellent results in a short time and with little 
expenditure of energy. 

Using Beets in Mince Meat 

If apples are scarce whin making mince meat, substitute 
boiled beets, chopped fine. The result is very good indeed. 

To Prepare Fruit for Salads 

It is very easy to prepare fruit for marmalade, salads, 
etc., if a large pair of scissors ^re. used. Slice the fruit 
first, then cut into small pieces with the scissors. 

Cold cooked meats and vegetables may also be prepared 
for salads, etc., in this way. 

Emergency Cakes 

Graham or oatmeal crackers frosted make very acceptable 
;mergency cakes. 

To Keep Cheese from Drying 

If it is found necessary to keep a large piece of cheese 
for any length of time, pour melted paraffin over the cut 
surface. As the cheese is used this seal may be repeated.

MARKETING AND CUTS OF MEAT 

The best way to study marketing and the cuts of meat is 
to go right to the market, select the meat and ask questions 
of the butcher. If this is done in the right way a great deal 
of valuable information can be obtained. The average 
[lousekeeper knows two or three cuts of meat, namely, the 
round, porterhouse and rib roast. Some of the most nutri- 
tious cuts are the cheapest, and if one knows how to cook 
them properly, these will be much more satisfactory than 
;ome of the most expensive cuts. 

The following is a list of the cuts arranged according to 
arice and use :

The tenderloin is the long tender muscle that lies under 
he back bone. It is very tender, and has a delicate flavor 
)ut contains no fat. In the best beef it is sliced with the 
jorterhouse and sirloin steaks, but with the poorer beef it is 
emoved whole and sold either as a fillet, or sliced. It 
should be larded, baked at a low temperature, _ and served 
•are. It is the most expensive and least nutritious in pro- 
jortion to the cost, of all the cuts of beef. 

The porterhouse are the cuts of steak lying between the 
-ibs and the hip bone. The back bone forms a T shape and 
lence they are sometimes called the T-bone steaks. 

The sirloin steaks begin with the hip bone and contain a 
jiece of it as well as part of the back bone. These as well 
IS the porterhouse are tender steaks, can be cooked quickly, 
ind should be served rare. 

221 



222 LESSONS IN COOKING 

The rump': steak, requiring a peculiar ' cutting, is , rarely 
offered for sale in the ordinary markets, but is a delicioifis, 
steak. ' 

■ The round, cut from the thigh and containing a small 
piece of bone, is one of the commonest cuts. The first cuts 
of the round may be used as a steak when taken from good, 
beef, but usually it is not tender enough to permit of quick 
cooking. However, it is one of the most nutritious and 
cheapest cuts of -the animal and lends itself to a great variety 
of ways in cooking. 

Flank steak, of which there are only two steaks in each 
beef, lies to the front of the hind leg on the flank. It is a 
flat muscle and the grain runs with the cut instead of across 
it. It is not used as much as it should ^be, for it is very 
rich in flavor and nutriment. By rolling and slicing it 
across the grain, it can be cooked as an ordinary steak, and, 
served rare. Like round, it can be made very delicious and 
tender when subjected to long, slow cooking. 

The skirt steak is similar to the flank and can be cooked 
in the same way. 

For oven roasts, the fillet, rib, and loin are the best. The 
rib roast when bought with rib on, is called a standing rib 
roast. When the rib has been removed and the roast is 
rolled it is called a rolled rib roast. 

For pot roasts the rump and round are the best, being 
solid pieces of meat without much bone and having excel- . 
lent flavor. The shoulder and flank rank next. 

For stews and, casseroles and other cooking at low tem- 
peratures the tougher cuts can be used the same as in pot 
roasi. 

In mutton, lamb, veal, and pork, the cuts are much the 
same, the chop in each case corresponding to the rib roast 
and . porterhouse steak of the beef. The leg furnishes 
steaks corresponding to the round steaks of the beef, but 
are generally used for roasts. The tougher parts are used 
for stews, etc.

Mock Duck 

Select a fore quarter of mutton with the whole length of 
the leg bone left on. Ask the butcher to cut off what is 
called a raised shoulder, that is, raised from the back bone 
and ribs, cutting it far up on the shoulder to take in the 
whole of the shoulder blade, bone and gristle. Scrape the 



MARCH WSNUS 225 

flesh from the shoulder blade, and separate the blade at 
the joint. Lay aside for further use. Remove the meat 
from the leg bone, turning it over as you would turn a 
glove wrong side out over the hand. Be careful not to cut 
through the thin skin at the end of the leg bone. When 
within 3 inches of th,e lower joint, saw the bone off and 
trim below the joint into the shape of a duck's bill. Bend 
the joint without breaking the skin. Wipe the meat and 
rub inside with salt. 

Make a moist stuffing of i c breadcrumbs, % t each salt, 
pepper, thyme, and moisten with % c butter melted with 
J^ c water, and put in between the layers of meat. 

With a coarse needle threaded with twine gather the 
edges of meat, draw them together, fill the cavity with 
stuffing, and shape the meat into a long oval form like the 
body of a duck. 

Bend the leg at the lower joint to represent the duck's 
head and neck, and keep it in place with skewers. Run 
one skewer through the side at the top of the body and put 
one into the body on each side of the neck. Wind a string 
around the bill, and fasten it to the skewers. Scrape the 
shoulder blade clean, trim the lower end into a sharp point, 
and notch the gristle at the opposite end. Insert this into 
the body to represent the tail, and fasten with twine. 

Put the bones and scraps of meat into a kettle of water 
and steam the duck over it for i h to make it tender. 
Dredge with salt, pepper, and flour and bake for i h or 
until tender and brown. Use the water from the kettle for 
basting if necessary. Tie paper over the head and tail to 
keep from burning.

ANGEL CAKE COFFEE 

Color Scheme — Pink and Green. 

Table Arrangement 

The table may be left uncovered and doilies used, or be 
covered with pad and table cloth. The chafing dish, with 
accessories, spoon, flagon and match box, should be ar- 
ranged on a large tray at one end. The supplies to be used 
in cooking should be placed in attractive dishes around 
the tray, having everything there in the way of salt, pepper, 
etc. Knives, forks, spoons and measuring cup should be 
arranged neatly at the side ready for use. The service dish 
for the entire company should be placed in the center, just 
beyond the chafing dish. To the left of the plates should 
stand the platter containing the timbale cases; at the right 
the platter containing the salad wafers ; fork, two spoons, 
glass and napkin should be at each place. Salt and pepper 
shakers should be placed for every two guests. 

The sandwiches should be on four plates on different 
parts of the table ; the cake should be cut and placed on the 
sideboard; the angelica cut very fine and the cherries in 
halves, ready to be sprinkled on the sherbet when served. 

The coffee service should be on a large tray on a side 
table or on the sideboard. 

The table decoration should be in pink and green and 
should consist of a low center piece. 

Salmon HoUandaise 

In the blazer of the chafing dish cream J^ c butter, add 
the yolks of 2 eggs, one at a time ; beat well and add slowly 
the juice of 5^ lemon, %. t salt and a speck of cayenne 
pepper. Then add 3^ c boiling water, very slowly, ij4 c 
salmon, flaked, and J4 c French peas. Cook over hot 
water until the mixture thickens like custard. Serve in 
timbale cases.

3^mbale Cases 

Beat 2 eggs slightly, add i c milk. Sift i c flour and ^ t 
salt together. Add enough of the egg and milk to make a 
batter than can be beaten smooth and velvety, then add the 
rest of the liquid. Fry with a timbale iron in deep fat. 
See p. 176 for timbale frying. 

Wafers 

Beat I egg until light, add j4 t salt, and enough flour to 
make a very stiff dough. Roll dut until as thin as paper, 
cut into triangles about ij4 inch on each side. Fry in hot 
fat. If rolled thin enough they will curl up, making very 
odd shapes. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt. 
Fill with the following mixture.- 

Olive, Pimento and Cheese Filling 

Cut the meat from i pint of olives and chop fine. Add 3 
pimentoes, finely shredded, and i package Neufchatel 
cheese. Mix well and fill the wafers. 

Note — Pimentoes should be bought in the small cans. 
After the can is opened if there are any pimetoes unused 
turn them into a bowl and cover with the oil in which they 
were packed, and keep in a cool place. They mould very 
easily. 

Lemon Sherbet 

Soak I T gelatine in J4 c cold water 10 m; add i^ c 
boiling water, and when the gelatine is dissolved add 2 c 
sugar, juice of 6 lemons and 2 c cold water. Mix all well 
together and start to freeze, using i part salt to 2 parts 
crushed ice. When partly frozen but still soft, fold in the 
stiffly beaten whites of 2 eggs. Cover and continue freez- 
ing until the mixture is stiff. Repack and set away to ripen 
for at least 2 h. 

Angel Cake 

Beat iJ/S c of egg whites until frothy, add i t cream of 
tartar and beat till stiff, then add gradually ij^ c sifted 
sugar and i t vanilla. Mix and sift four times i c pastry 
flour and J4 t salt, then carefully fold into the egg and 
sugar mixture. Turn into an unbuttered angel cake pan. 
Bake 40 to 45 m. in a slow oven. After the cake has risen 



MAECE MENUS 247 

and begins to brown, cover with a buttered paper to keep 
the top from becoming too brown. When done invert pan 
until the cake is cool. 

Preparing the Supper 

The timbale cases and salad wafers should be prepared 
in the morning and at the same time so that they may both 
be fried while the fat is hot. The cake also should be 
baked in the morning. The sherbet should be made at least 
2 h before using. Then the sandwiches may be made, 
packed in a bowl and covered with a damp cloth. Then the 
salad mixture made. Prepare the angelica and cherries, 
then arrange the table. 

Measure and prepare the ingredients to be used in the 
salmon hollandaise, and place, on the table. In preparing 
the salmon drain off the oil, then remove all of the bones 
and skin from the fish, and separate into small pieces. 
Drain the liquor from a can of peas, turn into a sieve and 
rinse well with cold water. Put the sherbet glasses in a 
cold place. When everything is ready fill the salad wafers 
and place them on the table; also the timbale cases. Make 
the coffee, put the cream and sugar on the coffee tray, cut 
the cake and place on a side table. Then serve the sand- 
wiches. Put hot water in the water bath and light the 
chafing dish stove. Seat the guests and begin the prepara- 
tion of the hollandaise. 

When the first course has been finished, remove the 
chafing dish and soiled dishes. Place the coffee tray and 
the cake on the table, serve the sherbet and pour the coffee.

HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS 

Chafing Dishes 

In selecting a chafing dish be sure that the lamp can be 
removed from the standard without disturbing the cooker. 
This is a great convenience as well as being at times a neces- 
sity, as there may be something cooking in the dish which 
should not be disturbed and the alcohol need replenishing. 

The lamp should be so made that the flame can be easily 
and well regulated, thus increasing or reducing the heat as 
desired. 

The chafing dish consists of the water bath and blazer, 
the latter being the pan in which the cooking is usually 
done. Generally the blazer only is provided with a long 
handle, while the water bath has two short ones. It would 
be much more convenient to have the long handles on both 
pans. This can occasionally be found. 

A flagon with which to fill the lamp, a fork, a spoon and 
a skimmer are quite necessary adjuncts to a chafing dish. 
The whole should be placed on a large tray both for safety 
and cleanliness. 

In using the water bath be careful not to put in too 
much water, as otherwise it will boil over. 

While cooking always have a plate on which to lay the 
soiled utensils, and a second one on which to place the lid 
when it is removed from the chafing dish. 

Carving at Table 

Allow the carver plenty of room and put the roast on a 
platter ample in size, so placed that it need not be moved 
by the carver, or as follows : A rib roast of beef — Ends of 
the ribs at the right ; leg of lamb or ham — small leg bone at 
left; turkey or chicken — with drum sticks at the right; rib 
of pork, etc. — ends of the ribs towards the carver. A thin 
rolled rib roast is usually laid flat and sliced towards the 
carver, with the guard on the carving fork up. 

The carving knife and fork should lay, preferably on the 
carving rest, the fork at the left and the knife at the rigHt. 
See that the knife is sharp. 

In carving the fork should be inserted in the best pos- 
sible position to hold the meat securely, then the meat cut 



MARCH M'ENUS 249 

in thin slices across the grain. This means parallel with ribs 
and at right angles to the leg bone. If the carver wishes 
to make a success of his work he should study the cuts 
of meat carefully, examining the muscles and noting the 
way in which the grain runs, so that he caii cut across it in 
carving. 

The slices when cut should be laid at one end of the 
platter ready for serving. 

The meat before being brought to the table should be 
carefully examined to see that there are no strings or 
skewers left in it. 

If possible have the butcher crack the bones in such a 
way that the meat will be easy to carve. For instance, 
in a porterhouse steak, if the back bone is cracked in about 
three places the carver can cut straight through, thus serv- 
ing a bit of the tenderloin with each piece. In case of a rib 
roast if the bone can be broken between each rib it will 
greatly facilitate carving. 

In carving a turkey or chicken, it is usual first to re- 
move the leg and wing furthest away from the carver, 
then the other leg and wing, after which the breast is cut 
in thin slices, first on one side and then on the other. 
In a small family, if only half a turkey is to be served, one 
side may be left untouched. 
Amounts to Serve 

Taking twelve as a unit, the following amounts will be 
adequate for light refreshments : 

One and one-half loaves of bread, counting 24 half slice 
sandwiches to the loaf. 

^3 pound of butter well creamed before using. 

yi pound coffee to 18 c water will make double service. 

From ^ to I pint cream will be sufficient. 

3 pints of salad should be allowed. 

1^3 bricks or 3 pints bulk ice cream should be allowed. 

54 pound salted nuts. 

A cake 12 inches square will cut 36 pieces ; 8 inches square 
will cut 16 pieces ; 9 inches in diameter will cut 24 pieces.

Uses of the Dover Egg Beater 

A large size Dover egg beater will be found a great con- 
venience in the household for use in various ways. Custard 
inclined to curdle can frequently be made smooth by beating 
vigorously a few minutes with the egg beater. Lumpy 
saUces or gravies may also be made smooth by this method. 
Salad dressing is much more delicate and light if beaten 
well with an egg beater before using. Cream may be 
whipped beautifully by placing in a Mason or some other 
kind of deep jar and beating with a Dover beater. 

Tongue in Mince Meat 

Mince pies made from mince meat in which boiled tongue 
and no suet has been used will be found to be entirely free 
from any tallowy taste when served cold. 

Fireless Cooker Substitute 

A good substitute for a fireless cooker will be found in a 
thick earthen casserole. The food to be cooked is placed in 
the casserole, which is then covered and set in a hot oven. 
As soon as the dish and contents are thoroughly hot, the 
fire is either turned out completely, or turned very low, and 
the heat retained by the earthen dish cooks the food. 

Uses for a Wire Frying Basket 

A wire frying basket is of great service in cooking pota- 
toes, vegetables of all kinds, eggs, etc. The articles to be 
cooked are placed in the basket, lowered into hot water, and 
when done are easily removed all at once by lifting the 
basket out of the water. In this way they are also easily 
and perfectly drained. 

An Alarm Clock — Housekeeper's Assistant 

An alarm clock can be made to be an extremely useful 
assistant to the housewife. If she has something in the oven 
which will need attention in the course of lo or 15 minutes, 
and she wishes to do some work in another part of the 
house, the alarm set for the proper time will relieve her of 
all anxiety and call her when needed. This is only one 
illustration of the many uses to which it may be put.

PART VIII 



KITCHEN CONVENIENCES AND APPLIANCES 

Study the arrangement of the kitchen so that every arti- 
cle and piece of furniture will be in the most convenient 
place, and the work done\with the least expenditure of time 
and energy. The following suggestions can be applied in 
principle in every kitchen : 

1. The kitchen should be large enough for the work that 
is to be done there, but it should not contain a square inch 
of waste space. The size will vary with different condi- 
tions, but the working space should always be kept as small 
as possible. 

There should be a cross draft of air and a ventilator in 
the ceiling, if possible. 

2. Utilize the wall space of the kitchen for shelves and 
cupboards, instead of having a pantry with its open shelves, 
extra floor space, etc. Have a capboard for the cooking 
utensils near the stove, one for supplies and mixing dishes 
near the table; make them shallow enough so that every- 
thing can be seen at a glance, and have the shelves set far 
enough apart to accommodate the dishes, etc., but near 
enough to avoid waste of space. 

3. Have enough shelf room, if possible, to set utensils of 
different sizes and shapes separately. 

4. Keep ail supplies in jars, glass preferably, which 
should then be labeled. 

5. A shelf over or near the stove, for coffee can and 
coffee pot, tea can and tea pot, salt, pepper, flour dredge, 
etc., is a very great convenience. 

6. Raise the kitchen table and the sink to a height six 
inches below the waist line. This will lessen the strain of 
work wonderfully, and put an end to the aching back. 

7. Drop shelves, which can be dropped out of the way 
when not needed, and raised to make extra tahle space when 
necessary, will help exceedingly in a small kitchen. 

253 



254 LESSONS IN COOKING 

8. A thick rug, made of washable or replaceable mate- 
rial, laid where the worker stands in front of the table, will 
be a great comfort. Many thicknesses of newspaper cov- 
ered on both sides with building paper and secured at the 
edges with adhesive tape makes a very good one. 

9. A separate hook for every article — no two things on 
the same hook — will save the disposition. 

10. A waste paper basket should stand in an inconspicu- 
ous place. 

11. Instead of a kitchen table drawer filled with every- 
thing, substitute the following: 

a. A set of pockets, each one labeled, hung on the back of 

a door, for string, corks, etc., large ones for paper 
sacks, etc. 

b. A leather strap tacked on the inside of a cupboard door 

to hold carving and kitchen knives and forks. Tack 
at intervals so that each article has its particular 
socket. Leave one for a carborundum knife sharpener. 

c. Two square hooks near the sink, screwed on a line, to 

hold the paring knife. It is so convenient while 
standing at the sink to reach up for the knife rather 
than to search through a drawer filled with every- 
thing. 

12. Hang a pair of scissors on two hooks in a convenient 
place. 

13. A pin cushion, with a linen cover, which can be 
removed and washed, should hang in an accessible place. 

14. A light over the stove will relieve the strain of trying 
to see in the dark, often caused by the necessity of standing 
in one's own light. 

15. A lid rack with graduated spaces for the lids, the 
small ones in the front, with the large ones to the back, 
should be placed near the stove. 

16. A large, light-weight tray should be kept in a con- 
venient place, ready for use. One of the best devices is the • 
wheel tray, which is a rack on wheels, carying one or two 
large trays. 

17. A book shelf for cook books, a clock, a pad with 
pencil attached for memoranda, and a roll of tissue or 
toweling paper for wiping out especially greasy or soiled 
dishes or utensils, should be in every kitchen. 



APEIL MENUS 255 

i8. The floor of a kitchen should be made as easy to 
stand on as possible. Linoleum over a wooden floor will 
be found most convenient. Let the linoleum run up on 
the base board, over a concave quarter round, thus elimi- 
nating the corner between the wall and the floor. 

If the linoleum is shellaced or varnished once a year or 
oftener, it will wear much longer and look better. 

19. The kitchen should have a smooth wall, either painted 
or papered with oilcloth paper, either of which can be easily 
washed ; or else the wall should be freshly calcimined twice 
a year. 

Coating the painted wall with a thin boiled starch solu- 
tion has been recommended as highly effective in removing 
the dirt and grease easily, without injury to the paint. 

20. White oilcloth pasted on the wall over the stove and 
sink will be a great protection, and very easy to keep clean. 
Pasting oil cloth on tables, shelves, etc., will be as effective 
as enameling. A good grade, like "Sanitas," should be 
used. 

21. Cooking utensils should be of the best quality and suf- 
ficient in number. Use drip pans with rounded corners of 
aluminum or high grade enamel. The ordinary tin or sheet 
iron pans made from a folded sheet are almost impossible 
to clean perfectly and at best require much extra time in 
washing. If cooking utensils are properly selected, they 
should be easily cleaned. Do not waste time cleaning old 
rough tin, or chipped enamelware. Buy muffin pans and 
other baking dishes which in combination fit the oven, so 
that it may be used to the best advantage.

GERMAN PUFFS SABYON SAUCE 

Crown of Pork 

Obtain pieces containing 6 ribs from each side of a rack 
of pork, having two pieces of the same length and height; 
have the backbone removed and cut between the ribs ; trim 
each rib above the eye as for French lamb chops ; turn the 
rib bones outside and the eyes of the chops inside and sew 
the pieces together into a circle. 

Mix I c sausage meat with i c stale bread crumbs, soft- 
ened in cold water and wrung dry; add i egg, beaten 
slightly. Put the crown in a baking-pan, with the sausage 
mixture in the open space inside the crown, cover the bones 
with buttered paper to keep from burning, dredge with salt, 
pepper and flour, and bake in a slow oven between 2 and 3 
h, basting every 10 m with the drippings, to which ^ to ^ 
c hot water is added. 

Saute to a delicate brown, in 2 T butter, 2 c small peeled 
spring onions ; add 3 c stock or hot water, and cook until 
tender, about i h. Let the liquid boil away at the last. 

Carefully remove the crown to a serving dish, place the 
onions in the center above the sausage filling, and serve at 
once. 

If the onions cannot be obtained, use the mashed potatoes 
in place of them. 

Mashed Potatoes 

Four medium sized potatoes, ij^ T butter, }i t salt, J^ c 
milk. 
Egg and Cress Salad 

Cut the whites of 4 hard cooked eggs into eighths length- 
wise, and arrange them on a bed of cress to simulate the 
petals of a flower. Place a bit of Mayonnaise in the center 
of the petals. Press the yolks through a sieve and arrange 
over the salad. Serve very cold.

beaten whites of 2 eggs. Pour into hot buttered muffin 
pans and bake about 20 m. Serve with Sabyon Sauce. 

Sabyon Sauce 

In the upper part of a double boiler beat 2 eggs well, add 
3^ c sugar, and beat thoroughly. Set over hot water and 
beat while J4 c grape juice is gradually stirred in. When 
the sauce has thickened slightly, add i t lemon juice, and 
remove at once from the fire. Be careful that the water in 
the lower part of the double boiler does not boil, otherwise 
it will be difficult to keep the egg from curdling. 

Preparing the Meal 

Three h before dinner, prepare the crown of pork and 
place in the oven. Then cook 4 eggs for the salad. Wash 
and pare both the potatoes and onions and place in cold 
water until time to cook.

WHITE AND SUNSHINE CAKE WHITE AND YELLOW CANDY EGGS 

Color Scheme — Yellow and White. 

Table Decoration 

Daffodills or jonquils may be used for the flowers. A 
pretty effect is secured by having yellow crepe paper under 
a lace or Mexican table cover or doilies. Tiny chickens can 
be used effectively either as a center piece or for favors. 
One can be put at each place holding in its nib a dainty place 
card in the shape of an egg painted on yellow and white. 
Mint Cocktail 

Cut I can pineapple into small cubes. Remove the pulp 
of 3 oranges from the dividing membrane and cut into 
small pieces. Break J^ pound after dinner mints into tiny 
pieces and mix with the fruit an hour before lunch, setting 
away in a cold place; serve in sherbet glasses, covered with 
crushed ice and powdered sugar. 
Chicken Croquettes 

To ij^ c thick white sauce (6 T flour, 4 T butter, ij4 c 
liquid), add 3 c chopped cold cooked chicken, ^ t salt, ^ t 
celery salt, speck cayenne pepper, 2 t lemon juice, and if 
desired a few drops onion juice. Mix well, set in the re- 
frigerator until very cold, then mould with the aid of a 
chicken croquette mould into tiny chickens. Egg and crumb 
and fry in hot fat. 
Mushroom Sauce 

Make 2 c medium white sauce (4 T flour, 4 T butter, 2

add two cans of the button mushrooms. Season well and 
just before serving add i T minced parsley, if desired. 
Finger Rolls 

Mix and sift twice i qt. flour, 2 T sugar, i t salt, and 3 T 
baking-powder. Cut in J4 c shortening, lard, snowdrift, 



APRIL MENUS 277 

etc.; mix to a soft dough using about 1J/2 c equal parts 
milk and water, toss onto a floured board. With the back 
of the spoon pat it out to about one inch in thickness, tak- 
ing care that there is no flour on the top of the dough. 
Soften 4 T butter, cut into small pieces, spread on the top 
and press into the dough. Fold one half over the other 
and pat out to about j/i inch in thickness. Cut into strips 
3 inches long and yi inch wide, ^nd bake in a hot oven. 

Bird's-nest Salad 

Color Neufchatel or Cottage Cheese a delicate green 
with green coloring paste. Mould into the shape and size 
of robins' eggs and lay in a nest of shredded lettuce, three 
to a serving. Sprinkle with coarse black pepper, and serve 
with French dressing. 

Angel Parfait 

Boil together i c sugar, and J^ c water until it threads. 
Beat the whites of 3 eggs until stiff and dry, adding J^ t 
cream of tartar when the eggs are foamy. Pour the syrup 
slowly onto the whites of the eggs and continue beating until 
cold. Add I T vanilla, and i pt. heavy cream, whipped 
stiff. Put into moulds and let stand for 3 h, packed in equal 
portions salt and chopped ice. 

For this Easter Luncheon color half of the Parfait with 
either the yolk of an egg or with the yellow coloring matter. 
Put into the moulds in layers or with a marbled effect. 

A very attractive way of serving the .dessert for this 
luncheon would be as follows: Make Vanilla Wafers, roll 
as cornucopias, fill with the Angel Parfait and lay on a 
dessert plate with a daffodil beside it. 

Rolled Vanilla Wafers 

Cream J4 c butter, add gradually yi c powdered sugar, 
and cream in J^ c milk, adding it a few drops at a time. 
The mixture should be smooth and creamy. If it seems to 
curdle, too much milk has been added at a time. By beating 
well it will become smooth again. Then add Ji c bread flour 
and ^2 t vanilla. Spread the mixture very thinly on an 
inverted buttered dripping pan, smoothing it with a broad 
bladed knife or spatula. Mark in 3 inch squares and bake 
in a slow oven until delicately browned. When done draw 



278 LESSONS IN COOKING 

the pan to the front of the oven, and with a sharp pointed 
knife run along the crease, separating each wafer. With 
the point of the knife raise the edge of each wafer and roll 
either in cornucopias, or cylinders, cornerwise or straight 
across. This must be done while the wafers are very hot, 
otherwise they will be too brittle. If they become brittle 
while handling put back in the oven and reheat. Have the • 
plate and knife ready at hand so that not a moment will 
be lost after the process of rolling has begun. It may seem 
a little difficult at first to handle the wafers while they are 
so hot, but a little practice will make it very easy. 

Sunshine Cake 

Beat the whites of lo eggs until stiff and dry, add i)4 c 
powdered sugar gradually, and continue beating; then add 
the yolks of 6 eggs beaten until thick and lemon colored, and 
I t lemon extract. Cut, and fold in i c flour mixed and 
sifted with i t cream of tartar. Bake 50 m in a moderate 
oven in an angel-cake pan. 

White Cake 

One half c butter, lyi c sugar, % c water, 3 c flour, 6 t 
baking-powder, whites 6 eggs, 2 t vanilla. See p. 33, "Cake 
for Sunday Evening." 

Preparing the Luncheon 

The day before the luncheon cook the chicken and make 
the cakes. The chicken can be taken from the skin and 
bones and the croquette mixture prepared the night before 
or early enough in the morning so that it will be ice cold 
before moulding. 

Four h before serving make the Angel Parfait and pack 
in salt and ice. Mould the croquettes and return to the ice 
box. Prepare the lettuce and lay on the ice ; color the 
cheese, mould into eggs, and put in a cool place. Arrange the 
table, and set out the dishes. Make the Mmt Cocktail and 
set on the ice. Put the fat for frying the croquettes on to 
heat, then make the Butter Rolls and set in a cool place. 

Make the Mushroom Sauce and keep hot until needed; 
while the Butter Rolls are baking fry the croquettes, and 
set in the warming oven. Cut the cake, put the salad on 
the plates and make the French Dressing. Then make the 



APRIL MENUS 279 

cofifee and fill the water glasses. Put the cocktail in the 
sherbet glasses, adding the sugar and shaved ice just be- 
fore serving. Serve at once. 

In serving the luncheon have the plates where they will 
be kept warm. Lay the chicken croquette on the plate with 
a spoonful of mushroom sauce, and one or two butter rolls. 
Have the rest of the butter rolls passed. 

Arrange the wafers, on two plates preparatory to passing 
with the salad. 

Have the dessert plates for the Parfait in a cold place. 

The yellow and white candies can be made of fondant 
if desired, and either molded in the forms of eggs or melted

HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS 
Preparing Oranges 

To remove the pulp of the orange from the dividing seg- 
ment proceed as follows. With a paring knife cut the out- 
side skin off, being careful to take with it the fine membrane 
covering the pulp. Insert the knife between the pulp and 
the dividing segment of one section. Work carefully along 
separating pulp from the skin, then slip the knife up on the 
other side, removing the entire section of pulp. Proceed in 
this way with each one. While working hold the orange 
over a bowl to catch the juice. 

Oranges prepared in this way are much nicer for salads, 
desserts, etc., than when the tough membrane is left on 
them. 

Immersing oranges in hot water for a few minutes be- 
fore peeling will make the skin come off very easily re- 
moving all of the white skin with it. 

Shaping Croquettes 

Croquette mixtures should be very soft and creamy, but 
in this condition are very hard to handle unless they are 
ice cold. In moulding drop a spoonful of the cold mixture 
first into the breadcrumbs, then press into the mould, mak- 
ing it the desired shape. Unmould and proceed as directed 
on p. 104. 

Moulds of many shapes can be bought, the cone being 
the best for ordinary purposes, but chickens, rabbits, etc., 
are very nice for special occasions. 

Canned Mushrooms 

In using canned mushrooms drain the liquor from them 
and rinse in cold water. This should be done with all canned 
vegetables such as peas, string beans, etc., that are in a 
liquid. The flavor is more delicate, that brackishness which 
is often noticeable being taken away. 

Shredded Lettuce 

To shred lettuce wash and dry well, lay several leaves to- 
gether. If they are very broad split in two places. Roll up 
tightly and with a sharp knife cut across, making fine shreds. '_ 
Toss lightly until they unroll and separate. This method 



APBIL MENUS 281 

of preparation makes lettuce a very dainty garnish. Parsley 
can be shredded or minced in the same way. 

The leaves are split so that the shreds will not be too long 
and it will be easier to eat .them. 
Sealing Moulds 

In packing moulds in ice and salt, they should be 
thoroughly sealed with a piece of soft, pliable paper dipped 
in melted fat. Lay it along the crack, pressing closely so 
that it will fit absolutely tight.

SUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING THE COST OF 
THE APRIL MENUS 

Use butter substitutes in cooking. Use top of milk in 
place of cream for cereal and coffee. If expensive reduce 
the quantity of milk or use skimmed milk in cooking. 

In L. 153 omit the scrambled eggs and chopped meat; 
also the almond steak in L. 154, substituting lettuce. In 
L. 155 omit the sweet potatoes, and substitute cherry cubes 
for Jerusalem pudding for dessert. Cherry cubes may 
be made from Cherry Jello or Bromangelan, or by flavor- 
ing plain gelatine with cherry and, when set, cut into }i inch 
cubes for serving. 

In L. 156 use dry toast instead of hot cornbread or plain 
rice for puffed rice, and in L. 157 omit the sauted brains. 
In L. 158 serve old potatoes riced, instead of new potatoes 
in cream, and use rhubarb sauce in place of pie for des- 
sert. In L. 159 omit the doughnuts, and in L. 161 the peas. 
In L. 162 omit the cereal and baked apples. 

In L. 164 substitute Hamburg roast for baked loin of 
mutton. In L. 165 omit the cereal and use leftover beef 
for beef ramikins, also use dry toast in place of coffee cake. 
In L. 167 omit the timbale cases. In L. 168 omit the 
prunes and the tomato toast and use dry toast instead of 
cream muffins. In L. 170 use raisin bread pudding instead 
of bakewell pudding. 

In L. 171 have dry toast instead of the hot cross buns.

PART IX 

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 

Food should never be kept in paper sacks or packages, 
but when received should be put away in tightly closed jars, 
well labeled. Packages that may be opened without dam- 
age so that they may be closed, such as crackers, etc., may 
be left in the package, but care should be taken each time 
to fold the oiled paper and close the box properly. 

Dried fruits should be scalded to kill any germs, washed 
thoroughly, dried, and put away clean. 

Nuts, if bought shelled, should be scalded, dried and put 
away in glass jars, ready for use. 

Vegetables of the tuber class should be kept in a dark 
place. 

Green vegetables should either be put into water, or else 
washed, laid in cloths or folds of paper, and kept on ice 
or in a cool place. 

Bread should never be wrapped in cloths, but kept in tin 
boxes or stone jars, which should be scalded out every 
week, aired ahd dried thoroughly. 

Cake, doughnuts, cookies, etc., should also be kept in tin 
boxes or stone jars. 

Meat, when received from the butcher, should be removed 
from the paper immediately, put on a plate and set near 
the ice or in a cool place. Before using it should be wiped 
with a damp cloth. 

Eggs, when received, should be washed and kept in a 
cool place. If desired very cold, and no ice is on hand, let 
stand in cold water. 

Butter should be kept in a covered jar in a cool place. 
If set in the refrigerator, it, with the milk, should be placed 
on the bottom shelf, so that any odors that might arise 
from other foods will be less likely to permeate them. _ 

Milk, when received, unless in bottles, should be put into 
well scalded, cooled pans. If in bottles, wash carefully, 
especially the mouth and top, and let the milk stand in them 
until ready for use. 

285 



286 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Care and Use of the Refrigerator 

The refrigerator siiould be washed once a week when 
the ice is low or out. The drains should be carefully 
cleaned out, using for this purpose a round stick with swab 
attached, or a brush with the bristles coming out from the 
center, made especially for this purpose. The little cup 
under the drain should receive special attention. If the 
refrigerator is attached to a main drain, the pipes leading 
to it should occasionally be cleaned and flushed. A piece 
of charcoal laid in the refrigerator will absorb odors and 
impurities, and will aid greatly in keeping it sweet and 
pure. 

What to do Without Ice 

This is a problem confronting many housekeepers. If 
there is a cellar, of course that is the solution. A "dumb 
waiter" running from the kitchen or pantry to the cold room 
of the cellar will save many steps. 

A window box, of which there are many kinds on the 
market now, the metal ones being the best, or a home-made 
one fitted up and set in the window, will keep food very well 
during cool weather. In warm weather its efficacy can be 
increased by keeping heavy cloths, such as burlap or gunny 
sacks, kept wet in cold water, laid over it. This principle 
of creating cold by evaporation can be applied in many 
ways. 

A miner's box carrying out this principle can be used in 
' the home, out camping, and in any emergency. Take the 
frame of a box, the ends, top and bottom on, with the two 
sides open, and fit it up with shelves. Good dimensions for 
this would be 2 ft high, 3 ft long and i ft deep. Cover the 
back of the box with three thicknesses of muslin and two 
layers of burlap, old blanket or other heavy material. 
Make the front of the box of the same material, but so 
arranged that it may be raised or opened as a door. Make 
as nearly dustproof as possible. Keep the front and back 
wet constantly and the box standing where a breeze will 
strike it. 

A good way to keep the cloth wet is to have a large bowl 
of water standing on top of the box with strips of cloth 
running from it to the sides. The water in the bowl will 
have to be replenished frequently. 



MAY MENUS 287 

The degree of cold obtained will depend greatly upon 
the condition of the atmosphere. When this is very dry, 
the evaporation will be much more rapid, and the cold cor- 
respondingly increased. 

Care of Leftovers 

The greatest attention should be given to the care of the 
leftovers so that they will be in the proper condition to use. 
Foods should never be put away in the dishes in which they 
have been served, because of the inconvenience, the unat- 
tractiveness in appearance, and the inadvisability of setting 
good dishes in the refrigerator. A small jar should be kept 
especially for meats. When the- meat is brought from the 
table it should be freed from the bones and fat and put into, 
the jar. If the bones are to be used for soup, put them at 
one side of the jar. Gravies and the scrapings of the plat- 
ter should be kept in a small bowl. 

Vegetables should receive the care that their character 
demands. Green vegetables, as stated above should, be 
wrapped in a cloth or paper and put in a cool place. When 
cooked vegetables are left, plan the use, and put away 
accordingly. Two or three may be put away together if they 
are to be combined in a made-over dish, as in soups, cro- 
quettes, etc. 

Jelly glasses are very convenient for this purpose, occupy- 
ing small space and being easily covered. 

Pieces of bread that are left, crusts, etc., should be put 
in a pan and set in a warm, dry place where they will dry 
out slowly and be ready to use as bread crumbs or dry 
bread. They should never be thrown back into the bread 
box with the other bread. Cake , and cookies should be 
taken care of in the same way dry cake crumbs, being very 
useful in making desserts. 

Small amounts of preserves, jellies, canned fruits, etc., if 
put away in jelly glasses and kept covered so they will not 
dry out, can also be used to advantage in desserts and 
entrees. 

Keeping Supplies on Hand 

The systematic, thoughtful housekeeper will always have 
on hand reserve supplies to meet whatever emergency may 
arise. In selecting these supplies, thought should be given 



28is LESSONS IN COOKING 

to the use to which they may be put. Canned soups, and 
vegetables that can be utilized in creami soups, should be 
on hand. Canned vegetables are always easy to choose, but 
it requires a little thought to get materials that could be 
used for salads. For this, asparagus, string beans, kidney 
beans, peas, with the addition of nuts, can be utilized very 
nicely. In fruits, canned peaches, pears, pineapple, white 
cherries and grapes, either in combination or with oranges, 
bananas, nuts, etc., will make dainty salads. 

The "bouillon cubes" now on the market are excellent 
and very convenient. A can or two of unsweetened con- 
densed milk may help out in an emergency. There now 
may be obtained a number of canned dehydrated fruits and 
vegetables — even dehydrated cream soup — which take up 
little space in the store closet. These are especially useful 
when camping. The dried fruits — apricots, peaches, prunes, 
apples and pears, are much less expensive than canned fruits 
and may be kept on hand in covered receptacles. They can- 
not be prepared quickly, however. 

Canned fish, such as salmon, kippered herring, etc., and 
the canned meats, tongue, chicken, corned beef, etc., will 
help greatly in an emergency, being served either cold or 
hot, in a natural state, or with some sauce, or made into 
scalloped dishes, croquettes, souffles, etc. Smoked fish and 
meats may be kept on hand in small quantities. 

For desserts, the following suggestions may be helpful: 
Boxes of candied pineapple, cherries, and other fruits, with 
dates, figs and nuts, will always furnish the foundation for a 
quick, dainty dessert. For example, into the bottom of a 
pudding dish put some toasted breakfast food, such as 
puffed wheat, or bread, or cake crumbs, sprinkle over with 
small pieces of dates and a few nuts. Another layer of 
breakfast food, with some more dates and nuts on top; 
over this pour a little soft custard or cream. A few pieces 
of candied pineapple or cherries on top will make it more 
attractive. 

Canned plum pudding, different kinds of fancy wafers, 
and preserved fruits will always be ready.

Method of Work 

The first thing in the morning set the sponge for the 
cinnamon rolls. Immediately after breakfast make the 
brown bread and set to steaming. When this is done the 
sponge will have risen and the dough may be made, 
kneaded and set to rise again. Make the macaroons next, 
and while baking slowly, make the cake. While the cake 
is baking the cinnamon rolls may be finished; shaped and 
set to rise again for the last time. Make the frosting for 
the cake and when the cake is cool spread with the frost- 
ing. This frosting will not be injured by standing a while. 
By the time the cake is baked the rolls will be ready for 
the oven. Bake about 20 m ur yi h. While the cinnamon 
rolls are baking, place the brown bread in the oven for 
the last half hour to dry off and brown.

Pick over and wash i qt. of strawberries. Mash slightly 
adding i c sugar. Cover the lower layer of the shortcake 
with the strawberries, replace the top layer, cover with 
berries and serve, with or without cream as desired. 
Preparing the Meal 

About I h before dinner time put the onions on to cook 
in boiling salted water. Since they are to be mashed, and 
it is not desired to have a very strong ilavor, they may be 
cut into small pieces for cooking, thus lessening the time 
for cooking by about half. Wash, pare and cook 4 medium 
sized potatoes. Now make the shortcake and place in the 
oven. Wash and chop the lettuce, pick over, wash and 
mash the strawberries with the sugar. Cut the bacon into 
small cubes for broiling. Make the White Sauce for the 
souffle. 

Now drain and mash the onions, finish the souffle and

Table Decoration 

Let the decorations be, if possible, in wild flowers. Dog- 
wood, May flowers, trillia, hepatica, trailing arbutus, violets, 
anemones, etc., are all in bloom at this time of the year in 
dift'erent parts of the country. Let the arrangement be 
careless and graceful, with delicate vines, if they can be 
secured, running from the center and outlining the plates. 

Strawberries au Naturel 

Select very large, perfect berries, wash and drain, leav- 
ing the hulls on. Place in the center of the plate a small 
cup containing powdered sugar. This cup may be one of 
the dainty paper models, or if possible for this special occa- 
sion, made of green leaves folded and pinned in shape. 
Around the cup lay a circle of the strawberries, with the 
hulls toward the edge of the plate. If they can be secured, 
large leaves may be laid on the plates instead of paper 
doilies. The strawberries are taken up by the hulls, dipped 
in the sugar, and eaten. 

Lamb Chops 

Select rib chops and have the butcher French them; 
wipe with a damp cloth and broil either in a broiler or on 
top the stove in a frying-pan. Remove to a hot platter, 
dust with salt and pepper, and spread with butter. If 
desired, the fancy paper frills may be slipped over the bone 
ends, or a sprig of parsley may be twisted around it.

Preparing the Breakfast 

Cook the cornmeal for the waffles, and while cooking look 
over the berries, wash and arrange on a plate with the 
_ hulls toward the edge, around the little cup of powdered 
sugar in the center. Prepare the potato puff mixture, hav- 
ing the fat for frying heating while doing so; then wipe 
the chops and pan broil. When browned on both sides, 
lower the flames, and cook slowly for 5-7 m. During this ,

MAY MENUS 313 

DIET FOR THE SICK 

Diet for the sick and convalescent is usually divided into 
four classes — namely, liquid, soft, light, and general. 

Liquid diet includes milk, broth, cream soup, eggnog, 
plain gelatine, ice cream, ices, fruit juices, etc. 

Soft diet, in addition to the liquid, is composed of gruels, 
well cooked cereals, such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, farina, 
etc., milk and cream toast, soft cooked eggs, custards, etc. 

Light diet contains no meat except breast of chicken, 
sweetbreads, brains, fish, oysters ; and for vegetables, baked, 
mashed and creamed potatoes, spinach, lettuce, vegetable 
souffles containing the pulp but not the fibrous parts of 
vegetables, fruits, and most light desserts. Of course, rich 
pastry and puddings are excluded absolutely. 

The general diet is about the same as the light, except 
that the more easily digested meats are included. Never 
give pork to a patient. Fried meats also are to be avoided. 

While ordinarily the diet of a patient in charge of a phy- 
sician will be ordered by the latter, nevertheless the house- 
mother should have some idea of what is proper to give. 
First of all, keep this fact in mind: that a person sick in 
bed needs little food, and that in most cases if the stomach 
is given a rest convalescence soon follows. Also remember 
that during illness all the organs are necessarily weakened 
to a certain extent so that very easily digested food should 
be given, thus requiring the minimum amount of work for 
assimilation. 

Serving — ^the Tray 

Have the tray covered with a snowy napkin and every- 
thing about it as dainty, clean and attractive as possible, 
remembering always that with a patient appearance counts 
for a great deal. Whenever one can, without harm to the 
invalid, give such foods as he likes and wants. Serve in 
small quantities, in an attractive way and with a harmoniz- 
ing color scheme. For instance, one might have a light . 
diet tray consisting of chicken broth, a small piece of breast 
of chicken, mashed potato, cranberry jelly, bread and butter 
and baked custard. Pour the soup into a hot soup bowl and 
set in the center of the front of the tray, with the knife and 
two spoons on the right and the fork on the left. Have 



314 LESSONS IN COOKING 

the soup Spoon the first of the spoons, beginning- at the 
right. Over the soup bowl set the hot plate containing 
the chicken garnished with a sprig of parsley, a small mound 
of creamy mashed potato, and two or three cones of cran- 
berry jelly laid on a lettuce leaf. The cones may be made 
by cutting the jelly with a wet teaspoon inserted point down- 
ward and turned in the hand. The dark green of the pars- 
ley and red of the jelly contrast very prettily and make an 
attractive looking plate. 

At the right of the plate set a cup o£ tea or cocoa, or 
coffee, if allowed. At the left place the bread and butter 
plate with two small sandwiches made of very thin slices of 
bread from which the crusts have been removed, spread 
with butter and cut in diamond, circular or triangular 
shapes. Above the bread plate set the sauce dish with the 
mould of baked custard, above the soup' bowl the small 
sugar bowl, creamer, and salt shaker — do not give pepper 
because of its irritating effects — and above the cup of tea 
set a glass of water. If the patient will drink milk, so much 
the better. Place the fresh napkin wherever there is a 
. space for it. Cover the entire tray with a clean cloth and 
serve at once. When the appetite is poor, small portions 
are very much more tempting than large ones, which have 
a discouraging effect. 

Remove all traced of the meal as soon as the patient has 
finished, thus giving no opportunity for him to grow weary 
of looking at the food. Also keep him in ignorance of what 
he is to be given, thus letting the anticipation and surprise 
be a stimulant to his appetite. And, most important of all, 
be cheerful at all tim.es and keep your patient so, especially 
at meal times.

SUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING THE COST OF, 
THE MAY MENUS 

Unless butter is low in price, use substitutes in cooking. 
Use top of milk instead of cream for cofTee and cereal — 
cream is always a luxury, except in certain favored localities. 

In L. 175, omit the broiled beef patties. In L. 177, serve 
plain sliced cucumbers instead of a la Poulette, and omit the 
apple salad. In L. 178, omit the cereal, cream and sugar, 
and in L. 179, the cheese balls. In L. 180, omit the peas, 
and in L. 181, the coddled apples. In L. 183, omit the 
sponge cake, and in L. 184, the egg timbales. In L. 186, 
omit the pickled beets and substitute canned peaches for the 
peach canapes. In L. 187, omit the canned plums, and in 
L. 188, use plain bread and butter instead of the Potato 
Biscuits. In L. 189, substitute 2 lbs. boiled salmon for the 
shad, and omit the Brussels sprouts. In L. 192, omit both 
the soufHe and wilted lettuce, but serve the shortcake with 
cream. In L. 193, omit the cheese omelet, and in L. 194, 
the tomatoes with cream sauce. In L. 195, omit the boiled 
ham, and serve iced tea instead of cocoa.

FRUIT PRESERVATION 

The prevention of decay or preservation is accomplished 
,by sterilization — this is brought about in two ways — 

I — By killing all bacteria, molds and other organisms by 
means oi heat and enclosing in tight jars. 

2 — By the use of a medium, such as a strong sugar or 
acid solution, in which bacteria will not live. 
Utensils 

The following list of utensils will be necessary for con- 
venient and effective work. Sauce pans, bowls, spoons, 
colander, fruit press, dipper and funnel of porcelain, 
enamel or aluminum should be provided as tin or iron 
should never be used with fruit; jelly bags made of loosely 
woven flannel or double cheese cloth, glass measuring cup 
and a scale, jelly glasses, fruit jars with new rubbers. 

Have the jelly bag sewed to a ring (a wooden embroidery 
ring will do) and if convenience is desired a handle could 
be fastened to the ring, thus making it possible for one 
person to easily and quickly fill a jelly bag without fear of 
burning. An arm from which to suspend the jelly bag for 
draining should be in a convenient place above the table or 
sink. A bird cage hook which can be laid against the wall 
when not in use is good for this purpose. 

The best style of preserve jars have a glass cover and 
close with a spring, but the improved Mason jars with glass 
cover are satisfactory. Pints are better than quarts for a 
small family. 
Time and Manner of Preserving 

The manner of preserving depend greatly on the con- 
dition of the fruit. Consequently the fruit should be se- 
lected according to the process one wishes to employ or the 
process should be decided upon according to the condition 
of the fruit. For instance if one wishes to make jelly select 
green or slightly underripe fruit, but if the fruit on hand 
is overripe it can be made into jam or marmalade.

Sterilizing Jars 

Fruit jars and jelly glasses should be thoroughly cleansed 
and sterilized before using. To sterilize put into a pan of 
cold water and bring slowly to the boiling point and boil at 
least 5 minutes. Let stand in the boiling water until ready 





PEESERVB JARS 



"LIGHTNING" 



IMPROVED "MASON" 



to fill. Sterilize the covers of the jars by dropping into the 
boiling water just before using. 

CANNING FRUIT 

There are two processes of canning, one by cooking the 
fruit and then putting it into the cans, the other by cooking 
it in the cans. 

The general proportions to use for canning are i part 
sugar, 2 parts water, to 4 parts fruit. 

Select fruit when it is at its best — ripe but not overripe, 
firm and free from blemishes and bruises. 

Preparation of the Fruit 

Small fruits should be washed thoroughly before being 
freed from the hulls, because then there is no open surface 
from which the juice can be extracted. Then remove from 
the stem, or hulls, and drain. Large fruits should be washed, 
pared, left whole or cut in halves as desired and the stones 



JUNE MENUS 319 

or cores removed, any bruised or decayed portions should 
be cut out. Peaches and plums should be scalded to remove 
the skins easily. Use a silver plated knife in paring as a 
steel knife will stain fruits. If the fruit is one that will 
discolor easily when exposed to the air and cannot be used 
immediately put into an enamelled vessel, surround with 
waxed paper, cover closely thus completely excluding air. 

Process I 

Weigh the fruit, then proportion the sugar and water by 
weight accordingly, i part sugar, and i part water to 4 
parts small fruit — strawberries, grapes, etc. or i part sugar, 
2 parts water to 4 parts large fruit — pears, peaches, etc. 
Make a syrup of the sugar and water, boil 5 minutes and 
skim if necessary. Cook a small quantity of the fruit at a 
time in the syrUp until tender and transfer to the sterilized 
jar. Fill the jar to overflowing with the syrup and screw 
on the cover, always using new rubbers. 

Since the syrup used in canning is not a sufficiently strong 
solution to prevent the growth of bacteria, every precaution 
must be taken to insure perfect sterilization and to keep air 
tight. 

Process II 

Prepare the fruit, weigh and make syrup as in Process I. 
Place fruit in the sterilized jars as fast as prepared, set them 
on a wooden rack or several folds of paper or cloth in a 
sauce pan, boiler or steamer, half filled with warm water. 
Fill each jar with the syrup to overflowing. Adjust new 
rubbers and screw the covers down lightly. Bring water to 
the boiling point and let boil from 15 to 30 ininutes accord- 
ing to the size of the fruit. If necessary add more hot 
syrup or boiling water to fill the jars again to overflowing. 
Screw the covers on tight, and let stand in the water to cool. 
Tighten the covers again, invert the jars and let stand for a 
few hours to see that no juice is forced out under the cover, 
thus showing that it is air tight. Keep in a cook dark place. 

PRESERVED FRUITS 

For preserving, the syrup is made much stronger, and 
fruit that is less perfect as well as riper can be used. Pre- 
pare the fruit as in canning. 



320 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Proportions 

The general proportion for preserving are i part fruit -O 
% to I part sugar and ^ to ^ part water by weight. In 
the small fruits use from J^ to ^ parts water according 
to the juiciness. The larger fruits require more water, 
usually J^ part. 

The same methods are used for preserving as for canning, 
with the additional one of "sun preserves." 

With Processes I or II make the strong syrup and pro- 
ceed as in canned fruits. Hard fruits such as quince and 
winter pears should be cooked in water first until almost 
tender. Then that water used to make the syrup, and the 
fruit finished off in the syrup. Otherwise the syrup darkens, 
gets heavy and strong flavored before the fruit is cooked. 

Preserves are always put up in small jars or glasses for 
they are so rich that small quantities only are used at a time. 
Cook only a small portion of the fruit at a time in the syrup 
thus preserving the shape as perfectly as possible. 
Sunshine Preserves 

For this method the fruit is washed and brought to the 
boiling point, then an equal quantity by weight of sugar is 
added, and the whole simmered without stirring from 5 to 
10 m. It ,is then spread on large platters, covered with 
glass and set in the hot sunshine for about 2 days, that is 
letting it have the sunshine for about 24 h all together. At 
the end, of that time it is put into sterilized jars without re- 
heating. By this method of preservation the fruit keeps its 
shape and retains its original flavor very much better. 

,The best fruits for this are strawberries, cherries, white 
and red currants, ripe gooseberries, red and black rasp- 
berries, and blackberries. Pineapple and pears cut into half 
inch cubes may also be used, either alone or combined with 
any small fruits. Pineapple and strawberries are an espe- 
cially pleasing combination, as well as pears and cherries. 

Honey may be substituted for sugar in Sunshine Pre- 
serves, using it in the proportion of i part fruit to % part 
strained honey, instead of equal parts of each as with sugar. 

JELLIES 

In making jelly the pure juice of the fruit is extracted 
then cooked with sugar till it reaches the jelly stage. 



JUiY^ ME^WS 3-21 

Underripe fruit is the best to select for jelly. In some 
cases green fruit, such as green grapes, may be used. 
Pectin 

The element in fruit juice that causes it to jelly is called 
pectin, but to make a perfect jelly the juice must also be 
acid. Certain fruit juices such as peach, while they contain 
pectin will not jelly because of the lack of acid. This can 
often be supplied by adding some fruit acid such as citric, 
or tartaric acids. 
Proportions 

The amount of sugar varies somewhat with the acidity 
of the fruit, but in general the proportions are three-fourths 
to one part sugar, to one part fruit juice. 

Fruit juice can be made to jelly without the addition of 
any sugar, but it requires long boiling, will be dark in color 
and unpalatable. An over proportion of sugar however will 
keep it from jellying, making it syrupy or may result in the 
formation of crystals. 
Time of Boiling 

The time of boiling depends on the concentration of the 
fruit juice, the proportion of sugar, and pectin, and in all 
probability the degree of acidity. 

If the fruit juice is very dilute it should be boiled before 
the sugar is added, to concentrate it, so that the cooking 
after the sugar is added will not be too long. But the con- 
centration should not be so great that the boiling after the 
sugar is added is not long enough to change the form of 
sugar. Too long (an hour or more) or too short, (5 m) 
boiling may result in the formation of sugar crystals. 

JAMS, BUTTERS AND MARMALADES 

Jams, butters and marmalades are made from using the 
entire pulp of the fruit and either some or all of the juice. 
Very often after the first juice is drained off for jelly mak- 
ing, the pulp that is left is made up into jams, butters or 
marmalade. 
Proportions 

% to I part sugar to i part fruit. 
Process 

The process of making jam, butters or marmalade may 
differ slightly for different fruits but in general the pulp is 



322 LESSONS IN COOKING 

pressed through a sieve coarse enough to retain seeds, etc. 
Then this expressed piilp is cooked down, the sugar being 
added a little at a time and spices when desired, added 
toward the end of the process. The cooking is continued 
until the desired consistency is reached, jams and butter 
being thick enough to drop from the spoon, marmalades 
thinner. All can be packed in small jars or large crocks. , 

SPECIAL RECIPES 

The foregoing directions are complete and applicable to 
all general work in the preservation of fruits. Take for 
instance canned peaches — according to directions given the 
process would be as follows : 

Canned Peaches 

Sterilize jars and utensils. Weigh the fruit and make a 
syrup, using ^ the weight of the peaches in sugar and J^, 
the weight in water. (A pint of either sugar or water 
weighs about a pound.) When the syrup comes to a boil, 
skim it if necessary and remove the kettle to a place where 
the syrup will keep hot but not boil. 

Scald a part of the peaches, remove the skins, cut in half 
and remove some of the stones, leaving a few to improve 
the flavor, add the prepared peaches to the syrup and bring 
to a boil, skim carefully and boil gently for about ten min- 
utes or until the fruit is tender and can be pierced easily 
with a silver fork; then place in sterihzed jars. 

While the first lot of peaches is cooking, prepare the sec- 
ond lot and add to the kettle as soon as the first lot is re- 
moved, cooking as before. The size of the preserving ket- 
tle determines the number of peaches to be cooked at one 
time. They should not be more than one layer deep. 

When all the peaches are cooked and in the jars, fill the 
jars with syrup and screw the covers on tight. If there is 
not sufficient syrup to completely fill the jars, a little more 
should be made, and if there is syrup left over, it may be 
placed in a preserve jar and used for sauces. If the peaches 
are not very tart a little lemon juice added to the syrup will 
improve the flavor greatly. 

When no scales are at hand the weight of fruit may be 
estimated at about i% lbs. to the quart. 



JVNE MENUS 323 

_ The following are a few special recipes where combina- 
tions are made and different flavorings used. 

Canned Quince and Apples 

Wash, pare, quarter, and core an equal number of apples 
and quinces. Cook the quince in clear water for 25 m at 
simmering temperature, then use this water to make the 
syrup in which cook the apple and quince together, follow- 
ing the direction as given. 

Canned Pineapple 

Cut pineapple into half-inch slices, pare and remove eyes 
from each slice and then cut the slices into cubes, discarding 
the core. Follow direction for canning. 

If preferred they may be shredded or ground. 

Strawberry and Cherry Preserves 

Prepare fruit, use in equal portions or one-third cherry to 
two-thirds strawberry, and follow directions for sunshine 
preserves. 

Gingered Pears 

Cut }i pound of ginger root as small as possible, cover 
with water and let simmer for about i h, or longer if neces- 
sary to make a strong decoction. Strain, add enough water 
to make 2 c. Slice 4 lemons very thin, carefully discarding 
all seeds and cook in the ginger water until the skin is ten- 
der. Then add 4j4 pounds sugar, and cook 5 m. Add 6 
pounds of pears, cored, pared and cut into 8ths lengthwise. 
Follow directions for preserves. 

Rhubarb and Fig Preserves 

Cut 4 pounds rhubarb into inch pieces and i lb. figs into 
strips. Add the juice and grated rind of 2 lemons, ^ lb. 
candied orange peel and 3>4 lb. sugar. Put all into a pre- 
serving kettle and let stand over night. Cook slowly about 
I h or until fig and lemon rind are tender. Stir occasionally. 

Tomato Preserves 

Select either small red or little yellow pear tomatoes. 
Scald and peel 4 lb. tomatoes using 2 c water. Cook 4 lem- 
ons cut in thin slices discarding the seeds, in 2 c water for 
20 or 25 m or until tender. Then add 3 lb. sugar. Boil 5 m 
and skim. Then follow directions for preserving. If the 



324 LESSONS IN COOKING 

syrup is too thin after tomatoes are cooked, boil down to 
the desired consistency. 

If the tomatoes are sliced cook all together with the lem- 
ons and sugar until of the right consistency. 

Apple and Mint Jelly 

Wash and cut into small pieces 4 lbs. of Greening apples, 
and put into a granite sauce pan. Wash and chop quite fine 
enough mint to fill one cup, and add to the apples. Add 
enough water to keep from burning, and cook until the 
apples are tender and fall to pieces. Then strain, pressing 
the bag to extract the juice. Use % c sugar to each c-of 
juice. Cook until about ready to jelly, then add 4 t lemon 
juice, and enough color paste to make a delicate green, and 
pour into glasses. 

Creme de Menthe cordial may be used if the fresh mint 
cannot be obtained, adding enough to give the desired flavor. 

Combination for Jellies 

For combinations of fruits that are ripe at different times, 
such as apple and raspberry, strawberry and apple, black- 
berry and quince, currants and peaches, extract the juice of 
the fruit that is ripe first, bring to the boil, put into sterilized 
jars or bottles and seal. Then when the other fruit is ripe 
make the jelly according to directions given above for jelly 
making. 

Apple and quince in equal parts make an excellent jelly. 

Rose Geranium Jelly 

Make apple jelly, place a rose geranium leaf in the bottom 
of each gkss, and pour on the hot jelly. The geranium leaf 
will rise to the top. If one desires a delicate flavor remove 
the leaf at once. A very strong flavor, too strong to be de- 
sirable, will result if the leaf is left in the glass. 

Grape Jam 

Wash the grapes and remove from the stems, separate the 
skin from the pulp, and cook the latter until the seeds are 
freed. Then strain through a coarse sieve, pressing all 
through but the seeds. Then add to the skins, heat to the 
boiling point, and add sugar in the proportion of }i part to 
I part of fruit. Cook until it thickens slightly on a cold 
dish. 



JVNE MENUS 325 

Tomato Marmalade 

Remove the skins from 4 lbs. ripe tomatoes and slice. 
Slice 4 lemons very thin, being careful to remove all the 
seeds, and add to the tomatoes with ^ c seeded raisins. 
Bring slowly to the simmering point and then add 3 lbs. 
sugar. Let simmer until of the consistency of marmalade, 
pour into sterlized jars and seal. 

A medium time of boiling, (from 8 to 30 m) gives the 
best results. With juice extracted with the aid of little or 
no water, such as grape, currant, etc., bring it to the boiling 
point, boil about 5 m, then add the sugar heated through, 
and boil until it gives the jelly test. 

Having the sugar hot prevents the cooling dowrr of the 
fruit juice, which would make the cooking process longer. 

To heat the sugar, put it in a large dripping pan, and set 
in a warm oven, stir from time to time, heating it gradually 
without melting. 

Test for Jelly 

The quick test, and one which proves to be very accurate 
after experience, is the sheeting (that is, dropping in a 
whole transparent sheet) from the spoon. 

The cooling test should be used by the inexperienced per- 
son, or if there is any doubt. This consists in putting a 
spoonful of the jelly on a sauce dish, and cooling quickly on 
ice or otherwise to see if it jellies. In using the latter test, 
which necessarily takes a few minutes, the kettle of jelly 
should be set back so that the cooking is retarded, as those 
few minutes might carry it beyond the right point. 

In using a thermometer the best temperature to stop the 
boiling ranges from 221° to 223° F. If the jelly does not 
set quickly, place it uncovered in the sun for a few hours. 

Sealing Jellies, Jams and Marmalades 

The jelly should be poured into hot sterilized glasses, and 
when cold sealed with melted paraffine. The most convenient 
way to use paraffine is to melt it in a small coffee pot and 
pour from the spout. The coffee pot should have a tightlid. 

When the jelly is used, remove the cake of paraffine, rinse 
off and drop into the pot and use again when wanted:

For June Menus instead of a summary of the cost and food value of 
the meals for the whole week, we give approximate cost and food value 
of each separate dish and meal when served for four persons. The fol- 
lowing are the prices used in these calculations: Flour, 3^c per lb. or 
about Ic a cup; bread, 5c per lb.; sugar, 5%c per lb.; butter, 28c per 
lb. ; milk, 8c per qt. ; cream, 32e per qt. ; eggs, 20e per doz. ; coffee, 32e 
per lb. ; potatoes, 45e per peck ; rice, 8c per lb. ; spring vegetables, 10c 
per qt. 

These prices are somewhat lower than current prices in large cities and 
their suburbs, but they are higher than prices to be obtained in many 
towns and villages, and so represent about the average. The quantities 
of bread, butter, sugar, etc., taken have been determined by weighing 
amounts commonly used.

Devilled Steak 

Melt 2 T butter in a frying pan, slice one onion into it and 
saute gently until golden brown in color, then remove from 
the butter. Cut i flank steak into pieces 3 inches long, and 
2 inches wide, dredge them lightly in 2 T flour, and saute in 
the butter until well browned. Remove the meat from the 
frying pan, add i t salt, J4 t pepper, }i t paprika, i t mus-

the pieces of meat. Mix all together and add 2 c boiling 
water. Replace the steak in the pan, cover closely, and sim- 
mer gently i h or until the steak is tender. Dish onto a hot 
platter and pour the gravy around it. 
Steamed Potatoes 

Wash and scrape 6 medium sized potatoes, place in a 
steamer, set over the meat, cover closely and steam until 
tender, about i h. 
String Beans 

Break off the ends from the string beans, removing all 
the strings at the same time, then break into i inch lengths. 
Wash well, cover with cold water, and bring quickly to the 
boiling point. Drain, cover with hot water, adding i t salt 
for each quart of water, boil gently until tender, 40 to 60 m. 
The first quick boiling and draining removes the strong 
flavor string beans often have, and hence a more delicate 
flavor results. Use just enough water to keep from burning. 
Drain, add 2 T butter for i quart of beans, dash of pepper, 
shake well in the pan, and serve at once.

first thinning and heating the egg gradually by adding a lit- 
tle of the hot milk to it. Cook over hot water, stirring con- 
stantly, until the mixture coats the spoon. 

Note — If custard cooks too long and consequently curdles, 
pour it at once into a cold bowl and beat vigorously, prefer- 
ably with a Dover egg beater. This will often bring back 
the custard to its original smoothness. 
Preparing the Meal 

About lyi h before dinner time prepare the meat for the

bottom of each tart with a fork to permit the escape of the 
steam. 

Mash I cup strawberries with ^ sugar and fill the tart

reached. If too thin, add more sugar. 



S46 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Method of Work 

Start the bread, rolls, and coffee cake the first thing in 
the morning. If the latter is not set the night befo're use i 
yeast cake instead of ^. While the bread, etc., are rising, 
make the pastry, then set in a cool place while preparing 
the cherries. Finish the pie and tarts and place in t}ie 
oven. Ey this time the bread, rolls, and coffee cake can 
be kneaded down and set to rise again, the rolls and coffee 
cake being put into the pans for baking. Now make the 
nut loaf cake, and place in the oven. The pie will doubt- 
less be done by this time, and the strawberry filling made 
and the tarts filled. While the cake is baking the frosting 
may be made. This is one advantage of this kind of 
frosting, that it may stand a number of hours without de- 
terioration. Also it has not the raw taste that uncooked 
frostings usually have. Then make the salad dressing. 

As soon as the cake is out of the oven, put in the rolls and 
coffee cake, and work down the bread again and put into 
the pans for a final rising. By the time the rolls, etc., are 
baked, the bread will be ready for the oven and may be 
baked.

garnished with candied orange peel and served in orange 
cups, the pulp and the juice of the oranges being used in 
the f rtiit punch. The cream patties can , be flavored with 
orange and colored yellow. 

For a green color scheme, use green leaves for doilies 
under the punch cups, minced parsley should be sprinkled 
on top of the HoUandaise sauce for the fish, the sweet- 
bread croquettes laid on lettuce leaves, the cucumber jelly 
salad served in the green cucumber cups and set on a lettuce 
leaf, the parfait decorated with angelica and served in pale 
green paper cups, with the green mint patties. 

For a pink color scheme, strawberries and cherries, strips 
of red pimento, etc., can be employed in the garnishings. 

A wedding breakfast is supposed' to be served at about 
12 o'clock, but the above menu would be suitable for any 
hour. 

Seating of the Guests 

If there are a great many guests they should be seated at 
small tables, four at each table, and care takeh that persons 
congenial to each other be seated together. For the Bridal 
Party, however, a larger table is used and the guests seated 
as follows : The bride is seated at the groom's left, and 
this is the only time when husband and wife, as host and 



JUNE MENUS 353 

iiostess, should be seated together. At the left of the bride 
tS seated the best man, then the minister's wife, then the 
bride's father and the groom's mother. At the right of 
the groom is seated the maid of honor, then the minister, 
then the bride's mother and the groom's father. If there is 
room for more at this table, seat the bridesmaids and ushers, 
putting together such as are congenial.

Preparing the Breakfast 

_ The juice for the fruit punch, the sweetbread croquettes, 
timbale cases, rolls, cucumber jelly salad, grisini, bride's 
cake and the cream patties should all have been prepared 
the preceding day. The wedding cake should have been 
made some weeks previously, as the flavor is greatly im- 
proved by standing. Some make these cakes months and 
even years beforehand. 

Immediately after the early breakfast for the family cut 
the potato balls and cover with cold water. Also wash 
the parsley and lettuce which will be used, open the olives, 
rinse, and pour into the serving dishes, or arrange on the 
bread and butter plates 2 to each. Now prepare the pine- 
apple parfait and pack in ice and salt. Now shell the peas 
and let stand in cold water until ready to cook them. Mince 
the parsley for the potato balls. One h before serving 
time put the peas on to cook, then cook the potato balls. 
While these are cooking prepare the halibut turbans and 
put into the oven, then fry the sweetbread croquettes and 
set in a warm place until needed. Make the Hollandaise 
Sauce and 10 m before removing the fish from the oven 
reheat the rolls and the grisini. Arrange the timbale cases 
on plates ready for the peas, also put out the cucumber 
jelly salad, finish the fruit punch, putting a large piece of 



356 LESSONS IN COOKING 

ice in it so that it will be thoroughly cold, cat ti'ie cakes, 
and put the patties in serving dishes. Drain the potato 
balls, season and cover with the minced parsley. Drain 
the peas and add the seasoning, and keep warm until needed. 
The breakfast would, naturally, be served in course?. 
The first course is the fruit punch ; the second course, hali- 
but turbans, potato balls and olives; the third, sweetbread 
croquettes, peas in timbale cases and hot rolls; fourth, 
moulded cucumber jelly salad, grisini; fifth, pineapple par- 
fait, cake and patties.

REDUCING THE COST OF THE JUNE MENUS 

In the endeavor to lessen the cost of the meals served in June 
the local prices must have chief consideration. The prices used in 
the above calculations are omitted because they are now so 
variable. The prices of meat in large cities and in fashionable 
neighborhoods will generally be higher than those used in the 
middle West. Cn investigation it will be found that prices vary 
as much as 25 per cent in different localities of the same city. In 
dealing with shops in which low prices rule, it is usually neces- 
sary to make personal selection to obtain satisfactory quality. 

As suggested in previous months, using the top of the milk for 
cereals and coffee in place of cream will save about 32c. If butter 
is high and oleomargarine is available, its use in cooking will 
save about 15c. A small vegetable garden and cold frame for rais- 
ing rhubarb, lettuce, radishes, onions, mint, parsley, etc., will save 
about 25c. Substituting a cut from the chuck in L. 198 and 204 
would save about 10c in some localities. Omitting mushroom 
sauce to the meat souiHe in L. 207 would save 13c. Substituting 
molasses cookies for Coffee Charlotte Russe, L. 204, would make a 
difference of 20c. Using caramel syrup in L. 211 in place of maple 
would save 4c. The use of home grown cherries in a cherry pie 
of L. 213 and the salad of L. 203 would reduce the cost about 10c. 
Salad oil in place of 'olive oil in all salads would effect a saving 
of at least 10c. 

The total saving according to the above suggestions would 
amount to $1.39.

PART XI 



CANNING OF VEGETABLES 

In canning vegetables the same principal for preservation 
must be employed as for fruit — ^that of thorough steriliza- 
tion. As we cannot use either a strong sugar or acid 
solution to aid preservation, we are reduced to one method 
of sterilization — the employment of heat. Consequently the 
greatest caution and care must be taken to insure good 
results. Even then there may be some failures because the 
temperature used cannot, under ordinary circumstances, be 
raised above that of boiling or 2I2°F, and the spores of 
some bacteria are supposed to resist any temperature below 
240 °P. These developing later into active bacteria cause 
the vegetables to spoil. 

To prevent this a greater degree of success may be 
obtained by dividing the time of cooking into three parts, 
allowing. 24 hours or more to elapse between each period of 
cooking. This will give the spores time to develop intb 
bacteria, which are subsequently killed by the boiling, tem- 
perature. The third cooking should render the entire con- 
tents of the jar sterile. 

The commercial canners of vegetables heat the cans by 
means of steam under pressure and so obtain a higher tem- 
perature than 2i2°F. As it is not possible to do this in. the 
home, the intermittent method of sterilization should be 
used rather than long cooking for 3 to 5 h. By the inter- 
mittent method the full flavor and color are retained, where- 
as long, cooking has an unfavorable effect. 

Vegetables for canning must be freshly gathered, prefer- 
ably early in the morning while the dew is still on them. 

All green vegetables, such as peas, beans, corn, should be 
taken in the early stage before they lose the "sweet taste" — 
that is before the sugar is changed to starch. 
Utensils 

Where canning of vegetables is done in large quantities 
canners may be used, but the directions given here are for 
the use of the utensils found in the average home.

1. A wash boiler having a tight cover or a large steamer 
of the square type with doors. 

2. A rack or trivet on which to set the cans if a boiler is 
used. This may be made of narrow strips of wood, or pre- 




STBRimZER— WASH BOILEK WITH WIRE MESH BOTTOM. 

ferably of galvanized iron wire netting, i^, inch mesh, cut 
to fit the bottom of the boiler. 

3. The glass jars having glass covers and spring tops 
are the best to use. The screw top jars with covers which 
have a porcelain lining are not safe to use, for any vege- 
tables except tomatoes. Use pint or quarts, according to the 
size of the family. Always use new rubber rings of the best 
quality. 

Canned Corn

Corn should be canned within an hour of being shucked 
if possible. Husk the ears and remove all silk with a stiff 
brush. Cut the corn from the cob, being careful not to 
include any defective kernels. Pack into the jars, pressing 
it down and filling with cold water. Salt to taste — about 
I t to a quart and lay on the rubber rings and covers and 
set on the rack in the boiler. Surround with lukewarm 
water about 3 inches deep. Cover the boiler, bring quickly 
to the boiling point and steam for one (i) hour for pint 
jars and ij4 hours for quarts. Clamp down the covers and 
remove the jars and let cool away from any draft or leave in 
the boiler over night. 

The next day raise the spring clamp and steam in the

boiler for an hour or an hour and a quarter, then chimp on 
the covers and allow to cool. Repeat this process the third 
day. 

Set the jars aside for two or three days and then test 
them for thorough sterilization by releasing the spring clamp 
and picking up the jar by the edge of the cover. If there

has been the slightest decomposition, the gases formed will 
relieve the suction produced when the jars cool and the cover 
will come off. When this happens taste the contents of the 
jar and if the flavor is unaffected sterilize again and test 
once more. To open jars release the spring and insert a 
thin knife blade under the rubber next the jar. 
II. Without Hulls 



360 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Score each row of grains and press out the pulp, using 
the back of a knife. Pack into jars and proceed as above, 
steaming for one hour on three successive days. 

Canned Peas 

Select young, tender peas, shell and wash in cold water. 
Scald with boiling water, drain immediately and pack into 
jars, shaking down well. Fill to overflowing with water, 
having i t of salt to the quart. Adjust covers, set on the 
rack in the boiler and steam for an hour on three successive 
days, as directed for canned corn. If cans are not full, fill 
to overflowing with boiling water, being careful not to lay 
the covers down, as they may gather yeast spores. Be sure 
to test the cans for sterilization as described. 

Lima, Kidney or Other Shell Beans may be canned 
according to the process given for peas. If desired the 
preliminary scalding may be omitted, but this allows more 
of the vegetable to be packed in the can. 

Canned Asparagus 

Have the asparagus cut fresh and use only the tender 
stalks or portions of stalks. Wash and drain, cover with 
boiHng water and cook lo m. Drain, and when cool enough 
to handle, arrange neatly in jars with the heads up, using 
wide mouthed jars. Add j^ t salt to each pint jar, fill to 
overflowing with boiling, water, put on the covers loosely, set 
in the boiler and cool in the kettle. 

Canned Tomatoes 

I. Whole Tomatoes 

Select tomatoes that are small, even sized and solid. Scald 
and peel, being careful to remove the stem end. Arrange in 
Jars, fill with cooled boiled water, cover loosely, set in boiler, 
surrounded in water as in preceding cases, and boil J^, h. 
If necessary fill each can to overflowing with boiling water 
and fasten the lids. Imperfect tomatoes can be sliced, cooked 
and used instead of the boiled water to fill the jars. 

II. Stewed Tomatoes 

Prepare tomatoes as in the preceding directions, cut into 
halves or quarters, cook in porcelain lined vessel for about 
30 m. Sterilize the jars and fill with the boiling tomatoes 
to overflowing. Adjust the lids, screwing tight or sealing. 



JULT ilENUa 361 

Canned Corn and Tomatoes 

Prepare tne corn according to directions given in Process 
II, thus using only the pulp. Add to tomatoes, using equal 
portions of each and follow directions given for Stewed 
Tomatoes. 

Canned Beets 

Select small young beets. Wash and boil for 30 m. Re.- 
move the skins and pack carefully into jars. Fill the jars 
with vinegar and water, which has been boiled and cooled, 
using I part vinegar to 2 parts water. Adjust the covers, 
set in boiler, surround with water, as in the preceding direc- 
tions, and boil for % h. Tighten the covers and cool in the 
boiler. 

Carrots and turnips may be canned after this rule. Wash 
and pare, then boil for 30 m. and proceed as above, using 
plain boiled water instead of vinegar and water. 

PICKLING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

The principle of preservation in this case is the use of a 
strong acid solution, which is not favorable to the growth 
and activity of the bacteria. 

Fruits and vegetables both should be very firm and in 
perfect condition. In some cases the green fruit is used. 

Fruits as a rule are pickled alone, but with the vegetables 
many combinations are used. 

Sweet Pickled Peaches 

Select firm ripe, but not overripe, peaches, the cling stone 
being better than the free stone. 

Scald to remove the skins. If the peaches are not quite 
ripe this may not be successful, and in such cases they will 
have to be pared. 

Then weigh the fruit and stick each peach with four (4) 
cloves. To one part fruit use one-half as much sugar, one- 
eighth as much vinegar and one-half as much water as 
vinegar. 

Make a syrup of the sugar, vinegar and water, adding a 
sdck of cinnamon (about i oz. stick to each pint of vinegar). 
Boil about 20 m. and skim if necessary. Then drop peaches 
in, a few at a time, cook until tender, transfer to sterilized 



362 LESSONS IN COOKING 

jars, and when all the peaches have been cooked fill the jars 
up with the syrup. 

The skin may be left on the peaches, which should then 
be well rubbed to remove the fur, but they will require 
longer cooking. 

Pears, Apples, Plums may be pickled in the same way as 
peaches, the best for the purpose being the sickle pears, red 
crab-apples, either green gage or large blue or red plum. 
These are all left unpeeled. 

Cherries are pickled the same as peaches, selecting cher- 
ries having a good stem, and two, three or more in a bunch. 
Leave them on the stems. The cloves should be put right 
into the syrup instead of into the fruit. 
Spiced Currants 

Wash and drain the currants and remove from the stems. 
Weigh the fruit, and use in the proportion of i part currants, 
f^ part brown sugar and }i part vinegar. Put all together 
into a preserving kettle, add ground cloves and cinnamon, 
tied in a bag (i T to each 2 lbs. fruit), and cook slowly — 
about iJE4 h. Keep in a stone jar in a cool place. 

Ripe Cucumbers 

Peel the cucumbers, cut in quarters lengthwise, and re- 
move the seeds. Cover with alum water, allowing 2 t 
alum to each quart of water. Heat to boiling point and let 
stand in a warm place 3 h. Remove from the alum water 
and let stand i h. in ice or cold water. Weigh the cucumber 
at this point and make a syrup in the same proportions as 
for pickled peaches — -i part cucumber, j4, part sugar, % 
part vinegar and J^ as much water as vinegar. 
, Cook the cucumber in the syrup until tender. 
Unripe Cucumbers (Gherkins) 

To I gal. of pickles add i cup salt and cover with boiling 
water. Let stand 24 h, then pour off the water, heat to 
the boiling point and pour back over the pickles. Let stand 
for 24 h and repeat the above directions. Let stand for 
another 24 h. Then heat together i pint each of vinegar and 
water and a small piece of alum about the size of a hickory 
nut. Drain the cucumbers from the brine, pour over them 
the boiling hot vinegar and water with the dissolved alum, 
and let stand in that solution until firm — about 6 h. 



JVLY MENUS 363 

To I gal. of vinegar add 2 sticks of cinnamon, 2 T all- 
spice berries, 2 T cloves, i red pepper and i cup of sugar. 
Boil 10 m, then cook the cucumbers, a few at a time, drained 
from the alum water, for 10 m in I/4 the vinegar solution. 
Put the pickles in a stone jar and pour over them the rest 
of the vinegar. 

Olive Oil Pickles 

Slice 2 qts. green cucumbers very thin, cover with boiling 
water. When cold drain and cover with a weak brine and let 
stand 24 h, then drain. Mix together J4 t each cloves, all- 
spice and celery seed, i t cinnamon, J4 cup sugar, J^ cup 
mustard seed, J4 cup olive oil, 2 cups very thinly sliced 
onion and add to the cucumber. Mix well and add enough 
cold vinegar to cover thoroughly. Store in jars. 

Chow Chow 

Prepare and cut into small pieces 3 qts. small green 
tomatoes, 24 very small cucumbers, 4 red peppers, 2 large 
cauliflower, 3 bunches celery, lyi pints small onions. Put 
in layers in a crock with salt sprinkled between the layers 
and on top. Let stand 12 h, then drain off the brine. Cover 
with vinegar and water in equal parts and let stand another 
12 h. Drain again and pour over ^ gal. vinegar, which 
has been boiled 10 m with 4 lbs. sugar, i pint grated horse- 
radish, I oz. celery seed, J4 lb. mustard seed, J4 cup whole 
peppers, j^ cup turmeric, j4 cup cinnamon. Let stand until 
cold and then add i cup salad oil mixed with J4 cup ground 
mustard. 

Chili Sauce 

Peel and slice 18 medium sized ripe tomatoes and put into 
a preserving kettle. Add 2 small peppers and 2 small onions 
each finely chopped, 3^ c sugar, 1^4 T salt, 3 t each clove, 
cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, and i qt. vinegar. Heat 
gradually to the boihng point and then cook slowly 2}^ h

JULr MENUH 376 

Broiled Porterhouse 

Follow directions given on p. 14 for Broiled Beefsteak. 
Corn on the Cob • 

Carefully remove the husks and all silk from 6 ears of 
corn. Cover with boiling unsalted water and cook 10 m or 
until tender. Very young, tender corn needs very little cook- 
ing, while the older corn will sometimes require from 15 to 
20 m. If salt is added to the water, the corn turns a deep 
yellow color. 
Sliced Cucumbers 

Cut off the ends and pare rather thickly two medium sized 
cucumbers. Slice very thin and cover with ice cold salted 
water. Let stand ^ h or longer in the cold water. The 
slices will then be very crisp and fresh. Serve with oil and 
vinegar, salt and pepper, or omit the oil, as desired. 

Note. — Cucumbers are made more digestible by salting, 
and covering with boiling water. Let stand 2 m, then pour 
off and cover with cold salted water. 

Raspberry Sherbet 

Make a syrup of i c sugar and 2 c water, boiling 10 m. 
Crush together 2 c raspberries and yi c currants. Soak i t 
granulated gelatin in 2 T cold water 10 m, then dissolve over 
hot water. Add the fruit and dissolved gelatin to the syrup, 
^ c of which has been reserved. Mix all well together and 
freeze, using equal portions salt and ice. When half frozen, 
open the can, taking care that no salt gets into the sherbet, 
and add a meringue made by beating the white of i egg until 
light and then add }i c syrup to it. This meringue seems 
to make the grain of the sherbet finer and the gelatin pre- 
vents its ready dissolution. Finish freezing, pack in salt and 
ice and let stand several hours. 
Preparing the Meal 

Immediately after, luncheon, or in the morning, make 
the sherbet, freeze and pack. Also pare and slice the 
cucumbers and set away in salted ice water until needed. 
The long standing will haVe no injurious effect, but will 
merely make them more crisp and palatable. About ^ h 
before dinner time, wash and scrape the potatoes and put 
on the stove to boil. Also prepare the corn for cooking and 



376 LESSONS IN COOKING 

put on the stove lo m before serving. Corn should be served 

at once when done, as it deteriorates very rapidly when 

allowed to stand. If impossible to serve at once, remove 

from the water and keep warm in a dry place. Now broil 

the porterhouse and while that is cooking put the cucumbers 

onto salad plates, cut the bread and butter, fill the water 

glasses and put all on the table. Drain the potatoes and 

corn, and put into serving dishes, place the steak on a hot 

platter and serve the dinner.

shapes if possible ; then frost with colored frosting. 

Torpedo Candies 

For Torpedoes use Wilbur's Chocolate Buds. 
Preparing the Menu 

In the morning prepare the dough for the rolls, then pre- 
pare and mould the croquettes, and set in a cold place. Make 
the Strawberry Ice Cream and when frozen pack and let 
stand until needed. Work down the bread dough and set to 
rise again, then make the cookies, and while baking prepare 
the fruit for the salad, and also make the Lemon Cream 
Sauce. Mix the fruit and let stand until ready to serve, then 
add the Cream Sauce. Knead the dough, shape the biscuits, 
and set to rise. Scrape the new potatoes and with a vege- 
table cutter cut into balls, and let stand in cold water until 
ready to cook. If possible, cut the radishes and pickled beets 
into stars. Mould the butter in some fancy shape. A Sa.g 
or cannon ball would be very appropriate. By this time the 
rolls are ready to be baked, and should be put in the oven. 

About 1/2 h before serving time heat the fat for the cro- 
quettes, then put the potato balls on to cook. Fry the cro- 
quettes, draining them on soft paper. Make i c Medium 
White Sauce for the Potato Balls, then put the Lemon 
Cream Sauce on the Salad, and put out in sherbet cups. 
Keep in a cool place until needed. If necessary, reheat the 
rolls before serving, or retard rising by setting in a cold 
place and bake just in time for serving. 

Serve the croquettes, potato balls, radishes, beets, and hot 
rolls, then the salad, then the ice cream, moulded with a 
round scoop to represent cannon balls, cookies and candies. 

THE PICNIC LUNCH BASKET 

The picnic lunch basket afifords an opportunity for a dis- 
play of one's ingenuity in planning appetizing menus. The 
fact that food must be in such form that it may easily be 
carried limits the list somewhat, but notwithstanding this 
drawback many delicious things may be provided. Since 



388 LESSONS IN COOKING 

there is usually no way of keeping food hot, such as are not 
deteriorated by cold are selected. 

Among the suitable meats may be mentioned fried chicken, 
veal loaf, beef loaf, sliced corned beef, cold boiled ham, 
sliced roast pork, beef or veal, cold boiled eggs, pork and 
beans, etc. 

Then there are a number of good yet easily prepared 
salads, which are always acceptable, such as potato, salmon, 
eggs, stuffed eggs, shrimp and celery, beet and potato, com- 
bination, cold slaw, pickles, etc. 

The breads furnish a large variety, beginning with plain 
rolls, Parker House rolls, finger rolls, bread sticks, butter 
rolls, and ending, with sandwiches, as Russian, ham, cheese 
and salted nuts, egg, pimento, nut and cheese, meat, sar- 
dines, chicken, lemon butter, date and English walnut, fig 
and nut, etc. 

Among the sweets are doughnuts, cookies, oatmeal maca- 
roons, cakes, loaf cake, layer cakes with solid filling, sponge 
cake, salted nuts, stuffed figs and dates, candies, fruits of all 
kinds, jellies and jams. 

For lemonade, extract the juice of the lemons, add sugar 
in the proportion of J4 c to each lemon, put into glass jars 
or bottles and cover tightly. It is better to make a syrup of

FOOD ADULTERATIONS. 

The adulteration of foods should be a subject of great 
interest to the housekeeper from the economic as well as 
the food. value standpoints. 

Adulterations may be classified as follows: — (i) Substi- 
tutions,, (2) Partial Substitutions, (3) Use of Preserva- 
tives, (4) Artificial Coloring, (5) Artificial products, (6) 
Misbranding. 

Substitutions — a different article entirely is offered in 
place of the 'genuine, as for instance, the essence of the 
tonka bean, instead of the vanilla for vanilla extract, peach 
pits for almonds, horse flesh for beef, cotton seed oil for 
olive oil, glucose for honey, etc. In each case a cheaper 
article is offered at the same price of the more expensive. 
This, then, is simply a matter of deception, making the 
people pay for something they are not getting. 

Partial Substitutions — a part only of the genuine 
article is replaced by the adulterant, such as chicOry and 
parched grains mixed with coffee, ground nut shells, saw- 
dust, etc., in spices, glucose in place of sugar in jellies, pre- 
serves, candies, etc., stems of plants in tea, etc. Here as 
in total substitutions, the harm lies in the fraud perpetrated, 
as no injurious effects will result from the use of such 
articles. 

Preservatives, such as salicylic, benzoic acid, boric acids 
and formaldehyde in canned fruits and vegetables, catsups, 
mince meats, milk, and meat may have, however, injur- 
ious effects on digestion and nutrition, particularly for chil- 
dren and invalids. While it is true that their use has been 
very largely regulated by the pure food laws, nevertheless 
in some foods harmful preservatives are still used. If pres- 
ent in large quantities they rnay be detected by the flavor, 
but usually the amount used is so. small that detection, 
except by chemical tests, is difficult. - ■

Artificial Coloring is employed as a rule to intensify 
the natural color of the food product. Examples may be 
found in the use of copper to make green tea, in coloring 
pickles, beans, peas, tomatoes, etc., and in the dyes used in 
fruits, ice cream, confections, etc. The effects are injurious 
or not according to the dye used. In general the vegetable 
dyes are less harmful than the aniline dyes but a few of 
the vegetable coloring matters are injurious and some of 
the aniline dyes have no effect on digestion. 

In ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTS a manufactured article is used in 
place qf the natural one. Fruit flavorings in which nothing 
but chemicals have been used to obtain the desired flavor, 
such as banana, peach, strawberry, raspberry, pineapple, 
etc., are striking examples of artificial products. Commer- 
cial glucose made by treating starch with acid, wooden nut- 
megs and oleomargarine are other examples. 

Misbranding is the form of deception practiced most 
often upon the housekeeper. While the pure food laws have 
required the proper naming of the article, and the printing 
of the formula upon the label, the latter is usually done in 
such a way as to escape' the notice of the less observant as it 
appears in very fine print compared to the name. For ex- 
ample a bottle of vanilla is labelled "Vanilla" in very large 
type, while the word "Compound" is printed in very small 
type beneath it. Consequently in purchasing look carefully 
at the label to be sure yon are getting and paying for what 
you want as far as you are able to see. 

While many of these substitutions, adulterations, etc., do 
not lessen the food value .of the article, they do decrease 
its economic value; consequently it is wise for the house- 
keeper to know some of the methods of adulterations and 
the tests for their detection. 

The following are some of the simpler methods for the 
detection of adulterations in foods : 

To Detect Adulterants in Coffee 

I. Shake some ground coffee in cold water. Pure coffee 
usually floats on the surface, while ordinary adulterants 
sink; chicory colors the water a brownish red. 



AUGUST MENUS 391 

To Test Extracts 

1. Vanilla 

Evaporate a quantity of the extract to about y^ its orig- 
inal voliune. Add enough water to restore the first volume. 
The resins which give the flavor will appear as a brown 
feathery mass which sinks to ttie bottom or "precipitates." 
If a precipitate is formed, add a few drops of hydrochloric 
acid, stir, filter through a small funnel in which filter paper 
is folded and wash out the acid by pouring water through 
the filter three or four times. Dissolve the precipitate on 
the paper with a little alcohol. Divide this into two por- 
tions. To one add a piece of ferric alum, and to the other 
a few drops of hydrochloric acid. If neither produces more 
than a slight change of color, the pure extract of the vanilla 
bean was used. If there is a distinct change of color, ex- 
tracts from other sources are present. 

2. Lemon 

To a test tube nearly filled with water add i t of the ex- 
tract. If the real lemon is present it. will come out of solu- 
tion and will give a turbid appearance to the solution, and 
will form an oily layer on the top of the water. If the solu- 
tion remains clear after diluting with water, very little if 
any oil of lemon is present. 

To Test for Sulphides 

1. Wet the sample of meat or other food with water 
and stir well. 

2. Pour into a flask or wide mouth bottle and add small 
pieces of pure zinc and a little hydrochloric acid. If sul- 
phide preservatives are present the unpleasant odor of 
hydrogen sulphide will be noticed. To test this dip a piece 
of filter paper into lead acetate solution and suspend it in 
the flask. A black color on the paper indicates the presence 
of hydrogen sulphide. 

To Detect Alum in Baking Powder 

1. Put some logwood chips in a small agate-ware dish, 
cover with water, and bring to a boil. Throw the water 
away. Do this three times, then save the fourth extract. 

2. Fill a test tube about half full of water and add i t 
baking powder. Warm it and shake till effervescence 



392 LESSONS IN COOKING 

ceases, then add a drop or two of hydrochloric acid' to make 
the solution acid. 

3. To this solution add 4 or 5 drops of the logwood ex- 
tract. A bluish red color indicates the presence of alum. 
A yellow color shows its absence. Try ,a small bit of alum 
dissolved in water with the logwood extract to become 
familiar with the color. 
To Test Ice Cream 

1. For glucose: 

Add an equal quantity of Fehling's solution to i t of the 
cream to be tested and boil. If a red precipitate appears 
glucose is present. 

2. For starch: 

Add a few drops of tincture of iodine. A dark blue color 
indicates the presence of starch. 

3. For gelatine: 

To 3 T of ice cream add 6 T of cold water and 3 T of 
acid mercuric nitrate. Shake vigorously, then let stand 5 
minutes. Filter through filter paper. If much gelatine be 
present, it will be impossible to get a clear solution. Mix 
a portion of the filtrate with an equal amount of a strong 
("saturated") water solution of picric acid. If any gelatine 
be present a yellow precipitate will be produced immediately. 

To Test for Artificial Coloring in Candy and Jellies 

1. Place some of the sample in water and boil to dis- 
solve it. 

2. Place in this liquid a few pieces of white woolen 
yarn, and boil for 5 or 10 m, stirring occasionally. 

3. Remove the yarn and wash in hot water. If it re- 
mains brightly colored, the presence of artificial dyes is 
shown. 

4. To make the test more certain boil the yarn so colored 
in dilute ammonia for 5 m. The artificial coloring matter 
will dissolve in ammonia. If this is colored, add hydro- 
chloric acid drop by drop until the solution is acid as tested 
by blue litmus paper. 

5. In this solution now place some fresh white yarn and 
boil. 

6. Remove and wash in water. If the yarn is colored 
the presence of artificial dyes is proved for certain. 



AUGUST MENUS 393 

To Test for Preservatives in Milk 

1. Formaldehyde: 

Place in a test tube 3 T of milk and add an equal volume 
of concentrated sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, and a piece 
of iron alum about the size of a pin head. Mix the liquids 
with a gentle rotary motion. 

Place the tube in a dish filled with boiling water and 
allow to stand 5 m. A purplish color of the mixture shows 
the presence of formaldehyde. 

2. Borax or Boric Acid: 

Dissolve J4 t alum in i c water and add J^ c milk. 
Shake vigorously and filter. Pour a part, about i T, of the 
filtrate into a test tube and add a few drops of concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid. 

Dip a piece of turmeric paper into this and dry it over a 
gas flame. Place a drop of strong ammonia on the paper. 
A cherry red before adding the ammonia and a dark green 
or greenish black color after, shows the presence of borax 
or boric acid. 

To Test for Oleomargarine 

1. Melt a small bit of the sample in a spoon, stirring 
with a splint of wood. Oleomargarine and renovated butter 
sputter and boil noisily without producing foam, while real 
butter boils quietly and produces much foam. 

2. Fill a test tube half full of skimmpd milk, heat and 
add I teaspoonful of the sample of butter. Stir with a 
splint until the fat melts. Now place the tube in very cold 
water or in ice until the fat hardens, stirring all the time. 
If the sample is oleo, it will harden in one mass and may be 
lifted out on the splint of wood. If it is butter either 
fresh or renovated, it solidifies in small particles scattered 
all through the milk. 

To Test for Cottonseed Oil 

I. Add 2 or 3 T Halphen Reagent (prepared by the 
druggist) to an equal volume of the suspected oil in a test 
tube or small bottle. Heat very carefully to avoid burning 
in a vessel of boiling salt water made by dissolving i T salt 
in I pt. water. Boil IC^-I5 m. At the end of that time a 



394 LESSONS IN COOKING 

distinct reddish color indicates a small amount of cotton 
seed oil, a dark red color, a large amount of cotton seed oil. 

Before making tests always try the method with a small 
amount of the substance being tested for present, so as to 
become familiar with the color or precipitate produced. 

The chemicals, test tubes, filter paper, etc., required in 
these tests can be obtained at almost any drug store. An 
alcohol lamp can be used as a source of heat if gas is not 
available. Further tests are described in Bulletin No. lOO 
of the Bureau of Chemistry, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, 
which may be obtained by sending loc (coin) to the Super- 
intendent of Documents, Washington, D. C. 

Each State has its own laws in regard to adulteration of 
foods ; the National laws apply only to food products enter- 
ing into interstate commerce. Send to your State Board 
of Health or Pure Food Department (at the capitol city) 
for ypur local regulations and reports,

Cro-vm Roast of Lamb 

Select parts from 2 loins containing ribs, scrape the flesh 
from the bone between the ribs, as far down as the lean 
meat, and trim off the backbone. Keeping the ribs on the 
outside, shape each piece in a semi-circle and sew together 
to form a crown. Trim the ends of the bones evenly and 
do not leave them too long. Cover the end of each with a 
small cube of salt fat pork or wrap each rib with bacon to 
prevent the bone from burning. Roast 1% h or until tender 
throughout. Remove the cubes of fat before serving. The 
center of the crown may be filled with the peas. 
Peas 

Shell I qt. or 3 pints of peas and cook in a small amount 
of water till tender, see p. 293, adding salt the last 15 m. 
Sliced Tomatoes and Cucumbers

Invitations 

For a formal dinner the invitations should always be writ- 
ten rather than verbal and should be sent out two weeks in 
advance. The reply should be sent the day following the 
receipt of the invitation. 

The hour at which a formal dinner should be served de- 
pends greatly upon local custom. From 7 to 8 is the usual 
hour, although in some places it may be set as late as 8:30 
and even 9. 

S editing of Guests 

If the company is not large the gentlemen are informed 
by the hostess as to which ladies they are to escort to the 
table, but when there are a large number present a tray 
holding small addressed envelopes is passed to the gentle- 
men as they enter the drawing room. Each selects the 
^velope bearing his name and finds on the enclosed card 
the name of the lady he is to escort to the table. The side 
of the table on which they are to find places is indicated by 
the letter R or L in one corner of the envelope. At each 
cover is a plain card on which is distinctly written the name 
of the guest who is to occupy the seat. The host, with the 
most distinguished lady present, or the one in whose honor 
the dinner is given, and who sits at his right, leads the way 
to the dining room. The hostess, with the gentleman who 
is to sit at her right, is the last to leave the drawing room. 



AUGUST MENUS 415 

The host sits at the farthest side of the table, thus enabling 
the hostess to find her place without passing those who have 
preceded her. At the close of the dinner all rise, the hostess 
making the first move. The ladies pass to the reception 
room, where they are served with coffee, while it is served 
in the dining room or library to the gentlemen, who have 
remained behind to smoke. After dinner the guests of 
honor should be the first to leave. 

The Table 

The table on which a formal dinner is to be served should 
be covered first with a silence cloth, then with a heavy 
damask tablecloth. A bare table should never be used on 
such an occasion. A low centerpiece of flowers is the most 
suitable decoration. If candles are used there should be 
enough to furnish sufficient light without the aid of gas or 
electricity. 
Laying the Table 

Allow 2 to 2j4 ft. between each "cover" or place. 

Set service plate in center, i in. from edge of table. 

At right of plate from the inside out, lay knife with cut- 
ting edge toward plate, soup spoon and small fish fork for 
canapes. 

At left of plate, from the inside out, lay the ice-cream 
fork, the salad fork and the meat fork ; then the napkin, with 
outside corner toward the plate. 

Keep all on a line i inch from edge of table. 

Set glass at end of knife. If bread and butter are to be 
served, set bread and butter plate at the end of the fork 
with butter spreader laid across it. Butter plates may be 
used instead of bread and butter plates. 

Place salt and pepper shakers between each two guests. 

The olives may be put on the table, or left on the side 

table and passed. , , , , , 

The coffee spoons should be put on the table at each place 
when the coffee is served. , „ , .1 

On the side table should be arranged all the spoons, forks 
and extra dishes to be used in serving a tray with a doily 
on it the dishes of nuts, olives, bonbons, etc a dish of 
cracked ice and a carafe of cold water. A napkin or towel 
for emergency, and finger bowls containing water. A thm 



416 LESSONS IN COOKING 

slice of lemon, a rose geranium leaf or flower leaf, each 
set on a plate with a doily. 

Sherbet cups and dessert plates for serving the ice and 
frozen pudding should be set in the refrigerator. 

The dishes for the hot food put where they will keep 
warm. 

The fish canapes should be on the table and the glasses 
filled and everything in readiness when the waitress steps 
to the door where the guests are and says, "Dinner is 
served." 

Serving 

If there are two maids to serve the dinner, one serves 
first the lady on the right of the host, the other the gentle- 
man on the right of the hostess, and so on in order until 
all have been served. In serving the next course the lady 
and gentleman on the left of the host and hostess respec- 
tively, are served first, and thus in regular order throughout 
the dinner. If there is but one maid she begins first at the 
right, then the left of the host, then the right and then 
the left of the hostess. In this way, each time either the 
host or hostess is the last to be served. 

Custom, however, is changing and of late many prefer 
that the host and hostess be the first served. In this way 
they wait the longest before the food served is eaten. Also 
when some unusual dish is offered, they set the example 
both as to its disposition and to the manner of eating. 

Fish Canapes 

Rub I c cold cooked fish from which all skin and bones 
have been removed, to a paste, add ^ c creamed butter, i T 
Worcestershire Sauce, and a few grains cayenne. Spread 
on circular pieces of toasted bread and press in the center 
of each an olive from which the stone has been removed 
and the cavity filled with the fish mixture. Serve on lettuce 
leaves. Garnish with the whites of 4 hard cooked eggs 
chopped fine, and the yolks pressed through a sieve. 

Bouillon 

Cut 2 pounds of meat and bones into small pieces. Re- 
serve J^ of the meat and place the rest in soup kettle, cover 
with 2 qts. cold water and let stand i h. Saute the reserved 



AUGUST MENUS 417 

portion of the meat in i T drippings or butter, with 2 T 
chopped onion; when it is a dark rich brown add it to the 
soup in the kettle, rinsing carefully all the "good" from 
the skillet. Bring slowly to the boiling point and simmer 
for 6 h. Then add 2 t mixed herbs, 4 cloves, 4 allspice 
berries, 2 t salt, 4 peppercorns, 2 T each, potatoes, toma- 
toes, corn, cabbage, turnip, carrot, onion, etc. The vege- 
tables should all have been cubed and soaked in cold 
water. Cook i h longer and strain, and cool. The fat 
rises to the top of the stock and forms a seal. When 
ready to use remove by simply taking off the top layer of fat 
when the stock is cold, then dip a napkin in hot water, wipe 
off the top of the stock and around the bowl, thus removing 
every particle of fat. Note. — The layer of fat forming a 
seal keeps the stock from spoiling. Do not let the seal be 
broken if you wish to keep the stock any length of time. 
If it is broken heat the stock and let it form again. 

To clear the stock, after removing all the fat add the 
slightly beaten white and the finely broken shell of i egg 
to each quart of stock, while cold, beating it through the 
liquid. Set the stock on the stove, stir constantly until it 
reaches the boiling point, then simmer 20 m. Remove the 
scum and strain the stock through a cloth. Season before 
cleaning if it is necessary to add more than was put in at 

first. 

Egg BaUs 
Rub the yolks of 4 hard cooked eggs to a paste, add a 

dash of salt, speck of pepper, 6 drops Worcestershire 

sauce, and i t melted butter. Moisten with the beaten yolk 

of I egg, and shape into small balls. Roll in flour and saute 

in butter. Serve in the bouillon. 

Pulled Bread 
Pare the crust from a loaf of French bread. With two 

forks divide the loaf into halves, then quarters, and eighths. 

Break into 3 in. lengths, and brown slowly in the oven. 

Fillet of Beef 
The tenderloin of the beef which lies under the loin and 

rump is called fillet of beef. Wipe, remove the sinewy 

covering on one side, and the superfluous fat on the other. 

Lard the upper surface with salt pork, dredge with flour 

and bake >^ h. Baste frequently with fat from salt pork

or from the stock kettle; the latter is used on account of 
the flavor of vegetables, or the fillet may be laid on a bed 
of vegetables. When half done season with salt and pepper. 
Serve with Horseradish Sauce.

Select medium sized firm tomatoes, wash well, and cut a 
slice from the stem end of each. Scoop out the seeds atid 
soft pulp, saving it for future use, sprinkle the inside of 
the tomatoes with salt, and invert for several minutes. Cut 
equal portions of cucumber and radish into ^ in. cubes, 
add the most solid portions of the tomato pulp, mix with 
salad dressing, and refill the tomato cups. Set in a cold 
place until ready to serve. 
Salted Triangles 

Beat I egg slightly, add j4 t salt, then enough flour to 
make a very stiff dough. Knead until elastic, then roll into a 
very thin sheet and dry. Cut in triangles about 2>4 inches 
on the sides and fry in deep hot fat to a delicate brown. 
Dust with salt and serve with salad. The dough can be 
made and rolled out a day or so before using if convenient.

34 pound figs, chopped fine, and i qt. thin cream ; coot and 
add 2 T vanilla, ji c orange juice, yi pound English wal- 
nuts chopped fine. Freeze. 

Cafe Noir 

For cafe noir or after dinner coffee use twice as much 
coffee as required for breakfast coffee or >4 c of ground 
coffee to I c water. Otherwise follow directions given on 
page II. 

After dinner coffee is served with or without sugar, as 
desired, but not with cream. It has a decidedly stimulating 
effect on the digestive organs and for that reason its use 
after a heavy dinner is advantageous. 

Preparing the Dinner 

The bouillon should be prepared the preceding day and 
set aside to cool. 

In the morning remove the fat and clear the bouillon, 
chill if desired cold. Then make the salted triangles, and 
cook the fish if necessary, make the paste for the canapes, 
and set aside until needed. Prepare the tomatoes and rad- 
ishes and set away to chill. Also pare and cut the cucum- 
bers and stand in salted ice water. Make the custard for 
the frozen pudding and set away to cool. Cook the eggs 
for the egg balls. 

After lunch freeze the Frozen Pudding, pack, and set 
away to ripen. Make the currant ice and freeze. Arrange 
the salted nuts, olives, bon bons, macaroons, and wafers on 
dishes for serving, and set away until needed; prepare the 
egg balls for sauteing; cut the bread for the canapes and 
prepare the Pulled Bread. Lay the table and have 
dishes ready for use. About i^ h before dinner, wash, 
pare and parboil the potatoes. Make the corn souffle and 
place in the oven. Now prepare the fillet of beef and put 
in the oven, arranging the potatoes in the pan with it. 
Toast the pulled bread, and the bread for the canapes. 
Saute the egg balls, and if the bouillon is to be served hot, 
reheat. Make the horseradish sauce. Place nuts and olives 
on table and pour the water. The cafe noir should be made 



420 LESSONS IN COOKING 

after the dinner has been served, as otherwise it would 
have to stand too long. 

Serve the fish canapes, then the bouillon with the egg 
balls and the Pulled Bread. The beef should be placed on 
a platter and garnished with parsley, and served with the 
potatoes, souffle, and ice. The salad and salted triangles 
are next served, followed by the frozen pudding, bon bons, 
and macaroons. The cafe noir, wafers and cheese are 
served last. 

Bread and butter is not usually served with a formal 
dinner but may be if so desired.

LESSONS IN COOKING 



SUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING THE COST OF 
THE AUGUST MENUS 

Substitute oleomargarine or crisco for butter in cook- 
ing. Use top of milk in place of cream for cereal and cof- 
fee. In cooking with milk reduce by adding half water, or 
by using skimmed milk at a quart, as suggested before. 

In L. 239 omit the orange omelet. Use Hamburg Roast 
in place of Leg of Lamb in L. 241, also omit the pineapple 
and cheese salad and use plain sliced peaches instead of 
Peaches in, Bloom. In L. 242 omit the iced melons. In 
L. 244 make the ice cream with a custard foundation, thus 
using I pt. instead of i qt. of cream. Also omit the hot 
sauce for the cream. Omit the gooseberry crush in L. 245, 
also the cocoanut cake in L. 247. In L. 25 1 omit the black- 
berries and in L. 253 use banana instead of apricot and plum 
salad ; here also serve lemon ice instead of cantaloupe sher- 
bet. Omit the plums in L. 254. In L. 256 rice the potatoes 
instead of serving them with butter sauce. Use breaded 
veal cutlets instead of crown roast of lamb in L. 258, and 
also omit the fruit soup. As suggested above, use the cus- 
tard foundation for the peach ice cream also.

AUGUST MENUS 423 

QUICK MEALS FOR HOT WEATHER 

Lessons in Cooking was planned as a graded course, sim- 
ple meals being given first. As they gradually increase, in 
difficulty, the meals for June, July and August are somewhat 
complicated. While they may easily be served during the 
month, they are not ideal for extremely hot weather. At 
such times the cooking should be planned so that the use of 
the stove is necessary only during a short period of the day, 
preferably in the morning. To do this requires planning, 
but the thought necessary will be repaid. 

"Stock adjuncts," as they may be called, made at a con- 
venient time and kept on hand, with the help of the Emer- 
gency Supplies referred to on page 287, will admit of the 
planning of many attractive meals requiring very little time. 

STOCK ADJUNCTS 

Salad Dressing 

Make without milk as suggested on page 62, from the 
recipe given on page 29. It will keep indefinitely. 
Soft Custard 

Page 139. Make up a quart or two of this and keep on the 
ice for sauce or for making quick desserts. 
Fruit Syrups 

When preserving fruit make a larger quantity of syrup 
than necessary and put it into pint jars for desserts and 
cold drinks. 
Thin Sugar Syrup 

For use in making lemonade, orangeade, etc. 
Cold Tea 

Make a strong infusion and keep in glass or porcelam. 

Cold Coffee • , . , . ^ «■ 

Make strong and keep in glass or porcelam for iced coffee 

and flavoring. 

Cold Chocolate , . , .„ j 

This will keep sweet longer if made without milk, accord- 
ing to recipe on page 37, but it will be well to add enough 
water so that it will be sufficiently thin to blend with milk 
when cold. 
Cheese • • 

Grate dried pieces of cheese and keep in a closed fruit jaii 
in a cool place. Use for salads, sandwiches, etc. 



424 LESSONS IN COOKING 

PREPARED FOODS 

Hard Cooked Eggs 

Cook a dozen or more at a time and use for creamed eggs, 
egg salad, ' deviled eggs, garnishing salads, meats, etc. 
Cold Boiled Potatoes 

Cook double or treble the quantity and keep for potato 
salad, sauted potatoes, quick scalloped potatoes, creamed 
potatoes, or potato soup. 
Cold Cooked Vegetables 

Cook more than necessary of all kinds of vegetables and 
keep ready for salads. 
Cold Meats and Fish 

Have them ready for slicing, creaming, salads, etc., or 
make into jellied or pressed dishes. Cold ham, tongue and 
corn beef are particularly acceptable in hot weather. 
Cake 

Make plain loaf or sponge cake, doubling, the recipe, and 
when the first freshness has gone, use with fruits, soft cus- 
tards and cream for simple, quick desserts. 

Cookies 

That will keep well should be made when convenient in 
considerable quantities. 

Bread 

When baking bread make up pans of crusty rolls, cinna- 
mon rolls and coffee cakes. 

Pastry 

Make and bake pastry shells — pie and tart size. These 
will remain fresh for two or three days if kept in a cool, dry 
place. Uncooked pastry may be kept for a long, time in the 
refrigerator. 

All these foods may be made in the morning, while get- 
ting breakfast or immediately afterwards. When the oven 
is heated for one purpose, see that other things which may 
be used a day or two later are baked. 

There is seldom need of using a coal range during the hot 
weather ; even if gas is not available, the blue flame kerosene 
stoves are not expensive and give excellent results. 



AUGUST MENUS 425 

SUGGESTIVE MENUS 

The breakfasts given in the lessons are nearly all suf- 
ficiently simple for even the hottest weather. The follow- 
ing suggestive menus may illustrate what has been said. 

LUNCHEON 

CREAMED EGGS BREAD 

FRESH FRUITS COOKIES 

ICE TEA WITH FRESH MINT 

The eggs should be cooked at breakfast time and the tea 
made. Then lo m before luncheon make the cream sauce 
and heat the eggs in it. While it is cooking, ice the tea, 
prepare the fresh sprigs of mint by putting one in each 
glass, put the fruit, bread and cookies on the table and serve 
the eggs. 

LUNCHEON 2 

LETTUCE AND CHEESE SALAD BREAD AND BUTTER 

SPONGE CAKE ICED CHOCOLATE 

After breakfast make the chocolate and wash the head' 
lettuce, folding it in a cloth and place in the refrigerator. 
About 10 m before luncheon set the table and put on the 
bread and butter and cake, ice the chocolate and put the 
lettuce on the salad plates, sprinkle with the grated gheese 
and serve with salad dressing. 

DINNER— (Fireless Cooker) 

POT ROAST WITH POTATOES AND VEGETABLES 

LETTUCE SALAD BREAD 

FRESH PEACH COBBLER 

This is a fireless cooker dinner, and can be served from 
3 to 6 hours after it is put into the cooker, according to the 
heat used. With the radiators, less time should be allowed 
and less water put on the meat. The pot roast should be 
seared and browned nicely on all sides, put into the cooking 
vessel, surrounded by potatoes and vegetables — carrots, 
onions, parsnips, turnips, etc. — cut into inch cubes, seasoned 
well with salt, pepper, a bit of bay leaf and a few cloves, 
and water added. If the radiators are used a cup or pint 
of water is sufficient — if not, the meat should be nearly cov- 
ered with water, brought to the boil and transferred after 
20 m boiling to the cooker. 



426 LESSONS IN COOKING 

Fresh Peach Cobbler 

Fill a pastry shell with fresh peaches (or other fruit) that 
have been sliced and sweetened, and spread whipped cream 
or meringue on the top. 

Preparing the Meal 

Make the pastry shell for the cobbler in the morning or 
when the oven is in use. Then pare and slice the peaches 
and cover with sugar. Put the meat and vegetables into the 
cooker in the morning, or the necessary length of time before 
required and wash the lettuce. About lo m before time to 
serve the dinner, set the table, putting on the bread, butter, 
water, lettuce, etc. Whip the cream or make the meringue, 
then put the cobbler together. Open the cooker, put the 
meat on platter, then drain the vegetables, reserving the 
liquor for soup or gravy for the next day, and put them 
around the meat on the platter and serve. Iced coffee may 
be served with the dessert.

Preparing the Meal 

The veal should be prepared in the morning, the potatoes 
and eggs cooked and the soft custard made. About 15 m 
before serving, set the table, turn out the veal, finish the 
salad and make the cream of fruit and cake and put into 
glasses. Serve the dinner. 



AUGUST MENUS 42T. 

QUICK DINNER— (Hot) 

BROILED MEAT OR FISH CREAMED POTATOES 

SLICED TOMATOES 

FRUIT SALAD CAKE 

About 20 m before dinner time, pare and cut into I inch 
cubes, 6 medium sized potatoes and put on to cook in boil- 
ing salted water ; they will cook in about 15 m. When heat- 
ing the water for the potatoes, put in a little more than neces- 
sary. When it reaches the boil use enough to scald the toma- 
toes — then put in the potatoes. When the tomatoes are 
peeled and sliced, set in a cool place. Make the fruit salad, 
using, bananas and berries with a little grated cocoanut and 
sprinkle with sugar and orange or any fruit juice on hand. 
Broil the meat, set the table, cutting the cake, etc., and make 
the white sauce (p. 38) for the potatoes. IDrain the pota- 
toes, add the sauce. Put meat onto the hot platter, season 
well and serve the dinner. 

If there is no cake on hand, one of the many varieties of 
prepared wafers may be used or tea cakes may be made, 
using the recipe for "Lightning" cake, p. 374, and baked 
after the dinner is started.

SUPPLEMENTAST BECIPES 429 

Mince Pie 

Fill a shallow plate lined with plain paste with mince 
meat, cover with an upper crust made either of plain or 
puif paste, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Apple Pie 

Line a deep pie plate with plain paste (see page 130). 
Pare, core and cut 4 or 5 sour apples into eighths, and 
spread on the plate until filled. Mix J-^ c sugar, J4 t nv.*- 
racgTj H t salt, I t lemon juice, and a few gratings of lemon 
rind together and sprinkle over the apples. Dot with i t 
butter. Wet the edges of the lower crust, put on the upper 
crust, and press the edges well together. Cut a few slashes 
in the upper crust to allow steam to escape and bake 40 to 
45 m in a moderate oven. 

If desired the butter, lemon juice and rind may be omitted 
and cinnamon substituted for the nutmeg. Also dried apples 
which have been soaked for 12 h or more may be used in 
place of the fresh fruit. 

Pumpkin Pie 

Pare an-d cut into small pieces sufficient pumpkin, and

gether, and pour into a pie plate lined with plain paste. 
Do not use an upper crust. Bake in a moderate oven until 
the custard is set and the crust browned. Care must be 
taken that the oven is not too hot, as the custard is then 
apt to curdle. 

Squash Pie may be made with this recipe. 

Puff Paste 

Wash I pound of butter, patting all the water out of it. 
Into 4 c sifted pastry flour work 2 T butter, then add 
enough ice water to make a paste. Toss onto a floured

then the lower half up to the center, then the right side, 
then the left, each brought to the center ; then double. Place 



430 LESSONS IN COOKING 

in a cold place for 5 m or longer, then roll out, spread with 
another third of the butter and proceed as before. Chill, 
roll out again and spread with the last third of butter. Thor- 
oughly chill before baking. Bake in a very hot oven, having 
the heat from the bottom more intense than from the top. 

Patty Shells 

Roll puff paste % inch thick, cut with a round patty cut- 
ter, or doughnut cutter dipped in flour. Chill until the 
paste is stiff, then place on iron or tin sheet covered with 
brown paper, and bake 25 m in a hot oven. The shell 
should have risen to its full height in 12 to 15 m, and have 
become somewhat brown. The pieces cut from the cen- 
ters should be baked and used for patty covers. 
Fish Chowder 

Skin and bone a 3 lb. fish and cut into inch cubes. Cover 
bones and trimmings with cold water and simmer for % h. 

Cut a 2 inch cube of salt pork into small pieces, try out,

tender. Then add ij^ pts. scalded milk and 4 or 5 hard tack 
splits (water crackers). If desired thicker, sprinkle a 
little flour between each layer. 

Clam Chowder is made in the same way. 
Quick Frosting 

To 3 T fruit juice or cream add confectioner's sugar until 
it is the right consistency to spread and beat well. A speck 
of salt brings out the flavor. Hot water may be used and 
flavored with extracts — vanilla, almond, lemon, etc.
