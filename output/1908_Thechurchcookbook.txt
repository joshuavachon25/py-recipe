PREFACE 

The need of a cook book, which has the merit of embracing 
terse, easily understood receipts, has been emphasized. With 
this object in view The Church Cook Book is placed before the 
public for its approval. In its pages will be found numerous 
valuable receipts which have never hitherto appeared in print. 
Receipts from other sources which appealed to the compiler of 
being of special service to the users of cook books have been 
inserted, and acknowledges obligation for some of these to Mrs. 
Sarah Tyson Rorer, Miss Ellen L. Duff, the Baltimore Sun and 
Harper's Bazar. 

A Classified Alphabetical Index makes an easy reference to any 
receipt in the book.

SOUPS 

Fresh, canned or dried vegetables may be used for soups. 
Dried peas, beans and lentils have a higher nutritive value than 
meats or the best cereals so far as composition is concerned, 
being especially rich in proteid and starch. Vegetable proteid, 
however, on account of the cellulose which accompanies it, is 
less readily digested than the proteid of meat. The tough skins 
of dried peas and beans, etc., are wholy indigestible. The proteid 
of peas, beans and lentils is called vegetable casein from its 
resemblance in many respects to the casein of milk. 

Peas, beans and lentils have a small proportion of fat, therefore 
it is usual to add it in some form. They should be soaked in cold 
water several hours, and long cooking is needed to soften the 
cellulose and develop the flavor. A small quantity of cooking 
soda (bicarbonate of soda) added while cooking will soften them 
more quickly, but too much will injure the flavor. Vegetable 
soups are thickened with flour to prevent the separation of the 
thicker and thinner parts of the soup. 

Agate or porcelain kettles should be used in making soup. In 
meat soups the salt should be added at first to aid in extracting 
the juices in meat and cause the scum to rise. Allow 1 quart 
of cold water and a teaspoonful of salt for each pound of meat. 

Split Pea Soup 

i cup split peas 1 tablespoonful flour 

1 quart cold water 1 teaspoonful salt

in cold water. Drain off the water, and cook peas and onion in 



8 THE CHURCH COOK BOOK 

1 quart of water until soft. Press through a strainer, and add 
butter and flour cooked together. Add seasoning, and thin with 
hot water or milk, and reheat. Peas will not soften in salted 
water, so salt should not be added until they are cooked. A 
small piece of fat salt pork or a ham-bone may be cooked with 
the peas, and if so, the butter may be omitted. Lentil soup may 
be made as directed for split pea soup. 

Baked Bean Soup

1 minute, stirring constantly; add salt and pepper, and serve 
hot. If not used at once, cover to keep scum from forming. 

Baked Shad 

Take off the head, and, without cutting open, draw and clean 
the fish. Stuff with dry stale bread crumbs, into which has been

Butter Dressing for Fish 

4 tablespoonfuls of butter dash of cayenne 

J teaspoonful salt 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley

Broiled Fish 

Small fish may be cleaned and broiled whole, or they may be 
split down the back, the halves being separated or not, as pre- 
ferred. Large fish are cut into slices for broiling. 

For broiling, all fish should be wiped as dry as possible, and 
sprinkled with salt and pepper. Lean fish should be rubbed 
with melted butter or other fat, and the broiler should be well 
greased. 

The general rules for broiling fish are similar to those for broil- 
ing meat. The outside should be seared as quickly as possible 
by holding the broiler close to the heat, and the inside should 
then be cooked more slowly by holding the broiler farther away. 
Fish should be broiled on the flesh side first, then turned and 
cooked on the skin side long enough to make it crisp. Slices of 
fish should be turned frequently while broiling, and all fish 
should be well done, and served as soon as cooked.

MEATS 

The methods of cooking meat vary according to the object in 
view, which may be to extract the juice as in soups, broths and 
beef tea; to retain the juice, as in boihng, roasting, frying, etc., 
or it may be a combination of both these methods, as in stews, 
where it is desired to retain part of the juice in the meat, and to 
extract part of it, to enrich the gravy. 

The meat which is strained from beef tea, broth, etc., hasHttle 
or no flavor, according to the size of the piece and the length of 
time it has stood in the water. The chief muscle-proteid remains 
in the meat after the soluble albumen, etc., has been extracted; 
therefore this meat, although lacking in flavor, still contains con- 
siderable nutriment. If combined with fresh meat or vegetables 
and well seasoned, this tasteless meat may be made palatable as 
well as nutritious. 

Meat should be removed from the paper in which it is wrapped 
as soon as brought in from the store, as the paper will absorb the 
juice and may impart an unpleasant flavor to the meat. 

In cooking meats for soups and broths place in cold water to 
extract the juice, and do not add salt until done. 

Boiling 

Meats, when the juice is to be retained, should be put in boiling 
water, salted, and allowed to boil 10 minutes", then remove to 
cooler part of the stove and simmer until tender. 

Roasting 

In roasting the juice should be kept in the meat. The oven 
should be hot ; place on the shelf of the oven 10 minutes to harden 



MEATS 25 

the albumen on the outside; remove to the floor of the oven; baste 
every 10 minutes. 

Broiling 

The object in this method of cooking is to keep the juice in the 
meat. The meat is first held over a clear fire 10 seconds, until 
the albumen on one side hardens. Then as soon as the juice 
begins to rise, the meat is turned and the albumen on the other 
side is hardened. Continue to turn the meat once in 10 seconds 
until cooked. 

Stewing 

Stewing is cooking slowly or gently a long time in a small 
quantity of water. 

In stews, the meat and the broth, or the water in which the 
meat has been cooked, are served together, with or without the 
addition of vegetables. 

In making a stew, the object is to cook the meat in such a 
way that part of the juice will remain in the meat, and part of 
it may be extracted, in order to flavor the gravy or broth. 
This may be accomplished by dividing the meat, after cutting 
into pieces suitable for serving, into two portions. The juice may 
be extracted by putting the first portion into cold water, and then 
heating slowly to the boiling point. The juice may be kept in 
the other portion by adding it to the first when the water reaches 
the boiling point, or by broiling, or browning in hot fat before 
adding it. The whole should then be cooked gently 3 hours, or 
until the meat becomes tender. 

Tough meat is suitable for stews because it is juicy, and be- 
cause by this long, slow cooking in water, it can be made tender. 
The tougher portions of beef, mutton, lamb or veal may be used. 
Meat with some bone and fat makes a richer stew than one made 
with lean meat only. Pieces of cold cooked meat may also be 
used. 



26 THE CHURCH COOK BOOK 

Browning in smoking, hot fat helps to keep the juice in the 
meat, and also gives a richer flavor and color to the stew. The 
vegetables, also, are sometimes browned for the same reason, 
before adding to the stew. The pieces of meat are usually rolled 
in flour before cooking in the hot fat, to dry the surface, and thus 
make them brown more quickly. The flour also helps to thicken 
the stew. 

The vegetables commonly used in stews are onions, carrots, 
turnips and potatoes. Tomatoes, also, are sometimes used, 
as well as string beans and green peas. 

The usual seasonings are salt and pepper. Sweet herbs, 
parsley, a piece of bay leaf, one or two cloves, or a little catsup 
may be used to give variety, but care must be taken to use only 
enough of these materials to give a delicate flavor. 

Dumplings are often served with stews. 

The materials for a stew may be put into a covered pan or 
bean pot, and cooked in a moderate oven instead of on the 
stove, for the same length of time. This method is called brais- 
ing. Besides braising, other variations of stewing are : the fricas- 
see, smothering, pot-roasting, etc. 

Pan Broiling 

If not possible to broil meat it may be cooked in a dry hot pan. 
Fat is drawn from the meat in cooking and should be poured off 
from time to time. 

Beef Juice 

To obtain the pure juice of beef, heat in a double-boiler; press 
out the juice; do not add water; season with a pinch of salt.

Beef Stew 

2 pounds beef 1 carrot 

3 tablespoonfuls of flour 4 potatoes 
2 onions, sliced water 

1 turnip salt and pepper 

Beef from the neck, shoulder or lower part of the round may be 
used. Wipe meat with a damp cloth, and cut into 1 J inch or 2- 
inch cubes. Extra fat may be removed, and part of it heated to 
brown the meat. Put the poorer meat, as ragged, bony, gristly 
pieces, into a kettle; cover with cold water and heat to a boiling 
point. Heat the fat in a frying pan until smoking hot. Roll 
the more choice pieces of meat in flour. Put them into hot fat, 
and turn them until the surface is slightly browned. Brown the 
onions also, and put into the frying pan the rest of the flour, and 
if any remains after meat has been rolled. 

Put the meat and onions into the kettle when water reaches the 
boiling point ; rinse out the frying pan with a little of the water, 
and then return it to the kettle, which should be placed where the 
water will be kept very hot, but cannot boil. Cook slowly until 
meat is tender. Prepare turnip and carrot, and cut into thin 
slices. Three-quarters of an hour before stew is to be served, 
move kettle where water will boil and add turnip and carrot. 
Wash and pare the potatoes, cut into quarters, parboil 5 minutes, 
drain and add to stew; cook 20 minutes. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper, adding boiling water if necessary. There 
should be enough liquid to reach nearly to the top, but not to 
cover the vegetables. The stew may be thickened with flour 
if desired. Dumplings, if used, should be added 10 minutes 
before the stew is to be served. Place them so they will rest 
on top of the meat and vegetables. The stew should boil 
steadily during the 10 minutes required to cook the dumplings.

into a baking dish. Cover the top with a thick layer of well- 
seasoned mashed potatoes. Use a fork to form the potatoes into 
a mound, with the highest point in the center. Bake on the 
grate of a hot oven until the potatoes are slightly browned on top. 
More gravy will be needed than for the meat on toast, as part of 
it will be absorbed by the mashed potatoes. 

Hash 

Prepare meat as for cottage pie. Use equal parts of mashed 
or finely-chopped potatoes and meat ; mix together and moisten 
with gravy, water or milk. Allow from a teaspoonful to a table- 
spoonful of liquid for each cup of hash. Use more liquid if the 
hash is very dry. Season to taste. Other vegetables besides 
potatoes may be added to give variety. Heat the fat in a frying 
pan until smoking hot. Use from a teaspoonful to a tablespoon- 
ful or more, according to the quantity of hash. Spread the hash 
evenly over the bottom of the pan, cover, and place where the 
hash will heat slowly until a brown crust is formed on the bottom. 
Slip a knife under the hash, fold over double, and turn out on a 
warm platter. The hash may be formed into small cakes, rubbed 
over the top with melted butter, placed on a buttered baking

Crust for Meat Pies 

One quart of sifted flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of good firm lard 
well chopped in, 2J cupfuls of sweet milk, 1 teaspoonful of 
soda, wet with a very little hot water and mixed in with the milk ; 
2 teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, sifted into the dry flour; 
little salt; work quickly, and do not make very stiff. 

Yorkshire Pudding

of the dripping as possible will fall on it, and cook until done, 
nearly 30 minutes. Cut in squares and serve on the platter 
with the beef. 

White Sauce 

White sauce is used as the basis of many sauces and gravies; 
it may be made of milk, cream, or milk and water, thickened 
with flour or cornstarch, combined with butter; the usual sea- 



38 THE CHURCH COOK BOOK 

sonings are salt and pepper. The proportion of flour to each 
cup of Uquid varies from 1 to 2 tablespoonf uls ; the proportion 
of butter from 1 teaspoonful to 2 or more tablespoonfuls, ac- 
cording to the use to be made of it. One-fourth teaspoonful of 
salt is the usual quantity for each cupful of sauce, a little more 
being used if the amount of butter is small. Pepper is added 
according to taste. By substituting sugar and flavoring for 
salt and pepper, a simple pudding sauce may be made. 

Methods of combining the materials for white sauce: 

First Method. Substitute milk for water, and mix as for 
starch or flour paste; add butter, salt and pepper when cooked. 

Second. Melt the butter, and add all the flour ; when well 
mixed, add the hot liquid, one-third at a time, each time stir- 
ring until perfectly smooth before adding more liquid. 

Third. Warm the butter until soft, and blend the flour with 
it thoroughly ; add all the liquid at once, and heat, stirring con- 
stantly, until it boils 5 minutes. In the latter two methods, 
the seasoning may be mixed with the butter and flour, or added 
at the last. 

The first method takes longer, but it is preferable when sauce 
is to be used for those with weak digestion, as the cooking of 
butter is thought to render it less digestible. 

Mint Jelly

and the liquid is reduced one-half. Season, strain, and set 
aside until next day. Before using remove every particle of 
fat from the top, and the sediment from the bottom, as the least

VEGETABLES 

General Rules for Cooking Vegetables 

Wash thoroughly, pare, peel, or scrape, according to the kind. 
Let them stand in cold water until ready to cook to keep them 
crisp, or to freshen them when wilted, or to prevent them from 
turning dark. 

Cook in fresh boiling salted water, enough to cover and keep 
the water boiling. Allow 1 teaspoonful of salt to 1 quart of 
water. Salt may be added when vegetables are put in, except in 
the case of delicate green vegetables, as peas, spinach, etc., when 
it should not be added until they are nearly done. To preserve 
the color, cook green vegetables uncovered. Cook cabbage, 
onions and turnips, uncovered, in a large quantity of water; 
by changing the water once or twice during cooking, much of 
the strong odor and flavor will be lost. 

Vegetables should be cooked only until tender, drained when 
necessary, and served promptly. 

The water in which vegetables have been cooked is called vege- 
table stock, and if of agreeable flavor, may be used in making 
sauces to serve with the vegetables, or as a basis for vegetable 
soups, thickened with flour, combined with butter. Time for 
cooking varies, according to the freshness, age and size of vege- 
tables. They are cooked when a fork will go through them easily. 
Serve plain, with salt, pepper and butter, or with cream, milk 
or stock sauce. 

Seasoning 

To 1 pint of cooked vegetables, allow 2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter, i teaspoonful of salt, and J saltspoonful of pepper. 



VEGETABLES 49 

Scalloped Dishes 

Cold meats, or fish and oysters, some vegetables and some fruits 
are used in scalloped dishes. 

The crumbs for scalloped dishes are prepared from the inside 
of a loaf of bread, a day or more old. Grate the bread, or if 
dry enough, crumb by rubbing two pieces together. Cracker 
crumbs may also be used, but will need more liquid to moisten 
them. 

Place the food material in 2 layers, using one-fourth of the 
crumbs for the bottom of the dish, the other one-fourth in the 
middle, and the remaining one-half for the top. Buttered 
crumbs are used for the top. 

White Sauce 

1 tablespoonful butter i teaspoonful salt 

li tablespoonful flour white pepper to taste 

1 cup milk 

Scaldthe milk, melt the butter, add to it the flour, and mix 

thoroughly; add the milk gradually, stir until perfectly smooth. 

One-half cup of milk and J cup of vegetable stock may be used 

instead of all milk for a sauce for vegetables. 

Potatoes 

They should be kept in a cool, dark, dry place. If stored in 
a light place an unpleasant flavor will develop. 

Boiled Potatoes 

Choose potatoes of about the same size. Wash, pare thin, 
and drop at once into cold water to prevent discoloration. Cook 
in fresh boiling salted water, until a fork will penetrate them 
easily. When soft, drain, uncover, and shake gently over the 
heat until the outside is dry and mealy ; sprinkle a little salt over 
them. Serve hot in an uncovered dish. 



50 THE CHURCH COOK BOOK 

New potatoes have thin skins, so can be scraped instead of 
pared. In the spring, old potatoes are improved by soaking 1 
hour in cold water. 

Sweet potatoes are cooked in the same manner as white pota- 
toes. They are not usually pared, as without the skins they 
would lose some of the sugar to which they owe the sweetness 
which gives them their name. 

Masheui Potatoes 

6 medium sized potatoes 3 tablespoonfuls butter 

1 teaspoonful salt i to J cup hot milk 

I saltspoonful pepper 

Boil the potatoes, and drain them; mash in the saucepan in

beat until light and creamy, and pile on a hot dish without 
smoothing. 

Riced Potatoes 

Press hot mashed potatoes through a potato ricer, or coarse 
strainer, into a hot vegetable dish. Serve at once, or brown 
lightly in a hot oven. 

Baked Potatoes 

Wash and scrub potatoes of uniform size. Bake on the grate 
of a hot oven from 30 to 45 minutes, or until soft. Turn them 
every 15 minutes, to keep them from burning. Test by pressing 
them, with the hand wrapped in a towel. When soft, break open 
the skins, to let the steam escape, and serve at once. If any 
are left over, remove skins and use for warming over. 

Creamed Potatoes No. 1 

Cut cold potatoes into cubes, and for each cupful allow J cup 
of milk, J tablespoonful butter, J teaspoonful salt and a dash of 



VEGETABLES 51 

pepper. Heat the milk in a shallow pan, add the potatoes and 
stir slowly until they have absorbed nearly all the milk; add 
seasoning and stir until well mixed. Cook 5 minutes longer. 
Serve hot. One teaspoonful of parsley, chopped fine, may be 
added to the seasoning.

Creamed Potatoes with Cheese 

The sliced potatoes may be seasoned, put in a baking dish and 
covered with milk; grated cheese thickly sprinkled over the top. 
Cover, and bake until the milk is nearly absorbed; then remove 
cover, and cook until cheese is melted. The potatoes may be 
fixed in the same way, substituting bread crumbs in place of the 
cheese. 

Stuffed Potatoes 

Select good-sized potatoes, wash, and bake in a brisk oven. 
When cooked, remove from the oven and cut in half lengthwise. 
Remove the interior and pass through a vegetable press into a 
hot bowl. To each pint of potato allow tablespoonful of butter, 
teaspoonful of salt, J teaspoonful of white pepper, and J cup 
of hot cream. Whisk all together briskly until it looks light and 
snowy white, then add the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth.

To Wash Rice 

Put rice in a strainer, place strainer in a pan of water, and rub 
the rice between the hands ; change water 2 or 3 times, or until 
rice is clean, when the water will be clear. 

How to Boil Rice 

Prepare a sauce pan with water and a little salt. When it boils 
sprinkle in the rice gradually so as not to stop the boiling. Boil 
hard for 20 minutes, keeping the pot covered. Then take it 
from the fire and pour off the water, after which set the pot on 
the back of the stove with the lid off, to allow the rice to dry 
and the grains to separate. 

Remember — Boil rapidly from the time you cover the pot until 
you take it off, this allows each grain to swell to three times its 
normal size and the motion prevents the grains from sticking 
together. Do not stir it as this will cause it to fall to the bottom 
and burn. When properly boiled rice should be snowy white, 
perfectly dry, and soft, and every grain separate and alone.

SALADS 

Simple salads consist of fresh vegetables which require no cook- 
ing, as lettuce, endive, cress, etc. served with a dressing. Cooked

dressing is easily prepared, and is suitable for any salad. 

Salads should be prepared daintily, arranged attractively, and 
should always be served cold. 

Lettuce and other salad plants should be fresh, crisp and clean. 
Wash thoroughly, without crushing, leaf by leaf; chill in very 
cold water until crisp, and dry by placing on a clean towel, so that 
thewater will drain from the leaves; or fold lightly in a towel 
and place on ice until serving time. 

The dressing should not be added to green vegetables until just 
before serving as it wilts them.

CEREALS 

All cereals may be used for mush, and by using more water, 
may be made into gruel. Cold mushes may be sliced, dipped 
into flour, and browned in a small quantity of smoking hot fat. 

Directions for Making Mush and Gruels 

Use a double boiler; put the required quantity of boiling water 
and salt in the upper part of the double boiler, place directly 
upon stove, and when the water boils rapidly, stir the cereal slowly 
into it. If cereal is a coarse meal, stir it in dry ; if it is a fine meal 
or flour, wet it with an equal quantity of cold water before stirring 
it into the boiling water. 

Cook directly over the heat 10 minutes, stirring constantly; 
then place upper part of double boiler over the lower part, which 
should be one-third full of boiling water; keep the water boil- 
ing. The time for cooking depends upon the cereal used ; long 
cooking improves the flavor, and makes it more digestible. Do 
not stir more than once while over the boiling water. If mush 
or gruel requires thinning, use boiling water. 

Granulated wheat preparations, as wheat germ, wheatlet, 
etc., need nearly four times their bulk of water. To prevent 
lumping, sprinkle slowly into the boiling water, stirring con- 
stantly. Boil 10 minutes over stove or gas, and cook over 
boiling water 20 to 30 minutes. 

Shredded wheat biscuits have already been thoroughly cooked; 
they may be used as a breakfast cereal by dipping quickly into 
boiling water, and heating in the oven between buttered plates ; 
serve with milk or cream and sugar. 



CEREALS 71 

Rolled Oats or Rolled Wheat 

1 cup rolled oats or wheat 2 cups boiling water 

1 teaspoonful salt 

Pick over the cereal, and remove foreign substances; follow 
directions for making mush. Boil 10 minutes, stirring con- 
stantly, then cook over boiling water 20 to 30 minutes or longer. 
Serve with cream or milk, and sugar. Steamed apples and 
rolled oats make an agreeable combination. 

The rolled oats being crushed and partially cooked, need less 
cooking than coarse oatmeal. 

Coarse Oatmeal 

1 cup oatmeal 5 cups boiling water 

1^ teaspoonful salt 
Look over the meal ; follow directions for rolled oats, cooking 
from 8 to 12 hours. It may be cooked the day before it is needed, 
and reheated, adding more water if necessary. 

Oatmeal Gruel No. 1 

i cup rolled oats i teaspoonful salt 

1 cup boiling water 1 cup milk 

Prepare as for mush; cook in a sauce pan 30 minutes, stirring 
all the time, or in a double boiler 1 to 2 hours; strain the gruel, 
add the milk, and heat just to the boiling point. Serve hot, with 
1 tablespoonful sugar, and a sprinkle of nutmeg, if desired. 

Cold oatmeal mush may be used to make gruel by adding more 
water and reheating. It may be served strained or unstrained. 

Oatmeal Gruel No. 2 

^ cup coarse oatmeal 1^ to 2 cups of cold water or 

i teaspoonful salt milk 

Roll or pound the meal until floury; add one-third of the water, 
stir well, and let settle a few seconds; pour the milky-looking 



72 THE CHURCH COOK BOOK 

water into a saucepan; repeat twice, using remaining water, 
being careful each time not to allow any of the coarse portions 
to go into sauce pan. Boil 30 minutes, stirring, to prevent burn- 
ing. Add milk to make of desired consistency, and proceed as 
in Gruel No. 1. 

Molded Cornmeal 

1 cup cornmeal 1 cup of cold milk 

1 tablespoonful of flour 2 cups of boiling water 

1 tablespoonful salt 

Mix dry ingredients, add cold milk until smooth, then add 
boiling water. Cook directly over stove or gas 10 minutes, stir- 
ring all the time to prevent burning. Cook 1 or 2 hours over boil- 
ing water. If wanted for frying, turn into a wet pan to stiffen; 
cover to keep a hard crust from forming. When cold cut in 
slices i inch thick; dip each slice in flour, and brown in enough 
smoking hot fat to keep from burning. Serve hot. May be 
eaten with syrup or molasses, or caramel sauce or not as pre- 
ferred. 



BREAD 

White Bread 

1 pint milk 1 pint of water 

1 compressed yeast cake 1 level teaspoonful of salt 

Scald the milk, add the water, and, when lukewarm, add the 
yeast cake, dissolved, and the salt. Mix and add 1 quart of good 
strong flour; beat 5 minutes; then continue adding the flour, stir- 
ring all the while until you have the dough sufficiently thick for 
kneading. Dust the board with flour, turn out the dough and 
knead thoroughly until it is soft and elastic and perfectly free 
from stickiness. Do not add too much flour at a time; it is the 
kneading that removes the stickiness, not the flour. The bread is 
dry and tasteless where too much flour is added. The grain will 
be finer and the dough whiter and more elastic, if you devote the 
last 5 minutes to pounding with a good strong potato masher, or 
you may take the dough in your hand and drop it on the board. 
Put this back into the bowl or pan, cover and stand in a warm 
place (75°) for 3 hours. Now turn it out on the board, and 
carefully cut into 4 loaves. Mold each, put into greased pans, 
either the long French or the square pans, cover and stand aside 
1 hour; if in the square pans bake in a moderately quick oven 
(indicator at 8) for about f hour; if in the long French pans, in 
a quick oven (indicator at 9, temperature 400°) for 30 minutes. 
Where home made yeast is used, sponge must be made at night 
using J cupful of yeast. The dough must be kneaded early in 
the morning.

74 THE CHURCH COOK BOOK 

Home Made Yeast 

Pare and grate 4 good-sized potatoes into 1 quart of boiling 
water, and boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. When cool, add 
i cup of sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt, and 1 compressed yeast 
cake in J cup of cool water, or J cup of yeast that you have saved 
from the previous brewing. Turn the mixture in a stone or glass 
jar, cover and stand in a warm place (68°) for at least 3 hours, 
stirring down the mixture each time it comes to the top of the 
vessel. 

When fermentation has ceased, cover the jar closely and stand 
in a cool place to keep. 

Caution: The yeast must not be allowed to fall; it must be 
stirred down. It must be put into a cool place as soon as fermen- 
tation ceases. A large bottle is a good and convenient receptacle 
for keeping. Save J cupful of this yeast to start the next brew- 
ing. It will keep in a cool place in the winter for 3 weeks; in the 
summer, 10 days to 2 weeks. A cupful of this yeast will make 4 
loaves of bread; sponge made at night.

Twentieth Century Bread 

1 pint of milk 1 pint of water 

1 compressed yeast cake 1 level teaspoonful salt 

This bread, of course, is made from whole wheat flour. The 
liquids used may be either milk, or milk and water, or all water. 
Scald the milk, 180°, being very careful not to allow it to boil. 
Scald and add the water. When the mixture is lukewarm, add 
the yeast, dissolved in 4 tablespoonfuls of cool sterilized water, 
the salt, and then stir in sufficient whole wheat flour (about 1 quart) 
to make a stiff batter. Beat continuously for 5 minutes, lifting 
the dough into the air and folding it over. Remove the spoon

and scrape down the sides of the bowl; cover with a cloth or in 
a bread pan with the ordinary tin cover, and stand in a warm 
place (75°) in winter for 3 hours; in summer 2^ hours. By this 
time the mixture will be light and spongy. Stir in, slowly, suffi- 
cient whole wheat flour to make a dough. Turn this out on the 
bread board, which has been slightly dusted with flour, knead 
continuously until the dough is soft and elastic and has lost its 
stickiness. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 4 portions; 
mold each into a loaf; put into greased square pans, cover and 
stand in the same warm place 1 hour, or until the dough has 
doubled its bulk and feels very light when lifted. Brush the 
top carefully with warm water using for the purpose the pastry 
brush, and place it in moderately quick oven (360°) for J hour. 
When done, turn at once from the pans, resting the loaves so that 
the air will pass around them, and when perfectly cool, put them 
into a clean tin bread box. 

If home made yeast is used, add a cupful, making the sponge at 
night; stand it in a warm place (about 60°) from, say* 10 o'clock 
until 5 or 6 the next morning. Add flour and knead it and mold 
at once into loaves. The time for second standing must also be 

increased from 1 to 2 or 3 hours.

Graham Bread 

To make one loaf of Graham bread take 1 pint of whole wheat 
sponge when it is light and ready for kneading, add to it a table- 
poonful of molasses, and sufficient Graham flour to make a stiff 
batter; beat thoroughly, turn into a square greased pan, and 
when it has doubled its bulk and is light in weight, bake it in a 
moderate oven (300°) about | hour.

BUTTER AND MILK 

Devonshire Cream 

Put 3 or 4 quarts of fresh milk in a large pan, stand in a cold 
place for 12 hours; then stand over a pan of boiling water, with- 
out disturbing the cream; keep the water boiling until a line of 
bubbles i inch wide forms all around the pan of milk; take it 
from the fire, cool; skim off the cream with a perforated skim- 
mer. Serve over fruits, pies or pudding. Use the milk for any 
kind of cooking. 

Butter 

Put in a glass butter churn that comes for the purpose, and 
churn until the butter separates from the liquid portion. Collect 
the particles of butter with a spoon, pressing out as much of the 
milk as possible. Wash the butter in very cold water until the 
water is clear ; put butter into a dry bowl, sprinkle with the salt, 
and work the salt thoroughly into the butter with a spoon. Form 
butter into a cake or fancy shapes. The salt may be omitted. 

Butter Balls 

Small wooden paddles, or "butter-hands," plain or grooved, 
are used for forming butter into balls or other fancy shapes. 
Let the butter-hands stand in boiling water five minutes; then 
put them into very cold water, and chill thoroughly. Have 
ready a large bowl of cold water. Cut the butter into pieces f 
inch square, and drop into the cold water. Roll them lightly 
one at a time, between the butter-hands until of the desired shape. 
Arrange them on a fiat dish, and chill. Use a small fork in serv- 
ing them. 



94 THE CHURCH COOK BOOK 

Milk 

Sterilization will undoubtedly kill the germs in milk, but the 
high temperature required alters the flavor and also renders the 
milk less digestible for many. The method called pasteurization 
consists in heating the milk to 158° F. and keeping it at that 
temperature for 20 or 30 minutes. It is then cooled rapidly, and 
will usually keep 3 or 4 days when covered and kept in a cool place. 

Pasteurized Milk 

Fill sterilized bottles or jars nearly full with milk; cork with 
cotton which has been baked in the oven till yellow. Place bottle 
on a rest in a deep pan so that they will not touch the bottom 
of pan. Fill the pan with enough cold water to reach as high 
as the milk in the bottles. Place over the fire, and heat to 
158° F., if a thermometer is used. If not, heat until small bub- 
bles appear in the milk next to the glass. Remove to back of 
stove where milk cannot become any hotter; keep it there from 
20 to 30 minutes ; then place the bottles first in lukewarm and 
then in cold water until milk is also cold. Keep them in a cold 
place. Do not remove stoppers until ready for use. 

Sour Milk Cheese 

1 quart thick sour milk | teaspoonful salt 

2 teaspoonfuls butter 1 tablespoonful cream 

Put the milk into a sauce pan, and heat slowly until the curd 
separates from the whey. Place a piece of cheese-cloth in a 
strainer; place strainer over a bowl, and pour in the milk. 
Lift the edges of the cloth and draw them together and twist, 
pressing the curd as dry as possible. Put curd in a small bowl, with 
butter, salt and cream ; mix together lightly with a fork. 



BUTTER AND MILK 95

1 minute and pour over slices of toasted bread or crackers. 
Serve at once. 

Baked Crackers with Cheese 

Split common crackers in halves, and butter the inside slightly. 
Put them, buttered side up, in a pan, and bake in a hot oven until 
light brown. Remove from oven , and sprinkle each half with 
grated cheese. Allow for each whole cracker 1 tablespoonful of 
cheese, a few grains of salt, and pepper, if liked. Return to 
oven, and cook until cheese is melted.

EGGS 

Soft Cooked Eggs 

Put into a sauce pan enough boiling water to cover the eggs. A 
general rule is to allow 1 pint of water for 2 eggs, and an extra 
cupful for each additional egg. If eggs are very cold pour warm 
water over them before putting into boiling water, or use more 
boiling water. Put the boiling water into a sauce pan, place the 
eggs in the water with a spoon, and cover the sauce pan. Remove 
at once from the fire to the table and let stand 8 to 10 minutes. 
Serve in heated cups. 

Hard Cooked Eggs 

Cook in the same manner as preceding receipe, placing sauce 
pan on back of the stove, where the water will keep hot but not boil,

Have ready a shallow pan containing enough boiling salted water 
to cover the eggs, allowing 1 teaspoonful of salt to 1 pint of water. 
Before putting in the eggs place the pan where the water will 
keep hot but not boil. Break each egg separately into a saucer 
and slip it carefully in the water. Cook until the white is firm, 
and a film forms over the top of yolk. Pour water over the yolk 
with a spoon if necessary. Remove eggs with a skimmer, drain,

vegetable strainer, over the white sauce. Cover, and place in 
a moderate oven 5 minutes and serve hot. Hot cooked rice may 
be used instead of toast. The dish may be garnished with 
'Hoast points," made by cutting slices of toast into pieces about 
1^ inch square, and dividing each square diagonally. 

Steamed Eggs 

Separate white and yolk of egg. Beat white to a stiff froth, 
and put into a cup. Put the yolk (whole) into the center. Place 
cup in a steamer, or in a sauce pan containing enough boiling water 
to reach half way to the top of cup. Cover the sauce pan, remove

fruit with clean water, and let it soak several hours, if possible. 
Allow 1 quart of water for J pound of dried fruits. Cook until 
soft, in the water used for soaking. Long soaking, and quick cook- 
ing give a flavor most like that of the fresh fruit. During hot 
weather fruit is liable to sour when put to soak over night; to 
avoid this put it in the refrigerator while soaking. 

Stewed Prunes

of stick cinnamon may be cooked with it. 

Baked Apples 

Wipe and core sour apples ; they may be pared, if liked. Put 
them in an agate or earthenware baking dish; fill each center with 
sugar; use 1 teaspoonful of water for each apple, and pour it 
around, not over them. Bake until apples are soft, from 30 to 45 
minutes, basting them every 10 minutes. Place them in a dish, 
and pour the juice over them. Serve cold. 

Baked Bananas

beaten, the lemon rind and juice. Mix quickly, carefully and 
thoroughly, put at once into a baking dish, dust the top quickly 
with powdered sugar, and bake in an oven at 400° F. 5 minutes. 

Caution: The oven must be ready before you begin the souffle. 
It must be taken at once from the oven to the table. If it is 
stringy inside, it has been baked too long. To be right, it must 
be hot. It must be served in the dish in which it is baked. 

If you are an expert, put the souffle into pastry, use a star 
tube, and press it out on a platter, making either a large rope-

like mold or rosette. A pyramid of roses is always attractive. 
Dust it with sugar and bake as directed. An omelette souffle 
is one of the most elegant of desserts.

the top with powdered sugar, and bake in a quick oven 5 to 6 
minutes. Other fruit in the same proportion may be substi- 
tuted for prunes.

spoonfuls of powdered sugar, then the almonds ; stir lightly and 
pour into a buttered baking dish. Bake in a quick oven till 
a golden brown. 



CAKES 

Simple Rules for Cake Baking 

Always cream your butter and sugar to a very light cream, 
being careful to use a wooden spoon. Some cooks contend you 
can do it much better with your hands, but best results will 
be secured by the above method. 

Always separate and beat eggs very light, unless otherwise 
stated. 

Flour should be sifted several times, adding the baking powder 
in the last sifting. It is generally beaten in alternately with 
the well-beaten whites, except in sponge cake, when it is added 
last. 

Layer cake will not stick if the pan is well greased and dusted 
with flour. 

Do not have too hot an oven when baking cakes that require 
long baking, like fruit cake, ginger pound cake, pound cake, etc. 
Layer pound cake and small cakes require more heat. 

It is always safe to try them with a clean straw. If it 
comes out clean, without a particle of batter sticking to it, it is 
done. 

Another simple way is to run the fingers lightly over the top, 
and if there is no indentation, it is done. 

Never close oven door so as to jar the cakes, as it will cause 
them to fall. 

Turn out on a cakeboard to cool, so as to prevent the steam, 
from making them soggy. Never ice until cold. 

If you have to cut cake while hot, use a heated knife.

CANDY 

Eaten at proper times, candy is a useful article of food. It at 
present forms part of the rations of the soldiers in this country. 
It should not be eaten to excess, nor between meals. In cooking 
sugar for candy, use an agate or iron pan, as it is less Hable to 
burn than in tin. Butter pans for candy before it is cooked. 

Have ready some cold water in which to try the candy. 

WTien the candy is poured into the pan, do not scrape the 
sauce pan over it, or allow any of the scrapings to fall into it. 
Scraping or stirring the candy while cooling will cause it to become 
sugary. Acid substances, as cream of tartar, vinegar or lemon 
juice, added to the candy while cooking, will help to keep it clear. 

Barley Candy 

1 cup granulated sugar i cup water 

I teaspoonful cream of tartar, or 1 teaspoonful lemon juice or vinegar 

Mix ingredients together before heating. Cook, without stir- 
ring, until a few drops put into cold water will harden. Boil 
until the syrup begins to turn light yellow ; remove at once from 
fire, and turn into a buttered pan. When nearly cool, mark in 
squares with a slightly warmed and buttered chopping knife. 
The candy may be cooled in round muffin pans. 

This candy is used to cover nuts, etc., which are then called 
glace nuts. As soon as candy begins to change color, remove 
sauce pan from the fire: dip 1 or 2 nuts at a time into the 
syrup, disturbing the candy as little as possible. As the syrup 
cools, it may be reheated once or twice, but is liable to burn after 
the second time

Syrup for Snowballs 

2 cups molasses 2 tablespoonfuls butter 

i cup sugar 

Cook together until it is brittle when tested in cold water. 

Pour over popcorn shaped into balls. To use for candy add | 

teaspoonful of cooking soda before pouring into the pans. 

When slightly cool, pull until light colored, and cut into pieces. 

Cocoanut Drops 

^ cup sugar 1 cup grated cocoanut 

i cup molasses 

Cook sugar, molasses and cocoanut together, stirring constantly 

until a little of the mixture will harden in cold water. Remove 

from fire, and stir until it thickens; drop by the spoonful on 

buttered pan and cool. 

Peanut Candy 

J cup chopped peanuts, or left 2 cups granulated sugar 

whole, as preferred 

Remove the skin from the shelled peanuts; chop or roll the 

nuts fine, and warm them in a dish placed on the back of the stove. 

Have ready a tin sheet or an inverted baking pan, slightly warmed 

to keep candy from cooling too quickly. Melt the sugar in an 

agate or iron sauce pan, stirring constantly, to prevent burning. 

When melted to a clear, Hght syrup, stir in the chopped peanuts, 

and turn at once on to the pan, which need not be buttered. 

Shape as nearly square as possible, and mark into squares before 

the candy cools. 

Horehound Candy

2 cups brown sugar i cup butter 

juice of i lemon, or 1 tablespoon- 2 tablespoonfuls water

into squares while warm. Half cup of chopped nuts may be 
added. 

Chocolate Mints 

whites of 2 eggs 6 drops oil of peppermint or 15 

2 tablespoonfuls rich cream drops of essence of pepper- 

2 pounds (about) xxxx con- mint 
fectioners sugar 

Beat the whites of the eggs, not too stiff, add peppermint, 
beat in gradually about a cup of sugar, then alternate the cream 
and sugar, not letting it get either thin or very stiff until all the 
cream is used, and then stiffen with sugar until hard enough to 
mold into discs. Lay these on oiled paper for about an hour. 
Melt unsweetened chocolate and with two forks dip the discs 
quickly into the chocolate and lay on the oiled paper until dry. 
These cannot be kept long as the cream sours. 

Cream Candies 
Make same as chocolate mints substituting any desired flavor- 
ing, vanilla or fresh fruit juices, instead of the peppermint; form 
into balls, and when sufficiently hardened dip into unsweetened 
chocolate. Chopped nuts or fruit added to the cream before 
molding make a pleasing variety.

FREEZING 

Salt and ice make a freezing mixture several degrees colder 
than ice alone. Solids changing to liquids absorb heat from 
surrounding bodies. As the ice changes to liquid (water) it ab- 
sorbs heat. Salt has a strong attraction for water, and makes 
the ice melt more quickly ; the salt also changes to a liquid, ab- 
sorbing still more heat. This heat is taken by the ice and salt 
from the mixture which is to be frozen, around which they are 
closely packed. The smaller the pieces of ice the more quickly 
they change to liquid, and the more salt used the more quickly 
is the mixture frozen, but if too much salt is used the frozen mix- 
ture will be coarse-grained. Experience has shown that the best 
proportion to use is two parts chopped ice and one part rock salt. 

As liquids expand in freezing, the can of the freezer should 
never be more than three-quarters full. If too full the cover 
may be pushed up, allowing the salt water to get in. 

Directions for Freezing 

Place the can of the freezer in the proper position in the pail ; 
put in the dasher, and pour in the mixture to be frozen. Cover 
and adjust the handle so that it turns freely. Surround the can 
with alternate layers of ice and salt in the proportion given, be- 
ginning with the ice. As the ice and salt melt, more should be 
added to keep the freezer full. Turn steadily until the mixture 
becomes so stiff that turning is difficult. Wipe the cover so that 
when it is removed no salt water can drop into the can. Take 
out the dasher, and with a long-handled spoon pack the frozen 



FKEEZING 149 

mixture solidly. Replace the cover, putting a cork in the open- 
ing. Cover the freezer with a thick cloth, and set aside in a cool 
place. 

If not wanted for some time after making, the ^^ cream" or 
^'ice" may be packed or molded. In this case the water should 
be drained off, and the mold or can should be repacked solidly 
in ice and salt, and be well covered in a cool place until wanted.

Sweet Pickled Peaches 

1 pint cider vinegar i ounce cinnamon 

10 pounds of peaches I teaspoonful of mace 

4 pounds of sugar 

Wash and rub the peaches, and stick them with cloves, about 
8 to each peach. Make a syrup of vinegar, sugar and spices. 
Let boil for 3 minutes. Put in as much fruit as this will cover, 
and boil gently until tender, but not soft. Remove from kettle, 
and continue until all the fruit is used. Pour back from the jar 
all the syrup which has drained from the fruit and boil until it 
thickens. Pour over the fruit, and seal the jars. Fruit may be 
pared or not. 

Cherries, Bottled, for Winter Use 

Fill the bottles with good Morello cherries, without stems. 
Stand the bottles in water, and let it boil until the juice is up to 
the neck of the bottles ; then take them out, cork them tight, 
and cover the corks with sealing wax. 

Sweet Pickled Cherries 

To pickle cherries with stalk and stone, cut the stalk to any 
length you like, prick with a needle 2 or 3 times. Boil 1 quart of 
sharp vinegar, with 3 pounds of sugar, skim it and pour while hot 
over 7 pounds of fruit, ounce each of cinnamon, cloves and 
allspice; tied in cheese-cloth bag. Let it remain 24 hours. The 
next day pour off the syrup, boil it again, and put back on the 
fruit, and stand another 24 hours, after which boil the whole, first 
scalding the syrup. When cold, put in jars, cover with the syrup, 
and seal. Damsons, plums and peaches may be pickled in the

5 pounds granulated sugar ^ ounce cinnamon 

1 pint strong vinegar ^ ounce cloves 

Put in the kettle alternate layers of fruit and sugar, heat 
slowly to a boil, add vinegar and spices, put in a bag. Boil 5 
minutes, take out fruit with perforated skimmer, spread on 
dishes to cool. Boil syrup thick. Pack fruit in jars and pour 
syrup on, boiling hot, and seal. Put spices in a bag and leave in 
syrup until spiced enough to taste. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickle. 

Wipe the cucumbers well after taking out of brine; letting 
them soak a few days in fresh water, wipe dry, and cut in lengths 
or rings. Green them over the fire in weak vinegar, with grape 
leaves, as with other pickle; put a small piece of alum in while 
greening. Then take 7 pounds of cucumbers, 1 quart vinegar, 
2i pounds sugar, a little cinnamon, mace, pepper and plenty of 
celery seed. Boil the syrup, and pour over the cucumbers, 
three mornings in succession; the third and last time put the 
pickle in and let it boil a few minutes. With this receipt cucum- 
bers can be used any time during the year. When fresh cucum- 
bers are used, it is necessary to put them in weak salt water 24 
hours before following the above. Black or red pepper can be 
used.
