INTRODUCTION 

In nearly every household there are certain dishes or, at 
any rate, one dish, on the excellence or the originality of 
which the family pride themselves. You know that when 
you stay with the Browns they give you a delicious fish soup 
that you cannot get anywhere else, while Mrs. Black makes 
a wonderful omelette the recipe for which is a family secret ; 
and whenever you lunch at the Whites you never fail to ask 
for the special sauce which their old colored cook and no- 
body else can make. In fact, it has long been realized that 
the ideal Cook-book would be one in which all these special 
dishes could be got together; supposing, of course, that the 
housekeepers and cooks could be persuaded to reveal their 
treasured secrets. 

This volume is an attempt in this direction, and we believe 
the first book of its kind. It is not in any sense of the word 
a text book on cookery; it is meant for the housewife who 
knows how to cook. 

The recipes were gathered by a trained nurse (who also 
had a taste for cooking) as she went from patient to patient 
to exercise her profession. In every house which prided 
itself on a special pudding or a new salad, she jotted down 
in her note-book all the particulars she could get, and thus 
gradually was built up what the authors believe will be a 
treasure-trove to the housewife who wants something a little 
different with which to surprise or please her family and 
friends. 

You will look in vain here for the common boiled potato, 



iv INTRODUCTIOlV 

the poached egg on toast, or roast beef medium, but you 
will find here a number of peculiarly tempting sandwiches, 
delicious salads and puddings, and innumerable attractive 
odds and ends in the way of canapes, cheese dishes, fancy 
breads, pickles, and sauces. 

It offers, in fact, a refuge from the commonplace, and 
will save many an hour of worry for a woman at her wits' 
end for a new idea for the table. 



EXPLANATORY NOTE 



1 



These Recipes are arranged Encyclopaedia fashion so 
that no index is necessary. 

If you have apples in the house, for instance, and wish 
to know at a glance the various ways to use them sug- 
gested by this book, see Apples under A, and you will be 
referred to the various places where apple recipes occur. 

Blank pages are inserted with regular subject headings 
for the convenience of the housewife who wishes to pre- 
serve family recipes under the various heads in this con- 
venient fashion; but readers are advised to write their 
recipes on these pages and not to paste on clippings, as the 
moisture may stain the page, and in time the added bulk 
will strain the binding of the volume.
