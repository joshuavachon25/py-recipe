PREFACE. 



jyiHE extent to which French terms have been intro- 
' duced into cookery and, consequently, into the bills 
of fare of even ordinary restaurants, renders a knowl- 
edge of the meaning of such words absolutely indis- 
Ijensable to every well-bred person, as well as to those 
housekeepers who occasionally find it necessary to re- 
fer to what are called "cook-books." Nothing is more 
embarrassing than to sit down to table with company 
in a restaurant and find one's self ignorant of the mean- 
ing of the names of the viirious dishes that are on the 
bill of fare. Unfortunately, the French employed by 
cooks and caterers is not always that of the "Academie 
Frangaise," and one may look in vain in some of the 
lai-ger French dictionaries for the cook's meaning of 
many words (" saute," for example), though amongst 
those who are familiar with French dishes, these terms 
are well understood. 

It is not every cook who can jabber French that can 
select the names appropriate to the several dishes 
which he prepares, and sometimes they get terribly 
mixed, as every one who has been obliged to frequent 
provincial restaurants knows. One there meets dishes 
which, although very excellent in themselves, would 
never be recognized by the names under which they 
masquerade. Nor is this to be wondered at when we 
recollect that even the " Professors of Heidelberg Uni- 
versity who aided in the preparation of a recent 
English, French, German auri Italian " I'hrase Book '

seem to have been unable to give the English equiva- 
lents for certain well-known French jookery terms 
Thus, aemoide is given as the English for the French 
word "semoule," and for '' puree de pois au croutons" 
they could find no English better than j^iiree de pois aux 
croutons It is needless to say that " peas soup with 
sippets of bread" is a common English dish with a 
very good English name. In another glossary "potages 
aux croutons " is translated soup uith bread. One may 
have soup v:ith bread and yet not have •' potages aux 
croutons." 

Under each important word we have given all the 
phrases in which that word occurs, while at the same 
time we have endeavored to avoid the great expansion 
which would result from duplicating the same phrase 
under the several minor words of which it consists. 
Such expansion would defeat the chief object of the 
book by making it cumbersome and complicated. And 
as many of these phrases are idiomatic, the reader 
would hardly be able to make Ihem out by merely 
translating each individual word. As those who have 
^ad any experience in this direction well know, begin- 
ners who depend upon dictionaries alone run the risk 
of making very queer translations, as was the case with 
the French chef who endeavored to present his menu 
in English and after much labor gave the following 
literal rendering of the name of a well-known dish (ria 
de veau a la financiere): "The laugh of the calf to the 
female capitalist ! " Each word is literally translated, 
but the result is most comically nonsensical. We trust 
that those who consult our little Dictionary will be en- 
abled to avoid such pitfall-. 

It is true that there are certain terms of which it is 
difficult to give an intelligent translation. These are 
chiefiy fancy names adopted by individual cooks, and 



having a merely local siguiflcance and ephemeral ut>e. 
Dishes "a la Princess," "a la Victoria," etc., depend 
for their characteristics upon the individual ideas of 
the chef who adopts the names which distinguish them. 

Another source of confusion arises from the fact that 
the English names of birds, etc., are often applied in 
this country to animals which are very different from 
those originally so called. Perhaps the most striking 
as well as the most familiar instance of this is the case 
of the robin. The European robin tronrie-rjorne in 
French) is a small bird, less than the sparrow ; the 
American robin is a much larger bird, and is frequently 
served at table. It is, in fact, a true thrush {Ttirdus vti- 
gratorius). Another instance is seen in the use of the 
name "pheasant" {/aisan). The true pheasant is not 
found in this country ; but the ruffed grouse is often 
called "pheasant" in some parts of the United States. 
The same thing occurs amongst the fishes. Our pike is 
not the French brocket. 

We have not attempted to give any instructions con- 
cerning either the grammar or the pronunciation of 
the language for the simple reason that such con- 
densed rules and notes as we could embody in a boolc 
of this size would be of no practical use. But from the 
fact that the rules for the gender of nouns are, in 
French, exceedingly complex, and, further, that arti- 
cles, adjectives and participles must agree in number 
and gender with the nouns to which they relate, we 
have in the Dictionary given the gender, etc., of all the 
nouns, the masculine and feminine forms of the adjec- 
tives, etc. Appended to each word will be found an 
English form for pronouncing it. This we have adapt- 
ed from Nugent as being the most easily followed. 

But it should be remembered that to speak a 
language is one thing, and to understand written or 



printed expressions in that language is quite another. 
The reader will find no difficulty in understanding and 
reiueinbering the phrases here given, even though he 
should never be able to speak a word of French; and if 
he should attempt the latter feat, he would at least be 
saved from making himself ridiculous by uttering such 
onlers as " Cafe- au lait without any milk"— an order 
which we actually heard given on one occasion to a 
French waiter ! ! We noticed the faint smile which 
overspread the face of the garden, though with the 
innate politeness of his race he tried to conceal his 
mirth, brought a large cup of coffee without milk, and 
bowed politely for his " pour boire."

* The common e.xpression, "oysters on the half

two shells, and it is usually served on one, or, in other 

words, it is served on the single shell or simply " on a 

shell," as the French have it. No one ever saw oysters 

served on half shells; it wou d be almost impossible to 

serve them thus. That each valve of the oyster-cover 

is properly a shell can scarcely be disputed. Jt is so in 

coTnmon language, and in the article on "Mollusca,' 

contributed to The Encyclopedia Britanni<\'i by Dr. E.
