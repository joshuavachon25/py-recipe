THE 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE'S GUIDE. 



CHAPTER I. 



* ON THE CHOICE OF MEATS. 

Beef. When it is young, it will have a fine 
smooth open grain, be a good red, and feel tend- 
er. The fat should be white, rather than yellow ; 
when that is of a deep eolour, the meat is seldom 
good. When fed with oil cakes, it is usually so, 
and the flesh is flabby. 

Pork. If the rind is tough and thick, it is old. 
A thin rind is always preferable. When fresh," 
the meat will be smooth and cool ; if clammy, it 
is tainted. 

Mutton. Choose this by its fine grain, good 
colour, and white fat. 

Lamb. If it has a green or yellow cast, it is 
stale. 

Veal. The whitest is the most juicy, and 
therefore preferable. 

Bacoy . If the rind is thin, the fat firm, -^nd 
of a reel tinge, the lean of a good colour and adher- 
ing to the bone, it is good, and not old. 

Hams. Stick a sharp knife under the bone, if 
it comes out clean with a i)leasant smell, it is 
good ; but if the knife is daubed and has a bad 
;^fent; do not buy it,

ON THE CHOICE OF FOWLS. 

Turkeys, If young, the legs will be black 
and smooth, the eyes lively, and the feet pliable* 
If old, the eyes will be sunk and the feet dry. 

Geese. If young, the bill will be yellow, and 
the feet limber. If old, the bill and feet will be 
red and dry. 

Hens. If their comb and legs are rough, tliey 
are old ; if smooth and limber, they are young. 

Wild and Tame Ducks, If young, they will 
be limber-footed ; if old, hard and thick on the 
lower part of the body. A wild duck has red 
feet, and smaller than tame ones. 

Partridges, If young, will have a black bill 
and yellow legs ; if old, the bill will be white and 
the legs blue. Old fowls, tame and wild, may b© 
told by their hard, rough, or dry feet. 

Hares and Rabbits, If young, they will be 
white and stiff, the ears will tear like brown paper. 
If old, the flesh will bo dark, the body limber,, 
and the ears tough. A rabbit, if old, will be 
dark, the body limber, and the ears tough. A 
rabbit, if old, will be limber and flimsy ; if young, 
white and stiff*. 

ON THE CHOICE OF FISH. 

Cod, The gills should be very red, the fish 
thick at the neck, the flesh white and firm, and 
the eyes fresh. When flabby, they are not good. 

Salmon. If new, the flesh is cf a fine red, the 
gills particularly, the scales bright, and the whole 
fish stiff. 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



Shcdy if good, are white and thick ; g'?ls red, 
and eyes bright, the fish stiff and firm. Season, 
May and June. 

Mackerel, Their season is May, June, and 
July. Being very tender, they do not carry or 
keep as well as other fish unsalted. 

Striped Bass. If the eyes are sunken, and 
gills pale, they hav e been fi^om the water too long. 
Their fineness depends upon being cooked imme- 
diately after they are killed. 

Trout These should be killed and dressed 
as soon as caught. When you buy them, see that 
the gills are red, and hard to open; the eyes 
bright, and the body stiff". The season, July, 
August, and September. 

Flounders soon become flabby and bad ; they 
should be thick and firm, the eyes bright. 

Lobsters, If they have not been too long taken, 
the claws will have a strong motion if you press 
your finger on the eyes. The heaviest are the 
best. The male, though generally smaller, has 
the highest flavour, the firmest flesh, and the deep- 
est red. It may be known from the female by 
having a narrow tail. 

Crabs, Those of middling size are the sweet- 
est. The heaviest are best. When in perfection^ 
the joints of the legs are stiff", and the body has 
an agreeable smell. The eyes look loose and dead 
when stale. 

All fish should be well dressed and clean, as 
nothing is more unpalatable than fresh fish not 
thoroughly cooked. 



4 SKILFUL housewife's GUIDE. 

Fresh Fish, when boiled, should be placed m 
cold, and shell-fish in boiling water. 

Fish should be garnished with parsley, or hard 
boiled eggs cut in ring3> and laid around the 
dish. 

To keep Outers, 

* After washing them, lay them in a tub, with 
the deep part of the shell undermost, sprinkle 
them with salt and Indian meal, or flour, and fill 
the tub with cold water, and set it in a cool 
place. Change the water daily, and they will 
keep fresh a fortnight. 

Rules and Suggestions. 

If meat or fish has acquired a slightly unpleasant 
flavor, or does not smell perfectly fresh, when pre- 
pared to boil, add a tea-spoonful of saleratus, and, 
unless it is bad, it will remove every thing un- 
pleasant in taste and smell. If the brine of meat 
or fish begins to have an unpleasant smell, scald 
and sldm it, adding to it a spoonful or two of 
saleratus, pepper and cinnamon, or throw it away 
and make new with the above ingredients. 

Baking meats is easily done, and is a nice way 
of dressing a dinner, but a loan thin piece should 
never be used in this manner, it will all shrivel 
away. 

The most economical way of cooking fresh meat, 
is to boil it, if the lic^uid is used, as it always may 
be, for soups or broths. 

It takes fat mcut L 12:01' than lean to bake. All 



SKII^FUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE.

fresh meat should be kept awhiie to make it tender. 

In baking any kind of meats or puddings, if a 
stove is used, they will bear more fire at jfirst than 
when they are nearly done. 

In cooking by afire-place, cooks impose on them- 
selves discomfort, and incur a great waste in fiiel, 
by making too much fire. Often, in summer, a 
fire is made like a small furnace to boil a pot. 
Three small sticks of wood, or two, with chips, 
are sufficient at a time, if the pot or kettle is hung 
l©w, and but little inconvenience is felt from the 
fire. If you use a tin baker, the upper part or lid 
is sufficient to bake meats of almost any kind, if 
bright. Mutton, veal, pork, beef, &c. have been 
well cooked in this simple way. Set the dripping 
pan on a few coals, with a small quantity of water, 
with merely the cover over it, and it will be done 
in the same time with less fire, less trouble, and no 
drawing out of smoke. Puddings may be done 
in the same way, and al^o custards. 

When a pig is baked, a nice crisp may be given 
by rubbing it over well with butter. It is better 
than oil, on account of the salt. 

REGULATION OF TIME IN COOKING. 

Boiling. . . ' • . 

The first caution is, that whatever is used for 
boiling must be perfectly clean. The second, keep 
it constantly boiling. Salt meat may be put into 
cold, and fresh into hot water. If a scum rises 
iipon the surface, it must be skimmed off, or it will 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



discolour the meat. Never crowd the pot with 
meat, but leave room for plenty of water. Allow 
a quarter of an hour for every pound of meat. An 
old fowl will need boiling three or four hours. A 
grown one an hour and a half. A pullet an hour. 
A chicken about half an hour. 

Boasting, 

Beef, A large roasting piece will bake in four 
hours, a smaller one in three or three and a half. 

Mutton, A leg, or saddle, will require two 
hours and a half each. A shoulder, loin, neck, 
and heart, will each need an hour and a half or 
three quarters. 

VeaL A fillet, which is the thick part of the 
hind quarter, will require four or five hours. A 
loin, or shoulder, from three to three and a half. 
A neck, or breast, nearly two hours. 

Lamb, A hind-quarter of lamb, is generally 
cooked whole, and requires nearly two hours. A 
fore-quarter, two hours. • A leg nearly an hour 
and a half. A shoulder and breast, one hour. 

Pork. A leg will require nearly three hours, 
A thick spare-rib, two hours or more ; a thin one, 
an hour and a quarter or half. A loin will bake 
in two hours or more. A pig, three or four weeks 
old, will require but about an hour and a half. 

Venison, A large haunch, will require four 
hours and a half; a smaller one, about three hours^ 

Poultry, 

Turkey, The largest size will require three 
hours ; a smaller one, two liours ; the least size, 
one hour and a half,

Goose. A full grown goose will requ: a nearly 
two hours ; but a young one will roast in an hour. 

Duck, The largest will bake in less than an 
hour ; the smaller ones in half an hour. Pricking 
with a fork will determine you, whether done or 
not. Fowls should be well done through, and all 
meats but beef; this is generally preferred rare 
done.

COOKING FISH, SOUPS, MEATS, &c. ^ 

Baked Shad* 

In the first place make a stuffing of the head and 
cold boiled ham, seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, 
and sweet marjoram, moisten it with beaten yolk 
of an egg. Stuff the fish, rub the outside with the 
yolk of egg, and some of the stuffing. Lay the 
fish in a deep pan, putting its tail to its mouth. 
Pour in the pan a little water, a piece of butter 
rolled in flour. Bake two hours, pour the gravy 
round it, garnish with lemon, sliced, and send to 
table. Any fish may be baked in this way. 

To hroil Shad and other Fish, 

Split, wash, and dry in a cloth. Season with 
salt and pepper. Grease the gridiron, lay the 
fish, the outside uppermost, over coals, and broil 
a quarter of an hour or more. Butter it well, 
season with pepper and salt ; send to table hot. 



8 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



Sturgeon Cutlets or Steaks, 

Take off the skin, cut from the tail-piece slicea 
hali' an inch thick, rub them with salt, and broil 
ovef a hot fire. Butter, and sprinkle on them 
Cayenne pepper. Or first dip them in beaten yolk 
of egg and bread crumbs, and wrap them up in 
buttered papers, and broil ov^ r a clear fire. Send 
to the table without the pfipers. 

To boil Fresh Salmon. 

Scale and clean, cutting open no more than is 
necessary. Place it in a kettle of cold water, with 
a handful of salt. Let it boil slowly, but it should 
be well cooked, about a quarter of an hour to a 
pound of fish. Skim it well, and as soon as done, 
lift it carefully into a napkin, to absorb the mois- 
ture, and wrap it close. Send to table on a hot 
dish, garnish with horse-radish and curled parsley, 
or boiled eggs cut in rings, laid round the dish. 
Oyster sauce is best with fresh boiled fish. 

Salmon — English tnode, . 

Families who purchase a whole salmon, and 
like it quite fresh, should parboil the portion not 
required for the day's consumption, and lay it aside 
in the liquor, boiling up the whole together when 
wanted. Bv this means the curd will be set, and 
the fish equally good on the following day. The 
custom of sending up rich sauces, such as lobster, 
is unknown in salmon countries; a little lemon 
pickle or white wine vinegar being quite sufficient, 
added to melted butter. Salmon should be garnish- 
ed with boiled fennel and parsley. It will require 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



:« 



great attention, and the boiling must be checked 
more than once. 

Smoked Salmon, 
Clean and scale, cut the fish up the back, take 
out the roe and the bone neatly. Rub inside and 
out, with equal parts of Havana sugar, add salt, 
and a little saltpetre. Press the fish flat with a 
board and weights on it, two days. Drain from 
the salt, wipe it, and stretch it open, and fasten 
with a pin or stick. Then hang up, and smoke 
over a wood fix^e five or six davs. When used, 
soak the slices in luke-warm water, and broil for 
breakfast. 

Salmon Broiled, 

Cut the salmon into thick dices, dry them in a 
cloth, flour them well, and broil them. This is an 
excellent method anywhere, but is cooked in full 
perfection only on the banks of the lakes of Kil- 
larney, where the salmon is broiled over an arbutus 
fire. 

Lobsters and Crabs, 

Put them in boiling water with a handful of 
salt. Boil half an hour or an hour in proportion 
to the size. If boiled too long, the meat will be 
hard and stringv. When done, wipe dry and take 
off the shell, and take out the blue veins, and what 
is called the lady-fingers, as they are unwholesome 
and not to be eaten. Send it to table cold with 
the body and tail split open, and the claws taken 
off. Lay the largo claws next the body, the small 
ones outside ; garnish with double parsley.

To dress Lobsters cold. 

Take the fish out of the shell, divide it in small 
pieces, mash up the scarlet meat and prepare a 
salad mixture of Cayenne pepper, salt, sweet oil, 
vinegar and mustard ; mix the lobster with this 
preparation together and serve in a dish. 
Stewed Oysters — Ameriean mode. 

They should be only boiled a few minutes. 
Add to them a little water, salt, and a sufficient 
quantity of butter, and pepper, roll crackers fine, 
and stir in. Some prefer toast of nice bread laid 
in the bottom of the dish, with less cracker. 
Either is good. They should be served hot. 

Stewed Oysters, plain. 

Beard the oysters, wash them in cheir own 
liquor, then strain it, thicken it with thin melted 
butter, or white sauce made of cream ; season it 
with a blade of mace and a few whole peppercorns 
tied in a muslin bag. Simmer the oysters very 
gently, and serve up with sippets of bread : they 
will require only a few minutes, and if allowed to 
boil will become hard. 

Scalloped Oysters. 
Beard the oysters, and wash them in their 
liquor, then strain the liquor and pour it over a 
quantity of bread-crumbs. Lay the crumbs into 
scalloj)s of china or tin, and put the oysters in 
layers, with bread-crumbs, pepper, and butter 
between, cover the top with bread-crumbs and 
butter, and bake them in an oven or before the 
fire. 






SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE 8 GUIDE,

Oysters in Scallop- Shells. 

Keep the oysters in their liquor : put a bit of 
butter in a stewpan, with minced parsley, shalot, 
and a little pepper ; brown them, dusting in a 
little flour, then add the oyster-liquor, strained, 
and a little good gravy, work them until they are 
of the consistence of sauce ; then toss and put in 
the oysters, add lemon-juice, and fill the scallop- 
shells : strew grated bread-crumbs over the top, 
adding some small pieces of butter, put them into 
a very quick oven, and finish them of a fine brown. 

Oyster Fritters, 

Beard the oysters, dip them into a thick batter, 
made rich with Qg^, or, what is better, into an 
omelette, and then in crumbs of bread, fry them : 
they are an exquisite garnish for fried fish. * 

To fry Oysters, 

Make a batter, wipe the oysters dry, dip them 
in the batter, and roll them in crumbs of bread and 
mace, finely powdered, and fry in butter. 

Oyster Patties. 

Stew some large oysters with a little nutmeg, a 
few cloves, some yolk of ^gg boiled hard, and 
grated, a little butter and as much of the oyster 
liquor as will cover them ; when stewed a few 
moments, take them out of the pan to cool. Have 
shells of puff paste previously baked in small patfcy 
pans, and lay two or three oysters in each.

twice its quantity of boiled potatoes, knead all 
well together, make in small cakes and fry in but- 
ter. If, after having boiled codfish, you have 
some left, use it in the same way. It makes a 
nice and wholesome dish. 

Boiled Cod* 

The finest portion of the cod, the head and 
shoulders and the middle, are not supposed to re- 
quire foreign aid or sophistication to fit them for the 
table, but may be sent up simply boiled, with 
oyster-sauce; the tail may be boned, cut into 
pieces, floured and fried, or stewed. Cod is occa- 
sionally cut into slices, and fried or broiled. 

Cod's Head and Ouster Sauce. 

' Brown a bit of butter in a stewpan, dust it with 
flour to thicken the sauce; pour in some beef-soup, 
mince in an onion or two, and let the whole boil a 
little ; take half a hundred of oysters, or a quart of 
pickle.I mussels, with a considerable quantity of 
their iiq^ior, stew altogether till quite ready, taking 
care to season the sauce with salt and pepper ; 
meantime boil the cod in water, with a little salt. 
Serve in a deep dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

Cod^s Head and Shoulders 

Will eat much finer by having a little salt rubbed 
down the bone, and along the thick part, even if it 
be eaten the same day. Great care must be taken 
to serve it without the smallest speck of black or 
scum. Garnish with ^ large quantity of doublo 
paroley, lemony horse-radish, and the milt, roe, and

liver, and fried smelts, if approved. If with smelts, 
be careful that no water hangs about the fish, or 
the beauty of the smeUs will I be taken oiT, as. well 
as their flavour. Serve with plenty of oyster or 
shrimp sauce, and anchovy-butter. When pro- 
perly prepared, lay the fish on a tin fishplate, and 
covfer the whole with a cloth. Put it into cold 
hard water, with two handsful of salt, and two 
table-spoonsful of vinegar ; let it heat gradually un- 
til it boils, then take it quite off the fire, and keep it 
closely covered in the water for an liour, near, but 
not on the fire, scarcely being allowed to simmer. 

Stewed Cod. • ■ ^ 

Cut the cod into slices, season them with pepper 
and salt, put them into a stewpan with half a pint 
of water, and some good gravy. After stewing a 
few minutes, add half a pint of wine, the juice of 
half a lemon, a dozen or two of oysters with their 
liquor, a piece of butter, rolled in flour, and two 
or three blades of mace. When the fish is 
sufficiently stewed, which will be in a quarter of 
an hour, serve it up with the sauce. Any kind of 
fish-sauce may be substituted for the wine, and a 
Variety offered by employing anchovies instead of 
oysters. 

To boil Fresh Codjish — American mode. 

Put it in when the water is boiling hot, and 
boil it twenty or thirty minutes, according to the 
size of the fish. Use melted butter or ovster sauce 
for gravy.

. ' ' To boil Salt Codfish, " 

Lay it in water over night to soak. Then put 
it in water to cook, and when the water, becomes 
scalding hot, let it remain in that scalding state 
two or three hours. There should be but little 
water used ; and not boiled at all. that it may not 
grow hard. For gravy, use drawn butter or egg 
sauce. 

To dress Salt Fish that has been boiled ; an excel- 
lent dish. 
Break it into flakes, and put it into a pan with 
sauce thus made : beat boiled parsnips in a mor- 
tar, then add to it a cup of cream, and a good piece 
of butter rolled in flour, a little white pepper, and 
half a tea-spoonful of mustard, all boiled together; 
keep the fish no longer on the fire than to become 
hot, but not to boil. 

Codfish Toast. 
Shred it in fine pieces, and soak it in cold water 
mitil suflSciently fresh, then drain it well, and stir 
into it u table spoonful of flour, half a tea-cupful 
of sweet cream, and two thirds of a tea-cup of 
milk, and one egg if convenient. Season it well 
with pepper, and let it scald slowly, stirring it well. 
Make a nice moist toast, well seasoned, and lay it 
on the platter, with the fish over it, and it is ready 
for the table, and is a fine di^h. Made as above, 
without toast, it is also good ; with vegetables, 
butter may be used instead oi' cream.

water is well drained, have a piece of butter as 
large as an egg, melted and hot. Stir into the 
fish a spoonful of flour to abrorb all the water, and 
then lay into the butter, stirring it well about five 
minutes, then lay it upon the platter, pepper, and 
send it up. Some prefer this to any other mode 
of preparation. 

To cook fresh Fish or Eels, 

The fish should not be laid in until the fat is hot. 
Beat up an egg or t^vo, and with a pastry brush 
lay it on the fish, shake crumbs of bread and flour 
mixed, over the fish, and fry them a light brown, 
turn them once and take care they du not break. 
A more common method is, to fry them after salt 
pork, dipping them in Indian meal or flour. Lay 
the skin uppermost to prevent its breaking. 
Soaking fresh fish or fresh meat in water is injuri- 
ous ; after they are well ressed, they should be 
kept dry in a cool place, and if necessary, salted. 

Eel — English mode. 
Clean the eel well, and cut it into pieces, leaving 
it in water ; put them into a stewpan with butter, 
sot them for a minute on the fire ; then dust flour ; 
add some gravy, and stir it witli a wooden spoon 
until it boils ; add parsley, shalot, half a bay leaf, 
a clove, salt, }>epper, and small onions ; simmer all 
together, and reduce. Take oft' the fat, remove 
the herbs, and thicken with the yolks (;f eggs add- 
ing the juice of a lemon : or, after half boiling the 
eels with the herbs, they may be rolled in yolks of 
eggs, dipped in minced ])jir3ley and crumbs of 
hread, and boiled until brown.

Eels Spitchcocked, 

Bruise together a small quantity of cloves, mace, 
nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and rub it over the fish, 
either cut in lengths or rolled round ; put it into 
a stewpan with half a pint of cider, a cupful of 
good gravy, one anchovy, a glass of port wine, a 
whole onion, some scraped horse-radish, a bunch of 
fiweet herbs, and a little lemon-peel : when suffici- 
ently stewed, strain tlie sauce, and thicken it with 
a little butter or cream. A good thickening may 
be made by melting a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, rolled in half a tea-spoonful of flour in a 
little milk. 

. . To stew Eels. 

\ Cut the eels in pieces, fry them a little until they 
are a fine brown ; let them remain until cold ; take 
an onion, a little parsley, a leaf of sage chopped 
very finely ; put them in some gravy, with a clove, 
a blade of mace, pepper, and salt. Stew the eels 
until they are tender ; then add a glass of port 
wine, and a little lemon-juice, after straining the 
sauce and thickening it with butter and flour. 

Cod Sounds and Tongues* 

Make a batter of eggs and flour, or beat one 
egg, and dip them in the eg^, and then in the 
flour, and fry in butter, or boil them twenty min- 
utesj and use drawn butter gravy. 

Herrings, 
This fish is usually broiled, but they are some- 
times boiled. When thus dressed, rub them over 
with salt and vinegar, skewer them with their tiila

in their mouths, lay them on a fish-plate, and boil 
them for ten minutes in boiling water. Drain them 
thoroughly, and lay them round a dish with the 
heads in the centre ; garnish with boiled parsley, 
and serve up with a good sauce. Herrings should 
be broiled over a good fire : they will be improved 
by being sprinkled with salt and pressed, and then 
washed in vinegar : if kept more than a day, they 
should be covered with salt. 



Herrings and Onions, 






Notwithstanding the prejudice against the union 
of two such strongly-flavoured viands, the following 
method of dressing herrings has been so highly 
recommended, that it is given upon the authority 
of a very celebrated gastronome : — Shred the 
onions finely and fry them, clean fresh herrings, 
fry them also, and serve them in the dish with the 
onions. 

To make a Chowder, ,.. 

Lay four or five slices of salt pork in the bottom 
of the pot, let it cook slowly that it may not burn ; 
when done brown, take it out, and lay in fish cut 
in length- wise slices, then a layer of crackers, sliced 
onions, find very thin sliced potatoes, with some of the 
pork that was fried, and then a layer of fish again, 
und so on. Strew a little salt and pepper over 
each layer ; over the whole, pour a bowl full of 
flour and water well stirred up, enough to come 
up even with what you have in the pot. A sliced 
lemon adds to the flavour. A few clams im-

prove it. Let it be so covered that the steam can- 
not escape. It must not be opened until cooked, 
to see if it is well seasoned. 

For broiling Chickens, 

Separate the breast from the back, beat them 
flat as you would steak, lay the under side to the 
fire until it is above half done. Cover them over 
with a square tin, or other convenient covering, 
and they will be done through much sooner. 
Great care should be taken not to let the flesh 
side burn,but they should be of a fine brown colour. 
When the difierent parts of the chicken are done, 
turn over them some melted butter, with a little 
salt and and pepper. 

To fricasee a Chicken, 

Cut it in pieces, jointing it well, and boi) it 
tender with a slice or two of pork cut fine. 
When nearly done, add half a tea-spoonful of 
pepper and salt to just season it. When tender, 
turn ofl" the water and add half a pound of butter 
or nearly that, and let it fry a while. Then take 
out the chicken, and stir in two or three spoonsful 
of flour previously dissolved in cold water, and 
add the water from the chicken. Let it boil, 
and pour it upon the chicken on the platter. 
This makes a superior dish, and needs no vegeta- 
bles but mashed potatoes. 

Chickens Boiled. 

The wings and legs of fowls should be fastened

pared, let them lie in skim-milk two hours. 
Then put them in cold water, cover them, and 
boil over a slow fire. Skim the water clean. 
Serve with white sauce, or drawn butter. 

' Chicken Pie. 

Boil the chickens tender or nearly so, having 
them cut in pieces. Make a rich crust, adding a 
little saleratus, and an egg or two, to make it light 
and puff. Lay it around the sides of the pan, and 
then lay in the chickens ; between each layer, 
sprinkle in flour, pepper, salt, and butter, with a 
thin slice of paste here and there. Then add the 
water in which they were boiled, and cover them. 
They should be baked an hour or an hour and a 
half, according to the size of the pie. 

To roast Geese and Ducks, 

See to it that they are well dressed, and then 
boil them an hour or more, according to their age. 
When they begin to feel tender, take them out, 
and having your stufling prepared of bread, salt, 
pepper, and butter, some like sage, made soft ; fill 
the body and fasten it up with thread. Roast 
them brown. Make your gravy of the dripping ; 
serve both with apple sauce. Poultry, when roasted 
or boiled, should have the wings and legs fastened 
close to the body with a cord tied around.

and stew until done, and lay them in a dish, and 
pour the gravy over them. 

Mock Duck. 

Take a steak about as large as a breakfast 
plate, beat it out, and fill it with a bread stuffing 
prepared as for a turkey, and sew it up. Fry one 
hour in the dripping from roast beef or butter. 
Turn it and keep it covered until near done. 
When you take it up, turn in half a cup of hot 
water in the gravy that has been previously 
seasoned, and pour over. It will be thickened 
with the stuffing that falls from it. 

To cook Pigeons, 

After they are well dressed, put a slice of salt 
pork and a little ball of stuffing into the body of 
each. Flour the pigeons well, and lay them close 
in the bottom of the pot. Just cover them with 
water, and throw in a piece of butter, and let them 
stew an hour and a quarter, if young ; if old, longer. 
This is preferred to roasting, or any other way 
they can be prepared. They may be cooked in 
the same way without stuffing.

To roast a Turhey. 

Prepare the stuffing with bread, salt, pepper, 
butter, cinnamon or nutmeg, or a little lemon 
peel, or parsley and thyme, chop and mix all well 
together with one or two eggs beat well. With 
this dressing stuff the body and the breast, and 
sew them with a strong thread. Roast the turkey 
of a fine brown, not burning it. It will be well 
done in one hour and a half, or if old and very 
large, two hours or more. Make a gravy of 
drawn butter and the dripping. Another sauce 
is made of half a pint of oysters boiled in a pan, 
thickened with a lump of butter rolled in flour. 
Only let it boil once. Serve this by itself, in con- 
nection with other gravy, for every person does 
not like oyster sauce. 

To broil a Steak. ' '■ 

Pound it well, striking it with the edge to cut 
the fibres ; when sufficiently thin and tender, lay 
it upon the gri^ron and cook it over hot coals, 
turning it often ; when the blood settles upon tha 
top, hold the platter near and take it carefully on 
that it may not be lost ; let the steak lie upon the 
platter until every thing is in readiness, though 
not over a minute, then lay it back on a few fresh 
coals until done. Have butter melted, and when 
the steak is on the platter, pepper and salt it, and 
pour over the butter, and take it on hot. The 
meat should not be pressed to obtain the blood, it 
makes the meat dry, and greatly impairs its rich- 
pess. It should not be commenced until every-^ 
thing is ready. It requires constant attention.

Ham Sandwiches, 

Slightly spread thin slices of bread ; if you 
choose, spread on a very little mustard. Lay 
very thin slices of boiled ham between ; tongue, 
sliced or grated, may be used instead. Lay them 
on plates, to be used at suppers. 

To boil a Ham, 

Soak according to its age twelve or twenty-four 
hours. Have it more than covered with cold 
water, and let it simmer two or three hours, and 
then boil an hour and a half or two hours ; skim 
it carefully. When done, take it up and skin it 
neatly, dress it with cloves and spots of pepper 
laid on accurately. You may cut writing or 
tissue paper in fringe, and twist around the shank 
bone if you like. It shoula be cut past the centre 
nearest the hock, in very thin slices. 

To broil Ham, 

Cut the pieces in thin slices, soak them in hot 
water fifteen or twenty minutes. Dry them in a 
cloth and lay them on a hot grid^'ron, and broil a 
few moments. Butter and season with a little 
pepper. Cold boiled ham is better to broil than 
raw, and mil require no soaking. If you wish to 
serve fried eggs with it, do it according to the 
directions ; lay on each slice of ham, and send it 
to the table hot. 

To fry a Ham. 

Cut a ham through the middlj, and then you 
get fat and lean in good proportions, lay it in your

pan or spider, and cover it that it may cook tender 
in the steam. When nearly done, let it finish 
open that the steam may evaporate, and that it 
may slightly brown. 

To roast Pork, 

-> 

When you roast that which has the skin on, 
take a sharp knife and cut it through the rind, 
that it may crisp well. If a leg, cut a hole under 
the twist, and stuff it with chopped bread, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, and sage, and skewer it up. 
Roast it crisp and handsomely brown. Make a 
drawn gravy of the dripping, and serve it with 
apple sauce. This is called mock-goose. The 
spare-rib should be sprinkled with flour, and pep- 
per, and a little salt, and turned often, until near- 
ly done ; then let the round side lie up until nice- 
ly brown. Make the gravy of the dripping, pre- 
pared with flour, and seasoned well with salt j 
nevei send it to the table without apple sauce^ 
sallad, or pickles. Pork must be well done. 
To every pound allow a quarter of an hour ; for 
example, twelve pounds will require three hours^ 
If it be a thin piece of that weight, two hours will 
roast it. "^ 

To roast a Pig, 

V/hen well dressed and washed, prepare a stuf^ 
fing of chopped bread, seasoned well with pepper, 
salt, sage and butter, soaked enough to make it 
soft. Fill the body and sew it up with strong 
thread. Flour it well all over, and when the oven 
is wdl heated through^ put it in on dripping pans, 









i;

that will catch all the gravy. Let it stand in two 
or three hours, according to the size of the pig. 
Let it be well crisped and of course handsomely 
brown. When you take it from the oven, mash 
two spoonsful of flour, with butter enough to mix 
well, and dip on the dripping a little at a time at 
first until melted, then pour it on, stirring it un- 
til thickened, season it well with salt, and add to 
it the brains bruised fine, and then send it to the 
table. The head must be cut off and laid upon 
the platter. 

To fry Porh» 

If too salt, freshen by heating it in water after 
it is cut in slices. Then pour oiF the water and 
fry until done. Take out the pork, and stir a 
spoonful of flour into the lard, and turn in milk 
or cream enough to thicken. This makes a more 
delicate gravy u d is very palatable. 



JPork Steak, 



This should be broiled the same as beef, except 
that it requires to be done slower and much longer. 
If there is too much fire, it will blaze. Cut in 
around the bone that there may be nothing that 
has a raw appearance. Season with butter, salt 
and pepper. They may be cooked in cutlets like 
veal, with a little powdered sage and hard crumbs, 
or flour, fried in butter. 

A Pork Stew, 

Take pieces of fresh pork, sweet bread, liver, 
heart, tongue, and skirts. Boil in just water 
enough to cook them tender. Before they are 






SKILFUL HOUSEWIFES GUIDE. 



25 



done, season them with salt and a good deal of 
pepper, and let them fry after the water is out to 
a fine brown. It is an excellent dish. , 

To dress Venison. i 

A haunch of buck will take three hours and a 
half or three-quarters roasting 5 doe, only three hours 
and a quarter. Venison should be rather under 
than over done. 

Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not 
into the dish (unless there is none in the venison), 
and made thus : Cut off the fat from two or three 
pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set in steaks 
on a gridiron for a few minutes, just to brown one 
side ; put them into a saucepan with a quart of 
water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer it 
gently ; then uncover it, and stew till the gravy is 
reduced to a pint. Season with salt only. 

Currant-jelly sauce must be served in a boat. 

If the venison be fresh, merely dry it with a cloth, 
and hang it in an airy place. Should it be necessary 
to keep it for any length of time, rub it all over with 
beaten ginger. If it happen to be musty, wash it, 
firstly, with lukewarm water, and secondly, with 
milk and water, also lukewarm. Then dry it very 
well with clean cloths, and rub it over with powdered 
ginger. Observe the same method with hare. It 
must be looked at every day, and peppered if at- 
tacked by flies. When to be roasted, wash it well in 
luke-warm water, and dry it with a cloth. Cover 
the haunch with buttered paper when spitted for 
roasting, and baste it very well all the time it is at 
the fire. When sufficiently done, take off the paper, 









25 



SKlLtVL HOUSEWIFE*S GUIDE. 



and dredge it very gently with flour in order to froth 
it, but let it be dusted in this manner as quickly as 
possible, lest the fat should melt. Send it up in 
the dish with nothing but its own gravy. Some 
persons add a coarse paste, securing it and the 
paper with packthread : it is then frequently basted, 
and a quarter of an hour before it is removed from 
the fire the paper and paste are taken off, and the 
meat dredged with flour and basted with butter: 
gravy should accompany the venison, in a tureen, 
together with currant-jelly, either sent to table cold, 
or me^^'^d in port wine and served hot. 

Ve\p.,on may be kept by rubbing it over with 
coaisc sugar ; when to be roasted, should it have 
hung vevy long, take off the skin, as this becomes 
musty first, and will, in cooking, impart a disagree- 
able flavour to the whole. Wrap up the venison 
in a veal-caul, and then cover it with paper. 

Haunch of Mutton* 

This being a favourite joint, two or three recipes 
will be f^iven to improve the flavour. It will require 
to be kept for some time, and must therefore be 
well washed with vinegar, wiped every day, and, 
if necessary, rubbed with pounded pepper and 
ginger. Stick two cloves in the knuckle, and 
twenty- four hours before it is put upon the spit, 
having thoroughly .Vied and wiped it clean, lay it in 
a pan, and pour as much port wine over it as will 
serve io soak it, turning it frequently, so that every 
part shall equally imbibe the wine. Stick two 
more cloves in it, paper up the fat, and roast it the 



/ 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE 8 GUIDE. 



27 






same as venison, basting with the wine mixed with 
butter : serve it with gravy and currant-jelly. 

Another way to make a Haunch of Mutton taste 

like Venison. 

Take the skin carefully off, and rub the meat 
with olive oil, then put it into a pan with a quan- 
tity of whole pepper, four cloves of garlic, a bundle 
of sweet herbs, consisting of parsley, thyme, sweet 
marjoram, and a couple of bay leaves. Pour upon 
the meat a pint of good vinegar and three or four 
table-spoonsful of olive oil. Cover the upper sur- 
face of the meat with slices of raw onion, and turn 
the mutton every day, always taking care to put the 
slices of onion on the top surface. At the expira- 
tion of four days, take the meat out, wipe it with a 
napkin, and hang it up in a cool place till the next 
day, when it is fit for roasting. The under part of 
a sirloin of beef, or the half of a beef-heart, may be 
prepared in the same manner, and stuffed and roasted 
like a hare. 

A more simple method is to stick two cloves in 
the haunch, wash it with vinegar which has been 
poured into a basin rubbed with garlic, repeating this 
latter process every day, and let it hang until it is 
tender. 

Saddle of Mutton, 

This joint should be well hung and well roasted ; 
take out the fat from the inside, and remove or re- 
tain the kidneys, as it may be convenient ; split the 
tail, skewer the pieces back in a ring on either side. 
When great pains are taken v/ith the dinner, raise 






28 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



the skin, but skewer it on again, removing it alto- 
gether twenty minutes before the mutton is dished. 
On removing the skin, sprinkle the mutton with salt, 
dredge it with flour, and send it up finely frothed. 

To roast Veal, 

If the leg is used, it may be stuffed like pork, 
and requires nearly as much time to bake. It 
should be done a fine brown, and often ba^^ted. 

To roast Beef, 

Never salt fresh beef before you cook it in any 
way, for it draws out the gravy and leaves the 
meat dry. If the roasting piece is large, bake it 
three hours, otherwise two and a half. Make 
your gravy of the dripping. 

To boil a Tongue, 

Put a tongue into a pot o>^er night and soak, 
until three hours before dinner, then boil. 

To boil a Leg of Lamb, Mutton^ or Veal, 

Lot the water boil before any fresh meat is put 
in, that the richness of the meat may not bo lost. 
Boil a piece of pork with either of the above, but 
not with vegetal >lcs; when done, make a gravy 
with drawn butter. 

Mutton Chops, 

Take pieces of mutton that are not good for 
steak, ribs or other pieces, have them cut small, and 
boil them in water sutficieut t(» cook them tender ; 
add salt, pepper, and if not fat enough to make 
good gravy, add a little butter, or, if preferred, cut 
a little pork fine and boil with the meat, which 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIBE. 



•29 



will make it nearly salt enough, and suffident 
gravy ; let them fry, after the water is out, a little 
brown. 

Fricaseed Beef, 

Take any piece of beef from the fore quarter, 
such as is generally used for corning, and cook it 
tender in just water sufficient to have it all eva- 
porate in cooking. When about half done, puc in 
salt enough to just season it well, and half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper. If the water should not be 
done out soon enough, turn it off and let it fry 
fifteen minutes, turning it often ; and it is even 
-better than the best roaot beef. Make your gravy 
of the dripping. Take one or two table-spoonsful 
-of flour, and add first the fat • when mixed, pour 
on the hot juice of the meat or hot water fi'om the 
tea-kettle, and your gravy will be nice. Serve 
with vegetables, and sallad, or apple sauce. ... 

Veal Ctitlet, 

Cut your veal as if for steak or frying, put clean 
nice lard or butter in your pan, and let it be hot. 
Peat up an egg on a plate, and have flour on an- 
other ; dip the. pieces flrst in the cggy then in the 
flour on both sides, and lay in the pan and fry 
until done, turning it carefully once. This makes 
an excellent dish if well prepared. This way is 
superior to batter. 

Rice Both. *^' »:■ 

Take the waste ])ieces of steak, or baked meat, 
chop fine and season with salt, popper, cloves, or 
cinnamon. Wash rice and mix with it, then tic 



30 



SKILFUL housewife's GUIDE. 



up in cloths to sliape of balls, and boil half an 
hour, and serve with drawn butter. 

French Rolls, 

Cut strips of beefsteak to make a roll as long 
as a knife blade, and larger than a sausage, stuff 
with a prepared stuffing, and sew up and bake, or 
fry in butter. Melt butter for a gravy. 

To make a Soup, 

Beef soup should be stewed four ours, at least, 
over a moderate fire, with a handful of rice, and 
just water enough to keep it covered. An hour 
before it is done, put in two or three common size 
onions, and ten or twelve common potatoes, pared 
and sliced, and a few carrots, if you like ; at the 
same time put in salt to season it well, and half a 
tea-spoonful of pepper. Some like a little lemon 
peel cut in thin slices, others prefer powdered 
sage and parsley, or savory, two tea-spoonsful. Stir 
up two or three eggs with milk and flour, and drop 
it in with a spoon. This makes a soup look nice ; 
but bread broken into the tureen is preferable, 
with the soup taken over it. 

Pea Soup, 

If you use dry peas, soak them over night in a 
warm place. Early next morning boil them an 
hour, adding a tea-spoon of saleratus ten minutes 
before you change the water. Then, with fresh 
water and a pound of salt pork, boil three or four 
hours, or until they are perfectly soft. Green 
peas require only about an hour.

or 



BouilU. 

Boil seven or eight pounds of beef in more 
water than enough to cover it. Remove the 
scum as it rises, then put in two carrots, two 
turnips, two onions, two heads of celery, two or 
three cloves, a faggot of parsley and sweet herbs. 
Let it boil gently four or five hours. Put a car- 
rot, a turnip, an onion, and a head of celery in to 
cook whole, and take them out when done and 
cut in small squares. Take out the meat careful- 
ly, skim off the fat, and lay the sliced vegetables 
into the soup, and add a spoonful of ketchup to 
heighten the flavour. Pour in a soup tureen, and 
serve as other soup. 

Mock Turtle Soup. 
Boil a calf's head, a knuckle of veal, a piece of 
ham six or eight hours. Reserve a part of the 
veal for force-meat-bdls to be added. Skim it 
carefully, and when the scum ceases to rise, sea- 
son with salt, pepper, cloves, and mace ; add 
onions and sweet herbs, and six sliced potatoes ; 
stew gently half an hour. Just before you take 
it up, add a half pint of white wine. Make balls 
about the size of half an egg, boil part, and fry 
the remainder ; put in a dish by themselves. For 
these take lean veal, pork, and brains, chop fine, 
and season with salt, pepper, or cloves, mace, 
sweet herbs, curry powder, with the oik of an 
egg to hold it together. , 

Macaroni Soup,

marjoram, parsley, salt, pepper, mace, and two or 
three onions. Break in small pieces a quarter of 
a pound of macaroni, and simmer in milk and 
water till swelled and tender. Strain and add to 

•the soup. To the milk add half a pint of cream ; 
thicken it with two spoonsfull of flour, and stir 
gradually into the soup, and boil a few moments 

, before serving. 

;. Vermicelli Soup, 

Make a rich soup of veal, mutton, or fowls, 
-old fowls that are not good for other purposes will 
•do for soup. A few slices of ham will be an ad- 
dition. Season with salt, butter, two onions sliced, 
sweet herbs, a head of celery cut small. Boil un- 
til tne meat falls to pieces. Strain it, add a quar- 
.' ter of a pound of vermicelli which has been scald- 
ed in boilding water. Season to your taste with 
:>salt and Cayenne pepper, and let it boil five 
- minutes. Lay two slices of bread in your tureen, 
Land pour the soup upon it. 

Fine Scmsages, 

Have two-thirds lean and one-third fat pork, 
' chop very fine. Season with nine tea-spoonsful of 
pepper, nine of salt, three of powdered sage, to 
every pound of meat. Add to every pan full, half 
a cup of sugar. Warm the meat, that you can 
mix it well win/h your hands ; do up a part in 
shiall patties, v/ith a little flour mixed with them, 
and pack the reef hi jars. When used, do it up

or they will fall to pieces. A little cinnamon to 
a part of them will be a pleasant addition ; tne 
sugar is a great improvement. They should be 
kept where it is cool but not damp. Tliey are 
very nice for breakfast. 

To roast a Beef^s Heart, 

Cut open, to remove the ventricles or pipes, 
soak in water to free it of blood, and parboil it 
about ten minutes. Prepare a highly seasoned 
stuffing and fill it. Tie a string around to secure 
it. Roast till tender. Add butter and flour to 
the gravy, and serve it up hot in a covered dish. 
Garnish it with cloves stuck in over it, and eat 
with jelly. They are good when boiled tender and 
fried in butter, cut in thin slices, seasoned with 
salt and pepper. 

Beef Cakes, 

Chop pieces of roast beef very fine. Mix grated 
bread crumbs, chopped onions and parsley ; sea- 
son with pepper and salt ; moisten with a little of 
the dHpping or ketchup ; cold ham or tongue may 
be added to improve it. Make in broad flat 
cakes, and spread a coat of mashed potatoes on the 
top and bottoms of each. Lay a piece of butter 
op every cake, and set it in an oven to brown. 
Other cold moats may be prepared in the same 
way for a breakfast dish. Slices of cold roast beef 
may be broiled, seasoned with salt and pepper, 
and well buttered ; served hot. They may be 
chopped fine, seasoned well, warmed with a little 
butter, dripju'ng, or water, seasoned well with salt 
and pei)per, and laid upon toa!:;t for a break-, 
fa^t dif?h.

several times. Serve them up together with gravy. 
The water should be cooked out, which will leave 
the vegetables a light brown. Sweet potatoes are 
good cooked in this way. 

Bologna Sausages, 

Boil fresh beef, chop it fine, and season it with 
Cayenne and black pepper, and cloves ; put it in 
cloth bags, and cut off for tea. 

Fresh Meat Balls, 

Boil the liver, heart, tongue, &c., chop and 
season with drawn butter. 

To make Sausages in summer. 

Chop raw pork and veal fine, and season with 
salt, pepper, and sage ; add a little flour, and do 
up in balls to fry, and they make a fine fresh dish, 
equal to those made entirely of pork. 

Fresh Meat Griddles, 

Chop all the bits of cold fresh beef or veal, sea- 
son with salt and pepper ; make a griddle batter, 
^nd lay on a spoonful on the iron, well buttered, 
to prevent its sticking, then a spoonful of the 
chopped meat, then a spoonful of batter over tbo 
meat, and when cooked on one side then turn,

To fry Calves Liver, 

Cut the liver in thin slices, season with pepper, 
salt, and, if you like, sweet herbs and parsley. 
Dredge with flour, and fry brown in lard or drip- 
pings. Cook it well, and serve with its own 
gravy. A calfs heart may be dressed in this 
manner. Slices of cold boiled ham may be added 
as an improvement. ^ 

To stew Beef, 

Take a good piece of fresh beef, not too f?*, rub 
with salt and boil in water just enough to cover 
it. An hour before you take it up, add pared 
potatoes, and parsnips, if you have them, split. 
Let them cook till tender, and turn the meat 
and butter between each layer; add water to 
make it moist with gravy, then lay on the cover 
and bake three quarters of an hour. 

To make a Pot Pie, 

Make your sponge as you would for biscuit, 
only shorter ; when you do it up, let it get just 
light, putting into the batter a little saleratus and 
salt ; when light take it on to the board and cut 
it in pieces like biscuit, only let them lie and rise 
without kneading them at all. When the meat is 
tender, there should be enough water to come just 
over the meat. Season it well with salt and pep- 
per, and dissolve flour in cold water and stir in 
enough to thicken it well. If the meat is very 
lean, put in butter, and when boiling hot, lay the 
crust over the surface and shut it up close, and 



36 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE^ 



not allow it to be opened again in half an hour, 
when it will be ready for the table, as light and 
nice as sponge. 

Alamode Beef, 

Tie up a round of beef to keep in shape ; make 
a stuffing of bread, as you would for a turkey, 
adding sweet herbs, if you have them ; cut holes 
in the beef and put in half the stuffing. Tie the 
beef up in a cloth and just cover it with water, 
and let it boil an hour and a half, or more ; then 
turn the h'quor off, and let the beef brown over a 
slow fire ; turn it often. Then take it out and 
add a little water, and make tne remainder of the 
stuffing in balls and lay them in, and when boiled 
they are ready to serve in a boat, or to turn over 
the meat. 

Souse. 

Boil it until it is tender and will slip off the 
bone. If designed to pickle and keep on hand, 
throw it into cold water and take out the bones ; 
then pack it into a jar, and boil with the jelly liquor 
an equal quantity of vinegar, salt enough to season ; 
cloves, cinnamon, pepper enough to make it plea- 
sant, and pour it on the souse scalding hot, and 
when wanted for use, warm it in the liquor, or 
make a batter and dip each piece in, and fiy in 
hot butter. This way is usually preferred, and is 
as nice as tripe. 

Tripe. 

This should bo boiled tender, pickled and cook- 
ed like sousC; or broiled like steak, buttered and 



V 



ftKILFUL housewife's GUIDE.

peppered well. If not pickled, it should be kept 
in salt and water, and changed every day while it 
lasts. 

Boasted Tripe* 

Cut the tripe in square pieces ; make a rich force-* 
meat ; spread it over the pieces of tripe, and roll 
them up tightly ; fasten them upon a spit, flour and 
baste them well, and serve them up with melted 
butter, and slices of Seville orange or lemon. 

Neck of Mutton, 

Boil the neck very gently until it is done enough, 
then, half an hour or twenty minutes before serving, 
cover it thickly with bread-crumbs and sweet herbs 
chopped, with a little drawn butter or the yolk of 
an egg, and put it into a Dutch oven before the fire. 

By this process the meat will taste much better 
than if merely roasted or boiled'; the dryness atten- 
dant upon roasting will be removed, and the dis- 
agreeable greasiness, which boiled meat, mutton 
especially, exhibits, will utterly disappear. Too 
much cannot be said of this method of dressing the 
neck and breast of mutton, for the liquor they have 
been boiled in will make very good soup. The' 
latter, the breast, after being boiled, may be boned^, , 
covered with forcemeat rolled round, and then 
roasted. The best end of a neck of mutton makes 
a good roast, but even the scrag may be sent to 
table, when cooked according to the above direc^ 
tiona. 

Loin of Veat 

This joint is usually divided, the kidney end =

roasted, and sent up with a toast under the fat, and 
melted butter in the dish. The chump end should 
be stuffed like the fillet, or sent up with balls of 
stuffing in the dish. The best end of the veal will 
make a good roast, served in the same way, stuffing 
being always an agreeable adjunct to veal. The 
breast is frequently roasted, but is not suited to the 
spit» 

Calfs Head^ Boiled. 

When thoroughly cleaned, the brains should be 
taken out, washed, soaked, and blanched, and 
boiled ; then mix well a little chopped sage, previ- 
ously scalded and warmed in melted butter ; serve 
in a separate dish with the tongue. If quite plain, 
the head must be sent up with parsley and butter j 
but it is sometimes brushed with yolk of egg, co- 
vered with bread-crumbs, and browned before the 
fire« 

To dress Pork as Lamb. 

Kill a ycung pig of four or five months ; dress 
the fore-quarters trussed with the shank-bone close, 
having taken off the skin. Serve with mint-sauce 
and salad. The other parts will make delicate 
pickled pork, steaks, or pies. 

Boiled Turkey, 

Fill the body of the turkey with oysters, and let 
it boil by steam without any water. When suffi- 
ciently done, take it up, strain the gravy that will 
be found in the pan, and which, when cold, will be 
a fine jelly ; thicken it with a little flour, add the 
l|quor of the oysters intended for sauce, also stewed, 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE.

and warm the oysters up in it. A fowl may be 
boiled in the same manner ; and, if there should be 
no steam apparatus, a small one can be put in a 
jar and immersed in a kettle of water. Should a 
fowl or turkey prove of a bad colour, smother it in 
sauce, celery sauce, or any white sauce. Pepper 
fowls and turkeys in the inside, and, when roasted, 
baste them well with butter. 

Fowls Boiled with Rice, 

Clean and wash some rice, put it into the body 
of the fowl, with a piece of butter rolled in flour, 
and a little lemon-juice and salt. Put it into the 
saucepan, and pour over it, instead of water, the 
following hla7ic» Cut a pound of veal and th'^^ same 
quantity of fat bacon into small pieces, and lay 
them in a stewpan with half a pound of butter ; do 
not allow them to brown, but while the meat is 
white, pour on boiling water, adding at the same 
time a clove, half a bay-leaf, a bundle of sweet 
herbs, and a little shalot. When sufficiently stewed, 
strain it through a hair seive over the fowl, which 
must simmer in it for three-quarters of an hour. 
The veal and bacon that has been employed in this 
hlanc may be put into a mortar, and pounded 
together for stuffing. It is the fashion to lard the 
breasts of boiled fowls with tongue. 

Boiled Chickens. 

Chickens should be plump, and very nicely 
boiled ; if wanted to be particularly good, they must 
be boiled in a hlanc. It is the fashion to send them 
up with tufts of cauliflower or white brocoli, divested 
of stem and leaves^ and white sauce.

Roasted Pigeons, 

Stutf the whole of the body of the pigeon with 
veal stuffing: some persons merely chop a little 
parsley and put it inside ; but the other is the belter 
way. Pounded veal and bacon, and bread steeped 
in milk, form an excellent stuffing for pigeons. 

To Cooh a Hare, Derrynane Fashion, 

Take three or four eggs, a pint of new milk, a 
couple of handsful of flour ; make them into a 
batter, and, when the hare is roasting, baste it well, 
repeating the operation until the batter thickens, 
and forms a coating all over the hare : this should 
be allowed to hroivn, hut not to hum. 

N. B. This is a very popular dish with the guest* 
at Derrynane Abbey. 

Scotch Collops. 

Cut the collops thill, beat them a little, fry them 
in but%'r for about two minutes, after having sea- 
soned them with a little beaten mace ; place them 
in a deep dish as they are fried, and cover them 
with gravy. Put some butter into the frying-pan, 
and allow it just to change colour. Then strnin 
the collops througli a cullender from the gravy, and 
fry them (juickly ; pour the burnt butter from the 
pan, and put in the gravy, adding a liltle lemon- 
juice. The gravy may be nuule of tiie Iriiumings 
of the veal ; serve it up with forcemeat balls. 

iStvecthreads. 
Sweetbreads should be soaked in warm water^

•and then blanched by bei ig thrown into boiling 
water, boiled for a few minutes, and then put into 
cold water. They may then be larded and roasted, 
or fried, and afterwards stewed in fine white or 
brown sauce. Sweetbreads may also be larded 
and braised, and being of themselves rather insipid, 
they will be improved by a relishing sauce and by 
a large quantity of herbs in the braise. Slices of 
lemon, put upon the sweetbreads while braising, will 
heighten the flavour, and keep them' white ; w^hich 
is very desirable when sent to table with white 
sauce. 

Bubble and Squeah 

Cut slices from a cold round of beef; let them be 
fried quickly until brown, and put them into a dish 
to keep hot. Clean the pan from the fat ; put into 
it greens and carrots previously boiled and chopped 
small ; add a little butter, pepper, and salt ; make 
them very hot, and put them round the beef with a 
little gravy. Cold pork boiled is a better material 
for bubble-and-squeak than beef, which is always 
hard ; in either case these should be very thin and 
lightly fried. 

Mimed Collops, 

Take n pound of juicy beef, a quarter of r pound 
of suet, and an onion ; remove every bit ol skin or 
gristle from the ment, and mince it with the onion 
very finely ; add a little pepper and salt, flour die 
collops, melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, stir in 
the collops, adding a little water or gravy, and a 
spoontul of ketchup or oyster-sauce. Ten inin'Ues

Another Minced Collops Receipt. 

Take some lean beef, mince it very small, sea- 
son it with pepper and salt, adding a very small 
quantity of vinegar ; press it down in an earthen 
vessel : it will keep for some days. When wanted, 
take out the necessary quantity, put it into a stew- 
pan, with a chopped onion, a spoonful of any 
eauce, some beef gravy, and a piece of butter rolled 
in flour. Keep stirring it round until quite hot, and 
then send it to table. 

A Scotch Haggis, 

Take the stomach of a sheep ; wash it until per- 
fectly clean with cold water ; then turn it outside in, 
scald it and scrape it with a knife quickly, and then 
put it into cold salt and water till needed. Take 
the hver, lights, and heart of a sheep, and parboil 
them: graie the liver and mince the other parts 
quite fiiie; mince also half a pound of suet ; toast 
a pound of round oatmeal-cakes before the fire ; 
mix all well together, season with pepper and salt ; 
then fill the bag, and before sewing it up, put in a 
little water in which two or three onions have been 
boiled, which will give sufficient flavour without the 
onions themselves. Put the bag, neatly sewed up, 
in a pan with enough of boiling water to cover it, 
and a small plate under it in the pan ; prick over 
with a needle to prevent it bursting, and let it boil 
four or five hours, keeping the haggis constantly 
covered with boiling water. 

Mutton Cutlets* 

Cut the back end of a neck of mutton into steaks,

and chop each bone short ; brush them with egg 
and cover them with crumbs, herbs, and seasoning ; 
mash some potatoes with a little butter and cream ; 
^ fry the steaka and put them round the potatoes piled 
in the middle of the dish. 

Cutlets, Hindostanee Fashion* 

Cut the chops from the neck ; pare away all the 
fat ; scrape the bone ; then have some very fine 
mashed potatoes ; wrap the cutlets in it ; brush 
them over with yolk of egg and fry them. They 
may also be fried in the same dipped in batter. 

Lamb and Mutton Cutlets* 

Cut a loin or neck in chops ; cut off the thick 
part of the bone at the bottom, and the point at the 
other end of the cutlets ; melt a little butter with 
some salt in a saucepan ; then put in the cutlets 
and stew them without browning. Let them cool ; 
then mix pepper and chopped parsley with the yolk 
of egg ; dip the cutlets into it and cover them with 
bread crumbs ; put them on a gridiron over rather 
a slow fire until they are of a nice colour ; squeeze 
lemon-juice over them, and send them to table. 

Mutton or Lamb Chops. 

Cut the chops very nicely, pare off the fat, and 
fry them a fine brown ; pile them up like hop-poles 
in the dish, with the bones meeting at the top, and 
place between each a slice of fried bread cut in the 
shape f)f half a largo pear. Make a pur6e of vege- 
tables of any kind, and lay it round in the bottom 
of the dish : peas or spinach with the lamb, turnips 
or tomatoes with the mutton. This is a cheap and 
elegant corner or ''ide dish.

Hotchpotch^ 

Prepare some carrots and turnips, by cutting 
them in dice ; take also celery, caulifiovvers, young 
onions, parsley, and any other vegetables, cut small, 
with a quart of green peas. Take a neck of mutton, 
not too fat, cut it into steaks, and put them on the fire 
with half a gallon of water. When it boils, skim 
it very thoroughly, then add the vegetables ; let all 
gently boil together till the s jup is rich, and half an 
h >ur before dishing, add a pint of young green peas 
and some salt. 

Mock Brawn, 

Split and nicely clean a hog's head, take out 
the brains, cut off the ears, and rub a good deal 
of salt into the head ; let it drain twenty-four 
hours ; then lay upon it two ounces of saltpetre, 
and the same of common salt : in thre<> days' time 
lay the head and salt into a pan, with just water 
to cover it, for two days more. 

Wash it well; and boil until the bones will 
come out ; remove them, and chop the meat as 
quick as possible, in pieces of an inch long ; but 
first take the sldn carefully off the head and the 
tongue, the latter cut in bits as above. Season 
with pepper and salt. Put the skin of one side 
of the head into a small long i)an, press the chop- 
ped head and tongue into it, and lay the skin of 
the other side of the head over, and press it down. 
When cold it will turn out, and make a kind of 
brawn. The head may probably bo too fat, in 
which case prepare a few bits of lean pork with the

head, Boil two ounces of salt, a pint of vinegar, 
and a quart of the liquor, and, when cold, pour it 
over the head. The ears are to be boiled longer 
than the head, cut in thin strips, and divided 
about it, the hair being nicely removed. Reboil 
the pickle often. 

Another Mock Brawn. 

Boil a pair of neats' feet very tender ; take the 
meat off, and have ready the belly-piece of pork, 
salted with common salt and saltpetre for a week. 
Boil this almost enough ; take out the bones, 
and roll the feet and the pork together. Then 
roll it very tight with a strong cloth and coarse 
tape. Boil it till very tender, then hang it up in 
the cloth till cold ; after which keep it in a sousing 
liquor, as is directed in the next receipt. 

To Keep Brawn, the Cambridge Way. 

To two gallons of water put one pound of wheat- 
bran, and a pound of salt ; boil one hour ; when 
cold, strain it, and keep the brawn in it. In ten or 
twelve days fresh pickle will be required. If, by 
length of carriage or neglect, the brawn be kept too 
long out of pickle, make as above, and having rub- 
bed it well with salt, and washed with some of the 
l)ickle, it will be quite restored to its former good- 
ness. 

Pigeons in Jelly. 

Save some of the liquor in which a knuckle of 
veal has been boiled, or boil a calfs or a neat's foot : 
put the broth into a pan with a blade of mace, a 
])u.ich of sweet herbs, some wliite pepper, lemon-

peel, a slice of lean bacon, and the pigeons. The 
heads and feet must be left on, but the nails must 
be clipped close. Bake them, and let them stand 
to be cold. Season them as you like, beforc bak- 
ing. When done, take them out of the liquor, 
cover them close to preserve the colour, and clear 
the jelly by boiling with the whites of two eggs ; 
then strai.i it through a thick cloth dipped in boiling 
water, and put into a seive. The fat must be per- 
fectly removed before it be cleared. Put the jelly 
over and round them rough. They must be trussed, 
and the neck propped up with skewers, to appear 
in a natural state, before they are baked. 

To pichle Oysters, 

Take those that are large, separate them from 
their liquor, and pour over them boiling water ; 
take them out and rinse them. Put them in a 
kettle with just water enough to cover them, a 
table- spoonful of salt to every hundred oysiers, 
and just let them boil up. Take them out on a 
large board, and cover them with a cloth. Take 
the liquor of the oysters, and with every pint mix 
a quart of the best vinegar, a table-spoonful of 
whole cloves, the same of whole black pepper, a 
tea-spoonful of whole mace. Heat the liquor, 
and when it boils, put in the oysters and stir them 
five minutes. Then let thorn cool. When cold, 
put them in jars and cover them securely.

EGGS. -^ 

Presemng Eggs, 

Put a layer of salt in the bottom of a jar, and 
stick the eggs point downwards into the salt, to 
make a layer. Then add another layer of salt, 
and then of eggs, until the jar is full. This keepa 
them fresh and good. They may be kept well in 
lime 'water and salt. They should be w^ell 
covered, and kept in a co6l place. One cracked 
one will spoil the whole. They are cheapest in 
spring, and during September. If you have hens 
of your own, keep ajar of lime water always ready, 
and put in the eggs as they are brought from the 
nest. Jars that hold four or six quarts are best. 
It is well to renew the lime water occasionally. 
There is no sure way of discerning the freshness of 
eggs. It is ahvays best to break them separately 
in a saucer when used. If you get them to pack, 
lay them in a pan of w^ater, and those that float, 
will not answer to put away. 

To hoil Eggs. 
The fresher they are, the longer time tLej re- 
quire. Three minutes will boil them very soft, 
five minutes will cook hard all but the yolk, and 
eight minutes will cook them hard through. Ten 
minutes will cook them hard enough for dressing 
to fish or salad. If you boil them in a tin egg- 
boiler placed on the table, scald it well, and then 
it will take five minutes to boil even soft. 

To fry Eggs. 

This is done usually after frying ham. If there 



48 



sk:clpul housewife's guide. 



is not enough of gravy from the meat, add some 
clean lard, and have it hot. Break the eggs into 
a bowl, and slip them carefully in the lard with- 
out breaking the yolk. Let them fry gradually, 
dripping the hot lard over them until they are 
cooked sufficiently, without turning them at all. 
Then lay them on a plate or dish as they are 
cooked, and they look much more delicate than if 
they had been turned. 

, ^ Poached Eggs. 

Th~ beauty of eggs cooked in this way, is to 
have the yolk blushing through the white ; which 
should be just hardened to form a transparent veil 
for the e^^. Have some boiling water in a stew- 
pan, let it be half full, break each egg separately 
■' ito a saucer, and carefully slip it into the water. 
When the eggs are set, put the pan on the coals, 
and i. he water boils, they are done. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Beat seven or eight eggs quite light, throw them 
into a pan, with salt and butter. Stir them, until 
well thickened, and turn them on a hot dish, 
without allowing any to adhere to the pan. This 
is excellent with a light breakfast. 

Omelet, 
Five or six eggs will make a good sized omelet ; 
break them into a basin, and beat them well with 
a fork. Add a salt-spoonful of salt, some chop- 
ped parsley, and two ounces of butter. Have the 
same amount of butter hot in the pan, and stir in 
the omelet until it begins to set. Turn it up all

round the edges, and when it is a nice brown, it 
is done. Turn a plate up over it, and take it up 
by turning the pan upside down. Serve hot. It 
should never be done until just wanted. 

Pickled Eggs, 

Boil twelve eggs quite hard, and lay them in 
eold water to peel off the shell, then put them in 
a stone jar with a quarter of a pound of mace, 
the same of cloves, a sliced nutmeg, a table-spoon- 
ful of whole pepper, a little ginger root, and a 
peach-leaf. Fill the jar with boiling vinegar, and 
cover it that it may cool slowly. After three 
days, boil the vinegar again, and return it to the 
eggs and spices. They will be fit for use in a 
fortnight. 

Bread Omelet 

Put a handful of bread crumbs in a sauce-pan, 
a little cream, salt pepper, and nutmeg. When 
the broad has absorbed all the cream, then break 
into it ten eggs, beat all together and fry like an 
omelet.

VEGETABLES. 

Potatoes, 

They should bo kept covered in winter to keep 
them from freezing, but in summer they need a 
dry place, and should have the sprouts rubbed off. 
When boiled, they should be v^^ashed and only 
pared where it is necessary. If they are inclined

to crack, put tliein in cold water. . When thoy 
are done, pour it olf, and keep them covered by the 
fire until they are wanted for the table. Old 
potatoes will require an hour, if large ; new ones, 
half an hour. Potatoes are nice when baked, but 
they require more than an hour in cooking. 

When the skins become shrivelled in spring, 
they should bo pared, sliced, and boiled in a 
small quantity of water, as they will req^dre but 
about fifteen minutes in boiling. Pound th'.*m 
with a beetle for the purpose, season them v/ell 
with salt, sweet cream, or milk, enough to mois - 
ten, or butter v^^ili answer the same purpose. 
Dish them, and, if you prefer, brown them on the 
top. Cold ones mtiy be cooked in various ways. 
They are very nice sliced as thin as possible, and 
warmed carefully in half a tea-cupful of cream, or 
milk, and salt to season them well. They make a 
favourite disli by being sliced rather thick, and 
then broiled on the gridiron, adding butter and 
salt. They are also nice, and look well, grated, 
minced with the yolk of an egg made in small 
eakes, and fried in butter for breakfast. " Snow 
balls'' are mealy potatoes boiled, peeled, and press- 
ed in a cloth into the shnpe of a ball. Potatoes, 
boiled and washed while hot, are good to use in 
making bread, ca'ce, puddings, &c. ; they save 
flour, and less shortening is necesssary. 

Turnips. 

Pare, or scrape the outside ; if large, cut them 
r . halves, or quarters ; boil as long as potatoes. 
When tender, place the^ji in a pan, lay ^ small

plate over them to press out the water ; when 
pressed once, heap them high and press again, re- 
peating it until the water is out. Then add salt 
and butter, and send them to the table hot. Dish 
them, and lay the pepper in regular spots, if you 
wish to have it look well. Turnips should be 
kept in the cellar where they will not dry or 
freeze. When cooked with boiled salted meats, 
they are sent to the table whole. 

Parsnips. 
Pare or scrape and split them in two, that the 
inside may cook tender, which will be in two or 
three hours, according to their size. Dry them 
in a cloth when done, and pour melted butter 
over them in a dish, or serve plain. They are 
good baked, or stewed with meat. They may be 
served with any boiled meat. , , 

Carrots, » 

These may be cooked as parsnips, to accompany 
boiled beef, or mutton. Small ones will cook in 
an hour. • ;* 

Cahhage, " '■ '* 

All vegetables of this species should be care- 
fully examined and washed, then cut in two, and 
placed in cold water awhile, with a little common 
salt thrown into it. It is said, that this will draw 
out the worms or insects, and that they will sink 
to the bottom, so that greens or cabbages may be 
made free from any thing of the kind. They 
should be boiled an hour or more, and the water 
pressed out before sent to the table. They should 
be kept in the cellar, or in i- ^ole in the ground.

Cauliflower, 

Separate tlie green part, and cut the stalk close, 
let it soak awhile in cold water, tie it in a cloth, 
and lay it in boiling milk and water, observing to 
skim it well. When tender, which will be in an 
hour and a half or two hours, take it up, and drain 
it well ; send it to the table with melted butter in 
e boat. Brocoli is cooked in the same manner. 

Beets, 

Wash them clean with a cloth, rubbing them 
well. Be careiul not to cut them, unless they 
are very large, and then you may cut them in two, 
not spfitting them. They require, when grown, 
full size, three or four hours boiling. When ten- 
der all through, scrape off the outside, split or 
cut them in thin round slices, and pour over melt- 
ed butter, and sprinkle with pepper. Boiled beets 
sliced, and put in spiced vinegar until pickled, are 
good. The tops of beets are good, in summer, 
boiled as greens. Beets should be kept in the 
cellar, covered with earth to keep them fresh. It 
is said that they are nice, if roasted as potatoes 
for the table. 

Onions, 

It is well to boil onions in milk and water, to 
diminish their strong taste. They require an 
hour or more. When done, press out the water 
a little, and season them with a little salt, peppei, 
end a little melted butter. They should be serv-:- 
ed hot with baked, or roasted meats. They should 
be kept, prior to use, in a dry place,

Tomatoes, 

If very ripe, they may be skinned easily, but it 
is better done by pouring over them boiling 
water. Cut them fine and lay them in a stew- 
pan, with salt, a third of a tea-spoonful of pepper, 
and a piece of butter, cover them, and let them 
cook rapidly fifteen minutes. Have bread crumbs 
ready, rubbed fine, and add while boiling ; let the 
pair remain until they are soft, which will be, un- 
less too hard, in two or three minutes. They must 
cook gently after the Iw'ead is in. They are also 
good cooked in this way without the bread, but in 
that case they should be stewed uncovered, and 
longer. The former manner of preparing is gener- 
ally preferred, as it is less juicy. If cooked with- 
out the bread, they may be laid on a nice buttered 
toast, or sent to the table plain. They are kept best 
hung up on the vines in a dry place in the fall, as 
long as possible, but they should not be kept un- 
til they begin to decay. In Asia Minor, they are 
preserved for use during the winter, in the follow- 
ing mailner. Cut them in two, and sprinkle on 
them a quantity of fine salt to remain over night. 
Next day pass them through a cullender. Set the 
part strained through to dry in the sun, in shallow 
dishes, in depth an inch or less. Dry it to more 
consistence than jelly, and put in covered jars for 
use. If it is not sufficiently dry to keep, add more 
salt, and expose it again to the sun. A table- 
spoonful will season a soup or stewed meats.

Cut when two or three inches long, wash and 
phace the heads all one away, and tie in bundles 
wiUi thread or twine. Have your water boiling, 
with a little salt, and lay it in, keeping it boiling 
half or three quarters of an hour, according to its 
age. Toast two slices of bread, moisten it wdth 
the "water in w liich the asparagus is boiling, sea- 
son with salt, and lay on a small platter or dish. 
Then drain the asparagus a moment, and laying 
the heads invrard, spread it on the toast, pouring 
o^'er it melted butter and pei)})er. 

Green Peas, 

They are best when tirst gathered and shelled. 
They lose their flavour and sweetness by being 
kept ; but if kept, do not shell them until they 
are needed. Put them in while the water boils, 
and only ha\'e just enough to cook them fully. 
Season with salt, pepj^er, and a good supply of 
butter. If they have been liept, or if they are 
not a sweet kind, they are greatly improved by 
the addition of a spoonful of sugar, and if a little 
old and yellow, a }>iece of saleratus. Anothrr 
method is said to be an imju'ON ement. Place in 
your sauce-pan or boiler, scNeral leaves of head 
lettuce, imt in your i)eas, with an ounce of butter 
to two (puirts of i)eas ; cover the i)an or boiler 
close, and place it over the fire ; in thirty minutes, 
they are ready for the table. Season with pepper

Select those only that are tender, cut off the 
ends, and wash them wellj take a handful and lay 
them even, and cut them very fine with a sharp 
knife upon a hoard or table. Put them in when 
the water boils, and, if very tender, they will re- 
quire but half an hour ; if not, longer. Season 
as peas. 

Siueet Corn. 

This is sweeter for being boiled on the cob. 
If macV* into succotasli, cut it from the cobs, 
and ))oil it with new shelled beans. It will 
require half an hour or more. Season with 
sweet cream or butter, salt, pepper, a little nut-

a most delightful dish to accompany a nice bit of 
boiled pork. 

Spinach.

water on the beans, and boil them together until 
the beans become soft. Turn them out into a 
bean dish, or deep dish of some kind, lay the pork 
in the centre, having the rind just above the beans, 
pepper them, and have gravy enough to almost 
cover. It should be about even with the beans, 
then set in an oven and bake an hour, or until the 
pork is crisped. Some add a little molasses, and 
they are more healthy, if cooked with a little sa- 
leratus. Soft water should be used, if possible, 
to boil in, or saleratus is necessary. 

Dry Green Corn, 
It must be gathered when just good to boil, 
strip off the husks, and throw the cobs in boil- 
ing water, and let them remain until the water 
boils over them, then take them out and shell 
off the corn by running the prong of a long 
fork along the base of the grain. This method 
saves the kernel whole, and is much more ex- 
peditious. Spread it thin on cloths in an airy, 
shaded place, to dry, and stir it every day until 
thoroughly dry. When cooked, put it in cold 
water and boil three hours. Let the water boil 
nearly off, add a little milk and sweet cream, or 
butter, pepper and salt, and it is very nice. If you 
wish succotash, soak dry white beans over night 
and boil with them. It is a nice rare dish in 
winter and spring. 

Artichokes 
Are very good cut in thin slices, with vinegar, salt 
and pepper. If cooked, they must be boiled two 
or three hours closely covered, and, when tender, 
served with melted butter.

Fried Cucumbers, 

^Vhen pared, cut them in slices as thin as 
a dollar. Dry them with a cloth, season them 
with pepper and salt, and sprinkle them well 
with flour. Have butter hot, and lay them in. 
Fry of a light brown, and send to the table hot. 
They make a breakfast dish. When used raw, 
slice them into cold water to extract the unhealthy 
properties. Then season well with salt, pepper, 
and with vinegar. 

Sea Kale. 

This is prepared, boiled, and served up as aspar- 
agus. 

Mushroomj, 

Those of the right kind appear in August 
and September, after a heavy dew or misty night. 
They may be known by their pale pink or 
salmon colour on the under side on the gills, 
while the top is a dull peach coloured white. They 
grow only in open places where the air is clear. 
After they have been gathered a few hours, the 
pink colour turns to brown. There should be 
the utmost care in selecting only those that are 
good, as the others are a deadly poison. They 
are of various colours, sometimes all white, or 
scarlet, or yellow. It is easy to detect them 
when fresh, but not after they have lain awhile.

SALADS. 

Radishes. Wash them as soon as they aro 
brought in, and let them lie in clean cold water.

Before they go to table, scrape off the outside skin, 
trim the sharjD end, leave the stalk about an inch 
long ; if large, split them in four, half way down, 
and send them to table in tumblers, to 130 eaten 
with salt. 

Celery, Scrape and wash it well, let it lie in 
cold w^ater until wanted for use, dry it with a 
cloth, trim it, and split down the stalks almost to 
the bottom. Send it to table in a celery glass, and 
eat with salt only; or chop it fine and make a 
salad dressing for it. 

Lettuce. Strip off the outside leaves, split it, 
and lay in cold water awhile. Drain and lay in 
a salad dish. Have ready two hard boiled eggs, 
cut in two, and lay on tlie leaves. If you choose, 
it may be dressed with sugar and vinegar, with a 
little salt, before it goes to the table. Some pre- 
fer a dressing of salt, mustard, loaf sugar, and 
vinegar, sweet oil, and a mashed hard-boiled egg, 
with the salad cut fine, and this over it. 

Chopped Cabbage. When the heads are not 
close, cliop them fine, and season with red ])e]3per, 
salt, and vinegar, and it makes a very convenient 
and wholesome salad for the table.

PICKLES. 

Kettles of block tin, or lined with porcelain, are 
best for pickling. Iron discolours the vinegar, and 
brass or copper, unless used with great care, is 
poisonous from the verdigris prodiK^ed l)y acids. 
Pickles should nl^^ ays be covered with vinegar. If 



SKILFUL housewife's GUIDE.

they show symptoms of not keeping well, scald the 
vinegar with fresh spices. Vinegar for pickles 
should never boil over five minutes, as it destroys 
the strength. 

Cucumbers, Let your cucumbers be small, 
fresh gathered, and sound. Make a brine strong 
enough to bear an egg, boil and skim it, pour it 
upon the cucumbci », and let them stand twenty- 
four hours. Take good vinegar, cloves, cinnam'^n, 
and pepper, and boil all together. Have your 
cucumbers in a large jar, and pour the hot spiced 
vinegar over them. If you wish them green, add 
a little aluvii with the spices, to boil in the vine- 
gar. Cover them well. 

Melons. To make mangoes of melons, you 
must gather them green, and pour over them a 
boiling hot brine strong enough to bear an egg, 
and let them stand five or six days. Then slit 
them down on one side, take out the seeds, scrape 
them clean, then take cloves, ginger, nutmeg, or 
cinnamon and pepper, with small cucumbers, and 
mustard seed, to fill them ; sew them up with 
coarse thread, or tie them in a jar, and pour over 
them hot spiced vinegar. Cover them, and they 
will keep sound almost any length of time. 

Tomatoes, They should not be very ripe. Mix 
in a stone jar an ounce of mustard, half an ounce 
of cloves, half an oimce of pepper, with half a jar 
of vinegar. Lay in the tomatoes with a dozen of 
onions, and cover it close for a month. They will 
then bo fit for use. If the jar is kept well covered,

they will keep for a year. The onions may Bd 
omitted if you choose, and more spice substituted. 

Pepper, The bell pepper is considered best by 
some for pickling, and should be gathered when 
half grown. Slit one side and carefully take out 
the seeds and core, so as not to injure the shell. 
Pour over them a strong hot brine, and keep them 
warm ; some simmer them a whole day. You 
may take them out next morning, when cool, and 
stuff them like mangoes, or lay them in a jar with 
mustard sprinkled over them, and fill up the jar 
with vinegar. They require no spice, and should 
be pickled alone. The vinegar may be put on 
cold, with a piece of alum to give them a fine 
green, and it tends to harden and preserve pickles 
of any kind. 

Butternuts, Gather them when they are easily 
penetrated by a pin, as early as July, when the 
sun is hot upon them ; lay them in a tub, with 
sufficient lye to cover them, and stir them rou^d 
with a stiff broom to get off the roughness, or 
they may be scalded and rubbed with a cloth. 
Soak them in salt and water a week, then rinse 
and drain them. Pierce them through with a 
long needle, and lay them in a stone jar. Boil 
cloves, cinnamon, pepper, and ginger in the vine- 
gar, and pour over them. Sprinkle through them 
two spoonsful of mustard seed previously, if you 
have it. They should be closely covered from the 
air. Walnuts may be pickled in the same way. 

Peaches. Take any land of fine largo peaches

tliat are not too ripe, wipe off the down with a 
clean flannel, and lay them whole in a stone jar. 
Dissolvo a table-spoonfiil of salt to ea^h quart of 
vinegar cold, and cover them. Secure them well 
from the air. Plums and grapes, and barberries, 
may be pickled in the same manner, except the 
salt, with the stem on. Add spices if you choose. 
They look beautiful, and barberries are sometimes 
used to garnish the edge of dishes. 

Cherries, Use the common, or Morclla cherries, 
pick off 1 e stems, see that they are perfect, and 
lay them in a glass or earthen jar, with sufficient 
cold vinegar to cover them, and keep them in a 
cool place. They need no spices, as they retain 
their own flavour. 

Cauliflower, Select the whitest and closest, full 
grown ; cut off the stalk, and divide the flower 
into eight or ton pieces, scald them in strong 
salt and water ; let them remain in the brine till 
next day. Then rinse and dry them. Lay them 
carefully in a jar not to break or crush them, and 
pour over them hot spiced vinegar. When the 
vinegar is cold, a few barberries or green grapes, 
put in the same jar, does not injure them, ind adds 
much to their beauty on the table. Brocoli and 
asparagus the same. 

Cabbage. Take red or white cabbage, quarter 
it lengthwise and crosswise. Select the firmest 
for pickling, and after it has lain in salt water four 
days, drain it and pour over it hot vinegar, in 
which has been boiled cloves; macc; allspice, and 






SKILFUL housewife's GUIDE. 



If 



pepper ; if you wish to preserve the colour of the 
red cabbage, put a little cochineal to brighten it, 
with a little alum. It will be more tender to re- 
peat the scalding vinegar several times. Cover it 
closely. 

Onions, 1 eel and soak them in it ai id water 
three days. Then just scald tl \<u i. milk and 
water, drain and dry them. Scald the ^j "es with 
vinegar, adding a piece of alum, and, when cold, 
pour over them. If kept in bottles, put a few 
spoonsful of sweet oil on the top. Cover close. 

Sour Krout. Cut cabbage fine, then pack down 
in a cask, as follows ; first a sprinkling of salt, 
then a layer of the cabbage, then salt, then 
cabbage, until it is full, or nearly so. Then press 
it down closely, pounding it with something heavy 
to pack it close. Lay over it a round cover w^ith 
a stone, to ripen. It is not used until it has un- 
dergone a fermentation. When prepared for the 
table, it is fried in butter, or nice dripping, and 
is with many a favourite dish. 

Parsley may be tied in small bunches, and 
pickled like cucumbers. 

East India Pickle. This is a combination of 
various pickles in the same jar. Take radish pods, 
green peppers, long and round, green grapes, 
capus, nasturtions, walnuts, butternuts, peaches, 
apricots, cherries, and button onions ; pour over 
them a hot brine that will bear an egg, and let 
them stand four days, stirring them every day. 
Then make a pickle very warm with spices, and 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIPE.

after it has been boiled, and the ingredients well 
dried from the brine, pour it over them boiling 
hot ; mustard seed may be added, and then it 
must be covered close from the air. This will 
keep, if well prepared, for two years. 

Stone and wood are the only suitable materials 
in which to keep pickles. All pickles should be 
stirred up occasionally. When any scum rises, the 
vinegar needs scalding. When the vinegar be- 
comes weak, it should be thrown away, and new 
substituted in its place. Good, but not the 
sharpest, vinegar is best for pickling. If brass or 
copper is used in preparing pickles, it should be 
thoroughly cleansed before using, \7ith vinegar 
and salt, and no vinegar allowed to cool in them, 
as it would then be poisonous. 

Cucumbers may be preserved in salt or brine, 
for any length of time. But there should be a 
weight upon them to keep them well covered, or 
they will become soft. When prepared for pick- 
ling, they must be soaked and scalded. No salt 
will be needed in the vinegar. 



KETCHUPS. 

Tomatoe Ketchup. 

Take six pounds of tomatoes, and sprinkle with 
salt ; let them remain a day or two, then boil, and 
press through a coarse seive or cullender. Put in- 
to the liquor half a pint of vinegar, cloves, pepper, 
ginger, and cinnamon, boil them one third away ; 
bottle tight. It should be shook before being 
used.

Mushroom Ketchup, 

Take the full grown tops of mushrooms, wash 
<;lean, crush them, and throw a handful of salt with 
every peck, and let them stand all night. Put 
in a stew-pan, and let them stand in a quick oven 
twelve hours. Strain 'them through a hair seive 
to press out all the juice. To every gallon of 
liquor, put of cloves, Jamaica or black pepper, 
and of ginger, an ounce each, and half a pound of 
salt. Set it on a slow fire to boil until half gone, 
then, when cooled in an earthen vessel, bottle for 
use. It sometimes needs boiling the second time 
to keep long. 

Walnut Ketchup, 

Take a peck of green walnut shells, put them 
in a tub, bruise and mash them, throw on two or 
three pounds of salt, and water enough to cover 
them. Let them stand six days, straining and mix- 
ing them until they become soft and pulpy. Drain 
out the juice by letting the tub stand on one side 
a little, with the shell in the elevated part. As 
often as it needs, turn out the liquor and continue 
it as long as there is any, w^hich will bo five or 
six quarts. Then boil it in iron as long as scum 
arises ; then add a quarter of a pound of gin- 
ger and allspice, two ounces of pepper and cloves, 
and let it boil slowly half an hour. The spicos^ 
should be powdered, and a quantity should go 
into each bottle. Cork them tight, and put them 
in a ccol dry place one year before the ketchup i& 
used.

Pudding Catchwp, 

' Mix together half a pint of noyau ; a pint of 
wine ; the yellow peel of four lemons pared thin^ 
and half an ounce of mace. Put the whole in a 
large bottle, and let it stand two or three weeks. 
Then strain, and add a strong syrup of sugar. 
Bottle it, and it will keep two or three years. It 
may be used for pudding sauce, mixed with melted 
butter, and various other sweet dishes.

Observations on Pastry/, 

An adept in pastry never leaves any part of it 
adhering to the board or dish used in making. The 
best thing to make it upon is a slab of marble or 
slate ; which substances cause less waste, being 
cold and smooth. The coolest part of the house, 
and of the day, should be chosen for the process ; 
the hands shorild be previously washed in very hot 
water ; and the less they touch the paste, the better 
and lighter it will prove ; nor should it be rolled 
much. 

In whatever way paste is made, wetting it much 
will render it tough. 

Salt Ivutter of the bej5t quality makes a fine flaky 
crust : for sweet things, wash it. 

Rema7'ks on Using Preserved F uits i^ Pastry, 
Preseived fruits are usually to ry when put into

paste that requires long baking : those that have 
been done with their full proportion of sugar require 
no baking : the crust for them should be baked in 
a tin shape, and the fruit afterwards added, and a 
cover may be baked on croquant tins. 

For fresh fruits, short crust is very suitable. 

Tarts may sometimes be iced. 

Heating the oven properly is very material in 
baking. Light paste requires it to be moderately 
hot ; if too quick, it will be burned and not rise 
well ; if too slow, it will be soddened, not rise, and 
want colour. 

Raised pies must be put into a quick oven, or the 
crust will fall. The cook should accurately know 
the proper heat for each article, as opening the 
door, to observe their progress, lets in the air, and 
often spoils them. 

Cakes or tarts, which are returned into the oven, 
after icing, require heat enough to harden only. 

Raised Crust for Meat Pies, or Fowls, ^c. 

Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal 
quantity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but not 
much of either. While hot, mix this with as much 
flour as you will want, making the paste as stiff as 
you C3n to be smooth, which you will make it by 
good kneading and beating it with the rolling-pin. 
When quite smooth, put a lump into a cloth, or 
^under a pan, to soak till near cold. ^ 

Those who have not a good hand at raising crust 
may do thus : Roll the paste oi proper thickness, 
and cut out the top and bottom of the pie, then a

long piece for the sides. Cement the bottom to 
the sides with egg, bringing the former rather further 
out, and pinching both together : put egg between 
the edges of the paste to make it adhere at the sides. 
Fill your pie and put on the cover, and pinch it 
and the side crust together. The same mode of 
uniting the paste is to be observed if the sides are 
pressed into a tin form, in which the paste must be 
baked, after it shall be filled and covered : but in 
the latter case, the tin should be buttered, and 
carefully taken off when done enough ; and as the 
form usually makes the sides of a lighter colour 
than is proper, the paste should be put into the 
oven again for a quarter of an hour. With a 
feather, put egg over at first. 

Fine Tart Paste, 

Mix half an cunce of sifted sugar with half a 
pound of flour, adding half a wine-glass of boiling 
cream : work two ounces of butter into it, roll it 
very thin, and, when made into tarts, brush it over 
with white of egg. 

Short Crust. 

Mix two ounces of sugar with a pound of flour, 
rub into it three ounces of 'utter ; beat the yolks of 
two eggs into a little crea n, using sufficient to 
make the flour into a paste, roll it out thin, and bake 
in a moderate oven. 

Puff Paste. 4 

Sift half a pound of the best flour, rub lightly in- 
to it a quarter of a pound of butter, mix it with 
cold water, and roll it out. Lay on it, in small

pieces, part of another quarter of a pound of butter ; 
fold the paste, roll it again, and add the remainder 
of the butter ; strew lightly on it a little flour, and 
set in a cold place. 

Light Paste* 

Beat the white of an egg into a strong froth, mix 
with it as much water as will make three-quarters 
of a pound of flour into a stiff paste, roll it very thin, 
and lay upon it, at three several times, a quarter of 
a pound of butter. 

Tart Paste, 

Half a pound of sifted flour, a quarter of a pound 
of butter, two ounces of sifted sugar, and two eggs 
beaten : mix them with cold water, and knead the 
paste well. 

Cheap Pudding Crust, 

Two large, or three small, potatoes boiled, to a 
pound of flour, the potatoes well mingled with the 
flour, will make, with suet, a most excellent and 
light pudding-crust. 

Light Paste for Tarts and Chee.'wcakes. 

Beat the white of an egg to a ^>trong froth ; then

paste : roll it vv:;ry lhin,thcn Iny the third part of half 
a pound of butter upon it in lillle bits ; dredge it with

it out again, and put the same proi)orti()n of butter j 
and so proceed till all be worked up.

Croquant Paste for Covering Preserves, 

Dissolve a drachm of sugar in as much cold water 
as will make four ounces of flour into paste : knead 
and beat it as smooth as possible. Roll it to the 
size of the croquant form, and about a quarter of 
an inch thick. Rub the form with beef-suet, and 
lay it on the paste, and press it so closely as to cut 
the pattern completely through. Then lay it on a 
tin to bake. Witli a bunch of white feathers, go 
over the paste with the white of an egg beaten, and 
sift fine sugar on it. Bake it in a slow oven ; and 
gently remove the paste from the tin while yet 
warm, and lay it over the fruit it is to cover. The 
same cover will serve many times, if kept in a dry 
place. 

Icing for Tarts » 

Beat the yolk of an egg and some melted butter 
well together, wash the tarts with a feather, and 
sift sugar over as you put them into the oven. Or 
beat white of egg, w^ash the paste, and sift white 
tiugar. 

An Excdlent Method of Icing Tarts* 

Brush the pa<te over with cold water, and then 
sift pounded sugar very thickly over it before it is 
put into the oven. 

Veal Pie. 

The best part of veal for this })urpose is tho 
breast ; cut it ijito pieces and put it into n stewpan, 
with an onion, a stick of colcry, a bundle of sweet 
herbi'i and a small (luantity of water 5 when wanned

through, add more water, and stew it gently until it 
is done enough. By this means two pounds of veal 
will yield a quart of fine white stock, which will 
jelly ; let it remain until cold, and then take off all the 
fat ; take out the long bones and all the skin, season 
it well, and pile it lightly in the pie-dish, having lined 
the sides with paste. Boil four or six eggs hard, 
and put them in : pound some ham or gammon of 
bacon in a mortar, make them up into small balls, 
with a little butter, and add them (bacon or ham 
in slices always being hard) ; add nlso some force- 
meat-balls ; and fill up the pie with the stock, which 
should be flavoured with a small quantity of ket- 
chup, Harvey, or other sauce. Reserve appor- 
tion of the stock thus prepared, and pour it hot into 
the pie, when it comes from the oven, to supply the 
waste. T his will be most excellent ^'okl, as it will 
be perfectly free fiom all greasy particles, and the 
meat tender, which will not be the case unless pre- 
viously stewed. 

Veal and Siveethread Pie. 
Cut the veal from the chump end of the loin ; 
season it well ; clean and blanch a sweetbread, cut 
it into pieces, and season it ; lay both in the dish 
with the yolks of six hard-boiled aggs and a pint 
of oysters. Strain the oyster liquor, add to it a 
pint of good gravy ; line the sides of the dish with 
a pufF])aste half an inch thick, and cover it with a 
lid of the same. Bake it in a ([uick oven for an 
hour and a quarter ; and when it is sent to table, 
cut the lid into eight or ten pieces, and stick 
them round the sides, covering the meat uitli 
slices of lemon.

Calfs-Heador Calf's-Foot Pie, 

The head or feet must be well stewed before they 
are put into the pie. They must be cut into nice 
pieces, free from bone, and well seasoned, other- 
wise they will be tasteless. If to be eaten hot, 
sausage-meat or fresh mushrooms or oysters, will 
be an improvement, in addition to the ham, eggs, 
and force-meat-balls ; and if cold, small pickled 
mushrooms should be added, or a little mushroom- 
powder in the g^'avy. The excellence of the pie 
will chiefly depend upon the seasoning and flavour, 
and the quantity of fine savoury jelly which it 
will contain ; and therefore the meat should not 
be closely packed, in order to leave room for the 

jelly. 

Beef-Steak Pie. 

Take beef-steaks that have been well hung: 
beat them gently with a circular steak -beater ; 
season with pepper, salt, and a small shalot min- 
ced very fine. Roll each slice with a good piece 
of fat, and fill your dish. Put some crust on the 
edge, and only an inch below it, and a cup of 
water or broth in the dish. Cover with rather a 
thick crust, and set in a moderate oven. 

Mutton Pie. 

Cut the mutton into small pieces, season it very 
well, and stew it with the fat or suet also cut in 
pieces, j)utting m no water. When tender, allow 
it to reiiKun until cold ; remove all the grease and 
fat very carefully ; have some gravy made from 
the bones, add to it the strained gravy from the

Observation. — A single particle of grease will 
spoil a pie, and mutton pie especially. 

Macaroni Pie, 

Swell four ounces of pipe macaroni in milk, 
with a large onion. Put a layer at the bottom of 
a pie -dish, with some bits of butter and scraped 
best English cheese, sprinkled lightly over. Cover 
the whole with a Avell-seasoned beef-steak, then 
some more macaroni, then a fowl cut in joints and 
seasoaied, and then another beef-steak ; cover the 
whole with macaroni, pieces of butter, and grated 
cheese, instead of crust. Bake in a slow oven. 

Chicken Pie. 

Cut up two young fowls, season with white 
pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the 
finest powder ; likewise a little cayenne. Put the 
chicken, slices of ham or fresh gammon of bacon, 
forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs, by turns in layers. 
If it is to be baked in a dish, put a little water ; 
but none, if in a raised crust. By the time it re- 
turns from the oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle 
of veal, or a bit of the scrag, Avith some shank- 
bones of nnitton, seasoned with herbs, onion, mace, 
and white pepper. If it is made in a dish, [)ut as 
much gravy as '/111 fill it ; but in a raised crust, the 
gravy must be nicvly strrined, and then put in 
cold as jelly. To jiialve the jelly clear, you may 
givo it a boil \:hh tlio whites of twt eggs, after 
taking away tli« ;:at^ and then run it through 
a fine lawn aeive.

Rabbits, if young atid in flesh, do as well ; their 
legs should be cut short, and the breast bones 
must not go in, but will help to make the gravy. 

Pigeon Pies, 

Line the sides of a dish with paste, and put at 
the bottom either a beef-steak, well beaten and 
dredged with flour, or a veal cutlet; clean six 
young pigeons very nicely, pound a small quantity 
of ham in a mortar, with the livers, pepper, salt, 
and a blade of mace ; roll the yolks of six hard 
egg^i in this mixture, and put one into the inside 
of each pigeon, with a small lump of butter rolled 
in the forcemeat, and floured. Put the breasts of 
the pigeons downwards ; fill the dish nearly with 
water, or broth, if it is preferable ; put on the 
crust, and stick the feet of the pigeons in the 
middle, 

Gibkt Pie. 

After V ery nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, 
stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, 
black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till 
nearly done. Let them grow cold, and if not 
enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal, or two or 
three uuitton steaks, at bottom. Put the stew to 
bake with the above ; and when the pie is baked, 
pour in it a large tea- cupful of cream. Sliced 
])otatoes, added to it, eat extremely well.

Fine Fish Pie. 

Boil two pounds of small eels ; having cut the 
fins quite close, pick the flesh off, and throw the

floured cloth, or a melon-mould, eight or nine 
hours. Serve with sweet-sauce. Add sometimes 
a spoonful of peach-water for change of flavour. 
This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, six 
months, if kept tied up in the same cloth, and 
hung up, folded in a sheet of cap-paper, to pre- 
serve it from dr ;t, oeing first cold. When to be 
used, it must boil a full hour. 

Plum Piidding. 

The same proportions of flour and suet, and' 
half the quantity of i'luit, with spice, lemon, a 
glass of wine, or not, and one ag^, and milk, will 
make ctxi excellent pudding, if long boiled. 

Another Receipt for Plum Pudding. 

Lay a pound of beef suet in lumps, the size of 
nutmegs, in a basin, half a pound of jar raisins, a 
large spoonful of fine sugar, three eggs, a spoonful 
and a half of flour, ana a glass of brandy. Tie a 
wet cloth, doubled and well floured, over the basin. 
Put it into a pot of water that boils very fast, 
and move it about for some minutes. Boil five or 
six hours. 

Suet Padding. 

Shred a pound of suet ; mix, with a pound and 
a quarter of flour, two eggs beaten separately, a 
little salt, and as little milk as will make it. Boil 
it four liours. It eats well next dav, out in slices 
and broiled. The oiitvrard fat of loins or necks 
of mutton, finely shred, ujakos a more delicate 
pudding than suet ; and both are far better for 
the pui'pose than butter, which cause;?, the pudding 
to be black and close.

Baked Suet Pudding, 

Boil a pint of milk : when become cold, stir in- 
to it eight ounces of flour, and \Ax of shred suet ; 
add two eggs, and a tea- spoonful of salt. If to 
be plum pudding, put in eight or ten ounces of 
stoned raisins, and omit the salt. 

Rolled Pudding, 

Make a good paste, roll it out, and cover it 
equally over with currants, or chopped raisins and 
chopped apple, the latter making it very rich and 
moist ; roll it up, tie it in a cloth, and boil it ; 
serving it up, cut in pieces, with melted butter. 

An Economical Pudding, 

Half a pound of flour, half a pound of currants, 
half a pound of suet well chopped, and four ounces 
of treacle, with milk suflicient to mix it well 
together into a stift' paste or batter, the stiffness of 
boiled rice. Butter a basin, and let it boil five 
hours. When cold, it may be sliced and browned. 

Batter Pudding, 

To six ounces of flour add a little salt and a 
gill of milk ; mix them quite smooth, beat up four 
eggs and strain them, then add them to the bat- 
ter, with more milk, until the mixture is as thick 
as good cream. Strain the batter, and put it into 
a basin rubbed with butter ; tie a cloth over it, 
and boil it one hour. The excellence of a batter 
pudding mainly depends upon its being strained 
twice, that is, the eggs first, and then the whole ; 
if this point lie observed, it will be as rich and as

wine. 

Potato Pudding with Meat, 

Boil potatoes all fit to mash; rub through a 
cullender, and make into a thick batter with milk 
and two eggs. Lay some seasoned steaks in a

pour the remainder of the batter. Bake a fine 
brown. 

Custard, 

Boil half a pint of new milk, with a piece of 
lemon-peel, two peach leaves, and eight lumps of 
white sugar. Should cream be employed instead 
of milk, there will be no occasion to skim it. Beat 
the yolks and whites of three eggs, strain the milk 
through coarse muslin, or a hair-seive ; then mix 
the eggs and milk very gradually together, and 
simmer it gently on the fire, stiiring it until it 
thickens. 

Bread and Butter Pudding. 

Make a custard of an egg and half a pint of 
milk, by boiling the milk with a little lemon-peel 
and sugar, and beating up the egg in it, putting 
it on the fire to thicken ; then butter slices of 
bread or French roll, and soak them for an hour 
or two in this mixture ; then lay them in a dish,

add this to the yeast, and, after working the butter 
into the flour, add the yeast and milk just enough 
to make the bread stiff. Knead the whole together. 
Bread made of grown flour, must always be made 
harder or stifier than any other kind. In this wav 
good bread may be made. It should rise and bake 
like other bread.

How TO MAKE VINEGAR. 

Whiskey Vinegar. 

Take five g/'ons of soft clean water ; two quarts 
of whiskey ; two quarts of molasses, and half a 
pint of good fresh yeast. Lay a sheet of white 
paper at the bottom of the keg, and put in the 
mixture. Place it in the warm sun, and in six 
weeks it will be fit for use. If made in winteri it 
should be kept where there is a fire. 



SKILFUL IIOUSL'WIFE's GUIDE, 






^ Cider Vinegar. 

This may be made of poor cider, or that whicli 
is good, weakened a little with water. It should 
be partly drawn off, after the cider is well worked, 
leaving the casks about two thirds full. A piece 
of wire gauze, or a linen cloth, let in a little, 
should be nailed over for a cover to keep out fties, 
and also for a strainer. When the vinegar is good, 
which will be sometimes in six months by frequent 
shaking, it may be increased by adding occasion- 
ally the juice of fruit, the rinsings of sweetmeat 
jars, cold tea, &c. 
' «f • , ^. i • / Sugar Vinegar. 

To each gallon of water, add two pounds of 
brown sugar and a little yeast ; expose it to the 
sun for six months, in a vessel slightly stopped. 

Honey Vinegar. 

Mix one pound of honey with a gallon of cider, 
and expose it to the sun, or keep it where it is 
warm, and in a few months it will be so strong 
that water will be necessary to dilute it.

Ginger Beer, 

One cup of ginger ; one pint of molasses ; one 
pail and a half of water, and a cup of lively yeast* 
In warm weather it may be made cold, but in cold 
weather, scald the ginger with two quarts of hot 
water, and the rest cold. Add the yeast when 
slightly warm. It should be put in jars or bottles, 
and securely corked. It is a pleasant and lively 
beverage, and will keep several weeks. 

Common /Small Beer, 

A handful of hops to a pailful of water ; a pint 
of bran, and half a pint of molasses ; a cup of yeast 
and a spoonful of ginger. r %,j 

Boot Beer, ' *^'^ 

Take a pint of bran ; a handful of hops ; some 
twigs of spruce, hemlock or cedar ; a little sassa- 
fras, or not, as you have it ; roots of various 
kinds, plantains, burdocks, dock, dandelions, &c. ; 
boil and strain, add a spoonful of ginger molasses 
to make it pleasant, and a cup of yeast. When 
you want it soon, let one bottle stand where it is 
warm, and the rest will work cold. This for a 
gallon. 

Molasses Beer, 5 

Six quarts of water ; two quarts of molasses ; 
half a pint of yeast ; two spoonsful of cream tartar. 
Stir all together. Add the grated peel of a lemon ; 
and the juice may be substituted for the cream 
tartar. Bottle, after standing ten or twelve hours, 
with a raisin in each,

Haroest Drink. 

Mix with five gallons of water, half a gallon of 
molasses, one quart of vinegar, and two ounces of 
powdered ginger. This will make not only a 
very pleasant beverage, but one highly invigorat- 
ing and healthful. 

* To Restore Acid Beer, 

Stir in a small quantify of saleratus with a 
spoonful of sugar, and it is even richer and better 
than at first. To be prepared as you use it. 

Lemonade, 

Take good lemons, roll them, then cut and 
squeeze them into a pitcher. Add loaf sugar and 
cold water, till it makes a pleasant drink. It 
should be sweet ; it is sometimes too acid to be 
agreeable. Send round in small glasses with 
handles, or in tumblers a little more than half full. 
It is a favourite beverage for evening parties.

those whose bad app ;tite will not allow them to 
take the necessary nourishment, than to stimulate 
that of persons in health. 

It may be unnecessary to advise that a choice 
be made of things most likely to agree with the 
patient; that a change be provided; that somo 
one at least be always ready ; that not too much 
of those be made at once which are not likely to 
keep, as invalids require variety ; and that they 
should succeed each other in different forms and 
flavour. 

A clear Broth that will keep long* 

Put the mouse-round of beef, a knuckle-bone 
of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep 
pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust ; 
bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with 
only as much water as will cover it. When cold, 
cover it close in a cold place. When to be used, 
give what flavour may be approved. 

A quick-made Broth, 

Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, 
take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a 
small tin saucepan that has a cover, with three- 
quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first 
beaten and cut in thin bits ; put a bit of thyme 
and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. 
Let it boil very quick ; skim it nicely ; take off 
the cover, if likely to be too weak ; else cover it. 
Half an hour is suflicient for the whole process.

or roots may be added. Take half a pint three or 
four times a day. 

A mry nounshing Veal Broth, 

Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal, 
with very little meat to it, an old fowl, and four 
shank-bones of mutton extremely well soaked and 
bruised, three blades of mace, ten peppercorns, an 
onion, and a large bit of bread, and three quarts 
of water, into a stewpot that covers close, and 
simmer in the slowest manner after it has boiled 
up and been skimmed ; or bake it ; strain, and

Take a pound of lean beef, clear it from every 
particle of skin fat, oi sinew, rasp or divide it into 
very small pieces ; then put it into a jar, and pour 
a quart of boiling water upon it ; plunge the jar 
into a kettle of boiling water, let it stand by the 
side of the fire, but not near enough to simmer, 
and allow it to grow cold. Then strain the beef- 
tea througli a muslin-seive, and if the patient be 
very delicate, filter it througli blotting-paper. 

This tea is to be taken when cold, and will 
remain upon the stomach when other nourishment 
fails : it may be given to infants.

Beef Tea. -'i 

Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin slices ; sim- 
mer with a quart of water twenty minutes after it 
has once boiled and been skimmed. Season, if 
approved ; but it has generally only salt. 

Dr. Eatoliffes restorative Pork Jelly. 

Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up ; beat 
it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire 
with three gallons of water, and simmer to one. 
Let half an ounce of mace and the same of nut- 
meg, stew in it. Strain through a fine seive. 
When cold, take off the fat. Give a chocolate- 
cupful, the first o.nd last thing, and at noon, put- 
ting salt to taste. 

Shank Jelly. 

Soak tw^elve shanks of mutton four hours, then 
brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a 
saucepan with three blades of mace, an onion, 
twenty Jamaica and thirty or forty black peppers, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread made 
very brown by toasting. Pour three quarts of 
water to them, and set them on a hot hearth close 
covered ; let them simmer as gently as possible 
for five hours, then strain it off, and put it in a 
cold place. 

This may have the addition of a pound of beef, 
if approved, for flavour. It is a remarkably good 
thing for people who are weak. 

Broth of Beef ^ Muttony and Veal. 
Put two pounds of loan beef, one pound of

scrag of veal, one pound of scrag of mutton, svreet 
herbs, and ten peppercorns, into a nice tin sauce- 
pan, with five quarts of water : simmer to three 
quarts, and clear from the ft. when cold. Add 
one onion, if approved. 

Soup and broth made of different meats are 
more supporting, as well as better flavoured. 

To remove the fat, take it off when cold as clean 
as possible ; and if there be still any remaining, 
lay a bit of clean blotting or cap paper on the 
broth when in the basin, and it will take up every 
particle. 

Calfs'Fe4t Broth. 

Boil two feet in three quarts of water to half; 
strain and set it by ; when to be used, take off the 
fat, put a large tea-cupful of the jelly into a sauce- 
pan, with half a glass of sweet wine, a little sugar 
and nutmeg, and heat it up until it be ready to 
boil ; then take a little of it and beat by degrees 
to the yolk of an egg, and adding a bit of butter, 
the size of a nutmeg, stir it all together, but do 
not let it boil. Grate a piece of fk'esh lemon-peel 
into it. 

Another, 

Boil two calf 's-feet, two ounces of veal, and 
two of beef, the bottom of a penny-loaf, two or 
three blades of mace, half a nutmeg sliced, and a 
little salt, in three quarts of water, to three pints ; 
strain, and take off the fat. 

Chicken Broth. 

Put the body and the legs of the fowl that

chicken panada i/ras made of, as in the following 
receipt, afiter taking off the skin and rump, into 
the water it was boiled in, with one blade of 
mace, one slice of onion, and ten white pepper- 
corns. Simmer till the broth be of a pleasant 
flavour. If not water enough, add a little. Beat 
a quarter of an ounce of sweet almonds with a 
tea-spoonful of water, fine, — boil it in the broth, 
strain, and, when cold, remove the fat. 

Chicken Panada, 

Boil a chicken till about three parts ready in a 
quart of water ; take off the skin, cut the white 
meat off when cold, and put into a marble-mor- 
tar : pound it to a paste with a little of the water 
it was boiled in, season with a little salt, a grate 
of nutmeg, and the least bit of a lemon-peel. Boil 
gently for a few minutes to the consistency you 
like : it should be such as you can drink, though 
tolerably thick. 

This conveys great nourishment in small com- 
pass. 

Eel Broth. 

Clean half a pound of small eels, and set them 
on with three pints of water, some parsley, one 
slice of onion, a fe\/ peppercorns ; let them sim- 
mer till the eels are broken, and the broth good. 
Add salt, and strain it off. The above should 
make three half pints of broth. ' ' 

Arrow-root Jelly,

it has been counterfeited with bad effect. If 
genuine, it is very nourishing, especially for weak 
bowels. Put into a saucepan half a pint of water ; 
a glass of sherry, or a spoonful of brandy, grated 
nutmeg, and fine sugar ; boil up once, then mix 
into it by degrees a dessert-spoonful of arrow-root, 
previously rubbed smooth with two spoonsful of 
cold water ; then return the whole into the sauce- 
pan ; stir and boil it three minutes. 

Tapioca Jelly, 

Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on to 
wash it two or three times, then soak it in fresh 
water, five or six hours, and simmer it in the 
same until it become quite clear ; then put lemon- 
juice, wine, and sugar. The peel should have 
been boiled in. It thickens very much. ^ 

• Gloucester Jelly, '' 

Take rice, sago, pearl-barley, hartshorn shav- 
ings, aiid eringo-root, each an ounce ; simmer 
with three pints of water to one, and strain it. 
When cold it will be a jelly ; of which give, dis- 
solved in wine, milk, or broth, in change with 
other nourishment. ; 

-w*- Panada^ made in five minutes. 

Set a little water on the fire with a glass of 
white wine, some sugar, and a scrape of nutmeg 
and lemoii-peel : meanwhile grate some crumbs of 
bread. The moment the mixture boils up, keep- 
ing it still on the fire^ put the crumbs in^ and let

of 



it boil as fast as it can. When of a proper thick- 
ness just to drink, take it off. 

Another, 

Make as above, but, instead of a glass of wine, 
put in a tea- spoonful of rum, and a bit of butter ; 
sugar as above. This is a most pleasant mess. 

Another. 

Put to the water a bit of lemon-peel, mix the 
crumbs in, and, when nearly boiled enough, put 
some lemon or orange syrup. Observe to boil all 
the ingredients, for if any be added after, the 
panada will break and not jelly. 

Bread Jelly, 

Take a penny-roll, pare off the crust, and cut 
the crumb into thin slices ; toast them on both 
sides, of a light pale brown. Put them into a 
quart of spring water, let it simmer gently over 
the fire until the liquid becomes a jelly, strain it 
through a thin cloth, and flavour it with a little 
lemon-juice and sugar, added when hot. If wine 
be permitted, it is an improvement. This jelly is 
of so strengthening a nature, that one tea-spoon- 
ful affords more nourishment than a tea-cupful of 
any other. It may be prepared without the 
lemon-juice and sugar, and a tea-spoonful put in- 
to every liquid the patient takes ; such as tea, 
coffee, broth, &c. 

A restorative Jelly* 

Take one ounce of rice, the same quantity of 
sago, pearl-barley, hartshorn-shavings, and eringo 
root, put them into three pints of water, and let it 



% 



S8 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



simmer till reduced to one pint : then strain it off, 
and, when cold, put in a little wine or milk. 

Farinaceous Jelly. 

Tapioca, whole rice, pearl-barley, and sago, of 
each two ounces ; boil them in two quarts of 
water over a slow fire, stir while boiling, strain it 
through a seive, and flavour it with sugar, lemon, 
or orange juice. 

Sippets, when the Stomach will not receive Meat* 

On an extremely hot plate put two or three 
sippets of bread, and pour over them some gravy 
from beef, mutton, or veal, with which no but- 
ter has been mixed. Sprinkle a little salt over. 

Eggs. 

An Qgg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and 
mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast 
more supporting than tea solely. 

An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten 
separately, then mixed with a glass of wine, will 
aiFord two very wholesome draughts, and prove 
lighter than when taken together. 

Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in 
small quantity, convey much nourishment : the 
yolk only, when dressed, should be eaten by 
invalids. 

A Great Restorative. 

Bake two calf s-feet in two pints of water and 
the same quantity of new milk, in a jar, close- 
covered, three ho\irs and a half. When cold, re- 
move the fat. 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



99 



Give a large tea-cupful, the first and last thing. 
Whatever flavour is approved, give it by baking 
in it lemon-peel, cinnamon, or mace. Add sugar 
after. 

Another. 

Simmer six sheep's trotters, two blades of mace, 
a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few hartshorn 
shavings, and a little isinglass, in two quarts of 
water, to one ; when cold, take off the fat, and 
give near half a pint twice a-day, warming with 
it a little new milk. 

Another, 

Boil one ounce of isinglass shavings, forty Ja- 
maica peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, 
in a quart of water, to a pint, and strain it. 

This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house; 
of which a large spoonful may be taken in wine 
and water, milk, tea, soup, or any way. 

Another, a most pleasant draught. 

Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass shavings 
with a pint of new milk to half; add a bit d 
sugar, and for change, a bitter almond. 

Give this at bed-time, not too warm. 

Caudle. 

Make a very fine smooth gruel of half grits ; 
strain it when boiled well ; stir it at all times till 
cold. When to be used, add sugar, wine, and 
lemon-peel, with nutmeg. Some like a spoonful 
of brandy besides the wino ; others like lemon- 
juico. 



100 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



Another, 

Boil up half a pint of fine gruel, with a bit of 
butter the size of a large nutmeg, a large spoonful 
of brandy, the same of white wino,one of capillaire^ 
a bit of lemon-peel, and nutmeg. 

Another, 

Into a pint of fine gruel, not thick, put, while 
it is boiling-hot, the yolk oi an egg beaten with 
sugar, and mixed with a large spoonful of cold 
water, a glass of wine and nutmeg. Mix by de- 
grees. It is very agreeable, and nourishing. 
Some like gruel, with a glass of table-beer, sugar^ 
&c., with or without a tea-spoonful of brandy. 

Cold Caudle, 

Boil a quart of spring- water ; when cold, add 
the yolk of an Qgg, the juice of a small lemon, six 
spoonsful of sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and 
syrup of lemons one ounce. 

A Flour CavMe, 

Into five large spoonsful of the purest water, rub 
smooth one dessert-spoonful of fine flour. Set 
over the fire five spoonsful of new milk, and put 
two bits of sugar into it ; the moment it boils, 
pour into it the flour and water, and stir it over a 
slow fire twenty minutes. It is a nourishing and 
gently astringent food. Tliis is an excellent food 
for bah .s who have weak bowels. 

Rice Caudle. 
When the water boils, pour into it some grated 
rice mixed with a little cold water ; when of a 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



101 



proper consistence, add sugar, lemon-peel, and 
cinnamon, and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil 
all smooth. 

Another. 
Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain 
it and put two spoonsful of the rice into a pint 
and a quarter of milk; simmer till it will pulp 
through a seive, then put the pulp and milk into 
the saucepan, with a bruised clove and a bit of 
white sugar. Simmer ten minutes : if too thick, 
add a spoonful or two of milk ; and serve with 
thin toast. 

To Mull Wine. 

Boil some spice in a little water till the flavour 
is gained, then add an equal quantity of port, 
some sugar and nutmeg ; boil together, and serve 
with toast. 

Another way. 

Boil a bit of cinnamon and one grated nutmeg 
a few minutes in a large tea-cupful of water : then 
put to it a pint of port wine, and add sugar to your 
taste ; beat it up, and it will be ready. 

Or it may be made of good British wine. 

To make Coffee, 

Put two ounces ot fresh-ground coffee, of the 
best quality, in a coffee-pot, and pour eight coffee- 
cups of boiling water on it ; let it boil six minutes, 
pour out a cupful two or three times, and return it 
again ; then put two or three isinglass-chips into it 
and pour one large spoonful of boiling water on it, 
and boil it five minutes more, and set the pot by 



102 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



the fire to keep hot for ten minutes, and you will 
have coffee of a beautiful clearness. 

Fine cream should always be served with coffee, 
and either pounded sugar- candy or fine Lisbon 
sugar. 

If for foreigners, or those who like it extremely 
strong, make only eight dishes from three ounces. 
If not fresh roasted, lay it before the fire until per- 
fectly hot and dry ; or you may put the smallest 
bit of fresh butter into a preserving-pan of a small 
size, and when hot, throw the coffee into it, and 
toss it about until it be freshened, letting it be cold 
before ground. 

Coffee Milh. 

Boil a dessert-spoonful of ground coffee in nearly 
a pint of milk, a quarter of an hour ; then put into 
it a shaving or two of isinglass, and clear it ; let it 
boil a few minutes, and set it on the side of the fire 
to grow fine. 

This is a very fine breakfast : it should be sweet- 
ened with real Lisbon sugar of a good quality. 

Chocolate, 

Those who use much of this article \yill find the 
following mode of preparing it both useful and eco- 
nomical : — cut a cake of chocolate in very small 
bits ; put a pint of water into the pot, and wnen it 
boils, put in the above ; mill it off the fire until 
quite melted, then on a gentle fire till it boil 5 pour 
it into a basin, and it will keep in a cool place 
eight or ten days, or more. When wanted, put a 
spoonful or two into milk, boil it with sugar, and 
mill it well.

Patent Cocoa. 

Js a light wholesome breakfast. 

Saloop. 

Boil a little water, wine, lemon-peel, and sugar 
together : then mix with a small quantity of the 
powder, previously rubbed smooth with a little cold 
"water ; stir it all together, and boil it a few minutes. 

Milk Porridge. 

Make a fine gruel of half-grits, long boiled ; 
strain off; either add cold milk, or warm with milk, 
as may be approved. 

French Milk Porridge. 

Stir some oatmeal and water together, let it stand 
to be clear, and pour off the latter ; pour fresh water 
upon it, stir it well, let it stand till next day ; strain 
through a fine seive, and boil the water, adding 
milk while doing. The proportion of water must 
be small. 

This is much ordered w^ith toast, for the break- 
fast of weak persons abroad. 

Ground Bice Milk. 

Boil one spoonful of ground rice, rubbed down 
smooth, with three half-pints of milk, a bit of cinna- 
mon, lemon-peel, and nutmeg, Sweeten when 
nearly done. 

Sago. 

To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold water 
an hour, pour that off, and wash it well ; then add 
more, and simmer gently till the berries are clear, 
with lemon-peel and spice, if approved. Add 
wine and sugar, and boil all up together.

Sago Milk* 

Cleanse, as above, and boil it slowly, and wholly 
with new milk. It swells so much, that a small 
quantity will be sufficient for a quart, and, when 
done, it will be diminished to about a pint. Jt re- 
quires no sugar or flavouring. 

Asses^ Milk 

Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be niade. 
It should be milked into a glass that is kept warm 
by being in a basin of hot water. 

The fixed air that it contains give some people a 
pain in the stomach. At first a tea-spoonful of 
rum may be taken with it, but should only be put 
in the momen. it is to be swallowed. 

Artificial Asses Milk, 

Boil together a quart of water, a quart of new 
milk, an ounce of white sugar-candy, half an ounce 
of eringo-root, and half an ounce of conserve of 
roses, till hdf be wasted. 

This is astringent, therefore proportion the doses 
lo the effect, and the quantity to what will be used 
while sweet. 

Another, 

Mix two spoonsful of boiling waler, two of milk, 
and an egg well beaten ; sweeten with pounded 
white sugar-candy. This may be taken twice 
or thrice a-day. 

Another, 

Boil two ounces of haitshorni shavings, two 
ounces of pearl-barley, two ounces of candied eringo- 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



105 



root, and one dozen of snails, that have been bruised, 
in two quarts of water to one. Mix with an equal 
quantity of new milk, when taken twice a-day. 

Water Gruel, 

Put a large spoonful of oatmeal by degrees into a 
pint of water^ and, when smooth, boil it. 

Another Way, 

Rub smooth a large spoonful of oatmeal with two 
of water, and pour it into a pint of water boiling on 
the fire ; stir it well and boil it quick, but take care 
it does not boil over. In a quarter of an hour 
strain it oft', and add salt and a bit of butter when 
eaten. Stir until the butter be incorporated. 

Barley Gruel. 
Wash four ounces of pearl-barley ; boil it in 
two quarts of water with a stick of cinnamon, till 
reduced to a quart ; strain and return it into the 
saucepan with sugar and three-quarters of a pint 
of port wine. Heat up, and use as wanted. 

A very agreeable Drink, 

Into a tumbler of fresh cold water, pour a table- 
spoonful of capillaire and the same of good vine- 



gar. 



Tamarinds, currants fresh or in jelly, or scalded 
currants or cranberries, make excellent drinks, 
witira little sugar or not as may be agreeable. 

A refreshing Drink in a Fever, 

Put a little tea-sage, two sprigs of balm, and a 
little wood-sorrel, into a stone jug, having first 
washed and dried them ; peel thin a small lemon,

and clear from the white ; slice it, and put a bit 
of the peel in ; then pour in three pints of boiling 
water, sweeten and cover it close. 

Another Drink. 

Wash extremely well an ounce of pearl-barley ; 
sift it twice, then put to it three pints of water, an 
ounce of sweet almonds beaten fine, and a bit of 
lemon-peel; boil till you have a smooth liquor, 
then put in a little syrup of lemons and capillaire. 

Another, 

Boil three pints, of water, with an ounce and a 
half of tamarinds, three ounces of currants, and 
two ounces of stoned raisins, till near a third be 
consumed. Strain it on a bit of lemon-peel, which 
remove in an hour, as it gives a bitter taste if left 
long. 

A most pleasant Drink. 

Put a tea-cupful of cranberrid^ into a cup of 
water, and mash them. In the meantime, boil 
two quarts of water with one largo spoonful of 
oatmeal and a bit of lemon -peel ; then add the 
cranberries, and as much fine Lisbon sugar as 
shall leave a smart flavour of the fruit, and a 
quarter of a pint of .cherry, or less, as may be pro- 
per : boil all for halt' an hour, and strain off.

nutmeg scraped. Do not warm it after the egg 
is put in. Take it the first and last thing. 

Toast and Water, 

Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely 
brown and hard, but not the least black ; then 
plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it 
over an hour before used. This is of particular 
use in weak bowels. It should be of a fine brown 
colour before drinking it. 

Put a pint of milk, milk- warm, into a stewpan 
or other vessel before the fire, add to it half a 
table- spoonful of rennet. When the curd forms, 
cut it into squares to allow the whey to escape. 
Then put it on a seive carefully, for it must not 
be burned. 

Lemon Water, a delightful Drink. 

Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into a 
tea-pot, a little bit of the i)cel, and a bit of sugar, 
or a large spoonful of capillaire ; pour on a pint of 
boiling water and stop it close two hours. 

Apple Water. 

Cut two largo apples in slices, and pour a quart 
of boiling water on them ; or on roasted apples ; 
strain in two or throe hours, and sweeten slightly. 

White-wine Whey. 

Put half a ])int of new milk on the fire ; the 
moment it boils up, pour in as much sound raisin 
wine as will completely turn it, and it looks clear ; 
let it boil up, then set tlie soucoj>an aside till the

curd snbsides, and do not stir it. Pour the whey 
off, and add to it half a pint of boiling water and 
a bit of white sugar. Thus you will have a whey 
perfectly cleared of milky particles, and as weak as 
you choose to make it. 

Vinegar and Lemon Wheys, 

Pour into boiling milk as much vinegar or 
lemon-juice as will make a small quantity quite 
clear, dilute with hot water to an agreeable smart 
acid, and put a bit or two of sugar. This is less 
heating than if made of wine ; and, if only to excite 
perspiration, answers as well. 

Buttermilk, with Bread or without. 

It is most wholesome when sour, as being less 
likely to be heavy; but most agreeable when 
made of sweet cream. 

Dr, Boerhaave'^s sweet Buttermilk, 

Take the milk from the cow i:ito a small churn, 
of about six shillings price ; in about ten minutes 
begin churning, and continue till tlie flakes of but- 
ter swim about pretty thick, and the milk is dis- 
charged of all the greasy particles, and appears 
thin and blue. Strain it through a seive, and 
drink it as frequently as possible. 

It should form the whole of the patient's drink, 
and the food should be I)iseuitfl and rusks in every 
way and sort ; rijK» and dried fruits of various 
kinds, when a decline is apprehended. 

Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, 
make excellent suppers for invalids, with biscuits 
or common cake.

Orgeat 

Beat two ounces of almonds, with a tea-spoon- 
ful of orange-flower water, and a bitter almond 
or two ; then pour a quart of milk and water to 
the paste. Sweeten with sugar oe capillaire. 
This is a fine drink for those who have a tender 
chest ; and in the gout, it is highly useful, and 
with the addition of half an ounce of gum arable 
has been found to allay the painfulness of the at- 
tendant heat. Half a glass of brandy may be 
added, if thought too cooling in the latter com- 
plaint, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a 
basin of warm water. 

Orangeade or Lemonade, 

Squeeze the juice, pour boiling water on a little 
of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and 
sug ir to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are 
colu, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, 
with as much more water as will make a sherbet ; 
strain through a jelly-bag. Or squeeze the juice, 
and strain it, and add water and capillaire. 

Egg-Wine, 
Beat an o^g, mix with it a spoonful of cold 
water ; set on the fire a glass of white wine, half 
a glass of water, sugar, and nutmeg. When it 
boils, pour a little of it to the egg by degrees, till 
the whole be in, stirring it well ; then return the 
whole into a saucepan, put it on a gentle fire, stir 
it one way for not more than a minute ; for if it 
boil, or the egg be stale, it will curdle. Servo 
with toast.

COOKERY FOR THE POOR. 

GENERAL REMARKS AND HINTS. 

We subjoin a few hints, to enable every family 
to assist the poor of their neighbourhood at a very 
trivial expense ; and these may be varied or 
amended at the discretion of the mistress. 

Where cows are kept, a jug of skimmed milk is 
a valuable present, and a very common one. 

When the oven is hot, a large pudding may be 
baked, and given to a sick or young family ; and, 
thus made, the trouble is little. — Into a deep 
coarse pan, put half a pound of rice, four ounces 
of coarse sugar or treacle, two quarts of milk, and 
two ounces of dripping : set it cold into the oven. 
It will take a good while, but be an excellent 
solid food. 

A very good meal may be bestowed in a thing 
called a brewis, which is thus made :— Cut a very 
thick upper crust of bread, and put it into the 
pot where salt beef is boiling and near read- ; it 
will attract some of the fat, and when swelled out 
will be no unpalatable dish to those who rarely 
taste meat. 

A baked Soup, 

Put a pound of any kind of meat cut in slices, 
two onions, two ca/.rots, ditto, two ounces of rice, 
a pint of split peus, or whole ones if previously

pan, and pour one gallon of water. Cover it 
very close, and bake it with the bread. 

The cook should be charged to save the boiling 
of every piece of meat, ham, tongue, &c., however 
salt ; and it is easy to use only a part of that, and 
the rest of fresh water, and by the addition of 
more vegetables, the bones of the meat used in 
the family, the pieces of meat that co ie from 
table on the plates, and rice, Scotch luarley, or 
oatmeal, there will be some gallons of nutritious 
soup two or three times a week. The bits of 
meat should be only warmed in the soup, and re- 
main whole ; the bones, &c., boiled till they yield 
their nourishment. If the things are ready to put 
in the boiler as soon as the meat is served, it will 
save lighting the fire and second cooking. 

Take turnips, carrots, leeks, potatoes, the outer 
leaves of lettuce, celery, or any sort of vegetable 
that is at hand ; cut them small, and throw in 
with the thick part of peas after they have pulped 
for soup, and grits or co^^rse oatmeal which have 
been used for gruel. 

Should the soup be of poor meat, the long boil- 
ing of the bones and different vegetables will afford 
better nourishment than the laborious poor can 
obtain ; especially as they are rarely tolerable 
cooks, and have not fuel to do justice to what they 
buy. But in every family there is some super- 
fluity ; and, if it be prepared with cleanliness and 
care, the benefit will be very great to the receiver, 
and the satisfaction no less to the giver.

It was found, in a time of scarcity, that ten or fif- 
teen gallons of soup could be dealt out weekly,at an i 
expense not worth mentioning, though the veget- - 
ables were bought. If in the villages about Lon- 
don, abounding with opulent families, the quanti- 
ty of ten gallons were made in ten gentlemen's ^ 
houses, there would be a hundred gallons of 
wholesome agreeable food given weekly for the 
supply of forty poor families, at the rate of two • 
gallons and a half each. 

What a relief to the labouring husband, instead 
of bread and cheese, to have a warm, comfortable 
meal ! To the sick, aged, and infant branches, 
how important an advantage ! Nor less to the 
industrious mother, whose forbearance from the 
necessary quantity of food, that others may have 
a larger share, frequently reduces that strength 
upon which the welfare of her family essentially 
depends. 

It very rarely happens that servants object to 
seconding the kindness of their superiors to the 
poor ; but, should the cook in any family think 
the adoption of this plan too troublesome, a gra- 
tuity at the end of the winter might repay her, if 
the love of her fellow-creatures failed of doing it 
a hundred-fold. Did she readily enter into it, she 
would never wash away, as useless, the peas or 
grits of which soup or gruel has been made, 
broken potatoes, the green heads of celery, the 
necks and feet of fowls, and particularly the 
shanks of mutton, and various other articles 
which, in preparing dinner for the family, are 
thrown aside.

Fish affords great nourishment, and that not by 
the part eaten only, but the bones, heads, and 
fins, which contain an isinglass. When the fish 
is served, let the cook put by some of the water, 
and stew in it the above ; as likewise add the 
gravy that is in the dish, until she obtain all the 
goodness. If to be eaten by itself, when it makes 
a delightful broth, she should add a very small bit 
of onion, some pepper, and a little rice-flour rub- 
bed down smooth with it. 

But strained, it makes a delicious improvement 
to the meat-soup, particularly for the sick ; and, 
when such are to be supplied, the milder parts of 
spare bones and meat should be used for them, 
with little, if any, of the liquor of the salt meats. 

The fat should not be taken off the broth or 
soup, as the poor like it, and are nourished by it. 

An excellent Soup for the weakly. 

Put two cow-heels and a breast of mutton into 
a large pan, with four ounces of rice, one onion, 
twenty Jamaica peppers, and twenty black, a tur- 
nip, a carrot, and four gallons of water ; cover 
with brown paper, and bake six hours. 

Sago, 

Put a tea-cupful of sago into a quart of water, 
and a bit of lemon-peel ; when thickened, grate 
some ginger, and add half a pint of raisin wine, 
brown sugar, and two spoonsful of geneva ; boil 
all up together. 

It is a most supporting thing for thoso whom 
<iisease has left very feeble.

Caudle for the sich and lying-in. 

Set three quarts of water on the fire; mix 
smooth as much oatmeal as will thicken the whole 
with a pint of cold water ; when boiling, pour the 
latter in, and twenty Jamaica peppers in fine 
powder ; boil to a good middling thickness ; then 
add sugar, half a pint of well-fermented table- 
beer, and a glass of gin. Boil all. 

This mess twice, and once or twice of broth, 
will be of incalculable service. 

There is not a better occasion for charitable 
commiseration than when a person is sick. A bit 
of meat or pudding, sent unexpectedly, has often 
been the means of recalling long-lost appetite. 

Nor are the indigent alone the grateful re- 
ceivers : for in the highest houses a real good sick 
cook is rarely met with ; and many who possess 
all the goods of fortune have attributed the first 
return of health to an appetite excited by good 
kitchen 'physic, as it is called. 



CHAPTER VII. 

DAIRY. 

* On the management of Cows^ ^c. 

Cows should be carefully treated : if their teats 
are sore, they should be soaked in warm water 
twice a-day ; and either be dressed with soft oint- 
ment, or done with spirits and water. If the 
former, great cleanliness is necessary. The milk, 
at these times, should be given to the pigs.

milk^ 



When the milk is brought into the dairy, it 
should be strained and emptied into clean pans 
immediately in winter, but not till cool in sum- 
mer. White ware is preferable, as the red is 
porous, and cannot be so thorouglnily scalied. 

The greatest possible attention must be paid to 
cleanliness in a dairy : all the utensils, shelves, 
dressers, and the floor should be kept with the 
most perfect neatness, and cold water thrown over 
every part very often. There should be shutters 
to keep out the sun and the hot air. Meat hung 
in a dairy will spoil milk. 

The cows should be milked at a regular and 
early hour, and the udders emptied, or the quan- 
tity will decrease. The quantity of r^iilk depends 
on many causes, as the goodness, breed, and 
health of the cow, the pasture, the length of 
time from calving, the having plenty of pasture 
will tend to increase it. People who attend pro- 
perly to the dairy, will feed the cows particularly 
well two or three weeks before they calve, which 
makes the milk more abundant after. In gentle- 
men's dairies, more attention is paid to the size 
and beauty of the cows than to their produce, 
which dairymen look most to. 

For making cheese, the cows should calve from 
Lady-day to May, that the large quantity of milk 
may come into use about the same time ; but in 
gentlemen's families one or two should calve in 
August or September, for a supply in winter. In 
good pastures, the average produce of a dairy is 
about three gallons a day, each cow, from Lady-

day to Michaelmas, and from thence to Christmas, 
one gallon a day, Cows will be profitable milkers 
to fourteen or fifteen years of age, if of a proper 
breed. 

When a calf is to be reared, it should be taken 
from the cow in a week at turthest, or it will 
cause great trouble in rearing, because it will be 
difficult to make it take milk in a pan. Take it 
from the cow in the morning, and keep it without 
food till the next morning ; and then, being hun- 
gry, it will drink without difficulty. Skimmed 
milk and fresh whey, just as warm as new milk, 
should be given twice a-day in such quantity as 
is required. If milk runs short, smooth gruel 
mixed with milk will do. At first let the calf be 
ouj only by day, and feed it at night and morning. 

When the family is absent, or there is not a 
great call for cream, a careful dairy-maid seizes 
the opportunity to provide for a winter store : she 
should have a book to keep an account, or get 
some one to write down for her the produce of 
every \\ eek, and set down what butter she pots. 
The weight the pot will hold should be marked, 
on each in making, at the pottery. In another 
part of the book should be stated the poultry 
reared and the weekly consumption. 

Observations respecting Cheese* 

This well-known article diffi}rs according to the 
pasture in which the cows feed. Various modes 
of preparing may efiect a great deal ; and it will 
be bad or good of its kind, hy being in unskilful 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



117 



hands, or the contrary ; but much will still depend 
on the former circumstance. The same land 
rarely makes very fine butter and remarkably 
fine cheese ; yet due care may give one pretty 
good, where the other excels in quality. 

When one is not as fine as the other, attention 
and change of method may amend the inferior. 
There is usually, however, too much prejudice in 
the minds of dairy-people to make them give up 
an old custom for one newly recommended. This 
calls for the eye of the superior. A gentleman 
has been at the expense of procuring cattle from 
every county noted for good cheese, and it is 
affirmed that the Cheshire, double Gloucester, 
North Wiltshire, Chedder, and many other sorts, 
are so excellent as not to discredit their names. 
As the cows are all on one estate, it should seem 
that the mode of making must be a principal 
cause of the difference in flavour ; besides, there 
is much in the size and manner of keeping. 

Cheese made on the same ground, of new, 
skimmed, or mixed milk, will differ greatly, not 
in riches only, but also in taste. Those who 
direct a dairy in a gentleman's family, should con- 
sider in which way it can be managed to the best 
advantage. Even with few cows, cheese of value 
may be made from a tolerable pasture, by taking 
the whole of two meals of milk, and proportioning 
the thickness of the vat to the quantity, rather 
than having a wide and flat one, as the former 
will be most mellow. The addition of a pound 
of fresh -made butter, of a good quality, will cause

li 



the cheese made on poor land to be of a very dif^ 
ferent quality from that usually produced by it. 

A few cheeses thus made, when the weather is 
not extremely hot, and when the cows are in full 
feed, will be very advantageous for the use of the 
parlour. Cheese, for common family use, will be 
very well produced by two meals of skim and one 
of new milk ; or in good land, by the skim-milk 
only. Butter likewise should be made, and 
potted down for winter use, but not to interfere 
with the cheese as above, which will not take 
much time. 

Observations respecting Butter. 

There is no article of family consumption more 
in use, of greater variety in goodness, of more 
consequence to have a superior quality, and the 
economizing of which is more necessary, than this. 
The sweetness of butter, is "lot affected by the 
cream being turned of which it is made. When 
e ws are in turnips, or eat cabbages, the taste is 
very disagreeable, and the following ways have 
been tried with advantage to obviate it : — 

When the milk is strained into the pans, put to 
every six gallons one gallon of boiling water. Or 
dissolve one ounce of nitre in a pint of spring 
water, and put a quarter of a pint to every fifteen 
gallons of milk. Or, when you churn, keep back 
a quarter of a pint of the sour cream, and put it 
into a well scalded pot, into which you are to 
gather the next cream ; stir that well, and do so 
with every addition.

To make Butter* 

During the summer, skim the milk when the 
sun has not heated the dairy ; at that season it 
should stand for butter twenty-four hours without 
skimming, and forty-eight in winter. Deposit 
the cream-pot in a very cold cellar, if your dairy 
is not more so. If you cannot churn daily, 
change it into fresh pots ; but never omit churn- 
ing twice a- week. If possible, put the churn in a 
thorough air ; and if not a barrel one, set it in a 
tub of water two feet deep, which will give firm- 
ness to the butter. When the butter is come, 
pour oif the buttermilk^, and put the butter into a 
fresh-scalded pan, or tubs which have afterwards 
beeti in cold water. Pour water on it, and let it 
lie to acquire some hardness before you work it ; 
then change the water, and beat it with flat 
boards so perfectly that not the least taste of the 
buttermilk remain, and that the water, which 
must be often changed, shall be quite clear in 
colour. Then work some salt into it, weighs and 
make it into forms ; throw them into cold water, 
in an earthen pan and cover of the queen's ware. 
You will then have very nice and cool butter in 
the hottest weather. It requires more working in 
hot than in cold weather ; but it neither should 
be left with a particle of buttermilk, nor a sour 
taste, as is sometimes done. 

To preserve Butter. 
Take two parts of the best common salt, one 
part good-loaf sugar, and one part saltpetre ; beat 



120 



SKILFUL HOUSEWIFE S GUIDE. 



them well together. To sixteen ounces of butter 
thoroughly cleansed from the milk, put one ounce 
of this composition ; work it well, and pot down 
when become firm and cold. 

The butter thus preserved is the better for 
keeping, and should not be used under a month. 
This article should be kept from the air, and is 
best in pots, of the best glazed earth, that will 
hold from ten to fourteen pounds each. 

To prepare Butter for winter, the lest ivay. 

When the butter has been prepared as above 
du'ected, take two parts of the best common salt, 
one part of good loaf-sugar, and one part of salt- 
petre, beaten and blended well together. Of this 
composition, put one ounce to sixteen ounces of 
butter, and work it well together in a mass. 
Press it into the pans after the butter is become 
cool ; for friction, though it bo not touched by 
the hands, will soften it. The pans should hold 
ten or twelve pounds each. On the top, put some 
salt; and when that is turned to brine, if not 
enough to cover the butter entirely, add some 
strong salt and water. It requires only then to 
be covered from the dust. 

To manage Creim for Whey Butter, 

Set the whey one iay and night, skim it, and 
so till you have enough : then boil it, and pour it 
into a pan or two of cold water. As the cream 
rises, skim it till no more comes : then churn it. 
When new-milk cheese is made daily, whey-but- 
ter for common and present use, may be made to 
advantage.

To scald Cream, as in the West of England, 

In winter let the milk stand twenty-four hours, 
in the summer twelve, at least : then put the milk- 
pan on a hot hearth, if you have one : if not, set 
it in a wide brass kettle of water large enough to 
receive the pan. It must remain on the fire till 
quite hot, but on no account boil, or there will be 
a skim instead of cream upon the milk. You will 
know when done enough by the undulations on 
the surface looking thick, and having a ring round 
the pan the size of th€) bottom. The time requir- 
ed to scald cream depends on the size of the pan 
and the heat of the fire : the slower the better. 
Remove the pan into the dairy when done, and 
skim it next day. In cold weather, it may stand 
thirty-six hours, and never less than two meals. 

Buttermilk, 
If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and most 
wholesome food. Those who can relish sour but- 
termilk, find it still more light ; and it is reckoned 
more beneficial in consumptive cases. 

Buttermilk, if not Tcry sour, is also as good as 
cream to cat with fruit, if sweetened with white 
sugar and mixed with a very little milk. It like- 
wise does equally for cakes and rice-puddings, 
and of course it is economical, to churn before the • 
cream is too stale for anything but to feed pigs. 

To keep Milk and Cream, 

In hot weather, when it is difticult to preserve 
milk from becoming sour, and spoiling the cream, 
it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding the 



-^I'l' B'T'lli'ii ' III r'a

new milk very gently without boiling, and set- 
ting it by in the earthern dish or pan that it is 
done in. This method 's pursued in Devon- 
shire ; and, for butter and eating, would equally 
answer in small quantities for coffee, tea, &c. 
Cream, already skimmed, may be kept twenty-four 
hours if scalded without sugar '; and, by adding 
to it as much powdered lump-sugar as shall make 
it pretty sweet, will be good two days, keeping it 
in a cool place. 

JS^rup of Cream 

May be preserved, as above, in the proportion of 
a pound and a quarter of sugar to a pint of per- 
fectly fresh cream : keep it in a cool place for two 
or tliree hours ; then put it into one or two ounce 
phials, and cork it close. It will keep good thus 
for several weeks, and will be found very useful 
in voyages. 

To choose Butter at Market, 

Put a knife into the butter, if salt, ano smell it 
when drawn out ; if there is anything rancid or 
unpleasant, it is bad. Being made at different 
times, the layers in casks will vary greatly ; and 
you will not easily come at the goodness but by 
unhooping the cask, and trying it between the 
staves. Fresh butter ought to smell like a nose- 
gay, and be of an equal colour all through : if sour 
in smell, it has not been sufficiently washed ; if 
veiny and open, it is probably mi:jr'i with staler 
or an inferior sort. *

CHAPTER VIII. 

DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 

To dean Calico Furniture, when taken dc/wnfor the 

summer. 

Shake oiF the loos^e dust, then lightly brush with 
a small long-haired furniture-brush ; after which 
wipe it closely, with clean flannels, and rub it with 
dry bread. 

If properly done, the curtains will look nearly 
as well as at first ; and, if the colour be not light, 
they will not require washing for years. 

Fold in large parcels, and put carefully by. 

While the furniture remains up, it should* be 
preserved from the sun and air as much as possi- 
ble, which injure delicate colours ; and the dust 
may be blown oiF with bellows. 

By the above mode, curtains may be kept clean, 
even to use y ith the linings ne\7ly dipped. 

To clean Plate, 

Boil an ounce of prepared hartshorn-powder in 
a quart of water : while on the fire, put into it as 
much plate as the vessel will hold ; let it boil a 
little, then take it out, drain it over the saucepan, 
and dry it before the fire. Put in more, and serve 
the same, till you have done. Then put into the 
water some clean linen rags, till all be soaked up. 
When dry, they will serve to clean the plate, 
and arc the very boat things to clean the brass 
locks and finger-plates of doors. When the plate 
is quite dry, it must be rubbed bright with leather. 
This is a voi y nice mode. In many platc-powdcrs

there is a mixture of quicksilver, which is very 
injurious; and, among other disadvantages, it 
makes silver so brittle, that from a fall it will 
break. 

To clean Looking-Glasses. 

Remove the fly-stains and other soil by a damp* 
rag ; then polish with woollen cloth and powder- 
blue. 

To ^ 'eserve Gilding, and dean it. 

It is not possible to prevent flies from staining 
the gilding without covering it ; before which 
blow off" the light dust, and pass a feather or clean 
brush over it : then with strips of paper cover the 
frames of your glasses, and not remove +H1 the 
flies are gone. 

Linen takes off* the gilding, and deadens its 
brightness ; it should therefore never be used for 
wiping it. 

Some means should be used to destroy the 
flies, as they injure furniture of every kind, and 
the paper likewise. Bottles hung about with 
sugar and vinegar, or beer, will attract them ; or 
fly-water, put into little shells placed about the 
room, but out of the reach of children. 

To clean Paint, 

Never use a cloth, but take off' the dust with a 
little long-haired brush, after blowing off* the loose* 
parts with the bellows. With care, paint will look 
w^ell for a length of time. When soiled, dip a 
sponge or a bit of flannol into soda and water,

When wainscot requires scouring, it should be 
done from the top downwards, and the soda be 
prevented from running on the unclean part as 
much as possible, or marks will be made which 
will appear after the whole is finished. One per- 
son should dry with old linen, as fast as the other 
has scoured off the dirt and washed the soda oflf. 

To clean Paper-Hangings, 

First blow off the dust with the bellows. 
Divide a white loaf of eight days old into eight 
parts. Take the crust into your hand, and, be- 
ginning at the top of the paper, wipe it down- 
wards in the lightest manner with the crumb. Do 
not cross, nor go upwards. The dirt of the paper 
and the crumbs will fall together. Observe, you 
must not wipe above half a yard at a stroke, and, 
after doing all the upper part, go round again, be- 
ginning a little above where you left off. If you 
do not do it extremely Hghtly, you will make the 
dirt adhere to the paper. It will look like new if 
properly done. 

To give a Gloss to Fine Oak- Wainscot, 

If greasy, it must be washed with warm beer ; 
then boil two quarts of strong beer, a bit of bees*- 
wax as large as a walnut, and a large spoonful of 
sugar: wet it all over with a large brush, and, 
when dry, ru it till bright. 

To give a Fine Colour to Maliogany, 

Let the tables be washed perfectly clean with 
vinegar, liaving first taken out any ink-stains there 



126

may be with spirit of salt ; but it must be used 
with the greatest care, and only touch the part 
aflfected, and be instanly washed off. Use the 
following liquid: — Into a pint of cold-drawn 
linseed-oil, put four-pennyworth of alkanet-root 
and two-pennyworth of rose-pink, in an earthen 
vessel ; let it remain all night ; then stirring well, 
rub some of it all over the tables with a linen rag ; 
when it has lain some time, rub it bright with 
linen cloths. 

Eating-tables should be covered with mat, oil- 
cloth, or baize, to prevent staining, and be in- 
stantly rubbed when the dishes are taken off, 
while still warm. 

To take Ink out of Mahogany. 

Dilute half a tea-spoonful of oil of vitriol with 
a large spoonful of water, and touch the part with 
a feather ; watch it, for if it stays too long it will 
leave a white mark. It is therefore better to rub 
it quick, and repeat if not quite removed. 

Flow-Cloths 

Should be chosen that are painted on a fine cloth, 
which is well covered with colour, and the flowers 
on which do not rise much above the grouiid, as 
they wear out first. The durability of the cloth 
will depend much on these two particulars, but 
more especially on the time it has been painted, 
and the goodness of the colours. If they have 
not been allowed sufficient space for becoming 
thoroughly hardened, a very, little uso will injure

tliem ; and, as they are very expensive articles, 
care in preserving them is necessary. It answers 
to keep thein some time before they are used, 
either hung up in a dry barn where they will have 
air, or laid down in a spare room. 

When taken up for the winter, they should be 
rolled round a carpet-roller, and o^ erve not to 
crack the paint by turning the edges in too sud- 
denly. 

Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and 
seasoned some months before laid down. If for 
passages, the width must be directed when they 
are sent to the manufactory, as they are cut be- 
fore painting. 

To clean Floor-Cloths. 

Sweep, then wipe them with a flannel ; and 
when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a 
waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one ; 
but use little wax, and rub only enough with the 
latter to give a little smoothness, or it may en- 
danger failing. 

Washing now and then with milk, after the 
above sweeping and dry-rubbing them, gives as 
beautiful a look, and they are less slippery, 

Tc dust Carpets and Floors. 

Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, then sweep care*- 
fully. 

The former sliould not be swept frequently with 
a whisk-brush, as it wears them fast ; only once a 
week, and the other times with the leaves and a 
hair-brush,

''!i 



To clean Carpets, 

Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then 
laid down, and brush on both sides with a hand- 
brush ; turn it the right side upwards, and scout 
it with ox-gall and soap and water very clean, anc 
dry it with linen cloths. They lay it on grass, or 
hang it up to dry. 

To give to Boards a beautiful appearance. 

After washing them very nicely clean with soda 
and warm water and a brush, wash them with a 
very large sponge and clean water. Both times 
observe to leave no spot untouched ; and clean 
straight up and down, not crossing from board to 
board ; then dry with clean cloths, rubbed hard 
up and down in the same way. 

The floors should not be often wetted, but very 
thoroughly when done ; and once a-week dry- 
rubbed with hot sand and a heavy brush, the 
right way of the boards. 

The sides of stairs or passages on which are car- 
pets or floor-cloth, should be washed with sponge 
instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not 
be soiled. Diflerent sponges should be kept for 
the above two uses ; and those and the brushes 
fihou'd be well washed when done with. 

To extract Oil from Boards' or Stone. 

Make a strong ley of pearl-ashes and soft water, 
and add as much unslaked lime as it will take up ; 
stir it together, and then let it settle a few 
minutes ; bottle it, and step close ; have ready

«ome water to lower it as used, and scour the part 
with it. If the liquor should lie long on the 
boards, it will draw out the colour of them : 
therefore do it with care and expedition. 

To clean Stone Stairs and Halls, 

Boil a pound of pipe-maker's clay with a quart 
of water, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit 
of stone-blue. Wash with this mixture, and, 
when dry, rub the stones with flannel and a 
brush. 

To hlachen the fronts of Stone Cnhnney 'Pieces. 

Mix oil- varnish with lamp-black, and a little 

' spirit of turpentine to thin it to the consistence of 

;, paint. Wash the stone with soap and water very 

clean ; then sponge it with clear water ; and

extremely well. The lamp-black must be sifted

To take Iron-Stains out of Ma/rhle. 

An equal quantity of fresh spirit of vitriol and 
lemon-juice being mixed in a bottle, shake it well ; 
wet the spots, and in a few minutes rub with soft 
linen till they disappear. 

To preserve Irons from Bust, 

Melt fresh mutton-suet, smear over the iron 
with it while hot ; then dust it well with unslak- 
ed lime, pounded and tied up in a muslin. Irons 
so prepared will keep many months. Use no oil 
for them ^t any time, except seal oil, there being 
water in all other. 

Fire-irons should be kept wrapped in baize, in 
a dry place, when not used. 

Another way. 

Beat into three pounds of unsalted hog's-lard 
two drachms of camphor, sliced thin, till it is dis- 
solved ; then take as much black-lead as will make 
it of the colour of broken steel. Dip a rag into 
it, and rub it thick on the stove, &c., and the 
steel will never rust, even if wet. When it is to 
be used, the grease must be washed off with hot 
water, and the steel be dried before polishing. 

To take Rust out of Steel, 

Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed on 
it, and, in forty-eight hours, use unslaked lime 
finely powdered, to rub until all the rust disap- 
pears.

black-lead with a pint of small beer and a bit of 
soap the size of a walnut. When that is melted, 
dip a painter's brush, and wet the grate, having 
first brushed off all the soot and dust ; then take 
a hard brush and rub it till of a beautiful bright- 
ness. 

Another way to dean Cast-Iron and Black 

Hearths, 

Mix black-lead and whites of eggs well beaten 
together : dip a painter's brush, and wet all over ; 
then rub it bright with a hard brush. 

To take the Black off the bright bars of Polished 
Stoves in a few minutes. 

Rub them well with some of the following mix- 
ture on a bit of broad-cloth : when the dirt is re- 
moved, wipe them clean, and polish glass (not 
sand) paper. 

The Mixture* — Boil slowly one pound of soft 
soap in two quarts of water to one. Of this jelly- 
take three or four spoonsful, and mix to a consist- 
ence with emery. 

To clean Tin Covers and Patent Pewter Porter- 
Pots. 

Get the finest whiting, which is only sold in 
large cakes, the small being mixed with sand ; 
mix a little of it powdered with the least drop of 
sweet oil, and rub well, and wipe clean ; then 
dust some dry whitening in a muslin bag over, 
and rub bright with dry leather. The last is to 
prevent rust, which the cook must be careful to

fire when they come from the parlour ; for if but 
once hung up without, the steam will rust the 
inside. 

To prevent the Creaking of a Door, 
Rub a bit of soap on the hinges. 

A strong Paste for Paper,

sistence, and boil half an hour. Let it be cold 
before it is used.
