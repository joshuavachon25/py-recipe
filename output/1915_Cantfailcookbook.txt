IN preparing the Can't Fail Cook Book, it has been my 
aim to include only recipes that are practical, easy to prepare 
and therefore the most helpful. There is nothing in this 
book with which even the amateur may not have success if the 
simple directions be followed. The majority of the recipes are 
very inexpensive, and the materials used are ordinarily to be 
found in every home. 

A tin of ViTTUcci Virgin Olive Oil in the pantry is a real 
economy — for with it many delicious, appetizing and nourishing 
dishes can be prepared at little expense — and it is invaluable in 
preparing a satisfactory meal from the portions which would not 
otherwise be utilized. 

Physicians recommend the generous use of pure Olive Oil. 
ViTTUCCi Virgin Olive Oil contains, with the exception of the 
phosphates, all the valuable properties of that justly famous 
tonic — cod liver oil — with none of its disagreeable taste or after 
effects — and the phosphates are obtained in many of the foods 
with which the olive oil is employed. 

There is probably no article of diet which contains so great 
a food value as olive oil, and for this reason a taste for it, if not 
already possessed, should be cultivated. For those of you who are 
not now fond of the flavor of olive oil, I especially recommend 
the following recipes : 

Lemon Butter Philadelphia Cream Pie 

Orange Custard Lemon Pudding Sauce 

Lemon Pie Filling Chocolate Blanc Mange 

Chocolate Eclairs All Meats 

Fish and Cooked Vegetables 

in which the flavor of the olive oil cannot be distinguished. By 
trying these dishes first, the benefit of the oil may be obtained 
and a liking for it soon acquired. 

Read the short articles preceding recipes for meats, salads 
and sandwiches, then glance through the index and I believe you 
will find some suggestion for the next meal, something which may 
be prepared from the materials you have at hand. 

Very sincerely,

OLIVES are grown in many parts of southern 
Efurope, in Africa and in our own California, 
but admittedly the finest are produced in 
Northern Italy, where soil and climatic conditions 
unite to produce a fruit that is perfect and of re- 
markable richness. 

Oil produced from the olives of this area, is noted 
for its extraordinary richness and delicate flavor, and 
is considered the choicest production of olive groves 
the world over. Much greater care is exercised in the 
production of olives in this district than is given to the 
cultivation of our prize American apple orchards. 

The oil, which the first gentle pressing causes to 
flow, from these big sun-kissed olives, contains the 
highest nutritive elements and tonic qualities of the 
perfect fruit, and is aptly named Virgin Olive Oil. 
It has all the delicacy and virtue of the choicest olive. 

It is from the choicest olives produced in this 
section of Italy, and in one of the finest and most 
modern plants in all Italy, that Vittucci Virgin 
Olive Oil is extracted from the tree-ripened fruit. 

The olives are carefully hand picked to avoid 
bruising, and none but the choicest fruit is selected. 
From the time the olives are thoroughly washed in 
clear, cold spring water until the oil is hermetically 
sealed in the tins, it never at any stage comes in con- 
tact with human hands. 

The virgin olive oil from the first gentle pressing 
of the olives is several times washed in a spray of cold 
water until every particle of vegetable matter is re- 
moved. Then the oil is filtered first by a special 
filtering process and then through the finest cotton, 
until the purest oil it is possible to produce results. 
This is drawn into cans and hermetically sealed and 



comes to you direct from the olive groves. There is 
not the slightest chance of adulteration or contamina- 
tion. 

From the foregoing j^ou will readily appreciate 
that you may use Vittucci Virgin Olive Oil secure 
in the knowledge that every container holds the choic- 
est extract of one of the most nutritious fruits known 
to mankind. 

Do not assume that all olive oil is alike. There 
are as many varieties of olives as there are of apples, 
with as many differences in taste. 

The experienced eye can detect a great difference 
in the color of oil, usually indicating a like difference 
in quality. A clear golden color is evidence, under 
normal conditions of pure oil of fine quality. Some 
oils are rather green and others exhibit a tendency 
toward a brownish hue. These oils may be pure, but 
the olives may not have been of the best tasting va- 
riety, they may not have been picked at the proper 
time a^nd proper care may not have been exercised in 
the extraction of the oil. 

As there can be but one "first press" or Virgin 
Olive Oil extracted from a given quantity of olives, 
the term "Extra Virgin" is a misnomer. Equally 
misleading is the term "Lucca" when applied to olive 
oil to indicate quality; Lucca is merely the name of 
the town and district from which olive oil is shipped, 
and, obviously, many grades of high or low quahty 
may be known as "Lucca Olive Oil." 

It is always safest and undoubtedly insures the 
best results, to select an olive oil that you can always 
depend on being uniformly of the highest quality, and 
a double guarantee is to ask for Vittucci^s (pro- 
nounced "Ve-two'-che'"). 

In Europe olive oil has for centuries formed an im- 
portant part of the daily diet, and has and is being used 



extensively in cookery. European cooks are taught 
from their earliest days to use for frying, shortening, 
enriching and flavoring foods, those natural products 
which combine the highest degree of nutrition with 
the minimum of waste, and to the generous use of 
olive oil may be accredited in large measure the suc- 
cess of French and Italian cookery — and the freedom 
of Europeans from digestive and stomach troubles. 

Olive oil is very generally used for frying, be- 
cause it does not absorb odors from the food and may 
be used over and over again, simple straining after 
each use being all that is necessary. Fish are never 
so tasty, dainty and wholesome as when browned to a 
delicate, golden crispness in olive oil, and the same is 
true of doughnuts and many other standard house- 
hold articles of diet. However, to get the best results 
the highest quality of olive oil should be used, as the 
heavier oils are sometimes unpleasant in odor and 
taste, especially when heated. 

Not very many years ago olive oil was considered 
a luxury and its use was confined almost exclusively 
to medicinal purposes. But the American woman 
learns quickly — thousands of housewives throughout 
the land soon discovered that olive oil imparts to food 
flavored with it, a savor all its own. Within the last 
few years the consumption of olive oil in this country 
has doubled and trebled time and again. 

It did not take the astute American housewife 
long to discover that here was a means of enhancing 
her skill as a cook and at the same time an oppor- 
tunity to counteract to some extent, the rapidly in- 
creasing cost of living. She found that olive oil of 
high quality would keep longer than butter, had much 
greater utility in preparing a greater variety of ap- 
petizing dishes, and that its generous use promoted 



the health of her family. Hence, it has become a 
staple article of food in our homes and there is prob- 
ably no one other article of diet that contains more 
nutritive value, combined with adaptability and rea- 
sonableness of price. We take pardonable pride in 
our small part in this advance in American cookery, 
and it is to further this end that the "Can't Fail Cook 
Book" has been prepared. 

It is to protect you against imposition in the 
selection of olive oil that we have given our product 
its distinctive name, as guarantee of the absolute 
purity and elusive delicacy of Vittucci Virgin Olive 
Oil. Your dealer will refund your money if our oil 
is otherwise than as we represent it to be, the best and 
purest Virgin Olive Oil that human care and skill and 
the choicest olives in the world, can produce.

A Few General Direftions 



IN order to avoid absorbing grease, all food which 
is to be fried or sauted must be put into fat hot 
enough to immediately form a crust. It is very 
difficult with all fats but Olive Oil to reach this de- 
gree of heat without burning the outside of the food 
before the center is cooked. Olive Oil can be heated 
to greater intensity without burning than any other 
known fat, it being possible to reach a point of over 
600 degrees with Olive Oil, while 300 to 400 degrees 
is the limit of other fats. For this reason it is far 
superior to all others for frying purposes. 

Avoid frying too many articles at one time and 
always reheat between each frying. Use a wire frying 
basket for deep frying wherever possible. To test 
ViTTUCCi Virgin Olive Oil for frying, heat until 
it begins to smoke, then drop in a small cube taken 
from the "crumb" (soft center) of white bread. If 
this becomes golden brown in 40 seconds, the tempera- 
ture is right for previously cooked foods, such as 
croquettes, or for oysters or small fish, etc. For 
doughnuts, fritters, poultry, meats and thicker fish it 
should require 60 seconds for the bread to brown. 

Always put Vittucci Virgin Olive Oil in a 
cold kettle and bring slowly to the desired heat. Fish 
properly fried in Vittucci Virgin Olive Oil could 
not be improved upon. 

All good Olive Oil occasionally becomes thick 
and cloudy if left in too cool a place. While this does 
not in any way impair the quality of the oil, it makes 
it more difficult to work with — especially in the mak- 
ing of Mayonnaise. All that is necessary to do is to 
set it in a warm place until the oil clears.

Meats 



Roasts^ rubbed all over with Vittucci Virgin 
Olive Oil and allowed to stand half an hour or more 
before putting in the oven will have a delicious flavor. 

Chops, or other meat to be fried, should be 
browned quickly on both sides in about three table- 
spoonfuls of hot Vittucci Virgin Olive Oil, then 
allowed to cook more slowly. 

Stews may be thickened more smoothly and with 
less trouble than in any other way by mixing Vit- 
tucci Virgin Olive Oil with an equal quantity of 
flour (the quantity, of course, depending upon the 
quantity of the stew) and stirring this into the stew 
while boiling-. Stir and cook until it thickens.

Salads 



There is probably no dish which adds more to a 
luncheon, tea, or dinner than an attractively prepared 
salad, and no dish in which there is greater possibility 
for the display of originality. In making a salad, do 
not attempt to exactly follow proportions given in a 
recipe. Use your own judgment and combine what 
you may have on hand which will combine attrac- 
tively. While definite proportions are given herein, 
it is merely intended that they serve as ideas, which 
may be changed to appeal to the taste and conven- 
ience of the family. 

One thing should be borne in mind : a salad which 
is to be the principal dish at a meal should be sub- 
stantial. Such combinations as diced cold meat, first 
marinated in French Dressing, then drained, mixed 
with diced potatoes, celery, etc., and mixed with 
Mayonnaise or Boiled Salad Dressing, or fish with 
hard boiled egg are appropriate, or a combination of 
substantial vegetables, mixed with the heavier dress- 
ings. Where a salad is to be used merely as an "appe- 
tizer" or as an accompaniment to a hearty meal, it 
should be light and dainty — such as a green salad or 
fruit salad, served with French or any preferred 
dressing. 

When preparing a French Dressing, a very 
agreeable flavor may be obtained by rubbing the bowl 
with a clove of bruised garlic or a cut onion, or leave 
the garlic in the bowl while mixing the French Dress- 
ing, removing it when mixed. 

Almost any combination of vegetables, such as a 
spoonful of peas, a few cooked string beans, a little 
cucumber or cauliflower, mixed together and allowed 



35 



to marinate, then drained and mixed with Mayon- 
naise or Boiled Dressing, are deHcious. 

There is an endless possibility for converting left- 
overs into delicious salads, if mixed with any of the 
salad dressings found in this book.

Sandwiches 



SANDWICH MAKING 

Bread for sandwiches should be not less than two 
days old, and each slice should be spread before re- 
moving from the loaf. There will be no danger of 
crumbling and breaking if spread with Salad Dress- 
ing instead of butter. 

A lettuce leaf laid between all sandwiches is not 
only a pleasing addition, but will keep the sandwiches 
fresh longer. It should be wiped carefully, however. 

Unless the sandwiches are to be used at once, they 
should be wrapped, each variety separately, in 
paraffine paper. 

Any kind of meat can be made into dainty sand- 
wiches if all fat and gristle be removed, the meat 
minced fine and mixed with Mayonnaise or Boiled 
Salad Dressing. 

Any left-over vegetable, if carefully drained of 
all juice, and then allowed to marinate (stand in 
French Dressing) an hour, will make excellent 
sandwiches. 

One of the most delicious of all sandwiches is 
that made from our Lemon Butter recipe.
