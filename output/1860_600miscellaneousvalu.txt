PREFACE. 



T 



The title of this work is '* Six Hundred Miscel- 
laneous Valuable Keceipts, Worth their Weight 
IN Gold." The indication of it will at once show to 
the reader what he may expect by procuring a copy 
of it ; and, by perusing thoroughly the contents, he 
will be perfectly persuaded to have a copy of the 
same, let the cost be what it may; ancj that it will — 
what its title indicates — be worth its weight in gold. 
There should not be a family, young gentleman or 
lady, without a copy of this valuable book. It is not 
the great number of receipts that makes a book 
valuable ; only the usefulness is appreciated. The 
reader is referred to the Index to find what he wants. 
The heading of each department is in alphabetical 
order, and he will see it commences with a B, Bat- 
tery ; C, Cakes and Pies ; D, Diseases in human beings ; 
&c. &c. ; and each department is subdivided into an 
alphabetical order. For example : you have a sick 
horse ; all you have to do is to look for the H in the 
index, and you will find at the heading of this depart- 
ment ^'Horse-diseases, cures for," and whatever the 
disease may be you can find under this head. Say 
you want a cure for the gripes in a horse : look for 
"Gripes, cure for," and the corresponding number 



4 PREFACE. 

will be 444, which, after you have found this number, 
will be what you want to cure the gripes with ; and 
so on with every receipt you want to make use of, 
which is so simple that any school-boy who is able 
to read can find. The object of this book is to show 
in a clear and comprehensive manner how to use the 
within-mentioned receipts ; and they are embodied 
in as little space and as simple language as possible, 
and include all the information derived from them. 
The compiler has been thirty years in collecting 
some of the ^' Six Hundred Miscellaneous Valuable Re- 
ceipts, worth their weight in gold,'' some of which never 
before appeared in print, and some have been col- 
lected from the very best of works treating on this 
subject. His aim has always been to include all the 
very best and most useful and valuable receipts. It 
is not deemed necessary to comment on the useful- 
ness of the contents of this work, as all will have 
ample remuneration for the money laid out to pos- 
sess a copy of it. In the performance of the task 
of collecting these '^ Six Hundred Miscellaneous Valu- 
able Receipts,'' the chief aim was to render this book 
as extensively useful as possible. It is confidently 
believed that it will form a course of useful science 
for the farmer, mechanic, merchant, tradesman and 
professional man, as well as the heads of families and 
their children ; and it is also believed that there are 
few persons who will not find, on looking over its 
contents, some articles that will be useful and inte- 



PREFACE. O 

resting to them. The receipts are so simpie and 
plain that he who reads can understand. 

Should any of the readers wish to make use of 
some one of the receipts, and have not the necessary 
scales or measures for the compounding of the same, 
he only has to copy it off and go to a druggist, who 
will at once compound the article for him. And any 
person that wishes to manufacture for wholesaling 
articles, and the quantity of the ingredients men- 
tioned in the receipts is too large or too small, he, 
in either case, must make the ingredients in propor- 
tion to the quantity he intends to manufacture ; and 
he must also be careful to get always the very best 
of ingredients, or he may not succeed in getting the 
articles desired.

departments in the index, are as follows, to wit: —

In an apoplectic fit, no time ehould be lost in 
pouring down salt and water, if sufficient sensibility 
remain to allow of swallowing ; if not, the head must 
be sponged with cold water until the sense returns,

the lethargy. In a fit, the feet should be placed in 
warm water, with mustard added, and the legs 
briskly rubbed, all bandages removed from the neck, 
and a cool apartment procured, if possible.

To make a very superior Hair- Oil. 

Take half an ounce of alkanet-root, which may be 
bought for a few cents at the druggist's. Divide this 
quantity into four portions, and tie up each portion 
in a separate bit of new bobinet or clean thin mus- 
lin. The strings must be white : for instance, coarse 
white thread or fine cotton cord. Take care to omit 
any powder or dust that may be found about the 
alkanet, as if put in it will render the oil cloudy and 
muddy. Put these little bags into a large tumbler 
or a straight-sided white-ware jar, and pour on half 
a pint of the best fresh olive-oil. Cover the vessel, 
and leave it untouched for three or four days or a 
week, being careful not to shake or stir it ; do not 
press or squeeze the bags. Have ready some small 
clear glass vials, or a large one that will hold half 
a pint. Take out carefully the bags of alkanet and 
lay them in a saucer. You will find that they have 
coloured the oil to a beautiful crimson. Put into the 



60 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

bottom of each vial a small portion of any perfume 
you fancy : for instance, oil of orange-flowers, oil of 
jessamine, oil of roses, oil of pinks, extract of 
violets. The pungent oils (cloves, cinnamon, ber- 
gamot, lavender, orange-peel, lemon, &c.) are not 
good for the hair, and must not be used in scenting 
this oil. Having put a little perfume into the 
vials, poTir into each through a small funnel suffi- 
cient of the coloured olive-oil to fill them to the 
neck. Then cork them tightly, and tie a circular 
bit of white kid leather over the corks. To use this 
oil, (observing never to shake the bottle,) pour a 
little into a saucer or some other small vessel, and 
with the finger rub it into the root of the hair. 
The bags of alkanet may be used a second time.

frosting on the cake with the knife, soon after it is 
drawn from the oven, (it may be either warm or 
cold ;) smooth it over, and set in a cool place till 
hard. Allow the whites of 3 eggs for 2 common-

How to 'preserve Milk for any length of time. 

This process, invented by a Russian chemist 
named Kirkoff, consists in evaporating new milk 
by a very gentle fire, and very slowly, until it is 
reduced to a dry powder. This powder is to be 
kept in bottles carefully stopped. When it is to be 
employed, it is only necessary to dissolve the powder 
in a sufficient quantity of water. According to Mr. 
Kirkoff*, the milk does not lose by this process any 
of its peculiar flavour.

How to make Jajpan Black Writing-Ink. 

In 6 quarts of water boil 4 ounces of logwood in 
chips cut very thin across the grain. The boiling 
may be continued for nearly an hour, adding, from 
time to time, a little boiling water to compensate 
for waste by evaporation. Strain the liquor while 
hot, suffer it to cool, and make up the quantity equal 
to five quarts by the further addition of cold water. 
To this decoction put 1 pound of blue galls coarsely 
bruised, or 1| pounds of the best galls, in sorts, 4 
ounces of sulphate of iron calcined to whiteness, 
\ ounce of acetate of copper, previously mixed with 
the decoction till it forms a smooth paste, 3 ounces 
of coarse sugar, and 6 ounces of gum Senegal or 
arabic. These several ingredients may be intro- 
duced one after another, contrary to the advice of 
some, who recommend the gum, &c. to be added 
when the ink is nearly made. The composition

high gloss which it exhibits when written with, and 
a small vial of it has been sold for 12 cents. The 
above ink, though possessing the full proportion of 
every ingredient known to contribute to the per- 
fection of ink, will not cost more to those who pre- 
pare it for themselves than the common ink which 
can be bought by retail. When gum is very dear, or 
when no very high gloss is required, 4 ounces 
will be sufficient, with 1^ ounces of sugar. By 
using only | pound of galls to 4 ounces sulphate of 
iron, uncalcined, omitting the logwood, and acetate 
of copper, and the sugar, and using only 3 ounces

How to make Black Printers' Ink. 

Printers' ink is a real black paint, composed of 
lampblack and linseed-oil, which has undergone a 
degree of heat superior to that of common drying 
oils. The manner of preparing it is extremely sim- 
ple. Boil linseed-oil in a large iron pot for 8 hours, 
adding to it bits of toasted bread for the purpose of 
absorbing the water contained in the oil; let it rest 
till the following morning, and then expose it to the 
same degree of heat for 8 hours more, or till it has 
acquired the consistence required ; then add lamp- 
black worked up with a mixture of oil of turpentine 
and turpentine. 

The consistence depends on the degree of heat 
given to the oil, and the quantity of lampblack 
mixed up with it ; and this consistence is regulated 
by the strength of the paper for which the ink is 
intended. 

The preparation of printers' ink should take place 
in the open air, to prevent the bad effects arising 
from the vapour of the burnt oil, and, in particular, 
to guard against accident by fire.

Vinegar is used principally as a sauce and to pre-

ternally when an overdose of strong wine, spirit, 
opium, or other narcotic poison has been taken. A 
false strength is given to it by adding oil of vitriol 
or some acrid vegetable, as pellitory of Spain, capsi- 
cum, &c. It is rendered colourless by adding fresh- 
burned bone-black, 6 ounces to a gallon, and letting 
it stand for 2 or 3 days to clear. Mix cider and 
honey, in the proportion of 1 pound of honey to a

Cider Vinegar. 

The poorest sort of cider will serve for vinegar, in 
managing which, proceed thus : — 

First draw off the cider into a cask that has had 
vinegar in it before ; then put some of the apples 
that have been pressed into it ; set the whole in the 
sun, and in a week or 9 days draw it off into another 
cask. This is a good table vinegar.

How to Strengthen Vinegar. 

Suffer it to be repeatedly frozen, and separate the 
upper cake of ice or water from it. All vinegars 
owe their principal strength to the acetic acid they 
contain ; but the vinegar of wine contains also a 
tartar, a small proportion of malic acid, alcohol, and 
colouring-matter ; that of cider contains merely the 
malic acid, little or no alcohol, and a yellowish 
colouring-matter. ,

General Remarks on Dyeing, 

Cleanliness in dyeing is very essential. The 
vessel and the articles to be dyed must be rid of 
grease and dirt, as grease resists the colouring-par- 
ticles and dirt leaves a stain. Soft water should 
always be used for dyeing. Vessels used for dyeing 
small articles should generally be wash-basins, small 
copper and tinned pans, and sufficiently large that 
the dyeing-liquor be not spilled by dipping the 
articles in and out when dyeing. The quantity of 
liquor generally necessary for dyeing a dress of mus- 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 8B 

lin, crape, sarcenet, cambric, &c., is about three 
quarts ; for a larger dress, a proportionate quantity. 

The dyeing-utensils are simple, being composed 
of tubs, kettles, horse, or a couple of lathed benches, 
for the purpose of placing the goods upon when they 
come from the dye. The horse may be in form of a 
carpenter's stool. A doll, which is used for beating 
blankets, counterpanes, &c. in the tub, in order to 
clean them. For this doll some use an article similar 
to a pavior's mall, but of smaller dimensions : others 
have a circular piece of wood, two inches thick, in 
which four legs are fastened on the under side, and 
in the centre a pretty long handle, with a cross-piece 
put through it to work it with. Against the wall or 
a post fasten a hook or a pin to put on your skeins, 
and with a small stick wring them out. In fancy- 
dyeing the various shades of cambric, a winch is put 
in frequent use. 

The liquor should always be stirred with a spoon, 
rod, or any thing that is clean, previous to the article 
being dipped in it, to cause the colouring-particles 
to be equally diftused, so that the article to be dyed 
receives its colour uniformly; and it is also necessary 
that the article be moved in and out quickly, and 
opened to receive the colour more evenly. Colours 
generally look much darker when wet, therefore 
allowance should generally be made for drying, 
which should always be done in a warm room, pinned 
or stretched to a line. 

No. 160. 

Aluming. 
Is a preparation necessary for some colours in order 
to receive the colouring-particles, such as crimson 



B4 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

scarlet, purple, and some other colours. If any 
article is directed to be alumed, be careful to rid it 
well of the soap-suds, as alum turns soap to grease. 
When the article is put in the alum-liquor, it is to 
be well dipped in and out and opened, to receive 
this preparation more equally, for an hour, or all 
night, if circumstances admit; and, when alumed, 
it must be well wrung out and rinsed in two waters, 
and then dyed, the sooner the better, before getting 
dry. 

Note. — The aluming of silks ought to be done 
cold, or it will be deprived of its lustre. 

No. 161. 

Preparing of the Dye-Liquors, or Scalding the Wood. 

Having something like the end of a tub, about one 
foot deep, with a copper bottom, bored full of holes 
about a quarter of an inch in diameter, lay a piece 
of rather coarse sheeting on this ; lay it all together 
on another tub ; fill it with the wood to be scalded. 
Then, having a copper boiler full of boiling water, 
fill the tub which contains the wood with boiling 
water; stir it during the time it is going through; 
fill it up again, and so repeat the operation till you 
have got all the strength from the wood. 

The criterion by which to know when the strength 
is gone from the wood is the paleness of the liquor 
as it runs through. This operation is considered 
superior to boiling the wood in a copper boiler, 
especially for the ground wood : but either way will 
answer. The method of rendering the liquor stronger 
of course is by evaporation, in a copper vessel, with 
a constant fire under it. The chips of dyewood are 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 85 

generally superior to the ground wood, as they are 
not so likely to be adulterated.

required ;) hedge out, and put in a little alum-water ; 
again put in your goods, handle a little longer, then 
take out, drain, rinse well, and finish.

Black on Cotton, 

First take your pieces and boil them in sumach- 
liquor, in a large copper vessel, if you have it, that 
will hold 60 or 70 pieces, in which you put about a 
bushel and a half of sumach ; let them stay all night, 
if it is convenient ; take out, and enter them into 
the lime-tub, 3 at a time ; give them 4 ends, hedge 
out ; enter them into the copperas-tub, give them 5 
ends, hedge out; enter them into the lime again, 
give them 4 ends, hedge out ; enter them into another 
tub with tolerably strong logwood-liquor, give them 
5 ends ; put them to one side of the tub ; put in 
enough copperas-liquor to blacken them, (about a 
couple of quarts,) then give them a few more ends, 
and they are finished. With this process it is 
the same as with the greens. After sumaching, 
liming, copperasing, and second liming is repeated, 
till you get as many as will answer you to finish that 
day, the tubs being renewed after each 3 pieces, 
then comes the finishing; after each 3 pieces, the 
logwood and copperas liquor is thrown away, because

the copperas kills the logwood, and so renders it un- 
fit for the next pieces. It is frequently the case that, 
instead of the first process of sumach-boiling, they 
collect the old sumach, and fustic, and logwood- 
liquor, that has no copperas or lime in it, into a large 
tub, and all the pieces that are spoiled in the other 
colours they throw into this tub, and let them lie 
a few days till they are ready to dye blacks, and this 
answers instead of the sumaching. 

For the foregoing cotton shades, the pieces are 
first taken and boiled in a wood or copper cistern, as 
circumstances may be, in order to take out the 
sizing, and prepare them to receive the dye.

'Painters^ how to mix Colours to form different Shades, 
The various colours that may be obtained by mix- 
ture of other colours are numberless. It is only pro- 
posed to give some of the simplest and best modes 
of preparing those most frequently required. 

Compound colours formed by the union of only 
two colours are called by painters virgin tints. 
The smaller the number of colours of which any 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 109 

compound colour is composed, the purer and the 
richer it will be. 

Light gray is made by mixing white lead with 
lampblack; using more or less of each material as 
you wish to obtain a lighter or a darker colour. 

Buff is made from yellow ochre and white lead. 
Silver or Pearl gray,— Max. white lead, indigo, and a 
very slight portion of black, regulating the quanti- 
ties by the shade you wish to obtain. Flaxen gray 
is obtained by a mixture of white lead and Prussian 

blue, with a small quantity of lake. Brick colour. 

Yellow ochre and red lead, with a little white. Oak- 
wood colour.— I white lead, and i part umber and 
yellow ochre : the proportions of the last two ingre- 
dients being determined by the required tints. 
Walnut-tree colour.—^ white lead, and J red ochre, 
yellow ochre, and umber, mixed according to the 
shade sought. If veining is required, use different 
shades of the same mixture, and for the deepest 
places, black. Jonquil.— Yq\\o\y, pink, and white 
lead. This colour is only proper for distemper. 
Lemon yellow.— RealgsiY and orpiment. Some object 
to this mixture on account of the poisonous nature 
of the ingredients. The same colour can be ob- 
tained by mixing yellow pink with :N"aples yellow; 
but it is then only fit for distemper. Orange colour.— 
Red lead and yellow ochre. Violet colour. Ver- 
milion, or red lead, mixed with black or blue, and a 
small portion of white. Vermilion is far preferable 
to red lead, in mixing this colour. Purple.— Dark 
red mixed with violet-colour. Carnaiion.—L'dke and 
white. Gold colour.— Massicot or :N"aples yellow, 
with a small quantity of realgar, and a very little 
Spanish white. Olive colour,— This may be obtained

by various mixtures : black, and a little blue, mixed 
with yellow ; yellow pink, with a little verdigris and 
lampblack ; or ochre and a small quantity of white, 
will also produce a kind of olive colour. For dis- 
temper, indigo and yellow pink, mixed with white 
lead or Spanish white, must be used. If veined, it 
should be done with umber. Lead colour. — Indigo

for a dark chestnut. To make it lighter, employ a 
mixture of yellow ochre. Light timber colour. — 
Spruce ochre, white, and a little umber. Flesh 
colour. — Lake, white lead, and a little vermilion. 
Light Wilhw-green. — White, mixed with verdigris. 
Grass-green. — Yellow pink mixed with verdigris. 
An endless variety of greens can be obtained by the 
mixture of blue and yellow in different proportions, 
with the occasional addition of white lead. Stone 
colour. — White, with a little spruce ochre. Dark 
Lead colour. — Black and white, with a little indigo. 
Fawn colour. — White lead, stone ochre, and a little 
vermilion. Chocolate colour. — Lampblack and Span- 
ish brown. On account of the fatness of the lamp- 
black, mix some litharge and red lead. Portland 
Stone colour. — Umber, yellow ochre, and white lead. 
The varieties of shades of brown that may be ob- 
tained are nearly as numerous as those of green. 
To imitate Mahogany. — Let the first coat of painting 
be white lead, the second orange, and the last burned 
umber or sienna; imitating the veins according to 
your taste and practice. To imitate Wainscot. — Let 
the first coat be white, the second half white and 
half yellow ochre, and the third yellow ochre only.

Names of the different Colours used in Painting. 

Whites. — White Lead^ Ceruse, and Flake. — The more 
common sorts are called white lead ; the purer, ce- 
ruse ; the very best, flake-white. The white colours 
are generally used in house-painting. 

Spanish or Bougival White is generally sold in cakes 
of an oblong form. It is much better for house- 
painting than any whites that contain a mixture of 
chalky substances, and it is not unfrequently used 
instead of white lead for priming, being far cheaper, 
though much less durable. 

Gypsum, or Plaster of Paris, — When employed in 
house-painting, it requires to be mixed with a great 
quantity of water, and it then forms a very valuable 
article for white- washing apartments, and for paint- 
ing in distemper. 

White of Troyes, or White Chalk. — It is generally 
used for common white-washing, though gypsum is 
much preferable for this purpose. 

Blacks. — Ivory-Black is extremely rich and intense 
in colour ; but, being costly, it is seldom employed 
in common work. 

Lamp-Black is used more than any other black 
in common painting. 

Charcoal- Black. — The woods that furnish the best 
charcoal for painters are the beech and vine ; the 
former yielding a black of a bluish cast, and the 
latter one of a grayish cast. When charcoal ob- 
tained from any of these sources is employed in 



112 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

painting, it should be mixed with a very small 
portion of white lead, and made up for use with 
drying-oil. 

Beds. — Vermilion is the most brilliant of all the 
light reds. The body of vermilion is very delicate, 
and will grind as fine as oil itself. No colour looks 
better, works smoother, bears a better body, or goes 
farther. 

Minium, or Bed Lead. — When it is well ground 
and made fine, it is lighter than any other red in 
general use, bears a good body in oil, and binds 
very fast and firm. It has likewise the advantage 
of drying readily. 

Carmine is a more dazzling red than vermilion, 
and is almost too brilliant for the eye to endure. 
There are various sorts of carmine, numbered in the 
order of their relative value. Thus, ]^o. 1 is the 
best ; 1^0. 2 the second best ; and so on. 

Lake. — There are two sorts of colours known 
under this name : lakes derived from cochineal, — the 
richest and finest of all dark reds; and lakes pre-- 
pared from madder, — not quite so good. 

Spanish Brown. — The deeper the colour, and the 
freer from gritty particles, the better it is for use. 
It is much employed by painters for priming or first 
colour. 

Other Beds. — Besides the above reds may be men- 
tioned, as among those in use by painters, English 
red and Prussian red ; red ochre, which is very ex- 
tensively used, especially in distemper ; rose-colour, 
composed of a portion of white lead mixed with pure 
lake ; and realgar. 

Yellow Ochre. — Of this colour there are two kinds, 
the bright yellow and dark yellow. The former is 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 113 

Bometimes called plain ochre, and the latter spruce 
ochre. It will grind vary fine, resists the weather 
well, and bears a good body. 

Massicot is a good light yellow for general use, 
and very serviceable, mixed with blue, for making 
greens. 

Chrome Yellow is a very rich and brilliant yellow, 
and employed to advantage in house and coach 
painting. 

Turner's, or Patent, Yelloio. — It is a very beautiful 
colour, much in use among coach-painters. 

Orjnment. — It is good for some purposes, particu- 
larly for the production of straw-colour in painting 
doors, windows, &c. It likewise, in common with 
all bodies that contain arsenic, produces a bad eiiect 
on any metallic substance exposed to its action. . 

Naples Yelloio, — The best of all yellows. It is 
milder and more unctuous than either orpiment, 
massicot, or any of the ochres. It is necessary to 
use it with great care. It must be ground well on a 
slab of porphyry or marble, and scraped together 
with an ivory knife, as both stone and steel have a 
tendency to turn it to green. 

Yellow of Antimony. — It holds an intermediate 
place between chrome yellow and ITaples yellow. 
It is chiefly used for giving a yellow colour to glass 
and earthenware. 

Yellow Pink. — It grinds and dissolves in water 
easily ; but care must be taken not to bring it in con- 
tact with iron, as the astringent principle which it 
contains in abundance instantly dissolves that metal, 
which in its turn destroys the clearness of the colour. 

Prussian Blue. — There are blue colours superior 
to this, both in clearness and durability, but none 



114 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

which, volume for volume, contains so large a quan- 
tity of colouring- matter. A practical colourman says 
that it contains even ten to one more than any other 
colouring-matter. It is, on this account, much used 
in house-painting, and also in colouring paper- 
hangings. 

Indigo. — Another hlue colour, much used in com- 
mon painting. I^one but the best and purest kind 
of this colour is proper for oil-painting : that of an 
inferior quality is only fit for distemper, as the oil 
renders it black or green. Indigo grinds fine, and 
bears a very good body. Its natural colour, how- 
ever, being very dark, almost indeed approaching to 
black, it is seldom or never used without a small 
mixture of white. 

Ultramarine is the richest, mellowest, most beauti- 
ful, and lasting of all blues ; but its extravagant price 
— nearly equal, when pure, to its weight in gold — 
prevents its being introduced, unless very rarely 
indeed, into house-painting. 

Sraalt, Zaffre, Azure, Saxon Blue, or Enamel Blue. — 
It is of a lovely azure hue, but, if not bought in the 
form of powder, is very difiicult to grind, and it can 
be used only in a peculiar manner. 

Blue Verditer,—l^h\^ is a beautiful blue, obtained 
from the waste nitrate of copper of the refiners by 
adding to it a quantity of chalk ; but it is only proper 
for distemper: it does not admit of being used with 
oil, unless a considerable mixture of white is intro- 
duced. 

Greens. — Verdigris. — This is the best simple 
green, and the one most in use. It has a bluish 
tint, but, Avhen lightened by the addition of a little 
yellow pink, it makes a beautiful grass-green. It 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 115 

grinds very line, and works easily, and in a good 
body. When delicate painting is required, the 
dross mixed with the common verdigris makes it 
improper, and it becomes necessary to use distilled 
verdigris, which can be had at the shops, and is free 
from all impurities ; but it is too expensive for ordi- 
nary purposes. 

Italian, or Verona, Green.— It is of the same colour 
as chlorine, which derives its name from the Greek 
w^ord chloros, signifying a yellowish green. It is 
very durable, and not acted on by acids, but, being 
obtained from an earth, does not incorporate well 

with oil. 

Saxon, or Hungary, Green.— T\\q colour which bears 
this name is a carbonate of copper, found in a natural 
state, in the mountains of Saxony and Hungary, 
mixed with earthy matters, which give it a polish 

hue. 

Scheele's Green.— Th\Q colour, called after the cele- 
brated chemist by whom its composition was first 
made known, is of a light sea-green colour. It 
grinds well with oil, and is much in request for the 
painting of cabins. of ships. 

Schweinfiiri Green.— A green which has recently 
obtained great reputation on the continent, and 
which is said to surpass Scheele's both in beauty 
and splendour. 

Brunswick Green.— A colour thus named is much 
used for paper-hangings and coarse kind of painting 
water-colours. 

Green Verditer.— This is obtained from the same 
substance as blue verditer, by a process nearly simi- 
lar. Without the addition of white lead or Spanish 
white it is unfit for oil-painting ; and, in any way, it 



116 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

is better adapted for distemper. Its colour may be 
obtained in oil by mixing two or three parts of ver- 
digris with one of white lead. 

Green Lake, or Venetian Emerald. — A very simple 
mode has recently been discovered, at Venice, of pro- 
ducing a fine unchangeable emerald colour. A quan- 
tity of cofiee is boiled in river- water, — if spoiled cof- 
fee, so much the better. The green lake obtained 
by this process is said to have resisted the action of 
acids, and even the influence of light and moisture. 

Browns. — Umber, or, as it is sometimes called, 
brown ochre, is an impure native oxide of iron and 
manganese. It is much employed by painters, and 
is the only simple brown in common use. 

New Brown, discovered by Mr. Hatchet. This 
celebrated chemist has suggested to painters that a 
simple brown colour, far superior in beauty and 
intensity to all the browns, whether simple or com- 
pound, hitherto known, may be obtained from the 
prussiate of copper, (a combination of prussic acid 
with copper.) The following is the process which he 
recommends : — 

Dissolve the green muriate of copper in about ten 
times its weight of distilled or rain water, and add a 
solution of prussiate of lime, until a complete pre- 
cipitation is efiected. The precipitate is then to be 
washed with cold water, filtered, and set to dry in 
the shade.

Of different Oils used in Painting and Varnishing. 

Oil of Sjnke is, if pure, a volatile oil, and has the 
advantage of drying more quickly than any other 
fat- oil. 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. llT 

Oil of Lavender. — Its property of drying more 
equally and gradually than perhaps any other oil 
renders it also of service to the varnisher. It is also 
used by enamellers, to whom it is very valuable. 

Oil of Poppies is, that of being perfectly colourless. 
The only objection is of being insufferably tedious in 
drying. 

Nut and Linseed Oils. — Both in very general use, 
and rank among the fat-oils. Their fatness, indeed, 
is so great, that it is mostly found necessary, before 
employing them in colouring, to give them a drying 
quality, which may be done in the following man- 
ner: — 

Take 1 pound white vitriol and 4 pounds litharge, 
and let them be reduced to as line a powder as pos- 
sible ; then mix them with 1 gallon nut or linseed 
oil, and place the mixture over a fire just brisk 
enough to keep the oil slightly boiling. Let it con- 
tinue to boil till the oil entirely ceases to throw up 
anv scum. Then take the vessel off the fire, and let 
it stand in a cool place for about three hours, and a 
sediment, which contains the fattening part of the 
oil, will be formed at the bottom. Pour off" the oil 
which is above (being careful not to let any of the 
sediment mix with it) into wide-mouthed bottles. 

Let it remain a sufiicient time to clear itself per- 
fectly before it is used, and you will find it possessed 
of the proper drying quality. 

Oil of Turpentine is more used than anj^ of the pre- 
ceding oils : the varnisher, indeed, scarcely employs 
any other. Fat-oils are oftentimes ntixed with oil 
of turpentine, as well as other volatile oils. Drying 
oils, which are composed of particular substances 
'mixed with some of the oils before mentioned, are 



118 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

useful for several purposes. They are most valuable 
when so manufactured as to be colourless. They 
are much used in preparing varnishes, and, in oil- 
painting, are not unfrequently employed as a var- 
nish, either alone or diluted with a little oil of tur- 
pentine.

How to make Copal Varnish. No. 1. 

The foundation of all varnishes are gummy and 
resinous substances, and the only liquids that can 
be combined with them, so as to form varnishes, are 
oils, spirits of turpentine, and spirits of wine. 

To make copal varnish: Take 22 ounces gum 
copal, (good and clear,) and dissolve it in a proper 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 119 

copper vessel. As soon as it is properly dissolved, 
add 1 pint of the prepared linseed-oil. (See No. 228.) 
When well incorporated, take it oiF the fire, let it 
cool off a little, add nearly 1 quart spirits of tur- 
pentine, mix it thoroughly, and strain through flan- 
nel. Let it stand 5 or 6 days, when it will be fit 
for use.

Another Copal Varnish. No. 2. 

Take 1 ounce copal, and J ounce shellac; powder 
them well, and put them into a bottle or jar contain-

in a warm place, and shake it occasionally, till you 
perceive that the gums are completely dissolved; 
and when strained the varnish will be fit for use.

Gold- Coloured Copal Varnish. 

Take 1 ounce powdered copal, 2 ounces essential 
oil of lavender, and 6 ounces essence of turpentine. 
Put the oil of lavender into a matrass of a proper 
size, placed on a sand-bath subject to a moderate 
heat. When the oil is very warm, add the copal 
from time to time, in very small quantities, and stir 
the mixture with a stick of white wood rounded at 
the end. When the copal has entirely disappeared, 
put in the turpentine in almost a boiling state, at 
three different times, and keep continually stirring 
the mixture till the solution is quite complete.

Seed-Lac Varnish. 

Take 3 ounces seed-lac, and put it, with a pint of 
spirits of wine, into a bottle of which it will not fill 
more than two-thirds. Shake the mixture well 
together, and place it in a gentle heat till the seed- 
lac appears to be dissolved : the solution will be 
hastened by shaking the bottle occasionally. After 
it has stood some time, pour off the clear part, and 
keep it for use in a well-stopped bottle. The seed- 
lac should be purified before it is used, by washing 
it in cold water; and it should be in coarse powder 
when added to the spirit. 

This varnish is next to that of copal in hardness, 
and has a reddish-yellow colour : it is, therefore, 
only to be used where a tinge of that kind is not 
injurious. 

No. 234. 

Shell'Lae Varnish, 

Take 5 ounces of the best shell-lac, reduce it to a 
gross powder, and put it into a bottle in a gentle 
heat, or a warm, close apartment, where it must 
continue 2 or 3 days, but should be frequently 
well shaken. The lac will then be dissolved, and 
the solution should then be filtered through a flannel 
bag ; and, when the portion that will pass through 
freely is come off, it should be kept for use in well- 
stopped bottles. 

The portion which can only be made to pass 
through the bag by pressure may be reserved for 
coarse purposes. Shell-lac varnish is rather softer 
than seed-lac varnish, but is the best of varnishes

oil of lavender, 6 pounds sheep's tallow, (suet :) melt 
and mix over a gentle fire, when it will be ready for 
use, and be put up in tin boxes. 

Directions. — Let your leather be clean and damp 
when the blacking is applied, and allow time to dry 
moderately before wearing. Apply it plentifully at 
first, with a brush or otherwise, until the leather is 
filled with it: after that, a little occasionally will 
answer. One box, used with economy, will be sufli- 
cient to last one person a year. 

Directions. — For carriage-tops and harness. Mix 
about a pint of oil (fish or tanners') to a box, by 
warming it well. Have your leather clean and 
damp before you apply it. 

N.B. — Leather that this is applied to will not 
mould, — which, every one knows, is very injurious to 
leather. 

This blacking will not produce a polish, but will 
make the leather soft, water-proof, and much more 
durable. Polish-blacking can be used immediately 
and produce a fine polish.

How Comrpound Spirits of Cordials for bevcrarjc is 

vianyfacturcd. 

Tlic perfection of tliis grand branch of manufac- 
turing depends upon the observation of the follow- 
ing general rules, which are easy to be observed 
and practised. First, The manufacturer must always 
be careful to use a well-cleansed spirit, or one freed 
from its own essential oils. For, as a compound 
cordial is nothing more than a spirit impregnated 
with the essential oil of the ingredients, it is neces- 
sary that the spirit should have deposited its own. 
Second, Let the time of previous digestion be pro- 
portioned to the tenacity of the ingredients, or the 
ponderosity of the oil. Third, Have a due propor- 
tion of spirits, the grosser and less fragrant parts of 
the oil not giving the spirit so agreeable a flavour, 
and at the same time rendering it thick and un- 
sightly. This may, in a great measure, be effected 
by leaving out the feints, and making up to proof 
with fine soft water in their stead. 

It is sonletimes necessary to filter cordials. This 
may be done by letting it run through some proper 
cloth. If fining should be necessary, it may be 
done by adding from 5 to 7 eggs to the barrel. A 
syrup is made by taking the best white sugar. Take 
8 pounds loaf sugar, 2 quarts water. Dissolve the 
sugar in the water on a gentle fire, and remove the 
scum as it rises; as soon as it commences boiling, 
take it from the fire, and strain it immediately. 
This is called by the art simple syrup, and is used 
in the manufacture of many kinds of liquors.

How to make Cider. 
After the apples are gathered from the trees, they 
are ground into what is called pomace, or pulp, 
either by means of a common pressing-stone, with a 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUAULK RECEIPTS. 131 

circular trough, or l)y a cider-mill, which is cither 
driven by hand or by horse power. Wlien the pulp 
is thus reduced to a great degree oi' fineness, it is 
conveyed to the cider-jjrea.s, where it is formed by 
pressure into a kind of cake, which is called the 
cheese. 

This is effected by placing clean sweet straw or 
hair-cloth between the layers of pomace or pulp, 
till there is a pile of 8 or 10 to 12 layers. This pile 
is then subjected to different degrees of pressure in 
succession, till all the must or juice is squeezed 
from the pomace. This juice, after being strained 
in a coarse hair sieve, is then put either into open 
vats or close casks, and the pressed pulp is either 
thrown away or made to yield a weak liquor, called 
washings, or, as we call it, water-cider. 

After the liquor has undergone the proper fer- 
mentation in these close vessels, which may be best 
effected in a temperature of from 40 to GO degrees of 
Fahrenheit, and which niaybe known by its appear- 
ing tolerably clear, and having a vinous sharpness 
upon the tongue, any further fermentation must bo 
stopped by racking off' the pure part int(^open vessels 
exposed for a day or two in a cool situation. After 
this, the liquor must again be put into casks, and 
kept in a cool x>lace during winter. The proper 
time for racking may always be best known by the 
brightness of the liquor, the discharge of the fixed 
air, and the appearance of a thick crust formed of 
fragments of the reduced pulp. The liquor should 
always be racked off' anew as often as a hissing 
noise is heard, or as it extinguishes a candle held to 
the bung-hole. 



132 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

When a favourable vinous fermentation has been 
obtained, nothing more is required than to fill up 
the vessels every 2 or 3 weeks, to supply the 
waste by fermentation. In the beginning of March 
the liquor will be bright and pure, and fit for final 
racking, which should be done in fair weather. 
When the bottles are filled they should be set by

How to manage Cider, 

To fine and improve the flavour of 1 hogshead, 
take a gallon good French brandy, with J ounce 
cochineal, 1 pound alum, and 3 pounds rock-candy ; 
bruise them all well in a mortar, and infuse them in 
the brandy for a day or two ; then mix the whole 
with the cider, and stop it close for 5 or 6 months. 
After which, if fine, bottle it off. 

Cider, when bottled in hot weather, should be left 
a day or twa uncorked, that it may get flat ; but if 
too flat in the cask, and soon wanted for use, put 
into each bottle a small lump or two of rock-candy, 
4 or 5 raisins of the sun, or a small piece of raw 
beef; any of which will much improve the liquor, 
and make it brisker. 

Cider should be well corked and waxed, and 
packed upright in a cool place. A few bottles may 
be kept in a warmer place, to ripen and be ready for 
use.

stand 10 days. Then rack it off into another clean 
cask, which has a brass cock in it, and in 4 or 5 
days' time it will be fit for bottling. When it has 
been in the bottles 7 or 8 days, it will be fit for use. 
A little colouring should be added when putting 
into the cask the second time. The raisins may 
afterwards be used for vinegar.

Observations on Cider. 

From the great diversity of soil and climate in the 
United States of America, and the almost endless 
variety of its apples, it follows that much diversity 
of taste and flavour will necessarily be found in the 
cider that is made from them. 

To make good cider, the following general, but 
important, rules should be attended to. They de- 
mand a little more trouble than the ordinary mode 
of collecting and mashing apples of all sorts, rotten 
and sound, sweet and sour, dirty and clean, from the 
tree and the soil, and the rest of the slovenly process 
usually employed ; but in return they produce you 
a wholesome, high-flavoured, sound, and palatable 
liquor, that always commands an adequate price,

instead of a solution of "villanous compounds," in 
a poisonous and acid wash, that no man in his senses 
will drink. The finest cider was made of an equal 
portion of ripe, sound pippin and crab apples, pared, 
cored, and pressed, etc., with the utmost nicet3^ It 
was equal in flavour to any champagne that ever 
was made. 

No. 266. 

General Hides for making Cider. 

1. Always choose perfectly ripe and sound apples. 
2. Pick the apples by hand. An active boy, with a 
bag slung over his shoulders, will soon clear a tree. 
Apples that have lain any time on the soil contract 
an earthy taste, which will always be found in the 
cider. 3. After sweating, and before being ground, 
wipe them dry, and if any of them are found bruised 
or rotten, put them in a heap by themselves, for an 
inferior cider to make vinegar. 4. Always use hair 
cloth, instead of straw, to place between the layers 
of pomace. The straw when heated gives a dis- 
agreeable taste to the cider, 5. As the cider runs 
from the press, let it pass through a hair sieve into 
a large open vessel, that will hold as much juice as 
can be expressed in one day. In a day, and some- 
times less, the pomace will rise to the top, and in a 
short time grow very thick ; when little white bubbles 
break through it, draw off the liquor by a spigot, 
placed about three inches from the bottom, so that 
the lees may be left quietly behind. 6. The cider 
must be drawn oiFinto very clean casks, and closely 
watched. The moment the white bnbbles before 
mentioned are perceived rising at the bung-hole, 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 135 

rack it again. When the fermentation is com- 
pletely at an end, fill up the cask with cider in all 
respects like that already contained in it, and bung 
it up tight; previous to which a tumblerful of sweet 
oil may be poured into the bung-hole. Sound, well- 
made cider, that has been produced as described, 
and without any foreign mixtures, excepting always 
that of good cognac brandy, (which, added to it in 
the proportion of 1 gallon to every 30, greatly im- 
proves it,) is a pleasant, cooling drink, and useful 
beverage. 

Cider prepared as above is generally used to imi- 
tate the different kinds of wine. 



No. 267. 

Another Bulefor making good Cider, 

In grinding the apples, reduce the whole fruit to a 
uniform pomace. Allow the pulp to remain from 
2 to 6 or 8 days ; if warm weather, for a shorter time, 
and if cold, a longer time, according to the state of 
the weather, stirring it every day, until put to the 
press. If there should be any wanting of the sac- 
charine matter, add sugar before fermentation takes 
place, and after fermentation add spirits of wine. 
After the liquor has remained a few days, (after its 
having been strained through a sieve,) taking off the 
scum as it rises, then draw it off* into casks, and 
place in a cool cellar; or let it be, a short time after 
the pressing, placed in a cool place, put into strong, 
light casks, and after the pomace has all overflown, 
drive the bung close, and bore with a gimlet a hole 
through the bung, and put in a spile to draw, when 
the cask appears to be in danger of bursting.

How to keep common Cider good for years. 

Take the cider when you think it will suit your 
taste, put it into a kettle, and boil it very little. 
Make a bag and put into it \ pound of hops, then 
put the bag with hops into the kettle with the cider, 
and tie it fast to the handle so that the bag with hops 
will not touch the bottom of the kettle ; scum off the 
cider while you have it on the fire, and after it has 
boiled a short time take it oif the fire, and let it cool 
down lukewarm ; put it into a good sweet barrel, 
and add 1 pint good fresh brandy, bung it up, and it 
will keep the same as you put it into your barrel for 
years. 

No. 269. 

Another way to keep Cider. 

Take cider after it is taken from the press, or when 
it suits your taste, and put it into a good, strong, tight, 
sweet barrel, and add 3 gallons apple whiskey, and 
6 cents' worth mustard-seed, and bung it up tight, 
and let it ferment in the barrel ; bore a gimlet-hole 
through the bung, and put a spile into it, so that you 
can let some of the gas out, to prevent the cask from 
bursting. When the fermentation is subsided, draw 
it off clear, and clean out your barrel, and put the 
cider in again, and bung it up close.

and bore one of the heads full of J inch holes, 
J inch apart, so that it appears like a sieve, or 
riddle ; when this is done, take the perforated 
bottom out, and sink down into the barrel within 
2 inches of the lower bottom ; first nail 3 or 4 strips 
of wood, 2 inches thick, to answer for legs, (so that 
there will be an empty space of 2 inches between 
the two bottoms,) to rest the second bottom on, 
between which you will have to bore a hole through 
the side, to put in a brass or wooden spigot, between 
the empty space of the two bottoms, to draw out the 
rectified liquor, which, if the rectifier is good, should 
not run out faster than the thickness of a middle- 
sized knitting-needle, or still less ; and after you 
have the perforated bottom at its proper place, put 
a layer of flannel or blanket over this bottom, so 
that it will come all round up the sides a little ; now 
take some fine, clean sand, and put from 4 to 6 
inches on the flannel or blanket; now put another 
layer of flannel on the sand, and on the top of this 
put from 12 to 15 inches of the prepared cliarcoal, 
and on the top of this put another layer of blanket 
or flannel ; on the top of this flannel lay 4 or 6 bricks, 
to keep the flannel down, or else if you pour in yotir

liquor it would rise on the top of the liquor ; now 
your stand is ready to receive the liquor you wish to 
purify. This stand is capable to rectify 10 barrels 
of strong whiskey, when the coal will be worn out ; 
and when the coals are worn out, renew them, the 
same as before. Observe, there will be left a great 
deal of strength in the coal after it stops running; 
to get that strength out, pour water on and let water 
through, until no strength of the liquor remains in 
it. To ascertain this, a hydrometer is indispensably 
necessary to try the liquor ; by this mode you can 
find how many degrees of spirits you have in the 
water. These spirits can be used for liquor that is 
over proof, to bring it down to proof. 

You may put up as many stands as you wish, of 
the same size, or make them as large as you please. 
Some rectifiers put up two, one above the other, and 
let the whiskey through them both ; and if you want 
your spirits very fine, you can let it run through 3 or 
4 times ; the oftener, the finer your spirits gets. 
Keep your rectifier always in use, or the coal will 
become mouldy and unfit for use. 

The charcoal ought to be prepared from sugar 
maple wood. Some rectifiers use raw cotton, or 
straw, instead of flannel, and put between the sand 
and charcoal, malt, or lime, according to fancy. 



Hecajpitulation of Directions in jputting up a Rectifying 

Stand. 

1. Take a good, tight barrel, or any other good 
cask. 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 131? 

2. Bore holes through one of the heads, as 
descrihed. 

3. Take out the head and sink it down within 2 
inches of the bottom. 

4. Cover with a layer of flannel this perforated 
bottom. 

5. Put 4 to 6 inches washed sand on the top of 
the flannel. 

6. Put another layer of flannel on the top of the 
sand. 

7. Put 12 or 15 inches of charcoal on the top of 
the flannel. 

8. Put another layer of flannel on the coal. 

9. Put 4 or 6 bricks on the flannel, to keep it from 
rising up to the top. 

10. Keep the stand, after you have poured liquor 
on, well covered. 

The spirituous liquor which is rectified thus is 
called pure spirits or sweet liquors, and is flavoured 
for wines, brandies, spirits, rum, Monongahela whis- 
key, cordials, etc., and should be clear of all foreign 
matter.

colour, brilliancy, richness, and flavour, — and is per- 
formed by drawing off the wine and leaving the 
sediment in the cask. A siphon should be used ; 
but, if not, the cask should be tapped 2 or 3 days 
previously. It may be racked off* into another cask 
again, after it has been well cleaned; and, if re- 
quisite, the cask may be slightly fumigated, imme- 
diately before the wine is returned into it. If the 
wine, on being tasted, is found weak, a little spirits 
to be given to it, Jthe cask filled up, and bunged 
tight. The racking off* ought to be performed in 
temperate weather; and, as soon as the wines 
appear clear, a second racking will make them per- 
fectly brilliant ; and, if so, they will want no fining.

How to fine or clear Wine. 

One of the best finings is as follows : Take 1 
pound fresh marshmallow-roots, washed clean, and 
cut into small pieces ; macerate them in 2 quarts of 
soft water for 24 hours, then gently boil the liquor 
down to 3 half-pints, strain it, and, when cold, mix 
with J ounce pipe-clay or chalk in powder; then 
pour the mucilage into the cask, and stir up the 
wine, so as not to disturb the sediment or lees, and 
leave the vent-peg out for some days after. 

Or, take boiled rice, 2 tablespoonfuls, the white 
of 1 new Q^g^ and \ ounce burnt alum in powder. 
Mix with a pint or more of the wine, then pour the 
mucilage into the cask, and stir the wine with a 
stout stick, but not to ao^itate the sediment or lees. 

Or, dissolve, in a gentle heat, \ ounce isinglass in

a pint or more of tlie wine ; then mix with it J 
ounce chalk in powder. When the two are well 
incorporated, pour it into the cask, and stir the 
wine, so as not to disturb the sediment or lees. As 
soon as the wines are clear and bright, after being 
fined down, they ought to be racked into a sweet 
and clean cask, — the cask to be filled up and bunged 
tight.

How the Bottling of Wine is performed. 

Fine clear weather is best for bottling all sorts of 
wines ; and much cleanliness is required. The first 
consideration in bottling wines is to examine and 
see if the wines are in a proper state. The wines 
should be fine and brilliant, or they will never 
brighten after. White wines, before being bottled, 
must go through the process of fining. For 1 hogs- 
head, (or any quantity in proportion, more or less,) 
take 2 ounces isinglass, and dissolve it in 1 quart 
water, and mix with 2 quarts of the wine. Eed 
wines are fined by beating to a froth the white of 7 
eggs, and mixing them with 3 times the bulk of 
water ; then, adding 2 quarts of the wine, mix well, 
and pour it into 1 barrel of your wine. 

The bottles must be all sound, clean, and dry, 
with plenty of good, sound corks. 

The cork is to be put in with the hand, and 
driven well in with a flat wooden mallet, the weight 
of which ought to be 1\ pounds, but, however, not 
to exceed 1\ pounds ; for, if the mallet be too light 
or too heavy, it will not drive the cork in properly, 
and may break the bottle. The corks must so com- 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 159 

plctcly fill up tlic neck of each bottle as to render 
tlieni air-tight, but leave a space of an iucli between 
the wine and tlie cork. 

When all the wine is bottled, it is to be stored in 
a cool cellar, and on no account on the bottles' 
bottoms, but on their sides, and in sawdust.

How to make Currant Wine. 

To every quart of currant-juice, add 3 pounds 
sugar and 3 quarts water. Put all together into your 
cask, (be careful to take such a cask that you can 
fill up to the bung-hole. Should it not quite fill 
up your cask, add a little water until it is full.) 
When your cask is full, leave the bung out, and lay 
thin gauze or bobinet over the bung-hole, to keep 
the flies out; let it ferment until it stops. After 
fermentation, draw it off, and clean out your cask 
very clean ; return the liquor, bung your cask up 
tight, and it will be fit for use in 3 or 4 months. 
If you wish, you can add 1 quart brandy to every 
10 gallons before you bung it up tight.

the above principle: Morelle jerries, sour jerries, 
blackberries, elderberries, raspberries, strawberries,

To cure Wounds in Cattle. ,i{ rjiuajiiaM 

. When horses, cattle, or any of our domestic 
animals are wounded, the treatment may be very 
simple, and much the same as with the human race. 
It is extremely improper to follow a practice that is 
common in many parts of the country among far- 
riers, cow-doctors, and even shepherds, — that of ap- 
plying to the wound, or putting into the sore part, 
common salt, powder of blue vitriol, or tar, or cloths 
dipped in spirits, as brand}^, rum, &c., or turpentine, 
or any other stimulant articles ; for all such very 
much increase the pain, and by irritating the sore 
may increase the inflammation even to the length 
of inducing mortification. Though the treatment 
may be varied according to circumstances, yet, in 
most cases, it may be sufficient to take notice of the 
following particulars : — It will be proper to wash 
away any foulness or dirt about the part, and to 
examine particularly its condition.

To stop the Bleeding. 

Should any large blood-vessel be cut, and dis- 
charging copiously, it will be right to stop it, by 
some lint or sponge, with moderate compression, or 
bandaging, at the same time, and not taking it off 
for 2 or 3 days. Should the pressure fail of 
effect, caustic applications, such as lunar-caustic, or 
even the actual cautery, the point of a thick wire 
sufficiently heated, may be tried; or, if a surgeon 
be at hand, the vessel may be taken up by a crooked 
needle, with waxed thread, and then tied. 



No. 354. 

Adhesive Plaster and Sewing. 

"When there is no danger of excessive bleeding, 
and a mere division of the parts, or a deep gash or 
cut, it will be right to adjust the parts, and keep 
them together by a strip of any common adhesive 
plaster ; or, when this will not do by itself, the lips 
of the wound, especially if it be a clean cut, maybe 
closed by one or more stitches with a moderately 
coarse needle and thread, which, in each stitch, may 
be tied, and the ends left of a moderate length, so 
that they can be afterwards removed when the parts 
adhere. It is advisable to tie the threads, because 
sometimes the wounded part swells so much that it 
is difficult to get them cut and drawn out without 
giving pain and doing some mischief. 



166 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 



No. 355. 

Bandages, 

If the part will allow a roller or bandage to be 
used to keep the lips of it together, this may like- 
wise be employed ; for, by supporting the sides of 
the wound, it would lessen any pain which the 
stitches occasion. With this treatment the wound 
heals often in a short time, or in a few days, rarely 
exceeding 5 or 6, and sooner in the young and 
healthy than in the old and relaxed, and sooner in 
the quiet and motionless than in the restless and 
active. 

Should the wound be large, and inflammation, 
with the discharge of matter, likely to take place, it 
ma}^ still be proper, by gentle means, to bring the 
divided parts near to each other, and to retain them 
in their natural situation by means of a bandage. 
This should not be made too tight, but merely to 
support the part. In this way, and by avoiding 
stimulant applications, the wound will heal more 
readily than otherwise, and the. chance of any 
blemish following will be diminished. Washes of 
spirits, brandy, and the like, " Friar's balsam," 
spirits of wine and camphor, turpentine, or any 
other irritating applications, are highly improper, 
and sometimes make a fresh clean wound (that 
would readily heal almost of itself) inflame and 
perhaps mortify, or become a bad sore.

Sores and Bruises. 

Over the whole sore, or where the part is bruised, 
or where there is a tendency to suppuration, a poul- 
tice should be applied and kept on by suitable band- 
ages. The poultice may be made of any kind of 
meal, fine bran, bruised linseed, or of mashed turnips, 
carrots, &c. The following has been found useful as 
a common poultice. " Fine bran, 1 quart ; pour on it 
a sufficient quantity of boiling water to make a thin 
paste ; to this add linseed-powder enough to give it 
a proper consistence." The poultice may be kept on 
for a week or 10 days, or even longer, if necessary, 
changing it once or twice a day; and clean the 
wound w^hen the poultice is removed, by washing it 
by means of a soft rag or linen cloth with water not 
more than blood-warm, (some sponges are too rough 
for this purpose ;) or, where the wound is deep, the 
water may be injected into it by a syringe, in order 
to clean it from the bottom. 

No. 357. 

Ointment, 

In the course of a few days, when the wound, by 
care and proper management with the poultices, 
begins to put on a healthy appearance, and seems 
to be clean and of a reddish colour, not black or 
bloody, then there may be applied an ointment 
made of tallow, linseed-oil, beeswax, and hog's lard, 
in such proportion as to make it of a consistence 
somewhat firmer than butter. The ointment should 
be spread on some soft clean tow ; and when applied 



168 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

to the sore, it ought never to be tied hard upon it, 
(which is done too frequently, and very improperly,) 
but only fixed by a bandage of a proper length, (for 
a mere cord is often improper,) so close and se- 
curely as to keep it from slipping off. This appli- 
cation may be changed once a day ; or, when nearly 
well, and discharging but little, once in 2 days.

Green Ointment for Wounds,

stirring it all the time with a clean stick or w^ooden 
spatula. When all is well mixed, stir in 1 ounce 
finely-powdered verdigris. Be careful that it does 
not boil over ; strain it through a coarse cloth, and 
preserve it in a gallipot. This ointment is very 
good for old and recent w^ounds, whether in flesh or 
hoof, — also galled backs, cracked heels, mallender,

Treatment, according to appearance of the part. 

When the wounded part begins to discharge a 
whitish, thick matter, and is observed to fill up, the 
general treatment and dressings to the sore, now 
mentioned, should be continued ; and, in the course 
of the cure, the animal, when free of fever, may be 
allowed better provision, and may take gentle exer- 
cise. If the animal be feeble from the loss of blood 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 169 

originally, or from the long continuance of a feveriah 
state produced by the inflammation attending the 
wound, or from weakness arising from confinement, 
or connected with its constitution naturally, and 
if the wound appear to be in a stationary state, 
very pale and flabby on its edges, with a thin dis- 
charge, then better food may be given to it ; and, if 
still no change should be observed along with the 
better food, the wound may be treated somewhat 
difierently from what has been already advised. 
The ointment may be made more stimulant, by 
adding to it some rosin and less beeswax, — or, 
what would be more stimulant still, some common 
turpentine ; but it is only in very rare cases that oil 
of turpentine can be requisite. The eftects of an 
alteration in the mode of treatment should be par- 
ticularly remarked, and stimulants should be laid 
aside, continued, or increased according as may be 
judged proper. Before changing the dressings ap- 
plied to the wound, or before rendering them more 
stimulant and active by using heating applications, 
the eflfect of closer bandaging may be tried ; for, 
sometimes, by keeping the parts a little more firmly 
together the cure is promoted.

both. The apartment should be cool and airy, and 
so quiet that the animal should not be disturbed ; 
the drink should not be warm, but rather cold, and 
given freely, though not in too large quantities at a 
time ; the food should be sparingly given, and of a 
poorer quality than usual, and should be rather 
succulent and laxative than dry or apt to produce 
costiveness. Bleeding may be employed, either 
generally from a vein, or in some cases, when it can 
be done, by cupping from the hurt part, as in the 
case of a bruise, (though this last will seldom be 
requisite,) if found convenient; and it may be done 
more than once or twice, as may seem proper. 
Laxative medicines also ought to be given and re-

dangerous — disorder is of two kinds. The first, or

of dulness and uneasiness in the animal ; appetite 
diminished or totally gone ; constant pawing with 
the forefeet, frequently trying to kick the belly ; he

— countenance strongly expressive of pain; urine 
small, high-coloured, and voided with great pain ; 
pulse quick and small ; legs and ears cold ; profuse 
sweats ; mortification and death. 

The second species of the disorder is when the 
inflammation attacks the internal coat of the intes- 
tines, and is generally accompanied by a violent 
purging and some fever. The symptoms of the 
latter, however, are much less violent ; nor does the 
animal appear to be in so much pain. 

No. 373. 

Treatment 

In the first, or peritoneal, inflammation, the only 
dependence is on early and large bleedings. In 
addition to this, rub the whole belly well with the 
mustard embrocation, clothe the animal warmly, 
(with fresh sheepskins if possible,) insert several 
rowels about the chest and belly, — putting into them 
the blistering ointment. As the horse is generally 
costive, give him a pint of castor-oil, and inject 
clysters of warm flaxseed tea ; give him warm water, 
or thin gruel, or flaxseed tea, to drink ; rub his legs 
with the hands well, and see that he has plenty of 
clean fresh litter. If in six hours the disease is not 
relieved, bleed him again ; and should the costive- 
ness continue, repeat the oil and clysters. If, after 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 175 

giving all these remedies a faithful and continued 
trial, the pain should continue, recourse may be had 
to the anodyne clyster. 

In the second species of this disorder, bleeding 
need not be resorted to unless the febrile symptoms 
run high. Clothe the horse warmly, use the mus- 
tard embrocation freely, and omit the oil. Give 
him frequently, by means of a bottle, (if he will not 
drink it,) quantities of very thin gruel or flaxseed

dip a roll of tow or linen in tar, and bind it firmly 
over it. The whole foot is to be kept in a bran 
poultice for a few days, or until the lameness is

poultice ; if it suppurates, open the lump, let out 
the matter, and dress with the green ointment. If 
it is hard and indolent, apply strong mercurial oint- 
ment, to disperse it, and bleed moderately.

ening the parts frequently with a strong solution of 
Bal-ammoniac in vinegar may do some good.

Wounds. 

All the rules laid down iu this hook for the treat- 
ment of wounds in the human suhject apply strictly 
to horses. As in simple cuts, however, sticking- 
plaster cannot be used, the edges of the wound 
should be neatly stitched together. Much can be 
done also by the judicious application of bandages. 
Farriers generally are in the habit of pursuing such 
absurd, cruel, and fatal practices in these cases, 
either by cutting off a part that appears to be partly 
torn from its connection, or by using stimulating 
applications, that it becomes necessary to repeat 
again that all the rules laid down for the treatment 
of wounds in this work as applicable to man are 
equally so to the nobfe Animal of which we are 
speaking. Read over these rules, substitute the 
word ''horse" for "patient," and you will be at no 
loss how to proceed. 



No. 420. 

Bleeding in General. 

Bleeding is often the most useful and efficacious 
means of curing diseases in horses. In inflamma- 
tory affections, it is generally the first remedy re- 
sorted to; and its immediate salutary effects are 
often surprising. 

When it is necessary to lessen the whole quantity 
of blood in the system, open the jugular or neck 
vein. If the inflammation is local, bleed, where it can 
be conveniently done, either from the part affected 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 189 

or in its vicinity, as by opening the plate vein, super- 
ficial vein of the thigh, or temporal arteries. 

In fevers of all kinds, and when inflammation at- 
tacks any important organ, as the brain, eyes, lungs, 
stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, bladder, &c., 
bleeding is of the greatest use. It diminishes the 
quantity of blood in the body, and by this means 
prevents the bad consequences of inflammation. The 
quantity of blood to be taken varies according to 
the age, size, condition, and constitution of the 
horse, and the urgency of the symptoms. 

From a large, strong horse, 4 or 6 quarts will 
generally be requisite; and this may be repeated in 
smaller quantities if the symptoms demand it. The 
blood, in these diseases, must flow from a large 
orifice made in the vein. A horse should never be 
sufi'ered to bleed upon the ground, but into a measure, 
in order that the proper quantity may be taken. 
Horses have sometimes much constitutional irrita- 
tion, which bleeding relieves. But in these aft'ectious ' 
it is very rarely necessary to bleed to the same ex- 
tent as in fevers, &c. ; 2 or 3 quarts generally suflace 
to be taken away. 



No. 421. 

Fulness of Blood. 

Moderate bleeding, as from 2 to 4 quarts, is also 
used to remove fulness of habit, or plethora, attended 
with slight inflammatory symptoms. In this case the 
eyes appear heavy, dull, red, or inflamed, frequently 
closed as if asleep; the pulse small and oppressed; 
the heat of the body somewhat increased ; the legs 



190 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

swell, the hair also rubs off. Horses that are re- 
moved from grass to a warm stable, full fed on 
hay and corn, and not sufficiently exercised, are 
very subject to one or more of these symptoms. 
Regulating the quantity of food given to him, proper 
exercise, and occasional laxatives, as the following 
powder, will be commonly found sufficient after the 
first bleeding, and operation of an aloetic purge. In 
slight affections of this kind, a brisk purge will 
often alone be sufficient. 



No. 422. 

Laxative and Diaphoretic Powder. 

Take of crocus of antimony, finely levigated, nitre, 
cream of tartar, and flour of sulphur, each 4 ounces. 
Powder and mix them well together for use. One 
tablespoonful of this mixture may be given every 
night and moruing, in as much scalded bran, or a 
feed of corn moistened with w^ater, that the powder 
may adhere thereto. 

This powder will be found excellent for such 
horses as are kept on dry food, whether they be in 
the stable or travel on the road; also for stallions 
in the spring of the year, as they not only keep the 
body cool and open, but cause him to cast his coat, 
and make his skin appear as bright as silk.

Purging. 

In obstinate grease and swellings of the legs, ac- 
companied with lameness of the joints, dry coughs, 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 191 

worms, diseases of the skin, farcy, apoplexy or stag- 
gers, affections of the liver, and several other diseases 
treated of in this book, mercurial purges are of the 
greatest service. The purges destroy worms, gene- 
rally increase the flow of urine, operate upon the 
skin, liver, and other viscera in a peculiar manner, 
cause a healthful action in these parts, and remove 
many chronic complaints incident to the horse. 
Great caution is necessary during their operation, 
lest 'the horse take cold. The water given him 
must be warm, and when exercised he should be 
properly clothed. 

Horses that are kept on dry food, and are full fed, 
with little or no exercise, require regular purging 
every six months, with 2 or 3 . doses each time, 
allowing proper intervals between each; and those 
horses which run in stage-coaches, (whose labour is 
often more than their natural strength is able to 
bear,) and those whose legs are inclined to swell, all 
require purgative medicines, the use of which would 
be a means of preventing many of the diseases that 
attack this useful animal. 



No. 424. 

To prepare Horses for Physic. 

After violent exercise, horses are liable to lose 
their appetite, and to have their stomach loaded 
with crudities and undigested matter, the non- 
removal of which by the use of proper physic is the 
chief cause why so many die daily. Previous to 
administering a purge, the body should be prepared. 

The proper method of preparing a horse* for 



192 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

physic is to give him 2 or 3 mashes of scalded 
bran and oats, and warm water, for 3 or 4 days 
together. This will soften the fseces and promote 
the operation of the medicine. But if a strong 
purge be given to a horse of costive habit with- 
out preparation, it will probably occasion a violent 
inflammation.

To cure Gri'pes in Horses. 

This disorder goes by different names in different 
districts of the country ; as fret, — from the uneasiness 
attending it; bots, — from its being thought to arise 
from these animals or worms, &c. The animal looks 
dull and rejects his food; becomes restless and un- 
easy, frequently pawing ; voids his excrements in 
small quantities, and often tries to stale ; looks 
round, as if toward his own flank or the seat of 
complaint ; soon appears to get worse, often lying 
down, and sometimes suddenly rising up, or at times 
trying to roll, even in the stable, &c. As the dis- 
order goes on, the pain becomes more violent ; he 
appears more restless still, kicks at his belly, groans, 
rolls often, or tumbles about, with other marks of 
great agitation ; becomes feverish, and has a cold

moisture at the roots of his ears and about his 
flanks, and, when he lies at rest a little while, begins 
to perspire strongly, and to get covered with sweat 
more or less profuse. 

In most cases of ordinary gripes, signs of flatu- 
lence, or of the presence of air confined in the 
bowels, occur, and constitute a part of the disease, or 
increase it. The removal of it is, therefore, an object 
to which the attention of most grooms has been in 
a chief degree directed ; and as it can frequently 'be 
got rid of, and the disease cured, by exciting the 
powerful action of the intestines, cordial and stimu- 
lating medicines are had recourse to, and no doubt 
in many have aflbrded relief. Some farriers, indeed, 
without much care in distinguishing cases, almost 
exclusively rely upon such, and employ them too 
freely. This, however, should not be done ; for it 
sometimes happens that disorders not unlike flatu- 
lent colic or gripes occur when there is neither 
pent-up air present, nor any relaxation or want of 
energy and action in the intestines themselves ; and 
stimulating medicines might then do no good, but 
often much mischief. 

When the disorder is early discovered, or has 
newly come on, it will be proper to lose no time to 
get ready a clyster, and likewise a medicinal draught 
for removing the wind and abating the pain. After 
removing with the hand any excrement in the great 
gut that can be reached by it, a clyster, made of 5 
or 6 quarts of water or water-gruel, blood-warm, and 
6 or 8 ounces of common salt, may be injected ; and 
one or the other of the following draughts may be 
given before, or about the same time: —

gin. This will serve for one dose. 

Another. — Take of table-beer, a little warmed, 1|

spoonful ; gin, whiskey or rum, from 2 to 4 ounces 
or from 1 to 2 glassfuls : these mix together for one 
dose. 

Another. — Oil of turpentine 1 ounce, and water- 
gruel 11 pints, mixed, for a dose. 

These and the like preparations may be given, 
either out of a bottle or drench-horn, one or two 
persons raising and keeping properly up the horse's 
head, while another, who administers the medicine, 
pulls out, and a little aside, the tongue, with his left 
hand, and with the other pours in the draught.

Further Treatment. 

Cordial drenches of the kinds recommended, with 
the clyster, will have the eflect, in ordinary cases, to 
relieve the disorder. But should this not be the case, 
after waiting an hour or two, (longer or shorter ac- 
cordiog to the severity of the ailment, or the period 
since its commencement,) then the medicine should 
be repeated, but in a less dose than at first, — perhaps 
one-half or two-thirds of the former quantity. The 
horse should be occasionally walked out, properly

covered witli cloths, lest the chill air bring on shi- 
vering and give rise to feverishness ; and his belly 
should be now and then ruobed a considerable time 
at once, 5 or 10 minutes, but with intervals of rest, 
so that it may have time to stale or dung. If the 
disorder does not yield to these remedies, then 
others must be employed of a more active nature. 
Some persons recommend castor-oil, in the propor- 
tion of half a pint to a pint, with an ounce or two 
of laudanum or tincture of opium, mixed with 
water-gruel in the quantit}' of a pint or rather less. 
In case the horse has lain down, and continued so 
for some time, and is covered with sweat, when he 
rises, two or more persons should be employed to 
rub him dry; and he should also be kept well 
clothed. The stable should be airy, moderately 
cool, and his place in it roomy and well littered, to 
keep him from hurting himself should he roll about.

White's Ball for Gripes. 

Draughts of liquid medicine operate more speedily 
than any other form ; but, as the disorder may attack 
a horse during a journey, where such cannot readily 
be procured, Mr. White has given a receipt for a ball 
for the convenience of those who travel; and if it be 
wrapped up closely in a piece of bladder, it may be 
kept a considerable time without losing its power. 
The ball is composed of the following ingredients, 
viz. : Castile soap, 3 drachms ; camphor, 2 drachms ; 
ginger, 1^ drachms; and Venice turpentine, 6 
drachms : to be made into a ball for one dose.

Laudanum Draught. 

Laudanum may be used in cases of urgency, es- 
pecially in the wet or lax gripes. Take a quart of 
beer, and make it a very little warmer than blood- 
heat ; then put a tablespoonful of powdered ginger 
into it, and a small wineglassful of laudanum, just 
before it is given to the horse. This, in most cases, 
will give ease in a short time ; but, if the complaint 
is exceedingly violent, give about half the above 
quantity again in 15 or 20 minutes. As soon as the 
pain seems to be abated, if the belly is costive, give 
the horse a purgative. In case of looseness, no pur- 
gative must be given : the laudanum, which is of a 
binding nature, will correct it. 

When pain is occasioned by inflammation, it is 
seldom proper to employ opium, or any medicine of 
that kind ; but when it depends upon spasm or irri- 
tation, no medicines are so beneficial. In inflamma- 
tion of the bowels, for example, opium would cer- 
tainly do much injury; but in flatulent or spasmodic 
colic, or gripes, it seldom fails of success. 



No. 449. 

Another Anodyne Medicine, 

When horses are aftected with colic, or where the 
use of anodynes is requisite, the following prepara- 
tion may be given, namely : opium, 1 drachm, or 60 
grains; Castile soap, 2 drachms ; and powdered anise- 
seed, 1 ounce, or 4 drachms : to be made into a ball 
with syrup for one dose. 



204 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

In speaking of the medicines for gripes, or the 
flatulent colic, sometimes termed fret, Mr. White 
mentions, "Domestic remedies may be employed 
when proper medicines cannot be procured in time. 
For this purpose a draught may be readily made up 
of a pint of strong peppermint-water, with about 4 
ounces of gin, and any kind of spice." 

Another. — A pint of Port wine, with spice or 
ginger. 

Another. — Half a pint of gin diluted with 4 
ounces water, and a little ginger. 

Another. — Take of Epsom salts, 6 ounces ; Castile 
soap, sliced, 2 ounces. Dissolve them in IJ pints 
warm gruel ; then add tincture of opium, J ounce ; 
oil of juniper, 2 drachms. Mix, and give them new- 
milk- warm. 

This drink may be repeated every 4 or 5 hours, 
till the symptoms begin to abate.

in a pint of warm gruel. 

For the colic, flatulency, and colicky pains of the 
intestines, this drink will be found a valuable 
cordial. 

Another. — The complaint may be removed by 
warm beer and ginger, or a cordial ball mixed with 
warm beer. 

It is necessary to repeat the caution given respect-

ing the necessity of distinguishing the flatulent, or 
windy, or spasmodic colic, from the inflammatory 
one, and from that which depends on costiveness. 
It is always necessary to empty the bowels by 
means of clysters; and, should the horse have ap- 
peared dull and heavy previous to the attack, it will 
be advisable to bleed. If costiveness attends it, 
give a laxative drench after the paroxysm, which 
will prevent its return.

To cure Surfeit or bad Coat in Horses. 

Take crocus metallorum, or liver of antimony, 1

bran. This may be given to horses subject to this 
disorder once a day, among their oats : it relieves 
the appetite, destroys worms, sweetens the l.lood, 
against all obstructions opens the passage, and im 
proves tired and lean horses in a great degree ; it is 
also of great service in coughs and shortness of 
breath. It may be given daily from 2 to 4 weeks, 
and will soon produce a fine coat. The horse may 
be worked while he is taking the medicine, care 
being taken not to expose him to wet or cold.

Bemedy for Lameness in Horses, 
Mr. Sewell, of the Veterinary College, stated his 
having discovered a method of curing horses which 
are lame in the forefeet. It occurred to him that 
this lameness might originate in the nerves of the 
foot, near the hoof; and in consequence he imme- 
diately amputated about an inch of the diseased 
nerve, — taking the usual precaution of guarding the 
arteries and passing ligatures, &c. By this means 
the animal was instantly relieved from pain, and the 
lameness perfectly cured.

Grind the quicksilver with the turpentine, in a 
marble mortar, for 5 or 6 hours, until it completely 
disappears ; and add a little oil of turpentine to make 
it rub easier ; then add the remainder, and work them 
all well together till united. 

This ointment must be well rubbed on every part 
affected, in the open air, if the sun shine and the 
weather be warm ; but, if it be winter, take the horse 
to a blacksmith's shop, where a large bar of iron 
must be heated, and held at a proper distance over 
him, to warm the ointment.

afterwards add the remainder, taking care that they 
are well mixed. 

This liniment must be well rubbed in with a hard 
brush, in the open air, provided the day be fine and

To cure Measles in Swine. 

It sometimes happens, though seldom, that swine 
have the measles. While they are in this state their 
flesh is very unwholesome food. This disorder is 
not easily discovered while the animal is ahve, and 
can only be known by its not thriving or fattening 
as others. After the animal is killed and cut up, its 
fat is full of little kernels, about the size of the roe 
or eggs of a salmon. When this is the case, put 
into the food of each hog, once or twice a week, as 
much crude pounded antimony as will lie on a shil- 
ling. This is very proper for any feeding swine, 
even though they have no disorder. A small quan- 
tity of the flour of brimstone, also, may be given 
among their food when they are not thriving, which 
will be found of great service to them. But the best 
method of preventing disorders in swine is to keep 
their sties perfectly clean and dry, and allow thorn 
air, exercise, and plenty of clean straw.

HiqMre in Swine. 

"Where a number of swine are bred, it will fre- 
quently happen that some of the pigs will have what 
is called a "rupture," — Le. a hole broken in the rim 
of the belly, where part of the guts comes out and 
lodges betwixt the rim of the belly and the skin, 
having an appearance similar to swelling in the tes- 
ticles. The male pigs are more liable to this dis- 
order than the females. It is cured by the following 
means : — 

Geld the pig aflected, and cause it to be held up 
with its head downward. Flay back the skin from 
the swollen place, and, from the situation in which 
the pig is held, the guts will naturally return to their 
proper place. Sew up the hole with a needle, which 
must have a square point, and also a bend in it, as 
the disease often happens between the hind-legs,

Cure for the Foot-Bot in Sheep. No. 1. 

Take a piece of alum, a piece of green vitriol, and 
some white mercury, — the alum must be in the 
largest proportion ; dissolve them in water, and 
after the hoof is pared anoint it with a feather, and 
bind on a rag over all the foot.

Another Cure for Foot-Rot in Sheep. No. 3. 

Some anoint the part with a feather dipped in aqua- 
fortis or weak nitrous acid, which dries it at once. 
Many drovers that take sheep to market carry a 
little bottle of this with them, which, by applying 
to the foot with a feather, helps a lame sheep by 
hardening its hoof, and enabling it to travel better. 
Some may think aqua-fortis of too hot a nature ; 
but such a desperate disorder requires an active cure, 
which, no doubt, is always to be used cautiously. 

Another. — Spread some slaked quick-lime over a 
house-floor pretty thick, pare the sheep's feet well, 
and then turn them into this house, w^here they may 
remain for a few hours ; after which, turn them into 
a dry pasture. This treatment may be repeated 2 
or 3 times, always observing to keep the house clean, 
and adding a little more quick-lime before putting 
them in. 

The feet must be often dressed, and the sheep 
kept as much as possible on dry land. Those 
animals that are diseased should be kept separate 
from the flock, as the disorder is very infectious.

Prevention and Cure of the Foot-Rot in Sheep. 

On suspected ground, constant and careful ex- 
amination ought to take place ; and when any fis- 
sures or cracks, attended with heat, make their ap- 
pearance, apply oil of turpentine and common 
brandy. This in general produces a very beneficial 
efiect ; but where the disease has been long seated, 
and becomes in a manner confirmed, after cleaning 
the foot and paring away the infected parts, recourse 
is had to caustics, of which the best seems to be sul- 
phuric acid and the nitrate of mercury. After this, 
pledgets are applied, the foot bound up, and the 
animal kept in a clean dry situation until its re- 
covery is effected. 

But it often happens, where the malady is in- 
veterate, that the disease refuses to yield to any or 
all of the above prescriptions. 

The following mode of treatment, however, if 
carefully attended to, may be depended upon as a 
certain cure. "Whenever the disease makes its 
appearance, let the foot be carefully examined, and 
the diseased part well washed, and pared as nigh as 
possible not to make it bleed; and let the floor of 
the house where the sheep are confined be strewn 3 
or 4 inches thick with quick-lime hot from the kiln ; 
and the sheep, after having their feet dressed in the 
manner above described, to stand in it during the 
space of 6 or 7 hours. 

In all cases, it is of great importance that the 
animal be afterw^ards exposed only to a moderate 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 217 

temperature, be invigorated with proper food, and 
kept in clean, easy, dry pasture ; and the disease 
will be eftectually remedied in the course of a few 
days.

To cure the Scab in Sheep, 

Take 1 pound quicksilver, J pound Venice tur- 
pentine, 2 pounds hog's lard, and | pound oil or 
spirits of turpentine. A greater or less quantity 
than this may be mixed up, in the same proportion, 
according to the number of sheep affected. Put the 
quicksilver and Venice turpentine into a mortar or 
small pan, and beat together until not a particle of 
the quicksilver can be discerned ; put in the oil, or 
spirits of turpentine, with the hog's lard, and work 
them well together until made into an ointment. 
The parts of the sheep affected must be rubbed with 
a piece of this salve, about the size of a nut, or rather 
less. When the whole flock is affected, the shep- 
herd must be careful in noticing those that show any 
symptoms of the disorder, by looking back and 
offering to bite or scratch the spot ; and if affected, 
he must immediately apply the ointment, as it is 
only by paying early and particular attention that a 
flock can be cured.

together, and cork it up in a bottle, with a quill 
through the cork, so that the liquid may come out 
of the bottle in small quantities at once. The bottle 
must always be well shaken when it is to be used. 
When the spot is observed where the maggots are, 
do not disturb them, but pour a little of the mixture 
upon the spot, as much as will w^et the wool and the 
maggots. In a few minutes after the liquor is ap- 
plied, the maggots will all creep to the top of the 
wool, and in a short time drop off dead. The sheep 
must, however, be inspected next day, and if any of 
the maggots remain undestroyed, shake them off, or 
touch them with a little more of the mixture.

To cure Hoven or Blown in Cattle, 

This complaint is in general occasioned by the 
animal feeding for a considerable time upon rich, 
succulent food, so that the stomach becomes over- 
charged, and they, through their greediness to eat, 
forget to lie down to ruminate or chew their cud. 
Thus the paunch, or first stomach, is rendered inca- 
pable of expelling its contents ; a concoction and 
fermentation take place in the stomach, by which a 
large quantity of confined air is formed in the part that 
extends nearly to the anus, and, for want of vent at 
that part, causes the animal to swell even to a state 
of suffocation, or a rupture of some part of the 
stomach or intestines ensues. As sudden death is 
the consequence of this, the greatest caution is 
necessary in turning cattle into a fresh pasture, if 
the bite of grass be considerable ; nor should they 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 219 

be suffered to stop too long at a time in such pas- 
ture before they are removed into a fold-yard, or 
some close where there is but little to eat, in order 
that the organs of rumination and digestion may 
have time to discharge their functions. If this be 
attended to several times, it will take away that 
greediness of disposition, and prevent this distressing 
complaint. 

Treatment. — As soon as the beast is discovered to 
be either hoven or blown, by eating too great a 
quantity of succulent grasses, let a purging-drink be 
given : this will, for the most part, check fermenta- 
tion in the stomach, and in a very short time force 
a passage through the intestines.

Purging- Drinks, 

Take of Glauber's salts, 1 pound ; ginger, in pow-

seed and ginger, in powder, each, 2 ounces ; molasses,

purge a fall-grown animal of this kind. By strict 
attention to the above method of application, a fever 
may be prevented, and the animal speedily restored.

Paunchhig. 

This is a method frequently resorted to in dan- 
gerous cases. The operation is performed in the 
following manner : — 

Take a sharp penknife and gently introduce it 
into the paunch between the haunch-bone and the 
last rib on the left side. This will instantly give 
vent to a large quantity of fetid air ; a small tube of 
a sufficient length may then be introduced into the 
wound, and remain until the air is sufficiently 
evacuated ; afterward take out the tube and lay a 
pitch-plaster over the orifice. Wounds of this kind 
are seldom attended with danger ; where it has 
arisen, it has been occasioned by the injudicious 
operator introducing his knife into a wrong part. 
After the wind is expelled and the body has been 
reduced to its natural state, give the following : — 

Cordial Drink. — Take anise-seed, diapente, and ele- 
campane, in powder, each 2 ounces; tincture of rhu-

2d. Construct 5 sheepskin cups, of the same height 
as the copper ones and 3 J inches in diameter. Set 
them inside the copper cups. 

3d. Make 5 zinc cylinders, 4J inches high and 2J 
inches in diameter, open at each end, and place them 
inside the sheepskin cups, with copper sockets at- 
tached to them, as with the copper cups. 

4th. After placing the cups thus formed in a con- 
venient position, connect them together with copper 
wires, as follows : — The first copper cylinder with the 
second zinc ; the second copper with the third zinc ; 
the third copper with the fourth zinc ; and the fourth 
copper with the fifth zinc; observing always to con- 
nect the copper with the zinc. 

How to charge the Battery. — Fill the cups within 
about half an inch of the top with water -, then put 1 
teaspoonful of Glauber's salts into each of the sheep- 
skin cups, between the zinc and sheepskin ; then 
put 1 teaspoonful of blue vitriol into each of the 
copper cups, which, when dissolved, will charge the 
battery for some days. Introduce the conducting- 
wires, and it is ready for action. 

To prejxire the Gold Solution. — Dissolve the gold in

Sow to preserve Fruit 

A number of persons who- have been putting up 
fruit in " air-tight cans" have stated to us that they 
are losing large quantities of it by fermentation, 
and inquire of us the cause of the difficulty. This 
we cannot easily explain without first seeing the 
cans. The cause may be in the imperfect manner 
of scalding and putting up the fruit; or it may 
arise from the defective form in which the cans are 
made. 

If the cans are properly constructed, it only 
remains to scald the fruit sufficiently, and to fill the 
cans so near the top as to leave the least possible 
amount of air in them, taking care that the moisture 
does not rise into the channel formed for the sealing- 
material, and to close the cans while scalding hot. 
To do this, as we before stated, the most expeditious 
and sure method is to first scald the fruit in a kettle, 
fill the cans, and set them into a vessel of boiling 
water, there to remain until the sealing is com- 
pleted. — Louisville Journal.

Another method of preserving Fruits and Vegetables. 

A great deal of mystery has been made of this 
simple matter, and it is generally supposed that the 
process is known only to the initiated. 

"With a good air-tight can, the simple agent in 
the work is heat; and it is only necessary to know 
what degree of heat is required, and how to apply it. 
The common mode is to fill the can with the fruit, 
and set it in a vessel of boiling water, letting it 
remain until the fruit is thoroughly heated through, 
— say from a half to three-quarters of an hour, and 
then seal up. This mode is objectionable, on ac- 
count of the time required and shrinkage of the 
fruit, leaving the can but about two-thirds full, by 
which the use of one-third (or four cans of every 
dozen) is lost. 

The most convenient, certain, and expeditious 
method is to prepare fruit, either with or without 
sugar, as if for immediate use, put it in a preserving- 
kettle or open vessel, (with a small quantity of water 
when necessary to prevent scorching,) and let it 
remain over the fire until it comes to the boiling- 
point ; then fill the can, and seal it up immediately. 

Direction for sealing. — Fill one can at a time with 
the boiling fruit, put on the cap, press it to its place, 
until you fill the groove around it with the melted 
composition ; pour a little cold water on the top of 
the can to chill the wax; then set the can in cold 
water, and let it remain until cool : when taken out, 
hold it to the ear, and, if there be any imperfection 
in the can, the air will be heard forcing itself in.

wherever there are offensive putrid gases, dissolve 
copperas and sprinkle it about, and in a few days 
the smell will pass away. If a cat, rat, or mouse 
dies about the house, and sends forth an offensive 
gas, place some dissolved copperas in an open vessel 
near the place where the nuisance is, and it will 
soon purify the atmosphere.

Directions for making good Candles from Lard. 

For 12 pounds lard, take 1 pound saltpetre, and 1 
pound alum ; mix and pulverize them ; dissolve the 
saltpetre and alum in a gill of boiling water ; pour 
the compound into the lard before it is quite all 
melted ; stir the whole until it boils ; skim off what 
rises ; let it simmer until the water is boiled out, or 
until it ceases to throw off steam ; pour off the lard 
as soon as it is done, and clean the boiler while it 
is hot. If the candles are to be run, you may com- 
mence immediately; if to be dipped, let the lard 
cool to a cake, and then treat it as you would tallow.

To cure Rancid Butter. 
A writer in the "Journal of Industrial Progress'* 
recommends that butter should be kneaded with 
fresh milk, and then with pure water. He states 
that by this treatment the butter is rendered as fresh 
and pure in flavour as when recently made. lie 
ascribes this result to the fact that butyric acid, to 
which the rancid taste and odour are owing, is 
readily soluble in fresh milk, and thus removed.

How to cure Butter that will keep for Years. 

Take 2 parts good common salt, 1 part sugar, 
and 1 part saltpetre ; beat them up and blend the 
whole together. Take 1 ounce of this composition 
for every pound of butter; work it well into the 
mass, and close it up for use. Butter cured in this 
way appears of a rich, marrowy consistence and 
fine colour, and never acquires a brittle hardness 
nor tastes salt. It will likewise keep good 3 years, 
— only observing that it must stand 3 weeks or a 
month before it is used. It ought to be packed in 
wooden vessels, or in jars vitrified throughout, which 
do not require glazing, because during the decom-

the butter becomes rancid.

How to cure Pork and Hams dry without Brine. 

First rub your hams and pork on the flesh-side 
with brown sugar thoroughly, and take care that as 
much sugar will lie on it as you possibly can. Having 
it covered all over, (from 1 to 2 pounds of sugar to 
each hog is suflicient,) you can either lay the meat 
on a table or any kind of vessel that will not hold 
any pickle ; then, when you have one layer laid, 
cover it all over with fine salt, (of course, the flesh- 
side,) and squeeze it on with your hand as tight as 
you can, and so on with each layer. Then leave it so 
for 8 or 10 days. By this time the salt will nearly all 
be dissolved, when you have to take it out and pack 
it again, and cover it all over with fine salt the 
same as at first. Then let it stand for 3 or 4 weeks 
longer, according to the size of the hogs, then hang 
it in smoke. This method is excellent for dried 
beef.

Brilliant White- ^Yash, 

Many have heard of the brilliant stucco white- 
wash on the east end of the President's house at 
"Washington. The following is a receipt for it : it 
is gleaned from the "iN'ational Intelligencer." 

Take J bushel nice unslaked lime, slake it with 
boiling water, cover it during the process to keep in 
the steam. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or 
strainer, and add to it a peck of salt, previously well 
dissolved in warm water, 3 pounds ground rice,- 
boiled to a thin paste, and stirred in boiling hot, 
J pound powdered Spanish whitiug, and a pound 
of clean glue, which has been previously dissolved 
by soaking it well, and then hanging it over a slow 
fire, in a small kettle w^ithin a large one filled with 
water. Add 5 gallons hot water to the mixture, 
stir it well, and let it stand a few days, covered from 
the dirt. It should be put on right hot : for this pur- 
pose, it can be kept in a kettle on a portable furnace. 
It is said that about a pint of this mixture will cover 
a square yard upon the outside of a house, if properly 
applied. Brushes more or less small may be used, 
according to the neatness of the job required. It 
answers as well as oil-paint for wood, brick, or stone, 
and is cheaper. It retains its brilliancy for many 
years. There is nothing of the kind that will com- 
pare with it, either for inside or outside walls. 
Colouring-matter may be put in, and made of any 
shade you like. Spanish brown stirred in will make 
red pink, more or less deep, according to the quantity. 
A delicate tinge of this is very pretty for inside 



250 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

walls. Finely pulverized common clay, well mixed 
with Spanish brown, makes a reddish stone colour. 
Yellow ochre stirred in makes yellow wash ; but 
crome goes further, and makes a colour generally 
esteemed prettier. In all these cases the darkness 
of the shades of course is determined by the quantity 
of colouring used. It is difficult to make rules, 
because tastes are different : it would be best to try 
experiments on a shingle, and let it dry. Green 
must not be mixed with lime : it destroys the colour, 
and the colour has an effect on the white-wash which 
makes it crack and peel. "When walls have been 
badly smoked, and you wish to have them a clean 
white, it is well to squeeze indigo plentifully through 
a bag into the water you use, before it is stirred in 
the whole mixture. If a larger quantity than 5 
gallons be wanted, the same proportion should be 
observed.

Put this into a piece of linen, and enclose it well all 
round with fullers' earth about an inch thick. Let 
it dry, then put it between two crucibles over a slow 
fire, to get heat by degrees. Push on the fire till 
the lump becomes red-hot, and melted all together ; 
let the w^hole cool gradually, and pound it into 
powder. When you want- to solder any thing, put 
the two pieces you want to join on a table, approach- 
ing their extremities as near as you can to one 
another, making a crust of fullers' earth, so that 
holding to each piece and passing under the joint, 
it should open over it on the top ; then throw some 
of your powder between and over the joint. Have 
some borax, which put into hot spirits of wine till it 
is consumed, and with a feather rub your powder at 
the joint: you will see it immediately boih As soon 
as the boiling stops, the consolidation is made. If 
there be any roughness, grind it ofl:* on a stone.

Alum for the Hog Cholera, 

A writer says, — " Last May my hogs were attacked 
with hog cholera; and, upon mentioning it to a 
friend, he. spoke of a suggestion published in the 
Cincinnati papers, advising the use of alum. I pro- 
cured some, made a strong solution, (all the water 
would bear,) and drenched all I found with the 
disease npon them, and gave to the lot (about 100 
head) a pound of pulverized alum in some mill-feed 
each day for two weeks, by which time all remain- 
ing seemed healthy. Out of twenty-two drenched 
with one pint of the solution to each, administered 
with the assistance of a rope behind the tusks, and 
a horn with the small end sawed off, I lost five 
head, and, with the exception of two, the remaining 
seventeen appear to have entirely recovered to a 
healthy, thrifty condition. Some of those which 
have recovered were in the last stage, vomiting, 
with red blotches on the skin, and bleeding at the 
nose, which I have always considered the last stage 
of the disease. The above is but little cost, and, if 
it is as successful as with me, is well worth the trial."

German Silver. No. 1. 

The following are the different receipts for the 
manufacture of German silver which are adopted 
by one of the first manufacturers in London ; pre- 
mising that the metals should be as pure as possible. 

Common German Silver. — Copper, 8 ; nickel, 2 ; 
zinc, 3i. This is the commonest that can be made 
with any regard to the quality of the article pro- 
duced. It might do for common purposes. If the 
quantity of nickel be reduced much below this, the 
alloy will be little better than- pale brass, and will 
tarnish rapidly. 

No. 582. 

German Silver. No. 2. 

Good Cferman Silver. — Copper, 8 ; nickel, 3 ; zinc, 
3|. This is a very beautiful compound. It has the 



260 600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 

appearance of silver a little below standard ; by 
some persons it is even preferred to the more 
expensive compound. We strongly recommend 
manufacturers not to use a metal inferior to this. 



No. 583. 

German Silver. No. 3. 

Mectnim. — Copper, 8 ; nickel, 4 ; zinc, 3|. This 
is a compound which, for ease of working and beauty 
of appearance, is to be preferred to all others by the 
manufacturer, and is generally preferred by the pub- 
lic. It has a shade of blue like very highly-polished 
silver ; it tarnishes less easily than silver. 



No. 584. 

German Silver. No. 4. 

Copper, 8; nickel, 6; zinc, ^. This is ^ the 
richest in nickel that can be made without injuring 
the mechanical properties of the metal. It is a YQvy 
beautiful compound, but requires a higher heat for 
fusion than the preceding, and will be found rather 
more difficult to work. 

No. 585. 

German Silver. No. 5. 

Tutenag. — Copper, 8 ; nickel, 3 ; zinc, 4^. These 
proportions were obtained by the analysis of a piece 
of Chinese tutenag of the best ordinary quality; but 
some of the specimens of Chinese tutenag are equal 



600 MISCELLANEOUS VALUABLE RECEIPTS. 261

This alloy is very fusible, but very hard, and not 
easily rolled : it is the best adapted for casting.

Hoici to Foison Rats. 

Mix 2 pounds carbonate of barytes with 1 pound 
lard, and lay it in their way. It is tasteless, odour- 
less, and impalpable, produces great thirst, and death 
immediately after drinking. Another way is to mix 
arsenic and lard together, and spread it on bread, 
and push a piece in every rat-hole ; or some small 
pieces of sponge may be fried in drippings or honey, 
and strewed about for them to eat. The sponge will 
distend their intestines, and will cause their death. 
Or \ pint plaster of Paris, mixed with oat-meal, 1 
l^int, w^ill prove equally fatal to them.

Headache is in general a symptom of indigestion 
or deranged general health, or the consequence of a 
confined state of the bowels. The following altera- 
tive pill will be found a valuable medicine. Take

grains; precipitated sulphuret of antimony, 1 scru- 
ple ; guaiacum, in powder, 1 drachm. Kub them 
well together in a mortar for 10 minutes; then, with 
a little conserve of hips, make them into a mass, and 
divide it into 20 pills. Dose. — One pill is given 
every night, or every other night, for several weeks 
in succession.

REGULAR SHAPED LYING CASKS. 



EXPLANATION OP TABLES. 

The chief design in this invention has been to enable any 
person to ascertain in one minute what number of gallons are 
contained in a lying cask, regular shaped, of different dimen- 
sions, when full or partly full. 

EULE I.— For Table No. 1. 
Take the rod with inches and tenths of inches marked on 
it, put it into the cask diagonally, from the bung-hole to each 
head, to get the exact centre. Then look at Table No. 1 : 
the first column will show the diagonal inches from centre of 
bung to each head of cask, and the second column the con- 
tents of cask. 

RULE II.— For Table No. 2. 

To get the number of gallons when a cask is not full, take 
the bung diameter and wet inches on rod, and look at Ullage 
Table No. 2 for full contents of cask. 
The 1st column shows the number of gallons in a full cask. 

^^ ^d " " the bung diameter. 

" 3d " '' wet or dry inches on rod. 

^' 4th " ^^ what remains, if part be out. 
Suppose a cask to contain 135 gallons, and the bung dia- 
meter to be 34 inches, and 10 inches wet on the rod, the 
right-hand, or 4th column will show 30 J gallons remaining. 
Should the wet inches come above the centre, and only 10 
inches be dry, there would be 30 j gallons out, leaving 104^ 
gallons in.
