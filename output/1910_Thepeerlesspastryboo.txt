Crescent Manufacturing Company, 
Seattle, Washington. 
Gentlemen : 

At the suggestion of my friends and fellow 
tradesmen I am publishing this Cook Book, and in 
doing so it lias been necessary to solicit advertise- 
ments to defray expenses. I have been careful to 
include mostly advertisements of products which T 
have personally used. 

In view of the fact that the Crescenl Manu- 
facturing Company have taken an interest in this 
publication, I wish to endorse the claims made by 
them regarding their products, for since coming to 
Seattle, five years ago, I have continually used 
Crescent Baking Powder, and unhesitatingly state 
that I consider it better than any other I have 
ever used. 

Yours very truly,

No. 250. SUGAR BOILING. 

Loaf sugar is the best sugar for boiling. Take 
to each ten pounds of sugar one quart of water and 
one teaspoonful of cream of tartar. In order to have 
the sugar in perfect condition, brush down the sides 
with a hair brush, dipped in water, and skim, let 
boil on a brisk fire. The first degree is the small 
thread which will take about ten minutes. Dip your 
forefmeer in ice water and then in the boiling sugar, 
when a small thread forms by pulling it between two 
fingers, the degree is reached. If the large thread 
is wanted, let boil a little longer, test as before and if 
the thread is somewhat more sufficient, it is the large 
thread. The next degree is the blow, and can be as- 
certained by putting the skimmer in the sugar, and 
blow through it and small feather filaments will fly 
out. Then comes the soft ball. Dip the finger in ice

water, then in the boiling sugar and immediately in 
the water again, form it between two fingers into a 
little ball; if too soft, let boil a little longer and try 
again. The hard ball is reached by boiling a little 
longer, and test in the same manner. Next is the 
crack. Make a thin wooden stick, dip into ice 
water, then into the sugar and immediately into the 
ice water again ; to be certain that the sugar is done. 
place it between your teeth and bite it. it must nol be 
sticky. Caramel is obtained by boiling the sugar 
until it turns lighl brown. Remove from the fire and 
place the bottom of the pan in ice water to prevent 
ilh sugar from turning dark.

Bread, Rolls. Griddle Cakes, Etc. 

Bread was first made without leaven, heavy and 
solid. Then beer yeast was used until the so-called 
stock yeast was discovered. Finally compressed yeast 
came into use throughout the civilized world and was 
pronounced the most economical and convenient of all 
leavening agents. For those who can not get com- 
pressed yeast a few directions how to make yeast. 

Ko. 252. STOCK YEAST (A). 

Boil 5 lbs. of potatoes with enough water to 
cover : when near soft add 2 oz. hops and let boil from 
5 to 8 minutes longer. In the meantime have a tub 
ready, place 4 lbs. of flour, 4 oz. of sugar and 2 oz. of 
corn meal in it. pour the boiling potatoes with the 
water over the flour and mix all into a paste, little by 
little add some cold water, keeping the paste smooth 
all the time: mix until it becomes blood warm, using 
about 4 gals, of water in all. Then mix in 2 cakes 
<»i* Magic Yeast, dissolved in cold water, and strain 
through a cullander into an earthen jar and keep for 
about 12 hrs. and the yeast is ready for use. After

about 1-3 yeast and 2-3 water.

GENERAL REMARKS. 

Tn order to insure successful work great care, 
discrimination and judgment must be used. The ma- 
terials often differ in quality. Some flour requires 
more moisture than others. Some butter may be of 
a poor quality. Some eggs are larger than others, 
and therefore the good judgment of the workman is 
required. 

[Jse great care in measuring and weighing. For 
cake baking use only cake flour (winter wheat). 
When making pie, always puncture the top crust be- 
fore placing it on the fruit. Have the butter washed 
before using it. If no cake flour can be obtained use 
a little more butter. 

Beking sheets should be cleaned by making them 
hot in the oven, then scrape and wipe with a cloth. 

When freezing ice cream and sherbets use 1 
<|t. rock salt to 8 (|ts. crushed ice. Punches and sher- 
bets are to be served in glasses with an handle. 

In making cake mixtures always keep the eggs 
cold, and have the butter soft, for loaf cakes, etc. 

Fruit for cakes should be rubbed in with flour be- 
fore adding to mixture. When baking large fruit 
cake or loaf cake place a sheet of greased paper on 
the cake to prevent a loo dark color. 

When making bread or rolls, the doughs and 
sponges should always be well mixed. The ingred- 
ients should be carefully weighed to obtain uni- 
formity. 

Sponge is ready for use from its first drop. The 
temperature for sponge is 80 deg. Fahrenheit. Never 
let a sponge dough rise to full proof after the first 



PEERLESS PASTRY BOOK. 87 

proof is worked out of it. When making straight 
dough, work together after two hours proof, then 
give it full proof. 

Be very careful in selecting yeast, for this is a 
very important factor to create a good and healthy 
fermentation. 

Of course any intelligent baker knows that 
Fleischmann's compressed yeast is always found re- 
liable. 

In writing this book it has been my aim to pre- 
sent a very carefully selected collection of recipes, 
which T have iiocd with verv good results.
