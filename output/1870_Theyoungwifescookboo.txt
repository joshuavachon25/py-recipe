The Young Wife's Cook Book will be 
found to contain a carefully prepared system 
of cooking, comprising receipts for preparing 
everything suitable to go on any one's table, 
as well as for preparing good and tempting 
dishes from cold meats, vegetables, and pud- 
dings, which may be served with all the 
warmth and appetizing appearance of the 
original dish. Every housekeeper must be 
aware that no previous book upon cooking 
has been given containing satisfactory infor- 
mation upon this point. That this subject 
is important, will be recognized when we 
think that there are none but the families 
and houses of the wealthiest who do not, as 
a general rule, have roasts, as well as other 
eatables, sent to the table twice and even 
thrice. How much more acceptable, then, 

19 



20 PREFACE. 

to our luxurious American taste, would be a 
warm, savory dinner, prepared from these 
materials, than the everlasting " cold 
shoulder." 

We give also to our readers numerous 
receipts for preparing for the table the sec- 
ondary parts of animals — such as the heart, 
liver, tripe, feet, etc., and compounding 
from these usually cheap portions many 
dishes which will rival the great joints, and 
win the suffrages of those who are tired of 
tlie endless succession of beef, mutton and 
chicken. 

It has been thought advisable, therefore, 
to give in this work a collection of plain 
and useful receipts, selected from family 
MSS., having been tried and vouched for 
by those from whom they have been ob- 
tained. It is also enriched by the contribu- 
tions of many foreign friends, who have 
given us the opportunity of verifying the 
saying that America has no national cuisine, 
but assimilates to herself the experience of 



PREFACE. 21 

every nation, to prepare the abundance of 
riches that a kind Providence has showered 
upon us. 

We recommend, particularly to young 
housekeepers, a profound study of our 
Housewifery department. The hints are 
not only invaluable, but have been well 
tried and their worth ascertained. Indeed, 
the contents of our whole book are entirely 
new, and useful information will be found 
upon each and every page, tending to sim- 
plify labor, and to increase the comforts of 
any one's home. 

Though it is not desirable, in this enlight- 
ened age, that ladies should, like their great- 
grandmothers, devote themselves exclusively 
to household duties, yet a thorough knowl- 
edge of domestic management is not incom- 
patible with the cultivation of the mind, 
or the practice of those accomplishments 
which adorn the sex. On the contrary, 
this knowledge encourages them to all the 
studies and pursuits which tend to make 



22 PREFACE. 

home happy. The useful instruction so 
necessary to attaua this great aim of life 
is rarely supplied at school, or at home, to 
girls at that early age when the mind is 
ductile, and the frame active ; and conse- 
quently, in mature years, the attempt to ac- 
quire new habits is frequently irksome and 
mortifying. 

Let every young wife and mother remem- 
ber her serious responsibility, and take care 
that the husband and the children find their 
home to be truly the haven of refuge from 
temptation — the calm resting place from 
labor and care — and the bright and cheerful 
abode of comfort. Good sense, good humor, 
and good principles are the female spells 
that diffuse cheerfulness and peace around 
the hearth of the poor as well as the rich 
man. Intellectual attainments, and bril- 
liant accomplishments, are agreeable fireside 
companions; but any woman, if she earn- 
estly determines to do her duty fiiithfully 
and pleasantly, may make her humble fire- 



PREFACE. 23 

side as happy to her husband, children^ and 
friends, as the brilliant drawing-room. In 
the management of a household, as well as 
in the regulation of the human mind, it is 
attention to the smaller daily duties which 
forms the sum of usefulness and happi- 
ness. 

Domestic comfort may be equally attained 
by all classes — provided, always, that the 
expenditure does not exceed the means, and 
that cheerful exertions are used to make the 
best of the means. 

The mistress of a family should always 
remember, that the welfare and good man- 
agement of the house depend on the eye of 
the superior — and consequently that nothing 
is too trifling for her notice whereby waste 
may be avoided. 

If a lady has never been accustomed, 
while single, to think of family manage- 
ment, let her not on that account fear that 
she cannot attain the art. 

It is certainly desirable to proportion the 



24 PREFACE. 

style of living as well to the fortune, as to 
the position in society ; but if the two can- 
not be made to agree, justice demands the 
sacrifice of such appendages to station as 
are inconsistent with the means. 

The expenditure must be carefully con- 
sidered, and retrenchment made on such 
articles as will least affect the comfort of 
her family. Every woman who earnestiy 
sets about it, may live within the means. 
An excellent common-sense maxim in house- 
hold management, as well as in important 
affairs, is, " Begin nothing without steadily 
looking to the end." 

A prudent housekeeper will alwaj's pro- 
vide in time everything that is actually 
wanted ; but will never be tempted to buy 
what is not wanted, and then try to find a 
use for it. 

She should never allow hurry or bustle to 
be the practice of the household, or nothing 
will be well done. 

It is unnecessary for any woman to say 



PREFACE. 25 

she has not time to perform some important 
duty. A due arrangement and economy 
of time leaves opportunity for all things 
needful. 

Economy is an arrangement of order of 
things to produce a certain result. There- 
fore, no economy can be so important as the 
economy of time, the most precious posses- 
sion of man. 

A little reflection in the morning will 
enable mistress or servant to make due ar- 
rangements for the employment of the day 
before her, so that not one moment shall be 
misspent — the important duties to be per- 
formed at regular and stated periods; the 
lesser occupations to be introduced to fill up 
the disengaged spaces. 

In the pursuits of the mistress of a family 
there may be, however, unavoidable inter- 
ruptions — visitors; unforeseen domestic af- 
fairs; or accidents. But for these a well- 
regulated mind is ever prepared. Idle visit- 
ors must and will infest the homes of the 



26 PREFACE. 

Industrious, but the time need not be wholly 
lost. A piece of needlework, knitting, or 
even some simple household occupation may 
be carried on without offence to the visitors, 
and may, on the contrary, afford them a 
very useful lesson. 

On the mutual duties of servants and 
employers, we may say, that, in general, 
moderate demands and judicious forbearance 
produce respectful obedience. Servants 
should always remember that their services 
are only the just payment for their wages 
and support, and should scrupulously render 
them. But the attachment of a servant to 
a family can only be bought by mildness, 
forbearance and kind words — to them.

THE 

YOUXG WIFKS COOK BOOK. 



SOUPS. 



BOUILLON. 

1. A kind of French soup or stew, pre- 
pared as follows : An earthen pot, made to 
hold from one to seven pounds of meat is 
provided. A sufficient quantity of lean 
meat, usually part of the leg or shoulder, 
is put into this vessel, which is Hhen filled 
up with cold water — the proportion being 
five pints of water to a pound and a half of 
meat. The pot is then placed on the hearth 
close to the wood fire, and generally on the 
hot ashes. When it begins to simmer, the 
scum which is thrown up is carefully re- 
moved from time to time, three-quarters of 

(39) 



40 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

an hour being allowed for this purpose. A 
carrot, half a parsnip, a turnip, an onion, a 
little celery, and any other vegetables in 
season, are then added, together with salt, 
pepper, and spice. After these additions, 
the pot remains covered at the fire, and is 
kept there simmering for six hours more, 
hot water being from time to time supplied 
in the place of that which has evaporated. 

Marriage-ring Symbolized. — We see many times 
evGD the godly coujDles to jar when they are mar- 
ried, because there is some unfitness between them 
which makes odds. What is odds but the contrary 
to even ? Therefore, make them even, saith one, 
and there will be no odds. Hence came the first 
use of the ring in weddings : for if it be straighter 
than the finger it will pinch ; and if it be wider than 
the finger it will fall off; but if it be fit, it neither 
pincheth nor slippeth. 



BOUILLON. 



2. This is the common soup of France, 
and is in use in almost every French 
family. Put beef in an earthen stock-pot, 
in the proportion of one pound to one quart 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 41 

of cold water. Place it at the side of the 
fire and let it become slowly hot. By so 
doing the fibre of the meat is enlarged, the 
gelatine is dissolved, and the savorous parts 
of the meat are difiused through the broth. 
When the object is simply to make a good, 
pure-flavored beef broth, part of the shin 
or leg will answer the purpose, adding some 
vegetables, and letting it stew four or five 
hours. But if the meat is to be eaten, the 
rump, or leg-of-mutton piece should be used. 

But consider, and forget not thine own weak- 
ness ; so shalt thou pardon the failings of others. 



BEEF SOITP. 



3. Crack the bone of a shin of beef, 
and put it on to boil, in one quart of water 
to every pound of meat, and a large tea- 
spoonful of salt to each quart of water. 
Let it boil two hours ; and skim it well. 
Then add four turnips, pared and cut in 



42 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

quarters, four onions pared and sliced, two 
carrots scraped and cut in slices, one root 
of celery cut in small pieces, and one bunch 
of sweet herbs (which should be washed 
and tied with a thread, as they are to be 
taken out when the soup is served) . When 
the vegetables are tender, take out the 
meat, strain off the soup and return it to 
the pot again ; thicken it with a little flour 
and water ; then add some parsley finely 
chopped, with more salt and pepper to the 
taste, and some dumplings, made of a tea^ 
spoonful of butter to two of flour, moist- 
ened with a little water or milk. Drop 
these dumplings into the boiling soup ; let 
them boil five minutes; and serve them 
w^ith the soup in the tureen. Noodles may 
be substituted for the dumplings. 

Two SORTS OF Trials. — "Ah, Sam, so you've been 
in trouble, eh?" "Yes, Jem, yes." " Well, well, 
cheer up, man ; adversity tries us, and shows up 
our better qualities." "Ah, but adversity didnH try 
me — it was an Old Bailey judge, and he showed up 
my worst qualities." 



THE YOUNCj^ wife's COOK BOOK. 43 

A CHEAP SOUP. 

4. Wash three-quarters of a pound of 
barley in a little cold water; put it in a 
soup-pot with a shin or leg of beef of about 
ten pounds weight, cut into four pieces. 
Cover it well with cold water and set it on 
the fire. When it boils, skim it well, and 
put in two large onions. Set it by the fire 
to simmer very gently about two hours ; 
then skim all fat ofi*, and put in two heads 
of celery, and a large turnip cut into small 
squares. Season it with salt, and let it boil 
an hour and a half longer. Take out the 
meat with a slice, cover it up, and set it by 
the fire to keep warm, and skim the broth 
well before you put it into the tureen. Put 
a quart of the soup into a basin ; put about 
an ounce of flour into a stew-pan, and pour 
the broth into it by degrees, stirring it well 
together. Set it on the fire and stir till it 
boils, then let it boil up. Put the meat in 
a dish, and strain the sauce through a sieve 



44 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

over the meat. Add, if liked, some capers 

or minced gherkins or walnuts, etc. The 

water in which meat has been boiled makes 

an excellent soup for the poor, by adding 

vegetables, barley, or peas. Koast beef 

bones make fine pea-soup; and should be

that the fat may be taken off. 

A GLUTTON fell sick, and sent for a doctor. " T 
have lost ray appetite," said he, in great alarm. 
" It's not of the slightest consequence," replied the 
doctor; '' youHl he sure to die if you recover it.'" 



SAGO SOUP. 
5. Boil two pounds of beef in rather 
more water than sufficient to cover it, until 
the essence is completely extracted from the 
meat. Strain the broth, and add to the 
broth one teacupful of sago. Boil it gently 
for one hour, but do not let the sago be- 
come too soft. Beat the yolks of three 
eggs, pour them into your soup tureen, and 
then pour in the soup very gradually, stir- 
ring it gently.

SOUP OF BEEF'S HEART. 

6. Soak the heart several hours in salt 
and water to extract the blood, then cut it 
in large pieces, lengthwise. Parboil it, and 
cut it into small pieces, which must be put 
back into the liquor — to which add pepper, 
salt, some celery cut fine, a turnip cut in 
slices, some carrots nicely sliced, an onion 
chopped fine, and a bunch of parsley. Let 
it boil again till the vegetables are tender ; 
mix a little flour and water smoothly, and 
pour in to thicken the soup a very little, 

" Why do you not hold up your head as I do ?'' 
inquired an aristocratic lawyer of a laboring far- 
mer. "Squire," replied the farmer, "look at that 
field of grain. All the valuable heads hang down, 
like mine, while those that have nothing in them 
stand upright, like yours I" 



VEAL SOUP. 



7. Take a knuckle of veal, put it in a 
pot with four quarts of water, and add a 
teaspoonful of salt to each quart. Pare and 



46 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

slice three onions, four turnips, two carrots, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, and a small portion 
of celery. Let the veal boil one hour, then 
add the above vegetables. When they are 
tender, strain the soup. Put it in the pot 
it was boiled in, thicken the soup with some 
flour mixed smoothly with a little water, 
and add a little parsley finely chopped. 
Make some dumplings of a teaspoonful of 
butter, to two of flour, and milk or water 
enough to make a very soft dough. Drop 
them into the boiling soup. They should 
be about as large as a hickory-nut, when 
they are put in. If noodles are preferred, 
they may be put in and boiled ten minutes. 
Dish the meat with the vegetables around 
it. Drawn butter may be served with it, 
or any other meat sauce. 

A GENTLEMAN, finding some swine amongst his 
vines, said to his servant : "He to whom they 
belong is a fool." One of his servants, who recog- 
nized these animals, said to him: "Sir, they are 
yours." ''Well," rejoined the gentleman, "as I 
have said it, I shall not contradict myself."

SOUP FROM CALF'S FEET. 

8. Take four feet, clean them nicely and 
put them on to boil with rather more water 
than to cover them. Add to this three 
cnions sliced, three turnips cut in quarters, 
three carrots sliced, a bunch of parsley, the 
green top of a head of celery chopped fine, 
with salt and pepper to the taste. While 
boiling remove all the fat and scum. If the 
water boils away too much add a little more. 
Just before serving roll a piece of butter in 
some flour and stir it in. 

A HERO. — " Well, my good fellow," said a victori- 
ous general to a favorite soldier after a battle, " and 
"what did you do to help us to gain this victory?" 
" Do, may it please your honor, why I walked 
bouldly up to one of the inimy and cut off his foot." 
" Cut off his foot ! Why didn't you cut off his head ?" 
"Ah, an' faith, 3^our honor, that was off already." 



MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

9. Scald a calf's head, which cut into 
inch squares ; wash and clean them well, 
dry them with a cloth, and put them into a 



48 THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

Btew-pan, with two gallons of stock gravy, 
sweet basil, knotted marjoram, savory, a lit- 
tle thyme, some parsley, all chopped fine, 
cloves and mace pounded, half a pint of 
Madeira or sherry ; stew all together gently 
for four hours ; heat a little butter and milk 
[one pint], some flour mixed smooth in it, 
the yolk of two eggs ; keep these stirring 
over a gentle fire until near boiling; put 
this in the soup, stirring it as you put it in, 
for it is very apt to curdle ; then let all stew 
together for half an hour ; when it is ready 
to send to table, throw in some forcemeat 
balls and hard yolks of eggs ; when off the 

fire, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon.

Step among 3-our neighbors, reader, and see 
whether those among them who have got along 
smoothly, accumulated property, and gained a good 
name, have not been men who bent themselves to 
one single branch of business. It must be so. Go 
out in the spring, when the sun is far distant, and 
you can scarcely feel the influence of its beams, 
scattered as they are over the wide face of creation ; 
but collect those beams to a focus, and they kindle 
up a flame in an instant. So the man that squanders 
his talents and his strength on many things, will 
fail to make an im^ ression with either: but let him

draw them to a point — let him strike at a single ob- 
ject, and it will yield before Mm. 



WHITE SOUP. 

10. Take two quarts of the stock, and 
boil the crumb of a roll in a gill of milk ; 
beat the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs with 
three ounces of sweet almonds very well in 
a mortar, with a little cayenne pepper, and 
add the whole to the soup ; it may be poured 
over slices of French roll sent up in the tu- 
reen. White soup may also be varied with 
the rice. "Wash two or three ounces of the 
best kind, blanch it in boiling water, and 
drain it ; add the rice to the soup and let it 
stew until it swells; or thicken it with 
ground rice, bruised sago, tapioca, or arrow- 
root. If macaroni is used, it should be added 
soon enough to get perfectly tender, after 
soaking in cold water. Vermicelli may be 
added after the thickening, as it requires less 
time to do. If the stock has been made with 

fowl, take out the white portion when well

stewed, pound the meat in a mortar, and 
add it to the soup — which is a great improve- 
ment. It is the fashion now to send up 
grated Parmesan cheese with white soup; 
but it partly destroys that delicacy which 
ought to be the distinctive property of all 
w^hite soups. 

"Is a man and his wife one?" asked the wife 
of a man in a state of stupefaction, as she was hold- 
ing his aching iiead in both hands. " Yes, I sup- 
pose so," was the reply. "Well, then," said she, 
" I came home veiy drunk last night, and I ought 
to be ashamed of myself." 



WHITE SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

11. Put two quarts of water into a clean 
saucepan, the crumb of a small baker's loaf, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, some whole grains 
of pepper, two or three cloves, an onion 
chopped fine and a little salt. Let it boil 
half an hour. Then take the white parts of 
celery, endive, and lettuce, cut them into 
pieces, boil them in the soup till quite smooth. 
Strain the soup, set it over the fire again. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 51 

and when it begins to boil add a lump of 
butter rolled in a little flour ; let it boil a 
few minutes more, and serve. 

An old gentlewoman who lived almost entirely 
on soups, told us it was a long time before she could 
get them made uniformly good — till she made the 
following rule — " if the soup was good, she let the 
cook have the remainder of it — if it was not she gave 
it to her lap-dog ;" but as soon as this resolution 
was known, poor little Bow-Wow seldom got the 
sweet treat after. 



FRENCH GUMBO. 

12. Cut up one large fowl; season it 
with salt and pepper ; dredge it well with 
flour; have ready a soup-kettle; put in a 
tablespoonful of butter, one of lard, a hand- 
ful of chopped onion. Fry the fowl then to 
a good brown ; add ta this four quarts of 
boiling water; cover close; let it simmer two 
or three hours ; then put in fifty oysters with 
their liquor, a little thyme and parsley ; just 
before serving, stir in a tablespoonful of the 
filee powder ; season high with Cayenne pep- 
per. Turkey and beef-steak can make also 



52 THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

very good gumbo. The filee or felee is what 
gives a mucilaginous character and excel- 
lence to the soup. The powder consists of 
nothing more than the leaves of the sassa- 
fras cured in the shade, and then pounded 
and sifted ; therefore, any family in the coun- 
try can always have it in their house. 

If youth knew what age would crave, it would 
both get and save. 



OYSTER SOUP. 

13. Take one hundred oysters out of the 
liquor. To half of the liquor add an equal 
quantity of water. Boil it with one teaspoon- 
ful of crushed allspice, a little mace, some 
Cayenne pepper and salt. Let it boil twenty 
minutes, then strain it, put it back in the 
stew-pan and add the oysters. As soon as 
it begins to boil add a teacupful of cream 
and a little grated cracker rubbed in one 
ounce of butter. As soon as the oysters are 
plump, serve them.

Assist Children to Obey. — " Kiss mamma, dear- 
est," is a command )'0u may be sure will be obeyed 
with alacrity, but beware how you hazard your au- 
thority b}^ saying " Kiss that lady, my dear." Look 
well at the countenance of the child before you 
issue the command, to see whether it is willing to 
be embraced ; for it is of no importance whether it 
salute a stranger or not, but it is of immense im- 
portance that it should not disobey its mother in a 
single instance. 



CLAM SOUP. 

14. Boil fifty clams in two quarts of 
water, mix together, and add to it a little 
butter and flour. Just before it is taken off 
the fire, stir in the yolks of two eggs, and 
some cream, with a few sprigs of parsley 
and pepper; after these are added, let it 
simmer a few minutes, and then serve it. 
If preferred the parsley may be omitted. 

A LADY was engaged in domestic affairs, and the 
servant, who was a Catholic, when the door bell 
was rung, was requested by her mistress to say that 
she was not at home. "Yes, ma'am," said the ser- 
vant; and after she had done as she was bid, she 
returned to her mistress and inquired, " When 
I go to the praste, shall I confess that as my lie, 
ma^am, or shall I say it was youi^s.^^

CLAM SOUP. 

15. Take a knuckle of veal and boil It 
in three quarts of water salted to liking, 
with fifty clams and their juice, together 
with seasoning of pepper, parsley and onions. 
If the clams are small use more of them. 
A-dd to the soup some small dumplings 
made of an egg, some butter, and flour 
sufficient to form a paste. 

A MISERLY old lady, during the war, kept an inn. 
One day a famished soldier called, and asked for 
something to eat. Some beef bones, that had been 
prett}'' "well picked, . were set before him. After 
finishing his dinner, a little son of the landlady, no- 
ticing that the soldier found it very difficult to 
make out much of a dinner, put some money in his 
hand as he stepped out of the door. " How much 
was it worth, mother, to pick those bones ?" asked 
the boy. "A shilling," was the reply, the old lady 
expecting to receive the money. " I thought so, 
mother," replied the boy, "so I gave the soldier a 
shilling for doing it, and sent him away." 



EGG SOUP. 



16. Add to a pint of water the yolk of 
an egg well beaten, an ounce of butter, and 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 55 

the same quantity of sugar. Set it over the 
fire and stir it till it begins to simmer, then 
pour it several times from the pan to a basin, 
and back again till it is smoothed and 
frothed. This is a pleasant and good resto- 
rative. 

At breakfast one morning at an inn, a foreigner 
made quick despatch with the eggs. Thrusting a 
spoon into the middle, he drew out the yolk, de- 
voured it, and passed on to the next. When he had 
swallowed the seventh, an old farmer, who had al- 
read^^been prejudiced against monsieur by his mus- 
taches, could brook the extravagance no longer, 
and speaking up, said, " Why, sir, you leave all the 
white ! How is the landlord to afford a breakfast at 
that rate?" "Yy," replied the foreigner, "you 
w^ouldn't have me eat de vite ? De yolk is de 
chicken ; de vite de fedders. Yould 3'ou have me 
make von bolster of myself?" The farmer had 
never viewed the matter in that li^ht before. 



PEPPEE POT. 

17. Put your tripe on in water enough to 
cover it, allowing a teaspoonful of salt to 
each quart of water. Let it boil till quite 
tender, then have ready two calf's feet, put 
them in the pot with the tripe. Add four 



56 THE TOUXG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

onions chopped fine, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs. Just before taking it off the fire add 
two ounces of butter rolled in flour. Season 
the soup very highly with Cayenne pepper 
and salt. Whole grains of allspice or cloves 
may be added if liked. 

" I ADVISE you," says Johnson, " and I advise you 
with great earnestness, to do nothing that may hurt 
you, and to reject nothing that may do you good. 
To preserve health is a moral and religious duty, 
for health is the basis of all social virtue ; we can 
be useful no longer than when we are well." 



BEAN SOUP. 



18. Put a piece of pickled pork in a pot 
with two quarts of water. In another pot 
put one quart of dried beans after being 
picked and washed. As soon as the beans 
begin to boil take them out, put them in a 
colander to drain, then put them in with 
the pork and cover the whole with water. 
Boil them till they are quite soft. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 57 

SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

19. To one quart of water add three 
potatoes, three onions, three turnips, two 
carrots, a tablespoonful of rice or barley, and 
salt to the taste. Boil it down to one pint, 
then add a little parsley chopped fine about 
ten minutes before it is taken off the fire. 



GREEN CORN SOUP. 

20. Put on a knuckle of veal to boil in 
three quarts of water, and three teaspoonsful 
of salt. Cut the corn off of one dozen ears, 
and put it on to boil with the veal. When 
the veal is tender the soup is done. Then 
roll an ounce of butter in fiour and add to 
it before it is served. If the fire has been 
very hot and the water has boiled away too 
much, a little more may be added. 

Envy not the happiness in any man, for thou 
knowest not his secret griefs. 



58 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

SUMMER SOUP. 

21. Two cucumbers, twelve or fourteen 
onions, three potatoes, one lettuce, one head 
of white cabbage ; fry these together in 
butter, stew them three or four hours in 
three pints of stock ; add a little green mint, 
parsley, and a pint of green peas; let it 
stew for two hours more ; press it through a 
sieve and thicken it with flour and butter. 

A GENTLEMAN being asked to give a definition of 
nonsense, replied, in a Tiiompsonian st3'le — " Sir, it 
is nonsense to bolt a door with a boiled carrot." 



GREEN PEA SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

22. Take a quart of young green peas, 
and divide half a pint from them. Put 
them on in boiling water ; boil until tender, 
then pour off the water and set it by to 
make the soup with. Put the boiled peas 
into a pan and mash them ; then put them 
back into the water they were boiled in ; stir 
all well to":ether, and rub it through a hair 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 59 

sieve. Boil the half pint of peas, separated 
from the others, and when done, turn them 
into the soup and boil hot. The same may 
be made with the liquor in w^hich calf's 
head, calf's feet, or joints of veal, mutton, 
etc., have been boiled.

ANOTHER SOUP OF GEEEN PEAS. 

23. To a pint of shelled peas add one 
quart of boiling w^ater. When the peas are 
nearly soft, roll two ounces of butter in flour 
and stir in. Add pepper and salt to the 
taste, and a large dessert spoonful of sugar.

ANOTHER SOUP OF GREEN PEAS. 

24. Boil three quarts of shelled peas in 
two quarts of water. Mix three ounces of 
butter with flour until quite smooth; add a 
little salt, black pepper, and a dust of cay- 
enne pepper, and stir into the boiling peas 
until the whole boils again, and you will 
have a cheap and wholesome summer dish. 



PISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 

FISH AS FOOD. 

25. There is much nourishment in fish, 
little less than in butcher's meat, weight for 
weight ; and in effect it may be more nour- 
ishing, considering how, from its soft fibre, 
fish is more easily digested. Moreover, 
there is in fish a substance which does not 
exist in the flesh of land animals, viz. : 
iodine — a substance which may have a 
beneficial effect upon the health, and tend 



THE TOUNG W^IFE's COOK BOOK. 61 

to prevent the production of scrofulous and 
tubercular disease ; the latter, in the form 
of pulmonary consumption, one of the 
most cruel and fatal which the civilized, 
highly educated and refined are afflicted 
with. Comparative trials prove that, in 
the majority of fish, the proportion of solid 
matter — that is, the matter which remains 
after perfect desiccation, or the expulsion 
of the aqueous part — is little inferior to 
the several kinds of butcher's meat, game 
or poultry. And if we give attention to 
classes of people, classed as to the quality 
of the food they principally subsist on, we 
find that the ichthyophagous classes are 
especially strong, healthy, and prolific. In 
no class than that of fishers do we see so 
large families, handsome women, more 
robust and active men, or greater exemp- 
tions from maladies. 



62 THE YOUNG T\^IFE*S COOK BOOK. 
FISH. 

26. Fish should always be perfectly 
fresh when cooked. To select fresh ones 
observe the eyes; if they have a bright, life- 
like appearance the fish is fresh ; if, on the 
contrary, the eyes are sunken and dark 
colored, and have lost their brilliancy, they 
are certainly stale. Some judge by the 
redness of the gills, but they are sometimes 
colored to deceive customers. 



ECONOMICAL MODE OF COOKING SALMON. 

27. Cut some slices in the direction of 
the width of the fish. Put them in boiling 
water with a little salt, and let them boil 
ten minutes. By this method, the waste 
usually resulting from preparing the whole 
fish at once, is avoided. 

A CLASS was reciting a lesson in metaphysics— 
the chapter on motives operating on the human will 
— when a mackerel vender went by shouting, 
"Mackerel, fine fresh mackerel I" Suddenly, dis-

turbed b}^ the noise, the master inquired of the 
class what motive the man had for making such a 
noise. No answer being given, he said they must 
be deaf as haddocks, and flat as flounders, not to 
perceive that it was a sell-fish motive. 



HALIBUT. 

28. Cut it in slices about a quarter of 
an inch thick ; wash and dry them, season 
with Cayenne pejDper and salt; have ready 
a pan of hot lard, and fry your fish in it 
till of a delicate brown on both sides. 

Some dip the cutlets in beaten egg and 
then in bread crumbs, and fry them. When 
done in this manner it should be cut rather 
thinner than according to the first method. 

Or, heat your gridiron, grease the bars, 
season your fish with Cayenne pepper and 
salt, and broil it till of a fine brown color. 
Lay it on a dish and butter it.

week we took him to the poor-house. Your affec-

CAT-FISH. 

29. Cut each fish in two parts, down the 
back and stomach; take out the upper part 
of the back bone next the head; wash and 
wipe them dry, season with Cayenne pep- 
per and salt, and dredge flour over them; 
fry them in hot lard of a nice light brown. 
Some dress them like oysters; they are 
then dipped in beaten egg and bread 
crumbs, and fried in hot lard. They are 
very nice dipped in beaten egg, without the 
crumbs, and fried. 

Serjeant Cockle, who was a rough, blustering

TO CUEE SHAD. 

30. Clean the shad nicely, place them 
in layers with back down, and laid open 
so as the inside of the fish may be up. 
Sprinkle each fish plentifully with ground 
salt, and let them stand twenty-four hours. 
This draws out all the blood. Wipe them 
all dry with clean napkins. Place them in 
layers in a clean tub, with the backs down 
as before. For one hundred shad take half 
a pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of 
brown sugar. Strew plenty of rock salt 
over them with the saltpetre and sugar; 
there is no danger of putting on too much 
salt as they will only absorb a certain 
quantity.

SHAD ROASTED ON A BOARD. 

31. Take a piece of clean oak board, 
about three inches thick and two feet 
square, stand it before the fire till the 
board is very hot, indeed, almost charred. 
Have your shad split down the back, 
cleaned, washed, wiped dry, and seasoned 
with salt. Fasten it to the hot board with 
a few small nails — the skin side should be 
next the board ; place the board before the 
fire, with the head part down. As soon as 
the juices begin to run turn it with the tail 
down. It should be turned frequently, in 
order to retain the juices. When done, 
butter it and serve it hot. Send it to the 
table on the board. This is the receipt 
for baking shad of the Philadelphia " fish 
house." 



BROILED SHAD. 

32. Split your shad down the back, 
wash it, and season it well with salt. Have 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 67 

your gridiron heated — grease the bars — 
put on the shad, and broil it slowly till 
quite done. It should be of a fine brown 
on both sides. If designed for the dinner- 
table, after having basted it well with but- 
ter on both sides, fold it over, that it may 
assume its original form, and serve it. 

Mr. Watson, uncle to the late Marquis of Kock- 
ingham, a man of immense wealth, finding himself 
at the point of death, desired a friend who was pres- 
ent to reach him a drawer, in which was an old 
shirt, that he might put it on. Being asked why he 
would wish to change his linen when he was so ill, 
he replied — " Because I am told that the shirt I die 
in must be the nurse's perquisite, and this is good 
enough for her." This is as bad as the old woman, 
who, with her last breath, blew out an inch of 
candle, '* Because," said she, " I can see to die in

SHAD, SOTJCED. 

33. Cut the fish in half, and then in 
slices, crosswise. Put them in a milk crock, 
with very sour cold vinegar poured over 
them ; then add Cayenne pepper, fine black 
pepper, salt, and whole allspice. Put a 



68 THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 

crust over the top of the crock, and stand 
it in an oven. The iish must be highly 
seasoned. 



BOILED SHAD. 

34. Clean your shad, wash it and wipe 
it, flour it well, wrap it in a cloth, and put 
it into a large vessel of boiling water with 
a great deal of salt. It will require about 
twenty minutes to cook it. Serve it with 
egg sauce or rich drawn butter. 

The Oak, that now spreacleth its branches 
toward the heavens, was once but an acorn in the 
bowels of the earth. 



FRIED SHAD. 

35. Cut your shad in half, wash it and 
wipe it dry, score it, and season with Cay- 
enne pepper and salt, dredge flour over it, 
and fry it in hot lard. When done, put the 
two halves together, that it may assume the 
appearance of the whole fish. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 69 

POTTED SHAD. 

36. Cut a shad in six or eight pieces, 
wash and wipe it dry. Mix one dessert- 
spoonful of ground allspice, half a table- 
spoonful of black pepper, and half a table- 
spoonful of salt — sprinkle a portion of this 
seasoning over each piece of shad. Put 
them into a stone jar, with enough good 
cider vinegar to cover them ; cover the jar 
with a clean cloth, and over this tie closely 
several thicknesses of brown paper to keep 
in the steam ; set it in a moderate oven and 
let it remain twelve hours. This is very 
good, but the fish is dark-colored.

and one tablespoonful of whole black pep- 
per ; put one tablespoonful and a half of 
salt over the shad the evening before it is 
to be potted; the next morning sprinkle 
over it half a teaspoonful of Cayenne pep- 
per. Place the shad in a stone jar, and 
over each layer throw a portion of the 
grains of pepper and allspice, cover it with 
vinegar, and set it in a moderate oven for 
twelve hours.

Cayenne pepper and salt. Let them stand 
at least one hour before they are cooked,

that the seasoning may have time to pene- 
trate them. Have ready a pan of hot lard, 
dredge flour over your fish, put them in the 
pan and fry them slowly, that they may be 
done through. They should be of a hand- 
some brown on both sides. All pan fish are 
fried in the same way. 

If thy soul thirsteth for honor, if thy ear hath 
any pleasure in the voice of praise, raise thyself 
from the dust whereof thou art made, and exalt thy 
aim to something that is praiseworthy. 



BOILED ROCK. 



39. Scale a rock, take out the eyes and 
gills, draw it, and wash it well. Flour a 
cloth, wrap the fish in it, and boil it in 
plenty of water strongly salted. A com- 
mon-sized fish requires about half a large 
teacupful of salt. Place your fish-kettle 
over a strong fire, and when the water boils 
put in the fish. Let it boil hard twenty 
minutes. Take it out of the cloth carefully,

place it on your fish dish, and send it to the 
table. Have egg sauce in a sauce boat. 
Mashed potatoes are an accompaniment to 
boiled fish. Garnish the dish with green 
parsley. If any of the boiled fish should 
be left from dinner, it may be spiced as 
shad, and make an excellent relish for 
breakfast or tea. 



COLD BOILED ROCK FISH. 

40. Lay the fish in a deep dish. Put as 
much vinegar as will cover it into a kettle 
with some whole grains of allspice, a little 
mace and two or three cloves. Boil the 
vinegar and spice. Season the fish highly 
with Cayenne pepper and salt. Then pour 
the spiced vinegar over while boiling hot. 
When cold it makes a nice relish for break- 
fast. Any boiled fish may be prepared in 
the same manner. 

When Canning's health was drunk, at the Minis- 
ter's Black wall dinner, he replied, " Gentlemen, this

for 3^our good wishes, I do not see that we can do 
better than follow the exo,mple of the fishes, who 
drink a good deal, hut never speak.^^ 



COLD ROCK FISH, SOUSED. 

41. Extract the bones from the cold 
fish which may have been left from dinner. 
Season the fish with Cayenne pepper, salt, 
a few grains of allspice, one or two cloves, 
and a sprig of mace. Put the fish into a 
deep dish. Boil enough vinegar to cover 
the fish, and pour it over boiling hot. In 
twelve hours it will be fit for the table.

of salt, and simmer ten minutes ; serve on 
a napkin, with sauce in a tureen. 



POTTED HERRING. 

43. Clean your herring, wash them 
well and wipe them dry; then rub each 
one with salt and Cayenne pepper ; place 
in your jar a layer of herring, then some 
grains of allspice, half a dozen cloves, and 
two or three blades of mace ; then put in 
another layer of herring, and so on till all 
are in ; cover the herring with cold vinegar, 
tie up the jar closely with several thick- 
nesses of paper, and set it in the oven 
after the bread has been drawn out ; let it 
remain there all night. As soon as they 
become cold they will be fit for use. 

Though sometimes small evils like invisible in- 
sects, inflict pain, and a single hair may stop a vast 
machine, yet the chief secret of comfort lies in not 
suffering trifles to vex one, and in prudently culti- 
vating an undergrowth of small pleasures since 
very few great ones, alas ! are let on long leases.

HERRING, FRIED. 

44. Scale, wash and dry your herrings 
well ; lay them separately on a board, and 
set them to the fire two or three minutes 
before you want to use them ; dust the fish 
with flour, and when your lard is boiling 
hot, put in the fish, a few at a time, and 
fry them over a brisk fire. 



FRESH HERRINGS. 

45. Cut oJQf the heads, and well clean 
the herrings; place them on a gridiron 
over a bright fire, and broil for ten or 
twelve minutes, according to size ; serve 
very hot, with the following sauce in a 
tureen : 

Mustard Sauce for Red Herring. — 
Knead a dessertspoonful of baked flour 
and a teaspoonful of flour of mustard with 
three ounces of butter, and stir into a gill 
of boiling water ; boil five minutes ; add a 
teaspoonful of vinegar, and serve.

An Irish footman, who got a situation at the 
west end of London, on entering a room where 
there was a vase of gold lish, exclaimed, " Well, 
this is the first time I ever saw red herrings alive.'' 



BAKED HEERINGS. 

46. Take off the heads of six herrings ; 
put them into a deep dish and season with 
a saltspoonful of pepper, a teaspoonful of 
salt, a quarter of a grain of Cayenne, two 
cloves, four allspice, six pepper-corns, a 
blade of mace, half an inch of bruised 
ginger, and a teaspoonful of grated horse- 
radish; add a gill of cold water and a 
gill of good vinegar. Bake in a slow 
oven for half an hour. Serve cold, with 
the sauce strained, and a teaspoonful of 
finely chopped chives added.

CROaUETTES OF EISH. 

47. Take dressed fish of any kind, sepa- 
rate it from the bones, mince it with a 
little seasoning, an egg beaten with a tea- 
spoonful of flour, and one of milk; roll 
it into balls; brush the outside with egg, 
and dredge it well with bread crumbs ; fry 
them of a nice color; the bones, heads, 
tails, with an onion, an anchovy, and a 
pint of water, stewed together, will make 
the gravy. Lobsters make delicate cro- 
quettes; in which case the shell should 
be broken and boiled down for the gravy. 



Dr. Sharp, of Hart Hall, Oxford, had a ridicu- 
lous manner of prefacing every thing he said with 
the words, "I say." An undergraduate having, as 
the doctor was informed, mimicked him in this pe- 
culiarit}^ he sent for him to give him a lecturing — 
which he thus began : ** I say, they sa}^ you say, I 
say, I say." When, finding the ridiculous combina- 
tion in which his speech was involved, he concluded 
by bidding the j^oung satirist begone to his room.

A NICE WAY OF SERVING TIP ANY KIND 
OF COLD FISH WITH STALE BREAD. 

48. Dip a flat dish in liot water, to pre- 
vent cracking; grease it with butter, and 
sprinkle Cayenne pepper on it — then a thick 
layer of stale bread, grated fine ; upon the 
bread place a layer of fish, picked from the 
bones, and divided into small pieces ; an- 
other layer of bread as before, with a little 
melted butter poured over it. Repeat this 
process as often as required for the quantity 
of fish. Smooth the surface with a spoon, 
and sprinkle slightly with fine bread mixed 
with pepper. Place it in an oven for 
twenty or thirty minutes. Cold mutton 
may be served in the same way. 



A Frenchman had heard the phrase, " I've got 
other fish to fry," uttered by a person who was in a 
hurry and did not wish to be detained. He deter- 
mined to remember the phrase and its application. 
One day a friend invited him to go and walk ; and, 
being otherwise engaged, he thought of the above 
expression, and gave it thus — " Excuse me to-day,

FISH FRITTERS. 

49. Take the remains of any fish which 
has been served the preceding day, remove 
all the bones, and pound it in a mortar. 
Add bread crumbs and mashed potatoes in 
equal quantities. Mix together half a tea- 
cupful of cream with two well-beaten eggs, 
some Cayenne pepper, and anchovy sauce. 
Beat all up to a proper consistency, cut into 
small cakes, and fry them in boiling lard. 

In one of our city schools, not many j^ears ago, 
a member of the committee asked a member of a 
class which was under examination, " What was the 
cause of the saltness of the ocean ?" Soon one 
little girl raised her head, flushed with the dis- 
covery which had flashed upon her mind. " You 
may tell," said the committeeman. "Saltjish, sir," 
said the pupil. 



CAKES OR BALLS MADE FROM COLD COD 
FISH.

a paste. Make it out into thin cakes, flour 
them, and fry them to a fine brown. Any 
cold fish may be dressed in this manner.

SALTED COD FISH. 

51. Wash it, and soak it all night. 
Boil it ia fresh water until it is done, but 
ih> not let it Ml to pieces. It should be 
served with mashed potatoes. It is usual 
to season with Caj^enne pepper and mustard 
after it comes to the table.

A NICE DISH FROM FRAGMENTS OF COLD 
FISH. 

52. Take the cold fish, separate it from 
the bones, and cut into small pieces. Ob- 
tain oysters, in number proportioned to the 
quantity of fish. Stew them slowly in their 
own liquor for two or three minutes ; take 
them out with a spoon ; skim the liquor, 
and pour it into a basin. Put a bit of but- 
ter into the stew-pan, melt it, and add as 
much bread crumbs as will dry it up ; then 
put the oyster liquor into the pan with the 
butter and crumbs, and give it a boil. Put 
the cold fish into scallop shells that have 
been previously buttered and strewed with 
bread crumbs ; add a couple of oysters to 
each ; divide the oyster liquor between the 
different shells, cover with bread crumbs, 
and drop bits of butter on the top of each. 
Then brown in a Dutch oven. The whole 
may be prepared at once in a large flat dish, 
instead of the scallop shells. Those who

The prolificac}^ of edible fish, is a subject fitted, 
for the most evident reasons, to call forth our wonder 
and thankfulness toward a beneficent Providence. 
Lewenhock, the ph3'siologist, counted 9,384,000 eggs 
in a cod, 36,900 in a herring, 38,278 in a smelt, 546,681 
in a mackerel, 225,568 in a flounder, 1,355,400 in a 
plaice, 100,000 in a sole, in a carp 3,685,760, and in 
a trench 300,000. 



FRIED OYSTERS. 

53. Select the largest oysters for frying. 
Take them out of their liquor with a fork, 
and endeavor in doing so to rinse off all 
the particles of shell which may adhere to 
them. Dry them between napkins. Have 
ready some grated, cracker, seasoned with 
Cayenne pepper and salt. Beat the yolks 
only of some eggs, and to each egg add 
half a tablespoonful of thick cream Dip 
the oysters, one at a time, first in the egg 
then in the cracker crumbs, and fry them 
in plenty of hot butter, or butter and lard

mixed, till they are of a light brown on 
both sides. Serve them hot. 



PICKLED OYSTERS. 

54. Have ready two and a half quarts 
of oysters, with a full pint of their liquor. 
To this quantity take one and a half pints 
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, and 
a tablespoonful of mace, one tablespoonful 
of allspice, the same quantity of white 
pepper, and a teaspoonful of cloves. Put 
the vinegar, salt, and liquor on to boil, and 
when it comes to a boil, skim it ; then add 
the spices, give it another boil up, and 
after this put in the oysters. Be careful 
they do not burn. They must be cooked 
over a quick fire. They must be served 
cold.

PICKLED OYSTERS. 
55. Take one hundred oysters out of 
their liquor, and add to them as much 
water as there was liquor. Put them over 
the fire with salt to the taste, skim them, 
and as soon as they boil take them off. 
Have ready in a pan one gill of vinegar, 
one tablespoonful of allspice, one table- 
spoonful of pepper grains, a little Cayenne 
pepper and mace, and half a gill of pepper. 
They should be pickled the day before 
they are eaten." After standing a few 
hours, if a scum should have risen on 
them, take out the oysters, and strain the 
liquor. About six hours before they are 
to be served, slice a lemon and add to 
them. ^ 

One of our young bloods, dining at a fashionable 
hotel a few weeks since, was requested by a gentle- 
man to pass some article of food that was near him. 
"Do you mistake me for a waiter ?" said the ex- 
quisite. " No, sir, I mistook you for a gentleman,'' 
was the reply.

OYSTER OMELET, No. 1. 

56. Beat four eggs very light. Cut 
the hard part out of eight or a dozen oys- 
ters, according to their size, wipe them dry, 
and cut them up in small pieces, stir them 
into the beaten egg and fry them in hot 
butter. When the under side is brown, 
sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the 
top, and fold one half over the other. 
Never turn an omelet, as it makes it 
heavy. 

Let not thy recreations be expensive, lest the 
pain of purchasing them exceed the pleasure thou 
hast in their enjo^-ment. 



OYSTER OMELET, No. 2. 

57. Beat six eggs to a thick froth, then 
add by degrees one gill of cream, and beat 
them well together. Season the eggs with 
pepper and salt to taste. Have ready one 
dozen fine oysters, cut them in half, pour 
the eggs in a pan of hot butter, and drop 



86 THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 

the oysters over it as equally as possible. 
Fry it a light brown, and serve hot. An 
omelet should never be turned. 

In a certain School, during the parsing lesson, 
the word waif occurred in the sentence. The 
youngest who was up, a bright-eyed little fellow, 
puzzled over the word for a few minutes, and then 
a bright idea struck him — " I can parse it. Posi- 
tive waif, comparative wafer, superlative sealing- 
wax I" 



OYSTER OMELET, No. 3. 

58. Eight oysters chopped fine, six 
eggs, a wineglassful of flour, a little milk, 
with pepper and salt, to the taste. Beat 
the eggs very light, add the oysters and the 
flour, which must be mixed to a paste with 
a little milk. Pepper and salt to the taste. 
Fry in hot butter, but do not turn it. As 
soon as it is done, slip it on a dish and 
serve it hot. The above is the usual mode 
of preparing oyster omelet. But the better 
way is to put your oysters in a stew-pan, 
set them over the fire, and the moment 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 87 

they begin to boil take them out, drain 
them, and dry them in a napkin. They 
are not so watery when prepared in this 
manner, and consequently will not dilute 
the beaten egg as much as the former mode. 
When they are cold, mince them and pro- 
ceed as above. 

One of our writers asks what sort of animals are 
the laziest. We think it likely that oysters are, for 
they never get out of their beds till they are pulhd 
out. 



SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

59. Drain your oysters and season them 
with salt and Cayenne pepper; crumb 
some stale bread, and season it with salt 
and pepper. To each gill of the bread 
crumbs add one hard boiled egg, finely 
chopped; butter a deep dish, strew in a 
layer of egg and crumbs, then a lajer of 
the oysters, with some lumps of butter on 
them, then more crumbs, and so on till all 
are in. Put a cover of crumbs on the top.

Bake this in a tolerable quick oven and 
serve it hot. 

Lose no time ; be always employed in some- 
thing useful : cut off all unnecessaiy actions. 



STEWED OYSTERS WITH CREAM. 

60. Rinse one hundred oysters, and 
put them in a stew pan with the water 
which adheres to them ; season them with 
salt and Cayenne pepper, and a very little 
mace. As soon as they begin to boil pour 
in half a pint of cream, and stir in half 
an ounce of butter rolled in a little grated 
cracker. Let them 'boil once and serve 
them hot. 



PLAIN OYSTER PATTIES. 

61. Make little round loaves, or take 
small French rasps — make a hole in the 
top of each, and scrape out a portion of the 
crumb. Put some oysters into a stew-pan 



THE YOUNG ^ IFe's COOK BOOK. ^^9 

with their own liquor, and add to them the 
crumbs of bread, rubbed or grated fine, and 
a lump of butter. Season with black pep- 
per and a sprinkle of Cayenne. Stew for 
five or six minutes, and then put in a 
spoonful of good cream. Fill the rasps or 
loaves, and cover with the bits of crust 
previously cut off. Set them in an oven for 
a few minutes to crisp. 

Minced veal, lamb, poultry, game, etc., 
may be done in the same way as for paste 
patties. 

" Bring in the o^^sters I told j^ou to open," 
said the head of the household, growing impatient. 
" There they are," replied the country cook, proudly ; 
"it took me a long while to clean 'em, but I've done 
it«at last, and thrown all the insides into the slop 
bucket.''^ 

" I KNOW a genius," observed Meister Karl, " who 
has an howdacious plan of opening oysters. He 
spreads 'em in a circle, seats himself in the centre, 
and begins spinning a yarn. Sometimes it's a lion- 
slaying adventure — sometimes a legend of his love 
—sometimes a descent into the crater of Vesuvius. 
As he proceeds the oysters get interested ; one by 
one they gape with astonishment at the tremendous 
whoppers which are poured forth, and as they gape

OYSTER PIE. 

62. Take one hundred oysters out of 
their liquor, one at a time, so as to free 
them from any portions of the shell which 
might adhere to them. Drain, and place 
them between clean napkins, in order to 
dry them perfectly. Pour off half the liquor 
into a stew-pan, " salt it to your taste, stir in 
one gill of cream, one ounce and a half of 
butter rolled in grated cracker, and a little 
Cayenne pepper. Boil two eggs hard, chop 
them up, and mix them with as many 
bread crumbs as will cover the top of your 
pie. Season the bread and Q^g with Cay- 
enne pepper and salt. Make a rich paste, 
line the sides of your pie dish, put in the 
oysters, pour the hot liquor over them, 
and strew the bread crumbs on the top. 
Cover the whole with a lid of paste. Cut 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S OOOK BOOK. dl 

an opening in the centre of the tcfp crust, 
and ornament it with flowers or leaves 
made of the paste. Bake it and serve it 
hot. As soon as the crust is done take the 
pie out of the oven. 

A LEARNED CLERGYMAN ill Maine was accosted 
in the following manner by an illiterate preacher 
who despised education : — " Sir, you have been to 
college I suppose?" "Yes, sir," was the reply. 
" I am thankful," replied the former, " that the Lord 
has opened my mouth without any learning." "A 
similar event," replied the latter, " took place in 
Balaam's time ; but such things are of rare occur- 
rence in the present day." 



TERRAPINS. 

63. Put the terrapins on in boiling 
water and let them boil ten minutes, take 
them out and with a coarse cloth rub all 
the skin off the head, neck, and claws, 
also the thin shell that may come loose. 
Then boil them in clean water, with a 
little salt in it, until the claws are perfectly 
soft. The time of boiling depends very 
much on the age of the terrapin; some 



92 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

take three hours. When they are soft, 
open them carefully, take out the sand- 
bag, the spongy part, and the gall, which 
you must not break. Cut all the remain- 
der of the terrapin in small pieces, put 
them in a stew pan, and to each large 
terrapin take a quarter of a pound of 
butter, one wine glass of Sherry or Ma- 
deira wine, salt, black, and red pepper, 
and mustard, to suit the taste ; also, to 
each terrapin, the yolks of two hard boiled 
eggs, mashed to a paste, with a little 
butter. Mix the whole together, and stew 
fifteen minutes. Send them to the table 
hot. 



LOBSTER SALAD. 

64. One large lobster, three tablespoon- 
fuls of French mustard, or two dessert- 
spoonfuls of common mixed mustard, one 
gill and a half of vmegar, one gill and a 
half of sweet oil, the yolks of five hard 



THE YOUNG T^IFE'S COOK BOOK. 93 

boiled eggs, salt to taste, a small teaspoon- 
ful of Cayenne pepper, the inside leaves 
of two heads of cabbage lettuce. Cut the 
meat and lettuce in small pieces. Boil the 
eggs hard, mash the yolks with a wooden 
or silver spoon.

Even he that hath shut out idleness from his house, 
and hath said, Sloth, thou art mine enemy. 



TO MAKE A NICE RELISH OUT OF FRAG- 
MENTS OF COLD LOBSTER OR CRAB. 

65. It often happens after lobster or 
crah suppers or luncheons, that legs and 
claws, and portions of the back are left 
untouched. Collect all the fragments of 
fish, and put with them two blades of 
mace, a little pepper and salt, and a small 
portion of butter; the quantity of the 
latter must be proportioned to the amount 



94 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of lobster. Put these all together, and beat 
them into a paste in a mortar. Take small 
jars and fill these with the prepared lob- 
ster. If there are any solid parts of the 
tail, which cannot well be reduced to a 
paste, they may be cut into small pieces, 
and set in the middle of the jars, and the 
paste poured over them. When the jars 
are nearly filled, press down the contents, 
pour over them a layer of clarified butter, 
or lard. This will afford a nice relish 
for breakfast, luncheon, or supper. If in- 
tended to be kept for some time, tie down 
with pieces of thick paper. 

A YOUNG lady at a ball was asked by a lover of 
serious poetry, whether she had seen " Crabbers 
Tales ?" " Why, no," she answered, " I didn't know 
that crabs had tails." "I beg your pardon, miss,"

" I assure you, sir, I was not aware that red crabs 
had tails nor any other."

MEATS, POULTRY, GAME, 
ETC. 

MEATS. 

66. The finest grained beef is the best, 
the flesh is of a fine red, and the fat a light 
cream color, but not yellow; the fat, too, 
is solid and firm; the lean of mutton 
should be of a red color, and the fat white ; 
the lean of veal should be of a light color, 
and the fat white ; the skin of pork should 
be of a light color, and if young it is 
tender; the fat should appear firm; a 
tender goose is known by taking hold of 
the wing and raising it; if the skin tears 
easily the goose is tender, or if you can 
readily insert the head of a pin into the 
flesh it is young; the same remarks will 
hold good with regard to ducks; young 
chickens may be known by pressing the 
lower end of the breast bone ; if it yields 
readily to the pressure they are not old. 



96 THE YOUNG wife's COOK BOOK. 

for in all animals the bones are cartilaginous 
when young ; the breast should be broad 
and plump in all kinds of poultry, the feet 
pliable, and the toes easily broken when 
bent back. 

A SERVANT was Sent by her mistress during 
warm weather, for a piece of beef. The butcher 
forwarded it in due course ; but, on removing a 
portion of the suet, the indications of life which 
presented themselves were unmistakable. Next 
da}^ t)ie same girl was sent for a leg of lamb. 
"Are you sure it is sweet?" she inquired. " Per- 
fecth%" said the butcher, " the lamb was alive yes- 
terday." " So was the beef we had yesterday," was 
the reply. 



BOILED MEATS. 

67. A great deal of care and niceness 
is requisite in boiling meats. Your copper 
should be very clean and well tinned. All 
meats should be boiled slowly ; to boil them 
fast hardens the outside before the inside 
is warm, and dissolves the meat. For 
instance, a leg of veal of twelve pounds 
weight will require three hours and a half 



THE TOUXG life's COOK BOOK. 97 

boiling — the slower it boils the whiter and 
plu]7iper it will be. When you boil mut- 
ton or beef, observe to dredge them well 
with flour before you put them into the 
kettle of cold water ; keep it covered, and 
take oflf the scum. Mutton and beef do 
not require so much boiling, but veal, pork, 
or lamb, are not wholesome if they are 
not boiled eftough. A leg of pork w^ill 
require half an hour more of boiling than 
a leg of veal of the same weight. You 
must allow an hour for every four pounds 
weight of beef or mutton. The best way 
is to put your meat in when the water is 
cold. A leg of lamb of four pounds, 
weight will require an hour and a half 
boiling. 



BEEF.-HOAST BEEF, RIBS, OR SIRLOIN. 

68. Beef should be kept a week or ten 
days when the weather will permit. Wipe 
the joint with a clean cloth, envelope it in

quarter of an hour near; baste ; then with- 
draw it to a distance, and let it roast 
slowly till done ; baste frequently from 
the commencement; half an hour before 
serving take off the paper, dredge the beef 
slightly with hahed flour, and baste it with 
two ounces of dissolved butter; place the 
beef on a hot dish ; pour the dripping off; 
add a teacupful of boiling water and half 
a saltspoonful of salt to the gravy dripped 
from the beef; pour it into the dish ; gar- 
nish with horseradish, and serve at once. 
The time as follows : To be underdone, 
eleven minutes to the pound ; with the 
gravy in, fourteen minutes ; to be well 
done through, seventeen minutes ; in frosty 
weather, two minutes to be added in each 
case.

There are seven chances against even the most 
simple dish being presented to the mouth in abso- 
lute perfection. For instance, a roast of heef — 

1. The meat must be good. 

2. It must have been kept a good time. 

3. It must be roasted at a good fire. 

4. By a good cook. 

.5. Who must be in good temper. 

6. With all this felicitous combination you must 
have good luck, and 

T. Good appetite — the meat and the mouths which 
are to eat it must be ready for action at the same 
moment. 



BAKED BEEF, AND YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

69. Rub salt on a nice piece of beef, put 
it on bars which should fit your dripping 
pan, set it in the oven, with a gill of water 
in the pan, and when it is half done, make 
the pudding in the following manner : Beat 
four eggs very light; the yolks in a pan, 
the whites in a broad dish. When the 
yolks are thick stir in a pint of milk, and 
as much flour as will make a batter, but 
not a thick one. Then stir in the whites, 
which must be whisked very dry, do not 



100 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

beat tlie batter after the white is in; lastly, 
stir in a teaspoonful of dissolved carbonate 
of ammonia. Take out the meat, skim 
all the fat off the gravy, pour in the batter 
and replace the meat; put all into the 
oven again, and cook it till the pudding 
is done. You should make batter enough 
to cover your dripping pan about half an 
inch deep. When the meat is dished, cut 
the pudding in squares, and place it round 
the dish, the brown side up. 

Silent Contempt. — " What do you mean to do 
with K. ?" said a friend to Theodore Hook, alluding 
to a man who had grossly vilified him. " Do with 
him ;" replied Hook, "why I mean to let him alone 
most severely."

70. A round of beef is the best for this 
purpose. With a sharp knife cut incisions 
in the meat about an inch apart, and within 
one inch of the opposite side. Season it 
with pepper and salt, according to the size 



THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 101 

of the piece of meat. Make a dressing of 
butter, onion, and bread crumbs, in the 
proportion of a pint of crumbs, one small 
onion finely chopped, and an ounce of but- 
ter, with pepper and salt to the taste. Fill 
the incisions v/ith the dressing, put the 
meat in a pot with about a pint of water, 
and cover it tightly. Let it simmer six or 
eight hours. Some stick in a few cloves, 
and those who are fond of spice add all- 
spice. When the meat is done dish it up, 
and thicken the gravy with a little flour. 
Let it boil once, and serve it. This is ex- 
cellent when cold.

several places in tlie lean part — skewer it, 
and bind it close with tape. Have ready a 
deep pot — put the beef into it, and half 
cover it with water. Stew it four or five 
hours. Baste it constantly with the gravy, 
and turn it in the pot. When done, place 
it upon a dish and garnish it with force- 
meat balls, parsley, and carrots. Pour the 
gravy over it, having been previously 
flavored with Madeira wine. 

Let him that scoffeth at the lame, take care that 
he halt not himself. Whosoever speaketh of 
another's failings with pleasure, shall hear of his 
own with bitterness of heart. 



BOILED CORNED BEEF, No. 1. 

72. Put on the meat in cold water; 
allow one quart of water to every pound of 
meat. The slower it boils the better it will 
be. For every pound of meat, let it boil 
fifteen minutes. Thus, a piece of beef 
weighing twelve pounds, should boil three 
hours. If the beef is to be eaten cold, as 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 103 

soon as it is taken out of the pot immerse 

it in cold water for a short time, in order to 

retain the juices. Tongues are boiled in 

the same manner. 

A MILD answer to an Singry man, like water cast

CORNED BEEF, No. 2. 

73. Corned beef should be pujb on in 
cold water, allowing a quart of water to 
every pound of meat. Boil it slowly, and 
when done serve it with turnips and po- 
tatoes. If the beef is to be eaten cold, im- 
merse it for a few minutes in cold water as 
soon as it is taken from the pot. 

" Will you dine with me to-morrow, Mr. ?"

HOASTED BEEF'S TONGUE. 

74. Soak a fresh tongue for several 
hours in strong salt and water, and then 
drain it well. Boil it slowly for two hours, 
take off the skin and roast it, and while 
cooking baste it with butter. Serve with 
currant jelly. 

One morning a party came into the public rooms 
at Buxton, somewhat later than usual, and re- 
quested some tongue. They were told that Lord 
Byron had eaten it all. " I am very angry with 
his lordship," said a lady, loud enough for him to 
hear the observation. " I am sorry for it, madam," 
retorted Lord Byron, " but before I ate the tongue 
I was assured you did not want it." 



BEEF'S HEART, STUFFED. 

75. Trim and clean the heart, and 
sprinkle salt over it, and let it stand for 
two or three hours to draw out all the 
blood. The water should be changed two 
or three times. Then wipe it dry, and fill 
the cavities with a dressing made of crumbs 
of bread, pepper, salt, and a little onion

cliopped fine. Put to ihivS as much butter 
as will make the crumbs adhere together. 
Set it in a moderate oven and bake it, 
allowing a quarter of an hour for each 
pound. If convenient, it is better roasted 
before the fire. 

There are some members of the community that 
are like the crumb in the mouth — if they go the 
right way they afford a little nourishment, but if 
they happen to go the wrong way they cause a deal 
of trouble. 



BEEF, LIKE GAME. 

76. Cut some slices of beef into square 
pieces, put on each a strip of bacon, dredge 
flour over, bind each with twine, or skewer 
them into a rolled shape. Fry them in 
butter. When brown, add shalots, a slice 
of lemon-peel, a spoonful of capers, two 
bay-leaves, salt, spice, a glassful of wine, 
half a glassful of vinegar, and a little 
water. Stew till done.

ITALIAN BEEFSTEAK. 

77. Score a steak transversely with a 
sharp knife without cutting it through. 
Lay it in a stew-pan with a small piece 
of butter; season with pepper, salt, and 
an onion chopped very fine. Let it cook 
in its own gravy for about three-quarters 
of an hour and serve. 

To TAKE Rust out of Steel, — Cover the steel 
with sweet oil, well rubbed on it, and in forty-eight 
hours use unslaked lime finely powdered, to rub 
until all the rust disappears. 



STEWED BEEFSTEAKS. 

78. Put the steak with a lump of butter 
into a stew pan over a slow fire, and turn 
it until the butter has become a fine white 
gravy, then pour it into a basin, and put 
more butter to the steak. When the steak 



THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 107 

is nicely done, take it out, return all the 
gravy into the stew-pan, and fry the steak ; 
then add it to the gravy in the stew-pan, 
with a tablespoonful of wine, and a shalot 
finely sliced ; stew it for ten minutes, and 
serve it up. Or, fry the steak slightly at 
first, then put it into half a pint of water, 
an onion sliced, a spoonful of walnut 
ketchup, pepper and salt, cover it close, 
thicken it with flour and butter, and serve 
it up very hot.

79. Cut the steak rather thick ; brown 
it in a frying-pan with butter. Add half a 
pint of water, an onion sliced, pepper and 
salt, cover the pan close, and let it stew 
very slowly for one hour ; then add a glass

two of oysters, their liquor having been 
previously strained and put into the stew- 
pan. 



BEEFSTEAK, WITH POTATOES. 

80. Cut the steaks into thin slices, beat 
and season them with pepper and salt, dip 
them into a little melted butter and broil 
them. When done, put them into a dish 
before the fire, and fry potatoes to a fine 
brown color. Serve with the following mix- 
ture laid underneath ; parsley chopped fine, 
a small piece of butter, pepper and salt. 

Shortly after the commencement of the last war, 
a tax was laid on candles, which, as a political 
economist would prove, made them dearer. A 
Scotch wife, in Greenock, remarked to her chandler, 
Paddy Macbeth, that the price was raised, and 
asked why. " It's owin' to the wars," said Paddy. 
" The war I" said the astonished matron, " gracious

FRIED BEEFSTEAK WITH WINE. 

81. Fry the steak over a quick fire, 
until it is of a fine brown. Wlien done, 
place it in a hot dish before tlie fire, add to 
the gravy in the pan a wineglassful of port 
wine, some pepper and salt. As soon as it 
boils, pour it over the steak and serve very 
hot. 

Happiness, like every other precious good must 
be sought for. Some people, to be sure, are born 
like sunshine — they are naturall}' pleasant and light- 
hearted ; but these are few and far between, and

not you be as cheerful as the}^ ? They have their 
trials and private anno3"ances as well as you, and 
with effort you can cull as man}'^ flowers and catch

BEEFSTEAK FRIED. 

82. Fry the steaks in butter for twelve 
or fifteen minutes, until they are of a fine

pieces about an inch square, pare and slice 
six onions ; put a layer of the meat and a 
layer of onions in a stew-pan, with salt and 
pepper and a little flour alternately, till all 
is in, and add half a teacupful of water; 
cover it closely and set it on a slow fire to 
stew; when about half done, if the gravy 
seems too thin, add one ounce of butter 
rolled in flour; but if it should be thick 
enough, add the butter without the flour. 
When tomatoes are in season two tomatoes 
may be cut in small pieces and stewed with 
the meat. Cold beef may be cooked in the

Excessive Politeness. — Queen Elizabeth was 
once making a journe}^ in England, and on her ap- 
proaching the city of Coventry, the mayor, with a 
numerous cavalcade, went out to meet her. On 
their return the3^had to pass through a wide brook, 
and the mayor's horse, being thirsty, attempted 
several times to drink, but his cavalier prevented 
him. The queen, observing it, said to him : '* Pray, 
Mr. Mayor, permit 3'our horse to drink." The'mayor, 
bowing, very humbly, replied : " Madam, it would 
be the height of presumption for my unworthy 
horse to drink, till your majesty's royal steed has 
satisfied his thirst." 



FRENCH STEW, No. 2. 



84. Cut up two pounds of beef, and 
add to it a pint of sliced tomatoes. The 
tomatoes must be peeled. Put the meat in 
a stew-pan and season it well with pepper 
and salt; then add your tomatoes, and an 
ounce of butter rolled in flour. Cover it 
closely, and let it simmer till the beef is 
tender. It does not require any water, as 
the tomatoes are sufficiently juicy. If the 
gravy should not be thick enough, add a 
little flour mixed with cold water.

BEEFSTEAK WITH CUCUMBERS. 

85. Pare and slice lengthwise two large 
cucumbers and a large onion. Season them 
with pepper and salt, dredge flour over 
them, and fry them. Broil a steak, season 
it with pepper and salt, and put it into a 
hot dish with a bit of butter; then pour 
the cucumbers over it, and serve hot.

BEEF'S KIDNEY, FRIED. 

86. Kidneys require a longer time to 
dress, in proportion to their bulk, than any 
other parts of animals; and beef kidneys 
more than those of sheep, lambs, etc. Beef 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 113 

kidneys may be fried in the following man- 
ner : Trim, and cut the kidney into slices ; 
dredge them well with flour, and season 
with salt, pepper, and Cayenne. Fry on 
both sides ; and as the slices are done, re- 
move them from the pan, and make a gravy 
with a small slice of butter, a dessert-spoon- 
ful of flour, pepper, and salt, and a little 
boiling water. Add a little mushroom 
catchup, lemon-juice, walnut pickle, or any 
sauce that will impart a good flavor. Some 
add to the gravy, at the last moment, a 
glass of white wine. Serve with small 
slices of fried bread. 



NICE PATTIES FROM UNDER-DONE BEEF. 

87. Cut the beef into small pieces; 
season with pepper, salt, and a little chop- 
ped onion ; make a plain paste, and roll it 
out thin ; fill it with meat, and bake it a 
light brown.

UNDER-DONE BEEF SERVED AS STEAKS. 

88. Cut the meat in slices an inch and 
a half thick, securing a good proportion of 
fat. Lay them on a gridiron over a good 
lire ; turn often, but do not stick a fork into 
them. As soon as brown, lay them on a 
very hot dish, and add salt and pepper, and 
pour over some hot gravy of the joint. If 
the seasoning is added while the meat is 
being boiled, the latter will be hardened 
and the pieces wasted. The steaks will be 
found excellently served with sliced fried 
potatoes round it. 

Two Gentlemen were talking in a coffee-house 
of the best method of dressing a beefsteak. One 
of them observed, that, of all receipts, the one given

intended death of the king, is the best : 

'' If it were done, when 'tis done, thep 'twere well 
it were done quickly."

BROILED BEEF'S HEART. 

89. Cut the heart lengthwise, in slices 
not thicker than half an inch. Soak them 
in salt and water until all the blood is 
drawn out ; then wipe them dry, and sea- 
son well with pepper and salt. Broil them 
slowly, over or before a clear fire; and 
when thoroughly done they should be 
served with currant jelly. 



HASHES. 

90. A hash is a very convenient mode 
of disposing of cold meat, but without due 
attention is an indigestible preparation. 
The cook must always remember that the 
meat has been once cooked, and must now 
be very lightly done, or it will be tough 
and hard, unsuited for delicate stomachs. 
Meat that has been a little underdone the 
first time is the best for this purpose ; the 
gravy should be first heated, and the meat 



116 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 



merely simmered in it afterwards. The 
meat should be cut in thin slices, or small 
pieces, then all the sinews, skin, gristle, 
and bone, must be put into a saucepan with 
a little water, salt and pepper, a fried 
onion, a small piece of butter blended with 
a tablespoonful of flour, a little thyme and 
parsley, and a single clove, if the has]i be 
beef. Let it boil down to three fourths of 
the quantity, then strain off the gravy, and 
flavor it with a little ketchup or Worcester 
sauce, put in the sliced meat, and make it 
hot over the fire, taking great care that it 
does not boil, and serve with toasted bread. 
No flavor or condiment should unduly pre- 
dominate in this or any other kind of 
cookery; especially, to allow onions or 
garlic to be perceptible is an ofience against 
good taste, the laws of cookery, and even 
those of health. The mushroom flavor is 
the most approved and delicate in what 
are called made dishes, yet it should always 
be so sklfully used, that only the aroma 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 117 

should be distinguished. This should be 
particularly attended to in all dishes com- 
posed of veal or fowls. 

A MAID servant was dismissed on account of her

onion and a dessertspoonful of minced 
parsley ; when thoroughly browned, add a 
seasoning of pepper, salt and nutmeg, and 
put to it half a pint of water. Place in 
the beef, cut it into small but thick slices ;

is reduced to one half; strain the bones 
from the gravy ; pour the latter back into 
the stew-pan : season the meat with pepper 
and salt, and a little mace if preferred ; 
put it with the gravy in the stew-pan, and 
add two or three raw potatoes pared and 
sliced; put the stew over the fire, and 
when the potatoes are done dish it up. 

Small squares of toasted bread may be

The following is a good story about a clergyman, 
who lost his horse one Saturday evening. After 
hunting for it in company with a boy until midnight, 
he gave up in despair. The next day he took for 
his text the following passage from Job : " Oh, that 
I knew where I might find him !" The boy, who 
had just come in, supposing the horse was still the 
burden of thought, cried out, "I know where he is, 
sir — he's in Tom Smith's stable!" 



A DISH FROM COLD BEEF AND MASHED 
POTATOES. 

93. Cut the cold meat into small slices 
about half an inch thick. Season the slices, 
and spread thinly over them some bread 
crumbs and some small lumps of butter. 
Take the gravy left from the joint, or stew 
a gravy from the bones; thicken it with 
butter rolled in flour, and season it with 
pepper and salt. Or the bits of meat, when 
not large enough to be sliced, as above, 
may be minced, seasoned, and mixed with 
mashed potatoes and flour. Make it into 
small cakes, and fry them a nice brown.

95. Take a piece of a sirloin of beef, 
or of a leg of mutton — (these parts are 
recommended, but any other parts may be 
used) — cut into slices of equal thickness, 
and boil them quickly over a clear fire until

slightly brown ; lay them upon a dish be- 
fore the fire to keep hot ; then poach some 
eggs and lay around the meat — and serve 
with mashed potatoes. It is proper to ob- 
serve that the under-done parts of meat are 
only suitable for this purpose. 

Charles the Second gave the name to the piece 
of beef called the " sirloin." Having dined from a 
loin, and being well pleased with the joint, he asked 
its name ; and being told that it was a loin of beef,

its ; then, extending his sword over it, he exclaimed,

ECONOMICAL STEW. 

96. Slice some cold beef or mutton, 
season the meat with pepper and salt, and

if there be none left, add a little water. 
Slice an onion fine, and add to it also a few 
potatoes. Stew gently until the meat is 
quite tender. If there was no cold gravy,

Sheridan was once taken ill in consequence of a 
fortnight's continued dining-out and dissipation. He

calling again soon afterward, he asked his patient

being in the affirmative, " Kight," said the doctor ; 
" 'tis the only way to secure 3^ou length of days." 
" I do not doubt it," said Sheridan, " for these last 
three days, since I began, have been the longest to

LUNCH FROM COLD EOAST BEEF. 

97. When the beef has been cooked 
rare, and the bones have considerable meat 
adhering to them, cut them apart, and 
crack or saw each one in pieces about four 
inches long. Grease the gridiron and broil 
them quickly, taking care not to burn them. 
Poached or fried eggs and mashed potatoes 
are suitable accompaniments.

"RISSOLES" OF COLD BEEF, MUTTON, OR 
VEAL. 

98. Mince some cold beef or mutton, 
season it to the taste with pepper and salt, 
and moisten it with some mushroom or 
w^alnut catsup. Beat the yolks of a couple 
of eggs, make the meat into small cakes, 
dip them into the egg, and then into some 
nicely-seasoned bread crumbs. Fry them a 
nice light brown on both sides. Cold veal 
may be dressed in the same way, but is 
nicer with a little cold ham grated and 
mixed with it.

a little beef gravy. Cover the whole with 
a thick paste of the potatoes. Score the 
potato crust with the point of a knife, in 
squares of equal size. Put the dish in an 
oven and brown it on all sides. When 
nicely browned serve immediately. This, 
with an apple-tart or dumpling to follow, is 
a capital dinner for a small family.

METHOD OF DRESSING COLD SIRLOIN OF 
BEEF. 

100. Cut the under-done parts of the

thick, leaving, if possible, a little fat at- 
tached to each piece. Season with salt and 
mixed spices, dredge with flour, and heat

little vinegar may be added. The slices 
may be boiled, and served with fried or

There can be no objection to broils in the house, 
so that they emanate only from the kitchen. 



COLD POTATOES AND BEEF. 

101. Slice the beef and the potatoes ; 
put an onion to a good gravy, either from

"My dear," said a j^oung wife, returning from a 
ball, " I have learned one of the most difficult steps." 
"There is a step," replied the husband, "the most 
valuable of all ; but it is one, I fear, you will never 
care to learn." " Indeed ! what can that be ?" " It 
is to step into the kitchen P^

COLD BEEF, MUTTON OR VEAL, RECOOKED. 

102. Take a pound or more of cold 
meat and chop it very fine; add a small 
piece of butter, with salt and pepper; mix 
all well together. Boil six fresh eggs 
twenty minutes ; lay them in cold water, 
and take oS the shells ; mash the yolks 
very fine and add them to the meat. Make 
it into small cakes, roll them in flour or fine 
bread crumbs, and fry them in butter or 
good lard. 

When you have lost money in the streets, every 
one is ready to help j^ou to look for it ; but when 
you have lost your character, every one leaves you 
to recover it as you can. 



TURNOVERS OF COLD MEAT. 

103. Cut any kind of cold meat into 
small pieces, and season well with pepper 
and salt, and add a little finely-chopped 
onion if liked. Take some cold potatoes, 
grate them, beat an egg and put to them, 



THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 127 

and dust in as much flour as will form a 
dough. Roll this out about the ordinary 
thickness for pies, put on a portion of this 
paste some of the seasoned meat, fold the 
edges of the paste and pinch them together 
so as to hold the meat, and fry them on 
both sides a fine brown. 



"TOAD IN THE HOLE" FROM COLD MEAT. 

104. Take some rather thick slices of 

cold under-done beef, seasoning with salt 

and pepper. Make a batter by beating the 

whites and yolks separately of four eggs. 

To a pint of milk add the yolks of the eggs, 

and enough flour to make a batter. Lastly 

put in a little salt, and stir in gradually the 

whites of the eggs. Pour the batter into a 

deep baking dish, and lay the meat on the 

top. Set it in the oven and bake it a nice 

brown.

BEEF BAKED IN FORMS. 

105. Mince very fine equal quantities 
of cold roast beef and tongue. Season well 
with pepper and salt, and add the whole or 
a part of a well-beaten egg, according to the 
quantity of meat. Mix it well, and butter 
a mould ; put in the meat and press it 
down very hard, to acquire the shape of 
the mould : then turn it out on a baking 
tin, and wash it over with some well-beaten 
egg. Set it in the oven to brown. 

" My dear," inquired a 3'oung wife of her hus- 
band, as she turned up her rosy little mouth to be 
kissed, "have you seen the magnificent set of wal- 
nut furniture which the Jenkinses have just bought?" 
" Hem ! No, love, but I've seen the bill, which quite 
satisfies me I" 



A FRICASSEE FROM FRAGMENTS OF COLD 
BEEF. 

106. Cut the meat into thin slices, and 
free them from fat ; take some cold gravy 
and thicken it with butter rolled in flour ;

and for seasoning use young onions, pepper, 
and salt. Put it in a stew-pan, and as soon 
as it begins to boil it may be served. If 
something a little better is required, add a 
glass of port wine, the yolk of an egg beaten, 
and the juice of a lemon. Stir the fricassee, 
but do not allow it to boil. 

A GOOD housewife should not be a person of one 
idea, but should be familiar with the flower garden 
as well as the flour barrel ; and though her lesson 
should be to lessen expense, the odor of a fine rose 
should not be less valuable than the order of her 
household. She will prefer a yard of shrubbery to 
a yard of satin. If her husband is a skilful sower 
of grain, she is equall}^ skilful as a sewer of gar- 
ments. He keeps his hoes bright by use — she keeps 
the hose of the family in order. 



A NICE BREAKFAST, LUNCHEON, OR SUPPER 
RELISH FROM POTTED COLD BEEF. 

107. Having a joint of dressed beef 

which cannot be consumed, proceed in the 

following manner. Drain the meat from 

the gravy, cut it in pieces, and chop it fine. 

Season with pepper, salt, and spices to the

PIE MADE OF COLD ROAST BEEF. 

108. Cut about half a pound of cold 
under-done beef into small pieces ; add 
pepper and salt to the taste. Line a deep 
pie dish with paste ; put in a layer of meat. 
Over this strew some finely-minced onion, 
dredge flour over it, then add another layer 
of meat, onion, and flour, till the pie is full. 
Pour in a little water, and on the top layer 
lay some lumps of butter. Cover the top 
with paste, leaving a hole in the centre. 
Bake it, and serve w4th oyster sauce ; or, 
in place of the onions, layers of oysters 
may be substituted.

Quantity of Food. — The proper quantity of food 
to be taken at a meal is best regulated by a person's 
own feelings. If we find that we dined too freely 
to-day, to-morrow we should reduce the quantity 
one-third ; and if that is not sufficient, a further 
reduction of a third should be made — and so on 
until a proper standard is arrived at. To satisty 
the appetite it is not necessary to eat to repletion, 
but at the conclusion of the meal a person should 
always feel as though he could eat more. 



COLD BEEF HASHED WITH VINEGAR. 

109. Take some cold roast beef, beef- 
steak, or the meat from a shin which has 
been boiled for soup ; cut it in pieces about 
half an inch square; season with Cayenne 
pepper and salt to the taste. Take as much 
vinegar as would cover the meat ; boil in it 
a few grains of whole allspice and a couple 
of cloves ; pour it over the meat while boil- 
ing hot, and stand it away to get cold. 
This is a nice dish for supper or luncheon. 

A PRUDENT wife is a treasure, and an active one

BEEF CAKES. 

110. Take some cold beef — that which 
is under-done is the best — mince it very 
fine, and grate a little uncooked ham into 
it, enough to flavor it. Season it with 
pepper and salt. Mix the whole together 
and make it out into small cakes, flour 
them, and fry them a nice brown on both 
sides. 



THE ONLY "COLD SHOULDER" WHICH CAN BE 
SHOWN TO A FRIEND WITHOUT OFFENCE. 

111. A shoulder of lamb, or a part of 
one, being left cold, proceed in the follow- 
ing manner. Score the shoulder in squares, 
rub it with the yolk of an egg, pepper and 
salt it, and rub with bread crumbs and 
sweet herbs. Broil it over a clear fire — or 
put it in an oven until nicely browned. 
Send it to table with sauce made of a half 
a pint of gravy, to which has been added 
an ounce of fresh butter rubbed into a table- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 133 

spoonful of flour, the same of mushroom or 
wahiut catsup, two teaspoonsful of lemon 
juice, one of black pepper, a quarter of a 
rind of lemon grated very fine, a little Chili 
vinegar, or a few grains of Cayenne — sim- 
mer together for a few minutes, pour a little 
of the sauce over the meat, and send up the 
rest in a tureen. The sauce may be sim- 
plified at discretion if the above ingredients 
are not all at hand. A cold shoulder ot 
mutton, having only a little meat upon the 
blade bone, may be dressed in the same 
way. Serve with caper sauce poured over 
it, or melted butter, in which should be 
mixed some mushroom catchup and lemon 
juice, about a table-spoonful of each.

MUTTON CUTLETS WITH PORTUGUESE 
SAUCE. 

112. Take ^ve or six cutlets oJBf the 
best end of a neck of mutton ; trim off the 
fat, bare the bone, and beat the cutlets 
with a chopper. Season two ounces of 
fine crumbs of bread with the eighth part 
of a nutmeg grated, a salt-spoonful of salt, 
half a salt-spoonful of pepper, and a quarter 
of a grain of Cayenne. Dip the cutlets 
into beaten egg (one), then into the crumbs, 
and fry slowly in plenty of boiling fat till 
of a pale brown color, fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Peel and chop fine an onion, a 
large apple, half a clove of garlic, six 
Sultana raisins ; put them into a saucepan 
with a wine-glassful of vinegar, a tea-spoon- 
ful of moist sugar, a table-spoonful of gravy, 
one clove, and four pepper-corns. Simmer 
twenty minutes. Add a wine-glassful of

church wardens of Wallingford replied: — "He 
preaches the gospel, but does not keep a car- 
riage I" 



MUTTON CHOP. 



113. To cook a mutton chop well is a 
great art„^ They should not be cut too thin, 
and should be done over a nice bright coal 
fire. They will take from eight to ten 
minutes. When the fat is transparent, and 
the lean feels hard, the chop is done. It 
should be served on a very hot plate, and 
with a nice mealy potato, hot. In dressing 
a chop never stick a fork into it. Tomato 
sauce is likewise served with it. 

Be always more ready to forgive than to return 
an injury.

MUTTON CHOPS WITH LEMON. 

114. Wash the chops, wipe them dry, 
grease the bars of your gridiroii;, and broil 
them over hot coals. When they are done, 
lay them on a dish and season them with 
pepper and salt, and baste them with but- 
ter; peel and slice lemons, lay a slice on 
each chop, and send them to the table. 
This is the French method of serving them. 

Memory is not so brilliant as hope, but it is more 
beautiful, and a thousand times as true. 



IRISH STEW. 



115. About two pounds of the best end 
of a neck of mutton cut into neat chops ; 
season with three saltspoonsful of black 
pepper, and the same of salt ; slice thin 
three onions, put them in a stew-pan ; 
place the mutton closely over; pour in 
just sufficient cold water to reach, but 
not quite cover the mutton. Let it boil up. 



THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 137 

Skim and simmer very gently for an hour 

and a quarter. Peel two pounds of mealy 

potatoes (all the same size), wash them, and 

place them on the mutton. Simmer half

CUERIED BOILED MUTTON. 

116. Cut into neat slices three quarters 
of a pound of cold boiled mutton. Sprinkle 
over it a teaspoonful of salt, two dessert- 
spoonsful of curry powder, and a table- 
spoonful of flour ; chop one onion quite fine 
and add that. Put the mutton into a stew- 
pan with half a pint of gravy if you have 
it, and if not, water. Shake the pan fre- 
quently, and let it simmer very gently for 
an hour and a half. Wash half a pound 
of rice, and boil it in a quart of water for

twenty-five minutes, drain it on a sieve, and 
put it into the oven for five minutes to dry. 
Place the rice round the dish neatly, and 
put the curry in the centre. Serve very 
hot, and with it a glass of mixed pickles, 
separate.

A VERY NICE DISH OF COLD LAMB AND 
CUCUMBERS, OR SPINACH. 

117. Fry slices or chops of cold lamb 
till they are slightly browned ; dip the 
slices in bread crumbs, chopped parsley, 
and yolk of egg. Some grated lemon and 
a little nutmeg may be added. Fry them, 
and pour a little good gravy over them 
when served. The various methods of 
redressing mutton are applicable generally 
to lamb. 

A LADY who made pretensions to refined feelings, 
went to her butcher to remonstrate with him on

so barbalous as to put innocent little lambs to 
death?" "Why not, madam?" said the butcher, 
" you wouldn't eat 'em alive, would you ?" 



A NICE HASH OF MUTTON. 

118. Add to some cold gravy some 
finely-chopped onion and half a pint mush 
rooms. Boil the whole gently with some 
cold mutton cut in small pieces. Thicken 
the gravy with a little flour and butter. 

FooTE, dining at the house of Mrs. Thrale, found 
nothing to his liking, and sat in expectation of 
something better. A neck of mutton being the last 
thing, he refused it, as he had the other dishes. As

standing that there was nothing more, Foote called 
out to him, " Hello, John ! bring that back again — 
I find it's neck or riothing .^"

Directions for Selecting Veal. — Veal 
may be known to be good by being fat, 
not too large, firm in the flesh, and of 
white color. If the flesh be flabby, or 
discolored by green or yellow spots, the 
meat should be rejected — it is, or soon will 
be, unfit for eating. The jDrime joints of

oven, and bake it until the potatoes are a 
fine brown. Serve it in the dish it was 
baked in. 



BOILED LEG OF LAMB. 

127. Trim off all the loose fat, cut off 
the shank, wash and wipe it dry ; dredge it 
with flour and tie it in a clean cloth ; put it 
in boiling water enough to cover it. The 
water should be salted in the proportion of 
two teaspoonsfu! of salt to a quart of water. 
Let it boil from two to three hours accord- 
ing to its size. Serve it with drawn butter 
or rich parsley sauce, whichever may be 
preferred, and vegetables of any kind which 
may be in season. 

Leaf Impressions. — To take perfect impressions 
of the leaves of plants, the following process should 
be adopted: Hold oiled paper in the smoke of a 
lamp, or of pitch, until it becomes coated with the 
smoke : to this paper apply the leaf of which you 
wish the impression taken, having previousl}^ warmed 
it between j^our hands, to render it pUable. Place 
the lower surface of the leaf upon the blackened 
surface of the oiled paper, in order that the numer^ 



THE YOUNG TTIFe's COOK BOOK. 147 

ous veins which are so prominent on this side may 
receive from the paper a portion of the smoke. Lay 
a paper over the leaf, and then press it gently upon 
the smoked paper, either with the fingers or, better 
still, with a small roller, covered with woollen cloth, 
or some soft material, so that every part of the leaf 
may come in contact with the soap on the oiled 
paper : a coating of smoke will thus adhere to the 
leaf. Then remove the leaf carefully, and place the 
blackened surface on a sheet of clean white paper, 
covering the leaf with a clean slip of paper, and 
pressing upon it with the fingers on the roller as be- 
fore. Thus may be obtained the impression of a 
leaf, showing its perfect outlines and veins, more 
accurately than in the most careful drawing; 



CUTLETS OF COLD ROAST LAMB OR MUTTON. 

128. Slice the cold meat of an under- 
done joint of lamb or mutton ; dip them into 
egg and well-seasoned bread crumbs, and 
broil or fry them over a quick fire, that they 
may be browned and heated through, with- 
out being overdone. 

A GENTLEMAN, at an eating-house asked the per-

be examined upon application for a statute of lunacy 
against him, the Chancellor asked him, " How many 
legs has a sheep?" "Does 3'our Lordship mean," 

answered B , " a live sheep or a dead one ?" 

"Is it not the same thing?" said the Chancellor. 

"No, my lord," said Lord B , "there is mm^h 

difference ; a live sheep has four, a dead one but two : 
there are but two legs of mutton — the others are 
shoulders." 



A NICE RAGOUT FROM COLD LAMB. 

131. Separate the lamb from the bones, 
and cut into convenient pieces; lard with 
bacon fried of a light brown, and stew very 
lightly in mutton gravy, sufficient to cover 
it ; season with sweet herbs, pepper, salt, 
and spice. Strain off the gravy; keeping 
the meat hot, and add to it some oysters ; 
half a glass of port wine ; a few mushrooms, 
and a bit of butter rolled in flour ; the juice 
of half a lemon ; boil together for a few min- 
utes in the gravy, and pour the sauce over 
the lamb. Mutton may be served in the 
same way.

cut it very small, some grated bread, a 
little beef suet, two eggs, a little milk, some 
nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix it well 
together, and stuff the thin part of the 
breast with some of it — the rest make up 
into little balls and fry. Skewer the skin 
close down, flour, and boil it in a cloth in 
milk and water. Make some gravy of the 
ends that were cut off, with half a pint of 
oysters, the juice of a lemon, and a piece 
of butter rolled in flour. When the veal is 
done, put it in the dish, garnish it with the 
balls, and pour the sauce over it.

A BREAST OF VEAL IN HODGE-PODGE. 

133. Cut the brisket of a breast of 
veal into little pieces, and every bone 
asunder ; then flour it, and put half a 
pound of butter into a stew-pan. When it 
is hot throw it into the veal, fry it all over 
a light brown, and then have ready a tea- 
kettle of boiling water; pour it into the 
stew-pan, fill it up, and stir it round. 
Throw in a pint of green peas, a whole 
lettuce washed clean, two or three blades 
of mace, a little whole pepper tied in a 
muslin rag, a little bundle of sweet herbs, 
a small onion stuck with a few cloves, and 
a little salt. Cover it close and let it stew 
an hour, or till it be boiled to your palate, 
if you would have soup made of it ; but if 
you would have only sauce to eat with the 
veal, you must stew it till there is just as 
much as you would have for sauce, and 
season it with salt to your palate. Take 
out the onion, sweet herbs and spice, and

pour it altogether into your dish. If you 
have no peas, pare three or four cucumbers, 
scoop out the pulp, and cut thin pieces; 
then take four or five heads of celery 
washed clean, and cut the white part 
small. When you have no lettuces, take 
the little hearts of savoys, or the little 
young sprouts. If you would make a very 
fine dish of it, fill the inside of your lettuce 
with forcemeat, and tie the top close with a 
thread, and stew it till there be just enough 
for the sauce. Set the lettuce in the middle 
and the veal round. Pour the sauce all 
over it. Garnish your dish with rasped 
bread made into figures with your fingers. 



ROAST VEAL. 

34-, Season a breast of veal with 
pepper and salt; skewer the sweetbread 
firmly in its place, flour the meat, and 
roast it slowly before a moderate fire for 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 153 

about four hours. It should be of a fine 
Drown, but not dry. Baste it with butter. 
When done, put the gravy in a stew-pan, 
add a piece of butter rolled in browned 
flour, and if there should not be quite 
enough gravy add a little more water, with 
pepper and salt to the taste. The gravy 
should be brown. 

Since the days that are past are gone forever, and 
those that are to come may not come to thee, it 
behoveth thee, O man, to employ the present time, 
without regretting tlie loss of that which is past, 
or too much depending on that which is to come. 



BAKED FILLET OF VEAL. 

135. Make incisions all around the 
bone, as closely as possible so as not to 
touch each other. Make a dressing of 
bread crumbs, an onion finely chopped, a 
little sweet marjoram, pepper and salt to 
the taste, with enough butter to cause the 
bread crumbs to adhere together. Fill 
these incisions with the dressing, season the 



154 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

meat with pepper and salt, and skewer the 
strip of fat around it. Pour in enough 
water to cover the bottom of the pan, put 
in the rack, and place the meat on it. As 
the gravy stews away add a little more 
water. Put it in a cool oven and let it cook 
three or four hours. When done, make the 
gravy with some flour rolled in butter, and 
add pepper and salt to the taste. 

He that watches for an opportunity of revenge, 
lieth in wait against himself, and draweth down 
mischief on his own head. 



FRIED VEAL WITH TOMATOES. 

136. Cut some veal in thin slices, 
season it, and fry it of a nice brown. 
Have ready some tomatoes which have 
been stewed very dry, pass them through a 
sieve to take out the seeds, then put them 
into the pan in which the meat has been 
fried, and add butter enough to make a rich 
gravy. Pour them hot over the veal and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 155 

serve it. Beef is excellent, cooked in the 
same way. 

To be satisfied with a little is the greatest 
wisdom, and he that increaseth his riches iiicreas- 
eth his cares; but a contented mind is a hidden- 
treasure, and trouble findeth it not. 



FILLET OF VEAL A-LA-MODK 

137. Cut deep incisions in the meat 
about an inch apart, and season it with 
pepper and salt. Make your dressing with 
a four-cent baker's loaf, two small onions 
finely chopped, and an ounce of butter, 
with pepper and salt to the taste. Fill the 
incisions with this dressing, put the veal in 
a pot with three gills of water, and cover it 
tightly. Let it cook slowly two hours at 
least. Some prefer a little sweet marjoram 
or thyme, finely powdered, added to the 
dressing. Take out the veal when it is 
done, and thicken the gravy with a little 
flour. 



156 THE YOUNG wife's COOK BOOK. 
SPICED VEAL. 

138. Cut some of the thick part of a 
cold loin of veal into pieces about an inch 
square. Pour over it as much spiced vine- 
gar as will cover it. It may be eaten hot or 
cold. To spice the vinegar : To two gills 
of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of Cayenne 
pepper, a little salt, a teaspoonful of ground 
allspice, two cloves, and a sprig of mace. 
Boil the spices in the vinegar and pour over 
the veal boiling hot. Cold beef will answer 
instead of veal. 

A Traitor's Reward. — Graveston, who betrayed 
the Spaniards at Bergen-op-Zoom to Queen Eliza- 
beth, afterwards came to England to give her majesty 
an account of his success and to claim his reward. 
The queen gave him a thousand crowns, but said at 
the same time, " Get you home, that I may know 
where to send when I want a thorough paced villian. " 



VEAL POT PIE. 

139. Cut up some veal, the best part of 
the neck is preferable to any other, wash 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 157 

and season it with pepper and salt ; line the 
sides of your pot with paste, put in the veal 
with some pieces of paste rolled out and cut 
in squares, cut up some pieces of butter 
rolled in flour and add to it, pour in as much 
water as will cover it, and lay a sheet of 
paste on the top, leaving an opening in the 
centre; put the lid on the pot and put it 
over a moderate fire, let it cook slowly till 
the meat is done ; place the soft crust on a 
dish, then put the meat over it, and on the 
top lay the hard crust, with the brown side 
up. Serve the gravy in a boat. To have 
the crust of a pot pie brown, set the pot on 
a few coals before the fire, and turn it fre- 
quently. 

The wise man cultivates his mind with know- 
ledge, the improvement of arts is his delight, and 
their utility to the public crowneth him with honor. 



SCOTCH KIDNEY-COLLGPS. 

140. Let the kidney be very fresh ; cut 
it in pieces the size of very small steaks; 



15S THE YOUNG TflFE'S COOK BOOK. 

soak the slices in warm water, and dry 
them well. Dust them with flour,, and 
brown them in a stew-pan wdth fresh 
butter. When browned, pour a little hot 
water into the pan, four young onions 
minced, with salt, pepper, Cayenne, shred 
parsley, and a little vinegar, or onion-pickle 
vinegar. Cover the stew-pan close, and let 
the collops simmer slowly for two hours or 
more. 

Rossini had accepted an invitation to dine with 
a certain lady whose dinners were known to be 
arranged on a severely economical scale. The din- 
ner ottered to the maestro formed no exception to 
the general rule, and he left the table rather hungry. 
" I hope you will soon do me the honor to dine 
with me again," said the lady. " Oh, yes, immedi- 
ately, if you like," was the reply. 



MINCED VEAL. 

141. This is one of the most agreeable, 
simple, inexpensive and wholesome of made 
dishes. The meat from any joint of veal is 
available, and every part may be used, some 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 159 

people not even objecting to a little fat. It 
must all be cut away from the bones and 
nicely minced. The brown outside, the 
gristles, and the bones (broken up), must 
be boiled into a gravy, with a little salt, 
pepper, and a blade of mace ; then strained 
o£f, and with the minced meat put into a 
stewpan with a teaspoonful of grated lemon- 
peel, the same quantity of lemon-juice, a 
tablespoonful of cream, and a piece of butter 
blended with flour. As soon as perfectly 
hot through, the mince should be poured 
out upon the dish, lined with toast. 



FRENCH STEW OF VEAL. 

142. Boil a knuckle of veal in just 
enough water to cover it, with a little salt. 
When the veal is tender, pour off the water 
it was boiled in and save it. Cut the veal 
in small pieces, and put it in a pan with 
the w^ater it was boiled in. Add to this two 



IGO THE YOUNG WIFES COOK BOOK. 

hard-boiled eggs chopped very fine, a table- 
spoonful of allspice in grains (which should 
be crushed, but not broken fine), a quarter 
of a pound of butter, a little mace, and 
pepper and salt to the taste. Stir two 
tablespoonsful of flour smoothly in a little 
water, and pour into it. Set it over the 
fire, let it boil for two or three minutes, 
pour in two glasses of wine, and serve 
it hot. 

In all th}^ desires let reason go along with thee, 

and fix not thy hopes beyond the bounds of proba- 

^ bilit}^ ; so shall success attend th}' undertakings — 

thy heart shall not be vexed with disappointments. 



CALF'S HEAD STEWED, WITH OYSTER 
SAUCE. 

143. Soak half of a small calf's head 

(without the skin) for one hour in cold 

water, with a teacupful of vinegar in it. 

Well wash it in two or three waters ; put it 

into a stew-pan, with two onions, a bay leaf, 

a laurel leaf, a sprig of thyme, a sprig of 



THE YOUNG WIYE's COOK BOOK. 161 

marjoram, two sage leaves, four sprigs of 
parsley, two cloves, four allspice, six black 
peppercorns, half of a carrot, and a pint and 
a half of cold w^atcr. Boil up quickly ; 
skim ; then simmer gently for an hour and 
a half, skimming it constantly. Take out 
the head ; strain the liquor ; add to it three 
tablespoonsful of baked flour and the strained 
liquor of three dozen oysters ; boil up ; put 
the head in again, and continue longer ; 
add three dozen oysters, and then simmer 
for three-quarters of an hour and seven min- 
utes, and then serve. 

Intervals between Meals. — As a general rule, 
an interval of five or six hours should elapse be- 
tween each meal, but this of course varies according 
to circumstances. Persons encrao-ed in business fre- 
quently do themselves much mischief by disregard- 
ing these monitions amidst the bustle and excitement 
of business. It is no unusual thing for a merchant 
to breakfast at eight o'clock in the morning, ride 
several miles, and return to dine at six or seven 
o'clock in the evening, without having eaten any 
thing all day. This is ver}^ injurious, and although 
it may not be immediately felt, it lays the train for 
eubsequent dyspepsia and all its attendant horrors.

MOCK TURTLE, OF CALF'S HEAD. 

144. Take a fine large calf's head, split 
it open, and lay it for two or three hours in 
cold water ; then put it on to boil in as 
much water as will cover it. When it is 
done enough to take the meat off the bones, 
cut the meat into square pieces, and put 
them into a stewpan with some mace, cloves, 
nutmeg, red pepper, some sweet herbs, and 
a large onion ; salt it to your liking, put it 
in as much of the liquor as will cover it, and 
let it stew gently one hour. Then take one 
quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour, 
and some browned butter, mix it with the 
stew, and let it boil half an hour ; when 
done, add a glass of wine. Fry the liver 
and lay it round the dish with some nice 
forcemeat balls. 

Low Mantel-pieces. — Low mantel-pieces are 
much less wholesome than high ones, because the 
under line of the worst air in the room is on a level 
with the fire-place ; the lower, therefore, this top is 
placed in a room, the deeper the upper portion of 
the body is immersed in the inferior air. In rooms 
not well ventilated, the heads of the occupiers are

in the worst and the warmest air, their feet are 
placed in the best and coldest. A thermometer 
placed at different elevations in a warm room will 
confirm these truths. 



SWEET-BREAD FRIED. 

145. Cut sweet-breads into long slices, 
beat up the yolk of an egg, and rub it over 
them with a feather. Make a seasoning of 
pepper, salt, and grated bread; strew this 
over, and fry them in butter. Garnish with 
crisped parsley, and small thin slices of 
toasted bacon. 

A BROW-BEATING counscl askcd a witness, during 
a trial for assault, the distance he was from the 
parties when the assault happened. He answered, 
" Just four feet five inches and a half." " How 
come you to be so exact, fellow?" said the counsel. 
" Because I thought some fool or other would ask 
me, so I measured it." 



FRIED SWEET-BREADS. 

146. Parboil them in salt and water; 
when done, take them up and dry them in 



164 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

a cloth. With a sharp knife, cut them in 
half, season them with pepper and salt, flour 
them, and fry them in hot lard, of a light 
brown. Or they may be fried as oysters, 
with egg and bread crumbs, or grated 
crackers. 

Eat not to dulness ; drink not to elevation. 



BOILED SWEET-BREADS. 

147. First .parboil them, then throw 
them into cold water to whiten and harden 
them. Wipe them dry and season them 
with pepper and salt, and broil them. They 
should be basted while broiling by putting 
them on a plate with a little melted butter 
in it. 

A CALF when fed for market is said to have con- 
sumed as much milk as would make one hundred 
pounds of cheese. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 165 

TO FRICASSEE SWEET-BREADS. 

148. Parboil the sweet-breads in salt 
and water, and when cool skim them, but 
be careful not to break them. Season with 
salt and pepper, dust some flour over them, 
and fry them a fine brown. Put them on a 
dish ; make a gravy by adding some water 
to the fat they were fried in, and a little 
brown flour. As soon as the gravy is thick- 
ened, pour in some Lisbon or Maderia wine, 
take it off the fire, pour it over the sweet- 
breads and serve hot. 

The gifts of the understanding are the treasures 
of God ; and he appointeth to every one his portion 
in what measure seemeth good unto himself. 



ROASTED SWEET-BREADS. 

149. Sweet-breads should be parboiled, 
and then thrown into cold water, to make 
them white and firm. This is called hlanch' 
ing, and should precede all the other modes 



166 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of cooking them. Have ready some cracker 
crumbs well seasoned with pepper and salt, 
season your sweet-breads, dip each one into 
some beaten egg, then into the bread 
crumbs. Put them in a pan and bake or 
roast them. 

It is better to be laughed at than ruined ; better 
to have a wife who cheapens every thing and buys 
nothing, than to be impoverished by one whose 
vanity would purchase every thing, but whose pride 
will cheapen nothing. 



SWEETBREAD PIE. 

150. Season the sweetbreads with pep- 
per and salt, dust some flour over them, 
and add enough water to stew them with a 
nice gravy. When done, butter a pie dish, 
line it with paste, put in the sweetbreads 
and some of the gravy, cover the pie with 
a lid of paste, leaving an opening in the 
centre. Bake it in a tolerably hot oven. 
When the crust is brown, serve the pie

with the remainder of the gravy in a sauce 
tureen. 

Lord Byron knew a dull man -who lived on a 
bon mot of Moore's for a week ; and his lordship 
once offered a wager of a considerable sum that the 
reciter was guiltless of understanding its point, but 
he could get no one to accept the bet. 



STEWED SWEETBREADS. 

151. Parboil three or four sweetbreads 
in salt and water. When cool, skin them 
and cut them in half. Season them with 
pepper and salt, flour them, and fry them a 
light brown ; then stew them in a portion 
of the liquor in which they were boiled. 
Brown a piece of butter with flour ; add it, 
with a little pepper, salt, and a glass of 
white wine. 

A FORMAL, fashionable visitor thus addressed a 
little girl: — "How are you, my dear?" "Very 
well, 1 thank you," she replied. The visitor then 
added : " Xow, my dear, you should ask me how I 
am." The child simply and honestly replied, " I 
don't want to know 1" 



168 THE YOUNG TTIFe'S COOK BOOK. 

SWEETBREAD CUTLETS. 
152. Boil the sweetbreads for half an 
hour in water with a little salt, and when 
they are perfectly cold, cut them into slices 
of equal thickness, brush them with 3'olk 
of egg, and dip them into very fine bread 
crumbs seasoned with salt, Cayenne, and 
grated lemon-rind. Fry them of a fine 
light brown. Arrange them in a dish, 
placing them high in the centre, and pour 
under them a gravy made in the pan, 
thickened with .a little flour, to which a 
glass of sherry or Madeira may be added 
just before it is taken ofi* the fire. When 
it can be done conveniently, take as many 
slices of a cold boiled tongue as there are 
sweetbread cutlets, pare the skin from them, 
trim them into good shape, and dress them 
w^ith the sweetbreads after they have been 
egged and seasoned in the same way, and 
place each cutlet upon a slice of tongue 
when they are dished. For variety, sub- 
stitute fried bread cut the size of the cutlet.

CALVES' BRAINS FRIED. 

153. Wash the brains clean, parboil 
them, remove all the skin, and season with 
pepper and salt ; dust flour over them, 
or bread crumbs, and fry them a delicate 
brown. 

As the late Professor was one day walking 

near Aberdeen, he met a well-known individual of

season it with pepper and salt. Grease the 
bars of the gridiron, put the liver over a 
clear fire, and broil it till the slices are 
brown on both sides. 

A GENTLEMAN was One day disputing with Mirza 
Mohammed Ibrahim about the excellence of his cook, 
of whose fame he was veiy jealous, and wound up

he has been forty years before the fire." "Well," 
said the Mirza, " he may have been forty years before 
the fire, but he is raw yet P^ 



PIE OF COLD ROAST VEAL. 

155. Cut the veal in small pieces, and 
season them with pepper and salt. Make a 
nice paste, line a deep pie dish, fill it half 
full of the meat, and on the top lay some 
oysters, with some lumps of butter. Cover 
the pie with the paste and bake it. 

Lord Bragg, an ancestor of the Earl of Fife, was 
remarkable for practicing that miserable rule, " Get 
all you can, and keep all you get." One day, walking 
down the avenue from his house, he saw a farthing 
lying at his feet, which he took up and carefully 



THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 171 

cleaned. A beggar passing at the same time, en- 
treated his lordship would give him the farthing, 
saying "it was not worth a nobleman's attention." 
" Fin' a farthing yoursel', puir body," replied his 
lordship, and carefully put the coin into his breeches 
pocket. 



PIE OF COLD VEAL AND HAM. 
156. Cut the meat from the bones. 
It should be in pieces about half an inch 
square. Season it with pepper and salt. 
Take the bones and pieces of fat, put them 
in a saucepan with enough water to cover 
them. Let them stew till the water is 
reduced to one half Then remove the 
bones, thicken the gravy with some butter 
rolled in flour, and season it with pepper 
and salt to the taste. Line the bottom and 
sides of a pie dish with paste, put in a layer 
of veal, then a layer of cold ham sliced very 
thin — and so on, a layer of ham and veal 
alternately, till the dish is full. On the top 
of each layer, strew some yolks of eggs 
chopped fine. A few oysters or button- 



172 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

mushrooms improve this pie. Cover the 
top with paste, leaving an opening in the 
centre. Pour in a little of the gravy, and 
bake the pie in a rather slow oven. Serve 
it in the dish it was baked in, with the 
remainder of the gravy in a sauce tureen. 

Some men devote themselves so exclusively to 
their business as almost entirely to neglect their 
domestic and social relations. A gentleman of this 
class having failed, was asked what he intended to 
do. " I am going home to get acquainted with my 
wife and children P^ said he. 



TO COOK COLD SLICES OF VEAL. 

157. Take a piece of veal that has been 
roasted (but not over done), cut it into thin 
slices ; take from it the skin and gristles ; 
put some butter over the fire with some 
chopped onions ; fry them a little, then 
shake some flour over them ; shake the pan 
round, and put in some veal stock gravy, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and some spice ; put 
them in the veal with the yolk of two eggs;

POTATO SAUSAGE. 

158. Of cold veal, finely chopped, add 
the same quantity of cold mashed potatoes, 
and season with pepper and salt to the 
taste. Make it out in small cakes, flour 
them, and fry them a light brown. They 
may be fried in sausage gravy if you have 
any left. Cold potatoes left from dinner 
will answer for this dish 

" I AM sorry, Mr. Wilson, to see this field of pota- 
toes so diseased," said a sj-mpathizing inspector. 
"Ah ! weel, it's a great pity," replied the farmer,

159. To cold veal, finely chopped, add 
the same quantity of cold mashed potatoes ; 
season with pepper and salt to the taste ; 
make it out in small cakes ; flour them, and 
fry them a light brown on both sides. If 
there is any sausage gravy left, it is very 
good to fry them in. Cold potatoes left from 
dinner may be used for this dish. Cold 
beef may be used instead of veal. 



A NICE RAGOUT OF COLD VEAL. 

160. Cut the cold meat into small, 
round cutlets, trimming off the rough parts, 
bones, etc. "With the bones, trimmings, 
and an onion, make a little good gravy ; 
melt some butter in a frying pan, and flour

put in the veal with some of the cold gravy 
which has been left ; cover the top with the 
paste, leaving an opening in the centre, 
which may be ornamented by leaves of 
paste ; set it in a quick oven, and as soon 
as the crust is brown, serve the pie.

BROILED CHICKENS. 

162. Split them down the back, wash 
them nicely and wipe them dry. Heat 
your gridiron, grease the bars, and put your 
chickens over clear coals. Broil them 
nicely ; be careful not to burn the legs and 
wings. When done, season them with pep- 
per, salt, and a large piece of butter. Send 
them to the table hot. Partridges, pheas- 
ants and pigeons are broiled in the same way. 

There is no error more fatal than imagining that 
pinching a youth 'in his pocket mone^' will teach 
liim frugality. On the contrar}^ it will occasion 
his running into extravagances with so much more 
eagerness when he comes to have money in his own 
hands; as pinching him in his diet will make his 
appetite only the more rapacious. If you put into 
the hands of your child more money than is suita- 
ble to his age and discretion, you must expect to 
find that he has thrown it away upon what is not 
only idle, but hurtful. A certain, small, regular 
income any child above six 3^ears of age ought to 
have. When he comes to be capable of keeping an 
account, he ought to be obliged to do it ; he will 
thereb}^ acquire a habit of frugality, attention, and 
prudence, that will be of service to him through 
his whole life. On the contrary, to give a young 
person money to spend at will, without requiring 
any account of it, is leading, or rather forcing him, 
into extravagance and folly.

FRIED CHICKElfS. 

163. Wash your chickens, cut them in 
pieces, season them with pepper and salt. 
Have in a pan some hot butter and lard 
mixed ; dust some flour over each piece, and 
fry them slowly till of a bright brown on 
both sides ; take them up, put a little water 
in the pan, add some butter rolled in flour 
to thicken the gravy, and more pepper and 
salt if required. Young spring chickens are 
only suitable for frying. 

A COUNTRYMAN was once sowing his grass ground, 
"when two smart fellows, riding that wa}'', called to 
him with an insolent air, " Well, honest fellow,"

countryman replied : 'Tis very likely you may, 
truly, for I am sowing hemp."

son with salt and pepper. Line the sides 
of the pot with paste, put in the pieces of 
chicken, and between every layer of chicken 
put in a piece of butter rolled in flour, with 
squares of the paste if you choose ; pour in 
enough cold water to cover it, and put on a 
lid of the paste, leave an opening in the cen- 
tre of the top crust, cover the pot, place it 
in front of the fire w^ith a few coals under it. 
Turn the pot frequently that the crust may 
be evenly browned all around. When it is 
done, if the gravy should not be thick 
enough, add a little more flour mixed with 
butter. Dish it by putting the top crust on 
the sides of the dish, lay the chicken in the 
centre, and place the brown crust on the 
top. Serve the gravy in a sauce boat. 

Bacon says justly, the best part of beauty is that

165. Beat the yolk of two eggs. Cut 

the fowls into pieces and dip them first in 

the egg, then in the crumbs. Fry the cut 

pieces in butter or nice lard. Grated cheese 

may be used to give a piquant flavor. The

Parent : " Well, then, your mother may have one ; 
I'll take the other, and you shall have the third for 
your dinner. ^^ 



A DELICATE DISH FROM COLD FOWL OR VEAL. 

166. Stew a few small mushrooms in a 
bit of butter, a quarter of an hour; mince 
them very small, and add them, with the 
gravy, to minced veal or parts of fowl, with 
a little pepper and salt, some cream, and a 
bit of butter rubbed in a little flour. Sim-

mer three or four minutes, and serve on 
toasted bread. 

The best description of weakness we have ever 
heard is contained in the wag's prayer to his wife, 
when she gave him some thin chicken broth, that 
she would try to coax that chicken just to wade 
through that soup once more ! 



PATTIES FROM COLD TURKEY OR CHICKENS. 

167. Mince the white part of the flesh, 
and mix it with a little grated ham. Stew 
this in a little good gravy, or melted butter. 
Put a spoonful of cream to the mince, and 
season with pepper, salt and mace. Patties 
may be made of cold lamb, veal, turkey, 
chickens, etc., and of lobster, oysters, etc. 
Patties may be either baked in their paste, 
without the intervention of a pan, having a 
piece of paper under each ; or they may be 
baked in tin or earthenware pans of various 
forms. Those baked in pans will generally 
be most approved because the paste will be 
more delicate; or the paste will be baked

upon it. Puff paste should be employed. 

Good intentions are at least the seed of good ac- 
tions ; and ever}^ man ought to sow them, and leave 
it to the soil and the seasons whether the}^ come up 
or not, and whether he or any other gathers the 
fruit. 



FRICASSEE FROM COLD BOILED CHICKEN. 

168. Cut up the chicken and put it to 
simmer in a little gravy made of some of 
the water in which it was boiled, together 
with the neck, feet, liver, heart, and giz- 
zard, stewed well together. Season well 
with pepper and salt. Then take out the 
chicken, and keep it hot. Strain the gravy, 
put it back in the saucepan, with a little 
more salt and pepper if necessary, a little 
grated nutmeg, and a bit of butter rolled in 
flour. Give it a boil, then add a little 
cream, and stir it over the fire, but do not 
let it boil again. Pour this gravy over the 
chicken, and serve hot. Some nicely fried

"I REGARD the discovery of a new dish," said a 
gourmand, "as a far more interesting event than the 
discovery of a new star — for we always have stars 
enough, but can never have too many cooks. I 
shall never consider the science sufficiently honored 
until we have a cook elected to Congress." 



BROILED COLD CHICKEN. 

169. Split the chicken down the back, 
have an egg beaten, dip the chicken into it, 
and then into some nicely-seasoned bread 
crumbs. Broil over a clear gentle fire. 
The neck, feet, and gizzard, may be boiled 
down to make a gravy; and the liver, after 
having simmered five or ten minutes, may 
be taken out, mashed, and used to thicken 
the gravy. Serve hot.

VEHY NICE SCALLOPS FROM COLD CHICKEN. 

170. Bone the meat, and mince it 
small ; set it over the fire in a little cream, 
and season with nutmeg, pepper, and salt ; 
then put it into scallop shells, and fill with 
crumbs of bread, over which put some bits 
of butter, and brown them.

trimmings and bones in a saucepan with 
some pepper, salt, a slice of lean ham, and 
a little onion. Simmer this for half an 
hour, thicken it with a bit of butter rolled

172. Mince the meat, and add suitable 

proportions of suet, grated bread, ham, and 

a little parsley. Mix these with pepper,

A POOR emaciated Irishman, having called in a 
doctor as a forlorn hope, the latter spread a huge 
mustard plaster and clapped it on the poor fellow's 
breast. Pat, with a tearful eye looking downward 
upon it, said: — " Docthor, docthor ! it strikes me 
that's a dale of mustard /o?' so little mate P^ 



RAGOUT OF LIVERS OF POULTRY, GAME, Etc. 

173. Soak the livers in water and clean 
them, put them into a saucepan with gravy, 
pickled mushrooms, or a little catsup, and 
a bit of butter rolled in flour. Season with 



THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 185 

pepper and salt. Stew for ten or twelve 
minutes. The liver of a turkey may be 
broiled and set in the centre of the dish, 
with the other livers around. 

Sidney Smith was once dining with a French 
gentleman, who had been before dinner indulging 
in a variety of free-thinking speculations, and had 
ended b}^ avowing himself a materialist. "Yery 
good soup this," said Mr. Smith. '' Oui, Monsieur, 
&est excellente^-^ was the reply. " Pray, sir, do you 
believe in a cook ?" inquired Mr. Smith. 



TO ROAST A TURKEY WITH OYSTERS. 

174-. When it is trussed for roasting, 
cut the liver to pieces and set it over the 
fire in a stew-pan, with half a pint of 
oysters washed, and their liquor, which 
must be strained, some pepper and salt, 
two bay leaves, two blades of mace, a piece 
of butter rolled in flour. Let these stew 
very gently about ten minutes, and then 
take them off. Singe the turkey and stuff 
it with oysters, cover the paper over it, spit

it, and lay it down to a good fire, but at a 
distance. While it is roasting set on a 
stew-pan with half a pint of essence of 
ham; take a pint of oysters, throw them 
into boiling water; take off the beards, 
then put them into the essence of ham; 
add a little lemon juice, give them a boil. 
When the turkey is done and in the dish, 
pour the sauce over it. 

To BE continually judging and censuring those 
that were never privately and personally reproved, 
lovingly and compassionately admonished, nor once 
earnestly and heartily prayed for by them — this 
censorious spirit is a Christless spirit. 



TURKEY HASHED. 
175. Mix some flour with a piece of 
butter, stir it into some cream and a little 
veal gravy till it boils up. Cut the turkey 
in pieces, not too small, put it into the 
sauce, with grated lemon peel, white pepper, 
and mace (pounded) ; a little mushroom 
powder or catsup. Simmer it up. Oysters 
may be added.

Fowls seem exceedingly grateful for the gift 
of cold water. They never swallow a drop of it 
without turning up their eyes to heaven. 



ROAST DUCK. 

176. Clean and prepare them as other 
poultry. Crumb the inside of a small loaf 
of baker s bread, to which add three ounces 
of butter, one large onion chopped fine, 
with pepper and salt to taste. Mix all 
well together. Season the ducks both in- 
side and out with pepper and salt. Then 
fill them with the dressing, and skewer 
tightly. Place them on the pan, back 
upward ; dredge a little flour over, with 
water sufficient to make gravy. When a 
nice brown, turn them over. Baste fre- 
quently ; and when done, send to the table 
hot, and eat with cranberry sauce. 

Dr. Franklin was once endeavoring to kill a 
turkey by electricit}^ when he received the whole 
force of the battery himself Recovering, he good- 
humoredly remarked, that instead of a turkey, he 
had nearly put an end to a goose. 



188 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

177. Clean your goose, wash it, and 
wipe it dry, then season it with pepper and 
salt, both inside and out. Make a dressing 
of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, butter, a lit- 
tle sweet marjoram and some onions finely 
minced. Fill the goose with this dressing, 
truss it firmly, and put it on the spit. 
"Whilst it is roasting, baste it with butter, 
and be careful not to let it burn. Clean the 
giblets, put them on in a stew-pan, with very 
little water, some salt and pepper, and boil 
them. Add the liquor they were boiled in 
to the gravy which dripped from the goose. 
Thicken it with some butter rolled in flour, 
let it boil a few minutes ; add more pepper 
and salt, if necessary. Pour this gravy in 
the boat, and serve it with the goose. Some 
prefer a little sage added to the dressing in 
place of the sweet marjoram. A very good 
dressing for roast goose is to substitute pota- 
toes boiled and finely mashed instead of the 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 189 

bread crumbs, then add the pepper, salt, 
onions and sweet marjoram as before. 

An awkward man attempting to carve a goose, 
dropped it on the floor. " There now I" exdaimed 
the wife, "we've lost our dinner." "Oh no, my 
dear I" answered he, " it's safe. I have got my foot 
on itP^ 



COLD DUCKS STEWED WITH RED CABBAGE. 

178. Cut cold ducks into convenient 
pieces, and warm them very gradually in 
some of their gravy. Shred some red cab- 
bage very fine, wash it, and drain it on a 
sieve ; put it to stew with some butter, and 
a little pepper and salt, in a stew-pan closely 
covered, shaking it frequently. If it should 
get too dry, add a spoonful or two of the 
gravy. When well done and tender, add a 
small glass of wine or vinegar; lay it on a 
dish ; place the pieces of duck upon it, and 
serve. 

A Man whose fin^t wife tvas remarkably neat 
married a slattern. On one occasion she mustered 
resolution to rub down the old mahogany table. 



190 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

Her good man sat quietly regardiDg her niitil she 
had done, when he burst into tears. She desired 
to know what had affected him in so unusual a 
manner ? '' The sight of that table," said he ; " for 
I now recognize it as an old acquaintance, and it 
awakens reminiscences of days that are gone, for it 
always looked thus when my first w^ife was living." 
It is unneccessar}^ to say that the insulted lady 
bounced out of the room and declared as she 
slammed the door behind her, that she would make 
herself a slave to no man.

COLD DUCK STEWED WITH PEAS. 

179. Put a pint of the cold duck gravy 
and a pint of green peas together in a stew- 
pan, and let them stew until the peas are 
soft ; then add a glass of red wine, or this 
may be omitted. Add some onion chopped 
small, or garlic, if liked, and a little more 
gravy, to make up the loss by stewing. 
Season with lemon peel, Cayenne pepper 
and salt. Put in the duck, and warm 
gently, under a close cover. Add a little 
walnut catsup, and serve hot. 

Dr. Marsh says, the best cure for the hysterics 
is to discharge the servant girl. In his opinion 



THE YOUNG T^IFE'S COOK BOOK. 191 

there is nothing like work to keep the nervous sys- 
tem from becoming unstrung. Some women think 
they want a physician, when they need a scrubbing- 
brush. 



HASHED COLD DUCK. 



180. Cut the duck in pieces, season 
with pepper and salt. Slice some cold ham 
very thin. Lay the duck and ham in a 
stew-pan, put some pieces of butter rolled in 
flour, with enough water to keep it from 
burning. As soon as it comes to the boil 
add a glass of Madeira wine, and serve it 
with green peas boiled and buttered. The 
hash should not boil after the wine is poured 
in, but be taken off the fire immediately. 



GIBLET PIE. 

181. Clean the giblets, cut the legs in 
two, the wings and neck into three, and th^ 
gizzard into four pieces, season them highly 
with pepper and salt, pour a little water on

them and stew them till tender. Then 
take out the giblets, and when they are cool 
put them in a deep dish with a little of the 
liquor they were stewed in, cover with paste, 
and bake in a moderate oven. In the mean 
time take the remainder of the liquor, skim 
it free from fat, put it over the fire in a 
clean stew-pan, with more seasoning, if 
necessary, and thicken it with a little flour 
and butter. Serve this gravy in a sauce 
tureen with the pie. If you have any cold 
game or poultry it might be cut in pieces 
and included in the pie ; but the bones 
should be cracked and stewed with the 
giblets. 

A TRAVELLER was lately boasting of the luxury 
of arriving at night after a hard day's journey, to 
partake of the enjoyment of a well-cut ham, and the

luxury of a left leg ?" " Sir, to conceive its luxury, 
you must find that it is the only leg that is leftV

GIBLET PIE-ANOTHER WAY. 

182. Take the tips of the wings, heart, 
liver, head, neck and gizzard of a goose, 
clean them well, boil them in enough salt 
and water to cover them. Take them out 
when tender, and to the water they were 
boiled in, add pepper and more salt if re- 
<;iuired, and a little flour, and as soon as it 
boils remove it from the fire. Make a good 
paste ; cover the bottom and sides of a pie 
dish, put in the giblets, pour some of the 
gravy over them, cover the top with paste, 
leaving an opening in the centre to permit 
the escape of the steam, and bake it in a 
quick oven. Have the remainder of the 
gravy hot and serve in a tureen with the 
pie.

salt, and a little butter rolled in flour, cover 
them with water, stew them till they are 
very tender. Line the sides of your pie 
dish with paste, put in the giblets, and if 
the gravy is not quite thick enough, add a 
little more butter rolled in flour. Let it boil 
once, pour in the gravy, put on the top 
crust, leaving an opening in the centre of it 
m the form of a square ; ornament this with 
leaves of the paste. Set the pie in the oven,

A GREEN one, who had a great desire to possess a 
goose alive, set off to a neighboring town, resolved 
to buy one, and fatten it for himself Having made 
a bargain, he was returning home when he was met 
by a waggish friend, to whom he showed his pur- 
chase. " Why," said his friend to him, on seeing 
the goose. " They've given you no giblets with him ; 
you have been cheated." The smiling countenance 
of the Irishman was turned to dismay ; he reflected 
for a moment, then turned back, and actuallj- walked 
a distance of two miles, to ask the market woman 
for the giblets of the live goose.

BROILED PIGEONS. 

184. Young pigeons or squabs are the 
nicest for broiling. Cut them down the 
back, clean them nicely, wash them and dry 
them on a clean napkin. Have ready a bed 
of clear coals, heat your gridiron, grease the 
bars to prevent the pigeons from sticking, 
and place them over the fire; turn them 
frequently, and be careful not to let the legs 
and wings burn. When they are done, put 
them on a dish, season them with pepper 
and salt, and baste them well with butter 
on both sides. 

One and two are three. — A young student 
came during the holidays from college to see his 
parents. Having one evening two pigeons for sup- 
per, he said to them, " I can prove by the rules of 
logic and arithmetic that those two pigeons are 
three." " Do so, my dear," said the father. There- 
upon he began. " This is one, and that is two, and 
one and two make three." The father replied, " As 
you have done it so nicely, your mother shall have 
the first pigeon, I will keep the second, and you may 
take the third."

One would never guess the device adopted by 
one of the London dandies of ripe age to delude his 
acquaintances into the supposition that his luxuri- 
ant wig is the natural product of his own head. 
The secret has been betra3^ed by a treacherous bar- 
ber. The gentleman, it seems, caused to be manu- 
factured as many wigs as there are days in the 
month, each wig being provided with a box and a 
number. Every morning he puts on a peruke 
slighll}^ differing from the others. Thus, the hair 
of number four is a trifle longer than that of num- 
ber three, and so on to numbers thirty and thirty- 
one, which look as though they needed cutting. 
Upon reaching the last day of the month, our in- 
genious beau visits his club, runs his fingers through 
his wig, and says in a careless tone, "My hair is 
growing much too long ; I must have it cut I" And 
the next morning he dons number one again.

pepper over them, and baste well with 
butter. They may also be roasted like 
chickens.

pie is done put the top or soft crust at the 
bottom of the dish, lay the rabbit on it, then 
place the brown crust on the top with the 
brown side up. Serve the gravy in a gravy

A MISER caught a fly, put it into the sugar basin, 
and set a plate over it. "What is that for?" said 
a bystander. "Hush!" whispered the miser, "if 
the fly escapes, I shall know that some one has been

BEST WAY OF COOKING VENISON. 

195. Cut your venison in rather thin 
slices, pound them, lay them on a dish, and 
send them to the table. Have a chafing-dish 
on the table, lay some of the slices of venison 
in the pan of the chafing-dish, throw on a 
little salt, but not so much as for other meat, 
a lump of butter, and some currant jelly, 
put the cover on the dish, let it remain a 
minute or two, take off the cover, turn the 
slices of meat, place it on again, and in two 
or three minutes more the venison will be 
sufficiently cooked. Each person at the 



THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 207 

table adds pepper to suit the taste. Some 
prefer venison cooked without currant jelly. 

Resolve to perform what you ought: perform 
without fail what you resolve. 



VENISON STEAKS. 

196. Cut your venison in slices, pound 
it, and having heated your gridiron, grease 
the bars and place the meat on it. Broil 
tlie venison very quickly over clear coals, 
and as soon as it is done put it on a dish, 
season with pepper and salt and plenty of 
butter. Send it to the table immediately. 
Serve it with currant jelly. The plates 
should be warm. 

There is no objection to broils in a house, so they 
be confined to the kitchen. 



HASH OF COLD VENISON. 

197. Cut the meat from the bones; 
crack the bones and put them into a sauce- 



208 THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

pan with the trimmings, with barely enough 
water to cover them ; stew till the water is 
reduced one half; strain the liquid, and add 
some pieces of butter rolled in flour, and 
some currant jelly. As soon as it boils add 
the venison, which should be cut in small 
pieces. In five minutes it will be ready to 
serve. 

Even a pig upon a spit has one consolation ; 
things are sure to take a turn. 

When Dr. Johnson was asked why he was not 
invited out to dine as Garrick was, he answei'ed, as 
if it was a triumph to him, " Because great lords 
and ladies don't like to have their mouths stopped I" 



A HASH OF COLD VENISON. 

198. Cut the cold venison into thin 
slices. Then make a gravy by stewing the 
bones and trimmings, which should be sea- 
soned with some whole grains of pepper and 
salt ; thicken it with a piece of butter rolled 
in flour. When hot add a glass of port wine 



THE YOUXG wife's COOK BOOK. 209 

and a small glass of currant jelly ; then put 
in the slices of venison and simmer them 
slowly for a few minutes. Serve with 
toasted bread around the dish. 

At a venison feast Sir Joshua Reynolds addressed 
his conversation to one of the company who sat 
near him, but to his great surprise, could not get a 
single word in answer; until, at length, his silent 
neighbor turned to him and said, " Sir Joshua, 
whenever you ai-e at a venison feast, I advise you 
not to speak during dinner-time. Through that 
last question of j^ours, I have unfortunately swal- 
lowed a fdece of fine fat, without tasting the flavor /" 



A NICE PIE FROM COLD VENISON. 

199. Cut the venison into small squares 
and season it with grated numeg, pepper, 
and salt ; line the sides and edges of a dish 
with puff paste, lay in the meat, and add 
half a pint of rich gravy, made with the 
trimmings of the venison ; add a glass of 
port wine, and the juice of half a lemon ; 
cover the dish with the paste and bake. 
Pour a little more gravy into the pie when

it comes from the oven. Good either hot or 
cold. 

An old gentleman being asked what he liked for 
dinner replied : " A keen appetite, good company ^ 
something to eat, and a clean napkin.'^ 



.^ A NICE STEW FROM COLD VENISON. 

200. Make a gravy from the fragments 
and bones, and add, if convenient, a little 
mutton gravy. Let this simmer ; then skim 
and add browned butter thickened with 
flour, some catchup, a little claret, if ap- 
proved, and a spoonful of currant jelly. 
Squeeze in a little lemon ; give a boil, and 
then while simmering add the pieces of veni- 
son thinly sliced. Garnish with cut pickles ; 
or with slices of lemon, and fried bread. 

Old Mrs. Darnley is a pattern of household 
economy. She says she has made a pair of socks 
last fifteen years, by merely knitting new feet to

ROAST PIG. 
201. Prepare the pig by cutting off the 
feet, scraping and cleansing the head and 
ears, cutting out the tongue and eyes, and 
cleaning the throat. Wash it perfectly 
clean, and wipe it dry. Make a dressing 
of bread crumbs, some onions finely chop- 
ped, with salt, pepper, and sweet marjoram, 
to the taste; also butter enough to make 
the crumbs adhere together. Any spice 
may be added, and the grating of a lemon, 
but many prefer the dressing without spice. 
Rub the pig thoroughly inside with salt, 
Cayenne pepper, and powdered sage; then 
fill it with the dressing and sew it up. Rub 
the outside with salt, Cayenne pepper, and 
sage, put it on the spit, and place it before 
a clear but not too hot a fire. Have a piece 
of clean sponge tied on a stick, dip it in 
melted butter, and as the skin dries moisten 
it. A common-sized pig takes from three 
to four hours to roast. An excellent filling 
may be made of potatoes boiled and mashed, 



212 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

instead of the bread. If potatoes are used, 
the dressing will require more butter. 

It is said by those who know, that Lamb on 
Koast Pig is relished by every one. 



ROAST PORK. 

202. Take a nice middle piece of 
young pork, separate the joints, and crack 
the bones across the middle, but do not 
break the skin ; score it parallel with the 
ribs, wash it, put it on the spit, with a little 
water in the bottom of the roaster ; and to 
five pounds of pork rub in well two tea- 
spoonfuls and a half of salt, two teaspoon- 
fuls of sugar, and one of Cayenne pepper. 
Put no flour on it, or baste it while cooking, 
as it softens the skin and makes it tough. 
Pour the gravy into a pan, skim off a part 
of the fat, stir in a little flour mixed with 
cold water, add some water, and let it boil 
once — then serve it in a gravy tureen. If 



THE YOUNG TTIFe's COOK BOOK. 213 

it should not be sufficiently seasoned, add a 
little more pepper or salt as it may require. 
Apple sauce is always served with roast 
pork. 

"What is Eternity?" — The following beautiful 
answer, by a pupil of the deaf-and-dumb school at 
Paris, contains a sublimity of conception scarcely 
to be equalled: " The lifetime of the Almighty." 



PORK STEAKS. 

203. Cut the pork into slices, season 
with Cayenne pepper, salt, and pulverized 
sage. Fry them a fine brown on both sides. 
Place a form of cranberry sauce in the 
centre of the dish, and lay the slices of 
pork around it. Apple sauce may be 
preferred to the cranberry — in which case 
it must be piled up in the centre of' the 
dish.

SCRAPPLE, No. 1. 
204. This is generally made of the 
head, feet, and any pieces which may be 
left after having made sausage meat. 
Scrape and wash well all the pieces de- 
signed for the scrapple, and put them in a 
pot with just as much water as will cover 
them. Add a little salt, and let them boil 
slowly till the flesh is perfectly soft and the 
bones loose. Take all the meat out of the 
pot, pick out the bones, cut it up fine, and 
return it to the liquor in the pot. Season 
it with pepper, salt, and rubbed sage, to 
the taste. Set the pot over the fire, and 
just before it begins to boil, stir in gradually 
as much Indian meal as will make it as 
thick as thick mush. Let it boil a few 
minutes, take it ofi", and pour it in pans. 
When cold, cut it in slices, flour it, and fry 
it in hot lard or sausage fat. Some prefer 
buckwheat meal — this is added in the same 
manner as the Indian. Indian meal is 
preferable, as it is not so solid as buck- 



THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 215 

wheat. Sweet marjoram may be added 
with the sage if preferred. 

By the use of eye-glasses, you may see as much 
as is to be seen ; but by the use of another kind of 
glass you may see twice as much. 



SCRAPPLE, No. 2. 

205. Take the head, feet, and ears of 
a pig, and after thoroughly cleansing them, 
put them into salt and water, and boil them 
several hours, until the bones leave the 
flesh ; strain ofl" the liquor they were boiled 
in, pick out all the bones very carefully, 
and with a large wooden spoon mash up 
the meat. Then pour the liquor over the 
meat, set it over the fire, and as soon as it 
begins to boil add as much Indian meal or 
buckwheat flour as will make it very thick. 
Stir it continually while it is boiling, which 
will require ten or fifteen minutes. In the 
mean time season it highly with Cayenne 
pepper, salt, and pulverized sage. Turn it 



216 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

out in pans to cool. When cold, cut it in 
slices, and fry them a nice brown on both 
sides. Buckwheat meal and Indian meal 
may be mixed in equal proportions if 
preferred. 

A NOBLE Lord asked a Clergyman once, at the 
bottom of his table, why the goose was always

MINCED PORK CUTLETS. 

206. Mince three quarters of a pound 
of lean roast pork and two shalots. Season 
with a saltspoonful of salt, half a saltspoon- 
ful of pepper, a mustardspoonful of fresh- 
made mustard, half a grain of Cayenne, a 
quarter of a saltspoonful of sage in fine 
powder, and a teaspoonful of baked flour; 
add a tablespoonful of pork gravy, and one 
well-beaten egg. Make up the meat into 
the form of small cutlets (five or six) of 



TITE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 217 

equal size, dredge them with baked flour, 
and fry (in plenty of boiling fat) till of a 
pale brown color (about eight minutes). 
Serve with apple sauce, made as follows : 
Peel and cut up four large apples; put 
them into a saucepan with two tablespoon- 
fuls of moist sugar, and two tablepoonfuls 
of brandy; simmer for three quarters of an 
hour ; beat with a wooden spoon till quite 
smooth. Place the cutlets round the dish, 
and the sauce in the centre. 



If it be diflScult to rule thine anger, it is wise to 
prevent it. Avoid, therefove, all occasions of falling 
into wrath, or guard thyself against them whenever 
they occur. 



SAUSAGE MEAT. 



207. Twenty-five pounds of pork, half 
a pint of salt, one gill of rubbed sage, half 
a gill of black pepper, one tablespoonful of 
Cayenne pepper. 



218 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

It is considered very creditable to men to have 
hearts of oak, but not half so creditable to have 
wooden heads. 



PIGS' FEET. 

208. Pigs' feet should be scraped and 
thoroughly cleaned, and boiled in water 
with a proper quantity of salt. When 
thoroughly tender, cut them in half, put 
them in a pan with some lard, and fry 
them a nice brown. If approved, some 
vinegar may be added to the gravy. They 
may be eaten hot or cold. 



SOUSED FEET. 

209. Take four or eight pigs' feet, and 
after thoroughly scraping and cleaning them, 
put them on to boil in some salt and water. 
They should cook very slowly until the 
meat is perfectly tender. Take out the 
large bones, cut each foot in four pieces. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 219 

season with Cayenne pepper and salt. When 
cold, pour cold vinegar over them. If pre- 
ferred, some grains of allspice and a sprig or 
two of mace may be added. 



HOG'S-HEAD CHEESE. 

210. Clean a pig's head nicely, wash it 
well, and boil it in very little water, with 
some salt. Let it boil until the bones fall 
from the flesh. Then take it up, take out 
all the bones and with a wooden spoon 
mash it up well, and return it to the water 
it was boiled in. Add red and black pepper, 
rubbed sage and sweet marjoram to the taste. 
Boil the whole down till it is quite thick 
and nearly dry; then pour it in pans or 
forms, smooth it over the top with the back 
of the spoon, and stand it away to get cold. 
Cut it in slices and send it to the table. 
Some prefer spice in hog's-head cheese ; in 
that case, add a small quantity of ground 
cloves and mace.

Dr. Franklin, when in England, used pleasantly 
to repeat an observation of his negro servant, when 
the Doctor was making the tour of Derbyshire, Lan-

HOW TO COOK A HAM. 

211. Never put a ham in cold water, 
and be equally careful never to place one in 
boiling water. First, let the water become 
lukewarm, and then put the ham in. Let 
it simmer or boil lightly for four or five 
hours — ^ye is better than four — then take 
it out and shave the rind off. Rub granu- 
lated sage into the whole surface of the ham 
so long as it can be made to receive it. 
Place the ham in a baking dish, with a 
bottle of champagne or prime cider. Baste 
occasionally with juice, and let it baste an 
hour in a gentle heat. 



THE YOUXG -U^IFE'S COOK BOOK. 221 

You that are rich have of all people the least 
cause to be idle ; God gives you more than others ; 
and is there any reason then that you should do less 
for God than others, and make your whole lives a 
long vacation ?" 



BOILED HAM. 

212. Wash and scrape your ham ; if it 
is not very salt it need not be soaked ; if old 
and dry, let it soak twelve hours in luke- 
warm water, which should be changed 
several times. Put it in a large vessel filled 
with cold w^ater. Let it simmer, but be 
careful not to let it boil, as it hardens and 
toughens the meat. Allow twenty minutes 
to cook each pound of meat. When it is 
done, take it out of the water, strip off the 
skin, and serve it. Twist scalloped letter 
paper round the shank, or ornament it with 
sprigs of green parsley neatly twisted round 
it. If it is not to be eaten whilst hot, as soon 
as it is taken from the pot, set it away to get 
cold, then skin it, by which means you pre- 



222 THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

serve all the juice of the meat. It may be 
garnished as above, or, if you choose, you 
may glaze it. 



GLAZED HAM. 

213. Beat the yolks of two eggs very 
light, cover your ham all over with the 
beaten egg, then sift over some grated 
cracker, and then set the ham in the oven 
to brown the glazing. 

As lately a sage on a fine ham was repasting

He exclaimed to a friend, who sat silent and fasting, 

''What a breakfast of learning is mine !" 
"A breakfast of learning !" with wonder he cried, 

And laugh'd, for he thought him mistaken ; 
" Why, what is it else ?" the sage quickly replied,

that was in any way wrong .'" 



A VERY NICE ENTREE FROM COLD 
ROAST PIG. 

215. Remove the flesh from the bones, 
and also the skin, and cut into convenient 
pieces. Melt a bit of butter, the size of an 
egg, and throw in six or eight button 
mushrooms cleaned and sliced. Shake 
them over the fire for three or four minutes, 
then stir to them a dessertspoonful of flour, 



224 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

and continue to shake or toss them gently, 
but do not allow them to burn. Add a 
small bunch of parsley, a middling-sized 
blade of mace, some salt, a small quantity 
of Cayenne pepper, and half a pint of 
water. Let these boil gently until reduced 
nearly one third ; take out the parsley and 
mace, lay in the meat, and add two or three 
glasses of wine, and bring it slowly to the 
point of simmering. Stir to it the beaten 
yolks of three fresh eggs, and the strained 
juice of half a lemon. Serve hot. 

Whenever our neighbor's house is on fire, it

BREAKPAST DISH FROM COLD BACON. 

216. Cut the bacon into slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick, grate over them 
some crust of bread, and powder them well 
with it on both sides. Lay the rashers on

a cheese-toaster, and brown them on both 
sides. 

Excellent to accompany poached or fried 
eggs, and for a garnish around veal cutlets,

them out — drain the cabbage — wipe a sauce- 
pan, or the pot they were boiled in, put the 
potatoes and cabbage into it, mash both very 
fine, add the butter and cream with salt and 
pepper to the taste. Set the pot over the 
fire and stir it till the potatoes are hot. 
Serve it immediately. This is very good 
with cold meat. 

A NOVEL WAY TO CLEAN A WATCH. — " I Caiinot 

conceive, my dear, what's the matter with my watch : 
I think it must want cleaning," exclaimed an indul- 
gent husband to his better half, the other day. 
" No, pa," said his petted daughter, " I know it 
don't want cleaning, because baby and I washed it 
in the basin ever so long this morning." 



POTATO LOAVES. 

222. Potato loaves are very nice 
when eaten with roast beef or mutton, 
and are made of any portion of the mashed 
roots, prepared without milk, by mixing 
with them a good quantity of very finely 
minced raw shallot, powdered with pepper 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 229 

and salt; then beating up the whole with 
a lump of butter to bind it, and dividing 
it into small loaves of a conical form, and 
placing them under the meat to brown, that 
is, when it is so nearly done as to impart 
some of the gravy along with the fat. 

Op much speaking cometh repentance, but in 
silence is safety. 



BOILED POTATOES. 

223. Prepare your potatoes, and let 
them stand in cold water, in an earthen pot, 
for three hours. Have ready a pot full of 
boiling water, with some salt in it, and drop 
in the potatoes half an hour before dinner 
is served. Have ready a colander, well 
warmed, throw the potatoes in it, shake 
them well, and put them in a vegetable dish, 
well warmed. 

Sir Thomas Overbury says that the man who 
has not any thing to boast of but his illustrious an- 
cestors, is like a potato — the only good belonging 
to him is under ground.

FEIED POTATOES. 

224. Pare the potatoes and cut them 
into four quarters, and divide each quarter 
into two ; let them stand in cold water ten 
minutes ; drain, and wipe them quite dry ; 
throw them into a stew-pan half filled with 
boiling fat, and fry to a pale brown color. 
Take them out with a slice, and place them 
on a sheet of white blotting paper on a sieve, 
so as to absorb the fat before serving.

225. Six potatoes, six onions, two 
ounces of butter, pepper, salt and vinegar 
to the taste. Boil the potatoes and the 
onions till they are soft; the onions require 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 231 

about as long again as the potatoes. Wipe 
out the pot in which the potatoes were 
boiled, mash the onions in it, slice the pota- 
toes, but do not mash them, and add to the 
onions, put in the butter, pepper, salt and 
vinegar ; set it over the fire and stir it till 
it is hot, when it will be ready for the table. 
Some persons prefer it without the vinegar. 

" Sire, one word," said a soldier one day to 
Frederick the Great, when presenting to him a re-

whistled, and signed. 



POTATOES A-LA-MAITRE D'HOTEL. 

226. Boil and peel the potatoes; let 
them grow nearly cold ; then cut them into 
slices tolerably thick, and warm them up in 
white sauce or melted butter, with parsley 
chopjDed; put into it a little w^hite pepper 
and salt, and the juice of half a lemon. Or 
boil the potatoes, and let them become cold. 



232 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

then cut them into rather thick slices. Put 
a lump of fresh butter into a stew-pan, add 
a little flour, about a teaspoonful for a 
moderate dish ; when the flour has boiled a 
short time in the butter, add a cupful of 
water and a little cream ; beat all together, 
then put in the potatoes covered with 
chopped parsley, pepper, and salt ; stew 
them for a few minutes, and then take them 
from the fire ; add a little lemon-juice, and 
send to table. 

One tear of a woman is oftentimes more formida-

COLD POTATOES WITH SPINACH OR CABBAGE. 

227. Mash cold potatoes, and moisten 
them with a little white sauce ; take cold 
cabbage or spinach, and chop very finely ; 
moisten them with brown gravy. Fill 
a tin mould with layers of potatoes and 
cabbage, cover the top, and put it into a 



THE YOUNG WIYE'S COOK BOOK. 233 

stew-pan of boiling water. Let it remain 
long enough to make the vegetables hot ; 
then turn them out and serve. This forms 
a very pretty dish for an entrie. Cold 
carrots and turnips may be added to soups ; 
or may be warmed up separately, and put 
into moulds and layers, and served the 
same as the potatoes and cabbage described 
above. 

" I LOVE you like any thing," said a young

TO IMPROVE POTATOES OF BAD aiTALITY. 

228. Potatoes are sometimes of very 
inferior quality, being deficient in starch. 
The method to improve them by cooking 



234 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

is, to peel tnem, and boil them gently, until 
nearly done. Then drain the water from 
them, and put them again upon the fire to 
make them hot without burning them ; then 
mash them with a fork. The fork breaks 
them into pieces and allows the water to 
escape, thus very much improving the pota- 
toes. 



OLD POTATOES TO LOOK LIKE YOTJNG ONES. 

229. Wash some large potatoes, and 
with a small scoop made for the purpose, 
form as many diminutive ones as will fill 
a dish ; boil them in two or three waters 
about three minutes each time, the water 
being put to them cold ; then let them steam 
till tender ; pour a white sauce over them, 
and serve with the second course. Old pota-

Hood states that the phrase " republic of letters" 
was hit upon to insinuate that, taking the whole 
lot of authors together, they had not a sovereign 
amongst them. 



SPINACH, No. 1. 



230. Wash it well througli several 
waters, as it is apt to be gritty. Put it 
into a vegetable dish, and strew over the 
top, eggs which have been boiled hard and 
finely chopped, or poached eggs. 



SPINACH, No. 2. 

231. Pick off the stem of each leaf, and 
avoid using any that are old or discolored ; 
wash the spinach in several waters, and put 
it into a quart of boiling water wilh a des- 
sertspoonful of salt ; press it down, and let 
it boil rapidly (uncovered) for ten or twelve 
minutes ; drain it through a sieve, and press

out all the water ; mince quite fine, and put 

it into a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, 

a saltspoonful of salt, half the quantity of 

white pepper, and a teaspoonful of sifted 

sugar. Stir for six or eight minutes. Place 

the spinach on a vegetable dish, smooth it 

over with a knife, and cut it into triangles. 

Garnish with fried sippets. Cut a slice of 

bread into small three-cornered pieces, and 

fry to a pale brown color in plenty of butter 

or oil. 

The leading duties of life are — 1. To worship 
God. 2. To acquire wisdom. 3. To maintain 
health. 4. To cherish love. 5. To gain wealth. 
6. To do o^ood. 



BAKED TOMATOES. 

232. Put some tomatoes into a pan, 
with a small lump of butter on each. Put 
them in the oven, and bake them till the 
skin shrivels. Serve them hot. Each 
persoii at the table dresses them on his 
own plate.

TOMATO FRICAXDEATT. 

233. Get some slices of veal cutlets, 
pound and wash them, season them with 
pepper and salt, and fry them slowly till 
they are done. They should be of a light 
brown on both sides. Stew some tomatoes 
very dry, strain them through a sieve to 
get out all the seeds, pour the pulp into the 
gravy after the meat has been taken out, 
and thicken it with a piece of butter rolled 
in flour. Pour this over the meat and serve 
it hot. 

" The Pythagoreans had a wise sajdng, * That a 
special care is to be had of two portions of our 
time — of the morning, to consider, and to resolve 
to do what ought to be done ; and of the evening, 
to examine whether we have done what we ouo:ht.' " 



TOMATO MUSTARD. 



234. Cut a peck of tomatoes in small 
pieces, and boil them till tender. Kub 
them through a sieve to extract the pulp,

which put on and boil until nearly dry. 
Then add one tablespoonful of Cayenne 
pepper, one tablespoonful of black pepper, 
one teaspoonful of cloves, two tablespoonfuls 
of mustard seed, and two tablespoonfuls of 
salt. Boil the whole a few moments, and 
when cold bottle it and cork it tightly. If 
this should not be quite salt enough, a little 
more may be added before it is boiled the 
last time. Put a tablespoonful of sweet oil 
on the top of each bottle before it is corked 
to exclude the air. 



M. DeBalzac was lying awake in bed, when he 
saw a man enter his room cautiously, and attempt 
to pick the lock of his writing desk. The rogue 
was not a little disconcerted at hearing a loud 
laugh from the occupant of the apartment, whom 
he supposed asleep. " Why do you laugh?" asked 
the thief. "I am laugliing, my good fellow," said 
M. DeBalzac, "to think what pains you are taking, 
and what risk j^ou run, in hope of finding money 
b}' night in a desk where the lawful owner can never 
find any by day I" The thief '' evacuated Flan- 
ders" at once.

STEWED TOMATOES. 

235. If they are not very ripe, pour 
boiling water over them, and let them stand 
a few minutes, when the skin will peel oflf 
very easily. Then cut them up, put them 
in a stew-pan without any water, and cook 
them till they are soft. If they prove too 
juicy, dip some of the water out, and mash 
them fine. Season with butter, Cayenne 
pepper, and salt. They may be thickened 
with bread crumbs or grated cracker if 
preferred. 

Humane Driver Rewarded. — A poor Macedo- 
nian soldier was one day leading before Alexander 
a mule laden with gold for* the king's use. The 
beast being so tired that he was not able either to 
go or to sustain the load, the driver took it up and 
carried it, though with great diflficult3^ Alexander 
seeing him just sinking under the burden and going 
to throw it on the ground, cried out, " Friend, do 
not be weary yet — try to carr}^ it right through to 
your tent, for it is all your own." 



240 THE YOUNG ^IFE's COOK BOOK. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

238. Wash them, and cut them in two 
parts, round the tomato — that is, so as the 
cells can be divested of the pulp and seeds 
which they contain. To six tomatoes, take 
half a pint of bread crumbs, one large onion 
finely chopped, one ounce of butter, pepper 
and salt to the taste. Fill the cells of each 
piece with the dressing, put two halves 
together, and tie them with a piece of 
thread. Put them in a pan with an ounce 
of butter and a gill of water, set them in a 
moderate oven, and cook them till they are 
soft. 



TOMATOES WITH CREAM GRAVY. 

237. Cut the tomatoes in half, and 
season them with pepper and salt ; then fry 
them in fresh lard. When they are brown 
on both sides, add some butter and cream ; 
thicken the gravy with butter and flour 
mixed as for drawn butter. ^ Tomatoes pre-

A GENTLEMAN met a half-witted lad in the road, 
and placing in his hands a sixpence and a penny, 
asked him which of the two he would choose. The 
lad replied that " he wouldn't be greedy, he'd keep 
the littlest/'' 



CELERY SAUCE. 

238. Wash two heads of fine white 
celery, and cut it into small pieces ; put it 
into a pint and a quarter of new milk, and 
simmer till quite tender (about an hour), 
then rub it through a fine sieve. Beat the 
yolks of four fresh eggs with a gill of thick 
cream, mix all together, and stir over a 
gentle fire for five or six minutes, till the 
sauce thickens, and serve as directed. 

When in company at college, a general question 
arose among the young men, " What wei-e their 
fathers?" When it was Home Tooke's turn to 
answer, he said his was "a Turkey merchant." He 
was a poulterer in Clare-Market.

CELERY DRESSED AS SLAW. 

239. Cut the celery in pieces about a 
quarter of an inch long. Make a dressing 
of the yolks of three eggs boiled hard, half 
a gill of vinegar, half a gill of sweet oil, 
one teaspoonful of French mustard, or half 
a teaspoonful of common mustard, with salt 
and Cayenne pepper to the taste. Pour this 
mixture over the celery, stir it well, and 
send it to the table. It should be kept in 
cold water, to make it crisp, until about 
fifteen minutes before it is sent to the table, 
then drain it and pour the dressing over.

CELERY STEWED WITH LAMB. 

(FRENCH FASHION.) 

240. Take six neck chops, -crack the 
bone of each across the middle, and put 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 243 

tliem into a stew-pan. Cut up and wash 
two large heads of celery and mix with the 
meat; pepper and salt to the taste. Roll 
two ounces of butter in a little flour and 
add to it, with half a gill of water. Cover 
it closely, and let it simmer slowly till the 
celery is soft. If the gravy stews away too 
much, add a little water ; and if it should 
not be quite thick enough, stir in a little 
flour mixed with cold water. 



BOILED DRIED BEANS. 

241. Put a piece o| pickled pork in a 
pot with two quarts of water. In another 
pot put one quart of dried beans, which 
must have been carefully picked and 
washed. As soon as the beans begin to 
boil take them out, put them in a colander 
to drain, then put them in with the meat, 
and just cover the whole with w^ater. Boil 
them till they are quite soft, and send them 
to the table.

"Jem," said a little boy who was boasting of his 
father's new house, " we have got such a fine por- 
tico, and mahogany doors, and plate-glass windows I 
and on the top is a cupola — and it's going to have 
something else." " What is it?" asked his inter- 
ested companion. " Why, I heard father tell mother 
this morning that we are going to have a mortgage 
upon it I" 



GREEN PEAS. 



242. These should be boiled in very 
little water, with a teaspoonful of salt to 
a pint of water; and if the peas are not 
very sweet add a little sugar. When they 
are young, fifteen minutes is sufficient to 
boil them. Drain ®th em, and add butter, 
pepper, and salt, to the taste. 

Two gardeners, who were neighbors, had their 
crops of early peas killed by the frost. One of 
them came to condole with the other. "Ah !" cried 
he, "how unfortunate! Do you know, neighbor, 
I've done nothing but fret ever since. But, bless 
me ! you seem to have a fine crop coming up ; what 
sort are they?" "Why, those are what I sowed 
immediately after my loss." " What 1 coming up 
already?" "Yes," replied the other, ''while you 
were fretting^ I was working .'" 



THE YOUNG TTIFe's COOK BOOK. 245 
CARROTS A-LA-FRANCAISE. 

243. Scrape the carrots, cut the small 
ends into two, and the large ends into eight 
pieces. Boil in water, with a dessertspoon- 
ful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
for one hour ; drain on a cloth ; place them 
in a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, 
and shake them till the butter is nearly 
absorbed by the carrots ; pour in half a pint 
of new milk, and simmer gently for an hour. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs, place the carrots 
on a vegetable dish, stir the eggs into the 
milk, and simmer two minutes. Pour the 
sauce over the carrots and serve. 



Peter the Great. — When the Ambassador of 
Peter the Great was arrested for debt in London, 
in Queen Anne's reign, the Czar expressed his 
astonishment and indignation that the persons who 
had thus violated the respect due to the representa- 
tive of a crowned head, were not immediately put 
to death. His astonishment was considerably in- 
creased, when he was told that the sovereign of the 
country had no power to dispense with the laws, to 
which he was himself subject. 



246 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

CARROTS WITH FLAVOR, AND CARROTS 
WITHOUT. 

244. When you are about to boil 
carrots do not scrape them, but first brush 
and then wash them. When cooked, rub 
off the skin with the back of the knife. 
The improvement in the flavor is very 
great, because the juice has been kept in. 
The carrot is more affected by the ordinary 
system of peeling or scraping than the 
potato, because the former contains a large 
proportion of sugar in a soluble form. 
Those who try this, will learn to estimate 
the difference of carrots with flavor and 
carrots without. / 

A TRAVELLER once related, with all seriousness, 
to a company of persons, that he had passed 
throuo-h the five divisions of the earth ; and that, 
among other curiosities, he had met with one of 
which no writer had made mention. This, accord- 
ing to his account, was a huge cabbage, which had 
grown so broad and high, that fifty armed riders 
might have stationed themselves under a single 
leaf and performed their manoeuvres. Some one 
who heard him, deeming this exaggeration not 
worth serious refutation, said, with assumed seri- 
ousness, that he too had been abroad as far as 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 247 

Japan, Tvhere, to his astonishment, he saw more 
than three hundred coppersmiths at work making 
a single kettle ; and within the same, were five hun- 
dred women polishing it. "Nonsense !" exclaimed 
the traveller, ** what possible use could they have 
for so large a kettle?" "Usel why, to boil the 
cabbage which you saw I" 



EGG-PLANT. 

(FRENCH MODE.) 

245. Cut an egg-plant in half, but do 
not cut off the rind ; then with a sharp 
knife score it very deeply, both lengthwise 
and crosswise, but be careful not to break 
the skin in so doing. Place each half in a 
pan with the scored side up, season it with 
pepper and salt, and over this pour some 
sweet oil, or melted butter if preferred. Set 
it in an oven and cook it slowly till the 
plant is perfectly soft. The top should be 
brown. 



248 THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

BROWNED EGG-PLANT. 
246. Boil an egg-plant in water which 
has been salted until it is perfectly soft. 
When done, take it out of the water, cut it 
in half, and scoop out all the inside ; mash 
it very fine, and to every teacupful of 
mashed egg-plant add one tablespoonful of 
grated cracker, and a dessertspoonful of 
butter, with salt and pepper to the taste. 
Put it in the dish it is to be served in, beat 
an egg light, spread a portion of it over 
the egg-plant, then strew on some grated 
cracker — and lastly, spread over the re- 
mainder of the egg. Set it in the oven 
and brown it. Serve it hot. 

A BACHELOR friend of onrs, who went for a week 
to a watering-place, left a boarding-house, in which 
there was a number of old maids, on account of 
" the miserable fair^^ set before him at the table I 



MOCK OYSTERS. 
247. Take six ears of new corn and 
grate and scrape them well. Beat one egg 



THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 249 

very light, and add to it, beating all well 
together, one tablespoonful of flour, one 
tablespoonful of cream, and a little pepper 
and salt. Then mix all together and fry 
them in lard or butter. 



MOCK OYSTER FRITTERS. 

248. Wash some roots of salsify, grate 
them, and season with pepper and salt. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs very light, stir 
them into a pint of milk and enough flour 
to make a batter. Whisk the whites dr}^, 
and add them gradually with the salsify to 
the batter. Dip out a spoonful at a time, 
and fry them like other fritters. 



CORN OYSTERS. 

249. One pint of grated green corn, 
two eggs, and as much wheat flour as will 
make it adhere together. Beat the eggs. 



250 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

mix them with the grated corn, and add 
enough flour to form the whole into a paste. 
Fry them of a light brown, in hot lard. 



ASPARAGUS. 

250. Scrape your asparagus, tie them 
up in small bunches, and boil them in a pot 
of water with some salt in it. Before you 
dish them up, toast some nice slices of 
bread, lay the asparagus on the toast, and 
pour rich melted butter over them. 



SUCCOTASH. 



251. One quart of green corn cut ofl* 
the cob, one quart of lima beans, and two 
pounds of pickled pork. If the pork should 
be very salt, soak it an hour before it is put 
on to boil. Put the pork on to boil, and let 
it be about half cooked before the vegetables 



THE TOUXG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 251 

are put it. Then put in the corn (which 
must be cut off the cob) and the beans. 
Let them boil till they are tender. Take 
all up, put the meat on a dish, and the 
vegetables in a tureen. It should be a very 
thick soup when done. 

P. M. AND A. M. — "I say, Jim," inquired a young 
urchin of his companion, but a few 3'ears older than 
himself, "what does P. M. mean after them figures 
on that ere Railway bill ?" Jim responds, conscious 
of his own wisdom, " Pennv-a-mile, to be sure !" 
"Well, and A. M. ?" "Oh, that means — that 
means," said Jim, hesitating, "that means an 
apen'y a mile !" 



COLD SLAW. 

252. Cut a cabbage in half, and with 
a sharp knife shave it down very finely. 
Make a dressing of one egg well beaten, 
half a gill of vinegar, salt to taste, and a 
teaspoonful of butter. Beat the egg light, 
and add to it the vinegar, salt, and butter. 
As soon as the egg is thick, take it off the 
fire, set it away to cool — then pour it over 



252 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

the cabbage, and mix it well together. 
Some prefer a little sugar in the egg and 
vinegar. 



HOT SLAW. 
253. Cut the cabbage in half, and 
shave it very finely. Put it into a stew- 
pan, with a piece of butter, and salt to the 
taste. Pour in just enough water to pre- 
vent it from sticking to the pan. Cover it 
closely, and let it stew. Stir it frequently, 
and when it is quite tender, add a little 
vinegar, and serve it hot. 

An Irish lawyer of the Temple, having occasion 
to go to dinner, left these directions written, and put 
them in the key-hole of his chamber door: " I have 
gone to the Elephant and Castle, where you shall 
find me. If you can't read this note, carry it down 
to the stationer's and he will read it for you." 



THE RHUBARB LEAF AS A GREEN 
VEGETABLE. 

254. Take the leaf (the youngest is 

the best) and divest it of the five stems that 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 253 

run to the right and left hands, and up the 
centre in connection with the fruit (those 
stems containing nearly all the fruit quali- 
ties of the rhubarb itself). The leaves 
should then be placed in boiling water, and 
kept boiling fast for twenty minutes ; after 
which well press them to exclude all liquor; 
and with the necessary condiments of the 
table it will be found a welcome substitute 
for ordinary vegetable, while its medicinal 
properties, as a mild aperient, are upon a 
par with the rhubarb. To please the 
palates of the most fastidious, and lovers 
of spinach, it may be dished up as that 
article in the following way : After boiling 
and pressing, place it in a saucepan without 
water, let it simmer for ten minutes with a 
small quantity of butter, pepper, and salt — 
and when done it will puzzle some of the 
finest connoisseurs to detect the difference. 

QuiN had a gardener who was very slow. 
"Thomas," said he, "did you ever see a snail?" 
" Certainly." ''Then," rejoined the wit, "you must 
have met him, for you could never overtake him I" 



254 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

ENDIVE MAY BE COOKED AS A DINNER 
VEGETABLE. 

255. Endive forms an excellent vege- 
table when cooked for the dinner-table in 
the following manner. Take two good 
endives, not blanched, separate the leaves, 
and boil them in two waters to extract the 
bitter. If still bitter, use a third water. 
Ten minutes before they are ready, throw 
in a handful of sorrel leaves. When soft, 
take them out and strain them ; then put 
them back in the saucepan with a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut; season with 
pepper and salt, and add a little of any rich 
gravy. Shake them well over the fire, and 
serve as hot as possible. Or, boil the 
endive, then put it into cold water; drain 
the water off, and press it well out ; take a 
good tablespoonful of flour, and a piece of 
batter about the size of a walnut; mix 
them well near the fire ; put this mixture 
with the vegetable, and about a teacupful 
of gravy or water; add a little salt and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 255 

pepper, and stew till quite hot, taking care 
to avoid burning. 

There are some happy moments in this lone 

And desolate world of ours that well repay 
The toil of struggling through it, and atone 

For many a long sad night, and weary day. 
They come upon the mind like some wild air 

Of distant music, when we know not where, 
Or whence, the sounds are brought from, and 
their power, 

Though brief, is boundless. 



PEA TOPS USED AS AN ORDINARY 
VEGETABLE. 

256. A delicious vegetable for the table 
may be obtained by sowing peas in shal- 
low boxes, at intervals during the winter 
months. They will come up slowly, but 
strongly. When about ^ve inches high, 
cut them for use, and boil them in the same 
way that cabbage is done. Dish up plainly, 
to be eaten as an ordinary green vegetable. 

The clothes do much upon the wit, as weather 
Does upon the brain ; and then, sir, comes your 

proverb, 
The tailor makes the man. 



256 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

A VERY NICE AND NOVEL DISH WHERE 
WATER-CRESSES ARE PLENTIFUL. 

257. Collect a tolerably large quantity 
of water-cresses. This may be done by 
children on a holiday, affording them 
healthful recreation. Lay the cress in 
strong salt and water, to free it from 
insects. Pick, and wash nicely, and stew 
in water for about ten minutes. Drain and 
chop. Season with pepper and salt, add a 
little butter, and return it to the stewpan 
until well heated. Before serving, add a 
little vinegar, and put around the dish 
pieces of toast, or fried bread. The above, 
made thin, is a good substitute for parsley 
and butter, as a sauce for boiled fowl. 

An old physician was declaiming upon the pro- 
pensity which a majority of people display for 
eating unripe fruit and vegetables. Said he, 
" There is not a vegetable growing in our garden 
that is not best when arrived at maturity, and 
most of them are positively injurious unless fully 
ripe." " I know one thing that ain't so good when 
it's ripe as 'tis green," interrupted a little boy, in 
a very confident but modest manner. " What's 
that?" sharply said the physician, vexed at having 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 207 

his principle disputed by a mere bo3\ "A cucum- 
ber 1^'' responded the lad. The doctor winked his 
eyes, but said nothing. 



PIES PUDDINGS, DESSERT. 

PUFF-PASTE. 

258. One pound of butter, one pound 
of flour. Wash your butter in cold water 
to extract the salt; work it well with a 
broad wooden spoon in order to get out all 
the water. Lay it between clean napkins, 
put it in a tin pan or plate, set it on the ice 
to get hard, but do not let it freeze. Sift 
your flour in a pan, cut the butter in four 
equal parts, cut one fourth in very small 
pieces in the flour, but do not touch it, as 
the warmth of your hands will make the 
paste heavy. Add to the flour as much 
cold water as will make it a stiff dough. 
Turn it out on your pie-board, roll it gently 
into sheets, cut one third of the remainder 

16 



258 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of the butter into small pieces and lay over 
it, sprinkle on a very little flour, fold it 
over, roll it out again, cut one half of the 
butter which is left in small pieces and lay 
on, put on a little flour, and fold it as 
before, roll it out again, and put on the 
remainder of the butter. It should now be 
set on the ice, but should not come in 
contact with it. When it is perfectly cold, 
roll it out into a sheet thinner in the centre 
than at the edges of your pie. Cut it with 
a very sharp knife the size you wish it. 
Fill with whatever you choose, and bake in 
a tolerably quick oven. 



PASTRY. 

259. The flour for pastry should be of 
the whitest and finest quality. It should 
be mixed with a broad knife, as the 
moisture and warmth of the hand makes 
it heavy. The butter should be of the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 259 

best quality, as if it is a little rancid it will 
taste. To make pufF-paste, it should have 
all the salt washed out of it. Iron, or 
block-tin plates are the best for baking 
pastry. Always use cold water (in summer 
iced water) to mix pastry, and if it cannot 
be baked immediately set it away in a cool 
place. 



KHTJBARB PIE, OR TART. 
260. Take the stalks from the leaves, 
and peel off" the thin skin ; cut them into 
pieces about an inch long, and as you do so 
sprinkle a little fine sugar into the basin. 
For a quart basin heaped, take one pound 
of common lump sugar ; put the rhubarb 
into it, with a tablespoonful of water, and 
as it simmers shake the pan often over the 
fire. It will turn yellow at first, but keep 
it very gently doing until it greens, and 
then take it off. When cold, lay it in the 
tart dish, with only as much syrup as will 



260 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

make it very moist. Put a light crust over 
it, and when that is baked the tart will be 
done enough. Quarter the crust, and fill 
the dish with custard or cream. Many 
persons think the flavor of the rhubarb 
injured by taking off the peel. 

The fashion of shaving the beard was introduced 
into Greece about the time of Alexander the Great. 
Its absence was at first, however, regarded as a 
mark of effeminacy, and was adopted onl}^ by low 
persons and fops. Diogenes, one day meeting a 
man with a smoothly-shaven chin, inquired of him 
whether he shaved as a reproach to nature for 
havinof made him a man and not a woman. 



TO PREPARE APPLES FOR PIES. 

261. Pare and core your apples, cut 
them in slices, and throw them into cold 
water. Then take them out of the water 
and put them into a stewpan. If the apples 
are tender, the water which adheres to them 
will be sufficient to cook them ; if not, a 
little more may be added. Cover the stew- 
pan, and place them near the fire. Let 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 261 

them stew till thej are soft, and burst ; 

then mash them, and add half an ounce 

of butter to each pint of the stewed 

apples. When they get nearly cold, add 

sugar, rose water, and nutmeg to the taste. 

An arch boy being at a table where there was a 
piping hot apple pie, putting a bit into his mouth, 
burnt it so that the tears ran down his cheeks. A 
gentleman that sat by asked him why he wept. 
" Only," said he, "because it has just come to my 
remembrance that my poor grandmother died this 
day twelvemonth. " Phoo," said the other, " is that 
all ?" So, whipping a large piece into his mouth, 
he quickly S3'mpathized with the boj^ who, seeing 
his eyes brim full, asked him, with a malicious 
sneer, why he wept? "Plague on you," said he, 
" because you were not hanged, j'ou young dog, the 
same day your grandmother died !" 



APPLE TART WITH aUINCE. 
262. Prepare the apples as for apple 
pie, and lay them in a dish. Then stew 
two quinces, with a little water, sugar, and 
butter, and pour them on the apples. Then 
add a layer of pounded sugar, and the rind 
of a lemon grated. Cover with puff-paste,

A GENTLEMAN Calling One morning on a female 
friend, was answered by the servant that she was 
not at home. " Thank you, give her this," said he,

unexpected gift, " I will give it to her while you 
waitV 



PEACH POT PIE.

make one dumpling. 

The following notice appeared on the wall of a 
meeting-house: "Anybody sticking bills against 
this church, will be prosecuted according to law or 
any other nuisance." 



CHEAP CRUST FOR DUMPLINGS. 

267. Boil about six good-sized potatoes, 
mash them with a teacupful of milk and a 
very small piece of butter, and salt to taste.

Don't judge by Appearances. — Coleridge, being 
seated at dinner opposite to a silent gentleman 
with a high forehead, theorized himself into an 
exalted opinion of that person's intellectual pow- 
ers. He was impatient to hear the stranger speak, 
feeling almost certain that, when he did, he would 
utter something profound and original. His wish 
was presenth' fulfilled. A dish of apple dumplings 
having been placed before them, the rigid features 
of the intellectual gentleman gradually rehixed 
from a smile to a grin — and rubbing his hand, he 
exclaimed, "Them's the jockey's for mel" 



THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 267 
APPLE DUMPLINGS, No. 2. 

270. Scoop out the cores of the apples, 
and fill up the centre with a mixture of 
butter and sugar. Make a nice paste, take 
a lump of the proper size, enclose the apple 
in it, and boil the dumplings in nets in 
place of cloths. 



DUMPLINGS WITHOUT PASTE. 

271. Pare and core your apples or 
quinces ; clean some rice, by rubbing it in 
a clean dry cloth, but do not wet it. Dip 
each apple or quince in water, then roll it 
in the rice. Tie each dumpling in a cloth, 
and boil them until the rice is soft. 

Miss Speckles says, " The best vegetable pill

then squeeze dry and stir with a spoon 
until reduced to a mash, before it is mixed 
with the flour. Cut in small pieces, two 
ounces each of preserved citron, orange and 
lemon peel, and add quarter of an ounce of 
mixed spice ; quarter of a pound of moist 
sugar should be put into a basin, with eight 
eggs, and well beaten together with a three- 
pronged fork ; stir this with the pudding, 
and make it of a proper consistence with 
milk. Remember that it must not be made 
too thin, or the fruit will sink to the bottom, 
but be made to the consistence of good thick 
batter. Two wineglassfuls of brandy should 
be poured over the fruit and spice, mixed 
together in a basin, and allowed to stand 
three or four hours before the pudding is

made, stirring them occasionally. It must 
be tied in a cloth, and will take five hours 
of constant boiling. When done, turn it out 
on a dish, sift loaf sugar over the top, and 
serve it with wine sauce in a boat, and some 
poured round the pudding. The pudding 
will be of considerable size, but half the 
quantity of materials, used in the same pro- 
portion, will be equally good. In addition 
to the wine-sauce, have a metal sauce-boat 
filled with brandy; set it alight on the 
table, and pour a portion of it in a flame 
upon each slice of pudding. It wdll be 
found a great improvement. 

When the late Lord Paget was ambassador at 
Constantinople, he, with the rest of the gentlemen 
who were in a public capacity at the same court, 
determined on one gala day to have each of them a 
dish dressed after the manner of their respective 
countries, and Lord Paget, for the honor of England, 
ordered a piece of roast beef, and a plum pudding. 
The beef was easily cooked, but the court cooks 
not knowing how to make a plum pudding, he gave 
them a receipt. " So many eggs, so much milk, so 
much flour and a given quantity of raisins ; to be 
beaten up together, and boiled for three hours." 
When dinner was served up, first came the French

ship. " I forgot the bag, and these stupid scoun- 
drels have boiled it without one — and in five gallons 
of water, too." It was a noble mess of plum broth. 



A DELICIOUS PLUM PUDDING WITHOUT 
EGGS. 

273. Take a coffee cup full of mashed 
potatoes, and one of carrots, which must

#fc currants, half a pound of sugar, two ounces 
of candied lemon peel, two ounces of 
citron, the grated peel of a lemon, ten bitter 
almonds, and mixed spice to your taste. 
Mix all well together, and add a glass

A GENTLEMAN dining at a hotel where servants 
were few and far between ; despatched a lad among 
them for a plate of pudding. After a long time the

An old gentleman who had never before seen 
finger glasses, and who felt called upon to take 
every thing set before him, drank off the contents 
of his vessel, when the butler put down another;

and squeeze out all the superfluous water ; 
then well mash the pieces of bread, and 
mix with it half a pound of flour, a quarter 
of a pound of currants which have been 
cleaned, four ounces of suet chopped fine, 
half of a pound of sugar, and two teaspoon- 
fuls of fresh ground cinnamon ; then grease 
the inside of a baking dish with a bit of 
suet, put the pudding into it, and bake it 
for two hours. Or it may be tied in a clean 
floured cloth, set in boiling water, with a 
plate at the bottom, and boiled for the 
same time.

them in small pieces, and stew them in 
very little water till they are soft. Pass 
them through a sieve to free them from 
lumps. Beat the butter and sugar smooth ; 
whisk the eggs, and add to it ; then stir in 
the apples (which should be half a pound 
when mashed), brandy or rosewater, and 
nutmeg. Cover your pie plates with a rich

leaving a large opening in the centre. Pour 
in a spoonful or two of water, and bake in 
a moderate oven. Peaches are very good 
prepared in the same manner. 

Captain Marryat expressed the opinion, in his

into the syrup twenty-four good apples, 
peeled and sliced, and keep it stirred until 
it becomes a thick marmalade.* Put it into 
a mould until quite cold, then turn it oy^ 
upon a dish ; have a few spoonfuls of 
currant jelly melted over the fire ; add a 
glass of rum, and when partly cold pour 
over, and serve with whipped cream in the 
centre, flavored with orange. 

Furnish thyself with the proper accommodations 
belonging to thy condition ; yet spend not to the 
utmost of what thou canst aftbrd, that the provi- 
dence of thy youth ma^^ be a comfort to thy old age. 



FRENCH COMPOTE OF APPLES. 

297. Boil one pound of rice (well 
washed) in plenty of water. When well 
boiled, add one ounce of butter, and stir it 

round ; then add one tablespoonful of sugar.

290 THE YOUKG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

The rice should not be boiled in more water 
than it will consume. Peel and slice six 
apples, take out the core and pips, put them 
in a stewrpan, with six slices of beet-root and 
a pint of water. Stew until all is tender. 
Mash them up together with a little butter 
and sugar. The beet-root ought to have 
given a nice pink color to the apples, and 
improved the flavor. When done, place the 
rice which is ready on a dish ; form a well 
or hole in the midst of the rice, in w^hich 
place the apple. Have ready a small 
quantity of sauce, made with a little cream, 
butter and sugar, which pour over the rice, 
and serve. 

The greatest truths are the simplest; the greatest 
men and women are sometimes so too. 



APPLE MIROTON. 

298. Peel, core, and slice twenty fine 
apples ; melt a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, and stir in it half a pound of sugar, 



THE YOUNG ^^IFE S COOK BOOK. 291 

the peel of one lemon grated, and the juice 
of two. Fry the apples in this mixture, 
and serve them in a dish. 

Definition of Steam. — "Pray, sir," said an old 
lady to a very pompous-looking old gentleman who 
was talking loudly about steam power, " Pray, sir, 
what is steam?" "Steam, ma'am, is, ah! — steam 
is — eh? ah 1 — steam is — steam!" "I knew that 
chap couldn't tell ye," said a rough-looking fellow 
standing by, "but steam is a bucket of water in a 
tremendous perspiration 1" 



APPLES BUTTERED. 

299. Peel and core apples of the 
choicest kind, stew in their syrup as many 
as will fill the dish, and make a marmalade 
of the rest. Cover the dish with a thin 
layer of marmalade ; place the apples on 
this, with a bit of butter in the heart of 
each ; lay the rest of the marmalade into 
the vacancies. Bake in the oven to a pale 
brown color, and powder with sugar. 

Quarrels. — Two things, well considered, would 
prevent many quarrels. First, to have it well

ascertained whether we are not disputing about 
terms, rather than things ; and secondly, to ex- 
amine whether that on which we differ is worth 
contendins: about. 



APPLES WITH CUSTARD. 

300. Pare and core some apples, and 
bake or stew them with as little water as 
possible, and enough sugar to sweeten them. 
When the apples are soft, put them into a 
pie dish, and let them stand till cold ; then 
pour over them an unboiled custard, and 
set the dish into an oven or before the fire 
until the custard is thick. This may be 
eaten either hot or cold. 

He that likes a liot dinner, a warm welcome, new 
ideas, and old wine, will not often dine with the 
great. 



APPLE CHARLOTTE. 

301. Peel, core, and slice one dozen 
large-sized apples, and stew them with half 
a pound of sugar, one ounce of butter, the 



THE YOUNG "^IFE'S COOK BOOK. 293 

peel of one lemon, half a stick of cinna- 
mon, and half a pint of water. Continue 
boiling them until the mixture becomes a 
thick paste. Line the bottom and side of 
a mould with -thin pieces of bread dipped in 
clarified butter. Fill the space with the 
apple marmalade, and cover the whole with 
a piece of bread dipped in clarified butter. 
Bake it in a hot oven till it is of a pale 
brown color, and when done, turn out, and 
serve in a dish. 

Sometimes a name will excite a remark. All the 
papers copied the marriage of Mr. Apple and Sarah 
Apple ; but we could see no impropriety in making 
the two apples into one pair 1 



BAKEWELL PUDDING. 

302. Cover a deep dish with a rich 
paste, over which spread raspberry or any 
kind of jam. Let the jam be spread an

away to get cold. Beat five eggs and stir 
them into the cold arrow-root with as much 
sugar as will make it quite sweet. Butter 
a deep dish, pour in the mixture and bake 
it. When served, ornament the top with 
jelly or fresh fruit, whole or sliced. 



ARROW-ROOT PUDDING. 

305. Dissolve three tablespoonfuls of 
arrow-root in cold milk, beat three eggs very 
light and add to the milk. Then pour the

ter, and three eggs well beaten. Add sugar 
enough to make it quite sweet. Line your 
pie plates with rich paste, pour in the above 
mixture, and bake in a rather quick oven. 

The royal Dardanelles. — A 3^0 ung man who 
had travelled much, thought he could give as truth 
everything that passed through his head. Once, as 
he boasted having seen all the crowned heads of 
Europe, somebody asked him: "Have you seen the 
Dardanelles too ?" The boaster, thinking that they 
were some princes that bore that name, replied, 
** Of course 1 have seen them, since I dined several 
times with them.'* 



SCOTCH PUDDING. 

307. Mix together one pint of milk, a

CHESHIRE PUDDING. 

308. Make a good paste of flour and 
butter. Roll it thin, and cut it into strijDS 
about six or eight inches wide. Spread, on 
these strips of paste, some fruit jam or

A Scotch family removed to London, wished to 
have a sheep's head, prepared as they were accus- 
tomed to at iiome, and sent a servant to the butcher's 
to procure one. '* My gude man," said she to the 
butcher, " I want a sheep's head." " There's plenty 
of them," replied he; "choose which you will." 
" Na," said she, 'that winna do ; I want a sheep's 
head that will sing (singe)." " Go, you idiot," said 
he; "who ever heard of a sheep's head that could 
sing." " Wh}^," replied she in wrath, "it's ye that 
are the idiot ; for sheep's head in Scotland can sing ; 
but I discover yer English sheep are just as gr^it 
fules as their owners, and they can do naething as 
they ocht." 



BAKED COCOANUT PUDDING.

in a moderate oven about an hour and a 

quarter. Turn out carefully, and serve. 

This pudding may also be boiled ; it requires 

three hours. Serve with thick cream, and 

sugar sifted over. 

A BARRISTER once tormented a witness with ques- 
tions, until he declared himself to be so exhausted 
that he could not proceed without a drink of water. 
Upon this the judge remarked, "I think, sir, you 
must have done with the witness now for you have 
pumped him dry."

If thou belie vest a thing impossible, th}^ despon- 
dency shall make it so ; but he that persevereth 
shall overcome all difficulty. 



CORN PUDDING, No. 1. 

313. Grate one dozen ears of corn. 
Add to this, three eggs well beaten, a little

"Is there much water in the cistern, Bidd}^?" 
inquired a gentleman of an Irish servant, as she 
came from the kitchen. " It's full on the bottom, 
sir, but there^s none at all on the top !^^ 



302 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
INDIAN PUDDING. 

316. Boil a quart of milk, and stir 
into it while boiling as much Indian meal 
as will make it into a mush. Boil it ten 
minutes, add some salt, and two ounces of 
butter. When it is cool, stir in four eggs, 
which should be first beaten very light; 
add as much sugar as required ; grate some 
nutmeg into it, and stir in three or four 
tablespoonfuls of brandy. Line your pud- 
ding dishes with paste, pour in the above 
mixture, and bake them. 

Superficial Knowledge. — The profoundly wise 
do not declaim against superficial knowledge in 
others, so much as the profoundly ignorant. On 
the contrary, they would rather assist it with their 
advice, than overwhelm it with their contempt; for 
they know that there was a period when even a 
Bacon or a Newton were superficial — and that he 
who has a little knowledge, is far more likely to get 
more than he that has none. 



PUMPKIN PUDDING. 



317. A quarter of a pound of butter, 
sugar to the taste, eight eggs, two table-

one pint of mashed pumpkin. Stew the 
pumpkin in very little water, mash it fine, 
and add the butter to it whilst it is hot. 
Whisk the eggs, and stir into the pumpkin 
when it is cool enough, and add the other 
ingredients. Bake in a light paste. 

A GENTLEMAN walking out in some meadows, one 
evening, observed a great number of rats in the act 
of going from one place to another, which they are 
in the habit of doing. He stood perfectlj' still, and 
the whole troop passed close to him. His astonish- 
ment, however, was great, when he saw an old blind 
rat, which held a piece of stick at one end of his 
mouth, while another rat had hold of the other end 
of it. In this way he was leading his blind com- 
panion. 



FRUIT PUDDING. 



318. One quart of flour, two spoonfuls 
of good baking powder, and a little salt. 
Mix to the consistency of drop biscuit with 
cold milk or water; add two tablespoonfuls

tin pail and lay in it a layer of the batter, 
then a layer of any kind of fresh small 
fruit, alternating them until the vessel is 
filled. Cover tight, and steam an hour and 
a half. Eat with liquid sauce. This is 
excellent without either milk or eggs. 



PEACH CHARLOTTE. 

319. Line the bottom and sides of a 
dish with slices of fresh sponge cake. Pare 
some ripe peaches, cut them in halves, 
sprinkle sugar over them, and fill up the 
dish. Then whisk a pint of sweetened 
cream ; as the froth rises, take it off" till all 
is done. Pile the cream on the top of the 
peaches and send it to the table. 

A Bright Idea. — When the British entered 
Lucknow, the Highlanders' piper, who had lost his 
way, suddenl}' found one of the enemy's cavalry, 
sabre in hand, about to cut him down. His rifle 
had been fired off, and he had no time to raise his 
bayonet. "A bright idea," said he afterward, when 
relating the story, " struck me ; all at once I seized 
my bag-pipes and gave forth a shrill tone, which so 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 305 

startled the fellow that he bolted like a shot, evi- 
dently imagining it was some infernal machine. My 
pipes saved my life." 



LEMON PUDDING. 



320. Half a pound of sugar, a quarter 
of a pound of butter, five eggs, the grated 
yellow rind and juice of one lemon. Beat 
the butter and sugar to a cream. Whisk 
the eggs and add to it, then stir in the 
lemon juice and grated rind. Make a paste, 
cover your pie plate, pour in the mixture, 
and bake in a moderate oven. Two table- 
spoonfuls of brandy may be added, if pre- 
ferred, to flavor it. 

"If I am not at home to-night at ten o'clock," 
said a husband to his better half, "don't wait for 
me." "I won't, my dear," replied the lady, signifi- 
cantly. And what do you think she did ? At ten 
o'clock, precisely, she slipped on her bonnet and 
went for him, and gave him a bit of her mind before 
a large company.

GEHMAN PUDDING. 
321. Quarter of a pound of suet chop- 
ped fine, quarter of a pound of bread 
crumbs, quarter of a pound of sugar, three 
good-sized apples cut up small. Butter a 
pan and put in a layer of the bread crumbs, 
then one of suet, then one of apples and 
sugar mixed, seasoned with lemon peel and 
cloves. Continue the layers alternately 
until the pan is full, always putting the 
sugar and apples together. Bake twenty 
minutes. 

How AN Old Lady secured good Puddings. — 
An old gentlewoman, who lived almost entirely on 
puddinos, told us it was a long time before she could 
get them made uniformly good, till she made the 
following rule : If the pudding was good, she let 
the cook have the remainder of it ; if it was not, 
she gave it to her lap-dog. But as soon as this 
resolution was known, poor little Bow-wow seldom 
got the sweet treat after. 



JAM ROLLED PUDDING. 

322. Make a paste with six ounces of 
finely-chopped suet and three quarters of 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 307 

a pound of flour ; roll it out a quarter of an 
inch thick. Spread it over with half a 
pound of any kind of jam. Wet the edge^ 
of the paste all round ; roll it up into the 
form of a bolster ; press the edge to make it 
adhere ; tie it in a cloth ; put it into a pan 
of boiling water, without bending it, and 
boil quickly for an hour and three quarters. 
Turn out carefully, cut the pudding into 
six j)ieces, and serve the cut side uppermost. 
Marmalade, chopped apples, lemon juice, 
and currants, may be used instead of jam 
for a change. 

Good Jam. — Crowd ten fashionably-dressed ladies 
into one stage coach. 



BOILED BATTER PUDDING. 

323. Three eggs, one ounce of butter, 
one pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of 
flour, a little salt. Put the flour into a 
basin, and add suflicient milk to moisten it ; 
carefully rub down all the lumps with a 



-SOS THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

spoon, then pour in the remainder of the 
milk, and stir in the butter, which should 
be previously melted ; keep beating the 
mixture, add the eggs and a pinch of salt, 
and when the batter is quite smooth, put 
into a well-buttered basin, tie it down very 
tightly, and put it into boiling water. 
Move the basin about for a few minutes 
after it is put into the water, to prevent the 
flour settling in any part, and boil for one 
hour and a quarter. This pudding may 
also be boiled in a floured cloth that has 
been wetted in hot water — it will then take 
a few minutes less than when boiled in a 
basin. Send these puddings very quickly 
to table, and serve with sweet sauce, wine 
sauce, stewed fruit, or jam of any kind. 
When the latter is used, a little of it may 
be placed round the dish in small quantities 
as a garnish. 



QuiN was at a small dinner party. There was a 
delicious pudding, of which the master of the house 
begged him to partake. A gentleman had just 







THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 309 

before helped himself to an immense piece of it. 
" Pray," said Quin, looking first at the gentleman's 
plate and then at the dish, "which is the pudding?" 



BLACK-CAP PUDDING. 

324. Make a thin light batter, and 
just before it is poured into the cloth, stir 
to it half a pound of currants, well cleaned 
and dried. These will sink to the lower 
part of the pudding and blacken the surface. 
Boil it the usual time, and dish it with the 
dark side uppermost. Send it to table with 
a sweet sauce. 

It is said that a Chinaman, no matter where he 
finds himself, is never perplexed. He always has

A PUDDING FOR A PRINCE. 

325. Blanch six bitter, and two ounces 
of sweet almonds, boil them twenty minutes 
in the third of a pint of new milk, then

pound them to a paste. When the milk is 
nearly cold, add four well-beaten fresh eggs, 
half a gill of thick cream, and two table- 
spoonfuls of brandy ; rub six ounces of stale 
sponge-cake to crumbs. Mix these ingre- 
dients well, and beat for ten minutes ; stir 
in two ounces of sifted loaf sugar. Butter 
a mould, stick it round in Vandykes with 
dried cherries, pour in the mixture, tie it 
over with writing paper spread with butter, 
and steam over fast-boiling water for an 
hour and three quarters. Serve with sauce. 

A LADY made a complaint to Frederick the Great, 
king of Prussia. "Your majesty," said she, "my

none of your business I" 



COLLEGE PUDDING. 



326. Four eggs, one pint of milk, a 
little salt, flour to make a rather thin 
batter, one dessertspoonful of dissolved 



THE YOUNG TTTFE'S COOK BOOK. 311 

carbonate of ammonia. Beat the yolks of 
the eggs very light, add the salt, milk, and 
flour. The batter must not be thick. Beat 
the whole very hard for ten or fifteen min- 
utes, then stir in gently the whites of the 
egg, which should have been whisked very 
dry. Do not beat the batter after the 
whites are in, only stir it sufficiently to 
incorporate them with it. Lastly, add the 
ammonia. Butter well a cake mould or 
iron pan, pour in the mixture, and bake it 
in an oven about as hot as for bread. This 
pudding is very nice with wine or lemon 
sauce. Cream sauce may be served with it 
if preferred. 



RAILWAY PUDDING. 



327. Flour, suet, sugar, currants, and 
raisins, of each ten ounces ; grated potatoes 
and carrots, together ten ounces; one nut- 
meg and two ounces of candied orange peel,

hours. To be served with brandy sauce. 

There exists in human nature a disposition to 
murmur at the disappointments and calamities 
incident to it, rather than to acknowledge with 
gratitude the blessings by which they are more

ENGLISH MOLASSES PUDDING. 

328. A quarter pound of raw potatoes, 
scraped, a quarter pound of raw carrots, 
scraped, a quarter pound of currants, and 
the same quantity, each, of suet chopped 
fine, and flour; a little salt and allspice. 
Mix all these well together, and make it 
the consistence of a pudding for boiling by 
stirring in molasses. About two tablespoon- 
fuls will be enough, or it may require rather 
more. This should be put into a greased 
pudding mould and boiled two hours. It 
may be served up either with or without 
sweet sauce.

For a man to make mere recreations his main 
actions and grand emplo^'ments, is full as foolish 
and unreasonable as if he should make all his diet 
of phj^sic and sauces, and his whole garment of 
nothiuof but frinsres. 



VICTORIA'S PUDDING. 



329. Three ounces of stale French roll 
in fine crumbs, two ounces of sweet almonds,

ratafias, three ounces of loaf sugar, two 
ounces of beef marrow, chopped, one ounce 
of baked flour, half a pint of milk, and three 
fresh eggs ; mix these ingredients, and beat 
them briskly for ten minutes, then let it 
stand in a cool place for an hour ; beat 
again for ten minutes, put it into a mould 
rubbed well with butter, and tastefully 
stuck with dried cherries or raisins (stoned) ; 
tie a cloth over, put it into plenty of boiling 
water, and boil fast for two hours and a 
half.

AN EXCELLENT FAMILY PUDDING OF COLD 
POTATOES, WITH EGGS, ETC. 

330. Take some cold potatoes, bruise 
them through a colander with a wooden 
spoon ; then beat up eggs with a pint of 
good milk, and stir in the potatoes — the 
proportion of eggs to potatoes should be four 
eggs to six large or twelve middle-sized 
potatoes ; sugar and season to taste ; bake 
half an hour. A little peach marmalade, or 
any kind of jam or preserves may be eaten 
with it. 

The proof of a pudding is in the eating ; the 
proof of a woman is in making the pudding ; and 
the proof of a man is in being able to appreciate 
both. 



A SAVORY OR SWEET DRIPPING PUDDING. 

331. Six ounces of dripping to twelve 
ounces of flour, half of the dripping to be 
well rubbed into the flour, with a little salt; 
then, with water, w^ork into a stiff paste ; 
roll it out thin, and add the remainder of 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 315 

the dripping by spreading it thinly over the 
paste, then fold it over, and roll it out 
again ; repeat the process, and then work 
into a round pudding ; put it into a basin ; 
set it in boiling water, and continue to boil 
for two hours. This may be eaten as a 
sweet pudding, with jam, molasses, or sugar. 

When, in a case of doubtful morality, you feel 
disposed to ask, " Is there an}^ harm in doing this ?" 
pray answer it by asking j^ourself another, " Is 
there any harm in letting it alone ?" 



PUDDING OF CALF'S FEET. 

332. Pick the meat from three well- 
boiled and cleaned calf's feet ; chop it fine 
with half a pound of fresh beef suet ; grate 
the crumb of about half a pound of bread ; 
shred some orange-peel, and some citron to 
taste ; beat six eggs into a froth ; mix these 
ingredients thoroughly together, and add a 
wineglassful of brandy, and half a nutmeg

grated ; boil in a cloth for three hours ; 
serve with sweet sauce. 

All the influence which women enjoy in society, 
the wholesome restraint which they possess over 
the passions of mankind, their power of cheering 
us when old, depends so entirely upon their per- 
sonal purity, that to insinuate a doubt of its real 
value is wilfully to remove the broadest corner- 
stone on which civil society rests, with all its bene- 
fits and all its comforts. 



TAPIOCA PUDDING. 

333. Soak in a quart of water eight 
tablespoonfuls of tapioca, until it is quite 
soft ; then add ^ve eggs well beaten, nutmeg 
and wine or rose water, to your taste. It 
needs no sauce, and may be made as sweet 
as custard. The tapioca needs washing first 
in cold water. Bake it in a buttered dish, 
and have it out of the oven long enough to 
be only warm when eaten. 

Bishop Cumberland, being told b}^ some of bis 
Mends that he would wear himself out by intense 
application, replied in the words of Bacon, " It is

SODA PTJDDIITG. 

334. Mix together four eggs, four tea- 
cupfuls of flour, one of brown sugar, the 
same quantity of butter, and a teaspoonful 
of soda. Bake the pudding in a mould, and

Think. — Thought engenders thought. Place 
one idea upon paper — another will follow it, and 
still another, until you have written a page. You 
cannot fathom your mind. There is a well of 
thought there which has no bottom. The more 
3'OU draw from it the more clear and fruitful it will 
be. If you neglect to think yourself, and use other 
people's thoughts — giving them utterance only, 
you will never know what j^ou are capable of At 
first your ideas ma}'- come out in lumps — homely 
and shapeless ; but no matter, time and perseverance 
will arrange and refine them. Learn to think and 
you will learn to write — the more 3^0 u think the 
better you express your ideas.

fire in a pan of boiling water, and keep the 
custard stirred gently, but without ceasing, 
until it begins to thicken, then move the 
spoon rather more quickly, making it al- 
ways touch the bottom of the jug, until the 
mixture is brought to the point of boiling, 
when it must be instantly taken from the 
fire, or it will curdle in a moment. Pour it 
into a bowl, and keep it stirred until nearly 
cold, then add to it, by degrees, a wineglass- 
ful of good brandy, and two ounces of 
blanched almonds, cut into spikes ; or omit 
these at pleasure. A few bitter ones bruised 
can be boiled in the milk, instead of lemon 
peel, when their flavor is preferred.

Frederick the great, in surveying one evening 
some of the advanced posts of his camp, discoA^ered 
a soldier endeavoring to pass the sentinel. His 
majesty stopped him, and insisted on knowing 
where he was going. " To tell you the truth/^ 
answered the soldier; "^^our majesty has been so

LEMON CREAM. 



347. To one pint of water, add the 
juice of two lemons, or three if small; the

a little, pour in the yolks, also well beaten, 
and keep stirring the cream until sufficiently 
thickened to prevent curdling. It is best to

a pint and a half of cream ; mill it, and as 
the froth rises lay it on a sieve. Put the 
remainder of your cream in glasses, and lay 
the frothed cream upon them. 

The name, Chocolate, is an Indian name, and is 
compounded from atte, or atle, which in the Mexi- 
can language signifies water — and from the sound 
which the water wherein the chocolate is put makes, 
as choco, choco, choco, when it is stirred in a cup 
by an instrument called a molinet.

WHIPPED CREAM. 

351. Sweeten with powdered sugar a 
quart of cream, and add to it a lump of 
sugar which has been rubbed upon the peels

flower water, or any other agreeable essence. 
Whisk the cream thoroughly in a large pan, 
and as tla^e froth rises take it off*, lay it upon 
a sieve placed over another pan, and return 
the cream which drains from the froth, till 
all is whisked — then heap it upon a dish, 
or put it into glasses. Garnish with thinly- 
pared citron, cut into any fanciful shape, 
and serve.

gentle fire till at boiling heat ; strain into a 
basin ; stir in the isinglass and a gill of 
thick cream. Flavor with twenty-five drops 
of any kind of essence, or with three table- 
spoonfuls of Maraschino, Curacaj| or rum. 
Pour the mixture into a mould slightly 
rubbed with the oil of sweet almonds, and 
let it stand in a cool place till firmly set. 

The pride of emptiness is an abomination ; and 
to talk such, is the foolishness of folly. Neverthe- 
less, it is the part of wisdom to bear with patience 
their impertinence, and to pity their absurdity. 



FLOATING ISLAND. 



353. One quart of milk, and the 
whites of three eggs. Sweeten the milk

add one teaspoonful of currant, quince, or 
any kind of jelly you choose ; add also one 
teaspoonful of white sugar to each white. 
Pile the froth upon the milk, and serve it 
soon, as the whites will fall. 

When a malignant man strikes at the great 
benefactors of his race, he deserves, like the Indian 
who madly fired his arrow at the sun, to be smitten

354. Put into a shallow dish half a 
pint of white wine, the peel of a lemon

BLANC MANGE, A-LA-FRANCAISE. 

355. Blanch one pound of sweet and 
twenty bitter almonds, drain them on a 
sieve, and afterward dry them by rubbing 
them in a napkin. Pound them in a 
mortar, moistening them from time to time 
with half a teaspoonful of water, to prevent 
their oiling. When they are pounded as 
fine as possible, take them out of the mortar 
and put them into a pan ; then with a silver 
spoon beat up the almonds gradually with 
half a pint of filtered water. After this, 
spread a napkin over an oval dish, and put 
the almonds upon it; then gather up the 
corners of the napkin, and wring it very

almonds. Put into this milk twelve ounces 
of crystallized sugar, broken into small 
pieces. When the sugar is dissolved, pass 
the whole through a napkin, and add to it 
one ounce of clarified isinglass, made rather 
warm. When the whole is well incorpo- 
rated, pour into the mould, which should be 
previously iced. The blanc mange will be

pound them to a paste. Add by degrees, 
while pounding, the third of a pint of cold 
water. Let it stand for two hours, then 
strain off the liquid. Put the milk, sugar, 
cinnamon, and vanilla, into an enamelled 
saucepan, and boil slowly till the sugar is 
dissolved — then stir in the isinglass. When 
that is dissolved, strain into a basin, and 
stir in the milk of almonds and the cream.

add a quarter of a pound of melted butter, 
two or three teaspoonfuls of good jeast, 
three eggs well beaten, and, if the yeast is 
not salt enough, add a little salt. Let it 
rise, and bake in waffle irons. Be careful 
to grease the irons thoroughly, and bake 
the cakes a rich brown. Some prefer to 
raise the batter by adding soda and sour 
milk, in that case there is no need of yeast. 

There are three things which a good wife should

WAFFLES WITHOUT YEAST. 

363. Three eggs, one pint of milk, one 
teaspoonful of butter, and as much flour

yolks very light, add to the milk and flour 
alternately, beat it well, lastly stir in the 
whites, which must be whisked very dry. 
The batter should not be beaten after the 
whites are in. Grease your wafile irons 
after having heated them, fill them nearly 
full of the batter, close them and place 
them over the fire — turn the irons so as to 
bake the waffles on both sides — when done 
take it out and butter it. These must be 
baked the moment they are mixed.

Faults. — As there are some faults that have been 
termed faults on the right side, so there are some 
errors that might be denominated errors on the safe 
side. Thus, we seldom regret having been too mild, 
too cautious, or too humble ; but we often repent 
having been too violent, too precipitate, or too 
proud

Gray Hair. — The sedentary, the studious, the 
debilitated, and the sickly, are, with very Ifew ex- 
ceptions, those who are earliest visited with gray 
hair. The agricultural laborer, the seaman, and 
all whose employment consists of or involves ex- 
ercise in the open air, are those whose hair latest 
affords signs that the last process has commenced, 
that the fluids have begun to be absorbed, and the 
textures dried up and withered. All whose em- 
ployment renders much sitting necessary, and lit- 
tle or no exercise possible ; all who, from whatever 
cause, have least determination ; particularly if to- 
ward the head, are the persons most lialile to carry 
gray heirs. It is well known that mental emotions 
and violent passions have, in a night, made the hair 
gray. These instances are in the same way to be 
understood and explained. The}^ are owing to the 
increased determination of the blood stimulating 
the absorbents into preternatural activity, and 
causing them to take up the coloring matter of the 
hair.

Old Charles Matthews, in his ^jntertainment 
entitled "At Home," used to tell a story of pulling 
up at a roadside inn, and interrogating the waiter 
as to what he could have for dinner. " Any hot 
joint?" inquired the traveller. " Nn, sir, no hot 
joint, sir." "Any cold one?" "Cold one, sir? 
No, sir, no cold one, sir." " Can yon broil me a 
fowl?" "Fowl, sir? No, sir, no fowl, sir." "No 
fowl, and in a country inn !" exclaimed Matthews. 
" Let me have some eggs and bacon." " Eggs and 
bacon, sir ?" said the waiter; "no egcrs and bacon, 
sir." "Confound it!" at length said the hungry 
traveller, " what have you got in the house ?" " An 
execution, sir," was the prompt response of the 
doleful waiter.

A Melancholy Truism. — In these dixjs half our 
diseases come from the neglect of our body in the 
overwork of the brain. In this railwa}?- age the 
wear and tear of labor and intellect go on without 
pause or self-pity. We live longer than our fore- 
fathers, but we suffer more than a thousand artifi- 
cial anxieties and cares. They fatigued only the 
muscles, we exhaust the finer strength of the nerves ; 
and, when we send impatiently to the doctor, it is 
ten to one but what he finds the acute complaint, 
which is all that we perceive, connected with some 
chronic mental irritation, or some unwholesome in- 
veteracy of habit. — Sir Bulwer Lytton.

Eveiy hundred weight of bread contains eighty 
pounds of nutritious matter ; butcher's meat, ave- 
raging the various sorts, thirty-five ; French beans 
(in the grain), ninety-two ; broad beans, eighty- 
nine ; peas, ninety-three ; greens, eight ; turnips, 
eight ; carrots, fourteen ; and potatoes, twenty-five. 
One pound of good bread is equal to nearlj^ three 
pounds of potatoes ; and seventj^-five pounds of 
bread and thirty pounds of meat, are equal to three 
hundred pounds of potatoes. Or, to go more into 
detail, three quarters of a pound of bread, and five 
ounces of meat, are equal to three pounds of pota- 
toes; one pound of potatoes is equal to four pounds 
of cabbage and three of turnips ; but one pound of 
rice, broad beans, or French beans, is equal to three 
pounds of potatoes. 



COMPOSITION CAKE. 

418. One pound of flour, half a pound 
of butter, half a pound of sugar, seven

a pound of dried currants, half a pound of 
raisins, quarter of a pound of citron. Beat 
the butter and sugar together, beat the eggs 
well, and stir them into the butter and 
sugar; then add the flour and other in- 
gredients. The currants must be washed, 
picked, dried, and then slightly floured; 
the raisins must be picked and seeded, and 
slightly floured; and the citron should be 
shaved in very thin bits. This cake should 
be baked in a slow oven, or the fruit will 
scorch. 

It is told of the celebrated John Wilkes, that at 
some public meeting he sat next to a person, who, 
being displeased with the course matters were 
taking, kept exclaiming, " I cannot allow this to 
go on ! I must take the sense of the meeting on 
this point I" Whereupon Wilkes whispered to him, 
"Do so, if you will; I'll take the nonsense of the 
meeting against you, and can beat you I"

A CLERGYMAN who bought his sermoDs ready- 
written, instead of composing them himself, yet 
fondly believed his manuscripts peculiar to himself, 
was invited to preach in a church at some distance. 
Imagining that his sermon had created a sensation, 
he asked the sexton, after service, how it was liked. 
" Oh, ver}^ much indeed, sir," said the sexton, *'we 
always did like that sermon !"

It is said to have been satisfactorily demon- 
strated, that every time a wife scolds her husband, 
she adds a wrinkle to her face. It is thought the 
announcement of this fact will have a most satis- 
factory effect, especially as it is understood that 
every time a wife smiles on her husband, it will 
remove one of the old wrinkles I

of an inch thick, cut it in cakes, and bake 
on tins in a moderate oven. 

The first step toward wisdom, is to know that 
thou art ignorant ; and if thou wouldst not be 
esteemed foolish in the judgment of others, cast 
off the folly of being wise in thine own conceit. 



CREAM CAKE. 

423. Rub down five ounces of fresh 
butter into a pound of fine flour ; then mix

Some years ago a London chemist conceived the 
idea of collecting all the soapsuds of the metropo- 
lis, and recovering the soap that had been used 
in washing ; and could he only have organized a 
plan of collecting the suds, he would have suc- 
ceeded. An idea similar to this, has within the 
last few years been realized at Manchester, with 
the refuse of the factories. The invention has been 
patented, and an immense amount of waste tallow 
is thus recovered, which used to be washed into the 
Irish Channel, instead of returning to the purlieus 
of civilization, the wash-houses and bed-chambers, 
to wash the skins and the garments of the million. 
The Thames carries down manj^ thousand tons of 
good soap and candles, which would be much more 
useful to society, and more grateful to the senses, 
in that domestic form and character, than in those 
they now sustain in their voyage to the ocean. 
Some years ago a patent was taken out for a mode 
of recovering a large portion of this tallow ; but it 
has not yet been carried into practical operation.

A CUTTING REBUKE. — A clergyman had two 
daughters who were much too fond of dress, which 
was a great grief to him. He had often reproved

things, pride in dress. After speaking some con- 
siderable time on this subject, he suddenly stopped

We may arise in the morning with our hearts 
light and our spirits free, and before evening comes 
— nay, in one short hour, circumstances may occur 
which shall call for the exercise of no ordinary 
share of grace ; and unless we are on our guard, 
plunge us into guilt, and shame, and distress. In 
many a dismal story of private life we find that the 
sin which threw its chill withering shade, over all 
succeeding years — from which there was no refuge 
but through the darkness of the grave — was com- 
mitted without premeditation, without design, sim- 
ply by being "off one's guard." It is possible one 
hour to shudder at the thought of sin, and before 
that hour has passed away, to be the thing you 
shudder at.

gradually, only a small spoonful at a time, 
then stir in the almonds. Koll the paste 
into small balls, and place them on sheets 
of paper some distance apart. Place the 
sheets of paper on cake-tins, and put them 
in a cool oven.

of fine sifted sugar, and the whites of eight 
eggs, beaten to a solid froth. Roll the 
mixture into small balls, place them on a 
buttered tin, and bake them in a very 
gentle oven, about twenty minutes. Move 
them from the tin while they are warm, 
and store them in a very dry canister as 
soon as they are cold.

think music is the least disagreeable." 



SUGAR CAKE, 



443. Half a pound of butter, half a 
pound of sugar, one pound of flour, three

Gracious hearts reflect most upon themselves; 
they do not seek so much what to reprove in others, 
as what to amend in themselves ; they love to look 
inward — and being sensible of their own failings,

and put in the salaeratus and milk together, 
so as to form a dough. Knead it till it 
becomes perfectly smooth and light. Roll 
it in sheets about the eighth of an inch 
thick, cut the cakes with a cutter, or the top

James I. of England and YI. of Scotland was a 
waverer. He was aware of this defect, and heard 
of a preacher singularly happy in his choice of texts. 
James appointed him to preach before him, that he 
might put his abilities to the test. The preacher, 
with the utmost gravity, gave out the text in the 
following words : James the first and sixth, in the 
latter part of the verse : " He that wavereth is like 
a wave of the sea, driven by winds, and tossed." 
*' He is at me already," said the King.

half of sugar, and mix with a cup of sour 
milk, in which a teaspoonful of soda has 
been dissolved. ' To this add one egg well 
beaten. Bake in a mould or dish. It may 
be eaten hot, as a pudding, with sauce, or 
when cold, as cake. In the latter case use 
two eggs instead of one. 

A TEST OF COURAGE. — Henry lY. of France, read- 
ing an ostentatious inscription on the monument of 
a Spanish officer, " Here lies the body of Don, etc., 
etc., who never knew what fear was." "Then," 
said the kins, '' he never snuffed a candle with his 
fingers." 



RAILROAD CAKE. 

458. One cup of sugar, one cup of flour, 
three eggs, one teaspoonful of soda, and two 
of cream of tartar. Beat the sugar and 
yolks together. Whisk the whites to a 
froth, and add them with the flour. Mix 
the cre^m of tartar dry with the flour, and 
dissolve the soda in water or milk. 

The son of a small shopkeeper having put some 
candles in a cellar one day, his father told him he

thought it was too damp a place for them, and that 
they would be likely to mould, '* Likely to mould I" 
replied the lad ; " if that is the case, we had better 
put all our dips there, and perhaps they will turn 
to mould candles." 



CRULLERS. 

459. Four eggs, half a pound of sugar, 
three ounces of butter, one gillof thick 
cream, one teaspoon ful of cinnamon, and 
flour enough to form a dough. Roll it out, 
cut the dough into strips, twist them and

flour as possible, cut the dough in strips, 
twist them, and boil them in lard. 

A RETIRED cheesemonger, who hated any allusion 
to the business that had enriched him, said to 
Charles Lamb, in the course of a discussion on the 
Poor Laws — "You must bear in mind, sir, that I 
have got rid of that sort of stuff which you poets 
call ''milk of human kindness /^^ Lamb looked at 
him steadily, and gave acquiescence in these pithy 
words, " Yes, I am aware of that — you turned it all 
into cheese several years ago /" 



JENNY LIND CAKES.

one cup of sugar, three spoonfuls of sour 
milk, a little soda dissolved, and enough 
flour to make a stiff batter. 



COMMON PLUM CAKE. 



462. One pound and a half of flour, 
three ounces of butter, three ounces of 
sugar, three ounces of currants, and milk 
enough to form a dough. Add half a tea-

PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

CITRRANT JELLY, No. 1. 

464. Squeeze the juice out of the 
currants, which must have been picked on 
a dry day. Measure the juice, and to every 
pint weigh out a pound of sugar. Boil the 
juice twenty minutes, and skim it; then 
add the sugar, and fill your glasses. When 
cold, it will prove a fine jelly. 

The best cure for low spirits is business. One 
half of the melancholy that you run against is 
caused by indolence. The best fun in the world is 
activity. 



CURRANT JELLY, No. 2. 

465. Mash your fruit with a wooden 
spoon, and squeeze the juice through your 
jelly bag. To every pint of juice allow a 
pound of white sugar. When the sugar is 
dissolved, add a piece of isinglass, dissolved 



THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 40P 

in warm water, to clarify the jelly. A 
quarter of an ounce of isinglass to five pints 
of juice, will be sufficient. Boil and skim 
it till a jelly is formed; then take it ofi* 
the fire, and put it in glasses while warm. 
The next day put brandy paper over them, 
and paste them. Black currant jelly is 
made in the same way, only it requires 
but three quarters of a pound of sugar to 
a pint of juice. 



ORANGE JELLY. 



466. Squeeze the juice from the 
oranges, and to every pint of the juice 
add a pound of sugar and a quarter of an 
ounce of dissolved isinglass. The Kussian 
isinglass is the kind to use for this purpose. 
Boil and skim it till a jelly is formed, 
which you may tell by letting a drop fall in 
a glass of cold water — and if it falls to the 
bottom in a mass, the jelly is done. Or, 



410 THE YOUXG wife's COOK BOOK. 

take a little out in a spoon, and expose it 
to the cool air for a few minutes. 

See'st thou not that the angry man loseth his 
understanding ? Whilst thou art yet in thy senses, 
let the wrath of another be a lesson to thyself. 



GRAPES PRESERVED IN VINEGAR. 

467. Grapes are preserved in vinegar 
by the Persians after the following fashion. 
The grapes are gathered when half ripe, 
and put into bottles half filled with vinegar, 
which so macerates them, that they lose 
their hardness, and yet do not become too 
soft. The grapes have a sweet acid taste, 
which is not unpalatable, and especially 
refreshing during the great heats. 



CALVES' FEET FOR JELLIES. 

468. Always select those feet which 
have been dressed with the skins on — they 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 411 

will make a larger quantity of jelly, and 
better in quality, than those which have 
been skinned. Before cooking, the feet 
should be thoroughly scraped, washed, and 
soaked for an hour or two. 



A LADY thought it would look interesting to faint 
away at a party the other evening. One of the 
company began bathing her temples and head with 
rum, when the lady exclaimed, " For goodness' sake 
put nothing on that will change the color of my 
hairP^ 



ARROWROOT JELLY. 

469. Mix two tablespoonfuls of arrow- 
root with half a pint of water. Have ready 
half a pint of boiling water in which some 
lemon peel has been boiled. Take out the 
lemon, pour the dissolved arrowroot into 
the boiling water, add sufficient sugar to 
sweeten it, and nutmeg to the taste. Boil 
the whole about five minutes, and pour it 
in a mould or dish to get cold. It may be 
flavored with wine instead of the lemon. 



412 THE YOUNG T^^IFE's COOK BOOK. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

470. Peel the pears, and if they are 
large, cut each one in four pieces, and take 
out the core. To a pound of fruit, weigh a 
pound of sugar; dissolve the sugar with 
just enough water to wet it; add a quarter 
of an ounce of isinglass, dissolved in warm 
water, to five pounds of sugar. "When the 
sugar is dissolved, make the syrup, and cook 
the fruit until it is clear. 



PRESERVED GREEN GAGES. 

471. Prepare the fruit by pricking each 
one with a needle, to prevent them from 
bursting. Leave a portion of the stem on 
each, as it gives small fruits a handsome 
appearance on the table. Make a syrup 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, 
and a gill of water to a pound of sugar. 
Add a quarter of an ounce of isinglass, 
dissolved in warm water, to every six 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 413 

pounds of sugar. When the sugar is dis- 
solved, put it with the dissolved isinglass 
over the fire, boil, and skim it — then pour 
it out of the kettle. Wash the kettle, put 
the syrup back again, put in the fruit, and 
boil it till, by holding one toward the light, 
it looks clear. Take the gages c^t one at 
a time, strain the syrup, put the fruit in 
jars, and pour the syrup over warm. Paste 
them up the next day. 



PEACH MARMALADE. 



472. Pare and cut up the peaches in 
small pieces, and to a pound of fruit add a 
pound of sugar. When the sugar is dis- 
solved, set it over the fire, and let it boil 
till it is smooth paste. Stir it all the time 
it is boiling. Put it in the jars while warm, 
and paste them over the next day. 



414 THE YOUNG t\t:fe's cook book. 
RASPBERRY JAM. 

473. Take equal weights of fruit and 
moist sugar, and put on the fire together. 
Keep stirring and breaking the fruit till the 
sugar melts, then boil till it will jelly on a 
plate. Though simple, this will be found a 
very good receipt. Or, take equal weight 
of fruit and roughly-pounded loaf sugar; 
bruise the fruit with the back of a spoon, 
and boil them together for half an hour. 
If a little more juice is wanted, add the 
juice of currants, drawn as for jelly. 

Consumption of Agricultural Produce. — A 
human being (English) is supposed to consume 
annually the produce of rather more than three 
and one eighth acres of land — half an acre of 
bread ; one eighth for beer, cider, etc. ; one fiftieth 
for vegetables ; two and a half for animal food. 



PINE-APPLE MARMALADE. 

474. Pare the rind, and cut into small 
pieces ; the same weight of sugar as fruit ; 
put one third of the sugar to the fruit. Let 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 415 

it stand all night, so as to extract the juice. 
Boil it on the following day for a short 
time; let it stand for two or three days; 
then repeat the boiling, with another third 
of the sugar. Let it stand again another 
day or two, then boil it clear with the re- 
mainder of the sugar. The juice of a 
lemon, if added, gives to the marmalade an 
agreeable acid. 



BRANDY PEACHES. 

475. Select the white cling-stones, 
known by the name of the '^ Heath peach." 
Make a hot ley of ashes and water, put in a 
few peaches at a time, and let them remain 
about a minute and a half, or until the skin 
will rub off with your finger. Take them 
out, and throw them in a vessel of cold w^ater. 
When all are done in this manner, rub off 
the skins with a cloth, and throw them into 
another vessel of cold water. Make a syrup 
of half a pound of sugar to a pound of 



416 THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 

fruit — prepare it in the same manner as for 
preserves. Put in your peaches, and let 
them boil until they are sufficiently tender 
to be easily pierced with a straw. Take 
them out, and add to each pint of syrup a 
quart of the very best white brandy. When 
the fruit is cool, put it into your jars, and 
leave plenty of room to fill them with the 
syrup — as, if packed too closely, they lose 
their shape. 



APRICOTS IN BRANDY. 

476. Put apricots, whole, into a jar 
that has a close cover; add to them one 
fourth their weight of sugar, and brandy 
sufficient to cover them. Lay a piece of 
thick paper over the fruit in the jar; set 
the jar in a saucepan of cold water; put it 
over the fire, and when the brandy becomes 
hot, remove the jar. As soon as it is quite 
cool, cork, and seal securely. Do not let 
the brandy remain on the fire after it is hot. 



THE YOUXG wife's COOK BOOK. 417 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

477. Choose the white cling-stones, 

known by the name of the " Heath peach.'* 

Insert the knife at the stem and cut them 

longitudinally through to the stone. Wring 

out the stones, by placing one hand on each 

half of the peach, and suddenly givinp: each 

a turn in opposite directions ; the fruit will 

break in half, leaving the stone attached to 

one side. With a pointed knife it may 

easily be extracted. After the peaches have 

all been prepared in this manner, pare and 

weigh them. Then weigh a pound of sugar 

for each pound of fruit. Put the sugar into 

a preserving kettle, and allow a gill of water 

to each pound of sugar. Let the sugar 

stand until it is perfectly dissolved before it 

is put on the fire ; to ten pounds of sugar 

add the half of the white of an egg, well 

beaten, or a piece of Russian isinglass, about 

an inch square, dissolved in two tablespoon- 

fuls of water. Set the kettle over the fire, 
26 



418 THE TOUNG wife's COOK BOOK. 

and as soon as the syrup begins to boil, 
skim it. Wiien the scum has ceased to rise, 
take the syrup off the fire, pour it into a 
pan, and wash the kettle, in order to pre- 
vent the scum, which adheres to the sides, 
from boiling into the fruit. Now pour the 
syrup back into the kettle, add the fruit to 
it, and place it over a brisk fire, let the fruit 
boil fast for about an hour and a quarter, or 
until it appears translucent when held on a 
fork toward the light. Then take your 
peaches out very carefully, a piece at a time, 
and place them on dishes. Put the syrup 
in pans until it is lukewarm. Then put the 
fruit in jars, and pour the syrup over it. 



STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

478. Stem the strawberries, put them 
in a pan, and with a wooden spoon or 
potato masher, rub them fine. Put a 
sieve over a pan, and inside of the sieve, 



THE YOUNG "WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 419 

spread a piece of thin muslin ; strain the 
juice through this, and to a pint add one 
pound of sugar, with a quarter of an ounce 
of isinglass dissolved, in water to every five 
pounds of sugar. When the sugar is dis- 
solved, set the kettle over the fire and boil it 
till it is to a jelly. Pour it into glasses 
while it is warm, and paste them when 
cold. 

A GENTLEMAN having in his garden a superabun- 
dance of peaches that were over ripe, gave a quan- 
tity of them to some Irish laborers. On asking one 
of the men how he liked the fruit, he said they were 
very good, bat the seeds scratched his throat. 



RASPBERRY JELLY. 

479. Dissolve one ounce of gelatine in 
half a pint of water, add three quarters of a 
pint of raspberry syrup (with a spoonful of 
lemon juice, or fifteen grains of tartaric 
acid), boil and skim, and pour it into the 
mould. 



420 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

PUNCH JELLY. 

480. Take a pound of loaf sugar, one 
ounce and a half of isinglass, the juice 
of four Seville oranges four lemons, a 
wineglassful of brandy, and one of rum. 
Melt the isinglass in a pint or more of boil- 
ing water, then strain it quite hot through a 
fine sieve upon the punch. Stir it, and put 
it in a mould. 

Good temper is like a sunny day, it sheds a 
brightness over every thing ; it is the sweetener of 
toil, and the soother of disquietude. 



CALF'S FEET JELLY. 

481. Put a set of calf's feet, well cleaned, 
into a pan with five quarts of water, and let 
them boil gently till reduced to two quarts. 
Then take out the feet, let the jelly become 
quite cold, skim the fat off clean, and clear 
the jelly from the sediment. Beat the 
whites of eight eggs to a froth, then add one 



THE YOUNG ^IFE'S COOK BOOK. 421 

bottle of raisin wine or sherry, squeeze in 
the juice of from eight to twelve lemons, 
and the peel of five or six. Sweeten it to 
the taste (about two pounds and a quarter 
of loaf sugar). When the stock is boiling, 
take three spoonfuls of it, and keep stirring 
it with the wine and eggs, to prevent it 
from curdling ; then add a little more stock 
and still keep stirring, and then put it into 
the pan; let it boil twenty minutes, and 
about the middle of the time pour in half a 
teacup of cold water ; pour it into a flannel 
bag, and let it run into a basin. Keep 
pouring it back into the bag ge,Qtly till it 
runs clear. Let it settle a little, after boil- 
ing, before pouring it into the bag, and be 
nearly cold before going into the mould. 
The eggs and wine must be carefully mixed, 
or it will curdle. If loosening the edges 
and shaking the jellies or blancmange is not 
sufficient, try dipping the ^ mould for one 
instant into very hot water, or lay under 
it a cloth that has been dipped in hot water. 



422 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

JELLY WITH GELATINE. 

482. Take two ounces and three quar- 
ters of gelatine, dissolved in about a quart 
of water, four lenx)ns, one pound of loaf 
sugar, nearly half a bottle of raisin wine, or 
a little brandy and less of the wine, as little 
white of egg is necessary to clear it, as 
the egg takes from the stiffness of the jelly. 
Boil altogether, strain through a jelly bag, 
and put into a mould. 



APPLE JELLY. 



483. Quarter a peck of codlings, put 
them into a preserving-pan with the peel 
of a lemon, a small piece of cinnamon, and 
six cloves; add as much spring water as 
will just cover them. Boil the whole to a 
pulp, then run them through a jelly-bag, 
and to every pint of juice, put three-quarters 
of a pound of good loaf-sugar ; boil it fast 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 423 

until it jellies; then pour it into pots or 
moulds. August is the best time to make 
this jelly, when the codlings are full grown, 
but not ripe. Crabs greatly improve this 
jelly, and when they are not to be had, a 
little lemon juice. 

Jelly may be made of any kind of fruit 
by putting the fruit into a preserving-pan 
with its own weight of sugar, boiling and 
skimming it until it will jelly; then pour 
the whole through a jelly-bag, but do not 
press it ; take what remains in the bag, and 
boil it a quarter of an hour for jam, and put 
the juice into another stew-pan, and boil 
the same time. This method saves the 
trouble of pressing, and prevents waste. 



MARMALADE JELLY. 

484. To every pound of Seville oranges, 
put three pints of water, cut the oranges 
into quarters, keeping out all the seeds; 



424 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

separate the rind first, and steep it in water 
twenty-four hours, or even longer, to take 
off the bitter; then boil the peel slowly 
with the oranges, till it is tender; run all 
through a jelly-bag, and to every pint add 
one pound of loaf sugar, then boil it at 
least half an hour. A lemon or two, cut up 
with the oranges, is an improvement. The 
peel requires to be boiled some hours. 

"Mamma," said a little fellow, whose mother had 
forbade him to draw horses and ships on the 
mahogan}'- sideboard with a sharp nail, " mamma, 
this ain't a nice house. At Sam Rackett's we can 
cut the sofa, and pull out the hair, and ride the 
shovel and tongs over the carpet ; but here we can't 
have any fun at all 1" 



TO PRESERVE WHOLE OR HALF aUINCES. 

485. Into two quarts of boiling water, 
put a quantity of the fairest golden pippins, 
in slices not very thin, and not pared, but 
wiped clean. Boil them very quickly, 
close covered, till the water becomes a thick 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 425 

jelly; then scald the quinces. To every 
pmt of pippin jelly, put one pound of the 
finest sugar ; boil it, and skim it clear. Put 
those quinces that are to be done, whole 
into the syrup at once, and let it boil very 
fast; and those that are to be in halves by 
themselves ; skim it, and when the fruit is 
clear, put some of the syrup into a glass to 
try whether it jellies, before taking it off 
the fire. The quantity of quinces is to be 
one pound, to one pound of sugar, and one 
pound of jelly, already boiled with the 
sugar. 



TO KEEP ORANGES OR LEMONS FOR PASTRY. 

4-86. When you have squeezed the 
juice, throw the peels into salt and water; 
let them remain a fortnight ; clean out the 
pulp ; boil them till tender, strain them, and 
when they are tolerably dry, boil a small 
quantity of syrup of common loaf sugar and 



426 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

water, and put over them; in a week boil 
them gently in it, till they look clear. 

A cow consumes on an average one hundred 
pounds of green food in twenty-four hours. This, 
for one hundred and eight}' -five days of summer, is 
eighteen thousand five hundred pounds. In winter, 
fort3^-five pounds of roots a day ; or for one hundred 
and eighty days, eightj^-one hundred pounds. One- 
third of this may be potatoes ; the rest, other roots. 
But she gives, if well fed, two thousand quarts of 
milk a year. 



TO PRESERVE PEARS. 

487. Pare them very thin, and simmer 
in a thin syrup ; let them lie a day or two. 
Make the syrup richer, and simmer again, 
and repeat this till they are clear; then 
drain and dry them in the sun or a cool 
oven, a very little time. They may be 
kept in syrup, and dried as wanted, which 
makes them more moist and rich. Jargo- 
nelles are the best for this purpose. 

A YOUNG lady, after dancing all night, and several 
hours longer, will generally find, on consulting the 
looking-glass, that, the eve'ning^s amusement will not 
bear the morning^s reflection. 



THE YOUNG TVIFE'S COOK BOOK. 427 

TO PRESERVE A MELON. 

488. Scrape off the thin outside skin, 
make a hole in the top, take out the seeds ; 
then throw the melon into water, and after 
it has remained twelve hours, take it out 
and put it into a preserving-pan, with a 
large piece of loaf-sugar, and as much water 
as will cover it ; then cover the pan closely, 
and let it remain for an hour, on a very 
slow fire. Repeat this process three times, 
on three successive days, taking care not to 
allow it to boil ; make a thin syrup, drain 
the melon carefully out of the liquor, and 
put it into the syrup, set it over a slow fire, 
closely covered, for half an hour every day 
for three ensuing days, on the last day boil- 
ing the syrup until it is very rich, with the 
rind of one, and the juice of two lemons. 
To improve the flavor of a melon, take it 
when nearly ripe, cut out so much of the 
large end, as to permit the scooping out of 
the seeds; then fill up the hollow with 
water and sugar, or white wine ; close the 



428 THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 

top, put the melon in a net exposed to the 
sun, for as many days as it remains good. 
A loater melon will thus acquire a fine 
flavor ; but a mush melon requires no im- 
provement. 

Sink not beneath reverses. Play the game of 
life boldly. Here, at least, you may sometimes 
copy the gambler, who doubles his stakes as fast 
as he loses. 



TO PRESERVE NECTARINES. 

489. Split the fruit, take out the stones, 
and put the nectarines into clarified sugar 
till they take it well. Skim the liquor, 
cover the nectarines with paper, and set 
them by until the next day. Add sugar to 
the syrup, boiling it until it will flow ; put in 
the nectarines, give them a good boil, skim, 
cover them, and lay them on a stove. The 
next day take them out of the sugar, drain 
them, place them separately, dusting sugar 
over them ; the next day put them on the 
stove, or into a cool oven to dry. 



THE YOUXG wife's COOK BOOK. 429 

PICKLES, SAUCES, ETC. 

PICCALILLI, OR INDIAN PICKLE. 
490. Take white cabbage quartered, 
cauliflowers, cucumbers, melons, apples, 
French beans, plums ; all, or any of these ; 
lay them on a hair sieve, strew over a large 
handful of salt; set them in the sun for 
three or four days, or till very dry ; put 
them into a stone jar with the following 
pickle : Put a pound of ginger into salt and 
water, the next day scrape and slice it, salt 
it and dry it in the sun, put into a gallon 
of vinegar, w4th two ounces of pepper, half 
an ounce of turmeric, a quarter of a pound 
of mustard seed, bruised ; stop the pickle 
close, then prepare the cabbage, etc. If the 
fruit is put in, it must be green. The jar need 
never be emptied, but put in the things as 
they come into season, adding fresh vinegar. 

Those people who turn np their noses at the 
world, might do well to reflect that it is as good a 
world as they were ever in, and a much better one 
than they are likely ever to get into again. 



430 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 
PICKLED ONIONS. 

491. Choose small white onions, peel 
them, and throw a few at a time in a pan 
of boiling salt and water ; as soon as they 
look clear, take them out carefully, and 
place them on a sieve to dry, then put in 
more, and so on till all are cooked; when 
they are cold, put them in jars, and pour 
spiced vinegar over them. To each quart 
of the vinegar, put one tablespoonful of 
whole allspice, half a tablespoonful of pep- 
per grains, three or four small pieces of 
mace, half a dozen cloves, and a tablespoon- 
ful of mustard seed ; boil all these spices in 
the vinegar, and pour it, boiling hot, over 
the pickles. 

Oriental justice. — A person having a bag of coin 
stolen from his house, complained to the Cadi, who 
ordered all the people of the house before him. Giv- 
ing each a piece of stick, all of equal lengths, he 
said, "whoever is the thief, his stick will be a fin- 
ger's breadth longer than the rest." The thief, 
alarmed, cut a finger's breadth off his stick ; and 
next day, when they were summoned by the Cadi 
to produce their sticks, he was thus detected.

PICKLED RED CABBAGE. 

492. Choose two middling-sized, well 
colored, and firm cabbages, shred them very 
finely, first pulling oflf the outside leaves; 
mix with them half a pound of salt, tie 
them up in a thin cloth, and let them hang 
for twelve hours, then boil a quart of vine- 
gar, with an ounce of ginger, half an ounce 
of black pepper, and a quarter of an ounce 
of cloves. Put the cabbage into jars, and 
pour the vinegar over it when cold. 

The bright fire is the eye of the home ; it bespeaks 
cheerfulness, peace, cleanliness, comfort, about it 
the sweet courtesies of life, — in which there is no 
parade nor affectation, which manifest themselves 
in kind words and affectionate looks — cluster natu- 
rally and gracefully. 



CHOW CHOW. 



493. Three cabbages, twenty-five pep- 
pers, half a pint of mustard seed, three 
sticks of horseradish, chipped. Cut the cab- 
bages as for slaw ; chop the peppers very 



432 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

fine. Put in a jar, a layer of cabbage, a 
very little salt, then a layer of peppers, 
sprinkle over this some horseradish and 
mustard seed, and so on, till all is in, then 
fill up the jars with cold vinegar, in every 
quart of which dissolve two ounces of sugar. 
This is very good, with hot or cold meat. 

George I., on a journey to Hanover, stopped at a 
village in Holland, and while the horses were get- 
ting ready, he asked for two or three eggs, which 
were brought him, and charged two hundred florins. 
"How is this?" said his majesty, "eggs must be 
very scarce in the place." " Pardon me," said the 
host, " eggs are plenty enough, but kings are 
scarce." The king smiled and ordered the money 
to be paid. 



PICKLED TOMATOES. 

494. Take one peck of ripe tomatoes, 
prick them with a large needle, and lay 
them in strong salt and water eight days. 
Then take them out of the brine, and lay 
them in vinegar and water, for twenty-four 
hours. Scald a dozen small onions in vine- 
gar, and stand the whole away to get cold. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 438 

Drain the tomatoes, and add them to the 
cold onions and vinegar, with two wine- 
glasses of mustard seed, and an ounce of 
cloves. 

Force op habit. — Sir Walter Scott says : " There 
was a boy in my class at school, who stood always 
at the top ; nor could I with all my efforts supplant 
him. Day passed after day, and still he kept his 
place, do what I would. At length I observed that 
when a question was asked him, he alwaj^s fumbled 
with his fingers at a particular button in the lower 
part of his waistcoat. To remove that button, there- 
fore, became expedient in my eye ; and in an evil 
moment, it was cut off. Great was my anxiet}' to 
know the success of ni}'- measure ; and it succeeded 
onl}" too well. When the boy was again questioned, 
his fingers sought again for the button, but it was 
not to be found. In his distress he looked down for 
it ; it was to be seen no more than to be felt. He 
stood confounded, and 1 ''took him down." 



TOMATO CATSUP, No. 1. 

495. Cut the fruit in half, and boil it 
half an hour; squeeze out the juice and 
strain it through a hair sieve or coarse cloth, 
and add the spices in the proportion given 
below. Let the whole boil three hours,

434 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

over a slow fire. Pour it out, and let it 
stand till the next day, when you must add 
half a pint of vinegar for each peck of to- 
matoes. 

For each j^eck of tomatoes, one eighth of 
an ounce of red pepper, one quarter ounce 
of black, half ounce of mace, half ounce all- 
spice, half ounce cloves, two ounces mustard, 
all finely powdered. Salt to suit the taste. 

" Why is it, dear, that whenever we send for a 
pound of tea or coffee, the grocer always sends it an 
ounce short ?" " Oh, my dear, it's only o. peculiar 
weigh he has I" 



TOMATO CATSUP, No. 2. 

496. Slice the tomatoes, put a layer in 

a deep vessel, and sprinkle over some salt ; 
then another layer of tomatoes, and salt till 
all are in. Stand them in the sun for two 
or three days, when they are soft, pass 
them through a sieve, and put the pulp, 
thus drained out, over the fire to boil. Add 
Cayenne pepper, whole black pepper, mace. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 435 

cloves, allspice, and a little race ginger, if 
you like ; let it boil till it is thick, add a 
clove of garlic; by tasting it, you can judge 
if it is seasoned to your taste. When cold, 
bottle it off; put a tablespoonful of sweet oil 
on the top of each bottle, and seal the corks. 

A MATTER OP TASTE. — There is a charming tit-bit 
in the quaint history of " Hop o' my Thumb," which 
is not to be matched in literature of higher preten- 
sions. During the parley with the Ogre's wife, the 
hero says, as spokesman for his brother, " If you do 
not give us a night's lodging, it is quite certain that 
the wolves in the forest will devour us, and sooner 
tban that, we would prefer to be eaten by the gentle- 
man of the house,^^ 



PEPPER SAUCE. 



% 



497. Cut some green peppers very fine 
with double the quantity of cabbage, to a 
quart of the cut cabbage, and peppers, add 
a stick of horseradish grated, a tablespoon- 
ul of mustard seed, a tablespoonful of whole 
allspice, a dozen cloves, a couple of sprigs of 
mace, a tablespoonful of salt, and two of 



436 THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

sugar. Boil the spices and sugar, in three 
pints of good vinegar, and while hot, pour 
it over the peppers and cabbage. When 
cold, cover the jars, and keep in a cool, dry 
place. 



HORSERADISH SAUCE, No. 1. 

498. Grate a stick of horseradish. To 
one gill of vinegar, add a small tablespoon- 
ful of mustard, and the same of sugar, with 
a little salt. Mix them well together, and 
stir into the horseradish. 



HORSERADISH SAUCE, No. 2. 

499. Grate a stick of horseradish, add 
to it as much vinegar as will cover it, a lit# 
tie salt, and a teaspoonful of sugar.

VEGETABLE SAUCE, No. 1. 

500. Slice half a dozen large tomatoes, 
put them into a stew-pan, with about a pint 
of button mushrooms, and an onion minced 
fine. Season with Cayenne pepper and salt. 
Thicken with a piece of butter, rolled in 
flour. Stew very slowly. When the vege- 
tables are tender serve it. This sauce is 
good with cold meat. 



VEGETABLE SAUCE, No. 2. 

561. Peel a quart of mushrooms, put 
them into a stew-pan with the water which 
adheres to them. Season with salt and pep- 
per, stew them slowly, and when nearly 
done, add a piece of butter rolled in flour. 



POTATO SAUCE. 

V 

\ 502. Boil some potatoes till tender. 
Boil equal quantities of onions in another 



438 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

pot, when the latter are soft, drain them 
through a colander, mash them fine, season 
highly with pepper and salt. Add also a 
piece of butter. Then cut the potatoes in 
pieces about an inch square, add them to 
the onions, mix them well together; put 
them over the fire again a few minutes, to 
get hot, and pour in enough vinegar to 
flavor. Dish it up immediately, and serve 
hot. This sauce is an accompaniment to 
any kind of cold roast meat or poultry. 



TOMATO SAUCE. 

503. Peel some tomatoes and cut them 
in slices. Make a dressing of a tablespoon- 
ful of sweet oil, the same of vinegar, half a 
teaspoonful of mixed mustard, cayenne pep- 
per, and salt to the taste. Mix this dress- 
ing with the tomatoes and serve them. 
This is a good sauce for cold roast beef. 



THE YOTJNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 439 
ONION SAUCE. 

504. Peel some white onions, and boil 
them in milk and water, without salt. 
When soft, mash them, season them with 
pepper and salt, and add a piece of butter. 



MINT SAUCE. 



505. Pick and wash some spear mint, 
cho]D it fine, and pour on enough vinegar to 
wet it. To each gill of vinegar, add a 
quarter of a pound of sugar. Mix it well. 



CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

506. Pick and wash the cranberries, 
and allow three quarters of a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit. Put them in a pre- 
serving kettle with very little water. Stew 
them till they are soft, and pour them into 



440 THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

moulds. Einse the moulds in cold water to 
prevent them from sticking. 

The good are better made by ill, 
As odors crushed are sweeter still. 



APPLE SATJCE. 



507. Pare and slice some apples, put 
them in a stewpan with very little water, 
cover them to keep in the steam. When 
soft, mash them, and add sugar to the taste. 
Ripe quinces make a good sauce prepared in 
the same way as directed for apples. Or, 
apples and quinces may be mixed in equal 
proportions. 



DRIED APPLE SAUCE. 

508. Wash some dried apples, and pour 
over them enough hot water to cover them. 
Let them stand all night. In the morning 



THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 441 

put the apples and the water they were 
soaked in, into a kettle, and if there is not 
enough water to cook them, add some more. 
When quite soft, mash them. They are 
greatly improved by stewing some slices of 
lemon peel with them. They may be sea- 
soned with cinnamon or nutmeg. Sweeten 
to the taste. 



DRIED PEACH SAUCE. 



509. They are prepared in the same 
manner as dried apples. 



WINE SAUCE. 

510. Mix together two ounces of butter 
and a tablespoonful of flour; stir this into 
a half pint of boiling water, to which add 
enough sugar to make it quite sweet. Let 
it boil a few minutes, then add gradually 
the white of one eg^ beaten to a frothy and 



442 THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 

a gill of Madeira wine. Grate nutmeg over 
it, and serve it while hot. 



WHITE SAUCE FOR FISH. 

511. Boil a gill of new milk, beat the 
yolk of a fresh egg with half a gill of thick 
fresh cream. Add the milk slowly ; mix in 
by degrees the strained juice of a lemon. 
Stir over a slow fire till the sauce thickens ; 
then serve it at once. 

Good beef is easily distinguished by a practiced 
eye. It is of fine, smooth, open grain ; the color of 
the fat should be white, and the lean a bright red. 
If the color be dark and of a brick dust hue, and the 
fat hard and skinny, it will certainly be tough, and 
unwholesome, and dear at any price. 



LIVER SAUCE. 



512. Boil the livers of fowls a few min- 
utes in water ; rub them fine with part of 
the water in which they have been boiled ; 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 443 

season with pepper, salt, and some butter 
rolled in flour. As soon as the sauce comes 
to the boil, remove it from the fire. This 
sauce is good with cold roasted fowl or 
turkey. Serve it in a sauce tureen while 
hot. 

A PARTY, taking supper at a country tavern, found 
the poultry rather tough. One of the guests, after 
exercising hit ingenuit3" to no effect in trying to 
dissect an old fowl, turned to the waiter and asked, 
" Have you such a thing as a powder flask ?" "No, 
sir, we have not, do you want one ?" " Why, yes, I 
think the shortest way would be to blow this fellow 
up ./" 



PICKLED CHERRIES. . 

513. Pick over your cherries, remove 
all the specked ones. Put them into a jar, 
and pour over them as much hot vinegar 
and sugar as will cover them ; to each gallon 
of vinegar allow four pounds of sugar. Boil 
and skim it, and pour it hot over the fruit. 
Let it stand a week, then pour off the vine- 
gar and boil it as before, pour it hot over 



444 THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 

the cherries the second time. As soon as 
they are cold tie them closely. 



MANGOES. 

514. Although any melon may be used 
before it is quite ripe, yet there is a particu- 
lar sort for this purpose, which the garden- 
ers know, and should be mangoed soon after 
they are gathered. Cut a small piece out 
of one end, through that take out the seeds, 
and mix with them mustard-seed and shred 
garlic ; stuff the melon as full as the space 
will allow, and replace the cut piece. Bind 
it up with pack-thread. To allow for 
wasting, boil a good quantity of vinegar, 
with pepper, salt, ginger, and any of the 
sweet spices ; then pour it boiling hot over 
the mangoes for four successive days; and 
on the last, put flour of mustard and scraped 
horseradish into the vinegar, just as it boils 
up. Stop close. Observe that there be 
plenty of vinegar, as pickles are spoiled if 



THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 445 



not well covered. Large cucumbers, called 
" green turley," prepared in the same way, 
are excellent, and are sooner fit to be eaten. 



TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWERS. 

515. Cut them before they are too 
much blown, and upon a dry day ; strip off 
the leaves, and quarter the stalk; scald 
them in salt and water, but do not allow 
them to boil ; then lay them to cool, cover- 
ing them that they may not lose their color ; 
sprinkle them with salt and water; put 
them on a colander for twenty-four hours to 
drain. When dry, cut out the thick stalk, 
or, if it be large, divide it, give it a boil, 
and split the flower into eight or ten pieces; 
then put them carefully into jars, and cover 
them with cold vinegar, which has been 
previously boiled with spices ; or the cauli- 
flowers may have one boil in salt and 
vinegar, and be taken out immediately, and 
put into cold vinegar previously boiled with 



446 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

spices — two ounces each of coriander-seed 
and turmeric, one ounce each of mustard- 
seed and ginger, with half ounce each of 
mace and nutmeg, or cinnamon, to every 
three quarts of vinegar; the spices may, 
however, be varied. 

Brocoli and the tops of asparagus may be 
pickled in the same manner. 

A GENTLEMAN, on being asked what he had for 
dinner, replied, " A lean wife roasted, and the ruin 
of man for sauce." What did his dinner consist of? 
Of course you give it up, and here's the answer — a 
spare rib and apple-s>2i\XQ,Q. 



TO PICKLE TOMATOES. 

516. For this purpose the small round 
ones are the best, and each should be 
pricked with a fork, to allow some of the 
juice to exude, but keep it for the pickle. 
Put them into a deep earthen vessel, sprin- 
kle salt between every layer, and leave 
them there for three days covered ; then 
wash off the salt, and cover them with a 
pickle of cold vinegar, to which add the 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 447 

juice, mixed with a large handful of mus- 
tard-seed and one ounce each of cloves and 
white pepper, as being generally sufficient 
for one peck of fruit. It makes an excellent 
sauce for roast meat, and wdll be ready in 
about a fortnio;ht. 



PICKLED BEETS. 

517. Boil your beets till tender, but 

not quite soft. To four large beets, boil 

three eggs hard, remove the shells; when 

the beets are done, take off the skin by 

laying them for a few minutes in cold water 

and then stripping it off; slice them a 

quarter of an inch thick, put the eggs at 

the bottom, and then put in the beets with 

a little salt. Pour on cold vinegar enough to 

cover them. The eggs imbibe the color of 

the beets, and look beautiful on the table. 

There is a mistake, tho' the saying is old, 

To hear a man tell you he has a had cold ; 

We must drop the saying, though long it has stood, 

For I never heard of a cold that was good. 



448 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

TO PICKLE LEMONS. 

518. Take the finest with the thickest 
rind you can get, cut them deeply from end 
to end in more than one place, but not 
quite through, and fill the incisions with 
salt ; put each on end, and lay them in a 
dish near the fire, or in the sun if the 
weather be hot, to dissolve the salt, and 
repeat this during three weeks; then put 
them into a jar, with a handful of white 
mustard-seed if it be large, one-quarter to 
one-half pound of bruised ginger, half that 
quantity of cloves and allspice, a few chilis, 
and a very little turmeric ; boil in vinegar, 
and pour it upon the lemons when cold. It 
was originally prepared by the cook of the 
first Earl of Orford. 

Some people, however, add to it either 
shalot or garlic. It can hardly be ready 
in less than six months, but will keep for 
many years. 

For limes, or very small lemons, the same 



THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 449 

metliod must be pursued, only they will not 
require above half the time. 



CUCUMBEKS. 

519. If full-grown^ the small long sort 
are the best for pickling. Let them be 
fresh gathered; pull off the blossoms, but 
do not rub them ; ^owx over them a strong 
brine of salt and water boiling hot, cover 
them close, and let them stand all night. 
The next day stir them gently to take off 
the sand, drain them on a sieve, and dry 
them on a cloth ; make a pickle wdth the 
best white wine vinegar, ginger, pepper 
(long and round), and a little garlic. 
When the pickle boils, throw in the cu- 
cumbers, cover them, and make them boil 
ai5 quickly as possible for three or four 
minutes; put them into a jar with the 
vinegar, and cover them closely ; when 
cold, put in a sprig of dill, the seed down- 

23 



450 THE TOTTN-G WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

ward. They will be exceedingly crisp and 
green, done in this manner ; but if they do 
not appear to be of a fine color, boil up the 
pickle the next day, and pour it boiling on 
the cucumbers. 



TO PICKLE GHERKINS. 

520. Choose nice young ones, spread 
them on dishes, salt them, and let them lie 
a week, with a small bit of alum; then 
drain them, and putting them in a jar, 
pour boiling vinegar over them. Set them 
near the fire, covered with plenty of vine 
leaves ; if they do not become a tolerably 
good green, pour the vinegar into another 
jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when 
it becomes too hot to bear your hand, but 
still not to boil, pour it over them again, 
covering with fresh leaves ; and thus do till 
they are of as good a color as you wish. As 
an additional reason for preparing them at 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 451 

home, it is indeed well known that the 
very fine green , pickles are made so by 
the dealers using brass or bell-metal vessels, 
which, when vinegar is put into them, 
become highly poisonous. 

If spices be not mixed among the pickle, 
put into the kettle, in a thin muslin bag, 
allspice, mace, and mustard-seed, to every 
quart of vinegar in the proportion of rather 
less than half an ounce each of the former, 
to one ounce of the seed. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

CRANBERRY WATER. 

521. Pour boiling water upon bruised 
cranberries, let them stand for a few hours, 
strain off the liquor, and sweeten to the 
taste. This forms an agreeable and refresh- 
ing beverage for invalids. 



452 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
TO MAKE GETJEL. 

522. Ask those who are to eat it, if 
they like it thick or thin ; if the latter, mix 
well together, by degrees, in a pint basin, 
one tablespoonful of oatmeal, with three of 
cold water — if the former, use two table- 
spoonfuls. 

Have ready, in a stewpan, a pint of boil- 
ing water; pour this, by degrees, to the 
oatmeal you have mixed, return it into the 
stewpan, set it on the fire, and let it boil 
for five minutes, stirring it all the time to 
prevent the oatmeal from burning at the 
bottom of the stewpan, skim and strain it 
through a hair sieve. A little wine and 
nutmeg may be added. 



BALM TEA. 

523. Is made by simply pouring boil- 
ing water over some of the leaves in a 
teapot, and letting them infuse. 



THE YOUNG 'VTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 453 

APPLE WATER. 

524. Slice some apples, put them in a 
deep pan, and pour enough boiling water 
over them to cover them. Place the cover 
on the pan, and when cold, strain the liquid, 
sweeten it and flavor with a little lemon, if 
agreeable. 



BARLEY WATER. 

525* Wash two ounces of pearl barley 
thoroughly, and boil it for a few minutes in 
half a pint of water. Strain the water off 
and throw it away. Boil the barley in two 
quarts of fresh water until it is reduced to 
one quart; then strain it, and add sugar 
and lemon juice to the taste. 



BEEF TEA 



526. One pound of beef, one quart of 
cold water. Cut the beef in thin slices, and 



454 THE YOUNG TfIFE*S COOK BOOK. 

pour on the water. Cover it and set it in 
a warm place for three-quarters of an hour ; 
then put it over a slow fire where it will 
simmer for half an hour. Strain it, and 
serve it hot or cold as recommended by the 
physician. Salt it to the taste. 

When was beef tea first introduced into England? 
When Henry YIII. dissolved the papal bull. 



SLIPPERY-ELM TEA. 

527. Strip your slippery-elm into small 
pieces; take two tablespoonfuls of these 
pieces, and pour over them two teacups of 
boiling water. Let it stand until it be- 
comes mucilaginous, and then strain it. 



VEAL TEA. 

528. Cut one pound of a knuckle of 
veal in thin slices, pour over it a quart of 
cold water. Cover it, and let it simmer for 



THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 455 

an hour and a half. When boiled to a jelly 
it will keep for three or four days, and may 
be used at any time by pouring over it a 
little boiling water and letting it stand near 
the fire. Add salt to the taste. 



A Scotch minister was once ordered " beef tea " 
by his ph3^sician. The next day the patient com- 
plained that it had made him sick. " Why, minis- 
ter," said the doctor, " I'll try the tea mysel'." So, 
putting some in a skillet, he warmed it, tasted it, 
and told the minister it was excellent. '* Man," 
says the minister, "is that the way ye sup it?" 
*' What ither way should it be suppit ? It's excel- 
lent, I sa}^ minister." " It may be gude that way, 
doctor, but try it wi' the cream and sugar, man I try 
it wi' that, and then see hoo ye like it." 



IRISH MOSS OR CARRIGAN. 

529. Soak half an ounce of the moss in 
cold water for a few minutes ; then with- 
draw it, shaking the water from each sprig, 
and boil it in a quart of milk till it attains 
the consistence of jelly, and sweeten to the 
taste. A decoction of the same quantity 



456 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

of moss in a quart of water is also used as 
a demulcent in coughs. 

Neither let prosperit}^ put out the ej-es of cir- 
cumspection, nor abundance cut off tiie hands of 
frugaiit}^ ; he that too much indulges in the super- 
fluities of life, shall live to lament the want of its 
necessaries. 



ISINGLASS BLANCMANGE. 

530. Boil one ounce of isinglass in one 
quart of water till it is reduced to a pint ; 
then add the whites of four eggs, with two 
spoonfuls of water — to keep the eggs from 
poaching — and sugar enough to make it very 
sweet, and run the liquid through a jelly 
bag ; then put to it two ounces of sweet, 
and half an ounce of bitter almonds ; give 
them a scald in your jelly, and pass the 
whole mixture through a hair sieve, and 
empty it into a china bowl. The next day 
turn it out, and stick it all over with sweet 
almonds, blanched and cut lengthwise. 



THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 457 

BARLEY GRUEL. 

531. Wash two ounces of pearl barley, 
and boil it in a quart of water till reduced 
to a pint; strain it, and add sugar and wine 
to the taste. 



ACORN COFFEE. 

532. Peel the husks from sound ripe 
acorns, divide the kernels, dry them gradu- 
ally, and roast them in a close vessel ; 
while roasting they should be stirred con- 
tinually, and small pieces of butter added 
from time to time. Care must be taken 
not to burn, or roast them too much. 
When roasted, they may be ground and 
used as ordinary coffee. 



ALE POSSET. 

533. Boil a pint of new milk wnth a 
slice of toasted bread ; pour a bottle of mild 



458 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

ale into a punch bowl, sweeten and add 
spices, and then pour the boiling milk 
over it. 



BREAD PUDDING FOR INFANTS. 

534. Grate some stale bread into a tea- 
cup, pour boiling milk over it, and when 
cold, mix with the yolk of an egg. Boil it 
in a cup for a quarter of an hour. 



CELERY DRESSED AS SLAW. 

535. Cut the celery in pieces about a 
quarter of an inch long. Make a dressing 
of the yolks of three eggs boiled hard, half 
a gill of vinegar, half a gill of sweet oil, one 
teaspoonful of French mustard, or half a 
teaspoonful of common mustard, with salt 
and Cayenne pepper to the taste. Pour 
this mixture over the celery, stir it well 
and send it to the table. It should be 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 459 

kept in cold water to make it crisp, until 
about fifteen minutes before it is sent to 
the table, then drain it and pour the 
dressing over. 

" Let us endeavor that our life, though it be not 
of any great extent and length, yet may be of much 
weight and worth. Let us measure it by work, and 
not by time." 



ECONOMICAL USE OF NUTMEGS. 

536. If a person begins to grate a nut- 
meg from the stalk end, it will prove hol- 
low throughout ; whereas the same nutmeg 
grated from the other end, would prove solid 
to the last. This is because the centre con- 
sists of a number of fibres issuing from the 
stalk, and extending throughout the centre 
of the fruit. When the stalk is grated 
away, those fibres, being attached to no 
other part, lose their hold, and drop out, 
and a hollow is formed through the whole 
nut. 



460 THE YOUNG TTIFE's COGK BOOK. 
BREAKFAST DISH OF COLD MEAT. 

537. Cut the meat in pieces about an 
inch square, put them into a stewpan with 
some butter, or a little of the cold gravy. 
Season with pepper and salt. As soon as 
the meat is very hot, add a little flour to 
thicken the gravy, and serve. 

A FASTIDIOUS taste is like a squeamish appetite ; 
the one has its origin in some diseases of the mind, 
as the other has in some ailment of the stomach. 



CHEESE SOUFFLE, OR FONDU. 

538. Grate six ounces of rich cheese 
(Parmesan is the best) ; put it into an 
enamelled saucepan, with a teaspoonful of 
flour of mustard, a saltspoonful of white 
pepper, a grain of Cayenne, the sixth part 
of a nutmeg, grated, two ounces of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of baked flour, and a 
gill of new milk; stir it over a slow fire 
till it becomes like smooth thick cream (but 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 461 

it must not boil) ; add the well-beaten yolk 
of six eggs ; beat for ten minutes ; then 
add the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth ; pour the mixture into a tin, or 
a card-board mould, and bake in a quick 
oven for twenty minutes. Serve imme- 
diately. 

Human Pulsation. — An ingenious author asserts 
that the length of a man's life may be estimated by 
the number of pulsations he has strength to per- 
form. Thus, allowing seventy years for the com- 
mon age of man, and sixty pulses in a minute for 
the usual measure of pulses in a temperate person, 
the number of pulsations in his whole life would 
amount to 2,201,520,000 ; but if, b}^ intemperance or 
other causes, he forces his blood permanently into a 
more rapid movement, so as to give seventy- five 
pulses to the minute, the same number of pulses 
would be completed in fifty-six years ; consequently 
shortening his life by fourteen years. 



TO CLARIFY DRIPPING. 

539. Set it on the fire in a clean pan, 
and when melted and just going to boil, 
take it off and pour it into another pan half 



462 THE YOUNG TV^IFE's COOK BOOK. 

filled with boiling hot water ; stir the two 
well together with a broad, wooden spoon, 
and then remove the pan into a cool place 
till the next day, when the clarified drip- 
ping will be found floating on the surface 
of the water. 



CHICKEN JELLY. 

540. Take a large chicken, cut it up 
into very small pieces. Bruise the bones, 
and put the whole into a stone jar, with a 
cover that will make it water tight. Set 
the jar in a large kettle of boiling water, 
and keep it boiling for three hours. Then 
strain off the liquid, and season it slightly 
with salt, pepper, and mace ; or, with loaf 
sugar and lemon juice, according to the 
taste of the person for whom it is intended. 
Return the fragments of the chicken to the 
jar, and set it again in a kettle of boiling 
water. You will find that you can collect 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 463 

nearly as much jelly by the second boiling. 

This jelly may be made of an old fowl. 

Duke de Alba once replied to the king, who 
asked him whether he had seen the eclipse of the 
sun, that he had so much business to do upon earth, 
that he had no time to look up to heaven. 



GINGER BEER. 

541. One ounce and a half of ginger 
well bruised, one ounce of cream of tartar, 
one pound of loaf sugar, and one lemon, to 
every gallon of water. Put these ingredi- 
ents into an earthen pan, and pour upon 
them the water boiling. When cold, add 
a teaspoonful of yeast to each gallon. Let 
it stand twenty-four hours, then skim it. 
Bottle it, and keep it in a cool place before 
you drink it. 

''Xow, gentlemen," said a nobleman to his 
guests as the ladies left the room, "let us under- 
stand each other — are we to drink like men or like 
brutes ?" The guests, somewhat indignant, ex- 
claimed, "like men, of course." "Then," replied 
he, " we are going to get joll}' drunk, for brutes 
never drink more than they want." 



464 THE YOUNG ^IFE'S COOK BOOK. 
CHERRY ICE. 

542. Stone two pounds of ripe cherries, 
bruise and set them on the fire, with a little 
water, and a half pound of sugar ; when 
they have boiled, pass them through a hair 
sieve into an earthen pan ; pound a handful 
of the kernels, put them in a basin with 
the juice of two lemons, add to the cherries 
a pound of sugar, and strain on them the 
lemon juice and kernels; mix the whole 
together and put it into a freezer with 
pounded ice ; work the cherries up with 
it well until it has set, then place it in 
glasses. 



WATER ICES GENERALLY. 

543. If made from jams, you must rub 
them through a sieve, adding thick boiled 
syrup and lemon juice, and some jelly and 
coloring ; if for pink, add the white of an 
egg whipt up, before you add it to the best 
half of a pint of spring water; if of jam, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 465 

you must have a good pint of mixture in 
all, to make a quart mould ; if from fruits 
with syrup, you will not require water. 



PORTABLE LEMONADE. 

ft 

544. Take of tartaric acid, half an 
ounce ; loaf sugar, three ounces ; essence 
of lemon, half a drachm. Powder the 
tartaric acid and the sugar very fine in a 
marble or Wedgewood mortar (observe never 
to use a metal one), mix them together, 
and pour the essence of lemon upon them, 
by a few dropo at a time, stirring the mix- 
ture after each addition, till the whole is 
added ; then mix them thoroughly and 
divide it into twelve equal parts, w^rapping 
each up separately in a piece of white 
paper. When wanted for use, it is only 
necessary to dissolve it in a tumbler of cold 
water, and fine lemonade will be obtained, 
containing the flavor of the juice and peel 

of the lemon, and ready sweetened. 
29 



466 THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK 
BEER. 

545. To four gallons of water, take two 
pounds of sugar, one quart of molasses, 
half a teacupful of ginger, one pint of sots, 
two spoonfuls of cream of tartar, one and 
a half spoonfuls of ground allspice, and 
three drops of oil of sassafras. Put the 
spices into bags; heat the water and pour 
it over the spices ; mix the whole of the 
ingredients in an open vessel, let it stand 
over night, then skim off the top of the 
liquid, take out the bags of spices, and 
pour it carefully into jugs, bottles, or a 
keg; it will be fit for use in twenty-four 
hours. 



BUTTERED EGGS. 

546. Break four or five eggs carefully 
into separate cups ; put two ounces of good 
butter into a bright tin dish, and put it into 
the oven. When the butter boils, lay in 
the eggs carefully, and over each sprinkle 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 467 

white pepper and salt very lightly; put 
them in the oven for five or six minutes. 
Serve in the dish they are cooked in. 

" What is the reason your wife and you always 
disagree ?" asked one Irishman of another. " Be- 
cause we are both of one mind. She wants to be 
master, and so do I." 



MELTED BUTTER. 



547. This simple luxury, owing to 
ignorance or carelessness in making, is often 
any thing but a luxury. First, be particu- 
lar to have an exceedingly clean saucepan. 
Put into it in the proportions of a small 
teacupful of water, two ounces of butter 
and a large teaspoonful of flour. The flour 
should be mixed smoothly with the cold 
liquid before it is put near the fire, and 
if the mixture is allowed to stand an hour 
before melting so much the better ; but it 
must not be put 7iear the fire until it is 
ready to be melted. When once upon the 
fire, keep it stirred, or move it by occasion- 



468 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

ally shaking the saucepan ; but use the 
utmost caution to stir or shake it so that 
the liquid should always go around in the 
saucepan in the same way ; if it sometimes 
moves to the right and then to the left, it 
will be oiled, and then the best thing to do 
is to throw it away. A little cream or 
good milk may be used instead of part 
water, and will be found an improvement. 

A King's Speech. — Charles II., asked Bishop 
Stillingfleet, how it happened that he generally 
preached without a book, but always read the ser- 
mons which he delivered before the court. The 
bishop asked in turn why he read his speeches in 
parliament. " Why, Doctor," replied his merry 
majesty. " I'll tell you candidly ; I have asked 
them so often for money that I am ashamed to look 
them in the face." 



TO FRESHEN SALT BUTTER. 

548, Churn it afresh with new milk, 

in the proportion of a pound of butter to 

a quart of milk. 

Where is the hoe. Sambo?" " Wid de rake, 
massa." " Well, where is the rake ?" " Why, wid 
de hoe." "Well, w^ell, where are they both?" 
" Why, bote togedder, massa ; you 'pears to be berry 
'ticular dis mornin'." 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 469 

FOOD FOR DELICATE INFANTS. 

549. Take a piece of gelatin (or Ameri- 
can isinglass) about one inch square, dis- 
solve it in half a gill of water over the fire 
— then add a gill of milk. When it comes 
to a boil, stir in a good half teaspoonful 
of arrowroot. When taken off the fire, stir 
in two tablespoonfuls of cream. This food 
is suitable for a child four or five months 
old. As the child becomes older, increase 
the strength of the food. 

YicE AND Virtue. — Those who have resources 
within themselves, who can dare to live alone, want 
friends the least, but, at the same time, best know 
how to prize them the most. But no compan}'^ is 
far preferable to bad, because we are more apt to 
catch the vices of others than their virtues, as dis- 
ease is far more contagious than health. 



PRESERVING EGGS. 

550. The following receipt has been 
tried for several years with unvarying 
success. To five quarts of cold water add 



470 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

one pound of salt and one ounce of salt- 
petre; boil tegether for about twenty 
minutes, and when nearly cold, add four 
tablespoonfuls of pounded quick lime. Let 
it stand three days, stirring it twice a day. 
Place the eggs (which should be quite 
fresh) in a jar, with the small end down- 
ward, and pour the mixture upon them. 
Additional layers may be added, as conve- 
nient, and from thirty to fifty eggs may be 
done in one jar. They will keep for 
months, but must not be taken out of the 
lime till they are about to be used, when 
they will be found to be perfectly fresh. 
The lime should cover the eggs full two 
inches above them. 

Pleasant Travelling. — In Edinburgh resides 

Mr. C , who is as huge, though not as witty as 

Falstaff. It is his custom when he travels to book 
two places, and thus to secure half of the inside of 
the coach to himself. He sent his servant the other 
day to book him for Glasgow. The man returned 
with the following pleasing intelligence : " I've 
booked j^ou, sir ; but as there wern't two inside 
places left, I booked you one in and one out^ 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 471 
PLAIN OMELETTE. 

551. Beat four eggs very light. Have 
ready a pan of hot butter, pour the beaten 
eggs mto it, and fry it till it is of a fine 
brown on the under side, then lap one half 
over the other, and serve it hot. Just be- 
fore you lap it, sprinkle a little salt and 
pepper over the top. Chopped parsley or 
onion may be mixed with the egg before it 
is fried. 

A PERSON askino^ Dioo:enes what was the best din- 
ner-hour, he answered. "Any hour." "Nay," said 
the man, " any hour will not suit rich and poor too." 
"But it will, though," retorted the philosopher; 
" a rich man can dine any hour, that he likes ; but 
a poor man any hour that he can.^^ 



RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

552. Take ripe raspberries, put them 
in a pan, and mash them with a large 
wooden spoon or masher. Strain the juice 
through a jelly bag, and to each pint of 
juice, add one pound of loaf sugar, and one 



472 THE YOUNG "^IFe's COOK BOOK. 

quart of vinegar. When tlie sugar has dis- 
solved, place the whole over the fire in a 
preserving kettle, and let it boil a minute or 
two, and skim it. When cold, bottle it, 
cork it well, and it will be fit for use. 

A LAUNDRESS, wlio was employed in the family of 
a governor, said to him with a sigh. " Onlj^ think, 
your excellency, how small a sum of money would 
make me happy." " How little, madam ?" said the 
governor. "Oh! dear sir, twentj^ pounds would 
make me perfectly happy." "Then I will send it 
to you to-morrow ; upon the understanding that that 
amount will make 3'our happiness perfect." "I 
thank you, and assure you that it will," she said, 
and took her departure. She was no sooner outside 
the door than she thous^ht she mig^ht as well have 
asked and received forty ; so she stej^ped back, say- 
ing, "please make itfoiiy.^^ "Ah! I am released," 
said the governor, "you have proved tliat the 
twenty would not make 3^ou happy ; nor would any 
other sum." 



EESTORATIVE JELLY FOR INVALIDS. 

553. Take two ounces of isinglass ; one 
ounce of gum arable ; and one ounce of 
sugar candy. Put these into half a pint of 
spring water, and let them remain eight 
hours ; then simmer over a slow fire, or in a 



THE YOUNG TTIFe's COOK BOOK. 473 

jar in the oven, until dissolved. Add half 
a pint of good sherry; and, when nearly 
cold, flavor with'nutmeg or cloves. This is 
excellent. 

Teue wisdom is less presuming than folly ; the 
wise man doubteth often, and changeth his mind ; the 
fool is obstinate and doubteth not ; he knoweth all 
things but his own ignorance. 



TOASTED CHEESE. 



554. This preparation is popularly 
known as Welsh Rahhit or Rarehit. Cut 
some cheese into thin shavings, and put it 
with a bit of butter into a pan. Place it 
over a gentle fire, and stir it till the cheese 
dissolves. Serve it with toasted bread, in 
the bottom of the dish. 

" 'Tis being, and doing, and having, that make 
All the pleasures and pains, of which people par- 
take, 
To be what God pleases, to do a man's best. 
And to have a good heart, is the way to he blest. 



474 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

aiJEEN'S TOAST. 

555. Fry some slices of stale bread a 
fine brown ; then dip eachr slice quickly in 
some boiling water to remove the grease. 
Place them in layers on a dish. They may 
be put in the form of a pyramid. Serve 
with any kind of sweet sauce ; or they may 
be eaten with butter and sugar. 

A Turkish proverb runs thus : The devil 
tempts all, except idle men, and they tempt the 
devil. 



SANDWICHES. 



556. Cut the bread moderately thin, 
butter it very slightly indeed ; lay the meat 
cut thin, season with salt, pepper, and mus- 
tard, as may be required ; cover with a sec- 
ond slice of bread, trim the edges, put them 
one on the other, and cover with a damp 
cloth until required. Where tongue is used, 
it should be boiled the day before, and when 
thoroughly done pressed in a mould. Chicken 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 475 

boned and forced with a small quantity of 

forced veal and ham, and treated in the 

same way, will make excellent sandwiches. 

All kinds of meat used for sandwiches 

should be thoroughly done. 

Why should starvation be unknown in the desert ? 
Because of the sand-which-is there. But how came 
the sandwiches there ? Noah sent Ham, and his 
descendants bred and mustered. 



HAM SANDWICHES. 

557. Slice some cold boiled ham very 
thin, and spread over them a little French 
mustard. Place a slice of the ham between 
two thin slices of bread and butter. Or the 
ham may be laid on a very thin slice of but- 
tered bread ; roll it up, taking care not to 
break the crust. 



BLACKBERRY CORDIAL. 

558. To one quart of blackberry juice, 
add one pound of white sugar, half an ounce 



476 THE YOUNG "^Fe's COOK BOOK. 

of grated nutmeg, and half an ounce of 
pulverized cinnamon. Tie the spice in a 
fine muslin bag, boil the whole and skim it. 
When no more scum rises, set it away to get 
cold, and add one pint of best brandy. 
Cloves and allspice may be added in the 
proportion of a quarter of an ounce of each. 



COFFEE. 

559. Beat an egg, and to one teacupful 
of ground coffee, add one-third of the beaten 
egg, and as much cold water as will just 
moisten the coffee ; do not put in much cold 
water, stir all well together, put the mixture 
in your coffee pot, and pour over it six tea- 
cupfuls of hoiling water. Let it boil hard 
for ten or fifteen minutes. When it begins 
to boil, stir it frequently, and never leave it 
until the grounds sink, which they will do 
in a few minutes after it has been on the 
fire. Be careful and do not let your cofiee 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 477 

boil over, as by that means you lose a great 
deal of the grounds, and consequently the 
coffee will be weakened. Rinse your pot, 
if it be silver or Britannia metal, with hoil- 
ing water, pour the coffee into it, and serve 
it hot. Coffee and tea lose much of their 
flavor if served cold. 

My uncle P was an awfal snorer. He could 

be heard as far as a blacksmith's forge ; but my aunt 
became so accustomed to it, that it soothed her re- 
pose. The}^ were a very domestic couple — never 
slept far apart for many years. At length my uncle 
was required to leave home for some daj^s on busi- 
ness. The first night after his departure, my aunt 
never slept a wink ; she missed the snoring. The 
second night was passed in the same restless manner. 
She was getting in a ver}'' bad way, and probably 
it would have been serious, had it not been for the 
ingenuity of a servant girl ; she took the coffee mill 
into my aunVs hed-room, and ground her to sleep at 
once ! 



RAISIN WINE. 

560. Boil the water, which is to be 
used for the wine, and let it cool. Then 
put into a cask, eight pounds of raisins, for 
each gallon of water. Put the fruit and 



478 THE YOUNG WIFE S CX)OK BOOK. 

water into the cask alternately, until the 
cask is quite full. Lay the bung in lightly ; 
stir the wine every day or two. Keep the 
cask full by the addition of cold water 
which has been boiled. As soon as fermenta- 
tion ceases, put the bung in tightly, and 
leave the wine untouched for a year. Then 
draw it off in a clean cask, and fine it with 
a piece of isinglass tied in a muslin bag, 
and suspended in the liquor. The refuse 
raisins make good vinegar, if fresh water be 
poured over them, and the cask set in the 
sun. 

A WIT and a fool in company, are like a crab and " 
an oj^ster ; the one watches till the other opens his 
mouth, and then makes small work of him. 



GINGER WINE. 



561. To four gallons of water, put 
eight pounds of white sugar, and half a 
pound of bruised ginger. Boil the whole 
together, and pour the liquor in a vessel to 



THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 479 

cool. To each gallon, add the juice and 
rind of four lemons. Toast a piece of bread, 
cover it with fresh yeast, and put it in the 
liquor. As soon as it begins to ferment, 
put it into a cask. When the fermentation 
subsides, which will be in two or three 
weeks, add two pounds of raisins which 
have been stoned. In two months it may 
be bottled. 

Children and fools, says an old adage, always 
tell the truth. "Mother sent me," said a little girl, 
" to come and ask 3^011 to take tea with her this even- 
ing." " Did she say at what time, my dear ?" " No, 
ma'am, she only said she would ask you, and, then 
it would be off her mindy 



SAMP. 

562. This dish is made of new Indian 
corn crushed, but not ground. It should be 
boiled very slowly until quite soft, and sea- 
soned with a little salt. It may be eaten 
with sugar and good milk or cream, or with 
molasses. When cold it may be cut into 



480 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

slices and fried a nice brown. This latter 
dish is very appropriate for breakfast. 



MOCK OYSTERS, 

563. Boil some salsify, in water, with 
a little salt. When soft, mash it, and season 
it with pepper, salt, and a lump of butter. 
Have ready some bread crumbs or grated 
cracker, and a couple of eggs, well beaten. 
With a spoon, take out some of the salsify, 
dip it in the egg, and then in the cracker, 
and fry a light brown on both sides. 

A CLERK was assisting a clergyman, who had 
come to preach a charity sermon, to robe before the 
service commenced, when he said to him, " Please 
sir, I am deaf." " Indeed, m}'^ good man," said the 
clergyman, " then how do 3'ou manage to follow ine 
through the service ?" " Why, sir," said the clerk, 
*' I looks up, and when you shuts your mouth I 
opens mine." 



TO PRESERVE MILK. 



564. Take any quantity of really fresh 
milk, put it into a bottle well corked, and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 481 

plunge into boiling water for a quarter of 
an hour. 

Our attention has lately been directed to an in- 
vention for obtaining milk in a solidified form, for 
sea-voyages. A funny friend of ours, sa^-s it must 
be a capital invention, for solidified milk must ob- 
viously be ''quite the cheese.-'' 



TEA. 

565. Scald your teapot with boiling 
water, and allow a teaspoonful of tea for 
each person and one over. Pour enough 
boiling water on the tea leaves to rather 
more than wet them. Let it stand fifteen 
minutes ; pour on as much boiling water as 
will serve one cup to each one of the 
company. As soon as the first cups are 
poured out, add half a teaspoonful for each 
person, and pour on some boiling water. 
The most convenient article for hot water 
is an urn with a spirit lamp under it, which 
keeps it boiling on the table. But the 

30 



482 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

water may be kept sufficiently hot in an 
ordinary teapot. 

Some who are particular about their tea, 
stop the spout of the teapot with a cork 
while the tea is drawing:, to retain the 



'o> 



aroma. 



Tea came into general use sooner in England 
than in Scotland. In 1 685 the widow of the Duke 
of Monmouth sent a pound of it to one of her 
relations in Scotland. This Chinese production 
was then unknown. They examined it with great 
attention, and ordered the cook to come, who, after 
a long examination, decided that it was some dried 
herb. The}^ abandoned to him this precious eata- 
ble to use as he thought proper. Consequently he 
bad the leaves boiled, threw the water away, and 
ter>^ed them up like spinach. The guests did not 
finJ the garden stuff to their taste, and its reputa- 
t'-^n in Scotland thus suffered for a long time. 



THE BEST METHOD OF MAKING TEA. 

566. When tea is made out of the 
room, its volatile and essential proper- 
ties are frequently dissipated before it 
comes to the table. It is not the bitter- 
ness, but the fragrance of the tea that 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 483 

is refreshing. The tea should be wetted or 
steeped, before the larger quantity of water 
is added. But if the tea and the pot are 
both wanned dry, before any portion of the 
water is added, a stronger infusion will be 
obtained. Put the tea, dry, into the empty 
pot; then place the pot before the fire, or 
on the hot plate of an oven till the tea is 
well heated, but not burned; then pour 
upon it the boiling water, and a fragrant 
infusion will be immediately produced. 
Whether tea should be boiled or not, 
depends in some measure upon the constitu- 
tion and inclination of the consumer. If it 
is generally found to be too exciting, and if 
also a full and slightly bitter infusion is 
preferred, the tea should he toiled a few 
minutes, because boiling dissipates the vola- 
tile extract which disturbs the nervous 
system, and develops by solution the bitter 
principle. 

"Father," said a roguish boy, "I hope you 
won't buy any more gunpowder tea for mother." 



484 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK:. 

" Whj^ not ?" " Because every time she sits down 
to the tea-table, she blows us up /" " Go to bed, 
sir, immediately." 



RHUBARB WINE. 

567. Cut five pounds of rhubarb into 
small jDieces; add a gallon of cold water, 
and put it into a tub for eight or nine days, 
stirring it well two or three times a day. 
Strain the liquor, and to every gallon add 
four pounds of sugar, the juice and half the 
rind of a lemon ; put it in a cask, with half 
an ounce of isinglass dissolved in a little of 
the liquor. Add a gill of brandy. Bung 
the cask closely. Bottle it in ten or twelve 
months. 



A CHEAP SUMMER DRINK. 

568. Pour two bottles of porter into 
three quarts of water and one pint of the 
best molasses. Mix this well together, and 
in three or four days it will be fit for use. 



THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 485 
TO CURE HAMS. 

569. Mix together, eight pounds of 
salt, two ounces of saltpetre, two pounds of 
brown sugar, one ounce and a half of 
potash, and four gallons of water. This 
brine is suJSicient for every one hundred 
pounds of meat. The brine should be 
poured over the pork after it has laid in 
the tub for about two days. Let the hams 
remain in the brine six weeks, then dry 
them several days before smoking. The 
meat may be rubbed with fine salt when it 
is packed down. The meat should be 
thoroughly cool before packing. 

A PRUDENT man advised his drunken servant to 
put by his money for a rainy day. In a few weeks 
the master inquired how much of his wages he had 
saved. "Faith, none at all," said he, "it rained 
yesterday, and it all went." 



ANOTHER MODE OF CURING HAMS. 

570, To every hundred pounds of pork, 
take a bushel and half a peck of salt, three 



486 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

pounds of saltpetre, three pounds of sugar, 
and two quarts of molasses. Mix these 
ingredients, and rub the meat with it well. 
At the end of nine days, take out the hams 
and put those which were at the top at the 
bottom. In three weeks, take out the meat. 
Remember to rub the hams often with the 
salt, etc., while it is in the tub, so that 
every part may be thoroughly impregnated. 

"What makes 3- ou get up so late, sir?" said a 
father to his son, who made his appearance at the 
breakfast table about ten o' clock. " Late ! why 
father I was up with the lark." "Well, then, sir, 
for the future don't remain so long up with the 
lark, but come down a little earlier to breakfast." 



COLD MEAT, GAME OR POULTRY, DRESSED 
AS FRITTERS. 

571. Weigh the meat, and put an equal 
weight of bread crumbs to soak in cold 
water; let there be a little fat with the 
meat, and cut it into small dice. Squeeze 
the water from the bread ; put in the pan 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 487 

two ounces of butter or lard, and two table- 
spoonfuls of onion, chopped fine; fry two 
minutes, then add the bread, stir with a 
wooden spoon until rather dry ; then add 
the meat ; season with salt and pepper to 
taste, add a little nutmeg, if approved ; stir 
till quite hot ; then add gradually two eggs 
well beaten ; mix quickly, and pour on a 
dish to cool. Roll into the shape of small 
eggs, egg and bread crumb them, and fry. 
Serve plain with any appropriate sauce. 

What wind does a hungry sailor like best ? One 
that blows foul, afterward chops, and then comes 
with little puffs. 



BOILED TRIPE. 



572. Scrape and wash the tripe very 
clean, boil it in water with salt enough to 
season the tripe ; when very tender, have 
ready some onions, boiled and washed, and 
well seasoned with pepper, salt, and a lump 
of butter ; put the onions in a deep dish, 



488 THE YOUNG ATIFe's COOK BOOK. 

and lay the tripe on the top, or serve them 
in separate dishes. 

Some persons like tripe boiled plainly in 
water, and served with onion sauce and 
mustard. 

Virtue comes from industry quite as ranch as from 
morality. "An idle head is Satan's workshop •/' 
and let a raan do nothing for a fortnight, the old 
adversary will get possession ot his pate, bring in 
a stock of evil thoughts, start the machinery of 
low passions, and commence his regular business 
of producing sin. 



FRIEB TRIPE. 

573. Tripe may be fried in egg and 
bread crumbs like ovsters, and is then a 
very nice dish ; it should first be boiled till 
tender ; it may be fried without the <^%^ or 
crumbs, in gravy, thiekened with a little 
flour, and flavored with catchup or vinegar.

AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR PASTRY 
FOR THE DYSPEPTIC. 

574. Boil a teacupful of sago as tliick 
as it can be made to boil, without burning ; 
put about five spoonfuls into a quart basin ; 
then a layer of baked fruit of any sort, 
sweetened, and fill the basin to the brim 
with alternate layers of fruit and sago. Set 
in a cool place for a little time, and it will 
become solid. It is best when made shortly 
after breakfast, and allowed to stand till 
wanted, to warm either in an oven, over 
boiling water, or before the fire, with a plate 
turned over it, for dinner. The sago boils 
best when soaked in cold water for a few 
hours before using. Rice may be used in 
the same way. Serve with any sweet sauce. 



TO KEEP CHESTNUTS. 

575. To preserve chestnuts, in order 
to have them good and fresh, to eat through

the winter, you must make them perfectly 
dry after they have come out of their green 
husks ; then put them into a box or barrel, 
mixed with, and covered over by fine and 
dry sand, three gallons of sand, to one gal- 
lon of chestnuts. If there be maggots in 
any of the chestnuts, they will come out 
of the chestnuts, and work up through the 
sand to get to the air ; and thus you have 
your chestnuts sweet, sound, and fresh. 

Have you ever watched an icicle as it formed ? 
You noticed how it froze one drop at a time. If 
the water was clean, the icicle remained clear, and 
sparkled in the sun ; but if the water was slightly 
muddy, the icicle looked foul, and its beauty was 
spoiled. Just so our characters are forming. One 
little thought or feeling at a time, adds its influence. 
If every thought be pure, the soul will be lovely, 
and will sparkle with happiness ; but if impure, 
there will always be wretchedness. 



CELERY FOR FLAVORING. 

76. Celery leaves, and ends, are used 
for flavoring soups, gravies, sauces, etc. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 491 
TO COLOR BUTTEE. 

577. For every four quarts of cream, 
grate one middling sized carrot, pour on it 
half a pint of boiling water, let it stand 
until cool, and strain the liquor into the 
cream. It does not hurt the flavor. 

How few do eat and drink, not merely with an in- 
tention to preserve the body in health and strength, 
but with such prudence, care and caution, as not to 
over cherish and pamper, to embolden and enlarge 
their bodies. 



ESSENCE OP CELERY. 



578. Soak a tablespoonful of celery 
seeds, in a large teacupful of brandy. A 
fevp- drops will suffice to flavor a quart of 
soup. 

The thieving propensities of "the cat" are well

ELDERBERRY WINE. 

579. To ten quarts of berries, put five 
quarts of water, and let it stand twenty- 
four hours. Then boil and skim it ; strain 
it, and to every gallon of the liquor put 
three pounds of sugar, half an ounce of 
cloves, one ounce of cinnamon, and two 
ounces of ginger. Boil it again, and fer- 
ment it, by putting in it a slice of toast 
covered with fresh yeast. By leaving out 
the spices, this wine is said to resemble 
Port. 

At a hotel at Hastings, Jerrold was dining with 
two friends, one of whom, after dinner, ordered, 
among other pleasant things, " a bottle of old port." 
"Waiter," said Douglas, with that twinkle of the 
eye, that was always a promise of wit, " Mind, now, 
a bottle of your old port, not your elder port." 



PATTIES OF FRIED BREAD. 

580. Cut the crumb of a loaf, into 
square or round pieces, nearly three inches 
high, and cut bits, the same width for tops ; 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 493 

mark them neatly with a knife; fry the 
bread of a Hght brown color, in fine lard. 
Scoop out the inside crumb, taking care not 
to go too near the bottom; fill the space 
with meat ; put on the tops, and serve. 

A SAILOR went to a conjuror's exhibition. There 
were to be fireworks at the conclusion ; but they 
accidentally exploded and blew up the room. The 
sailor fell in a potato field, just outside, unhurt ; he 
got up, and shook himself, and walked back toward 
the room, exclaiming, " Confound the fellow, / won- 
der what he will do next P' 



MOLASSES CANDY. 

581. One quart of West India molasses, 
half a pound of brown sugar, the juice of 
one lemon. Put the molasses in a kettle 
with the sugar, boil it over a slow, steady 
fire, till it is done, which you can easily tell 
by dropping a little in cold water ; if done, 
it will be crisp, if not, it will be stringy. A 
good way to judge if it is boiled enough, is 
to let it boil, till it stops bubbling. Stir it 



494 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

very frequently, and just before it is taken 
off the fire, add the lemon juice. Butter a 
shallow tin pan, and pour it in to get cold. 
Molasses candy may be flavored with any 
thing you choose. Some flavor with lemon, 
and add roasted ground-nuts, or almonds 
blanched. 

'Tis good advice that St. Jerome gives ; still be 
doing some warrantable work, that the devil may 
always find thee well employed. 



CHEESE TOASTED. 

582. This preparation is popularly 
known as Welsh rabbit or rarebit. Cut 
some cheese into thin shavings, and put it 
with a bit of butter, into a cheese toaster ; 
place it before the fire, until the cheese dis- 
solves, stirring it occasionally. Serve with 
a slice of toasted bread, the crust pared off. 

Two city ladies meeting at a visit, one of them a 
grocer's wife, and the other a cheesemonger's (who 
perhaps stood more upon the punctilio of prece- 
dence, than some of their betters would have done 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 495 

at the court end of the town), when they had risen 
up and took their leaves, the cheesemonger's wife 
was going out of the room first, upon which the 
grocer's lady, pulling her back by the tail of her 
gown, and stepping before her, "No, madam," said 
she, " nothinor comes after cheese." 



GOOSEBERRY CHAMPAGNE. 

583. Select large full grown berries, 
before they begin to turn red. Allow a gal- 
lon of water to every three pounds of fruit. 
Put the berries in a clean tub, pour on a 
little water, pound and mash the fruit ; then 
add the remainder of the water, and stir the 
whole well. Cover the tub with a clean 
cloth, and let it stand four days. Stir it 
frequently and thoroughly ; then strain the 
liquid through a jelly bag, or coarse linen 
cloth, and to each gallon, add four pounds of 
white sugar, and to every five gallons, one 
quart of the best French brandy. Mix the 
whole, and put it into a clean cask that will 
just hold it, as the cask should be full. 



496 THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 

Place the cask in a cool dry place, and lay 
the bung in loosely. Secure the cask firmly, 
SO that it cannot be shaken or moved, as 
the least disturbance will injure the wine. 
Let it work for two weeks, or more, until 
the fermentation is subsided. Then bottle 
it, and be careful to drive the corks in 
tightly. Lay the bottles on their sides, and 
in six months, the wine will be fit for use. 



TO MAKE COTTAGE BEER. 

584. Take a quarter of a peck of good 
white bran, and put it into ten gallons of 
water, with three handfuls of hops, boil the 
whole together until the bran and the hops 
sink to the bottom. Then strain it through 
a hair sieve into a cooler, and when it is 
about lukewarm, add two quarts of molasses. 
As soon as the molasses is thoroughly in- 
corporated, pour the whole into a nine gal- 
lon cask, with two tablespoonfuls of yeast. 



THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 497 

When the fermentation has subsided, bung 
up the cask, and in four days it will be fit 
for use. Table beer, if drawn off into stone 
jars, wath a lump of white sugar in each, 
and securely corked, will keep good for 
several months. 

"This is capital ale — see how long it keeps its 
head !" " Aye, but consider how soon it takes away 
yours.^^ 



TO MAKE PERRY. 

585. Let the pears be sweet and per- 
fectly ripe, but take care that the cores 
have not become rotten ; take them to the 
press or mill, and squeeze out the juice, 
from whence the liquor is removed to casks, 
which must stand in the open air, in a very 
cool place, with the bung-holes open. The 
fermentation is accomplished by mixing a 
pint of new yeast with a little honey and 
flour warmed, and the whites of four eggs. 
Put this in a bag of thin muslin, drop it ia

498 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOIC BOOK. 

the cask, and suspend it from the bung-hole 
by a string, taking care that it does not 
touch the bottom of the vessel. If it works 
well, the liquor will have cleared itself in 
^ve or six days, and may be drawn off from 
the lees into smaller casks, or bottled. In 
winter. Perry requires to be kept warm, 
and free from frosts or draughts of air. In 
summer, the vesssels or bottles containing it 
must be moved to a cool place, otherwise 
they will burst. 

A MAN praising Perry, said it was so excellent a 
beverage, that in great quantities it alwa3^s made 
him fat. " I have seen the time,'- said another, 
"■when it made j-ou lean." "When?" asked the 
eulogist. " Last night — against a walV^ 



SPRUCE BEER. 



586. Pour eight gallons of cold water 
into a barrel ; to this add eight gallons of 
boiling water ; then put in six tablespoonfuls 
of essence of spruce, and sixteen pounds of 
inolasses. When sufficiently cold, add half 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 499 

li pint of yeast, and roll the cask about, or 
shake it well. Keep it in a warm place for 
two days, with the bung open ; by this time 
the fermentation will have subsided suffi- 
ciently for bottling. Bottle it, or*put it in 
stone jars well corked, and it will be fit for 
use in a week. 

A GENTLEMAN who had put aside two bottles of 
choice ale, discovered, just before dinner, that his 
servant had emptied them both. " Scoundrel 1" ex- 
claimed the master, " what do you mean by this?'^ 
" Why, sir, I saw plainly enough by the clouds that 
it was going to thunder, so I drank it, to prevent 
its turning sour — there's nothing I abominate, like 
waste I" 



THE BEST GINGER BEER, 

587. White sugar, twenty pounds; 
lemon or lime juice, eighteen ounces ; honey, 
one pound; white ginger, bruised, twenty- 
two ounces; water, eighteen gallons. Boil 
the bruised ginger in three gallons of water 
for half an hour ; then add the sugar, the 
juice, and the honey with the remainder 



500 THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of the water. Boil and strain. When cold, 
add the white of an egg, and half an ounce 
of essence of lemon. Allow it to ferment 
in the usual way. Then in about four days 
bottle it, and it will keep for months. 
Smaller quantities may be made by redu- 
cing the ingredients in equal proportions. 

A TOPER, being on a visit to a neighboring 
squire, when a very small glass was set before him 
after dinner, pulled the servant by the tail of his 
coat, and expostulated with him. " What is this 
glass for ? Does your master intend to keep me 
here all night P^ 



CHERRY BOUNCE. 

588. To fifteen pounds of morella cher- 
ries, add one gallon of the best French 
brandy or good Monongahela whisky. Let 
them stand for three or four months, then 
pour off the liquor, and add to the cherries 
two quarts of water, which should remain 
on them three weeks ; pour off the water 



THE TOUKG TTTFE'S COOK BOOK. 501 

and add it to the liquor ; to all of which 
add four pounds of sugar made into a syrup. 

Beware of such food as persuades a man, though 
he be not hungry, to eat ; and those liquors that 
prevail with a man to drink them when he is not 
thirsty. 



SAVORY MACARONI. 

(NAPLES RECEIPT.) 



589. Blanch ^ix ounces of Naples 
macaroni in two quarts of boiling water, 
with a tablespoonful of salt in it; let it 
remain till cold, then drain on a sieve. Put 
it into an enamelled saucepan with two 
ounces of butter, and stir over the fire till 
the butter is absorbed ; then add a quart of 
new milk and simmer very gently till quite 
tender (about an hour and a half); add 
a teaspoonful of flour of mustard, a salt- 
spoonful of white pepper, the sixth part of a 
nutmeg, grated, a grain of Cayenne, three 
ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, and two 
fresh eggs, beaten with a gill of thick cream ; 



502 THE YOUNG TTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

place it on a dish and sift grated Parmesan 
cheese thickly over (three ounces) ; on that 
lay an ounce of butter, in small pieces ; 
bake in a quick oven, or before the fire, till 
of a pale brown color, from twelve to fifteen 
minutes. Serve very hot. 

At Gibraltar there was a great scarcity of water, 
and a general complaint of the want of it. An 
Irish officer said, " He was veiy easy about the 
matter, for he had nothing to do with water ; if he 
only got his tea in the morning, and punch at 
night, it was all that he wanted." 



DRESSING FOR COLD SLATJ. 

590. Beat up two eggs ; add to it one 
gill of vinegar and water, mixed ; place it 
on the range ; when it begins to thicken, 
stir in a piece of butter the size of a small 
walnut, a little salt, and a teaspoonful of 
sugar. When cold, pour it over the cab- 
bage ; stir it together, and before sending to 
table sprinkle with a little black pepper. 

One of the very best of all earthly possessions is 
self-possession. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 503 

CHEESE SANDWICHES. 

591. Take two parts of grated Parme- 
san cheese, one of butter, and a small pro- 
portion of made mustard ; pound them in a 
mortar ; cover slices of bread with a little 
of this, and lay over it slices of ham or any 
cured meat; cover with another slice of 
bread, press them together and cut into 
mouthfuls, that they may be lifted with a 
fork. 

Why can't the captain of a vessel keep a memo- 
randum of the weight of his anchor, instead of 
weighing it every time he leaves port. 



LEMON SHERBERT. 



592. Squeeze the juice out of six 
lemons, and take out all the pulp ; then 
pour two quarts of boiling milk and ten 
heaping tablespoonfuls of sifted sugar over 
the skins, and cover the whole very tightly. 
When cold, strain out the peel, pour the 



504 THE YOUNG wife's COOK BOOK. 

milk into the freezer, and when half frozen, 
add the lemon juice ; stir it well, and let it 
freeze. 

Ice in India. — The method adopted by the In- 
dians to obtain ice, is very ingenious. They dig 
pits in the ground about two feet deep, which they 
line with dried sugar canes or Indian corn. On 
this they place very shallow dishes, made of un- 
glazed and porous earthenware, and filled with soft 
Waaler that has been boiled. Thus they are de- 
posited in the evenir^g, and in consequence of the 
evaporation from the outside of the dishes, a con- 
siderable portion of the water is found frozen next 
morning. The ice is collected before sunrise, and 
rammed into a cellar under ground, and lined with 
straw, where, owing to the accumulated cold, the 
ice freezes into a solid mass. 



PUNCH. 

593. Four pounds of sugar, one pint of 
lemon juice, one pint of Jamaica spirits, 
half a pint of peach brandy, half a pint of 
French brandy, five quarts of water. The 
quantity of liquor may be regulated accord- 
ing to the taste. 

A TOPER was asked what he thought of the 
effects of strong drink upon the system. "Hot 



THE YOUNG ^VIFE's COOK BOOK. 505 

drinks," he replied, "are bad, decidedly bad. Tea 
and coffee, for instance, undoubtedly hurtful; and 
even hot punch, when very hot, and taken in too 
large quantities, if that be possible, might ulti- 
mately do harm I" 



SNOW PANCAKES AND PTJDDINGS.-THE COST 
OF EGGS SAVED IN THE DEAREST SEASON. 

594-. It is not generally known that 
snow is a good substitute for egg, in both 
puddings and pancakes. Two tablespoon- 
fuls may be taken as the equivalent of an 
eg^. Take it from a clean spot, and the 
sooner it is used after it is taken in-doors 
the better. It is to be beaten in, just as 
eggs are, and should be handled as little as 
possible. As eggs are dear in the season of 
snow, it is a help to economy to know the 
above. It is equivalent to a supply of fresh 
eggs. Powdered ice will answer as well as 
snow, when the latter cannot be obtained. 

" You can do any thing if you will only have pa- 
tience," said an old uncle who had made a fortune, 
to a nephew who had nearly spent one. " Water

" How long ?" asked the petulant spendthrift, who 
was impatient for the old man's obituary. His uncle 
coolly replied, ''Till it freezes P^ 



USE OF BONES IN COOKING. 

595, Crack the bones very small, and 
boil them in plenty of water for two or 
three hours, according to the quantity of 
bones. When the water is half boiled 
away, a very nutritious jelly will be ob- 
tained. Iron or porcelain lined vessels are 
the only proper kinds for this purpose. This 
jelly may be added to soup or gravy. 

Eyes dry for their sins, are vainly wet for their 
sufferings ; a drought in the spring is not to be re- 
paired by a deluge in the autumn. 



HOME-MADE CAYENNE PEPPER. 

596. RermDve the stalks of Chili pep- 
pers, and put the pods into a colander ; set it 
before the fire for about twelve hours, by 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 507 

which time they will be dry. Then pour 
them into a mortar, with one fourth their 
weight in salt, and pound and rub them till 
they are as fine as possible, sift through a 
little muslin, and then pound the residue, 
and sift again. 

A farmer's wife lately entered a druggist's shop, 
and handed him two prescriptions to be prepared, 
one for her husband and the other for her cow. 
Finding, however, that she had not sufficient cash 
to pay for both, she took away that for the cow, 
saying, '^To-morrow will do for my husband.^^ 



MAYONNAISE. 



597. Put into a large basin the yolks 
of two new laid eggs, with a little salt and 
Cayenne ; stir these well together, then add 
a teaspoonful of good salad oil, and work 
the mixture round until it appears like 
cream. Pour in, by slow degrees, nearly 
half pint of oil, continuing at each interval 
to work the sauce as at first, until it re- 
sumes the smoothness of cream, and not a 



508 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

particle of the oil remains visible ; then add 
two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, and 
one tablespoonful of cold water to whiten 
the sauce. 

Paddy, one day, being sent to count some pigs 
(the number being twenty), was asked by his mas- 
ter whether they were all right. He said, " Faith, 
and I counted nineteen, but one little beggar ran 
about so fast, I could not count him at all." 



A CHEAP METHOD OF OBTAINING A CON- 
STANT SUPPLY OF PURE VINEGAR. 

598. Take one gallon of water, half a 
pound of sugar, half a pound of molasses, 
and boil them together for twenty minutes ; 
when cool, add a teacupful of yeast; put 
the whole into a jar, and lay a vinegar 
plant on the surface of the liquor. Cover 
the jar with paper, keeping it in a warm 
place, and it will produce very good and 
wholesome vinegar in about six weeks. 

The vinegar plant is a minute fungus, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK, 509 

forming what is commonly called '' the 
mother of vinegar." A bit of this thrown 
into the above liquid rapidly increases, and 
changes the sugar and water into vinegar. 
The plant will form of itself in the first in- 
stance, but this will require a longer time. 
Afterward it may be divided and trans- 
ferred to other quantities of the mixture, to 
accelerate the process of vinegar making. 

There is a story extant of a young wag who was 
invited to dine with a gentleman of rather sudden 
temper. The dining-room was on the second floor, 
and the principal dish was a fine roast fowl. When 
the old gentleman undertook to carve it, he found 
the knife rather dull, and, in a sudden passion, flung 
it down stairs after the servant. Whereupon the 
young man seized the fowl, and with admirable 
dexterity, hurried it after the knife. *' What on 
earth do you mean?' exclaimed the old gentleman. 
" I beg your pardon !" was the cool reply, ''I thought 
you were going to dine down stairs^ 



TO OBTAIN MINT SAUCE AT ANY SEASON OF 
THE YEAR. 

599. When mint is green and plentiful, 
cut it up fine, and put it into bottles. Fill the 



510 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

bottles with vinegar, and cork closely. The 
sugar can be added when required for use. 
No one can tell the difference of mint so 
prepared from that newly gathered from 
the bed. 

For those who like mint sauce, the above 
may be eaten with lamb or mutton chops. 

In attempting to carve a fowl, one day, a West- 
ern settler found considerable difficulty in sepa- 
rating its joints, and exclaimed against the man who 
had sold him an old hen for a chicken. " My dear," 
said the enraged man's wife, " don't talk so much 
against the aged and respectable Mr. B. ; he sowed 
the first patch of corn that was planted in our set- 
tlement." " I know that," was the reply, ** and 
/ believe this old hen scratched it up .'" 



MILK PORRIDGE, 



600. Boil some grits very thoroughly. 
When cold, pour over rich milk ; or, the 
grits may be warmed up in milk and served 
hot. This makes a very wholesome dish 
for children. 



THE YOUNG ^TFE's COOK BOOK. 511 
TO PRESERVE EGGS. 

601. Eggs should not be more than 
twenty-four hours old when they are stored. 
They may be kept several weeks by putting 
them in a jar of salt or lime water with the 
small end downwards. They may be kept 
for a long time by greasing them well with 
melted mutton suet, and placing them in a 
bin of bran, with their small end down- 
wards. Another way of keeping them 
fresh is to pour a gallon of boiling water on 
two quarts of quick lime, and a half pound 
of salt ; when cold, mix with an ounce of 
cream of tartar. Stir all well together, put 
the eggs in, and see that there is enough 
liquor to cover them. 

Customer. — " I wish to purchase some eggs to 
make a sponge cake; they must be very fresh." 

Shopkeeper. — "Ah, yes! I have some that can't 
be beaten." 

Customer. — " Can't be beaten !" 

Shopkeeper. — " No, ma'am, I defy any one to beat 
them." 

Customer. — " Then they won't do for me ; how 
can eggs be made into a sponge cake, unless they 
can be beaten ?" 



512 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

RICE FLUMMERY. 

602. Mix two tablespoonfals of rice 
flour with a little cold milk, and add to it a 
pint of boiled milk, sweetened and flavored 
with cinnamon and lemon peel. Boil this, 
stirring it constantly, and when sufficiently 
thick, pour it into a mould. When cold, 
turn it out and serve it with thick cream, 
or thin custard around it. 

A PERSON complaining of the smallness of some 
chops brought to table, an incorfigible wag observed 
that " Probably the sheep was fed upon short com- 
mons P^ 



POTATO YEAST. 



603. Boil a quarter of a peck of 
potatoes ; mash them fine, and thin them a 
little with the water in which they have 
been boiled. Add some salt, and a table- 
spoonful of brown sugar. When lukewarm, 
stir in about half a pint or more of old 



THE YOUNG WIPES COOK BOOK. bio 

yeast. Let it rise, then cover it closely 
and put it in a cool place. 



YEAST. 

604. Tie a large handful of hops in a 
thin bag, and boil them in three quarts of 
water. Moisten with cold water a sufficient 
quantity of flour, and stir in the hop-water 
while boiling hot. Add a handful of salt. 
Let it stand until it is about lukewarm, and 
then add about a pint of old yeast. When 
it is light, cover it, and stand it in a cool 
place. 



ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE YEAST. 

605. Tie a pint of hops in a thin bag, 
and boil them in three quarts of water. 
Add three tablespoonfuls of salt and two of 
molasses. Make a thin paste of flour and 

32 



514 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

cold water. Take out the hops and pour 
gradually the thin paste into the hop-water; 
then place it over the fire and let it boil a 
few minutes. Let it stand until it becomes 
lukewarm, add some old yeast, and as soon 
as it is light stand it away in a cool place. 

We ask advice, but we mean approbation. 



YEAST POWDERS. 

606. Dissolve separately one drachm 
and a half of tartaric acid, and the same 
quantity of bi-carbonate of soda. First put 
the soda into your batter, or whatever you 
wish to make light, and lastly stir in the 
tartaric acid. 



HAM OMELETTE. 

607. Beat four eggs very light, and add 
to them as much grated ham as will flavor

it, with salt and pepper to the taste. Fry 
it in hot butter till it is brown on the lower 
side. Serve it immediately. 

A WORTHY old farmer, residing in the vicinity of 
Mahopeck, was worried to death by unruly boarders. 
They found fault with his table, and said he had 
nothing fit to eat. " Hang it," said old Isaac, 
" what a fuss you're making, I can eat any thing." 
" Can you eat a crow, now?" said one of the board- 
ers. " Yes, I ken eat a crow." "Bet you a hat," 
said the guest. The bet was made, the crow 
shot, and roasted ; but, before serving it up they 
mischievously contrived to sprinkle it well with 
Scotch snuff. Isaac sat down to the crow. He 
took a good bite and began to chew away, but he 
made an awful face ; however, he persevered, and 
succeeded, and when he had finished, he said, with 
singular grimace. " You see I ken eat a crow, but 
I confess I shouldnH he inclined to hanker arter it /" 



CHEAP OMELETTE. 

608. If there are no social objections 
to your eating onions, try the following : 
Beat up the yolks of three eggs, add half of 
a good-sized onion, chopped very fine, and 
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. The 
shredding of the onion to a sufficient degree 



516 THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 

of fineness is very important, as the short 

time required to fry the omelette would be 

sufficient to cook the onion. Have ready 

some butter or nice dripping, which should 

be boiling hot when the beaten egg is 

stirred in. It should be of a light brown 

on the under side. It may be browned %n 

the top by holding the pan of the hot 

shovel over it. 

It was remarked by an eminent barrister, that 
learning in ladies should be as onions properly are 
in cookery — you should perceive the flavor, but not 
the thing itself. 



GREEN CORN OMELETTE. 

609. Take from four to six ears of 
green corn ; grate it off the cob ; add to this 
three eggs beaten light, salt and pepper to 
the taste. 

A SERVANT being sent to match a china plate, re- 
turned with one of a very different pattern. After 
scolding for some time, the mistress said, " Stupid, 
do you not see that the two are entirely different ?" 
"No mum," was the reply; "only o/ie of 'em is 
different." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 517 
BAKED EGG OMELETTE. 

610. Two tablespoonfuls of flour, one 
pint of milk, and three eggs. Moisten the 
flour gradually with the milk, beat it very 
smooth, beat the eggs very light, and add 
them to the flour and milk, season with 
salt; butter a pan, pour in the mixture; 
bake in a quick oven about three quarters 
of an hour. 

Bosom Friend. — " Well, dear, now that you are a 
widow, tell me, are you any the happier for it ?" 

Interesting Widow. — " Oh, no 1 Bat I have my 
freedom, and that's a great comfort. Do you know, 
my dear, I had an onion yesterday, for the first 
time these fourteen years ?" 



MINCED MEAT. 

611. Five pounds of beef or tongue, 
two pounds of suet, seven pounds of sugar, 
seven pounds of apples, three pounds of 
raisins, three pounds of currants, three nut- 
megs, two ounces of cinnamon, a dessert 
spoonful of ground allspice, one small tea- 



518 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

spoonful of ground mace, the juice of two 
lemons, and the grated rind of one. Moisten 
it with equal portions of wine, and cider. 
Brandy to the taste. Boil the meat in 
water, which has been salted in the propor- 
tion of one teaspoonful of salt, to every 
quart of water. When it is tender, stand it 
away, to get perfectly cold, before it is 
chopped. Wash, pick, and dry your cur- 
rants, prepare the spices, and seed the 
raisins. Pare and core the apples, chop 
them fine, chop the meat very fine, add the 
fruit, sugar, and spice, lemon juice, and 
grated lemon rind, (also the brandy and 
wine.) Mix the whole thoroughly ; it will 
be fit for use on the following day. If you 
wish to keep your minced meat for several 
weeks, chop the meat, and add the currants, 
raisins, sugar, and spice, but leave out the 
apples, lemon, wine, and cider; mix the 
other ingredients, and merely moisten it 
with brandy ; pack the mixture tightly in a 
stone jar, and cover it close. When you 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 519 

wish to make it into pies, take out some of 
the meat, chop your apples, and mix with 
it in the proportion given above. Moisten 
with cider, and add wine and brandy to 
your taste. 

Things to be remembered in December. — Be 
charitable to the poor, and be just to your connec- 
tions. Examine the state of your affairs, and pre- 
pare to improve your position by fresh energies. 
Take care of your health, not by reading the puffs 
of " quacker}^" and swallowing quack nostrums, 
but by exercising in fine weather, and by warmth 
a* nome in foggy and damp days and nights. 



A NICE LUNCHEON OR SUPPER CAKE 
FROM COLD VEAL. 

612. Take as much cold roasted lean 
veal as will fill a small cake mould, and 
mince it fine, together with a slice of ham, 
a piece of the crumb of bread soaked in cold 
milk, two eggs well beaten, a small bit of 
butter, the same of onion ; season with pep- 
per and salt, and mix all well together; 
butter the mould; fill it, and bake in an 



520 THE YOUKG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

oven for about an hour ; turn it out when 
cold, and cut into slices. Garnish with 
pickled eggs and parsley. 

Be not affronted at a jest ; if one throw salt at 
thee, thou wilt take no harm, uyiless thou hast sore 
places. 



BREAD JELLY. 

613. Cut the crumb of a roll into thin 
slices, and toast them equally of a pale 
brown ; boil them gently in water enough 
to rather more than cover them, till a jelly 
is produced, Avhich may be known by put- 
ting a little in a spoon to cool ; strain it 
upon a piece of lemon peel, and sweeten to 
taste ; a little wine may be added. This is 
a light and pleasant repast for invalids. 



BEVERAGE FROM CHERRIES. 

614. To one pint of cherry juice, put 
one pound of sugar. Boil it ten minutes, 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 521 

and skim it. When cool, bottle it, and 
cork it tight. 

A TOURIST stopping at a hotel saw on the bill of 
fare, " Fried Water Chicken." Desiring to know 
what this meant, he ordered a dish, and finding it 
excellent, recommended it to the rest of his party, 
ladies and all. The.y liked the dish wonderfully, 
and became frog-eaters without knowing it. 



A NICE PIE OF COLD VEAL, OR CHICKEN, 
AND HAM. 

615» Lay the crust into a shallow pie- 
dish, and fill it with the meat, prepared as 
follows : Shred cold veal or fowl, and half 
the quantity of ham, mostly lean ; put to it 
a little cream ; season with pepper, a little 
nutmeg, and a bit of garlic; cover with 
crust, and turn it out of the dish when 
baked. 

We are but farmers of ourselves ; yet may, 
If we can stock ourselves and thrive, display 
Much good treasure for the great rent day. 



522 THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 
BOTTLING WINE. 

616. The first thing to be attended to 
is the choice of good coi^ks ; they should be 
perfectly new, well cut, and flexible; any 
having black spots on them should be 
rejected. When the wine runs clear, place 
a shallow tub under the tap of the cask, 
and take care that there are two or three 
small holes near the bung or in it, to allow 
the air an ingress, to supply the place of 
the wine withdrawn. All being ready, 
hold the bottle under the tap in a leaning 
position. Fill the bottle to within two 
inches of the top of the neck, so that when 
the cork comes in, there may remain three- 
quarters of an inch of space between the 
wine and the lower end of the cork. The 
corks should be dipped, not soaked, in wine, 
and should enter with difiiculty; they are 
driven in with a wooden mallet. If the 
cork is to be waxed, it must be cut off to 
less than a quarter of an inch. Champagne 
bottles must have their corks driven about 



THE YOUNG WIFES COOK BOOK. 523 

half way, and fixed down by a wire, this 
makes them easy to draw. While a cask 
of wine is bottling off, it is impossible to 
exclude the admission of air to the surface 
of the liquor, except some particular method 
is employed, and if the operation lasts 
some time, the wine is almost certain to be 
injured; the best prevention of this, is a 
bottle of fine olive oil, which, being poured 
into the cask and floating on the surface of 
the wine, totally excludes the air, and pre- 
vents acidity or mouldiness for a whole 
year. When the crust, or precipitation of 
wine in bottles, is deposited in excess, and 
is about to be removed, the wine should be 
decanted into fresh bottles, or the deposit 
may mix with and injure the wine. Wine 
to be fit for bottling must not only be 
separated from the gross lees, and have 
attained perfect clearness by the fining, but 
it must also remain a certain time in the 
cask to ripen ; for this no precise rule can 
be laid down. Generally speaking, how- 



524 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

ever, wine should not be bottled until it has 
lost its sharpness, and is no longer liable to 
fermentation. When wine is bottled too 
soon, it often ferments and remains always 
sharp ; the best time to perform this opera- 
tion is in the month of March or October, 
especially if the weather be fine and clear. 

" That was a severe coughing fit," said the sex- 
ton to the undertaker, while they were taking a 
glass together. " Oh, 'tis nothing but a little ale 
which went the wrong way." '* Ah, ha 1 that's just 
like you," replied the sexton, "you always lay the 
coffin on the bier P^ 



CHICKEN CITERY. 

617. Remove the skin from a chicken, 
cut it up, and roll each piece in curry 
powder and flour mixed together (a table- 
spoonful of flour to half an ounce of curry). 
Fry two or three sliced onions in butter, 
when of a light brown put in the chicken, 
and fry them together till the chicken 
becomes brown, then stew them together in 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 525 

a little water for two or three hours. More 
water may be added if too thick. 

Do nothing in a passion ; why wilt thou put to 
sea in the violence of a storm ? 



EGG-NOG. 

618. Six eggs, one pint of milk, half a 
pound of loaf sugar, half a pint of brandy. 
Beat the eggs very light and thick, add the 
milk, sugar and brandy. 

Philip, king of Macedon, having drank too much 
wine, happened to determine a cause unjustly to the 
prejudice of a poor widow, who, when she heard his 
decree, boldly cried out, " I appeal to Philip sober." 
The king, struck with the peculiarity of the event, 
recovered his senses, heard the cause afresh, and, 
finding his mistake, ordered her to be paid out of 
his own purse, double the sum she was to have lost. 
This is an example worthy of imitation. 



TO BOAST COFFEE. 

619. Pick the black or imperfect 
grains from the coffee. Put it in a pan. 
and stir it all the time it is roasting ; when 



526 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

done, it should be the color of the hull 
of a ripe chestnut. It should be brown all 
through, but not black. About ten minutes 
before it is done, add to two pounds of 
coffee, half an ounce of butter. Whilst hot, 
put it in a box, and cover it closely. 

Notice of coffee, from Sir H. Blunt's travels in 
1534. " They (the Turks) have another drink, 
called cauphe, made of a berry as big as a small 
bean, dried in a furnace and beat to a powder, of a 
sooty color, that they seethe and drink, in taste, a 
little bitterish, but as may be endured — it is thought 
to be the old black broth, used so much by the 
Lacedemonians ; it drieth ill humors in the stomach, 
comforteth the brain, etc." 



USES FOR STALE BREAD. 

020. Stale bread may be cut into 
slices, and softened, by pouring a small 
quantity of boiling water over it. Cover 
the pan containing it, to prevent the escape 
of the steam. As soon as the bread is soft, 
season the slices with pepper and salt, have 
some hot lard, ham fat, or sausage dripping, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 527 

in a pan, dust a little flour, or Indian meal 
on each slice, and fry them a delicate 
brown. Boiling milk, if you have it, is bei^ 
ter than water to soften the bread. 



ANOTHER WAY TO USE STALE BREAD 

621. Rub the bread crumbs fine, pour 
enough hot milk over them to moisten 
them. Let them stand until they are 
quite soft. Beat up one egg, very light, to 
every pint of crumbs. Add the egg to the 
bread, and beat the whole till very smooth ; 
add a little salt, and enough yeast to raise 
the batter. When light, bake it on a 
griddle like buckwheat cakes. 



ANOTHER USE FOR STALE BREAD. 

622. Soak some bread in cold milk, 
drain the milk off, mash the bread very fine 



528 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

and mix witri it & quarter of a pound of 
boiled rice. Beat up two eggs light, add a 
little salt, mix all together thoroughly, and 
boil it in a bag for an hour. Serve it with 
any kind of sweet sauce. 

"Papa, I've been seeing cook make bread; and 
can you tell me why dough resembles the sun ?" 
" The sun, Freddy ?" " Yes, Pa." " No, I cannot."

PANCAKES WITHOUT EGGS. 

623. Mix four tablespoonfuls of dried 
flour with a pint of mild ale ; beat the bat- 
ter for a quarter of an hour. Dissolve half 
an ounce of fresh dripping, or lard, in a 
small frying-pan, pour in a fourth part of 
the batter, and fry both sides a pale brown 
color. Place the pancakes one on the other 
with a dessertspoonful of moist sugar sprink- 
led between. Each pancake requires half

A SAD CASE. — We were visiting at the house of a 
friend, where there were a number of young chil- 
dren. One of them had the measles, one the hooping 
cough. They were all receiving the greatest sympa- 
thy and attention, while one little girl, about five 
years old, sat in the corner, crying bitterly. We 
asked her what was the matter ? She replied, burst- 
ing out into a heart-breaking gush of tears. " Every 
one has got the measles and hooping cough, and I 
ain't got nothing, boo ! hoo hoc I" 



CARAMELS. 



624-. One cup of grated chocolate, one 
cup of milk, one cup of molasses, a piece of 
butter the size of an egg, one cup of sugar. 

Being at home. — The highest style of being at 
home grows out of a special state of the affections 
rather than of the intellect. Who has not met with 
individuals whose faces would be a passport to any 
society, and whose manners, the unstudied and 
spontaneous expressions of their inner selves, make 
them visibly welcome wherever they go, and attract 
unbounded confidence toward them in whatever 
the3^ undertake ? They are frank, because they have 
nothing to conceal ; afi'able, because their natures 
overflow with benevolence ; unflurried, because they 
dread nothing ; always at home, because they carry

within themselves that which can trust to itself any- 
where and everywhere — purit}^ of soul with fulness 
of health. Such are our best guarantees for feeling 
at home in all society to which duty takes us, and in 
every occupation upon which it obliges us to enter. 
They who live least for themselves are also the least 
embarrassed by uncertainties. 



CAKES MADE OF COLD MEAT OR POULTRY. 

625. Take any cold poultry, or meat, 
and mince it fine ; season with pepper and 
salt, to the taste ; mix thoroughly, and 
make into small cakes, with bread crumbs, 
and yolks of boiled eggs, or any of the 
forcemeats. Fry the cakes a light brown, 
and serve them hot. 

" It seems," said one dandy to another, at a party, 
** that they give no supper to night." To which the 
other coolly replied, " Then I stop my expenses,^^ 
and cooU}' took off his new gloves 1 



NEW ENGLAND BROWN BREAD. 

626. Take equal quantities of Indian 
meal and rye flour, scald the Indian meal, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 53] 

and when lukewarm, add the rye flour. 
Stir in enough lukewarm water to form a 
dough a little softer than for wheat bread. 
Add half a pint of good yeast and half a 
teacup of molasses. When it has risen, 
bake it well in a moderate oven. 



SODA BREAD. 

627. Three pints of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful of 
bicarbonate of soda, dissolved in half a tea- 
cup of warm water. Rub the cream of tar- 
tar in the flour, add a little salt, and stir in 
gradually some sweet milk and the soda, 
so as to form a dough. Mould it out into 
loaves, and bake in a moderate oven, so as 
to let it rise. It requires about three-quar- 
ters of an hour to bake, and should be a 
light brown. 



532 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 
MUSH BREAD. 

628. Boil some Indian mush in the 
usual way, and when lukewarm add to it 
some salt, yeast and enough wheat flour to 
form a soft dough. Let it rise; when light, 
knead it with only enough flour to prevent 
it adhering to the board. Make it into 
loaves, put them in the pans, let them rise 
again, and bake them. This is a more 
economical bread than that made with 
wheat. 



CORN BREAD. 

629. To two quarts of meal add one 
pint of bread sponge ; water sufiicient to 
wet the whole ; add half a pint of flour and 
a tablespoonful of salt; let it rise; then 
knead well for the second time, and place 
the dough in the oven, and allow it to bake 
an hour and a half. 

An industrious peasant in Picardy, being observed 
to purchase weekly live loaves, was asked what oc- 



THE TOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 533 

casion he could possibly have for so much bread. 
"One," replied the honest fellow, "is for myself; 
one I give away ; one I return, and the other two I 
lend." " How do you make that out?" " Why," 
returned the peasant, " the one which I take mj^self 
is /or my own use ; the second, which I give away, 
is for my mother in laio ; the loaf I return, is for my 
father ; and the other two, which I lend, are those 
with which I keep my two children, in hopes that 
they will one day return them to me.'' 



MILK BREAD. 
630. Procure good yeast, put it into 
your flour with sufficient salt. Warm the 
milk, add to it half a teaspoonful of bi-car- 
bonate of soda, and knead the dough for 
three quarters of an hour. Let it rise very 
light, then knead it again fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Place it in your bread pans and 
bake it in a moderate oven without letting 
it rise the second time. 

A Squire had a friend to visit him on business, 
and was very much annoyed w^hen his wife came to 
ask him what he wanted for dinner. "Go away I 
let us alone ;" impatiently said the squire. Business 
detained his friend till dinner time, and the squire 
urged him to remain. To the surprise of both, they 



534 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

saw nothing but a huge bowl of salad, which the 
good wife began quietly to serve up. " My dear," 
said the squire, " where are the meats ?" "You didn't 
order any," coolly answered the housewife. *' I 
asked what you would have, and you said, 'Lettuce 
alone I' Here it is." The friend burst into a laugh, 
and the squire, after looking lurid for a moment, 
joined him. " Wife, I give it up. Here is the 
money you wanted for that carpet which I denied 
you. Now let's have peace, and some dinner." The 
good woman pocketed the money, rang the bell, and 
a sumptuous repast was brought in. 



BREAD FRITTERS. 

631. Strew half a pound of currants on 
a dish, and dredge them well with flour; 
grate some bread into a pan until a pint of 
crumbs is produced ; pour over them a pint 
of boiling milk, in which two ounces of 
butter have been stirred ; cover the pan and 
let it stand for an hour. Then beat the 
mixture thoroughly, and add half a nutmeg 
grated, a quarter of a pound of white 
powdered sugar, and a wineglassful of 
brandy. Beat six eggs till very light, and 
stir them by degrees into the mixture. 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 535 

Lastly, add the currants, a few at a time, 
and mix the whole, thoroughly. It should 
be brought to the consistence of a thin 
batter, and if it turns out too thin, add a 
little flour. Have ready a heated frying- 
pan with boiling lard. Put in the batter in 
large spoonfuls, and fry the fritters to a 
light brown. Drain them on a perforated 
skimmer, or an inverted sieve placed in a 
deep pan, and send them to the table hot. 
Serve with wine and powdered sugar. 



GERMAN PUFFS. 

632. One pint of milk, three eggs, one 
pound of flour, one dessertspoonful of dis- 
solved salaeratus, a teaspoonful of butter, a 
saltspoon of salt. Beat the whites of the 
eggs, separately. The yolks must be as 
thick as batter, and the whites perfectly 
dry. Add to the yolks half the milk and 
half the flour, stir it well until the batter is 



536 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

smooth, then add the remainder of the flour 
and milk. Warm the butter, and stir in 
and beat the batter thus made, till it is 
light and full of bubbles. Stir in the salse- 
ratus, and lastly, the whites — but do not 
beat it after the whites have been added, as 
that will make it tough. Butter teacups, 
or an earthen mould, pour in the batter, 
and bake it in a moderate oven. Serve 
with butter and sugar, or any kind of sauce 
which may be preferred. They require 
from half an hour to three quarters to bake. 

A VAIN hope flattereth the heart of a fool ; but he 
that is wise pursueth it not. 



POTATO PUFPS. 

633. Dissolve two ounces of loaf sugar 
in a wineglassful of new milk ; rub three 
ounces of mealy potato (boiled) to fine 
powder; mix these together ; add the grated 
rind of a small lemon and the yolks of three 
fresh eggs ; beat for ten minutes ; then add 



THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 537 

the whites, beaten to a froth; butter ^ve 
small tin moulds ; put a fifth part of the 
mixture into each, and bake in a quick 
oven about eighteen minutes. Serve imme- 
diately, with sugar sifted over them. 

This instant is thine, the next, is in the womb of 
futurity, and thou knowest not what it may bring 
forth. 



A CHARTREUSE OF APPLE AND RICE. 

634. Boil six ounces of rice, with a 
stick of cinnamon, in milk until it is thick, 
stirring in a spoonful of rose water or 
orange flower water. Pare ten or twelve 
apples — golden pippins are the best — scoop 
out the core, and fill up the orifice with 
raspberry jam. Border a deep dish with 
paste; put in the apples, leaving a space 
between, and fill it up with rice. Brush 
the whole over with the yolk of an egg, 
and sift sugar thickly over it; form a

pattern on top with sweatmeats, and bake 
it for one hour in a quick oven. 

Influence of light upon the Human Constitu- 
tion. — Dupuytren, the French phj^sician, relates 
the case of a lad}^ whose maladies had baffled the 
skill of several eminent practitioners. The lady re- 
sided in a dark room, into which the sun never 
shone, in one of the narroAV streets of Paris. After 
a careful examination, Dupuytren was led to refer 
her complaints to the absence of light, and recom- 
mended her removal to a more cheerful situation. 
This change was followed by the most beneficial re- 
sults, and all her complaints vanished. Sir James 
W3'lie has given a remarkable instance of the influ- 
ence of light. He states that the cases of disease 
on the dark side of a barrack at St. Petersburg have 
been uniforml}^, for many years, in the proportion 
of three to one to those on the side exposed to 
strong light. The experiments of Dr. Edwards are 
conclusive. He has shown that if tadpoles are 
nourished with proper food, and exposed to the 
constantly renewed contact of water (so that their 
beneficial respiration may be maintained), but are 
entirely deprived of light, their growth continues, 
but their metamorphosis into the condition of air- 
breathing animals is arrested, and they remain iu 
the form of large tadpoles. Dr. Edwards also ob- 
serves that persons who live in caves or cellars, or 
in very dark and narrow streets are apt to produce 
deformed children ; and that men who work in 
mines are liable to disease, which can only be attri- 
buted to the withdrawal of the blessings of light.

HOUSEWIFERY. 

WASHING. 

635. All the water used for washing 
must be soft, otherwise the clothes cannot 
be made clean. Soap, instead of dissolving 
and forming suds, will always curdle and 
float on the surface of water that is either 
hard from being impregnated with lime or 
other mineral substances, or brackish from 
its vicinity to the sea. The best way of 
softening hard water is to mix with it a 
large quantity of strong lye, in the propor- 
tion of one gallon of lye to three or four of 
water. Soda is sometimes used, but it is 
objectionable as it injures the texture of the 
clothes. 

Where all the water is hard it is usual to 
save rain water by catching it in cisterns, 
or casks placed under the water spouts. 
Kain water casks should always have 
covers to prevent impurities from getting 
into the water. They should stand on feet 



540 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK 

and be furnished with a spigot for drawing 
the water when wanted. Without an abun- 
dance of water it is impossible to wash the 
clothes clean, or to make them a good color, 
and where a sufRciency can be obtained, no 
good washer will be sparing in the use of it. 
Washing in dirty suds is of very little avail. 

In using soda in washing, the best 
method is to boil three quarters of a pound 
of soap and an ounce of soda in a gallon of 
water till they are completely dissolved, 
then pour the liquid out to be used at once. 

The bleaching of linen or muslin is best 
effected by first washing the articles in cool 
soap suds, and laying them on the grass at 
night to receive the dew ; repeat this pro- 
cess for a few days. 



TO WASH A COUNTERPANE. 

636. Rub it well with soap, and put it 
over night in a tub of lukewarm water. 
Next morning, wash it out of the water it 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 541 

was soaked in, then wring it out and wash 
it in some clean soap suds ; after which 
wash it through a second sud warmer than 
the first. Rinse it twice through 'plenty of 
cold water. The last rinse water should 
have a little blue in it. Wring the counter- 
pane out, hang it in the sun to dry, wrong 
side outward. Take it in toward evening 
and the next day hang it with the right 
side out. It must on no account be put 
away with the slightest dampness about it. 
It may take three days to dry perfectly. 
In washing a quilt or counterpane never 
use soda. 



TO WASH COLORED DRESSES. 

637. Have ready plenty of clean, soft 
water. It spoils colored clothes to wash 
them in the dirty suds the white clothes 
have been washed in. The water should 
be warm, but by no means hot, as that 



542 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

would injure the colors. Rub enough soap 
in the water to make a strong lather before 
the chintz is put into it. Wash it tho- 
roughly; then wash it in a second clean 
warm suds, and rinse it well. Have ready 
a pan filled with weak starch, tinged with a 
little blue. Painted lawns or muslins will 
be much improved by mixing a little gum 
arabic water with the starch ; for instance, 
a tablespoonful. Put the dress into it, and 
run it through the starch. Then squeeze it 
out, open it well, clap it, and hang it out 
immediately to dry in the shade; taking 
the sleeve by the cuffs and pinning them up 
to the skirt, so as to spread them wide, and 
causing them to dry the sooner. If colored 
clothes continue wet too long, no precaution 
can prevent the colors from running into 
streaks. Tiiis will certainly happen if they 
are allowed to lie in the water. They 
must always be done as fast as possible, till 
the whole process is completed. If the 
colors are once injured, nothing can restore 



THE TOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 543 

them ; but by good management they may 
always be preserved ; unless in coarse low 
priced calicoes, and many of them wash per- 
fectly well. As soon as the dress is quite 
dry^ take it in. It is always the best way 
to fold and iron it immediately. Another 
way of fixing the colors in a dress is to grate 
raw potato into the water in which the 
dress is washed. If dresses are to be put 
by for the winter season, they should 
always be washed and dried, but not 
starched nor ironed. They should be 
rolled up closely in a towel. 



TO WASH A BOOK MUSLIN DRESS. 

638. Make a strong suds with white 
soap and warm water. Put in the dress 
and wash it well; squeezing and pressing 
rather than rubbing it; as book muslin 
tears easily, and, without great care, will not 
last long. Wash it through a second suds, 



544 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOE!. 

and then pass it through two rinsing 
waters ; adding a very little blue to the last. 
Then open out the dress; and while wet, 
run it through a thin starch, diluted with 
water either warm or cold. Stretch it, and 
hang it in the sun to dry. Afterward, 
sprinkle it and roll it up in a clean fine 
towel, letting it lie for half an hour or more. 
Then open it out, stretch it even, and clap 
it in your hands till clear all over. Have 
irons ready, and iron it before it is too dry 
on the wrong side, whenever practicable. 
Take care that the irons are not too hot, as 
it will scorch easily. When done, do not 
fold the dress, but hang it up in a press or 
wardrobe. In ironing, be very careful to 
get the hem even. Many persons, previous 
to having them washed, rip out the hems 
of their thin muslin dresses, afterward run- 
ning them over again. This is a good plan, 
if you are willing to take the trouble. 



THE YOUNG ^IFE'S COOK BOOK. 545 

TO MAKE WASHING FLUID. 

639. Add one pound of unslaked lime, 
to three gallons of soft, boiling water. Let 
it settle and pour off. Then add three 
pounds of washing soda, and mix with the 
lime water. When dissolved, use a large 
wineglassful to each pailful of water. Add 
one gill of soft soap to a pailful of water. 



TO PREPARE STARCH. 

640. Put two or three tablespoonfuls 
of starch into a bowl, and mix it gradually, 
with just enough of clear cold water to con- 
vert it into a thin paste, pressing out all the 
lumps with the back of the spoon till it 
becomes perfectly smooth ; then pour it into 
a clean pipkin or skillet. Have ready a 
kettle of boiling water, and by degrees add 
some of it to the starch, stirring it well. 
A pint or a quart of the hot water may 
be allowed, according as it is desired that 

34 



546 THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK 

the starcli should be thick, thin, or of a 
moderate consistence. Set it on hot coals 
and boil it thoroughly for half an hour. If 
not well boiled, it will fail to be glutinous. 
When it has boiled for about fifteen 
minutes, stir it a few times, for a moment 
each time, with the end of a spermaceti 
candle. This will prevent it becoming 
sticky. If a spermaceti candle is not at 
hand, sprinkle in a little salt, about a tea- 
spoonful to a pint of starch or throw in a 
piece of loaf sugar. Finish by stirring it 
vigorously with a spoon. Strain the starch 
through a white cloth into a large pan, and 
squeeze into it a very little blue from the 
indigo bag ; but it must be very little. 



TO PREPARE COMMON STARCH. 

641. Put a sufficient quantity of dry 
starch (for instance, from two to three table- 
spoonfuls) into a bowl, and mix it gradually 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 547 

with just enough of clear cold water to 
make it a thin paste, pressing out all the 
lumps with the back of the spoon till you 
get it perfectly smooth. Then pour it into 
a clean pipkin or skillet. Have ready a 
kettle of boiling water, and by degrees add 
some of it to the starch, stirring it well. 
You may allow from a pint to a quart of the 
hot water, according as you wish to have 
the starch thick, thin, or moderate. Set it 
on the fire, and boil it well for half an hour. 
If not well boiled, it will not be glutinous. 
When it has boiled about fifteen minutes, 
stir it a few times (merely for a moment 
each time) with the end of a spermaceti 
candle. This will prevent its being sticky ; 
but take care not to stir it too much. If 
you have no spermaceti, sprinkle in a little 
salt (about a teaspoonful to a pint of 
starch), which will answer a similar purpose, 
or throw in a lump of loaf sugar. Finish 
by stirring it hard with a spoon. 

Strain the starch through a white cloth 



548 THE YOUNG WTFE's COOK BOOK. 

into a large pan, and squeeze into it a little 
blue from the indigo bag. 

For common colored dresses you may 
make the starch with fine flour mixed as 
above. 

Gentlemen's collars should be quite dry- 
before they are starched. Dip them into 
warm starch and let them dry again per- 
fectly. They must then be dipped into 
cold water, spread out smoothly on a clean 
towel and rolled up tightl}^ If the starch 
is properly prepared and the above rules 
adhered to, the linen will have a fine gloss 
when ironed. 



STIFFNESS TO COLLARS. 

642. A little gum arable and common 
soda, added to the starch, gives extreme 
stiffness and gloss to collars. 

An inquiry. — " Father," said a little boy, the 
other day, " are not sailors very small men ?" " No, 
my dear," replied the father, " pray, what leads you 



THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 549 

to suppose they are so small ?" " Because," replied 
the child, "I read the other day of a sailor going to 
sleep in his watch." 



RULES IN REGARD TO IRONING. 

643. Be careful in ironing lace, ribbons, 
or any long, narrow strips, not to stretch 
them crooked, but iron them slowly, 
straight, and evenly ; and with the point 
of the iron press out every scallop sepa- 
rately. Needlework should always be ironed 
on the wrong side. In ironing collars, care 
should be taken not to stretch one half the 
collar more than the other They should 
be ironed first lengthways, then crossways. 
Sheets and table-cloths should be ironed 
with a large iron pressed on them heavily. 

All colored clothes require a cooler iron 
than white clothes, as too great heat is 
liable to injure the colors. Chintz should 
be ironed on the wrong side, as the starch 
is apt to show on colored clothing when 
ironed on the right side. 



550 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

When ironing a dress, if the table is not 
large enough, set a chair in a convenient 
place to receive the sleeves, or any part 
which may hang down, so as not to let them 
touch the floor. First iron the body, next 
the sleeves, and lastly the skirt. A skirt 
board should be made wide at the bottom 
gradually narrowing toward the top. Cover 
it first with a piece of blanket, and then 
with coarse muslin ; both of which must 
be sewed over it tightly and smoothly. 
This board is to slip into the skirt of a dress, 
w^hich may thus be ironed without a crease. 
Puffings or gatherings should be folded or 
creased in half along the middle, and ironed 
out like a flounce or ruffle. 

In ironing a shirt, begin at the bosom, 
then iron the sleeves, and lastly the back. 
A small board, covered like that used for 
dresses, will be found very useful to slip 
under the bosoms of shirts when ironing 
them. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 551 

TO CLEAN GOLD ORNAMENTS. 
644. Make a lather of soap and water, 
and wash the articles; then lay them in 
dry powdered magnesia. When dry, rub 
them with a piece of flannel ; or, if embossed, 
use a brush. Or the articles may be washed 
in soapsuds, and while wet, put them in a 
bag with some clean fresh bran, or sawdust; 
shake them, and they will look almost like 
new. 

The following story is told of a Yankee captain 
and his mate : — Whenever there was a plum pud- 
ding made by the captain's orders, all the plums 
were put into one end of it, and that placed next 
the captain, who after helping himself, passed it to 
the mate, who never found any plums in any part 
of it. After this game had been played for some 
time, the mate prevailed on the steward to place the 
suet-end next to the captain, who no sooner perceived 
the alteration than picking up the dish, and turning 
it round, as if to examine the china, he said, " This 
cost me two shillings in Liverpool," and putting it 
down as if without design, with the plum-end next 
to himself " Is it possible ?" said the mate, taking 
up the dish. " I shouldn't suppose it was worth 
more than a shilling ;" and, as if in perfect innocence, 
he put it down the contrar}^ way. The captain looked 
at the mate ; the mate looked at the captain, and 
both laughed. "I'll tell you what, young'n," said 
the captain, '* you've found me out ; so we'll just cut 
the pudding lengthwise this time, and have the 
plums fairly distributed hereafter." 



552 THE YOUNG T\'IFe's COOK BOOK. 
PASTE FOR CLEANING PLATE. 

645. Break up two cakes of whiting, 
into three pints of cold water, stir it well, 
so as to wash out all the grit, then let it 
stand till it settles to the bottom ; pour off 
the water, and put the whiting into the 
oven to dry. Scrape off the sandy sediment. 
Dissolve three quarters of a pound of soft 
soap ; mix half of the whiting into it ; add 
three quarters of a gill of spirits of wine ; 
stir till in a soft paste, then put it into 
covered pots ; the rest of the whiting to be 
kept in a lump for polishing. 

Yet be not puffed np in thine own conceit, neither 
boast of superior understanding ; the dearest of 
human knowledge is but blindness and folly. 



TO TAKE STAINS OUT OF SILVER. 

646. Steep the silver in soap ley for 
the space of four hours ; then cover it over 
with whiting, wet with vinegar, so that it 
may lie thick upon it, and dry it by a fire ; 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 55P» 

after which rub off the whiting, and pass it 
over with dry bran, and the spots will not 
only disappear, but the silver will look ex- 
ceedingly bright. 



TO REMOVE INK STAINS FROM SILVER. 

647. The tops and other portions of 
silver ink-stands frequently become deeply 
discolored wdth ink, which is difficult to re- 
move by ordinary means. It may, how- 
ever, be completely eradicated by making a 
little chloride of lime into a paste with 
water, and rubbing it upon the stains. 

An hour's industry will do more to beget cheer- 
fulness, suppress evil humors, and retrieve your 
affairs, than a month's moaning. 



TO CLEAN SILVER WARE. 

648. The most common method of 
cleaning silver, is with pulverized whiting 



554 THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

and whisky, or with spirits of wine, which 
is better ; the whiting must be made as fine 
as possible, for if there are any coarse or 
rough particles among it, they will scratch 
the silver ; you may powder it very finely, 
either by pounding it in a mortar, or by 
tying it up in a clean rag, and beating it 
with a hammer, after which, spread it 
thinly over a large plate, and place it before 
the fire to dry, then sift it through a piece 
of coarse book-muslin or leno, mix the 
whiting into a paste or cream, with whisky 
or spirits of wine, dip a flannel or sponge 
into it, and coat the silver all over with the 
mixture, after which, lay all the articles in 
the sun to dry, or place them on an old 
waiter before the fire, but not very near it ; 
the paste must become so dry on the articles 
that you may dust it off them like flour, 
with a soft cloth, afterwards, with the 
smallest brush, rub between the prongs of 
the forks, and go over all the minute or 
delicate parts of the silver ; the plain or un- 



THE YOUNG T^IFE's COOK BOOK. 555 

ornamented parts are best rubbed with 
flannel, as they show the most trifling 
scratches ; next polish with a buckskin or a 
chamois leather, and finish with a soft silk 
handkerchief; before you begin to clean 
your plate, wash it in boiling water, that no 
grease or syrup may remain on it. 

Nothing so much vexes a surgeon as to be sent for 
in great haste, and to find after his arrival that 
nothing, or next to nothing, is the matter with his 
patient. We read of an '' urgent case" of this kind 
recorded of an eminent surgeon. He had been sent 
for by a gentleman who had just received a slight 
wound, and gave his servant orders to go home with 
all haste imaginable, and fetch a certain plaster 
The patient, turning a little pale, said ; " Heaven, 
sir, I hope there is no danger !" " Indeed there is," 
answered the surgeon ; " for if the fellow doesn't 
run like a race-horse the wound will be healed be- 
fore he can possibly get backl" 



ANOTHER MODE OF CLEANING SILVER. 

649. Silver door-plates are most ex- 
peditiously cleaned with a weak solution of 
ammonia and water, say, one teaspoonful of 
ammonia to one teacup of water, applied 



556 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

witli a wet rag ; it is equally useful in clean- 
ing other silver plate and gold jewelry. 

Mr. lives in street. His wife, who is an 

economical body, had sent a silk gown to a French 
d^^er. The dyer called to ask for some farther in- 
structions than those he had received, when, as 
it happened, he met the husband of the lady at 
the door. " Is madam within ?" asked the French- 
man, with an emphatic gesticulation. " And sup- 
pose she is, what do 3'ou want with her?" " Oh! 1 
am dying for her, save /" " What I you dying for 
my wife ! get out of my house, you scoundrel 1" He 
had just raised his foot to kick monsieur into the 
street, when the timely appearance of the lady led 
to the necessary explanation. 



TO CLEAN BLOCK TIN DISH-COVERS, Etc. 

650. Having washed the block tin 
articles quite clean in warm water, rub the 
inside with soft rags moistened with fine 
wet whiting. Then take a soft linen cloth, 
and go over the outside with a little sweet 
oil. Next rub it all over with fine whiting, 
powdered and sifted and put on dry. 
Afterward finish with a clean dry cloth. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 557 

Block tin dish covers cleaned in this way 
with oil and whiting will preserve their 
polish, and continue to look new, provided 
that they are always wiped dry as soon 
as they are brought from the table. Block 
tin pans and kettles may be cleaned with 
fine whiting and water, inside and outside. 

Why should not a child's fancy in the way of food 
— we refer to its intense dislike of certain things — 
be regarded, as well as the repugnance of an adult ? 
We consider it a great piece of cruelty to force a 
child to eat things that are repulsive to it, because 
somebody once wrote a wise saw to the effect, " that 
children should eat whatever is set before them." 
We have often seen the poor little victims shudder 
and choke at the sight of a bit of fat meat, or a little 
Bcum of cream on boiled milk, toothsome enough to 
those who like them, but in their case a purgatorial 
infliction. Whenever there is this decided antipathy 
nature should be respected, even in the person of 
the smallest child ; and he who would act otherwise 
is himself smaller than the child over whom he 
would so unjustifiably tyrannize. 



TO CLEAN BRASS, No. 1. 

651. Finely-powdered salammoniac ; 
water to moisten. Rock alum, one part; 



558 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

water, sixteen parts. Mix; warm the 
articles to be cleaned, then rub with either 
of the above mixtures, and finish with 
tripoli. This process will give them the 
brilliancy of gold. 



TO CLEAN BRASS, No. 2. 

652. Dissolve in a pint of soft water 
an ounce of oxalic acid, and keep it in a 
bottle labelled " Poison." Always shake it 
well before using it. Rub it on the brass 
with a flannel, and then take a dry flannel 
to polish it. Have ready some pulverized 
rotten-stone, sifted through a piece of 
muslin, and mixed with oil of turpentine, 
so as to be liquid. Rub this on with a 
cloth, let it rest ten minutes, and then wipe 
it off with a buckskin. Brass cleaned in 
this manner looks beautifully. 

For cleaning brasses belonging to ma- 
hogany furniture, either powdered whiting 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 559 

or scraped rotten-stone mixed with sweet 
oil, and rubbed on with a buckskin, is ex- 
cellent. Let it rest a little while, and then 
wipe it well off, seeing that none of the 
mixture lodges in the hollows of the brass. 
In cleaning brass handles, hold the handle 
firmly with one hand, while you clean with 
the other, otherwise the handle will soon 
become loosened by the unsteadiness of the 
friction. Oxalic acid being poisonous, care 
must be taken that none of the liquid gets 
into your eyes, when used for rubbing. 
Should this by any accident happen, im- 
mediately get a bowlful, to the brim, of cold 
water, and hold the eyes open in it, till the 
pain abates ; repeating it at intervals during 
the day. 



TO CLEAN BRASS, No. 3. 

653. Powder half a pound of rotten- 
stone very fine, and mix it with an ounce 



560 THE YOUNG WTFE's COOK BOOK. 

of oxalic acid, dissolved in as much water 
as will make it a stiff paste when perfectly 
dry ; powder it very fine, and put it in a 
bottle for use, and label it '' Poison." 
When you wish to use it, mix a little with 
as much sweet oil as will make it a stiff 
paste. Rub it well on the brass with the 
leather; then take another clean leather 
and polish it. 

A WITTY fellow slipped down on an icy pavement. 
While sitting, he muttered, " I have no desire to 
see the town burnt, but I sincerel}^ wish the streets 
were laid in ashes." 



TO CLEAN A BRASS OR COPPER KETTLE. 

654. A brass, bell metal, or copper 
kettle should always be cleaned immedi- 
ately after it is used. Even when not used 
it will require occasional cleaning, otherwise 
it will collect rust or verdigris, which is a 
strong poison. After washing the kettle 
with warm water, put into it a teacupful 



THE YOUIS^G TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 561 

of vinegar, and a tablespoonful of salt, place 
it over the fire; when hot, rub the kettle 
thoroughly with a cloth, taking care that 
the salt and vinegar shall touch every part 
then wash it with warm water ; next take 
some wood ashes, or fine sand, and scour 
it well, afterward wash it with hot soap 
suds, and finish by rinsing it in cold water ; 
and wiping it dry. 

Wink at small injuries rather than avenge them. 
If to destroy a single bee, you throw down the hive, 
instead of one enemy you make a thousand. 



TO CLEAN BRITANNIA METAL. 

655. Sift rotten-stone through a muslin 
or hair sieve ; mix with it as much soft soap 
as will bring it to the stiffness of putty ; to 
about half a pound of this add two ounces 
of oil of turpentine. It may be made up 
into balls, or put into gallipots ; it will soon 
become hard, and will keep any length of 
time, When the metal is to be cleaned, 

35 



562 THE YOUNG ttife's cook book. 

rub it first with a piece of flannel moistened 
with sweet oil ; then apply a little of the 
paste with the finger, till the polish is pro- 
duced ; then wash the article with soap and 
hot water, and, wdien dry, rub with soft 
wash-leather, and a little fine whiting. 



TO CLEAN CANDLESTICKS. 

656. Whether the candlesticks be 
silver, plated, or japanned, the first care 
must be to remove the drops of grease by 
pouring boiling water upon them, and im- 
mediately wiping them with a soft cloth. 
Never place them before the fire to melt 
the grease, as there is danger of melting 
the solder or injuring the plating. Metal 
articles will afterward need polishing wuth 
plate-powder. 

Greatness lies not in being strong, but in the 
right use of strength ; and strength is not used 
rightly when it only serves to carry a man above 
his fellows for his own solitary glory, idle is the 
greatest whose strength carries up the ujost heart* 
By the attraction of his own. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 563 
TO CLEAN MATTING. 

657. Straw matting should be washed 
but seldom, as much dampness is injurious 
to it. When it is necessary to clean a floor 
mat, do it by washing with a large coarse 
cloth dipped in salt water ; and, as you pro- 
ceed, wiping it dry with another coarse 
cloth. The salt will prevent the matting 
from turning yellow. If, in putting down a 
floor mat, you have occasion to join it 
across, ravel about an inch at the end of 
each breadth, and tie or knot the lengthway 
threads two together. Then turning all 
these knotted threads underneath, lay one 
edge over the other of the pieces to be 
joined, and tack them down to the floor 
with a row of very small tacks ; each tack 
having a little bit of buckskin on it, to pre- 
vent the head of the nail from injuring or 
wearing out the mat. This ravelling the 
ends of the breadths, and knotting and 
turning under their threads, obviates the 
inconvenience of a thick conspicuous ridge, 



564 THE YOUNG WTFE'S COOK BOOK. 

if the edge of the matting is folded under in 
its full substance. Worsted binding is 
generally used for matting ; but as this is 
sometimes destroyed by moths, it is safer to 
secure the edge of the mat with the suffi- 
ciently durable binding of colored linen or 
thick cotton tape. 

A MAN in Lowell has, for many weeks past, been 
sadly afflicted with drowsiness, and a desire to sleep, 
even before the day has fairl}^ closed. For a long 
time he was unable to discover the cause, but at last 
did so. He has been in the habit of eating eggs, 
fried, boiled, and raw, with his breakfast, and he 
conceives that they have so entered into his system, 
that it becomes necessar}- for him to retire when the 
hens go to roost. If it also has the effect of arousing 
him in the morning, when the hens begin to stir, the 
result would probably be beneficial. But of this 
there is some doubt. 



TO EXTRACT GREASE FROM PAPERED 
WALLS. 

658. Dip a piece of flannel in spirits of 
wine, rub the greasy spots gently once or 
twice, and the grease will disappear. 



THE YOUNG TnF{:*S COOK BOOK. 565 

A YOUNG lady should often maintain a prudent re- 
serve and silence in the j^resence of her lover; he 
will be certain to fancy her a great deal wiser than 
she can show herself by her talk. 



TO CLEAN PAPER HANGINGS. 

659. All the dust must first be brushed 
from the walls. Then divide a loaf of stale 
white bread ; take the crust into your hand, 
and beginning at the top of the paper, wipe 
it downwards in the lightest manner with 
the crumb. Do not cross or go upward. 
The dirt of the paper and the crumbs will 
fall together. Do not wipe above half a 
yard, at a stroke, and after doing all the 
upper part, go round again, beginning a lit- 
tle above where you left off. If you do not 
do it extremely lightly, you will make the 
dirt adhere to the paper. 

Master. — John, what is the meaning of "fria- 
ble?" 

John. — Something to be fried. 



566 THE YOUNG "WIFE's COOK BOOK. 
TO CLEAN GREASY CARPETS. 

660. The carpets must be taken up, 
beaten and shaken ; remove the grease 
spots, which must be effected by means of a 
paste made of boiling water poured on equal 
quantities of magnesia and fuller's earth ; 
cover all the grease spots with this paste 
while it is hot, and let it remain till quite 
dry, then brush it off, and the grease will 
have disappeared. Carpets must be washed 
with boiling water in which common yellow 
soap and soda have been dissolved, in the 
proportion of an ounce of soap and a drachm 
of soda to each two gallons of water. The 
method of washing is to dip a clean flannel 
into the cleansing liquid and quickly wash 
over a certain portion of the carpet ; then, 
before it can dry, dip another flannel into a 
pail of perfectly clean hot water, and wash 
the same part over again. Then proceed to 
wash another portion, first with the cleans- 
ing, and then with the pure water, and go 
on thus till the whole surface has been 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 567 

cleansed and rinsed in the clean water : not 
more than a yard square should be washed 
at once. When perfectly dry it should be 
again rubbed over with a clean flannel, 
dipped in a strong solution of ox-gall and 
water. This process, though tedious, entire- 
ly renovates faded and soiled and greasy 
carpets. 

A GENTLEMAN, at One time a strong advocate 
of teetotalisra, now a bottle manufacturer, was 
recently asked by an acquaintance how he could 
reconcile his former professions with his present 
practice. "Oh," was the reply, "when I started 
bottle making, to be consistent I also began to 
drink beer." 



TO CLEAN FLOOR-CLOTHS. 

661. Sweep, then wipe them with a 
flannel ; and when all dust and spots are re- 
moved, rub with a waxed flannel, and then 
with a clean one ; use but little wax, and 
rub only enough to give a little smoothness. 
Washing now and then with milk after the 
above sweeping, and dry rubbing makes 



568 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

them look fresh. An oilcloth should never 
be scrubbed with a brush ; but, after being 
first swept, it should be cleaned by washing 
with a large soft cloth and lukewarm water. 
On no account use soap, or take water that 
is Tiot ; as either of them wdll bring off the 
paint. 



TO CLEAN ALABASTER. 

662. Alabaster is a species of soft 
marble used for ornamental purposes, which 
derives its name from Alabastron, a town 
of Egypt, where a manufactory formerly ex- 
isted of works of art in domestic vessels, 
executed from the stone found in the neigh- 
boring mountains. As this composition is 
of a delicate nature, easily scratched, and 
soon stained by the smoke or atmosphere, 
all objects should be preserved from these 
external influences by being kept under 
glass shades. Should they however become 



THE YOUNG ^IFe's COOK BOOK. 569 

stained, the following is the best method. 
Remove the stains by brushing with soap 
and water, then whitewash the stained 
part, and let it remain for some hours ; 
after which remove the whitewash, rub the 
stained part with a soft cloth, and the 
stains will have disappeared. Grease spots 
may be removed by rubbing the blemishes 
wdth powdered French chalk, or a little oil 
of turpentine. 



TO CLEAN IRON FROM RUST. 

663. Pound some glass to fine powder; 
and, having nailed some linen or woolen 
cloth upon a board, lay upon it a strong 
coat of gum-water, and sift thereon some of 
your powdered glass, and let it dry. Re- 
peat this operation three times, and when 
the last covering of powdered glass is dry, 
you may easily rub ofi" the rust from iron 
utensils with the cloth thus prepared.

YiRTUE WITHOUT PEAR. — When, upon mature de- 
liberation, you are persuaded a thing is fit to be 
done, do it boldly ; and do not affect privacy in it, 
or concern yourself at all, what impertinent cen- 
sures or reflections the world will pass upon it. 
For if the thing be not just and innocent, it ought 
not to be attempted at all, though never so secretly. 
And if it be, you do very foolishly to stand in fear 
of those who will themselves do ill in censuring and 
condemning what you do well. — Epictetus. 



TO CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES. 

664. Put a few drops of hartshorn in 
a quart of water. Shake the brushes in it, 
rinse them in some clean water, and stand 
them on their ends to dry. A little borax 
in water will clean them very nicely. 

" Have you dined ?" said a lounger to his friend. 
" I have, upon my honor," replied he. " Then," re- 
joined the first, " if you have dined upon your honor, 
you must have made but a scanty meal. 



TO CLEANSE MATTRESSES. 

665. Hair mattresses that have be- 
come hard and dirty, can be made nearly 



THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 571 

as good as new, by ripping them, washing 
the ticking, and picking the hair free from 
bunches, and keeping it in a dry, airy place, 
several days, dry the ticking well, fill it 
lightly with the hair and tack it together. 

An honest farmer was invited to attend a party 
at a village squire's one evening, where there was 
music, vocal and instrumental. On the following 
morning he met one of the guests, who said, " Well, 
farmer, how did you enjoy yourself last night ? 
Were not the quartettes excellent ?" " Why really, 
sir, I can't say," said he, "for I didnH taste 'em; 
but the pork chops were first-rate." 



TO CLEANSE THE INSIDE OF JARS. 

666. Fill them with hot water, and 
stir in a spoonful or more of pearlash. 
Empty them in an hour, and if not perfectly 
clean, fill again and let them stand a few 
hours. For large vessels ley may be used. 

Clutterbuck's story of the old lady (his aunt) is 
excellent. Being very nervous, she told Sir Walter 
Farquhar she thought Bath would do her good. 
"It's very odd," said Sir Walter, "but that's the 
very thing that I was going to recommend to you. 



572 THE YOU.VG wife's COOK BOOK. 

I will write the particulars of 3^onr case to a very 
clever man there, in whose hands you will be well 
taken care of." The lady, furnished with the letter, 
set off, and on arriving at Newberry, feeling as 
usual very nervous, she said to her confidant, 
" Long as Sir Walter has attended me, he has never 
explained to me what ails me. I have a great mind 
to open his letter, and see what he has stated of my 
case to the Bath physician." In vain her friend 
represented to her the breach of confidence this 
would be. She opened the letter, and read, " Dear 
Davis, keep the old lady three weeks, and then send 
her back again." 



TO CLEAN LAMP SHADES. 

667. Lamp shades of ground glass 
should be cleaned with soap or pearlash; 
these will not injure or discolor them. 

The reasoning power is the corner-stone of the 
intellectual building, giving grace and strength to 
the whole structure. 



TO CLEAN MARBLE. 

668. Marble is best cleaned with a 
little clean soap and water, to which some 



THE YOUNG T^'IFE's COOK BOOK. 573 

ox-gall may be added. Acids should be 

avoided. Marble door steps should be 

cleaned with sand and clean water. No 
soap should be used. 



TO WHITEN PIANO KEYS. 

669. Rub them carefully with a piece 
of fine sandpaper. 

" Pray, sir, do j'ou sell pies ?" said a gentleman, 
as he strolled into a pastry cook's shop. '' Oh 3'es, 
sir," replied the pastr}' cook, " pies of all sorts.'' 
" Wh}', then," said the gentleman, "let me have a 
mag-pie.''^ " That is the only sort of pie in which I 
do not deal," replied the pastry cook ; "but j'ou will 
find plenty of them as you go along, for birds of a 
feather will flock together, they say." 



TO CLEAN DECANTERS. 

670. The greatest care is necessary in 
cleaning decanters. There are several 
materials used for the purpose ; pounded 
egg-shells, wood ashes or sand, are all ob-

jectionable as being liable to scratch the 
glass ; some lukewarm soap suds, in which 
a little pearlash has been dissolved, and 
some very small pieces of raw potato 
thrown into the water will generally, when 
well shaken about, remove all the crust 
left on the sides ; a bottle brush, or a piece 
of sponge, tied to the end of a long piece 
of whalebone, may be used to finish the 
polish of the inside after it has been several 
times rinsed with cold water ; then brush 
the outside in a bowl of soap suds with a 
glass brush, rinse with cold water, drain 
in a rack for ten minutes, then dry the 
inside with a soft rag, tied to the end of a 
stick or whalebone, and the outside with 
the glass cloth, and leave the stopper out 
till the inside of the decanter is perfectly 
dry, as spots of mildew will entirely spoil 
it; if decanters are put by empty, a piece 
of paper should be put around the stopper 
to keep it from sticking, and to prevent 
the dust from getting into the bottle ; if 



THE Yor^a wife's cook v>nnx. ''>75 

they are put by with wine in them, it is 
well to take out the stopper and replace 
it with a cork, which preserves the wine 
better; decanters and bottles are often 
cleaned with shot; when this is done, care 
should be taken that no grain be left in 
tie bottle, as the lead and arsenic used in 
the manufacture of shot, when combined 
with the acid which exists in fermented 
liquors, form a dangerous poison. 

The more quietly and peaceably we get on, the 
better — the better for ourselves, the better for the 
neighbors. In nine cases out of ten, the wisest 
course is, if a man cheat you, to quit dealing with 
him ; if he be abusive, quit his company ; if he slan- 
ders you, take care to live so that nobody will be- 
lieve him. 



TO TAKE INK STAINS OUT OF MAHOGANY. 

671. Dilute half a teaspoonful of the oil 
of vitriol with a large spoonful of water, 
and touch the stain with a camel's hair 
brush. Rub it off quickly, and repeat the 
process until the spot disappears. 



576 THE rouNG wife's cook book. 

To attract customers, Fume has put up an Elec- 
tric Clock in his shop, and is terribly anno^'ed by 
boys running in to inquire the time of day. The 
other evening as we were buying a cigar, a little 
shaver came in with the usual " Please, sir, tell me 
what time it is." " Why, I told you the time not a 
minute ago," said the astonished tobacconist. " Yes, 
sir," re})iied the lad, "but this is for another 



TO KEMOVE FRESH INK FROM A CARPET. 

672. As soon as the ink has been 
spilled, take up as much as you can with a 
sponge, and then pour on cold water re- 
peatedly, still taking up the liquid ; next 
rub the place with a little wet oxalic acid 
or salt of sorrel, and wash it off immediately 
with cold water, then rub on some harts- 
horn. 

A CLERGYMAN, happening to get wet, was standing 
before the session-room fire to dry his clothes, and 
when his colleague came in, he asked him to preach 
for him as he was very wet. " No, sir, I thank 3'ou," 
was the prompt reply; "preach yourself — you will 
be dry enough in the pulpit." 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 5/7 

TO EEMOVE INK-SPOTS FROM WHITE 
CLOTHES. 

673. This must be done before the 
clothes are washed. Pick some tallow from 
the bottom of a clean mould candle, rub it 
hard on the ink-spots, and leave it sticking 
there in bits, till next day or longer. Then 
let the article be washed and boiled ; and if 
it is merely common ink, the stain will 
entirely disappear. Of course, this remedy 
can only be used for white things, as 
colored clothes cannot be boiled without en- 
tirely fading them. We know it to be effi- 
cacious. The tallow must be rubbed on 
cold. A most effective preparation for re- 
moving ink-spots may be made by the 
following receipt. An ounce each of sal- 
ammonia and salt of tartar well mixed, 
must be put into a quart bottle, a pint of 
cold soft water added to them, and ihe 
whole well shaken for a quarter of an hour. 
The bottle may be then filled with water, 

shaken a little longer, and corked. Wet

the marked linen effectually with this 
mixture, and repeat the process till the 
stains disappear. 

We know that men naturally shrink from the at- 
tempt to obtain companions who are their superiors ; 
but they will find that really intelligent women, who 
possess the most desirable qualities, are uniformly 
modest, and hold their charms in humble estimation. 
Don't imagine that any disappointment in love 
which takes place before you are twenty-one years 
old will be of any material damage to you. The 
truth is, that before a man is twent^^-five years old 
he does not himself know what he wants. The more 
of a man you become, and the more manliness you 
become capable of exhibiting in your association 
with women, the better wife you will be able to ob- 
tain ; and one year's possession of the heart and 
hand of a really noble woman is worth nine hundred 
and ninety-nine years' possession of a sweet crea- 
ture with two ideas in her head and nothing new to 
eay about either of them. 



ANOTHER METHOD OF REMOVING INK- 
SPOTS. 

674. Dissolve some oxalic acid in 
water, wet the spot with the liquid, and 
the stain will almost instantly disappear. 
Wash the linen immediately in clean water, 
or the acid will injure the fabric. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 579 

VARIOUS METHODS OF MENDING BROKEN 
ARTICLES. 

675. There are a great many cements 
by which broken glass and china may be 
joined, and the selection of one of these 
from among a number must mainly depend 
upon the transparency or color of the article 
to be mended, the nature of the fracture, 
and other considerations. 

It is an important rule in the use of all 
cements that only a small quantity should 
be employed ; and that, generally speaking, 
thin cements, judiciously applied, will unite 
articles more strongly than thick ones. 



TO JOIN GLASS THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN. 

676. Dissolve half an ounce of isinglass 
in a little spirits of wine, add a tablespoon- 
ful of water ; warm it slowly over the fire 
till it forms a transparent glue. Then 
spread it nicely on the edges of the broken 



680 THE YOUNG wife's cook book. 

glass, unite them, and in a few minutes 
the joining will be firm and scarcely per- 
ceptible. 



ANOTHER WAY TO JOIN BROKEN GLASS. 

677. Broken glass may be mended as 
follows : — Get some cloves of garlic, tie 
them in a rag, and place them in a tin pan, 
pounding them with a hammer, to express 
the juice. Wet the broken edges of the 
glass with this juice, and stick them firmly 
together ; stand the article upon a plate, or 
other level surface, and let it remain un- 
disturbed for a fortnight. 

Good and friendly conduct may meet with an un- 
worthy, with an ungrateful return ; but the absence 
of gratitude on the part of the receiver cannot de- 
stroy the self-approbation which recompenses the 
giver. And we may scatter the seeds of courtesy 
and kindness around us at so little expense. Some 
of them will inevitably fall on good ground, and 
grow up into benevolence in the mind of others, and 
all of them will bear fruit of happiness in the bosom 
whence they sprang. Once blest are all the virtues 
always ; twice blest sometimes. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 581 

CEMENT FOR BROKEN GLASS OR CHINA. 

678. China or glass may be mended 
as follows : — Slake some quicklime with 
boiled water, and collect some of the fine 
powder of the lime. Take the white of an 
egg and well beat it with an equal bulk of 
water, and add the slaked lime to it, so 
as to form a thin paste. It must be used 
speedily, and will be found to be very 
strong, and capable of resisting the action 
of boiling water. 



ANOTHER WAY TO MEND CHINA. 

679. Grind a piece of flint glass on a 
painter's stone to the very finest powder; 
rub it into a paste with the white of an egg^ 
and it will form a cement that will unite 
china so completely that it cannot be sepa- 
rated by any means. 

Cracked vessels of China earthenware, 
etc., such as chimney ornaments and vases. 



582 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

may be repaired by putting on the inside 
strips of tape, rubbed over with white 
lead. 



ANOTHER WAY TO MEND BROKEN CHINA. 

680. Make a very thick solution of 
gum-arabic in water, and stir into it plaster 
of Paris until the mixture becomes a thick 
paste. Apply it with a brush to the frac- 
tured edges, and stick them together. The 
whiteness of the cement renders it doubly 
valuable. 



GLUE FOR UNITING CARDBOARD, ETC. 

681. For uniting cardboard, paper, 
and small articles of fancy-work, the best 
glue, dissolved with about one third its 
weight of coarse brown sugar in the smallest 
quantity of boiling water, is very good. 
When this is in a liquid state, it may be 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 583 

dropped in a thin cake upon a plate, and 
allowed to dry. When required for use, 
one end of the cake may be moistened by 
the mouth, and rubbed on the substances 
to be joined. 



FLOUR PASTE. 



682. The uses of flour paste are very 
well known. But it will be found a great 
improvement to add a little alum to it 
before boiling; it will then work more 
freely, the particles of flour will not 
separate from the water, and it will unite 
surfaces much more firmly. 

A paste to resist the attacks of insects 
may be made by omitting the alum, and 
putting to each half pint of paste, fifteen 
grains of corrosive sublimate in powder, 
and well mixing it. This paste is poisonous. 

Men are frequently like tea ; the real strength 
and goodness are not properly drawn out of them 
till they have been a short time in hot water. 



584 THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 
RICE GLUE. 

683. Rice glue is a very delicate and 
suitable article for fancy work. Thoroughly 
mix rice flour with cold water, let it simmer 
gently over a slow fire. This is excellent 
for joining paper, etc., and if properly made 
and applied, the joining will be found very 
strong. When dry it is almost transparent. 



CEMENT FOR MENDING STONE, ETC. 
684. Mix in fine dry powder twenty 
parts of well washed and sifted sand, two 
of litharge, and one of freshly burned and 
slacked quicklime. This is suitable for fill- 
ing up cracks etc. It sets in a few hours, 
and has the appearance of light stone. 



MASTIC CEMENT. 

685. Mastic cement, or mastic glue, 
suitable for china, glass, the finer stones, 



THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 685 

marbles, or even for metals, is made as fol- 
lows : To one ounce of mastic, add as much 
highly rectiJfied spirits of wine as will dis- 
solve it. Soak an ounce of isinglass in 
water till quite soft, then dissolve it in pure 
rum or brandy until it forms a strong glue, 
to which add about a quarter of an ounce of 
gum ammoniac, well rubbed, and mixed. 
Put the two mixtures together in an earthen 
vessel over a gentle heat, and when well 
united, put into a small bottle and keep it 
well stopped. When wanted for use, the 
bottle must be set in warm water, and the 
china or glass articles must be warmed be- 
fore the cement is applied. The broken 
surfaces, when carefully fitted, should be 
kept in close contact for twelve hours at 
least, until the cement is fully set, after 
which the fracture will be as secure as any 
part of the vessel, and scarcely perceptible. 

A GENTLEMAN whose house was under repair, 
went one day to see how the job was getting on, 
and observing a quantity of nails lying about, said 



586 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

to a carpenter, " Why don't you take care of these 
nails, they'll certainly be lost ?" " No," repliea 
Master Chopstick, *' you'll JiJid them all in the hilV' 



TO MEND ALABASTER ORNAMENTS. 

686. As alabaster objects are composed 
of several parts, they are liable, from a 
variety of causes, to become disjoined, and 
when this occurs the parts may be rejoined 
by a cement made from the white of one 
egg mixed with a teaspoonful of quicklime. 
The cement should be used immediately 
that it is mixed, and the parts to be joined 
should be previously damped with luke- 
warm water. 



CEMENT FOR LEATHER. 

687. An adhesive material for joining 
leather, cloth, etc., is made as follows : 
Take one ounce of gutta percha, four ounces 
of India rubber, two ounces of pitch, one 



THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 587 

ounce of shellac, and two ounces of oil. 
Melt these ingredients together and use the 
mixture while hot. 

There is no policy like politeness ; and a good 
manner is the best thing in the world, either to get 
a good name or to supply the want of it. 



CEMENT FOR ALABASTER ORNAMENTS. 

688. Mix the white of one egg with a 
teaspoonful of quick lime. The parts to be 
joined should be dampened with lukewarm 
water, and the cement should be put on the 
moment it is mixed. 



CHEAP LOTION FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

689. Have a pot of strained honey on 
your wash-stand, and every time- you wash 
your hands, dip your loet finger into the 
honey and rub it over your hands while wet. 
Wipe them very dry and the skin will be 



588 THE YOUNG TTIFE^S COOK BOOK. 

soft even in the coldest weather. A few 
drops of glycerine rubbed on the hands 
daily will make them soft. 



METHOD OP WASHING THE HANDS. 

690. Take some dry Indian meal, wet 
your hands and rub them with it, then 
wash them with soap and tepid water. 
This is as good and much cheaper than 
sand soap. 

We never dreamed until lately that there was an 
aristocracy of appetites. We overheard in the mar- 
ket the following brief dialogue between an old lady 
and a little girl: " Mary," said the lady, " I should 
like to buy some of those cucumbers, if you will 
carry them home." " No, don't, granma !" " Why 
not ?" "Because I should be ashamed to be seen 
carr^^ing them home when everybody knows they're 
only a penny apiece.''^ 



PASTE FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

691. Mix a quarter of a pound of 
unsalted hog's lard, which has been washed 



THE YOUNG ^IFE's COOK BOOK. 589 

in water and then in rose-water, with the 
yolks of two new-laid eggs, and a large 
spoonful of honey. Add as much fine oat- 
meal, or almond paste, as will work into a 
paste. 

Make no expense but to do good to others or 
yourself, i. e., waste nothing. 



OINTMENT FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

692. Mix half an ounce of glycerine 
and two scruples of borax in half a pint of 
boiling water. Use morning and evening. 

*' To live much in a little time is, in a manner, as 
good as if the very time past were lived over again." 



RECEIPT FOR MAKING THE HANDS WHITE. 

693. In order to preserve the hands 
soft and white, they should always be 
washed in warm water with line soap, and 
carefully dried with a moderately coarse 
towel, being well rubbed every time to 



500 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

insure a brisk circulation, than which 
nothing can be more effectual in promo- 
ting a transparent and soft appearance. 
Almond paste is of essential use in pre- 
serving the delicacy of the hands. It is 
made thus : Blanch and beat up four ounces 
of bitter almonds ; add to them three ounces 
of lemon-juice, three ounces of almond oil, 
and a little weak spirits of wine. The 
following is a serviceable pomade for rub- 
bing the hands on retiring to rest : Take 
two ounces of sweet almonds, beat with 
three drachms of white wax, and three 
drachms of spermaceti; put up carefully 
in rose-water. 



WASH TO WHITEN THE NAILS. 

694. Tincture of myrrh, one drachm; 
diluted sulphuric acid, two drachms ; spring 
water, four ounces. Mix. First cleanse 
with white soap, then dip the finger into 
the wash. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 591 

Thunder and lightning are believed not to 
occur in the Arctic or Antarctic regions, beyond the 
seventy-fifth degree of north latitude ; and even as 
low as the seventieth degree these phenomena are 
very rare. 



CLEANSING THE HAIR. 

695. Nothing but good can be derived 
from a due attention to cleansing the hair. 
Of course, an immoderate use of water is 
not beneficial. Once a week is perhaps 
desirable, but this will depend upon the 
individual; persons with light, thin and 
dry hair will require it more seldom than 
those with thick, strong hair, or who 
perspire very freely. Nothing is better 
than soap and water. The soap should 
be mild, and well and plentifully rubbed 
in the hair. 

Bad Writing. — It is inexcusable in any one to 
write illegibly. When I was a schoolboy, I used to 
get hold of our writing-master's copies and trace 
them against the window ; hence the plain hand I 
now write. When the great Lord Clive was in India 
his sisters sent him some handsome presents from 



592 THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

England ; and he informed them by letter that he 
had returned them an '' elephanV^ (at least so they 
read the word). The announcement threw them 
into the utmost perplexity, — for what could they 
possibly do with the animal ? The word meant 
was " equivalent." 



TO CLEANSE AND PREVENT THE HAIR 
FROM FALLING OFF. 

696. Take two large handfuls of rose- 
mary leaves, a piece of common soda about 
the size of a hazel nut, and a drachm of 
camphor. Put it in a jug, pour on it a 
quart of boiling water, and cover it closely 
to keep the steam in. Let it stand for 
twelve hours, then strain it, and add a wine- 
glassful of rum. It is then ready for use. 
If the hair falls off much, the wash ought to 
be applied to the roots with a piece of 
sponge, every other day, taking care to wet 
the skin thoroughly. Then rub dry with a 
towel, brush well, and use only as much 
pomade as will keep down the short hairs, 
as the wash makes the hair soft and glossy. 



THE YOUN-G WIFE S COOK BOOK. 59 o 

This will keep good for several months in 
bottles well corked, and a piece of camphor 
in each. 

My hair and I are quits, d'ye see ? — 
I cut my hair — it now cuts me. 



A RECEIPT FOR POMADE. 

697. Three ounces of olive oil, three 
quarters of a drachm of the oil of almonds, 
two drachms of palm oil, half an ounce of 
white wax, a quarter of a pound of lard, 
and three quarters of a drachm of the 
essence of bergamot. 

A Thief Outwitted. — A young Englishman, 
whilst at Naples, was introduced at an assembly of 
one of the first ladies b}- a Neapolitan gentleman. 
While he was there his snuff box was stolen from 
him. The next day, being at another house, he saw 
a person taking snuff. He ran to his friend — - 
" There," said he, " that person in blue, with gold 
embroidery, is taking snuff out the box stolen from 
me yesterday. Do you know him ? Is he not a 
sharper ?" " Take care," said the other, " that is a 
gentleman of the first rank." " I don't care," said 
the Englisliman, " I must have my snuff box again. 
I'll go and ask him for it." " Pray," said his friend, 
37 



594 THE YOUNG THFE'S COOK BOOK. 

"be quiet, and leave the matter to me." Upon this 
assurance, the Englishman went away after inviting 
his friend to dine with him next day. He accord- 
ingly came, and as he entered — " There," said he, 
" 1 have brought you your snuff box." " Well, how 
did you obtain it?" " Why," said the Neapolitan 
nobleman, " I did not wish to make any noise about 
it, so I picked his pocket." 



CASTOR OIL CREAM FOR THE HAIR. 

698. Put half a pound of fresh lard 
into a basin, and pour a quart of boiling 
water over it ; stir it, that it may be well 
melted. When cold, take it off the water, 
Bqueeze it dry, and beat it with a wooden 
fork till in soft cream ; then add, by degrees, 
an ounce and a half of fresh castor oil and 
twenty-five drops of essential oil of berga- 
mot, or any other perfume preferred. Beat 
it till quite like a thick cream. Put it into 
covered toilet pots. 

Harbor not revenge in thy breast, it will torment 
thy heart, and discolor its best inclinations 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 595 

POMATUM FOR CHILDREN'S HAIR. 

699. Pick carefully and wash a quarter 
of a pound of beef-marrow ; put it into an 
earthen jar, with a quarter of a pound of 
fresh lard; stand it in boiling water till 
melted and clear; then strain it into a 
basin, add a gill of rose water. Stir it well, 
and let it get cold. Break it up and squeeze 
it through the rose water till it begins to be 
soft ; then press out the water, and beat it 
with a wooden fork ; add one ounce of pure 
olive oil, and half an ounce of violet-scented 
oil. Beat till it is quite smooth, and put it 
into covered toilet pots. (The mixing of 
every kind of pomatum had better be done 
in a cool place; more particularly when 
castor oil is used.) 

Red-tape Routine. — By a singular regulation 
the government couriers in Austria are ordered, 
when charged with despatches, sealed with only one 
seal, to go at a walking pace ; if with two seals, to 
trot ; and if with three, to gallop. A courier, bear- 
ing a despatch with three seals, passing lately 
through a garrison town, was requested by the 
commandant to take a despatch to the next towD* 



596 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

To this he willingly agreed, but perceiving that it 
had only one seal, he refused to take charge of it, 
saying, that the regulations ordered him to walk 
his horse with such a despatch, and as he had an- 
other with which he was ordered to gallop, he could 
not possibly take both of them. 



CHILDREN'S CURLS. 

700. If the hair be soft and fine, try 
brushing it with a brush dipped slightly in 
spirits of hartshorn ; or melt a bit of white 
wax the size of a nut-kernel, in an ounce of 
olive oil, and dress the hair in curls with it. 

Hath any one wronged thee ? be bravely revenged. 
Slight it, and the work has begun ; forgive it, and 
it is finished. 



CTJRLING FLUID, FOR THE HAIR. 

701. Melt a piece of white beeswax 
about the size of a filbert in an ounce of 
olive oil, and add one or two drops of otto 
of roses.

BANDOLINE. 

702. An ounce of the seed of quinces 
must be boiled in three pints of water till 
reduced half, then strain it, and add a few 
drops of essence to perfume it. Keep it 
in wide-mouthed, well-corked bottles. 



ANOTHER KIND OF BANDOLINE. 

703. Boil a quarter of an ounce of Irish 
moss in one quart of water. When suffi- 
ciently thick, bottle it, and put a teaspoonful 
of rectified spirits in each bottle to prevent 
mildew. 



LIP SALVE. 

704. Take two ounces of oil of sweet 
almonds, half an ounce of white wax, and 
half an ounce of rose-water ; cut the wax 
into small pieces, put them in a mortar, and 



598 THE YOUNG THFE's COOK BOOK. 

set the mortar in a vessel of boiling water. 
When the wax has melted, take out the 
mortar, and add the oil by degrees, beating 
the pestle until it is cool ; mix the rose-water 
with the mass. To color it, rub a little 
camiine with the oil before mixing it with 
the wax. A little beeswax melted in sweet 
oil, makes a cheap lip salve. 

Endeavor to be first in thy calling whatever it 
be, neither let any one go before thee in well-doing ; 
nevertheless, do not envy the merits of another, but 
improve thine own talents. 



ESSENCE OF JESSAMINE. 

705. .This is obtained in the following 
way : A layer of flowers is spread over the 
bottom of a hair sieve, and upon the flower 
is laid a layer of small and detached bits 
of the finest cotton wool, which have been 
dipped in oil of Ben — that oil being prefera- 
ble to any other, as it does not become ran- 
cid. Over the cotton is laid another layer 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 599 

of flowers, and so on alternately cotton and 
flowers, until the sieve is full. When these 
have lain twenty-four hours, the flowers 
are removed and fresh ones introduced, a 
process repeated until the cotton is quite im- 
pregnated with the odor. The oil is then 
pressed out of the cotton. Add to it some 
highly rectified spirits of wine, and keep 
it in closely stopped bottles. The jonquil 
rose, or heliotrope, may be served in the 
same way. 



TO MAKE A SCENT JAR. 

706. Gather rose leaves on a fine day, 
lay them in a broad mouthed jar, and 
sprinkle a little common salt over each 
layer of leaves. Lavender blossoms or any 
sweet-scented flowers may be added. Strew 
over the whole, a little bay salt, well 
pounded, some orris root, sliced, cloves, 
cinnamon, and angelica root, sliced. Mix the 
ingredients and cover the jar close. 



600 THE YOUNG TTIFE S COOK BOOK. 

No young man reallj believes he shall ever die. 
There is a feeling of eternity in youth which makes 
us amends for every thing. Death, old age, are 
words without a meaning — a dream, a fiction. To 
be young is to be as one of the immortals. 



BOUaUET DE LA REINE. 

707. A highly fragrant and much 

esteemed perfume for the handkerchief, etc., 

compounded as follows : Oils of bergamot 

and lavender, of each, thirty drops; neroli, 

fifteen drops; oils of verbena and cloves, 

of each, five drops ; essence of musk, 

ambergris, and jasmine, of each, half a 

drachm ; rectified spirit of wine, two ounces; 

mix. 

If you woo the company of angels in 3'our waking 
hours, they will be sure to come to you in your 
sleep. 



HONEY SOAP. 

708. Cut into thin shavings, two 
pounds of common yellow or white soap; 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 601 

set it over the fire with just enough water 
to k'iep it from burning ; when quite melted, 
add a quarter of a pound of honey, and stir 
the mixture till it boils; then take it off 
and add a few drops of any agreeable per- 
fume ; pour it into a deep dish to cool. 

Take care always to form your establishment so 
much within your income as to leave a sufficient 
fund for unexpected contingencies and a prudent 
liberality. There is hardly a day in any man's life 
in which a small sum of ready money may not be 
employed to great advantage. 



VIOLET PERFUME. 

709. Drop twelve drops of oil of rho- 
dium on a piece of loaf sugar, grind this 
well in a glass mortar, and mix it tho- 
roughly with three pounds of orris-root 
powder. This will resemble the perfume 
of violet. If more oil of rhodium be added, 
a rose perfume, instead of violet, will be 
produced. 

Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes or 
habitation. 



602 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
WHITEWASH THAT WILL NOT RUB OFF. 
710. Slake the lime in the usual way. 
Mix one gill of flour with a little cold 
water, taking care to beat out all the 
lumps ; then pour on it boiling water enough 
to thicken it to the consistency of common 
starch when boiled for use. Pour it while 
hot into a bucket of the slaked lime, and 
add one pound of whiting. Stir all well 
together. A little ^^blue water," made by 
squeezing the indigo bag, or a little pulver- 
ized indigo mixed with water, improves it. 

A Frenchman being afflicted with the gout, was 
asked what difference there was between that and 
the rheumatism. " One very great deferance !" 
replied Monsieur. " Suppose you take one vice, 
you put your finger in, you turn de screw till you 
bear him no longer — dat is the rheumatis — den, 
spose you give him one turn more, dat is de gout.^' 



ENDS OF CANDLES CONVERTED INTO 
NIGHT LIGHTS. 

711. Supposing a few night lights to be 
wanted in places where they cannot be pro- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 603 

cured, they may be made from the ends of 
candles in the following manner. Collect a 
few old pill-boxes ; make as many fine cotton 
wicks as you have boxes, and wax the cot- 
ton with beeswax ; cut them to the re- 
quisite length, and fix them in the centre of 
the boxes, through a pin-hole in the bottom. 
Melt the grease (if mixed with a little wax 
the better) and fill the boxes, keeping the 
cotton in a central position while the grease 
cools. When set to burn, place the box in 
a saucer, with sufficient water to surround 
the bottom, about the sixteenth of an inch 
in depth. 

We have heard of a would-be wit who kept a 
Dutmeg-grater on his table, in order to say when a 
great man was mentioned, " There's a greater J^ 



THE TURKISH BATH UPON A SMALL 
SCALE. 

712, Place the patient upon a large 
cane-bottomed chair, and tie a large blan- 



604 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

ket around his neck, so as to completely 
envelope the chair and his body ; under- 
neath the chair, place a saucer full of 
alcohol (spirits of wine) and set a light to 
it. The space within the blanket will soon 
be filled with hot air, and a profuse per- 
spiration will be produced. 



A SIMPLE METHOD OF CATCHING AND 
DESTKOYING FLIES. 

713. Take some jars, mugs, or tumblers, 
fill them half full with soapy water ; cover 
them as jam-pots are covered, with a piece 
of paper, either tied down or tucked under 
the rim. Let this paper be rubbed inside 
with wet sugar, molasses, honey, or jam, or 
any thing sweet, cut a small hole in the 
centre, large enough for a fly to enter. The 
flies settle on the top, attracted by the smell 
of the bait ; they then crawl through the 
hole, to feed upon the sweet beneath. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 605 

Meanwhile the warmth of the weather 
causes the soapy water to ferment, and pro- 
duces a gas which overpowers the flies, and 
they drop down into the vessel. Thousands 
may be destroyed this way, and the traps 
last a long time. 



TINCTURE OF NUTMEG. 

714-. A very useful tincture of nutmeg, 
ready for immediate use, may be made by 
adding three ounces of bruised or grated 
nutmeg to a quart of brandy. A smaller 
quantity may be made, by observing the 
same proportions. This will be a very 
grateful addition to all compounds in which 
nutmeg is used ; a few drops will suffice to 
impart a flavor. 

" The candles you sold me last were very bad," 
said Suett, to a tallow-chandler. " Indeed, sir, I 
am sorry for that." "Yes, sir, do you know that 
they burnt to the middle, and would then hum no 
longer.''^ "You surprise me ; what, sir, did they go 
out?" "No, sir, no J they burnt shorter.''^

TO PREVENT THE BREAKAGE OF LAMP 

CHIMNEYS. 

715. Every housewife who uses kero- 
sene oil, knows that it affords the best and 
cheapest light of all illuminating oils. But 
she also knows that the constant expense 
and annoyance from the breakage of lamp 
chimneys, almost if not quite counterbal- 
ances the advantages of its use. Put the 
glass chimney in lukewarm water, heat it to 
the boiling point, and boil it one hour; after 
which leave it in the water till it cools. 
The chimney will be less liable to crack by 
sudden changes of temperature. 



TO PREPARE FEATHERS FOR BEDS. 

716. Feathers should be put into bags 
of brown paper as soon as they are plucked ; 
the goose feathers, which are the most 
valuable, should always be kept separate 
from those of the ducks or chickens; the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 607 

feathers must be picked carefully that no 
flesh or skin adhere to them, and the 
pinions and large feathers must be stripped 
from the quills, which must be kept from 
the feathers. The bags must be kept hung 
in a warm place. If the kitchen be lofty, 
and they can be suspended from the ceiling 
without inconvenience, they will soon be- 
come perfectly dry there. As soon as a 
sufficient quantity of feathers have been 
collected, it is the best plan to fill a pillow 
with them ; the goose feathers can afterward 
be transferred to a bed-tick ; the feathers of 
fowls being commonly used for pillows. Old 
feathers may be greatly improved by empty- 
ing the tick, (which should also be washed,) 
and washing them through several lathers 
of strong soapsuds, rinse them well in cold 
water, drain them on sieves, and spread 
them to dry on the floor of an empty garret; 
their drying may be accelerated by sewing 
them in a coarse sheet, and putting them 
into the oven on a baking day, after the 



608 THE YOUNG wife's COOK BOOK. 

Dread is drawn, and letting them remain 
there till next morning, this should be 
several times repeated, then put them into 
bags and beat them. 

Bridget, just arrived from sweet Erin, and 
snugly ensconced ; with a genteel family as maid of 
all work, sat down to her first meal. Having dimin- 
ished the substantials, she came to an apple-pie. 
It was something entirely new to her. She viewed 
it from all quarters, and examined it very minutel3% 
She then removed the upper-crust and commenced 
eating the apple, carefully scraping it from the

A little startled, Bridget looked up, and exclaimed.

BEDS FOR THE POOR. 

717. Beech leaves are recommended for 
this purpose, as they are very elastic, and 
will not harbor vermin. They should be 
gathered on a dry day in the autumn, and 
be perfectly dried. 

The chaff of newly-thrashed oats also 
forms wholesome and comfortable beds.

A Yankee sitting on a very hard seat in a rail- 
way carriage, said, " Wal, they tell me these here

TO REMOVE THE TASTE OF NEW WOOD. 

718. A new keg, churn, bucket, or 
other wooden vessel, will generally com- 
municate a disagreeable taste to any thing 
that is put into it. To prevent this incon- 
venience, first scald the vessel well with 
boiling water, letting the water remain in 
it till cold. Then dissolve some pearlash, 
or soda, in luke-warm water, adding a little 
bit of lime to it, and wash the inside of the 
vessel well with this solution. Afterward, 
scald it well with plain hot water, and rinse 
it with cold before you use it. 

A PARISH oflScial, of sedate manners, fell on the 
pavement, during a frost, for the sufficient reason 
that he was intoxicated. Turning to the bystanders, 
he asked. "Are our by-laws to be enforced or not, I 
should like to know ? Why donH you spread ashes 
before yovr houses .'"

TO REMOVE GHEASE SPOTS. 

719. Magnesia will effectually remove 
grease spots from silk on rubbing it in well ; 
and after standing awhile, apply a piece of 
soft brown paper to the wrong side, on 
which press a warm iron gently ; and what 
grease is not absorbed by the paper, can be 
removed by washing the spot carefully with 
w^arm water. 

Consider how few things are worthy of anger, 
and thou wilt wonder that any fools should be 
wroth. 



TO SCOUR BOARDS. 

720. Mix lime, one part; sand, three 
parts ; soft soap, two parts. Lay a little on 
the boards with a scrubbing brush, and rub 
thoroughly. Be careful to clean straight up 
and down — not crossing from board to 
board ; then dry with clean cloths, rubbing 
hard up and down the same way. Floors 
ghould not often be wetted, but very 



THE YOUNG WIFF/s COOK BOOK. 611 

thoroughly when done ; and once a week 
they may be dry-rubbed with hot sand and 
a heavy brush — the right way of the boards. 



TO POLISH ALABASTER ORNAMENTS. 

721. First carefully clean the article 
with a piece of pumice stone dipped in 
water; then apply a thick paste made of 
whiting, soap and milk; and when this is 
perfectly done, wash the article thoroughly, 
dry it with a soft cloth, and rub with a flan- 
nel until the polish is produced. 

Zeal without knowledge is fire without light. 



TO IMITATE ALABASTER. 

722. Alabaster ornaments may be 
imitated by brushing over plaster of Paris 
models with spermaceti, white wax, or a 
mixture of the two, or by steeping the 



612 THE YOUNG WIFES COOK BOOK. 

models in the warm mixture. Or instead 
of this process, they may be brushed over 
several times with white of egg, allowing 
each coating sufficient time to dry. Only 
models made of the finest plaster are suited 
for these processes. 



USES OF COAL ASHES. 

723. They are said to prevent the 
depredations of garden mice if spread over 
the surface of the mould. Coal ashes are 
said to accelerate the appearance of early 
sown peas. Strew the surface of the ground 
with coal ashes as soon as the peas are put 
in the ground, and they will appear three 
or four days earlier than when no ashes are 
spread. 

There is nothing in the universe more desirable 
than a free mind. So long as a man has this, he 
has that which nothing can subdue, he has that 
which nothing can subvert, he has that which ren- 
ders him a monarch, though he may lie down upon 
the bare cold bosom of his mother earth. 



THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 613 

CHEAP SOAP. 

724. Cut two pounds of common brown 
soap into thin slices, to which add one ounce 
of borax and ten quarts of water. Put the 
whole over the fire, and when the soap and 
borax are dissolved the soap is done. It re- 
quires but little time and trouble to make 
this soap, which is very valuable for wash- 
ing dishes, cleaning paint, scrubbing floors, 
etc. It is, moreover, very healing to the 
hands. K less water is used, the soap will 
be harder. 

Good temper is the philosophy of the heart — a 
gem of the treasury within, whose rays are reflec- 
ted on all outward objects ; a perpetual sunshine, 
imparting warmth, light, and life to all within the 
spheres of its influence. 



TO PREVENT RUST. 

725. Mix with fat oil varnish, four fifths 
of well rectified spirits of turpentine. The 
varnish is to be applied by means of a 



614 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

sponge. Articles varnished in this man- 
ner will retain their metallic brilliancy and 
never contract any spots of rust. It may be 
applied to copper, and to the preservation 
of philosophical instruments, which, by 
being brought into contact with water, are 
liable to lose their splendor and become 
tarnished. 

Like his counterpart Shakspeare, Sir Walter 
Scott was much given to punning. Among a thou- 
sand instances of this propensity in the latter, we 
record one. A friend borrowing a book one day, 
Sir Walter put it into his hands with these words : 
" Now, I consider it necessary to remind 3'ou, that 
this volume should be soon returned ; for, trust me, 
I find that although many of my friends are bad 
arithmeticians, almost all of them are good book- 
keeper s^ 



TO EEMOVE SCORCH MARKS. 

726. If linen has been scorched and the 
mark has not penetrated entirely through 
so as to damage the texture, it may be re- 
moved by the following process : peel and 



THE YOUNG WTFES COOK BOOK. 615 

slice two onions, and extract the juice by 
squeezing or pounding. Then cut up half 
an ounce of white soap, add two ounces of 
fuller's earth, and mix them with the onion 
juice and half a pint of vinegar. Boil this 
composition well ; then spread it, when cool, 
over the scorched part of the linen, and let 
it dry on. Afterward, wash out the linen, 
and the mark will be found to have been 
removed. 

The reason why policemen are never run over is, 
they are never in the way. 



SAVING OF FUEL. 



727. The grate or cavity for the recep- 
tion of coal, should never be filled more 
than three parts full at one time. The fuel 
ignites more thoroughly, and a greater 
amount of heat is thrown out by a given 
amount of coal.

" The fire is going out, Miss Filkins." " I know 
it, Mr. Green; and if you would act wisel^y, you 
would follow its example." It is unnecessary to 
add, that Green never came to see that young lady 
again. 



TO WASH BLOND LACE. 

728. The French blond lace may be 
washed by sewing it round a bottle, as in 
the direction for thread lace on page 618. 
Then place the bottle upright in a strong 
lather of white soap and clear soft water. 
Set it in the sun, and rub the lace gently 
with your hands. Kepeat the process every 
day for a week, keeping it in the sun, and 
rubbing the lace gently , every time the 
lather is renewed. Then unfold the lace 
from the bottle, and pin it on a large pillow 
or cushion tightly, using a separate pin for 
every scallop, and placing it very straight 
and even. Let it dry perfectly on the 
pillow; then unpin and take it off; but 
do not starch, iron, or press it; fold it 
loosely and put it by.

How many a man by throwing himself to the 
ground in despair, destroys forever a thousand 
flowers of hope that were ready to spring up along 
his pathway. 



TO TAKE OUT MILDEW FROM LINEN, No. 1. 

729. Two tablespoonfuls of soft soap 
and the juice of a lemon. Lay it on the 
spots with a brush, on both sides of the 
linen. Let it lie a day or two till the stains 
disappear. 

The Prince of Gentlemen. — " Here, you bog- 
trotter," said a coxcomb, with a patronizing air, 
"come and tell me the greatest lie you can, and I'll 
treat 3'ou to a jug of whisky punch." " On my 
word," answered Barney, " yer honor's a gintleman !" 



TO TAKE OUT MILDEW FROM LINEN, No. 2. 

730. Take soap and rub it well ; then 
scrape some fine chalk, and rub that also in 
the linen ; lay it on the gratis ; as it dries, 
wet it a little, and it will come out at 
once. 



618 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

Men often talk of the humbleness of their origin 
when they are really ashamed of it, though vain of 
the talent that enabled them to emerge from it. 



TO WASH THREAD LACE. 

731. Having ripped the lace from the 
article to which it was attached, and care- 
fully picked out the loose bits of thread, roll 
the lace very smoothly and securely round 
a clean black bottle, which has been covered 
with new white linen, sewed on tightly. 
Tack each end of the lace with a needle and 
thread, to keep it smooth ; and in wrapping 
it round the bottle, take care not to crumple 
or fold in any of the scollops or pearlings. 
Pour into a saucer a very little of the best 
sweet oil, and, dipping in your finger, touch 
it lightly on the lace while proceeding to 
wind it on the bottle — too much oil will 
make it greasy. Have ready a wash kettle, 
a strong, cold lather made of very clear 
water, and white Castile soap. Having 



THE YOUNG WIFe'S COOK BOOK. 619 

filled the bottle with cold water to keep it 
from bursting, set it upright in the suds, 
and tie a string round the neck, securing it 
to the ears or handle of the kettle, to pre- 
vent its knocking about and breaking while 
over the fire. Let it boil in the suds for an 
hour or more, or till the lace is clean and 
white all through. Then take it out, drain 
ofi" the suds, and set the bottle in the sun, 
for the lace to dry on it. When it is quite 
dry, remove the lace from the bottle, and 
roll it round a wide ribbon block, if you 
have one ; otherwise, lay it in long folds, 
place it within a sheet of smooth white 
paper, and press it in a large book for a day 
or two. By this simple process, in which 
there is neither rinsing, starching, nor iron- 
ing, the lace will acquire the same consis- 
tence, transparency, and tint that it had 
when new, and the scollops at the edge will 
come out perfectly even. We can safely 
recommend this as the best possible method 
of doing up thread lace, and as the only one 



620 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

which gives it a truly new appearance. It 
is well not to put the oil on the lace till you 
have the soapsuds ready in the kettle, so 
that the bottle may go in immediately ; as 
if allowed to stand, much of the oil will run 
down and drip off. 



TO CLEAN WHITE FEATHERS. 

732. Draw the feathers gently through 
a warm soap lather several times, then pass 
them through tepid, and finally through cold 
water, to rinse them. Then hold them a 
short distance from the fire, and curl the 
separate parts of the feather as it dries by 
holding a steel knitting pin in the hand, 
and drawing each portion of the feather 
briskly between the pin and the thumb. 

The purest, coldest maxims are poured down on 
us from pulpits, and authors, like flakes of snow ; 
but fast as they fall thej^ do not prevent the volcano 
of our passions from burning. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 621 

TO TAKE OUT WAX. 

733. Hold a very hot iron near, but 
not on, the spot, till the wax melts. Then 
scrape it off. Lay a clean blotting paper 
over the place, and press it with a cooler 
iron till the wax has disappeared. 



TO SELECT FLOOR OIL CLOTHS. 

734. The best floor cloths are those 
painted on fine cloth, which should be well 
covered with color. If the figures rise much 
above the ground, they soon wear off. The 
durability of the cloth will depend much on 
the time the paint has been allowed to dry, 
as well as on the quality of the colors used. 
If the paint has not become sufficiently 
hardened, a very little use will deface the 
cloth. Old carpets answer very well for 
common floor cloths, if they are painted 
well and seasoned some months before they 
are laid down. 



622 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

TO CURL FEATHERS. 

735. Heat them gently before the fire ; 
then with the back of a knife applied to the 
feather, they will curl well and quickly. 
White feathers may be perfectly cleaned by 
washing in soft water with white soap and 
a squeeze of blue ; beat them against clean 
white paper, shake gently for a few minutes 
before the fire, then dry them in the air, 
and afterward curl them. Or, hold the 
feathers before a bright fire, and draw the 
back of a knife along the back of the feathers 
and they will curl again. 

Clever Stupidity. — " James, my son, take this 
letter to the Post Office, and pay the postage.'' The 
boy returned highly elated, and said : " Father, I 
seed a lot of men putting letters in a little place, and 
when no one was looking, I slipped yours in for 
nothing." 



FOR TOOTHACHE. 
736. Take of choloform, spirits of cam- 
phor, and laudanum, each one drachm. 
Apply on a little cotton wool. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 623 

TO OBLITERATE WRITING. 

737. Recently written matter may be 
completely removed by oxymuriatic acid 
(concentrated and in solution). Wash the 
written paper repeatedly with acid, and 
afterward wash it with lime water, to neu- 
tralize any acid which may be left. The 
writing will be thus removed. If the writing 
is old, the preceding process will not be suf- 
ficiently efficacious, owing to the change 
which the ink has undergone. In such a 
case, the writing must be washed with sul- 
phate of ammonia, before the oxymuriatic 
acid is applied. It may then be washed 
with a hair pencil. 

A YOUNG divine, who was much given to enthusi- 
astic cant, one da}^ said to Dr. Laythorpe, " Do 5^ou 
suppose that you have any real religion ?" " None 
to apeak of " was the excellent reply. 



TO KEEP SILK. 

738. Silk articles should not be kept 
folded in white paper, as the chloride of lime 



624 THE YOUNG VTIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

used in bleaching the paper will probably 
impair the color of the silk. Brown paper 
is better ; the yellowish smooth India paper 
is best of all. 



TO RAISE THE CRUSH PILE OF VELVET. 

739. Hold the wrong side of the velvet 
over boiling water, and the pile of velvet 
will be gradually raised. 



CEMENT FOR BOTTLE CORKS. 

740. Melt yellow wax with an equal 
quantity of resin, or of common turpentine 
resin, to which add, when thoroughly 
mixed, one part of Venetian red, well 
dried. While warm, dip the neck of the 
bottle in so as to cover the cork and edge 
of the bottle with the wax. 



THE YOUNG T^^IFE's COOK BOOK. 625 
TO DRIVE AWAY MTJSaTJITOES. 

741. A camphor bag hung up in an 
open casement will prove an effectual bar- 
rier to their entrance. Camphorated spirits 
applied as perfume to the face and hands 
will prove an effectual preventive ; but 
when bitten by them, aromatic vinegar is 
the best antidote. 



TO IMPROVE GILDING. 

742. Mix a gill of water with two 
ounces of purified nitre, one ounce of alum, 
and one ounce of common salt. Lay this 
over gilt articles with a brush, and their 
color will be much improved. 



CHEAP SIMPLE CERATE. 

743. Four parts lard, two parts white 
wax, and two parts spermaceti.

626 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

TO KEEP BREAD. 

744. When bread is perfectly cold it 
should be laid into a large covered earthen 
pan ; this should be kept free from crumbs, 
frequently scalded, and then wiped dry for 
use. Loaves which have been cut should 
have a small pan appropriated to them, and 
this also should have the loose crumbs 
wiped from it daily. The bread pans, in- 
stead of standing on the floor, should be 
placed upon a proper stand or frame made 
for the purpose, by means of two flat wedges 
of wood, so as to allow a current of air to 
pass under them. 

As the whirlwind in its fury teareth np trees and 
deformeth the face of nature ; or as an earthquake 
in its convulsions overturneth whole cities, so the 
rage of an angry man throweth mischief around 
him ; danger and destruction wait on his hand. 



USE OF SOOT. 



745. Peas may be preserved from 
destruction by mice by sowing soot with 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 627 

them ; and when the peas come up, if soot 
be sprinkled over them while they are 
damp, birds will not touch them. Soot is 
also invaluable for carnations and tulips in 
any ground where wire-worms abound. It 
is not only a destroyer of insects, but a rich 
manure. 

A chimney-sweeper's boy went into a baker's 
shop for a two penny loaf, and conceiving it to be 
diminutive in size, remarked to the baker that he 
did not believe it was weight. " Never mind that,'* 
said the man of dough, " you will have the less to 
carry." " True," replied the lad, and throwing two 
cents on the counter, left the shop. The baker 
called after him, saying that he had not left money 
enough. "Never mind that," said young Sooty, 
"you will have the less to count." 



TO OBTAIN HERBS OF THE FINEST FLAVOR. 
746. When herbs are to be kept for 
flavoring dishes, it is obviously of the first 
importance that they should be gathered 
at the right time and dried in the best 
manner. 
^ Herbs should be gathered just before 



628 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

they begin to flower, on a dry day, before 
the sun has been long upon them. When 
intended for preservation they should be 
cleaned from dirt and dust, and dried 
gradually in a cool oven. The leaves 
should then be picked off, pounded in a 
mortar, passed through a hair sieve, and 
the powders be preserved separately in well- 
stopped bottles. 

The newspapers are full of advertisements of 
plain cooks. Pretty cooks have no occasion to 
advertise. 



TO REMOVE GLASS STOPPERS. 

747. When the stopper of a glass 
decanter is too tight, a cloth wet with hot 
water, and applied to the neck, will cause 
the glass to expand, and the stopper may 
be removed. In a phial the warmth of 
the finger may be sufficient. 

Nothing can be more touching than to behold a 
soft and tender woman, who had been all weakness 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 629 

and dependence while treading the prosperous paths 
of life, suddenly rising in mental force to be the 
comforter and supporter of her husband under mis- 
fortunes. As the vine which has long twined its 
graceful foliage about the oak, and been lifted by it 
into sunshine, will when the hardy tree is rifted by 
the thunder-bolts, cling round it with its caressing 
tendrils, and bind up its shattered boughs, so woman, 
who is the dependent and ornament of man in his 
happier hours, should be his stay and solace when 
smitten with sudden calamity. 



TO RESTORE BLACK CRAPE. 
748. Make scalding hot skim-milk and 
water, with a small piece of glue in it. 
Immerse faded and rusty black crape in 
this for a few minutes ; then take it out. 
clasp it in the hands and pull it dry, and 
it will look equal to new. 



RED, WHITE, OR BLACK VARNISH FOR 
BASKETS. 

749. Pulverize either red, white, or 
black sealing wax, sift it, put it in a phial 



630 THE YOUNG TTIFF/S COOK BOOK. 

with enough spirits of wine to just cover 
it. Stand it in a very warm place for a 
couple of days, when it will be ready for 
use. 

*'When thou seest the naked wanderer of the 
street, shivering with cold, and destitute of habita- 
tion, let bounty open thine heart, let the wings of 
charity shelter him from death, and thine own soul 
may live." 



MEANS OF DOUBLING A CROP OF POTATOES 
WITHOUT INCREASED EXPENDITURE. 

750. A double crop of potatoes may 
be obtained by pursuing the following 
course : when the potatoes have come to 
maturity, take off the loose earth carefully 
without disturbing the old stem ; pick away 
the tubers that are fit for immediate use ; 
be careful not to disturb the main stalk, 
then cover over the small ones that are left, 
and add a little more earth. In about two 
months after, the latter crop will be more 
productive than the first. 



THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 631 

" Papa, I planted some potatoes in our garden," 
said one of the smart lads of this generation, " and 
what do you think came up ?" " Why., potatoes, of 
course." " No, indeed, there came up a drove of 
hogs and eat them allP^ 



THE ECONOMY OF DRIPPING-MEANS OF 
SAVING THE CONSUMPTION OF BUTTER. 

751. Well clarified dripping, when 
fresh and sweet, will baste every thing as 
well as butter, and should supply the place 
of butter for common pies, etc., for which 
it is equal to lard, especially if the clarify- 
ing be repeated twice over. If kept in a 
cool place, it may be preserved a fortnight 
in summer, and longer in winter. 

To clarify dripping, put it into a clean 
saucepan, over a stove or slow fire; as soon 
as a scum forms, skim it well, let it boil, 
let it stand till it is a little cooled, then 
pour it through a sieve into a pan. 

After frying, let the spare dripping stand 
a few minutes to settle, and then pour it 



632 THE YOUNG wife's COOK BOOK. 

through a sieve into a clean basin or stone 
pan, and it will do a second and a third 
time as well as it did the first ; but the fat 
in which fish has been fried, must not be 
used for a.iay other purpose than frying 
other fish. 

Why is hot bread like a caterpillar ? Because it 
is the grub that makes the butter Jiy ? 



TO PREVENT MOTH. 
752. The cuttings of Russia leather 
placed with furs, blankets, cloth, etc., will 
efiectually prevent moth. Camphor is also 
a good thing. The article must be kept in 
a dry place, and free from dust. 



TO KILL MOTHS IN CARPETS. 
753. Wring a coarse cloth out of clean 
water, spread it smoothly on the part of the 
carpet where moths are suspected to be; 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 633 

with a hot iron send the steam from the 
wet cloth into the carpet. This process 
will not injure the pile of the carpet, if the 
iron is not pressed on too heavily. It is 
necessary to destroy the moth as well as 
the eggs. 



LiaUID GLUE. 
754. Take a wide-mouthed bottle, and 
dissolve in it eight ounces of the best glue 
in half a pint of water, by setting it in a 
vessel of water, and heating until dissolved. 
Then add, slowly, two and a half ounces of 
strong aqua fortis (nitric acid), stirring all 
the while. Keep it well corked, and it will 
be ready for use at any moment. This 
preparation does not gelatinize, nor undergo 
putrefaction nor fermentation. It is appli- 
cable for many domestic uses, such as 
mending china, repairing cabinet work, etc. 

Recently, a clergyman, while announcing from 
Ms pulpit an appointment for the ladies of his con- 



634 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

gregation to meet at the Orphan's Asylum, on a 
beneficiar}'' visit to the institution, closed the an- 
nouncement with the following words: " The ladies 
will take with them their own refreshments, so as 
not to eat up the orphans." 



WATERPROOF LEATHER BOOTS THAT WILL 
RESIST THE SEVEREST WEATHER. 

755. Take half a pint of linseed oil, 

and half a pint of neat's foot oil, and boil 

them together. Have the boots dry, and 

free from dirt, rub them well with this 

mixture before the fire, until completely 

saturated; set them by for two or three 

days after oiling the first time ; and after 

using, wash them clean from dirt, and oil 

when dry; or upon the feet, before going 

out. The soles of dress boots may be made 

impervious to wet or snow, by the same 

mixture. 

The Rev. Dr. M was reputed for the suavity 

of his manners and his especial politeness toward 
the fair sex Handing a dish of honey to a lady, 
at a party at his house, he said in his wonted man- 
ner, "Do take a little honey. Miss ; 'tis so 

sweet, so like 3'ourself " A Mr. Muddle, handing 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 635 

the butter dish to the host, exclaimed, "Do take a 
little butter, doctor ; 'tis so like yourself." 



YEAST CAKES, OR PRESERVED YEAST. 
756. Put a large handful of hops into 
two quarts of boiling water. Boil three 
large potatoes until they are tender. Mash 
them and add to them two pounds of flour. 
Pour the boiling hop water over the flour 
through a sieve or colander, and beat it 
until it is quite smooth. While it is warm, 
add two tablespoonfuls of salt, ' and half a 
teacupful of sugar. Before it is quite cold, 
stir in a pint or more of good yeast. After 
the yeast has become quite light, stir in as 
much Indian meal as it will take, roll it 
out in cakes, and place them on a cloth in 
a dry place, taking care to turn them every 
day. At the end of a week or ten days 
they may be put into a bag, and should be 
kept in a dry place. When used, take one 
of these cakes, soak it in some milk-warm

water, mash it up smooth, and use it as any 
other kind of yeast. 

" William," said a teacher to one of his pupils, 
" can you tell me Tvhy the sun rises in the east?" 
" Don't know, sir," replied William, " 'cept it be 
that east makes every thing rise." 



DEAFNESS IN OLD PERSONS. 
757. This is usually accompanied with 
confused sounds, and noises of various 
kinds in the inside of the ear itself. In 
such cases, insert a piece of cotton wool, 
on which a very little oil of cloves or cin- 
namon has been dropped, or which has 
been dipped in equal parts of aromatic spirit 
of ammonia and tincture of lavender. The 
ear trumpet ought likewise to be occasion- 
ally used. 

How lamentable that we should go through the 
world so misunderstanding one another ; letting 
slip golden opportunities for glimpses into men's 
better nature, Avhich might have knit our hearts to 
theirs for ever in a brotherhood of love, and drawn 
the veil of charity over faults which, in our blind- 
ness, seemed to us without a virtue to balance them. 



THE YOUNG T7IFE'S COOK BOOK. 637 



Angels turn sorrowing away from this sonr "blind- 
ness of ours, and fiends laugh over the final fall of 
despair which our helping hand might at such mo- 
ments have averted. Well for us all ; it is that he 
who is himself without sin, more merciful than man, 
sees gathering tears in ej^es that we deem hard and 
dry. 



ALUM CURD. 

758. Put the white of an egg in a plate, 
and with a lump of alum rub the egg until 
a thick curd is formed ; the curd is some- 
times used as a poultice for an inflammation 
of the eyes. 

An old bachelor says that he is delighted at 
having been called " honey" by the girl he loves, 
because she saluted him at their last meeting as old

THE POTATO REMEDY FOR RHEUMATISM. 

759. It is asserted by some, that a raw 
potato, carried habitually in the pocket, is 
an effectual preventive of rheumatism. 



638 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
TO AVOID CHILBLAINS. 

760. Commence early, before frost sets 
in, to rub the feet and hands with opodeldoc 
(soap liniment) ; this should be done night 
and morning,' keep the feet and hands par- 
ticularly dry, using abundant friction after 
washing, and take plenty of exercise to pro- 
mote circulation. It is the want of the lat- 
ter, as much as any other cause, which 
induces chilblains. Never approach the 
fire immediately after coming in-doors from 
the frosty air. A skipping-rope affords 
admirable house exercise for children, and 
will effectually keep away chilblains, as 
well as many other complaints, if made 
timely use of. 

More ways than one. — A naughty little boy, 
only six years of age, was in the habit of asking 
money from all the gentlemen who came to see his 
father. The latter, in indignation, made him pro- 
mise, under pain of punishment, not to ask any 
more of an}' one. The next day came his father's 
partner ; and the boy, in order not to break the 
promise, said to him, " Do you know any one who 
would lend me a half-penny without ever requiring 
it back asain?" 



THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 639 

TO DESTROY VERMIN. 

761. Small vermin of all kinds may be 
killed and effectually cleared out of their 
favorite resorts by the free use of burning 
fluid. Caution, however, must be used in 
its application to woodwork, as it injures 
paint. 

Bemus asked Jemima, a few days since, if she 
had seen her vegetable friend ? " My vegetable 
friend ! who's that ?" " Wh}', the young man I met 
with you yesterday ! who has carrotty hair, reddish 
whiskers, a turn-up nose, and is full of capers.''^ 



RED WASH FOR BRICK PAVEMENT. 

762. Dissolve an ounce of glue, and 
to this add half a pound of Venetian red, 
one pound of Spanish brown, and sufficient 
hot water to make a thin wash. 



TO PREVENT LAMP SMOKE. 

763. Lay the lamp-wicks in vinegar for 
an hour, dry them well before they are used. 



640 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

A Cuban physician having been robbed to a se- 
rious extent in his tobacco-works, discovered the 
thief by the following ingenious artifice. Having 
called his negro slaves together, he addressed them 
thus : — " My friends, the Great Spirit appeared to 
me during the night, and told me that the person 
who stole my money should, at this instant — this 
very instant — have a parrot's feather at the point of 
his nose." On this announcement, the thief, anx- 
ious to find out if his guilt had declared itself, put 
his finger to his nose, " Man," cried the master 
instantly, " 'tis thou who hast robbed me. The 
Great Spirit has just told me so." 



TO DESTROY RATS AND MICE. 

764. Mix some ground plaster of Paris 
with brown sugar and Indian meal. Set 
it about on old plates, and leave beside 
each plate, a saucer or pan of water. When 
the rats have eaten the mixture they will 
drink the water and die. To attract them 
toward it, you may sprinkle on the edges 
of the plates a little of the oil of rhodium. 
Another method of getting rid of rats is, 
to strew pounded potash in their holes. 
The potash gets into their coats, and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 641 

irritates their skin, and the rats desert the 
place. 

To prevent rats dying in their holes and 
becoming offensive, poison them by mixing 
half a pound of Carbonate of Barytes with a 
quarter of a pound of lard. It produces 
great thirst, the rats leave their holes to 
drink, and are unable to return. 



TO EXTINGUISH FIRE IN A CHIMNEY 

765. Shut the doors and windows and 
throw some powdered brimstone on the fire, 
and stop up the front of the chimney to pre- 
vent the fumes from entering the room. 
The vapor of the brimstone ascending the 
chimney will effectually extinguish the 
flame. If brimstone is not at hand, throw 
some salt on the fire. 



TO COOL A ROOM. 

766. The simplest and cheapest way to 

cool a room is to wet a cloth of any size, 
40 



642 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

the larger the better, and suspend it in the 
place you want cooled. Let the room be 
well ventilated, and the temperature will 
sink from ten to twenty degrees in less than 
an hour. This is the plan adopted by many 
eastern nations. 



TINCTURE FROM SCRAPS OF LEMON-PEEL. 

767. Fill a wdde-mouthed pint bottle 
half full of brandy, or proof spirits, and 
whenever you have bits of waste lemon 
rind, pare the yellow part very thin, and 
drop it into the brandy. This will strongly 
impregnate the spirit with essence of lemon, 
and form an excellent flavoring for tarts, 
custards, etc. 

In a party of ladies, on its being reported that a 
Captain Silli had arrived in town, they exclaimed, 
with one exception, " What a name for a soldier 1'' 
" The fittest name in the world for a Captain," re- 
joined the witty one ; " for silk can never be 
worsted^

A NIGHT-CAP MADE IN A MOMENT. 

768. Take your pocket-handkercliief, 
and laying it out the full square, double 
down one third over the other part. Then 
raise the whole, and turn it over, so that 
the third folded down shall lie underneath. 
Then take hold of one of the folded corners, 
and draw its point toward the centre ; then 
do the same with the other, as in making a 
cocked hat, or a boat of paper. Then take 
hold of the two remaining corners, and 
twisting the hem of the handkerchief, con- 
tinue to roll it until it meets the doubled 
corners brought to the centre and catches 
them up a little. Lift the whole and you 
will see the form of a cap, which, when 
applied to the head, will cover the head and 
ears, and being tied under the chin, will not 
come off. Very little practice will enable a 
person to regulate the size of the folds, so as 
to suit the head. 

A VENERABLE lady of a celebrated physician, one 
day casting her eye out of the window, observed

patients, at which she exclaimed : " I do wish my 
husband would keep away from such processions ; 
it appears too much like a tailor carrying home his 
work.^^ 



RED CEMENT. 

769. The red cement used for uniting 
glass to metals, is made by melting ^ve 
parts of black resin and one part of yellow 
wax ; when entirely melted, stir in gradually, 
one part of red ochre, or Venetian red in fine 
powder, and previously well dried. This 
cement should be melted before it is used, 
and it adheres better if the objects to which 
it is applied are warmed.

molasses, a sufficient quantity to form an 
electuary. The size of a nutmeg to be taken 
several times a day, drinking after it a 
quarter of a pint of the decoction of lovage 
root. 

The quantity of water consumed daily in London 
is equal to the contents of a lake fifty acres in ex- 
tent, and of a mean depth of three feet. This 
quantity is by no means proportionate to the great 
and growing wants of the population. According 
to the last returns, there were seventy thousand 
houses without any supply whatever. 



ACORN TREES. 

771. Very pretty ornaments for the 
parlor may be produced by setting acorns 
to germinate in hyacinth glasses, and 
placing them over the mantel-piece. Half 
fill with rain water, a white glass, one of 
those usually employed for bulbous roots. 
Take a ripe acorn, which has been for a day 
or two steeped in rain water, or in damp 
moss or mould ; with the aid of a piece of 



646 THE YOUNG WIFe's COOK BOOK. 

cork or cardboard suspend the acorn about 
a quarter of an inch above the water. Let 
the cork or cardboard fit the mouth of the 
glass tightly, so as to exclude the air. In a 
few weeks the acorns will begin to grow, 
and the interesting process of the germina- 
tion of one of our noblest trees may be 
watched from time to time. When the 
leaves reach the cork another arrangement 
must be adopted ; the acorn must be raised, 
the leaves be pushed through the cork or 
cardboard, leaving the young plant suspen- 
ded. Should the water become green or 
turbid, it must be changed ; and if any 
fungi appear upon the acorn, they must be 
carefully brushed or wiped away. The oak 
plants thus produced will, with attention, 
flourish for two or three years — the most 
important points for their preservation being 
the changing of the water, and the cleans- 
ing of the roots when fungous plants appear. 
When the acorns are first put to grow, 
nothing must be done to them except re- 



THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 647 

moving the cup ; the shell of the acorn must 
be unmjured. 

Sir Thomas Overbury says that the man who has 
nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestors, 
is like a potato — the only good thing belonging to 
him is under ground. 



TO PREVENT INSECTS CLIMBING UP FRUIT 
TREES. 

772. Let a piece of India rubber be 
burnt over a gallipot, into which it will 
gradually drop, in the condition of a thick 
viscid juice, which state it will retain for 
any length of time. Having melted the 
India rubber, let a piece of cord, or worsted 
be smeared w^ith it, and then tied several 
times round the trunk of the tree. The 
melted substance is so very sticky, that the 
insects will be prevented, and generally 
captured in their attempts to pass over it.

COAL ASHES USEFUL FOR MAKING GARDEN 
WALKS. 

773. To three bushels of coal ashes, not 
sifted very fine, add one bushel of very fine 
gravel. Add water to these, and mix them 
until they become about as soft as mortar. 
Spread over the walks, the surface of which 
should previously be slightly broken and 
raked smooth. Make the mortar-like mix- 
ture smooth and even by spreading it with 
a piece of board. It will become hard in 
a few days. 

There are a good many people in the world who 
spend half their time in thinking what they would 
do if they were rich, and the other half in conjec- 
turing what they shall do as they are not. 



PEA VINES A WINTER ORNAMENT. 

774-. Fill a wide-mouthed glass jar 
with water, and cover it over with a piece 
of '' foundation," (the ladies will understand 
this,) cover that over with a layer of peas, 



THE YOUXa TA^TFE's COOK BOOK. 649 

pressing it down so that the peas will lie in 
the water ; they will then swell and sprout, 
tlie roots growing down into the water, 
their fine fibres presenting a beautiful ap- 
pearance ; set this in a window, and vines 
will grow up which can be conducted to 
any height. 



HOW TO GROW LARGE POTATOES. 

775. To improve the size of potatoes, 
whether planted with small or large, whole 
or even-cut tubers, when the plants are 
only a few inches high, let the shoots be 
reduced by pulling them up to one, two, or 
at most, three of the strongest. The tubers 
will consequently be fewer, and very much 
larger, also, in measure, nearly all fit for the 
table or the market. Growers may assure 
themselves of the efficacy of this method, 
by first experimenting upon a few rows. 

The following is a copy of an excuse recently

handed in to a schoolmaster for the non-attendance 
of one of his scholars: " Cepatomtogoataturing." — 
Kept at home to go a-taturing / 



REMEDY FOR FROZEN POTATOES. 

776. In the time of frosts, potatoes 
that have been affected thereby, should be 
laid in a perfectly dark place for some days 
after the thaw has commenced. If thawed 
in open day, they rot ; but if in darkness, 
they do not rot ; and they lose very little 
of their natural properties. 



POTATOES SLIGHTLY DISEASED PRESERVED 
BY PEAT CHARCOAL. 

777. When potatoes are slightly dis- 
eased, sprinkling peat charcoal among them, 
instantly stays the rot, takes away the bad 
smell, and renders them sweet and whole- 
some food. Potatoes may be kept in this 
way two years, and when planted the third, 
they will produce a good crop. The char- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 651 

coal will also prevent the sound potatoes 
from being infected by the diseased ones. 
The charcoal need not be lost ; it may be 
mixed with other manures when the pota- 
toes are removed. 



TO DESTROY BUGS. 

778. An effectual mode of destroying 
these offensive insects is to brush over the 
beds, walls, or floors infested with them, 
with oil of turpentine, which is equally de- 
structive to the insect and to its eggs. One 
of the best remedies and preventives for 
bed-bugs is to procure from a druggist an 
ounce of quicksilver, and beat it in a mortar 
to a strong froth, with the whites of two 
eggs : or if you wish it very powerful, and 
thick like an ointment, use the white of one 
egg only. If liquid, spread it with the 
feather of a quill : or, what is still better, 
with a large old camel's hair brush, all over 
the cracks and pins of the bedstead, not 



652 THE YOUNG WIFE's COOK BOOK. 

forgetting the under side of all the joints, 
and see that it penetrates thoroughly. If 
you have made an ointment of it, rub it off 
with your finger. This is considered a still 
better remedy than the common mercurial 
ointment, but cannot always be as promptly 
obtained. 

In a new house, where the habits of the 
family are neat, and a general attention is 
paid to cleanliness throughout, there will be 
little danger of bed-bugs ; but on removing 
to an old house which has had various occu- 
pants, these disgusting and intolerable in- 
sects frequently make their appearance with 
the commencement of the warm weather, 
and sometimes before, from having been un- 
pardonably allowed to get possession even 
of the crevices of the wood-work on the 
walls; and if the chambers are papered, 
they often contrive to effect a lodgment 
between the edges of the paper and the 
plastering. If bags are found in the crev- 
ices of an old house, their haunts should be 



THE YOUNG WTFE's COOK BOOK. 653 

well washed with a strong decoction of 
tobacco, boiled in water, or with a decoction 
of red peppers. If these washes (which by 
frequent repetition generally succeed) should 
fail to destroy them, the crevices, as a last 
resource, should be rubbed with quicksilver 
beaten up with the white of an egg ; and 
afterward filled up wdth putty or wadding, 
or with quick-lime mixed with water. 

Another mode of destroying the vermin 
is, a saturated solution of alum applied hot, 
with a brush, to every joint and crevice that 
can possibly harbor them. Spirits of naph- 
tha, also, applied in the same way, but cold, 
has been found effectual. 

A most effectual remedy against bugs is to 
have all the bedsteads in the house taken 
down, and after washing the joints with 
cold water and brown soap, to have the 
whole bedstead completely varnished, even 
on the inside of the joint. 

In very bad cases, where the whole room, 
walls, floors, and ceilings, are infested, the 



654 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

only effectual remedy is fumigation. Re- 
move every thing from the room that you 
are satisfied is perfectly free from the vermin, 
then close every opening, and even every 
chink and crevice in the room that might 
admit air ; pasting paper over the joints of 
the doors, etc. Then cut up four ounces of 
brimstone into an iron pan, light some slips 
of linen dipped in brimstone, and place them 
in the pan, leaving the room without delay, 
closing the door and covering even the 
key-hole. In twenty-four hours no living 
creature will exist in the apartment. 



RECEIPT FOR PRESERVING AND MAKING 
LEATHER WATERPROOF. 

779. One part tallow, one part best sperm

PREFACE. 



THE Young Wife's Cook Book will be 
found to contain a carefully prepared system 
of cooking, comprising receipts for preparing 
everything suitable to go on any one's table, 
as well as for preparing good and tempting 
dishes from cold meats, vegetables, and pud- 
dings, which may be served with all the 
warmth and appetizing appearance of the 
original dish. Every housekeeper must be 
aware that no previous book upon cooking 
has been given containing satisfactory infor- 
mation upon this point. That this subject 
is important, will be recognized when we 
think that there are none but the families 
and houses of the wealthiest who do not, as 
a general rule, have roasts, as well as other 
eatables, sent to the table twice and even 

thrice. How much more acceptable, then, 

19 



20 PREFACE. 

to our luxurious American taste, would be a 
warm, savory dinner, prepared from these 
materials, than the everlasting " cold 
shoulder." 

We give also to our readers numerous 
receipts for preparing for the table the sec- 
ondary parts of animals such as the heart, 
liver, tripe, feet, etc., and compounding 
from these usually cheap portions many 
dishes which will rival the great joints, and 
win the suffrages of those who are tired of 
the endless succession of beef, mutton and 
chicken. 

It has been thought advisable, therefore, 
to give in this work a collection of plain 
and useful receipts, selected from family 
MSS., having been tried and vouched for 
by those from whom they have been ob- 
tained. It is also enriched by the contribu- 
tions of many foreign friends, who have 
given us the opportunity of verifying the 
savins; that America has no national cuisine, 

c/ 

but assimilates to herself the experience of 



PREFACE. 21 

every nation, to prepare the abundance of 
riches that a kind Providence has showered 
upon us. 

We recommend, particularly to young 
housekeepers, a profound study of our 
Housewifery department. The hints are 
not only invaluable, but have been well 
tried and their worth ascertained. Indeed, 
the contents of our whole book are entirely 
new, and useful information will be found 
upon each and every page, tending to sim- 
plify labor, and to increase the comforts of 
any one's home. 

Though it is not desirable, in this enlight- 
ened age, that ladies should, like their great- 
grandmothers, devote themselves exclusively 
to household duties, yet a thorough knowl- 
edge of domestic management is not incom- 
patible with the cultivation of the mind, 
or the practice of those accomplishments 
which adorn the sex. On the contrary, 
this knowledge encourages them to all the 
studios and pursuits which tend to make 



22 PREFACE. 

home happy. The useful instruction so 
necessary to attain this great aim of life 
is rarely supplied at school, or at home, to 
girls at that early age when the mind is 
ductile, and the frame active ; and conse- 
quently, in mature years, the attempt to ac- 
quire new habits is frequently irksome and 
mortifying* 

Let every young wife and mother remem- 
ber her serious responsibility, and take care 
that the husband and the children find their 
home to be truly the haven of refuge from 
temptation the calm resting place from 
labor and care and the bright and cheerful 
abode of comfort. Good sense, good humor, 
and good principles are the female spells 
that diffuse cheerfulness and peace around 
the hearth of the poor as well as the rich 
man. Intellectual attainments, and bril- 
liant accomplishments, are agreeable fireside 
companions; but any woman, if she earn- 
estly determines to do her duty faithfully 
and pleasantly, may make her humble fire- 



PREFACE. 23 

side as happy to her husband, children, and 
friends, as the brilliant drawing-room. In 
the management of a household, as well as 
in the regulation of the human mind, it is 
attention to the smaller daily duties which 
forms the sum of usefulness and happi- 
ness. 

Domestic comfort may be equally attained 
by all classes provided, always, that the 
expenditure does not exceed the means, and 
that cheerful exertions are used to make the 
best of the means. 

The mistress of a family should always 
remember, that the welfare and good man- 
agement of the house depend on the eye of 
the superior and consequently that nothing 
is too trifling for her notice whereby waste 
may be avoided. 

If a lady has never been accustomed, 
while single, to think of family manage- 
ment, let her not on that account fear that 
she cannot attain the art. 

It is certainly desirable to proportion the 






24 PREFACE. 

style of living as well to the fortune, as to 
the position in society ; but if the two can- 
not be made to agree, justice demands the 
sacrifice of such appendages to station as 
are inconsistent with the means. 

The expenditure must be carefully con- 
sidered, and retrenchment made on such 
articles as will least affect the comfort of 
her family. Every woman who earnestly 
sets about it, may live within the means. 
An excellent common-sense maxim in house- 
hold management, as well as in important 
affairs, is, " Begin nothing without steadily 
looking to the end." 

A prudent housekeeper will always pro- 
vide in time everything that is actually 
wanted ; but will never be tempted to buy 
what is not wanted, and then try to find a 
use for it. 

She should never allow hurry or bustle to 
be the practice of the household, or nothing 
will be well done. 

It is unnecessary for any woman to say 



PREFACE. 25 

she has not time to perform some important 
duty. A due arrangement and economy 
of time leaves opportunity for all things 
needful. 

Economy is an arrangement of order of 
things to produce a certain result. There- 
fore, no economy can be so important as the 
economy of time, the most precious posses- 
sion of man. 

A little reflection in the morning will 
enable mistress or servant to make due ar- 
rangements for the employment of the day 
before her, so that not one moment shall be 
misspent the important duties to be per- 
formed at regular and stated periods; the 
lesser occupations to be introduced to fill up 
the disengaged spaces. 

In the pursuits of the mistress of a family 
there may be, however, unavoidable inter- 
ruptions visitors; unforeseen domestic af- 
fairs; or accidents. But for these a well- 
regulated mind is ever prepared. Idle visit- 
ors must and will infest the homes of the 



26 PREFACE. 

industrious, but the time need not be wholly 
lost. A piece of needlework, knitting, or 
even some simple household occupation may 
be carried on without offence to the visitors, 
and may, on the contrary, afford them a 
very useful lesson. 

On the mutual duties of servants and 
employers, we may say, that, in general, 
moderate demands and judicious forbearance 
produce respectful obedience. Servants 
should always remember that their services 
are only the just payment for their wages 
and support, and should scrupulously render 
them. But the attachment of a servant to 
a family can only be bought by mildness, 
forbearance and kind words to them.

SOUPS. 

BOUILLON. 

1. A kind of French soup or stew, pre- 
pared as follows : An earthen pot, made to 
hold from one to seven pounds of meat is 
provided. A sufficient quantity of lean 
meat, usually part of the leg or shoulder, 
is put into this vessel, which is then filled 
up with cold water the proportion being 
five pints of water to a pound and a half of 
meat. The pot is then placed on the hearth 
close to the wood fire, and generally on the 
hot ashes. When it begins to simmer, the 
scum which is thrown up is carefully re- 
moved from time to time, three-quarters of 

(39) 



40 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

an hour being allowed for this purpose. A 
carrot, half a parsnip, a turnip, an onion, a 
little celery, and any other vegetables in 
season, are then added, together with salt, 
pepper, and spice. After these additions, 
the pot remains covered at the fire, and is 
kept there simmering for six hours more, 
hot water being from time to time supplied 
in the place of that which has evaporated. 

MARRIAGE-RING SYMBOLIZED. We see many times 
even the godly couples to jar when they are mar- 
ried, because there is some unfitness between them 
which makes odds. What is odds but the contrary 
to even ? Therefore, make them even, saith one, 
and there will be no odds. Hence came the first 
use of the ring in weddings : for if it be straighter 
than the finger it will pinch ; and if it be wider than 
the finger it will fall off; but if it be fit, it neither 
pincheth nor slippeth. 



BOUILLON. 



2. This is the common soup of France, 
and is in use in almost every French 
family. Put beef in an earthen stock-pot, 
in the proportion of one pound to one quart 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 41 

of cold water. Place it at the side of the 
fire and let it become slowly hot. By so 
doing the fibre of the meat is enlarged, the 
gelatine is dissolved, and the savorous parts 
of the meat are diffused through the broth. 
When the object is simply to make a good, 
pure-flavored beef broth, part of the shin 
or leg will answer the purpose, adding some 
vegetables, and letting it stew four or five 
hours. But if the meat is to be eaten, the 
rump, or leg-of-mutton piece should be used. 

BUT consider, and forget not thine own weak- 
ness ; so shalt thou pardon the failings of others. 



BEEP SOUP. 

3. Crack the bone of a shin of beef, 
and put it on to boil, in one quart of water 
to every pound of meat, and a large tea- 
spoonful of salt to each quart of water. 
Let it boil two hours ; and skim it well. 
Then add four turnips, pared and cut in 



42 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

quarters, four onions pared and sliced, two 
carrots scraped and cut in slices, one root 
of celery cut in small pieces, and one bunch 
of sweet herbs (which should be washed 

and tied with a thread, as they are to be 
taken out when the soup is served). When 
the vegetables are tender, take out the 
meat, strain off the soup and return it to 
the pot again ; thicken it with a little flour 
and water ; then add some parsley finely 
chopped, with more salt and pepper to the 
taste, and some dumplings, made of a tea- 
spoonful of butter to two of flour, moist- 
ened with a little water or milk. Drop 
these dumplings into the boiling soup ; let 
them boil five minutes; and serve them 
with the soup in the tureen. Noodles may 
be substituted for the dumplings. 



Two SORTS OP TRIALS. "Ah, Sam, so you've been 
in trouble, eh?" "Yes, Jem, yes." " Well, well, 
cheer up, man ; adversity tries us, and shows up 
our better qualities." "Ah, but adversity didn't try 
me it was an Old Bailey judge, and he showed up 
my worst qualities." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 43 

A CHEAP SOUP. 

4. Wash three-quarters of a pound of 
barley in a little cold water ; put it in a 
soup-pot with a shin or leg of beef of about 
ten pounds weight, cut into four pieces. 
Cover it well with cold water and set it on 
the fire. When it boils, skim it well, and 
put in two large onions. Set it by the fire 
to simmer very gently about two hours ; 
then skim all fat off, and put in two heads 
of celery, and a large turnip cut into small 
squares. Season it with salt, and let it boil 
an hour and a half longer. Take out the 
meat with a slice, cover it up, and set it by 
the fire to keep warm, and skim the broth 
well before you put it into the tureen. Put 
a quart of the soup into a basin ; put about 
an ounce of flour into a stew-pan, and pour 
the broth into it by degrees, stirring it well 
together. Set it on the fire and stir till it 
boils, then let it boil up. Put the meat in 
a dish, and strain the sauce through a sieve 



44 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

over the meat. Add, if liked, some capers 
or minced gherkins or walnuts, etc. The 
water in which meat has been boiled makes 
an excellent soup for the poor, by adding 
vegetables, barley, or peas. Roast beef 
bones make fine pea-soup ; and should be 
boiled with the peas the day before eaten, 
that the fat may be taken off. 

A GLUTTON fell sick, and sent for a doctor. " T 
have lost my appetite," said he, in great alarm. 
" It's not of the slightest consequence," replied the 
doctor; "you'll be sure to die if you recover it." 



4 



SAGO SOUP. 

5. Boil two pounds of beef in rather 
more water than sufficient to cover it, until 
the essence is completely extracted from the 
meat. Strain the broth, and add to the 
broth one teacupful of sago. Boil it gently 
for one hour, but do not let the sago be- 
come too soft. Beat the yolks of three 
eggs, pour them into your soup tureen, and 
then pdur in the soup very gradually, stir- 
ring it gently. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 45 

SOUP OF BEEF'S HEART. 

6. Soak the heart several hours in salt 
and water to extract the blood, then cut it 
in large pieces, lengthwise. Parboil it, and 
cut it into small pieces, which must be put 
back into the liquor to which add pepper, 
salt, some celery cut fine, a turnip cut in 
slices, some carrots nicely sliced, an onion 
chopped fine, and a bunch of parsley. Let 
it boil again till the vegetables are tender ; 
mix a little flour and water smoothly, and 
pour in to thicken the soup a very little. 

" WHY do you not hold up your head as I do ?' 
inquired an aristocratic lawyer of a laboring far- 
mer. "Squire," replied the farmer, " look at that 
field of grain. All the valuable heads hang down, 
like mine, while those that have nothing in them 
stand upright, like yours!" 



VEAL SOUP. 

7. Take a knuckle of veal, put it in a 
pot with four quarts of water, and add a 
teaspoonful of salt to each quart. Pare and 



46 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

slice three onions, four turnips, two carrots, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, and a small portion 
of celery. Let the veal boil one hour, then 
add the above vegetables. When they are 
tender, strain the soup. Put it in the pot 
it was boiled in, thicken the soup with some 
flour mixed smoothly with a little water, 
and add a little parsley finely chopped. 
Make some dumplings of a teaspoonful of 
butter, to two of flour, and milk or water 
enough to make a very soft dough. Drop 
them into the boiling soup. They should 
be about as large as a hickory-nut, when 
they are put in. If noodles are preferred, 
they may be put in and boiled ten minutes. 
Dish the meat with the vegetables around 
it. Drawn butter may be served with it, 
or any other meat sauce. 

A GENTLEMAN, finding some swine amongst his 
vines, said to his servant : " He to whom they 
belong is a fool." One of his servants, who recog- 
nized these animals, said to him: "Sir, they are 
jours." "Well," rejoined the gentleman, "as I 
have said it, I shall not contradict myself." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 47 

SOUP FROM CALF'S FEET. 

8. Take four feet, clean them nicely and 
put them on to boil with rather more water 
than to cover them. Add to this three 
cnions sliced, three turnips cut in quarters, 
three carrots sliced, a bunch of parsley, the 
green top of a head of celery chopped fine, 
with salt and pepper to the taste. While 
boiling remove all the fat and scum. If the 
water boils away too much add a little more. 
Just before serving roll a piece of butter in 
some flour and stir it in. 

A HERO. " Well, my good fellow," said a victori- 
ous general to a favorite soldier after a battle, " and 
what did you do to help us to gain this victory ?" 
" Do, may it please your honor, why I walked 
bouldly up to one of the inimy and cut off his foot." 
" Cut off his foot ! Why didn't you cut off his head ?" 
"Ah, an' faith, your honor, that was off already." 



MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

9. Scald a calf's head, which cut into 
inch squares ; wash and clean them well, 
dry them with a cloth, and put them into a 



48 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

stew-pan, with two gallons of stock gravy, 
sweet basil, knotted marjoram, savory, a lit- 
tle thyme, some parsley, all chopped fine, 
cloves and mace pounded, half a pint of 
Madeira or sherry ; stew all together gently 
for four hours ; heat a little butter and milk 
[one pint], some flour mixed smooth in it, 
the yolk of two eggs ; keep these stirring 
over a gentle fire until near boiling; put 
this in the soup, stirring it as you put it in, 
for it is very apt to curdle ; then let all stew 
together for half an hour ; when it is ready 
to send to table, throw in some forcemeat 
balls and hard yolks of eggs ; when off the 
fire, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon. 

STEP among your neighbors, reader, and see 
whether those among them who have got along 
smoothly, accumulated property, and gained a good 
name, have not been men who bent themselves to 
one single branch of business. It must be so. Go 
out in the spring, when the sun is far distant, and 
you can scarcely feel the influence of its beams, 
scattered as they are over the wide face of creation ; 
but collect those beams to a focus, and they kindle 
up a flame in an instant. So the man that squanders 
his talents and his strength on many things, will 
fail to make an impression with either: but let him 



THE YOUNG WIFE^S COOK BOOK. 49 

draw them to a point let him strike at a single ob- 
ject, and itfwill yield before him. 



WHITE SOUP. 

10. Take two quarts of the stock, and 
boil the crumb of a roll in a gill of milk ; 
beat the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs with 
three ounces of sweet almonds very well in 
a mortar, with a little cayenne pepper, and 
add the whole to the soup ; it may be poured 
over slices of French roll sent up in the tu- 
reen. White soup may also be varied with 
the rice. Wash two or three ounces of the 
best kind, blanch it in boiling water, and 
drain it ; add the rice to the soup and let it 
stew until it swells; or thicken it with 
ground rice, bruised sago, tapioca, or arrow- 
root. If macaroni is used, it should be added 
soon enough to get perfectly tender, after 
soaking in cold water. Vermicelli may be 
added after the thickening, as it requires less 
time to do. If the stock has been made with 

fowl, take out the white portion when well 
3 



50 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

stewed, pound the meat in a mortar, and 
add it to the soup which is a great improve- 
ment. It is the fashion now to send up 
grated Parmesan cheese with white soup; 
but it partly destroys that delicacy which 
ought to be the distinctive property of all 
white soups. 

"Is a man and his wife one?" asked the wife 
of a man in a state of stupefaction, as she was hold- 
ing his aching head in both hands. " Yes, I sup- 
pose so," was the reply. "Well, then," said she, 
" I came home very drunk last night, and I ought 
to be ashamed of myself." 



WHITE SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

11. Put two quarts of water into a clean 
saucepan, the crumb of a small baker's loaf, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, some whole grains 
of pepper, two or three cloves, an onion 
chopped fine and a little salt. Let it boil 
half an hour. Then take the white parts of 
celery, endive, and lettuce, cut them into 
pieces, boil them in the soup till quite smooth. 
Strain the soup, set it over the fire again, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 51 

and when it begins to boil add a lump of 
butter rolled in a little flour ; let it boil a 
few minutes more, and serve. 

AN old gentlewoman who lived almost entirely 
on soups, told us it was a long time before she could 
get them made uniformly good till she made the 
following rule " if the soup was good, she let the 
cook have the remainder of it if it was not she gave 
it to her lap-dog ;" but as soon as this resolution 
was known, poor little Bow-Wow seldom got the 
sweet treat after. 



FRENCH GUMBO. 

12. Cut up one large fowl; season it 
with salt and pepper ; dredge it well with 
flour ; have ready a soup-kettle ; put in a 
tablespoonful of butter, one of lard, a hand- 
ful of chopped onion. Fry the fowl then to 
a good brown ; add to this four quarts of 
boiling water; cover close ; let it simmer two 
or three hours ; then put in fifty oysters with 
their liquor, a little thyme and parsley ; just 
before serving, stir in a tablespoonful of the 
filee powder ; season high with Cayenne pep- 
per. Turkey and beef-steak can make also 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 



very good gumbo. The filee or felee is what 
gives a mucilaginous character and excel- 
lence to the soup. The powder consists of 
nothing more than the leaves of the sassa- 
fras cured in the shade, and then pounded 
and sifted ; therefore, any family in the coun- 
try can always have it in their house. 

IF youth knew what age would crave, it would 
both get and save. 



OYSTER SOUP. 

13. Take one hundred oysters out of the 
liquor. To half of the liquor add an equal 
quantity of water. Boil it with one teaspoon- 
ful of crushed allspice, a little mace, some 
Cayenne pepper and salt. Let it boil twenty 
minutes, then strain it, put it back in the 
stew-pan and add the oysters. As soon as 
it begins to boil add a teacupful of cream 
and a little grated cracker rubbed in one 
ounce of butter. As soon as the oysters are 
plump, serve them. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 53 

ASSIST CHILDREN TO OBEY. " Kiss mamma, dear- 
est," is a command you may be sure will be obeyed 
with alacrity, but beware how you hazard your au- 
thority by saying " Kiss that lady, my dear." Look 
well at the countenance of the child before you 
issue the command, to see whether it is willing to 
be embraced ; for it is of no importance whether it 
salute a stranger or not, but it is of immense im- 
portance that it should not disobey its mother in a 
single instance. 



CLAM SOUP. 

14. Boil fifty clams in two quarts of 
water, mix together, and add to it a little 
butter and flour. Just before it is taken off 
the fire, stir in the yolks of two eggs, and 
some cream, with a few sprigs of parsley 
and pepper ; after these are added, let it 
simmer a few minutes, and then serve it. 
If preferred the parsley may be omitted. 

A LADY was engaged in domestic affairs, and the 
servant, who was a Catholic, when the door bell 
was rung, was requested by her mistress to say that 
she was not at home. "Yes, ma'am," said the ser- 
vant ; and after she had done as she was bid, she 
returned to her mistress and inquired, " When 
I go to the praste, shall I confess that as my lie, 
ma'am, or shall I say it was yours." 



54 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

CLAM SOUP. 

15. Take a knuckle of veal and boil it 
in three quarts of water salted to liking, 
with fifty clams and their juice, together 
with seasoning of pepper, parsley and onions. 
If the clams are small use more of them. 
Add to the soup some small dumplings 
made of an egg, some butter, and flour 
sufficient to form a paste. 

A MISERLY old lady, during the war, kept an inn. 
One day a famished soldier called, and asked for 
something to eat. Some beef bones, that had been 
pretty well picked, were set before him. After 
finishing his dinner, a little son of the landlady, no- 
ticing that the soldier found it very difficult to 
make out much of a dinner, put some money in his 
hand as he stepped out of the door. " How much 
was it worth, mother, to pick those bones ?" asked 
the boy. "A shilling," was the reply, the old lady 
expecting to receive the money. " I thought so, 
mother," replied the boy, "so / gave the soldier a 
shilling for doing it, and sent him away." 



EGG SOUP. 



16. Add to a pint of water the yolk of 
an egg well beaten, an ounce of butter, and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 55 

the same quantity of sugar. Set it over the 
fire and stir it till it begins to simmer, then 
pour it several times from the pan to a basin, 
and back a;am till it is smoothed and 

i_/ 

frothed. This is a pleasant and good resto- 
rative. 

AT breakfast one morning at an inn, a foreigner 
made quick despatch with the eggs. Thrusting a 
spoon into the middle, he drew out the yolk, de- 
voured it, and passed on to the next. When he had 
swallowed the seventh, an old farmer, who had al- 
ready been prejudiced against monsieur by his mus- 
taches, could brook the extravagance no longer, 
and speaking up, said, " Why, sir, you leave all the 
white ! How is the landlord to afford a breakfast at 
that rate?" " Yy," replied the foreigner, "you 
wouldn't have me eat de vite ? De yolk is de 
chicken ; de vite de fedders. Yould you have me 
make' von bolster of myself?" The farmer had 
never viewed the matter in that light before. 



PEPPEE POT. 

17. Put your tripe on in water enough to 
cover it, allowing a teaspoonful of salt to 
each quart of water. Let it boil till quite 
tender, then have ready two calf's feet, put 
them in the pot with the tripe. Add four 



56 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

onions chopped fine, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs. Just before taking it off the fire add 
two ounces of butter rolled in flour. Season 
the soup very highly with Cayenne pepper 
and salt. Whole grains of allspice or cloves 
may be added if liked. 



' I ADVISE you," says Johnson, " and I advise you 
with great earnestness, to do nothing that may hurt 
you, and to reject nothing that may do you good. 
To preserve health is a moral and religious duty, 
for health is the basis of all social virtue ; we can 
be useful no longer than when we are well." 



BEAN SOUP. 

18. Put a piece of pickled pork in a pot 
with two quarts of water. In another pot 
put one quart of dried beans after being 
picked and washed. As soon as the beans 
begin to boil take them out, put them in a 
colander to drain, then put them in with 
the pork and cover the whole with water. 
Boil them till they are quite soft. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 57 

SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

19. To one quart of water add three 
potatoes, three onions, three turnips, two 
carrots, a tablespoonful of rice or barley, and 
salt to the taste. Boil it down to one pint, 
then add a little parsley chopped fine about 
ten minutes before it is taken off the fire. 



GREEN CORN SOUP. 

20. Put on a knuckle of veal to boil in 
three quarts of water, and three teaspoonsful 
of salt. Cut the corn off of one dozen ears, 
and put it on to boil with the veal. When 
the veal is tender the soup is done. Then 
roll an ounce of butter in flour and add to 
it before it is served. If the fire has been 
very hot and the water has boiled away too 
much, a little more may be added. 

ENVY not the happiness in any man, for thou 
knowest not his secret griefs. 



58 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

SUMMER SOUP. 

21. Two cucumbers, twelve or fourteen 
onions, three potatoes, one lettuce, one head 
of white cabbage ; fry these together in 
butter, stew them three or four hours in 
three pints of stock ; add a little green mint, 
parsley, and a pint of green peas; let it 
stew for two hours more ; press it through a 
sieve and thicken it with flour and butter. 



A GENTLEMAN being asked to give a definition of 
nonsense, replied, in a Thorn psonian st} T le " Sir, it 
is nonsense to bolt a door with a boiled carrot." 



GREEN PEA SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

22. Take a quart of young green peas, 
and divide half a pint from them. Put 
them on in boiling water ; boil until tender, 
then pour off the water and set it by to 
make the soup w r ith. Put the boiled peas 
into a pan and mash them ; then put them 
back into the water they were boiled in ; stir 
all well together, and rub it through a hair 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 59 

sieve. Boil the half pint of peas, separated 
from the others, and when done, turn them 
into the soup and boil hot. The same may 
be made with the liquor in which calf's 
head, calf's feet, or joints of veal, mutton, 
etc., have been boiled. 

THE following advertisement lately appeared in 
a Jerse} 7 " print : " To be sold, by private contract, a 
beautiful rooster monkey, a parrot, two poodles, and 
a tortoise-shell cat, the property of a lady just mar- 
ried, who has no further use for them. 



ANOTHER SOUP OF GREEN PEAS. 

23. To a pint of shelled peas add one 
quart of boiling water. When the peas are 
nearly soft, roll two ounces of butter in flour 
and stir in. Add pepper and salt to the 
taste, and a large dessert spoonful of sugar. 

A RECEIPT FOR PEACE SOTJP. For every angry 
word that's uttered against you, put in one mild 
one. This will be found to be a very useful soup 
in families troubled with irritable tempers.

ANOTHER SOUP OF GREEN PEAS. 

24. Boil three quarts of shelled peas in 
two quarts of water. Mix three ounces of 
butter with flour until quite smooth; add a 
little salt, 'black pepper, and a dust of cay- 
enne pepper, and stir into the boiling peas 
until the whole boils again, and you will 
have a cheap and wholesome summer dish.

FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 

FISH AS FOOD. 

25. There is much nourishment in fish, 
little less than in butcher's meat, weight for 
weight ; and in effect it may be more nour- 
ishing, considering how, from its soft fibre, 
fish is more easily digested. Moreover, 
there is in fish a substance which does not 
exist in the flesh of land animals, viz. : 
iodine a substance which may have a 
beneficial effect upon the health, and tend 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 61 

to prevent the production of scrofulous and 
tubercular disease ; the latter, in the form 
of pulmonary consumption, one of the 
most cruel and fatal which the civilized, 
highly educated and refined are afflicted 
with. Comparative trials prove that, in 
the majority of fish, the proportion of solid 
matter that is, the matter which remains 
after perfect desiccation, or the expulsion 
of the aqueous part is little inferior to 
the several kinds of butcher's meat, game 
or poultry. And if we give attention to 
classes of people, classed as to the quality 
of the food they principally subsist on, we 
find that the ichthyophagous classes are 
especially strong, healthy, and prolific. In 
no class than that of fishers do we see so 
large families, handsome women, more 
robust and active men, or greater exemp- 
tions from maladies. 



62 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

FISH. 

26. Fish should always be perfectly 
fresh when cooked. To select fresh ones 
observe the eyes; if they have a bright, life- 
like appearance the fish is fresh ; if, on the 
contrary, the eyes are sunken and dark 
colored, and have lost their brilliancy, they 
are certainly stale. Some judge by the 
redness of the gills, but they are sometimes 
colored to deceive customers. 



ECONOMICAL MODE OF COOKING SALMON. 

27. Cut some slices in the direction of 
the width of the fish. Put them in boiling 
water with a little salt, and let them boil 
ten minutes. By this method, the waste 
usually resulting from preparing the whole 
fish at once, is avoided. 

A CLASS was reciting a lesson in metaphysics 
the chapter on motives operating on the human will 
when a mackerel vender went by shouting, 
"Mackerel, fine fresh mackerel 1" Suddenly, dis- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 63 

turbed by the noise, the master inquired of the 
class what motive the man had for making such a 
noise. No answer being given, he said they must 
be deaf as haddocks, and flat as flounders, not to 
perceive that it was a sell-fish motive. 



HALIBUT. 

28. Cut it in slices about a quarter of 
an inch thick ; wash and dry them, season 
with Cayenne pepper and salt; have ready 
a pan of hot lard, and fry your fish in it 
till of a delicate brown on both sides. 

Some dip the cutlets in beaten egg and 
then in bread crumbs, and fry them. When 
done in this manner it should be cut rather 
thinner than according to the first method. 

Or, heat your gridiron, grease the bars, 
season your fish with Cayenne pepper and 
salt, and broil it till of a fine brown color. 
Lay it on a dish and butter it.

revival of religion in our church, and both our 
children (the Lord be praised) are converted. 
Father got to be rather an incumbrance, and last 
week we took him to the poor-house. Your affec- 
tionate brother." 



CAT-FISH. 

29. Cut each fish in two parts, down the 
back and stomach; take out the upper part 
of the back bone next the head; wash and 
wipe them dry, season with Cayenne pep- 
per and salt, and dredge flour over them; 
fry them in hot lard of a nice light brown. 
Some dress them like oysters; they are 
then dipped in beaten egg and bread 
crumbs, and fried in hot lard. They are 
very nice dipped in beaten egg, without the 
crumbs, and fried. 

SERJEANT Cockle, who was a rough, blustering 
advocate, once o-ot from a witness more than he

gave. In a trial of a right of fishery, he asked the 
witness, " Don't you love fish?" "Ay," replied the 
witness, "but I donna like cockle sauce with it! 1 ' 

WHEN a man has the headache, and says, "It's 
the salmon," you may safely conclude that he has 
been drinking like a fish."

TO CURE SHAD. 

30. Clean the shad nicely, place them 
in layers with back down, and laid open 
so as the inside of the fish may be up. 
Sprinkle each fish plentifully with ground 
salt, and let them stand twenty-four hours. 
This draws out all the blood. Wipe them 
all dry with clean napkins. Place them in 
layers in a clean tub, with the backs down 
as before. For one hundred shad take half 
a pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of 
brown sugar. Strew plenty of rock salt 
over them with the saltpetre and sugar; 
there is no danger of putting on too much 
salt as they will only absorb a certain 
quantity. 

NEVER go late to a friend's dinner ; for you may

SHAD EOASTED ON A BOARD. 

31. Take a piece of clean oak board, 
about three inches thick and two feet 
square, stand it before the fire till the 
board is very hot, indeed, almost charred. 
Have your shad split down the back, 
cleaned, washed, wiped dry, and seasoned 
with salt. Fasten it to the hot board with 
a few small nails the skin side should be 
next the board ; place the board before the 
fire, with the head part down. As soon as 
the juices begin to run turn it with the tail 
dow r n. It should be turned frequently, in 
order to retain the juices. When done, 
butter it and serve it hot. Send it to the 
table on the board. This is the receipt 
for baking shad of the Philadelphia "fish 
house." 



BUOILED SHAD, 

32. Split your shad down the back, 
wash it, and season it well with salt. Have 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 67 

your gridiron heated grease the bars 
put on the shad, and broil it slowly till 
quite done. It should be of a fine brown 
on both sides. If designed for the dinner- 
table, after having basted it well with but- 
ter on both sides, fold it over, that it may 
assume its original form, and serve it. 

MR. WATSON, uncle to the late Marquis of Rock- 
ingham, a man of immense wealth, finding himself 
at the point of death, desired a friend who was pres- 
ent to reach him a drawer, in which was an old 
shirt, that he might put it on. Being asked why he 
would wish to change his linen when he was so ill, 

O ' 

he replied " Because I am told that the shirt I die 
in must be the nurse's perquisite, and this is good 
enough for her." This is as bad as the old woman, 
who, with her last breath, blew out an inch of 
candle, " Because," said she, " I can see to die in 
the dark!" 



SHAD, SOTJCED. 

33. Cut the fish in half, and then in 
slices, crosswise. Put them in a milk crock, 
with very sour cold vinegar poured over 
them ; then add Cayenne pepper, fine black 
pepper, salt, and whole allspice. Put a 



68 TEE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

crust over the top of the crock, and stand 
it in an oven. The fish must be highly 
seasoned. 



BOILED SHAD. 

34. Clean your shad, wash it and wipe 
it, flour it well, wrap it in a cloth, and put 
it into a large vessel of boiling water with 
a great deal of salt. It will require about 
twenty minutes to cook it. Serve it with 
egg sauce or rich drawn butter. 



'OO 



THE OAK, that now spreadeth its branches 
toward the heavens, was once but an acorn in the 
bowels of the earth. 



FRIED SHAD. 

35. Cut your shad in half, wash it and 
wipe it dry, score it, and season with Cay- 
enne pepper and salt, dredge flour over it, 
and fry it in hot lard. When done, put the 
two halves together, that it may assume the 
appearance of the whole fish. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 69 

POTTED SHAD. 

36. Cut a shad in six or eight pieces, 
wash and wipe it dry. Mix one dessert- 
spoonful of ground allspice, half a table- 
spoonful of black pepper, and half a table- 
spoonful of salt sprinkle a portion of this 
seasoning over each piece of shad. Put 
them into a stone jar, with enough good 
cider vinegar to cover them ; cover the jar 
with a clean cloth, and over this tie closely 
several thicknesses of brown paper to keep 
in the steam ; set it in a moderate oven and 
let it remain twelve hours. This is very 
good, but the fish is dark-colored. 

THE SLOTHFUL MAN is a burthen to himself; his 
hours hang heavy on his head ; he loitereth about,

WHITE POTTED SHAD. 

37. Cut a shad in about half a dozen 
pieces, wash it and wipe it dry. Mix to- 
gether two tablespoonfuls of whole allspice 



70 THE YOUNG WIFE'S OOOK BOOK. 

and one tablespoonful of whole black pep- 
per ; put one tablespoonful and a half of 
salt over the shad the evening before it is 
to be potted ; the next morning sprinkle 
over it half a teaspoonful of Cayenne pep- 
per. Place the shad in a stone jar, and 
over each layer throw a portion of the 
grains of pepper and allspice, cover it with 
vinegar, and set it in a moderate oven for 
twelve hours. 

" SIR," said a fierce lawyer, " do you, on your 
oath, swear that this is not your handwriting?" 
" I reckon not," was the reply. " Does it resemble 
your writing ?" " Yes, I think it don't." " Do you 
swear that it don't resemble your writing?" "I 
do !" " You take your oath that this writing does 
not resemble yours in a single letter?" " Y-e-a-s, 
sir." " Now, how do you know ?" " 'Cause I can't 
write, sir 1" 



FRIED ROCK. 

38. Clean and score your fish, wash, 
and wipe them dry, and season well with 
Cayenne pepper and salt. Let them stand 
at least one hour before they are cooked, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 71 

that the seasoning may have time to pene- 
trate them. Have ready a pan of hot lard, 
dredge flour over your fish, put them in the 
pan and fry them slowly, that they may be 
done through. They should be of a hand- 
some brown on both sides. All pan fish are 
fried in the same way. 

IP thy soul thirsteth for honor, if thy ear hath 
any pleasure in the voice of praise, raise thyself 
from the dust whereof thou art made, and exalt thy 
aim to something that is praiseworthy. 



BOILED ROCK. 

39. Scale a rock, take out the eyes and 
gills, draw it, and wash it well. Flour a 
cloth, wrap the fish in it, and boil it in 
plenty of water strongly salted. A com- 
mon-sized fish requires about half a large 
teacupful of salt. Place your fish-kettle 
over a strong fire, and when the water boils 
put in the fish. Let it boil hard twenty 
minutes. Take it out of the cloth carefully, 



72 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

place it on your fish dish, and send it to the 
table. Have egg sauce in a sauce boat. 
Mashed potatoes are an accompaniment to 
boiled fish. Garnish the dish with green 
parsley. If any of the boiled fish should 
be left from dinner, it may be spiced as 
shad, and make an excellent relish for 
breakfast or tea. 



COLD BOILED ROCK FISH, 

40. Lay the fish in a deep dish. Put as 
much vinegar as will cover it into a kettle 
with some whole grains of allspice, a little 
mace and two or three cloves. Boil the 
vinegar and spice. Season the fish highly 
with Cayenne pepper and salt. Then pour 
the spiced vinegar over while boiling hot. 
When cold it makes a nice relish for break- 
fast. Any boiled fish may be prepared in 
the same manner. 

WHEN Canning's health was drunk, at the Minis- 
ter's Blackwall dinner, he replied, " Gentlemen, this 



THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 73 



is a fish dinner: so after sincerely thanking you 
for your good wishes, I do not see that we can do 
better than follow the example of the fishes, who 
drink a good deal, but never speak." 



COLD ROCK FISH, SOUSED. 

41. Extract the bones from the cold 
fish which may have been left from dinner. 
Season the fish with Cayenne pepper, salt, 
a few grains of allspice, one or two cloves, 
and a sprig of mace. Put the fish into a 
deep dish. Boil enough vinegar to cover 
the fish, and pour it over boiling hot. In 
twelve hours it will be fit for the table. 

" HAVEN'T you finished scaling that fish yet, 
Sam?" "No, master, 'tis a very large one." 
" Large one 1 why you've had time enough to scale 
a mountain." 



BOILED HERRINGS. 

42. Put them into boiling water with a 
wineglassful of vinegar and a tablespoonful 



74 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of salt, and simmer ten minutes ; serve on 
a napkin, with sauce in a tureen. 



POTTED HERRING. 

43. Clean your herring, wash them 
well and wipe them dry; then rub each 
one with salt and Cayenne pepper; place 
in your jar a layer of herring, then some 
grains of allspice, half a dozen cloves, and 
two or three blades of mace; then put in 
another layer of herring, and so on till all 
are in ; cover the herring with cold vinegar, 
tie up the jar closely with several thick- 
nesses of paper, and set it in the oven 
after the bread has been drawn out ; let it 
remain there all night. As soon as they 
become cold they will be fit for use. 

THOUGH sometimes small evils like invisible in- 
sects, inflict pain, and a single hair may stop a vast 
machine, yet the chief secret of comfort lies in not 
suffering trifles to vex one, and in prudently culti- 
vating an undergrowth of small pleasures since 
very few great ones, alas ! are let on long leases. 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 75 

HERRING, FRIED. 

44. Scale, wash and dry your herrings 
well ; lay them separately on a board, and 
set them to the fire two or three minutes 
before you want to use them ; dust the fish 
with flour, and when your lard is boiling 
hot, put in the fish, a few at a time, and 
fry them over a brisk fire. 



FRESH HERRINGS. 

45. Cut off the heads, and well clean 
the herrings ; place them on a gridiron 
over a bright fire, and broil for ten or 
twelve minutes, according to size ; serve 
very hot, with the following sauce in a 
tureen : 

MUSTARD SAUCE FOR RED HERRING. 
Knead a dessertspoonful of baked flour 
and a teaspoonful of flour of mustard with 
three ounces of butter, and stir into a gill 
of boiling water ; boil five minutes ; add a 
teaspoonful of vinegar, and serve. 



76 THE YOUNG TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

AN Irish footman, who got a situation at the 
west end of London, on entering a room where 
there was a vase of gold fish, exclaimed, " Well, 
this is the first time I ever saw red herrings alive." 



BAKED HERRINGS. 

46. Take off the heads of six herrings ; 
put them into a deep dish and season with 
a saltspoonful of pepper, a teaspoonful of 
salt, a quarter of a grain of Cayenne, two 
cloves, four allspice, six pepper-corns, a 
blade of mace, half an inch of bruised 
ginger, and a teaspoonful of grated horse- 
radish; add a gill of cold water and a 
gill of good vinegar. Bake in a slow 
oven for half an hour. Serve cold, with 
the sauce strained, and a teaspoonful of 
finely chopped chives added. 

" BOY, how did you manage to get such a big 
string of fish?" "I hooked them, sirl"

CROQUETTES OF PISH. 

47. Take dressed fish of any kind, sepa- 
rate it from the bones, mince it with a 
little seasoning, an egg beaten with a tea- 
spoonful of flour, and one of milk; roll 
it into balls; brush the outside with egg, 
and dredge it well with bread crumbs ; fry 
them of a nice color; the bones, heads, 
tails, with an onion, an anchovy, and a 
pint of water, stewed together, will make 
the gravy. Lobsters make delicate cro- 
quettes; in which case the shell should 
be broken and boiled down for the gravy. 



DR. SHARP, of Hart Hall, Oxford, had a ridicu- 
lous manner of prefacing every thing he said with 
the words, "I say." An undergraduate having, as 
the doctor was informed, mimicked him in this pe- 
culiarity, he sent for him to give him a lecturing 
which he thus began : " I say, they say, you say, I 
say, I say." When, finding the ridiculous combina- 
tion in which his speech was involved, he concluded 
by bidding the 3 r oung satirist begone to his room. 



78 THE YOUNG THFE's COOK BOOK. 

A NICE WAY OF SERVING UP ANY KIND 
OF COLD FISH WITH STALE BREAD. 

48. Dip a flat dish in hot water, to pre- 
vent cracking; grease it with butter, and 
sprinkle Cayenne pepper on it then a thick 
layer of stale bread, grated fine ; upon the 
bread place a layer of fish, picked from the 
bones, and divided into small pieces ; an- 
other layer of bread as before, with a little 
melted butter poured over it. Kepeat this 
process as often as required for the quantity 
of fish. Smooth the surface with a spoon, 
and sprinkle slightly with fine bread mixed 
with pepper. Place it in an oven for 
twenty or thirty minutes. Cold mutton 
may be served in the same way. 



A FRENCHMAN had heard the phrase, " I've got 
other fish to fry," uttered by a person who was in a 
hurry and did not wish to be detained. He deter- 

*' 

mined to remember the phrase and its application. 
One day a friend invited him to go and walk ; and, 
being otherwise engaged, he thought of the above 
expression, and gave it thus " Excuse me to-day, 
sare, / must go and fry some fish /" 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 79 

FISH FRITTERS. 

49. Take the remains of any fish which 
has been served the preceding day, remove 
all the bones, and pound it in a mortar. 
Add bread crumbs and mashed potatoes in 
equal quantities. Mix together half a tea- 
cupful of cream with two well-beaten eggs, 
some Cayenne pepper, and anchovy sauce. 
Beat all up to a proper consistency, cut into 
small cakes, and fry them in boiling lard. 

IN one of oar city schools, not many j^ears ago, 
a member of the committee asked a member of a 
class which was under examination, " What was the 
cause of the saltness of the ocean?" Soon one 
little girl raised her head, flushed with the dis- 
covery which had flashed upon her mind. " You 
may tell," said the corninitteeinan. "Satifish, sir," 
said the pupil. 



CAKES OR BALLS MADE FROM COLD COD 

FISH. 

50. Take out all the bones, and mash 
it up with an equal quantity of potatoes. 
Season highly with Cayenne pepper and

salt. Add as much beaten egg as will form 
a paste. Make it out into thin cakes, flour 
them, and fry them to a fine brown. Any 
cold fish may be dressed in this manner. 



IF order were observed for every one to mend his

door ! 



SALTED COD FISH. 

51. Wash it, and soak it all night. 
.15oil it in fresh water until it is done, but 
<i.'. iv>t let it fall to pieces. It should be 
served with mashed potatoes. It is usual 
to season with Cayenne pepper and mustard 
after it comes to the table. 



WHEN Lord Erskinc was Chancellor, being asked 
by the Secretary of the Treasury whether he would

A NICE DISH FROM FRAGMENTS OF COLD 

FISH. 

52. Take the cold fish, separate it from 
the bones, and cut into small pieces. Ob- 
tain oysters, in number proportioned to the 
quantity of fish. Stew them slowly in their 
own liquor for two or three minutes ; take 
them out with a spoon; skim the liquor, 
and pour it into a basin. Put a bit of but- 
ter into the stew-pan, melt it, and add as 
much bread crumbs as will dry it up ; then 
put the oyster liquor into the pan with the 
butter and crumbs, and give it a boil. Put 
the cold fish into scallop shells that have 
been previously buttered and strewed with 
bread crumbs ; add a couple of oysters to 
each ; divide the oyster liquor between the 
different shells, cover with bread crumbs, 
and drop bits of butter on the top of each. 
Then brown in a Dutch oven. The whole 
may be prepared at once in a large flat dish, 
instead of the scallop shells. Those who 
like a particularly keen relish may add

anchovy, catchup, Cayenne, grated lemon- 
peel, mace, or other condiments, to taste. 

THE prolificacy of edible fish, is a subject fitted, 
for the most evident reasons, to call forth our wonder 
and thankfulness toward a beneficent Providence. 
Lewenhock, the physiologist, counted 9,384,000 eggs 
in a cod, 36,900 in a herring, 38,2Y8 in a smelt, 546,681 
in a mackerel, 225,568 in a flounder, 1,355,400 in a 
plaice, 100,000 in a sole, in a carp 3,685,760, and in 
a trench 300,000. 



FRIED OYSTEBS. 

53. Select the largest oysters for frying. 
Take them out of their liquor with a fork, 
and endeavor in doing so to rinse off all 
the particles of shell which may adhere to 
them. Dry them between napkins. Have 
ready some grated cracker, seasoned with 
Cayenne pepper and salt. Beat the yolks 
only of some eggs, and to each egg add 
half a tablespoonful of thick cream Dip 
the oysters, one at a time, first in the egg 
then in the cracker crumbs, and fry them 
in plenty of hot butter, or butter and lard 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 83 

mixed, till they are of a light brown on 
both sides. Serve them hot. 



PICKLED OYSTERS. 

54. Have ready two and a half quarts 
of oysters, with a full pint of their liquor. 
To this quantity take one and a half pints 
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, and 
a tablespoonful of mace, one tablespoonful 
of allspice, the same quantity of white 
pepper, and a teaspoonful of cloves. Put 
the vinegar, salt, and liquor on to boil, and 
when it comes to a boil, skim it ; then add 
the spices, give it another boil up, and 
after this put in the oysters. Be careful 
they do not burn. They must be cooked 
over a quick fire. They must be served 
cold.

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

55. Take one hundred oysters out of 
their liquor, and add to them as much 
water as there was liquor. Put them over 
the fire with salt to the taste, skim them, 
and as soon as they boil take them off. 
Have ready in a pan one gill of vinegar, 
one tablespoonful of allspice, one table- 
spooiiful of pepper grains, a little Cayenne 
pepper and mace, and half a gill of pepper. 
They should be pickled the day before 
they are eaten. After standing a few 
hours, if a scum should have risen on 
them, take out the oysters, and strain the 
liquor. About six hours before they are 
to be served, slice a lemon and add to 
them. 

ONE of our young bloods, dining at a fashionable 
hotel a few weeks since, was requested by a gentle- 
man to pass some article of food that was near him. 
"Do you mistake me for a waiter ?" said the ex- 
quisite. "No, sir, I mistook you for a gentleman,'' 
was the reply.

OYSTER OMELET, No, 1. 

56. Beat four eggs very light. Cut 
the hard part out of eight or a dozen oys- 
ters, according to their size, wipe them dry, 
and cut them up in small pieces, stir them 
into the beaten egg and fry them in hot 
butter. When the under side is brown, 
sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the 
top, and fold one half over the other. 
Never turn an omelet, as it makes it 
heavy. 

LET not thy recreations be expensive, lest the 
pain of purchasing them exceed the pleasure thou 
hast in their enjo} T ment. 



OYSTER OMELET, No. 2. 

57. Beat six eggs to a thick froth, then 
add by degrees one gill of cream, and beat 
them well together. Season the eggs with 
pepper and salt to taste. Have ready one 
dozen fine oysters, cut them in half, pour 
the eggs in a pan of hot butter, and drop 



86 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

the oysters over it as equally as possible. 
Fry it a light brown, and serve hot. An 
omelet should never be turned. 

IN a certain School, during the parsing lesson, 
the word waif occurred in the sentence. The 
youngest who was up, a bright-ej^ed little fellow, 
puzzled over the word for a few minutes, and then 
a bright idea struck him " I can parse it. Posi- 
tive waif, comparative wafer, superlative sealing- 
wax 1" 



OYSTER OMELET, No. 3. 

58. Eight oysters chopped fine, six 
eggs, a wineglassful of flour, a little milk, 
with pepper and salt, to the taste. Beat 
the eggs very light, add the oysters and the 
flour, which must be mixed to a paste with 
a little milk. Pepper and salt to the taste. 
Fry in hot butter, but do not turn it. As 
soon as it is done, slip it on a dish and 
serve it hot. The above is the usual mode 
of preparing oyster omelet. But the better 
way is to put your oysters in a stew-pan, 
set them over the fire, and the moment 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 87 

they begin to boil take them out, drain 
them, and dry them in a napkin. They 
are not so watery when prepared in this 
manner, and consequently will not dilute 
the beaten egg as much as the former mode. 
When they are cold, mince them and pro- 
ceed as above. 

ONE of our writers asks what sort of animals are 
the laziest. We think it likely that ovsters are. for

they never get out of their beds till they are pulled 
out. 



SCALLOPED OYSTEES. 

59. Drain your oysters and season them 
with salt and Cayenne pepper; crumb 
some stale bread, and season it with salt 
and pepper. To each gill of the bread 
crumbs add one hard boiled egg, finely 
chopped ; butter a deep dish, strew in a 
layer of egg and crumbs, then a layer of 
the oysters, with some lumps of butter on 
them, then more crumbs, and so on till all 
are in. Put a cover of crumbs on the top. 



THE YOUNG TTTFE'S COOK BOOR 



Bake this in a tolerable quick oven and 
serve it hot. 

LOSE no time ; be always employed in some- 
thing useful : cut off all unnecessary actions. 



STEWED OYSTERS WITH CREAM. 

60. Rinse one hundred oysters, and 
put them in a stew pan with the water 
which adheres to them ; season them with 
salt and Cayenne pepper, and a very little 
mace. As soon as they begin to boil pour 
in half a pint of cream, and stir in half 
an ounce of butter rolled in a little grated 
cracker. Let them boil once and serve 
them hot. 



PLAIN OYSTER PATTIES. 

61. Make little round loaves, or take 
small French rasps make a hole in the 
top of each, and scrape out a portion of the 
crumb. Put some oysters into a stew-pan 



THE YOUNG TVIFE's COOK BOOK. S9 

with their own liquor, and add to them the 
crumbs of bread, rubbed or grated fine, and 
a lump of butter. Season with black pep- 
per and a sprinkle of Cayenne. Stew for 
five or six minutes, and then put in a 
spoonful of good cream. Fill the rasps or 
loaves, and cover with the bits of crust 
previously cut off. Set them in an oven for 
a few minutes to crisp. 

Minced veal, lamb, poultry, game, etc., 
may be done in the same way as for paste 
patties. 

" BRING in the oysters I told 3^011 to open," 
said the head of the household, growing impatient. 
" There they are," replied the country cook, proudly ; 
"it took me a long while to clean 'em, but I've done 
it at last, and thrown all the insides into the slop 
bucket." 



11 1 KNOW a genius," observed Meister Karl, " who 
has an howdacious plan of opening oysters. He 
spreads 'em in a circle, seats himself in the centre, 
and begins spinning a yarn. Sometimes it's a lion- 
slaying adventure sometimes a legend of his love 
sometimes a descent into the crater of Vesuvius. 
As he proceeds the oj^sters get interested ; one by 
one they gape with astonishment at the tremendous 
whoppers which are poured forth, and as they gape 
my friend whips them out and swallows them!" 



90 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

"That'll do," said Starlight, with a long sigh ; "I 
wish we had a bushel of 'em here now they'd open 
easy J" 



OYSTER PIE. 

62. Take one hundred oysters out of 
their liquor, one at a time, so as to free 
them from any portions of the shell which 
might adhere to them. Drain, and place 
them between clean napkins, in order to 
dry them perfectly. Pour off half the liquor 
into a stew-pan, salt it to your taste, stir in 
one gill of cream, one ounce and a half of 
butter rolled in grated cracker, and a little 
Cayenne pepper. Boil two eggs hard, chop 
them up, and mix them with as many 
bread crumbs as will cover the top of your 
pie. Season the bread and egg with Cay- 
enne pepper and salt. Make a rich paste, 
line the sides of your pie dish, put in the 
oysters, pour the hot liquor over them, 
and strew the bread crumbs on the top. 
Cover the whole with a lid of paste. Cut 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S OOOK BOOK. 

an opening in the centre of the tap crust, 
and ornament it with flowers or leaves 
made of the paste. Bake it and serve it 
hot. As soon as the crust is done take the 
pie out of the oven. 

A LEARNED CLERGYMAN in Maine was accosted 
in the following manner by an illiterate preacher 
who despised education : " Sir, you have been to 
college I suppose?" "Yes, sir," was the reply. 
" I am thankful," replied the former, " that the Lord 
has opened my mouth without any learning." "A 
similar event," replied the latter, "took place in 
Balaam's time ; but such things are of rare occur- 
rence in the present day." 



TERRAPINS. 

63. Put the terrapins on in boiling 
water and let them boil ten minutes, take 
them out and with a coarse cloth rub all 
the skin off the head, neck, and claws, 
also the thin shell that may come loose. 
Then boil them in clean water, with a 
little salt in it, until the claws are perfectly 
soft. The time of boiling depends very 
much on the age of the terrapin; some 



92 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

take three hours. When they are soft, 
open them carefully, take out the sand- 
bag, the spongy part, and the gall, which 
you must not break. Cut all the remain- 
der of the terrapin in small pieces, put 
them in a stew pan, and to each large 
terrapin take a quarter of a pound of 
butter, one wine glass of Sherry or Ma- 
deira wine, salt, black, and red pepper, 
and mustard, to suit the taste ; also, to 
each terrapin, the yolks of two hard boiled 
eggs, mashed to a paste, with a little 
butter. Mix the whole together, and stew 
fifteen minutes. Send them to the table 
hot. 



LOBSTER SALAD. 

64. One large lobster, three tablespoon- 
fuls of French mustard, or two dessert- 
spoonfuls of common mixed mustard, one 
gill and a half of vinegar, one gill and a 
half of sweet oil, the yolks of five hard 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 93 

boiled eggs, salt to taste, a small teaspoon- 
ful of Cayenne pepper, the inside leaves 
of two heads of cabbage lettuce. Cut the 
meat and lettuce in small pieces. Boil the 
eggs hard, mash the yolks with a wooden 
or silver spoon. 

WHO is he that hath acquired wealth, that hath 
risen to power, that hath clothed himself with 
honor, that is spoken of in the city with praise, 
and that standeth before the king in his counsel? 
Even he that hath shut out idleness from his house, 
and hath said, Sloth, thou art mine enemy. 



TO MAKE A NICE RELISH OUT OF FRAG- 
MENTS OF COLD LOBSTER OR CRAB. 

65. It often happens after lobster or 
crab suppers or luncheons, that legs and 
claws, and portions of the back are left 
untouched. Collect all the fragments of 
fish, and put with them two blades of 
mace, a little pepper and salt, and a small 
portion of butter; the quantity of the 
latter must be proportioned to the amount 



94 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of lobster. Put these all together, and beat 
them into a paste in a mortar. Take small 
jars and fill these with the prepared lob- 
ster. If there are any solid parts of the 
tail, which cannot well be reduced to a 
paste, they may be cut into small pieces, 
and set in the middle of the jars, and the 
paste poured over them. When the jars 
are nearly filled, press down the contents, 
pour over them a layer of clarified butter, 
or lard. This will afford a nice relish 
for breakfast, luncheon, or supper. If in- 
tended to be kept for some time, tie down 
with pieces of thick paper. 

A YOUNG lady at a ball was asked by a lover of 
serious poetry, whether she had seen " Grabbers 
Tales ?" " Why, no," she answered, " I didn't know 
that crabs had tails." "I beg your pardon, miss," 
said he ; "I mean have you read Crabbe's Tales ?" 
" I assure you, sir, I was not aware that red crabs 
had tails nor any other."

MEATS, POULTRY, GAME, 

ETC. 

MEATS. 

66. The finest grained beef is the best, 

the flesh is of a fine red, and the fat a light 

cream color, but not yellow ; the fat ; too, 

is solid and firm ; the lean of mutton 

should be of a red color, and the fat white ; 

the lean of veal should be of a light color, 

and the fat white ; the skin of pork should 

be of a light color, and if young it is 

tender ; the fat should appear firm ; a 

tender goose is known by taking hold of 

the wing and raising it ; if the skin tears 

easily the goose is tender, or if you can 

readily insert the head of a pin into the 

flesh it is young; the same remarks will 

hold good with regard to ducks; young 

chickens may be known by pressing the 

lower end of the breast bone ; if it yields 

readily to the pressure they are not old, 



96 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

for in all animals the bones are cartilaginous 
when young ; the breast should be broad 
and plump in all kinds of poultry, the feet 
pliable, and the toes easily broken when 
bent back. 

A SERVANT was sent by her mistress during 
warm weather, for a piece of beef. The butcher 
forwarded it in due course ; but, on removing a 
portion of the suet, the indications of life which 
presented themselves were unmistakable. jSext 
day the same girl was sent for a leg of lamb. 
"Are you sure it is sweet?" she inquired. "Per- 
fectly," said the butcher, " the lamb was alive j : es- 
terday." " So was the beef we had yesterday," was 
the reply. 



BOILED MEATS. 

67. A great deal of care and niceness 
is requisite in boiling meats. Your copper 
should be very clean and well tinned. All 
meats should be boiled slowly ; to boil them 
fast hardens the outside before the inside 
is warm, and dissolves the meat. For 
instance, a leg of veal of twelve pounds 
weight will require three hours and a half 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 97 

boiling the slower it boils the whiter and 
plumper it will be. When you boil mut- 
ton or beef, observe to dredge them well 
with flour before you put them into the 
kettle of cold water ; keep it covered, and 
take off the scum. Mutton and beef do 
not require so much boiling, but veal, pork, 
or lamb, are not wholesome if they are 
not boiled enough. A leg of pork will 
require half an hour more of boiling than 
a leg of veal of the same weight. You 
must allow an hour for every four pounds 
weight of beef or mutton. The best way 
is to put your meat in when the water is 
cold. A leg of lamb of four pounds, 
weight will require an hour and a half 
boiling. 



BEEF ROAST BEEF, RIBS, OR SIRLOIN. 

68. Beef should be kept a week or ten 
days when the weather will permit. Wipe 
the joint with a clean cloth, envelope it in

98 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

thin paper, thickly spread with sweet beef- 
dripping ; place the screen before the fire 
half an hour before putting clown the beef, 
hang the joint before the fire for the first 
quarter of an hour near; baste ; then with- 
draw it to a distance, and let it roast 
slowly till done ; baste frequently from 
the commencement; half an hour before 
serving take off the paper, dredge the beef 
slightly with 'ba'ked flour, and baste it with 
two ounces of dissolved butter; place the 
beef on a hot dish ; pour the dripping off; 
add a teacupful of boiling water and half 
a salt-spoonful of salt to the gravy dripped 
from the beef; pour it into the dish ; gar- 
nish with horseradish, and serve at once. 
The time as follows : To be underdone, 
eleven minutes to the pound ; with the 
gravy in, fourteen minutes ; to be well 
done through, seventeen minutes ; in frosty 
weather, two minutes to be added in each 
case. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 99 

THERE are seven chances against even the most 
simple dish being presented to the mouth in abso- 
lute perfection. For instance, a roast of beef 

1. The meat must be good. 

2. It must have been kept a good time. 

3. It must be roasted at a good fire. 

4. By a good cook. 

5. Who must be in good temper. 

6. With all this felicitous combination you must 
have good luck, and 

7. Good appetite, the meat and the mouths which 
are to eat it must be ready for action at the same 
moment. 



BAKED BEEF, AND YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

69. Rub salt on a nice piece of beef, put 
it on bars which should fit jour dripping 
pan, set it in the oven, with a gill of water 
in the pan, and when it is half done, make 
the pudding in the following manner : Beat 
four eggs very light; the yolks in a pan, 
the whites in a broad dish. When the 
yolks are thick stir in a pint of milk, and 
as much flour as will make a batter, but 
not a thick one. Then stir in the whites, 
which must be whisked very dry, do not 



7994584 



100 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

beat the batter after the white is in; lastly, 
stir in a teaspoonful of dissolved carbonate 
of ammonia. Take out the meat, skim 
all the fat off the gravy, pour in the batter 
and replace the meat; put all into the 
oven again, and cook it till the pudding 
is done. You should make batter enough 
to cover your dripping pan about half an 



inch deep. When the meat is dished, cut 
the pudding in squares, and place it round 
the dish, the brown side up. 

SILENT CONTEMPT. " What do you mean to do 
with K. ?" said a friend to Theodore Hook, alluding 
to a man who had grossly vilified him. " Do with 
him ;" replied Hook, "why I mean to let him alone 
most severely." 

* 



BEEF A-LA-MODE, No, 1. 

70. A round of beef is the best for this 
purpose. With a sharp knife cut incisions 
in the meat about an inch apart, and within 
one inch of the opposite side. Season it 
with pepper and salt, according to the size 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 101 

of the piece of meat. Make a dressing of 
butter, onion, and bread crumbs, in the 
proportion of a pint of crumbs, one small 
onion finely chopped, and an ounce of but- 
ter, with pepper and salt to the taste. Fill 
the incisions with the dressing, put the 
meat in a pot with about a pint of water, 
and cover it tightly. Let it simmer six or 
eight hours. Some stick in a few cloves, 
and those who are fond of spice add all- 
spice. When the meat is done dish it up, 
and thicken the gravy with a little flour. 
Let it boil once, and serve it. This is ex- 
cellent when cold. 

BE not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents, com- 
mon or unavoidable.

bacon ; then make a dressing of bread, but 
ter, sweet herbs, onion, parsley, salt and 
pepper, and stuff around the bone, and in

several places in the lean part skewer it, 
and bind it close with tape. Have ready a 
deep pot put the beef into it, and half 
cover it with water. Stew it four or five 
hours. Baste it constantly with the gravy, 
and turn it in the pot. When done, place 
it upon a dish and garnish it with force- 
meat balls, parsley, and carrots. Pour the 
gravy over it, having been previously 
flavored with Madeira wine. 

LET him that scoffeth at the lame, take care that 
he halt not himself. Whosoever speaketh of 
another's failings with pleasure, shall hear of his 
own with bitterness of heart. 



BOILED CORNED BEEF, No. 1. 

72. Put on the meat in cold water; 
allow one quart of water to every pound of 
meat. The slower it boils the better it will 
be. For every pound of meat, let it boil 
fifteen minutes. Thus, a piece of beef 
weighing twelve pounds, should boil three 
hours. If the beef is to be eaten cold, as 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 103 

soon as it is taken out of the pot immerse 
it in cold water for a short time, in order to 
retain the juices. Tongues are boiled in 
the same manner.

CORNED BEEF, BTo. 2. 

73. Corned beef should be put on in 
cold water, allowing a quart of water to 
every pound of meat. Boil it slowly, and 
when done serve it with turnips and po- 
tatoes. If the beef is to be eaten cold, im- 
merse it for a few minutes in cold water as 
soon as it is taken from the pot. 

" WILL you dine with me to-morrow, Mr. ?" 

asked one Irishman of another. " Faith and I will, 
with all my heart." " Remember, 'tis only a family 
dinner I'm asking you to." "And what for not ; a 
family dinner is a mighty pleasant thing. What 
have you got ?" " Och, nothing uncommon an ele- 
gant piece of corned beef, and potatoes." " By the 
powers, that bates the world; my favorite dinner; 
we often have it at our table barrin' the beef! 11

ROASTED BEEF'S TONGUE, 

74. Soak a fresh tongue for several 
hours in strong salt and water, and then 
drain it well. Boil it slowly for two hours, 
take off the skin and roast it, and while 
cooking haste it with butter. Serve with 
currant jelly. 

ONE morning a party came into the public rooms 
at Buxton, somewhat later than usual, and re- 
quested some tongue. They were told that Lord 
Byron had eaten it all. " I am very angry with 
his lordship," said a lady, loud enough for him to 
hear the observation. " I am sorry for it, madam," 
retorted Lord Byron, " but before I ate the tongue 
I was assured you did not want it." 



BEEF'S HEART, STUFFED. 

75. Trim and clean the heart, and 
sprinkle salt over it, and let it stand for 
two or three hours to draw out all the 
blood. The water should be changed two 
or three times. Then wipe it dry, and fill 
with a dressing made of crumbs 
pper, salt, and a little onion 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 105 

chopped fine. Put to this as much butter 
as will make the crumbs adhere together. 
Set it in a moderate oven and bake it, 
allowing a quarter of an hour for each 
pound. If convenient, it is better roasted 
before the fire. 

THERE are some members of the community that 
are like the crumb in the mouth if they go the 
right way they afford a little nourishment, but if 
they happen to go the wrong way they cause a deal 
of trouble. 



BEEF, LIKE GAME. 

76. Cut some slices of beef into square 
pieces, put on each a strip of bacon, dredge 
flour over, bind each with twine, or skewer 
them into a rolled shape. Fry them in 
butter. When brown, add shalots, a slice 
of lemon-peel, a spoonful of capers, two 
bay-leaves, salt, spice, a glassful of w r ine, 
half a glassful of vinegar, and a little 
water. Stew till done.

ITALIAN BEEFSTEAK. - ; 

77. Score a steak transversely with a 
sharp knife without cutting it through. 
Lay it in a stew-pan with a small piece 
of butter; season with pepper, salt, and 
an onion chopped very fine. Let it cook 
in its own gravy for about three-quarters 
of an hour and serve. 

To TAKE RUST OUT OP STEEL. Cover the steel 
with sweet oil, well rubbed on it, and in forty-eight 
hours use unslaked lime finely powdered, to rub 
until all the rust disappears. 



STEWED BEEFSTEAKS. 

78. Put the steak with a lump of butter 
into a stew pan over a slow fire, and turn 

* 

it until the butter has become a fine white 
gravy, then pour it into a basin, and put 
more butter to the steak. When the steak 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 107 

is nicely done, take it out, return all the 
gravy into the stew-pan, and fry the steak ; 
then add it to the gravy in the stew-pan, 
with a tablespoonful of wine, and a shalot 
finely sliced ; stew it for ten minutes, and 
serve it up. Or, fry the steak slightly at 
first, then put it into half a pint of water, 
an onion sliced, a spoonful of walnut 
ketchup, pepper and salt, cover it close, 
thicken it with flour and butter, and serve 
it up very hot. 

FORGET not, man, that thy station on earth is 
appointed by the wisdom of the Eternal ; who know- 
eth thy heart, who seeth the vanity of thy wishes,

BEEFSTEAK WITH OYSTERS, 

79. Cut the steak rather thick ; brown 
it in a frying-pan with butter. Add half a 
pint of water, an onion sliced, pepper and 
salt, cover the pan close, and let it stew 
very slowly for one hour ; then add a glass 



108 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of port wine, a little flour, and a dozen or 
two of oysters, their liquor having been 
previously strained and put into the stew- 
pan. 



BEEFSTEAK, WITH POTATOES. 

80. Cut the steaks into thin slices, beat 
and season them with pepper and salt, dip 
them into a little melted butter and broil 
them. When done, put them into a dish 
before the fire, and fry potatoes to a fine 
brown color. Serve with the following mix- 
ture laid underneath ; parsley chopped fine, 
a small piece of butter, pepper and salt. 

SHORTLY after the commencement of the last war, 
a tax was laid on caudles, which, as a political 
economist would prove, made them dearer. A 
Scotch wife, in Greenock, remarked to her chandler, 
Paddy Macbeth, that the price was raised, and 
asked why. " It's owiu' to the wars," said Paddy. 
" The war!" said the astonished matron, " gracious

FRIED BEEFSTEAK WITH WINE. 

81. Fry the steak over a quick fire, 
until it is of a fine brown. When done, 

place it in a hot dish before the fire, add to 
the gravy in the pan a wineglassful of port 
wine, some pepper and salt. As soon as it 
boils, pour it over the steak and serve very 
hot. 

HAPPINESS, like every other precious good must 
be sought for. Some people, to be sure, are born 
like sunshine they are naturally pleasant and light- 
hearted ; but these are few and far between, and 
always monopolized. Emulate them. Why may 
not you be as cheerful as they ? They have their 
trials and private annoj'ances as well as you, and 
with effort you can cull as many flowers and catch 
as many sunbeams as they. 



BEEFSTEAK FRIED. 

82. Fry the steaks in butter for twelve 
or fifteen minutes, until they are of a fine 
brown. When done, place them in a hot 
dish before the fire ; add to the gravy in 
the pan a wineglassful of port wine, pepper, 



110 TIIE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

salt, and a minced onion. Give it a boil 
up, pour it over the steaks, and serve 
very hot. 

NOTHING serves more effectually to lighten the 
calamities of life than steady employment. 



FRENCH STEW, No. 1. 

83. Cut up one pound of beef in small 
pieces about an inch square, pare and slice 
six onions ; put a layer of the meat and a 
layer of onions in a stew-pan, with salt and 
pepper and a little flour alternately, till all 
is in, and add half a teacupful of water; 
cover it closely and set it on a slow fire to 
stew; when about half done, if the gravy 
seems too thin, add one ounce of butter 
rolled in flour; but if it should be thick 
enough, add the butter without the flour. 
When tomatoes are in season two tomatoes 
may be cut in small pieces and stewed with 
the meat. Cold beef may be cooked in the 
same manner.

EXCESSIVE POLITENESS. Queen Elizabeth was 
once making a journey in England, and on her ap- 
proaching the city of Coventry, the mayor, with a 
numerous cavalcade, went out to meet her. On 
their return they had to pass through a wide brook, 
and the mayor's horse, being thirsty, attempted 
several times to drink, but his cavalier prevented 
him. The queen, observing it, said to him : " Pray, 
Mr. Mayor, permit your horse to drink." The mayor, 
bowing, very humbly, replied : " Madam, it would 
be the height of presumption for my unworthy 
horse to drink, till your majesty's royal steed has 
satisfied his thirst." 



FRENCH STEW, No. 2. 

84:. Cut up two pounds of beef, and 
add to it a pint of sliced tomatoes. The 
tomatoes must be peeled. Put the meat in 
a stew-pan and season it well with pepper 
and salt; then add your tomatoes, and an 
ounce of butter rolled in flour. Cover it 
closely, and let it simmer till the beef is 
tender. It does not require any water, as 
the tomatoes are sufficiently juicy. If the 
gravy should not be thick enough, add a 
little flour mixed with cold water.

WHY is French cookery better than English? 
Because in the Revolution of 1088 the Stew-arts

BEEFSTEAK WITH CUCUMBERS. 

85. Pare and slice lengthwise two large 
cucumbers and a large onion. Season them 
with pepper and salt, dredge flour over 
them, and fry them. Broil a steak, season 
it with pepper and salt, and put it into a 
hot dish with a bit of butter; then pour 
the cucumbers over it, and serve hot.

BEEF'S KIDNEY, FRIED. 

86. Kidneys require a longer time to 
dress, in proportion to their bulk, than any 
other parts of animals ; and beef kidneys 
more than those of sheep, lambs, etc. Beef 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 113 

kidneys may be fried in the following man- 
ner : Trim, and cut the kidney into slices ; 
dredge them well with flour, and season 
with salt, pepper, and Cayenne. Fry on 
both sides ; and as the slices are done, re- 
move them from the pan, and make a gravy 
with a small slice of butter, a dessert-spoon- 
ful of flour, pepper, and salt, and a little 
boiling water. Add a little mushroom 
catchup, lemon-juice, walnut pickle, or any 
sauce that will impart a good flavor. Some 
add to the gravy, at the last moment, a 
glass of white wine. Serve with small 
slices of fried bread. 



NICE PATTIES FROM UNDER-DONE BEEF.

UNDER-DONE BEEF SERVED AS STEAKS. 

88. Cut the meat in slices an inch and 
a half thick, securing a good proportion of 
fat. Lay them on a gridiron over a good 
fire ; turn often, but do not stick a fork into 
them. As soon as brown, lay them on a 
very hot dish, and add salt and pepper, and 
pour over some hot gravy of the joint. If 
the seasoning is added while the meat is 
being boiled, the latter will be hardened 
and the pieces wasted. The steaks will be 
found excellently served with sliced fried 
potatoes round it, 

Two GENTLEMEN were talking in a coffee-house 
of the best method of dressing a beefsteak. One 
of them observed, that, of all receipts, the one given 
in the words of Macbeth, when he deliberates on the 
intended death of the king, is the best : 

" If it were done, when 'tis clone, then 'twere well 
it were done quickly."

BEOILED BEEF'S HEART. 

89. Cut the heart lengthwise, in slices 
not thicker than half an inch. Soak them 
in salt and water until all the blood is 
drawn out ; then wipe them dry, and sea- 
son well with pepper and salt. Broil them 
slowly, over or before a clear fire; and 
when thoroughly done they should be 
served with currant jelly. 



HASHES. 

90. A hash is a very convenient mode 
of disposing of cold meat, but without due 
attention is an indigestible preparation. 
The cook must always remember that the 
meat has been once cooked, and must now 
be very lightly done, or it will be tough 
and hard, unsuited for delicate stomachs. 
Meat that has been a little underdone the 
first time is the best for this purpose ; the 
gravy should be first heated, and the meat 



116 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

merely simmered in it afterwards. The 
meat should be cut in thin slices, or small 
pieces, then all the sinews, skin, gristle, 
and bone, must be put into a saucepan with 
a little water, salt and pepper, a fried 
onion, a small piece of butter blended with 
a tablespoonful of flour, a little thyme and 
parsley, and a single clove, if the hash be 
beef. Let it boil down to three fourths of 
the quantity, then strain off the gravy, and 
flavor it with a little ketchup or Worcester 
sauce, put in the sliced meat, and make it 
hot over the fire, taking great care that it 
does not boil, and serve with toasted bread. 
No flavor or condiment should unduly pre- 
dominate in this or any other kind of 
cookery; especially, to allow onions or 
garlic to be perceptible is an offence against 
good taste, the laws of cookery, and even 
those of health. The mushroom flavor is 
the most approved and delicate in what 
are called made dishes, yet it should always 
be so sklfully used, that only the aroma 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 117 

should be distinguished. This should be 
particularly attended to in all dishes com- 
posed of veal or fowls. 

A MAID servant was dismissed on account of her 
lack of cleanliness. She requested her employer, 
if the cause of her dismissal should be mentioned, 
to do it in as light terms as possible. The follow- 
ing certificate was given to her : " Anna B has 

conducted herself well in my service, the main 
cause of her dismissal being a tendency to hydro- 
phobia. 



BEEF HASHED, A LA FRANCAISE. 

91. Put a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, and a tablespoonful of flour, into a 
stew-pan, simmer them over the fire for a 
minute, and stir into them a finely chopped 
onion and a dessertspoonful of minced 
parsley ; w T hen thoroughly browned, add a 
seasoning of pepper, salt and nutmeg, and 
put to it half a pint of water. Place in 
the beef, cut it into small but thick slices ; 
let it stand by the fire and heat gradually ; 
and when near boiling point, thicken the

with a tablespoonful of lemon juice. 

MAN in his civilized state is supposed to eat more 
than a thousand times in every year of his life. 



COLD BEEF WITH POTATOES, 

92. Take the meat from the bones, and 
cut it in small pieces; crack the bones 
small; put them into a saucepan with some 
salt, and a little more than cover them with 
cold water ; let them stew until the water 
is reduced to one half; strain the bones 
from the gravy ; pour the latter back into 
the stew-pan : season the meat with pepper 
and salt, and a little mace if preferred ; 
put it with the gravy in the stew-pan, and 
add two or three raw potatoes pared and 
sliced; put the stew over the fire, and 
when the potatoes are done dish it up. 

Small squares of toasted bread may be 
laid in the bottom of the dish.

THE following is a good story about a clergyman, 
who lost, his horse one Saturday evening;. After 

*/ O 

hunting for it in company with a boy until midnight, 
he gave up in despair. The next day he took for 
his text the following passage from Job: " Oh, that 
I knew where I might find him !" The boy, who 
had just come in, supposing the horse was still the 
burden of thought, cried out, "I know where he is, 
sir he's in Tom Smith's stable!" 



A DISH FROM COLD BEEF AND MASHED 

POTATOES. 

93. Cut the cold meat into small slices 
about half an inch thick. Season the slices, 
and spread thinly over them some bread 
crumbs and some small lumps of butter. 
Take the gravy left from the joint, or stew 
a gravy from the bones ; thicken it with 
butter rolled in flour, and season it with 
pepper and salt. Or the bits of meat, when 
not large enough to be sliced, as above, 
may be minced, seasoned, and mixed with 
mashed potatoes and flour. Make it into 
small cakes, and fry them a nice brown.

AT a recent festive meeting, a married man (who 
should have known better) proposed "The Ladies: 
AVho divide our sorrows, double our joys, and treble 
our expenses !" 



MINCED BEEF. 

94. Chop some cold roast beef as fine 
as possible, pour over it some of the cold 
gravy which was left, put it over the fire, 
and as soon as it is hot serve it with boiled 
or poached eggs. 

WHATEVER thou resolvest to do, do it quickly. 
Defer not till the evening what the morning may 
accomplish. 



COLD BEEF OR MUTTON WITH POACHED 

EGGS. 

95. Take a piece of a sirloin of beef, 
or of a leg of mutton (these parts are 
recommended, but any other parts may be 
used) cut into slices of equal thickness, 
and boil them quickly over a clear fire until 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK FOOKT. 121 

slightly brown ; lay them upo-n & dish be- 
fore the fire to keep hot ; then poach som& 
eggs and lay around the .meat and serve 
with mashed potatoes. It is proper to ob- 
serve that the under-done parts f meat are 
only suitable for this purpose. 

CHARLES THE SECOND gave the name to the piece- 
of beef called the " sirloin." Having dined from a 

n.* 

loin, and being well pleased with the joint, he as&ed 
its name ; and being told that it wa s a- loin- of beef, 
said jocosely that it should be knighted for Its mer- 
its ; then, extending his sword over it, he sxelaimed, 
"Henceforth be Sir Loin I" 



ECONOMICAL STEW. 

96* Slice some cold beef or 
season the meat with pepper and salt r ancE 
dredge over it a little flour. Put it in a* 
stew-pan with some of the cold gravy j; or,, 
if there be none left, add a little water.. 
Slice an onion fine, and add to it also a few 
potatoes. Stew gently until the meat is* 
quite tender. If there was no cold gravy,,

a little butter rolled in flour must be added 
a few minutes before the stew is served. 

SHERIDAN was once taken ill in consequence of a 
fortnight's continued dining-out and dissipation. He 
sent for Dr. H., who prescribed rigid abstinence ; 
calling again soon afterward, he asked his patient 
if he was attending to that advice. The answer 
being in the affirmative, "Right," said the doctor; 
" 'tis the only way to secure you length of days." 
" I do not doubt it," said Sheridan, " for these last 
three days, since I began, have been the longest to 
me in my life !" 



LUNCH FROM COLD ROAST BEEF. 

97. When the beef has been cooked 
rare, and the bones have considerable meat 
adhering to them, cut them apart, and 
crack or saw each one in pieces about four 
inches long. Grease the gridiron and broil 
them quickly, taking care not to burn them. 
Poached or fried eggs and mashed potatoes 
are suitable accompaniments. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 123 

"RISSOLES" OF COLD BEEF, MUTTON, OR 

VEAL. 

98. Mince some cold beef or mutton, 
season it to the taste with pepper and salt, 
and moisten it with some mushroom or 
walnut catsup. Beat the yolks of a couple 
of eggs, make the meat into small cakes, 
dip them into the egg, and then into some 
nicely-seasoned bread crumbs. Fry them a 
nice light brown on both sides. Cold veal 
may be dressed in the same way, but is 
nicer with a little cold ham grated and 
mixed with it. 

"WHAT a small kitchen!" exclaimed Queen 
Elizabeth, after going over a handsome mansion. 
"It is by having so small a kitchen that I am ena- 
bled to keep so large a mansion," replied the 
owner. 



A NICE DISH FROM COLD BEEF, WITH 
MASHED POTATOES. 

99. Mash potatoes, either in a plain 
way or with hot milk and the yolk of an 
egg, and add some butter and salt. Slice

the cold beef, and lay it at the bottom of a 
pie dish, adding to it some pepper, salt, and 
a little beef gravy. Cover the whole with 
a thick paste of the potatoes. Score the 
potato crust with the point of a knife, in 
squares of equal size. Put the dish in an 
oven and brown it on all sides. When 
nicely browned serve immediately. This, 
with an apple-tart or dumpling to follow, is 
a capital dinner for a small family. 

AN Irish housemaid, who was sent to call a gen- 
tleman to dinner, found him engaged in using a 
tooth-brush. " Well, is he coming ?" said the lady. 
" Yes, ma'am, directly he's just sharpening his 
teeth!" 



METHOD OF DRESSING COLD SIRLOIN OF 

BEEF. 

100. Cut the under-done parts of the 
meat in long narrow slices about an inch 
thick, leaving, if possible, a little fat at- 
tached to each piece. Season with salt and 
mixed spices, dredge with flour, and heat 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 125 

them in gravy from the joint to which a 
little vinegar may be added. The slices 
may be boiled, and served with fried or 
mashed potatoes. 

THERE can be no objection to broils in the house, 
so that they emanate only from the kitchen. 



COLD POTATOES AND BEEF. 

101. Slice the beef and the potatoes ; 
put an onion to a good gravy, either from 
the joint, or stewed from the bones ; let the 
potatoes and beef simmer in the gravy. 
Add vinegar, pepper, and salt. Thicken 
the gravy, and serve hot, with slices of 
toasted bread. 

" MY dear," said a young wife, returning from a 
ball, " I have learned one of the most difficult steps." 
"There is a step," replied the husband, "the most 
valuable of all ; but it is one, I fear, you will never 
care to learn." " Indeed ! what can that be ?" " It 
is to step into the kitchen!"

COLD BEEF, MUTTON OR VEAL, RECOOKED. 

102. Take a pound or more of cold 
meat and chop it very fine ; add a small 
piece of butter, with salt and pepper; mix 
all well together. Boil six fresh eggs 
twenty minutes ; lay them in cold water, 
and take off the shells ; mash the yolks 
very fine and add them to the meat. Make 
it into small cakes, roll them in flour or fine 
bread crumbs, and fry them in butter or 
good lard. 

WHEN you have lost money in the streets, every 
one is ready to help you to look for it ; but when 
you have lost your character, every one leaves you

TURNOVERS OF COLD MEAT. 

103. Cut any kind of cold meat into 
small pieces, and season well with pepper 
and salt, and add a little finely-chopped 
onion if liked. Take some cold potatoes, 
grate them, beat an egg and put to them, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 127 

and dust in as much flour as will form a 
dough. Roll this out about the ordinary 
thickness for pies, put on a portion of this 
paste some of the seasoned meat, fold the 
edges of the paste and pinch them together 
so as to hold the meat, and fry them on 
both sides a fine brown. 



"TOAD IN THE HOLE" FROM COLD MEAT. 
104. Take some rather thick slices of 
cold under-done beef, seasoning with salt 
and pepper. Make a batter by beating the 
whites and yolks separately of four eggs. 
To a pint of milk add the yolks of the eggs, 
and enough flour to make a batter. Lastly 
put in a little salt, and stir in gradually the 

whites of the eggs. Pour the batter into a 
deep baking dish, and lay the meat on the 
top. Set it in the oven and bake it a nice 
brown.

of cold raast beef and tongue. Season well 
with popper and salt, and add the whole or 
a part o f a well-beaten egg, according to the 
quantity of meat. Mix it well, and butter 
a mould ; put in the meat and press it 
down very hard, to acquire the shape of 
the moul d : then turn it out on a baking 
tin, and wash it over with some well-beaten 
egg. Set it in the oven to brown.

and for seasoning use young onions, pepper, 
and salt. Put it in a stew-pan, and as soon 
as it begins to boil it may be served. If 
something a little better is required, add a 
glass of port wine, the yolk of an egg beaten, 
and the juice of a lemon. Stir the fricassee, 
but do not allow it to boil. 

A GOOD housewife should not be a person of one 
idea, but should be familiar with the flower garden 
as well as the flour barrel ; and though her lesson 
should be to lessen expense, the odor of a fine rose 
should not be less valuable than the order of her 
household. She will prefer a yard of shrubbery to 
a yard of satin. If her husband is a skilful sower 
of grain, she is equally skilful as a sewer of gar- 
ments. He keeps his hoes bright by use she keeps 
the hose of the family in order. 



A NICE BREAKFAST, LUNCHEON, OR SUPPER 
RELISH FROM POTTED COLD BEEF. 

107. Having a joint of dressed beef 
which cannot be consumed, proceed in the 
following manner. Drain the meat from 
the gravy, cut it in pieces, and chop it fine. 
Season with pepper, salt, and spices to the

PIE MADE OF COLD ROAST BEEF. 

108. Cut about half a pound of cold 
under-done beef into small pieces ; add 
pepper and salt to the taste. Line a deep 
pie dish with paste; put in a layer of meat. 
Over this strew some finely-minced onion, 
dredge flour over it, then add another layer 
of meat, onion, and flour, till the pie is full. 
Pour in a little water, and on the top layer 
lay some lumps of butter. Cover the top 
with paste, leaving a hole in the centre. 
Bake it, and serve with oyster sauce ; or, 
in place of the onions, layers of oysters 
may be substituted.

QUANTITY OF FOOD. The proper quantity of food 
to be taken at a meal is best regulated by a person's 
own feelings. If we find that we dined too freel}" 
to-day, to-morrow we should reduce the quantity 
one-third ; and if that is not sufficient, a further 
reduction of a third should be made and so on 
until a proper standard is arrived at. To satisty 
the appetite it is not necessary to eat to repletion, 
but at the conclusion of the meal a person should 
always feel as though he could eat more. 



COLD BEEF HASHED WITH VINEGAR. 

109. Take some cold roast beef, beef- 
steak, or the meat from a shin which has 
been boiled for soup ; cut it in pieces about 
half an inch square; season with Cayenne 
pepper and salt to the taste. Take as much 
vinegar as would cover the meat ; boil in it 
a few grains of whole allspice and a couple 
of cloves ; pour it over the meat while boil- 
ing hot, and stand it away to get cold. 
This is a nice dish for supper or luncheon. 

A PRUDENT wife is a treasure, and an active one

BEEF CAKES. 

110. Take some cold beef that which 
is under-done is the best mince it very 
fine, and grate a little uncooked ham into 
it, enough to flavor it. Season it with 
pepper and salt. Mix the whole together 
and make it out into small cakes, flour 
them, and fry them a nice brown on both 
Bides. 



THE ONLY " COLD SHOULDER" WHICH CAN BE 
SHOWN TO A FRIEND WITHOUT OFFENCE. 

111. A shoulder of lamb, or a part of 
one, being left cold, proceed in the follow- 
ing manner. Score the shoulder in squares, 
rub it with the yolk of an egg, pepper and 
salt it, and rub with bread crumbs and 
sweet herbs. Broil it over a clear fire or 
put it in an oven until nicely browned. 
Send it to table with sauce made of a half 
a pint of gravy, to which has been added 
an ounce of fresh butter rubbed into a table- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 133 

spoonful of flour, the same of mushroom or 
walnut catsup, two teaspoonsful of lemon 
juice, one of black pepper, a quarter of a 
rind of lemon grated very fine, a little Chili 
vinegar, or a few grains of Cayenne sim- 
mer together for a few minutes, pour a little 
of the sauce over the meat, and send up the 
rest in a tureen. The sauce may be sim- 
plified at discretion if the above ingredients 
are not all at hand. A cold shoulder of 
mutton, having only a little meat upon the 
blade bone, may be dressed in the same 
way. Serve with caper sauce poured over 
it, or melted butter, in which should be 
mixed some mushroom catchup and lemon 
juice, about a table-spoonful of each. 

SOMEBODY says, "A wife should be like roasted 
lamb tender, and nicely dressed." An imperti- 
nent fellow adds and "without sauce!" 



134 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

MUTTON CUTLETS WITH PORTUGUESE 

SAUCE, 

112. Take five or six cutlets off the 
best end of a neck of mutton ; trim off the 
fat, bare the bone, and beat the cutlets 
with a chopper. Season two ounces of 
fine crumbs of bread with the eighth part 
of a nutmeg grated, a salt-spoonful of salt, 
half a salt-spoonful of pepper, and a quarter 
of a grain of Cayenne. Dip the cutlets 
into beaten egg (one), then into the crumbs, 
and fry slowly in plenty of boiling fat till 
of a pale brown color, fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Peel and chop fine an onion, a 
large apple, half a clove of garlic, six 
Sultana raisins ; put them into a saucepan 
with a wine-glassful of vinegar, a tea-spoon- 
ful of moist sugar, a table-spoonful of gravy, 
one clove, and four pepper-corns. Simmer 
twenty minutes. Add a wine-glassful of 
port wine ; rub through a sieve ; place the 
cutlets round the dish, and the sauce in the 
centre. Serve immediately.

the church wardens in his diocese a circular of in- 
quiries, among- which was " Does your officiating 
clergyman preach the gospel, and is his conver- 
sation and carriage consistent therewith ?" The 
church wardens of Wallingford replied: "He 
preaches the gospel, but does not keep a car- 
riage 1" 



MUTTON CHOP, 

113. To cook a mutton chop well is a 
great art. They should not be cut too thin, 
and should be done over a nice bright coal 
fire. They will take from eight to ten 
minutes. When the fat is transparent, and 
the lean feels hard, the chop is done. It 
should be served on a very hot plate, and 
with a nice mealy potato, hot. In dressing 
a chop never stick a fork into it. Tomato 
sauce is likewise served with it. 

BE always more ready to forgive than to return 
an injury. 



136 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

MUTTON CHOPS WITH LEMON. 

114. Wash the chops, wipe them dry, 
grease the bars of your gridiron, and broil 
them over hot coals. When they are done, 
lay them on a dish and 'season them with 
pepper and salt, and baste them with but- 
ter; peel and slice lemons, lay a slice on 
each chop, and send them to the table. 
This is the French method of serving them. 

MEMORY is not so brilliant as hope, but it is more 
beautiful, and a thousand times as true. 



IRISH STEW. 

115. About two pounds of the best end 
of a neck of mutton cut into neat chops ; 
season with three saltspoonsful of black 
pepper, and the same of salt ; slice thin 
three onions, put them in a stew-pan; 
place the mutton closely over; pour in 
just sufficient cold water to reach, but 
not quite cover the mutton. Let it boil up. 



THE YOUXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 137 

J 

Skim and simmer very gently for an hour 
and a quarter. Peel two pounds of mealy 
potatoes (all the same size), wash them, and 
place them on the mutton. Simmer half 
an hour longer, and serve on a very 
hot dish. 

AN IRISHMAN'S PLEA. "Are you. guilty or not 
guilty?" asked the clerk of arraigns to a prisoner

CUKEIED BOILED MUTTON, 

116. Cut into neat slices three quarters 
of a pound of cold boiled mutton. Sprinkle 
over it a teaspoonful of salt, two dessert- 
spoonsful of curry powder, and a table- 
spoonful of flour ; chop one onion quite fine 
and add that. Put the mutton into a stew- 
pan with half a pint of gravy if you have 
it, and if not, water. Shake the pan fre- 
quently, and let it simmer very gently for 
an hour and a half. Wash half a pound 
of rice, and boil it in a quart of water for

twenty-five minutes, drain it on a sieve, and 
put it into the oven for five minutes to dry. 
Place the rice round the dish neatly, and 
put the curry in the centre. Serve very 
hot, and with it a glass of mixed pickles, 
separate.

man always successful ; yet never had a fool a 
thorough enjoyment, never was a wise man wholly 
unhappy. 



A VERY NICE DISH OF COLD LAMB AND 
CUCUMBERS, OR SPINACH. 

117. Fry slices or chops of cold lamb 
till they are slightly browned ; dip the 
slices in bread crumbs, chopped parsley, 
and yolk of egg. Some grated lemon and 
a little nutmeg may be added. Fry them, 
and pour a little good gravy over them 
when served. The various methods of 
redressing mutton are applicable generally 
to lamb. 

A LADY who made pretensions to refined feelings, 
went to her butcher to remonstrate with him on

his cruel practices. " How," said she, " can you be 
so barbalous as to put innocent little lambs to 
death?" "Why not, madam?" said the butcher, 
"you wouldn't eat 'em alive, would you?" 



A NICE HASH OF MUTTON. 

118. Add to some cold gravy some 
finely-chopped onion and half a pint mush 
rooms. Boil the whole gently with some 
cold mutton cut in small pieces. Thicken 
the gravy with a little flour and butter. 

FOOTE, dining at the house of Mrs. Thrale, found 
nothing to his liking, and sat in expectation of 
something better. A neck of mutton beino- the last

the servant was taking it away, however, under- 
standing that there was nothing more, Foote called 
out to him, " Hello, John ! bring that back again

TO DRESS COLD MUTTON OR VEAL. 

119. If any of the neck of mutton or 
veal should be left after having been made 
into soup, it may, when cold, be cut into

small pieces and seasoned highly with 
Cayenne pepper, salt, and whole grains of 
allspice. Put all in a stew-pan with a little 
vinegar, and as soon as it is boiling hot 
serve it. 

WARBURTOX, in his account of his voyage up the 
Nile, gives an amusing instance of a singular opinion

red b}- them to young mutton because it stood more 
chewing !" 



MUTTON HASHED IN THE STYLE OF 

VENISON. 

120. Take three pints of mutton gravy, 
put it into a saucepan, and let it boil. 
Then add some Cayenne pepper and salt, 
some flour to thicken, and a little bit of 
butter. Cut the mutton into slices and put 
it in, and let it simmer for four or live 
minutes. Then add a gill of port wine. 
Don't let it boil, or the meat will become

made dish. The head and the feet are 
especially valuable for their nourishing 
qualities. 

IF you would relish your food, labor for it. If 
you would enjoy your raiment, pay for it before you 
wear it. If you would sleep souudly, take a clear 
conscience to bed with you. 



METHOD OF RE-DRESSING COLD ROAST 
BEEF, MUTTON, OR LAMB. 

122. Cut the meat into small thin 
slices, season well with pepper and salt, 
and dip each lightly in beaten egg and then 
in bread crumbs. Fry them a nice brown. 

A GENTLEMAN who greatly disliked the custom 
of giving fees to servants, provided himself with 
some farthings, and, on leaving the next party he 
attended, presented one to the footman as he stood 
at the door. " I beg your pardon, sir," said Johnny, 
"but you have made a mistake." "Oh, no," said 
the gentleman, "I never give less!"

A VERY NICE DISH OF MUTTON AND 
MASHED POTATOES. 

123. Cut the meat in small pieces, and 
stew in a little gravy, to which add a 
dessert-spoonful of mushroom or walnut 
catsup. Stew till hot. Thicken with a 
little flour and butter mixed, and serve 
on a dish surrounded by mashed potatoes. 

An inexpensive gravy for all stews, 
hashes, etc., may be made of a large onion, 
some whole pepper, a piece of bread toasted 
brown, but not burned, and a dessert-spoon- 
ful of walnut catsup boiled in a pint of 
water. 

" HAS that cookery book any pictures V said 
Miss C. to a bookseller. " No, madam, none," was 
the answer. " Why," exclaimed the witty and beau- 
tiful lady, " what is the use of telling us how to 
make a good dinner if they give us no plates ?" 



COLD MUTTON RE-COOKED WITH WINE. 

124. Take the remains of a leg of 
boiled or roast mutton, stick into it eight

or ten cloves, and season well with pepper 
and salt. Put it into a stew-pan with two 
carrots, two turnips, two onions, some 
parsley chopped fine, and some pieces of 
celery top. Cover it with cold water, and 
simmer it till the vegetables are perfectly 
tender. Take out the meat, skim off all 
the fat from the gravy, thicken it with 
some pieces of butter rolled in flour, and 
let it boil a minute or two. Just before it 
is taken from the fire pour in a glass of 
Madeira wine. Pour the gravy over the 
meat and serve. 

MASTER OF THE HOUSE. Oh, Maiy. what is there 
for dinner to-day ? 

MARY. I think, sir, it's cold meat, sir. 

MASTER OP THE HOUSE. U'ra ! Tell your mistress, 
Mary, when she comes in, that I may possibly be 
detained in the city on business, and she is on no 
account to wait dinner for me. 



VERY NICE SAUSAGE BALLS FROM COLD 

MUTTON. 

125. Take the most underdone parts 
of a boiled leg of mutton, chop it very fine, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 145 

and season with pepper, salt, and spice. 
Add six ounces of beef suet chopped fine, 
some pounded sweet herbs, a quarter of a 
pound of grated bread, the yolks and 
whites of two eggs well beaten, and a 
clove of garlic. Mix well, and press down 
into a pot. Use as sausages, or roll into 
balls, and fry a nice brown. 

A LADY meeting a girl who had lately left her 
service, inquired " Well, Lucy, where do you live 
now?" "Please, ma'am, I don't live now, Pm 
married! 1 ' replied the girl. 



MUTTON PIE WITH POTATO CRUST. 

126. Boil some potatoes, mash them 
with some milk and butter, and season with 
pepper and salt. Line a deep dish with the 
mashed potatoes. Have ready some small 
pieces of cold mutton or lamb; season the 
meat with pepper and salt, and fill the dish 
with the meat, and on the top lay some 
lumps of butter. Cover it with a lid of 
mashed potatoes, put it into a moderate

146 THE YOUXG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

oven, and bake it until the potatoes are a 
line brown. Serve it in the dish it was 
baked in. 



BOILED LEG OF LAMB. 

127. Trim off all the loose fat, cut off 
the shank, wash and wipe it dry ; dredge it 
with flour and tie it in a clean cloth ; put it 
in boiling water enough to cover it. The 
water should be salted in the proportion of 
two teaspoonsful of salt to a quart of water. 
Let it boil from two to three hours accord- 
ing to its size. Serve it with drawn butter 
or rich parsley sauce, whichever may be 
preferred, and vegetables of any kind which 
may be in season. 

LEAF IMPRESSIONS. To take perfect impressions 
of the leaves of plants, the following process should 
be adopted : Hold oiled paper in the smoke of a 
lamp, or of pitch, until it becomes coated with the 
smoke : to this paper apply the leaf of which you 
wish the impression taken, having previously warmed 
it between your hands, to render it pliable. Place 
the lower surface of the leaf upon the blackened 
surface of the oiled paper, in order that the nuineiv 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 147 

ous veins which are so prominent on this side may 
receive from the paper a portion of the smoke. Lay 
a paper over the leaf, and then press it gently upon 
the smoked paper, either with the fingers or, better 
still, with a small roller, covered with woollen cloth, 
or some soft material, so that every part of the leaf 
may come in contact with the soap on the oiled 
paper : a coating of smoke will thus adhere to the 
leaf. Then remove the leaf carefully, and place the 
blackened surface on a sheet of clean white paper, 
covering the leaf with a clean slip of paper, and 
pressing upon it with the fingers on the roller as be- 
fore. Thus may be obtained the impression of a 
leaf, showing its perfect outlines and veins, more 
accurately than in the most careful drawing; 



CUTLETS OF COLD ROAST LAMB OR MUTTON. 

128. Slice the cold meat of an under- 
done joint of lamb or mutton ; dip them into 
egg and well-seasoned bread crumbs, and 
broil or fry them over a quick fire, that they 
may be browned and heated through, with- 
out being overdone. 

A GENTLEMAN, at an eating-house asked the per- 
son next to him if he would please to pass the mus- 
tard ? "Sir," said the man, "do you mistake me 
for a waiter ?" " Oh, no," was the reply, " I mistook 
you for a gentleman." 



148 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

COLD MUTTON MINCED. 

129. Mince some cold mutton very 
finely, season it with pepper and salt, and 
put it in a pan with a little of the gravy, or 
with a small piece of butter. Heat it up, 
and serve it with fried tomatoes, or with 

poached eggs. 

FORMERLY, women were prohibited from marry- 
ing till they had spun a regular set of bed furniture, 
and, till their marriages, were consequently called 
spinsters, which term continues to this day in all 
legal proceedings. 



LAMB STEWED WITH ONIONS. 

130. This is a French dish. Peel some 
onions, cut them in slices, and put them in 
your stew-pan ; cut off the ends of the chops, 
pound them, and lay them in with the 
onions and some pepper and salt. Put in 
as much water as will cook them ; let them 
stew slowly till they are tender, then add 
a piece of butter rolled in flour to thicken 
the gravy. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 149 

A TECHNICAL DISTINCTION. When the Earl of 

B was brought before Lord Loughborough, to 

be examined upon application for a statute of lunacy 
against him, the Chancellor asked him, " How many 
legs has a sheep?" "Does your Lordship mean," 

answered B , "a live sheep or a dead one?" 

"Is it not the same thing?" said the Chancellor. 

"No, my lord," said Lord B , "there is much 

difference ; a live sheep has four, a dead one but two : 
there are but two legs of mutton the others are 
shoulders." 



A NICE RAGOUT FROM COLD LAMB. 

131. Separate the lamb from the bones, 
and cut into convenient pieces ; lard with 
bacon fried of a light brown, and stew very 
lightly in mutton gravy, sufficient to cover 
it ; season with sweet herbs, pepper, salt, 
and spice. Strain off the gravy ; keeping 
the meat hot, and add to it some oysters ; 
half a glass of port wine ; a few mushrooms, 
and a bit of butter rolled in flour; the juice 
of half a lemon ; boil together for a few min- 
utes in the gravy, and pour the sauce over 
the lamb. Mutton may be served in the 
same way.

WHY is a cricket on the hearth like a soldier in 
the Crimea ? Because he always advances under a 
brisk fire. 



BREAST OF VEAL STEWED WHITE. 

132. Cut a piece off each end ; make a 
forcemeat as follows : Boil the sweetbread, 
cut it very small, some grated bread, a 
little beef suet, two eggs, a little milk, some 
nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix it well 
together, and stuff the thin part of the 
breast with some of it the rest make up 
into little balls and fry. Skewer the skin 
close down, flour, and boil it in a cloth in 
milk and water. Make some gravy of the 
ends that were cut off, with half a pint of 
oysters, the juice of a lemon, and a piece 
of butter rolled in flour. When the veal is 
done, put it in the dish, garnish it with the 
balls, and pour the sauce over it. 

THY father hath watched for thy welfare, he hath 
toiled for thy ease. Do honor, therefore, to his age, 
and let not his gray hairs be treated with irreverence.

A BUEAST OF VEAL IN HODGE-PODGE. 

133. Gut the brisket of a breast of 
veal into little pieces, and every bone 
asunder ; then flour it, and put half a 
pound of butter into a stew-pan. When it 
is hot throw it into the veal, fry it all over 
a light brown, and then have ready a tea- 
kettle of boiling water; pour it into the 
stew-pan, fill it up, and stir it round. 
Throw in a pint of green peas, a whole 
lettuce washed clean, two or three blades 
of mace, a little whole pepper tied in a 
muslin rag, a little bundle of sweet herbs, 
a small onion stuck with a few cloves, and 
a little salt. Cover it close and let it stew 
an hour, or till it be boiled to your palate, 
if you would have soup made of it ; but if 
you would have only sauce to eat with the 
veal, you must stew it till there is just as 
much as you would have for sauce, and 
season it with salt to your palate. Take 
out the onion, sweet herbs and spice, and 



152 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

pour it altogether into your dish. If you 
have no peas, pare three or four cucumbers, 
scoop out the pulp, and cut thin pieces ; 
then take four or five heads of celery 
washed clean, and cut the white part 
small. When you have no lettuces, take 
the little hearts of savoys, or the little 
young sprouts. If you would make a very 
fine dish of it, fill the inside of your lettuce 
with forcemeat, and tie the top close with a 
thread, and stew it till there be just enough 
for the sauce. Set the lettuce in the middle 
and the veal round. Pour the sauce all 
over it. Garnish your dish with rasped 
bread made into figures with your fingers. 



ROAST VEAL. 

34. Season a breast of veal with 
pepper and salt; skewer the sweetbread 
firmly in its place, flour the meat, and 
roast it slowly before a moderate fire for 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 153 

about four hours. It should be of a fine 
Drown, but not dry. Baste it with butter. 
When done, put the gravy in a stew-pan, 
add a piece of butter rolled in browned 
flour, and if there should not be quite 
enough gravy add a little more water, with 
pepper and salt to the taste. The gravy 
should be brown. 

SINCE the days that are past are gone forever, and 
those that are to come may not come to thee, it 
behoveth thee, man, to employ the present time, 
without regretting the loss of that which is past, 
or too much depending on that which is to come. 



BAKED FILLET OF VEAL, 

135. Make incisions all around the 
bone, as closely as possible so as not to 
touch each other. Make a dressing of 
bread crumbs, an onion finely chopped, a 
little sweet marjoram, pepper and salt to 
the taste, with enough butter to cause the 
bread crumbs to adhere together. Fill 
these incisions with the dressing, season the 



154 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

meat with pepper and salt, and skewer the 
strip of fat around it. Pour in enough 
water to cover the bottom of the pan, put 
in the rack, and place the meat on it. As 
the gravy stews away add a little more 
water. Put it in a cool oven and let it cook 
three or four hours. When done, make the 
gravy with some flour rolled in butter, and 
add pepper and salt to the taste. 

HE that watches for an opportunity of revenge, 
lieth in wait against himself, and draweth down 
mischief on his own head. 



FRIED VEAL WITH TOMATOES. 

136. Cut some veal in thin slices, 
season it, and fry it of a nice brown. 
Have ready some tomatoes which have 
been stewed very dry, pass them through a 
sieve to take out the seeds, then put them 
into the pan in which the meat has been 
fried, and add butter enough to make a rich 
gravy. Pour them hot over the veal and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 155 

serve it. Beef is excellent, cooked in the 
same way. 

To be satisfied with a little is the greatest 
wisdom, and he that increaseth his riches increas- 
eth his cares; but a contented mind is a hidden 
treasure, and trouble findeth it not. 



FILLET OF VEAL A-LA-MODE, 

137. Cut deep incisions in the meat 
about an inch apart, and season it with 
pepper and salt. Make your dressing with 
a four-cent baker's loaf, two small onions 
finely chopped, and an ounce of butter, 
with pepper and salt to the taste. Fill the 
incisions with this dressing, put the veal in 
a pot with three gills of water, and cover it 
tightly. Let it cook slowly two hours at 
least. Some prefer a little sweet marjoram 
or thyme, finely powdered, added to the 
dressing. Take out the veal when it is 
done, and thicken the gravy with a little 
flour. 



156 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

SPICED VEAL. 

138. Cut some of the thick part of a 
cold loin of veal into pieces about an inch 
square. Pour over it as much spiced vine- 
gar as will cover it. It may be eaten hot or 
cold. To spice the vinegar : To two gills 
of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of Cayenne 
pepper, a little salt, a teaspoonful of ground 
allspice, two cloves, and a sprig of mace. 
Boil the spices in the vinegar and pour over 
the veal boiling hot. Cold beef will answer 
instead of veal. 

A TRAITOR'S REWARD. Graveston, who betrayed 
the Spaniards at Bergen-op-Zoom to Queen Eliza- 
beth, afterwards came to England to give her majesty 
an account of his success and to claim his reward. 
The queen gave him a thousand crowns, but said at 
the same time, " Get you home, that I may know 
where to send when I want a thorough paced villian." 



VEAL POT PIE. 

139. Cut up some veal, the best part of 
the neck is preferable to any other, wash 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 157 

and season it with pepper and salt ; line the 
sides of your pot with paste, put in the veal 
with some pieces of paste rolled out and cut 
in squares, cut up some pieces of butter 
rolled in flour and add to it, pour in as much 
water as will cover it, and lay a sheet of 
paste on the top, leaving an opening in the 
centre; put the lid on the pot and put it 
over a moderate fire, let it cook slowly till 
the meat is done ; place the soft crust on a 
dish, then put the meat over it, and on the 
top lay the hard crust, with the brown side 
up. Serve the gravy in a boat. To have 
the crust of a pot pie brown, set the pot on 
a few coals before the fire, and turn it fre- 
quently. 

THE WISE MAN cultivates his mind with know- 
ledge, the improvement of arts is his delight, and 
their utility to the public crowneth him with honor. 



SCOTCH KIDNEY-COLLOPS. 

140. Let the kidney be very fresh ; cut 
it in pieces the size of very small steaks; 



158 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK HOOK. 

soak the slices in warm water, and dry 
them well. Dust them with flour, and 
brown them in a stew-pan with fresh 
butter. When browned, pour a little hot 
water into the pan, four young onions 
minced, with salt, pepper, Cayenne, shred 
parsley, and a little vinegar, or onion-pickle 
vinegar. Cover the stew-pan close, and let 
the collops simmer slowly for two hours or 
more. 

ROSSINI had accepted an invitation to dine with 
a certain lady whose dinners were known to be 
arranged on a severely economical scale. The din- 

O ' 

ner offered to the maestro formed no exception to 
the general rule, and he left the table rather hungry. 
" I hope you will soon do me the honor to dine 
with me again," said the lady. " Oh, yes, immedi- 
ately, if you like," was the repty. 



MINCED VEAL. 

141. This is one of the most agreeable, 
simple, inexpensive and wholesome of made 
dishes. The meat from any joint of - veal is 
available, and every part may be used, some 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 159 

people not even objecting to a little fat. It 
must all be cut away from the bones and 
nicely minced. The brown outside, the 
gristles, and the bones (broken up), must 
be boiled into a gravy, with a little salt, 
pepper, and a blade of mace ; then strained 
off, and with the minced meat put into a 
stewpan with a teaspoonful of grated lemon- 
peel, the same quantity of lemon-juice, a 
tablespoonful of cream, and a piece of butter 
blended with flour. As soon as perfectly 
hot through, the mince should be poured 
out upon the dish, lined with toast. 



FRENCH STEW OF VEAL. 

142. Boil a knuckle of veal in just 
enough water to cover it, with a little salt. 
When the veal is tender, pour off the water 
it was boiled in and save it. Cut the veal 
in small pieces, and put it in a pan with 
the water it was boiled in. Add to this two 



169 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

hard-boiled eggs chopped very fine, a table- 
spoonful of allspice in grains (which should 
be crushed, but not broken fine), a quarter 
of a pound of butter, a little mace, and 
pepper and salt to the taste. Stir two 
tablespoonsful of flour smoothly in a little 
water, and pour into it. Set it over the 
fire, let it boil for two or three minutes, 
pour in two glasses of wine, and serve 
it hot. 

IN all thy desires let reason go along with thee, 
and fix not thy hopes beyond the bounds of proba- 
bility ; so shall success attend thy undertakings 
thy heart shall not be vexed with disappointments. 



CALF'S HEAD STEWED, WITH OYSTER 

SATJCE. - 

143. Soak half of a small calf's head 
(without the skin) for one hour in cold 
water, with a teacupful of vinegar in it. 
Well wash it in two or three waters ; put it 
into a stew-pan, with two onions, a bay leaf, 
a laurel leaf, a sprig of thyme, a sprig of 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 161 

marjoram, two sage leaves, four sprigs of 
parsley, two cloves, four allspice, six black 
peppercorns, half of a carrot, and a pint and 
a half of cold water. Boil up quickly ; 
skim ; then simmer gently for an hour and 
a half, skimming it constantly. Take out 
the head ; strain the liquor ; add to it three 
tablespoonsful of baked flour and the strained 
liquor of three dozen oysters ; boil up ; put 
the head in again, and continue longer ; 
add three dozen oysters, and then simmer 
for three-quarters of an hour and seven min- 
utes, and then serve. 

INTERVALS BETWEEN MEALS. As a general rule, 
an interval of five or six hours should elapse be- 
tween each meal, but this of course varies according 
to circumstances. Persons engaged in business fre- 
quently do themselves much mischief by disregard- 
ing these monitions amidst the bustle and excitement 

O 

of business. It is no unusual thing for a merchant 
to breakfast at eight o'clock in the morning, ride 
several miles, and return to dine at six or seven 
o'clock in the evening, without having eaten any 
thing all day. This is very injurious, and although 
it may not be immediately felt, it lays the train for 
subsequent dyspepsia and all its attendant horrors.

1G2 THE YOUXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

MOCK TURTLE, OF CALF'S HEAD, 

144. Take a fine large calf's head, split 
it open, and lay it for two or three hours in 
cold water ; then put it on to boil in as 
much water as will cover it. When it is 
done enough to take the meat off the bones, 
cut the meat into square pieces, and put 
them into a stewpan with some mace, cloves, 
nutmeg, red pepper, some sweet herbs, and 
a large onion ; salt it to your liking, put it 
in as much of the liquor as will cover it, and 
let it stew gently one hour. Then take one 
quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour, 
and some browned butter, mix it with the 
stew, and let it boil half an hour ; when 
done, add a glass of wine. Fry the liver 
and lay it round the dish with some nice 
forcemeat balls. 

Low MANTEL-PIECES. Low mantel-pieces are 
much less wholesome than high ones, because the 
under line of the worst air in the room is on a level 
with the fire-place ; the lower, therefore, this top is 
placed in a room, the deeper the upper portion of 
the body is immersed in the inferior air. In rooms 
not well ventilated, the heads of the occupiers are 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 163 

in the worst and the warmest air, their feet are 
placed in the best and coldest. A thermometer 
placed at different elevations in a warm room will 
confirm these truths. 



SWEET-BREAD FRIED. 

145. Cut sweet-breads into long slices, 
beat up the yolk of an egg, and rub it over 
them with a feather. Make a seasoning of 
pepper, salt, and grated bread; strew this 
over, and fry them in butter. Garnish with 
crisped parsley, and small thin slices of 
toasted bacon. 

A BROW-BEATING counsel asked a witness, during 
a trial for assault, the distance he was from the 
parties when the assault happened. He answered, 
"Just four feet five inches and a half." "How 
come you to be so exact, fellow ?" said the counsel. 
" Because I thought some fool or other would ask 
me, so I measured it." 



FRIED SWEET-BREADS. 

146. Parboil them in salt and water; 
when done, take them up and dry them in 



164 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

a cloth. With a sharp knife, cut them in 
half, season them with pepper and salt, flour 
them, and fry them in hot lard, of a light 
brown. Or they may be fried as oysters, 
with egg and bread crumbs, or grated 
crackers. 

EAT not to dulness ; drink not to elevation. 



BOILED SWEET-BREADS. 

14-7. First parboil them, then throw 
them into cold water to whiten and harden 
them. Wipe them dry and season them 
with pepper and salt, and broil them. They 
should be basted while broiling by putting 
them on a plate with a little melted butter 
in it. 

A CALF when fed for market is said to have con- 
sumed as much milk as would make one hundred 
pounds of cheese. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 165 

TO FRICASSEE SWEET-BREADS. 

148. Parboil the sweet-breads in salt 
and water, and when cool skim them, but 
be careful not to break them. Season with 
salt and pepper, dust some flour over them, 
and fry them a fine brown. Put them on a 
dish ; make a gravy by adding some water 
to the fat they were fried in, and a little 
brown flour. As soon as the gravy is thick- 
ened, pour in some Lisbon or Maderia wine, 
take it off the fire, pour it over the sweet- 
breads and serve hot. 

THE gifts of the understanding are the treasures 
of God ; and he appointeth to every one his portion 
in what measure seemeth good unto himself. 



ROASTED SWEET-BREADS. 

149. Sweet-breads should be parboiled, 
and then thrown into cold water, to make 
them white and firm. This is called Handl- 
ing, and should precede all the other modes 



166 THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 

of cooking them. Have ready some cracker 

/ 

crumbs well seasoned with pepper and salt, 
season your sweet-breads, dip each one into 
some beaten egg, then into the bread 
crumbs. Put them in a pan and bake or 
roast them. 

IT is better to be laughed at than ruined ; better 
to have a wife who cheapens every thing and buys 
nothing, than to be impoverished by one whose 
vanity would purchase every thing, but whose pride 
will cheapen nothing. 



SWEETBREAD PIE. 

150. Season the sweetbreads with pep- 
per and salt, dust some flour over them, 
and add enough water to stew them with a 
nice gravy. When done, butter a pie dish, 
line it with paste, put in the sweetbreads 
and some of the gravy, cover the pie with 
a lid of paste, leaving an opening in the 
centre. Bake it in a tolerably hot oven. 
When the crust is brown, serve the pie 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 107 

with the remainder of the gravy in a sauce 
tureen. 

LORD BYRON knew a dull man who lived on a 
bon mot of Moore's for a week ; and his lordship 
once offered a wager of a considerable sum that the 
reciter was guiltless of understanding its point, but 
he could get no one to accept the bet. 



STEWED SWEETBREADS. 

151. Parboil three or four sweetbreads 
in salt and water. When cool, skin them 
and cut them in half. Season them with 
pepper and salt, flour them, and fry them a 
light brown ; then stew them in a portion 
of the liquor in which they were boiled. 
Brown a piece of butter with flour ; add it, 
with a little pepper, salt, and a glass of 
white wine. 

A FORMAL, fashionable visitor thus addressed a 
little girl : " How are you, my dear ?" " Very 
well, l^thank you," she replied. The visitor then 
added : " Now, my dear, you should ask me how I 
am." The child simply and honestly replied, "I 
don't want to know 1" 



168 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

SWEETBREAD CUTLETS. 

152. Boil the sweetbreads for half an 
hour in water with a little salt, and when 
they are perfectly cold, cut them into slices 
of equal thickness, brush them with yolk 
of egg, and dip them into very fine bread 
crumbs seasoned with salt, Cayenne, and 
grated lemon-rind. Fry them of a fine 
light brown. Arrange them in a dish, 
placing them high in the centre, and pour 
under them a gravy made in the pan, 
thickened with a little flour, to which a 
glass of sherry or Madeira may be added 
just before it is taken off the fire. When 
it can be done conveniently, take as many 
slices of a cold boiled tongue as there are 
sweetbread cutlets, pare the skin from them, 
trim them into good shape, and dress them 
with the sweetbreads after they have been 
egged and seasoned in the same way, and 
place each cutlet upon a slice of tongue 
when they are dished. For variety, sub-

CALVES' BRAINS FRIED, 

153. Wash the brains clean, parboil 
them, remove all the skin, and season with 
pepper and salt ; dust flour over them, 
or bread crumbs, and fry them a delicate 
brown. 

As the late Professor was one day walking 

near Aberdeen, he met a well-known individual of 
weak intellect. " Pray," said the Professor, "how 
long can a person live without brains ?" " I dinna 
ken," replied Jemmy, scratching his head, "how auld 
are ye yourself t" 



CALF'S LIVER BROILED,

blood, wash it clean, and parboil it ; then 
season it with pepper and salt. Grease the 
bars of the gridiron, put the liver over a 
clear fire, and broil it till the slices are 
brown on both sides. 

A GENTLEMAN was one day disputing with Mirza 
Mohammed Ibrahim about the excellence of his cook, 
of whose fame he was very jealous, and wound up 
with " He ought to know something of cookery, for 
he has been forty years before the fire." "Well," 
said the Mirza, " he may have been forty years before 
the fire, but he is raw yet /" 



PIE OF COLD ROAST VEAL. 

155. Cut the veal in small pieces, and 
season them with pepper and salt. Make a 
nice paste, line a deep pie dish, fill it half 
full of the meat, and on the top lay some 
oysters, with some lumps of butter. Cover 
the pie with the paste and bake it. 

LORD BRACO, an ancestor of the Earl of Fife, was 
remarkable for practicing that miserable rule, " Get 
all you can, and keep all you get." One day, walking 
down the avenue from his house, he saw a farthing 
lying at his feet, which he took up and carefully 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 171 

cleaned. A beggar passing at the same time, en- 
treated his lordship would give him the farthing, 
saying "it was not worth a nobleman's attention." 
" Fin' a farthing yoursel', puir body," replied his 
lordship, and carefully put the coin into his breeches 
pocket. 



PIE OF COLD VEAL AND HAM. 

156. Cut the meat from the bones. 
It should be in pieces about half an inch 
square. Season it with pepper and salt. 
Take the bones and pieces of fat, put them 
in a saucepan with enough water to cover 
them. Let them stew till the water is 
reduced to one half. Then remove the 
bones, thicken the gravy with some butter 
rolled in flour, and season it with pepper 
and salt to the taste. Line the bottom and 
sides of a pie dish with paste, put in a layer 
of veal, then a layer of cold ham sliced very 
thin and so on, a layer of ham and veal 
alternately, till the dish is full. On the top 
of each layer, strew some yolks of eggs 
chopped fine. A few oysters or button- 



172 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

mushrooms improve this pie. Cover the 
top with paste, leaving an opening in the 
centre. Pour in a little of the gravy, and 
bake the pie in a rather slow oven. Serve 
it in the dish it was baked in, with the 
remainder of the gravy in a sauce tureen. 

SOME men devote themselves so exclusively to 
their business as almost entirely to neglect their 
domestic and social relations. A gentleman of this 
class having failed, was asked what he intended to 

o * 

do. " I am going home to get acquainted with my 
wife and children!" said he. 



TO COOK COLD SLICES OF VEAL. 

157. Take a piece of veal that has been 
roasted (but not over done), cut it into thin 
slices ; take from it the skin and gristles ; 
put some butter over the fire with some 
chopped onions ; fry them a little, then 
shake some flour over them ; shake the pan 
round, and put in some veal stock gravy, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and some spice ; put 
them in the veal with the yolk of two eggs ;

beat up with milk, a grated nutmeg, some 
parsley shred small, some lemon-peel grated, 
and a little juice ; stir it one way till it is 
thick and smooth, and put it in the dish. 

IN a country news room, the following notice is 
written over the chimney : " Gentlemen learning to 
spell are requested to use yesterday's paper. 



POTATO SAUSAGE. 

158. Of cold veal, finely chopped, add 
the same quantity of cold mashed potatoes, 
and season with pepper and salt to the 
taste. Make it out in small cakes, flour 
them, and fry them a light brown. They 
may be fried in sausage gravy if you have 
any left. Cold potatoes left from dinner 
will answer for this dish 

" I AM sorry, Mr. Wilson, to see this field of pota- 
toes so diseased," said a sympathizing inspector. 
"Ah ! weel, it's a great pity," replied the farmer, 
" but there's one comfort Jack Tamson's is not a 
bit better /"

VEAL SAUSAGE. 

159. To cold veal, finely chopped, add 
the same quantity of cold mashed potatoes ; 
season with pepper and salt to the taste ; 
make it out in small cakes ; flour them, and 
fry them a light brown on both sides. If 
there is any sausage gravy left, it is very 
good to fry them in. Cold potatoes left from 
dinner may be used for this dish. Cold 
beef may be used instead of veal. 



A NICE RAGOUT OF COLD VEAL. 

160. Cut the cold meat into small, 
round cutlets, trimming off the rough parts, 
bones, etc. With the bones, trimmings, 
and an onion, make a little good gravy ; 
melt some butter in a frying pan, and flour 
and brown the slices of veal of a light brown ; 
take them up, strain the gravy into the pan, 
and thicken the same to a proper consis-

tence with butter rolled in flour. When 
smooth and well mixed, put in the cutlets, 
and let them simmer very slowly ; season to 
liking with pepper, mace, and catsup ; skim 
the sauce, and pour hot over the cutlets. 

SAID TOM, " Since I have been abroad, I have 
eaten so much veal that I am ashamed to look a calf 
in the face!" "I s'pose, sir, then," said a wag, 
" you continue to shave without a glass!" 



PIE OF COLD VEAL. 

161. Cut the veal in small pieces; 
season with pepper and salt ; make a paste 
of two pounds of flour and one of butter ; 
line the bottom and sides of a deep pie-dish ; 
put in the veal with some of the cold gravy 
which has been left ; cover the top with the 
paste, leaving an opening in the centre, 
which may be ornamented by leaves of 
paste ; set it in a quick oven, and as soon 
as the crust is brown, serve the pie.

BROILED CHICKENS. 

162. Split them down the back, wash 
them nicely and wipe them dry. Heat 
your gridiron, grease the bars, and put your 
chickens over clear coals. Broil them 
nicely ; be careful not to burn the legs and 
wings. When done, season them with pep- 
per, salt, and a large piece of butter. Send 
them to the table hot. Partridges, pheas- 
ants and pigeons are broiled in the same way. 

THERE is no error more fatal than imagining that 
pinching a youth in his pocket money will teach 
him frugality. On the contrary, it will occasion 
his running into extravagances with so much more 

o o 

eagerness when he comes to have money in his own 
hands ; as pinching him in his diet will make his 
appetite only the more rapacious. If you put into 
the hands of your child more money than is suita- 
ble to his age and discretion, you must expect to 
find that he has thrown it away upon what is not 
only idle, hut hurtful. A certain, small, regular 
income any child above six years of age ought to 
have. When he comes to be capable of keeping an 
account, he ought to be obliged to do it ; he will 
thereb}" acquire a habit of frugality, attention, and 
prudence, that will be of service to him through 
his whole life. On the contrary, to give a 3 7 oung 
person money to spend at will, without requiring 
any account of it, is leading, or rather forcing him, 
into extravagance and folly.

FRIED CHICKENS. 

163. Wash your chickens, cut them in 
pieces, season them with pepper and salt. 
Have in a pan some hot butter and lard 
mixed ; dust some flour over each piece, and 
fry them slowly till of a hright brown on 
both sides ; take them up, put a little water 
in the pan, add some butter rolled in flour 
to thicken the gravy, and more pepper and 
salt if required. Young spring chickens are 
only suitable for frying. 

A COUNTRYMAN was once sowinghis grass ground, 
when two smart fellows, riding that way, called to 
him with an insolent air, " Well, honest fellow," 
said one of them. " 'Tis your business to sow, but 
we reap the fruit of your labor." To which the 
countryman replied : 'Tis very likely you may, 
truly, for I am sowing hemp."

son with salt and pepper. Line the sides 
of the pot with paste, put in the pieces of 
chicken, and between every layer of chicken 
put in a piece of butter rolled in flour, with 
squares of the paste if you choose ; pour in 
enough cold water to cover it, and put on a 
lid of the paste, leave an opening in the cen- 
tre of the top crust, cover the pot, place it 
in front of the fire with a few coals under it. 
Turn the pot frequently that the crust may 
be evenly browned all around. When it is 
done, if the gravy should not be thick 
enough, add a little more flour mixed with 
butter. Dish it by putting the top crust on 
the sides of the dish, lay the chicken in the 
centre, and place the brown crust on the 
top. Serve the gravy in a sauce boat. 

BACON says justly, the best part of beauty is that 
which a picture cannot express.

COLD ROAST FOWLS FRIED. 

165. Beat the yolk of two eggs. Cut 
the fowls into pieces and dip them first in 
the egg, then in the crumbs. Fry the cut 
pieces in butter or nice lard. Grated cheese 
may be used to give a piquant flavor. The 
dish may be garnished with slices of fried 
potatoes. 

EDDIE, (a very smart boy) : " Pa, how many 
chickens are there on this dish?" PARENT: "two 
my son." EDDIE: "No, there are three. This is 
one, and this is two and one and two make three." 
PARENT : " Well, then, your mother may have one ; 
I'll take the other, and you shall have the third for 
your dinner." 



A DELICATE DISH FROM COLD FOWL OR VEAL. 

166. Stew a few small mushrooms in a 
bit of butter, a quarter of an hour; mince 
them very small, and add them, with the 
gravy, to minced veal or parts of fowl, with 
a little pepper and salt, some cream, and a 
bit of butter rubbed in a little flour. Sim-

PATTIES FROM COLD TURKEY OR CHICKENS. 

167. Mince the white part of the flesh, 
and mix it with a little grated ham. Stew 
this in a little good gravy, or melted butter. 
Put a spoonful of cream to the mince, and 
season with pepper, salt and mace. Patties 
may be made of cold lamb, veal, turkey, 
chickens, etc., and of lobster, oysters, etc. 
Patties may be either baked in their paste, 
without the intervention of a pan, having & 
piece of paper under each ; or they may be 
baked in tin or earthenware pans of various 
forms. Those baked in pans will generally 
be most approved because the paste will be 
more delicate; or the paste will be baked

FRICASSEE FROM COLD BOILED CHICKEN. 

168. Cut up the chicken and put it to 
simmer in a little gravy made of some of 
the water in which it was boiled, together 
with the neck, feet, liver, heart, and giz- 
zard, stewed well together. Season well 
with pepper and salt. Then take out the 
chicken, and keep it hot. Strain the gravy, 
put it back in the saucepan, with a little 
more salt and pepper if necessary, a little 
grated nutmeg, and a bit of butter roiled in 
flour. Give it a boil, then add a little 
cream, and stir it over the fire, but do not 
let it boil again. Pour this gravy over the 
chicken, and serve hot. Some nicely fried

" I REGARD the discovery of a new dish," said a 
gourmand, "as a far more interesting event than the 
discovery of a new star for we always have stars 
enough, but can never have too many cooks. I 
shall never consider the science sufficiently honored 
until we have a cook elected to Congress." 



BROILED COLD CHICKEN. 

169. Split the chicken down the back, 
have an egg beaten, dip the chicken into it, 
and then into some nicely-seasoned bread 
crumbs. Broil over a clear gentle fire. 
The neck, feet, and gizzard, may be boiled 
down to make a gravy; and the liver, after 
having simmered five or ten minutes, may 
be taken out, mashed, and used to thicken 
the gravy. Serve hot.

VERY NICE SCALLOPS FROM COLD CHICKEN. 

170. Bone the meat, and mince it 
small ; set it over the fire in a little cream, 
and season with nutmeg, pepper, and salt ; 
then put it into scallop shells, and fill with 
crumbs of bread, over which put some bits 
of butter, and brown them. 

WHY is the first chicken of a brood like the

trimmings and bones in a saucepan with 
some pepper, salt, a slice of lean ham, and 
a little onion. Simmer this for half an 
hour, thicken it with a bit of butter rolled 
in flour, then put in the meat. Before 
serving, squeeze in a little lemon juice.

A POOR emaciated -Irishman, having called in a

that's a dale of mustard for so little mate /" 



RAGOUT OF LIVERS OF POULTRY, GAME, Etc. 

173. Soak the livers in water and clean 
them, put them into a saucepan with gravy, 
pickled mushrooms, or a little catsup, and 
a bit of butter rolled in flour. Season with 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 185 

pepper and salt. Stew for ten or twelve 
minutes. The liver of a turkey may be 
broiled and set in the centre of the dish, 
with the other livers around. 

SIDNEY SMITH was once dining; with a French 

O 

gentleman, who had been before dinner indulging 
in a variety of free-thinking speculations, and had 
ended by avowing himself a materialist. " Very 
good soup this," said Mr. Smith. " Oui, Monsieur, 
c'est excellente," was the reply. " Pray, sir, do you 
believe in a cook ?" inquired Mr. Smith. 



TO ROAST A TURKEY WITH OYSTERS. 

174. When it is trussed for roasting, 
cut the liver to pieces and set it over the 
fire in a stew-pan, with half a pint of 
oysters washed, and their liquor, which 
must be strained, some pepper and salt, 
two bay leaves, two blades of mace, a piece 
of butter rolled in flour. Let these stew 
very gently about ten minutes, and then 
take them off. Singe the turkey and stuff 
it with oysters, cover the paper over it, spit

it, and lay it down to a good fire, but at a 
distance. While it is roasting set on a 
stew-pan with half a pint of essence of 
ham; take a pint of oysters, throw them 
into boiling water; take off the beards, 
then put them into the essence of ham ; 
add a little lemon juice, give them a boil. 
When the turkey is done and in the dish, 
pour the sauce over it. 

To BE continually judging and censuring those 
that were never privately and personally reproved, 
lovingly and compassionately admonished, nor once 
earnestly and heartily prayed for by them this 
censorious spirit is a Christless spirit. 



TURKEY HASHED. 

175. Mix some flour with a piece of 
butter, stir it into some cream and a little 
veal gravy till it boils up. Cut the turkey 
in pieces, not too small, put it into the 
sauce, with grated lemon peel, white pepper, 
and mace (pounded) ; a little mushroom 
powder or catsup. Simmer it up. Oysters 
may be added.

FOWLS seem exceedingly grateful for the gift 
of cold water. They never swallow a drop of it 
without turning up their eyes to heaven. 



ROAST DUCK. 

176. Clean and prepare them as other 
poultry. Crumb the inside of a small loaf 
of baker's bread, to which add three ounces 
of butter, one large onion chopped fine, 
with pepper and salt to taste. Mix all 
well together. Season the ducks both in- 
side and out with pepper and salt. Then 
fill them with the dressing, and skewer 
tightly. Place them on the pan, back 
upward ; dredge a little flour over, with 
water sufficient to make gravy. When a 
nice brown, turn them over. Baste fre- 
quently ; and when done, send to the table 
hot, and eat with cranberry sauce. 

DR. FRANKLIN was once endeavoring to kill a 
turkey by electricity, when he received the whole 
force of the battery himself. Recovering, he good- 
humoredly remarked, that instead of a turkey, he 
had nearly put an end to a goose. 



188 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

177. Clean your goose, wash it, and 
wipe it dry, then season it with pepper and 
salt, both inside and out. Make a dressing 
of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, butter, a lit- 
tle sweet marjoram and some onions finely 
minced. Fill the goose with this dressing, 
truss it firmly, and put it on the spit. 
Whilst it is roasting, baste it wdth butter, 
and be careful not to let it burn. Clean the 
giblets, put them on in a stew-pan, with very 
little water, some salt and pepper, and boil 
them. Add the liquor they were boiled in 
to the gravy which dripped from the goose. 
Thicken it with some butter rolled in flour, 
let it boil a few yninutes ; add more pepper 
and salt, if necessary. Pour this gravy in 
the boat, and serve it with the goose. Some 
prefer a little sage added to the dressing in 
place of the sweet marjoram. A very good 
dressing for roast goose is to substitute pota- 
toes boiled and finely mashed instead of the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 189 

bread crumbs, then add the pepper, salt, 
onions and sweet marjoram as before. 

AN awkward man attempting to carve a goose, 
dropped it on the floor. " There now !" exclaimed 
the wife, "we've lost our dinner." "Oh no, my 
dear !" answered he, "it's safe. I have got my foot 
on it!" 



COLD DUCKS STEWED WITH RED CABBAGE. 

178. Cut cold ducks into convenient 
pieces, and warm them very gradually in 
some of their gravy. Shred some red cab- 
bage very fine, wash it, and drain it on a 
sieve ; put it to stew with some butter, and 
a little pepper and salt, in a stew-pan closely 
covered, shaking it frequently. If it should 
get too dry, add a spoonful or two of the 
gravy. When well done arid tender, add a 
small glass of wine or vinegar; lay it on a 
dish ; place the pieces of duck upon it, and 
serve. 

A MAN whose first wife was remarkably neat 
married a slattern. On one occasion she mustered 
resolution to rub down the old mahogany table. 



190 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

Her good man sat quietly regarding her until she 
had done, when he burst into tears. She desired 
to know what had affected him in so unusual a 
manner? " The sight of that table," said he ; " for 
I now recognize it as an old acquaintance, and it 
awakens reminiscences of days that are gone, for it 
always looked thus when my first wife was living." 
It is unneccessary to say that the insulted lady 
bounced out of the room and declared as she 
slammed the door behind her, that she would make 
herself a slave to no man. 



COLD DUCK STEWED WITH PEAS. 

179. Put a pint of the cold duck gravy 
and a pint of green peas together in a stew- 
pan, and let them stew until the peas are 
soft ; then add a glass of red wine, or this 
may be omitted. Add some onion chopped 
small, or garlic, if liked, and a little more 
gravy, to make up the loss by stewing. 
Season with lemon peel, Cayenne pepper 
and salt. Put in the duck, and warm 
gently, under a close cover. Add a little 
walnut catsup, and serve hot. 

DR. MARSH says, the best cure for the hysterics 
is to discharge the servant girl. In his opinion 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 191 

there is nothing like work to keep the nervous sys- 
tem from becoming unstrung. Some women think 

o o 

they want a physician, when they need a scrubbing- 
brush. 



HASHED COLD DUCK. 

180. Cut the duck in pieces, season 
with pepper and salt. Slice some cold ham 
very thin. Lay the duck and ham in a 
stew-pan, put some pieces of butter rolled in 
flour, with enough water to keep it from 
burning. As soon as it cornes to the boil 
add a glass of Madeira wine, and serve it 
with green peas boiled and buttered. The 
hash should not boil after the wine is poured 
in, but be taken off the fire immediately. 



GIBLET PIE. 

181. Clean the giblets, cut the legs in 
two, the wings and neck into three, and the 
gizzard into four pieces, season them highly 
with pepper and salt, pour a little water on 



192 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

them and stew them till tender. Then 
take out the giblets, and when they are cool 
put them in a deep dish with a little of the 
liquor they were stewed in, cover with paste, 
and bake in a moderate oven. In the mean 
time take the remainder of the liquor, skim 
it free from fat, put it over the fire in a 
clean stew-pan, wi-th more seasoning, if 
necessary, and thicken it with a little flour 
and butter. Serve this gravy in a sauce 
tureen with the pie. If you have any cold 
game or poultry it might be cut in pieces 
and included in the pie ; but the bones 
should be cracked and stewed with the 
giblets. 

A TRAVELLER was lately boasting of the luxury 
of arriving at night after a hard day's journey, to 
partake of the enjoyment of a well-cut ham, and the 
left leg of a goose. " Pray, sir, what is the peculiar 
luxury of a left leg ?" " Sir, to conceive its luxury, 
you must find that it is the only leg that is left!" 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 193 

GIBLET PIE-ANOTHER WAY. 

182. Take the tips of the wings, heart, 
liver, head, neck and gizzard of a goose, 
clean them well, boil them in enough salt 
and water to cover them. Take them out 
when tender, and to the water they were 
boiled in, add pepper and more salt if re- 
quired, and a little flour, and as soon as it 
boils remove it from the fire. Make a good 
paste ; cover the bottom and sides of a pie 
dish, put in the giblets, pour some of the 
gravy over them, cover the top with paste, 
leaving an opening in the centre to permit 
the escape of the steam, and bake it in a 
quick oven. Have the remainder of the 
gravy hot and serve in a tureen with the 
pie.

salt, and a little butter rolled in flour, cover 
them with water, stew them till they are 
very tender. Line the sides of your pie 
dish with paste, put in the giblets, and if 
the gravy is not quite thick enough, add a 
little more butter rolled in flour. Let it boil 
once, pour in the gravy, put on the top 
crust, leaving an opening in the centre of it 
in the form of a square ; ornament this with 
leaves of the paste. Set the pie in the oven, 
and when the crust is done take it out. 

A GREEN one, who had a great desire to possess a 
goose alive, set off to a neighboring town, resolved 
to buy one, and fatten it for himself. Having made 
a bargain, he was returning home when he was met 
by a waggish friend, to whom he showed his pur- 
chase. " Why," said his friend to him, on seeing 
the goose. " They've given you no giblets with him ; 
you have been cheated." The smiling countenance 
of the Irishman was turned to dismay; he reflected 
for a moment, then turned back, and actuallj* walked 
a distance of two miles, to ask the market woman 
for the giblets of the live goose.

BROILED PIGEONS. 

184. Young pigeons or squabs are the 
nicest for broiling. Cut them down the 
back, clean them nicely, wash them and dry 
them on a clean napkin. Have ready a bed 
of clear coals, heat your gridiron, grease the 
bars to prevent the pigeons from sticking, 
and place them over the fire; turn them 
frequently, and be careful not to let the legs 
and wings burn. When they are done, put 
them on a dish, season them with pepper 
and salt, and baste them well with butter 
on both sides. 

ONE AND TWO ARE THREE. A young student 
came during the holidays from college to see his 
parents. Having one evening two pigeons for sup- 
per, he said to them, " I can prove by the rules of 
logic and arithmetic that those two pigeons are 
three." " Do so, my dear," said the father. There- 
upon he began. " This is one, and that is two, and 
one and two make three." The father replied, " As 
you have done it so nicely, your mother shall have

CROOTETTES OF COLD CHICKEN. 

186. Mince some cold chicken very fine 
with a little suet; season it with pepper, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 197 

salt, and some parsley chopped fine ; add a 
little grated nutmeg ; put part of the mix- 
ture into a marble mortar; pound it to a 
paste, and add occasionally a tablespoonful 
of well-beaten egg ; then pound more of the 
chicken in the same manner till all is done. 
Flour your hands, make the meat into rolls 
of an oblong shape, dip them into beaten 
ogg, and then into bread crumbs, and fry 
them a fine brown. 

ONE would never guess the device adopted by 
one of the London dandies of ripe age to delude his 
acquaintances into the supposition that his luxuri- 
ant wig is the natural product of his own head. 
The secret has been betrayed by a treacherous bar- 
ber. The gentleman, it seems, caused to be manu- 
factured as many wigs as there are days in the 
month, each wig being provided with a box and a 
number. Every morning he puts on a peruke 
slightly differing from the others. Thus, the hair 
of number four is a trifle longer than that of num- 
ber three, and so on to numbers thirty and thirty- 
one, which look as though they needed cutting. 
Upon reaching the last day of the month, our in- 
genious beau visits his club, runs his fingers through 
his wig, and says in a careless tone, "My hair is 
growing much too long ; I must have it cut I" And 
the next morning he dons number one again.

CROQUETTES OF FOWLS. 

187. Rub two ounces of fresh butter 
into six ounces of dried flour ; beat the yolks 
of two fresh eggs with four tablespoonfuls of 
cold water, and stir into the flour till in a 
stiff paste ; knead till quite smooth ; roll it 
out twice ; then let it stand in a cool place 
for five or six hours ; cut up about half a 
pound of cold fowl (roast or boiled) free 
from skin ; put the bones and trimmings 
into the sauce-pan, with a piece of garlic 
the size of a pea and half a pint of water, 
and stew for gravy ; pound the fowl to paste ; 
add two ounces of either ham, hung beef, or 
tongue, pounded ; season with the sixth part 
of a nutmeg, grated, half a saltspoonful of 
white pepper, the grated rind of the quarter 
of a lemon, half a saltspoonful of flour of 
mustard, and a quarter of a saltspoonful 
of salt; add sufficient gravy to moisten. 
Continue to pound till all the ingredients 
are well mixed ; roll out the paste the eighth

of an inch thick ; divide it into eight equal 
sized pieces, about three inches square; 
brush over the surface with cold water ; put 
an eighth part of the pounded meat into 
each piece, in the form of a sausage ; fold 
the paste over; press the edges to make 
them adhere ; then fry in plenty of boiling 
lard or clarified dripping (one pound) till of 
a yellow-brown color (about ten minutes) ; 
drain on a sieve before the fire, and serve 
on a neatly folded napkin, with or without 
fried parsley in the centre. 

LET thine own business engage thy attention ; 
leave the care of the State to the governors thereof. 



PARTRIDGES-STEWED, BROILED, OR 

ROASTED. 

188. When partridges are too old to 
roast, they may be stewed in the following 
manner. Cut them in quarters, season with 
pepper and salt, and put them in a stew- 
pan with nearly water enough to cover 



200 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

them. When tender, add some butter, 
mixed with flour, to thicken the gravy. 

Partridges are usually split down the 
back, washed, wiped dry, and seasoned 
with salt, and broiled. When done, dust 
pepper over them, and baste well with 
butter. They may also be roasted like 
chickens. 



A GENTLEMAN complimented a lady on her im- 
proved appearance. "You are guilty of flattery!" 
said she. "Not so," replied the gentleman, "for I 
vow you are as plump as a, partridge." "At first," 
said the lady, " I thought you guilty of flattery 
only ; but now I find you are actually making game 
of me !" 



ROASTED REED BIRDS, 

189. Pick your birds, and with a pair 
of scissors cut and draw them as chickens. 
Wash them clean, and wipe them dry. 
Make a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, 
salt; butter enough to make the crumbs 

/ o 

adhere together; chopped onion may be 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 201 

added, with a small quantity of any kind 
of sweet herb finely powdered. Fill the 
birds with this dressing, sew them up, put 
them on a spit, and baste them with butter 
whilst they are roasting. 

A CERTAIN barrister, who was remarkable for 
coming into court with dirty hands, observed that 
he " had been turning over Colce." " I should have 
thought it had been coal!" was the reply of a 
neighboring counsel. 



BABBIT A-LA-FRANCAISE. 

190. Cut the rabbit in pieces, and 
season it highly with salt and pepper, and 
a very little mace. Just cover it with 
water. When the meat is quite tender, 
mix some flour with a large piece of butter ; 
when the gravy is quite thick, add half a 
pint of port wine. Send it to the table 
very hot. 

AN Irish pedlar asked an itinerant poulterer the 
yrice of a pair of fowls. " Six shillings, sir. " ' In 
my country, my darling, you might buy them for

sixpence a-pace." "Why don't you remain in your 
own dear country, then ?" " 'Case we have no six- 

/ * 

pences, my jewel," said Pat. 



FRICASSEED RABBIT. 

191. Take a stew-pan with a tightly- 
fitting cover, cut up a couple of rabbits, 
season them well with Cayenne pepper, 
salt, and a sprig of mace. Add a large tea- 
cup of hot water, and stew them till they 
begin to be tender; then add tw<. ounces 
of butter, rolled in a little flour, to thicken 
the gravy. Just before taking it from the 
fire, pour in a glass of Madeira. Serve 
immediately. Cream may be added instead 
of the wine. 

A GAME-KEEPER, writing a letter to a friend, de- 
termined to send him some rabbits. "Tell me," 
said he to a companion, " how many b's there are in 
rabbits ?" " That depends upon circumstances," 
replied the rustic oracle; "how many rabbits are 
you sending?" "Four." "Then eight b's of 
course, two for each rabbit." The keeper there- 
fore wrote " I have the pleasure of sending you 
some rabbbbbbbbits !" 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 203 

WHITE FRICASSEE OF RABBIT. 
192. Cut the rabbit into joints, and 
soak it in cold water for two hours. Put 
into a stew-pan three or four slices of fat 
bacon, half a carrot, a large onion, half a 
clove of garlic, half a head of celery, a 
bunch of parsley, a bay leaf, a laurel leaf, 
and two sprigs of thyme, all cut up. Lay 
in the rabbit, and on that put three or four 
slices of bacon. Stand the stew-pan by the 
side of the fire for an hour. The rabbit 
should be firm and perfectly white. Make 
a sauce as follows : Half a pint of stock 
(No. 2), a saltspoonful of loaf sugar, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, the tenth part of a nut- 
meg grated, and a dessertspoonful of baked 
flour. Boil up. Put in the rabbit, and 
simmer for twenty minutes. Beat the 
yolks of two fresh eggs with a gill of 
good cream ; lay the rabbit neatly on a hot 
dish; pour the juice of a lemon over it; 
stir the cream and eggs into the sauce for 
two minutes ; pour it over the rabbit, and 



204 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

serve. The bacon may be rolled, browned 
before the fire, and used to garnish the dish. 

WE firmly believe that many a case of chronic 
ugliness might be cured through the means of 
healthy exercise. Get up, then, and shake off your 
sloth ; send that dead black blood through the 
channels of your body ; let it come up to your sal- 
low cheeks in red waves. Come to the resolution 
that you give your blood quicker circulation. Your 
hearts will be the sooner purified, and made meet 
for the joys, and strong for the trials of life. 



RABBIT POT PIE. 

193. Cut the rabbit in small pieces, sea- 
son it highly with salt and pepper. Make 
a paste, line the sides of a pot with the crust, 
then put in the rabbit, with three ounces of 
butter cut up and rolled in flour. Roll out 
some of the dough, cut it in pieces about 
three inches square, and lay it in with the 
pieces of rabbit; pour in as much water as 
will cover it, roll out a sheet of paste and 
place on the top, leaving an opening in the 
centre. Cover the pot with the lid, and let 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 205 

it cook slowly till the rabbit is done. If 
when your pie is nearly done, the gravy 
should not be thick enough, add a few more 
pieces of butter rolled in flour. When the 
pie is done put the top or soft crust at the 
bottom of the dish, lay the rabbit on it, then 
place the brown crust on the top with the 
brown side up. Serve the gravy in a gravy 
boat. 

A YOUNG woman meeting her former fellow-ser- 
vant, was asked how she liked her place. " Very 
well." "Then you have nothing to complain of?" 
" Nothing ; only master and missis talk such very 
bad grammar." 



SMOTHERED HABBIT. 

194. Clean the rabbit, wash it thorough- 
ly, season it well with salt and pepper, lay 
it flat on the gridiron, broil it slowly. It 
should be a fine brown when done. Have 
ready eight or ten large onions, boiled and 
mashed with a piece of butter, some pepper 
and salt. Baste the rabbit with butter, and 



206 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

pour the mashed onions over it, so as to 
cover it entirely. Serve it immediately. 

A MISER caught a fly, put it into the sugar basin, 
and set a plate over it. " What is that for ?" said 
a bystander. "Hush!" whispered the miser, "if 
the fly escapes, I shall know that some one has been 
at my sugar /" 



BEST WAY OF COOKING VENISON. 

195. Cut your venison in rather thin 
slices, pound them, lay them on a dish, and 
send them to the table. Have a chafing-dish 
on the table, lay some of the slices of venison 
in the pan of the chafing-dish, throw on a 
little salt, but not so much as for other meat, 
a lump of butter, and some currant jelly, 
put the cover on the dish, let it remain a 
minute or two, take off the cover, turn the 
slices of meat, place 4t on again, and in two 
or three minutes more the venison will be 
sufficiently cooked. Each person at the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 207 



table adds pepper to suit the taste. Some 
prefer venison cooked without currant jelly. 

RESOLVE to perform what you ought: perform 
without fail what you resolve. 



VENISON STEAKS. 

196. Cut your venison in slices, pound 
it, arid having heated your gridiron, grease 
the bars and place the meat on it. Broil 
the venison very quickly over clear coals, 
and as soon as it is done put it on a dish, 
season with pepper and salt and plenty of 
butter. Send it to the table immediately. 
Serve it with currant jelly. The plates 
should be warm. 

THERE is no objection to broils in a house, so they 
be confined to the kitchen. 



HASH OF COLD VENISON. 

197. Cut the meat from the bones ; 
crack the bones and put them into a sauce- 



208 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK I5OOK. 

pan with the trimmings, with barely enough 
water to cover them ; stew till the water is 
reduced one half; strain the liquid, and add 
some pieces of butter rolled in flour, and 
some currant jelly. As soon as it boils add 
the venison, which should be cut in small 
pieces. In five minutes it will be ready to 
serve. 

EVEN a pig upon a spit has one consolation ; 
things are sure to take a turn. 

WHEN Dr. Johnson was asked why he was not 
invited out to dine as Garrick was, he answered, as 
if it was a triumph to him, " Because great lords 
and ladies don't like to have their mouths stopped 1" 



A HASH OF COLD VENISON. 

198. Cut the cold venison into thin 
slices. Then make a gravy by stewing the 
bones and trimmings, which should be sea- 
soned with some whole grains of pepper and 
salt ; thicken it with a piece of butter rolled 
in flour. When hot add a glass of port wine 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 209 

and a small glass of currant jelly ; then put 
in the slices of venison and simmer them 
slowly for a few minutes. Serve with 
toasted bread around the dish. 

AT a venison feast Sir Joshua Reynolds addressed 
his conversation to one of the company who sat 
near him, but to his great surprise, could not get a 
single word in answer; until, at length, his silent 
neighbor turned to him and said, " Sir Joshua, 
whenever you are at a venison feast, I advise you 
not to speak during dinner-time. Through that 
last question of } T ours, I have unfortunately swal- 
lowed a piece of fine fat, without tasting the flavor /" 



A NICE PIE FROM COLD VENISON. 

199. Cut the venison into small squares 
and season it with grated numeg, pepper, 
and salt ; line the sides and edges of a dish 
with puff paste, lay in the meat, and add 
half a pint of rich gravy, made with the 
trimmings of the venison ; add a glass of 
port wine, and the juice of half a lemon; 
cover the dish with the paste and bake. 
Pour a little more gravy into the pie w T hen

AN old gentleman being asked what he liked for 
dinner replied : " A keen appetite, good company ', 
something to eat, and a clean napkin." 



A NICE STEW FROM COLD VENISON. 

200. Make a gravy from the fragments 
and bones, and add, if convenient, a little 
mutton gravy. Let this simmer ; then skim 
and add browned butter thickened with 
flour, some catchup, a little claret, if ap- 
proved, and a spoonful of currant jelly. 
Squeeze in a little lemon ; give a boil, and 
then while simmering add the pieces of veni- 
son thinly sliced. Garnish with cut pickles ; 
or with slices of lemon, and fried bread. 

OLD Mrs. Darnley is a pattern of household 
economy. She says she has made a pair of socks 
last fifteen years, by ^merely knitting new feet to 
them every winter, and new legs every other winter. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 211 

ROAST PIG. 

201. Prepare the pig by cutting off the 
feet, scraping and cleansing the head and 
ears, cutting out the tongue and eyes, and 
cleaning the throat. Wash it perfectly 
clean, and wipe it dry. Make a dressing 
of bread crumbs, some onions finely chop- 
ped, with salt, pepper, and sweet marjoram, 
to the taste ; also butter enough to make 
the crumbs adhere together. Any spice 
may be added, and the grating of a lemon, 
but many prefer the dressing without spice. 
Rub the pig thoroughly inside with salt, 
Cayenne pepper, and powdered sage; then 
fill it with the dressing and sew it up. Rub 
the outside with salt, Cayenne pepper, and 
sage, put it on the spit, and place it before 
a clear but not too hot a fire. Have a piece 
of clean sponge tied on a stick, dip it in 
melted butter, and as the skin dries moisten 
it. A common-sized pig takes from three 
to four hours to roast. An excellent filling 
may be made of potatoes boiled and mashed, 



212 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

instead of the bread. If potatoes are used, 
the dressing will require more butter. 

IT is said by those who know, that Lamb on 
Roast Pig is relished by every one. 



ROAST PORK. 

202. Take a nice middle piece of 
young pork, separate the joints, and crack 
the bones across the middle, but do not 
break the skin ; score it parallel with the 
ribs, wash it, put it on the spit, with a little 
water in the bottom of the roaster ; and to 
five pounds of pork rub in well two tea- 
spoonfuls and a half of salt, two teaspoon- 
fuls of sugar, and one of Cayenne pepper. 
Put no flour on it, or baste it while cooking, 
as it softens the skin and makes it tough. 
Pour the gravy into a pan, skim off a part 
of the fat, stir in a little flour mixed with 
cold water, add some water, and let it boil 
once then serve it in a gravy tureen. If 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 213 

it should not be sufficiently seasoned, add a 
little more pepper or salt as it may require. 
Apple sauce is always served with roast 
pork. 

"WHAT is ETERNITY?" The following beautiful 
answer, by a pupil of the deaf-and-dumb school at 
Paris, contains a sublimity of conception scarcely 
to be equalled: " The lifetime of the Almighty." 



PORK STEAKS. 

203. Cut the pork into slices, season 
with Cayenne pepper, salt, and pulverized 
sage. Fry them a fine brown on both sides. 
Place a form of cranberry sauce in the 
centre of the dish, and lay the slices of 
pork around it. Apple sauce may be 
preferred to the cranberry in which case 
it must be piled up in the centre of the 
dish. 



214 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

SCRAPPLE, No. 1. 

204. This is generally made of the 
head, feet, and any pieces which may be 
left after having made sausage meat. 
Scrape and wash well all the pieces de- 
signed for the scrapple, and put them in a 
pot with just as much water as will cover 
them. Add a little salt, and let them boil 
slowly till the flesh is perfectly soft and the 
bones loose. Take all the meat out of the 
pot, pick out the bones, cut it up fine, and 
return it to the liquor in the pot. Season 
it with pepper, salt, and rubbed sage, to 
the taste. Set the pot over the fire, and 
just before it begins to boil, stir in gradually 
as much Indian meal as will make it as 
thick as thick mush. Let it boil a few 
minutes, take it off, and pour it in pans. 
When cold, cut it in slices, flour it, and fry 
it in hot lard or sausage fat. Some prefer 
buckwheat meal this is added in the same 
manner as the Indian. Indian meal is 
preferable, as it is not so solid as buck- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 215 

wheat. Sweet marjoram may be added 
with the sage if preferred. 

BY the use of eye-glasses, you may see as much 
as is to be seen ; but bv the use of another kind of 

/ . 

glass you may see twice as much. 



SCRAPPLE, No. 2. 

205. Take the head, feet, and ears of 
a pig, and after thoroughly cleansing them, 
put them into salt and water, and boil them 
several hours, until the bones leave the 
flesh ; strain off the liquor they were boiled 
in, pick out all the bones very carefully, 
and with a large wooden spoon mash up 
the meat. Then pour the liquor over the 
meat, set it over the fire, and as soon as it 
begins to boil add as much Indian meal or 
buckwheat flour as will make it very thick. 
Stir it continually while it is boiling, which 
will require ten or fifteen minutes. In the 
mean time season it highly with Cayenne 
pepper, salt, and pulverized sage. Turn it 



216 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

out in pans to cool. When cold, cut it in 
slices, and fry them a nice brown on both 
sides. Buckwheat meal and Indian meal 
may be mixed in equal proportions if 
preferred. 

A NOBLE Lord asked a Clergyman once, at the 
bottom of his table, why the goose was always 
placed near to the parson ? " Really, my lord," said 
the clergyman, " I can give no reason for it ; but 
your question is so odd, that I shall never see a 
goose in future without thinking of your lordship!" 



MINCED PORK CUTLETS. 

206. Mince three quarters of a pound 
of lean roast pork and two shalots. Season 
with a saltspoonful of salt, half a saltspoon- 
ful of pepper, a mustardspoonful of fresh- 
made mustard, half a grain of Cayenne, a 
quarter of a saltspoonful of sage in fine 
powder, and a teaspoonful of baked flour; 
add a tablespoonful of pork gravy, and one 
well-beaten egg. Make up the meat into 
the form of small cutlets (five or six) of 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 217 

equal size, dredge them with baked flour, 
and fry (in plenty of boiling fat) till of a 
pale brown color (about eight minutes). 
Serve with apple sauce, made as follows : 
Peel and cut up four large apples; put 
them into a saucepan with two tablespoon- 
fuls of moist sugar, and two tablepoonfuls 
of brandy ; simmer for three quarters of an 
hour ; beat with a wooden spoon till quite 
smooth. Place the cutlets round the dish, 
and the sauce in the centre. 



IF it be difficult to rule thine anger, it is wise to 
prevent it. Avoid, therefore, all occasions of falling 
into wrath, or guard thyself against them whenever 
they occur. 



SAUSAGE MEAT. 



207. Twenty -five pounds of pork, half 
a pint of salt, one gill of rubbed sage, half 
a gill of black pepper, one tablespoonful of 
Cayenne pepper. 



218 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

IT is considered very creditable to men to have 
hearts of oak, but not half so creditable to have 
wooden heads. 



PIGS' FEET. 

208. Pigs' feet should be scraped and 
thoroughly cleaned, and boiled in water 
with a proper quantity of salt. When 
thoroughly tender, cut them in half, put 
them in a pan with some lard, and fry 
them a nice brown. If approved, some 
vinegar may be added to the gravy. They 
may be eaten hot or cold. 



SOUSED FEET. 

209. Take four or eight pigs' feet, and 
after thoroughly scraping and cleaning them, 
put them on to boil in some salt and water. 
They should cook very slowly until the 
meat is perfectly tender. Take out the 
large bones, cut each foot in four pieces, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 219 

season with Cayenne pepper and salt. When 
cold, pour cold vinegar over them. If pre- 
ferred, some grains of allspice and a sprig or 
two of mace may be added. 



HOG'S-HEAD CHEESE. 

210. Clean a pig's head nicely, wash it 
well, and boil it in very little water, with 
some salt. Let it boil until the bones fall 
from the flesh. Then take it up, take out 
all the bones and with a wooden spoon 
mash it up well, and return it to the water 
it was boiled in. Add red and black pepper, 
rubbed sage and sweet marjoram to the taste. 
Boil the whole down till it is quite thick 
and nearly dry ; then pour it in pans or 
forms, smooth it over the top with the back 
of the spoon, and stand it away to get cold. 
Cut it in slices and send it to the table. 
Some prefer spice in hog's-head cheese ; in 
that case, add a small quantity of ground 
cloves and mace. 



220 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

DR. FRANKLIN, when in England, used pleasantly 
to repeat an observation of his negro servant, when 
the Doctor was making the tour of Derbyshire, Lan- 
cashire, etc. " Every ting, Massa, work in dis 
country ; water work, wind work, fire work, smoke 
work, dog work, man work, bullock work, horse 
work, ass work, every ting work here but de hog ; 
he eat, he drink, he sleep, he do noting all day, he 
walk about like gentleman /" 



HOW TO COOK A HAM. 

211. Never put a ham in cold water, 
and be equally careful never to place one in 
boiling water. First, let the water become 
lukewarm, and then put the ham in. Let 
it simmer or boil lightly for four or five 
hours five is better than four then take 
it out and shave the rind off. Rub granu- 
lated sage into the whole surface of the ham 
so long as it can be made to receive it. 
Place the ham in a baking dish, with a 
bottle of champagne or prime cider. Baste 
occasionally with juice, and let it baste an 
hour in a gentle heat. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 221 

You that are rich have of all people the least 
cause to be idle ; God gives you more than others ; 
and is there any reason then that you should do less 
for God than others, and make your whole lives a 
long vacation ?" 



BOILED HAM. 

212. Wash and scrape your ham ; if it 
is not very salt it need not be soaked ; if old 
and dry, let it soak twelve hours in luke- 
warm water, which should be changed 
several times. Put it in a large vessel filled 
with cold water. Let it simmer, but be 
careful not to let it boil, as it hardens and 
toughens the meat. Allow twenty minutes 
to cook each pound of meat. When it is 
done, take it out of the water, strip off the 
skin, and serve it. Twist scalloped letter 
paper round the shank, or ornament it with 
sprigs of green parsley neatly twisted round 
it. If it is not to be eaten whilst hot, as soon 
as it is taken from the pot, set it away to get 
cold, then skin it, by which means you pre~ 



222 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

serve all the juice of the meat. It may be 
garnished as above, or, if you choose, you 
may glaze it. 



GLAZED HAM. 

213. Beat the yolks of two eggs very 
light, cover your ham all over with the 
beaten egg, then sift over some grated 
cracker, and then set the ham in the oven 
to brown the glazing. 

As lately a sage on a fine ham was repasting 

(Though for breakfast too savory I opine), 
He exclaimed to a friend, who sat silent and fasting, 

"What a breakfast of learning is mine I" 
"A breakfast of learning!" with wonder he cried, 

And laugh'd, for he thought him mistaken ; 
"Why, what is it else?" the sage quick!} 7 - replied, 

" When I'm making large extracts from Bacon!" 



MODE OF RE-DRESSING COLD ROAST PIG. 

214. When the shoulders are left 
entire, remove from them the skin, turn 
them, dip them into the best salad oil, then 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 223 

in bread crumbs highly seasoned with Cay- 
enne and salt. Broil them over a clear fire, 
and send them to table while hot. Serve 
with tomato sauce. 

" No man," says Mrs. Partington, " was better 
calculated to judge of pork than ray poor husband ; 
he knew what good hogs were, for he had been brought 
up with 'em from childhood /" 

A SERVANT girl received the following written 
character from a person who meant to recommend 
her : " This is to certify that Isabel Wier served 
with us During the last half-year, and we found her 
in every respect Creditable, and free from nothing 
that was in any way wrong /" 



A VERY NICE ENTREE FROM COLD 

ROAST PIG. 

215. Kemove the flesh from the bones, 
and also the skin, and cut into convenient 
pieces. Melt a bit of butter, the size of an

and continue to shake or toss them gently, 
but do not allow them to burn. Add a 
small bunch of parsley, a middling-sized 
blade of mace, some salt, a small quantity 
of Cayenne pepper, and half a pint of 
water. Let these boil gently until reduced 
nearly one third ; take out the parsley and 
mace, lay in the meat, and add two or three 
glasses of wine, and bring it slowly to the 
point of simmering. Stir to it the beaten 
yolks of three fresh eggs, and the strained 
juice of half a lemon. Serve hot. 

WHENEVER our neighbor's house is on fire, it 
cannot be amiss for the engines to play a little on 
our own. Better to be despised for too anxious ap- 
prehension, than ruined by too confident security. 



BREAKFAST DISH FROM COLD BACON. 

216. Cut the bacon into slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick, grate over them 
some crust of bread, and powder them well 
with it on both sides. Lay the rashers on

a cheese-toaster, and brown them on both 
sides. 

Excellent to accompany poached or fried 
eggs, and for a garnish around veal cutlets, 
or sweetbreads, or hashed calf's head, or 
dishes of green peas or beans. 

A FASTIDIOUS boarder, at a cheap establishment 
in New York, lately appeared at the table, when a 
rather unsavory ham presented itself for discussion. 
It looked very well, but the boarder said to his host, 
"How horrible it smells!" ''Well," replied the 
other, "what o' that? Take hold, man you come 
to the table to eat your victuals, not to smell 'em!" 



STEAKS FROM COLD ROAST PORK. 

217. Cut some slices from the leg, 
and season them with Cayenne pepper, 
salt, and pulverized sage. Broil them, and 
when thoroughly hot, baste them with 
butter. They should be served with apple 

or cranberry sauce.

CUTLETS FROM COLD ROAST PORK. 

218. Cut the lean part of the cold pork 
in slices, season them with Cayenne pepper, 
a little salt, and some finely-powdered sage. 
Broil them over a clear fire, and take care

A BREAKFAST DISH FROM COLD ROAST 

PORK. 

219. Cut the pork in slices, season 
them highly with Cayenne pepper, salt, 
and pulverized sage. Fry them slowly, and 
when of a fine brown take them out of

A PIE OF COLD ROAST MEAT AND APPLES. 

(AN ENGLISH DISH.) 

220. Cut some apples into quarters, 
and take out the core (preserving the pips 
and sticking them into the pulp) ; cut thick 
slices of cold fat bacon, and any sort of 
cold roasted meat; season with pounded 
ginger, pepper, and salt. Put into the 
dish a layer of each, and pour over the top 
a large cupful of ale. Cover the dish with 
a paste, and bake until nicely browned.

POTATO KALE. 

221. Six potatoes, half head of cabbage, 
two ounces of butter, one gill of cream. 
Put your cabbage on to boil, with a little 
salt in the water; when it is nearly done, 
pare your potatoes and put them in with the 
cabbage. When the potatoes are soft take

pan, or the pot they were boiled in, put the 
potatoes and cabbage into it, mash both very 
fine, add the butter and cream with salt and 
pepper to the taste. Set the pot over the 
fire and stir it till the potatoes are hot. 
Serve it immediately. This is very good 
with cold meat. 

A NOVEL WAY TO CLEAN A WATCH. " I Cannot 

conceive, my dear, what's the matter with my watch : 
I think it must want cleaning," exclaimed an indul- 
gent husband to his better half, the other day. 
" No, pa," said his petted daughter, " I know it 
don't want cleaning, because baby and I washed it 
in the basin ever so long this morning." 



POTATO LOAVES. 

222. Potato loaves are very nice 
when eaten with roast beef or mutton, 
and are made of any portion of the mashed 
roots, prepared without milk, by mixing 
with them a good quantity of very finely 
minced raw shallot, powdered with pepper 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 229 

and salt; then beating up the whole with 
a lump of butter to bind it, and dividing 
it into small loaves of a conical form, and 
placing them under the meat to brown, that 
is, when it is so nearly done as to impart 
some of the gravy along with the fat. 

OP much speaking cometh repentance, but in 
silence is safety. 



BOILED POTATOES. 

223. Prepare your potatoes, and let 
them stand in cold water, in an earthen pot, 
for three hours. Have ready a pot full of 
boiling water, with some salt in it, and drop 
in the potatoes half an hour before dinner 
is served. Have ready a colander, well 
warmed, throw the potatoes in it, shake 
them well, and put them in a vegetable dish, 
well warmed. 

SIR THOMAS OVERBURY says that the man who 

V 

has not any thing to boast of but his illustrious an- 
cestors, is like a potato the only good belonging 
to him is under ground. 



230 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

FRIED POTATOES. 

224. Pare the potatoes and cut them 
into four quarters, and divide each quarter 
into two; let them stand in cold water ten 
minutes ; drain, and wipe them quite dry ; 
throw them into a stew-pan half filled with 
boiling fat, and fry to a pale brown color. 
Take them out with a slice, and place them 
on a sheet of white blotting paper on a sieve, 
so as to absorb the fat before serving.

POTATO SALAD, 

(A GERMAN DISH.) 

225. Six potatoes, six onions, two 
ounces of butter, pepper, salt and vinegar 
to the taste. Boil the potatoes and the 
onions till they are soft; the onions require 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 231 

about as long again as the potatoes. Wipe 
out the pot in which the potatoes were 
boiled, mash the onions in it, slice the pota- 
toes, but do not mash them, and add to the 
onions, put in the butter, pepper, salt and 
vinegar ; set it over the fire and stir it till 
it is hot, when it will be ready for the table. 
Some persons prefer it without the vinegar. 

" SIRE, one word," said a soldier one day to 
Frederick the Great, when presenting to him a re- 
quest for the brevet of lieutenant. "If you say 
two," answered the king, " I will have you hanged." 
" Sign," replied the soldier. The king stared, 
whistled, and signed. 



POTATOES A LA-MAITRE D'HOTEL. 

226. Boil and peel the potatoes; let 
them grow nearly cold ; then cut them into 
slices tolerably thick, and warm them up in 
white sauce or melted butter, w r ith parsley 
chopped; put into it a little white pepper 
and salt, and the juice of half a lemon. Or 
boil the potatoes, and let them become cold. 



232 THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

then cut them into rather thick slices. Put 
a lump of fresh butter into a stew-pan, add 
a little flour, about a teaspoonful for a 
moderate dish ; when the flour has boiled a 
short time in the butter, add a cupful of 
water and a little cream ; beat all together, 
then put in the potatoes covered with 
chopped parsley, pepper, and salt ; stew 
them for a few minutes, and then take them 
from the fire ; add a little lemon-juice, and 
send to table.

COLD POTATOES WITH SPINACH OR CABBAGE. 

227. Mash cold potatoes, and moisten 
them with a little white sauce ; take cold 
cabbage or spinach, and chop very finely ; 
moisten them with brown gravy. Fill 
a tin mould with layers of potatoes and 
cabbage, cover the top, and put it into a 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 233 

gtew-pan of boiling water. Let it remain 
long enough to make the vegetables hot ; 
then turn them out and serve. This forms 
a very pretty dish for an entrie. Cold 
carrots and turnips may be added to soups ; 
or may be warmed up separately, and put 
into moulds and layers, and served the 
same as the potatoes and cabbage described 
above. 

" I LOVE you like any thing," said a young 
gardener to his sweetheart. " Ditto," said she. 
The ardent lover was sorely puzzled to under- 
stand the meaning of ditto. The next day, being 
at work with his father, he said, " Daddy, what 
is the meaning of ditto?" "Why," said the old 
man, " this here is one cabbage head, ain't it ?" 
"Yes, daddy." "Well, that ere's ditto." "Drat 
it!" ejaculated the indignant son, " she called me 
a cabbage head!" 



TO IMPROVE POTATOES OF BAD QUALITY. 

228. Potatoes are sometimes of very 
inferior quality, being deficient in starch. 
The method to improve them by cooking 



234 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

is, to peel tnem, and boil them gently, until 
nearly done. Then drain the water from 
them, and put them again upon the fire to 
make them hot without burning them; then 
mash them with a fork. The fork breaks 
them into pieces and allows the water to 
escape, thus very much improving the pota- 
toes. 



OLD POTATOES TO LOOK LIKE YOUNG ONES. 

229. Wash some large potatoes, and 
with a small scoop made for the purpose, 
form as many diminutive ones as will fill 
a dish ; boil them in two or three waters 
about three minutes each time, the water 
being put to them cold ; then let them steam 
till tender ; pour a white sauce over them, 
and serve with the second course. Old pota- 
toes prepared thus have been mistaken for 
young ones at the best tables.

HOOD states that the phrase " republic of letters" 
was hit upon to insinuate that, taking the whole 
lot of authors together, they had not a sovereign 
amongst them. 



SPINACH, No. 1. 

230. Wash it well through several 
waters, as it is apt to be gritty. Put it 
into a vegetable dish, and strew over the 
top, eggs which have been boiled hard and 
finely chopped, or poached eggs. 



SPINACH, No, 2, 

231. Pick off the stem of each leaf, and 
avoid using any that are old or discolored ; 
wash the spinach in several waters, and put 
it into a quart of boiling water with a des- 
sertspoonful of salt ; press it down, and let 
it boil rapidly (uncovered) for ten or twelve 
minutes j drain it through a sieve, and press 



236 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

out all the water; mince quite fine, and put 
it into a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, 
a saltspoonful of salt, half the quantity of 
white pepper, and a teaspoonful of sifted 
sugar. Stir for six or eight minutes. Place 
the spinach on a vegetable dish, smooth it 
over with a knife, and cut it into triangles. 
Garnish with fried sippets. Cut a slice of 
bread into small three-cornered pieces, and 
fry to a pale brown color in plenty of butter 
or oil.

6. To do good. 



BAKED TOMATOES, 

232. Put some tomatoes into a pan, 
with a small lump of butter on each. Put 
them in the oven, and bake them till the 
skin shrivels. Serve them hot. Each 
person at the table dresses them on his 
own plate.

TOMATO FRICANDEATI. 

233. Get some slices of veal cutlets, 
pound and wash them, season them with 
pepper and salt, and fry them slowly till 
they are done. They should be of a light 
brown on both sides. Stew some tomatoes 
very dry, strain them through a sieve to 
get out all the seeds, pour the pulp into the 
gravy after the meat has been taken out, 
and thicken it with a piece of butter rolled 
in flour. Pour this over the meat and serve 
it hot.

which put on and boil until nearly dry. 
Then add one tablespoonful of Cayenne 
pepper, one tablespoonful of black pepper, 
one teaspoonful of cloves, two tablespoonful s 
of mustard seed, and two tablespoonfuls of 
salt. Boil the whole a few moments, and 
when cold bottle it and cork it tightly. If 
this should not be quite salt enough, a little 
more may be added before it is boiled the 
last time. Put a tablespoonful of sweet oil 
on the top of each bottle before it is corked 
to exclude the air. 



M. DEBALZAC was lying awake in bed, when he 
saw a man enter his room cautiously, and attempt 
to pick the lock of his writing desk. The rogue 
was not a little disconcerted at hearing a loud 
laugh from the occupant of the apartment, whom 
he supposed asleep. " Why do you laugh ?" asked 
the thief. " I am laughing, my good fellow," said 
M. DeBalzac, "to think what pains you are taking, 
and what risk you run, in hope of finding money 
\>y night in a desk where the lawful owner can never 
find any by dayl" The thief "evacuated Flan- 
ders" at once.

STEWED TOMATOES, 

235. If they are not very ripe, pour 
boiling water over them, and let them stand 
a few minutes, when the skin will peel off 
very easily. Then cut them up, put them 
in a stew-pan without any water, and cook 
them till they are soft. If they prove too 
juicy, dip some of the water out, and mash 
them fine. Season with butter, Cayenne 
pepper, and salt. They may be thickened 
with bread crumbs or grated cracker if 
preferred. 

HUMANE DRIVER REWARDED. A poor Macedo- 
nian soldier was one day leading before Alexander 
a mule laden with gold for the king's use. The 
beast beinsr so tired that he was not able either to 

~ 

go or to sustain the load, the driver took it up and 
carried it, though with great difficult} 7 . Alexander 
seeing him just sinking under the burden and going 
to throw it on the ground, cried out, " Friend, do 
not be weary yet try to carry it right through to 
your tent, for it is all your own." 



240 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

238. Wash them, and cut them in two 
parts, round the tomato that is, so as the 
cells can be divested of the pulp and seeds 
which they contain. To six tomatoes, take 
half a pint of bread crumbs, one large onion 
finely chopped, one ounce of butter, pepper 
and salt to the taste. Fill the cells of each 
piece with the dressing, put two halves 
together, and tie them with a piece of 
thread. Put them in a pan with an ounce 
of butter and a gill of water, set them in a 
moderate oven, and cook them till they are 
soft. 



TOMATOES WITH CREAM GRAVY. 

237. Cut the tomatoes in half, and 
season them with pepper and salt ; then fry 
them in fresh lard. When they are brown 
on both sides, add some butter and cream ; 
thicken the gravy with butter and flour 
mixed as for drawn butter. Tomatoes pre-

A GENTLEMAN met a half-witted lad in the road, 
and placing in his hands a sixpence and a penny, 
asked him which of the two he would choose. The 
lad replied that " he wouldn't be greedy, he'd keep 
the littlest!" 



CELERY SAUCE. 

238. Wash two heads of fine white 
celery, and cut it into small pieces ; put it 
into a pint and a quarter of new milk, and 
simmer till quite tender (about an hour), 
then rub it through a fine sieve. Beat the 
yolks of four fresh eggs with a gill of thick 
cream, mix all together, and stir over a 
gentle fire for five or six minutes, till the 

sauce thickens, and serve as directed. 



WHEN in company at college, a general question 
arose among the young men, " What were their

CELERY DRESSED AS SLAW. 

239. Cut the celery in pieces about a 
quarter of an inch long. Make a dressing 
of the yolks of three eggs boiled hard, half 
a gill of vinegar, half a gill of sweet oil, 
one teaspoonful of French mustard, or half 
a teaspoonful of common mustard, with salt 
and Cayenne pepper to the taste. Pour this 
mixture over the celery, stir it well, and 
send it to the table. It should be kept in 
cold water, to make it crisp, until about 
fifteen minutes before it is sent to the table, 
then drain it and pour the dressing over.

CELERY STEWED WITH LAMB, 

(FRENCH FASHION*.) 

240. Take six neck chops, crack the 
bone of each across the middle, and put 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 243 

them into a stew-pan. Cut up and wash 
two large heads of celery and mix with the 
meat; pepper and salt to the taste. Roll 
two ounces of butter in a little flour and 
add to it, with half a gill of water. Cover 
it closely, and let it simmer slowly till the 
celery is soft. If the gravy stews away too 
much, add a little water ; and if it should 
not be quite thick enough, stir in a little 
flour mixed with cold water. 



BOILED DRIED BEANS. 

241. Put a piece of pickled pork in a 
pot with two quarts of water. In another 
pot put one quart of dried beans, which 
must have been carefully picked and 
washed. As soon as the beans begin to 
boil take them out, put them in a colander 
to drain, then put them in with the meat, 
and just cover the whole with water. Boil 
them till they are quite soft, and send them 
to the table.

"JEM," said a little boy who was boasting of his 
father's new house, " we have got such a fine por- 
tico, and mahogany doors, and plate-glass windows I 
and on the top is a cupola and it's going to have 
something else." " What is it?" asked his inter- 

O 

ested companion. ' Why, I heard father tell mother 
this morning that we are going to have a mortgage 
upon it 1" 



GREEN PEAS. 

242. These should be boiled in very 
little water, with a teaspoonful of salt to 
a pint of water ; and if the peas are not 
very sweet add a little sugar. When they 
are young, fifteen minutes is sufficient to 
boil them. Drain them, and add butter, 
pepper, and salt, to the taste. 

Two gardeners, who were neighbors, had their 
crops of early peas killed by the frost. One of 
them came to condole with the other. "Ah !" c.ried

me ! you seem to have a fine crop coming up ; what 
sort are they?" "Why, those are what I sowed 
immediately after my loss." "What! coming up 
already?" "Yes," replied the other, "while you 
were fretting, I was working /"

CARROTS A-LA-FRANCAISE. 

243. Scrape the carrots, cut the small 
ends into two, and the large ends into eight 
pieces. Boil in water, with a dessertspoon- 
ful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
for one hour ; drain on a cloth ; place them 
in a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, 
and shake them till the butter is nearly 
absorbed by the carrots ; pour in half a pint 
of new milk, and simmer gently for an hour. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs, place the carrots 
on a vegetable dish, stir the eggs into the 
milk, and simmer two minutes. Pour the 
sauce over the carrots and serve. 

PETER THE GREAT. When the Ambassador of 
Peter the Great was arrested for debt in London, 
in Queen Anne's reign, the Czar expressed his 
astonishment and indignation that the persons who 
had thus violated the respect due to the representa- 
tive of a crowned head, were not immediately put 
to death. His astonishment was considerably in- 
creased, when he was told that the sovereign of the 
country had no power to dispense with the laws, to 
which he was himself subject.

CARROTS WITH FLAVOR, AND CARROTS 

WITHOUT. 

244. When you are about to boil 
carrots do not scrape them, but first brush 
and then wash them. When cooked, rub 
off the skin with the back of the knife. 
The improvement in the flavor is very 
great, because the juice has been kept in. 
The carrot is more affected by the ordinary 
system of peeling or scraping than the 
potato, because the former contains a large 
proportion of sugar in a soluble form. 
Those who try this, will learn to estimate 
the difference of carrots with flavor and 
carrots without. 

A TRAVELLED once related, with all seriousness, 
to a company of persons, that he had passed 
through the five divisions of the earth ; and that, 
among other curiosities, he had met with one of 
which no writer had made mention. This, accord- 
ing to his account, was a huge cabbage, which had 
grown so broad and high, that fifty armed riders 
might have stationed themselves under a single 

O O 

leaf and performed their manoeuvres. Some one 
who heard him, deeming this exaggeration not 

O O o 

worth serious refutation, said, with assumed seri- 
ousness, that he too had been abroad as far as 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 247 

Japan, where, to his astonishment, he saw more 
than three hundred coppersmiths at work making 
a single kettle ; and within the same, were five hun- 
dred women polishing it. " Nonsense !" exclaimed 
the traveller, "what possible use could they have 
for so large a kettle?" "Usel why, to boil the 
cabbage which you saw I" 



EGG-PLANT. 

(FRENCH MODE.) 

245. Cut an egg-plant in half, but do 
not cut off the rind ; then with a sharp 
knife score it very deeply, both lengthwise 
and crosswise, but be careful not to break 
the skin in so doing. Place each half in a 
pan with the scored side up, season it with 
pepper and salt, and over this pour some 
sweet oil, or melted butter if preferred. Set 
it in an oven and cook it slowly till the 
plant is perfectly soft. The top should be 
brown.

BROWNED EGG-PLANT. 
246. Boil an egg-plant in water which 
has heen salted until it is perfectly soft. 
When done, take it out of the water, cut it 
in half, and scoop out all the inside ; mash 
it very fine, and to every teacupful of 
mashed egg-plant add one tablespoonful of 
grated cracker, and a dessertspoonful of 
butter, with salt and pepper to the taste. 
Put it in the dish it is to be served in, beat 
an egg light, spread a portion of it over 
the egg-plant, then strew on some grated 
cracker and lastly, spread over the re- 
mainder of the egg. Set it in the oven 
and brown it. Serve it hot. 

A BACHELOR friend of ours, who went for a week

tablespoonful of cream, and a little pepper 
and salt. Then mix all together and fry 
them in lard or butter. 



MOCK OYSTER FRITTERS, 

248. Wash some roots of salsify, grate 
them, and season with pepper and salt. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs very light, stir 
them into a pint of milk and enough flour 
to make a batter. Whisk the whites drv,

and add them gradually with the salsify to 
the batter. Dip out a spoonful at a time, 
and fry them like other fritters. 



CORN OYSTERS, 

249. One pint of grated green corn, 
two eggs, and as much wheat flour as will 
make it adhere together. Beat the eggs,

mix them with the grated corn, and add 
enough flour to form the whole into a paste. 
Fry them of a light brown, in hot lard. 



ASPARAGUS. 

* 

250. Scrape your asparagus, tie them 
up in small bunches, and boil them in a pot 
of water with some salt in it. Before you 
dish them up, toast some nice slices of 
bread, lay the asparagus on the toast, and 
pour rich melted butter over them. 



SUCCOTASH. 

251. One quart of green corn cut off 
the cob, one quart of lima beans, and two 
pounds of pickled pork. If the pork should 
be very salt, soak it an hour before it is put 
on to boil. Put the pork on to boil, and let 
it be about half cooked before the vegetables 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 251 

are put it. Then put in the corn (which 
must be cut off the cob) and the beans. 
Let them boil till they are tender. Take 
all up, put the meat on a dish, and the 
vegetables in a tureen. It should be a very 
thick soup when done. 

P. M. AND A. M. "I say, Jim," inquired a young

COLD SLAW, 

252. Cut a cabbage in half, and with 
a sharp knife shave it down very finely. 
Make a dressing of one egg well beaten, 
half a gill of vinegar, salt to taste, and a 
teaspoonful of butter. Beat the egg light,

Some prefer a little sugar in the egg and 



vinegar.

253. Cut the cabbage in half, and 
shave it very finely. Put it into a stew- 
pan, with a piece of butter, and salt to the 
taste. Pour in just enough water to pre- 
vent it from sticking to the pan. Cover it 
closely, and let it stew. Stir it frequently, 
and when it is quite tender, add a little 
vinegar, and serve it hot. 

AN Irish laiwyer of the Temple, having occasion 
to go to dinner, left these directions written, and put 
them in the key-hole of his chamber door: " I have 
gone to the Elephant and Castle, where you shall 
find me. If you can't read this note, carry it down 
to the stationer's and he will read it for you." 



THE HHUBAUB LEAF AS A GREEN 
VEGETABLE. 

254. Take the leaf (the youngest is 
the best) and divest it of the live stems that 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 253 

run to the right and left hands, and up the 
centre in connection with the fruit (those 
steins containing nearly all the fruit quali- 
ties of the rhubarb itself). The leaves 
should then be placed in boiling water, and 
kept boiling fast for twenty minutes ; after 
which well press them to exclude all liquor; 
and with the necessary condiments of the 
table it will be found a welcome substitute 
for ordinary vegetable, while its medicinal 
properties, as a rnild aperient, are upon a 
par with the rhubarb. To please the 
palates of the most fastidious, and lovers 
of spinach, it may be dished up as that 
article in the following way : After boiling 
and pressing, place it in a saucepan without 
water, let it simmer for ten minutes with a 
small quantity of butter, pepper, and salt 
and when done it will puzzle some of the 
finest connoisseurs to detect the difference. 

QUIN had a gardener who was very slow. 
"Thomas," said he, "did you ever see a snail?" 
" Certainly." "Then," rejoined the wit, "you must 
have met him, for you could never overtake him 1"

ENDIVE MAY BE COOKED AS A DINNER 

VEGETABLE. 

255. Endive forms an excellent vege- 
table when cooked for the dinner-table in 
the following manner. Take two good 
endives, not blanched, separate the leaves, 
and boil them in two waters to extract the 
bitter. If still bitter, use a third water. 
Ten minutes before they are ready, throw 
in a handful of sorrel leaves. When soft, 
take them out and strain them ; then put 
them back in the saucepan with a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut; season with 
pepper and salt, and add a little of any rich 
gravy. Shake them well over the fire, and 
serve as hot as possible. Or, boil the 
endive, then put it into cold water; drain 
the water off, and press it well out ; take a 
good tablespoonful of flour, and a piece of 
butter about the size of a walnut; mix 
them well near the fire ; put this mixture 
with the vegetable, and about a teacupful 
of gravy or water; add a little salt and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 255 

pepper, and stew till quite hot, taking care 
to avoid burning. 

THERE are some happy moments in this lone 

And desolate world of ours that well repay 
The toil of struggling through it, and atone 

For many a long sad night, and weaiy day. 
They come upon the mind like some wild air 

Of distant music, when we know not where, 
Or whence, the sounds are brought from, and 
their power, 

Though brief, is boundless. 



PEA TOPS USED AS AN ORDINARY 
VEGETABLE. 

256. A delicious vegetable for the table 
may be obtained by sowing peas in shal- 
low boxes, at intervals during the winter 
months. They will come up slowly, but 
strongly. When about five inches high, 
cut them for use, and boil them in the same 
way that cabbage is done. Dish up plainly, 
to be eaten as an ordinary green vegetable. 

THE clothes do much upon the wit, as weather 
Does upon the brain ; and then, sir, comes your 

proverb, 
The tailor makes the man. 



256 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

A VERY NICE AND NOVEL DISH WHERE 
WATER-CRESSES ARE PLENTIFUL. 

257. Collect a tolerably large quantity 
of water-cresses. This may be done by 
children on a holiday, affording them 
healthful recreation. Lay the cress in 
strong salt and water, to free it from 
insects. Pick, and wash nicely, and stew 
in water for about ten minutes. Drain and 
chop. Season with pepper and salt, add a 
little butter, and return it to the stewpan 
until well heated. Before serving, add a 
little vinegar, and put around the dish 
pieces of toast, or fried bread. The above, 
made thin, is a good substitute for parsley 
and butter, as a sauce for boiled fowl. 

AN old physician was declaiming upon the pro- 
pensity which a majority of people display for 
eating unripe fruit and vegetables. Said he, 
" There is not a vegetable growing in our garden 
that is not best when arrived at maturity, and 
most of them are positively injurious unless fully 
ripe." " I know one thing that ain't so good when 
it's ripe as 'tis green," interrupted a little boy, in 
a very confident but modest manner. " What's 
that?" sharply said the physician, vexed at having 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 2CT 

his principle disputed by a mere boy. "A cucum- 
ber /" responded the lad. The doctor winked his 
eyes, but said nothing. 



PIES PUDDINGS, DESSERT. 

PUFF-PASTE. 

258. One pound of butter, one pound 
of flour. Wash your butter in cold water 
to extract the salt ; work it well with a 
broad wooden spoon in order to get out all 
the water. Lay it between clean napkins, 
put it in a tin pan or plate, set it on the ice 
to get hard, but do not let it freeze. Sift 
your flour in a pan, cut the butter in four 
equal parts, cut one fourth in very small 
pieces in the flour, but do not touch it, as 
the warmth of your hands will make the 
paste heavy. Add to the flour as much 
cold water as will make it a stiff dough. 
Turn it out on your pie-board, roll it gently 
into sheets, cut one third of the remainder 

16 



258 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of the butter into small pieces and lay over 
it, sprinkle on a very little flour, fold it 
over, roll it out again, cut one half of the 
butter which is left in small pieces and lay 
on, put on a little flour, and fold it as 
before, roll it out again, and put on the 
remainder of the butter. It should now be 
set on the ice, but should not come in 
contact with it. When it is perfectly cold, 
roll it out into a sheet thinner in the centre 
than at the edges of your pie. Cut it with 
a very sharp knife the size you wish it. 
Fill with whatever you choose, and bake in 
a tolerably quick oven. 



PASTRY. 

259. The flour for pastry should be of 
the whitest and finest quality. It should 
be mixed with a broad knife, as the 
moisture and warmth of the hand makes 
it heavy. The butter should be of the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 259 

best quality, as if it is a little rancid it will 
taste. To make puff-paste, it should have 
all the salt washed out of it. Iron, or 
block-tin plates are the best for baking 
pastry. Always use cold water (in summer 
iced water) to mix pastry, and if it cannot 
be baked immediately set it away in a cool 
place. 



RHUBARB PIE, OR TART. 

260. Take the stalks from the leaves, 
and peel off the thin skin ; cut them into 
pieces about an inch long, and as you do so 
sprinkle a little fine sugar into the basin. 
For a quart basin heaped, take one pound 
of common lump sugar ; put the rhubarb 
into it, with a tablespoonful of water, and 
as it simmers shake the pan often over the 
fire. It will turn yellow at first, but keep 
it very gently doing until it greens, and 
then take it off. When cold, lay it in the 
tart dish, with only as much syrup as will 



200 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

make it very moist. Put a light crust over 
it, and when that is baked the tart will be 
done enough. Quarter the crust, and fill 
the dish with custard or cream. Many 
persons think the flavor of the rhubarb 
injured by taking off the peel. 

THE fashion of shaving the beard was introduced 
into Greece about the time of Alexander the Great. 
Its absence was at first, however, regarded as a 
mark of effeminacy, and was adopted onl} r by low 
persons and fops. Diogenes, one day meeting a 
man with a smoothly-shaven chin, inquired of him 
whether he shaved as a reproach to nature for 
having made him a man and not a woman.

TO PREPARE APPLES FOR PIES. 

261. Pare and core your apples, cut 
them in slices, and throw them into cold 
water. Then take them out of the water 
and put them into a stewpan. If the apples 
are tender, the water which adheres to them 
will be sufficient to cook them ; if not, a 
little more may be added. Cover the stew- 
pan, and place them near the fire. Let 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 261 

them stew till they are soft, and burst; 
then mash them, and add half an ounce 
of butter to each pint of the stewed 
apples. When they get nearly cold, add 
sugar, rose water, and nutmeg to the taste. 
AN arch bov beinsj at a table where there was a 

*. O 

piping hot apple pie, putting a bit into his mouth, 
burnt it so that the tears ran down his cheeks. A 
gentleman that sat by asked him why he wept. 
" Only," said he, "because it has just come to my 
remembrance that my poor grandmother died this 
day twelvemonth. " Phoo," said the other, " is that 
all ?" So, whipping a large piece into his mouth, 
he quickly sympathized with the boy, who, seeing 
his eyes brim, full, asked him, with a malicious 
sneer, why he wept? "Plague on you," said he, 
" because you were not hanged, you young dog, the 
same day your grandmother died 1" 



APPLE TAUT WITH QUINCE. 
262. Prepare the apples as for apple 
pie, and lay them in a dish. Then stew 
two quinces, with a little water, sugar, and 
butter, and pour them on the apples. Then 
add a layer of pounded sugar, and the rind 
of a lemon grated. ' Cover with pun-paste, 
and bake to a light brown. 



262 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

APPLE POT PIE, 

263. Pare and slice some apples, line 
a pot with paste, put in a layer of apples 
and some susrar then another layer of 

O i/ 

apples and sugar until the pot is full. 
Pour in a little water, cover the top with 
paste, leaving an opening in the centre to 
allow the escape of the steam. Hang the 
pot over a slow fire, or set it in an oven, and 
when the crust is brown and the apples 
soft, dish it with the side crust at the 
bottom of the dish, the apples over it, and 
the upper crust on the top. To be eaten 
with cream, while hot. 



A NICE WAY TO SERVE THE REMAINS 
OF AN APPLE PIE. 

264. Cut the crust into triangular 
pieces, and arrange them around the sides 
of a China bowl. Place the fruit next to 
the pieces of crust, and pour a nice custard 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 263 

into the centre. Should the fruit be de- 
ficient, roast or bake a few apples and place 
in the centre. 

A GENTLEMAN calling; one morning; on a female 

o o 

friend, was answered bv the servant that she was 

/ 

not at home. " Thank you, give her this," said he, 
handing a card, and giving the boy a sixpence. 
"Yes," said the lad, thrown off his guard by the 
unexpected gift, " I will give it to her while you 
wait !" 



PEACH POT PIE. 

265. Line the sides of a deep pot with 
a paste made in the proportion of half a 
pound of butter to one pound of flour. 
Then pare and slice some peaches, sugar 
them to your taste, and fill up the pot and 
cover the top with the paste, leaving an 
opening in the middle of the crust to permit 
the steam to escape while the pie is baking. 
Bake it in a moderately hot oven, and when 

> 

cold serve it with cream. 

IF you have a strip of land, do not throw away 
soap-suds. Both ashes and soap-suds are good 
manure for bushes and young plants. 



264 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOCK. 

PASTE FOR DUMPLINGS WITHOUT 
"SHORTENING." 

266. Put into a pan as much flour as 
will make dough enough for the number of 
dumplings required. Add a little salt, and 
pour over it as much boiling water as will 
make a soft dough. Stir it well with a 
knife, and cut it into pieces large enough to 
make one dumpling. 

THE following notice appeared on the wall of a 
meeting-house: "Anybody sticking bills against 
this church, will be prosecuted according to law or 
any other nuisance." 



CHEAP CRUST FOR DUMPLINGS. 

267. Boil about six good-sized potatoes, 
mash them with a teacupful of milk and a 
very small piece of butter, and salt to taste. 
Beat the potatoes and milk together till 
they are very smooth ; add to this flour 
enough to make dough ; lay a large cloth 
on your pie-board, flour it, roll your dough 
out, put the apples in it, roll the crust up 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 265 

to form one large dumpling, tie the cloth, 
and put it in boiling water. Boil it about 
an hour and a half. 

"BRIDGET," said a mistress to her Irish servant, 
" where's the cullender?" "An' sure, ma'am, I's 
jist after giving it to my sister's own cousin, 
Bridget 'Flaherty the thing's so full of holes it's 
no good at all !" 



DUMPLINGS MADE WITH APPLES. 

268. Make a good puff-paste crust, and 
roll it out a little thicker than a silver 
dollar. Pare some large apples, and core 
them with an apple scoop ; fill the opening 
with ground cinnamon, fine sugar, and 
finely-shred lemon peel. Then roll each 
apple in a portion of the puff-paste; tie 
them close in separate cloths, and boil them 
about one hour. Cut a small piece off the 
top of each dumpling, and pour in some 
melted butter; then lay the piece of crust 
on again ; place the dumplings in a dish, 
and sift fine sugar over them.

Q.UERY. Two boys amusing themselves at 
"snatch-apple," in a room thirteen feet high, find 
that b} T standing twelve feet from each other, the 
apple, which is suspended from the ceiling by a 
string, and in a right line between them, when put 
in motion, just touches each of their watery mouths. 
Required, the area of the section described by the> 
string and apple, the perpendicular height of each 
boy's mouth from the ground being five feet ? 



APPLE DUMPLINGS, No. 1. 

269. Make a paste of six ounces of 
butter to a pound of flour. Pare your 
apples, take out the cores, and cover them 
with the paste. Tie them in cloths, and 
boil them till the apples are tender. Serve 
with sugar and cream, or molasses and 
butter. 

DON'T JUDGE BY APPEARANCES. Coleridge, being 

~ 7 o 

seated at dinner opposite to a silent gentleman 
with a high forehead, theorized himself into an 
exalted opinion of that person's intellectual pow- 
ers. He was impatient to hear the stranger speak, 
feeling almost certain that, when he did, he would 

O ' 

utter something profound and original. His wish 
was presently fulfilled. A dish of apple dumplings 
having been placed before them, the rigid features 
of the intellectual gentleman gradually relaxed 
from a smile to a grin and rubbing his hand, he 
exclaimed, " Them's the jockej-s for mel" 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 267 
APPLE DUMPLINGS, No. 2, 

270. Scoop out the cores of the apples, 
and fill up the centre with a mixture of 
butter and sugar. Make a nice paste, take 
a lump of the proper size, enclose the apple 
in it, and boil the dumplings in nets in 
place of cloths. 



DUMPLINGS WITHOUT PASTE. 

271. Pare and core your apples or 
quinces ; clean some rice, by rubbing it in 
a clean dry cloth, but do not wet it. Dip 
each apple or quince in water, then roll it 
in the rice. Tie each dumpling in a cloth, 
and boil them until the rice is soft. 

Miss SPECKLES says, " The best vegetable pill 
is an apple dumpling ; for curing a gnawing at the 
stomach it may be relied upon." 



RICH PLUM PUDDING. 



272. Stone carefully one pound of best 
raisins, wash and pick one pound of currants. 



268 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

chop very small one pound of fresh beef suet, 
blanch and chop small, or pound, two ounces 
of sweet almonds and one ounce of bitter 
ones; mix the whole well together, with 
one pound of sifted flour, and the same 
weight of crumb of bread soaked in milk, 
then squeeze dry and stir with a spoon 
until reduced to a mash, before it is mixed 
with the flour. Cut in small pieces, two 
ounces each of preserved citron, orange and 
lemon peel, and add quarter of an ounce of 
mixed spice ; quarter of a pound of moist 
sugar should be put into a basin, with eight 
eggs, and well beaten together with a three- 
pronged fork; stir this with the pudding, 
and make it of a proper consistence with 
milk. Remember that it must not be made 
too thin, or the fruit will sink to the bottom, 
but be made to the consistence of good thick 
batter. Two wineglassfuls of brandy should 
be poured over the fruit and spice, mixed 
together in a basin, and allowed to stand 
three or four hours before the pudding is 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 269 

made, stirring them occasionally. It must 
be tied in a cloth, and will take five hours 
of constant boiling. When done, turn it out 
on a dish, sift loaf sugar over the top, and 
serve it with wine sauce in a boat, and some 
poured round the pudding. The pudding 
will be of considerable size, but half the 
quantity of materials, used in the same pro- 
portion, will be equally good. In addition 
to the wine-sauce, have a metal sauce-boat 
filled with brandy ; set it alight on the 
table, and pour a portion of it in a flame 
upon each slice of pudding. It will be 
found a great improvement. 

WHEN the late Lord Paget was ambassador at 
Constantinople, he, with the rest of the gentlemen 
who were in a public capacity at the same court, 
determined on one gala day to have each of them a 
dish dressed after the manner of their respective 
countries, and Lord Paget, for the honor of England, 
ordered a piece of roast beef, and a plum pudding. 
The beef was easily cooked, but the court cooks 
not knowing how to make a plum pudding, he gave 
them a receipt. " So many eggs, so much milk, so 
much flour and a given quantity of raisin's ; to be 
beaten up together, and boiled for three hours." 
When dinner was served up, first came the French 
ambassador's dish then that of the Spanish am-

dous pan, and bawling, " Koom for the English 
ambassador's dish." "By Jove," cried his lord- 
ship. " I forgot the bag, and these stupid scoun- 
drels have boiled it without one and in five gallons 
of water, too." It was a noble mess of plum broth. 



A DELICIOUS PLUM PUDDING WITHOUT 

EGGS. 

273. Take a coffee cup full of mashed 
potatoes, and one of carrots, which must 
be boiled and mashed apart ; add to these 
half a pound of flour, half a pound of suet, 
half a pound of raisins, half a pound of 
currants, half a pound of sugar, two ounces 
of candied lemon peel, two ounces of 
citron, the grated peel of a lemon, ten bitter 
almonds, and mixed spice to your taste. 
Mix all well together, and add a glass 
of rum or brandy, and a little milk if too 
stiff. Boil for five hours. These quantities 
make a very large pudding.

THE head of man is like a pudding, and whence 
have all rhymes, poems, plots, and inventions 
sprung but from that same pudding? AY hat is 
poetry but a pudding of words. 



AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR PLUM 
PUDDING AT SMALL EXPENSE. 

274. Take four ounces of each of the 
following ingredients ; sugar, suet, flour, cur- 
rants, raisins, and bread-crumbs ; and half a 
pint of milk ; mix them well together, and 
boil in a mould for three hours. Serve 
with wine or brandy sauce. 

A GENTLEMAN dining at a hotel where servants 
were few and far between ; despatched a lad among 
them for a plate of pudding. After a long time the 
lad returned, and placing it before the hungry gen- 
tleman, was asked : "Are you the lad who took my 
plate for this pudding ?" " Yes sir." " Bless me," 
resumed the hungry wit, " how you have grown "

AN EXCELLENT PUDDING OF PIECES OF 
STALE BREAD, Etc, 

277. Soak two pounds of pieces of dry 
stale bread, or pieces of stale toast, all 
night, in plenty of water, with a plate laid 
on the top of them, just to keep the bread 
under the water; next morning pour off 
and squeeze out all the superfluous water ; 
then well mash the pieces of bread, and 
mix with it half a pound of flour, a quarter 
of a pound of currants which have been 
cleaned, four ounces of suet chopped fine, 
half of a pound of sugar, and two teaspoon- 
fuls of fresh ground cinnamon ; then grease 
the inside of a baking dish with a bit of 
suet, put the pudding into it, and bake it 
for two hours. Or it may be tied in a clean 
floured cloth, set in boiling water, with a 
plate at the bottom, and boiled for the 
same time.

A LITTLE boy, nine or ten years of age, was called 
as a witness at a late trial at Cambridge. After the

oath was administered, the chief justice, with a 
view of ascertaining whether the boy was sensible 
of the nature and importance of an oath, addressed 
him : " Little boy, do you know what you have been

keeping pigs for Mr. Banvard." 



A VERY NICE PUDDING, MADE FROM 
STALE MUFFINS. 

280. Having some stale muffins, make 
pudding of them in the following manner. 
Put them into a pot of boiling water, and 
let them boil five minutes ; not more, or 
they will be quite soddened ; then take 
them up, and pull them in halves. They 
must not be cut, or they will become close 
and heavy. Pour over the halves of the

muffins some sweet sauce previously pre- 
pared, some jam, or any other kind of pre- 
serve. With a knife put the muffins 
together again, and spread some of the 
same kind of preserve on the top of each ; 
over that, pour some more sweet sauce, and 
serve. 

A COOK, famed for her frequent failures, in at- 
tempting hard words, being about to purchase a 
saucepan, asked for one lined with emanuel, as she 
preferred it for cooking. 



A PUDDING FROM FRAGMENTS OF BREAD, 

281. Put some pieces of stale bread 
into a pan, pour over them some boiling 
milk. When soft, mash the bread, and to 
each pint of the bread, stir in gradually 
three eggs well beaten and enough milk to 
make a batter. Pour the mixture into a 
pudding dish, sweeten it to the taste and 
grate into it some nutmeg. Bake the 
pudding in a quick oven. Serve it with

wine sauce, or if in season, with strawberries 
or peaches well sugared. 



TO SEND BOILED RICE TO THE TABLE 
THE FINEST CONDITION. 

282. Soak it for seven hours in cold 
water, to which a little salt has been added. 
Have a stew-pan ready, containing boiling 
water, into which put the soaked rice, and 
boil it briskly for ten minutes. Then pour 
it into a colander, set it by the fire to drain, 
and serve it up. The grains will be sepa- 
rate and very large. Rice should be pre- 
pared for puddings in this way. 

BE attentive to your neighbor at the dinner-table ;

When the milk begins to boil, stir in as 
much of the rice flour mixed as above, as 
will make the whole about as thick as a 
custard. When sufficiently boiled, add a 
small piece of butter and a little salt. Wet

your custard cups, fill them with the mix- 
ture, and when cold turn them out on a 
large dish, and serve with sugar and cream, 
or any sweet sauce. 

A GENTLEMAN meeting his coal merchant, the 
other day, inquired whether it was proper to lay in 
his winter fuel. " Coal is coal now, sir," said the 
merchant. To which his customer replied, " I'm 
very glad to hear it, for the last you sent me was 
all slate." 



GROUND RICE PUDDINGS, 

285. Moisten two ounces of ground 
rice with half a gill of new milk, and add a 
gill of boiling milk ; stir over the fire for 
ten minutes, then let it get cold. Beat two 
ounces of fresh butter to cream; beat three 
fresh eggs ; mix these well into the rice ; 
add the grated rind of half a lemon and 
three ounces of sifted loaf sugar. Beat the 
mixture for twenty minutes; butter six 
small moulds ; put an equal quantity into 
each, and bake in a quick oven about

eighteen minutes. Serve immediately, with 
loaf sugar sifted over. 

" MASTER at home ?" " No, sir, he's out." " Mis- 
tress at home?" "No sir, she's out." " Then as 
I'm dripping wet, I'll step in and sit by the fire." 
11 That's out too, sir!" 



A VERY NICE AND CHEAP DISH, 

286. Boil one pound of good rice (after 
being well washed) in plenty of water ; when 
soft, add one ounce of butter, and stir it in ; 
then add one tablespoonful of sugar. The 
rice should not be boiled in more water than 
it will absorb. Peel and slice six apples, 
take out the core and pips ; put them in a 
stew-pan with a little water; stew until 
tender, and mash them ; add a quarter of a 
pound of butter, and sugar to the taste. 
When done, place the rice on a dish; form 

a hole in the midst of it, in which place the 
mashed apple ; have ready for sauce a little

cream, nutmeg and sugar; pour it over the 
rice, and serve. 

WHY does the cook make more noise than the

PORTUGUESE SWEET RICE. 

287. Wash three ounces of rice, and 
boil it in a pint and a quarter of new milk, 
and a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar and 
a laurel leaf, till quite soft (an hour and a 
half). Take out the leaf, and let the rice 
stand off the fire for five minutes ; then stir 
in, by degrees, four fresh eggs, well beaten, 
and half a gill of thick cream. Stir over 
the fire till at boiling heat ; then let it stand, 
and stir it occasionally till nearly cold. Put 
it into a glass dish (or a pie dish), and stand 
it in a cold place for two hours. Just 
before serving, sift over the surface a tea- 
spoonful of powdered cinnamon or burnt 
almond dust.

BOILED RICE PUDDING. 

288. Take a pint of whole rice, steep 
it in a pint of boiled milk over night ; in the 
morning, take half a pound of beef suet, 
shred fine, and mix with the rice and milk, 
some grated nutmeg, and a little salt, with 
the yolks and whites of three eggs, a quar- 
ter of a pound of currants, a quarter of a 
pound of raisins, and as much sugar as will 
sweeten it; stir well together, tie it very 
close, and boil two hours. To be served 
with any kind of sweet sauce. 

FUN is the most conservative element of society, 
and ought to be cherished and encouraged by all 
lawful means. People never plot mischief when 
they are merry. Laughter is an enemy to malice, 
a fool to scandal, and a friend to every virtue. It 
promotes good temper, enlivens the heart and 
brightens the intellect. Let us laugh when we can

RICE PUDDING WITH FRUIT. 

289. Put your rice in a stew-pan, with 
very little milk ; that is, to one cup of rice 
one gill of milk. Stand it where it will be 
hot, but not boil ; when the rice has absorbed 
all the milk, add to it a quarter of a pound 
of dried currants, and one egg, well beaten. 
Boil it in a bag till the rice is tender, and 
serve it with sugar and cream. More fruit 
may be added to the rice if it should be pre- 
ferred. 

LESLIE dined one day with Lamb at a friend's 
house. Returning to town in the stage coach, 
which was filled with the returning guests, they 
stopped for a minute or two at Kentish Town. A 
woman stepped toward the door and said. " Are 
you full inside ?" Upon which Lamb put his head 
through the w r indow and said, " I am quite full 
inside ; that last piece of pudding of Mr. Gillarfs 
did the business for me!" 



RICE FRITTERS. 



290. Wash, drain, and dry three ounces 
of the best rice ; put it into a sauce-pan with 



284 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

three ounces of sugar, the thin rind of half 
a lemon, an inch of cinnamon, and nearly a 
pint of milk ; boil (stirring frequently) for 
three quarters of an hour ; then rub through 
a fine wire sieve. Beat three fresh eggs, 
yolks and whites separately; add the yolks; 
beat for ten minutes ; then add the whites ; 
beat five minutes more ; then fry in butter 
(in a small omelet pan) till of a golden 
color on both sides. Drain before the fire ; 
sift fine loaf sugar over, and serve on a 
neatly folded napkin. 

NOTE. The quantity given will make five fritters ; 
three quarters of an ounce of butter will be required 
for each. 

WRONG none by doing injuries, or omitting the 
benefits that are our duty. 



RICE FRITTERS, 

291. Boil a quarter of a pound of rice 
in a quart of rice milk. When the rice is 
perfectly soft, remove it from the fire. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 285 

When cold, add six eggs well beaten, and 
as much flour as will make a batter. Have 
ready a pan of hot lard, drop into it a large 
spoonful of the batter to form each fritter. 
Serve with wine sauce, or sugar and cream. 

IDLENESS is the parent of want and of pain : but 
the labor of virtue bringeth forth pleasure. 



PARADISE PUDDING. 

292. Six moderately-sized apples, and 
a quarter of a pound of beef suet finely 
chopped, a quarter of a pound of fine 
crumbs of bread, eight ounces of moist 
sugar, the grated rind and strained juice 
of a Seville orange, the eighth part of a 
nutmeg grated, four fresh eggs, and a table- 
spoonful of rum. Mix these ingredients,

hours or bake in a moderate oven for an 
hour and a half. Serve with cream. 

A COOL RETORT. Henderson, the actor, was sel- 
dom known to be in a passion. When at Oxford, 
he was one day debating with a furious fellow- 
student, who threw a glass of wine in his face. 
Mr. Henderson coolly took out his handkerchief, 
wiped his face, and said, " That, sir, was a digres- 
sion, now for the argument." 



APPLE PUDDING. 

293. Half a pound of mashed apple, 
half a pound of butter, half a pound of 
sugar, five eggs, half a nutmeg, two table- 
spoonfuls of brandy, or rosewater if pre- 
ferred. Peel the apples and core them ; cut 
them in small pieces, and stew them in 
very little water till they are soft. Pass 
them through a sieve to free them from 
lumps. Beat the butter and sugar smooth ; 
whisk the eggs, and add to it ; then stir in 
the apples (which should be half a pound 
when mashed), brandy or rosewater, and 
nutmeg. Cover your pie plates with a rich 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 287 

crust, and bake in a moderate oven. These 
are very rich. 



AVOID extremes ; forbear resenting injuries so 
much as you think they deserve. 



SWISS APPLE PUDDING. 

294. Line a deep dish with a rich 
paste, put in a layer of sliced apples, over 
which sprinkle some sugar, then add an- 
other layer of apples and sugar until the 
dish is full. Cover the top with crust, 
leaving a large opening in the centre. Pour 
in a spoonful or two of water, and bake in 
a moderate oven. Peaches are very good 
prepared in the same manner. 

CAPTAIN MARRYAT expressed the opinion, in his 
book of American Travels, that a British army of 
thirty thousand men could walk from one end of 
the Union to the other. We guess they would fre- 
quently "break," like some trotting horses, into a 
ran.

' .; GUERNSEY PUDDING. 

295. Peel, core, and quarter six mode- 
rate-sized apples. Put them into a saucepan 
with half a pound of loaf sugar, the thin 
rind of a lemon, two cloves, an inch of 
cinnamon, the sixth part of a nutmeg 
grated, and a wineglassful of white wine. 
Boil fast, and stir till they become a rich 
marmalade ; then take out the spice and 
peel, and put the apples in a basin to cool. 
Wash three ounces of the best rice, and 
boil twenty-five minutes in a pint of new 
milk ; drain ; sweeten the rice with two 
ounces of sifted sugar. Cut into shreds six 
ounces of mixed candied peel; beat five 
fresh eggs, whites and yolks separately. 
Mix all the ingredients together, adding 
the whites (well frothed) last. Beat ten 
minutes. Make a puff paste, line a plain 
mould, put in the mixture, and bake in a 
moderate oven an hour and a quarter. 
Turn out carefully, and serve.

BREAD AND APPLES-RUSSIAN FASHION. 

296. Make a syrup of one pound and 
a half of sugar and one pint of water. Put 
into the syrup twenty-four good apples, 
peeled and sliced, and keep it stirred until 
it becomes a thick marmalade. Put it into 
a mould until quite cold, then turn it out 
upon a dish ; have a few spoonfuls of 
currant jelly melted over the fire ; add a 
glass of rum, and when partly cold pour 
over, and serve with whipped cream in the 
centre, flavored with oransre.

297. Boil one pound of rice (well 
washed) in plenty of water. When well 
boiled, add one ounce of butter, and stir it 
round ; then add one tablespoonful of sugar.

290 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

The rice should not be boiled in more water 
than it will consume. Peel and slice six 
apples, take out the core and pips, put them 
in a stew-pan, with six slices of beet-root and 
a pint of water. Stew until all is tender. 
Mash them up together with a little butter 
and sugar. The beet-root ought to have 
given a nice pink color to the apples, and 
improved the flavor. When done, place the 
rice which is ready on a dish ; form a well 
or hole in the midst of the rice, in w r hich 
place the apple. Have ready a small 
quantity of sauce, made with a little cream, 
butter and sugar, which pour over the rice, 
and serve. 

THE greatest truths are the simplest; the greatest 
men and women are sometimes so too. 



APPLE MIROTON. 

298. Peel, core, and slice twenty fine 
apples; melt a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, and stir in it half a pound of sugar, 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 291 

the peel of one lemon grated, and the juice 
of two. Fry the apples in this mixture, 
and serve them in a dish. 

DEFINITION OF STEAM. "Pray, sir," said an old 
lady to a very pompous-looking old gentleman who 
was talking loudly about steam power, " Pray, sir, 
what is steam?" "Steam, ma'am, is, ah! steam 
is eh? ah! steam is steam!" "I knew that 
chap couldn't tell } T e," said a rough-looking fellow 
standing by, "but steam is a bucket of water in a 
tremendous perspiration !" 



APPLES BUTTERED, 

299. Peel and core apples of the 
choicest kind, stew in their syrup as many 
as will fill the dish, and make a marmalade 
of the rest. Cover the dish with a thin 
layer of marmalade ; place the apples on 
this, with a bit of butter in the heart of 
each; lay the rest of the marmalade into 
the vacancies. Bake in the oven to a pale 
brown color, and powder with sugar. 

QUARRELS. Two things, well considered, would 
prevent many quarrels. First, to have it well 



292 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 



ascertained whether we are not disputing about 
terms, rather than things ; and secondly, to ex- 
amine whether that on which we differ is worth 
contending about. 



APPLES WITH CUSTARD. 

300. Pare and core some apples, and 
bake or stew them with, as little water as 
possible, and enough sugar to sweeten them. 
When the apples are soft, put them into a 
pie dish, and let them stand till cold ; then 
pour over them an unboiled custard, and 
set the dish into an oven or before the fire 
until the custard is thick. This may be 
eaten either hot or cold. 

HE that likes a hot dinner, a warm welcome, new 
ideas, and old wine, will not often dine with the 
great. 



APPLE CHARLOTTE. 

301. Peel, core, and slice one dozen 
large-sized apples, and stew them with half 
a pound of sugar, one ounce of butter, the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 293 

peel of one lemon, half a stick of cinna- 
mon, and half a pint of water. Continue 
boiling them until the mixture becomes a 
thick paste. Line the bottom and side of 
a mould with thin pieces of bread dipped in 
clarified butter. Fill the space with the 
apple marmalade, and cover the whole with 
a piece of bread dipped in clarified butter. 
Bake it in a hot oven till it is of a pale 
brown color, and when done, turn out, and 
serve in a dish. 

SOMETIMES a name will excite a remark. All the 
papers copied the marriage of Mr. Apple and Sarah 
Apple ; but we could see no impropriety in making 
the two apples into one pair ! 



BAKEWELL PUDDING. 

302. Cover a deep dish with a rich 
paste, over which spread raspberry or any 
kind of jam. Let the jam be spread an 
inch thick. Beat together half a pound of 
sugar and half a pound of butter. Whisk

butter and sugar. Pour the mixture over 
the jam in the dish, place it in the oven 
and bake it. 



POTATO PUDDING. 

303. Stir together three quarters of a 
pound of butter, and the same quantity of 
sugar ; when they are beaten to a cream, 
add a pound of potatoes mashed very fine, 
seven eggs beaten very light, one gill of 
brandy and one of cream. Make a light 
paste cover, take four pie plates, cut the 
edges nicely, and fill them with the above 
mixture. When baked and cool, slip 
them on plates for the table. 



ARROW-ROOT PUDDING. 

304. Mix four tablespoonfuls of arrow- 
root in some cold milk. Boil in half a pint 



THE TOTING WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 295

take them out and pour the hot milk over 
the dissolved arrow-root, stir it and set it 
away to get cold. Beat five eggs and stir 
them into the cold arrow-root with as much 
sugar as will make it quite sweet. Butter 
a deep dish, pour in the mixture and bake 
it. When served, ornament the top with 
jelly or fresh fruit, whole or sliced. 



ARROW-ROOT PUDDING. 

305. Dissolve three tablespoonfuls of 
arrow-root in cold milk, beat three eggs very 
light and add to the milk. Then pour the 
mixture into a pint of boiling milk and 
bake it. To be eaten with sugar, butter 
and wine, beaten together. This pudding is 
to be made as dinner is put upon the table. 



296 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

BUTTERMILK PUDDING. 

308. Mix a pint of new milk with half 
a pint of buttermilk. Turn it to a curd 
with some rennet, drain off the whey, and 
mix with the curd some bread crumbs, a 
little grated lemon peel, two ounces of but- 
ter, and three eggs well beaten. Add sugar 
enough to make it quite sweet. Line your 
pie plates with rich paste, pour in the above 
mixture, and bake in a rather quick oven. 

THE ROYAL DARDANELLES. A vounsf man who

had travelled much, thought he could give as truth 
everything that passed through his head. Once, as 
he boasted having seen all the crowned heads of

Europe, somebody asked him: ' Have you seen the 
Dardanelles too ?" The boaster, thinking that they 
were some princes that bore that name, replied, 
" Of course I have seen them, since I dined several 
times with them." 



SCOTCH PUDDING. 

% 

307. Mix together one pint of milk, a 
little salt, four eggs, and enough flour to 
make a thin batter. Bake the pudding

stirred together are suitable for sauce. 



CHESHIRE PUDDING. 

308. Make a good paste of flour and 
butter. Roll it thin, and cut it into strips 
about six or eight inches wide. Spread, on 
these strips of paste, some fruit jam or 
marmalade. Roll the strips ; wrap the roll 
in a well floured pudding cloth and boil it 
for two or three hours according to the size 
of the pudding. Wine sauce or cream sauce 
may be served with it. 



COCOANUT PUDDING. 

309. Beat together three quarters of a 
pound of sugar and three quarters of a 
pound of butter ; stir into this one pound of 
grated nut, and lastly the whites of nine

eggs beaten to a froth, a wineglass of brandy 
and two tablespoonfuls of rose-water. 

A SCOTCH famity removed to London, wished to 
have a sheep's head, prepared as they were accus- 
tomed to at home, and sent a servant to the butcher's 
to procure one. " My gude man," said she to the 
butcher, " I want a sheep's head." " There's plenty 
of them," replied he; "choose which you will." 
" Na," said she, 'that winna do ; I want a sheep's 
head that will sing (singe)." " Go, you idiot," said 
he ; " who ever heard of a sheep's head that could 
sing." " Why," replied she in wrath, " it's ye that 
are the idiot ; for sheep's head in Scotland can sing ; 
but I discover yer English sheep are just as grit 
fules as their owners, and they can do naething as 
they ocht." 



BAKED COCOANUT PUDDING.

or a mould ; put in the pudding, and bake 
in a moderate oven about an hour and a 
quarter. Turn out carefully, and serve. 
This pudding may also be boiled ; it requires 
three hours. Serve with thick cream, and 
sugar sifted over. 

A BARRISTER once tormented a witness with ques- 
tions, until he declared himself to be so exhausted 
that he could not proceed without a drink of water. 
Upon this the judge remarked, " I think, sir, you 
must have done with the witness now for you have 
pumped him dry." 



COCOANTTT PUDDING.

to it its weight of sifted sugar. Whisk the 
white of one egg very dry ; stir the whole 
together; butter some white paper; drop 
the mixture on in small balls, and bake

313. Grate one dozen ears of corn. 
Add to this, three eggs well beaten, a little 
salt, an ounce of butter, and flour enough

INDIAN PUDDING. 

316. Boil a quart of milk, and stir 
into it while boiling as much Indian meal 
as will make it into a mush. Boil it ten 
minutes, add some salt, and two ounces of 
butter. When it is cool, stir in four eggs, 
which should be first beaten very light; 
add as much sugar as required ; grate some 
nutmeg into it, and stir in three or four 
tablespoonfuls of brandy. Line your pud- 
ding dishes with paste, pour in the above 
mixture, and bake them. 

SUPERFICIAL KNOWLEDGE. The profoundly wise 
do not declaim against superficial knowledge in 
others, so much as the profoundly ignorant. On 
the contrary, they would rather assist it with their 
advice, than overwhelm it with their contempt ; for 
they know that there was a period when even a 
Bacon or a Newton were superficial and that he 
who has a little knowledge, is far more likely to get 
more than he that has none. 



PUMPKIN PUDDING. 



317. A quarter of a pound of butter, 
sugar to the taste, eight eggs, two table- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 303 

spoonfuls of brandy, one teaspoonful of cin- 
namon, one teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
one pint of mashed pumpkin. Stew the 
pumpkin in very little water, mash it fine, 
and add the butter to it whilst it is hot. 
Whisk the eggs, and stir into the pumpkin 
when it is cool enough, and add the other 
ingredients. Bake in a light paste. 

A GENTLEMAN walking out in some meadows, one

evening observed a reat number of rats in the act

of going from one place to another, which they are 
in the habit of doing. He stood perfectlj* still, and 
the whole troop passed close to him. His astonish- 
ment, however, was great, when he saw an old blind 
rat, which held a piece of stick at one end of his 
mouth, while another rat had hold of the other end 
of it. In this way he was leading his blind com- 
panion. 



FRUIT PUDDING,

of good baking powder, and a little salt. 
Mix to the consistency of drop biscuit with

tin pail and lay in it a layer of the batter, 
then a layer of any kind of fresh small 
fruit, alternating them until the vessel is 
filled. Cover tight, and steam an hour and 
a half. Eat with liquid sauce. This is 
excellent without either milk or eggs. 



PEACH CHARLOTTE. 

319. Line the bottom and sides of a 
dish with slices of fresh sponge cake. Pare 
some ripe peaches, cut them in halves, 
sprinkle sugar over them, and fill up the 
dish. Then whisk a pint of sweetened 
cream ; as the froth rises, take it off till all 
is done. Pile the cream on the top of the 
peaches and send it to the table. 

A BRIGHT IDEA. When the British entered 
Lucknow, the Highlanders' piper, who had lost his 
way, suddenly found one of the enemy's cavalry, 
sabre in hand, about to cut him down. His rifle 
had been fired off, and he had no time to raise his 
bayonet. "A bright idea," said he afterward, when 
relating the story, " struck me ; all at once I seized 
my bag-pipes and gave forth a shrill tone, which so 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 305 

startled the fellow that he bolted like a shot, evi- 
dentty imagining it was some infernal machine. My 
pipes saved my life." 



LEMON PUDDING. 

320. Half a pound of sugar, a quarter 
of a pound of butter, five eggs, the grated 
yellow rind and juice of one lemon. Beat 
the butter and sugar to a cream. Whisk 
the eggs and add to it, then stir in the 
lemon juice and grated rind. Make a paste, 
cover your pie plate, pour in the mixture, 
and bake in a moderate oven. Two table- 
spoonfuls of brandy may be added, if pre- 
ferred, to flavor it. 

" IF I am not at home to-night at ten o'clock," 
said a husband to his better half, "don't wait for 
me." "I won't, my dear," replied the lady, signifi- 
cantly. And what do you think she did ? At ten 
o'clock, precisely, she slipped on her bonnet and 
went for him, and gave him a bit of her mind before 
a large company.

How AN OLD LADY SECURED GOOD PUDDINGS. 
An old gentlewoman, who lived almost entirely on 
puddings, told us it was a long time before she could 
get them made uniformly good, till she made the 
following rule : If the pudding was good, she let 
the cook have the remainder of it ; if it was not, 
she gave it to her lap-dog. But as soon as this 
resolution was known, poor little Bow-wow seldom 
got the sweet treat after.

JAM ROLLED PUDDING. 

322. Make a paste with six ounces of 
finely-chopped suet and three quarters of 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 307 

a pound of flour ; roll it out a quarter of an 
inch thick. Spread it over with half a 

* 

pound of any kind of jam. Wet the edge- 
of the paste all round ; roll it up into the 
form of a bolster ; press the edge to make it 
adhere ; tie it in a cloth ; put it into a pan 
of boiling water, without bending it, and 
boil quickly for an hour and three quarters. 
Turn out carefully, cut the pudding into 
six pieces, and serve the cut side uppermost. 
Marmalade, chopped apples, lemon juice, 
and currants, may be used instead of jam 
for a change. 

GOOD JAM. Crowd ten fashionably-dressed ladies 
into one stage coach. 



BOILED BATTER PUDDING. 

323. Three eggs, one ounce of butter, 
one pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of 
flour, a little salt. Put the flour into a 
basin, and add sufficient milk to moisten it ; 
carefully rub down all the lumps with a 



308 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

spoon, then pour in the remainder of the 
milk, and stir in the butter, which should 
be previously melted ; keep beating the 
mixture, add the eggs and a pinch of salt, 
and when the batter is quite smooth, put 
into a well-buttered basin, tie it down very 
tightly, and put it into boiling water. 
Move the basin about for a few minutes 
after it is put into the water, to prevent the 
flour settling in any part, and boil for one 
hour and a quarter. This pudding may 
also be boiled in a floured cloth that has 
been wetted in hot water it will then take 
a few minutes less than when boiled in a 
basin. Send these puddings very quickly 
to table, and serve with sweet sauce, wine 
sauce, stewed fruit, or jam of any kind. 
When the latter is used, a little of it may 
be placed round the dish in small quantities 
as a garnish. 



QUIN was at a small dinner party. There was a 
delicious pudding, of which the master of the house 
begged him to partake. A gentleman had just 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 309 

before helped himself to an immense piece of it. 
" Pray," said Quin, looking first at the gentleman's 
plate and then at the dish, "which is the pudding?" 



BLACK-CAP PUDDING. 

324. Make a thin light batter, and 
just before it is poured into the cloth, stir 
to it half a pound of currants, well cleaned 
and dried. These will sink to the lower 
part of the pudding and blacken the surface. 
Boil it the usual time, and dish it with the 
dark side uppermost. Send it to table with 
a sweet sauce. 

IT is said that a Chinaman, no matter where he 
finds himself, is never perplexed. He always has 
his cue. 



A PUDDING FOR A PRINCE. 

325. Blanch six bitter, and two ounces 
of sweet almonds, boil them twenty minutes 
in the third of a pint of new milk, then 



310 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

pound them to a paste. When the milk is 
nearly cold, add four well-beaten fresh eggs, 
half a gill of thick cream, and two table- 
spoonfuls of brandy ; rub six ounces of stale 
sponge-cake to crumbs. Mix these ingre- 
dients well, and beat for ten minutes ; stir 
in two ounces of sifted loaf sugar. Butter 
a mould, stick it round in Vandykes with 
dried cherries, pour in the mixture, tie it 
over with writing paper spread with butter, 
and steam over fast-boiling water for an 
hour and three quarters. Serve with sauce. 

A LADY made a complaint to Frederick the Great, 
king of Prussia. "Your majesty," said she, "my 
husband treats me badly." " That is none of my 
business," replied the king. " But he speaks ill 
of you," said the lady. "That," he replied, "is 
none of your business I" 



COLLEGE PUDDING. 



326. Four eggs, one pint of milk, a 
little salt, flour to make a rather thin 
batter, one dessertspoonful of dissolved 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 311 

carbonate of ammonia. Beat the yolks of 
the eggs very light, add the salt, milk, and 
flour. The batter must not be thick. Beat 
the whole very hard for ten or fifteen min- 
utes, then stir in gently the whites of the 
egg, which should have been whisked very 

drv. Do not beat the batter after the 

/ 

whites are in, only stir it sufficiently to 
incorporate them with it. Lastly, add the 
ammonia. Butter well a cake mould or 
iron pan, pour in the mixture, and bake it 
in an oven about as hot as for bread. This 
pudding is very nice with wine or lemon 
sauce. Cream sauce may be served with it 
if preferred. 



RAILWAY PUDDING. 



327. Flour, suet, sugar, currants, and 
raisins, of each ten ounces ; grated potatoes 
and carrots, together ten ounces ; one nut- 
meg and two ounces of candied orange peel,

well mixed together, and boiled for several 
hours. To be served with brandy sauce. 

THERE exists in human nature a disposition to 
murmur at the disappointments and calamities 
incident to it, rather than to acknowledge with 
gratitude the blessings by which they are more 
than counterbalanced. 



ENGLISH MOLASSES PUDDING. 

328. A quarter pound of raw potatoes, 
scraped, a quarter pound of raw carrots, 
scraped, a quarter pound of currants, and 
the same quantity, each, of suet chopped 
fine, and flour; a little salt and allspice. 
Mix all these well together, and make it 
the consistence of a pudding for boiling by 
stirring in molasses. About two tablespoon- 
fuls will be enough, or it may require rather 
more. This should be put into a greased 
pudding mould and boiled two hours. It 
may be served up either with or without 
sweet sauce. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 313 

FOR a man to make mere recreations his main 
actions and grand employments, is full as foolish 
and unreasonable as if he should make all his diet 
of physic and sauces, and his whole garment of 
nothing but fringes. 



VICTORIA'S PUDDING. 

329. Three ounces of stale French roll 
in fine crumbs, two ounces of sweet almonds, 
blanched and pounded, half an ounce of 
ratafias, three ounces of loaf sugar, two 
ounces of beef marrow, chopped, one ounce 
of baked flour, half a pint of milk, and three 
fresh eggs ; mix these ingredients, and beat 
them briskly for ten minutes, then let it 
stand in a cool place for an hour ; beat 
again for ten minutes, put it into a mould 
rubbed well with butter, and tastefully 
stuck with dried cherries or raisins (stoned) ; 
tie a cloth over, put it into plenty of boiling 
water, and boil fast for two hours and a 
half.

AN EXCELLENT FAMILY PUDDING OF COLD 
POTATOES, WITH EGGS, ETC. 

330. Take some cold potatoes, bruise 
them through a colander with a wooden 
spoon ; then beat up eggs with a pint of 
good milk, and stir in the potatoes the 
proportion of eggs to potatoes should be four 
eggs to six large or twelve middle-sized 
potatoes ; sugar and season to taste ; bake 
half an hour. A little peach marmalade, or 
any kind of jam or preserves may be eaten 
with it. 

THE proof of a pudding is in the eating ; the 
proof of a woman is in making the pudding ; and 
the proof of a man is in being able to appreciate 
both. 



A SAVORY OR SWEET DRIPPING PUDDING. 

331. Six ounces of dripping to twelve 
ounces of flour, half of the dripping to be 
well rubbed into the flour, with a little salt; 
then, with water, work into a stiff paste; 
roll it out thin, and add the remainder of 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 315 

the dripping by spreading it thinly over the 
paste, then fold it over, and roll it out 
again ; repeat the process, and then work 
into a round pudding ; put it into a basin ; 
set it in boiling water, and continue to boil 
for two hours. This may be eaten as a 
sweet pudding, with jam, molasses, or sugar. 

WHEN, in a case of doubtful morality, you feel 
disposed to ask, " Is there any harm in doing this ?" 
pray answer it by asking yourself another, " Is 
there any harm in letting it alone ?" 



PUDDING OF CALF'S FEET. 

332. Pick the meat from three well- 
boiled and cleaned calf's feet ; chop it fine 
with half a pound of fresh beef suet ; grate 
the crumb of about half a pound of bread ; 
shred some orange-peel, and some citron to 
taste ; beat six eggs into a froth ; mix these 
ingredients thoroughly together, and add a 
wineglassful of brandy, and half a nutmeg

grated ; boil in a cloth for three hours ; 
serve with sweet sauce. 

ALL the influence which women enjoy in society, 
the wholesome restraint which they possess over 
the passions of mankind, their power of cheering 
us when old, depends so entirely upon their per- 
sonal purity, that to insinuate a doubt of its real 
value is wilfully to remove the broadest corner- 
stone on which civil society rests, with all its bene- 
fits and all its comforts. 



TAPIOCA PUDDING. 

333. Soak in a quart of water eight 
tablespoonfuls of tapioca, until it is quite 
soft ; then add five eggs well beaten, nutmeg 
and wine or rose water, to your taste. It 
needs no sauce, and may be made as sweet 
as custard. The tapioca needs washing first 
in cold water. Bake it in a buttered dish, 
and have it out of the oven long enough to 
be only warm when eaten. 

BISHOP CUMBERLAND, being told by some of his 
fHends that he would wear himself out by intense 
application, replied in the words of Bacon, " It is 
better to wear out than rust out." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 317 

SODA PUDDING. 

334. Mix together four eggs, four tea- 
cupfuls of flour, one of brown sugar, the 
same quantity of butter, and a teaspoonful 
of soda. Bake the pudding in a mould, and 
serve it with wine sauce, which may be 
made with milk, instead of water. 

IF thou bearest slight provocations with patience, 
it shall be imputed unto thee for wisdom ; and if 
thou wipest them from thy remembrance, thy heart 
shall not reproach thee. 



AMSTERDAM PUDDING. 

335. Half a pound of sweet, and six 
bitter almonds, blanched and pounded to a 
paste, half a pound of fresh butter, beaten to

apples, chopped, a quarter of a pound of 
currants, washed and rubbed dry, half a 
pound of orange marmalade, half a pint of 
thick cream, a wineglassful of Schiedam, 
and six fresh eggs well beaten. Mix the 
almonds, butter, half of the sugar, the cream 
and eggs, and beat till in a smooth, soft 
paste. Mix all the fruit together ; add the 
remainder of the sugar and the spirit. But- 
ter a tin cake mould, and lay in the almond 
mixture and fruit in alternate layers till all 
is used up ; bake in a moderate oven about 
two hours. Turn out carefully and serve, 
hot or cold. 

THE arts of life, in a great measure, consist of 
the saving and judicious use of waste matter. Paper 
is merely the refuse linen, cotton, and tow of the 
rags of society, the left-off clothes of the rich and 
the poor. These rags are carefully collected and 
after having served the inferior purpose of clothing 
the body, they are made instrumental in adorning 
the mind. They are translated from the temporal 
to the spiritual sphere ; they are invested with hoi}' 
orders, and made to administer consolation to the 
afflicted, and courage to the fearful.

DIPLOMATIC PUDDING, 

336. Put half a pint of cream, four 
ounces of loaf sugar, and the grated rind of 
a lemon into an enamelled saucepan, and 
place it over a gentle fire ; when nearly boil- 
ing, stir in six ounces of crumbs of bread, 
one ounce of flour, three ounces of beef-suet, 
and one ounce of beef-marrow, chopped; 
stir over the fire for ten minutes ; then turn 
it into a basin to get cold. Stone and 
mince two ounces of Muscadel raisins, chop 
two ounces of candied orange-peel, wash 
and rub dry two ounces of currants and one 
ounce of sultana raisins, beat four fresh 
eggs; mix these ingredients together; add 
the sixth part of a nutmeg, grated, a wine- 
glassful of rum, and a wineglassful of orange 
water ; beat the mixture for a quarter of ail 
hour, or longer. Butter a mould, stick it 
fancifully with Muscadel raisins, put in the 
pudding, tie it closely over, and boil rapidly 
for two hours. Serve with the following 
sauce in the dish : Dissolve three ounces of 



320 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

loaf sugar in the strained juice of two sweet 
oranges ; boil till it becomes a thick syrup ; 
then add three tablespoonfuls of rum. 

THINK. Thought engenders thought. Place 
one idea upon paper another will follow it, and 
still another, until you have written a page. You 
cannot fathom your mind. There is a well of 
thought there which has no bottom. The more 
you draw from it the more clear and fruitful it will 
be. If you neglect to think yourself, and use other 
people's thoughts giving them utterance only, 
you will never know what you are capable of. At 
first your ideas may come out in lumps homely 
and shapeless ; but no matter, time and perseverance 
will arrange and refine them. Learn to think and 
you will learn to write the more you think the 
better you express your ideas. 



VERY GOOD OLD-FASHIONED BOILED 

CUSTARD, 

337. Throw into a pint and a half of 
new milk the very thin rind of a fresh 
lemon, and let it infuse for half an hour, 
then simmer them together for a few min- 
utes, and add four ounces and a half of 
white sugar. Beat thoroughly eight fresh 
eggs, mix with them another half pint of 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 321 

new milk ; stir the boiling milk quickly to 
them, take out the lemon peel, and turn the 
custard into a deep jug; set this over the 
fire in a pan of boiling water, and keep the 
custard stirred gently, but without ceasing, 
until it begins to thicken, then move the 
spoon rather more quickly, making it al- 
ways touch the bottom of the jug, until the 
mixture is brought to the point of boiling, 
when it must be instantly taken from the 
fire, or it will curdle in a moment. Pour it 
into a bowl, and keep it stirred until nearly 
cold, then add to it, by degrees, a wineglass- 
ful of good brandy, arid two ounces of 
blanched almonds, cut into spikes ; or omit 
these at pleasure. A few bitter ones bruised 
can be boiled in the milk, instead of lemon 
peel, when their flavor is preferred. 

THE ART OF SHOPPING. " What's the price of 
this article?" inquired a deaf old lady. "Seven 
shillings," said the draper. " Seventeen shillings !" 
she exclaimed; "I'll give you thirteen." "Seven 
shillings," replied the honest tradesman, "is the 
price of the article." "Oh! seven shillings," the 
lady retorted ; "I'll give you five. 11

CUSTARD WITH RICE. 

338. Boil some rice in milk, till quite 
tender, with cinnamon and a very few bit- 
ter almonds; when cold, sweeten with pow- 
dered sugar ; form a species of wall round a 
glass dish, and pour a boiled custard in the 
centre. 

GOLD is the only idol that is worshipped in all 
lands without a temple, and by all sects without 
hypocrisy. 



TO ORNAMENT CUSTARDS. 

339. Whisk, for an hour, the whites of 
two eggs, together with two tablespoonfuls 
of raspberry or red currant jelly ; lay it in 
any form upon a custard, to imitate rock, 
etc., and serve in a dish with cream round 
it. 

WHAT fashionable game are the frogs fond of? 
Croquet (croaky).

BURNT CREAM. 

340. Boil a pint of cream with some 
lemon peel ; sweeten it with white sugar to 
the taste ; beat the yolks of six eggs and 
the whites of four, mix a tablespoon ful of 
flour with some cold cream, to a very 
smooth paste, then stir it into the boiling 
cream. Take care to add the eggs when 
the cream is nearly cold. Put it over the 
fire, stirring it all the time till a custard is 
formed; then turn it out into a dish and 
strew sifted sugar over it and brown it with 
a salamander. To be eaten cold.

341. Boil some pieces of lemon peel, in 
a pint of milk. Strain it, and when cold, 
add four eggs well beaten, and sugar to the

taste. A little nutmeg and two or three 
spoonfuls of wine may be added if approved. 
Mix well, pour in cups, and be careful to 
take them out of the oven as soon as the}^ 
are thick, as, if overdone, they will contain 
whey. 



SNOW BALLS. 

342. Beat the whites of ten eggs till 
very dry, then add very gradually one 
pound of pulverized sugar, when the sugar 
is thoroughly incorporated, add two or three 
drops of essence of lemon. Have ready 
some white paper, and with a spoon drop 
the mixture in balls. Set them in a very 
moderate oven, and as soon as they are 
tinged with brown take them out. 



APPLE CREAM. 

343. Stew half a dozen tender apples, 
mash them to a pulp ; whisk the whites of 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 325 

six eggs till they are very light, and as 
soon as the apples are cold, add them to the 
eggs with five ounces of pulverized loaf 
sugar. Whisk the whole till it will stand 
up when placed on a dish. Serve it with 
sweetened cream flavored with lemon, 
vanilla, or wine. 

FREDERICK THE GREAT, in surveying one evening 
some of the advanced posts of his camp, discovered 
a soldier endeavoring to pass the sentinel. His 
majesty stopped him, and insisted on knowing 
where he was going. " To tell you the truth," 
answered the soldier; "your majesty has been so 
worsted in all your attempts, that I was going to 
desert." "Were you?" answered the monarch; 
" remain here but one week longer, and if fortune 
does not mend in that time, I'll desert with you, 
too." 



ORANGE CREAM. 

344. Take the juice of four Seville 
oranges, paring the rind of one of them ex- 
ceedingly fine. Put them into a pan w r ith 
one pint of water and eight ounces of sugar ; 
beat the whites of five eggs, set it over the 



326 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

fire, and stir it one way till it grows thick 
and white ; strain it through a gauze sieve, 
stir it till it is cold ; then beat the yolks of 
five eggs, exceedingly well, put it in your 
pan with the cream, stir it over a slow fire 
till it is ready to boil ; put it in a dish to 
cool, and stir it till it is quite cold ; then 
empty it into jelly glasses. 



FROTHED ORANGE CREAM. 

345. Make a pint of cream very sweet; 
place it on the fire and let it boil. Put the 
juice of a large orange into a small deep 
glass, having previously steeped a bit of 
orange peel in it for a short time. When 
the cream is almost cold, pour it out of a 
teapot on the orange juice, holding the tea- 
pot as high up as possible. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 327 
ORANGE CREAM FOR PUDDING, 

346. Boil two ounces of loaf sugar and 
two inches of the peel of a Seville orange 
in half a gill of water, for ten minutes; 
add the strained juice of a sweet orange, 
and a tablespoonful of rum. Boil fast for 
three minutes, then beat it into a gill of 
thick cream. It must be very smooth, and 
beaten till nearly cold. 

BOAST not of thyself, for it shall bring contempt 
upon thee. Neither deride another, for it is dan- 
gerous. 



LEMON CREAM. 

347. To one pint of water, add the 
juice of two lemons, or three if small ; the 
peel of only two. Sweeten to taste. Add 
to this, when over the fire, the whites of 
six eggs well beaten, and when this thickens 
a little, pour in the yolks, also well beaten, 
and keep stirring the cream until sufficiently 
thickened to prevent curdling. It is best to 



328 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

use an earthen pan. Fill your glasses with 
this cream, and your dessert will be de- 
licious as well as plentiful.

THE times, at present, are very hard but the 
country is generally healthy. The only complaint 
extensively prevalent, is a stricture of the chest. 



CHOCOLATE CBEAM. 

348. Scrape fine a quarter of a pound 
of the best chocolate, put to it as much 
water as will dissolve it, put it in a marble 
mortar, and beat it half an hour. Put in 
as much fine sugar as will sweeten it, and 
a pint and a half of cream ; mill it, and as 
the froth rises lay it on a sieve. Put the 
remainder of your cream in glasses, and lay 
the frothed cream upon them. 

THE name, Chocolate, is an Indian name, and is 
compounded from atte, or atle, which in the Mexi- 
can language signifies water and from the sound 
which the water wherein the chocolate is put makes, 
as choco, choco, cJwco, when it is stirred in a cup 
by an instrument called a molinet. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 329 
MOCK CREAM, 

349. Pour half a pint of boiling milk 
on a teaspoonful of arrowroot well mixed 
with a small quantity of the milk. Stir 
the mixture well; have the white of an 
egg well beaten, and when about half cold 
add it, and place the whole over a slow fire 
until it nearly boils then strain for use. 



ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE MOCK CREAM. 

350. Whisk the whites of three eggs 
with the yolk of one ; stir them in a pint 
of milk ; set it on the fire, and stir it until 
it begins to boil. Take it off, and stir it 
till it is only milk warm; strain it, and 
stand in a cold place. 

ECONOMY is the art of drawing in as much as 
one can ; but it was never intended that young 
ladies should "draw in," under the pretence of 
avoiding a waist I

WHIPPED CREAM. 

351. Sweeten with powdered sugar a 
quart of cream, and add to it a lump of 
sugar which has been rubbed upon the peels 
of two lemons or, flavor it with orange- 
flower water, or any other agreeable essence. 
Whisk the cream thoroughly in a large pan, 
and as the froth rises take it off, lay it upon 
a sieve placed over another pan, and return 
the cream which drains from the froth, till 
all is whisked then heap it upon a dish, 
or put it into glasses. Garnish with thinly- 
pared citron, cut into any fanciful shape, 
and serve. 

WE follow the world in approving others ; but 
go before it in approving ourselves. 



MILANESE CREAM. 

352. A pint of new milk and five 
ounces of loaf sugar, boiled ; three quarters 
of an ounce of isinglass, dissolved in a gill 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 331

well beaten. Add the milk to the eggs 
while hot, but not boiling. Stir over a 
gentle fire till at boiling heat ; strain into a 
basin ; stir in the isinglass and a gill of 
thick cream. Flavor with twenty-five drops 
of any kind of essence, or with three table- 
spoonfuls of Maraschino, Curacao, or rum. 
Pour the mixture into a moul(J slightly 
rubbed with the oil of sweet almonds, and 
let it stand in a cool place till firmly set. 

THE pride of emptiness is an abomination ; and 
to talk such, is the foolishness of folly. Neverthe- 
less, it is the part of wisdom to bear with patience 
their impertinence, and to pity their absurdity. 



FLOATING ISLAND. 

353. One quart of milk, and the 
whites of three eggs. Sweeten the milk 
to your taste, and to it add wine if 
you prefer it. Then whisk the whites of 
the eggs to a dry froth, and to every egg 



332 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

add one teaspoonful of currant, quince, or 
any kind of jelly you choose ; add also one 
teaspoonful of white sugar to each white. 
Pile the froth upon the milk, and serve it 
soon, as the whites w r ill fall. 

WHEN a malignant man strikes at the great 
benefactors of his race, he deserves, like the Indian 
who madly fired his arrow at the sun, to be smitten 
with the curse of blindness. 



CREAM TRIFLE, 

354. Put into a shallow dish half a 
pint of white w r ine, the peel of a lemon 
rubbed in sugar and scraped, a pint and a 
half of cream, and a quarter of a pound of 
powdered loaf sugar. Whisk the whole 
together in a dish, and take off the froth 
as it rises. Have ready a glass dish, 
in which are six sponge biscuits, twelve 
ratafias, and six macaroons steeped in wine. 
Pour a boiled custard over the biscuits, then 
cover the whole with the whisked cream.

BLANC MANGE, A-LA-FRANCAISE. 

355. Blanch one pound of sweet and 
twenty bitter almonds, drain them on a 
sieve, and afterward dry them by rubbing 
them in a napkin. Pound them in a 
mortar, moistening them from time to time 
with half a teaspoonful of water, to prevent 
their oiling. When they are pounded as 
fine as possible, take them out of the mortar 
and put them into a pan ; then with a silver 
spoon beat up the almonds gradually with 
half a pint of filtered water. After this, 
spread a napkin over an oval dish, and put 
the almonds upon it; then gather up the 
corners of the napkin, and wring it very

tight, to press out all the milk from the 
almonds. Put into this milk twelve ounces 
of crystallized sugar, broken into small 
pieces. When the sugar is dissolved, pass 
the whole through a napkin, and add to it 
one ounce of clarified isinglass, made rather 
warm. When the whole is well incorpo- 
rated, pour into the mould, which should be 
previously iced. The blanc mange will be 
ready to serve in two hours. 

CATO informs us that he never repented but of 
two things; and the one was, that he went a journey

BLANC MANGE. 

356. Have ready the following ingre- 
dients, and proceed as directed : One ounce 
of the best isinglass, five ounces of loaf 
sugar, two inches of stick vanilla, two 
inches of cinnamon, a pint of new milk, a 
gill of rich cream, ten bitter and two ounces 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 335 

of sweet almonds. Blanch the almonds and 
pound them to a paste. Add by degrees, 
while pounding, the third of a pint of cold 
water. Let it stand for two hours, then 
strain off the liquid. Put the milk, sugar, 
cinnamon, and vanilla, into an enamelled

How many lavish out their time and discourse 
in meddling with other men's matters that nothing 
concern them ! How many grossly abuse their time 
in speaking too freely of persons, when they should 
only speak of things !

a pint of cold water until it is perfectly 
dissolved ; then add the juice of a lemon,

A SLIGHT MISTAKE. Many years ago a Ham- 
burg merchant wrote to his correspondent at Lisbon 
and requested him, among other commissions, to 

21

send one or two monkeys. The letter was written 

/ 

in the Italian, in which language o signifies or. 
The o coming between the numerals 1 and 2, his 
friend read 102. He therefore sent by the first 
vessel 84 monkeys, and excused himself in his letter 
by saying that he could find no more ; but that he 
would not fail to let him have the others at the first 
opportunity. 



WAFFLES. 

361. To a pound and a half of flour, 
add a quarter of a pound of melted butter, 
two or three teaspoonfuls of good yeast, 
three eggs well beaten, and, if the yeast is 
not salt enough, add a little salt. Let it 
rise, and bake in waffle irons. Be careful 
to grease the irons thoroughly, and bake 
the cakes a rich brown. Some prefer to 
raise the batter by adding soda and sour 
milk, in that case there is no need of yeast. 

THERE are three things which a good wife should 
resemble, and yet those three things she. should not 
resemble. She should be like a town clock keep 
time and regularity. She should not be like a town 
clock speak so loud that all the town may hear 
her. She should be like a snail prudent, and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 339 

keep within her own house. She should not be like 
a snail carry all she has upon her back. She 
should be like an echo speak when spoken to. She 
should not be like an echo determined always to 
have the last word. 



QUICK WAFFLES. 

362. Make a batter of the yellow of 
three eggs, half a cup of melted butter, one 
quart of milk, and as much flour as will

the whites of the egg well beaten, and bake 
immediately. 

SYDNEY SMITH was once looking through the hot- 
house of a lady who was proud of her flowers, and 
used, not very accurately, a profusion of botanical 
names. " Madam," said he, "have you the Septen- 
nis psoriasis ?" "No," said she; "I had it last 
year, and I gave it to the Archbishop of Canter- 
bury ; it came out beautifully in the spring." Sep- 
te nnis psoriasis is the medical name for the seven 
years' itch.

WAFFLES WITHOUT YEAST. 

363. Three eggs, one pint of milk, one 
teaspoonful of butter, and as much flour

whites separately. Melt the butter, and while 
lukewarm, stir it into the milk. Whisk the 
yolks very light, add to the milk and flour 
alternately, beat it well, lastly stir in the 
whites, which must be whisked very dry. 
The batter should not be beaten after the 
whites are in. Grease your waffle irons 
after having heated them, fill them nearly 
full of the batter, close them and place 
them over the fire turn the irons so as to 
bake the waffles on both sides when done 
take it out and butter it. These must be 
baked the moment they are mixed.

portion of her time in the society of her neighbors, 
happened one day to be taken ill, and sent her hus-

ON the arrival of an emigrant ship, an Irishman 
hearing the gun fired from a battery at sunset, in- 
quired of one of the sailors what that was. " What's 
that ? Why that's sunset !" was the contemptu- 
ous reply. " Sunset," exclaimed Paddy, with dis- 
tended eyes. " Sunset ! oh, and does the sun go 
down in this country with such a clap as that ?"

FAULTS. As there are some faults that have been 
termed faults on the right side, so there are some 
errors that might be denominated errors on the safe 
side. Thus, we seldom regret having been too mild, 
too cautious, or too humble ; but we often repent 
having been too violent, too precipitate, or too 
proud 



RICE BATTER CAKES. 

373. Take a pint of boiled rice, mash

gether, it should be lukewarm but not hot, 
beat up the egg and add to it with the salt, 
then flour enough to form a batter; lastly 
the yeast. Set it to rise, and when light, 
grease your bake-iron and bake them like 
buckwheat cakes. 

GRAY HAIR. The sedentary, the studious, the 
debilitated, and the sickly, are, with very few ex- 
ceptions, those who are earliest visited with gray 
hair. The agricultural laborer, the seaman, and 
all whose employment consists of or involves ex- 
ercise in the open air, are those whose hair latest 
affords signs that the last process has commenced, 
that the fluids have begun to be absorbed, and the 
textures dried up and withered. All whose em- 
ployment renders much sitting necessary, and lit- 
tle or no exercise possible ; all who, from whatever 
cause, have least determination ; particularly if to- 
ward the head, are the persons most liable to carry 
gray heirs. It is well known that mental emotions 
and violent passions have, in a night, made the hair 
gray. These instances are in the same way to be 
understood and explained. They are owing to the 
increased determination of the blood stimulating 
the absorbents into preternatural activity, and 
causing them to take up the coloring matter of the 
hair. 



348 THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK.

solved, and a teaspoonful of tartaric acid 
dissolved in a half a cup of water. When 
the latter is ready, put in the acid and beat 
the batter well, then stir in the soda, and 
bake immediately. 

THE poorer a man is the more he pays for what 
he uses as Franklin very justly observed, necessity 
never made a good bargain. The smaller the quan- 
tity we purchase, the larger the profit charged for 
it.

OLD CHARLES MATTHEWS, in his -entertainment 
entitled "At Home," used to tell a story of pulling 
up at a roadside inn, and interrogating the waiter 
as to what he could have for dinner. " Any hot 
joint?" inquired the traveller. " N, sir, no hot 
joint, sir." "Any cold one?" "Cold one, sir? 
No, sir, no cold one, sir." " Can you broil me a 
fowl?" "Fowl, sir? No, sir, no fowl, sir." "No 
fowl, and in a country inn!" exclaimed Matthews. 
"Let me have some eggs and bacon." " Eggs and 
bacon, sir ?" said the waiter ; " no e^q-a juid bacon,

sir." 'Confound it!" at length said the hungrj 
traveller, " what have you got in the house ?" " An 
execution, sir," was the prompt response of the 
doleful waiter.

A MELANCHOLY TRUISM. In these daj^s half our 
diseases come from the neglect of our body in the 
overwork of the brain. In this railway age the 
wear and tear of labor and intellect go on without 
pause or self-pity. We live longer than our fore- 
lathers, but we suffer more than a thousand artifi- 
cial anxieties and cares. They fatigued only the 
muscles, we exhaust the finer strength of the nerves ; 
and, when we send impatiently to the doctor, it is 
ten to one but what he finds the acute complaint, 
which is all that we perceive, connected with some 
chronic mental irritation, or some unwholesome in- 
veteracy of habit. Sir Bulwer Lytton.

A YOUNG Irish servant, travelling on board a 
steamer, had the ill luck to lose the " recommenda- 
tion" which had been given her on leaving her last 
place. She brought, however, the accompanying

THE wise man feeleth his imperfections, and is 
humbled ; he laboreth in vain for his own approba- 
tion ; but the fool peepeth in the shallow stream of

most palatable, since much of it will be 
used in these straitened times. The follow- 
ing is said to be an excellent receipt. 
Scald at night half the quantity of meal 
you are going to use ; mix the other with 
cold water, having it the consistency of 
thick batter. Add a little salt, and set it 
to rise It will need no yeast. In the 
morning, the cakes will be light and crisp. 
Skimmings, where meat has been boiled, is 
best for frying them with. Fry slowly.

the batter is mixed.

COMPARATIVE NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF FOOD. 
Every hundred weight of bread contains eighty 
pounds of nutritious matter ; butcher's meat, ave- 
raging the various sorts, thirty-five ; French beans 
(in the grain), ninety-two ; broad beans, eighty- 
nine ; peas, ninety-three ; greens, eight ; turnips, 
eight ; carrots, fourteen ; and potatoes, twenty-five. 
One pound of good bread is equal to nearly three 
pounds of potatoes ; and seventj^-five pounds of 
bread and thirty pounds of meat, are equal to three 
hundred pounds of potatoes. Or, to go more into 
detail, three quarters of a pound of bread, and five 
ounces of meat, are equal to three pounds of pota- 
toes; one pound of potatoes is equal to four pounds 
of cabbage and three of turnips ; but one pound of 
rice, broad beans, or French beans, is equal to three 
pounds of potatoes. 



COMPOSITION CAKE. 

418. One pound of flour, half a pound 
of butter, half a pound of sugar, seven 
eggs, two tablespoonfuls of rosewater, half 



376 THE YOUXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

a pound of dried currants, half a pound of 
raisins, quarter of a pound of citron. Beat 
the butter and sugar together, beat the eggs 
well, and stir them into the butter and 
sugar ; then add the flour and other in- 
gredients. The currants must be washed, 
picked, dried, and then slightly floured; 
the raisins must be picked and seeded, and 
slightly floured; and the citron should be 
shaved in very thin bits. This cake should 
be baked in a slow oven, or the fruit will 
scorch. 

IT is told of the celebrated John Wilkes, that at 
some public meeting he sat next to a person, who, 
being displeased with the course matters were 
taking, kept exclaiming, " I cannot allow this to 
go on! I must take the sense -of the meeting on 
this point !" Whereupon Wilkes whispered to him, 
"Do so, if 3 r ou will; I'll take the nonsense of the 
meeting against you, and can beat you !" 



SPONGE CAKE.

USE no hurtful deceit ; think innocently and 
justly; and if you speak, speak accordingly. 



CHEAP SPONGE CAKE,

whites separate ; add to the yolks a tea- 
cupful and a half of sugar; beat them

sugar, then add the whites of the eggs, 
after they have been beaten to a froth. 
Lastly, add a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved 
in water. Flavor with a few drops of 
essence of vanilla or of lemon. Bake about 
an hour.

A CLERGYMAN who bought his sermons ready- 
written, instead of composing them himself, yet 
fondly believed his manuscripts peculiar to himself, 
was invited to preach in a church at some distance. 
Imagining that his sermon had created a sensation, 
he asked the sexton, after service, how it was liked. 
" Oh, very much indeed, sir," said the sexton, "we 
always did like that sermon !"

IT is said to have been satisfactorily demon- 
strated, that every time a wife scolds her husband, 
she adds a wrinkle to her face. It is thought the 
announcement of this fact will have a most satis- 
factory effect, especially as it is understood that 
every time a wife smiles on her husband, it will 
remove one of the old wrinkles ! 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 379 

EMPEROR'S CAKE.

and sugar, and as much flour as will form a 
dough. Roll out the dough about the eighth 
of an inch thick, cut it in cakes, and bake 
on tins in a moderate oven. 

THE first step toward wisdom, is to know that 
thou art ignorant ; and if thou wouldst not be 
esteemed foolish in the judgment of others, cast 
off the folly of being wise in thine own conceit. 



CREAM CAKE. 

423. Rub down five oimces of fresh 
butter into a pound of fine flour ; then mix 
thoroughly with them half a pound of 
sifted sugar and a few grains of salt ; add 
half a pint of thick and rather sour cream, 
mixed with two eggs well whisked, to which 
add the grated peel of an orange. Beat

ped, candied peel, or caraway seeds, may 
be added. 

SOME years ago a London chemist conceived the 
idea of collecting all the soapsuds of the metropo- 
lis, and recovering the soap that had been used 
in washing ; and could he only have organized a 
plan of collecting the suds, he would have suc- 
ceeded. An idea similar to this, has within the 
last few years been realized at Manchester, with 
the refuse of the factories. The invention has been 
patented, and an immense amount of waste tallow 
is thus recovered, which used to be washed into the 
Irish Channel, instead of returning to the purlieus 
of civilization, the wash-houses and bed-chambers, 
to wash the skins and the garments of the million. 
The Thames carries down many thousand tons of 
good soap and candles, which would be much more 
useful to society, and more grateful to the senses, 
in that domestic form and character, than in those 
they now sustain in their voyage to the ocean. 
Some years ago a patent was taken out for a mode 
of recovering a large portion of this tallow ; but it 
has not yet been carried into practical operation.

and a half of flour, a teaspoonful of grated 
nutmeg, and two tablespoonfuls of brandy. 
Put a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda into 
a half a teacup of milk. When it is entirely 
dissolved, add it, and as much more milk as 
will form a dough. Roll it out in cakes, 
cut them with a cutter or with the edge of 
a small sized tumbler, and bake them on 
tins, a light brown. 



FRENCH CAKE.

A CUTTING REBUKE. A clergyman had two 
daughters who were much too fond of dress, which 
was a great grief to him. He had often reproved 
them in vain ; and preaching one Sunday on the sin

things, pride in dress. After speaking some con- 
siderable time on this subject, he suddenly stopped

WE may arise in the morning with our hearts 
light and our spirits free, and before evening comes 
nay, in one short hour, circumstances may occur 
which shall call for the exercise of no ordinary 
share of grace ; and unless we are on our guard, 
plunge us into guilt, and shame, and distress. In 
many a dismal story of private life we find that the 
sin which threw its chill withering shade, over all 
succeeding years from which there was no refuge 
but through the darkness of the grave was com- 
mitted without premeditation, without design, sim- 
ply by being ''off one's guard." It is possible one 
hour to shudder at the thought of sin, and before 
that hour has passed away, to be the thing you 
shudder at.

gradually, only a small spoonful at a time, 
then stir in the almonds. Roll the paste

mixture into small balls, place them on a 
buttered tin, and bake them in a very 
gentle oven, about twenty minutes. Move

and store them in a very dry canister as 
soon as they are cold.

A LADY, after performing, with the most brilliant 
execution, a sonato on the pianoforte, in the presence 
of Dr. Johnson, turning to the philosopher, took the 
liberty of asking him if he was fond of music. " ISo, 
madam," replied the doctor; "but of all noises, I 
think music is the least disagreeable."

eggs beaten light, and three quarters of a 
pound of sugar. Mix all w r ell together, and

GRACIOUS hearts reflect most upon themselves ; 
they do not seek so much what to reprove in others, 
as what to amend in themselves ; they love to look 
inward and being sensible of their own failings, 
are tender in reflecting on the weaknesses of others. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 395 

Whereas, those who are most prying into the lives 
of others, are most careless in reforming their own.

batter and sugar together, whisk the eggs, 
and add them, then stir in the flour and but- 
termilk. Add the fruit last. Bake slowly, 
as the fruit will not admit of a hot oven. 

A GENTLEMAN having occasion to call upon an 
author, found him at home in his study. He re- 
marked the great heat of the apartment, and said,

and other ingredients, to be worked in 
afterward. 

IT is not what we earn, but what we save, that 
makes us rich. It is not what we eat, but what we 
diyext, that makes us strong. It is not what we 
read, but what we remember, that makes us learned. 
All this is very simple, but it is worth recollecting.

AFTER telling several amusing anecdotes, Mrs. 
Piozzi mentioned one of Sir Richard Jebb. One 
day somebody had given him a bottle of castor oil, 
very pure. It had but lately been brought into 
use. Before he left his home he gave it in charge 
to his man, telling him to be careful of it. After a 

' zj 

lapse of a considerable time, Sir Richard asked his 
servant for the oil. " Oh, it is all used," replied he. 
" Used !" said Sir Richard, " how, and when, sir ?" 
" I put it in the castor, when wanted, and gave it 
to the company !"

" AH, Mr. Simpkins, we have not chairs enough 
for our company," said an extravagant wife to a 
frugal husband. " Plenty of chairs, ducky, but a 
little too much company," replied Mr. Simpkins, with 
a knowing wink.

teaspoonful of carbonate of soda dissolved in 
it ; knead to a dough ; roll out the third of 
an inch thick, and line a long plain cake 
tin ; press the corners, that the crust may 
be of equal thickness all over ; put in the 
fruit, press it down closely ; cover over with 
dough ; notch the edge round with a knife, 
and bake in a slow oven for nearly three 
hours. When cold, turn it out of the tin. 

JAMES I. of England and VI. of Scotland was a 
waverer. He was aware of this defect, and heard 
of a preacher singularly happy in his choice of texts. 
James appointed him to preach before him, that he 
might put his abilities to the test. The preacher, 
with the utmost gravity, gave out the text in the 
following words : James the first and sixth, in the 
latter part of the verse : "He that wavereth is like 
a wave of the sea, driven by winds, and tossed." 
" He is at me already," said the King.

half of sugar, and mix with a cup of sour 
milk, in which a teaspoonful of soda has 
been dissolved. To this add one egg well 
beaten. Bake in a mould or dish. It may 
be eaten hot, as a pudding, with sauce, or 
when cold, as cake. In the latter case use 
two eggs instead of one. 

A TEST OF COURAGE. Henry IV. of France, read- 
ing an ostentatious inscription on the monument of 
a Spanish officer, " Here lies the body of Don, etc., 
etc., who never knew what fear was." "Then," 
said the king, " he never snuffed a candle with his 
fingers." 



RAILROAD CAKE. 

458. One cup of sugar, one cup of flour, 
three eggs, one teaspoonful of soda, and two

dissolve the soda in water or milk. 

THE son of a small shopkeeper having put some 
candles in a cellar one day, his father told him he 



THE YOUXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 405 

thought it was too damp a place for them, and that 
they would be likely to mould, " Likely to mould !" 
replied the lad ; " if that is the case, we had better 
put all our dips there, and perhaps they will turn 
to mould candles." 



CRULLERS. 

459. Four eggs, half a pound of sugar,

flour as possible, cut the dough in strips, 
twist them, and boil them in lard. 

A RETIRED cheesemonger, who hated any allusion 
to the business that had enriched him, said to 
Charles Lamb, in the course of a discussion on the 
Poor Laws "You must bear in mind, sir, that I 
have got rid of that sort of stuff which you poets 
call "milk of human kindness!" Lamb looked at 
him steadily, and gave acquiescence in these pithy 
words, " Yes, I am aware of that you turned it all 
into cheese several years ago /"

PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

CURRANT JELLY, No. 1. 

464. Squeeze the juice out of the 
currants, which must have been picked oil 
a dry day. Measure the juice, and to every 
pint weigh out a pound of sugar. Boil the 
juice twenty minutes, and skim it; then 
add the sugar, and fill your glasses. When 
cold, it will prove a fine jelly. 

THE best cure for low spirits is business. One 
half of the melancholy that you run against is 
caused by indolence. The best fun in the world is 
activity. 



CURRANT JELLY, No, 2. 

465. Mash your fruit with a wooden 
spoon, and squeeze the juice through your 
jelly bag. To every pint of juice allow a 
pound of white sugar. When the sugar is 
dissolved, add a piece of isinglass, dissolved 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 40P 

in warm water, to clarify the jelly. A 
quarter of an ounce of isinglass to five pints 
of juice, will be sufficient. Boil and skim 
it till a jelly is formed; then take it off 
the fire, and put it in glasses while warm. 
The next day put brandy paper over them, 
and paste them. Black currant jelly is 
made in the same way, only it requires 
but three quarters of a pound of sugar to 
a pint of juice. 



ORANGE JELLY. 

466. Squeeze the juice from the 
oranges, and to every pint of the juice 
add a pound of sugar and a quarter of an 
ounce of dissolved isinglass. The Eussian 
isinglass is the kind to use for this purpose. 
Boil and skim it till a jelly is formed, 
which you may tell by letting a drop fall in 
a glass of cold water and if it falls to the 
bottom in a mass, the jelly is done. Or, 



410 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

take a little out in a spoon, and expose it 
to the cool air for a few minutes. 

SEE'ST thou not that the angry man loseth his 
understanding ? Whilst thou art yet in thy senses, 
let the wrath of another be a lesson to thyself. 



GRAPES PRESERVED IN VINEGAR. 

467. Grapes are preserved in vinegar 
by the Persians after the following fashion. 
The grapes are gathered when half ripe, 
and put into bottles half filled with vinegar, 
which so macerates them, that they lose 
their hardness, and yet do not become too 
soft. The grapes have a sweet acid taste, 
which is not unpalatable, and especially 
refreshing during the great heats. 



CALVES' FEET FOR JELLIES. 

468. Always select those feet which 
have been dressed with the skins on they 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 411 

will make a larger quantity of jelly, and 
better in quality, than those which have 
been skinned. Before cooking, the feet 
should be thoroughly scraped, washed, and 
soaked for an hour or two. 



A LADY thought it would look interesting to faint 
away at a party the other evening. One of the 
company began bathing her temples and head with 
rum, when the lady exclaimed, " For goodness' sake 
put nothing on that will change the color of my 
hair!" 



ARROWROOT JELLY. 

469. Mix two tablespoonfuls of arrow- 
root with half a pint of water. Have ready 
half a pint of boiling water in which some 
lemon peel has been boiled. Take out the 
lemon, pour the dissolved arrowroot into 
the boiling water, add sufficient sugar to 
sweeten it, and nutmeg to the taste. Boil 
the whole about five minutes, and pour it 
in a mould or dish to get cold. It may be 
flavored with wine instead of the lemon. 



412 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

470. Peel the pears, and if they are 
large, cut each one in four pieces, and take 
out the core. To a pound of fruit, weigh a 
pound of sugar; dissolve the sugar with 
just enough water to wet it; add a quarter 
of an ounce of isinglass, dissolved in warm 
water, to five pounds of sugar. When the 
sugar is dissolved, make the syrup, and cook 
the fruit until it is clear. 



PRESERVED GREEN GAGES. 

471. Prepare the fruit by pricking each 
one with a needle, to prevent them from 
bursting. Leave a portion of the stem on 
each, as it gives small fruits a handsome 
appearance on the table. Make a syrup 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, 
and a gill of water to a pound of sugar. 
Add a quarter of an ounce of isinglass, 
dissolved in warm water, to every six 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 413 

pounds of sugar. When the sugar is dis- 
solved, put it with the dissolved isinglass 
over the fire, boil, and skim it then pour 
it out of the kettle. Wash the kettle, put 
the syrup back again, put in the fruit, and 
boil it till, by holding one toward the light, 
it looks clear. Take the gages cJit one at 
a time, strain the syrup, put the fruit in 
jars, and pour the syrup over warm. Paste 
them up the next day. 



PEACH MARMALADE. 

472. Pare and cut up the peaches in 
small pieces, and to a pound of fruit add a 
pound of sugar. When the sugar is dis- 
solved, set it over the fire, and let it boil 
till it is smooth paste. Stir it all the time 
it is boiling. Put it in the jars while warm, 
and paste them over the next day. 



414 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

473. Take equal weights of fruit and 
moist sugar, and put on the fire together. 
Keep stirring and breaking the fruit till the 
sugar melts, then boil till it will jelly on a 
plate. Though simple, this will be found a 
very good receipt. Or, take equal weight 
of fruit and roughly-pounded loaf sugar; 
bruise the fruit with the back of a spoon, 
and boil them together for half an hour. 
If a little more juice is wanted, add the 
juice of currants, drawn as for jelly. 

CONSUMPTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE. A 
human being (English) is supposed to consume 
annually the produce of rather more than three 
and one eighth acres of land half an acre of 
bread ; one eighth for beer, cider, etc. ; one fiftieth 
for vegetables ; two and a half for animal food. 



PINE-APPLE MARMALADE. 

474. Pare the rind, and cut into small 
pieces ; the same weight of sugar as fruit ; 
put one third of the sugar to the fruit. Let 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 415 

it stand all night, so as to extract the juice. 
Boil it on the following day for a short 
time ; let it stand for two or three days ; 
then repeat the boiling, with another third 
of the sugar. Let it stand again another 
day or two, then boil it clear with the re- 
mainder of the sugar. The juice of a 
lemon, if added, gives to the marmalade an 
agreeable acid. 



BRANDY PEACHES. 

475. Select the white cling-stones, 
known by the name of the " Heath peach." 
Make a hot ley of ashes and water, put in a 
few peaches at a time, and let them remain 
about a minute and a half, or until the skin 
will rub off with your finger. Take them 
out, and throw them in a vessel of cold water. 
When all are done in this manner, rub off 
the skins with a cloth, and throw them into 
another vessel of cold water. Make a syrup 
of half a pound of sugar to a pound of 



416 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

fruit- -prepare it in the same manner as for 
preserves. Put in your peaches, and let 
them boil until they are sufficiently tender 
to be easily pierced with a straw. Take 
them out, and add to each pint of syrup a 
quart of the very best white brandy. When 
the fruit is cool, put it into your jars, and 
leave plenty of room to fill them with the 
syrup as, if packed too closely, they lose 
their shape. 



APRICOTS IN BRANDY, 

4-76. Put apricots, whole, into a jar 
that has a close cover; add to them one 
fourth their weight of sugar, and brandy 
sufficient to cover them. Lay a piece of 
thick paper over the fruit in the jar; set 
the jar in a saucepan of cold water; put it 
over the fire, and when the brandy becomes 
hot, remove the jar. As soon as it is quite 
cool, cork, and seal securely. Do not let 
the brandy remain on the fire after it is hot. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 417 
PRESERVED PEACHES. 

477. Choose the white cling-stones, 
known by the name of the " Heath peach." 
Insert the knife at the stem and cut them 
longitudinally through to the stone. Wring 
out the stones, by placing one hand on each 
half of the peach, and suddenly giving each 
a turn in opposite directions ; the fruit will 
break in half, leaving the stone attached to 
one side. With a pointed knife it may 
easily be extracted. After the peaches have 
all been prepared in this manner, pare and 
weigh them. Then weigh a pound of sugar 
for each pound of fruit. Put the sugar into 
a preserving kettle, and allow a gill of water 
to each pound of sugar. Let the sugar 
stand until it is perfectly dissolved before it 
is put on the fire ; to ten pounds of sugar 
add the half of the white of an egg, well 
beaten, or a piece of Russian isinglass, about 
an inch square, dissolved in two tablespoon- 
fuls of water. Set the kettle over the fire, 

26 



418 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

and as soon as the syrup begins to boil, 
skim it. When the scum has ceased to rise, 
take the syrup off the fire, pour it into a 
pan, and wash the kettle, in order to pre- 
vent the scum, which adheres to the sides, 
from boiling into the fruit. Now pour the 
syrup back into the kettle, add the fruit to 
it, and place it over a brisk fire, let the fruit 
boil fast for about an hour and a quarter, or 
until it appears translucent when held on a 
fork toward the light. Then take your 
peaches out very carefully, a piece at a time, 
and place them on dishes. Put the syrup 
in pans until it is lukewarm. Then put the 
fruit in jars, and pour the syrup over it. 



STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

478. Stem the strawberries, put them 
in a pan, and with a wooden spoon or 
potato masher, rub them fine. Put a 
sieve over a pan, and inside of the sieve, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 419 

spread a piece of thin muslin ; strain the 
juice through this, and to a pint add one 
pound of sugar, with a quarter of an ounce 
of isinglass dissolved, in water to every five 
pounds of sugar. When the sugar is dis- 
solved, set the kettle over the fire and boil it 
till it is to a jelly. Pour it into glasses 
while it is warm, and paste them when 
cold. 

A GENTLEMAN having in his garden a superabun- 
dance of peaches that were over ripe, gave a quan- 
tity of them to some Irish laborers. On asking one 
of the men how he liked the fruit, he said they were 
very good, but the seeds scratched his throat. 



RASPBERRY JELLY. 

479. Dissolve one ounce of gelatine in 
half a pint of water, add three quarters of a 
pint of raspberry syrup (with a spoonful of 
lemon juice, or fifteen grains of tartaric 
acid), boil and skim, and pour it into the 
mould. 



420 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

\ ; i PUNCH JELLY. 

480. Take a pound of loaf sugar, one 
ounce and a half of isinglass, the juice 
of four Seville oranges four lemons, a 
wineglassful of brandy, and one of rum. 
Melt the isinglass in a pint or more of boil- 
ing water, then strain it quite hot through a 
fine sieve upon the punch. Stir it, and put 
it in a mould. 

GOOD temper is like a sunny clay, it sheds a 
brightness over every thing ; it is the sweetener of 
toil, and the soother of disquietude. 



CALF'S FEET JELLY. 

481. Put a set of calf's feet, well cleaned, 
into a pan with five quarts of water, and let 
them boil gently till reduced to two quarts. 
Then take out the feet, let the jelly become 
quite cold, skim the fat off clean, and clear 
the jelly from the sediment. Beat the 
whites of eight eggs to a froth, then add one 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 421 

bottle of raisin wine or sherry, squeeze in 
the juice of from eight to twelve lemons, 
and the peel of five or six. Sweeten it to 
the taste (about two pounds and a quarter 
of loaf sugar). When the stock is boiling, 
take three spoonfuls of it, and keep stirring 
it with the wine and eggs, to prevent it 
from curdling ; then add a little more stock 
and still keep stirring, and then put it into 
the pan; let it boil twenty minutes, and 
about the middle of the time pour in half a 
teacup of cold water ; pour it into a flannel 
bag, and let it run into a basin. Keep 
pouring it back into the bag ge/itly till it 
runs clear. Let it settle a little, after boil- 
ing, before pouring it into the bag, and be 
nearly cold before going into the mould. 
The eggs and wine must be carefully mixed, 
or it will curdle. If loosening the edges 
and shaking the jellies or blancmange is not 
sufficient, try dipping the mould for one 
instant into very hot water, or lay under 
it a cloth that has been dipped in hot water. 



422 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

JELLY WITH GELATINE. 

4-82. Take two ounces and three quar- 
ters of gelatine, dissolved in about a quart 
of water, four lemons, one pound of loaf 
sugar, nearly half a bottle of raisin wine, or 
a little brandy and less of the wine, as little 
white of egg is necessary to clear it, as 
the egg takes from the stiffness of the jelly. 
Boil altogether, strain through a jelly bag, 
and put into a mould. 



APPLE JELLY. 

483. Quarter a peck of codlings, put 
them into a preserving-pan with the peel 
of a lemon, a small piece of cinnamon, and 
six cloves; add as much spring water as 
will just cover them. Boil the whole to a 
pulp, then run them through a jelly-bag, 
and to every pint of juice, put three-quarters 
of a pound of good loaf-sugar ; boil it fast 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 423 

until it jellies; then pour it into pots or 
moulds. August is the best time to make 
this jelly, when the codlings are full grown, 
but not ripe. Crabs greatly improve this 
jelly, and when they are not to be had, a 
little lemon juice. 

Jelly may be made of any kind of fruit 
by putting the fruit into a preserving-pan 
with its own weight of sugar, boiling and 
skimming it until it will jelly; then pour 
the whole through a jelly-bag, but do not 
press it ; take what remains in the bag, and 
boil it a quarter of an hour for jam, and put 
the juice into another stew-pan, and boil 
the same time. This method saves the 
trouble of pressing, and prevents waste. 



MARMALADE JELLY. 

4-84. To every pound of Seville oranges, 
put three pints of water, cut the oranges 
into quarters, keeping out all the seeds; 



424 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

separate the rind first, and steep it in water 
twenty-four hours, or even longer, to take 
off the bitter; then boil the peel slowly 
with the oranges, till it is tender; run all 
through a jelly-bag, and to every pint add 
one pound of loaf sugar, then boil it at 
least half an hour. A lemon or two, cut up 
with the oranges, is an improvement. The 
peel requires to be boiled some hours. 

"MAMMA," said a little fellow, whose mother had 
forbade him to draw horses and ships on the 
mahogany sideboard with a sharp nail, " mamma, 
this ain't a nice house. At Sam Rackett's we can 
cut the sofa, and pull out the hair, and ride the 
shovel and tongs over the carpet ; but here we can't 
have any fun at all 1" 



TO PRESERVE WHOLE OR HALF QUINCES. 

485. Into two quarts of boiling water, 
put a quantity of the fairest golden pippins, 
in slices not very thin, and not pared, but 
wiped clean. Boil them very quickly, 
close covered, till the water becomes a thick 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 425 

jelly; then scald the quinces. To every 
pint of pippin jelly, put one pound of the 
finest sugar ; boil it, and skim it clear. Put 
those quinces that are to be done, whole 
into the syrup at once, and let it boil very 
fast; and those that are to be in halves by 
themselves ; skim it, and when the fruit is 
clear, put some of the syrup into a glass to 
try whether it jellies, before taking it off 
the fire. The quantity of quinces is to be 
one pound, to one pound of sugar, and one 
pound of jelly, already boiled with the 
sugar. 



TO KEEP ORANGES OR LEMONS FOE PASTRY. 

486. When you have squeezed the 
juice, throw the peels into salt and water; 
let them remain a fortnight ; clean out the 
pulp ; boil them till tender, strain them, and 
when they are tolerably dry, boil a small 
quantity of syrup of common loaf sugar and 



426 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

water, and put over them; in a week boil 
them gently in it, till they look clear. 

A cow consumes on an average one hundred 
pounds of green food in twentj^-four hours. This, 
for one hundred and eighty-five days of summer, is 
eighteen thousand five hundred pounds. In winter, 
forty-five pounds of roots a day ; or for one hundred 
and eighty days, eighty-one hundred pounds. One- 
third of this may be potatoes ; the rest, other roots. 
But she gives, if well fed, two thousand quarts of 
milk a year. 



TO PRESERVE PEARS. 

487. Pare them very thin, and simmer 
in a thin syrup ; let them lie a day or two. 
Make the syrup richer, and simmer again, 
and repeat this till they are clear; then 
drain and dry them in the sun or a cool 
oven, a very little time. They may be 
kept in syrup, and dried as wanted, which 
makes them more moist and rich. Jargo- 
nelles are the best for this purpose. 

A YOUNG lady, after dancing all night, and several 
hours longer, will generally find, on consulting the 
looking-glass, that the evening''*} amusement will not 
bear the morning's reflection. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 427 
TO PRESERVE A MELON. 

488. Scrape off the thin outside skin, 
make a hole in the top, take out the seeds ; 
then throw the melon into water, and after 
it has remained twelve hours, take it out 
and put it into a preserving-pan, with a 
large piece of loaf-sugar, and as much water 
as will cover it ; then cover the pan closely, 
and let it remain for an hour, on a very 
slow fire. Repeat this process three times, 
on three successive days, taking care not to 
allow it to boil ; make a thin syrup, drain 
the melon carefully out of the liquor, and 
put it into the syrup, set it over a slow fire, 
closely covered, for half an hour every day 
for three ensuing days, on the last day boil- 
ing the syrup until it is very rich, with the 
rind of one, and the juice of two lemons. 
To improve the flavor of a melon, take it 
when nearly ripe, cut out so much of the 
large end, as to permit the scooping out of 
the seeds; then fill up the hollow with 
water and sugar, or white wine j close the 



428 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

top, put the melon in a net exposed to the 
sun, for as many days as it remains good. 
A water melon will thus acquire a fine 
flavor ; but a musk melon requires no im- 
provement. 

SINK not beneath reverses. Play the game of 
life boldly. Here, at least, you may sometimes 
copy the gambler, who doubles his stakes as fast 
as he loses. 



TO PRESERVE NECTARINES, 

489. Split the fruit, take out the stones, 
and put the nectarines into clarified sugar 
till they take it well. Skini the liquor, 
cover the nectarines with paper, and set 
them by until the next day. Add sugar to 
the syrup, boiling it until it will flow ; put in 
the nectarines, give them a good boil, skim, 
cover them, and lay them on a stove. The 
next day take them out of the sugar, drain 
them, place them separately, dusting sugar 
over them ; the next day put them on the 
stove, or into a cool oven to dry. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 429 

PICKLES, SAUCES, ETC. 

PICCALILLI, OH INDIAN PICKLE. 
490. Take white cabbage quartered, 
cauliflowers, cucumbers, melons, apples, 
French beans, plums ; all, or any of these ; 
lay them on a hair sieve, strew over a large 
handful of salt; set them in the sun for 
three or four days, or till very dry ; put 
them into a stone jar with the following 
pickle : Put a pound of ginger into salt and 
water, the next day scrape and slice it, salt 
it and dry it in the sun, put into a gallon 
of vinegar, with two ounces of pepper, half 
an ounce of turmeric, a quarter of a pound 
of mustard seed, bruised ; stop the pickle 
close, then prepare the cabbage, etc. If the 
fruit is put in, it must be green. The jar need 
never be emptied, but put in the things as 
they come into season, adding fresh vinegar. 

THOSE people who turn up their noses at the 
world, mi^ht do well to reflect that it is as good a 

^7 

world as they were ever in, and a much better one 
than they are likely ever to get into again. 



430 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 

491. Choose small white onions, peel 
them, and throw a few at a time in a pan 
of boiling salt and water ; as soon as they 
look clear, take them out carefully, and 
place them on a sieve to dry, then put in 
more, and so on till all are cooked; when 
they are cold, put them in jars, and pour 
spiced vinegar over them. To each quart 
of the vinegar, put one tablespoonful of 
whole allspice, half a tablespoonful of pep- 
per grains, three or four small pieces of 
mace, half a dozen cloves, and a tablespoon- 
ful of mustard seed ; boil all these spices in 
the vinegar, and pour it, boiling hot, over 
the pickles. 

ORIENTAL JUSTICE. A person having a bag of coin 
stolen from his house, complained to the Cadi, who 
ordered all the people of the house before him. Giv- 
ing each a piece of stick, all of equal lengths, he 
said, "whoever is the thief, his stick will be a fin- 
ger's breadth longer than the rest." The thief, 
alarmed, cut a finger's breadth off his stick ; and 
next day, when they were summoned by the Cadi 
to produce their sticks, he was thus detected. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 431 

PICKLED RED CABBAGE. 

492. Choose two middling-sized, well 
colored, and firm cabbages, shred them very 
finely, first pulling off the outside leaves; 
mix with them half a pound of salt, tie 
them up in a thin cloth, and let them hang 
for twelve hours, then boil a quart of vine- 
gar, with an ounce of ginger, half an ounce 
of black pepper, and a quarter of an ounce 
of cloves. Put the cabbage into jars, and 
pour the vinegar over it when cold. 

THE bright fire is the eye of the home ; it bespeaks 
cheerfulness, peace, cleanliness, comfort, about it 
the sweet courtesies of life, in which there is no 
parade nor affectation, which manifest themselves 
in kind words and affectionate looks cluster natu- 
rally and gracefully. 



CHOW CHOW. 

493. Three cabbages, twenty-five pep- 
pers, half a pint of mustard seed, three 
sticks of horseradish, chipped. Cut the cab- 
bages as for slaw ; chop the peppers very 



432 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

fine. Put in a jar, a layer of cabbage, a 
very little salt, then a layer of peppers, 
sprinkle over this some horseradish and 
mustard seed, and so on, till all is in, then 
fill up the jars with cold vinegar, in every 
quart of which dissolve two ounces of sugar. 
This is very good, with hot or cold meat. 

GEORGE I., on a journey to Hanover, stopped at a 
village in Holland, and while the horses were vet- 

O '-' 

ting ready, he asked for two or three eggs, which 
were brought him, and charged two hundred florins. 
"How is this ?" said his majesty, "eggs must be 
very scarce in the place." " Pardon me," said the 
host, " eggs are plenty enough, but kings are 
scarce." The king smiled and ordered the money 
to be paid. 



PICKLED TOMATOES. 

494. Take one peck of ripe tomatoes, 
prick them with a large needle, and lay 
them in strong salt and water eight days. 
Then take them out of the brine, and lay 
them in vinegar and water, for twenty-four 
hours. Scald a dozen small onions in vine- 
gar, and stand the whole away to get cold. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 438 

Drain the tomatoes, and add them to the 
cold onions and vinegar, with two wine- 
glasses of mustard seed, and an ounce of 
cloves. 

FORCE OF HABIT. Sir Walter Scott says : " There 
was a boy in my class at school, who stood always 
at the top ; nor could I with all my efforts supplant 
him. Day passed after day, and still he kept his 
place, do what I would. At length I observed that 
when a question was asked him, he alwaj^s fumbled 
with his fingers at a particular button in the lower 
part of his waistcoat. To remove that button, there- 
fore, became expedient in my eye ; and in an evil 
moment, it was cut off. Great was my anxiet}' to 
know the success of my measure ; and it succeeded 
only too well. When the bo}^ was again questioned, 
his fingers sought again for the button, but it was 
not to be found. In his distress he looked down for 
it ; it was to be seen no more than to be felt. He 
stood confounded, and I "took him. down." 



TOMATO CATSUP, No. 1. 

495. Cut the fruit in half, and boil it 
half an hour; squeeze out the juice and 
strain it through a hair sieve or coarse cloth, 
and add the spices in the proportion given 
below. Let the whole boil three hours, 

27 



434 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

over a slow fire. Pour it out, and let it 
stand till the next day, when you must add 
half a pint of vinegar for each peck of to- 
matoes. 

For each peck of tomatoes, one eighth of 
an ounce of red pepper, one quarter ounce 
of black, half ounce of mace, half ounce all- 
spice, half ounce cloves, two ounces mustard, 
all finely powdered. Salt to suit the taste. 

" WHY is it, dear, that whenever we send for a 
pound of tea or coffee, the grocer always sends it an 
ounce short ?" " Oh, my dear, it's only a, peculiar 
weigh he has I" 



TOMATO CATSUP, No. 2. 

496. Slice the tomatoes, put a layer in 
a deep vessel, and sprinkle over some salt ; 
then another layer of tomatoes, and salt till 
all are in. Stand them in the sun for two 
or three days, when they are soft, pass 
them through a sieve, and put the pulp, 
thus drained out, over the fire to boil. Add 
Cayenne pepper, whole black pepper, mace, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 435 

cloves, allspice, and a little race ginger, if 
you like ; let it boil till it is thick, add a 
clove of garlic; by tasting it, you can judge 
if it is seasoned to your taste. When cold, 
bottle it off; put a tablespoonful of sweet oil 
on the top of each bottle, and seal the corks. 

A MATTER OP TASTE. There is a charming tit-bit 
in the quaint history of " Hop o' my Thumb," which 
is not to be matched in literature of higher preten- 
sions. During the parley with the Ogre's wife, the 
hero says, as spokesman for his brother, " If you do 
not give us a night's lodging, it is quite certain that 
the wolves in the forest will devour us, and sooner 
than that, we would prefer to be eaten by the gentle- 
man of the house." 



PEPPER SAUCE, 

497. Cut some green peppers very fine 
with double the quantity of cabbage, to a 
quart of the cut cabbage, and peppers, add 
a stick of horseradish grated, a tablespoon- 
ful of mustard seed, a tablespoonful of whole 
allspice, a dozen cloves, a couple of sprigs of 
mace, a tablespoonful of salt, and two of 



436 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

sugar. Boil the spices and sugar, in three 
pints of good vinegar, and while hot, pour 
it over the peppers and cabbage. When 
cold, cover the jars, and keep in a cool, dry 
place. 



HORSERADISH SAUCE, No. 1. 

498. Grate a stick of horseradish. To 
one gill of vinegar, add a small tablespoon- 
ful of mustard, and the same of sugar, with 
a little salt. Mix them well together, and 
stir into the horseradish. 



HORSERADISH SAUCE, No. 2. 

499. Grate a stick of horseradish, add 
to it as much vinegar as will cover it, a lit- 
tle salt, and a teaspoonful of sugar. 



THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 437 

VEGETABLE SAUCE, No, 1. 

500. Slice half a dozen large tomatoes, 
put them into a stew-pan, with about a pint 
of button mushrooms, and an onion minced 
fine. Season with Cayenne pepper and salt. 
Thicken with a piece of butter, rolled in 
flour. Stew very slowly. When the vege- 
tables are tender serve it. This sauce is 
good with cold meat. 



VEGETABLE SATTCE, No, 2. 

501. Peel a quart of mushrooms, put 
them into a stew-pan with the water which 
adheres to them. Season with salt and pep- 
per, stew them slowly, and when nearly 
done, add a piece of butter rolled in flour. 



POTATO SAUCE. 



502. Boil some potatoes till tender. 
Boil equal quantities of onions in another 



438 TIIE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

pot, when the latter are soft, drain them 
through a colander, mash them fine, season 
highly with pepper and salt. Add also a 
piece of butter. Then cut the potatoes in 
pieces about an inch square, add them to 
the onions, mix them well together; put 

them over the fire again a few minutes, to 

<-j j 

get hot, and pour in enough vinegar to 
flavor. Dish it up immediately, and serve 
hot. This sauce is an accompaniment to 
any kind of cold roast meat or poultry. 



TOMATO SAUCE. 

503. Peel some tomatoes and cut them 
in slices. Make a dressing of a tablespoon- 
ful of sweet oil, the same of vinegar, half a 
teaspoonful of mixed mustard, cayenne pep- 
per, and salt to the taste. Mix this dress- 
ing with the tomatoes and serve them. 
This is a good sauce for cold roast beef. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 439 
ONION SAUCE. 

504. Peel some white onions, and boil 
them in milk and water, without salt. 
When soft, mash them, season them with 
pepper and salt, and add a piece of butter. 



MINT SAUCE. 

505. Pick and wash some spear mint, 
chop it fine, and pour on enough vinegar to 
wet it. To each gill of vinegar, add a 
quarter of a pound of sugar. Mix it well. 



CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

506. Pick and wash the cranberries, 
and allow three quarters of a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit. Put them in a pre- 
serving kettle with very little water. Stew 
them till they are soft, and pour them into 



440 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

moulds. Rinse the moulds in cold water to 
prevent them from sticking. 

THE good are better made by ill, 
As odors crushed are sweeter still. 



APPLE SAUCE, 

507. Pare and slice some apples, put 
them in a stewpan with very little water, 
cover them to keep in the steam. When 
soft, mash them, and add sugar to the taste. 
Ripe quinces make a good sauce prepared in 
the same way as directed for apples. Or, 
apples and quinces may be mixed in equal 
proportions. 



DRIED APPLE SAUCE. 

508. Wash some dried apples, and pour 
over them enough hot water to cover them. 
Let them stand all night. In the morning 



THE TOUXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 441 

put the apples and the water they were 
soaked in, into a kettle, and if there is not 
enough water to cook them, add some more. 
When quite soft, mash them. They are 
greatly improved by stewing some slices of 
lemon peel with them. They may be sea- 
soned with cinnamon or nutmeg. Sweeten 
to the taste. 



DRIED PEACH SAUCE. 

509. They are prepared in the same 
manner as dried apples. 



WINE SAUCE. 

510. Mix together two ounces of butter 
and a tablespoonful of flour ; stir this into 
a half pint of boiling water, to which add 
enough sugar to make it quite sweet. Let 
it boil a few minutes, then add gradually 
the white of one egg beaten to a froth, and 



442 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

a gill of Madeira wine. Grate nutmeg over 
it, and serve it while hot. 



WHITE SAUCE FOR FISH. 

511. Boil a gill of new milk, beat the 
yolk of a fresh egg with half a gill of thick 
fresh cream. Add the milk slowly ; mix in 
by degrees the strained juice of a lemon. 
, Stir over a slow fire till the sauce thickens ; 
then serve it at once. 

GOOD beef is easily distinguished by a practiced 
eye. It is of fine, smooth, open grain ; the color of 
the fat should be white, and the lean a bright red. 
If the color be dark and of a brick dust hue, and the 
fat hard and skinny, it will certainly be tough, and 
unwholesome, and dear at any price. 



LIVER SAUCE. 



512. Boil the livers of fowls a few min- 
utes in water ; rub them fine with part of 
the water in which they have been boiled ; 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 443 

season with pepper, salt, and some butter 
rolled in flour. As soon as the sauce comes 
to the boil, remove it from the fire. This 
sauce is good with cold roasted fowl or 
turkey. Serve it in a sauce tureen while 
hot. 

A PARTY, taking supper at a country tavern, found 
the poultry rather tough. One of the guests, after 
exercising his ingenuity to no effect in trying to 
dissect an old fowl, turned to the waiter and asked, 
" Have you such a thing as a powder flask ?" " No, 
sir, we have not, do you want one?" " Why, yes, I 
think the shortest way would be to blow this fellow 
up /" 



PICKLED CHERRIES. 

513. Pick over your cherries, remove 
all the specked ones. Put them into a jar, 
and pour over them as much hot vinegar 
and sugar as will cover them ; to each gallon 
of vinegar allow four pounds of sugar. Boil 
and skim it, and pour it hot over the fruit. 
Let it stand a week, then pour off the vine- 
gar and boil it as before, pour it hot over 



444 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

the cherries the second time. As soon as 
they are cold tie them closely. 



MANGOES. 

514. Although any melon may be used 
before it is quite ripe, yet there is a particu- 
lar sort for this purpose, which the garden- 
ers know, and should be mangoed soon after 
they are gathered. Cut a small piece out 
of one end, through that take out the seeds, 
and mix with them mustard-seed and shred 
garlic ; stuff the melon as full as the space 
will allow, and replace the cut piece. Bind 
it up with pack-thread. To allow for 
wasting, boil a good quantity of vinegar, 
with pepper, salt, ginger, and any of the 
sweet spices ; then pour it boiling hot over 
the mangoes for four successive days; and 
on the last, put flour of mustard and scraped 
horseradish into the vinegar, just as it boils 
up. Stop close. Observe that there be 
plenty of vinegar, as pickles are spoiled if 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 445 

not well covered. Large cucumbers, called 
" green turley," prepared in the same way, 
are excellent, and are sooner fit to be eaten. 



TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWERS. 

515. Cut them before they are too 
much blown, and upon a dry day ; strip off 
the leaves, and quarter the stalk; scald 
them in salt and water, but do not allow 
them to boil ; then lay them to cool, cover- 
ing them that they may not lose their color; 
sprinkle them with salt and water; put 
them on a colander for twenty-four hours to 
drain. When dry, cut out the thick stalk, 
or, if it be large, divide it, give it a boil, 
and split the flower into eight or ten pieces; 
then put them carefully into jars, and cover 
them with cold vinegar, which has been 
previously boiled with spices ; or the cauli- 
flowers may have one boil in salt and 
vinegar, and be taken out immediately, and 
put into cold vinegar previously boiled with 



446 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

spices two ounces each of coriander-seed 
and turmeric, one ounce each of mustard- 
seed and ginger, with half ounce each of 
mace and nutmeg, or cinnamon, to every 
three quarts of vinegar; the spices may, 
however, be varied. 

Brocoli and the tops of asparagus may be 
pickled in the same manner. 

A GENTLEMAN, on being asked what he had for 
dinner, replied, " A lean wife roasted, and the ruin 
of man for sauce." What did his dinner consist of? 
Of course you give it np, and here's the answer a 
spare rib and oppfe-sauce. 



TO PICKLE TOMATOES. 

516. For this purpose the small round 
ones are the best, and each should be 
pricked with a fork, to allow some of the 
juice to exude, but keep it for the pickle. 
Put them into a deep earthen vessel, sprin- 
kle salt between every layer, and leave 
them there for three days covered ; then 
wash off the salt, and cover them with a 
pickle of cold vinegar, to which add the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 447 

juice, mixed with a large handful of mus- 
tard-seed and one ounce each of cloves and 
white pepper, as being generally sufficient 
for one peck of fruit. It makes an excellent 
sauce for roast meat, and will be ready in 
about a fortnight. 



PICKLED BEETS. 

517. Boil your beets till tender, but 
not quite soft. To four large beets, boil 
three eggs hard, remove the shells; when 
the beets are done, take off the skin by 
laying them for a few minutes in cold water 
and then stripping it off; slice them a 
quarter of an inch thick, put the eggs at 
the bottom, and then put in the beets with 
a little salt. Pour on cold vinegar enough to 
cover them. The eggs imbibe the color of 
the beets, and look beautiful on the table. 

THERE is a mistake, tho' the saying is old, 

To hear a man tell you he has a bad cold ; 

We must drop the saying, though long it has stood, 

For I never heard of a cold that was good. 



448 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

TO PICKLE LEMONS, 

518. Take the finest with the thickest 
rind you can get, cut them deeply from end 
to end in more than one place, but not 
quite through, and fill the incisions with 
salt ; put each on end, and lay them in a 
dish near the fire, or in the sun if the 
weather be hot, to dissolve the salt, and 
repeat this during three weeks; then put 
them into a jar, with a handful of white 
mustard-seed if it be large, one-quarter to 
one-half pound of bruised ginger, half that 
quantity of cloves and allspice, a few chilis, 
and a very little turmeric ; boil in vinegar, 
and pour it upon the lemons when cold. It 
was originally prepared by the cook of the 
first Earl of Orford. 

Some people, however, add to it either 
shalot or garlic. It can hardly be ready 
in less than six months, but will keep for 
many years. 

For limes, or very small lemons, the same 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 449 

method must be pursued, only they will not 
require above half the time. 



CUCUMBERS. 

519. If full-grown, the small long sort 
are the best for pickling. Let them be 
fresh gathered; pull off the blossoms, but 
do not rub them ; pour over them a strong 
brine of salt and water boiling hot, cover 
them close, and let them stand all night. 
The next day stir them gently to take off 
the sand, drain them on a sieve, and dry 
them on a cloth ; make a pickle with the 
best white wine vinegar, ginger, pepper 
(long and round), and a little garlic. 
When the pickle boils, throw in the cu- 
cumbers, cover them, and make them boil 
as quickly as possible for three or four 
minutes ; put them into a jar with the 
vinegar, and cover them closely ; when 
cold, put in a sprig of dill, the seed down-

ward. They will be exceedingly crisp and 
green, done in this manner ; but if they do 
not appear to be of a fine color, boil up the 
pickle the next day, and pour it boiling on 
the cucumbers. 



TO PICKLE GHERKINS. 

520. Choose nice young ones, spread 
them on dishes, salt them, and let them lie 
a week, with a small bit of alum; then 
drain them, and putting them in a jar, 
pour boiling vinegar over them. Set them 
near the fire, covered with plenty of vine 
leaves ; if they do not become a tolerably 
good green, pour the vinegar into another 
jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when 
it becomes too hot to bear your hand, but 
still not to boil, pour it over them again, 
covering with fresh leaves ; and thus do till 
they are of as good a color as you wish. As 
an additional reason for preparing them at 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 451 

home, it is indeed well known that the 
very fine green pickles are made so by 
the dealers using brass or bell-metal vessels, 
which, when vinegar is put into them, 
become highly poisonous. 

If spices be not mixed among the pickle, 
put into the kettle, in a thin muslin bag, 
allspice, mace, and mustard-seed, to every 
quart of vinegar in the proportion of rather 
less than half an ounce each of the former, 
to one ounce of the seed. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

CRANBERRY WATER. 

521. Pour boiling water upon bruised 
cranberries, let them stand for a few hours, 
strain off the liquor, and sweeten to the 
taste. This forms an agreeable and refresh- 
ing beverage for invalids. 



452 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

TO MAKE GRUEL. 

522. Ask those who are to eat it, if 
they like it thick or thin ; if the latter, mix 
well together, by degrees, in a pint basin, 
one tablespoonful of oatmeal, with three of 
cold water if the former, use two table- 
spoonfuls. 

Have ready, in a stewpan, a pint of boil- 
ing water; pour this, by degrees, to the 
oatmeal you have mixed, return it into the 
stewpan, set it on the fire, and let it boil 
for five minutes, stirring it all the time to 
prevent the oatmeal from burning at the 
bottom of the stewpan, skim and strain it 
through a hair sieve. A little wine and 
nutmeg may be added. 



BALM TEA. 

523. Is made by simply pouring boil- 
ing water over some of the leaves in a 
teapot, and letting them infuse. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 453 
APPLE WATER. 

524. Slice some apples, put them in a 
deep pan, and pour enough boiling water 
over them to cover them. Place the cover 
on the pan, and when cold, strain the liquid, 
sweeten it and flavor with a little lemon, if 
agreeable. 



BARLEY WATER. 

525. Wash two ounces of pearl barley 
thoroughly, and boil it for a few minutes in 
half a pint of water. Strain the water off 
and throw it away. Boil the barley in two 
quarts of fresh water until it is reduced to 
one quart; then strain it, and add sugar 
and lemon juice to the taste. 



BEEF TEA 

526. One pound of beef, one quart of 
cold water. Cut the beef in thin slices, and 



454 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

pour on the water. Cover it and set it in 
a warm place for three-quarters of an hour ; 
then put it over a slow fire where it will 
simmer for half an hour. Strain it, and 
serve it hot or cold as recommended by the 
physician. Salt it to the taste. 

When was beef tea first introduced into England? 
When Henry VIII. dissolved the papal bull. 



SLIPPERY-ELM TEA. 

527. Strip your slippery-elm into small 
pieces; take two tablespoonfuls of these 
pieces, and pour over them two teacups of 
boiling water. Let it stand until it be- 
comes mucilaginous, and then strain it. 



VEAL TEA. 

528. Cut one pound of a knuckle of 
veal in thin slices, pour over it a quart of 
cold water. Cover it, and let it simmer for 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 455 

an hour and a half. When boiled to a jelly 
it will keep for three or four days, and may 
be used at any time by pouring over it a 
little boiling water and letting it stand near 
the fire. Add salt to the taste. 



A SCOTCH minister was once ordered " beef tea " 
by his physician. The next day the patient com- 
plained that it had made him sick. " Why, minis- 
ter," said the doctor, " I'll try the tea niysel'." So, 
putting some in a skillet, he warmed it, tasted it, 
and told the minister it was excellent. " Man," 
says the minister, " is that the way ye sup it ?" 
" What ither way should it be suppit ? It's excel- 
lent, I say, minister." " It may be gude that way, 
doctor, but try it wi' the cream and sugar, man ! try 
it wi' that, and then see hoo ye like it." 



IRISH MOSS OR CARRIGAff. 

529. Soak half an ounce of the moss in 
cold water for a few minutes ; then with- 
draw it, shaking the water from each sprig, 
and boil it in a quart of milk till it attains 
the consistence of jelly, and sweeten to the 
taste. A decoction of the same quantity 



456 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

of moss in a quart of water is also used as 
a demulcent in coughs. 

NEITHER let prosperity put out the e} T es of cir- 
cumspection, nor abundance cut off the hands of 
frugality ; he that too much indulges in the super- 
fluities of life, shall live to lament the want of its 
necessaries. 



ISINGLASS BLANCMANGE. 

530. Boil one ounce of isinglass in one 
quart of water till it is reduced to a pint ; 
then add the whites of four eggs, with two 
spoonfuls of water to keep the eggs from 
poaching and sugar enough to make it very 
sweet, and run the liquid through a jelly 
bag ; then put to it two ounces of sweet, 
and half an ounce of bitter almonds ; give 
them a scald in your jelly, and pass the 
whole mixture through a hair sieve, and 
empty it into a china bowl. The next day 
turn it out, and stick it all over with sweet 
almonds, blanched and cut lengthwise. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 457 
BARLEY GRUEL. 

531. Wash two ounces of pearl barley, 
and boil it in a quart of water till reduced 
to a pint ; strain it, and add sugar and wine 
to the taste. 



ACORN COFFEE. 

532. Peel the husks from sound ripe 
acorns, divide the kernels, dry them gradu- 
ally, and roast them in a close vessel; 
while roasting they should be stirred con- 
tinually, and small pieces of butter added 
from time to time. Care must be taken 
not to burn, or roast them too much. 
When roasted, they may be ground and 
used as ordinary coffee. 



ALE POSSET. 

533. Boil a pint of new milk with a 
slice of toasted bread ; pour a bottle of mild 



458 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

ale into a punch bowl, sweeten and add 
spices, and then pour the boiling milk 
over it. 



BREAD PUDDING FOR INFANTS. 

534. Grate some stale bread into a tea- 
cup, pour boiling milk over it, and when 
cold, mix with the yolk of an egg. Boil it 
in a cup for a quarter of an hour. 



CELERY DRESSED AS SLAW. 

535. Cut the celery in pieces about a 
quarter of an inch long. Make a dressing 
of the yolks of three eggs boiled hard, half 
a gill of vinegar, half a gill of sweet oil, one 
teaspoonful of French mustard, or half a 
teaspoonful of common mustard, with salt 
and Cayenne pepper to the taste. Pour 
this mixture over the celery, stir it well 
and send it to the table. It should be 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 459 

kept in cold water to make it crisp, until 
about fifteen minutes before it is sent to 
the table, then drain it and pour the 
dressing over. 

" LET us endeavor that our life, though it be not 
of any great extent and length, yet may be of much 
weight and worth. Let us measure it by work, and 
not by time." 



ECONOMICAL USE OF NUTMEGS. 

536. If a person begins to grate a nut- 
meg from the stalk end, it will prove hol- 
low throughout ; whereas the same nutmeg 
grated from the other end, would prove solid 
to the last. This is because the centre con- 
sists of a number of fibres issuing from the 
stalk, and extending throughout the centre 
of the fruit. When the stalk is grated 
away, those fibres, being attached to no 
other part, lose their hold, and drop out, 
and a hollow is formed through the whole 
nut. 



460 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
BREAKFAST DISH OF COLD MEAT. 

537. Cut the meat in pieces about an 
inch square, put them into a stewpan with 
some butter, or a little of the cold gravy. 
Season with pepper and salt. As soon as 
the meat is very hot, add a little flour to 
thicken the gravy, and serve. 

A FASTIDIOUS taste is like a squeamish appetite ; 
the one has its origin in some diseases of the mind, 
as the other has in some ailment of the stomach. 



. CHEESE SOUFFLE, OR FONDTT. 

538. Grate six ounces of rich cheese 
(Parmesan is the best) ; put it into an 
enamelled saucepan, with a teaspoonful of 
flour of mustard, a saltspoonful of white 
pepper, a grain of Cayenne, the sixth part 
of a nutmeg, grated, two ounces of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of baked flour, and a 
gill of new milk ; stir it over a slow fire 
till it becomes like smooth thick cream (but 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 461 

it must not boil) ; add the well-beaten yolk 
of six eggs ; beat for ten minutes ; then 
add the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth ; pour the mixture into a tin, or 
a card-board mould, and bake in a quick 
oven for twenty minutes. Serve imme- 
diately. 

HUMAN PULSATION. An ingenious author asserts 
that the length of a man's life may be estimated by 
the number of pulsations he has strength to per- 
form. Thus, allowing seventy years for the com- 

\j \j 

mon age of man, and sixty pulses in a minute for 
the usual measure of pulses in a temperate person, 
the number of pulsations in his whole life would 
amount to 2,207,520,000 ; but if, by intemperance or 
other causes, he forces his blood permanently into a 
more rapid movement, so as to give seventy-five 
pulses to the minute, the same number of pulses 
would be completed in fifty-six years ; consequently 
shortening his life by fourteen years. 



TO CLARIFY DRIPPING. 

539. Set it on the fire in a clean pan, 
and when melted and just going to boil, 
take it off and pour it into another pan half 



4G2 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

filled with boiling hot water ; stir the two 
well together with a broad, wooden spoon, 
and then remove the pan into a cool place 
till the next day, when the clarified drip- 
ping will be found floating on the surface 
of the water. 



CHICKEN JELLY. 

540. Take a large chicken, cut it up 
into very small pieces. Bruise the bones, 
and put the whole into a stone jar, with a 
cover that will make it water tight. Set 
the jar in a large kettle of boiling water, 
and keep it boiling for three hours. Then 
strain off the liquid, and season it slightly 
with salt, pepper, and mace ; or, with loaf 
sugar and lemon juice, according to the 
taste of the person for whom it is intended. 
Return the fragments of the chicken to the 
jar, and set it again in a kettle of boiling 
water. You will find that you can collect 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 463 

nearly as much jelly by the second boiling. 
This jelly may be made of an old fowl. 

DUKE DE ALBA once replied to the king, who 
asked him whether he had seen the eclipse of the 
sun, that he had so much business to do upon earth, 
that he had no time to look up to heaven, 



GINGER BEER. 

541. One ounce and a half of ginger 
well bruised, one ounce of cream of tartar, 
one pound of loaf sugar, and one lemon, to 
every gallon of water. Put these ingredi- 
ents into an earthen pan, and pour upon 
them the water boiling. When cold, add 
a teaspoonful of yeast to each gallon. Let 
it stand twenty-four hours, then skim it. 
Bottle it, and keep it in a cool place before 
you drink it. 

11 Now, gentlemen," said a nobleman to his 
guests as the ladies left the room, "let us under- 
stand each other are we to drink like men or like 
brutes ?' ! The guests, somewhat indignant, ex- 
claimed, "like men, of course." "Then," replied 
he, " we are going to get jolly drunk, for brutes 
never drink more than they want." 



464 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

CHERRY ICE. 

542. Stone two pounds of ripe cherries, 
bruise and set them on the fire, with a little 
water, and a half pound of sugar ; when 
they have boiled, pass them through a hair 
sieve into an earthen pan ; pound a handful 
of the kernels, put them in a basin with 
the juice of two lemons, add to the cherries 
a pound of sugar, and strain on them the 
lemon juice and kernels; mix the whole 
together and put it into a freezer with 
pounded ice ; work the cherries up with 
it well until it has set, then place it in 
glasses. 



WATER ICES GENERALLY. 

543. If made from jams, you must rub 
them through a sieve, adding thick boiled 
syrup and lemon juice, and some jelly and 
coloring ; if for pink, add the white of an 
egg whipt up, before you add it to the best 
half of a pint of spring water; if of jam, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 465 

you must have a good pint of mixture in 
all. to make a quart mould ; if from fruits 
with syrup, you will not require water. 



PORTABLE LEMONADE. 

544. Take of tartaric acid, half an 
ounce ; loaf sugar, three ounces ; essence 
of lemon, half a drachm. Powder the 
tartaric acid and the sugar very fine in a 
marble or Wedgewood mortar (observe never 
to use a metal one), mix them together, 
and pour the essence of lemon upon them, 
by a few drop at a time, stirring the mix- 
ture after each addition, till the whole is 
added ; then mix them thoroughly and 
divide it into twelve equal parts, wrapping 
each up separately in a piece of white 
paper. When wanted for use, it is only 
necessary to dissolve it in a tumbler of cold 
water, and fine lemonade will be obtained, 
containing the flavor of the juice and peel 

of the lemon, and ready sweetened. 
29 



466 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK 

! BEER. 

545. To four gallons of water, take two 
pounds of sugar, one quart of molasses, 
half a teacupful of ginger, one pint of sots, 
two spoonfuls of cream of tartar, one and 
a half spoonfuls of ground allspice, and 
three drops of oil of sassafras. Put the 
spices into bags; heat the water and pour 
it over the spices; mix the whole of the 
ingredients in an open vessel, let it stand 
over night, then skim off the top of the 
liquid, take out the bags of spices, and 
pour it carefully into jugs, bottles, or a 
keg; it will be fit for use in twenty-four 
hours. 



BUTTERED EGGS. 

546. Break four or five eggs carefully 
into separate cups ; put two ounces of good 
butter into a bright tin dish, and put it into 
the oven. When the butter boils, lay in 
the eggs carefully, and over each sprinkle 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 467 

white pepper and salt very lightly ; put 
them in the oven for five or six minutes. 
Serve in the dish they are cooked in. 

" WHAT is the reason your wife and you always 
disagree ?" asked one Irishman of another. " Be- 
cause we are both of one mind. She wants to be 
master, and so do I." 



MELTED BUTTER. 

547. This simple luxury, owing to 
ignorance or carelessness in making, is often 
any thing but a luxury. First, be particu- 
lar to have an exceedingly clean saucepan. 
Put into it in the proportions of a small 
teacupful of water, two ounces of butter 
and a large teaspoonful of flour. The flour 
should be mixed smoothly with the cold 
liquid before it is put near the fire, and 
if the mixture is allowed to stand an hour 
before melting so much the better ; but it 
must not be put near the fire until it is 
ready to be melted. When once upon the 
fire, keep it stirred, or move it by occasion- 



468 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

ally shaking the saucepan ; but use the 
utmost caution to stir or shake it so that 
the liquid should always go around in the 
saucepan in the same way ; if it sometimes 
moves to the right and then to the left, it 
will be oiled, and then the best thing to do 
is to throw it away. A little cream or 
good milk may be used instead of part 
water, and will be found an improvement. 

A KING'S SPEECH. Charles II., asked Bishop 
Stillingfleet, how it happened that he generally 
preached without a book, but always read the ser- 
mons which he delivered before the court. The 
bishop asked in turn why he read his speeches in 
parliament. " Why, Doctor," replied his merry 
majesty. " I'll tell you candidly ; I have asked 
them so often for money that I am ashamed to look 
them in the face." 



TO FRESHEN SALT BUTTER. 
548. Churn it afresh with new milk, 
in the proportion of a pound of butter to 
a quart of milk. 

WHERE is the hoe, Sambo?" " Wid de rake, 
massa." " Well, where is the rake ?" " Why, wid 
de hoe." "Well, well, where are they both?" 
" Why, bote togedder, massa ; you 'pears to be berry 
'ticular dis mornin'." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 469 
FOOD FOR DELICATE INFANTS. 

549. Take a piece of gelatin (or Ameri- 
can isinglass) about one inch square, dis- 
solve it in half a gill of water over the fire 
then add a gill of milk. When it comes 
to a boil, stir in a good half teaspoonful 
of arrowroot. When taken off the fire, stir 
in two tablespoonfuls of cream. This food 
is suitable for a child four or five months 
old. As the child becomes older, increase 
the strength of the food. 

YICE AND VIRTUE. Those who have resources 
within themselves, who can dare to live alone, want 
friends the least, but, at the same time, best know 
how to prize them the most. But no company is 
far preferable to bad, because we are more apt to 
catch the vices of others than their virtues, as dis- 
ease is far more contagious than health. 



PRESERVING EGGS. 

550. The following receipt has been 
tried for several years with unvarying 
success. To five quarts of cold water add 



470 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

one pound of salt and one ounce of salt- 
petre ; boil tegether for about twenty 
minutes, and when nearly cold, add four 
tablespoonfuls of pounded quick lime. Let 
it stand three days, stirring it twice a day. 
Place the eggs (which should be quite 
fresh) in a jar, with the small end down- 
ward, and pour the mixture upon them. 
Additional layers may be added, as conve- 
nient, and from thirty to fifty eggs may be 
done in one jar. They will keep for 
months, but must not be taken out of the 
lime till they are about to be used, when 
they will be found to be perfectly fresh. 
The lime should cover the eggs full two 
inches above them. 

PLEASANT TRAVELLING. In Edinburgh resides 

Mr. C , who is as huge, though not as witty as 

Falstaff. It is his custom when he travels to book 
two places, and thus to secure half of the inside of 
the coach to himself. He sent his servant the other 
day to book him for Glasgow. The man returned 
with the following pleasing intelligence : " I've 
booked you, sir ; but as there wern't two inside 
places left, I booked you one in and one out." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 471 
PLAIN OMELETTE. 

551. Beat four eggs very light. Have 
ready a pan of hot butter, pour the beaten 
eggs into it, and fry it till it is of a fine 
brown on the under side, then lap one half 
over the other, and serve it hot. Just be- 
fore you lap it, sprinkle a little salt and 
pepper over the top. Chopped parsley or 
onion may be mixed with the egg before it 
is fried. 

A PERSON asking Diogenes what was the best din- 
ner-hour, he answered. "Any hour." "Nay," said 
the man, " any hour will not suit rich and poor too." 
"But it will, though," retorted the philosopher; 
" a rich man can dine &ny hour, that he likes ; but 
a poor man any hour that he can.' 1 ' 1 



RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

552. Take ripe raspberries, put them 
in a pan, and mash them with a large 
wooden spoon or masher. Strain the juice 
through a jelly bag, and to each pint of 
juice, add one pound of loaf sugar, and one 



472 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

quart of vinegar. When the sugar has dis- 
solved, place the whole over the fire in a 
preserving kettle, and let it boil a minute or 
two, and skim it. When cold, bottle it, 
cork it well, and it will be fit for use. 

A LAUNDRESS, who was employed in the family of 
a governor, said to him with a sigh. " Only think, 
your excellency, how small a sum of money would 
make me happy." " How little, madam ?" said the 
governor. "Oh! dear sir, twenty pounds would 
make me perfectly happy." "Then I will send it 
to you to-morrow ; upon the understanding that that 
amount will make } r our happiness perfect." "I 
thank you, and assure you that it will," she said, 
and took her departure. She was no sooner outside 
the door than she thought she might as well have 
asked and received forty ; so she stepped back, say- 
ing, "please make it forty." " Ah! 1 am released," 
said the governor, " you have proved that the 
twenty would not make you happy ; nor would any 
other sum." 



RESTORATIVE JELLY FOR INVALIDS. 

553. Take two ounces of isinglass ; one 
ounce of gum arabic ; and one ounce of 
sugar candy. Put these into half a pint of 
spring water, and let them remain eight 
hours ; then simmer over a slow fire, or in a 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 473 

jar in the oven, until dissolved. Add half 
a pint of good sherry; and, when nearly 
cold, flavor with nutmeg or cloves. This is 
excellent. 

TRUE wisdom is less presuming than folly ; the 
wise man doubteth often, and changeth his mind ; the 
fool is obstinate and doubteth not ; he knoweth all 
things but his own ignorance. 



TOASTED CHEESE. 

554. This preparation is popularly 
known as Welsh Rabbit or Rarebit. Cut 
some cheese into thin shavings, and put it 
with a bit of butter into a pan. Place it 
over a gentle fire, and stir it till the cheese 
dissolves. Serve it with toasted bread, in 
the bottom of the dish. 

" 'Tis being, and doing, and having, that make 
All the pleasures and pains, of which people par- 
take, 

To be what God pleases, to do a man's best, 
And to have a good heart, is the way to be blest. 



474 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
r QUEEN'S TOAST. 

555. Fry some slices of stale bread a 
fine brown ; then dip each slice quickly in 
some boiling water to remove the grease. 
Place them in layers on a dish. They may 
be put in the form of a pyramid. Serve 
with any kind of sweet sauce ; or they may 
be eaten with butter and smrar.

A TURKISH proverb runs thus : The devil 
tempts all, except idle men, and they tempt the

SANDWICHES. 

556. Cut the bread moderately thin, 
butter it very slightly indeed ; lay the meat 
cut thin, season with salt, pepper, and mus- 
tard, as may be required ; cover with a sec- 
ond slice of bread, trim the edges, put them 
one on the other, and cover with a damp 
cloth until required. Where tongue is used, 
it should be boiled the day before, and when 
thoroughly done pressed in a mould. Chicken 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 475 

boned and forced with a small quantity of 
forced veal and ham, and treated in the 
same way, will make excellent sandwiches. 
All kinds of meat used for sandwiches 
should be thoroughly done. 

WHY should starvation be unknown in the desert ? 
Because of the sand-which-is there. But how came 
the sandwiches there ? Noah sent Ham, and his 
descendants bred and mustered. 



HAM SANDWICHES. 

557. Slice some cold boiled ham very 
thin, and spread over them a little French 
mustard. Place a slice of the ham between 
two thin slices of bread and butter. Or the 
ham may be laid on a very thin slice of but- 
tered bread ; roll it up, taking care not to 
break the crust. 



BLACKBERRY CORDIAL. 

558. To one quart of blackberry juice, 
add one pound of white sugar, half an ounce 



476 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of grated nutmeg, and half an ounce of 
pulverized cinnamon. Tie the spice in a 
fine muslin bag, boil the whole and skim it. 
When no more scum rises, set it away to get 
cold, and add one pint of best brandy. 
Cloves and allspice may be added in the 
proportion of a quarter of an ounce of each. 




COFFEE. 

559. Beat an egg, and to one teacupful 
of ground coffee, add one-third of the beaten 
egg, and as much cold water as will just 
moisten the coffee ; do not put in much cold 
water, stir all well together, put the mixture 
in your coffee pot, and pour over it six tea- 
cupfuls of boiling water. Let it boil hard 
for ten or fifteen minutes. When it begins 
to boil, stir it frequently, and never leave it 
until the grounds sink, which they will do 
in a few minutes after it has been on the 
fire. Be careful and do not let your coffee 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 477 

boil over, as by that means you lose a great 
deal of the grounds, and consequently the 
coffee will be weakened. Rinse your pot, 
if it be silver or Britannia metal, with boil- 
ing water, pour the coffee into it, and serve 
it hot. Coffee and tea lose much of their 
flavor if served cold. 

MY uncle P was an awful snorer. He could 

be heard as far as a blacksmith's forge ; but my aunt 
became so accustomed to it, that it soothed her re- 
pose. They were a very domestic couple never 
slept far apart for many years. At length my uncle 
was required to leave home for some days on busi- 
ness. The first night after his departure, my aunt 
never slept a wink ; she missed the snoring. The 
second night was passed in the same restless manner. 
She was getting in a very bad way, and probably 
it would hare been serious, had it not been for the 
ingenuity of a servant girl ; she took the coffee mill 
into my aunt's bed-room, and ground her to sleep at 
once ! 



RAISIN WINE. 

560. Boil the water, which is to be 
used for the wine, and let it cool. Then 
put into a cask, eight pounds of raisins, for 
each gallon of water. Put the fruit and 



478 THE YOUNG WIFES OOOK BOOK. 

water into the cask alternately, until the 
cask is quite full. Lay the bung in lightly ; 
stir the wine every day or two. Keep the 
cask full by the addition of cold water 
which has been boiled. As soon as fermenta- 
tion ceases, put the bung in tightly, and 
leave the wine untouched for a year. Then 
draw it off in a clean cask, and fine it with 
a piece of isinglass tied in a muslin bag, 
and suspended in the liquor. The refuse 
raisins make good vinegar, if fresh water be 
poured over them, and the cask set in the 
sun. 

A WIT and a fool in company, are like a crab and 
an o} 7 ster ; the one watches till the other opens his 
mouth, and then makes small work of him. 



GINGER WINE. 

561. To four gallons of water, put 
eight pounds of white sugar, and half a 
pound of bruised ginger. Boil the whole 
together, and pour the liquor in a vessel to 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 479 

cool. To each gallon, add the juice and 
rind of four lemons. Toast a piece of bread, 
cover it with fresh yeast, and put it in the 
liquor. As soon as it begins to ferment, 
put it into a cask. When the fermentation 
subsides, which will be in two or three 
weeks, add two pounds of raisins which 
have been stoned. In two months it may 
be bottled. 

CHILDREN and fools, says an old adage, always 
tell the truth. "Mother sent me," said a little girl, 
" to come and ask you to take tea with her this even- 
ing." " Did she say at what time, my dear ?" " No, 
ma'am, she only said she would ask you, and, then 
it would be off her mind." 



SAMP. 

562. This dish is made of new Indian 
corn crushed, but not ground. It should be 
boiled very slowly until quite soft, and sea- 
soned with a little salt. It may be eaten 
with sugar and good milk or cream, or with 
molasses. When cold it may be cut into 



480 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

slices and fried a nice brown. This latter 
dish is very appropriate for breakfast. 



MOCK OYSTERS, 

563. Boil some salsify, in water, with 

a little salt. When soft, mash it, and season 
it with pepper, salt, and a lump of butter. 

Have ready some bread crumbs or grated 
cracker, and a couple of eggs, well beaten. 
With a spoon, take out some of the salsify, 
dip it in the egg, and then in the cracker, 
and fry a light brown on both sides. 

A CLERK was assisting a clergyman, who had 
come to preach a charity sermon, to robe before the 
service commenced, when he said to him, " Please 
sir, I am deaf." " Indeed, my good man," said the 
clergyman, " then how do you manage to follow me 
through the service ?" " Why, sir," said the clerk, 
" I looks up, and when you shuts your mouth I 
opens mine." 



TO PRESERVE MILK, 



564. Take any quantity of really fresh 
milk, put it into a bottle well corked, and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 481 

plunge into boiling water for a quarter of 
an hour. 

OUR attention tias latety been directed to an in- 
vention for obtaining milk in a solidified form, for 
sea-voyages. A funny friend of ours, says it must 
be a capital invention, for solidified milk must ob- 
viously be "quite the cheese." 



TEA. 

565. Scald your teapot with boiling 
water, and allow a teaspoonful of tea for 
each person and one over. Pour enough 
boiling water on the tea leaves to rather 
more than wet them. Let it stand fifteen 
minutes ; pour on as much boiling water as 
will serve one cup to each one of the 
company. As soon as the first cups are 
poured out, add half a teaspoonful for each 
person, and pour on some boiling water. 
The most convenient article for hot water 
is an urn with a spirit lamp under it, which 
keeps it boiling on the table. But the 

30 



482 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

water may be kept sufficiently hot in an 
ordinary teapot. 

Some who are particular about their tea, 
stop the spout of the teapot with a cork 
while the tea is drawing, to retain the 
aroma. 

TEA came into general use sooner in England 
than in Scotland. In ] 685 the widow of the Duke 
of Monmouth sent a pound of it to one of her 
relations in Scotland. This Chinese production 
was then unknown. They examined it with great 
attention, and ordered the cook to come, who, after 
a long examination, decided that it was some dried 
herb. They abandoned to him this precious eata- 
ble to use as he thought proper. Consequently he 
bad the leaves boiled, threw the water away, and 
fcerved them up like spinach. The guests did not 
finJ the garden stuff to their taste, and its reputa- 
tLn in Scotland thus suffered for a long time. 



THE BEST METHOD OF MAKING TEA. 

566. When tea is made out of the 
room, its volatile and essential proper- 
ties are frequently dissipated before it 
comes to the table. It is not the bitter- 
ness, but the fragrance of the tea that 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 483 

is refreshing. The tea should be wetted or 
steeped, before the larger quantity of water 
is added. But if the tea and the pot are 
both warmed dry, before any portion of the 
water is added, a stronger infusion will be 
obtained. Put the tea, dry, into the empty 
pot ; then place the pot before the fire, or 
on the hot plate of an oven till the tea is 
well heated, but not burned; then pour 
upon it the boiling water, and a fragrant 
infusion will be immediately produced. 
Whether tea should be boiled or not, 
depends in some measure upon the constitu- 
tion and inclination of the consumer. If it 
is generally found to be too exciting, and if 
also a full and slightly bitter infusion is 
preferred, the tea should be boiled a few 
minutes, because boiling dissipates the vola- 
tile extract which disturbs the nervous 
system, and develops by solution the bitter 
principle. 

"FATHER," said a roguish boy, "I hope you 
won't buy any more gunpowder tea for mother." 



484 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 



" 



Why not?" "Because every time she sits down 
to the tea-table, she blows us up /" " Go to bed, 
sir, immediately." 



RHUBARB WINE. 

567. Cut five pounds of rhubarb into 
small pieces; add a gallon of cold water, 
and put it into a tub for eight or nine days, 
stirring it well two or three times a day. 
Strain the liquor, and to every gallon add 
four pounds of sugar, the juice and half the 
rind of a lemon ; put it in a cask, with half 
an ounce of isinglass dissolved in a little of 
the liquor. Add a gill of brandy. Bung 
the cask closely. Bottle it in ten or twelve 
months. 



A CHEAP SUMMER DRINK. 

568. Pour two bottles of porter into 
three quarts of water and one pint of the 
best molasses. Mix this well together, and 
in three or four days it will be fit for use. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 485 
TO CURE HAMS. 

569. Mix together, eight pounds of 
salt, two ounces of saltpetre, two pounds of 
brown sugar, one ounce and a half of 
potash, and four gallons of water. This 
brine is sufficient for every one hundred 
pounds of meat. The brine should be 
poured over the pork after it has laid in 
the tub for about two days. Let the hams 
remain in the brine six weeks, then dry 
them several days before smoking. The 
meat may be rubbed with fine salt when it 
is packed down. The meat should be 
thoroughly cool before packing. 

A PRUDENT man advised his drunken servant to 
put by his money for a rainy day. In a few weeks 
the master inquired how much of his wages he had 
saved. "Faith, none at all," said he, "it rained 
yesterday, and it all went." 



ANOTHER MODE OF CURING HAMS. 

570. To every hundred pounds of pork, 
take a bushel and half a peck of salt, three 



486 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

pounds of saltpetre, three pounds of sugar, 
and two quarts of molasses. Mix these 
ingredients, and rub the meat with it well. 
At the end of nine days, take out the hams 
and put those which were at the top at the 
bottom. In three weeks, take out the meat. 
Kemember to rub the hams often with the 
salt, etc., while it is in the tub, so that 
every part may be thoroughly impregnated. 

" WHAT makes you get up so late, sir ?" said a 
father to his son, who made his appearance at the 
breakfast table about ten o' clock. " Late ! why 
father I was up with the lark." "Well, then, sir, 
for the future don't remain so long up with the 
lark, but come down a little earlier to breakfast." 



COLD MEAT, GAME OR POULTRY, DRESSED 

AS FRITTERS. 

571. Weigh the meat, and put an equal 
weight of bread crumbs to soak in cold 
water ; let there be a little fat with the 
meat, and cut it into small dice. Squeeze 
the water from the bread ; put in the pan 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 487 

two ounces of butter or lard, and two table- 
spoonfuls of onion, chopped fine ; fry two 
minutes, then add the bread, stir with a 
wooden spoon until rather dry ; then add 
the meat ; season with salt and pepper to 
taste, add a little nutmeg, if approved ; stir 
till quite hot ; then add gradually two eggs 
well beaten ; mix quickly, and pour on a 
dish to cool. Roll into the shape of small 
eggs, egg and bread crumb them, and fry. 
Serve plain with any appropriate sauce. 

WHAT wind does a hungry sailor like best ? One 
that blows foul, afterward chops, and then comes 
with little puffs. 



BOILED TRIPE. 

572. Scrape and wash the tripe very 
clean, boil it in water with salt enough to 
season the tripe ; when very tender, have 
ready some onions, boiled and washed, and 
well seasoned with pepper, salt, and a lump 
of butter ; put the onions in a deep dish, 



488 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

arid lay the tripe on the top, or serve them 
in separate dishes. 

Some persons like tripe boiled plainly in 
water, and served with onion sauce and 
mustard. 

VIRTUE comes from industry quite as much as from 
morality. "An idle head is Satan's workshop ;" 
and let a man do nothing for a fortnight, the old 
adversary will get possession of his pate, bring in 
a stock of evil thoughts, start the machinery of 
low passions, and commence his regular business 
of producing sin. 



FRIED TRIPE. 

573. Tripe may be fried in egg and 
bread crumbs like oysters, and is then a 
very nice dish ; it should first be boiled till 
tender ; it may be fried without the egg or 
crumbs, in gravy, thickened with a little 
flour, and flavored with catchup or vinegar. 

WEAR your learning like your watch, in a private 
pocket, and don't pull it out to show that you have 
one ; but if you are asked what o'clock it is, answer 
accordingly. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 489 

AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR PASTRY 
FOR THE DYSPEPTIC. 

574. Boil a teacupful of sago as thick 
as it can be made to boil, without burning ; 
put about five spoonfuls into a quart basin ; 
then a layer of baked fruit of any sort, 
sweetened, and fill the basin to the brim 
with alternate layers of fruit and sago. Set 
in a cool place for a little time, and it will 
become solid. It is best when made shortly 
after breakfast, and allowed to stand till 
wanted, to warm either in an oven, over 
boiling water, or before the fire, with a plate 
turned over it, for dinner. The sago boils 
best when soaked in cold water for a few 
hours before using. Rice may be used in 
the same way. Serve with any sweet sauce. 



TO KEEP CHESTNUTS. 

f 575. To preserve chestnuts, in order 
/ to have them good and fresh, to eat through 



490 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

the winter, you must make them perfectly 
dry after they have come out of their green 
husks ; then put them into a box or barrel, 
mixed with, and covered over by fine and 
dry sand, three gallons of sand, to one gal- 
lon of chestnuts. If there be maggots in 
any of the chestnuts, they will come out 
of the chestnuts, and work up through the 
sand to get to the air ; and thus you have 
your chestnuts sweet, sound, and fresh. 

HAVE you ever watched an icicle as it formed ? 
You noticed how it froze one drop at a time. If 
the water was clean, the icicle remained clear, and 
sparkled in the sun ; but if the water was slightly 
muddy, the icicle looked foul, and its beauty was 
spoiled. Just so our characters are forming. One 
little thought or feeling at a time, adds its influence. 
If every thought be pure, the soul will be lovely, 
and will sparkle with happiness ; but if impure, 
there will always be wretchedness. 



CELERY FOR FLAVORING. 

76. Celery leaves, and ends, are used 
for flavoring soups, gravies, sauces, etc. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 491 
TO COLOR BUTTER. 

577. For every four quarts of cream, 
grate one middling sized carrot, pour on it 
half a pint of boiling water, let it stand 
until cool, and strain the liquor into the 
cream. It does not hurt the flavor. 

How few do eat and drink, not merely with an in- 
tention to preserve the body in health and strength, 
but with such prudence, care and caution, as not to 
over cherish and pamper, to embolden and enlarge 
their bodies. 



ESSENCE OF CELERY. 

578. Soak a tablespoonful of celery 
seeds, in a large teacupful of brandy. A 
few drops will suffice to flavor a quart of 
soup. 

THE thieving propensities of "the cat" are well 
known. How does "the cat" contrive to open the 
side-board ? How is it, that after drinking our gin, 
she never seems intoxicated ? Whatever can the cat 
do with the tea ? And how, when she breaks a plate, 
does she manage to pick up the pieces !

ELDERBERRY WINE. 

579. To ten quarts of berries, put five 
quarts of water, and let it stand twenty- 
four hours. Then boil and skim it ; strain 
it, and to every gallon of the liquor put 
three pounds of sugar, half an ounce of 
cloves, one ounce of cinnamon, and two 
ounces of ginger. Boil it again, and fer- 
ment it, by putting in it a slice of toast 
covered with fresh yeast. By leaving out 
the spices, this wine is said to resemble 
Port, 

AT a hotel at Hastings, Jerrold was dining with 
two friends, one of whom, after dinner, ordered, 
among other pleasant things, " a bottle of old port." 
"Waiter," said Douglas, with that twinkle of the 
eye, that was always a promise of wit, " Mind, now, 
a, bottle of your old port, not your elder port." 



f 

PATTIES OF FRIED BREAD. 

580. Cut the crumb of a loaf, into 
square or round pieces, nearly three inches 
high, and cut bits, the same width for tops ; 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 493 

mark them neatly with a knife; fry the 
bread of a light brown color, in fine lard. 
Scoop out the inside crumb, taking care not 
to go too near the bottom; fill the space 
with meat ; put on the tops, and serve. 

A SAILOR went to a conjuror's exhibition. There 
were to be fireworks at the conclusion ; but they 
accidentally exploded and blew up the room. The 
sailor fell in a potato field, just outside, unhurt ; he 
got up, and shook himself, and walked back toward 
the room, exclaiming, " Confound the fellow, / won- 
der what he will do next /" 



MOLASSES CANDY. 

581. One quart of West India molasses, 
half a pound of brown sugar, the juice of 
one lemon. Put the molasses in a kettle 
with the sugar, boil it over a slow, steady 
fire, till it is done, which you can easily tell 
by dropping a little in cold water ; if done, 
it will be crisp, if not, it will be stringy. A 
good way to judge if it is boiled enough, is 
to let it boil, till it stops bubbling. Stir it 



494 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

very frequently, and just before it is taken 
off the fire, add the lemon juice. Butter a 
shallow tin pan, and pour it in to get cold. 
Molasses candy may be flavored with any 
thing you choose. Some flavor with lemon, 
and add roasted ground-nuts, or almonds 
blanched. 

'Tis good advice that St. Jerome gives ; still be 
doing some warrantable work, that the devil may 
always find thee well employed. 



CHEESE TOASTED. 

582. This preparation is popularly 
known as Welsh rabbit or rarebit. Cut 
some cheese into thin shavings, and put it 
with a bit of butter, into a cheese toaster ; 
place it before the fire, until the cheese dis- 
solves, stirring it occasionally. Serve with 
a slice of toasted bread, the crust pared off. 

Two city ladies meeting at a visit, one of them a 
grocer's wife, and the other a cheesemonger's (who 
perhaps stood more upon the punctilio of prece- 
dence, than some of their betters would have done 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 495 

at the court end of the town), when they had risen 
up and took their leaves, the cheesemonger's wife 
was going out of the room first, upon which the 
grocer's lady, pulling her back by the tail of her 
gown, and stepping before her, "No, madam," said 
she, " nothing comes after cheese." 



GOOSEBERRY CHAMPAGNE. 

583. Select large full grown berries, 
before they begin to turn red. Allow a gal- 
lon of water to every three pounds of fruit. 
Put the berries in a clean tub, pour on a 
little water, pound and mash the fruit ; then 
add the remainder of the water, and stir the 
whole well. Cover the tub with a clean 
cloth, and let it stand four days. Stir it 
frequently and thoroughly ; then strain the 
liquid through a jelly bag, or coarse linen 
cloth, and to each gallon, add four pounds of 
white sugar, and to every five gallons, one 
quart of the best French brandy. Mix the 
whole, and put it into a clean cask that will 
just hold it, as the cask should be full. 



496 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

Place the cask in a cool dry place, and lay 
the bung in loosely. Secure the cask firmly, 
so that it cannot be shaken or moved, as 
the least disturbance will injure the wine. 
Let it work for two weeks, or more, until 
the fermentation is subsided. Then bottle 
it, and be careful to drive the corks in 
tightly. Lay the bottles on their sides, and 
in six months, the wine will be fit for use. 



TO MAKE COTTAGE BEER. 

584. Take a quarter of a peck of good 
white bran, and put it into ten gallons of 
water, with three handfuls of hops, boil the 
whole together until the bran and the hops 
sink to the bottom. Then strain it through 
a hair sieve into a cooler, and when it is 
about lukewarm, add two quarts of molasses. 
As soon as the molasses is thoroughly in- 
corporated, pour the whole into a nine gal- 
lon cask, with two tablespoonfuls of yeast. 



THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 497 

When the fermentation has subsided, bung 
up the cask, and in four days it will be fit 
for use. Table beer, if drawn off into stone 
jars, with a lump of white sugar in each, 
and securely corked, will keep good for 
several months. 

" THIS is capital ale see how long it keeps its 
head !" " Aye, but consider how soon it takes away 
yours." 



TO MAKE PERRY, 

585. Let the pears be sweet and per- 
fectly ripe, but take care that the cores 
have not become rotten ; take them to the 
press or mill, and squeeze out the juice, 
from whence the liquor is removed to casks, 
which must stand in the open air, in a very 
cool place, with the bung-holes open. The 
fermentation is accomplished by mixing a 
pint of new yeast with a little honey and 
flour warmed, and the whites of four eggs. 
Put this in a bag of thin muslin, drop it in. 

31 



498 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

the cask, and suspend it from the bung-hole 
by a string, taking care that it does not 
touch the bottom of the vessel. If it works 
well, the liquor will have cleared itself in 
five or six days, and may be drawn off from 
the lees into smaller casks, or bottled. In 
winter, Perry requires to be kept warm, 
and free from frosts or draughts of air. In 
summer, the vesssels or bottles containing it 
must be moved to a cool place, otherwise 
they will burst. 

A MAN praising Perry, said it was so excellent a 
beverage, that in great quantities it alwa3 7 s made 
him fat. " I have seen the time," said another, 
"when it made 3^011 lean." ''When?" asked the 
eulogist. " Last night against a wall." 



SPRUCE BEER. 

586. Pour eight gallons of cold water 
into a barrel ; to this add eight gallons of 
boiling water ; then put in six tablespoonfuls 
of essence of spruce, and sixteen pounds of 
molasses. When sufficiently cold, add half 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 499 



n pint of yeast, and roll the cask about, or 
shake it well. Keep it in a warm place for 
two days, with the bung open ; by this time 
the fermentation will have subsided suffi- 
ciently for bottling. Bottle it, or put it in 
stone jars well corked, and it will be fit for 
use in a week. 

A GENTLEMAN who had put aside two bottles of 
choice ale, discovered, just before dinner, that his 
servant had emptied them both. " Scoundrel 1" ex- 
claimed the master, " what do you mean by this ?" 
" Why, sir, I saw plainly enough by the clouds that 
it was going to thunder, so I drank it, to prevent 
its turning sour there's nothing I abominate, like 
waste 1" 



THE BEST GINGER BEER, 

587. White sugar, twenty pounds; 
lemon or lime juice, eighteen ounces ; honey, 
one pound; white ginger, bruised, twenty- 
two ounces; water, eighteen gallons. Boil 
the bruised ginger in three gallons of water 
for half an hour ; then add the sugar, the 
juice, and the honey with the remainder 



500 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of the water. Boil and strain. When cold, 
add the white of an egg, and half an ounce 
of essence of lemon. Allow it to ferment 
in the usual way. Then in about four days 
bottle it, and it will keep for months. 
Smaller quantities may be made by redu- 
cing the ingredients in equal proportions. 

A TOPER, being on a visit to a neighboring 
squire, when a very small glass was set before him 
after dinner, pulled the servant by the tail of his 
coat, and expostulated with him. " What is this 
glass for ? Does your master intend to keep me 
here all night.'" 







CHERRY BOUNCE. 

588. To fifteen pounds of morella cher- 
ries, add one gallon of the best French 
brandy or good Monongahela whisky. Let 
them stand for three or four months, then 
pour off the liquor, and add to the cherries 
two quarts of water, which should remain 
on them three weeks ; pour off the water 



THE YOTTXa TTTFE's COOK BOOK. 501 

and add it to the liquor; to all of which 
add four pounds of sugar made into a syrup. 

BEWARE of such food as persuades a man, though 
he be not hungry, to eat ; and those liquors that 
prevail with a man to drink them when he is not 
thirsty. 



SAVORY MACARONI. 

(NAPLES RECEIPT.) 

589. Blanch six ounces of Naples 
macaroni in two quarts of boiling water, 
with a tablespoonful of salt in it; let it 
remain till cold, then drain on a sieve. Put 
it into an enamelled saucepan with two 
ounces of butter, and stir over the fire till 
the butter is absorbed ; then add a quart of 
new milk and simmer very gently till quite 
tender (about an hour and a half); add 
a teaspoonful of flour of mustard, a salt- 
spoonful of white pepper, the sixth part of a 
nutmeg, grated, a grain of Cayenne, three 
ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, and two 
fresh eggs, beaten with a gill of thick cream ; 



502 THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

place it on a dish and sift grated Parmesan 
cheese thickly over (three ounces) ; on that 
lay an ounce of butter, in small pieces ; 
bake in a quick oven, or before the fire, till 
of a pale brown color, from twelve to fifteen 
minutes. Serve very hot. 

AT Gibraltar there was a great scarcity of water, 
and a general complaint of the want of it. An 
Irish officer said, " He was very easy about the 
matter, for he had nothing to do with water ; if he 
only got his tea in the morning, and punch at 
night, it was all that he wanted." 



DRESSING FOR COLD SLATT. 

590. Beat up two eggs ; add to it one 
gill of vinegar and water, mixed ; place it 
on the range; when it begins to thicken, 
stir in a piece of butter the size of a small 
walnut, a little salt, and a teaspoonful of 
sugar. When cold, pour it over the cab- 
bage ; stir it together, and before sending to 
table sprinkle with a little black pepper. 

ONE of the very best of all earthly possessions is 
self-possession. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 503 

CHEESE SANDWICHES. 

591. Take two parts of grated Parme- 
san cheese, one of butter, and a small pro- 
portion of made mustard ; pound them in a 
mortar ; cover slices of bread with a little 
of this, and lay over it slices of ham or any 
cured meat; cover with another slice of 
bread, press them together and cut into 
mouthfuls, that they may be lifted with a 
fork. 

WHY can't the captain of a vessel keep a memo- 
randum of the weight of his anchor, instead of

weighing it every time he leaves port. 



LEMON SHERBERT. 

592. Squeeze the juice out of six 
lemons, and take out all the pulp ; then 
pour two quarts of boiling milk and ten 
heaping tablespoonfuls of sifted sugar over 
the skins, and cover the whole very tightly. 
When cold, strain out the peel, pour the 



504 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

milk into the freezer, and when half frozen, 
add the lemon juice ; stir it well, and let it 
freeze. 

ICE IN INDIA. The method adopted by the In- 
dians to obtain ice, is very ingenious. They dig 
pits in the ground about two feet deep, which they 
line with dried sugar canes or Indian corn. On 
this they place very shallow dishes, made of un- 
glazed and porous earthenware, and filled with soft 
water that has been boiled. Thus they are de- 
posited in the evening, and in consequence of the 
evaporation from the outside of the dishes, a con- 
siderable portion of the water is found frozen next 
morning. The ice is collected before sunrise, and 
rammed into a cellar under ground, and lined with 
straw, where, owing to the accumulated cold, the 
ice freezes into a solid mass. 



PUNCH. 

593. Four pounds of sugar, one pint of 
lemon juice, one pint of Jamaica spirits, 
half a pint of peach brandy, half a pint of 
French brandy, five quarts of water. The 
quantity of liquor may be regulated accord- 
ing to the taste.

A TOPER was asked what he thought of the

effects of strong drink upon the system. " Hot

and coffee, for instance, undoubtedly hurtful; and

large quantities, if that be possible, migitt ulti- 
mately do harm I" 



SNOW PANCAKES AND PUDDINGS.-TH2T COST 
OF EGGS SAVED IN THE DEAREST SEASON. 

594. It is not generally known that 
snow is a good substitute for egg, in both 
puddings and pancakes. Two tablespoon- 
fuls may be taken as the equivalent of an 
egg. Take it from a clean spot, and the 
sooner it is used after it is taken in-door& 
the better. It is to be beaten in, just aa 
eggs are, and should be handled as little as 
possible. As eggs are dear in the season of 
snow, it is a help to economy to know the 
above. It is equivalent to a supply of fresh 
eggs. Powdered ice will answer as well as 
snow, when the latter cannot be obtained. 

" You can do any thing if you will only have pa- 
tience," said an old uncle who had made a fortune,, 
to a nephew who had nearly spent one. " Water

may be carried in a sieve, if you can only wait." 
" How long ?" asked the petulant spendthrift, who 
was impatient for the old man's obituary. His uncle 
coolly replied, ''Till it freezes /"

USE OF BONES IN COOKING. 

595. Crack the bones very small, and 
boil them in plenty of water for two or 
three hours, according to the quantity of 
bones. When the water is half boiled 
away, a very nutritious jelly will be ob- 
tained. Iron or porcelain lined vessels are 
the only proper kinds for this purpose. This 
jelly may be added to soup or gravy. 

EYES dry for their sins, are vainly wet for their 
sufferings ; a drought in the spring is not to be re- 
paired by a deluge in the autumn. 



HOME-MADE CAYENNE PEPPER. 

596. Remove the stalks of Chili pep- 
pers, and put the pods into a colander ; set it 
before the fire for about twelve hours, by 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 507 

which time they will be dry. Then pour 
them into a mortar, with one fourth their 
weight in salt, and pound and rub them till 
they are as fine as possible, sift through a 
little muslin, and then pound the residue, 
and sift again. 

A FARMER'S wife lately entered a druggist's shop, 
and handed him two prescriptions to be prepared, 
one for her husband and the other for her cow. 
Finding, however, that she had not sufficient cash 
to pay for both, she took away that for the cow, 
saying, "To-morrow will do for my husband." 



MAYONNAISE. 

597. Put into a large basin the yolks 
of two new laid eggs, with a little salt and 
Cayenne ; stir these well together, then add 
a teaspoonful of good salad oil, and work 
the mixture round until it appears like 
cream. Pour in, by slow degrees, nearly 
half pint of oil, continuing at each interval 
to work the sauce as at first, until it re- 
sumes the smoothness of cream, and not a 



508 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

particle of the oil remains visible ; then add 
two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, and 
one tablespoonful of cold water to whiten 
the sauce. 

PADDY, one day, being sent to count some pigs 
(the number being twenty), was asked by his mas- 
ter whether they were all right. He said, "Faith, 
and I counted nineteen, but one little beggar ran 
about so fast, I could not count him at all." 



A CHEAP METHOD OF OBTAINING A CON- 
STANT SUPPLY OF PURE VINEGAR. 

598. Take one gallon of water, half a 
pound of sugar, half a pound of molasses, 
and boil them together for twenty minutes ; 
when cool, add a teacupful of yeast; put 
the whole into a jar, and lay a vinegar 
plant on the surface of the liquor. Cover 
the jar with paper, keeping it in a warm 
place, and it will produce very good and 
wholesome vinegar in about six weeks. 

The vinegar plant is a minute fungus, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 509 

forming what is commonly called " the 
mother of vinegar." A bit of this thrown 
into the above liquid rapidly increases, and 
changes the sugar and water into vinegar. 
The plant will form of itself in the first in- 
stance, but this will require a longer time. 
Afterward it may be divided and trans- 
ferred to other quantities of the mixture, to 
accelerate the process of vinegar making. 

THERE is a story extant of a young wag who was 
invited to dine with a gentleman of rather sudden 
temper. The dining-room was on the second floor, 
and the principal dish was a fine roast fowl. When 
the old gentleman undertook to carve it, he found 
the knife rather dull, and, in a sudden passion, flung 
it down stairs after the servant. Whereupon the 
young man seized the fowl, and with admirable 
dexterity, hurried it after the knife. " What on 
earth do you mean ?' exclaimed the old gentleman. 
" I beg your pardon !" was the cool reply, "I thought 
you were going to dine down stairs." 



TO OBTAIN MINT SAUCE AT ANY SEASON OF 

THE YEAR, 

599. When mint is green and plentiful, 
cut it up fine, and put it into bottles. Fill the 



510 THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 

bottles with vinegar, and cork closely. The 
sugar can be added when required for use. 
No one can tell the difference of mint so 
prepared from that newly gathered from 
the bed. 

For those who like mint sauce, the above 
may be eaten with lamb or mutton chops. 

IN attempting to carve a fowl, one day, a West- 
ern settler found considerable difficulty in sepa- 
rating its joints, and exclaimed against the man who 
had sold him an old hen for a chicken. " My dear," 
said the enraged man's wife, " don't talk so much 
against the aged and respectable Mr. B. ; he sowed 
the first patch of corn that was planted in our set- 
tlement." " I know that," was the reply, " and 
/ believe this old hen scratched it up /" 



MILK PORRIDGE, 

600. Boil some grits very thoroughly. 
When cold, pour over rich milk ; or, the 
grits may be warmed up in milk and served 
hot. This makes a very wholesome dish 
for children. 



THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 511 
TO PRESERVE EGGS. 

601. Eggs should not be more than 
twenty-four hours old when they are stored. 
They may be kept several Aveeks by putting 
them in a jar of salt or lime water with the 
small end downwards. They may be kept 
for a long time by greasing them well with 
melted mutton suet, and placing them in a 
bin of bran, with their small end down- 
wards. Another way of keeping them 
fresh is to pour a gallon of boiling water on 
two quarts of quick lime, and a half pound 
of salt ; when cold, mix with an ounce of 
cream of tartar. Stir all well together, put 
the eggs in, and see that there is enough 
liquor to cover them. 



Customer. " I wish to purchase some eggs to 
make a sponge cake ; they must be very fresh." 

Shopkeeper. "Ah, yes! I have some that can't 
be beaten." 

Customer. " Can't be beaten !" 

Shopkeeper. " No, ma'am, I defy any one to beat 
them." 

Customer. " Then they won't do for me ; how 
can eggs be made into a sponge cake, unless they 
can be beaten ?" 



512 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

RICE FLUMMERY. 

602. Mix two tablespoonfuls of rice 
flour with a little cold milk, and add to it a 
pint of boiled milk, sweetened and flavored 
with -cinnamon and lemon peel. Boil this, 
stirraig it constantly, and when sufficiently 
thick, pour it into a mould. When cold, 
turn It out and serve it with thick cream, 
or thin custard around it. 

A TERSON complaining of the smallness of some 
chops brought to table, an incorrigible wag observed 
that " Probably the sheep was fed upon short com- 
mons J*' 



POTATO YEAST. 

603. Boil a quarter of a peck of 
potatoes ; mash them fine, and thin them a 
little with the w r ater in which they have 
been boiled. Add some salt, and a table- 
spoonful of brown sugar. When lukewarm, 
in about half a pint or more of old 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 513 

yeast. Let it rise, then cover it closely 
and put it in a cool place. 



YEAST. 

604. Tie a large handful of hops in a 
thin bag, and boil them in three quarts of 
water. Moisten with cold water a sufficient 
quantity of flour, and stir in the hop-water 
while boiling hot. Add a handful of salt. 
Let it stand until it is about lukewarm, and 
then add about a pint of old yeast. When 
it is light, cover it, and stand it in a cool 
place. 



ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE YEAST. 

605. Tie a pint of hops in a thin bag, 
and boil them in three quarts of water. 
Add three tablespoonfuls of salt and two of 
molasses. Make a thin paste of flour and 

32 



514 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

cold water. Take out the hops and pour 
gradually the thin paste into the hop-water; 
then place it over the fire and let it boil a 
few minutes. Let it stand until it becomes 
lukewarm, add some old yeast, and as soon 
as it is light stand it away in a cool place. 

WE ask advice, but we mean approbation. 



YEAST POWDERS. 

606. Dissolve separately one drachm 
and a half of tartaric acid, and the same 
quantity of bi-carbonate of soda. First put 
the soda into your batter, or whatever you 
wish to make light, and lastly stir in the 
tartaric acid. 



HAM OMELETTE. 

607. Beat four eggs very light, and add 
to them as much grated ham as will flavor 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 515 

it, with salt and pepper to the taste. Fry 
it in hot butter till it is brown on the lower 
side. Serve it immediately. 

A WORTHY old farmer, residing in the vicinity of 
Mahopeck, was worried to death by unruly boarders. 
They found fault with his table, and said he had 
nothing fit to eat. " Hang it," said old Isaac, 
" what a fuss you're making, I can eat any thing." 
" Can you eat a crow, now?" said one of the board- 
ers. " Yes, I ken eat a crow." "Bet you a hat," 
said the guest. The bet was made, the crow 
shot, and roasted ; but, before serving it up they 
mischievously contrived to sprinkle it well with 
Scotch snuff. Isaac sat down to the crow. He 
took a good bite and began to chew away, but he 
made an awful face ; however, he persevered, and 
succeeded, and when he had finished, he said, with 
singular grimace. " You see I ken eat a crow, but 
I confess / shouldn't be inclined to hanker arter it /" 



CHEAP OMELETTE. 

608. If there are no social objections 
to your eating onions, try the following : 
Beat up the yolks of three eggs, add half of 
a good-sized onion, chopped very fine, and 
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. The 
shredding of the onion to a sufficient degree 



516 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of fineness is very important, as the short 
time required to fry the omelette would be 
sufficient to cook the onion. Have ready 
some butter or nice dripping, which should 
be boiling hot when the beaten egg is 
stirred in. It should be of a light brown 
on the under side. It may be browned on 
the top by holding the pan of the hot 
shovel over it. 

IT was remarked by an eminent barrister, that 
learning in ladies should be as onions properly are 
in cookery 3^011 should perceive the flavor, but not 
the thing itself. 



GREEN CORN OMELETTE. 

609. Take from four to six ears of 
green corn ; grate it off the cob ; add to this 
three eggs beaten light, salt and pepper to 
the taste. 

A SERVANT being sent to match a china plate, re- 
turned with one of a very different pattern. After 
scolding for some time, the mistress said, " Stupid, 
do you not see that the two are entirely different ?" 
"No mum," was the reply; "only one of 'em is 
different." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 517 

BAKED EGG OMELETTE. 

610. Two tablespoonfuls of flour, one 
pint of milk, and three eggs. Moisten the 
flour gradually with the milk, beat it very 
smooth, beat the eggs very light, and add 
them to the flour and milk; season with 
salt ; butter a pan, pour in the mixture ; 
bake in a quick oven about three quarters 
of an hour. 

BOSOM FRIEND. " Well, dear, now that you are a 
widow, tell me, are you any the happier for it ?" 

INTERESTING WIDOW. " Oh, no ! But I have my 
freedom, and that's a great comfort. Do you know, 
my dear, I had an onion yesterday, for the first 
time these fourteen years ?" 



MINCED MEAT. 

611. Five pounds of beef or tongue, 
two pounds of suet, seven pounds of sugar, 
seven pounds of apples, three pounds of 
raisins, three pounds of currants, three nut- 
megs, two ounces of cinnamon, a dessert 
spoonful of ground allspice, one small tea- 



518 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

spoonful of ground mace, the juice of two 
lemons, and the grated rind of one. Moisten 
it with equal portions of wine, and cider. 
Brandy to the taste. Boil the meat in 
water, which has been salted in the propor- 
tion of one teaspoonful of salt, to every 
quart of water. When it is tender, stand it 
away, to get perfectly cold, before it is 
chopped. Wash, pick, and dry your cur- 
rants, prepare the spices, and seed the 
raisins. Pare and core the apples, chop 
them fine, chop the meat very fine, add the 
fruit, sugar, and spice, lemon juice, and 
grated lemon rind, (also the brandy and 
wine.) Mix the whole thoroughly ; it will 
be fit for use on the following day. If you 
wish to keep your minced meat for several 
weeks, chop the meat, and add the currants, 
raisins, sugar, and spice, but leave out the 
apples, lemon, wine, and cider; mix the 
other ingredients, and merely moisten it 
with brandy ; pack the mixture tightly in a 
stone jar, and cover it close. When you 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 519 

wish to make it into pies, take out some of 
the meat, chop your apples, and mix with 
it in the proportion given above. Moisten 
with cider, and add wine and brandy to 
your taste. 

THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED IN DECEMBER. Be 
charitable to the poor, and be just to your connec- 
tions. Examine the state of your affairs, and pre- 
pare to improve your position by fresh energies. 
Take care of your health, not by reading the puffs 
of " quackery," and swallowing quack nostrums, 
but by exercising in fine weather, and by warmth 
a nome in foggy and damp days and nights. 



A NICE LUNCHEON OR SUPPER CAKE 
FROM COLD VEAL. 

612. Take as much cold roasted lean 
veal as will fill a small cake mould, and 
mince it fine, together with a slice of ham, 
a piece of the crumb of bread soaked in cold 
milk, two eggs well beaten, a small bit of 
butter, the same of onion ; season with pep- 
per and salt, and mix all well together; 
butter the mould; fill it, and bake in an 



520 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

oven for about an hour ; turn it out when 
cold, and cut into slices. Garnish with 
pickled eggs and parsley. 

BE not affronted at a jest ; if one throw salt at 
thee, thou wilt take no harm, unless thou hast sore 
places. 



BREAD JELLY, 

613. Cut the crumb of a roll into thin 
slices, and toast them equally of a pale 
brown ; boil them gently in water enough 
to rather more than cover them, till a jelly 
is produced, which may be known by put- 
ting a little in a spoon to cool ; strain it 
upon a piece of lemon peel, and sweeten to 
taste ; a little wine may be added. This is 
a light and pleasant repast for invalids. 



BEVERAGE FROM CHERRIES. 

614. To one pint of cherry juice, put 
one pound of sugar. Boil it ten minutes, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 521 

and skim it. When cool, bottle it, and 
cork it tight. 

A TOURIST stopping at a hotel saw on the hill of 
fare, " Fried Water Chicken." Desiring to know 
what this meant, he ordered a dish, and finding it 
excellent, recommended it to the rest of his party, 
ladies and all. They liked the dish wonderfully, 
and became frog-eaters without knowing it. 



A NICE PIE OF COLD VEAL, OR CHICKEM, 

AND HAM. 

615. Lay the crust into a shallow pie- 
dish, and fill it with the meat, prepared as 
follows : Shred cold veal or fowl, and half 
the quantity of ham, mostly lean ; put to it 
a little cream ; season with pepper, a little 
nutmeg, and a bit of garlic; cover with 
crust, and turn it out of the dish when 
baked. 

WE are but farmers of ourselves ; yet may, 
If we can stock ourselves and thrive, display 
Much good treasure for the great rent day. 



522 THE YOUXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

BOTTLING WINE. 

616. The first thing to be attended to 
is the choice of good cosks ; they should be 
perfectly new, well cut, and flexible ; any 
having black spots on them should be 
rejected. When the wine runs clear, place 
a shallow tub under the tap of the cask, 
and take care that there are two or three 
small holes near the bung or in it, to allow 
the air an ingress, to supply the place of 
the wine withdrawn. All being ready, 
hold the bottle under the tap in a leaning 
position. Fill the bottle to within two 
inches of the top of the neck, so that when 
the cork comes in, there may remain three- 
quarters of an inch of space between the 
wine and the lower end of the cork. The 
corks should be dipped, not soaked, in wine, 
and should enter with difficulty; they are 
driven in with a wooden mallet. If the 
cork is to be waxed, it must be cut off to 
less than a quarter of an inch. Champagne 
bottles must have their corks driven about 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 523 

half way, and fixed down by a wire, this 
makes them easy to draw. While a cask 
of wine is bottling off, it is impossible to 
exclude the admission of air to the surface 
of the liquor, except some particular method 
is employed, and if the operation lasts 
some time, the wine is almost certain to be 
injured ; the best prevention of this, is a 
bottle of fine olive oil, which, being poured 
into the cask and floating on the surface of 
the wine, totally excludes the air, and pre- 
vents acidity or mouldiness for a whole 
year. When the crust, or precipitation of 
wine in bottles, is deposited in excess, and 
is about to be removed, the wine should be 
decanted into fresh bottles, or the deposit 
may mix with and injure the wine. Wine 
to be fit for bottling must not only be 
separated from the gross lees, and have 
attained perfect clearness by the fining, but 
it must also remain a certain time in the 
cask to ripen ; for this no precise rule can 
be laid down. Generally speaking, how- 



524 THE YOUNG WIFE*S COOK BOOK. 

ever, wine should not be bottled until it has 
lost its sharpness, and is no longer liable to 
fermentation. When wine is bottled too 
soon, it often ferments and remains always 
sharp ; the best time to perform this opera- 
tion is in the month of March or October, 
especially if the weather be fine and clear. 

"THAT was a severe coughing fit," said the sex- 
ton to the undertaker, while they were taking a 
glass together. " Oh, 'tis nothing but a little ale 
which went the wrong way." " Ah, ha ! that's just 
like you," replied the sexton, "you always lay the 
coffin on the bier !" 



CHICKEN CUERY. 

617. Remove the skin from a chicken, 
cut it up, and roll each piece in curry 
powder and flour mixed together (a table- 
spoonful of flour to half an ounce of curry). 
Fry two or three sliced onions in butter, 
when of a light brown put in the chicken, 
and fry them together till the chicken 
becomes brown, then stew them together in 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 525 

a little water for two or three hours. More 
water may be added if too thick. 

Do nothing in a passion ; why wilt thou put to 
sea in the violence of a storm ? 



EGG-NOG. 

618. Six eggs, one pint of milk, half a 
pound of loaf sugar, half a pint of brandy. 
Beat the eggs very light and thick, add the 
milk, sugar and brandy. 

PHILIP, king of Macedon, having drank too much 
wine, happened to determine a cause unjustly to the 
prejudice of a poor widow, who, when she heard his 
decree, boldly cried out, " I appeal to Philip sober." 
The king, struck with the peculiarity of the event, 
recovered his senses, heard the cause afresh, and, 
finding his mistake, ordered her to be paid out of 
his own purse, double the sum she was to have lost. 
This is an example worthy of imitation. 



TO ROAST COFFEE. 

619. Pick the black or imperfect 
grains from the coffee. Put it in a pan, 
and stir it all the time it is roasting ; when 



526 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

done, it should be the color of the hull 
of a ripe chestnut. It should be brown all 
through, but not black. About ten minutes 
before it is done, add to two pounds of 
coffee, half an ounce of butter. Whilst hot, 
put it in a box, and cover it closely. 

NOTICE of coffee, from Sir H. Blunt's travels in 
1534. "They (the Turks) have another drink, 
called cauphe, made of a berry as big as a small 
bean, dried in a furnace and beat to a powder, of a 
sooty color, that they seethe and drink, in taste, a 
little bitterish, but as may be endured it is thought 
to be the old black broth, used so much by the 
Lacedemonians ; it drietb ill humors in the stomach, 
comforteth the brain, etc." 



USES FOR STALE BREAD. 

020. Stale bread may be cut into 
slices, and softened, by pouring a small 
quantity of boiling water over it. Cover 
the pan containing it, to prevent the escape 
of the steam. As soon as the bread is soft, 
season the slices with pepper and salt, have 
some hot lard, ham fat, or sausage dripping, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 527 

in a pan, dust a little flour, or Indian meal 
on each slice, and fry them a delicate 
brown. Boiling milk, if you have it, is bet- 
ter than water to soften the bread. 



ANOTHER WAY TO USE STALE BREAD 

621. Rub the bread crumbs fine, pour 
enough hot milk over them to moisten 
them. Let them stand until they are 
quite soft. Beat up one egg, very light, to 
every pint of crumbs. Add the egg to the 
bread, and beat the whole till very smooth ; 
add a little salt, and enough yeast to raise 
the batter. When light, bake it on a 
griddle like buckwheat cakes. 



ANOTHER USE FOR STALE BREAD. 

622. Soak some bread in cold milk, 
drain the milk off, mash the bread very fine 



528 THE YOFXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

and mix with it n quarter of a pound of 
boiled rice. Beat up two eggs light, add a 
little salt, mix all together thoroughly, and 
boil it in a bag for an hour. Serve it with 
any kind of sweet sauce. 

" PAPA, I've been seeing cook make bread ; and 
can you tell me why dough resembles the sun ?" 
" The sun, Freddy ?"' " Yes, Pa." " No, I cannot.' 1 
Freddy, with great glee, " Because, when it rises iVa 
light." 



PANCAKES WITHOUT EGGS, 

623. Mix four tablespoonfuls of dried 
flour with a pint of mild ale ; beat the bat- 
ter for a quarter of an hour. Dissolve half 
an ounce of fresh dripping, or lard, in a 
small frying-pan, pour in a fourth part of 
the batter, and fry both sides a pale brown 
color. Place the pancakes one on the other 
with a dessertspoonful of moist sugar sprink- 
led between. Each pancake requires half 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 529 

an ounce of dripping, and ten minutes to 
fry. 

A SAD CASE. We were visiting; at the house of a 

Cj 

friend, where there were a number of young chil- 
dren. One of them had the measles, one the hooping 
cough. They were all receiving the greatest S3 7 mpa- 
thy and attention, while one little girl, about five 
years old. sat in the corner, crying bitterly. We 
asked her what was the matter ? She replied, burst- 
ing out into a heart-breaking gush of tears. " Every 
one has got the measles and hooping cough, and I 
ain't got nothing, boo ! hoo hoo I" 



CARAMELS. 

624. One cup of grated chocolate, one 
cup of milk, one cup of molasses, a piece of 
butter the size of an egg, one cup of sugar. 

BEING AT HOME.- -The highest style of being at 
home grows out of a special state of the affections 
rather than of the intellect. Who has not met with 
individuals whose faces would be a passport to any 
society, and whose manners, the unstudied and 
spontaneous expressions of their inner selves, make 
them visibly welcome wherever they go, and attract 
unbounded confidence toward them in whatever 
they undertake ? The} r are frank, because they have 
nothing to conceal ; affable, because their natures 
overflow with benevolence ; unflurried, because they 
dread nothing; always at home, because they carry 
33 



530 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

within themselves that which can trust to itself any- 
where and everywhere purity of soul with fulness 
of health. Such are our best guarantees for feeling 
at home in all society to which duty takes us, and in 
every occupation upon which it obliges us to enter. 
The} 7 who live least for themselves are also the least 
embarrassed by uncertainties. 



CAKES MADE OF COLD MEAT OR POULTRY. 

625. Take any cold poultry, or meat, 
and mince it fine ; season with pepper and 
salt, to the taste ; mix thoroughly, and 
make into small cakes, with bread crumbs, 
and yolks of boiled eggs, or any of the 
forcemeats. Fry the cakes a light brown, 
and serve them hot. 

" IT seems," said one dandy to another, at a party, 
" that they give no supper to night." To which the 
other coolly replied, " Then I stop my expenses," 
and coolly took off his new gloves 1 



NEW ENGLAND BROWN BREAD. 

626. Take equal quantities of Indian 
meal and rye flour, scald the Indian meal, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 531 

and when lukewarm, add the rye flour. 
Stir in enough lukewarm water to form a 
dough a little softer than for wheat bread. 
Add half a pint of good yeast and half a 
teacup of molasses. When it has risen, 
bake it well in a moderate oven. 



SODA BREAD. 

627. Three pints of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful of 
bicarbonate of soda, dissolved in half a tea- 
cup of warm water. Rub the cream of tar- 
tar in the flour, add a little salt, and stir in 
gradually some sweet milk and the soda, 
so as to form a dough. Mould it out into 
loaves, and bake in a moderate oven, so as 
to let it rise. It requires about three-quar- 
ters of an hour to bake, and should be a 
light brown. 



532 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

MUSH BREAD. 

628. Boil some Indian mush in the 
usual way, and when lukewarm add to it 
some salt, yeast and enough wheat flour to 
form a soft dough. Let it rise; when light, 
knead it with only enough flour to prevent 
it adhering to the board. Make it into 
loaves, put them in the pans, let them rise 
again, and bake them. This is a more 
economical bread than that made with 
wheat. 



CORN BREAD. 

629. To two quarts of meal add one 
pint of bread sponge ; water sufficient to 
wet the whole ; add half a pint of flour and 
a tablespoonful of salt; let it rise; then 
knead well for the second time, and place 
the dough in the oven, and allow it to bake 
an hour and a half. 

AN industrious peasant in Picardy, being observed 
to purchase weekly live loaves, was asked what oc- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 533 

casion he could possibly have for so much bread. 
"One," replied the honest fellow, "is for myself; 
one I give away ; one I return, and the other two I 
lend." " How do you make that out ?" " Why," 
returned the peasant, " the one which I take myself 
is for my own use ; the second, which I give away, 
is for my mother in law ; the loaf I return, is for my 
father ; and the other two, which I lend, are those 
with which I keep my two children, in hopes that 
they will one day return them to me." 



MILK BREAD. 

630. Procure good yeast, put it into 
your flour with sufficient salt. Warm the 
milk, add to it half a teaspoonful of bi-car- 
bonate of soda, and knead the dough for 
three quarters of an hour. Let it rise very 
light, then knead it again fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Place it in your bread pans and 
bake it in a moderate oven without letting 
it rise the second time. 

A SQUIRE had a friend to visit him on business, 
and was very much annoyed when his wife came to 
ask him what he wanted for dinner. " Go away! 
let us alone ;" impatiently said the squire. Business 
detained his friend till dinner time, and the squire 
urged him to remain. To the surprise of both, they 



534 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

saw nothing but a huge bowl of salad, which the 
good wife began quietly to serve up. " My dear," 
said the squire, " where are the meats ?" "You didn't 
order an}'," coolly answered the housewife. " I 
asked what you would have, and you said, 'Lettuce 
alone !' Here it is." The friend burst into a laugh, 
and the squire, after looking lurid for a moment, 
joined him. " Wife, I give it up. Here is the 
money you wanted for that carpet which I denied 
you. Now let's have peace, and some dinner." The 
good woman pocketed the money, rang the bell, and 
a sumptuous repast was brought in. 



BREAD FRITTERS, 

631. Strew half a pound of currants on 
a dish, and dredge them well with flour; 
grate some bread into a pan until a pint of 
crumbs is produced ; pour over them a pint 
of boiling milk, in which two ounces of 
butter have been stirred ; cover the pan and 
let it stand for an hour. Then beat the 
mixture thoroughly, and add half a nutmeg 
grated, a quarter of a pound of white 
powdered sugar, and a wineglassful of 
brandy. Beat six eggs till very light, and 
stir them by degrees into the mixture. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 535 

Lastly, add the currants, a few at a time, 
and mix the whole, thoroughly. It should 
be brought to the consistence of a thin 
batter, and if it turns out too thin, add a 
little flour. Have ready a heated frying- 
pan with boiling lard. Put in the batter in 
large spoonfuls, and fry the fritters to a 
light brown. Drain them on a perforated 
skimmer, or an inverted sieve placed in a 
deep pan, and send them to the table hot. 
Serve with wine and powdered sugar. 



GERMAN PUFFS, 

632. One pint of milk, three eggs, one 
pound of flour, one dessertspoonful of dis- 
solved salgeratus, a teaspoonful of butter, a 
saltspoon of salt. Beat the whites of the 
eggs, separately. The yolks must be as 
thick as batter, and the whites perfectly 
dry. Add to the yolks half the milk and 
half the flour, stir it well until the batter is 



536 THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 

smooth, then add the remainder of the flour 
and milk. Warm the butter, and stir in 
and beat the batter thus made, till it is 
light and full of bubbles. Stir in the salae- 
ratus, and lastly, the whites but do not 
beat it after the whites have been added, as 
that will make it tough. Butter teacups, 
or an earthen mould, pour in the batter, 
and bake it in a moderate oven. Serve 
with butter and sugar, or any kind of sauce 
which may be preferred. They require 
from half an hour to three quarters to bake. 

A VAIN hope flattereth the heart of a fool ; but he 
that is wise pursueth it not. 



POTATO PUFFS. 

633. Dissolve two ounces of loaf sugar 
in a wineglassful of new milk ; rub three 
ounces of mealy potato (boiled) to fine 
powder; mix these together; add the grated 
rind of a small lemon and the yolks of three 
fresh eggs ; beat for ten minutes ; then add 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 587 

the whites, beaten to a froth ; butter five 
small tin moulds ; put a fifth part of the 
mixture into each, and bake in a quick 
oven about eighteen minutes. Serve imme- 
diately, with sugar sifted over them. 

THIS instant is thine, the next, is in the womb of 
futurity, and thou knowest not what it may bring 
forth. 



A CHARTREUSE OF APPLE AND RICE. 

634. Boil six ounces of rice, with a 
stick of cinnamon, in milk until it is thick, 
stirring in a spoonful of rose water or 
orange flower water. Pare ten or twelve 
apples golden pippins are the best scoop 
out the core, and fill up the orifice with 
raspberry jam. Border a deep dish with 
paste; put in the apples, leaving a space 
between, and fill it up with rice. Brush 
the whole over with the yolk of an egg, 
and sift sugar thickly over it ; form a 



538 THE YOUNG WIPES COOK BOOK. 

pattern on top with sweatmeats, and bake 
it for one hour in a quick oven. 

INFLUENCE OF LIGHT UPON THE HUMAN CONSTITU- 
TION. Dupuytren, the French physician, relates 
the case of a lady whose maladies had baffled the 
skill of several eminent practitioners. The lady re- 
sided in a dark room, into which the sun never 
shone, in one of the narrow streets of Paris. After 
a careful examination, Dupii} r tren was led to refer 
her complaints to the absence of light, and recom- 
mended her removal to a more cheerful situation. 
This change was followed by the most beneficial re- 
sults, and all her complaints vanished. Sir James 
Wylie has given a remarkable instance of the influ- 
ence of light. He states that the cases of disease 
on the dark side of a barrack at St. Petersburg have 
been uniformly, for many years, in the proportion 
of three to one to those on the side exposed to 
strong light. The experiments of Dr. Edwards are 
conclusive. He has shown that if tadpoles are 
nourished with proper food, and exposed to the 
constantly renewed contact of water (so that their 
beneficial respiration may be maintained), but are 
entirely deprived of light, their growth continues, 
but their metamorphosis into the condition of air- 
breathing animals is arrested, and they remain in 
the form of large tadpoles. Dr. Edwards also ob- 
serves that persons who live in caves or cellars, or 
in very dark and narrow streets are apt to produce 
deformed children ; and that men who work in 
mines are liable to disease, which can only be attri- 
buted to the withdrawal of the blessings of light.

HOUSEWIFERY. 

WASHING. 

635. All the water used for washing 
must be soft, otherwise the clothes cannot 
be made clean. Soap, instead of dissolving 
and forming suds, will always curdle and 
float on the surface of water that is either 
hard from being impregnated with lime or 
other mineral substances, or brackish from 
its vicinity to the sea. The best way of 
softening hard water is to mix with it a 
large quantity of strong lye, in the propor- 
tion of one gallon of lye to three or four of 
water. Soda is sometimes used, but it is 
objectionable as it injures the texture of the 
clothes. 

Where all the water is hard it is usual to 
save rain water by catching it in cisterns, 
or casks placed under the water spouts. 
Kain water casks should always have 
covers to prevent impurities from getting 
into the water. They should stand on feet 



540 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK 

and be furnished with a spigot for drawing 
the water when wanted. Without an abun- 
dance of water it is impossible to wash the 
clothes clean, or to make them a good color, 
and where a sufficiency can be obtained, no 
good washer will be sparing in the use of it. 
Washing in dirty suds is of very little avail. 

In using soda in washing, the best 
method is to boil three quarters of a pound 
of soap and an ounce of soda in a gallon of 
water till they are completely dissolved, 
then pour the liquid out to be used at once. 

The bleaching of linen or muslin is best 
effected by first washing the articles in cool 
soap suds, and laying them on the grass at 
night to receive the dew; repeat this pro- 
cess for a few days. 



TO WASH A COUNTERPANE. 

636. Rub it well with soap, and put it 
over night in a tub of lukewarm water. 
Next morning, wash it out of the water it 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 541 

was soaked in, then wring it out and wash 
it in some clean soap suds; after which 
wash it through a second sud warmer than 
the first. Rinse it twice through plenty of 
cold water. The last rinse water should 
have a little blue in it. Wring the counter- 
pane out, hang it in the sun to dry, wrong 
side outward. Take it in toward evening 
and the next day hang it with the right 
side out. It must on no account be put 
away with the slightest dampness about it. 
It may take three days to dry perfectly. 
In washing a quilt or counterpane never 
use soda. 



TO WASH COLORED DRESSES. 



637. Have ready plenty of clean, soft 
water. It spoils colored clothes to wash 
them in the dirty suds the white clothes 
have boen washed in. The water should 
be warm, but by no means hot, as that 



542 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

would injure the colors. Rub enough soap 
in the water to make a strong lather before 
the chintz is put into it. Wash it tho- 
roughly; then wash it in a second clean 
warm suds, and rinse it well. Have ready 
a pan filled with weak starch, tinged with a 
little blue. Painted lawns or muslins will 
be much improved by mixing a little gum 
arabic water with the starch ; for instance, 
a tablespoonful. Put the dress into it, and 
run it through the starch. Then squeeze it 
out, open it well, clap it, and hang it out 
immediately to dry in the shade ; taking 
the sleeve by the cuffs and pinning them up 
to the skirt, so as to spread them wide, and 
causing them to dry the sooner. If colored 
clothes continue wet too long,, no precaution 
can prevent the colors from running into 
streaks. This will certainly happen if they 
are allowed to lie in the water. They 
must always be done as fast as possible, till 
the whole process is completed. If the 
colors are once injured, nothing can restore 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 543 

them ; but by good management they may 
always be preserved ; unless in coarse low 
priced calicoes, and many of them wash per- 
fectly well. As soon as the dress is quite 
dry, take it in. It is always the best way 
to fold and iron it immediately. Another 
way of fixing the colors in a dress is to grate 
raw potato into the water in which the 
dress is washed. If dresses are to be put 
by for the winter season, they should 
always be washed and dried, but not 
starched nor ironed. They should be 
rolled up closely in a towel. 



TO WASH A BOOK MUSLIN DRESS, 

638. Make a strong suds with white 
soap and warm water. Put in the dress 
and wash it well; squeezing and pressing 
rather than rubbing it; as book muslin 
tears easily, and, without great care, will not 
last long. Wash it through a second suds, 



544 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

and then pass it through two rinsing 
waters ; adding a very little blue to the last. 
Then open out the dress ; and while wet, 
run it through a thin starch, diluted with 
water either warm or cold. Stretch it, and 
hang it in the sun to dry. Afterward, 
sprinkle it and roll it up in a clean fine 
towel, letting it lie for half an hour or more. 
Then open it out, stretch it even, and clap 
it in your hands till clear all over. Have 
irons ready, and iron it before it is too dry 
on the wrong side, whenever practicable. 
Take care that the irons are not too hot, as 
it will scorch easily. When done, do not 
fold the dress, but hang it up in a press or 
wardrobe. In ironing, be very careful to 
get the hem even. Many persons, previous 
to having them washed, rip out the hems 
of their thin muslin dresses, afterward run- 
ning them over again. This is a good plan, 
if you are willing to take the trouble. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 545 
TO MAKE WASHING FLUID. 

639. Add one pound of unslaked lime, 
to three gallons of soft, boiling water. Let 
it settle and pour off. Then add three 
pounds of washing soda, arid mix with the 
lime water. When dissolved, use a large 
wineglassful to each pailful of water. Add 
one gill of soft soap to a pailful of water. 



TO PREPARE STARCH. 

640. Put two or three tablespoonfuls 
of starch into a bowl, and mix it gradually, 
with just enough of clear cold water to con- 
vert it into a thin paste, pressing out all the 
lumps with the back of the spoon till it 
becomes perfectly smooth ; then pour it into 
a clean pipkin or skillet. Have ready a 
kettle of boiling water, and by degrees add 
some of it to the starch, stirring it well. 
A pint or a quart of the hot water may 
be allowed, according as it is desired that 

34 



546 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK 

the starch should be thick, thin, or of a 
moderate consistence. Set it on hot coals 
and boil it thoroughly for half an hour. If 
not well boiled, it will fail to be glutinous. 
When it has boiled for about fifteen 
minutes, stir it a few times, for a moment 
each time, with the end of a spermaceti 
candle. This will prevent it becoming 
sticky. If a spermaceti candle is not at 
hand, sprinkle in a little salt, about a tea- 
spoonful to a pint of starch or throw in a 
piece of loaf sugar. Finish by stirring it 
vigorously with a spoon. Strain the starch 
through a white cloth into a large pan, and 
squeeze into it a very little blue from the 
indigo bag ; but it must be very little. 



TO PREPARE COMMON STARCH. 

641. Put a sufficient quantity of dry 
starch (for instance, from two to three table- 
spoonfuls) into a bowl ; and mix it gradually 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 547 

with just enough of clear cold water to 
make it a thin paste, pressing out all the 
lumps with the back of the spoon till you 
get it perfectly smooth. Then pour it into 
a clean pipkin or skillet. Have ready a 
kettle of boiling water, and by degrees add 
some of it to the starch, stirring it well. 
You may allow from a pint to a quart of the 
hot water, according as you wish to have 
the starch thick, thin, or moderate. Set it 
on the fire, and boil it well for half an hour. 
If not well boiled, it will not be glutinous. 
When it has boiled about fifteen minutes, 
stir it a few times (merely for a moment 
each time) with the end of a spermaceti 
candle. This will prevent its being sticky ; 
but take care not to stir it too much. If 
you have no spermaceti, sprinkle in a little 
salt (about a teaspoonful to a pint of 
starch), which will answer a similar purpose, 
or throw in a lump of loaf sugar. Finish 
by stirring it hard with a spoon. 

Strain the starch through a white cloth 



548 THE YOUNG TTTFF/S COOK BOOK. 

into a large pan, and squeeze into it a little 
blue from the indigo bag. 

For common colored dresses you may 
make the starch with fine flour mixed as 
above. 

Gentlemen's collars should be quite dry 
before they are starched. Dip them into 
warm starch and let them dry again per- 
fectly. They must then be dipped into 
cold water, spread out smoothly on a clean 
towel and rolled up tightly. If the starch 
is properly prepared and the above rules 
adhered to, the linen will have a fine gloss 
when ironed. 



STIFFNESS TO COLLARS. 

642. A little gum arabic and common 
soda, added to the starch, gives extreme 
stiffness and gloss to collars. 

AN INQUIRY. " Father," said a little boy, the 
other da.y, " are not sailors very small men ?" " No, 
my dear," replied the father, " pray, what leads you 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 549 

to suppose they are so small ?" " Because," replied 
the child, "I read the other day of a sailor going to 
sleep in his watch." 



RULES IN REGARD TO IRONING, 

643. Be careful in ironing lace, ribbons, 
or any long, narrow strips, not to stretch 
them crooked, but iron them slowly, 
straight, and evenly ; and with the point 
of the iron press out every scallop sepa- 
rately. Needlework should always be ironed 
on the wrong side. In ironing collars, care 
should be taken not to stretch one half the 
collar more than the other They should 
be ironed first lengthways, then crossways. 
Sheets and table-cloths should be ironed 
with a large iron pressed on them heavily. 

All colored clothes require a cooler iron 
than white clothes, as too great heat is 
liable to injure the colors. Chintz should 
be ironed on the wrong side, as the starch 
is apt to show on colored clothing when 
ironed on the right side. 



550 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

When ironing a dress, if the table is not 
large enough, set a chair in a convenient 
place to receive the sleeves, or any part 
which may hang down, so as not to let them 
touch the floor. First iron the body, next 
the sleeves, and lastly the skirt. A skirt 
board should be made wide at the bottom 
gradually narrowing toward the top. Cover 
it first with a piece of blanket, and then 
with coarse muslin ; both of which must 
be sewed over it tightly and smoothly. 
This board is to slip into the skirt of a dress, 
which may thus be ironed without a crease. 
Puffings or gatherings should be folded or 
creased in half along the middle, and ironed 
out like a flounce or ruffle. 

In ironing a shirt, begin at the bosom, 
then iron the sleeves, and lastly the back. 
A small board, covered like that used for 
dresses, will be found very useful to slip 
under the bosoms of shirts when ironing 
them. 



TPIE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 551 

TO CLEAN GOLD ORNAMENTS. 
644. Make a lather of soap and water, 
and was^i the articles; then lay them in 
dry powdered magnesia. When dry, rub 
them with a piece of flannel ; or, if embossed, 
use a brush. Or the articles may be washed 
in soapsuds, and while wet, put them in a 
bag with some clean fresh bran, or sawdust; 
shake them, and they will look almost like 
new. 

THE following story is told of a Yankee captain 
and his mate : Whenever there was a plum pud- 
ding made by the captain's orders, all the plums 
were put into one end of it, and that placed next 
the captain, who after helping himself, passed it to 
the mate, who never found any plums in any part 
of it. After this game had been played for some 
time, the mate prevailed on the steward to place the 
suet-end next to the captain, who no sooner perceived 
the alteration than picking up the dish, and turning- 
it round, as if to examine the china, he said, " This 
cost me two shillings in Liverpool," and putting it 
down as if without design, with the plum-end next 
to himself. " Is it possible ?" said the mate, taking 
up the dish. " I shouldn't suppose it was worth 
more than a shilling ;" and, as if in perfect innocence, 
he put it down the contrary way. The captain looked 
at the mate ; the mate looked at the captain, and 
both laughed. "I'll tell you what, young'n," said 
the captain, " you've found me out ; so we'll just cut 
the pudding lengthwise this time, and have the 
plums fairly distributed hereafter." 



552 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

PASTE FOR CLEANING PLATE. 

645. Break up two cakes of whiting, 
into three pints of cold water, stir it well, 
so as to wash out all the grit, then let it 
stand till it settles to the bottom ; pour off 
the water, and put the whiting into the 
oven to dry. Scrape off the sandy sediment. 
Dissolve three quarters of a pound of soft 
soap ; mix half of the w r hiting into it ; add 
three quarters of a gill of spirits of wine ; 
stir till in a soft paste, then put it into 
covered pots ; the rest of the whiting to be 
kept in a lump for polishing. 

YET be not puffed np in thine own conceit, neither 
boast of superior understanding ; the dearest of 
human knowledge is but blindness and folly. 



TO TAKE STAINS OUT OF SILVER. 

646. Steep the silver in soap ley for 
the space of four hours ; then cover it over 
with whiting, wet with vinegar, so that it 
may lie thick upon it, and dry it by a fire ; 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 553 

after which rub off the whiting, and pass it 
over with dry bran, and the spots will not 
only disappear, but the silver will look ex- 
ceedingly bright. 



TO REMOVE INK STAINS FROM SILVER. 

647. The tops and other portions of 
silver ink-stands frequently become deeply 
discolored with ink, which is difficult to re- 
move by ordinary means. It may, how- 
ever, be completely eradicated by making a 
little chloride of lime into a paste with 
water, and rubbing it upon the stains. 

AN hour's industry will do more to beget cheer- 
fulness, suppress evil humors, and retrieve your 
affairs, than a month's moaning. 



TO CLEAN SILVER WARE, 

648. The most common method of 
cleaning silver, is with pulverized whiting 



554 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

and whisky, or with spirits of wine, which 
is better ; the whiting must be made as fine 
as possible, for if there are any coarse or 
rough particles among it, they will scratch 
the silver ; you may powder it very finely, 
either by pounding it in a mortar, or by 
tying it up in a clean rag, and beating it 
with a hammer, after which, spread it 
thinly over a large plate, and place it before 
the fire to dry, then sift it through a piece 
of coarse book-muslin or leno, mix the 
whiting into a paste or cream, with whisky 
or spirits of wine, dip a flannel or sponge 
into it, and coat the silver all over with the 
mixture, after which, lay all the articles in 
the sun to dry, or place them on an old 
waiter before the fire, but not very near it ; 
the paste must become so dry on the articles 
that you may dust it off them like flour, 
with a soft cloth, afterwards, with the 
smallest brush, rub between the prongs of 
the forks, and go over all the minute or 
delicate parts of the silver ; the plain or un- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 555 

ornamented parts are best rubbed with 
flannel, as they show the most trifling 
scratches ; next polish with a buckskin or a 
chamois leather, and finish with a soft silk 
handkerchief; before you begin to clean 
your plate, wash it in boiling water, that no 
grease or syrup may remain on it. 

NOTHING so much vexes a surgeon as to be sent for 
in great haste, and to find after his arrival that 
nothing, or next to nothing, is the matter with his 
patient. We read of an " urgent case" of this kind 
recorded of an eminent surgeon. He had been sent 
for by a gentleman who had just received a slight 
wound, and gave his servant orders to go home with 
all haste imaginable, and fetch a certain plaster 
The patient, turning a little pale, said ; " Heaven, 
sir, I hope there is no danger !" " Indeed there is," 
answered the surgeon ; " for if the fellow doesn't 
run like a race-horse the wound will be healed be- 
fore he can possibly get back!" 



ANOTHER MODE OF CLEANING SILVER. 

649. Silver door-plates are most ex- 
peditiously cleaned with a weak solution of 
ammonia and water, say, one teaspoonful of 
ammonia to one teacup of water, applied 



556 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

with a wet rag ; it is equally useful in clean- 
ing other silver plate and gold jewelry. 

MR. lives in street. His wife, who is an 

economical body, had sent a silk gown to a French 
dyer. The dyer called to ask for some further in- 
structions than those he had received, when, as 
it happened, he met the husband of the lady at 
the door. "Is madam within ?" asked the French- 
man, with an emphatic gesticulation. " And sup- 
pose she is, what do you want with her?" " Oh! 1 
am dying for her, sare /" " What I you dying for 
my wife ! get out of my house, you scoundrel I" He 
had just raised his foot to kick monsieur into the 
street, when the timely appearance of the lady led 
to the necessary explanation. 



TO CLEAN BLOCK TIN DISH-COVERS, Etc. 

650. Having washed the block tin 
articles quite clean in warm water, rub the 
inside with soft rags moistened with fine 
wet whiting. Then take a soft linen cloth, 
and go over the outside with a little sweet 
oil. Next rub it all over with fine whiting, 
powdered and sifted and put on dry. 
Afterward finish with a clean dry cloth. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 557 

Block tin dish covers cleaned in this way 
with oil and whiting will preserve their 
polish, and continue to look new, provided 
that they are always wiped dry as soon 
as they are brought from the table. Block 
tin pans and kettles may be cleaned with 
fine whiting and water, inside and outside. 

WHY should not a child's fancy in the way of food 
we refer to its intense dislike of certain things 
be regarded, as well as the repugnance of an adult ? 
We consider it a great piece of cruelty to force a 
child to eat things that are repulsive to it, because 
somebody once wrote a wise saw to the effect, " that 
children should eat whatever is set before them." 
We have often seen the poor little victims shudder 
and choke at the sisrht of a bit of fat meat, or a little 

o * 

scum of cream on boiled milk, toothsome enough to 
those who like them, but in their case a purgatorial 
infliction. Whenever there is this decided antipathy 
nature should be respected, even in the person of 
the smallest child ; and he who would act otherwise 
is himself smaller than the child over whom he 
would so unjustifiably tyrannize. 



TO CLEAN BRASS, No. 1. 

651. Finely-powdered salammoniac ; 
water to moisten. Rock alum, one part; 



558 THE YOUNG- TTIFE's COOK BOOK. 

water, sixteen parts. Mix; warm the 
articles to be cleaned, then rub with either 
of the above mixtures, and finish with 
tripoli. This process w T ill give them the 
brilliancy of gold. 



TO CLEAN BRASS, No. 2. 

652. Dissolve in a pint of soft water 
an ounce of oxalic acid, and keep it in a 
bottle labelled " Poison." Always shake it 
well before using it. Rub it on the brass 
with a flannel, and then take a dry flannel 
to polish it. Have ready some pulverized 
rotten-stone, sifted through a piece of 
muslin, and mixed with oil of turpentine, 
so as to be liquid. Rub this on with a 
cloth, let it rest ten minutes, and then wipe 
it off with a buckskin. Brass cleaned in 
this manner looks beautifully. 

For cleaning brasses belonging to ma- 
hogany furniture, either powdered whiting 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 559 

or scraped rotten-stone mixed with sweet 
oil, and rubbed on with a buckskin, is ex- 
cellent. Let it rest a little while, and then 
wipe it well off, seeing that none of the 
mixture lodges in the hollows of the brass. 
In cleaning brass handles, hold the handle 
firmly with one hand, while you clean with 
the other, otherwise the handle will soon 
become loosened by the unsteadiness of the 
friction. Oxalic acid being poisonous, care 
must be taken that none of the liquid gets 
into your eyes, when used for rubbing. 
Should this by any accident happen, im- 
mediately get a bowlful, to the brim, of cold 
water, and hold the eyes open in it, till the 
pain abates ; repeating it at intervals during 
the day. 



TO CLEAN BRASS, No. 3. 

653. Powder half a pound of rotten- 
stone very fine, and mix it with an ounce 



500 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

of oxalic acid, dissolved in as much water 
as will make it a stiff paste when perfectly 
dry ; powder it very fine, and put it in a 
bottle for use, and label it " Poison." 
When you wish to use it, mix a little with 
as much sweet oil as will make it a stiff 
paste. Rub it well on the brass with the 
leather; then take another clean leather 
and polish it. 

A WITTY fellow slipped down on an icy pavement. 
While sitting, he muttered, " I have no desire to 
see the town burnt, but I sincerely wish the streets 
were laid in ashes." 



TO CLEAN A BRASS OR COPPER KETTLE, 

654. A brass, bell metal, or copper 
kettle should always be cleaned immedi- 
ately after it is used. Even when not used 
it will require occasional cleaning, otherwise 
it will collect rust or verdigris, which is a 
strong poison. After washing the kettle 
with warm water, put into it a teacupful 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 561 

of vinegar, and a tablespoonful of salt, place 
it over the fire; when hot, rub the kettle 
thoroughly with a cloth, taking care that 
the salt and vinegar shall touch every part 
then wash it with warm water ; next take 
some wood ashes, or fine sand, and scour 
it well, afterward wash it with hot soap 
suds, and finish by rinsing it in cold water ; 
and wiping it dry. 

WINK at small injuries rather than avenge them. 
If to destroy a single bee, you throw down the hive, 
instead of one enemy you make a thousand. 



TO CLEAN BRITANNIA METAL. 

655. Sift rotten-stone through a muslin 
or hair sieve ; mix with it as much soft soap 
as will bring it to the stiffness of putty ; to 
about half a pound of this add two ounces 
of oil of turpentine. It may be made up 
into balls, or put into gallipots ; it will soon 
become hard, and will keep any length of 
time. When the metal is to be cleaned, 

35 



562 THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

rub it first with a piece of flannel moistened 
with sweet oil ; then apply a little of the 
paste with the finger, till the polish is pro- 
duced ; then wash the article with soap and 
hot water, and, when dry, rub with soft 
wash-leather, and a little fine whiting. 



TO CLEAN CANDLESTICKS. 

656. Whether the candlesticks be 
silver, plated, or japanned, the first care 
must be to remove the drops of grease by 
pouring boiling water upon them, and im- 
mediately wiping them with a soft cloth. 
Never place them before the fire to melt 
the grease, as there is danger of melting 
the solder or injuring the plating. Metal 
articles will afterward need polishing with 
plate-powder. 

GREATNESS lies not in being strong, but in the 
right use of strength ; and strength is not used 
rightly when it only serves to carry a man above 
his fellows for his own solitary glory. He is the 
greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts 
by the attraction of his own. 



THE YOUNG TVIFE'S COOK BOOK. 563 
TO CLEAN MATTING. 

657. Straw matting should be washed 
but seldom, as much dampness is injurious 
to it. When it is necessary to clean a floor 
mat, do it by washing with a large coarse 
cloth dipped in salt water ; and, as you pro- 
ceed, wiping it dry with another coarse 
cloth. The salt will prevent the matting 
from turning yellow. If, in putting down a 
floor mat, you have occasion to join it 
across, ravel about an inch at the end of 
each breadth, and tie or knot the lengthway 
threads two together. Then turning all 
these knotted threads underneath, lay one 
edge over the other of the pieces to be 
joined, and tack them down to the floor 
with a row of very small tacks ; each tack 
having a little bit of buckskin on it, to pre- 
vent the head of the nail from injuring or 
wearing out the mat. This ravelling the 
ends of the breadths, and knotting and 
turning under their threads, obviates the 
inconvenience of a thick conspicuous ridge, 



564 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

if the edge of the matting is folded under in 
its full substance. Worsted binding is 
generally used for matting ; but as this is 
sometimes destroyed by moths, it is safer to 
secure the edge of the mat with the suffi- 
ciently durable binding of colored linen or 
thick cotton tape. 

A MAN in Lowell has, for many weeks past, been 
sadly afflicted with drowsiness, and a desire to sleep, 
even before the day has fairly closed. For a long 
time he was unable to discover the cause, but at last 
did so. He has been in the habit of eating eggs, 
fried, boiled, and raw, with his breakfast, and he 
conceives that they have so entered into his system, 
that it becomes necessary for him to retire when the 
hens go to roost. If it also has the effect of arousing 
him in the morning, when the hens begin to stir, the 
result would probably be beneficial. But of this 
there is some doubt. 



TO EXTRACT GREASE FROM PAPERED 

WALLS. 

658. Dip a piece of flannel in spirits of 
wine, rub the greasy spots gently once or 
twice, and the grease will disappear. 



THE YOUNG WIFti's COOK BOOK. 565 

A YOUNG lady should often maintain a prudent re- 
serve and silence in the presence of her lover ; he 
will be certain to fancy her a great deal wiser than 
she can show herself by her talk. 



TO CLEAN PAPER HANGINGS. 

659. All the dust must first be brushed 
from the walls. Then divide a loaf of stale 
white bread ; take the crust into your hand, 
and beginning at the top of the paper, wipe 
it downwards in the lightest manner with 
the crumb. Do not cross or go upward. 
The dirt of the paper and the crumbs will 
fall together. Do not wipe above half a 
yard at a stroke, and after doing all the 
upper part, go round again, beginning a lit- 
tle above where you left off. If you do not 
do it extremely lightly, you will make the 
dirt adhere to the paper. 

MASTER. John, what is the meaning of "fria- 
ble?" 

JOHN. Something to be fried. 



5GG THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
TO CLEAN GREASY CARPETS. 

660. The carpets must be taken up, 
beaten and shaken; remove the grease 
spots, which must be effected by means of a 
paste made of boiling water poured on equal 
quantities of magnesia and fuller's earth ; 
cover all the grease spots with this paste 
while it is hot, and let it remain till quite 
dry, then brush it off, and the grease will 
have disappeared. Carpets must be washed 
with boiling water in which common yellow 
soap and soda have been dissolved, in the 
proportion of an ounce of soap and a drachm 
of soda to each two gallons of water. The 
method of washing is to dip a clean flannel 
into the cleansing liquid and quickly wash 
over a certain portion of the carpet ; then, 
before it can dry, dip another flannel into a 
pail of perfectly clean hot water, and wash 
the same part over again. Then proceed to 
wash another portion, first with the cleans- 
ing, and then with the pure water, and go 
on thus till the whole surface has been 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 567 

cleansed and rinsed in the clean water: not 
more than a yard square should be washed 
at once. When perfectly dry it should be 
again rubbed over with a clean flannel, 
dipped in a strong solution of ox-gall and 
water. This process, though tedious, entire- 
ly renovates faded and soiled and greasy 
carpets. 

A GENTLEMAN, at one time a strong advocate 
of teetotalism, now a bottle manufacturer, was 
recently asked by an acquaintance how he could 
reconcile his former professions with his present 
practice. " Oh," was the reply, " when I started 
bottle making, to be consistent I also began to 
drink beer." 



TO CLEAN FLOOR-CLOTHS. 

661. Sweep, then wipe them with a 
flannel ; and when all dust and spots are re- 
moved, rub with a waxed flannel, and then 
with a clean one; use but little wax, and 
rub only enough to give a little smoothness. 
Washing now and then with milk after the 
above sweeping, and dry rubbing makes 



568 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

them look fresh. An oilcloth should never 
be scrubbed with a brush ; but, after being 
first swept, it should be cleaned by washing 
with a large soft cloth and lukewarm water. 
On no account use soap, or take water that 
is hot; as either of them will bring off the 
paint. 



TO CLEAN ALABASTER. 

662. Alabaster is a species of soft 
marble used for ornamental purposes, which 
derives its name from Alabastron, a town 
of Egypt, where a manufactory formerly ex- 
isted of works of art in domestic vessels, 
executed from the stone found in the neigh- 
boring mountains. As this composition is 
of a delicate nature, easily scratched, and 
soon stained by the smoke or atmosphere, 
all objects should be preserved from these 
external influences by being kept under 
glass shades. Should they however become 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 569 



stained, the following is the, best method. 
Remove the stains by brushing with soap 
and water, then whitewash the stained 
part, and let it remain for some hours ; 
after which remove the whitewash, rub the 
stained part with a soft cloth, and the 
stains will have disappeared. Grease spots 
may be removed by rubbing the blemishes 
with powdered French chalk, or a little oil 
of turpentine. 



TO CLEAN IRON FROM RUST. 

663. Pound some glass to fine powder; 
and, having nailed some linen or woolen 
cloth upon a board, lay upon it a strong 
coat of gum-water, and sift thereon some of 
your powdered glass, and let it dry. Ee- 
peat this operation three times, and when 
the last covering of powdered glass is dry, 
you may easily rub off the rust from iron 
utensils with the cloth thus prepared. 



570 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

VIRTUE WITHOUT FEAR. When, upon mature de- 
liberation, you are persuaded a thing is fit to be 
done, do it boldly ; and do not affect privacy in it, 
or concern yourself at all, what impertinent cen- 
sures or reflections the world will pass upon it. 
For if the thing be not just and innocent, it ought 
not to be attempted at all, though never so secretly. 
And if it be, you do very foolishly to stand in fear 
of those who will themselves do ill in censuring and 
condemning what you do well. Epictetus. 



TO CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES, 

664. Put a few drops of hartshorn in 
a quart of water. Shake the brushes in it, 
rinse them in some clean water, and stand 
them on their ends to dry. A little borax 
in water will clean them very nicely. 

"HAVE you dined ?" said a lounger to his friend. 
" I have, upon my honor," replied he. " Then," re- 
joined the first, " if you have dined upon your honor, 
you must have made but a scanty meal. 



TO CLEANSE MATTRESSES. 

665. Hair mattresses that have be- 
come hard and dirty, can be made nearly 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 571 

as good as new, by ripping them, washing 
the ticking, and picking the hair free from 
bunches, and keeping it in a dry, airy place, 
several days, dry the ticking well, fill it 
lightly with the hair and tack it together. 

AN honest farmer was invited to attend a party 
at a village squire's one evening, where there was 
music, vocal and instrumental. On the following 
morning he met one of the guests, who said, " Well, 
farmer, how did you enjoy yourself last night ? 
Were not the quartettes excellent ?" " Why really, 
sir, I can't say," said he, "for I didn't taste 'em ; 
but the pork chops were first-rate." 



TO CLEANSE THE INSIDE OF JARS. 

666. Fill them with hot water, and 
stir in a spoonful or more of pearlash. 
Empty them in an hour, and if not perfectly 
clean, fill again and let them stand a few 
hours. For large vessels ley may be used. 

CLUTTERBUCK'S story of the old lady (his aunt) is 
excellent. Being very nervous, she told Sir Walter 
Farquhar she thought Bath would do her good. 
"It's very odd," said Sir Walter, "but that's the 
very thing that I was going to recommend to you. 



572 THE YOUXG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

I will write the particulars of } T our case to a very 
clever man there, in whose hands you will be well 
taken care of." The lady, furnished with the letter, 
set off, and on arriving at Newberry, feeling as 
usual very nervous, she said to her confidant, 
" Long as Sir Walter has attended me, he has never 
explained to me what ails me. I have a great mind 
to open his letter, and see what he has stated of my 
case to the Bath physician." In vain her friend 
represented to her the breach of confidence this 
would be. She opened the letter, and read, " Dear 
Davis, keep the old lady three weeks, and then send 
her back again." 



TO CLEAN LAMP SHADES. 

667. Lamp shades of ground glass 
should be cleaned with soap or pearlash; 
these will not injure or discolor them. 

THE reasoning power is the corner-stone of the 
intellectual building, giving grace and strength to 
the whole structure. 



TO CLEAN MARBLE. 

668. Marble is best cleaned with a 
little clean soap and water, to which some 



THE YOUNG T\ r IFE*S COOK BOOK. 573 

ox-gall may be added. Acids should be 

avoided. Marble door steps should be 

cleaned with sand and clean water. No 
soap should be used. 



TO WHITEN PIANO KEYS. 

669. Rub them carefully with a piece 
of fine sandpaper. 

" PRAY, sir, do you sell pies ?" said a gentleman, 
as he strolled into a pastry cook's shop. " Oh yes, 
sir," replied the pastry cook, " pies of all sorts.'' 
"Why, then," said the gentleman, "let me have a 
mag-pie." " That is the only sort of pie in which I 
do not deal," replied the pastry cook ; "but you will 
find plenty of them as you go along, for birds of a 
feather will flock together, they say." 



TO CLEAN DECANTERS. 

670. The greatest care is necessary in 
cleaning decanters. There are several 
materials used for the purpose ; pounded 
egg-shells, wood ashes or sand, are all ob- 



574 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

jectionable as being liable to scratch the 
glass ; some lukewarm soap suds, in which 
a little pearlash has been dissolved, and 
some very small pieces of raw potato 
thrown into the water will generally, when 
well shaken about, remove all the crust 
left on the sides ; a bottle brush, or a piece 
of sponge, tied to the end of a long piece 
of whalebone, may be used to finish the 
polish of the inside after it has been several 
times rinsed with cold water ; then brush 
the outside in a bowl of soap suds with a 
glass brush, rinse with cold water, drain 
in a rack for ten minutes, then dry the 
inside with a soft rag, tied to the end of a 
stick or whalebone, and the outside with 
the glass cloth, and leave the stopper out 
till the inside of the decanter is perfectly 
dry, as spots of mildew will entirely spoil 
it; if decanters are put by empty, a piece 
of paper should be put around the stopper 
to keep it from sticking, and to prevent 
the dust from getting into the bottle ; if 



THE YOFXO WIFE'S COOK BHOTC. 575 

they are put by with wine in them, it is 
well to take out the stopper and replace 
it with a cork, which preserves the wine 
better; decanters and bottles are often 
cleaned with shot; when this is done, care 
should be taken that no grain be left in 
the bottle, as the lead and arsenic used in 
the manufacture of shot, when combined 
with the acid which exists in fermented 
liquors, form a dangerous poison. 

THE more quietly and peaceably we get on, the 
better the better for ourselves, the better for the 
neighbors. In nine cases out of ten, the wisest 
course is, if a man cheat you, to quit dealing with 
him ; if he be abusive, quit his company ; if he slan- 
ders 3 r ou, take care to live so that nobody will be- 
lieve him. 



TO TAKE INK STAINS OUT OF MAHOGANY. 

671. Dilute half a teaspoon ful of the oil 
of vitriol with a large spoonful of water, 
and touch the stain with a camel's hair 
brush. Rub it off quickly, and repeat the 
process until the spot disappears. 



576 THE rouNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

To attract customers, Fume has put up an Elec- 
tric Clock in his shop, and is terribly anno3 T ed by 
boys running in to inquire- the time of day. The 
other evening as we were buying a cigar, a little 
shaver canie in with the usual " Please, sir, tell me 
what time it is." " Why, I told you the time not a 
minute ago," said the astonished tobacconist. " Yes, 

O ' 

sir," replied the lad, 'but this is for another 
woman." 



TO REMOVE FRESH INK FROM A CARPET. 

672. As soon as the ink has been 
spilled, take up as much as you can with a 
sponge, and then pour on cold water re- 
peatedly, still taking up the liquid ; next 
rub the place with a little wet oxalic acid 
or salt of sorrel, and wash it off immediately 
with cold water, then rub on some harts- 
horn. 

A CLERGYMAN, happening to get wet, was standing 
before the session-room fire to dry his clothes, and 
when his colleague came in, he asked him to preach 
for him as he was very wet. " No, sir, I thank you," 
was the prompt reply ; " preach yourself you will 
be dry enough in the pulpit." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 577 

TO REMOVE INK-SPOTS FROM WHITE 

CLOTHES. 

673. This must be done before the 
clothes are washed. Pick some tallow from 
the bottom of a clean mould candle, rub it 
hard on the ink-spots, and leave it sticking 
there in bits, till next day or longer. Then 
let the article be washed and boiled ; and if 
it is merely common ink, the stain will 
entirely disappear. Of course, this remedy 
can only be used for white things, as 
colored clothes cannot be boiled without en- 
tirely fading them. We know it to be effi- 
cacious. The tallow must be rubbed on 
cold. A most effective preparation for re- 
moving ink-spots may be made by the 
following receipt. An ounce each of sal- 
ammonia and salt of tartar well mixed, 
must be put into a quart bottle, a pint of 
cold soft water added to them, and the 
whole well shaken for a quarter of an hour. 
The bottle may be then filled with water, 

shaken a little longer, and corked. Wet 
as 



578 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

the marked linen effectually with this 
mixture, and repeat the process till the 
stains disappear. 

WE know that men naturally shrink from the at- 
tempt to obtain companions who are their superiors ; 
but they will find that really intelligent women, who 
possess the most desirable qualities, are uniformly 
modest, and hold their charms in humble estimation. 
Don't imagine that any disappointment in love 
which takes place before you are twenty-one years 
old will be of any material damage to you. The 
truth is, that before a man is twenty-five years old 
he does not himself know what he wants. The more 
of a man you become, and the more manliness you 
become capable of exhibiting in your association 
with women, the better wife you will be able to ob- 
tain ; and one year's possession of the heart and 
hand of a really noble woman is worth nine hundred 
and ninety-nine years' possession of a sweet crea- 
ture with two ideas in her head and nothing new to 
say about either of them. 



ANOTHER METHOD OF REMOVING INK- 
SPOTS. 

674. Dissolve some oxalic acid in 
water, wet the spot with the liquid, and 
the stain will almost instantly disappear. 
Wash the linen immediately in clean water, 
or the acid will injure the fabric. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 579 

VARIOUS METHODS OF MENDING BROKEN 

ARTICLES. 

675. There are a great many cements 
by which broken glass and china may be 
joined, and the selection of one of these 
from among a number must mainly depend 
upon the transparency or color of the article 
to be mended, the nature of the fracture, 
and other considerations. 

It is an important rule in the use of all 
cements that only a small quantity should 
be employed ; and that, generally speaking, 
thin cements, judiciously applied, will unite 
articles more strongly than thick ones. 



TO JOIN GLASS THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN. 

676. Dissolve half an ounce of isinglass 
in a little spirits of wine, add a tablespoon- 
ful of water ; warm it slowly over the fire 
till it forms a transparent glue. Then 
spread it nicely on the edges of the broken 



580 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOIC 

glass, unite them, and in a few minutes 
the joining will be firm and scarcely per- 
ceptible. 



ANOTHER WAY TO JOIN BROKEN GLASS. 

677. Broken glass may be mended as 
follows : Get some cloves of garlic, tie 
them in a rag, and place them in a tin pan, 
pounding them with a hammer, to express 
the juice. Wet the broken edges of the 
glass with this juice, and stick them firmly 
together ; stand the article upon a plate, or 
other level surface, and let it remain un- 
disturbed for a fortnight. 

GOOD and friendly conduct may meet with an un- 
worthy, with an ungrateful return ; but the absence 
of gratitude on the part of the receiver cannot de- 
stroy the self-approbation which recompenses the 
giver. And we may scatter the seeds of courtesy 
and kindness around us at so little expense. Some 
of them will inevitably fall on good ground, and 
grow up into benevolence in the mind of others, and 
all of them will bear fruit of happiness in the bosom 
whence they sprang. Once blest are all the virtues 
always ; twice blest sometimes. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 581 
CEMENT FOR BROKEN GLASS OR CHINA. 

678. China or glass may be mended 
as follows : Slake some quicklime with 
boiled water, and collect some of the fine 
powder of the lime. Take the white of an 
egg and well beat it with an equal bulk of 
water, and add the slaked lime to it, so 
as to form a thin paste. It must be used 
speedily, and will be found to be very 
strong, and capable of resisting the action 
of boiling water. 



ANOTHER WAY TO MEND CHINA. 

679. Grind a piece of flint glass on a 
painter's stone to the very finest powder; 
rub it into a paste with the white of an egg, 
and it will form a cement that will unite 
china so completely that it cannot be sepa- 
rated by any means. 

Cracked vessels of China earthenware, 
etc., such as chimney ornaments arid vases, 



582 THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 

may be repaired by putting on the inside 
strips of tape, rubbed over with white 
lead. 



ANOTHER WAY TO MEND BROKEN CHINA. 

680. Make a very thick solution of 
gum-arabic in water, and stir into it plaster 
of Paris until the mixture becomes a thick 
paste. Apply it with a brush to the frac- 
tured edges, and stick them together. The 
whiteness of the cement renders it doubly 
valuable. 



GLUE FOR UNITING CARDBOARD, ETC. 

681. For uniting cardboard, paper, 
and small articles of fancy-work, the best 
glue, dissolved with about one third its 
weight of coarse brown sugar in the smallest 
quantity of boiling water, is very good. 
When this is in a liquid state, it may be 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 583 

dropped in a thin cake upon a plate, and 
allowed to dry. When required for use, 
one end of the cake may be moistened by 
the mouth, and rubbed on the substances 
to be joined. 



FLOUR PASTE. 

682. The uses of flour paste are very 
well known. But it will be found a great 
improvement to add a little alum to it 
before boiling ; it will then w T ork more 
freely, the particles of flour will not 
separate from the water, and it will unite 
surfaces much more firmly. 

A paste to resist the attacks of insects 
may be made by omitting the alum, and 
putting to each half pint of paste, fifteen 
grains of corrosive sublimate in powder, 
and well mixing it. This paste is poisonous. 

MEN are frequently like tea ; the real strength 
and goodness are not properly drawn out of them 
till they have been a short time in hot water. 



584 THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 

RICE GLUE. 

683. Rice glue is a very delicate and 
suitable article for fancy work. Thoroughly 
mix rice flour with cold water, let it simmer 
gently over a slow fire. This is excellent 
for joining paper, etc., and if properly made 
and applied, the joining will be found very 
strong. When dry it is almost transparent. 



CEMENT FOR MENDING STONE, ETC. 

684. Mix in fine dry powder twenty 
parts of well washed and sifted sand, two 
of litharge, and one of freshly burned and 
slacked quicklime. This is suitable for fill- 
ing up cracks etc. It sets in a few hours, 
and has the appearance of light stone. 



MASTIC CEMENT, 

685. Mastic cement, or mastic glue, 
suitable for china, glass, the finer stones, 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 585 

marbles, or even for metals, is made as fol- 
lows : To one ounce of mastic, add as much 
highly rectified spirits of wine as will dis- 
solve it. Soak an ounce of isinglass in 
water till quite soft, then dissolve it in pure 
rum or brandy until it forms a strong glue, 
to which add about a quarter of an ounce of 
gum ammoniac, well rubbed, and mixed. 
Put the two mixtures together in an earthen 
vessel over a gentle heat, and when well 
united, put into a small bottle and keep it 
well stopped. When wanted for use, the 
bottle must be set in warm w r ater, and the 
china or glass articles must be warmed be- 
fore the cement is applied. The broken 
surfaces, when carefully fitted, should be 
kept in close contact for twelve hours at 
least, until the cement is fully set, after 
which the fracture will be as secure as any 
part of the vessel, and scarcely perceptible. 

A .GENTLEMAN whose house was under repair, 
went one day to see how the job was getting on, 
and observing a quantity of nails lying about, said 



586 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

to a carpenter, " Wh}' don't you take care of these 
nails, they'll certainly be lost ?" " No," replied 
Master Chopstick, " you'll find them all in the bill.'' 



TO MEND ALABASTER ORNAMENTS. 

686. As alabaster objects are composed 
of several parts, they are liable, from a 
variety of causes, to become disjoined, and 
when this occurs the parts may be rejoined 
by a cement made from the white of one 
egg mixed with a teaspoonful of quicklime. 
The cement should be used immediately 
that it is mixed, and the parts to be joined 
should be previously damped with luke- 
warm water. 



CEMENT FOR LEATHER. 

687. An adhesive material for joining 
leather, cloth, etc., is made as follows : 
Take one ounce of gutta percha, four ounces 
of India rubber, two ounces of pitch, one 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 587 

ounce of shellac, and two ounces of oil. 
Melt these ingredients together and use the 
mixture while hot. 

THERE is no policy like politeness ; and a good 
manner is the best thing in the world, either to get 
a good name or to supply the want of it. 



CEMENT FOE ALABASTER ORNAMENTS. 

688. Mix the white of one egg with a 
teaspoonful of quick lime. The parts to be 
joined should be dampened with lukewarm 
water, and the cement should be put on the 
moment it is mixed. 



CHEAP LOTION FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

689. Have a pot of strained honey on 
your wash-stand, and every time you wash 
your hands, dip your wet finger into the 
honey and rub it over your hands while wet. 
Wipe them very dry and the skin will be 



588 THE YOUNG TTIFF/S COOTv P.OOK. 

soft even in the coldest weather. A few 
drops of glycerine rubbed on the hands 
daily will make them soft. 



METHOD OF WASHING THE HANDS. 

690. Take some dry Indian meal, wet 
your hands and rub them with it, then 
wash them with soap and tepid water. 
This is as good arid much cheaper than 
sand soap. 

WE never dreamed until lately that there was an 
aristocracy of appetites. We overheard in the mar- 
ket the following brief dialogue between an old lady 
and a little girl: " Mary," said the lacty, " I should 
like to buy some of those cucumbers, if you will 
carry them home." " No, don't, granma !" " Why 
not?" "Because I should be ashamed to be seen 
carrying them home when everybody knows they're 
only a penny apiece.' 11 



PASTE FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

691. Mix a quarter of a pound of 
unsalted hog's lard, which has been w ashed 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 589 

in water and then in rose-water, with the 
yolks of two new-laid eggs, and a large 
spoonful of honey. Add as much fine oat- 
meal, or almond paste, as will work into a 
paste. 

MAKE no expense but to do good to others or 
yourself, i. e., waste nothing. 



OINTMENT FOE CHAPPED HANDS. 

692. Mix half an ounce of glycerine 
and two scruples of borax in half a pint of 
boiling water. Use morning and evening. 

" To live much in a little time is, in a manner, as 
good as if the very time past were lived over again." 



RECEIPT FOR MAKING THE HANDS WHITE. 

693. In order to preserve the hands 
soft and white, they should always be 
washed in warm water with fine soap, and 
carefully dried with a moderately coarse 
towel, being well rubbed every time to 



f'OO THE YOUNG WOTl'S COOK BOOK. 

insure a brisk circulation, than which 
nothing can be more effectual in promo- 
ting a transparent and soft appearance. 
Almond paste is of essential use in pre- 
serving the delicacy of the hands. It is 
made thus : Blanch and beat up four ounces 
of bitter almonds ; add to them three ounces 
of lemon-juice, three ounces of almond oil, 
and a little weak spirits of wine. The 
following is a serviceable pomade for rub- 
bing the hands on retiring to rest : Take 
two ounces of sweet almonds, beat with 
three drachms of white wax, and three 
drachms of spermaceti; put up carefully 
in rose-water. 



WASH TO WHITEN THE NAILS. 

694. Tincture of myrrh, one drachm; 
diluted sulphuric acid, two drachms ; spring 
water, four ounces. Mix. First cleanse 
with white soap, then dip the finger into 
the wash. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 591 



THUNDER and lightning are believed not to 
occur in the Arctic or Antarctic regions, beyond the 
seventy-fifth degree of north latitude ; and even as 
low as the seventieth degree these phenomena are 
very rare. 



CLEANSING THE HAIR. 

695. Nothing but good can be derived 
from a due attention to cleansing the hair. 
Of course, an immoderate use of water is 
not beneficial. Once a week is perhaps 
desirable, but this will depend upon the 
individual ; persons with light, thin and 
dry hair will require it more seldom than 
those with thick, strong hair, or who 
perspire very freely. Nothing is better 
than soap and water. The soap should 
be mild, and well and plentifully rubbed 
in the hair. 

BAD WRITING. It is inexcusable in any one to 
write illegibly. When I was a schoolboy, I used to 
get hold of our writing-master's copies and trace 
them against the window ; hence the plain hand I 
now write. When the great Lord Clive was in India 
his sisters sent him some handsome presents from 



502 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

England ; and he informed them by letter that he 
had returned them an " elephant" (at least so they 
read the word). The announcement threw them 
into the utmost perplexity, for what could they 
possibly do with the animal ? The word meant 
was " equivalent." 



TO CLEANSE AND PEEVENT THE HAIR 
FROM FALLING OFF. 

696. Take two large handfuls of rose- 
mary leaves, a piece of common soda about 
the size of a hazel nut, and a drachm of 
camphor. Put it in a jug, pour on it a 
quart of boiling water, and cover it closely 
to keep the steam in. Let it stand for 
twelve hours, then strain it, and add a wine- 
glassful of rum. It is then ready for use. 
If the hair falls off much, the wash ought to 
be applied to the roots with a piece of 
sponge, every other day, taking care to wet 
the skin thoroughly. Then rub dry with a 
towel, brush well, and use only as much 
pomade as will keep down the short hairs, 
as the wash makes the hair soft and glossy. 



THE YOUNG TVIFE*S COOK BOOK. 593 

This will keep good for several months in 
bottles well corked, and a piece of camphor 
in each. 

MY hair and I are quits, d'ye see ? 
I cut my hair it now cuts me. 



A RECEIPT FOR POMADE. 

697. Three ounces of olive oil, three 
quarters of a drachm of the oil of almonds, 
two drachms of palm oil, half an ounce of 
white wax, a quarter of a pound of lard, 
and three quarters of a drachm of the 
essence of bergamot. 

A THIEF OUTWITTED. A young Englishman, 

' o 

whilst at Naples, was introduced at an assembly of 
one of the first ladies by a Neapolitan gentleman. 
While he was there his snuff box was stolen from 
him. The next day, being at another house, he saw 
a person taking snnff. He ran to his friend 
" There," said he, " that person in blue, with gold 
embroidery, is taking snuff out the box stolen from 
me yesterday. Do you know him ? Is he not a 
sharper ?" " Take care," said the other, " that is a 
gentleman of the first rank." " I don't care," said 
the Englishman, " I must have my snnff box again. 
I'll go and ask him for it." " Pray," said his friend, 
37 



594 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

"be quiet, and leave the matter to me." Upon this 
assurance, the Englishman went away after inviting 
his friend to dine with him next day. He accord- 
ingly came, and as he entered " There," said he, 
" 1 have brought you your snuff box." " Well, how 
did you obtain it?" " Why," said the Neapolitan 
nobleman, " I did not wish to make any noise about 
it, so I picked his pocket." 



CASTOR OIL CREAM FOR THE HAIR. 

698. Put half a pound of fresh lard 
into a basin, and pour a quart of boiling 
water over it ; stir it, that it may be well 
melted. When cold, take it off the water, 
squeeze it dry, and beat it with a wooden 
fork till in soft cream ; then add, by degrees, 
an ounce and a half of fresh castor oil and 
twenty-five drops of essential oil of berga- 
mot, or any other perfume preferred. Beat 
it till quite like a thick cream. Put it into 
covered toilet pots. 

HARBOR not revenge in thy breast, it will torment 
thy heart, and discolor its best inclinations 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 595 

POMATUM FOR CHILDREN'S HAIR. 

699. Pick carefully and wash a quarter 
of a pound of beef-marrow ; put it into an 
earthen jar, with a quarter of a pound of 
fresh lard; stand it in boiling water till 
melted and clear; then strain it into a 
basin, add a gill of rose water. Stir it well, 
and let it get cold. Break it up and squeeze 
it through the rose water till it begins to be 
soft ; then press out the water, and beat it 
with a wooden fork ; add one ounce of pure 
olive oil, and half an ounce of violet-scented 
oil. Beat till it is quite smooth, and put it 
into covered toilet pots. (The mixing of 
every kind of pomatum had better be done 
in a cool place; more particularly when 
castor oil is used.) 

RED-TAPE ROUTINE. By a singular regulation 
the government couriers in Austria are ordered, 
when charged with despatches, sealed with only one 
seal, to go at a walking pace ; if with two seals, to 
trot ; and if with three, to gallop. A courier, bear- 
ing a despatch with three seals, passing lately 
through a garrison town, was requested by the 
commandant to take a despatch to the next town- 



596 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

To this he willingly agreed, but perceiving that it 
had only one seal, he refused to take charge of it, 
saying, that the regulations ordered him to walk 
his horse with such a despatch, and as he had an- 
other with which he was ordered to gallop, he could 
not possibly take both of them. 



CHILDREN'S CURLS. 

700. If the hair be soft and fine, try 
brushing it with a brush dipped slightly in 
spirits of hartshorn ; or melt a bit of white 
wax the size of a nut-kernel, in an ounce of 
olive oil, and dress the hair in curls with it. 

HATH any one wronged thee ? be bravely revenged. 
Slight it, and the work has begun j forgive it, and 
it is finished. 



CURLING FLUID, FOR THE HAIR. 

701. Melt a piece of white beeswax 
about the size of a filbert in an ounce of 
olive oil, and add one or two drops of otto 
of roses. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 597 



BANDOLINE. 

702. An ounce of the seed of quinces 
must be boiled in three pints of water till 
reduced half, then strain it, and add a few 
drops of essence to perfume it. Keep it 
in wide-mouthed, well-corked bottles. 



ANOTHER KIND OF BANDOLINE. 

703. Boil a quarter of an ounce of Irish 
moss in one quart of water. When suffi- 
ciently thick, bottle it, and put a teaspoonful 
of rectified spirits in each bottle to prevent 
mildew. 



LIP SALVE. 

704. Take two ounces of oil of sweet 
almonds, half an ounce of white wax, and 
half an ounce of rose-water ; cut the wax 
into small pieces, put them in a mortar, and 



598 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

set the mortar in a vessel of boiling water, 
When the wax has melted, take out the 
mortar, and add the oil by degrees, beating 
the pestle until it is cool ; mix the rose-water 
with the mass. To color it, rub a little 
carmine with the oil before mixing it with 
the wax. A little beeswax melted in sweet 
oil, makes a cheap lip salve. 

ENDEAVOR to be first in thy calling whatever it 
be, neither let any one go before thee in well-doing ; 
nevertheless, do not envy the merits of another, but 
improve thine own talents. 



* 



ESSENCE OF JESSAMINE, 

705. This is obtained in the following 
way : A layer of flowers is spread over the 
bottom of a hair sieve, and upon the flower 
is laid a layer of small and detached bits 
of the finest cotton wool, which have been 
dipped in oil of Ben that oil being prefera- 
ble to any other, as it does not become ran- 
cid. Over the cotton is laid another layer 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 599 

of flowers, and so on alternately cotton and 
flowers, until the sieve is full. When these 
have lain twenty-four hours, the flowers 
are removed and fresh ones introduced, a 
process repeated until the cotton is quite im- 
pregnated with the odor. The oil is then 
pressed out of the cotton. Add to it some 
highly rectified spirits of wine, and keep 
it in closely stopped bottles. The jonquil 
rose, or heliotrope, may be served in the 
same way. 



TO MAKE A SCENT JAR. 

706. Gather rose leaves on a fine day, 
lay them in a broad mouthed jar, and 
sprinkle a little common salt over each 
layer of leaves. Lavender blossoms or any 
sweet-scented flowers may be added. Strew 
over the whole, a little bay salt, well 
pounded, some orris root, sliced, cloves, 
cinnamon, and angelica root, sliced. Mix the 
ingredients and cover the jar close. 



600 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

T^o young man really believes he shall ever die. 
There is a feeling of eternity in youth which makes 
us amends for every thing. Death, old age, are 
words without a meaning a dream, a fiction. To 
be young is to be as one of the immortals. 



BOUQUET DE LA HEINE. 

707. A highly fragrant and much 
esteemed perfume for the handkerchief, etc., 
compounded as follows : Oils of bergamot 
and lavender, of each, thirty drops ; neroli, 
fifteen drops; oils of verbena and cloves, 
of each, five drops; essence of musk, 
ambergris, and jasmine, of each, half a 
drachm ; rectified spirit of wine, two ounces; 

mix. 

IF you woo the company of angels in your waking 
hours, they will be sure to come to you in your 
sleep. 



HONEY SOAP, 

708. Cut into thin shavings, two 
pounds of common yellow or white soap; 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 601 

set it over the fire with just enough water 
to k'iep it from burning ; when quite melted, 
add a quarter of a pound of honey, and stir 
the mixture till it boils; then take it off 
and add a few drops of any agreeable per- 
fume ; pour it into a deep dish to cool. 

TAKE care always to form your establishment so 
much within your income as to leave a sufficient 
fund for unexpected contingencies and a prudent 
liberality. There is hardly a day in any man's life 
in which a small sum of ready money may not be 
employed to great advantage. 



VIOLET PERFUME. 

709. Drop twelve drops of oil of rho- 
dium on a piece of loaf sugar, grind this 
well in a glass mortar, and mix it tho- 
roughly with three pounds of orris-root 
powder. This will resemble the perfume 
of violet. If more oil of rhodium be added, 
a rose perfume, instead of violet, will be 
produced. 

TOLERATE no uncleanliness in body, clothes or 
habitation. 



602 TTTE YOUXfi- WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

WHITEWASH THAT WILL NOT RUB OFF. 

710. Slake the lime in the usual way. 
Mix one gill of flour with a little cold 
water, taking care to beat out all the 
lumps ; then pour on it boiling water enough 
to thicken it to the consistency of common 
starch when boiled for use. Pour it while 
hot into a bucket of the slaked lime, and 
add one pound of whiting. Stir all well 
together. A little "blue water," made by 
squeezing the indigo bag, or a little pulver- 
ized indigo mixed with water, improves it. 

A FRENCHMAN being afflicted with the gout, was 
asked what difference there was between that and 
the rheumatism. "One very great deferance!" 
replied Monsieur. " Suppose you take one vice, 
you put your finger in, you turn de screw till you 
bear him no longer dat is the rheumatis den, 
spose you give him one turn more, dat is de gout." 



ENDS OF CANDLES CONVERTED INTO 
NIGHT LIGHTS, 

711. Supposing a few night lights to be 
wanted in places where they cannot be pro- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 603 

cured, they may be made from the ends of 
candles in the following manner. Collect a 
few old pill-boxes ; make as many fine cotton 
wicks as you have boxes, and wax the cot- 
ton with beeswax ; cut them to the re- 
quisite length, and fix them in the centre of 
the boxes, through a pin-hole in the bottom. 
Melt the grease (if mixed with a little wax 
the better) and fill the boxes, keeping the 
cotton in a central position while the grease 
cools. When set to burn, place the box in 
a saucer, with sufficient water to surround 
the bottom, about the sixteenth of an inch 
in depth. 

WE have heard of a would-be wit who kept a 
nutmeg-grater on his table, in order to say when a 
great man was mentioned, " There's a greater." 



THE TURKISH BATH UPON A SMALL 

SCALE. 

712. Place the patient upon a large 
cane-bottomed chair, and tie a large blan- 



604 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

ket around his neck, so as to completely 
envelope the chair and his body ; under- 
neath the chair, place a saucer full of 
alcohol (spirits of wine) and set a light to 
it. The space within the blanket will soon 
be filled with hot air, and a profuse per- 
spiration will be produced. 



A SIMPLE METHOD OF CATCHING AND 
DESTKOYING FLIES. 

713. Take some jars, mugs, or tumblers, 
fill them half full with soapy water ; cover 
them as jam-pots are covered, with a piece 
of paper, either tied down or tucked under 
the rim. Let this paper be rubbed inside 
with wet sugar, molasses, honey, or jam, or 
any thing sweet, cut a small hole in the 
centre, large enough for a fly to enter. The 
flies settle on the top, attracted by the smell 
of the bait ; they then crawl through the 
hole, to feed upon the sweet beneath. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 005 

Meanwhile the warmth of the weather 
causes the soapy water to ferment, and pro- 
duces a gas which overpowers the flies, and 
they drop down into the vessel. Thousands 
may be destroyed this way, and the traps 
last a long time. 



TINCTURE OF NUTMEG. 

714. A very useful tincture of nutmeg, 
ready for immediate use, may be made by 
adding three ounces of bruised or grated 
nutmeg to a quart of brandy. A smaller 
quantity may be made, by observing the 
same proportions. This will be a very 
grateful addition to all compounds in which 
nutmeg is used ; a few drops will suffice to 
impart a flavor. 

" THE candles you sold me last were very bad," 
said Suett, to a tallow-chandler. " Indeed, sir, I 
am sorry for that." "Yes, sir, do you know that 
they burnt to the middle, and would then burn no 
longer." "You surprise me ; what, sir, did they go 
out?" "No, sir, no; they burnt shorter."

TO PREVENT THE BREAKAGE OF LAMP 

CHIMNEYS. 

715. Every housewife who uses kero- 
sene oil, knows that it affords the best and 
cheapest light of all illuminating oils. But 
she also knows that the constant expense 
and annoyance from the breakage of lamp 
chimneys, almost if not quite counterbal- 
ances the advantages of its use. Put the 
glass chimney in lukewarm water, heat it to 
the boiling point, and boil it one hour; after 
which leave it in the water till it cools. 
The chimney will be less liable to crack by 
sudden changes of temperature. 



TO PREPARE FEATHERS FOR BEDS. 

716. Feathers should be put into bags 
of brown paper as soon as they are plucked ; 
the goose feathers, which are the most 
valuable, should always be kept separate 
from those of the ducks or chickens; the 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 607 

feathers must be picked carefully that no 
flesh or skin adhere to them, and the 
pinions and large feathers must be stripped 
from the quills, which must be kept from 
the feathers. The bags must be kept hung 
in a warm place. If the kitchen be lofty, 
and they can be suspended from the ceiling 
without inconvenience, they will soon be- 
come perfectly dry there. As soon as a 
sufficient quantity of feathers have been 
collected, it is the best plan to fill a pillow 
with them ; the goose feathers can afterward 
be transferred to a bed-tick ; the feathers of 
fowls being commonly used for pillows. Old 
feathers may be greatly improved by empty- 
ing the tick, (which should also be washed,) 
and washing them through several lathers 
of strong soapsuds, rinse them well in cold 
water, drain them on sieves, and spread 
them to dry on the floor of an empty garret; 
their drying may be accelerated by sewing 
them in a coarse sheet, and putting them 
into the oven on a baking day, after the 



60S THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

oread is drawn, and letting them remain 
there till next morning, this should be 
several times repeated, then put them into 
bags and beat them. 

BRIDGET, just arrived from sweet Erin, and 
snugly ensconced ; with a genteel family as maid of 
all work, sat down to her first meal. Having dimin- 
ished the substantials, she came to an apple-pie. 
It was something entirely new to her. She viewed 
it from all quarters, and examined it very minutely. 
She then removed the upper-crust and commenced 
eating the apple, carefully scraping it from the 
under-crust. Her mistress observed her, and said, 
" Bridget, why do you eat the pie in that manner?" 
A little startled, Bridget looked up, and exclaimed. 
" Does ye think I'd be ateing the boxing ?"

BEDS FOR THE POOR. 

717. Beech leaves are recommended for 
this purpose, as they are very elastic, and 
will not harbor vermin. They should be 
gathered on a dry day in the autumn, and 
be perfectly dried. 

The chaff of newly-thrashed oats also 
forms wholesome and comfortable beds.

A YANKEE sitting on a very hard seat in a rail- 
way carriage, said, " Wai, they tell me these here 
cushions air stuffed with feathers. They may have 
put the feathers in 'em, but darn me if I don't think 
they've left the fowls in too!" 



TO REMOVE THE TASTE OF NEW WOOD. 

718. A new keg, churn, bucket, or 
other wooden vessel, will generally com- 
municate a disagreeable taste to any thing 
that is put into it. To prevent this incon- 
venience, first scald the vessel well with 
boiling water, letting the water remain in 
it till cold. Then dissolve some pearlash, 
or soda, in luke-warm water, adding a little 
bit of lime to it, and wash the inside of the 
vessel well with this solution. Afterward, 
scald it well with plain hot water, and rinse 
it with cold before you use it. 

A PARISH official, of sedate manners, fell on the 
pavement, during a frost, for the sufficient reason 
that he was intoxicated. Turning to the bystanders, 
he asked. "Are our by-laws to be enforced or not, I 
should like to know ? Why don't you spread ashes 
before your houses /"

TO REMOVE GREASE SPOTS. 

719. Magnesia will effectually remove 
grease spots from silk on rubbing it in well ; 
and after standing awhile, apply a piece of 
soft brown paper to the wrong side, on 
which press a warm iron gently ; and what 
grease is not absorbed by the paper, can be 
removed by washing the spot carefully with 
warm water. 

CONSIDER how few things are worthy of anger, 
and thou wilt wonder that any fools should be 
wroth. 



TO SCOUR BOARDS. 

720. Mix lime, one part; sand, three 
parts ; soft soap, two parts. Lay a little on 
the boards with a scrubbing brush, and rub 
thoroughly. Be careful to clean straight up 
and down not crossing from board to 
board ; then dry with clean cloths, rubbing 
hard up and down the same way. Floors 
should not often be wetted, but very 



THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 611 

thoroughly when done ; and once a week 
they may be dry-rubbed with hot sand and 
a heavy brush the right way of the boards. 



TO POLISH ALABASTER ORNAMENTS. 

721. First carefully clean the article 
with a piece of pumice stone dipped in 
water; then apply a thick paste made of 
whiting, soap and milk; and when this is 
perfectly done, wash the article thoroughly, 
dry it with a soft cloth, and rub with a flan- 
nel until the polish is produced. 

ZEAL without knowledge is fire without light. 



TO IMITATE ALABASTER. 

722. Alabaster ornaments may be 
imitated by brushing over plaster of Paris 
models with spermaceti, white wax, or a 
mixture of the two, or by steeping the 



612 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

models in the warm mixture. Or instead 
of this process, they may be brushed over 
several times with white of egg, allowing 
each coating sufficient time to dry. Only 
models made of the finest plaster are suited 
for these processes. 



USES OF COAL ASHES. 

723. They are said to prevent the 
depredations of garden mice if spread over 
the surface of the mould. Coal ashes are 
said to accelerate the appearance of early 
sown peas. Strew the surface of the ground 
with coal ashes as soon as the peas are put 
in the ground, and they will appear three 
or four days earlier than when no ashes are 
spread. 

THERE is nothing in the universe more desirable 
than a free mind. So long as a man has this, he 
has that which nothing can subdue, he has that 
which nothing can subvert, he has that which ren- 
ders him a monarch, though he may lie down upon 
the bare cold bosom of his mother earth. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 613 
CHEAP SOAP. 

724. Cut two pounds of common brown 
soap into thin slices, to which add one ounce 
of borax and ten quarts of water. Put the 
whole over the fire, and when the soap and 
borax are dissolved the soap is done. It re- 
quires but little time and trouble to make 
this soap, which is very valuable for wash- 
ing dishes, cleaning paint, scrubbing floors, 
etc. It is, moreover, very healing to the 
hands. If less water is used, the soap will 
be harder. 

GOOD temper is the philosophy of the heart a 
gem of the treasury within, whose rays are reflec- 
ted on all outward objects ; a perpetual sunshine, 
imparting warmth, light, and life to all within the 
spheres of its influence. 



TO PREVENT RUST. 

725. Mix with fat oil varnish, four fifths 
of well rectified spirits of turpentine. The 
varnish is to be applied by means of a 



614 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

sponge. Articles varnished in this man- 
ner will retain their metallic brilliancy and 
never contract any spots of rust. It may be 
applied to copper, and to the preservation 
of philosophical instruments, which, by 
being brought into contact with water, are 
liable to lose their splendor and become 
tarnished. 

LIKE his counterpart Shakspeare, Sir Walter 
Scott was much given to punning. Among a thou- 
sand instances of this propensity in the latter, we 
record one. A friend borrowing a book one day, 
Sir Walter put it into his hands with these words : 
" Now, I consider it necessary to remind you, that 
this volume should be soon returned ; for, trust me, 
I find that although many of my friends are bad 
arithmeticians, almost all of them are good book- 
keepers." 



TO REMOVE SCORCH MARKS. 

726. If linen has been scorched and the 
mark has not penetrated entirely through 
so as to damage the texture, it may be re- 
moved by the following process : peel and 



THE YOUNG WIPES COOK BOOK. 615 

slice two onions, and extract the juice by 
squeezing or pounding. Then cut up half 
an ounce of white soap, add two ounces of 
fuller's earth, and mix them with the onion 
juice and half a pint of vinegar. Boil this 
composition well ; then spread it, when cool, 
over the scorched part of the linen, and let 
it dry on. Afterward, wash out the linen, 
and the mark will be found to have been 
removed. 

THE reason why policemen are never run over is, 
they are never in the way. 



SAVING OF FUEL. 

727. The grate or cavity for the recep- 
tion of coal, should never be filled more 
than three parts full at one time. The fuel 
ignites more thoroughly, and a greater 
amount of heat is thrown out by a given 
amount of coal. 



616 THE YOUXG TTIFE's COOK P.OOK. 

"THE fire is going out, Miss Filkins." "I know 
it, Mr. Green ; and if you would act wisely, you 
would follow its example." It is unnecessary to 
add, that Green never came to see that young lady 
again. 



TO WASH BLOND LACE. 

728. The French blond lace may be 
washed by sewing it round a bottle, as in 
the direction for thread lace on page 618. 
Then place the bottle upright in a strong 
lather of white soap and clear soft water. 
Set it in the sun, and rub the lace gently 
with your hands. Repeat the process every 
day for a week, keeping it in the sun, and 
rubbing the lace gently every time the 
lather is renewed. Then unfold the lace 
from the bottle, and pin it on a large pillow 
or cushion tightly, using a separate pin for 
every scallop, and placing it very straight 
and even. Let it dry perfectly on the 
pillow; then unpin and take it off; but 
do not starch, iron, or press it; fold it 
loosely and put it by.

How many a man by throwing himself to the 
ground in despair, destroys forever a thousand 
flowers of hope that were ready to spring up along 
his pathway. 



TO TAKE OUT MILDEW FROM LINEN, No. 1. 

729. Two tablespoonfuls of soft soap 
and the juice of a lemon. Lay it on the 
spots with a brush, on both sides of the 
linen. Let it lie a day or two till the stains 
disappear. 

THE PRINCE OP GENTLEMEN. " Here, you bog- 
trotter," said a coxcomb, with a patronizing air, 
"come and tell me the greatest lie you can, and I'll 
treat you to a jug of whisky punch." "On my 
word," answered Barney, " yer honor's a gintleman !" 



TO TAKE OUT MILDEW FROM LINEN, No. 2. 

730. Take soap and rub it well ; then 
scrape some fine chalk, and rub that also in 
the linen ; lay it on the gra^s ; as it dries, 
wet it a little, and it will come out at 
once. 



618 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

MEN often talk of the humbleness of their origin 
when they are really ashamed of it, though vain of 
the talent that enabled them to emerge from it. 



TO WASH THREAD LACE, 

731. Having ripped the lace from the 
article to which it was attached, and care- 
fully picked out the loose bits of thread, roll 
the lace very smoothly and securely round 
a clean black bottle, which has been covered 
with new white linen, sewed on tightly. 
Tack each end of the lace with a needle and 
thread, to keep it smooth ; and in wrapping 
it round the bottle, take care not to crumple 
or fold in any of the scollops or pearlings. 
Pour into a saucer a very little of the best 
sweet oil, and, dipping in your finger, touch 
it lightly on the lace while proceeding to 
wind it on the bottle too much oil will 
make it greasy. Have ready a wash kettle, 
a strong, cold lather made of very clear 
water, and white Castile soap. Having 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 619 

filled the bottle with cold water to keep it 
from bursting, set it upright in the suds, 
and tie a string round the neck, securing it 
to the ears or handle of the kettle, to pre- 
vent its knocking about and breaking while 
over the fire. Let it boil in the suds for an 
hour or more, or till the lace is clean and 
white all through. Then take it out, drain 
off the suds, and set the bottle in the sun, 
for the lace to dry on it. When it is quite 
dry, remove the lace from the bottle, and 
roll it round a wide ribbon block, if vou 

/ V 

have one ; otherwise, lay it in long folds, 
place it within a sheet of smooth white 
paper, and press it in a large book for a day 
or two. By this simple process, in which 
there is neither rinsing, starching, nor iron- 
ing, the lace will acquire the same consis- 
tence, transparency, and tint that it had 
when new, and the scollops at the edge will 
come out perfectly even. We can safely 
recommend this as the best possible method 
of doing up thread lace, and as the only one 



620 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

which gives it a truly new appearance. It 
is well not to put the oil on the lace till you 
have the soapsuds ready in the kettle, so 
that the bottle may go in immediately ; as 
if allowed to stand, much of the oil will run 
down and drip off. 



TO CLEAN WHITE FEATHERS. 

732. Draw the feathers gently through 
a warm soap lather several times, then pass 
them through tepid, and fin ally through cold 
water, to rinse them. Then hold them a 
short distance from the fire, and curl the 
separate parts of the feather as it dries by 
holding a steel knitting pin in the hand, 
and drawing each portion of the feather 
briskly between the pin and the thumb. 

THE purest, coldest maxims are poured down on 
us from pulpits, and authors, like flakes of snow ; 
but fast as they fall they do not prevent the volcano 
of our passions from burning. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 621 
TO TAKE OUT WAX. 

733. Hold a very hot iron near, but 

not on, the spot, till the wax melts. Then 

scrape it off. Lay a clean blotting paper 

over the place, and press it with a cooler 
iron till the wax has disappeared. 



TO SELECT FLOOR OIL CLOTHS. 

734. The best floor cloths are those 
painted on fine cloth, which should be well 
covered with color. If the figures rise much 
above the ground, they soon wear off. The 
durability of the cloth will depend much on 
the time the paint has been allowed to dry, 
as well as on the quality of the colors used. 
If the paint has not become sufficiently 
hardened, a very little use will deface the 
cloth. Old carpets answer very well for 
common floor cloths, if they are painted 
well and seasoned some months before they 
are laid down. 



622 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

TO CURL FEATHERS. 

735. Heat them gently before the fire ; 
then with the back of a knife applied to the 
feather, they will curl well and quickly. 
White feathers may be perfectly cleaned by 
washing in soft water with white soap and 
a squeeze of blue ; beat them against clean 
white paper, shake gently for a few minutes 
before the fire, then dry them in the air, 
and afterward curl them. Or, hold the 
feathers before a bright fire, and draw the 
back of a knife along the back of the feathers 
and they will curl again. 

CLEVER STUPIDITY. " James, my son, take this 
letter to the Post Office, and pay the postage.'' The 
boy returned highly elated, and said : " Father, I 
seed a lot of men putting letters in a little place, and 
when no one was looking, I slipped yours in for 
nothing." 



FOR TOOTHACHE. 

736. Take of choloform, spirits of cam- 
phor, and laudanum, each one drachm. 
Apply on a little cotton wool. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 623 

TO OBLITERATE WRITING. 

737. Recently written matter may be 
completely removed by oxymuriatic acid 
(concentrated and in solution). Wash the 
written paper repeatedly with acid, and 
afterward wash it with lime water, to neu- 
tralize any acid which may be left. The 
writing will be thus removed. If the writing 
is old, the preceding process will not be suf- 
ficiently efficacious, owing to the change 
which the ink has undergone. In such a 
case, the writing must be washed with sul- 
phate of ammonia, before the oxymuriatic 
acid is applied. It may then be washed 
with a hair pencil. 

A YOUNG divine, who was much given to enthusi- 
astic cant, one day said to Dr. Laythorpe, " Do you 
suppose that you have any real religion ?" " None 
to speak of " was the excellent reply. 



TO KEEP SILK. 

738. Silk articles should not be kept 
folded in white paper, as the chloride of lime 



624 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

used in bleaching the paper will probably 
impair the color of the silk. Brown paper 
is better ; the yellowish smooth India paper 
is best of all. 



TO RAISE THE CRUSH PILE OF VELVET. 

739. Hold the wrong side of the velvet 
over boiling water, and the pile of velvet 
will be gradually raised. 



CEMENT FOR BOTTLE CORKS. 

740. Melt yellow wax with an equal 
quantity of resin, or of common turpentine 
resin, to which add, when thoroughly 
mixed, one part of Venetian red, well 
dried. While warm, dip the neck of the 
bottle in so as to cover the cork and edge 
of the bottle with the wax. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 625 

TO DRIVE AWAY MTJSaUITOES. 

741. A camphor bag hung up in an 
open casement will prove an effectual bar- 
rier to their entrance. Camphorated spirits 
applied as perfume to the face and hands 
will prove an effectual preventive; but 
when bitten by them, aromatic vinegar is 
the best antidote. 



TO IMPROVE GILDING. 

742. Mix a gill of water with two 
ounces of purified nitre, one ounce of alum, 
and one ounce of common salt. Lay this 
over gilt articles with a brush, and their 
color will be much improved. 



CHEAP SIMPLE CERATE. 

743. Four parts lard, two parts white 
wax, and two parts spermaceti.

626 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

TO KEEP BREAD. 

744. When bread is perfectly cold it 
should be laid into a large covered earthen 
pan ; this should be kept free from crumbs, 
frequently scalded, and then wiped dry for 
use. Loaves which have been cut should 
have a small pan appropriated to them, and 
this also should have the loose crumbs 
wiped from it daily. The bread pans, in- 
stead of standing on the floor, should be 
placed upon a proper stand or frame made 
for the purpose, by means of two flat wedges 
of wood, so as to allow a current of air to 
pass under them. 

As the whirlwind in its fury teareth up trees and 
deformeth the face of nature ; or as an earthquake 
in its convulsions overturneth whole cities, so the 
rage of an angry man throweth mischief around 
him ; danger and destruction wait on his hand. 



USE OF SOOT. 

745. Peas may be preserved from 
destruction by mice by sowing soot with 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 627 

them ; and when the peas come up, if soot 
be sprinkled over them while they are 
damp, birds will not touch them. Soot is 
also invaluable for carnations and tulips in 
any ground where wire-worms abound. It 
is not only a destroyer of insects, but a rich 
manure. 

A CHIMNEY-SWEEPER'S boy went into a baker's 
shop for a two penny loaf, and conceiving it to be 
diminutive in size, remarked to the baker that he 
did not believe it was weight. "Never mind that," 
said the man of dough, "you will have the less to 
carry." " True," replied the lad, and throwing two 
cents on the counter, left the shop. The baker 
called after him, saying that he had not left money 
enough. "Never mind that," said young Sooty, 
"you will have the less to count." 



TO OBTAIN HERBS OF THE FINEST FLAVOR. 

746. When herbs are to be kept for 
flavoring dishes, it is obviously of the first 
importance that they should be gathered 
at the right time and dried in the best 
manner. 

Herbs should be gathered just before 



628 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

they begin to flower, on a dry day, before 
the sun has been long upon them. When 
intended for preservation they should be 
cleaned from dirt and dust, and dried 
gradually in a cool oven. The leaves 
should then be picked off, pounded in a 
mortar, passed through a hair sieve, and 
the powders be preserved separately in well- 
stopped bottles. 

THE newspapers are full of advertisements of 
plain cooks. Pretty cooks have no occasion to 
advertise. 



TO REMOVE GLASS STOPPERS. 

747. When the stopper of a glass 
decanter is too tight, a cloth wet with hot 
water, and applied to the neck, will cause 
the glass to expand, and the stopper may 
be removed. In a phial the warmth of 
the finger may be sufficient. 

Nothing can be more touching than to behold a 
soft and tender woman, who had been all weakneis 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 629 

and dependence while treading the prosperous paths 
of life, suddenly rising in mental force to be the 
comforter and supporter of her husband under mis- 
fortunes. As the vine which has long twined its 
graceful foliage about the oak, and been lifted by it 
into sunshine, will when the hardy tree is rifted by 
the thunder-bolts, cling round it with its caressing 
tendrils, and bind up its shattered boughs, so woman, 
who is the dependent and ornament of man in his 
happier hours, should be his stay and solace when 
smitten with sudden calamity. 



TO RESTORE BLACK CRAPE. 

748. Make scalding hot skim-milk and 
water, with a small piece of glue in it. 
Immerse faded and rusty black crape in 
this for a few minutes ; then take it out. 
clasp it in the hands and pull it dry, and 
it will look equal to new. 



RED, WHITE, OR BLACK VARNISH FOR 

BASKETS. 

749. Pulverize either red, white, or 
black sealing wax, sift it, put it in a phial 



630 TTTE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 

with enough spirits of wine to just cover 
it. Stand it in a very warm place for a 
couple of days, when it will be ready for 
use. 

"WHEN thou seest the naked wanderer of the 
street, shivering with cold, and destitute of habita- 
tion, let bounty open thine heart, let the wings of 
charity shelter him from death, and thine own soul 
may live." 



MEANS OF DOUBLING A CROP OF POTATOES 
WITHOUT INCREASED EXPENDITURE. 

750. A double crop of potatoes may 
be obtained by pursuing the following 
course : when the potatoes have come to 
maturity, take off the loose earth carefully 
without disturbing the old stem ; pick away 
the tubers that are fit for immediate use ; 
be careful not to disturb the main stalk, 
then cover over the small ones that are left, 
and add a little more earth. In about two 
months after, the latter crop will be more 
productive than the first. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 631 

" PAPA, I planted some potatoes in our garden," 
said one of the smart lads of this generation, " and 
what do you think came up ?" " Why, potatoes, of 
course." " No, indeed, there came up a drove of 
hogs and eat them allJ" 



THE ECONOMY OF DRIPPING-MEANS OF 
SAVING THE CONSUMPTION OF BUTTER. 

751. Well clarified dripping, when 
fresh and sweet, will baste every thing as 
well as butter, and should supply the place 
of butter for common pies, etc., for which 
it is equal to lard, especially if the clarify- 
ing be repeated twice over. If kept in a 
cool place, it may be preserved a fortnight 
in summer, and longer in winter. 

To clarify dripping, put it into a clean 
saucepan, over a stove or slow fire; as soon 
as a scum forms, skim it well, let it boil, 
let it stand till it is a little cooled, then 
pour it through a sieve into a pan. 

After frying, let the spare dripping stand 
a few minutes to settle, and then pour it 



632 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

through a sieve into a clean basin or stone 
pan, and it will do a second and a third 
time as well as it did the first ; but the fat 
in which fish has been fried, must not be 
used for any other purpose than frying 
other fish. 

WHY is hot bread like a caterpillar ? Because it 
is the grub that makes the butter fly ? 



TO PREVENT MOTH. 

752. The cuttings of Russia leather 
placed with furs, blankets, cloth, etc., will 
effectually prevent moth. Camphor is also 
a good thing. The article must be kept in 
a dry place, and free from dust. 



TO KILL MOTHS IN CARPETS. 

753. Wring a coarse cloth out of clean 
water, spread it smoothly on the part of the 
carpet where moths are suspected to be; 



THE YOUNG WIFE S COOK BOOK. 633 

with a hot iron send the steam from the 
wet cloth into the carpet. This process 
will not injure the pile of the carpet, if the 
iron is not pressed on too heavily. It is 
necessary to destroy the moth as well as 
the eggs. 



LIQUID GLUE. 

754. Take a wide-mouthed bottle, and 
dissolve in it eight ounces of the best glue 
in half a pint of water, by setting it in a 
vessel of water, and heating until dissolved. 
Then add, slowly, two and a half ounces of 
strong aqua fortis (nitric acid), stirring all 
the while. Keep it well corked, and it will 
be ready for use at any moment. This 
preparation does not gelatinize, nor undergo 
putrefaction nor fermentation. It is appli- 
cable for many domestic uses, such as 
mending china, repairing cabinet work, etc. 

RECENTLY, a clergyman, while announcing from 
his pulpit an appointment for the ladies of his con- 



634 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

gregation to meet at the Orphan's Asylum, on a 
beneficiary visit to the institution, closed the an- 
nouncement with the following words : " The ladies 
will take with them their own refreshments, so as 
not to eat up the orphans." 



WATERPROOF LEATHER BOOTS THAT WILL 
RESIST THE SEVEREST WEATHER. 

755. Take half a pint of linseed oil, 
and half a pint of neat's foot oil, and boil 
them together. Have the boots dry, and 
free from dirt, rub them well with this 
mixture before the fire, until completely 
saturated; set them by for two or three 
days after oiling the first time ; and after 
using, wash them clean from dirt, and oil 
when dry; or upon the feet, before going 
out. The soles of dress boots may be made 
impervious to wet or snow, by the same 
mixture. 

THE Rev. Dr. M was reputed for the suavity 

of his manners and his especial politeness toward 
the fair sex Handing a dish of honey to a lady, 
at a party at his house, he said in his wonted man- 
ner, " Do take a little honey, Miss ; 'tis so 

sweet, so like } T ourself." A Mr. Muddle, handing 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 635 

the butter dish to the host, exclaimed, " Do take a 
little butter, doctor ; 'tis so like yourself." 



YEAST CAKES, OR PRESERVED YEAST. 

756. Put a large handful of hops into 
two quarts of boiling water. Boil three 
large potatoes until they are tender. Mash 
them and add to them two pounds of flour. 
Pour the boiling hop water over the flour 
through a sieve or colander, and beat it 
until it is quite smooth. While it is warm, 
add two tablespoonfuls of salt, and half a 
teacupful of sugar. Before it is quite cold, 
stir in a pint or more of good yeast. After 
the yeast has become quite light, stir in as 
much Indian meal as it will take, roll it 
out in cakes, and place them on a cloth in 
a dry place, taking care to turn them every 
day. At the end of a week or ten days 
they may be put into a bag, and should be 
kept in a dry place. When used, take one 
of these cakes, soak it in some milk-warm 



636 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

water, mash it up smooth, and use it as any 
other kind of yeast. 

" WILLIAM," said a teacher to one of his pupils, 
" can you tell me why the sun rises in the east?" 
" Don't know, sir," replied William, " 'cept it be 
that east makes every thing rise." 



DEAFNESS IN OLD PERSONS. 

757. This is usually accompanied with 
confused sounds, and noises of various 
kinds in the inside of the ear itself. In 
such cases, insert a piece of cotton wool, 
on which a very little oil of cloves or cin- 
namon has been dropped, or which has 
been dipped in equal parts of aromatic spirit 
of ammonia and tincture of lavender. The 
ear trumpet ought likewise to be occasion- 
ally used. 

How lamentable that we should go through the 
world so misunderstanding one another ; letting 
slip golden opportunities for glimpses into men's 
better nature, which might have knit our hearts to 
theirs for ever in a brotherhood of love, and drawn 
the veil of charity over faults which, in our blind- 
ness, seemed to us without a virtue to balance them. 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 637 

Angels turn sorrowing away from this sour blind- 
ness of ours, and fiends laugh over the final fall of 
despair which our helping hand might at such mo- 
ments have averted. Well for us all ; it is that he 
who is himself without sin, more merciful than man, 
sees gathering tears in eyes that we deem hard and 
dry. 



ALUM CURD. 

758. Put the white of an egg in a plate, 
and with a lump of alum rub the egg until 
a thick curd is formed ; the curd is some- 
times used as a poultice for an inflammation 
of the eyes. 

AN old bachelor says that he is delighted at 
having been called " honey" by the girl he loves, 
because she saluted him at their last meeting as old 
" Bees-wax I" 



THE POTATO REMEDY FOR RHEUMATISM. 

759. It is asserted by some, that a raw 
potato, carried habitually in the pocket, is 
an effectual preventive of rheumatism. 



638 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 
TO AVOID CHILBLAINS. 

760. Commence early, before frost sets 
in, to rub the feet and hands with opodeldoc 
(soap liniment) ; this should be done night 
and morning; keep the feet and hands par- 
ticularly dry, using abundant friction after 
washing, and take plenty of exercise to pro- 
mote circulation. It is the want of the lat- 
ter, as much as any other cause, which 
induces chilblains. Never approach the 
fire immediately after coming in-doors from 
the frosty air. A skipping-rope affords 
admirable house exercise for children, and 
will effectually keep away chilblains, as 
well as many other complaints, if made 
timely use of. 

MORE WAYS THAN ONE. A naughty little boy, 
only six years of age, was in the habit of asking 
money from all the gentlemen who came to see his 
father. The latter, in indignation, made him pro- 
mise, under pain of punishment, not to ask any 
more of an} 7 one. The next day came his father's 
partner ; and the boy, in order not to break the 
promise, said to him, " Do you know any one who 
would lend me a half-penny without ever requiring 
it back again ?" 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 639 

TO DESTROY VERMIN, 

761. Small vermin of all kinds may be 
killed and effectually cleared out of their 
favorite resorts by the free use of burning 
fluid. Caution, however, must be used in 
its application to woodwork, as it injures 
paint. 

BEMUS asked Jemima, a few days since, if she 
had seen her vegetable friend ? " My vegetable 
friend ! who's that ?" " Wiry, the } T oung man I met 
with you yesterday 1 who has carrotty hair, reddish 
whiskers, a turn-up nose, and is full of capers." 



RED WASH FOR BRICK PAVEMENT. 

762. Dissolve an ounce of glue, and 
to this add half a pound of Venetian red, 
one pound of Spanish brown, and sufficient 
hot water to make a thin wash. 



TO PREVENT LAMP SMOKE. 

763. Lay the lamp-wicks in vinegar for 
an hour, dry them well before they are used. 



640 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

A CUBAN physician having been robbed to a se- 
rious extent in his tobacco-works, discovered the 
thief by the following ingenious artifice. Having 
called his negro slaves together, he addressed them 
thus: "My friends, the Great Spirit appeared to 
me during the night, and told me that the person 
who stole my money should, at this instant this 
very instant have a parrot's feather at the point of 
his nose." On this announcement, the thief, anx- 
ious to find out if his guilt had declared itself, put 
his finger to his nose. " Man," cried the master 
instantly, " 'tis thou who hast robbed me. The 
Great Spirit has just told me so." 



TO DESTROY RATS AND MICE. 

764. Mix some ground plaster of Paris 
with brown sugar and Indian meal. Set 
it about on old plates, and leave beside 
each plate, a saucer or pan of water. When 
the rats have eaten the mixture they will 
drink the water and die. To attract them 
toward it, you may sprinkle on the edges 
of the plates a little of the oil of rhodium. 
Another method of getting rid of rats is, 
to strew pounded potash in their holes. 
The potash gets into their coats, and 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 641 

irritates their skin, and the rats desert the 
place. 

To prevent rats dying in their holes and 
becoming offensive, poison them by mixing 
half a pound of Carbonate of Barytes with a 
quarter of a pound of lard. It produces 
great thirst, the rats leave their holes to 
drink, and are unable to return. 







TO EXTINGUISH FIRE IN A CHIMNEY 

765. Shut the doors and windows and 
throw some powdered brimstone on the fire, 
and stop up the front of the chimney to pre- 
vent the fumes from entering the room. 
The vapor of the brimstone ascending the 
chimney will effectually extinguish the 
flame. If brimstone is not at hand, throw 
some salt on the fire. 



TO COOL A ROOM, 

766. The simplest and cheapest way to 
cool a room is to wet a cloth of any size, 



40 



642 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

the larger the better, and suspend it in the 
place you want cooled. Let the room be 
well ventilated, and the temperature will 
sink from ten to twenty degrees in less than 
an hour. This is the plan adopted by many 
eastern nations. 



TINCTURE FROM SCRAPS OF LEMON-PEEL. 

767. Fill a wide-mouthed pint bottle 
half full of brandy, or proof spirits, and 
whenever you have bits of waste lemon 
rind, pare the yellow part very thin, and 
drop it into the brandy. This will strongly 
impregnate the spirit with essence of lemon, 
and form an excellent flavoring for tarts, 
custards, etc. 

IN a party of ladies, on its being reported that a 
Captain Silk had arrived in town, they exclaimed, 
with one exception, " What a name for a soldier !" 
" The fittest name in the world for a Captain," re- 
joined the witty one; "for silk can never be 
worsted." 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 643 
A NIGHT-CAP MADE IN A MOMENT. 

768. Take your pocket-handkerchief, 
and laying it out the full square, double 
down one third over the other part. Then 
raise the whole, and turn it over, so that 
the third folded down shall lie underneath. 
Then take hold of one of the folded corners, 
and draw its point toward the centre ; then 
do the same with the other, as in making a 
cocked hat, or a boat of paper. Then take 
hold of the two remaining corners, and 
twisting the hem of the handkerchief, con- 
tinue to roll it until it meets the doubled 
corners brought to the centre and catches 
them up a little. Lift the whole and you 
will see the form of a cap, which, when 
applied to the head, will cover the head and 
ears, and being tied under the chin, will not 
come off. Very little practice will enable a 
person to regulate the size of the folds, so as 
to suit the head. 

A VENERABLE lady of a celebrated physician, one 
day casting her eye out of the window, observed 
her husband in the funeral procession of one of his 



644 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

patients, at which she exclaimed : " I do wish my 
husband would keep away from such processions ; 
it appears too much like a tailor carrying home his 
work." 



RED CEMENT. 

769. The red cement used for uniting 
glass to metals, is made by melting five 
parts of black resin and one part of yellow 
wax ; when entirely melted, stir in gradually, 
one part of red ochre, or Venetian red in fine 
powder, and previously well dried. This 
cement should be melted before it is used, 
and it adheres better if the objects to which 
it is applied are warmed. 

HE that is angry without a cause, 
Must get pleased without amends. 



DR. JOHNSON'S RECEIPT FOR RHEUMATISM. 

770. Take of flowers of sulphur, flour 
of mustard, each half an ounce ; honey or 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 645 

molasses, a sufficient quantity to form an 
electuary. The size of a nutmeg to be taken 
several times a day, drinking after it a 
quarter of a pint of the decoction of lovage 
root. 

THE quantity of water consumed daily in London 
is equal to the contents of a lake fifty acres in ex- 
tent, and of a mean depth of three feet. This 
quantity is by no means proportionate to the great 
and growing wants of the population. According 
to the last returns, there were seventy thousand 
houses without any supply whatever. 



ACORN TREES. 

771. Very pretty ornaments for the 
parlor may be produced by setting acorns 
to germinate in hyacinth glasses, and 
placing them over the mantel-piece. Half 
fill with rain water, a white glass, one of 
those usually employed for bulbous roots. 
Take a ripe acorn, which has been for a day 
or two steeped in rain water, or in damp 
moss or mould ; with the aid of a piece of 



646 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

cork or cardboard suspend the acorn about 
a quarter of an inch above the water. Let 
the cork or cardboard fit the mouth of the 
glass tightly, so as to exclude the air. In a 
few weeks the acorns will begin to grow, 
and the interesting process of the germina- 
tion of one of our noblest trees may be 
watched from time to time. When the 
leaves reach the cork another arrangement 
must be adopted ; the acorn must be raised, 
the leaves be pushed through the cork or 
cardboard, leaving the young plant suspen- 
ded. Should the water become green or 
turbid, it must be changed ; and if any 
fungi appear upon the acorn, they must be 
carefully brushed or wiped away. The oak 
plants thus produced will, with attention, 
flourish for two or three years the most 
important points for their preservation being 
the changing of the water, and the cleans- 
ing of the roots when fungous plants appear. 
When the acorns are first put to grow, 
nothing must be done to them except re- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 647 

moving the cup ; the shell of the acorn must 
be uninjured. 

SIR Thomas Overbury says that the man who has 
nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestors, 
is like a potato the only good thing belonging to 
him is under ground. 



TO PREVENT INSECTS CLIMBING UP FRUIT 

TREES. 

772. Let a piece of India rubber be 
burnt over a gallipot, into which it will 
gradually drop, in the condition of a thick 
viscid juice, which state it will retain for 
any length of time. Having melted the 
India rubber, let a piece of cord, or worsted 
be smeared w r ith it, and then tied several 
times round the trunk of the tree. The 
melted substance is so very sticky, that the 
insects will be prevented, and generally 
captured in their attempts to pass over it. 

A SCIENTIFIC vouth has discovered the cause of 

V 

the potato disease. He ascribes it to the rot-tator-y 
movement 1 



6-18 THE YOUNG WIFF/S COOK BOOK. 

COAL ASHES USEFUL FOR MAKING GARDEN 

WALKS, 

773. To three bushels of coal ashes, not 
sifted very fine, add one bushel of very fine 
gravel. Add water to these, and mix them 
until they become about as soft as mortar. 
Spread over the walks, the surface of which 
should previously be slightly broken and 
raked smooth. Make the mortar-like mix- 
ture smooth and even by spreading it with 
a piece of board. It will become hard in 
a few days. 

THERE are a good many people in the world who 
spend half their time in thinking what they would 
do if they were rich, and the other half in conjec- 
turing what they shall do as they are not. 



PEA VINES A WINTER ORNAMENT. 

774. Fill a wide-mouthed glass jar 
with water, and cover it over with a piece 
of " foundation," (the ladies will understand 
this,) cover that over with a layer of peas, 



THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 649 

pressing it down so that the peas will lie in 
the water ; they will then swell and sprout, 
the roots growing down into the water, 
their fine fibres presenting a beautiful ap- 
pearance ; set this in a window, and vines 
will grow up which can be conducted to 
any height. 



HOW TO GROW LARGE POTATOES. 

775. To improve the size of potatoes, 
whether planted with small or large, whole 
or even-cut tubers, when the plants are 
only a few inches high, let the shoots be 
reduced by pulling them up to one, two, or 
at most, three of the strongest. The tubers 
will consequently be fewer, and very much 
larger, also, in measure, nearly all fit for the 
table or the market. Growers may assure 
themselves of the efficacy of this method, 
by first experimenting upon a few rows. 

THE following is a copy of an excuse recently 



650 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

handed in to a schoolmaster for the non-attendance 
of one of his scholars: " Cepatomtogoataturing." 
Kept at home to go a-taturing ! 



REMEDY FOR FROZEN POTATOES. 

776. In the time of frosts, potatoes 
that have been affected thereby, should be 
laid in a perfectly dark place for some days 
after the thaw has commenced. If thawed 
in open day, they rot ; but if in darkness, 
they do not rot ; and they lose very little 
of their natural properties. 



POTATOES SLIGHTLY DISEASED PRESERVED 
BY PEAT CHARCOAL. 

777. When potatoes are slightly dis- 
eased, sprinkling peat charcoal among them, 
instantly stays the rot, takes away the bad 
smell, and renders them sweet and whole- 
some food. Potatoes may be kept in this 
way two years, and when planted the third, 
they will produce a good crop. The char- 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 651 

coal will also prevent the sound potatoes 
from being infected by the diseased ones. 
The charcoal need not be lost ; it may be 
mixed with other manures when the pota- 
toes are removed. 



* 



TO DESTROY BUGS. 

778. An effectual mode of destroying 
these offensive insects is to brush over the 
beds, walls, or floors infested with them, 
with oil of turpentine, which is equally de- 
structive to the insect and to its eggs. One 
of the best remedies and preventives for 
bed-bugs is to procure from a druggist an 
ounce of quicksilver, and beat it in a mortar 
to a strong froth, with the whites of two 
eggs : or if you wish it very powerful, and 
thick like an ointment, use the white of one 
egg only. If liquid, spread it with the 
feather of a quill : or, what is still better, 
with a large old camel's hair brush, all over 
the cracks and pins of the bedstead, not 



652 THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

forgetting the under side of all the joints, 
and see that it penetrates thoroughly. If 
you have made an ointment of it, rub it off 
with your finger. This is considered a still 
better remedy than the common mercurial 
ointment, but cannot always be as promptly 
obtained. 

In a new house, where the habits of the 
family are neat, and a general attention is 
paid to cleanliness throughout, there will be 
little danger of bed-bugs ; but on removing 
to an old house which has had various occu- 
pants, these disgusting and intolerable in- 
sects frequently make their appearance with 
the commencement of the warm weather, 
and sometimes before, from having been un- 
pardonably allowed to get possession even 
of the crevices of the wood-work on the 
walls ; and if the chambers are papered, 
they often contrive to effect a lodgment 
between the edges of the paper and the 
plastering. If bugs are found in the crev- 
ices of an old house, their haunts should be 



THE YOUNG WIFE'S COOK BOOK. 653 

well washed with a strong decoction of 
tobacco, boiled in water, or with a decoction 
of red peppers. If these washes (which by 
frequent repetition generally succeed) should 
fail to destroy them, the crevices, as a last 
resource, should be rubbed with quicksilver 
beaten up with the white of an egg ; and 
afterward filled up with putty or wadding, 
or with quick-lime mixed with water. 

Another mode of destroying the vermin 
is, a saturated solution of alum applied hot, 
with a brush, to every joint and crevice that 
can possibly harbor them. Spirits of naph- 
tha, also, applied in the same way, but cold, 
has been found effectual. 

A most effectual remedy against bugs is to 
have all the bedsteads in the house taken 
down, and after washing the joints with 
cold water and brown soap, to have the 
whole bedstead completely varnished, even 
on the inside of the joint. 

In very bad cases, where the whole room, 
walls, floors, and ceilings, are infested, the 



654 THE YOUNG FIFE'S COOK BOOK. 

only effectual remedy is fumigation. Re- 
move every thing from the room that you 
are satisfied is perfectly free from the vermin, 
then close every opening, and even every 
chink and crevice in the room that might 
admit air ; pasting paper over the joints of 
the doors, etc. Then cut up four ounces of 
brimstone into an iron pan, light some slips 
of linen dipped in brimstone, and place them 
in the pan, leaving the room without delay, 
closing the door and covering even the 
key-hole. In twenty-four hours no living 
creature will exist in the apartment. 



RECEIPT FOR PRESERVING AND MAKING 
LEATHER WATERPROOF. 

779. One part tallow, one part best sperm 
oil, one part tar, melt the whole and apply 
to the leather; while hot, make repeated 
applications until the leather is saturated. 
You can apply the above in its boiling state 
to leather without fear of injuring it.
