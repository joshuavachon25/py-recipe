PREFACE. 




* ERE I to dedicate this book, it would be to 
the Homesick ; that class, which, above all 
others on earth, has suffered so hopelessly, 
been so little understood by those who 
have escaped this mind disease. How it 
eats out the hopes and aspirations and 
longings of its victims, and leaves them 
bound to the Promethean rock of loneli- ' 
ness, only those know who are its victims. 

Were I to dedicate my book to the homesick, it would be 
consecrated to thousands upon thousands of little children, 
who among strangers pine to be at home, to whom the 
school is the prison-house, the distant home the heaven 
they long to reach ; to the lonely orphans found in insti- 
tutions where the charity of strangers gives them food and 
raiment, but not a mother's love, a father's presence or a 
home's liberty ; to the over-worked men and women, who 
are exiles to home blessings through poverty ; to the aged 
ones who have outlived their kindred, and have no abiding 
place at any hearthstone ; to the greater part of all God's 
creatures, in fact, for few, indeed, are so happy as to have 

m 



It PREFACE. 

lived, and not suffered from this cause. All its cruel phases 
and manifestations, its blighting power and tenacious grasp, 
were realized by Payne, who spoke for the homesick when he 
penned his " Home, Sweet Home." He touched the univer- 
sal heart with his poem made immortal in song, and it seems 
fitting that in a book on the subject, nothing could be more 
appropriate than a picture of the fireside where he lived as 
a little child. This the beautiful frontispiece gives, and in 
gazing upon it may be realized the charm that hallowed the 
name to him. In the words of the song that has made his name 
dear to his kind, he did not teach, he but voiced the univer- 
sal sentiment ; the love that comprehends that of mother, 
father, sister, brother, of prosperity and contentment. 

Surely a word so potent has a deeper significance than 
any other in our language. To have a home in the fullest 
sense is to be blessed ; to be in heaven while yet on earth. 
From out of happy homes come all the true men and women 
the world possesses. The noblest and best of the race 
have been and can Only be the products of happy homes. 
The fetters that bind us to home are the cords that connect 
us with all true progress and right development. The hap- 
piness of a well-organized home is reflected in the lives of 
all men and women who come in contact with its inmates. 
We cannot, do not live unto ourselves alone : the world is the 
better or otherwise for our being in it. Home is the cen- 
tral point of all happiness ; the pivot upon which depends 
the weal or the woe of families and communities. What 
then so important as the right building of our earthly homes 
in all spiritual and practical ways? What subject so fraught 
with great consequences as the Hearthstone? 

Verily, if we have ideals, let them be in this direction ; and 



PREFACE. 



let them be so developed that when we have passed from the 
earthly home, it may be to find the spiritual one a facsimile 
of that which we have wrought in fancy here, and loved and 
longed to attain ; a veritable Hearthstone, about which will 
be gathered the friends of old, the memories of the past, 
the essence of every aspiration and anticipation.

THE HEARTHSTONE; oUIFE AT HOME, 



HOMES, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

" What's a house ? You may buy it, or build it, or rent, 
It may be a mansion, a cottage, a tent-; 
Its furniture costly, or humble and mean ; 
High walls may surround it, or meadows of green j 
Tall servants in livery stand in the hall. 
Or but one little maiden may wait on you all ; 
The table may groan with rich viands and rare. 
Or potatoes and bread be its costliest fare. 
The inmates may glitter in purple and gold. 
Or their raiment be homely and tattered and old. 
'Tis a house, and no more, which vile money may buy; 
It may ring with a laugh or but echo a sigh. 

" But a home must be warmed with the embers of love. 
Which none from its hearthstone may ever remove. 
And be lighted at eve with a heart-kindled smile. 
Which a breast, though in sorrow, of woe may beguile. 
A home must be ' Home,' for no words can express it — 
Unless you have known it, you never can guess it; 
'Tis in vain to describe what it means to a heart 
Which can live out its life on the bubbles of art. 
It may be a palace, it may be a cot, 
It matters not which and it matters not what ; 
'Tis a dwelling perfumed with the incense of love, 
A beautiful type of the home that's above." 

JHERE are some perfumes so aromatic that one need 
not uncork the bottle that contains them to have our 
clothes and rooms and furniture made fragrant by 
them. They find their way through thick glass dnd 
wood, and yet do not evaporate or decrease, but re- 
main the same in bulk, although fragrance is always 
distilling from them and sweetening everything around them. So if 
is with the word' Home. There is no other word in any dictionary 

(25) 




26 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

that IS so precious, so all-pervading and so full of tenderest memory 
and affection. If there be any nation that is without a word for home 
in its vocabulary, then we may be sure that it has no name for God, 
for heaven, and for those unselfish virtues and mutual influences 
which make the crown of our humanity. Indeed, so intimately is 
the idea of home associated with that of God, on the one hand, and 
of humanity on the other, that the ancient heathen had their gods 
in their homesteads, like family relics and heirlooms. At the siege 
of Troy, .(Eneas and his father, Anchises, are chiefly anxious to save 
and carry away with them, in their exile from the ruined home, their 
Penates, or household gods, as soon as they have seen to it that the 
little lad lulus is safe. All religions worthy of the name have had 
home as their subjective, and God as their objective, basis. So in- 
timately are these two ideas interwoven that it is quite as true to 
define man as a home-building and home-loving as a God-fearing or 
worshipping being. The original idea that the ancients had in 
building temples and churches was to make a home for God, or the 
gods among whom they divided the attributes of Creator and Pro- 
tector. David is no sooner called away from the sheepfolds than he 
is possessed with the grand enterprise of the temple on Mount Zion. 
The palace, the splendid home for himself, does not satisfy him, so 
long as the Deity to whom he owes his life and fortunes has no 
national sanctuary. He resolves to take no rest for his eyes nor 
slumber for his eyelids until he has found out a home for his Lord, 
a " habitation " for the God of Israel. And when his son Solomon 
completed the grand cathedral which his father had begun, his as- 
piration is that God will accept it as an earthly cottage not worthy, 
of course, of Him who dwelleth in the heavens, but still well furnished 
and complete, having in it the perpetual fires and incense of home 
and the voices of prayer and joy and sadness that sound so home- 
like. David even rejoiced at the thought that its very minarets and 
towers would be homes for the birds that were wanderers in the sky. 
Its altars were to afford the swallow a home and the sparrow a nest 
for her little ones. 



HOMES, ANCIENT AND MODERN. IJ 

Home is written on the heaven above us and the earth beneath. 
Said Rowland Taylor, as he walked, from London to his dear parish 
of Hadley, within whose limits he was to be burned alive for his re- 
ligious opinions in the dark days of Mary and of Bonner, " There are 
but one or two stiles more for us to climb over and then I shall be 
home." It cheered the good man's heart that since he had to die he 
was to die near home. To be away from home, either when full of 
life or when expecting death, is to be lonely and to feel a void in 
one's heart. Hence, in one of the most beautiful of modern hymns 
or sacred poems, " Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom," 
John Henry Newman gives expression to this loneliness of feeling 
when he says, 

" The night is dark and I am far from home." 

Who of my readers has not felt the magic influence of John 
Howard Payne's world-famous song of " Home, sweet home " ? The 
secret of its popularity is not in any special excellence of meter, or 
even originality of thought. Rather it is the utter absence of origin- 
ality that makes it universal. It merely voices in simple strain the 
melody of every human heart since the first home was built on earth 
till now. It is a subject that never tires, but has eternal memory and 
hope in it. Home is a talisman, and we whisper the word in our own 
hearts and wear the thought of if about us like a charm or amulet. 
Like a spring gushing through hard rocks it sparkles with constantly 
renewed freshness, and our hearts yearn toward it, 

" As for some dear familiar straitr 
Untired we ask and ask again, 
Ever, in its melodious store. 
Finding a spell unheard before.'' 

Whenever the time comes to a young man that he ceases to loye 
the home of his parents and his childhood, he may be sure that 
there is something wrong with him, and that morally he is on a 
downward track. The first symptom of the loss of purity of heart 
in a youth is when he begins to speak disparagingly or unfilially of 
home. The greatest men in the history of this and every other 



28 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

country have been and still are those who cling with the strongest 
affection to the scenes and memories of their childhood. The good 
old patriarchal or domestic sentiment can afford to be sneered at, for 
its power is confessed by all of us at last. The prodigal son may 
take his portion of the common stock and turn it into money, which 
he finds to be very hard cash indeed when he has squandered it in 
dissipation, but when he comes to himself, and his better nature and 
real manhood assert themselves, he feels that the best thing he can 
do is to go home. Too often, however, regret is felt too late, or it is 
too late to reinstate himself He enters the old village with sad mis- 
givings, and when he looks at the old home he finds it changed, and 
instinct tells him that other hearts than those he loved inhabit it, and 
that other hands than those that once caressed him have changed ii:s 
style and aspect. He asks, like Joseph, if the old man is yet alive, 
and soon learns that all there is remaining of his home is beneath 
the mounds in the village churchyard. Fiction has never exceeded 
in description the real despair and solitude of the homeless man. 

We can remember such a case, which is but typical of many 
thousands of others. A young lad who had been gently born and 
nurtured contracted the youthful fever of love of adventure and dis- 
like of regular living. Like ambition the adventurous spirit is not to 
be condemned, for without it where would have been the discoverers 
and heroes of the world ? But with many lads it is a mere mock 
hriroism, and only shame prevents them from turning back, and con- 
fessing as much, before they have got fairly out of sight of the curl- 
ing smoke of the home chimney. For once that the voice of one's 
good angel whispers 

" Turn again, Whittington, 
Lord Mayor of London !" 

obedience to which leads on to fortune, there are a thousand cases 
where the voice says, " Turn again," in another sense, and bids us re- 
trace our footsteps and go home again. The wilful, generous-hearted 
lad we have in memory was touched with the contagion of adven- 
ture, and, in spite of all advice and kinden treaty, would go to sea. 



HOMES, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 29 

But of, the sea he tired after one outbound voyage, and then ran off 
"to the diggings" in Australia. Next he was a sheep farmer, but 
he lost all that he made. Sadder and wiser he worked his way 
home again before the mast. But what did he find ? His father and 
mother both dead, murmuring the wanderer's name with their last 
breath, and the old homestead pulled down to make way for a rail- 
road. The bronzed and weather-beaten man, not yet much past 
thirty, visited his parents'- graves, and no doubt shed tears as he re- 
called their looks and voices and all their goodness to him in his 
early years. From the churchyard he strolled a mile to the gram- 
mar school where he had learned his mother tongue on paper and 
the elements of Latin and mathematics. The old porch and the dor- 
mitories and the long school-room and the playground were all there ; 
but all the living associations were gone. The old Head Master was 
dead ; his assistant teachers were all gone and scattered none knew 
where. He might have sighed with gentle Charles Lamb : 

" I have had playmates, I have had companions. 
In my days of childhood, in my joyful school-days ; 
All, all are gene, the old familiar faces. 

" Ghost-like, I paced round the haunts of my childhood, 
Earth seemed a desert I wras bound to traverse. 
Seeking to find the old familiar faces. 

" How some they have died, and some they nave left me, 
And some are taken from me; all are departed; 
All, all are gone, the old familiar faces." 

Afterward, when his thoughts grew calmer and he was able from 
one source or another to glean some personal intelligence of his 
companions and schoolfellows, he found that one was a great Senator, 
another a bishop, and another a chief-justice, while he himself had 
but given another example to the proverb that " a rolling stone 
gathers no moss," and that " the lane called By-and-By leads to the 
house of Never." 

Sometimes, however, the spirit of adventure is not mere restlessness 



30 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

and impatience, but is the true outcome of a brave heart and stead- 
fast will. But in such cases there is no eagerness to get away from 
home. That is a hard wrench, and is only undergone as a painful 
duty. Indeed, the test of its being one's duty to leave home is often 
the pain it costs us to do so. If we wish to go away we ought to 
make quite sure that we are right in going ; but if it almost breaks 
our heart to part from all that has made our past life dear to us, we 
should listen attentively when duty bids, or seems to bid us go. In 
such cases even the wide ocean does not part us wholly from our 
home, either by night or day. The dying soldier on the distant 
battle-field, the shipwrecked sailor, the merchant in a foreign land, 
all think lovingly of the old home. There is nothing more worthy 
of admiration in the scantily educated domestic servants who come 
to this country from Germany or Ireland than the self-denying affec- 
tion with which they save their little earnings that they may send 
help to " the old folks at home." Statistics show that the money 
sent by hard-working servants through the post-office amounts 
to a very large sum every year. Surely these faithful hearts deserve 
and will one day possess a " home of their own." 

There is a class of persons, although not, it is to be hoped, a very 
large one, who are without natural affection, to use a Pauline phrase, 
and so are incapable of loving or caring for a home. As the Latin 
proverb describes the man who is " never less alone than when 
alone," so one may describe such misanthropic members of the 
human family as never less at home than when at home. And not 
only are such cross-grained creatures never at home themselves, but 
they prevent others from feeling at home in their presence. One ill- 
conditioned and sour-tempered inmate can blight the peace and 
happiness of a home. As " one touch of nature makes the whole 
world kin," so the touch of ill-nature can make everything unkind. 

Do we sufficiently instill into our children the love of home and 
all that home connotes and stands for ? The best way to make the 
young ones love it is to make it as cheery and pleasant for them as 
we can. It is a fact which the student of social life can scarcely 



HOMES, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 3 1 

avoid noticing, that the sons of particularly pious and straight-laced 
parents are generally much worse behaved when they get their liberty 
than those who have been brought up in an atmosphere of rational 
liberty and candor. One may see many a gray head being bowed 
down in sorrow towards the grave on account of the disgrace and 
anxiety brought upon a family by a son's profligacy or dishonesty. 
Some of these unworthy sons of Christian parents have gone so far 
in criminality as to pull up suddenly inside of a prison ; but others 
who have been smart enough to avoid legal consequences have none 
the less branded themselves for life with a mark upon their foreheads 
as indelible as that of Cain. Surely there is some show of reason 
in the suspicion that the being compelled to be, or feign to be, 
"righteous overmuch" in their boyhood, has made them when they 
were able to throw off the mask of hypocrisy stand out the more 
conspicuously in their real character. 

Some social philosophers have argued from such cases that to 
instill the principles of religion into a child is to make him a hypo- 
crite in the nature of things, and hence they have condemned the 
habit of attendance at public worship, and still more that of domestic 
worship or " family prayer." This seems to us to carry the argument 
too far, for if there are dozens, or even hundreds, of cases where the 
apparent effect of early religious training upon the subsequent 
conduct has been bad, there are thousands where it has strengthened 
the will, kept guard over the passions, and preserved the body and 
mind in purity and integrity. Who can think that such home 
religion and daily prayers and study of Scripture as those in William 
Wilberforce's household had a pernicious effect upon his children ? 
In religious belief most of them ran to the opposite extreme from 
that of their father, but in conduct they never disgraced their early 
training. 

It should be the ambition of every youth to be a successful home 
builder, and to earn by early industry a home of his own. It is 
dreary work to spend all one's life in sowing that others may reap. 
It is quite true that 



32 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

" H« who by the plough would thrive, 
Himself must either hold or drive ; " 

but the converse is not less true that he who holds or drives the 
plough ought also himself to thrive by it. This is the great social 
difficulty and problem that is shaking society to its centre. Alien 
proprietorship and a tenantry of serfs have had their day, but that 
day is passing away we trust forever. Education is now within the 
reach of all, and it was only the want of education on the one side^ 
that made them the social bondmen and mere hirelings of the other. 
The troubles in Ireland are the result of centuries of this unfair and 
unnatural inequality. The distinctions of rich and poor must always 
exist, because riches and poverty are relative, not absolute, conditions ; 
but that the rich should be idle and have luxuries, while the poor 
work hard and want for bread, is an atrocious and rotten state of things, 
and one that cannot last in an age of such decisive progress and 
prompt action as our own. The day cannot be distant when eveiy 
cultivator of the soil will have a home of his own ; but agrarian out- 
rages and murders postpone rather than hasten that good time. 

The Germans and the English have been, of all nationalities, the 
most conspicuous for their love of home. In a newer country, whose 
extent is so much greater and where travel is so much longer and 
more frequent, the home and its central fires are not so easy to pre- 
serve. Americans have to make new homes far distant from each 
other. But perhaps this necessity of frequent migration makes them 
cherish the ideal of home the more. It is a restless, homeless, and 
unsatisfying way, that of living in hotels. Strange faces, however 
pleasant and kindly, do not fill the place of the old familiar faces. 
The banquet of a palace in which one is a guest by courtesy never 
tastes as sweet as the social meal in our own home does. We hear 
men boast of travel and having no continuing city, and flitting from 
place to place and seeing new sights and mixing with strange people ; 
but to be a citizen of the world is not so good as the citizenship of 
the home circle and the home fireside. Those who get tired of 
housekeeping live with less trouble in a boarding-house, But what 



HOMES, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 33 

they save in trouble they lose in comfort. Chiefly, they miss that 
privacy which is the sacred heritage of family life. The old English 
proverb that "a man's house is his castle" expresses this. In his 
own home he is safe from intrusion, " monarch of all he surveys," 
master of his own times and ways. Republicanism is good in 
national government, but not at meal times, or when one is reading, 
writing, or resting, and needs quiet and security from intrusion. 
Hence, of the All-Father it is said that " He setteth the solitary in 
families," and " maketh Him households like a flock of sheep," and 
sheep love their own company and their own shepherd, and know not 
the voice of a stranger. There arc social marks and ways by which 
one can soon distinguish the man, woman, or child who has a happy 
home, from those whose life is all spent in publicity, amid noise and 
glare, without a parenthesis of introspection, reflection, private study, 
and home surroundings. 

If the home-building and home-sustaining man develops nobler 
traits of character and is of kindlier mould than the human bird 
of passage, however rich his plumage, so the woman who finds a 
field for her affections and unselfishness in home is truly beneficent 
and beautiful. If it be the man's part to lay the foundations and 
erect the building, it is hers to beautify the walls and enshrine music 
and the kindly arts within them. It is his to build and hers to 
beautify. If there be some " lost arts " which adorned ancient homes, 
but in which modern homes are wanting, it is hers to restore and 
bring them back. It is woman who informs the home with light and 
life. Her hand it is that decorates and adorns, that culls and twines 
the flowers and leaves, and lets in "'sweetness and light" into the 
rooms. Her hand it is that is cunning in the needlework and makes 
even the homeliest fare tempting in look and taste. Her touch is that 
of a purifying, transforming, and beautifying angel in the home, or 
like the magic wand of Cinderella's fairy godmother that transfigured 
the neglected and ill-clad child into a maiden " fair to see,'' decked 
with taste and loveliness, to grace a palace and to win a prince. 

Palace and prince, however, are both superfluous in the true fairy 
3 



34 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

tale of home. Genuine aesthetics have their place in the simple cottage 
not less than in the mansion which oppresses one by its splendor. 
The touch of the Master of Life could raise the poor man's as well 
as the nobleman's child to renewed life and strength. There is often 
more true life as well as more true love in a cottage than in kings' 
houses, and the true aesthetic touch does not need the purple and fine 
linen for a fabric. 

Amid a great deal that is trite and threadbare in Mr. Oscar Wilde's 
lectures, there is one remark which, although it has been uttered and 
thought a thousand times, cannot be repeated too often. It is that 
our American stoves and furnaces are destructive of the perfect ideal 
of a home. One might fill a volume instead of a page with the 
reminiscences and associations that gather around the old grate fire, 
or the still older log upon the hearth. But one cannot by any stretch 
of imagination conceive a happy thought or genuine inspiration to 
have been suggested by, or derived from, the modern stove or 
heater. It is " an abomination of desolation standing where it ought 
not." Who does not recall, with never fading pleasure, the dear old 
home-fires of the " auld lang syne." We see ourself in memory's 
mirror as we write, a musing, solitary child, looking and never tired 
of looking, at the nursery fire. Those were the days of unleavened 
bread, when life had not fermented, and all the chambers of imagery 
were filled with visions bright and beautiful. In the twilight, seated 
on our hassock, and with folded hands, we saw the angels and the 
fairies, the " cloud-capp'd towers and gorgeous palaces " of a world 
all our own, in which sin and sorrow were not, nor evil persons nor 
evil thoughts. But there is no augury in a stove ; divination is in 
the fire, not in the heat. There were poems and romances, Jacob's 
ladders, and radiant mountains in the dear o]^ fire ; but one might as 
well seek inspiration in the lid of a tin kettle — we shall be told that 
James Watt found it there — as in the coldly-warm, inclemently- 
heating stove of the parlors and nurseries of to-day. Truly has the 
eccentric young Irish lecturer told us that there is nothing aesthetic 
in such severe domestic comforts as the stove. 



HOME?, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 35 

But the old Fire was Home itself in essence and in miniature. We 
must not now dilate upon its cheerful glow, its kindly warmth, its 
visions of the ideal future that was not to be, lest our readers fall 
asleep, or into it. When we think of it we can understand how men 
of old " fought for their altars and their fires," especially the firesides 
of home. The picture of the circle round that fireside never grows 
dim or fades. 

" Dark shadows of approaching ill 

Fall thick upon life's forward track ; 

But on the past they stream not back, 

What once was bright remains so still." 

And the centre of all that once was bright was the home fireside. 
What stories were told by its red glow and flickering flame ! What 
books and magazines were read aloud beside it ! How much sweet 
talk of absent ones ! The wind that shrieked amid the leafless trees, 
or round the corners of the street, made us draw closer to it. Then 
the heroic story, the pathetic poem, the narrative of hairbreadth 
'scapes, the ghost story or tale of highway robbery, would hold us 
spellbotind. But neither winds nor waves, nor ghosts nor robbers 
scared us till we went to bed, for we felt safe from physical and 
spiritual harm so long as we could see the live coals burning on the 
altar-hearth of Home. 



HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 

" In many a village window burn 
The evening lamps ; 
They shine amid the dews and damps, 
Those lights of home ! 

•• Afar the wanderer sees them glow, 
Now night is near ; 

They gild his path with radiance clear. 
Sweet lights of home. 

" Ye lode-stars that forever draw 
The weary heart, 

In stranger lands or crowded mart; 
O ! lights of home. 

" When my brief day of life is o'er, 
Then may I see. 

Shine from the heavenly house for me 
Dear lights of home." 



JOME writer has said that the best security for civiliza- 
tion is the home, and that upon its perpetuity rests the 
future of the world. Certain it is that without home- 
life humanity would be lost to all the nobler condi- 
tions of existence, and be incapacitated from elevating 
itself The foundation of existence is home, and 
about its walls are entwined all the sweet memories of earth. Its 
inner temple, real or ideal, is the shrine at which all enlightened man- 
kind worships, and its altar is the Mecca of the heart, the Abdul-el- 
Kader of the soul. Poets have written of it — minstrels have made it 
the subject of song, and to all the world it has been an inspiring 
theme and a bright anticipation. 

To the masses it exists as yet ideally only. The average man and 
woman know nothing of its beauty, its rest, or its blessings. It lives

HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 37 

in tradition, is known to their hearts in the form of aspiration and 
desire, but is a reality only to the few. " The place where angels 
dwell — that is home," reads the old German legend, and the real 
interpretation of the word is not far different. 

It takes but little to make a home. It requires little to beautify it, 
but that little lacking, home can exist only in aspiration and in 
imagination. 

Harmony among those composing the family-circle, and a degree 
of worldly comfort secured, home may indeed be a reality, and to 
assist those who are trying to rear one, and to aid the seekers after 
refinement, beauty and economy in it, these hints are offered ! 

To make home-life beautiful, to give to it a charm which it ought 
to possess, to turn the hearts of the young to it with renewed affec- 
tion — can any task be more inspiring or deserving of success ? 

And as the most ideal thing on earth has as its foundation a most 
practicable fact, the real way to make a home is to build first in that 
portion upon which is to depend so much of the weal or woe of the 
house. Young beginners in home-making pay much attention to 
outward surroundings if their means will admit, and if they will not, 
their minds are more set upon the arrangement and finishing of the 
parlor than the other rooms of the home, and they are more apt to 
indulge in extravagance there than elsewhere. The basis upon which 
all homes should be founded is good living, and no matter how strait- 
ened the circumstances, how little there is to be spent, this can always 
be secured if housekeepers will begin at the beginning — that is, in the 
kitchen. That they do not thus begin is the reason why there is so 
little real home-comfort in houses; so little restfulness and true 
pleasure found in what ought to be genuine homes. 

The getting of a house does not guarantee the possession of a 
home ; it may and it may not. But the presence in the house of a 
good housekeeper does, for where the physical welfare of a family is 
looked after, the mental and spiritual comfort is almost sure to 
follow. A cheerful kitchen, for the children's sake, in the first 
place — for they love the kitchen naturally — should be the earliest 



38 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

possession, and not many times can it be secured with the insufficient 
help American housewives have to depend upon generally. 

A way to have a good cook is to be one, and the way to make • 
home happy is to have a well-supplied table. A humiliating admis- 
sion this to some, perhaps, but the truth is invincible, and sooner or 
later this one asserts itself. 

Three well-served meals each day will, under ordinary circum- 
stances, secure the home-happiness of almost any reaso able house- 
hold, and it cej-tainly does establish the comfort of all. 

The dining-room is the tell-tale apartment of the house ; whatever 
it is, so is the parlor, the up-stairs rooms or the kitchen. Cracked 
dishes, soiled covers, dingy carpets — these bespeak one kind of 
housekeeper, as neat napkins, clean chairs, and tidy ornaments 
another. The dining-room ought to be the pleasantest place in the 
house ; it is the meeting-room where the family are expected to be 
always present at stated times, and where the events of the day are 
talked over while the pleasant business of eating is being discussed. 

Dingy walls ought not to be tolerated in a dining-room ; they are 
an eyesore anywhere, but in this place they are entirely out of place. 
Tinted walls are preferable to papered ones ; but they cost more, and 
are not always to be commanded. If paper is selected, let it be suited 
to the size and general appearance of the room. 

If the room is low and long, the walls should not be papered at 
all. Plain white ones increase the apparent size of the apartment, 
and lighten it, while any colored or figured covering detracts from the 
desired effect. If the walls have been papered before, and must be 
covered in the same way again, choose a pale tint of some preferred 
color, and finish with a border of a brilliant and darker shade. Solid 
colors are the most suitable for a dining-room, for the reason that the 
eye does not weary of them as it does of figures, and because of the 
advantage in hanging pictures. With a bright background, pictures 
of almost any kind are improved in appearance, and the general 
effect, even with fine wall ornaments, is heightened. 

Figured designs are not adapted for the dining-room, and such 



HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 39 

paper always detracts from, rather than adds to, its appearance. 
Striped paper is preferable to figured, be the latter never so delicate, 
and panel paper is more suited^ to such rooms than either. For those 
who prefer the darker patterns in paper, and the Eastlake in style, 
there are numberless rich and beautiful patterns. But for dining- 
rooms, the best authorities favor the tinted walls. The furniture of 
a dining-room should be uniform. If of oak, then it should be more 
massive than walnut requires to be, and it should be more orna- 
mental. Walnut demands a better finish and more simplicity in 
design than oak, while the latter calls for more or less additional up- 
holstery. Chairs of oak are not really desirable unless the seats are 
cushioned, while walnut, with cane-seats, are pleasant enough for any 
demand. The buffet should be a match for the chairs and tables, and 
an extra table should always be provided to stand in a corner for the 
reception of newspapers ; otherwise the paper is put down beside the 
chair of the person reading, or it is laid upon another, and in either 
case is in the way. A bronze ornament for the mantel, and a couple, 
not necessarily a pair, of vases, will be sufificient in the way of small 
articles of a strictly ornamental kind. The mirror, if there is room 
for it, should be put in the dining-room. If not, then it should go to 
the sitting-room up-stairs, or the bedrooms. The parlor is not the 
place for mirrors, and the better taste of the American people will 
eventually banish them from its domain. 

Small articles are not suitable for the dining-room, where there is 
constant moving about and likelihood of their being broken by care- 
less servants. Pictures are acceptable, and the number should be 
according to the size of the apartment. Do not hang one above an- 
other in a dining-room ; it is almost impossible to keep them dusted 
where there are many. Fasten them with the silver or gold wire now 
so generally in use ; there is no comparison between it and the old 
worsted colored cord of other days which was always in danger of 
being moth-eaten, and which frayed out so soon. If selecting pic- 
tures for the dining-room, fine engravings will be far more suitable 
than ordinary paintings, and a water-colored fruit piece will give 
sufficient variety if color is wanted. 



40 The HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

Let the frames be plain and the pictures fine. Then for the window 
ornamentation, let there be only plain white shades, and have the 
recess filled, if desired, with a wire stand for a vine or a plant. The 
room, however, should be large if this is added. 

A clock should not be in the room, for Americans do not require 
to be reminded of time at the table — they spend less at it than any 
other civilized people, and there should be present on the table or 
buffet the daily papers to glance over if the desire is felt. The room 
ought to be sacred to its special uses, and those uses ought to be 
eating and talking and reading. It depends upon the size of the 
family as to whether there will be the latter, for young people and 
little children put it quite out of the question. On the corner of the 
buffet should be the ice-cooler and glasses, if it be summer ; or the 
china or glass pitcher if the weather be cold. A silver pitcher is too 
suggestive of cold drink to be as agreeable as a glass one in winter, 
and water is sufficiently cold in the latter, for the ice does not melt 
so speedily. 

A buffet is always a needed piece of furniture in a dining-room, 
and it should be suitably furnished. The glasses usually stand upon 
it, and also the tea-set of silver or china, as the case may be. Pretty 
articles of glass, such as the celery-stand, the fruit-dish and the cake- 
stand of silver (the latter term is applied for courtesy's sake, plated- 
ware being used as a rule) may be set upon it, and the pretty treasure 
of faience or majolica ware has its place in the collection. The plate 
upon the buffet should be well polished, for its condition is a certain 
indication of a well-managed or an ill-managed household. 

In regard to silver generally, it should be remembered that it is 
impossible to make greasy silver take a polish, and that, as spoons 
and forks in daily use are continually in contact with grease, they 
must require careful washing to remove it. 

The lack of a general reception-room in a home is always greatly 
felt by the growing members of the family as well as by their elders. 
Children like some place to have their friends, as well a retreat 
when the parlors are occupied, and the inclination for social compan- 



H0M£-MAK.ING AND ttOME-MANAC5EMENT. 4 1 

ionship is stronger than sleep or a walk, and they ought to have it. A 
sitting-room should have solid attractions in the form of easy-chairs, 
sofa-lounges and ornaments. All the knick-knacks ought to be 
gathered there, and the room made as pretty as variety and good 
taste can make it. The latest effort of the children's crayon-drawings 
should be at hand, and wax-flowers and dried leaves made by the 
young folk should be kept there. Books and pictures, work-basket 
and newspapers — all these, and more beside ; a stand for plants and a 
bird, or, better still, a music-box. 

If the house is not provided with a library, there should be a 
writing-desk or a table, with all the materials for writing, and any 
articles of statuary or vertu should find their way to this cosy nook. 
The clock should be here, and also the brackets and wall-pockets 
that look so out of taste in a parlor and are yet too pretty to consign 
to the up-stairs bed-rooms. 

A wicker rocking-chair, a Shaker sewing-chair and upholstered 
easy-chairs are delightful acquisitions to this gathering-place of the 
family ; and, if there is a spare mirror about the house, it will be in 
keeping with the variety of things in the sitting-room. The family 
Bible should be present, the photograph albums, and all the other 
albums that usually cumber the small tables in the parlor. A drop- 
light and stand, with shade, should be there, to do duty in the even- 
ing, and whatever else that is desired can be put in this brightest and 
best of all the rooms of the house. Here should hang the children's 
photographs, the family pictures, unless the latter are costly por- 
traits, and somewhere in the room should be a calendar. 

As may be judged, the notion entertained of a general sitting-roorn 
is that the things which ought not to be in other rooms ought to be 
here, and the many family valuables in the shape of Bibles, portraits, 
albums and the like, which are usually to be seen in parlors, should 
be transferred to a room more especially devoted to home-use. If 
such a room was saved out of the house, it would repay the depri- 
vation suffered for it, and there would always be a parlor for the 
family. 



42 THE HE-ARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

The reason so many children are ill-behaved in the presence of 
visitors is because they are unused to their own parlors, and they are 
naturally anxious to see and handle whatever is to be seen and 
handled when the opportunity offers. The advantage, too, of having 
a sitting-room is that, unless it is desired, formal guests need not have 
before their eyes so much that exhibits the inner side of the home life. 
Sometimes it is not pleasant they should. Not always, perhaps, 
do visitors suffer their curiosity to betray them into an examination 
of their hostess' belongings; but one lady whose mistrust of her 
guests always led her to keep the servant standing in the room while 
she was preparing to come down, might have been paralleled many 
times over. 

Drawing-rooms proper should be fine and severely plain, and 
handsome parlors are impaired rather than improved by the addition 
of useless ornaments. 

For sitting-rooms, there should be nothing too good for daily 
usage. The carpet should be of any quality deemed most suitable ; 
but the figures, whether it be of Brussels or three-ply, should be 
small and subdued in color. Look well to the selection of the 
carpet, for upon its beauty and worth depends much of the enjoyment 
of the room. Have no uniformity in the arrangement of furniture, 
and still less in its pattern. Choose useful things and pleas- 
ing ones, but sets of furniture should be avoided. It is almost tor- 
ture to see rows of chairs and sofas to match in the parlor ; in this 
room of utility and comfort let there be genuine variety — a variety 
born of the individuality of tastes in the house and not of a careful 
selection of oddities. A little cabinet of shells, or collections of any- 
thing that -some member of the family may delight in arranging, is a 
pretty treasure in a home, and so also are small collections of books 
kept separate and apart, and representing the peculiar bent of mind 
of some home-member. 

Persons interested in having acquaintance with the many trivial 
things a knowledge of which will add to the beautifying of home will 
find the following directions of service. After all, it is the little things 



HOME-MAKINCT AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 43 

of home-life that are to be thoroughly well performed, If domestic 
duties are to be elevated or made pleasant, and the safest and best 
way to gather them is to take them in fragments, and thus little by 
little master the details of what separately are very simple and easy 
to master. 

Home soon owns home-keepers, unless they are diligent in sim- 
plifying and mastering the detail duties required of them. Multi- 
tudinous cares sap the early bloom and health of women, and to 
none more than housekeeping is to be attributed the over-taxing 
of which they complain. They make many of their cares themselves, 
but, all the same, they are cares, and they deplete the strength of 
the body and the will-power, as much as though they were sent by 
heaven and designed for some good. 

In the matter of carpets, for instance, the home is often adorned at 
the expense of comfort, convenience, and health, and what ought to 
be a pleasure is, in fact, a tax and a continual source of anxiety. To 
parlor carpets are indirectly due much of the fretfulness, peevishness 
and discontent exhibited in the family. Strong charges these, but 
true and worthy of acceptance, when it is remembered how essential 
the parlor is to the enjoyment of the old and the young in the home. 
" Too good to be used " is usually the imaginary label affixed to the 
floor-covering in the best room, and only in the most careful way it 
is used, and then it is most frequently for the benefit of strangers. 
The colors are too bright, the quality too good, the cost too much for 
ordinary use, and its preservation is made one of the first duties of all 
in the home. From the hour that it is bought, it becomes master of 
the home, and against its tyranny children not only rebel at the time, 
but carry in memory all through life, revengeful thoughts of " that 
parlor carpet." 

Some people cease to be free the moment they buy carpets or 
furniture. From that hour their independence is gone, and instead 
of their possessing them, they own their owners. The Shakers, wise 
people, refuse to be under the dominion of upholstery, and, on 
the ground of cleanliness, decline to tolerate carpets in the form 



44 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

others use them. They will not be the slaves of the inanimate things 
in their houses, and they marvel at the abject servitude of the world's 
people in this regard. They marvel, too, at the untidiness common 
in homes, and at the perfect acquiescence of the majority of women, 
in the semi-clean state in which their houses are kept. They go to 
an extreme, perhaps, but if they do, their reward is more physical 
comfort than even the wealthy can possess themselves of 

They will not hang pictures on their walls because dust accumu- 
lates too readily, and the first principle of their religion is cleanliness. 
With them, this cardinal virtue is really next to godliness. 

Pictures put on the walls for the pleasure of beholders, ought to be 
kept scrupulously clean, and if they cannot be, the bare walls are 
preferable. As with pictures, so with carpets ; and since the latter 
are so hard to keep clean, the quality ought to be carefully con- 
sidered in buying them. 

Carpets were first used in little squares, and the people of the East, 
who had no chairs, invented them to sit upon. They were made of 
plaited rushes, and when used a certain length of time, were thrown 
aside. Hence it would seem that their inventors originally intended 
them only for temporary use, and that as they could not be kept clean, 
or washed when they were soiled, they were discarded; two simple 
rules which should remind moderns that, if they are more cunning in 
handicraft than were their ancestors, they are not more neat. 

If our floors were what they should be, we would not be confined 
to carpets so exclusively as we are. Women, who ought really to 
have the most to say about house-building, have the least, and floors 
and closets, the two most important feature? in houses, do not receive 
the consideration that is their due, for men do not realize the defects 
in these things always, and builders do not trouble to give better 
work than is required. The sight of a beautifully even and smooth 
floor, accurately laid and perfectly finished, is one worth seeing, but 
it is rare to eyes accustomed to even the finest of houses. We make 
much of our looms and our manufactures ; and show theii provluc- 
tions in all portions of the house, but the oak and the ce<\^ she 



HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 45 

hickory and the walnut woods that are to be had in such profusion in 
this country, are not generally utilized in our flooring, and not 
dreamed of as being more desirable than woollen carpets. 

If we cannot have Eastern floors of rare woods, we can have 
smooth ones, fit to put carpets over, and we ought to demand that 
they shall be a protection for them, rather than what they are — one 
of the most destructive elements against which they contend but a 
short time before they wear out. 

In buying carpets, choose for every room in the house, small pat- 
terns — Persian designs, or something as admirable in American styles. 
Get oak color, and with a blue border, for one room, and a serviceable 
shade of brown, with a crimson border about it, for another; or, 
buy a mixed pattern and the half-yard deep borders made specially 
for it. 

Velvet used to be preferred to all other kinds of carpets, but the 
popular voice is in favor of English body Brussels, or some of the 
other varieties of lighter carpets. Neutral tints last longest, and 
patterns should be small. The old-time flower-beds that were once 
laid out on carpets, and composed of blossoms of every kind, are 
relegated to the garret or the auction-room. The simpler styles are 
growing in favor, and those who know of the beauty of quiet colors, 
and the restfulness that a tasty carpet can give, select such carpets 
for their homes. Cheap carpets are costly, since they have to be 
renewed so often, and are, when at their best, only dust catchers ! A 
good three-ply Kidderminster or an English Brussels will give most 
satisfaction for a dining-room, sleeping apartment or room. 

Carpet designs are handsomer now than ever before, and there is 
no need for a homely pattern to find its way into any home. Care 
in their preservation will guarantee a long service, and by care is 
meant intelligence in cleaning and dusting them, and in the manner 
in which they are laid. No carpet ought to cover the entire floor. 
An inch, if not more, of space should be left all round the room, so 
that the corners can be kept clean, and the carpet easily taken up. 
They should be carefully fastened down with tacks that have suffi- 



46 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

cient body to hold and not tear the fabric, and the stretching process, 
save in a moderate degree, should not be indulged in because it ruins 
a carpet. Brown paper or newspapers are better protectors against the 
floor under carpets than the generality of paddings sold for that pur- 
pose ; and no carpet ought to remain on the floor long enough to 
wear these out. Dust in a carpet is likely to do more harm than to 
keep a duster in use ; weak lungs have no greater enemies. 

To sweep a carpet properly requires judgment, and, if there is 
much dust to be taken out of it, tea-leaves or bran or salt should be 
slightly dampened and scattered over it. Afterward, the carpet 
should be wiped off with a clean silk or cotton du.st-cloth. The 
sweeping should never be done against the grain — and the short, fierce 
strokes of an inexperienced sweeper only injure and do not clean a 
carpet. A long movement of the arm with the broom, holding the 
broom down to the floor, when the length is a long reach, will 
remove the dust and yet not throw it in the air, thus making double 
work. A broom used on a- carpet should never be taken to sweep any 
other kind of floor. When not in use, they should be hung upon a 
nail by a string put through the handle for the purpose. Servants 
rarely take the interest in carpets that the mistress does ; and since 
it is poor economy to hire a servant to take the exercise which she 
requires, housekeepers, as far as possible, should do their own sweep- 
ing. This is a radical doctrine, but the exercise is excellent, and it is 
the kind that the majority of women sadly need. 

To so adorn a window that it shall be an improvement to a 
room, and a pleasing feature of the exterior view of the house, is an 
achievement all too rarely accomplished. In the majority of homes 
a white shade is considered sufficient finish for the up-stairs windows, 
and the surplus adornments are reserved for the parlor, and when 
this is accomplished the windows are said to be decorated. Lace 
curtains are the chosen drapery for windows, and these are now 
manufactured in such varied qualities that the cottage of the hum- 
blest mechanic can have its pretty muslin or Nottingham curtains, 
though the latter, unless fine, are not desirable, even in cottages. 



HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 47 

Neither, again, are lambrequins, the homeliest of all window 
ornaments that have been devised. They do not serve the pur- 
poses of a curtain, nor add to the warmth or shading of the room, 
and they do not give the effect of drapery, since they are at the 
top of the window and look for all the world as though necessity 
had compelled the rejection of their nether extremities — short 
where they should be long, plain where they should be gathered 
in folds. Lambrequins are not decorative, and, save in bed-rooms, 
where they can be made of some light, bright-colored material, and 
be a match for other portions of the furniture, they are not desirable. 
Far prettier than they are the unbleached muslin curtains, trimmed 
with bands of colored silesia, and hung on rods with pretty walnut 
or brass rings. For bed-rooms these latter curtains are admirable, 
serving the purpose for which a curtain is intended, and adding to 
the general attractions of an apartment. 

Where the rooms are all to be furnished differently, these curtains 
are extremely adaptable, the bordering not showing on the under side, 
and having from the street the same general appearance. This fact 
should be borne in mind in furnishing windows, for where curtains 
vary much the external effect is not pleasing. Few things set off a 
house more than careful attention to the cleanliness and decoration 
of its windows, and the true secret of success in both these desirable 
ends is found in simple furnishing. A window which is too heavily 
draped is not likely to be kept thoroughly neat, and a room darkened 
by a surplus of drapery is unhealthy. Windows should be made 
beautiful by carefully considering the uses which they are to serve, 
and this is the only way to make and keep them attractive. If they , 
are merely to be used for the ordinary purposes of a reception-room or 
parlor, they may be more draped than when they are to serve as a 
place of entertainment and a place of observation for the occupant 
of a room. In order to make them as acceptable for the latter pur- 
pose, all hindrances in the way of curtains should be ignored, and a 
simple shade should be used, or curtains of a light kind, that can be 
easily removed. 



48 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

As a rule, we do not err in over-decoration ; the fault is the other 
way ; and windows are the barest portions of the room many times 
where they ought to be the most adorned. Flowers, more than 
anything else, add to the beauty of windows, and nothing is easier 
of possession than a few vines or growing plants. 

Hanging-baskets decorate, but these are seen only from within, 
and the heat from the gas soon destroys the beauty of flowers kept 
in the room. Window-gardens proper are far more preferable, and 
these can be made without half the cost of lace curtains, and will 
give double the amount of pleasure. 

The objection to them — that they require to be attended to — will 
not hold good when it is remembered how much time is spent in 
keeping draperies clean and free from dust. But the genuine love 
which so many persons feel for flowers will prevent them from looking 
upon their careful nurture as a trouble, and, for those who will tend 
them, their beauty is an ever-abundant recompense. 

Ferneries are often successfully planted in windows with a southern 
exposure, and, if there is a suitable window of the ordinary kind, this 
is easily accomplished. The one requisite for ferns is shade, and 
hence they are not really so handsome for bay-windows as are 
blossoming plants. They are better as square-window decorations, 
and when they are properly arranged the effect is charming. 

A pretty window conservatory can be made at a comparatively 
inexpensive cost by having a double sash united to the window casing 
with glass sides. This sash is best made in one piece, and the 
proper ventilation can be secured through a movable pane. 

If the conservatory is to be put in a room where there are three 
windows, the centre one will generally serve the purpose. The 
frame can be either square or oval, and the glass should be of the 
clearest quality, and as thick as possible. 

The top may be of wood or glass, the eaves of the house pro- 
tecting it sufficiently in either case. If the space is narrow, only 
vines, such as the Madeira or cypress, should be planted in the 
enclosure, and these should be placed in a box made to fit perfectly. 



HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 49 

It is best to consult a florist in the arrangement and selection of 
plants for such conservatories, and only such flowers should be 
chosen as will be most handy. 

Sometimes the outside sash is made to serve the one purpose, and 
the inside one is removed. This is a prettier mode of arranging the 
window, and the effect within is far better. A competent carpenter 
can arrange these conservatoi-ies, and for winter gardening they are 
thoroughly satisfactory and practical. 

For summer, the outside shutters necessitate the removal of flowers 
from the window ; but where an awning is used in place of shutters, 
low stands can be arranged in the windows. The handsomest win- 
dows seen in the cities are those which have the awnings and the 
flowers, and one thus arranged cannot be improved upon. Brackets 
on the sides of windows, holding plants, add greatly to the beauty of 
a home. 

All windows should have an upper and lower pane of glass that 
can be turned on a pivot, in order to ventilate the room ; and those 
who have ever enjoyed the advantages of an arrangement of this 
kind would scarcely try to put up with the old and disagreeable 
mode of opening the entire window every time a supply of fresh air 
was desired. The glass is framed in half the woodwork of the 
ordinary frame, and it either turns on a pivot or is hung on hinges. 
Either way answers the purpose, which is to give ventilation in winter 
without opening the entire window, and exposing occupants to strong 
draughts of air. 

An exquisite transparency for windows may be made by arranging 
pressed ferns, grasses, and autumn leaves on a pane of window glass, 
laying another pane of the same size over it, and binding the edge 
with ribbon, leaving the group imprisoned between. Use gum 
tragacanth in putting on the binding. It is well to secure a narrow 
strip of paper under the ribbon.. The binding should be gummed all 
around the edge of the first pane, and dried before the leaves, ferns, 
etc., are arranged ; then it can be neatly folded over the second pane 
without difficulty. To form the loop for hanging the transparency, 



50 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

paste a binding of galloon along the edges, leaving a two-inch loop _ 
free in the centre, afterwards to be pulled through a little slip in the 
final binding. These transparencies may be either hung before a 
window, or, if preferred, secured against a pane in the sash. 

Windows, to be well cleaned, should be washed with clear water 
and whiting, and the latter should be allowed to dry thoroughly 
before it is rubbed off A beautiful polish is thus secured for the 
glass, and windows so washed retain their lustre longer than do those 
cleaned with mops and soapsuds. Very little water is required to ' 
polish a window, if it is properly done, but care and time is required. 

Window-screens of wire, fastened in the lower sash or frames, is 
an excellent protection against flies and dust, and are only objection- 
able on the score of appearances in the opinion of some persons. 

Too many persons are apt to think, when a set of furniture and a 
new carpet are put into the best room, that they have a parlor. In 
one sense they have, in another they have not. Parlors, like all other 
rooms, to be really what they ought to be, should be individual, and 
the presence there of pretty articles indicative of the taste of the 
owner is absolutely essential to make them so. The true home-lover 
is one who very gradually and cautiously collects treasures for it. 

No greater error can be made than to hurry this pleasantest of 
all pastimes, and it should be the wisdom of all house-furnishers to 
go about it with the utmost care. Pictures and rare ornaments can 
only be added slowly, unless there is wealth, and the wealthy have 
none of the sweeter pleasures that come from the careful handling 
of small amounts which are required to do duty in such a variety of 
ways. Not the costly things are always the most desirable ; but the 
available and the useful ones are, for the most part, costly, and the 
treasure-seeker who knows how to combine all these requisites in 
her purchases is fortunate. But so many women err in choosing 
hastily, and being biased in their judgment by the suggestions of 
those with whom they are dealing, that hints as to what is advisable 
for the average purse may aid the new beginner in the perilous 
undertaking of a first furnishing. 



HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 5 I 

In the matter of window drapery do not mistake in the selection 
of cheap, showy lace. Buy muslin curtains rather than the large- 
patterned Nottingham and other poor material. And, if the best 
guipure or Flanders lace cannot be bought to trim them, leave them 
plain, or finish them with the prettily-fluted ruffles that give such a 
pretty effect. Sometimes a puffing is added in connection with the 
ruffle, and in this is not unfrequently run a pretty blue or pink cam- 
bric ribbon, cut the right width and carefully inserted. The curtains 
are looped back with ribbon to match the color used in the puffings, 
and then they give a refined as well as a bright and fresh effect to 
a parlor or sitting-room. Under these curtains should always be 
white or colored shades, and the former should be fastened on light 
wood, or gilt bars and rings, as will best suit the furniture of the 
room. 

If the mantel is covered, the table should be, particularly where 
the latter is of marble, for marble in parlor furniture is well nigh 
abandoned, and if uniformity is desirable, the covers in each instance 
should match the curtains or contrast well with them. 

In the matter of mantel ornaments the fault is usually found in 
overcrowding. There is too much on the mantel and above it to be 
tasteful, and the articles have the appearance of being on display 
themselves, rather than adding to the beauty of the room in which 
they are placed. The folly of overcrowding need not be enlarged 
upon ; it is the getting of harmonious articles that concerns us most 
now, and if the advice about buying leisurely is followed, this mis- 
take will not be made. 

In regard to having books in a parlor, even where there is but one 
company-room, much diversity of opinion is expressed. The effort 
of every household ought to be to gather books enough for a book- 
case of some kind, even if it consists of only a few pine shelves, and 
'these ought always to be in the family or sitting-room, where they 
can be in frequent use, and not be borrowed indiscriminately. Visit- 
ors not unfrequently borrow a book because they see it, and books 
should not fall into such hands. 



52 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

As nearly every lady of the house desires to do as much in the 
way of furnishing herself as is possible, the following directions for 
making various articles are given, some of which are designed for 
parlor ornamentation, while others are of a more general character 
and suitable as hints to those desiring to improve articles already 
supplied. 

A pretty folding screen of home manufacture is made with a 
foundation of black glazed paper, and it must come up to the edge 
of the screen, so as to leave no place uncovered. The pictures 
should be carefully cut out and arranged upon the surface, only they 
should be pinned on before being fixed, that the effect may be seen. 
Some people arrange the pictures one over the other, so as almost 
to hide the foundation ; but pictures look far better placed sepa- 
rately, only they must be carefully selected. It is best to have a 
large one in the centre of the panel, and smaller ones arranged 
round it, and colored pictures should always be preferred to the 
prints. They should be fixed to the foundation with starch, and 
care must be taken in making it that no lumps are left in it, or they 
will get under the pictures and remain there. There is nothing so 
suitable for the bordering of a screen as stamped leather. This 
should be about an inch and a half in width, and scalloped round the 
edge, with a brass headed nail placed in each scallop. Maroon or 
green leather are the colors that look best with the pictures, and, of 
course, this bordering must not be put on the screen until it has 
been varnished and has become quite dry. 

Old furniture re-covered in cretonne often makes the most com- 
fortable and desirable of articles. Some housekeepers can, with the 
aid of a good cutter, upholster their own furniture; but it is more 
economical to have the work done by an artist. The best twilled 
cretonne is the cheapest for sets of furniture, but where only one or 
two articles are to be covered, the smooth and less costly kind can 
be made to answer admirably. Irish tapestry is preferred by many 
to cretonne, and the difference in cost is so little that the choice can 
be left to one's taste. 



HOME-MAKING AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 53 

Exquisite colors are offered in cretonnes, and there are many 
pretty and dainty ways of using it to advantage, in re-covering sofa- 
pillows, trimming mantels and wall brackets, and in applique work 
for tidies. 

A border for a mantel-piece always repays one, and, when made 
of macreme lace, is very showy. It should be made up over either 
cloth or velvet, to suit the taste of the maker, and the Vandykes of 
the velvet should be about an inch, or a little deeper, beyond the 
lace. These pretty articles of adornment are made up of a variety 
of materials, most frequently in cloth, but for a parlor-mantel, are 
most elegant composed of macreme lace and velvet or plain plush. 

The drawing-room fire-place should always be concealed in sum- 
mer, for it is rarely handsome or pleasing to look at, and one of the 
most successful ways for doing this is to arrange silk curtains 
of a color to accord with the prevailing shade of the furniture of the 
room. These curtains should be edged on each side with fringe or 
lace, and then looped up with ribbon bows. This is a great improve- 
ment over the ordinary paper screen or iron front, and if the interior 
is neatly papered it will be a feature of the room. 

Unbleached cotton and bunting are both much used for curtains. 
They are bordered with one broad, or two or three narrow rows of 
pink, blue or crimson silesia. For bed-rooms the silesia is more 
suitable than lace, but unless care is used the colors will fade, partic- 
ularly if the sunlight is admitted, as it ought to be in all rooms. 
Turkey-red silesia wears the best, but those desiring the pale rose- 
color or blue, which is a far handsomer trimming for spring or sum- 
mer curtains, can renew it without much trouble if it does fade. 
Rings and rods for these curtains can be made by any carpenter, of 
stained pine or of walnut. The latter are the handsomest if not the 
most economical. 

The time spent in making trash in the way of so-called fancy 
articles is immense, and the homes made unattractive with the 
varieties of tidies, mats, foot-rests, rugs, and other fancy work, are 
fer too numerous. The money taken up in such purchases is 



54 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

scarcely less in amount where the articles are purchased ready- 
made than where the materials are purchased and the work done at 
home. The work-basket is filled with crewels and sticks and 
crochet-pins, and there is a continual reminder of valuable hours spent 
in worse than idleness in many homes where there are young or 
middle-aged people. Old people knit, and sensible articles of cloth- 
ing are the result of their handiwork. Young people make anatomi- 
cal curiosities in the shape of animals and insects, and create 
arabesque designs in the most unnatural way imaginable. 

Where the fancy for trifles is not indulged in because of the ab- 
sorption of time in some other direction, the sewing-basket too fre- 
quently gives evidence of the fact that one form of fancy-work has 
taken the place of the other, and that the substitute is of no more 
real necessity than the first article. 

The work-basket can be, and is oftentimes, one of the most dispirit- 
ing objects in life to a woman of mistaken views regarding dress. It 
can be so filled with ruffles and flounces, and frills and tucks, that 
existence seems a long season of hems and gathers and plaits, and 
by the time the garments are completed the spirits are depressed, and 
the necessity for greater effort discourages the tired devotee. 

The price paid for finery by too many of the sex is dyspepsia. 
They sacrifice animation and good nature for elaborately made cloth- 
ing, and, if they knew it, they pay a yet greater cost, for, besides the 
loss of good health, there is the disquiet of heart, the irritability of 
mind and the general peevishness that accompanies all exhaustion. 

It does seem a pity that the work-basket should be an evil genius 
in a home, when it ought to be woman's best friend, and the best 
solace of many an hour of life. 

Work is inspiring where there is not too much of it, and sewing is 
a restful occupation if taken up and put down when the inspiration 
is upon one. It becomes a cross when the tyranny of fashion 
demands too much of nervous fingers, and when the hours spent at it 
are taken from nobler pursuits. Temperance in sewing is as much 
demanded as temperance in eating or drinking, and only the temper- 



hOMfi-MAKlKG AND HOME-MANAGEMENT. 5^ 

ate know how to enjoy the pleasant pastime. How many times sew- 
ing has rested and soothed the weary wife and mother as nothing 
else would, and what pleasure the fashioning of clothes has given 
when they were really useful and needful in the house ! 

Sometimes the variation of work rests us, for nothing is more 
tedious than a great number of articles all to be worked upon 
till finished. Taking sewing leisurely, is the way to enjoy it, and 
there is really a world of satisfaction and rest to be found in the 
work-basket if it is called into requisition in the right spirit. 

It is a real comfort to a prudent-minded person to be able to 
fashion anything, and the pleasure of seeing an article grow into form 
and shape is certainly great, if necessity is not so stern as to demand 
toil of us. The satisfaction is not so much in making the thing to be 
made, as in getting pleasure out of the making. There is a keen en- 
joyment to be had out of sewing if it is not allowed to be too 
absorbing or engrossing, and if it does not become the master instead 
of the subject. To work to some purpose is to weave in with the 
warp and woof of each particle of surface gone over a pleasant 
memory, and thus associate surroundings and circumstances until for 
all time to come the heart shall remember just how the work was 
done, and where. How many such memories have we all ? How 
many associations dear as time are awakened by the sight of a dress 
or a handkerchief, or a neatly-made garment — worn and worthless, 
perhaps, but kept because of the tender recollections. It is thus that 
sewing should be done ; it is in this way that the work-basket should 
be utilized, and a solace it is to those who thus use it. The familiar 
work-basket should be a loved article of household furniture, and 
mother or sister should be associated with it, not as hurrying, driven, 
tired and overstrained sewers, but as enthusiasts, finding it a relief to 
sew, simply because by sewing social chat can be indulged in, and 
a time to think would be secured, if talking is not agreeable. 

Too much attention is given to it, hence the complaints made by 
many women that they are never free from its monotony. Too little 
time is given to varying the work, and lightening each day the labor to 



S6 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

be performed. We should try harder not to have so much sewing to 
do ; and, laying aside the nonsensical demands of the work-basket, do 
only that which is called for absolutely. The time has come for 
women to be ransomed from the needle, and to be made acquainted 
with the pleasure that sewing — a proper amount and performed under 
right circumstances — will give to them. It is now that slavery in 
this direction should end, and a better standard of work and workers 
be secured thereby. We have had the veneering style long enough. 
We need some Eastlake in the sewing-basket as much as we do in the 
furniture in the parlors, or the upholstery in the bed-rooms. To sim- 
plify sewing, to do it well, and to make each article so durable that 
it will last well and serve a good purpose, this is the true end of sew- 
ing. It has been a much abused trade long enough ; let us raise it to 
the dignity of a fine art by refusing to utilize or countenance any but 
the best and plainest kinds of sewing. No more tawdry decoration of 
ill-shaped and poorly sewed garments. We want art needlework, and 
we propose to so dignify our beloved companion the sewing-basket, 
that none but artists will be able to compete for the best prizes in 
this calling. 



THE BABY IN THE HOME. 



'' Where did you come from, baby, dear I 
Out of the everywhere into here. 

Where did you get the eyes so blue ? 
Out of the sky as I came through. 

Where did you get that little tear ? 
I found it waiting when I got here. 

What makes your forehead so smooth and high ? 
A soft hand stroked it as I went by. 

What makes your cheek like a warm, white rose? 
I saw something better than any one knows. 

Whence that three-cornered smile of bliss ? 
Three angels gave me at once a kiss. 

Where did you get this pretty ear ? 
God spoke, and it .came out to hear. 

Where did you get those arms and hands? 
Love made itself into hooks and bands. 

Feet, whence did you come, you darling things ? 
From the same box as the cherub's wings. 

How did they all come just to be you ? 
God thought of me and so I grew. 

But how did you come to us, my dear ? 
God thought about you, and so I am here.' 

SHE advent so anxiously expected has taken place. The 
doctor says that all is well, as he puts on his gloves 
and bids us keep the patient quiet, and give her milk 
and beef-tea at stated intervals, and a sense of unutter^ 
able thankfulness that his dear companion is safe fills 
a good husband's heart. For many months and weeks he has tried 
hard to banish the perils of child-birth from her mind and his own, but

58 THE HEARTHStONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

ever and anon an anxious cloud has darkened his vision, and he has 
perhaps brushed a tear from his dim eyes away as he has thought, 
" Poor wife ! if she were taken from me, what should I do ? " This is 
true marriage, in spite of little differences settled as soon as they begin, 
when the man or woman feels that without the wife or the husband the 
burdens of life would be unbearable, and that to lose that kindly 
face and sympathizing heart would be to lose all that makes life 
worth living. O, how glad is the poor man when he learns that all 
danger is over, and that his wife will not be taken from him as so 
many are, leaving a motherless child, or taking it with her to another 
home. Now the sunshine of happiness and hope illumines the face 
, that was lately downcast. Already he sees his boy cherishing 
his mother when she is old and he is dead. My boy, he thinks, will 
be a better man than his father. He will rise far higher ; he will 
have no such drawbacks and hindrances as I have had. I am not much 
of a scholar, but he will be great in all that books can teach, for 
now-a-days they say that science and learning may be had by any 
lad for the asking. How proud his mother will be of him ! I hope 
he will be like her in quiet power, and have her forgiving temper. I 
am a little hasty sometimes myself, and want things my own way. 
But my wife is always right, and has the best of it when we differ. 
Poor, dear girl ! she has been a better wife to me than I deserve, and 
all her thoughts and feelings are way ahead of mine. How happy this 
little man will make her ! I guess I shall have to do my own mend- 
ing for the future. I wonder if I shall get any dinner now, that the 
youngster will need all her care. Well, I must shift for myself and 
take " pot-luck," as the saying is. And so the father rambles on, 
and scratching' his agricultural pate, for no doubt he is a farmer, or he 
would not be thus discussing the first-fruits, and the crops and the 
tender blossom that has appeared suddenly in the little garden of 
home. Let us leave the good man to sleep on the floor, or break 
his neck between t\:-o stools, or sit up smoking his pipe and gazing 
at the stars that have looked down on such dohiestic scenes since 
light first broke from heaven upon the earth. How calmly they 




BABY'S WELCOME. 



THE BABY IN THE HOME. 59 

regard him, every quivering orb seeming to wink at him that his 
case is not uncommon, and that his baby will not be the last man. 

" Nothing in nature's aspect indicated 
That a great man was dead," 

sang Tennyson upon the death of the Duke of Wellington. Noth- 
ing in nature's aspect indicates that a new man is born on such 
occasions as the one I am describing. All things, except in-doors, con- 
tinue as they were. The birds have not an extra note, nor the flowers 
an extra perfume. Yet there is melody and fragrance in one poor 
woman's heart as she " remembers no more the anguish, for joy that 
a man is born into the world." 

The mother also has deep and silent thoughts, and the tear of 
thankfulness betokens that her meditation is sweet. 

" To-day the hallow'd air 
Is fragrant with a mother's first and fondest prayer." 

" O, what a treasure of sweet thought 
Is here ! what hope and joy and love 
All in one tender bosom brought ! ' ' 

She is glad if it is a boy, for I suppose all mothers prefer boys. 
But if it prove a girl she is well content, and so is the father, for if a 
boy excites more worldly ambition a girl is most prophetic of 
domestic tranquillity. 

For both father and mother, as they watch the opening growth of 
the little man or woman who has come from God to bless them, day 
by day and week by week, there lies in helpless trust an incarnate soul 
and a miniature of all biography, a figure and an embryo of all the 
mysteries of life. Through the mere accident of its parents meeting, 
loving and marrying in this jostling world, this angel of the home 
has come. Yet that accident, interpreted by such a blessing, was 
a special providence. Within that little casket is a priceless jewel. 
Those tiny hands may one day grasp the rod of empire. Those 



6o THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

tiny feet may traverse distant lands, and be shod with light and in- 
fluenc,e. That little head may have potentially the awful power of 
reason, the reflected light of memory, the keen dividing force of 
judgment, the happy blending power of wit. Love, and faith, and 
hope are beating imperceptibly in that unconscious heart. That 
speechless tongue may bear a message to the world. Its pedigree 
dates back into the ages past, its destiny into ages yet to come. 
Eternal memories are written on its brow, for 

" Not in entire forgetfulness, 
Nor yet in utter nakedness, 
But trailing clouds of glory do we come 
From God who is our Home." 

Beautifully as well as truly did the ancient seers and poets embody 
their previsions of ideal government and human regeneration in the 
person of some coming child. The names of Wonderful and Coun- 
sellor are his. " The government shall be upon his shoulders, and a 
little child shall lead them," is the strain alike of Virgil and Isaiah. 
The humble cottage has been the birthplace often of the world's 
heroes. The thatched roof has sheltered genius in its helpless 
infancy. Parents, you should cherish this baby in your home with 
reverence as well as natural affection, for you may be entertaining an 
angel unawares. Certainly he is a king's son, or she a king's 
daughter, " all glorious within," or why does the baby at once assume 
command, and employ so many hands, and feet, and hearts to do it 
service ? 

In a few weeks' time you will see the light of intelligence and ob- 
servation begin to concentrate in the wondering and wistful eyes. 
The little face will turn toward you, and greet you with a smile. 
The hands, so small and soft, with tapering fingers, and pink, trans- 
parent nails, will be thrown out to bid you take it in your arms and 
play with it. Soon, and by steps you cannot trace, the cry of need 
will become the speech of reason, and the longing mind, receiving 
impressions and comparing objects, will begin to question "why?" 
" How" is born some time after " why " in the child's reason. 



THE BABY IN THE HOME, 6 1 

But suppose your little one be not "a mute, inglorious Milton,'' 
" a Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood," a Mozart, a Shaks- 
peare, a Michael Angelo, or a Newton, but one of the many, one of 
the people, an ordinary citizen of the world in promise, it may be 
just as well for his happiness and yours. Precocious children are 
not always the most amiable, and genius oftentimes has to suffer and 
pay awful penalties. So that his brain works orderly, and his heart 
is " in the right place," you need have no regrets. Your baby will 
still be the dearest being in the world to you. You will learn from 
him more than you can teach him. He will be the angel of the 
covenant of home. He will draw out your noblest qualities, and 
engage your most unselfish devotion. He will be more to you than 
lands and houses, riches and fame, and make sunshine for you in 
life's wintry days. 

There is something very affecting and beautiful in the thought 
that parents live again in their offspring. So that man may be said 
never to die so long as his spirit is perpetuated in his children, who 
again transmit it onward in unbroken succession. As a physio- 
logical fact, the same distinctive qualities of mind and body, modified, 
of course, by time, climate, circumstances, and the like, are found in 
races, nationalities, and families. A curious instance of this occurred 
to a traveller, who was much struck by the resemblance of a young 
girl to a very. dear friend of his, belonging to another place, and bear- 
ing another name. Even the voice and manner constantly recalled 
his absent friend. The young girl subsequently proved to be his 
friend's second cousin, though the gentleman had not the remotest 
idea previously of his friend's name or person being even known to 
the girl's family. " What is bred in the bone will come out in the 
flesh," is a very old saying, and it is constantly verified in the reap- 
pearance of race and family characteristics in different generations 
and individuals. What a multitude of reflections are suggested by 
this fact ! Some of them are full of sweetness, light and hope ; others, 
alas ! are full of awful warning and sadness. When Thomas Starr 
King, the political orator and eloquent preacher, of San Fran- 



62 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Cisco, was on his death-bed, his last look was fixed upon the face of 
his little son, carried in his nurse's arms. " Beautiful boy ! beautiful 
boy ! " were the last words he spoke, and love for his dear child was 
the last throb of the dying father's heart. Some persons attach a 
significance akin to inspiration to a great spirit's parting sign on 
earth. If the last thought of earth should be the first in he^i'en, 
and memory and affection only rise upward to a higher sphere, then 
heaven's first gladness to this departing parent was love for his boy, 
care for his welfare, hope for his future. And if as some believe, 
science will yet find means of photographing from the retina of a 
dead person's eyes, the faces and objects that were last imaged upon 
it, then this father left the earth with the picture of his child im- 
pressed upon his physical, and with the spiritual picture upon his 
spiritual vision. There is no fraud or superstition in such a spirit- 
ualistic theory as this. The patterns of things in heaven may be 
woven from those of earth ; and if so, then it is indeed true that 
" the company in heaven and earth are one." Death no longer parts 
the souls that love each other or destroys the family circle. The 
little maiden's " We are seven," is true, although one enters at one 
door, while another passes out of sight through another. 

How cheering to the parent's heart is such a vision ! The thoughts, 
the affections, the aspirations, and enterprises of father or mother 
shall still live, and move, and have their being in the son or daughter, 
and so we do not die but live, since life is thus constantly renewed in 
those through whose veins our own life-blood courses. Charles R. 
Darwin and Herbert Spencer in their life-work did but carry out the 
work which their own fathers had begun, and left them as their intel- 
lectual heirs and representatives. But if there is a bright side to such a 
view, there is also a dark side. Human law teaches us the maxim that 
he who commits crime through another commits it himself, and the 
great Teacher of still higher law said to his disciples, " It has been said 
by them of old time, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth ; but I say 
unto you, forgive your enemies, and do good to them that hate you." 

If parents thus live on in their children and can impress their own 



THE BABY IN THE HOME. 63 

personal qualities upon them, how tremendous is the parental re- 
sponsibility for their future fcharacters and lives ! Some parents seem 
to think that it does not matter what their children see and hear, 
because they are only children. "A mere child," to use a common 
phrase, may see anger, quarrelling, and perhaps blows in the house- 
hold and not be affected by such sights or sounds. What monstrous 
folly ! As soon as a child sees he observes ; the gradually growing 
brain is conscious, and the power of thought begins when sight, hear- 
ing and observation begin. How soon a child learns to know its own 
name, and looks to see who speaks to it ! When you laugh, and 
smile at it and play with it, is it unconscious ? And it is just as con- 
scious when it sees your face assume an angry frown, and hears your 
voice raised in anger. I have seen a little child of three months old 
who would chirp and spread its tiny arms for joy at the voice of 
kindness, happiness and love, but whose little face would lengthen 
with a solemn wonder, and almost a sense of pain and wrong, if its 
parents only pretended to be angry with each other, or the nurse had 
slapped another in a feint of chastisement. Let us be sure that every 
act we do and every word we speak has a latent influence upon our 
children. When old Samuel Johnson was asked by the mother of a 
little girl three years of age how she should begin to educate her, 
the wise doctor of laws and of social philosophy answered, " Madam, 
you have consulted me two years too late." Education really begins 
as soon as the child is born into the world. When the eyes open, it 
is ours to take care that the first prospect they look upon is one of 
light and peace. When the ear first listens let heaven's best music — 
the true music of the home — fall upon it. 

We hear much talk about bright, and smart, and clever, and pre- 
cocious children. What is this precocity but receptivity to im- 
pressions, sensibility to influences? Would any child be " wiser than 
the ancients " without such contact ? Do they come into the world 
revealing things to us or do we reveal things to them ? It is the 
parent's hand that draws aside the curtain and shows its child the 
play upon the mimic stage of life. It is the parent's voice that 



64 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

teaches truth or error Httle by little, day by day, unconscious of the 
tremendous results of that teaching to the child. Some people think 
the infant baptism practised by the older Christian churches a sense- 
less form and great absurdity. But its real sense seems to me to be 
the witness it bears to this great truth, that as soon as life begins, 
influences and education begin also. 

Let us glance at the childhood of some typical precocious child. 
Hartley Coleridge is the first that occurs to my mind. This is what 
his brother Derwent tells us of him, and it illustrates the principles I 
have just stated. " By nature not less than by circumstances he was 
indeed the poet-child of a poet-father. ... I have heard my mother 
say that when he was first taken to London, being then a child in 
arms, and saw the lamps, he exclaimed, ' O ! now I know what the 
stars are — they are lamps that have been good upon earth, and have 
gone up into heaven.' " And in the diary of Henry Crabb Robinson 
is the following entry under date of August the 8th, 1 8 1 1 : "After- 
wards stepped to Charles Lamb's. Coleridge there, who related some 
curious anecdotes of his son Hartley, whom he represented to be a 
most remarkable child — a deep thinker even in his infancy. He 
tormented himself in his attempts to solve the problems that would 
equally torment the full-grown man, if the world, and its cares and 
pleasures did not distract his attention. Hartley, when about five 
years old, was asked a question about himself being called Hartley. 
' Which Hartley ? ' asked the boy. ' Why ! is there more than one 
Hartley?' 'Yes,' he replied; 'there's a deal of Hartleys.' 'How 
so ? ' ' There's Picture-Hartley (Hazlitt had painted a portrait of 
him), and Shadow-Hartley, and there's Echo-Hartley, and there's 
Catch-me-fast-Hartley ; ' at the same time seizing his own arm with 
the other hand very eagerly — an action which shows that his mind 
must have been drawn to reflect on what Kant calls the great and 
inexplicable mystery, viz. : that man should be both his own subject 
and object, and that these two should be one. At the same early 
age, continued Coleridge, Hartley used to be in an agony of thought, 
puzzling himself about the reality of existence, As when some one 



THE BABY IN THE HOME. 65 

said to him, ' It is not now, but it is to be.' ' But,' said he, ' if it is to be, 
it is.' Perhaps this confusion of thought lay not merely in the im- 
perfection of language. Hartley, when a child, had no pleasure in 
things ; they made no impression on him till they had undergone a 
process in his mind, and were become thoughts and feelings." 

Now this precocious child was exactly four years, four months and 
twenty days old when this incident occurred. Who can assign a 
period too early in that brief life for this wonderful power of reflection, 
comparison and introspection to have begun ? And there are plenty 
more of whom the world never hears, but of whom it is equally true 
that they are deep thinkers even in their infancy. Well might 
the parent of such a child address him as Samuel Taylor Coleridge 
did in those exquisite lines : 

" Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side, 
Whose gentle breathings heard in this deep calm, 
Fill up the interspersed vacancies 
And momentary pauses of the thought : 
My Babe, so beautiful ! it thrills my heart 
With tender gladness, thus to look on thee. 
And think that thou shall learn far other love, 
And in far other scenes ! For I was rear'd 
In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim, 
And sawr naught lovely but the sky and stars. 
But thou, my Babe, shalt wander like a breeze 
By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags 
Of ancient mountains, and beneath the clouds, 
Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores 
And mountain crags ; so shalt thou see and hear 
The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible 
Of that eternal language which thy God 
Utters, who from eternity doth teach 
Himself in all, and all things in himself. 
Great universal Teacher ! He shall mould 
Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask." 

In a similar strain, his father addresses him in the poem entitled 
" The Nightingale : " 
S 



66 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

" That strain again ! 
Full fain it would delay me ! My dear Babe, 
Who, capable of no articulate sound. 
Mars all things with his imitative lisp, 
How he would place his hand beside his ear; 
His little hand, the small forefinger up, 
And bid us listen ! And I deem it wise 
To make him Nature's Playmate. He knows well 
The evening star ; and once when he awoke 
In most distressful mood (some inward pain 
Had made up that strange thing, an infant's dream), 
I hurried with him to our orchard plot, 
And he beheld the moon, and, hush'd at once, 
Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently. 
While his fair eyes, that swam with undropt tears. 
Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam. Well, 
It is a Father's tale : but if that Heaven 
Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up 
Familiar with these songs, that with the night 
He may associate joy ! " 

A little later, when he was six years old, we find this wondrous boy 
appearing in one of Wordsworth's most exquisite poems. 

"TO H. c. 

"SIX YEARS OLD. 

" O Thou ! whose fancies from afar are brought ; 

Who of thy words dost make a mock apparel, 
And fittest to unutterable thought 

The breeze-like motion and the self-born catol^ 
Thou fairy voyager ! thou dost float 
In such clear water, that thy Boat 
May rather seem 

To brood on air than on an earthly stream ; 
Suspended in a stream as clear as sky, 
Where earth and heaven do make one imagery ; 

blessed Vision ! happy Child ! 
Thou art so exquisitely wild,

For what may be thy lot in future years.

I thought of times when Pain might be thy guest, 

Lord of thy house and hospitality; 
And Grief, uneasy lover ! never rest. 

But when she sat within the touch of thee. 
O too industrious folly, 
O vain and causeless melancholy. 
Nature will either end thee quite 
Or, lengthening out thy season of delight.

A young lamb's heart among the full-grown flocks. 
What hast thou to do with sorrow. 
Or the injuries of to-morrow ? 

Thou art a Dew-drop, which the morn brings forth. 
Ill fitted to sustain unkindly shocks. 
Or to be trailed along the sailing earth ; 
A gem that glitters while it lives, 
And no forewarning gives ; 
But, at the touch of wrong, without a strife 
Slips in a moment out of life." 

The bright and beautiful Baby, whose deep thoughts and eager 
questionings evoked so much anxiety for the future and tender care , 
for the present, fulfilled in after life the picture thus drawn of him by 
the kind poet's hand so nearly that the prophecy might almost seem 
inspired. But there are other fairy voyagers whose fragile boats 
seem rather to brood on air than on an earthly stream ; other Dew- 
drops as ill fitted as poor Hartley Coleridge proved to bear unkindly 
shocks. His character through a sohtary life blighted by morbid 
sensitiveness and an irresolute will, was that of " multitudes, multi- 
tudes, in the Valley of Decision." Whence was this strange combi- 
nation of noble impulses, sublime aspirations, profoundly philo- 
sophic musings and metaphysical insight, combined with a pitiable 
weakness, a despondent temper, a wish without the power to be true 
to his better self, derived ? Surely, in some degree, from the father 
who idolized him, who had for seventeen years been the slave of 
the opium habit, which had enfeebled the will and the reason and 
clouded the memory and the imagination of one of the greatest 
minds the world has ever known. Had the laudanum-drinking of 



68 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the father, nothing to do with the dram- 
drinking of Hartley Coleridge, the son ? No one can doubt that it 
had, who knows anything about the hereditary transmission of appe- 
tites as well as talents. There is not a selfish or luxurious habit, 
whether it be a deadly one like opium-eating or not, which a parent 
can indulge which is not liable to reappear in another form and taint 
the character, even if it does not poison the life and blight the career 
of his offspring. There is no sadder sight than this generous, tender- 
hearted and highly gifted youth presented when — within a year after 
gladdening his own, his father's and his brothers' hearts by winning 
a position in England's oldest university, which would have given him 
a distinction and a competence for life, by his own talents and learn- 
ing in fair competitive examination with others — he was expelled from 
it for drunkenness. The agonized father — consciousness of his own 
infirmity adding to his grief — went down and pleaded with an old 
man's tears for his poor son ; but the character of the college and 
that of the students was involved, and the authorities could not, if 
they wished, overlook a habit which was notorious and had stretched 
its victim helpless in the gutter. And this was the " fairy voyager " 
whose raft of life was to sail always in clear water, or seemed to do 
so in his infancy. Pain and grief were now and henceforth indeed 
his guests. The Dew-drop was indeed earth-soiled, and the gem was 
stript of its setting. 

From this and similar biographies, parents, and especially fathers, 
should learn the caution that they must take care of the example 
they set their children, and that a far truer saying than " Never too 
late to mend" is "Never too young to learn." Mental and moral 
not less than physical disease may be cured if taken in time. But 
the time is not when the habits are formed and have become a second 
nature ; when the character is set and hardened, and cannot be bent 
and inclined at another angle. Reader, if you are a father or a 
mother, and are looking with love and joy upon the face of your 
infant who as yet can neither speak nor choose his future lot, remem- 
ber as you love your own souls that upon you, and not on circum-

stances external to the Home, depends mainly the awful issue of what 
it shall be and what shall become of it. It is you, not what you call 
a hard, unfeeling world, that will make or mar your child. It is for 
you to determine whether its tongufe shall speak vanity, and its right 
hand be a right hand of falsehood. It depends upon you whether 
your sons shall be as " plants grown up in their youth," and your 
daughters become as " corner-stones, polished after the similitude of 
a palace." The white unwritten page of your child's life and charac- 
ter is open for you to write upon. The impressions made upon it by 
the parents are indelible. The first sights and sounds that are 
reflected upon a child's remembrance are ineffaceable. 

Nature will assist you in this work, but she will not do it for you. 
She gives the material for you to work upon. You might as well 
expect the grass and plants to grow without moisture as the soul to 
grow without culture. Nature provides the limbs, but exercise devel- 
ops them and gives them strength and symmetry. Yet many parents 
seem to think that their children will love the beautiful and do the 
good by mere instinct, and that the mere process of living will insure 
their living rightly and worthily. One might as well expect reading 
and writing to come by nature. But God says to the parent, as 
Pharaoh's daughter said to the nurse to whom she intrusted the 
infant who was to become the law-giver of a great race : " Take this 
child and nurse it for me, and I will pay thee thy wages," or I will 
reward thee. What reward can be greater than to see one's heaven- 
given babe awakening more and more to a perception of light and 
beauty, and loving "whatsoever things are lovely" and true and 
noble ? Do not be content with vegetation for your child ; teach it to 
live. How many parents, who neglect this duty through selfish 
indolence or ignorance, live to wish that their child had never been 
born ! — while those who " train up a child in the way that he should 
go " verify the proverb that " when he is old he will not depart from 
it." This is no miracle ; it is the course of nature and experience. 
Habits become laws ; good habits mean happiness and honor; evil 
habits mean misery and degradation. It depends upon home influ-

ences and parental training whether the helpless baby shall grow to ' 
be a king or a slave in mind and disposition. If your child inherits 
from you a hasty temper, you can cure that by exhibiting your own 
self-control and discipline of word and deed. If your child is selfish 
and greedy, it is in your power to make it thoughtful and considerate 
of others. The selfish child can be so infused with higher reason as 
not only to give but to give willingly and gladly to another in more 
need what it would gladly keep itself If its natural disposition be 
to recklessness and prodigality, it is the father who can infuse pru- 
dence, which is a Christian virtue, and instil habits of forethought, 
discernment, carefulness and moderation. 

But if Baby comes into the school of Home as a learner whom the 
parents must teach the alphabet of life, it is also a teacher sent from 
God. You may learn from your little one more than you can teach 
it, for it comes to you unspotted by the world, and the simplicity of 
childhood is often wiser than the shrewdness of old age. Well has 
the poet said : 

" O dearest, dearest child ! My heart 
For better love would seldom yearn 
Could I but teach the hundredth part 
Of what from thee I learn." 

The chief lessons that Baby teaches in the home are love, sym- 
pathy, patience, faith, trust, and self-denial. It draws you out of your- 
self and brings out the noblest part of you. How the first baby has 
humanized and softened many a harsh and selfish father ! The stern 
face relaxes into smiles at the sight of its little image free from its 
wrinkles and its blemishes. It is a great thing for the father when 
he has to make sacrifices and give up selfish indulgences for the sake 
of his child. He becomes as a little child, and is himself born again 
and renovated in this humanizing and refining process. His little son 
becomes his " alter-ego" his other and better self His little daughter 
is a delight to his eyes and a new warmth to his heart. Each week 
and month he lives more in his child and less in himself The power 
of parental sympathy steals over his heart like gentle dew from

heaven, freshening the ground it falls upon. It is sometiipes trying 
to his nerves after a hard day's work to be kept awake by Baby's 
c«ying, but it will refresh him more than sleep if he bethinks him 
how soon pain and prayer begin in this life, and that all the members 
of the human family, however wise and strong they think themselves, 
are but as 

" Children crying in the night, 
And with no language but a cry." 

But it is with babies as with grown people. Life is not all tears 
and crying, all pain and discord. " Heaviness may endure for a night, 
but joy Cometh in the morning." And when, after the night of cry- 
ing, the morning of happiness and health breaks upon the infant's 
face and it chirrups with a sense of life and spreads its little arms out 
as though, like the Good Shepherd himself, it would enfold the uni- 
verse in its affection, oh, then, how pleasant is dear baby to look upon ! 
And speaking of that chirrup, that inarticulate but to the quick ear 
of parental affection always intelligible sign, how wonderful is the 
imperceptible progress by which the young child learns to talk ! 
What language it will speak will depend upon what it hears, for 
speaking is learned by hearing. It will catch in time not only the 
vernacular but even the dialect and accent of its parents. When little 
ones talk slang we can tell what the language of their home is. Let 
us be careful how we speak, as well as what we speak, in their pres- 
ence. But how passing strange it is to reflect that a little accident, 
like that of nationality or birthplace, will decide the vehicle in which 
they will think and utter their thoughts through life. If they hear 
French in the nursery, they will speak French some day, perhaps, on 
the platform and in the market-place. If their parents' language is 
the English, then we shall find them talking English from the nursery 
to the grave. One of the greatest of modern philologers, who knew 
all the languages spoken by civilized nations, muttered some strange 
words on his death-bed, and then whispered, " This is the language 
which they speak in heaven." It was not French, nor English, nor 
German, nor Italian, nor Russian, that he spoke ; it was, perhaps, a 



72 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

language he had evolved from all of them which he muttered with 
his last breath, and called the language of the heavenly land. The 
thought is beautiful and may be true, that the clearest speech and 
most copious tongue on earth is but a prelude to the symphonies 
that angel-tongues pour forth in heaven. But whatever the vowels 
and the consonants, and whatever the pronunciation of them, may 
lyour Baby learn to speak the language of the heart, for that is always 
listened to in the presence of God. That is, indeed, a universal 
language, better than Greek or Latin, English or French. It is the 
password at the celestial gates, the conversation of the celestial home. 
Through it your little child discourses to the spheres. By it he is 
known among the stars as the child of God. Science teaches us that 
sound is never lost, that language never dies ; but that the spoken 
word vibrates on the ear of time and is borne on and on in ever-widen- 
ing circles. Words spoken thousands of years ago are musical and 
sonorous to-day. Whatever the origin of language may have been, 
the language of the heart flows directly from the heart of the All- 
Father who bids his children call to him from every nook and corner 
of the world. Your Baby when it moves its pretty lips is trying to 
repeat that language, and the angels pause to listen and catch its 
inmost thought. The heart-language of its future life will be noted 
by those angels, whose ears are the telephones of God, and whose 
eyes do always behold the Heavenly Father's Face. God bless the 
Baby in the Home !

'HERE is a cry for " Help" all over the land. It is not 
because our houses are on fire or we are besieged by 
burglars, or have fallen into the river and don't know 
how to swim. It is not because the highwayman 
holds a pistol to our nose and says, " Your money or 
your life ! " It is not because the roof has fallen in, and we are 
struggling in vain to get our limbs out of the ruins. It is not the 
cry of the beggar who has lost the use of his eyes and can only see 
clearly to count his money when nobody is looking. It is not from 
the unfortunate who has fallen into a ditch and is too fat to crawl out. 
It is not from the starving and the homeless who appeal to our 
charity. It is not from the missionary society who want more money 
to send fresh ministers to the Cannibal Islands because the last batch 
have been eaten up. It is not from the hunter whom a grizzly has 
driven up a tree, and who is afraid to come down to be hugged by 
the brute who is quietly sitting on his hind legs to receive him. It 
is not from persons who want to borrow money, or build school- 
houses in the wilderness, or churches at the North Pole. It is none 
of these, although they are heard often enough. It is a cry for 
help, " Up-stairs, down-stairs, and in my lady's chamber." It means, 
" Can you tell me of a good servant ? " 

(73) 



74 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

In the great majority of American families this is the cry, and it 
is a cry for the most necessary article in a well-to-do family, and the 
one which is the most difficult to get. If you have money in your 
purse, you may go out and buy what you please at the market and 
in the stores. But some of the richest people in the land find it the 
hardest thing in the world to get a good servant. They can get 
help in plenty, but not the right sort. If walls have ears, as they say, 
they must get quite tired listening to some such conversations as 
this, which are to be constantly heard in the houses of the wealthy 
and those who are able to pay for help : 

" My dear Mrs. So-and-so, I am delighted to see you looking so 
well. How is Mr. So-and-so, and how are the children?" 

" Thank you, they are all pretty well ; but you must excuse my 
having the broom and dust-pan in my hand. The fact is, we are all 
upside-down and I am driven out of my wits." 

" Dear me, Mrs. S., you quite alarm me. I hope nothing serious 
has happened." 

" Serious enough, indeed ! I am without a servant. My house- 
maid left me last week, and my cook went off yesterday." 

" Indeed, my dear Mrs. S., how you surprise me ! Why, when I 
last saw you, you seemed delighted with your new girl, and said that 
after trying six in three months you had at last found a treasure. 
Pray put your dusting-brush down and tell me all about it, for the 
fact is I called partly to ask you if you could recommend me a nurse 
for the children, thinking you had been more fortunate with servants 
than myself, for I have changed my nursery maid thirteen times since 
New Year's." 

" Then, my dear friend, we can indeed feel for each other. Pray 
tell me why your last girl left." 

" For the first week she suited me very well, but what do you 
think? My husband awoke me one night and said he smelt smoke, 
and that something must be burning. After sniffing for some seconds 
to satisfy myself that the poor, dear man was not dreaming, I got up, 
lit a candle, and proceeded to make an investigation. Going up- 



"UP-STAIRS, DOWN-STAIRS, IN MY LADY's CHAMBER." 75 

Stairs, to the girl's bedroom, I looked in, for I always keep the key 
of the door so that the maids may not lock themselves in, for they 
would sleep till all hours if they were free from intrusion. What do 
you think ? The creature had fallen asleep with a dime love-story in 
her hand, and on a chair beside her was a tallow candle which was 
slowly burning the ends of her back hair. But for my husband's 
nose it must soon have caught her bed, and the creature would 
have been a conflagrated corpse, besides burning the house down!" 

" How dreadful, to be sure ! Did she come well recommended 
from her last place ? " 

"Yes, indeed; she had lived at Mr. Smith's, the minister's, who 
is himself a great sitter up o' nights at his studies. The girl herself 
told me this, and said she thought she was doing right in improving 
her mind in the night-time. But this was not all. On opening her 
box to see if she kept matches or dynamite, I found a whole budget 
of love-letters, no doubt the result of dime novel reading. I got rid 
of her in the morning, for fear the inflammable Miss might set fire 
to the children or set her cap for the coachman." 

-"Goodness! how horrible! who can be safe, with such servants, 
from being burned alive in their beds ! But my own luck with my 
last girl, Mary Ann, was little better. I shall never believe in faces 
again as long as I live. You must know that I had engaged to spend 
the day a little way out of town, but lost the train and had to wait 
two hours for another. I thought I would fill up the time by making 
a call or two. Just imagine my consternation on turning down High 
street to come face to face with my own servant, dressed in my dark- 
green silk, second best bonnet with the ostrich plumes, lavender kid- 
gloves, and my flowered silk parasol in her hand. She looked ready 
to drop when she caught my eye, and darted across the street. But 
a policeman was at hand and took her to the station-house, where 
the matron took my things off her. The girl's penitence seemed sin- 
cere when she thought she had to borrow a policeman's overcoat to 
get home in. I would have sent her to state's prison, but my hus- 
band is a patriot and was much moved when she assured us that her 
great-grandfather lost both legs in the Revolutionary war." 



76 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

" Why did you allow your husband's weakness to interfere with 
justice? Such creatures ought to wear a prison dress and pick 
oakum for the good of society. What are we coming to when our 
own dry-goods are not safe ? And, by the way, you remember that 
blue velvet mantilla of mine that I bought in New York last fall? 
It disappeared about the same time as Susanna, my fifth housemaid 
before the last. But the creature's admirer was in the dyeing busi- 
ness and might have turned it pea-green, so I took no steps to re- 
cover it. It costs more than a thing is worth to prove one's owner- 
ship." 

" How about your stout cook, Matilda Pancake, who suited you 
so well?" 

" So she did at first, but I found out within a month that she had a 
weakness for lager beer, which she drank by the gallon. At such 
times, she was at first convivial and only noisy, but when she came 
into my parlor, while I was receiving some visitors, and abused me 
to my face, I ordered her to pack her things and be off ' Not with- 
out a month's wages ! ' says she ; and when I refused to pay it, she 
smashed half my crockery. She called next day to apologize, and 
said she suffered with a hot tefnper caused by standing over the fire. 
But, of course, one's life and limbs are not safe with a cook who 
drinks, so I refused to take her back. My husband said we had 
better try and get along without a cook after such an experience, and 
that he would try not to mind it as he could dine at the club." 

" You remember that girl Lucretia Muffins, whom I engaged be- 
cause her father was a baker and she professed to be skilful in making 
bread and pastry. I heard a great kicking on the kitchen floor one 
morning, and found the poor thing in a fit all covered with paste. It 
seemed, from her statement to our doctor whom I sent for, that she 
has the St. Vitus' dance, which comes on whenever she works hard. 
She is now in the female wing of the Epileptic Sanitarium. But 
I am talking you to death with my own troubles when you have 
enough of your own. Do tell me how you manage to get a dinner, 
and if you have a good cook." 



" UP-STAIRS, DOWN-STAIRS, IN MY LADY's CHAMBER." 'J'J 

" I have been almost as unfortunate as yourself, my dear Mrs. S. 
At present I have no cook at all, and my nursemaid, Barbara, and 
myself have to get the dinners the best way we can. To save trouble, 
I generally cook a quarter of mutton, or round of beef, all at once, so 
that it may last cold all the week. It does very well, for my poor 
husband seems to have no appetite lately, and his business keeps him 
away at meal times a great deal. But I should make your blood 
run cold if I told you why I parted with my last cook, Lucinda 
Waffles. My maid, Barbara, tells it thrillingly now that Waffles is 
gone, for, would you believe it, the wretch threatened her life with 
the rolling-pin if she ever breathed a word. All I know of the matter 
is that my bills became enormous after Lucinda Waffles came to me. 
I engaged her on the strength of her advertisement and the reference 
she gave me to a merchant in the city, who was strikingly like the 
brother just arrived from India, who spent the Sunday mornings 
with her in the kitchen when we were all away at church, and only 
Barbara was left at home to assist in getting the dinner ready. 

" The way the Cincinnati smoked hams vanished would have par- 
alyzed me if I had not more than I could do in counting the new- 
laid eggs which disappeared as quickly as they were brought into 
the house. Bread, butter, cheese, pickles, fruit, pie, and spring 
chickens vanished in the same mysterious manner. My suspicions 
were at length aroused, and I questioned Lucinda Waffles, but could 
get no satisfaction. She disputed my remark that things couldn't 
walk off without legs. Hams shrunk in the cooking, eggs were 
very scarce, cold roast beef was very deceptive owing to the quan- 
tity of bone in it, and so forth. ' Lucinda,' I answered, 'you are de- 
ceiving me. The butcher's bill is just double since you came. I 
feed you liberally, but I will have no more waste.' But matters 
went on as before, and I then noticed that little Barbara, my maid, 
seemed in great fear of Waffles, the cook, and trembled whenever 
she saw her with the rolling-pin in her hand. One day I questioned 
Barbara closely. ' Please, m'm, don't ask me nothing, m'm, for its 
more'n my life's worth to tell. Waffles has sworn to kill me with 



78 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

the rolling-pin if I tell on her.' With much difficulty I persuaded 
the girl to reveal all she knew. The brother from India was always 
let in at the back door when every member of the family had gone 
out at the front. Lucinda sat on his knee and cooked ham and 
eggs for him in quantities that proved he got no meals anywhere 
else. I discharged the creature at once without mentioning poor 
Barbara, who was frightened out of her wits. The brother from 
India called for Waffles' baggage." 

Such are the conversations that may be heard in thousands of 
homes from mistresses who can't get servants and whose cry is 
"Help!" 

This, however, is only one side of the domestic picture. The 
servants often have grievances as well as the mistresses. If too 
little is expected of them' in one way, too much is demanded in an- 
other. If one rein is too loose, another is too tight. They are 
allowed to take liberties at one time only to be severely checked at 
another. The mistress will often demean herself by talking scandal 
about her neighbors with her own servant and then complain that 
the servant does the same by her. The relative positions of mistress 
and servant, employer and employe, requires that the one should set 
a proper example to the other. But how can the servant be ex- 
pected to govern her temper when the mistress has no control of 
her own? 

It may be said that in a republican country like our own, where 
everybody is everybody's equal and a good deal superior to every- 
body in his own esteem, it is impossible to observe class distinc- 
tions and treat those whom we employ as they are treated in the old 
countries, where the social scale is graduated from the monarch to 
the mendicant. "Our servant would not stay with us unless she 
were treated as one of ourselves," is a remark which one frequently 
hears in all sections of the country, and it has a right side and a 
wrong side. The right side is that you must remember that your 
servant has a proper self-respect and dignity of feeling as well as 
yourself Her heart, indeed, may be warmer and less selfish than 



UP-STAIRS, DOWN-STAIRS, IN MY LADY S CHAMBER." 79 

yours. Her mind may be finer than yours if she had enjoyed the 
privileges of governess, and school, and finishing masters as you 
did when a girl. Down deep in the current of her nature may be a 
refinement and delicacy of feeling which is not natural to yourself. 
In point of fact, if the relative circumstances of birth, money, and 
education had been changed, the mistress and the maid might oc- 
cupy each other's positions. 

" When Adam delved, and Eve span, 
Where was then the gentleman? " 

But this does not change existing facts. A contract is a contract, 
and both parties are bound by it. Service may not be one's choice, 
but when accepted it should be faithfully performed. The person 
who accepts it may have an inner consciousness of being worthy of 
a higher vocation, but, as a rule, those who have a right to this feel- 
ing are those who will discharge best whatever duties they under- 
take. Bad servants prove by their unfaithfulness that they are not 
worthy of a higher trust. 

One great cause of the discontent of servants is the false idea that 
there is something degrading to one's self-respect in the service of 
others. But if this were so, no man or woman in the world would 
be self-respecting, because all of us, from the highest to the lowest, 
are dependent on one another. A prince or a president is more de- 
pendent on his servants than they are upon him. To " suckle fools 
and chronicle small beer" is a position of immense responsibility. 
No kind of honest work is degrading, and faithful servants are the 
salvation of the world. If every woman wore silks, who would wear 
home-spun? If every one rode in her carriage, who would walk 
on foot? If we all sat in the drawing-room, who would attend to 
the kitchen? 

" If wishes were horses, beggars would ride," 

but who would feed the horses and keep the stables in order? 

There is nothing mean in the service of others. It is the servant 
who can degrade the service, not the service the servant. Those 



80 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

who would climb the ladder of life must go up step by step. Yet 
many who accept domestic service in this country seem to think 
that the whole United States ought to go out to meet them when they 
land from Ireland, or Germany, or Norway, or Sweden, and put rings 
on their fingers and bells on their toes. The women expect to see 
the shores lined with unfortunate bachelors whom the native female 
population does not suffice to provide with wives. The emigration 
societies of the old world aid in spreading this delusion, and single 
women think themselves as much in demand here as potatoes were 
in Ireland in the days of famine. The spinster of uncertain age 
thinks she has only to set her foot on American soil to be wooed 
and won, before she has even had time to unpack her baggage, by a 
well-to-do farmer who will conduct her to a farm well tilled, which, 
only needed her presence to make a home of it. She has yet to 
learn that wives and of the very best quality are among the native 
productions of the American soil. It is they who have made our 
wilderness to "blossom as the rose." 

Still, there is a fair chance of a home of her own for every likely 
girl who comes here, and there is no better way of getting ready for 
it, than by helping to keep in order the homes of others. Whiie 
she is attending to other people's children she is preparing herself 
for managing her own. If she lets her mistress's baby fall into the 
wash-tub, she ought not to expect that any young man who sees 
her carelessness will propose to her. 

But if she be faithful and kind, industrious and patient, she will 
soon feel at home in the home of her employers. She will win their 
respect and then their affection. No treasure is felt to be so valuable 
as a confidential servant, when the confidence has been gained, not 
by liberties taken, but by interests protected. To the nurse-maid 
mothers intrust the darlings of their home. Upon her care and 
intelligence their safety and frequently their lives depend. The 
mother cannot help loving those that love her children. To be kind 
to them is to win a warm place in her regard. 

The home may have many antiquarian relics. The old Family 



"UP-STAIRS, DOWN-STAIRS, IN MY LADY's CHAMBER." 8 1 

Bible may be there, recording the .births, marriages and deaths of 
many generations. Old trees may stand around the family roof-tree. 
Old keepsakes may adorn the mantel-shelves; old portraits hang 
upon the walls, and old dresses, some of them old bridal dresses, be 
treasured in the closets, but more precious than all of these is the 
faithful old servant who has become one of the family by years of 
endearing service in it. When Joseph had served Pharaoh faithfully, 
so that he had become essential to his kingdom, he made him ruler 
of his household, and said to him, " Only in the throne will I be' 
greater than thou." Every one should know his or her place, and 
each one's place is just his own ; the one in which his duties are, 
and neither the place above nor the place below him. 

In order to do this, mutual forbearance as well as mutual confi- 
dence must prevail on both sides. There must be no treasuring 
up of little vexations until they estrange mistress and maid from each 
other. Every stone of offence should be removed at once, as we go 
along, and not left until a heap accumulates. Little trials are often 
far more difficult to bear than great ones, just as the sting of a 
mosquito irritates the skin worse than a good slap with the open 
hand. Let mistress and servant try to alleviate and as much as 
possible prevent the little trials of domestic life. Suppose, oh, 
servant, that you let the fire go out at the hour when your mistress 
will return tired with a journey and need a cup of tea. Will it make 
the kettle boil to tell her you are sorry, but that you forgot all about 
it ? If you are the cook and allow the dinner to spoil, and pour 
catsup over the pudding, and sweet sauce over the meat, while you 
deluge your pastry with salt in mistake for powdered sugar, and 
use cayenne as you would common pepper, will it restore peace of 
mind and stomach to the family to tell them that your sight is not as 
good as it was, and that " things are not what they seem " to you ? 
If you drop hairpins and bodkins into your home-made bread, will 
it undo the horrible tortures you have inflicted on those who have 
swallowed it if you say that the baker's man or the butcher's boy 
rang the bell in your hour ol knead and put you in a flurry? If you

tread upon your master's gouty toe, will your begging his pardon 
make the weight of your heel less painful ? 

If you feel it very hard to be so often scolded by your mistress, 
don't you think that she feels it very hard to have to tell you the 
same thing half a dozen times in the course of the day ? She has 
told you not to slam doors, or kick them or put your weight against 
them, but to turn the knob and the lock. Yet you will keep on 
banging the door every time you enter or leave a room. This is 
torture even to the eyes and ears of mere visitors who happen to be 
present : what must it be to the patient mistress who tries, for your own 
sake as well as for hers, to make a good and thorough servant of you ? 
And then what a weight of woe there is in an untidy servant ! She 
scatters pins and needles wherever she goes instead of blessings. 
She never knows for five minutes together where she has put what you 
are looking for, and thinks it quite enough to assure you that it is 
quite safe because she remembers putting it away for safety. 

Then how frightful are the effects upon the nervous system of 
others of little peculiarities, whether of mistress or servant ! There 
is a way of looking at another person which dethrones their reason, 
and sets them topsy-turvy in a moment. A lady of the highest 
respectability went hopelessly insane because a single gentleman who 
took the rooms opposite to hers invariably stared at her with a fixed, 
sardonic leer. The old lady's reason, never very strong, gave way 
under such unusual attentions, which, of course, she interpreted as 
the deepest infatuation and the irresistible attraction of the magnet 
to the pole. Many a long night did the poor thing lie awake 
wondering when the old gentleman's eye would become more ex- 
pressive of affection, and his lips would "pop the question." But 
the time rolled on and the eye, though fixed upon her wherever she 
went with the same constancy as ever, did not soften or grow milder 
in its beam. It was a glass eye, but she did not know it. It is one 
of the most exasperating things in the world to be stared at, and if 
homicide were ever justifiable it ought to be so when applied to 
those who stare other people out of countenance. 



"UP-STAIRS, DOWN-STAIRS, IN MY LADY's CHAMBER." 83 

There are many other excruciating habits by which mistresses 
can torture their servants, and servants their mistresses. Such, for 
instance, is the habit of constantly sniffling when spoken to, and 
saying, " Yes, m'm," a word of doubtful etymology, and not to be 
found in any dictionary. If a sniff meant approval like "Amen," it 
might be tolerated ; as it is it has no meaning at all, but is a nasal 
confession of mental vacuity. So " Yes, m'm," if it meant that one's 
meaning was fully understood, and that one's wish would be obeyed, 
might be permissible, but if it have any meaning at all it signifies that 
the servant will go on saying " Yes, m'm," to the end of her days, 
and will never be any nearer than she is now to understanding or 
obeying her mistress. 

It has frequently been observed by physiologists that men and 
women have been supplied with a left hand as well as a right, and 
there is no just reason why they should not employ both instead of 
leaving all the work to the right. Servants, therefore, show a laud- 
able ambition when they endeavor to use their left hands as well as 
their right hands, and, no doubt, it is praiseworthy in them to use 
them both at the same time whenever they are trying to do two 
things at once. Yet tea-cups and saucers, tumblers and wine-glasses, 
china tea-sets and coffee-sets, meat-plates and soup-plates, and fruit- 
plates, tureens and jugs, sauce ladles and bric-a-brac all cost a good 
deal of money, and it is very trying to see them destroyed at the rate 
of one or two a week by one of these ambitious servants, who always 
has both hands full in trying to do two things at the same time. 

Many a mistress has died of nervous prostration brought on by 
the violent palpitation and nervous excitement caused by constantly 
seeing her new servant try how high a pyramid of plates she can 
carry in one hand, while she is tilting an irregular pile of cups and 
saucers in the other. When she slips and they go down, as much 
injury has been done to the poor mistress' constitution and as many 
nails have been knocked in her coffin as if she had lived to the age 
of Methuselah in that horrible five minutes. The habit of humming, 
muttering or talking to one's self in each other's company is repre- 



84 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

hensible, whether in servant or mistress. It is no excuse for making 
hideous sounds that you are singing one of Mr. Sankey's favorite 
hymns to a tune of your own. 

Grease spots on carpets have often turned the mutual gratitude 
and affection of mistress and servants for each other into the most 
implacable animosity. It is, indeed, more than flesh and blood can 
bear to see'the cruet-stand or the ink-stand upset upon a new Brus- 
sels or tapestried carpet, all for want of the very commonest care. A 
girl will stand with her mouth wide open and her eyes staring while 
from either hand a vessel of grease is pouring its liquid treasures on to 
the carpet. These are the times that try mistress' souls. 

Many servants will exert an amount of industry and ingenuity in 
making a bed so hilly, uneven, misshapen, and uncomfortable that no 
one can get a wink of sleep upon it, when they might have made it 
up comfortably for one-half the time and pains. Whatever is worth 
doing, is worth doing well, applies to tidying a room as much as to 
making a dress. " Many a mickle makes a muckle," is an old Scotch 
proverb, and it is one which domestic servants should lay to heart. 
One pin, or burnt lucifer match, upon one's parlor carpet, if unre- 
buked, would in time result in carpets strewn with threads, crumbs, 
needles, bits of paper, snips of ribbon, locks of hair, etc., 

" Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks 
In Vallambrosa." 

Some servants will leave water in a basin for the person who 
next uses it to empty. They don't put back what they take down. 
Their shelves are in a litter. Their pantry is without order. Their 
sleeping-room is left to take care of itself Their kitchen is always 
upside down. They take no proper pride in their own personal ap- 
pearance, thinking finery on a holiday and a clean show on a Sunday 
an offset for untidiness and slovenliness on week-days. 

If I have mentioned many faults of carelessness and stupidity in 
servants, it is because I esteem their calling to be one of the most 
respectable upon earth. In many countries the faithful servant is 



"UP-STAIRS, DOWN-STAIRS, IN MY LADY's CHAMBER." 85 

provided for to the end of his or her life. They not only have com- 
forts which their relatives cannot obtain, such as better dwelling and 
food, but they have opportunities for self-improvement which other 
modes of living do not supply. It has been said that no man is a 
hero to his valet, because he is seen by his servants as he really is, 
not with his " quality manners " on. But every master and mistress 
should be able to bear this constant survey, and should win the re- 
spect and esteem of their servants by justice, kindness and noble living. 
The good and faithful master is one of nature's noblemen ; the kind 
mistress, who is ever ready to advise her servants and guide them in 
their duty, is a crown to her husband and her home ; and the good 
servant, in the highest sense, is a masterpiece of Christian civilization. 
She is no slave, except as all of us are the slaves of circumstances to 
a certain extent. 

The position of a servant ought to come next in honor to that of 
a teacher. Indeed, servants are for good or ill the teachers of chil- 
dren, who make them their confidants and take their views and im- 
pressions from their conversation and precepts. In this country good 
servants are very difficult to get, for reasons that have already been 
mentioned, but when they are found, they are highly valued and not 
lightly parted with. The biographies of old servants would make a 
very interesting volume of domestic literature. Few have such op- 
portunities for observing character and learning to sympathize with 
the trials of others. There are training schools for servants, as there 
are for teachers, but a quick and willing girl can learn more from a 
good mistress in her first place than from hearing lectures or learning 
rules. Some girls are " butter-fingered," as the saying is, by nature, 
and it is hard work and takes a rough experience to make them finger- 
sure, so that they can avoid breaking, slipping and spilling. There 
was a famous cook who had to prepare sumptuous dinners for his 
master's . table. They were so numerous when his master gave a 
dinner-party that he found it difficult to avoid forgetting something. 
So he arranged a Tong row of pegs and hung upon each peg a paper 
cap, and before preparing each dish he put on one of the caps, and 



86 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

when the dish was finished he threw the cap down. So he went 
through with all the dishes and the caps. How happy is that servant 
who, when each day's work is done, can throw down the cap of re- 
sponsibility with the knowledge that nothing has been forgotten, or 
done badly, or left undone, but that when the tired body lies down to 
rest the mind may say, " I have done my day's work thoroughly ! " 
That thoroughness will make the work grow pleasant to you. You 
will feel like an artist when he has finished his picture and sees the 
colors all in harmony, without daubs and patches, but harmonious 
and life-like. 

To acquire this self-confidence and self-respect, the servant should 
never put off till to-morrow what can be done to-day. Procrastina- 
tion is the thief of time. Don't leave the washing up of the break- 
fast things until after dinner, or the tidying up till the end of the 
week. Hate dirt with an intense hatred. Resist the cobwebs and 
they will flee from you. Don't let the milk turn sour through the 
heat before you put it in the cooler. Have an eye frequently on the 
kitchen clock, and remember that " moments are ages " in their results, 
and that a meal not ready, a dish spoiled, a home in disorder has 
driven many a man to the tavern and made him feel never less at 
home than when at home. 

Let not the servant think, " I am only a servant," and therefore of 
no consequence, for her employers do not so think of helping hands 
which they cannot do without. It is the hand of the servant that 
keeps the machinery of home in order.

^ E are very glad to record the fact that the period in 
woman's history in the United States has been reached 
when it is no longer regarded as unladylike to indulge 
in any recreative sport or exercise which calls for an 
unwonted degree of muscular exertion or activity. On 
the contrary, it has now come to be decidedly out of 
fashion for a healthy young girl to be unable to hold her own credit- 
ably in either one or the other of the several out-door exercises or 
games in which it is possible for ladies to excel. The education of a 
girl may very justly be said to be incomplete, mentally as well as 
physically, unless she has been benefited by that activity of mind 
and body which results from a practical familiarity with the out-door 
games suitable for the fair sex' to engage in. What with equestrian 
exercise on the Park drives or the country road ; rowing in a light 
boat on a suburban lake ; forming one of a quartette at lawn tennis 
or croquet ; being one of the contestants at an archery meeting, or 
joining a girls' pedestrian party for an early morning five-mile walk, 
a charming variety of healthy out-door exercises and recreative 
sports is presented which a moderate indulgence in during leisure 
time from important home duties will yield roseate hues to the 
cheeks, brightness to the eyes and an elasticity of mind which no

cosmetic or drug known to the materia medica can possibly produce. 
It is a well-known physiological fact that the circulation of the 
blood to the surface of the body, induced by out-door exercise, which 
gives life and activity to the functions of the skin, and through that 
medium healthy action to the vital organs of the system, results in a 
magical influence on the moral forces of the mind, in bringing into 
play good nature in place of ill-feeling, and in substituting a healthy 
mental condition for those morbid sensations which result from a 
neglect of physical exertion of a recreative nature. It is only when 
the physical machinery of the body is in thorough working order 
that the more delicate mental organization finds its most healthful 
existence. 

The list of out-door sports and exercises in which the fair sex can 
engage with health and pleasure includes walking, rowing, swim- 
ming, skating — on the ice and on parlor rollers — archery, lawn 
tennis and croquet. The prominent in-door recreative exercises and 
games include calisthenics, bowling, billiards, chess, draughts, back- 
gammon, dominoes, and such games with cards as whist and crib- 
bage. It would require too much space, and be beyond the intended 
scope of this work, to introduce into the descriptive chapters of each 
sport or exercise any but the mere elementary instructions in re- 
gard to acquiring a practical knowledge of them. This we now 
proceed to do briefly and to the point : 

LAWN TENNIS. 

The now fashionable game of Lawn Tennis is essentially a field 
sport adapted for ladies. Its requirements are not such as to de- 
mand an amount of physical exertion for which an ordinarily healthy 
girl is not capable ; and its playing rules, too, are not so intricate as 
to require special mental ability to fully comprehend them. The bat 
used in the game is light and easy to handle, even by delicate hands, 
while the rubber ball played with — weighing not quite two ounces — 
is quite harmless, even if it should happen to hit the face of a 
player. The game affords the most enjoyable exercise of any field

game in vogue in which ladies can participate, and it can be readily 
played on a plot of level ground seventy-five feet by thirty in length 
and width. The game can be played by two, three or four ladies, 
either with one player on each side, or two on a side, or one against*?* 
two. The following are the lines and measurements of a lawn tennis 
court, according to the laws of the United States Lawn Tennis Asso-

The appended cut shows a lawn tennis field with four players en- 
gaged in a match. 

When two players engage in a match the game is played as fol- 
lows : A begins play by taking up her position at the outer corner 
of the right-hand court, and standing with one foot on one side of 
the " service " line and the other foot on the other side, she takes 
her bat in one hand and the ball in the other, and proceeds to "serve" 
the ball to her opponent, who stands in her right-hand court on the 
other side of the net, ready to return the ball back to the server's 
court. The " server " must bat the ball so that it will go over the 
net and fall within the right court of her opponent's field. If she 
fails to do this, and the ball either hits the net or goes beyond the 
court lines, a '^ fault " is recorded, and two " faults " in succession 
count as an "ace" against the "server." If the ball is rightly

" served," however, then the server's opponent must endeavor to bat 
the served ball — after it has touched the ground within the court 
once and before it touches the ground a second time — so that it be 
returned over the net to the server's ground. Failing to do this, an 
" ace " is scored to the credit of the server. If the player, returning 
the ball, sends it over the net, and it falls anywhere within the outer 
lines of the courts, the server has then to return it over the net back 
again, and in doing this she can either bat it after the first bound, or

before it touches the ground — a batted fly ball being known as a 
" volley." The game is scored as follows : The first ace made 
counts 15, the second 30, the third 40 and the fourth gives game. 
The player who first scores six games wins the first "sei" of the 
match, and two sets won, out of three played or to be played, wins the 
match. When both players have scored "40," or four aces each, then 
•• deuce " is called, and the player who scores the next ace after the 
40 is credited with vantage, and the next ace in succession gives the

ARCHERY. 

There is no field sport a lady can engage in which is so well cal- 
culated to induce a healthy development of the chest and arms, or to 
impart grace of movement; as the recreation of the Archery field 






•'\7-T^-"^-" 




ARCHERY. 



To manage her beau well in the parlor is an art every lively girl of 
course delights in ; yet to handle her bow creditably in front of the 
target at an archery meeting is to many equally attractive. Practice 
with the bow and arrow gives a girl the very kind of exercise she is 
most in need of, and that is, exercise of the muscles of the chest. 
Of course, a class of calisthenic exercises will produce the same 
result, but in a different manner, the latter being more mechanical 



92 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

and less recreative than that of archery practice, there being a 
decided difference between the methodical work of a calisthenic class 
and the pleasurable excitement incident to shooting with a bow and 
arrow at a target, surrounded by all the attractions of a field archery 
meeting. One is, in a measure, work, while the other is enjoyable 
exercise and play; and exercise that is not fully recreative in its 
nature is not very beneficial in a sanitary point of view. Standing in 
front of an archery target thirty yards distant, and watching the 
movements of a practised archeress, as she grasps her bow, places an 
arrow in position, and then with comparative ease sends it flying to 
the centre of the " gold," the whole action, with its final result, looks 
so easy of attainment that a casual observer is deceived in an estimate 
of the amount of patient practice that is necessary to accomplish the 
feat. But when the young novice tries her hands at this apparently 
simple act, and realizes by practical experiment what difficulties beset 
her, and what a number of things she has to learn before she can 
even hit the target at all, not to mention the " gold," her respect for 
the sport increases in the ratio of the obstacles she meets with. To 
become expert in the use of her bow gives a girl of brains something 
to reflect upon, something to study up and to analyze as to cause 
and effect ; and with this naturally comes hearty respect for the art 
and a love for the enjoyable excitement it yields. Any novice in 
archery who has ultimately achieved success will tell you what a 
thrill of pleasure she felt when, after weeks of disappointing practice, 
blunders in handling her bow, mistakes in "nocking" her arrows, 
errors of getting into " bad form " in taking up her position to shoot, 
and in other ways experiencing all the little shocks to one's amour 
propre which novices are heirs to, she all at once gets into " good 
form," and as a result sees her arrow enter the magic circle of the 
" gold," and that, too, not by chance but by the skill which her final 
mastery of the art yields. It is then that the exclamation comes, 
" Isn't that perfectly elegant ? " It is then, too, that she has passed the 
outer works of archery and captured its citadel. In no sport a lady 
can engage in does the old saying that " practice makes perfect " 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES, 93 

apply with such force as to archery. There are so many little but 
important details to be attended to which constant practice can alone 
make you properly familiar with, that any regular rule for special 
observance fails to be advantageously applicable. It is all very well to 
put down in a book of instructions in the art that the young novice 
must do this, that and the other ; but it is by practical experience in 
the field only, and frequent practice at that, that she will be enabled 
to overcome the obstacles she has to encounter in her efforts to 
become an expert. 

The first thing to be attended to after familiarizing herself with the 
handling of the bow and arrows is to bear in mind the important 
fact that the word " aim," as applied in all other methods of shooting, 
is, in archery, inapplicable. In shooting with a bow you look solely 
at the centre of the target, and not to the point of your arrow or at 
any part of your bow. From the moment that you have your bow 
and arrow in position and in readiness for the final " loose " — letting 
go the string — your sight or aim must be upon the centre of the 
target. The difference is, that in archery you feel your aim, as it 
were, while in shooting with a rifle you see it. This aiming by 
instinct cari only be attained by constant practice. The details to be 
made familiar with before you can even send your first arrow into any 
part of the target are enough to engage one's attention, outside of 
the mental training necessary in learning to shoot with special 
accuracy of aim. To hold your bow firmly and steadily, as if it were 
in a vice, is the first letter of the archer's alphabet. The second is to 
bend your bow to the arrow's head properly, and the third is to 
" loose " the cord from the fingers of your right hand at the proper 
moment. This is the A. B. C. of archery. Then come the placing 
of the arrow in position and seeing that it is " nocked " — attached to 
the cord — in the right place on the string ; and also that the right 
feather of the arrow is uppermost, and that the tips of your fingers are 
properly placed on the string ready for the full and the final " loose." 
How to stand at ease while using your bow is also an important 
matter. You do not face the target, as in shooting a rifle, but you 



94 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

stand as described in the dueling code, with the left side of your 
body facing the target, so that in looking at the target it is with 
your face turned toward your left shoulder. The left arm, which 
grasps the bow, must be kept steady, and held out with firm, 
unmoving muscles. This arm is the lever on which you depend for 
a straight delivery of the arrow. As it is raised or lowered, so will 
your arrow fly high or low. If the arm, too, be allowed to bend, 
the power to draw the bow to the arrow's head steadily is lessened. 
Then, too, there is the -action of the right arm in pulling the cord 
forward. In doing this, unused muscles are brought into play, and 
at first the motion will feel like that of a constrained position. 
Ladies whose chest muscles are little exercised, and whose arms 
are weak from want of employment, find that this new exercise comes 
rather hard upon them, but its physical advantages are suiificiently 
great to repay all the pains taken in the training. When you have 
learned to pull the cord correctly, you will have to attend to letting it 
slip from your fingers. In the first place, you must wear " tips " — 
leather coverings to three of your fingers — and these should be soft 
and pliable enough to allow the string to slip from them easily. In 
holding the cord, too, the correct way is to let the end of your arrow 
lie between your first and second finger, just sufficiently to prevent 
its slipping from the cord. Finally, stand steady ; hold your left 
arm out straight and firm ; look only at the " gold," as you bend 
your bow, and the moment your eye is on the centre of the target, 
and your bow is bent to the arrow's head, loosen your finger-hold on 
the cord, with a quick, easy motion, and if all your movements have 
been made correctly and in harmony with the thought in your mind, 
that moment will see the arrow go direct to the " gold," and just as 
often, too, as your thought and motion are in harmony. 

CROQUET. 

There is no game ladies take part in which so fully affords an 
observer of character facilities for discovering the real disposition of a 
woman, her lady-like manners and the feelings of true refinement 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES. 95 

she possesses, as Croquet does. It is a dreadfully effective method 
of testing a girl's temper, and few go through the ordeal without 
failure. Croquet is unlike every other game in vogue, owing to the 
fact that in no two cities or places in Europe or America, where it is 
played at all, is it played under the same code of rules.. In the 
United States there are the Newport rules, the Saratoga rules, the 
New York rules, the Boston rules, the Philadelphia rules, and in fact 
every place's rules as well as every club's rules, each varying in 
essential points of play, all of which necessarily leads to annoying 
differences of interpretation in every contest in which players from 
different cities take part. In England the English books of in- 
struction in the game agree only in one thing, and that is, in the 
statement that "there are hardly two lawns in England where 
croquet is played in the same manner and under the same rules in 
every respect." This of course brings about a decidedly aggravating 
condition of things, and it has been the one cause which has led to 
the decline of croquet in popularity as a field-game worthy of taking 
any special pains to become accomplished in. The prevailing 
sentiment in regard to it is, " Oh, don't let us play croquet : we shall 
only get to quarreling over it." Nevertheless, it is a game in its 
elements, so simple and easy of attainment, and one, moreover, 
requiring so little physical exertion to play it under the ordinary 
rules of play, as to cause it to fill up a gap that would, otherwise 
leave a void in field-sports for ladies. 

Given a very smooth, close-cut grass lawn, quite level, and so 
kept as to allow a ball to be accurately rolled on it ; with first-class 
mallets, balls and hoops, and well-defined and scientific rules for 
contests, and the means for deeply interesting play, marked by skillful 
strategy as well as accurate mechanical movements, are afforded, 
which are well adapted to make very attractive field-sport. This fact 
can be realized by ocular demonstration by a visit to the croquet 
lawn of Brooklyn Prospect Park any fine afternoon of the spring, 
summer or autumn months, when the scientific croquet players of 
Brooklyn are out on the lawn indulging in their favorite game. The 



96 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

contrast between the play of these experts and that of the ordinary 
picnic girls' croquet parties at the park is of course very great ; but 
it illustrates very fully the great difference between what croquet is 
capable of in first-class hands and what it actually is as it is simply 
and ordinarily played. 

Croquet is beyond question a great courting and flirting game for 
ladies. You can play and talk at the same time. Then you have 
such jolly rests between the turns for playing that ample opportunity 
is afforded for^ust the quiet little bit of talking together which girls 
love to have with their beaux on a field of a summer afternoon. 

The essential difference in the method of playing croquet may be said 
to be confined chiefly to the two ways of batting the ball with the 
mallet. These are the side stroke, by which a girl hits the ball as it 
lies on the ground at her side, and the front or straight stroke, in which 
she hits the ball while it is directly in front of her. This latter is a diffi- 
cult stroke for a girl to make accurately, on account of her dress. We 
go in for the rule which admits of any way of hitting the ball with 
the mallet which the player finds most advantageous. Next on the 
list of differences in the rules is that in which one club code prohibits 
the player from moving her own ball when she croquets that of her 
opponent, while another club's code admits of the ball being moved 
with that on which the croquet is taken ; the one being known as 
" tight croquet " and the other as " loose croquet." In this respect, 
too, we favor the rule leaving it optional with the player to use either 
the " tight " or the " loose " form. The loose croquet admits of carom 
strokes, as in billiards, either by playing a " following shot " or a 
simple carom, thus affording opportunities for strategic play which 
"tight croquet" does not admit of 

There is one peculiarity of croquet, and that is, it can be played on 
any piece of ground or turfy field on which it is possible to make a 
ball roll ; but, of course, skillful play would be impossible on a rough 
or uneven plot of ground. The turfy fields of the croquet clubs 
which play at Brooklyn Prospect Park are like billiard tables 
almost, so much care is there given to keeping the lawns well rolled

and cut. Those who desire to see a smooth, turfy field for their 
games should see that the grass is frequently cut, as then the small, 
short grass will grow up, in the place of the long weedy grass of lawns 
not frequently mowed. A croquet ground and a lawn tennis field can 
be made on the same plot of ground, as both need about the same 
space, as well as the same smooth and level surface of grassy turf 
We give a picture of an English croquet ground in a private park, 
which in size and finished surface would also make an admirable 
tennis lawn. 

The dimensions of a croquet ground regularly laid out should be 
one hundred feet in length by sixty feet in width. As to the ma- 
terials of the game, croquet sets can be purchased from three dollars 
a set up to twenty. A so-called cheap set, as a rule, is an abomina- 
tion in the sight of an expert. The balls get dry and split ; the mal- 
lets come off the handles and the hoops get bent out of shape easily. 
In regard to the use of " clips " to place on the hoops a player makes, 
these are only necessary when more than two girls play a game, their 
use avoiding disputes as to whether a hoop has been made or not. 
There is, of course, a difference in the rules as to the placing of the 
hoops, as well as to the number used — ten is the limit as to number, 
while fewer than eight are never used. The appended diagrams show 
the three most prominent forms of placing the hoops. The terms 
used in croquet are chiefly as follows : " Croquet " (pronounced 
" crowkay ") — To croquet a ball is to strike your own ball with the 
mallet when it is in contact with that of your opponent. " Roquet " 
(pronounced " rokay ") — To roquet a ball is simply to strike another 
ball. "Wired" — Your ball is"' wired" when the wire of the hoop 
prevents the stroke. " Peg " — To peg a ball is to strike the home- 
peg in proper order. 

Of the three diagrams given that of C presents the most difficulties 
in successfully running the round of the hoops. Diagram A does best 
for a small field, and that of B is the most simple of the three. The 
contestants in a game of croquet number from two to eight. Gen- 
erally, the most interesting game is that in which sides of two each 
take part.

CALISTHENICS. 
Calisthenics is the name given to the lighter class of gymnastic 
exercises, which are especially adapted for ladies. That such exer- 
cises are necessary for girls, especially from the age of six to fifteen, 
has been fully proved by experience, the neglect of them in early 
girlhood being a great drawback to growth in physical health. 
The trouble with most of the games girls indulge in when mere chil- 
dren is that they are simply the medium for the exercise of only one 
or two sets of muscles of the body, chiefly those of the legs and arms, 
and not much of the latter. In calisthenics there is a variety of move- 
ments which brings into play every muscle of the body, and that, too, 
not in the rather violent manner young men in the gymnastic classes 
are too frequently subjected to, but in a way calculated to gradually 
develop the lighter muscular fabric of a girl's system. What with 
skipping ropes and trundling hoops, girls from six to twelve have the 
means of healthy out-door exercise, but only to a limited extent. 
As they get into their teens these recreations have hitherto been 
replaced by that of dancing, as a general thing ; and even then only 
under such drawbacks as those of heated ball-rooms and the vitiated 
atmosphere of parlors on party occasions, both of which entirely 
obviate the sanitary benefits of the exercise itself It is from the 
calisthenic class exercises that girls in their teens, as well as ladies 
approaching the adult period, find the benefits they have previously 
been deprived of since they left off " play " as mere school-girls, and 
took on those sedentary habits of life peculiar to fashionable society 
girls. Thanks to the growing popularity of ladies' out-door sports, 
such as lawn tennis, rowing, archery, equestrian exercise and the like, 
the old sedentary mode of young lady life is being greatly modified, 
and American girls, under the improved method, bid fair soon to 
show as healthy physiques as the girls of the leisure-class of English 
society do. There is one special benefit to be derived from the system- 
atic exercises of the ladies' calisthenic class of a gymnasium, and that 
is, that for the two or three hours of these exercises the ladies are 
freed from the restraints imposed on their bodily movements by the 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES. lOI 

fashionable costume of the day. Clothed in the loose folds of their 
gymnasium costume, with corsets unlaced, and freedom given them 
for lung expansion ; with feet in their natural position and relieved 
from the stilted heels, and in every respect with room given them for 
the play of every muscle of their bodies, a delightful relaxation from 
the bonds of fashion is enjoyed ; and this freedom from dress restraints, 
combined with the invigorating effects of the exercise itself, imparts 
new life and action to the blood and thereby strengthens the vital 
functions of the system. Of course, calisthenic exercises are not so 
necessary to those girls who frequent the lawn tennis or archery fields, 
or who are to be seen rowing on the lake or riding on horseback on 
the park drives, as they are to the confined and unexercised fa^ion- 
able girls who are such valuable patrons of the medical fraternity. 
And just here, by the way, it is worthy of remark that a singular unan- 
imity of opinion seems to exist among a certain class of fashionable 
doctors in regard to the disadvantages of this, that and the other 
out-door exercise, and of the injurious effects of this or that in-door 
game on their young lady patients. Does it arise from the fact that 
such indulgence in healthy recreation is calculated to lessen the 
amount of sundry yearly medical bills ? 

Late improvements in the paraphernalia of calisthenic class exercises 
present facilities for home recreation of this character in which the 
girls of a single family can benefit to an extent but little less than 
in the regular gymnasiums. What the majority of girls most need 
in the way of such exercises, however, is the development of the chest 
muscles with a view to healthy lung expansion, and this is attainable 
in a parlor or the home garden-plat. How many a girl is there to be 
seen who, by her dancing practice, has trained up finely developed 
nether limbs, but who, from the total neglect of the muscles of the 
arms and chest, is left round-shouldered and with thin arms out of all 
proportion to the exercised limbs of her body ! 

SKATING. 
Skat.ng is, beyond question, the most graceful sport a girl can 
engage in, and as an out-door exercise it has no superior in its 



102 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

pleasurable excitement and delightfully recreative features. It is 
eminently a social sport, too, one suitable for the great majority; 
inasmuch as in every other recreation there is more or less isolation 
from social intercourse during a game or a contest, while in skating 
social enjoyment is a prominent characteristic. In fact, so much is 
this the case, that the sociality of a popular skating lake has come to 
be as proverbial as that of a New England Thanksgiving gathering. 
Skating, too, when viewed in a sanitary light, is a sport meriting 
public approval. Aside from its recreative objects, its advantages 
to health are manifest, especially as regards the fair sex. One of its 
prominent benefits is the constant open air exercise it yields, and 
that, too, at a season when the atmosphere is mostly charged with 
life-giving oxygen. In this special respect skating yields the most 
beneficial results to young girls, who, as a class, are great sufferers 
from the want of out-door recreation ; their neglect of it being a 
fertile cause of the delicate and sickly constitutions which are so 
numerous among the wealthy class of metropolitan society. It may 
be said with truth that two-thirds of the lives of the majority of our 
wealthy city girls are passed in the poisonous atmosphere of furnace- 
heated parlors, sitting-rooms and bed-rooms, with the result of that 
prevention of the necessary inhalation of oxygen and exhalation of 
carbon which is of such vital importance to the health of every 
human being. 

The essentials for the full enjoyment of skating are good ice on a 
safe sheet of water, such as our park lakes provide ; a pair of model 
American club skates — the best in the world ; low, flat-heeled skating 
boots, fitting snugly to the foot and with soles thick enough to hold 
the skate clamps, together with a warm, comfortable and appropriate 
skating-dress and cap. In learning to skate you must bear in mind 
the fact that, like learning any other special art, there is nothing 
which will aid you so much as confidence in your ability to ultimately 
accomplish what you are about to undertake. Confidence is especially 
essential in learning the first elements of skating. In this respect it 
is like learning to swim, the fear of falling while on your skates being 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES. 10? 

similar in Its deterring effects to the fear of sinking when first 
attempting to swim in the water. 

The first lesson in skating is to learn to walk on your skates. 
When on skates you are balancing yourself on a very narrow edge, 
and on an edge, too, which slips forward and backward very 
readily, but not sideways. First, stand firmly on your skates ; then 
learn to slide forward with your right foot, while pushing yourself 
with your left, thus : 




This is the first motion made. It is followed by the alternate use 
of both feet as sliders and propellers, and as you advance in this you 
learn to do the movement known as the " inside edge," which pro- 
duces the following curves : 




In learning to balance yourself on skates, you will find that you 
at once bring unused muscles of the ankles and lower limbs into 
play, with the necessary result of somewhat painful exercise. But 
this soon wears off, if it be not too long indulged in at a time. 
Frequent rest for the newly exercised muscles yield more satisfactory 
results than too much practice at one time. The fundamental basis 
of all expert efforts on skates is the movements made while bearing 
on the outer edge of the skate on the ice. This once attained, you 
hold tiie key to all the variations of the fancy skater's programme. 
Confidence in your ability to lean on the outer edge of your skate is 
everything. The very fear that you will surely fall if you attempt it 
is the cause of falling. " Nothing venture, nothing have " is a motto 
which comes into play admirably in practicing to skate the " outer 
roll." The lines of this movement are the very reverse, of course, 
of the inside edge motion or "inside roll," as will be seen by the 
appended diagram : 



1(S4 tHE hearthstone; or, life at home. 



If your skate has a keen edge — a requisite in skating whether for the 
expert or the novice — it is just as safe to lean over on the outer edge 
as on the inner. You imagine it is not until you have learned to do 
it ; but when you have, one will be found as simple as the other. 
Once having acquired the art of the outside roll, you enter the 
charmed circle of the fancy skater's arena. Then comes the outside 
roll backward, with the various circles, and these movements learned, 
you know the grammar of skating, and need only to see the expert 
go through all his fancy movements to become an accomplished 
skater. A prettier sight than a girl in appropriate skating costume 
doing the outside roll is difficult to find in the winter season. 

Skating on rollers varies materially from using skates on the ice. 
In the first place, in roller-skating there is none of that strain on 
the muscles of the ankles there is in ice-skating, simply because 
while standing on the rollers you stand on a flat surface the same as 
on the floor ; with the one exception, however, that you are liable to 
slip forward or backward on the rollers — but not sideways — the 
same as you are on skates. There is another essential difference 
between the two methods of skating, however, which it is very neces- 
sary to understand in learning to skate on the rollers after having 
learned to skate on the ice, and that is, that the roller skate is directed 
in its forward movement by your actions in balancing yourself; that 
is, if you wish to do the outer roll, you lean on your skate to the 
right, not force it in that direction by your foot, and to do the inside 
you lean to the inside. In learning to do the outside roll on parlor 
skates, you will find that confidence is everything. You, of course, 
cannot do fancy skating on any roller skates such as boys and girls 
use in the street, but only on those of the Plimpton patent used in 
the skating rinks. There are hundreds of variations of fancy skating 
movements capable of accomplishment on the Plimpton rollers, but 
which are impossible on the ordinary street roller skates.

WALKING. 
" Let us go out for a walk " is a common exclamation among our 
young society girls of the period, but the phrase has a variety of 
interpretations. With one class of girls it simply refers to a leisurely 
stroll along the most frequented promenade of a city, to look in at 
the shops, or to observe the latest out-door dress fashions. With 
another class it means a walk through the fashionable portion of the 
city, in pairs, of a party of boarding-school girls, under the watchful 
charge of some ancient teacher, with the chance of taking a sly 
glance at some masculine favorite en route. But walking for health- 
ful exercise alone, and in a way to receive all the benefit accruing 
from it, is too rarely attended to. The ordinary -vyalking done by 
ladies is not what walking should be, by any means. In the first 
place, to become a good walker — in the pedestrian's acceptation of 
the term — thorough attention must be paid to all the established 
rules governing the exercise, such as taking the regulation step in 
walking, swinging the arms properly, walking with upright form and 
with a thorough harmony of movement of all your limbs, and not to 
walk, as most ladies do, with their arms kept in a cramped position 
at their sides, by their cloaks or shawls, thereby obliging them to walk 
with a sort of side swing, like the waddling of a duck — a style 
peculiar to the city promenading of most of our fashionable girls. 
Then, too, in order to walk properly, the lady pedestrian must wear 
walking shoes or boots, with flat, low heels no thicker than the 
soles of the shoe, and easy fitting to the natural form of the foot. 
Walking for pleasurable and healthful exercise while wearing high- 
heeled, thin-soled and pointed-toe boots or shoes is next to im- 
possible. We laugh at the Chinese fashionable belle, whom the 
custom of her country obliges to have her feet encased in shoes so 
much too small as to induce a distortion which renders walking, even 
a short distance, perfect torture ; and yet the fashionable American 
shoe for ladies of the day is but little less an invention for deforming 
the feet, with its two-inch heel almost under the instep, and of 
shape so pointed as to cramp and distort the natural position of the 



Io6 THE HEARtHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

toe. English ladies, of the country nobility class, have their "walk- 
ing shoes," as well as their " dress shoes," as they do their riding 
habits, each fitted for its special purpose. They never think for a mo- 
ment of "doing a ten-mile morning constitutional" in high-heeled 
shoes. In fact, they could not do it ; a mile walk, even, under such 
circumstances, would cripple them, while ten miles done in ap- 
propriate walking costume gives them " good digestion to wait on 
appetite," and imparts the roseate hue of health to their cheeks and 
a bright lustre to their eyes. 

We are glad to note the fact that ladies' walking parties are be- 
coming fashionable. Walking clubs, too, comprising lady and 
gentlemen members, are coming into vogue, the object in view being 
periodical trdmps into the country, such walks occupying the best 
hours of a fine day and frequently covering a distance of twelve or 
fifteen miles. What women are capable of in the way of walking, 
under circumstances of the possession of a naturally strong and 
healthy physique, is not only shown by the tramping from camp to 
camp by Indian squaws, with their pappooses on their backs, but also 
by wealthy English country ladies, who love their walking trips as 
much as they do their equestrian exercise. Of course, to the city 
belle of delicate physique, who breathes only the vitiated air of her 
boudoir or carriage, the healthy invigoration of a fair pedestrian is 
an unknown sensation. The former manages to drawl her way 
through a fashionable dance, only to loll in bed the next day to rest 
from the work of the previous night at the party or the ball. If a 
girl is of weak physique or is sickly, or in other respects is unfitted 
for the duties of healthy girlhood, carriage riding, or taking a car 
rather than walk a few blocks, is excusable. But for a girl who has 
good limbs, healthy lungs, and is in " good form " for the require- 
ments of her position as a well-formed and healthy young lady, to 
fail in her share of walking exercise each day is something every 
such individual should be heartily ashamed of 

As regards certain sanitary rules, applicable to lady pedestrians, it 
is worthy of note to remember that walking too soon after meals is 



sPoRts And gam£s for ladies. 107 

not the regular thing to do ; nor should you proceed to sit down to 
the table too soon after a long and rather fatiguing walk. Walking 
on either a full or an empty stomach is not according to hygienic 
rules. You must bear in mind that, while exercise aids digestion, it 
is only after the food has begun to be assimilated this assistance 
is rendered. To get up from a hearty meal and proceed to any exer- 
cise beyond that of a quiet, slow-strolling kind of walk is to un- 
healthily hurry the process of digestion. It is also objectionable to 
healthy digestion to fill the stomach with food after the system has 
been subjected to over-fatigue. A little rest before eating, after a 
long walk, is very essential to good digestion. 

Walking is a natural acquirement and it should not be rendered arti- 
ficial by training or methods. The benefit of this exercise is best 
appreciated by the person who is capable of taking a great deal of it, 
while the injury resulting from a want of it is apparent to even the most 
indifferent. Bodily health can best be preserved by it, and the pleasure 
to be had from the exercise is hardly realized by the majority of people. 
The sense of power, the buoyant, exhilarating pleasure imparted by a 
long walk is not equaled by any other exercise. Next to it must be the 
freedom felt in flying, which we canuot wholly realize. But what flying 
must be to the bird, walking is to man. In it he expresses his strength 
and lordship over the earth; he alone treads the earth erect and firmly 
planted on his feet. He bounds along over the smooth turf enjoying 
the kind if not the degree of pleasure he would know if he could levitate 
himself and travel through the air. 

Walking is not to all an endurable exercise, for people with poor feet 
often find it a torture rather than otherwise. The smaller number of 
people have healthy feet, the majority suff'er from the presence of 
bunions and corns, which entirely destroy the comfort of their posses- 
sors. Feet should be hardened by use, free from disease and protected 
by roomy, well fitting shoes. We should all have more shoes than we 
keep on hand, and two or more changes in a day will keep the feet well. 
The care of the feet is of prime importance, and amateur walkers will 
do well to follow the advice of the well known pedestrian, Edward 
Payson Weston, in treating their feet for a long walk. He advised that 



Io8 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

a ba.th be taken in the morning of salt water and after properly drying 
the body, to bathe in whiskey or some other spirits. This is to be repeated 
in the evening after the walk. In walking the strain comes heaviest on 
the feet and they should be strengthened by the use of light and not too 
stiff shoes, which should be replaced after a walk by a pair or softer 
ones. The pavements of a city are not comfortable to exercise upon, 
for the reason that the stones do not give to the feet, and the effort 
used in walking reacts upon the muscles. Country woods are the places 
to walk, where the turf is soft and elastic, and the magnetism of the 
earth is constantly passing into the feet, and strengthening the whole 
body. Walking is the best of all exercises for making the body supple 
and its movements graceful. Haste in walking destroys its beneficial 
results, and graceful motion is thus wholly lost. One thing must never 
be forgotten in walking for exercise, and that is to choose localities where 
the objects will interest and where new scenes will entertain the mind. 
To go over the same road repeatedly is to tire of it, and if a pedestrian 
is bored by the familiarity of the surroundings walking will be rendered 
irksome. 



BATHING AND SWIMMING. 

How^ few ladies there are w^ho know how to bathe properly, and 
how lamentable is the fact that so vast a majority of women are ignorant 
of the art of swimming ! Yet the one is a valuable essential of a healthy 
condition of the system, and the other is of vital importance to every 
human being — man or boy, woman or girl — as a means of preserving 
life. With all the deference shown by woman to the behests of re- 
ligious rules, the one great law of the religious code, "cleanliness is 
akin to godliness," is sadly neglected by a large class of wealthy 
women. Not that they neglect their necessary ablutions in their 
bath-rooms, but that they are too much afraid of sea-shore or cold 
water bathing. Thanks, however, to the very great facilities which 
are now afforded at our metropolitan sea-shore resorts, such as Coney 
Island, Rockaway, Long Beach, the Hampton beaches on Long 
Island, and at Long Branch, Newport and other such noted watering- 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES. IO9 

places, sea-bathing • has become more frequent than it used to be, 
and with it has come a better condition of health among the women 
who have taken advantage of the facilities afforded them each sum- 
mer. We have frequently seen ladies in the water on the Coney- 
Island beach bathing places, however, who have by their neglect of 
the hygienic rules of bathing almost nullified the beneficial effects of 
their baths. For instance, how many are there of the lady bathers 
at our watering-places in the summer who ever strictly observe the 
following code of rules for healthy bathing ? 

First — Never take a cold bath directly after a hearty meal, as 
the drafts made upon the natural heat of the body by the sudden im- 
mersion in the cold water abruptly retard the process of digestion, 
even at times stopping it altogether. Going in to bathe, too, on an 
empty stomach is almost as trying to the digestive organs. An hour 
after a meal is the least time necessary for the stomach to be prepared 
for the loss of heat. 

Second — While it is not advisable to rush into cold water with a 
system overheated to any excess, it is less objectionable than to go 
into the water " cooled off," as too many do. It should be borne in 
mind that the system wants all its natural heat to bring about that 
reactionary circulation of the blood to the surface of the body, after it 
has been driven inwardly by the shock of the cold water. To cool 
off before bathing is to deprive yourself of the very means required to 
induce that healthy reaction, which is such an essential advantage of 
the bath. It used to be regarded as necessary to get " cooled off" 
before bathing, but that has been proved a dangerous fallacy. 

Third — Never remain in the water long enough to experience a 
chilly, shivering sensation, as it shows conclusively that you have 
lost too much of your natural heat. So long as you exercise in the 
water, either by swimming or by the romping and frolicking of the 
surf bather's custom, and thereby generate bodily heat as fast as it is 
absorbed by the water, your bath can be prolonged at will ; but to 
remain in until your lips are blue and your body is chilled to the 
marrow, as it were, is to nullify all the good efiectj of your bath. 



no THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Fourth — Avoid, when swimming, going far from the shore, if the 
temperature of the water is below the ordinary summer months' range, 
as it sometimes is, as one result will be liability to seizure by cramps, 
in which case your nether limbs become helpless. Cramps, too, al- 
most invariably follow going into the water when the stomach is not 
in condition to withstand the shock. 

Fifth — When you first go in the water, take a good douse of 
water, immersing your body entirely, and then come out and wait 
until the reaction sets in, then return and exercise in the water, not 
simply lay off and get cool in it. That is not bathing for the benefit 
of the bath. 

Sixth — Never go beyond the stated boundaries— if you are not a 
competent long-distance swimmer — unless there are safety-ropes or 
other safeguards on the shore. The best swimmers can be too ven- 
turesome. 

There are other bathing rules to be attended to by those who bathe 
for health alone, but the above will suffice for this work. 

How to learn to swim is not only an important subject for study 
and investigation, but " How am I to learn to swirn ? " is a question 
not very easy of answer, unless through the medium of a regular 
treatise on the art ; and yet to learn to swim may be said to be some- 
thing very easy of attainment under certain circumstances, among 
which may be named the possession of courage, determination and a 
measurable degree of what is known as " presence of mind," or, the 
nerve to think, the courage to act, and to act promptly on the sugges- 
tion of your sudden thought, on the occasion of a critical emergency. 
Animals which have never entered the water swim by instinct, the 
requisite motions of the limbs to sustain them in the water coming 
into play at once by natural influence. Why it is that it is not so in 
the case of mankind is simply because the controlling power of edu- 
cation too frequently mars the influence of instinct. The Indian 
boy at the Sandwich Islands needs no lessons in swimming. From 
the first entry of the child into the water the little one strikes out 
naturally, and manages to keep afloat, if nothing more, his progress to- 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES.' Ill 

ward perfect swimming being rapid. But our boys, and especially our 
girls, inheriting an educated dread of water, lose all confidence, become 
paralyzed with fear and muscularly helpless when suddenly thrown 
into deep water. Could they realize the fact, at such a time, that it 
is really more difficult to keep under the water than it is to float 
on its surface, they would then be in possession of that confidence 
which would allow natural instinct to have its way, and then to strike 
out and swim at once would be at their command. Confidence 
is everything in learning to swim. Indeed, the art is almost impos- 
sible of attainment without it. The point, therefore, in the very be- 
ginning is how to become inspired with the necessary confidence. 
We learned to swim in half an hour by obtaining a practical knowl- 
edge of how difficult it is to keep under water, after we had used up 
months in unavailing efforts with such ordinary aids to swimming, 
as floats, corks and rubber life-preservers. Standing in a bathing- 
house in water four feet deep, we tossed a pebble in, and, keeping 
our eyes open, dived under the water to pick it up. It looked quite 
easy, but no sooner was our body under the water than its tendency 
to float to the top kept us from reaching the pebble. Realizing this 
fact so clearly and palpably, and having become quite familiar with 
the movement of limbs necessary in swimming, we at once struck out 
in deeper water, and swam with ease the length of the bath, though 
previously we could not progress two yards without feeling the fear 
of sinking. 

The motion of the limbs in swimming is simply that of moving 
your arms and legs as propellers to push yourself forward through 
the water. However, no book rules will suffice to teach you to swim. 
Better watch a girl who can swim well, and then try to copy her 
movements. Remember this : If you think you are about to sink 
when in the water, keep as still as you can, paddle with your hands, 
and throw your head back ; but don't struggle wildly. Above all, do 
not go near deep water unless you can swim. Many a girl's life has 
been lost at watering-places by venturing out too far, and getting 
frightened when the water is near her arms in depth, 



112 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

The editor of the London Truth, after observing that probably not 
one in twenty of the persons who indulge in boating on a holiday 
can swim, proceeds to tell his readers how to acquire this accomplish- 
ment. " Nothing," he says, " is more easy. When the air is out of 
a body its owner sinks ; when the air is in the body its owner floats. 
Let any one slowly draw in his breath as he draws back his legs and 
pushes forward his arms, retain it while he is preparing for the stroke 
which is to propel him, and slowly allow it to go through his lips as 
his arms are passed back from before his head to his sides, and his 
legs are stretched out. The action of the stroke should not be quite 
horizontal, but should be made on a slight decline downward. The 
real reason why people take weeks to learn how to swim is because 
swimming professors either do not know, or do not choose to teach, 
the philosophy of breathing, so as to render the body buoyant." 

ROWING. 

Rowing a light boat on a stream, a lake, a mill-pond in the country, 
or on our city lakes at Central or Prospect Park, is a very pleasur- 
able and healthy exercise for girls, as it gives freedom of action to 
the much-neglected muscles of their arms and chest; but unless light 
oars are used the work is rather heavy for ladies. No girl ought to 
enter a boat alone for rowing exercise unless she knows how to swim. 
There are so many chances for accidents of one kind or another which 
involve risk of drowning that this rule ought to be generally ob- 
served by lady rowers. Of course, if you have a gentleman with you 
the case is different, or some one who can swim in case of emergency. 
Light boats, suitable for a girl to row about in, are easily upset, and 
they require careful handling. In learning to row you begin by using 
one oar at a time. Don't go to work at it in a hap-hazard way, 
but study the thing up, and first know what you have to do to pull 
an oar before you set about it. There is the action of dipping the 
oar properly; pulling it forward; lifting it out of the water dcadi push- 
ing it back again ready for the next dip — making four separate move- 
ments which require special attention to be given to each one — and 



SPORTS. AND GAMES FOR LADIES. I 1 3 

then you must attend to doing all four with harmonious action and in 
clock-work order. The dip, the pull, the lift and push back are the 
four distinct movements used in pulling an oar. You must avoid 
dipping your oar too deep in the water, going no deeper than to ob- 
tain a good hold on the water; in lifting it, too, you must avoid lift- 
ing it too high out of the water. In deep water let the flat part of the 
oar go under water, and in lifting let it skim the surface of the water 
a few inches only above it. In pulling your oar forward, do it with 
a steady stroke, not with a jerk, giving your full strength to the pull 
just as the oar reaches the centre of the stroke and its deepest im- 
mersion ; and when you push back your oar on its return out of water, 
do it with a quick but steady stroke. Begin slowly, and look well at 
each of your four movements : first at the dip, that your oar is not 
too deep in the water ; then at your forward pull, that your full 
strength be not exerted until your oar is well in the water ; then at 
your lift, that your oar may not rise more than three or four inches 
above the water, and lastly, at your return stroke, so that your oar 
may go back quickly and yet enter the water without a splash. After 
learning these four movements well, you will then have to learn how 
to " feather " your oar. You will have observed that in making your 
return stroke after hfting your oar from the water the flat por- 
tion of the oar acts as a surface facing the wind so as to retard your 
advance, especially if you are rowing against the wind. To obviate 
this and to present to the wind on the return stroke only the edge 
of the oar is what the process of feathering accomplishes, and this 
feathering is done by the motion of the wrists in turning the handle 
of the oar half round the moment you lift the oar from the water. 
The oar while in the water being in position No. i, is, when it is 



lifted, changed at once to position No. 2, the centre line of the dia- 
gram showing the vertical and horizontal position of the paddle of the 
oar. This feathering of the oar is not essential for the ordinary pur- 



XI4 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

poses of exercise, but it is the finishing stroke of the art, and gives 

strength to the muscles of the wrist. Of course, when you can do all 

this while using both hands to a single oar, you then learn to do 

exactly the same movements first with the right hand and then with 

th; left. When you can do this well, you then begin to row with the 

pair of oars, and if you have followed the above instructions carefully, 

you will be surprised to see how soon you can row with both oars, 

and row creditably, too. 

CHESS. 

The game of Chess is the king of in-door games, and the most 
scientific recreation a lady can engage in. It differs from every other 
game in vogue in that the element of chance is completely eliminated 
from it. In this fact, too, lies one of its greatest attractions, for a 
victory won at chess is a triumph due to your skill in out-manceu- 
vering your adversary by your superior play, and not by your possession 
of a full hand of trumps, as in cards, or by the lucky toss of the dice, 
as in backgammon. Ladies have a prevalent idea that to learn to 
play chess is an immensely difficult and fatiguing task ; whereas the 
fact is that there are few games the elementary rules of which are 
more easy of explanation, and not one which yields such an amount 
of gratification in the mastery of its rules as chess. A drawback to 
the general introduction of a knowledge of chess exists in the fact 
that nearly all the books of instruction on the game are written as if 
the authors regarded the game in the light of a mathematical study 
rather than a mental recreation. One effect of this course has been 
to frighten young students, especially ladies, at the very outset of 
their attempt to learn the game, by impressing them with the idea 
that quite an amount of laborious work is before them ere they 
can hope to become adepts at the game. Another characteristic of 
most books of instruction is the too great prominence given to the 
study of the various chess openings, as if a thorough knowledge of 
these would alone make one a first-class player. The study of open- 
ings, as well as the playing over of games by noted masters of the 
art, are well enough in their way ; but the utmost familiarity with the 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES. IIJ 

best openings extant, or with the style of play of the greatest of 
chess-masters, will not make you a chess-player unless you possess 
the mental aptitude and ability to excel in the game, and by means of 
which due effect is to be given your " book knowledge." This latter 
aid to chess is like the use of cork floats in learning to swim — they 
merely assist one to familiarize himself with certain movements prior 
to his entire dependence upon his own resources. The "book" 
player, in chess, goes on swimmingly while he is in the shallow water 
of his knowledge of the openings ; but the moment he goes beyond 
that depth, and has to depend upon his own mental powers for suc- 
cess, if he lacks the nerve, the control of temper and the strategic 
skill to outwit his wily adversary, all his " book-learning " goes for 
naught. 

An important element of chess study, after the learner has 
mastered the initiatory moves, and the various powers possessed by 
the six different pieces of the chess board — the king, queen, rooks, 
bishops, knights and pawns — is to acquire the art of chess analysis, 
which can only be attained by learning to calculate the effect of the 
various moves on the board without moving the pieces, just as is 
done in the effort to solve a problem by studying a printed diagram. 
Without this power of mental analysis book study is comparatively 
useless. The best way to learn this is to try and solve two move 
chess problems. 

To give special detailed instructions in chess would be beyond the 
scope of this work. We therefore only present a brief chapter of 
hints to beginners by way of an introduction to the study of some 
more elaborate work. We first present a diagram of the board, with 
the chessmen placed in their proper positions. 

It will be seen that the white men are before the first player, and 
that the board is placed so that a white square is in each right-hand 
corner of the board. We now come to the peculiar move of each of 
the six different pieces on the board. It will be understood that there 
are in all thirty-two pieces with which the game is played, sixteen of 
which are white men and sixteen black. Of each sixteen all but the

king and queen are duplicated ; the bishops, knights and rooks being 
in pairs— four of each on the board, two of each being white, and 
two black — while there are eight pawns of each color. But there 
are but six pieces in all, each of which has separate and distinct 
moves. Placing each of these pieces in the centre of the board 
with no other piece on it at the time, and it will be found that each 
has the following number of moves at command : Beginning with 
the king, as he moves but one square around his position, he com-

mands just eight squares. The queen moves as the king does, but 
v/ith the addition of no limit to the number of squares it can move 
to, thereby commanding twenty-seven squares. The bishop moves 
only diagonally, each bishop on its own squares, one for the white 
squares and one for the black, each commanding thirteen squares. 
Place the two bishops of the white men on the two central squares 
adjoining each other, and it will be seen at a glance how many 



SPORTS AND GAMES FOR LADIES. 11/ 

squares each commands by its diagonal movement. The rooks each 
command fourteen squares to, the right or the left, or forward or 
backward, but not diagonally. It will be seen that the move of the 
queen combines that of the king, rooks and bishops. The knight 
has a move peculiar to itself, and as it stands in the centre of the 
board commands eight squares. It is the only piece that, standing 
in its regular position with all the other pieces in their places, 
can be moved before a pawn is moved in the beginning of the game, 
one knight moving from black to white, and the other from white to 
black. A study of the moves of the pieces as above directed will 
rapidly familiarize the learner with the value of each piece. The 
pawns also have a different method of moving to that of the other 
pieces, and, by the way, the pawns are always known as " pawns," 
and the other pieces as " pieces." The pawn always moves forward, 
one square at a time, but it can only take by moving sideways. By 
learning this much of the game carefully, you will have progressed 
far enough to be able to begin to play with an experienced opponent.

jHE ideal home, like the ideal life, should aim at com- 
pleteness and perfection. I use the word " ideal " be- 
cause it exactly expresses a high mark to be aimed 
at, and I use the two words " completeness " and 
"perfection," the one to denote quantity and the 
other quality. The first reminds us that there must 
be enough — ^that is, neither deficiency nor superfluity ; the second, 
that what there is must be the best of its kind. 

In reality, perfect completeness and complete perfection are never 
attained by man either in his life or in his home. Physically, men- 
tally and morally man is an imperfect being. Even the strong man 
armed finds a stronger than himself Our vision is limited and 
imperfect, and both the physical and intellectual eye can see but a 
short distance, and are bounded by a narrow horizon beyond which 
there stretch circle after circle beyond our ken until they fade away 
in infinity. But an old historian makes this the great difference 
between man and brute, that while the brute looks always downward 
and earthward, man looks upward and beyond himself Yet we 
must never think that the eye in us is the centre of the universe, or 
forget that 

" There are more things in heaven and earth 
Than are dreamed of in our philosophy." 

Because we cannot attain completeness or perfection is no reason 
(ii8) 



THE LIBRARY IN tHE HOME. llQ 

why we should not aim at the best and highest. The mere ambition 
and endeavor carries us a long way up the mountain of progress. 
One of the greatest men who ever lived seemed to be wholly filled 
with this idea. He urged his fellow-men to aim at being perfect as 
God is perfect, although he was oppressed by the perpetual con- 
sciousness of his own and other's imperfection. St. Paul's mind was 
that of a spiritual and intellectual architect who aimed at making 
life a perfect building, fitly joined together in all its parts, each part 
in harmony with all the rest, and all blending upward into one sym- 
metric spire. The home should be the same, complete in its 
furniture, no bare walls or floors, no rubbish strewed around and 
every chamber informed by harmony, which is only another word 
for perfection. 

To approach toward this completeness and perfection, one of the 
first things needed is to know what is wanting, and should be added, 
as well as what is useless and should be thrown aside. A great 
heathen philosopher discoursing about friendship expresses his 
wonder that while the multitude of men are so eager to provide 
costly furniture, and elegant appendages to life, they neglect to 
provide themselves with sincere and faithful friends, whom he con- 
siders to be life's noblest furniture. 

Of course, in the making of our home, as in the making of our 
lives, there will always be something which we cannot complete. 
The finest architecture will have some imperfection or defect. We 
shall find the convex where the concave would be better; the 
rounded for the pointed, the inclined for the straight, the elliptical 
for the spherical. So must it ever be ; whether in life or in the home, 
so long as man is the builder. 

" The unfinished window in Aladdin's palace 

Unfinished must remain.'' 

This thought should stimulate and not dishearten us. Let us see 
what the defect is, and supply what is wanting if we can. The great 



120 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

thing wanting in most homes is not more chairs and tables, but 
books, and not so much more books as better ones. 

There is a new method of ministering to minds diseased, and 
alleviating melancholy and other disturbed conditions of the nerves 
and brain, which is very simple, and is said to have done good to 
many who have tried it. It is called the color cure, and merely con- 
sists in selecting for wall-paper, window panes, furniture or carpets, 
curtains and drapery, those colors that relieve the eye, and acting 
through the sight upon the mind produce a diversion of feeling and 
give another current to the thoughts. Every one has been conscious 
of the relief which beautiful flowers, both by their colors and their 
perfume, afford, when one is suffering with headache or what is 
known as " the blues." They have the same effect upon us through 
the eye as a strain of exquisite music has upon us through the ear. 
A single rose has often gladdened a whole room, and brought pleas- 
ant thoughts and feelings to the invalid in mind or body. Beautiful 
books can do the same, and with more permanent effect. Not by 
the rich binding, the fine paper, the clear type, the pretty pictures — 
although all these are pleasant to the taste, and good food for the 
imagination and the fancy — but chiefly by the precious jewels of 
truth and light, of memory and hope, of beauty and sweetness that 
lie within the casket of the leaves and binding. 

Of completeness and perfection, size or bulk is not the test or the 
condition. A large and showy book may not be worth reading, while 
a small and unpretending one may be a pearl of great price to the 
reader's mind. " Handsome is that handsome does,'' is true of books 
as well as men. A showy person, however faultless his exterior, may 
be a fool, and some little people are the greatest of men and the 
most agreeable of companions. The beauty of a house does not 
depend upon its size. It may be very defective, although very large; 
and have completeness and perfection, although merely a cottage. 
"A man's life," said One who knew what was in man, " does not 
consist of the abundance of the things that he possesses, for the life is 
more than meat, and the body than raiment." Neither do the com- 



THE LIBRARY IN THE HOME. 121 

pleteness and perfection of a man's life depend upon the length of it. 
A short day may see great deeds done, and a long day may be full 
of emptiness. Some men and women have accomplished their life- 
work at thirty, while others who live to be a hundred have never done 
anything at all. One man has been a benefactor to his race while 
yet a youth, and has retired to rest early because his work was done. 
Another may go on living, if that can be called living which is 
merely eating, drinking and sleeping, until all his companions have 
departed and all whom he has conversed with have fallen asleep, 
and nothing of him be noted or have ever been observed, except that 
he was a creeping thing made up of coat, and hat and cane. 

" Little and good " is better than big and useless. Nimble Jack 
was too much for the giant Blunderbore. The ants do more than 
the tortoises. Old Parr, who died of too much cakes and ale at 
Charles the Second's court, was a mere boy when he died because, in 
a century and a half, he had not learned as much, or done as much, 
or tried to do as much, as many a village lad who marvelled at him 
and why he went on living when all other folks died decently. 

Plato taught men centuries ago that it is far better to learn a little 
well than a great deal confusedly. Smattering is bad both in life 
and reading. Many a centenarian has only smattered through life, 
and does not know much about it when his book of life is shut for- 
ever. The same is true of indiscriminate and desultory readers. 
They remind one of those who have no ear for music, but think it 
must be fine in proportion to the loudness of the noise it makes. 
The still small voice is inaudible to them ; they want thunder from 
plenty of big drums. Some people's taste in books is like that of 
the New York gamins in plays ; they must have plenty of blood for 
their money, and the play to suit them must be " full of sound and 
fury, signifying nothing." 

There are certain marks and signs by which one may know the 
mental habits of others, just as a man's good breeding or the reverse 
may be manifested in little things. Good old Launcelot Andrews, 
Bishop of Winchester, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, used to be

very much annoyed by idle visitors who disturbed him while he was 
studying in his library of a morning. " Methink," said he, " that 
they be no true scholars who call upon man before noon." In the 
same way, we may set down a few of the tokens by which the sham 
thinker and shallow reader may be known. 

There are persons — their name is legion — who borrow books as 
they do umbrellas, without the remotest intention of ever returning 
them. This is bad enough, but it is almost as bad to deface, "dog's- 
ear," or tear a book before returning it. Some valuable books when 
they come back to their too kindly owner present the appearance of 
having been used as a portable dinner-table, the once unsullied pages 
wearing the aspect of a greasy table-cloth. This is vulgar and in- 
decent, but even worse than this is it to find one's book desecrated 
by the idiotic remarks and egotistic emendations of the conceited 
coxcomb, or, let us charitably hope, silly lunatic, to whom in a 
moment of amiable weakness we lent the cherished volume which 
had solaced many a lonely and enlivened many a leisure hour. The 
shock is almost as great as if we saw again the face of a dear 
friend besmeared with mud by some miserable urchin of the gutter. 
Nothing has ever made a rational being regret his ability to read so 
much as the perusal of these inane, asinine comments and presumed 
improvements on some favorite author, written on the margin. 
Show us the girl who cannot admire a sentence or a sentiment with- 
out scrawling " very true '' or " how beautiful " beside it, and we will 
show you a girl whom the sensible young men of her neighborhood 
will do well to avoid. No rational man would make love or offer 
marriage to one of these feminine annotators. She would write her 
impressions on his shirt front and make remarks upon his cuffs. The 
note-taker, the annotator, the commentator, the critic are of course 
inevitable everywhere, and are well enough in their place. 

" A chiel's amang ye takin' notes, 
And, faith, he'll prent it ; " 

but that will be in his own book; he will not pencil it in ours. It is 



THE LIBRARY IN THE HOME. 123 

not fair to lay all the blame upon school-girls and maidens, how- 
ever, in this matter. The youth whose imagination is "sicklied o'er " 
with his own conceit does it as often as the skin-deep female annotator. 
He obtrudes his cant, his bigotry, his feeble unreason and even his 
bad spelling and vile grammar upon all who have the misfortune 
to become his victims by reading hereafter the page upon which 
he has left his impress. To deface a man's book in this way should 
be a felony by law ; it is like the trick of some dishonest jewellers 
who extract the genuine and insert a bogus stone into the ring they 
profess to repair. Save us from this literary repairing of our books, 
say we. Not only does it destroy the value of the work as private 
property, but when perpetrated as it constantly is upon the volumes 
of a public or circulating library, it diffuses an intellectual small-pox 
and marks with varioloid all the reading of a neighborhood. Un- 
happily, these self-inflated scribblers conceal their names, or the public 
intelligence which they have outraged might deface and make mar- 
ginal notes upon the fleshly tablets of their own " calf" 

These strictures, of course, do not apply to those real note-takers 
who study what they fead, and make references in books that belong 
to themselves. The interleaved plan is an excellent one, when some 
ancient or modern standard author whom one has often to refer to is 
being studied, especially when comparison with other authorities 
upon the same subject is necessary. This, of course, involyes the 
unbinding and rebinding of the book, with alternate blank pages for 
annotation, but where that is too expensive a process, the separate 
note-book may be made as useful, if intelligently indexed and ar- 
ranged. 

Having decided that our home is incomplete and imperfect without 
a library, the next step is to set about providing one. And here the 
principle of a little, thoroughly, rather than a great deal superficially, 
should guide us. Wealthy people who give a wholesale order for a 
library all at once, never read, and often do not know the names of 
the books they buy. Hence it is, that famous and costly libraries 
pass by public auction from one wealthy owner to another, each new 



124 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

possessor reading the precious volumes as mucii as the last one, 
which is not at all. Indeed, the books might as well be dummies, 
for the backs of the bindings and the titles are all that are looked at. 
It is better to begin with a small selection of books, and add to them 
as we need more. As Milton said that, " Words are the fool's 
counters but the wise man's money," so books should be used for 
their real value to the mind. For the Home Library I do not think 
that sufficient value is set upon works of imagination. Family read- 
ing ought not to be too dry and serious, or made too much like the 
severe training of professional and academical study. The vast 
majority of readers have to work for their daily bread, and need 
relaxation and amusement in their leisure hours. A game of chess 
is a better mathematical exercise for them than the propositions of 
Euclid. Popularized science, however, where the text-books are 
written by the best masters, may be quite as interesting, and more 
instructive than most works of imagination. Theology and moral 
philosophy, not less than social science, may be made delightful. 

But as general culture should precede special knowledge, it is best 
to humanize the family circle before making it scientific. And this 
humane culture comes from the good story and the beautiful poem 
more than from the learned treatise or the didactic discourse. The 
works of Charles Dickens have had an immense influence upon 
English-speaking humanity, but they have helped to change the 
very conditions of life they described, and for that reason are no 
longer as much read by the young as formerly. The same may be 
said of the more exclusive and select circles that Thackeray satirized. 
The " Vanity Fair " we mix in nowadays is not one of rakes and 
marquises, of fashionable clubs and classical old schoolfellows. The 
virtues and vices of humanity are the same always and everywhere, 
but we have to take them out of one frame and put them into an- 
other to suit the times. Major Pendennis and Colonel Newcome are 
passed away, and their qualities are dressed in other uniforms. 
Hence, the story-writers who take life on a large scale, and make 
their stories less dependent upon the accidents of birth and place. 



THE LIBRARY IN THE HOME. 125 

last longer and are less ephemeral. Such are George MacDonald, 
Charlotte Bronte, and the supreme George Eliot. The last-named, 
especially, merely used the novel as a setting or frame for her pic- 
tures of the truth. 

It would be very difficult and of little use to suggest a list of books 
for the library at home. Not only would the size of the library have 
to be considered in relation to the means and social condition of 
the particular family, but the previous education, tastes, capacities, 
and idiosyncrasies of every member of the family, would have to be 
taken into account. I have met persons of good intelligence who 
worshipped Carlyle, and others who could not endure him. All 
authors who write in a singular or affected style create repugnance 
in some, to whom their ideas would be acceptable in another dress. 
This is why Washington Irving and Hawthorne are so universally 
beloved in every household. Their style has no affectations ; it is 
as natural as their stories. 

Ours is pre-eminently the age of story-reading and of story-writ- 
ing. It is rare to find a novel nowadays which has not some merit; 
but since, amid such abundance, one cannot possibly read all, it is 
best to keep to the great masters whose works have borne the tests 
of criticism and of time. Life is too short to read every new novel 
to find what there is of nourishment, pleasure, and mental profit in it. 
It is best to be guided by those who have read the book and recom- 
mended it. Hence Emerson said that he never read a book until it 
was twenty years old. Sir Walter Scott's novels are wholesome 
reading. More recent novelists too often write down to the frivoli- 
ties of their own time, instead of up to the humanity of all time. 
And of books that inspire us with power, and are not merely a re- 
source for killing time, it may be said that, " no one who has tasted 
old wine straightway desireth new, for he saith the old is better." 

In the judgment of Archbishop Trench, the greatest master of the 
English language among modern authors was Thomas DeQuincey; 
and in the judgment of Anthony Trollope, the greatest novel in the 
English language is Thackeray's " Henry Esmond." Mr. Trollope's 



126 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

own novels are very widely read, both in America and in England ; 
many persons of good taste are enthusiastic about " Orley Farm," 
and " Barchester Towers." Yet there are people of good taste 
who confess that they never felt power or stimulus from any of 
Trollope's novels. 

The ground one treads upon when offering advice to others as to 
the selection of a home library is so crowded that no matter what 
selection may be made, others will suggest a better and others a 
better still. The guiding principle of all readers should be to read 
such books as give them power, not such as weaken them. The 
analogy of the body and food holds good of the mind and reading. 
There are some foods that make bone and others that make flesh. 
A child fed on nothing but candies would soon die. Doctors tell 
us that only two foods contain every possible element of nutrition 
which every part of the human system requires. These are milk 
and eggs. These foods assimilate quickly and are easily digested ; 
milk the more so, as the glutinous substance in eggs takes longer. If 
any one had to choose two books that should do most for all his 
moral and mental constitution, and should ask me, " Where are the 
milk and eggs for the mind ? " I should answer at once, " The Bible 
and Shakspeare." That is not saying that all parts of these two 
volumes are equally valuable, or denying that some parts are not the 
most wholesome brain food. All milk is not equally good, and the 
shells of eggs are not eaten. I mean only that within the covers of 
the Bible and within the covers of Shakspeare there is the finest food 
for heart and life that has ever yet come into the human market. A 
home library, therefore, would be incomplete and imperfect without 
these two master-pieces of experience, humanity, philosophy, and 
poetry. 

The mention of poetry reminds us that it must be ranked with the 
story as an educator of the imagination. Some persons do not care 
for poetry, others like one poet and dislike another. There are many 
who care nothing for any of the fine arts, whether the eye or the ear 
is appealed to, The reason of this is that imagination is by no means 



THE LIBRARY IN ,THE HOME. 



127 



a universal quality, and that a vast number of human beings are 
esthetically blind and deaf. Yet it is not possible to overrate the 
influence of the imagination upon every phase of human Hfe. It has 
founded empires and destroyed them ; it has built cities, temples and 
palaces, and laid them waste; it has given impetus to commerce, 
and discovered continents. A quick, vivid and reason-tempered 
imagination is the most powerful weapon for success in life. A 
warped, perverted, feeble, irresolute imagination will never get from 
the shadow to the substance. Hence, so many lives are spent in 
dreaming and nothing else. That only is true imagination which 
sets the will in motion and leads to definite results. 

Poetry comes in as proper food for this divine gift and wonderful 
faculty within us. It is foolish to be always asking others such ques- 
tions as who is their favorite poet, and whether they think this poet 
better than the other. Every one has his own taste in literature as in 
all else, and especially in poetry. Too much even of wholesome food 
is bad ; we ought to digest thoroughly whatever we eat. Indiscrim- 
inate reading leads to mental dyspepsia, but a moderate meal of 
stimulating food gives lustre to the eye and energy to the mind. 
After Shakspeare, the poets I should next think of placing in my 
little library would be Wordsworth, Byron, Scott, Tennyson, Mrs. 
Browning and Longfellow, Bryant and Whittier. Others would be 
sent for when we had more room. 

This training of the imagination before the life and character are 
formed is, perhaps, the most solemn responsibility that can devolve 
upon parents and teachers. If once the youthful imagination is made 
familiar with gross and sensual thoughts, the heavenly dew of purity 
is brushed rudely off it. " Can a man touch pitch and be undefiled?" 
Hence, the deadly poison of much of the cheap sensational fiction 
and debased journalism of the time. Let us fill our children's minds 
with angels, lest devils enter in and dwell there. 

To write well for children, as to be a good oral teacher of children, 
the author must have the child's feelings fresh in himself, through the 
power of sympathy and imagination. Charles Kingsley once went

out to rebuke some boys who were trespassing upon his grounds 
and jumping over his fences ; but so boyhke was his heart, that he 
no sooner caught sight of their happy faces than he forgot his wrath 
and joined their frohc. It is this youthful spirit of sympathy that 
makes many of his books such healthy reading for boys and girls. 
He is always true to a high standard of honor, fidelity and manhood. 
It seems to me that there is no better way of guiding one's own or 
others' children in the choice of books, than to look back upon our 
own childhood, and trace the mental influences that formed our own 
mind and character. If that does not show us what to choose, it 
often shows us what to avoid. Wherever we see that a book, what- 
ever its literary merits, did us harm, we should be careful not to put 
it in the way of others. In looking back to our childhood, how often 
can we distinctly see the ill effects of the first book that shook our 
faith in religion or humanity! It set our minds doubting instead of 
doing, and threw a haze of uncertainty upon the duties and hopes of 
life at the very start. It might not have been so ten years later, but 
destructive theories suddenly introduced to a wondering but trusting 
and yearning mind have a disastrous effect upon the mental and 
moral energies. To please God we must believe that he is, says 
St. Paul, and the infidel writer who tells us he is not, shakes our 
trust in him, and wish to please him. Beside this, early scepticism 
engenders the habit of universal scepticism, for which there is seldom 
any cure on this side of the grave. Let us build up principles in the 
minds of the young, not wantonly tear them down. I have no 
yearning for the Inquisition, or the Roman " Index Expurgatorius," 
but, so far as happiness and singleness of heart in childhood arc 
concerned, I wish that the books of Robert Taylor and Tom Paine 
had been burned. Terrible to many even now is the memory of the 
double thinking at church, the secret misgivings when the Bible was 
read to them, the sleepless nights, in which all that their parents held 
sacred and true seemed as the baseless fabric of a vision. Next to 
instilling doubt, however, in mischievous effects, is the cramming 
children's minds with superstition. The reaction is sure to come. 



THE LIBRARY IN THE HOME. 129 

They will first believe the fables taught them ; then disbelieve the 
truth, because they had been once deceived. From believing too 
much, they will believe too little, and often nothing at all. 

Too many feel with a sharp sense of pain what the destructive in- 
fluences in their childhood were. Let them try to recall the construc- 
tive, strengthening and confirming ones. The sentiment of pity grew 
apace within them, as they studied the healing deeds of Christ, and 
they found religious reflection much stirred by his parables. Next 
to these, perhaps, John Bunyan's " Pilgrim's Progress," and other 
sacred allegories to a less degree had the most to do with serious 
religious feeling and imagination. Religious allegaries are good 
reading in proportion as they are true to man's real experience of the 
conflict of good and evil within him. The " Pilgrim'i Progress'' is a 
true parable of life. 

In secular literature appealing to the imagination, the poetry that 
made them grow most was, first, that which reflected their own heart 
and taught them to look within ; and, secondly, that which drew 
the imagination out into a world of light of beauty by bringing 
nature home to them, and impressing its wonders and beauties on 
the mind. Wordsworth, especially his " Excursion," had a great 
progressive effect upon early thinking and feeling. 

For young people I do not like Milton because he is too deep and 
classical, and the military. parade and speech-making of the Satanic 
conspirators have no attraction for them. But when they grow old 
enough to separate the kernel from the shell, they find a sense of sub- 
limity in Milton, which is to be found in but one or two other poets. 

In poetry we find the truest and most perfect pictures of humanity 
in action, yet my own mind never felt an enthusiasm such as many 
do for epic or narrative poems. The poetry I loved best as a child 
was that of the affections rather than that of the battle-field. I would 
rather read of the battle of Hastings in a good history of England, 
than in Tennyson's " Harold," and of the martyrs of Queen Mary's 
reign in Blunt's " Sketch of the Reformation in England," than in 
Tennyson's " Queen Mary." For the same indefinable reason I have 





130 THE hearthstone; or, life at HOME; 

never been fond of dramatized history. I like best a play that 
relies upon imagination for its facts, these facts being true to human 
nature and experience, outgrowths of the imagination which is based 
on truth, rather than of the fancy which is not so derived. Of all 
the definitions of poetry which I have met with, that of Words- 
worth will best bear repetition and looking into earnestly. " Poetry 
is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge, the impassioned 
expression which is in the countenance of all science." The body 
of knowledge and of science is not necessary to our appreciation of 
this spirit and admiration of this countenance. Hence, poetry is a 
great help and stimulus in the patient pursuit of knowledge. 

Next to romance and poetry come history and biography. 
History is not the learning by repetition of dates, places and names. 
We must look for laws and principles in it, and hence a complete 
view of it is called the philosophy of history, because in widely 
distant ages, peoples and lands we find that like causes produce like 
effects. To be a real student of history is to view all things in the 
light of law, to have the mind well furnished with parallels and 
similitudes, with principles and cautions. There are two ways of 
reading history. One may begin with the general and work down 
to the particular, or one may begin with a centre and work to the 
outer circumference. The last mentioned is the best plan for general 
readers. Let us begin with our own race and country, and from 
them extend the circle of our reading to other countries, ancient and 
modern. Some teachers would tell us to read modern history before 
we read ancient, and perhaps that is the better method when our 
time is limited by active pursuits and bread-making. But, on the 
other hand, modern history, especially in its politics and institutions, 
is much easier to learn and understand, when we know the history 
of Greece and Rome in their main outlines and chief events and 
persons. 

History, in its best aspect, is but diffused biography, because it is 
man that has made events, not events that have made man. Biography, 
on the other hand, is history condensed and incarnated in a repre- 



THE LIBRARY IN THE HOME. 13! 

sentative maker of it. No reading is more healthy than that of 
first-class biography. " What man has done, man can do," says the 
proverb, and biography best teaches us what man has done. Long- 
fellow puts this truly in very simple verse : 

" Lives of great men all remind us 
We can make our lives sublime ; 
And departing leave behind us 
Footprints in the sands of time." 

But as " they also serve who only stand and wait," so it is not 
necessary to go to the wars in order to do service as a good soldier 
in the battle of life. Every human being has some influence upon 
others, and in using this influence for good we write a good 
biography of ourselves. 

In selecting works of biography for a home library the names of 
Washington, Franklin and others connected with the rise of liic 
Republic will occur to every one. Of the life of Shakspeare very 
little is known, but we should know that little. Milton's life is one 
of the most instructive. One should read it in connection with that 
of Oliver Cromwell, whose Secretary Milton was, and with the ' 
history of Charles the First, the Commonwealth and the Restoration. 
To know a man we must know his surroundings, and the times in 
which he lived. Boswell's " Life of Johnson " will never be out of 
date for family reading. It can be laid down and taken up without 
a break in the interest. And this reminds us that Dr. Johnson had 
that intuitive power which only few possess of getting the cream of 
a book by instant apprehension and attention. Some people may 
read a book through and then know very little about it, while others 
understand and comprehend its meaning and merits at a glance. 
Some books are good to dip into, but not to spend many hours upon. 
Others should be referred to again and again, and read through more 
than once. A good biographical encyclopaedia brought down to our 
own time should be in every home library. When we hear or read 
of some great act or work achieved in art or science we wish at once 
to know who the man was and what stock he came from. 



132 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

One of the most delightful kinds of family reading is that of such 
essays as can be read aloud, chatted about and finished at a sitting. 
Macaulay's are too long and critical for this ; they must be studied 
alone. But William Hazlitt, Emerson, and Boyd, and even Froude's 
" Short Studies on Great Subjects," are good company for 
social evening reading. It is not easy to recommend special 
books in biography or essays, without a personal knowledge 
of the character, tastes and ambition of those who need such 
guidance. Sex as well as age has to be considered, for while the 
majority of good books are suited to both sexes alike, boys and 
girls have each a special literature of their own. Both will de- 
light and find profit in the lives of those who have overcome diffi- 
culties, attained their object by perseverance and self-denial, and 
been a blessing to others. But the boy will naturally have a heroic, 
the girl a domestic taste. A little incident will illustrate the diffi- 
culty of selecting books for others. A young friend of ours desiring 
to make a birthday present to another of a useful book, did not know 
what to choose. By accident- his eye fell upon a sentence in one of 
Bulwer Lytton's novels which ran thus : " Whoever you are, and 
whatever your condition in life, read the ' Life of Robert Hall.' " 
Here the question seemed settled for him, and he lost no time in 
making the purchase. Some time afterward he asked his friend how 
he liked the book, for he himself had not read it. The answer was 
that Robert Hall was a great preacher and a good man, who must 
have suffered much in mind and body, but he did not see that his 
life was more interesting than the lives of other good men. Then 
our friend read the book himself, and sought eagerly for any special 
reason why the great novel writer had urged every one to read the 
" Life of Robert Hall " as more instructive and valuable than other 
good lives. Robert Hall had been subject to spells of insanity, but so 
had Cowper, and Collins, and Swift, and many other great minds. 
He had suffered much also from bodily pain, but there were numbers 
of greater men who had suffered more. He wondered why Lord 
Lytton had selected and commended it above all others, and he 



THE LIBRARY IN THE HOME. 13^3 

resolved to judge for himself before choosing for another in 
future. 

As lives that should be read by every one, those of Columbus, Sir 
Walter Raleigh, Sir Isaac Newton, Nelson, Wellington, Napoleon, 
Michael Angelo and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, occur readily 
in addition to those already referred to. The lives of Raleigh 
and Michael Angelo are conspicuous beyond all others for the 
versatility of powers they exhibit ; that of Newton for patience in 
study and discovery ; that of Charles the Twelfth for an indomitable 
will-power never exceeded and perhaps hardly equalled. Beside the 
great commanders on sea and land whom I have named, the heroes of 
the reign of Elizabeth, who made Great Britain the mistress of the 
seas, ought to fix the attention in reading the history of England. 
Charles Dickens' " Child's History of England " is good to start with 
in the nursery. Hume will come bye-and-bye, and after that the 
imagination and the memory will find the volumes of Macaulay and 
Froude more interesting than romance. 

It is well in the library at home to have some favorite representative 
of every art, science and profession, although we must not carry 
our hero-worship too far or be too exclusive in the choice of our 
representative men. Carlyle and Emerson have both chosen for 
their readers, but every one can make a selection of his own. In 
music, painting, sculpture, poetry, history, we may choose our own 
favorites as we come to know, them. Gibbon preferred Livy to any 
other Latin historian, and Addison preferred Virgil to any other 
Latin poet, Addison himself ought not to be neglected as one of 
the greatest masters of gentle humor and delicate satire in the 
English language. His papers in the " Spectator " are delightful as 
well as instructive. 

For boys, it is not necessary to recommend " Robinson Crusoe," 
the "Arabian Nights " or " Don Quixote." They are sure to find their 
way into every home library. 

In reading history, it is well to pause now and then, and reflect 
upon the different course it must have taken if this or that event had 



1 34 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

not happened. If Hannibal had besieged and taken Rome after the 
battle of Cannae : if Harold instead of William of Normandy had 
won at Hastings ; if the Prussians under Blucher had not arrived at 
Waterloo ; if King James and all his Parliament had been blown 
to pieces, and the Gunpowder Plot had not been discovered by that 
mysterious letter ; if Queen Victoria had been shot like Presidents 
Lincoln and Garfield ; these and a hundred similar questions will 
occur as we read, and give exercise as well as pleasure to the imagi- 
nation and reasoning powers. In reading biography it is well to 
reflect upon the different kinds of greatness and success, the various 
qualities, and the several paths of human enterprise. Samuel 
Rogers, the poet and banker of London, said he would have given 
half he was worth to have been the author of that exquisite farewell 
to life, by Mrs. Barbauld, which ends with — 

" Say not Good-night, but in some brighter clime 
Bid me Good-morning; " 

and General Wolfe, as he was approaching his heroic death upon 
the Heights of Abraham, declared that he would rather have been 
the author of Gray's Elegy than have taken Quebec. There are 
diversities of gifts, as we have been told, and one star differs from 
another star in glory. 

In reading, as in life, it is good for us to have some special line 
and inclination. Our general reading and the gradual insight we 
gain of our own mind and character will help us to choose aright both 
our work in life and our particular studies. But whatever our des- 
tined path may be, the lives of great men in all callings will be help- 
ful to us. Such a life as that of Thomas Edwards, the Scottish 
naturalist, is a monument of final perseverance and triumph over 
adverse circumstances, such as should nerve and brace every earnest 
reader of it to do with all his might whatever he finds to do. 

As a last piece of advice, let the young reader avail himself rever- 
ently and earnestly of the results arrived at by others. You have 
neither time nor learning to pick out groups of words out of the 



THE LIBRARY IN THE HOME. I35 

dictionary, and trace their history and meaning for yourself. But 
you have time to study Trench on " The Study of Words," a httle 
book, but brimful of useful knowledge and suggestive thoughts. 
You cannot search out and apply the proverbs of different countries, 
or even of your own English-speaking race, for yourself, but you 
can take the hand of the same great teacher as he leads you through 
" The Lessons Contained in Proverbs," a book which you can carry 
about you in your pocket like that on " Words." Wilmot's " Pleasures 
of Literature " and " Summer in the Country " are little books equally 
portable, but each contains a treasury of guidance in reading and 
illustration from nature, and its best interpreters. Read and cherish 
the little books as you would a photograph of a wondrous pan- 
orama, or the miniature of a dear friend. Help's " Companions of 
my Solitude," Boyd's "Recreations of a Country Parson," Emerson's 
" Society and Solitude," Thackeray's " Roundabout Papers," and 
Washington Irving's charming "Alhambra " are all good for family 
and fireside reading. The recent pocket classics, like " English Men of 
Letters," edited by John Morley, the " Ancient Classics for English 
Readers," edited by the Rev. W. Lucas Collins, and the works of 
Professor J. R. Green, of Oxford, in history, are all excellent and of 
convenient size. For poetry, the last edition of Bryant's " Library 
of Poetry and Song " is of great value from the extent of its selec- 
tions, the biographical dates of the several poets, and its admirable 
indexes which enable one to find what we want, either by author's 
name, or subject, or first line. In natural history you may have a 
rich feast for very little cost. That ever-charming work, Gilbert 
White's " Natural History of Selborne," Stanley's " History of 
British Birds," Audubon's " Quadrupeds of America " and " Birds of 
America," Mrs. Agassiz' " First Lessons in Natural History," " Wake 
Robin," by Burroughs, " Child's Book of Nature," by W. Hooker, 
" Our Feathered Friends," and " Houses without Hands " and " Nat- 
ural History," by Rev. J. G. Wood, Charles Kingsley's " Glaucus," 
" Seaside Studies in Natural History," by E. C. and A. Agassiz, 
form a splendid array, and you may add Buckland's " Curiosities 



13^ THE hearthstone; or, life AT HOME. 

of Natural History " and Hamerton's " Chapters on Animals " if 
you will. 

But in all your reading, remember that you do not live to read 
but read to live. Sow that you may reap ; seek that you may find, 
learn that you may teach, and amid all your learning and knowl- 
edge, learn to " know thyself" 




CHOICE OF OCCUPATION, 

"As garment draws the garment's hem, 
Men their fortunes bring with them ; 
By right or wrong 

Land and goods. go to the strong." 

VERYBODY, whether rich or poor, must do something 
with his time in this world, and those who do not have 
to work for a hving, really have a harder time of it 
than those who do. Doing nothing is very hard 
work, because it has to " kill time," as the saying is, 
and time is the hardest creature possible to kill; just when we think 
we have killed it, the poor old thing comes to life again and 
stares the idle man or woman in the face and says : " Now what 
are you going to do with me ? " If we wanted to punish any one 
with great, severity, there is no work which could be set him which 
would be more tiresome than to do nothing. Only imagine a person 
being tried in a court of law for doing wrong, and the learned judge, 
after the jury has brought in a verdict of guilty, sentencing him to 
do nothing for the rest of his life, or for a certain length of time. It 
would be worse than a sentence of death, because while we live our 
minds and bodies demand employment. One might as well bind a 
man with fetters as forbid him to use his hands and feet. It would 
be dreadful to have to sit twirling one's thumbs and doing nothing, 
even for a single day. • The eyes would be sure to fall on something 
which the mind would ask the hands to lay hold of or the feet to 
walk to. The thoughts would be sure to keep on saying : " I ought 
to be doing this or that ; to-morrow will be too late." 

Some people think that men and women only work because they 

('37) 



138 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

are driven to it, and that if bread and butter grew upon the trees 
and fell into their mouths without any trouble, they would stop 
working altogether. This is not so. Happily, it is not possible for 
any one but a lunatic or an imbecile to be utterly idle in this world, 
and perhaps even they have some employment in their efforts to 
think clearly which others do not notice. But if a man or woman 
is a rational and healthy bemg, he or she must keep doing something 
or other all the time, until they grow too old to do anything else 
than sleep, and dream about the past and get ready to die. The 
effect of continued idleness is severely felt in mind and body, and is 
noticed by every one around us. " The sleep of the laboring man 
is sweet,'' said the wise writer of the Book of Ecclesiastes, but the 
man who does no hard work during the day can enjoy no refreshing 
sleep at night. He has no weariness to recover from, and therefore 
needs no rest. On the contrary, nature will take her just revenge 
upon him for breaking the laws of health and happiness. If you 
have not walked or used your feet all day, they cannot be tired at 
night, except with the dreadfully tired feeling of laziness. If your 
hands have done nothing, they do not need a rest. If your brain has 
been listless and idle all day, then nature will wind it up at night 
like a clock, and it will keep on ticking and striking the hours, and 
beating the minutes in your ear, so that you cannot get a wink of 
sleep, and are glad when daylight comes so that you may turn out 
of bed instead of in it. 

Many men and women — thousands and millions of them — are 
over-worked and need more rest than they can get. Some of them 
break down, and are killed by over-work. Hundreds of factory 
hands and store girls in every large city die before they have reached 
their prime of life, because the strain of work is too great for their 
strength, and they are not able to bear it. Such cases are very sad, 
and every year fresh efforts are being made by kind and feeling 
masters — for there are some such in the world, though not too many — 
to lighten the burden by lessening the hours of labor. 

But while those who are over-worked are to be pitied, those wlio 



CHOICE OF OCCUPATION. 1 39 

have no work at all are more unhappy still. It is better to die of 
work than to live in idleness, and let the powers of mind and body 
wear away for want of using. Many persons go crazy or so eccentric 
as to be thought crazy for want of employment. They " don't know 
what to do with themselves," as they say, and the world does not know 
what to do with them. They bore themselves and everybody that 
comes near them. As they do nothing, so they think about nothing, 
and as they think about nothing of course their talk is all about 
nothing. The man or woman who works has a bright, intelligent look 
in the eyes, even if they are sometimes weary and anxious. They 
feel an interest in life because they bear their share in its burdens. 
If they fall in the hard battle of life, they fall nobly, like brave 
soldiers. They have fought a good fight in toiling patiently day by 
day to win bread for their children or their parents as well as for 
themselves. The working man is sometimes God's nobleman, higher 
in true rank than the man who is rolling in luxury and wealth. 

It does not always follow, however, that because a man is not 
working he is not willing to work. When the supply of labor is 
greater than the demand, there must always be some who at times 
are unemployed. But a great many of those who are thus often out 
of work are left behind, not because there is no work to be had, but 
because others are more skilful and therefore get ahead of them. 
Every man should aim at the highest excellence in his work, but in 
order to attain this, one must have ambition to excel and a real 
interest in and liking for one's work. The choice of one's occupation, 
business, trade or profession is therefore one of the most important 
acts of a man's life. Next to choosing a good wife is choosing a 
good business, and the two choices are intimately connected with 
each other. If a man chooses a business for which he is unfitted he 
will be a failure, not a success in it. And if he fail in his work how 
can he make a home for a wife, and what first-rate woman will listen 
to his proposal ? She will reason — for women sometimes do reason, 
whatever some men may say to the contrary — that a man who is a 
poor workman will be a poor home-builder and husband. Women 



140 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

worth winning like the man who never lags behind, but goes straight 
ahead in life by honesty, good conduct and skill in his work. " Pity is 
akin to love," they s-ay, but it is asking too much to expect a woman 
to take pity on a man who cannot take heed of himself, much less of 
a family. Take heed, then, how you choose your occupation; and when 
you have chosen it, devote all your energies to make yourself a 
master of it. 

Many influences, however, beside his own free choice determine a 
man's occupation in life. Parents exercise a great influence in this 
matter. Some fathers take it for granted that their sons will follow 
their own occupation. The farmer makes his son a farmer, the 
carpenter makes his son a carpenter, the builder makes him a builder, 
and so on. But very often the son has no taste or ability whatever 
for his father's occupation. How often do we find the business an 
energetic father who took pleasure in his work has built up in the 
course of a lifetime, destroyed in a few years by the son who succeeds 
him, but has no such fitness for it! It is so with the professions. It 
does not follow because a man's father was a skilful surgeon or 
physician that he himself will be so. His nerves may be weak where 
his father's were strong. His hand may be unsteady where his 
father's, was firm. Because a man's father was a great painter, it does 
not follow that he will be a great painter also. As well might we 
expect the son of a great general or navigator to inherit the military 
or nautical talent of his father. Yet in how many businesses and 
professions it is " Father and Son " who compose the firm, when 
the son is really a nonentity in it so far as skill and fitness are con- 
cerned ! 

Take the case of the minister. It sometimes happens that for gen- 
eration after generation the son follows the father's profession, and 
sometimes there is really hereditary fitness for the work handed down 
and transmitted, like the ministerial dress, from one to another. This 
hereditary fitness is more frequent in the ministerial calling than in 
any other, for the simple reason that the minister is more at home 
than men of other occupations, and preserves the same stereotyped 



CHOICE OF OCCUPATION. I4I 

manner and conversation in private that he does in pubhc. He sees 
more, therefore, of his children, and impresses his habits and senti- 
ments, his dogmas and feelings upon them more powerfully, because 
more constantly and seriously, than is the case with men of secular 
occupation, who converse with their boys only at long intervals and 
are separated from them the greater part of the day. The minister's 
son, therefore, acquiesces without a murmur when his father tells him 
that he is going to send him to a theological college that he may 
study for the ministry. Very often he is the more reconciled to a pro- 
fession which he would not himself have chosen if he had been per- 
fectly free, by the reflection that his father's and forefathers' names 
are so honored in the particular denomination that he is sure to get 
good positions and be made much of by the laity. In outward de- 
corum, solemnity of manner, the ready use of religious phrases and 
the like, he is to "the manner born," as it were, so familiar have these 
qualifications been to him from the nursery. In the Biblical and 
general knowledge required for the pulpit he can very easily array 
himself, but when it comes to originality of thought and power of 
moving others by extemporaneous discourse, the son is often a very 
poor successor to the father in the pulpit. Of course, if he preaches 
from manuscript, he may conceal his inefficiency for a time by preach- 
ing his father's or some other man's sermons. But he is pretty sure 
to be found out at last and to be estimated at his real figure. And 
then people will shrug their shoulders and say that he is a very well- 
meaning young man, but unfortunately is not gifted with the eloquence 
of his father ; that it is a pity he did not choose some other occupa- 
tion than that of the ministry ; that his manly form would have looked 
better in a soldier's uniform than in a preacher's gown ; or that he 
would have won a great deal more custom by his shallow affabihty 
behind a counter in the dry-goods business than stuck up to smirk 
and simper or show the whites of his eyes in a pulpit. 

Sometimes the unhappy man who becomes a minister to please 
his father or gratify the ambition of his doting mother and sisters is 
himself conscious of his being out of place in the pulpit, and longs 



142 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

to be delivered from a restraint and responsibilities for which he has 
no calling. 

Some few great instances there have been, on the other hand, of 
young men who have entered the ministry under protest, and quite 
against their own will, who have, nevertheless, become famous 
preachers and attracted immense congregations by their eloquence 
and earnestness. A man may learn to like an occupation which at 
first is distasteful to him. Some little accident or incident may change 
the current of his thoughts and feelings. Not seldom a disappoint- 
ment in love, when a man has got over the first terrible distress and 
anguish of learning that he has been loving one who never cared a 
straw for him, but had given her affections, if she had any, to another, 
and yet allowed him to woo her in delusive hope, changes the whole 
character and aspirations and gives a tremendous, almost a desperate, 
energy to a young man's career. Many great preachers and mission- 
aries have been converted by such a terrible heart-sorrow to absolute 
self-abnegation and self-consecration in the work of the ministry. One 
of the greatest, and in the opinion of some very able judges of ser- 
mons, the greatest preacher of the present century, Frederick William 
Robertson, entered the ministry at the earnest desire of his family 
against his own choice. He wished to be a soldier, and his sermons 
are remarkable for their courageous and aggressive tone. Sins and 
vices assumed to him the aspect of a rebel army arrayed against the 
kingdom of God, and few who ever heard him could forget the thrill 
produced by his appeals when he urged men to enlist under the ban- 
ner of Christ as the Captain of Salvation. 

It sometimes, though rarely, happens that a man has supreme 
ability in several lines. Michael Angelo and Leonardo Da Vinci are 
notable instances of this versatile genius, but Lord Bacon was great 
in natural science, in mental philosophy, in theology and in law. 
Shakspeare has been called a " myriad-minded man," but practical 
success did not attend him in life because he did not work steadily at 
any daily labor. There have been men and women, however, who 
have achieved success in more kinds of work than one. Some men.

like Sir Walter Raleigh, have been soldiers, sailors, inventors, poets, 
historians and the like. But, as a rule, each man and woman has his ' 
or her own gift, talent, and calling, and the great thing is to find out 
what it is. It is generally the " ne'er do weel " who goes from one 
thing to another and fails in each. "A rolling stone gathers no moss," 
says an old proverb, and life is too short to allow of our trying our 
hand at half a dozen trades before we fix upon the right one. 

How many a lad, when he looks upon the sea stretching away into 
the boundless distance and sees the white-sailed ships that move 
majestically on it like things of life, is seized with a restless desire to 
be a sailor. He pictures the foreign ports where he will land, and 
the strange people he will see ; he longs to see the tropical splendor 
of the sunny south, or the sublime desolation of the northern seas. 
It seems womanish to him to stay at home and work at some hum- 
drum calling, and die like his fathers, knowing nothing of the great 
world except one little corner of it. Even a father's objections and a 
mother's tears are not strong enough in their influence to keep him 
ashore. Away he sails till his native land is left far away behind 
him. Sometimes the rough experience of a sailor's life suits his hardy ' 
and adventurous nature, but in many instances he repents his choice 
before the first voyage is over and wishes he had stayed on land. 
But if he now abandons the sea after some months of seamanship, he 
will find it harder to settle down into the routine of trade or business 
than before. Many captains even are heard regretting that they 
chose the seafaring life, and advising young lads not to do the 
same. 

It is a great mistake to imagine that regular attention to commerce 
or trade prevents a man from feeling an interest in anything else and 
makes his mind narrow and unsympathetic. Some of the greatest 
of our modern poets and historians have been bankers and merchants; 
many farmers and field laborers, as well as clerks in public and private 
offices of business, have written beautiful poems and stories, or made 
great political speeches and been chosen by their fellow-citizens to 
represent them in the national legislature. A man's mind may travel 



144 THE hearthstone; or, eife at home. 

far and wide while he is toiling with his hands and arms. Of course, 
however, he must not forget what he is about or let his imagination 
interfere with his figures or his mechanical skill. 

To succeed in any work one must have one's heart in it. When a 
man gets up in the morning it makes all the difference in the world 
whether, when he bids his home good-bye for the day, he thinks 
" Now for another day's slavery " at that abominable trade or busi- 
ness, or as he looks at the clock feels eager to be at his desk in the 
store, or at his work in the field, and go on with the job he is doing, 
just where he left off yesterday. It is pleasant to watch the honest 
pride and pleasure which some men take in their work. The 
gardener points with kindling eye to his beautiful flower-beds, and 
as he culls some pretty specimens tells you all about the nature of 
the soil and the time and trouble he has taken to make such and 
such plants grow in it, or asks you what you think of the shape of the 
beds, the effect of his combinations of colors, the neatly trimmed 
borders, the even grass plots, the greenhouse with its tropical and 
early produce. The cabinet maker shows you his last piece of work, 
and tells you how long it took him to carry out his ideal of what 
the piece of furniture should be in design and ornamentation. The 
artist begs you to notice the light and shade in his last picture, and 
tell him what you think of the effect of his grouping and colors. 
The builder, as his edifice rises higher and higher, stands in front of 
it every now and then to feast his imagination on what it will be when 
it is finished and ready for occupation. The printer is well pleased 
when he sees his proof-sheets so free from errors and looking so 
neat and clear. The bookbinder comes next with a feeling of 
satisfaction that he has put the printer's sheets together in such a 
strong, compact and elegant binding. The publisher, third of these 
three book-makers, rubs his hands with content as he assures him- 
self that no other firm in the business could have turned out a more 
beautiful volume at a more reasonable price. Lastly, comes the 
solitary brain that set the whole of these men working — the poor 
author who sat up late at night, and toiled long hours by day to

write these original thoughts, or facts, or discoveries which the 
printer has printed, and the binder has bound, and the publisher 
has published. How miserable would work be if there were no 
pleasure to be found in it ! Who would do with his might what his 
hand found to do, if it brought him nothing but headaches and heart- 
aches, weariness and disappointment ? 

Even in infancy man begins to rejoice in the work of his own 
hands. The childish hands that build an Aladdin's Palace or a 
Noah's Ark with little blocks of wood, are clapped together in 
ecstasy when the work is done, and papa or mamma look at it with 
feigned wonder and admiration. How eager is the child, when it be- 
gins with pencil or chalk to make figures on the paper or the board, 
to turn out a first-rate article in men's or donkeys' heads ! The 
artistic genius of the child concentrates all its efforts on the pig's 
curly tail or the old lady's bonnet. If the child be of a serious 
turn, the face it draws will have a pensive and sedate appearance, 
like a lion in love, or " puss in boots." But if the child be a 
humorist it will draw its subject weeping or laughing, and the more 
comic the child's fancies the funnier will be the picture. What 
pride and delight there is in this, but not greater than that of the 
boy who has learned to cut out with his knife the model of a ship, 
and who hastens to try its sailing capacities on the nearest pond. 
No captain or shipbuilder in the United States feels prouder than he. 
How gleefully do he and his playmates find a name for the tiny 
craft, and call her the " Pride of the Ocean," or the " Gem of the Sea," 
and fling an old shoe after her as she leaves the port in the meadow 
to scud around, and after a stormy voyage of a few minutes arrives 
safely at the same dock of pebbles from whence she sailed. The 
same love of the chosen work and pride in doing it well attends the 
boy or girl who wins the prize in a favorite study. They have denied 
themselves many pleasure trips and social amusements that they 
might devote every moment of leisure to the coming examination 
and competition. At last the dreaded yet longed for time has come. 
Preparation is over ; trial begins. " Well done," is the verdict, whether

the prize be first or second. The labor has not been in vain ; 
the conscience whispers, " I did my best, and I feel all the better 
for it." 

It is no laughing matter, but rather a spectacle to feel sad at, when 
we see a man who would really have attained excellence in one occu- 
pation foolishly devoting himself to another for which he has no special 
talent at all, except in his own conceit. Yet how often do we see 
this ! We find a man painting pictures who ought to be shovelling 
coal, and another giving lessons in grammar who cannot read or 
write correctly. Anybody who can stamp around, and rant, and 
rave, and frown, and start, and roll his eyes, and throw his head 
back, thinks he is a born actor. He resolves to eclipse Edwin Booth 
or Salvini, but is amazed at seeing a broad grin on every face at his 
most pathetic passages, and at finding himself regarded rather as a 
remarkable specimen of the donkey than as a tragedian. 

He is like the youthful artist who has to explain in writing under 
each sketch what it represents, otherwise " Mother Eve and the 
apple " would be taken for the cook about to construct an apple- 
dumpling, and the gorgeous palace be mistaken for a mud hut. The 
label, "This is a man's head," is our only safeguard against thinking 
it something else, and, without an explanation, it would baffle our 
skill to tell " which are Daniel and which is the Lions." So many 
people think themselves first-class in the work they are most 
inefficient in. Did you ever meet a cook who did not think his or 
her cooking the very best cooking possible ? When a whole family 
is afflicted with spasms, cramps, dyspepsia, groanings, ill humor, 
mutual snappishness and quarrelling, a total loss of cheerfulness, 
atheism or superstition, belief in witchcraft, and a desire to torture 
and burn other people alive, soon after they have all partaken 
innocently of the new cook's latest and most stalwart effort in 
dough and invention in pie-crust, will the cook admit for a single 
instant that she has been the cause of this indigestive anguish and 
stomachic misery? Certainly not. She will put her elbows a-kimbo, 
and stand you out to your face that pie-crust is her particular forte, and

that her synthetical method of mixing the ingredients of a pudding 
has made her a domestic blessing to every family she has lived with. 
Perhaps the chambermaid may really possess, without knowing it, 
the requisite genius for broiling a chop or boiling a potato, had she 
not been misled into chamber-work. The too solid cook also 
may have her divine afflatus. She may be well adapted for platform 
oratory or the character of fish-wife on the stage. But she has 
chosen the very thing for which heaven has denied her the qualifi- 
cations, and society has to suffer because genius has mistaken its 
department. 

How many girls go on strumming on the piano and singing all 
the evening, till every other house in the block is posted as " To Let," 
who have not the slightest idea of either harmony or melody, bass or 
treble, a sharp or a flat! But the milkmaid at the dairy and the farm, 
who was never taught a note in the scale, she can sing like the night- 
ingale and make men stop to listen as if suddenly they heard sweet 
sounds from heaven. O that the town miss with no talent could 
sometimes change places with the country lass who has music in her 
throat, in her feet, and in her heart. All we can say is, if the melo- 
dious dairy-maid cannot be our songstress, for pity's sake don't let 
the inharmonious mademoiselle of fashion, whose throat is like a 
nutmeg grater, make us vibrate with her discord from top to toe. 
Thanks for this every day improving land of ours in which strangers 
are so quick in detecting merit and so generous in bringing it to the 
front. The boy or girl with real genius in them, however poorly 
born, and clad, and fed, is pretty sure in America of recognition and 
encouragement. 

All the assistance and introductions in the world, however, will 
not change a stale loaf into a leg of mutton, or make copper pass 
current as gold. Let fathers and mothers, therefore, be sure they do 
not encourage vain hopes in their children by telling each child who 
can jingle rhymes together that he or she is born a poet; that 
their vocation is music, because they can make a noise ; painting, 
because they can daub unlikenesses ; navigation, because they have 



148 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

been on a ferry-boat; or oratory, because they use big words and roll 
out their platitudes. When you see one advertisement, " Wanted a 
good hand at cobbling," and another, " Wanted a professor of lan- 
guages," be quite sure in your own mind which position, if either, 
you are fitted for before you apply for it. Many a lawyer would 
have done well at feeding swine; many a minister would make a 
fortune as a ventriloquist, so sound is he in wind and so windy in 
sound; many an actor should turn scene-shifter, and some scene- 
shifters have before now made good actors ; many a physician should 
be dressing leather instead of wounds, and be engaged in lath and 
plaster instead of plaster without the lath, unless his patient serve for 
it. A life insurance agent who will feel your mental and financial 
pulse and harrow up your soul about sudden death, loss of faculties, 
untimely grave, starving family, suffering children going around in 
ten years' time begging their bread or supported by the State, has 
often been a parson in his earlier years, and he turns his pulpit 
moral suasion and fearful pictures to good account in his business. 
There are bishops who would do credit to a bar-room, and circuit 
preachers who are more amusing than the showman. 

It is certain that many ministers would make excellent law- 
yers, and that many lawyers would make a good appearance in 
the pulpit. This is perhaps the reason why, in ancient times, the 
office of judge was always combined with that of religious teacher 
or priest. In our own times, the minister is very often the family 
adviser about wills and property arrangements, and he is also not 
infrequently the prescriber of medicine. Many clergymen have had a 
thorough medical training with a view to missionary work in dis- 
tant lands, and not a few physicians seek ordination and exchange 
medicine for theology. 

As a general rule, the youth himself is the most likely to know by 
a kind of instinct what work and occupation in life will be most likely 
to suit him. But this, as has been shown, is not invariably the case. 
Still, the cases where a boy's own nature does not point him to one 
selection rather than another are exceptional. Most men who have

achieved greatness in any work have begun early. " The child is 
father of the man," and in . boyhood those qualities are manifested ' 
which become fully developed in the subsequent career. The great 
scholar is generally noted in childhood for a wonderful memory. Sir 
Isaac Newton, who invented when a boy the art of flying a kite, 
discovered when a man the law of gravitation. He had no pleasure 
in mere playthings such as other children care for, but delighted in 
toys of intricate mechanism which employed his observant young 
mind in understanding it. Galileo, it is said, would be lost in phil- 
osophical reflection whenever he saw a top spun by his playmates. 
Mozart, when a mere infant, exhibited that wonderful inspiration for 
music which determined his future vocation. Niebuhr, Arnold, and 
Thirlwall, the two former historians of Rome, and the last named 
of Greece* were all remarkable in their early childhood for their in- 
tense observation and retention of facts. Hogarth and many other 
famous painters, indeed almost all of them, have been remarkable in 
childhood for the quickness of their eye, their imitative powers, and 
fondness for drawing. Sir Walter Scott, when a child, was captivated 
by Border minstrelsy. The life of that remarkable man whose name 
is reverenced by every American, Benjamin Franklin, ought to be in 
the hands of every lad who is trying to decide upon his future occupa- 
tion in life. "At ten years old," he writes in his Autobiography, 
" I was taken (from school) to help my father in the business, which 
was that of a tallow chandler and soap-boiler; a business to which 
he was not bred, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, 
because he found that his dyeing trade, being in little request, would 
not maintain his family. Accordingly I was employed in cutting 
wicks for the candles, and filling the moulds for cast candles, attend- 
ing the shops, going of errands, etc. I disliked the trade, and had 
a strong inclination to go to sea, but my father declared against 
it ; but residing near the water, I was much in it and on it. I learned 
to swim well and to manage boats ; and when embarked with other 
boys, I was commonly allowed to govern, especially in any case 
of difficulty." 



150 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

The men who are to lead the world and come to the front in the 
later battles of life are generally leaders of their school-fellows, in the 
play-ground if not always in the school-room. Individual force of 
character soon makes its appearance, and is acknowledged as soon as 
seen. Whatever the choice of occupation and the results that follow 
from that choice, a man's, natural force or weakness of character is 
quite sure to display itself As those who cross the seas, according 
to the old poet, change their climate but not their disposition, so those 
that change their occupation will exhibit the same characteristics. 
The man who reasons about things will continue his reasoning whether 
he be an apothecary putting up prescriptions or a blacksmith shoeing 
horses. The man who takes everything for granted and walks by 
bodily sight only, and never asks the why and wherefore of anything 
he comes in contact with, will be the same unreasoning machine 
whether he drive a team or feed the brutes of a menagerie. The 
same instinctive love of what is beautiful to the eye will show itself 
whether a man be adorning a house or painting a landscape. The 
sense and sentiments of religion and poetry will be with him whether 
he earn his living as a market gardener or a school-teacher. 

The old motto, " Know thyself," was said to have been sent from 
heaven for human guidance. It is not so easy a study, this self- 
knowledge, as some people seem to think. A great many men and 
women pass all through this life without ever knowing more of them- 
selves than the sheep and oxen do of their own individuality and 
destiny. It is very difficult to believe that there is any future life 
awaiting such grovelling earth-worms as form the greater portion of 
the human race. The contemplation of the baseness and stupidity 
of his fellow-men led Solomon, who was called the wisest of men, to 
doubt, if not thoroughly to disbelieve, in any future destiny for them. 
" There is no difference," he argued, " between man and brute ; as 
the one dieth, so dieth the other ; both are of the dust and both turn 
to dust again." If something within you whispers, " It shall not be 
so with me ; I shall not all die ; I shall rise above, not sink below, 
the common horizon of existence ; I feel a higher pulse and nobler 



CHOICE OF OCCUPATION. I5I 

aspirations beating within me than those of the base, the mean, the 
sordid and the dirty," then carry these high thoughts with you 
in all your work. Remember that no honest labor is degrading 
in itself, and that man has the heaven-given power of shedding 
his own internal light upon the external darkness around him. 
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might," and 
whether it make you rich or not it will make you a better man. 
But it will also make you comfortable externally and enable you to 
give comforts to your wife and children and all who look to you for 
help. It is only the lazy man who is always counting the mouths he 
has to feed. There is a curious principle involved in the new system 
known as Co-operation, which is steadily making its way in various 
cities both of the old and the new world. It is, that the more chil- 
dren you have the richer you will be, because the more provisions 
you will have to buy in order to feed them. This seems quite 
ridiculous when first stated. Common sense bawls out at once, 
"Why, what wretched nonsense ! How can I be better off with seven 
children than I was with one or two ? How can I be as rich when 
I have to buy twenty pounds of bread a week as I was when I bought 
five ? " But when he learns that on this system all the profits, after 
the cost of management, made under the co-operative plan upon the 
ordinary retail prices, are saved as capital for the purchaser, a man 
begins to see that the greater his outlay the greater also are his 
profits. 

A similar law obtains in a man's or woman's life-work. The more 
we sow the more we shall reap. The more earnestness and industry 
we bestow upon the occupation we have chosen, or which circum- 
stances have allotted us, the greater will be the returns, the larger 
the profits. These profits are not to be estimated only by money. It 
is a great thing and should be every man's ambition to provide a 
comfortable home for those belonging to him, and to make that home 
as. beautiful as possible with all that can add to the comfort and hap- 
piness of living in it. He should try to save all he can against the 
evening of his life and the time when " the night cometh in which no 



152 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

man can work." As his eye rests upon house and garden, fruit-trees 
and flowers, Hve-stock and furniture, it is a grateful feehng to know 
that they are all his own and have been won by the honest labor of 
brain and muscle. But the man who has thus built his house, not on 
the sands of idleness, but on the rock of industry and independence, 
has other profits for his toil than house and lands and produce. He 
has educated himself by the noblest sort of education, that of hard 
work and honest ambition. While others have lagged behind at the 
pothouse or the gaming table, trusting to some turn of luck that will 
never come to recover lost time and neglected opportunities, the suc- 
cessful working man has never loitered, but has pressed forward 
steadily, not by fits and starts, in the race of life. He has reached 
the goal and won the prize, not only of material good but of the 
sweetest of all feelings, approval within. He can reflect with honest 
satisfaction that he did not owe his success to luck, but to law, the 
law which teaches that " whatsoever a man soweth, that he shall also 
reap." Those that sow to the wind of idleness will reap the whirl- 
wind of poverty and degradation. Those of whom it may be said, as 
of "the Village Blacksmith," 

" Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, 

Onward through life he goes ; 
Each morning sees some task begin. 

Each evening sees it close ; 
Something attempted, something done, 

Has earned a night's repose," 

deserve all that they have earned. And the best reward of all is the 
consciousness of duty done and rest well earned. This is the true 
socialism, to help others, but be independent one's self; to " owe no 
man anything except brotherly love." This is a noble ambition, that 
of rising from being an employe of others to being an employer of 
others. Choose the occupation you are best fitted for and feel most 
interest in ; give your heart and energy to it ; then the world instead 
of being your master will be your servant, and in the good old Bible 
words, " When thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid ; yea, thou 
shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet.''

-,j^ F every law of life were faithfully obeyed, its nature and 
application having been made part of the training of 
every child, and repeated till as familiar as the multipli- 
cation table, there is no doubt that dying would be as 
unconscious an act as that of birth. Now and then such 
a case is seen, but the physician of widest experience can record but 
few. Dr. Richardson, whose name is familiar to all as one of the 
popular scientific writers on the hygiene of daily life, and who has 
observed with the utmost minuteness the course of life and death in. 
thousands of patients, records but ten such cases. After a life of 
simple obedience to all natural law, temperance in all things having 
secured sound body and sound mind up to advanced age, the intel- 
lectual faculties seemed quietly to slip away. To sleep and not to 
dream was the. pressing need, till nearly all the hours passed in this 
manner. " The awakenings were shorter and shorter ; painless, care- 
less, happy awakenings to the hum of a busy world, to the merry 
sounds of children at play, to the sounds of voices offering aid ; to the 
effort of talking on simple topics and recalling events that have dwelt 
longest on the memory; and then again the overpowering sleep. 
Thus on and on, until at length, the intellectual nature last, the 
instinctive and merely animal functions, now no longer required to 

('S3) 



1 54 The hearthstone; or, life at home. 

sustain the higher faculties, in their turn succumb and fall into the 
inertia." 

This is natural death, and not many generations will pass before 
death by disease will be counted unnatural, and " this act of death, 
now, as a rule, so dreaded, because so premature, shall, arriving only 
at its appointed hour, suggest no terror, inflict no agony." 

This is for the future. For the present we are still the victims of 
inherited or acquired or accidental disease. Every house is at some 
time in its existence a hospital ; every woman, whether fitted for it 
or not, a nurse. That in the larger cities and towns a corps of trained 
nurses is yearly made ready for this unending battle with disease, 
does not affect the fact, that the majority must remain untrained. The 
rich can call upon efificient aid ; the poor, if in cities, can have the 
comfort of a well-ordered hospital ; but where thousands can be cared 
for by these methods, millions are beyond their reach, and must trust 
to such care as can be given in the home. 

A vital necessity then exists for some knowledge of the first prin- 
ciples of nursing, and hopeless as such education might seem for all 
but the intelligent, it has already been proved that even the poorest 
and apparently most stupid working-woman can understand and carry 
out the simple precepts, laid down by a teacher wise enough to know 
how to be simple. In one of our largest cities during the past winter, 
a woman of wide and energetic benevolence brought together through 
a course of several weeks some two hundred women, who listened 
with an eagerness almost pitiful to the careful instructions of physi- 
cians, who had doubted if they would listen, in every form of nursing 
and general care of health for sick or well. A manikin made the 
lecture on " Care of a Baby from its Birth " a very real and not-to-be- 
forgotten matter ; and simple bandaging, changing a bed without dis- 
turbing a patient, and many other essential and usually unconsidered 
things, each became an object-lesson, and has already worked per- 
manent alteration in methods. 

Such teaching need not necessarily be limited to cities. There is 
not a village in the United States where interest could not be stimu- 



IN THE SICK-ROOM; QR, SANITARY NURSING. IgJ 

lated and the same work done by some intelligent woman,, aided by 
the village physician, who in nine cases out of ten will be an educated 
man, thankful for anything that will make it possible for his directions 
to be understood and followed out. Quacks will object, for their 
trade rests upon ignorance ; and patent medicine makers and takers 
will think it all very superfluous, but if it can be accomplished, 
there will be fewer sick to nurse, and better nursing when they are 
sick. 

There are popular hand-books which cover this ground, some large 
and some small, nothing being better than Miss Nightingale's " Notes 
on Nursing," and so simple and clear that it is impossible to err if 
the direction is followed to the letter. Larger books cover the 
same ground, but one and all treat the subject under practically 
the same heads. Pure air, proper temperature, cleanliness, both of 
person and of surroundings ; disinfectants where needed ; suitable 
food and its preparation, are all vital points, whether in log-hut or 
brown-stone front, and it is with these that we have to do in the 
present chapter, each very sketchily because of limited space, but 
each in the order given. 

And first, pure air. Every authority on the care of the sick sums 
up this question in a rule which should be in large letters before the 
nurse's if not the patient's eyes : 

"Keep the Air Breathed as Pure as the External Air, 
Without Chilling the Patient." 

No matter what the sickness is, from measles or mumps up to 
consumption, this is one of the chief considerations. It is not enough 
to open a door into another room, for that room may hold all sorts 
of evil smells, from the fumes of dinner to gas, or the mustiness that 
comes from being long shut up, or from having things stored in it. 
An open fire-place, above all, with a fire burning in it, is an almost 
perfect ventilator ; but few houses have them, and air must generally 
come from the windows. Even in winter there is no danger. People 



156 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

do not take cold in bed. If chilly, a hot-water bottle to the feet and 
an extra blanket will keep the patient warm. 

To make a room cold does not necessarily prove that it is venti- 
lated. It should not, save in special cases, where the doctor must be 
the judge, go below sixty degrees, and it ought never to exceed 
seventy unless specially ordered. A good fire and an open window 
will enable one to secure this, and in summer, when fire is not 
required, the chill of early morning or of exhaustion can always be 
prevented or checked by hot-water bottles. Do not dread night air, 
even in a malarious country. To breathe even that is better than to 
take in the poison thrown off by the lungs, and as there is no air at 
night but night air, we may conclude it was intended to be used. 

Air by means of windows and not through doors which may 
admit effluvia of every sort. Allow nothing in the room which can 
give off moisture. If damp towels or clothing are dried in the room, 
the damp passes into the air breathed by the patient, and may be the 
cause of a sudden relapse. And, above all, let no excreta remain 
there a moment uncovered. It is a custom to push such vessels 
under the bed, the effluvia from them saturating the under side of the 
mattress. If you do not believe harm can be done in this way, 
examine the lid of such an utensil after it has been a short time 
covered. Drops of offensive moisture will roll from it, which must 
go to whatever is above them where no lid is used. Disinfectants 
and fumigations will not help where the cause of the foul odor 
remains in the room, and they are useless in any case unless absolute 
cleanliness in both room and house is the rule. Infectious diseases 
are far less likely to prove so under the present system of open 
windows and light bed-covering than in the old days, when closed 
windows, heavy fires and piles of " comfortables " made death prefer- 
able to the torture they caused. 

Cleanliness is next in order, and though this is partially included 
in the arrangements for pure air, some special treatment of walls or 
sinks and drains may be necessary. Where the drainage is bad and 
the sickness results from such cause, there is no help for it during the 



IN THE sick-room; OR, SANITARY NURSING. 1 57 

sickness save in disinfectants, much scrubbing, and a removal of the 
false system of pipes or drains at the first practicable instant. 

Carpets, heavy curtains and bedding are all disease-holders, and 
therefore disease-breeders. Dust in a sick-room is more irritating 
and harmful than anywhere else, and the greatest pains must be taken 
to remove it. Of course sweeping is not to be thought of during 
severe illness, but all wood work and furniture can be wiped with a 
damp cloth, and the carpet with a dry one. Papered walls are very 
pbjectionable, as paper also accumulates dirt and holds the germs of 
disease. If it were possible for every house to have an unpapered, 
uncarpeted, airy room for use in sickness, convalescence would be 
speedier. It need not seem bare and comfortless, for the walls could 
be painted and thus admit of wiping off daily with a damp cloth, and 
the floor could be oiled or stained, and also wiped daily, a rug being 
by the bedside for comfort. Only perfect and exquisite cleanliness 
can check infectious diseases, and it is the chief requisite in all. 
Those who have gone through a well-appointed hospital, gain an 
idea of what the word means, which even the best and most care- 
fully-kept private house never dreams of carrying out, the chances for 
recovery in a good hospital being for this very reason far greater 
than at home. 

Next to general comes personal cleanliness, and this is one of the 
most difficult points. The poor mother, who very likely bathes but 
once a week, perhaps not as often, cannot understand why a daily 
sponging is necessary. The rich one, who may know its uses in 
health, is in terror lest sickness be increased by a chill, and so one of 
the surest means of l-elief remains untried. There is hardly an 
illness in which the skin is not more or less disordered, the secretions 
sometimes being actually poisonous, and generally offensive. It is a 
slow poison, but a very sure one, and clothing left day after day, 
saturated with perspiration, or skin clogged in the same way, mean 
very often death, and always a delayed and enfeebled recovery. The 
feeling of relief and comfort after a sponging may be regarded as a 
" notion," when it is really a proof that " the vital powers have been 
relieved by removing something that was oppressing them." 



iS8 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

The great danger lies in exposing too large a surface at once, and thus 
causing a chill. It is possible to give a thorough cleansing, yet avoid 
this altogether. A large towel or extra folded sheet should be under 
the patient to prevent the bed or clothing from being wet, and the 
sponge can be passed under the bed-covering, a bath in this way being 
easily accomplished after a little practice. Even in hot weather it 
will be wisest not to leave the patients uncovered, but to draw a sheet 
over them, and thus prevent any possibility of a chill. Where 
special forms of bathing are required, the doctor should give his 
instructions, but in all ordinary cases a sponging with tepid water and 
plenty of soap will answer every purpose. In dysentery or acute 
diarrhoea, the skin is hard and harsh, and the greatest relief is 
experienced in using soap profusely, castile or palm-oil being the best 
varieties. Where there is great weakness and exhaustion, a hot 
towel should be used in drying the skin. 

Beds and bedding are an important question. We have discarded 
in great degree the old-fashioned feather bed, and also the curtains 
and valances of the last generation. The bed in sickness should be 
as free from all drapery, or anything that can hold contagion or 
effluvias, as it is possible to have it. It should stand out from the 
wall, so that the nurse can have access to every side. It should be 
low, to save as much exertion as possible, if the patient can get up 
and down at all, and, if practicable, it is best to have an iron one, such 
as is used in hospitals and is considered essential in real nursing. 
Such a bed with good springs and covered with a thin hair mattress 
is more comfortable by far than the ordinary one with an under mat- 
tress, or perhaps a feather bed, which can never be quite even and 
free from a sense of lumpiness. The best authorities agree in pro- 
nouncing a hard bed to be unnecessary, and injurious as a very soft 
one. A wide one is supposed to afford the patient most refreshment, 
as he can move over to a fresh side ; but where it is practicable, a 
fresh bed is a better method. A very sick patient is hardly likely 
to change his position much, and where he is able to, an entire one 
to another small bed gives the opportunity of thoroughly airing both 



IN THE SICK-ROOM; OR, SANITARY NURSING. 1 59 

bedding and mattress. In airing either the clothing or bedding, if 
they cannot, have a thorough sunning, dry them before a fire, which 
not only dries but airs them, such drying being more important for 
partly soiled things than for clean. A bedside-table is a necessity, for 
no waiter or dish should ever be put on the bed itself 

Miss Nightingale writes amusingly, yet with much feeling, of the 
difficulties she has encountered in this way : " When I see a patient 
in a room nine or ten feet high upon a bed four or five feet high, with 
his head, when he is sitting up in bed, actually within two or three 
feet of the ceiling, I ask myself, Is this expressly planned to produce 
that peculiarly distressing feeling common to the sick, viz., as if the 
walls and ceiling were closing in upon them, and they becoming 
sandwiches between floor and ceiling, which imagination is not, in- 
deed, here so far from the truth ? If, over and above this, the win- 
dow stops short of the ceiling, then the patient's head may literally 
be raised above the stratuni of fresh air even when the window is 
open. Can human perversity any farther go in unmaking the pro- 
cess of restoration which God has made ? The fact is, that the heads 
of sleepers or of sick should never be higher than the throat of the 
chimney, which ensures their being in the current of best air. And 
we will not suppose it possible that you have closed your chimney 
with a chimney-board." 

Let the bed covering be always as light as possible, using blankets, 
and never comfortables where it can be avoided. Weight is not 
warmth, and a weak patient will be made weaker if obliged to bear 
it. The pillows should not be piled upon one another like bricks, 
but arranged so that the lower one will fit in to the hollow of the 
back and the whole form an easy inclined plane. The breathing is 
more or less difficult in all sickness, and the pillows should always 
be so placed that the shoulders can fall back and the head be sup- 
ported but not thrown forward. 

The position of the bed is also of importance. The well person 
thinks little of this, for the bed-room is occupied at most not over 
seven or eight hours at once. But the sick man craves light, and 



i6o THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

there are few cases where a room must be darkened, abundanl sun- 
light being a powerful means of recovery. A patient instinctively 
turns to the light, and is never likely to turn to the wall unless 
indifferent and approaching death. If able to sit up at all, it should 
be in the sunshine, except in hottest weather, and a shadowy 
north room is the worst possible one for any invalid, chronic or 
temporary. 

Where a patient is too ill to move and sheets must be changed, 
the best method is that practiced in hospitals and described by Dr. 
Burdett, of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, in a valuable book 
on " Cottage Hospitals : " 

" When it is necessary to change the bed-clothes of a bed-ridden 
or nearly helpless patient, the following will be an easy course to 
pursue : Having the clean sheet ready, roll up the dirty under-sheet 
as close to the patient as possible, then half roll up the clean sheet, 
and place the unrolled half over that portion of the bed from which 
the dirty linen has been removed. Then lift the patient on to thiis, 
and having removed the remainder of the dirty sheet and replaced 
it by unrolling the clean one, the patient will be made comfortable 
very rapidly, and with the least possible inconvenience. If the patient 
be too weak to be moved bodily, as we have suggested, it is not diffi- 
cult to change the under-sheet without lifting the patient much, pro- 
vided the aid of an assistant is secured. With this method it is 
necessary to begin at the head of the bed ; to gradually withdraw 
the dirty sheet and at the same time replace it with the clean one, 
which must be rolled up and put in readiness at the head of the bed 
before the dirty linen is removed." 

The draw-sheet is very essential in some forms of sickness or after 
some surgical operations. The bed can be protected by rubber, but 
where there are discharges a soft old sheet should be folded to about 
two feet wide and rolled up, letting a free end be under the patient. 
Then as it becomes wet, it can be drawn along on the opposite 
side from that where it was passed under, and the soiled end be 
rolled tight and pinned. In this way, " one sheet will admit of 



IN THE sick-room; OR, SANITARY, NURSING. l6l 

several changes, and by pinning to it a clean one a succession of 
draw-sheets may be passed under a patient, with a minimum of dis- 
turbance." 

In an article of this nature it is, of course, impossible to give more 
than general directions, but principles of nursing are fortunately the 
same for all forms of sickness. And among the rules which must 
be followed, no matter what the case or age or condition, quiet ranks 
in importance with pure air and suitable food. The thing which 
passes unnoticed by the well person, or is regarded as the merest 
trifle, is a source not only of annoyance, but often of acute suffering 
to the invalid. The child may not be able to define this like the 
adult, but the fact remains the same. Some are far more sensitive 
than others, but then one or two rules are applicable to all. 

The most essential of these is one often ignored altogether. 
" Never allow a patient to be waked, either intentionally or acciden- 
tally." Even in health one who is roused suddenly from a first 
sleep is apt to remain wakeful and restless for some time. Miss 
Nightingale puts the case more simply and intelligently than any 
other authority. " It is a curious but quite intelligible fact, that, if 
a patient is waked after a few hours' instead of a few minutes' sleep, 
he is much more likely to sleep again. Because pain, like irritability 
of brain, perpetuates and intensifies itself If you have gained a 
respite of either in sleep, you have gained more than the mere re- 
spite. Both the probability of recurrence and of the same intensity 
will be diminished ; whereas both will be terribly increased by want 
of sleep. This is the reason why sleep is all important. This is the 
reason why a patient waked in the early part of his sleep loses not 
only his sleep, but his power to sleep. A healthy person who allows 
himself to sleep during the day will lose his sleep at night. But it 
is exactly the reverse with the sick generally ; the more they sleep, 
the better will they be able to sleep." 

Try and have everything in order for the night, early in the even- 
ing, so that there will be no disturbance at the time the patient would 
naturally sleep. And in the matter of noise in general, remembpf 
II 



i62 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

that a loud noise is often less harmful than an unnecessary one. A 
flapping window-shade, a creaking door, a stiff and rustling dress or 
squeaking shoes are unbearable evils, and a bustling, fidgety manner 
is equally so. " Study to be quiet," is the injunction here as well as 
in other forms of active life, and a calm manner, an even tone and 
gentle yet decisive movements are of incalculable benefit to a patient. 
Do not feel that if he used a little more self-control these things 
would not be noticed. They are half unconscious irritants when one 
is well, but in sickness, whether of child or adult, there is mental as 
well as physical pain. The nervous system is unhinged and mor- 
bidly susceptible, and " the sick person who behaves decently well 
exercises more self-control every moment of his day than you will 
ever know till you are sick yourself. Almost every step that crosses 
the room is painful to him ; almost every thought that crosses his 
brain is painful to him ; and if he can speak without being savage, 
and look without being unpleasant, he is exercising self-control." 

Above all things, do not whisper in a sick-room. The ear is in- 
voluntarily strained to listen, and in the case of fever, the patient will 
not only be worse, but often become delirious from the irritation. 
Never discuss symptoms or treatment before him, and never allow 
visitors or one of the family to describe similar cases. Nor is it 
well to continually ask, " How are you feeling now ? " Watch care- 
fully and learn how to judge for yourself The faculty of observa- 
tion is seldom cultivated even among the best educated. A trained 
nurse has this advantage over the untrained, that she has been 
taught to watch every variation in color or expression, and can tell 
on the instant what each indicates, while the ordinary one notices 
nothing, and is amazed at some sudden collapse. 

Remember, also, that the horrible monotony of the sick-room is 
a constant irritation. The well person, no matter what their troubles 
and anxieties may be, has a thousand resources which unconsciously 
lighten them, but for the sick there is no escape. Plan to give them 
a little occupation if they can bear it, or at least move the bed where 
they can look out of the window. A picture on the wall, changed 



IN THE sick-room; OR, SANITARY NURSING. 1 63 

now and then, a glass of fresh flowers, or a growing plant, afford a 
pleasure beyond anything known in health. A bare wall in fever 
cases seems often to make all sorts of faces, but flowers never do. 
It is an old-fashioned notion that they are unhealthy, and the nurse 
who will leave her patient stewing and stifling in an over-heated and 
foul atmosphere will order a fresh rose out of the room on the in- 
stant. " They give off carbonic acid." On the contrary, in such a 
room they absorb it, and die a speedy death because they have. The 
beautiful custom, dating back only a few years, of the " flower mis- 
sions " in large cities is beneficent in more senses than one, and act- 
ually acts as a healing force. 

Remember, also, that a gloomy and troubled face is a weight you 
have no right to lay on any one, sick or well. A laugh will often 
alter the course of an illness for the better, and if there is incurable 
disease gloominess will only add to the inevitable sorrow. Aim to 
give as much variety as possible. Tell every pleasant thing you 
hear, and keep the sufferers' thoughts as much off of themselves 
as possible. In a long chronic case, a pet bird or other animal will 
often be the greatest comfort, and babies and sick people are ex- 
cellent society for one another. " If you think the ' air of the sick- 
room ' bad for the baby, why it is bad for the invalid too, and, there- 
fore, you will of course correct it for both. It freshens up a sick 
person's whole mental atmosphere to see ' the baby.' And a very 
young child, if unspoiled, will generally adapt itself wonderfully to 
the ways of the sick person, if the time they spend together is not 
too long." 

Reading aloud is a great resource, but in fevers will often excite 
and irritate, and no fixed rules for occupation can be given, com- 
mon sense being the only guide here as elsewhere, it being only 
necessary to remember that some occupation is a means of cure for 
all but the dangerously ill. 

We come now to Food, a question next in importance to that of 
air, which is simply a form of food demanded by the lungs. More 
and more as time has shown the errors of the past, physicians have 



164 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

come to rely on suitable food as their strongest and most efficient 
ally. A change in food will often cure a long established trouble, 
and certain diseases are now treated by the food-cure — diabetes, for 
instance, having its own peculiar regimen. Where this question is 
understood, drugs may be dispensed with ; and as constant investiga- 
tion and experiment are going on, we are able now to plan the diet 
best suited to the disease. Among the many authorities on diet- 
etics none are better than " Pavy on Food and Dietetics," and 
Chambers' " Manual of Diet." Both are English physicians of highest 
scientific reputation, and accepted there and here as unquestioned 
authorities. Dr. Edward Smith's book on foods is also useful, and 
there are many smaller treatises ; but if one studies at all it should 
always be the best, and if the physician is intelligent he will always 
be glad to explain any dubious points. 

The diet will probably be ordered by him with as much or more 
care than the medicines, and the nurse's business will be, first, to see 
that his directions are implicitly obeyed, and, second, that the food 
is properly cooked. Good cooking is an essential to health. It is 
even more an essential to recovery from sickness, but it is the rarest 
of accomplishments. Burned toast, scorched gruels, flavorless beef- 
tea or broth, with a coat of floating fat, are offered to the uncertain 
or entirely wanting appetite, which rejects them involuntarily. 
Nothing seems more difficult than the perfect preparation of simple 
things. How many persons are capable of sending up a perfect 
slice of toast, crisp, golden brown, hot ? How many, a cup of tea, 
fragrant, steaming and alluring? The gruel is lumpy; the chop 
scorched outside and raw within ; the egg overdone or underdone. 
To make this part of nursing easier, a set of receipts, endorsed by the 
best physicians and long in use by the writer, are given at the end 
of this article. Every one has been tested over and over, and if 
directions are followed to the letter, there cannot be failure. 

There is no doubt that many patients are actually starved in the 
midst of plenty. A weak patient who has had a feverish night has a 
dry mouth, and the thought of any solid food before ten or eleven 



IN THE SICK-ROOM; OR, SANITARY NURSING. 165 

A. M. is disgusting. The nurse, therefore, does not urge it, and ex- 
haustion comes on, when a spoonful of beef-tea, of egg-nogg, or 
some form of good gruel, would have kept up the strength. To wash 
out the mouth in any case of sickness, but especially in fevers, is a 
great comfort, and the physician will give a prescription for some 
liquors of permanganate of potash, which in water will give the 
mouth a fresh, cool feeling, even in high fever. 

A patient can swallow liquid when solid foods are impossible, but 
no matter in what form, the hours for taking it should be punctually 
attended to. A delay of even five minutes will often destroy the 
appetite of a nervous patient, and in severe cases delay may mean 
actual death. " Let the food come at the right time, and be taken 
away, eaten or uneaten, at the right time, but never let a patient 
have something always standing by him, if you don't wish to dis- 
gust him with everything." 

Find out if you can at what hours a patient feels most inclined to 
eat. Often when there seems no way of tempting appetite, and meals 
go away untasted, it may be possible by a change in hours to succeed 
better. Often, too, the being watched anxiously will destroy appe- 
tite. Leave the patient alone as much as possible while eating, and 
if there is failure at one meal, make it up by some addition to the 
next. Leave very little to his judgment, and try also to estimate 
amounts properly and to learn how to tell what has been eaten. It is 
very easy to find out what is meant by an ounce of meat or drink. 
Often a patient will turn over food and give the impression of having 
eaten it, and a careless observer will take away the tray, without 
noticing that next to nothing is missing, yet the doctor will be told 
that the meals have been taken about as usual. 

Remember also that research has proved many things to be less 
nourishing than you may have been brought up to believe. Beef- 
tea is an essential in sickness, but it is not nourishment. It is a 
powerful stimulant, and has what is called " a reparative quality," 
which makes it of greatest value. Gelatine was once believed to be 
condensed nourishment, but careful experiment showed it to be of 



1 66 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

no value at all. Eggs are desirable, but people of nervous or bilious 
temperament are often unable to take them, except whipped up in 
wine. 

A smoothly baked custard is considered very digestible. On the 
contrary the baking of eggs in either custard or pudding has ren- 
dered them almost hopelessly indigestible. Arrow-root, especially 
among English nurses, is a great dependence, but it is really only 
starch and water, flour being far better, as well as less likely to fer- 
ment. Oatmeal, crushed wheat, and corn-meal are all preferable to 
sago, tapioca, or arrow-root, corn-meal being especially good for 
weak and chilly invalids because of its heating qualities. Milk, too, 
is one of the best of foods, and cream as efficient a healer of delicate 
lungs as cod-liver oil. The least change in milk renders it unwhole- 
some, and the utmost care must be used in keeping it. Buttermilk 
is very useful in fevers, and often where used plentifully is not only 
food, but a cooling medicine. 

Do not disregard what may seem senseless craving on the part of 
the patient for some article of food which even the well are supposed 
to find it hard to digest. A patient with dysentery or chronic diar- 
rhoea has often been known to beg for fat ham or bacon, suet pud- 
ding, cheese, fruit, or pickles, and preposterous as it sounds, these 
articles represented two classes of food demanded by the wasted 
tissues — fat and vegetable acids. Pavy gives a rule for preparing 
suet for such cases, and an intelligent nurse or physician will always 
consider such requests carefully before either denying or granting 
them. 

There is great difference in the amounts which different patients 
can digest, and this is apt to be the source of one error in feeding 
the sick. A case of typhoid, for instance, may be ordered four ounces 
of brandy a day, and the nurse proceeds to dilute it till there are four 
pints to be swallowed. Tea, beef-tea, gruel, and other foods are 
treated in the same way, with the idea that the nourishment is just 
so much increased. Nothing could well be more mistaken. It may 
be necessary to reduce the strength of brandy for easier swallowing, 



IN THE SICK-ROOM; OR, SANITARY NURSING. 167 

but in cases where taking food is nearly impossible, this should be 
but very slightly. 

There are cases where nutritive enema must be given, and the 
form recommended by Pavy is chosen here. 

Remember also that the matter of appearance is of far more im- 
portance to a sick than a well person, and even if the meal be only 
toast and tea, follow instructions for making each, and serve them on 
the freshest of napkins and in dainty china. A tete-d-tete service is 
very nice for use in a sick-room, and in any case a very small tea- 
pot can be had, that the tea may always be made fresh. Prepare 
only a small amount of anything, and never discuss it beforehand. A 
surprise will often rouse a flagging appetite. Be ready, too, to have 
your best attempts rejected, and take comfort in the fact that the 
article disliked one day may be just what is wanted the next. 

Finally, remember that there are duties to one's self as well as the 

patient. Try to secure at least a few minutes daily in the open air. 

Rest as regularly as possible, and keep a quiet mind. Patience is 

the first necessity above all with children, who in convalescence are 

apt to be exasperatingly fretful. Every power of self-control and 

repression is called into play by sickness, and in this as in many 

other emergencies of life, the same word applies — " and having done 

all, to stand." 

FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

It seems well, before giving formal rules of preparation, to place 
here the different tables of diet used in the best hospitals ; not that 
they are to be followed literally, but to be examined carefully for 
the purpose of seeing what proportion of solid and liquid is con- 
sidered best, and what amounts are regarded as necessary in " full " 
and " low " diet. The appetite of a convalescent is usually greater 
than when in health, and these tables have been made after long con- 
sultation among physicians who have given a lifetime to the subject, 
and whose object is the very speediest possible restoration to health. 
Having once discovered what amount makes a solid and a liquid 
ounce, it will be easy to judge as to quantities specified. 



l68 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

In severe sickness a glass tube is very useful for feeding gruels 
and drinks, and several can be kept on hand in the medicine closet, 
which should be in every house, for the sake of having in one spot 
all the simple remedies necessary in ordinary life. Small, white 
china boats with spouts are as useful as the tubes, but let them be 
used only for food, as if medicine is given in them the patient is likely 
to associate it with the food, and thus lose relish and appetite. A 
wooden tray with legs six or seven inches high, to stand on the bed, 
is convenient for serving meals, and if there is no bed-rest for use 
when the patient can sit up, a chair turned with the back down and 
a pillow against it is a very good substitute.

Of course, these are merely guides. Fresh fruit can often be 
used to great advantage, and stewed prunes and other dried fruit may 
take the place of fish in winter. Lemons are of greatest value, 
and lemonade, freely drunk, is often prescribed for certain ailments, 
while the juice of half a lemon, morning and evening, with very little 
or no sugar, is an almost infallible cure for constipation. 

Beef Essence. — Cut a pound of perfectly lean beef into small bits. 
Do not allow any particle of fat to remain. Put in a wide-mouthed 
bottle, or a glass can, cork or cover tightly, and set in a kettle of 
cold water. Boil for three hours, and pour off the juice which is now 
completely extracted from the meat. There will be about a small 
cupful. Season with a saltspoonful of salt, unless directed other- 
wise. This is given in extreme weakness, feeding a teaspoonful or 
more at a time, as ordered. 

Beef-tea, as ordered by Pavy. — " Mince finely one pound of lean 
beef, and pour upon it, in a preserve jar or other suitable vessel, one 
pint of cold water. Stir, and allow the two to stand for about an 
hour, that the goodness of the meat may be dissolved out. Next 
stand the jar in a saucepan of cold water, and allow it to gently boil 
for an hour. Remove the jar and pour its contents on to a strainer. 
The beef-tea which runs through contains a quantity of fine sediment, 
which is to be drunk with the liquid, after being flavored with salt at 
discretion. The jar in which the beef-tea is made may be introduced 
into an ordinary oven for an hour instead of being surrounded by 
the water in the saucepan." 

Beef-tea thus prepared represents a highly restorative liquid, with 
an agreeable, rich, meaty flavor. It is a common practice among 
cooks to make it by putting it into a saucepan and subjecting it to 



170 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR^ LIFE AT HOME. 

prolonged boiling or simmering over a fire, but the product then 
yielded constitutes in reality a soup or broth instead of a tea. The 
prolonged boiling leads to the extraction of gelatine, and the liquid 
gelatinizes on cooling (which is not the case when prepared as above), 
but at the same time the albuminous matter becomes condensed 
and agglomerated in such a manner as to form part of the solid 
rejected residue, and the liquid loses in flavor and in invigorating 
power. 

Mrs. Garfield's Beef-tea. — This form has long been known to 
physicians as " Liebig's beef-tea," and is used in extreme weakness, 
but is not as palatable as either of the other forms. Take half a 
pound of lean beef and mince it finely. Pour on it, in a glass or 
earthen vessel, three-quarters of a pint of cold water, to which has 
been added four drops of muriatic acid and about half a saltspoonful 
of salt. Stir well together and allow it to stand one hour. Strain 
through a hair-sieve and rinse the residue with a quarter of a pint of 
water. The liquid thus obtained contains the juice of the meat, with 
the albumen in an uncoagulated state, and syntonin or muscle-fibre 
which has been dissolved by the agency of the acid. It is to be 
taken cold, or, if warmed, must not be heated beyond 120° Fahr. 
No cooking is here employed, and, although much richer in nutritive 
material and more invigorating than ordinary beef-tea, the raw-meat 
color, smell and taste that it possesses sometimes cause it to be 
objected to. 

Savory Beef-tea. — Two pounds of lean beef finely chopped ; one 
small onion with two cloves stuck in it; half a small carrot, cut fine; 
a saltspoonful of celery seed, and a sprig of parsley or thyme ; one 
teaspoonful of salt ; half a teacupful of good tomato catsup, or a tea- 
cupful of canned tomato. Prepare precisely as in first form for beef- 
tea ; strain, and use with toast or crackers. 

Milk and Suet-Pavy. — Boil one ounce of finely chopped suet 
with a quarter of a pint of water for ten minutes, and press through 
linen or thin flannel. Then add one drachm of broken cinnamon, 
one ounce of sugar, and three-quarters of a pint of milk. Boil again 



IN THE sick-room; or, SANltARY NURSING. 1^1 

for ten minutes and strain. A wineglassful to a quarter of a pint 
forms the quantity to be taken at a time. It constitutes a highly 
nutritive and fattening article, but must not be given in excess, as it 
may occasion diarrhoea. 

Chicken Broth. — One chicken weighing one and a half or two 
pounds. Cut the chicken in pieces and the meat from the bones and 
put all in three pints of cold water. Skim thoroughly when it 
comes to a boil; add a teaspoonful of salt and simmer for three 
hours. Strain and serve. A tablespoonful of soaked rice or tapioca 
may be added after the broth is strained, in which case it must be 
returned to the fire and boiled half an hour. 

Chicken Jelly. — Boil chicken as for broth, but reduce the liquid 
to a little less than a pint. Strain through a fine strainer into a cup 
or mould and turn out when cold. 

Chicken Panada. — Take the breast of the chicken boiled as above, 
cut in bits and pound smooth in a mortar. Take a teacupful of 
bread crumbs ; soak them soft in warm milk, or, if liked better, in a 
little of the hot broth. Mix them with the chicken ; add a saltspoon- 
ful of salt, and, if allowed, a pinch of mace, and serve in a cup with 
a spoon. 

Mutton Broth. — Make like chicken broth, skimming off every 
particle of fat. 

Beef, Tapioca, and Egg Broth. — One pound of lean beef, pre- 
pared as for beef-tea, and soaked one hour in a quart of cold water. 
Boil slowly for two hours, and then strain it. Add a half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and half a cupful of tapioca, which has been washed and 
soaked an hour in warm water. Boil slowly half an hour. Serve in 
a shallow bowl in which a poached egg is put at the last, or stir a 
beaten egg into one cup of the boiling soup and serve at once with 
wafers or crackers. 

Oatmeal Gruel. — Have ready in a double boiler one quart of 
boiling water with a teaspoonful of salt, and sprinkle in two table- 
spoonfuls of fine oatmeal. Boil an hour; then strain and serve with 
milk or cream and sugar, if ordered. Farina gruel is made in the 
same way. 



172 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Indian or Corn-meal Gruel. — One quart of boiling water; one 
teaspoonful of salt. Mix three tablespoonfuls of corn-meal with a 
little cold water, and stir in slowly. Boil one hour; strain and 
serve, a cupful at once. 

Milk Porridge. — One quart of boiling milk; two tablespoonfuls 
of flour mixed smooth in a little cold milk, and half a teaspoonful of 
salt. Stir into the milk and boil half an hour, strain and serve. If 
allowed, a handful of raisins and a little grated nutmeg may be 
boiled with it. 

Wine Whey. — Boil one cupful of new milk, and add half a wine- 
glass of good Sherry or Madeira wine. Boil one minute, strain, and 
use with or without sugar as liked. 

Egg-Nogg.— One egg; one tablespoonful of sugar; halfacup-of 
milk ; one tablespoonful of wine. Beat the sugar and yolk together 
to a cream; add the wine and then the milk. Beat the white to a 
stiff froth and stir in lightly. Omit the milk where more condensed 
nourishment is required. 

Rice Water for Drink. — One quart of boiling water; a pinch 
of salt; one tablespoonful of rice or rice flour. Boil half an hour 
and strain. Use cold or hot, as liked. 

Arrow-Root, or Rice Jelly. — Two heaping teaspoonfuls of either 
arrow-root or rice flour; a pinch of salt; a heaping tablespoonful of 
sugar; one cup of boiling water. Mix the flour smooth in a little 
cold water, and add to the boiling water. Boil half an hour, and 
pour into cups or a small mould. For a patient with summer-com- 
plaint, a small stick of cinnamon may be boiled in it. For a fever 
patient add the juice of half a lemon. 

Toast- Water. — Toast two slices of white bread very brown, but 
do not scorch. Put in a pitcher, and, while hot, pour on one quart 
of cold water. Let it stand half an hour and it is ready for use. 

Crust Coffee. — Two thick slices of Graham or Boston brown 
bread, toasted as brown as possible. Pour on one pint of boiling 
water and steep ten minutes. Serve with milk and sugar like coffee. 
Or, dry brown crusts in the oven and use in the same way. 



IN THE SICK-ROOM; OR' SANITARY NURSING. I73 

Beef Juice. — Broil a thick piece of beefsteak three minutes. 
Squeeze all the juice with a lemon-squeezer into a cup, salt lightly, 
and give like beef-tea. 

Jelly and Ice. — Break ice in bits no bigger than a pea. A large 
pin will break off bits from a lump very easily. To a tablespoonful, 
add one of wine jelly, broken up. It is very refreshing in fevers. 

Panada. — Lay in a bowl two Boston or Graham crackers, split; 
sprinkle on a pinch of salt, and cover with boiling water. Set the 
bowl in a sauce-pan of boiling water, and let it stand half an hour 
or till the crackers look clear. Slide into a hot saucer without break- 
ing, and eat with cream and sugar. As they are only good hot, do 
just enough for the patient's appetite at one time. 

Milk Toast. — Toast one or two slices of bread a bright brown; 
dip quickly in a little salted, boiling water and spread on a little but- 
ter. Boil a teacupful of milk ; thicken with an even teaspoonful of 
flour mixed smooth in a little cold water, with a pinch of salt; lay 
the toast in a small, hot, deep plate and pour over the milk. Cream 
toast is made in the same way. 

Beef Sandwich. — Two or three tablespoonfuls of raw, very ten- 
der beef, scraped fine and spread between two slices of slightly but- 
tered bread. Sprinkle on pepper and salt. 

Prepared Flour. — Tie a pint of flour tightly in a cloth and boil 
four hours. Scrape off the outer crust, and the inside will be found 
to be a dry ball. Grate this as required, allowing one tablespoonful 
wet in cold milk, to a pint of boiling milk, and boiling till smooth. 
Add a saltspoonful of salt. This is excellent for summer-complaint, 
whether in adults or children. The beaten white of an egg can also 
be stirred in if ordered. If this porridge is used from the beginning 
of the complaint, little or no medicine will be required. 

Rice Coffee. — Parch rice to a deep brown and grind. Allow half 
a cup to a quart of boiling water, and boil fifteen minutes. Strain 
and drink plain or with milk and sugar. 

Herb Tea. — For the dried herbs allow one teaspoonful to a cup 
of boiling water. Pour the water on them, cover, and steep ten min- 
utes or sp, 



174 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Beefsteak or Chops. — With beefsteak, cut a small thick piece 
of good shape ; broil carefully, turning every minute, eight minutes 
for rare, twelve for well done. Serve on a hot plate, salting a little, 
but using no butter unless allowed by the physician. 

Chops should be neatly trimmed and cooked in the same way. 
A nice way of serving a chop is to broil and cut in small bits. Have 
ready a baked potato. Cut a slice from the top; take out the inside 
and season as for eating ; add the chop and return all to the skin, 
covering it and serving hot as possible. When appetite has returned, 
poached eggs on toast, or a little salt cod with cream, will be 
relished. 

Tapioca Jelly. — Two tablespoonfuls of tapioca soaked over night 
in one cup of cold water. In the morning add a second cup of cold 
water and boil till very clear. Add quarter of a cup of sugar; two 
teaspoonfuls of brandy or four of wine; or the thin rind and juice 
of a lemon may be used instead. Pour into small moulds wet with 
cold water and turn out when firm. 

Apple Water. — Two roasted sour apples or one pint of washed 
dried apples. Pour on one quart of boiling water; cover and let it 
stand half an hour, when it is ready for use. 

Tea. — Never use a tin tea-pot if an earthen one is obtainable. 
An even teaspoonful of dry tea is the usual allowance for a person. 
Scald the tea-pot with a little boiling water and pour it off. Put in 
the tea, and pour on not over a cup of boiling water, letting it stand 
a minute or two for the leaves to swell. Then fill with the needed 
amount of water still boiling, this being about a small cupful to a 
person. Cover closely and let it stand five minutes. Ten will be 
required for English breakfast-tea, but never boil either, above all in 
a tin pot. Boiling liberates the tannic acid of the tea, which acts 
upon the tin, making a compound, bitter and metallic in taste, and 
unfit for human stomachs. 

Nutrient Enema. (From " Chambers' Manual of Diet.") — Take 
half a pint of beef-tea, thicken with one teaspoonful of tapioca. 
Reduce i ^^ ounces of raw beef to a fine pulp, rub through a sieve 



IN THE sick-room; OR, SANITARY NURSING. I/J 

and mix with the whole twenty grains of acid pepsin and four grains 
of diastase, or a dessertspoonful of malt flour. Use not more than 
quarter of a pint at once. Beef tea alone may also be used. 

Egg Gruel. — Beat the yolk of one egg with a tablespoonful of 
sugar till creamy and light. Pour slowly on this, stirring all the 
time, one teacupful of boiling water. Beat the white of the egg to a 
stiff froth with one teaspoonful of powdered sugar, and a drop or two 
of any flavoring allowed, and put on the top. The yolk of the egg 
is more digestible for the slight cooking given by the boiling water. 
The white is much more digestible uncooked. A teaspoonful r f 
ivine may be added if ordered.

' Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of sense, 
Lie in three words, — health, peace and competence. 
But health consists with temperance alone. 
And peace, O Virtue ! peace is all thine own." — Pope. 

HETHER you live in town or in the country there are 
times when a physician cannot be had just when he is 
needed, and therefore some knowledge of medicine 
and the laws of health is indispensable. If you wish 
to keep yourself and your children in health you must 
not only be careful in eating and drinking, but in everything that has 
to do with the condition of your bodies. A supply of simple remedies 
for ordinary ailments should always be at hand. You may destroy 
the strongest constitution and poison the healthiest blood by disobey- 
ing the laws of health, and you may wonderfully strengthen and 
improve your own health and that of your children by a careful and 
con-^tant attention to those laws. 

I say " constant' attention, because so many people take care of 
their bodies by " fits and starts," and begin all sorts of regulations 
which they break within a week or two. A tonic is recommended to 
them, and the dose to be taken as well as the precise time to take it 
is prescribed, but after the first dose or two one hears the cry, " O, 
I have forgotten my medicine ; I wonder had I better take it now ! " 
If it should be taken before meals such persons take it after; if it 
should be taken after meals they take it before. If a teaspoonful is 
the dose they take a tablespoonful, or, more frequently, to save the 
trouble of a spoon, they take " a swallow," the size of which will de- 
pend upon their liking or disliking the taste of it. 

But medicines only need to be taken when there is spmething 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. - 1 77 

wrong. Why should there be something wrong? Doctors and 
medicines are luxuries which those with large families and limited 
incomes ought to try to do without. Not that the doctor's practice 
ought to be taken away from him ; he ought to have a regular income 
and be relieved from all financial anxiety, just for calling upon every- 
body and asking how they feel and telling them how everybody else 
in the neighborhood is feeling. Doctors are among the most genial 
of men ; they can amuse and excruciate at the same time, and make 
you laugh and howl during the same operation. The doctor is gen- 
erally the best informed man in the village, and his society is on this 
account much sought for and valued. But there are other ways of 
getting on friendly terms with him than making one's self sick, and you 
need not pay your first visit to him on a broken leg. He will be still 
invaluable in his neighborhood if he give warning of epidemics, and, 
like the curfew bell, sound the hour when everybody should be ii;i 
bed. His cheerful greeting will do you more good than his long- 
drawn face when he sees you in a very bad way. Let your children 
hail his coming as the ''minister of health," not a "black prophet" 
of stomachic woe. The American doctor, as a rule, is so true a man, 
so noble a gentleman, and so proud of his profession as a conserver 
of health, that he would far rather see you well than sick even if he' 
loses a fee by it. There are some places where the policemen are 
promoted according to the number of arrests they have made during 
the year. It is therefore to the interest of each policeman to arrest 
as many persons as he possibly can, so he improves the opportunity 
by locking up as a " suspicious character " any young man from the 
country who asks him the time or the distance. But surely the 
better plan would be to make his promotion dependent upon the 
good order and absence of violence on his " beat," just as judges com- 
pliment the grand juries when there are very few cases on the calendar 
awaiting trial. 

So ought it to be with the village doctor and undertaker. Their 
fees ought to depend not upon the number of patients they give physic 
to or bury, but upon the health of the community in which they live 



1/8 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

How beautiful would be the ideal parish in which the doctor should 
be able to say, " I have not lost a patient ! " not because he has no 
practice, or because he has very nearly lost a great many patients, but 
because young and old, weak and strong, rich and poor, follow the 
rules he constantly impresses upon them for the preservation of health 
and the avoiding of sickness. 

What a glorious sight it would be to have, in such a parish, a 
beautiful cemetery, filled with flowers and trees and neatly trimmed 
grass-plots, and on some summer morning to assemble the parson, 
and the doctor and the undertaker and all the inhabitants to have a 
real good time 1 After a repast of perfectly wholesome and delicious 
food, which the doctor should certify could do no harm to the liver 
and cause the digestive organs no uneasiness, accompanied with such 
refreshing beverages as should " cheer but not inebriate " or bring 
any headache, the sexton should be called upon to report the state 
of the cemetery. If he could only say, " Ladies and gentlemen, 
citizens and taxpayers of Healthytown, everything I have planted in 
this cemetery is doing well, growing up, budding, blossoming, and 
looking finely. The grass is tender and green because of the fine 
soil ; the flowers and trees are all beautiful from the same cause ; 
the calm you see around you is not the silence of death, but the 
tranquillity of life. The cemetery of Healthytown has no corpses 
in it." 

Then the good old parson would tell his story. " I have preached 
for fifty years in yonder church that all flesh is grass and that grass 
withers and fades, but as the grass in this cemetery is still green, so 
the people of Healthytown have perpetual health, and even the oldest 
inhabitants, like myself, enjoy a green old age. I have not written a 
funeral sermon since I prepared one for the funeral of Farmer Fresh- 
twig, and he disappointed me by getting well — for it was a very fine 
sermon and a pity not to use it. If it were not that this cemetery 
looks so pretty as it is and that the marble slabs with no inscriptions 
look better than with them, I should almost suggest that it is about 
time for some of us to die.'' 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 1 79 

Then the doctor would step forward and say, that when he first 
came to Healthytown he found many children with the measles, and 
many old folks with the colic, and many middle-aged people suffering 
from headaches and chills and fever and indigestion. But since the 
sausage factory had been removed, and the sewage and drainage 
altered, and the pump water was no longer drunk, and garbage and 
refuse were no longer thrown in the street, he rejoiced to say that 
everybody was feeling well, and that he felt much greater pleasure 
in giving this certificate of life than a certificate of death. 

Lastly, the undertaker would tell them that he had added cabinet 
making to coffins, as the demand for the latter was not brisk enough 
to suit him, and that instead of putting silver mountings for the boxes 
of the dead, he should be very happy to supply elegant chests of 
drawers and work-boxes to the living. 

This beautiful world, which disease and death have changed from 
a paradise into " the place of a skull," might be changed again into 
a universal Healthytown if people would only attend to the laws of 
nature for the preservation of health. 

The first of these laws of health is cleanliness. Be clean yourself 
and make every one belonging to you be clean. Shun the company 
of slovenly, unwashed, and dirty people. Cleanliness, like charity, 
must begin at home, and if you ask how to begin, the answer is a 
simple one, " Wash and be clean." Many people, especially women 
and children, are quite willing to be clean if they were not required 
to wash in order to be so. "A lick and a promise " is the extent of 
the children's acquaintance with soap and water. Some of them 
scream at the sight of a bath-tub, as if the delightful feeling of plenty 
of water on the skin were as painful as having a tooth out. This, 
of course, is unnatural, and must be the result of unnatural train- 
ing. Children are imitative little creatures, and if they are afraid 
of the bath-tub, it is because they notice that their parents seldom 
use it. 

What do the parents too often plead in excuse for not bathing ? 
The man, if he neglects it, pleads that he begins work too early in 



i8o THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

the morning to feel like bathing, and that he is too tired at night and 
has to go to bed when the day's work is over. Women — some of 
them, not all — object to the free use of the bath for themselves and 
their families that it makes work ; that water is so often spilled and 
has to be wiped up ; that so many more towels have to be used that 
it makes the washing too heavy, and so forth. The real truth is that 
they have not vitality and energy enough to keep their bodies in re- 
pair ; they are too " tired " to keep themselves clean. Some of them 
are so used to dirty faces and hands that they would feel as great a 
transformation after a thorough, full length bath, with the head ducked 
under often, and rough towels to dry with, as a Chinaman does when 
his pigtail is cut off They would not know themselves, and their 
friends would not know them. What a dreadful shock it would be 
to some families to be accused of being clean ! 

Those who omit to bathe regularly lose one of the greatest enjoy- 
ments, as well as one of the greatest preservatives of health. Disease 
loves dirt. Long life loves cleanliness. Some doctors think that 
once in forty-eight hours — that is, a bathing of the whole body from 
head to foot every other day — is sufficient ; but a bath every morn- 
ing when one is in sound health cannot do any harm. Frequency in 
ablutions, of course, depends somewhat upon the nature of the per- 
son's occupation. Where copious perspiration is produced by the 
daily work, a cold bath every morning is no more than health and 
cleanliness require. Where there is little action of the skin and no 
accretions of dirt to clean off, a man or woman can bathe every day 
or every other day, at their own discretion. But even the finest flan- 
nel or merino, or any other fabric next the skin, will render a thorough 
cleansing of the pores conducive to health. And it is a fact beyond 
all dispute, that those who have accustomed themselves to a cold 
bath every morning, can get wet, pass from a hot temperature of air 
to a cold one, and the contrary, as when passing out of a crowded 
theatre or church into the street, without ever taking cold. 

Some people in bathing make a great mistake by using tepid or 
lukewarm water, because it feels so soothing and luxurious. This is 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. l8l 

very lowering, and would in time reduce the vitality ana muscular 
and nervous energy, even of the strongest. Extremes meet in the 
temperature of water. Water as cold as you can bear it will strengthen 
you, and water as hot as you can bear it will do the same ; but luke- 
warm water relaxes and debilitates the system. If the water is too 
cold, only take the chill off it. 

Be sure to dry yourself with a rough, not a soft, towel, so that your 
skin may glow and be quickened into active work. If you have 
aches and stiffness in your joints, get yourself rubbed, or rub yourself 
as well as you can with oil, which is very pleasant, especially if 
pleasantly perfumed, and will give suppleness and ease to the joints. 
Do not stay too long in the water — ten minutes should be the limit 
— or you will feel a reaction of lassitude. Dry yourself thoroughly 
after bathing, and never put on underclothing that is damp from per- 
spiration after drying your skin. 

It seems unnecessary to remind any sensible person of the folly 
of sitting in wet clothes, yet men frequently do so to escape the trouble 
of changing, and many victims to rheumatism and consumption are 
made by it. 

Many persons suffer with cold feet, the result of imperfect circula- 
tion and poverty of blood. Keep them well covered by the blankets 
at night; rub them to promote circulation, and if these remedies fail 
sponge them with cold water and put a thick pair of socks on. Take 
the socks off when they get warm. Put mustard in the water if the 
sponging and rubbing do not suffice. 

Sponging the whole body both night and morning where the full 
bath is not at hand, followed by a thorough rubbing with a rough 
towel or gentle scrubbing with a flesh-brush, are excellent both for 
cleanliness and circulation. 

Next to the thorough purifying of the skin and invigorating the 
system by cold water, moderate exercise and wholesome food are the 
best preservatives of health. Never bolt your food, or allow your 
children to do so. Let everything you eat be thoroughly chewed. 
Give yourself a rest after dinner, if only for a quarter of an hour, for 



i82 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

the rushing to heavy work just after a full meal is a fruitful cause 
of indigestion and dyspepsia. 

Always keep bicarbonate of soda in the house in case of sour 
stomach, heartburn, and flatulency. It will afford greater and speedier 
relief than anything else, but it should never be used except in these 
cases, and then only a tablespoonful or wine-glass should be taken 
of the solution you make, which should be in the proportion of half 
a teaspoonful of the bicarbonate to a tumbler of water. Take a 
sip as you need it. Used constantly it injures the coats of the 
stomach. 

In exercise, take sufficient every day, either in walking, riding, 
running or athletic sports, to make you feel strong and vigorous, 
but be careful not to overdo it or you will weaken the action of the 
heart and make it irregular. Many deaths from heart disease are 
caused by excessive muscular exercise in rowing, weight-lifting and 
the like. 

Both moderate exercise and properly digested food promote healthy 
sleep at night. Never eat heavy suppers just before going to bed, 
and avoid the other extreme of going to bed with an empty stomach 
after many hours' fasting. A liglit and simple supper about an hour 
before retiring will help you to sleep well. Stimulants, like strong 
tea, should be avoided at night. A glass of pure, fresh milk before 
going to bed will quiet the nerves and assist repose. A little pure 
Holland gin may be added to it in case of age and debility. Nar- 
cotics should not be taken except under positive medical advice, as 
when once commenced they are very difficult to dispense with. It 
is better in many cases to get half a night's rest naturally than sleep 
soundly the whole night under opiates. Where stimulants are taken, 
you should measure the dose just as you would medicine, and limit 
yourself rigorously to the quantity that does you good. In the vigor 
of life and health it is as foolish to accustom one's self to alcoholic 
stimulants as it would be to live on borrowed money while one has 
plenty of one's own lying idle at the bank. So far as stimulants are 
useful it is not as beverages but as tonics, to arrest physical waste, 
aot to create it. 



tHE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 1 83 

The breathing of pure air is essential to health. Some people have 
such a dread of fresh air that they let it in during the daytime as if 
they were admitting an objectionable visitor on the sly, and at night- 
time they say to it : " Now, Fresh Air, it is our bed-time, and it is 
time for you to go." Down goes every window and every door is 
shut close. The fold is made air-tight for the night, and the family 
wonders why they rise feverish in the morning and have sallow com- 
plexions and suffer with coughs and chest troubles. Always let fresh 
air into your bedroom while you sleep. This does not mean that 
you are to sleep in a draught ; but let there be sufficient ventilation 
to keep impure air out of your lungs. 

As for changes of clothing, common sense should teach you how 
to dress in season. But in a changeable climate you should be con- 
stantly on your guard to adapt the thickness of your coverings to 
the temperature of the day. The weather is a deceitful prophet, and 
you may have deep reason to regret the sudden leaving off of wraps. 
But your own sense must guide you in this matter, for every one is 
his own guardian in matters of health. 

Indeed, the strange thing is that to rational human beings any adviet 
or rules should be necessary. It is a humiliating fact that there are 
people who have to be reminded that they need washing and exer- 
cise, care in eating and drinking, proper changes of raiment and the 
like. It is painful to be a cross-questioning missionary of cleanliness 
and have to ask people whether they clean their teeth, pare their 
nails, or brush their hair. 

Yet how many persons who would otherwise be attractive arc 
spoiled by discolored and irregular teeth, as though the mouth out 
of which should come sweetness were a lumber room for broken 
furniture and never needed cleansing! Rinse your mouth and brush 
your teeth every night and morning, if not after each meal. Get rid 
at once of offensive teeth, remembering that an empty house is better 
than a bad tenant. If you cannot do without teeth and have lost all 
your own, the dentist will supply you. Only you must not swallow 
them, as they are an expensive diet and not easily digested. Also: do 



184 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

not plaster your hair with pomatum and bear's grease, the bear having 
been a pig, but use only a little oil if your hair needs lubrication. 
Grease clogs the pores of the skin and engenders headache in con- 
sequence of the suppressed perspiration. Cold water is the best tonic 
for the head and hair. 

Lastly, gentle reader, be regular in your habits as to rising, going 
to bed and meal times. Don't fool with your stomach or brain or 
nerves, for they are partners in one firm that will stand no fooling, 
but will avenge upon you terribly a defiance of their rules. Old saws 
are often better than modern instances, so do not forget the nursery 
rhyme : 

" Early to bed and early to rise 
Is the way to be healthy, wealthy and wise." 

MEDICINAL AND HYGIENIC RECIPES. 

Bruises. — Use warm fomentations, flannel dipped in warm water 
laid over the part, or a bread-and-water poultice. If very severe or 
near a joint, put on leeches. If near the knee, keep perfectly quiet, 
and do not attempt to walk. Keep on fomenting or poulticing till 
the swelling goes down and the pain be gone. Some prefer rags 
dipped in Goulard lotion (that is, one drachm of Goulard's extract 
to six ounces of soft water) to the warm fomentations. Other medi- 
cal men of great experience strongly recommend a lotion of tincture 
of arnica and water; one part arnica to ten of water. Keep the 
patient quite quiet. 

Cramp. — Put the patient at once into a hot bath, if possible; and 
if not, sponge all over in water as hot as he can bear it. Unclasp 
his hands, if much contracted. Put smelling bottle to his nose, and 
give weak brandy and water, or some stimulant, and put to bed, and 
warm the bed, if there is such a thing as a warming-pan in the house. 
If the cramp is only local, that is, affects only one limb, such as the 
arm or leg, use plenty of friction and extension of the muscles under 
spasm. 

Fits. — If you are present when a person is first taken with a fit, 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 1 85 

put, if you can get one, a bottle of smelling salts to his nose, and per- 
haps you may ward the fit off. If not, immediately unfasten the 
neckcloth, unbutton the waistcoat, and loosen the braces. Give all 
the fresh air possible, take the shoes off, and bathe the forehead with 
cold water; then put a piece of soft wood, or something to save the 
tongue being bitten, between the teeth; a cork even will do. Then, 
if possible, put a strong mustard poultice on the back of the neck, 
and put the feet into hot water. 

Undress and put the patient into bed as soon as possible ; let him 
sleep six, eight, or ten hours. Do not attempt to grasp his limbs tight, 
or hold them tight while he is in convulsions, as he will only bruise 
himself Restrain, but do not violently oppose, the struggles. For 
cases of this kind give the simplest and lightest diet: beef-tea, rice, 
milk, tea and toast, chicken-broth, etc. ; and be very careful to let no 
one subject to fits overload his stomach, or otherwise play the fool 
with himself 

DiARRHCEA. — Do not try to stifle it immediately with chalk-mixture, 
opium pills, or any of the common diarrhoea medicines, but give first 
a small dose of castor oil or tincture of rhubarb, or Gregory's pow- 
der, and wait till it has operated: taking care to keep the patient, if 
possible, perfectly quiet, and on his back. In case there i? much 
pain, you may put five drops of laudanum into the dose of tincture 
of rhubarb. If the diarrhoea still continues after the medicine has 
operated, and you cannot get a doctor, then give, according to age 
and strength, five, ten, or fifteen drops of chlorodyne in a wine-glass 
of water every two hours ; and if that does not answer, then a half- 
grain or one grain opium pill every two hours, or a wine-glass of 
water with fifteen to twenty drops of laudanum, and a little essence 
of peppermint and powdered ginger. Feed the patient with dry 
toast, tea without milk, rice-pudding and arrowroot; allow no meat 
and no vegetables, and keep him quiet in his berth ; a warm bed is 
best of all. If you keep on your legs, or moving much about, you 
may have a very bad time of it. A rice diet is very advisable. 

A very able medical man states that he finds the following 



1 86 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

treatment to answer admirably: Commence with a mild dose of some 
opening medicine or other, and then give ten drops of diluted sul- 
phuric acid three times a day in a little water. For common cases, 
not violent, of diarrhoea, the homoeopathic treatment of camphor 
pills, one or two every quarter of an hour or so, works extremely 
well. 

To Stop the Flow of Blood. — Bind the cut with cobwebs and 
brown sugar, pressed on like lint; or — if you cannot procure these — 
with the fine dust of tea. 

. For Headache, wet with camphor a piece of flannel (red), sprinkle 
with black pepper and bind it on the head ; before it is on long the 
headache will be gone. 

Fainting. — Put the patient immediately in a chair, and make him 
sit down, and bend his head low between his knees, until the head 
be brought pretty well on a level with the lower part of the stomach ; 
by these means (the feeling of) faintness will at once pass off 

Lumbago. — Use plenty of friction, with a Turkish towel, or if you 
can bear it, with a flesh-brush. Apply flannel, moistened with mus- 
tard liniment, to the place where the pain is bad, and wear a flannel 
belt round the waist and loins — red flannel is best. If you have no 
mustard liniment at hand, use a mustard poultice or plaster, sprinkled 
with a few drops of spirits of turpentine : it will answer the same 
purpose. A Turkish bath, if you can get one, or if not, any medicine 
to act upon the skin and bring out perspiration, is generally useful. 

Measles.. — First and foremost, do not invite it, in case it is preva- 
lent, by catching cold, lying on damp grass, by any exposure to wet, 
cold, or damp, or by disordering your stomach by sweets, pastry, 
and so forth. If measles is prevalent, such a course of conduct 
would be especially foolish. 

Sy^nptoms. — Eyes running, hoarseness, violent sneezing; on the 
third or fourth day a rash comes out, much as if the patient had 
speckled his face with raspberry jam. 

Treatment. — Put the patient to bed, and keep him warm; allow no 
cold draught in his room, but do not let it get close. Wash the 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 1 87 

hands and face with hot water; keep the eyes clear, and manage 
somehow to keep down the cough, by a bran poultice if necessary, 
till the doctor comes. 

Poison. — Send at once for a doctor, and lose no time. Meanwhile - 
administer doses of warm water with plenty of mustard in it, or else 
ipecacuanha wine, and irritate the throat by the feather end of a 
quill. Should the case be past the power of sickness and relief by 
vomiting and there be no stomach-pump, then perhaps your best 
chance is to administer a strong dose of castor oil, or some even 
potent purgative. Of course if you know any special antidote for 
the special poison that has been taken, use it. 

Sting of Wasp, Bee, or Hornet. — Take care and extract with 
your fingers or a small pair of tweezers any bit of the sting that is 
left in the wound. The place may be then gently squeezed to extract 
the venom, or even sucked with impunity, if there be no scratch, 
crack, or abrasion, on the lips. Then wash with warm water and rub 
some sweet oil into the place, which will generally abate the pain. 
A small poultice may be put on at night, if the pain be not all gone, 
or the place be still swollen. Ipecacuanha powder poultices are 
useful. 

Toothache, How to Treat. — To alleviate the wretched pain — 
for nothing probably short of "cold steel," that is, extraction, can 
work a perfect cure — take at once a tolerably strong dose of opening 
medicine; as soon as this operates, in all probability the pain will 
be gone for a week or two. Meanwhile, apply a small mustard poul- 
tice outside, just over the place where the pain is most violent, and 
rub the gum and the tooth with chloroform and laudanum mixed. 
If the tooth be a hollow one and very painful, then put in the cavity 
a little cotton-wool dipped in chloroform and laudanum. It will ease 
the dreadful pain. A little bit of cotton dipped in a solution of 
shellac, or of gum mastic and spirits of wine, makes a good tempo- 
rary stopping for very bad teeth. Avoid the ordinary vaunted 
" nostrums," that is, the quack medicines said instantly to remove 
toothache. Creosote is the safest domestic remedy to employ, if the 



1 88 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

pain be very bad; only get a friend to employ it, by puttiqg a little 
bit of cotton-wool dipped in it into the hollow of the tooth for you, 
and do not try to put it in yourself, or you will scarify your tongue 
and gums. 

Ammonia is also a good remedy for toothache. Apply a small 
bit of cotton saturated in a strong solution of ammonia to the de- 
fective tooth, and after a momentary nervous pain, the aching will 
have ceased. 

Teeth, Hints on the Care of, etc. — The tooth-brush, which 
should be used night and morning, should be small, and have 
its not too stiff bristles arranged in separate bundles (in order 
that they may pass readily between the teeth and into the natural 
depressions). The outer and inner surface of both front and back 
teeth should be brushed. The direction of the brushing should 
be from the gums; that is, downwards for the upper teeth, and 
upwards for the lower. This mode of cleaning the teeth is the best 
preventive against decay, which causes toothache, and also against 
the accumulation of tartar, which makes the breath foul, and in course 
of time causes the teeth to loosen and fall out. If you use any tooth- 
powder, you cannot go far wrong in employing camphorated chalk, 
to be bought at any chemist's. Some prefer powdered chalk mixed 
with castile soap. A teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda and a table- 
spoonful of Eau-de-Cologne, to a quart of water, make an excel- 
lent preservative rinse for the mouth and teeth at night, and after 
the taking of acid medicine. If the gums need hardening use a little 
borax dissolved in water. 

Whooping-Cough. — -Not much can be done by unprofessional per- 
sons in the way of cutting short an attack of this complaint; but the 
following general directions may be useful. Keep the patient in- 
doors, and feed, or rather nourish well ; attend to his general health 
by keeping the room warm and well ventilated, but with no cold 
draughts. Keep the bowels regular, and give a drop or two drops 
of tincture of belladonna in a little water every now and then. Some 
much recommend a little alum dissolved in water, or a little alum to 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 189 

suck, or cochineal ; but the belladonna is preferable. As whooping- 
cough may cause fits and other dangerous consequences, if possible, 
always call in a doctor. 

Bronchitis. — In case you can get no proper doctor, apply linseed- 
meal poultices to the throat and chest, keeping one on, constantly 
warm, and changing it when it begins to lose its heat. Maintain 
also a warm, damp atmosphere in the room; and if you have no 
proper steaming apparatus, then let "Polly put the kettle on" the 
fire, let it boil, and send its steam out into the room for the patient 
to inhale. You may, too, from time to time, bring the boiling 
kettle near the patient, and let him inhale some of the steam from its 
spout; on\y dofit bring it ?<?£? near him. In case of giving med'cine, 
you cannot go very wrong in the following prescription, if no medi- 
cal man can be had to give a better one : — Ipecac, wine, ten or fifteen 
drops in three teaspoonfuls of spirits of Mindererus, that is, in the 
solution of acetate of ammonia. If ipecac, wine is not to be had, then 
use, instead of it, half a teaspoonful of oxymel of squills. Take 
care, above everything, that your patient does not get a chill, or sit 
in a thorough draught, or the consequences may be very serious. 

Erysipelas. — Give a good strong saline purgative dose, such as 
sixty grains of sulphate of magnesia along with ten grains of carbon- 
ate of magnesia and an ounce of peppermint water (and if you cannot 
get that, plain water) to begin with. In case you are where there is 
no medicine chest, then take half a tumblerful of sea water before 
breakfast instead. 

Follow this up with fifteen to twenty drops of what is called the 
tincture of steel — that is, "Tr. Ferri Perchlor." bottle, in ihe medicine 
chest, so labelled, or else " Liquor Ferri Perchlor." which is a good 
deal stronger — combined with three grains of quinine, three times a 
day, and powder the part affected over with fine flour, or else cover 
it with cotton-wool sprinkled with flour, or else with the oxide of 
zinc powder, if it be within reach. 

Painting the inflamed part over with collodion is the practice in 
some of our hospitals, and limiting the spread of the inflammation by 
pencilling it round with a stick of nitrate of silver — that is, caustic. 



19° THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Ingrowing Nail. — First and foremost, give up wearing the absurd 
tight boot or shoe that has been the sole cause of this painful — it 
may be dangerous — affection. In the next place, do not attempt to 
give it relief by cutting away the nail, where it eats into the flesh 
of the toe by the side, but proceed to thin the middle of the nail, its 
whoie length, by scraping it with a penknife. 

Poultices. — The ingredients best suited for a poultice are those 
which retain heat the longest ; of these ingredients, the best are lin- 
seed-meal, bran and bread. 

Jaundice. — Symptoms. — Yellowness of the skin and of the white 
of the eyes. Motions, color of pipe-clay. Urine, dark brown or 
green in tint. Loss of appetite, flatulence, sometimes sickness. 
Causes. — ^Intemperance in liquors, over-eating, constipation, exposure 
to cold, obstruction in gall-duct from a gall-stone. Treatment. — Low 
diet, milk, arrowroot ; no stimulants, no slops ; linseed and mustard 
poultices over the pit of the stomach. Give a dose of blue pill and 
colocynth at night, and half a Seidlitz powder in a tumbler of water 
three or four times a day, for a week or more. If there has been 
severe pain in the bowels for a day or two before the jaundice comes 
on, and also severe vomiting, the disorder is probably due to the 
passage of a gall-stone out of the gall-bladder. In this case, use hot 
bath, and give doses of laudanum (lo to 20 drops every three hours 
for an adult) till the pain is relieved. Employ hot fomentations to 
the bowels, and give iced milk (if you can get it) and soda-water to 
drink. During convalescence, beware of exposure to cold and any 
intemperance in diet. 

How to Give Chloroform in Case no Doctor can be had. — 
In case you are at sea, with no surgeon on board, and you would 
fain still the agony to the patient, in having to amputate, at the first 
or second joint, some dreadfully crushed finger or thumb, then bear 
in mind that the administration of chloroform is preferable to, and 
safer than, that of ether, unless this last be given by a medical man. 

First: Do «o/ give chloroform unnecessarily; for, even when given 
with every precaution, bear in mind that a certain, though very small, 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 



191 



risk of death is incurred. Let the patient take no food — in any case 
no solid food — for four hours before the operation. This will lessen 
the chance of his vomiting. First take off his boots or shoes, loosen 
his necktie, shirt-collar and wrist-bands, and take care that there is 
nothing tight about his body. You want all the room and space 
you can get for his lungs and his heart to act freely. Then lay him 
on his back on a table, with his head on a low pillow, and let a man 
stand on each side of him to hold his arms ; for, if he be a strong, 
robust man, he will probably struggle ; if he be an intemperate man, 
he will certainly do so. Put about four tablespoonfuls of chloroform 
into a phial and keep it in your waistcoat pocket. Next fold a piece 
of lint, a foot long and four inches wide, thrice, and turn your phial 
upside down in the centre of this, with the lint covering the mouth of 
the phial, till you get a wet spot in the middle of it about the big- 
ness of a penny-piece, and keep this spot constantly moist by apply- 
ing the phial of chloroform to it occasionally. Hold the lint so that 
the wet spot be three inches from the patient's mouth and nostrils. 
Do not bid him to inhale it, or he may be frightened and begin to 
cough and choke; but bid him to blowout strongly, while you bring 
the moist part of the bit of lint gradually nearer and nearer his lips 
and his nostrils. He cannot help then necessarily taking a deep in- 
spiration each time after the puff he has given, so that all the air he 
breathes will pass over and through the moistened parts. The 
patient will probably struggle, kick, and talk nonsense. Restrain 
him without using much force, and as he moves his head, do you move 
the bit of lint in unison with it, and keep it close to, but not touch- 
ing, his face. When you can pliick a hair out of his temples without 
his feeling it or flinching, then he is under the anaesthetic influence, 
and the operation can begin. Give him then more air by removing 
the lint a little farther from him ; but do not take it away, unless he 
begins to snore. This sign always indicates that he has had as 
much as is at all safe for him, and you must remove the lint till the 
snoring ceases. 

During the operation, while the patient is under the influence of 



192 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

the chloroform, pay the greatest attention to his pulse and his lips. 
Don't take your eyes off his lips for a moment. Should these be- 
come purple, give him more air; and should the breathing cease, 
take away the lint and throw open the doors and windows, and resort 
to artificial means of producing respiration. 

Should the patient become very pale, turn his head on one side, 
as this sign indicates that he is going to be sick, and .put a towel or 
cloth under his face, that he may be sick upon it, and then go on 
with the inhalation. The pulse generally increases, at first, in force 
and frequency of beats; and you must take particular notice if it fails 
or becomes intermittent, as that is a symptom of danger, and you 
must instantly stop the chloroform and give all the air you can. In 
any case of danger or difficulty, open the patient's mouth and pull 
the tongue quite forward. 

Lastly, and most important, if any indication of fainting comes on, 
keep the patient's head low, and do not on any account raise it. A 
few drops of brandy gently poured between the gums and the teeth 
will trickle slowly down the throat and will improve the pulse, while 
any attempt to make the patient drink in the usual manner will 
invariably bring on coughing. Remove the pillow at the same 
time. 

When the operation is over, and you wish to bring the patient to, 
open the doors and windows, and allow the cool air to play upon his 
face and chest. It is sometimes, but rarely, needful to slap the face 
with a wet towel. The patient will be drowsy for some hours after- 
wards, and the best thing to do, for all reasons, is to let him sleep. 

Sucking a bit of rough ice, if you can get it, always allays the 
thirst and nausea, in case these should follow. 

The Evil Effects of Iced Water. — One of the most able and 
famous French writers on health subjects recently remarked in an 
interview : " I have heard that you Americans are a people lacking 
in physical health and power. This is untrue. No people on earth 
are stronger! It must be so, for you drink iced water and live! It 
would kill me, or anybody else but an American." 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. I93 

The point to be remembered is this : The normal temperature of 
the stomach is not far from 99°, while the temperature of iced water 
is probably 39° or 40°. Here, then, we take suddenly into that centre 
of the body and of the nervous system (for the stomach is only second 
to the brain and ganglia as a nervous centre) an ice-cold fluid 60° 
colder than the circulation and the digesting organ into which it is 
so unceremoniously plunged ! What a shock ! Is it to be wondered 
that its effect is often fatal ? — that if it does not kill at once, like a 
bullet, it frequently produces dyspepsia, and other causes of chronic 
ill health resulting in death ? 

Cold Tea. — The mistake that most people make in preparing tea for 
a cold drink is in letting it stand too long on the tea leaves — stand until 
cold. This brings out all the bitter, indigestible qualities of the tea 
leaf, which may be somewhat disguised by the lemon and sugar 
added, but remain to torment the drinker. To get the full benefit of 
good iced tea, first heat the proper quantity on a tin plate, or any 
iron plate ; let it get thoroughly hot, so that it would crumble to dust 
between the finger and thumb. Then scald out the teapot very hot, 
using an earthen pot, which is the only teapot that has no black de- 
posit left on it from other tea-makings ; add to this from the kettle 
the first boiling of water out of the freshly-filled kettle, and let it draw 
five minutes and no more. Pour off to cool, and when entirely cold, 
add the same quantity of good milk to your pitcher. You will have 
not only a refreshing but a nourishing drink. Of course, if lemon is 
called for, you omit the milk. 

To Purify Rooms after Sickness. — Wash the furniture, wood- 
work, floor, and walls (scraping off the paper) with the carbolic solu- 
tion and soap. Then shut up tightly, and burn in it a pound of 
sulphur for every hundred cubic feet of space it contains, and allow 
the fumes to remain in the closed room for twenty-four hours. 
Lastly, open the doors and windows so as to ventilate freely for a 
week, at the end of which time disinfection may generally be c^- 
sidered complete. 

To Make Pepsin. — Cut up very fine half a dozen pigs' stomachs 
13 



194 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

and macerate for ten or twelve hours in a menstruum composed of 
one part of muriatic acid and thirty-two parts of H'ater; decant and 
macerate a second time; pour the two products together, and add 
common salt until no further pepsin is formed. The pepsin will 
float on the top. Collect it on a muslin strainer and press out 
the adhering moisture. This is the pepsin so much valued in cases 
of great debility, and which costs so much at the druggist's. A test 
of its strength can be made by mixing a small quantity with milk 
and sugar, and determining how much albumen it will dissolve. 

A POWERFUL ANTIDOTE to Strychnine poison is found in chloral hy- 
drate, which is given in Very large doses with gratifying success. 
Strychnia itself is now considered, by a sort of medical consensus, to 
be the most important remedy for diphtheria. 

How TO Treat a Cold. — When you get chilly all over and away 
into your bones, and begin to sniffle and almost struggle for your 
breath, just begin in time and your tribulations need not last very 
long. Get some powdered borax and snuff the dry powder up your 
nostrils. Get your camphor-bottle and smell it frequently ; pour 
some on your handkerchief, and wipe your nose with it whenever 
needed. Your nose will not get sore, and you will soon wonder 
what has become of your cold. Begin this treatment in the forenoon 
and keep on at intervals until you go to bed, and you will sleep as 
well as ever you did. 

The free use of lemon-juice and sugar will always relieve a cough. 

Sick Stomach, — A wine-glassful of water drank as hot as it can 
be borne will frequently arrest a very distressing vomiting, but it 
should be hot, not warm. Good strong vinegar sipped at pleasure is 
another prompt and safe remedy. 

The tomato is a powerful aperient, and is a wonderfully effective 
curative agent for liver and kidney affections. It is also a thorough 
remedy for dyspepsia. 

Soda for Burns. — All kinds of burns, including scalds and sun- 
burns, are almost immediately relieved by the application of a solu- 
tion of soda to the burnt surface. It must be remembered that dry 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. I95 

soda will not do unless it is surrounded with a cloth moist enough to 
dissolve it. This method of sprinkling it on and covering it with a 
wet cloth is often the very best. But it is sufficient to wash the 
wound repeatedly with a strong solution. It would be well to keep 
a bottle of it always on hand, made so strong that more or less set-* 
ties on the bottom. This is what is called a saturated solution, and 
really such a solution as this is formed when the dry soda is sprinkled 
on and covered with a moistened cloth. It is thought by some that 
the pain of a burn is caused by the hardening of the albumen of the 
flesh which presses on the nerves, and that the soda dissolves the 
albumen and relieves the pressure. Others think that the burn 
generates an acrid acid which the soda neutralizes. 

Acid Burns Cured by Magnesia. — Two French students who 
Were much burned about the face by the explosion of a retort filled 
with boiling sulphuric acid, were at once taken to a druggist, who 
covered their faces 2mm. thick with a soft paste made of calcined 
magnesia and water. In a few seconds, fissures appeared in the mag- 
nesian mask, and a new layer was then substituted. The patients 
,were thus tended for five hours, after which the one hurt the least 
was able to wash his face, which merely showed some reddish spots. 
The other had his magnesian mask renewed during twenty-four 
hours. Suffering acutely at first, the students ceased to suffer in less 
than a quarter of an hour. Their faces retained no traces of burns. 
A quick cure for slight burns is to apply a layer of common salt 
and saturate it with laudanum. Hold it in place an hour or so by 
simple bandage. The smarting sensation will disappear rapidly and 
the burn get well. 

Simple Method of Removing Insects from the Ear. — Dr. B. F. 
Kingsley, U. S. A., relates a number of cases where soldiers sleeping 
on the plains have come to him to have bugs removed from their 
ears. Accidentally he discovered that by holding a lighted candle 
near the ear, the insects would at once leave the cavity and come forth. 
The patient should be in the dark when this is done. 

Nits in the Hair. — The London Lancet gives the two following 
methods of removing nits from the hair : 



196 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

1. Apply spirits of wine freely, so as to dissolve the glue which 
attaches the nits to the hair, and then wash them away with soap and 
water. 

2. Apply to the hair rather a strong decoction of larkspur seeds 
(Delphinium staphisagria). This will kill the parasites very quickly. 
Wash the head with carbolic soap, after two or three days. The nits 
will then readily come away by brushing and combing. 

The Night-Air Superstition. — Dr. Felix Oswald, who is an 
authority on sanitary matters, says: 

" Before we can hope to fight consumption with any chance of suc- 
cess, we have to get rid of the night-air superstition. Like the dread 
of cold water, raw fruit, etc., it is founded on mistrust of our instincts. 
It is probably the most prolific single cause of impaired health, even 
among the civilized nations of our enlightened age, though its ab- 
surdity rivals the grossest delusions of the witchcraft era. The sub- 
jection of holy reason to hearsays could hardly go further. 

" ' Beware of the night-wind ; be sure and close your windows 
after dark ! ' In other words, beware of God's free air ; be sure and 
fill your lungs with the stagnant, azotized and offensive atmosphere 
of your bed-room. In other words, beware of the rock spring ; stick 
to sewerage. Is night-air injurious? Is there a single tenable 
pretext for such an idea? Since the day of creation that air has been 
breathed with impunity by millions of different animals — tender, deli- 
cate creatures, some of them — fawns, lambs, and young birds. 

" The moist air of the tropical forest is breathed with impunity by 
our next relatives, the Anthropoid apes — the same apes that soon 
perish with consumption in the close though generally well-warmed 
atmosphere of our Northern menageries. Thousands of soldiers, 
hunters, and lumbermen sleep every night in tents and open sheds 
without the least injurious consequences ; men in the last stage of 
consumption have recovered by adopting a semi-savage mode of life, 
and camping out-doors in all but the stormiest nights. Is it the 
draught you fear, or the contrast of temperature? Blacksmiths and 
railroad conductors seem to thrive under such influences. Draught ! 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. I97 

Have you never seen boys skating in the teeth of a snow storm at 
the rate of fifteen miles an hour ? ' They counteract the effect of 
the cold air by vigorous exercise.' Is there no other way of keeping 
warm ? Does the north wind damage the fine lady sitting motion- 
less in her sleigh, or the pilot and helmsman of a storm-tossed vessel ? 
It cannot be the inclemency of the open air, for even in sweltering 
summer nights the sweet south wind, blessed by all creatures that 
draw the breath of human life, brings no relief to the victim of aero- 
phobia. 

" There is no doubt that families who have freed themselves from 
the curse of that superstition can live out-and-out healthier in the 
heart of a great city than its slaves on the airiest highlands of the 
Southern Apennines." 

Advice to Dyspeptics.— Avoid pork, fat meats, grease, gravies, 
pastries, spices, confectioneries, tea, coffee, alcoholic drinks, beer, 
malt liquors of all kinds. Let your food be plain, simple, wholesome 
— chiefly fruits and vegetables. Let your bread be made of un- 
bolted wheat-meal. Take your meals regularly ; if three, let the 
supper be very sparing. Eat slowly, lightly, masticate thoroughly. 
Beware of hot food and drinks. Avoid luncheons by all means. 
Exercise freely in the open air ; never sit moping, but turn your 
mind entirely from your disease and troubles. Keep regular hours; 
rise early, exercise half an hour gently before breakfast. Bathe fre- 
quently; keep the skin clean and the pores open. Keep the feet 
dry ; let the soles of your shoes be thick, that no dampness may 
penetrate them. Wear loose fitting garments, especially about the 
region of the lungs. Banish the pipe, quid, and snuff-box, as the 
plague, forever. Of all the dyspepsia breeders and promoters nothing 
exceeds the use of the " Indian weed." Finally, keep a conscience 
void of offence ; pray God to forgive your past sins of gluttony and 
intemperance, for no one who lives temperately as he should will 
ever be troubled with dyspepsia. 

Alcohol and Dyspepsia. — Many persons are under the impres- 
sion that alcoholic drinks are beneficial in dyspepsia, but the truth is 



198 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

that alcohol precipitates the pepsin of the stomach and interferes 
with digestion ; hence dyspepsia is a common symptom in habitual 
drinkers. 

Table Salt an Aperient. — Physicians have for a long time 
known that common table salt is an efficient aperient in ordinary cases 
of constipation. Each morning on rising a tumblerful of water — 
cold, to prevent nauseating — in which was dissolved a teaspoonful of 
table salt, should be taken. This simple aperient is successful in 
nearly all cases of constipation. 

A GOOD disinfectant is made by dissolving a bushel of salt in a 
barrel of water, and with the salt-water slack a barrel of lime, which 
should be wet enough to form a kind of paste. If used freely about 
cellars, gutters, and the like, this home-made chloride of lime is an 
excellent disinfectant. 

Coffee is a most convenient and effective disinfecter. Burn it in 
an open pan. 

The juice of ripe tomatoes will remove the stain of walnuts from 
the hands without injury to the skin. 

One of the most important things to be considered in dress is the 
careful covering of the chest and back. Exposing the lungs by in- 
adequate shielding of these portions of the body from cold is too 
generally practised, especially by ladies. To cover the chest alone 
most carefully is not enough : there should be a thick covering be- 
tween the shoulders. 

For mental headache, coarse brown paper wet with strong cider 
vinegar will often prove effective and soothing ; and sometimes to 
have the eyes bathed with cool water is a relief to the aching head. 

The best remedy for a sprained ankle or wrist, until medical aid 
arrives, is to bathe the afflicted member in arnica, and if it is not near 
at hand, use a strong decoction of vinegar and wormwood. A flan- 
nel cloth wrung out of the above just as hot as the patient will bear, 
and bound on the affected part, will give immediate relief 

A safe and almost sure remedy for an inflamed eye is to bathe 
the afflicted member in lukewarm water, into which a small quantity 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. I99 

of common table salt has been dissolved. Hold the eye open while 
bathing, and immediate relief will be experienced. Bathing the eyes 
morning and night with cold water is an excellent practice for those 
who are obliged to use their eyes to any extent. The water acts 
like a tonic, and strengthens and brightens the eye. The eyes 
should be kept open as much as possible during the process of 
bathing them. 

Early Rising. — There is not one man in ten thousand who can 
afford to do without seven or eight hours' sleep. All the stuff writ- 
ten about great men who sleep only three or four hours at night is 
apocryphal. They have been put upon such small allowance oc- 
casionally, and prospered ; but no man ever kept healthy in body 
and mind for a number of years with less than seven hours' sleep. 
If you can get to bed early, then rise early ; if you cannot go to bed 
until late, then rise late. It may be as proper for some men to rise 
at eight as it is for others to rise at five. Let the rousing bell be rung 
at least thirty minutes before the public appearance. Physicians say 
that a sudden jump out of bed gives irregular motion to the pulse. 
It takes hours to get over a sudden rising. 

Half-a-dozen onions planted in the cellar, where they can get a 
little light, will do much towards absorbing and correcting the atmos- 
pheric impurities that are so apt to lurk in such places. 

Preventive Against Sea-Sickness. — Let your last day on shore 
be a day of perfect rest ; no shopping or farewell calls ; let your body, 
which is likely to be pretty well tired by previous fatigue, get 
thoroughly rested. At least twenty-four hours before you sail, take 
as strong a dose, or doses if necessary, of cathartic medicine as you 
can bear. Eat lighter meals than usual for two or three days before 
sailing and abstain from beer. Then, if the malady assail you on 
your first day out, take twenty or thirty grains of bromide of sodium, 
and repeat if necessary. 

So shall you find the ocean voyage the pleasantest part of your 
foreign tour, so shall you make your trip an expensive one to the 
steamship in the way of board.

Asthma has been cured by sleeping on a pillow made of 
" wild balsam," or, as many people call it, " life everlasting." It 
grows wild in most places in the country, and is very sweet, 
and considered by some an excellent thing for colds — made 
into a tea, of course. The remedy is so simple that it deserves a 
ti'ial. 

A FEW hints in case of drowning may at some time prove of 
assistance to all my readers. When bodies are taken out of the water 
after remaining in it for fifteen or twenty minutes life is not always 
extinct, as is oftentimes thought ; but from want of proper and im- 
mediate treatment the persons do not recover consciousness. When 
the body is taken from the water, do not wait to carry it to a house, 
if the house is at a distance ; lay the person on the ground face down- 
ward, and with the centre of the body elevated a little, so as to allow 
the water taken into the system free egress through the mouth. 
Open the mouth of the patient, and press the tongue down with the 
finger, as it may have become swollen, so that it will not stop the 
action of the throat. To remove the wet garments is the next step, 
and if blankets or other wraps are not at hand, take your own wraps 
to cover the patient. If he shows no signs of life, pat and rub the 
limbs, and roll the body backwards and forwards, slowly and gently; 
see that the mouth is kept open, and that the head is turned, so that 
the water that is in the ears may come out. After working at the 
patient in this way for twenty minutes or a half hour, taking care to 
slap and rub the body, especially the palms of the hands and feet, 
and perceiving no symptoms of a return to consciousness, put the 
ear down to the heart and listen for the least perceptible flutter. 
The patient may now be removed to the nearest house or shelter, 
and haste should be made to obtain blankets, and a warm bath 
prepared. As soon as the patient shows signs of conscious- 
ness, a few teaspoonfuls of whiskey should be carefully poured 
down the throat, and the limbs and chest rubbed freely with 
the same. A warm bath, doctors and proper nourishment will effect 
the vest.

An excellent and palatable way to take cod-liver oil, which some- 
times produces nausea, is to take it in tomato catsup. 

A GOOD idea, and a congenial one to lovers of the aesthetic, is to 
plant sunflowers in the garden when obliged to reside in a malarial 
neighborhood. Cranberries for malaria, and popcorn for nausea, are 
also recommended. 

An important item in housekeeping, and one oftentimes sadly 
neglected by over-zealous housekeepers, is the proper airing of the 
beds. Three to four hours is the shortest time which the clothing 
should be aired. It should be taken from the beds, well shaken, and 
each piece placed on a separate chair. To hurry the making of the 
beds early in the morning is a false idea of neatness. 

A TEASPOONFUL of ammonia in the water in which you wash removes 
all the unpleasant effects of perspiration. 

Advice with Reasons. — Beware of salves, beware of plasters, be- 
ware of eye-waters, beware of v/ashes refining the skin, beware of 
toilet powders, and be careful in the use of scented soaps. Why ? 
Salves make and keep the skin sore, plasters prevent wounds from 
healing, eye-waters do often more injury than good, most hair-dyes 
produce sore eyes, beautifying washes are often poisonous, ditto 
toilet powders, while scented soaps are usually too sharp with free 
alkali. 

The best remedy in ordinary hiccoughs is about twenty-five grains 
of common table salt placed in the mouth and swallowed with a sip 
of water. 

When the finger or hand is badly cut, and when plaster is out of 
reach, a good substitute is brown paper, or black cobweb. When 
plaster has been obtained, press the cut together firmly with the 
fingers, and sponge with a soft rag and tepid water ; then apply the 
plaster, which should be cut in narrow pieces about the sixth of an 
inch wide, and place in diagonal lines over the wound. 

Sulphur used as a gargle is said to be a sure cure for diphtheria. 
This disease is only an accumulation of fungus in the throat, and sul- 
phur is a specific for every species of fungus. If the patient can- 



202 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

not gargle, put the sulphur on a live coal and let it burn under his 
nose. 

Sleep. — Sleep will do much to cure irritability of temper, peevish- 
ness and uneasiness. It will build up and make strong a weary body. 
It will do much to cure dyspepsia, particularly that variety known as 
nervous dyspepsia. It will relieve the languor and prostration felt 
by consumptives. It will cure hypochondria. It will cure the head- 
ache. It will cure neuralgia. It will cure a broken spirit. It will 
cure sorrow. Indeed, we might make a long list of nervous maladies 
that sleep will cure. 

To persons afflicted with cold feet this remedy is offered. Before 
retiring, dip the feet in cold water for a brief period, often just to im- 
merse them, and then rub them thoroughly with a coarse Russian 
towel or a pair of hair flesh-gloves. Disagreeable as this plan is, it is 
often very effective and conducive to both health and comfort. 

Carbolic Acid as a Disinfectant. — Dr. G. M. Sternberg, of the 
United States army, in a report to the National Board of Health, 
gives these results of his experiments on the value of disinfectants. 
Carbolic acid he finds of little value. He says that " the popular idea 
that an odor of carbolic acid in the sick-room, or in a foul privy, is 
evidence that the place is disinfected, is entirely fallacious, and in fact 
the use of this agent as a volatile disinfectant is impracticable, be- 
cause of the expense of the pure acid, and the enormous quantity 
required to produce the desired result." 

To have Perfect Ventilation. — Open your windows, pull up 
your window blinds, turn up your mattresses and bed-clothes, and 
every morning let the products of the night be swept out by the 
incoming current of fresh air. Then, all through the day, remember 
to have a small chink open at the top of your windows ; or, better 
still, raise the lower sash, close the opening beneath with a piece of 
wood fitting closely, and so the air will enter at the junction of the 
sashes and pass upwards without draught. The secret of ventilation 
without draught is a little and constantly. Once permit the air to 
become close and stuffy, and the moment you endeavor to remedy 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 20^ 

this result of carelessness a cold draught will rush in, and the fear of 
injury will prompt you to stop it. The mere fact of living in a close 
atmosphere begets a shivery, susceptible condition of body which is 
intolerant of the slightest sensation of chill. If you accustom yotir- 
self and your children to fresh air you become robust ; your lungs 
play freely, the vital heat is sustained, and even a draught becomes 
exhilarating. 

Household Dirt. — A most subtle enemy to health, whether at 
home or at the seaside, is to be found in the oftentimes cherished 
presence of what may be comprehensively called household dirt. 
The dirt of an ordinary house, the dirt which may be wiped from 
the walls, swept off the furniture and beaten out of the carpets, would 
be sufficient, if it were powdered in the form of dust over the patients 
in the surgical wards of a great hospital, to bring all their wounds 
into a condition which would jeopardize life. It cannot be supposed 
that such dirt is innocuous when it is breathed or swallowed, and it 
certainly possesses the property of retaining for long periods the con- 
tagious matter given off by various diseases. Instances without 
number are on record in which the poison of scarlet fever, long 
dormant in a dirty house, has been roused into activity by some 
probably imperfect or bad attempts at cleansing. The preservation 
of health is not a mere mechanical question of the perfection of cer- 
tain traps to drains, but depends upon the intelligent avoidance of 
the causes by which disease is liable to be produced. 

Ventilation of Cellars. — Housekeepers have to deal constantly 
with the question of health in their homes, and as the condition of 
cellars has much to 'do with good health, the following article on their 
ventilation, which is by Major John P. Hawkins, of the United States 
army, is reproduced in these pages : 

" The frequent and great losses at posts of vegetables during winter, 
and of meats during summer, that are stored in cellars, make it ad- 
visable that some suggestions should be made on the subject of cellar 
ventilation. Damage to stores in cellars is generally caused by heat, 
moisture and light, or by some one of these. Proper ventilation will 



204 • THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

remove hisat and moisture ; light is easily excluded, and ventilating 
appliances should be so constructed as not to admit it. In any 
arrangement for ventilation the following principles should be borne 
in mind : 

" Cold air is heavier than warm air ; cold air has less capacity for 
moisture than warm air, and therefore at the period of its greatest 
cold it has its least capacity for moisture, and as a corollary of this, 
as it becomes warmer its capacity for moisture increases. When the 
ventilation of a cellar is not influenced by the wind, the outer air, if 
colder than the cellar air, will descend into the cellar by its own 
weight, and force the warm air therein upward and out of the cellar, 
and as this air becomes warmer it will absorb moisture, and in turn 
be forced upward and out, carrying with it moisture and impurities, 
and this process continued long enough would bring the outer air 
and the cellar air into the same thermal and hygrometric conditions. 
When the outer air is warmer than the air of the cellar, and ventila- 
tion is desired to remove moisture or impure air, advantage should 
be taken of a dry wiac _ ^m a favorable direction, and having in mind 
that the colder the air the less its capacity for moisture, and as in hot 
weather it is generally the coldest about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, 
it would follow that about these hours would be a favorable time for 
ventilating a cellar during the warm season. Although simple op- 
posite openings in the upper part of the cellar walls might be suffi- 
cient for ventilation alone, tubes for the inflow of the outer air (inlet 
tubes) and tubes for the outflow of the inner air (outlet tubes), with a 
sufficient number of elbows, and painted black on the inside, are 
necessary to arrest the entrance of light. The inlet tubes should 
extend to the bottom of the cellar, and have at that point a 
tight-fitting slide or cap for opening or closing them. To obtain 
the best results their mouths (the outer or upper end) should be 
presented horizontally, and may be hopper-shaped, and be arranged 
to turn horizontally 180° so as to be turned toward the wind; they 
should also be provided with a door for security against a driving 
rain. 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 205 

" The outlet tubes should be placed at the top of the cellar wall, 
and not extend beyond its inner face. The outer end should present 
its mouth upwards (vertically), in order that the escape of air may be 
interfered with as little as possible by the wind, and be provided with 
a tight-fitting cap. To obtain the full effect of the direct force of the 
wind for the inlet tubes, and an aspiratory action for the outlet tubes, 
they may be fitted with cowls, with vanes so arranged that the inlet 
tubes shall always be presented to the wind and the outlet tubes be 
always turned from the wind ; the upper rim of the cowls should 
project a little so as to lessen the chance of rain getting in, and if it 
is practicable to procure a cap formed thus, it should be provided for 
the outlet tubes. This cap will cause the wind from any direction to 
exercise an aspiratory or suction power up the tubes, and will pre- 
vent the entrance of rain or snow. The longer the outlet tubes the 
better this action. 

"Air communication between the cellar and outside, except through 
these tubes, should be prevented as far as possible, and therefore with 
the adoption of this method of ventilation, the cellar windows of the 
usual style that may have been in use should be closed up, and arti- 
ficial light might be ernployed whenever the cellar is visited. 

"The number of tubes to be used will depend upon the size of the 
cellar and its peculiarities, but it is suggested that they be not less 
than ten inches in diameter. The action for which they are designed 
may be stated as follows : The tubes being closed with their caps or 
slides, the inlet tubes will be filled with cold air ; then when the caps or 
slides are removed from them and from the outlet tubes, the cold and 
heavy air in the inlet tubes will move down and out into the cellar, 
over the cellar floor and under the warm air, which it will force upward 
and out of the cellar through the outlet tubes at the top, and similar 
action will take place when it is necessary to ventilate in warm weather 
by taking advantage of a proper direction of the wind. Tile pipe or 
galvanized sheet-iron would be a good material for these tubes, or 
they could be made of boards seamed with white or red lead, and 
secured with screws. If made of galvanized iron their efficacy would 



206 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

be increased by encasing them tightly with boards. This would pre- 
vent the inlet tubes from being warmed by the higher temperature 
of the cellar, and the outlet tubes from being cooled by the lower 
outside temperature, and if an outlet tube could be carried inside the 
cellar up to and through the roof, its efficacy would be much increased, 
and when practicable a chimney flue leading from the cellar to the 
roof may be utilized as an outlet tube. An approved method for an 
inlet tube, to preserve a uniform temperature, is to lay a pipe six feet 
below the surface of the ground, connecting with the cellar and a 
point about sixty feet distant; at this latter point erect a ven- 
tilating shaft for the inflow of the outer air, which, passing through 
the length of this pipe, will be warme:d in winter and cooled in 
summer. 

" To illustrate the efficacy with which cold air acts as a vehicle for 
the removal of moisture, it may be stated approximately, that if the 
outer air at a temperature of zero Fahrenheit be admitted to a cellar, 
and raised therein to a temperature of 60 degrees, it could absorb 
and carry out about 5 Troy grains of moisture per cubic foot, and if 
raised to 100 degrees, it could absorb and carry out about 19 
grains per cubic foot." 

Cure for Earache. — Earache may be produced from various 
causes. Accumulation of wax pressing on the drum of the ear; 
congestions and inflammation of the inner ear ; the presence of in- 
sects or foreign substances ; catarrh and various affections of the 
brain. In cases of earache arising from an accumulation of wax, 
syringe the ear thoroughly with soap and water, or water in which is 
dissolved bi-carbonate of soda or borax, in the proportion of a tea- 
spoonful to a quart of water. At least a quart of water should be 
used and the operation repeated twice a day. Always have the 
waler warm. After washing out the ear insert a pledget of lint or 
cotton soaked in glycerine ; if much pain exists a few drops of 
laudanum may be added. Never use a pin to pick the ears with. 
It is seldom that anything is necessary ; when it is, an ear spoon 
made for the purpose, or, what is better, a bit of sponge on the end 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 20/ 

of a probe, such as are sold in drug stores, may be used. When 
there is congestion or inflammation there is likely to be a good deal 
of pain. Relief may be obtained by the application of poultices to 
the ear, or rub a little camphor liniment back of the ear. Steaming 
is often useful. In the absence of an instrument for that purpose, 
this may be done by heating a brick very hot, enveloping it with 
flannel, then pouring vinegar upon it and holding it to the ear. 
Relief has been given by wetting a pledget of cotton in chloroform, 
putting it into a common clay pipe, inserting the stem into the ear 
and blowing through the bowl. The vapor of the chloroform is thus 
forced into the ear. 

The Prevention of Sunstroke. — To avoid sunstroke, exercise in 
excessively hot weather should be very moderate ; the clothing 
should be thin and loose, and an abundance of cold water should be 
drunk. Workmen and soldiers should understand that as soon 
as they cease to perspire, while working or marching in the hot 
sun, they are in danger of sunstroke, and they should immediately 
drink water freely and copiously to afford matter for cutaneous 
transpiration, and also keep the skin and clothing wet< with water- 
Impending sunstroke may often be warded off by these simple meas- 
ures. Besides the cessation of perspiration, the pupils are apt to be 
contracted, and there is great frequency of micturition. If there is 
marked exhaustion, with a weak pulse, resulting from the cold water 
application, stimulants should be administered. The free use of water, 
however, both externally and internally, by those exposed to the 
direct rays of the sun, is the best protection against sunstroke, and 
laborers or soldiers, and others who adopt this measure, washing 
their hands and faces, as well as drinking copiously of water every 
time they come within reach of it, will generally enjoy perfect im- 
munity from sunstroke. Straw hats should be worn, ventilated at 
the top, and the crown of the hat filled with green leaves or wet 
sponge. It is better to wear thin flannel shirts, in order not to check 
perspiration. We may expose ourselves for a long time in the hot 
sun, and work or sleep in a heated room, and enjoy perfect immunity 
from sunstroke, if we keep our skin and clothing wet with water.

Unrecognized Qualities in Charcoal. — Among the numerous 
and varied properties possessed by charcoal there is one — one, toe. 
of the most wonderful — which does not seem to be adequately recog- 
nized, probably from its being imperfectly known except to physicists. 
It is that of being able to condense and store away in its pores many 
times its own bulk of certain gaseous bodies, which it retains, thus 
compressed in an otherwise unaltered condition, and from which they 
can be withdrawn, as required, as from a reservoir. It is this enor- 
mous absorptive power that renders of so much value a compara- 
tively slight sprinkling of charcoal over dead animal matter as a pre- 
ventive of the escape of the odors arising from decomposition. A 
dead dog having been placed in a box in the warm laboratory of an 
eminent chemist, and covered with charcoal to the depth of between 
two and three inches, could not be discovered to have emitted any 
smell during several months, after which time an examination showed 
that nothing of the animal remained but the bones and a small por- 
tion of the skin. 

Worth Remembering. — Persons travelling by railway are subject 
to continued annoyance from flying cinders. On getting into the 
eyes they are not only painful for the moment, but are often the 
cause of long suffering, that ends in total loss of sight. A very 
simple and effective cure is within the reach of every one, and would 
prevent much suffering and expense were it more generally known 
It is simply one or two grains of flaxseed. These may be placed in 
the eye without injury or pain to that delicate organ, and shortly 
they begin to swell and dissolve a glutinous substance that covers 
the ball of the eye, enveloping any foreign substance that may be in 
it. The irritation or cutting of the membrane is thus prevented, and 
the annoyance may soon be washed out. A dozen of these grains 
stowed away in the vest pocket may prove, in an emergency, worth 
their number in gold dollars. A horse hair twisted into a loop can - 
fully inserted under the eyelid will remove cinders. 

Cure for a Felon. — The cure is said to be certain, and is pub- 
lished at the particular request of a person who has experienced its 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. 2O9 

success for a great number of years. Take a piece of rock salt about 
the size of a walnut and wrap it up closely in a green cabbage leaf, 
but, if not to be had, in a piece of brown paper well ' moistened with 
water ; lay it on hot embers and cover it up as if to roast for twenty 
minutes ; take it up and powder it as fine as possible ; then take some 
hard soap and mix the powdered salt with it so as to make a salve. 
If the soap should contain but little turpentine, which its smell will 
determine, add some more, but if it smells pretty strongly of it, none 
need be added. Apply the salve to the part affected, and in a short 
time it will totally destroy the felon and remove the pain. 

Medical Value of Asparagus. — A medical correspondent of an 
English journal says that the advantages of asparagus are not suffi- 
ciently appreciated by those who suffer with rheumatism and gout. 
Slight cases of rheumatism are cured in a few days by feeding on 
this delicious esculent; and more chronic cases are much relieved, 
especially if the patient avoids all acids, whether in food or beverage. 
The Jerusalem artichoke has also a similar effect in relieving rheuma- 
tism. The heads may be eaten in the usual way, but tea made from 
the leaves of the stalk and taken three or four times a day is a cer- 
tain remedy, though not equally agreeable. 

Sticking-Plaster. — An excellent sticking-plaster for fresh cuts or 
cracked hands is made of three pounds of rosin, a quarter of a 
pound of beeswax, a quarter of a pound of mutton tallow. When 
well melted and dissolved together, remove from the fire and keep 
stirring till it is about as cool as it will pour ; then add one table- 
spoonful of spirits of turpentine ; then pour the whole into a pail of 
cold water, and when cool enough take it out and work if as a shoe- 
maker does his wax. When sufficiently worked, roll it out in small 
sticks. This is equal to any plaster ever bought. Keep the hands 
greased, to prevent it from sticking to them while working it. 

Diphtheria. — Dissolve one tablespoonful of sulphur in a glass of 

cold water ; gargle the throat six or eight times a day. Cook salt 

pork in vinegar and bind on the throat ; when the paroxysms come 

on soak the hands and feet in just as hot water as the patient will 

14 



2IO THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

bear, with a tablespoon of baking soda thrown in. Rubbing the 
limbs and body will assist greatly in throwing off the disease. 
The simple sulphur remedy is very effectual in common sore throat. 

Mustard Plaster. — By using syrup or molasses for mustard 
plasters they will keep soft and flexible, and not dry up and become 
hard, as when mixed with water. A thin paper or fine cloth should 
come between the plaster and the skin. The strength of the plaster 
is varied by the addition of more or less flour. 

To Stop Bleeding at the Nose. — A French surgeon says the 
simple elevation of a person's arm will stop bleeding at the nose. 
He explains the fact physiologically, and declares it a positive 
remedy. It is certainly easy of trial. Or, a strong solution of alum 
water, snuffed up the nostril, will cure in most cases, without any- 
thing further. 

To Cure Colic. — For the violent internal agony termed colic, 
take a teaspoonful of salt in a pint of cold water ; drink it and go to 
bed. It is one of the speediest remedies known. The same will re- 
vive a person who seems almost dead from a heavy fall. 

Cure for Hoarseness. — -Take the whites of two eggs and beat 
them with two teaspoonfuls of white sugar, grate in a little nutmeg, 
then add a pint of lukewarm water ; stir well, drink often, and it will 
cure the most obstinate case of hoarseness in a short time. 

Gargle for Sore Throat. — Take one teaspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, one teaspoonful of salt, one pint of water, two tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar ; sweeten to taste with honey or loaf sugar. Mix to- 
gether and bottle. 

An excellent way to cure a sore throat is to bind the neck with a 
towel soaked in ice or very cold water, and then outside of this placfe 
a dry towel. Wear this during the night, and in the morning the 
throat will be much better. 

Hot Lemonade is one of the best remedies in the world for a cold. 
It acts promptly and effectively, and has no unpleasant effects. One 
lemon properly squeezed, cut in slices, put with sugar and covered 
with half a pint of boiling water. Drink just before going to bed. 



THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HOME. , 211 

and do not expose yourself on the following day. This remedy will 
ward off an attack of the chills and fever if used promptly. 

To Prevent Choking. — Break an egg into a cup and give it to the 
person choking to swallow. The white of the egg seems to catch 
around the obstacle and remove it. If one egg does not answer the 
purpose try another. The white is all that is necessary. 

To Remove Proud Flesh. — Pulverize loaf sugar very fine and 
apply it to the part afflicted. This is a new and easy remedy, and is 
said to remove it without pain ; or burnt alum pulverized and applied 
is an old and reliable remedy. 

Stings and Bites. — Carbonate of soda wet and applied externally 
to the bite of a spider, or any venomous creature, will neutralize the 
poisonous effect almost instantly. It acts like a charm in the case 
of snake bite. 

Lean Fresh Meat will remove the pain of a wasp-sting almost 
instantly, and has been recommended for the cure of rattlesnake- 
bites. It is said to have a marked benefit in cases of erysipelas. 

Common Salt, mixed in cold water (tolerably strong), and used as a 
gargle night and morning, is found to harden the throat and keep 
off bronchial attacks. 

How TO Remove Stiffness and Aching of the Limbs after a 
very long Ride, Walk, Row, or Day on the Ice. — Sponge all over 
with water, as hot as you can bear it, just before going to bed; and 
if you have had any bad bruises, use plenty of hot fomentations with 
tincture of arnica, in the proportion of one part of arnica to twelve 
of water. Then put bright, clear, hot cinders into a warming-pan, 
and upon them, just before proceeding to warm the bed, throw a 
large handful of the commonest, coarsest brown sugar you can get. 
. Warm the bed thoroughly with the pan, so that it is filled with the 
hot steam and vapor from the sugar ; slip in neatly and cleverly, so 
as to allow as little as possible of the steam to escape. Get some 
one to tuck you in tight, all round, go to sleep warm and cosy in 
your sugar-vapor bath, and the chances are that you will awake next 
morning light and limber, without an ache or twinge. 



212 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

Swelled Neck. — Wash the part with brine, and drink it also 
twice a day until cured. 

The Lemon. — Few people know the value of lemon-juice. A 
piece of lemon bound upon a corn will cure it in a few days ; it 
should be renewed night and morning. A free use of lemon- 
juice and sugar will always relieve a cough. Most people feel 
poorly in the spring, but if they would eat a lemon before breakfast 
every day for a week — with or without sugar, as they like — they 
would find it better than any medicine. Lemon-juice used according 
to this recipe will sometimes cure consumption : Put a dozen lemons 
into cold water and slowly bring to a boil; boil slowly until the 
lemons are soft, then squeeze until all the juice is extracted; add 
sugar to your taste, and drink. In this way use one dozen lemons a 
day. If they cause pain, or loosen the bowels too much, lessen the 
quantity, and use only five or six a day until you are better, and 
then begin again with a dozen a day. After using five or six dozen, 
the patient will begin to gain flesh and enjoy food. Hold on to the 
lemons, and still use them very freely for several weeks more. 
Another use for lemons is for a refreshing drink in summer, or in 
sickness at any time. Prepare as directed above, and add water and 
sugar. But in order to have this kept well, after boiling the lemons, 
squeeze and strain carefully; then to every half-pint of juice add one 
pound of loaf or crushed sugar, boil and stir a few minutes more 
until the sugar is dissolved, skim carefully, and bottle. You will get 
more juice from the lemons by boiling them, and the preparation 
keeps better. 

Fasting is recommended as a cure for rheumatism. In cases 
of acute articular rheumatism the fasting must be continued from 
four to eight days. In no case is it necessary to fast more than ten' 
days. Patients may drink freely of cold water or lemonade in 
moderate quantities. No medicines are to be taken. Less positive 
results are obtained in cases of chronic rheumatism than in acute 
cases. The latter form of rheumatism is, after all, only a phase of 
indigestion, and is cured by giving complete rest to all the viscera.

Cure for Neuralgia. — Mix an egg with corn-meal, or any coarse 
flour, and apply the poultice to the face or parts affected. This is a 
good remedy for toothache. 

In these days of neuralgia and sudden colds it is sensible to have 
some means of relief close- at hand. Make two or three little bags 
of cotton cloth and fill them with hops. Then when you need them 
heat just as hot as possible even to the extent of browning the cloth, 
and apply to the aching member. People who cannot endure the 
odor of the old-time remedy of hops and vinegar do not object to 
the hops alone. The dry hop-bag is a great improvement upon wet 
cloths of any kind. 

To Relieve Sciatica and Severe Neuralgic Pains. — Heat a 
flat-iron sufficiently hot to vaporize vinegar, wrap it in woollen cloth 
moistened with vinegar, and apply as warm as can be borne to the 
painful spot two or three times a day. As a rule, the pain disap- 
pears within twenty-four hours, and recovery is rapid. 

A Physician finds a preparation of oatmeal and beef-tea useful in 
giving strength to weak patients. To make it, take two tablespoon- 
fuls of fine oatmeal and make it perfectly smooth in two spoonfuls 
of cold water ; pour into this a pint of strong beef-tea ; boil it eight 
minutes ; keep stirring all the time ; it should be very smooth ; if 
lumpy pass through a sieve. 

In a room heated by a grate fire, and in fact in all rooms heated by 
artificial means, a glass or basin full of water will absorb the impure 
air arising from the gas in the coal, and keep the air pure. Birds or 
fish which are confined in stove-heated rooms often die from the. 
impure air, and flowers and plants also. 

A Certain Remedy for Corns. — Dissolve four pearl buttons in 
the juice of one lemon. Add a little water, put in a bottle, shake 
well, and use night and morning. After a few days the mixture will 
have to be renewed. If persistently used, it will destroy corns. 

Catarrh Remedy. — Take a pint of soft water, and put in a table- 
spoonful of fine salt — as much salt may be used as will dissolve well 
Take two teaspoonfuls before going to bed.

To Remove Warts. — Tincture of cantharides, with some drops of 
tincture of iodine ; apply to warts with a small brush or little stick 
three or four times a day. In a few days the warts will disappear. 

Cautions n Visiting the Sick. — Do not visit the sick when you 
are fatigued, oi when in a state of perspiration, or when the stomach 
is empty, for, in such conditions, you are liable to take the infection. 

To Disguise Castor-Oil. — Rub two drops of oil of cinnamon 
with an ounce of glycerine and an ounce of castor-oil. Children will 
take without hesitation. 

Coughing can be stopped by pressing on the nerves of the lip in 
the neighborhood of the nose. A pressure there may prevent a 
cough when it is beginning. Sneezing may be stopped by the same 
mechanism. Pressing, also, in the neighborhood of the ear, right in 
front of the ear, may stop coughing. It is so also of hiccough, but 
much less so than for sneezing or coughing. 

Croup can be quickly cured with alum and sugar. Shave or grate 
off about a teaspoonful of alum, then mix it with twice its quantity 
of sugar (to make it palatable) and administer as promptly as pos- 
sible. If it is shaved off instead of grated, care should be taken to 
have it cut in small particles. 

Flannel should, in almost all instances, be worn by women and 
children, next to the skin, in winter. The same garment should not 
be used at night that is worn during the day. Cleanliness demands 
a change, and comfort would be increased by wearing a lighter article 
at night. 

To make a mustard plaster that will draw well, but not blister, 
mix with the white of an egg instead of water or vinegar. 

The White of an Egg is a most efficacious remedy for burns. 
Seven or eight successive applications of this substance soothe pain, 
and effectually exclude the air from the burn. 

Opening the Eyes and submerging them in clean salt-water has 
been found beneficial to those whose eyesight is impaired by weak- 
ness or soreness. Bathing the eyes in salt-water is the best of pre- 
scriptions for strengthening and healing them.

Chloride of Lime is essential to the purification of all sick-rooms. 
It keeps the atmosphere healthy, even in the most terrible epidemic 
diseases. 

It is a Mistake to load a weak stomach with water on the theory 
that it is a tonic. Water should be taken only as it is desired to 
quench thirst. 

The Leaves of Geranium are an excellent application for cuts, 
when the skin is rubbed off, and other wounds of the same kind. 
One or two leaves must be bruised and applied on linen to the part, 
and the wound will become cicatrized in a very short time. 

Two Teaspoonfuls of finely-powdered charcoal taken in a half- 
tumbler of water will often give relief to the sick headache, when 
caused, as in most cases it is, by a superabundance of acid on the 
stomach. 

In Smallpox the pits can be entirely prevented by covering the 
pustules as fast as they break with a coating of collodion — a liquid 
cuticle sold by all druggists. 

When a person is overheated and exhausted, both the hands and 
feet should be bathed in cold water, and something warm should be 
taken at once — hot lemonade, ginger water» or something of this 
kind. 




ECONOMY IN THE HOME. 

"A penny saved is two pence clear, 
A pin a day's a groat a year." 



'OMESTIC ECONOMY ought to rank as one of the fine 
arts. It is a duty which everybody preaches, but very 
few know how to practise. There is stinginess in 
thousands of homes, but true economy and good man- 
agement in very few. There are thousands of house- 
keepers who mistake meanness for economy, and there are thousands 
more who want to be economical and don't know how. What they 
save in one thing they waste in another, so that their efforts to re- 
duce their household expenses are like pouring water into a bucket 
that has a hole in the bottom. What is put in at one end runs out 
at the other. The dollar saved in a carpet is spent upon some frail 
mantel ornament which is broken the first week. What is saved in 
the gown is lost in the bonnet, and people will go without a new 
pair of shoes which they need to buy a new ribbon which they don't 
need. There are men who will walk two miles to save a five-cent 
car fare and spend the five cents on the way in a vile cigar made of 
cabbage leaf, or a glass of froth which makes them hiccough for the rest 
of the journey. There are women who will go slipshod with their 
heels out of their stockings all the week in order to astonish their 
neighbors by some piece of finery on the Sunday. There are families 
that are half starved during the week in order to eat too much at 
Sunday's dinner. There are mothers who will even sacrifice their 
children's health to what they call economy, and have to pay ten 
dollars to a doctor because they would not pay for nourishing food 
in sufficient quantity. It was said of some highwayman when he died 
(216} 



ECONOMY IN THE HOME. 217 

that after all he was not a bad fellow, for if he stole from one man 
he assisted another, and while his left hand was in somebody else's 
pocket his right hand was often relieving distress with the money 
thus obtained. Domestic economy is practised in much the same 
way. What the man saves by short commons of beer or whiskey 
he spends in an extra allowance of tobacco. What the good wife 
saves. by altering an old dress she invests in kid gloves or a feather. 
She will talk freely of how long she has worn the dress, but be mod- 
estly silent about the money she has wasted upon other things. She 
will give her children molasses instead of butter to economize, while 
she allows them to waste bread and meat as if they cost nothing. 
She will scold her little girl for buying candy while she has her own 
mouth full of ice-cream. So that while she thinks she is a wonderful 
manager she is often only "penny wise and pound foolish," and spends 
a dollar where she saves a cent. 

All of which is very human but very unwise, and perhaps the first 
step toward learning true economy is taken when one begins to under- 
stand what false economy is. There are young men in the stores 
of large cities whose parents in the country have tried to teach them 
economy and who really desire to practise it. But while they stint 
themselves in necessaries, such as proper food, they spend money 
foolishly upon mere luxuries which do them no good. Such young 
men never prosper, because at the end of each year they have always 
spent more than they have made, and yet very often their pinched 
and hungry looks show that they have not had comforts enough. 
They should have smoked fewer cigars and gone oftener to the sea- 
bath. They should have spent less upon new ties and more upon 
flannels. They should have drunk less lager beer and more beef-tea. 
They should not have cheated their boarding-house or the washer- 
woman to pay for tickets to the theatre, however innocent that amuse- 
ment may be for those who can afford it. 

Economy is by no means an easy habit to acquire, especially for 
persons of a generous disposition. It is very hard to have to count 
every half-dollar one spends, but at the same time it is as much a 



21 8 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

duty to provide for " the rainy day " of old age or adversity as it is 
to get fuel and warm clothing for the winter. Yet a large proportion 
of men and women when they die do not leave enough to bury them, 
and the number of charities for the relief of the aged of both sexes 
clearly shows how many thousands of persons who are too infirm to 
work for their daily bread are dependent upon others for tiie miser- 
able pittance that keeps body and soul together. It ought not to be 
so. Every child should be taught, and every man and woman should 
have learned, the honorable pride which shrinks from the thought 
of ever becoming dependent upon the charity of others. All that is 
needed is the habit of saving a little week by week and of never 
quite living up to our income. But many will say : " My income is 
only so and so. How can I possibly save ? " Our answer is : " You 
could save what you waste." " But I don't waste anything." " Yes, 
you do ; and if you are saving in one thing you are wasteful in 
another." 

Suppose, for instance, you waste only ten cents a day in bread or 
meat that you allow to be thrown away, or in candles burned unneces- 
sarily, or in any other item of household expense : you would say to the 
friend who told you that you could as well save that ten cents a day, 
that it amounted to nothing in the total, and that so long as you al- 
lowed no reckless extravagance you were practising as much economy 
as a liberal housekeeper ought, unless she wished to set an example of 
meanness. But you forget — and all waste in the home is the result 
of forgetting — that if you take care of the pennies the pounds will take 
care of themselves. You wonder, perhaps, to see a stone hollowed 
out beneath a waterfall. One day's dripping of water only wetted 
the stone, and a year's dripping did not perceptibly hollow it, but as 
an old poet remarked nearly two thousand years ago : " The drop 
of water hollows the stone, not by force, but by constantly falling." 
So it is with economy. Do you know what the ten cents a day, 
which you could easily save, would amount to at the end of fifty 
years, when it would do so much good to your children, if not to 
yourself, if you were to put it in a bank at 6 per cent, interest? It 



ECONOMY IN THE HOME. 2I9 

would amount to $g,S^4. Here is a table that shows what would be 
the result at the end of fifty years of saving a certain sum every day 
and putting it to interest every day at the rate of 6 per cent. : 

One cent saved every day at 6 per cent, in fifty years would l)e ^950

Of course, no one who is able to put by ten dollars or five dollars 
a day is under the necessity of practising domestic economy, but the 
table is useful as showing the vast increase of capital and interest in 
a course of years from the one cent, which every one could put by 
without feeling it. Baron Wilhelm de Rothschild, of Frankfort-on- 
the-Main, one of the famous firm of bankers, has an income of four 
cents a second. Four cents is not much, and a second is not much, 
yet four cents a second is two dollars and forty cents a minute, which 
is one hundred and forty-four dollars an hour, -which is three thousand 
four hundred and fifty-six dollars a day, which is twenty-four thousand 
one hundred and ninety-two dollars a week. Go on multiplying 
and you will become giddy at the amount which four cents a second 
will come to in a month, a year, ten years, fifty years. But there are 
31,536,000 seconds in each year. Put by your cents and you will 
soon have saved many dollars. 

The foundation principle of economy in the home, therefore, is to 
be saving and careful in little things, which seem nothing in them- 
selves, but which amount to a great deal when put together at the 
end of a given time. It is not economy to buy bad things because 



220 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

they are cheaper than good. It is always economical to keep up 
one's health. Children who are stinted in proper food cost more in 
the long run than those who are kept strong and well by generous 
diet. But generous diet does not mean over-feeding. Swill-milk is 
dearer than pure milk, although it may cost only half as much a 
quart. Poor meat is dearer than good meat, although it may cost 
only half as much a pound. A good housekeeper will soon learn 
how much bread, meat, milk, tea, sugar and other comforts are neces- 
sary for the household, and so be able to make a regular estimate 
and allow so much money a week for living and no more. A good 
housekeeper should keep an account book, entering every item, and 
filing every receipted bill. Every bill should be examined carefully, 
however sure one may be of the butcher's, baker's and grocer's hon- 
esty, because honesty is no guarantee against occasional mistakes in 
arithmetic. In order to avoid waste, all remainders should be utilized 
as much as possible. This is how the French poorer classes live better 
than those of other countries. They make soup of the scraps and 
bones instead of throwing them away. 

In clothing, the cheapest goods are not the most economical, be- 
cause good cloth and silk and cotton will last so much longer and 
wear so much better than bad that the difference in price is very soon 
made up. Ill-fitting clothes are always dear because they tear and 
crease, to say nothing of " looks," which ought always to be con- 
sidered. Yet people often boast of having saved a few dollars by 
buying goods of an inferior quality when in fact they lose by it, be- 
cause they will want two suits instead of one during the winter or the 
summer. 

Very few people are to be trusted to make purchases, and those 
are especially not to be trusted who think themselves great hands at 
making bargains. A man or woman goes into a store to buy one 
thing and sees another thing which is offered very cheap. , The idea 
of making a good bargain, like the propensity of the gambler to try 
his luck, is too strong to be conquered. The article they want to 
buy and which they need is bought, and with it something which 



ECONOMY IN THE HOME. , 221 

they do not want, and which therefore is no bargain to them, how- 
ever cheap in itself. On this false notion of making bargains house- 
keepers will often buy a larger supply of some article of food than 
they want, and they only discover their mistake when they have to 
throw away what is spoiled and will not keep. The reduction of price 
which induces them to purchase more than they can use is not econ- 
omy, yet many people think that by buying " wholesale," as they 
call it, they will make a great saving, instead of which it is a "whole- 
sale " waste and loss to them. Whenever you buy anything which 
you have no use for because it is cheap, you commit an extravagance. 
It is best, therefore, before you enter a store to decide beforehand 
precisely what you are going to buy and how much money you can 
aiiford to spend. Summon up your resolution, and when you have 
bought the article you came for, do not begin pricing everything you 
see, for it is the business of the tradesman to persuade you to pur- 
chase whatever he sees you take a fancy to. Remember poor Moses 
in Goldsmith's " Vicar of Wakefield," who thought he had made a 
fine bargain for his father when he exchanged his horse for a parcel 
of shagreen spectacles, and beware of bargains if you wish to practise 
economy. 



LIFE AT HOME. 



' Domestic happiness, thou only bliss 
Of paradise that has survived the fall ! "■ 



-Cowper. 



' The first sure symptom of a mind in health 
Is rest of heart and pleasure felt at home."- 



■ Young. 




j^OW little do people think, when they speak of a home 
as happy, or the contrary, of the many influences and 
circumstances which combine to make it so. It is 
more difficult to describe a happy home than an un- 
^^kV''' happy one, because while one single obstacle or defect 
will suffice to mar the perfection of any home, a great number of 
advantages and good points may fail to make it happy. Every 
member of a family may be in sound physical health ; there may be 
abundance of all the necessaries and even comforts of life ; the prop- 
erty or income of the father may be a certain one, so that the grim 
shadow of want cannot cause apprehension of poverty in the future, 
and yet with all these ingredients of contentment and prosperity the 
home may be far from a happy one. One virtue will not make a 
perfect or consistent character, but one vice will mar any number of 
virtues. So in the home, one disturbing element will mar the har- 
mony of the whole. Any one member of a family may blight the 
peace and happiness of the entire household. 

Take the case of an ungovernable temper. Everybody is liable 
in turn to be the unfortunate occasion or victim of it. The fire of 
home may burn ever so brightly and all the surroundings be ever so 
cheerful and cosy, and as one peeps in and sees one girl at the piano 
and another at her knitting, or one brother readincr aloud some de- 
lightful story or poem while the others listen, one would fancy that 

(222) 



LIFE AT HOME. 223 

here at all events peace and good will, mutual help and affection had 
made their dwelling upon earth. One, perhaps, is telling an experi- 
ence which has happened to the speaker during the, day, and, as it 
is comic or serious, it amuses or deeply interests the whole family 
circle. But while the tale is being told an unsteady footstep is heard 
outside the door. A father, a son, a brother, as the case may be, 
bursts into the room with flushed face and angry or incoherent 
speech, disclosing too plainly that drink is his undoing, and the peace 
and happiness of the little circle is at an end for that evening, and 
perhaps for days or weeks to come. The drunkard can make a 
wilderness of the home which else would blossom as the rose. 

But drink is not the only deadly nightshade that can poison the 
life-blood and cloud the serenity of a family. One act of dishonesty 
in any member of it may bow down a father's head and break a 
mother's heart, and make innocent sisters ashamed to appear among 
their friends. Perhaps it has not been the result of any natural ten- 
dency to theft or forgery, but has been caused by desperate losses at 
the secret gaming-table. Parents and sisters may never have had 
the faintest suspicion that anything was wrong until the detective ap- 
pears upon the scene and the criminal is arrested or makes his escape. 
In either case, the happy home is shattered like a beautiful picture or 
fragile vessel by a madman's hand. 

Sometimes an awful and mysterious destiny seems to come upon 
a home when its happiness is at the flood. What fearful tragedies 
have resulted from an unnoticed or lightly regarded brain or nervous 
trouble in some member of a family, all the rest of whom are sane 
and possessed of rationality, balance of faculties and self-control! 
What shame and humiliation may a morbidly secretive, untruthful or 
thieving child bring upon a home ! 

As a rule, such abnormal tendencies as inveracity, where the rest 
are truthful, envy, where the rest are proud of one another, and any 
other evil disposition which is not hereditary, may be eradicated and 
cured by wise and kindly treatment if taken at its earliest manifesta- 
tions. But too many parents grieve over a child's idiosyncrasies 



224 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

and never attempt to deal with them until it is too late. Example 
is not enough ; precept is not enough ; the axe must be laid to the 
root of the tree of evil tendencies as soon as it appears above the 
ground. Few human beings are incurably and irreparably bad in 
their childhood. While the heart and affections are not seared and 
dead to good influences, the vicious child can be cured. 

It is, however, of the awful fact that when one member suffers with 
some tendency or infirmity of the moral nature, all the members suffer 
with and through it, that I here remind the reader. The warnings 
of legions of angels would not be too much for such reminders. It 
is the selfish feeling that a brother or sister or child must be left to 
go their own way that ends in such wholesale misery as we see in 
many once happy homes. 

Of a really happy home the secret spring is harmony ; of an un- 
happy one, discord. The example of parents has the chief influence 
upon the conduct and future life of children. Not only are they imi- 
tative and observant, but from the dawn of thought they sit in silent 
judgment on the ways and words of their parents. For the harmony 
which makes home happy, affection and justice are two of the chief 
contributors. 

In too many families there is much affection but little justice. 
Partiality and favoritism shown by father or mother for one child at 
the cost of another is one of the most detestable of parental crimes. 
With mothers there are undoubtedly in some cases physiological 
causes for loving Jacob more than Esau from their birth. Some 
mothers take a dislike, if not a positive antipathy, for one particular 
child. The fact is recognized by all pathologists, although different 
causes are assigned for it. What is most sad to look upon is when 
the mother takes a prejudice and aversion to the ch'ild who more than 
the others, by reason of its weaker constitution or defect in any sense 
or organ, needs her tenderest love and care. There is a Cinderella 
in many households. The kitchen is for her ; the drawing-room for 
her sisters, who think themselves her " betters." The worn and 
shabby dresses are for her ; the new and costly ones for them. She 



LIFE AT HOME. 225 

is the scullion ; they are the fine ladies. Yet her heart may be the 
diamond, theirs the paste. The mother has caresses for the others, 
unmerited rebukes for her. She is the " butt " of every jest, the slave 
of every petty tyrant in the home. She does not complain of this, 
perhaps, but her heart bleeds inwardly and the warm fountain of her 
young affections is checked and frozen at its source. 

Fathers are, as a rule, less prone than mothers to this unjust dis- 
crimination. Sometimes the father interposes in behalf of the snubbed 
and persecuted child, but when his back is turned her tormentors 
treat her more cruelly than ever in jealousy of his kindly intervention, 
The pillow of the child-martyr is wet with tears ; no bright sunshine 
and spontaneous flow of happiness make flowers spring up along her 
path, and the hardest part of her lot is the reflection that the unkind- 
ness comes from the parent or sister or brother whom she loves and 
longs to cling to. 

Many parents, either from innate narrowness of moral perception 
or from those servile and tyrannic notions of parental authority and 
youthful discipline which Christians have inherited from the Jews, 
have no idea that they commit the wrong of injustice when they show 
partiality. To make the less favored child the fag and slave of the 
more favored and more selfish one, is a crime against one's own flesh 
and blood and the divine rights of children. They are not machines 
they are not insensate or passive recipients of unfair treatment. They 
know when they are unkindly spoken to without a cause and unjustly 
punished without having committed an adequate offence, and every 
stripe unjustly laid upon the child's back is an iron nail driven into 
the child's heart, and an indelible mark branded upon the child's con- 
sciousness and memory. No after petting and caressing can efface 
the wrong, remove the scar, or heal the wounded spirit. Years upon 
years may roll away ; the blow may never be repeated ; much kind- 
ness may be subsequently shown ; father and boy may never speak 
of the long past injustice; the father's memory- may have forgotten it, 
but the boy's memory forgets it never, though he forgave it long ago. 
The memory of wrong done us in childhood is ineffaceable ; it is 
IS 



226 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

never righted ; it is never obliterated. For one instance in which to 
spare the rod is to spoil the child, there are a thousand cases in which 
to use the rod unjustly is to engrave an eternal .stigma on the heart 
and to write a "minute" in the note-book of the memory which may 
be legible beyond the grave. 

Scarcely less hurtful to the child's nature and to the home life is 
petting and spoiling. Better, perhaps, is it for the boy or girl to suffer 
from neglect than pampering. Better to be punished and blamed un- 
justly than to be praised and rewarded for virtues one does not pos- 
sess and good deeds one has not done. Both treatments are alike 
unjust, and what is needed in the home is justice. 

Many children who are naturally generous and would willingly 
" share and share alike " the little windfalls of good things that come 
to them, are made selfish and greedy by the eagerness which is created 
in them by a parent's unfairness. They see every dainty, every treat, 
the first choice in every selection of presents and the tidbits of every 
delicacy, given to the mother's or the father's darling, made so, per- 
haps, because this child has a prettier complexion, a fairer skin, more 
curly hair and bolder manners than the others. The favorite has 
more pocket-money given him or her to spend; has greater care and 
cost bestowed upon dress ; is made more of before company who ad- 
mire it to please the foolish parent. Every dispute must be referred 
to the pet chicken of the little brood. At table the best seat, the 
most attention, the daintiest plateful, the ripest peach or pear. The 
other children are silent that the pet manikin or miss may talk. This 
is the privileged little egotist who may contradict papa and tell 
mamma that he knows better than she does. If a servant waits upon 
this pigmy lord in his own conceit, the man or maid is treated with 
disdain and insolence. His will is supreme in the nursery and the 
kitchen. If he is thwarted or not instantly obeyed, the domestic is 
rebuked or discharged by the fond mother, who wonders how any 
one can refuse anything to so precocious a child. 

The little brothers and sisters see all this and submit to it, but they 
are quite conscious of the injustice that prevails, and while some of 



LIFE AT HOME. 22/ 

them may be of that self-abnegating character that they easily con- 
vince themselves that there must be some superiority of worth and 
power in the one so idolized, the greater number of children feel a 
just resentment and adopt the policy of looking out for their own 
interests. This feeling, that unless they " grab " for their share th*:y 
will be left out and thrust aside, becomes implanted by degrees in an 
unselfish nature and works a great deterioration in the character. 
The care for one's self soon becomes disregard of others. The gen- 
erous bosom becomes selfish by constant contact with selfishness. 
If the character were fully formed it might not be so. Noble men 
and women can associate with the mean and churlish without becom- 
ing like them, But in the unformed mental and moral habits of the 
child, to daily witness and be the victim of injustice and selfishness, 
begets a spirit of retaliation and self-regard which would not other- 
wise exist. 

To make home happy it must be a miniature republic with equal 
rights for all. Envy and jealousy sap the foundations of home life. 
Among the boys and girls there must be a chain of mutual love, an 
anxiety for each other's happiness and welfare, a generous pride in 
each other's success. The prize at school gained by one must be the 
cause of joy to all. The industry of one must excite the emulation, 
not the envy, of the rest. The special talent of one must be respected 
by all. The sensitive spot of one must be allowed for by the others. 
Every member of the home circle should judge charitably of an- 
other's faults, knowing how much need he has of a like charity of 
judgment himself. 

We sometimes hear people say that they don't want charity from 
others, so long as they get justice. But in our thoughts and treat- 
ment of each other charity is often a part of justice. We must make 
allowances — that is charity. We must bear and forbear — that is 
charity. We must not be exact to mark what is done amiss — that 
is charity. We must do to others not as others do to us — that might 
be only justice. But we must do to them as we would that they 
should do to us — that is charity. A brother or a sister may be 



228 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

quicker in apprehension and intelligence than we are. They may 
think us very stupid and dull-witted, and they may tell us so. It is 
not kind of them, but we must judge charitably of their impatience, 
remembering how trying it is to those who see things clearly to find 
themselves unable to make them clear to others. If we are the smart 
and they the dull ones, let us remember that it is not their fault or 
our merit that made the difference between us. It is conceited and 
unjust to be offended with others for what they cannot help. Per- 
haps there is some quality in them that will awake to action some day 
which may be better than all our smartness. 

Among the members of the same family, each will have his or her 
peculiarities in mind and ways as in bodily appearance, and no two 
will be exactly alike. One will care most for this study, duty or 
amusement, and another for that. It is these diversities of gifts that 
make up the combined energy of the world, and it is these separate 
notes which blend into the harmony of home. If all the brothers 
and sisters were exactly alike in disposition, tastes, thoughts and 
aspirations, the home would have but one note, which would not be 
harmony but sameness. 

It contributes greatly to this harmony, however, that there should 
be some centre to which all the diversities which I have mentioned 
should converge. Hence the harmonizing effects of a game in which 
all can join, a pursuit in which all take an interest, a book which all 
can read aloud by turns and talk over together. In the morning 
parents and children divide and each goes forth or engages in his or 
her separate work. But in the evening and on Sundays the family 
should be together as much as possible, thus keeping warm the fires 
of sympathy and affection. When brothers and sisters are parted far 
from each other in after life, they look back fondly to these social 
gatherings when the whole family were together and there was no 
place vacant. It is this that makes the memory of old birthdays and 
Christmas days so pleasant as time goes on. It is not for the par- 
ticular holiday or evening, but because each one remembers that then 
the family were all assembled together and enjoyed life at home in 



LIFE AT HOME. 229 

To make such memories complete, to fill the canvas with an ideal 
picture of " Life at Home," many faces must be limned, many colors 
blend in the sunshine of love, many qualities of many hearts combine. 
The father, perhaps long dead, must be there, presiding over, and 
revered as well as beloved by all. Justice as well as mercy must be 
written on his brow and remembered in his acts. The mother must 
be there, loving her children with an equal love, and not helping her 
smooth-tongued Jacob to supplant his rougher but more honest 
brother Esau. Rebekah was a bad mother, and designing mothers 
generally are not good for much. Too often they implant .hatred 
between brothers by their unjust favoritism, where there would other- 
wise be brotherly affection. Sisters and daughters must be there, 
one loving her music, another painting, another flowers and garden- 
ing, another languages and reading best. Out of their several tastes 
and above them like a canopy must be their love for each other, which 
began with their first feelings and can never be extinguished by time 
or absence. Brothers must be there, now parted in the race of life, 
but who played and worked together in the days of childhood, and 
gave each his contribution to life at home. Perhaps, an aged grand- 
father or grandmother is remembered, whose gray heads were crowns 
of glory in the .sweet home picture. And the baby brother or sister 
may be there, who left the world before its eyes had seen it so as to 
know even dimly in an infant's dream where and what it was. 

"The baby wept; 
The mother took it from the nurse's arms. 
And hushed its fears, and soothed its vain alarms, 
And baby slept. 

" Again it weeps, 
And God doth take it from the mother's arms. 
From present griefs, and future unknown harms, 
And baby sleeps." 

The dead brother or sister, baby, child, or youth, is sometimes a sad, 
sweet memory in the picture of Life at Home. 

The cradle, the nursery, the library, the kitchen, health and sick- 



230 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

ness, pleasure and pain, unions and partings, tears and laughter, 
pastimes and studies, hopes and aspirations, talents and tempers, for- 
bearance and little quarrels which are so easily and so much better 
avoided, mornings and evenings, school-days and holidays, arts and 
sciences, hurts and healings, likes and dislikes, justice and injustice, 
charity and severity, all these various states, scenes and ingredients 
make up the picture of life at home. Virtue and intelligence make 
the life at home beautiful, Love is the guardian angel of it. Vice 
spoils the picture. Cruelty, injustice, envy, malice, hatred, lying, 
selfishness, make life at home a hell instead of a heaven, and old men 
and women shake their heads mournfully as they tell the younger 
folks around them that theirs was not a happy home. Few spectacles 
are more piteous than that of an ill-treated son or daughter gazing 
on the dead face of a stern, tyrannical and unjust father or mother, 
and thinking, with a tear and sigh of remembered affection and present 
forgiveness, that if "poor father" or "poor mother" had only dealt 
more justly and less harshly with them, this or that calamity would 
not have happened and the old life at home might have been other 
than it was. For love sweetens everything and makes all duty 
pleasant and all hardships bearable. Without it the palace is haunted 
with demons ; with it the hut is tenanted by angels. 

" In palaces are hearts that ask, 

In discontent and pride, 
Why life is such a dreary task. 

And all good things denied ; 
And hearts in poorest huts admire 

How Love has to their aid 
(Love that not ever seems to tire) 

Such rich provision made." 

Whether in palace, mansion, or cottage, in crowded cities amid the 
incessant roar and traffic of the busy world, or in the country village, 
a world in miniature, whose news and gossip have seemed more im- 
portant than the fate of empires, home life is the life that has been 
most real to us, whose joys have been the dearest, whose sorrows the 



LIFE AT HOME. 23 1 

keenest. The world may be a '' stage and all the men and women 
merely players," but home life is a reality to every one of us, mak- 
ing us what we are in feeling if not in fortune. In other chapters of 
this volume the separate phases and component parts of home life 
are considered. Of life at home as a whole, when we view it as a 
picture of the past, the memory and imagination of each reader must 
fill up the scenes and circumstances. Of life at home as a present 
reality to every one, if it be a happy one, full of flowers and sunshine, 
let us thank Heaven for it and guard it well. If it be unhappy, let 
each of us honestly consider what share he or she may have had in 
making it so, and what remedy or reformation is still within our powei 
so that it may be life at home indeed. 




HOUSEHOLD ORN/MENT/ITIOH. 

" Infinite riches in a little room." 

, ARGE BAGS to place slippers in for parties, or to carry 
rubbers or waterproof to opera or theatre, are made 
of gray, brown, or stone color, with a monogram em- 
broidered, braided, or outlined in the centre. 

Antimacassars are now called chair backs, and some 
of the new ones are made in coarse toweling embroidered and cut to 
the shape of the chair like a hood, so that they can be slipped over 
the back. 

No material is too common to be a medium for ornamentation. 
If you have any old worn-out hassocks, procure some green or crim- 
son baize, and on this work at intervals aflenj' de lis or any blossom, 
in a neutral tint, and then cover the old hassock with the same, 
putting any additional stuffing beneath where required. 

A sheet of unbleached cotton can be easily converted into a quilt 
by lining and binding it to the depth of six inches with Turkey red 
twill ; cover the sheeting with a trellis, work in green crewel wool, 
worked in outline, the diamonds about six inches long, and at each 
insertioH work also in outline a bunch of cherries. It will both 
look and wash well. 

Pincushions, to be hung on gentlemen's looking-glasses, are 
made of swan-skin in the shape of a rabbit, and well stuffed. For a 
lady's toilet-table there are two new shapes — one like a gypsy ket- 
tle, supported on three sticks, covered with ribbon, the kettle being 
represented by a round satin cushion, bordered with ribbon ruching; 
also a high back chair, the seat, the cushion, which lifts up and forms 
(232) 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 233 

a receptacle for studs, earrings, etc. This is made in card-board, and 
covered with pink calico and muslin. 

Among the latest notions in short blinds is a piece of white woven 
transparent material, stretched across the glass, and nailed all around 
the window frame ; also Japanese crape squares having lace inser- 
tion between. These are not, however, as effective as the transparent 
gauze pictures, with gold thread interwoven with the ground work 
(which may be either black or white) ; birds, trees, and flowers 
standing out boldly upon them. 

Work-baskets may be decorated in novel fashions. In lieu of 
quilted satin linings inside, and bands of embroidered serge outside, 
with numerous tassels depending, of all shades, the exterior of the 
basket is left unornamented, and the inside is merely plainly lined 
with holland. On this holland on one side is a large sunflower, lily, 
or any other flower that is deemed suitable, worked in crewel. If the 
basket is of the square form, with a lid, holland is still used and ar- 
ranged as pockets, on each of which a flower is worked. Many of the 
newest work-baskets are simple squares of buckram, bordered with 
ribbon wire, and bent so that the two corners meet at the handles; 
these are worked with sprays of flowers in gold thread. The wicker 
baskets on stands have their contents hidden by charmingly worked 
covers. The reversible satin sheeting is a favorite material for these ; 
any conventional design is worked on this. 

A serviceable cover to throw over a lounge or couch in the sitting- 
room is made by taking a broad, bright stripe of cretonne; on each 
side of this put a stripe of black or dark brown cloth (line it to give 
body to it) ; on each edge put a row of fancy stitches in silk or 
crewel ; the ends may be finished with fringe or not, as you choose. 

Aprons which are very useful in the kitchen are made of ticking; 
get one yard; put a band on as for any apron, then turn it up at the 
bottom for a quarter of a yard, or even more, on the right side ; fas- 
ten each end securely, and in this pocket the clothes-pins can be 
carried or used with ease. 

Wall-baskets have two bows of ribbon on them, one placed in the 



234 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

centre of the flat part that is fastened to the wall, and the other on the 
projecting part. This large bow is broad, and fuller than the other, and 
has a cluster of fruit or flowers in the centre. Little remnants of plain 
or shaded ribbon can be cut into lengths of seven inches or eight 
inches, and four inches to five inches wide, edged at each end with 
lace, gathered up, with one or two rows of "'gauging" in the centre, 
and converted into pretty ornaments for the front of the baskets. Mus- 
lin can be made up in the same way. Scraps of colored sateen can be 
mounted over double pieces of card-board cut into the form of a min- 
iature fan> then joined together to hold pins. These fans can be of 
various sizes, and the divisions are marked by gold or colored silk. 
A small floral design can be worked or painted on. The pins are 
put in all round the edge. Other pin-cushions of old-gold satin, 
mounted in the same way over card-board, in the shape of Maltese 
crosses, with a small one worked in red silk in the centre, and pins 
put in all round, are also novelties. 

For woven silk curtain bands and table spreads, collect every scrap 
of silk, whether new or old, pretty or homely, about the house. If 
you have light silk dresses you can have them colored at a dyer's 
any color you wish. It matters not how small the piece is, they will 
color it for you at small expense. Then cut them in small strips, a 
quarter of an inch wide — it is a mistake to cut them too wide, some 
use them half an inch wide — then sew them carefully together the 
same as for carpet-rags. The stripes may be shaded from light to 
dark with a " hit-or-miss " strip in the centre, or the whole strip may 
be "hit-or-miss," and may be made much handsomer by care being 
taken in sewing the strips together. Whether the strips are straight 
or bias, or cut from a circle, they can be sewn together and woven 
just the same. Weigh the balls and when you have eleven pounds 
of silk send them to a weaver. The usual price for weaving is 
twenty-eight cents per yard. This will give eight yards of material 
thirty-five inches wide. The woof is usually of linen thread and is 
scarcely visible; but if the silk is very nice and a particularly hand- 
some article is desired, silk woof is the most desirable, embroidery 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 235 

or knitting silk being used. These bands are used for curtain val- 
ances, long curtains, or portieres; for mantel valances, chair stripes, 
table scarfs, etc. Square table covers can also be worn in this way, 
the edge finished with a handsome netted silk fringe. These woven 
stripes and covers are very handsome, and will well repay one, even 
if they have to buy ribbons to help fill out the stripes. Ribbons are 
so cheap now, especially those that are a little out of style, and the 
wide ones can be cut into many strips. This material when finished 
is really handsome, falling in heavy, rich folds, and it will wear ad- 
mirably. Woollen goods woven in the same manner make admirable 
rugs and foot-mats, coarse and rough garments being utilized for the 
latter. 

A useful and pretty gift is a long strip of satin cloth to hang 
against the wall, with a succession of pockets, all embroidered with 
birds, butterflies, and daisies. 

Perfume sachets may be made by taking pieces of bright-colored 
silk or ribbon, four inches long and two inches wide, sew up two- 
thirds of the length and put narrow lace on the edge, fill them with 
cotton sprinkled thickly with perfume powder, trim with bows of 
narrow satin ribbon and paste a small embossed picture on each 
one. These are pretty for children. 

To crystallize grasses and flowers, dissolve six ounces of alum in 
one quart of water, and boil until dissolved ; then steep the grasses 
or flowers in the solution while hot. If, by the time the water is cold, 
the crystals are too large, then add more water. Separate the little 
branches gently, taking off" the superfluous lumps. Fern leaves, 
oats, flax and the long feathery grasses are the most beautiful for 
crystallizing. 

To press flowers, gather the flowers to be pressed when the dew 
has quite dried off" from them, and before the sun has become so 
warm as to wilt them. Put them between newspapers or any other 
porous papers, and place them under a press. Change them every 
day to fresh paper until they are dried. All the thin-leaved flowers 
will be found best to use for this purpose. 



236 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

The long " catkins," or pampas plumes, now so fashionable every- 
where, can be arranged in large bunches, the long stems tied once 
or twice with bright ribbons. They are placed in a blue ginger 
jar, and make a pretty decoration in a hall or a corner of a room. 

In hanging-baskets, one of the prettiest styles is made by taking a 
common horse muzzle, made of wire, and have it painted, with oil 
colors, green. Then, when dry, take large pieces or sheets of the 
bright green moss, which abounds in the woods and by the roadsides 
in the spring, and line the inside with it, letting the green side be 
turned outward. Then fill up the centre with earth and plant your 
vines and flowers, three cords being fastened to the top wire at regular 
distances, by which it is to be hung up. It can be watered occasion- 
ally, and the moss freshened by dipping it into a bucket of water. 
Another variety is the rustic style, so popular and beautiful. In 
order to make one of these, procure from the woods a number of 
crooked branches and rough, knotty twigs. Put them to soak in hot 
water, or steam them, so as to render them perfectly pliable. Get 
one of the turned wooden bowls, such as are to be found in house- 
furnishing stores ; stain it with some of the brown staining materials 
or black varnish, and then bore holes or insert screw rings on the 
outside for the cords or chains to pass through. Now bend around 
the outside of the bowl one of the branches and nail it securely at 
the top edges on either side. Several pieces can be twined around in 
this way, according to one's taste, until the whole surface is covered ; 
then finish off with one around the edge for a border. When this is 
varnished it is very pretty, and the vines will, of course, be trained 
to hang over the edge. 

No picture ought to be hung higher than the height of the aver- 
age human eye when the owner of the eye is standing. It is the 
most universal rule in our houses to hang pictures much above this 
level, and they cannot be enjoyed there. If the picture is a portrait 
or it has human faces in it, its eyes should look as nearly into ours 
as possible ; and if there be no such simple guide, perhaps a good 
rule will be to have the line that divides the picture horizontally into 



HOUSKIiOLD ORNAMENTATION. 237 

equal parts level with the eye. If one starts to hanging pictures with 
the determination to place them so that they can be easily seen and 
enjoyed without stretching the neck in the least, or stooping the body, 
he will be pretty sure to do well. As people come to enjoy pictures 
and get some intellectual, spiritual nourishment out of them, they 
want them as they want their books, where they can see them and 
use them. 

Among designs for screens, usually the panel shape is preferred, 
and ciel blue, maroon, pale yellow, olive green, gray, old gold and 
black are the colors preferred. Take the silk and line it with two 
thicknesses of paper cambric. It is better to use white cambric, as a 
dark shade will sometimes be perceptible through the texture of the 
silk. Cut the lining somewhat narrower than the outside silk, place 
it on the silk, and sew up the two opposite long edges. Then turn it 
so that the seams will be inside, leaving the top and bottom edges 
raw and unfinished, and stretch it upon a drawing-board or small 
table ready to paint. If unused to the free handling of the brush, 
the worker may find it desirable to trace the outline of her design 
with faint pencil marks upon the silk. Afterward the color may be 
carefully laid on, and the design may then be enlarged or improved 
upon as desired. Water-colors are preferable in painting upon silk, 
though oil paints, if carefully put on, may also be used. Daisies, 
thistles, wheat, clover, grasses, water lilies, Cherokee wild roses, 
morning glories, scarlet cockscombs, cat-tails and Japan lilies are 
among the prettiest flower designs. Three or five peacock plumes 
carelessly grouped together, a stork, peacock or scarlet flamingo are 
among the odd designs for screens. When the painting is completed 
the silk panel must then be framed. Plush or velvet is generally 
used for the frame or border put on the top and bottom edges and 
the sides left plain. The frame is usually of a contrasting color in 
bamboo, reeds or wood. 

Very pretty work-baskets may be made of strawberry baskets, 
lined with red Turkey twill or satin, the lining forming a bag, which 
draws up at the top with a ribbon, and when open turns down over 



238 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

the basket. Two pockets are set on opposite sides of the basket 
(inside, of course), and a needle-book and straps for holding scissors, 
thimbles, etc., are fastened to the others. 

As the season approaches when the fires are about to die out, there 
comes up the question of fireboards, or some means of replacing the 
cheerful glow of the hearth. One of the prettiest ways is to cut out 
of black net the shape of a peacock's tail and mount it and then cover 
it with the feathers of the peacock, which are now so happily intro- 
duced into all kinds of decoration, and are" especially adapted to this 
purpose. In the centre can be placed the head and breast of the bird 
itself, if possible ; if not, a bird with suitable tints, such as comes for 
millinery purposes, can be used. There are, in fact, few more beautiful 
feathers than can be found in our ordinary barnyard fowls, which 
might be saved and used in various ways. Other beautiful fireboards 
can be made of silk, linen, or any of the woollen goods which come 
for decorative purposes, and embroidered in silk and crewels. Of 
embroidery it should be urged that for effectiveness it is necessary to 
adhere to one kind of stitch, as well as to insist on tones in choosing 
color, rather than contrasts. For example, avoid using orange in 
connection with blue, but choose in preference red or green. To ex- 
plain this preference is not within the scope of this chapter ; but it is 
worth while for all persons interested in decorative work to give some 
attention to modern color schemes as against those which formerly 
prevailed. Painted screens are equally desirable. It is not necessary 
to refer to materials in regard to these, further than to mention that 
such grass matting as comes about tea chests, and ordinary coarse 
burlap, stretched and gilded, is an excellent ground to receive bold 
decoration in oils or water colors. Suitable grounds for such designs 
are cacti and flowers — sunflowers, hollyhocks and other large-petaled 
plants and foliage with brilliant coloring. The banneret adapts itself 
nicely to the use of the fireboard, and has the advantage of serving 
as a screen in winter. The standard can be purchased of gilded 
bronze, in itself very attractive, or can be made out of wood by any 
carpenter who has a lathe. This consists of an upright on legs or 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 239 

with a solid base, and a cross-bar nicely finished at the ends. This is 
the foundation for whatever the skill of the individual can produce. 

Still another purpose to which the ubiquitous Japanese fan is 
applied is that of serving as a foundation for a wall-pocket. Cover 
one side with silk or satin, and above this sew a full, flat pocket, con- 
cealing the stitches along the edge under a ruche of satin ribbon or 
pinked silk. Fasten a bow of ribbon or a cluster of flowers in the 
centre of the pocket, and bore a hole in the handle, through which 
pass a string to form a loop by which to hang the pocket. Finish by 
adding a knot of ribbon tied around the handle, to hide the loop. 

Sachets for bureau drawers and boxes can be made of pieces of 
silk merino or muslin. Take a piece of silk eight inches long and 
two and one-half inches wide. Double and sew sides together ; fill 
with aromatic herbs, if you have any ; if not, your druggist will fill 
for a trifle. Fill to within an inch and one-half of the top ; then sew 
across, draw up and fasten. Tie a ribbon around with bow. Sew 
lace or fringe all around sachet. 

Economical mats,. for use in front-doors, fireplaces, bureaus, stands, 
etc., may be made of coffee-sacking, cut to any desirable size, and 
worked in bright worsted or Germantown wool. Any simple pattern 
may be used, or it may be entirely filled in with a plain green. The 
edges of the sacking may be fringed by ravelling. To give it weight, 
line with an old piece of carpet or heavy cloth. 

To paint on velvet, use any of the ordinary non-corrosive pig- 
ments or liquid colors thickened with a little gum. Preference 
should be given to those that possess the greatest brilliancy and 
which dry without spreading. Stretch your silk as you would for 
water-color drawing. Take your water-color and mix with thin 
solution of gum-arabic to prevent from rubbing off". To paint on silk 
with oil-color, a sizing is necessary to prevent the oil from spreading. 
Take the white of an egg and whisk. Soak the silk thoroughly with 
the egg, then wipe dry with a piece of white silk, stretch tightly on 
frame, and when dry paint as in water-color. 

Pretty stand covers can be made of brown Turkish towelling and 



240 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

bright worsted braids. A lovely one is made as follows : Baste two 
inches from edges brown worsted braid and cat-stitch with gold- 
colored silk ; one and a half inches above that, scarlet braid cat- 
stitched with black silk ; and one and a half inches above that, brown 
again ; finish with fringe to match. 

Often would we recover some of our old, faded chairs, but dare 
not attempt it, lest we make, in our inexperience, a sorry job. A 
few hints on the subject will enable the most timid to become with 
success their own upholsterers. The nails must first be drawn from 
the old cover, and this is best accomplished by first loosening them, 
placing a screwdriver or chisel against their sides and hammering 
them. When the old cover has been removed, lay it over the new 
material, and cut the latter carefully out, making all the slits and 
markings with pins where the arms are to come, so that in placing it 
on the chair it will not be drawn either to the one side or the other. 
There are three pieces — one for the bottom, one for the back, and the 
third for the outside and back part of the chair. For buttons, 
button-moulds covered with the material used for the chair would do, 
but the prunella or velvet buttons, which all the upholsterers have, 
are better. After carefully placing the piece cut out for the seat of 
the chair over it and fitting it exactly, begin to button it down. Take 
a long mattress needle, thread it with string, and push it from the 
under side of the chair up in the place which marks the position of 
the old button through the new cover. Then force the button on the 
needle and twine, and pass the needle down again through the cover 
one-eighth of an inch from where it came up ; pull the twine very 
tight, and tie in a tight knot. A knot used by the trade, which is 
better, is made by holding one end of the string in the left hand, 
passing the twine under and through the .loop from the under side. 
This knot will run up close, and can be tied fast without slipping. 
The corner must be folded by the buttons, and made to lie smoothly. 
After the buttons are all fastened, nail on the cover of the back, pin- 
ning it to keep it in place, and button it down in the same way. Pin 
the outside of the back on, which requires no tufting, and nail it 



' HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 24 1 

smoothly with the tacks quite close together, turning a little of the 
material under to make it stronger. The braid is put on last of all, 
and can be either tacked on with gimp tacks or sewn. If it is sewn, 
the needle used is shaped like a crescent. And now ouf chair is 
finished, and will quite pay for the trouble. 

Nothing is better to clean silver with than alcohol and ammonia. 
After rubbing with this, take a little whiting on a soft cloth and 
polish. Even frosted silver may be easily made clear and bright in > 
this way. 

A pretty pincushion is made of three pieces of woollen three 
inches square ; sew together and fill with bran or flannel clippings, 
and crochet an edge around the seams ; crochet a cord and tassels to 
hang up by. 

Very pretty moss frames for engravings or photographs may be 
made of moss that is found on the bark of forest trees. To make 
these frames, make stiff cardboard foundations and attach the moss 
with glue, commencing with the lightest shades of moss for the inside 
edges of the frame, and the darkest for the outer edges. 

Colored sheeting looks well for a carriage rug, if a large mono- 
gram is worked in the centre and a spray of flowers in each corner, r 
Brown Holland, bound around with red or dark-blue braid, should 
be worked in all one color, or chintz flowers may be arranged all 
around and* appliqued on ; or if a design of flowers and leaves are 
worked upon a wide band of blue, it would look well ; the blue to be 
stitched to the carriage cloth, adding long stitches on each side of the 
band ; they should be " spikey " stitches, which are easily worked and 
very effective if done in some bright color. 

Inexpensive and very pretty tidies can be made of ticking, bright 
Germantown yarn and the gay borders of print. Take the print and 
sew on one strip in the centre of the ticking, and unless the tidy is 
very large a strip on each side will be sufficient. With the wool, or 
zephyr, if it is preferred, work in the white stripe, coral or feather 
stitch. Tie a fringe in the ends, of the same yarn used in working 
the tidy. The brown figured towelling is also very pretty and durable ; 

l6 



242 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

work the figures with zephyr of all different shades and finish with 
fringe; or, if preferred, ravel out the ends and overcast with the 
yarn. 

Now that the whisk-broom has been accommodated with holders 
of every description, its cousin, the feather-duster, is beginning to 
emerge from retirement, and occupy a place on the wall in some 
convenient corner. A case made for it which really serves to convert 
this useful article into one of ornament, is on the same plan as those 
modelled for the whisk-broom, except that it is round instead of flat. 
The lining may be either scarlet or blue satin, and both the top and 
bottom of the holder are trimmed with fancy fringe, headed by a 
ruche of satin ribbon, matching the lining in color. A band of satin 
ribbon crosses diagonally from the top to the bottom, and is caught 
in the middle under a bow. A cord and tassels fastened at the top 
serve to suspend the holder. 

A very pretty way to use ferns is to make a picture to hang in a 
window. Take two pieces of glass of the same size and as large as 
you wish the picture to be. Try to select them as clear and free from 
blemish as possible. Upon one of these arrange some of the finest 
■ and prettiest of the pressed ferns. A few tiny shells can be put 
among them, and bright-hued butterflies, in such a way as to seem 
poised upon the leaves. Some moss, such as can be found anywhere 
in the wood, upon stumps or fallen trees, can be placed at the place 
where the stems come together, and some little red berries stuck in 
it. When fairly arranged fasten each separate piece to the glass 
with a drop of gum arable, which is colorless and does not affect the 
ferns. Do not use mucilage. When dry and secure, place the other 
glass over and fasten the edges by a tape gummed on of exactly the 
width of the two glasses joined. A pretty finish over that is a bind- 
ing of silver paper extending over the edges upon the glass on each 
side. This is not necessary if the picture is put in a light frame in 
order to suspend it. If the frame is not used, then holes must be 
drilled in the glasses for a cord before the picture is made. 

When selecting a place to hang a thermometer, remember, in the 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 243 

first place, the temperature of the wall of any building at any hour of 
the night or day is not the true temperature of the circulating air, 
and is of no use to science. A wooden wall will radiate its heat 
more rapidly than a brick or stone, and the amateur scientist who 
hangs his thermometer on a wooden wall can force his mercury 
down below the amateur who selects a brick wall. The proper way 
to expose your thermometer is to surround it with a light wooden 
frame, covered with slats, like shutter-work, and roofed over. This 
will protect it from the direct rays of the sun and reflected heat. Run 
a light wooden bar across the centre of your shelter, to which you 
can attach the thermometer, which should be, when properly ex- 
posed, on the north side of the building, and at least one foot from 
all surrounding objects. If these directions are followed, erroneous 
reports of extreme cold weather will not find their way into print so 
often. 

To make a case for overshoes, take one-half yard square of leather 
cloth, line with thin flannel and bind around with worsted braid. 
Place two pockets inside diagonally, twelve inches long, twelve and 
a half broad, line with leather cloth, flannel outside. Around the 
edge of the case and pockets put narrow serpentine worsted braid 
and fasten with yellow floss. To fasten the case, tie each corner in 
the centre, or roll and fasten with a button and loop, first turning the 
two points and tying to keep the shoes in place. 

If tablecloths, napkins, and handkerchiefs are folded an inch or 
two beyond the middle they will last much longer; it is on the edges 
of folds where they first wear, and not folding them on a middle line, 
each ironing, they get a new crease. 

A charcoal sketch may be preserved by brushing the back of the 
drawing with a spirit varnish-, made of one-third of an ounce of white 
lac dissolved in one half-pint of alcohol. 

Brown paper of the darkest shade and thickest texture, and gray 
paper of a cool granite tint, are just now much in demand as mate- 
rials for painting upon for dadoes, panels, cornices, book-covers, and 
other things. They give a background on which the light ami

shade are at once relieved; and while gray paper is the softest, 
brown paper, partly by the contrast of its rough surface, gives the 
most relief The best brown paper for the purpose is the stout, con- 
tinuous kind used by paper-hangers and upholsterers for backing. 

Salad oil bottles make very good vases. Remove the straw 
work and cover with two coats of black paint; paste on them scrap 
pictures of flowers, butterflies, ferns, etc.; varnish well and tie bows 
of bright ribbon round the neck or a band of gold paper. If small, 
common flower-pots are covered with the black silhouettes frequently 
seen in illustrated papers and German books, and afterward var- 
nished and suspended by cords, they will form unique hanging-bas- 
kets for ferns and vines. 

A novel hanging-basket may be made as follows : Among trees 
that have just been felled some may be found with slender trunks. 
Cut a piece from one of these about a foot long, more or less, as you 
care, remove the bark, saw off the top flat on the lengthy side and 
scoop out the interior, leaving about one inch or less of thickness on 
the sides and bottom ; paint of a brown color and varnish ; tack on 
the sides either a chain, ribbon, or card to hang it by; fill the trunk 
with artificial moss and flowers, and you have a hanging-basket 
unique in its way. 

The following is said to be an excellent method of fastening cloth 
to the top of tables, desks, etc. : Make a mixture of two and a quar- 
ter pounds of wheat flour, two tablespoonfuls of powdered resin, and 
two tablespoonfuls of powdered alum; rub the mixture in a suitable 
vessel, with water, to a uniform, smooth paste; transfer this to a 
small kettle over a fire, and stir until the paste is perfectly homogene- 
ous, without lumps. As soon as the mass has become so stiff that 
the stirrer remains upright in it, transfer to another vessel and cover 
it up so that no skin may form on its surface. This paste is applied 
in a very thin layer to the surface of the table; the cloth, or leather, 
is then laid and pressed upon it, and smoothed with a roller. The 
ends are cut off after drying. If leather is to be fastened on, this 
must first be moistened with water. The paste is then applied, and 
the leather rubbed smooth with a cloth.

Old photographs of the fancy kinds may be used advantageously 
by pasting them on screens or lampshades, and subsequently glazing 
them. 

Cone frames are easily made, and the materials are within the 
reach of all. The foundation is of heavy paste-board and the various 
materials are secured with glue. Cone scales are placed around the 
outer and inner edges, and the centre of the frame may be filled with 
acorns, the centre of cones, which look like little roses, beech-nut 
hulls, small twigs and the various nuts and seeds formed into flowers 
to represent a continuous wreath. The frame must be cut to fit the 
picture and may be of any width desired; the back must also be of 
card-board, and then the glass and picture placed between the front 
and back, and the two sewed together, after which the frame may be 
decorated as above. 

A lovely pair of "curtains may be made of ordinary fine muslin, 
curtains on which may be tastefully grouped birds, flowers, Watteau 
shepherds and shepherdesses, or graceful ferns, peacocks, oriental 
foliage, and bright-hued butterflies cut from cretonne. Cretonne may 
be purchased in great variety of styles, but too many subjects should 
not be introduced into one piece of work. The flowers, etc., a-re 
appliqued on, and worked up in colored filoselles. The result of 
this work is very graceful if the design is carried out in an Unstudied 
manner, and has always the charm of novelty. 

A pretty three-fold screen may be worked on dull blue English 
serge in crewels. On one panel might be a bird-nest and birds on 
a branch, upon the next, wjld roses and butterflies, and on the third, 
a bouquet of lilies or marguerites. 

Waste-paper baskets, work-baskets, or rush-baskets for shopping, 
make a pretty and inexpensive present. Lace ribbon in and out 
through the rushes, put a bow on the front and fasten in a bunch of 
acorns, either natural or manufactured of silk and chenille. If the 
natural ones are used, take a piece of fine wire and fasten to the stem 
of the acorn, and you can easily arrange them in any way to suit your 
taste. They are very ornamental when bronzed, but may be used 



246 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, HFE AT HOME. 

when in a state of nature, just as they were picked up in the woods. 
To bronze them get a few cents' worth of bronze powder at a 
drug store, mix it with varnish and apply with a soft cloth. The 
powder must be used very soon after mixing with the varnish, or it 
will harden so that it will be impossible to use it successfully. 

Easels are so general in drawing-rooms where engravings and 
water-colors accumulate, that it is, the fashion to cover old ones with 
velvet, adding ornamental silk tassels to the top and to the lowest of 
the set of holes which support the ledge. The covering is not diffi- 
cult to manage. The velvet requires tacking first, and then sewing, 
where the stitches will be most invisible, with fine but strong black 
thread. Where the holes are, cut the circle in four, saturate the in- 
side of the velvet with strong gum, and press the pieces well down 
with the wooden pin. 

A bouquet of cut flowers may be preserved fresh in vases by put- 
ting a handful of salt or a piece of charcoal in the water, to increase 
its coldness. If put under a glass shade, or vase, where it can be 
excluded from the air, it will keep a long time. 

For watch and jewelry cases, select some smooth, unbroken pine 
chips and cut them into heart-shaped leaves; have a circle of card- 
board to which you have fastened either a standing wire or stick, 
intended for the bouquet-handle; then glue your pine leaves upon the 
card-board like a rose, three or four ply; upon this place a piece of 
card-board cut in points, that you have first lined with silk or velvet 
and edged with beads. This is for the jewelry. Make a bouquet of 
chips; ornament with stitches of silk, or touch with water-colors; in 
the centre of the rose glue a second velvet-covered receptacle for the 
watch; tie the bouquet to the bouquet-handle. A chain of gilt beads 
connects the watch-case to the jewelry-case on each side. A coat 
of white varnish preserves and improves the chip-work. This must 
be applied with a hair-brush. When made it is beautiful. Those 
in possession of fine large shells can obtain beautiful jewelry -cases by 
having them mounted on carved pedestals, either of wood or metal. 
Another way to mount these shells is to have them supported on 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 247 

each side by dragons or other mythological subjects, but this style 
is more costly. 

A nice knife and fork case may be made of wash-leather and flan- 
nel or cashmere. For the inside, cut a piece of wash-leather twenty 
inches wide and twenty-four inches long, shaped at one end with the 
corners cut off; then cut a similar piece in cashmere or flannel and 
ornament with a cross-stitch border all round : bind the leather and 
cashmere together with a narrow ribbon. Sew a strip of embroidery 
down the centre of the inside, stitching it across at intervals to form 
loops through which to pass the knives, etc. The two pieces fold 
over the sides, and the case is fastened with a strap and button. 

Tobacco pouches are made of soft kid, cut in a circle and bound 
with ribbon, embroidered in colored silks with a floral design and 
monogram, or Panama or Russian canvas, lined with India-rubber 
cloth. 

Flat-bottomed chairs can be made to look nicely by first taking a 
strip of strong cloth as wide as the chair seat, and twice the length, 
pass it under the chair and sew it tightly together on the top ; then 
cut a pattern exactly fitting the chair and cover with rep, cretonne, or 
chintz. Finish with a border of the same about three inches wide. 
Very good covers can be pieced log-cabin style and finished with a 
valance of woollen goods pinked around the edge. 

A much-used room, where the wall-paper is likely to be marked 
by chair backs, etc., can be made neat and pretty by a dado of col- 
ored matting, which comes in a variety of block patterns and shades, 
and of various widths. Even the ordinary red and white matting 
makes a good finish tacked up to the wall, with brass, or silver, or 
invisible tacks; and there are larger delicate checks in greens, and 
yellow, and brown mattings that combine beautifully with pale wall- 
papers. 

Autumn leaves or ferns arranged on thin silk, and covered with 
transparent muslin with pinked edge, are lovely ; and pretty shades 
are made of lace lined with colored silk and edged with fringe. 

An easy way to make zephyr balls is as follows: has any one ever 



248 THli HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

made worsted balls on a fork? It is a great deal easier and quicker 
way than cutting out pieces of card. Wind the worsted around the 
fork ; be sure and wind considerable, so as to have the ball full ; 
then tic tightly through the centre of the fork with the cord ; cut the 
worsted on two sides of the fork, then finish by trimming it to its 
proper shape. 

To make a pretty trimming of feather-edged braid take the braid and 
crochet a heading on one side, then a pretty edge of crochet on the 
other, making it wide or narrow, as you like, using medium-sized thread. 

The little Japanese parasols, which can be bought for four or five 
cents, make very pretty hair receivers. Open them about half their 
extent ; if necessary to make them stay half open, catch them with 
a few stitches. Put a loop of ribbon around the handle and hang 
them up. 

Chain stitch is now but little used in embroidery, although it may 
sometimes be suitable for lines. It is made by taking a stitch from 
right to left, and before the needle is drawn out the thread is 
brought round towards the worker, and under the point of the needle. 
The next stitch is taken from the point of the loop thus formed for- 
ward, and the thread again kept under the point of the needle, so 
that a regular chain is formed on the surface of the material. This 
chain stitch was much employed for ground patterns in the beautiful 
gold-colored work on linen, for dress or furniture, which prevailed 
from the time of James I., to the middle of the eighteenth century. 
It gave the appearance of quilting when worked on linen in geomet- 
rical designs or in fine and often-repeated arabesques. Examples 
come from Germany and Spain in which the design is worked in 
satin stitch, or entirely filled in with solid chain stitch in a uniform 
gold-colored silk. Twisted chain or rope stitch is effective for out- 
lines on coarse materials, such as blankets, carriage rugs, footstools, 
etc. It is like an ordinary chain, except that, in place of starting the 
second stitch from the centre of the loop, the needle is taken back to 
half the distance behind it, and the loop is pushed to one side to 
allow the needle to enter in a straight line with the former stitch. It 



HOUSEHOtD ORNAMENTATION. 249 

is not of much use except when worked with double crewel or with 
tapestry wool, and should then have the appearance of a twisted 
rope. 

A pretty mat for the floor and one that will cost little is made of 
burlap worked in cross stitch with different colored worsteds. There 
is no pattern or design, but use the odds and ends of zephyrs that 
you happen to have left from other fancy work, and let them come 
haphazard. The effect is very unique. If any one cares to spend 
time upon it, a centre piece and border may be worked and then filled 
in as first suggested. Line the mat with a piece of carpet or new 
ticking, and finish it with fringe, or a bright-colored flannel strip 
cut in scallops. Worsted fringe which has been worn upon a dress 
and put away may be used for this purpose, and if it is dark-colored 
brighten it up by tying in lengths of bright worsted of the various 
hues in the mat. 

A good way to keep the earth moist in a hanging-basket without 
the trouble of taking it down is to fill a bottle with water and put in 
two pieces of yarn, leaving one end outside on the earth. Suspend 
the bottle just above the basket, and allow the water to drip; this 
will keep the earth moist enough for winter, and save a great deal of 
time and labor. 

Pretty washstand mats may be made of white felt or flannel, bound 
with a broad band of color and large woollen stars roughly worked 
all over in the color of the binding — red, blue or pink may be 
used ; or they may be made of colored sheeting with a deep woollen 
edging. 

Skeleton leaves may be made by steeping leaves in rain-water in 
an open vessel, exposed to the sun and air. Water must occasionally 
be added to compensate loss by evaporation. The leaves will pu- 
trefy, and then their membrane will begin to open ; then lay them on 
a clean white plate, filled with water, and gently take off the mem- 
branes; separate them cautiously near the middle rib. This process 
requires patience, as some require some time to decay. Purchase 
a frame with a box six inches deep and fourteen by sixteen (width 



2SO THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

and length) ; line with black velvet. Make a wreath for the back, 
starting either side at the bottom of the box, and let them taper 
toward the top ; make this of the largest leaves. Set a small statue 
or picture in front of this wreath ; put an upright post on either side 
of this picture a little shorter than the wreath ; and towards the front 
two other smaller standards. Run white thread from back to front, 
on which glue the small leaves, and fix in any fantastical way j'ou 
choose. 

The method of executing the fashionable and pretty tapestry- 
work is one that can be learned without any difficulty, and it will 
be found very useful for very many purposes. The embroidery 
is worked in Gobelin-stitch over silver or gold braid, which closely 
covers the canvas. Each row covers two threads, and is fast- 
ened to the canvas by a few stitches at each end. The embroid- 
ery is then worked with zephyr wool in two shades of red in 
Gobelin-stitch. To do the work neatly, and avoid "puckering," 
which would otherwise follow, the canvas should be placed in a 
frame. 

Cases for brushes, combs and sponges are not hard to make, and 
useful in protecting them from dust. Brush broom cases ornamented 
with applique work, or with a monogram worked in silk, or with a 
bunch of flowers, are very pretty. 

An excellent imitation of carving, suitable for frames, boxes, etc., 
may be made of a description of leather called basil. The art con- 
sists in cutting out this material in imitation of natural objects, and 
in impressing upon it by simple tools, the same as in wax flowers. 
Begin with a simple object — an ivy-leaf, for instance. Cut the 
proper shape, and impress the veins upon it ; then arrange them in 
groups, when you have sufficient, on the frame. The tools required 
are ivory or steel points of various sizes, punches and tin-shapes. 
Before cutting out the leaves, the leather should be well soaked 
in water until it is quite pliable. When dry the leaves will retain 
their artistic shape. Leaves and stems are fastened together with 
glue, and varnished when dry, or you may varnish with sealing-wax 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 251 

dissolved in spirits of wiiie. Wire, cork, gutta-percha, bits of stems, 
etc., may severally be used to aid in the formation of groups of buds 
and seed-vessels, etc. 

There is much effort made nowadays by both ladies and gentlemen 
to collect mineral specimens, shells and curiosities for a cabinet. 
They are collected by parties exchanging their duplicates for kinds 
they do not possess. After one has been exchanging a few months 
a good collection will be secured. Those who have but a few 
specimens can arrange them by getting a wooden box which has a 
sliding cover. Remove the cover and cut out of glass one that will 
fit the box. Apply to the box the prepared liquid shoe-blacking, 
which, by using two coats, will make a good imitation of black 
ebony, or logwood chips boiled as for dyeing purposes brushed on 
and afterwards brushed over with vinegar will do full as well. 
Varnish with transparent varnish. After the exterior of the box is 
made to suit you, line the inside with red flannel by cutting out 
pieces of flannel which just fit the sides and bottom of the box ; then 
cover with glue or paste, and paste or glue the lining in. Place in 
your specimens after they have been properly labelled, the label 
giving the name, its locality where found and the donor, and here we 
have a nice miniature cabinet. A pretty ornament can be made of a 
few specimens of minerals, shells and curiosities by sawing out of 
pine a lyre twelve or fourteen inches long ; paint the wood, and after 
it is dry cover the front and side with putty. Then arrange the 
minerals, etc., on the putty after the fashion you would shell-work ; 
for strings for the lyre use knitting needles fastened into the putty ; 
fasten a strong wire on the back forming the wire in the shape of a 
large hairpin and set it up like an easel. We have seen a little work- 
box or jewelry casket made by glueing bright squares of velvet on 
the lids and sides of a small wooden box, and around the velvet 
squares various ores, shells and stones were stuck on with a cement ; 
the inside lined with silk or velvet, and when completed it formed a 
unique and pretty ornament. 

The best cheap material for portieres is canton "flannel, which is 



252 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

sold in the stores under the name of fashion drapery, for about ninety 
cents a yard. It is soft and downy, and being the same on both sides 
is admirably adapted as a hanging between two rooms. It is easy to 
trim it in such a way that it shall suit both apartments ; it looks well 
with a simple border of darker material laid on, or it may be em- 
broidered in crewels, in any conventional design. It can be bought 
in all colors and hangs in very soft and graceful folds. Portieres 
should always be sewed on to rings, and suspended from a pole, so 
that they can readily be drawn back at will. 

Seaweeds rank among the most beautiful natural objects, while the 
work of collection and mounting is delightful occupation for the 
leisure hour. The best time to collect is when the tide has just 
commenced to flow, after the lowest ebb, as the seaweeds are then in 
good condition. Mounting is done by immersing a piece of paper 
just below the surface of the water, and supporting it by the left 
hand ; the algae is then placed on the paper and kept in its place by 
the left thumb, while the right hand is employed in spreading out 
the branches with a bone knitting-needle or a camel-hair pencil. If 
the branches are too numerous, which will be readily ascertained by 
lifting the specimen out of the water for a moment, pruning should 
be freely resorted to, as much of its beauty will depend upon the 
distinctness of the branching. Pruning is best performed by cutting 
off erect and alternate branches, by means of a sharp-pointed pair of 
scissors, close to their junction with the main stem. When the 
specimen is laid out, the paper should be raised gradually in a slightly 
sloping direction, care being taken to prevent the branches from 
running together. The delicate species are much improved in 
appearance by reimmersing their extremities before entirely with- 
drawing them from the water. The papers should then be laid flat 
upon coarse, bibulous paper, only long enough to absorb superfluous 
moisture. If placed in an oblique direction, the branches are liable 
to run together. They should then be removed and placed upon a 
sheet of thick white blotting paper, and a piece of washed and pressed 
calico placed over each specimen, and then another layer of thin 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATliON. 253 



J 



blotting paper above the calico. Several of these layers are pressed 
in the ordinary way, light pressure only being used at first. The 
papers, but not the calico, may be removed in six hours, and after- 
wards changed every twenty-four hours until dry. If the calico be 
not washed, it frequently adheres to the algae, and if the calico be 
wrinkled, it produces corresponding marks on the paper. The most 
convenient sizes of paper to use are those made by cutting a sheet of 
paper, of any size, into sixteen, twelve, or four equal pieces. 

Cut-work is revived in modern artistic needlework. The patterns 
are in the quaint designs of Venice lace. A pure white or ecru linen 
is chosen. A pillow-case linen with an even thread is preferred, and 
the design to be wrought is usually stamped as a border and is oftener 
an insertion than an edge. The pattern is outlined in button-hole 
stitch and the ground of the design is then cut away and rich trac- 
ing in open work of graceful arabesques and flowers left. In many 
of the English castles there are still counterpanes and pillow-cases in 
ancient cut-work. The needlework seems naturally adapted for this 
purpose. A counterpane of this kind of work thrown over a tinted 
silk or satinet quilt would be much richer in effect than those so often 
seen in antique lace. A coverlet copied from one wrought 'by Mary 
Queen of Scots would be charmingly suggestive of Scottish romance, 
and probably tasteful, as the employment of high art in needlework 
is only the revival of an ancient practice. Small pieces, like doylies, 
are often wrought with a border of cut-work, but a rapid worker in 
button-hole stitch would hardly find a large piece of this work tire- 
some, though like all lace work it lacks the relief of color. The Eng- 
lish revival of art designs has put in the reach of every one an infinite 
number of exquisite patterns for embroidery in South Kensington 
stitch and outline work. The details of these artistic stitches are 
easily mastered by an ordinary needlewoman, but if desired, instruc- 
tion can readily be had at the classes for this purpose. A set of 
doylies is an excellent selection for a beginner. If one or two are 
spoiled in the first attempts no great loss of time is incurred, as the 
embroidery of one doylie is little work. A firm white linen is the 



254 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

material chosen, and a different design is stamped on each of the set 
The stitch used in embroidery is South Kensington. The patterns, 
which are in Japanese effect, are usually wrought in solid color with 
bobbin silk or crewels. Nodding grasses and a flight of birds, lilies, 
clusters of roses, a straying vine or scraps of sea-weed, are some of 
the pretty designs. Ceramic patterns, showing a vase, a plaque or 
teapot, are in pure Japanese style, and are worked in old Nankin blue. 
These doylies add a dainty bit of color to the after-dinner cloth, 
placed under a wineglass or a fingerbowl. The tablecloth used with 
them may be embroidered around the edge in corresponding designs, 
but often a white wine-cloth with a double border woven in old gold, 
ruby or Nankin blue, is used with doylies embroidered in a similar 
color. The new tidies are about a yard in length by half a yard in 
breadth. Soft India pongee silk is now used. The edges of the silk 
are hemstitched the desired length, and the ends are finished with 
fringe. A vine of English clematis is wrought across the tidy in con- 
ventional color to suit the room, or is embroidered with olive leaves 
and white or purple flowers. A straggling blackberry vine is often 
used for decoration. A spray of golden-rod or sunflowers would be 
selected for a room furnished in oriental yellow. Rooms in this color 
are so managed by English art decorators that they seem to be in a 
continual flood of golden sunshine. Figures in genre style are often 
wrought on tidies in outline Work, which is easily done and is very 
effective. A realistic figure is the pumpkin girl, a buxom beauty who 
bears fn her arms a sample of the yellow fruit. Though the pumpkin 
is not likely yet to be selected as an ornamental climber for garden 
trellis, the vine that strays at the feet of the girl is conventionalized 
into something like beauty, and the outline curves of the design are 
suggestive of golden October days. In an entirely different spirit is 
the slender maiden 'neath a moonlit sky " catching lunar moths." 
The short waist, short clinging skirts and fluttering scarf of the cos- 
tume are- like old English pictures of women seen in the " Scottish 
Chiefs " and books of that time, and -belong to the sentimental type 
of woman, of whom Mrs. Hemans sang and lady novelists of her daj 
wrote. 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 25 S 

Pongee silk is also used for charming little work-aprons. The 
bottom is turned up to form a pocket, and a ribbon in color is run 
through the hem at the top to fasten the apron around the waist. 
A spray of Virginia creeper and berries, or a branch of carnations, 
is embroidered in South Kensington stitch across the pocket, or a 
few long-stemmed violets are scattered over the apron. Bureau covers 
are of cream-white momie cloth. They are embroidered on the ends 
with vines and powdered through the centre with violets, pink rose 
petals or tiny blue love-in-the-nests, or scattered with rose-buds. 
The decoration and color are chosen in reference to the coloring of the 
room. Wall protectors, for the backs of washstands, are wrought in 
South Kensington stitch with crewels. A cream-white buff ecru or 
gray linen is selected with regard to the prevailing tint of the wall. 
"An aquatic scene of water grasses and floating pond lilies may be 
chosen for embroidery, and in place of the suggestive motto, " Clean 
hands and a pure heart," a flight of birds is often substituted. Sub- 
marine scenes for the same use show swimming fishes, shells, sea 
anemones and floating sea-weed. Pillow protectors or " shams " are 
of white linen, and are usually bordered by a ruffle of sheer linen or 
a frill of lace. One corner of the sham is embroidered with sprays 
of poppies or lotos leaves, and the words " pleasant dreams " or " good 
night " are wrought in English or in the homelike German language, 
in whose rough gutturals there is always a rugged sound of hos- 
pitality. 

A merino or cashmere dress may be mended neatly by wetting a 
piece of court-plaster of exactly the same shade as the goods, and 
putting it on the wrong side, pressing down every frayed edge and 
every thread, and laying a weight On it until it is thoroughly dry. 

The stitch known as the " Kensington," or " South Kensing- 
ton," and used in what is called, in a phrase of the day, " artistic 
embroidery," is as nearly as possible no definite stitch at all, but 
much like drawing done on cloth with needle and thread, a single 
thread stroke, or " stitch," representing each pencil stroke, how- 
ever long or short, only that curves, of course, can only be done 



2<^6 , THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

by a succession of short strokes of the thread. The stitches are 
mostly made in the " back-stitch " manner, and are regulated by 
no rules whatever, either as to length or direction, but by the eye 
alone, the object being to produce the effect of the design in the 
quickest way. It is done with embroidered silks or worsteds on. 
articles not intended ever to be washed ; can be made very effec- 
tive, and is not at all tedious. Any one able to use a needle and 
thread at all knows all the mechanical manipulation necessary; but 
in order to produce the beautiful designs given in the fashion or 
ladies' magazines for borders, etc., worked in this stitch, you must be 
able to copy the pattern by your eye alone, as in drawing. The 
very useful and widely adaptable embroidery stitch now called 
" Kensington outline " is different from the above, being produced 
by a succession of stitches all exactly alike. It is the best of all 
stitches for the pretty outline designs, resembling etchings, now so 
fashionable for working with colored marking-cotton on handker- 
chiefs, table-napkins, ^nd many other articles destined to form an 
intimate acquaintance with the wash-tub. These designs have no 
filling in, all that is worked being the outlines together with such 
lines as, in a pen and ink drawing, would be put in to mark the folds 
of drapery and so forth. Any one can copy a little outline picture 
on the white goods where it is to be worked, by placing the goods 
over the picture (holding against the window-pane, if necessary) and 
marking the lines with a lead-pencil ; then all you have to do is to 
follow the pencil marks with your Kensington outline. A line of 
this stitching looks on the right side like a small, twisted cord, and 
on the wrong side appears as a row of ordinary, plain hand-stitching. 
By this description many ladies will recognize Kensington outline 
stitch as only a new name for their old friend " stem " or " cord " 
stitch. It is extremely effective on even the most ordinary ma- 
terials. 

A bag for soiled clothes may be made of Macrame lace, lined with 
silk, satin, or wool goods. The lace extends only two-thirds of the 
length of the bag, and is finished with a ruche of satin ribbon. The 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 257 

bottom is completed by a handsome bow of ribbon and tassel made 
of the thread used for the Macrame lace. Draw up the bag at the 
top with silk cord and tassels the shade of the lining. Very pretty 
bags are also made of blue and white ticking, the blue stripes covered 
with black braid feather-stitched with colored wool, and the white 
stripes embroidered with bright-hued wools in as great a variety of 
fancy stitches as the maker's skill can compass. A plainer style, 
much liked by many persons who wish to have such articles fre- 
quently washed, is made of stout brown linen, trimmed with rows 
of scarlet braid, three-quarters of an inch wide, feather-stitched with 
black wool. These rows are placed an inch apart and may be 
arranged in regular order, covering the bag to half or three-fourths 
of its depth, or in three groups of four rows each, one at the bottom, 
one in the centre, and one at the top of the bag, just below the 
drawing-string, which should be of scarlet braid in place of cord and 
tassels. 

When sewing buttons on children's clothes where there will be 
much strain on the button, the danger of tearing the cloth out will 
be greatly lessened by putting a small button directly under the 
larger outside button. This applies, of course, only to buttons with 
holes through them. 

The beauty of netting consists in its firmness and regularity. All 
joins in the thread must be made in a very strong knot, and, if pos- 
sible, at an edge, so that it may not be perceived. The implements 
used in netting are a netting-needle and a mesh. In filling a netting- 
• needle with the material, be careful not to make it so full that there 
will be a difficulty in passing it through the stitches. The size of 
the needle must depend on the material employed, and the fineness 
of the work. Steel needles are employed for every kind of netting 
except the very coarsest. The fine meshes are usually also of steel ; 
but as this material is heavy, it is better to employ bone or wooden 
meshes when large ones are required. Many meshes are flat, and in 
using them the width is given. The first stitch in this work is 
termed diamond netting, the holes being in the form of diamor.L^ ,.

258 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

To do the first row, a stout thread, knotted to form a round, is 
fastened to the knee with a pin, or passed over the foot or on a hook, 
sometimes attached to a work-cushion for the purpose. The end of 
the thread on the needle is knotted to this, the mesh being held in 
the left hand on a line with it. Take the needle in the right hand, 
let the thread come over the mesh and the third finger, bring it back 
under the mesh, and hold it between the thumb and first finger. Slip 
the needle through the loop over the third finger, under the mesh 
and the foundation thread. In doing this a loop will be formed, 
which must be passed over the fourth finger ; withdraw the third 
finger from the loop, and draw up the loop over the fourth gradually 
until it is quite tight on the mesh. The thumb should be kept firmly- 
over the mesh while the stitch is being completed. When the neces- 
sary number of stitches is made on this foundation, the future rows 
are to be worked backward and forward. To form a round the first 
stitch is to be worked immediately after the last, which closes the 
netting into a circle. Round netting is very nearly the same stitch, 
the difference is merely in the way of putting the needle through 
the loop and foundation, or other stitch. After passing the needle 
through the loop it must be brought out and put downwards through 
the stitch. This stitch is particularly suited for purses. Square 
netting is exactly the same stitch as diamond netting, only it is begun 
at a corner on one stitch and increased (by doing two in one) in the 
last stitch of every row until the greatest width required is attained. 
Then by netting two stitches together at the end of every row, the 
piece is decreased to a point again. When stretched out all the holes 
in this netting are squares. Square and diamond netting are the 
most frequently used, and are ornamented with patterns darned on 
them in simple darning or in various point stitches ; in the latter 
case it forms a variety of the sort of work termed guipure. Stitches 
in netting are always counted by knots. 

Fireplace curtains are often only half a yard wide, and just long 
enough to touch the floor, but then again rep ones with a worsted 
worked border are much fuller. For stamped velveteen we should 



HOUSEHOLD, ORNAMENTATION. 259 

say from three-quarters to one yard, according to the size of the 
mantel-piece, would be enough. Dark blue, outlined with gold, will 
be very handsome ; the mantel border should be about six or eight 
inches, but it is impossible for us to say decidedly the best propor- 
tions for such things when we are ignorant of the dimensions of the 
room, or even of the fireplace. Mantel shelves now never have the 
valance put on separately from the top ; it is all one, and only the 
corners are shaped out by a seam around the mantel ends. Fringes 
are out of fashion in a great measure, and, as often as not, the border 
is only hemmed up underneath, or a cord laid along it. Chenille 
cord, or ordinary chenille like that put round glass ornament shades, 
often looks better than silk cords on velvet. 

A pretty pen-wiper is made of six pieces of flannel, two brown^ 
two red and two green, in the shape of a beech leaf Nip the edge 
of each leaf into very tiny points and chain-stitch veins upon it in 
gold-colored floss. Attach these leaves together at their upper ends 
arranging under them three pointed leaves of black broadcloth or 
silk, to receive the ink, and finish the top with a bow of ribbon. 

A very pretty srrap-bag, for sitting-room or bed-room, is made in 
a simple manner by taking a good-sized Japanese parasol, or small 
umbrella: take a piece of fine wire and make in a ring, catch it to 
the partly-opened parasol with thread, tie a bright ribbon to the 
handle. Of course, this is serviceable only for bits of paper and 
, light scraps. 

To wind a watch, turn the hole downward, and let the small end 
"of the key point upward. This will allow any little particles of dirt, 
metal or dust to drop out, and the watch will not need cleaning so 
often. 

There are many new and pretty designs for perfume and glove and 
handkerchief sachets. One for gloves may have on the back the 
half of a long kid glove, applied to satin, all the seams being elab- 
orately worked in colored silks in small flowers, with two narrow 
floral bracelets above. Another sachet has two peacock feathers em- 
broidered with silk, on a ground of pale blue satin, with a deep red 



26o THE hearthstone; or, life at home, 

ribbon attached, which is " appliqued on " with gold thread. " Bon 
jour " was worked on one end with gold letters. Just now one finds 
the legend " bon jour" painted or embroidered on all sorts of pretty 
fancy articles. Sprays of jessamine seem to be most in favor for 
painting or embroidery this season, and are pretty ornamentations for 
blotting-books of black, dark red or rich blue satin. Another blotter 
design has a simulated pen, worked slantwise, with the letters of 
a name apparently strung on ; a small spray of flowers is found 
in the corners. 

Beautiful coverings for chairs, ottomans, sofa pillows and screens, 
and drapings for tables and doors, are secured by working over the 
designs on these materials in silks and crewels. The color of the 
design beneath is immaterial, but the colors used in the embroidery 
depend upon the general tone of the ground. This embroidery is, of 
course, not closely wrought. The form is usually outlined and indi- 
cated by long stitches of various colors, giving the effect of the 
innumerable dyes used in Persian and Indian goods, and, after a 
little practice and skill in choosing the colors, can be very quickly 
done. 

To make rag rugs, cut rags and sew hit-and-miss, or fancy striped, 
as you choose. Use wooden needles, round, smooth and pointed 
at one end, of any convenient length. The knitting is done back 
and forth (like old-fashioned suspenders), always taking off the first 
stitch. 

Shoe pockets are made of about two and a half yards of calico, 
one yard of which makes the back, to be tacked to the door when 
done. Split the remaining yard and a half in two, lengthwise, and, 
placing the slips about one inch apart, make across the back three 
rows of pockets, by stitching first the ends of the strips to the sides 
of the back, and then gather the bottom of each strip to fit the back ; 
then separate each strip into two, three or four pockets, according 
to the use for which they are designed, and fasten by stitching a 
narrow "piping" of calico from top to bottom of the back betv.L :i 
the pockets. A border of leather sewed on the edges of the back. 



HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTATION. 26 1 

and a narrow strip used instead of the calico " piping," make L.-c 
whole much stronger. 

To make a case for comb and brush, take some Holland, drill or 
ticking, cut in one piece ten inches wide and twenty-five in length, 
each end turned up five and one-half inches, leaving a plain piece 
in the centre of three inches. Ornament with an embroidered vine ; 
fasten together with ribbon strings. 

A "lace album" contains either a specimen, or painted imitation of 
a specimen, of all the kinds of real lace issued since the manufacture 
of lace began. The whole of a design must be given. Fragments of 
real lace of family interest, as having been worn by remote ancestry, 
are introduced, each one being labelled with the name of the lace and 
the noted occasions on which it was worn. The album leaves are of 
satin, so as to better display the pattern. When it is possible to pro- 
cure a fragment of lace worn by some great celebrity, the autograph, 
too, is obtained if possible. 

Some little contrivances which have added much to the appearance 
and comfort of the dressing-room are as follows : When a room does- 
not happen to contain a hanging wardrobe, an excellent substitute 
may be effected by means of a set of those portable folding pegs, 
which can be bought for a very small sum, fastened to the wall by 
strong nails. But dresses and cloaks are not sightly objects when 
hung up; and if not covered, they catch the dust in a manner very 
detrimental to their preservation. Make a cretonne curtain (a light 
ground is the best) the required width and length, with several cur- 
tain rings at the top. Then procure at any hardware dealer's two 
of those little brass hooks to screw into the wall, which are used 
for hanging up cups in china closets — the largest size of these — and 
a strong piece of cane about three-quarters of a yard long. Screw in 
the hooks just over the pegs, run the cane through the curtain rings 
and fasten it up, the two hooks supporting each end. Thus a port- 
able hanging wardrobe is at once made, and when the room is swept 
nothing need be done save to turn the flowing curtain inside out and 
pin it tightly round the dresses underneath it. When there are pegs 



262 THE HEARTHSTONE,; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

behind the door the same sort of curtain can be put up and has all 
the appearance of a portiere. The cretonne should match the window 
curtains and harmonize as much as possible with the shade of the 
carpet and the whole tone of the room. Boxes and trunks, which 
never look well in a bedroom in their natural state, may be converted 
into ottomans by cretonne covers, made to fit loosely and take off 
and on. A flat piece lined for the top of the box, a piping cord round, 
and a loose flounce gathered on, is the best way to make them. And 
when curtains, box covers, portiere, and hanging wardrobes are all 
made of the same pretty light cretonne to match,. the effect is very 
good. When '" doing up " a bedroom it is well to buy as many yards 
of cretonne as you are likely to want at first, in case of not being 
afterwards able to match the pattern. Nothing looks worse than a 
" patchy " room, and the idea should be fully carried out or not 
attempted at all. 




FL0RICULTU1|E/ND H0I[TICULTU1|E. 

O improvement is more marked in the modern home than 
the prominence which is being more and more assigned 
to the cultivation of flowers. This taste is a develop- 
ment of the general sense of beauty and picturesqueness 
which is one of the best signs of a pure, healthy and 
intellectual life. A few years ago it was a rare thing to find flowers 
in the windows and on the tables of any but the wealthiest classes in 
America. Hothouse flowers were purchased by the wealthy because 
they were costly, and the more they cost the more necessary they 
were deemed. But for any but the rich, flowers were deemed little 
more than litter, or, at any rate, were not thought of as among the 
Kiost beautiful adornments and attractions of the simple home. Now 
they are prized in every household, and so universal is the apprecia- 
tion of them becoming in all English-speaking communities, that 
there are societies of benevolent ladies in almost every city for sup- 
plying hospitals and sick-rooms and the dwellings of the poor with 
flowers. •" 

Next to the necessaries of life are those little comforts to the senses 
which " adorn and cheer the way." It is wonderful how much the 
senses of sight and smell have to do with tranquillity of mind, aspira- 
tion after all that is good and noble, patience under present gloom 
and hope of future welfare. Hearing may reveal things to us on a 
grand scale. The sound of martial music may thrill the soul with 
more sudden impulse and stronger energy. But the sight and per- 
fume of flowers has a quiet power of beneficence over the feelings, 
which makes bare walls seem fairyland and " the wilderness to blos- 
som as the rose." To all thoughtful minds, they have ever been 

(26,3) 



264 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

emblems and types of qualities, virtues and blessings. The purest 
mind that ever pondered the great parable of nature saw in the lilies 
of the field a beauty which Solomon arrayed in all his glory could 
not equal. The language of flowers is a language that speaks directly 
to the heart. Even if 

"A primrose by the river's brim 
A yellow primrose was to him. 
And it was nothing more," 

it was a great deal, for the most stolid and matter-of-fact observer 
cannot take from the flowers their divine gift of beauty. No sight 
is prettier than that of children gathering wild flowers, in pure enjoy- 
ment of their beauty, in the natural gardens planted by the Father's 
hand. The love of flowers is a redeeming feature in characters other- 
wise unamiable, if, indeed, any but the amiable can love objects and 
possessions so pure and beautiful. They suggest beauty and har- 
mony, virtue and peace. They are full of what Matthew Arnold 
calls " sweetness and light." The tired sight finds rest and recrea- 
tion in the variegated colors and beautiful arrangements of a garden. 
Through the eye the fancy, and the higher faculty than fancy, imagi- - 
nation, is gently stimulated. We turn back to look again at the 
beautiful rose-bed, or the other flowers majestic, or simple and re- 
tiring, which recall to us some scene or feeling of the past. As aids 
to memory, flowers are to some minds more powerful than music. 
The familiar flower appeals through the eye as the familiar melody 
does through the ear to the memory of the past. Memory is itself a 
flower-garden where good deeds and kindly affections blossom as we 
look back. And even more vividly to the sensitive imagination are 
the happy pictures of the past recalled by the perfume than the aspect 
of a favorite flower. The air made aromatic by the flower-beds 
seems to waft us back to the days of other years, and perhaps other 
countries, where the same perfume made some special scene, event, 
or person eternal in our memory. Some one we loved may be im- 
pressed upon our remembrance chiefly by a flower. Hence there 
was true philosophy in Shakespeare's letting poor Ophelia deck her-

self with flowers, which she makes emblems of the past and of the 
feelings of the heart. Every one must be conscious, on first entering 
a garden or a room in which beautiful flowers strike the eye and their 
fragrance rises to the brain, of a change in inward feeling, a throwing 
off of thought-burdens and a taking on of pleasanter feelings and ideas. 
No ambition is more noble in an humble toiler for daily bread than 
that of having a little garden as well as a home of his own. The road 
of life would be far gloomier and harder than it is if there were no 
flowery meads along the way ; no perfumes to exalt and purify the 
thoughts from the dull routine and murky atmosphere of a world 
which seems divided between work and want — all but the oases in 
the desert, the flower-gardens and the incense-laden plants of beauty 
that spring up like visions of Eden regardened by a restored gardener. 
For man's first, happiest and healthiest employment was the " sweet 
gardening toil " which God gave him for his pastime in Paradise. 
Toil-worn, foot-sore and hand-stained as the wanderer from that first 
garden of peace and plenty may be, we shall never find a home, how- 
ever humble, in which a garden is well kept and cheers the roadside, 
or flowers adorn the windows and shed their fragrance through the 
rooms, inhabited by vice and violence. The flowers soon wither in 
a drunkard's home. The hand uplifted in anger cannot trim the 
flower-beds ; the fairest plant would wither at the touch of hatred, 
lying and envy ; there must be love and friendship, truth and sanctity 
in the home in which flowers grow. Else men and women would 
not use them as nature's emblems and adornments to wreathe the 
bridal feast and shed the hope of reunion in a brighter world upon 
the obsequies of the loved and lost. As home is happy, the weeds 
become extinct and the flowers bloom in greater beauty and abun- 
dance. When selfishness and sin have spoiled the Eden of home 
life, the roses die, the violets fade, "presently the fig tree withers 
away," only the bare boughs with " nothing but leaves " are left upon 
the roof-tree of happiness, duty and contentment. 

The following general directions for the information and guidance 
of such lovers of flowers as desire and have occasion to cultivate and 



266 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

tend them in the home will be found useful. These directions refer 
only to the simplest flowers and those easiest to cultivate. 

With proper care and attention, roses can be grown in a satisfac- 
tory manner in the conservatory or drawing-room. To that end, 
commence operations by throwing away all the old, scraggy plants 
you have had in pots for years, and commence anew. Then get 
some new plants. The best are those that have been growing in 
the open border for one or two years. Take any hybrid perpetual, 
tea, Bourbon or noisette, one that has had a good freezing and at rest. 
Take up carefully, so as not to injure the roots, and pot in a strong, 
rich soil. The best is well-rotted turf, three parts, and well-rotted 
manure, from the cow-stable, one part. Any new soil — that which 
underlies the sod of a meadow — is good. Avoid soil from the vege- 
table garden or from the woods. Choose a heavy clay in preference 
to a light, sandy soil. A heavy, sweet loam is the more desirable. In 
choosing pots, take those that will comfortably hold the roots, which 
should be shortened with sharp pruning shears or knife, say one-third 
the length. Be careful to have the roots evenly distributed through 
the pot, press the earth firmly around the roots, and thoroughly 
water. As soon as potted, or before, if more convenient, the plant 
must be well pruned or cut back. This point is one of the essentials 
in rose culture and must not be overlooked. It is a simple thing to 
show one how to prune the rose; but a difficult task to tell how to 
do it properly. New wood of nearly all roses usually starts from 
the root. In that case cut back to within four inches of the ground. 
If the new growth — that of the past year — has started from above 
the root, cut still closer — say to within two inches of the old wood. 
Do not in any case leave any old wood for the purpose of flowering. 
When the young wood starts from the root cut the old entirely away. 
Set the pots in a cool, dark room or cellar, where they should re- 
main four weeks, unless in the meantime they commence rapid 
growth, in which case they should be brought into full light and 
heat. After the watering the plant received when potted, no more is 
required until brought to the light. At this point much care is to be 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 267 

observed. Give no more than is actually necessary. During the 
first stages of growth absorption by the plant is slow. Increase the 
amount as the growth increases. As soon as the first leaves are fiilly 
developed, sprinkle every morning with tepid water. From this time 
onward give the plants all the light and sun possible. Do not let 
them get a chill, neither draughts of cold air, which will surely cause 
mildew, from which plants rarely recover. When the room needs 
ventilation, lower the windows only sufficient for the purpose. As 
long as artificial heat is used, do not raise the windows to admit 
warm air from outside, even though the temperature is higher than 
within; As a preventive of mildew, the plant should be lightly 
dusted once a week with the flour of sulphur. Should the green fly 
(aphis) put in an appearance, immediate steps toward its destruc- 
tion must be taken by fumigation, which, as a rule, is inconvenient 
in the living room, or dipping the plant in strong soap-suds and 
rinsing with clean water. Follow this plan daily as long as it is 
a necessity. 

There is no more destructive enemy of the rose tree than the slug 
or worm that eats the. varnish that nature has spread upon the upper 
side of the leaf, causing bushes to look often much as though the fire 
had singed them. These little worms should be met and conquered 
at once as soon as they make their appearance. A sure remedy is 
pulverized white hellebore. Put two ounces into six gallons of water, 
and with a brush-broom give the bushes a sprinkling, bending them 
so as to wet the leaves on both sides. It may possibly require two 
or three applications. 

A PRETTY and easily-grown window plant may be obtained in the fol- 
lowing manner: soak a round piece of coarse sponge in warm water 
until it has thoroughly expanded. After squeezing it about half dry, 
place in the openings millet, red clover, and barley-grass seeds, rice and 
oats. Hang the sponge in a window where the sun shines a part of 
the day, and sprinkle it lightly with water every morning for a week. 
Soon tender leaves will shoot out, and, growing rapidly, will form a 
drooping mass of living green. If regularly sprinkled it will later be 
dotted with the blossoms of the clover. 



268 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

To Preserve Rose Buds. — -Cover the freshly cut stems with wax. 
Place each one in a paper cone or cap so that the leaves do not touch 
the paper. The cap should be sealed up with glue to prevent air, 
dust, or moisture from entering. When the glue is dry it should be 
placed in a cool place. When wanted, cut off the waxed end and 
place in water, where it will bloom in a few hours. 

Watering Window Plants. — Tnere is nothing that seems to 
bother more those who would grow window flowers than how often to 
water them. It is an exceedingly simple thing to those who have had 
experience, though so mysterious a thing to those who have had 
none. When the skilled gardener is asked for advice he says, " Water 
only when the plants need it," but this tells the inquirer nothing. 
There still remains to be understood how to tell when plants need 
water. After all, this is a species of knowledge that cannot well be 
taught by another. It has to be learned from experience. The good 
plant cultivator tells from the color of the earth ; but even this is a 
relative term. There is dark soil and there is light soil ; but all soils 
are darker when they are wet than when dry. One can soon learn 
this by experimenting a little ; and can soon tell whether the earth is 
dry or wet by the eye or finger alone. If it is wet it of course wants 
no more water; if much lighter than its usual color, the earth is 
dry and needs some. It is an exceedingly simple matter to those 
who will try to learn; to those who cannot learn themselves it is a 
hopeless task. There is one hint that we may give that may be of 
value. If the earth never gets dry, the plants are not in good con- 
dition. Something is wrong. It is the active, growing, working 
roots that take the moisture out of the earth. It is a sign of good 
health for the plant to want frequent watering. 

Window Gardening. — Among the difficulties that beset window 
gardening in the winter are: i. Lack of room. Most window gar- 
deners use by far too large pots. Four or five inch pots will do for 
nearly all the plants usually grown. When the plants are lifted in 
the fall, cut back sharply. Remove nearly every leaf and all flower 
t>uds ; then reduce the ball of earth to three or four inches in diame- 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 269 

ter, and pot accordingly. Give the plant a cool, shady place till well 
started, then place in your window. Water occasionally with weak 
liquid manure. Geraniums and roses intended for the garden in the 
spring can thus be kept in large numbers, but without expectation 
of profuse bloom. 2. Lack of flowers. The only remedy is to keep 
just that number of plants that you can give full light and keep near 
the glass, with the temperature ranging from fifty to seventy or a little 
more. A few plants will bloom well somewhat back from the window, 
but heliotropes, geraniums, bouvardias, roses, require abundance of 
sunshine. 3. Abundance of bugs. These are natural scavengers 
provided to prevent you from being poisoned by sick plants. They 
indicate false conditions of growth. The affected plant is rotting at 
the roots from standing water or lack of drainage, or it is sick for 
want of sunshine. Bugs abound out-of-doors where there is damp 
shade or a tree disturbed in its adjustment of root and branch. 
Doctor your plants and lice will generally vanish. Red spiders ap- 
pear only where the atmosphere is too dry. Dust and dirt on the 
ieaves, closing the pores, also induce diseases and calls in the scav- 
engers. 4. Damping-off and mildew. This is due to a false system 
of watering, in connection with the low state of atmosphere. Great 
mistakes are made in watering. It seems nearly impossible to 
induce some plant lovers from trying to grow all their plants in a 
marsh. Few plants can endure standing in a soil constantly 
drenched, or in saucers of water. Less damage is done by drouth 
than by over-watering. A good rule is to thoroughly drench the 
soil once in two days, using water but little warmer than the tem- 
perature of the room. Geraniums especially revolt from superfluous 
water. Ageratums and heliotropes just as decidedly protest against 
(being in the least dried. The difficulties of damping-off and mildew 
are also fostered by the exceedingly rich soil sometimes used. It 
should be remembered that a plant or tree can be made dyspeptic. 

Geraniums, as a general thing, are wonderfully accommodating 
plants. They will grow almost anywhere and bear a great amount 
of ill-treatment and even neglect. These remarks are, however, more 



270 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

applicable to those of the so-called zonale varieties, which require 
plenty of sunlight and abundance of room to spread themselves. If 
grown in small pots, so that the roots will be cramped, they will bloom 
much quicker. One of the commonest errors of the amateur florists 
consists in the belief that the larger pot you give a plant just so 
much the better it will grow. Now here is the folly of the thing. 
If you give them a great deal of soil, of necessity the earth will be- 
come sour, because, in order to keep the soil moist, you will have to 
give more water than the plant can use. 

How TO Preserve Flowers in Sand. — While our art lovers 
warmly applaud all successful efforts to represent nature for the adorn- 
ment of our homes, the art of imprisoning real bits of nature for the 
same purpose is not sufficiently studied. The neglect of some of 
the pretty means of installing art in our homes is greatly observable 
in the preparation of flowers and leaves of all kinds for winter use. 
As usually pressed, they are flat and unnatural, and their fibres being 
packed closely and forced into straight lines, are extremely brit- 
tle. In the pretty ferns and autumn leaves, their delicate veinings 
are obliterated, and their characteristic dimples conventionalized 
away, while a pressed rose is no more like a rose than your best 
friend would be like herself if passed between the rollers of a paper 
mill. The best plan, but one which is not generally known, or used, 
is to press in sand, and this can be done as follows : Procure nice, 
clean, dry sand, white is preferable, and for white flowers indispensa- 
ble, if their pure tone would be retained. Pluck your flowers as 
freshly blown as possible, that they may contain plenty of sap; in 
most cases remove the stems, as they take up too much room, are 
not easily managed, and when dry do not carry the flowers as well as 
wire stems. Cover the bottom of the box with sand, then, resting 
the stem part of a flower thereon, and letting each petal fall in its 
natural position, fill its every interstice with sand, at the same time 
that you build up evenly and neatly about it. A common envelope 
box will contain enough flowers for two bouquets. Of course heavy- 
petalled flowers, such as dahlias, camelias, roses, etc., press better 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 2/1 

than, more delicate ones, although verbenas, and many small and 
delicate petalled flowei-s have come from their sand-beds looking so 
natural that only by very close inspection could they be told from 
natural flowers. The petals and leaves are quite tough, will bear 
handling almost as well as when fresh, and when placed in the bon- 
net, can with difficulty be distinguished from the finest artificial 
flowers, and when in the hair might readily be taken for a blossom 
fresh from the garden. Ferns and leaves are best laid flat in the box, 
especially the former, as their slender form will give them all the 
droop that is desirable. A bouquet or wreath, which it is usually im- 
possible to keep as a souvenir, can, with patience, be admirably pre- 
served in this manner. When once buried in the sand, no care is 
required, save that the boxes be kept in a moderately dry place, and 
await resurrection of their buried contents; flowers remain in sand 
from three to eight weeks, for the thinnest to the thickest leaved, 
and it is wise to give them a few days' grace; By the sea and in 
lake countries the sand is inclined to absorb moisture. They are not 
brittle, but to the touch are like tissue paper; when creased sharply, 
they break. 

To ascertain the best time for re-potting plants, knock the ball of 
earth out of the pot, and if the root is all grown together in a mass 
at the sides and bottom, the plant should be transferred to the next- 
sized pot. Never remove the soil from the roots with the hands, 
but rather wash it away, otherwise the fine fibrous roots on which 
the plant depends for subsistence may be damaged. 

There is no better cure for a sickly plant than to wash the roots 
clean, and then put in a new pot, using fresh soil. 

A FLOWER that can be heartily recommended to those cultivating 
out-door plants is Erysimum. They grow easily, and if planted in 
the summer will bloom late in the fall. Like Nemophila, Erysimum 
will almost take care of itself 

Of all house plants, a Catalonian Jessamine pays the best. From 
the 1st of August till New Year's day it bears a profusion of deli- 
cate white flowers, which exhale the most exquisite fragrance. If 



272 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

there were no flowers, the foliage, a delicate vine, would amply re- 
pay wintering. They never have a bug, the leaves never turn yellow 
and it requires very little care. 

A Water Bouquet. — A water bouquet is a novelty which ladies 
may be glad to hear about, especially when flowers are scarce- 
and ingenuity is taxed its uttermost for novelty and variety. The 
articles required are a circular glass dish and a low glass shade 
to fit inside the dish. The bouquet is made according to the size 
of the shade, as there must be a margin of an inch or so between 
the glass and the flowers. If the shade is small a very few 
flowers will suffice, and these should be put tightly together, with 
fern or moss arranged as much as possible to hide the stalks, which 
must be tied firmly together, and cut close. To look well for the 
centre of a dinner-table, the shade should not be smaller round than 
a pudding plate. A larger size would look even better; but the 
difficulty in making it is the quantity of water required, as you must 
place the dish in the bottom of a bath, with sufficient water to go 
over the top of the shade. Then weigh the bouquet with the glass 
stopper of a decanter or some like convenient article to make it 
stand upright and prevent the bouquet from floating. Perhaps a 
smaller stopper on each side would keep it more upright. Place 
the bouquet in the centre of the dish which is at the bottom of the 
bath, and ta :e the shade, holding it sidewise underneath the water, 
and place it carefully over the flowers, resting it on the dish. Care 
must be taken to keep the shade well under the water, as, when the 
bouquet is completed, the shade must be quite full of water, to the 
exclusion of all air. Lift the whole thing out of the water, slowly and 
with care ; dry the dish and place it on the table. It is unnecessary 
to say that it will be very heavy. The effect is beautiful, as the flowers 
appear magnified through the water, and a sparkling silvery effect is 
given to the leaves. This bouquet will last for two or three days as 
it is, and by changing the water, for much longer. In removing the 
shade it must be placed underneath the water, and care must be taken 
to do this gradually, or else the glass may crack and break. Even 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 2^3 

if the flowers have a withered look when seen without the water, 
they appear fresh again when the water is renewed. Very small 
water bouquets can be made with finger glasses, and pink ones have 
a pretty effect. These ornaments are exceedingly attractive on the 
breakfast and dinner-table. 

Growing Smilax in the House. — This beautiful winter climber 
— the graceful queen of decorative vines — is adapted alike to the 
green-house and conservatory. With very little care it can be grown 
successfully as a house plant. The seed should be sown in a box, 
or in pots, in the house; should be kept moist till the young plants 
appear. The seed being rather slow to germinate, you must not 
think it bad if it does not make its appearance for two weeks. The 
young plants should be potted off into three inch pots as soon as 
they are three or four inches high. Once a year the bulbs should be 
allowed to dry off and rest; they will start into growth again in 
about six weeks. The vine does not require the full sun, but it will 
grow in a partially-shaded situation. It can be trained on a small 
thread across the window or around pictures. It is a climbing vine, 
and will attach itself to a string in just about the right condition to 
use for wreaths, etc., or, when required for tighter work, the branches 
which become entangled can be separated. 

A Flower Bed. — One pretty and simple way to make a flower 
bed is to first prepare a rich soil, make a round bed, raise it a little 
in the centre, then in the centre drive a stake, and to it tie a string 
twenty inches long. At the other end of the string tie a pointed 
stick, and with it, walking around the bed, make a circle ; then untie the 
string and lengthen it thirty-five inches long, and in the same manner 
make another circle around the bed outside the first ; then again 
make the last or outside circle five inches from the centre ; now pull 
up the stake, and in its place put eight or ten zinnia seeds ; of course, 
don't throw them all in a heap. When they come up, pull up all 
but three or four thrifty plants ; it is better to have a few good plants 
thaii a dozen crowded ones. In the first circle or the one next to 
the centre, sow balsam ; in the second, asters ; in the third or out- 
i8 



274 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

side circle sow candytuft. When the seeds come up, thin the 
balsam and asters six or eight inches apart, and the candytuft two 
inches ; if any are missing, transplant. This plan is a much better 
one than to throw the seeds in the ground promiscuously, without 
regard to size or color. In this bed, of course, can be used different 
seeds than those named ; but be sure to have all the tallest plants in 
the centre, and blend the colors. This arrangement will be liked ; 
the balsams hide the long, naked zinnia stalks, while the white candy- 
tuft looks like a rift of snow around the bed. 

Another Way. — Select then for a rich and gorgeous show of 
bloom a few varieties of zonal geraniums, both single and double 
flowers, verbenas, heliotrope, etc. For a more artistic show, select 
lantanas, yellow jessamine, a half dozen fuchsias and varieties of 
flowering begonias. Of foliage plants, for ornament, the coleus, rex 
begonias, cannas, ricinus, and the caladium esculentum are not sur- 
passed in producing a tropical effect when properly massed in the 
door-yard or lawn. 

An attractive bed of these may be formed by first planting for a 
background a row of the ricinus, then a row of cannas, leaving two and 
one-half feet space in centre of row for the caladium esculentum, the 
next row may be of dark or velvet coleus, another of light colored 
or golden coleus, finishing off with a row of cineraria maratima. 
This forms a very attractive bed on the lawn, even when viewed from 
a distance. 

In front of this, but not too close, will be wanted a bed of the queen 
of flowers, the rose. They should be of the ever-blooming class, as 
they, with good soil and culture, make a grand show of sweet-scented 
buds, from early summer until late autumn. If you are not ac- 
quainted with the varieties you had better send your order to the 
florist and let him select for you, as he will in nine cases out of ten 
send you a better selection, variety, and color than you could your- 
self 

As a late-blooming plant none excels the china aster. Sow the 
seed in a box about the middle of April, or in the open ground two

weeks later. When the plants are about three or four inches high 
transplant to a bed in the lawn or garden, made very rich, and in 
the full sunshine. 

Seasonable Hints. — Plants growing with full vigor with the pots 
full of roots will require an abundance of water — every day will not 
be too much if the weather is clear. Take the same plant with but 
a few leaves on it, just shifted into fresh soil, with but a few roots, 
and watering once a week may even be too much for it. The tem- 
perature of the water supplied to plants should be about the same 
degree as the temperature of the room in which they are growing, 
and when water is applied sufficient should be given to thoroughly 
saturate the soil. A mere dribbling on the surface does more harm 
than good, as it draws up what moisture there may be in the soil 
when it is wet. Let the water run through into the saucer and then 
empty it out, but on no account allow the plants to remain in it. 

Repot plants into the next size in which they have been growing, but 
remember that most plants bloom more quickly by having their roots 
cramped in small pots." If you have any sickly plants, wash all the 
dirt off the roots and give new soil and clean pots. 

The best time for cutting flowers is immediately after sundown — 
unless to preserve them from a storm, which would otherwise destroy 
or prevent their being cut in the evening. On cloudy days the time 
of cutting is a matter of much less difference. The explanation of 
these rules as to the proper time for cutting is found in the state of 
the sap at different times of the day and night. From the earliest 
dawn until sundown the leaves are actively drawing upon the roots, 
and the sap is flowing freely. After that time the leaves are nearly 
dormant till morning. The plant is then resting — is asleep. A 
flower cut in the sunshine will wilt at once, and if not put into water 
will quickly perish ; whereas, if cut at sunset it will remain fresh all 
night. In a cool place it will not appear to change for a long time, 
even if not put in water, yet in a close, hot room it will fade in an 
hour. In this connection, it must be remembered that no rose 
should be allowed to expand fully before cutting. Cut them all 



2/6 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

while in bud. This rule may be applied to every flower. It cost 
the plant more to bring one flower to full maturity than to produce 
a dozen buds. Therefore cut as soon as in condition, and cut them 
all. To suffer flowers to fade on a plant, and go to seed, is to lose 
nine-tenths of the whole crop. Freedom and generosity in cutting 
flowers is the best and the truest economy. 

Plants at rest are usually stored away under the benches, in the 
greenhouse, or by amateurs under a flower-stand or in the cellar. It 
is unnecessary to remove them from their pots. A period of six or 
eight weeks' rest is generally allowed to fuchsias, crape myrtles, 
lemon verbenas, and such shrubby plants. 

To Preserve Flowers. — An excellent method for preserving 
flowers consists simply in immersing them for a moment in melted 
paraffine, drawing them out quickly, and shaking them gently so as 
to remove the excess. The flowers should be fresh-plucked and en- 
tirely free from drops of water. The paraffine must be heated only 
enough to be liquid, as a greater degree of temperature would injure 
the flowers. The flowers should be immersed one by one, and 
shaken about somewhat so as to prevent the adhesion of bubbles of 
air to the surface. This method was discovered by a celebrated 
German perfumer, and is quoted as being a perfect one. 

Flower Raising. — The soil for potting plants should- be composed 
of two parts of fine fibrous earth from the woods and some good 
garden soil. For cactus use one-half sand or old lime. Second, for 
drainage, place small pieces of charcoal or broken earthware over the 
hole in the bottom of the pot. Place your plant in the centre of the 
pot, press the earth around it closely, water thoroughly and enough 
to wet the roots and moisten all the soil. Do not use any more 
water until the earth looks dry. Some will require water sooner 
than others. Rap the side of the pot, and if the sound is dull they 
are wet enough, but if clear and sharp they need more water. Use 
soft water always; it should be lukewarm. Evening is the best 
time for watering them. Cuttings of oleander and some other plants 
root best in a bottle of water in the sunshine. Slips that are pulled 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 2/7 

off of plants so as to bring a piece of the old wood will be more apt 
to live. Keep in the light as much as possible. Plants will not live 
in the dark. It is a good plan to wash plants every fev/ weeks with 
lukewarm soap-suds and rinse with clean water. 

The plants suitable for winter blooming are numerous, but none 
afford so much pleasure as a good collection of bulbs, such as hya- 
cinth, narcissus, and the early tulips and other bulbs. Plants for 
winter use should be started from slips or seed in May or Jurte. 
They should be set in a rich loam and kept damp; In a cool but 
light situation a large growth is not good, but a strong, close one. 
Allow no flowers or buds until removed into the house in Septem- 
ber. When old plants are taken for winter use they should be well 
cut in, so that new wood may be produced. Remember, it takes 
about six months to produce a plant for house use that is suitable for 
blossoms. 

English Ivy is a charming decoration for rooms in the winter sea- 
son, but it is difficult to keep the leaves fresh-looking with furnace 
heat and gas. A lady, whose ivies, in spite of these drawbacks, 
always retain the appearance of vigor and beauty, put a small piece 
of beefsteak at the root of the plants every spring and fall. The 
same result it is said can be produced by lightly rubbing each 
leaf on both sides with sweet oil. 

To keep cut flowers fresh the first rule is not to put too many into 
the glass at once; change the water once or even twice a day, re- 
move decayed leaves directly they appear, and cut the ends of the 
stems occasionally. A still better way is to put nitrate of soda in 
the water — about as much as can be easily taken up by the fingers ; 
put into the glass each time the water is changed. It will preserve 
cut flowers in all their beauty for above a fortnight. Common salt- 
petre in water will almost answer the same purpose, but it is not 
quite so efficacious. 

Tuberoses are tender. To do well and blossom early they should 
be started in the house. Here is one way : Plant them in old tomato 
cins, without punching any holes for drainage, set them on the man- 



2/8 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

tel over the kitchen stove, and keep warm and wet. When well 
started move to a cooler place, and in June set out in the garden. 
The old double variety runs up a stem six or seven feet high, and 
produces very fragrant flowers. Now there is a dwarf sort called 
pearl; the bulbs of this are much smaller but the flowers are equally 
as good. 

Fancy Fern-Pans.— With but little pains the fancy fern-pans, or 
" Boston ferneries " as they are called by florists, can be filled. These 
will grow and remain fresh for months if well watered. If the 
woods are visited on an open winter's day a variety of pretty mosses 
and ferns may be gathered. A basket should be taken in which to 
place rock moss, wood moss, and swamp moss, which will be found 
in rock crevices, at the roots of trees and in the swamps. This is 
used as the foundation for the fernery. At any tin shop a pan half 
an inch deeper than a round tin pie-pan can be made. In this mix 
the several kinds of mosses. The prettiest collection to gather is 
graceful branches of pines, pitcher plants, snake roots, wintergreen, 
fungus, wood berries, lycopodium, wild cranberries, acorns, pterris, 
linum, and ferns of any kind. Arrange them tastefully in the moss, 
plunging the roots and stems well into it. The fernery should be 
soaked with water morning and night. The water should be well 
drained off by tipping the pan. If these ferneries are placed on the 
round gilded baskets so popular this season, they make a charming 
and economical centre-piece for the dinner-table. 

Fuchsias are propagated by cuttings taken from the young wood 
in early spring, rooted in damp sand. As soon as roots are formed 
they are potted in very rich earth, for they are voracious feeders. In 
a very few weeks the pots will be full of roots, when the plants should 
be shifted into the next size, and this treatment should be followed as 
often as the pots are filled. Quite a large plant can be grown in a 
season from a cutting. Fuchsias are very fond of iron in their food, 
and some florists give them copperas dissolved in water. Others 
use nails put in the earth, and the plants grow more rapidly than 
when not so treated. 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 279 

A fuchsia, if left to its own accord, will generally make a strag- 
Fgling growth. They can be trained into perfect shape in this way: 
As soon as the cutting has grown about eight inches in height, the top 
is cut out, which induces the plant to throw out side branches. These 
again are kept shortened in such a manner that the plant becomes 
bushy at the base and runs to a point at the top. If this course is 
regularly pursued a most symmetrical plant will be the result. 

Rotted Sods are made by cutting turf-grass with the. soil attached 
to the roots — in the spring time. These sods, or turfs as sometimes 
called, are then piled up one on top of another in piles and left to 
decompose. If soap-suds be carried from the wash-tub and thrown 
on the pile the potash in the suds will go to make the compost still 
richer. Many florists have soil on hand so prepared that it is kept 
many years. 

How TO Set Grafts. — The season for grafting may be said to be 
from the first of April to June, the time when the forces of nature 
are impelling the upward flow of sap in the tree. " Grafts have been 
set the last day of May with as much success as at any other time. 
When understood — and it ought to be an easy thing to learn — any 
one can do his own grafting. Yet due care must be taken in all 
the details to insure growing. 

" Stocks or limbs to be grafted, not over two inches in diameter, 
should be cut off at the distance of four inches. A fine saw should 
be used. Incline the saw so that the stump will shed the rain. The 
bark must be uninjured. With a sharp knife smooth off the sawed 
stump. Take a case-knife, which is as good as any, place it 
across the heart of the stock, and force it down with a wooden mal- 
let. Use a very narrow screw-driver for keeping open the split. 
Shape the scion wedge-fashion both ways, keeping the bark intact. 
Make a shoulder as far up as the scion is shaved; it is not so 
strong, but better insures growth. The inside of the bark of both 
scion and stock must meet or cross, in order that the sap of the two 
may commingle. Set the scion at a slight angle spreading from each 
other. When the stock is small and only one scion inserted, place a 



280 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

piece of wood on the opposite side of corresponding thickness. If 
the slit does not close up sufficiently, tie round a cotton string to^ 
keep it tight upon the graft. Cover with wax every part of the cut 
wood and slit. In three weeks' time go over the grafts and rewax if 
needed. It is air and rain getting in that destroy. Where the limb 
to be grafted is from two to four inches over, it should be cut say six 
inches from the tree, and from four to six scions may be inserted. 

The cause of buds blasting may be attributed to several reasons. 
One is allowing the plant to get too dry, both at the roots and the fo- 
liage, from want of sprinkling. A still more common cause is the 
escape of coal gas from the stove. This gas from coal-stoves also 
causes the leaves to drop, and often leads to still greater damage. 

The entire contents of a large greenhouse have been destroyed 
because of the fact that the flue used in heating the building in some 
way cracked in the night-time, and, as coal was burned in the furnace, 
the deadly coal gas killed everything. 

In order to rid house plants of small, white worms, gardeners take 
a fine flour sieve and sift the dirt well before putting in the pots for 
the plants. 

Cut off the flowers of roses as they fade ; the second crop will be 
much better for the attention. Seeds of all flowering plants should 
be also taken off"; all this assists the duration of the blooming sea- 
son. After the walks and lawns, the flower-beds should be a constant 
source of attention. If the plants appear to suffer by drought, 
there is no better remedy than to place a fork around the plant and 
loosen up the soil deeply without disturbing the plant more than can 
be avoided. After being thus loosened, it will not dry out near as 
much as before. Above all, keep the surface continually broken by 
hoeing and breaking fine. Nothing is so sure a preventive of soil- 
drying as a loose, porous texture. But much of watering and hoeing 
will be saved, if in hot places the flowers have tan or other mulching 
substances over the beds among the flowers. 

To Grow Hyacinths in Water. — To grow hyacinths in glasses 
is the most simple thing imaginable, and yet let it be remembered 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 281 

that the roots of all plants will, by their natural instinct, hide them- 
selves from the light, so whenever you purchase hyacinth glasses, 
which are very cheap nowadays, select dark colors, blue or red for 
instance, and those of the long narrow or Belgian pattern in prefer- 
ence to the more elaborate styles. The hyacinth makes long white 
roots, and to make them quickly and before it starts into leaf growth, 
the bulbs, after being either potted or put in the glasses, must be put 
entirely in the dark for about six weeks. Always use rain water. 
Fill the glasses so that the water will barely touch the bottom of the 
bulb. The water should be changed as often as once in three weeks, 
using pure rain water of the same temperature as you took them 
out of A piece of charcoal in the water will cause it too keep sweet 
longer. A little ammonia dissolved in the water will give the 
flowers much brighter color. 

To grow the hyacinth in moss, you need only place in the bottom 
of your intended bulb garden a layer of nice clean moss laid in quite 
loosely. On this plant your hyacinth or other bulbs — and by the 
way the Polyanthus narcissus is a good one for this purpose. Cover 
them with moss, and take care to keep it always damp. Holes may 
be cut in large sponges, such as coachmen use, and a small hyacinth 
bulb stuffed into them. The sponge may be suspended by a string, 
and will naturally excite curiosity as the bulbs develop themselves. 
Of course the sponge must be kept wet. Remember, the hyacinth 
will grow anywhere and in anything where it can have abundant 
moisture. 

Propagating Plants. — One of the first necessary conditions is 
that the plant from which the cutting or slip is taken must be in 
vigorous health. If, for example, you wish to root cuttings of green-, 
house or bedding plants, one of the best guides to the proper con- 
dition is when the cutting breaks or snaps clean off, instead of bend- 
ing or kneeing. If it snaps off so as to break, it will root freely; if it 
bends it is too old, and though it may root it will root much slower 
and make a weaker plant. A general idea is current that a cutting 
must be cut at or below a joint or eye. The practice of this system 



282 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

leads to many cases of failure, from the fact that when a slip is cut 
from the joint the shoot often has become too hard at that point, 
while half an inch higher up, or above the point, the proper condi- 
tion will be found. 

The best condition to root cuttings of the great majority of green- 
house plants is sixty-five degrees of bottom heat and an atmospheric 
temperature of fifteen degrees less. Sand is the best medium in which 
to place cuttings ; color or texture is of no especial importance. 
From the time the cuttings are inserted until they are rooted they 
should never be allowed to get dry; it is best to keep the sand 
soaked with water. Kept thus saturated there is less chance of the 
cutting getting wilted, for if a cutting is once wilted, its juices are ex- 
pended. Permitting a moderate circulation of air in the propagating 
house prevents the germination of that spider-like web substance 
which is known as " fungus of the cutting bench." It is best to pot 
off the cuttings at once when rooted. They should be placed in 
small pots from two to two and a half inches wide. In larger pots 
the soil dries out too slowly and the tender root rots. 

Begonias are indispensable plants for the window gardener, as 
their leaves are often more beautiful than their flowers, and so very 
numerous are their varieties and so continuous their flowering, that 
one could furnish a window with no other plants, and be sure of 
having them in flower the year round, while they will endure any 
amount of heat and a good supply of water if the soil is sandy and it 
is not kept in a sodden condition. Yet they will fully repay careful 
treatment by a more luxuriant growth of leaves and flowers. There 
is no variety of begonia that does not make a desirable window 
plant, but B. alba nitida and B. rosea nitida are the most constant 
bloomers that are now cultivated. B. incarnata and B. fuchsioides 
are also lovely plants, with drooping panicles of blush and crimson 
flowers. Good drainage is essential, and a few bits of charcoal at the 
bottom of the pot will keep the soil in good condition. A compost 
of half garden soil and half leaf mold, or peaty soil with a table- 
spoonful of sand well stirred in, will grow very fine plants. There are 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 283 

three germs or species of begonias: those above mentioned, rex 
begonias, or elephant-leaf begonia and the tuberous rooted varieties, 
which make very beautiful plants, either for the window garden, vase, 
or basket culture, and the open border. The tubers can be taken up 
in the autumn and kept like dahhas when they are used for bedders 
in summer. 

Camellia Japonica. — Grafting should be done in August and 
September, and inarching in July. The cuttings may be started 
under glass. Care must always be observed in watering, as too 
much or too little water will cause the buds to drop, and the tem- 
perature must remain even, and there be no sudden change of any 
kind, or the result would be the same. Water thoroughly, and turn 
all water from the saucer, as they are very sensitive, and sour soil is 
always sure death. The leaves must be sponged frequently. In its 
native woods the camellia grows in moist, shady localities ; therefore 
do not put it in the sun, and, if the buds are thick, pick off the small, 
weak ones, that the blossoms may not crowd each other. Never 
touch the buds, as they blast so easily, and do not sprinkle when in 
bud, but apply the water to the soil and sponge the leaves if necessary. 
If your leaves are spotted, it was caused by sprinkling when the sun 
was on them ; care must be here exercised also. They need but little 
heat or sun, and why they are not more generally cultivated in 
window gardens is not understood'. They are usually expensive, 
but not more so than many other plants. They will die if you give 
too rich a soil. There are several of the evergreen shrubby varieties 
which do well in the dry air of our living rooms. One of the best 
is what is known as Piitisporiim tobira Chinensis; it has a beautiful 
glossy, dark color, rich foliage. 

Preserving Autumn Leaves. — Autumn leaves are used in various 
methods, the most popular being, perhaps, to dry them flatly and care- 
fully, and take great care to preserve their stalks. When thoroughly dry, 
they are varnished with "Canada balsam varnish," which gives them 
a pretty gloss, and also acts as a preservative to them from all insects 
and moths. After this they are carefully laid aside for the decora- 



284 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

tion of the winter dinner-table, and may be most safely preserved in 
a tin box, with a well-fitting cover. Grasses added to them are very 
effective, and when dry they may be dyed at home with Judson's 
dyes. They may be also frosted when dry, by dipping each stalk 
into a solution of alum, and leaving them to dry upright. With the 
glasses and leaves may be used the dried everlasting flowers and the 
prepared moss ; however, no little taste is needed in their arrange- 
ment to avoid the least heaviness of effect. Grass vases and stands 
are the most effective for their arrangement, as the transparency of 
these increases the wished-for lightness and grace. Another way of 
using the dried leaves is for the ornamentation of tables, blotting- 
books, or boxes. Old cigar boxes, when painted black, are very 
favorite articles for decoration ; but now we know the value of var- 
nished unpainted wood. Many people will prefer the effect of the 
cigar boxes unpainted, with the unvarnished leaves gummed on, and 
the box and leaves varnished afterward. If, however, a black ground 
be especially desired, use " Brunswick black," to stain the wood, or 
" Brunswick black " and turpentine mixed, to make a rich-looking 
brown grounding. Then gum on the leaves in a central group, be- 
ing careful to cut away, with a sharp pair of scissors, all the under 
parts of the leaves which will be hidden by others above, as too 
many thicknesses of leaf will make an uneven surface, and give an 
ugly appearance to the work when finished. 

Rockeries and Grottos. — These rustic ornaments are made of 
common rocks, stones and shells, piled up in pyramidal forms several 
feet high and many feet across the base. The rocks can be cemented 
together or fastened by piling them up irregularly, so that they will 
form nooks and pockets all the way up to the top, to hold the soil 
for growing plants and vines. At the bottom niches and grottos can 
be filled with ferns and vines that grow best in water, while at the top 
can be placed those plants that most enjoy heat and sunshine. 

Do not locate the rock-work too near the house, for distance here 
adds beauty to the view. Nature always hides her mossy and ferny

natural as possible, never allowing any pieces of the painted pottery 
or any of the other imitations of statuary or rock-work to be placed 
in or near it. Gather material for it yourself from the woods and 
rocky shores ; old gnarled knotty roots of trees are an addition ; all 
sorts of wild wood plants that grow in damp, dark places can be 
made to grow here if they can be kept damp enough. When one has 
any means of bringing water in pipes to the ground, it is an easy 
matter to manage this, and in most cases a fish pond can be arranged 
in the grotto. Where one cannot have water brought to the grounds, 
then it will be a better and more successful plan to plant only the 
vines and flowers that do not need much water. 

Creeping Charlie, Kenilworth ivy and many other vines will grow 
in dry places, and several species of cactus will grow in the dry, 
sandy soil. When plants are brought from the woods they should 
be transplanted in their native soil. Mosses, lichens, dwarf ever- 
greens, strawberry vines. Jack in the pulpit, joy Virginia creeper, 
caladiums, coleuses, and all other species of ferns, will grow here. 
Those that grow best in damp and shade should be placed at 
the base, and such flowers as mignonette, pansy and wild colum- 
bine will grow up nearer the top, and so will nearly all geraniums. 
The brilliant yellow and scarlet nasturtiums, also chrysanthe- 
mums, are very beautiful. The latter are a brilliant purple, white or 
yellow. 

The moneywort is a hardy little plant ; the ice plant is particularly 
pretty with its leaves sparkling with dew drops, but is not very hardy, 
nor is the maurandia. The pretty little sedum and wandering Jew 
are also effective. Anything will grow in a rockery that will grow 
in the shade or shallow soil. Some of the plants and vines men- 
tioned will not grow in the rockery if entirely shaded, and if it could 
be placed so that the sun would shine on it an hour or two each day, 
and the sun-loving plants placed on the sunny side, it would be an 
improvement. Many of these, particularly where there is a fish pond, 
are placed out in the open grounds, and when the sun shines brightly 
the fishes dart in the shadow of the rocks. 



286 TllE^HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

The Preservation of Bouquets. — (i) Bouquets that are made in 
the morning for evening wear should be put away in tin boxes rather 
than placed in water, or kept in the dark with water ; they will be 
much fresher by so doing. (2) A little gum is sometimes dropped 
into the centre of flowers, or round the outside of their petals, to help 
in their preservation. This treatment is particularly necessary for 
flowers whose petals are but loosely attached to their stems, or where 
the whole flower drops at the slightest touch, as the patience of the 
decorator is much tried when, on the completion of the bouquet, half 
the work falls away. The gum to be used for flowers should be pure 
and colorless, and is best made at home. Buy at the druggist's some 
best white gum arable, pick away from it any discolored lumps, and 
dissolve in boiling water. When quite liquid, strain through an old 
muslin handkerchief, and place it in a bottle ready for use. Drop 
into the centre of such flowers as azaleas, pelargoniums, jessamines, 
and stephanotis a little gum from the point of a clean paint-brush, 
and allow it to dry before using the flower. Round the outside of 
the azalea, besides the inside application, pass a brushful of gum, and 
do the same to the stephanotis just where the petals of the fragile 
flower join together. The gum must be very strong, so that a little 
used is sufficient, and it should not be apparent unless the flower is 
closely examined. (3) Bouquets can be sent a great distance and 
kept fresh, provided they are properly packed. The flowers should 
always be immersed in clear, cool water before wiring and making 
up, and when placed, wet moss should be rolled round their founda- 
tions, and cardboard or tin boxes about their sizes provided for them 
to be packed in. They fare best in tin boxes, as the outer air is 
then entirely excluded, and the flowers are not hurt by the pressure 
of other parcels. 

To Transplant Mignonette. — Those who have tried to transplant 
mignonette have found to their satisfaction that it is no easy thing to 
do, especially when the plants have grown two or three inches high. 
The best plan is to fill small flower-pots, such as florists call thumbs 
(they are two and a half inches across the top), with good soil, press 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. ' 28/ 

it firmly, so that it will not crumble when turned out, make it even 
on top, then put the pots in the ground up to the rim ; if properly- 
done they will look like honey-comb. Sow the seed broadcast over 
the pots, cover the same way with fine soil — not more than one-eighth 
of an inch deep — then water lightly ; shade when the sun is out with 
muslin or paper until the plants begin to come up. When they are 
one or two inches high, plant them in the open ground. If there are 
too many plants in the pot, thin them out ; water them every evening 
if the weather is dry ; by so doing you can have the rows full and 
the plants one or two weeks earlier. 

Planting Flower Seeds. — A good way to plant seeds which you 
wish to take particularly good care of is to take a turnip, cut it in halves, 
scrape out the shell, then fill with earth and plant the seeds. When 
the time comes to put the plant out-doors, dig a hole in the flower- 
bed large enough to set the turnip in. It will root in a short time, 
and your plants will thrive by not having the tender roots disturbed. 

In every garden, no matter how much may be done in the way of 
ornament, there should be somewhere a bed from which the flower- 
lovers of the household can feel free to cut as they please. Flowers 
in masses, and ribbon lines, or as specimen plants, are well, but it is 
much better to have a place where those who really love flowers can 
go and cut a handful with no gardener to prevent. Such a bed 
should have, of all things, an abundance of the best kind of mign- 
onette, and if confined to annuals, the candy tufts, white and crimson, 
sweet alyssum, sweet peas, stocks, China asters, the annual pinks, and 
a host of others. Never mind about the arrangement, so that there 
will be flowers, and a plenty of them ; then all the household can '• cut 
and come again," without feeling that they trespass. 

Training Tomato Plants. — Many more and better ripened toma- 
toes can be obtained when the plants are carefully trained, and the 
labor required in this operation is slight. It is only necessary to 
drive some stakes into the ground about each plant, and tie the 
branches to it ; this may be done with or without encircling hoops. 
One way of training that has approved itself is to drive a strong stake 



288 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

by each plant, so that it shall stand four or five feet high. Having 
stopped the plant when young, and made two eyes to start near the 
top, raise up two stems, and as they grow, wind or train them around 
the stake until the top is reached, and there stop them, causing 
numerous branches to form. This is a very simple and excellent 
method of training. 

How the Japanese Restore Faded Flowers. — After a bouquet 
is drooping beyond all remedies of fresh water, the Japanese can 
bring it back to all its first glory by a very simple and seemingly 
most destructive operation. A visitor to Japan says : " I had received 
some days ago a delightful bundle of flowers from a Japanese ac- 
quaintance. They continued to live in all their beauty for nearly 
two weeks, when at last they faded. Just as I was about to have 
them thrown away the same gentleman (Japanese gentleman) came 
to see me. I showed him the faded flowers, and told him that, 
though lasting a long time, they had now become useless. 'Oh, no,' 
said he, ' only put the ends of the stems into the fire, and they will 
be as good as before.' I was incredulous ; so he took them himself 
and held the stems' ends in the fire until they were charred. This 
was in the morning ; at evening they were again looking fresh and 
vigorous, and have continued so for another week. What may be 
the true agent in this reviving process I am unable to determine fully; 
whether it be the heat driving once more the last juices into every 
leaflet and vein, or whether it be the bountiful supply of carbon fur- 
nished by the charring. I am inclined, however, to the latter cause, 
as the full effect was not produced until some eight hours afterwards, 
and as. it seems that if the heat was the principal agent, it must have 
been sooner followed by visible changes." 

Hyacinths, Tulips, etc. — Hyacinths, tulips. Narcissus, and other 
so-called Dutch bulbs, that have been planted in boxes or potted in 
September or October, should by November i.st be well rooted; see 
that they are well rooted before you put them in the light, and when 
they once start to grow, if in pots, see that they get plenty of water, 
as nothing will cause them to fail so easily as want of water just 



FLORICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. 289 

when they are in their growing state, ready to bloom ; you may oilce 
in two weeks water them with a liquid manure, or some of Bowker's 
ammoniated food for plants, dissolved in water; this is very invigorat- 
ing for them just at this time. Give them plenty of sun when they 
start to throw up the flowering stalk, and on warm days let them 
have fresh air.

THE LAUNDRY. 

" Cleanliness is next to godliness.-' 

EXT after good food one wants good washing, and a 
home that is poorly provided in this respect is lacking 
in a most essential feature. Sweet, clean clothes are a 
comfort, and the week's washing, folded in snowy heaps 
after a careful airing, is a restful sight to a housekeeper. 
To wash well is a gift, since there are many who try with all their 
strength to do it and fail. The qualification requisite is a taste for 
it, and appliances at hand with which to wash easily. Not all city 
homes are provided with stationary tubs, wringers and other con- 
veniences, but where they are furnished the work is accomplished with 
greater speed and efficiency and the laundress is not tired out from 
the day's occupation. The work is the hardest, at best, that falls to 
women, and it should be made as easy as possible. It is the work 
that is always allotted to them, and where men are compelled to 
take any part in it, in large institutions for instance, all mechanical 
appliances that can be furnished are supplied to lighten the labor. 
Women take it as it comes, and do it under the most discouraging 
of conditions. If they know how to wash, knowledge makes it 
easier, but to a young beginner it is laborious, discouraging and 
depressing. 

There are directions without end as to how to wash, and no two 
are agreed. In every home there are special ways of doing work, 
and each laundress has a plan of her own. To those who have no 
knowledge on the subject a few hints are offered below. Experience 
allied to neatness makes the best laundresses we have, and unless a 
(ago) 



THE LAUNDRY. 29 1 

woman is very tidy she will never make a good washer and cannot 
learn to like it. To iron well requires care and practice, but it is 
easier to learn to iron than to wash. The clothes once clean and 
ready to be ironed, the ironing seems a much less laborious under- 
taking, and it certainly can be done with less disarrangement of the 
room or the worker's attire. 

The best housekeepers contend that clothes should not be soaked 
over night, because it gives them a gray look, and the soiled parts 
lying against the clean portions streak them. Before beginning to 
wash, the clothes should be assorted, and the fine ones kept separate all 
through the washing. Rub the clothes in warm — not hot — water. Hot 
water sets, instead of extracting, the dirt. Turn them and rub them till 
perfectly clean in the first water. If the water be.comes much soiled, 
throw it out and take fresh, for if the water is allowed to become very 
much soiled, the clothes will be dingy. The clothes should then be 
rubbed out as thoroughly in the second as in the first water. No 
amount of rinsing or boiling will ever make clothes white which have 
not been thoroughly rubbed out. 

After the second rubbing, put the clothes in cold water to boil, 
without rubbing soap on them or putting soap in the water; they are 
soapy enough. Too much soap makes clothes yellow and stiff As 
soon as they begin to boil, remove them to' the " sudsing "-water. 
If they boil long, they will be yellow. Let each article be well 
" soused " up and down in- the sudsing-water, rubbing them out 
thoroughly with the hands to get the suds out ; wring dry and throw 
in the " rinsing-water,'' which is the last water. Let this be slightly 
blued. Excessive bluing is the careless washerwoman's refuge. The 
rinsing is to be as thorough as the sudsing. 

After rinsing, starch. The old-fashioned idea, that clothes require 
to be dried before being starched, is not sustained by intelligent ob- 
servation. Dip the articles in boiling hot starch, plunging the hands 
constantly into cold water to prevent their being scalded, and rubbing 
the starch well in. 

Next hang out, and be sure to stretch every inch possible to the 



292 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

sun and the wind. Garments hung double, or in bunches or festoons, 
will not bleach. 

Wash flannels in lukewarm water, and rinse in water of the same 
temperature. Avoid rubbing soap upon the flannels. Stretch them; 
when thoroughly clean, snap them energetically, and hang them up 
immediately — by the fire if the weather is bad. Two waters are 
enough for flannels. 

Bleaching Flannels. — A solution of one and one-quarter of a 
pound of white soap and three-eighths of an ounce of spirits of 
ammonia, dissolved in twelve gallons of soft water, will impart a 
beautiful and lasting whiteness to any flannels dipped in it, no matter 
how yellow they have been previous to their immersion. After being 
well stirred round for a short time, the articles should be taken out 
and well washed in clean, cold water. 

When sprinkling clothes, dip collars, cuffs and shirt-bosoms in 
cold starch, made so thin as to look like water with a little milk in 
it. Clothes starched thus need no wax, lard, nor other preparation 
to make them iron easily. A smooth, dead white is generally more 
highly esteemed now than the glazed look which shirt manufacturers 
give to their linen. 

All-wool dress goods or colored flannels should be washed out 
quickly in tepid water, rinsed in water of the same temperature, wrung 
dry, and then folded up for a time, together with one or two sheets, 
so that the moisture shall be extracted by the cotton or linen ; they 
should then be ironed till dry. A patent wringer (made of India- 
rubber rollers, which can be adjusted) is almost indispensable in 
washing. It does not wear the clothes like the twisting and wrench- 
ing of hand-wringing, and saves the most exhausting part of the 
wash, besides having the clothes drier than can be the case with 
ordinary hand-wringing. 

Salt or beefs-gall in the water helps to set black. A tablespoonful 
of spirits of turpentine to a gallon of water sets most blues, and alum 
is very efficacious in setting green. Black or very dark calicoes 
should be stiffened with gum-arabic — five cents' worth is enough for 



THE LAUNDRY. 293 

a dress. If, however, starch is used, the garment should be turned 
wrong side out. 

To Wash Light-colored Cashmere, and Method for Remov- 
ing Spots. — All spots should be removed from the goods before they 
are put into the water, and the method must depend upon what they 
are and also the color of the goods. Benzine, which should always 
be used with caution because of its inflammable character, is one of 
the best and quickest means of taking out grease. A little rubbed 
lightly in the direction the warp runs will usually remove it entirely. 
Get the highly rectified benzine, such as first-class druggists keep. 
Chloroform rubbed on lightly and quickly will also remove grease. 
Unless done rapidly and finished by rubbing with a dry cloth it is 
apt to leave a slight stain. Fruit stains can usually be removed by 
a little salts of lemon. Frequently a lighted sulphur match held 
under the stain will drive it away. Acid stains, unless they be nitric, 
will yield to an application of ammonia, while those produced by 
alkalies, such as soda, ammonia, etc., will usually disappear by the 
application of acetic acid, diluted in a good deal of water. Of course, 
the use of these things depends much upon color and material. 

After the spots are removed, put the goods in warm (not hot) soft 
water and wash carefully. Lay it while still very damp upon the 
ironing-board, with a linen cloth over it, and iron with a hot flat-iron 
until dry. Press a fold down the centre of each breadth, and the 
cashmere will look almost if not quite as well as new. 

Potato water is excellent to wash black calicoes in, as it starches 
the calico without impairing its cleanness. Ordinary starch cannot 
be used. The potato water should be boiled to a thick consistency. 

Black bombazine may be nicely washed by making good suds, 
and adding to it a small quantity of ox-gall. It should be squeezed 
and rinsed, but not rubbed or wrung out. 

To Wash Blankets. — Wash them in good suds until quite clean ; 
if much soiled, they will require two or three waters ; rinse them in 
tepid water until clear, adding to the last rinsing-water a very little 
fine soap. 



294 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

To Clean Black Cashmere. — Wash in hot suds with a little borax 
in the water; rinse in bluing water — very blue — and iron while damp. 
It will look almost equal to new. 

Washing Light-colored Calicoes. — Take a tablespoonful of alum 
and dissolve it in enough lukewarm water to rinse a print dress. 
Dip the soiled dress into it, taking care to wet thoroughly every part 
of it, and then wring it out. Have warm (not hot) suds all ready and 
wash out the dress quickly ; then rinse it in cold water. (White Castile 
soap is the best for colored calicoes if it can be commanded.) Have 
the starch ready — but not too hot ; rinse the dress in it, wring it out 
and hang it out to dry, but not in the sun. Place it where the wind 
will strike it rather than the sun. When dry, iron directly. Prints 
should never be sprinkled, but if allowed to become rough-dry, they 
should be ironed under a damp cloth. It is better to wash them 
some day by themselves, when washing and ironing can be done at 
once. 

To Wash Delicate Muslins. — Put three pints of wheat bran and 
a handful of salt into a loose bag, and boil half an hour in six quarts 
of soft water. Use this water for washing muslins or lawns with 
delicate colors, keeping at hand the bag of bran to use instead of 
soap, on any soiled spot that will not yield to slight rubbing. Rinse 
the muslin in clear water and dry quickly in the shade. Many colors 
in calico goods, which are injured by using the most delicate soap, 
can be safely washed if wheat bran ( or, if more convenient, wheat 
flour) is boiled and used instead. 

When washing cambrics, do not allow soap to come in contact 
with the fabric. 

To Wash Silk Handkerchiefs. — Wash them in cold rain-water 
with a little curd soap ; then rinse them in rain-water — cold — slightly 
colored with stone-blue ; wring well, and stretch them out on a mat- 
tress, tacking them out tightly. They will look as good as new if 
carefully washed. 

A TEASPOONFUL of Spirits of ammonia added to the rinse-water will 
make rusty black goods look as good as new. 



THE LAUNDRY. 29 5 

Tnt use of soda or lime in washing clothes is dangerous. They 
are certain to rot them in time. Borax is the only safe article. 

White Cashmeres may be washed to look like new in cold water 
with white soap; rinse in cold water, with a little bluing in the water; 
iron damp, and use a moderately warm but not hot iron. 

Silk neckties can be washed in rain-water, to one pint of which 
add a teaspoonful of white honey and one of hartshorn. Do not 
squeeze but let them drip, and when nearly dry press between folds 
of cloth. 

A FAMOUS washing fluid is made by boiling one pound of sal-soda 
with half a pound of unslaked lime in a gallon of water twenty min- 
utes. Drain off when cool, and put the liquid in a stone jar. Put a 
teacupful in the water in which soiled white clothes are soaked ; well 
rinse in warm water, and soap all the seams and solid parts thoroughly; 
then put the clothes in a boiler of cold water, with which a second 
cup of the fluid has been incorporated. Let them boil for a few 
minutes, and rinse in tepid water. By this method clothes are made 
beautifully white with little labor and no detriment, unless they are 
very delicate and trimmed with fine lace. 

For washing black or navy blue linens, the following receipt is 
an excellent one : Take two potatoes, grated into tepid soft water 
(after having them washed and peeled), into which a teaspoonful of 
ammonia has been put. Wash the linens in this, and rinse them in 
cold, blue water. Dry in the shade. They will need no starch, and 
should be dried and ironed on the wrong side. It is said that an in- 
fusion of hay will preserve the natural color in buff linens, and an 
infusion of bran will do the same for brown linens and prints. 

Linen can be washed beautifully by using refined borax instead 
of soda as a washing-powder. One large handful of borax is used to 
every ten gallons of water, and the saving of soap is about one-half 
For laces and cambrics an extra quantity is used. Borax softens the 
hardest water and does not injure the linen. 

To Wash Silk Stockings. — The best way to wash all silk stock- 
ings is to make a good lather of curd soap and rain-water ; use it 



296 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

nearly cold, and then wash each stocking separately, rubbing as little 
as possible. Rinse in clear, soft water ; squeeze out the wet as much 
as possible in a soft cloth ; do not wring the stockings ; wrap each 
one in a dry cloth, and when almost dry rub them with a piece of 
flannel always the same way. A small quantity of liquid ammonia 
should be added to the lather when black stockings are to be 
washed. 

Another way to Wash Silk Stockings. — Make a strong lather 
with boiling water and curd soap. Leave it to get almost cold, then 
divide it into two parts. Wash the stockings well in one of the 
lathers, pressing them up and down, but avoid rubbing as much as 
possible. Squeeze out the wet, and then wash them in the second 
lather, in which a few drops of gin may be poured. Do not rinse in 
fresh water, but squeeze out the wet very carefully without wringing. 
Lay them out flat on a piece of fine linen, and roll them up tightly 
until almost dry, then rub with a roll of flannel. Black stockings 
should be washed in a cool lather of plain white soap and rain water, 
with a little ammonia mixed in it. Keep from the air while drying 
by rolling in a cloth ; do not wring, but press the moisture well out. 
Borax and water form a good rinse. 

How to do up Lace Curtains. — First take them down and give 
them a good shaking, then rub them through two waters or pound 
and rub them ; put in a pillow-case to boil, which prevents their 
being torn ; suds and rinse in bluing water and dry. Choose a warm, 
sunshiny day to starch them. Take quilting-frames out in the sun, 
place them upon four chairs (the same as for a quilt) and pin a sheet 
on them ; use silver gloss starch and make a cooked starch, bluing 
it a little ; starch two pieces and pin on the sheet together stretching 
them lengthwise as far as possible ; then pin the edges as near as 
two inches before the edges are quite dry (the middle dries first) ; take 
them on the ironing-sheet and smooth them nicely. 

When washing fine laces, do not use starch at all in the last 
water in which they are rinsed ; put in a little fine white sugar ; dis- 
solve it thoroughly, and the result will be pleasing. 



THE LAUNDRY. 297 

Salt should never be used in starch. Although it gives the Unen 
a good appearance and makes it iron smoothly, it surely destroys 
the fabric. 

Hard or hot water should never be used in washing or rinsing 
any woollen goods. Moderately warm suds — never using any soap 
directly on the goods if possible — with several rinsings in lukewarm 
water, will cleanse sufficiently. Press and squeeze woollen goods, 
but do not wring them. When squeezed dry, shake them out so as 
to avoid wrinkles. 

The Virtues of Borax. — The washerwomen of Holland and Bel- 
gium, so proverbially clean, and who get up their linen so beautifully 
white, use refined borax as washing-powder, instead of soda, in the 
proportion of one large handful of borax powder to about ten gal- 
lons of boiling water ; they save in soap nearly half All of the large 
washing establishments adopt the same mode. For laces, cambrics, 
etc., an extra quantity of the powder is used, and for crinolines (re- 
quiring to be made stiff) a strong solution is necessary. Borax, being 
a neutral salt, does not in the slightest degree injure the texture of 
the linen. Its effect is to soften the hardest water. 

Old boot-tops lined make excellent iron-holders. 

Use wire rope for clothes-line. It saves annoyance, is cheaper in 
the long run, and much more convenient. 

In putting tubs away set them so that no two handles will come 
together, and keep them in a damp place, or you will find only a pile 
of staves when you go to use them in the Monday's wash. 

To Remove Mildew. — Soak the parts of the cloth that are mil- 
dewed in two parts of chloride of lime to four parts of water for about 
two hours, or till the mildew has disappeared ; then thoroughly rinse 
it in clear water. 

Sour milk removes iron rust from white goods. 

To make silk which has been wrinkled appear exactly like new, 
sponge it on the surface with a weak solution of gum-arabic or white 
glue, and iron on the wrong side. 

To DO UP Black Silk. — Boil an old kid glove, cut up in small 



298 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

shreds, in a pint of water, till the water is reduced to a half-pint, then 
sponge the silk with it ; fold it down tight, and, ten minutes after, 
iron it on the wrong side, while wet. The silk will retain its soft- 
ness and lustre, and yet at the same time have the " body " of new 
silk. 

To Keep Silk. — Silk goods should not be folded in white paper, 
as the chloride of lime used in bleaching the paper will impair the 
color of the silk. Brown or blue paper is better. White satin dresses 
should be pinned up in blue paper, with coarse brown paper on the 
outside, sewed together on the edge. Silk intended for dresses 
should not be kept in the piece long, as lying in folds causes it to 
crack or split, particularly if thickened with gum. 

To Renovate Silks. — Sponge faded silks with warm water and 
soap ; then rub them with a dry cloth on a flat board ; afterward iron 
them on the inside with a smoothing-iron. Old black silks may be 
improved by sponging them with spirits. In this case the ironing 
may be done on the right side, thin paper being spread over to pre- 
vent glazing. 

Try pure benzine to remove stains from hair-cloth furniture. 

To take out Scorch. — If anj' article has been scorched in iron- 
ing, lay it where bright sunshine will fall directly upon it. It will 
take it out entirely. 

Putting away Clothes. — Before putting away summer or winter 
clothes, mend, clean, brush, shake well, fold smoothly, sprinkle gum- 
camphor on every fold and on the bottom of trunks or closets. Fine 
dresses, cloaks, etc., should be wrapped in sheets or towels separately, 
and, as far as possible, be laid away lightly. 

To Remove Stains from Linen. — Tartaric acid or salts of lemon 
will quickly remove stains from linen. Put less than a half-teaspoon- 
ful of salts or acid in a tablespoonful of water, wet the stain with it, 
and lay it in the sun for at least an hour ; wet it once or twice in the 
time with cold water. If not entirely out after the first trial, repeat, 
and lay it again in the sun. 

To Remove Grease from Silk^ Cotton, Linen, or Worsted 



THE LAUNDRY. 2$9 

Goods. — Rub magnesia freely on both sides of silk or worsted goods, 
and hang away. Benzine, ether, or soap will take out spots from 
silk, but the goods must not be rubbed. A towel folded several 
times should be laid under the silk, so as to absorb the grease. Oil 
of turpentine or benzine will remove spots of paint, varnish or pitch 
from white or colored cotton or woollen goods. After using, it should 
be washed in soap-suds. 

Cream of Tartar rubbed upon soiled white kid gloves cleanses 
them well. 

Hartshorn, rubbed on silk or woollen garments, will restore the 
color without injuring them. 

Fly-spots can be removed with a camel's-hair brush dipped into 
spirits of wine, and then applied to the spot. 

Crape can be stiffened by holding it over potatoes or rice while 
boiling, and then let it dry by the fire. 

Gin is an excellent thing to restore rusty crape (and it is perhaps 
the best use that gin can be put to). Dip the crape in it, and let it 
get well saturated, then clap it till dry, and smooth it out with a 
moderately hot iron. 

Water-spots may be removed from black crape by clapping it until 
dry. If dried before the spot was noticed, it will need to be dampened 
and then clapped in the hands. 

Sand-paper is the best polisher for smoothing-irons. It removes 
all roughness and starch. 

Bar-soap should be kept in a dry place several weeks before using. 
It will last much longer. 

Spirits of Turpentine is good to take grease or drops of paint 
out of cloth. Apply it till the grease can be scraped off. 

Feathers may be cleaned by dipping them into hot water. Dry 
by shaking. 

Feathers may be bleached by exposure to the vapor of burning 
sulphur — sulphurous acid — in a moist atmosphere, but it is necessary 
to remove the oily matters from them before they can be satisfactorily 
so bleached. This may be accomplished by immersing them for a 



300 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

short time in good naphtha or benzine, rinsing in a second vessel of 
the same, and thoroughly drying by exposure to the air. This treat- 
ment does not injure the feathers. 

To take out tar, paint, or resin, from either linen or woollen, 
pour a little alcohol on the place and let it soak half an hour, and 
rub gently. 

To Bleach Hose. — Strong chlorine water applied only to the 
stains on white hose, and well rinsed afterward, will bleach them 
nicely. 

Grease-spots may be removed from either silk or woollen fabrics 
by making a paste of calcined magnesia or carbonate of magnesia 
and water, and puttioL^ it on with a brush. Let it dry in a warm 
place, and remove the dried mass carefully with a knife and dry, clean 
brush ; if necessary, repeat the operation till the spot has disappeared. 
The use of a hot iron on the dried mass hastens the operation ; but 
it is dangerous, as it colors the grease spot brown. 

Cloth garments can be cleaned by wetting a sponge in warm 
water, and after squeezing it until, nearly dry, sponge one place after 
another until the garment has been cleansed. All dust and soil will 
be absorbed by the sponge, and unless there is very much soil pure 
water is better than anything else. By repeating the operation of 
sponging several times, and each time wrapping it in a piece of blacl<: 
alpaca, the cleansing will be entirely effected, and the goods will 
look fresher than if any kind of liquids had been added to the water. 

To Remove Fruit-stains. — In the season of fruits the napkins 
used at table, and often the handkerchiefs and other articles, will be- 
come stained. Those who have access to a good drug store can pro- 
cure a bottle of Javelle water. If the stains are wet with this before 
the articles are put into the wash they will be completely removed. 
Those who cannot get Javelle water can make a solution of chloride 
of lime. Four ounces of the chloride of lime are to be put into a quart 
of water in a bottle, and after thorough shaking allow the dregs to 
settle. The clear liquid will remove the stains as readily as Javelle 
water, but in using this one precaution must be observed. Be care- 



THE LAUNDRY. 30I 

tul to thoroughly rinse the article to which this solution has been 
applied in clear water before bringing it in contact with soap. When 
Javelle water is used this precaution is not necessary, but with the 
chloride of lime liquid it is or'the articles will be harsh and stiff 

To Color Brown (i). — Take a peck of hemlock bark steeped in brass 
and a little alum to set the color; after the goods are taken out 
dip in lime-water ; this makes a dark tan color. If something darker 
is wished, dip the goods in a weak black dye, then put in the brown 
dye. 

To Color Brown (2). — i lb. catechu, i oz. of blue vitriol, 2 ozs. of 
bichromate potash ; dissolve the catechu and vitriol together, boil a 
few moments and then add the rags, and boil twenty minutes, wring 
out and put in a kettle with the potash-water, and dye fifteen minutes, 
then rinse in clear, cold water. 

For starched fringe of tidies, etc., instead of straightening the 
fringe after ironing, fold the article, so that all the fringe will be to- 
gether in a line, dip fringe in hot water, shake well, fold in the ironed 
creases and place on smooth surface to finish drying. 

Brush silk with a piece of cotton velvet rolled up tight. For 
washing, pour a pint of boiling water on a tablespoonful of alcohol. 
Let it stand till tepid, and sponge the goods with it. 

To Bleach Cotton. — A very good way to bleach cotton-cloth is 
to soak it in buttermilk for a few days. Another way is to make a 
good suds ; put from one to two tablespoonfuls of turpentine into it 
before putting the clothes in. Wash as usual, wringing from the boil 
and drying without rinsing. By using one tablespoonful of turpen- 
tine in the first suds on washing-days, it will save half the labor of 
rubbing, and the clothes will never become yellow, but will remain a 
pure white. 

Scouring-balls to Remove Grease from Cloth. — Soft-soap and 
Fuller's earth, of each half a pound ; beat them well together in a 
mortar, and form into cakes. The spot, first moistened with water, 
is rubbed with a cake . and allowed to dry, when it is well rubbed 
with a little warm water, and afterward rinsed or rubbed off clean. 



302 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

To Take Wax or Grease Out of Cloth. — Hold a red-hot iron 
— a poker will do — within an inch of the cloth, and in a few minutes 
the wax will evaporate, leaving a dark spot. Then fold heavy brown 
paper and put it on both sides of the spot, and press with an iron. 
If any stain remains, wipe it over with a piece of woollen cloth saturated 
in benzine or alcohol. 

To color drab, take willow-bark and a little copperas. 

To color gray, put in some blue vitriol with the drab dye. 

The glossy stiffness of a black hat is raade with " milliner's glue." 
It can be had at the drug stores. 

Cotton rags can be colored a fast brown with a dye of butternut 
bark, adding )^ pound of madder to a kettleful of dye. They will 
not fade. 

To Revive Old Kid Gloves, make a thick mucilage by boiling 
a handful of flaxseed ; add a little dissolved soap ; then, when the 
mixture cools, with a piece of white flannel wipe the gloves, previously 
fitted to the hand ; use only enough to take off the dirt, without 
wetting through the glove. 

Bleaching Process. — Two pounds of sal-soda and half a pound 
of chloride of lime. Put half a gallon of water to the lime and let 
it stand all night. In the morning dissolve the soda in three and a 
half gallons of water ; add to the lime-water and strain. Immerse the 
cloth in boiling suds ; then take out and put directly into the mix- 
ture ; leave it in for half an hour, then rinse the muslin thoroughly 
and lay upon the grass or snow, or hang upon a line in the sun. To 
make it very white, dampen occasionally and leave it out for two or 
three days. 

Starch (very fine). — Two tablespoonfuls of starch wet in cold 
water ; add one teaspoonful each of gum arabic, white wax and fine 
salt; pour on one quart of boiling water; boil ten minutes, then 
strain ; add two more tablespoonfuls of starch wet in cold water to 
the strained starch. If any is left over it can be kept for next time ; 
it will be good though thin as water. If a polishing iron is used after 
the usual ironing the clothes will look like new. 



THE LAUNDRY. 3O3 

The Care of Towels. — Never put a new towel in the wash until 
t'ou have overcast the fringed edge. The use of this is obvious the 
moment one is told of it, though a dozen towels might be worn out 
before one would discover it. If, when towels are washed, the fringe 
is shaken well before they are hung up to dry, the fresh appearance 
will be preserved for a long time. If vigorously shaken, that is all 
that is necessary ; otherwise it is best to have the laundress whip the 
fringe over the clean back of a kitchen chair. This is much better 
than any combing process.. Besides, it does not wear the fringe so 
much. Towels with handsome, bright borders should never be boiled, 
or allowed to lie in very hot water ; they should not be used till they 
are so much soiled that they need vigorous rubbing to make them 
clean. A gentle rubbing in two suds and then conscientious rinsing, 
m warm water and then in cold, ought to be all that is required. 

Boiling Water will remove tea-stains and many fruit-stains ; pour 
tbe water through the stain, and thus prevent it from spreading 
through the fabric. Ripe tomatoes will remove ink and other stains 
fiom white cloth ; also from the hands. 



THE TOILET.

"A thing of beauty is a joy forever; its loveliness increases; it will never pass into 

nothingness." 

^HE old and trite saying that beauty is but skin-deep and 
ugly is to the bone is not true of the higher types of 
beauty. It may be of that ephemeral type that lives 
through the flush of youth and passes away before 
^^^^^^^^ the sunrise of life is passed. But beauty worthy of the 
name is found in the perfect outline of contour, in expression, in 
shapely lips and handsome eyes ; ana these do not pass away with 
the first years of life but live on, if their possessor wills it so, even 
until old age. The complexion is the one tell-tale feature that must 
needs be watched to keep it young, but with good health it can be 
kept attractive. Its deadly enemy is ill-health, and the standard of 
health is so far below par that women seldom have handsome com- 
plexions after their youthful days. Abundance of out-door exercise 
and frequent baths will be the best cosmetic that can be used for it, 
and these, with an even temper and plenty of occupation, will tend to 
keep it young. There are external remedies that will assist nature, 
and some of the best are here given. Madame Recamier was a 
woman so renowned for her beauty that its fame has made her historic. 
Her strongest point was her blooming complexion, and this she kept 
fresh by constant attention to it, never washing her face in cold 
water, and using none other than rain-water. It will repay any one 
who desires a good complexion to use buttermilk, the best bleacher 
ever known. It is not always possible to get it, but when it can be 
had, it is the first of cosmetics. Next after it is recommended a com- 
position made of the following ingredients : Three ounces of ground 
(304) 



THE TOILET. 3O5 

barley, one ounce of honey and the white of one egg, mixed to a paste 
and spread thickly on the cheeks, nose and forehead before going to 
bed. This must be allowed to dry on the face as far as it will, and 
then cover the cheeks with soft linen rags to protect the pillows, over 
which, however, a towel should be spread. Any woman who will 
persevere in the use of this paste a month will find her complexion 
so greatly improved that she will not regret the time and labor be- 
stowed upon it. Nothing can be accomplished without effort, and 
women, even the most persistent, neglect to follow up any attempts 
they make in this direction. It is well to say, however, that un- 
less the system is kept in good order and the bath a frequent 
luxury, there is little bengfit to be derived from cosmetics. They 
only improve the texture of the surface skin, and unless the blood 
is in healthy condition their full benefit is not obtained. Women 
owe it to themselves to be attractive, and they should seek by 
every means in their power to be healthy. This is the foundation 
of good looks. No face can be handsome that is not animated, and 
unhealthy people are rarely bright or sparkling in appearance. 
Therefore to be handsome the establishment of good health is the 
first step, and then the use of judicious cosmetics is recommended. 

To those who are unselfish enough to desire to be pleasing to 
others in looks, as they should be in manner and behavior, these few 
directions are offered, and if they awaken an interest in the matter, 
the reader can study the subject in works devoted especially to the 
art of beautifying, an art that will become more and more familiar 
to us as the interest now being manifested in aesthetics develops 
and expands. 

To Remove Wrinkles. — Put pieces of court-plaster on the face 
wherfi the wrinkles are inclined to come, just before going to bed, 
and remove in the morning. The plaster contracts the skin and 
prevents its sinking into creases and lines. It also protects and 
softens the skin. Warm water should always be used to wash the 
face in, as it keeps off wrinkles. 

To Remove Wrinkles (2). — To one fluid ounce of tincture of gum 



3o6 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

benzoin and seven fluid ounces distilled rose-water, add one-half 
ounce glycerine. Bathe face, neck, and hands with it at night, let- 
ting it dry on. Wash off in the morning with a very little pure white 
Castile soap and soft water. If the water is hard, add a little dis- 
solved borax. This is a famous cosmetic, and has been sold under 
various names. It is an excellent remedy for tan, sunburn, and 
freckles also. 

Wrinkles are painted out of faces by a process now coming into 
use. The coloring, whether white or pink, is moistened with fine, 
thin shellac varnish. Then the wrinkled parts of the skin are col- 
ored and held at a sufficient tension to smooth out the wrinkles. 
The varnish penetrates and stiffens the skin in drying, and a smooth 
surface is left. A bottle of shellac is among the toilet articles ot 
many New York women, it is claimed, and some of them have ac' 
quired a wonderful degree of skill in using it. The drawback is 
that it soon cracks, roughens, and is hard to remove. A renewal i? 
needed every day, and the result must be permanently injurious t>i 
the skin. 

Pure Glycerine hurts the skin and reddens it. Rose-water should 
be mixed with it to be efficacious. The nicest preparation for 
chapped hands is composed of quince seed and whiskey. There is 
no rule as to proportion. Put the seeds in a bottle, and pour in 
enough whiskey to cover them. As this thickens, add more whis- 
key until it is of the right consistency. This preparation dries off 
quickly, and leaves a most agreeable odor. 

Lavender Scent Bags. — Half a pound of lavender flowers free 
from stalk, half an ounce of dried thyme and mint, a quarter of an 
ounce of ground cloves and carraways, one ounce of dried common 
salt; mix them well together, and put them into silk or cambric 
bags. 

A PERFECTLY harmless cosmetic is as follows : four ounces of al- 
cohol, one ounce of gum benzoin ; mix, bottle and shake well ; let 
stand in a warm place three days, shaking occasionally ; strain, and 
to one pint of rain water put a teaspoonful of the mixture. Using 



THE TOILET. 30.7 

this in the water you wash in will render the skin smooth and 
white. 

The Turkish Bath is the best medicine women can take who 
lead sedentary lives. It is like sleep, a sweet restorer and tonic for 
both mind and body. 

Harmless Face-Powders. — Rice powder, though expensive, is 
warranted perfectly harmless. Refined chalk is the safest thing to 
use, and costs far less than if put up under some other name and 
sold in boxes. Cascarilla powder is much used by Cuban ladies, 
and is considered harmless. Wash the face with thick suds from gly- 
cerine soap,* and, when dry, dust on the powder with a puff or piece 
of chamois skin. 

To Keep the Hands from Chapping. — Use white Castile soap ; 
and always,- after washing, dry and rub thoroughly with a coarse 
towel. Sometimes the use of a little pulverized corn-starch will 
absorb the moisture and prove beneficial. 

For thoroughly Cleansing the Hair. — In a pint bottle put a 
spoonful of olive oil, and add two ounces of best spirits of ammonia 
or hartshorn ; shake ; then mix with three ounces of alcohol, and 
when thoroughly mixed fill the bottle with soft water. Remember 
to put in the order named, or you will have " stuff," and no chemical 
union at all. To apply, take a spoonful or two of this with a little 
warm water ; dip a sponge or rag in and wet the scalp thoroughly ; 
now rinse off in plenty of warm water, and you will be surprised at 
the amount of dirt, though you may have thought your head per- 
fectly clean. For the heads of young infants it is just the thing, 
as it instantly removes the dirty scurf without pain or trouble. It 
should be rather weaker for a babe than for an adult. 

Another Way of Cleaning the Scalp. — A teaspoonful of pow- 
dered borax, and a teaspoonful of spirits of hartshorn, dissolved in a 
quart of soft water and applied to the head with a soft sponge, and 
then rubbed dry with a towel, is an excellent wash for cleaning 
the scalp. Once a week is often enough to use it. 

A GOOD WASH for the head, which will remove dandruff and prevent 



308 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

the hair from falUng off, is made as follows : Put two tablespoonfuls 
of sulphur into a quart of warm rain water. As it will not readily 
dissolve it must be shaken several times daily for a week or so, when 
it will settle to the bottom. Pour off this liquid from the sulphur 
and add to it three tablespoonfuls of glycerine, when it is ready to 
use. Apply to the scalp at least once a day. 

To Disperse Freckles. — Take one ounce of lemon juice, quarter 
of a drachm of sugar ; mix and let them stand a few days in a glass 
bottle till the liquor is fit for use, then rub it on the hands and face 
occasionally. 

To Disperse Freckles (2). — Mix a pint of sour milk and a small 
quantity of horse-radish ; let the mixture stand over-night, and use 
as a wash three times a day until the freckles disappear. 

Nervous, excitable women can never have good complexions. The 
skin is affected by the emotions, as it is by cold or heat, and the 
first effort a nervous woman should make is to control herself Plenty 
of sleep is the first requisite and sure panacea. 

Pure white Castile soap is the best for toilet purposes. It is odor- 
less, and is therefore best suited for bathing purposes. 

A very pleasant perfume may be made of the following ingredi- 
ents : Take, of cloves, carraway-seed, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon and 
Tonquin beans, of each one ounce ; then add as much Florentine 
orris-root as will equal the other ingredients put together. Grind 
the whole well to powder, and then put it in little bags among 
clothing. 

Buttermilk as a Cosmetic. — Bathe the face in buttermilk, sour, 
of course. Take a soft rag, dip into a cup of buttermilk and wash 
every part of the face, neck and hands. If there has been a greater 
exposure to the sun than usual, after washing the face well squeeze 
out the cloth and just wipe the skin off, and let it remain on without 
washing till morning. You will be astonished to see how soon the 
freckles and tan will disappear. For keeping the hands white and 
the skin soft, there is nothing equal to buttermilk. When one gets 
burned with the hot sun, one or two bathings in buttermilk will 



THE TOILET. 309 

cause the smarting to cease, take out the inflammation, and render it 
comfortable quicker than any other remedy ever tried. There is 
something in the acid contained in the buttermilk that does the work. 
When one has stained fingers, with either berries, apples or nuts, it 
will remove the stains almost immediately. It is particularly cooling 
to the skin. 

Oatmeal and buttermilk together possess beautifying qualities 
which render them desirable on every toilet-table. 

Toilet Soap. — Drippings, which accumulate in almost every 
household, can be used for the grease. They should first be boiled 
in water, and then left to cool ; afterward they should be removed 
from the water and boiled alone until the water is expelled. The 
whiter the grease can be made the better the soap will be. The in- 
gredients of the soap are six pounds of sal-soda, seven pounds of 
grease, three pounds of unslacked lime, four gallons of soft water, 
and one-half pound of borax. Boil the soda and lime in the water 
until they are dissolved ; let the mixture stand over-night to settle ; 
pour off the clear lye, to which add the grease and pulverized borax, 
and boil to the consistency of honey. Take the mixture from the 
stove, stir in one ounce of oil of sassafras or lavender, and pour it 
into a tub, or, what is still better, a tight, shallow box, to cool, and 
when cold cut into bars and put on boards to dry. 

Court-plaster is made of thin silk, first dipped in dissolved isin- 
glass and dried, then dipped several times in the white of an egg and 
dried. 

A GOOD method for removing superfluous hair is as follows : Take 
a match and let it burn half down so as to get all the sulphur off; 
then pass it quickly over the lip, and it will remove every particle of 
hair. Do this about once in every two weeks and the lip will be as 
smooth as you could wish. 

To Remove Flesh-worms. — Wash with warm water and rub 
hard with a coarse towel, and then apply a little of the following 
preparation : Liquor of potassa, I oz. ; cologne, 2 ozs. ; white brandy, 
4 ozs. 



310 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

Crimping Hair. — To make the hair stay in crimp, take two penny- 
worth of gum-arabic, and add to it just enough boiling water to dis- 
solve it. When dissolved, add enough alcohol to make it rather thin. 
Let this stand all night, and then bottle it to prevent the alcohol from 
evaporating. This put on the hair at night, after it is done up in 
paper or pins, will make it stay in crimp the hottest day, and is per- 
fectly harmless. 

To persons troubled with an unpleasant breath the following 
mouth-washes will be found useful and harmless to the teeth : Tinc- 
ture of myrrh, about ten drops in a glass of water, is a pleasant 
mouth-wash, as is also a few drops of eau-de-cologne put into the 
water. Camphorated water is another remedy, although not so 
pleasant to some persons. A small piece of licorice placed in the 
mouth and kept there until it melts is often found effective when 
other methods fail. 

Preservation of the Teeth. — The importance of paying proper 
attention to the teeth cannot be overestimated. One great cause of 
the decay of the teeth is the presence of bits of food which stick be- 
tween the teeth, and then soften and ferment in the heat and moisture 
of the mouth and become acrid and injure the enamel. The enamel 
is at first slightly discolored at one point, then it gets soft, and event- 
ually a little hole forms in it, which goes on enlarging and increasing 
until the deeper structures are involved and the pulp is exposed. 
Very often the secretions of the mouth mixed with the food dry on 
the teeth and between' them, and form the so-called tartar, which is a 
powerful agent in the production of decay. 

The only way to guard against these dangers is to keep the teeth 
perfectly clean. They should never on any account be brushed less 
than twice a day. Brushing the teeth in the morning, and in the 
morning only, is not enough. When possible, they should be brushed 
after every meal, especially when animal food has been taken. The 
avocations of many people, which take them from their homes, may 
not allow them to brush their teeth after every meal, but they can at 
all events thoroughly wash out the mouth with cold water, and thus 
remove most of the food which would otherwise adhere. 



THE TOILET. 3 1 I 

The idea that frequently brushing the teeth tends to lacerate the 
gums and separate them from the roots is erroneous. The oftener 
they are brushed the better, provided always that a moderately soft 
brush be used. The teeth should, of course, be cleaned inside and 
out ; many people seem to think that as long as they clean those teeth 
which are seen they have done all that is necessary. 

The use of simple tooth-powder is to be commended. When 
there is a tendency to decay, tincture of myrrh often proves of much 
value. 

The habit of taking very hot substances into the mouth should be 
avoided, as the heat may crack the enamel. On the other hand, the 
practice of sucking ice and subjecting them to the other extreme of 
temperature is equally to be deprecated. No one who has the slightest 
respect for his teeth would use them as nut-crackers. Smoking, but 
more especially chewing, tobacco is bad for the teeth. 

It should be remembered that the preservation of the teeth is in a 
great measure dependent on the condition of the health, and this 
should accordingly be maintained in the highest possible state of 
integrity by the use of plain, nourishing food, cold bathing or spong- 
ing, and early or regular hours. 

A FINE comb loosens the dead skin of the scalp, just as friction 
rubs off the scarf-skin of the body. 

In washing hair-brushes do not use soap or hot water. Dissolve 
a teaspoonful of saleratus in tepid water, and dip the brush up and 
down in it till it is white and clean. Place it in the warm air to dry 
with the bristles down, and it will be as firm as a new brush. Harts- 
horn in tepid water is quite as efficacious, but not as convenient. A 
handful of dry meal rubbed on brushes is also excellent for cleaning 
them. It removes all grease and dust, and can be shaken out of the 
bristles easily. 

Lemon-juice and glycerine will cleanse and soften the hands. 

To Remove Pimples. — Sulphur water, i oz. ; acetated liquor of 
ammonia, y^ oz. ; liquor of potassa, i gr. ; white wine vinegar, 2 ozs. ; 
distilled water, 2 ozs. Apply twice a day. 



312 THE hearthstone; or, LIFE AT HOME. 

Care of the Hands. — A naturally fine hand is made more beauti- 
ful by care, and a hand not so greatly favored is much improved, 
without doubt, by extra attention. A visit to the manicure results 
in a treatment merely preparatory. The hands are placed for about 
ten minutes in a lukewarm solution. The flesh about the nails is 
thus softened, and is then skilfully raised from the nail and cut close 
with a pair of circular flesh-cutters. The nails are then covered with 
a deep rose-tinted pomade, which, though washed gently off in a 
minute or two, leaves its blush behind. This is succeeded by a 
grayish powder, which, in turn, is rubbed off lightly and swiftly by 
a buffer or wash leather pad, giving a fine polish to the nail. Lastly, 
the nail tips are filed into the pointed or round shape, according to 
individual fancy. The principal errors to be avoided, says the mani- 
cure, in the care of the nails is the use of the knife or scissors in 
either cleaning or cutting. The nails should never be cut, but always 
filed, and never cleaned except with something hard and smooth, 
like ivory, which cannot erase the protective lining of the nail. Of 
course, the nails should not be bitten — scarcely any one addicted to 
this nervous and vulgar habit needs to be told this. They should 
also be guarded against bruises, which are the cause of the unsightly 
white spots ; neither should the flesh about the nails be cut by one's 
self, as very sore fingers may be caused by carelessness in this par- 
ticular. The nails in prime condition should be curved and not flat; 
long and narrow, with the delicate white crescent outline at the base, 
rosy in hue and glistening like a mirror. Here then is the standard 
which the regular patrons of the manicure uphold, and more or less 
of the points constituting which may be achieved by each individual 
herself at the expense of some care and not a little time. 

If Garters are worn, it is important to know how to apply them 
with the least risk of harm. At the bend of the knee the super- 
ficial veins of the leg unite, and go deeply into the under part of the 
thigh, beneath the ham-string tendons. Thus a ligature below the 
knee obstructs all the superficial veins ; but, if the constriction is 
above, the ham-string tendons keep the pressure off the veins which 



THE TOILET. 313 

return the blood from the legs. Unfortunately, most people, in 
ignorance of the above facts, apply the garter below the knee. 

To CLEAR the complexion, take a teaspoonful of charcoal well 
mixed in water or honey for three nights, then use a simple purga- 
tive to remove it from the system. It acts like calomel, with no 
bad effects, purifying the blood more effectually than anything else. 
But some simple aperient must not be omitted, or the charcoal will 
remain in the system, a mass of festering poison, with all the impuri- 
ties it absorbs. After this course of purification tonics may be 
used. 

People inclined to embonpoint will be glad to know that a strong 
decoction of sassafras drank frequently will reduce the flesh as rapidly 
as any remedy known. Take it either iced or hot, as fancied, with a 
little sugar if preferred. A strong infusion is made at the rate of 
an ounce of sassafras to a quart of water. Boil it half an hour very 
slowly, and let it stand till cold, heating again if desired, and keeping 
it from the air. 

It is said that the water in which potatoes have been boiled with 
the skins on forms a speedy and harmless dye for the hair and eye- 
brows. The parings of potatoes before cooking may be boiled by 
themselves and the water strained off for use. Apply it with a fine 
comb dipped in the water drawn through the hair, wetting it at each 
stroke, till the head is thoroughly soaked. If the result is not satis- 
factory the first time, repeat the wetting with a sponge, taking care not 
to discolor the skin of the brow and neck.

' Blest be that spot, where cheerful guests retire, 
To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire ; 
Blest that abode, where want and pain repair. 
And every stranger finds a ready chair." 

SHE choice of friends and acquaintances is one of the 
most important processes of the human will. I call it 
a process rather than an act because it is a gradual 
and often an unconscious growth of feeling. Acquaint- 
ance ripens into friendship when there is that harmony 
of feeling and tastes in which friendship has its basis. But some 
persons are very well as acquaintances who are very undesirable as 
friends. Care, but not suspicion, should guide us in our friendships. 
But acquaintanceship easily passes into that familiarity which counts 
for friendship. Yet in inward truth people are often very intimate 
with one another and speak of and to each other as friends, old friends, 
intimate friends, and dear friends, who are not friends at all, because 
the unanimity which true friendship requires is wanting. Such 
friendships are soon broken by a hasty word or an inconsiderate 
act, and this shows their hollowness, for if the friendship be real, 
accidents and little misunderstandings could not snap it. 

There are two proverbs which pass current in the world, but which 
will scarcely bear a strict examination. One is, that " No man is a 
hero to his valet de chambre ; " the other is, that " Familiarity breeds 
contempt." But if a man be really a hero he will be one in his night- 
cap as well as in his wig. We may laugh at another person without 
despising him or feeling any contempt for him. When the old- 
fashioned camphine lamps first came into fashion, husband and wife

would sometimes look into each other's face and each exclaim to the 
other: "Why, my dear, your face is all covered with black soot," 
and the answer would be: " Why, so is yours !" Each would have 
a ridiculous appearance to the other, but it would be a mistake to say 
that at such a comical situation they loved each other less, or had 
less respect for one another. So the valet who swaddles up his old 
master's feet and head when he has a bad influenza, and administers 
his hot gruel and spirits of nitre, does not lose his respect for him 
just because in that predicament he presents a woebegone and un- 
heroic aspect. He is still the dear, kind master that he was when he 
set forth equipped into the battle of life, and his valet followed him 
with sword and baggage. The late Charles Kingsley used to say 
that " Don Quixote " was the most pathetic book he ever read. He 
must have meant that the true heroism and nobleness of the old book- 
worm, crazed with stories of knight-errantry, had a pathos in them 
which more than counterbalanced his ridiculous appearance and mis- 
takes. To Sancho Panza, at any rate, he seemed the greatest hero 
in the world, and to be his body-servant and follow him on a donkey 
through all his exploits seemed a position both of dignity and glory. 
If the proverb that " No man is a hero to his valet " were wholly 
true — for, of course, there are times when a hero is not heroic, as 
when he is battling with mosquitoes instead of the enemy — then we 
should be brought to the melancholy conclusion that heroism is not 
in the man, but in the accidents of the man, and that no character is 
so noble as to bear knowing with its robes of office taken off This 
is happily the very contrary of the truth. 

So with that other proverb, " Familiarity breeds contempt," it is 
only true when the person one becomes familiar with is really con- 
temptible, and when intimate knowledge reveals the worthlessness of 
his character. But intimate knowledge does not always make this 
revelation, for constant familiarity and intimacy with others too often 
blind us to their faults instead of opening our eyes to them. It is ■ 
with men and women of the baser sort as Pope has said of vice : 



3l6 THE HEARTHStONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

" Vice is a monster of so frightful mien 
As to be hated needs but to be seen; 
But seen too oft, familiar with its face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace." 

Familiarity certainly does not breed contempt for the good. It may 
show us their weak points and reveal our weak points to them ; but 
those weaknesses rather endear friends to each other than create con- 
tempt on either side. " With all thy faults I love thee still," is a trite 
quotation, but it truly describes what intimacy does when there is 
real friendship. 

It is not desirable, however, to begin an intimacy with persons of 
weaker character than ourselves. They will oftener pull us down to 
their level than we succeed in raising them to ours. Some men and 
women seem to delight in a feeling of calm superiority to their friends, 
and they choose persons of less virtue or intelligence than themselves 
in order to enjoy the tranquil egotism of looking down on them. 
The conceited student says to himself, " Dr. Johnson had his Bos- 
well to take notes of admiration of him and ask his judgment and 
advice upon all occasions ; therefore all superior minds should have 
an inferior for their bosom friend. I am a superior mind, and poor, 
dear So-and-so is very simple and thinks a deal of me. I will be 
Johnson and he shall be my Boswell." But the patronized, snubbed 
and paraded follower, who in his simple heart loves his grand friend 
and feels honored by his friendship, is sometimes a better if not a 
wiser man than his conceited, condescending friend. 

What a strange volume of reminiscences could every man and 
woman compose in their own silent hours of reflection and introspec- 
tion, if they recalled all the friendships they had formed through life 
and analyzed the causes that had led to them ! They would think 
of one, perhaps, who had really not much in common with them in 
thoughts and aspirations, but with whom familiarity had bred friend- 
ship, not contempt. They were school-girls or school-boys together, 
and some accident, perhaps a quarrel over lessons or play, made 
them warm friends for life. They met, perhaps, on a steamboat or a 



COMPANY IN THE HOME. 3I7 

Street car, and some trifling occurrence made them first bowmg ac- 
quaintances, then visitors at each other's homes, then hand-shaking 
and hearty friends. Sometimes taking another person's hat or um- 
brella by mistake — though umbrellas, as a rule, are not taken by 
mistake — led to apologies and explanations, and these to acquaint- 
anceship, and that to intimacy. 

How hard it is to avoid being either friends or foes to one who 
lives next door to us, or has rooms in the same house, or lives 
directly opposite, and whom we find ourselves unconsciously sur- 
veying through our window when he or she is contemplating us in 
the same way and time ! How hard it is to escape having some feel- 
ing toward every one we are brought in contact with, the butcher, 
baker or grocer who supplies our physical needs, the partner with 
whom we dance at a ball, the person who lends us a hymn-book 
at church, or shows us the place we are looking for ! The footman 
becomes familiar by bringing us letters frequently, and the car-driver 
by taking up our fare so often. A French exile once wrote to the 
third Napoleon asking pardon and permission to return to France, 
on the ground that he had been the first to lay his hand upon him 
and arrest him when he was made prisoner and shut up in the fortress 
of Hafft. The emperor could not resist the plea of such familiarity 
as this, and at once made out his pardon, which he sent him with an 
autograph letter. Every day that dawns upon us may bring us a 
new acquaintance or end an old friendship. We jostle each other 
and tread upon each other's feet in the hurly-burly of life. All our 
friends were once strangers to us, and any stranger may become our 
friend. 

The solitary are " set in families ; " households are composed of 
individuals, and communities of households. " Man is a gregarious 
animal," said the old logician, and abhors isolation as much as sheep 
do. The household is a sheepfold, and in the fields of life the hu- 
man sheep must graze together and hold the pasturage in common. 
But scabby sheep are avoided by the healthy ones, and morally un- 
wholesome persons should be avoided by families and individuals 



ji8 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

from an instinct of self-preservation and for the protection of the 
young. "Avoid bad company," is a precept which needs to be fol- 
lowed as much inside as outside of the home. Be courteous, there- 
fore, to every one with whom you have to do, but do not be weak 
enough to allow any one to thrust their company upon you against 
your own inclinations. 

As soon as you settle in a neighborhood, the gossip of the place 
is sure to pounce upon you, and will gain an entrance into your 
house by strategy in order to add to her stock in trade of tittle-tattle. 
That mischief-making person must be kept out if you would live in 
peace with your neighbors. You must let her severely alone, and 
make her understand, once for all, that she must let you and yours 
alone. " But how can I do it ?" you ask. " She visits everywhere; 
phe will keep on calling; how can I shut my door in her face?" 
Hundreds of "home rulers," the wives and mothers whose voice is 
absolute as to who shall be welcome guests and who shall be ex- 
cluded, and against whose wishes neither husband nor son would 
bring home a friend, deceive themselves when they ask this question. 
The fact is that the difficulty is not so much in keeping the tale- 
bearer out as in the unacknowledged truth that they rather like her 
to " drop in," though they pretend the contrary, and will not own it 
even to themselves. Curiosity about other people is in their minds 
as well as on her tongue. They are " afraid of hurting her feel- 
ings," when the fact is she has no feelings worth speaking about. 

It has been said by more than one philosopher who has made 
human nature his study that, however much they may conceal the 
truth from themselves and others, people generally are pleased to 
hear of the misfortunes of their neighbors. This does not arise from 
malevolence or ill-nature, but the domestic or business mishaps of 
others give them something to talk about, reflect upon, turn over and 
over in their minds with all the causes and effects connected with it. 
" I always said so; " "Just as I predicted;" " It is the old story of 
pride going before destruction," etc., etc. — these expressions are a 
relief to the speaker's feelings, and show that the bad news is quite 



COMPANY ]N THE HOME. 319 

exciting and breaks the humdrum monotony of every-day thought 
^nd life. 

As people in large cities take up the newspaper the first thing in 
the morning to read of wars and rumors of wars, murders, burglaries, 
failures in business, railway accidents, shipwrecks, fires, scandals in 
high life, broken heads and drunkenness in low life, balls, plays, new 
fashions, and what the comet has been doing with its tail since it was 
last visible, so in the smaller village circles neighbors run into each 
other's cottages to tell the wondrous news of an assault committed 
by Huggins on Muggins, a proposal made by the bashful dry-goods 
young man for the hand of Miss Sophronia Mineral, the school- 
teacher, or the awful fact that a husband who kept late hours had 
been locked out by his judicious spouse, and had been found with 
his nose frost-bitten and no hat on his head sleeping on a tombstone 
in the village churchyard. All these tragic or melodramatic inci- 
dents pass from tongue to tongue, and such remarks as, " Who'd 
have thought it!" "Bless me, you make my blood run cold ! " "Just 
as I expected ; so it has come at last ! " " I always said so ! " and the 
like, prove beyond a doubt that the news is a nervine, a tonic, an 
eye-opener, an ear-tickler, and a tongue-loosener to everybody in the 
place, except the unfortunate subject of their conversation. The tell- 
tale who carries the story from house to house, and touches it up 
with the paint-brush of her imagination as she goes along, is a wel- 
come guest wherever she goes. People may not like her for her- 
self, but they make much of her for the news she brings. It is no 
use reasoning with them, for they always have the excuse at hand 
that they are not free agents in the matter and cannot refuse to listen 
to her stories. The only cure for these itching ears is in being them- 
selves made victims of the gossip's tongue, instead of lofty and com- 
miserating critics 01 other people and their affairs. They learn to 
shut their door against scandal only when it has assailed the happi- 
ness of their own fireside. Then they begin to see that talebearers 
and scandal-mongers are not good company for a peaceful, bright 
and contented home, 



320 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

But these busybodies and talebearers, concerning whom every one 
who receives their visits ought to bear in mind that they will carry 
away fresh material for gossip from what they see and hear during 
their visit, are not the only unprofitable and untimely visitors who 
disturb the order and harmony of home. Good-natured and harm- 
less persons may sometimes be great bores to others without know- 
ing it. That which distinguishes one's own home from hotel and 
boarding-house life is its privacy, and freedom from the restraint 
which the presence of those who are not members of the family neces- 
sitates. Before guests, who are as familiar with our next-door neigh- 
bors as with ourselves, we have to be on our guard against an 
incautious word, which repeated elsewhere might do mischief, how- 
ever innocently meant. Many amiable but talkative persons never 
think of this. They repeat at one house what they have heard at 
another about the private affairs of individuals and families. 

How often dp we wonder at the distant greeting and changed 
manner of a neighbor, and worry our minds in asking ourselves what 
possible offense we can have given ! Sometimes friends who were 
once intimate grow colder and colder to each other, until at last they 
pass each other in the street without recognition. One of the two 
parties may remain in ignorance all the time as to how the estrange- 
ment began. All that he or she knows is that their greeting did 
not meet with the same warm-hearted response as formerly ; that the 
friend only bowed instead of stopping to shake hands as heretofore, 
and that by degrees the recognition became more and more distant 
until it ceased altogether. Little matters are often far more difficult 
to explain and set right than great ones. It is neither easy nor pleas- 
ant to ask for an explanation of another person's manner. One is 
never quite sure at first that the coldness may not have been acci- 
dental, or that we' imagined another's manner changed to us when it 
really was not so. It makes a man or woman look foolish to ask 
for an explanation of an imaginary slight. The mere question places 
us at a disadvantage, and if the other party is conceited we run the 
risk of gratifying their self-respect at the expense of our own. If 



COMPANY ]N THE HOME. 321 

they are sly as well as conceited, they may now make a case against 
us, which may be just what they want to do. They may say of us 
to others that really we are so ridiculously sensitive that if they don't 
go into ecstasies on meeting us we fancy they want to cut our ac- 
quaintance. This makes us feel more annoyed than before, and then, 
if they are malevolent and like to wound our feelings, as well as 
superior to us in cunning, they may not only say to others that we 
are always fancying ourselves slighted, but they may say to us, point 
blank, when we ask why they are not as cordial as formerly: " Really, 
indeed, upon my word, you surprise me by the question. Upon my 
word, deeply, of course, as I esteem you and all that, and admire 
your family and all that, I have something else to do than to be 
always thinking about you. I cannot always have the exact warmth 
that you require. I am so extremely sorry that my manner should 
have made you unhappy. Positively, ju.st tell me what degree of 
the thermometer of greeting you wish me to keep up," and so on, 
until we go home ready to burst with humiliation and annoyance, 
which is just what our cunning acquaintance desired. We have put 
ourselves in their power by asking the reason of a slight which was, 
no doubt, both intentional and malicious, but which it is the easiest 
thing in the world for them to pretend unconsciousness about. Now, 
of course, we are compelled to vindicate our own independence and 
self-respect by being cold to them, but this only puts us still further 
in the wrong if they are craftier than we are. They can make us 
ridiculous to the neighborhood by pretending that we are so sensi- 
tive that we must be treated with^ the greatest care and punctilio for 
fear we should take offense. Many kind-hearted, unselfish persons 
are put upon a rack of social torture by just such accidents as these. 
And how did it begin ? Why, the chances are that at our own fire- 
side we unguardedly said something about the other party's mind 
or manners, forgetting that Miss Tattle or Mr. Teller, who happened 
to be calling upon us at the time, would be sure to repeat it until 
it reached the ears of the person spoken of, even if it were not carried 
direct. 



322 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

In civilized places, where men don't carry loaded revolvers at 
noonday and shoot each other for an idle word, a downright, hearty 
quarrel is better than this underground misunderstanding. A true 
lady or gentleman is always ready to apologize when they are in the 
wrong, and to take back an offensive speech inadvertently made. 
Thackeray went the right way to work on his visit to this country 
when he was told that a Dr. Griswold, a writer, had spoken of him 
as a snob. Meeting him at dinner and being introduced to him he 
extended his hand frankly, and said : " I understand, Dr. Griswold, 
that you have called me a snob. Now, sir," — drawing himself up to 
his full height, which was over six feet — " look at me and tell me, 
do I look like a snob ? " There is nothing like having it out with an 
adversary before the wound has time to mortify or the injury— real 
or supposed — to fester or grow inwards. 

A harmless visitor to our home may do a deal of harm to us and 
ours, as well as to others whom we think well of and are glad to 
know. It is not that Miss Tattle and Mr. Teller really wished to 
make mischief If they did they should be labelled talebearer and 
mischief-maker and kept out of our house at any cost — even to the 
point of telling them that their visits are not desired — but they do it 
without malice, just for want of something better to talk about, and 
because they see it gratifies the natural curiosity of the idle. 

"The idle!" That is just the class who love scandal, for those 
who have their hands full of work have no time to be busy with 
other people's affairs. Industry, however unremunerative, is never 
unproductive of good if it only keeps us out of mischief And what 
social mischief can at all compare, in the unhappiness it causes, with 
the talebearing of small communities ! 

This industry is the only and the effective safeguard against hav- 
ing the privacy of your home invaded by callers who, having nothing 
to do themselves, make frequent visits to all their neighbors, whom 
they are likely to find at leisure, to talk and listen to them. 

Professional persons have their reception hours ; private families 
should have them also. Let the gossip and the mere vacant idler 



COMPANY IN THE HOME. 323 

understand that life is to you more valuable than that you should 
fritter away its morning and evening hours. If they think that their 
vital machinery is going to last forever, let them know that you are 
alive to the truth that you are mortal, and must do with regularity 
and industry the work you find to do. How many weak-minded 
housewives are always saying, " I was just going to do this or that 
important piece of work," when Mrs. Fuss or Miss Feathers came in 
and stayed so long chatting that I had to give it up !" Better sweep 
good Mrs. Fuss away with your broom and blow the airy Miss 
Feathers up the chimney than allow them to prevent you doing your 
day's proper work. Better be " talked to death," if talk would only 
be kind enough to make an end of the listener when it will not make 
an end of itself, than be talked out of one's works and ways. Don't 
hurt anybody else's feelings if you can help it, but be firm and screw 
your courage to the sticking point of saying : " You will really have 
to excuse me, but this is my hour for work, and I must postpone the 
pleasure of a chat until I am off duty!' Be off duty, my sisters, as 
little as you can. Make your life as full of duties as you can. 
Utilize all the hours you can, so will you neither give nor take 
offense ; you will compel the respect of your neighbors and shut the 
gossip's mouth. Your sleep will be healthy and sound, undisturbed 
by the self-accusing thoughts of the idler and the horrid nightmares 
of the social scandal-monger. 

When once it becomes known to your neighbors that you regard 
life as intended for something more than a gossips' paradise, and that 
you devote the morning and evening hours to duties and culture, 
and the afternoons to out-door exercise, the regular critics of every- 
body but themselves will, after some fierce assaults upon your privacy, 
let you severely alone. Of course, they will avenge their slighted 
conversation by pitying comments on you to each other. They will 
say you have no spirit in you and are content to let the world take 
its own course, so long as you can keep your own home tidy and 
manage your own affairs smoothly. They will call you a drudge, 
and say you have no soul. But the very best people in this world 



324 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

are those who keep their souls to themselves and work as regularly 
as if they hadn't any. It is really a great compliment to be pro- 
nounced wanting in public interest and spirit by the village gossips. 
All you care for is to be let alone by them, and the only way to 
accomplish this happy result is to keep them at a respectful distance 
with the pins and needles, the bodkins and darning-needles, and the 
domestic duties that are a woman's best protection, as they are her 
truest happiness. 

But having established order in your home by keeping yourself 
and your children free from intrusion during hours of duty and study, 
let there be times when you receive and return visits. Be glad to 
see those who are glad to see you. Be chatty and agreeable, but 
let your tongue be eloquent in speaking good of others and silent 
as to their faults. Above all, never meddle with the private affairs 
of others in your conversation, unless you are prepared that they 
should make free with yours. Let your talk be such as leaves a 
pleasant, not a sour, taste in the mouth, and cultivate the company 
of those who leave behind them pleasant and kindly impressions. 
Not only is the human voice the most tremendous of all social in- 
fluences in the world, so that the spoken word really never dies, but 
spreads in ever-widening circles of effect, but the influences of con- 
versation for good or ill upon the minds of a whole family, children 
or full grown, is most important in the conduct and happiness of life. 
The conversation must depend upon the company. It is useless to 
cast pearls before swine, or talk of literature and art, the beauties of 
scenery or the delights of reading to those who have no taste for 
them. Choose for your friends those in whose presence you feel 
cheered and improved, not those with whom every interchange of 
sentences is a labor and a weariness. Be mistress of your own house, 
and let no one use your home as they would a tavern or a club ; 
but be hospitable to the right sort of people, who know that there 
is a time to call and a time to stay away, a time for condolence or 
congratulation, and a time for silence and solitude. Sometimes all 
company is oppressive ; for not only does the heart know its own sor- 



COMPANY IN THE HOME. 325 

rows but its own joys, and one's own kith and kin, still more a stranger, 
cannot share our inmost feelings. 

When the work of the day is over and the family are all assembled 
together for a pleasant evening, the intrusion of a bore spoils every- 
thing, but the pleasant face of an agreeable friend, full of information 
and kindly sentiment, is an addition to the diffused happiness of the 
home circle. Perhaps one member of the circle is more skilled in 
some dual game, like chess, than the others, and it is a great pleasure 
when the friend drops in who is fairly a match for the chess-player. 
Or one member of the family is wrapped up in an amateur's enthu- 
siasm for painting or music or some other art, and a friend from the 
outside comes in to exchange feelings, criticisms and hopes with him 
or her about the mutual study and pursuit. Musical evenings are 
especially delightful, because music does not disturb but agreeably 
relieves the sameness of conversation and revives it by a rest when 
it begins to flag. 

The old proverb is a very true one and should never be forgotten, 
that a person is known by the company he or she keeps. So of a 
home, it is the highest praise to say that one is sure of meeting 
pleasant company in it, and it is a signboard bidding us beware 
and not seek admission when a household becomes known as a 
central depot of unpleasant rumors and a factory for social whisper- 
ings. 




HOME MEMORIES. 

" I remember, I remember, 

The house where I was born. 
The little window where the sun 

Came peeping in at morn. 
He never came a wink too soon, 

Nor brought too long a day ; 
But now I often wish the night 

Had borne my breath away ! " 

SHE sunrise after the night of darkness makes everything 
on land and sea appear wonderfully bright and vivid, 
but as the hours steal on the feelings of delight arid 
surprise pass away, and we look upon the scenes around 
us as matters of course without being strongly affected 
by them. So it is with life. The earliest scenes form the latest 
memories, and the mind's first impressions are the most deep and 
lasting. There are some people who read the beginning and the end 
of a book, but skip heedlessly over the chapters that lie between them. 
So is it often with the book of life. The years that lie between our 
childhood and old age seem commonplace and we forget a good 
many of their occurrences and experiences, but no one ever forgets 
the home where the eyes first opened on the novel scene of life, the 
human faces, the nursery, the earliest objects and associations. 

Men and women have lived to a hundred years of age and more, 
and when we come to talk to them we find their recollections of 
whole decades and epochs of their lives often very hazy and inac- 
curate. They confuse the persons and events that thronged the 
busy stage of middle life, and attribute words or actions to one per- 
son at one time that really were spoken or done by another person 
at another time. But, as we push their memory back, the nearer they 
I326) 



t3^ • ■ "*fe*tf'»Tcafc?s[^vt 




HOME MEMORIES. 32/ 

get to the fountain-head the clearer their recollections become. Ten 
thousand times ten thousand faces may have passed before their 
vision, and in the dim corridors of age they seem only like phantoms 
in a dream, but the clouds break, the sun of memory shines, and out 
of the past and turning it into the present there shines upon the old 
man or woman's vision a mother's face, blessed among women, radiant 
with tender grace beyond all others, and upon whose angel aspect 
time writes no wrinkles. Beautifully has Cowper expressed this feel- 
ing and vivid recollection of the heart's first love in his lines upon 
his mother's picture : 

"O that those lips had language I Life has passed 
With me but roughly since I heard thee last. 
Those lips are thine, — thy own sweet smile I see, 
The same that oft in childhood solaced me ; 
Voice only fails, else how '^tinct they say, 
• Grieve not, my child ; chase 11 thy fears away ! ' 
The meek intelligence of those dear eyes 
(Blest be the art that can immortalize, — 
The art that baffles time's tyrannic claim 
To quench it !) here shines on me still the same." 

It needs no canvas to recall to us a mother's face. Dust and 
decay may dim and spoil a picture, but a dear mother's image is en- 
graven on the heart, and passes from it, or rather with it, only when it 
dies. As the ej'^e recalls her looks of love, warning and consolation, 
so does the ear catch the sweet accents of her voice wafted on the 
intervening air as though it were still speaking to us. The pictures 
and figures which we see everywhere in Roman Catholic countries 
of the Madonna and child may symbolize to us, independently of their 
religious associations, the relation of the mother to the child-man or 
woman. Her arms are the everlasting arms that bear us up and on 
over the rough roads and through the blinding storms of life. Her 
eyes are always looking down upon us with a love which no one 
else can feel. It is to her tender bosom that we nestle from the 
pitiless winds of life, and in the folds of her vesture that we bury ou< 
tired heads and sink to rest. 



32b THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

But beside the mother, who is dearest of all the memories of home, 
and whose sad, pleading face has often stayed the hand from violence 
and wrong and the feet from erring from the paths of right, and the 
mind from utter atheism and disdain of life, and the heart from be- 
coming hard and dead to kindly feelings and affections, there are 
other faces that shine on us in the memories of home. Perhaps it is 
the aged grandfather, who in quavering tones called us his dear boy 
or girl, and told us wondrous stories of the days when he was young; 
or it is grandmother, who inspires us with awe of the reverence and 
duty which children showed to parents when she was a girl ; or it 
is an aunt, who gave us pocket-money when we went to see her 
during the Christmas holidays; or the kind uncle, perhaps, who, 
having no children of his own, treated us as kindly and took as great 
interest in our welfare as though he had been our father. Now 
and then a strange face, rises up before us, as that of one who had 
travelled over many lands and seas since he was our father's school- 
fellow, and whose weathen-beaten face shone with the light of happy 
reminiscences as he called our father by his Christian name, and 
talked of the old days with the books and scenes and studies familiar 
to them both. Shine out of the past, dear, kindly faces ! Break 
upon our ice-bound life with the sunshine of those hours in which 
sorrow was not, nor want and hardship, nor bereavement and the 
vacant chair. 

One face can never be forgotten by most of us. It is as necessary 
a face as though it belonged to the family in a multitude of homes. 
Shakespeare speaks of the infant in the nurse's arms. The nurse's 
face, not less than her arms, is part of our home memories. The 
good creature loved and cared for us, as we grew out of utter helpless- 
ness to the use of our limbs and the exercise of our mimic strength, as 
dearly as if she had been our mother instead of our mother's help 
and substitute. We hear much about the mothers of great men and 
the influence they have exercised over the mind and character, nor 
can this influence be overrated. But a volume might be written upon 
the nurses of great men and women whose names are unknown to 



HOME MEMORIES. 329 

fame and who are never heard of; for, except the ubiquitous, sempi- 
ternal and mythical nurses of George Washington, domestic history 
is silent upon the influence which the faithful domestic servant has 
often had upon the disposition, the imagination and the future con- 
duct of heroes and heroines. 

Brothers and sisters fill the private box in memory's theatre to 
many of us. Some are remembered with pain and grief too deep for 
words, and others with a swelling sense of grateful pride at the noble 
fulfilment they have made of early promise. It is as though we had 
fought a brother's battles when we look back upon his scars of 
honorable warfare. His success is a bright flower-bed bathed in sun- 
shine in the story of our humble lives. How proud the mother was 
of him, her daring, generous, patient, self-sacrificing boy ! If there 
is a weak brother in most large families there is generally a strong 
one also, who preserves the balance of family qualities and the honor 
of its record. 

Objects as well as persons, though not so vividly, once seen and 
loved in childhood, and from having been associated with the dawn 
of life's perceptions, become unfading furniture in the memories of 
home. Who does not sometimes seem to handle again the old 
fishing-rod, the antique box, the massive walking-stick, the heredi- 
tary punch-bowl, that were heirlooms in the family ! Even an old 
bunch of keys may be remembered because of the rooms that it un- 
locked, some seldom visited and oppressing the spirits with an inde- 
finable gloom ; others light, cheerful, bright in color, cosy to sit in, 
from whose walls the old heroic sires and matrons of our lineage, or 
the grand persons of the world's history, looked down on us with 
placid condescension. One key, perhaps, unlocked a store-closet full 
of dainty dishes and rich preserves, and when we heard it turn in the 
housekeeper's hand we knew that company was coming to dinner, 
and sighed the sigh of joyful anticipation at the remnants of jam or 
jelly that would certainly find their way at last to our appreciative 
and prematurely smacking lips. For surely the smacking of the lips 
is one of the luxurious memories of home. 



330 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

The garden and the garden gate are often prominent objects in the 
picture of home memories, not for the Mauds who have met their 
lovers there and plighted their juvenile affections to each other, but 
because some of the sweetest home memories are associated with 
flowers and fields and shady trees and green velvet lawns. The first 
paradise of mankind was a garden, and the "sweet garden toil " the 
earliest business and pleasure of our first parents in primeval Eden. 
From that day to this, the flowers of the home garden make perfume 
and beauty for us. Home memories bring back the withered roses 
and violets, lilacs and lilies. Perhaps, when a child, we had a flower- 
bed of our own, and a happy rivalry to keep it in better order than 
our brothers and sisters did theirs may have been one of our earliest 
and highest ambitions. 

Was there a horse that bent his head to our caresses and looked 
with faithful, solemn eyes at us as we spoke to it by name ? was 
there a dog and did we hope, like the poor Indian, that when 

" Transpl.inted to that equal sky 
Our faithful dog would bear us company? " 

They have their place in the retrospective picture. They are not for- 
gotten. Carlo's bark and Dobbin's trot echo down the road of our 
remembrance. And if we "had a grandmother who had a donkey," 
that donkey will assert its place in our collection, remembered, per- 
haps, because it threw us gently off" its back or philosophically ate 
turnips from our hand. 

But in the winter days and evenings when the snow was falling, 
about which such strange accounts were given us in the nursery, 
when out-door amusements were impossible to our little frames, and 
neither dog nor horse, donkey nor goat could share our pastimes, 
what object rises to our memories as most sacred to early musings 
and imaginings ? Surely, it is the open fire, in whose red coals or 
dying embers we beheld chariots and horsemen, and saw in mimic 
and flickering splendor domes, terraces and spires, faces with eyes of 
fiery brilliancy, hands,^ar.ms, trees, houses, crowns of glory and of

burning gold. Those who visit our country from more temperate 
dimes, where winter's reign is not so long and stern, wonder that we 
have stoves, that are not ornaments but iron lumber in our houses, 
instead of the cheery open fires of European households. They for- 
get, or have not learned, that our North American winter has com- 
pelled this change ; but as a matter of aesthetic appearance and asso- 
ciation the stove is undoubtedly an abomination, de.structive of poetic 
reverie and suggestive only of the bare metallic hardness of human 
life, not of the fringe of glory and beauty that should surround it. 
The dear old grate with its red, glowing coals seemed to record "the 
story of our lives from day to day ; " the gigantic stove records nothing 
but the ironmonger's prosaic trade. No poet ever yet drew inspira- 
tion from a stove. It may be a fine self-feeder, but it is no soul- 
feeder. It is of the earth earthy, and its range of suggestiveness 
has no horizon except pots and pans. But in the fires of the old 
nursery of childhood's home, what solemn processions, what grand 
illuminations have we seen ! In the twilight hour, before the candles 
or the lamps were lit, the child-philosopher and poet has read in the 
clear trembling of the red live coals many an allegory and parable, 
many a history and prophecy of life. Its warmth, so gradual in its 
comfort, has soothed each nerve and limb. Its bright aspect, re- 
flected by the flickering lights and shadows on the walls, now bath- 
ing a window-pane with " dim, religious light," now lighting up some 
far corner which had lain in shadow, is full of teaching. It is just 
mysterious and checkered enough to give a cosy, grateful sense of 
peace at home in contrast with the wind and storm without. It 
touches with a sudden gleam the heart of the solitary gazer, and re- 
minds it of the wanderers and outcasts who are shivering with the 
winter's cold and have no fires in their bare garrets. Upward and 
onward the mind soars into the mysteries of the fire, an element so 
grand that the Persians worshipped it as God, and Christianity has 
- borrowed from it the most vivid descriptions of divine justice and the 
purification of the world. The lambent flame, the red, fierce coal, 
suggest the conflagration of worlds in which the works of man and 



332 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

nature shall be alike consumed. It bears the imagination to those 
eternal fires which men call stars, that burn and shine in the blue 
ether like lamps around the throne of the Eternal. All science, all 
history, all poetry, are glowing in the nursery fire which keeps alive 
the memories of home. The " Dies Irse " is written in the burning 
coals, and so is the warmth and heat of that divine beneficence which 
can melt the heart of stone and unbind the icy fetters of worlds and 
men. 

It is in the open fire that the word " home " is written. Take 
away the warm, bright fire on the winter's day and the heart is 
chilled and all tender memories are banished. It is the live coal or 
the Yule log that makes the altar upon which unselfish sacrifices are 
offered and domestic affections are kept warm and glowing. The 
furniture may be scanty, the dwelling humble, but while the fire 
burns brightly on the hearthstone we feel at home. When the fire 
of home goes out we sink into ourselves and scarcely feel that we 
are members of a family, in the chill sense of desolation and penury. 
When husband, son, or father has been on some journey exposed to 
the rough, cold wind and storm, no word of welcome is so cheering 
as that which bids them come near the fire. The sense of warmth 
and comfort steals over the shivering limbs ; their faces glow in the 
kindly warmth and light ; smiles and words of cheer take the place 
of complaints about the weather. Then the wet boots are taken off, 
and the slippers that have been warming for them by the fire give 
rest and ease to the tired, cold feet. " This is bad weather to be 
out in. O how glad I am to get home!" is the traveller's ex- 
clamation; and, "O I'm so glad you're home!" that of each heart 
that cares for him. Then memories are quickened and tongues are 
loosened, and one after another around the fireside recalls some story 
of the past, when, on a night like this, a dear one was caught in a 
snow-storm and almost perished in the cold. One remembers the 
stormy night when the sailor of the family set out to join his ship, 
and another the midnight knocking at the door which awoke and 
frightened them, but which heralded the unexpected return of the 
absent one from some long voyage. Some rough experience of the 



HOME MEMORIES. 333 

days of war is told, when the pelting storm was more pitiless than 
the iron hail of the artillery. 

What stories, too, can grandma tell of the stately offers she re- 
ceived in the old days of propriety, when every lad in the village 
took off his cap and shuffled out of her way with due respect as she 
went to church. Like Madame Blaize, she can affirm that " the king 
himself has followed her when she has walked before;" that the 
village doctor had to take his own medicines when her rejection of 
him brought on a nervous cough, and that when one of Washington's 
regiments was quartered in the town the colonel, with many bows, 
asked the honor of dancing a minuet with her. 

Burn brightly, winter fire, and weave romances of the past as your 
smoke curls up the chimney of the happy home! No novelist can 
write such stories as those which your bright light recalls of child- 
hood's days and those of early man or womanhood, and plighted love 
and marriage bells, and the advent of the infant stranger, and the 
voices that made such tender music in our hearts, and the partings to 
meet again and the partings to meet hereafter in a home where tears 
and partings are no more. 

" Home, Sweet Home ! " Unbidden the simple melody, more sung 
with heart and voice through the wide world than any hymn of praise 
or national anthem, comes into the mind and flows from the fingers 
to the page : 

"'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam. 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home ! 
A charm from the sky seems to hallow us there, 
Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere! 

Home, home, sweet, sweet home ! 

There's no place like home ! 

There's no place like home ! 

" An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain 1 
O, give me my lowly thatched cottage again ! 
The birds singing gayly, that came at my call — 
Give me them ! — and the peace of mind, dearer than alU 

Home, home, sweet, sweet home ! 

There's no place like home! 

There's no place like home 1 " 



334 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Such are the lines as John Howard Payne wrote them, and as they 
were punctuated by himself. A glance in retrospect at his own wan- 
dering and changeful life gives them a stronger force and deeper 
meaning. The beautiful frontispiece to this volume shows us Payne's 
own fireside, but for many years of his eventful career he had no 
home. It is a sad comment on his world-famous song that scarce 
one of his biographers has recorded even the time and place of his 
birth correctly. All sorts of fables have been written about him and 
his poem. Some have said that he was starving in London when, on 
a bitter night beneath a street lamp, he wrote in anguish his plain- 
tive melody. But it was not so. He himself has left us the true 
story. The poem was written as an interlude in his " Clari, the 
Maid of Milan," an opera in three acts. In 1835, while at New 
Orleans, when questioned as to the music of the song, he told his 
friend, Mr. James Rees, of Philadelphia, that the air to which he 
had written the words was not wholly original with Henry R. Bishop, 
its composer, and director of the orchestra at Covent Garden Theatre, 
where "Clari" was first performed on Thursday, May 8, 1823. "1 
first heard the air," said Payne, " in Italy. One beautiful morning, 
as I was strolling alone amid some delightful scenery, my attention 
was arrested by the sweet voice of a peasant girl who was carrying 
a basket laden with flowers and vegetables. This plaintive air she 
trilled out with so much sweetness and simplicity that the melody 
at once caught my fancy. T accosted her, and after a few moments' 
conversation, I asked for the name of the song, which she could not 
give me, but having a slight knowledge of music myself, barely 
enough for the purpose, I requested her to repeat the air, which she 
did, while I dotted down the notes as best I could. It was this air 
that suggested the words of ' Home, Sweet Home,' both of which I 
sent to Bishop at the time I was preparing the opera of Clari ' for Mr. 
Kemble. Bishop happened to know the air perfectly well, and adapted 
the music to the words." The poem was written while Mr. Payne 
was staying in Paris, not in London. 

Upon Payne's monument in Tunis, where he was American con- 



HOME MEMORIES. 335 

sul, and where he died at six in the morning of the 9th of April, 
1852, it is stated that he died on April ist, and that he was born in 
Boston, Massachusetts. He was born in New York, and, in touch- 
ing terms, thus spoke at a banquet given him, December i, 1832, 
when he had just returned to America, viz. : " I beheld again the fair 
city of my birth enthroned upon her beautiful waters, and I rejoiced 
in belonging to such a mother, and that my weary pilgrimage had 
closed at such a home ! But this succession of emotions was but 
symbolical of deeper ones to which I yet was destined ; for, when 
my steps sought the spots to which in earlier life they were accus- 
tomed, I found a severer darkness (than the storm he had encoun- 
tered) frowning over them in the pestilence, and houses untenanted, 
or most of those which had inhabitants in tears and mourning. When 
I asked for many a friend of years gone by, I was pointed to the 
tomb. But presently the streets began to brighten into what they 
were ; many a warm hand renewed the earnest grasp so long ago 
remembered ; the welcome of many a departed parent smiled on me 
in their children : until at length I beheld the memories of a former 
day gathering the lovely and the gallant, and the intellectual, and 
the affluent, in one splendid circle, where I could almost fancy the 
spirits of some of the long-buried dead — who would have united at 
that moment with the living — hovering o'er a scene which made me 
forget the humbleness of my own desert in exultation for the glorious 
privilege of once again exclaiming, as I gazed before me : ' The wan- 
derer has a home, and it is here ! ' " 

From the age of thirteen, when his mother died, John Howard 
Payne was without a. settled home. He spent some early days at 
Boston, and some years at an humble cottage in East Hampton, Long 
Island, the regretful memory of whose attractions of sea and land 
and simple pastimes, without the later care and conflict, may have 
touched his thoughts when he wrote " Home, Sweet Home." 

These corrections seemed proper to the mention of his name, and 
the simple verses which touched millions of hearts and were printed 
and sold by the hundred thousand in a year. 



33^ THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Payne was an author — what would now be called a Bohemian — as 
well as an actor in his youth. Of all professions which a youth can 
choose for his career, those of literary work and the stage are the 
most precarious and the most homeless. The breath of popular 
applause is fickle as to both. Two stanzas, suggested by a Sicilian 
air and introduced into his opera, did what long years of labor failed 
to do : gave him " a name to live " while homes and languages exist 
on earth. His remains are to be brought to Washington, where a 
statue is to be erected to him, as has already been done in Brooklyn, 
Long Island, where it stands in Prospect Park. 

Many stories that have good authority, but yet want certainty, are 
told about the man in connection with the song. On one occasion, 
it is said by those who should be well informed, that he was about 
to sell his mule, but that the purchaser made him a present of it 
when he found he was the author of " Home, Sweet Home." On 
another occasion, when he was taken prisoner by the militia in 
Georgia, where he was occupying with his friend, John Ross, Chief 
of the Cherokees, a miserable hut, at midnight on their journey, 
Payne heard one of their captors singing his own " Sweet Home." 
Payne claimed the authorship, and sang it himself with such true 
feeling that the soldier swore he should never go to prison if he 
could help it, and on telling who his prisoner was at Milledgeville, 
he was released. The Bohemian's song to the Sicilian air is, indeed, 
like the magic " sesame " to open all doors and hearts. Its simple 
pathos, its suggestion of dearest, holiest memories of Home, which 
are beyond all words, has made it from pole to pole the song of 
songs. 




PETS IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 

" 'Tis sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark 

Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home." 

«HE ideal home has generally a pet in it, one of those 
" poor relations " that are not of the human species 
but resemble it in some instincts or qualities, such as 
affection and teachableness, so that to a greater or less 
degree, according to their intelligence, they become 
" one of the family." The dog and the horse become playmates and 
fellow-workers, and seem to understand by ticit sympathy the hon- 
orable and responsible position they hold in the family circle. They 
become the confidants and familiar friends of the kind master and 
mistress and their children, and the more gifted of them possess to 
a wonderful extent the art of mind-reading. Sometimes their family 
and ours have been long together and have kept pace through many 
changes in mutual service. The old mare dies, but the colt that kept 
so close to her in the meadow grows to the age of equine reason 
and physical strength and beauty, and our children gallop on its back 
as we did on its mother's. The characteristics of the dog are heredi- 
tary, like those of the horse. In pace, build and disposition old Char- 
ley's sons and daughters resemble.himself, and still more remarkably do 
dogs transmit their virtues, and, alas, their faults. The tracing of 
these family resemblances is a study of which the wisest philosopher 
need not be ashamed. There are dogs whose incorruptible fidelity 
and honesty, and what in human beings would be called strong' 
moral and religious principle, were conspicuous in their parents and 
won for them the affection and regard of those they lived with. Some 
dogs display strategic and ingenious talents — a slyness and artfulness 
22 (337) 



338 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

not always unamiable and often very useful to their human protectors 
and allies — which have puzzled those who maintain that there is a 
definite line between human reason and the cunning and instinct of 
the brute. There are thousands of instances on record in which 
neither cunning nor instinct completely expresses the dog's mind. 
He reasons sometimes on strictly logical principles, and is not so 
entirely a stranger as his slower human competitors in the arts of 
ratiocination deem him to the inductive philosophy. He more fre- 
quently than his human schoolmates suppresses the major premiss in 
his syllogisms, and prefers to reason from the particular to the uni- 
versal rather than, as man does, from the universal to the particular. 
He infers laws from phenomena, and looks for the accustomed dinner- 
bell with as much punctuality as if he carried a watch; The unerring 
instinct of dogs renders them of priceless value to lost wanderers, 
and a case illustrating this point is that of the unfortunate survivors 
of the wrecked "Jeannette." So long as Lieutenant DeLong and 
his party kept their dogs they had a chance of saving their lives 
through these faithful friends, but when the dogs were killed and 
eaten their last hope was gone. They had no means of finding their 
way to food through the power of scent, which the dogs possessed. 

But the analogy must not be pursued too far. Sometimes what 
is called instinct in a brute resembles rather a supernatural revelation 
than any consecutive process like reasoning. One summer's morn- 
ing it was decided in a family that out of seven little kittens one only 
should be kept. At the breakfast-table the awful question upon 
which the fate of the six innocents depended was discussed by the 
Christian and kind-hearted family. The paterfamilias said : " My 
dear, we cannot keep so many. Drowning is not torture — " but, " O 
papa, papa, you would not drown the pretty creatures : it would be 
so cruel ! " cried eagerly one after another of the domestic jury of 
little ones. The crest-fallen judge, astonished to find himself voted a 
monster of cruelty by his own brood, said : " Well, well, children, 
settle it among yourselves," and mamma was elected judge by them 
in place of the stern parent who thought drowning no torture. Now,

these kittens who were thus, unknown to themselves, being tried for 
their lives, had never yet meandered outside the garden gate. The 
extent of their geographical knowledge was the grass-plat, and of a 
world beyond the kitchen fire they had never speculated. Mamma 
decided that as this was the morning upon which a travelling wagon 
would call on its way to the next station ten miles off, the six little 
kittens should be tied together in a bag and carried some miles away 
when they should be turned loose, like little Ishmaels without a 
Hagar, feline Arabs to find a home in the desert, in an open plain. 
The driver did precisely as he was bidden. The kittens left " the 
warm precincts of the genial day," and, securely tied in a bag which 
was placed at the bottom of the wagon, were driven away into the 
wide, wide world. The driver duly reported the turning the kittens 
loose upon the common, some eight miles away. A week passed 
and the tears of sorrow had been wiped from the children's eyes and 
apprehension for the fate of the six homeless kittens had been effaced 
by newer incidents, when one of them, standing on the stoop that 
looked on the long garden at the back of the house, beheld a spec- 
tacle that made her scream with terror. Haggard, famished, with 
eyes of piteous appeal and awful suffering, coming almost in a line 
with "fainting steps and slow," a ghastly and spectral regiment, came 
up the avenue toward the child, not the six, but three out of the six 
kittens. The one that had been kept was purring and playing in 
a child-nurse's arms, its fur glossy, its eyes full of delighted miscliief, 
— what should it know, in the lap of luxury, of pain, exposure, star- 
vation and death ? — while the three of its brothers and sisters, who 
seemed to have returned from another world, were the most woe- 
begone of living skeletons. What had become of the other three ? 
Doubtless, they had fainted on the long journey and died forlornly. 
Better for them had it been if the jury of children had followed their 
papa's suggestion of the pail of water. But the voice of nature for- 
bade all further ostracism of the three poor wanderers, one of whom 
died within an hour in spite of warmth and milk. They were ad- 
mitted once more to the family circle, and their untold adventures 



340 THE HEARTHSTONE, OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

during their week of absence were the mysterious talk of the nursery 
on many a winter's evening. 

This anecdote, which I have told in tragic style, is simply true, and 
the question to be asked, not answered, is : By what mysterious intui- 
tion, since the way had never been seen or known by them, had these 
three kittens walked back eight miles from a country plain during 
that week of misery ? Experience could not have helped them, for 
they had been tied up in a bag at the bottom of the wagon, and taken 
a road they had never travelled before? Reason could no more have 
helped them than experience, if reason implies knowledge as a start- 
ing point. Induction and deduction alike fail to bring those kittens 
home. Instinct must have done it, that instinct which, as Antigone 
declared of natural love, is beyond all law; that instinct which brings 
back the carrier dove with messages on its wings and makes the 
bloodhound's nostrils a surer guide than all the deep-laid schemes 
of the detective in tracking the fugitive from justice. 

In the home circle, the cat and kitten are much esteemed, yet, like 
many noble families among ourselves, it is not easy to see any great 
intellectual, moral, or physical superiority in them. Catching mice 
is scarcely ground enough for placing the cat among the aristocracy 
of animals. They are sometimes affectionate and seem to take a 
kindly interest in the family, but their affection is not so disinterested 
as that of dogs. They are not forgiving. A dog's affection will sur- 
vive the harshest treatment, but a cat never forgets a punishment 
and rarely in its heart forgives it. One has only to witness a per- 
sonal encounter between cat and dog to be impressed with the 
superior cunning of the former and the greater courage of the latter. 
The cat's main purpose in her strategy seems to be to " scratch his 
eyes out," but the dog is content if he leave his war prints on her 
tail. Nothing magnanimous has been recorded in feline history : 
whereas the biography of dogs is full of heroism, self-sacrifice and 
philanthropy. We must seek further then than the heroic virtues to 
account for the privileges allowed to cats in the economy of home. 
Their fur is sometimes very glossy and beautiful and this pleases the 



PETS IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 34 1 

eye. Their purr is suggestive of repose beside a cosy fire and of 
the singing of the tea-kettle and of that social meal. The more 
reserved and quiet manners of the cat as compared with the dog 
have operated in her favor with the female mind. The cat has more 
of Jacob's, the supplanter's, nature ; the dog more of Esau's good- 
hearted impulsiveness. Hence she often gets his birthright by 
stratagem as well as her own, and the juicy bone which by divine 
right is Tray's is given to Tabitha. The dog is like Tom Jones, 
always getting into scrapes ; the cat is like Joseph Blifil, a purring 
hypocrite. 

This characterization, however, is general. There are dogs who 
are as deficient in honesty as cats, and there may be here and there 
a cat of almost canine fidelity. We should not judge others severely 
because they belong to a different race from ourselves. But the 
exuberant affection with which the domestic cat is regarded in some 
households has always astonished me. These remarks do not apply 
to kittens, for, before the development of cunning and hypocrisy in 
the feline disposition, the happy alternations of play and sleep, the 
innocent naivete of the kitten's movements, its evident enjoyment of 
the mere fact of existence and the innocency of its sportive conduct, 
are very endearing and commendable. 

Parrots are sometimes made great pets of, although a natural diffi- 
dence and aversion to having one's face or fingers bitten prevents 
most of us from cultivating too close an acquaintance with them. 
Their table-talk is amusing and occasionally instructive — sometimes, 
perhaps, a little too personal. The small canary bird, whose bright 
eye inspects the busy scene and whose solos are cheering in the 
morning sunshine, is a safer pet, and less given to mischievous vocal- 
ism than the parrot. 

All pets, whatever their kinds and degrees of beauty, talent and 
amiability, having been once adopted, have claims upon our protection 
and good will which few are mean and hard enough to repudiate. 
The raven, the mouse, the rabbit, the guinea-pig, and even the tame 
rat, when once admitted to intimacy, should never be forsaken so 



342 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

long as they justify the confidence we have reposed in them. The 
mutual affection existing between the wholesale keepers of such 
domestic live-stock and their dependents is a sight worth seeing. 
They know well the hand that feeds them from the hand reached out 
in simulated kindness to annoy and teaze them. But it is not advis- 
able for private families to keep a menagerie ; one or at most two pets 
in the household are enough. 

When the claims of all the varied species of such pets are fairly 
considered, there will appear no reason for displacing the dog from 
his supremacy as the only creature who will of his own free will leave 
his own kindred for the sake of man. For the credit of humanity 
it is pleasant to believe that man has not been wholly ungrateful to 
him, and that it is not only the poor Indian who can feel affection 
for the faithful companion of his fortunes. The dog never forsakes 
his master because of any change of worldly circumstances or a re- 
duced scale of living. In the homes, or too often the no-homes, of 
the very poor, the dog is one of the inseparable family and accom- 
panies them when they seek brighter fortunes in the far West. How- 
ever scanty may be the stock of food, the faithful creature has his 
necessary share. In many Southern States, as Virginia and North 
Carolina, one may often see two or three big dogs belonging to one 
poor family and counted as so many " hands " in the domestic pro- 
gramme. When the human family migrates the dogs go with it, 
and should accident or death befall a dog the family, especially the 
children, are filled with inconsolable grief The vacant kennel is 
sometimes as much an emblem of bereavement and sorrow as the 
vacant chair. 

But all the kindness we human beings have ever shown to dogs 
does not equal their benevolent services to us. Rightly have they 
been deemed worthy of the greatest friendship by the greatest minds. 
Sir Isaac Newton might not so calmly have forgiven the destruction 
of his manuscript had it been done by a careless human domestic. 
But the playful spaniel had small respect for the binomial theorem. 
Education, of which dogs, as the ancient Athenians well knew, are 



PETS IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 343 

peculiarly susceptible, soon teaches a dog of gentle breeding never 
' to lay paws or apply teeth to matter which he does not know to be 
valueless, — like a flunky's leg. And even if they sometimes err 
through inadvertence and injure furniture or books, these are foibles 
to be lost sight of in their grander virtues. When thieves are trying 
to break through and steal, who so vigilant as the faithful watch-dog? 
When sickness is in the household, who notes the doctor's visits and 
long face more anxiously than the silent, thoughtful, sorrowing dog ? 
When the kind voice of the master or mistress, or the little play- 
fellow of the nursery, calls to him so cheerily no more, who sickens 
and dies out of the truth and depth of his affection for us except the 
faithful dog ? Very touching is the not unfrequent sight of the dog 
refusing to be comforted and visiting — to return no more to the home 
now desolate to him — the new-made grave of his master. Often 
in their death they are not divided. 

And some of us may have witnessed the counterpart to this picture, 
that of a dog's funeral, in which a whole family have followed the be- 
loved one to his garden-grave with no mere hypocrisy of grief Many a 
strong man unused to weep or " play the woman " has shed tears of 
real grief at the death of his dog. I have always thought that meaner 
even than to shoot an enemy from behind a hedge is to poison his 
dog in order to afflict him with an irreparable loss. For the dog 
once loved and become " one of us " is not to be replaced. Others 
can be had in plenty, but dogs have a biography which is personal 
to each one of them when they are of high intelligence and nobility 
of character. Even strangers miss them and ask, "Why, where's 
your dog?" The Christmas guests miss the friendly bark that wel- 
comed them, for dogs are often the masters of the ceremonies and 
guardians of the hearth who seemed to call the names and bid us 
enter the hospitable doors as they 

" Wagged all their tails and seemed to say 
The master knows you — you're expected." 

Indeed, the humane and humanizing quality of a noble dog iV his

most homely and pleasant characteristic. He can often put us in 
good humor when we feel " out of sorts." He can inspire us with 
kindlier feehngs toward our fellow-men and women. He can plead 
as an eloquent but mute advocate for our truant boys when they have 
been out of bounds with him on what he knows as well as they was 
an illicit gambol. When he has not a perfect consciousness of his 
own rectitude he shows it, and if he has gained a dinner by unfair 
and sneaking artifice, he feels dyspepsia of the heart, his food does 
him no good, he laments his lapse from the straight path of virtue 
and keeps out of our sight, not so much because he dreads the rod 
as because he feels that our confidence in his integrity is broken. 

In the training or education of pets the same method should be fol- 
lowed which I have suggested in another chapter in the case of chil- 
dren. Far better than the rule of " Never too late to mend " is " Never 
too soon to begin." The lower animals, like ourselves, are the creatures 
of habit, and it is as true of the dog as of the child that if you train 
him up in the way that he should go, when he is old he will not de- 
part from it. The gravest defect in the education of household pets 
is that too much pains are taken in teaching them the fine arts, such 
as standing on their hind legs and holding skeins of silk for their 
mistress — they generally accompany a piano with vocal music of-their 
own accord — while too little attention is paid to moral and social 
philosophy. A conscientious perception of the rights of persons and 
the difference between " meum " and "tuum" is of more importance 
than mere accomplishments. The first point in a dog's education is. 
religious rather than secular : it is to keep the commandments and 
do as he would be done by. Greediness and selfishness are easily 
eradicated in the dog, for he is naturally the most generous and un- 
selfish of creatures. But care for number one is latent in him as in 
children, and if encouraged will vitiate and demoralize his whole 
character. Socratic temperance should be taught him in the use of 
meats. The canine gourmand is as unlovely as the human. He 
should not be encouraged to desire the chief seat at feasts, and the 
eleemosynary spirit toward poorer and less favored dogs should be

developed in his breast. Above all, let us remember that a sense of 
justice and a love of virtue are native to him, and that it is only the 
dog who has had evil surroundings and never enjoyed the blessings 
of a Christian home and a refined education who becomes a social 
pirate and the terror of his neighborhood. He is strongly imitative 
and soon learns mercy from the merciful, order from the orderly, 
manners from the mannerly, and tyranny from the tyrannical. " The 
merciful man regardeth the life of his beast," and the beast knows 
when he is well treated and has a merciful man for his master. If 
we are good to him, he will be good to us. 

CARE OF CANARY BIRDS, PARROTS, ETC. 

Canary Birds. — Almost all diseases to which canaries are sub- 
ject are occasioned by colds, which generally are contracted by 
their being placed in a draught or in a hot room. As a general 
rule, a bird cannot be given too much fresh air. Even in winter time, 
although it is never quite safe to hang the cage in the window, it is 
iidvisable to throw open the window once or twice a day to let in the 
air. Canaries are tender creatures; but they will stand a low tem- 
perature — as low as fifty degrees — providing you keep them out of 
draughts. A temperature not lower than sixty degrees is about right, 
and this should be maintained day and night, if possible. More birds 
sicken and die from diseases contracted by exposure to night chilli- 
ness than from any other known cause. Again, the air of a room 
should not be over-heated or suffused with gas. The philosophy of 
management of canaries may be summed up thus : Proper light, 
proper air, and proper food. A bird should never be removed sud- 
denly from a dark to a light room, or vice versa. All day it should 
be allowed the broad sunlight, but never exposed to the sun's direct 
rays. 

Unless colds are relieved promptly they often turn to asthma, and 
birds so diseased frequently sit for hours at a time with their feathers 
pufifed out, wheezing as though every breath gave them intense pain. 



34^ THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

This can be benefited by giving, in addition to their regular food, 
small particles of salt pork covered over thickly with cayenne pepper. 
A cracker soaked in water and sprinkled with cayenne pepper is 
equally good. When birds seem to have lost their voices, which 
they often do, the most effectual remedy is to place pure rock candy 
in their drinking water and let it dissolve. If birds are provided with 
nice clean sand or gravel, their perches kept scrupulously clean, and 
always supplied with fresh water, they will not suffer from sore feet. 

Cages should be scoured clean in hot water frequently in order to 
keep insects off birds. If, however, they are troubled with them, put 
the least bit of kerosene oil under each wing — say as much as re- 
mains on your little finger after you have let the drop fall. Do this 
every ten days until all are rempved. 

Every morning a canary should have a daily allowance of summer 
rape seed, canary seed and millet seed, in equal proportions — alto- 
gether a dessertspoonful per day. Most birds will eat more than 
this amount if it is allowed them. As early in the spring as pos- 
sible, they should have every day a small quantity of chickweed, 
lettuce or water-cress, well washed and fresh. In the winter a thin 
slice of sweet apple may be put in the cage daily. Once a week in 
winter half a wine-cracker may be put into the cage. 

During the moulting season, in July or August — months which 
are about as fatal to canary birds as to infants — the food should be 
carefully chosen and proportioned. The mixed seed should be put 
into the cage as usual ; and, once a week at least, a small quantity of 
raw beef, of the tenderest sort, scraped and moistened with cold water, 
should be put into the cage. Once a week hard-boiled yolk of egg 
and grated cracker should be mixed and put into the cage. Many 
authorities on the treatment of birds object to sponge-cake, lumps of 
sugar and hemp seed as unsuitable. The latter is thought to be too 
rich and fattening ever to give to a canary. A canary should never 
be left in a room alone constantly. It will droop and die. The best 
singers are those surrounded by the voices of children, the sound 
of a piano or the hum of a sewing-machine occasionallv. Birds, 



PETS IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 347 

like human beings, want companionship, and particularly these little 
pets. And what is true of canaries in this respect is true of all 
birds kept in the house. The best canaries are the German, known 
as Andreasberg, a species raised in the Hartz Mountains. They are 
the longest lived and most docile. 

Teaching a canary bird to whistle or warble a tune requires patience 
and persistence, as do most things that are worth the doing. It 
should be placed in as small a cage as possible ; cover the top and 
three sides of same so that it cannot see you or anything about the 
room to attract its attention ; then set the cage in front of a looking- 
glass (open side to glass) so that he can see himself, imagining it to 
be another bird. This done, commence as you wish, either to whistle 
or play on some musical instrument. Four or five lessons will be 
sufficient if the bird proves an apt scholar. 

Parrots. — The larger species of parrots are known as maccaws 
and cockatoos. The smaller species are the parroquets. The gray 
parrot is a native of Africa. These, of all parrots, make the best 
talkers, are the aptest scholars, and possess the most retentive mem- 
ory. The gray parrot will learn to talk, whistle, sing, cry, laugh, 
mew like a cat, bark like a dog, bray like a donkey, and crow like a 
game-cock. They will learn until about their tenth year, and have 
been known to live in a cage for nearly a century. In selecting one 
you wish to educate yourself, never take one that is wild. He should 
be tame enough so that when you approach him he will in no way 
act shy or frightened. A wild parrot can rarely be tamed ; conse- 
quently, he-can rarely be taught. 

The most common food given to parrots is hempseed, corn and 
crackers, of which they are extremely fond. Some parrots are brought 
up on black coffee instead of water, while others never drink, but 
simply eat bread or cracker soaked in water, the moisture of which 
is sufficient to satisfy their thirst. Canary seed is the chief food for 
parroquets, though some will eat hempseed and unhulled rice (Paddy) 
in addition to canary seed. 

Mocking-birds. — In purchasing a mocking-bird a nestling is pre 



348 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

ferable to one trapped, from the fact of its being the tamest of the 
two. It feels also more contented in its cage, and soon becomes very 
docile and greatly attached to mankind. The prepared food sold by 
bird dealers is the best, and, by way of a change, a small quantity 
of ants' eggs soaked in water. About one meal-worm a day will 
greatly promote the song of a bird. Grasshoppers and spiders should 
only be given to such birds as the mocker, thrush, starling or black- 
bird, or to birds of that size. Small birds not being able always to 
digest them, they are apt to bring on disease. Fine gravel mixed with 
beach sand for the bottom of the cage is preferable to gravel alone. 
All soft-billed birds require spacious cages, as they are generally 
more active and swifter than seed-eatin" birds. 




THE MOTHER IN THE HOME. 

" I know thou art gone where thy forehead is starred 
With the beauty that dwelt in thy soul, 
Where the light of thy loveliness cannot be marred, 
Nor thy spirit flung back from its goal." 

SHE bravest woman I ever knew, and by brave I mean 
that steady courage that could not be stampeded — 
that led its possessor to make the long pull and the 
steady pull and to be as unflinching at the last as at 
the first of a trial — was the mother of several children 
and the wife of a man too unlike her to know her character any better 
at the end of her life than he did when he married her. 

She was a type of woman rare it is true, but not so rare that the 
generality of my readers will not find in her portrait a likeness to 
some friend or acquaintance. At the time of which I write her hus- 
band had been unfortunate, and the family had been compelled to 
remove from the city where they had lived to a small farm they 
owned several miles away. Not one of the children but felt they 
would be exiled from all the delights of life, and so expressed them- 
selves. The mother met the change quietly, saying it would benefit 
the children to be in the country for a while, and that she saw good in 
what was considered an evil. And, indeed, she saw good in every- 
thing ; it was one of her characteristics. She pictured the beauties 
of hillside and of dale, and recounted the pleasures she had known as 
a child in the country. To the sons she talked of the fishing, the 
horses and the dogs they would have, and to the daughters she 
promised flowers, picnics and the companionship of their friends 
when the place was all fixed up. " Fixing-up " was a work that no 

(349) 



3SO THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

one understood so well as herself would require a great deal of hard 
labor with small means. But she won by her sweet persuasiveness 
the hearty interest of all the children, even to the eldest daughter, 
the least willing of all to go to the country, because she was just 
approaching the age when girls like to be with companions of their 
own age and to go where they are most apt to meet the brothers of 
their friends. A long talk with her quite alone one morning settled 
outward opposition from that quarter, and she kept the promise 
then made so well that the others called her " mother's champion." 
The tact and sweetness of the mother had won the victory, and the 
new home was occupied by as rebellious yet outwardly calm children 
as ever felt resentment toward fate or paid homage to a mother's 
beautiful love. Somehow they felt that their father had not dealt 
fairly with their mother, and that he was the author and source of all 
their troubles. This feeling helped them to hold fast to themselves 
when they faced the actual realities of their changed condition and 
saw how ordinary, compared to what they had known, was the place 
they were to call their home. It seemed to them that it would have 
been unbearable but for " mother," and it would have been had she 
failed them ; but she was so bright a presence in the house, so pleasant 
and agreeable to her sons and daughters, that, young though they were, 
they felt that in her they had more than other people had who never 
had misfortune, and who owned the best of everything. She smiled 
upon their serious faces, and they felt constrained to go up to her and 
embrace her, or to lean against her and have their hair stroked by her 
magnetic hands. She knew the way to each of their hearts, and kept 
watch over their faults as Cerberus did the way to the infernal regions. 
They in their turn knew her every expression, and if she looked pale 
or seemed weary there was a protest at once against her going out 
into the sunshine or doing any more work that day. This spirit she 
indulged in her children, and when she saw that they wanted her to 
be controlled by them she would yield, taking the opportunity to 
talk with them familiarly about their plans and the work they were 
to help her to do when she got strong again. If it rained she

THE MOTHER IN THE HOME. 351 

would show her fine management by pleading weariness and dividing 
her duties between her children. The eldest brother and sister were 
given the dining-room to make look " better than it ever did before," 
and the two younger boys and their little sisters were put at light 
tasks in her presence, which they performed all too fast for the 
mother, who had to tax her resources to devise further employment 
for them. When actual duties were exhausted, she would gather 
them about her and ask their advice about improvements she desired 
to make. Such counsel as she got, though it was diametrically 
opposite often and again, she would accept with a thoughtful look 
and a quiet assent that made her young advisers feel thoroughly 
comfortable all day, believing that they had helped her out of a 
dilemma. 

They were not interested in their new home or truly content until, 
in one of these family meetings, she told them the farm was her own, 
and that her father had given it to her long ago, after her only 
brother, who was to have had it, died just as he left college. That if 
she could make it more attractive and valuable, by-and-by they could 
rent it for enough to pay for a home in town, and with their help she 
thought she could make it so. Then six eager, expectant faces 
were about her, and six tongues were talking at once. She heard 
all they had to say, and wisely diverted them when their enthusiasm 
was expended and they verged on sadness or repining. Their father 
went into the .city every day and they saw little of him. That was 
no privation to them, because they had their mother all to them- 
selves all the day long. 

Beautiful days those were to that band of children, and the world 
was in after years all the brighter to them for the experiences they knew 
then. The true beauty and unselfishness of that mother's character 
was not understood wholly at the time, but it was afterward, and it 
strengthened them for the changes that came in after years to each 
and all. 

The house was surrounded by what had been a pretty paling fence, 
but it had been neglected until it needed careful repairing from one 



352 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

end to the other. This was one of the first pieces of work the mother 
desired to do, but she had not decided how to go about it, until the 
daughter complained of its appearance. Then there was a visit 
made to it, and every paling was examined. The son was carelessly 
told to bring the hammer and nails along, and by dint of encourage- 
ment and coaxing, the loose boards were fastened as far as there was 
time that day and the whole subject of the fence was discussed earn- 
estly. It was decided that the nailing could all be done by the oldest 
boy, and that the hired man should be called upon to get substitutes 
for the missing palings. When the fence, that had appeared as if it 
was getting tired and seemed only not to fall, in places, had been 
straightened and made whole (and it required a great deal of labor 
to make it so, and mother had often gone out to where her boy was 
working with flushed face and aching hands, sustained only by the 
thought that he was improving her place, with the lemonade and 
cake she had thoughtfully put aside for him) it was a day of rejoicing. 

Very wisely this sagacious woman had interested her daughters in 
flowers, and the eldest was not slow to see that plenty of blossoms in 
that large bare yard would make it a different place. So there were 
trips made to the woods, and vines and wild plants were transplanted, 
and the few rose bushes on the place were trimmed and the earth 
about them enriched. No work was kept up until the children were 
tired, and no undertaking was pursued until they became restless. 
The fence was painted twice over though there was but one brush 
to go over fully a mile, when both sides were completed, and the ruses 
of the sister and brother to get off to do this work, when mother 
was helping the one maid-of-all-work, commanded her respect. 
They showed themselves such apt scholars in the art of unselfish 
dissimulation that she was proud of them and let them work until 
they had done enough. Then the delighted surprise of mother 
when she went out to lend a helping hand, and found how much was 
accomplished, was sufficient stimulant for several days to come. 

When this task was accomplished and pronounced by both father 
and mother a perfect success, the children were aroused to a sense 



THE MOTHER IN THE HOME. 353' 

of pride in the place, and the adornment of the lawn was made their 
one thought. They searched the woods for wild roses and brought 
from the fields every plant that gave promise of pretty blossoms. 
Seeds were bought and carefully planted, and when the spring was 
fairly upon them the promise of a pretty yard was soon fulfilled. 
Dead limbs had been cut, the whitewash brush had been used on 
the trunks of the trees, and the ground was as clean " as a velvet 
carpet,'' to quote one of the industrious brood. Honeysuckles that 
had gone to waste over the ground were fastened to supports, and 
the shrubbery pruned until it all looked good as new. Walks were 
straightened, borders made, and the garden was reclaimed. To do 
all this required a great deal of toil, and no end of utility, ingenuity 
and good management. The mother had all these qualities, and 
when she taught her children how to cover unsightly stumps with 
graceful vines and showy plants, and where to put out shrubs that 
they had secured after long effort, she was inspired in her lessons by 
the assurance of her conscience that she was helping them to over- 
come obstacles and meet misfortune with quiet courage. 

The spirit of improvement once thoroughly aroused there was no 
suppressing the plans formed to "get the place in order." It became 
a by-word in the family, and the two eldest were accused of talking at 
night in their sleep and planning the most unheard-of things, all for 
the purpose of getting things to rights. The time came when the 
house was in thorough order, and only required to be painted out- 
side to have it " a beauty," and the yard was ready for the warm 
days that would bring up the flowers from the ground and cause 
the young trees and shrubs to grow. There had been much quiet 
talk about what should be done with the ugly old fence around the 
barn. It must remain because a new one was an expense not to be 
thought of, and it could not be improved by novices. This the chil- 
dren thought, and so said father when he heard the matter discussed 
by them. Mother listened quietly until he had finished his remarks 
and then discreetly broke up the consulting party and waited for a 
more convenient season to think and act. 
23 



354 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Not many days after that the father was surprised to see, instead 
of the dingy old fence, a perfectly white one gleaming in the sun- 
shine and making the whole place look cleaner. It had been white- 
washed, and in each corner had been planted, far enough back to keep 
the cattle from destroying them, hollyhocks, sunflowers and dahlias 
alternately. The feat was performed under great difficulties, be- 
cause a rail fence is not an easy article to treat to a coat of white- 
wash, and these workers were only amateurs. But they had discov- 
ered that white fences added immensely to the effect of the place, 
and they proposed to whiten everything they possibly could. Un- 
sightly stones were gathered together in one heap, and left until enough 
could be secured to make a rockery. Mother knew exactly how to 
make a rockery, and the eagerness with which even the youngest of 
the children gathered stones, and the hard struggles the older chil- 
dren had with the large rocks, was a pleasant recompense to the 
mother. The rockery was made, the vines were tangled over it, 
and in the shaded situation in which it had been placed the water- 
plants flourished ; and it was the chief ornament of the yard before the 
summer was ended. Of course trees do not grow in a day, nor 
flowers in a week, but long before the Strawberries were ripe in the 
garden, the improvements made had astonished friends and neighbors 
who had watched the work going on, never dreaming it was. being 
accomplished by a mother and her children. 

It was amusing to see the interest these young people came to 
. take in a place they had dreaded to see, and how indifferent they were 
to holidays so long as the improvements were going on. 

A view of the homely interior of the poultry yard was seen from 
the dining-room window, and this eye-sore had been the theme at 
many a rainy day chat. Finally it was agreed to ask father to con- 
sult with them, and hear how he would screen the view. Mother 
had a plan all her own which she had not broached to them, knowing 
they were unequal to the task, and she it was who suggested that 
their father might like to help them. When he heard of the project 
he seemed not surprised, and when their mother gave them her 



THE MOTHER IN THE HOME. 355 

idea, which was to plant two rows of young maples half around the 
yard, with a summer-house formed of two rows of trees closely 
planted at the lower side of it, they surmised that she had pre- 
viously prepared him, as she had done, for the plan she offered. 
This would make a delightful walk, she said, and seats could be 
arranged in the summer-house, which should be quite around the 
corner, so that it would not be seen until one was almost in it, 
and be a great ornament to the place. The idea was a splendid 
one, and the father could not set up any opposition to the plan. 
Who to get to dig the trees, and do the laying out and planting was 
the next question. The wife quietly eyed her husband and said that 
she should vote that he either stayed at home and do the work or hire 
a man in his stead. He laughed at the ideas, but was prevailed upon 
by his impulsive children to promise to look into the matter and do 
one or the other. The point was carried, and the walk was made by 
him and the hired man. Only young saplings were planted, and 
these were not expected to grow up in a season, but the work was 
done, and the children thought it the finest improvement yet made. 
It proved in a few years to be the most notable feature on the place, 
which was acknowledged to be the handsomest in the neighborhood. 
The children worked so much on it that they learned to love it, and 
they acquired more practical knowledge in the year that they 
devoted themselves to its beautifying, than they would have gained 
in a theoretical study of rural life in thrice that time. When the new 
school term began, and they returned to their books, it was with the 
comfortable feeling that they had the prettiest home in all the coun- 
try round about, and were all the more proud of its fame, because 
they had helped to make it attractive. They were proud as well of 
the fact that their mother was making the place self-supporting by the 
admirable way in which she managed the farm. It became in the 
course of a few years renowned for its fruit and marketable stuff) and 
the sale of its surplus crops gave to the mother what she had craved 
as only a mother can — pecuniary independence for the sake of her 
children. It was not the life she preferred, nor the one she was best 



3S6 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

fitted for or entitled to, by right of her talents; but it was the best 
under the circumstances, and the feeling that she had been able to 
lead it was a gratifying one. 

That mother was the ideal one, because she was great-hearted, gifted, 
and above all things she was wise. She was a woman whose native 
qualities of mind and heart, whose rectitude and bravery would have 
fitted her to adorn the highest stations in life ; but it was her lot to be 
an unpretending wife and mother ; to live a retired domestic career, 
finding no great reward in doing her daily duty, but doing it well 
nevertheless. In all her life she was not compensated for the effort 
she had made, the sufferings inflicted by others that she had endured 
so patiently. But she respected herself, and was true to the highest 
impulses of her being. So beautiful a character could not live in 
vain, did not. Her influence was far reaching and powerful. 

Those who came under it were the better ever afterward. Her 
husband's nature was transformed under it, and her children, inheriting 
much of his indifference and irascibility of temper, were moulded into 
better beings than they could have been under any less noble hand 
than guided them. They grew to be men and women, and, separated 
widely by circumstance, were nevertheless forever bound together by 
the memory of her love. To have been her child was a gracious 
boon deeply appreciated in after years, when her true superiority was 
fully understood through acquaintance with the world. 

Taught and trained by so good and intelligent a woman, how easy 
to face and conquer temptation and sin, and to travel along the dusty 
highway of life, soiled perhaps for the time being by the dust or mire 
met with, but not stained ineffaceably. 

Such was the mother whose image is ever present to many when 
the word Home is named. Like a benediction, women like this 
one grace homes and make them altars about which twine the heart- 
strings of their children ; make them temples filled with the sweet 
perfume of love, innocence and peace; and the heritage of such a 
home is the rarest blessing a man or woman ever possesses, or 
can ever imagine on earth. 




DUTY OF P/I|Er(TS TO CHILDPH. 

" To thine own self be trae, and it shall follow as the liight the day thou canst not the* 

be false to any man." 

^O the fifth commandment, it has always seemed to me, 
there should have been a codicil, reading: "Parents, 
be just to your children in the least as in the greatest 
thing." Were those who are parents rightly fitted for 
their duty, it would be needless to present the claim* 
of children, but in a country where parentage is assumed with an in- 
difference that can only be the result of ignorance, no subject requires 
so much consideration as this. 

Children oftentimes spend their early years in the endurance of 
wrongs that increase as they grow older, and which intensify their 
feelings against life, and their future in it. The reason that there is 
so much hope among children is because there is so little present 
satisfaction. They are martyrs to a greater variety of disappointed 
hopes than any class of the community, and their sufferings are as 
real to them as are the troubles of older people, and are as often of 
as much consequence. 

I never saw a child put off with unjust threats and told only half 
truths, if not absolute falsehoods, for the trivial reason, perhaps, that its 
parents might be rid of its presence, that I did not say in my inmost soul, 
"I wonder that men and women are as decent as they are, considering 
their bringing up." Fathers and mothers tyrannize over their children 
in ways they scarcely realize, because they are absolute rulers. There 
is no appeal from their judgments, and the child is compelled to abide 
by decisions that may be absolutely unjust. The cruelty of injustice 
is not its present suffering, but the sting it leaves behind, the scar that 

(357) 



358 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

certainly time does not efface, and perhaps not even eternity. There is 
no feehng so absolutely perennial, so wholly unforgetable as that of 
injustice from a father or mother. The wrongs of others may be 
forgiven and forgotten, but the memory of a wrong received at the 
hands of parents is not wiped out in any child's breast until old age 
dulls memory and oblivion sets recollection free. 

The manifold sins that injustice begets in the .young should be 
earnestly considered by parents. First of all is deceit, for a child 
quickly resorts to it, and relies upon it if a defence against its supe- 
riors is required. The shame of telling a falsehood is less keenly felt, 
because the truth would not make the same impression, and so the 
little being who should be jealously guarded is thrown off and put 
on the defensive, and the spirit of evil is fostered where the chastity 
of truth should be inculcated. 

Who has not seen an enraged father shake a helpless infant because 
it cried, and a nervous mother strike her child because its restless- 
ness irritated her? The poor little squirming victim could only realize 
its added pain, and perhaps know from whence it came, but it could 
not possibly understand the association between its cries and its 
parents' ill temper. As time passed and its mind expanded, it did, 
however, and with the knowledge there came added pain. 

The child-life of the Saviour has never been written, and there is 
but little said of it in the New Testament. It has often occurred to 
me that the fact was due to the inability of any man to rightly fathom 
it. What a theme it would have been under . his mother's hand ! 
But in those days, as in these, though to a lesser degree now than 
then, the rights of children were ignored, and the earthly father of 
Jesus as little knew his character as he anticipated his future career. 
The story of his childhood if told would doubtless be a revelation 
of parental gentleness and justice, of right dealing and high .spiritual 
and moral teachings from his mother certainly, and most likely from 
his father. 

He inspired and taught the commandment, " Honor thy father and 
thy mother," and we have attained to that position where the man or 



DUTY OF PARENTS TO CHILDREN. 3S9 

woman who neglects his parents in their old age, or under reverses 
of fortune, is held in contempt ; but we have not ascended to that 
plane where love and filial reverence are invariably the motives that 
actuate such recognition of this commandment. The average man 
or woman will treat with kindness the old father or mother who has 
Survived his or her days of usefulness, but it by no means follows that 
they are honored. On this, as on many another subject, we indulge 
in endless cant, but the truth remains that children do not love their 
parents simply by reason of relationship any more than they respect 
old age because it is merely old age. 

Men and women are foolish to expect more of a harvest than they 
have sown. Ingratitude is ranked as a deadly sin, and is one of the 
most repellent of human attributes; but has it not often been true 
that children have been unjustly accused of possessing it? The self 
ishness of parents is as obnoxious a vice, but it is far more leniently 
dealt with by the world. 

The exceptional maltreatment of parents by children is much 
commented upon, and loudly condemned ; but who among us sees 
blasphemy in the way a coarse father addresses his child, or thinks it 
an insult that children receive, when they are repelled heedlessly C 
We have one law for age and another for youth, and it is cruel. The 
child who is deceived will be deceitful; the child who is swindled 
will be tempted to steal ; the child who is defrauded of his birthright 
will not forgive the wrong in all human life. 

The saddest of earthly retrospects is that of an unworthy parent. 
What can equal the misery of a human soul awakened to a knowl- 
edge of the lasting injury done another soul that owes to it its earthly 
existence? Surely the judgment day is forever with such, and time 
offers no opportunity for reparation. 

We know so little about the laws of procreation, and are so in- 
different to such knowledge, that little children have a hard time from 
their earliest existence until they are grown. With many almost all 
childhood is a time hurriedly passed by, and as quickly ignored as 
possible, because it represents dependence- e^bjectjon, and chafing 



360 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

restraints. How often is this season wholly neglected ! how rarely 
fully perfected ! Who is to blame ? Certainly not children. Who 
then ? The fathers and mothers, whose ignorance or indifference, or 
both, blind them to their own responsibility, and whose selfishness 
torments children until they escape from it. 

Perhaps if men and women were better fitted to be parents, the 
terrible miseries inflicted upon their offspring would be averted. It 
is a knowledge for which the world stands more in need to-day than 
of any other. It is a knowledge that those who possess it ought to 
teach with earnestness, in all seasons and places. 

It will not avail that fathens regret the unfortunate heritage of their 
sons, and that mothers shed rivers of tears over the waywardness of 
their daughters. It is not enough that they wish they had never 
given birth to such children. It is their business to anticipate the 
characters of their children, and to give life only under such circum- 
stances as will with certainty make it a blessing and nothing 
else. Prudes and tyrants shut their eyes to this subject, and apply 
the epithet of coarseness to those who urge its consideration, but this 
does not avail. The child who is outraged in its conception will bring 
its Nemesis with it, and there will be no escape from it. " The sins 
of the parents are visited upon the children,'' and most frequently the 
retaliation of children upon parents is in proportion to the brand that 
is put upon them. If parents could always foresee the natures of their 
children, as it is their high privilege to do, and not only foresee them, 
but mould them nobly or otherwise, with absolute certainty, the evil 
results of irresponsible parentage would be at an end forever, and this 
Biblical saying would cease to have the terrible meaning to us that 
it now possesses. 

When will we become reasoning beings and increase the glory of 
God by elevating the standard of man? When the tyranny and 
oppression of the weak over the strong is lessened, then children will 
not come into the world with hatred and revenge deeply instilled in 
their beings. Then will not fathers be humbled to the dust in after 
years by the misdeeds of their children, whom they have begotten in 



DUTY OF PARENTS TO CHILDREN. 361 

iterance, and then expect them to be possessed of reason and 
righteousness. Until they are thus fairly treated \Yill the family life be 
wanting in beauty, in harmony and in true happiness, and the world 
be full of distress and discord. 

The right to a good organization, to a happy temperament, should 
not be denied a child, but should be earnestly striven for by parents — 
not mothers only, but fathers and mothers. And when children are 
born into homes they should be made welcome and treated with 
justice as well as affection ; with respect rather than indulgence. 

The world is working in the direction of justice to children, but as 
yet only the elementary steps have been taken. Only the rankest 
brutality is punished ; the most glaring inhumanity repressed. Many 
forms of injustice to children cannot be reached by organizations of 
a philanthropic kind ; the education of men and women in the direc- 
tion of marriage and parentage is the preliminary work. Societies 
may ameliorate the condition of the child of a drunken brute by tak- 
ing it from his control, but they cannot reach the incompetent and 
selfish father who fills the sacred office of parent unworthily. The 
births of unhealthy,' disorganized children cannot be prevented by 
law; moral elevation alone will make men and women refuse to assume 
the responsibilities of parentage until they can rightly train and 
develop their offspring. People marry too young, as a rule, and 
women are mothers frequently before their own girlhood is over. 
This is not as it should be, and until the evil of heedless marriages 
is corrected the characters and health of children will not improve. 

The pathetic picture of young mothers, scarcely more than girls 
themselves, bearing the burdens of motherhood, hampered by ignor- 
ance and poor health, is one all too familiar. The sight is one pitiable 
and discouraging. Life is saddened to the wise by the repetition 
of such examples, and the enthusiasts who in the quiet of their own 
studies see the dawn of the day when a healthier and nobler race 
of men will come upon the scene of action, put aside their bright 
hopes when they look upon such mothers as these, engaged in the 
rearing and training of the young. As a matter of fact, the children 



362 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

of such mothers get no training and very little of the right kind of 
care. They are dragged through the different stages of their growth 
and arrive at the age of ten or twelve years without having had other 
attention than pertained to their bodies, and that inadequately. The 
middle class in the United States comprehends a large society. In 
it are some of the best people the nation has produced, and again 
very many who are the natural products of ill-advised marriages. 
These are the ordinary common-place, and, generally speaking, the 
morbid and unhealthy men and women who see no beauty in life, 
and whose minds are wholly shut to the higher truths of philosophy. 
Their children are not improvements upon themselves, and the world 
is hardly benefited by their existence. 

The home that is without children is lonely and wanting in the love 
element, but such a home is preferable to those in which is apparent 
the injustice of parents to the children they have brought into the 
world under discordant or ignorant circumstances, and who are maimed 
before the battle in which they are to enter upon is begun. 

The injustice done children by the selfishness of fathers who smoke 
cigars or pipes, for instance, is one that injures the health of children 
permanently. Yet men scarcely permit this habit to be criticised, 
but the nervous wives and mothers of this land are its victims, and 
every honest physician admits this truth. Every child is entitled to 
nature's first food, pure air ; yet this most essential of all rights is often 
denied them. Every child is entitled to a clean body, and yet how 
few of the children in the world to-day are kept neat and clean any 
portion of the time ! Every child born into this world is entitled to 
decent rearing. Only cowards and moral delinquents shirk so grave 
a subject. The heathen nations cared for, and do now care for, their 
young more reasonably than do the people of Christian countries. As 
a rule, men, even those of the most extensive culture, are wholly un- 
educated on the physiological questions relating to parentage. They 
are the authors of the existence of children utterly unfit to live often- 
times. One of the most celebrated divines of his denomination in 
the United States has an idiot child, and has been heard repeatedly 



DutV of parei^ts to children. 363 

to allude to it as proof of God's love to him, since "God loveth whom 
he chasteneth." Strange to say, no one has ever rebuked him pub- 
licly for such blasphemy. A man who knows no more than he of 
the laws governing procreation should be driven from his post of 
public teacher. He is making God responsible for his own errors, 
and then strengthening his position with Scriptural quotations. 

Children who grow up to adult years only to turn and rend the 
hearts of their parents are unanimously condemned, yet the real cause 
of their course may be found to be due to conditions under which 
they were conceived and brought into the world. If children are un- 
welcome arrivals in their parents' house, if the expense of their main- 
tenance is a cross, and their presence a drawback to the comfort and 
well-being of others there, is it not to be anticipated that they will 
have inbred in the fibres of their being the murder, revenge, hatred 
and contempt which, while lying dormant for years, may break out 
at an unexpected moment? It is a well-nigh hopeless task to plead 
for justice to children while motherhood is treated in the unholy 
manner it is. The question of justice to children comprehends justice 
to mothers, and until the latter is secured, the first need not be an- 
ticipated ; it is out of the question. There is much said about women 
having the training and moulding of children in their own hands. It 
is not the truth so long as they have not yet as individuals nor as a 
sex learned the first and inalienable right of maternity. 

Truly, the inhumanity of man to man makes countless thousands 
mourn. One of the most unhappy and discordant men who ever 
lived, and who devoted the larger part of his time to writing unchari- 
tably of women and reviling their claims for larger liberty, was the 
son of an insane mother. He imbibed his father's contempt and scorn 
for the mother who, unconscious of her surroundings, gave birth to 
children. His memoir is to be found in all libraries, and yet there 
is no word of condemnation for that father who was simply not more, 
not less, than a brute. Had his son become an Ishmaelite instead of 
a misanthrope the fact should not have occasioned surprise. 

The crime of infanticide is denounced as inhuman in mothers, yet 



364 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

fathers are equally responsible for it. Women are driven to it in 
many cases through fear of bitter suffering. Children are begotten 
not unfrequently when there is grim want to be faced, and the dread 
of burdens too heavy to bear leads to this awful crime. 

Justice to children demands that life should not be given where 
there is not the means to support it ; and a time will come when 
governments will deal directly with the question of parentage, but it 
will not be in this age. We are rioting in what we call liberty, but 
what is really license. There is nothing men so quickly resent as 
admonition regarding a too numerous progeny, or of becoming the 
fathers of imbeciles and idiots or depraved offspring. Time will be 
when the nation will hold itself directly responsible for such a popu- 
lation as fills our charitable institutions. The State will directly con- 
cern itself about the children of irresponsible and unworthy parents, 
and then, and not till then, will the injustice now visited upon helpless 
innorents be at an end. 




DEATH IN THE HOME. 

" The living are the only dead ; 

The dead live, — nevermore to die; 
And often, when we mourn- them fled, 
They never were so nigh! " 

EREMY TAYLOR, "the Shakespeare of divines," has 
said that human beings probably suffer as much in the 
process of being born as in that of dying. It may 
"^ well be so, for death itself is seldom painful, and even 
the most painful illnesses, when they terminate fatally, 
are generally marked by a cessation of pain some time before the 
close. Death is generally a tranquil falling asleep, and if it were not 
for the materialism of the human mind, which regards the stopping 
of the physical machinery as the extinction of the spiritual principle, 
it would be very difficult to account for the superstitions with which 
death has in all ages been associated. To a higher philosophy and 
a more spiritual insight death is really not so much to be lamented 
as pain, yet parents and relatives would rather see a sufferer linger 
than sink into the placid sleep of death. There is surely some selfish- 
ness in this, although its cause is the natural affection which hangs 
upon the well-known voice and lives in the sunshine of the loved 
one's face. Yet it is certainly paradoxical, if not unaccountable, that 
the old heathens should have had the fortitude to bear the parting 
better than Christians who have a stronger hope than they of being 
reunited in another world. 

How gloomy is the home which death has entered ! The only 
calm face is often that of the dead wife or husband, parent or child. 
People speak to one another in a constrained and unnatural whisper, 

(36s) 



366 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

as though afraid of disturbing a repose which can never more be 
broken by disturbance. Then there is the shutting out of the sun- 
Hght, the Hghting of candles in the dark chambers, the stealthy tread 
of the undertaker, and in some countries of the mutes who are to 
put on the paid hypocrisy of grief Nothing can well be imagined 
more utterly desolate and gloomy than the time-honored Christian 
funeral. 

In former times, at funerals in England, the widow, daughters, wife, 
sisters and other near relatives of the dead, sat in awful silence, clothed 
in black, except the white cap or cravat, and with two mutes at the 
door of the house. Then the hearse bearing the corpse, and the car- 
riages, or mourning coaches, as they were called, carrying the clergy- 
men and male relatives and mourners only, wended their melancholy 
way to the church-yard, where, after a brief, solemn service, the funeral 
was over and the solemn guests departed. For the conventional 
twelvemonth the family abstained from all the social gayeties of life, 
and even from its most innocent pleasures, and went about to church 
or business clothed in the deepest mourning! There has lately been 
a relaxation of these rigid ceremonies, but it is still the case that 
first, last and all the time everything that is connected symbolically 
with death is gloomy and depressing. 

Yet what does religion, and especially a religion so sublime as 
Christianity, amount to if it cannot shed the light of hope and resig- 
nation upon the inevitable lot of all ! It is hard to lose the child 
upon whom a mother's love has been so lavishly expended, and the 
wrench to nature is indeed a terrible one. But if the mother really 
has faith that death is but the gateway of a happier life, in which 
pain and sickness and disappointment cannot enter, she ought surely 
not to be sorry for her little one as though some dreadful evil had 
befallen it. So also of the husband or wife, the father or mother. 
Death is no unusual accident or catastrophe, but the common lot. A 
few years more is all that could have been added to the life that stops. 
If the joys of this brief existence are laid down, so also are its sor- 
rows, and surely the latter are quite as real as the former. We need 



DEATH IN THE HOME. 367 

not say with Lord Byron that whatever life has been to any one " 'tis 
something better not to be," but we may surely feel, as many of the 
great and good, even before gospel times, have felt, that if death be 
not a good, it is certainly not an evil. 

Very comforting, within rational limits, is the belief that the dead 
are only separated from us for a brief interval, by a thin veil, through 
which we may, in happy moments, catch glimpses of them, and in 
hours of gloom and solitude feel their cheering presence. Some per- 
sons of strong spiritual perception feel this nearness and communion 
as their greatest solace. With others it may sometimes become a 
sttperstition, as indeed every other con.solatory belief may. It is a 
blessed and triumphant victory over human weakness when even a 
mother can see and handle the toys and garments of her departed 
little one, and feel grateful to God for having taken it into his safer 
keeping to grow up among the angels and reach the fulness of its 
immortal being by less painful processes than that of earth. It is a 
grand sight that of a venerable father bearing patiently and hopefully 
the death of a son whose talents and virtues were the praise of the 
neighborhood or the country. And how often does this happen, that 
one whose mathematical, scientific, artistic or literary genius gives 
promise of a long career of honor to himself and happiness to all con- 
nected with him is suddenly and mysteriously stricken down by 
fatal illness, which surprises the physician not less than the patient 
himself and those around him ! O what a calm and happy thing it 
is to feel, as one looks again at the face now still and calm in death, 
that the closed eyes of affection will open tenderly upon us when our 
own journey is over and that we shall meet again " some summer 
morning!" 

Such a hope is possible to all of us, because it is rational and in 
unison with the best feelings and yearnings of our nature. It does 
not require any dogma or logical process of proof. It is a feeling so 
deep in our nature that death is not omnipotent and that the material 
body cannot extinguish the bright and beautiful intelligence, that it 
k found a much harder task than they bargained for when the Infidel 



368 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

annihilationist tries to convert commonplace folks into the belief that 
human affections are only animal weaknesses, and that the love of 
parent to child is only that of the tiger or bear for its cubs. The 
divine light within us, no matter whether we be of this church or of 
that, or of no church at all, burns up at this dark and desolate ma- 
terialism, and answers calmly that if there be any immaterial principle 
in man at all, his best affections are not thus absolutely in the despotic 
power of matter. Many a lonely traveller on the road of life has gone 
through thirty or forty years, singing and making melody in the heart 
all the time, in the full faith and happy consciousness that the child 
or parent, the brother or si,ster they lost long years ago is still walk- 
ing silently beside them and holding them by the hand. A faith so 
pure and beautiful cannot be false. 

The ceremonies and all the attendant memories of death should 
symbolize this faith. Instead of the dark vault, there should be the 
green glades and the bright sunshine for the dead. Instead of a dark 
and narrow house, there should be the happy valley, the spreading 
landscape, the groves and trees, the smooth-flowing river, the merry 
peals of bells floating over hill and dale, and the melody of birds 
carolling their praises of life, not death. Instead of a year's mourn- 
ing, there should be some little mark of bereavement as a social token 
to one's neighborhood that we have a vacant chair in the household, 
and then the trappings of grief should give place to the ordinary 
work-day costume, the memento being still worn, as a forget-me-not 
for the absent one and a reminder to the wearer that a dear one 
who has gone up higher is now looking with the deepest interest 
and sympathy upon our life-work. Each anniversary of the beloved 
one's death should be kept as the birthday of his true life. Instead 
of selfishly repining that he has not shared our sufferings and sick- 
nesses, we ought rather to thank Heaven that the one we cherished 
more than our own life has been spared the bitter winds and raging 
tempest, and has been sleeping in the C^uiet haven of the heavenly rest 
while our raft of life has tossed and staggered on the stormy seas. 

As the world grows better, and we do not believe, in spite of all 



DEATH IN THE HOME. 369 

the pessimists and moral dyspeptics, that it is growing worse, one of 
the signs of a noble and true manhood and womanhood will be the 
victory over the superstition about death and the calm acquiescence 
in it as a note in the divine harmony and a beneficent release from 
a service of labor and suffering too heavy for the invalid to bear. In 
the garden of the Lord, as the old divines are fond of calling the 
scene where spiritual flowers are grown and tended, there are works 
of hard toil, digging, uprooting and planting ; but on the higher bank 
to which death carries us there is a sweeter gardening toil, which is 
indeed no toil at all, but a perpetual happiness. There are stray 
flowers of human thought and aspiration, scattered prayers and hopes 
which have beeh blown from the tree of life, which must be gathered 
up by hands etherealized by death and woven into immortal garlands 
that shall distil fragrance in the presence of God through the eternal 
Present of Eternity. May not dear baby's tiny fingers be twined 
about those scattered flowers, and the sweet lips that here could 
scarcely lisp " mamma " or " papa " have learned in that bright home 
the spirit of adoption, whereby it cries with full melodious note, "Abba, 
Father ! " May not the gifted brother, of whom we were so proud, 
have graduated there in higher studies, painted grander scenes, 
or composed sublimer symphonies? The patient wife, who toiled 
and sometimes wept in silent suffering during her brief companion- 
ship with a coarser though an honest mind, may be inspiring softer 
thoughts and holier feehngs into the husband who walks with head 
bowed down and weary feet without her. The home of which 
I have written in this book would be, indeed, imperfect if with 
its nursery and parlors, its library and kitchen, it had not a minaret 
or observatory touching the blue sky, from which we could take hold 
sometimes of the hands reached down to us from heaven. Let us 
be sure that however great a mystery death is, the pure love of the 
heart can never die, and that though the stars may fade with weari- 
ness from too long a vigil in the sky, the heart of the child will still 
turn to its mother and nestle to her breast, and that in heaven's 
nursery it will sit waiting patiently until "mamma" comes home.

HOME ARCHITECTUI|E. 



sHE desire to build a house for our own home and that 
of our family is a noble and humane ambition. It 
needs capital to do it, and capital is what the vast 
majority of human beings do not possess. The plan 
of gaining a freehold of property, little by little, as 
Israel of old gained possession of Canaan, is, however, becoming 
general everywhere, and is one of the progressive social aspects of 
the age and country in which we live. So much is this the case that 
both the United States government, the legislatures of single States, 
and many wealthy corporations formed by capitalists are either giv- 
ing grants of land in sections of the country that need population 
and industry, or are selling them on the terms of easy periodical 
payments. 

The great question, however, and one which is not sufficiently con- 
sidered by the prospective settler and house builder, is whether the 
plot of land is worth building upon, and whether its sanitary condi- 
tions make it desirable for a habitation. Many have built a tomb 
when they thought they were building a house. Instead of a home 
to live in, they have made a miniature hospital for themselves and 
their children to fall sick and die in. Bad drainage, stagnant water, 
whose poisonous exhalations and moisture have saturated the soil 
upon which the pretty house is built, have caused typhus and typhoid 
and the other forms of hydra-headed fever, chills and shiverings, 
malaria and ague, rheumatism, sick headaches and faintness, loss of 
appetite and strength, diphtheria and pneumonia, throat troubles and 
consumption. Whole families have died off, one by one, though the 
sky above them has been clear and the landscape around them beauii-

ful, because they have built their dwelHng on malarial soil and pesti- 
lential marsh land. Beneath the ground on which man walks there 
is sometimes hidden wealth in veins of minerals, and there is some- 
times also the damp and poison that will turn the little paradise into 
a graveyard. The first thing, therefore, is to dig before you plant ; 
to know thoroughly the nature of the soil ; to remedy all defects of 
drainage if you can, and if you can't, to pitch your tent elsewhere, 
although land agents tell you it is the finest and healthiest spot in 
creation and that your home would be a very palace of Aladdin. 

Having surveyed your land and explored what is beneath it, and, 
made sure that it will be an abode of life, not death, consider next its 
nearness to the necessary centres of social life. Unless you are a 
farmer you cannot make your house a depot of all the necessaries of 
life, although there is immense pleasure in amateur farming, in making 
one's own butter and cheese, keeping poultry, and eating home-made 
eggs and chickens as well as bread. Country life is very delight- 
ful when the family is large and visits to and from relations and friends 
are among the occasional sensations, but if Sydney Smith, when lo- 
cated upon Salisbury Plain, bewailed his isolation from the centres 
of civilization in being " four miles from a lemon," you must take 
care that you do not find yourself ten miles from a post-office, a 
church or a library. In other chapters of this volume I have given ; 
all the useful advice that occurred to my own " prospecting," as to 
the best plans for making home as complete and as independent of 
external sources of supply as possible, but, unhappily, the cases are 
too frequent all over the country of persons expending a great deal 
of pains and money in building houses only to vacate them after a 
year's disappointment and ennui in them, to make it superfluous to 
advise every one to think well before he settles in a spot " remote 
from towns." " Distance lends enchantment to the view '' when one 
is thinking of some beautiful villa, " far from the madding crowd," 
and where only "the tinkling sheep bells lull the distant folds," 
but when the cupboard is empty and there is neither butcher nor 
baker within reach, and the coal has given out, and the rain descends

and the winds blow, and the postman with his budget of newspapers 
is buried three feet deep in snow, and no " last new novel " is beside 
us to keep our facial muscles in exercise by its insipidity, then, be- 
lieve me, the " gentle hermit of the dale" and his wife and daughters 
are apt to wish themselves back again at the old number of the old 
town square or street. 

But you have considered all these antagonistic possibilities and 
you are about to build a house, either amid the mountains and lakes, 
the tall trees and green glades of nature or in the suburbs of a town, 
as the choice may be. And now you must thoroughly settle in 
your own mind precisely the kind of house you want, what the style 
of its architecture, what its internal arrangements, what its height, 
length and breadth, the number and size of the rooms, their " exits 
and their entrances," the equipment with everything needed for their 
special purpose, what that special purpose is to be, whether sewing- 
room, dining-room, drawing-room, nursery, kitchen or store-room. 
If you have a fine view and " every prospect pleases," and your house 
is to be high enough, by all means have a room above all others 
forming a tower or roof rather than a .spire, which shall be in sum- 
mer an observatory of the starry heavens by night and of the familiar 
fields, the glades and valleys, the winding river, the everlasting hills, 
and perhaps the far-spreading and resounding sea by day. Perhaps, 
one reason why St. Simeon Stylites lived on the top of a pillar was 
to be nearer the sky. Certainly no one who has looked out on an 
exhilarating summer morning upon the sun-bathed landscape from 
the top of a high house can have failed to feel that the delicious air 
and the soul-inspiring vision made him feel nearer heaven, if heaven 
be perfect peace and hope and love. 

But you cannot always be enjoying the outspread splendors of the 
seas and mountains, the dales and rivulets, nor can you live among 
the heavenly bodies. There are earthly bodies to be thought of as 
well as heavenly, and there is a science of gastronomy as well as of 
astronomy. Now, a great many house builders spend a great deal of 
taste and art and money upon a drawing-room which they seldom 



HOME ARCHITECTURE. 373 

enter, whose doors are locked and whose furniture is covered, while 
Ihey think that any odd corner, so it be near the water supply and 
the fence, will do for a kitchen. A vast deal of discomfort in the 
house arises from this foolish estimate of the relative uses of rooms 
and the spurious preference of show and ornament for real utility. 
Better do without your show drawing-room altogether, if your house 
is to be a small one, and be content with a real good dining-room, 
and a "thorough " kitchen with everything needed for physical com- 
fort and health in the apparatus of cooking, washing, churning, bread 
and pie making, so that whether your family and guests be few or 
many, and your meals simple or elaborate, you may have everything 
in comfort, and your cook may feel the kitchen a home for her skill, 
not a box in which she can do nothing properly and have nothing 
in order. For want of just such foresight and thorough prearrange- 
ment and predestination of every part, many villas and fine houses 
have'been built by wealthy persons which have afterward been called 
their "folly," for the want of prudence and good sense displayed in 
them. Sometimes they have thought that so long as the building 
covered a big area, it would be "just the thing." So they have con- 
structed what looks like a row of rooms opening into each other by 
interminable doors, the appearance of which outside is like a row of 
toy cottages strung together, and the feeling of which inside is that 
one is occupying no room in particular, but is passing through a 
suite, as a conductor passes through a line of steam-cars when he 
takes the tickets. It is really extraordinary the way in which some 
house builders rejoice in innumerable doors, while they seem to think 
that closets are altogether superfluous. Their idea seems to be that 
the proper feeling on entering a house should be that it is a good 
house to get out of, and therefore they supply the facilities for " going 
in at one door and out at the other." 

The subject of doors, closets, and staircases is of very great im- 
portance in the building of a house. Many houses have doors and 
staircases made like traps in the old feudal castles in which, through 
a trap-door, an undesirable guest went down impromptu into the

moat below and was swept away on the seething waters of a " lock.'' 
How often do we meet with persons who have been lamed or had 
concussion of the brain through stepping out through some inviting 
side-door either into mid-air or down the back stairs " head foremost ! " 
Sometimes the doors are so promiscuous and plentiful that you can- 
not open one door without its coming in collision with another, and 
then you have to keep your mind in a continual anxiety lest the other 
door should not be shut at the time you want to open your door. 
Perhaps, the other door is a closet or pantry in the wrong place and 
the children or the servants are always leaving it half open, and when 
the door of the room is half opened the two strike each other, and 
it is a question of knobs and hinges which will gracefully recede and 
allow the other to open fully, or whether they shall remain " locked 
in each other's embrace," while the party inside one door and the 
party outside the other door exchange compliments with each other. 

There are many things pertaining to house building which are 
proper to the limited understanding of man, but there are many 
more things in which the mind of women should have architectural 
and mechanical jurisdiction. The matter of closets is one for 
feminine arbitration. A man's imagination in this Department of 
domestic science does not extend further than the hat-rack upon 
which he hangs his ulster, beaver or wide-awake, and the umbrella- 
stand in which he deposits his gingham or walking-stick. But a 
woman knows that life without closet-room is life without order, and 
that home without plenty of storage room and pegs and shelves is 
chaos, confusion, and endless loss of time and goods. "A place for 
everything and everything in its place," is only a proverb expressive 
of the need of closet-room. 

A bright and happy future for the home will one day undoubtedly 
be given us by science, art and human perseverance, which shall 
make every house fireproof, and enable every one to sleep soundly 
without dread of being burned alive. As it is, if the desire of most 
house builders had been to provide an easy road for fire to travel 
upward and downward and sideways and all around, they could not

have accomplished it more successfully. Already the minds of our 
first architects are occupied with the grand life-saving problem of 
how to check a fire when it has been started by non-conducting de- 
vices between rooms, ceilings, floors and stairways. When that is 
once accomplished, as it will be, there will be no need of fire insur- 
ance companies. Moreover, the whole subject of house heating will 
be exhaustively considered and made the subject of prize essays and 
practical experiments until the evils of the stove, the range, the grate, 
the steam-pipes, the dry heat from furnaces, are all modified and cured 
and an equal temperature, without the infliction of gas from coal, or 
smoke, or excess and defect of warmth in one part of the house and 
another, will be diffused in dwelling-houses. To the present in- 
equality of temperature in houses one-half of the throat and lung 
complaints so prevalent among Americans are traceable. Our climata 
is not like that of the West Indies, where one lives with open doors all 
the year round, or even some parts of the United States, as Southern 
California, Florida and the Southern States, where nature does the 
greater part of the warming process for her human children. In the 
North, persons pass from the cold of a sharp winter's day out of doors 
to rooms in which the air is often "parched" with dry heat, or 
"steamed " like a Russian bath, or close with gas and smoke, and then 
there is wonder at the dry cough that becomes chronic with them. 
It is bad to sleep in a hot room, but it is worse still to sleep in an ir? 
tensely cold bed-room without any means of heating, when we are 
flushed and the pores of our skin are open by the heat of an over- 
warm sitting-room. 

All these questions belong to the building of a house, and should 
be well considered before the building of it is commenced. Health 
before ease, utility before ornament, comfort before luxury, are the 
fundamental principle^ which should guide the house builder. Let 
him look to these and secure perfect interior comfort and convenience, 
and ornament and decoration will come afterward. Some people be- 
gin all their enterprises at the wrong end and waste half their lives in 
trying to get perfection out of a bad design. No supplemental

building of extra rooms ever compensates for blunders in the main 
edifice. 

For the benefit of those who are intending to build houses of their 
own, the following designs and descriptions have been specially 
prepared and are offered to readers of " The Hearthstone : " 

This design (No. i) is a good illustration of the effect possible to be 
attained by the use of a few bold lines and projections with but very 
Jittle conventional detail. 

The roof of the original front building was destroyed by fire, leaving 
the walls intact. The problem was, to restore the essential loss, to 
make a bolder picture than the old one, and, if possible, at the same 
time to avoid an extraordinary expense. This was attempted without 
altering the ground lines or the old wall openings. 

An entirely new roof treatment was adopted; one result is, excellent 
rooms in the third story, and another an external effect which was a 
surprise as well as a pleasure to all interested. 

The roof covering is of red and black slates, and the walls were 
painted to harmonize, so that the color emphasizes the effect of light 
and shade. It is scarcely possible to do full justice, in an engraving 
m black and white, to this combination of light, shade, color and 
outline. Cost, $20,000. 

The design of the house illustrated by this drawing (No. 2) was pre- 
pared at the instance of a capitalist in the western part of Pennsylva- 
nia, who wishes to improve an eligible tract of land near a large city. 

It is his hope to build a number of such houses to rent to families 
of moderate income, whose business will permit them to pay ;^400 
or $500 rental per annum. 

The location is such as to require the entrance to face to the 
northwest, which accounts for the somewhat peculiar arrangement 
of the kitchen wing. 

The suggestion to build the first story of brick or stone comes 
from the prevailing feeling in every architect's mind which lends him 
to avoid the use of wood near the ground. It must be admitted that 
wood is the cheaper.

The bricks should be laid with red mortar. The sides of second 
story and gables are to be covered with wooden shingles and the 
roofs with slate, and the whole of the wood-wook painted in deep 
but quiet colors. 

The interior should be simply finished with white pine, very neatly 
wrought and fitted, and then coated with shellac so as to display the 
natural color and grain of the wood. 

A bit of tinted glass in the stair-windows, the hall floor smoothed 
and wax-varnished for a rug, two pretty little fireplaces with wood 
mantels, some neat little wooden cornice mouldings, some quiet tints 
on the walls, and then we must leave the rest to the good lady who 
comes along after us to put the soul of home into the somewhat 
chilly shell that the architect leaves. 

No. 3 is a brick residence with stone dressings. The tower over 
the front entrance, the balcony over front bay-window, with round, 
coupled columns supporting the eave, the portico over front door 
with coupled round columns and broken curved pediment, are a 
beautiful combination and are entirely new. 

The novel feature of the interior is the arrangement of the parlor 
and dining-room. It will be noticed that the doors are at the corner, 
while in the corners opposite are two fireplaces. By this arrange- 
ment a proper space is afforded for a piano in the parlor, and a buffet 
in the dining-room opposite the bay-window. The pantry is between 
the dining-room and kitchen, serving in a measure to exclude the 
smells of cooking. 

On the opposite side of the hall are the dining-room and library. 
This arrangement was designed to accommodate a clergyman. A 
much better arrangement would be to use the entire space for a 
drawing-room, and moving the bay-window to the centre of the long 
side. 

The servants' hall connects by a door with the front hall ; it also 
has an outside door. 

In the second story are four large and one small room and a ser- 
vants' room, all with large presses.

The bath is arranged at the end of the servants' hall. 

By making the house a little higher, four very good rooms can be 
made in the attic with windows, as shown in the gables, only larger. 
Dormer windows would add both to comfort and appearance. 

The laundry and furnace rooms are in the basement. The sides 
of this house are more commanding than the front. A slate roof in 
variegated colors would improve the appearance. This house, with 
slight alterations, can be built of wood. It is to be erected in southern 
Texas. 

No. 4 is a small cottage built at Ogden, Utah. It has, in addition, 
a kitchen ; the room marked kitchen on this plan being transformed 
into a dining-room. This addition and a front piazza can be added 
whenever the circumstances of the owner will admit of it. 

The projecting windows can be made of a single plank at the sides; 
they will add to the room as well as appearance. A good way to 
build this is to make a balloon frame, cover with rough hemlock 
boards, sheathing paper and clapboards. The roof to be treated in 
this way and shingled ; the shingles to be painted in two colors ; 
\he natural colors of slates are the most suitable for shingle roofs. 

There being four sleeping-rooms, the house has a good deal of 
Jccommodation for one that can be built for a less sum than two 
thousand dollars, including cellar. 

No. 5 is a small cottage built at Orangeburgh, South Carolina. 
It contains no culinary department, that being in a separate building, 
a custom prevalent at the South. 

The building stands on posts and is enclosed at the outer line of 
the piazza with close open-work, screening the unsightly posts and 
affording ample ventilation. 

Tlie gables of main roof are carried out to form porticos at either 
end, and the eaves are projected to form a piazza on either side. 
Both are cut away at each angle, but the floors are carried around 
full width. There is no other arrangement in architecture that will 
afford an equal amount of convenience in as good style at the same 
cost

Balconies can be added to second sotry windows with good effect. 
The interior is finished throughout with the natural pine of that lati- 
tude. The blinds are inside ; the roof of shingles. The exterior 
and roof should be painted sage green, with light, olive dressing, and 
black and vermilion chamfers. Do not undertake the latter unless 
some one of educated taste directs it ; better leave them off entirely. 

VV itn slight alterations this can be arranged for a family cottage in 
the North. The same style can be adopted in larger houses, dor- 
mers can be added, and a very commodious and pretentious house 
built for a comparatively small sum of money. 

No. 6 is the front elevation of a frame church and parsonage, 
which has been built at a cost of ^15,000 on Long Island. The 
style of the buildings is such as to give a marked ecclesiastical 
effect, although the treatment is very free to suit the location and the 
material. 

The outlines are picturesque, but much of the pleasing effect oi 
the building as actually erected is due to the painter's art in coloring 
in deep but quiet tones. Such a design could be totally ruined in 
the painting. It is therefore of the highest importance in wooden 
buildings that the best taste should be consulted in this part of the 
work. 

We have thus given six designs, which will fully illustrate all that 
is essential or necessary to those who may contemplate either build- 
ing or improving their homes, and it may be that some one of these 
designs will answer the wishes and tastes of a large number of our 
readers. 

The designs cannot fail to be of great interest to any who will care- 
fully examine them, and be highly appreciated as showing what can 
be done in the line of utility, beauty and attractiveness without in- 
volving the builders in that heavy burden which so many, so many 
American homes carry — mortgages and liens. 

We are very much indebted to two well-known architects who have 
kindly made these designs and written the description in such a 
manner as to be free from the ambiguity which usually belongs to

have dreams of what a home should be, will find in these practical 
designs pleasing suggestions for thought ; while to the families re- 
quiring and preparing to build houses, they can but be of value and 
interest.

THE KITCHEN IN THE HOME. 

I HAT food is to the body the kitchen should be to the 
home. Indeed, as Brillat-Savarin has said, "Tell me 
what you eat, and I will tell you what you are ; " so 
, one may say, Show me the kitchen, and I can form a 
good idea of the home. As the comfort and happi- 
ness of home do not depend upon vast room and 
costly furniture, and there is often far more peace and pleasure in a 
cottage than a palace, so the kitchen need not be a vast apartment in 
which many cooks are preparing many dishes, such as the wealthy 
Roman houses of two thousand years ago were famous for. But as 
every human life depends for its support upon food, so every human 
home must have a kitchen in which that food is prepared. The 
person who neglects food soon gets sick, and the home in which the 
kitchen is neglected is not a healthy or a happy home. 

It is strange how careless some housewives are in this matter. 
They are ever so particular that the room they sit in, and in which 
they receive their friends on state occasions, shall be spotlessly neat 
and comfortable, but they treat their kitchen as if it were a mere 
lumber room upon which dusting and cleaning and taste would be 
thrown away. Yet the kitchen ought to be as neat and clean as any 
room in the house, and when it is not so, it is a sign of bad manage- 
ment and carelessness about meals. Yet meals are the best evidences 
of a well or ill kept home. As one who comes to the table with un- 
washed hands is very likely to have also a dirty face, so a slovenly 
cloth, ill-cooked food, broken cups and saucers, greasy plates, and all 
things huddled together anyhow so as to get the meal over, as if it 

(395) 



39^ THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

were not meant to afford any pleasure — these are sure tokens that 
the home is not what it ought to be. 

The kitchen fire is the centre of warmth to the home, just as food 
renews life and warmth to the body. To be healthy in mind and 
body one must eat wholesome food. Too much food or too little ; 
food that is indigestible and innutritious in itself or becomes so 
through bad cooking ; eating when one is not hungry because it is 
the usual hour for eating, and not eating when one is really hungry 
because it is not the regular hour, are all causes of dyspepsia, an ail- 
ment that destroys sleep, good temper and pleasant thinking. An 
immense number of persons in all civilized countries suffer from this 
frightful nightmare of the stomach, and we Americans suffer more 
than any other people. The cause of this is not in any difference of 
constitution and the organs of digestion. It is caused by bad cook- 
ing, hasty eating, without using our teeth sufficiently upon what we 
eat, thus leaving to the unfortunate stomach the work meant for the 
teeth and jaws as well as its own. American business men will eat 
too much at one time, and then go too long a time without eating at 
all. They plead that they have been too busy to think about lunch 
or dinner ; that they were occupied with a big sale or a big purchase. 
Then, perhaps, late at night, when the stomach, like the brain, should 
not be called upon to do hard work, they cram down hunches of new 
bread and slices of cheese and butter, with perhaps a glass of milk 
and some pickles with vinegar to turn the whole sour, and then they 
get up in the night and rave and tear their hair and wonder what 
is the matter with them, and why they cannot get a wink of 
sleep. Next morning they feel bad and drink mineral waters before 
breakfast, thus further injuring the coats of the stomach, and they 
go through the day feeling that they are very badly used, and accus- 
ing every smiling face they meet of mocking at their misery, and 
wishing some one would only quarrel with them so as to give them 
an opportunity of speaking their mind and relieving their ill humor.

draw the fever from the head ; a mustard-plaster for the pit of the 
stomach, six cathartic liver pills to be taken at night and a horrid 
black draught to be drunk in the morning, and the poor man fancies 
he must be better and eats a pocketful of hard nuts, several unripe 
peaches, a clam-chowder or a dish of pork and beans, and then says 
the druggist is a fraud and medicine a humbug, and that life is not 
worth living, and wishes he were dead. Women vary this programme 
by pots of green tea, candies and heavy cake, or hot bread, with ice- 
cream and lemonade and any other irreconcilables they can get hold 
of Their children follow their example, and then wonder why their 
teeth decay and they feel so cross and uncomfortable and grow so 
sallow in complexion. Meanwhile, the pastry cook, confectioner, 
fruiterer, druggist and undertaker make a good profit out of the bodies 
they thus abuse ; and when the family doctor is called in and writes 
his prescription he knows very well that it will be of no service until 
they change their mode of living, which is just what they will 
not do. 

It is the kitchen in the home, not the doctor, that can remedy 
these ills. Plain, wholesome, nourishing food, made pleasant to the 
appetite by good cooking, will do more than drugs and doctors to 
set these groaning dyspeptics right. But the good food is too often 
spoiled by the bad cooking, and some cooks seem almost to take 
pains to cook badly. It is just as easy and just as difficult to do a 
thing the right way as to do it the wrong way, yet to hear some 
people talk about cooking one would think it required a lifetime to 
learn how to cook a steak or boil a potato. Of course, there is some 
art required even in the simplest piece of work. To boil an egg so 
that it be neither a lukewarm fluid nor a hard and flavorless ball is 
difficult, because it is difficult to keep one's attention fixed for four min- 
utes upon a given process, but it is easy if one fixes one's mind upon 
the clock and the boiling water. The number of those, however, who 
can really be trusted to boil an egg is surprisingly few. Most people 
are like King Alfred the Great who promised to mind the cakes on 
the fire, but forgot all about them, and very justly got his ears boxed 



398 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

by the housewife for letting her food spoil. To watch any object 
with undivided attention, even for a few minutes, is with the majority 
of persons a feat as difficult as the fabulous apple-shooting of William 
Tell. The mere consciousness that one has to do a thing prevents 
one's doing it. Those who doubt this have only to try to look into 
another person's eyes without moving a muscle, or laughing, wink- 
ing or wavering for five minutes. Nine persons out of ten will fail, 
and they will fail because of the double process of attention and con- 
sciousness of attention. The conscious effort makes the failure. They 
could do the same thing for a much longer time if they were not 
trying to do it. 

So with cooking; it is an easy thing to cook well, but it needs 
attention and pains, which few busy housewives or servants are will- 
ing to take. The joint may be only the ancient leg of mutton or rib 
of beef, but it needs frequent turning of position toward the fire that 
it may get equally roasted, and it needs frequent basting so that it 
may be brown and juicy. So, also, with making and baking a 
loaf of bread. It costs as much time and trouble to do it wrong an-d 
make it like a leaden lump, or to make it that most delicious of all 
bread food, far surpassing the richest cake, a perfect home-made 
cottage loaf with a " kissing crust," as children call' it in some parts 
of the country. 

If one is a thoroughly bad cook, as so many who profess 
to cook are, he or she should never attempt a perfectly simple 
dish, such as a roast joint or a broiled steak. These are too 
easily spoiled to bear any trifling. But let the bad cook confine 
him or herself to " made dishes," as they are called, in which the 
cook's hand is a hidden hand, and all sorts of flavorings disguise 
the maltreated meat. The Frenchman can serve you a dish of roast 
beef from the loins of a Paris cab-horse " retired from business," and 
■' a donkey what wouldn't go '' made into a curry will pass for venison. 
Many of my readers have heard the story of the Englishman who was 
travelling in China and who entered a restaurant to allay his hunger. 
Unfortunately the attendant, John Chinaman, knew no English, nor 



THE KITCHEN IN THE HOME. 399 

did the Englishman talk Chinese. He signified by raps upon his 
gastronomic region and a movement of the jaws which conveyed the 
idea of eating and being hungry that he wanted some dinner. When 
it was set before him he " fell to " with an appetite and thought it 
the most delicious dish he had ever partaken of Eager to know 
what he was eating, but not knowing how to make himself under- 
stood, he said to the Chinaman : " Quack, quack," meaning, " Is this 
duck ? " for it tasted so to him. The Chinaman gravely shook his 
head and replied : " Bow, wow," thus conveying to his hungry cus- 
tomer the fact that it was dog. Such is the disguising power of made 
gravy and sauces. 

The old philosopher of Athens who had the very cross wife used 
to make a rule when he went out to dinner — for it is very doubtful 
if he ever got any dinner at Jiome — of never eating of more than one 
dish, and never taking sauce with it. He used to say, that to need 
sauce with one's meat implied that the cook did not know his busi- 
ness, and that it was better to confine one's self to one dish, and not 
use one's self to luxuries, so that if the day of poverty came and one 
could not procure them he would not feel the want of them. Many 
wise men beside Socrates have preferred simple fare. It is said of 
old King George the Third that he always dined in the middle of the 
day, and that often in his walks about Windsor he would step into 
some cottage and partake of an apple-dumpling, and enjoy it far more 
than anything the cooks of castle and palace prepared for him. That 
poor old king was happier in this respect than his son. George the 
Fourth, who, when he was Prince-Regent, was accosted by a beggar 
who said he was famished with hunger. " Then I envy you," said 
the prince, " for hunger is a luxury I have never enjoyed." One who 
gorged himself constantly as he did might well say so, for he could 
have no real appetite or enjoyment of his surfeits. 

It is said that at the wedding of Charles the Sixth, of France, a 
skilful cook covered the great marble table of the royal palace with 
a hundred dishes prepared in a hundred different ways. Who would 
wish to have been there any more than at a banquet of Vitellius or 



400 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Apicius ? Yet there is an extreme the other way. An old vege- 
tarian once declared that he desired nothing for his eating except the 
garbage of the market-place. One might as well be Nebuchadnezzar 
at once and go grazing among the beasts of the field. But too much 
animal food dulls the mind and clogs the blood and is not healthy, 
especially for the young. There is a medium between the diet of 
Friar Tuck and that of Edwin, the " gentle hermit of the dale," who 
tells his long-lost Angelina : 

" No flocks that range the valley free 

To slaughter I condemn ; 
Taught by that Power that pities me, 

I learn to pity them : 
But from the mountain's grassy side 

A guiltless feast I bring ; 
A scrip with herbs and fruits supplied. 

And water from the spring." 

" What is one man's meat is another man's poison," is a true 
proverb. People differ in their food according to their health and 
appetite, as well as the climate they live in. In cold climates oil and 
fat are u.sed in quantities which would be revolting in other latitudes. 
In Russia they pour train-oil over pies to make them more palatable. 
and nutritious. It is related that Sir John Franklin when in the 
northern seas was horrified at seeing an Esquimau lad consume 
fourteen pounds of tallow candles for his dinner, and he would have 
eaten more if Sir John had not appeased his appetite with a huge 
lump of fat pork. 

Even in the same climate, however, men differ widely in their eat- 
ing and drinking. Milk, the simplest and most nourishing of all food, 
does not agree with persons of a bilious habit. Some persons, for the 
same reason, cannot eat eggs with impunity. While many in our 
own country are very fond of fried and greasy meat, others require it 
to be broiled over a clear fire and free from grease. The frying-pan 
certainly fries the grease into and the flavor and juice out of the meat. 
Fried oysters, which are a favorite dish with many, produce great 
discomfort and indigestion with others. 



THE KITCHEN IN THE HOME. 4OI 

Cooking utensils were generally much the same in ancient times 
and nations as in our own. The remains of an ancient cooking-stove 
at Pompeii contained a strainer, a stock-pot, a brazier by which, with 
a tripod placed upon it, food could be boiled, stewed, or fried. There 
was also a frying-pan with four circular holes in it which were prob- 
ably for cooking eggs. 

In choosing one's food, every one ought to bear in mind the kind 
of labor, physical and mental, which he has to perform. The Chinese, 
who live chiefly upon rice, are very industrious, but their physical 
strength gives way under labor which is easily performed by Americans 
and Europeans who eat meat. 

There are so many excellent manuals on the chemistry of food 
that any one can readily learn the relative amount of nutriment 
contained in every kind of food. While rice affords very little 
nourishment, oatmeal is an excellent " stand by," especially for brain 
workers. 

Let the kitchen be a central attraction of your home by its cleanli- 
ness and the excellence of your cooking. Nature intended man to 
enjoy his food as well as to keep himself alive by it. The simplest 
fare daintily spread before one is far more appetizing than a feast of 
all sorts of mixtures, just as a plain suit of clothes, perfectly neat and 
tidy, looks better than costly raiment bespattered with dirt. A good, 
wholesome table inspires the mind with a grateful sense of order and 
domestic art and leads to pleasant conversation, personal neatness and 
social enjoyment. When Talleyrand gave a grand dinner a fat French 
bishop sat next to him who was notorious for his gluttony, and al- 
ways carried his own man-servant along with him when he dined out, 
so that he might hand him what he knew to be his favorite dishes. 
After eating very largely on this occasion his eye caught sight of 
some dainty side-dish which he was not familiar with, and he desired 
his servant to get him some of it. He had his mouth open to swallow 
the last mouthful when he fell back dead in his chair, and the horri- 
fied guests all got up from the dinner-table. Who would prefer to 
fare sumptuously all one's life, as he had done, and then die of over-

eating, to living moderately upon natural and healthy food, with a 
clean palate, a sound liver, a good digestion, and an unclouded 
brain ? 

Some housewives display admirable skill in preparing tempting 
dishes at very little cost. This has not as yet been a frequent accom- 
plishment among American women. There is, however, no reason 
why it should not be. They have excelled in needlework and many 
other kinds of domestic art. Why should not the American kitchen 
be as famous for the skill and delicacy displayed in it as the French, 
which is the best, taking its variety and economy into consideration? 
The English kitchen is good, but is too solid for our climate and has 
very little variety. But in their deep dish fruit pies they are cer- 
tainly ahead of our American pies, which are masses of paste with 
just a little fruit from which all the juice has escaped. The German 
kitchen is even more solid than the English, and is too greasy for 
Americans. The Italians excel in some dishes, but their roast meats 
are oily and flavorless. Cookery books are too often like guide- 
books, which take you by a round-about way to where you did not 
want to go. The best teacher in the kitchen is experience, and ex- 
perience is learned by experiment. If one begins right, "practice 
makes perfect " in the kitchen as everywhere else.

§HERE is no more fruitful source of family discontent 
than poor cooking, and progress has not marked the 
department of the cook as it has other branches of 
home life. Cookeiy-books are numerous ; they multi- 
ply continually, yet practical recipes are scarce, and 
true and tried ones are a commodity much in demand. 

Whatever may have been said on the subject to the contrary, it is 
a fact that women desire to cook well, and they are ever on the look- 
out for reliable information on the subject. Housekeepers cannot 
rely upon servants, and the inevitable result is, and has been, that 
they are compelled to inform themselves regarding the duties of a 
cook. 

The accompanying recipes are intended for the women of the land 
who appreciate the importance of a practical knowledge of cookery 
and desire to master it. 

Why we Commence Dinner with Soup. — A clear soup disappears 
almost immediately after entering the stomach, and in no way inter- 
feres with the gastric juice, which is stored in its appropriate cells 
ready for action. The habit of commencing dinner with soup has, 
without doubt, the origin in the fact that aliment in this fluid form, 
in fact ready digested, soon enters the blood and rapidly refreshes 
the hungry man, who, after a considerable fast and much activity, sits 
down with a sense of exhaustion to commence his principal meal. 
In two or three minutes after he has taken a plate of good warm soup 
the feeling of exhaustion disappears, and irritability gives way to the 
gradually rising sense of good fellowship with the circle. Some

persons have the custom of allaying exhaustion with a glass of sherry 
before food — a gastronomic no less than a physiological blunder, in- 
juring the stomach and destroying the palate. The soup introduces 
at once into the system a small instalment of ready-digested food, 
and saves the short period of time which must be spent by the 
stomach in deriving some nutriment from solid aliment, as well as 
indirectly strengthening the organ of digestion itself for its forth- 
coming duties. 

Stock — General Remarks. — Stock being the basis of all meat- 
soups, and also of all the principal sauces, it is essential to the suc- 
cess of these culinary operations to know the most complete and 
economical method of extracting from a certain quantity of meat the 
best possible stock of broth. 

Beef makes the best stock; veal stock has less color and taste, 
whilst mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy smell, far from agreeable, 
unless the meat has been previously roasted or broiled. Fowls add 
very little to the flavor of stock, unless they be old and fat. 

Bones ought always to form a component part of the stock-pot. 

Brown meats contain more than white, and make the stock more 
fragrant. 

By roasting meat, the osmazome appears to acquire higher proper- 
ties ; so, by putting the remains of roast meats into your stock-pots, 
you obtain a better flavor. 

When the stock is well skimmed and begins to boil, put in salt 
and vegetables, which may be two or three carrots, two turnips, one 
parsnip, a bunch of leeks and celery tied together. 

You can add, according to taste, a piece of cabbage, two or three 
cloves stuck in an onion, and a tomato. 

The latter gives a very agreeable flavor to the stock. If fried onion 
be added, it ought, according to the advice of a famous French chef, 
to be tied in a little bag ; without this precaution, the color of the 
stock is liable to be clouded. 

Soups will, in general, take from three to six hours' doing, and are 
much better prepared the day before they are wanted. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4O5 

When soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot weather, 
they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded pans 
or tureens, and placed in a cool cellar. 

In temperate weather, every other day may be sufficient. 

Soups which are intended to constitute the principal part of a meal 
certainly ought not to be flavored like sauces, which are only designed 
to give a relish to some particular dish. 

Really good soup can never be made but in a well-closed vessel, 
although, perhaps, greater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional 
exposure to the air. 

Soft water should always be used for making soup, unless it be of 
green peas, in which case hard water better preserves its color ; and 
it is a good general rule to apportion a quart of water to a pound of 
meat — that is to say, flesh without bone ; but rich soups may have a 
smaller quantity of water. 

Meat for soup should never be drowned at first with water, but 
put into the kettle with a very small quantity and a piece of butter, 
merely to keep it from burning until the juices are extracted, by 
which means of stewing the gravy will be drawn from it before the 
remainder of the water is added. A single pound will thus afford 
better and richer soup than treble the quantity saturated with cold 
water ; but it will take six or eight hours to extract the essence from 
a few pounds of raw beef Bouilli beef is rendered very rich and 
palatable, though a considerable quantity of soup may be made from 
it, by being stewed at first in a little butter and some of its own 
gravy. 

To thicken and give body to soups and gravies, potato-mucilage, 
corn-starch, bread-raspings, isinglass, flour and butter, barley, rice or 
oatmeal in a little water, rubbed well together, are used. 

A piece of boiled beef, pounded to a pulp, with a bit of butter and 
flour, and rubbed through a sieve, and gradually incorporated with 
the soup, will be found an excellent addition. 

When the soup appears to be too thin or too weak, the cover of 
the boiler should be taken off, and the contents allowed to boil till 



4o6 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

some of the watery parts have evaporated, or some of the thickening 
materials above mentioned should be added. 

Never wash meat, as it deprives its surface of all its juices; sep- 
arate it from the bones, and tie it round with tape, so that its shape 
may be preserved ; then put it into the stock-pot, and for each pound 
of meat let there be one pint of water ; press it down with the hand, 
to allow the air which it contains to escape, and which often raises it 
to the top of the water. 

Economical Stock. — Take the liquor in which a joint of meat has 
been boiled, say four quarts; trimmings of fresh meat or poultry, 
shank-bones, etc., roast-beef bones, any pieces the larder may furnish ; 
two ounces of butter, two large onions, each stuck with cloves ; one 
turnip, three carrots, one head of celery, three lumps of sugar, two 
ounces of salt, half a teaspoonful of whole pepper, one large blade of 
mace, one bunch of savory herbs, four quarts and one-half pint of 
cold water. Let all the ingredients simmer gently for six hours, 
taking care to skim carefully at first. Strain it off, and put by for 
use. 

White Stock {to be used in the preparation of white soups). — Four 
pounds of knuckle of veal, any poultry trimmings, four slices of lean 
ham, three carrots, two onions, one head of celery, twelve white pep- 
percorns, two ounces of salt, one blade of mace, a bunch of herbs, 
one ounce of butter, four quarts of water. 

White or Medium Stock. — Four pounds of shin of beef, or four 
pounds of knuckle of veal, or two pounds of each ; any bones, trim- 
mings of poultry, or fresh meat, one-fourth pound of lean bacon or 
ham, two ounces of butter, two large onions, each stuck with cloves; 
one turnip, three carrots, one head of celery, three lumps of sugar, 
two ounces of salt, one-half teaspoonful of whole pepper, one large 
blade of mace, one bunch of savory herbs, four quarts and one-half 
pint of cold water. 

Cut up the meat and bacon, or ham, into pieces of about three 
inches square ; rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan ; put 
in one-half pint of water, the meat, and all the other ingredients. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 40/ 

Cover the stewpan, and place it on a sharp fire, occasionally stirring . 
its contents. When the bottom of the pan becomes covered with a 
pale, jelly-like substance, add the four quarts of cold water, and sim- 
mer very gently for five hours. As before said, do not let it boil 
quickly. Remove every particle of scum whilst it is doing, and 
strain it through a fine hair-sieve. 

This stock is the basis of many of the soups afterward mentioned, 
and will be found quite strong enough for ordinary purposes. Cook 
five and one-half hours. 

Mock-turtle Soup {Mrs. Reynolds' recipe). — Take a calf's head 
and feet; boil them until the meat separates from the bones. Pick the 
bones out and cut the meat in pieces, about an inch in size ; put it 
back, and boil it two hours more. Chop the brains fine ; add eight 
or nine onions and a little parsley ; mix the spice with this (mace, 
cloves, pepper and salt), and put it in the soup an hour or more be- 
fore it is done. Roll six or eight crackers with one-half pound of 
butter, and when nearly done drop it in. Brown a little flour and 
put in. Make force-meat balls of veal ; fry them, and put in the 
bottom of the tureen. 

Tomato Soup. — Take six large tomatoes ; boil in one pint of water 
until done ; then take them off the stove and stir in one teaspoonful 
of saleratus ; then add one quart of milk, and season with plenty of 
butter, pepper and salt. Let it all come to a boil, when it is ready 
for use. 

Lobster Soup. — Three large lobsters or six small ones ; the crumb 
of a French roll, two anchovies, one onion, one small bunch of sweet 
herbs, one strip of lemon-peel, two ounces of butter, a little nutmeg, 
one teaspoonful of flour, one pint of cream, one pint of milk ; force- 
meat balls, mace, salt and pepper to taste, bread-crumbs, one egg, 
two quarts of water. Pick the meat from the lobsters, and beat the 
fins, chine, and small claws in a mortar, previously taking away the 
brown fin and the bag in the head. Put it in a stewpan, with the 
crumb of the roll, anchovies, onions, herbs, lemon-peel, and the 
water ; simmer gently till all the goodness is extracted, and strain it 



THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

off Pound the spawn in a mortar, with the butter, nutmeg and flour, 
and mix with it the cream and milk. Give one boil up, at the same 
time adding the tails cut in pieces. Make the force-meat balls with 
the remainder of the lobster, seasoned with mace, pepper and salt, 
adding a little flour and a few bread-crumbs ; moisten them with the 
egg, heat them in the soup, and serve. Cook it two hours, or rather 
more. 

Vegetable Soup {good and cheap, made without meat). — Six pota- 
toes, four turnips, or two if very large ; two carrots, two onions ; if 
obtainable, two mushrooms ; one head of celery, one large slice of 
bread, one small saltspoonful of salt, one-quarter saltspoonful of 
ground black pepper, two teaspoonfuls of Harvey's sauce, six quarts 
of water. Peel the vegetables, and cut them up into small pieces ; 
toast the bread rather brown, and put all into a stewpan with the 
water and seasoning. Simmer gently for three hours, or until all is 
reduced to a pulp, and pass it through a sieve in the same way 
as pea soup, which it should resemble in consistence; but it should 
be a dark-brown color. Warm it up again when required; put in 
Harvey's sauce, and, if necessary, add to the flavoring. It should be 
cooked three hours, or rather more. 

Vegetable Soup (2). — Scrape clean and slice three carrots and 
three turnips ; peel three onions ; fry the whole with a little butter till 
it turns rather yellow ; then add two heads of celery cut in pieces, 
three or four leeks, also cut in pieces ; stir and fry the whole for about 
six minutes ; when fried, add also one clove of garlic, salt, pepper, 
two cloves, and two stalks of parsley ; cover with three quarts of 
water ; keep on rather a slow fire, 3kim off the scum carefully, and 
simmer for about three hours, then strain and use. 

Vegetable Soup (3). — Seven ounces of carrot, ten ounces of par- 
snip, ten ounces of potatoes cut in thin slices ; one and one-quarter 
ounce of butter, five teaspoonfuls of flour, a teaspoonful of made 
mustard, salt and pepper to taste ; the yolks of two eggs ; rather more 
than two quarts of water. Boil the vegetables in the water two and 
one-half hours ; stir them often, and if the water boils away too quickly 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4O9 

add more, as there should be two quarts of soup when done. Mix 
up in a basin the butter and flour, mustard, salt and pepper, with a 
teacupful of cold water ; stir in the soup and boil ten minutes. Have 
ready the yolks of the eggs in the tureen ; pour on, stir well, and 
serve. Time, three hours ; sufficient for eight persons. 

Potato Soup. — An excellent winter soup is made by taking four 
pounds of mealy potatoes, boiled or steamed very dry ; pepper and 
salt to taste ; two quarts of stock. When the potatoes are boiled, 
mash them smoothly that no lumps remain, and gradually add them 
to the boiling stock ; pass it through a sieve, season, and simmer for 
five minutes. Skim well, and serve with fried bread. Half an hour 
for cooking. 

Rice Soup. — Four ounces of rice, salt, cayenne and mace, two 
quarts of white stock. Mode: Throw the rice into boiling water, 
and let it remain five minutes ; then pour it into a sieve, and allow 
it to drain well. Now add it to the stock boiling, and allow it to 
stew till it is quite tender ; season to taste. Serve quickly. Cook 
one hour. 

Turnip Soup. — Three ounces of butter, nine good-sized turnips, 
four onions, two quarts of stock, seasoning to taste. Melt the butter 
in the stewpan, but do not let it boil ; wash, drain and slice the tur- 
nips and onions very thin ; put them in the butter, with a teacupful 
of stock, and stew very gently for an hour. Then add the remainder 
of the stock, and simmer another hour. Rub it through a taminy, 
put it back into the stewpan, but do not let it boil. Serve very hot. 
It will require two hours and a half to cook this soup. 

Cabbage Soup. — Take one large cabbage, three carrots, two onions, 
four or five slices of lean bacon, salt and pepper to taste, two quarts 
of medium stock. Scald the cabbage, cut it up and drain it. Line 
the stewpan with the bacon, put in the cabbage, carrots and onions ; 
moisten with skimmings from the stock, and simmer very softly till 
the cabbage is tender ; add the stock, stew softly for half an hour, 
and carefully skim off" every particle of fat. Season and serve. 
Time, one hour and a half; seasonable in winter; sufficient for eight 
persons, 



4IO THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Carrot Soup. — Use four quarts of liquor in which a leg of mutton 
CM- beef has been boiled, a few beef-bones, six large carrots, two large 
onions, one turnip ; seasoning of salt and pepper to taste ; cayenne. 
Put the liquor, bones, onions, turnip, pepper and salt, into a stew- 
pan, and simmer for three hours. Scrape and cut the carrots thin, 
strain the soup on them, and stew them till soft enough to pulp 
through a hair-sieve or coarse cloth ; then boil the pulp with the soup, 
which should be of the consistency of pea soup. Add cayenne. Pulp 
only the red part of the carrot, and make this soup the day before it 
is wanted. Time, four hours and a half This quantity is sufficient 
for ten persons. 

Queen Victoria's Favorite Soup. — The soup which Queen Vic- 
toria prefers above all others, and is known as " Potage a la Reine," 
is made as follows : Three fat chickens are to be drawn and washed 
in warm water, and then stewed down in strong veal broth and a 
bunch of parsley for an hour ; take out the fowls and soak two 
French brioches or rolls in the liquor; then the flesh of the chickens 
being taken 'off the bones, and cut up fine, discarding the skin, gristle, 
sinews, etc. ; now put this meat and the soaked rolls, together with 
the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, into a stone mortar and pound 
them to a smooth paste ; replace this paste in the soup ; stir well 
together, and force it through a coarse sieve into a tureen ; add to 
this one quart of boiled cream ; make all very hot, and send to table. 

Beef Soup [economical). — Take the bone left from the steak, boil 
it two hours ; skim off the fat, add half a tablespoonful of shred 
gelatine, one onion, pepper, salt, parsley, summer-savory, a table- 
spoonful of tomato catsup, and a teacupful of washed rice ; then peel 
three potatoes, cut in halves, or, if very large, cut in quarters ; throw 
them in the soup, with crusts of bread or biscuit. If the bone is large 
the gelatine can be omitted ; it adds richness to the soup. This recipe 
is calculated to make three quarts with the vegetables. 

Beef Soup {Mrs. Reynolds' recipe). — To a shin-bone, put three 
onions, one large white turnip, a large handful of potatoes, after they 
are sliced; salt and pepper. Put the meat in cold water, and boil it 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4I I 

slowly until tender; add the vegetables and boil them about one hour; 
then stand it away until the next day, then skim off the fat; chop 
up a head of celery ; put a little brown flour in ; strain the vegetables 
out if you want it nice. Chop up the meat and put in if desired. 

Green Corn and Tomato Soup {Mrs. Patterson! s recipe). — Six ears 
of good, sweet corn, cut off fine. One dozen tomatoes skinned and 
sliced. Put corn and tomatoes into the vessel for cooking, and 
pour in half a gallon of boiling water, and let it cook slowly for an 
hour. When ready to serve, add half a gallon of sweet milk (to have 
it very nice), and use no water but what it is cooked in. Two ounces 
of butter, teaspoonful of black pepper, salt to taste. As soon as it 
boils, now, it is ready to serve. Those who prefer to have the flavor 
of onion in it, can cut up a small one very fine and put it into the 
tureen and pour the soup over it. Irish potatoes may be substituted 
for corn. 

Oyster Soup. — Six dozen oysters, two quarts of white stock, one- 
half pint of cream, two ounces of butter, and one and a" half ®unce 
of flour ; salt and pepper to taste. Scald the oysters in their own 
liquor ; take them out, beard them, and put them in a tureen. Take 
a pint of the stock, put in the beards and the liquor, which must be 
carefully strained, and simmer for half an hour. Take it off the fire, 
strain it again, and add the remainder of the stock with the season- 
ing. Bring it to a boil, add the thickening of butter and flour, sim- 
mer for five minutes, stir in the boiling cream, pour it over the oysters, 
and serve. This quantity of oysters will make soup for eight persons, 
or more if the oysters are large. This soup can be made less rich by 
using milk instead of cream. 

Oyster Soup (2). — Two quarts of good mutton broth, six dozen 
oysters, two ounces butter, one ounce flour. Beard the oysters, and 
scald them in their own liquor ; then add it, well strained, to the 
broth ; thicken with the butter and flour, and simmer for quarter of 
an hour. Put in the oysters, stir well, but do not let it boil, and 
serve very hot. 

Macaroni Soup. — Three ounces of macaroni, a piece of butter the 



412 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

size of a walnut, salt to taste, two quarts of clear stock. Throw the 
macaroni and butter into boiling water with a pinch of salt, and sim- 
mer for half an hour. When it is tender, drain and cut it into thin 
rings or lengths, and drop it into the boiling stock. Stew gently 
for fifteen minutes, and serve grated Parmesan cheese with it. Three- 
quarters of an hour is sufficient time to cook it. 

Pea Soup with Celery. — One-quarter pound each of onions and 
carrots, two ounces of celery, three-quarters of a pound of split peas, a 
little mint shred fine, one tablespoonful of coarse brown sugar, salt 
and pepper to taste, four quarts of water, or liquor in which a joint 
of meat has been boiled. Fry the vegetables for ten minutes in a 
little butter or dripping, previously cutting them up in small pieces ; 
pour the water on them, and when boiling add the peas. Let them 
simmer for nearly three hours, or until the peas are thoroughly 
done. Add the sugar, seasoning, and mint ; boil for quarter of an 
hour, and serve. 

Pea Soup. — Boil split peas till they are in a thorough mash ; melt a 
little finely chopped suet well in a pan, frizzle in it a finely chopped 
onion; mix this with the peas; add more warm water to make the 
soup; then pepper, salt, and powdered sage; let it simmer well for 
twenty minutes. 

Vermicelli Soup. — One and one-half pound of bacon, stuck with 
cloves; one-half ounce of butter worked up in flour; one small fowl, 
trussed for boiling ; two ounces of vermicelli, two quarts of white 
stock. Put the stock, bacon, butter and fowl into the stewpan, and 
stew for three-quarters of an hour. Take the vermicelli, add it to a 
little of the stock, and set it on the fire till it is quite tender. It 
should be cooked two hours. When the soup is ready, take out the 
fowl and bacon, and put the bacon on a dish. Skim the soup as clean 
as possible ; pour it, with the vermicelli, over the fowl. Cut some 
bread thin, put in the soup, and serve. 

Stew Soup. — Half a pound of beef mutton, or pork ; half a pint 
of split peas, four turnips, eight potatoes, two onions, two ounces 
Df oatmeal or three ounces of rice, two quarts of water. Cut the 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4I3 

meat into small pieces, as also the vegetables; and add them, with 
the peas, to the water. Boil gently for three hours ; thicken with the 
oatmeal, boil for another quarter of an hour, stirring all the time, and 
season with pepper and salt. It is a good winter soup. This soup 
may be made of the liquor in which tripe has been boiled, by adding 
vegetables, seasoning, rice, etc. 

Turkey Soup {a seasonable dish at Christmas). — Two quarts of 
medium stock, the remains of a cold roast turkey, two ounces of 
rice-flour or arrowroot, salt and pepper to taste, one tablespoonful 
of Harvey's sauce or mushroom catsup. Cut up the turkey in small 
pieces and put them in the stock; let it simmer slowly until the 
bones are quite clean, which will be in about four hours. Take the 
bones out, and work the soup through a sieve ; when cold, skim well. 
Mix the rice-flour or arrowroot to a batter with a little of the soup; 
add it with the seasoning and sauce or catsup. Give one boil and 
serve. Seasonable at Christmas. Instead of thickening this soup, 
vermicelli or macaroni may be served in it. 

Cucumber Soup {French recipe). — Pare one cucumber, quarter it. 
and take out the seeds; cut it in thin slices; put these on a plate with 
a little salt to draw the water from them ; drain, and put them in 
your stewpan, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut. When they 
are warmed through, without being browned, pour the stock on them. 
Add sorrel, cut in large pieces, a little chervil, and seasoning, com- 
posed of salt and pepper to taste, the yolks of two eggs, one gill of 
cream, one quart of medium stock, and boil for forty minutes. Mix 
the well-beaten yolks of the eggs with the cream, which add at the 
moment of serving. 

Hodge-podge. — Two pounds of shin of beef, three quarts of water, 
one pint of table-beer, two onions, two carrots, two turnips, one head 
of celery; pepper and salt to taste; thickening of butter and flour. 
Put the meat, beer and water in a stewpan, simmer for a few minutes, 
and skim carefully. Add the vegetables and seasoning ; stew gently 
till the meat is tender. Thicken with butter and flour, and serve 
with turnips and carrots. Or spinach and celery. 



414 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

Asparagus Soup. — One and one-half pint of split peas, a teacupful 
of gravy, four young onions, one lettuce cut small, one-half head of 
celery, one-half pint of asparagus cut small, one-half pint of cream, 
three quarts of water ; color the soup with spinach juice. Boil the 
peas, and rub them through a sieve ; add the gravy, and then stew 
by themselves the celery, onions, lettuce and asparagus with the 
water. After this, stew all together, and add the coloring and serve. 
Time : Peas two and one-half hours; vegetables one hour; altogether, 
four hours. 

Mutton Soup. — A neck of mutton, about five or six pounds, three 
carrots, three turnips, two onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, in- 
cluding parsley ; salt and pepper to taste ; a little sherry, if liked ; 
three quarts of water. Lay the ingredients in a covered pan before 
the fire, and let them remain there the whole day, stirring occasionally. 
The next day put the whole into a stewpan, and place it on a brisk 
fire. When it commences to boil, take the pan off the fire, and put 
it one side to simmer until the meat is done. When ready for use, 
take out the meat, dish it up with carrots and turnips, and send it to 
table ; strain the soup, let it cool, strain off all the fat, season and 
thicken it with a tablespoonful, or rather more, of arrowroot ; flavor 
with a little sherry, simmer for five minutes, and serve. 

Force-meats. — For force-meats special attention is necessary. 
The points which cooks should, in this branch of cookery, more par- 
ticularly observe, are the thorough chopping of the suet, the com- 
plete mincing of the herbs, the careful grating of the bread-crumbs, 
and the perfect mixing of the whole. These are the three principal 
ingredients of force-meats, and they can scarcely be cut too small, 
as nothing like a lump or fibre should be anywhere perceptible. 
To conclude, the flavor of no one spice or herb should be permitted 
to predominate. 

Force-meat for Pike, Carp, Haddock and various kinds of 
Fish. — Ingredients : One ounce of fresh butter, one ounce of suet, 
one ounce of fat bacon, one small teaspoonful of minced savory herbs, 
including parsley ; a little onion, when liked, shred very fine ; salt, 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4I5 

nutmeg and cayenne to taste ; four ounces of bread-crumbs, one egg. 
Mix all the ingredients well together, carefully mincing them very 
fine ; beat up the egg, moisten with it, and work the whole very 
smoothly together. Oysters or anchovies may be added to this force- 
meat, and will be found a great improvement. 

Force-meat for Veal, Turkeys, Fowls, Hare, etc. — Two ounces 
of ham or lean bacon, one-quarter pound of suet, the rind of half a 
lemon, one teaspoonful of minced parsley, one teaspoonful of minced 
sweet herbs ; salt, cayenne and pounded mace to taste ; six ounces of 
bread-crumbs, two eggs. Shred the ham or bacon, chop the suet, 
lemon-peel and herbs, taking particular care that all be very finely 
mixed ; add a seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne and mace, and blend 
all thoroughly together with the bread-crumbs before wetting. Now 
beat and strain the eggs, work these up with the other ingredients, 
and the force-meat will be ready for use. When it is made into balls, 
fry of a nice brown in boiling lard, or put them on a tin and bake for 
half an hour in a moderate oven. As we have stated before, no one 
flavor should predominate greatly, and the force-meat should be of 
sufficient body to cut with a knife, and yet not dry and heavy. For 
very delicate force-meat, it is advisable to pound the ingredients to- 
gether before binding with the eggs; but, for ordinary cooking 
mincing very fine answers the purpose. Sufficient for a turkey or 
a hare. 

FISH. 

General Directions for Dressing.^ — Great care and punctuality 
are necessary in cooking fish. If not done sufficiently, or if done too 
much, it is not good. It should be eaten as soon as cooked. 

Salmon, mackerel, herrings and trout soon spoil or decompose 
after they are killed ; therefore, to be in perfection, they should be 
prepared for the table on the day they are caught. 

With flatfish this is not of such consequence, as they will keep 
longer. 

The turbot, for example, is improved by being kept a day or two. 



4l6 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

In dressing fish of any kind, the first point to be attended to is to 
see that it be perfectly clean. It is a common error to wash it too 
much, as by doing so the flavor is diminished. 

If the fish is to be boiled, a little salt and vinegar should be put 
into the water to give it firmness, after it is cleaned. 

Codfish, whiting and haddock are none the worse for being a little 
salted and kept a day ; and, if the weather be not very hot, they will 
be good for two days. 

When fish is cheap and plentiful, and a larger quantity is purchased 
than is immediately wanted, the overplus of such as will bear it should 
be potted, or pickled, or salted, or hung up ; or it may be refried, 
that it may serve for stewing the next day. Fresh water fish, having 
frequently a muddy smell and taste, should be soaked in strong salt 
and water, after it has been well cleaned. If of a sufficient size, it 
may be scalded in salt and water, and afterward dried and dressed. 

Fish should be put into cold water, and set on the fire to do very 
gently, or the out-side will break before the inner part is done. Un- 
less the fish is small, it should never be put into warm water; nor 
should water, either hot or cold, be poured on to the fish, as it is 
liable to break the skin — if it is necessary to add a little water whilst 
the fish is cooking, it ought to be poured in gently A the side of the 
vessel. The fish-plate may be drawn up to see if the fish be ready, 
which may be known by its easily separating from the bone. It 
should then be immediately taken out of the water, or it will become 
woolly. 

The fish-plate should be set crossways over the kettle, to keep hot 
for serving, and a cloth laid over the fish to prevent its losing its 
color. 

In garnishing fish, great nicety is required, and plenty of parsley, 
horseradish and lemon, or eggs boiled hard and cut in slices, should 
be used. 

If fried parsley be used, it must be washed and picked, and thrown 
into fresh water. When the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley 
into it immediately from the water, and instantly it will be green and 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4I7 

crisp, and must be taken up with a slice. Well dressed, and with 
very good sauce, fish is more appreciated than almost any other dish. 
The liver and roe, in some instances, should be placed on the dish, 
in order that they may be distributed in the course of serving; 
but to each recipe is appended the proper mode of serving and 
garnishing. 

If fish is to be fried or broiled, it must be dried in a nice, soft cloth 
after it is well cleaned and washed. 

If for frying, brush it over with egg, and sprinkle it with some fine 
crumbs of bread. 

If done a second time with the egg and bread, the fish will look so 
much the better. 

If required to be very nice, a sheet of white blotting-paper must 
be placed to receive it, that it may be free from all grease. 

It must also be of a beautiful color, and all the crumbs appear 
distinct. 

Butter gives a bad color; lard and clarified dripping are most 
frequently used ; but oil is the best, if the expense be no objection. 
The fish should be put into the lard when boiling, and there should 
be a sufficiency of this to cover it. 

When fish is broiled, it must be seasoned, floured and laid on a 
very clean gridiron, which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of 
suet to prevent the fish from sticking. 

It must be broiled over a very clear fire, that it may not taste 
smoky; and not too near, that it may not be. scorched. 

Trout Cooking. — The trout is a peculiar fish ; it requires great 
nicety in cooking or its flavor is lost. The flavor of the brook trout 
is exceedingly delicate and must be dealt with in a gentle manner. 

Brook trout should never be placed in boiling water but over 
steam ; boiling it in water soddens it and takes away its flavor. 
When steaming it put into the water some peppercorns and a very 
little salt. 

A sauce for trout may be made of melted butter and parsley, or 
capers or tomatoes, or even mushrooms. Trout deserves a delicate 
(lavoring. 



4l8 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

A second way of cooking trout is to melt a piece of fresh butter, 
stir into it some water, and place the trout into it, adding pepper- 
corns and a little salt. Place round several slices of lemon and cover 
up very close. Stew like this twenty minutes. Take out and strain 
the gravy over the trout. 

If you wish the gravy thickened, one teaspoonful of flour stirred 
into the butter will be sufficient. 

Cover the trout with a piece of greasy paper and let it gently frizzle 
in the pan, or put pieces of bacon under it and over it anci let it frizzle. 

Make a fine salad to this dish. 

Steam a trout, and when cold pour over it some oil .iiixed with 
vinegar, pepper and salt, and a little tomato catsup. 

A brook trout must have no elaborate cooking, but ;>*st enough 
flavoring to enhance its native aroma. 

To Broil a Shad. — Shad should be well washed and dried. It 
may be cut in half and broiled, or you may split it opep and lay a 
small quantity of salt over it, and lay it upon a gridiron, wel- buttered. 
It will broil in about twenty minutes, and should be thoroughly done. 
Melted butter may be served in a sauce-boat with it. Shac^ is even 
more palatable when baked than broiled. 

To Bake Shad. — It should be stuffed with mashed potatoes and 
chopped parsley. Lay it in the oven on a pan which is well tovered 
with butter chopped in pieces ; baste the fish with butter, aitd add 
fresh quantities as fast as it is absorbed. Half or three-quarter* of a 
pound of butter should be used for a large-sized shad. 

To Dress Shad. — Scale, empty, and wash the fish carefully > and 
make two or three incisions across the back. Season it with pejjper 
and salt and lay it in oil for a few minutes. Broil on both sides ^ver 
a clear fire and serve with caper-sauce. 

Baked Fish. — Take blue-fish, bass or shad for this purpose; m^ke 
a dressing of bread as for poultry, only adding a little salt pc-rk 
chopped fine, and no herbs ; fill the fish with the dressing, and stew 
or tie it up ; then put a few slices of salt pork in a pan, and very 
little water; lay the fish in the pan, and put a few slices of salt pork 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4I9 

over it , bake it, according to its size, from one-half an hour to an 
hour, 

Pharisee Clams. — Boil the clams until they are open, or a little 
longer; then chop fine, mix them with bread-crumbs, pepper and 
butter ; put them in the shell or oyster-shells, and brown them in 
the oven. 

Clams. — The very best way of cooking clams is to chop them up 
very fine first, no matter whether large or small. In this way clam 
soups and chowders give repose afterwards, and not melancholy. 

Boiled Shoulder of Cod. — Take the upper half of a fresh cod, 
well dressed, put in a napkin, place in boiling water with salt, and let 
it boil thirty or forty minutes, according to its size. Turn out upon 
a hot platter, and serve only the fish without skin or bone. 

Salt-fish Chowder. — Cover the bottom of a kettle with slices 
of salt pork; fry to a light brown. Remove the kettle from the fire. 
Put in first a layer of pared and sliced potatoes, then bits of codfish 
(not too much), then a layer of potatoes, and so on. Sprinkle peppei 
on each layer. Add water sufficient to cover. Stew slowly until 
the potatoes are well cooked ; then add crackers, half a pint of milk, 
and a thicken of flour and water. Let it simmer five minutes. 

Nantucket Chowder. — Have five pounds of codfish cut into 
steaks ; take a medium-sized onion, cut in slices or chopped ; a quartet 
of a pound of fat, salt pork — a little more would do no harm ; chop 
the pork and put it with the onions in the bottom of a large sauce- 
pan or kettle ; let them fry together until the onions are brown ; then 
have four medium-sized potatoes also chopped ; put a layer of fish, 
seasoning with salt and pepper, on top of the pork and onions, then 
a layer of potatoes, and so on, until all is in the kettle ; pour over it 
three quarts of water, and let if boil half an hour; soak half a dozen 
crackers in a pint of milk, and the chowder is almost done; turn the 
crackers and milk into it. 

How TO Cook Codfish. — Wash, pick up a little, and soak it for a 
long time — say four or five hours in summer, or all night in winter — 
in warm v/ater ; change the water and drain ; pick out the bones, and 



420 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

heat it scalding hot, but do not boil ; make some good milk-gravy, 
adding cream, if you have it, and butter (a small piece), with a dash 
of pepper; let this boil a little, then add the fish in about the propor- 
tion of a pint of soaked fish to a quart of gravy. Never let the codfish 
boil; it hardens it. 

To Dress Lobster, Cold. — Take the fish out of the shell, divide it 
into small pieces, mash up the scarlet meat of the lobster, prepare a 
salad mixture of cayenne pepper, salt, sweet oil, vinegar and mustard; 
mix the lobster and the mixture well together, and serve them in 
the dish in which they were mixed. Lobster is usually dressed at 
table. 

Lobster Patties. — Minced lobster, four tablespoonfuls of bechamel, 
six drops of anchovy sauce, lemon juice, cayenne to taste. Line the 
patty-pans with puff-paste, and put into each a small piece of bread ; 
cover with paste, brush over with egg, and bake to a light color. 
Take as much lobster as is required, mince the meat very fine, and 
add the above ingredients ; stir it over the fire for five minutes ; re- 
move the lids of the patty-cases, take out the bread, fill with the 
mixture, and replace the covers. Time : About five minutes after the 
patty-cases are made. 

Lobster Salad. — One hen lobster, lettuces, endive, small salad 
(whatever is in season), a little chopped beet-root, two hard-boiled eggs, 
a few slices of cucumber. For dressing, four tablespoonfuls of oil, 
and two of vinegar, one teaspoonful of made-mustard, the yolks of 
two eggs; cayenne and salt to taste; one-quarter teaspoonful of an- 
chovy sauce. These ingredients should be mixed perfectly smooth 
and form a creamy-looking sauce. Wash the salad, and thoroughly 
dry it by shaking it in a cloth. Cut up the lettuces and endive, pour 
the dressing on them, and lightly throw in the small salad. Mix all 
well together with the pickings from the body of the lobster ; pick 
the meat from the shell, cut it up into nice, square pieces, put half in 
the salad, the other half reserve for garnishing. Separate the yolks 
from the whites of two hard-boiled eggs ; chop the whites very fine 
and rub the yolks through a sieve, and afterward the coral from the 



COOKERY RECIPES. 421 

inside. Arrange the salad lightly on a glass dish and garnish, first 
with a row of sliced cucumber, then with the pieces of lobster, the 
yolks and whites of the eggs, coral and beet-root placed alternately, 
and arranged in small, separate bunches, so that the colors contrast 
nicely. 

To Boil Lobsters. — One-quarter pound of salt to each gallon of 
water. Buy the lobsters alive, and choose those that are heavy and 
full of motion, which is an indication of their freshness. When the 
shell is incrusted it is a sign they are old ; medium-sized lobsters are 
the best. Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, salted in the above 
proportion, put in the lobster, and keep it boiling quickly from twenty 
minutes to three-quarters of an hour, according to its size, and do not 
forget to skim well. If it boils too long the meat becomes thready, 
and if not done enough the spawn is not red ; this must be obviated 
by great attention. Rub the shell over with a little butter or sweet- 
oil, which wipe off again. Time : Small lobsters, twenty minutes to • 
half an hour ; large ones, one-half to three-quarters of an hour. 

Stewed Eels. — Two pounds of middling-sized eels, one pint of 
medium stock, one-quarter pint of port wine, salt, cayenne and mace 
to taste; one teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, the juice of half a 
lemon. Skin, wash and clean the eels thoroughly; cut them into 
pieces three inches long, and put them into strong salt and water for 
one hour, dry them well with a cloth, and fry them brown. Put the 
stock on with the heads and tails of the eels, and simmer for half an 
hour ; strain it, and add all the other ingredients. Put in the eels, 
stew gently for half an hour, when serve. Cook two hours. 

Boiled Salmon. — Six ounces of salt to each gallon of water; suf- 
ficient water to cover the fish. Scale and clean the fish, and be par- 
ticular that no blood is left inside ; lay it in the fish-kettle with sufficient 
cold water to cover it, adding salt in the above proportion. Bring 
it quickly to a boil, take off all the scum, and let it simmer gently till 
the fish is done, which will be when the meat separates easily from 
the bone. Experience alone can teach the cook to fix the time for 
boiling fish ; but it is especially to be remembered that it should never 



^22 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

be under-dressed, as then nothing is more unwholesome. Neither let 
it remain in the kettle after it is sufficiently cooked, as that would 
render it insipid, watery and colorless. Drain it, and if not wanted 
for a few minutes, keep it warm by means of warm cloths laid over it. 
Serve on a hot napkin, garnish with cut lemon and parsley, and send 
lobster or shrimp sauce, and plain, melted butter to table with it. 
A dish of dressed cucumber usually accompanies this dish. It will 
require eight minutes' time to cook each pound, for large, thick 
salmon, and six minutes for thin fish. Cut lemon should be put on 
the table with this fish, and a little of the juice squeezed over it is 
considered by many persons a most agreeable addition. 

Salmon and Caper-sauce. — Two slices of salmon, one-quarter 
pound of butter, one-half teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one shallot, 
salt, pepper and grated nutmeg to taste. Lay the salmon in a bak- 
ing-dish, place pieces of butter over it, and add the other ingredients, 
rubbing a little of the seasoning into the fish ; when done, take it out 
and drain for a minute or two, lay it in a dish, pour caper-sauce over 
it and serve. Salmon dressed in this way, with tomato sauce, is very 
delicious. Cook about three-quarters of an hour. 

Pickled Salmon. — Salmon, one-half ounce of whole pepper, one- 
half ounce of whole allspice, one teaspoonful of salt, two Jsay leaves, 
equal quantities of vinegar and the liquor in which the fish was boiled. 
After the fish comes from the table, lay it in a nice dish with a cover 
to it, as it should be excluded from the air, and take away the bone ; 
boil the liquor and vinegar with the other ingredients for ten min- 
utes, and let it stand to get cold ; pour it over the salmon, and in 
twelve hours this will be fit for the table. 

Stuffed and Baked Fish. — Soak bread in cold water until soft ; 
drain off the water, mash the bread fine ; mix it with a tablespoonful 
of melted butter, a little pepper and salt. Cut, smother, add spices 
if preferred. A couple of raw eggs make the dressing. Sew up 
the fish after putting in the dressing, and lay the fish in a baking- 
pan, where a teacup of water and a small piece of butter had been pre- 
viously put. Bake it from forty to fifty minutes. Fresh cod, bass 
and shad are suitable fish for baking. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 423 

To Fry Fish. — The secret of frying fish well consists in having 
enough put in the spider. Let them fry slowly over a moderate and 
steady heat. All fish should be fried in the purest oil. This can be 
used over and over again by clarification ; and, all things considered, 
oil is quite as economical as lard or drippings. Clean your pan, put 
therein sufficient oil to thoroughly and deeply immerse the fish. 
Permit this to boil, and it will attain so high a temperature that when 
a finger of bread is dipped into it and instantly drawn out, the bread 
has acquired a brown surface, or a piece of white paper dipped into 
it comes out dry, then — and not until then — your fish, already egged 
and bread-crumbed, is launched lightly on the surface of the oil, the 
boiling power of which will keep it afloat, and then, according to 
the thickness of the fish, from two to three minutes should be given 
to it ; then turn it gently with flat tongs. 

Fried Smelts. — The smelt is a very nice little fish, which has a 
peculiarly sweet and delicate flavor of its own, that requires, to be 
tasted in perfection, no other cooking than plain broiling or frying in 
fresh lard. Do not wash them, but wipe them dry in a clean cloth ; 
having opened and drawn them, and cut off" the heads and tails, dredge 
them with flour. The frying-pan must be more than two-thirds full 
of boiling lard ; boiling hard when the smelts are put in, so as to float 
them on the surface. Cook ten or fifteen minutes, according to size. 

Sardines. — Sardines are not only delicious reli.shes for warm days, 
just as they are taken from their boxes, with no other sauce save the 
oil they are preserved in, but they are susceptible of a number of 
ways of dressing and serving. They may be " grilled " in the fol- 
lowing manner : Open a box containing one dozen sardines, remove 
the skins and place the sardines on a tin plate in the oven till they 
are heated through. Meanwhile pour the oil from the sardines into 
a small saucepan, set it on the fire, and when it boils put in an even 
tablespoonful of flour ; stir well ; then add gradually two gills of weak 
stock or water. Boil till it is as thick as rich cream, then add one 
teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce with salt and plenty of cayenne 
pepper ; beat together the yolk of one egg, one teaspoonful of French 



424 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

mustard and one teaspodnful of vinegar. Pour the sauce boiling hot 
on the egg and other ingredients, stir a moment, then pour it over 
the sardines, which have been previously placed upon slfces of toast. 
Serve at once upon hot plates. 

Curried sardines are also very fine. They must be prepared as 
above and put on toast, but a different sauce is poured over them. 
Put the oil from the sardines in a small saucepan, add a very small 
onion or clove of garlic. When the oil boils add one tablespoonful 
of flour and one teaspoonful of curry powder, then add two gills of 
stock and boil until a good consistency is reached ; then pour it upon 
the yolk of an egg beaten with a half teaspoonful of lemon juice ; add 
cayenne pepper and salt ; pour it over the sardines and serve hot. 

Another method is to remove the skin and dress them cold, with 
salt and pepper, and serve them with lettuce or cold-slaw and thin 
slices of bread and butter before other dishes. 

OYSTERS. 

Oyster Soup. — Make your stock of liquor to the quantity of two 
quarts with any sort of fish the place affords ; put one pint of oysters 
into a saucepan, strain the liquor, stew them five minutes in their own 
liquor; then pound the hard parts of the oysters in a mortar with the 
yolks of three hard eggs ; mix them with some of the soup, then lay 
them with the remainder of the oysters and liquor in a saucepan, with 
nutmeg, pepper and salt. Let them boil a quarter of an hour, when 
they will be done. 

Broiled Oysters. — Oysters are nice broiled in their shells or laid 
in shells for the purpose ; they must be cooked over a bed of hot coals, 
and butter and pepper added in the shell. Serve hot. 

To Stew Oysters. — -To stew oysters, open them and strain the 
liquor. Put to them some grated stale bread, and a little pepper and 
nutmeg. Throw them into the liquor, and add a glass of white wine. 
Let them stew but a short time, or they will be hard. Have ready 
some slices of 'buttered toast with the crust off. When the oysters 
are done, dip the toast in the liquor and lay the pieces around the 



COOKERY RECIPES. 42$ 

sides and in the bottom of a deep dish. Pour the oysters and liquor 
upon the toast, and send them to the table hot. 

Another Way. — Strain the oyster liquor ; rinse the bits of shells 
off the oysters ; then turn the liquor back on the oysters, and put 
them in a stewpan. Set them to boil up, then turn them on to but- 
tered toast. Salt, pepper and butter to suit the taste. 

To Fry Oysters. — Make a batter, then, having washed your oysters 
and wiped them dry, dip them into the batter, and roll them in some 
crumbs of bread or crackers finely beaten. Fry them as any other 
fish. A simpler way to fry oysters is to drain them off the liquor ; 
roll each oyster in finely grated crackers, and fry in a hot pan with 
sufficient fat. Salt and pepper before taking them up, and then upon 
the dish add a little butter. 

Oysters or Clam Fritters. — One and a half pints of milk ; one 
and a quarter pounds of flour ; four eggs — whites and yolks beaten 
separately — whites stirred in lightly at first. Clams must be chopped 
small ; oysters used whole. 

Scolloped Oysters. — Three pints of oysters will make two dishes. 
First a layer of oysters ; then cover them with crackers rolled fine 
with a little butter, pepper, salt, and with the liquor of the oysters. 
Then another layer of oysters covered in the same way with crackers, 
and put in the oven and bake. Have them nicely browned on the top. 

MEATS. 

Broiling. — The utensils used for broiling need but little descrip- 
tion. The common gridiron used in all our kitchens is the same as 
it has been for ages past, although some little variety has been intro- 
duced into its manufacture by the addition of grooves to the bars, by 
means of which the liquid fat is carried into a small trough. 

One point it is well to bear in mind, viz., that the gridiron should 

be kept in a direction slanting toward the cook, so that as little fat 

as possible may fall into the fire. It has been observed that broiling 

is the most difficult manual office the general cook has to perform, 

and one that requires the most unremitting attention ; for she may turn 
27 



426 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

her back upon the stewpan or the spit, but the gridiron can never be 
left with impunity. 

Frying. — This very favorite mode of cooking may be accurately 
described as boiling in fat or oil. 

Substances dressed in this way are generally well received, for 
they introduce an agreeable variety, possessing as they do a peculiar 
flavor. 

By means of frying, cooks can soon satisfy many requisitions made 
on them, it being a very expeditious mode of preparing dishes for 
the table, and one which can be employed when the fire is not suffi- 
ciently large for the purposes of roasting and boiling. 

The great point to be borne in mind in frying is that the liquid 
must be hot enough to act instantaneously, as all the merit of this 
culinary operation lies in the invasion of the boiling liquid, which 
carbonizes or burns at the very instant of the immersion of the body 
placed in it. 

It may be ascertained if the fat is heated to the proper degree by 
cutting a piece of bread and dipping it into the frying-pan for five or 
six seconds ; and if it be firm and of a dark brown when taken out, 
put in immediately what you wish to prepare ; if it be not, let the fat 
be heated until of the right temperature. 

This having been effected, moderate the fire, so that the action 
may not be too hurried, and that by a continuous heat the juices of 
the substance may be preserved and its flavor enhanced. 

It is to be especially remembered, in connection with frying, that 
all dishes fried in fat should be placed before the fire on a piece of 
blotting-paper, or sieve reversed, and there left for a few minutes, so 
that any superfluous greasy moisture may be removed. 

Boiling, or the preparation of meat by hot water, though one of 
the easiest processes in cookery, requires skilful management. 
Boiled meat should be tender, savory, and full of its own juice, or 
natural gravy ; but, through the carelessness and ignorance of cooks, 
it is too often sent to table hard, tasteless and innutritious. To insure 
a successful result in boiling flesh, the heat of the fire must be judi- 



COOKERY RECIPES. 42/ 

ciously regulated, the proper quantity of water must be kept up in the 
pot, and the scum which rises to the surface must be carefully re- 
moved. Many writers on cookery assert that the meat to be boiled 
should be put into cold water, and that the pot should be heated 
gradually ; but Liebig, the highest authority on all matters connected 
with the chemistry of food, has shown that meat so treated loses 
some of its most nutritious constituents. " If the flesh," says the 
great chemist, " be introduced into the boiler when the water is in a 
state of brisk ebullition, and if the boiling be kept up for a few min- 
utes and the pot then placed in a warm place, so that the tempera- 
ture of the water is kept at 158° to 165°, we have the united 
conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which best fit it for 
being eaten." When a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water, 
the albumen which is near the surface immediately coagulates, form- 
ing an envelop which prevents the escape of the internal juice, and 
most effectually excludes the water, which, by mixing with this juice, 
would render the meat insipid. The time allowed for the operation 
of boiling must be regulated according to the size and quality of the 
meat. As a general rule, twenty minutes, reckoning from the mo- 
ment when the boiling commences, may be" allowed for every pound 
of meat. All the best authorities, however, agree in this, that the 
longer the boiling the more perfect the operation. The vessels used 
for boiling should be made of cast-iron, well tinned within, and 
provided with closely-fitting lids. They must be kept scrupulously 
clean, otherwise they will render the meat cooked in them unsightly 
and unwholesome. Copper pans, if used at all, should be reserved 
for operations that are performed with rapidity, as, by long contact 
with copper, food may become dangerously contaminated. The kettle 
in which a joint is dressed should be large enough to allow room 
for a good supply of water ; if the meat be cramped and be sur- 
rounded with but little water, it will be stewed, not boiled. In stew- 
ing it IS not requisite to have so great a heat as in boiling. A gentle 
simmering in a small quantity of water, so that the meat is stewed 
almost in its own juices, is all that is necessary. 



428 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Stewing is the cheapest mode of cooking meats. It should be 
done slowly, the pan partly uncovered, and frequently skimmed. 

Stewed Tripe. — Five pounds of tripe cut in small pieces. Two 
onions cut in slices and fried in half-pound of lard ; put in the tripe 
and let it cook a little, then add a cup of vinegar, a bowl of beef- 
broth, salt, pepper, and three tablespoonfuls of flour; mix the whole, 
and let it stew about fifteen minutes. 

Boiled Round of Beef. — As a whole round of beef, generally 
speaking, is too large for small families, and very seldom required, 
we here give the recipe for dressing a portion of the best side of the 
round. Take from twelve to sixteen pounds, after it has been in 
salt about ten days; just wash off the salt, skewer it up in a nice, 
round-looking form, and bind it with tape, to keep the skewers in 
their places. Put it in a saucepan of boiling water, set it upon a good 
fire, and when it begins to boil, carefully remove all scum from the 
surface, as, if this is not attended to, it sinks on to the meat, and 
when brought to table presents a very unsightly appearance. When 
it is well skimmed, draw the pot to the corner of the fire and let it 
simmer very gently until done. Remove the tape and skewers, which 
should be replaced by a silver one ; pour over it a little of the pot- 
liquor and garnish with carrots. Carrots, turnips, parsnips, and some- 
times suet dumplings, accompany this dish ; and these may all be 
boiled with the beef The pot-liquor should be saved and converted 
into pea soup ; and the outside slices, which are generally hard and 
of an uninviting appearance, may be cut off before being sent to table, 
and potted. These make an excellent relish for the breakfast or lunch- 
eon-table. Time : Twelve pounds, three hours after the water boils. 

Roasted Meats. — Roasted meats are really daked meats; but ovens 
are now so well made and ventilated that there is little difference of 
flavor in the two processes. Allow ten minutes to the pound if the 
meat is liked rare, and from twelve to fifteen if well done. It is 
always better to place the meat on a stand made to fit easily in the 
roasting-pan, so that it may not become sodden in the water used for 
gravy. Put into a hot oven, that the surface may soon sear over and 



COOKERY RECIPES. 429 

hold in the juices, enough of which will escape for the gravy. All 
rough bits should have been trimmed off, and a joint of eight or ten 
pounds rubbed with a tablespoonful of salt. Dredge thickly with 
flour, and let it brown on the meat before basting it, which must be 
done as often as once in fifteen minutes. Pepper lightly. If the 
water in the pan dries away, add enough to have a pint for gravy 
in the end. Dredge with flour at least twice, as this makes a 
crisp and relishable outer crust. Take up the meat, when done, on 
a hot platter. Make the gravy in the roasting-pan, by setting it on 
top of the stove, and first scraping iip all the browning from the 
corners and bottom. If there is much fat, pour it carefully off If 
the dredging has been well managed while roasting, the gravy will 
be thick enough. If not, stir a tablespoonful of browned flour smooth 
in cold water, and add. Should the gravy be too light, color with 
a tablespoonful of caramel, and taste to see that the seasoning is 
right. 

Broiled Beefsteaks or Rumpsteaks. — Select steaks and have 
ready a piece of butter the size of a walnut ; salt to taste, one table- 
spoonful of good mushroom catsup, or Worcestershire sauce. As the 
success of a good broil depends on the state of the fire, see that it is 
bright and clear, and perfectly free from smoke, and do not add any 
fresh fuel just before you require to use the gridiron. Sprinkle a 
little salt over the fire, put on the gridiron for a few minutes to get 
thoroughly hot through ; rub it with a piece of fresh suet to prevent 
the meat from sticking, and lay on the steaks, which should be cut 
of an equal thickness, about three-quarters of an inch, or rather thin- 
ner, and level them by beating as little as possible with a rolling-pin. 
Turn them frequently with steak-tongs ; if these are not at hand, stick 
a fork in the edge of the fat, so that no gravy escapes, and in from 
eight to ten minutes they will be done. Have ready a very hot dish, 
into which put the catsup, and, when liked, a little minced shallot ; 
dish up the steaks, rub them over with butter, and season with pepper 
and salt. The exact time for broiling steaks must be determined by 
taste, whether they are liked underdone or well done ; more than 



430 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

from eight to ten minutes for a steak three-quarters of an inch in 
thickness, we think, would spoil and dry up the juices of the meat. 
Great expedition is necessary in sending broiled steaks to table; and 
to have them in perfection, they should not be cooked till everything 
else prepared for dinner has been dished up, as their excellence en- 
tirely depends on their being served very hot. Garnish with scraped 
horse-radish or slices of cucumber. Oyster, tomato, onion, and many 
other sauces are frequent accompaniments to rumpsteak, but true 
lovers of this English dish reject all additions but pepper and salt. 

Seasonable all the year, but not good in the height of summer, as 
the meat cannot hang long enough to be tender. 

Broiled Beef-bones. — Separate the bones of ribs or sirloin, taking 
care that the meat on them is not too thick in any part ; sprinkle 
them well with salt and pepper, and broil over a very clear fire. 
When nicely browned they are done, but do not allow them to 
blacken. 

To Clarify Beef-dripping. — Good and fresh dripping answers 
very well for basting everything except game and poultry, and, when 
well clarified, serves for frying nearly as well as lard. It should be 
kept in a cool place, and will remain good some time. To clarify it, 
put the dripping into a basin, pour over it boiling water, and keep 
stirring the whole to wash away the impurities. Let it stand to cool, 
when the water and dirty sediment will settle at the bottom of the 
basin. Remove the dripping, and put it away in jars or basins for 
use. 

Beef a la Mode, — Six or seven pounds of the thick flank of beef, 
a few slices of fat bacon, one teacupful of vinegar, black pepper, all- 
spice, two cloves, well mixed and finely pounded, making altogether 
one heaped teaspoonful ; salt to taste ; one bunch of savory herbs, 
including parsley, all finely minced and well mixed ; two onions, two 
large carrots, one turnip, one head of celery, one and one-half pint of 
water, one glass of port wine. Slice and fry the onions of a pale 
brown, and cut up the other vegetables in small pieces, and prepare 
the beef for stewing in the following manner : Choose a fine piece of 



COOKERY RECIPES. 43 1 

beef, cut the bacon in long slices, about an inch in thickness, dip them 
into vinegar, and then into a little of the above seasoning of spices, 
etc., mixed with the same quantity of minced herbs. With a sharp 
knife make holes deep enough to let in the bacon ; then rub the beef 
over with the remainder of the seasoning and herbs, and bind it up 
in a nice shape with tape. Have ready a well-tinned stewpan (it 
should not be much larger than the piece of meat you are cooking), 
into which put the beef, with the vegetables, vinegar and water. Let 
it simmer very gently for five hours, or rather longer should the 
meat not be extremely tender, and turn it once or twice. When 
ready to serve, take out the beef, remove the tape, and put it on a 
hot dish. Skim off every particle of fat from the gravy, add the port 
wine, just let it boil, pour it over the beef, and it is ready to serve. 
Great care must be taken that this does not boil fast, or the meat will 
be tough and tasteless ; it should only just bubble. When convenient, 
all kinds of stews, etc., should be cooked on a hot plate, as the process 
is so much more gradual than on an open fire. This will be a suffi- 
cient quantity for seven or eight persons. 

Beef a la Mode {Virginia fashion). — Use the round of beef and 
remove the bone ; and for eight pounds allow half a pint of good 
vinegar, one large onion minced fine ; half a teaspoonful each of 
mustard, black pepper, cloves and allspice ; and two teaspoonfuls of 
brown sugar. Cut half a pound of fat salt pork into lardons, or 
strips, two or three inches long and about half an inch square. Boil 
the vinegar with the onion and seasoning, and pour over the strips 
of pork, and let them stand till cold. Then pour off the liquor, and 
thicken it with bread or cracker crumbs. Make incisions in the beef 
at regular intervals — a carving steel being very good for this pur- 
pose — and push in the strips of pork. Fill the hole from which 
the bone was taken with the rest of the pork and the dressing, and 
tie the beef firmly into shape. Put two tablespoons of dripping or 
lard in a frying-pan, and brown the meat on all sides. This will 
take about half an hour. Now put the meat on a trivet in the kettle ; 
half cover with boiling water ; and add a tablespoon of salt, a tea- 



432 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

spoonful of pepper, an onion and a small carrot cut fine, and two or 
three sprigs of parsley. Cook very slowly, allowing half an hour to 
a pound, and make gravy by the directions given for it in the pre- 
ceding receipt. Braised beef is prepared by either method given 
here for d la mode beef, but cooked in a covered iron pan, which 
comes for the purpose, and which is good also for beef d la mode, or 
for any tough meat which requires long cooking, and is made ten- 
derer by keeping in all the steam. 

Beefsteak Pie. — -Three pounds of rump-steak, seasoning to taste 
of salt, cayenne and black pepper, crust water, the yolk of an &gg. 
Have the steaks cut from a rump that has hung a few days, that they 
may be tender, and be particular that every portion is perfectly sweet. 
Cut the steaks into pieces about three inches long and two wide, 
allowing a small piece of fat to each piece of lean, and arrange the 
meat in layers in a pie-dish. Between each layer sprinkle a season- 
ing of salt, pepper, and, when liked, a few grains of cayenne. Fill 
the dish sufficiently with meat to support the crust, and to give it a 
nice raised appearance when baked, and not to look flat and hollow. 
Pour in sufficient water to half fill the dish, and border it with paste. 
Brush it over with a little water, and put on the cover ; slightly press 
down the edges with the thumb, and trim off close to the dish. 
Ornament the pie with pieces of paste cut in any shape that fancy 
may direct, brush it over with the beaten yolk of an egg, make a 
hole in the top of the crust, and bake in a hot oven for about one 
hour and a half Beefsteak pies may be flavored in various ways, 
with oysters and their liquor, mushrooms, minced onions, etc. For 
family pies suet may be used instead of butter or lard for the crust, 
and clarified beef-dripping answers very well where economy is an 
object. Pieces of underdone roast or boiled meat maybe used in pies 
very advantageously, but always remove the bone from pie-meat 
unless it be chicken or game. 

Baked Beefsteak Pudding. — One and a half pounds of rump- 
steak, one kidney, six ounces of flour, two eggs, not quite one pint 
of milk, salt to taste, pepper and salt. Cut the steak into nice square 



COOKERY RECIPES. 433 

pieces with a small quantity of fat, and divide the kidney into small 
pieces ; make a batter of flour, eggs and milk in the above propor- 
tion ; lay a little of it at the bottom of the pie-dish ; then put in the 
steak and kidney, which should be well seasoned with pepper and 
salt, and pour over the remainder of the batter. Bake for one and a 
half hours in a brisk but not fierce oven. 

To Pickle Beef for Winter Use and for Drying. — Cut the 
beef into suitable pieces, sprinkle a little salt on the bottom of the 
barrel, pack the beef without adding salt, and when nicely packed, 
pour over it a brine made by dissolving six pounds of salt for each 
one hundred pounds of beef, in sufficient cold water to cover it. In 
three weeks such pieces as are designed for drying will be ready to 
hang up by soaking them over night to remove the salt from the 
outside. 

To Keep dried beef and hams away from flies, pack them in dry salt. 
This is better than ashes, oats, sawdust, or anything of the kind. 

Italian Beefsteak. — Score a steak transversely with a sharp 
knife, cutting it through ; lay it in a stew-pan, with a small piece of 
butter ; season with pepper and salt, and an onion chopped fine. Let 
it cook three-quarters of an hour in its own gravy, and serve hot. 

Beefsteak. — The tenderloin is the best for broiling. If the beef 
is not very tender it should be laid on a board and pounded before 
broiling or frying it. Wash it in cold water, then lay it on a grid- 
iron, place it on a hot bed of coals, and broil it as quick as possible 
without burning it, Beef-toast is prepared by chopping fine the 
remnants of beefsteak or cold roast-beef It should be warmed up 
with a little water, and seasoned with butter, salt and pepper. Slices 
of bread should be toasted and laid on a platter, on which the meat 
is to be turned when hot. 

Boiled Tongue. — In choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it 
has been dried or pickled, and select one with a smooth skin, which 
denotes its being young and tender. If a dried one, and rather hard, 
soak it at least for twelve hours previous to cooking it : if, however, 
it is fresh from the pickle, two or three hours are sufficient for it to 



434 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

remain in soak. Put the tongue into a stew-pan with plenty of cold 
water and a bunch of savory herbs ; let it gradually come to a boil, 
skim well and simmer very gently until tender. Peel off the skin, 
garnish with tufts of cauliflowers or Brussels sprouts, and serve. 
Boiled tongue is frequently sent to table with boiled poultry instead 
of ham, and is, by many persons, preferred. If to serve cold, peel it, 
fasten it down to a piece of board by sticking a fork through the root, 
and another through the top to straighten it. When cold, glaze it, 
and put a paper ruche round the root, and garnish with tufts of 
parsley. Cook a large smoked tongue from four to four and a half 
hours ; a small one two and a half to three hours. A large unsoaked 
tongue three to three and a half hours ; a small one two to two and 
a half hours. Seasonable at any time. 

Boiled Breast of Mutton and Caper-sauce. — Breast of mut- 
ton, bread crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of minced savory herbs (put a 
large proportion of parsley), pepper and salt to taste. Cut off the 
superfluous fat ; bone it ; sprinkle over a layer of bread crumbs, 
minced herbs and seasoning, roll and bind it up firmly. Boil gently 
for two hours. Remove the tape, and serve with caper-sauce, a 
little of which should be poured over the meat. Cook two hours. 

Warmed-over Meats. — Boiled or roasted veal makes a nice dish, 
chopped fine and warmed up, with just sufficient water to moisten it, 
and a little butter, salt and pepper added. A little nutmeg and the 
grated rind of a lemon improve it — none of the white part of the lemon 
should be used. When well heated through, take it up on a platter, 
and garnish it with a couple of lemons cut in slices. 

Fresh or corned beef is good minced fine, with boiled potatoes, 
and warmed up with salt, pepper, and a little water — add butter just 
before you take it up. Some people use the gravy that they have 
left the day before for the meat, but it is not as good when warmed 
over, and there is no need of its being wasted, as it can be clarified, 
and used for other purposes. Boiled onions or turnips are good mixed 
with minced meat instead of potatoes. 

Veal, lamb and mutton are good cut into small strips, and warmed 



COOKERY RECIPES. 435 

with boiled potatoes cut in slices, pepper, salt, a little water — add 
butter just before you take it up. Roast beef and mutton, if not 
previously cooked too much, are nice cut in shoes, and just scorched 
on a gridiron. 

Meat, when warmed over, should be on the fire just long enough 
to get well heated through; if on too long, most of the juices of the 
meat will be extracted, and rendered very indigestible. 

Cold fowls are nice jointed and warmed with a little water, then 
taken up and fried in butter till brown. A little flour should be 
sprinkled on them before frying. Thicken the water that the fowls 
were warmed in, add a little salt, pepper and butter, and turn it over 
the fowls. 

Sausages. — Chop fresh pork very fine, the lean and fat together 
(there should be rather more of the lean than the fat) ; season it highly 
with salt, pepper, sage and other sweet herbs. If you like them, a 
little saltpetre tends to preserve them. To tell whether they are 
seasoned enough, do up a little in a cake and fry it. If not seasoned 
enough, add more seasoning, and fill your skins, which should be 
previously cleaned thoroughly. A little flour mixed in with the 
meat tends to prevent the fat from running out when cooked. 
Sausage-meat is good done up in small cakes and fried. In summer, 
when fresh pork cannot be procured, very good sausage cakes may 
be made of raw beef, chopped fine with salt pork, and seasoned with 
pepper and sage. When sausages are fried they should not be pricked, 
and they will cook nicer to have a little fat put in the frying-pan with 
them. They should be cooked slowly. If you do not like them very 
fat, take them out of the pan when nearly done, and finish cooking 
them on a gridiron. Bologna-sausages are made of equal weight each 
of ham, veal and pork, chopped very fine, seasoned high, and boiled 
in casings till tender, then dried. 

• Roast Haunch of Venison. — Choose a haunch with clear, bright, 
and thick fat, and the cleft of the hoof smooth and close — the greater 
quantity of fat there is the better quality will the meat be. As many 
people object to venison when it has too much haut goUt, ascertain 



43^ THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

how long it has been kept by running a sharp skewer into the meat 
close to the bone. When this is withdrawn, its sweetness can be 
judged of. With care and attention it will keep good for a long 
time during the winter, unless the weather is very mild. Keep it per- 
fectly dry by wiping it with clean cloths till not the least damp re- 
mains. When required for use, wash it in warm water, and dry it 
well with a cloth. Butter a sheet of white paper, put it over the fat ; 
lay a coarse paste, about half an inch in thickness, over this, and then 
a sheet or two of strong paper. Tie the whole firmly on to the 
haunch with twine, and put the joint down to a strong, close fire ; 
baste the venison immediately, to prevent the paper and string from 
burning, and continue this operation, without intermission, the whole 
of the time it is cooking. About twenty minutes before it is done, 
carefully remove the paste and paper, dredge the joint with flour, and 
baste with butter until it is nicely frothed, and of a nice pale-brown 
color ; garnish the knuckle-bone with a frill of white paper, and serve 
with a good, strong, but unflavored, gravy in a tureen, and currant- 
jelly ; or melt the jelly with a little port wine, and serve that also in 
a tureen. As the principal object in roasting venison is to preserve 
the fat, the above is the best mode of doing so where expense is not 
objected to ; but, in ordinary cases, the paste may be dispensed with, 
and a double paper placed over the roast instead. It will not require 
so long cooking without the paste. Do not omit to send very hot 
plates to table, as the venison fat soon freezes. To be thoroughly 
enjoyed by epicures, it should be eaten on hot water plates. The 
neck and shoulder may be roasted in the same manner. A large 
haunch of buck-venison, with the paste, should be cooked from three 
and a quarter to three and three-quarters of an hour. Allow less 
time without paste. 

This is a large amount, and would be sufficient for a party of 
eighteen persons. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — A leg of mutton for boiling should not 
hang too long, as it will not look a good color when dressed. Cut 
off the shank-bone, trim the knuckle, and wash and wipe it very 



COOKERY RECIPES. 437 

clean ; plunge it into sufficient boiling water to cover it, let it boil up. 
Then draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, where it should remain 
till the finger can be borne in the water. Then place it sufficiently 
near the fire, that the water may gently simmer, and be very careful 
that it does not boil fast, or the meat will be hard. Skim well, add a 
little salt, and in about two. and a quarter hours after the water begins 
to simmer, a moderate-sized leg of mutton will be done. Serve with 
carrots and mashed turnips, which may be boiled with the meat, and 
send caper-sauce to the table with it. To cook a moderate-sized leg 
of mutton of nine pounds it will take two and a quarter hours after 
the water boils ; one of twelve pounds, three hours. The liquor this 
joint was boiled in should be converted into soup. 

An Excellent Way to Cook a Breast of Mutton. — Cut the 
breast of mutton into pieces about two inches square, and let it be 
tolerably lean ; put it into a stewpan, with a little fat or butter, and 
fry it of a nice brown. Then dredge in a little flour, slice two onions, 
and put them with the herbs in the stewpan ; pour in sufficient water 
just to cover the meat, and simmer the whole gently until the mutton 
is tender. Take out the meat, strain, and skim off ail the fat from the 
gravy, and put both the meat and the gravy back into the stewpan ; 
add about a quart of young green peas, and let them boil gently until 
done ; two or three slices of bacon added and stewed with the mutton 
give additional flavor ; and, to insure the peas being a beautiful green 
color, they may be boiled in water separately, and added to the stew 
at the moment of serving. 

Broiled Mutton and Tomato Sauce. — Cut some nice slices from 
a cold leg or shoulder of mutton ; season them with pepper and salt, 
and broil over a clear fire. Make some tomato sauce, pour it over 
the mutton, and serve. This makes an excellent dish, and must be 
served very hot. 

Mutton Chop. — Broil over a quick fire, sprinkle a little salt on it 
while cooking ; turn often, and, when done, season well with butter, 
salt and pepper. 

A Plain Stew, — Take finely-chopped beef suet or other fat, and 



438 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

warm through, slice in a good many onions right across in rings, let 
them just change color in the fat; sprinkle over some flour, and add 
warm water. Place into this gravy small pieces of steak, cut thick ; 
add pepper and salt, and cover up close, to stew for twenty minutes. 
Place then over the stew as many potatoes as will be required for 
dinner, pretty well of one size, and close up again, allowing the whole 
to simmer gently till done. Do not stir at all, so that the potatoes 
remain whole. Add, the last ten minutes, two spoonfuls of sauce or 
mushroom catsup, and let simmer for that time. Turn out carefully, 
placing the potatoes, which will be whole, round the dish. This stew 
has been very successful. A good and cheap mutton stew is made 
with a piece of breast or neck of mutton by placing it in a saucepan 
with the usual gravy or warm water, and slicing over it turnips and 
carrots, also a parsnip and onion if desired. Cover this with a suet 
crust made of flour, finely chopped beef suet and warm water. Put 
the crust right over the stew, and now let simmer till done. It will 
make an excellent meal for a large family of small means. 

Irish Stew. — Take three pounds of the loin or neck of mutton, 
five pounds of potatoes, five large onions, pepper and salt to taste, 
rather more than one pint of water. Trim off some of the fat of the 
above quantity of loin or neck of mutton, and cut it into chops of a 
moderate thickness ; pare and halve the potatoes, and cut the onions 
into thick slices; put a layer of potatoes at the bottom of a stewpan, 
then a layer of mutton and onions, and season with pepper and salt ; 
proceed in this manner until the stewpan is full, taking care to have 
plenty of vegteables at the top ; pour in the water, and let it stew 
very gently for two and a half hours, keeping the lid of the stewpan 
closely shut the whole time, and occasionally shaking the prepara- 
tion to prevent its burning. 

A Nice Stew. — A pound of beef, with the addition of two or 
three potatoes, and the gravy of the last roast thickened with crumbs 
of stale bread, makes an ample stew for an ordinary-sized family. 

Potted Meats. — Cooked meats that are left over and remain on 
hand should be potted. Cut the meat from the bone, chop fine, ana 



COOKERY RECIPES. 439 

season high with salt, pepper, cloves and cinjiamon ; moisten with 
vinegar, wine, brandy, cider, or sauce or melted butter, according to 
the kind of meat or to suit your own taste. Then pack it tight into 
a stone jar and cover over the top with about quarter of an inch of 
melted butter. It will keep months; and always afford a ready and 
excellent dish for the breakfast or tea-table. 

Roast Leg of Lamb. — Let the fire be moderate, and roast the 
joint slowly, basting it frequently till done, when it should be 
sprinkled with salt, and the gravy freed from all fat before serving. 

Beef Patties. — Chop fine rare roast beef, season with pepper, 
salt and a little onion. Make a plain paste, cut into shape like an 
apple puff, fill with the mince, and bake quickly. 

Spiced Veal. — Chop three pounds of veal-steak and one thick 
slice of salt pork as fine as sausage meat ; add to it three Boston 
crackers rolled fine, half a teacup of tomato catsup, three well-beaten 
eggs, one and one-half teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, 
and one grated lemon. Mould it in the form of a loaf of bread, in a 
small dripping-pan ; cover with one rolled cracker, and baste with a 
teacupful of hot water and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Bake three 
hours, basting very often. This is an excellent dish for tea. 

Veal and Ham Sandwiches. — Sandwiches are good made of 
veal and knuckle of ham simmered a long time in a very little water, 
until perfectly tender, then freed from the bones and chopped to- 
gether. Spread the mixture like butter, add mustard, and cover with 
another piece of bread, lightly buttered, as for ordinary sandwiches. 

Veal Pie (i). — Five pounds of good veal ; cut it in small pieces ; put 
in a kettle with water to cover it ; cover close, and boil two hours. 
For crust, one and one-half cup of sour milk, one-half cup of sweet 
suet or butter ; one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of soda. But- 
ter a five-quart pan, and put in the crust. Do not roll it too thin. 
Put in your veal ; pepper and salt to taste ; pour in the water the veal 
was boiled in , a piece of butter the size of an egg ; dredge in a spoon- 
ful of flour, roll a little lard in the top crust, wet the edge of your 
under crust before putting the top on ; bake a nice brown. 



44° THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Veal Pie (2). — The following is a good recipe for English ham and 
veal pie, which was a favorite with many of Dickens' characters : " Fry 
two large veal cutlets from a leg of veal ; take half pound of ham ; cut 
the veal and ham in pieces about two inches square and place them 
in a saucepan with a quart of broth ; when nearly done pour in a 
dish and let cool ; thicken the gravy with butter and flour ; slice one 
large onion, three hard-boiled eggs ; add a little sage and chopped 
parsley, pepper and salt ; arrange meat and eggs in a dish, and pour 
gravy over ; cover pie with puff paste and ornament with fancy cut 
pieces of paste ; make a hole on top. 

Pickled Tongue. — Take a corned beef's tongue and boil until 
tender ; take off the skin ; put it in a stone basin or jar, and cover it 
with good cider-vinegar ; add a few allspice, whole peppers and cloves 
— not more than a dozen of each. 

Broiled Ham and Eggs. — Cut the ham in thin slices, take off 
the rind, wash the slices in cold water, and lay them on the gridiron 
over quick coals. Turn frequently, and they will soon be broiled. 
Take them up on a platter (previously warmed), butter and pepper 
the ham. Have ready on the fire a pan of boiling water from the 
tea-kettle; break into it as many eggs as you require for the meal, 
and, when the " white " is done, dip out each egg carefully with a 
spoon, so as to keep it whole, and set it on one of the slices of ham. 
After all are arranged, sprinkle pepper over each egg and serve. 

To Boil a Ham. — Take a ham weighing about eight or ten 
pounds, soak it for twelve or twenty-four hours in cold water, then 
cover with boiling water ; add one pint of vinegar, two or three bay 
leaves, a little bunch of thyme and parsley. The dried and sifted 
will do, or even the seed of parsley may be used if the fresh cannot 
be procured. Boil very slowly two hours and a half; skim it ; remove 
all the fat except a layer about half an inch thick ; cut off with a sharp 
knife all the black-looking outside ; put the ham into your dripping- 
pan, fat side uppermost, grate bread-crust over it, and sprinkle a 
teaspoonful of powdered sugar over it; put it in the oven for half an 
hour until it is brown. Eat cold. Cut the nicest portions into slices, 



COOKERY RECIPES. 44I 

and the ragged and little odds and ends can be chopped fine and used 

for sandwiches. Small hams are better in flavor and quality than 

large ones. A brush should be kept to scrub them with, as it is 

impossible to get them clean without it. The fat that is taken off 

is useless, save for soap-grease. In carving, cut down in thin slices 
through the middle. 

Pigs' Feet. — Wrap each pig's foot in a cotton bandage wound 
two or three times around it, and well corded with twine. Then boil 
for four hours. Let them remain in the bandages till needed to fry, 
boil or pickle. The skin will hold it together while being cooked, 
and when ready for the table they will be found tender and deli- 
cate. 

Souse. — Boil the pigs' feet until the bones £^me out easily; put 
them in a stone pot with pepper and salt, atid a few allspice, and 
cover them with good cider vinegar; they may be eaten cold, or 
dipped in flour and fried. Another way is to pick out all the bones, 
season the meat with pepper, salt and sage, and warm it up as you 
want to use it. Pigs' feet, after being boiled, are very nice cut up in 
small pieces and stewed ; make the gravy with butter, a little flour 
and water. 

Pork and Beans. — Look over the beans, and put them in soak 
the evening previous to cooking, in soft water. Parboil, and throw 
off the water twice ; prepare a piece of pork, and put it in the beans 
with the third water. Let the water boil up, skim, and boil five min- 
utes, and drain both pork and beans thoroughly. Have ready boiling 
water, put the beans and pork into the pot, with as little water as will 
cover them, simmer gently until tender. The water should all be 
evaporated when done, leaving the beans nearly dry. Taste, and if 
not sufficiently salted by the pork, season with more, but be careful 
not to get too much salt. Spread the beans evenly in a baking-dish ; 
slash the pork, and put it on a pan by itself to bake ; it should be 
handsomely browned. Stir the beans often, until within twenty min- 
utes of dinner-time, then spread them evenly, and let them brown. 
If they do not look sufficiently brown, wet them over with egg, and

brown with hot-iron, or any other manner convenient. Lay the pork 
in the middle, without the fat which dripped from it in roasting. 

POULTRY AND GAME. 

Roast Turkey.- — A good-sized turkey should be roasted two hours 
and a half, or three hours, very slowly at first. If you wish to make 
plain stuffing, pound a cracker, or crumble some bread very fine ; 
chop some raw salt pork very fine, sift some sage, savory, and mould 
them all together, seasoned with a little pepper ; an egg worked in 
makes the stuffing cut better. 

Another Way to Roast a Turkey. — Unless it is badly soiled, 
never soak, or wash a turkey, as many do. Indeed, washing in- 
jures any kind of meat and fish, except those kept in salt brine. 
Carefully draw the turkey and wipe thoroughly inside and out with 
a dry towel. It will thus keep longer uncooked, and be better flavored. 
If it chances to be a tough one, steam it an hour or two, as needed, 
before baking. If one has not a steamer large enough, as few have, 
it may be done in a wash-boiler, supporting the bird above the water 
on a couple of inverted basins, or suspending it by strings from the 
handles. Use stale bread chopped fine, just moistened with scalding 
water, not to a " mush," and add a little butter, salt, pepper, and, if 
desired, a small pinch of sweet marjoram or thyme. After stuffing 
and sewing, fasten the wings and legs down closely with skewers, or 
by tying with strings. Roast in the dripping-pan without water. To 
keep the skin from scorching, baste now and then with a little water 
seasoned with butter and salt. Bake through uniformly to a light 
brown, avoiding burning or hardening any part. A good oyster stuff- 
ing, when easily obtainable, is liked by many, as follows : Drain off 
most of the liquor from the oysters, season with sufficient butter and 
pepper, and roll them in cracker or bread crumbs. Fill the cavity 
of the turkey entirely with these. 

Boiled Turkey. — Hen-turkeys are preferable for boiling on ac- 
count of their whiteness and tenderness, and one of moderate size 
should be selected, as a large one is not suitable for boiling. Aftei 



COOKERY RECIPES. 443 

having dressed, trussed and stuffed the bird, put into sufficient boiling 
water to cover it ; let it come to a boil, then carefully remove all the 
scum. Let it simmer very gently from one and a half to two hours, 
according to size. Serve with melted-butter sauce, or with oysters. 

To Bake a Turkey. — Let the turkey be picked, singed, and washed 
and wiped dry, inside and out. Joint only to the first joints in the 
legs, and cut some of the neck off if it is all bloody; then cut one 
dozen small gashes in the fleshy parts of the turkey, on the outside 
and in different parts, and press one whole oyster in each gash ; then 
close the skin and flesh over each oyster as tightly as possible ; then 
stuff your turkey, leaving a little room for the stuffing to swell. 
When stuffed, sew it up with a stout cord, rub over lightly with flour, 
sprinkle a little salt and pepper on it, and put some in your dripping- 
pan. Put in your turkey; baste it often with its own drippings ; bake 
to a nice brown ; thicken your gravy with a little flour and water. 
Be sure and keep the bottom of the dripping-pan covered with water, 
or it will burn the gravy and make it bitter. 

Stewed Turkey. — An old turkey is more tender if stewed than 
cooked in any other way ; put in a large stew-kettle half a pound of 
bacon cut in slices, four ounces of knuckle of veal, three sprigs of 
parsley, two of thyme, a bayleaf, six small onions, one carrot cut in 
four pieces, three cloves, one clove of garlic, salt, pepper, and then 
the turkey ; add one quart of broth ; cover as nearly air-tight as pos- 
sible ; place over a moderate fire, and let it simmer — not boil — about 
two hours and a half; after this, dish the turkey ; strain the sauce 
and put it back on the fire to reduce it to jelly, which spread on the 
turkey and serve; if to be used cold, the turkey can be prepared one 
or two days in advance, and the jelly may be cut in squares and laid 
over and about the turkey. 

Chicken Pie (i). — Line the sides of a baking-dish with a good crust. 
Have your chickens cooked as for a fricassee, seasoned with salt, 
pepper and butter; before they are quite done lay them in a baking- 
dish, and pour on part of the gravy which you .have thickened with 
% little flour. Cover it then with puff-paste ; in the centre of thi» 



444 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

cover cut a small hole the size of a silver dollar, and spread a piece 
of dough twice its size over it. When baked remove this piece and 
examine the interior ; if it is getting dry, pour in more of the re- 
maining gravy ; cover it again and serve. It should be baked in a 
quick oven. 

Pigeon and veal pies are made after the above recipe. 

Chicken Pie (2). — Joint the chickens, which should be young and 
tender ; boil them in just sufficient water to cover them. When nearly 
tender take them out of the liquor and lay them in a deep pud- 
ding-dish, lined with pie-crust. To each layer of chicken put three or 
four slices of pork, add a little of the liquor in which they were boiled, 
and a couple of ounces of butter cut into small pieces ; sprinkle a 
little flour over the whole ; cover it with nice pie-crust, and ornament 
the top with some of the pastry. Bake it in a quick oven one hour. 

Chickens. — For roasting or boiling, chickens should have a dress- 
ing prepared like that for turkeys. Half a teacup of rice boiled 
with them makes them look white. 

Smothered Chicken {Southern method^. — Dress young chickens; 
wash and let them stand in water half an hour to make them white ; 
put into a baking-pan (first cutting them open at the back); sprinkle 
salt and pepper over them, and put a lump of butter here and there; 
then cover tightly with another pan the same size, and bake one 
hour ; baste often with butter. A delicious dish. 

Chicken or Fowl Patties. — Take the remains of cold roast 
chicken or fowl ; to every quarter of a pound of meat allow two 
ounces of ham, three tablespoonfuls of cream, two tablespoonfuls of 
veal gravy, one-half tablespoonful of minced lemon-peel; cayenne, 
salt and pepper to taste ; one tablespoonful of lemon-juice, one ounce 
of butter rolled in flour; puff-paste. Mince very small the white 
meat from a cold roast fowl, after removing all the skin ; weigh it, 
and to every quarter of a pound of meat allow the above proportion 
of minced ham. Put these into a stewpan with the remaining ingre- 
dients, stir over the fire for ten or fifteen minutes, taking care that the 
mixture does not burn. Roll out some puff-paste about one-quarter 



COOKERY RECIPES. , 445 

of an inch in thickness ; line the patty-pans with this, put upon each 
a small piece of bread, and cover with another layer of paste ; brush 
over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a brisk oven for about 
one-quarter of an hour. When done, cut a round piece out of the 
top, and with a small spoon take out the bread (be particular in not 
breaking the outside border of the crust), and fill the patties with the 
mixture. It will require one-quarter of an hour to prepare the meat; 
not quite fifteen minutes to bake the crust. 

Fried Chicken. — Cut up the chicken and parboil it; then season 
each piece with salt and pepper, rub with flour, and fry in hot lard. 
After the chicken is fried, make gravy in the pan, using the broth in 
which the chicken was cooked. 

Roast Goose. — If the goose be an old one, put it in a pot with 
cold water, and let it remain until the water becomes boiling hot ; 
then take it out, put an onion inside of it, but no other dressing. 
Roast it then, watching it that it does not get too much browned. 
If the gravy be too fat, as is generally the case, take off the top, 
sprinkle in a little flour, and, if you like, add a few oysters ; let it 
boil up, and serve. Onions and apple-sauce or jelly are the peculiar 
accompaniments of a goose. 

Partridge Pie. — Take three partridges, pepper and salt to taste; 
one teaspoonful of minced parsley, three-quarters of a pound of veal 
cutlet, a slice of ham, half-pint of stock, puff-paste. Line a pie-dish 
with a veal cutlet ; over that place a slice of ham and a seasoning of 
pepper and salt. Pluck, draw and wipe the partridges ; cut off the 
legs at the first joint, and season them inside with pepper, salt, minced 
parsley, and a small piece of butter ; place them in the dish, and pour 
over the stock ; line the edges of the dish with puff-paste, cover with 
the same ; brush it over with the yolk of an egg, and bake from three- 
quarters to one hour. 

Note. — Should the partridges be very large, split them in hal/ , 
they will then lie in the dish more compactly. Some cooks carve 
the partridges into joints before placing them in the dish. This 
plan is commendable on account of the ease with which the pie can 
be helped. 



446 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Pigeons on Toast. — Split some young pigeons down the back, 

vipe them, season with pepper and salt, rub with butter, sprinkle 

ightly with flour, and broil over a clear fire. Toast some neat, thin 

slices of bread, butter them quickly, and put a pigeon on each slice, 

arranging about them some sprigs of fine watercress. 

Boiled Rabbit. — For boiling, choose rabbits with smooth and 
sharp claws, as that denotes they are young ; should these be blunt 
and rugged, the ears dry and tough, the animal is old. After empty- 
ing and skinning it, wash it well in cold water, and let it soak for 
about one-quarter of an hour in warm water to draw out the blood. 
Bring the head round to the side, and fasten it there by means of a 
skewer run through that and the body. Put the rabbit into sufficient 
hot water to cover it ; let it boil very gently until tender, which will 
be in from one-half to three-quarters of an hour, according to its 
size and age. Dish it, and smother it either with onions or liver- 
sauce, or parsley and butter ; the former is, however, generally pre- 
ferred to any of the last-named sauces. When liver-sauce is preferred, 
the liver should be boiled for a few minutes and minced very finely, 
or rubbed through a sieve before it is added to the sauce. A very 
young rabbit will require to be cooked one-half hour ; a large one 
three-quarters of an hour; an old one one hour or longer. 

Stewed Rabbit. — Cut a rabbit into small joints ; put them into a 
stewpan; add two large onions, sliced, six cloves, and one small tea- 
spoonful of chopped lemon-peel. Pour in sufficient water to cover 
the meat, and, when the rabbit is nearly done, drop in a few force- 
meat balls, to which has been added the liver, finely chopped. Thicken 
the gravy with flour and butter, put in a large tablespoonful of tomato 
or any preferred catsup ; give one boil and serve. 

A Delicious Stuffing for any fowl, but especially for the delicately 
flavored chicken, or any of the small fowls, is made by taking about 
two dozen oysters ; chop them very fine, and mix them with two cups 
of fine bread crumbs, or powdered crackers. A full ounce of butter is 
required. A tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a little grated lemon 
peel, plenty of salt and black pepper, and a suspicion of cayenne pep- 



COOKERY RECIPES. 447 

per; mix these thoroughly; that is half the secret of success in 
cooking, to have the ingredients which compose a dish so blended 
that it is impossible to tell precisely of what it is composed. This 
stuffing should be moistened with a little of the oyster liquor, and 
the beaten yolk of one egg. 

SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

The preparation and appearances of sauces and gravies are of the 
highest consequence, and in nothing does the talent and taste of 
the cook more display itself Their special adaptability to the various 
viands they are to accompany cannot be too much studied in order 
that they may harmonize and blend with them as perfectly, so to 
speak, as does a pianoforte accompaniment with the voice of the 
singer. 

Brown sauces, generally speaking, should scarcely be so thick as 
white sauces; and it is well to bear in mind that all those which are 
intended to mask the various dishes of poultry or meat should be of 
a sufficient consistency to slightly adhere to the fowls or joints over 
which they are poured. For browning and thickening sauces, etc., 
browned flour may be properly employed. 

Sauces should possess a decided character, and whether sharp or 
sweet, savory or plain, they should carry out their names in a distinct 
manner, although, of course, not so much flavored as to make them 
too piquant on the one hand, or too mawkish on the other. 

Gravies and sauces should be sent to table very hot, and there is 
all the more necessity for the cook to see to this point, as, from 
their being usually served in small quantities, they are more liable 
to cool quickly than if they were in a larger bo.dy. Those sauces 
of which cream or eggs form a component part should be well stirred 
as soon as these ingredients are added to them, and must never be 
allowed to boil, as in that case they would instantly curdle. 

Brown Apple Sauce. — Use six good-sized apples, one-half pint of 
brown gravy, cayenne to taste. Put the gravy in a stewpan, and add 
the apples, after having pared, cored and quartered them. Let 



44^ THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

them simmer gently till tender ; beat them to a pulp, and season with 
cayenne. 

Bread Sauce [to serve with roast turkey, fowl, game, etc) — Gib- 
lets of poultry, three-quarters of a pound of the crumbs of a stale 
loaf, one onion, twelve whole peppers, one blade of mace, salt to taste, 
two tablespoonfuls of cream or melted butter, one pint of water. 
Put the giblets, vijith the head, neck, legs, etc., into a saucepan; add 
the onion, pepper, mace, salt, and rather more than one pint of water. 
Let this simmer for an hour; then strain the liquor over the bread, 
which should be previously grated or broken into small pieces. Cover 
up the saucepan, and leave it for an hour by the side of the fire; then 
beat the sauce up with a fork until no lumps remain and the who! e 
is nice and smooth. Let it boil for three or four minutes; kee\D 
stirring it until it is rather thick, then add three tablespoonfuls of 
good melted butter or cream, and serve very hot. Time — Two hours 
and a quarter. 

Browning for Gravies and Sauces. — The browning for soups 
answers equally well for sauces and gravies, when it is absolutely 
necessary to color them in this manner ; but where they can be made 
to look brown by using catsup, wine, browned flour, tomatoes, or 
any color sauce, it is far preferable. As, however, in cooking, so 
much depends upon appearance, perhaps it would be as well for the 
inexperienced cook to use the artificial means. When no browning 
is at hand, and you wish to heighten the color of your gravy, dis- 
solve a lump of sugar in an iron spoon over a sharp fire ; when it is 
in a liquid state, drop it in the sauce or gravy quite hot. Care, how- 
ever, must be taken not to put in too much, as it would impart a 
disagreeable flavor. 

Clarified Butter. — Put the butter in a basin before the fire, and 
when it melts stir it round once or twice, and let it settle. Do not 
strain it unless absolutely necessary, as it causes so much waste. 
Pour it gently off into a clean, dry jar, carefully leaving all sediment 
behind. Let it cool, and carefully exclude the air by means of a 
bladder, or wash-leather, tied over. If the butter is salt, it may be 
washed before melting, when it is to be used for sweet dishes. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 449 

Melted Butter (economical'). — Two ounces of butter, one dessert- 
spoonful of flour, salt to taste, half-pint of water. Mix the flour and 
water to a smooth batter, which put into a saucepan. Add the butter 
and a seasoning of salt ; keep stirring one way till all the ingredients 
are melted and perfectly smooth ; let the whole boil for a minute or 
two, and serve. Simmer two minutes. 

Caper Sauce for Fish. — Half-pint of melted butter, three dessert- 
spoonfuls of capers, one dessertspoonful of their liquor, a small 
piece of glaze, if at hand (this may be dispensed with), one-quarter 
teaspoonful of salt, ditto of pepper, one tablespoonful of anchovy 
essence. Cut the capiers across once or twice, but do not chop them 
fine ; put them in a saucepan with a half-pint of good melted butter, 
and add all the other ingredients. Keep stirring the whole until it 
just simmers, when it is ready to serve. 

Gravy for Roast Beef. — Melt a little salt in a gill of water ; pour 
it over a roast when put in the oven ; place under it an earthen dish 
to catch the drippings. Baste often for half an hour, then set it to 
cool. When cool remove all fat, heat the gravy and pour it over 
the roast. 

Gravy for Steak. — Put in a platter for two slices of steak a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, cut in small pieces. Add a little salt, 
a dust of pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of hot water. Do not let it 
boil, but just melt and keep warm. 

Cheap Gravy for Minced Meat. — Bones and trimmings of cold 
roast or boiled veal, one pint and a half of water, one onion, quarter 
of a teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
salt, one blade of pounded mace, the juice of quarter of a lemon, 
thickening of butter and flour. Put all the ingredients into a stew- 
pan, except the thickening and lemon-juice, and let them simmer very 
gently for an hour. 

Gravy for Venison. — Trimmings of venison, three or four mutton 
shank-bones, salt to taste, one pint of water, two teaspoonfuls of 
walnut-catsup. Brown the trimmings over a nice, clear fire, and put 
them in the stewpan with the shank-bones and water; simmer gently 



450 THE hearthstone; or, liEe at home. 

for two hours, strain and skim, and add the walnut-catsup and a 
seasoning of salt. Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve. Cook 
two hours. 

Substitute for Caper Sauce. — Half a pint of melted butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of cut parsley, half a teaspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful of vinegar. Boil the parsley slowly to let it become a good 
color ; cut, but do not chop it fine. Add to it a half-pint of smoothly- 
made melted butter, with salt and vinegar in the above proportions. 
Let it simmer two minutes, and then serve. 

Celery Sauce {for boiled turkey, poultry, etc.) — Six heads of 
celery, one pint of white stock, two blades of mace, one small bunch 
of savory herbs ; thickening of butter and flour, or arrowroot, half a 
pint of cream, lemon-juice. Boil the celery in salt and water till ten- 
der, and cut into pieces two inches long. Put the stock into a stew- 
pan with the mace and herbs, and let it simmer for one-half hour to 
extract their flavor. Then strain the liquor, add the celery and a 
thickening of butter kneaded with flour, or, what is still better, with 
arrowroot; just before serving, put in the cream, boil it up and 
squeeze in a little lemon-juice. If necessary, add a seasoning of salt 
and white pepper. 

Celery Sauce. — Take four heads of celery, wash and boil it in 
salt and water till tender, and cut into pieces two inches long ; use 
half a pint of melted butter made with a little milk, and put in the 
celery, pounded mace and seasoning. Simmer for three minutes, 
when the sauce will be ready to serve. It will require twenty-five 
minutes to boil the celery. 

Tomato Sauce for Keeping. — To every quart of tomato pulp 
allow one pint of cayenne vinegar, three-quarters of an ounce of 
shallots, three-quarters of an ounce of garlic, peeled and cut in slices; 
salt to taste. To every six quarts of liquor, one pint of soy, one pint 
of anchovy sauce. Gather the tomatoes quite ripe ; bake them in a 
slow oven till tender ; rub them through a sieve, and to every quart 
of pulp add cayenne vinegar, garlic, shallots and salt, in the above 
proportion. Boil the whole together till the garlic and shallots are 



COOKERY RECIPES. 45 I 

quite soft ; then rub it through a sieve, put it again into a saucepan, 
and to every six quarts of the Hquor add one pint of soy, and the 
same quantity of anchovy sauce, and boil all together for about twenty 
minutes ; bottle off for use, and carefully seal or resin the corks. This 
will keep good for two or three years, but will be fit for use in a 
week. A useful and less expensive sauce may be made by omitting 
the anchovy and soy. Time, altogether, one hour. 

Pepper Sauce. — One head of cabbage, twenty-five green peppers 
and a small measure of onions. Chop fine. Add one-half pound of 
mustard-seed and a handful of salt ; put it in a stone pot, with vinegar 
enough to- wet it thoroughly. 

Chow-chow. — Four quarts chopped tomatoes, one quart chopped 
onions, one pint chopped peppers, half-cup white mustard-seed, half- 
cup salt. Mix and cover with cold vinegar, then add sugar and curry 
powder to taste. 

To Preserve Parsley through the Winter. — Use freshly- 
gathered parsley for keeping, and wash it perfectly free from grit and 
dirt; put it into boiling water which has been slightly salted and well 
skimmed, and then let it boil for two or three minutes ; take it out, 
let it drain and lay it on a sieve in front of the fire, when it should be 
dried as expeditiously as possible. Store it away in a very dry place 
in bottles, and when wanted for use, pour over it a little warm water, 
and let it stand for about five minutes. 

Keeping Sweet Cider. — Heat the cider until it boils, pour into 
bottles, which have been previously heated to prevent cracking. Cork 
tight, and seal immediately, as in canning fruit. The cider will keep 
unchanged for years. 

Home-made Vinegar. — To one pint of strained honey add two 
gallons of soft water. Let it stand in a moderately warm place ; in 
three weeks it will be excellent vinegar. 

Cheap Vinegar. — Take a quantity of common Irish potatoes, 
wash them until they are thoroughly clean, place them in a large 
vessel, and boil until done. Drain off carefully the water they were 
cooked in, straining it, if necessary, in order to remove every particle 



452 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

of the potato. Then put this potato-water in a jug or keg, which set 
near the stove, or in some place where it will be kept warm, and add 
one pound of sugar to about two gallons and a half of the water, 
some hop yeast, or a small portion of whiskey. Let it stand three or 
four weeks and you will have excellent vinegar, at the cost of six or 
seven cents per gallon. 

Spiced Tomatoes. — CKie peck of tomatoes, three pounds of brown 
sugar; boil four or five hours. One hour before taking from the fire, 
add one pint of vinegar and a handful of spices, consisting of un- 
ground cinnamon, cloves and mace. 

Spiced Sweetmeats. — Ten pounds of fruit, six pounds of brown 
sugar, one ounce of ground cloves, one ounce of allspice, one ounce 
of cinnamon, a little mace. 

Hot Spice [a delicious adjunct to chops, steaks, gravies, etc?) — 
Three drams each of ginger, black pepper and cinnamon, seven 
cloves, half an ounce of mace, quarter of an ounce of cayenne, one 
ounce of grated nutmeg, an ounce and a half of white pepper. Pound 
the ingredients and mix them thoroughly together, taking care that 
everything is well blended. Put the spice in a very dry glass bottle 
for use. The quantity of cayenne may be increased should the above 
not be enough to suit the palate. 

Crab Sauce for Fish [equal to Lobster Sauce). — Choose a nice 
fresh crab, pick all the meat away from the shell, and cut it into 
small square pieces. Make half a pint of melted butter, and put it 
in the fish and seasoning ; let it gradually warm through, and sim- 
mer for two minutes. It should not boil. 

Cucumber Vinegar (a very nice addition to salads). — Use ten 
large cucumbers or twelve small ones, one quart of vinegar, two 
onions, two shallots, one tablespoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls 
of pepper, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of cayenne. Pare and slice 
the cucumbers, put them in a stone jar or open-mouthed bottle 
with the vinegar; slice the onions and shallots, and add them, with 
all the other ingredients, to the cucumbers. Let it stand four or 
five days, boil it all up, and when cold strain the liquor through a 



COOKERY RECIPES. 453 

piece of muslin, and store it away in small bottles well sealed. This 
vinegar is a very nice addition to gravie^, hashes, etc., as well as a 
great improvement to salads, or to eat with cold meat. 

Caramel for Coloring. — Half a pound of brown sugar, one table- 
spoonful of water put into a frying-pan, and stir steadily over the fire 
till it becomes a deep, dark brown in color ; then add one cup of 
boiling water and one teaspoonful of salt ; boil a minute longer, bottle 
and keep corked. One tablespoonful will color a clear soup, and it 
can be used for jellies, gravies and sauces. 

VEGETABLES. 

Miss Corson's Rules for Vegetables. — There is no better 
authority than Miss Corson on cooking, and her method for pre- 
paring vegetables is as follows : Spinach is an excellent dish when 
well cooked ; take two quarts, wash, boil for two minutes in salted 
boiling water, drain, chop and heat in a frying-pan for two minutes 
with an ounce each of butter and flour ; half a pint of meat broth is 
added, the compound is stirred and heated for five minutes, and served 
with small pieces of fried bread. Second only to spinach are beet- 
sprouts, which will soon put forth their tender claims for considera- 
tion ; we all know them boiled, but after they are boiled they gain in 
flavor by being fried for two or three minutes in butter. New cab- 
bage scalded five minutes in fast-boiling water, coarsely chopped, 
sprinkled with flour, salt and pepper, and gently stewed for five min- 
utes with milk or cream enough to cover it, is good. So, too, is red 
cabbage sliced, thrown for fifteen minutes into scalding salted water 
and vinegar, then drained, and fried five minutes with butter, and 
served with a little hot meat gravy. Lettuce, which seems devoted 
to " salad days," is excellent stuffed ; it is well washed in salted cold 
water, the roots trimmed off, two tablespoonfuls of cooked force-meat 
of any kind, or chopped cold meat highly seasoned, inclosed within 
the leaves which are bound together with tape or strips of cloth ; 
several heads thus prepared are placed in a saucepan, covered with 
broth or cold gravy well seasoned, and set over the fire to simmer 



454 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

about five minutes; the tapes are then removed and the lettuce heads 
and sauce are served hot. A hnk between cabbage and lettuce are 
Brussels sprouts, those tender, baby cabbages, which, stewed in 
cream, or quickly fried in butter, almost incline one's thoughts to 
vegetarianism. 

Beets are familiar enough boiled and sliced, either served hot with 
butter, pepper and salt, or pickled, but a novelty is a beet pudding, 
made by mixing a pint of cooked sugar-beets, chopped, with four 
eggs, a quart of milk, a little salt and pepper, a tablespoonful of butter, 
and baking them about half an hour ; cold boiled beets sliced and 
fried with butter are palatable ; to cook them so that none of their 
color shall be lost, carefully wash them without breaking the skin or 
cutting off the roots or stalks, and boil them until tender, about an 
hour, in boiling salted water. 

Turnips, either white or yellow, stewed in gravy, are excellent. 
Choose a quart of small, even size ; peel them ; boil them fifteen min- 
utes in well-salted boiling water; drain them ; put them into a frying- 
pan with sufficient butter to prevent burning ; brown them ; stir in a 
tablespoonful of flour; cover them with hot water; add a palatable 
seasoning of salt and pepper, and stew them gently until tender. Or 
peel and cut them in small, regular pieces ; brown them over the fire 
with a little butter and a slight sprinkling of sugar; add salt and 
pepper, and boiling water enough to cover them, and gently stew them 
until tender; serve them hot. 

Parsnips are not sufficiently appreciated, perhaps because of their 
too sweet taste ; but this can be overcome to a palatable extent by 
judicious cookery ; they are excellent when sliced, after boiling and 
warmed in a sauce made by mixing flour, butter and milk over the 
fire and seasoning it with salt and pepper ; as soon as warm they are 
served with a little chopped parsley and a squeeze of lemon-juice. 
For parsnips fried brown in an old-fashioned iron pot with slices of 
salt pork and a seasoning of salt and pepper, several good words 
might be said. 

Carrots boiled and mashed and warmed with butter, pepper and, 



COOKERY RECIPES. 455 

salt deserve to be known ; or sliced and quickly browned in butter ; 
or tossed for five minutes over the fire with chopped onion, parsley, 
butter, seasonings and sufficient gravy to moisten them ; or boiled, 
quartered, heated with cream, seasoned, and, at the moment of serv- 
ing, thickened with the yolk of eggs. 

Onions are capital when sliced and quickly fried in plenty of smok- 
ing hot fat, or roasted whole until tender, and served with butter, 
pepper and salt ; or chosen while still small, carefully peeled without 
breaking, browned in butter, and then simmered tender with just boil- 
ing water enough to cover them ; or boiled tender in broth and then 
heated five minutes in nicely-seasoned cream. 

Oyster-plant, scraped under cold water, boiled tender in salted 
water containing a trace of vinegar, and then heated with a little 
highly-seasoned melted butter, is excellent ; the tender leaves which 
it often bears make a nice salad. Somewhat like oyster-plant are 
Jerusalem artichokes and like oyster-plant, they must be peeled 
under water, boiled tender, and then served with melted butter, or 
quickly browned in butter, either plain or with chopped herbs, or 
served with an acid sauce of any kind. 

Celery we know best in its uncooked state, but it is very good 
stewed in any brown or white gravy or sauce, or rolled in fritter batter 
and fried brown. 

Squash and pumpkin are very good either boiled, sliced, and 
broiled or fried, or made into fritters like oyster-plant. 

Potatoes, most important of all hardy vegetables, must close the 
list. Lives there a cook with soul so dead as not to be willing to 
expend all the powers of fire, water and salt to produce mealy pota- 
toes ? If so, the writing of her epitaph would be a cheerful task. 
And if cold ones are left they can rehabilitate themselves in favor by 
appearing chopped, moistened with white sauce or cream, and either 
fried in butter or baked quickly, with a covering of bread-crumbs. 
Steam-fried, that is sliced raw, put into a covered pan over the fire, 
with butter and seasoning, and kept covered until tender, with only 
enough stirring to prevent burning, they are capital. To fry them 



456 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Lyonnaise style, they are cooled in their jackets to keep them whole, 
sliced about a quarter of an inch thick, browned in butter with a 
little sliced onion, sprinkled with chopped parsley, pepper and salt, 
and served hot. Larded, they have bits of fat ham or bacon inserted 
in them, and are baked tender. Note well that the more expeditiously 
a baked potato is cooked and eaten the better it will be. 

Time-Table for Boiling. — The time for boiling green vegetables 
depends much upon the age and time they have been gathered. The 
younger and more freshly gathered, the more quickly they are 
cooked. 

Below is a very good time-table for amateur cooks. 

Potatoes boiled, thirty minutes. 

Potatoes baked, forty-five minutes. 

Sweet potatoes boiled, fifty minutes. 

Sweet potatoes baked, sixty minutes. 

Squash boiled, twenty-five minutes. 

Green peas boiled, twenty to forty minutes. 

Shelled beans boiled, sixty minutes. 

String-beans boiled, one to two hours. 

Green corn, thirty to sixty minutes. 

Asparagus, fifteen to thirty minutes. 

Spinach, one to two hours. 

Tomatoes, fresh, one hour. 

Tomatoes, canned, thirty minutes. 

Cabbage, forty-five minutes to two hours. 

Cauliflower, one or two hours. 

Dandelions, two or three hours. 
Vegetables judiciously used are healthful. Beans and peas are 
preferable to potatoes, as they contain four times as much nutritive 
matter. Potatoes that are pared before they are boiled are nearly all 
starch, and produce fat. 

Tomatoes. — The tomato is so valuable a vegetable that it is well 
worth knowing how to keep them. If they are picked when just ripe 
and with a portion of the stems retained, and at once covered with a 



COOKERY RECIPES. 457 

brine composed of a teacup of salt dissolved in a gallon of water, 
they can be kept nearly all the year without noticeable loss of their 
freshness of taste. 

Tomatoes, if very ripe, will skin easily ; if not, pour scalding water 
on them and let them remain in it four or five minutes. Peel and 
put them in a stewpan, with a tablespoonful of water, if not very 
juicy; if so, no water will be required. Put in a little salt and stew 
them for half an hour ; then turn them into a deep dish with buttered 
toast. Another way of cooking them, which is considered very nice 
by epicures, is to put them in a deep dish with fine bread-crumbs, 
crackers pounded fine, a layer of each alternately; put small bits 
of butter, a little salt and pepper on each layer ; some cooks add a 
little nutmeg and sugar. Have a layer of bread-crumbs on the top. 
Bake it three-quarters of an hour. 

To Broil Tomatoes. — Cut off the green part of the stem and place 
the tomatoes on a gridiron over hot coals, and cover with a pan or 
lid. They are to be cooked slowly. When done, take up, dress very 
liberally with butter, salt, and pepper. 

To Can Tomatoes. — Wash clean, drain dry, or wipe ; place them 
in a colander, pour boiling water over them ; peel, cut off all the 
green part and stew until they are perfectly heated through. If you 
use tin cans make thin, long rolls of putty; fill the cans, put on the 
lids, lay the rolls of putty in the grooves and smooth them with a 
knife. Canned fruit should always be kept in a cool, dry place — not 
in a cellar. 

To Boil Green Corn. — Trim off all the husks, and put the ears 
into boiling water, with a tablespoonful of salt to a dozen ears. If 
the fire is brisk, tender corn will be done in fifteen minutes, other- 
wise in half an hour. Lay a napkin on a large dish, and afl:er drain- 
ing off the water from the corn, lay it on, turning the corners of 
the napkin over it to keep it warm. 

Sweet Corn. — Corn is much sweeter to be boiled on the cob. If 

made into succotash, cut it from the cobs, and boil it with Lima beans 

and a few slices of salt pork. It requires boiling from fifteen to thirty 

minutes, according to its a^gfe.

To Cook Egg-plant {Mrs. Taylo/s recipe). — Peel it, cut it in slices 
about half an inch thick ; spread salt over each slice, putting one 
slice on top of each other ; let it lie two hours, then wash the salt off 
of it in cold water, dry it with a towel. Beat two or three eggs, 
dip the egg-plant in the egg, then dip each slice in rolled cracker ; 
have a round pot with boiling hot lard in it, and drop in the slices 
of egg-plant — just as you would fry doughnuts. 

Egg-plant. — Cut the egg-plant in slices an inch thick, and let it 
lie for several hours in salted water to remove the bitter taste. To 
fry it, put the slices in the frying-pan with a small quantity of butter, 
and turn them when one side is done. Be sure that they are 
thoroughly cooked. Stuffed egg-plant is sometimes preferred to fried. 
Peel the plant whole, cut it in two, and let it lie in salted water. 
Then scoop out the inside of the plant, chop it up fine, mixing 
crumbs of bread, salt and butter with it ; fry it, return it to the hoi- , 
low egg-plant, join the cut pieces together, and let them bake a while 
in the oven. 

Baked Egg-plant. — Boil them whole ten minutes ; then cut them 
in half, and take out the seed. Make a stuffing of bread, butter, pep- 
per, salt and one egg ; close them, tie them with a string, put water 
in the pan, let them cook slowly half an hour, basting them with 
butter; thicken the gravy, and put it over them on the dish. 

Succotash. — Take small white beans, soak them twelve hours, and 
then put them on to boil. When half done, add the corn, and let 
them boil until soft, when add butter, salt and pepper. 

Corn Fritters.— One teacup of milk, three eggs, one pint of green 
corn grated, a little salt, and as much flour as will form a batter; 
beat the eggs, yolks and whites separately; to the yolks of the eggs 
add the corn, flour and milk, and add enough to make the batter of 
the right stiffness; if the first quantity is not sufficient, beat the whole 
hard, and then stir in the whites ; a teaspoonful of baking powder 
will improve it ; drop the batter, a spoonful at a time, into hot lard, 
and fry on both sides a light brown. They can be fried as griddle- 
cakes with less lard or grease. They can be eaten warm or hot, 



COOKERY RECIPES. 459 

with butter for sauce ; a less number of eggs can be used if they 
are scarce. 

Asparagus (i). — Great attention is necessary to boil asparagus; it 
must be carefully washed and cleaned, the horny part must be cut 
away, leaving only enough to take it up with the fingers. After th« 
white horny part has been well scraped, cut the mall off at one length, 
and tie them up in separate bundles; lay them in boiling water, 
with a little salt. Boil them briskly, and they are done enough when 
tender. Dip a round of toasted bread in the liquor, and lay it in 
the dish ; then pour some melted butter over the toast, and lay the 
asparagus on the toast entirely round the dish. Serve with melted 
butter in a sauce-tureen. 

Asparagus (2). — Wash the asparagus, tie the stalks of the same 
size together, and put them on to boil in hot water, in which a little 
salt has been sprinkled. They will cook in about fifteen minutes. 
When soft, take them up carefully into the dish in which they will 
be served ; cut the strings, and draw them out so as not to break the 
asparagus. Butter, salt and pepper it. 

Macaroni. — Boil the macaroni in water enough to cover it 
until it is tender, then drain off the water. Put a layer of macaroni 
in a dish, then a layer of grated cheese, three layers of macaroni and 
two of cheese ; for the top beat the yolks of two eggs with a little 
milk, and pour over the macaroni ; bake until nicely browned. 

There are many ways of cooking macaroni besides the above way 
of boiling it in water and baking it afterward with grated cheese, 
bread-crumbs, butter and seasoning of salt and pepper. This is very 
nice, but if the cheese chosen was always Parmesan it would be 
much more palatable. 

The Italians cook macaroni and serve it with a tomato sauce 
which is very excellent, and is sold now in Italian groceries in cans, 
already prepared to pour over the boiled macaroni. Macaroni 
stewed in milk is a good and wholesome dish for children, especially 
in summer. 

An excellent way to serve macaroni is the following : Fill a china 



46o THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

baking-dish with alternate layers of oysters and boiled macaroni; 
season each layer with salt, pepper and butter. When the dish is 
full cover with cracker-crumbs. Pour over all a cup of oyster juice, 
and bake in a quick oven till brown. 

Macaroni and kidneys are thus prepared : Scald two veal kidneys 
which have been skinned and freed from fat ; cut them in slices and 
fry brown ; then place them in a baking-dish, season with salt and 
pepper, cover them with macaroni and cracker-crumbs, and pour 
over the whole a gravy made with tomatoes. Bake in a quick oven 
till brown. Vermicelli and Italian paste should always be boiled 
separately, and added to the soup just before it is served. 

How TO Peel Onions. — In peehng onions put a large needle in 
the mouth, half in and half out. The needle attracts the juice of the 
bulb, and any number may be peeled without affecting the eyes. 

Cauliflower should be wrapped in cloth when boiled ; serve with 
melted butter. 

Fried Oyster-plant. — Scrape the roots as you would parsnips ; 
boil them tender ; then mash them, and add an egg and some rolled 
soda-cracker. Make into, cakes and fry in butter. Serve hot. 

To Cook Hominy. — Corn hulled by machinery, leaving the grain 
nearly whole, makes the best hominy, and in the Southern States it 
is as much the standard breakfast and dinner dish as potatoes are in 
the North, and it is far more nutritive and wholesome. It is cooked 
as follows : Put your hominy in soak over-night in tepid water. Boil 
it gently in a porcelain or tinned kettle at least two hours, in the 
same water, adding more if necessary, and taking care not to let it 
scorch, and that the water is absorbed when taken off Keep it in the 
same vessel, warming it over from time to time until consumed. 
Neither salt nor butter should be added while cooking. 

Parsnips. — Wash the parsnips, scrape them thoroughly, and, with 
the point of the knife, remove any black specks about them j and, 
should they be very large, cut the thick part into quarters. Put them 
into a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the proportion of one tea- 
spoonful of salt to half a gallon of water. Boil them rapidly until 



COOKERY RECIPES. 4^1 

tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork into them; take 
them up, drain them, and serve in a vegetable dish. This vegetable 
is usually served with salt fish, boiled pork, or boiled beef; when 
sent to table with the latter, a few should be placed alternately with 
carrots round the dish as a garnish. Cook large parsnips, one to one 
hour and a half; small ones, one-half to one hour. 

Boiled Green Peas. — To each half-gallon of water allow one 
small teaspoonful of moist sugar, one heaped tablespoonful of salt. 
This delicious vegetable, to be eaten in perfection, should be young, 
and not gathered or shelled long before it is dressed. Shell the peas, 
wash them well in cold water, and drain them ; then put them into a 
saucepan with plenty of fast-boiling water, to which salt and moist 
sugar have been added in the above proportion ; let them boil quickly 
over a brisk fire, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and be care- 
ful that the smoke does not draw in. When tender, pour them into 
a colander ; put them into a hot vegetable-dish, and quite in the centre 
of the peas place a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Many cooks 
boil a small bunch of mint with the peas, or garnish them with it, by 
boiling a few sprigs in a saucepan by themselves. Should the peas 
be very old, and difficult to boil a good color, a very tiny piece of 
soda may be thrown in the water previous to putting them in ; but 
this must be very sparingly used, as it causes the peas, when boiled, 
to have a mashed and broken appearance. With young peas there 
is not the slightest occasion to use it. Cook young peas ten to fifteen 
minutes ; the large sorts, such as marrowfats, etc., eighteen to twenty- 
four minutes ; old peas, half an hour. 

To Dress Salsify. — To each half-gallon of water allow one heaped 
tablespoonful of salt, one ounce of butter, two tablespoonfuls of 
lemon-juice. Scrape the roots gently, so as to strip them only of 
their outside peel ; cut them into pieces about four inches long, and, 
as they are peeled, throw them into water with which has been 
mixed a little lemon-j nice, to prevent their discoloring. Then put them 
into boiling water, with salt, butter and lemon-juice in the above pro- 
portion, and let them boil rapidly until tender ; try them with a fork, 



462 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

and when it penetrates easily they are done. Drain the salsify, and 
serve with good white sauce, or French -melted butter. Cook thirty 
to fifty minutes. 

Note. — This vegetable may be also boiled, sliced, and fried in a 
batter of nice brown. When crisp and a good color, it should be 
served with fried parsley in the centre of the dish, and a little fine salt 
sprinkled over the salsify. 

Boiled Cabbage. — To each half-gallon of water allow one heaped 
tablespoonful of salt, a very small piece of soda. Pick off all the 
dead outside leaves, cut off as much of the stalk as possible, and cut 
the cabbages twice across the stalk end ; if they should be very large, 
quarter them. Wash them well in cold water, place them in a 
colander, and drain ; then put them into plenty of fast-boiling water, 
to which have been added salt and soda in the above proportions. 
Stir them down once or twice in the water, keep the pan uncovered, 
and let them boil quickly until tender. The instant they are done 
take them up into a colander, place a plate over them, let them 
thoroughly drain, dish and serve. Cook large cabbages, or Savoys, 
one-half to three-quarters of an hour; young summer cabbage, ten 
to twelve minutes, after the water boils. 

Boiled Carrots. — To each half-gallon of water allow one heaped 
tablespoonful of salt. Cut off the green tops, wash and scrape the 
carrots, and, should there be any black specks, remove them. If very 
large, cut them in halves, divide them lengthwise into four pieces, 
and put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion ; let 
them boil until tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork 
into them ; dish, and serve very hot. This vegetable is an indispen- 
sable accompaniment to boiled beef When thus served it is usually 
boiled with the beef A few carrots are placed round the dish as a 
garnish, and the remainder sent to table in a vegetable-dish. Young 
carrots do not require nearly so much boiling, nor should they be 
divided. These make a nice addition to stewed veal, etc. Large 
carrots should cook one hour and three-quarters to two hours and 
a quarter; young ones, about half an hour. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 463 

White Beans. — Beans are deliciously prepared, without grease of 
any kind, as follows : Boil slowly in soft water, in a covered vessel, two 
or three hours, or until the beans begin to fall to pieces, and the 
water (which should barely fill the beans when done, and not stand 
above them) is viscid and jelly-like. Add a very little salt, and 
nothing else, unless you have chosen at the proper time to put in a 
few pared potatoes to eat with them. 

Lima Beans. — They should be gathered young. Shell them, lay 
them in a pan of cold water, and then boil them about two hours, 
till they are quite soft. Drain them well, and add to them some 
butter. 

Note. — Never use strong or rancid butter in seasoning vegetables. 

Chartreuse of Vegetables. — Line a plain mould or a two-quart 
tin basin with very thin slices of raw bacon ; have prepared some 
half-boiled string-beans, carrots and turnips. Cut the latter into small 
slices, and scatter them all around the edges and bottom of the pan, 
about an inch thick ; fill up the middle with some chopped veal, or 
with mixed chopped potatoes and cabbage, or cauliflower. Put a 
plate over the top of the mould, tie a cloth over that, and put it into a 
steamer for an hour and a half. Turn out upon a platter, and serve 
with cream or white sauce. 

To Cook Greens. — This is the simplest of dishes, and yet it is 
not always a well-served one. Greens should be properly boiled ; 
the water should be soft, and a tablespoonful of salt added to a large- 
sized pot of it, which should be boiling hot when the greens are 
thrown in. It should be kept boiling until they are done, which can 
be told by their sinking to the bottom of the pot, and then they 
should be skimmed out as quickly as possible into a colander, so that 
all the water will run out. Press them with a small plate, then turn 
upon a platter; add a larjje piece of butter, and cut up fine. Serve 
smoking hot. 

To Boil Potatoes.— ^Ten or twelve potatoes ; to each half-gallon 
of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt. Choose potatoes 
of an equal size, pare them, take out all the eyes and specks, and, as 



464 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

they are peeled, throw them into cold water. Put them into a sauce- 
pan, with sufficient cold water to cover them, with salt in the above 
proportion, and let them boil gently until tender. Ascertain when 
they are done by thrusting a fork in them, and take them up the 
moment they feel soft through ; for if they are left in the water after- 
ward, they become waxy or watery. Drain away the water ; put the 
saucepan by the side of the fire with the lid partially uncovered, to 
allow the steam to escape, and let the potatoes get thoroughly dry, 
and do not allow them to get burnt. Their superfluous moisture 
will evaporate, and the potatoes, if a good sort, should be perfectly 
mealy and dry. Potatoes vary so much in quality and size that it is 
difficult to give the exact time for boiling; they should be attentively 
watched, and probed with a fork to ascertain when they are cooked. 
Send them to table quickly, and very hot, with an opening in the 
cover of the dish, that a portion of the steam may evaporate, and not 
fall back on the potatoes. Moderate-sized old potatoes will cook in 
fifteen to twenty minutes after the water boils; large ones, half an 
hour to thirty-five minutes. 

Note. — To keep potatoes hot after draining the water from them, 
put a folded cloth or flannel (kept for the purpose) on the top of them, 
keeping the saucepan-lid partially uncovered. This will absorb the 
moisture, and keep them hot some time without spoiling. 

How TO USE Cold Potatoes.— -To every pound of cold potatoes 
allow two tablespoonfuls of flour, two ditto of minced onions, one 
ounce of butter, milk. Mash the potatoes with a fork until perfectly 
free from lumps ; stir in the other ingredients, and add sufficient milk 
to moisten them well; press the potatoes in a mould, and bake in a 
moderate oven until nicely browned, which will be in from twenty 
minutes to half an hour. Turn them out of the mould, and serve. 
Cook twenty minutes to half an hour. 

Fried Potatoes {French fashion). — Potatoes, hot butter or clarified 
dripping, salt. Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices, as nearly 
the same size as possible ; make some butter or dripping quite hot in 
a frying-pan ; put in the potatoes and fry them on both sides of a nice 



COOKERY RECIPES. 465 

brown. When they are crisp and done, take them up, place them 
on a cloth before the fire to drain . the grease from them, and serve 
very hot, after sprinkling them with salt. These are delicious with 
rumpsteak, and, in France, are frequently served thus as a breakfast 
dish. The remains of cold potatoes may also be sliced and fried by 
the above recipe, but the slices must be cut a little thicker. Sliced 
raw potatoes should fry five minutes. 

Baked Potatoes. — Choose large potatoes, as much of a size as 
possible ; wash them in lukewarm water, and scrub them well, for 
the browned skin of a baked potato is by many persons considered 
the better part of it. Put them into a moderate oven, and bake 
them for about two hours, turning them three or four times whilst 
they are cooking. Serve them in a napkin immediately they are 
done, as if kept a long time in the oven they have a shrivelled ap- 
pearance. Do not forget to send to table with them a piece of cold 
butter. 

Large potatoes will require to be cooked in a hot oven one and 
a half hour to two hours ; in a cool oven, two to two and one-half 
hours. 

Rice. — For a side-dish with roast meats, put a cup of rice into 
cold water with a spoonful of salt; keep it covered while boiling that 
the grains may swell, and do not stir it much after it is cooked, as 
it looks better when the grains are whole. Add a cup of milk and a 
lump of butter just before serving. 

Canning Corn. — Shave the corn from the cob, fill the cans as full 
as you can with corn, then pour in cold water until even full ; make 
a small hole in the cover and solder on it. Place the cans in a boiler 
with cold water about half the height of the cans. Place the boiler 
on the stove, and boil four hours ; then remove them from the boiler 
and drop a little solder on the hole in the cover. 

To Dry Green Corn. — On a warm, bright day take a shallow box, 
set slanting, where the sun will shine full upon it. Spread clean 
cloths in your box. Prepare your corn as you like, and spread it 
evenly over the bottom of the box; then cover very closely with a 



466 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

window-sash. The heat will be so great no fly can live. Your corn 
will dry in one day and be perfectly clean. 

HiGDUM. — Four quarts of cucumbers chopped fine with skins on ; 
add two quarts of chopped onions; mix in a handful of salt, and let 
it drain six hours. Then add one gill of sweet oil, one pint of Madeira 
wine, a tablespoonful of black pepper, one of cayenne, one of mustard- 
seed, one of flour of mustard. Put it in a stone jar, and cover with 
strong vinegar. 

Fried Celery.— Boil the celery entire until tender; drain it, divide 
into small pieces and fry in dripping until lightly browned. 

Boiled Onions, to be free of strong odor, should be boiled in salted 
water for ten minutes, and then put in cold fresh water for half an 
hour; after that they should be put into a stewpan with just enough 
cold fresh water to cover them, and boiled gently till tender. Drain 
and serve with melted butter. 

EGGS, OMELETS, ETC. 

Egg-baskets {a nice breakfast disK). — Make them the day after 
having roast turkey or chicken for dinner. Boil six eggs hard, re- 
move the shells, cut neatly in halves, and extract the yolks. Rub 
them to a paste, with some melted butter, pepper and salt, and set 
aside. Pound the minced meat of the cold fowl finely, and mix with 
the egg-paste, moistening with a little melted butter or gravy left 
from the roast. Cut off a slice from the bottom of the hollowed 
white, to make them stand ; fill with the paste, arrange close together 
on a flat dish, and pour over the rest of the gravy left from the roast, 
heated boiling hot and enriched by a few spoonfuls of cream. 

To keep Eggs Fresh. — One of the best means of preserving eggs 
is the following : Select good fresh eggs and pack endwise in a mix- 
ture of equal parts of fine dry charcoal and salt (cold). Keep in a 
cool, dry place until required for use. A thin coating of gum or a 
trace of oil will prevent loss of moisture through the shell. The best 
time for preserving eggs is from July to September. 

For Testing the Age of Eggs. — Dissolve 120 grammes of com- 



COOKERY RECIPES. 467 

mon salt in a liter of water. An egg put in this solution on the day 
it is laid will sink to the bottom ; one a day old will not reach quite 
to the bottom of the vessel; an egg three days old will swim in the 
liquid; while one more than three days old will swim on the surface. 
Omelet. — Five or six eggs will make a good-sized omelet ; break 
them into a basin, and beat them well with a fork, and add a saltspoon- 
ful of salt ; have some parsley ready chopped ; beat it well up with the 
eggs ; then take four ounces of fresh butter, and break half of it into 
large bits, and put it into the omelet, and the other half into a very 
clean frying-pan ; when it is melted, pour in the omelet, and stir it 
with a spoon till it begins to set, then turn it up all round the edges, 
and when it is of a nice brown it is done. The safest way to take it 
out is to put a plate on the omelet, and turn the pan upside-down ; 
serve it on a hot dish ; it should never-be done till just wanted. 

Tomato Omelet (i). — Tomatoes, thickened with bread-crumbs, 
seasoned with salt, pepper, chopped parsley and sugar ; add one egg 
to every pint of this mixture. Sprinkle bread-crumbs over the top, 
and bake forty minutes ; a nice dinner vegetable. 

Tomato Omelet (2). — Beat up six eggs, mix two tablespoon- 

fuls of flour with a little milk, and add pepper and salt to taste. Peel 

and chop very fine four tomatoes, stir all together, and fry in butter. 

Oyster Omelet is made in the same way, using oysters instead 

of tomatoes. 

Washington Omelet. — Make four omelets of three eggs each, 
adding to one two chopped, tart apples ; to another, chopped, cold 
boiled ham ; to another, an assortment of fine herbs — a small pinch 
of each — and the fourth omelet plain, or with asparagus or cauli- 
flower, in their season. Serve on the same dish, one lapping over 
another, and very hot. 

Rum Omelet. — Make a plain omelet, with a little sugar added, and 
when on the table pour a gill or so of rum over it, set fire to it, let it 
burn as long as it can, taking slowly, but constantly, with a silver 
spoon, the rum from the sides, and pouring it on the middle while it 
i.s burning, and until it dies out by itself; then serve immediately. 



468 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

Made with oysters or sweetmeats of any kind omelets are a very 
popular entree or side-dish for dinner. With ham, kidneys or any 
kind of meat they are proper only for breakfast dishes. 

Asparagus Omelet. — Steam and cut up fine the asparagus, in 
quantity about a pint, then beat the yolks of five and the whites of 
three eggs lightly; add two spoonfuls of cream, mix all, fry in 
omelets and serve hot. Cauliflowers may be served in the same 
way. 

Buttered Eggs. — Four new-laid eggs, two ounces of butter. Pro- 
cure the eggs new-laid, if possible ; break them into a basin and beat 
them well ; put the butter into another basin, which place in boiling 
water, and stir till the butter is melted. Pour that and the eggs into 
a lined saucepan ; hold it over a gentle fire, and, as the mixture begins 
to warm, pour it two or three times into the basin and back again, 
that the two ingredients may be well incorporated. Keep stirring 
the eggs and butter one way until they are hot, without boiling, and 
serve on hot buttered toast. If the mixture is allowed to boil, it will 
curdle, and so be entirely spoiled. 

Stuffed Eggs. — Boil your eggs hard and carefully remove the 
shells. Cut off the small end of each egg, and pick out the yolks. 
Put these latter in a pan, into which put grated crackers, celery seeds, 
butter, pepper and salt. Rub well together. Carefully stuff the eggs 
again, and replace the small ends previously removed. Stand them 
in a soup-plate or pan, and grate crackers over and around them, and 
add any of the yolks that may have been left of the stuffing. They 
make a delicious and rich dish. 

Pickled Eggs. — Boil one dozen fresh eggs fifteen minutes ; put 
them in cold water to cool ; take off the shells and place them in a 
jar; cover them with good vinegar; these are good in spring, with 
fish or cold meat. 

Poached Eggs. — -Eggs for poaching should be perfectly fresh, 
but not quite new-laid; those that are about thirty-six hours old 
are the best for the purpose. If quite new-laid, the white is so 
milky it is almost impossible to set it ; and, on the other hand, if the 



COOKERY RECIPES. 469 

egg be at all stale, it is equally difficult to poach it nicely. Strain 
some boiling water into a deep, clean frying-pan ; break the egg into 
a cup without damaging the yolk, and when the water boils remove 
the pan to the side of the fire, and gently slip the egg into it. Place 
the pan over a gentle fire and keep the water simmering until the 
white looks nicely set, when the egg is ready. Take it up gently 
with a slice, cut away the ragged edges of the white, and serve either 
on toasted bread or on slices of ham or bacon, or on spinach, etc. 
A poached egg should not be overdone, as its appearance and taste 
will be quite spoiled if the yolk be allowed to harden. When the 
egg is slipped into the water, the white should be gathered together 
to keep it a little in form, or the cup should be turned over it for one- 
half minute. To poach an egg to perfection is rather a difficult 
operation ; so, for inexperienced cooks, a tin egg-poacher may be 
purchased, which greatly facilitates the manner of dressing eggs. It 
consists of a tin-plate with a handle, with a space for three perforated 
cups. An egg should be broken into each cup, and the machine then 
placed in a stewpan of boiling water, which has been previously 
strained. When the whites of the eggs appear set they are done, 
and should then be carefully slipped on to the toast or spinach, or 
with whatever they are served. In poaching eggs in a frying-pan 
never do more than four at a time; and when a little vinegar is 
liked mixed with the water in which the eggs are done, use one table- 
spoonful to every pint of water. 

To Boil Eggs for Breakfast, Salads, etc. — Eggs for boiling 
cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after they are laid ; but rather 
a longer time should be allowed for boiling a new-laid egg than for 
one that is three or four days old. Have ready a saucepan of boil- 
ing water ; put the eggs into it gently with a spoon, letting the spoon 
touch the bottom of the saucepan before it is withdrawn, that the. 
egg may not fall, and consequently crack. For those who like eggs 
lightly boiled, three minutes will be found sufficient ; three and three- 
quarters to four minutes will be ample time to set the white nicely; 
and if liked hard, six to seven minutes will not be found too long. 



470 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Should the eggs be unusually large, as those of black Spanish fowl 
sometimes are, allow an extra one-half minute for them. Eggs for 
salad should be boiled from ten minutes to one-quarter hour, and 
should be placed in a basin of cold water for a few minutes ; they 
should then be rolled on the table with the hand, and the shell will 
peel off easily. To boil eggs lightly, for invalids or children, keep 
them on three minutes ; to boil eggs to suit the generality of tastes, 
three and three-quarters to four minutes; to boil eggs hard, six to 
seven minutes ; for salads, ten to fifteen minutes. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Have a spider hot and buttered; break the 
eggs into a dish, being careful not to break the yolks ; slip them into 
the spider, add a very little salt, with butter the size of a nutmeg for 
a half dozen of eggs, or three tablespoonfuls of rich cream. When 
the eggs begin to whiten, stir carefully from the bottom until cooked 
to suit. 

Fried Eggs. — Four eggs, a quarter pound of lard, butter or clari- 
fied dripping. Place a delicately clean frying-pan over a gentle fire ; 
put in the fat, and allow it to come to the boiling-point. Break the 
eggs into cups, slip them into the boiling fat, and let them remain 
until the whites are delicately set, and, whilst they are frying, ladle a 
little of the fat over them. Take them up with a slice, drain them a 
minute from their greasy moisture, trim them neatly, and serve on 
slices of fried bacon or ham, or the eggs may be placed in the middle 
of the dish, with the bacon put round as a garnish. 

Poached Eggs with Cream. — One pint of water, one teaspoonful 
of salt, four teaspoonfuls of vinegar, four fresh eggs„half a gill of 
cream, salt, pepper and pounded sugar to taste, one ounce of butter.' 
Put the water, vinegar and salt into a frying-pan, and break each egg 
into a separate cup; bring the water, etc., to boil, and slip the eggs 
gently into it without breaking the yolks. Simmer them from three 
to four minutes, but not longer, and with a slice lift them out on to 
a hot dish, and trim the edges. Empty the pan of its contents, put 
in the cream, add a seasoning to taste, of pepper, salt and pounded 
sugar; bring the whole to the boiling-point; then add the butter,

broken into small pieces ; toss the pan round and round till the butter 
is mfelted ; pour it over the eggs and serve. To insure the eggs not 
being spoiled whilst the cream, etc., is preparing, it is a good plan to 
warm the cream with the butter, etc., before the eggs are poached, 
so that it may be poured over them immediately after they are 
dished. 

Toast and Eggs. — Break three eggs into a small stewpan ; add a 
saltspoonful of salt, a quarter of that quantity of pepper, and two 
ounces of fresh butter (the fresher the better) ; set the stewpan over a 
moderate fire, and stir the eggs round with a wooden spoon, being 
careful to keep every particle in motion, until the whole has be- 
come a smooth and delicately thick substance ; have ready a con- 
venient-sized crisp piece of toast, pour the eggs upon it, and serve 
immediately. 

Eggs in Italian Style. — Moisten two spoonfuls of flour with 
four ounces of butter in a saucepan, stirring constantly. When of 
the consistency of thick cream, thin with a little boiling milk, and 
add salt and pepper. Add three ounces more of butter and a little 
chopped parsley, worked well together. Have ready eight hard- 
boiled eggs, sliced, and add to the same and serve. 

SALADS. 

Mustard Salad. — The following is an excellent dressing: Take 
the yolk of one fresh egg and mix it with two tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil, very slowly. Add one and one-half spoonfuls of mustard, 
three spoonfuls of salt, a little pepper, and, last of all, two spoon- 
fuls of vinegar. Beat the white of the egg to a stiff froth, and stir 
lightly in. 

Cabbage Dressing. — One egg, one tablespoonful of mustard, and 
one teaspoonful of butter, mixed together. Half a teacup of vinegar. 
Put it on the stove, and stir until thickened, but do not let it boil. 

Salad Dressing {excellent). — Take the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, 
a little salt, red pepper, and the yolk of a raw egg. Add oil slowly 
as you mix it with the back of a fork, stirring it all the time one

way. One tablespoonful of cream or condensed milk, and the juice 
of a lemon. 

Salad Sauce. — Boil one egg hard ; when cold, remove the yolk, 
bruise it to a pulp with a spoon, then add a raw yolk and a teaspoon- 
ful of flour, a small teaspoonful of salt and a trifle of pepper ; to 
this add half a spoonful of vinegar ; stir it ; pour over it a teaspoon- 
ful of oil by degrees ; keep stirring, then a little more vinegar and 
more of oil, until eight teaspoonfuls of oil and three of vinegar are 
used. 

Chicken Salad. — Take the white meat of a cold boiled or 
roasted chicken or turkey. Cut three-fourths the same quantity of 
celery into small bits, mix thoroughly with the well-minced meat 
and set in a cool place while preparing the dressing. Rub the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs to a powder, to which add one teaspoonful 
of salt, one of pepper, two of white sugar, and three teaspoonfuls of 
salad oil, adding it drop by drop, then add half a teaspoonful of mus- 
tard. Whip one egg to a froth and beat it into the dressing, and 
over the whole pour one-half cup of vinegar, one teaspoonful at a 
time, whipping constantly. Sprinkle a little salt over the meat and 
celery, and pour the prepared dressing over it, tossing with a large 
silver fork until thoroughly mixed. Turn into the salad-bowl and 
garnish tastefully with whites of eggs and sprigs of bleached celery- 
tops. Among the many receipts for chicken salad, this is unsurpassed 
for deliciousness. 

Dressing for Chicken Salad. — Two teaspoonfuls of mustard and 
salt stirred in a thick paste; next the oil; then the cayenne and the 
yolks of two hard-boiled eggs mashed very fine. Then two raw eggs, 
and lastly the vinegar. This is for one chicken only. 

Cabbage Salad (i). — Shave a hard, white cabbage into small strips; 
take the yolks of three well-beaten eggs, a cup and a half of good 
cider-vinegar, two teaspoonfuls of thick cream, one teaspoonful of 
mustard mixed in a little boiling water ; salt and pepper to suit the 
taste. Mix all but the eggs together, and let it boil ; then stir in the 
eggs, rapidly turn the cabbage into the mixture, and stir well. Make

enough for two days at once ; it keeps perfectly, and is an excellent 
relish for all kinds of meat. 

Cabbage Salad (2). — One quart of very finely-chopped cabbage, 
two-thirds of a cup of sour cream, two well-beaten eggs; season to 
taste with sugar, salt, pepper and mustard. If you have no celery to 
chop with your cabbage, put in a tablespoonful of celery-seed. Add 
a little vinegar. This is very fine, will Iceep well several days and is 
excellent for picnics. 

Carrot Salad. — Select very tender, rich-colored carrots, and scrape 
and boil them in fast-boiling water till tender; cut into very thin slices, 
put them into a glass salad-bowl, and sprinkle with sifted loaf-sugar ; 
add the juice of a large, fresh lemon, and a wineglassful of olive oil. 
By way of garnish, place round the margin of the dish an onion cut 
in exceedingly thin slices, and small bunches of any fresh, green salad- 
leaves. 

Shrimp Salad. — Dress some lettuce with a mayonnaise sauce and 
arrange plenty of canned shrimps or fresh-boiled ones around it. 

Cold Slaw. — Yolks of two eggs, a tablespoonful of cream, a small 
teaspoonful of mustard, a little salt, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 
If cream is not used, put in a small lump of butter, rubbed in a little 
flour. Cut the cabbage as fine as possible. Heat the mixture, and 
pour it on hot. 

Hot Slaw. — Cut a good cabbage, and with a sharp knife slice it 
fine ; put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter, and salt and pepper 
to taste; pour in just hot water enough to prevent it sticking to the 
pan, cover it closely and let it stew ; stir it frequently, and when it is 
quite tender, add a little vinegar and serve it hot. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. — The following recipe for a mayonnaise 
dressing for salad is prepared in New York : One pint of olive oil, 
salt and cayenne pepper to taste, half a teaspoonful of French mus- 
tard, the juice of one lemon, and vinegar; take an earthen dish, rub 
a clove of garlic on the bottom of the dish, then place in it the yolks 
of two raw eggs, salt, pepper, and mustard ; take the bottle contain- 
ing the oil in the left hand and a wire whip in the right hand ; pour

the oil very slowly and keep stirring the yolks. Should it become 
stiff add a little vinegar. Keep adding oil and vinegar until you have 
used the pint of oil, but be careful not to add too much vinegar. 
Finish with the lemon-juice. The dressing should be of rather a 
stiff consistency, and will keep any length of time if it is covered 
so that the air will not reach it. 

PIES. 

The flour should be of the best quality, and perfectly dry, and 
sifted before being used ; if in the least damp, the paste made from it 
will certainly be heavy. It should be kept in a bin expressly made 
for the purpose. 

Butter, unless fresh is used, should be washed from the salt, and 
well squeezed and wrung in a cloth to get out all the water and 
buttermilk, which, if left in, assists to make the paste heavy. 

Lard should be perfectly sweet, which may be ascertained by 
cutting the bladder through, and, if the knife smells sweet, the lard 
is good. 

In mixing paste, add the water very gradually, work the whole 
together with a knife -blade, and knead it until perfectly smooth. 

Those who are inexperienced in pastry-making should work the 
butter in by breaking it in small pieces, and covering the paste 
rolled out. It should then be dredged with flour and the ends folded 
over, and rolled out very thin again ; this process must be repeated 
until all the butter is used. 

The art of making paste requires much practice, dexterity and 
skill. It should be touched as lightly as possible, made with cool 
hands, and in a cool place (a marble slab is better than a board for 
the purpose), and the coolest part of the house should be selected 
for the process during warm weather. 

To insure rich paste being light, great expedition must be used in 
making and baking ; for if it stands long before it is put in the oven 
it becomes flat and heavy. 

Puff-paste requires a brisk oven, but not too hot, or it would 



COOKERY RECIPES. 475 

olacken the crust; on the other hand, if the oven be too slack, 
the paste will be soddened and will not rise, nor will it have any 
color. 

Tart-tins, cake-moulds, dishes for the baked puddings, patty-pans, 
etc., should all be buttered before the article intended to be baked 
is put in them ; things to be baked on sheets should be placed on 
buttered paper. Raised pie-paste should have a soaking heat, and 
paste glazed must have a rather slack oven, that the icing be not 
scorched. 

It is better to ice tarts, etc., when they are three parts baked. 

To ascertain when the oven is heated to the proper degree for puff- 
paste, put a small piece of the paste in previous to baking the whole, 
and the heat can thus be judged of 

Pie-crust. — Allow half a pound of shortening to a pound of flour. 
If liked quite short, allow three-quarters of a pound of shortening to 
a pound of flour. Pie-crust looks the nicest made entirely of lard, 
but it does not taste so good as it does to have some butter used in 
making it. In winter, beef shortening,. mixed with butter, makes good, 
plain pie-crust. Rub half of the shortening with two-thirds of the 
flour ; to each pound of flour put a teaspoonful of salt. When the 
shortening is thoroughly mixed with the flour, add just sufficient 
cold water to render it moist enough to roll out easily. Divide the 
crust into two equal portions ; lay one of them one side for the upper 
crust ; take the other, roll it out quite thin, flouring your rolling-pin 
and boarcf, so that the crust will not stick to them, and line your pie- 
plates, which should be previously buttered. Fill your plates with 
your fruit, then roll out the upper crust as thin as possible. Spread 
on the reserved shortening, sprinkle over the flour, roll it up, and 
cut it into as many pieces as you have pies to cover it. Roll each 
one about half an inch thick, and cover the pies ; trim the edges off 
neatly with a knife, and press the crust down round the edges of the 
plates with a jagging-iron, so that the juices of the fruit may not run 
out while baking. Pastry, to be nice, should be baked in a quick 
oven. In cold weather it is necessary to warm the shortening be-

fore using it for pie-crust, but it must not be melted, or the crust will 
not be flaky. 

Very good Puff-paste. — To every pound of flour allow one pound 
of butter, and not quite a half-pint of water. Carefully weigh the 
flour and butter, and have the exact proportion ; squeeze the butter 
well to extract the water from it, and afterward wring it in a clean 
cloth, that no moisture may remain. Sift the flour ; see that it is 
perfectly dry, and proceed in the following manner to make the paste, 
using a very clean paste-board and rolling-pin : Supposing the quan- 
tity to be one pound of flour, work the whole into a smooth paste, 
with not quite a half pint of water, using a knife to mix it with; the 
proportion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the discretion 
of the cook ; if too much be added, the paste, when baked, will be 
tough. Roll it out until it is of an equal thickness of about an inch ; 
break four ounces of the butter into small pieces ; place these on the 
paste, sift over it a little flour, fold it over, roll out again, and put 
another four ounces of butter. 

Repeat the rolling and buttering until the paste has been rolled 
out four times, or equal quantities of flour and butter have been 
used. Do not omit, every time the paste is rolled out, to dredge a 
little flour over that and the rolling-pin to prevent both from sticking. 
Handle the paste as lightly as possible, and do not press heavily 
upon it with the rolling-pin. The next thing to be considered is the 
oven, as the baking of pastry requires particular attention. Do not 
put it into the oven until it is sufficiently hot to raise the paste ; for 
the best prepared paste, if not properly baked, will be good for nothing. 
Brushing the paste, as often as rolled out, and the pieces of butter 
placed thereon, with the white of an egg, assists it to rise in leaves or 
flakes. As this is the great beauty of puff"-paste, it is as well to try 
this method. 

Pastry. — An excellent pastry, that never fails to be good, is made 
of one pound of flour and half a pound of butter. Leave a part of 
the flour out, and cut the butter into the flour with a knife. A very 
little salt, a small quantity of cold water, and mix it with a spoon. 
Then use the remaining flour for rolling it out. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 477 

When pastry or baked puddings are not done through, and yet 
the outside is sufficiently brown, cover them over with a piece of 
white paper until thoroughly cooked ; this prevents them from getting 
burnt. 

Potato Pie. — Boil Carolina or mealy Irish potatoes until they are 
quite soft. When peeled, mash and strain them. To a quarter of a 
pound of potatoes, put a quart of milk, three tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter, four beaten eggs, a wine-glass of wine ; add sugar and nutmeg 
to the taste. 

Peach Pie. — Take mellow, juicy peaches, peel and slice and put 
them in a deep pie-plate lined with pie-crust ; sprinkle a thick layer of 
sugar on each layer of peaches ; put in about a tablespoonful of water 
and sprinkle a little flour over the top ; cover it with a thick crust, and 
bake the pie from fifty to sixty minutes. 

Custard Pie. — Boil a quart of milk with half a dozen peach- 
leaves or the rind of a lemon. When they have flavored the milk 
strain it, and set it where it will boil. Mix a tablespoonful of flour, 
smoothly, with a couple of tablespoonfuls of milk, and stir it in the 
boiling milk. Let it boil a minute, stirring it constantly ; take it from 
the fire, and when cool, put in three beaten eggs ; sweeten to the 
taste ; turn it into deep pie-plates, and bake the pies directly in a 
quick oven. 

CocoANUT Pie. — To one grated cocoanut add three large boiled 
and mashed potatoes. Boil them fresh and pound them ; add a little 
butter, milk and salt. Then mix the cocoanut and potatoes, add the 
yolks of three eggs well beaten. Make a crust with one pound of 
flour and half a pound of butter. Put only an undercrust. When 
the pie is baked, beat the whites of the three eggs very light ; add a 
little white sugar, and put it on the top while it is hot. Then put it 
back in the oven for a few moments. 

Lemon Pie (i). — Two lemons, two cups of sugar, one cup of milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of flour and six eggs. Use the yolks only. After 
the pies are baked, beat the whites and add eight tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. Spread it over the pies ; put them in the oven till they be- 
come a light brown. 



478 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Lemon Pie (2). — Seven eggs. Leave out the whites of three; 
butter, the size of a small egg ; one cup and a half of sugar. These 
ingredients to be beaten to a cream. Juice of two lemons — grated 
rind of one. Milk enough to fill a deep pie-plate. The three whites, 
after the pie is baked, must be beaten with a little powdered sugar, 
and put on the top of the pie. Bake with a pastry crust under it as 
with any other kind of pie. 

Lemon Custard Pie. — For two pies, mix together the yolks of 
six eggs (well beaten), four heaped fciblespoopfuls of white coffee 
sugar, the grated rinds of three large lemons, and about one pint of 
milk. Bake in one crust ; put on a frosting made of the whites of 
four eggs, four tablespoonfuls of white sugar and the juice of three 
lemons ; bake till the frosting is a pale brown. 

Lemon Cream Pie. — One cup of sugar, one raw potato grated, one 
cup of water, one lemon grated and juice added, baked in pastry, 
top and bottom. This amount will make one pie. 

Tarlaton Pie. — One cup of cream ; one cup stewed apple — rubbed 
through a sieve; two eggs; flavor to the taste. 

Cherry Pie. — Lay the cherries in a deep baking-dish, with plenty 
of sugar and a tablespoonful of flour. Place an inverted cup in the 
middle of the dish, and cover the whole with a crust. The cup pre 
vents the crust from soaking into the juice of the fruit. 

Pumpkin Pie. — Cut the pumpkin in halves and remove the seeds ; 
then cut it into small pieces, and put the whole on to boil with a pint 
of water poured over them ; this moistens it sufficiently at first, and 
if the pumpkin is stirred frequently it will not burn, as it softens by 
cooking if it has sufficient moisture of its own. Let it stew an hour 
or more after it becomes soft ; then strain it through a colander into 
a large pan ; to each quart of pumpkin add one quart of milk and four 
eggs; sweeten to suit taste with sugar, spice, cinnamon and ginger. 
After all is prepared, set the pan containing the mixture upon a kettle 
of warm water, that the whole may become warm while you prepare 
the crusts for the several pies. Bake the crusts a little before pour- 
ing the pumpkin into them. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 479 

Mince Pie (i). — Two pounds of lean teef boiled and chopped fine; 
one pound of suet chopped fine; two pounds of raisins; one pound 
of Sultana raisins; two pounds of currants; three-quarters of a pound 
of citron; two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon; two tablespoonfuls of mace; 
one tablespoonful of cloves; one tablespoonful of allspice; one table- 
spoonful of salt; one nutmeg; two and a half pounds of brown sugar; 
five pounds of apples; gne quart of cider; one pint of brandy; juice 
of three oranges and rind of two oranges. 

Mince Pie (2). — Two pounds of meat chopped fine and boiled; two 
pounds of sugar; two pounds of currants; two pounds of chopped 
apples; one pound of chopped suet; quarter of a pound of cloves; 
quarter of a pound of mace; season with nutmeg, cinnamon and 
citron to taste ; one pint of wine ; one pint of brandy ; three pints of 
sweet cider. 

Cream Raspberry Tarts {very fine). — Line a dish with paste, and 
fill with raspberries made very sweet with powdered sugar. Cover 
with paste, but do not pinch it down at the edges. When done, lift 
the top crust, which should be thicker than usual, and pour upon the 
fruit the following mixture : One small cup of milk — half cream, if 
it is to be had — heated to boiling ; whites of two eggs, beaten light, 
and stirred into the boiling milk ; one teaspoonful of white sugar, one- 
half teaspoonful of corn-starch, wet in cold milk ; boil these ingredi- 
ents three minutes ; let them get perfectly cold before putting them 
into the tart. Replace the top crust, and set the tart aside to cool. 
Sprinkle sugar over the top before serving. Peach or strawberry tart 
can be made in the same way. 

PUDDINGS. 

The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of much importaace, 
as one bad article will taint the whole mixture. 

When the freshness of eggs is doubtful, break each one separately 
in a cup before mixing them together. Should there be a bad one 
amongst them, it can be thrown away, whereas if mixed with the 
(Tood ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled. The yolks and 



4.8o THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

whites beaten separately make the articles they are put into much 
lighter. 

Raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked, 
and in many cases stoned. Currants should be well washed, pressed 
in a cloth, and placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly dry; 
they should be picked carefully over, and every piece of grit or stone 
removed from amongst them. To plump them, some cooks pour 
boiling water over them, and then dry them before the fire. 

Batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps. 
To insure this, first mix the flour with a very small proportion of 
milk, and add the remainder by degrees. Should the pudding be very 
lumpy, it may be strained through a hair-sieve. 

All boiled puddings should be put on in boiling water, which must 
not be allowed to stop simmering, and the pudding must always be 
covered with the water; if requisite, the saucepan should be kept 
filled up. 

For baked or boiled puddings, the moulds, cups or basins should 
be always buttered before the mixture is put into them, and they 
should be put into the saucepan directly they are filled. 

Scrupulous attention should be paid to the cleanliness of pudding- 
cloths, as from neglect in this particular the outsides of boiled pud- 
dings frequently taste very disagreeably. As soon as possible after 
it is taken off the pudding it should be soaked in water, and then 
well washed, without soap, unless it be very greasy. It should be 
dried out of doors, then folded up and kept in a dry place. When 
wanted for use, dip it in boiling water, and dredge it slightly with 
flour. 

The dry ingredients for puddings are better for being mixed some 
time before they are wanted ; the liquid portion should only be added 
just before the pudding is put into the saucepan. 

A pinch of salt is an improvement to the generality of puddings ; 
but this ingredient should be added very sparingly, as the flavor 
.sho'uld not be detected. 

Baked Puddings. — When baked puddings are sufficiently solid, 



COOKERY RECIPES. 48 1 

turn them out of the dish they were baked in, bottom uppermost, and 
strew over them finely sifted sugar. 

Baked Rice Pudding. — One teacupful of rice, two tablespoonfuls 
of moist sugar, one quart of milk, half an ounce of butter, or two 
small tablespoonfuls of chopped suet, half a teaspoonful of grated 
nutmeg. Wash the rice, put it into a pie-dish with the sugar, pour 
in the milk, and stir these ingredients well together; then add the 
butter, cut up into very small pieces, or, instead of this, the above 
proportion of finely minced suet ; grate a little nutmeg over the top, 
and bake the pudding, in a moderate oven, from an hour and a half 
to two hours. As the rice is not previously cooked, care must be • 
taken that the pudding be very slowly baked, to give plenty of time 
for the rice to swell, and for it to be very thoroughly done. 

Boiled Rice Pudding. — Quarter of a pound of rice, one pint and 
a-half of new milk, two ounces of butter, four eggs, half a saltspoonful 
of salt, four large tablespoonfuls of moist sugar ; flavoring to taste. 
Stew the rice very gently in the above proportion of new milk, and 
when it is tender pour it into a basin ; stir in the butter, and let it 
stand to cool ; then beat the eggs, add these to the rice with the 
sugar, salt, and any flavoring that may be approved — such as nutmeg, 
powdered cinnamon, grated lemon-peel, essence of bitter almonds, or 
vanilla. When all is well stirred, put the pudding into a buttered 
basin, tie it down with a cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil 
for an hour and a-quarter. 

Lemon Sauce. — Slice a lemon; take the seeds out, so as not to get 
the bitter ; put it with a pint of sugar and a small quantity of water ; 
let it boil, and add a piece of butter. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare your apples quickly, and pour on boiling 
water. Cook rapidly to avoid discoloration, and keep the fruit cov- 
ered while cooking. 

Sauce for Baked Pudding. — Take one pint of water, a large 
teacup of sugar, a piece of butter the size of a large egg, a little nut- 
meg and essence of lemon, and bring it to a boil. Now take a little 
flour or corn-starch (which is best), well beaten into a paste and

thinned, and stir gradually till of the consistency of cream, or as 
thick as you like; then add a large tablespoonful of vinegar or 
brandy. 

Pudding Sauce (i). — Stir half a cup of butter with half a cup of 
sugar; a little flour. Pour boiling water over the whole. Add wine 
just before going to- the table. 

Pudding Sauce (2). — One cup of milk, one of sugar, one of butter, 
one tablespoonful of flour; rub the sugar, butter and flour together; 
bring the milk to a boil, and stir in the other, then boil a second 
time. Season to suit taste. 

Corn-starch Pudding. — One quart of milk, one teacup of starch, 
one teaspoon of salt, three eggs well beaten. Dissolve the starch in 
a little of the milk, putting the remainder on to boil. When boiling, 
take it off and stir in the starch first, then add the eggs. Turn it 
into forms and serve cold, or bake it, which is an improvement. 

For sauce, beat cream and loaf-sugar together, and flavor it to your 
taste. 

Home Pudding. — One pint of milk, yolks of two eggs, three 
crackers rolled fine and bake. Use three-fourths of a cup of sugar, 
and the whites for frosting ; spread over the pudding, and return to 
the oven for a few minutes. 

To Make an Indian Pudding. — One quart sweet skimmed milk ; 
let it come to a boil, then stir in one cup Indian meal and one hand- 
ful of flour ; pour it into a baking-pan and add two-thirds of a cup of 
molasses, teaspoonful of salt and one cup of cold milk. Bake four 
hours. Slice in two or three apples if convenient to do so. 

Bread Pudding. — One pint of fine bread-crumbs, one quart of 
milk, one cup of sugar. The yolks of four eggs beaten. A piece of 
butter the size of an egg. Grated rind of a lemon. Bake until done, 
but not watery. Whip the whites of the eggs stiff", and beat in a cup 
of sugar in which has been stirred the juice of a lemon. Spread 
over the pudding a layer of jelly ; pour the whites of the eggs over 
this and replace in the oven and bake lightly. 

English Plum Pudding. — One pound of flour, one pound of raisins, 



COOKERY RECIPES. 483 

one pound of currants, one pound of suet, one pound of powdered 
crackers, eight eggs, a small quantity of salt ; spice to the taste with 
cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and citron, four ounces of candied lemon 
and orange peel, one wine-glass of brandy, one wine-glass of rum, 
one pound of sugar, one pint of milk and water. Boil it six or 
eight hours, and tie the bag loosely so as to allow the rum to swell. 

Plum Pudding. — Take a sixpenny loaf of stale baker's bread, cut 
in small pieces (except the under crust) ; lay it in a pan, and pour a 
quart and a pint of boiling milk over it ; let it stand an hour or two, 
then mash it quite fine, and, when it is cold, stir in some flour — two 
or three handfuls — add seven eggs well beaten, three-quarters of a 
pound of beef suet chopped very fine, two pounds of stoned raisins, 
one pound of currants, a small quantity of cinnamon and cloves, 
quarter of a pound of citron, two nutmegs. Boil it three hours, and 
have the water boiling when it is put in ; also have a tea-kettle of 
hot water to fill up the pot. 

Carrot Plum Pudding. — One-quarter pound of flour, one-quarter 
pound of suet, one-quarter pound of grated carrots (raw) ; one-quarter 
pound of potatoes, mashed free from lumps ; one-quarter pound of 
currants, one-quarter pound of raisins, one ounce of candied peel, a 
little nutmeg and other spices mixed together. No liquid is required 
to mix this pudding ; the carrots will give sufficient moisture ; and if 
they are fresh and fine, it is impossible to detect their presence in the 
pudding. Boil six hours and serve with good brandy sauce. 

PuFFETS. — Beat two heaping tablespoonfuls of cream tartar in three 
pints of well-sifted flour ; beat three eggs well ; one cup of sugar ; 
one cup of soft butter ; add one pint of milk, into which dissolve one 
teaspoonful of soda, after which add the flour. Mix lightly, and bake 
thirty minutes in a quick oven ; pour it all in a dripping-pan, and 
when done cut it in small square pieces. 

Steam Pudding {Good). — Half a cup of sugar; three tablespoon- 
fuls of butter ; two eggs well beaten ; two cups of sweet milk ; flour 
enough to make a stiff batter ; one teaspoonful of soda ; two of cream 
tartar ; one cup of currants, and one of raisins. Boil it two hours ; 
eat it with cold sauce. 



484 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Hasty Pudding. — Boil water, a quart, three pints, or two quarts, 
according to the size of family ; sift your meal, stir five or six spoon- 
fuls of it thoroughly into a bowl of water ; when the water in the 
kettle boils, pour into it the contents of the bowl ; stir it well and let 
it boil up thick ; put in salt to suit your taste, then stand over the 
kettle and sprinkle in meal, handful after handful, stirring it very 
thoroughly all the time, and letting it boil between whiles. When it 
is so thick that you stir it with difficulty, it is about right. It takes 
about half an hour's cooking. Eat with milk or molasses. Either 
Indian meal or rye meal may be used. 

Green Corn Pudding. — Allow one long ear of sweet corn for each 
person ; take half a pint of milk, one egg, a dessertspoonful of white 
sugar, one of sweet butter, and a teaspoonful of salt to every two ears ; 
beat the egg and sugar well together, and add the milk and salt ; cut 
the corn off the cobs with a sharp knife, and chop the divided grains 
with a chopping-knife, but not too fine — or, better still, split each row 
of grains down the middle before cutting them off the cobs ; stir the 
chopped corn into the milk, and bake in a brisk oven in custard-cups 
or a tin pan until the top is nicely browned, but not hardened. Serve 
hot, without sauce. Some prefer it cold.

tablespoonfuls of tapioca, four beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, 
and cinnamon or mace to the taste ; mix four tablespoonfuls of white 
powdered sugar and a wine-glass of wine ; stir it into the rest of the

CREAMS, JELLIES, CUSTARDS, ETC. 

Jelly Moulded with Fresh Fruit, or Macedoine de Fruits. — 
Rather more than a pint and a half of jelly, a few nice strawberries, 
or red or white currants, or raspberries, or any fresh fruit that may 
be in season. Have ready the above proportion of jelly, which must 
be very clear and rather sweet, the raw fruit requiring an additional 
quantity of sugar. Select ripe, nice-looking fruit; pick off the stalks, 
unless currants are used, when they are laid in the jelly as they come 
from the tree. Begin by putting a little jelly at the bottom of the 
mould, which must harden ; then arrange the fruit round the sides 
of the mould, recollecting that it will be reversed when turned out; 
then pour in some more jelly to make the fruit adhere, and when that 
layer is set, put another row of fruit and jelly until the mould is full. 
If convenient, put it in ice until required !br table ; then wring a cloth 
in boiling, water, wrap it round the mould for a minute, and turn the 
jelly carefully out. Peaches, apricots, plums, apples, etc., are better 
for being boiled in a little clear syrup before they are laid in the jelly; 
strawberries, raspberries, grapes, cherries and currants are put in raw. 
In winter, when fresh fruits are not obtainable, a very pretty jelly 
may be made with preserved fruits or brandy cherries ; these, in a 
bright and clear jelly, have a very pretty effect ; of course, unless the 
jelly be very clear, the beauty of the dish will be spoiled. It may be 
garnished with the same fruit as is laid in the jelly; for instance, an 
open jelly with strawberries might have, piled in the centre, a few of 
the same fruit prettily arranged, or a little whipped cream might be 



COOKERY RECIPES. 487 

substituted for the fruit. One layer of Jelly should remain two hours 
in a very cool place before another layer is added. 

Tapioca Cream. — Put two tablespoonfuls of tapioca to soak in cold 
water ; set it on the stove, and, when thoroughly dissolved, pour in a 
quart of milk. When this begins to boil, stir in the yolks of two 
eggs well beaten, with a cup of sugar. When this boils stir in the 
whites, beaten to a stiff froth, and take it immediately from the fire. 
Flavor to taste. 

Lemon Cream. — One pint of cream, the yolks of two eggs, one 
quarter of a pound of white sugar, one large lemon, one ounce of 
isinglass ; put the cream into a lined saucepan, with the sugar, lemon- 
peel and isinglass, and simmer thfese over a gentle fire for about ten 
minutes, stirring them all the time; strain the cream into a jug, add 
the yolks of eggs, which should be well beaten, and put the jug into 
a saucepan of boiling water; stir the mixture one way until it thickens, 
but do not allow it to boil ; take it off the fire, and keep stirring it 
until nearly cold; strain the lemon-juice into a basin, gradually pour 
on it the cream, and stir it well until the juice is well mixed with it; 
have ready a well-oiled mould ; pour the cream into it, and let it re- 
main until perfectly set. When required for table, loosen the edges 
with a small blunt knife ; put a dish on the top of the mould, turn it 
over quickly, and the cream should easily slip away ; it will require 
ten minutes to boil the cream ; about ten minutes to stir it over the 
fire in a jug. 

Economical Lemon Cream. — One quart of milk, eight bitter 
almonds, two ounces of gelatine, two large lemons, three-quarters of 
a pound of lump-sugar, the yolks of six eggs ; put the milk into a 
lined saucepan, with the almonds, which should be well pounded in 
a mortar, the gelatine, lemon-rind and lump-sugar, and boil these 
ingredients for about five minutes ; beat up the yolks of the eggs, 
strain the milk into a jug, add the eggs, and pour the mixture back- 
ward and forward a few times, until nearly cold ; then stir briskly to 
it the lemon-juice, which should be strained, and keep stirring until 
the cream is almost cold ; put it into an oiled mould and let it remain 



488 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

until perlectly set. The lemon-juice must not be added to the 
cream when it is warm, and should be kept well stirred after it is 
put in. 

Whipped Cream. — Whips to be light must be quickly and lightly 
whisked, and as the froth rises, carefully skimmed off with a spoon 
and laid on a reversed sieve. Half a pint of cream, half a glass of 
sherry, the juice of half a lemon and a little sifted sugar — these, 
added by little at a time, make sufficient whip to cover an ordinary 
trifle dish. 

Orange Cream (i). — One ounce of isinglass, six large oranges, 
one lemon, sugar to taste, water, half a pint of good cream. Squeeze 
the juice from the oranges and lemon; strain it and put it into a sauce- 
pan with the isinglass and sufficient water to make in all one pint and 
a half Rub the sugar on the orange and lemon-rind, add to it the 
other ingredients, and boil all together for about ten minutes. Strain 
through a muslin bag, and, when cold, beat up with it half a pint of 
thick cream. Wet a mould or. soak it in cold water ; pour in the 
cream, and put it in a cool place to set. If the weather is very cold, 
one ounce of isinglass will be found sufficient for the above proportion 
of ingredients. Time: Ten minutes to boil the juice and water. 

Orange Cream (2). — One Seville orange, one tablespoonful of 
brandy, quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar, the yolks of four eggs, one 
pint of cream. Boil the rind of the Seville orange until tender, and 
beat it in a mortar to a pulp ; add to it the brandy, the strained juice 
of the orange and the sugar, and beat all together for about ten min- 
utes, adding the well-beaten yolks of eggs. Bring the cream to the 
boiling-point, and pour it very gradually to the othar ingredients, and 
beat the mixture till nearly cold ; put it into custard-cups, place the 
cups in a deep dish of boiling water, where let them remain till quite 
cold. Take the cups out of the water, wipe them, and garnish the 
tops of the cream with candied orange-peel or preserved chips. 

Ice-cream. — The best ice-cream is made simply of cream, sweet- 
ened, flavored with lemon-juice, or other extracts, if preferred, and 
frozen. Where cream cannot be procured, make a custard. One

ful of baking powder, and a very small pinch of salt, and sift them 
together ; beat the yolks of four eggs light ; beat into them six ounces 
of pulverized sugar; beat the whites of your four eggs light, and add 
the flour and whites of egg, a tablespoonful at a time, to the sugar 
and yolks ; put a sheet of well-buttered paper in a baking-pan, drop 
your cake into small oblong forms on it, and bake to a light-brown 
in a quick oven ; grate two ounces of chocolate, add to it four ounces 
of pulverized sugar, moisten it with cold water, mix smooth in a tin 
■ and set in a pot of hot water on the fire ; let it boil until it candies ; 
put it while hot on under part of the cakes, and put them two and 
two together ; then put the chocolate on top of each two, and put 
them for a few moments in the oven to dry. 

Cream for Filling. — One cup of sugar, juice and grated rind of 
two lemons, two eggs ; boil in a farina-kettle until it thickens. 

Jelly of Irish Moss. — Irish moss, half an ounce ; fresh milk, a 
pint and a half; boil down to a pint ; remove any sediment by strain- 
ing, and add the proper quantity of sugar and lemon-juice or peach 
water to give it an agreeable flavor. 

To Clarify Sugar for Water-ices. — Use six pounds of sugar, 
iix pints of water and the white of an egg ; melt the sugar in the 
•water, and place over a gentle fire ; let it boil well ; beat the white 
of an egg, and add it to the water; boil ten minutes, strain and 
bottle for use. 

To Make Fruit Water-ices. — To every pint of fruit-juice allow 
one pint of syrup ; select nice ripe fruit ; pick off the stalks, and put 
it into a large earthen pan, with a little pounded sugar strewed over ; 
stir it about with a wooden spoon until it is well broken, then rub it 
through a hair-sieve ; make the syrup, let it cool, add the fruit-juice, 
mix well together, and put the mixture into the freezing-pot ; when 
the mixture is equally frozen, put it into small glasses. Raspberry, 
strawberry, currant and other fresh fruit water-ices are made in the 
same manner. 

Lemon Ice. — Six lemons, juice of all, and grated peel of three; 
one large sweet orange, juice and rind, one pint pf water, one pint of 



COOKERY RECIPES. 49 1 

sugar; squeeze out every drop of juice and steep it in the rind of 
orange and lemons one hour ; strain, squeezing the bag dry ; mix in 
the sugar and then the water; stir until dissolved, and freeze by 
turning in a freezer, opening three times to beat all up together. 

Orange Ice. — Six oranges, juice of all, and grated peel of three ; 
two lemons, the juice only; one pint of sugar dissolved in one pint of 
water. Prepare and freeze as you would lemon ice. 

Pineapple Ice. — One juicy, ripe pineapple, peeled and cut small; 
juice and grated peel of one lemon, one pint of sugar, one pint of 
water, or less ; strew the sugar over the pineapple, and let it stand 
an hour ; mash all up together, and strain out the syrup through a 
hair-sieve ; add the water and freeze. 

Lemon Water-ice. — To every pint of syrup allow one-third pint 
of lemon-juice; the rind of four lemons; rub the sugar on the rinds 
of the lemons, and with it make a syrup ; strain the lemon-juice, add 
to it the other ingredients, stir well, and put the mixture into a freez- 
ing-pot. Freeze it, and when the mixture is thoroughly and equally 
frozen, put it into ice-glasses. 

Orange Jelly Moulded with Slices of Orange. — Use one pint 
and a half of orange jelly, four oranges, one-half pint of clarified 
syrup ; boil one-half pound of loaf-sugar with one-half pint of water 
until there is no scum left (which must be carefully removed as fast 
as it rises), and carefully peel the oranges ; divide them into thin slices 
without breaking the thin skin, and put these pieces of orange into 
the syrup, where let them remain for about five minutes ; then take 
them out, and use the syrup for the jelly ; when the oranges are well 
drained, and the jelly is nearly cold, pour a little of the latter into 
the bottom of the mould ; then lay in a few pieces of orange ; over 
these pour a little jelly, and when this is set, place another layer of 
oranges, proceeding in this manner until the mould is full ; put it in 
ice, or in a cool place, and before turning it out, wrap a cloth round 
the mould for a minute or two, which has been wrung in boiling 
water. Sufficient with the slices of orange to fill a quart mould. 

A Pretty Dish of Oranges, — Six large oranges, one-half pound 



492 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

of loaf-sugar, one-quarter pint of water, one-half pint of cream, two 
tablespoonfuls of any kind of liquor ; sugar to taste. Put the sugar 
and water into a saucepan, and boil them until the sugar becomes 
brittle, which may be ascertained by taking up a small quantity in a 
spoon and dipping it into cold water ; if the sugar is sufficiently boiled 
it will easily snap; peel the oranges; remove as much of the white 
pith as possible, and divide them into nice-sized slices without break- 
ing the thin white skin which surrounds the juicy pulp; place the 
pieces of orange on small skewers, dip them into hot sugar, and 
arrange them in layers round a plain mould, which should be well 
oiled with the purest salad oil. The sides of the mould only should 
be lined with the oranges, and the centre left open for the cream. 
Let the sugar become firm by cooling ; turn the oranges carefully out 
on a dish, and fill the centre with whipped cream, flavored with any 
kind of liquor, and sweetened with pounded sugar. This is an ex 
ceedingly ornamental and nice dish for the supper-table. 

Apple Trifle. — Scald as many apples as, when pulped, will cover 
the dish you design to use to the depth of two or three inches. Be- 
fore you place them in the dish, add to them the rind of half a lemon, 
grated fine, and sugar to taste ; mix half a pint of milk, half a pint 
of cream, and the yolk of an egg ; scald it over the fire, keeping i\ 
stirring, and do not let it boil ; add a little sugar, and let it stanc' 
till cold, then lay it over the apples, and finish with the cream whip. 

Ambrosia. — Peel some sweet oranges, slice them, and lay them in 
a glass dish with alternate layers of grated cocoanut and sugar to 
taste, putting a layer of cocoanut on the top, and pouring over the 
whole a full wineglass of good sherry. Place on the ice till needed, 
and serve very cold. 

Meringues. — Use one-half a pound of pounded sugar and the 
whites of four eggs. Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, 
and with a wooden spoon stir in quickly the pounded sugar ; and 
have some boards put in the oven thick enough to prevent the bottom 
of the meringues from acquiring too much color. Cut some strips 
of paper about two inches wide ; place this paper on the board and 



COOKERY RECIPES. 493 

drop a tablespoonful at a time of the mixture on the paper, taking 
care to let all the meringues be the same size. In dropping it from 
the spoon, give the mixture the form of an egg,' and keep the me- 
ringues about two inches apart from each other on the paper. Strew 
over them some sifted sugar, and bake in a moderate oven for one- 
half hour. As soon as they begin to color, remove them from the 
oven ; take each slip of paper by the two ends and turn it gently on 
the table, and, with a small spoon, take out the soft part of each 
meringue. Spread some clean paper on the board, turn the me- 
ringues upside down, and put them into the oven to harden and brown 
on the other side. When required for table, fill them with whipped 
cream, flavored with liqueur or vanilla, and sweeten with pounded 
sugar. Join two of the meringues together, and pile them high in 
the dish. To vary their appearance, finely-chopped almonds or cur- 
rants may be strewn over them before the sugar is sprinkled over ; 
and they may be garnished with any bright-colored preserve. Great 
expedition is necessary in making this sweet dish : as, if the me- 
ringues are not put into the oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are 
mixed, the former melts, and the mixture would run on the paper, 
instead of keeping its egg-shape. The sweeter the meringues are 
made, the crisper will they be ; but if there is not sufficient sugar 
mixed with them, they will most likely be tough. They are some- 
times colored with cochineal ; and, if kept well covered in a dry place, 
will remain good for a month or six weeks. 

Open Jelly, with Whipped Cream. — One and one-half pints of 
jelly, one-half pint of cream, one glass of sherry, sugar to taste. 
Make the above proportion of calf's-foot or isinglass jelly, coloring 
and flavoring it in any way that may be preferred ; soak a mould, open 
in the centre, for about one-half hour in cold water ; fill it with the 
jelly, and let it remain in a cool place until perfectly set ; then turn 
it out on a dish, fill the centre with whipped cream, flavored with 
sherry and sweetened with pounded sugar ; pile this cream high in 
the centre and serve. The jelly should be made of rather a dark 
color, to contrast nicely with the cream. Cook three-quarters of an 
hour. 



494 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

Blanc-Mange. — A quarter of a pound of sugar, one quart of milk, 
one ounce and a-half of isinglass, the rind of half a lemon, four laurel 
leaves. Put all the ingredients into a lined saucepan, and boil gently 
until the isinglass is dissolved ; taste it occasionally to ascertain when 
it is sufficiently flavored with the laurel leaves. Take them out, and 
keep stirring the mixture over the fire for about ten minutes. 
Strain it through a fine sieve into a jug, and, when nearly cold, pour 
it into a well-oiled mould, omitting the sediment at the bottom. 

Apple Charlotte. — Cut a sufficient number of thin slices of white 
bread to cover the bottom and line the sides of a baking dish, first 
rubbing it thickly with butter. Put thin slices of apples into the dish 
in layers till the dish is full, strewing sugar and bits of butter between. 
In the meantime, soak as many slices of bread as will cover the whole 
in warm milk, over which place a plate and a weight to keep the 
bread close upon the apples ; let it bake slowly for three hours. For 
a middling-sized dish, you should use half a pound of butter for the 
whole. 

Harlequin Jelly. — This pretty dish is produced in the following 
manner: Wash a jelly-mould with white of egg, melt a little currant 
jelly and pour into it ; let it cool ; when cold, melt some plum jelly 
and pour in ; let this cool ; melt crab-apple jelly, and so on, in layers 
of various colors till the mould is full. Care must be taken that the 
jellies are only warm enough to run, as, if they are hot, they will 
mix, and so spoil the effect. High-colored jellies and cream blanc- 
mange, moulded in layers in the same way, make a beautiful harlequin. 
Turn out when cold and stiff 

Baked Custard. — Beat seven eggs with three tablespoonfuls of 
rolled sugar ; when beaten to a froth, mix them with a quart of 
milk; flavor it with nutmeg; turn it into cups, or else into deep pie- 
plates that have a lining and rim of pastry ; bake quickly in a hot 
oven. 

Custard. — One quart of milk, four eggs ; sweeten with white 
sugar, a little salt ; put a teaspoonful of vanilla on the grated rind of a 
lemon ; pour it in cups, and set these cups in a dripping-pan which 



COOKERY RECIPES. 495 

has hot water enough in it to half cover the cups ; put it in a hot oven, 
and take it out as soon as the custard has thickened. 

Apple Custard. — Take half a dozen tart, mellow apples, pare and 
quarter them, and take out the cores ; put them in a pan, with half a 
teacup of water ; set them on a few coals ; when they begin to grow 
soft, turn them into a pudding-dish, and sprinkle sugar on them ; 
beat eight eggs with rolldd brown sugar ; mix them with three pints 
of milk ; grate in half a nutmeg, and turn the whole over the apples ; 
bake the custard between twenty and thirty minutes. 

Chocolate Custard. — One quart of milk and three ounces of choco- 
late, boiled together till thoroughly mixed ; then take off the fire and 
add four eggs well beaten in ; season to taste. 

Rice Custard. — Take one quart of milk, and thicken it while 
boiling with one large tablespoonful of ground rice. Beat five eggs, 
and pour them gradually into the milk. Let the custard boil a few 
minutes, and then add a little lemon-juice. 

Charlotte Russe. — Take three pints of rich cream, and sweeten 
it to suit the taste, then whip it to a stiff froth ; beat the yolks of four 
eggs, with a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar ; boil a vanilla-bean 
in a quart of water, and an ounce of isinglass until the latter is dis- 
solved ; strain this, boiling hot, on the sugar and eggs ; simmer a 
few minutes over the fire, but do not let it boil ; stir it to prevent 
curdling ; then set it away to cool ; when perfectly cool and it begins 
to stiffen, stir in the whips and put it in the moulds. Calf's-foot jelly 
can be used in place of the isinglass if desired. 

Floating Island. — Take a pint of thick cream, sweeten with fine 
sugar ; grate in the peel of one lemon, and add a gill of sweet white 
wine; whisk it well till you have raised a good froth, then pour a pint 
of thick cream into a china dish ; take one French roll, slice it thin, 
and lay it over the cream as lightly as possible ; then a layer of clear 
calf's-foot jelly or currant jelly ; then whip up your cream and lay 
on the froth as high as you can, and what remains pour into the bot- 
tom of the dish. Garnish the rim with sweetmeats. 

Cocoanut for Dessert. — Grate a cocoanut very nicely, adrf 
powdered sugar until very sweet ; serve with cream.

take one and one-half pounds of moist sugar, a teacup and a-half of 
water and one lemon ; boil the sugar, butter and water together with 
half the rind of the lemon, and when done, which will be known by 
dropping into cold water, when it should be quite crisp, let it stand 
aside till the boiling has ceased, and then stir in the juice of the 
lemon ; butter a dish, and pour it in about one-quarter of an inch 
thick. The fire must be quick and the candy stirred all the time.

them in a kettle of hot water over the fire. As the juice makes, pour 
it out ; put the juice in a kettle, boil and skim it, then put in the 
sugar (one pound of sugar to a pint of juice), stirring it all the while. 
As soon as it is dissolved it is done. 

Currant Jelly (2). — It should always be made during the first 
week in July. Pick the stems from the currants and put them in a 
kettle and heat them, mashing so as to express the juice ; then squeeze 
them through a huckaback towel. Add one pound of loaf-sugar to 
every pint of juice. Put it in a porcelain-lined kettle, and boil it 
thirty minutes after it begins to boil. 

Orange Jelly. — One pint of water, one and a half to two ounces 
of isinglass, half a pound of loaf-sugar, one Seville orange, one lemon, 
about nine China oranges. Put the water into a saucepan, with the 
isinglass, sugar and the rind of one orange, and the same of half a 
lemon, and stir these over the fire until the isinglass is dissolved, and 
remove the scum ; then add to this the juice of the Seville orange, 
the juice of the lemon, and sufficient juice of China oranges to make 
in all one pint ; from eight to ten oranges will yield the desired quan- 
tity. Stir all together over the fire until it is just on the point of 
boiling ; skim well ; then strain the jelly through a fine sieve or jelly- 
bag, and, when nearly cold, put it into a mould previously wetted, 
and, when quite set, turn it out on a dish and garnish it to taste. To 
insure this jelly being clear, the orange and lemon-juice should be 
well strained and the isinglass clarified before they are added to the 
other ingredients, and, to heighten the color, a few drops of prepared 
cochineal may be added. 

How TO Mould Bottled Jellies. — Uncork the bottle ; place it in 
a saucepan of hot water until the jelly is reduced to a liquid state. 
Taste it to ascertain whether it is sufficiently fllavored, and if not, 
add a little wine. Pour the jelly into moulds which have been 
soaked in water ; let it set, and turn it out by placing the mould in 
hot water for a minute ; then wipe the outside, put a dish on the 
top, and turn it over quickly. The jelly should then slip easily 



49^ THE HEARTHSTONE, OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

away from the mould and be quite firm. It may be garnished as taste 
dictates. 

Apple Jelly. — To every pound of apples add a pint of water, boil 
till all the goodness is extracted; then to every pint of juice add one 
pound of sugar; boil till reduced to half; then add a packet of gela- 
tine to each gallon, and the juice of four lemons. 

Jelly. — Two ounces of isinglass or gelatine, two quarts of water, 
one pound and a-half of sugar, whites of three eggs, beaten to a foam. 
Stir them all together cold; stand an hour; then put the juice of three 
lemons and peel of one ; lay in a short time. Boil fifteen minutes, 
and strain through a bag. 

A Very Simple and Easy Method of Making Very Superior 
Orange Wine. — Ninety Seville oranges, thirty-two pounds of lump- 
sugar, water. Break up the sugar into small pieces, and put it into a 
dry, sweet, nine-gallon cask, placed in a cellar or other storehouse, 
where it is intended to be kept. Have ready close to the cask two 
large pans or wooden keelers, into one of which put the peel of the 
oranges pared quite thin, and into the other the pulp after the juice 
has been squeezed from it. Strain the juice through a piece of double 
muslin, and put it in the cask with the sugar. Then pour about one 
and one-half gallons of cold spring-water on both the peels and pulp; 
let it stand for twenty-four hours, and then strain it into the cask ; 
add more water to the peels and pulp when this is done, and repeat the 
same process every day for a week ; it should take about a week to fill 
up the cask. Be careful to apportion the quantity as nearly as possible 
to the seven days, and to stir the contents of the cask each day. On 
the third day after the cask is full — that is, the tenth day after the 
commencement of making — the cask may be securely bunged down. 
This is a very simple and easy method, and the wine made according 
to it will be pronounced to be most excellent. There is no trouble- 
some boiling, and all fermentation takes place in the cask. When 
the above directions are attended to, the wine cannot fail to be good. 
It should be bottled in eight or nine months, and will be fit for use 
in a twelve-month after the time of making. Ginger wine may be

nade in precisely the same manner, only, with the nine-gallon cask 
for ginger win,e, two pounds of the best whole ginger, bruised, must 
be put with the sugar. It will be found convenient to tie the ginger 
loosely in a muslin bag. 

Lemon Syrup. — Two pounds of loaf-sugar, two pints of water, one 
ounce of citric acid, one-half drachm of essence of lemon. Boil the 
sugar and water together for one-quarter hour, and put it into a basin, 
where let it remain till cold. Beat the citric acid to a powder, mix 
the essence of lemon with it, then add these two ingredients to the 
syrup; mix well and bottle for use. Two tablespoonfuls of the syrup 
are sufficient for a tumbler of cold water, and will be found a very 
refreshing summer drink. 

For a Summer Draught. — The juice of one lemon, a tumblerful 
of cold water, pounded sugar to taste, one-half teaspoonful of car- 
bonate of soda. Squeeze the juice from the lemon ; strain and add it 
to the water, with sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole 
nicely. When well mixed, put in the soda ; stir well, and drink 
while the mixture is in an effervescing state. 

Currant Wine. — To one gallon and a quart of juice add two gal- 
lons of water and thirteen pounds of brown sugar. Mash and strain 
the currants through a sifter, and after mixing the preparations, put 
it in a vessel that is not too close for ten days, and then close it 
tightly until fall. After that time it can be drawn off and bottled. 

Recipe for Making Blackberry Wine. — To one gallon of ripe 
blackberries add one gallon of boiling water ; let it remain twenty- 
four hours; then strain without pressure, and to every gallon of juice 
add two and a-half pounds of loaf-sugar. Put in a demijohn, with a 
thin muslin cloth tied over the mouth; let it stand in a cool place for 
two months, then strain through flannel ; add one ounce of sugar to 
each gallon to clear it. Then bottle, and in three weeks it is ready 
for use. 

Elderberry Wine. — Take one quart of pure elderberry juice, two 
quarts water, three pounds sugar (the best sugar for this purpose is 
what we call molasses-sugar, viz. : sugar that settles from molasses 



500 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

into the bottom of hogsheads) ; mix all together, and let it ferment 
until it works itself clear ; strain and bottle ; leave the bottles un- 
corked until it is done working, then cork and put away in a cellar, 
and in a few months you will have good wine, but age will improve 

it. 

PRESERVES, CANNED FRUITS, Etc. 

To Preserve Fruit. — Fruit may be preserved with honey by 
putting the fruit first in the can, then pour the honey over it, and 
seal air-tight. When the honey is poured from the fruit it will have 
the flavor and appearance of jelly, making a rich dessert. 

To Preserve Pears. — Take small, rich, fair fruit, as soon as the 
pips are black ; set it over the fire in a kettle, with water to cover 
them ; let them simmer until they yield to the pressure of the finger; 
then, with a skimmer, remove them to cold water ; pare them neatly, 
leaving on a little of the stem and the blossom end. Pierce them at 
the blossom end to the core ; then make a syrup of a pound of sugar 
for each pound of fruit ; when it is boiling hot pour it over the pears, 
and let it stand until the next day. Then drain it off, making it boil- 
ing hot, and again pour it over. After a day or two put the fruit in 
the syrup over the fire, and boil gently until it is clear ; put it in the 
jars or spread it on dishes ; boil the syrup thick, then put it and the 
fruit in jars. 

Stewed Pears. — If small and ripe, cut out the blossom end with- 
out paring or coring ; put into a sauce-pan, with water enough to 
cover them, and stew until tender; add one-half cup of sugar for 
every quart of pears, and stew all together ten minutes ; take out the 
pears and lay them in a covered bowl to keep warm ; add to the syrup 
a little ginger or a few cloves ; boil fifteen minutes longer, and pour 
over the fruit hot. 

Watermelon Preserves. — Peel the shell or skin off; cutting in 
any sized pieces. Lay in alum-water over night, then take out and 
drain. Use a pound of rind to a pound of sugar in preserving, unless 
you can the fruit, then it does not require near as much sugar, and 
makes a very nice sauce to be eaten with cream. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 50I 

Preserved Orange-Peel. — Weigh the oranges whole, and allow 
pound to pound ; peel the oranges neatly, and cut the rinds into 
narrow shreds ; boil till tender, changing the water twice, replenish- 
ing with hot from the tea-kettle ; squeeze the strained juice of the 
oranges over the sugar ; let this heat to a boil. Put in the shreds, 
and boil twenty minutes. Lemon-peel can be preserved in the same 
way, only allowing more sugar. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Allow pound to pound sugar and 
fruit; put in a preserving kettle together over a slow fire till the 
sugar melts ; boil twenty-five minutes fast. Take out the fruit in a 
perforated skimmer, and fill your jars three-fourths full. Boil and 
skim the syrup five minutes more, pour it over the fruit, filling the 
jars, and seal up while hot. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

To Preserve Grapes (i). — Procure some tin cases of any con- 
venient size, and put in a layer of dry sand or charcoal, and then a 
bunch of grapes until the case is full ; seal down the lid and make them 
air-tight, and bury them to any convenient depth in the ground. 

To Preserve Grapes (2). — First, pick off all unsound or unripe 
ones, and lay the clusters in an empty room on papers until dry, for in 
all packages some will be crushed and dampen others ; then in the 
crate place first a layer of grapes, then a thickness of paper, so as to 
exclude the air and keep them separate ; then grapes and then paper, 
and so on until you have three or four layers, and no more than four. 
If the box is to hold more, put in a partition to support the others 
that are to be packed. 

Preserved Grapes in Bunches. — Take out the stones from the 
bunches with a pin, breaking them as little as possible ; boil some 
clarified sugar to nearly candying point ; then put in sufficient grapes 
to cover the bottom of the preserving kettle, without laying them on 
each other, and boil for nearly five minutes, merely to extract all the 
juice; lay them in an earthen pan and pour the syrup over them; 
cover with paper, and the next dAy boil the syrup, skimming it well, 
for five minutes ; put in the grapes, let them boil a minute or two ; 
put them in pots, and pour the syrup over them, after which tie 
down. 



502 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Preserving Grapes with Honey. — Take seven pounds of sound 
grapes on the stems, have the branches as perfect as possible, and 
pack them snugly, without breaking, in a stout jar. Make a syrup of 
four pounds of honey and one pint of vinegar, with cloves and cinna- 
mon to suit, or about three ounces of each as a rule. Boil them well 
together for twenty minutes, and skim well, then turn while boiling 
hot over the grapes, and seal immediately. They will keep for 
years, and are exceedingly nice. Apples, peaches and plums may be 
preserved in the same way. 

Grapes Preserved in Pumpkins. — The Chinese have a method of 
preserving grapes so as to have them at hand during the entire year, 
by cutting a circular piece out of a ripe pumpkin, or gourd, making 
an aperture large enough to admit the hand. The interior is then 
completely cleaned out, the ripe grapes are then placed inside, and 
the cover replaced and pressed in firmly. The pumpkins are then 
kept in a cool place, and the grapes will be found to retain their fresh- 
ness for a very long time. 

Peaches Preserved in Brandy. — To every pound of fruit, weighed 
before being stoned, allow one-quarter pound of finely pounded loaf- 
sugar ; brandy. Let the fruit be gathered in dry weather ; wipe and 
weigh it, and remove the stones as carefully as possible, without in- 
juring the peaches much. Put them into a jar, sprinkle amongst 
them pounded loaf-sugar in the above proportion, and pour brandy 
over the fruit. Cover the jar down closely, place it in a saucepan 
of boiling water over the fire, and bring the brandy to the simmering- 
point, but do not allow it to boil. Take the fruit out carefully with- 
out breaking it ; put it into small jars, pour over it the brandy, and, 
when cold, exclude the air by covering the jars with bladders, or 
tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg. 
Apricots may be done in the same manner, and, if properly prepared, 
will be found delicious. Time : From ten to twenty minutes to bring 
the brandy to the simmering-point. 

To Preserve Oranges. — Take those that are perfectly fresh, and 
wrap separately in soft papers ; put them in glass jars or very light 



COOKERY RECIPES. 5O3 

boxes, with white sand ; let the sand be well dried ; put the sand in 
so that the fruit will not touch each other ; close the jar tight, and 
put it in a cool, dry place, but where the fruit will not freeze. Lemons 
may be preserved in the same way. 

Raspberry I^ily. — Boil rice so that the kernels will be as distinct 
as possible ; spread a spoonful upon a dessert-plate ; cover it all but 
the edges with ripe raspberries ; pour over it two spoonfuls of sweet- 
ened strawberry or raspberry juice; sprinkle over the whole some 
white sugar, and serve cold. 

Drying Fruit. — Commence as soon as fully mature. If large 
quantities are to be preserved in this way, it will pay to get a fruit- 
drier of some kind, but as most private families only dry enough for 
home use, the common method is to employ the heat of the sun. 
Where there are hot-bed sashes, these may be used to great advan- 
tage. A frame raised a foot or so from the ground upon legs, and 
covered with sashes, will dry fruit and vegetables rapidly and cheaply. 
Make ventilating holes and cover with gauze. 

Dried Apples. — A bushel of fresh apples, weighing about fifty 
pounds, will furnish about seven pounds of good dried fruit; or, if 
the cores are not cut out or the skins removed, there will be nine 
dried pounds. There is, consequently, about eighty-two per cent, of 
water in the apples. Fruits generally have eighty-five per cent, of 
water. 

A Nice Way to Bake Apples. — Take sour apples ; remove the 
cores ; place the apples in a deep dish or tin, fill the cavities where 
the cores came out with sugar, pour a cup of hot water in the tin ; 
bake in a quick oven. 

Apple Custard. — A pint of stewed apples, a pint of milk, yolks of 
three eggs, juice and rind of half a lemon, juice of small orange; 
sugar to taste. Beat well together ; bake, and, when done, whisk 
the whites with a little sugar, and spread over the top. Brown in a 
quick oven. 

Sealed Apples. — Pare and core your apples, and then place them 
in an earthen pipkin or stone jar; if juicy, they will need no water; 



504 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

put a little bread-paste inside the rim of the jar, and crowd the covei 
down into it ; then put it into a very slow oven until thoroughly cooked, 
which will require two or three hours, according to the heat of the 
oven. Experience only can decide the requisite amount of cooking 
in this as in many other things. The reason for sealing them is, that 
the aroma of the fruit is thus all preserved. 

Apples may be kept till June by taking sound ones, and, after 
wiping each apple perfectly dry and clean, pack them in tight barrels, 
with a layer of bran to each layer of apples ; envelop the barrel in a 
linen cloth to keep the frost out, and keep it in a cool place. 

Quinces. — To one pound of sugar and one pound of fruit put a 
pint of water, and put them all in the kettle together, and let them 
boil as fast as possible, without burning, and so that a constant foam 
will cover the fruit. In twenty minutes they are done. 

Canning Fruit. — -The process is very simple. Place a clean and 
very wet towel in a pan, away from currents of air , set the can to be 
filled on the towel ; put a silver spoon in it ; then set the fruit-funnel 
in and pour in the boiling fruit. Remove the funnel and spoon, fill 
the can to the very top, and seal tightly. Then, when nearly cold 
give the screw ring, if possible, another turn, or part of a turn. 
Stand the cans upside down to make sure that they are tight. If 
Ihe syrup get out the air cannot get in, and the fruit will keep. 

Jam. — The best of jam is made of an equal quantity of gooseberriej 
and raspberries. Two or more of any kinds of berries or of fruit, 
make better jam mixed than when used singly. Boiling fruit a long 
time and skimming it well, without the sugar, and without a cover to 
the preserving-pan, is a very economical and excellent way of pre- 
serving — economical, because the bulk of the scum rises from the 
fruit, and not from the sugar, if the latter is good ; and boiling it with- 
out a cover allows the evaporation of the watery particles therefrom, 
and the preserves keep firm and well-flavored. The proportions are 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Jam made of 
any kind of berries in this way is excellent. 

Cherry Jam. — To every pound of fruit weighed before stoning. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 5O5 

allow one-half pound of sugar ; to every six pounds of fruit allow one 
pint of red currant-juice, and to every pint of juice one pound of 
sugar. Weigh the fruit before stoning, and allow half the weight of 
sugar ; stone the cherries, and boil them in a preserving-pan until 
nearly all the juice is dried up; then add the sugar, which should be 
crushed to powder, and the currant-juice, allowing one pint to every 
six pounds of cherries (original weight), and one pound of sugar to 
every pint of juice. Boil all together until it jellies, which will be in 
from twenty minutes to one-half hour ; skim the jam well, keep it 
well stirred, and, a few minutes before it is done, crack some of the 
stones and add the kernels ; these impart a very delicious flavor to 
the jam. Time — according to the quality of the cherries, from three- 
quarters to one hour to boil them ; twenty minutes to one-half hour 
with the sugar. 

Raspberry Jam. — Use three-fourths of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of fruit. Put the fruit on alone, or with the addition of one 
pint of currant-juice to every four pounds of raspberries. Boil half 
an hour, mashing and stirring well ; add the sugar, and cook twenty 
minutes more. Blackberry jam is very good made in the same way, 
only omitting the currant-juice. 

Orange Marmalade [superior). — To one pound of crushed sugar 
allow one pound of oranges, with the rinds. Then pour off the yel- 
low rind of half the oranges, and put it over the fire in cold water ; 
cover very tight and simmer till tender ; grate the yellow rind of the 
remaining oranges, and set aside ; quarter the oranges, and squeeze 
out all the juice and pulp, removing all the seeds and white skin. 
Put the sugar in the kettle, and to each pound add one pint of cold 
water ; allow the white of one egg to every two pounds of sugar. 
When the sugar is all dissolved, put it over the fire, let it boil, and 
skim till quite clear and thick ; take the boiled parings and pound to 
a paste in a mortar ; put this in the syrup, boil and stir ten minutes, 
then add the pulp, juice and grated rind ; boil all together for half an 
hour, till it is a transparent mass. Lemons may be prepared in the 

same way, but require more sugar.

THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 



Brandy Pineapple. — Cut your pines in thin slices ; four pounds of 
fruit to three pounds of sugar ; lay the sugar in between the slices, 
and pour one pint of white brandy over them. 

MouLDiNESS. — Preserves and jellies may be kept from mouldiness 
by covering the surface with pulverized loaf-sugar. Thus protected 
they will keep for years.

Fruit Flavoring. — Below are instructions by which all con- 
fectioners may extract and preserve their own fruit essences, and 
so guard the health and add to the pleasure of all for whom they 
provide. Among the juicy fruits are strawberries, raspberries, black- 
berries, cherries and currants; among non-juicy fruits are the apple, 
pears, peaches, quinces, apricots and plums. 

Mash the juicy fruits in a basin to a pulp. Place on the fire 
and make -scalding hot. Now pour into a hair-sieve and allow the 
juice to strain through. Put into bottles and securely tie down. 
Place these bottles in a cauldron of cold water and boil for twenty. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 5O7 

minutes. Remove from the fire and allow to remain in the cauldron 
until cold. Then set away for use. 

In the case of non-juicy fruits, such as apples, pears, peaches, 
etc., put the fruit into a basin. Cover with water and boil to a 
pulp. Now place on a hair-sieve and allow to drain without any 
pressing. Observe now that it is only the liquor which passes 
through the sieve without pressing which is to be used for flavoring 
purposes. What remains in the form of pulp is not adapted for 
these uses. Now put the juice obtained as above into bottles, and 
proceed to treat as already laid down for the juicy fruits. 

The foregoing processes are to be gone through with in the case 
where the extracts are to be kept transparent and clear, as for 
syrups, cordials, and beverages. 

In case where the flavorings are to be used for any purpose 
where transparency or clearness is not desirable, such as for ice- 
creams, fruit-ices, or bonbons, use not only the clear fluid, but the 
pulp of the fruit also. For these opaque purposes save and utilize 
everything of the fruit except the skins and seeds. This pulp to be 
treated as already laid down. 

As thus obtained and preserved our confectioners can supply them- 
selves with a quantity of perfectly pure extracts of all their favorite 
fruits, and which can always be at hand for flavoring every descrip- 
tion of pastry, cakes, pies, tarts, puddings, creams, ices, and bever- 
ages, and at any season of the year. Especially when there is any 
one in the house who is sick or feverish, cordials may be flavored 
with these delightful sub-acids — these remedies and restoratives of 
kind mother Nature herself — such as will shoot through all the veins 
of the most debilitated and infirm the most delicious sensations of 
happiness and hope. 

Initials on Fruit. — Did you ever see a name printed on a grow- 
ing apple, pear, or peach ? No ! Well, if you wish to have that 
pleasure, this is the way to obtain it : While the fruit yet hangs green 
upon the tree, make up your mind which is the very biggest and 
niost promising specimen of all. Next, cut from thin, brown paper 



508 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOMK. 

the initials of the name of your little brother or sister or chief crony, 
with round specks for the dots after the letters, and the letters them- 
selves plain and thick. Then paste these letters and dots on that 
side of the apple which is most turned toward the sun, taking care 
not to loosen the fruit's hold upon its stem. As soon as the apple 
is ripe, take off the paper cuttings, which, having shut out the red- 
dening rays of the sun, have kept the fruit green just beneath them, 
so that the name or initials now show plainly. After that, bring the 
owner of the name to play beneath the tree, and say presently : 
" Why, what are those queer marks on that apple up there ! " You 
will find this quite a pleasant way to surprise the very little ones, 
and, of course, you can print a short, pet name as easily as initials. 

A Good Dessert. — Half a pound or more of grapes, taken as a 
" dessert " half an hour before the two or three regular meals of the 
day, with nothing whatever between, will, in a few days, remove a 
great variety of symptoms : those, for example, which result from 
biliousness, such as bad taste in the mouth of mornings, aversion to 
meats, sleepiness, indisposition to exercise, indifference, dullness, 
headache, cold feet, confined condition of the system, depression of 
spirits and chilliness. The immediate cause of all the discomfort 
is a " confined " condition of the system ; the seeds of the grapes act 
as an irritant and dissolve the solid matter contained in the intestines, 
while the acidity of the grapes relieves the system of bile. The 
covering of the grapes should not be swallowed. 

A Garnish for Sweet Dishes. — A few dried or preserved cher 
ries, with stones out, are the very best thing possible to garnish 
sweet dishes. 

PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

To Pickle Lemons with the Peel on. — Six lemons, two quarts 
of boiling water; to each quart of vinegar allow half an ounce of 
cloves, half an ounce of white pepper, one ounce of bruised ginger, a 
quarter-ounce of mace and chilies, one ounce of mustard-seed, half a 
stick of shced horseradish, a few cloves of garUc. Put the lemons 
into a brine that will bear an egg ; let them remain in it six days, 



COOKERY RECIPES. JOp 

stirring them every day ; have ready two quarts of boiling water, put 
in the lemons, and allow them to boil for a quarter of an hour ; take 
them out, and let them lie in a cloth until perfectly dry and cold. 
Boil up sufficient vinegar to cover the lemons, with all the above 
ingredients, allowing the same proportion as stated to each quart of 
vinegar. Pack the lemons in a jar, pour over the vinegar, etc., boil- 
ing hot, and tie down with a bladder. They will be fit for use in 
about twelve months, or rather sooner. 

To Pickle Lemons without the Peel. — Six lemons, one pound 
of fine salt ; to each quart of vinegar, the same ingredients as above. 
Peel the lemons, slit each one down three times, so as not to divide 
them, and rub the salt well into the divisions. Place them in a pan, 
where they must remain for a week, turning them every other day ; 
then put them in a Dutch oven before a clear fire until the salt has 
become perfectly dry; then arrange them in a jar; pour over sufficient 
boiling vinegar to cover them, to which have been added the ingre- 
dients mentioned in the foregoing recipe ; tie down closely, and in 
about nine months they will be fit for use. 

Knickerbocker Pickle. — For beef, mutton and pork. Six gallons 
of spring water, nine pounds of salt (one-half coarse, two and a-half 
fine), six pounds of coarse brown sugar, one quart of molasses, three 
ounces of saltpetre, one ounce of pearl-ash. Boil well and skim care- 
fully. When cold, pour over the meat previously packed in a barrel. 
This quantity will answer for one hundred pounds of meat. 

To Pickle Green Tomatoes. — One gallon of sliced green toma- 
toes, eight onions sliced ; salt them and let them stand over night ; in 
the morning drain them well ; take one tablespoonful of black pepper, 
one tablespoonful of allspice, two tablespoonfuls of cloves, three table- 
spoonfuls of mustard — all ground ; one-half pint of mustard-seed, one- 
half pint of grated horseradish, six green peppers, cut fine ; mix them 
well with the tomatoes and onions, and pour three pints of boiling 
vinegar on. 

To Pickle Red Tomatoes. — Prick the tomatoes with a fork, put 
them in strong brine for eight days, then put them in vinegar twenty- 



5IO THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

four hours ; to a peck of tomatoes add a bottle of mustard, one ounce 
of cloves, one ounce of ground pepper, one dozen large onions, sliced ; 
laying alternately a layer of tomatoes, spice and onions ; pour strong 
vinegar, cold, over them. 

Indian or Yellow Pickle (Mrs. Reynolds' recipe). — One gallon 
best white-wine vinegar, one ounce of black pepper, one ounce of 
white pepper, one ounce of long pepper, one ounce of ginger, one 
ounce of cloves, one ounce of mustard-seed, one ounce of cayenne, 
one ounce of turmeric. Boil all together; let it stand till cold; salt 
and dry everything as it comes in season, and put it in the pickle ; 
then put plenty of horseradish and garlic — if you like it — but do not 
boil that. The cauliflower and cow-cabbage are best in autumn ; put 
no walnuts or onions in. 

Mangoes. — Muskmelons should be picked for mangoes when they 
are green and hard. They should be cut open after they have been 
in salt water ten days, the inside scraped out clean, and filled with 
mustard-seed,' allspice, horseradish, small onions, etc., and sewed up 
again. Scalding vinegar poured upon them. 

Mushrooms. — Peel and stew them with just water enough to pre- 
vent their sticking at the bottom of the pan. Shake them occasion- 
ally, to prevent their burning. When tender, take them up and put 
them in scalding-hot vinegar, spiced with mace, cloves and pepper- 
corns ; add a little salt. Cork them tight in bottles if you wish to 
keep them long. 

Onion and Cucumber Pickles. — To every dozen of cucumbers 
put three large onions; cut both in thick slices, and sprinkle salt 
over them. Next day drain them for five or six hours ; then put 
them into a stone jar ; pour boiling vinegar over them, and keep them 
in a warm place ; repeat the boiling vinegar, and stop them up again 
instantly, and so on till green; the last time put in pepper and 
ginger ; keep in stone jars. The vinegar will be found very good for 
winter-salads. 

To Pickle Gherkins. — Put them in strong brine ; keep them in a 
warm place. When they turn yellow, drain off the brine and turn 



COOKERY RECIPES. 51 1 

hot vinegar on them. Let them remain in it till they turn green, 
keeping them in a warm place. Then turn off the vinegar — add fresh 
scalding-hot vinegar, spiced with mace, allspice and peppercorns ; add 
alum and salt in the same proportion as for cucumbers. 

Nasturtiums. — Take them, when small and green, put them in salt 
and water ; change the water once in three days. When you have 
done collecting the nasturtiums, turn off the brine and pour on 
scalding-hot vinegar. Put them in bottles and seal them. They are 
delightful seasoning for other pickles. 

Pickled Grapes. — Seven pounds of ripe grapes, picked from 
the stems, and boiled until the skins will pass through a colander; 
three and a-half pounds of sugar, one-half pint of vinegar, one ounce 
each of whole cloves, cinnamon and allspice; all boiled together 
until it jellies. Put in glasses, and turn out in form. These pickles 
are especially nice for the tea-table. 

To Pickle Peaches (i). — Fill a stone jar with peaches, sticking 
cloves into each one, and rubbing off the skin with a towel ; or, by 
throwing the fruit into boiling water for two minutes, and then rub- 
bing off the skins; to eight pounds of fruit add four pounds of sugar, 
one quart of vinegar, and a little stick cinnamon ; make this mixture 
scalding hot, and, four mornings in succession, pour over the fruit, 
when it will be ready for use. 

To Pickle Peaches (2). — To seven pounds of peaches take one 
quart of vinegar, two pounds of sugar, mace and cloves ; make a 
syrup of the vinegar and sugar, and pour over the fruit boiling hot ; 
then stand the jar in a kettle of boiling water two or three hours. 

To Pickle Peaches (3). — Select ripe, but not soft peaches ; rub 
well with a cloth ; place them in a crock, and for each quart of vinegar 
add four pounds of sugar ; scald the vinegar and pour it over the 
peaches ; let them stand two or' three days ; then pour the vinegar 
from the peaches ; heat scalding hot, and pour over the peaches, and 
repeat this operation the third time ; season with stick cinnamon. 

Pickled Peppers. — Select the peppers, and then with a penknife 
cut half way round the stem end, removing the seeds with the knife 



512 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

or the fingers ; be carefiil to use the knife if there are any scratches 
on the hands, for in that case the sting would be very painful ; soak 
the peppers in strong brine for three days, then freshen in cold water 
twenty-four hours ; stuff with small onions, small cucumbers (which 
have been in brine for two days), mustard-seed and chopped cabbage, 
and sew up the slit ; then pack in stone jars and pour scalding vine- 
gar over them ; repeat the scalding two more times, then tie up and 
keep in a cool place. 

Pickled Onions. — One gallon of pickling onions, salt and water, 
milk ; to each half a gallon of vinegar, one ounce of bruised ginger, 
one-quarter teaspoonful of cayenne, one ounce of allspice, one ounce 
of whole black pepper, one-quarter ounce of whole nutmeg bruised, 
eight cloves, one-quarter ounce of mace. Gather the onions, which 
should not be too small, when they are quite dry and ripe ; wipe off 
the dirt, but do not pare them ; make a strong solution of salt and 
water, into which put the onions, and change this morning and night 
for three days, and save the last brine they are put in. Then take 
the outside skin off, and put them into a tin saucepan capable of hold- 
ing them all, as they are always better done together. Now take 
equal quantities of milk and the last salt and water the onions were 
in, and pour this to them ; to this add two large spoonfuls of salt, put 
them over the fire, and watch them very attentively. Keep con- 
stantly turning the onions about with a wooden skimmer, those at the 
bottom to the top, and vice versa ; and let the milk and water run 
through the holes of the skimmer. Remember the onions must never 
boil, for if they do they will be good for nothing ; and they should 
be quite transparent. Keep the onions stirred for a few minutes, and, 
in stirring them, be particular not to break them ; then have ready a 
pan with a colander, into which turn the onions to drain, covering 
them with a cloth to keep in the steam. Place on a table an old 
cloth, two or three times double ; put the onions on it when quite 
hot, and over them an old piece of blanket ; cover this closely over 
them to keep in the steam ; let them remain till the next day, when 
they will be quite cold, and look yellow and shrivelled ; take off the 



COOKERY RECIPES. 5I3 

shrivelled skins, when they should be as white as snow. Put them in 
a pan, make a pickle of vinegar and the remaining ifigredients ; boil 
all these up, and pour hot over the pan ; cover very closely to keep 
in all the steam, and let them stand till the following day, when they 
will be quite cold. Put them into jars and bottles well bunged, and 
a tablespoonful of the best olive-oil on the top of each jar or bottle. 
Tie them down with bladder, and let them stand in a cool place for 
a month or six weeks, when they will be fit for use. They should be 
beautifully white, and eat crisp, without the 'least softness, and will 
keep good many months. 

Spanish Onions — Pickled. — Onions, vinegar ; salt and cayenne to 
taste ; cut the onions in thin slices ; put a layer of them in the bottom 
of a jar ; sprinkle with salt and cayenne ; then add another layer of 
onions, and season as before; proceeding in this manner till the jar 
is full, pour in sufficient vinegar to cover the whole, and the pickle 
will be fit for use in a month. 

Pickled Plums (i). — Take damsons, wipe and prick them ; place 
them in ajar; to one gallon of vinegar put six pounds of brown sugar ; 
dilute the vinegar with water if it is too strong ; then pour it in a 
kettle and boil and skim it several times ; then pour the vinegar over 
the plums. 

Pickled Plums (2). — Four pounds of sugar to seven pounds of 
plums ; two ounces of stick cinnamon, one of cloves ; scald the vine- 
gar and pour it over the plums three mornings in succession. 

East India Pickle. — Chop one cabbage fine (leaving out the 
stalks), and with it, three or four onions, a root of horseradish, and a 
couple of green peppers. Spice some vinegar very strong with mace, 
cloves, allspice and cinnamon. Heat it scalding hot ; add alum and 
salt, and turn it on to the cabbage, onions and pepper, which should 
previously have all the brine drained from them. Fit for use in three 
weeks. 

English Pickles. — Put the cucumbers in brine strong enough to 
bear up a raw potato. Let them remain nine days ; then pour off the 
brine and scald it ; pour it on again, scalding hot ; cover closely. Do 



514 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

this every morning for three days ; then place them in cold, fresh 
water, and leave them over night; drain them, and place in stone jars, 
and put over them scraped horseradish, a handful of whole doves, 
one tablespoonful of whole allspice, a quart of nasturtiums, a teacup 
of mixed white mustard-seed, a teacup of black mustard-seed, an 
onion and five or six red peppers (whole). Scald the best cider vine- 
gar and pour it over the pickles, covering them tightly. In a few 
days they are fit for use. 

To Pickle Eggs. — Sixteen eggs, one quart of vinegar, half an 
ounce of black pepper, half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, half an ounce 
of ginger ; boil the eggs for twelve minutes ; then dip them into cold 
water, and take off the shells ; put the vinegar, with the pepper and 
ginger into a stewpan, and let it simmer for ten minutes ; now place 
the eggs in a jar, pour over them the vinegar, etc., boiling hot, and, 
when cold, tie them down with bladder to exclude the air. This 
pickle will be ready for use in a month. 

Universal Pickle. — To six quarts of vinegar allow one pound of 
salt, one-fourth pound of ginger, one ounce of mace, one-half pound 
of shallots, one tablespoonful of cayenne, two ounces of mustard-seed, 
one and a-half ounces of turmeric. Boil all the ingredients together 
for about twenty minutes ; when cold, put them into a jar with what- 
ever vegetables you choose, such as radish-pods, French beans, cauli- 
flowers, gherkins, etc., etc., as these come into season ; put them in 
fresh as you gather them, having previously wiped them perfectly 
free from moisture and grit. This pickle will be fit for use in about 
eight or nine months. 

A Tennessee Recipe for Tomato Catsup (i). — Take two quarts 
of skinned tomatoes, two tablespoonfuls of salt, two of black pepper, 
two of ground mustard, one of spice, and four pods of pepper ; mix 
and rub these well together, and stew them slowly in one pint of 
strong vinegar three hours ; strain through a sieve, and simmer down 
the liquid to one quart. Put this in a bottle and cork tightly. 

Tomato Catsup (2). — One and one-half gallons of tomatoes, eight 
tablespoonfuls of mustard-seed, bruised, four tablespoonfuls of black 



COOKERY RECIPES. §15 

pepper, four tablespoonfuls of salt, one-half tablespoonful of ground 
allspice, one-half tablespoonful of cayenne pepper; boil it four hours, 
putting in a little at a time of sharp vinegar, so as to have at the end 
of four hours one-half gallon of catsup ; pass it through a coarse sieve 
to strain out all but the rich pulp and spice. 

Tomato Catsup (3) — {Mrs. Reynolds' recipe). — The tomatoes 
should be perfectly ripe and sound ; scald and peel them ; to one 
gallon of tomatoes add one quart of sharp vinegar, four tablespoonfuls 
of fine salt, four of black pepper, one of allspice, whole, three of mus- 
tard and eight pods of red pepper ; the whole to be boiled three or 
four hours in a brass kettle, stirring frequently; when cold, rub 
through a wire sieve fine enough to catch the seeds. Bottle it. If a 
white scum rises in the necks of the bottles in a week or two, boil it 
a second time, and add a little vinegar. Seal the bottles. 

Tomato Catsup (4). — One gallon of ripe tomatoes with one quart 
of cider vinegar ; boil until quite soft ; then strain through a coarse 
iron sieve ; add four tablespoonfuls of salt, two of cloves, four (heap- 
ing full) of allspice, one of red pepper ; boil until half wasted ; then, 
with a skimmer, take out the spices and bottle tight when cold ; boil 
always in tin. If the corks are soaked in boiling water they will cork 
easier. 

Cucumber Catsup. — Grate large cucumbers before they begin to 
turn yellow ; drain out the juice, and put the pulp through a sieve to 
remove the large seeds ; fill a bottle half full of the pulp, discarding 
the juice, and add the same quantity of ten per cent, vinegar ; cork 
tightly ; when used, add pepper and salt ; salt kills the vinegar if put 
in when made. This is almost like fresh-sliced cucumber when 
opened for use. 

Walnut Catsup. — One hundred walnuts, one handful of salt, one 
quart of vinegar, one-quarter of an ounce of mace, one-quarter of an 
ounce of cloves, one-quarter of an ounce of ginger, one-quarter of an 
ounce of whole blaclc pepper, a small piece of horseradish, twenty 
shallots, one-quarter of a pound of anchovies, one pint of port wine ; 
procure the walnuts at a time when you can run a pin through them; 



5l6 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

slightly bruise, and put them into a jar with the salt and vinegar; let, 
them stand eight days, stirring every day ; then drain the liquor from 
them and boil it, with the above ingredients, for about half an hour ; 
it may be strained or not, as preferred, and, if required, a little more 
vinegar or wine can be added, according to taste. When bottled 
well, seal the corks. 

To Make Curry Powder. — One ounce each of ground ginger, 
mustard and pepper ; three of ground coriander seed, the same of 
turmeric, and half an ounce cardamon seeds, also ground, one-quarter 
ounce cayenne pepper, one-quarter ounce cinnamon, the same of 
cinnamon seed. If not all ground, pound all fine in a mortar, soft, 
and cork tightly in bottles. All these ingredients may readily be 
found at the druggists and grocers. The cost is less than of the 
curry powder which is to be bought " ready made." It is far superior 
in quality and little trouble to make. 

BREADS, BREAKFAST CAKES, Etc. 

The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost 
cleanliness ; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the 
ingredients used for it ; and, in addition to these, there must be atten- 
tion and care through the whole process. 

An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half made 
and to allow it to become cold before it is finished. The other most 
common causes of failure are using yeast which is no longer sweet, 
or which has been frozen, or has had hot liquid poured over it. 

Too small a proportion of yeast or insufficient time allowed for the 
dough to rise, will cause the bread to be heavy. 

Heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the 
dough very hard and letting it become quite cold, particularly in 
winter. 

If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself 
— that is to say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it 
has reached the proper point for either — sour bread will probably be 
the consequence in warm weather, and bad bread in any. The good 



COOKERY RECIPES. 517 

ness will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make 
any part of it hot, instead of maintaining the gentle and equal degree 
of heat required for its due fermentation. 

To keep bread sweet and fresh, as soon as it is cold it should be 
put into a clean earthen pot, with a cover to it ; this pot should be 
placed at a little distance from the ground, to allow a current of air 
to pass underneath. 

Some persons prefer keeping bread on clean wooden shelves, with- 
out being covered, that the crust may not soften. Stale bread may 
be freshened by warming it through in a gentle oven. Stale pastry, 
cakes, etc., may also be improved by this method. 

The utensils required for making bread, on a moderate scale, are a 
kneading-trough or pan, sufficiently large that the dough may be 
kneaded freely without throwing the flour over the edges, and also to 
allow for its rising ; a hair-sieve for straining yeast, and one or two 
strong spoons. 

As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather 
quick, and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without 
hardening the outside. The oven-door should not be opened after 
the bread is put in until the dough is set, or has become firm, as the 
cool air admitted will have an unfavorable effect on it. 

Mixed Breads. — Rye bread is hard of digestion, and requires 
longer and slower baking than wheaten bread. It is better when 
made with a leaven of wheaten flour rather than yeast, and turns out 
lighter. It should not be eaten till two days old. It will keep a 
long time. 

TopsY Bread (a German dish). — One quart of milk, mixed with 
two tablespoonfuls of flour and three or four eggs, small quantity of 
salt, stale baker's bread cut in slices ; dip the bread in the batter and 
soak it ; then take it out and fry it on a hot griddle with a very little 
lard ; turn it over and brown both sides alike ; eat with powdered 
sugar sprinkled over it. 

Brown Bread (i). — Three cups of corn-meal, two cups of rye 
flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of molasses ; stir with 
new milk. Bake three hours. 



JiS THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

Brown Bread (2). — Two cups of corn-meal, one of wheat flour, 
one of molasses, one teaspoonful of soda. Mix with either sweet or 
sour milk ; stir it as stiff as wheat griddle-cakes. Put it in some cov- 
ered vessel and boil in kettles of hot water four hours at least. It is 
better boiled longer. 

Graham Flour. — The miller in preparing fine flour extracts from 
it three-fourths of its nutritious matter, leaving only that which is 
found in gluten, or starch, and he also takes from it all the phosphate 
which makes bone, and all the matter which would regulate the 
digestive organs and purify the blood, and leaves the pure wheaten 
flour in such a condition that no growing child should feed upon it. 
Graham flour supplies all the needs of the stomach, and if house- 
keepers would take pains to make palatable Graham bread, muffins, 
gruel, and the like, the nation would not long be what it is called now 
— one of dyspeptics. 

Graham Bread (i). — Take equal parts of fine flour and Graham, 
for two loaves of bread, and one cup of good potato-yeast ; mix with 
sweet milk or water (cold water is preferable in summer), as stiff as 
can be conveniently stirred with a spoon ; butter the tins ; put in the 
mixture, and set in a warm place for about three hours, and it will be 
light enough to bake. It should be baked about one-third longer 
than fine flour. 

Graham Bread (2). — Purchase your flour in small quantities, and 
if possible procure it at the mill where it is freshly made, as it does 
not retain its sweetness as long as fine flour. Take one quart of milk 
and warm water, or two-thirds of milk and one-third of water ; stir 
this into a pint of wheat flour, and add enough Graham. 

Shaker Bread. — Take half the flour (unbolted) you intend using, 
and pour on boiling milk (be sure it boils), and have it about the con- 
sistency of batter that you would have for making pancakes ; let this 
stand till cool enough to work, then knead in the rest of your flour 
just sufficiently stiff to mould on a board. One hour in a middling 
hot oven is sufficient for baking. 

Corn Bread ( i). — One cup of hominy ; boil it and stir in some Indian 



COOKERY RECIPES. SI9 

meal ; add a teacup of milk, one egg, a piece of butter half as large 
as an egg ; then make it as thick as pound-cake with Indian meal. 
Then comes the secret : bake it quick to a light-brown color. 

Corn Bread (2). — Two cups of Indian meal, one cup of flour, two 
cups of sour milk, and two small teaspoonfuls of saleratus ; one-half 
cup of brown sugar. 

Corn Bread (3). — One pint of buttermilk; one pint of corn-meal; 
half a pint of flour ; one-third cup of molasses ; two teaspoonfuls of 
soda; salt. Bake one hour and a-quarter if the oven is right. Cut 
it with a sharp knife. 

Corn Bread (4). — ^Two cups of flour, one of meal, two eggs, a 
little molasses and a little salt. Mix it with sour milk a little softer 
than pound-cake ; add a teaspoonful of saleratus. 

Self-Raising Bread. — Put three teacups of water — as warm as 
you can bear your finger in — in a two-quart cup or bowl, and three- 
quarters of a teaspoonful of salt ; stir in flour enough to make quite 
a stiff batter. This is for the rising. Set the bowl, closely covered, 
in a kettle in warm water — as warm as you can bear your finger in — 
and keep it as near this temperature as possible. Notice the time 
you set your rising. In three hours stir in two tablespoonfuls of 
flour; put it back, and in five and one-half hours from the time of 
setting it will be within one inch of the top of your bowl. It is then 
light enough, and will make up eight quarts of flour. Make a sponge 
in the centre of your flour with one quart of the same temperature as 
rising ; stir the rising into it, cover with a little dry flour, and put it 
where it will keep very warm and not scald. In three-quarters of an 
hour wring this into stiff dough. If water is used be sure it is very 
warm, and do not work as much as yeast bread. Make the loaves a 
little larger, and keep it warm for another three-quarters of an hour. 
It will then be ready to bake. While rising this last time have your 
oven heating. It needs a hotter oven than yeast bread. 

Egg Corn Bread (Mrs. Patterson's recipe). — One quart of sour 
milk, two teaspoonfuls of soda, one of salt, two eggs. Now stir in 
your meal to make the batter, not too thick. Add last two or three 



520 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

tablespoonfuls of melted lard or butter, and stir not a moment 
longer than to mix it. Pour in your pans, or gem-pans as you pre- 
fer, for baking. Bread or batter made with soda should not be 
kneaded or stirred any longer than just to mix it, and always 
bake quickly. I have seen cooks who stir their batter every time 
they take out any. This is perfectly ruinous to good, crisp cakes. 

Wheat Bread. — Boil or bake three potatoes and mash fine. 
Soak a yeast-cake and add to the potatoes when cool enough. Add 
two teaspoonfuls of salt ; let it stand three or four hours ; then add 
water enough for two loaves of bread. Stir in flour until very stiff; 
let it stand over night. In the morning add half a teaspoonful of 
soda dissolved in water, and butter the size of a walnut. Knead 
thoroughly, and then let it raise very light, and put in bread-pans 
without further kneading. Let it raise quickly to twice its bulk 
when put in the pans. 

French Bread.— Take clean rice, three-fourths of a pound ; tie it 
up in a thick linen bag, giving it room to swell ; boil from three to 
four hours, till it becomes a perfect paste ; mix, while warm, with 
seven pounds of flour, adding yeast, salt and water ; allow the dough 
to work a proper time near the fire ; then divide it into loaves ; dust 
them in and knead vigorously. This quantity will make thirteen 
pounds and seven ounces of excellent bread. 

Excellent Rolls. — To every pound of flour allow one ounce of 
butter, one-quarter of a pint of milk, one large teaspoonful of yeast, a 
little salt. Warm the butter in the milk, add to it the yeast and salt, 
and mix these ingredients well together ; put the flour into a pan, stir 
in the above ingredients, and let the dough raise, covered in a warm 
place. Knead it well, make it into rolls, let them raise again for a few 
minutes, and bake in a quick oven. Richer rolls may be made by 
adding one or two eggs, and a larger proportion of butter, and their 
appearance improved by brushing the tops over with the yolk of an 
egg or a little milk. 

Buns. — At night take three cups of warm milk, one cup of sugar, 
3ne-half a cup of good yeast ; make a batter ; then let it stand over 



COOKERY RECIPES. , 521 

night ; in the tnorning it should be very light ; then add one cup of 
sugar and one cup of butter; mould it well, and let it raise again ; when 
well risen, cut in small pieces, and roll them in the hand ; put them 
on tins just to touch ; let them raise again, and rub over the top with 
the white of an egg, and bake a light-brown. This quantity will make 
sixty buns ; currants or chopped raisins improve them. ' 

Dough Cakes. — One pint of light dough, three eggs, two cups 
of sugar, one cup of butter, cinnamon and nutmeg, with two pounds 
of raisins. Add a coffee-cup of flour. 

SopA Biscuit. — One pint of milk, two teaspoonfuls of soda, two 
teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar; butter half the size of an egg, or 
lard, if butter is not at hand; rub the cream of tartar in the flour; 
dissolve the soda in the milk ; flour enough to roll. Bake in a quick 
oven. 

Plain Soda Biscuit. — One quart of flour, one teaspoonful of soda, 
two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, one-half a teaspoonful of salt, a 
lump of butter the size of an egg; mix into a soft dough; roll out 
and bake quickly — the quicker the better. 

Crisp Soda Biscuit. — Sift flour into pans ready to receive the in- 
gredients. One pint of sour milk, one teaspoonful of soda, one of 
salt ; mix this well into the flour ; pour in the milk. Now measure 
six tablespoonfuls of melted lard ; mix up quickly into good knead- 
ing dough ; roll out half an inch thick and cut out your biscuits ; 
bake quickly. If they get sofl: after they are taken from the oven, 
bake longer the next time. Half the quantity of lard will do for 
those who do not like them so crisp. 

Biscuits (i). — Take some bread-dough, add some shortening, some 
sweet milk, and a teaspoonful of saleratus ; let them stand to raise. 

Biscuits (2). — Three cups of milk, or milk and water, one cup of 
butter or lard, one egg, two tablespoonfuls of yeast. Mix it not 
very stiff, and let it stand six or eight hours to raise. 

Biscuits (3). — One pound of flour, the yolk of one egg ; milk. 
Mix the flour and the yolk of the egg with sufficient milk to make 
the whole into a very stiff paste ; beat it well, and knead it until it is 
33 



522 THE hearthstone; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

perfectly smooth. Roll the paste out very thin, cut out the biscuits, 
and bake in a slow oven twelve or eighteen minutes. 

Hard or Water-biscuit. — Sift flour into a pan for one pint of 
cold water ; one teaspoonful of salt stirred in flour ; half a pint of 
cold lard rubbed in the flour ; now pour your water into it, making 
quite a stiff dough. Knead it well, then roll out several times and 
double it over like pastry ; when it becomes very smooth make out 
the biscuit with your hand, then roll till about half an inch thick ; 
prick them well with a fork through, so that they will not blister. 
Do not bake as fast as soda-bread, and bake much longer. 

Crisp Biscuits. — Two pounds of flour, the yolks of two eggs, milk. 
Mix the flour and the yolks of the eggs with sufficient milk to make 
the whole into a very stiff paste ; beat it well and knead it until it is 
perfectly smooth. Roll the paste out very thin ; with a round cutter 
shape it into small biscuits, and bake them a nice brown in a slow 
oven from twenty to thirty-five minutes. 

Dessert Biscuits, which may be flavored with ground ginger, 
cinnamon, etc. One pound of flour, one-half pound of butter, one- 
half pound of sifted sugar, the yolks of six eggs, flavoring to taste 
Put the butter into a basin ; warm it, but do not allow it to boil ; then 
with the hand beat it to cream. Add the flour by degrees, then the 
sugar and flavoring, and moisten the whole with the yolks of the 
eggs, which should be previously well beaten. When all the ingre- 
dients are thoroughly incorporated, drop the mixture from a spoon 
on to a buttered paper, leaving a distance between each cake, as they 
spread as soon as they begin to get warm. Bake in rather a slow 
oven from twelve to eighteen minutes, and do not let the biscuits 
acquire too much color. In making the above quantity, half may be 
flavored with ground ginger, and the other half with essence of lemon 
or currants, to make a variety. With whatever the preparation is 
flavored, so are the biscuits called; and an endless variety may be 
made in this manner. 

Plaw Johnny-cake. — Wet corn-meal with either hot or cold 
water; pack it one inch thick in a baking-pan and bake it in a hot 
oven. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 5^3 

Strawberry Short-cake. — Make a crust same as for nice biscuit, 
only a little richer ; roll out a crust three-quarters or one inch thick ; 
then spread on one side with butter ; then prepare another crust pre- 
cisely like the first one ; lay the two buttered sides together and 
bake in a long tin-pan ; when done the butter will cause the crusts to 
separate easily ; have your berries mashed a little and sweetened to 
your taste ; put the berries on the under crust and lay the other on 
top of first one ; a little nice cream will not spoil it much. 

Southern Hoe-cake. — Sift a tin-pan half-full of Indian meal; 
throw in a teaspoonful of salt ; pour boiling water on the meal — a 
little at a time, stirring it well with a spoon as you proceed, until 
you have a stiff dough. It must be thoroughly mixed and well 
stirred. Flatten your dough into cakes about the size of a saucer, 
and then bake on the griddle. The griddle should be well heated 
when they are put on, so that they will brown nicely ; when one side 
is done, turn them with a knife. They must be baked brown on 
both sides, and should be about half an inch thick. This is a favorite 
Southern cake. 

Corn Cakes {without eggs, milk or y east). — Sift three pints of corn 
meal, add one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of lard, one tea- 
spoonful of dissolved soda. Make it into a soft dough with one pint 
of cold water, then thin it gradually by adding not quite one and a 
half pints of warm water; when it is all mixed, beat. or stir it well for 
half an hour, then bake on a griddle and serve hot. 

Economy Cakes. — Bread which is old and sour can be made into 
nice cakes. It should be cut into small pieces, and soaked in cold 
water until very soft; then drain off the water and mash the bread 
fine. To three pints of the bread-pulp put a couple of beaten eggs, 
three or four tablespoonfuls of flour, and a little salt; dissolve a tea- 
spoonful of saleratus in a teacup of milk ; strain it ; then stir it into 
the bread; add more milk till it is of the right consistency to fry; the 
batter should be rather thicker than that of buckwheat cakes, and 
cooked in the same manner. 

Nice Breakfast Cakes. — One pound of flour, half a teaspoonful

of tartaric acid, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of car- 
bonate of soda, one and a half breakfast-cupful of milk, one ounce ol 
sifted loaf-sugar, two eggs. These cakes are made in the same man- 
ner as the soda bread, with the addition of eggs and sugar; mix the 
flour, tartaric acid, and salt well together, taking care that the two 
latter ingredients are reduced to the finest powder, and stir in the 
sifted sugar, which should also be very fine; dissolve the soda in 
the milk; add the eggs, which should be well whisked, and, with this 
liquid, work the flour, etc., into a light dough; divide it into small 
cakes ; put them into the oven immediately, and bake about twenty 
minutes. 

Rice or Hominy Griddle Cakes. — To one quart of sweet milk 
put two cups of boiled rice or hominy, two eggs beaten a little; 
throw in a sprinkling of salt, and thicken with wheat-flour. Half a 
teaspoonful of soda dissolved. If the rice be cold, warm the milk 
and rub the rice into it before putting the flour in. 

Bread-Cake. — Four eggs, three cups of dough after it is raised ; 
two cups of sugar, one cup of butter ; a very little soda dissolved in 
water and flavored with nutmeg. Put raisins or currants in if you 
wish. 

Batter Cakes. — Mix the batter, either rye and Indian meal or 
wheat and Indian meal — half of each, one teaspoonful of soda, and 
one of saleratus dissolved in water, then a spoonful of tartaric acid in 
a cup of water, and a little salt. 

Soft Waffles. — One pound of flour, four eggs, one quart of 
milk, one-quarter of a pound of butter, two spoonfuls of yeast ; warm 
the milk and butter together; mix them at ten o'clock in the morning 
for tea. 

Graham Muffins. — Take three pints of lukewarm milk, half a tea- 
cup of home-made hop-yeast, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of salt ; stir it into three pints of Graham flour and one pint 
of barrel flour. Set it in a warm place to raise over night, and next 
morning pour it into "gem" pans or muffin-rings, and bake in a very 
hot oven. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 535 

Muffins (i). — One quart of milk, warm, two eggs, flour to make a 
batter, half a teacup of yeast, and a little salt. 

Muffins (2). — One pint of sweet milk, one pint of cream, one tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful and a-half of soda, stirred 
pretty thick with flour. 

Indian Muffins. — One cup of sour milk, one egg, about a halt 
tablespoonful of melted butter ; one-third as much flour as meal. 
Stir pretty thick ; bake in a quick oven, or on the griddle in rings. 

White Flour Gems. — One quart of sweet milk, one teaspoonful 
of tartar, one-half teaspoonful of soda, three eggs. Add flour to make 
a thick batter ; beat well, put in gem-pails, and bake in a quick oven. 
Beat thi eggs first. 

Dr. Trall's Recipe for Gems. — Stir into the coldest water any 
kind of meal, and mix to a stiff batter, yet so that it may lift with a 
spoon and settle smooth of itself Drop immediately into hot gem- 
pans (iron are best) ; let them stand on the top of the stove a few 
minutes, then bake in a hot oven thirty or forty minutes. When 
done, they should be light and dry when broken. If mushy on the 
inside, the batter was not thick enough. If the gem-pans are hot and 
kept smooth, no greasing is necessary. 

Toast without Butter. — Thicken milk with flour, and stir in a 
well-beaten egg ; mix well before putting in the toasted bread ; it is 
better than butter. 

Crackers. — Three pounds of flour, one-quarter of a pound of 
butter ; rub them well together ; then add a little water, scarcely 
enough to wet it at all ; then work it until it is soft, and will break 
like putty ; they are best baked in a brick oven. 

To Make Pancakes. — Eggs, flour, milk ; to every egg allow one 
ounce of flour, about one gill of milk, one-eighth of a saltspoonful 
of salt. Ascertain that the eggs are fresh ; break each one separately 
in a cup; whisk them well, put them into a basin, with the flo.ur, salt, 
and a few drops of milk, and beat the whole to a perfectly smooth 
batter; then add by degrees the remainder of the milk. The pro- 
portion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the size of the 



526 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

eggs, etc.; but the batter, when ready for frying, should be of the 
consistency of thick cream. Place a small frying-pan on the fire to 
get hot; let it be delicately clean, or the pancakes will stick, and 
when quite hot, put into it a small piece of butter, allowing about 
half an ounce to each pancake. When it is melted, pour in the bat- 
ter, about half a teacupful to a pan five inches in diameter, and fry it 
for about four minutes, or until it is nicely brown on one side. 
By only pouring in a small quantity of batter, and so making the 
pancakes thin, the necessity of turning them— ah operation rather 
difficult to unskilful cooks — is obviated. When the pancake is done, 
sprinkle over it some powdered sugar, roll it up in the pan, and take 
it out with a large slice, and place it on a dish before the fire. Pro- 
ceed in this manner until sufficient are cooked for a dish; then send 
them quickly to table, and continue to send in a further quantity, as 
pancakes are never good unless eaten almost immediately they come 
from the frying-pan. The batter may be flavored with a little grated 
lemon-rind, or the pancakes may have preserve rolled in them instead 
of sugar. Send sifted sugar and a cut lemon to table with them. 
To render the pancakes very light, the yolks and whites of the eggs 
should be beaten separately, and the whites added the last thing to 
the batter before frying. 

Pancakes. — Make a good batter in the usual way, with eggs, milk 
and flour; pour this into a pan, so that it lies very thin; let your 
lard, or whatever else you fry them in, be quite hot. When one 
side is done, toss it up lightly to trim it ; serve with lemon and 
sugar. 

Rice Croquettes. — Half a pound of rice, one quart of milk, six 
ounces of pounded sugar, flavoring of vanilla, lemon-peel, or bitter 
almonds, egg and bread-crumbs, hot lard. Put the rice, milk and 
sugar into a sauce-pan, and let the former gradually swell over a 
gentle fire until all the milk is dried up; and just before the rice is 
done, stir in a few drops of essence of any of the above flavorings. 
Let the rice get cold; then form it into small round balls, dip them 
into yolk of egg, sprinkle them with bread-crumbs, and fry them in 



COOKERY RECIPES. S^7 

boiling lard for about ten minutes, turning them about that they may 
get equally browned. Drain the greasy moisture from them, by 
placing them on a cloth in front of the fire for a minute or two; pile 
them on a white doyley, and send them quickly to table. A small 
piece of jam is sometimes introduced into the middle of each cro- 
quette, which adds very much to the flavor of this favorite dish. 

Rice Fritters. — Six ounces of rice, one quart of milk, three 
ounces of sugar, one ounce of fresh butter, six ounces of orange mar- 
malade, four eggs. Swell the rice in the milk, with the sugar and 
butter, over a slow fire until it is perfectly tender, which will be in 
about three-quarters of an hour. When the rice is done, strain away 
the milk, should there be any left, and mix with it the marmalade 
and well-beaten eggs; stir the whole over the fire until the eggs are 
set; then spread the mixture on a dish to the thickness of about one- 
half inch, or rather thicker. When it is perfectly cold, cut it into 
long strips, dip them in a batter the same as for apple-fritters, and fry 
them a nice brown. Dish them on a white doyley, strew sifted sugar 
over, and serve quickly. 

Squash Fritters. — One pint cooked and well-mashed squash, one 
pint of milk, two eggs and a little salt ; add flour to make the batter 
stiff" enough to turn on the griddle, and not too thick. The addition 
of a teaspoonful of baking-powder will tend to make them lighter ; 
bake on a griddle as pour-cakes. This is a delicious dish. The 
surplus squash of a dinner can thus be economically used for break- 
fast. 

Corn Fritters. — These, though made in this case from canned 
corn, will be found almost as good as those from the fresh. Drain 
off" the liquor from a can of corn and chop the grains very fine in a 
chopping-tray. Add to this paste one cup of milk^ a heaping table- 
spoonful of sugar and one of melted butter, one teaspoonful of salt 
and a saltspoonful of pepper, and two tabkspoonfuls of flour. Beat 
very thoroughly and fry by the spoonful on a griddle, or they can be 
dropped into boiling lard and drained. 

Mush. — Mush cannot be Cooked in less than one hour, and it is 



528 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

better to be cooked four hours ; stir the meal slowly into boiling 
water, so as to have no lumps, and keep stirring as long as the pud- 
ding-stick can be moved ; then let it boil as long as it will blubber 
up, stirring it frequently ; then set it off the fire, and let it simmer by 
the hour. If mush is to be had for supper, it is best to make it while 
the range is hot with the dinner cooking. This will save fire and 
improve the mush. 

Potato Yeast. — Boil six good-sized potatoes, in two quarts of 
water, till done ; then take four tablespoonfuls of flour and two of 
sugar, and work them together with the potatoes and a little of the 
water until perfectly smooth, taking care to keep the remainder of 
the water on the stove until needed ; when sufficiently mashed, add 
the rest of the water, and, after stirring together, put through a 
colander to prevent any lumps in the yeast ; when about lukewarm, 
add a little stock yeast, and set in a warm place for about half a day, 
and it will be sufficiently raised to put in cans or jars in a cool place. 

Yeast. — To one pup of grated potatoes pour one quart of boiling 

water ; add one-half cup of sugar and one-half cup of salt ; add, when 

cooled to a little more than milk-warm, one cup of yeast. Put in a 

warm place to raise. 

CAKES AND ICING. 

A Few Hints Respecting the Making and Baking of Cakes. 
— Eggs should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks 
separated, and they should always be strained. Breaking the eggs 
thus, the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the others, 
and so cause no waste. As eggs are used instead of yeast, they 
should be very thoroughly whisked ; they are generally sufficiently 
beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that falls from the 
whisk. 

Loaf-sugar should be well pounded, and then sifted through a fine 
sieve. 

Currants should be nfcely washed, picked, dried in a cloth, and 
then examined, that no pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst 
them. They should then be laid on a dish before the fire, to become 



COOKERY RECIPES. $29 

thoroughly dry ; as, if added damp to the other ingredients, cakes 
will be liable to be heavy. 

Good butter should always be used in the manufacture of cakes; 
and if beaten to a cream, it saves much time and labor to warm, but 
not melt it before baking. 

Less butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed 
with the other ingredients. 

The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for large 
cakes. If the heat be not tolerably fierce, the batter will not raise. If 
the oven is too quick, and there is any danger of the cake burning or 
catching, put a sheet of clean paper over the top. Newspaper, or 
paper that has been printed on, should never be used for this purpose. 

To know when a cake is sufficiently baked, plunge a clean knife 
into the middle of it ; draw it quickly out, and if it looks in the least 
sticky, put the cake back, and close the oven door until the cake is 
done. 

Cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or jars, and in a dry 
place. Those made with yeast do not keep so long as those made 
without it. 

Icing. — Whites of four eggs, one pound of powdered white sugar, 
lemon or other seasoning. Break the whites into a broad, clean, cool 
dish. Throw a small handful of sugar upon them, and begin whip- 
ping it in with long, even strokes of the beater. A few minutes later 
throw in more sugar, and keep adding it at intervals until it is all 
used up. Beat with a regular sweeping motion of the whisk, until the 
icing is of a smooth, fine and firm texture. Half an hour's beating 
should be sufficient, if done well. If not stiff enough, add more 
sugar. If the seasoning is lemon-juice, allow, in measuring the sugar, 
for the-additional liquid. Lemon-juice, or a very little tartaric acid, 
whitens the icing. Use at least a quarter of a pound of sugar for each 
egg. Frosting made this way hardens in one-fourth the time re- 
quired under the former plan, and not more than half the time is 
required in the making of it. Pour the icing by the spoonful on the 
»top of the cake, and near the centre of the surface to be covered. If 



530 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

the loaf is of such a shape that the liquid will settle of itself to its 
place, it is best to do so. If it is spread, use a broad-bladed knife, 
dipped in cold water. It is best to dry it in the sun where there is 
no dust. 

Frosting for Cakes. — Allow for the white of one egg twelve 
heaping teaspoonfuls of white powdered sugar. Beat the whites of 
eggs to a stiff froth, then stir in the sugar gradually, and continue the 
stirring for ten or fifteen minutes. Season, with lemon-juice. To frost 
a common-sized loaf of cake, allow the white of one egg and half of 
another. 

Royal Icing for Cakes. — Have ready a pound of the best white 
sugar, which pound well and sift through a silk sieve ; put it into a 
basin with the whites of three eggs; beat well together witli a wooden 
spoon, adding the juice of half a lemon; keep beating well until it 
becomes very light and hangs in flakes from the .spoon ; if it should 
be rather too stiff in mixing, add a little more wl.ite of egg ; if, on the 
contrary, too soft, a little more sugar ; it is then ready for use when 
required. 

To Color Icing Yellow. — Icing may be colored yellow by put- 
ting the grated peel of a lemon or orange in a thin muslin bag, 
straining a little juice through it, and squeezing it hard into the egg 
and sugar. Cranberry syrup and strawberry juice color a pretty 
pink. 

Mrs. Reynolds' Recipe for Icing. — Beat the whites of three ^ 
eggs to a stiff froth ; melt one pound and a-quarter of loaf-sugar, and, 
while boiling hot, pour it over the eggs, stirring it until the whole is 
thoroughly mixed. Then add a large spoonful of powdered starch, 
a spoonful of vinegar, and flavor it with oil of lemon. 

Handsome and delicious frosting can be made by using the yolks 
of eggs instead of the whites. Proceed exactly as for ordinary frost- 
ing. It will harden just as nicely as that does. This is particularly 
good for orange cake, harmonizing with the color of the cake in a 
way to delight the soul of the aesthetic. 

Sponge Cake. — The weight of eggs in fine white sugar, half the 



COOKERY RECIPES. 531 

weight of eggs in flour ; beat whites and yolks separately, adding the 
sugar gradually to the yolks ; now add your whites after they have 
been beaten, to a stiff froth. Last, your flour and flavoring beat in 
very quickly, and not a moment longer stirring than just to mix it. 
This is the secret of sponge cake. A good, steady heat for baking — 
not too hot, as this spoils the lightness.

534 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

cocoanuts, one pound and three-fourths of flour, ten eggs, half a tea- 
spoonful of soda; flavor with nutmeg; this quantity will make two 
loaves. 

Lady Fingers. — Beat the yolks of four eggs with a quarter of a 
pound of sugar till smooth and light; whisk the whites of the eggs, 
and add to these and sift in a quarter of a pound of flour; make into 
a smooth paste, and lay on buttered paper in the size and shape the 
cakes are required; bake quickly; while hot, press two of the cakes 
into one on the flat side. 

Jumbles. — Ten cups of flour, two teaspoonfuls of soda, three of 
cream of tartar, one-half cup of sweet milk ;• sift soda or cream of 
tartar into the flour; mix it well; beat eight eggs very light, adding 
four cups of sugar to the eggs, two cups of butter into the flour, and 
flavor to taste; pour in eggs, sugar and milk; mix up quickly with 
the hand ; roll out thin, cut and bake nicely, and you will have ex- 
cellent small cakes. 

Pound Cake. — One pound of butter, one pound and a quarter of 
flour, one pound of pounded loaf-sugar, one pound of currants, nine 
eggs, two ounces of candied peel, half an ounce of citron, half an 
ounce of sweet almonds; when liked, a little pounded mace. Work 
the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour; add the sugar, currants, 
candied peel, which should be cut into neat slices, and the almonds, 
which should be blanched and chopped, and mix all these well to- 
gether; whisk the eggs, and let them be thoroughly blended with 
the dry ingredients ; beat the cake well for twenty minutes, and put 
it into a round tin, lined at the bottom and sides with a strip of 
white, buttered paper. Bake it from one and a half to two hours, 
and let the oven be well heated when the cake is first put in, as, if 
this is not the case, the currants will all sink to the bottom of it. To 
make this preparation light, the yolks and whites of the eggs should 
be beaten separately, and added separately to the other ingredients. 
A glass of wine is sometimes added to the mixture; but this is 
scarcely necessary, as the cake will be found quite rich enough with- 
out it. Cook one and a half to two hours. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 535 

Macaroons. — Half a pound of sweet almonds, half a pound of 
sifted loaf-sugar, the whites of three eggs, wafer-paper. Blanch, skin 
and dry the almonds, and pound them well with a little orange-flower 
water or plain water; then add to them the sifted sugar and the 
whites of the eggs, which should be beaten to a stiff froth, and mix 
all the ingredients well together. When the paste looks soft, drop it 
at equal distances from a biscuit-syringe on to sheets of wafer-paper ; 
put a strip of almond on the top of each ; strew some sugar over, and 
bake the macaroons in rather' a slow oven, of a light-brown color. 
When hard and set they are done, and must not be allowed to get 
very brown, as that vvould spoil their appearance. If the cakes, 
when baked, appear heavy, add a little more white of egg, but let 
this always be well whisked before it is added to the other ingredi- 
ents. Cook from fifteen to twenty minutes, in a slow oven.

ble you to roll the dough out easily. Bake in a moderately heated 
oven. 

Gingerbread. — Two cups of molasses, one cup of butter, one cup 
of water, one heaping tablespoonful of ginger, one teaspoonful of

before it is put into the pans. It takes over two hours to bake it if 
the loaves are thick, if the loaves are thin it will bake in less time. 
This kind of cake is the best after it has been made three or four 
weeks, and it will keep good five or six months. 

Economical Fruit Cake. — One cup of butter, half a cup of sugar, 
two cups of raisins, two eggs, one teaspoonful of soda; spices to suit 
the taste ; citron, if you choose. 

COFFEE, TEA AND BEVERAGES. 

The most important thing for a breakfast is coffee. With a cup 
of coffee and a piece of dry toast one can manage to get through 
the morning until luncheon time. To many, coffee is as meat 
and drink. Pope, who was very fond of coffee, was in the habit of 
calling up his servant in the middle of the night to prepare it for 
him ; he couldn't wait for morning to come. In those days it was 
the custom — and it was not a bad one, either — to grind and make the 
coffee at the table. 

Tea and coffee both excite the activity of the brain and nerves. 
Tea, it is said, increases the power of digesting the impressions we 
have received, creates a thorough meditation, and, in spite of the 
movements of thoughts, permits the attention to be fixed upon a cer- 
tain subject. On the other hand, if tea is taken in excess, it causes 
an increased irritability of the nerves, characterized by sleeplessness, 
with a general feeling of restlessness and trembling of the limbs. 
Coffee, also, if taken in excess, produces sleeplessness and many 
baneful effects, very similar to those arising from tea-drinking. 

Coffee. — To have coffee in perfection, it should be roasted and 
ground just before it is used, and more should not be ground at a 
time than is wanted for immediate use, or if it be necessary to grind 
more, it should be kept closed from the air. Coffee readily imbibes 
exhalations from other substances, and thus often acquires a bad 
flavor; brown sugar placed near it will communicate a disagreeable 
flavor. 

To Roast Coffee {a French recipe). — It being an acknowledged facl

that the best French coffee is decidedly superior to that made here, 
and as the roasting of the berry is of great importance to the flavor 
of the preparation, it will be useful and interesting to know how they 
manage these things in France. In Paris there are two houses 
justly celebrated for the flavor of their coffee — La Maison Corcellet 
and La Maison Roy cr de Chartres ; and to obtain this flavor, before 
roasting they add to every three pounds of coffee a piece of butter 
the size of a nut, and a dessertspoonful of powdered sugar; it is then 
roasted in the usual manner. The addition of the butter and sugar 
develops the flavor and aroma of the berry; but it must be borne in 
mind that the quality of the butter must be of the very best de- 
scription. 

To MAKE Essence of Coffee. — To every quarter of a pound of 
ground coffee allow one small teaspoonful of powdered chiccory, 
three small teacupfuls, or one pint, of water. Let the coffee be 
freshly ground, and, if possible, freshly roasted; put it into a perco- 
lator, or filter, with the chiccory, and pour slowly over it the above 
proportion of boiling water. When it has all filtered through, warm 
the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the simmering point, but do not 
allow it to boil ; then filter it a second time, put it into a clean and 
dry bottle, cork it well, and it will remain good for several days. 
Two tablespoonfuls of this essence are quite sufficient for a breakfast- 
cupful of hot milk. This essence will be found particularly useful 
to those persons who have to rise extremely early, and, having only 
the milk to make boiling, is very easily and quickly prepared. 
When the essence is bottled, pour another three teacupfuls of boil- 
ing water slowly on the grounds, which, when filtered through, will 
be very weak coffee. The next time there is essence to be prepared, 
make the weak coffee boiling, and pour it on the ground coffee 
instead of plain water; by this means a better coffee will be obtained. 
Never throw away the grounds without having made use of them in 
this manner, and always cork the bottle well that contains this 
preparation until the day that it is wanted for making the fresh 
essence. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 539 

To MAKE Coffee. — Allow one-half ounce, or one tablespoojiful of 
ground coffee to each person ; to every ounce of coffee allow one- 
third pint of water. To make coffee good it should never be boiled, 
but the boiling water merely poured on it, the same as for tea. The 
coffee should always be purchased in the berry — if possible, freshly 
roasted ; and it should never be ground long before it is wanted for 
use. There are very many new kinds of coffee-pots, but the method 
of making the coffee is nearly always the same, namely, pouring the 
boiling water on the powder, and allowing it to filter through. 
Coffee should always be served very hot, and, if possible, in the 
same vessel in which it is made, as pouring it from one pot to 
another cools, and consequently spoils it. Many persons may think 
that the proportion of water we have given for each ounce of coffee 
is rather small. It is so, and the coffee produced from it will be 
very strong; one-third of a cup will be found quite sufficient, which 
should be filled up with nice hot milk, or milk and cream mixed. 
Should the ordinary method of making coffee be preferred, use dou- 
ble the quantity of water, and, in pouring it into the cups, put in 
more coffee and less milk. 

Another Mode of making Coffee. — Put a quarter of a pound of 
fresh-roasted coffee (this will be sufficient: for three persons) in a 
basin, and break into it an egg — yolk, white, shell and all; mix it up 
with the spoon to the consistence of mortar. Put warm, not boiling, 
water in the coffee-pot; let it boil up and break three times; then 
stand a few minutes and it will be as clear as amber, and the egg will 
give it a rich taste. 

The rank flavor often observed in coffee may be sometimes justly 
referred to the tin coffee-pot in which it is boiled and allowed to re- 
main a while. An earthen or porcelain-lined vessel is the best for 
making coffee. 

Nutritious Coffee. — Half an ounce of ground coffee, one pint of 
milk. Let the coffee be freshly ground ; put it into a saucepan with 
the milk, which should be made nearly boiling before the coffee is 
put in, and boil both together for three minutes; clear it by pouriner 



540 THE HEARTHSTONE ; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

some of it into a cup and then back again, and leave it on the hob 
for a few minutes to settle thoroughly. This coffee may be made 
still more nutritious by. the addition of an egg well beaten and put 
into the coffee-cup. 

To MAKE Good Coffee {Mrs. Patterson's recipe). — Take an ordi- 
nary teacup of ground coffee for four persons, mix with it a small 
egg ; pour in the coffee-pot. Add one quart of cold water, set back 
on the stove where it will not boil, but steep for half an hour, shaking 
occasionally to mix it. A few minutes before serving, add the de- 
sired quantity of boiling water and let it boil now for a few minutes ; 
take off pour out some, and return it, let it stand a few minutes, and 
it is ready to serve. To have this, as all other coffee, good, the cof- 
fee-pot should be bright inside. 

Adulterated Coffee — how to Detect It. — Ground ^ioffee 
affords a field for adulteration, and for this purpose chiccory, carrots, 
caramel, date-seeds, etc., are the substances most commonly used. 
The beans have of late years been skilfully imitated, but as coffee is 
mostly purchased in the ground condition, the chief point for the 
consumer is to be able to form some idea as to the character of the 
latter article, and the following are a few simple and reliable tests: 

Take a little of the coffee and press it between the fingers, or give 
it a squeeze in the paper in which it is bought; if genuine, it will net 
form a coherent mass, as coffee-grains are hard and do not readilji 
adhere to each other ; but if the grains stick to each other and form 
a sort of " cake," you may be pretty sure of adulteration in the shape 
of chiccory, for the grains of chiccory are softer and more open, and 
adhere without difficulty when squeezed. Again, if you place a few 
grains in a saucer and moisten them with a little cold water, chiccory 
will very quickly become soft like bread-crumbs, while coffee will 
take a long time to soften. A third test: take a wine-glass or a 
tumbler full of water, and gently drop a pinch of the ground coffee 
on the surface of the water -without stirring or agitating ; genuine 
coffee will float for some time, whilst chiccory or any other soft root 
will soon sink ; and chiccory or caramel will cause a yellowish or 



COOKERY RECIPES. 54 1 

brownish color to diffuse rapidly through the water, while pure 
coffee will give no sensible tint under such circumstances for a con- 
siderable length of time. " Coffee mixtures " or " coffee improvers " 
should be avoided. They seldom consist of anything but chiccory 
and caramel. 

" French coffee," so widely used at present, is generally ground 
coffee, the beans of which have been roasted with a certain amount 
of sugar, which, coating over the bean, has retained more of the 
original aroma than in ordinary coffee, but this, of course, at the 
expense of the reduced percentage of coffee due to the presence of 
the caramel. 

To Make Tea. — There is very little art in making good tea ; if 
the water is boiling, and there is no sparing of the fragrant leaf, the 
beverage will almost invariably be good. The old-fashioned plan of 
allowing a teaspoonful to each person, and one over, is still practised. 
Warm the teapot with boiling water ; let it remain for two or three 
minutes for the vessel to become thoroughly hot, then pour it away. 
Put in the tea, pour in from one-half to three-quarters of a pint of 
boiling water, close the lid, and let it stand for the tea to draw from 
five to ten minutes ; then fill up the pot with water. The tea will be 
quite spoiled unless made with water that is actually boiling, as the 
leaves will not open, and the flavor not be extracted from them ; the 
beverage will consequently be colorless and tasteless — in fact, nothing 
but tepid water. Where there is a very large party to make tea for, it 
is a good plan to have two tea-pots instead of putting a large quan- 
. tity of tea into one pot ; the tea, besides, will go further. When the 
infusion has been once completed the addition of fresh tea adds very 
little to the strength ; so, when more is required, have the pot emptied 
of the old leaves, scalded, and fresh tea made in the usual manner. 
Economists say that a few grains of carbonate of soda, added before 
the boiling water is poured on the tea, assist to draw out the good- 
ness ; if the water is very hard, perhaps it is a good plan, as the soda 
softens it ; but care must be taken to use this ingredient sparingly, as 
it is liable to give the tea a soapy taste if added in too large a quan- 



542 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

tity. For mixed tea, the usual proportion is four spoonfuls of black 
to one of green ; more of the latter when the flavor is very much 
liked ; but strong green tea is highly pernicious, and should never be 
partaken of too freely. 

Green Tea. — Green tea should not be boiled ; it has the freshest 
taste when steeped in an earthen teapot which has been previously 
scalded, leaving it to stand by the fire ten or fifteen minutes ; turn 
only a small quantity of scalding water upon the tea while steeping, 
but fill the pot when ready to take to the table. 

Chocolate (i). — A very old French recipe for making breakfast 
chocolate has been carefully tested and found perfect by the writer ; 
simply place a square in a cup, and pour upon it enough boiling milk 
to dissolve it into a paste ; meantime have the milk boiling in a 
sauce-pan until it boils to a bubble, then gently stir in the paste, stir- 
ring until thoroughly mixed, and sweeten to taste. The white of 
eggs foamed on top is an improvement. 

Chocolate (2). — Put into a coffee-pot set in boiling water, one quart 
of new milk (or a pint each of cream and milk) ; stir into it three 
heaping tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate mixed to a paste with 
cold milk ; let boil two or three minutes and serve at once. If not 
wanted so rich, use half water and half milk. 

To MAKE Chocolate (3). — Allow one-half ounce of chocolate to 
each person ; to every ounce allow one-half pint of water, one-half pint 
of milk. Make the milk and water hot; scrape the chocolate into it 
and stir the mixture constantly and quickly until the chocolate is 
dissolved ; bring it to the boiling-point, stir it well, and serve directly 
with white sugar. 

Miss Evarts' Chocolate. — A daughter of Secretary Evarts was 
noted in Washington for the delicious chocolate served at his recep- 
tions. Her recipe is as follows : Break up the chocolate and place 
in a warm spot to melt. Put in a farina kettle and pour on boiling 
milk. Stir while pouring in the milk, and stir constantly while cook- 
ing. Let it boil some minutes, and serve with whipped cream. Use 
Maillard's chocolate, already sweetened. 



COOKERY RECIPES. 543 

To MAKE Cocoa. — Allow two teaspoonfuls of prepared cocoa to 
one breakfast-cup ; boiling milk and boiling water. Put the cocoa into 
a breakfast-cup, pour over it sufficient cold milk to make it into a 
paste ; then add equal quantities of boiling milk and boiling water, 
and stir all well together. Care must be taken not to allow the milk 
to get burnt, as it will entirely spoil the flavor of the preparation. 
The above directions are usually given for making the prepared 
cocoa. The rock cocoa, or that bought in a solid piece, should be 
scraped, and made in the same manner, taking care to rub down all 
the lumps before the boiling liquid is added. 

An Excellent Substitute for Milk or Cream in Tea or Cof- 
fee. — Allow one new-laid egg to every large breakfast-cupful of tea 
or coffee. Beat up the whole of the egg in a basin, put it into a tea- 
cup (or a portion of it, if the cup be small), and pour over it the tea 
or coffee very hot. These should be added very gradually, and 
stirred all the time, to prevent the egg 'from curdling. In point of 
nourishment, both these beverages are much improved by this addi- 
tion. Allow one egg to every large breakfast-cupful of tea or coffee. 

To MAKE Barley-water. — Two ounces of pearl-barley, two quarts 
of boiling water, one pint of cold water. Wash the barley in cold 
water; put it into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold 
water, and when it has boiled for about one-quarter of an hour, 
strain off the water, and add the two quarts of fresh boiling water. 
Boil it until the liquid is reduced one-half; strain it, and it will be 
ready for use. It may be flavored with lemon-peel, after being 
sweetened, or a small piece may be simmered with the barley. 
When the invalid may take it, a little lemon-juice giveS this pleasant 
drink in illness a very nice flavor. Boil until the liquid is reduced 
one-half 

To MAKE Toast-and- Water. — A slice of bread, one quart of boil- 
ing water. Cut a slice from a stale loaf (a piece of hard crust is bet- 
ter than anything else for the purpose) ; toast it of a nice brown on 
every side, but do not allow it to burn or blacken. Put it into a jug^ 
pour the boiling water over it, cover it closely, and let it remain un- 



544 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

til cold. When strained, it will be ready for use. Toast-and-water 
should always be made a short time before it is required, to enable it 
to get cold; if drunk in a tepid or lukewarm state, it is an exceed- 
ingly disagreeable beverage. If, as is sometimes the case, this drink 
is wanted in a hurry, put the toasted bread into a jug, and only just 
cover it. with the boiling water; when this is cool, cold water may be 
added in the proportion required — the toast-and-water strained; it 
will then be ready for use, and is more expeditiously prepared than 
by the above method. 

Nourishing Lemonade. — One and one-half pints of boiling water, 
the juice of four lemons, the rinds of two, one half-pint of sherry, 
four eggs, six ounces of loaf-sugar. Pare off the lemon-rind thinly, 
put it into a jug with the sugar, and pour over the boiling water; let 
it cool, then strain it; add the wine, lemon-juice and eggs, previously 
well beaten, and also strained, and the beverage will be ready for 
use. If thought desirable, the quantity of sherry and water could he 
lessened, and milk substituted for them. To obtain the flavor of the 
lemon-rind properly, a few lumps of the sugar should be rubbed over 
it, until some of the yellow is absorbed. 

Lemonade. — The rind of two lemons, the juice of three large or 
four small ones, half a pound of, loaf-sugar, one quart of boiling 
water. Rub some of the sugar, in lumps, on two of the lemons un- 
til they have imbibed all the oil from them, and put it with the re- 
mainder of the sugar into a jug; add the lemon-juice (but no pips), 
and pour over the whole a quart of boiling water; when the sugar is 
dissolved, strain the lemonade through a fine sieve or piece of mus- 
lin, and when cool it will be ready for use. The lemonade will be 
much improved by having the white of an egg beaten up in it; a lit- 
tle sherry mixed with it, also, makes this beverage much nicer. 

Flax-Seed Lemonade. — Four tablespoonfuls flax-seed, whole ; 
one quart boiling water poured upon the flax-seed ; juice of two 
lemons, leaving out the peel ; sweeten to taste; steep three hours in 
a covered pitcher ; if too thick, put in cold water with the lemon- 
juice and sugar. Good for colds.

[^ MILK, CHEESE, BUTTER, ETC. 

To Keep Milk and Cream in Hot Weather. — When the 
weather is very warm, and it is very difficult to prevent milk from 
turning sour and spoiling the cream, it should be scalded, and then it 
will remain good for a few hours. It must on no account be allowed 
to boil, or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the milk ; and 
the slower the process the safer it will be. A very good plan to scald 
milk is to put the pan that contains it into a saucepan or wide kettle 
of boiling water. When the surface looks thick, the milk is suffi- 
ciently scalded, and it should then be put away in a cool place in the 
same vessel that it was scalded in. Cream may be kept for twenty- 
four hours, if scalded without sugar ; a!nd, by the addition of the lat- 
ter ingredient, it will remain good double the time, if kept in a cool 
place. All pans, jugs and vessels intended for milk should be kept 
beautifully clean, and well scalded before the milk is put in, as any 
negligence in this respect may cause large quantities of it to be 
spoiled; and milk should never be kept in vessels of zinc or copper. 
Milk may be preserved good in hot weather for a few hours by plac- 
ing the jug which contains it in ice, or very cold water; or a pinch 
of bicarbonate of soda may be introduced into the liquid. Milk, when 
of good quality, is of an opaque white color ; the cream always comes 
to the top ; the well-known milky odor is strong ; it will boil without 
altering its appearance in these respects ; the little bladders which 
arise on the surface will renew themselves if broken by the spoon. 
To boil milk is, in fact, the simplest way of testing its quality. The 
commonest adulterations of milk are not of a hurtful character. It is 
a good deal thinned with water, and sometimes thickened with a little 
starch, or colored with yolk of egg, or even saffron ; but these pro- 
cesses have nothing murderous in them. 

Toasted Cheese, or Welsh Rarebit. — Slices of bread, butter, 
Cheshire or Gloucester cheese, mustard and pepper. Cut the bread 
mto slices about half an inch in thickness ; pare off the crust, toast 
the bread slightly, without hardening or burning it, and spread it with 



546 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

butter. Cut some slices, not quite so large as the bread, from a good, 
rich, fat cheese ; lay them on the toasted bread in a cheese-toaster ; 
be careful that the cheese does not burn, and let it be equally melted. 
Spread over the top a little made mustard and a seasoning of pepper, 
and serve very hot, with very hot plates. To facilitate the melting of 
the cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes or toasted on one side before 
it is laid on the bread. As it is so essential to send this dish hot to 
table, it is a good plan to melt the cheese in small, round silver or 
metal pans, and to send these pans to table, allowing one for each 
guest. Slices of dry or buttered toast should always accompany 
them, with mustard, pepper and salt. Should the cheese be dry, a 
little butter mixed with it will be an improvement. 

Cottage Cheese — (i). — To make cottage cheese take nice, clab- 
bered milk, not too sour, but do not scald it ; pour into a bag of thin 
cloth, and drain ; when it is drained enough, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper ; mash fine ; thin to a batter with sweet cream, and it is ready 
for the table. 

Cottage Cheese — (2). — Take some sweet milk and stand it on 
the stove in a new pan or pail, shaking it occasionally, that the form- 
ing curd may not settle to the bottom. Turn the edges gently that 
the curd may form evenly, taking care not to break it, and not let it 
cook too fast. If the heat is about right, it will be done in half an 
hour. Then drain off the whey slowly, pressing down on the curd 
until only whey enough remains in it that the cheese will not be too 
dry — just moist enough to mix well ; then salt to taste ; add a good 
lump of butter and work well with the hand ; then pack it down in a 
crock, leaving all the moisture in it. This is better than to press it 
into dry balls. Set it in the coolest part of the cellar or spring 
house. Take it out into a deep white dish and very carefully dip out 
and lay over the top of it a few spoonfuls of thick cream, sweet or 
sour ; the sour is preferable. 

Curds and Whey. — A very small piece of rennet, half a gallon 
of milk. Procure from the butcher's a small piece of rennet, which 
is the stomach of the calf, taken as soon as it is killed, scoured, and 



COOKERY RECIPES. 547 

well rubbed with salt, and stretched on sticks to dry. Pour some 
boiling water on the rennet, and let it remain for six hours ; then use 
the liquor to turn the milk. The milk should be warm and fresh 
from the cow ; if allowed to cool, it must be heated till it is of a de- 
gree quite equal to new milk ; but do not let it be too hot. About a 
tablespoonful, or rather more, would be sufficient to turn the above 
proportion of milk into curds and whey; and, whilst the milk is 
turning, let it be kept in rather a warm place. It takes from two to 
three hours to turn the milk. 

Cheese Fritters. — Slice thin half a dozen large tart apples, and 
prepare half as many thin slices of nice cheese. Beat up one or two 
eggs, according to the quantity required, and season high with salt, 
mustard and a little pepper. Lay the slices of cheese to soak for a 
few moments in the mixture, then put each slice between two slices 
of apples, sandwich style, and dip the whole into the eggs, then fry 
in hot butter like oysters, and serve very hot. These fritters are an 
addition to any breakfast table. 

Butter-Motjlds. — Butter-moulds, or wooden stamps for moulding 
fresh butter, are much used, and are made in a variety of forms and 
shapes. In using them, let them be kept scrupulously clean, and, 
before the butter is pressed in, the interior should be well wetted with 
cold water ; the butter must then be pressed in, the mould opened, and 
the perfect shape taken out. The butter may be then dished and gar- 
nished with a wreath of parsley — if for a cheese course. If for break- 
fast, put it into an ornamental butter-dish, with a little water at the 
bottom, should the weather be very warm. 

Rancid Butter made Sweet. — To one quart of water add fifty- 
five drops of the chloride of lime ; then wash thoroughly in this mix- 
ture five pounds of rancid butter. It must remain in the mixture two 
hours. Then wash twice in pure water and once in sweet milk ; add 
salt. This preparation of lime contains nothing injurious. 

To Keep and Choose Fresh Butter. — Fresh butter should be 
kept in a dark, cool place, and in as- large a mass as possible. Mould 
as much only as is required, as the more surface is exposed, the more 



548 THE HEARTHSTONE; OR, LIFE AT HOME. 

liability there will be to spoil ; and the outside very soon becomes 
rancid. Fresh butter should be kept covered with white paper. For 
small larders, butter-coolers of red brick are now very much used for 
keeping fresh butter in warm weather. These coolers are made with 
a large, bell-shaped cover, into the top of which a little cold water 
should be poured, and in summer time very frequently changed ; and 
the butter must be kept covered. These coolers keep butter remark- 
ably firm in hot weather, and are extremely convenient for those whose 
larder accommodation is limited. In choosing fresh butter, remember 
it should smell deliciously, and be of an equal color all through ; if 
it smells sour it has not been sufficiently washed from the buttermilk ; 
and if veiny and open it has probably been worked with a staler or 
an inferior sort. 

Nothing is more unsatisfactory than to sit down day after day to 
the same bill of fare. There are houses where the mistress seems to 
have no inventive faculty, acquired or innate. Breakfast consists 
from Monday till Saturday of the same fried pork and potatoes, or 
sausages and cakes. Remnants of things come on again and again, 
growing small by degrees, till one grows very tired of seeing them. 
All this can be remedied by a little planning. Manage for your own 
family as if you had guests, and vary the arrangement of your table 
and articles of your diet. Health will be preserved thus, and the 
dyspepsia averted. 

A Good Dinner is perfect food perfectly dressed ; not a great 
array of dishes. The art of cooking is the first of the fine arts. The 
first woman in America is not she who bears most children — a brutal 
Napoleonism — but she who prepares the best dish ; because, by this 
one act, this superior accomplishment, she contributes to the health 
of her children and the fidelity of her husband. 

Hurried Dinners. — It is a mistake to eat quickly. Mastication 
performed in haste must be imperfect even with the best of teeth, 
and due admixture of the salivary secretion with the food cannot 
take place. When a crude mass of inadequately crushed muscular 
fibre, or undivided solid material of any description, is thrown into 



COOKERY RECIPES. 549 

the stomach, it acts as a mechanical irritant, arid sets up a condi- 
tion in the mucous membrane lining that organ which greatly im- 
pedes, if it does not altogether prevent, the process of digestion. 
When the practice of eating quickly and filling the stomach with 
unprepared food is habitual, the digestive organ is rendered inpap- 
able of performing its proper functions. Either a much larger quan- 
tity of food than would be necessary under natural conditions is 
required, or the system suffers from lack of nourishment. Those 
animals which were intended to feed hurriedly were either gifted with 
the power of rumination or provided with gizzards. Man is not 
so furnished, and it is fair to assume that he was intended to eat 
slowly. 



MISCELLANEOUS HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 

How TO Clean Soapsuds. — Housekeepers who are limited in theii 
supply of good washing water can make it do double duty by dis- 
serving alum in hot water and throwing it into the tub of soapsuds. In 
a moment the soap will curdle, and, accompanied by muddy particles, 
will sink to the bottom, leaving the water perfectly clear and devoid 
of the smell of soap. This water can be used for washing a second 
time, if poured off the sediment. Where water is scarce, this fact is 
invaluable. 

To Clean a Carpet. — Shake and beat it well, tack it firmly upon 
the floor, and then with clean flannel wash it over with a quart of 
bullock's gall mixed with three quarts of soft cold water, and rub it 
off with a clean flannel or house-cloth. 

To Clean Knives with Expedition and Ease. — Make a strong 
solution of the common washing-soda and water; after wiping them, 
dip the blades of the knives into the solution ; then polish on a knife- 
board ; the same would, of course, be effectual for forks. Never put 
ivory-handled knives into warm water ; it discolors and then cracks 
them. If knives are wrapped up in chamois leather they will never 
rust unless put away damp. 

To Preserve Herbs. — Suspend them in a dry, airy place, with the 
blossom downward. The medicinal ones, when dry, should be 
wrapped in paper, and kept from the air. 

To Clean Glass. — Water-lime, applied with a soft, dry cloth, will 
give glass a nice clear cast. 

To Remove Paint-stains from Glass Windows. — It frequently 
happens that painters splash the plate or other glass windows when 
they are painting the sills. When this is the case, melt some soda 
(55°) 



JIISCELLANEOUS HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 55 1 

in very hot water, and wash them with it, using a soft flannel. It 
vvill entirely remove the paint. 

To Sweeten' Old Lard. — Take a small bunch of slippery-elm 
bark and put it in the lard, and cook one hour. 

To Take Marks Off of Varnished Furniture. — Wet a sponge 
in common alcohol camphor, and apply it freely to the furniture. It 
has nearly, if not quite, the same effect that varnish has, and is much 
cheaper. 

A Teaspoonful of Borax added to an ordinary kettle of hard 
water, in which it is allowed to boil, will effectually soften the water. 
Potatoes cut in small squares, and put into cruets or bottles with 
the water that is to wash them, will clean them quickly and thor- 
oughly. 

Dishcloths and Iron-holders should be made neatly and kept 
clean. The former is best made of worn cotton flannel. Dishcloths 
should never be used about the stove or range, and iron-holders 
should not answer for stovecloths even on ironing day. 

Soap would not be required in washing dishes if a stone jar was 
kept at hand filled with lye, and the greasy dishes were dipped into 
it. If this lye becomes greasy, it should be poured into the tub into 
which all bones and extra grease is put, and, when a sufficient quan- 
tity is accumulated, it could be boiled and good soap be made. 

Zinc may be nicely cleared by putting soft soap on it with a cloth, 
and rubbing it on carefully. After remaining on a few minutes, wash 
off, and the zinc looks fresh and clean. 

A Strong Alum-water is sure death to bugs of any description. 
Take two pounds of pulverized alum, and dissolve in three quarts of 
boiling water, allowing it to remain over the fire until thoroughly 
dissolved. Apply while hot with a brush, or, what is better, use a 
syringe to force the liquid into the cracks of the walls and bedstead. 
Scatter powdered alum freely in all the places they have appeared, 
and the house will soon be rid of insects of every kind. 

Never buy cheap tinware ; the best double plate will last a life- 
time ; the cheapest will wear out in a year. The .same truth applies 
equally to earthenware, iron and woodenware.

A Mixture of Oil and Ink is a good thing to clean kid boots 
with ; the first softens and the latter blackens them. 

What Makes a Bushel. — A bushel is a bushel, but the weight of 
different articles varies greatly; for instance, a bushel of corn, shelled, 
weighs fifty-eight pounds ; rye, fifty-six pounds ; Irish potatoes, sixty 
pounds ; a bushel of barley weighs forty-six pounds ; wheat, sixty 
pounds ; corn on the cob, seventy pounds ; buckwheat, fifty-two 
pounds; oats, thirty-two pounds; sweet potatoes, fifty pounds ; onions, 
fifty-seven pounds ; beans, sixty-two pounds ; bran, twenty pounds ; 
clover-seed, forty-five pounds ; timothy-seed, sixty pounds ; flax- 
seed, forty-five pounds ; hemp-seed, forty-five pounds ; blue grass- 
seed, fourteen pounds; dried apples, twenty-four pounds; dried 
peaches, thirty-two pounds. 

Household Measures. — As all families are not provided with 
scales and weights, referring to ingredients in general use by every 
housewife, the following information may be useful : Wheat flour, 
one quart, is one pound; Indian-meal, one quart is one pound ; butter, 
when soft, one quart is one pound, one ounce; loaf-sugar, broken, 
one quart is one pound ; best brown sugar, one quart is one pound, 
two ounces ; eggs, average size, ten eggs are one pound ; sixteen 
large tablespoonfuls are a half-pint ; eight, one gill. 

Pillows long used acquire a disagreeable odor. The ticks should 
be emptied and washed, the feathers put into a bag and exposed to 
the heat of the sun for several hours. 

To Keep Seeds from the Depredations of Mice, mix some 
pieces of camphor-gum with the seeds. Camphor placed in trunks 
or drawers will prevent mice from doing them injury. 

Cockroaches will flee the paint which has been washed in cool 
alum-water. 

Common Bricks may be made fireproof by soaking them in hot 
tar. 

Boiling-hot Water should never be poured upon china; it cracks 
the enamel. 

Benzole and common clay will clean marble.

Grease can, be drawn from unpainted kitchen floors by putting 
plenty of soft soap on the spot and rubbing a hot flat-iron through 
the soap. One application is usually sufficient ; sometimes another 
is required, washing thoroughly afterwards. 

Rubbing Flat-irons on sand-paper will remove every bit of starch, 
and render them very smooth. 

To Prevent Moths in Carpets, wash the floor, before laying 
them, with spirits of turpentine or benzine. 

To Keep Lemons Fresh place them in a jar filled with water, to 
be renewed every day or two. 

Dry Paint can be softened and removed by an application, with a 
swab, of a strong solution of oxalic acid. 

To Clean Sea-Shells. — Fresh-water shells can be cleaned by 
soaking them in a solution of chloride of lime and polishing them 
with pumice-stone. 

Keeping Meat Fresh in Hot Weather. — Place it in a clean 
porcelain bowl, and pour very hot water over it so as to cover it ; 
then pour oil on the water. The air is thus excluded and the meat 
is preserved. 

To Make Hens Lay in Winter. — Keep them warm, and give 
them daily fresh meat ; do not feed them corn in the usual manner, 
but keep it by them constantly. 

Cheap Soft Soap. — Take a clean barrel, the size of a kerosene-oil 
barrel, and in the bottom place ten or fifteen pounds of barrel-potash, 
and fifteen pounds of rendered fat or tallow. Upon this pour three pail- 
fuls of boiling hot water (soft water). Let it stand twenty-four hours, 
and add two pailfuls of boiling soft water, and continue to add a like 
amount once a day till the barrel is full. Stir it often to make it white. 

Soft Soap [excellent recipe). — To one pound of concentrated lye 
add three gallons of water and four pounds of fat ; put them in a tin 
boiler and boil five hours ; then add twelve gallons of water and boil 
the whole a few minutes. Let it stand till cold and it is ready for 
use. 

To Make Hard Soap. — Of course, the whiter the grease, the

554 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

nicer the soap. Take six pounds of sal-soda, six pounds of grease, 
three and a-half pounds of new-stone hme, four gallons of soft water, 
and half a pound of borax. Put soda, lime and water into an iron 
boiler, and boil till all is dissolved. When well settled, pour off the 
clear lye, wash out the kettle and put in the lye, grease and borax ; 
boil till it comes to soap ; pour into a tub to cool, and, when hard, 
cut into bars and put on boards to dry. 

Easter Eggs. — Save egg shells for moulds, break the small end of 
the shell carefully with some sharp instrument and allow the egg to 
run out. Make a stiff cornstarch blanc-mange ; after placing the 
shells in a pan of salt so that they will stand, fill them and set them 
away ; when cold and firm remove the shells and you will have per- 
fect eggs. To make colored ones, stir in jelly of any kind while the 
blanc-mange is hot, or make chocolate blanc-mange. 

ODDS AND ENDS FOR HOUSEHOLD USE. 
If brooms are wet in boiling suds once a week they will become 
very tough, will not cut out a carpet, but last much longer, and 
always sweep like a new broom — clean. A handful or two of 
damp salt sprinkled on the carpet, will attract and absorb the dust, 
artd carry it along with it, and make the carpet look fresh as new. 
V^'et corn-meal is also excellent and serves the same purpose. So 
do damp cabbage-leaves cut up small, if no other means are at 
hind. Snow used in the same way in a cold room also improves 
the carpet. The broom wears out carpets quite as much as feet 
do. A very dusty carpet may be cleaned by setting a pail of cold 
water outside the, door, wet the broom in it, knock it to get off all 
the drops, sweep a yard or so, then wash the broom and sweep 
again, so on till the whole is done. It is surprising how much dirt 
will be found in the water, which should be changed three or four 
times if the carpet is very soiled. Another good way to clean car- 
pets is to add two large spoonfuls of ammonia to one gallon of cold 
water, ring out Canton flannel cloths in this mixture, and rub the 
carpet with the damp cloth. See the cloth is not too wet, and dry 
off' the carpet with a dry cloth.

Tea-leaves, or any kind of leaves, or bran, scattered over the floor 
will keep the dust down. 

Never use a broom for any other purpose that you use upon a 
carpet. 

Old papers are excellent to put the polish on tin-ware, cutlery, 
silver spoons, and to renew the polish of stoves and ranges that are 
strangers to the " Rising Sun " polish or any other. Nothing, not 
even chamois skin, is as good as newspaper for polishing mirrors 
after they have been first wiped off with a cloth wrung out of strong 
suds. The same may be said of window-glass. Benzine and com- 
mon clay will clean marble. Strong soda-water, if left to remain 
half an hour on the spots, will generally remove them. 

To clean ste^l or iron, make a paste of two ounces soft soap, and 
two of coarse emery powder and two of fine, apply; allow to remain 
a while, then rub off with wash-leather. For polishing steel, crocus 
powder, moistened with sweet-oil, is best. "An ounce of prevention 
is WjOrth a pound of cure," and if steel fire-sets and any steel articles 
that are to be put away for the season are well rubbed in sweet-oil, 
and .done up in soft brown paper, they will keep free from rust. To 
clean paint there is nothing more labor-saving than common whiting. 
Use a flannel cloth, clean warm water; squeeze the cloth nearly dry; 
then take as much whiting as will adhere to it, rub the paint, then 
wash off with clean water, dry with a chamois. Paint thus cleaned 
looks as well as when first laid on, without any injury to the most 
delicate colors. It is far better than using soap, and does not require 
half the time or labor. Gray marble hearths may be rubbed with 
linseed-oil, and no spots will show. Kerosene and powdered lime, 
whiting or wood-ashes will scour tins with the least labor. Wooden 
bowls or trays if well rubbed, inside and out with lard or any clear 
grease, before ever using, will never crack. 

Camphor placed in drawers or trunks will prevent mice from 
doing them any injury. 

Offensive cistern-water may be purified by sinking a bag of pow- 
dered charcoal in it.

To purify a pitcher of water, attach a plum-sized lump of alum to 
a string and swing slowly around in it for a few times and all the 
sediment will soon fall to the bottom. 

The ivory keys to a piano which have become yellow, may be 
made white again by washing them with a sponge diluted with sul- 
phurous acid, or a solution of hyposulphate of soda, and then expose 
the keys to the sun. 

To remove the white spots which often seriously injure the ap- 
pearance of a dining or other table, pour some lamp-oil on the spot 
and rub it hard with a soft cloth ; then pour on a little cologne and 
rub it dry with another cloth. 

Varnished paints, window-panes and mirrors, can be much better 
washed with the liquid saved from tea-leaves than with water. Save 
the tea-leaves for a few days, then steep them in a tin-pail or pan for 
half an hour, strain through a sieve, and the liquid will be found to 
be excellent for the purpose named. It acts as a strong detergeirt, 
cleansing the paint from all its impurities and making the varnish 
equal to new. It will not do to wash unvarnished paint with it as it 
would take the paint off. 

To remove grease from carpets, cover the grease spot with whiting, 
and let it remain until it becomes saturated with grease; then scrape 
it off, and cover with another coat of whiting, and if it does not re- 
move the grease, repeat the application. Three coats of whiting will, 
in most cases, remove the grease, when it should be brushed off with 
a clothes-brush. 

A strong solution of carbolic acid and water poured into holes, 
kills all the ants it touches, and the survivors immediately take

When washing oil-cloths, put a little milk in the last water they 
are washed with. This will keep them bright and clean longer than 
clear water. 

Grained wood should be washed with cold tea. 

Ceilings that have been smoked by a kerosene-lamp should be

Moths will eat the all-wool reps, but not the mixed silk and cot-

To polish brass, rub the metal with rotten-stone and sweet-oil, 
then rub off with a piede of cotton-flannel, and polish with soft 
leather. A solution of oxalic acid removes the tarnish, rendering 
the metal bright. The acid must be washed off with water, and the 
brass rubbed with whiting and soft leather. A mixture of muriatic 
acid and alum dissolved in water, imparts a golden color to brass 
articles that are steeped in it for a few days. 

The government recipe for cleaning brass, used in the arsenals, is 
said to be as follows: Make a mixture of one part cornmon nitric 
acid, and one-half part sulphuric acid in a stone jar; then place ready 
a pail of fresh water and a box of sawdust. Dip the articles to be 
cleaned in the acid, then remove them into the water, after which 
rub them with sawdust. This immediately changes them to a bril- 
liant color. If the brass is greasy it must be first dipped in a strong 
solution of potash and soda in warm water, this cuts the grease so 
tl^at the acid has the power to act. 

Rusted steel can be cleaned by washing with a solution of half an 
ounce of cyanide of potassium in two ounces of water, and then 
brushing with a paste composed of half an ounce of cyanide of potas- 
sium, half an ounce of castile soap, an ounce of whiting and suffi- 
cient water to make the paste. 

A little spirits of turpentine added to the water with which floors 
are washed will prevent the ravages of moths. 

Salt and water is an excellent thing to clean cane-seated chairs. 
Use a great deal, so that the cane will be thoroughly saturated, and 
scrub with a brush if the seat is much soiled. Turn the chair upside 
down, to get at the unvarnished side of the cane, as the varnish will 
resist water. The object of soaking it is to shrink the cane. Wipe 
it and stand the chair in the sun to dry, and the seat will tighten up 
and be as firm as when bought, unless some of the strands are 
broken.

chips in water, making a very strong decoction, and then sweetening 
the hquid with treacle or sugar. This fly-poison may be used with 
safety, as it is not injurious to human beings. * 

Marble of any kind may be repolished by rubbing it with a linen 
cloth, dressed with oxide of tin (sold under the name of putty-pow- 
der). For this purpose a couple or more folds of linen should be fas- 
tened tight over a piece of wood, flat or otherwise, according to the 
form of the stone. To repolish first a mantelpiece, it should be per- 
fectly cleaned. This is best done by making a paste of lime, soda and 
water, wetting well the marble, and applying the paste. Then let it 
remain for a day or so, keeping it moist during the interval. When 
this paste has been removed, the polishing may begin. Chips in the- 
marble should be rubbed out first with emery and water. At every 
stage of polishing, the linen and putty-powder must be kept constantly 
wet. 

It is a common household experience to find the caps of glass cans 
of fruit so firmly screwed on that they cannot be removed by the hand. 
A cloth dipped in hot water and applied to the outside of the cap will 
cause it to expand, when it will come off without effort. 

When boots and shoes not in use are deposited in a damp place 
they become covered ordinarily with mould, which attacks the leather ; 
when deposited in a dry place they become hard and wrinkled — a fact 
well known to all, although the remedy may not be. This double 
disadvantage may be avoided if the articles are first rubbed with a 
rag on which a few drops of oil of turpentine have been sprinkled. 
The oil of turpentine acts favorably as a preservative to the leather, 
and is a deterrent to rats and mice, whose depredations are often as 
injurious as those of temperature. 

Fly spots can be removed with a camel's-hair brush dipped into 
spirits of wine, and thus applied to the spots. 

In cleaning furniture, rub the surface with a wet cloth to wipe off 
the grease, with a small piece of washing-soda in the water; dry 
it ; then rub it with raw linseed oil ; then rub with gum-shellac 
(which is sold at the paint-shops) ; then rub with an old silk kerchief.

Dusting articles of steel, after they have been thoroughly cleaned, 
with unslaked lime will preserve them from rust. The coils of piano- 
wire thus sprinkled will keep from rust many years. 

To whiten walls, scrape off all the old whitewash, and wash the 
walls with a solution of two ounces of white vitriol to four gallons of 
water. Soak a quarter of a pound of white glue in water for twelve 
hours ; strain and place in a tin pail ; cover with fresh water, and set 
the pail in a kettle of boiling water. When melted stir in the glue 
eight pounds of whiting, and water enough to make it as thick as 
common whitewash. Apply evenly with a good brush. If the walls 
are very yellow, blue the water slightly by squeezing in it a flannel 
blue-bag. 

Whiting wet with aqua ammonia will cleanse brass from stains, 
and is excellent for polishing taps and door knobs of brass or silver. 

Soot falling on the carpet from open chimneys or carelessly han- 
dled stove-papers, if covered thickly with salt, can be brushed up 
without injury to the carpet. 

If you have a brass tea kettle it is all the rage now to bring it in 'to 
the table while you make the afternoon tea, and it must be polished 
so that it shines like gold. Buy five cents' worth of oxalic acid, put 
it in an ordinary wine bottle, and fill up with cold water ; when dis- 
solved, rub the kettle with a cloth dipped in the solution. Elbow- 
grease is the only other necessitj', and if plenty of it is used, the result 
will be wonderful. The kettle must be perfectly cold while cleaning. 
An objection to this method of scouring is that if the oxalic acid is 
brought into immediate contact with the hands and nails, it produces 
an injurious effect on them, which is certainly undesirable. Care 
should therefore be taken that the scouring cloth be large enough to 
prevent such results. A preparation, that requires a little more labor 
but is equally efficacious, consists of a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in 
vinegar and applied in the same way as the other. Do not leave it 
where little fingers can get it, for the preparation (the acid) is rank 
poison.

Hartshorn is one of the best possible ingredients for plate-powder 
in daily use. It leaves on the silver a deep, dark polish, and is less 
hurtful than any other article. To wash plate carefully is first to 
remove all the grease from it, and this can be done with the use oF 
warm water and soap. The water should be as nearly hot as the 
hand can bear it. Then mix as much hartshorn-powder as will be 
required into a thick paste with cold water. Smear this lightly over 
the plate with a piece of soft rag, and leave it for some little time to 
dry. When perfectly dry, brush it off quite clean with a soft plate- 
brush, and polish the plate with a dry leather. If the plate be very 
dirty or much tarnished, spirits of wine will be found to answer bet- 
ter than the water for mixing the paste. 

For plate rags nothing is better than the tops of old cotton stock- 
ings, and these should be boiled in a mixture of new milk and harts- 
horn-powder for about five minutes, rinsing them as soon as they are 
taken out for a moment in cold water, and dry them before the fire. 
With these rags rub the plate briskly as soon as it has been well 
washed and dried after daily use. A most beautiful, deep polish will 
be produced, and the plate will require nothing more than merely to 
be dusted with a leather or dry, soft cloth before it is again put upon 
the table. 

In cleaning decanters, roll up in small pieces some soft brown or 
blotting-paper; wet them, and soap them well. Put them into the 
decanters about one-quarter full of warm water; shake them well for 
a few minutes, then rinse with clear, cold water; wipe the outsides 
with a nice dry cloth, put the decanters to drain, and when dry, they 
will be almost as bright as new ones. 

Broken glass may be repaired by joming the pieces very neatly 
together with a cement made as follows : Dissolve an ounce of gum-

ounce of isinglass in warm water, and, finally, dissolve it in brandy 
till it forms a thick jelly; mix the isinglass and gum-mastic together, 
adding a quarter of an ounce of finely powdered gum-ammoniac; 
put the whole into an earthen pipkin, and in a warm place, till they 
are thoroughly incorporated together; pour it into a small vial, and 
cork it down for use. In using it dissolve a small piece of the 
cement in a silver teaspoon over a lighted candle. The broken 
pieces of glass or china being warmed and touched with the now 
liquid cement, join the parts neatly together and hold in their places 
till the, cement has set; then wipe away the cement adhering to the 
edge of the joint, and leave it for twelve hours without touching it; 
the joint will be as strong as the china itself, and if neatly done it 
will show no joining. 

It may be of some value to housekeepers who have marble-top 
furniture to know that the common solution of gum-arabic is an ex- 
cellent absorbent, and will remove dirt, etc., from marble. 

The method of applying it is as follows : Brush the dust off the 
piece to be cleaned, then apply with a brush a good coat of gum- 
arabic, about the consistency of thick office mucilage, expose it to 
the sun or dry wind, or both. In a short time it will crack and peel 
off If all the gum should not peel off, wash it with clean water and 
a clean cloth. Of course, if the first application does not have the 
desired effect it shoujd be applied again. Another method of clean- 
ing marble is to make a paste with soft soap and whiting, wash the 
marble with it and then leave a coat of paste upon it for two or three 
days. Afterwards wash off with warm (not hot) water and soap. 

To soften resin, melt the resin, and while in a state of fusion add 
tar. The proper degree of hardness can be ascertained by dropping 
a small portion of the melted mass into water. 

To render pencil maAs indelible, take well-skimmed milk, and 
dilute with an equal bolk of water. Wash the pencil marks, whether 
writing or drawing, with this liquid, using a soft flat carriel-hair

To remove grease from marble, take French chalk reduced to

powder, dust it over the spot, and then hold a hot flat-iron very near 
to it. This will soften the grease, while the chalk will absorb it. 

A few drops of oil of cloves, alcohol, or acid will preserve a quart

A small quantity of dissolved alum will preserve flour paste. 

Use kerosene, or bath-brick, or powdered lime to scour iron, tin

For silvering glass globes, etc. To half an ounce of lead add half 
an ounce of fine tin, and melt them together in an iron ladle; when in 
a state of fusion, add half an ounce of bismuth, skim off the dross, re- 
move the ladle from the fire, and before it solidifies add five ounces 
of quicksilver, and stir the whole well together, being careful not to 
breathe over it, as the fumes of the quicksilver are very injurious. 
The operation should be performed under a hood communicating 
with a chimney of good draft, to carry off the vapors. Or, to four 
ounces of quicksilver put as much tin-foil as will become barely 
fluid when mixed. Have the globe clean, dry and warm, and inject 
the metal by means of a clean glass or eai-then pipe at the aperture, 
turning it about until it is silvered all over ; let the remainder run out, 
and the operation is finished. 

CEMENTS, PASTES, ETC. 

The strongest known glue is that made from the skins and sounds 
of fishes, and the strongest of this class is made in Lapland from the 
skin of a perch. The Laplanders use it in making their bows, which 
are both strong and durable. In making it their cold climate is 
greatly in their favor ; here a fishskin will begin to undergo decom- 
position before it can be dried. 

In making it the skins are put into a bladder, which answers for a 
water bath, and heated in water until a sort of glue results. This 
glue is, as may be imagined, very elastic. Isinglass is a very strong 
glue, made from skins, sounds, etc., of fishes ; it is very liable to be 
spoiled in making by overheating. 

The pastes are all made from starch in some of its forms. Gluten 



MISCELLANEOUS HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 563 

is also used for a paste, but starch is the best. All additions of resin, 
etc., commonly recommended are a damage to paste. 

Dextrine, or " British gum," is of immense value in the arts as a 
cement. It is derived from starch by roasting or by the action of 
nitric acid. It was discovered by accidental overheating of starch, 
and its process of manufacture was for a long time kept secret. Its 
chief use for a long time was in the cotton manufacture. It is the 
standard gum for postage stamps, though it is said that gum arable 
and cheaper substitutes are used in this country. 

No cement can be fireproof which contains organic matter, since 
this is decomposed at a temperature about that of melting lead, or say, 
600° Fahrenheit. Cements containing oils. will not be fireproof 

Silicate of soda mixed with asbestos is the nearest to a fire-proof 
cement. It will stand a low, red heat. It is decomposed at a bright 
red. 

Cement cracks when it is made up with too much water. It then 
forms a vitreous crust, and is not homogeneous throughout its mass. 
By adding finely crushed granite fragments to cement without sand, a 
material is obtained that has great hardness, and which is susceptible 
of taking a high polish. 

A paste made of whiting and benzine will clean marble, and one 
made of whiting and chloride of soda spread and left to dry (in the - 
sun if possible) on the marble will remove spots. 

Cement for Labels, — i. Macerate five parts of glue in eighteen 
parts of water. Boil and add nine parts rock candy and five parts 
gum arable. 2. Mix dextrine with water and add a drop or two of 
glycerine. 3. A mixture of one part of dry chloride of calcium, or 
two parts of the same salt in the crystallized form, and thirty-six parts 
of gum arable,* dissolved in water to a proper consistency, form a 
mucilage which holds well, does not crack by drying, and yet does 
not attract sufiRcient moisture from the air to become wet in damp 
weather. 4. For attaching labels to tin and other bright metallic sur- 
faces, first rub the surface with a mixture of muriatic acid and alco- 
hol ; then apply the label with a very thin coating of the paste, and it

will adhere almost as well as on glass. 5. To make cement for at- 
taching labels to metals, take ten parts tragacanth mucilage, ten parts 
of honey and one part flour. The flour appears to hasten the drying 
and renders it less susceptible to damp. Another cement that will 
resist the damp still better, but will not adhere if the surface is greasy, 
is made by boiling together two parts shellac, one part borax and six- 
teen parts water. 

Cement for Jars and Bottles. — Use one-fourth beeswax and 
three-fourths resin, melted together. 

Mucilage of Gum Arabic. — Gum arable, twelve troy ounces ; 
glycerine, eight fluid ounces ; water, sixteen ounces. 

To Cement Wood to Glass. — Make a solution of isinglass in 
acetic acid so thick as to be solid when cold. Heat this and apply it. 
It will adhere firmly, uniting both materials equally. 

Rubber Cement. — A cement of this kind, that is recommended as 
being economical and excellent, is made by cutting a quantity of pure 
India-rubber, in its natural state, into small pieces, putting them in a 
wide-mouthed bottle, and filling it about half-full of the purest ben- 
zine ; the rubber will swell up almost immediately, and, if w.ell 
shaken, will, in a few days, assume the consistency of honey. If the 
rubber does not dissolve, add more benzine. If, when dissolved, the 
cement is too thin, add more gum. A piece of rubber one inch in 
diameter will make a pint of cement. This dries in a few minutes, 
and is very useful in uniting pieces of leather, as it is both elastic and 
durable. 

Cement for Leather and Cloth. — An adhesive material for 
uniting the parts of boots and shoes, and for the seams of articles of 
clothing, may be made thus : Take one pound of gutta percha, four 
ounces of India-rubber, two ounces of pitch, one ounce of shellac, two 
ounces of oil. The ingredients are to be melted together and used 
hot. 

Strong Glue can be made by adding powdered chalk to common 
glue. 

For Crockery. — A good cement for mending broken crockery-

ivare may be made by mixing together equal quantities of melted 
glue, white of egg and white lead, and boiling them together. 

To Obtain Paste for Paper. — To ten parts by weight of gum 
arabic add three parts of sugar in order to prevent the gum from 
cracking ; then add water until the desired consistency is obtained. 
If a very strong paste is required, add a quantity of flour equal in 
weight to the gum, without boiling the mixture. The paste improves 
in strength when it begins to ferment. 

For Paper. — The best paste for attaching paper is made by mixing 
a small quantity of water and flour together, stirring it well until all 
the lumps are dissolved, and then set it away to cool. In pasting 
slips in scrap-books, it is recommended as the only kind of paste that 
does not draw the sheets when dry. 

Rye flour, boiled in water, with a little alum added while boiling, 
makes an adhesive paste almost as strong as glue. 

China and Glass Cement. — To one pint of milk add one pint of 
vinegar ; separate the curds from the whey, and mix the whey with 
the whites of five eggs ; beat it well together, sifting into it a suffi- 
cient quantity of quick lime to convert it into a thick paste. Broken 
china or glass mended with this cement will not again separate, and 
will resist the action of fire and water. 

Milk Cement. — It may not be well known that new milk makes a 
good cement for broken crockery. .One good method of using it is to 
snugly tie together the different parts and lay in the pail while milking. 
After thoroughly drying, the pieces will be found to be firmly united, 
and will remain together a long time if not soaked. Another way is 
to take warm, fresh milk and turn into a basin over the fire ; into this 
lay any dish or toy, firmly tied together with thread or twine. Heat 
until scalding hot, remove and dry. 

Common Cement, such as is used for plastering cisterns, cellars, 
etc., is excellent for scouring knives, forks, spoons and tinware.

days after cemented. 

HINTS TO HOUSEKEEPERS. 

It is a good plan for a housekeeper to make a weekly visit to 
every part of her dwelling from garret to cellar. 

To TAKE Grease from Boards. — ^Put over the grease a thick paste 
of fuller's-earth, leave it on for some hours, wash off with hot water, 
put fresh fuller's-earth if the grease is not sufficiently abso/bed, scrub 
after with silver-sand. Never use soap to boards if you desire to 
keep them looking well. 

It is said two parts tallow and one of resin, melted together and 
applied to the soles of new boots or shoes, as much as the leather 
will absorb, will double their wear. 

The detergent properties of water-glass make it an excellent 
scouring material, and it enters largely into the composition of most 
common soaps. 

Bed-bugs cannot hold out, if their haunts are treated occasionally 
to an application of corrosive sublimate, ten cents worth put in a pint 
of alcohol or spirits of turpentine. Apply with a feather, and keep 
the mixture out of the reach of children. 

It is said that if a few drops of oil are put once a week into water- 
tanks mosquitoes will be prevented from breeding in them. 

Pitch-paper, the same as that used in covering roofs, when cut 
into slips and placed in convenient situations under carpets and 
behind sofas and chairs in a room, will effectually repel the moth- 
miller from depositing its eggs. If similar strips are placed insicie 
the backs and seats of parlor suits, they will render the furniture 
moth-proof 

It is a good plan to have the dining-room and kitchen swept 
before other work is done ; there is less danger of spots being made 
on carpet or floor. Many grease-spots are made for which no one is 
accountable, simply by crumbs being stepped on and crushed. W

hot grease is spilled on the floor or carpet, without losing a minute 
pour some cold water on it ; it can then be scraped off with a knife 
and the traces easily removed ; but if left to penetrate soft wood or 
to spread on the carpet it will take a much longer time. This is one 
of many cases in which a " stitch in time saves nine." 

Varnish used in pottery decoration should not be too thin. It 
will give better satisfaction if it is applied warm. It can be heated 
by placing the jar containing it into a larger one filled with boiling 
water. By no means set it on the fire. 

A CHEAP PAINT is made for brick walls by simply mixing up good 
hydraulic cement in water, and applying with a whitewash-brush. 
The natural tint is neutral and pleasing, but may readily be varied- 
This paint cannot be washed off by storms nor peeled off by the sun. 

The lustre of morocco leather is restored by varnishing with 
white of egg. 

When putting away the silver tea or coffee-pot which is not used 
every day, lay a little stick across the top under the cover ; this will 
allow fresh air to get in, and will prevent mustiness ; it will then be 
ready for use at any time, after havjng first been thoroughly rinsed 
with boiling water. 

All sorts of vessels and utensils may be purified from long- 
retained smells of every kind, in the easiest and most perfect manner, 
by rinsing them out well with charcoal powder, after the grosser im- 
purities have been scoured off. 

Old paint pails and cans may be thoroughly cleaned with strong, 
hot lye. 

An English journal gives the following recipe for cleaning plaster 
casts : Make a thin solution of starch, and with a brush entirely cover 
the surface of the plaster ; leave it to dry for about three days, and 
then peel it off carefully. 

How TO Treat Old Mirrors. — A novel way of treating old mir- 
rors whose frames are either ugly or have ceased to be ornamental,

paints, putting them on thickly and mottling them, at alternate cor- 
ners having the colors deeper and tending toward the opposite cor- 
ners in lighter tints. Among the suitable tints are deep olive 
browns or greens working up toward white. Then decorate boldly 
with snow-balls hanging over one end, the foliage running lightly 
to the oftposite corner ; while another bunch is painted below. The 
decoration should always be irregular, yet perfectly balanced. 

Cellars thoroughly treated with whitewash made yellow with 
copperas will not be considered desirable habitations for rats and 
mice. 

A SOLUTION OF COPPERAS or green vitriol, sprinkled over the floor 
from time to time, makes a good disinfectant. 

The best duster with which to clean carved furniture is a new 
paint-brush ; it will remove all the dust with it. 

Cloths to hang on walls behind wash-stands, are now embroi- 
dered with colors on coarse linen, edged with a coarse lace or 
fringed. Chair tidies, toilet table-covers and sideboard cloth are 
worked the same way. A sideboard cloth is made of coarse white 
linen, long and narrow, with ends hanging well over the side. Work 
only the ends. Draw out the threads to form small squares ; above 
these lightly trace a braiding pattern, and work this in rather large 
cross-stitch with coarse red flosette. The coarse worsted lace dou- 
ble run with red; a narrow pattern with cross-stitch worked run 
along the whole length of the cloth. 

Putting up Curtains. — When putting up curtains which are to be 
draped, in a low room, put the cornice, to which the curtain is to be 
fastened, close to the ceiling, even if the window is put in lower 
down, as it gives the effect of greater height to the room. The cur- 
tains meeting at the top will conceal the wall. 

How to Color a Pine Floor where Rugs are to be Used. — 
Buy at any house-painter's store turpentine and linseed-oil (not 
boiled). Ask them to put a little Japanese dryer in the turpentine. 
Buy either burnt sienna or Vandyke brown, or both, according to 
the color of the rugs and the tint on the walls. These colors come

put Up in tin-cans, smaller but otherwise similar to tomato or fruit- 
cans. After your floor has been washed thoroughly clean, is free 
from diist, and dry, begin by opening your can and mixing, in an- 
other receptacle, the oil, turpentine and paint. Remember, the oil 
is to thin your paint, the turpentine to dry it. The mixture should 
be so thin that it will run with liquid readiness. Lay it on with a 
brush as thick as your hand, stroking the brush the way of the grain 
of the wood. Protect your hands with old gloves, and go over the 
floor with a rag. In fact you will need two rags, one pretty well 
charged with paint, to rub in every crevice, and another rag to rub 
off any superfluous paint. Mind your stops, or, rather, put some 
mind in the way you stop. Do not stop in a straight line across the 
grain of the wood, but carry your brush irregularly down, taking a 
hint from nature's lines in the wood you are preserving with paint. 
By mixing the burnt sienna and Vandyke brown, you will secure a 
rich color without needing to use the paint in a thick form. Your 
mixture should be so thin that the grain of the wood will show 
through. If you have too much turpentine, the paint will rub off. 
If you have too little, your room will need more days to dry. 
' Twice as much oil as turpentine, certainly. Do not economize the 
oil, and be as prodigal in rubbing as your strength will permit. To 
keep the gloss on a stained floor wipe up the floor with diluted but- 
termilk or sour milk. 

How TO Use Lamps. — To have your light safe, clear and beautiful 
— in the first place buy tested kerosene from a reliable dealer, and 
beware of the cheap oils that agents peddle around. They are nearly 
all benzine, gasoline or naphtha, and are dangerous as gunpowder. 
The best kerosene is clear as water, and will not flash when a match 
is applied to it. Fill and trim your lamps every day. When a half- 
empty lamp is lighted, the gas in the space above the oil expands 
with the heat and an explosion often follows. Wash chimneys and 
lamp bowls in warm soap-suds, and wipe clear with old fine muslin 
cloths (worn-out pillow-cases do nicely). Trim all the cinders off the 
wick, rounding the corners a little with an old pair of scissors kept 
36 



S70 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

for that purpose. Have a place for cloths, scissors, etc., and always 
put them there. Your wiping cloths must be perfectly clean and 
dry if you want your chimneys to look nice. If the chimneys are 
not smoky or smeared, simply breathing on them or holding them 
over steam and polishing is sufficient. Handle carefully by top or 
bottom, so that there will be no finger tracks. Flat chimneys are 
best. About once a month, or whenever sediment begins to collect 
in the bowls, empty and strain the oil, wash out the bowls thoroughly 
with hot soap-suds, wipe clear and bright with a long strip of rag 
pushed in with a stick ; wash the burners clean ; if burnt black, scour 
with ashes ; put in fresh wicks ; fill with clean oil, and your lamps 
will be a joy forever. If the dirty wicks are long enough to save, 
wash, rinse and dry for future use. Canton flannel folded three times 
width-ways, and stitched on either edge with the machine, makes 
excellent wicks, the cost being next to nothing. If your oil-can is 
empty, and you live far from town, raise the oil in your lamps with 
water. Of course you have to keep on filling with water till the oil 
is all gone. Five minutes' work on a lamp every day will make it 
shining clean, then put it out of the way of dust and flies. If the 
busy house-mother cannot find the time, any child ten years old can 
be taught to take care of the lamps neatly and carefully. A small 
lamp is better than a candle to carry around, there being no danger 
from sparks, or curtains and clothing coming in contact with the 
flame. Where there is a family of small children, bracket and hang- 
ing lamps arc safest. Never turn the lamp down and leave it burn- 
ing. It will fill a room with poisonous gas in a few minutes. It 
must either be high and bright or extinguished. Where a very dim 
light is necessary, put a tube of stiff paper over the lamp. 

To prevent lamp-chimneys and glassware from cracking put them 
into a pot filled with cold water, to which some common table salt 
has been added. The water is well boiled over a fire, and then 
allowed to cool slowly. 

Common Soda is the best thing for cleaning tinware. Dampen a 
cloth and dip in soda, and rub the ware briskly, after which wipe dry, 
and it will look equal to new.

Sugar-barrels and boxes can be freed from ants by drawing a 
chalk-mark just around the edge of the top of them. The mark 
must be half an inch wide and unbroken. A continuous mark will 
entirely deter them. 

To prevent silverware from tarnishing, the articles should be 
warmed, and then painted over with a solution of collodion in alcohol^ 
using a wide, soft brush for the purpose. 

To prevent iron from rusting, warm it, then rub white wax on it. 
Put it again to the fire, until the wax has pervaded the entire surface. 

If stove-polish is mixed with very strong soap-suds, the lustre 
appears immediately, and the dust of the polish does not fly around 
as it usually does. 

To Perfume Note-paper, etc. — Get a few quires of blotting-paper, 
sprinkle the sheets with the perfume desired ; then put the blotting 
under a weight until it becomes dry. When dry, put note-paper, 
envelopes, etc.,. between the sheets, and place them under a weight 
for a few hours ; remove them, and they will be found perfumed. 
The blotting sheets may be utilized again, and can be made to retain 
their perfume for a long time, by keeping them free from exposure to 
air. 

How to Drive Nails. — It seems a simple and easy enough matter 
to drive a nail, but not one person in a thousand can drive one with 
the greatest possible effect where considerable skill and judgment are 
needed to this end. Most mechanics whose peculiar trade requires 
the frequent exercise of this operation, neglect to study the subject 
properly, and drive a considerable percentage of their nails in an in- 
efficient and useless manner. And amateurs, whose operations are 
usually upon subjects of the most difficult kind, almost invariably fail, 
usually doing more harm than good, by splitting the wood and ren- 
dering it more difficult for the most skilful to insert a reliable nail. 
Examine any article of domestic use that has been repaired with nails 
by amateurs, and you will probably find that a large majority of them 
do more harm than good. Yet a little judgment and thought upon 
the subject would direct us where and how to insert a nail in any 



572 THE hearthstone; or, life at home. 

difficult case, so as to have the desired effect. In naiHng boards upon 
timbers, the simplest and plainest of all the various phases of nail-, 
driving, at least one in ten is usually lost by carelessness on the part 
of the operator, or defect in the nails themselves. And in the more 
difficult operations, as of box-maker's or joiner's work, a much larger 
percentage of waste is suffered. In an average lot of window frames, 
at least one nail in five, or twenty per cent, of all, will be found to be 
so driven as to be useless. Nails ought to and will ultimately be 
made chisel-pointed. They penetrate easier, drive straighter, and 
hold firmer than square-pointed ones. But the pointing must be 
done perfectly ; otherwise it induces deflection and misdirection in 
driving. Nails pointed in cutting are quite certain to get enough 
ruggedness or irregularity at the extreme point to effect deflection, 
like the rudder of a ship. The pointing, to have the requisite accuracy, 
must be done upon the filing principle, which involves, however, too 
great a complication of machinery. 

Take coach varnish and renew all your oil-cloths. Wash them 
clean, wipe dry, and apply a coat of varnish. Be careful not to step 
on them until they are dry. If this is done once a year, the oil-cloths 
will last twice as long as they will without it. 

Furniture Polish (i). — Make a mixture of three parts linseed-oil 
and one part spirits of turpentine ; it not only covers the disfigured sur- 
face, but restores wood to its original color, and leaves a lustre upon 
the surface. Put on with a woollen cloth, and when dry rub with 
woollen. 

Furniture Polish (2). — Beeswax, half a pound; alkanet-root, 
quarter of an ounce ; melt together in a pipkin until the former is well 
colored ; then add linseed-oil and spirits of turpentine, of each a 
quarter of a gill ; strain through a piece of coarse muslin. 

Another ReCipe. — Mix half a pint of olive-oil with one pound of 
soft soap. Boil them well, and apply the mixture to your oiled fur- 
niture with a piece of cotton or woollen cloth. Polish with a soft, 
dry flannel. 

To Clean Silver. — Never put a particle of soap on silverware, if 



MISCELLANEOUS HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 573 

you would have it retain its lustre. Soap-suds make it look like 
pewter. Wet a flannel cloth in kerosene, dip it in dry whiting, and 
rub the plated ware. Let it dry on it, and then polish it with a 
chamois-skin. 

Cleaning Kettles. — Throw . a shovelful of wood-ashes into the 
pcin, pot, or kettle which has been burned ; fill with water ; let it boil 
while the dishes are being washed. Then wash it with a coarse 
cloth ; this plan will be found to be a great saving of hands, spoons 
and temper. 

A Forgotten Color. — The simple decoction of onion-peel is said 
to produce upon glove-leather an orange-yellow superior in lustre to 
any other. It is also said to be suitable for mixing with light bark 
shades, especially willow-bark, and as a yellow for modulating 
browns. The onion-dye is said to fix itself readily, even upon leath- 
ers which resist colors, and colors them well and evenly. 

To Mend Broken Ivory. — Moisten thoroughly a small quantity 
of very finely-powdered good quicklime with white of egg to form a 
paste. Use at once, clamp the parts, and do not disturb for twenty- 
four hours. Do not use an excess of the cement. 

The Best Ink.^A commission lately appointed by the Prussian 
government to investigate the best class of inks to be employed for 
official purposes, state that aniline inks are not suitable, because 
they can be easily washed away, especially by preparations of chlo- 
rine. Inks, in the composition of which alizarine is employed, can be 
obliterated less easily. They are of opinion that the best of all is 
the old description of ink made from gall-nuts and salt of iron. 

Boiled Starch is improved by the addition of a little spermaceti, 
or salt, or both, or gum-arabic dissolved. Bees-wax and salt will 
make flat-irons as smooth as glass ; tie a lump of wax in a cloth, and 
keep it for that purpose ; when the irons are hot rub them with the 
wax-rag, then scour with a paper or rag sprinkled with salt. Kero- 
sene will soften, boots or shoes hardened by water, and render them 
as pliable as when new. Kerosene will make tin-kettles as bright 
as new ; saturate a woollen rag, and rub with it ; it will also remove

stains from varnished furniture. If a shirt-bosom, or any other arti- 
cle, has been scorched in ironing, lay it where the bright sun will fall 
directly on it, it will take it entirely out. 

To Clean Coral. — Soak it in soda and water for some hours. 
Then make a lather of soap, and with a soft hair-brush rub the coral 
lightly, letting the brush enter all the interstices. Pour off the water 
and replenish it with clean constantly, and then let the coral dry in 
the sun. 

Enamelling on Wood. — For enamelling on wood in black for 
parlor-organ stops, door-knobs and the like, take of seed-lac and 
pale resin, each two ounces ; alcohol, one pint. Warm the wood in 
an oven, apply the varnish quickly and evenly ; let dry ; give another 
coat, and when dry rub down with pumice-stone. For a black body, 
dissolve four ounces shellac in one pint of alcohol, and mix up to 
color with ivory-black in impalpable powder ; give the work one or 
more flowing coats of this, and heat in an oven (gradually) to about 
400° Fahrenheit, for half an hour. After cooling somewhat give a 
flowing coat of pale spirit-opal varnish, harden again in the oven, and 
polish with felt and tripoli, finishing with a trace of oil. For white 
ground mix washed flake white with one-sixth its weight of starch, 
grind very finely, and temper with mastic varnish. Harden by heat, and 
lay on five coats of the following: Seed-lac, two ounces; gum anime, 
three ; coarsely powder, dissolve in one quart of alcohol, and strain. 
Harden and polish as before, using putty powder. 

For Cleaning Silver or silver-plated ware, it is affirmed that a 
solution of hyposulphite of soda is one of the simplest and best ap- 
plications. The solution may be applied with a rag or soft brush. 
This method is free from the objection attending the use of powders, 
as there is no filling up of the fine lines or other ornamental work. 
But most housekeepers think that there is nothing better to clean 
silver with than alcohol and ammonia ; after rubbing with this take a 
little whiting or a soft cloth and polish in this way ; even frosted 
silver, which is so difficult to clean, may be easily made clear and 
bright 



MICELLANEOUS HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. , 575 

How TO Mend China. — One of the best receipts for mending china 
is the following, and it really is admirable : Take a very thick solu- 
tion of gum-arabic in water, and stir it into plaster of Paris until the 
mixture becomes a viscous paste. Apply it with a brush to the 
fractured edges, and stick them together. In three days the article 
cannot be broken in the same place. The whiteness of the cement 
renders it doubly valuable. 

To Set a Color. — One tablespoonful of ox-gall in a pint of water 
is sufficient. It is immaterial whether cotton, silk, or woollen fabric. 

To Cleanse Barrels. — Merely scrubbing out a barrel with ashes 
is not sufficient to sweeten it. The lye must penetrate the wood. 
Throw in a peck of ashes, then fill up with clean water ; let it stand a 
couple of days ; rinse and fill up with clean water a couple of times 
to soak out the lye. Jars and jugs can be sweetened by the same 
process. 

Recipe for Making Candles. — Very hard and durable c.andles 
are made in this way : Melt together ten ounces of mutton tallow, a 
quarter of an ounce of camphor, four ounces of beeswax, and two 
ounces of alum. Candles made of these piaterials burn with a strong, 
clear light. 

Ink for Zinc Labels. — Verdigris, two drachms ; ammonia, two 
drachms ; soft water, four ounces ; lampblack, one drachm. Mix in 
a mortar, adding the water by a little at a time ; keep in a glass- 
stoppered bottle. Shake before using. Write on the zinc with a 
quill pen, and when dry it is ready for use. 

To Black a Brick Hearth. — Mix some black-lead with soft soap 
and a little water and boil it ; then lay it on with a brush. Or mix 
the lead with water only. 

To Cut Glass Jars. — Fill the jar with lard-oil to where you want 
to cut the jar ; then heat an iron-rod or bar to red-heat ; immerse in 
the oil ; the unequal expansion will crack the jar all round at the 
surface of the oil, and you can lift off the top part. • 

To Clean Furniture. — One quart of cold drawn linseed-oil, half 
a pint of gin, or spirits of wine, half a pint of vinegar, two ounces of

butter of antimony, half a pint of turpentine. This mixture requires 
to be well shaken before it is used. A little of it is then to be poured 
upon a rubber, which must be well applied to the surface of the fur- 
niture. Several applications will be necessary for new furniture, or 
for such as has previously been French polished or rubbed with 
beeswax.

Kettles which come with a new stove can be cleaned by boiling

Porcelain kettles that have become brown can be rendered

Small quantities of ice may be preserved in summer by making a 
bag large enough to hold the ice ; then make another much larger

If by chance the wash-boiler should spring a leak when filled with 
clothes over a brisk fire, carefully press the clothes away from the 
side of the leak and sift a small teaspoonful of Indian meal over the 
water ; the leak will close immediately. 

Stone-jars, which have become offensive and unfit for use, may be 
rendered perfectly sweet by packing them full of earth and letting 
them stand two or three weeks. 

Good housekeepers never permit soup to cool in the iron pot in

tine, and put into a bureau or wardrobe for a single day, two or three 
times a year, is a sufficient preservation against moths. 

Keep soft soap three months before using. 

Oilcloths and straw matting can be kept bright by washing twice 
during the summer with salt and water— say about a pint of salt dis- 
solved in about a pailful of warm, soft water — drying the matting 
quickly with a soft cloth. The salt will prevent it turning yellow. 

To Preserve a Cracked Picture. — An application which is said 
to answer the purpose of preserving a scaling or cracked picture very 
well, is made of a mixture of equal parts of linseed-oil and methylated 
chloroform, which is to be poured over the painting if the colors are 
too brittle to bear the friction of a soft brush. After remaining on 
the surface of the painting for a day or two, the excess of oil may be 
removed by means of a piece of cotton wool, or a soft brush, a fresh 
portion of the preservative applied, and the excess removed as before. 
This process must be repeated from time to time until the colors are 
firmly fixed, when the painting will bear friction, and may be cleaned 
or varnished. It is recommended, however, to remove as much of 
the dirt from the picture as possible (if there be any) by careful wash- 
ing with soft water, previously to making the above application. The 
mixture will not restore the cracks in a painting, but simply fixes the 
colors, and by rendering them very elastic, prevents the cracking 
from progressing further. A mixture of one part of methylated 
chloroform and two of linseed oil is used for reviving the colors of 
paintings. After washing, a small portion is rubbed over the picture 
with cotton wool, and on the following day the painting is wiped 
over with a soft silk handkerchief Oil and chloroform, when used 
in the proportions given, possess the property — so it is claimed^of 
restoring the faded colors of paintings, and of developing colors, 
#hich, by reason of age, have perished to the eye.

oil. To remove oil spots from matting, counterpanes, etc., wet with 
alcohol, rub with hard soap, then wash with cold water. 

Ink-stains. — There are various methods for removing ink-stains 
from white fabrics, but most of them attack the material itself With 
colored goods the difficulty is increased, for that which will remove 
the ink will destroy the color. A European paper now states that 
if the stain is dipped into hot melted suet or tallow and washed when 
cold in hot water it will remove the ink together with the tat. 

The Parisian method of cleaning black silk is to brush and wipe it 
thoroughly, lay it on a flat table with the side up which is intended 
to show, and sponge with hot coffee strained through muslin. Allow 
it to become partially dry, then iron. 

To Renovate Black Cashmere. — Take about one-half teacup of 
spirits of ammonia to one quart soft water ; then with a soft sponge 
rub the pieces till thoroughly wet ; then roll tightly ; when the pieces 
are all sponged, iron immediately ; put the right side of the cashmere 
next to the flannel; use as hot an iron as possible and iron till per- 
fectly dry. Then use a soft brush to remove flannel lint from the 
right side. 

Leghorn hats are whitened (otherwise than with the fumes of sul- 
phur) as follows : Immerse in a strong aqueous solution of sulphite of 
soda or bleaching powder (chloride of lime), and then in dilute sul- 
phuric acid (acid i, water 5). The bleaching-powder treatment re- 
quires much subsequent washing, or the use of an antichlore dip, 
hyposulphite of soda dissolved in 20 parts of water. 

To remove iron-rust from linen, apply lemon-juice and salt ; expose 
to the sun. Make two applications if necessary. Then when per- 
fectly dry, I'inse in clear cold water. Lemon-juice can only be used 
on white goods, as it takes out printed colors as well as stains.
