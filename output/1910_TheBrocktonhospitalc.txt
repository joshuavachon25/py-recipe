Ys EDITOR SAYS 




I HE first part of the Brockton Hospital Cook Book, 
1906 Edition, we believe, was the best publication of 
the kind ever issued in New England. The success of 
that publication has led to the issuance of this 1910 
Edition, which is substantially entirely separate and 
distinct, so far as the recipes are concerned, from the 
first part, and we feel confident that those who pur- 
chase this book will be satisfied that nothing better in the cook book 
line was ever issued in Plymouth County. 

The members of the Ladies' Aid of the Brockton Hospital have 
put in a great deal of work in an endeavor to provide the cooks with a 
book that shall not only be of untold value to them, but shall be of 
financial value to the Brockton Hospital. Every cent received for the 
first thousand books goes directly to the treasury of the Ladies' Aid, 
and that means that every cent goes to the benefit of the Hospital 
itself. 

The Brockton Hospital is an institution established and conducted 
for the benefit of all the people of Brockton, regardless of age, race, 
sex or color, and the sale of this book is meant to help along this phil- 
anthropic object. 

There is not one cent paid to any person who asks you to buy this 
book for the benefit of the Brockton Hospital, and so we ask you to 
remember that the one who is trying to sell you this book is trying to 
help along a good cause, and that the only pay she gets is the con- 
sciousness of a good work for a good cause conscientiously performed. 
We are pleased to be able to assist in the production of so excel- 
cellent a cook book for so worthy a cause, and if anyone purchasing 
this book is not fully satisfied that she gets more than the worth of her 
money, the book can be returned, and the entire amount paid for it 
will be refunded without question. 

It is always a pleasure to help along a good cause, and the Brock- 
ton Hospital is certainly that. What little work the editor has done 
has been to help along the cause, whether it should or should not 
rebound to his personal benefit. 

Ye editor, per G. C. H.

CA SH vs. CREDIT 

EARS ago, when Brockton was a small unpretentious 
town, when all its merchants knew all of their customers 
personally, the size of their families, and their financial 
condition, and their moral characters, such a thing as a 
strictly cash store was practically unknown. At that 
time individual sales were larger, the price was higher, 
and the customer was given practically his own time in 
which to pay the bill. As Brockton has grown larger, its 
population has changed somewhat, until it is practically 
impossible for any large dealer to be well acquainted with 
all of his customers. One result of this has been the 
establishment of cash stores, where the individuality of 
the customer counts but little, where his credit is not questioned, as 
the method of doing business requii'es spot cash. 

The size of these cash stores and the amount of business which 
they do, shows conclusively that the people believe they can get more 
for the same money by paying cash than they can by receiving credit. 
There are reasons for all this, and reasons why a man who sells for 
cash can sell cheaper, or give more for the money than can the man 
who gives credit. Admitting that every customer pays his bill some- 
time, it is plain to every one that the length of time taken in which to 
pay the bill costs just so much interest money, and that interest 
money, generally, in a business the size of the This is Holmes' Coal 
Business would amount to some thousands of dollars in a year. In 
addition to this, giving credit requires additional office help, and addi- 
tional expense in keeping the accounts, so that it is only a fair propo- 
sition that the man who gets credit should pay twenty-five cents a ton 
more for coal than the man who pays spot cash, and this is based on the 
assumption (sometimes incorrect) that every one who gets trusted 
will pay his bill. 

For a great many years we have adhered very closely to the spot 
cash principle of doing the coal business, and for the purpose of expe- 
diting business, we have habitually given some little souvenir to all 
customers who pay cash at the time they order their coal. These 
souvenirs, as a general thing, cost us much less than the actual cost 
would be of opening an account with a customer. Many and useful 
things which we give, or have been giving, are lead pencils, court 
plaster, pocket mirrors, packs of needles, envelope openers and rules, 
book marks, and sometimes even coal hods and cook books. 

On all of these things will be found words of good advice as to the 
proper place to purchase coal. The plan seems to meet with general 
favor, as shown by our steadily increasing trade. Our platform is 
expressed in the words, "A Square Deal." 

We mean to deliver the best coal that money will buy at the low- 
est price at which a fair profit can be obtained, and any coal not per- 
fectly satisfactory^will be promptly takenout [and replaced by other 



coal or the money. 



THIS IS HOLMES', 58 Main St. 



The Brockton Hospital 

Is not a private institution, but belongs equally to all the people, and 
it is managed and directed by a band of public-spirited men and 
women who get absolutely nothing out of it but the satisfaction of 
having done their best to save life and relieve suffering. The more 
liberal the monied people are, the more lives can be saved and more 
suffering relieved. 

The Hospital Ladies' Aid Association is the most valuable single 
adjunct of the Hospital, and every cent that goes into the Associa- 
tion's treasury, whether from the sale of cook books or other sources, 
goes directly to the benefit of the Hospital. The sale of the 1906 
Cook Book netted the treasury over $450, and it is hoped that this, the 
1910 edition, will be still more successful. 

Too much praise cannot be given Mrs. C. C. Merritt and her de- 
voted band of fellow workers on this little book. No one; who has 
not had experience, has any idea of the vast quantity of work 
demanded for the proper production of a work of this kind, and every 
purchaser of this book is helping along the good cause. A public 
institution, privately managed, should be absolutely free of all taint 
of inefficiency, graft, incompetency and favoritism, and if anything 
appearing like that should come to your attention make it your busi- 
ness to report it, and in that way do your part to help along the good 
work that is the only aim and object of 

The Brockton Hospital 



Looking Backward 





N page four of the 1906 Cook Book appeared a fairly 
flattering picture of the man who was the cause of 
the existence of the Brockton Hospital, as well as of 
the Hospital Cook Book, and as he never means to 
turn his back on any friend, worthy object or person, 
the above picture is produced in order that you may 
see the back of his head, whether you see what is in 
or not. TT is an unusual picture, and he does unusual and often 
unpopular things in a way that seems his very own. He sells coal, 
hay, grain, poultry suplies, post cards, stationery, reading matter, 
postage stamps, etc., because he has to live, and these things bring in 
the wherewithal. Confidentially, he is an impractical sort of a chap, 
by nature a theorist and dreamer. He wants money enough to live 
in comfort, but has not the slightest desire to be what is usually 
called rich. He believes in an aristocracy of brains, not of money and 
arrogance. Funny sort of a chap, anyway, but he wants your trade 
in his several lines, and his thousands of customers say that he is a 
good man to tie to.

Two and one-half pounds flour; two ounces ground ginger; 
one-half pound brown sugar; three-fourths pound orange peel, 
cut small ; two pounds treacle or golden syrup ; 6 eggs, yolks 
and whites ; one pound butter.

RECIPE FOR COOKING A VIRGINIA OR 
KENTUCKY HAM. 

Select carefully a small Virginia or Kentucky ham. Put 
the ham in cold water and soak all night. In the morning, 
put the ham in a kettle filled with cold water. Place the 
kettle on stove and it will take an hour to boil. Then let it 
simmer five or six hours. Let the ham cool in the water it 
boils in. Then skin the ham and trim off some of the fat. 
Sprinkle with bread crumbs and a little sugar, and stick in a 
dozen or more cloves. . Brown in the oven.

A City Hall Recipe. 

COURTBOUILLON. 

Take three or four nice slices of halibut. Make a sauce by 
putting one tablespoonful of lard into the stew pan, and when 
it is hot, stir in gradually two tablespoonfuls of flour. Add 
one chopped onion, six tomatoes (chopped), one chopped 



bunch of parsley, one clove of garlic, a sprig of sweet basil 
and a sprig- of thyme, all chopped very fine. When it browns 
nicely without burning, pour in about two pints of water, and 
let it come to a boil. Rub the fish well with salt and pepper, 
and pour over it a cup of boiling vinegar. Put the fish, 
slice by slice, into the pan and let it simmer for about half an 
hour, or until the flesh begins to be soft. Then remove from 
the fire, take out of the pan, and lay the slices in a dish. Pour 
the gravy over the fish, and serve with garnishes of sliced 
lemon. — Mrs. John S. Kent.

Franklin. We never claimed

Bread. 

WHITE BREAD. 

Grate one medium size raw potato. Pour boiling water over 
it and stir until thoroughly mixed when it will become thick 
and starchy. It will be about one pint. Have one pint of milk 
scalding hot, add to the potato ; to this mixture add one large 
spoonful sugar ; salt, and one-third cup shortening. When suf- 
ficiently cool add two yeast cakes. Sift in bread flour until a 
stiff batter is formed. Cover and place where it is warm. Let 
stand until it is soft and spongy, about three hours. Stir down 
and add flour enough to handle easily. Let rise again, about 
two hours. Then mould in pans. Let stand until light. Bake 
slowly. Two loaves and pan of biscuit. This is a day bread 
mixed at nine o'clock. — Mrs. W. H. Poole.

WHITE BREAD. 
(One Loaf). 
One cup milk, scalded and cooled; one tablespoon butter 
melted in the hot milk ; one-half teaspoon salt, one level table- 
spoon sugar, one-fourth yeast cake, about four cups of flour. 
Measure the milk after scalding; add the butter, sugar and 
salt. When cool add the yeast which has been dissolved in 
one-fourth cup lukewarm water. Then stir in the flour grad- 
ually. When it is well mixed and does not adhere to sides of 
the bowl, turn onto the board lightly floured, and knead until 
small white blisters appear on the surface. Cover closely and 
set it out of a draft. In the morning it should have doubled 
in bulk ; if so, cut through and through and turn with a knife, 
cover and let rise until light. Shape into loaf, put into pan, 
cover and let rise to top of pan. Bake in a hot oven about 
forty-five minutes.

Who Burns HOLMES' 
Soft Shamokin Coal? 

0r We never sold coal that gave such universal 
^ satisfaction for the cook stove as our Special 

-U Soft Shamokin does, and a customer who 
tries it once is usually more enthusiastic over its 
merits than we dare to be. If we made as strong 
claims for it as our customers do, we might be 
charged with misrepresenting our goods in order to 
make a sale. We positively guarantee our coals 
(all of them) to be exactly as represented or money 
refunded. ^ If you get any coal of us and it does 
not seem to be the right kind to use in your par- 
ticular stove, we will willingly change it for you. 
^ We believe that "a pleased customer is the best 
advertisement," and as we also believe in adver- 
tising, we try our hardest to get "the best adver- 
tisement." ^ Ask any of the hundreds of ladies 
who use our Special Shamokin, or any of the hun- 
dreds of others who have bought other kinds of 
coal of us if they are not "pleased customers." 
^ Take no substitute. There is nothing, at the 
price, "just as good" as our Special Soft Shamo- 
kin Coal. ^ We do not advertise our other coals 
extensively, but we have them, and warrant them 
to be first-class in every respect. ^ We sell for 
cash. It costs nothing to collect our bills. The 
money saved in this way we pay out to make our 
coal clean and free from stone and slate. 

^ Don't you know this from your own 
experience?

Breakfast and Tea Cakes. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 
Two cups scalded milk, three tablespoons butter, two table- 
spoons sugar, one teaspoon salt, yeast cake dissolved in one 
and one-fourth cups lukewarm water, use almost five and one- 
half cups flour. Add butter, sugar and salt to milk; when 
lukewarm add dissolved yeast cake and three cups flour. Beat 
thoroughly, cover and let rise until light, and add enough flour 
to knead (it will take about two and one-half cups). Let 
rise again. Toss on lightly floured board, knead, pat and roll 
out to one-third inch thickness. Shape with a biscuit cutter 
first dipped in flour. Dip the handle of a case knife in flour 
and with it make a crease through the middle of each piece; 
brush over one-half of each piece with melted butter, fold and 
press edges together. Place in a greased pan, one inch apart. 
Cover, let rise and bake in a hot oven twelve to fifteen min- 
uts. — Mrs. Walter Bradford.

SALLY LUNN. 
Scald one cup milk and pour over it two tablespoonfuls each 
of butter and sugar and one-half teaspoon salt. When luke- 
warm, add one-half yeast cake dissolved in lukewarm water, 
three well beaten eggs and enough flour to make a stiflf batter ; 
let rise until very light. Pour into buttered muflin tins, let 
rise again and bake in a hot oven. — Mrs. F. E. Harrison. 

POTATO BISCUIT. 
Two cups flour, three tablespoonfuls lard, a little salt, one 
good cup mashed potato, three teaspoons baking powder. Mix 
with half milk and half water. Bake in a large pan so they 
won't touch one another. — (C.)

SALAD ROLLS. 

Dissolve three yeast cakes in one cup lukewarm water, add 
one pint milk scalded and cooled, one teaspoon salt, one table- 
spoon butter, two teaspoons sugar. Stir in enough flour to 
make a stiff dough and knead one-half hour, using as little 
flour as possible in kneading. Then without waiting for it to 
rise, divide into equal parts for small rolls and shape into balls 
and then into finger rolls, or press a small knife handle through 
the middle, making cleft rolls ; put the rolls into pan, cover 
with a cloth and let rise about forty-five minutes, then bake 
in a quick oven twenty to forty minutes according to size. Do 
not stop kneading until the time is up or let the dough stand 
before shaping. Do not disturb the dough while rising. The 
idea is to make the dough light quickly. In less than two 
hours you will have nice light rolls, with no trace of yeast. The 
crust will look hard but will be light and tender. — Mrs. C. C. 
Merritt.

HOT CROSS BUNS. 

Scald one and one-half cups milk and place in a mixing 
bowl with one-half cup sugar; when lukewarm (not hot) add 
one-half yeast cake which has been softened in two tablespoons 
warm water ; stir in flour enough to make a thick batter and 
set in a warm place to rise. When the batter is double its bulk, 
cream in two tablespoons sugar, a little nutmeg, one-half cup 
currants, a little salt, and flour enough to knead. Knead five 
minutes and let rise again. Then mould into round biscuits 
and gash a cross on the top of each. When well risen, bake 
twenty-five minutes in a hot oven. This will make twenty 
buns, and they are delicious. In the old countries the "Hot 
Cross Bun" is the favorite bread eaten on Good Friday. —

well floured board; toss with a knife until well floured; pat 
it with a rolling pin but do not roll it, and when about half an 
inch thick, cut into rounds and bake at once in a hot oven. —

POPOVERS (fine) 
Beat two eggs without separating whites and yolks, until 
light; add two cups milk, then continue beating with an egg 
beater while two cups of sifted flour sifted again with one-half 
teaspoon salt are gradually beaten into the liquid mixture. 
Butter an iron muffin pan, one with round cups preferred, 
and put a level teaspoonful of butter in each cup. Then turn 
in the batter, filling the cups two-thirds full. Bake in a hot 
oven about thirty-five minutes. This recipe makes about 
twelve large popovers. — Mary Westberg. 

POPOVERS. 
One cup flour, one-fourth teaspoon salt, seven-eighths cup 
milk, two eggs, one-half teaspoon melted butter. Mix salt 
and flour ; add milk gradually ; add egg, beaten until light, and 
butter which has been melted. Then beat two minutes, turn

CHOWDER. 
Four pounds fat pork, four quarts onions, five gallons pota-

Fry out the pork and then fry the onions until corn color. 
When I make my chowder I put on the five gallons of water; 
when it boils I add potatoes, pork and onions, also all the clam 
water that comes with the clams. When potatoes are half 
done, add the clam rims after being put through the meat 
chopper, and when two-thirds done, add the soft portion of 
the clams. When potatoes are thoroughly done, add milk and 
let it boil up twice. Stir it constantly after milk is added. I 
make mine in a farmer's boiler. When done and removed 
from the fire, add the butter. This is enough for i6o people, 
allowing one pint for each person. — Clara H. Bartlett.

POT ROAST OF BEEF. 

Four to six pounds from the middle or face of the rump, the 
vein or the round. Wipe with a clean, wet cloth. Sear all 
over by placing in a hot frying pan and turning until all the 
surface is browned. Put in a kettle with one cup of water and 
place it where it will keep just below the boiling point. Do 
not let the water boil entirely away, but add only enough to 
keep the meat from burning. Have the cover fit closely to 
keep in the steam. Cook until very tender, but do not let it 
break. Serve hot or cold. The meat when cold is delicious, 
cut in quarter inch slices and sauted in hot butter. — Mrs. W. 
H. Thome. 

POT ROAST OF BEEF. 

A square of beef cut from the round, brown it in some of its 
fat in a frying pan, on all sides. Then add two full cups of 
hot water, cover closely and set in the oven and cook slowly 
until the meat is almost ready to fall apart. There should be 
only enough water for a gravy when the meat is done. Season 
the gravy with salt and pepper, and if desired it may be thick- 
ened a little. This makes tough meat tender and palatable. 
Ham can be used the same way. — Mrs. L. F. Gtirney.

The Western Union Tele- 
graph operator who told the 
following story should take a 
position with one of the New 
York papers and talk up its 
circulation : 

"I was out hunting the other 
day and I saw a fine woodpecker 
on a tree, and just as I raised 
my gun to shoot, it rapped on 
the tree, "stop." I lowered 
my gun in astonishment, and 
the bird began to rap again ; 
and, with the precision of an 
old operator, it told me not to 
spend my time tramping 
through the woods in search of 
pleasure, but to go home and 
order some of Holmes' Special 
Soft Shamokin Coal for the 
cook stove and make my wife 
happy. I took the advice ; it 
paid both me and the bird."

AVE You EVER 

Tried Special Soft 
Shamokin Coal in 
Your Cook Stove? 



.#######%###^%j 



There is no guess work about 
this coal. Customers say it is the 
freest, brightest and best coal sold 
anywhere for the money. 

It isn't easy to judge coal — you 
must burn it and watch it carefully 
before you know it is an economical 
kind — unless you know the man 
you deal with. 

A business that has been running 
for thirty -six years ; a business so 
near to the kitchen as the coal busi- 
ness must have a reputation. 

Do you know the reputation of 
Holmes' coal yard. Did you ever 
hear of any double dealing or de- 
ceit there ? If you did, don't trade 
there If you do trade with Holmes, 
you will get good coal, prompt de- 
livery, and satisfaction or money

They were sitting in the parlor, 
Where the light was low and dim ; 

She seemed very well contented, 
And no murmur came from him. 

"George," she asked, "are you reporting 

For that horrid paper yet ? 
It is shameful how they publish 

All the scandal they can get." 

"No, my love," he jinswered softly. 

And he winked unto himself, 
"I have left." (In fact, that morning 

They had laid him on the shelf.) 

"But," he said, as he hugged her closer.

"Just at present I am working

cinnamon, a level desertspoonful of ginger; one small nut- 
meg and ten eggs, one-half pint of brandy; add just enough 
water to have a very stiff dough, one large dessertspoonful of 
salt. 

This quantity will make four very large puddings that will 
take ten hours to boil. Half, or even a quarter, will be enough 
for a small family, but do not diminish the time in boiling. 
Keep pudding covered while boiling. Use plenty of water

pudding. Serve with any rich sauce. — Mrs. A. Wesley Stet-

The ^ 

Question • 

Is not whether you are doing well 
or badly with the coal you are now 
using, but whether you are doing 
as well as you might. 

The old proverb, "a rolling 
stone gathers no moss," may be 
well off-set with "a setting hen 
never gets fat." 

Perhaps you have never tried 
our Special Soft Shamokin Coal 
for your cook stove. It is a coal 
that was, perhaps, not known when 
you went to housekeeping, but it 
is giving the greatest satisfaction 
here and now. Wouldn't it pay 
you to try some?

What 

Skilled Cooks 
Prefer. 

Ask the woman who does 
her own work, the hired girl, 
or the professional cook, why 
they are now using Shamokin 
Coal. They will tell you that 
it is because it is pure coal, that 
it is clean, that it kindles quickly, 
makes a hot fire, can always be 
depended on, and contains so 
little waste that it doesn't pay 
to sift the ashes. 

It is economical. It takes less 
coal to do the same v/ork, and 
it gives perfect results in the 
kitchen.

STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. 
Sprinkle two cups sugar over two quarts of strawberries; 
mash them and let them stand half an hour or until the sugar 
is dissolved. Turn the berries into a large square of cheese 
cloth which has been placed over a bowl. Gather up the edges 
of the cloth, twist them and squeeze as long as any juice or 
pulp will come. Then empty the pulp and seeds left in the 
cloth into a pan and pour on gradually about one pint milk; 
mix it well with the pulp, until the pulp is separated from the 
seeds. Squeeze again until perfectly dry. There should be 
nothing left in the cloth save a ball of seeds. The pulp will 
thicken the milk, and it is much nicer than the juice alone. 
Add to this pulpy juice as much cream as you may have, from 
one cup to three pints, and sugar to make it very sweet. This 
cream should be scalded and cooled. Freeze as usual. This 
is a great improvement over that made by simply mashing the 
fruit, where the presence of the seeds is objectionable. — Mrs. 
F. A. Besse.

Do You Buy 
Coal of Holmes? 

If you don't, read what we 
have to say: 

^ Coal is worth more clean than dirty, 
for there is less for the ash heap. 
^ Coal handled by underpaiid, over- 
worked men will be full of dirt, stone 
and slate. 

^ Good men, well treated and well 
paid, will deliver clean coal in a satis- 
factory manner. 

^ Regular Shamokin Coal is very 
liable to be slaty, and needs careful 
picking before delivery. Our Special 
Soft Shamokin is all hand picked. 
^ Our men work for our interest (and 
yours) and are careful to pick out the 
slate and refuse matter. 
^ If you buy coal of us and are not 
suited, let us know, and we will ex- 
change it for other coal or money. 
We want your trade and will try to 
please you, for we believe in adver- 
tising, and "a pleased customer is the 
best advertisement."

Confectionery. 

"All that's sweet was made but to be lost 
when sweetest." — Moore. 

The whole "trick" of candy making depends upon the boil- 
ing of the syrup. The directions here given are absolutely re- 
liable, but you may fail of results the first time in following 
them. Select only clear days for candy making, dampness be- 
ing fatal to the best results.

FONDANT. 
Into a porcelain-lined saucepan put one pound granulated 
sugar, one cup water and one-third teaspoon cream of tartar; 
stir until sugar is dissolved, then touch not, only to carefully 
wipe off the crystals as they form on the sides of the pan, or to 
very gently remove any scum that may collect. At the end of 
ten minutes begin testing by dipping a spoon into a bowl of 
ice water, then gently taking out a little syrup and returning 
to the water. As soon as you can form a soft ball it is done. 
Remove from fire and turn on to a buttered platter to cool. 
As soon as you can bear your finger in it, with comfort, begin 
to stir with a wooden cake beater, until a milk white creamy 
mass is formed too thick to stir. Now knead until it is pliable 
and smooth, when it can be put into a bowl and covered with 
a damp cloth for future use. As you use it, work in any flavor 
you like. — Mrs. Proctor, N ewtonville ; Mrs. A. W. Knight.

it gets cold. It will be as smooth as any butter and tastes un-

Chopper." — Mary Packard.

Treatment for £mergencies. 

BURNS. 

Treatment: If your own clothes catch fire lie down on the 
floor and roll, keeping your mouth shut. If you see another 
person in danger, throw her down (it is usually a woman), 
wrapping her in shawl, rug, or any woolen thing at hand, to 
stifle the flames, keeping the fire from the face. The great 
danger is that of inhaling the flames. 

In the treatment of burns or scalds the first object is to 
exclude the air. A simple method of doing this is to apply 
a wet cloth, and sprinkle freely with common baking soda. 
If burns are severe, send for a doctor at once. Burns by 
strong acids are treated the same, further action of the acid 
being prevented by bathing with alkaline solution, as of soda, 
ammonia, or common earth. 

The Best in Brockton View Postcards at Holmes', 58 Main St. 

CONVULSIONS. 
Place patient on back with head slightly raised. Loosen 
any tight clothing and allow free supply of air. See that he 
does not hurt himself. Place something (a piece of wood, 
lead pencil or handkerchief) between teeth, keeping him from 
biting his tongue. If a child, place in a warm bath with cold 
applications to head. 

ERUPTION FROM POISON IVY, OAK, ETC 
Sooth by applications of Listerine or solution of common 
baking soda. 

The Best in Brocl<ton View Postcards at Holmes', 58 IVIain St. 

FAINTING. 
Fainting is caused by insufficient supply of blood to the 
brain. Treatment : Place patient flat on back, head lower than 
feet. Loosen clothing around throat and upper part of body, 
allowing free access of air. Sprinkle water on face or apply 
smelling salts to stimulate breathing.

presence excites. A blow on the back between the shoulders, 
will be of use if a person is choking. A child may be held up 
by the feet, head down, while a succession of blows are ad- 
ministered between the shoulders. This will seldom fail to dis- 
lodge the foreign body unless it has been sucked below the air 
passages.

HEMORRHAGE FROM NOSE. 
If bleeding is severe, a doctor should be sent for at once. 
In the meantime, open windows and undo tight clothing from 
neck. Do not allow patient to hang head over basin, but place 
patient on chair or couch in position of repose. Raise arms, 
stretching to full extent above and rather behind head. Apply 
cold wet sponge or towel, or lump of ice, to back of neck, and 
also another sponge, towel or piece of ice over forehead at root 
of nose. If this does not stop bleeding and the doctor has not 
arrived, take a piece of handkerchief or soft cloth and, wrap- 
ping it up tightly, push it into the bleeding nostril. 

HEMORRHAGE OR RUPTURE OF VARICOSE 
VEINS. 
Pressure should be made below the bleeding point; cold or 
heat applied and limb elevated.

POISONS. 
Treatment: On all occasions send for a doctor at once. An 
emetic always on hand is a teaspoonful of salt or mustard in 
a cup of warm water, repeated every fifteen minutes until vom- 
iting occurs. Do not give an emetic when there are stains on 
the lips. These are caused by acids whose action is so rapid 
that the tissues would be injured long before an emetic could 
be given. Give instead, castor or salad oil, 

227 



In carbolic acid poisoning give one or two tablespoonfuls 
of epsom salts or plenty of milk or milk and lime water. 
Keep quiet. 

In corrosive poisoning give white of egg or plenty of milk, 
followed by an emetic. 

SPRAINS. 

Soak injured part in water as hot as can be borne for one- 
half hour ; then apply moist bandage, keeping the part elevated 
and at rest. 

We Please Particular People. This Is Holmes', 58 Main St. 

FOR SIMPLE CUTS OR BRUISES. 

Cleanse parts with soap and water, and irrigate with clean, 
warm water, or it may be soaked in creolin solution made by 
adding one teaspoon of creolin to one quart of water. Wrap 
in clean linen or cotton cloth. If inflammation follows go to 
the doctor at once.

Suggestions for the Sick and 
Convalescent. 

LIQUID DIET. 

Liquid diet consists entirely of liquids, viz: — milk, malted 
milk, meat broths, beef tea, beef juice, oyster broth, clam 
water, albumen water, albuminized milk, orange albumen, bar- 
ley water, rice water, eggnog, tea and coffee. Of these, milk 
is the most valuable. 

The taste of milk may be altered by heating, or by the addi- 
tion of salt, pepper, ginger ale, coffee, chocolate or seltzer. 

For making cold beverages the water should be freshly 
drawn ; for hot, freshly boiled. 

Fruit beverages should be served ice cold. Syrup is a bet- 
ter sweetener than sugar. It is made of sugar one cup, water 
one cup. Mix and stir until dissolved. Boil twelve minutes. 
Bottle and cool. 

The change from liquids to light diet should be made grad- 
ually. Wine or fruit jellies are palatable and nutritious. After 
jellies, a bit of water or milk toast, then an egg, a little soup 
or pudding until the person is able to take anything in the list. 

All the New Novels, 2 Cents a Day, at Holmes' Library, at 58 Main St 

LIGHT DIET. 

Light diet consists of all the liquid diets, and in addition 
fruits, as grapes, oranges or grape fruit; porridge of farina, 
wheat germ or white com meal ; soft-boiled or poached eggs ; 
dry, water, milk or cream toast; soups as celery, mock bisque 
and chicken; light puddings, custards, jellies, ices and creams. 
For dinner a meat ball or a small bit of beef steak or chop and 
baked potato.

231 



CONVALESCENT DIET. 

Convalescent diet includes the liquid and light diet, and in 
addition all easily digested and nutritious food. Game, veni- 
son, beef, mutton and chicken ; eggs in all ways, as soft cooked, 
scrambled, etc. ; well baked or creamed potatoes, celery, gra- 
ham bread, gems, and all well made bread, and good cake. 

Some foods to avoid are: Pastry, badly made cake, pork, 
veal, any highly seasoned meat dishes made with gravy ; all 
kinds of fried foods and heavy puddings. 

Liquid Diet. 

BEEF JUICE 

Place half a pound of lean, juicy beef on a broiler over a 
clear, hot fire and heat it through. Press out the juice with 
a lemon sqeezer into a hot cup, add salt, and serve with toast 
or crackers. 

In making beef tea or beef juice the best cuts are the top 
of the round, the back and middle of the rump, as they contain 
the most and best flavored juice.

BEEF TEA. 
Take a pound of round steak, remove all the fat and cut 
into small pieces. Put into a jar and fill with cold water. 
Cover closely and let it stand in a warm place for an hour.

OLMES' Recipe for 
Good Business. 



After more than a third of a century in the 
retail coal business in Brockton, we feel qualified 
to offer a good recipe for conducting a more or 
less successful business ; but in trying this recipe 
you must use judgment as you would in the others 
in this book. 

Take a liberal quantity of honesty, industry, 
courage, chstfacter, experience, and determination; 
mix them thoroughly, and add such money as 
you happen to have. It is not advisable to de- 
pend too much upon the money, but the others 
are essential. Get a good location, and let your 
prospective customers know all about it. Be 
honest in all your dealings — don't try to be sharp 
— it may take longer to arrive, but it is sure to pay 
eventually. Make your word as good as your 
bond. if you make a mistake, acknowledge it 
like a man, and people will have confidence in 
you when you correct it. Put enough profit in 
your sales to give you an honest living ; treat all 
people alike, and as you would like to be treated 
were the conditions reversed. Don't put in any 
lying, under any circumstances — it won't pay in 
the end. Treat those who work for you like 
human beings, and pay them such wages as you 
would need if conditions were reversed ; then 
they will work for your interest, and make friends 
for you. If you don't have success in following 
this recipe, it is not the fault of 
Yours truly, 





This is one of the few recipes that is practi- 
cally duplicated from the 1906 edition, but we 
believe it cannot be improved upon.
