Shredded ^VTieat Dishes 

A dainty, wholesome, appetizing meal can be prepared with 
Shredded Wheat Biscuit "in a jiffy." It is ready-cooked and ready 
to serve. You can do things with it that are not possible with any 
other "breakfast food." It is the only cereal food made in buscuit 
form. Combined with fresh or preserved fruit, or with creamed 
meats or creamed vegetables, or simply eaten as breakfast 'food 
with milk or cream, it .is delicious, nourishing and satisfying. 

Shreeded Wheat is made of the whole wheat, cleaned, cooked, 
drawn into fine porus sherds and twice baked. It is the cleanest, 
purest cereal food made in the world. Recipes for making many 
wholesome "Shredder Wheat Dishes" will be found in this book. 

SHREDDED WHEAT is made in two forms: BISCUIT, for 
breakfast or any meal; TRISCUIT the Shredded Wheat wafer, 
eaten as a toast for luncheon or any other meal with butter 
cheese or marmalades. Both the Biscuit and Triscuit should 
be heated in the oven to restore crispness before serving. .Our 
new Cook Book is sent free for the asking.

WILLIAMS, ARIZONA. 



Williams is a thriving mountain city with a population of 
about 2,500, delightfully located in the heart of the great 
pine belt of Coconimo County, in Northern Arizona, at an alti- 
tude of 6,570 feet above sea-level. It is the terminal of the 
Grand Canyon Railway, and a commercial point on the A. T. & 
S. F. Railway. In addition to the revenue from these sources, 
there is situated in this city the largest saw-mill and box factory 
in the Southwest, which gives employment to many men. There 
are also stock ranges, copper mines and thriving ranches sur- 
rounding it. 

Williams is about sixty miles distant from, and is aptly named 
the Gateway to the Grand Canyon of Arizona, being the only 
point from which to visit this world's greatest natural wonder, 
by rail. Five miles south of the city is situated Bill Williams 
Mountain, named for that famous hunder and scout, whose 
name it bears, and whose remains lie entombed on its summit. 
The mountain is easily accessible, as the beautiful winding trail 
begins right at the edge of the city. Nearly one-fourth of Ari- 
zona is visible from the highest peak, which has an aitltude of 
ten thousand feet. 

Williams' summer climate is acknowledged to be the coolest 
and most delightful on the continent, the temperature averag- 
ing 75 degrees, the days being sunny and pleasant, and the 
nights always cool and conducive to sleep. 

Williams has one of the most modern school buildings in the 
Territory, and an efficient corps of teachers. Also a Roman 
Catholic, and a Methodist Church. 

Williams enjoys most of the modern conveniences, electric 
lights, water works, and a sewer system. The telephone ser- 
vice is also of the best. 

Williams has the latest of Fred Harvey's hotels, the Fra 
Marcos, recently constructed at an expenditure of $125,000.00, 
and its accommodations cannot be surpassed. 

Williams needs a public library. 



'We may live without poetry, music and art; 
We may live without conscience and live without heart; 
We may live without friends; we may live without books; 
But civilized man cannot live without cooks. 

He may live without books what is knowledge but grieving? 
He may live without hope, what is hope but deceiving? 
He may live without love, what is passion but pining? 
But where is the man that can live without dining?" 

Lucile. 



DIET. 



In a book of this character it wouldn't be amiss to say a few 
words on the effect of cooking on meats and vegetables. Will 
quote from the work of Frieclenwald and Ruhrah on Diet : 

"The effect of cooking on meat is to diminish its watery con- 
stituents, thus concentrating and rendering it more nutritious ; 
by this process also the extractives, as \vell as some of the fats, 
are partly removed. 

The chief loss in weight during boiling, sauteing, and pen 
broiling is due to water removed by the heat of the cooking. 
In the roasting of meats the chief loss is due to the removal of 
both water and fat. In pan broiling the losses which take 
place are very small as compared with the other methods of 
cooking. The longer time meat is cooked, and the higher tem- 
perature at which this is done, 'the greater the loss in water and 
fat, the larger pieces losing relatively less than the smaller ones. 

The important object in the cooking of vegetables is to rup- 
ture the cellulose envelop and so to soften the contained starch- 
granules. Under the influence of heat and moisture the starch 
swells and bursts its envelop, forming a paste ; this paste, in its 
turn, expands and ruptures the cellulose envelope; cooking, 
therefore, renders vegetable foods more easily digestible. 

In the cooking of meats a certain portion of the ingredients 
are lost. Unlike meats, however, vegetables become more 
watery in cooking. In this condition they are more easily acted 
upon by the gastric secretion; on the other hand, the addition 
of water in cooking so increases their buk that the motor func- 
tion of the stomach is apt to be overworked." 

DR. C. D. JEFFRIES. 



INTRODUCTORY. 



Many cooks find from experience that few recipes can be fol- 
lowed exactly and under all conditions and in all climates. 

In Northern Arizona the altitude, which 6700 feet, and the 
extreme dryness of the atmosphere affect certain articles in 
common use. For instance, salt loses its flavor when left stand- 
ing, and requires a larger quantity. This is due perhaps to the 
evaporative atmosphere. Less baking powder and shortening, 
but more flour is necessary. Cake and bread require longer 
baking and articles cooked by boiling take a much longer time 
because the boiling point is lower. Soft boiled eggs need four 
minutes, while in lower altitudes three minutes will suffice. 

This book, however, is not a high altitude cook book. We 
have endeavored to compile a book that could be utilized either 
in high or low altitudes, but of course, one must be governed to 
some extent by the locations from where the different recipes 
have been submitted. 

We have omitted flavoring of brandy or wine -in the few in- 
stances in which they were given. Otherwise the recipes stand 
just as they were received and we hope they will prove a pleasure 
and help to everyone. 

The proceeds from the sale of this book will be used in con- 
structing and maintaining a public library for our town.

BREAD 



"Now therefore I pray thee, harken thou also unto the voice of 
thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, 
that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way." Bible. 

THE BREAD I BAKE. 

(By Kennett Harris.) 

You tell me that you hold me dear, 

You say that for my love you sigh; 
You're only happy when I'm near. 

Without me you would want to die. 
That's very nice, I won't deny, 

Your heart I do not want to break, 
But will you joke about my pie 

And will you scorn the bread I bake? 

I've heard of husbands who would sneer 

And scold when matters went awry. 
Who keep their wives in dread and fear, 

Who carp and grumble and decry. 
Of course, you know, I don't imply 

That such a course you're apt to take, 
But how about the chops I fry, 

And will you scorn the bread I bake? 

Perchance within one fleeting year 

You might not rate my charms so high, 
You might say that my roast was queer 

And call it tasteless, burnt and dry, 
For me all dangers you'd defy, 

You'd brave the gallows or the stake, 
But will you call my coffee lye, 

And will you scorn the bread I bake? 

L'ENVOI. 

There's this about the marriage tie: 

You'd suffer all for my sweet sake, 
But how about the hats I buy? 

And will you scorn the bread I bake? 

YEAST. 

Soak one cake yeast foam in a little warm water over night. 
In morning grate two large or three medium potatoes, add one- 
third cup sugar, heaping tablespoon salt and three pints boiling 
water. \Yhen cool, add yeast, cover well, let rise in a warm 
place ; after it rises, put in cool place. Mrs. C. Wisehart, Flag-

CAKES 



"Only Tyndall can explain 
The links between the cake and brain; 
Get your husband what he likes 
And save a hundred household strikes! 
Give him all he wants to eat, 
Make his disposition sweet." 

TO BAKE CAKE. 

How hot should the oven be for cake, and how can one tell 
when a cake is ready to be taken out ? asks Mrs. E. D. There 
is probably no other place in cooking where so much depends on 
the baking as in making cake. The fire must be sufficient to last 
through the entire baking, and yet it should not be as hot as for 
baking bread. If the oven seems too hot, leave the door open 
for a few minutes before putting in the cake. Then carefully 
watch it, and if necessary, put the asbestos baking sheets below 
and above to protect it from too great heat. Thin cakes require 
a hotter oven than those baked in loaves, and if the oven be not 
hot enough at first, or be cooled constantly during the baking, 
the cake is apt to be heavy. 

Thin cakes should bake from fifteen to twenty minutes; 
thicker ones from thirty to forty, and whichever kind you are 
baking, divide the required time into quarters. During the first 
quarter the cake should continue to rise, during the second it 
should begin to brown a little, during the third it should brown 
evently, and in the last, shrink from the pan. If the cake browns 
before rising the oven is too hot. If the cake rises in the center 
and cracks open it is too stiff with flour. In telling whether it is 
done or not, press it with your finger lightly. If it comes back it 
is apt to be done ; if the depression stays in, the cake is not en- 
tirely done ; or take it from the oven and listen to it : a pro- 
nounced ticking or wet sound means that the cake is not yet 
baked. Good Housekeeping. 

ALTITUDE CAKE. 

One cup granulated sugar, one-half cup butter, one cup milk, 
two cups flour, two teaspoons baking powder, one, two or three 
eggs, saving whites of one or two for frosting. One whole egg 
will make a good cake. Two yolks and white of one a better 
cake. Yolks of three and whites of one or two the best cake. 
Cream butter and sugar, add egg yolks and cream more, add 
baking powder to flour and alternately mix milk and flour with 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 45 

creamed mixture. Beat thoroughly, adding last, the well beaten 
whites. As a layer cake, any sort of filling may be used. An 
excellent marble cake may be made by coloring half the batter 
with melted chocolate and dropping alternate spoonfuls of white 
and brown batter in loaf pan. Cover top with chocolate icing 
and nut meats or cocoanut sprinkled on. Spices and raisins may 
be added and an excellent cake is made by adding one cup Eng- 
lish currants. Mrs. C. F. Philbrook, Bisbee, Ariz. 

HIGH ALTITUDE CAKE. 

One and one-half cups flour, one cup sugar, two level tea- 
spoons baking powder, one-fourth teaspoonful salt. Put all 
together in sifter and sift, then add two tablespoonfuls melted 
butter ; break in cup two eggs and fill up with water, add to the 
rest and beat well. Bake either in layers or loaf. 

Note. When melted butter is used, the butter should be 
melted before measuring.- Mrs. Finney, Williams, Ariz. 

ANGEL CAKE. 

Beat stiff the cold whites of twelve eggs with a pinch of salt, 
fold in not beat one and one-half tumblers granulated sugar 
gradually, one teaspoon vanilla slowly, then one tumbler flour 
which has been sifted five times with one scant teaspoon cream 
tartar. Put in- a tube pan not greased, and bake about forty 
minutes, in a moderate oven without opening the door. When 
taken from the oven, turn upside down to cool. After it drops 
from pan, frost with any plain icing. Have house and kitchen 
very quiet when baking, avoiding any draft, or the cake will 
fall. Contributed, Williams, Ariz. 

ANGEL CAKE. 

Whites of nine eggs, one and one-fourth cupfuls granulated 
sugar, one cupful flour, one-half teaspoon cream of tartar, add 
pinch of salt to the eggs before whipping; flavor to taste. Sift, 
measure and set aside the sugar and flour. Whip the eggs to a 
foam, add the cream of tartar and whip until very stiff ; add the 
sugar to this and fold in, always using a spoon; then flavor and 
fold in, then flour and fold it lightly through. Put in a moder- 
ate oven at once. It will bake in about twenty-five or thirty 
minutes; it should not take longer, as baking too long 
dries it out and makes the cake tough and dry. Always put in 
a moderate oven too hot for butter cakes, and not hot enough 
for biscuits. If the cake is properly mixed it will rise above the 
pan. When it is baked enough it begins to shrink, and should 



46 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

shrink back to the level of the pan. Watch carefully at this 
stage, and when it begins to shrink, take out of the oven and in- 
vert the tin immediately, resting on the center tube; let hang 
until perfectly cold, then cut the cake loose from around the 
sides and the center tube. Knock back the slide, insert your 
knife and cut loose from the bottom; turn out. Ice with plain 
white frosting. Mrs. M. S. Carpenter, Trout Creek, Mich. 

ANGEL CAKE. 

Whites of nine large eggs, or ten small ones, one and one- 
fourth cups granulated sugar,, one cup flour, scant one-half 
teaspoon cream of tartar, a pinch of salt added to the eggs 
before whipping. Flavor to taste. Sift four times, measure 
and set aside sugar and flour, whip eggs to foam, add cream 
tartar, and whip until very stiff, add sugar and beat in (always 
using a spoon to mix cakes with), then add flour and fold it 
lightly through. Put in moderate oven, will bake in twenty to 
forty minutes. I always have best of results with this recipe, 
but" am particular about directions. Frost as any cake. Turn 
cake upside down when done. Mrs. J. M. Dennis, San Jose, 
Calif.

No spoon to be used. Butter and sugar creamed with the 
hands, and eggs added one at a time, into the creamed butter

sifted three times before used, and to be weighed after last sift- 
ing. Add one heaping teaspoonful baking powder to the flour, 
then flour to be added gradually to the creamed butter, sugar 
and eggs. To preserve or keep this cake moist for some length 
of time, one wine glass of wine can be added. When adding 
the wine, add a little more flour. A large pound tin or two 
small half pound tins should be used. If baked in large size 
tins, must stay in oven one hour. Fire to be slow and steady.

A GOOD SPONGE CAKE. 

Separate the whites and yolks of four eggs. When the whites 
are stiff enough to remain in the bowl when it is inverted, beat 
into them one-half cup sugar which must be granulated. Pow- 
dered sugar makes tough cake. Then beat the yolks, add to 
them another half cup of sugar, beating for five minutes by the 
clock ; this latter .is very important as the delicate texture of the 
cake depends upon it. Add to the yolks the juice and grated 
rind of one lemon. Now beat well together the yolks and 
whites. At this stage, beating is in order, but must be abso- 
lutely avoided after adding the flour, of which take one cup ; this 
is to be tossed or stirred into it with a ligt turn of the wooden 
spoon. The cup of sugar should be generous, the flour scanty. 
Bake for twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven. Just before 
putting in the oven sprinkle on top through a sifter about a 
tablespoonfnl of granulated sugar. -Miss Katherine Anderson,

tablespoonful of butter, one-fourth teaspoonful of mustard, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt. It is well to use for this dish any dry 
or stale pieces of cheese, and cayenne pepper is a little better 
than the ordinary pepper. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and 
set the bowl in a dish of hot water on the fire. Beat the mixture 
until it becomes smooth; then put in jars and seal them care- 
fully. The cheese may be used as soon as it is made, but it will 
keep for some time.

butter, four eggs. Put the water and butter in a sauce pan 
over the fire, and when it boils add all the flour at once and 
stir quickly over the fire until it forms a ball which leaves 
the pan. Set aside until partly cool then add one egg at a 
time until all are used. Then heat vigorously for about five 
minutes. Drop teaspoonfuls on a buttered tin about two 
inches apart. Bake in a rather quick oven twenty-five or 
thirty minutes. In the baking lies the success. If removed 
before done they will fall. Excellent. Mrs. P. A. Melick.

one thoroughly, then add the baking powder and drop in 
spoonfuls on baking tins some distance apart. Bake slowly 
about forty-five minutes, or until the cakes feel very light. 
When cold remove soft inside portion and will with a cream 
made as follows: One quart milk, three eggs, sugar to taste, 
and thicken with cornstarch. Boil to the consistency of a thin 
custard, and when cold add lemon or vanilla flavoring. Miss 
Dorothy Stark, Williams, Ariz. 

PINEAPPLE SPONGE. 

Let one can grated pineapple and one cupful granulated 
sugar stand an hour. Then add white of one egg well beaten, 
one-half box gelatine dissolved in cup boiling water. Beat all to- 
gether very hard. Put in a mold for at least half a day, or 
over night on ice would prove much more satisfactory. 
Serve on a pudding plate surrounded with little bunches of 
whipped cream with a strawberry on red cherry on each. 
Many prefer to mold and serve this individually. Mrs. Der- 
mont, Williams, Ariz.

DIET 



The percentage of individuals who give thought to their 
physical and mental requirements in diet, is small indeed. 

Although the human system can be sustained through long 
periods of physical, and mental labor, upon a few articles 
of food ; in order to thoroughly satisfy the needs "of the body, 
the diet must be varied. 

Occupation should govern to a great extent, the kind and 
quantity of food taken, as well as the time of consumption. 

Diet should vary somewhat with climatic, or season 
changes. 

Individuals of sedentary occupation should confine their 
diet largely to the vegetable kingdom, namely: Cereals, 
Legumes. Roots and Tubers, Green Vegetables. Fruits, Nuts, 
Fungi and Litchens. Under the different heads we have 
the following: 

Cereals : Barley, buckwheat, corn, rye, oats, rice and 
wheat. 

Legumes : Peas, beans, peanuts. 

Rools and Tubers : Irish Potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, 
artichokes, beets, carrots, parsnips, turnips and radishes. 

Green Vegetables : Cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, lettuce, 
sorrel, celery, tomatoes, egg plant, cucumbers, asparagus, 
rhubarb, pumpkins, squash, onions and garlic. 

Fruits and Nuts : A great variety. 

Fungi and Litchens : Mushrooms, truffle, morel, Iceland 
moss. 

Animal food should also be included in the daily diet, 
sparingly during the warm summer months, and increased 
slightly during the cold winter months. 

Physical laborers require a liberal diet of animal food, and 
should also partake freely of vegetable products. 

All food taken should be thoroughly masticated to insure 
saturation with saliva, as otherwise, perfect digestion is an 
impossibility. 

Animal food digests more rapidly than vegetable food, and 
where necessary may be taken at intervals of two or three 
hours, in small quantity. 



142 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

Vegetable food requires five or six hours for thorough di- 
gestion, and should not be taken at shorter intervals. 

The temperature of food is of considerable important 
The ideal temperature is that of the body 98 degrees Fahren- 
heit, the limits of safety being 45 degrees and 130 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 

A short period of rest after meals is conducive to good 
digestion.

DOUGHNUTS 



DOUGHNUTS OR FRIED CAKES. 

As much care must be taken in the mixing as in the cooking. 
In Xorthern Arizona do not use too much shortening in the 
dough, and mix very soft, rolling without kneading. Try the 
boiling fat, in which they are to be cooked, with a small piece 
of dough. If a piece of raw potato is put into the boiling fat 
it will prevent browning too much and will help clarify it. 
Two tablespoonfuls vinegar added to the lard will prevent the 
cakes absorbing too much grease. Some cooks add one-half 
teaspoonful ground ginger in the dough, saying that, too, will 
prevent the dough absorbing too much fat.

EGGS 



"Lays of ancient Rome." 
McCaulay. 

It was then that I saw the cook book, and while Mr. Har- 
bison had his back turned I got it down. It was quite clear 
that the domestic type of woman was his ideal, so I took the 
book into the pantry and read the recipe over three times. 
When I came back I knew it by heart though I did not un- 
derstand it. "I will tell you how," I said, with a great deal 
of dignity, "and since you want to help you can make it 
yourself." 

He was delighted. 

"Fine !" he said. "Suppose you give me the idea first. Then 
we'll go over it slowly, bit by bit. We'll make a big fluffy 
omelet and if the others aren't around we'll eat it ourselves." 

"Well," I said, trying to remember, "you take two eggs ." 
"Two!" he repeated. "Two eggs for ten people!" "Don't 
interrupt me," I said irritably. "If if two isn't enough we 
can make several omelets, one after the other." 

He looked at at me with admiration. "Well, what next?" 

"Separate them," I said easily. No, I didn't know what 
it meant, but I hoped he would. Iknew he was staring at 
me puzzled. 

"Separate them !" he said. "Why they aren't fastened to- 
gether!" Then he laughed. "Oh, yes, of course!" When 
I looked at him he had put one on each end of the table 
"Afraid they'll quarrel, I suppose," he said. "Wei, noM 
they're separated." 

"Then beat." 

"First separate, then beat!" he repeated. "-The author of 
that cook book must have had a mean disposition. What 
next? Hang them?" He looked up at me with his boyish 
smile. 

"Separate and beat," I repeated. If I lost a word of that 
recipe I was gone. "Well," he reflected, "you can't beat an 
egg, no matter how cruel you may be, unless you break it 
first." He picked up an egg and looked at it. "Separate:" 
he reflected. "Ah, the white from the whatever you cook- 
ing experts call it the yellow part." "Of course. I knew 
you would find out." Then back to the recipe "beat until 
well mixed; then fold in the whites." 



WILUAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 157 

"Fold:" he questioned. "It looks pretty thin to fold, doesn't 
it? Please come and show me how." 

"Just fold them in," I said desperately. "It it isn't diffi- 
cult." And because I was so transparent a fraud, I said 
something about butter and went into the pantry. I leaned 
my elbows despondently on the shelf of the kitchen pantry 
and waited for Mr. Harbison to come in and demand that I 
fold a raw egg. 

He came. "I have solved it," he said. "The mixture 
awaits the magic touch of the cook." 

I honestly thought I could do the rest. It was only to be 
put in a pan and browned in the oven three minutes. And 
I did it properly, but for two things; I should have greased 
the pan, (but this was the book's fault; it didn't say) and I 
should have lighted the oven. The latter, however, was Mr. 
Harbison's fault as much as mine, and I "had wit enough to 
lay it to absent mindedness on the part of us both.

add the eggs, let all get very hot. Serve with chopped pickle 
garnish with parsley. Mrs. M. S. Carpenter, Hacken- 
sack, N. J. 

DAINTY EGGS. 

A dainty way to serve eggs for breakfast, luncheon or 
tea, is to take round slices of bread, toast them delicately, 
butter them and dip lightly in hot water. On each round 
spread the white of an egg beaten stiff with a speck of salt. 
Make a depression in the center in which place a whole yolk, 
set it in the oven just long enough to set the yolk and brown 
the white a trifle. Place on a platter and garnish with pars-

FISH 



"The silvery fish, 

Grazing at large in meadows submarine, 
Fresh from the ware now cheers 
Our festive board." Anon. 

FISH. 

Fish should be dressed as soon as caught. Salt fish must 
be soaked eight or ten hours, with the skin side up and the 
water changed two or three times. Fish must not stand after 
being cooked, but served at once. The usual modes of cook- 
ing fish are broiled, baked, boiled, fried and occasionally 
stewed, though steaming is much superior to boiling. Very 
large fish are cut into slices or steaks, for frying or broiling. 
Bake fish slowly, basting often with butter and water. 
When boiling fish, by adding a little vinegar and salt 
to the w r ater it seasons and prevents the goodness from being 
drawn out. Fish to be boiled should be put in boiling water 
and cook gently or it will break and look badly. Many put 
fish into a cloth or bag to boil. In frying fish the fire must 
be hot enough to sear the outside keeping the juices in. As 
soon as each side of the fish is browned the frying pan can 
be moved back on the range. In no way is fish more delicious 
or digestible than when baked, and in no way can it be more 
easily prepared. With the addition of a dressing or a vegeta- 
ble a very substantial dinner may be prepared with a minimum 
of attention, which solves a difficult problem when the house- 
wife finds her time unusually taken up during the hour be- 
fore dinner. Any of the larger fish in which the bones are 
coarse are suitable for baking, such as pickerel, cod, halibut 
and white fish. 

FISH BALLS. 

Shred two cups cold boiled fish, add one-half cup sweet 
milk, one cup seasoned mashed potatoes, one well beaten egg. 
Season to taste add grated onion or a a little Worcestershire 
sauce. Mix well, make into balls and fry in deep hot fat. 
Mrs. W. F. Dermont, Williams, Ariz. 

FISH CAKES.

tatoes, mix well, adding salt, well beaten egg. Mold in the

DRESSING FOR FISH'.

salt pork through the food chopper, and beat two eggs very 
light. Mix these ingredients together, add salt and pepper 
and sufficient bread crumbs to thicken. Seasoning may vary to 
suit the occasion and the taste. Sliced onion is good, or a 
few oysters chopped coarse, or parsley, summer savory or 
tomato catsup may be used. Fill the fish with this mixture, 
before tying, and make the remainder of the dressing into 
small, flat balls, and bake in the same dish. Serve on a deep 
platter with the dressing as a garnish. Thicken the gravy 
that remains in the baking dish with a little browned flour and 
serve in a separate dish. Contributed, Williams, Ariz.

cold and do not bring them into the kitchen until you get ready 
to fry them and not allowed to get warm anjl limber. Put in 
plenty of pepper and salt and roll in flour. 

Take your heaviest frying pan, and put in a few slices of 
pork, never use bacon. When the grease is hot put the fish in 
and never cover them, do not let them burn on the bottom, 
and turn njlhout breaking them. Let them cook quite 
awhile so they will be well done and quite crisp, and remove 
without grease. Sometimes it is better to lay them on a piece 
of brown paper for an instant to take away the grease. 
Serve on hot plates. Be cooking the second frying panful 
when the first goes on the table. Do not garnish the platter.

DIET FOR TYPHOID CONVALESCENTS. 

The first week after temperature subsides the patient may be 
given corn meal gruel, arrowroot, with milk', sago and rice. 

Second week the patient may have oysters, claims, raw eggs 
with milk, milk toast and toasted crackers. 

The patient should wait until ten days after temperature sub- 
sides before taking solid food, beginning with scraped beefsteak, 
poached eggs on toast and gradually increasing until normal 
diet is established. 

The first week a convalescent patient should have plenty of 
fresh air and sunshine, soda baths daily and alcohol rubs, and 
may be permitted to sit up a little the latter part of the first week. 

The second week a convalescent patient may be taken out in 
the open air and permitted to remain two or three hours at a 
time in a reclining position. 

Should abnormal temperature return if the patient has been 
given solid food such food should be discontinued. N. H. 
Morrison, Chief Surgeon, A. T. & S. F. R. R., Los Angeles, 
Calif. 



DISHES INVALIDS WILL ENJOY 



APPLES IN GRAPE JUICE. 

Apples, grape juice, cream. You cannot have this in perfec- 
tion unless you start with some sound apples. Pare them care- 
fully. Have a little sweetened, unfennented grape juice boil- 
ing, and cook the pared apples in the juice until they have be- 
come tender. Then lift them carefully and place them on the 
serving-dis.h. Boil down the juice until it has become quite 
thick, and pour it over the apples. Serve .cold with or without 
cream. If preferred, soft custard may be substituted for 
cream. 

BARI/EYADE AND JELL/Y. 

One-half pint of Pearl barley, three pints of water, one table- 
spoon of orange juice, seasoning. . Carefully pick over the bar- 
ley and then wash it. Cover with three pints of water and cook 
slowly for two hours ; then pour off a teacupful, strain it and 
sweeten to taste. Add a pinch of salt and the orange juice. 
It will be palatable and nutritious. Let the remainder of the 
barley cook until it is soft enough to pass through a sieve, 
adding more water if necessary; then salt it, sweeten and 
flavor slightly with nutmeg. Pour into a mould, and when it 
is cold serve with thin cream, milk, or any ripe fruit juice, 
sweetened. 

SCRAPED BEEFSTEAK. 

One-half pound of beefsteak, butter, salt and pepper, parsley. 

This is quite simple and generally proves most acceptable, 
but to have it in perfection it is necessary that the pan should be 
very hot, the cooking done quickly, and the dish served just as 
soon as it is ready. The steak may be from the round, but must 
be juicy. Scrape off with a knife or spoon enough to make a 
cake of small size, about three-quarters of an inch thick. Take 
some of the meat from which you have scraped the material for 
this cake and cut it into pieces about an inch or two sqaure. 
Have at hand a very hot frying-pan and sear your pieces of 
meat on it. Having done this, put the meat in a lemon-squeezer 
and squeeze the juice out on the scraped beef. Now mix this 
beef and the juice together until you can shape it into a cake, 
taking care that you have a clean frying-pan very hot. Put in 
the cake and turn it once or twice with a pancake lifter. Have 



194 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

ready two hot plates. Put the cake on one, add salt, pepper and 
butter, garnish with parsley and cover with the second hot plate. 
Serve without delay. 

CLAM BROTH. 

One quart of clams, one-half cupful of cold water, one-half 
cupful of milk. It is best to use the long-neck clams, as the 
round ones have not the same delicate flavor. Wash them 
thoroughly in cold water; then put them in a stewpan and add 
the half cupful of cold water. Let them boil up quickly for five 
minutes ; then drain off the juice and strain it through a cheese- 
cloth. Put in a clean saucepan, and, after adding the milk, let 
it heat just to the boiling point. It should be served immedi- 
ately, as it \vill lose a part of its flavor by standing or by being 
reheated. It is well to serve it in a bouillon-cup with unsweet- 
ened wafers. 

MAPLE CUP CUSTARD. 

One-half pint of milk, one tablespoonful of sweet cream, one 
egg, one tablespoonful of maple sugar. With the quantities of 
ingredients mentioned above two cups of delicious custard may 
be made. The sugar should be scraped from the cake and then 
measured. After beating the egg and sugar together thor- 
oughly add the milk and cream. Then fill the cups, setting 
them in a dish of hot water, bake in a slow oven until the cus- 
tard set say, about forty minutes. Take a little care and the 
result will be perfectly satisfactory. 

DATES WITH CREAM. 

Wash a few dates thoroughly in several waters, and, after 
removing the stones, cut each date into two or three pieces, 
using a sharp knife. Place in a small bowl and add enough 
cold water to soak them well. Set this over a tea-kettle of 
boiling water for half an hour or more, so that the dates will 
swell and become soft and tender. When ready to serve, add 
sufficient cream or milk to take away the over-sw r eet taste. 

GRUEL. 

One pint of milk, one teaspoonful of flour, one teaspoonful 
of yellow cornmeal. You will need to have rather a generous 
measure of milk. Put half a cupful aside, and heat the rest in 
a double boiler. When it has become scalding hot stir into it 
the flour and cornmeal made smooth with the cold milk you re- 
served. Stir occasionally while it cooks for two hours, and be- 
fore straining add a pinch of salt. The long cooking is the 
secret of success in preparing this gruel. 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 195 

BEEF JUICE. 

Cut one pound beef into small cubes, place in an earthen bowl, 
keeping at medium heat for twelve hours. When the juice has 
been extracted, clarify with boiling water and salt to taste. 
Miss Tomasito J. Jinso, Williams, Ariz. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Six oysters, grated breadcrumbs, butter, seasoning. Of 
course you must be very particular to see that the oysters are 
nice and fresh. Beard them and take away the muscle; then, 
after covering a small saucer with the bread-crumbs, which 
should be fine, put the oysters on the crumbs and season with a 
very little cayenne pepper and salt. Add a few drops of good 
vinegar or lemon juice to the oysters ; then cover with the bread- 
crumbs and dot with tiny pieces of butter. Cook for five min- 
utes in a quick oven, or until the crumbs have turned a light 
brown. The beard or frill of the oyster when cooked curls up 
into a hard, rather indigestible piece, and spoils the delicate 
flavor of the dish. That is why it should be removed at the 
very start. 

CREAM PUNCH. 

One-half teacupful of fresh milk, one-half teacupful of cream, 
one teaspoon of sugar, one egg. Put the milk into a pint pre- 
serving-jar and add the egg, cream and sugar. Fasten the top 
on the jar carefully, and shake well for a couple of minutes; 
then pour into a glass and serve immediately. In cases of ty- 
phoid fever you should take especial care to leave out the yolk 
of the egg unless the attending physician says it would be per- 
fectly proper to give it to the patient. 

TAPIOCA PUDDING. 

One-fourth cupful of tapioca, one pint of milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one egg, salt. The tapioca should be mea- 
sured rather scantily, and should be soaked in cold water over 
night. In the morning add the milk, and cook for one hour in a 
double boiler; then add a pinch of salt and the sugar, which 
should be measured level and beaten with the yolk of the egg. 
Stir for one minute, then take from the fire. When the pudding 
is almost cold, beat the white of the egg quite stiff and fold it in. 
Flavor to taste. 

RAW BEEF SANDWICH 

A small piece of steak, two slices of bread, butter, seasoning. 
Sandwiches made in this way taste good and are quite nourish- 
ing. Usually the patient has no idea that the meat has not been 



196 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

cooked. Lay the steak on a board and scrape both sides with a 
dull knife, leaving the tough sinews. Season with salt and pep- 
per. Toast two slices of bread, and when you have buttered 
them spread the scraped meat on the toast. Turn the two slices 
together like a sandwich, cut them in strips, place them in the 
oven for a minute and then serve. 

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP. 

.One pint of chicken or veal stock, one bunch of celery, one 
small piece of onion, one tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, one cupful of milk, one cupful of cream, salt and 
pepper. With these ingredients enough soup may be made to 
serve one person three or four times. After cleaning the celery 
cut both it and the onion fine. Put into a saucepan with the 
stock and let it simmer slowly for half an hour. Beat the butter 
and flour to a smooth, light cream. Stir into this a few spoon- 
fuls of the stock ; then add this mixture to the soup. Boil for 
ten minutes and rub through a fine sieve. Return it to the sauce- 
pan and add the milk. When this boils add the cream and heat 
the soup just to the boiling point. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper and serve at once. In case you intend to serve the soup 
several times return to the saucepan only half a cupful .of the 
strained soup, adding a quarter of a cupful each of milk and 
cream and heating to the boiling point. The remainder of the 
soup may be kept in a cold place. Milk and cream being added 
and the soup heated when required. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

One cupful of tomatoes, butter, tiny pinch of soda, 
one cupful of milk, salt and pepper. Strain the cupful of 
tomatoes through a fine sieve in order to get rid of all the fiber 
and seeds. Pour the liquid into a granite kettle and add a piece 
of butter the size of 'a walnut. Heat to the boiling point. Add 
the soda, stirring well ; and when the tomato stops foaming add 
a cupful of hot milk and salt and pepper to suit your taste. If 
you like, a tablespoonful of cracker crumbs may be added also. 
Serve at once. 

BEEP TEA. 

One pound of round steak, one and one-fourth pints of cold 
water, seasoning. It is best to have the meat from the hind 
quarter. Beat it thin. Let an ungreased skillet or frying-pan 
get smoking hot, and lay the beef in it for a few minutes, until 
it turns whitish on the under side ; then turn it over and let the 
other side get in the same condition. When this has been done 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 197 

remove it from the fire at once. Cut it in small pieces, and, 
covering it with the cold water, cook it at the back of the stove, 
where it will be just below the boiling point, for three of four 
hours. Salt to taste. If you wish the broth very delicate 
remove the bone before simmering the beef. 

ALBUMEN WATER. 

Whites of two fresh eggs, juice of half a lemon, cracked ice. 
During convalescence the doctor often orders eggs, eggs, eggs, 
and sometimes it is difficult to induce the patient to accept them. 
As is frequently the case that the white of the egg is the part 
which is most desirable for the patient, the following recipe 
may be used when everything else has failed : Put the unshaken 
whites of two fresh eggs in a lemonade-glass. Add the lemon 
juice and put in enough cracked ice to make the glass half full. 
Sweeten with especial care, as patients generally make more 
objection to too much sugar than too little. Place a shaker 
over the glass and shake until the whites are thoroughly broken 
up, but not too foamy. Put in enough cold water to fill the glass 
and give to the patient at once.

MEATS] 



Broiled meats should be placed on a hot broiler, over red hot 
coals free from smoke, giving out a good heat, but not too 
brisk, or the meat will be hardened and scorched. Again, if 
the fire and coals are too low, the gravy will escape on the 
coals, creating a blaze and blackening the meat. When both 
sides are broiled, lay on hot dish, butter, and serve hot. 

When roasting beef, have a good brisk fire, in order to 
retain the juices. If the beef is tough, it will take longer with 
a slower fire. Roasts should be put in the baking pan with 
very little water using suet under the roast and browned flour 
and suet on top. Baste frequently. Or roast in a patent 
roasting pan. 

Boiling meat should be put in hot water to retain the juices 
and kept boiling until done. When a scum rises, skim off or it 
will boil into the meat and discolor it. Salt meat takes longer 
to boil and should be put in cold water. When boiling mutton 
or veal for stew, put it in hot water to cook. Soup bone must 
always be put in cold water, and boil slowly. 

L,amb, mutton, veal arid pork should be cooked slower than 
beef. An onion sliced and put on the top of roasts especially 
pork, gives it a nice flavor. 

Frying meats should be put in the skillet with little hot butter 
or fat. Many people emerge the meats in hot lard. 

"How many ways can you serve meat?" 

"Three, mum!" 

"What are they?" 

"Well done, rare and raw!" 

BACON COOKED IN THE OVEN. 

Lay the bacon, cut in very thin slices, on a double broiler, 
close the broiler, and set it in a moderate oven over a dripping 
pan. Let it cook until a delicate brown and crisp. Serve at 
once. Mrs. Geo. Barney, Williams, Ariz. 

SCRAMBLED BRAINS. 

Place in cold water three or four sets of sheep brains till all 
the blood is drawn out. Remove all skin. Put in sauce pan to 
boil, add an onion, garlic, small garden boquet, salt and pepper 
to taste. Boil well for fifteen minutes. Drain off all water and 
put in a hot dish. Have a frying pan red hot and throw in 
two good tablespoon fuls butter, brown nicely, then add one

teaspoonful vinegar. Pour this over the brains. Serve hot. 
From what is left over, delicious brain fritters can be made.

seeds. Boil ten minutes, drain well. Cut each brain in two. 
Dress platter with parsley. Serve hot. Or put black butter, 
or tartar sauce over platter. 

Butcher, to boy "I say, Pat. have you delivered Mr. Smith's joint, 
and Mrs. Jones's ribs?" 

"Yes, sir."

BEEF A LA MODE. 

Three pounds pot roast, two medium sized onions, one-half 
dozen carrots, one-half dozen potatoes, salt and pepper. An

place the roast in and let it brown on both sides. Then add 
sufficient water from time to time to keep it simmering. 
When half done put the carrots in that have been prepared by 
scraping and cutting lengthwise. Put in the onions (sliced or 
whole) with the carrots. When these are nearly done, add 
the prepared potatoes cut lengthwise. After the meat and 
vegetables have been removed add flour to liquid which makes 
a delicious gravy. Mrs. E. H. Duffield, Williams, Ariz.

ROAST BEEF WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Mix one pint sweet milk, four eggs well beaten, two scant 
cupfuls flour, one teaspoonful salt. About an hour before the 
roast is baked, pour off the fat from the baking pan, leaving 
just enough to keep batter from sticking to the pan. Pour in 
the batter. Put the oven grate over baking pan, and place 
roast on it, allowing the drippings to fall on the batter below. 
Oven should be brisk. Baste roast frequently with fat taken 
from pan and kept hot on the top of the range. Contributed, 
Saginaw, Mich. 

DELICIOUS ROAST BEEF. 

Heat the baking pan hot, then put in beef and let it brown 
well, turn over and sear the sides thoroughly. This method 
retains the juices in the meat, then put in the pan and bake until 
done, basting as necessary. The inside will be pink and juicy. 
Mrs. George Raney, Williams, Ariz. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

One cupful of sifted flour, one pint of milk, two well beaten 
eggs, salt and a pinch of baking powder. A pint of water may 
be used instead of milk in which case one tablespoonful of 
dripping may be used. Mix this batter smoothly, adding the 
eggs last. Instead of pouring the batter into the pan with 
roast it will be found an easier method at times to bake the 
pudding separately in a broad shallow pan for twenty minutes, 
cutting in squares and serving with the meat on top, and the 
gravy separating. Mrs. George Raney, Williams, Ariz.

stove with enough water to cover and let boil for about half 
an hour. Remove while boiling hard, and without lifting 
cover put in fireless cooker for from eight to twelve hours

ter. Lay it in a pan with a cupful of hot water, turn another 
pan over it and bake till nearly done. Mix a tablespoonful of 
dry French mustard and three of very fine bread crumbs to' a 
thin paste, adding alternately vinegar and butter; season this 
highly with salt, and both black and cayenne pepper. Make

meat, place in a dry pan, cover well with the paste, then return 
to the oven and roast gently till the paste is a golden brown. 
Serve with mint sauce. Contributed, Williams, Ariz.

THANKSGIVING MINCE MEAT. 

One of the best and richest of mince meats is this, that has 
been in constant use in one family for more than a generation. 

Chop fine in a meat chopper three pounds lean, tender 
cooked beef. The meat may be of roast beef or beef's tongue, 
which is used for the richest form of mince meat, or it can be 
from the round of beef, which is quite good enough for this 
purpose. Add to the meat a pound and a quarter of suet,- freed 
from strings and chopped fine, six pounds tart apples, Spitzen- 
bergs or nice Greenings, chopped in coarse bits ; six pounds

as also cold coffee or any fruit juices that have commenced 
to ferment, but not moldy. This mince meat may be scalded 
or packed away in glass jars without cooking, its richness in- 
suring its keeping. This should be allowed to ripen at least 
two weeks before using, and will last the average sized family 
from Thanksgiving until late spring. John Langowsky,

and filling with the mixture just prepared. If any is left 
pour it over the roast when it comes to the table. This is 
excellent. Mrs. J. R. Ross, Williams, Ariz. 

PEPPER POT. 

Recipe of the Union League of Philadelphia. 

Boil the tripe until tender which generally takes fifteen 
hours; when done, save the liquor to make soup. Cut up the 
tripe into small pieces, when cut up put them back into kettle 
with liquor, take some raw potatoes and cut them up into 
small pieces ; take some raw onions and also cut into small 
pieces about the size of a large pea, then put in the following 
herbs ; some sweet basil, some summer savory and a bunch of 
pot herbs ; salt to taste, and also some cayenne pepper, some 
butter. Then make some dough about one-fourth inch thick 
and make into small dumplings about the size of a gooseberry, 
put the dumpling in the pot about five hours after the 
other ingredients have been boiling, and then let the pot be 
on the fire four hours longer to cook the dumplings. Con- 
tributed, Saginaw, Mich. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Boil one large or two small year old chickens till thoroughly 
cooked, with broth to cover it when done. Make a rich bak- 
ing-powder biscuit dough, roll thin, line the sides of a deep 
three quart basin, lay in the pieces of chicken, sprinkle with 
salt, pepper and lumps of butter and drop in little pieces of 
the dough. Thicken the broth with a tablespoon of flour 
and turn in enough to cover the chicken. Roll a piece of the 
dough one-half inch thick and cover the pie. being careful to 
make holes in the cover for the steam to escape. Mrs. H. F. 
Adams, Williams, Ariz. 

ROAST YOUNG PIG.

of dry bread, moistened with warm water; add grated onion, 
one beaten egg, season with salt, pepper, sage, and savory. 
Fill the opening with above stuffing, and sew up. Stand the 
pig in a pan of water, beef stock, butter and onion, and baste 
often. Cover nose and ears with a paste jacket, if the oven 
be too hot. Bake slowly for three hours. Put a corn cob in

PORTERHOUSE STEAK AND MUSHROOMS. 

Put in granite pan two tablespoons of butter, a small onion, 
a pinch of thyme, put over the fire. When melted stir in 
slowly two tablespoons flour (taking from the hot fire while 
mixing). When it is slightly browned, add a cup of water 
and let it simmer. Add three tablespoons of beef stock, a tiny 
bit of nutmeg. Put in mushrooms and cook fifteen minutes. 
Pour over steak and serve. Mrs. R. C. Wente, Williams, 
Ariz. 

ROAST LOIN OF PORK. 

Wash and wipe the pork, score the skin with a sharp knife 
and season with salt and pepper. Place in a dripping pan, 
pour one teacupful of water in the pan and bake in a hot 
oven, allowing fifteen minutes to the pound. Baste frequently 
with the drippings in the pan. When about half done wash 
and wipe either sweet or Irish potatoes of medium size and 
put in the pan. When cooked, place the meat on a heated 
platter. Serve with its own gravy and apple sauce. Garnish 
with celery tops and pickles. Jane E. Clemmens, Ohio. 

RECIPE FOR SCRAPPLE. 

Everyone who eats the scrapple which I make finds it so pleas- 
ing to their palates that they request the directions for the 
making. Instead of using hog's head, as my mother used to 
make, I use a quarter's worth of good steak, five cents' worth of 
fresh pork, put them through the meat chopper and put on in 
water to boil until done and water is left just sufficient to take 
up corn meal to the consistency of mush. Stir very rapidly 
while slowly pouring in meal. Salt to taste and mould in a 
long, narrow, square pan. When quite cold and solid, slice in 
thin strips, dip in meal and fry in boiling lard. It makes a fine 
fish course, as few can tell it from fish. Mrs. H. A. W., Cyn- 
thiana, Ky. 

BAKED PIG'S SHOULDER. 

Cook in quite salt boiling water two hours with whole allspice 
and cloves. Take out and skin, brush the top with beaten egg, 
sprinkle seasoned bread crumbs on top and sides, with slices 
of onion. Bake an hour or until done in a slow oven. Serve 
hot with apple sauce. Garnish the platter with corn balls and 
parsley. Delicious sliced cold for next day's luncheon. Miss 
Charlotte Wickstrom, Hartford, Conn.

RIB ROAST STUFFED. 

Remove the bones from the meat, flatten the meat and pepper 
and salt well. Make a rich dressing moistened with egg. 
Pour the dressing into a hot frying pan with a little melted 
lard. Stir until thickened, spread over the meat, roll, tie and 
bake. Press and slice cold. Mrs. George Raney, Williams. 
Ariz. 

PORK TENDERLOIN ROAST. 

Split pork tenderloin lengthwise on the side, put a layer 
of dressing between the two pieces and then bind or sew them 
together. Cut a small carrot and a small onion in pieces and 
lay in the bottom of a baking pan and put the tenderloin over 
this. Put some slices of fat pork or bacon on top of the pork. 
Peel Irish potatoes and lay around the outside of the pan. 
Bake meat until tender. Select uniform sized and rather 
small potatoes, or they will not be sufficiently baked by the 
time the pork is tender. Mrs. O. Ramey, Williams, Ariz. 

INDIAN STEW. 

Cut up and stew a fowl half clone, then add a cup of raw 
.rice, a slice of ham chopped fine, pepper and salt. Let all cook 
together until the rice swells and absorbs all the gravy of 
stewed chicken. Do not allow it to get hard or dry. Serve in 
a deep dish. This may be made of many kinds of meat. Veal 
is very nice cooked in this way. Mrs. George Raney, 
Williams, Ariz. 

IRISH STEW. 

Select lean pieces of mutton cut in strips, put in about quart 
of water and stew until nearly tender ; add medium sized pota- 
toes, onions, turnips (and cabbage if desired), season to taste, 
and cook until the vegetables are tender. If liquid boils away, 
add any good stock but mutton preferred. Serve hot, meat 
and vegetables together. Contributed, Williams, Ariz. 

IRISH STEW. 

Chop mutton or beefsteak or both together; add raw pota- 
toes sliced very thin, two onions and two small carrots ; season 
with pepper and salt. Cover with water in a stew pan and 
stew gently until meat becomes tender and the potatoes are 
nearly dissolved in the gravy. Mrs. E. Pallett, Williams, 
Ariz.

MERSHOX WOODS STEW. 

In the first place take a pot that is going to be large enough 
to hold enough of the stew to at least serve each of the partici- 
pants twice, for I have found that as a rule they come back for 
the second helping. For instance, if you are going to serve 
thirty people, I should take one and one-half pounds of fat pig 
pork, salted; after cleaning and scraping thoroughly, cut 
it into very thin slices, the thinner the better. Then take a 
knuckle of veal with a few of the short ribs, fat enough to 
make an addition to the knuckle of a least a pound of the veal. 
One and one-half pounds or so of mutton, not lamb, but mut- 
ton, and I always preferred the brisket or the rib piece. One 
and one-half pounds lean beef cut into small squares, say not 
over one inch square. The veal and the mutton also want to 
be cut up. One fowl, weighing four or five pounds, and cut it 
up into eight or nine pieces. Disjoint it. Above all things, do 
not break a bone, that is, take oft the drum-sticks at the joint, 
and the second joint at the hip joint, remove each wing, then 
break the back bone into two pieces and leave the breast whole. 
If you have not the fowl, two spring chickens are even better. 
Never put a rabbit in the stew, but a partridge or a nice young 
squirrel, or a small piece of venison would be a welcome addi- 
tion. So much for the meat portion. If you have fresh par- 
snips, clean and slice about four medium sized ones, that would 
be sufficient. Potatoes are the main single ingredient, and 
after they are quartered or sliced, not too fine, you should 
have at least three quarts of them. Six or eight carrots, sliced 
onions sufficient to fill a two-quart basin; one-half dozen raw 
tomatoes if in season, or one quart can of same ; one quart can 
of corn, or half a dozen ears scraped from the cob, if in season ; 
two handfuls of lima beans, one pint shelled peas, or the canned 
article will do. If you have some of the old fashioned yellow 
rutabagas, peel and slice about four. Cut up fine one- 
half head of cabbage, a fair supply of the green gumbo, or 
failing in that, at least a pint of the canned. Now you are 
ready to begin work. 

First. Sprinkle the bottom of the kettle with the sliced po- 
tatoes, then put in a layer of salt pork, then some one of the 
other vegetables alternating with the meat, duly seasoning each 
two or three courses as follows : Be sure to get plenty of 
pepper in, I usually take six or eight little red peppers and one 
handful of pepper-corn, and in addition to this grind a few of 
the pepper-corns. If you have one or two old fashioned bell 
peppers that have gone to seed, put them in whole, but plenty 
of pepper is essential. Of course, it must be salted, but you 



WILUAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 219 

can always add salt but not take it out, so be careful about put- 
ting in too much salt. 

Have a kettle that is large enough so that when all of 
these ingredients are put in, that not to exceed two-thirds of 
its capacity has been filled. Then put in pure, cold water, 
sufficient to cover all two, two or three inches. 

Xow put it on the stove and as it comes to a boil, put it on 
the back of the stove so it will only simmer; above all things 
do not let it boil hard, but it should be kept bubbling and sput- 
tering away just to about a boil, practically, for fully two and 
one-half hours. It would be good for nothing if it is any less 
than this. It is better if it cooks four or five in this same way. 
Leave the cover off the pot so it will evaporate some, occa- 
sionally skimming it. 

Serve it as a soup or soup-course, and you will find that if 
it comes on the table hot and all right that your guests will 
want very little else for dinner, and it is perfectly admissible 
to come back, like Oliver Twist, for more. Wm. B. Mershon, 
Saginaw, Mich. 

CREAMED SWEETBREADS. 

Soak sweetbreads in salt and water over night. If young, 
boil in hot water fifteen minutes. Drain and remove the sin- 
ews. Pick to pieces and stew five minutes in butter gravy, 
seasoned with pepper and salt. Squeeze in some lemon juice 
just before serving. Garnish with water cress and serve on 
toast or in any desired way. If any remains after the meal, 
make a salad for the next day. Miss Charlotte Wickstrom, 
Hartford, Conn. 

SWEETBREADS AND MUSHROOMS. 

Two small pairs sweetbreads, parboil, remove all strings and 
fibre and cut each one into two pieces. Heat one tablespoon 
butter and lay them in. Saute quickly, turning them once. 
Sprinkle with salt and lay on hot dish one-half can mushrooms 
cut in halves. Drop these into the pan, add one-fourth cup 
cream, thicken quickly with one tablespoon flour and when it 
bubbles stir smooth and remove from the pan. Pour the whole 
on a hot dish around the sweetbreads. J. W. Bayles, Williams, 
Ariz.

heaping tablespoonful of butter into which mix one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, one 
can of French mushrooms; boil these together for a few min- 
utes stirring to keep from burning. Green peas can 
be used instead of mushrooms. Chicken can be used in place 
of sweetbreads when thoroughly boiled. Mrs. E. B. Perrin. 
Williams, Ariz. 

SWEETBREADS AND BACOX. 

Parboil the sweetbreads, drain them and remove the gristle 
and fat. Dip into beaten egg, which is seasoned with salt and 
pepper, roll in cracker crumbs and fry in the pan in which 
bacon has been fried. Drain and serve with the slices of bacon. 
Contributed, Williams, Ariz. 

SWEETBREADS.

Make a dough as for pie crust, roll it out in a round piece 
about as big as the ordinary saucer. In the center of this put 
a flat thin cake of fresh sausage meat and roll it up in the crust, 
pinching the ends together just as if you were making an apple 
dumpling. Put it in the oven and bake until done, which will 
usually be twenty- five or thirty minutes. Contributed.

seven or eight fresh tomatoes or one quart canned tomatoes 
and salt to taste. Line bottom of large granite baking pan with 
mush then with layers of tamale well clotten with olives and

MENUS, LUNCHEONS, SPECIAL DINNERS 
AND TABLE ARRANGEMENTS 



"O hour of all hours, the most bless'd upon earth, 
Blessed hour of our dinners!" 

Lucile. 

MENUS. 

"Variety is the spice of life." 

While these menus are simple and in some ways compara- 
tively complete, it is not to be supposed that they can always be 
carried out in detail. They will, however furnish suggestions 
to housekeepers and entertainers who are daily perplexed with 
the question : "What shall we have to eat today ?" 

On the table spread the cloth, 

Let the knives be sharp and clean; 
Pickles get and salad both, 

Let them each be fresh and green.

THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 



DINNER TABLE ARRANGEMENT. 

The first requisites for a well appointed table are immaculate 
linen, sparkling cut glass and china, and well polished silver. 
The centerpiece is either of cut flowers, a fern or fruit. At 
each cover a service plate is laid; upon this plate the one con- 
taining an appetizer, or clams or oysters, is placed. Knives, 
forks and spoons are laid one-half inch from the edge of the 
table and are arranged in the order in which they will be used, 
the first required being placed farthest from the plate. The 
knives are arranged on the right of the plate. To the right of 
the knives lay the spoon for the soup, just outside of this place 
the oyster fork, then the spoons as needed. To the left of plate 
are the forks with their tines turned up : the fish fork, then roast 
fork, and the salad fork close to the plate. A folded napkin may 
be laid upon the service plate if the first course is not already 
upon the table. Place cards are about the size of the conven- 
tional visiting card. The water tumbler is placed at the end of 
the knife nearest the plate. The service plate should not be 
removed until the meat course is brought in. Whatever is 
served should be set down at the right, whatever passed offered 
from the left, that the guest may4ielp himself. No tray is used, 
but the maid may have a folded napkin in her hand upon which 
to hold the plates which she puts before the guest. Mrs. K. W. 
Williams, Cynthiana, Ky.

BOY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY. 

(Prize from N. F. Magazine, Mrs. Woody.) 

The table was so much admired at my boy's birthday party, 
I will send a description. 

The cover was made of cotton batting and over this was 
thickly spread diamond dust. Smilax was pinned in festoons to 
form a border, circling up around each plate. A flat center- 
piece of large feathery ferns was held in place by a five-burner 
silver candelabra with pink candles and shades. At either end 
tall cut glass vases held many pink carnations. Gliding from 
one to another and wrapping in and around the center was pink 
ribbon, and, as though stepping aside to avoid being caught in 
it, tiny china shepherdesses' in pink held aloft pink candles. 
Placer plates had decorations of pinks and ferns. 

Cakes and ices carried out the color scheme, and when the 
bright faces of the little folk surrounded the table, it made a 
glittering and beautiful picture.

RECIPE FOR COOKING HUSBANDS. 

One of the lecturers before the Baltimore cooking school 
gave the following recipe for cooking husbands : 

"A good many husbands are utterly spoiled by mismanage- 
ment. Some women go about it as if their husbands were 
bladders, and blow them up. Others keep them constantly in 
hot water. Others let them freeze by their carelessness and 
indifference. Some keep them in a stew by irritating ways 
and words; others roast them. Some keep them in pickle all 
their lives. It cannot be supposed that any husband will be 
tender and good, managed in this way, but they will be truly 
delicious when properly treated. In selecting your husband 
you should not be guided by the silvery appearance, as in buy- 
ing mackerel, nor by the golden tint, as if you wanted salmon. 
Be sure to select him yourself, as tastes differ. Do not go to 
the market for him as the best are always brought to your door. 
It is far better to have none unless you will patiently learn how 
to cook him. A preserving kettle of the finest porcelain is the 
best, but if you have nothing but an earthenware pipkin it will 
do with care. See that the line in which you wrap him is nicely 
washed and mended, with the required number of buttons and 
strings tightly sewed on. Tie him in the kettle with a strong 
silk cord called comfort, as the one called duty is apt to be weak. 
Make a clear, steady fire out of love, neatness and cheerfulness. 
Set him as near this as seems to agree with him. If he sputters 
and frizzes do not be anxious ; some husbands do this until they 
are quite done. Add a little sugar in the form of what confec- 
tioners call kisses, but no vinegar or pepper on any account. A 
little spice improves him, but it must be used with judgment. 
Do not stick any sharp instruments into him to see if he is be- 
coming tender. Stir him gently, watching the while, lest he lie 
too flat and close to the kettle and so become useless. You can- 
not fail to know when he is done. If thus treated you will find 
him very relishable, agreeing nicely with you and the children, 
and he will keep as long as you want unless you become care- 
less and set him in too cold a place." 



MISCELLANEOUS 



FOll RATTLESNAKE BITE. 

Apply soda slightly moistened to make a paste to the wound. 
When it becomes discolored, remove and put on a fresh appli- 
cation until the soda ceases to be discolored. Contributed. 

THE BUG REMEDY. 

Ammonia, corosive sublimate, terpentine. The Williams 
Drug Company knows how,to proportion it. It is decidedly the 
best ever used. 

Quick silver and white of an egg destroys bed bugs. Con- 
tributed. 

NECESSITIES. 

Beef stock will be found useful for gravies, sauces, etc. Beef 
stock will not keep longer than a week. 

Browned flour is always useful and should be kept on hand. 

THE DOUGLASS MIXTURE. 

This ought to be printed everywhere : One-half popnd cop- 
peras, one ounce sulphuric acid and two gallons soft water. 
Be careful with the sulphuric acid. Let settle twenty-four 
hours and drain off. Put in bottles or stone jars. Add one tea- 
spoonful of the mixture to each pint of drinking water for fowls. 

"Since I've been married I don't get half enough to eat." 
"Well, you must remember that we are one now." 

When frying eggs after frying bacon or ham, sprinkle flour 
in the pan to prevent eggs from sticking to pan. Contributed. 

SURE DEATH TO FLIES. 

Instead of bothering with sticky fly paper, try this method : 
Put two teasponfuls of formaldehyde in a pint of water, pour 
into saucers and set on table. Flies are attracted and drink the 
water; some die in water and others drop near and are easily 
swept up and burned. 

FOR MOTHS. 

Saturate an old sheet with formaldehyde and hang up in the 
closet, first stopping up both cracks and keyhole and leave for 
twenty-four hours. One or two such applications through the 
season will prove sufficient. 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 255 

TO SET COLOR IN SUMMER DRESSES. 

Plunge them into boiling water with one tablespoonful of 
coarse salt which has been previously melted. The color in the 
daintiest gown will not fade hereafter. Mrs. Finney, Wil- 
liams, Ariz. 

How to gain flesh buy a butcher shop. 
HAND LOTION. 

Two ounces of glycerine, five ounces alcohol, one dram am- 
monia, ten drops carbolic acid, one dram extract violet. 

HAIR TONIC. 

One ounce lanoline, one ounce coco butter or lard, one dram 
coal oil, one-half dram tincture cantharides, one-hal fdram lis- 
terine, one-half dram oil peppermint. Melt lanoline, slowly add 
lard and then others. Apply two or three times per week to the 
roots of the hair with tips of fingers. Rub in thoroughly with 
balls of fingers. 

"I saw a big rat in my cook-stove and when I went for my revolver 
he ran out." 

"Did you shoot him?" 

"No; he was out of my range." 

CARE OF CHILDREN'S TEETH. 

The first thing to be said in regard to children' teeth is never 
alloiv a pacifier under any circumstances, not only because it is 
not sanitary, but because, it in each and every case causes a de- 
formity that can never be perfectly corrected in after life by 
surgery or otherwise. 

Thumb sucking is almost or quite as bad, so mothers, do not 
allow your little ones to continue this habit, because is looks 
"cute" while baby is tiny, as the time will come when baby is an 
Over-grown boy or girl and it does not look cute, and in the 
meantime, the damage has been done. If the teeth protrude, the 
upper bone in the mouth has become misshapen and the whole 
facial expression has changed for life and no two teeth in the 
mouth will ever be in the place intended for them, thus causing 
mouth breathing, which in turn causes "adenoids" or other 
trouble with the throat and nose. ' 

After two years a child is supposed to have all the temporary 
or baby teeth, which should be cleaned (with a nice little brush 
all his own) every day by mother, and closely watched for small 
black spots, which as soon as found must receive the family 
dentists' care. Often these little spots appear as early as three 



256 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

I 

years, and if taken in time may be treated by him without any 
drilling or filling, which in most cases is quite distressing to the 
little one. However, these twenty teeth must be kept in their 
proper places until time for them to be replaced by the permanent 
ones, which only begin to appear at six years, and if a child has 
never been taken to the dentist before, it must be taken at the age 
of six. Mothers, if you wish healthy, beautiful teeth for your 
little ones, remember this. Florence R. Atkinson, D. D. S., 
Chicago, 111. 

Jars To prevent: Coax "husbands" to buy "Williams Library Asso- 
ciation Cook Book." 

CURRY POWDER. 

Two ounces mustard, two ounces black pepper, six ounces 
coriande seed, six ounces tumeric, one-half ounce red pepper, 

one ounce cardaman, one ounce cummin seed and ground 
cinnamon. Pound fine, put in a bottle, cork tight and keep 
for seasoning gravies, etc. Mrs. \\'m. F. Dermont, Williams, 
Ariz. 

TO KEEP NEEDLES. 

A soda mint bottle, with a little screw top, makes an excellent 
holder for needles, to keep in the workbag. It is especially good 
for damp climates, as the needles will not rust. It can be made 
a thing of beauty by covering it with a bit of the material of 
which the bag is made (preferably silk, as this will work up bet- 
ter) ; and a workbag given for a present is doubly acceptable if 
some such little thing as this is added to give a distinctive touch. 

SMALL POX AND SCARLET FEVER REMEDY. 

One grain sulphate zinc, one grain Fox Glove (digitalas), half 
teaspoon sugar. Mix with two teaspoons of water, when 
thoroughly mixed, add four ounces of water. Take a table- 
spoon every hour. Contributed. 

TO TAKE SPOTS OUT OF WOOL IX CLOTH. 

Two ounces of ammonia, one ounce castile soap, one-four 
ounce saltpeter, one quart rain water. Mrs. Geo. A. Cole, 
Middletown, Conn. 

RECIPE FOR REMOVING GREASE SPOTS. 

One pint aqua ammonia, one-half pound best white soap, 
one ounce saltpetre, one gallon water. Shave the soap fine, add 
the water, boil until soap is dissolved. Let it get cold, add 
salt petre, stirring- until dissolved. Strain, let suds settle, skim 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 257 

off dry suds, add ammonia. Bottle and cork at once. Direc- 
tions for use : For grease spots pour upon the article to be 
cleaned a quantity, rubbing well with a clean sponge, and ap- 
plying to both sides of the article you are cleaning. Upon car- 
pets or coarse goods when the grease is hard and dry use a stiff 
brush, and wash with clear, cold water. One application is all 
that is necessary for fresh grease spots, but for old and dried 
a second may- be required. For Shampooing: Take a small 
quantity with an equal quantity of water, .apply to hair with 
stiff brush, and wash out with clear water. For Cleaning Sil- 
ver Ware, etc. : Buy five cents worth of whiting, mix a small 
quantity, rub with rag. For Killing Bed Bugs : Apply to places 
they frequent. It will not injure the finest laces or silk. 
John B. Campbell, Williams, Ariz. 

TO WASH CENTERPIECE. 

Never put the embroidered centerpiece in with the family 
laundry. Wash them by themselves in suds of warm water 
and pure soap. The ordinary yellow kitchen soap is altogether 
too strong for delicate work. Wash by rubbing between the 
hards, and rinse well in two clear waters. In wringing, put it 
between, two towels and twist. The object is to keep the parts 
of the embroidery from touching each other and prevent the 
colors from running. Let the piece get nearly dry, place it on a 
well-padded ironing board, lay a piece of white cloth over it 
and press with the iron. Do not have the iron hot enough to 
steam. Do not press too hard or it will mat the threads in the 
embroidery. In case a part of the linen should get too dry, lay a 
damp cloth on it and press over that. Contributed. 

TO TAKE IRON-RUST OUT OF LINEN. 

Put two or three pints of water in the tea-kettle and let come 
to a boil. Rub the spots on linen with fresh cut lemon and 
hold over spout of the kettle. If spot does not disapepar re- 
peat until it does. Mrs. Tom Smith. 

Don't pick a quarrel before it's ripe. 

TO WASH POINT LACE, TATTING OR ANY DOILY WITH LACE 

EDGE. 

Cleanse gently with warm water and a pure, white soap, 
squeezing, not wringing. Have the last rinsing water in a 
vessel sufficiently large that the doily will float out flat, then 
slip under it an old napkin or towel, roll up, and let lay a 
while before ironing. With such a process the edges do not 
mat, but may be shaken out like new. 



258 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

TO WASH BEDDING, OR OVERALLS, OR ANY HEAVY GARMENT. 

Lay article flat on table or washboard and with ordinary 
scrub-brush, soap and warm water, scrub thoroughly on one 
side then on the other until all parts have been covered. In 
rinsing, souse it up and down in clean water and hang up to 
dry without wringing, By this method there will be no streaks 
or wrinkles in the garments. 

\Yhen cooking anything which is likely to borl over, such as 
rice, macaroni, breakfast foods, postum cereal, etc., add a small 
quantity of butter when the food is placed on the stove and all 
trouble will be avoided. 

"A pint is a pound the world around."

OYSTERS 



OYSTERS A L' AMBROSIA. 

Take three dozen oysters and cut them into dice ; make some 
white sauce by taking some of the oyster liquor; put this with 
a little red pepper and half a cupful of milk into a basin, then 
put a heaping tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan over the 
fire; take a tablespoonful of flour and mix it into a paste with 
a little of the oyster liquor, and then add the strained liquor 
to it ; pour into the saucepan with the melted butter, and cook 
it over the fire until thick ; remove from the fire and add the 
juice of half a lemon, add to this one cupful of liquid aspic 
jelly, and then stir in the chopped oysters very lightly and a gill 
of cream; turn out on a plate and place on ice till cold and 
firm. When it is so, shape it into round balls of equal size, 
about the size of tangerine oranges ; smoothe them over with a 
knife clipped into hot water, and place on ice, or mold them 
into balls. Have ready some stiff aspic jelly flavored 
with a few drops of chili vinegar, and when it is in a semi-liqui- 
fied state and beginning to set, clip each oyster ball into it. This 
is best clone by running a thread through each ball and dipping 
into the jelly, or lining the balls with aspic and filling in with 
the oyster mixture. They should be colored red, green, yellow 
and white, and arranged in a pile like cannon shot; shredded 
celery, sippets of lemon, and chopped aspic may be used as 
garnish. 

OYSTERS IN BLANKETS. 

Have thin slices of bacon, roll each oyster in a slice and 
fasten with a small toothpick. Have the frying pan quite hot ; 
put in the rolls and cook till the bacon is crisp, pouring off the 
fat as it accumulates in the pan. Serve on fingers of crisp 
toast. Mrs. W. F. Dinney, Williams, Ariz. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL.. 

Three teaspoons horseradish, three teaspoons vinegar, five 
teaspoons lemon juice, one-half teaspoon tobasco sauce, salt to 
taste, and one pint of oysters. Mix and serve in tall, thin 
glasses. This recipe will serve six people. Mrs. Roy Perkins, 
Williams, Ariz. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL.. 

Mix together the strained parts : One-half lemon, one-half 
teaspoonful vinegar, eight drops tobasco sauce, one-third tea- 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 261 

spoonful mixed horseradish, one-half teaspoonful tomato cat- 
sup. Let this stand until needed, in a cool place. Have glass 
in which this is served very cold and pour the above ingredients 
over four or five small oysters. Miss Alma Peterson, Trout 
Creek, Mich. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL. 

Mix together the strained parts of, one-half lemon, one-half 
teaspoonful vinegar, eight drops tobasco sauce, one-third tea- 
sponful prepared horseradish, one-half teaspoonful tomato cat- 
sup. Add dozen small Bluepoints, let stand five minutes. Keep 
on ice until needed. Serve two or three oysters in each glass or 
dish. Delicious. Mrs. M. S. Carpenter, Hackensack, N. J. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL. 

One cup chili sauce, five drops lemon juice, one-half tea- 
sponful mixed horseradish, three drops Worcestershire sauce, 
two drops tobasco sauce. Season with pepper and salt to taste. 
Set on ice until ready to serve. Serve four small oysters in 
each glass or dish, pouring above ingredients over oysters. 
This serves six persons. Mrs. Dermont, Williams, Ariz. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL,. 

One teaspoon of grated horseradish, one tablespoon of to- 
mato catsup, one tablespoon of white wine vinegar, one table- 
spoon of lemon juice, one-half teaspoon of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoon of white pepper, a little less of paprika. This makes 
enough for twelve glasses. Place six oysters in each glass and 
pour over, and leave twenty minutes or more in a very cold 
place before serving. Mrs. Dan Bradley, Manistee, Mich. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL. 

Open eight small bluepoints over a basin, being sure to save 
all the liquor ; season with two dessertspoonfuls of catsup, six 
drops of lemon juice, two drops of Worcestershire sauce; a 
dash of tobasco sauce ; season to taste with pepper and salt. Set 
on ice until ready to serve. Serve five in small, high-stemmed 
glasses. Mrs. Dermont, Williams, Ariz. 

CREAMED OYSTERS OX TOAST. 

Drain off liquor of twenty-five small oysters, one cup white 
sauce, one-half teaspoon lemon juice. 

White Sauce (for Above). 

Two teaspoons butter, two and one-half tablespoons flour, 
one cup hot milk, one-third teaspoon celery salt and pepper 



262 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

mixed. Melt the butter, add the flour and stir quickly, add the 
hot milk very slowly. Cook over moderate heat until thick; 
add seasoning. Put oysters in a granite pan without water; 
stir slightly. Soon as heated sufficient liquor comes from them 
to prevent burning. \Yhen the edges curl they are cooked. 
Drain, saving the liquor; add the lemon juice to the oysters 
and add the oysters to the hot white sauce, mixing well ; use 
the liquor to soften the toast. Serve at once on toast. Miss 
Elva Burns, Cliffs, Ariz. 

OYSTER DARIOL.S. 

Take twelve oysters and plump them, strain and cut into 
dice. Blend together in a saucepan over the fire two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of butter with two heaping tablespoonfuls of

WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 263 

finely chopped cold chicken and six mushrooms, also chopped 
up. Put these into a saucepan, strain in the oyster liquor, and 
set the pan on a slow fire. Stir in the yolks of two eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of cream and a very little salt and red pepper. 
Stir gently until the mixture thickens, and when quite thick, 
turn it out to cool on a plate. When it is cold, form it into 
little cork-shaped rolls about two inches long. Cut some very 
thin pieces of rather fat bacon about two and a half inches 
broad by three inches long. On the smaller side of each of 
these lay a piece of the mixture, so that it will have the three- 
inch length to wrap around, fold it into little rolls, and dip 
these in batter. Fry in smoking hot fat, drain, and serve 
very hot. Contributed, Milwaukee, Wis. 

MOCK OYSTERS. 

To' the contents of a can of corn add a half cupful of milk, 
two eggs, a half teaspoonful of salt and flour enough to make

three tablespoonfuls of cream. Separate the yolks from the 
whites of the eggs, beat the yolks with a fork, and add the 
cream ; beat up the whites of the eggs stiffly, add them to the 
yolks, cream and salt, pepepr and paprika. Melt a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter in an omelet pan, pour in the mixture, 
then put the oysters and mushrooms in the center of the pan, 
and cook for four minutes. Serve immediately. Contributed. 

OYSTERS FOR PATTIES. 

Pint of small oysters and liquor put on fire, add butter half 
the size of an egg, one-half cupful sweet cream; salt and pepper 
to taste. Let come to a good scald. If not thick enough add 
teaspoonful flour. Put in crusts just before serving. Con- 
tributed, Flagstaff, Ariz. 

OYSTER PATTIE FILLING. 

One cup of oyster liquor, one cup cream, heated and thick- 
ened with two tablespoons of flour, one-half teaspoon salt, one- 
half teaspoon white pepper. Scald oyster (allowing as many 
as you please for each pattie) until the gills open. While 
these are scalding, beat the yolks of two eggs. Now draw the 
hot dressing to the back of the stove and add the oysters 
(drained from the liquid) and the yolks of eggs, stirring until 



264 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

like a custard and not a bit longer ; keep very hot by setting in 
a dish of hot water. Serve as soon as possible, filling the pattie 
shells generously. Mrs. A. O. Wheeler, Manistee, Mich. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Line some deep gem pans with puff paste, put a teaspoonful 
of cream into each, sprinkle with chopped parsley and a little 
tarragon and chervil, and season with mace, red pepper, and 
nutmeg to taste. Put two oysters in each of the patties, sprin- 
kle with a little grated lemon rind and a small quantity of 
lemon juice, moisten with oyster liquor, cover with bread 
crumbs, garnish the tops with a ring of puff paste, place on a 
baking tin, and bake in a hot oven for a quarter of an hour. 
Serve as soon as they are done on a hot dish garnished with 
sprigs of water cress. Contributed. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Saute a small slice of ham in pieces of its own fat until 
brown, then cut into strips an inch wide and two inches long. 
This size makes easy service. Cover with boiling water and 
simmer until tender; then add to the casserole with a pint of 
oysters ; dot with butter and dust with pepper, adding more salt 
if the ham should not be extra salt. Cover with little balls 
made of raised bread dough, placing them about half an inch 
apart. Cook in a moderate oven until the crust is done and 
delicately browned. If preferred, the biscuits may be made 
from baking powder mixture. It is much better to cut the 
dough into biscuits for the cover as it bakes better and is less 
liable to become doughy and soggy. The bread dough must 
have extra shortening added to it so that it will not be as tough 
as required for bread. The balls are made after the second 
rising. Contributed. 

SHREDDED WHEAT OYSTER, MEAT OR VEGETABLE PATTIES. 

Cut oblong cavity in top of biscuit, remove top carefully and 
all inside shreds, forming a shell. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, put small pieces of butter in bottom, and fill the shell 
with drained, picked and washed oysters. Season with addi- 
tional salt and pepper. Replace top of biscuit over oysters, 
then bits of butter on top. Place in a covered pan and bake 
in a moderate oven. Pour oyster liquor or cream sauce over 
it. Shell fish, vegetables, or meats may also be used. Con- 
tributed.

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Place in bake dish a layer of seasoned bread crumbs, next a 
layer of seasoned oysters, and so on until your dish is filled. 
Between each layer, pour over it, the mixed liquor, beaten egg, 
and little pieces of butter. If more moisture is needed, use 
sweet milk. On the top put moistened cracker crumbs. Bake 
twenty-five minutes. Serve hot with lemon in quarters. Mrs. 
Wm. F. Dermont, Williams, Ariz. 

OYSTERS IN THEIR SHELLS. 

Dissolve two ounces of butter in a saucepan, add a tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley and a dessertspoonful of chopped 
mushrooms ; add twelve oysters with their liquor, season with 
a little salt, red pepper and a pinch of grated nutmeg. When 
the oysters are hot add one hard cooked egg, cut into slices. 
Allow the whole to simmer for five minutes, and fill the oyster 
shells with this. Cover it with a mixture of bread crumbs and 
grated cheese, and sprinkle with a few drops of melted butter. 
Brown the top, and serve hot, garnished with parsley.

PASTRY AND PIES 



"What moistens the lip, and what brightens the eye; 
What calls back the past like the rich pumpkin pie." 

The butter for pastry should be firm and tough. For pie 
paste the lard should be fresh and firm, and the pastes mixed with 
ice water and worked up in a cool place till ready to be baked. 
To prevent the shrinking of puff paste, it should rest after it 
is made ready for the oven, and be kept in a cool place from 
fifteen to thirty minutes. 

The baking of pastry requires a brisk heat. Puff paste 
hotter than pie paste or crust. Puff paste should not be baked 
with other articles which make steam, because this prevents 
rising ; and when the pies and patties have risen, the heat may 
be decreased by opening the damper to prevent taking too 
much color. To bake patties and other puff paste goods, the 
pans should be wet with water, and not greased. For pie paste 
the tins and tart forms require greasing. In pie making two 
kinds of paste are used. The paste for the upper crust is much 
richer than that used for bottom crust, because if the rich 
crust were used for the bottom it would become too soggy. 
The trimmings left over from top crust can be used for the 
under crust next day. 

To obtain a nice deep baked crust, roll out the bottom a little 
thicker than usual, trim the sides, and prick the paste all over 
with a fork, to prevent blistering; dust with a little flour, plac- 
ing an empty pie tin with a clean bottom on the top of the 
paste (the bottom of the tin may be greased lightly to prevent 
adhering to the paste). Put the bottom crust in oven and 
bake. When the paste which shows between the two tins 
begins to color, the top tin may be removed and the baking 
finished. Cream and lemon filling for open pies should be filled 
in the oven while hot. 

CHERRY TARTS. 

Drain one can preserved cherries. Make a delicate crust 
and line a pie tin. Bake light brown. Fill with the cherries 
and cover with juice off the can boiled dow r n thick with 
more sugar. Turn this hot very slowly over the fruit and set 
in a warm oven fifteen minutes. Serve cold with or without 
cream, J. W. Baylis, Williams, Ariz.. 



268 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

CHEESE TARTS. 

One cup of sugar, one cup of currants, one lemon (grated 
rind and pulp), two beaten eggs. Boil all together, line pie 
pan or tart form with pie crust, put in filling and bake. Mrs. 
Louis Wuichet, Chicago, 111. 

DATE TARTS.

five times, two pounds of almonds chopped fine, one and one- 
fourth pounds of dates chopped fine, one-half teaspoonful of 
vanilla; beat eggs stiff, gradually add sugar, add one-half of 
dates and one-half of nuts, mix, add rest of dates, nuts, and 
vanilla. Grease and flour pans. Miss Dempsey, Manistee, 
Michigan. 

CIXXAMOX TARTS. 

Ingredients One cup brown sugar, one-half cup butter, one- 
fourth teaspoon cinnamon mixed with three tablespoons gran- 
ulated sugar, one egg, one-half teaspoon baking powder, one 
and one-half cups flour, blanched almonds or seeded raisins. 
Method Sugar to remove lumps, before measuring. Cream 
the butter, add the sugar, thoroughly beaten eggs and the 
baking powder sifted with the flour. Roll thin as possible, cut 
in diamond shape with a thin knife, brush top with beaten white 
of egg, sprinkle little cinnamon and sugar and place on butter 
sheet and bake eight minutes in a slow oven. A sheet 'is better 
than a pan, the latter retains too much heat. Mrs. Richardson, 
Los Angeles, Calif. 

"A pint is a pound the world around." 
QUICK PUFF PASTE. 

One-half pound (one-half pint) cold butter, one-half pound 
cold flour. Chop the butter into the flour in small lumps about 
the size of dice; sprinkle with ice water, just enough to hold 
together, and mix very light. Put on flour dusted bake 
board, and press into a square shape; roll out half an inch 
thick and fold iq three ; give one more turn and give a rest ; 
give three more turns (five altogether), and it is ready for use. 
The same mixture may be made with the addition of one tea- 
spoon baking powder. Mix baking powder in the flour.

HOW TO MAKE CREAM PUFFS. 

Put half a pint of water and four level tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter into a saucepan, sift and measure half a pint of flour. 
When the water is boiling and the butter thoroughly melted 
turn in hastily the flour and stir rapidly over the fire. In a mo- 
ment you will have a perfectly smooth, soft dough, free from 
stickiness. Take from the fire and stand it aside until partly 
cool. Break an egg into a cup, then turn it into the batter, 
beat for a moment, then add another and another; beat thor- 
oughly and add a fourth, breaking each into the cup first, for 
one bad egg would spoil the whole mixture. After the last egg 
beat the batter for five minutes and stand it aside in a cool 
place for an hour and a half, then drop by tablespoonfuls into 
greased shallow pans and bake in a moderate oven for thirty- 
five or forty minutes. When the puffs are done they will be 
hollow and perfectly light. The batter must be dropped far 
enough apart to leave room for swelling. 

To make the filling put half a pint of milk in a double boiler. 
Mix a tablespoonful of flour, half a tablespoonful of cornstarch 
and six tablespdonfuls of sugar. Add nastily the hot milk ; 
stir, pour the mixture back into the double boiler and stir and 
cook until thick and smooth. Then add one egg beaten until 
very light, cook just a minute, take from the fire, add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and turn the mixture out to cool. Con- 
tributed, Williams, Ariz. 

CREAM PIE.

WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 289 

be used if desired. There should be a cupful of the chicken dice. 
Season with salt, white pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. Cook 
together in a saucepan a tablespoonful, each of butter and 
flour, and, when these are blended, pour upon them a cupful 
of rich milk half cream, if you have it and stir to a smooth 
white sauce. Put the saucepan in an outer pan of boiling water 
and stir into it the chicken. If more seasoning is needed, add 
it, and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. When heated through, 
fill pastry shells with the mixture, set in the oven until very hot, 
and serve. 

CREAMED CHICKEN AND MUSHROOMS. 

Parboil a good sized chicken. Boil liquor down until it 
makes three-fourths of a pint. Boil fresh mushrooms in 
water with salt, about twenty minutes. Then cut up the 
chicken and mushrooms and mix.. Take one-half pint of 
cream, let come to a boil, add the liquor and a big tablespoon 
of butter, salt and pepper to taste, and thicken with flour. 
Then add the chicken and mushrooms and cook about fifteen 
minutes. Will serve six or eight people. Mrs. Charles M. 
Smith, Thomasville, Ga. 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

Select half-grown chicken, scald, clean, dress and disjoint. 
Roll pieces in flour seasoned with pepper and salt. Put in 
covered pan in hot butter, over medium hot fire. Serve hot. 

Gravy for Above. 

Pour about a quart of milk into the hot frying pan from 
which the chicken has been taken, allowing it to boil up good.

into the gravy left, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of cream 
or milk; season with salt, pepper and parsley, if desired, and let 
boil up. Then gravy is ready to serve. Mrs. James Kennedy, 
Williams, Ariz. 



290 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

A pair of spring chickens about two pounds each in weight. 
Draw, singe and be most careful to get all pin feathers off. Cut 
off the wings, neck, legs. Take the ends of the wings, the 
necks and giblets, all but the livers. Cover with cold water 
and a pinch of .salt. Boil until very tender using the liquid for 
the gravy and the giblets, to chop in it. Serve the back and 
breast, leaving the breast whole and the back as well, using 
the upper neck piece for stewing. Take a clean linen cloth and 
wring it frequently out of cold, clear water carefully wiping 
each piece before flouring. After each piece is wiped off flour 
very thickly with pastry flour into which salt and pepper has 
been freely shaken. Have two iron spiders on the stove with a 
large piece of butter in each, allowing it to get very hot. 
When you feel sure that the butter is hot lay the two breasts 
in right side dow r n, allowing both halves to brown nicely, the 
backs, second joints, legs and wings after the skin side is well 
browned. Turn each piece over onto the bone side and cover 
the spiders tightly, pouring a very little of the gravy from the 
giblets in the bottom to create a steam. Cook very slowly for 
fifteen or twenty minutes, lift out on a hot platter, garnish 
with parsley. 

Gravy. 

Into the hot butter sift a tablespoon of flour and stir in the 
liquid from the giblets and allow to thicken smoothly, stirring 
all the time. Chop the giblets fine, add, and allow all to come to 
a boil. Serve in gravy boat. Do not pour on the chicken. 
Wm. B. Mershon, Saginaw, Mich. 

KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN. 

Genuine Kentucky fried chicken must be sampled to be fully 
appreciated. Cut up your chicken and soak it for about an 
hour in salted water. Season some flour with sage or prepared 
poultry dressing, pepper and salt and roll the pieces of chicken 
in it. Put into a frying-pan just enough lard to a little more 
than cover the bottom of the pan. This will insure that deli- 
cate brown which always distinguishes genuine Kentucky fried 
chicken. Put the pan in the oven, instead of on the top of 
the stove, as the chicken will cook more evenly and thoroughly 
and will not burn before done, as otherwise it is apt to do. 
Lard is preferable to either butter or pork because it does not 
burn so quickly. If the oven is not too hot, and the frying has 
not been too rapid, by the time the chicken is nicely browned 
you can depend upon its being thoroughly cooked. Miss Helen 
M. Richardson, Massachusetts. 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 291 

CHICKEN MARYLAND. 

If possible, select small fowl. Split down the back, having 
iirst been prepared carefully in the usual way. Should the fowl 
be large, disjoint it. Season well, run with flour and then in a 
mixture composed of an egg beaten with a spoonful of cream. 
Then dust with sifted crumbs. Heat clarified butter plain 
may be used and when hot, fry the chicken in this slowly, 
turning over many times until it is an even dark yellow. It 
should have a nice, rich color and if fried slowly and frequently 
turned, this is very easy to obtain. Fry about fifteen minutes, 
then put in covered dish of porcelain or something that will 
stand the heat and put into slow oven for ten minutes. With 
the butter left in the pan, make a cream sauce by mixing two 
spoonfuls of flour, then adding a pint of cream and milk 
mixed, salt and pepper. Do not make it too thick. Chicken 
Maryland is always served with corn fritters and strips of 
broiled bacon, this placed on the platter with the fowl. 

Corn Fritters for Above. 

It is preferable to use fresh corn, although the canned may 
be used. Chop until it looks grated, or grate the ears on a 
greater. Make a batter, using the proportions of a cup of flour 
to a cup and a half of milk, one beaten egg and a pinch of 
salt. This makes a thin fritter. If a thick, puffy one is de- 
sired, add more flour and use baking powder, a teaspoonful to 
two cups of flour. Mrs. E. B. Perrin, Williams, Ariz. 

CHICKEN PATTIES. 

Make a nice rich puff paste. Cut a round from it with a 
medium large cookie cutter, and with a smaller size cutter, cut 
out the middle? of the round, thus leaving a ring. Bake to a 
light brown in a quick oven. Then brush them over with 
beaten egg, and put in the oven one minute to glaze. Fill these 
crusts with minced boiled chicken well seasoned and beaten 
well into a white sauce made of the water in which the chicken 
was boiled. Serve hot. Contributed, Flagstaff, Ariz. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Select a plump fowl weighing four or five pounds, dress, 
singe and put on in boiling water enough to cover, let boil 
gently until it begins to grow tender. Save the broth with 
the giblets. Now cut the chicken into small pieces ; slice a 
quarter of a pound of fat pork into thin slices and fry it with 
the chicken until all is brown. Take up and stir into the pan 
in which they were cooked a tablespoonful of flour. Stir over 
the fire till brown and thick. Then add a pint of chicken 



292 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK 

broth, a teaspoonful of salt and quarter teaspoonful of 
pepper; pour gravy over chicken. Line a deep dish with rich 
puff paste and put in alternate layers of chicken, pork and 
sliced raw potatoes; pour in as much gravy as the dish will 
hold. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, and cover with a 
top crust. Bake three-quarters of an hour. Mrs. F. H. 
Waite, Winslow, Ariz. 

CHICKEX PIE. 

Dress, clean and cut up two fowl or chickens. Put a kettle 
on range with three pints of water ; as soon as water reaches 
the boiling-point, add chicken, a few pieces at a time, otherwise 
the boiling will be stopped, and the water thus cooled will draw 
out so much of the flavor that the chicken will become tasteless. 
When all is added, cover and cook slowly until meat is tender, 
adding one-half tablespoonful of salt during the last half-hour 
of the cooking. Remove chicken and discard skin and some of 
the larger bones. Strain stock, skim off fat and then cook until 
reduced to four cupfuls. Thicken with one-fourth of a cupful 
of butter mixed with one-third of a cupful of flour. Season 
with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken in serving-dish, strain 
over gravy, let stand over night and reheat for serving. Make 
a decorated cover of a rich pie crust. It is much better to bake 
the paste separately and reheat chicken before covering the pie, 
Contributed, Flagstaff, Ariz. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Cut up and boil till tender one large or two small one year 
old chickens with plenty of broth to cover it when done. Make 
a rich baking-powder biscuit dough, roll thin, line the sides of 
a deep four quart basin with the dough. Lay in the pieces of 
chicken, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and lumps of butter and 
drop in little pieces of the dough. Thicken the broth with a 
spoonful of flour, and turn in enough of this gravy to cover 
the chicken. Roll a piece of dough one-half inch thick and 
cover the pie, being careful to cut little holes in the cover for 
steam to escape. Be careful to wet the edge so the cover will 
stick, and bake one-half hour. Mrs. H. F. Adams, Williams, 
Ariz. 

PRESSED CHICKEX. 

Take two chickens and boil until tender enough to pick off, 
boil with one large onion and six little chiltipin peppers and 
boil also one sweetbread. After picked off put in a deep dish 
a layer of hard boiled eggs first, then a layer of chicken, then 
a layer of sweetbreads, then eggs, alternating. Leave the soup 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 293 

in the kettle and boil with one teaspoonful of gelatin and 
chicken bones for half an hour, then pour over mould and set 
aside for the night. The soup that is left mould in a cup and 
slice over the top of chicken. Serve this with mayonnaise 
sauce and browned crackers. Remove from the deep dish after 
it is moulded. 

Mayonnaise Sauce for Pressed Chicken. 

To make a mayonnaise perfectly and at the same time cer- 
tain that it does not curdle, add a few drops of lemon juice 
right at the beginning. To make a small quantity, use the 
yolk of an egg, half a teaspoonful of salt and some white 
pepper and the juice of half a large lemon or that of a whole 
lemon. Strain this juice. Mix the yolk and the seasoning, 
adding about three drops of lemon or so and a few. drops of 
oil, whisking briskly with a fork. Add more oil slowly, whisk- 
ing in a cupful of oil and every now and then add a little of the 
lemon. It should be thick, firm and still creamy. Acid a bit of 
rich cream when the mayonnaise is made. You can add to this 
which improves it, chopped green peppers, chopped pimentos, 
chopped pickled English walnuts, and a pinch of English mus- 
tard. Mrs. E. B. Perrin, Williams, Ariz. 

PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Boil two chickens until dropping to pieces, remove skin and 
bones, season with salt and pepper, add the liquor boiled down 
to a teacup or less. Put into a deep tin or mold, pressing well 
down. Let get perfectly cold and slice. Packing into baking 
powder cans makes pretty round slices. If a knuckle of veal 
is boiled with the chicken it will be solid and slice well. Mrs.

"An* what part .will yez have? Would yez loike some of the white?" 
Pat inquired of Mrs. O'Hooligan. 

"An" a leg will do me," she answered. 

As each one answered the part of the fowl she desired was given her. 

"What part will yez have, Moike Walsh?" Pat blindly inquired of his 
neighbor. 

"Oi belave Oi will take a leg, too," said Mike, in his most modest 
way, wishing to follow in the footsteps of the rest of the company. 

"Eegorra," said Pat to Mickey, "what does yez think Oi'm carvin 
a spider?" 

SMOTHERED CHICKEN.

CREAMED CHICKEN IN MACARONI MOULD. 

Cook the day before serving one-half package of macaroni 
in salted water until tender, do not break the pipes, wash off 
the paste in cold water by holding the dish under the cold water 
faucet, butter well any mould with a flat surface, arrange the 
macaroni first on the bottom, and then on the sides. Have 
ready two large cups of creamed chicken, hot and quite thick, 
place in center of mould till the dish is full. Bake half an hour 
in a pan of hot water in a hot oven, turn out on a hot platter, 
serve with a cream sauce sprinkled with rings of olives or Hor- 
net Mushrooms. 

WHOLE FOWL. 

Singe the chicken, turkey or duck, wipe inside and out with 
a damp cloth and dust with flour, pepper and salt ; then lay in 
the casserole and skewer to the breast four thin slices of fat 
salt pork. If stuffing is desired place it in the chicken just as 
you would if roasting in a pan. Set the breast-side down in 
the casserole and add the giblets, which consists of the liver, 
gizzard, heart and the neck, which should be chopped closely 
to the breast, leaving the neck skin attached so to bring over 
and securely covering the breast cavity ensuring the stuffing 
from oozing out. Truss the chicken neatly as it will be more 
easily cooked and carved. Cover and cook in a hot oven for 
fifteen minutes, counting from the time the fowl begins to 
cook ; then reduce the heat and cook until tender. An hour 
before this point arrives, skim off all surplus fat; then add 
quartered, pared potatoes, parboiled onions (small ones) to 
the casserole; cover and return to the oven to finish cooking. 
This resembles roasted chicken or turkey and the closely :ov- 
ered utensil keeps the flavor confined to the fowl. 

A Lucky Turkey. 

After having listened, at a Christmas dinner, to Jones' stale jokes, 
Smith said: "I say, Jones, the Christmas turkey is luckier than we 
are." 

Jones "In what way?"

meal. Stir well, so as to scald the meal; then mix three 
tablespoonfuls wheat flour with a pint of cold milk, stirring 
it gradually into the flour, so as to have it free from lumps. 
Turn it on to the Indian meal and mix the whole well together. 
When the whole is just lukewarm, beat three eggs with three 
tablespoonfuls sugar and stir into the pudding, with one tea- 
spoonfuls salt, two of cinnamon, or half a nutmeg, grated, and 
two tablespoonfuls butter, or suet, chopped fine. Add, if you 
wish the pudding very rich, a cupful seeded raisins, but they 
should not be put in until the pudding has baked five or six 
minutes. If .raisins are put in ,an additional cupful of milk will 
be required, as they absorb a great deal of moisture. A very 
good Indian pudding may be made without eggs, if a cup 
more meal is used and no flour. It takes three hours to bake 
an Indian pudding without eggs ; with eggs, it takes less time.

PUDDING SAUCES 



CHERRY PUDDING SAUCE. 

One cupful cherry juice, one cupful sugar, one cupful water, 
butter size of a walnut, one tablespoon cornstarch. Put the 
water in double boiler and when it becomes hot, add the 
creamed butter and sugar and the cherry juice; when scalding 
hot add the thickening. If too thick, thin with more cherry 
juice. Serve hot with whole or half cherries in the sauce. 
Mrs. Dermont, Williams, Ariz. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM SAUCE. 

Two tablespoon fuls pulverized sugar, one tablespoonful but- 
ter, one cupful sweet cream, two tablespoonfuls cocoa or choco- 
late, one teaspoonful cornstarch, four yolks of eggs, salt, va- 
nilla. Dissolve in double boiler sugar and chocolate, add 
cream gradually; let come near a boil, add the beaten yolks 
and starch, stir until it thickens more cornstarch may be 
necessary; take off the fire, add the butter, strain and flavor. 
Very nice with chopped nuts added. Contributed, Williams, 
Ariz. 

CREAMY SAUCE. 

One-fourth cup of butter, one-half cup of powdered sugar, 
one-half cupful of cream. Add one tablespoonful of vanilla or 
lemon. Cream butter and sugar well, then add cream. Beat 
well, and just before serving, place dish in a bowl of hot 
water and stir sauce until smooth and creamy, but not enough 
to melt the butter. When the cream is added, the sauce has a 
curdled appearance. This is removed by beating just enough 
to blend the materials thoroughly. It is not meant to be a hot 
sauce, and if it becomes oily in the heating, place on ice and beat 
until thick. Serve with hot pudding. Contributed, Saginaw, 
Mich. 

COLD CREAM SAUCE. 

Two cupfuls rich milk, two cupfuls heavy sweet whipped 
cream, four tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, one teaspoonful 
gelatine. Put in double boiler, milk and sugar ; let it become 
very hot, then add the dissolved gelatine, stir well, and when it

'fore it thickens add the whipped cream. This sauce may be 
used for many cold puddings, flavored with fruit juices, vanilla.

two tablespoonfuls lemon juice, one-fourth teaspoonful salt 
and one-eighth teaspoonful cayenne. 

WHIPPED CREAM SAUCE FOR DECORATING. 

To obtain a firm cream which can be used for ornamenting 
cold puddings with bag and tube, use double cream (or cream 
that is two days old). Prepare the cream some time before it 
is wanted ; put it in a basin and beat on ice, or in a cold place, 
with slow and even motion till the beater stands in the cream, 
or till it can be drawn to a point. Fast beating breaks the 
cream, makes it curdle and get weak; a pinch of salt added 
assists in giving better consistency to the cream. After the 
cream is beaten firm, put it on a sieve to drain for thirty 
minutes. To use it, beat into one quart of cream from four to 
six tablespoonful fine powdered sugar, add flour, and use with 
bag and tube. The puddings may be decorated in reverse

from canned fruits. The juice should be boiled down to a 
syrup, adding more sugar, and the juice of lemon ; or con-

no starch is required, because the syrup thickens sufficiently 
when cold. Pieces of fruits may be added.

ground nutmeg. Rub butter and sugar till smooth, but not 
creamy, and sprinkle nutmeg over it. Put in dish and set away

WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 355 

Mrs. Mary Leffingwell, Omes, O., asks : Can you tell me 
how to color mayonnaise dressing green? I know it can be 
done and, if the coloring material is harmless, I would like : o

few drops of lemon juice, strain through a piece of cheese 
cloth and add the juice to the mayonnaise. Or, you may use 
spinach leaves instead of parsley if you prefer. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING. 

Three tablespoons butter, two and one-half tablespoons flour,

SANDWICHES 



The first requisite in the preparation of good sandwiches is 
to have perfect bread in suitable condition. Either white, 
brown, rye or entire white bread may be used but it should be 
of close, even texture and at least, one day old. 

Spread butter smoothly on bread before it is cut, after 
cutting remove crusts if any. When ready to serve, cut 
sandwiches square, triangular, long, narrow, round, crescent, 
heart, diamond, or club shaped. Or, any preferred shape. 

In making rolled bread sandwiches, cut off the crust of a 
loaf of fresh bread and spread a thin layer of butter on one 
end of the loaf; cut off this buttered end in as thin slice as 
possible, and spread with your sandwich filling; roll up this 
slice and lay on a napkin; draw the napkin firmly around the 
rolled bread, and pin it. Put in a cool place until ready to 
serve, then remove napkin and tie sandwich with your color 
baby ribbon and any fancy fastening or fasten with toothpick. 

French rolls are often used for picnics or afternoon lunch- 
eons. Remove from the top of each cold roll, a piece of the 
crust the size of a silver dollar and take out the center with a 
spoon. Fill the space with highly seasoned chopped meat : 
fish, lobster or crab, replacing lid, wrap in tissue paper, and 
serve with pickles or olives. 

For very small, dainty sandwiches, the bread may be baked 
at home in one pound baking powder cans. These should be 
only half filled, and then allowed to rise before baking. You 
then have a round slice without crust. 

A garnish such as the following may be used : For meat 
and fish sandwiches, use sour pickles, olives, lettuce, water 
cress, parsley, mint or slices of lemon, and hard boiled eggs. 
For cheese sandwiches, use pickles, olives stuffed with celery 
or almonds. For sweet sandwiches, use lettuce, maiden hair 
fern, smilax, berries, flowers or candied fruits in fancy designs. 

To keep sandwiches fresh, if prepared an hour or two before 
serving, wring out a napkin in cold water, covering the tray 
and keep in a cool place. When taking sandwiches on a picnic, 
wrap tight in oil or wax paper. Eva Greene Fuller. 

FILLING FOR SANDWICHES. 

Good sandwiches are made by using a filling of chopped 
onions and cucumbers, mixed with mayonnaise dressing. Wal- 
nut meats, chopped and mixed with neufchatel or cream cheese, 



WILLIAMS PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 361

, SOUPS 



"Now good digestion wait on appetitie, and health on both." 
Shakespeare. 

The juice of meats is the greatest necessity for good stock 
and form the basis of all meat soups and of all principle sauces 
and dressings. 

Fresh uncooked beef, with the bones cracked, makes the 
best stock. 

Mutton, alone, is too strong in flavor for good stock, con- 
sequently vegetables and herbs seem necessary. 

Veal, too, needs something to help flavor and season. 

Chicken boiled alone makes excellent broth, but fowl and 
game must have the assistance of some other meat, vegetable 
or herb. 

For beef stock which is most generally used select a good 
fresh shin bone, having the bones thoroughly cracked. Put in 
a granite lined, tight covered, soup kettle, with more than 
enough cold water to cover it. Simmer slowly for several 
hours in order that the essence of the meat may be drawn out 
thoroughly. Skim off the scum frequently to prevent it from 
becoming turbid. Should more water -be needed at any time 
take from a boiling tea kettle. When the meat falls from the 
bones, it is cooked enough for ordinary soups and sauces. 
Remove from the fire, strain through a colander. If needed 
for bouillon, strain through a damp flannel cloth. Set away to 
cool: When cold remove all grease from the top, and set away 
for future use. 

For bouillon, take the very top of the stock jelly, re-heat, 
season and serve hot in bouillon cups. 

For consomme, this same kind of stock can be used, with the 
addition of vegetables and herbs. When the vegetables are 
thoroughly cooked, strain through a fine hair sieve. Season 
to taste and serve hot, with little cooked rice, barley or ver- 
micelli. 

A clear soup must be perfectly transparent, a thickened soup 
about like cream. 

BARLEY SOUP. 

Cook slowly one cup barley three hours. Have soup stock 
hot, add barley, salt, pepper and butter just before serving. 
Mrs. Lloyd, Sedro Woolley, Wash.

starch with three tablespoonfuls butter in a saucepan over the

VEGETABLES 



Captivated by order of the kitchen. 

Vegetables are the most useful accessory to our daily food 
and their cooking should receive attention. It is considered a 
simple thing to boil a pot of potatoes, yet their palatableness 
depend largely on the way it is done. Nearly all vegetables are 
much better put in boiling water, as the fine flavor is thus re- 
tained. Care should be taken not to overcook them, and should 
be served immediately. Potatoes should be pared very thin 
as the most nutritious part is next to the skin. Some vege- 
tables, as onions, cabbage, carrots and turnips, should be 
cooked in a great deal of water and when done immediately 
drained. 

A SUGGESTION AS TO VEGETABLES. 

Xot more than two kinds of vegetables should be served with 
a course. Lamb finds its appropriate accompaniment in pota- 
toes, peas, spinach or asparagus. Roast mutton calls for sal- 
sify, spinach, turnip, cauliflower or potatoes. Roast goose de- 
mands onions creamed, prune or chestnut stuffing or souffles, 
Hubbard squash, and apple sauce, of course. Roast beef affili- 
ates with carrots, cauliflower, onions, squash or string-beans. 
With fresh pork, apple sauce seems necessary. 

ARTICHOKES. 

Boil in salted water, completely covered, until tender. Keep 
hot. Serve individually with 

Hollandaise Sauce. 

One-half cup of butter, yolks of two eggs, juice of one-half 
lemon, one teaspoon salt, one-fourth saltspoon cayenne pepper, 
one cup boiling water. Rub the butter to a cream in a warm 
bowl with a wooden or silver spoon. Add the yolks one at a 
time and beat fast and well, then salt and pepper and one heap- 
ing teaspoon of sifted flour. About five minutes before serving 
add the boiling water. Place the bowl in a sauce pan of boiling 
water and stir rapidly until it thickens like boiled custard. Add 
the lemon juice with the water. Mrs. A. D. Wheeler, Man- 
istee, Mich. 

ARTICHOKES HEARTS. 

Heat the contents of one bottle or can of artichoke hearts, 
season with butter, pepper and salt. Cook until juice has 



390 THE ARIZONA COOK BOOK

sauce made as follows : Place in a saucepan on range, one 
chopped onion, three small chopped peppers, one bay leaf, two 
tablespoonfuls flour, two tablespoonfuls butter; moisten with 
one and one-half pints chicken or beef stock. Mix well. Add 
one-half teaspoonful grated horseradish, one-half teaspoon ful 
salt Cook twenty-five minutes or more ; strain. Beat yolks 
three eggs with juice of medium sized lemon. Then pour grad- 
ually into the sauce, being careful not to boil it again, after they 
have been added. Serve hot around the. artichoke hearts, with 
about five on each plate on toast. Mrs. Win. F. Dermont, 
Williams, Ariz.
