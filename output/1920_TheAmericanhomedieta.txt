PREFACE 

During the last twenty years steady progress has 
been made by various agencies in the Department of 
Agriculture and by the Home Economics Depart- 
ments in the States in introducing better methods of 
preparing and of preserving food in the home. One 
of the chief aims has been to teach the housewife how 
to select and prepare food so as to provide better 
nutrition for the family. While this work has been 
going on, scientific investigation has been making 
rapid progress in revealing the importance of several 
factors which were not appreciated a few years ago. 
As a result of this the character of the instruction in 
nutrition has necessarily undergone a decided change. 
The acquisition of numerous new facts relating to 
nutrition, which has come from experiments on 
animals, has greatly multiplied the detailed knowl- 
edge which the teacher of nutrition must master in 
order to be able to answer the many technical ques- 
tions relating to the subject. It has increased the 
complexity of the problem of inspecting the daily 
menu so as to make certain that it is adequate in all 
respects. On the other hand certain generalizations 
which increasing knowledge has warranted, make it 
possible to simplify the problem of the housewife in- 
stead of complicating it. 

It has been the aim of the authors to explain in 
non-technical language the reasons for the superior- 
ity of certain combinations of foods over others, and 
to offer convincing evidence that the regular use -of 
proper combinations of our common food-stuffs is the 
key-note to the successful feeding of the family. It 
is believed that an appreciation of the reasons why 
certain selections of food should be made, will be 
welcomed by intelligent housewives everywhere, be-

PART I 
Chapter I 

INTRODUCTION 

It is essential, in order to understand the technical 
details of the science of nutrition, that one should 
have an accurate knowledge of those divisions of 
physiology which relate to digestion and assimila- 
tion of food; an appreciation of the conditions within 
the alimentary tract which favor the growth of one ^*^**pÂ® "' 
or another type of bacteria, whose presence, accord- Nutrition 
ing to their race, may be beneficial or harmful; and 
an understanding of the chemistry of the substances 
which serve man as food and the changes which they 
undergo in the body. Such knowledge is not easy 
to acquire, and its scope is so great that it is not even 
possible to include all of it in the usual course of 
study leading to a college degree. It cannot be sim- 
plified very far without sacrificing in accuracy. It 
is not possible for all to become familiar with the 
technical aspects of the subject, and it is asking too 
much of the housewife to urge her to try to master 
the subject of nutrition. Nevertheless, she should 
understand the subject in its broad outlines, and 
should possess detailed knowledge of certain phases 
of it. The interests of the mother of a family extend 
beyond the supervision of its nutrition. They include 
its proper clothing, education and moral direction. 
Insofar as she can attain the desired results in their 
nutrition and reserve her time and energy for her 
other duties, an effort should be made to do so. Sci- 
ence must help her in this task. 

The farmer does not in general understand the 
chemical why and wherefore of the fertilizers which 
he uses. It is not probable that he would succeed 



The Farmer 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

any better if he had a far reaching knowledge of the 
several sciences which have contributed to the ad- 
vancement of agriculture. Science has taught him 
how to improve his animals through systematic selec- 
tion, for dairying, for meat, egg and wool production. 
It has shown him how to test his seeds, so that their 
Experiment P^wer to germinate is known before planting. Sci- 
Station encc has pointed out the importance of rotating crops 
rather than growing one crop year after year on the 
same plot. The agricultural experiment stations are 
making excellent farmers, by the process of instruct- 
ing them in what to do, without the detailed knowl- 
edge of the why. The farmer can dispense with tech- 
nical education which would be time consuming and 
expensive because he can ask questions of experts pro- 
vided by the state, and get a better answer than he 
could ever arrive at by means of his own limited 
opportunity for experiment and observation. 

The merchant needs to know quality in his goods, 
and to be able to judge their worth and how far he 
can recommend them. He would not in general suc- 
ceed better with a knowledge of the detailed tech- 
nique of their manufacture to make it worth while 
for him to seek this information. The housewife, 
the farmer and the merchant, and others, need 
certain knowledge which is directly applicable to 
their problems, and except as the acquisition of 
knowledge adds to the joy of living, an investment 
of efforts toward acquiring technical details relating 
in some remote way to their business would not be 
as advisable as the cultivation of an interest in some 
unrelated field of human endeavor. The latter course 
would in most cases afford more complete and benefi- 
cial recreation, and accordingly would be more advis- 
able. 

The mother of a family has a great multiplicity 
of duties, and one of her greatest needs is for an 

2 



The

opportunity to be free for a time each day to engage 
in activities which serve as a recreation. It cannot 
be denied that much of the education which she has 
been offered in nutrition has not only not simpHfied 
her problem, but has added to it. Is it practical or 
necessary to confront the housewife with tables giv- 
ing the fuel values and content of protein, fat and ^^^ ^^^^ 
carbohydrate in foods? Is it worth her while to learn Nutrition 
to visualize a hundred calorie portion of all of the of the 
common food-stuffs? Does not this complicate the Family 
whole problem of teaching her the essentials of nu- 
trition? Does it not defeat our end by making her 
feel that such things are impossible of application in 
her every-day routine? We all realize that the con- 
stant care, planning, timing and watching the prog- 
ress of cooking foods as well as attention to all the 
other duties of the household lay a great strain on 
the nervous system of the woman who conscientious- 
ly attends to them. There can be no doubt that 
women who are attempting to the best of their abili- 
ties to do for their families what the dictates of 
science demand would be greatly relieved if some 
system which would simplify their work instead of 
adding to it could be found. An effort to solve this 
problem, even though only partially successful, is 
desirable. 

Although there has been great activity during the 
past few years by various agencies in the work of 
educating the housewife in matters relating to nutri- 
tion, much of what has been written for her has not 
tended to save her labor, nor has it embodied the sources ^f 
new principles which have become firmly established, information 
Many agencies have set themselves up as authorities, for the 
and have filled newspapers and magazines and books Housewife 
with advice and directions in a confusing array. The 
Department of Agriculture has done a most valuable 
and commendable work in preparing and distributing

THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

literature for the education of the woman in the home, 
and its bulletins have always been written by experts 
in this held and were abreast of the times. The ex- 
Sources of tension workers of this department and in Universi 
" **^r^th" ^^^^ ^^^^ Colleges have accomplished an immense 
Housewife amount of good. There is no group of teachers who 
are more keen in keeping informed on the scientific 
literature, and they well deserve the confidence and 
patronage which they are receiving. The interpre- 
tation of the problems of nutrition found in these 
pages is essentially that now generally recognized by 
teachers. 

In the columns of newspapers and magazines de- 
voted to the home we see daily an unending series 
of new recipes for the preparation of novel dishes. 
This is a movment in the wrong direction. It tends 
to cultivate an unfortunate practice of seeking after 
^^^^ novelty in appearance of foods. It over-emphasizes 
mp asis ^j^g importance of attractiveness of service, and en-

Food to making fancy dishes, when her efforts could- be 
much better spent in other ways. Children who grow 
up to be accustomed to never ending variety in foods

who must do as well as her mother-in-law is said to 
have done in making things which are good to look 
at and to taste is frequently much closer tied to the

to ompute j-gturn to simplicity in diet for the relief of the house- 
wife, and for the good of their children. Any plan 
which urges the mother of the family to keep note 
of the calories consumed by her family should be 
discouraged, since it adds to her mental labors instead 
of affording relief. Satisfactory nutrition can be se-

cured for the family without this or the solution each 
day of a scientific problem in trying- to properly adjust 
the protein and energy intake to the individual needs 
of every member of the family. A movement in the 
direction of simplifying the v^^ork of the kitchen is 
much needed. 

It is true that in many institutions such as orphan- 
ages, prisons and asylums the inmates do not eat 
enough, either because they cannot get it, or because 
the quality is so unsatisfactory that the appetite fails. 
It is also true that even in good homes a child may 
fail to eat enough because of fatigue from lack of 
sufficient sleep, or because of excitement due to appre- 
hension that it will fail to reach school on time, or 
fail to prepare a lesson. Children who live so far 
from school as to make it barely possible for them to 
reach home, eat and return to the school house during 
the noon recess, cannot be expected to eat in the 
proper frame of mind, and doubtless in many cases 
such children do not eat enough. All children should 
be weighed at regular intervals, and any failure to 
increase in weight at the rate which is normal for 
their ages, should be regarded with alarm and all pos- 
sible causes inquired into and the actual cause re- 
moved when discovered. A satisfactory food supply 
and proper eating habits will not alone guarantee 
health. They must be supplemented with other good 
habits. Proper rest periods, proper exercise, good 
hygienic surroundings and peace of mind, each play 
an important role. 

The view has been accepted at the outset that 
while there is danger of over-eating by those with Appetite 
little judgment or self-respect, there is none that a Should 
normal person in health will fail to eat enough when Regulate 
food is available and presented in an attractive form, Quantity 
We can trust to the appetite to serve as a guide when 
the diet is properly made up to the amount of food 

5 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

which should be eaten. Those who work hara dur- 
ing the forenoon seldom fail to react at the dinner 
table with an appetite sufficient to insure their cover- 
ing a possible deficit of calories which might be ex- 
pected to follow a repetition of the same active work 
in the afternoon. Those who do not do manual work 
do not as a rule have the gigantic appetites of la- 
borers, and if they eat as do the latter, they ultimately 
sufifer from it. It is doubtful whether the housewife 
has ever restricted the food intake of her family by 
preparing for them the amounts of food which her 
mathematics and tables determine to be their indi- 
vidual needs. In the well regulated household there 
is always available some article to satisfy the appetite 
of a member of the family circle who may, because 
of unusual activity, want more than his usual amount 
of food. Why not take the appetite as a guide at the 
outset and ignore calculations of all kinds? 

Scientific research has fully demonstrated that the 
view which was universally accepted a few years ago, 
viz. that the protein and energy needs of the body 
are the two most fundamental factors in nutrition, 
is erroneous. In the older literature foods were se- 
EnergyNot jgcted solely on the basis of their chemical composi-

Factor of the feeding of an individual was with the stokmg 
of an engine. Standards were adopted for the pro- 
tein and energy requirements of the individual on the 
basis of age, sex and amount of work performed. This 
system remained in vogue for want of anything bet- 
ter. It was based on sound scientific facts, so far as 
it went, but these facts were of a nature which made 
them of little value for the immediate needs of the 
one who plans the daily diet. While data of this kind 
still remains of great usefulness in the estimation of 
large purchases of food for groups of persons, the 
family group is so small that suitable amounts of 

6 



WHAT SHALL, WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

food can easily be estimated with the eye by the ex- 
perienced purchaser. This system did not, we now 
know, take into account all the factors which must 
be considered in the choice of food, but it had other 
defects as well. 

Chief among these defects was the view that the 
woman who plans the meals must keep rigidly in 
mind several matters such as the special needs of overweight** 
different members of the family group, the working 
man; the sedentary man, his fatness or leanness; the 
child in school; the aunt with a tendency to over 
weight; and grandfather who is getting old. Such a 
demand on a housekeeper who has all the usual 
household cares on her mind defeats its own end, and 
after an excursion into the literature of nutrition 
she usually reverts to the old and well tried method 
of providing the things which experience has taught 
her her family likes, and she gives them as much as 
they want. 

We have failed to find any evidence either in ani- 
mal experimentation or in human experience to war- 
rant the belief that there is. any essential difference 
in the character of the diet which will best support 
well-being in persons of different ages. It is true that 
certain foods which are not suited to the delicate 
digestive tract of the infant or young child can be 
safely taken by an adult. It is by no means certain, 
however, that the adult will be well nourished and his 
vitality maintained at a high level by diets which 
are unsuited to the child of four or five years. In- 
deed, there are strong reasons for believing that such Adult's Diet 
diets as maintain normal growth and. vigor in chil- p^.^^^^^^ 
dren past infancy are physiologically superior to any Growth in 
which would not fulfill these requirements. There the Young 
is no satisfactory evidence that the character of the 
diet should be changed when growth is completed. 
It is advisable, in order to make use of certain foods 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET. OR

in Nutrition 



which can be produced economically, for the adult 
portion of the population to use to some extent foods 
which are not suitable for infants or young children, 
for it seems that this can be done without detrimental 
effects by following very simple rules for combining 
them so as to make good each others deficiencies. 

The mother of a growing family has it in her 
power to educate them according to their capacity to 
become normal human beings. Young children 
should be restrained from incessant eating, and the 
same restraint should be continued during the adoles- 
cent period when the boy or girl, overflowing with 
animal spirits, and active in out-door activities, would 
frequently, if left to their own choice, take food at 
any time it is available. In the schools, as well as in 
the home, children should be taught what kind of a 
diet best promotes health, and the dangers to health 
and happiness in later life which follows the violation 
of the laws of nutrition. Failure to develop a normal 
appetite for wholesome foods at meal time as the 
result of taking all but worthless soft drinks and con- 



fections, and of 



eating 



candy regularly between 



meals, may be reflected in any abnormal craving for 
more of the articles which delight because of their 
appearance, taste and odor, when in reality it is a 
sign of abnormality due to faulty nutrition. If the 
effects of such transgressions were more prompt and 
more severe, their seriousness would be more often 
appreciated by parents. Unfortunately their effects. 
are slow and cumulative, and their future menace 
seems too remote to exert much corrective influence. 

The central idea in the system of diet provided 
by the menus for the entire year which are presented 
in this book is that it is possible to substitute for the 
type of instruction which has been given in the past to 
the housewife, and which requires her to learn some- 
thing new and difficult, a plan which saves her the 

8 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

task of continually exercising ingenuity in planning 
succeeding meals. At the same time it assures her 
that the diet presented to her family at every meal central idea 
time complies with all the requirements of physiology of the Plan 
so far as our present knowledge makes possible. The 
almost universal tendency to constipation and its 
debilitating effects have been kept constantly in mind, 
and the menus regularly contain articles which tend 
to correct it. The amounts of meats served will fall 
decidedly below that common in many households, 
and the cheaper cuts have been introduced as far as 
seemed consistent with the serving of attractive food. 
There has been a distinct effort made to make the 
flesh foods go as far as possible in conferring palata- 
bility on vegetable foods, and a more liberal use of 
milk is assured than is common in the average Amer- 
ican home by the regular introduction of milk into 
cookery. This in itself cannot fail to improve mark- 
edly the quality of the diet over what is now in daily 
use almost universally in this country. In addition 
it may be claimed for the menus presented that they 
are of such a nature as to satisfy the appetite of any- 
one whose esthetic demands for food are not over 
fasti-dious. At the same time they are not so tempt- 
ing as to encourage over eating. 

Foreign and meaningless names of dishes have 
not been used, and this we believe requires no apology ^^ Foreign 
or defense. The spirit of Americanism has grown Â®^"** 
greatly in recent years, and it is time that it should be 
reflected in the household books on diet. 

Since the object is to simplify the work of feeding 
the family throughout the year so as best to promote 
its health, and at the same time to give the housewife 
as much respite as possible from the kitchen, very few 
dishes are included which require great expenditure 
of time or labor. Simplicity of service has also been 
kept in mind with the same end in view. To the

woman who finds her greatest pleasure in life in set- 
ting an artistic table, and who really likes to spend 
much time in making fancy dishes, this idea may not

of Service fi'om it tor recreation and self miprovement, a plan 
for efficiency in her business, and shorter hours of 
work cannot fail to be welcome. 

It was deemed inadvisable to enter into a discus- 
sion of the diet of the sick. Rather, it is aimed to 
prevent disorders of metabolism which result from 
violation of physiological laws by preventing errors 
in diet. A simple discussion of the common elements 
of danger in the handling of food of infants, and well 
established facts concerning why food should be prop- 
erly handled, is included because an understanding 
of these matters should be a part of the stock of 
knowledge of every mother. A discussion in non- 
technical language of the properties of each of the 
more important foods, and the requirements which 
must be met in human nutrition, is included in order 
to give the housewife an appreciation of the theory 
on which the diets which she serves are formulated. 
This cannot fail to add interest in her work.

Chapter II. 

THE RELATION OF THE DIET TO HEALTH 

The span of human life has been nearly doubled 
during the last century and a half because of the 
operation of several factors. Living conditions have 
been improved through sanitation; water and milk 
supplies have been rendered nearly safe; the fly nui- xendTto 
sance abated, and thereby typhoid fever greatly re- prolong 
duced ; mosquito control has eradicated yellow^ fever Life 
and has in certain localities greatly reduced malaria. 
Preventive medicine has worked wonders in produc- 
ing immunity against several diseases, and progress 
in this direction is still being made. 

Much, however, remains to be accomplished in 
alleviating the sufferings of mankind. The mortality 
records show a marked decline in the power of Amer- 
ican workers to withstand certain influences in mod- 
ern life. This is manifested in an extraordinary in- 
crease in the death rate from breaking down of the 
heart, hardening of the arteries, the development of 
diseases of the kidneys and an increase in nervous 
and digestive disorders. 

These diseases are developing in younger people 
Avith each succeeding decade, and now reach down 
into middle life, and are increasing in people of all 
ages. They are old age diseases, and yet among the ^,. . 
410,000 people who die annually from them, 60,000 Djseast^s 
die under the age of forty years ; 105,000 die between 
the ages of forty and sixty years, and 245,000 die 
above the age of sixty. Tuberculosis causes every 
year about one-tenth of the total death rate, and little 
if anything has been accomplished in reducing its 
prevalence. There is no better treatment for this 
disease than rest, fresh, clean, cold air, and good feed- 

11 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET. OR 

ing. The recovery of thousands under this regime 
attests its value. There is little doubt that bad living 
conditions and especially the adherence to a diet of 
poor quality, lowers the vitality and renders people 
susceptible to the disease, and is in great measure 
responsible for its wide spread occurrence. 

Not only is the span of life shortened by these old 
age diseases, but the productive period of life and 
the capacity of the individual are reduced. Accidents, 
damaged products and ruined machinery, as well as 
physical discomfort and mental suffering, are the 
price which society is paying for living in such a way 
as to foster the early degeneration of the body tissues 
and consequently early loss of youth. They are the 
causes of inaccuracy, lack of efficiency and lack of 
success. The records show that the mortality from 
these old age diseases has increased nearly one hun- 
dred per cent, in thirty years. There can no longer 
be any doubt that faulty nutrition is one of the most 
important factors contributing to this condition. 

Early aging is manifested not only in the ways 
just mentioned, but is reflected in the character of 
much of the advertising matter in our newspapers and 
periodicals. There is no more promptly appearing 
Early sign of poor nutrition than loss of the normal texture 
Aging ^j^(j quality of the skin. The numerous expensive 
spaces devoted to describing the virtues of facial 
soaps, beauty lotions and skin foods, reveal the profit 
arising from an appreciation by manufacturers of the 
extent to which the women of America today are ob- 
serving in their mirrors skins which have lost the 
quality seen in the faces of well nourished school girls 
in the primary grades. It is further reflected in the 
elaborate displays of hair of shades characteristic of 
youth in the windows of every city; in the scores of 
different remedies for constipation: in cures for bald- 

13 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

ness, and in the financial success of magazines de- 
voted to physical culture. 

These and other causes for uneasiness to so large 
a portion of our population reveal the need for a full 
appreciation of the kind of habits of life which wrill 
conserve better than we are now conserving the buoy- 
ancy of childhood and adolescence, which but occa- 
sionally remain long with either men or women after 
growth is completed. It is time to present to our 
children, in practical form, the best advice possible 
in the light of modern nutrition studies, concerning 
how to live so as to promote health and vigor, and to 
preserve as long as possible the characteristics of 
youth. One of the most important means of pre- 
venting the deterioration of the body is through 
proper nutrition. 

Poor physical condition is by no means restricted 
to recent years in this country, nor is it necessarily 
due to modern conditions of city living. Many will 
recall how our grandmothers insisted on the frequent Faulty 
treatments with sulphur and molasses ; the periodical jsrot^New* 
dosing with bitters, and the efficacy of sassafras 
tea in the spring as a means of "thinning the blood", 
which was supposed to become impure and thick 
during the winter. Among our pioneer ancestors 
the idea was generally accepted that there was a 
need for a spring medicine of some kind. There Former 
can be little doubt that this belief rested on common ^^^ spring 
experience. We know that in the early settlement Medicines 
of many of the states the people suffered great hard- 
ships. With little capital and no food reserve, their 
winter diet was generally very simple and monot- 
onous, and there is good reason to believe 
that it was chemically unsatisfactory for the main- 
tenance of health. After a period of several months 
during each succeeding winter they felt "run down,"

and when spring came the prevalence of "that tired 
feeHng" which the ahnanacs which were circulated 
by patent medicine concerns made such profitable use 
of in convincing people that they needed a course of 
The treatment with sarsaparilla or a "spring tonic" or 
Restricted q^-j^^j- "blood purifier," was so universal that it estab- 

Winter . . . 

Diet lished the belief that winter was an unhealthful sea- 
son. If one now investigates the same communities 
where a few years ago this condition was regularly 
observed, one finds prosperous farms, well supplied 
with dairy heads, orchards and all the signs of mod- 
erate prosperity. There is much less pronounced 
difference between the winter and summer diet, for 
these reasons and because of the abundance of canned 
fruits and vegetables put up at home or easily pro- 
curable from the grocery stores. These changes 
have caused the disappearance of the tired feeling in 
the spring (or better, at the end of winter), and 
consequently the need for spring medicines. 

The vendor of spring medicines had a powerful 
ally in the spring diet of his customers. With the 
coming of warm weather various "greens" were avail- 
Effects ^t)^e ^"<^^ were eagerly sought after. Sorrel pies, wild 
of the onions and dandelions came from the prairies and 
Spring were added promptly to the food supply. The cows, 
^^Â®t which because of their starved condition had been dry 
all winter, became fresh and milk was available. The 
few hens in the barnyard added worms, insects and 
tender grass to their diet and began to lay eggs. The 
garden came on and fresh vegetables were abundant 
and were eaten with a relish which can be appreciated 
only by one who has for a period been semi-starved. 
The tired feeling disappeared about this time, but the 
regular spring remedies had been taken, and the 
beneficial results of better diet were wrongly attrib- 
uted to the efficacy of drugs.

The diet of rat No. 1 consisted from weaning time 
of bolted wheat fiour 20, degerminated cornmeal 10, 
cooked and dried potato 30, peas 10, navy beans 10, 
beets 5, turnips 5, and cooked and dried beefsteak 10 
per cent. 

When photographed it was 308 days old. The 
life of the domestic rat is about 3 years, and this 
animal corresponded approximately in age to a man 




of 28 or 30 years. Note the small size, thin hair, and 
general old and miserable appearance. This diet 
afforded wide variety, has an appropriate chemical 
composition insofar as analysis could show, was pal- 
atable, and included only natural food products of 
recognized wholesomeness, and from both animal and 
vegetable sources. Notwithstanding these facts the 
nutrition of a group of animals restricted to this food 
supply was very faulty. 

Rat No. 2 was the same age as the one above, and 
had been fed on the same diet from weaning time, 

15 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

except for one modification; its diet consisted of 
bolted wheat flour 20, degerminated cornmeal 10, po- 
tato 24, peas 8, navy beans 8, turnips 5, beets 5, beef- 
steak 10, and dry whole milk (Merrill-Soule Com- 
pany) 10 per cent. 

The addition of milk to the diet of rat No. 2 shown 
in the picture made the difference which is illustrated 
by the photographs. The one which received the 




milk was youthful, vigorous, and much larger than 
the one receiving the same food without it. 

It is only within the last four or five years that 

anyone could say what constitutes a satisfactory diet, 

New ^ut we now know definitely that the regular diet of 

Knowledge a large portion of the people of the United States is

Our knowledge of nutrition has been gained wholly 

by experiments on animals. The information thus 

gained has enabled us to study the quality of the

WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

dietaries used by man in a manner which would 
otherwise have been impossible. The effects of dif- 
ferent kinds of diets on man can best be understood 
by an illustration of the effects of certain combina- 
tions of foods on animals. 

It has been found impossible to nourish laboratory 
animals satisfactorily on any diet which is derived 
entirely from cereals (wheat, oats, corn, rice) and 
other seeds; tubers such as the potato, edible roots 
such as sweet potato, turnip or beet, together with 
meats which are derived from the muscle tissue of r^^y^^^^ 
animals (ham, steak, etc.). Even when fed a diet Roots and 
containing wheat flour, corn meal, peas, beans, po- Meats Not 
tato, turnip, beet and round steak, young animals Sufficient 
have always failed to grow to more than two-thirds 
of their normal adult size, and they grew more slowly 
than they were capable of growing. They produced 
but few if any young, and almost never succeeded 
in keeping the few which they have produced alive 
through the nursing period. Before animals which 
were fed on this diet were more than a quarter 
through the normal span of life of well fed individ- 
uals, they were rough looking and thin haired. The 
skin was rough and dry, and they had all the appear- 
ances of extreme old age and were ready to die by 
the time they were a third through the span of life 
normal to the species. 

The same diet with a liberal supply of milk add- 
ed produced a remarkable contrast in a similar group 
of animals fed at the same time. This is well illus- 
trated by the appearance of one of the animals from 
each group. (See pp. 15-16) The above described diet ^^^.\!^^^^ 
of cereals, peas, beans, tubers, roots and meat is also ^^^^j Green 
remarkably improved by the addition of such leaves vegetables 
as celery tops, spinach, cabbage, turnip tops and 
other green vegetables. It is obvious from these re- 
sults that there is some remarkable difference be- 

17 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

tween the dietary properties of leaves or of milk as 
contrasted with any of the ordinary seeds, tubers, 
roots and lean meat which are so commonly used as 
food for man and animals. By appropriate experi- 
ments it has been possible to determine wherein this 
superiority of milk and leaf lies. 

It has been learned that the proteins of the cereals 
and of beans and peas, tubers and edible roots are of 
rather poor quality because they do not yield suffi- 
cient amounts of certain of the simple digestion 
products which are formed in the stomach and intes- 
Proteins tine. Thesc digestion products are the building 
Have Little stones of which the muscle tissues are made during 
Value growth. Unless the right kinds with respect to size 
and shape are furnished by the food proteins the exact 
pattern on which the muscle must be constructed 
cannot be formed, and in this case growth is inter- 
fered with. 

It has long been known that several mineral ele- 
ments such as those in common salt, lime, phosphorus, 
iron, etc., must be furnished by the food. It was not 
appreciated until recently, however, that many of 
our commonest food-stuffs do not contain enough of 
Mineral certain of these, especially lime, to meet the require- 
Saits Very i-i-iej-,|^s Qf ^ rapidly growing young animal. Seeds, 
mpor an ^^^j^^^-^^ roots and lean meat are all poor in lime, and 
the milling products of wheat, corn and rice are also 
very poor in iron and phosphorus. Animals have 
been found to be surprisingly sensitive to a shortage 
of any one of the mineral elements which are indis- 
pensible, and are seriously injured if allowed to go 
with too small a supply. 

During the last few years it has been discovered 
that there are three substances of remarkable interest 
which the diet must supply, which were not suspected 
to exist until recently. They are remarkable in the 
fact that but a surprisingly small amount of each is 

18 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

necessary to meet the needs of an animal, but even 

the small amounts which cannot be dispensed with 

are not present in many foods. One of these will 

not take the place of another. All must be supplied. Newly 

When one or another of these three substances is pp''Â®*^*'**^

absent from the diet, or is furnished in inadequate Essentials 
amount, there results a peculiar disease. There are 
three of them, and they have come to be called "de- 
ficiency diseases." Each is the result of the lack of 
a single substance. These interesting food units have 
been given an unfortunate number of names. They 
have been called vitamines, accessory food sub- 
stances, fat-soluble A, water-soluble B, water-soluble 
C, etc. No less than twenty-five variations in the 
nomenclature of the three have come to the attention 
of the authors. A brief account of the so-called defi- 
ciency diseases follows. 

SCURVY. This is a disease due to faulty diet. 
It has ceased to be common in recent times, and 
is now met with chiefly in babies who are 
not properly fed. Occasional cases are met 
among Arctic explorers, and the disease is 
common among prospectors in Alaska. It was 
very common among sailors in the 16th and 17th F^uit 
centuries, because of the very poor quality of the diet r"*^^^^" 
which was furnished them on ship-board. Scurvy is vegetables 
l)revented, and when not too far advanced can be Prevent 
cured by eating fresh vegetables generally. Orange Scurvy 
juice, lime juice and lemon juice, fresh cabbage, raw 
potato, onions and tomatoes enjoy the special repu- 
tation of being of exceptional value in the prevention 
and cure of the disease. Scurvy is a very serious 
disease. The teeth become loose and the gums 
spongy. The latter bleed easily and the capillary 
blood vessels in the skin on various parts of the body 
rupture and cause hemorrhages in spots. The patient 
suffers great pain and weakness. The disease is liable 

19 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

to develop in anyone who lives. for several months 
exclusively on cooked, canned and dried foods, no 
matter how abundant the diet or the extent of its 
variety. This is illustrated by the serious outbreak 
among the British troops in Mesopotamia in the great 
war. 

Scurvy is easily prevented by the inclusion in the 
diet of moderate amounts of fresh, unheated fruits or 
vegetables, or by using raw milk. Considering the 
number of people who derive almost all their food 
supply from wheat flour, corn meal, rolled oats. 
Diets Which breakfast cereals, beans, peas, potatoes and meats. 
Produce all of which have been thoroughly heated, it seems 
Scurvy j-^ther remarkable that this disease is not more com- 
mon than it is. It seems probable that many people 
come very close to the minimum intake of the pro- 
tective substance for scurvy (the antiscorbutic sub- 
stance) which allows them to escape having the dis- 
ease by a narrow margin. The above list of foods 
may be supplemented by canned milk, cooked cab- 
bage, butter or butter substitute, molasses, prunes, 
raisins, canned fruits, cheese, macaroni, crackers and 
canned foods of almost any description, and yet the 
diet will contain so little of the antiscorbutic sub- 
stance that a person who adheres to it for several 
weeks or months will be in danger of developing 
scurvy, although he may just escape. The occasional 
outbreak of this disease in garrisons, prisons and be- 
sieged armies illustrates this fact. Those who will 
take the trouble to learn how very great a part of 
the total food supply of many employed persons is 
derived from the list of foods just given; foods which 
the grocer can handle without danger of loss because 
they are marketed in a nearly non-perishable condi- 
tion, must realize how narrow is the margin of safety 
against scurvy in such cases. The purchase of some 
fruit such as apples, pears, peaches, oranges, bananas 

20 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

to be taken raw, or the use of raw tomatoes, lettuce, 
celery, nuts, etc., in salads, cabbage to be eaten as 
cold slaw, cantaloupe, etc., is economy in the interest 
of health. They serve a specific purpose which is 
important because of our modern food habits. 

XEROPHTHALMIA (Pronounced ze-rof-thal- 
mia) of a certain type is an eye disease due to faulty 
diet. The substance which protects against it is not ^^ 
abundant in any of our ordinary foods except in but- Disease 
ter and egg yolk. It is associated with the fats in caused by 
these foods, but strange to say it does not occur in Faulty 
any of the vegetable fats or oils. It is less abundant ^*Â®^ 
in the leaves of plants, but is found nowhere else 
among our ordinary food-stuflfs in sufficient amounts 
to meet the needs of either a growing child or an 
adult. 

In this deficiency disease the eyes become in- 
flamed, the lids swollen, even to an extent which 
prevents their being opened. The coats of the eyeball 
frequently rupture, and the contents of the eye are Butter, 
expelled. Blindness will result in a short time if the ^^t^^i^" 
diet is wholly lacking in the protective substance. It 
is relieved in its early stages in a very spectacular 
manner by feeding butter, cream, egg yolk, such 
glandular organs of animals as liver and kidney, and 
likewise by the liberal use of leafy vegetables. Al- 
though this disease has not been at all common in 
this country, at least fifteen hundred cases have been 
observed in Japan, and sixty in Denmark. In Japan 
the diet of the children consisted too largely of cereal 
foods, and in Denmark the trouble was confined to 
infants and young children who were fed exclusively 
on separator skimmed milk. Many of these children 
promptly recovered when given whole milk, or cream 
mixtures. Blindness due to malnutrition appears to 
have resulted frequently among children in some 
parts of Europe devasted by the war. 

21 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

Several reports are to be found in the medical 
literature of a condition called night-blindness, which 
afflicts men living in lumber camps and elsev^here 
v^hose diets are limited to a short list of foods such 
as wheat flour, beans, meat, tea and coffee, with only 
occasionally other additions. This condition is com- 
Night mon in Newfoundland, where a large part of the sea- 
Blindness faring population restrict themselves to the simple 
diet just mentioned. It seems highly probable that 
this condition represents the beginning of the disease 
which we are discussing. The common remedy for 
it in lumber camps is drinking of milk or the con- 
sumption of cheese. This new discovery in nutrition 
emphasizes the importance of including dairy prod- 
ucts in the diet. Milk is the cheapest and most effi- 
cient food for supplying the substance which protects 
against this type of malnutrition. 

BERI-BERI is a deficiency disease which occurs 
widely distributed over the world. It occurs most 
frequently in the Orient, especially among the poorer 
classes whose diet is very simple and monotonous. 
Beri-beri It afflicts especially those who eat polished rice as 
the chief cereal, and who make the remainder of their 
diet largely fish or meat. It is common in Laborador 
and Newfoundland and among people who eat little 
else than wheat bread made from bolted flour, fish 
and salt meats, tea, and occasionally duff with raisins. 
The disease is common in South America among 
natives and groups of laborers who are fed by their 
employers principally on staple, non-perishable cereal 
products and meat. 

The principal manifestation of beri-beri is a gen- 
eral paralysis. Animal experimentation has demon- 
strated that the only foods which are entirely lacking 
in the substance which protects against this type of 
malnutrition are polished rice, starch, sugar, glucose 
and the fats and oils from both animal and vegetable 

22 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

sources. Bolted wheat flour, degerminated corn 
meal, certain breakfast cereals, macaroni, spaghetti, 
tapioca, hominy made by the present commercial 
process, steak, ham and other cuts of meat which 
come from muscle tissue, fish and fowl muscle, are 
all very poor sources of the substance which protects 
against this disease. Ordinary cooking, or heating 
sufficient to preserve foods in canning does not great- 
ly decrease their value with respect to this protective 
substance. Beans, peas, raw and cooked vegetables 
of all kinds, milk, eggs and fruits are all good sources 
of this food complex. 

It should be emphasized that the faulty character 
of the various articles mentioned above in connection 
with the prevention or cure of any of the deficiency 
diseases, does not indicate that these are not good 
and wholesome foods, and does not indicate that they Safe to Use 
should not enter into the diet of man as they have Faulty Foods 
done in the past. These foods which are deficient in J?^^'^^^^. 
one or another respect, form our staple articles of ^.j^^^^^ 
diet. Many of them are among our most important 
agricultural crops and we should continue to make 
use of them freely. The thing to be kept in mind is 
that nearly all of our common foods are deficient in 
some degree in one or more respects, but that the 
shortcomings are not the same in different classes of 
foods, so that by using suitable combinations which 
supplement each other in the proper manner, highly 
satisfactory diets can be secured. 

We should avoid the use of diets which, while not 
sufficiently faulty to produce a condition which can 
be recognized as a breakdown of the type of one or 
another of the so-called deficiency diseases, may yet 
be so faulty as to bring the individual into a state of 
chronic nutritional instability. There can be no doubt 
that such a condition is common at the present time, 
and in providing a list of menus for the entire year,

such as is listed in later pages of this book, the object 
is to do away with such a danger. Avoidance of 
error in the selection of foods which will properly 
supplement each other so as to insure good nutrition, 
demands a somewhat extensive knowledge of the

with respect to each of the several dietary factors

ever, become familiar to every housewife. Even if 
she possessed it, in order to be successful she should 
have to give a degree of attention to the planning of 
each meal which would be a burdensome task. 

RICKETS appears not to be a deficiency disease 
in the same sense that scurvy, xerophthalmia and 
beri-beri are, but it is directly the result of faulty nu- 
trition in young children. Starvation for lime salts is 
one of the predisposing factors, but a poorly consti- 
tuted diet aggravates the tendency toward the devel- 
opment of this distressing condition. Faulty bone

son of escaping acute digestive disturbances which 
may be caused by dirty milk. The disturbances of 
digestive function so frequently caused by unclean 
food, weaken the child and interfere with its nutri- 
tion to an extent w^hich turns the balance against it.

Chapter III. 

The Relation of Faulty Nutrition To Early Loss 

Of Youth 

It is possible for man to live exclusively on a diet 
of flesh, and indeed the Eskimo subsists almost ex- 
clusively on food of animal origin. He could not live 
on steak and ham as his sole food supply however. 
The secret of his success, such as it is, lies in the use 
of blood, bone marrov^, the glandular organs and the Tissues 
soft bones of frozen fish, along with muscle tissue Alone 
and a large amount of fat. Studies on laboratory 
animals have clearly established the fact that only 
by such dietary habits can the carnivorous diet suc- 
ceed, but while such a food supply may sustain life, 
it is not satisfactory in promoting good nutrition. 
It is characteristic of all exclusive flesh eaters, both 
men and animals, that they are active, aggressive 
and persevering only when hungry. When they have 
been fed they become lethargic and dull. Dr. Gren- 
fell says in his book on Labrador, that the Eskimo 
will not catch one fish while a white fisherman will 
catch ten. 

It is now definitely established that there are but 
two kinds of diets suitable for people in regions 
where agriculture is possible, which are satisfactory 
for the maintenance of health and vigor over a long 
period, viz. : those which contain either milk or the 
leafy vegetables in suitable amounts. (*) Since there 
are certain deficiencies from the dietary standpoint 
in all seeds, tubers, roots and lean meats, and it is 
necessary to add to any assortment of these, either 
milk or the leaf of some plant, in order to make them

Protective extent eggs may also be regarded as a protective food, 
Foods ^^^ ^^g.^ ^^^ ^^^ g^ good a source of lime. 

In the light of such experimental data obtained 
v^ith animals it is interesting to note that a menu 
of veal cutlets, boiled or baked potatoes, buttered 
peas, gelatin salad, bread, butter or a substitute for 
it, mince pie and coffee, would be recognized by the 
average family as a satisfactory dinner. This menu 
is derived entirely from a meat representing muscle 
tissue; a tuber, potato; a legume seed, pea; gelatin, 
a protein from meat or bone; a cereal, bread; meat 
and fruit from which mince meat is prepared and a fat, 
butter or a substitute made from animal or vegetable 
fats. Such a diet cannot be regarded as satisfactory 
for the maintenance of health, although it complies 
with the older standards of chemical composition 
Faulty which wcrc supposed to be adequate as a basis of 
Menus judgment. We now know that it is necessary to 
ommon ^^^i^^ ^^j. selection of foods from certain sources, as 
well as to be sure that the diet contains enough of all 
the substances which we know how to estimate chemi- 
cally, in order to have it complete. It is a simple mat- 
ter to modify the above menu so as to greatly improve 
its value. If breaded cutlets (dressed with egg and 
bread crumbs), mashed potatoes to which milk is 
added, creamed peas, gelatin salad, bread and butter 
and caramel custard are substituted, the meal would 
not differ appreciably in attractiveness and palata- 
bility from the former, yet it would be decidedly 
superior to it for the maintenance of health. 

It is well known to those who have inquired into 
the matter, that there are thousands of American 
families who are using little or no milk, and who eat 
practically no green vegetable other than an oc- 
casional serving of cabbage. We in America have 

26 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

developed a system of diet which is fairly good in by 
far the greater number of homes throughout the land, 
because nearly or quite enough milk and its products 
are used. In most instances, however, the diet would no^ Enough 
be further improved by the use of more milk, and MUk is 
nearly every family in the land is taking far less green Used 
vegetables than it should. In many of the large cities 
the consumption of milk per person averages less than 
a pint a day. Since all children in families where 
intelligent care is given them are furnished about a 
pint and a half or more each per day, and a consider- 
able number of adults in good homes take a similar 
amount, it must be true that many homes use little or 
no milk regularly. Direct inquiry has shown this to 
be the case. 

Green vegetables, generally speaking, are very ex- 
pensive, as are also fruits. To some extent the ex- 
cellent dehydrated products now available could be 
used to great advantage and doubtless will be as soon 
as the public learns how highly the processes of 
dehydration, with the preservation of the appetizing 
qualities of the fresh articles, have been perfected. 
At present fruits are eaten but sparingly in many ^eafy 
households because of their cost. They are highly jj^^^ 
desirable for the reasons which have been discussed. Remarkable 
It is certain that the food supply now commonly used Value 
in thousands of households would not support any 
species of animal in a state of health over a very great 
fraction of its span of life. There is much direct evi- 
dence that such diets as are now common do not 
maintain health and vigor in adult human beings, 
much less do they lead to normal development in a 
growing child. 

In considering the effects of a diet which is more 
or less faulty, but of sufficiently good quality to pre- 
vent its evil effects from becoming promptly notice- 
able, we must take into account the life history of the 

27 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR

individual. In experimental animals it is found that 
such diets as do not contain the protective foods lead 
to early aging and short life, and that the life is 
ordinarily terminated by diseases such as tuberculosis 
or pneumonia. The animals may appear to be in 
fairly good condition for wrecks or months, according 
to the length of life of which the species is capable, 
but their lives are terminated at a quarter, a third or 
a half of the span which they might reach if they were 
well nourished. A period of debility precedes death, 
and when the vitality reaches a certain low level they 
become the prey of infections which carry them off. 
The effects of faulty diet are present before they can 
be recognized by any outward sign. Nervousness 
and irritability are many times the first noticeable 
symptoms, and following these the poor condition of 
the skin and hair attract attention. In all these re- 
spects we have the counterparts in man. 

A typical life history of an individual may be some- 
what as follows : In infancy it is nursed for a short 
time, but because the mother does not have an ade- 
quate milk supply or on account of the inconvenience 
of nursing, the child is placed on bottle feeding. For 
a time it thrives on cow's milk, but is accidently given 
a bottle of stale or dirty milk, which causes an at- 
tack of indigestion followed by diarrhea. A physician 
takes it off of a milk diet, substituting a cereal water 
for a few days, then gradually replaces the latter by 
milk and the infant begins to grow again and is ap- 
parently normal. The milk is, however, frequently 
not clean and fresh, and the baby suffers more or less 
from indigestion, is fretful and does not get enough 
rest and sleep because of its discomfort, and accord- 
ingly does not grow as fast as it should for consider- 
able periods. Its delicate digestive apparatus is more 
or less debihtated by irritation from unwholesome 
decomposition caused by the action of certain kinds 

28 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 



of bacteria which should never have been allowed to 
enter it. Its capacity to digest and absorb food is 
lowered, and the child may suffer from a slight attack 
of rickets which result in its legs being somewhat 
crooked in later life. As it grows older and is given 
eggs and fruit and cereal with its milk it develops 
better, but is always somewhat under weight, a little 
pale and not so energetic as it should be. When just 
out of infancy many children are allowed to eat meat, 
and too much sugar or syrup. Sometimes, because of 
being given milk which is stale and bad flavored they 
form a distaste for it, and are allowed to go without 
it. No effort is made to cultivate a liking for spinach, 
cabbage or other green leafy vegetables, and the re- 
sult of one or all of these abuses is an under nourished 
child. 

After passing out of infancy the child may be 
allowed to continue the faulty eating habits just de- 
scribed, and in addition, to eat between meals and 
so spoil its appetite when it comes to the table. Meats 
and sweets are eaten entirely too freely, and the re- 
mainder of the diet may consist largely of bread and 
butter and potatoes. Such eating habits fail to make 
the child develop normally at a time when the perm- 
anant teeth are forming, and the foundation of life- 
long dental troubles are laid. We have become so 
accustomed to see children whose physical develop- 
ment is distinctly below what it should be that as a 
rule parents do not feel a sense of guilt for a condition 
in their children which is wholly the result of their 
own neglect of duty. To be sure it is the result of 
ignorance, or indifference, but the outcome of their 
failure to meet their obligation is, nevertheless, a life- 
long tragedy for their offspring. 

The housing together of a large number of chil- 
dren in the schools exposes them to colds, and all the 
common children's diseases, and makes it practically

certain that all will have measles, whooping-cough, 
chicken-pox, mumps, and repeated colds of a con- 
tagious nature. These could be greatly reduced if 
greater attention were given to preventing the at- 
tendance of school by sick children, but at present 
there seems little hope of greatly reducing this men- 
ace to the health of the child. All diseases are a 
menace to future health, and add to the probability 
that the tonsils may become infected, or that catarrhal 
conditions of the nose and throat may become estab- 
lished, or that tuberculosis may be contracted. 
Sleeping in closed rooms and lack of fresh air and 
exercise during the winter months all tend to debil- 
itate the child, and to render it less capable in later 
life than it might have been. 

In the better class of American homes a sufficient 
amount of milk, eggs and ice cream, and of fruits and 
vegetables are used to make it possible for children 
to grow up to what appears to the average observer 
a fairly normal physical condition, because our stan- 
dards of what constitutes normality are low. Such 
standards are in general what we are accustomed to, 
rather than standards based on a careful considera- 
tion of what can be realized. It is high time that 
every mother should know as much about feeding her 
family as the thousands of successful farmers now 
know about feeding live-stock. In the barnyard the 
money factor has been sufficient to cause reform, but 
too many mothers are giving a large amount of 
thought and time as well as labor to solving the 
problem of dressing themselves and their children 
attractively, while leaving their physical development 
entirely to chance. Physical vigor is the fundamental 
basis of health, enjoyment, achievement and long life, 
and every consideration should be subordinated to 
securing it.

WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

At the period of life between fifteen and thirty 
years of age, most people enjoy their best health. The 
powers of resistance and the capacity to digest food 
are greatest at this time. Freedom from illness and 
the ability to recover promptly from the effects of loss 
of sleep or of fatigue foster the idea that various 
violations of the laws of hygiene and nutrition are 
matters of little importance. Young people over eat 
of any palatable food and eat at irregular intervals, 
with so little evidence of any unfavorable effects that 
they see no reason for giving any thought to habits 
of right living. But as all persons advanced in years 
know, this happy freedom from accountability for 
violation of the laws of health does not last many 
years in most cases. 

Most people past thirty begin to realize that they 
cannot do certain things without discomfort, which 
formerly they did not notice. The man of thirty to 
forty years who is engaged in some occupation which 
affords little opportunity for exercise in the open air 
generally becomes aware that his digestion is not so 
good as it once was, and that he does not have his 
former energy. For years meat, bread and potatoes 
have formed the bulk of his diet, other things being 
secondary and irregular additions. Meat is good and Many Lose 
he has eaten it freely and regularly. At first he at- too^Ear/v***^ 
tributes his failure to dispose of his food as he 
formerly did solely to lack of exercise, and he begins 
to walk to his work or at least part of the way, when 
formerly he rode. His physical condition is on his 
mind more or less daily, and he talks to an acquaint- 
ance with whom he falls into company on his way to 
work, about how he is walking to keep himself fit. 
This change does benefit him, but there is still some- 
thing wrong with his feelings and digestion, and he 
begins to eat more sparingly. This seems for a time 
to be all that is necessary to keep him in a state of

well-being. But his hair grows thinner, until an un- 
mistakable bald spot appears. His skin shows 
wrinkles. If his ancestors were fat his waist measure 
increases ; if they were thin he grows more shadowy, 
and if his digestion is more impaired, assumes the 
mien of the dyspeptic. In either case he thinks daily 
of his physical condition, and there is a growing 
tendency for him to keep conscious of the manner in 
which his digestive apparatus is disposing of its last 
installment of food. He notices that little things ir- 
ritate him, which formerly he would not have ob- 
served. He would not admit that his health is failing, 
yet he takes up golf, or cultivates a garden because 
he feels better as a result. Months or even years may 
go by with little noticeable change in his condition. 
Yet the tendency to introspection is there, and at 
forty-five he seeks additional life insurance, and to his 
surprise is refused. 

He now begins to take notice of the "How to keep 
well" advice in the newspaper, and peruses the adver- 
tisements of books on health. His future course de- 
pends in great measure on the kind of literature on 
diet which he reads. He may try thorough mastica- 
tion, which someone recommends as a panacea for all 
ailments due to faulty nutrition. He chews each 
morsel until his deglutition mechanism automatically 
snatches it from his control. He announces that this 
new discovery benefits him greatly, but nevertheless, 
quietly discontinues the practice after a time. 

He may learn from his reading that a low protein 
. diet makes for health and efficiency, and that the best

depend on the frequent use of cathartics for rehef 
from constipation. 

There are other systems of diet which men or 
women in the condition so common in middle Hfe 
may adopt in seeking relief from discomfort and fail- 
ing powers. Vegetarianism; the fruit and nut diet; 
the adoption of whole wheat bread instead of white is^^and^"' 
flour bread; the two meal a day regime; lacto-vege- other 
tarianism and sour milk therapy, are examples. All Systems 
work a change for the better for a time when the of Diet 
subject before had been a hearty meat eater, and had 
adhered largely to the meat, bread and potato type 
of diet. Of these lacto-vegetarianism, or the use of 
a vegetable diet along with milk and eggs is, in the 
light of modern knowledge, decidedly superior for 
the promotion of health to any of the others. It is 
especially good when liberal amounts (as much as 
a quart a day per person) of milk and of green leafy 
vegetables are used. " 

In order to appreciate how so many different die- 
tary practices may all lead to partial relief from the 
sense of ill-being which the middle aged person so 
frequently feels as the result of taking for years a 
diet not satisfactorily selected and rich in meat, it 
is necessary to understand the general behavior of 
the digestive tract, and how faulty habits lead to 
its debility. 

In the intestine of the young infant, when it is 
in a healthy condition, and is nursed by its mother, 
there is no putrefaction with the formation of the 
unwholesome decomposition products of proteins so 
common in the adult. The sugar of milk is peculiar- 
ly suited to serve as the carbohydrate supply in the 
nutrition of the infant, because it is not fermented 
readily. Cane sugar leads to gas formation in many 
cases because it is so readily fermented. Milk sugar 
encourages the development of a variety of bacteria 

33 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

in the intestine, which forms small amounts of lactic 
acid. This keeps the condition in the digestive tract 
acid and tends greatly to keep down the putrefactive 
Putrefaction organisms. When an infant is fed stale milk, or other 
t^stin* food not suited to it, and an attack of indigestion 
follows, the intestine is usually seeded with bacteria 
of forms which are dangerous to health. It is then 
placed in a very disadvantageous position with re- 
spect to its nutrition. The diarrheal discharges show 
by their odor that they are full of foul products. The 
highly irritating nature of these is apparent from 
the manner in which the skin of the buttocks is red- 
dened and inflamed by coming into contact with them. 
It may not be doubted that the irritation of the lining 
membrane of the intestine, which is more delicate 
than the skin, is even greater than the latter. 

Aside from the injury to the lining membrane of 
the intestine, the child is burdened with the intoxi- 
cation which results from absorption of the poisons.

oiT physically as if the infection had never happened: 
There can be but one answer to this question: No. 
An injury of this kind leaves permanent effects on 
all the tissues of the body. The intestinal wall is 
never quite so capable of protecting itself against in- 
vasion by bacteria in later life as it would have been 
if it had never been subjected to the injury. During 
such attacks the liver and kidneys are bathed with 
blood which contains poisonous substances, and they 
are ever afterward a little less capable of performing 
their vital functions than they would otherwise have 
been. The results of illness are cumulative, and the 
oftener illness is repeated the less vigorous will be 
the body's defensive power. The lowered vitality 
caused by one infection increases the liability to some 
other infection. Influenza prepares the body for

pneumonia. Small-pox does not itself take the life 
of its victim, but it makes possible the invasion of 
the tissues by a streptococcus which does. Measles 
are very frequently followed by infections to which, 
previous to the attack, the body was immune. 

Nearly all children who are not nursed in infancy 
suffer from one or more attacks of intestinal infec- 
tions which lay the foundation of ill health in later 
life. Once the digestive tract of the infant is seeded 
with pernicious types of organisms by feeding it 
dirty milk, it never returns to a condition where the 
intestine is as clean and hygienic as it was before.

Many children both in infancy and childhood are Disad- 
allowed to suffer from constipation more or less reg- vantage 
ularly. This neglect in many cases lays the founda- 
tion of lifelong suffering. Irritation of the intestine 
always results from long contact with decomposing 
fecal matter. The habit of emptying the bowel but 
once a day is regarded by medical men everywhere 
as an artificially established practice which produces 
bad effects on health. It schools the intestine to har- 
bor its contents without protest, and destroys its 
capacity to functionate. The seriousness of this mat- Evil 
ter will be appreciated by almost everyone from per- Effects of 
sonal experience, and from the knowledge that the *^"* *^^ ***" 
habit of taking cathartics is an all but universal prac- 
tice among adults. Cathartics act because they irri- 
tate, and they steadily work damage on the intestine. 
Another factor in establishing chronic indigestion 
and malnutrition is the habit of eating at stated times 
irrespective of the need of food. The active and the Overeating 
sedentary sit down to eat at the same time, and the 
interval between meals is adjusted to the needs of 
the former. The prevalence of double chins and 

35 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

triple necks attests the fact that many are eating far 
more than their actual food requirements. Unfor- 
tunately the appetite is not a safe protector, especially 
when tempted by attractive dishes, and many eat 
when the digestive tract is not prepared to handle 
food. The term digestive tract is used intentionally, 
because of the widespread misapprehension as to the 
scat of the trouble in indigestion. Discomfort which 
is referred to the stomach is in most cases the mani- 
festation of abnormal conditions in the intestine. 

When food or drink is taken into the stomach the 
contractions which are set up in swallowing tend to 
continue throughout the entire length of the alimen- 
Muscuiar ^"^^y ^^'^^^- Inimediatclv after eating is, therefore, a 
Activity favorable time to reinforce these contractions which 
of the tend to grow more feeble as they pass away from the 
Intestine stomacli. A couscious effort at this time will gen- 
erally lead to the large intestine emptying itself. It 
is possible to train the intestine so as to have a con- 
siderable amount of control over it. Nearly everyone 
ignores this opportunity and allows it to pass. The 
result is that the intestine is forced to harbor decom- 
posing food residues which keep it in an unhygienic 
state for many hours longer than is necessary. 

In a well person there is a prompt response by the 
stomach with secretion of a digestive juice which is 
strongly acid when food is taken, even though there

the meal. The response is much less vigorous, how- 
ever, than it is when there is a genuine desire for 
food. In the confirmed dyspeptic or the neurasthenic, 
there may be no such response, and food may lie for 
a long time in the stomacli without digestion, and in 
a condition favorable to bacterial growth. Gas may 
be formed and cause discomfort, or the food may

undergoing bacteriological decomposition. In other 

36 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

cases, stomach digestion may be nearly normal, and 
the growth of bacteria develop only after the partly 
digested material has reached the lower intestine. 

Dr. Alvarez has recently reported very interesting 
studies which show that in many instances of pro- 
fuse gas production and its regurgitation, the gas 
does not form in the stomach, but in the lower intes- perUitaUic 
tine. The intestine reverses the direction of its run- Action 
ning waves of contraction so as to bring the contents 
of the lower bowel back toward the stomach. This 
condition arises when there is an irritating mass in 
the lower intestine. Hie regurgitation of gas, and 
the contents of the intestine causes nausea and belch- 
ing. Bile is forced from the intestine back into the 
stomach, and some of it comes up with the gas, caus- 
ing the bitter taste. This condition is a typical "bil- 
ious attack." It is not due to sluggishness of the 
liver as is popularly supposed, but to an abnormal 
nervous reaction which reverses the direction in 
which the intestine moves its contents. Its inciting 
cause is an unhygienic condition of the intestine. 

During profuse gas formation in tlie intestine, 
loops are filled so tightly as to form kinks which pre- 
vent its escape, and this results in pain. The tension 
may reach a point which seriously interferes with the 
circulation of blood through the intestinal wall. The '"J"^y 
wall sometimes becomes so inflamed that the outer intestine 
surface becomes pasty and may adhere to adjacent by Food 
parts forming permanent adhesions. The surgeon Decompo- 
frequently sees such adhesions in his operations. '*'**^" 
They greatly interfere with the action of the intes- 
tine and hurry the patient on toward invalidism. 

The weight of the fecal matter in the intestine 
is frequently so great as to cause a sagging out of 
normal position, because the tone of the abused mus- 
cles is lost. Prolonged distension of the stomach or 
intestine sometimes causes permanent dilitation and

partial loss of function. Pressure of the distended 
stomach on the heart frequently leads people to be- 
lieve that they have heart trouble. 

Chronic indigestion causes the cultivation of the 
habit of centering the attention of the sufferer on the 
manner in which his digestive apparatus is disposing 
of its last meal. All impulses which are transmitted 
from the brain to the digestive tract have, unfor- 
tunately, a tendency to depress its normal muscular 
activity, and its secretion and absorption. It is a 
common saying that a well person never knows that 
he has a heart or a stomach. There are outlying sta- 
tions of the nervous system called ganglia, whose 
business it is to take care of the secretion and mus- 
cular activity of the alimentary tract automatically, 
and thinking of one's digestion profoundly interferes 
with their functioning. It is a grave mistake to keep 
thinking of how digestion is proceeding, in the fear 
that some morsel which has been eaten may not agree 
with one. The wholesome effects of pleasant company 
during meals helps to keep the brain from interfer- 
ing with normal digestion. 

Such a habit of self observation often leads one to 
try to establish which article in his last meal is re- 
sponsible for his misery. He lays the blame on one 
and decides that it does not agree with him and avoids 
it in future. As one attack of indigestion follows 
another, he gradually eliminates one food after an- 
other as dangerous to him. In time he forgets earlier 
experiences and eats without distress foods which 
had been under ban, and gradually goes the rounds 
of condemning a series of perfectly wholesome foods. 

The conditions described represent the extremes, 
but are no more serious than thousands which are 
regularly observed by the medical profession. For- 
tunate are they who are protected from infancy from 
debilitating influences in nutrition and who adhere 

38 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

to a type of diet which approximates the optimum, 
and is of such a character as to discourage over-eat- 
ing. 

There are many adults, however, who have been 
well brought up, and reach middle life with good 
vigor, but who fall into the practice of taking too 
much of their food in the form of meat, bread, pota- 
toes and sugar. These and other articles made from 
wheat flour, as macaroni, crackers, etc. ; other seed gread and 
products, such as peas, beans, rice and oats, make up potato Type 
altogether too large a share of the total food supply of Diet is 
and are not supplemented with a suftici.ent amount of Faulty 
milk, eggs and the green, leafy vegetables to correct 
their deficiencies. The result is that while they have 
enough to eat, its quality is poor, and the blood 
stream is nearly always more or less impoverished 
with respect to one or more substances which are in- 
dispensable to complete the list necessary for the nor- 
mal nutrition of the tissues of the body. Animals 
confined to such diets grow old rapidly even when 
the diet is of a composition which satisfies the food 
chemist, but is not so selected as to contain a suffi- 
cient amount of the protective foods. It seems neces- 
sary to interpret the rapid increase in the develop- 
ment of the so-called old age diseases, hardening of 
the arteries, kidney and heart degeneration, during 
the last thirty years, as in great measure the outcome 
of changed dietary habits, whose significance would 
never have become appreciated but for animal experi- 
mentation. 

Professor Folin of Harvard University has shown 
in a very interesting way the degree to which by 
middle life the kidneys of the normal man or woman 
lose their capacity to perform their function of elim- 
inating the waste products of metabolism into the 
urine. He has refined methods for the analysis of 
the normal constituents of the urine, so as to be able 

39 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

to determine their amounts in very small samples of 
the blood. An examination of the amounts of these

impairment lating in the blood of healthy young medical students,

the latter were carrying about thirty per cent more

creted by the kidneys into the urine. There appears 
to be in many apparently normal persons, a progres- 
sive decrease in the capacity of the kidneys to carry 
on their work of freeing the blood of waste products. 
The lesson which we should learn from such facts is 
the imperative need of taking from infancy up such 
a diet as will defer the onset of the changes charac- 
teristic of aging.

Major McKay has reported extensive observations 
on the nutrition of the natives of India, which afford 
a remarkable confirmation of the fact that the prin- 
ciples of diet outlined here are correct, and apply to 
human nutrition. Among the numerous peoples of 
India there are found groups who differ most widely 
in their dietary habits either from force of circum- 
stances or from religious motives. In the crowded 
districts of Bengal, where there are about nine hun- 
dred people to the square mile, the natives are largely 
grain eaters, rice being the principal cereal. Other 

40 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

vegetable food is eaten so far as it is available, and 
animal food is craved but the supply is inadequate. 
The physical condition of the Bengalese is almost 
without exception miserably poor. In the eastern dis- ^^^ ^^Â®^ 
tricts of Bengal, where the diet is largely confined ^^^Tthe 
to cereals, beans and fish, the physical condition of Hindus 
the natives is better than among the more nearly 
strict vegetarians. They are, however, still very in- 
ferior to the hill tribes of Tibet and other people who 
keep fiocks and herds and use large amounts of milk 
in addition to vegetable foods and meat. Those who 
would attribute this difference in development to cli- 
mate must explain why the Arabs who live so largely 
on soured milk of camels, mares or cows, have from 
time immemorial, while living in a climate where in 
summer the temperature daily reaches a hundred de- 
grees or higher, had both the physical power and the 
courage to journey over the long and wearying car- 
avan routes of the deserts. 

While the data furnished by Major McKay is not 
so complete as is desirable, it points definitely to the 
conclusion that a cereal and meat diet, even when it 
furnishes considerable variety, falls short of the 
value which it would have if dairy products were 
added in liberal amounts. 

It is significant that the reports of British officers Experience 
to their government on the fitness of the natives of with Indian 
the several parts of India for military service show Soldiers 
that the vegetarian Bengalese are regarded as_unfit, 
and they are no longer used for recruiting the native 
army. The pastoral tribes, who use large amounts 
of milk regularly in their diet, are commended in the 
highest terms, as respects their physical fitness, cour- 
age and moral standards. 

The children of Bengal are described by McKay 
as poor, miserable, pot-bellied little creatures with

tribes are well developed and happy-looking. 

Dr. Goldberger and his associates in the U. S. 
Public Health Service have made elaborate studies 
of the diets of the people of certain parts of the South 
where a disease known as pellagra is common. This 
distressing malady, which was not recognized until 
1908, now afiflicts about 170,000 people. It seems 
almost certain that it is a contagious disease, but that 
faulty diet is the chief predisposing cause. The well 
fed do not have it. Those who live during the win- 
ter on a food supply limited essentially to bolted 
wheat flour, degerminated corn meal, polished rice, 
starch, sugar, molasses and fat pork, and take little 
or no milk or leafy vegetables, furnish the victims 
of this dreaded disease in the spring when their vi- 
tality is low. Such a diet seems to make them sus- 
ceptible to infection. Good feeding with a diet in 
which milk, eggs and green vegetables are abundant 
will cure those who have pellagra in its early stages. 
An extensive survey of the diets of pellagrous and 
non-pellagrous households in three villages in North 
Carolina showed that the greater the extent to which 
milk entered into the food supply, the less was the 
incidence of pellagra. 

From the foregoing considerations we may safely 
conclude that there is a very real need for a better 
selection of food than is now practiced in many house- 
holds in America and elsewhere. It is not sufficient 
that we secure enough protein and energy to cover 
the body's requirements. There are several factors 
of great importance for the promotion of vitality and 
health which may not be left to chance in the plan- 
ning of the family diet.

THE DIETARY PROPERTIES OF THE MORE 
IMPORTANT AMERICAN FOOD-STUFFS 

In the preceding chapter it was pointed out that 
diets may be derived from both animal and vegetable 
foods, and afford considerable variety, and still fail 
to induce good nutrition unless they are properly se- 
"Projective lected. Diets derived solely from w^heat flour, corn 
meal, rice, rolled oats, potatoes, sweet potatoes, rad- 
ish, turnip, beet, and the lean muscle meats, all taken 
together, will prove inadequate. It is true that growth 
may take place on such diets, and apparent health 
may be enjoyed for a certain period, but they fall 
short of the optimum quality after which we should 
strive. Only those diets which contain one, or prefer- 
ably both, of the protective foods, milk and the leafy 
vegetables, have ever maintained animals in a state 
of nutrition which promotes vigor and preserves the 
appearance of youth and sustains longevity. In the 
present chapter the most important human foods are 
discussed with respect to their dietary properties, 
and their special qualities made clear, in order that 
it may be appreciated why certain combinations of 
foods make good each others deficiencies. 

THE CEREAL GRAINS. The most important 
food grain in Europe and America is wheat. Its most 
important use is as a bread grain, because when 
mixed with water, wheat flour forms a better dough 
than can be obtained with flour from rye, barley or 
Wheat buckwheat. The custom of eating as a part of every 
meal the spongy white bread made from bolted flour 
has a very strong hold upon us. All will remember 
the little hardship of giving up white bread for war 
breads for patriotic reasons. 

44 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

The flour which was sold before the war, and to 
which the millers promptly returned as soon as re- 
strictions were removed, contains about seventy- 
three per cent of the entire wheat kernel. The parts 
discarded in milling are used as stock feeds. Bran 
is the outer layer of the grain. Middlings, or shorts, 
contain fine particles of bran and some flour which white Flour 
adheres to them through the milling process. The 
germ of the seed is also separated in milling, but is 
afterwards mixed with the jiiiddlings because there 
has never been established a market for this very rich 
fat and protein-containing portion. The white flour 
which is used as human food is the part of the grain 
which breaks readily into particles sufficiently fine to 
pass through bolting cloth. 

The modern milling process differs markedly from 
the old process in use when milling was a local indus- 
try, and people who lived in the vicinity of the mill 
brought their grain and took home the flour. MiUing 
in earHer times consisted in grinding the grains and 
sifting out the coarse particles of bran, but the mod- 
ern process is carried out with machinery which does 
not grind. Instead, the kernels are passed between 
rollers which break them by impact. This method 
of breaking the grains does not tear the bran or the 
germ. Because of the large size of the bran particles. Modem 
or skin of the kernel, they are easily screened out. Milling 
The germ consists of a group of cells which in the 
unbroken seed are capable of developing into a new 
plantlet. It contains much oil, sugar and protein, and 
is suf^ciently plastic to escape being reduced to fine 
particles in the process of breaking to which the 
wheat grain is subjected in the roller mill. Since the 
germ remains intact it is, like the bran, easily re- 
moved from the flour. White flour represents the 
part of the kernel which is very rich in starch and 
gluten (protein) and which crushes so readily under

the blows of the rollers as to make its particles fine 
enough to pass through bolting cloth, hence the name 
bolted flour. 

There are great differences in the nutritive value 
of the proteins of the different parts of the wheat 
kernel. The proteins of the germ are of better qual- 
ity than those of other parts, but the germ is not 
suitable for human food because the oil seems to have 
slightly detrimental properties. Bran is not a good 
human food because it is too coarse and irritating 
to the digestive tract. The proteins of bolted flour 
are among the poorer proteins which enter into the 
diet of man. This does not constitute a sufficient 
reason for regarding flour as an inferior food, because 
when used in proper combinations with other foods 
the proteins of the flour are supplemented so as to 
greatly enhance their value. 

Our attachment to light bread made from bolted 
flour is based on habit. We have been schooled from 
infancy to the regular use of a light, leavened bread, 
and the trade has cultivated a demand for perfectly 
white flour for purely commercial reasons. Whole 
wheat flour does not make so attractive a loaf as does 
White Bread bolted flour, but there is just as little reason for our 
basis o'f judgment as to what is attractive in bread 
as there is for our standards as to what constitutes 
beauty in dress. Both are based entirely on custom. 

Bran is now widely employed as a remedy for the 
correction of constipation. Its action depends on its 
irritating nature, and on the greatly increased bulk 
which it confers on the residues of food which escape 
Bran absorption in the intestine. It cannot be denied that 
much relief is experienced by many persons from 
taking bran, but the same object can be attained by 
an extension of the use of such vegetables as spinach, 
cabbage and other related plants, also turnips, beets, 
radishes, onions, carrots, etc., and the latter are to 

46 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

be recommended rather than bran, because they are 
less irritating, and possess valuable food properties 
in addition. 

Not only is bolted flour a source of proteins of 
poor quality, but it is very poor in those mineral 
elements which are essential constituents of the nor- 
mal diet. The most important deficiency in this re- Quality of

what short of containing enough of the protective Diseases" 
substance without which the eye disease, xerophthal- 
mia develops. 

Bread is, therefore, a very incomplete food. It 
is, notwithstanding its shortcomings, a good food 
provided it is combined with the proper food-stuffs 
to make it complete, and the^ statements made to its 
discredit are not to be construed as a justification for 
seeking some substitute for it. Wheat is one of our 
best agricultural crops and we should continue to use 
it freely, but with a full understanding of what should 
be eaten with it. 

It is logical to ask the question why the poorest 
part of the wheat kernel is placed on the market as 
human food. The question has been frequently dis- 
cussed and usually without a full appreciation of all 
the factors which are involved. Whole wheat flour

The reason for the manufacture of bolted flour is 

purely a commercial one. The unbroken wheat kernel 

can be kept for a long period without undergoing 

changes which affect its food value, but when it is 

milled, either by the old grinding process or by the 

more complex roller mill process, it soon undergoes 

changes which make it less palatable. The fats in

demonstrated by anyone by a simple experiment. 
If some bolted flour is placed in a container, and 
some fresh wheat germ in another, and the two are 
loosely covered and kept in a warm room ,for a few 
weeks, the germ will be found to be alive with insects, 
while the flour will be almost free from them. The 
insects which infest cereals place their eggs almost 
entirely in the germ, and this part most closely ap- 
proximates a complete food for the larvae. 

All flour is now milled in a few centers princi- 
pallyl near the wheat growing regions. The by- 
products are used as stock foods in those regions 
with but short shipping radius. The flour must ac- 
cordingly be shipped long distances in many cases, 
and a comparatively long period must elapse between 
its manufacture and consumption. Up to 1917 the 
average period between milling and marketing to the 
consumer was about six months. Some flour is in

it is greatly to his advantage to handle a product ^eiV ^*^* 
which can be marketed without commercial hazard. 
Hence the perfection of milling machinery which ef- 
fectively separates both germ and bran. 

There are several competing interests in the mill- 
ing industry, and their most effective appeal to the 
housewife is the whiteness of the flour. We naturally 
associate whiteness with purity in flour, as with gar- 
ments, walls and furniture; hence arose the practice 
of bleaching flour which is not naturally as white as 
was desired. There is no justification for the demand 
for white flour by the public. It has been created The 
artificially for commercial reasons. whiteness 

â¢' of Flour 

It is not easy to prepare so light and attractive a 
loaf of bread from flour which contains a higher frac- 
tion of the entire kernel than the 73 per cent now 
usually converted into flour. Whole wheat flour has 
a distinct flavor not possessed by the bolted product. White Flour 
but its use in baking requires special skill which must Lighter 
be acquired. Loaf 

It is not probable that whole wheat flour will ever 
become widely used for the reasons just stated. There 
seems to be no good reason why the use of white flour 
should be discouraged. The present practice in mill- 
ing returns over a quarter of the grain to the farm 
as cattle feed, and avoids danger of loss in the dis- 
tribution of that part which is used for human con- 
sumption. The important fact to be appreciated is 
not the difference in the food value of whole wheat 
and ordinary flour, a difference which is decidedly Whole 
in favor of the former, but that the entire wheat ker- ^Xow: 
nel is itself not a complete food. Many of our nat- 
ural foods are incomplete, even when not manipulated 

49 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

or changed in any way. The watchword of modern 
scientific nutrition is proper selection of foods and 
their consumption in the most desirable combina- 
tions. 

CORN OR MAIZE. This is the second seed grain 
in importance in the United States. It is very popu- 
lar in the Southern states as a bread grain and is used 
more or less widely in other parts of the country. 
The meal which results from its milling does not 
make a dough when mixed w4th water, and therefore 
Corn Bread a leavened bread cannot be made from it. When 
properly made corn bread is highly attractive to those 
who are accustomed to it, but like new foods in gen- 
eral, it does not appeal to those who have not learned 
to like it. The French and English did not like it 
during the war when they were forced to use it, but 
this was in a great measure due to their lack of knowl- 
edge of how to use corn. 

The dietary properties of corn are closely similar 
to those of wheat. The difference in the appeal to 
The the palate is due entirely to differences in physical 
Dietary properties. Fifty years ago corn, like wheat, was 
of Corn "billed by grinding in small local mills, and the re- 
sulting meal contained the entire kernel. In order 
to meet modern commercial demands it has become 
necessary to produce a meal which will not change 
flavor w^ith aging, and will not favor the development 
of weevils in warm weather. This can best be ac- 
complished by the removal of the germ, and accord- 
ingly machinery has been perfected which accom- 
plishes this. The germ is sold as hominy feed for 
stock, and the cornmeal retailed for human consump- 
tion is a degerminated product. The oil is extracted 
from the germ and is used for various technical pur- 

50 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

poses and is now sold in retail packages as a salad 
oil. The proteins and mineral content as well as the 
energy value of corn meal correspond very closely 
with the corresponding values for wheat flour. 

THE OAT. The oat kernel is largely used as a 
breakfast food, and to a lesser extent for making 
cookies and for other purposes. It is sold almost 
exclusively in the form of rolled oats, and differs 
considerably from wheat and corn in its chemical TheOat 
composition. It contains nearly a third more protein kernel 
than either of these and about 8 per cent of fat; the 
content of the latter in corn and wheat being about 
2.1 and 5.0 per cent respectively. The quality of the 
proteins of the oat are about the same as those of 
the other cereals, and it contains no dietary proper- 
ties which serve to distinguish it greatly from any 
of these. Up to very recently it was not found pos- 
sible to remove the germ from the oat, but the desire 
to improve its keeping qualities has led to the per- 
fection of a machine which turns the husked kernel 
end over end on a rough surface, thus etching away 
the germ which is exposed on one end. 

RICE â This cereal forms the most prominent 
article of diet of more than half of the human race, 
but its use is largely confined to Asia and the islands 
of the Pacific. It has never found great favor in the Rice 
United States, although it is widely used everywhere 
as an occasional addition to the bill of fare. We 
prefer the potato instead of rice as our main starchy 
food other than wheat bread. Those who are 
brought up on rice like it better than potatoes or 
wheat bread. 

In many places where rice is grown it is eaten 
without polishing, but when it is to be transported it 
is almost always polished, primarily for the purpose Unpolished 
of improving its keeping qualities. This is ac- ^^^^ 
complished by friction of the kernels against each 

51 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

other. In polishing, the bran layer and the germ are 
both removed and the grain is made lighter in color. 
Polished rice is poorer in protein, mineral elements 
and fat, than any other of the cereal grains. 

Since the dietary deficiencies of polished rice have 
been poin 2d out repeatedly in popular literature in 
recent years, some manufacturers have made an effort 
to counteract public suspicion of the value of their 
product in a w^ay w^hich is calculated to decive. Just 
as it has become generally known that bolted wheat 
flour is not so complete as whole wheat, so it has be- 
come common knowledge that during polishing some 
of the valuable parts of the rice kernel are lost. This 
has attracted much attention because people who eat 
unpolished rice do not develop the disease beri-beri, 
while those who live largely on polished rice may do 
and White ^Â°- ^^ order to ofTsct the suspicions regarding the 
Rice market product, a so-called brown rice has been ad- 
vertised and substituted for white rice on the market. 

In order to intensify the whiteness of polished rice 
it has long been the custom to coat the polished grains 
with talcum powder. The powder is mixed with a 
solution of glucose, which causes it to stick to the 
surface, and after the grains have been moistened 
with this suspension, they are dried. Rice which has 
been treated in this way can be readily detected, since 
the water in which it is washed becomes milky from 
the suspended talcum powder. This coated product 
is white rice. It has been both polished and coated. 
The so-called brown rice is polished rice which has 
received no further treatment. 

There is no reason whatever for whitening rice 

because it keeps just as well without it, but since it is 

Use of customary to wash the grains before cooking there is 

Polished uo reason for condemning it. Brown rice has no 

Rice Is superiority over white rice, and both have the same 

Rational dietary properties, and are inferior to the unpolished. 

53 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

The latter is not a complete food by itself. The ra- 
tional policy is to continue the use of polished rice, 
since there are good reasons why, when it is to enter 
commerce, with an uncertainty as to when it will be 
consumed, it should have the highest possible keeping 
qualities. In those localities where this cereal is 
grown and sold locally, it would doubtless oe best to 
select the unpolished article. This is '"kewise true 
for all people who^like many Orientals, live so largely 
on rice. 

OTHER GRAINSâ Many experimental studies Barley and 
have shown that the cereal grains resemble each other ^Â® 
very closely in their dietary properties. Barley and 
rye closely resemble wheat in that a dough can be 
made from them, but this property is less pronounced 
than in wheat because in them the amount of glutin- 
ous protein is less. 

BUCKWHEATâ Buckwheat forms a very sticky 
dough, and is widely used in Asia, Europe and 
America, for making griddle cakes. These have a 
dark and somewhat violet color, and a flavor which 
has made buckwheat cakes a national dish. It has 
been frequently observed that persons who have eaten 
freely of buckwheat developed "buckwheat itch." 
This is due to the fact that there is a dye in the seed 
which sensitizes the body to light. Albino animals 
which have been fed with buckwheat and are subse- 
quently exposed to sunlight die within a short time, 
while animals which are colored are not affected. The 
sensitiveness of certain persons to this inconvenience 
following indulgence in buckwheat cakes is probably 
due to lack of suflicient pigment in the skin. 

PEAS AND BEANSâ These, the legume seeds, 
enter into the diet of almost all peoples and are palat- ^j^ x ^ 
able and wholesome foods. There can be no doubt, 3^^^^ 
however, in the light of modern nutrition studies, 
that their dietary value has been greatly over rated. 

53 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

Their chemical composition as shown by analysis re- 
vealed a very high protein content. Before the days 
when it was known that there were great differences 
in the nutritive values of proteins from different 
sources, it was natural to suppose that peas and beans 
were in all essential respects the equivalent of meats 
as sources of protein. It was only discovered through 
experiments on animals which were restricted to one 
or the other of these seeds as their sole source of pro- 
tein, that the proteins of both are very inferior to 
those of meat. It is fallacious to regard beans as 
"the poor man's meat." 

The navy bean contains a considerable amount of 

certain peculiar carbohydrates which are not digest- 

TheNavy [\)\q^ but which readily undergo bacterial decomposi- 

Â®^" tion in the digestive tract, with the formation of much 

gas. As a result they tend to cause flatulence. Peas 

are not so subject to this type of fermentation. 

Beans and peas, while attractive in flavor to a cer- 
tain extent, fall far short of the platability of meats. 
In fact beans are usually cooked with meat to add to 
their acceptability. These facts are mentioned, not 
for the purpose of discouraging the use of peas and 
beans, but to make it clear that their place in the diet 
is distinctly a subordinate one. Used in moderation 
they form a valuable addition to the food supply, and 
help to afiford that variety which the palate of civilized 
man demands. With advancing knowledge they 
have, however, lost their once proud position of foods 
of extraordinary value. 

THE POTATO. This is in some respects unique 
as a vegetable food-stuft'. It is nearly without flavor, 
and lends itself to consumption with other things such 
The Potato as butter, cream or milk, salt and pepper or with fat. 
The appetite of man calls for fat and there are cer- 
tain foods which are eaten principally as a vehicle 
for carrying fat. The potato stands first in impor- 

54 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

tance among these. Some writers have attributed 
much greater nutritive value to the potato than ex- 
perimental studies on animals seem to justify. It is 
one of our most prolific food crops, and w^ill always 
remain one of our most important energy foods. It 
is indeed remarkable how regularly we accept the 
potato in one form or another, in contrast to the ease 
with which we surfeit on other similar vegetables 
such as turnip or beet or carrot, when these appear 
on the table daily for a time. We can eat much more 
liberally of the potato than any of these, and never 
tire of it as a daily article of diet. The lack of taste 
and individuality of the potato, which makes it pos- 
sible to confer palatability on it in several ways, seems 
to be the explanation for this. 

THE DASHEEN. This is a new vegetable which 
bids fair to take the place of the potato to some extent 
in some parts of the country. It is a large corm or 
bulb of a plant which grows well in some parts of 
the South, producing a large yield. It possesses a The Dasheen 
mild but distinctive flavor, and is served in essentially 
the same ways as the potato. Its dietary value is not 
essentially different from the latter. The Depart- 
ment of Agriculture has great expectations of this 
new food plant, and these seem to be well founded. 

THE SWEET POTATO. This root has found 
great favor in the warmer parts of the temperate 
zone. It contains much sugar as well as starch and 
is a most excellent food which remains acceptable The Sweet 
daily for long periods. Its place in the diet is essen- Potato 
tially the same as that of the white potato, i. e., it 
is a vehicle for fat and a source of energy because of 
its high content of starch and sugar. 

THE EDIBLE ROOTS. The most important 
edible roots other than the sweet potato in the tem- 
perate zones are the carrot, beet, turnip, and radish. 
These all deserve to be introduced into the diet more 

55 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

frequently than they now are. They, like the leafy 
Radish vegetables, are the best correctives for constipation, 
Turnip since they affect the eliminative function of the in- 
testine by modifying the residues so as to make them 
bulky and rich in water, but do not have irritating 
effects, as do bran or figs or berries which contain 
seeds in large numbers. This peculiar laxative effect 
is due to their high content of indigestible fibre, and 
its water-holding power. The edible roots appear to 
have no special dietary properties which distinguish 
them, or give them any special role to perform, except 
that mentioned, and their appetizing qualities, when 
not used too monotonously. Most people will tire of 
any one of them if they appear daily in the diet for 
a considerable time, but when they appear as a nov- 
elty after an absence of a short time they are greatly 
relished. The rotation of these in the menus of those 
months when they are in season will tend to dis- 
courage the tendency toward over-eating of the more 
concentrated foods. 

All of the above described food-stuffs have in the 
plant world the same functions to perform. They are 
all storage tissues of plants, and contain somewhere 
within them areas which are capable of growing into 
new plantlets under favorable conditions of temper- 
ature and moisture. The seeds grow from the germ ; 
the potato from the "eyes," and the fleshy roots from 
an area at the crown. Since the plantlet requires a 
food supply until it can develop a root system and 
leaves and become independent, the parent plant pro- 
vides this in the stored material within the seed, 
tuber or root. Man takes advantage of these con- 
centrated packages of food materials, and appropri- 
ates them for his food supply and for the feeding of 
his animals. 

Systematic studies have clearly shown that all of 
these plant parts which are store-houses for food for 

56 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

the little plants have certain shortcomings in common 
from the standpoint of animal and human nutrition. 
It is interesting to note that although there are very 
w^ide variations in the chemical composition, some, t,, e*

as the pea and bean, contamnig much protein and Tissues of 
little digestible carbohydrate, while others such as Plants 
the potato, contain much starch and but little protein, 
the dietary properties of all show striking similari- 
ties. They all contain too little of the element cal- 
cium, or lime, to meet the needs of a growing animal, 
and probably also of the adult. With few exceptions 
they are too poor in the peculiar substance which 
gives butter fat its special dietary properties, and 
without which a deficiency disease especially affect- 
ing the eyes will develop. In addition, the quality 
of their proteins is poor, and in a general way their 
proteins seem to have certain defects in common, so 
that when foods of this class are used together they 
do not greatly enhance each other's values. There 
are some exceptions to this rule, for some combina- 
tions within this group of storage tissue foods have 
distinctly better proteins than either constituent of 
the mixture when fed alone. 

FRUITS. Fruits and nuts are the most appetiz- 
ing of the vegetable foods. The fruits such as the 
apple, pear, peach, plum and the various berries and 
citrus fruits are so rich in water that they have but 
little value as sources of energy (starch, sugar, pro- special 
tein, fats). They all contain certain salts of organic value 
acids which have more or less stimulating action on 
the kidneys, and some of them have a laxative effect. 
This is augmented by the indigestible marc or struc- 
tural tissues which, like the fibrous structures of cer- 
tain other vegetable foods, tends to retain water in 
the intestine and produce physical properties in its 
contents which render them more easily eliminable. 

The fruits, and those vegetables which can be

THE TOMATO. This deserves special mention 
because of its great popularity as a constituent of 
salads, as well as a source of flavor in soups, spa- 
ghetti, etc., and in the form of ketchup. It is a water- 
rich substance and does not furnish much actual food 
value, but is remarkable as a condimental food. The

Prevents vegetable foods in that the substance which protects 
Scurvy against scurvy, and which it contains in relative 
abundance, is not so easily destroyed in heating or 
drying as it is in most other foods. Because it is 
much cheaper than orange juice, Dr. Hess recom- 
mends tomato juice in small amounts as a means of 
preventing scurvy in infants which are fed on pas- 
teurized milk. It is reported that a small quantity 
of canned tomato will allay thirst for a time as effec- 
tively as fifteen times its volume of water. It was 
used for this purpose during the late war when the 
men were in positions where water could not be sup- 
. plied regularly. 

BANANAS. The banana, owing to its relative 
cheapness during a large part of the year, is a good 
fruit, and should be made use of in salads, or eaten as 
the appetite calls for it at any meal. Some find diffi- 
culty in digesting it unless it is fully ripe, for in the 
green and semi-ripe condition it contains considerable 
amounts of raw starch. Over ripe bananas do not

have so good a flavor as they do a little earlier in the Bananas 
ripening stage. They are free from bacteria when p^Â°p** 
not invaded by organisms in the fruit as it begins to ^^ 
spoil, and may safely be given to children to satisfy 
their hunger w^hen they request food between meals. â¢ 

THE LEAFY VEGETABLES. Modern nutri- 
tion studies have revealed the unsuspected fact that 
the leaf of the plant possesses dietary properties 
which chemical analysis does not reveal, and this 
class of vegetable foods have assumed a new and 
unique place in the human diet. Certain leaves form 
a complete food supply for such types of animals as 
have sufficiently capacious digestive tracts to enable Leafy 
them to eat a large quantity of bulky food. The om- vegetables 
niverous animals cannot thrive solely on leafy foods Are 
because they cannot eat enough of them. Neverthe- Protective 
less the liberal consumption of leafy vegetables serves 
to correct the deficiencies of the group of foods which 
have the function of storage organs in plants, and 
make it possible for man to do fairly well on a strictly 
vegetarian diet, at least for a considerable period. 
The importance of leafy vegetables as supplements 
to the cereals, peas, beans, tubers and edible roots is 
so great that one or another of those which are ac- 
ceptable to the human palate should enter into the 
diet every day in some form. 

The most important of the leafy vegetables which 
have sufficiently mild flavors to make them suitable 
for consumption by man are spinach, lettuce, cabbage, 
chard, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, collards, kale, T^^ ^^^ 
turnip and beet tops, dandelion, water cress, lambs- Leaves 
quarter, rape, and a few others. The onion bulb is 
a mass of thickened leaves. Their special virtues lie 
in the desirable composition of their mineral content; 
in their richness in the three substances which pro- 
tect against the deficiency diseases (See p. . . . ) ; in 
the way in which they supplement the deficiencies of

about by the addition of a liberal amount of such a 
leaf as celery tops, spinach or turnip tops, to the diet 
is unbelievable unless it is witnessed. It is unfor- 
tunate that these leafy foods are not so highly attrac- 
tive and palatable as to make their consumption in 
liberal amounts pleasurable to the average American. 
This is largely due to the fact that they have been 
used so sparingly in this country that the habit of 
eating them has never been formed to any great ex- 
tent. To many people in the South, where the use 
of turnip greens is very commonj they are highly 
relished, and form a veritable treat to those who 
have been for some time without them. One of the 
most important lessons which has been taught by 
scientific nutrition studies is the need of developing 
a liking for and a great increase in the consumption 
of this class of vegetables in the American family. 
Every conscientious mother should see to it that her 
children learn to like them in early childhood, and 
that they find a regular place in the diet as the chil- 
dren grow up.

into greater favor than the common kind. It is much 
more delicate in texture and flavor than ordinary 
cabbage, and makes a truly delicious salad plant. 

STRING BEANS AND ASPARAGUS are two immature

the formation of the seeds, its quality as a food differs 
decidedly from the seeds after they have become

this stage of growth should become more common. 
They may be boiled and buttered, or creamed, or 
used as a constituent of salads. The tender rapidly 
growing tips of asparagus are rich in actively func- 
tioning cells, and resemble thick leaves in their die- 
tary properties. 

In China, Japan and other Oriental countries 
where there is no dairy industry, the practice of eat- 
ing large amounts of leafy vegetables is universal. 
The leaves of the sweet potato plant, the petals of the 
lily and bamboo sprouts are eaten as staple articles of g"^!^*^^ 1 
diet, along with numerous other leafy structures of Leafy Food 
plants. The good physical development of certain 
groups of Chinese appears to be attributable in great 
measure to this peculiarity in their eating habits. The 
consumption of green vegetables is the outstanding 
feature of their diet. These possess special qualities 
which differentiate them sharply from all other prod- 
ucts of the garden and we should greatly extend their 
use. 

Thick leaves such as those of the cabbage are not Thick Leaves

such as spinach, turnip tops, etc.

has become accustomed. All races are fond of meats,

of his appetite by extreme cold, is able to eat large 
quantities of fat without anything with it to render 
its consumption easier. While the natives of the 
tropics and temperate regions of the world like fat, 
they always like to eat it with a carrier such as po- 
tato, sweet potato, cabbage, etc., to conceal it.

He does not in general like the strongly flavored

habits and likings of man under different living con- 
ditions serve to emphasize the uncertainty of the ap- 
petite as a guide to the proper selection of food. 

It is not desirable to dispense with meats in the 
diet, for they fulfill a psychic requirement from which 
we cannot free ourselves. It is sound policy to eat 
foods which taste good, for taste and the enjoyment 
of food are indispensable to eflicient digestion. Ex- 
cessive meat eating certainly has, however, a damag- 
ing effect on the body. It is easily possible to arrange 
diets free from meat which will induce good nutrition, 
but very moderate amounts of meat certainly do no Consump- 
harm. Since the maintenance of an animal industry ******

culture, we shall always have a meat supply which 
should be used judiciously in the diet. It is agreed 
by all competent to judge that the consumption of 
meat by the average American household is excessive. 
High meat consumption is generally responsible for 
high protein consumption, and the abuse of meat has 
been the most important cause for the spread of the 
belief that man is better nourished and will be more 
eflicient if he takes a diet low in protein. Many peo- 
ple feel better when they stop eating meat, but this

THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

is due not so much to the fact that a proper amount 
of meat is bad, as to the inabihty of many to stop 
eating when they have had enough when meat forms 
a principal article of diet, because of its appeal to the 
appetite. 

It has been pointed out in the preceding chapter 
that the excessive growth of putrefactive bacteria in 
Meats Favor the large intestine is attended with disastrous results 
Putrefaction Q^[j^g ^q |.]^g toxic nature of the products which they 
Intestine form. These exert an irritating action on the lining 
of the intestine, and burden the liver and kidneys 
with their destruction and excretion. Among all the 
protein-rich foods there is none which encourages the 
growth of these pernicious organisms so much as 
meat. Thousands of persons past middle age, who 
have had time to become debilitated by faulty nutri- 
tion, testify to the relief from discomfort and in- 
creased efficiency which they experience as the result 
of partially or wholly eliminating meat from the diet. 

Although meat can safely be entirely dispensed 
with, provided the individual is willing to forego the 
satisfaction of eating it, the semi-invalid has not in- 
frequently subjected himself to a dietary regime so 
Meat Should monotonous and faulty as to hasten his demise. The 
Be Eaten cause of malnutrition is usually a complex one, and 
sparingly cannot in general be correctly attributed to one or 
another food, such as meat, which in too liberal 
amounts produces conditions in the alimentary tract 
which are unfavorable to health and comfort. The 
sanest view seems to be to reduce the meat consump- 
tion to the lowest level consistent with securing the 
degree of palatability which is demanded by the aver- 
age person, by reason of habits developed by our 
present mode of life. But this by itself is not enough. 
The diet must be selected so as to be complete, and 
to promote well-being.

Meats contain proteins of high value in nutrition. Meats 
In other respects, however, they cannot be regarded jn^L^J^" 
as in any sense food of unusual merit. The mineral 
content is deficient in the same general way as that 
of the cereals, tubers and roots. It is especially poor 
in lime, but is unusually rich in phosphorus and iron, 
both of which are not very abundant in most grains 
or other storage tissues of plants. Muscle tissue con- 
tains but little of any of the three substances which 
are concerned with the prevention of the deficiency 
diseases, a fact which is rather surprising, but which 
is well established by experiments on animals. 

Meats contain excessive amounts of acid-forming Meats Are 
elements, and need to be properly combined with por^grs 
foods rich in bases of mineral nature to give best re- 
sults in nutrition. Meats do not correct the defi- 
ciencies of a diet composed otherwise of seeds, tubers 
and roots, except in the improvement in the quality 
of the protein. It is easy to correct all of these defi- 
ciencies by the liberal use of milk and green leafy 
vegetables, but the latter do not add to the attractive- 
ness of the diet in palatability as do meats. 

MILK. From time immemorial the milk of There is No 
cows, camels, buffaloes, goats, sheep and mares has f^J^^iik * 
been used throughout eastern Europe and parts of 
Asia as an important article of the diet of man. Mod- 
ern nutrition studies have shown that milk is the one 
food for which there is no effective substitute. Its 
use has extended over western Europe and NortTi 
America, and to most countries which have been 
settled by European peoples. 

In Europe and America, milk is ordinarily used Use of Milk 
fresh either as a beverage or in cookery, or frozen i" America 
with the addition of other substances as ice cream. ^*^^ Europe 
No pronounced bacterial changes are allowed to take 
place in it before use. Much is used for the manu-

THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

facture of butter, cream and cheese. The skim milk 
is generally used as food for calves and hogs, but 
much is thrown away. When cheese is manufactured 
the whey is usually poured into the gutter, but some 
is fed to pigs. The Laplander eats large amounts of 
reindeer milk, which is frozen in skins, and kept 
throughout the winter. 

The inhabitants of the steppes of European Rus- 
sia, and the plains of south, western and central Asia 
Fermented collect the milk of mares, and to a lesser extent that 
of cows, and add to it in skin bottles or in tubs, a 
portion of old, sour milk and some water and allow 
it to ferment. The fermentation is a mixed one and 
leads to the formation of much lactic acid which 
causes the sourness, but a considerable amount of 
alcohol is likewise formed. The curd is broken up 
by vigorous agitation and is allowed to stand several 
days before use. This product is known as koumiss. 
When cows' milk is used for this purpose it is first 
skimmed. Kephir is another kind of fermented prod- 
uct made from the milk of cows, goats and sheep, 
and is used universally in the Caucasus. It contains 
both lactic acid and alcohol. A similar product, 
matzoon, is made in Armenia. In India, in those 
parts suited to stock raising, a fermented milk known 
as dadhi is widely used, and a similar product, leben, 
forms an important article of diet with the Arabs, and 
was used by the Egyptians and Carthaginians from 
remote antiquity. 

Metchnikofif, the famous Russian bacteriologist, 
first pointed out that there were in his days a remark- 
able number of centenarians among the people of 
Organism Servia, Bulgaria and Roumania, and he sought to 
discover the secret of the long life of many of these 
people. He found that they live largely on a soured 
milk which they call yoghourt, and he came to the 
conclusion that the regular use of milk soured by a

special race of lactic-acid-forming bacteria to which 
he gave the name bacillus Bulgaricus, was in great 
measure responsible for their health and longevity. 
He explained this on the theory that the putrefactive 
decomposition of proteins in the intestine causes in- 
jury to the body because of the poisonous nature of 
the products formed and absorbed, and that the pres- 
ence of the organism which sours milk leads to the 
constant formation of a mild acidity in the intestine 
which is unfavorable to the growth of the more harm- 
ful forms which thrive in its absence. 

BACILLUS BULGARIOUS is a special race of 
milk-souring organism which produces a greater 
amount of acid than the more common ones; hence 
the assumption that it produces a more effective sour 
milk than milks which sour spontaneously every- 
where. Metchnikoff held that the organism had spe- 
cial vitality and could be made to establish itself in 
the intestine as a more or less persistent inhabitant. 
This view is not supported by the many studies which 
have been made by later observers. 

There has been much discussion and difference of 
opinion as to the importance of the lactic acid bacil- Sour Milk

of widely different natures. It seems, in the light of 
what we now know of the peculiar dietary properties 
of milk, wholly aside from the presence or absence of 
any special type of bacteria in it, that the excellent 
health of the aged natives of the Balkan states, as 
well as of other peoples who live largely on milk 
products, is the result of their regular consumption 
of a most excellent food supply, and not to the pres- 
ence of the bacteria which it may contain. It can-

not be denied that the lactic acid fermentation of 
milk may be a factor of some importance, but this 
is secondary rather than primary. 
Milk a j^ jg ^ f^^|- ^QQ ^gjj known to need comment, that 
Food i^ilk is a complete food for a young, growing animal, 
and that for a certain period after birth, a period 
which varies with the species, no other food can take 
its place without disaster. It is not so well known 
that milk is a food of exceptional value for the adult, 
although a few medical men have fully appreciated 
this fact. Dr. Weir Mitchell many years ago had 
remarkable success in the treatment of patients suf- 
fering from neurasthenia, by keeping them in bed 
confined to a diet which was principally milk. It is 
of unusual interest to note that Harvey, the discov- 
erer of the circulation of the blood, in reporting on 
his autopsy of Thomas Parr, who is stated to have 
lived to the age of 153 years, says that his diet until 
just before his death when he was invited to the court 
of King Charles in 1635, consisted of sub-rancid 
cheese, and milk in every form, coarse bread and 
small drink, generally sour whey.

which are essential for the nutrition of the body, and 
Is Deficient ^^ especially rich in everything that is necessary to

Iron tuber and root products which form so large a part 
of the diet of civilized man. It is deficient only in 
iron. Its fat is the best source of the unidentified 
substance which protects against the deficiency dis- 
ease involving the eyes. This substance is not found 
in any vegetable fats or oils, and aside from butter 
fat is abundant only in egg yolk among our common 
food-stuffs. The glandular organs and the leaves of 
plants contain it in greater amounts than do any of 
the foods whose function is that of storage tissues

of plants. Fresh, unheated milk contains the sub- ^*^^ 
stance which is protective against scurvy, but this o'the/F^ods* 
is nearly all destroyed during pasteurization or boil- 
ing. The substance w^hich protects against beri-beri 
is fairly abundant in milk and is not destroyed by or- 
dinary cooking. The proteins of milk are of very high 
quality. 

Milk is therefore so constituted as to make an 
ideal food for supplementing the ordinary vegetable 
foods which should form a considerable part of our 
diet. It corrects the deficiencies of these in a remark- 
able way. In order to obtain best results, however, 
it is best to use with the ordinary vegetable foods, 
but a small amount of meat, a quart of milk a day 
for each member of the family, and as much of one 
or another of the green leafy vegetables as the appe- 
tite will permit. The sugar of milk promotes, when 
such a diet is taken, the growth of a very favorable 
bacterial flora in the intestine. 

SKIM MILK is ordinarily looked upon as of little 
value, but as a matter of fact it is worth more than 
the cream from the standpoint of nutrition. The 
more extended use of skim milk in bread making, in 
cookery and as a sour milk beverage as is so common 
in Eastern Europe would be an important step in the 
direction of securing better nutrition for the nation. 

BUTTER MILK is milk from which the fat has 
been removed and from which the sugar has been Composition 
used up by lactic acid fermentation in the souring o^ Butter 
process. It is the milk which accompanies the fats 
as they are removed in the form of cream. Since it 
is milk less two of its constituents, fat and sugar, its 
dietary properties can be readily understood. It is 
not the equivalent of whole milk, but is a valuable 
addition to the diet, both from the standpoint of the 
addition of nutrients and for its appetizing quality.

a peculiar pathological condition of the eyes. Butter

CHEESE made from whole milk contains most

a condimentai food, and should not be eaten too 
freely for various reasons. It is an extremely con- 
centrated food and may induce indigestion if taken 
in liberal amounts. Its bacteriological condition is 
frequently decidedly undesirable in that there are 
present large numbers of spores of putrefactive bac- 
teria, which it is not well to introduce into the di- 
gestive tract unless it is in a very vigorous condition, 
and unless there are taken such other foods as tend 
to make an environment in the intestine which is un- 
favorable to their growth. The high degree of palata- 
bility of cheeses, especially the mild ones, makes their 
inclusion in the diet as an occasional constituent de- 
sirable. A liking for strong cheeses, which are actu- 
ally in a state of putrefaction, must be acquired, and 
is the parallel of the liking for tainted meats which 
is seen in some people. There are sound physiolog- 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 



ical reasons against their use. Probably the best way 
to use cheese, especially for those whose digestion 
is not vigorous, is with macaroni or in a cream sauce, 
where it is heated before use, or toasted on crackers. 

ICE CREAM is one of the most attractive forms 
in which to serve milk, as well as one of the simplest 
from the standpoint of labor. Flavored and sweet- 
ened as it is, it has found great favor in the American 
home because of its palatability. The commercial 
ice cream business has reached enormous proportions, 
and the tendency seems to be growing to purchase it 
from a dealer instead of freezing it in the home be- 
cause of the trouble attending its preparation. It is 
easy to learn to operate an ice cream freezer and 
where fruits are available and cheap as they are on 
farms or in small villages these as well as milk and 
cream can be served in this most attractive form and 
with little expense. 

While there are doubtless many ice cream manu- 
facturers who maintain high standards, some have 
abused the confidence of their customers by re-freez- 
ing and selling cream which has been left over, and 
melted. Sometimes stale milk which is not in good 
bacteriological condition is worked off in the frozen 
condition, masked by flavors and sweetening. When 
the ice cream mixture is frozen it "swells," or in- 
creases greatly in volume. This is advantageous up 
to a certain point for a heavy ice cream is not so good, 
and an amount which is taken at one time into the 
mouth would be too cold to be eaten in comfort. This 
difficulty is obviated by extending the lightness of 
the product by stirring air into it so that a spoonful 
contains only about half as much substance as it ap- 
pears to contain. The swelling of ice cream during 
freezing is not to be regarded as unfair to the pur- 
chaser so long as the increase in volume is secured 
only for the purpose of making the product more pal-

securing excessive profits on a food product. 

The fat content of ice cream varies greatly, and 
there is need of more uniform standards of composi- 
tion. The best creams may contain as much as eigh- 
Fat Content ^^^^^ P^r cent of butter fat. Perhaps more than half 
of Ice of the commercial ice cream does not contain more 
Cream than half this amount, and some samples of "hokey- 
pokey" ice creams which are sold to children in the 
poorer sections of cities have shown, on analysis, only 
two to four per cent of butter fat. Occasionally 
vegetable fats are put in instead of milk fat. This is 
aduleration. 

Cheap ice creams often contain large amounts of 

"fillers," consisting of cheaper materials such as corn- 

yse of starch or skim milk. Fortunately skim milk is the 

"Fillers niost common of these, and as has been stated, this 

part of the milk has a greater food value than the 

cream, although its palatability is lower. 

Within certain limits the intelligent adult will rec- 
ognize quality in ice cream, and would not continue 
to purchase from a dealer whose product is too fluffy, 
but there should be carefully regulated standards for 
the amount of "swell" which Ts permitted. This is 
necessary for the protection of children especially.

The attractiveness of ice cream is so great that the 
poor children in large cities buy it in cones to a large 
extent rather than candy. This is probably respons- 
ible, in many cases, for the preservation of life in 
the case of children from homes where the diet 
consists of little more than bread, meat and tea or 
coffee. To be sure, in such homes the money could 
be much better spent for milk, since it w^ould be 
cheaper, and for the same price, more could be pur- 
chased, and the children's diet improved in greater 
degree. As a rule, how^ever, no milk v^ould be bought 
by such people because it does not appeal so strongly 
to the appetite, and the money is better spent for ice 
cream, liberally "filled" with skim milk, than for 
more bread or meat. The casual purchase of ice 
cream by poor children is therefore a matter of much 
greater importance than it might at first thought ap- 
pear to be. 

When ice cream is purchased, care should be taken 
to patronize the best manufacturers. By appreciat- 
ing their high standards, and showing that apprecia- 
tion, the abuses in the industry will be eliminated. 
The health department in every city should be able 
to advise the woman in the home concerning the most 
satisfactory dealers. It cannot be too often repeated 
that there is in every city an organization under the 
control of medical men and bacteriologists and chem- 
ists who are doing what they can to safe-guard the 
public interests in inspecting foods and market con- 
ditions. The public should appreciate them and aid 
them in their work, and in turn be aided by them. 

OLEOMARGARINE is made from various ani- 
mal and vegetable fats and is sold as a substitute for 
butter. It has become widely used because of its 
lower cost as compared with butter. It cannot be 
denied that vegetable and animal fats have a dietary 
value and are wholesom^e foods. They lack the pe-

culiar quality found in milk fats (butter) and egg 
yolk fats, however, and are not in every sense substi- 
tutes for butter. 

Since any diet v^hich is derived solely from seed 
products, tubers and meat, or other foods having the 
same dietary properties, will be deficient in at least 
two respects, and the same type of diet without meat 
will be deficient in three respects, it requires some- 
SubsHtutes thing more than butter to correct them. For this 
reason we advise the use of milk in liberal amounts. 
It is immaterial whether the milk be separated into 
its constituents and used as skim milk in cookery, 
cream, butter, cheese, etc., or as whole milk as a bev- 
erage. The important point is to secure the consump- 
tion of a sufBcient amount of all the constituents of 
milk. When this is accomplished in one way or an- 
other, it matters little what kind of fat one spreads on 
his bread. 

EGGS contain everything which the body needs 
for its development, but nevertheless need to be prop- 
erly combined with other foods. Like milk and the 
Dietary ^^^^7 vegetables eggs are to be regarded as additions 
Properties to the cereal, tuber and root portion of the food sup- 
of the Egg ply to improve its quality. They are to be classed 
with the protective foods, but lack two qualities of 
importance for which milk is remarkable. The portion 
of the egg after the shell is discarded, is not so rich 
in lime as it should be to supplement bread, cereals, 
potato, etc., and the egg favors the growth of putre- 
factive bacteria in the intestine in much the same 
way as does meat. The special role of milk in depres- 
sing these organisms is due to the milk sugar, which 
enables fermentative organisms to grow and keep 
down the more harmful rotting types. The fats of 
the egg have essentially the same dietary value as but- 
ter fat, and they are superior to vegetable fats or to 
the body fats of animals, such as lard, tallow, etc.

Eggs are especially attractive both in appearance Should be 
and flavor. Most persons will tire of them if served p*Â®** *" 
too frequently, but they have become so expensive Desserts 
that there is little danger of this in the average home. 
Where it is desired to practice economy, it is not 
wise to serve eggs directly, but to make use of them 
in the preparation of cakes and custards, or in ice 
cream, etc. In such forms they go further toward 
adding attractiveness to the diet than when served 
fried, boiled, poached, etc. . They are especially at- 
tractive as a garnish for salads or spinach. 

SUGAR was not used extensively until the last 
century. Before that time honey and manna were 
highly prized. Crude sugar had- been manufactured xoo Much 
in India from times of great antiquity, and the Amer- Sugar Being 
ican Indians made maple sugar before the discovery Eaten 
of America, According to statistics a century ago 
the consumption of sugar in the United States was 
only about 11 pounds per person per year, but its 
use has increased very rapidly and has reached the re- 
markable figure of 86 pounds per person per year. 
This amount is certainly excessive. There are many 
persons who have developed an abnormal craving for 
sweets, which doubtless is reflected in poor nutrition. 
Sugar contains no mineral matter and is solely use- 
ful as a source of energy for keeping the body warm 
and for supplying energy for muscular work. 

Cane sugar is somewhat irritating to the digestive 
tract, and easily undergoes fermentation when the 
digestion is impaired, with the formation of gas. It 
is a valuable food when used in moderation, but the 
use of sugar and syrups in cookery and in the form 
of candies has gone beyond the bounds of reason or 
physiological justification. In particular, the craving 
for sweet foods leads to failure to appreciate the nat- 
ural flavors of the ordinary wholesome foods, and 
incapacitates one for making a wise choice of food. 

75 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

While it is not wise to discontinue the use of sugar, it 
should be emphasized that the demand for sweet 
foods is an artificially acquired taste, and is almost 
as pernicious as the craving for alcohol. 

TEA AND COFFEE. These beverages, now so 
universally used in many countries, have a remark- 
Effects of g^i^ig stimulating efifect on the brain. They increase 
^Coffee ^^^ reasoning power and the imagination. When 
taken by those who are not accustomed to their use 
they produce wakefulness. They are habit-forming 
beverages because of the alkaloid caffeine which they 
contain. They change the nature of the heart beat, 
and stimulate the action of the kidneys. 

There has been much discussion as to the effects 
of the use of tea and coffee over a long period, but 
little definite can be said concerning them. In chil- 
dren they certainly contribute to instability of the 
nervous system, and their use during the growing 
period is universally condemned. Many persons be- 
come so habituated to their use that the omission of 
the customary dose leads to discomfort. Probably 
their use to this extent does some damage in the long 
run. When used very weak they furnish a hot drink 
which most adults enjoy, and when not used to excess 
their use probably gives sufficient satisfaction to coun- 
terbalance their slight detrimental effects. 

For those who engage in mental work, the wisest 
policy would seem to be to refrain from acquiring 
the habit of regular coffee or tea drinking, and there- 
by preserve the sensitiveness of the nervous system 
for them, so that when one or another is taken on 
special occasions, a period of several hours of unusual 
intellectual clearness may be secured. Those who 
are inclined to nervousness would probably do well 
never to form the habit of drinking either, since their 
use tends to increase irritabilitv.

Poisoning 
Is Common. 



Chapter V. 

DANGEROUS FOODS AND THE CARE OF 
FOOD IN THE HOME 

DANGEROUS FOODS. Cases of food poison- 
ing are frequently reported in the newspapers, but 
there is much reason to beHeve that they occur much 
oftener than they are reported, for mild cases nat- 
urally do not attract attention. Some foods are dan- 
gerous because they contain poisons, but the great 
majority of cases of poisoning by foods is the result 
of bacterial growth, or of the presence of bacteria 
which can infect man and cause illness. Everyone 
should be familiar with the fact that it is not safe 
to eat certain foods, and also with the danger which 
may result from failure to care for food properly in 
the home. 

Among the foods which are more or less common- 
ly eaten by man, but which frequently cause illness 
or death, the mushrooms deserve first consideration. 
There are a number of varieties which closely resem- 
ble the edible species, and which are sometimes mis- 
taken for them, which contain deadly poisons. No 
general directions can be given for distinguishing 
the safe from the unsafe kinds, for the features which Mushroom 
distinguish them are not prominent, and can be safely PoÂ»so"*nfi 
judged only by one who has studied mushrooms very 
carefully. It is dangerous to eat mushrooms which 
have been gathered by anyone who has not had con- 
siderable experience, and especially who is familiar 
with the forms which grow in the particular locality. 
Many cases of poisoning have resulted among for- 
eigners who were accustomed to gather mushrooms 
with confidence and safety in their own country, but 
who mistook related species or varieties which were 
deadly for similar ones which are harmless.

Oxalic Acid

Fresh Fish 

Generally

Some species of sorrel are very rich in oxalic acid, 
a highly poisonous substance, while others contain 
much less. It is not safe to use sorrels indiscrim- 
inately for the preparation of ''sour-grass soup," or 
for pies, as was formerly common in the Middle West. 
It is better to entirely avoid eating sorrel of any kind, 
and especially discourage children from eating it, as 
they frequently do in rural districts. 

A number of cases of poisoning with oxalic acid 
were reported in England during the war as the result 
of people eating the leaves of rhubarb. The stems 
contain much less of the acid than do the leaves, and 
the latter should never be used as greens. It is not 
wise to eat rhubarb stalks beyond very moderate 
amounts and then not regularly. 

FISH. Some species of fish are poisonous at all 
times (globe-fish, puffers and balloon fish), but these 
and others, especially those from the waters of tem- 
perate regions, are well recognized as dangerous and 
are not offered for sale. Certain other fish are poi- 
sonous only during the spawning season, and are not 
offered for sale at this time. It may be definitely 
stated that there is no danger in the use of fish which 
are commonly sold, but with the growing demand 
for additional sources of food at the present time, 
there is some cause to be careful about the use of a 
fish which has not generally been upon the market. 
The U. S. Bureau of Fisheries has given close atten- 
tion to the supervision of fishes sold as food and there 
is but very remote possibility of poisoning from fish 
which are inherently dangerous. 

INFECTED FOODS. By far the greatest dan- 
ger from food poisoning lies in the use of food which 
is infected with bacteria which either generate poi- 
sons in it, or which cause infection when they are 
taken into the digestive tract. In most cases poison- 
ing from this source is easily avoidable if certain sim-

pie rules are observed. The danger is greatest from 
badly handled milk, meats and fish, but occasionally 
other foods have been implicated in cases of food 
poisoning. 

Gastrointestinal disturbances affecting a number intestinal 
of persons, which develop shortly after eating of the infection 
same dish, are as a rule due to infection by an organ- sp^jig^j 
ism known as the paratyphoid bacillus. Infection Foods 
has not infrequently followed the eating of meat from 
an animal which was ill when slaughtered. The De- 
partment of Agriculture now maintains a very effi- 
cient meat inspection service at all points where large 
numbers of animals are killed for food purposes, and 
the danger to the public health is greatly minimized 
thereby. The meat from infected animals may pre- 
sent no evidences of abnormality, either in color, odor 
or consistency, but illness may follow the consump- 
tion of very small amounts. There is more danger 
in meats which are obtained from animals slaughtered 
outside of regularly established and inspected abat- 
toirs. 

MEAT INFECTION BY DISEASED PER- 
SONS. There is always the possibility that meat 
or other food may become infected bv being- handled ^. , 
in the home by a person who persistently harbors persons 
the paratyphoid organism in the intestine. These should Not 
persons eliminate large numbers of the bacteria in ^^^^^^ 
the urine, and unless their standards of personal 
cleanliness are very high they become a source of 
danger to the health of the household, especially if 
they handle food. Food which becomes contaminat- 
ed with these organisms is rendered harmless by 
thorough cooking, but heating in such a manner as 
does not cause the interior part of it to become ster- 
ilized leads to the infection of those who eat it. It 
becomes especially dangerous when kept at room

temperature or in an inefficient refrigerator for a time 
after imperfect cooking. 

Persons suffering from diarrhea should never pre- 
pare food for others, and too great care cannot be 
exercised about cleanliness of the hands of all who 
are engaged in cooking. Thorough cooking is the 
best safeguard against this type of food poisoning, 
but it must be remembered that in ordinary kitchen 
practice the interior of a roast, or of many baked 
dishes, fails to reach a sufficiently high temperature 
to destroy the ofifending organisms if they be pres- 
ent. There are many evidences of this in the data 
collected in epidemics of food poisoning. The old 
name of ptomaine poisoning is now^ falling into dis- 
use, since it has been learned that bacteria are gen- 
erally the active agents which cause the trouble. 

Fifty-five girls in a school in Ireland ate of a beef 

stew, the meat of which was infected. Fifty-three 

Instances ^^ them were made ill, and eight died. Others among 

of Food the girls who ate some of the beef as a cold meat 

Poisoning, were made seriously ill. In this case the meat was 

not sufficiently heated in the preparation of the stew, 

to render it harmless. 

In 1915 there was an outbreak of food poisoning 
at Westerly, Rhode Island, which was traced to the 
eating of infected pies. Apple, squash, custard, lemon 
and chocolate pies were all found to have caused ill- 
ness of people who ate at a certain restaurant, and 
the cause was found to lie in the use of the same batch 
of crust for the entire lot of pies. The person who 
prepared the crust was doubtless infected with the 
paratyphoid bacillus. 

A remarkable outbreak of poisoning from food 
occurred at Hanford, California, in 1914, at a church 
supper. Ninety-three persons were infected with 
typhoid fever. Only those who ate of a dish of spa- 
ghetti were made ill, and the source of the infection

was traced to the woman who prepared this food. 
She was a typhoid carrier, and had contaminated the 
spaghetti with her hands, which were unclean. The 
organisms developed rapidly in the interval before 
baking, and the interior of the mass was not suffi- 
ciently heated to destroy them. The State Depart- 
ment of Health of California conducted experiments 
with baking spaghetti, and found that such heat 
treatment as was given the dish which was served 
at the church supper only served to render the central 
portion warm enough to enable the germs of typhoid 
fever to multiply rapidly. 

Such serious instances of poisoning are rare, but 
smaller ones in which the members of a single family 
or a slightly larger group are affected are quite com- 
mon. The danger is sufficiently great to warrant 
cautioning all who prepare food or who supervise 
others who do so, to be on their guard, and to acquire 
habits of thoroughness in the heating of foods of cer- 
tain kinds, so as to make it impossible for dangerous 
organisms such as those of typhoid or paratyphoid 
fever to survive. 

The history of epidemics of food poisoning also 
make it clear that the health of all persons who pre- 
pare or serve food in public eating places should be 
carefully looked after. The tragic history of Mary 
Mallory illustrates an extreme case of the infection ^j^ 
of others by a person who persistently carried the Typhoid 
germs of typhoid fever. She was a cook and served Carrier 
in and about New York City. One large hospital 
epidemic and at least seven family epidemics were 
traced to her. 

The protection of food against contamination 
with typhoid organisms through water containing 
them is another important matter which should be 
understood by all, A well which is regarded as safe 
as a source of water may suddenly become dangerous

after a heavy rain which has washed into it surface 
water from soil contaminated with human excreta. In 
most cities the water supply is now carefully looked 
after, and the transmission of disease by it is steadily 
becoming less common, but on farms and in villages 
there may still be considerable danger from this 
source. Since the family milk supply usually comes 
from farms which are not above suspicion, it is best

Disease Water which has become contaminated with sewage 
may be a source of danger in transmitting harmful 
bacteria to food which has been washed in it, or the 
contamination may be brought about by washing 
milk cans or other utensils or dishes with impure 
water. The logic of rinsing dishes after washing in 
scalding water rests on a sound hygienic basis. Once 
typhoid or paratyphoid organisms are introduced into 
food, they may multiply very rapidly if the temper- 
ature is suitable as it is in hot weather, and food 
which was wholesome becomes within a day or two 
a menace to the health of those who eat it. City 
water which is carefully guarded as to its purity not 
infrequently becomes more or less dangerous imme- 
diately after a heavy storm which floods the sewers 
and washes unusual quantities of surface water into 
the reservoirs. At such times it would make for 
safety to the health of the family if the drinking water 
for a few days was boiled. 

A large proportion of those outbreaks of food 
poisoning which have been investigated have been

growth. Such meats are frequently allowed to grow 
stale before being sold to the consumer, and sausage 
and Hamburg steak are not infrequently eaten with- 
out adequate heating to render them safe. Sausage 
of the kinds which are eaten raw are by no means 
safe foods. Meat pies and meat jellies have caused 
many outbreaks of food poisoning because of the 
common failure to heat them sufficiently before being 
eaten. 

Because of the special importance of milk as a 
human food, and the common habit of taking it raw 
except in the larger cities, it deserves special consid- 
eration. Milk has been responsible for many cases 
of food-born infections because it is especially liable 
to become infected. Probably no less than ten per 
cent of all dairy cows in the country are infected 
with tuberculosis. The bovine tubercle bacillus is 
different in several respects from the human type, 
and there was for a time much discussion as to 
whether the bovine form could infect human beings. 
The evidence is overwhelmingly in support of the 
view that the human infant and the young of do- 
mestic animals can contract the disease from the 
milk of tuberculous cows. Milk from diseased cows 
is much less dangerous to adults, but there are ob- 
vious esthetic reasons, if no other were available, 
why such milk should not be used as food. 

The opportunity for milk to become infected is 
very great. Cows are rarely kept as clean as they 
should be; the dust from the air of the barn always 
gets into the milk pail to some extent even where sat- J^^"^Â®^*

times such as to disqualify him for his business. Yet

porary illness or during the early stages of disease 
which later incapacitates him for work. Add these 
factors to the long interval between the drawing of 
the milk and its delivery, which not infrequently in- 
tervenes when milk has to be carried from the farm 
to the city; the common practice of delivering the 
milk from a number of farms mixed in the city, and 
it can be readily appreciated that some precautions 
must be taken to render such milk harmless as a food. 

The common milk-born infections are typhoid 
fever, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and the organism

MiikBorne ^^^ epidemics of sore throat. All of these organisms 
Diseases are easily destroyed by heating for a short time at 
temperatures considerably below the boiling point of 
water, and several methods have been proposed and 
more or less widely adopted for such treatment of 
market milk. These processes are known as pasteuri- 
zation, after Pasteur, the famous French bacteriolo- 
gist, who first enunciated the principle upon which 
it rests. In some cases the milk is heated to a tem- 
perature of 170-180 degrees Fahrenheit for a period 
of ten minutes ; in others to 165 degrees for twenty 
minutes, and in still others at 140-145 degrees for 
thirty minutes. The higher the temperature the 
Pasteun- gj^Qj-^^j- ^j^g period required to destroy all those forms 
of organisms which may cause disease. The treat- 
ments just described are all capable of rendering milk 
safe for human consumption, but the tendency has 
been to adopt more and more the practice of heating 
to the lower temperatures and for the longer period, 
because the flavor of the milk is less altered by this 
method than by berating to higher temperatures. The 
taste is in all cases modified to some extent, but when 
the process is properly carried out, this is negligible. 

All milk which is derived from several farms 
which are not regularly and effectively inspected to

determine the health of the cows and the standards 
of cleanliness of the management, should be pasteur- 
ized as a health measure. Pasteurized milk is, so far 
as can be determined, the equivalent of fresh milk 
in its food value, except that it has lost in some meas- 
ure its power to protect against the development of 
scurvy. This is not a matter of any importance in ^^^p^^"^^^"^ 
the nutrition of adults who take an ordinary varied I'^e/Mnk'^" 
diet, but may be a serious matter in the feeding of 
an infant which is fed on cows' milk exclusively over 
a considerable period. The adult never lives exclu- 
sively on a milk diet except as a special therapeutic 
measure, and even then the juice of lemons or oranges 
is generally taken in fairly liberal amounts because 
it makes easier the drinking of milk in liberal amounts 
at frequent intervals. The citrous fruits are espe- 
cially good for supplying the antiscorbutic substance. 
When an infant is fed pasteurized milk it should 
always be given orange juice daily. This is discussed 
in greater detail in chapter II.

the subsequent accidental or intentional introduction

at high temperatures will generally not sour at all or 
sour so slowly that other types of decomposition mask 
it, and the milk spoils by unwholesome processes. 
Even the best pasteurized product will ordinarily sour 
more slowly than will raw milk, and this is an im- 
portant factor in determining the fitness of old milk 
which has been subjected to this treatment.

There are always found in milk a certain number 
of spores of bacteria of the type which cause the 
putrefaction of milk proteins, and unfortunately 
these are very resistant to heat and survive the pas- 
teurization process. When unheated milk is allowed 
to sour, the accumulation of lactic acid serves to de- 
press the growth of the organisms which would cause 
a rotting decomposition of the milk proteins. Clean 

Normal milk which has soured is therefore a wholesome food.

force the distributor to handle the product properly

tages from the standpoint of protecting the public 
against several diseases, the treatment also changes 
its bacterial content so as to make it especially neces- 
sary to safeguard it by proper care so as to prevent 
its becoming unwholesome. 

The slow souring of pasteurized milk gives an 
opportunity for the bacteria which form unwhole-

was delivered, but was promptly placed in an efficient 
refrigerator. 

The housewife should inquire of the health de- 
partment about the standards of the milk distributor 
whom she patronizes, and co-operate with this de- 
partment in securing for the city a first class milk 
supply. Too much importance should not be attached 
to the total bacterial count as a basis of judgment of 
the quality of milk and its fitness for food. A high 
count, if due solely to the presence of the normal sour- 
ing organisms in warm weather, may have little sig- 
nificance, although it calls for vigilance. It is the 
number of gas formers which is of greatest moment 
and the bacteriologist of the health department alone 
can determine when the condition of the market milk 
calls for criticism in many instances. 

Milk which contains excessive numbers of bacteria 
may be permissible as food for adults provided it is 
used in cookery and is boiled sufficiently to render 
it harmless. It is not so wholesome a food as fresh, 
clean milk, however, and any which is in a bad bac- 
teriological condition should never be used for chil- 
dren even when bottled, as it is dangerous. 

The human infant is so delicate that its health is 
put in jeopardy by feeding it any milk other than the 
freshest, cleanest and most wholesome that can be 
obtained. The indifference with which many people 
feed canned or stale milks to infants and young chil- 
dren is little short of criminal, and when sane advice 
by competent bacteriologists and medical men in the 
health departments is now almost everywhere to be 
freely had for the asking, such practices cannot be 
excused on the basis of ignorance. An excellent 
method of fulfilling the duties of good citizenship is 
to keep conversant with the reports of the health de- 
partment, and to co-operate with it in every way pos- 
sible to protect the health of the community. Vig-

ilance of the milk supply and of the inspection of 
water and foods by the proper authorities is a duty 
of every conscientious member of the community. 

CANNED MILK. Milk production cannot be 
regulated according to the demands of the season. 
There will always be a surplus at some seasons when 
enough is produced to supply the public during the 
part of the year when the flow is smallest. This sur- 
plus is taken care of principally through canning of 
partly evaporated milk. The canned milk industry 
serves the useful function of preservation for future 
use of a valuable food resource which would other- 
wise have to go for stock feeding or be wasted. 

Canned milks are of two classes : sweetened and 
unsweetened. Part of the water is removed by evap- 
oration, and this evaporated product is placed in cans 
and sealed with suitable "processing" or heating to 
render it sterile, or nearly so, to prevent spoilage. 
Such unsweetened canned milk is called evaporated 
milk. Condensed milk always designates a product 
which has been treated in the manner described and 
with the subsequent addition of sufficient cane sugar 
to aid in its preservation. Bacteria do not grow well 
in highly sweetened foods, a fact which forms the 
basis of preserving foods such as fruits, jellies, etc., 
by the addition of much sugar. It is necessary to 
heat unsweetened, canned milk to a higher tempera- 
ture and for a longer time to prevent subsequent bac- 
terial decomposition, than condensed milk which is 
partly preserved by sweetening. The sweetened 
product does not need to be sterile in order to keep 
until marketed, and as one would expect, there are 
some cans which are not in as good bacteriological 
condition as others. 

All canned milks have been heated sufficiently to 
alter their flavors. All have been heated much higher 
than the temperature employed in pasteurization. All 

88

heated milks have lost in great measure their power 
to prevent scurvy from developing, but this is not 
under ordinary conditions of living a matter of any 
importance for adults. It may become a matter of ^^.!)"^^.., 
great gravity in feeding soldiers during a siege, or in j^^^. p^gyent 
garrisons, or prisoners, when they are confined to a scurvy 
monotonous diet free from fresh fruits or vegetables. 
The latter supply the necessary protective substance 
for this purpose. 

Canned milks are not proper food for infants or 
young children. They may be used with safety and 
profit by adults where fresh milk cannot be obtained, 
and a large market is assured for them in such places. 
It cannot be denied that children have succeeded in 
growing up on such milks, but they are greatly jeop- 
ardized by being confined to them. Experienced 
baby specialists are all agreed that the bones of an 
infant do not as a rule develop normally when it is 
confined for a prolonged period to canned milk. The Mistaken 
administration of orange juice or other fresh fruit Weas About 
juice may prevent the development of scurvy, but q^j^^^^^ 
according to some specialists does not prevent rickets. Milk 
It is true that many will testify to the experience that 
an infant may do better for a time on sweetened 
canned milk than it previously did on fresh raw or 
pasteurized milk. The beneficial effects of such a 
change of diet are to be explained by the action of 
the large amount of sugar in the canned milk, which 
discourage the growth of some pernicious type of 
organism which was flourishing in the intestine of 
the infant and making it ill. This does not serve to 
establish that canned milk is a good and safe infant 
food. It would be much better where the physician 
desires to add sugar to the diet for this purpose, to 
add it to clean, fresh milk, certified if it is obtainable, 
and if not, to the best fresh pasteurized milk which 
can be had.

DRIED MILKS. What has been said of canned 
milks may probably also be said of ordinary dried 
milk, but too little experience is available in the use 
of the very best qualities of milk powders to warrant 
an expression of opinion regarding their value in in- 
fant feeding. There is much less heating in the most 
perfect processes for the preparation of high grade 
milk powders than in the canning of milks. The 
product prepared by the spray process appears to be 
superior to all others. The milk is first partly con- 
densed by distilling ofif moisture in a partial vacuum, 
and the concentrated solution of milk solids which 
results is sprayed in the form of fine droplets into a 
large chamber, which is thoroughly ventilated by a 
blast of warm air. This carries away the water con- 
tent of the milk almost instantaneously, and the 
solids of the milk fall in the form of a snowy powder. 
This redissolves readily in water and forms a "recon- 
stituted" milk which can scarcely be told from fresh 
milk. It is therefore vastly superior to canned milks 
in flavor, and forms a wholesome food with excellent 
keeping qualities. Conversion into the finest grade 
of powder forms the most satisfactory method of 
preserving milk which has been devised. 

BOTULISM. There is a kind of food poisoning 
which has fortunately not become common in the 
United States, but has occasionally occurred. It is 
much more frequently met with in Europe. It is 
due to the ingestion of the poisonous body formed in 
foods by the organism bacillus botulinus, and the con- 
dition which the poison produces is known as botul- 
ism. The name comes from the Latin word for sau- 
sage, because this article has been more frequently 
responsible for this type of poisoning than any other. 
Stale foods of any kind are liable to harbor this 
bacillus and its poison. It has been traced to canned 
beans, canned pork and beans and to stale chicken 

90 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

and other remnants of meat which have been made 
into sandwiches. The trouble is not due to the in- 
gestion of the organism itself, for it does not grow at 
body temperature, although it thrives at ordinary 
room temperatures. During growth it forms the 
poison, the ingestion of which produces a most seri- 
ous and frequently fatal intoxication. 

The botulinus organism cannot develop in the 
presence of air, and this fact together with its ina- 
bility to grow at body temperature doubtless accounts 
for its infrequent observation. The poison is easily sfaie Meats 
destroyed by heating to the temperature of boiling 
water, so that if an article of food were badly infected 
and highly toxic, it would no longer be dangerous 
if, as is usually the case, it were heated to boiling 
before serving. It may develop in the interior of a 
piece of meat but occurs most frequently in canned 
goods which have not been heated in processing for 
a sufficient length of time to kill its spores. It should 
be the invariable rule to heat all canned goods to 
boiling before serving. If this is done there is no 
danger whatever from this variety of food poisoning. 

CANNED GOODS. The practice of preserving 
food by sealing it in air tight cans and sterilizing by 
heat did not become common until the Civil War, 
but since then food canning has grown to be an enor- 
mous industry. There has been a tendency for many Suspicion 
years on the part of the public to be suspicious of of Canned 
the quality of canned foods. The most serious out- ^^^'^^ 
break of criticism arose during the Spanish-American 
war in connection with the beef supplied to the sol- 
diers in Cuba. The canned meat was apparently in 
good condition, and was pronounced wholesome by 
competent and unprejudiced scientists, but the boys 
came to dislike it, presumably because they were fed 
excessive amounts of meat, rich in fat, in a semi- 
tropical climate. As would be expected, they became 

91 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

disgusted at the sight of canned meat. The news- 
papers, championing the cause of the soldier, heralded 
the unpleasant appellation "embalmed beef" widely 
and helped to establish in the mind of the public a 
distrust of canned foods in general. Whenever there 
has occurred a case of food poisoning sufficiently 
Foods Are scrious to attract attention, suspicion has invariably 
Usually fallen on any canned article which has been recently 
Safe eaten. In many cases these suspicions have been un- 
founded, but occasionally there has occurred a case 
of poisoning from canned foods. 

Canned meats are probably safer in general than 
beef or fowl left over from a former repast and served 
when several days old as cold meat, or in the form of 
sandwiches. They are certainly much safer than 
sausages or hamburg steaks or than lobster. The 
latter spoils so readily that is is customary to market 
them alive, to be killed at the time their preparation 
for the table is begun. There is difficulty in keeping 
them alive in some cases, and it not infrequently 
happens that the dealer forces the purchaser to take 
some dead with living ones. The number of cases of 
poisoning from lobster has not been so great or so 
frequent as to cause undue alarm. It may be consid- 
ered in general a safe food provided ordinary care is 
exercised. Canned lobster is probably as safe as other 
canned meats, and the same may be said of other sea 
foods. 

From time to time the objection has been raised 
against canned foods that they are liable to contain 
dissolved tin from the can or lead from the solder. 
Such objections have not found much support from 
chemical analysis. It is true that acid fruits, and 
among the vegetables, especially asparagus, may dis- 
solve a considerable amount of tin, but the practice 
of using lacquered or enameled containers has in- 

92

creased to a considerable extent during recent years 
and minimizes this difficulty. 

RAW FOODS. The danger from the use of raw 
milk and sausage has been already discussed. It from Raw 
may be added that there are certain animal parasites, Meats 
the most important among which in temperate re- 
gions are trichina and tape worm, which enter the 
system only through the use of meats which are in- 
fested with the encysted larvae. Trichina comes 
from raw or under-cooked pork. It has been stated 
even in recent years that about six per cent of all 
hogs slaughtered harbor this parasite. It is especially 
dangerous since there is no effective cure for it once Trichina 
it enters the muscles. This the larvae do by pene- p**^*^ ^^^ 
trating the intestinal wall. The disease, in cases 
where the number of parasites which enter the tissues 
is small, is not fatal, but causes much suffering. 

Tapeworm is almost always derived from eating 
beef which is raw or under cooked. It, as well as 
trichina, can be entirely avoided by thorough cook- 
ing of the meat. There is a dwarf tapeworm which 
is parasitic in the hog and the rat, and food contam- Tapeworm 
inated by its eggs forms the source from which these ^*"^'" ^^^ 
animals become its hosts. These and a few other 
parasites which occasionally infest men are sufficient- 
ly common in animals which are used as food, so 
that it is very important that all food of this nature 
should be heated so thoroughly as to destroy the 
larvae. 

The belief is held by a few faddists that man 
would be better nourished if he ate only raw foods, j.^^^ ^^^ 
This subject needs little discussion for the practice Food Fad 
would greatly restrict the list of articles which could 
be eaten with safety. While some of the lower ani- 
mals can eat foods containing raw starch, most of 
these articles are not safe for man and produce indi- 
gestion if eaten freely. The starch granules are

individually wrapped in a paper-like cellulose mem- 
brane which is of such a nature that it is not dissolved 
by any of the digestive juices in the alimentary tract 
of man. Cooking causes the bursting of this mem- 
brane, and the setting free of the starch, which makes 
it possible for the digestive ferments to come into 
intimate contact with it. The flavors of various foods 
are markedly improved by cooking, and, without ex- 
ception, their digestibility as well. 

Almost all vegetables from the garden are eaten 
only after cooking. The most important exceptions 
are lettuce, tomato, celery, onion and radish. These, 
if thoroughly washed, are entirely safe, except in a 
few cases where the inexcusable practice is followed 
of fertilizing the ground with night soil. This prac- 
tice is very common in China, and may contaminate 
vegetables with the typhoid organism. For esthetic 
reasons, if for no other, the use of this method of 
fertilizing cannot be too strongly condemned. 

Fruits and berries are frequently eaten raw, and 
this is to be recommended when practicable. It has 
been stated that the substance in natural foods which 
prevents scurvy is the most easily destroyed con- 
stituent of our diet, and most cooked foods as well 
as those which have been sterilized by canning, or 
even subjected to the lesser degree of heat necessary 
for pasteurization, will be lacking in this dietary 
essential. There are probably a very few foods 
which can be heated or dried without complete loss 
of this substance. The tomato appears to be one of 
these. The best way to introduce this protective sub- 
stance into the diet is in such fruits as can be eaten 
raw with safety. Apples, pears, peaches, oranges, 
bananas and berries serve this purpose admirably. 
They are clean enough to eat when washed or peeled. 
The juice of the lemon or orange is apparently one of 
the best sources of the protective substance against

WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

scurvy. Berries need special care in washing because 
in many cases some or all of them are liable to have 
been in contact with the soil, on account of the low- 
ness of the vine, or the tendency of the canes to droop 
to the ground when loaded with fruit. They are not 
therefore so safe for children as fruits which are 
peeled. Nuts, being protected by a shell, are excep- 
tionally clean and suitable for eating raw. Their 
palatability is high, and they are very desirable for 
the sake of variety and palatability in the diet. They 
have the advantage that they need no preparation. 
All human foods, except the meats, fruits and nuts 
are of relatively low palatability. These few are 
therefore of special value for their appetizing qual- 
ities. 

REFRIGERATION OF FOOD IN THE 
HOME. Since all uncooked foods are more or less 
contaminated with bacteria, and all cooked foods 
readily become seeded with organisms from the air 
and handling, all will undergo decomposition if kept Keep a 
too long. The spoilage takes place slower at low S**^*^^ 
temperature than at high; hence the desirability of 
having a good refrigerator in the home for the 
preservation of food. Many refregerators and ice 
boxes are practically worthless because of faulty con- 
struction or lack of sufficient ice. A small ice box is 
frequently an expensive luxury, which wastes ice and â¢ 
fails to preserve food, while a big refrigerator is true 
economy. Many household refrigerators do not 
maintain a temperature below 55 to 58 degrees F. and 
at these temperatures most forms of bacteria continue 
to grow fairly rapidly. The temperature should be 
not higher than 45 degrees around the food. 

It never pays to buy less ice than the maximum 
which the refrigerator will hold. Ice melts faster if Economize 
the temperature is high than if it is low, so the greater on ice 
the amount of ice in the compartment, and the more

efficient the lowering of the temperature the greater 
the saving in the rate of melting as well as increased 
thoroughness in the cooling of the food. 

The refrigerator should be cleaned at least once 
a week. The water from melted ice should not be 
used for cool drinks, nor should it come into contact 
with food, unless the ice is frozen artificially and from 
boiled or distilled water. Natural ice frequently con- 
tains the germs of typhoid fever. 

Most refrigerators are so constructed that the 
water drips away as fast as it is formed, and while it 
is still nearly ice cold. Much of the refrigerating 
power of it is of course lost. The ice compartment 
should be a water tight box in which the water ac-

before the compartment is re-filled. The temperature 
of water in which ice is floating will be but a few 
degrees above the freezing point, and when milk is 
being kept for feeding an infant over a twenty-four 
hour period, the bottle should be immersed in this ice 
water, rather than allowed to stand in air beside a 
cake of ice, since it will be much colder in the water. 

SAFETY AND ESTHETIC STANDARDS IN 
FOOD. â Disease is mainly contracted through di- 
Esthetic rect contact with a diseased person or animal or with 
Standards [^^ secretions or excretions. Next in importance as 
^"i F^ ^d^ cause of disease is food which has become contamin- 
ated with bacteria. Lack of cleanliness in the home 
or surroundings is of much less importance in the 
dissemination of disease. The views regarding the 
relative importance of these factors have been com- 
pletely reversed within recent years. 

The discriminating part of the public now de- 
mands cleanliness in the handling of food and drink, 
and attractiveness in appearance and manner of serv-

WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

ing, wholly aside from any element of danger to 
health which may be involved in methods which do 
not meet with their approval. This appreciation of 
cleanliness, apart from the protection which it affords ^^^ Grading 
against infection, is a purely esthetic factor which has According 
greatly modified the handling of food by dealers. It to its 
is now common practice to demand single service cleanness 
packages in the serving of food in public eating places, 
and of package foods in the home. Laws have been 
enacted and enforced to prevent the exposure of foods 
to dust of the street or to insects. Bread must be 
wrapped if it is to find its way into many homes. 
Bottled water is purchased by many at great expense 
because of a highly developed sense of decency, and 
a demand for attractive appearance in food and drink. 

The classification of milk into A, B and C grades 
is a notable illustration of the demand of the public 
for a clean product, notwithstanding that all grades 
may be rendered comparatively safe for consumption 
by adults by means of pasteurization. People have 
come to appreciate milk which has been collected 
under hygienic conditions and are willing in many 
cases to pay an additional price for the assurance that 
their food has never been allowed to become 
contaminated at any time, irrespective of the fact that 
it may have been subsequently rendered entirely safe 
by heating. The demand for bottled water at a high 
price instead of city water which has been treated 
chemically in order to render it safe provided it may 
have been contaminated before treatment, illustrates 
the same tendency. 

Doubtless the instinct for cleanliness had its origin 
in a realization that a relation sometimes exists be- 
tween dirt, insects and disease, but it can be readily 
appreciated that the esthetic demands of the public, 
or at least a part of it, have gone far beyond the point 
where safety alone is involved.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS TO BE OB- 
SERVED IN THE FEEDING OF 
YOUNG CHILDREN 

'J'he unborn infant is nourished by the substances 
which circulate in the blood of the mother, although 
the mother's blood does not mix with that of the child. 
The nutrition of the child begins with the bej^inning 
of prenatal life, and the diet of the mother should be "^Â® 
such as will insure that her blood carries everythinji;' ,,"j|^. "" 
which is necessary for the nourishment of her unborn ynborn 
infant. It should likewise be such that her blood will 
carry as little as possible of foreign and obnoxious 
substances which are derived from bacterial de- 
composition of food in her digestive tract. In the 
light of all that we now know, this can best be ac- 
comi)lished by the mother adhering in great measure 
to a lacto-vegetarian diet, in which green vegetables 
are abundant. 

The pregnant woman should understand that she 
should not be over abstemious. Neither should she feel 
that she should eat more than her appetite calls for. 
The additional demand on her nutrition at this time 
is not so great as might ai)pear on first thought. The 
formation of a seven j)ound baby, about three-fourths 
of whose weight is water, demands, during a period 
of nine months but little daily contribution of food 
material from the mother. The most im])ortant con- 
sideration is to furnish the fleveloping child with the 
right kinds of substances for its growth. This is best 
accomplished by a diet which best promotes the health 
of the mother. 

Every baby should be nursed by its mother. This 
is the only natural method of feeding an infant. An 
eminent pediatritian, Dr. Schlossmann, has aptly

termed bottle feeding "unnatural," and experience 
amply justifies the use of this harsh word instead of 
the better-sounding common term "artificial" feed- 
ing. In 1901 Westergaard presented statistics which 
show that the mortality of infants fed on cows' milk 
is from five to ten times greater than among those fed 
on mothers' milk. 

The character of the diet of the mother is a factor 
of the greatest importance for the production of an 
adequate supply of milk of good quality. In the 
Philippine Islands, among mothers who live on very 
poor diets largely vegetable, the loss of infants is 
much higher when they are nursed than when they 
are fed on cows' milk. Yet in this tropical climate the 
mortality among "unnaturally" fed babies is much 
greater than it is among babies fed cows' milk in the 
United States, because of lack of care in the handling 
of the milk, and consequent bad bacteriological con- 
dition. The best diet for the nursing mother is a milk 
and vegetable diet in which lettuce, spinach, cabbage, 
Brussels sprouts, chard, collards, turnip greens or 
other leafy vegetables and fruits are abundant. Meat 
should be eaten but sparingly, but should be used in 
cookery to confer palatability on the vegetable foods. 

There is good reason to believe that the common 
practice of deriving too large a part of the diet from 
meat, bread, sugar, potatoes, breakfast cereals, peas 
and beans is in no small measure responsible for the 
failure of many mothers to produce milk of satis- 
factory quantity and quality for the nutrition of their 
infants. There is no hardship in restriction of the 
intake of meat and increasing the consumption of 
milk and the green vegetables, and the mother who 
does so will greatly minimize the danger of a break 
in the healthy growth of her baby. 

When it is absolutely necessary to feed a baby on 
something other than the mother's milk the first

choice of substitutes is the milk of the goat. Many 
persons in large cities cannot readily keep a goat for 
this purpose, but in villages or on farms it is always 
easy to do so. The goat does not suffer from 
tuberculosis as does the cow. It has been estimated 
that at least ten per cent of all dairy cows in the 
United States are infected with this disease, and it is 
readily transmitted to a young infant through the 
milk if it is fed raw. When pasteurized milk is used 
there is no danger from this source, but pasteurized 
milk is not so satisfactory for an infant as is raw milk. 
It is vastly superior to the average raw milk which 
is sold in cities, however, and should always be 
selected instead of the latter unless certified milk is 
procured. 

When a goat is kept for an infant, doubtless the 
best method of feeding is to apply the child directly to 
the nipple of the animal and let it suck. In this way 
it will get its milk free from bacteria. The nipple 
should be carefully washed with several portions of 
boiled water; not several times with the same water. 
If this method is not followed, the goat should be 
milked immediately before each feeding. The milk- 
ing should be done directly into the bottle from which Bottle 
the child is to be fed. The bottle should be washed 
thoroughly with warm water and soap after use and 
well rinsed with boiled water. Special care should 
be taken to keep the nipple clean by forcing warm, 
soapy water through it. Do not use the same dish 
mop for washing baby's bottle that is used for the 
family dishes. Have a special one for this purpose 
and rinse it free from soapy water after use. Hang 
it where flies cannot reach it when not in use and do 
not lay it in the kitchen sink or on the kitchen table. 

After goat's milk, fresh pasteurized milk from the 
cow forms the best food which is usually available for 
an infant. If the cost is not prohibitive it is best to

purchase certified milk for a baby during the first year 
and a half of its life. Certified milk is milk which has 
been obtained from cows which are carefully in- 
spected at frequent intervals and are known to be 
free from disease; the standard of cleanliness in the 
barn is known to be high and the health of the milkers 
is carefully watched. When cows' milk is fed to an 
infant it is best to skim off half of the cream. 

It is of the greatest importance to keep baby's 
milk as cold as possible from the moment it is de- 
livered at the door until it is used. The most efficient 
way to do this is to have an ice box in which the ice 
is kept in a deep pan in which the water from the 
melting ice accumulates. The bottle of milk sub- 
merged partly in this water containing a piece of ice 
will be many degrees colder than it would be in an 
ordinary refrigerator, even when standing beside 
the ice. 

When pasteurized milk is employed in infant feed- 
ing the child should be given a teaspoonful of orange 
juice daily after it is a month old. The amount should 
be increased gradually as the child grows older. At 
three or four months it should have a tablespoonful 
daily. 

At a meeting of baby specialists in 1917 the sub- 
ject of feeding green vegetables was thoroughly dis- 
cussed. The fact was brought out that the practice 
of giving infants well cooked spinach when their 
nutritive condition is below normal, has been widely 
adopted and with excellent results. The fact was 
emphasized that the spinach should be steamed rather 
than boiled since it loses less mineral salts in steam- 
ing. It should never be fed without being rubbed 
through a sieve to break it up finely and to remove all 
coarse particles. Feeding spinach may be begun at 
the age of six months. A tablespoonful a day may be 
given at this age and the amount may be increased 

102 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

to double this amount at nine or ten months and to 
three spoonfuls after the child is a year old. Orange 
juice should be continued with the spinach. 

The practice of feeding infants sweetened evapor- 
ated milk has grown enormously during recent years 
and has done incalculable damage to many thousands. Canned 
Canned milks are not fit food for infants and should be Milk Not 
used only when nothing else is available and then for ^^^^^ 
as short a time as possible. The bones do not develop peg^^ng 
normally on this food and physical weakness and low 
vitality in later life is almost sure to result. The 
death rate of infants is universally admitted to be ab- 
normally high where they are restricted to canned 
milk. No expense or trouble should be spared to 
obtain fresh, raw or pasteurized cow's or fresh goat's 
milk when nursing is impossible. 

The proper time to wean baby is when it is about 
a year old. At first it may be given cow's milk from 
a bottle, but it is not best to allow it to suck a nipple 
after baby is two years old. Half the feedings should Feeding 
be given from a bottle at first and the nursing contin- just After 
ued so as to wean it gradually. The milk which is fed Weaning 
to a young child should be warmed to body tempera- 
ture. About three tablespoonfuls of spinach should be 
continued daily after weaning. One or two table- 
spoonfuls of thoroughly cooked cereal, slightly salted, 
should be added to the milk daily and may be given at 
the times when the spinach is not fed. Baby should 
be given a piece of crisp toast or zwiebeck to chew 
once a day. Milk should remain the principal constit- 
uent of the diet and orange juice should be given 
regularly. An egg yolk may be given every other day 
instead of the spinach or the cereal, but one of these 
should be allowed every day. 

On such a dietary plan an infant which is given 
boiled water several times a day, and which is allowed 
sufficient sleep, will nearly always thrive. If it is not

THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

Let Baby growing, consult a doctor. Many babies are fretful 
to Sleep because they are handled so much that they do not 
get enough rest. It is wrong to entertain a baby 
more than a few minutes at a time. It should be 
taught from its earliest infancy to remain alone in 
a quiet room the greater part of the time. 

Do not give baby meat, tea or coffee, or sweet 
foods. These may not make it ill, but they pervert 
the appetite for the things which are best for it. Great 
care should be taken to cultivate during the first few 
years a liking for wholesome foods. 

After two years baby can be given more cereal,

Tomato juice free from seeds is perfectly safe during

be planned around this necessary staple. They may

not necessary to deny them an occasional sweet des- 
sert, and they may well be given candy or sugar, but 
always in small amounts and with a meal rather than 
after it. 

104 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 



Children should be trained to like all j^reen vege- 
tables, and a daily serving of carrots, turnips, rad- 
ishes or other products of the garden is advisable. 
Fruit may be offered as a lunch between meals when 
convenient rather than starchy or sweet foods, be- 
cause they leave the teeth freer from adhering matter 
which promotes decay. 

The main principle to be ke])t in mind in the feed- 
ing of growing children is that they should not be 
allowed to form the habit of deriving too large a part 
of their diet from meat, bread, potatoes, sugar and 
breakfast cereals. This mistake is now being fre- 
quently made in many otherwise well managed homes 
and the reports of the physical condition of the school 
children in many cities reflect its effects. Plain food 
should be chosen which is not so appetizing or habit- 
forming as to encourage over eating, but which meets 
all of the requirements of a well balanced food sup- 
ply and which will not lead to the development of an 
unfavorable type of bacterial population in the intes- 
tine. Constant use of milk of good quality, l)read, 
potatoes, cereals, fruits and abundant leafy vegetables 
fulfill these requirements. 

HARD FOODS HELP TO MAKE GOOD 
TEETH. The importance of furnishing something 
hard to chew on from early infancy is very great. 
Toast serves this purpose admirably during the first 
two years. After that time apples, crackers, hard 
bread, raw cabbage chopped as fine as possible with a 
meat chopper, cooked vegetables, lettuce, celery, etc., 
serve to develop the teeth. Children must be watched 
to see that they do not swallow their food without 
chewing. Too many children are allowed to grow up 
on soft foods. When we chew fibrous foods we exert 
a pressure of one hundred to two hundred and fifty 
pounds pressure on the teeth, and this insures a good 
circulation of blood in the inner part, and is a most

important factor in developing the teeth and jaws. 
The freedom from decay of the teeth among primi- 
tive peoples may be in some measure attributable to 
the necessity for vigorous efforts of the teeth made 
necessary by the tough meats, hard grains, fibrous 
fruits and vegetables w^hich furnish their food supply. 
Of 10,500 school children in England and Scot- 
land, 86 per cent had decayed teeth. Among 19,725 
children in northern Germany the percentage show- 
ing diseased teeth was 96. In a group of 3236 children 
Prevalence in Philadelphia, between the ages of 7 and 14 years, 
of Decayed 7^763 decayed permanent teeth were found. In Seat- 
^^^ tie, the histories of over 1100 children showed that 
42.6 per cent which had been nursed at least six 
months; 42.9 per cent of those which had been nursed 
less than six months and were then fed cows' milk, 
and 72.1 per cent of those which were fed in infancy 
on sweetened condensed milk, had decayed teeth. 
Similar results have been observed in other places. 

It has been commonly supposed in the past that 
the chewing of hard foods was solely responsible for 
the development of good teeth in savage peoples. It 
does have much to do with it, but all primitive peo- 
^^^J-^^h-^^ pies do not have good teeth. Marshall has pointed 
out that the teeth of meat eaters and of vegetarians 
are equally liable to decay. It seems that one of the 
most important factors in producing teeth of poor 
quality which early become infected, and which is 
now so common depends on the practice which is 
now widespread, of deriving too large a portion of 
the diet from muscle meats, modern milling products 
of cereal grains, and tubers. Such a diet is deficient 
in several respects, and the nature of these have been 
discussed already. According to this view the low 
vitality and inferiority of the teeth is but one mani- 
festation among many of poor physical development. 
Certainly our standards of physical stamina are fairly

low, as is shown by the large number of young men 
who pass in every day life as normal, but who were 
found unfit for military service. Eating soft foods, 
which give the teeth no exercise; constant presence of 
pasty starchy deposits on the teeth and faulty selec- 
tion of food doubtless all combine to produce the 
serious condition which now prevails. 

Both for children and adults it is of importance 
that the last article eaten should be of such a nature ./^^l*J^.^!!

as to cleanse the teeth, bticky pastries, cake and Fruits 
other carbohydrate foods tend to remain in the fis- 
sures of the teeth and are not easily removed by the 
tooth-brush. Carbohydrate residues tend to favor 
decay more than do meat particles. It would be best 
to eat a salad, cole slaw, celery, apple or other fibrous 
food at the end of the meal, since they tend not only 
to cleanse the teeth but exert a detergent action on 
dental caries. Acid fruits are doubtless best for this 
purpose because they stimulate the secretion of a 
strongly alkaline saliva which coats the teeth and 
preserves them from being etched by the decomposi- 
tion products of the food residues which would other- 
wise remain.

than a high grade soap and water. The last saliva

so extreme as to amount to a craving, as it would be 
to form in them the habit of craving coffee, tea or 
alcohol. They lose thereby the ability to appreciate 
the natural flavors of wholesome foods and this mili- 
tates against their taking a diet which is satisfactory, 
and this leads to faulty nutrition with all its train of 
consequences.

relates to the preservation of the teeth, can be fol-

which will be reaped in a diminished patronage of the

PART II 

Remarks on the Menus 

It is best to serve small portions of meat, and then 
if desired let each member of the family ask for a 
second helping. This will aid in reducing the con- 
sumption of meat where the individual is desirous of 
doing so. 

Observe that ample provision is made for utiliz- 
ing left-overs in succeeding menus. This ever pres- 
ent problem can be easily solved. The frequent ap- 
pearance of cream soups, gravies, salads and scalloped 
dishes provides the way to introduce these into the 
succeeding meal in an attractive form. Dry bread 
is used in the scalloped dishes, puddings or stuffings. 
Home made ice cream is preferable for children 
because the wholesomeness of all the ingredients of 
which it is composed can be counted upon. 

In these menus the word fry has been used in the 
usual American sense rather than saute. 

These menus have been planned without regard 
to rigid economy, except in respect to the work re- 
quired in serving them. None are of such a nature 
as to require an expenditure of money greater than is 
usual in the average home, provided the meat con- 
sumption is kept down as far as is recommended. 
Good food is not cheap at the present time and food 
must be one of the principal items in the family 
budget. The last place to economize is on the food 
supply when that economy necessitates the consump- 
tion of a poorly constituted diet. The value of good 
food can be estimated only in terms of health and 
efficiency. 

Occasional menus are given which are faulty in 
one or more respects, and which serve to illustrate the 
kinds of mistakes which are commonly made in the 

109 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

selection of food in many households. These are in- 
cluded in order to bring home to the attention how 
easily a simple modification of an unsatisfactory meal 
may make it of good quality for the maintenance of 
health. 

It is preferable to use custards, puddings, cream 
pies or fruit for dessert rather than fruit pies. 

Although receipts have been included for some of 
the dishes for the convenience of the housewife, there 
are many details for which she will have to rely on 
a standard cook book. The few directions given are 
not expected to take the place of a manual of cook- 
ery. It is expected that the great majority of women 
who make use of these menus will possess a consid- 
erable knowledge of this art. 

Such decisions as the choice of French dressing, 
boiled dressing or mayonaise dressing, must be left 
to the individual, and will depend on the family pref- 
erence. 

In many instances a dislike for milk is not due to 
an actual sensitization toward the food, but to an 
aversion resulting from having taken at some time 
milk which had a bad flavor. The memory of such 
an experience may persist for a long time. If tainted 
milk is responsible for the dislike of it as a beverage, 
it can frequently be taken concealed in cooked foods. 

There are a few persons who are sensitive toward 
certain foods such as milk, eggs, strawberries, toma- 
toes, almonds or oatmeal, and are made ill by eating 
them. These always present a special problem. It 
has been found possible in some cases to relieve the 
condition, through the administration by a physician 
at frequent intervals, of very small doses of the pro- 
teins of the food which causes illness. They must 
not be given the offending food. 

The information concerning nutrition contained 
in the preceding chapters should be possessed by all 

110 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

the members of the family. Since they will probably 
not secure this for themselves, the mother should im- 
part it verbally, as part of the table conversation on 
suitable occasions. 

In selecting lettuce it is best to buy well formed 
heads. Rain spatters particles of soil on garden vege- 
tables, and the inner leaves of lettuce and cabbage 
are cleaner than the outer ones. The latter may be 
discarded when these are eaten raw in salads. 

The most suitable foods for consumption in the 
raw state are the fruits and nuts which are peeled 
or shelled before being served. Lettuce, cabbage and 
other green vegetables need to be washed with spe- 
cial care when they are to be eaten raw, because they 
have been in contact with the soil. This applies also 
especially to strawberries, which in many instances 
have lain in contact with the ground. 

A simple bread and milk supper was once com- 
mon in rural American homes. It is highly satis- 
factory from the standpoint of nutrition, and almost 
eliminates labor in its serving. It is a good policy 
to serve one occasionally. 

The appetite is not a safe guide in the selection 
of food. The teachings of science are just as reliable 
in dictating what we shall eat as they are in the reg- 
ulation of the composition of formulas in manufactur- 
ing processes. It is sound practice to prescribe what 
people shall eat, just as it is to prescribe what med- 
icines they shall take when ill. If people do not like 
wholesome foods because of habits formed in early 
life, they should learn to like them. Some will not 
listen to advice regarding diet, but wholesome advice 
should be sweetly given them, so that if they persist 
in ignoring sound principles, they will do so with 
their eyes open. 

The proper remedy for increasing plumpness and 
expanding waistband is not the elimination of starchy 

111 



THE AMERICAN HOME DIET, OR 

and fatty foods from the diet, but exercise and re- 
striction of the appetite, with frequent consultation 
of the scales. Always take a diet which is physiolog- 
ically complete, rather than one confined to meat and 
green vegetables on which one cannot grow fat even 
when eating to excess. 

The proper feeding of a group of people should 
not be regarded as simply a menial task, but as a 
public health enterprise. Successful feeding of the 
family means the application of modern knowledge 
to the planning of the diet, and makes it a profession 
in the field of preventive medicine rather than a busi- 
ness. 

Ask your city health officer whether the dealer 
from whom you buy your ice cream uses fresh milk 
and cream in its manufacture, or whether he uses stale 
products which have become unfit for marketing in 
the unfrozen state. Frozen milk and cream, masked 
with flavoring materials, cannot be judged as to their 
quality by the sense of taste. Some commercial ice 
cream is not wholesome, as is shown by an occasional 
outbreak of food poisoning following its consumption. 
Your health department should be able to advise you 
concerning the standards of your dealer. 

If you see at cat sleeping in your grocer's window 
with a fruit exhibit, tell him he will lose your patron- 
age if it occurs again. This is the way in which stand- 
ards are improved. 

It is better to buy wrapped bread when you get 
it from a wagon, rather than an unwrapped loaf 
which has been handled by several pairs of hands, 
and has been exposed to the dust of the street. If 
you visit the baker's shop this is not necessary. 

Never hesitate to tell your food dealers that you 
do not like to see flies having access to the foods 

112 



WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER? 

which they sell. It helps to promote good health 
propaganda. If necessary, tell them where flies come 
from. 

Never allow flies in your kitchen. Remember that 
flies come from filth, like to visit filth, are carriers 
of disease, and will contaminate food. 

Always boil the water for the baby, and for all 
the family when there is a case of typhoid fever in 
the neighborhood. 

It is better to cultivate the habit of not using sugar 
on breakfast cereals.

These lunches illustrate a type of menu which is unfortunately 
fairly common in American homes. They represent the meat, bread 
and potato type of diet or its equivalent. Both bread and potatoes 
have similar dietary properties to other seed products such as rice, 
corn, peas, beans, etc., and the extension of variety in the menu by 
the addition of these, or by the inclusion of macaroni, spaghetti, 
sweet potatoes, radishes, turnips, beets or carrots fails to improve 
the meal to any great extent. They are presented here as examples 
of typical faulty diets. An understanding of the general principles of 
the selection of foods on a scientific basis makes it easy to interpret 
the nature of their faults. They are examples of what not to serve.

in palatability or attractiveness, yet they are so constituted as to meet 
the needs of the body, while the ones opposite will not. There is no 
appreciable difference in the amount of labor required for their prepa- 
ration. The menus for the year which are presented in this book 
are planned to avoid just such mistakes as the housewife is liable to 
make who does not understand the peculiar properties of the foods 
she buys, and who relies entirely on the acceptability of the foods 
which she provides for her family.

The above menus illustrate errors which are frequently made in 
the planning of dinners. They represent the meat, bread and potato 
type of diet, and are not satisfactory for the promotion of health 
when adhered to over a considerable period. Fortunately, few adhere 
regularly to diet which is quite so bad as those described, but meals 
of this type cannot be regarded as satisfactory even when occasion- 
ally somewhat improved by the addition of small amounts of the 
protective foods, milk, and the leafy vegetables. Below is a series of 
menus which illustrate how simple it is to modify this kind of din- 
ner so as to make it decidedly more satisfactory for the promotion 
of health.

The above described dinners furnish a leafy vegetable, and in 
addition there are two dishes in which milk forms an important con- 
stituent. These additions correct the faults from the dietary stand- 
point, and make the diet complete. Each meal provides the mate- 
rials which circulate in the tissues of the body during several hours, 
and provide them w'ith the wherewithall to grow or to repair them- 
selves. It is important that each meal shall be planned so as to 
provide everything that the body needs, and in as nearly the right 
proportions as possible. The menus in this book comply with the 
requirements of modern scientific research in the field of nutrition.

RECIPES 

Some of the recipes in the following -pages have been taken with permission from the 
Boston Cooking School Cook Book, by Fannie M. Farmer; and the New Cookery, by 
Lenna Cooper. These and other standard books on cookery may be consulted for fur- 
ther details. 



SOUPS, CHOWDERS, ETC. 

Cream soups are made of vege- 
tables with milk and seasonings. 
They are always slightly thickened. 
A general formula for the white 
sauce to be used for crearn soups 
follows : 

1 cup milk 

2 tablespoons flour 
2 tablespoons butter 

H teaspoon salt 

The vegetable, for example celery, 
is usually cut in small pieces and 
cooked in a small amount of water. 
It is then mashed and strained into 
the white sauce. Any left-over veg- 
etable as potatoes, peas, corn, celery, 
spinach or tomatoes, can be used in 
this way. Some prefer the addition 
of an onion to nearly all creamed 
soups. This has to be left to indi- 
vidual tastes. For a detailed discus- 
sion of cream soups see a good cook 
book, as The Boston Cooking School 
Cook Book. 

The above formula is also used for 
creamed vegetables as peas, carrots, 
potatoes, etc., and for meats and fish, 
as creamed ham, dried beef, tuna 
fish, etc. If one prefers a thicker 
sauce more flour is added. 

Croutons 

Spread stale bread thinly with but- 
ter, remove crusts, cut in one-third 
inch cubes, put in pan and bake un- 
til brown or fry in deep fat. 

Vegetable Soup.

2 oxtails

hours. Add vegetables and cook iH 
hours longer. Add more water when 
necessary. 

Oyster Stew. 

1 quart oysters 

4 cups scalded milk 
yl cup butter 

2 teaspoons salt 
yi teaspoon pepper

fully. Heat liquor to boiling^ point, 
strain, add oysters and cook until 
oysters are plump and edges begin 
to curl. Add scalded milk, butter, 
salt and pepper. Serve with oyster 
crackers or saltines. 

Corn Chowder. 

1 can corn 

4 cups potatoes cut in 

14 inch slices 
1^ inch cube of fat

1 sliced onion

8 crackers 

3 tablespoons butter 
Salt and pepper 

Cut pork into small pieces and try 
out; add onion and cook five min- 
utes. Strain fat into stewpan. Par- 
boil potatoes 5 minutes, drain. Add 
potatoes to fat. Then add 2 cup.'=

BEVERAGES. 
Chocolate. 

Melt Yi pound chocolate in double 
boiler, add V/2 cup sugar, and about 1

a thick syrup. Pour into a jar for fu- 
ture use. When you want to make 
chocolate heat the milk and to each 
pint of milk add 2 teaspoons of 
above mixture. It is very easily 
and quickly prepared. The amount 
of water and sugar to be added to 
the melted chocolate varies a little 
with the brand of chocolate used. 
The amount of sugar also depends 
upon individual tastes. 

Cocoa is cheaper than chocolate, 
so we have included it in the menus

feel, however, that chocolate made 
according to the above rule is much 



easier to prepare than cocoa, but this 
is an individual matter which a 
housewife must decide for herself.
