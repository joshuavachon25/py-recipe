This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF DOMESTIC ECONOMY 



IN ENGLISH 

PREFACE 

The aim of this bibliography is to include all bound books on domestic 
economy published in the Engh'sh language between 1850 and 1899 
inclusive. Pamphlets are as a rule omitted, and likewise all entries 
listed at loc or less in American, and 6d or less in English money. No 
attempt has been made to include analytic or magazine references, a 
limitation barring government documents in which much useful material 
may be found. Of periodicals dealing chiefly with subjects in domestic 
economy only current magazines and journals find place in the list, or 
those which have been met with in catalogues or bibliographies. Lists 
of earlier ones may be found in the newspaper guides cited among the 
bibliographic aids. 

The term " domestic economy " has been taken in the narrower sense 
of the management of house and children, together with the teaching 
of domestic economy and cookery thus covering the same ground as 
subject number 640 of the Decimal classification. With few exceptions, 
material is arranged by the following tentative scheme proposed for the 
seventh (20th century) edition of the Decimal classification; though 
many heads, specially under 643-645 fall outside the scope of this bibliog- 
raphy. 

Call numbers are given for books in the New York state library, 

but not for those in the public libraries division. Books marked e have 

been personally examined, while e means that the edition given is different 

from the one examined; the best books are starred. Bost. Sal. Wor. at 

the end of entries stand for Boston, Salem, Worcester public libraries ; 

N. Y. for N. Y. state library.
