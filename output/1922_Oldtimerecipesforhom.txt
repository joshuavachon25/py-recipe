INTRODUCTION 

The idea of compiling this little volume 
occurred to me while on a visit to some 
friends at their sunmier home in a quaint 
New England village. The little town had 
once been a thriving seaport, but now con- 
sisted of hardly more than a dozen old- 
fashioned Colonial houses facing each other 
along one broad, well-kept street. A few 
blind lanes led to less pretentious homes; 
and still farther back farmhouses dotted the 
landscape and broke the dead line of the 
horizon. 

For peace, contentment, and quiet seren- 
ity of life, this little village might have 
been Arcadia; the surrounding country, the 
land of Beulah.

servant who brought in the refreshing Or- 
geat and delicate seed cakes P Have not our 
own grandmothers boasted of the delicious 
flavor of old English Cowslip wine or Noyean 
Cordial? 

I have confined myself exclusively to home- 
made beverages, gathering my fruits and 
flowers from old-fashioned, homely gardens. 
I leave to your imagination the times, fash- 
ions, and customs they recall. The aroma 
that clings to them is subtle. Age has 
blended and mellowed all that was crude in 
those bygone days. 

With a gentle hand I tie my little bunch 
together and pres^it you my bouquet. 



The best method of making these wines 
is to boil the ingredients, and ferment with 
yeast. Boiling makes the wine more soft and 
mellow. Some, however, mix the juice, or 
juice and fruit, with sugar and water un- 
boiled, and leave the ingredients to ferment 
spontaneously. Your fruit should always be 
prime, and gathered dry, and picked clean 
from stalks, etc. The lees of wine are valu- 
able for distillation, or making vinegar.. 
When wine is put in the cask the fermenta- 
tion will be renewed. Clear away the yeast 
as it rises, and fill up with wine, for which 
purpose a small quantity should be reserved. 
If brandy is to be added, it must be when 
the fermentation has nearly subsided, that 
is, when no more yeast is thrown up at the 
bimg-hole, and when the hissing noise is not 
very perceptible; then mix a quart of 
brandy with a pound of honey, pour into 
the cask, and paste stiff brown paper over 



%oqie Jgatfg eenneg 

Xhe bong^iole. AUov no hole for a vent peg, ' 
lest it should once be forgotten, and the whole 
calk of wine be spoiled. If the wine wants 
vent it will be sure to buxgt the paper; if 
not the paper will suffieiMiiily exclude the 
air. Once a week or so itmaj be looked to; 
if the paper is bunt, rraiew it, and continue 
to do so until i^ remains clear and dry. 

A great diffdretice of opinion prevails as 
to racking the wine, or Offering it to re- 
main on the lees. Those who adopt the for- 
mer plan do it at the end of six months ; 
draw off the wine perfectly clear, and put 
it into a fresh cask, in which it is to remain 
six months, and ^^ be bottled. If this ^aa' 
is adopted, /it~nitty. be.' better, ibstead of ^ill- 
ting the brandy and honeylh the ^st i^isk, 
to put it in that'ih which thpTpsf itf to te ' 
racked; but on the whole, itia,^p^:rihilps, pr^ 
erable to leave the wirie ^ .year ^ m &al •

COLORING FOR WINES 

One pound of white sugar. Put intoiui' 
iron kettle, let boil^ and bum to a red black, 
and thick; remore {rom the fire, and add a 
little hot water, to keep it from hardening 
as it cools; then bottle for use. 

FINING OR CLEARING 

For fining or clefl^^ the wine use one 
quarter pound of isinglass, dissolved in a 
portion of the wine, to a barrel. This must 
be put in after the fermentation is over, and 
sbould be added gentjy at the. bung-hole, and 
managed so as t<9 spread as much as possible 
oyer the upper sitrfa'ce of the liquid ; the 
intei^oB being, that the isinglass should 
unite with impurities and carry them with 
it to the bottom.' ""'n 

■ 

TO FLAVOR WINE 

When the- vinous fermentation is about 
half-over, the flavoring ingredients are to be 
put into the vat and well stirred into the 
contents. If almonds form a component 
part, they are first to be beaten to a paste 
and mixed with a pint or two of the must. 
Nutmegs, cinnamon, ginger, seeds, etc., 
should, before they are put into the vat, be

reduced to powder, and mixed with some of 
the must. 

TO MELLOW WINE 

Wine, either in bottle or wood, will mel- 
low much quicker when only covered with 
pieces of bladder well secured, than with 
corks or bun^. The bladder allows the wat- 
ery particles to escape, but is impervious to 
alcohol. 

TO REMOVE THE TASTE OF THE 
CASK FROM WINE 

Finest oil of olives, one pound. Put it 
into the hogshead, bung close, and roll it 
about, or otherwise well agitate it, for three 
or four hours, then gib, and allow it to 
settle. The ohve oil will gradually rise 
to the top and carry the ill flavor with it. 

TO REMOVE ROPINESS FROM WINE 

Add a little catechu or a small quantity 
of the bruised berries of the mountain ash. 

TO RESTORE WINE WHEN SOUR 
OR SHARP 

1. Fill a bag with leek-seed, or of leaves 
or twisters of vine, and put rither of them 
to infuse in the cask. 




Ti^oitif i^atre 2Slftif0 

'2. Put a small quantity of powdered char- 
coal in the wine, shake it, and after it has 
remained still for forty-eight hours, decant 
steadily. 

TO MAKE APPLE WINE 

To every gallon of apple juice, immedi- 
ately as it comes from the press, add two 
pounds of common loaf sugar; boil it as 
long as any scum rises, then strain it through 
a sieve, and let it cool. Add some good yeast, 
and stir it well. Let it work in the tub for 
two or three weeks, or till the head begins 
to flatten; then skim off the head, drain it 
clear off and tun it. When made a year, 
rack it off and fine it with isinglass; then 
add one-half pint of the best rectified spirit 
of wine or a pint of French brandy to every 
eight gallons. 

APRICOCK WINE 

Take three pounds of sugar, and three 
quarts of water ; let them boil together and 
skim it well. Then put in six pounds of 
apricocks, pared and stoned, and let them 
boil until they ar^ tender; then take them 
up and when the liquor is cold bottle it up. 
You may if you please, after you have taken 
out the apricocks, let the liquor have one 

19 



c;. . 



m^tnat iglftlTf WLiatn 

boil with a sprig of flowered clary in it; 
the apricocks make marmalade, and are very 
good for preserves. 

BALM WINE 

Take ten pounds of sugar, six quarts of 
water, boil it gently for two hours; skim it 
well and put it into a tub to cool. Take 
three-quarters pound of the tops of balm, 
bruise them, and put them into a barrel with 
a little new yeast, and wh^i the liquor is 
cold, pour it on the balm. Stir it well to- 
gether, and let it stand twenty-four hours, 
stirring it often. Then close it up and let 
it stand six weeks. Then rack it off and 
put a lump of sugar into every bottle. Cork 
it well, and it will be better the second year 
tlj^mi the first. 

_ TO MAKE BARLEY WINE 

. .^ake one-half pound of French barley and 
%o^ it in three waters, and save three pints 
of the last water, and mix it with one quart 
of white wine, one-half pint of borage water, 
as much clary water, a little red rose-water, 
the juice of five or six lemons, three-quarters 
poimd of fine sugar, the thin yellow rind of 
a lemon. Brew all these quick together, run 
it through a strainer, and bottle it up. It 

20 



'*» .V- 






IB^onu JUglre Wiintu 

is pleasant in hot weather, and very good 
in fevers. 

TO MAKE BEER AND ALE FROM 

PEA-SHELLS 

Fill a boiler with green shells of peas, pour 
on water till it rises half an inch above the 
shells, and sinuner for three hours. Strain 
off the liquor, and add a strong decoction 
of wood-sage, or hops, so as to render it 
pleasantly bitter; ferment with yeast, and 
bottle. 

BIRCH WINE 

The liquor of the birch-tree is to be ob- 
tained in the month of March, whai the sap 
begins to ascend. One foot from the ground 
bore a hole in each tree, large enough to 
admit a faucet, and set a vessel under; thit 
liquor will run for two or three days without 
hurting the tree. Having obtained a sttf- 
cient quantity, stop the holes with pegs. To 
each gallon of the Uquor add one quart of. - 
honey, or two and one-half pounds of sugar. 
Boil together one hour, stirring it well. A 
few cloves may be added for flavor, or the 
rind of a lemon or two; and by all means 
one ounce of hops to four and one-half gal- 
lons of wine. 

Work it with yeast, tun, and refine with 

21

isinglass. Two months after making, it may 
be drawn off and bottled, and in two months 
more will be fit for use, but will improve by 
keeping. 

BLACKBERRY WINE 

Bruise the berries well with the hands. To 
one gallon of fruit, add one-half gallon of 
water, and let stand overnight. Strain and 
measure, and to each gallon of juice add 
two and one-half pounds of sugar. Put in 
cask and let ferment. Tack thin muslin over 
top, and when fermentation stops, pour into 
jugs or kegs. Wine keeps best in kegs. 

BLACKBERRY WINE 

(OTHBE METHODS OF MAKING) 

1. Having procured berries that are fully 
ripe, put them into a tub or pan with a tap 
to it, and pour upon them as much boiling 
water as will just cover them. As soon as 
the heat will permit the hand to be put into 
the vessel, bruise them well till all the ber- 
ries are broken. Then let them stand covered 
till the berries begin to rise toward the top, 
which they usually do in three or four days. 
Then draw off the clear liquor into another 
vessel, and add to every ten quarts of this 
liquor four pounds of sugar* Stir it well, 

22 



y^i^mt JVa^f 2i0lftif 

and let it stand to work a week or ten days ; 
then filter it through a flannel jelly-bag into 
a cask. Take now four ounces of isinglass 
and lay it to steep for twelve hours in one 
pint of blackberry juice. The next morning 
boil it over a slow fire for one-half hour with 
one quart or three pints more juice, and 
pour it into the cask. When cool, rouse it 
well, and leave it to settle for a few days, 
then rack it oif into a clean cask, and bung 
it down. 

2. The following is said to be an excellent 
recipe for the manufacture of a superior 
wine from blackberries: Measure your ber- 
ries, and bruise them; to every gallon, add 
one quart of boiling water. Let the mixture 
stand twenty-four hours, stirring occasion- 
ally; then strain off the liquor into a cask, 
to every galk>n adding two pounds of sugar. 
Cork tight and let stand till the following 
October, and you will have wine ready for 
use, without any further straining or boiling, 
that will make lips smack, as they never 
smacked under similar influence before. 

8. Gather when ripe, on a dry day. Put 
into a vessel, with the head out, and a tap 
fitted near the bottom; pour on them boil- 
ing water to cover them. Mash the berries 
with your hands, and let them stand covered 
till the pulp rises to the top and forms a

crust, in three or four days. Then draw 
off the fluid into another vessel, and to every 
gallon afkt'^sie pound of sugar. Mix well, 
and put into a cadk, to work for a week 
or ten d|tys^ and throw off any remaining 
lees, keeping the cask well filled, particularly 
at the conuneuceinent. When the working 
has ceased, bung it down ; after six to twelve 
months, it may be bottled. 

FINE BRANDY SHRUB 

Take one ounce of citric acid, one pint of 
porter, one and one-half pints of raisin wine, 
one gill of orange^flower water, one gallon 
of good brandy, two and one-quarter quarts 
of water. First, dissolve the citric acid in 
the water, then add to it the brandy ; next, 
mix the raisin wine, porter, and orange- 
flower water together; and lastly, mix the 
whole, and in a week or ten days it will be 
ready for drinking and of a very mellow 
_ flavor. 

AMERICAN CHAMPAGNE 

Seven quarts good cider (crab-apple cider 
is the best), one pint best fourth-proof 
brandy, one quart genuine champagne wine, 
one otiart milk, one-half ounce of bitartrate 
pl-^tas^tu Mix and let stand a short time;

CHAMPAGNE CUP 

To two ounces of powdered Icmf sugar, put 
the juice and rind of one lemon pared thin ; 
pour over these a large glass- of dry sherry, 
and let it stand for an hour ; then add one 
bottle of sparkling champagne and one bot-

BRITISH CHAMPAGNE 

To every five pounds of rhubarb, when 
sliced and bruised, put one gallon of cold 
spring water. Let it stand three days, stir- 
ring two or three times every day ; then press 
and strain it through a sieve, and to every 
gallon of liquor, put three and one-half 
pounds of loaf sugar. Stir it well, and when 
melted, barrel it. When it has done work- 
ing, bung it up close, first suspending raj 
muslin bag with isinglass from the bung iiito- 
the barrel. To eight gallons of liquor, put:. 
two ounces of isinglass. In six months bottle 
it and wire the bottles; let them stand up 
for the first month, then lay four or five 
down l^igthways for a week, and if^i^one 
burst, all may be laid down. Shoiddva.lstrgev

BURGUNDY CHAMPAGNE 

Fourteen pounds loaf sugar, twelve pounds 
brown sugar (pale), ten gallons warm water, 
one ounce white tartar. Mix, and at a 
proper temperature add <me pint yeast. 
Afterwards, add one gallon sweet cider, two 
or three bitter almonds (bruised), one quart 
pale spirit, one-eighth ounce orris powder. 

CHAMPAGNE CIDER 

Champagne cider is made as follows: To 
five gallons of good cider put three pints 
of strained honey, or one and one-eighth 
pounds of good white sugar. Stir well and 
set it aside for a week. Clarify the cider 
with one-half gill of skimmed milk, or one 
teaspoonful of dissolved isinglass, and add 
one and one-half pints of pure spirits. After 
two or three days bottle the clear cider, and 
it will become sparkling. In order to pro- 
duce a slow fermentation, the casks contain- 
ing the fermenting liquor must be bunged 
up tight. It is a great object to retain

much of the carbonic gas in the cider, so 
as to devdop itself after being bottled. 

CHAMPAGNE CIDER, NO. J8 

One hogshead good pale vinous cider, three 
gallons proof spirit (pale), fourteen pounds 
honey or sugar. Mix, and let them remain 
together in a temperate situation for one 
month; then add one quart orange-flower 
water, and fine it down with one-half gallon 
skimmed milk. This will be very pale; and 
a similar article, when bottled in champagne 
bottles, silvered and labelled, has been often 
sold to the ignorant for champagne. It 
opens very brisk, if managed properly. 

TO MAKE ENGLISH CHAMPAGNE, 
OR THE FINE CURRANT WINE 

Take to three gallons of water nine pounds 
of Lisbon sugar; boil the water and sugar 
one-half hour, skim it clean. Then have one 
gallon of currants picked, but not bruised. 
Pour the liquor boiling hot over them, and 
when cold, work it with one-half pint of balm 
two days; then pour it through a flannel 
or sieve; then put it into a barrel fit for 
it, with one-half ounce of isinglass well 
bruised. When it has done working, stop 
it close for a month. Then bottle it, and in

TO MAKE CHERRY WINE 

Pull ofF the stalks of the cherries, and mash 
them without breaking the stones ; then press 
them hard through a hair bag, and to every 
gallon of liquor, put two pounds of sugar. 
The vessel must be full, and let it work as 
long as it makes a noise in the vessel; then 
stop it up close for a month or more, and 
yrhea it is fine, draw it into dry bottles, and 
put a lump of sugar into every bottle. 
If it makes them fly, open them all for a 
moment, and then stop them up again. It 
will be fit to drink in a quarter of a year. 

CHERRY WINE, NO. 2 

Fifteen pounds of cherries, two pounds of 
currants. Bruise them together. Mix with 
them two-thirds of the kernels, and put the 
whole of the cherries, currants, and kernels 
into a barrel, with one-quarter pound of 
sugar to every pint of juice. The barrel 
must be quite fuU. Cover the barrel with 
vine leaves, and sand above them, and let it 
stand until it has done working, which will 
be in about three weeks; then stop it with 
a bung, and in two months' time it may be 
bottled. 

S. Gather the cherries when quite ripe. 
Full them from their stalks, and press th«n 

30 



Ij^onif in aire VSLtntu 

through a hair sieve. To every gallon of 
the liquor add two pounds of liunp sugar 
finely beaten; stir all together, and put 
it into a vessel that will just hold it. When 
it has done fermenting, stop it very close 
for three months, and then bottle it off for 
use. 

GENERAL RULES FOR MAKING 

CIDER 

Always choose perfectly ripe and sound 
fruit. Pick the apples by hand. (An active 
boy with the bag slimg over his shoulder will 
soon clear a tree. Apples that have lain any 
time on the soil contract an earthy taste» 
which will always be found in the cider.) 

After sweating, and before being ground, 
wipe them dry, and if any are found bruised 
or rotten, put them in a heap by themselves,, 
for an inferior cider to make vinegar. 

Always use hair cloths, instead of straw, 
to place between the layers of pomace. The 
straw when heated, gives a disagreeable taste 
to the cider. 

As the dder runs from the press, let it 
pass through a hair sieve into a large open 
vessel that will hold as much juice as can 
be expressed in one day. In a day, or some- 
times less, the pomace will rise to the top, 

31 



Ij^otne Jllalrf VAUuu 

and in a short time grow very thick. When 
Bttle white bubbles break through it, draw 
off the liquor by a spigot, placed about three 
inches from the bottom, so that the lees may 
be left quietly behind* 

The cider must be drawn off into very 
clean, sweet casks and closely watched. The 
moment the wiuXe bubUes before mentioned 
are perceived rising at the bung-hole, rack 
it again. When the fermentation is com- 
pletely at an end, fill up the cask with cider, 
in all respects like that already contained in 
it, and bung it up tight, previous to which 
a tumbler of sweet oil may be poured into 
the bung-hoje* 

After being made afld^^^relkd it should 
be allowed to ferment until it acquires th& 
desired flavor, for perfectljr gweet cider is 
not desirable. In the oieailtime clean bar^ 
rels for its reception ^ibuM be prepared 
thus: Some clean strips -of tag are dipped 
into melted sulphur, lighted and hung in the 
bung-hole, and the bung laid l6o^iy on the 
end of the rag. This is to allow the sulphur 
vapor to well fill the barrel. Tie up a half- 
pint of mustard-seed in a coarse muslin rag 
and put it into the barrel, then put yo« 
cider in. Now add the isinglass, whic}i 
*^ fines ^' the cider but does not help to keep 
it sweet. This is the old-fashioned way, and 

32 



, ; 1 
- • / 






^ /. 



fi^otiie jpAuTit VSLtntu 

will keep cider in the same condition as it 
went into the barrel, if kept in a cool place, 
for a year. The sulp}uur vapor checks the 
fermentation, and tb^ sulphur in the mus- 
tard-seed keeps it checked. We hear that 
professional cider dealers are now using the 
bisulphite of lime instead of the mustard- 
seed and the sulphur vapor. This bisul- 
phite of lime is the same as the ^^ preserving 
powder.'* It is only, another form of using 
the sulphur, but it is more convenient and 
perhaps more effectual. Another method is 
to add sugar, one and a half pounds sugar 
to a gallon of the cider, and let it ferment. 
This makes a fermented, dear, good cider, 
but sweet. It bists sweet about -mx months, 
if kept in a cool situation, 

Preparatory'' to bottling cider it should 
be examinid^ to see. whether it be clear and 
sparUmg» If not, it should be clarified in 
a similar way to beer, and left for a fort- 
night. T)i0 itight before it is intended to 
put it iikko bottles, the bung should be taken 
out of the cask, and left so until the next 
day, when it may be bottled, but not corked 
down until the day after, as, if this be done 
at once, many of the bottles will burst by 
keeping. The best corks and champagne 
bottles should be used, and it is usual to wire 
and cover the corks with tinfoil, after the

manner of champagne. A few bottles may 
be kept in a warm place to ripen, or a smatt^ 
piece of lump sugar may be put into e^ch 
bottle before corking, if the cider be wanted 
for immediate use, or for consumption dur- 
ing the cooler portion of the year, but fo^ 
warm weather and for long keeping this i)$ , 
ijijadmissible. The bottled stock should b^ 
StQred in a cool cellar, when the quality 
tfill be greatly improved by age. 



> TO CAN CroER 

'Cider, if taken when first made, brought 
\o the boiling heat, and canned, precisely as 
fruit is cftnned, will keep from year to year 
without any- change of taste. Canned up 
tbiB way in the fall, it n^y be kept a half- 
dozen yeai^ or longer, as good as when first 
made. It is better- that the cider be settled 
and poured off from the dregs, and when 
brought to boiling heat^the scum that gath- 
ers on the surf6U3e taken off; but the only 
precaution necessary to preservation of the 
cider is the sealing of it air tight when 
boiling hot. The juice of other fruit can, 
no doubt, be preserved in the same way. To 
all tastes not already corrupted by strong 
drinks, these unfermented juices are very 

34 



/. , 






^\^ 



matne Jllairf WLintn 



ddidous. The juice of the grape is better 
than wine a century old, and more healthy. 
Churches believing in literal eating and 
drinking at the Lord's supper could in this 
way avoid the poisonous fermented spirits 
and drink the pure unfermented juice of the 
grape, as was doubtless done by the primi- 
tive Christians. 



BOILING CIDER 

To prepare cider for boiling, the first 
process is to filter it immediately on coming 
from the press. vThis is easiest done hj 
placing some sticks crosswise in the bottom 
of a barrel, — a flour barrel with a si||^l&^ 
head is the best, — wherein an inch hote has 
been bored, and covering thesd- sti^s with 
say four inches of' clean rye or.^cd^eat ^tsaw» 
and then filling the barrel to w^ili|n ^. foot 
of the top with clean saaid or c6«I dust, ^ 
sand is the best. R}ur the~^der.jis it comes 
from the press int^ ihe top of this barrel, 
drawing it off as soon as it comes out at the 
bottom into air-tight casks, and let it stand; 
in the cellar until March. Then draw it oi^t 
with as little exposure to the air as possible, | 
put it into bottles that can be tightly a^d; 
securely corked, and in two months it wSl 
be fit for use. n >

TO CLEAR CroER 

To clear and improve cider generally 
take two quarts of ground horseradish and 
one pound of thick gray filtering paper to 
the barrel, and either shake or stir until the 
paper has separated into small shreds, and 
let it stand for twenty-four hours, when the 
cider may be drawn off by means of a siphon 
or a stop cock. Instead of paper, a prepa- 
ration of wool may be taken, which is to be 
had in the market, and which is preferable 
to paper, as it has simply to be washed with 
water, when it may be used again. 

CroER, TO PRESERVE AND KEEP 

SWEET 

1. To one barrel of cider, put in one 
pound of mustard-seed, two pounds of rai- 
sins, one-quarter pound of the sticks (bark) 
of cinnamon. 2. When the cider in the bar- 
rel is in a lively fermentation, add as much 
white sugar as will be equal to one-quarter 
or three-quarters of a pound to each gallon 
of cider (according as the apples are sweet 
or sour) ; let the fermentation proceed im- 
til the liquid has the taste to suit, then add 
one-quarter of an ounce of sulphite (not 
sulphate) of lime to each gallon of cider, 
shake well, and let it stand three days, and 

36 



IHome Jllanr» awfnec 

bottle for use. The sulphite should first be 
dissolved in a quart or so of cider before 
introducing it into the barrel of cider. 8. 
When fermentation commences in one barrel, 
draw off the liquor into another one, strain- 
ing through a flannel cloth. Put into the 
cider three-quarters of an ounce of the oil 
of sassafras, and the same of the oil of win- 
tergreen, well shaken up in a pint of alco- 
hol. But one difficulty is said to pertain to 
this preparation of cider. It is so palatable 
that people won't keep it long. 



CroER CHAMPAGNE 

Five gallons good cider, one quart spirit, 
one and one-quarter pounds honey or sugar. 
Mix, and let them rest for a fortnight, then 
fine with one gill of skimmed milk. This, 
put up in champagne bottles, silvered, and 
labelled, has often been sold for chan^agne. 
It opens very sparkling. 



CHERRY CIDER 

Seven gallons of apple cider, two quarts 
of dried black cherries, one pint of dried 
blueberries, one-half pint of elderberries, 
eighteen pounds of brown sugar.

DEVONSHIRE CIDER 

The apples, after being plucked, are left 
in heaps in the orchard for some time, to 
complete their ripening, and render them 
more saccharine. They are then crushed 
between grooved cylinders, surmounted by a 
hopper, or in a circular trough, by two ver- 
tical edge-wheels of wood moved by a horse ; 
after passing through which, they are re- 
ceived into large tubs or crocks, and are then 
called pomace. They are afterwards laid 
on the vat in alternate layers of the pomace 
and clean straw, called reeds. They are then 
pressed, a Uttle water being occasionally 
added. The juice passes through .a hair 
sieve, or simflar strainer, and is received in 
a large veissel, - whence it is lam into casks 
or open , vats^^wjjere everything held in

is sweet; it now becomes imogent and vi« 
nous, and is ready to be racked . for use. If 
the fermentation continue, it is ^sual to 
rack it again into a clean cask that lu^ been 
well sulphured out, an^Lto leavfe^ behind ,the

match of brimstone burned in it. It is then 
agitated, by which the fermentation of that 
quantity is completely stopped. The cask 
is then nearly filled, the fermentation of the 
whole is checked, the process of racking is 
repeated until it becomes so, and is con- 
tinued from time to time till the cider is in 
a quiet state and fit for drinking. 

FRENCH CroER 

After the fruit is mashed in a mill, be- 
tween iron cylinders, it is allowed to remain 
in a large tun or tub for fourteen or fif- 
teen hours, before pressing.^ ^The juice is 
placed in casks, which are kep^ quite full, 
and ^o placed under gawntrees^ oj stillions,

CroER WDIE 

Let the new cider from sour apples (ripe» 

sound fruit preferred) ferment from one to 

three weeks, as the weather Is warm or cool. 

When it has attained to a lively fermentation, 

i add to each gallon, according to its acidity, 

I from one-half pound to two poimds of white 

crushed sugar, and let the whole ferment 
until it possesses precisely the taste which 
it is desired should be permanent. In this 
condition pour out one quart of the cider, 
I and add for each gallon of cider one-quarter 

ounce of sulphite of lime, not sulphate. Stir 
the powder and cider until intimately mixed, 
and return the emulsion to the fermenting 
liquid. Agitate briskly and thoroughly for 
a few moments, and then let the cider settle. 
Fermentation will cease at once. When, 
after a few days, the cider has become clear, 
draw off carefully, to avoid the sediment, 
and bottle. If loosely corked, which is bet- 
ter, it will become a sparkling cider wine, and 
may be kept indefinitely long. 

TO MAKE CLARY WINE 

Take twelve pounds of Malaga raisins, 
pick them and chop them very small, put 
them in a tub, and to each pound one-half 
pint of water. Let them steep teB or ekvcn

days, stirring it twice every day; you must 
keep it covered close all the while. Then 
strain it off, and put it into a vessel, and 
about one-quarter peck of the tops of clary, 
when it is in blosscvn; i^top it close for six 
weeks, and then bottle it off^' In two or three 
months it is fit to drink. It is apt to have a 
great sediment at hottomi therefore it is 
best to draw it off by phigs, or tap it pretty 
high. 

TO MAKE ^^INE CLARY WINE 

To five galloon of water put twelve and 
one-half pounds of sugt^i:, a^^ the whites of 
six eggs^ well beaten. Set it 6ver the fire, 
and let it boii gently near an ^ur; skim 
it clean and put it in a tub, nxkd, "wheh it

and little leaves together, and one pint of 
new ale-yeast. Then put in the liquor, and 
stir it two or three tiaoies a day for three 
days ; when it has done working, stop it up, 
and bottle it at three or four months old^ 
if it is clear.

ment with one cup of yeast. Keep in warm 
room three weeks$ then botiSe. 

TO MAKE COCK ALE 

Take five gallons of ale, and a large cock, 
the older the better. Parboil the cock, flay 
him, and stamp him in a stone mortar till his 
bones are broken (you must mw and gut 
him when you flay hi^), then put the cock 
into one quarto! sackjc^ad put to it one and 
one-half pounds of raisins of the sun stoned,

COWSLIP OR CLARY WINE, NO. 2 

The best method of making these wines is 
to put in the pips dry, when the fermenta- 
tion of the wine has subsided. This method 
is preferred for two reasons: first, it may 
be performed at any time of the year when 
lemons are cheapest, and whea other wine is 
making; second, all waste of the pips is 
avoided. Being light, they are sure to 
work over if put in the cask while the wine 
is in a state of fermentation. Boil fourteen 
pounds of good moist sugar with five gal- 
lons of water, and one ounce of hops. Shave 
thin the rinds of eight lemons or Seville 
oranges, or part of each; they must be put 
in the boil the last quarter of an hour, or 

44 



V^omt insure Wiintu 

the boiling liquor poured over them. 
Squeeze the juice to be added when cool, and 
rinse the pulp in the hot liquor, and keep 
it filled up, either with wine or new beer, as 
long as it works over; then paste brown 
paper, and leave it for four, six, or eight 
months. The quantity of flowers is one 
quart of flowers to each gallon of wine. 
Let them be gathered on a fine, dry day, and 
carefully picked from every bit of stalk and 
green. Spread them thinly on trays, sheets, 
or papers, and turn them often. When 
thoroughly dry put them in paper bags, 
until the wine is ready to receive them. Put 
them in at the bung-hole; stir them down 
two or three times a day, till all the cowslips 
have sunk ; at the same time add isinglass. 
Then paste over again with paper. In six 
months the wine will be fit to bottle, but will 
be improved by keeping longer in the cask. 
The pips shrink into a very small compass 
in drying; the quantity aUowed is of fresh- 
gathered flowers. Observe, also, that wine 
well boiled, and refined with hops and isin- 
glass, is just as good used from the cask 
as if bottled, which is a great saving of time 
and hazard. Wine made on the above prin- 
ciples has been often praised by connois- 
seurs, and supposed to have been bottled 
half a day.

fruit into a gallon more water ; stir it about

begin to skim it on to a sieve. What runs 
through may be returned to the wine. Do 
this from time to time for several days, till 
no more jeast forms. Then put it into the

IMITATION OF CYPRESS WINE 

To five gallons of water put five quarts 
of the juice of white elderberries, pressed 
gently through 'a sieve without bruising the 
seeds. Add to every gallon of hquor one and 
Mie-half pounds of sugar, and to the whole 
quantity one ounce of sliced ginger, and one- 
half ounce of cloves. Boil this nearly an 
hour, taking off the scum as it rises, and 
pour in an open ttd) to cool. Work it with 
ale yeast spread upon a toast of bread for 
three days. Then turn it into a vesael that 
will just hold it, adding about three-quarters 
pound bruised raisins, to lie in the liquor 
till drawn off, which should not be done till 
the wine is fine.

DAISY WINE 

One quart of daisy heads, one quart of 
cold water. Let stand forty-eight hours. 
Strain and add three-quarters pound of sugar 
to each quart of liquid. Let stand about two 
weeks, or till it stops fermenting. Strain 
again and bottle. It improves with keeping. 

DANDELION WINE 

Four quarts of dandelions. Cover with 
four quarts of boiUng water ; let stand three 
days. Add peel of three oranges and one 
lemon. Boil fifteen minutes; drain and add 
juice of oranges and lemon to four pounds 
of sugar and one cup of yeast. Keep in 
warm room and strain again; let stand for 
three weeks. It is then ready to bottle and 
serve. 

DAMSON WINE 

Gather the fruit dry, weigh, and bruise 
it, and to every eight pounds of fruit add 
one gallon of water; boil the water, pour 
it on the fruit scalding hot. Let it stand

DAMSON, OR BLACK CHERRY WINE 

Damson, or Black Cherry Wine may be 
made in the same manner, excepting the ad- 
dition of spice, and that the sugar should 
be finer. If kept in an open vessel four days, 
these wines will ferment of themselves; but 
it is better to forward the process by the use ' . '^ 

of a little yeast, as in former recipes. They . - 

will be fit for use in about eight months. As ^ 

there is a flatness belonging to both these 
wines if bottled, a teaspoonful of rice, a 
liunp or two of sugar, or four or five raisins 
will tend to enliven it.

ELDERBERRY WINE 

Nine quarts elderberry juice, nine quarts 
water, eleven and one-half pounds white 
sugar, two ounces red tartar. These are put 
into a cask, a little yeast added, and the 
whole is fermented. When undergoing fer- 
mentation, one ounce ginger root, one ounce 
allspice, one-quarter ounce cloves are put into 
a bag of clean cotton cloth, and suspended in 
the cask. They will give a pleasant flavor 
to the wine, which will become clear in about 
two months, and may be drawn off and bot- 
tled. Add some brandy to this wine, but if 
the fermentation is properly conducted, this 
is not necessary.

sins, the stalks being first picked off, but not 
washed; chop them grossly with a chop- 
ping-knife, then put them into your boiled 
water, and stir the water, raisins, and flow- 
ers well together, and so do twice a day for 
twelve days. Then press out the juice clear, 
as long as you can get any liquor out. 
Then put it in your barrel fit for it, and

ENGLISH FIG WINE 

Take the large blue figs when pretty ripe, 
and steep them in white wine, having made 
some slits in them, that they may swell and 
gather in the substance of the wine. Then 
slice some other figs and let them simmer 
over a fire in water until they are reduced 
to a kind of pulp. Then strain out the water, 
pressing the pulp hard and pour it as hot as 
possible on the figs that are imbrued in the 
wine. Let the quantities be nearly equal, 
but the water somewhat more than the wine 
and figs. Let them stand twenty-four hours, 
mash them well together, and draw off what 
will run without squeezing. Then press the 
rest, and if not sweet enough add a sufficient 
quantity of sugar to make it so. Let it fer- 
ment, and add to it a little honey and sugar 
candy, then fine it with white of eggs, and 
a little isinglass, and draw it off for use.

lon of this liquor put three pounds of sugar ; 
let it stand in the vat twelve hours. Then 
take the thick scum off, and put the clear

cork your bottles well, and three months' end 
it will be fit to drink. In the same manner 
is currant and raspberry wine made; but 
cherry wine differs, for the cherries are not 
to be bruised, but stoned, and put the sugar 
and water together, and give it a boil and 
a skim, and then put in your fruit, letting 
it stew with a gentle fire a quarter of an 
hour, and then let it nm through a sieve 
without pressing, and when it is cold put 
it in a vessel, and order it as your goose-

quantity is desired, put the grapes into a 
cheese-press made particularly clean, put- 
ting on sufficient weight to extract the juice 
of a full hoop of grapes, being careful that 
none but perfect grapes are used, perfectly 
ripe and free from blemish. After the first 
pressing, put a little water with the pulp 
and press a second time, using the juice of 
the second pressing with the water to be 
mixed with the clear grape juice. If only 
a few quarts are made, place the wine as 
soon as mixed into bottles, filling them even

\ sugar, three pounds in every gallon required, 

as much boiling water as will dissolve it, and

JUNIPER-BERRY WINE 

Take four and one-half gallons of cold 
soft water, seven pounds Malaga or Smyrna 
raisins, two and one-quarter quarts juniper- 
berries, one-half ounce red tartar, one-half 
handful wormwood, one-half handful sweet 
marjoram, one pint whiskey or more. Fer- 
ment for ten or twelve days. 

KOUMISS, A TARTAR WINE 

Take a quantity of fresh mare's milk, add 
to it one-sixth part water, pour the mixture 
into a wooden bowl. Use as a ferment one- 
eighth part of skinmied milk; but at any 
future preparation, a small portion of old 
koumiss will answer better. Cover the vessel 
with a thick cloth and set in a moderately 
warm place for twenty-four hours, at the 
end of which time the milk will have become 
sour, and a thick substance gathered at 
the top. Now, with a chum-staff, beat it 
till the thick substance above mentioned be 
blended intimately with the adjacent fluid. 
Leave it to rest twenty-four hours more; 
after which pour it into a higher and nar- 

70 



fi^oitie JValrf WLlntn 

rower vessel resembling a chum, where the 
agitation must be repeated as before. In 
this state it is called koumiss. The taste 
should be a pleasant mixture of sweet and 
sour. It should always be well shaken before 
used. 

KOUMISS 

Heat four cups milk; cool; when luke- 
warm, add one-fourth yeast cake dissolved 
in one-fourth cup lukewarm water, and two 
tablespoons sugar. Four into bottles with 
patent stoppers, fill two-thirds full, cork 
tightly. Shake; let stand in kitchen six 
hours, then on ice for twenty-four hours; 
serve ice cold. 

TO MAKE LEMON WINE 

Take six large lemons, pare off the rind, 
and squeeze out the juice; steep the rind in 
the juice, and put to it one quart of brandy. 
Let it stand in an earthen pot close stopped 
three days, then squeeze six more, and mix 
with two quarts of water, and as much sugar 
as will sweeten the whole. Boil the water, 
lemons, and sugar together, letting it stand 
till it is cool; then add one quart of white 
wine, and the other lemon and brandy, and 
mix them together, and run it through a 
flannel bag into some vessel. Let it stand

POP, OR GINGER BEER 

The principal difference between ginger 
pop and ginger beer is that the former is 
bottled immediately, the other is first put in 
a barrel for a few days. It is also usual to 
boil the ingredients for ginger beer, which is 
not done for pop. Both are to be bottled 
in stone bottles, and the corks tied or wired 
down. If properly done the corks and 
strings will serve many times in succession; 
the moment the string is untied the cork 
will fly out iminjured. The bottles as soon 
as empty should be soaked a few hours in 
cold water, shaken about, and turned down, 
and scalded immediately before using. The 
corks also must be scalded. On oae pound 
of coarse loaf or fine moist sugar, two ounces 
of cream of tartar, one ounce of bruised 
ginger, pour one gallon of boiling water; 
stir it well and cover up to cool, as the flavor

of the ginger is apt to evaporate. It is a 
good way to do thus far the last thing at 
night; then it is just fit to set working the 
first thing in the morning. Two large table- 
spoonfuls of yeast, stir to it one teacupful of 
the liquor. Let it stand a few minutes in a 
warmish place, then pour it to the rest; stir 
it well and cover up for eight hours. Be 
particular as to time. If done earlier the 
bottles are apt to fiy ; if later, the beer soon 
becomes vapid. Skim, strain, bottle, cork, 
and tie down. The cork should not touch

QUINCE WINE, NO. 2 

Twelve sliced quinces. Boil for quarter

one gall(»i lemon wine, one pint spirit. 

RAISIN WINE 

There are various modes of preparing 
this wine, which is, perhaps, when well 
made, the best of English wines. The fol- 
lowing recipes are considered good: 

For raisin wine without sugar, put to 
every gallon of soft water eight pounds of 
fresh Smyrna or Malaga raisins; let them 
steep one month, stirring every day. Then 
drain the liquor and put it into the cask, 
filling it up as it works over; this it will 
do for two months. When the hissing has 
in a great measure subsided, add brandy 
and honey, and paper as in the former arti- 
cles. This wine should remain three years 
untouched; it may then be drank from the 

90

cask, or bottled, and it will be found excel- 
lent. Raisin wine is Bometimes made in 
large quantities, by merely putting the rai-

let it stand covered four or five days. Strain 
it out and bottle it up ; in fifteen or sixteen 
days it will be fit to drink. It is a very 
pleasant drink in hot weather. 

RAISIN WINE WITH SUGAR 

To every gallon of soft water four pounds 
ef fresh raisins; put them in a large tub; 
a^ f reqmently, and keep it covered with a 
■ sack or blanket. In about a fortnight the 
fermentation will be^in to subside; this may 
be. known by the raisins remaining still. 
Then press the fruit and strain the liquor. 
Have re^y a wine cask, perfectly dry and 
warm, allowing for each gallon one or one 
and one4>alf pounds of lisbon sugar; put 
thifi t»to a cask with the strained liquor.

RASPBERRY VINE6AA 

This may be made either by boiling down 
the juice with an equal weight of sugar, the 
same as for jelly, and then mixing it with 
an equal quantity of distilled vinegar, to be 
bottled with a glass of brandy in each bot- 
tle; or, in a china bowl or stone jar (free 
from metallic glaze) steep a quart of fresh- 
gathered raspberries in two quarts of the 
best white wine vinegar. Next day strain 
the hquor on an equal quantity of fresh 
fruit, and the next day do the same. After 
the thind steeping of fruit, dip a jelly-bag 
in plain vinegar, to prevent waste, and 
strain the flavored vinegar through it into 
a stone jar. Allow to each pint of vinegar 
one pound of loaf sugar powdered. Stir in 
the sugar with a silver spoon, and, when 
dissolved, cover up the jar and set it in a 
kettle of water. Keep it at boiling heat one 
hour ; remove the scum. When cold, add to 
each pint a glass of brandy, and bottle <<-

ferment three days, covering the bung or 
vent with a piece of bread spread over with 
mustard-seed, downward, in a cool place,

artificial wines rather for the sake of health 
than for the delightfulness of its taste.

Sugar down the berries ovemighty using 
more sugar than you would for the table,

lay them in a hair sieve over the basin; let 
them remain until evening, so as to thor-

done in a cool cellar, or it will be apt to sour. 
Add brandy in the proportion of one-third 
the quantity of juice, and as much more 
sugar as the taste demands. Bottle it

INTRODUCTION 

The idea of compiling this little volume 
occurred to me while on a visit to some 
friends at their summer home in a quaint 
New England village. The little town had 
once been a thriving seaport, but now con- 
sisted of hardly more than a dozen old- 
fashioned Colonial houses facing each other 
along one broad, well-kept street. A few 
blind lanes led to less pretentious homes; 
and still farther back farmhouses dotted the 
landscape and broke the dead line of the 
horizon. 

For peace, contentment, and quiet seren- 
ity of life, this little village might have 
been Arcadia; the surrounding country, the 
land of Beulah. 

The ladies of the Great Houses, as the 
11 



fl^omt iWatre Wiimu 

villagers called the few Colonial mansions, 
were invariably spinsters or widows of un- 
certain years, the last descendants of a long 
line of sea captains and prosperous mari- 
ners, to whom the heritage of these old 
homes, rich with their time-honored furnish- 
ings and curios, served to keep warm the 
cockles of kindly hearts, which extended to 
the stranger that traditional hospitality 
which makes the whole world kin. 

The social customs of this Adamless Eden 
were precise and formal. As with the dear 
ladies of Cranford, a call was a very serious 
affair, given and received with great gravity, 
and had its time limit set with strict punc- 
tuality. Cake and wine were invariably 
served as a preliminary warning toward 
early departure. Here came in my first ac- 
quaintance with many varieties of home-made 
wines, over whose wealth of color and deli- 
cacy of flavor my eyes and palate longed to 
linger. 

Vulgar curiosity made me bold to inquire 
the names of a few; imagine my astonish- 
ment when graciously told that the gay dan- 
delion, the modest daisy, the blushing cur- 
rant, had one and all contributed their nectar 
to the joy of the occasion. Flattered by my 
interest, my gentle hostess broke strict rules 
of etiquette and invited me to linger, show- 
12 



?l|oiwt jaairt WLintn 



ing me rare old gardens aglow with flowers, 
fruits, and vegetables that in due time would 
contribute to their store, and at parting 
various time-worn recipes were urged upon 
me, with verbal instructions and injunctions 
upon the best methods of putting them to 
test. 

From this beginning I ferreted out from 
other sources recipes for many curious con- 
coctions, the very name of which fills the 
mind with fantasies and pictures of the long 
ago. Do we not feel poignant sympathy for 
the grief of the poor Widow of Malabar, 
whose flow of tears has descended in spirit, 
through three centuries, to those still faith- 
ful to her memory? Did we ever pause to 
consider what a slaughter of the innocents 
went to make famous many an old English 
tavern whose Sign of the Cock made the 
weary traveller pause and draw rein, and 
call loudly for the stirrup cup of this home- 
brewed ale? Can we not feel the ponderous 
presence, and smell the strong tobacco from 
the pipes of groups of stolid Dutchmen, of 
the days of Wouter Van Twiller, when we 
read of that one-time favorite beverage, 
Schiedam Schnapps? Again, are we not 
back in that dull, but dehghtful, society of 
the days of Colonel Newcome, when a quiet 
game of bezique was interrupted by the tidy 
IS 



I^otne JWalre Wiims 

servant who brought in the refreshing Or- 
geat and delicate seed cakes? Have not our 
own grandmothers boasted of the delicious 
flavor of old English Cowslip wine or Nojean 
Cordial? 

I have confined myself exclusively to home- 
made beverages, gathering my fruits and 
flowers from old-fashioned, homely gardens. 
I leave to your imagination the times, fash- 
ions, and customs they recall. The aroma 
that clings to them is subtle. Age has 
blended and mellowed all that was crude in 
those bygone days. 

With a gentle hand I tie my little bunch 
together and present you my bouquet.

The best method of making these wines 
is to boil the ingredients, and ferment with 
yeast. Boihng makes the wine more soft and 
mellow. Some, however, mix the juice, or 
juice and fruit, with sugar and water un- 
boiled, and leave the ingredients to ferment 
spontaneously. Your fruit should always be 
prime, and gathered dry, and picked clean 
from stalks, etc. The lees of wine are valu- 
able for distillation, or making vinegar. 
When wine is put in the cask the fermenta- 
tion will be renewed. Clear away the yeast 
as it rises, and fill up with wine, for which 
purpose a small quantity should be reserved. 
If brandy is to be added, it must be when 
the fermentation has nearly subsided, that 
is, when no more yeast is thrown up at the 
bung-hole, and when the hissing noise is not 
very perceptible; then mix a quart of 
brandy with a pound of honey, pour into 
the cask, and paste stiff brown paper over 



^omt JWatrt WiUxm 

the bung-hole. Allow no hole for a vent peg, 
lest it should once be forgotten, and the whole 
cask of wine be spoiled. If the wine wants 
vent it will be sure to burst the paper; if 
not the paper will sufficiently exclude the 
air. Once a week or so it may be looked to ; 
if the paper is burst, renew it, and continue 
to do so until it remains clear and dry. 

A great difference of opinion prevails as 
to racking the wine, or suffering it to re- 
main on the lees. Those who adopt the for- 
mer plan do it at the end of six months ; 
draw off the wine perfectly clear, and put 
it into a fresh cask, in which it is to remain 
six months, and then be bottled. If this plan 
is adopted, it may be better, instead of put- 
ting the brandy and honey in the first cask, 
to put it in that in which the wine is to be 
racked ; but on the whole, it is, perhaps, pref- 
erable to leave the wine a year in the first 
cask, and then bottle it at once. 

All British wines improve in the cask more 
than in the bottle. Have very nice clear and 
dry bottles ; do not fill them too high. Good 
soft corks, made supple by soaking in a lit- 
tle of the wine; press them in, but do not 
knock. Keep the bottles lying in sawdust. 
This plan will apply equally well to raspber- 
ries, cherries, mulberries, and all kinds of 
ripe summer fruits.

COLORING FOR WINES 

One pound of white sugar. Put into an 
iron kettle, let boil, and burn to a red black, 
and thick; remove from the fire, and add a 
little hot water, to keep it from hardening 
as it cools; then bottle for use. 

FINING OR CLEARING 

For fining or clearing the wine use one 
quarter pound of isinglass, dissolved in a 
portion of the wine, to a barrel. This must 
be put in after the fermentation is over, and 
should be added gently at the bung-hole, and 
managed so as to spread as much as possible 
over the upper surface of the liquid; the 
intention being that the isinglass should 
unite with impurities and carry them with 
it to the bottom. 

TO FLAVOR WINE 

When the vinous fermentation is about 
half-over, the flavoring ingredients are to be 
put into the vat and well stirred into the 
contents. If almonds form a component 
part, they are first to be beaten to a paste 
and mixed with a pint or two of the must. 
Nutmegs, cinnamon, ginger, seeds, etc., 
should, before they are put into the vat, be 
17 



^omt i^atiir Wiinm 

reduced to powder, and mixed with some of 
the must. 

TO MELLOW WINE 

Wine, either in bottle or wood, will mel- 
low much quicker when only covered with 
pieces of bladder well secured, than with 
corks or bungs. The bladder allows the wat- 
ery particles to escape, but is impervious to 
alcohol. 

TO REMOVE THE TASTE OF THE 
CASK FROM WINE 

Finest oil of olives, one pound. Put it 
into the hogshead, bung close, and roll it 
about, or otherwise well agitate it, for three 
or four hours, then gib, and allow it to 
settle. The olive oil will gradually rise 
to the top and carry the ill flavor with it. 

TO REMOVE ROPINESS FROM WINE 

Add a little catechu or a small quantity 
of the bruised berries of the mountain ash. 

TO RESTORE WINE WHEN SOUR 
OR SHARP 

1. Fill a bag with leek-seed, or of leaves 
or twisters of vine, and put either of them 
to infuse in the cask. 

18 



fi^ome iWalre Wlintu 

2. Put a small quantity of powdered char- 
coal in the wine, shake it, and after it has 
remained still for fortv-eight hours, decant 
steadily. 

TO MARE APPLE WINE 

To every gallon of apple juice, immedi- 
ately as it comes from the press, add two 
pounds of common loaf sugar; boil it as 
long as any scum rises, then strain it through 
a sieve, and let it cool. Add some good yeast, 
and stir it well. Let it work in the tub for 
two or three weeks, or* till the head begins 
to flatten ; then skim off the head, drain it 
clear off and tun it. When made a year, 
rack it off and fine it with isinglass ; then 
add one-half pint of the best rectified spirit 
of wine or a pint of French brandy to every 
eight gallons. 

APRICOCK WINE 

Take three pounds of sugar, and three 
quarts of water; let them boil together and 
skim it well. Then put in six pounds of 
apricocks, pared and stoned, and let them 
boil until they arte tender; then take them 
up and when the liquor is cold bottle it up. 
You may if you please, after you have taken 
out the apricocks, let the liquor have one 
19 



?i^oine J»a5e WLintu 

boil with a sprig of flowered clary in it; 
the apricocks make marmalade, and are very 
good for preserves. 

BALM WINE 

Take ten pounds of sugar, six quarts of 
water, boil it gently for two hours ; skim it 
well and put it into a tub to cool. Take 
three-quarters pound of the tops of balm, 
bruise them, and put them into a barrel with 
a little new yeast, and when the liquor is 
cold, pour it on the balm. Stir it well to- 
gether, and let it stand twenty-four hours, 
stirring it often. Then close it up and let 
it stand six weeks. Then rack it off and 
put a lump of sugar into every bottle. Cork 
it well, and it will be better the second year 
than the first. 

TO MAKE BARLEY WINE 

Take one-half pound of French barley and 
boil it in three waters, and save three pints 
of the last water, and mix it with one quart 
of white wine, one-half pint of borage water, 
as much clary water, a little red rose-water, 
the juice of five or six lemons, three-quarters 
pound of fine sugar, the thin yellow rind of 
a lemon. Brew all these quick together, run 
it through a strainer, and bottle it up. It 
20 



j^oMt JHaire WLinm 

is pleasant in hot weather, and very good 
in fevers. 



TO MAKE BEER AND ALE FROM 
PEA-SHELLS 

Fill a boiler with green shells of peas, pour 
on water till it rises half an inch above the 
shells, and simmer for three hours. Strain 
off the liquor, and add a strong decoction 
of wood-sage, or hops, so as to render it 
pleasantly bitter; ferment with yeast, and 
bottle. 

BIRCH WINE 

The liquor of the birch-tree is to be ob- 
tained in the month of March, when the sap 
begins to ascend. One foot from the ground 
bore a hole in each tree, large enough to 
admit a faucet, and set a vessel under; the 
liquor will run for two or three days without 
hurting the tree. Having obtained a suffi- 
cient quantity, stop the holes with pegs. To 
each gallon of the liquor add one quart of 
honey, or two and one-half pounds of sugar. 
Boil together one hour, stirring it well. A 
few cloves may be added for flavor, or the 
rind of a lemon or two; and by all means 
one ounce of hops to four and one-half gal- 
lons of wine. 

Work it with yeast, tun, and refine with 
21 



^omt SM^^t Seines 

isinglass. Two months after making, it may 
be drawn off and bottled, and in two months 
more will be fit for use, but will improve by 
keeping. 

BLACKBERRY WINE 

Bruise the berries well with the hands. To 
one gallon of fruit, add one-half gallon of 
water, and let stand overnight. Strain and 
measure, and to each gallon of juice add 
two and one-half pounds of sugar. Put in 
cask and let ferment. Tack thin muslin over 
top, and when fermentation stops, pour into 
jugs or kegs. Wine keeps best in kegs. 

BLACKBERRY WINE 

(other methods of making) 

1. Having procured berries that are fully 
ripe, put them into a tub or pan with a tap 
to it, and pour upon them as much boiling 
water as will just cover them. As soon as 
the heat will permit the hand to be put into 
the vessel, bruise them well till all the ber- 
ries are broken. Then let them stand covered 
till the berries begin to rise toward the top, 
which they usually do in three or four days. 
Then draw off the clear liquor into another 
vessel, and add to every ten quarts of this 
liquor four pounds of sugar. Stir it well, 
22 



I^omt iWatie Wiintu 

and let it stand to work a week or ten days ; 
then filter it through a flannel jelly-bag into 
a cask. Take now four ounces of isinglass 
and lay it to steep for twelve hours in one 
pint of blackberry juice. The next morning 
boil it over a slow fire for one-half hour with 
one quart or three pints more juice, and 
pour it into the cask. When cool, rouse it 
well, and leave it to settle for a few days, 
then rack it off into a clean cask, and bung 
it down. 

2. The following is said to be an excellent 
recipe for the manufacture of a superior 
wine from blackberries : Measure your ber- 
ries, and bruise them; to every gallon, add 
one quart of boiling water. Let the mixture 
stand twenty-four hours, stirring occasion- 
ally ; then strain off the liquor into a cask, 
to every gallon adding two pounds of sugar. 
Cork tight and let stand till the following 
October, and you will have wine ready for 
use, without any further straining or boiling, 
that will make lips smack, as they never 
smacked under similar influence before. 

3. Gather when ripe, on a dry day. Put 
into a vessel, with the head out, and a tap 
fitted near the bottom; pour on them boil- 
ing water to cover them. Mash the berries 
with your hands, and let them stand covered 
till the pulp rises to the top and forms a 

23 



^OMt Jg^atre W iimu 

crust, in three or four days. Then draw 
off the fluid into another vessel, and to every 
gallon add one pound of sugcir. Mix well, 
and put into a cask, to work for a week 
or ten days, and throw off any remaining 
lees, keeping the cask well filled, particularly 
at the commencement. When the working 
has ceased, bung it down ; after six to twelve 
months, it may be bottled. 

FINE BRANDY SHRUB 

Take one ounce of citric acid, one pint of 
porter, one and one-half pints of raisin wine, 
one gill of orange-flower water, one gallon 
of good brandy, two and one-quarter quarts 
of water. First, dissolve the citric acid in 
the water, then add to it the brandy; next, 
mix the raisin wine, porter, and orange- 
flower water together; and lastly, mix the 
whole, and in a week or ten days it will be 
ready for drinking and of a very mellow 
flavor. 

AMERICAN CHAMPAGNE 

Seven quarts good cider (crab-apple cider 
is the best), one pint best fourth-proof 
brandy, one quart genuine champagne wine, 
one quart milk, one-half ounce of bitartrate 
of potassa. Mix and let stand a short time;

tation. 

CHAMPAGNE CUP 
To two ounces of powdered loaf sugar, put 
the juice and rind of one lemon pared thin ; 
pour over these a large glass of dry sherry, 
and let it stand for an hour ; then add one 
bottle of sparkling champagne and one bot- 
tle of soda water, a thin slice of fresh cucum- 
ber with the rind on, a sprig of borage or 
balm, and pour on blocks of clear ice. 

BRITISH CHAMPAGNE 

To every five pounds of rhubarb, when 
sliced and bruised, put one gallon of cold 
spring water. Let it stand three days, stir- 
ring two or three times every day ; then press 
and strain it through a sieve, and to every 
gallon of liquor, put three and one-half 
pounds of loaf sugar. Stir it well, and when 
melted, barrel it. When it has done work- 
ing, bung it up close, first suspending a 
muslin bag with isinglass from the bung into 
the barrel. To eight gallons of liquor, put 
two ounces of isinglass. In six months bottle 
it and wire the bottles; let them stand up 
for the first month, then lay four or five 
down lengthways for a week, and if none 
burst, all may be laid down. Should a large 
25 



Wmu JM^Jrir Wiimn 

quantity be made, it must remain longer in 
cask. It may be colored pink by putting 
in a quart of raspberry juice. It will keep 
for many years. 



BURGUNDY CHAMPAGNE 

Fourteen pounds loaf sugar, twelve pounds 
brown sugar (pale), ten gallons warm water, 
one ounce white tartar. Mix, and at a 
proper temperature add one pint yeast. 
Afterwards, add one gallon sweet cider, two 
or three bitter almonds (bruised), one quart 
pale spirit, one-eighth ounce orris powder. 

CHAMPAGNE CIDER 

Champagne cider is made as follows: To 
five gallons of good cider put three pints 
of strained honey, or one and one-eighth 
pounds of good white sugar. Stir well and 
set it aside for a week. Clarify the cider 
with one-half gill of skimmed milk, or one 
teaspoonful of dissolved isinglass, and add 
one and one-half pints of pure spirits. After 
two or three days bottle the clear cider, and 
it will become sparkling. In order to pro- 
duce a slow fermentation, the casks contain- 
ing the fermenting liquor must be bunged 
up tight. It is a great object to retain 
2^

much of the carbonic gas in the cider, so 
as to develop itself after being bottled. 

CHAMPAGNE CIDER, NO. 2 

One hogshead good pale vinous cider, three 
gallons proof spirit (pale), fourteen pounds 
honey or sugar. Mix, and let them remain 
together in a temperate situation for one 
month; then add one quart orange-flower 
water, and fine it down with one-half gallon 
skimmed milk. This will be very pale; and 
a similar article, when bottled in champagne 
bottles, silvered and labelled, has been often 
sold to the ignorant for champagne. It 
opens very brisk, if managed properly. 

TO MAKE ENGLISH CHAMPAGNE, 
OR THE FINE CURRANT WINE 

Take to three gallons of water nine pounds 
of Lisbon sugar; boil the water and sugar 
one-half hour, skim it clean. Then have one 
gallon of currants picked, but not bruised. 
Pour the liquor boiling hot over them, and 
when cold, work it with one-half pint of balm 
two days; then pour it through a flannel 
or sieve; then put it into a barrel fit for 
it, with one-half ounce of isinglass well 
bruised. When it has done working, stop 
it close for a month. Then bottle it, and in 
27 



^omt JWatre Wiimu 

every bottle put a very small lump of double 
refined sugar. This is excellent wine, and 
has a beautiful color. 

SHAM CHAMPAGNE 

One lemon sliced, one tablespoon tartaric 
acid, one ounce of race-gin c;cr, one and one- 
half pounds sugar, two and one-half gallons 
of boiling water poured on the above. When 
blood warm, add one gill of distillery yeast, 
or two gills of home-brewed. Let it stand in 
the sun through the day. When cold, in 
the evening, bottle, cork, and wire it. In 
two days it is ready for use. 

CHEAP AND AGREEABLE TABLE 
BEER 

Take four and one-half gallons of water 
and boil one half, putting the other into 
a barrel; add the boiling water to the cold 
with one quart of molasses and a little yeast. 
Keep the bung-hole open until fermentation 
ceases. 

CHERRY BOUNCE 

Four quarts of wild cherries stemmed and 
well washed, four quarts of water. (I put 
mine in a big yellow bowl, and cover with 
double cheese-cloth, and set behind the 
kitchen stove for two weeks.) Skim every 
28

few days. Then strain, add three-quarters 
pound sugar to each quart of liquid, and 
let ferment again. This takes about two 
weeks. When it stops working, add rum, — 
about two bottles full for this quantity. (It 
is good without any rum.) 



CHERRY BOUNCE, NO. 2 

One quart of rum to one quart of wild 
cherries, and three-quarters pound of sugar. 
i*ut into a jug, and at first give it a fre- 
quent shake. Let it stand for several months 
before you pour off and bottle. A little 
water put on to the cherries left in the jug 
will make a pleasant and less ardent drink. 



CHERRY BOUNCE, NO. 3 

One gallon of good whiskey, one and one- 
half pints of wild black cherries bruised so 
as to break the stones, two ounces of common 
almonds shelled, two ounces of white sugar, 
one-half teaspoonful cinnamon, one-quarter 
teaspoonful cloves, one-quarter teaspoonful 
nutmeg, all bruised. Let stand twelve to 
thirteen days, and di'aw off. This, with the 
addition of one-half gallon of brandy, makes 
very nice cherry bounce.

TO MAKE CHERRY WINE 

Pull off the stalks of the cherries, and mash 
them without breaking the stones ; then press 
them hard through a hair bag, and to every 
gallon of liquor, put two pounds of sugar. 
The vessel must be full, and let it work as 
long as it makes a noise in the vessel; then 
stop it up close for a month or more, and 
>vhen it is fine, draw it into dry bottles, and 
put a lump of sugar into every bottle. 
If it makes them fly, open them all for a 
moment, and then stop them up again. It 
will be fit to drink in a quarter of a year. 

CHERRY WINE, NO. 2 

Fifteen pounds of cherries, two pounds of 
currants. Bruise them together. Mix with 
them two-thirds of the kernels, and put the 
whole of the cherries, currants, and kernels 
into a barrel, with one-quarter pound of 
sugar to every pint of juice. The barrel 
must be quite full. Cover the barrel with 
vine leaves, and sand above them, and let it 
stand until it has done working, which will 
be in about three weeks ; then stop it with 
a bung, and in two months' time it may be 
bottled. 

2. Gather the cherries when quite ripe. 
Pull them from their stalks, and press them 
30 



IS^omt JWaire WLinm 



through a hair sieve. To every gallon of 
the liquor add two pounds of lump sugar 
finely beaten ; stir all together, and put 
it into a vessel that will just hold it. When 
it has done fermenting, stop it very close 
for three months, and then bottle it off for 
use. 

GENERAL RULES FOR MAKING 
CIDER 

Always choose perfectly ripe and sound 
fruit. Pick the apples by hand. (An active 
boy with the bag slung over his shoulder will 
soon clear a tree. Apples that have lain any 
time on the soil contract an earthy taste, 
which will always be found in the cider.) 

After sweating, and before being ground, 
wipe them dry, and if any are found bruised 
or rotten, put them in a heap by themselves, 
for an inferior cider to make vinegar. 

Always use hair cloths, instead of straw, 
to place between the layers of pomace. The 
straw when heated, gives a disagreeable taste 
to the cider. 

As the cider runs from the press, let it 
pass through a hair sieve into a large open 
vessel that will hold as much juice as can 
be expressed in one day. In a day, or some- 
times less, the pomace will rise to the top, 
31 



I^ome M^^t WLinm 

and in a short time grow very thick. When 
little white bubbles break through it, draw 
off the liquor by a spigot, placed about three 
inches from the bottom, so that the lees may 
be left quietly behind. 

The cider must be drawn off into very 
clean, sweet casks and closely watched. The 
moment the white bubbles before mentioned 
are perceived rising at the bung-hole, rack 
it again. When the fermentation is com- 
pletely at an end, fill up the cask with cider, 
in all respects like that already contained in 
it, and bung it up tight, previous to which 
a tumbler of sweet oil may be poured into 
the bung-hole. 

After being made and barrelled it should 
be allowed to ferment until it acquires the 
desired flavor, for perfectly sweet cider is 
not desirable. In the meantime clean bar- 
rels for its reception should be prepared 
thus: Some clean strips of rag are dipped 
into melted sulphur, lighted and hung in the 
bung-hole, and the bung laid loosely on the 
end of the rag. This is to allow the sulphur 
vapor to well fill the barrel. Tie up a half- 
pint of mustard-seed in a coarse muslin rag 
and put it into the barrel, then put your 
cider in. Now add the isinglass, which 
" fines " the cider but does not help to keep 
it sweet. This is the old-fashioned way, and 
32 



I^otne Jdatre Wiimu 

will keep cider in the same condition as it 
went into the barrel, if kept in a cool place, 
for a year. The sulphur vapor checks the 
fermentation, and the sulphur in the mus- 
tard-seed keeps it checked. We hear that 
professional cider dealers are now using the 
bisulphite of lime instead of the mustard- 
seed and the sulphur vapor. This bisul- 
phite of lime is the same as the " preserving 
powder." It is only another form of using 
the sulphur, but it is more convenient and 
perhaps more effectual. Another method is 
to add sugar, one and a half pounds sugar 
to a gallon of the cider, and let it ferment. 
This makes a fermented, clear, good cider, 
but sweet. It lasts sweet about six months, 
if kept in a cool situation. 

Preparatory to bottling cider it should 
be examined, to see whether it be clear and 
sparkling. If not, it should be clarified in 
a similar way to beer, and left for a fort- 
night. The night before it is intended to 
put it Into bottles, the bung should be taken 
out of the cask, and left so until the next 
day, when it may be bottled, but not corked 
down until the day after, as, if this be done 
at once, many of the bottles will burst by 
keeping. The best corks and champagne 
bottles should be used, and it is usual to wire 
and cover the corks with tinfoil, after the 
33 



^o%m l^atre WLinm 

manner of champagne. A few bottles may 
be kept in a warm place to ripen, or a small 
piece of lump sugar may be put into each 
bottle before corking, if the cider be wanted 
for immediate use, or for consumption dur- 
ing the cooler portion of the year, but for 
warm weather and for long keeping this is 
inadmissible. The bottled stock should be 
stored in a cool cellar, when the quality 
will be greatly improved by age. 



TO CAN CIDER 

Cider, if taken when first made, brought 
to the boiling heat, and canned, precisely as 
fruit is canned, will keep from year to year 
without any change of taste. Canned up 
this way in the fall, it may be kept a half- 
dozen years or longer, as good as when first 
made. It is better that the cider be settled 
and poured off from the dregs, and when 
brought to boiling heat the scum that gath- 
ers on the surface taken off; but the only 
precaution necessary to preservation of the 
cider is the sealing of it air tight when 
boiling hot. The juice of other fruit can, 
no doubt, be preserved in the same way. To 
all tastes not already corrupted by strong 
drinks, these unfermented juices are very 
34 



^omt jaatre amines 



delicious. The juice of the grape is better 
than wine a century old, and more healthy. 
Churches believing in literal eating and 
drinking at the Lord's supper could in this 
way avoid the poisonous fermented spirits 
and drink the pure unfermented juice of the 
grape, as was doubtless done by the primi- 
tive Christians. 

BOILING CIDER 

To prepare cider for boiling, the first 
process is to filter it immediately on coming 
from the press. This is easiest done by 
placing some sticks crosswise in the bottom 
of a barrel, — a flour barrel with a single 
iiead is the best, — wherein an inch hole has 
been bored, and covering these sticks with 
say four inches of clean rye or wheat straw, 
and then filling the barrel to within a foot 
of the top with clean sand or coal dust, — 
sand is the best. Pour the cider as it comes 
from the press into the top of this barrel, 
draAving it off as soon as it comes out at the 
bottom into air-tight casks, and let it stand 
in the cellar until March. Then draw it out 
with as little exposure to the air as possible, 
put it into bottles that can be tightly and 
securely corked, and in two months it wl15 
be fit for use.

TO CLEAR CIDER 

To clear and improve cider generally 
take two quarts of ground horseradish and 
one pound of thick gray filtering paper to 
the barrel, and either shake or stir until the 
paper has separated into small shreds, and 
let it stand for twenty-four hours, when the 
cider may be drawn off by means of a siphon 
or a stop cock. Instead of paper, a prepa- 
ration of wool may be taken, which is to be 
had in the market, and which is preferable 
to paper, as it has simply to be washed with 
water, when it may be used again. 

CIDER, TO PRESERVE AND KEEP 
SWEET 

1. To one barrel of cider, put in one 
pound of mustard-seed, two pounds of rai- 
sins, one-quarter pound of the sticks (bark) 
of cinnamon. 2. When the cider in the bar- 
rel is in a lively fermentation, add as much 
white sugar as will be equal to one-quarter 
or three-quarters of a pound to each gallon 
of cider (according as the apples are sweet 
or sour) ; let the fermentation proceed un- 
til the liquid has the taste to suit, then add 
one-quarter of an ounce of sulphite (not 
sulphate) of lime to each gallon of cider, 
shake well, and let it stand three days, and 
36 



%oing MiJift WHnm 

bottle for use. The sulphite should first be 
dissolved in a quart or so of cider before 
introducing it into the barrel of cider. S. 
When fermentation commences in one barrel, 
draw off the liquor into another one, strain- 
ing through a flannel cloth. Put into the 
cider three-quarters of an ounce of the oil 
of sassafras, and the same of the oil of win- 
ter green, well shaken up in a pint of alco- 
hol. But one difficulty is said to pertain to 
this preparation of cider. It is so palatable 
that people won't keep it long. 



CIDER CHAMPAGNE 

Five gallons good cider, one quart spirit, 
one and one-quarter pounds honey or sugar. 
Mix, and let them rest for a fortnight, then 
fine with one gill of skimmed milk. This, 
put up in champagne bottles, silvered, and 
labelled, has often been sold for champagne. 
It opens very sparkling. 



CHERRY CIDER 

Seven gallons of apple cider, two quarts 
of dried black cherries, one pint of dried 
blueberries, one-half pint of elderberries, 
eighteen pounds of brown sugar.

DEVONSHIRE CIDER 

The apples, after being plucked, are left 
in heaps in the orchard for some time, to 
complete their ripening, and render them 
more saccharine. They are then crushed 
between grooved cylinders, surmounted by a 
hopper, or in a circular trough, by two ver- 
tical edge-wheels of wood moved by a horse; 
after passing through which, they are re- 
ceived into large tubs or crocks, and are then 
called pomace. They are afterwards laid 
on the vat in alternate layers of the pomace 
and clean straw, called reeds. They are then 
pressed, a little water being occasionally 
added. The juice passes through a hair 
sieve, or similar strainer, and is received in 
a large vessel, whence it is run into casks 
or open vats, where everything held in 
mechanical suspension is deposited. The fer- 
mentation is often slow of being developed; 
though the juice be set in November or De- 
cember, the working sometimes hardly com- 
mences till March. Till this time the cider 
is sweet; it now becomes pungent and vi- 
nous, and is ready to be racked for use. If 
the fermentation continue, it is usual to 
rack it again into a clean cask that has been 
well sulphured out, and to leave behind the 
head and sediment; or two or three cans 
of cider are put into a clean cask, and a 
38 



fl^otne M^^t WLintu 

match of brimstone burned In it. It is then 
agitated, by which the fermentation of that 
quantity is completely stopped. The cask 
is then nearly filled, the fermentation of the 
whole is checked, the process of racking is 
repeated until it becomes so, and is con- 
tinued from time to time till the cider is in 
a quiet state and fit for drinking. 

FRENCH CIDER 

After the fruit is mashed in a mill, be- 
tween iron cylinders, it is allowed to remain 
in a large tun or tub for fourteen or fif- 
teen hours, before pressing. The juice is 
placed in casks, which are kept quite full, 
and so placed under gawntrees, or stillions, 
that small tubs may be put under them, to 
receive the matter that works over. At the 
end of three or four days for sweet cider, 
and nine or ten days for strong cider, it is 
racked into sulphured casks, and then stored 
in a cool place. 

WESTERN CIDER 

To one pound of sugar, add one-half 
ounce of tartaric acid, two tablespoonfuls 
of good yeast. Dissolve the sugar in one 
quart of warm water; put all in a gallon 
jug, shako it well, fill the jug with pure 
39 



Hfowe JWaat WLlmu 

cold water, let it stand uncorked twelve 
hours, and it is fit for use. 

CIDER WITHOUT APPLES 

To each gallon of cold water, put one 
pound common sugar, one-half ounce tar- 
taric acid, one tablespoonful of yeast. Shake 
well, make in the evening, and it will be fit 
for use next day. Make in a keg a few 
gallons at a time, leaving a few quarts to 
make into next time, not using yeast again 
until keg needs rinsing. If it gets a little 
sour, make a little more into it, or put as 
much water with it as there is cider, and put 
it with the vinegar. If it is desired to bottle 
this cider by manufacturers of small drinks, 
you will proceed as follows : five gallons hot 
water, thirty pounds brown sugar, three- 
quarters pound tartaric acid, twenty-five 
gallons cold water, three pints of hops or 
brewers' yeast worked into paste with three- 
quarters pound flour, and one pint water 
will be required in making this paste. Put 
all together in a barrel, which it will fill, and 
let it work twenty-four hours, the yeast run- 
ning out at a bung all the time, by putting 
in a little occasionally to keep it full. Then 
bottle, putting in two or three broken raisins 
to each bottle, and it will nearly equal cham- 
pagne.

CIDER WINE 

Let the new cider from sour apples (ripe, 
sound fruit preferred) ferment from one to 
three weeks, as the weather is warm or cool. 
When it has attained to a lively fermentation, 
add to each gallon, according to its acidity, 
from one-half pound to two pounds of white 
crushed sugar, and let the whole ferment 
until it possesses precisely the taste which 
it is desired should be permanent. In this 
condition pour out one quart of the cider, 
and add for each gallon of cider one-quarter 
ounce of sulphite of lime, not sulphate. Stir 
the powder and cider until intimately mixed, 
and return the emulsion to the fermenting 
liquid. Agitate briskly and thoroughly for 
a few moments, and then let the cider settle. 
Fermentation will cease at once. When, 
after a few days, the cider has become clear, 
draw off carefully, to avoid the sediment, 
and bottle. If loosely corked, which is bet- 
ter, it will become a sparkling cider wine, and 
may be kept indefinitely long. 

TO MAKE CLARY WINE 

Take twelve pounds of Malaga raisins, 

pick them and chop them very small, put 

them in a tub, and to each pound one-half 

pint of water. Let them steep ten or eleven 

41 



^omt ittatrr imintu 

days, stirring it twice every day; you must 
keep it covered close all the while. Then 
strain it oif, and put it into a vessel, and 
about one-quarter peck of the tops of clary, 
when it is in blossom; stop it close for six 
weeks, and then bottle it off. In two or three 
months it is fit to drink. It is apt to have a 
great sediment at bottom; therefore it is 
best to draw it off by plugs, or tap it pretty 
high. 

TO MAKE FINE CLARY WINE 

To five gallons of water put twelve and 
one-half pounds of sugar, and the whites of 
six eggs well beaten. Set it over the fire, 
and let it boil gently near an hour; skim 
it clean and put it in a tub, and when it 
is near cold, then put into the vessel you 
keep it in about half a strike of clary in the 
blossom, stripped from the stalks, flowers 
and little leaves together, and one pint of 
new ale-yeast. Then put in the liquor, and 
stir it two or three times a day for three 
days ; when it has done working, stop it up, 
and bottle it at three or four months old, 
if it is clear. 

CLOVER WINE 

Three quarts blossoms, four quarts boiling 
water; let stand three days. Drain, and to 
42 



^omt JWatrir mLimn 

the flower heads add three more quarts of wa- 
ter and the peel of one lemon. Boil fifteen 
minutes, drain, and add to other juice. To 
every quart, add one pound of sugar; fer- 
ment with one cup of yeast. Keep in warm 
room three weeks, then bottle. 

TO MAKE COCK ALE 

Take five gallons of ale, and a large cock, 
the older the better. Parboil the cock, flay 
him, and stamp him in a stone mortar till his 
bones are broken (you must craw and gut 
him when you flay him), then put the cock 
into one quart of sack, and put to it one and 
one-half pounds of raisins of the sun stoned, 
some blades of mace, and a few cloves. Put 
all these into a canvas bag, and a little before 
you find the ale has done working, put the 
ale and bag together into a vessel. In a 
week or nine days' time bottle it up ; fill the 
bottle but just above the neck, and give it 
the same time to ripen as other ale. 

TO MAKE COWSLIP WINE 

To three gallons of water put seven 
pounds of sugar; stir it well together, and 
beat the whites of ten eggs very well, and 
mix with the liquor, and make it boil as fast 
as possible. Skim it well, and let it continue 
43 



I^ome JWa^tre WLimn 

boiling two hours ; then strain it through 
a hair sieve, and set it a coohng, and when 
it is cold as wort should be, put a small 
quantity of yeast to it on a toast, or in a 
dish. Let it stand all night working; then 
bruise one-half peck of cowslips, put them 
into your vessel, and your liquor upon them, 
adding three ounces of syrup of lemons. Cut 
a turf of grass and lay on the bung; let it 
stand a fortnight, and then bottle it. Put 
your tap into your vessel before you put 
your wine in, that you may not shake it. 



COWSLIP OR CLARY WINE, NO. 2 

The best method of making these wines is 
to put in the pips dry, when the fermenta- 
tion of the wine has subsided. This method 
is preferred for two reasons: first, it may 
be performed at any time of the year when 
lemons are cheapest, and when other wine is 
making; second, all waste of the pips is 
avoided. Being light, they are sure to 
work over if put in the cask while the wine 
is in a state of fermentation. Boil fourteen 
pounds of good moist sugar with five gal- 
lons of water, and one ounce of hops. Shave 
thin the rinds of eight lemons or Seville 
oranges, or part of each; they must be put 
in the boil the last quarter of an hour, or 
44 



fi^omt JWatrt WLinm 

the boiling liquor poured over them. 
Squeeze the juice to be added when cool, and 
rinse the pulp in the hot liquor, and keep 
it filled up, either with wine or new beer, as 
long as it works over; then paste brown 
paper, and leave it for four, six, or eight 
months. The quantity of flowers is one 
quart of flowers to each gallon of wine. 
Let them be gathered on a fine, dry day, and 
carefully picked from every bit of stalk and 
green. Spread them thinly on trays, sheets, 
or papers, and turn them often. When 
thoroughly dry put them in paper bags, 
until the wine is ready to receive them. Put 
them in at the bung-hole; stir them down 
two or three times a day, till all the cowslips 
have sunk ; at the same time add isinglass. 
Then paste over again with paper. In six 
months the wine will be fit to bottle, but will 
be improved by keeping longer in the cask. 
The pips shrink into a very small compass 
in drying; the quantity allowed is of fresh- 
gathered flowers. Observe, also, that wine 
well boiled, and refined with hops and isin- 
glass, is just as good used from the cask 
as if bottled, which is a great saving of time 
and hazard. Wine made on the above prin- 
ciples has been often praised by connois- 
seurs, and supposed to have been bottled 
half a day.

CURRANT SHRUB 

Take white currants when quite ripe, pick 
them off the stalks, and bruise them. Strain 
out the juice through a cloth, and to two 
quarts of the juice put two pounds of loaf 
sugar; when it is dissolved, add one gallon 
of rum, then strain through a flannel bag- 
that will keep in the jelly, and it will run 
off clear. Then bottle for use. 

CURRANT WINE 

Take four gallons of currants, not too 
ripe, and strip them into an earthen stein 
that has a cover to it. Then take two and 
one-half gallons of water and five and one- 
half pounds of double refined sugar; boil 
the sugar and water together, skim it, and 
pour it boiling hot on the currants, letting 
it stand forty-eight hours; then strain it 
through a flannel bag into the stein again, 
let it stand a fortnight to settle, and bottle 
it out. 

CURRANT WINE, NO. S 

The currants should be fully ripe when 
picked. Put them into a large tub, in which 
they should remain a day or two, then crush 
with the hands, unless you have a small 
patent wine-press, in which they should not 
46 



ISl^oMt M^^t Wiinm 

be pressed too much, or the stems will be 
bruised, and impart a disagreeable taste to 
the juice. If the hands are used, put the 
crushed fruit, after the juice has been 
poured off, in a cloth or sack and press out 
the remaining juice. Put the juice back 
into the tub after cleansing it, where it 
should remain about three days, until the 
first stages of fermentation are over, and 
remove once or twice a day the scum copi- 
ously arising to the top. Then put the juice 
in a vessel, — a demijohn, keg, or barrel, 
— of a size to suit the quantity made, and 
to each quart of juice add three pounds of 
the best yellow sugar, and soft water suf- 
ficient to make a gallon. Thus, ten quarts 
of juice and thirty pounds of sugar will give 
you ten gallons of wine, and so on in pro- 
portion. Those who do not like sweet wine 
can reduce the quantity of sugar to two and 
one-half, or who wish it very sweet, raise 
to three and one-half pounds per gallon. 
The vessel must be full, and the bung or 
stopper left off until fermentation ceases, 
which will be in twelve or fifteen days. 
Meanwhile, the cask must be filled up daily 
with currant juice left over, as fermentation 
throws out the impure matter. When fer- 
mentation ceases, rack the wine off carefully, 
either from the spigot or by a siphon, and 
47

keep running all the time. Cleanse the cask 
thoroughly with boiling water, then return 
the wine, bung up tightly, and let it stand 
four or five months, when it will be fit to drip, 
and can be bottled if desired. All the ves- 
sels, casks, etc., should be perfectly sweet, 
and the whole operation should be done with 
an eye to cleanliness. In such event, every 
drop of brandy or other spirituous liquors 
added will detract from the flavor of the 
wine, and will not in the least degree increase 
its keeping quahties. Currant wine made in 
this way will keep for an age. 

CURRANT WINE, NO. 3 

To every pailful of currants, on the stem, 
put one pailful of water; mash and strain. 
To each gallon of the mixture of juice and 
water add three and one-quarter pounds of 
sugar. Mix well and put into your cask, 
which should be placed in the cellar, on the 
tilt, that it may be racked off in October, 
without stirring up the sediment. Two 
bushels of currants will make one barrel of 
wine. Four gallons of the mixture of juice 
and water will, after thirteen pounds of 
sugar are added, make five gallons of wine. 
The barrel should be filled within three inches 
of the bung, which must be made air tight 
48 



Il^onie JWaire Wiinm 



by placing wet clay over it after it is driven 

in. 

2. Pick your currants when ripe on a fair 
day, crush them well, and to every gallon of 
juice add two gallons of water and three 
pounds of sugar; if you wish it sweeter, 
add another one-half pound of sugar. Mix 
all together in some large vessel, then dip 
out into earthen jars. Let it stand to fer- 
ment in some cool place, skimming it every 
other morning. In about ten days it will be 
ready to strain off; bottle and seal, or put 
in a cask and cork tight. The longer you 
keep it the better it will be. 

CURRANT WINE, NO. 4 
Into a five gallon keg put five quarts of 
currant juice, fifteen pounds of sugar, and 
fill up with water. Let it stand in a cool 
place until sufficiently worked, and then bung 
up tight. You can let it remain in the cask, 
and draw out as you want to use it. 

CURRANT OR GOOSEBERRY WINE, 
WITHOUT BOILING 

Take ten quarts of fruit, bruise it, and 

add to it five quarts of water. Stir it well 

together, and let it stand twelve hours ; then 

strain it through a coarse canvas bag or 

49 



^omt jWatie Wiintu 

hair sieve, add eleven pounds of good Lisbon 
sugar, and stir it well. Put the pulp of the 
fruit into a gallon more water ; stir it about 
and let it stand twelve hours. Then strain 
to the above, again stirring it; cover tlie 
tub with a sack. In a day or two the wine 
will begin to ferment. When the whole sur- 
face is covered with a thick, yeasty froth, 
begin to skim it on to a sieve. What runs 
through may be returned to the wine. Do 
this from time to time for several days, till 
no more 3^east forms. Then put it into the 
cask. 

IMITATION OF CYPRESS WINE 

To five gallons of water put five quarts 
of the juice of white elderberries, pressed 
gently through a sieve without bruising the 
seeds. Add to every gallon of liquor one and 
one-half pounds of sugar, and to the whole 
quantity one ounce of sliced ginger, and one- 
half ounce of cloves. Boil this nearly an 
hour, taking off the scum as it rises, and 
pour in an open tub to cool. Work it with 
ale yeast spread upon a toast of bread for 
three days. Then turn it into a vessel that 
will just hold it, adding about three-quarters 
pound bruised raisins, to lie in the liquor 
till drawn off, which should not be done till 
the wine is fine.

DAISY WINE 

One quart of daisy heads, one quart of 
cold water. Let stand forty-eight hours. 
Strain and add three-quarters pound of sugar 
to each quart of hquid. Let stand about two 
weeks, or till it stops fermenting. Strain 
again and bottle. It improves with keeping. 

DANDELION WINE 

Four quarts of dandelions. Cover with 
four quarts of boiling water ; let stand three 
days. Add peel of three oranges and one 
lemon. Boil fifteen minutes; drain and add 
juice of oranges and lemon to four pounds 
of sugar and one cup of yeast. Keep in 
warm room and strain again ; let stand for 
three weeks. It is then ready to bottle and 
serve. 

DAMSON WINE 

Gather the fruit dry, weigh, and bruise 
it, and to every eight pounds of fruit add 
one gallon of water; boil the water, pour 
it on the fruit scalding hot. Let it stand 
for two days; then draw it off, put it into 
a clean cask, and to every gallon of liquor 
add two and one-half pounds of good sugar. 
Fill the cask. It may be bottled off after 
standing in the cask a year. On bottling 
51 



momt m^^t Wiimu 

the wine, put a small lump of loaf sugar 
into every bottle. 

DAMSON, OR BLACK CHERRY WINE 

Damson, or Black Cherry Wine may be 
made in the same manner, excepting the ad- 
dition of spice, and that the sugar should 
be finer. If kept in an open vessel four days, 
these wines will ferment of themselves ; but 
it is better to forward the process by the use 
of a little yeast, as in former recipes. They 
will be fit for use in about eight months. As 
there is a flatness belonging to both these 
wines if bottled, a teaspoonful of rice, a 
lump or two of sugar, or four or five raisins 
will tend to enliven it. 

EBULUM 

To one hogshead of strong ale take a 
heaped bushel of elderberries, and one-half 
pound of juniper-berries beaten. Put in pA] 
the berries when you put in the hops, anrl 
let them boil together till the berries break 
in pieces, then work it up as you do ale. 
When it has done working add to it one-half 
pound of ginger, one-half ounce of cloves, 
one-half ounce of mace, one ounce of nut- 
megs, one ounce of cinnamon, grossly 
beaten, one-half pound of citron, one-half

pound of eringo root, and likewise of can- 
died orange-peel. Let the sweetmeats be cut 
in pieces very thin, and put with the spice 
into a bag, and hang it in the vessel when 
you stop it up. So let it stand till it is fine, 
then bottle it up, and drink it with lumps 
of double refined sugar in the glass. 

ELDER -FLOWER WINE 

Take the flowers of elder, and be careful 
that you don't let any stalks in ; to every 
quart of flowers put one gallon of water, 
and thi^ee pounds of loaf sugar. Boil the 
water and sugar a quarter of an hour, then 
pour it on the flowers and let it work three 
days; then strain the wine through a hair 
sieve, and put it into a cask. To every ten 
gallons of wine add one ounce of isinglass 
dissolved in cider, and six whole eggs. Close 
it up and let it stand six months, and then 
bottle it. 

TO MAKE ELDER WINE 

Take five pounds of Malaga raisins, rub 
them and shred them small; then take one

%otng J^aHe wminm 

once or twice a day; then pass the Hquor 
through a hair sieve, and have in readiness 
one pint of the juice of elderberries drawn 
off as you do for jelly of currants; then 
mix it cold with the liquor, stir it well to- 
gether, put it into a vessel, and let it stand 
in a warm place. When it has done work- 
ing, stop it close. Bottle it about Candle- 
mas. 

ELDERBERRY WINE 

Nine quarts elderberry juice, nine quarts 
water, eleven and one-half pounds white 
sugar, two ounces red tartar. These are put 
into a cask, a little yeast added, and the 
whole is fermented. When undergoing fer- 
mentation, one ounce ginger foot, one ounce 
allspice, one-quarter ounce cloves are put into 
a bag of clean cotton cloth, and suspended in 
the cask. They will give a pleasant flavor 
to the wine, which will become clear in about 
two months, and may be drawn off and bot- 
tled. Add some brand}^ to this wine, but if 
the fermentation is properly conducted, this 
is not necessary. 

ELDER WINE, NO. 2 

Take spring-water, and let it boil half an 
hour; then measure two and one-half gal- 
lons, and let it stand to cool. Then have in 
54 



'^omt JHatlrt WLintn 

readiness ten pounds of raisins of the sun 
well picked and rubbed in a cloth, and hack 
them so as to cut them, but not too small; 
then put them in, the water being cold, and 
let them stand nine days, stirring them two 
or three times a day. Then have ready 
three pints of the juice of elderberries full 
ripe, which must be infused in boiling water, 
or baked three hours ; then strain out the 
raisins, and when the elder liquor is cold, 
mix that with it, but ib is best to boil up the 
juice to a syrup, one-half pound of sugar 
to every pint of juice. Boil and skim it, 
and when cold mix it with your raisin liquor, 
and two or three spoonfuls of good ale yeast. 
Stir it well together ; then put it into a 
vessel fit for it, let it stand in a warm place 
to work, and in your cellar five or six 
months. 



ELDER WINE, NO. 3 

The quantity of fruit required is one gal- 
lon of ripe elderberries, and one quart of 
damsons or sloes, for every two gallons of 
wine to be produced. Boil them in water 
till the damsons burst, frequently breaking 
them with a flat stick; then strain and re- 
turn the liquor to the copper. The quan- 
tity of liquor required for nine gallons of 
55 



^omt J^atrt Wiimn 

wine will be ten gallons; therefore if the 
first liquor proves short of this, add water 
to the pulp, rub it about and strain to the 
rest. Boil two hours with twenty-three 
pounds of coarse moist sugar; three-quar- 
ters of a pound of ginger bruised, one-half 
a pound of allspice, and one ounce of cin- 
namon, loosely tied in a muslin bag, and two 
or three ounces of hops. When quite cool 
work on the foregoing plan, tun in two days, 
drop in the spice, and suspend the bag by 
a string not long enough to let it touch the 
bottom of the cask; fill it up for a fort- 
night, then paste over stiff brown paper. 
It will be fit to tap in two months ; will keep 
for years, but does not improve by age like 
many other wines. It is never better than 
in the first year of its age. 

ELDER WINE (FLAVORED WITH 
HOPS) 

The berries, which must be thoroughly 
ripe, are to be stripped from the stalk, and 
squeezed to a pulp. Stir and squeeze this 
pulp every day for four days ; then sepa- 
rate the juice from the pulp by passing 
through a cane sieve or basket. To every 
gallon of juice, add one-half gallon of cold 
water. Boil four and one-half gallons with 
56 



^ovxt iMatre WLimu 



three ounces of hops for one-half hour ; then 
strain it and boil again, with one and one- 
half pounds of sugar to the gallon, for about 
ten minutes, skimming all the time; pour 
it into a cooler, and, while luke-warm, put 
a piece of bread with a little balm on it to 
set it working. Put it into a cask as soon 
as cold; when it has done working, cork it 
down, and leave it six months before it is 
tapped. It is then drinkable, but improves 
with age exceedingly. 

TO MAKE ELDER WINE AT CHRIST- 
MAS 
Take five pounds of Malaga or Lipara 
raisins, rub them clean, and shred them 
small. Then take five quarts of water, boil 
it an hour, and when it is near cold put it 
in a tub with the raisins ; let them steep ten 
days, and stir them once or twice a day. 
Then strain it through a hair sieve, and by 
infusion draw one pint of elder- juice, and 
one-quarter of a pint of damson juice. 
Make the juice into a thin syrup, a pound 
of sugar to a pint of juice, and not boil it 
much, but just enough to keep. When you 
have strained out the raisin liquor, put that 
and the syrup into a vessel fit for it, and 
one-half a pound of sugar. Stop the bung 
57 



li^ome m^^t miinm 

with a cork till it gathers to a head, then 
open it, and let it stand till it has done 
working; then put the cork in again, and 
stop it very close, and let it stand in a warm 
place two or three months, and then bottle 
it. Make the elder and damson juice into 
syrup in its season, and keep it in a cool 
cellar till you have convenience to make the 
wine. 



TO MAKE ELDER -FLOWER WATER 

Take two large handfuls of dried elder- 
flowers, and ten gallons of spring-water; 
boil the water, and pour it scalding hot upon 
the flowers. The next day put to every 
gallon of water five pounds of Malaga rai- 
sins, the stalks being first picked off, but not 
washed; chop them grossly with a chop- 
ping-knife, then put them into your boiled 
water, and stir the water, raisins, and flow- 
ers well together, and so do twice a day for 
twelve days. Then press out the juice clear, 
as long as you can get any liquor out. 
Then put it in your barrel fit for it, and 
stop it up two or three days till it works, 
and in a few days stop it up close, and let 
it stand two or three months, till it is clear; 
then bottle it.

ENGLISH FIG WINE 

Take the large blue figs when pretty ripe, 
and steep them in white wine, having made 
some slits in them, that they may swell and 
gather in the substance of the wine. Then 
slice some other figs and let them simmer 
over a fire in water until they are reduced 
to a kind of pulp. Then strain out the water, 
pressing the pulp hard and pour it as hot as 
possible on the figs that are imbrued in the 
wine. Let the quantities be nearly equal, 
but the water somewhat more than the wine 
and figs. Let them stand twenty-four hours, 
mash them well together, and draw oiT what 
will run without squeezing. Then press the 
rest, and if not sweet enough add a sufficient 
quantity of sugar to make it so. Let it fer- 
ment, and add to it a httle honey and sugar 
candy, then fine it with white of eggs, and 
a little isinglass, and draw it off for use. 

TO MAKE FRONTIGNAC WINE 

Take three gallons of water, six pounds 
of white sugar, and three pounds of raisins 
of the sun cut small ; boil these together an 
hour. Then take of the flowers of elder, 
when they are falling, and will shake off, the 
quantity of half a peck; put them in the 
liquor when it is almost cold. The next day 
59 



^omt JHaat Wiinm 

put in three spoonfuls of syrup of lemons 
and two spoonfuls of ale-yeast, and two days 
after put it in a vessel that is fit for it, and 
when it has stood two months, bottle it off. 

GINGER BEER 

The proportions of this may vary. Loaf 
sugar is preferable to moist; some say a 
pound to a gallon, others a pound and a half. 
Some allow but half an ounce of ginger 
(sliced or bruised) to a gallon, others an 
ounce. A lemon to a gallon is the usual pro- 
portion, to which some add a quarter of an 
ounce or half an ounce of cream of tartar. 
The white of an egg to each gallon is use- 
ful for clarifying, but not absolutely neces- 
sary. Some people put a quarter of a pint 
of brandy to four gallons of beer by way of 
keeping it; half an ounce of hops boiled in 
it would answer the same purpose. Boil the 
sugar, and shaved rind of lemons ; let it 
boil half an hour. Clear the lemons of the 
white pith and put them in the wine. When 
cool, stir in the yeast (two tablespoonfuls to 
a gallon), put it in the barrel without strain- 
ing, and bung close. In a fortnight draw 
off and bottle. It will be ready for use in 
another fortnight, and will keep longer than 
ginger pop. If cream of tartar Is used, pour 
the boiling liquor over it, but do not boil it,

GINGER BEER, NO. 2 

Seven pounds crushed white sugar, eight 
gallons water, one-half cup of yeast, four 
ounces best powdered ginger, a few drops 
of essence of lemon, one-half teaspoonful es- 
sence of cloves. To the ginger pour one 
pint of boiling water and let it stand fifteen 
or twenty minutes. Dissolve the sugar in 
two quarts of warm water, pour both into a 
barrel half-filled with cold water, then add 
the essence and the yeast; let it stand one- 
half hour, then fill up with cold water. Let 
it ferment six to twelve hours and bottle. 

GINGER WINE 

Take four gallons of water, ten pounds 
of loaf sugar, one and one-quarter pounds 
of bruised ginger, one ounce of hops, the 
shaved rinds of five lemons or Seville 
oranges. Let these boil together for two 
hours, carefully skimming. Pour it, with- 
out straining, on to two pounds of raisins. 
When cool, put in the juice of the lemons or 
oranges; rinse the pulp in a pint or two of 
the wine, and strain it to the rest. Fer- 
ment it with yeast; mix one-half cup of 
solid yeast with a pint or two of the wine, 
and with that work the rest. Next day tun 
it, raisins, hops, ginger, and all together, 
61 



^omt JMaSre Wilnm 

and fill it up for a fortnight either with 
wine or with good new beer; then dissolve 
one ounce of isinglass in a little of the wine, 
and return it to the rest to fine it. A few 
days afterward bung it close. 

This wine will be in full perfection in six 
months. It may be bottled, but is apt to 
fly ; and if made exactly by the above direc- 
tions, and drawn from the cask, it will 
sparkle like champagne. 

TO MAKE GOOSEBERRY WINE 

Boil four gallons of water, and one-half 
pound of sugar an hour, skim it well, and 
let it stand till it is cold. Then to every 
quart of that water, allow one and one-half 
pounds of gooseberries, first beaten or 
bruised very well; let it stand twenty-four 
hours. Then strain it out, and to every gal- 
lon of this hquor put three pounds of sugar ; 
let it stand in the vat twelve hours. Then 
take the thick scum off, and put the clear 
into a vessel fit for it, and let it stand a 
month; then draw it off, and rinse the vessel 
with some of the liquor. Put it in again, 
and let it stand four months, and bottle it. 

GOOSEBERRY WINE 

Take to every four pounds of gooseber- 
ries one and one-quarter pounds of sugar, 
62 



%ome i »aStc W^inm 

and one quart of fair water. Bruise the ber- 
ries, and steep them twenty-four hours in 
the water, stirring them often ; then press 
the hquor from them, and put your sugar 
to the Hquor. Then put in a vessel fit for 
it, and when it is done working stop it up, 
and let it stand a month; then rack it off 
into another vessel, and let it stand five or 
six weeks longer. Then bottle it out, put- 
ting a small lump of sugar into every bottle ; 
cork your bottles well, and three months' end 
it will be fit to drink. In the same manner 
is currant and raspberry wine made; but 
cherry wine differs, for the cherries are not 
to be bruised, but stoned, and put the sugar 
and water together, and give it a boil and 
a skim, and then put in your fruit, letting 
it stew with a gentle fire a quarter of an 
hour, and then let it run through a sieve 
without pressing, and when it is cold put 
it in a vessel, and order it as your goose- 
berry or currant wine. The only cherries 
for wine are the great bearers, Murray 
cherries, Morelloes, Black Flanders, or the 
John Treduskin cherries. 

GOOSEBERRY WINE, NO. 2 

Pick and bruise the gooseberries, and to 
every pound of berries put one quart of 
cold spring water, and let it stand three 
63 



I^oint JWaae Si2iinei$ 

days, stirring it twice or thrice a day. Add 
to every gallon of juice three pounds of loaf 
sugar. Fill the barrel, and when it is done 
working, add to every ten quarts of liquor 
one pint of brandy and a little isinglass. 
The gooseberries must be picked when they 
are just changing color. The liquor ought 
to stand in the barrel six months. Taste it 
occasionally, and bottle when the sweetness 
has gone off. 



GOOSEBERRY AND CURRANT WINE 

The following method of making superior 
gooseberry and currant wines is recom- 
mended in a French work. 

For currant wine four pounds of honey, 
dissolved in seven gallons of boiling water, 
to which, when clarified, is added the juice 
of four pounds of red or white currants. 
It is then fermented for twenty-four hours 
and one pound of sugar to every one gallon 
of water is added. The preparation is 
afterward clarified with whites of eggs and 
cream of tartar. 

For gooseberry wine, the fruit is gath- 
ered dry when about half-ripe, and then 
pounded in a mortar. The juice when prop- 
erly strained is mixed with sugar in the 
proportion of three pounds to every two 
64 



^mm iUlaJe WLinm 

gallons of juice. It is then left in a quiet 
state for fifteen days, at the expiration of 
which it is carefully poured off and left to 
ferment for three months, when the quantity 
is under fifteen gallons, and five months 
when double that quantity. It is then bot- 
tled and soon becomes fit for drinking. 

PEARL GOOSEBERRY WINE 

Take as many as you please of the best 
gooseberries, bruise them, and let them 
stand all night. The next morning press 
or squeeze them out and let the liquor stand 
to settle seven or eight hours ; then pour off 
the clear from the settling, and measure it as 
you put it into your vessel, adding to every 
three pints of liquor one pound of double 
refined sugar. Break your sugar into fine 
lumps, and put it in the vessel with a bit of 
isinglass, stop it up, and at three months' 
end bottle it out, putting into every bottle 
a lump of double refined sugar. This is the 
fine gooseberry wine. 

RED GOOSEBERRY WINE 

Take five gallons cold soft water, five and 
one-half gallons red gooseberries, and fer- 
ment. Now mix eight pounds raw sugar, 
one pound beet root sliced, one-half ounce 
65 



^omt il^alic Wfrlmu 

red tartar in fine powder. Afterward put 
in one-balf pound sassafras chips, one-half 
gallon brandy or less. This will make nine 
gallons. 

RED AND WHITE GOOSEBERRY 
WINE 

Take one and one-half gallons cold soft 
water, three qua;rts red gooseberries, tv/o 
quarts white gooseberries. Ferment. Now 
mix two and one-half pounds raw sugar, 
three-quarters pound honey, one-half ounce 
tartar in fine powder. Afterwards put in 
one ounce bitter almonds, a small handful 
sweet briar, two quarts brandy or less. 

WHITE GOOSEBERRY OR CHAM- 
PAGNE WINE 

Take four and one-half gallons cold soft 
water and fifteen quarts of white goose- 
berries. Ferment. Now mix six pounds re- 
fined sugar, four pounds honey, one ounce 
white tartar in fine powder. Put in one 
ounce dry orange and lemon peel, or two 
ounces fresh, and add one-half gallon white 
brandy. This will make nine gallons. 

UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE 

W^ash and take from the stems ten pounds 
ripe Concord grapes. Add two quarts water 
66 



^omt JHatre WLiiim 

and bring them to a boil. Use a potato 
masher. When the seeds separate, strain 
through double cheese-cloth. Add two 
pounds of granulated sugar and strain 
again. Bring again to a boil and bottle 
directly, boiling hot, cork and seal, or put 
into patent bottles. Serve with cracked ice 
in the glass or diluted with about one-third 
ice water. 



GRAPE WINE 

Two quarts of grape juice, two quarts 
of water, four pounds of sugar. Extract the 
juice of the grape in any simple way; if 
only a few quarts are desired, we do it with 
a strainer and a pair of squeezers ; if a large 
quantity is desired, put the grapes into a 
cheese-press made particularly clean, put- 
ting on sufficient weight to extract the juice 
of a full hoop of grapes, being careful that 
none but perfect grapes are used, perfectly 
ripe and free from blemish. After the first 
pressing, put a little water with the pulp 
and press a second time, using the juice of 
the second pressing with the water to be 
mixed with the clear grape juice. If only 
a few quarts are made, place the wine as 
soon as mixed into bottles, filling them even 
full, and allow to stand in a warm place 
67 



^omt ilHairt m^imn 

until it ferments, which will take about 
thirty-six hours usually ; then remove all 
the scum, cool, and put into a dark, cool 
place. If a few gallons are desired, place 
in a keg, but the keg must be even full, and 
after fermentation has taken place and the 
scum removed, draw off and bottle, and cork 
tight. 



GRAPE WINE, NO. 2 

The larger the proportion of juice and 
the less of water, the nearer it will approach 
to the strength and richness of foreign wine. 
There ought not to be less than one-third 
juice pure. Squeeze the grapes in a hair 
sieve, bruising them with the hand rather 
than any heavier press, as it is better not 
to crush the stones. Soak the pulp in water 
until a sufficient quantity is obtained to fill 
up the cask. As loaf sugar is to be used for 
this wine, and it is not easily dissolved in 
cold liquid, the best plan is to pour over the 
sugar, three pounds in every gallon required, 
as much boiling water as will dissolve it, and 
stir till it is dissolved. When cold, put it 
in the cask with the juice, fill up from water 
in which the pulp has been steeped. To 
each gallon of wine, put one-half ounce of 
bitter almonds, not blanched, but cut small.

J^omt JWaire WLlntu 

The fermentation will not be very great. 
When it subsides, proceed with brandy and 
papering. 

GRAPE WINE, NO. 3 

Crush the grapes and let them stand one 
week. Drain off the juice, strain; add one 
quart of water and three pounds of sugar 
to each gallon. Put in a barrel or cask 
with a thin piece of muslin tacked over the 
bung-hole, and let stand until fermentation 
stops. Put in a cask and seal securely, and 
let stand six months. Then bottle and seal 
and keep in cool place. 

HOP BEER 

Turn five quarts of water on six ounces 
of hops; boil three hours. Strain off the 
liquor; turn on four quarts more of water, 
and twelve spoonfuls of ginger, and boil the 
hops three hours longer. Strain and mix 
it with the other liquor, and stir in two 
quarts of molasses. Brown, very dry, one- 
half pound of bread, and put in, — rusked 
bread is best. Pound it fine, and brown it 
in a pot, like coffee. After cooling to be 
about luke-warm, add one pint of new yeast 
that is free from salt. Keep the beer cov- 
ered, in a temperate situation, till fermen- 
69

tation has ceased, which is known by the 
setthng of the froth; then turn it into a 
keg or bottles, and keep it in a cool place. 

JUNIPER-BERRY WINE 

Take four and one-half gallons of cold 
soft water, seven pounds Malaga or Smyrna 
raisins, two and one-quarter quarts juniper- 
berries, one-half ounce red tartar, one-half 
handful wormwood, one-half handful sweet 
marjoram, one pint whiskey or more. Fer- 
ment for ten or twelve days. 

KOUMISS, A TARTAR WINE 

Take a quantity of fresh mare's milk, add 
to it one-sixth part water, pour the mixture 
into a wooden bowl. Use as a ferment one- 
eighth part of skimmed milk; but at any 
future preparation, a small portion of old 
koumiss will answer better. Cover the vessel 
with a thick cloth and set in a moderately 
warm place for twenty-foiir hours, at the 
end of which time the milk will have become 
sour, and a thick substance gathered at 
the top. Now, with a churn-staff, beat it 
till the thick substance above mentioned be 
blended intimately with the adjacent fluid. 
Leave it to rest twenty-four hours more; 
after which pour it into a higher and nar- 
70 



I^oine il»^5e Wiintu 



rower vessel resembling a churn, where the 
agitation must be repeated as before. In 
this state it is called koumiss. The taste 
should be a pleasant mixture of sweet and 
sour. It should always be well shaken before 
used. 

KOUMISS 
Heat four cups milk; cool; when luke- 
warm, add one-fourth yeast cake dissolved 
in one-fourth cup lukewarm water, and two 
tablespoons sugar. Pour into bottles with 
patent stoppers, fill two-thirds full, cork 
tightly. Shake; let stand in kitchen six 
hours, then on ice for twenty-four hours; 
serve ice cold. 

TO MAKE LEMON WINE 

Take six large lemons, pare off the rind, 
and squeeze out the juice; steep the rind in 
the juice, and put to it one quart of brandy. 
Let it stand in an earthen pot close stopped 
three days, then squeeze six more, and mix 
with two quarts of water, and as much sugar 
as will sweeten the whole. Boil the water, 
lemons, and sugar together, letting it stand 
till it is cool; then add one quart of white 
vvine, and the other lemon and brandy, and 
mix them together, and run it through a 
flannel bag into some vessel. Let it stand 
71 



^omt JMadr Wiintu 

three months and bottle it off; cork your 
bottles very well, and keep it cool. It will 
be fit to drink in a month or six weeks. 

LEMON WINE, NO. 2 

Four pounds sugar, one pound raisins 
(bruised), two gallons water. Boil, then 
add one gallon cider. Ferment, and add one 
quart of spirits, three-quarters ounce white 
tartar, a few drops essence of lemon. Ob- 
serve to shake the essence, with a little of 
the spirit, until it becomes milky, before add- 
ing it to the wine. 

MADEIRA WINE 

To five gallons prepared cider, add one- 
half ounce tartaric acid, one-half pint spir- 
its, one-half pound loaf sugar. Let it stand 
ten days, draw it off carefully, fine it down, 
and again rack it into another cask. 

MALT WINE, OR ENGLISH SHERRY 

Take twelve pounds of good moist sugar, 
two gallons of water. Boil them together 
two hours, skimming carefully. When the 
scum is all removed, and the liquor looks 
clear, add one-half ounce of hops, which 
should boil one-quarter hour or twenty min- 
utes. When the liquor is quite cold, add to 
72 



?©ome M^^t WLinm 

it five quarts of strong beer in the height of 
working; cover up and let it work forty- 
eight hours ; then skim and tun. If none 
remains for filling up, use new beer for that 
purpose. This method may be adopted with 
all boiled wines, and will be found to improve 
their strength and promote their keeping. 
In a fortnight or three weeks, when the head 
begins to sink, add two and one-half pounds 
raisins (free from stalks), one ounce of 
sugar candy, one ounce of bitter almonds, 
one-half cup of the best brandy ; brown pa- 
per, as in former articles. It may be bot- 
tled in one year; but if left three years in 
the wood, and then bottled, it will be found 
equal in strength and flavor to foreign wine. 

MEAD 

The following is a good recipe for mead: 
On five pounds of honey pour five quarts of 
boiling water; boil, and remove the scum as 
it rises ; add one-quarter ounce of best hops, 
and boil for ten minutes. Then pour the 
liquor into a tub to cool ; when all but cold, 
add a little yeast spread upon a slice of 
toasted bread. Let it stand in a warm room. 
When fermentation is finished, bung it down, 
leaving a peg-hole which can afterwards be 
closed, and in less than a year it will be fit 
to bottle.

SMALL WHITE MEAD 

Take three gallons of spring water, make 
it hot, and dissolve in it three quarts of 
honey, and one pound of loaf sugar. Let it 
boil about one-half hour, and skim it as long 
as any scum rises. Then pour it out into a 
tub, and squeeze in the juice of four lemons, 
put in the rinds but of two. Twenty cloves, 
two races of ginger, one top of sweet briar, 
and one top of rosemary. Let it stand in 
a tub till it is but blood-warm; then make 
a brown toast, and spread it with two or 
three spoonfuls of ale yeast. Put it into a 
vessel fit for it, let it stand four or five days, 
then bottle it out. 

TO MAKE STRONG MEAD 

Take of spring water what quantity you 
please, make it more than blood-warm, and 
dissolve honey in it until it is strong enough 
to bear an egg^ the breadth of a shilling; 
then boil it gently, near an hour, taking oif 
the scum as it rises. Then put to nine or 
ten gallons seven or eight large blades of 
mace, three nutmegs quartered, twenty cloves, 
three or four sticks of cinnamon, two or 
three roots of ginger, and one-quarter ounce 
of Jamaica pepper ; put these spices into the 
kettle to the honey and water, a whole lemon, 
74 



?i^omt iWaJye Wiimu 

with a sprig of sweet briar, and a sprig of 
rosemary. Tie the briar and rosemary to- 
gether, and when they have boiled a little 
while, take them out and throw them away; 
but let your liquor stand on the spice in 
a clear earthen pot till the next day. Then 
strain it into a vessel that is fit for it, put 
the spice in a bag, hang it in the vessel, 
stop it, and at three months draw it into 
bottles. Be sure that it is fine when it is 
bottled. After it is bottled six weeks it is 
fit to drink. 

MEAD, METHEGLIN, OR HONEY 
WINE 

Boil honey in water for an hour ; the pro- 
portion is from three to four pounds to each 
gallon. Half an ounce of hops will both 
refine and preserve it, but is not commonly 
added. Skim carefully, draining the skim- 
mings through a hair sieve, and return what 
runs through. When of a proper coolness, 
stir in yeast; one teacupful of solid yeast 
will serve for nine gallons. Tun it, and let 
it work over, filling it up till the fermentation 
subsides. Paste over brown paper and watch 
it. Rich mead will keep seven years, and 
afford a brisk, nourishing, and pleasant 
drink. Some people like to add the thinly 
shaved rind of a lemon to each gallon while 
75 



I^ome iWatre miintn 

boiling, and put the fruit, free from pith, 
into the tub. Others flavor it with spices 
and sweet herbs, and mix it with new beer 
or sweet wort ; it is then called Welsh Brag- 
gart. 

METHEGLIN 

Mix one and one-half barrels of water with 
as much honey as will cause an egg to rise 
a little above the water; then boil the mix- 
ture to one barrel, skimming off the surface. 
It will be a fine red or wine color, and clear. 
Then remove from the fire, and when cold, 
put it into a barrel, leaving the bung-hole 
open for several days, until fermentation be 
over; then stop it close and put into a cold 
cellar. 

MOLASSES BEER 

One ounce hops, one gallon water. Boil 
for ten minutes, strain, add one pound mo- 
lasses, and when lukewarm, add one spoonful 
yeast. Ferment. 

MORELLO WINE 

Take the juice of Morello or tame cher- 
ries, and to each quart of the juice, put 
three quarts of water, and four pounds of 
coarse brown sugar. Let them ferment, and 
76 



^t}mt M^^t WLlmn 



skim until worked clear. Then draw off, 
avoiding the sediment at the bottom. Bung 
up or bottle, which is best for all wines, let- 
ting the bottles He always on the side, either 
for wines or beers. 

TO MAKE MORELLO CHERRY WINE 

Let your cherries be very ripe, pick off 
the stalks, and bruise your fruit without 
breaking the stones. Put them in an open 
vessel together; let them stand twenty-four 
hours, then press them, and to every gallon 
put two pounds of fine sugar; then put it 
up in your cask, and when it has done work- 
ing, stop it close. Let it stand three or four 
months and bottle it; it will be fit to drink 
in two months. 

MOUNTAIN WINE 

Pick out the big stalks of your Malaga 
raisins; then chop them very small, five 
pounds to every gallon of cold spring water. 
Let them steep a fortnight or more, squeeze 
out the liquor, and barrel it in a vessel fit for 
it. First fume the vessel with brimstone; 
don't stop it up till the hissing is over. 

MULBERRY WINE 

On a dry day gather mulberries, when 
they are just changing from redness to a 
77 



fHoine Jttatre WLimn 

shining black; spread them thinly on a fine 
cloth, or on a floor or table for twenty-four 
hours, and then press them. Boil a gallon 
of water with each gallon of juice, putting 
to every gallon of water one ounce of cin- 
namon bark and six ounces of sugar candy 
finely powdered. Skim and strain the water 
when it is taken off and settled, and put in 
the mulberry juice. Now add to every gal- 
lon of the mixture one pint of white or Rhen- 
ish wine. Let the whole stand in a cask to 
ferment for five or six days. When settled 
drain it off into bottles and keep cool. 



NOYAN 

Take six ounces of peach kernels, and one 
ounce of bitter almonds. Break them 
slightly. Put them into a jug with three 
pints of white French brandy. Let them 
infuse three weeks, shaking the jug every 
day. Then drain the liquor from kernels, 
and strain it through a line bag. Melt three- 
quarters of a pound of best loaf sugar in 
one pint of rose-water; mix it with the liq- 
uor, and filter it through a sieve, the bottom 
of which is to be covered on the inside with 
blotting paper. Let the vessel which is 
placed underneath to receive the liquor be 
entirely white, that you may be better en- 
78 



^omt jna^lre WLimn 

abled to judge of its clearness. If it is not 
clear the first time, repeat the filtering. Then 
bottle for use. 

TO MAKE ORANGE WINE 

Put twelve pounds of fine sugar and the 
whites of eight eggs well beaten into six 
gallons of spring water; let it boil an hour, 
skimming it all the time. Take it off and 
when it is pretty cool, put in the juice and 
rind of fifty Seville oranges, and six spoon- 
fuls of good ale yeast, and let it stand two 
days. Then put it into your vessel, with 
two quarts of Rhenish wine, and the juice 
of twelve lemons. You must let the juice 
of lemons and wine and two pounds of double 
refined sugar stand close covered ten or 
twelve hours before you put it in the vessel 
to your orange wine, and skim off the seeds 
before you put it in. The lemon peels must 
be put in with the oranges; half the rinds 
must be put into the vessel. It must stand 
ten or twelve days before it is fit to bottle. 

ORANGE, OR LEMON WINE, BOILED 

Take five gallons of water, fourteen 

pounds of loaf sugar, three eggs, the whites 

and shells, one ounce of hops. Boil together 

the sugar, water, and eggs; when it has 

79 



H^ottte iWatre Witmn 

boiled an hour, and become quite clear, add 
the hops and the thinly shaved rinds of six 
or eight of the fruit, — more or less, accord- 
ing as the bitter flavor is desired. Let it 
boil in all two hours; meanwhile remove all 
the peel and white pith of the fruit, and 
squeeze the juice. Pour a gallon or two of 
the hot liquor on the pulp ; stir it well about, 
and when cool strain to the rest, and add 
the juice. Some people strain off the hops, 
rind, and eggs; others prefer their remain- 
ing. It is by no means important which 
mode is adopted. Work it with yeast, as 
the foregoing article, and refine with isin- 
glass dissolved in a quart of brandy. This 
wine should be one year in wood and one in 
bottles, when it will be found excellent. 



ORANGE OR LEMON WINE WITHOUT 
BOILING 

(Take one-half chest of Seville oranges; 
they are most juicy in March. Shave the 
rinds of one or two dozen (more or less, 
according as the bitter flavor is desired, or 
otherwise). Pour over this one or two quarts 
of boiling water; cover up, and let it stand 
twelve hours; then strain to the rest. Put 
into the cask fifty-six pounds of good Lisbon 
sugar. Clear off all the peel and white pith 
80 



momt JWalre Wiint^ 

from the oranges, and squeeze through a 
hair sieve. Put the juice into the cask to 
the sugar. Wash the sieve and pulp with 
cold water, and let the pulp soak in the 
water twenty-four hours. Strain, and add 
to the last, continually stirring it ; add more 
water to the pulp, let it soak, then strain 
and add. Continue to do so till the cask 
is full, often stirring it with a stick until 
all the sugar is dissolved. Then leave it to 
ferment. The fermentation will not be 
nearly so great as that of currant wine, but 
the hissing noise will be heard for some 
weeks; when this subsides, add honey and 
brandy, and paste over with brown paper. 
This wine should remain in the cask a year 
before bottling. 

TO MAKE ORANGE WINE WITH RAI- 
SINS 

Take seven and one-half pounds of new 
Malaga raisins, pick them clean, and chop 
them small. You must have five large Seville 
oranges; two of them you must pare as 
thin as for preserving. Boil about two gal- 
lons of soft water till a third part be con- 
sumed; let it cool a little. Then put five 
quarts of it hot upon your raisins and orange 
peel; stir it well together, cover it up, and 
when it is cold, let it stand five days, stirring 
81 



Ij^ome Jttatrt WLintn 

it up once or twice a day. Then pass it 
through a hair sieve, and with a spoon press 
it as dry as you can, and put it in a runlet 
fit for it, and put to it the rinds of the other 
three oranges, cut as thin as the first; then 
make a syrup of the juice of five oranges 
with one-quarter pound of white sugar. It 
must be made the day before you tun it up ; 
stir it well together, and stop it close. Let 
it stand two months to clear, then bottle it 
up ; it will keep three years, and is better 
for keeping. 

ORGEAT 

Boil two quarts of milk with one stick of 
cinnamon, and let it stand to be quite cold, 
taking out the cinnamon. Blanch four 
ounces of the best sweet almonds, pound them 
well (in a marble mortar) with a little rose- 
water ; mix them well with the milk ; sweeten 
to your taste. Let it boil again for a few 
minutes ; strain through a fine sieve till quite 
smooth and free from almonds. Serve either 
cold or warm in handled glasses. 

TO MAKE PALERMO WINE 

Take to every quart of water one pound 

of Malaga raisins, rub and cut the raisins 

small, and put them to the water, and let 

them stand ten days, stirring once or twice 

82 



IS^omt JHalre WLintu 

a day. You may boil the water an hour 
before you put it to the raisins, and let it 
stand to cool. At ten days' end strain out 
your liquor, and put a httle yeast to it ; 
and at three days' end put it in the vessel, 
with one sprig of dried wormwood. Let it 
be close stopped, and at three months' end 
bottle it off. 



TO MAKE PARSNIP WINE 

To six pounds of parsnips, cut in slices, 
add two gallons of water ; boil them till they 
become quite soft. Squeeze the water out 
of them, run it through a sieve, and add 
to every gallon three pounds of loaf sugar. 
Boil the whole three-quarters of an hour, and 
when it is nearly cold, add a little yeast. 
Let it stand ten days in a tub, stirring it 
every day from the bottom, then put it in 
a cask for twelve months; as it works over, 
fill it up every day. 

PARSNIP WINE, NO. 2 

Take one pound of parsnips cleaned and 
sliced. When the water boils, put in the 
parsnips, and boil till they are perfectly ten- 
der; drain through a sieve or colander with- 
out pressing. Immediately return it to the 
88 



Jl^omt ittatre WLimu 

copper with fourteen pounds of loaf sugar; 
it will soon boil, being already hot, and what 
drips from the sieve may be added after- 
wards; one and one-half ounces of hops, and 
boil it two hours. Ferment with yeast; let 
it stand four days to work in a warm place; 
and tun and paste paper over. It is most 
likely it will work up and burst the paper, 
which must be renewed. It may be cleared 
with isinglass, but will not require any 
brandy. 

PARSNIP WINE, NO. 3 

Take seven and one-half pounds of sliced 
parsnips, and boil until quite soft in two and 
one-half gallons of water ; squeeze the liquor 
well out of them, run it through a sieve, and 
add three pounds of coarse lump sugar to 
every gallon of liquor. Boil the whole for 
three-quarters of an hour. When it is nearly 
cold, add a little yeast on toast. Let it re- 
main in a tub for ten days, stirring it from 
the bottom every day, then put it into a cask 
for a year. As it works over, fill it up every 
day. 

TO MAKE PEACH WINE 

Take three gallons cold soft water, four 
and one-quarter pounds refined sugar, one 

84 



fk^mt M^tit WLintu 

pound honey, one-third ounce white tartar 
in fine powder, ten or fourteen peaches. Fer- 
ment; then add six quarts of brandy. The 
first division is to be put into a vat, and the 
day after, before the peaches are put in, 
take the stones from them, break these and 
the kernels, then put them and the pulp into 
a vat and proceed with the general process. 

PERRY OR PEAR CIDER 

Make this according to directions for apple 
cider. Among the caricatures of the day 
(just after Perry's victory on Lake Erie, 
1813) was one representing John Bull, in 
the person of the King, seated, with his hand 
pressed upon his stomach, indicating pain, 
which the fresh juice of the pear, called 
perry, will produce. This caricature is en- 
titled " Queen Charlotte and Johnny Bull 
got their dose of Perry." 

PINEAPPLE RUM 

To three gallons rum, made by the fruit 
method, add two pineapples sliced, and one- 
half pound white sugar. Let it stand two 
weeks before drawing off. 

PLUM WINE 

Take five pounds of Malaga raisins, pick, 
rub, and shred them, and put them into a 

85 



^mnt iWE^e Wiinm 

tub; then take one gallon of water, boil it 
an hour, and let it stand till it is blood-warm ; 
then put it to your raisins. Let it stand nine 
or ten days, stirring it once or twice a day; 
strain out your liquor, and mix it with one 
pint of damson juice. Put it in a vessel, 
and when it has done working stop it close; 
at four or five months bottle it. 



POP, OR GINGER BEER 

The principal difference between ginger 
pop and ginger beer is that the former is 
bottled immediately, the other is first put in 
a barrel for a few days. It is also usual to 
boil the ingredients for ginger beer, which is 
not done for pop. Both are to be bottled 
in stone bottles, and the corks tied or wired 
down. If properly done the corks and 
strings will serve many times m succession; 
the moment the string is untied the cork 
will fly out uninjured. The bottles as soon 
as empty should be soaked a few hours in 
cold water, shaken about, and turned down, 
and scalded immediately before using. The 
corks also must be scalded. On one pound 
of coarse loaf or fine moist sugar, two ounces 
of cream of tartar, one ounce of bruised 
ginger, pour one gallon of boiling water; 
stir it well and cover up to cool, as the flavor 
86 



I^oine JWaire Wilntu 

of the ginger is apt to evaporate. It is a 
good way to do thus far the last thing at 
night ; then it is just fit to set working the 
first thing in the morning. Two large table- 
spoonfuls of yeast, stir to it one teacupful of 
the liquor. Let it stand a few minutes in a 
w^armish place, then pour it to the rest ; stir 
it well and cover up for eight hours. Be 
particular as to time. If done earlier the 
bottles are apt to fly ; if later, the beer soon 
becomes vapid. Skim, strain, bottle, cork, 
and tie down. The cork should not touch 
the beer. It will be fit for use next day. 
Lemon rind and juice may be added, but are 
not necessary. 

PORTER 

Eight quarters pale malt, six quarters 
amber malt, two quarters brown malt. Mash 
it twice, with fifty-five and forty-eight bar- 
rels of water, then boil with one hundred- 
weight of Kent hops, and set with ten gal- 
lons yeast, seven pounds salt, two pounds 
flour. Twenty barrels of good table beer 
may be had from the grains. If deficient in 
color, add burnt malt. 

PORTER, FOR BOTTLING 

Five quarters pale malt, three quarters 
amber malt, two quarters brown malt, burnt 

87 



I^onu JWaae Wiimu 

malt to color if required. Mash with twenty- 
four, fourteen and eleven barrels of water, 
then boil with one hundredweight Kent hops, 
and set with seven gallons yeast, three 
pounds salt. Mash the grains for table beer. 

PORT WINE 

To ten gallons prepared cider, add one 
and one-half gallons good port wine, two and 
one-half quarts wild grapes (clusters), two 
ounces bruised rhatany root, three-quarters 
ounce tincture of kino, three-quarters pound 
loaf sugar, one-half gallon spirits. Let this 
stand ten days ; color if too light, with tinc- 
ture of rhatany, then rack it off and fine 
it. This should be repeated until the color 
is perfect and the liquid clear. 

PORT WINE (BRITISH) 

1. Two gallons damson juice, two gallons 
cider, three-quarters ounce sloe juice, one 
pound sugar, one pound honey. Ferment, 
then add one quart spirit, one gallon red 
cape, a little over one ounce of red tartar 
(dissolved), the same of powder of catechu, 
one-tenth ounce bruised ginger,, one-tenth 
ounce cassia, a few cloves. Mix well with 
two tablespoonfuls of brandy coloring. 

2. Two pounds buUace, ten pounds dam- 



^amt JHaire WLitit^ 

soT^s, one and one-half gallons water. Boil 
the water, skim it, and pour it boiling hot 
on the fruit ; let it stand four or six days 
p^t least. During that time bruise the fruit 
or squeeze it with your hands. Then draw 
or pour it off into a cask, and to every 
gallon of liquor, put two pounds and a half 
of fine sugar, or rather more ; put some yeast 
on a slice of bread (warm) to work it. 
When done working, put a little brandy into 
the cask and fill it up. Bung it up close, 
and let it stand six or twelve months ; then 
bottle it off. This wine is nearer in flavor 
to port than any other. If made with cold 
water, it will be equally as good, but of a 
different color. 

3. Five gallons cider, one gallon eldei* 
juice, one gallon port wine, one and one- 
quarter pint brandy, one and one-fifth ounces 
red tartar, one-fifth ounce catechu, one gill 
finings, one ounce logwood. Mix well and 
bung close. 

TO MAKE QUINCE WINE 

Take your quinces when they are thor- 
oughly ripe, wipe off the fur very clean ; 
then take out the cores, bruise them as you 
do apples for cider, and press them, adding 
to every gallon of juice two and one-half 
89 



I^ome JWaJre Wiimn 

pounds of fine sugar'. Stir it together till 
it is dissolved; then put it into your cask, 
and when it has done working stop it close. 
Let it stand till March before you bottle 
it. You may keep it two or three years; it 
will be the better. 

QUINCE WINE, NO. 2 

Twelve sliced quinces. Boil for quarter 
of an hour in one gallon water; then add 
two pounds lump sugar. Ferment, and add 
one gallon lemon wine, one pint spirit. 

RAISIN WINE 

There are various modes of preparing 
this wine, which is, perhaps, when well 
made, the best of English wines. The fol- 
lowing recipes are considered good : 

For raisin wine without sugar, put to 
every gallon of soft water eight pounds of 
fresh Smyrna or Malaga raisins; let them 
steep one month, stirring every day. Then 
drain the liquor and put it into the cask, 
filling it up as it works over; this it will 
do for two months. When the hissing has 
in a great measure subsided, add brandy 
and honey, and paper as in the former arti- 
cles. This wine should remain three years 
untouched ; it may then be drank from the 
90 



H^ome Jttaire WLimu 



cask, or bottled, and it will be found excel- 
lent. Raisin wine is sometimes made in 
large quantities, by merely putting the rai- 
sins in the cask, and filling it up with water, 
the proportion as above; carefully pick out 
all stalks. In six months rack the wine into 
fresh casks, and put to each the proportion 
of brandy and honey. In cider countries 
and plentiful apple years, a most excellent 
raisin wine is made by employing cider in- 
stead of water, and steeping in it the rai- 
sins. 

RAISIN WINE, NO. 2 

Five pounds of raisins, four gallons of 
water. Put them into a cask. Mash for a 
fortnight, frequently stirring, and leave the 
bung loose until the active fermentation 
ceases; then add one and one-half pints 
brandy. Well mix, and let it stand till fine. 
The quantity of raisins and brandy may be 
altered to suit. 

RAISIN WINE, NO. 3 

Take two gallons of spring water, and let 
it boil half an hour ; then put into a stein 
pot two pounds of raisins stoned, two 
pounds of sugar, the rind of two lemons, 
and the juice of four lemons ; then pour the 
boiling water on the things in the stein, and 
91 



^mit M^^t Wiinm 

let it stand covered four or five days. Strain 
it out and bottle it up ; in fifteen or sixteen 
days it will be fit to drink. It is a very 
pleasant drink in hot weather. 

RAISIN WINE WITH SUGAR 

To every gallon of soft water four pounds 
of fresh raisins ; put them in a large tub ; 
stir frequently, and keep it covered with a 
sack or blanket. In about a fortnight the 
fermentation will begin to subside; this may 
be known by the raisins remaining still. 
Then press the fruit and strain the liquor. 
Have ready a wine cask, perfectly dry and 
warm, allowing for each gallon one or one 
and one-half pounds of Lisbon sugar; put 
this into a cask with the strained liquor. 
When half full, stir well the sugar and 
liquor, and put in one-half pint of thick 
yeast; then fill up with the liquor, and con- 
tinue to do so while the fermentation lasts, 
Tyhich will be a month or more. 

RAISIN WINE IN IMITATION OF 
FRONTIGNAC 

For every gallon of wine required allow 

two pounds of raisins ; boil them one hour 

in water. Strain the boiling liquor on loaf 

sugar, two pounds for every gallon; stir

cask with a moderate quantity of yeast (as 
last article). When the fermentation sub- 
sides, suspend in the cask a muslin bag con- 
taining elder-flowers, in the proportion of 
one quart to three gallons of wine. When 
perfectly clear, draw off the wine into bot- 
tles. 

TO MAKE RASPBERRY WINE 

Take your quantity of raspberries and 
bruise them, put them in an open pot 
twenty-four hours ; then squeeze out the 
juice, and to every gallon of the juice put 
three pounds of fine sugar, two quarts of 
canary. Put it into a stein or vessel, and 
when it has done working stop it close; 
when it is fine, bottle it. It must stand two 
months before you drink it. 

RASPBERRY WINE, NO. 2 

Take three pounds of raisins, wash, clean, 
and stone them thoroughly. Boil two gal- 
lons of spring water for half an hour; as 
soon as it is taken off the fire pour it into 
a deep stone jar, and put in the raisins, 
with six quarts of raspberries and two 
pounds of loaf sugar. Stir it well together, 
and cover them closely and set it in a cool 
93 



Il^oine iHaftt Wiimn 

place; stir it twice a day, then pass it 
through a sieve. Put the hquor into a 
close vessel, adding one pound more of loaf 
sugar; let it stand for a day and a night 
to settle, after which bottle it, adding a 
little more sugar. 

RASPBERRY WINE, NO. 3 

Pound your fruit and strain it through 
a cloth; then boil as much water as juice 
of raspberries, and when it is cold put it to 
your squeezings. Let it stand together five 
hours, then strain it and mix it with the 
juice, adding to every gallon of this liquor 
two and one-half pounds of fine sugar. 
Let it stand in an earthen vessel close cov- 
ered a week, then put it in a vessel fit for 
it, and let it stand a month, or till it is fine ; 
bottle it off. 

RASPBERRY WINE, NO. 4 

Take two gallons of raspberries, and put 
them in an earthen pot ; then take two gal- 
lons of water, boil it two hours, let it stand 
till it is blood-warm, put it to the raspber- 
ries, and stir them well together; let it 
stand twelve hours. Then strain it off, and 
to every gallon of liquor put three pounds 
of loaf sugar. Set it over a clear fire, and 
94

let it boil till all the scum is taken off. When 
it is cold, put it into bottles and open the 
corks every day for a fortnight, and then 
stop them close. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR 

This may be made either by boiling down 
the juice with an equal weight of sugar, the 
same as for jelly, and then mixing it with 
an equal quantity of distilled vinegar, to be 
bottled with a glass of brandy in each bot- 
" tie; or, in a china bowl or stone jar (free 
from metallic glaze) steep a quart of fresh- 
gathered raspberries in two quarts of the 
best white wine vinegar. Next day strain 
the liquor on an equal quantity of fresh 
fruit, and the next day do the same. After 
the third steeping of fruit, dip a jelly -bag 
in plain vinegar, to prevent waste, and 
strain the flavored vinegar through it into 
a stone jar. Allow to each pint of vinegar 
one pound of loaf sugar powdered. Stir in 
the sugar with a silver spoon, and, when 
dissolved, cover up the jar and set it in a 
kettle of water. Keep it at boiling heat one 
hour ; remove the scum. When cold, add to 
each pint a glass of brandy, and bottle it. 
This is a pleasant and useful drink in hot 
weather, or in sickness ; one pint of the vine- 
gar to eight of cold water.

RHUBARB WINE 

To each gallon of juice add one gallon of 
soft water, in which seven pounds of brown 
sugar have been dissolved. Fill a keg or a 
barrel with this proportion, leaving the bung 
out, and keep it filled with sweetened water 
as it works over until clear; then bung 
down or bottle as you desire. These stalks 
will furnish about three-fourths their weight 
in juice, or from sixteen hundred to two 
thousand gallons of wine to each acre of 
well cultivated plants. Fill the barrels and 
let them stand until spring, and bottle, as 
any wine will be better in glass or stone. 

RHUBARB WINE, NO. 2 

Cut in bits and crush five pounds of rhu- 
barb; add the thin yellow rind of a lemon, 
and one gallon of water, and let stand cov- 
ered two days. Strain off the liquid and add 
four pounds of sugar. Put this into a small 
cask with the bung-hole covered with mus- 
lin, and let it work two or three days. 

ROOT BEER 

Take one and one-half gallons of molasses, 
add five gallons of water at 60° Fahr. Let 
this stand two hours; then pour into a bar- 
rel^ and add one-quarter pound powdered

f^ome JWaptrr Wilmu 

or bruised sassafras bark, one-quarter pound 
powdered or bruised wintergreen bark, one- 
quarter pound bruised sarsaparilla root, one- 
half pint yeast, water enough to fill the 
small barrel. Ferment for twelve hours and 
bottle. 

ROSE WINE 

Take a well-glazed earthen vessel and put 
into it three gallons of rose-water drawn 
with a cold still. Put into that a sufficient 
quantity of rose-leaves, cover it close and set 
it for an hour in a kettle or copper of hot 
water, to take out the whole strength and 
tincture of the roses; and when cold press 
the rose-leaves hard into the liquor, and 
steep fresh ones in it, repeating it till the 
liquor has got the full strength of the roses. 
To every gallon of the liquor put three 
pounds of loaf sugar, and stir it well, that 
it may melt and disperse in every part. 
Then put in a cask or convenient vessel to 
ferment, and put in a piece of bread toast 
hard and covered with yeast. Let it stand 
for thirty days, when it will be ripe and 
have a fine flavor, having the whole scent 
and strength of the roses in it, and it may 
be greatly improved by adding wine and 
spices to it. By this method of infusion,

curious scent, may be made. 

RUM SHRUB 

One gallon raisin wine, six pounds of 
honey, ten gallons of good-flavored rum. 

TO MAKE SAGE WINE 

Boil five quarts of water one-quarter of 
an hour, and when it is blood-Avarm put five 
pounds of Malaga raisins, picked, rubbed, 
and shred, into it with almost three and one- 
quarter quarts of red sage shred, and a 
little of ale yeast. Stir all well together 
and let it stand in a tub covered warm six 
.or seven days ; then strain it off and put in 
a runlet. Let it work three or four days, and 
then stop it up. When it has stood six or 
seven days put in a quart or two of Malaga 
sherry, and when it is fine, bottle it. 

SAGE WINE ANOTHER WAY 

Take six pounds of Malaga raisins picked 
clean and shred small, and one peck of green 
sage shr'ed small ; then boil one gallon of 
water. Let the water stand till it is luke- 
warm, then put it in a tub to your sage and 
raisins ; let it stand five or six days, stir-

IS^omt jmatre WLimu 

ring it twice or thrice a day. Then strain 
and press the liquor from the ingredients, 
put it in a cask, and let it stand six months ; 
then draw it clean off into another vessel. 
Bottle it in two days; in a month or six 
weeks it will be fit to drink, but best when it 
is a year old. 



TO MAKE SARATOGA WINE OR 
ENGLISH SACK 

To every quart of water put a sprig of 
rue, and to every gallon a handful of fennel 
roots ; boil these half an hour, then strain it 
out, and to every gallon of this liquor put 
three pounds of honey. Boil it two hours, 
and skim it well. When it is cold, pour it 
off, and turn it into the vessel, or such cask 
as is fit for it. Keep it a year in the vessel, 
and then bottle it. It is a very good sack. 

SARSAPARILLA MEAD 

One-half pound of Spanish sarsaparilla. 
Boil five hours, so as to strain off one gal- 
lon. Add eight pounds sugar, five ounces 
of tartaric acid. One-quarter of a wine- 
glass of syrup to one gill of water, and one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of soda water, is a 
fair proportion for a drink.

SCHIEDAM SCHNAPPS, TO IMITATE 

To two and one-half gallons good common 
gin and five over proof, add one and one-half 
pints strained honey, two and one-half pints 
clear water, one-half pint white sugar syrup, 
one-half pint spirits of nutmegs mixed with 
the nitric ether, one-half pint orange-flower 
water, one cup pure water, one-tenth ounce 
acetic ether, one drop oil of wintergreen dis- 
solved with the acetic ether. Mix all the in- 
gredients well; if necessary fine with alum 
and salt of tartar. 

TO MAKE SCURVY -GRASS WINE 

Take the best large scurvy-grass tops 
and leaves, in May, June, or July; bruise 
them well in a stone mortar. Put them in a 
well-glazed earthen vessel and sprinkle them 
over with some powder of crystal of tartar; 
then smear them with some virgin honey, 
and being covered close let it stand twenty- 
four hours. Set water over a gentle fire, 
putting to every gallon three pints of 
honey, and when the scum rises, take it off 
and let it cool. Then put the stamped 
scurvy-grass into a barrel, and pour the 
liquor to it, setting the vessel conveniently 
edgeways, with a tap at the bottom. When 
it has been infused twenty-four hours, draw

off the liquor, strongly press the juice and 
moisture out of the herb into the barrel or 
vessel, and put the liquor up again. Then 
put a little new yeast to it, and suffer it to 
ferment three days, covering the bung or 
vent with a piece of bread spread over with 
mustard-seed, downward, in a cool place, 
and let it continue till it is fine and drinks 
brisk. Drain off the finest part, leaving 
only the dregs behind; afterward add more 
herb and ferment it with whites of eggs, 
flour, and fixed nitre, very nice, or the juice 
of green grapes, if they are to be had, to 
which add six pounds of syrup of mustard, 
all mixed and well beaten together, to refine 
it down, and it will drink brisk, but it is not 
very pleasant, being here inserted among 
artificial wines rather for the sake of health 
than for the delightfulness of its taste. 



SHERBET 

In one quart of water boil six or eight 
sticks of rhubarb ten minutes ; strain the 
boiling liquor on the thin-shaved rind of a 
lemon. Add two ounces of clarified sugar 
with a wine-glass of brandy. Stir the 
above, and let it stand five or six hours be- 
fore using.

SHERRY WINE 

To five gallons prepared cider add one 
quart spirits, three-quarters of a pound of 
raisins, three quarts good sherry, and a few 
drops oil bitter almonds (dissolved in alco- 
hol). Let it stand ten days, and draw it off 
carefully. Fine it down, and again rack it 
into another cask. 



LONDON SHERRY WINE 

Twelve pounds chopped raisins, three gal- 
lons soft water, one pound sugar, one-half 
ounce white tartar, two quarts cider. Let 
them stand together in a close vessel one 
month; stir frequently. Then add one 
quart of spirits, one-quarter pound wild 
cherries bruised. Let them stand one month 
longer and fine with isinglass. 

TO MAKE SHRUB 

Take two quarts of brandy, and put it in 
a large bottle, adding to it the juice of five 
lemons, the peels of two, and one-half a nut- 
meg. Stop it up and let it stand three days, 
and add to it three pints of white wine, one 
and one-half pounds of sugar. Mix it, 
strain it twice through a flannel, and bottle 
it up. It is a pretty wine, and a cordial.

SPRUCE BEER 

Boll a handful of hops and two handfuls 
of the chips of sassafras root, in ten gallons

one gallon of molasses, two spoonfuls of the 
essence of spruce, two spoonfuls of ginger, 
one spoonful of pounded allspice. Put it 
into a cask, and when cold enough, add one- 
half pint of good yeast. Stir it well; stop 
it close. When clear, bottle and cork it. 

STRAWBERRY WINE, NO. 1 

Twelve gallons bruised strawberries, ten 
gallons cider, seven gallons water, twenty- 
five pounds sugar. Ferment, then add one- 
half ounce bruised orris root, one-half ounce 
bruised bitter almonds, one-half ounce 
bruised cloves, six ounces red tartar. 

STRAWBERRY WINE, NO. 2 
Crush the berries and add one quart of 
water to one gallon of berries and let stand 
twenty-four hours. Strain and add two and 
one-half pounds of white sugar to one gal- 
lon of juice. Put in cask, with thin muslin 
tacked over the bung-hole, and let ferment, 
keeping it full from a quantity reserved for 
the purpose. If a small quantity is made, 
use jugs or bottle. When fermentation 
103 



IB^omt M^'Ot Wiinm 

ceases, add one pint of good whiskey to the 
gallon, and bottle and seal securely. Ready 
for use in six weeks. 

ROYAL STRAWBERRY ACID 

Take three pounds of ripe strawberries, 
two ounces of citric acid, and one quart of 
spring water. Dissolve the acid in the 
water, and pour it on the strawberries, and 
let them stand in a cool place twenty-four 
hours. Then drain the liquid off, and pour 
it on three more pounds of fruit; let it 
stand twenty-four hours. Add to the liquid 
its own weight of sugar'; boil it three or 
four minutes in a porcelain-lined preserve- 
kettle, lest metal may affect the taste, and 
when cool cork it in bottles lightly for three 
days, then tightly, and seal them. Keep in 
a dry and cool place. It is delicious for 
sick and well. 

TO MAKE SUGAR WINE 

Boil five and one-half quarts of spring 
water a quarter of an hour, and when it is 
blood-warm put five pounds of Malaga rai- 
sins picked, rubbed, and shred into it, with 
five quarts of rfed sage shred and one-half 
cup of ale yeast ; stir all well together, and 
let it stand in a tub covered warm six or

strain it out and put it in a runlet; let it 
work three or four days, and stop it up. 
When it has stood six or seven days, put in 
a quart or two of Malaga sack, and when it 
is fine, bottle it. 

TEARS OF THE WIDOW OF MALA- 
BAR 

Five quarts of plain spirit at 18°, one-half 
ounce bruised cloves, forty-eight grains 
bruised mace. Digest in a corked carboy 
for a week, add burnt sugar to impart a 
slight color, filter, and add four and one- 
half pounds white sugar, dissolved in one- 
half gallon of distilled or filtered rain water. 
Some add two or three ounces of orange- 
flower water. A pleasant liquor. 

TOMATO WINE 

Take ripe, fresh tomatoes, mash very 
fine, strain through a fine sieve, sweeten with 
good sugar to suit the taste, set it away 
in an earthen or glass vessel, nearly full, 
cover tight, with the exception of a small 
hole for the refuse to work off through dur- 
ing its fermentation. When it is done fer- 
menting, it will become pure and clear. 
Then bottle and cork tight. A little salt 
improves its flavor; age improves it.

TOMATO BEER 

Gather the fruit once a week, stem, wash, 
and mash it. Strain through a coarse Hnen 
bag, and to every gallon of the juice add one 
pound of good moist brown sugar. Let it 
stand nine days, and then pour it off from 
the pulp, which will settle in the bottom of 
the jar. Bottle it closely, and the longer 
you keep it the better it is when you want 
to use it. Take a pitcher that will hold as 
much as you want to use, — for my family 
I use a gallon pitcher, — fill it nearly full 
of fresh sweetened water, add some of the 
preparation already described, and a few 
drops of essence of lemon, and you will find 
it equal to the best lemonade, costing almost 
nothing. To every gallon of sweetened 
water I add one-half tumbler of beer. 

TO MAKE TURNIP WINE 

Pare and slice a number of turnips, put 
them into a cider-press and press out all the 
juice. To every gallon of juice add three 
pounds of lump sugar. Have a vessel ready 
large enough to hold the juice, and put one- 
half pint of brandy to every gallon. Pour 
in the juice and lay something over the bung 
for a week — to see if it works ; if it does, 
do not bung it up until it is done working.

gether three-quarters of an hour. Then to 
every gallon of liquor put about two dozen 
of walnut leaves; pour boiling liquor upon 
them and let stand all night. Then take 
out the leaves and put in a spoonful of

BLACK CHERRY BRANDY 

Stone two pounds of black cherries and 
put on them one quart of brandy. Bruise 
the stones in a mortar, and then add them 
to the brandy. Cover them close and let 
them stand a month or six weeks. Then 
pour* it clear from the sediment and bottle 
it. Morello cherries, managed in this way, 
make a fine cordial. 

CHERRY BRANDY, NO. 1 

For this purpose use either morello cher- 
ries or small black cherries. Pick them from 
the stalks ; fill the bottles nearly up to the 
necks, then fill up with brandy (some people 
use whiskey, gin, or spirit distilled from the 
lees of the wine). In three weeks or a month 
strain off the spirit; to each quart add one 
pound of loaf sugar clarified, and flavor 
with tincture of cinnamon or cloves. 

CHERRY BRANDY, NO. 2 

One of the best and most common ways of 
making cherry brandy is to put the cherries 
(being first clean picked from the stalks) 
into a vessel till it be about half-full; then 
fill up with rectified molasses brandy, which 
is generally used for this compound, and 
when they have been infused sixteen or

eighteen days, draw off the liquor by de- 
grees, as wanted. Wlien drawn off, fill the 
vessel a second time nearly to the top, let it 
stand about a month, and then draw it off 
as there is occasion. ,The same cherries may 
be used a third time by covering them with 
overproof brandy and letting it infuse for 
six or seven weeks. When drawn off for use, 
as much water must be added as the brandy 
was overproof, and the cherries must be af- 
terward pressed as long as any liquor re- 
mains in them before being cast away. 
When drawn off the second time, the liquor 
will be somewhat inferior to the first, when 
more sugar, with a very little cinnamon and 
cloves beaten, may be added. 

CHERRY BRANDY, NO. 3 

To every five gallons of brandy made by 
the recipe for French brandy add one and 
one-half quarts of wild black cherries, 
stones and all bruised, one pound of crushed 
sugar. Let it stand for one week, then draw 
or rack it off as it is wanted for use.

CHERRY BRANDY, NO. 4 

To every four quarts of brandy put four 
pounds of red cherries, two pounds of black, 
one quart of raspberries, with a few cloves, 
a stick of cinnamon, and a little orange 
peel. Let these stand a month close 
stopped; then bottle it off, putting a lump 
of sugar into every bottle. 

CHERRY BRANDY, NO. 5 

Take twelve pounds of cherries, half red 
and half black, mash or squeeze them to 
pieces with the hands, and add to them two 
quarts of brandy, letting them steep for 
twenty-four hours. Then put the mashed 
cherries and liquor into a canvas bag, a 
little at a time, and press it as long as it 
will run. Sweeten it with loaf sugar and let 
it stand a month; then bottle it off, putting 
a lump of sugar in every bottle. 

LEMON BRANDY 

Put two and one-half quarts of water in 
one-half gallon of brandy. Take one dozen 
114

of lemons, one pound of the best sugar, and 
one and one-half pints of milk. Pare the 
lemons very thin, and lay the peel to steep 
in the brandy twelve hours. Squeeze the 
lemons upon the sugar, then put the water 
to it, and mix all the ingredients together. 
Boil the milk and pour it in boiling. Let it 
stand twenty-four hours and then strain it. 

ORANGE BRANDY 

Put the chips of six Seville oranges in 
one quart of brandy, and let them steep a 
fortnight in a stone bottle close stopped. 
Boil two and two-thirds pints of spring 
water with eight ounces of the finest sugar, 
nearly an hour, very gently. Clarify the 
water and sugar with the white of an egg; 
then strain it through a jelly-bag, and boil 
it nearly half-away. When it is cold, strain 
the brandy into the syrup. 

POPPY BRANDY 

Take six quarts of the best and freshest 
poppies, cut off the black ends, put them in 
a glass jar that will hold two gallons, and 
press them in it, then pour over a gallon of 
brandy. Tightly cover the glass jar and set 
it in the sun for a week or more, then 
squeeze out the poppies with your hand, and

sweeten the liquor to taste, adding an ounce 
and a half of alkermes. Mix it well and bot- 
tle it up. 

RASPBERRY BRANDY 

Raspberry brandy is infused nearly after 
the same manner as cherry brandy, and 
drawn off with about the same addition of 
brandy to what is drawn off from the first, 
second, and third infusion, and dulcified ac- 
cordingly, first making it of a bright deep 
color, omitting cinnamon and cloves in the 
first, but not in the second and third infu- 
sion. The second infusion will be somewhat 
paler than the first, and must be lightened 
in color by adding one pint cherry brandy, 
with five or more gallons of raspberry 
brandy, and the third infusion will require 
more cherry brandy to color it. It may be 
flavored with the juice of elderberry. 

RASPBERRY BRANDY, NO. 2 

Take a pint of water and two quarts of 
brandy, and put them into a pitcher large 
enough to hold them and four pints of rasp-

covered. Then take a piece of flannel with 
a piece of holland over it, and let it run

RASPBERRY BRANDY, NO. 3 

Scald the fruit in a stone jar set in a 
kettle of water, or on a hot hearth. When 
the juice will run freely, strain it without

pound of loaf sugar. Boil it up and skim ; 
when quite clear pour out, and when cold 
add an equal quantity of brandy. Shake 
them well together and bottle.

CORDIALS 



CORDIALS 

To filter cordials, cover the bottom of a 
sieve with clean blotting-paper. Pour the 
liquor into it (having set a vessel under- 
neath to receive it), and let drip through the 
paper and through the sieve. Renew the 
paper frequently and fasten it down with 
pins. This process is slow, but makes the 
liquor beautifully clear. 

TO MAKE ANISE - SEED CORDIAL 

Take one-half pound bruised anise-seed, 
three gallons proof spirit, one quart of 
water. Draw off two gallons, with a moder- 
ate fire. This water should never be reduced 
below proof, because the large quantity of 
oil with which it is impregnated will render 
it milky and foul when brought down below 
proof. But if there is a necessity for doing 
this the transparency may be restored by 
filtration. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL 

Mash and strain the berries through 
sieve. To one gallon of juice put one pound

pint of good brandy or whiskey. 

CARAWAY CORDIAL 

Take one teaspoonful of oil of caraway, 
four drops of cassia-lignea oil, one drop of 
essence of orange peel, one drop of essence 
of lemon, five quarts and a gill of spirits, 
one and three-fourths pounds of loaf sugar. 
Make it up and fine it down.

CEDRAT CORDIAL 

The cedrat is a species of citron, and very 
highly esteemed in Italy, where it grows 
naturally. The fruit is difficult to be pro- 
cured in this country, but as the essential 
oil is often imported from Italy, it may be 
made as follows: Take two ounces of the 
finest loaf sugar, powdered. Put it into a 
glass mortar, with sixty drops of the essence 
of cedrat; rub them together with a glass 
pestle, and put them into a glass alembic 
with two quarts of fine proof spirit and one 
pint of water. Place the alembic in a bath, 
heat and draw off one-half gallon, or till 
the feints begin to rise; then dulcify with 
fine sugar. 

This is considered the finest cordial yet 
known; it will therefore be necessary to be 
particularly careful that the spirit is per- 
fectly clean, and as much as possible free 
from any flavor of its own. 

CINNAMON CORDIAL 

This is seldom made with cinnamon, but 
with either the essential oil or bark of 
cassia. It is preferred colored, and there- 
fore may be well prepared by simple fermen- 
tation. If the oil be used, one dram will be 
found enough for two or three gallons of 
123 



?l^otn^ i[»atr( 2i!Sifntsi 

spirit. The addition of two or three drops 
each of essence of lemon and orange peel, 
with about a spoonful of essence of carda- 
moms to each gallon, will improve it. Some 
persons add to the above quantity one 
dram of cardamom seeds and one ounce each 
of dried orange and lemon peel. One ounce 
of oil of cassia is considered to be equal to 
eight pounds of the buds or bark. If wanted 
dark, it may be colored with burnt sugar. 
The quantity of sugar is one and one-half 
pounds to the gallon. 

STRONG CINNAMON CORDIAL 

Take one pound of fine cinnamon bruised, 
two gallons of clear rectified spirit, and one 
pint of water. Put them into the still, and 
digest them twenty-four hours with a gentle 
heat, after which draw off by a pretty 
strong heat. 

CITRON CORDIAL 

Take six ounces of dry yellow rinds of 
citrons, two ounces of orange peel, one and 
one-half ounces bruised nutmegs, five quarts 
of proof spirit, one pint water. Digest 
with a gentle heat, then draw off ten gal- 
lons in a bath; heat, and dulcify with fine 
sugar.

CITRON CORDIAL, NO. 2 

One-half pound yellow rind of citrons, 
two ounces orange peel, one-third ounce 
bruised nutmegs, two and one-sixth gallons 
proof spirit; distill or macerate, add water 
sufficient, and one-half pound of fine lump 
sugar for every gallon of the cordial. 

CLOVE CORDIAL 

Take one-quarter of a pound of cloves, 
bruised, one ounce pimento, or allspice, two 
gallons proof spirit. Digest the mixture 
twelve hours in a gentle heat, and then draw 
off with a pretty brisk fire. The water may 
be colored red, either by strong tincture of 
cochineal, alkanet, or corn poppy-flowers. 
It may be dulcified at pleasure with refined 
sugar. 

CLOVE CORDIAL, NO. « 

One-quarter ounce bruised cloves, or one- 
quarter dram essential oil, to every gal- 
lon of proof spirit. If distilled, it should 
be drawn over with a pretty quick fire. It 
is preferred of a very deep color, and is 
therefore strongly colored with poppy-flow- 
ers or cochineal, or more commonly with 
brandy coloring, or red sanders wood. It 
should have three pounds of sugar to the 
125 



^omt iWatrt WLint^ 

gallon, and this need not be very fine. The 
addition of one-quarter dram of bruised 
pimento, or two drops of the oil for every 
ounce of cloves, improves this cordial. 



CORIANDER CORDIAL 

One-third pound coriander seeds, one- 
third ounce of caraways, and the peel and 
juice of one-half orange to every gallon of 
proof spirit. 



GINGER CORDIAL 

Pick one pound of large white currants 
from their stalks, lay them in a basin, and 
strew over them the rind of an orange and 
a lemon cut very thin, or one-half teaspoon- 
ful of essence of lemon, and one ounce and 
one-half of the best ground ginger, and one 
quart of good whiskey. Let all lie for 
twenty-four hours. If it taste strong of the 
ginger, then strain it; if not, let it lie for 
twelve hours longer. To every quart of 
strained juice add one pound of loaf sugar 
pounded. When the sugar is quite dis- 
solved, and the liquor appears clear, bottle 
it. This cordial is also extremely good 
made with raspberries instead of currants.

linen, fastened to the mouth of the worm 
one-quarter ounce of English saffron. Then 
dissolve two pounds of sugar in one and 
one-half pints of rose-water, and add to it

rives its name from a quantity of leaf gold 
being formerly added to it, but this is now 
generally disused.

some fine lemons. Cut the lemons in half 
and squeeze out the juice. To each pint of 
the juice allow one-half pound of loaf sugar. 
Mix the juice, the peel, and the sugar to- 
gether. Cover it and let it set twenty-four 
hours. Then mix it with an equal quantity 
of white brandy. Put it into a jug, and let

pound of sweet almonds. Add the thinly 
pared rind of two lemons, three tablespoon- 
fuls of boiled milk which has become cold. 
Put all together into a jar, and add two 
quarts of old whiskey. Cork up the jar, and 
let it stand for six weeks, shaking the jar 
every day. At the end of that time strain 
the liquor, and to every quart of the liquor 
add three pints of clarified syrup, and filter 
through blotting-paper. The almonds that 
are strained from the hquor make a nice fla- 
voring for puddings, by putting them into 
a wide-mouthed bottle and pouring whiskey 
over them. 

ORANGE CORDIAL 

Take five pounds of the yellow part of 
fresh orange peel, ten and one-half gallons

Pare your quinces, and scrape them to the 
core. Put all the scrapings into a tureen, 
and see that there are no seeds among them. 
Let the scrapings remain covered in the 
tureen for two days; then put them into a 
linen bag and squeeze out all the juice. 
Measure it and mix it with an equal quantity 
of white brandy. To each pint of the mix- 
ture add one-half pound of loaf sugar and 
130 



Jl^omt Jttatre WLinm 



a little cinnamon and cloves. Put it into 
a jug and let it infuse for two months. Drain 
it through blotting-paper and then bottle 
it. This cordial improves with age and is 
excellent. 



ROSE CORDIAL 

Take one pound of the leaves of full-blown 
red roses. Put them into one quart of luke- 
warm water, and let them infuse for two days 
in a covered vessel. Then squeeze them 
through a linen bag, to press out all the 
liquid, and take as much white brandy as 
you have of the decoction of roses. To one 
pint of the infusion add one-half pound of 
loaf sugar, and a very small quantity of co- 
riander and cinnamon. Put in a jug and let 
it set for two weeks, then filter it through 
blotting-paper, and put it into bottles. 

RASPBERRY CORDIAL

one-half pint of cherry juice, the fruit hav- 
ing been squeezed through a linen bag after 
the cherries have been stoned. Mix the juices 
together, and dissolve in them two pounds 
of loaf sugar. Then add two quarts of 
French brandy. Put it into a jug and let

it stand five weeks. Afterward strain it and 
bottle for use. 

STRAWBERRY OR RASPBERRY COR- 
DIAL 

Sugar down the berries overnight, using 
more sugar than you would for the table, 
about half as much again. In the morning 
lay them in a hair sieve over the basin ; let 
them remain until evening, so as to thor- 
oughly drain. Then put the juice in a thick 
flannel bag ; let it drain all night, being care- 
ful not to squeeze it, as that takes out the 
brightness and clearness. All this should be 
done in a cool cellar, or it will be apt to sour. 
Add brandy in the proportion of one-third 
the quantity of juice, and as much more 
sugar as the taste demands. Bottle it 
tightly. It will keep six or eight years, and 
is better at last than at first. 



WHISKEY CORDIAL 

Take one ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of 
ginger, one ounce of coriander seed, one-half 
ounce of mace, one-half ounce of cloves, one- 
half ounce of cubebs. Add three gallons of
