PREFACE 

* * 

Each year brings me thousands of letters from house- 
wives all over the country, as well as from Canada and 
Mexico, and many from the old world. Some of them 
contain requests for recipes, but the majority ask for 
help in solving home problems of finance, the prepara- 
tion of food, the saving of time and energy, and the 
institution of the balanced ration as a means toward 
economy and better family health. Many others ask 
about proper service, and what foods should be com- 
bined; but not a few contain a little heart-break, and 
many of them end in this wise, " If I had only been 
taught how to cook, and how to do housework when I 
was a girl, instead of growing up in ignorance and selfish- 
ness, how much easier my life would be now, and how 
much more effective I should be as a mother, a wife 
and a housekeeper ! " 

In presenting this book the burden of my message is: 
Let every mother realize that she holds in her hands the 
health of the family and the welfare and the progress of 
her husband. It is she who helps to make brain and 
brawn. There is no magic in the work she does. There 
are no mortars and pestles, there are no test tubes and 
Bunsen burners. Her chemicals are foods pure and 
simple, her equipment, bowls and pans, kettles and a 
range. With these aids she must evolve a good family 
health, and in so doing contribute to the health and wel- 
fare of the nation. 

It is a wonderful thing to be a woman ; it is a wonder- 
ful thing to be a wife, but most of all it is wonderful 
to be a mother, and the woman who realizes her priv- 
ileges and knows that her daily work is not drudgery, 
but that it is constructive in the truest sense of the word, 
and who does this work with love and pride in her heart, 
is fulfilling the highest destiny that a woman can have. 

If I were to make a plea, I should ask that every 



PREFACE 

woman in this country, whether she has the vote, or 
whether she is merely depending upon personal influence, 
should try her utmost to introduce courses in domestic 
economy in every school in both city and country, in 
every prison and in every reformatory. 

If I were to put forth a request, it would be that every 
woman in this country make herself a " pal " and friend 
of her daughters and her sons, and that from little baby- 
hood up she teach them the interesting processes of home 
work and cookery, so that there will be a sound founda- 
tion for the homes that are to come and an already es- 
tablished knowledge that will make possible glorious 
home partnership and splendid health for the genera- 
tions that are to be. 

The author wishes to acknowledge her indebtedness to 
the Ladies' Home Journal, Pictorial Review, Good House- 
keeping, the Delineator, Country Gentleman, the Boston 
Cooking School Magazine, the North American, and the 
Ohio State Journal for their kindness in allowing re- 
prints of her various articles which have been published 
in their columns, and for the privilege of reproducing 
photographs which have been used from time to time in 
their pages.

INTRODUCTION 

A well rounded dietary is the only sensible one. While 
we should eat to live instead of reversing the process, 
care in selection and judgment in preparation make our 
dietetic choice a matter of pleasure and profit as well as 
of duty. 

The chemical composition of the body requires foods 
of similar composition. The author of this book in a 
delightfully simple manner has presented the problem so 
that, generally speaking, the body may extract from the 
foods the maximum amount of building and fuel mate- 
rial with the least expenditure of dynamic energy. 

The housewife who studies these chapters cannot fail 
to find suggestions adaptable, economical and hygienic. 

It will, of course, be understood that no class of food 
performs a strictly simple function. For example, while 
proteins are building foods, they also furnish a consider- 
able amount of heat or energy. Likewise, fats and oils 
furnish energy and, to some extent, assist in tissue-build- 
ing. In other words, any food is likely to react outside 
its own class. 

Mrs. Allen has expressed in popular terms a simple, 
workable outline of food combination, well adapted to 
the needs of the housewife. If her book is carefully fol- 
lowed, the dietary of the average family will be much 
improved, cost decreased, and a general gain in health 
experienced.

MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 



CHAPTER I 

THE EVERYDAY CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND 
COOKERY 

THE BALANCED RATION 

Every housewife is the mistress of the destiny of her 
family. In the foods which she prepares and serves 
she has the power to build strong, healthy bodies, the 
bedrock of brilliant minds, to furnish energy for work 
and life, and to create a reserve against worry and dis- 
ease. Within her hands she holds the glorious manhood 
and splendid womanhood of to-morrow. 

The balanced ration furnishes the solution of the 
house-mother's difficult problem in providing the right 
food for the needs of her family. As usually explained 
the problem of the balanced ration seems so difficult, 
technical, and obscure, that the average woman, although 
anxious to place her cookery on a scientific basis, be- 
comes appalled by the host of technical terms and numer- 
ical calculations and finally abandons all attempt at 
science and falls back into the old routine of unscientific 
cooking. Nevertheless the problem is really simple, and 
can be worked out for each individual family by the ex- 
penditure of a little time and thought at no extra cost, 
for the balanced ration tends to reduce the food bills. 

But first, what is the balanced ration? It is simply 
the correct combination into meals of the proper amounts 
of food and the proper food constituents in such ways 
as to please both the eye and the palate, appease the 
hunger, furnish each section of the body the food re- 
quired for energy, and allow for the storing-up of re- 
serve force against the time of need. 

Our bodies are made of many different elements, 
which, in conjunction with water, combine to form flesh, 
bone, blood, and so on. But each time a motion is made, 
a thought flashed in the brain, or even a word spoken, a 



2 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

small part of the body tissue is broken down or ex- 
hausted. This waste is carried off through the pores of 
the skin and by the excretory organs, but there Nature 
pauses. She cannot mend a break without material, and, 
just as the plumber needs solder, she requires food to re- 
pair the wornout tissues. As the body is so complex, 
a wide variety of foods is needed in order that there 
may be sufficient material to repair each part. This is 
one reason why human beings crave variety in their food 
and thrive best upon a mixed diet. 

The housewife, in working out her food problem, may 
classify foods in the following six groups of constituents : 

1. Proteins, or Muscle- Makers as beef, lean pork, 
mutton, poultry, lamb, veal, game, cheese, nuts, milk, 
eggs, fish, dried peas, dried beans, lentils and milk soups. 

2. Carbohydrates, or Fuels including starches and 
sweets. 

A. Starchy Foods as potatoes and all starchy veg- 
etables, macaroni, spaghetti, noodles and the like, cooked 
and prepared cereals, bread, muffins, biscuits, crackers, 
bananas, cocoa, corn starch and tapioca puddings, cereal 
puddings and so on. 

B. Sweets as cakes, frostings, candies, rich pre- 
serves, jellies, rich breads (as coffee cake), cookies, 
sweet puddings, stewed fruit, honey, maple syrup and 
other sugary foods. 

3. Fats, or Reserve-Force Foods as fat ham, pork, 
bacon, fat fish, sausages, cream soups, full milk cheese, 
cream cheese, olive-, corn- and peanut-oil, ripe olives, 
mayonnaise and all salad dressings, rich gravies and 
sauces, rich pastry, most nuts, suet puddings, fritters and 
all foods cooked in fat, sweet chocolate, ice cream made 
with cream, mousse, parfaits and Bavarian creams. 

4. Minerals and Acids as cucumbers, corn, toma- 
toes, cabbage, celery, egg plant, spinach and all greens, 
salad plants, prunes, figs, rhubarb and all dried and fresh 
fruits. 

5. Bulky Foods, or Cleansers as all mineral foods, 
coarse breads, woody vegetables, gritty cereals and bran 
foods. 

6. Liquids, or Dissolvent Foods as water, stock and 
milk soups, broths, tea, coffee, skimmed milk, whey, but- 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 3 

termilk, fruit drinks, gelatines, water ices, frappes, sher- 
bets and watery fruits and vegetables. 

While this classification is only a general one, it is 
sufficiently accurate and practical to enable any house- 
wife to place her cookery on a scientific basis without 
any trouble or abstruse calculations. All foods contain 
certain properties, as proteins possess a small proportion 
of heat-giving properties, while most carbohydrates con- 
tain a trace, or more, of protein. For convenience's sake 
in planning a balanced ration each food must be grouped 
according to its predominating characteristic, for the un- 
derlying principle in the preparation of food lies in cook- 
ing properly the ruling constituent, as protein in proteins, 
starch in carbohydrates, and so on, at the same time 
retaining as much of the total food value as possible. 

In arranging meals the principal or main dish should 
usually be a protein food a roast, baked eggs, a rare- 
bit, or any food from the muscle-making group. Then 
come the carbohydrates (starches and sugars), the fats 
(as butter, olive oil and the like), the minerals (in the 
form of fresh fruits or vegetables) and the bland and 
" filling foods," listed under the dissolvent or bulky 
group (as stock soup, gelatine, apples, and so on). 

If the wrong foods are prepared and served, it is al- 
most as easy to starve in the midst of plenty, as when 
there is nothing to eat, and Nature creates a feeling of 
dissatisfaction which results in a constant appetite, or 
a craving, for the lacking food. A mother was utterly 
discouraged because she could not seem to provide her 
athletic boy of fifteen with enough to eat. One night, 
after eating ten slices of bread and butter, three helpings 
of potato salad, six slices of cake, and three dishes of 
preserves, he was rummaging in the pantry a half hour 
after supper for " something to eat." She finally de- 
cided that he was not being supplied with the right kind 
of food, so she studied dietetics and the balanced ration, 
and instituted scientific meals. The boy's appetite be- 
came normal almost at once. He was starving on starch, 
while all his healthy young muscles demanded their por- 
tion of protein. 

A meal often leaves a craving sense of incompleteness, 
caused by a similarity in flavor in all the foods served. 



4 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

A small quantity of any of the vividly seasoned foods 
furnishes an appetizer. For convenience the foods suit- 
able for use in this way may be termed " esthetic foods," 
and include all condiments, pickles, green olives, chili 
sauce, ketchup, crystallized ginger, green peppers, pimen- 
toes, sour oranges and fruits, tart jellies, lemon juice, 
wintergreen and peppermint candies and so forth. The 
esthetic touch may be added to any course desirable, al- 
though it relieves monotony if it appears midway of 
the meal. If the esthetic touch is added properly, the 
whole meal assumes point and every food fits into its 
niche. 

In planning any meal the bulky group of food constitu- 
ents must predominate in quantity; starches should ap- 
pear second, the proteins third, sweets fourth and fats 
fifth, while the liquid group should be sufficient to act as 
a dissolving agent. In general, two starches should 
figure in a meal, one protein, one fat besides butter, at 
least one bulky food, one mineral, or more if desirable, 
one sweet, and a dissolvent besides water. If foods are 
apportioned in this way, in quantities of the usual " help- 
ing," suited to the occupation and age of each member 
of the family, second portions will seldom be requested; 
when each part of the body is receiving adequate nourish- 
ment, less food is needed. 

The food of each meal should be suitable for the needs 
of each member of the family. Briefly, the man at hard 
labor and the active boy from twelve years up require 
hearty foods that " stick to the ribs " usually meaning 
those consuming a long time in digestion ; the housewife, 
active school girls from twelve years on, and men at 
sedentary occupations need lighter food or that more 
easily digested; while children from four to eight and 
old people need a fair quantity of simple food. Children 
under four demand small quantities of easily digested 
foods, supplemented by plenty of minerals and milk, 
while the child from eight to twelve may eat the usual 
family meal in quantities suited to his growth and ac- 
tivity. No matter whether the income is large or small 
the balanced ration can always be maintained. Jt must 
be borne in mind that beyond a certain point the cost of 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY- 5 

food is for flavor and luxuries rather than for the neces- 
sities of diet. 

A day's menu for a family, consisting of a father at 
clerical work, a mother who acts as housekeeper, an 'ath- 
letic son, a girl of ten, and a child of four, might be as 
follows : 

Breakfast 

Coddled Apples, B, 4, 5, 6 

Cracked Wheat, A, 5 

Light Cream, 3 

Baked Eggs, i 

Popovers, A, and Butter, 3 

Coffee (for grown-ups), 6 

Luncheon or Supper 

Cream of Tomato Soup, i, 6 

Escalloped Cheese, i 
Bread, A, and Butter, 3 

Lettuce Salad, with Shredded Peppers and Oil Dressing, 3, 4, 6 
Steamed Whole Wheat Pudding, A Raisin Sauce, B 

Tea, 6 

Dinner 

Clear Soup, 6 

Lamb with Gravy, i, 3 Boiled Rice, A 

Cabbage Slaw, with Minced Mint, 3, 4 

Baked Parsnips, A 

Sliced Oranges in Jelly, B, 4, 5 

Tea, 6 

The numbers following each item refer back to the 
table of food constituents, proteins being called i ; 
starches A ; sweets B ; fats 3 ; minerals 4 ; bulky foods 5 
and liquids 6. Some of the foods may be included in 
two or more classifications; in this case several numbers 
appear after each item. 

These menus are roughly balanced, and approximate 
dietetic standards in so far as is practicable. A sufficient 
quantity of sugar is added in preparing coddled apples to 
classify them as sweet (B), but at the same time they are 
mineral (4), ballast (5), and liquid (6). Cream of 
tomato soup is at once a protein (i), because of the milk 
it contains, and a dissolvent (6), because it is a liquid. 
A knowledge of cookery and familiarization with the 



6 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

table of food constituents given above will enable anyone 
to classify all foods in their relation to the balanced 
ration. 

In these special menus each food constituent appears 
in correct proportion, and every member of the imagin- 
ary family can obtain from them the foods suited to his 
or her needs. The. cracked wheat at breakfast is suffi- 
ciently bulky to " stand by " the athletic son, who will 
doubtless eat steadily through the meal. The father and 
mother will eat smaller quantities because they are not 
so active and burn less energy, while the girl of ten will 
probably be satisfied with a choice of either eggs or 
cereal. The four-year-old child should be given either 
eggs or cereal, but not both. Milk 'is also needed, if the 
cereal serves as his main dish. As he is too young to 
eat hot breads, a slice of bread and butter may be sub- 
stituted for the popovers. The same common sense dis- 
posal may be made at the other meals. 

PROTEINS, THEIR PREPARATION AND PLACE 
IN THE MENU 

The part which the proteins should play in the balanced 
ration is the most serious consideration in arranging a 
diet. If insufficient protein is taken, the body cannot 
grow or build up the wornout parts ; while, if too much 
is taken, the result is serious disease. As a matter of 
fact many of the so-called degenerative diseases are 
traced to too much protein in the diet. So the selection 
of protein foods involves considerable thought. Another 
cause for thought is that many foods analyze a large 
proportion of protein that is not digestible and we live 
upon what we digest, irrespective of what we eat. 
Mushrooms, for example, contain a certain amount of 
protein, but it is in such form that the body cannot 
digest it all. The outer layers of certain grains contain 
considerable protein, yet, as it cannot be assimilated, the 
nutritional value of this part of the grain is chiefly in the 
mineral matter which is also present. As these foods 
contain a large amount of waste material, they are also 
of value as " ballast " in the diet. 

The following foods may be roughly classified as pro- 
teins : 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 7 

Beef, poultry, game, pork, lamb, mutton, veal, cheese, 
nuts, milk, eggs, fish, dried beans, peas, lentils and milk 
soups. 

All dishes which consist largely of any of these foods 
also belong to this classification, so that the possibilities 
of presenting protein in the diet are considerable. Many 
housewives have the idea that only savory dishes, suitable 
for the main portion of a meal, are proteins, but this 
idea is erroneous. Any of these foods, whether in a 
sweet, a salad, or a soup, is a protein. For instance, 
dried lima-bean soup, chicken salad, escalloped beef, 
baked egg custard, cheese souffle, or nut croquettes are 
all proteins, and if they are not so considered in the 
menu, the body may rebel and become heir to the ills 
attending a diet too rich in protein. This is not difficult 
when the common error of serving meat three times a 
day is made. It is obvious that with so wide a variety 
of protein foods from which to choose there should be 
no trouble in planning menus in which meat figures but 
once a day. 

The statement is frequently made that the protein 
value in three eggs, three ounces of cheese, two ounces of 
salted peanuts, or a pint of milk equals that in five ounces 
of meat. While this may be true, it is impracticable 
to serve many of these meat substitutes uncombined, for, 
unless they are supplemented by some food which serves 
as ballast, they do not contain a bulk equalling that of 
meat. Most people feel that the satisfying of hunger 
consists in eating until the stomach is full, and this 
cannot be done on a concentrated diet, as overeating 
and illness result. If the cheese is escalloped with 
coarse crumbs, the peanuts hash-browned with potatoes, 
the eggs creamed and served on toast, the milk solidified 
into junket or enforced with oatmeal or whole wheat 
crackers, the ballast will be supplied and the body satis- 
fied. The reason that meat substitutes are not more 
generally used is probably because most women fail to 
grasp this point, and a single trial of the so-called sub- 
stitutes, plain or not properly combined, convinces them 
that " their family would rather have meat " and they 
turn back to their former ways. 

The selection of protein best suited to the menu de- 



8 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

pends largely upon the family. The more digestible 
types are advisable for those doing light work, the 
" heartier," or less digestible foods for those of greater 
activity. 

The digestibility of a few more common foods may be 
noted roughly as follows: 

QUICKLY DIGESTED SLOWLY DIGESTED 

(One to three hours) (Three to five hours) 

Milk Pork in all forms 

Broiled -tripe Veal in all forms 

Turkey Nuts in all forms 

Broiled chicken, lamb chops Cheese in all forms 

and steak Mushrooms 

Broiled, poached, scrambled Pot-roast of beef 

and coddled eggs Casserole dishes 

Baked custard Hard-cooked and fried eggs 

Broiled trout, halibut and sal- and omelets 

mon Stews 

Boiled cod, halibut and salmon Fried meats of all kinds 

Salt codfish, baked or creamed All "made dishes" of meats 

Oysters, raw or baked in shell Fried fish of all kinds 

Boiled beef Mackerel, sardines, canned sal- 
mon, and all fat fish 
Lentils, peas and beans 

This raises the most important point in connection 
with proteins their cookery for it is possible to make 
a food that is otherwise digestible difficult of digestion by 
improper cooking, and to make those so-called " indi- 
gestible " much more palatable and nutritious by the 
right treatment. To a considerable extent perfect diges- 
tion depends on perfect cooking, and on the same con- 
sideration hinges the greatest possibility for absorption 
of nutriment. Food that is not digested is wasted ; a 
human machine clogged with the wastes of indigestion 
is inefficient. However, in searching for digestible 
foods any tendency to " pamper " or " spare " the diges- 
tive organs of a normal person should be avoided. The 
whole body needs exercise the stomach, liver and in- 
testines, as well as the legs and arms, and, while they 
should not be overloaded, they should not be given a 
diet of eggs, milk and predigested foods on which they 
will become weakened. 

The cooking of all protein foods is alike in that they 
should neyer be subjected to high temperatures, as this 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 9 

has a hardening effect on the protein element, making 
it indigestible. If an egg, for instance, is boiled or 
poached in rapidly boiling water for four minutes, the 
white becomes opaque and leathery, while, if the time 
is slightly increased and the egg is immersed in water 
just below the boiling point, it becomes perfectly cooked, 
having a jellied, translucent appearance. 

It may be given, then, as a rule, that eggs should al- 
ways be cooked at the lowest possible temperature. If 
eggs are to be hard-cooked, the only way to avoid the 
unpleasant chemical changes brought about by the usual 
prolonged cooking is to put them on in cold water, bring 
them slowly to the boiling point, boil rapidly for ten min- 
utes, then plunge at once into cold water to stop all fur- 
ther cooking. This is the only case when an egg, as a 
protein food, should be boiled. Scrambled eggs, as usu- 
ally served, are leathery and indigestible, because they 
are turned into melted butter in a pan so hot that the 
eggs are not only coagulated immediately, but are fried 
as well. Properly, the mixture should be turned into a 
cold, thick frying pan, the lump of butter added, and the 
whole cooked so gently that the result is creamy. Fried 
eggs and omelets should also be cooked slowly. A per- 
fectly fried egg cannot be prepared under five minutes, 
while an omelet of fair size needs ten. Custards and 
desserts of all kinds, containing eggs, should be sur- 
rounded by boiling water while cooking, as this keeps 
the temperature below boiling point. Otherwise they 
will " curd," or, in other words, the eggs will cook in 
lumps. 

Fish consists of a considerable proportion of protein, 
yet there is probably no other food so maltreated. The 
majority of people " do not care for fish," but in how 
many cases is it ever served other than fried or boiled? 
If the former method is used, the delicate flavor and tex- 
ture is usually overcome by the hot fat ; if the latter, the 
fish is " cooked to death." If fish must be fried, let it 
be in deep fat. The high heat will immediately coagu- 
late the outside protein cells, preventing the escape of 
juices, while the cold fish will reduce the temperature 
sufficiently to carry on the process slowly. In boiling 
(a misleading term) fish should be started in water just 



io MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

at boiling point; for, as the protein of fish is soluble in 
cold or merely warm water, it will otherwise be lost. 
If it be wrapped in a cloth and the complete cooking car- 
ried on at simmering-point (as with the boiled eggs), the 
fish will present a " jellied " appearance, be very tender 
and remain whole. If boiled rapidly, it is not only 
" cooked to pieces " but the breaking open causes the 
loss of both flavor and part of the protein. In boiling, 
the fish should be subjected to high heat only long enough 
to seal the outside. The same rule also applies to plank- 
ing. In no case should the process be hurried. 

Meats may be cooked in various ways, boiling, broil- 
ing, stewing, pot-roasting, braizing, roasting and casserol- 
ing being the most common. " Boiled beef," properly 
prepared, is one of the juiciest and most digestible of 
meats, but, like fish, it must never be actually boiled. 
Again, though different in appearance, meat contains 
practically the same protein as eggs and fish, and, if 
boiled, becomes tough and leathery. The protein of 
meats, like that of fish, is soluble in cold water, so they 
should always be plunged into boiling water to seal, or 
" sear," the pores, in order to preserve the protein, then 
simmered gently till done. In this way the juices will be 
retained and the meat become tender and gelatinized. 
In preparing a five-pound piece it will be necessary to 
increase the time of cooking about an hour over the 
old method. The fireless cooker is a successful medium 
for preparing tough meats, because it necessitates a slow 
process. The resulting stock will be thin and rather 
" flat," because the flavors have been retained in the 
meat, which is of first importance. In stewing, on the 
other hand, the meat and liquor are of equal importance ; 
so the meat is immersed in cold water, and brought 
slowly to the simmering point, in order to make the broth 
of strong flavor. In this way the juices are divided be- 
tween the meat and the broth, making the stew more 
palatable. Casserole cooking is merely baking a stew in 
an earthen dish. Pot-roasting is modified boiling, the 
meat being first browned or seared all over in fat to keep 
in the juices, then added, with the vegetables and spices, 
to boiling water sufficient to cover it half over. It should 
never boil. 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY II 

In broiling or pan-broiling, meat should be subjected 
to heat sufficient to sear it quickly, then turned immedi- 
ately to sear the other portions, lest the juices escape. 
As most meat for broiling is cut crosswise, the fibers con- 
taining the meat fluids are left exposed. Unless the 
searing be quick and complete, these juices will escape, 
the result being a flat, tasteless meat. If, however, the 
searing is thorough, and the meat is turned frequently, 
the juices run back and forth in the fibers, which expand 
with the heat until the meat assumes a puffy appearance. 
In roasting, meat is exposed to a very hot heat till seared, 
all over, then finished at a lower temperature. 

Cheese is another protein that requires careful cook- 
ing. It consists largely of casein, the protein of milk, 
and, like all the other foods in this group, is rendered 
indigestible by high temperatures. This is the reason it 
disagrees with many. If baked, it should always be set 
in a pan of hot water ; if in a rarebit or cheese sauce, it 
should be cooked in a double boiler ; either method keeps 
it below the boiling point. In case it is to be added to 
soup or macaroni, the dish should be fully prepared be- 
fore the addition, the heat being sufficient to melt the 
cheese. If served plain, it should be finely shaved, or 
cut in small pieces, and some bulky food should always 
accompany it. 

Dried peas, beans and lentils should always be soaked 
several hours before cooking, thoroughly rinsed, and 
then simmered until tender. Again, it takes slow-cook- 
ing to make the protein digestible. A little baking soda, 
added while cooking, aids in softening the husks and 
overcoming the gases that frequently attend the eating 
of dried vegetables. 



CARBOHYDRATES AND FATS 

THEIR PREPARATION AND PLACE IN THE 

MENU 

Just as the protein builds muscle, the carbohydrate ful- 
fills the great mission of acting as fuel for the body, 
thus providing heat and activity and energy for work. 
Without this food constituent, the body would become 



12 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

lazy, chilly and inert, while oxidation digesting 
could not take place. 

The list of carbohydrates which includes both 
starches and sugars is extensive. The following foods 
may be listed as starches : All vegetables which contain 
a noticeable amount of starch and sugar, ^s white pota- 
toes, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, beets, melons, 
sweet corn, and squash ; all cereals, both ready-to-eat and 
cooked, including rice, samp, macaroni, spaghetti, ver- 
micelli and noodles ; bread, all muffins, biscuits and crack- 
ers; bananas and corn starch; arrowroot, cereal and 
tapioca . puddings. Sugars include all foods made very 
sweet : as cakes, most pies, f rostings, candies, rich pre- 
serves, stewed fruits, jellies, sweet puddings, rich breads 
(as coffee cake), cookies, Barbadoes or other molasses, 
honey and maple and corn syrup. 

iThis classification must not be misunderstood, for it is 
only general in scope. Most carbohydrate foods contain 
some protein and some fat. A cake made from eggs 
w r hich contain both protein and fat will contribute 
a proportion of both constituents to the dish. 

Starches in the raw state are largely indigestible and 
cannot be absorbed by the body. Thorough cooking 
converts the starch into a sweet substance similar to 
sugar and renders it digestible. In case the cookery is 
incomplete, as in half-cooked cereals, the starch, instead 
of being used in the body, goes through the digestive 
canal, irritating the stomach and intestines and fre- 
quently causing accumulations of gas. Just as plain 
starch cannot be prepared for laundry purposes without 
the addition of boiling water to burst the grains, so is 
this addition necessary in cooking all starchy foods, un- 
less they contain a large amount of water in themselves. 
For this reason cereals cannot be cooked without the 
medium of water or other liquid, while potatoes, which 
are composed of considerable water, can be cooked either 
with or without water. 

Cereals are the cheapest and most nourishing of the 
fuel foods. As they consist of approximately three- 
fourths starch, they are distinctly carbohydrates, al- 
though oats, wheat, rye and corn contain about ten per 



\ 

CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 13 

cent of protein, and even rice, though mostly starch, has 
eight per cent of protein. 

Bread, both ordinary white and whole wheat, contains 
so large a percentage of starch that it must be classi- 
fied as a carbohydrate. Bread has a place peculiarly 
its own in the diet, but when enormous quantities are 
consumed at a meal it denotes one of two things it 
is eaten through custom or because the meal is unbal- 
anced. 

In considering sweets, the place of pure molasses, 
honey and maple syrup should be noted. They are 
wholesome foods, and a meal supplemented by warm 
biscuits and honey, or browned mush and syrup, instead 
of the usual heavy dessert, is not only more wholesome 
but more enjoyable. Pure candy deserves a place in the 
diet, and, when properly used, may supplement the menu. 
Sugar is a source of quick energy, and, often, a little 
plain candy or sugar water acts as a restorative in cases 
of fatigue. If a stick of candy is occasionally given to 
the child after school, with coarse oatmeal crackers, so 
that he will not eat too rapidly, he is furnished with 
quick energy in an absolutely harmless form. But if 
candy is eaten just before a meal, the appetite is sated 
by the sweet, and the regular food may be refused. 

Stewed fruits, either dried or fresh, jellies and pre- 
serves, may be considered as sweets on account of the 
sugar they contain. A little thought shows that the too 
frequent supper of bread and butter, cookies, cake, pre- 
serves and tea, served so largely in country towns, is 
made up mostly of carbohydrates. Yet in many famil- 
ies it is served the year through. In most households 
the tendency is towards too much carbohydrate, which 
is liable to bring about auto-intoxication and obesity. Up 
to a certain point the body needs starch, but when an 
oversupply begins to be stored up as fat, the danger 
of obesity begins. 

FATS 

Fat is an important food constituent for it is the great- 
est source of latent or reserve energy, yet there is prob- 
ably no other item of the diet so generally disliked. 



14 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

From the time a child is old enough to be given meat he 
generally refuses even to taste the fat, and the mother, 
instead of coaxing him to eat, often cuts off the " offend- 
ing " morsel, little realizing that she is depriving her child 
of a great essential of his food. 

In the fat, or reserve force, group we find the fol- 
lowing foods : fat ham, pork, bacon, fat fish, sausages, 
cream, butter, oleomargarine, cream soups, rich cream 
cheese, olive-, corn- and peanut-oils, mayonnaise, and all 
salad dressings, almonds, peanuts and other nuts, rich 
gravies, ripe olives, hard or cream sauce, all kinds of 
rich pastry, suet puddings, fritters and all grease-cooked 
foods, chocolate, ice cream, mousses, Bavarian creams 
and parfaits. 

Fats must always be broken up or emulsified before 
they can be digested. The normal body is so. constituted 
that it does not crave large quantities at a time. So fats 
are generally served in combination olive oil being cut 
by lemon -juice or vinegar in a French dressing, butter 
spread on bread, eggs served with bacon, cream with 
shortcake and apple sauce with fat pork, Nature always 
calling for a balance. 

As fat is the last food constituent to be acted upon 
by the digestive organs, it may be readily seen why this 
becomes the reserve force element of the body. Any 
food cooked in it cannot be digested until Nature has 
broken up the fat cells. An omelet, fried eggs, fried 
steak, doughnuts, croquettes and the like are not easily 
available for the body's use until the fat has been acted 
upon. Pastry, cake and suet puddings rich in fat are 
equally slow of digestion, for the fat is so blended about 
the grains of flour and other ingredients that it must first 
be dissolved before they can be utilized. Foods cooked 
in fat remain in the digestive tract from one to two hours 
longer than is ordinarily necessary. This overtaxes the 
whole system, and, if such foods are eaten persistently, 
results in pallor, eruptions on the face, and a general air 
of lassitude. This does not mean that fried foods should 
be excluded from the diet, but that they should be served 
in moderation. 

In health all fats in reasonable amounts are digestible 
in the following order : good butter, cream, olive oil, pea- 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 15 

nut- and corn-oils, oleomargarine, beef fat, and the vari- 
ous pork products. 

In frying, fats are usually heated to the smoking point, 
when they break up and some of the products evolved 
are irritating to the intestinal canal. This is why burned 
butter is unwholesome, and why doughnuts and other 
foods fried in lard heated to the smoking-point are in- 
digestible. Animal fats smoke at a much lower temper- 
ature than do vegetable oils. For this reason the veg- 
etable product is a much better medium for frying. 
Olive oil is the best, prepared vegetable cooking oils come 
second, while lard and beef fat are the least desirable. 

In various experiments carried on to ascertain whether 
deep-fat frying or sauteing (frying in a small amount of 
fat) is preferable, the former method has proved to be 
the more economical, and the products more digestible, 
because approximately one-fourth less fat is absorbed 
into the foods. To be fried in deep fat, foods must con- 
tain enough egg instantly to coagulate them (as fritters), 
cfr else be coated with a thin layer of egg or dissolved 
gelatine (as croquettes). The surface is then instantly 
sealed, and the fat will not be absorbed to any great ex- 
tent. 

MINERAL, ACID AND BALLAST FOODS 

Mineral, acid and ballast foods are so closely connected 
that they really belong to the same group, and are sepa- 
rated only for convenience in planning the balanced 
ration. They include all bulky, watery vegetables, as 
onions, corn, cucumbers, carrots, cauliflower, celery, egg- 
plant, radishes, spinach, and all greens ; asparagus, string 
beans, salad plants, prunes, figs and rhubarb; all fresh 
fruits, coarse breads, cereals made from undenatured 
food products, as whole wheat meal, oatmeal, home 
ground cornmeal and brown rice. 

The term " minerals " is so little understood that the 
importance of this constituent in the diet is usually over- 
looked or left to take care of itself. The body averages 
seven pounds of mineral matter, five-sixths of which is 
found in the bones, the remainder being distributed 
throughout the tissues, where it performs important du- 
ties in assisting to oxidize, or burn, the food, carry off 



i.6 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

carbon dioxide (the by-product of oxidation) giving life 
to the nervous system and pliability to the muscles. In 
fact life cannot be carried on without mineral, and, just 
as there is crop failure if land lacks phosphorus or some 
other necessary constituent, the body droops, grows pale 
and finally ill, if deprived of any of these minerals. 
Lime, for instance, is essential to digestion, and, strangely 
enough, has a great affinity for sugar. In case many 
sweets are eaten and not enough lime, the body begins to 
call on its own store to combine with the sugar, gradually 
the lime is sapped from the teeth, and decay is apt to be- 
gin. Life itself cannot be carried on without iron, for 
the little red corpuscles of the blood cannot refresh, 
or reorganize, the body without it. When iron is defi- 
cient, pallor, lassitude and, finally, anemia may set in. 
The body cannot lack any one mineral and expect the 
others to carry on their work effectively. But if a bal- 
anced diet is used and the vegetables and fruits are care- 
fully prepared, the body will be supplied with all the 
mineral matter necessary. On such a diet little thought 
need be given to the matter of minerals and salt will be 
the only one which will have to be added. 

As all vegetables contain a variety of minerals, it is 
somewhat difficult to classify them as being rich in any 
particular one. 

Lime is found in all cereals and predominates in brown 
rice, as well as in radishes, apples and spinach ; while 
iron has a definite place in apples, lentils, strawberries, 
cabbage, spinach and string beans. 

It will be noticed that in classifying cereals the word 
" undenatured " is prefixed to wheat, oatmeal, cornmeal 
and brown rice. When a cereal is " denatured," one or 
more of its valuable elements have been removed. When 
wheat is made into white flour, a portion of the mineral 
is sacrificed. A similar loss is sustained when the heart 
and outer husks are removed from corn. Rolled oats 
and polished rice suffer in like manner. In this way 
the body is really deprived of several of the most im- 
portant food elements, and, if these special denatured 
foods predominate in the diet, mineral starvation results= 

Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the necessity of 
supplying minerals in the diet for prospective mother- 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 17 

hood. The body is then taxed to the utmost to supply 
not only itself, but the food essences needed for the new 
life. In this case, as with the child, the diet should be 
over-rich in minerals, as, otherwise, the bony structure 
of the coming baby will suffer, while the mother will be 
robbed of her own supply of body minerals to give to 
the child. The decay of the teeth of the pregnant mother 
is largely due to the lack of lime and phosphorus in the 
diet. 

Fruits, like vegetables, are both mineral and ballast 
foods. They also convey to the body various acids which 
are combined with minerals in such a way as to play an 
important part in maintaining health. As digestion 
transforms these acids into alkalis, they cause the blood 
to become alkaline and the urine less acid. The differ- 
ing flavors of fruits are due to these acids, in part, but 
more to the presence of small numbers of little bodies 
which almost elude investigation. While these are of 
no great nutritive value, they give the fruits pronounced 
flavor and make them valuable stimulants to the appetite 
and aids to digestion, because they excite the digestive 
juices. 

Fruits in their raw state have a much greater tonic- 
value, but as they are indigestible to many people, it is 
often necessary to cook them. Unless the liquor or 
medium in which they are prepared is served with them, 
they suffer great nutritive loss. The skins should be 
retained as far as possible, as many of the mineral salts 
are found just beneath the surface and are lost when the 
fruit is pared. Whether raw or cooked all fruits should 
be served with less sugar than is the usual custom. 
Fruit drinks offer an opportunity to introduce acids and 
salts into the system; any fruit, from peaches to grape- 
fruit, is adaptable, either alone or in combination. Again, 
these drinks should not be served too sweet, or the direct 
value is thwarted. Uncooked, acid fruits, however, 
should not be served in combination with starchy foods, 
as they frequently cause indigestion. Many a person 
has suffered for years from flatulence through eating 
both raw, acid fruit and cereal for breakfast. 

Figs, prunes and bananas should be classed as food 
fruits, rather than mineral fruits. Both figs and prunes 



18 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

contain so much sugar that they are listed under carbo- 
hydrates, although their mineral content is high. Both 
are ballast foods and very laxative. The banana is 
largely starch, so it also is classified under carbohydrates. 
As it is almost impossible in the north, to obtain bananas 
fully ripened, they should be served cooked, as other- 
wise, the starch is often indigestible. In any case the 
outer surface should be scraped off until the banana be- 
comes slippery. 

To manufacture foods that are 'concentrated, so 
that the body may acquire its nourishment without deal- 
ing with bulk, has been the subject of many experi- 
ments. But it has been proved that the body must have 
bulk in order to stimulate the digestive organs to suffi- 
cient activity, and to clear or " sweep out " the intestines. 

Most vegetables and fresh fruits contain so much cel- 
lulose that they are invaluable as ballast foods. Favor- 
ite refreshments a century ago were apples and nuts. 
This is a perfect combination, as the bulk of the apple 
satisfies the appetite and prevents the eating of too 
many nuts. If heeded, this simple rule of using bulk to 
supplement concentrated foods will do much towards 
producing better health. Bulky cereals, as whole-wheat 
meal, corn- and oatmeal, are splendid ballast foods, and, 
in cases of auto-intoxication or constipation, should be 
used to replace ordinary flour in making bread. All of 
the ballast foods should be used freely in either case. 

The dissolvent group includes several of the foods 
classed under minerals and bulk, as well as others which 
contain an abundance of liquid. Under this heading we 
find watery fruits and vegetables; gelatines, water-ices, 
frappes and sherbets; buttermilk, skimmed milk, fruit 
drinks, tea, coffee, water and stock and milk soups. 
About two-thirds of the body's weight is due to water. 
Approximately four and a half pints are given off each 
day in the waste and exhaustion, a portion of which is 
actually manufactured in the body tissues, the remainder 
coming from food and drink. Roughly speaking, in or- 
der to maintain the fluid balance for a day, at least two 
quarts of liquid should be taken by an adult, besides 
that contained in the food. In case the diet is over- 
heavy in meat and protein, more will be needed to carry 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 19 

off urea and other products of protein waste than when 
it is largely vegetarian or balanced. 

THE CALORIES AS A BASIS OF FOOD VALUES 

To the average housewife the modern literature on 
food, with its terms and calculations far removed from 
her experience and knowledge, reads so much like a text- 
book of mathematics, that at the mere mention of " calor- 
ies " she metaphorically " throws up her hands " and 
banishes all further thought of scientific cookery. As a 
matter of fact many of the discussions of food, which 
involve the question of calories and the resulting calcu- 
lations, are absolutely impracticable for ordinary use and 
overlook certain fundamental conceptions in the question 
of dietetics. For example, through the experience of 
years housewives have built up a series of food combina- 
tions which, when examined according to scientific 
standards, prove to be properly balanced in regard to 
the various foodstuffs and to have the approximate num- 
ber of calories to provide a sufficient diet. We find, for 
example, meat is served with potatoes almost universally, 
an approximate balance of foodstuffs, or rather a start 
towards that end. In other words the experience of the 
household has shown that certain combinations and cer- 
tain amounts of food keep the family in health and fur- 
nish the necessary material for repair of the body and 
for growth. What the scientists have been doing in the 
past generation has been to check up practice and place 
it upon a formal basis so that rules for diet might be 
formulated. 

Now to make it possible to eliminate guess-work from 
cookery and dietetics and enable us to figure out the 
whys and wherefores of the customs of the kitchen with 
absolute accuracy it was necessary to invent new terms. 
So it came about that " calorie " appeared. There is 
nothing especially complicated about this term and any 
housewife, in spite of her doubts and apprehensions, can 
easily acquire all the fundamental conceptions which it 
needs to add to her considerations in diet. " Calorie " is 
simply a term of measurement to show how much value 
a food has in the work the body has to do. The house- 
wife, through practice, is entirely familiar with a gas 



20 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

bill made out in terms of " feet " and probably with an 
electric light bill in terms of " kilowatts " ; also that the 
automobile is said to have so much " horse power." 
Few of us could give an accurate definition of these 
terms, but we accept them as the measure of our gas or 
of our electric light bill, or of the power of the car, 
without much thought or consideration. So a calorie 
is a similar unit of measure, only this time applied to our 
food. If a scientist is asked for the meaning of the 
term he will say that " it is the amount of heat which 
will raise the temperature of so much water so many 
degrees." He would, however, probably speak more pre- 
cisely and say the amount of heat which will raise a 
pound of water four degrees Fahrenheit, but all one 
needs to know to apply the knowledge " calorie " repre- 
sents to the household is that each food contains so many 
calories and we must have about so many of them in 
our daily diet. 

In short, calorie means heat and in this definition we 
see again that science is merely verifying an ancient 
tradition based on the knowledge gained from experi- 
ence. " Cool as a cucumber " is a phrase as old as the 
hills, but the new science of food values proves its ac- 
curacy. The cucumber is cool lacks heat for it 
takes a pound to supply seventy calories. Then we all 
know the nursery rhyme, " Pease porridge hot," and 
science shows that it is hot, for dried peas supply us with 
1655 calories per pound. And " pease porridge cold, 
pease porridge in the pot nine days old " is merely an- 
other way of saying that the heat units are all there after 
nine days. 

But these facts need in no way confuse us, for it is en- 
tirely unnecessary and impracticable to figure out exactly 
and absolutely the calorie content of each article of diet 
and the amount of total for the day. The most efficient 
results will be attained by fixing firmly in the mind the 
general proportions and general values of the different 
articles of food and checking up the family ration, 
roughly, from time to time. The principles of the bal- 
anced ration set forth in the preceding pages are, as a 
matter of fact, entirely sufficient for the introduction of 
scientific cookery into the household, but a notion of 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 21 

the caloric basis of " food values " is doubtless a help 
in understanding the problem most thoroughly. 

As we need so many feet of gas to run the oven in 
the gas stove for baking, so we need so many calories 
of food value to run our bodies each day. Perhaps it 
is easier to understand the application of the calorie if 
we consider that a large slice of bread, a large potato, 
an ordinary pat of butter, a shredded wheat biscuit, two 
ordinary graham crackers, or a small lamb chop each 
furnishes approximately one hundred calories in the 
daily ration. With these measures as a basis it is not 
so difficult to understand what is meant by saying that 
the average adult needs from 2500 to 3000 calories in 
the food of his daily ration. -We all know from experi- 
ence and observation that a woman neither requires nor 
eats as much food as a man and her requirements have 
been estimated at about two-thirds that of the man. An- 
other way of figuring is that the body needs so many 
calories for so much weight, and this brings the same 
result for a woman on the average obviously weighs 
less than a man. So children require less food than the 
adult and so on. The requirements for food which the 
scientists have laid down simply put into mathematical 
form the facts most of us have known and put more or 
less into practice. 

A rough estimate of food requirements is about as 
follows : 

A man without work 2450 calories 

A man doing moderate work 3000 calories 

A man doing hard work.... from 3400 to 5500 calories 

At first glance it may appear that there is not the ex- 
pected difference between the requirements of a man 
doing little work and one doing a great deal. But we 
must remember that the largest part of our food is used 
up in the unconscious activities of the body. Even when 
we are asleep the body is using up the energy derived 
from the food so that the unconscious demands require 
a considerable supply of food in themselves. Another 
vagary of the bodily mechanism is that brain work re- 
quires little or no energy from our food. This is why 
professional men should limit their food intake far 
below that of the day laborer. 



22 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Perhaps the matter of the amount of food required 
may be summed up by saying that the average man needs 
from three to four pounds of food a day this, of 
course, including bulky foods of a low caloric value 
proportioned according to the principles of the bal- 
anced ration. For it is not sufficient that the food total 
the 2000 or 3000 calories required ; they must be propor- 
tioned properly among proteins, fats and carbohydrates. 
Most of the dishes which appear on our tables combine 
the foodstuffs in some proportion or other. One has 
only to glance at a steak, for example, to realize that it 
must contain fat in addition to the protein which is its 
preponderating element. It is now believed that the 
food elements should appear in about the following pro- 
portions: i6f% protein, 25% fat, and the balance, or 
5^2 %j carbohydrates. In other words we should eat 
half as much again fat as protein and two and a half 
times as much carbohydrates as fat. The principal point 
of difference is about the protein, some authorities con- 
tending that eight per cent of protein in the diet is suffi- 
cient. 

But in estimating the demands for the three foodstuffs 
it should be remembered that all the food which we take 
in is not available, only about three-quarters of the pro- 
tein, for instance, being used in the body, so that a cer- 
tajn excess beyond the theoretical requirements is prob- 
ably desirable. 

From the foregoing we may estimate the daily food 
demands as follows : 

DAILY FOOD REQUIREMENTS 

Adult of Total Carbo- 

150 pounds calories Protein Fat hydrates 

At rest in bed 1800 300 450 1050 

Slight activity 2200 366 550 1284 

Light work 2600 433 650 151? 

Moderately hard work 3000 500 750 1750 

Very hard work 3400-5500 566-916850-1350 1984-3234 

Children require more food in proportion to their 
weight than adults. Their requirements are about as 
follows : 

Age o- 6 months 400- 800 calories 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AND COOKERY 23 

6-12 months 800 calories 

2 years 900 calories 

4 years 1200 calories 

8 years 1400 calories 

12 years 1600 calories 

The following table gives, roughly, the approximate 
constituents of the principal foods. In calculating food 

values it is necessary to know that an ounce of protein 

produces about 120 calories ; and an ounce of carbo- 
hydrates about the same, while an ounce of fat produces 
over twice as much, or approximately 260 calories.

26 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

But it is not sufficient that the diet contain the neces- 
sary number of calories, properly distributed among the 
proteins, carbohydrates and fats,, that there should be a 
sufficient bulk to insure the normal functioning of the 
bowels, and a proper amount of water and minerals, for 
scientists have discovered that certain mysterious sub- 
stances, vitamins, are also necessary and vital to health. 
What these substances are we do not know, but they ap- 
pear to be present in fresh foods, as meat, eggs, milk, 
and vegetables, and removed in the processes of manu- 
facture of many foods. It is necessary, therefore, that- 
fresh foods be included in the diet to provide these sub- 
stances; another argument in favor of the balanced 
ration. 



CHAPTER II 

THE DIET IN SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, AND 
WINTER 

If a family is fed a ration regulated according to the 
principles of balance, and deluged with the three other 
great foods sunlight, air, and water seasonal evils 
associated with foods will amount to little, and the fam- 
ily will be immune to many of the ills which arise when 
the principles of dietetics and hygiene are neglected. 
But in many families custom so largely regulates the 
menu according to wrong principles that spring fever 
and the like are very real conditions. 

The usual winter diet, for example, consists of greasy 
foods, such as sausages, fried bacon, roast pork and pork 
chops too many sweets, pie and rich cake with a 
scarcity of fruits and vegetables, and so is responsible 
for the ills associated with spring. The over-fed body 
rebels against the cloying diet, impoverished blood shows 
itself in anemia and blotched skin, pale cheeks are the 
guiding posts to tired stomachs, and the weary liver 
manifests itself in overpowering sleepiness. The old- 
time disease, " spring fever," tinges the beauty of the 
early spring days with melancholy sickness and ill- 
temper. 

A late March visit to a city school showed vividly the 
general tone of the system at this season, where proper 
dietetic principles had been neglected. The building was 
situated in a good locality, and the children were from 
well-to-do families. The pinched, wan faces, dull eyes, 
yellow skins of the pupils and the general atmosphere of 
lassitude which prevailed throughout the building was 
appalling. " I cannot do anything with them," said the 
discouraged teacher. " They will not respond ; they are 
either too tired or too lazy." " Spring fever," or, more 
scientifically, the ills of spring, had gripped the children 
in a relentless grasp and showed its insidious presence 

27 



28 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

in auto-intoxication, or the poisoning of the body through 
its own waste. 

These ills are mainly due to improper diet. In the 
spring the hearty winter foods must be forgotten, and 
replaced by lighter dishes, rather than by adding the lat- 
ter to meals already too heavy. A well known physician 
once remarked, " In treating disease diagnosis comes 
first, diet second, and medicine last." So the house- 
mother must learn not only how to get her family well, 
but how to prevent illness due to improper food. Un- 
fortunately the housewives who have attained this knowl- 
edge, or apply it to every-day living, are few and it 
takes the doctor with attendant medicines to bring the 
family into a normal state. His bill, by the way, goes 
into the family budget, an unnecessary item, blamed to 
the high cost of living! Such phrases as "biliousness," 
" gas in the stomach," " face broken out," " paleness," 
" anemia," " constipation," " touch of rheumatism," 
" colds," are conditions which are closely related to diet, 
as the house-mother who understands the importance of 
diet in disease is aware. 

If the body acquires the habit of eating over-hearty 
foods in winter, a change of diet, like the gradual transi- 
tion from winter to summer clothing, should be made 
slowly. This not only accustoms the body to a new 
regime, but possesses the added advantage of bringing 
about the change so insensibly that all danger of dis- 
agreeable comment from the family is obviated. It must 
always be borne in mind that, while a person is well and 
active, the same relative amount of food is needed by the 
body throughout the year, and that the difference be- 
tween winter and summer diet, for example, lies not in 
quantity, but in judicious substitution. 

Of all the digestive organs the liver is the busiest. It 
has been named the " clearing house of the body," for it 
is there that much of the cleansing of the blood is done 
and the body poisons or toxins are, so to speak, strained 
out, and the blood purified. Moreover, it is the great 
storehouse for sugar or " glycogen " and prepares other 
food stuffs for assimilation. Now the usual winter diet 
is excessively sweet and starchy hot breads, griddle 
cakes, quantities of potatoes, too much cocoa, macaroni, 



THE DIET 29 

rice, rich puddings, pies and cakes, cereals loaded with 
sugar, all of them good in their place, but, as a general 
rule, used indiscriminately. For instance, mince pie, a 
rich and hearty food, is the frequent dessert of a heavy 
dinner, whereas, to preserve the dietetic balance, it 
should be used to supplement a scanty meal. The ex- 
cess food causes the digestive organs to overwork 
(thereby breaking down), the liver is called upon to do 
extra work in storing up the sweets, and a headache 
frequently results. When it is understood that very 
heavy food, eaten out of place, tires the organs, it may 
easily be seen why too much starch or sweet finally 
clogs the liver, causing the secretion of bile to accumulate, 
and bringing about biliousness, auto-intoxication, and 
indigestion. 

" Gas in the stomach " usually indicates a tired condi- 
tion or a lack of pepsin in the gastric juice. A blotched 
face usually follows, whereas the latter condition often 
accompanies anemia. Constipation, of all ills, is per- 
haps the most prevalent. The word may be translated 
in two ways, either as a lack of bowel movement without 
cathartics, or in the sense that the intestinal movement 
goes on without carrying off the entire waste. Just as 
an iron pipe becomes filled with rust and the stream of 
water constantly decreases, the large intestine can be 
lined with waste that is never thoroughly cleared away. 
This is the usual type of spring constipation, and it car- 
ries with it extreme lassitude and intestinal indigestion, 
because the poisons which remain in the intestines are 
becoming re-absorbed, thereby enabling the body to poi- 
son itself. When an individual is in this condition, he 
becomes a prey to every passing breeze and change of 
temperature, often contracting a severe cold or the 
" grippe ! " 

All of these unwell conditions can be alleviated, and 
nearly always prevented, if the correct foods appear upon 
the spring table - not when the April sun shines hot 
upon the waking earth and the insidious poisons have 
begun to work, but by mid-March when the body first 
feels the change. Nature has provided for this exigency 
in the most satisfactory way, for along with the warm 
days come the spring foods, until, by early April, the 



30 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

markets are replete with the tempting greenery of the 
season. 

Ballast or bulky foods are those which should be used 
to replace the cathartics and physic of the medicine chest. 
Under this heading we find the fresh green vegetables, 
spinach, cowslips, dandelions being the most efficacious 
of them all. Spinach has been termed by the French 
" the broom of the stomach " because it is so bulky that 
it sweeps through the alimentary tract, stimulating the 
secretion of the juices, scraping the walls and carrying 
all waste away. Spinach once a day for a week or more 
will bring about immediate results. It will soon pall 
upon the appetite, if it is always served in the same way, 
but any housewife with imagination (wherein lies the 
secret of good cookery) can make it into so many seduc- 
tive dishes, that a complaint will not be heard. As plain 
" greens/' creamed, poured upon toast, and surmounted 
with poached eggs, scuffled, in salad (either combined 
with other vegetables or with eggs), boiled with ham, 
or scalloped with salt fish it can be used for any meal 
in the day. It is a great mistake to consider foods suit- 
able only for certain occasions, for all foods are so 
adaptable that they can be prepared in diverse ways for 
breakfast, luncheon or dinner, and whereas, for example, 
the family may refuse spinach for dinner, they will wel- 
come it for breakfast because it is a novelty! 

This same group of ballast foods includes lettuce, ro- 
maine and watercress all known as salad plants. 
Watercress has been used since great antiquity as a 
spring salad and tonic, for the old Greek had, in a way, 
a greater faith in diet than we have to-day. 

All of these greens contain the mineral craved by the 
worn-out tissues. Iron, potassium, calcium, sulphur, 
phosphorus, all these and many more are contained in 
all growing things. It is due to Nature's wonderful 
alchemy that so many minerals can be eaten at once, for 
were a like amount to be taken in the form of medicine, 
severe illness and, sometimes, death would follow. 
Spinach is the richest in iron of any vegetable, carrots 
follow, while dandelions, beets, salad plants and all veg- 
eatables contain certain amounts. Watercress furnishes 
sulphur, whereas cauliflower, onions and cabbage are 



THE DIET 31 

rich not only in sulphur, but phosphorus. Butter is usu- 
ally adopted as a seasoning for vegetables, but, when- 
ever possible, olive oil should be substituted. 

There is no more refreshing way to serve vegetables 
than in a salad, and in the springtime, when the body 
needs natural tonics, no other dressing should be used 
than olive oil and lemon juice. Use three tablespoon- 
fuls of oil and a tablespoonful of lemon juice, well- 
mixed, and add a dash of salt and pepper. This will 
dress salad for six people. Olive oil, however, may be 
rather prohibitive because of its high cost. If it is im- 
possible to afford it, peanut oil may be substituted. 

A green salad may replace the main course at a lunch- 
eon, if cheese, eggs, or nuts are combined with it. Cream 
cheese, for instance, can be put through the potato ricer 
and sprinkled over it cream cheese may be served with 
any green salad. Sliced hard-cooked eggs may accom- 
pany cress or cooked spinach, and nuts are delicious 
with any cabbage or celery combination. In such cases 
the meal should commence with a simple soup, and a 
good way to introduce an excess of mineral into the 
spring diet is to prepare a cream of lettuce, cress, or spin- 
ach soup. These may have as a foundation any clear 
soup stock the vegetable, together with rice, should b,e 
simmered in it, hot milk added when they are soft, and 
the whole strained and thickened with egg. Such a soup 
is a perfect adjunct to a luncheon. Entire-wheat-meal 
bread or rolls should accompany the salad,* and the des- 
sert may consist of an egg and milk pudding with a 
simple cookie or cake. 

But Nature's tonics include not only vegetables but 
fruits as well. The citrous group, including the grape- 
fruit, orange and lemon, are wholesome and palatable. 
As a general rule the lemon is used in beverages in 
this case it should be very tart or, better still, be left 
unsweetened. A baked lemon is not unpalatable, and 
may be eaten with a spoon, and lemon juice may be used 
in any case as a substitute for vinegar. In lemon jellies, 
in salad dressings, poured over other fruits, served in 
black coffee, in pineapple puddings, and in other ways, 
lemon juice may be served to the family. 

Rhubarb, while it is really a vegetable, is served as a 



32 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

fruit in so many ways that it need never become a mo- 
notony. As a gelatine, baked with raisins, stewed, 
cooked in cubes, and dressed with oil and lemon juice, 
or in the form of dumplings or shortcake, it is delicious. 

Pineapple appears the first of May and its juice is a 
splendid tonic. About the second week in May straw- 
berry season is at its height. Of all the world-spanning 
fruits it is the foremost, carrying with it refreshed 
vitality and a satisfied appetite. 

All of these spring fruits and vegetables should be sup- 
plemented by at least two quarts of water daily to aid 
the kidneys in eliminating waste, and by the use of whole 
wheat meal bread made of unrobbed wheat to stimu- 
late the action of the intestines. 

THE SUMMER DIET 

The sultry nights, scorching noons and long, languorous 
days of mid-summer produce a relaxed condition in the 
whole body and this torpor must be overcome before 
food can be digested. The fundamental principle under- 
lying the summer diet is the toning up of the digestive 
organs to the point where they will respond quickly to 
food. There is no better stimulant than a hot soup or 
Bouillon, served without cream. Either will whip the 
cells of the stomach into action, stimulate the gastric 
juices and pave the way for assimilation of solid food. 
One means of cooling the body is through evaporation. 
When perspiration is profuse, evaporation is increased, 
and when a cup of hot, clear soup is served, it not only 
starts the gastric juices, but induces perspiration. If 
preceded by the soup, a salad, punch or ice will not pro- 
voke disturbance, because the stomach juices are already 
at work and the languid condition has been overcome. 

Ice cream and iced drinks are gastronomically pleas- 
ing, no doubt, and during the actual moment of eating 
produce a passing sensation of coolness. However in 
reality there is no type of food more heating, because the 
stomach is chilled and digestion is consequently retarded ; 
the sudden cold checks the flow of perspiration, causing 
waste products, ordinarily expelled through the pores, to 
be retained, and metabolism, or the burning of the tis- 
sues, is thereby increased, because the body machinery 



THE DIET 33 

is clogged. Besides all this, most ices and cold drinks 
are dependent upon ice cream, chocolate, or cream in 
varying degrees as a basis, and are highly sweetened to 
suit the popular taste. Cream and chocolate are not 
heating foods, but sugar in any form is a heat producer, 
so, in addition to the clogging of the system, most so- 
called cooling creams and drinks become heating agents, 
because of their constituents. The increase of heat does 
not mean that the temperature of the body rises above 
normal, but simply that the sensation of heat becomes 
more pronounced. In rare cases, however, the sudden 
chill, or the accession of an over-abundance of heating 
food, will produce a severe attack of indigestion, with 
a consequent rise of temperature. 

Meat is heating because it contains certain stimulating 
juices is a quick fuel and during assimilation causes 
a greater breaking down of tissue than any other food. 
A meat substitute contains all the elements of meat, with- 
out being stimulating and heating. Under this heading 
may be mentioned eggs, nuts, cheese, fish and milk, or 
combinations of foodstuffs such as macaroni with cheese 
sauce, or potato and nut salad with oil dressing. In or- 
der to be efficacious any substitute dish must contain 
both protein and fats, which are the principal constituents 
of meat. For instance, a salad of cottage cheese 
(which is made of skimmed milk) must be supplemented 
with an olive oil dressing in order to be a satisfactory 
meat substitute. The average active family should have 
a small amount of meat once a day, because the system 
craves variety. The most acceptable meats for summer 
use appear in lighter form, as boiled ham or tongue, 
chicken in various ways, chops, veal, or pressed corned 
beef and meat loaves. The balance of the meal should 
consist largely of fresh vegetables with bread, butter 
and a sweet. 

Every meal, in addition to meat, or meat substitute, 
should be enlivened by green and fresh vegetables. For 
convenience green vegetables may be termed those which 
are served raw including lettuce, cress, escarole, ro- 
maine, celery, new dandelions and radishes, while under 
the head of fresh vegetables may be grouped all the 
remaining products of the garden. Green vegetables 



34 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

should be served raw, as salads not the usual mayon- 
naise-drenched, nut-sprinkled salad of the American 
home, but the deliciously seasoned, oil-absorbed dish of 
the French. It is an easy matter to buy a prepared 
dressing at the groceries to pour it over a dish of wet 
leaves and call it a salad. It is another matter to pre- 
pare it so that the family longs for it. The reason that 
Mary will not eat lettuce, or John romaine, is not usually 
because of the food, but of the faulty preparation. Any 
green salad must be carefully dried, the French dress- 
ing poured over it, and then mixed, or " fatigued " as the 
French say, until it is so thoroughly mixed that the leaves 
look wilted. Then only will the salad fulfil its mission. 
Fresh greens dressed in this way are usually suitable for 
breakfast, luncheon or dinner, while a salad of mixed 
vegetables, of fish, eggs, potatoes, or meat should be 
served only as the main dish at luncheon or dinner. A 
mayonnaise or a heavy cream dressing has no place 
with the salad of an otherwise heavy meal. There is 
no better summer food than olive oil but it must be 
used as a part of, rather than as an addition to, a meal, 
as otherwise the excess fat will upset digestion. Fresh 
vegetables should be stewed in as little water as possible, 
so that the liquid may serve as sauce, and be seasoned as 
needed, with salt, pepper and olive oil, or butter. 

During the winter season hot breads have a certain 
place in the diet, but in summertime they should be fore- 
gone as they are liable to cause auto-intoxication. When 
they are used, they should be of a lighter variety, as 
baking powder biscuits, or whole wheat gems. There 
is, however, no better time for the introduction of de- 
licious yeast breads than during this time of automobile 
luncheons and picnics, and occasionally rasin and nut 
bread, a loaf of graham or rye, or old-fashioned Johnny- 
cake will often retrieve an otherwise scanty meal. 

For the summer dessert there is no food so suitable 
as fruit, and, if rightly prepared and served in a variety 
of ways, it will never become tiresome. When the day 
is exceptionally warm, a fruit ice has a place in the 
menu because it introduces both water and fruit juice. 
When an ice cream is to be served, it should be used in 
a menu scanty in fat, as otherwise it will be overheating. 



THE DIET 35 

If iced drinks must be used, let them be of acid qual- 
ity, as lemonade, orangeade, pineapple punch, or rasp- 
berryade, rather than heavy iced-coffee or chocolate. 
Ginger ale is a good summer drink because it is so pep- 
pery that it acts as a stimulant although too much, 
like an overabundance of spice, will cause the stomach 
muscles to become so relaxed that they refuse to respond 
except to stimulus. 

In planning the summer diet, the housekeeper must 
lay aside all tradition of the particular foods suitable 
for each meal, and when asparagus is in season, for in- 
stance, serve it creamed for breakfast, or introduce let- 
tuce as a breakfast salad, while poached eggs for lunch, 
or macaroni and cheese at dinner may prove acceptable. 
In other words the summer diet must not be stereotyped 
rather it should be so lenient that the foods may con- 
form to the weather, and the housewife should be con- 
versant with food values in order to plan the meals ac- 
cording to rough dietetic standards. 

Meat is by no means the most expensive item in the 
living budget, and the housewife living on a limited in- 
come will find it difficult to plan summer meals within 
her allowance when the bills for green stuffs and fruits 
are high. However, menus can be planned to suit every 
pocketbook, and, while it may not be possible to purchase 
fresh fruits and vegetables when they first appear, they 
soon drop to a normal figure. A young wife who was 
living for the first time in a city flat displayed with pride 
her garden ! She was fortunate enough to possess a 
back porch, about eight feet square; the ingenious hus- 
band had constructed two shelves on the porch floor and 
on each of the shelves were placed boxes of earth in 
which cress, lettuce and radishes were growing. " I 
simply had to have salad," remarked the girl, " and as we 
can't afford to buy it we've grown it here and it's such 
fun," she added. 

A woman who is really interested will contrive to 
feed her family on the right food under all circumstances. 

THE FALL AND WINTER DIET 

Diet in the winter differs from that of any other sea- 
son. It is a time of brisk winds, snow and ice, and the 



36 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

colder the weather the greater oxidation there is in the 
body. The fact that food is to the body as coal to the 
furnace means no more to the majority of educated 
housewives than the falling of a rain drop, for the truth 
that food makes warmth and heat, activity in little bodies, 
and the energy of great minds does not seem real. 

People who exist in warm rooms and live at low rates 
of speed can eat hot-house foods in a hot-house at- 
mosphere, but those who really revel in the cold weather 
are buoyed up by a wholesome winter diet to all vicissi- 
tudes of wind and storm. Those who keep warm when 
the thermometer hovers near zero are not necessarily 
swathed in heavy flannels, muffled with scarfs and bur- 
dened with furs they may be those whose rosy cheeks, 
bright eyes and springing step denote correct feeding 
and adequate digestion. Right feeding in winter does 
not concern itself with quantity but rather with furnish- 
ing a sufficient amount of nourishment with a minimum 
of waste. The individual who eats too much cannot util- 
ize the surplus, and it must be passed off, partly digested, 
as waste from the skin, kidneys and bowels. This over- 
exerts the waste channel and much of the energy gained 
from the food is used in eliminating waste. The vitality 
is thereby lowered and the individual becomes " run- 
down " and is subject to colds, grippe, and indigestion. 
More complete digestion and less waste is the efficient 
fundamental of the winter diet. 

Fuel foods are meats, starches, sweets and fats. Meat 
makes muscle, enriches the blood and furnishes heat, and, 
for most of us, it is a necessity in the winter diet. 

Starches and sweets are fuel or activity foods, their 
mission being to create quick energy. When a sudden 
heat is desired, the housewife adds a little kindling to 
the dying fire. Where the vitality is lowered a cup of 
cocoa, or a little rice with melted jelly, will restore en- 
ergy, because it adds kindling to the body flame. But, 
like the fire of light wood, it is soon consumed, and the 
inertia again appears. Starch is to the diet as kindling 
to the fire; it produces a quick heat, then burns itself 
out. Prodding the body to greater activity on a diet 
of starch is as criminal as beating a horse that is old and 
weak, yet it is a common practice in many homes !

THE DIET 37 

Besides meat to make muscle and energy, starch to 
furnish quick energy, and fat to afford reserve force, 
the body needs, in winter as in summer, the eliminating 
qualities of fresh fruits, and uncanned or fresh veg- 
etables to cleanse the blood and keep the waste channels 
awake and active. In England the cranberry is more 
generally used and appreciated for this purpose than is 
the case in this country. In northern countries the cran- 
berry is gathered as a precious winter food, dried on 
long strings, and used as an antidote to the overmuch fat 
demanded by the rigorous winter. Like the greens of 
the spring diet the cranberry, through its citric acid and 
iron, has a definite and neglected place in the winter 
menu. 

Oranges, lemons and grapefruit may also be added to 
the list of the winter's tonic fruits, any one containing 
a well defined amount of citric acid. Whenever they can 
be obtained, grapes are an unequaled winter fruit, bring- 
ing tartrates of soda, potash, phosphoric acid, lime, 
magnesia and iron to the body in such form as to be al- 
most immediately assimilated into the blood. It is need- 
less to state that when canned, made into jelly or mar- 
malade, grapes, like all the preserved fruits, lose their 
efficiency as tonic fruits and become sweets-. 

As in the diet for the rest of the year, the fresh veg- 
etable has a definite place in the winter menu. The term 
signifies not only green vegetables, but all that are not 
canned, as beets, carrots, turnips, parsnips, oyster-plant, 
onions and cabbage. None of these lose their salts and 
acids when taken from the ground, although the water is 
somewhat evaporated, causing a withered appearance. 
Of the green vegetables peculiar to the winter season, 
celery is generally available. As it contains a generous 
proportion of salts or minerals it is peculiarly valuable 
as a blood food. Watercress may be found under the ice 
in all northern brooks a bountiful provision of Nature 
to supply phosphorous and sulphur in sufficient quanti- 
ties. Lettuce, endive and parsley can be obtained 
throughout the year in city markets and are valuable as- 
sets to the winter menu. In the country stores they can- 
not be secured, but there is no reason why any housewife 
with a scrap of land at her disposal cannot raise them in 



38 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

hot beds. In case this is not feasible they may be grown 
in window boxes. 

As lettuce or endive do not need much sun or demand 
much heat, it is always possible to find a suitable window 
for them. Parsley, to be of rich green, needs sunlight. 
An attractive way to grow it is to obtain a wooden paint 
bucket, bore half inch holes in the sides, fill the bucket 
with rich earth, and plant the seeds in the holes. When 
hung in a sunny kitchen window the seeds will germi- 
nate in about two weeks the final result being not only 
a delightful seasoning for the winter foods, but a real 
ornament to the room. 

Mince pie, sausages, griddle cakes, roast pork, oatmeal, 
doughnuts, pork and beans and suet puddings, all have 
a certain niche in the winter menu but they must be used 
in proper combination. Sausage is a fuel food, for ex- 
ample, and should not be used in a menu otherwise re- 
plete with fat. To illustrate, a luncheon of sausage, 
fried potatoes, bread and butter, and suet pudding would 
give indigestion as all contain a large amount of fat. 
When used properly, sausages should appear in a menu, 
which would eliminate the large amount of the fat, as 
mashed potatoes and another vegetable, and a plain 
dessert. 

If possible, the winter meal should be commenced with 
something hot, as a cup of soup, or a little hot, spiced 
grape juice, because they stimulate the digestive juices 
to greater activity. It must be remembered, however, 
that it is necessary to work in an extra amount of fuel 
food to overcome the wearing away of the tissues 
through oxidation, yet this must be done in such a way 
that nausea will not be produced. A meal consisting of 
starch and sugar is sure to bring, sooner or later, a sick 
headache in its wake. -Any woman who is guilty of 
serving the typical New England supper of white bread, 
an economical supply of butter, cake, cookies, preserves 
and tea, has only to remember the frequent early morn- 
ing headaches in her family to prove this statement. 
Both sugar and fats must be introduced generously into 
certain of the foods, the remainder of the menu consisting 
of other elements. Cabbage will take up one-third of its 
weight in fats, mashed potatoes one-half, baked potatoes 



THE DIET 39 

three-fifths, and peas one-fourth. When the family 
seems to lack energy, add extra olive oil or butter to the 
vegetables, then turn back and add some more! If the 
family seems tired, a quick energy food is probably 
needed, but do not urge more food, prepare cocoa or 
apple sauce, or some other food, making it sweeter than 
usual, and do not demur when son " loads " his cereal 
with sugar. He needs it or he would not do it. Let the 
children make taffy Sunday afternoons, they crave the 
sugar, but keep careful watch lest the inborn tendency 
toward a " sweet tooth " is not abnormally developed. 



CHAPTER III 
THE CHILDREN'S MEALS 

There is no part of household economy so generally 
neglected as the children's meals, particularly from the 
time when liquid diet is supplanted by solid food up to 
the beginning of school days. When a seedling is first 
set in the earth, it is carefully shielded from the hot rays 
of the sun and watered regularly till the roots are well 
grounded. Then the shield is removed and gradually 
the plant grows, until, with proper care, it reaches per- 
fection. The way of children is the same ; when the 
little one is weaned and taught to eat solid food up 
to maturity his diet needs supervision ; but the first six 
years, great formative period of health, are the most 
critical of all, for just as the plant wilts in the hot sun 
and shrivels, from lack of water, so may the little child 
fade if the correct diet is not provided. 

As children grow irregularly they demand, at different 
periods, various kinds of food for building purposes 
yet at all times enough of each element must be provided 
to insure the even growth of all parts of the body. Up 
to the age of eighteen months, the child has eaten little 
except milk, bits of stale bread, some hard crackers, a 
morsel of rice, a little beef juice, or, occasionally, part 
of an egg and some orange juice. He has not been par- 
ticularly active and, therefore, has demanded little 
starch, the milk-sugar, with starch from bread, sufficing 
to meet his need, as he is occupied with the business of 
growing. He now commences to be more active, both 
bodily and mentally, and needs more starch, or activity- 
making food, to replace the energy he so freely gives off. 
This is best supplied in the form of cereal or bread. 
At the same time the pliable little bones are withstand- 
ing great weight in proportion to their strength and need 
foods that make them firm and we/11-formed. Minerals 
are the elements needed and, for the convenience of the 

40 



THE CHILDREN'S MEALS 41 

mother and the digestion of the child, they may be pro- 
vided under the great head, cereals. Not the ordinary, 
steam-cooked, predigested article of commerce, but the 
well-prepared, old-fashioned, undenatured cereal. Mush, 
made from the whole corn, heart and all, brown rice, not 
polished with talc, oatmeal, whole wheat mush, made 
from the entire grain these are the cereals that make 
blood and bone, brain and brawn, because they contain 
all the wholesomeness of Mother Earth. They include 
more than minerals for bone and starch for energy ; they 
include, as analysis shows, a goodly percentage of protein 
for tissue building. But in themselves they are not a 
perfect food for they lack fat, the great element which 
gives to the body reserve force, needed in stress of dis- 
ease that is why they are always combined with good 
milk or light cream. As they are rich in starch they 
should not be served with sugar, since that gives to the 
body too much carbohydrate. 

Up to the time the child is six months old, Nature has 
not provided a specific digestive juice to act upon any 
carbohydrate other than milk-sugar. Why, then, when 
a. child begins to run about, should his system be sated 
with sweets when it is not necessary to growth? Babies 
of two years and less cry for candy, children, not old 
enough to differentiate in flavors, demand sugar on their 
cereal ; this is abnormal, the latent sugars in fruits, 
breads, healthful crackers and cookies being sufficient 
for the need. A child will not know what candy is un- 
less taught, and if adoring relatives are instructed that 
no sweets or other foods are to be given, other than those 
in his dietary, he will always be ready for his meals and 
can digest them properly. 

As he can eat but a small amount at a time, he should 
be fed often, needing five feedings a day, from eighteen 
months up to two years and a half, and four from two 
and a half up to three and a half years. He is then ready 
to go on a three-meal ration, though, if he shows a 
tendency to be hungry between times, it is far better 
to establish a regular period for the luncheon than to 
allow promiscuous nibbling. 

The ideal way to feed children is away from the family 
table, a suitable meal being provided for them. A low 



42 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

nursery table and chairs of kindergarten height are often 
used for this purpose, lending a note of comfort and 
" grown-up " air to meal-time that always has a good 
effect. In the average American home where little help 
is kept this is not usually practicable as it entails extra 
work for the mother. It may be adopted, however, at 
supper-time in order to observe an early bed hour. 

As children always want exactly what grown-ups have, 
it is difficult to feed them a strict ration, unless the elders 
of the family are willing to sacrifice so that the children 
will not see rich and tempting foods. The mother must 
also be clever enough to know the value of substitution. 
Every small boy will tease for coffee, " just like daddy," 
and it will often be given him before he is three, the 
mother never realizing that she is fostering nervousness 
and a necessity for artificial stimulation. The child 
should not be allowed to taste tea or coffee, being given, 
instead, a cup " like father's," full of " cambric tea," or 
brown bread coffee slightly sweetened, and, knowing no 
difference, he will be contented and happy. Make the 
child's food look as much like the family's as possible. 

He should not be asked what he wants to eat, as his 
taste is undeveloped and he always wants an impossibil- 
ity. He should be taught to eat anything placed before 
him, provided care is taken not to serve too much, or he 
will overeat. From the first he should be trained to 
chew his food well, or he will eat too fast; moreover, 
children should not be left alone at meals, for the same 
reason. A grown person should always be at hand to 
watch and to carry on conversation, thus interrupting the 
business of eating with frequent rests. Another reason 
children eat too fast is because food is too fully pre- 
pared, nothing being left for them to do but eat it. When 
a child is old enough to sit at the table, he is old enough 
to be taught good manners and self-help. 

As it is one of the great essentials of the diet, water 
should be given from birth, but as the child is liable to 
use it to " wash down " food, it is not a wise plan to 
serve it at meals. Better give him a drink the first thing 
in the morning, also in the mid-morning and afternoon, 
and an hour after every meal. If he asks for more, he 
should be given as much as he craves. 



THE CHILDREN'S MEALS 43 

In giving children liquids at meal-time, it should be 
borne in mind that most of them are foods and should 
be treated as such in the dietary. Milk, for instance, is 
a protein food and, if it accompanies a meal, the amount 
of meat or eggs served should be cut down proportion- 
ately, as, otherwise, the meal will not balance. When 
cocoa is provided, it should be considered both a starch 
(from the cocoa) and a protein (from the milk) and 
therefore treated as a factor in the meal. It is a heavy 
food and, taken in excess, sometimes clogs the kidneys. 
Therefore, it is not a wise breakfast drink, being better 
suited to an occasional mid-afternoon lunch or supper. 

From the first, Nature provides for the child a' bal- 
anced ration. Later, it behooves the mother to plan food 
as nearly balanced as she gives the older members of the 
family. Whereas it is true that the child has little taste 
developed, he often rebels at monotony. Often, the 
necessary, every-day foods may be provided in a new 
guise, soft gingerbread cookies, in animal shapes, bread 
as a " bread man " and " eggs in a nest," instead of 
boiled, are all good examples of the way the same food 
may be served in different ways. The basis of every 
meal for the child should be a protein, a starch, or two, 
a fat, and minerals. It is best to limit the portions ac- 
cording to the age of the child. From a year and a half 
to two years and a half the day's menus may be planned 
as follows : 

7 A. M. Fresh milk, half a cup ; the yolk of a slightly 
boiled egg, one or two thin slices of entire wheat bread 
and butter. 

ii A.M. A scant half cup of milk and a graham 
cracker. 

2 P. M. One cupful of chicken, beef, or mutton broth, 
one thin slice of toast and a little well-boiled brown rice 
with milk. 

5. P. M. One or two thin slices of toast, moistened with 
hot milk. 

This menu may be changed from day to day, two 
tablespoonfuls of well-cooked cereal with an additional 
half cup of milk being substituted for the egg in the 
morning. The juice of half an orange and a thin slice of 
bread and butter for the eleven o'clock lunch, a table- 



44 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

spoonful of rare, broiled scraped beef, or a small, well- 
baked potato and a saucer of junket for the broth at 
noon, while two tablespoonfuls of cereal and rich milk 
could be used at night. If the child is inclined to be 
constipated, a tablespoonful of steamed prunes, or figs, 
unsweetened, may be sifted and fed at one meal of the 
day. This, with a little orange juice, and the persistent 
use of entire-wheat-meal bread will usually overcome 
any such tendencies. 

From two and a half up to three years the diet may 
be gradually increased; the succeeding menus show how 
this change may be affected. 

7 A. M. A small cup of milk, a poached egg on buttered 
toast and a small quantity of sifted cooked prunes, figs 
or apple sauce. 

ii A. M. A cupful of beef, chicken, or mutton broth 
with a whole wheat cracker. 

2 P. M. A small slice of rare roast beef or mutton (a 
heaping tablespoonful cut up), a small baked potato, 
mashed and served with cream or dish gravy, a thin 
slice of bread, a small saucer of cereal pudding. 

5:30 P.M. Whole wheat crackers and milk and soft 
ginger cookies. 

For breakfast an undenatured cereal with cream may 
replace the egg, for variety. In case this is done, the egg 
may be used at supper. The eleven o'clock lunch should 
not be eaten unless the child is really hungry. At noon 
a little finely divided steak, chop, chicken, or turkey 
may be used instead of the beef, but no game, pork, veal, 
or fried meats should be allowed. 

From three and a half years up to six the diet may 
be increased; from then on he will assume the general 
family diet. It will be unnecessary to watch quantities 
closely, as, if normal, the child's appetite is a fair guide 
and he will not overeat if taught to masticate each mouth- 
ful thoroughly. The following menus show a variety of 
correct combinations. 

Breakfast 

Cereal with light cream; entire wheat bread and but- 
ter; a choice of eggs lightly boiled, poached or scrambled, 
varied occasionally by a little well-boiled ham or baked 



THE CHILDREN'S MEALS 45 

bacon or a few creamed oysters or oyster stew. Fresh 
fruit should never be eaten at breakfast, as the acid is 
liable to combine with the starch of the cereal causing 
gas to form. Hqwever, it may be used as a mid-morn- 
ing luncheon, ripe peaches, pears and cantaloupes, seeded 
grapes and oranges being suitable ; bananas should never 
be used unless baked. 

Dinner 

A half cup of clear soup, broth, or bouillon, beef, tur- 
key, chicken or mutton, roasted or broiled, or a small 
quantity of broiled fish; entire- wheat-meal bread and but- 
ter, a choice of baked potatoes, boiled brown rice or but- 
tered spaghetti, and one of the following vegetables: 
stewed celery, stewed spinach, fresh peas, fresh string 
beans, lettuce, or any salad green or fresh celery. For 
dessert, fruit, gelatine, junkets, cereal puddings, baked 
custards or plain cream or water ices are permissible. 

Supper 

Supper varies greatly with the season of the year. In 
winter nothing is more welcome than a simple milk soup, 
with buttered entire-wheat-meal toast, fresh or stewed 
fruit, and a slice of sponge cake a day old, or a soft gin- 
ger or sugar cookie. If eggs are not used at breakfast 
time, they may appear at supper, while a dish of wheat 
cereal and a glass of milk or cocoa and a baked apple 
may often be sufficient. In the summertime great care 
should be taken not to feed the child heating food at 
night, therefore, the best supper is really fresh milk with 
stale bread or crackers and a soft cookie. In case the 
child seems to need more nourishment, a well-beaten egg 
may be added to the milk and served as an egg-nog, while 
cereal (preferably undenatured), cooked with dates or 
figs, may be moulded and served cold with a little sugar 
or light cream. It should be remembered that when 
cereals are served at supper the same rule applies as at 
breakfast fresh fruit should not accompany them. 
The usual stewed fruit may be varied in many ways, 
fruit whips, boiled apples, lightly spiced prunes, dates 
flavored with orange juice and steamed figs, offering a 



46 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

change. Often, a supper otherwise deficient in protein 
may be balanced by the addition of a baked custard con- 
taining eggs. It must be kept in mind that none of these 
meals will balance unless whole-wheat-meal bread and 
undenatured cereals are always used to supply the neces- 
sary mineral. They also accomplish another great mis- 
sion, that of regulating the bowels through bulk. 

In case the child refuses to eat, do not force him 
against his will, but examine his mouth, which may be 
sore from cutting teeth, and make sure that his digestive 
organs and bowels are active. Again, the food may not 
be well-cooked and flavored, as the majority of cooks 
think that anything will do for a child. If he is simply 
irritable and cross, take the food away and do not offer 
it again until the next meal. 

SCHOOL LUNCHEONS 

Mothers are beginning to realize that the school lunch- 
eon must consist of something more substantial than 
white bread sandwiches made with jam, jellies, or fruit 
butters, a slice of cake and a piece of pie. These are all 
foods that, rightly used, may have a definite place in the 
diet, but they must appear in suitable combination or else 
the child will practically be " starving in the midst of 
plenty," i.e. be suffering the bad effects of malnutrition, 
because of a diet over-filled with starch and sweet, and 
lacking in the elements that give stamina and promote 
muscular development. 

There is a widespread notion that the balancing of the 
daily ration can be stretched over the three meals with- 
out regard to actual combinations in each menu: that a 
lunch consisting of a too large proportion of starch and 
scarcity of other foods can be reckoned in at the close 
of the day as having furnished a generous share of the 
starch needed for the twenty-four hours, the other meals 
being made deficient in starch to keep up the general 
balance. Theoretically, this may be true, but practically, 
it does not work out well, because the body is being con- 
stantly torn down, or laid waste, and needs the actual 
replenishment of all food elements three times a day. 
This does not necessarily mean that large quantities of 
food must be consumed at each meal, but rather that 



THE CHILDREN'S MEALS 47 

smaller portions of each element needed for replenish- 
ment should be provided. As a general rule this is not 
true with the school luncheon, whether carried by the 
child or furnished by the school at small cost. When the 
luncheon is carried, this condition is entirely under the 
mother's control, but, when it is provided at the school, 
it should be controlled by someone who* knows dietetic 
values and who can provide a well-balanced meal. 

The receptacle in which the luncheon is carried has a 
great influence on the food. A papier mache, or leather, 
box, for instance, absorbs odors and at the same time im- 
parts this accumulation to fresh foods that are packed 
in it. The most satisfactory utensil is a tin or granite- 
ware pail, or box, that can be scalded and sunned each 
day; or a wicker basket that can be washed and aired. 
Most school luncheons, in comparison to regular meals, 
contain very little nourishment, and mothers frequently 
say that the children will not eat what is provided, lay- 
ing the responsibility to small appetites. In only too 
many cases the decrq&sing desire to eat is due to dis- 
agreeable food flavors. 

It is impossible to lay down hard and fast menus for 
all children, as they differ in their likes and dislikes. 
Girls, for instance, enjoy carrying little jars of creamed 
meat, or stewed fruit, which necessitates a spoon and 
they really anticipate the noon hour with its possibilities 
for " make believe " housekeeping. On the other hand, 
the average boy says he doesn't " want any frills " and 
begs for a compact lunch that can be eaten quickly. Un- 
fortunately this is one of the worst features of the 
school luncheon, for too rapid eating causes indigestion 
and the consequent mental heaviness which is the bane 
of school teachers. This can be overcome in a measure 
by the mother who need not prepare the luncheon too 
completely hard-cooked eggs, for instance, should be 
left in the shell, crusts left on the bread and whole fruits 
provided, so that it will take the boy a few minutes to 
get his food ready to eat. For this same reason, nuts in 
the shell should be provided; they cannot be eaten too 
quickly and their rich protein is worth working to get. 

The general directions for planning the school lunch- 
eon should be the same as those for any other meal. 



48 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

There should be a meat or its equivalent, enough starch 
to correspond to the bread and potatoes eaten at most 
meals, something bulky to fill up the chinks, one sweet 
and a refreshing food, as fruit. The obvious food for 
the main part of the lunch is the sandwich, which may be 
varied by different types of bread as well as fillings. 
Whole-wheat-meal or bran bread, made with yeast, are 
excellent types of bulky foods, which, at the same time, 
will supply the child not only with ballast and minerals 
and other food principles, but with the vitamins, or life- 
giving principles found in the husks of wheat, as well as 
in other foods. These breads are richer in general 
nutriment than white bread, so, if a sweet filling is to be 
used, it will balance to best advantage in this com- 
bination. 

The following fillings are particularly good for these 
breads : Cottage cheese and chopped walnut meats ; 
peanut butter and well-drained, stewed prunes; thick 
honey and sliced bananas, sprinkled with lemon juice ; 
cottage cheese and sliced tomatqes; dates and cream 
cheese ; cold welsh rarebit made with milk ; cream cheese 
and marmalade; ground dried beef, cooked in a thick 
tomato sauce and a little grated cheese. In all of these 
cases the butter should be beaten to a cream and spread 
out to the edge of the slice. Jf cake or other sweets are 
provided, sweet sandwiches should be used sparingly. 
In all cases the filling should be moist, but not wet enough 
to make the bread soggy; the slices should be cut not 
more than a quarter of an inch thick, as, otherwise, the 
children will get too much bread for the amount of 
filling. 

White bread sandwiches should usually have a sub- 
stantial filling of meat, cheese, nuts, or eggs ; fish should 
not be used, as it imparts odors and is likely to spoil 
through conflicting temperatures. If the bread is com- 
paratively fresh and moist, thinly-sliced tender meat can 
be used if the bread is spread with enough butter to 
make the slices cling together. However, in many cases, 
it is a better plan to mince the meat and cook it in a 
thick white sauce, as this makes a moist filling and at the 
same time utilizes meat that cannot be sliced. Whenever 
possible, it is a good plan to provide one or two vegetable 



THE CHILDREN'S MEALS 49 

sandwiches. These may be made of well-dried lettuce 
leaves, chopped celery, sliced radishes, spinach mixed 
with a little cream cheese, or even well-drained string 
beans dressed with a little olive oil and lemon juice. 
Fruits, like sliced and sugared peaches, also can be used 
as fillings. For meats the variety is unlimited; thin 
cakes of broiled hamburg steak; crisp, but not dry, 
bacon, and broiled ham, all helping out the usual cold 
meats. Whatever the sandwich, it should always be 
wrapped in paraffine paper to prevent dryness. Some- 
times cold corn bread or muffins can be used to good ad- 
vantage, and there are always the quick loaf breads, as 
Boston brown bread, nut bread, raisin loaf and whole- 
wheat date bread that can fill in an emergency. 

Whenever possible, a tid-bit, as radishes, celery, or 
ripe olives, should be furnished. Dessert may consist 
of some simple cake, preferably of the sponge variety or 
wholesome cookies, as the old-fashioned gingersnaps, or 
sugar cookies, and the more modern oatmeal cakes. 
Stewed fruit may be furnished, or a custard, or a single 
portion of cereal pudding, baked in a jelly glass, will 
often furnish a welcome change. ' A delicate child that 
needs special nourishment should be provided with a hot- 
cold bottle for milk, soup, or cocoa. 

The following menus are well adapted to the average 
child.

CHAPTER IV 
THE PROBLEM OF THE DINNER PAIL 

Two triangles of pie, a piece of cake, some white bread 
sandwiches, spread sparingly with butter, usually put 
together with jelly or jam, a dill pickle, and, on rare 
occasions, a bit of cheese this is the typical noon lunch 
carried by the average workman. If eaten constantly, 
this diet, which consists almost entirely of starch and 
sweets, is liable to cause ill health and lead {6 disease. 

Few realize that dinner-pail meals need greater thought 
than those served at the table. Only too often they lack 
variety, are unattractively packed, and are made up of 
any left-overs that chance to be at hand in the early 
morning hours. 

The choice of a luncheon receptacle is of great im- 
portance ; leather is not to be considered, because foods 
absorb the odor ; the ordinary collapsible tin box does 
not hold enough for a full meal; papier mdche soon 
grows musty, while the usual tin pail is apt to rust. The 
most attractive utensil is an enamel dinner pail, fitted 
with trays. This may be thoroughly scalded and aired 
each day, and, with care, will last indefinitely. The next 
best solution is a pasteboard box, fresh daily. These may 
be obtained in quantity from any wholesale stationer, 
and occupy little storage space. Unattractive packing 
often spoils an otherwise good meal. Waxed or paraf- 
fine paper is indispensable, as, by its use, foods are not 
only kept moist, but are prevented from taking on the 
mixture of flavors that permeate a lunch box when the 
foods are not carefully wrapped. This may be pur- 
chased, inexpensively, by the pound, from the stationer. 
Each sandwich should be wrapped in the paper, sepa- 
rately, and secured by a rubber band. This makes pos- 
sible the introduction of piquant flavors, as onions, horse- 
radish, etc. By this means pie, sliced cold meats, cheese 
and cake may be kept moist ; even fruit should be wrapped 
to keep the odor from escaping. 

50 



THE DINNER PAIL 51 

A large jelly tumbler, or small fruit- jar, may be used 
for moist foods, like baked beans, creamed vegetables, 
meats and salads, and for cooked cereals, with milk, pre- 
served fruit, baked custards or puddings. For such 
foods the spoon should not be forgotten, while a small 
linen napkin is always a much appreciated luxury. 

While the noon lunch should be neatly packed, with 
due regard to the order in which the foods will be eaten 

for the working man is only too seldom supplied with 
a table on which to " spread " his meal it should not 
be too " dainty." No hungry man will be satisfied with 
a few paper-thin sandwiches, a piece of delicate cake, and 
small portions of fruit or pudding. He usually reports 
for work by seven in the morning, and the long stretch 
of five hours till noon, coupled with actual physical labor, 
creates a ravenous appetite that demands quantity. If 
care is taken to balance the meal, leaving, however, more 
starch and sugar than is usual to re-supply this rapidly 
dissipated energy, he will eat less and keep in better 
trim than when it is disregarded. As a general rule men 
feel that they have " nothing to eat,"* 3 unless meat is pro- 
vided ; so, when meat substitutes are given, they must be 
planned so that they " look " like a large amount in order 
to appease the hungry eyes. At the same time, it should 
be borne in mind that many meat substitutes are not so 
concentrated as meat, thus making it necessary to pre- 
pare a larger amount to provide the same degree of 
nourishment. 

The season of the year should always be considered 

a luncheon of heavy foods, suitable to cold weather, 
being unappetizing during the warm summer months. 
A man at hard labor always needs substantial foods, but 
fruit, vegetable and meat substitutes may be more gen- 
erally introduced with the coming of spring they will 
largely overcome the usual tendencies toward " spring 
fever." 

An earnest housewife said, " My husband carries a din- 
ner-pail and is dyspeptic ; he has no means of heating the 
food. What can I do to make it more digestible ? " The 
answer was, " Provide a hot soup by means of a hot- 
cold bottle." When, the body is weary the stomach 
needs " toning up." The best way to do this is by means 



52 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

of a hot soup or drink, as it stimulates the stomach to im- 
mediate action. As " hot-cold " bottles may be purchased 
from fifty cents up, a little economy will place them 
within reach of almost anyone. Occasionally, factories 
provide " hot closets," so that coffee or food may be left 
there to heat. This makes possible a greater variety of 
foods. 

There is nothing so jading to the appetite as monotony. 
A constant diet of white bread, some kind of pie and 
cake, always made by the same recipe, soon gets a man 
to the point where nothing " tastes good." The lunch 
box offers just as great opportunity for thought and skill 
as the finest company meal if imagination is called into 
play. Many foods ordinarily served hot are acceptable 
when cold; sandwich fillings may be prepared in many 
odd combinations and desserts replace the too frequent 
pie. A surprise now and then, as salted or cracked nuts, 
or a few pieces of candy, mean as much to a grown-up 
as to a child. 

The following menus contain suggestions for the differ- 
ent seasons : 

For Fall and Winter 

Sliced Meat Loaf Potato Chips 

Bread and Jelly Sandwiches Plain Bread and Butter 

Baked Apple with Top Milk Gingerbread

The best gauge of a hungry man's appetite is what 
is or is not left over in the pail. There can be no definite 
rule given as to quantity the amount needed by various 
people differing with the kind of work and individuality. 
If the ration is approximately balanced, amounts may 
soon be judged. 

Occasionally a few slices of cold meat may be in- 
troduced, as in the first menu. As these are usually eaten 
with the fingers, this should not be done unless there is a 
lavatory at hand. When pie is used, it belongs in a 
menu that seems deficient in heavy food, as in the second 
and last menus. When cereals are used, care should al- 
ways be taken to secure the whole grains, such as brown 
rice, cracked wheat, and oatmeal, as they are not only 
more bulky, but far more nourishing than the denatured 
kinds. Fruits, either fresh or dried, should be fully in- 
troduced, as they are invaluable tonics and appetizers, and 
every menu should contain some one food of marked 
flavor to give it point. 

To put foods together that harmonize, that are, at the 
same time, inexpensive and nourishing is worthy the high- 
est effort, for what a man is and does depends largely 
upon what he eats. 



CHAPTER V 
THE FINE ART OF COMBINING FOODS 

The question of the proper thing to serve at each meal 
is one that confronts every housewife, and often proves 
very perplexing. Many women seem to feel that, when 
the main dish has been selected, the other foods will take 
care of themselves. But no meal can be piled together 
helter-skelter, for in planning the menu some one dish 
must be selected around which the rest of the meal re- 
volves. The main dish, properly speaking, is repre- 
sented by the most substantial course, but the meal can 
often be made to fit around a special dessert or salad. A 
correspondent, for instance, asked for a company dinner 
menu in which the dessert might be grape juice jelly, with 
whipped cream. Taking into consideration the three fac- 
tors that must be observed in planning every meal, no 
matter how simple, the dietetic value of the food, pleas- 
ing the palate, and satisfying the eyes I sent her the 
following menu : 

Oyster Bouillon Wafers 

Chicken Maryland 
Timbales of Green Peppers with Rice Browned Cauliflower 

Celery Hearts 

Grapejuice Jelly, with Whipped Cream Orange Cakes 
Coffee 

In this menu the jelly acts as the point of interest; that 
is the flavors of the meal reach in it a climax. There is 
nothing so unsatisfying as to finish a well-cooked meal 
which is so badly planned that it leaves an impression of 
monotony. Many a case of overeating and consequent 
indigestion may be traced to the combination of too many 
foods on the same taste-level. The palate, which is very 
sensitive in its search for something distinctive in flavor, 
is so continually disappointed that one may unconsciously 
keep on eating long after the appetite is satisfied. The 

54 



THE FINE ART OF COMBINING FOODS 55 

term taste-level applies to foods which are made of sim- 
ilar ingredients. 

I have often heard an old Southern Mammy say that 
every white vegetable should have a green or dark one 
to balance it at a meal. This rule is not infallible, but, 
generally speaking, the white vegetables, as hominy, rice, 
potatoes and macaroni, are of a starchy nature, and, to 
carry out the balance of the meal, a green vegetable rich 
in minerals should be provided. In case one of the more 
succulent white vegetables is chosen, like cauliflower, 
which will furnish ample mineral, the meal will not taste 
well unless either the starchy or the mineral vegetable is 
darkened in some way, as browned cauliflower or fried 
potatoes. In case a third vegetable is to be added, it 
should be of contrasting color, that is potatoes, carrots 
and spinach may be used together, or rice, tomatoes and 
string beans, but fried potatoes, white turnips, and cauli- 
flower, would not be a good combination. 

A white fish or meat should be served with a sauce of 
contrasting flavor and color. In preparing the gravy for 
roast meats, for example, it should be made of a rich 
dark brown color; otherwise it will look insipid. Light 
meats, such as pork tenderloin, veal cutlets and the like, 
are much better when combined with tomato, or some 
dark sauce, and, if chicken is to be creamed, the addition 
of an egg yolk or two, or some minced parsley or green 
pepper, to give color value as well as additional flavor, is 
an excellent plan. Very dark foods, such as spinach, 
timbales, baked tomatoes and so on, should be combined 
with light colored sauces and vice versa. This also ap- 
plies to puddings. 

The greatest help in planning combinations is to 
schedule meals ahead for at least a day, preferably for 
the week, leaving one meal blank to take care of the left- 
overs. Lack of variety shows very plainly when put 
down in black and white. 

Every meal must be planned by a pattern or skeleton 
menu, whether just for the family or for company. If 
these patterns are kept in plain view whenever the menus 
are made, there will be little danger of providing unbal- 
anced rations. I find it an excellent plan to build up the 
meals by aid of skeleton menus, such as the following: 



56 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Breakfast 

1. Fruit, raw or cooked. 

2. Cereal with top milk, only with cooked fruits, or 
those partially non-acid, as pears, bananas or melons. 

3. Eggs, left-over meat, fish, or, occasionally, a vege- 
table, and milk or egg combinations ; potatoes only when 
cereal is omitted ; any bread, with butter, cereal beverage 
or coffee. 

Cocoa should not be served unless the supply of but- 
ter is diminished, and the main course is very light. If 
desired, the cereal may take a different form, as fried 
mush or hominy omelet. In this case any kind of raw 
fruit may be served. 

Luncheon or Supper 

1. Any fruit cocktail, canape, or cream or stock soup, 
with crackers. (This course may be omitted.) 

2. Any light meat, egg, nut or cheese dish, as scallops, 
timbales, croquettes, ramekins, or substantial vegetable 
or cereal dishes, combined with proteins; any kind of 
bread. 

3. A light salad of fruit or vegetables, with boiled, 
French, or mayonnaise dressing. 

4. A light dessert, as fresh or cooked fruit, whips, 
gelatines, or corn starch puddings, accompanied, if de- 
sired, with cookies, cake, hot gingerbread, or waffles; 
tea. 

If a heavy soup, as a bisque, puree, or egg- thickened 
soup, is served, the meat course may be omitted. If 
potatoes, rice or spaghetti are provided, in addition to 
the main course, the dessert should be light. For an 
elaborate meal a light vegetable, such as green peas, may 
accompany the main course. If desired, a substantial 
meat, fish or vegetable and nut salad may be substituted 
for the second and third courses. A fruit salad may be 
the dessert. Neither milk nor cocoa should be served 
unless needed to supply a scanty protein allowance. A 
heavy dessert is allowable only when needed to give bal- 
ance to the meal. If deficient in protein, an egg custard 
may be used ; if lacking in fat, an almond pudding, but- 
terscotch pie and so fort!]. 



THE FINE ART OF COMBINING FOODS 57 

Dinner 

1. Any fruit or fish cocktail, canape, or stock soup and 
crackers. (This course may be omitted.) 

2. Any substantial meat or fish, baked, boiled, braized, 
fried, broiled, stewed, or en casserole. A choice of white 
or sweet potatoes, rice, hominy, or macaroni. One or 
two other vegetables. 

3. Any vegetable salad with French dressing, or one 
of its derivatives, or with very fat meats, an orange or 
grapefruit salad, with French dressing ; a green vegetable, 
as celery or radishes, may be substituted. If the salad 
is of fruit, it may be supplemented with crackers or sweet 
biscuits, and act as dessert. 

4. A light dessert, as junket, gelatine, whip, fruit cup, 
baked oranges, baked stuffed apples with heavy meats. 
Heavier desserts, as pies, puddings, tapioca cream and so 
forth, with light meats. Only tart desserts with fish. 
Coffee. 

If fish is served as a separate course, it should precede 
the meat, and be in the form of timbales, croquettes, 
ramekins, or small portions of broiled or boiled fish, with 
or without sauce. 

As appetite craves change, the essential in planning ap- 
pealing meals is to combine a variety of foods so that 
they harmonize. Nature is a trustworthy teacher. 
Years ago she taught the good old combination of pork 
and beans, bread and cheese, pork and apple sauce, be- 
cause they tasted well together her pupils not realiz- 
ing that these foods supplemented each the other. 

To prepare foods that " taste good," look well and are 
digestible it is a good plan to follow the infallible rule of 
" enough but not too much," as well as to consider the 
esthetic beauty and appearance of the combination. Con- 
servatism too often stands in the way of the average 
housewife, many serving the same dishes year in and 
year out, that their mothers served before them. How- 
ever, the women are not entirely at fault, the habits of the 
men contributing a large share towards the existing nar- 
rowness. The New Englander is starved without his 
breakfast doughnuts ; the Southerner without his corn 
pone, and the Westerner without his wheat cakes, regard- 



58 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

less of the fact that the meal may contain dishes of equal 
stability and nutrition. 

Another reason why women get into " ruts " is because 
too many men seem to like monotony being satisfied 
with frequent repetitions of a few good dishes, often ridi- 
culing any attempt toward growth and betterment in the 
family menu. The man who growls over the " high cost 
of living " is too often the one who demands the same 
old foods ! 

Breakfast is usually the most neglected of the three 
meals, actual scantiness of food, combinations which are 
indigestible, and hasty service leading to frequent mid- 
morning indigestion and consequent " grouchiness." 
One of the greatest mistakes perpetrated in most house- 
holds is the serving of an acid fruit with a cereal or 
cream. Some cast-iron stomachs can stand this combina- 
tion, but often it brings about fermentation with accom- 
panying gas. When a cereal is to be served, the fruit 
should be bland, as bananas, peaches, apples, dates, stewed 
figs or prunes, not only because it is the correct thing 
to do, but because it " tastes good." In this case the 
heavier part of the meal should be scheduled accordingly 
and contain foods of marked flavor. If scrambled eggs, 
for instance, follow a bland fruit, and cereal with cream, 
the effect is flat; while, on the other hand, if a little 
dried beef or bacon is cooked with the eggs, or if they 
are made into an omelet with tomato sauce, the whole 
meal gains point. However, if the meal starts with an 
acid, like oranges, pineapple or grapefruit, the main por- 
tion may be heavier and somewhat bland. Plain scram- 
bled eggs should be suitable in this case and might be 
accompanied by fried potatoes (to give substantiality) 
and corn muffins, as no cereal is served. Fish never 
should be served for breakfast, unless preceded by an 
acid fruit, or accompanied by an acid sauce. Potatoes 
or hominy should never be served when a cereal appears, 
as all are starches, and, therefore, too similar in texture 
and taste. When steak and potatoes are served, for in- 
stance, the cereal should be omitted. When cereal is 
used, plain bread and butter, biscuits or rolls should be 
prepared, while cereal muffins may be used when the 
cereal is omitted. In other words care should be taken 



THE FINE ART OF COMBINING FOODS 59 

not to repeat similar flavors. When fried foods, like frit- 
ters or griddle cakes, are used, an acid fruit should ap- 
pear, not only because it tastes better, but because the 
acid assists in breaking up the fat in which they are 
usually cooked. 

For example, examine the following winter breakfast 
menu : 

Sliced Oranges 

Ham and Eggs Creamed Potatoes 

Hot Biscuits and Maple Syrup 

Coffee 

The orange acid cuts the ham fat, the potatoes are 
moist and act as a sauce to the ham, while the syrup adds 
a sweet note without which the meal would be incom- 
plete. 

As the weather grows warmer, heavy dishes should be 
partially replaced by foods Nature has provided. Let- 
tuce, cress, asparagus and rhubarb, as well as the early 
fruits, have a definite place in the spring breakfast. 

To illustrate : 

Stewed Rhubarb 

Broiled Mackerel Baked Potatoes 

Corn Muffins Coffee 



Brown Rice Brown Sugar Syrup 

Creamed Asparagus on Toast 
Strawberry Shortcake Coffee 

In the first menu the acid rhubarb cuts the fat mackerel 
and gives the sour flavor that fish demands ; corn muffins 
are used instead of cereal, while baked potatoes supply 
the needed bulk to satisfy the appetite. In the second 
menu the brown rice, which is not denatured and, there- 
fore, substantial, is used instead of the meat, as the as- 
paragus on toast is served in a milk sauce, and syrup is 
served with the cereal instead of milk in order to avoid 
repetition of flavor ; while the fruit is combined with the 
hot bread into a shortcake. 

Luncheon, or supper, as the lightest meal of the day, 
offers great opportunity for unusual combinations, not 
only of foods purchased for the purpose, but of left- 
overs. The fall and winter seasons call for hot soups, 



60 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

escallops and warm desserts, while spring and summer 
suggest dishes of light and cooling character. 

A good combination for one meal is not enough ; it 
is the ensemble of the day that leaves a feeling of com- 
plete satisfaction. The character of luncheon depends 
somewhat upon the occupation of those who are to eat it. 
Active bodies need heavy foods, so in winter, when pro- 
vision is to be made for children and hungry men, " rough 
and ready " dishes may be utilized, as beans, peas and 
lentils ; the thick soups, Indian pudding, hot gingerbread, 
etc. Whenever a light main dish is served, the dessert 
should be heavy, while a heavy main course calls for a 
light dessert. Plum pudding, for instance, is out of place 
after a substantial dinner, but may be used to advantage 
as a luncheon dessert. 

Heavy salads fit better into the light luncheon than in 
any other place, and often form the main dish, while a 
fruit salad is always acceptable in place of dessert. 
When a meat soup is served, the main dish should be 
largely vegetarian, as a potato or nut salad, a cheese 
souffle, or eggs. In case the main dish is cold the dessert 
should be hot, as an apple shortcake, while a hot main 
dishj like stewed lentils, calls for a cold dessert, as 
jellied peaches and cake. In other words, delicious- 
ness of combination depends upon contrast in tempera- 
ture as well as flavor. Cream soups are in place only 
at luncheon or supper, because they are so heavy that 
they partly satisfy the appetite. To this end they should 
be counted as having actual food value while the clear 
dinner soup is used more as a stimulant. A cream soup 
is always bland m taste, and should be followed by some 
strong-flavored dish of firm texture ; for instance, creamed 
chicken is too similar in texture to harmonize. Toasted 
ham sandwiches, croquettes or salads give a better effect. 

The following luncheon menus illustrate this point : 

Fall and Winter 

Cream of Lima Bean Soup Croutons 

Nut and Potato Croquettes Nut Sauce 

Orange and Date Salad Ginger Cookies 
Tea 



THE FINE ART OF COMBINING FOODS 61 

Clear Meat Soup 

Baked Cheese Celery Hot Toast 

Mince Pie 

Spring and Summer 

Veal and Egg Salad Warm Biscuits 

Shredded Pineapple Sponge Cake 

Iced Tea 



Halibut Loaf Peas Potato Chips 

Lettuce and Radish Salad 
Cream Cake Raspberry Lemonade 

The perfect winter dinner commences with soup, which 
starts the gastric juices, preparing the stomach for the 
balance of the meal. As a general rule any clear soup is 
in order, made, however, from meat stock of different 
flavor from the meat to be served. Meats lacking in 
flavor, like veal or young chicken, should be preceded by 
tomato, cress, celery or some other soup of distinct flavor. 
Oyster bouillon, for instance, is too bland to serve with 
veal; on the other hand, heavy meats, like beef, pork or 
mutton, need delicate soups, as lettuce or green pea. 
Whipped cream should never be served in a dinner soup, 
as it adds too much to the already large amount of fat. 

When the weather grows warm, it is permissible to 
commence the meal with a fruit cup, in which case fruit 
should not appear again on the menu. Iced soups and 
bouillons are in good taste during this season. 

In planning the main portion of the meal, one rule is 
inviolate potatoes, rice and spaghetti should never ap- 
pear in the same meal, because they are too similar. 
When two vegetables are to be served, one should be 
green, like asparagus or string beans, and one of more 
plebeian character, like onions or beets. 

Fat meats need fresh vegetables and tart flavors to 
" cut them " ; beef and pork can stand the standard vege- 
tables, while game needs harmonizing foods. 

The following lists of foods that may be served to- 
gether are necessarily incomplete, but they will undoubt- 
edly act as a guide to any thinking housewife who desires 
to make her meals harmonious: 

What to Serve ivith Beef: If roasted, pot-roasted, 
boiled or braised, use mashed, whole browned, baked or 



62 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

boiled, new potatoes,; for steak use mashed or French 
fried potatoes. Other vegetables may be onions, squash, 
Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, string 
beans, spinach, corn, dandelion greens, celery, peppers and 
carrots. All plain salad plants, with French dressing, 
may be used, as cucumbers, tomatoes, celery, cabbage, 
beets, onion or green pepper salad, the vegetables either 
separate or in combination. For desserts choose light 
dishes, such as fruit tarts, fruit cups, small dumplings, 
small portions of cereal or bread pudding, layer cake, 
fruit whips, small portions of Spanish cream or corn 
starch pudding, made with water (not milk). 

What to Serve with Lamb or Mutton: With roast 
mutton use the same vegetables as with roast beef. With 
roast lamb use rice, mashed or whole-boiled new potatoes, 
green peas, string beans, fresh lima beans, sliced toma- 
toes, summer squash, Bermuda onions, diced white tur- 
nips or asparagus. With boiled or braised mutton or 
lamb use boiled white or sweet potatoes, yellow or white 
turnips, oyster plant, onions, string beans, spinach, Brus- 
sels sprouts, ten-minute cabbage, carrots or cauliflower. 
Use any salad plants, with plain French dressing, or cel- 
ery, chives, or fines herbes, sliced tomatoes, bananas, 
tart oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, green pepper, boiled 
chestnuts, or pimentoes, in combination with a salad 
plant. The dessert should be distinctive in flavor, and 
may include anything made of fruit, coffee jelly, with 
nut cookies, sponge cake or plain layer cake put together 
with raspberry jam, any light fruit ice, as apricot ice, 
bread puddings with fruit flavor, boiled caramel custard, 
caramel Spanish cream, and steamed snow puffs with 
grape juice sauce. 

What to Serve with Veal: Use mashed, boiled, new, 
or browned potatoes, diced white turnips, all kinds of 
greens, beets with orange sauce, peas, string beans, ten- 
minute or escalloped cabbage, German carrots or aspara- 
gus. Use any salad plant with French dressing plain or 
combined with chopped chives, fines herbes, pickled car- 
rots, sliced tomatoes, green peppers, celery, pimentoes, 
tomato jelly or shredded new cabbage. The desserts may 
be the same as for lamb or mutton. 

What to Serve with Pork and Goose: Mashed, boiled 



THE FINE ART OF COMBINING FOODS 63 

or baked white or sweet potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, 
oyster-plant, turnips, apple sauce, stewed tomatoes. For 
salad use any of the salad plants, with French dressing, 
singly or in combination, or with green peppers, celery, 
shredded cabbage, sliced tart apples, grapefruit or tomato 
jelly. The desserts should be light, consisting either of 
fruit or fruit cups, simple fruit dumplings, or fruit whips 
or gelatine. 

What to Serve with Poultry: Mashed, roasted or 
boiled white or sweet potatoes, cauliflower, Brussels 
sprouts, winter or summer squash, chestnuts, mushrooms, 
corn, peas, string beans, celery, raw or cooked, green 
peppers stuffed with vegetables, cranberry sauce or jelly. 

Asparagus should be used with broiled chicken. The 
salads may be the same as those given for lamb with the 
addition of asparagus salad. The desserts may be some- 
what heavier in character, although fruit and fruit des- 
serts are always correct. If desired, they may take the 
form of ice creams or Bavarian creams, while simple 
steamed puddings and small portions of well-flavored 
custards, and simple shortcakes may be used. 

What to Serve with Corned Beef: Boiled potatoes, 
white or sweet, parsnips, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauli- 
flower, turnips, beets, carrots, and any kind of greens. 
For salads select any of those to be served with beef. 
The dessert should be " homey," such as warm ginger- 
bread, apple pie, or doughnuts and cheese. 

What to Serve with Game: As game is somewhat 
light, the accompanying vegetables are usually elaborate. 
Among those suitable are white or sweet potato cro- 
quettes, celery plain, au gratin, or creamed, sweet potato 
glace, stuffed, broiled or fried tomatoes, creamed spinach, 
peas in timbale cases, peppers stuffed with boiled rice, 
escalloped cauliflower, or Brussels sprouts. 

Ripe olives, barberry or black or red-currant jelly may 
be provided. The salads should be plain, preferably of 
a combination of salad plants with fines herbes. Other- 
wise, choose celery, tomato or a tart fruit salad. The 
dessert should be simple, including only a fruit ice with 
sponge cakes, a fruit tup, baked stuffed apples, or some- 
thing that will carry out the general idea of naturalness 
which should surround a game dinner. 



64 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

What to Serve with Fish: Plain boiled potatoes dusted 
with parsley, roast potatoes, French fried or white or 
sweet potato croquettes ; onions, stuffed green peppers, 
tomatoes, stewed, broiled, fried or baked ; ten-minute cab- 
bage, turnips, celery, pickled beets, pickled carrots, any 
kind of greens. Use any of the salads designated for veal. 
Only dessert with a fruit foundation or flavor should 
be used. 

Fruit salads are much out of place in the dinner menu, 
unless they figure as the last course, when they are served 
with crackers, cheese and coffee. They are naturally 
sweet, and, when followed by a dessert, the palate is apt 
to become clogged with sweet. As a general rule sweets 
and savories do not mix, although occasionally they can 
be blended, as currant sauce with ham, orange fritters 
with duck, or pineapple or orange and celery salad with 
game. These exceptions must, however, be introduced 
with sparing hand, as they often strike a wrong note 
that sets the whole meal askew. 

The heavy salad, swathed with mayonnaise or boiled 
dressing, is entirely out of place at dinner because it over- 
loads the menu with fat. Only salads of green vegetables 
should be selected, like lettuce, pepper and cauliflower, 
tomato and cress, cabbage and celery, etc., French dress- 
ing with variations alone being suitable. 

Dessert depends entirely on the rest of the meal. 
Fruit, either fresh or cooked, is always acceptable with 
fish or fat meats ; pies and steamed puddings are suitable 
when the meat course is light, as chops or cold meat. 
Old-fashioned desserts, like doughnuts and cheese and 
Indian Pudding, should be used with meats like corned 
beef or pork. A country housewife remarked, " Some- 
how a corned-beef dinner and ice cream don't keep com- 
pany!" This is somewhat a matter of sentiment, but 
more of the combinations of flavors. Ordinary flavors 
do not combine with those of the more delicate type. The 
two types clash, and do not " harmonize " any more than 
walking shoes do with evening dress. Each has its place, 
but they must" be differentiated. The following menus 
are illustrative : '

CHAPTER VI 
SEASONINGS 

As a general rule typical American cookery is liable to 
be flat and uninteresting, not necessarily because of the 
use of poor ingredients, but because the average house- 
wife does not understand the importance of good season- 
ing. The thing that starts the digestive juices " makes 
the mouth water " is the delicious aroma arising from 
food well-cooked and seasoned, and this savor cannot be 
obtained by salt and pepper alone. Besides, the use of 
too much of these " stand-bys " has a bad effect on the 
body, the excess salt irritating the mucous membranes, 
and pepper having an injurious action on the blood and 
liver. 

During the warm weather it is not at all difficult to 
obtain the enticing food-flavors that make eating some- 
thing more than a necessity for Nature is bountiful; gar- 
den, market and roadside combining to furnish a variety 
of herbs. Years ago when everyone had a kitchen gar- 
den the herb corner was the special care of the house- 
wife, for she realized that not only the savoriness of her 
meats and soups depended upon herbs, but frequently the 
charm of her cakes and confections as well. Moreover, 
though she may not have known it, she was unwittingly 
supplying her family with some of Nature's best medi- 
cines. 

If possible, herbs, like all other foods, should be used 
fresh. Even in winter, some of them can be grown in 
the house in window boxes and others may be obtained 
from large markets throughout the year. Further, it is 
an easy matter to put up, or dry, almost any of the herbs. 
To preserve them so that they will be fresh enough to use 
at any time, even as garnishes, arrange alternate layers 
of salt and sprigs of the desired herb (parsley, dill, sage, 
mint, etc.) in wide-mouthed jars and keep them well 

66 ' 



SEASONINGS 67 

covered with salt, in a cool place. Dill, parsley, celery 
tips, mint, sage, thyme, marjoram and other herbs can 
also be put up in cold water, like cranberries or rhubarb. 
Select fresh, green sprigs, finse well and put them into 
jars which have been thoroughly scalded and then cooled. 
Let cold water run from the faucet into the jars for at 
least ten minutes so that all the air will be dislodged, then 
seal with a rubber band and cap as usual. 

Herbs may be dried in two ways : They should be free 
from dirt; if necessary, they can be washed and thor- 
oughly dried before the actual process of evaporation 
begins. Pick off the sprigs and lay them on clean papers 
in a warm room where no sweeping will be done for at 
least two days. Turn occasionally till thoroughly dry 
and store in tightly-closed tin boxes, for the savor is best 
preserved if the herbs are kept dark and the receptacle is 
air-tight. The second method is more rapid; place the 
sprigs on brown paper and dry, either in a slow oven or 
on wire trays which may be suspended on pulleys above 
the stove. In country districts these trays are invalu- 
able for drying corn, lima beans and other vegetables, as 
well as fruit. To freshen dried herbs, place in a little 
warm water for a few minutes. 

There are times when a food needs the enlivening 
touch of sour, or sweet-sour, pickles. -For sauce to serve 
with lamb or fish, capers are usually suggested, but they 
are rather expensive and may be substituted by nasturtium 
seed, which can be used plain, as a relish, in salads, or 
as a decoration for salads or canapes. Cucumber pickles 
of medium size may be sliced lengthwise, very thin, spread 
out in fan-shape and used to garnish baked beans. Finely 
chopped, they add a good note to boiled or mayonnaise 
dressing, or they may be added direct to a salad. 
Pickled string beans, or flowerets of cauliflower, are de- 
licious with ham or tongue. Olives may often be used 
to give variety, either with salads or sandwiches, or in 
various cooked dishes, as creamed shrimps or salmon. 
There are times when plain or spiced meat or fish ab- 
solutely palls. When this occurs, it is a good plan to 
introduce a tart flavor or a sour sauce. Beef a la mode 
is a good example of a commonly known tart meat. It 
is often advisable to add a little vinegar or lemon to 



68 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

boiling meat or fish ; a dash of vinegar is indispensable 
when cooking kidneys, and sour cream may be added to 
the gravy of different meat dishes, or may be made into 
a delicious fish sauce when a faint tart flavor is desired ; 
plain sliced lemon is delicious with tongue. 

Tomatoes, which are acid and at the same time very 
pungent, may be called upon for tart sauces, and are in- 
valuable for seasoning casseroles and soups. However, 
it should not be repeated too often, for the spice of sea- 
soning lies in frequent change. Certain meats demand 
a sweet-sour flavor; cider when added to boiled ham be- 
ing an example, or thin slices of ham baked in grape 
juice is another. Tongue with raisin sauce shows still 
a third possibility. Sometimes a bit of sweet will help a 
meat more than anything else, a few grains of sugar either 
plain or caramelized greatly improving veal or a brown 
beef stew and other meats. 

To Caramelize Sugar 

Put the sugar in a smooth frying pan, set it over a 
slow heat and let it gradually melt until the color of 
maple syrup; it will then be very hot and if combined 
with a liquid, no matter if it is boiling, it will harden and 
must be cooked in the liquid again until melted, before 
being used. 

A seasoning that every one can have, yet which few 
appreciate, is the onion. Unless it is to appear in a stew, 
or is very finely minced, only the juice should be used, 
as this is the one means by which the flavor can be evenly 
diffused. To obtain the juice, select a large onion but 
do not peel it. Cut off the top and scrape the surface 
with a spoon till the juice is exhausted, slice off another 
layer and proceed as before till the necessary amount is 
obtained. A clove of garlic, if peeled and rubbed around 
the edge of a salad bowl, gives an especially subtle flavor, 
but garlic must be used sparingly as it is the strongest of 
all flavors. Onion- and celery-salts are very useful in 
quick-time cookery, a dash of celery salt frequently re- 
deeming a plain soup, a dish of creamed fish or meat; 
onion salt helping many, many a soup, sandwich, or a 
meat dish. 



SEASONINGS 69 

There are many commercial sauces which greatly help 
to make ordinary fare " different," but, as a general rule, 
they are thought rather expensive. However, consider- 
ing the time they last, the ultimate expense is small. A 
half teaspoonful of Worcestershire, if added to a French 
dressing, will liven any simple salad, and besides being 
well adapted to plain service with meat, it is particularly 
good when added to certain soups, to gravies, such as 
those from hamburg steaks and veal chops; or to shell- 
fish, or cheese rarebits. " Kitchen Bouquet " gives color 
and flavor to any anemic-looking broth or gravy and to 
some vegetable sauces. The various ketchups are espe- 
cially useful, tomato lending itself to French dressing, 
soups, sauces and gravies, while walnut- and mushroom- 
ketchups are especially good for seasoning sauces for 
fame. Tabasco adds a live note to vegetable, meat or 
sh soups and is invaluable in clam, oyster, crab, or mush- 
room cocktails. Even a grating of lemon or orange rind 
sometimes gives just the note that is needed to raw oy- 
sters or clams. 

There is no greater incentive for variety in seasoning 
than to have the ingredients well-assembled. Chefs 
realize this to such degree that many of them cook with 
an herb tray at hand. These are divided into compart- 
ments, each being filled with a different kind of dried or 
powdered herb. In the household, however, it is not prac- 
ticable to adopt this plan, because, when exposed to the 
air, herbs soon lose much of their savor, and in home 
cooking comparatively small amounts are used. A wicker 
basket with a handle may be kept near the stove and in 
it may be placed small jars of the different dried herbs 
most in use, whole cloves, bay leaves, mace and other 
spices, celery seed, the various commercial sauces, as well 
as shakers of paprika, cayenne, salt, and a mixture of 
seven parts salt to one of pepper, ready for use. These 
should be clearly labeled on the top of each can when a 
glance will show just what is needed and often suggest 
blends of seasoning that would otherwise not be thought 
of. 

Following are a few suggestions for inexpensive sea- 
sonings. 



70 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Bouquet of Herbs 

A small bundle of fresh or dried herbs containing a 
sprig each of parsley, sage, marjoram, chervil and thyme. 
Use in the stock pot, for pot-roasting, and in boiling fish 
and spaghetti. If the leaves are loose, tie in a bit of 
cheesecloth. 

Fines Herbes 

A combination of herbs minced together; made up of a 
teaspoonful of parsley and a half-teaspoonful each of 
marjoram, savory, chervil and a little sage. Sprinkle 
over broiled, or planked, fish, place in the fold of an 
omelet, strew over shirred eggs, or serve with lettuce or 
romaine. Dried herb leaves may be used if freshened 
in warm water. Use in stuffing for baked cabbage or 
game. 

Mint 

Use fresh in mint sauce, cabbage and mint salad, 
drinks, as orange mintade and angel tip, orange and mint 
salad, fruit cocktails, hot or iced tea, or lemonade ; fresh, 
or dry, in a casserole of duck, apple jelly or gelatine, 
canned or dried pea soup and with peas. 

Bay Leaves 

Use sparingly in meat soups, bisques made of had- 
dock and cod, or stewed tomato ; cream of tomato or 
celery soup. Boil with veal, ham, game and fish. Use 
in warm water. Use in stuffing for baked cabbage or 
meat or fish and in brown and tomato sauces. 

Parsley 

Use sparingly, fresh, or dried and freshened; with 
omelets, shirred eggs, and chopped meat, mushrooms, 
broiled tomatoes, buttered potatoes, in butter sauce for 
fish, in soups and salads. 

Dill 

Use fresh, or dried and freshened; in egg salad, plain 
salads, creamed soups and on broiled fish. 



SEASONINGS 71 

Dried Mushroom Trimmings 

Use as a basis for mushroom soup, mushroom sauce, 
and in cream or brown sauce for oysters, veal, fish, 
chicken and any place where a mushroom flavor is de- 
sirable. 

Sage 

Use fresh or dry with beef, ham, or pork, and chopped 
meats; sifted into cornmeal mush for frying, and oc- 
casionally with cabbage ; string beans or spinach cooked 
with salt pork ; also in bread dressings for pork, beef or 
ham. 

Thyme and Marjoram 

Use with light meats, as turkey, broiled squab, pan- 
cooked chicken and fish ; in bread dressings ; and with 
boiled beans. 

Tarragon 

When fresh, mince and sprinkle on plain salads, or 
sparingly on broiled fish. Use fresh or dry in making 
tarragon vinegar. Use in chicken, fish and veal salads. 

Horseradish 

Use with heavy meats, mixed with a little vinegar and 
sugar, or as a sauce made with stock and crumbs; beat 
into butter and spread on broiled or planked fish ; use in 
sandwiches; add to pickled beets, or beet and cabbage 
salad. Dried horseradish may be freshened and used in 
the same way. 

Mixed Pickle Spice 

Use a teaspoonful in making two quarts of soup stock, 
boiling mutton, fish, corned beef, ham, or tongue, mak- 
ing tomato soup, pickling beets, cauliflower and carrots 
for immediate use. To use, tie loosely in cheesecloth. 

Whole Cloves 

Use in making soup stock, sweet-sour sauces, baked 
carrots, boiled beans, spiced beets, boiling fish, and bak- 
ing ham in cider or grape juice, coddled apples or pears 
and spiced punch. 



72 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Mustard 

Sprinkle sparingly on lettuce to be dressed at the table, 
in mustard sauce, for potatoes, beef and so on; combine 
minced ham and tongue for sandwiches, and add occasion- 
ally to cheese dishes. 

Mace 

Use sparingly with spiced beef, oysters, veal ; in mayon- 
naise for shell-fish, occasionally in sauce tartare, French 
oyster soup, escalloped oysters, sauce for asparagus, po- 
tato croquettes. Use in rich cookies, berry pie and pound 
cake to produce the old-fashioned flavor. 

Nutmeg 

Use very judiciously as the flavor is pronounced ; with 
spinach, mushrooms, or in place of mace. It may be 
combined with pickled beets or carrots, also sweet pota- 
toes ; stuffed baked potatoes, escalloped fish. Grate over 
custard pie, or junkets, use in custards, any apple dish, 
occasionally with cooked peaches or pears, or whenever 
a blend of spices is desired. 

Stick Cinnamon 

Use with pickle spice, in boiling corned, or spiced, 
beef, ham, smoked, or fresh, tongue, occasionally with 
fish, and in making court bouillon. A little is delicious 
with chocolate, either hot or iced, or in chocolate corn 
starch pudding, or chocolate frappe. It combines well 
with boiled apples, escalloped pears, either fresh or dried, 
stewed figs, or prunes. 

Ground Cinnamon 

Use in apple and squash pie, doughnuts, apple rolls, 
Dutch apple cake, in the syrup for basting baked apples, 
currantade, spice cakes, cinnamon toast, cinnamon loaf, 
etc. 

Caraway Seed 

Use with pork sausage; in red cabbage salad, for 
caraway vinegar, in old-time seed cakes, rye and sweet 
breads. 



SEASONINGS 73 

Coriander Seed 

Use in candies ; sparingly sprinkled on cookies ; ground, 
in cakes, sweet rolls or bread. 

Curry 

Use with meats which need livening; as soup meat, 
boiled chicken, sweetbreads, etc., or as a sauce for ham, 
tongue, or fish, or in boiled or mayonnaise dressing, to be 
used with veal, lamb, or vegetables. Serve curried rice, 
or potatoes with m chicken, veal, or lamb, either plain or 
creamed. Curry sauce may be used with quickly-boiled 
cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, or onions. 

Celery Tips 

Use for celery soup, bouillon, in sauce for fowl, for 
creaming oysters, lamb, or chicken, in making chicken 
jelly, boiling veal for loaf ; in potato soup and oyster stew. 

Cheese 

Cheese in various forms may be used to give variety 
in flavoring. The most commonly used with meats, eggs, 
soups and spaghetti is Parmesan, but to be wholly satis- 
factory, this must be bought in bulk form and grated; 
it is also less expensive this way than in bottles. How- 
ever, American cheese may be used to good advantage 
in a similar way. It is a good plan to save all rinds and 
bits of cheese, dry them in a current of air and grate 
them for use as needed. 



CHAPTER VII 

THE EQUIPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE 
KITCHEN 

CHOOSING THE UTENSILS 

The kitchen is a most interesting room, and, in the 
hands of a skilful woman, can be made the most attrac- 
tive in the house. But rest assured that it will not be at- 
tractive arid loved, if, three times a day, it is the scene 
of nerve-racking attempts to cook without adequate tools. 
There are always a certain number of pots and pans that 
are indispensable ; bowls, of various sizes, are needed ; 
wire utensils, others of wood and various other little con- 
veniences; beyond this the list swells towards luxury. 

It is not a good plan to furnish the kitchen in " one 
ware " for the various kinds on the market all have dif- 
ferent uses. If one is buying for durability, a partial 
aluminum equipment is a good investment; this costs 
more than other wares, but seems to wear almost in- 
definitely. It will not break or chip, has no seams or 
joints in which bacteria may collect; any indentures may 
easily be straightened out by light hammering; it is light 
and easily cleaned. For large utensils, like a teakettle, 
stock pot, etc., aluminum is invaluable. However, only 
guaranteed wares should be selected. 

Enamelware of standard quality is always satisfactory, 
but, unfortunately, it is difficult to ascertain the best 
grades, as price is no indication. I purchased a large 
amount of enamelware at a high price, only to find it 
chipping within a month ; later securing a cheaper grade 
which has been in constant use for five years. The safest 
way to buy enamelware is to get one piece and try it 
out by putting some water in it, boiling it up, and then 
dashing it in cold water; if it can stand this vigorous 
treatment you may be sure it is good. This brings up the 
question of " seconds " ; buying them is always a gamble, 

74 



THE EQUIPMENT OF THE KITCHEN 75 

for though unpopular shapes or job lots are often so 
classed, and may give satisfaction, the next lot might 
chip in a minute. 

Although sometimes called " old-fashioned," tinware 
still has a place in the kitchen. Not in the line of pots 
and stew-pans, perhaps, for it has a tendency to discolor 
boiling liquids, but for the dishpan, bread tins, layer, 
sheet, and loaf cakepans. For durability only heavy well- 
tinned ware should be purchased, and, whereas this costs 
more than the thin, stamped variety, it is worth the 
extra expense. Iron, too, still has a usage it is the 
best possible medium for the old-fashioned pot roast 
while an iron skillet, when properly heated, is more satis- 
factory than any other, kinrl An iron frying kettle, that 
fits the stove, is preferable to other types, because it is 
not easily overturned. 

Now that we have finally learned to adopt our grand- 
mother's method of oven cookery, earthenware or glass 
baking utensils are indispensable, not only because they 
develop delicious flavors, and are really time-savers, but 
because they are attractive enough to use as serving 
dishes. The varieties of these articles are innumerable 
pie plates, casseroles, baking dishes, custard cups 
the selection varying with one's pocketbook. However, 
earthenware is sometimes a " delusion and a nare," 
cracking with the first cooking and, like enamelware, 
should be tested. Before using put them to boil up in a 
kettle of cold water, let come slowly to boiling point, then 
cool in the water. If they crack with this process, the 
manufacturers will replace them if they are not " sec- 
onds." It is always advisable to include a few china, 
glass, or earthenware bowls for beating eggs, etc., but 
the mixing bowls should be of enamel or aluminum as 
they are lighter to handle and more durable. In fact, for 
actual practicability, there is no better utensil for mixing 
than a saucepan, because of its handle. 

This brings up a very important point in the purchasing 
of equipment that of making each utensil do the double 
duty of saving space in storing and extra handling, and 
at the same time be durable and adapted to the con- 
venience of each individual housekeeper. 

Glass fruit jars with screw tops, in pint and quart 



76 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

sizes, are excellent for storing supplies, while jelly jars 
with covers are useful for spices, etc. They are also par- 
ticularly good for the ice-box, as they can be covered, 
a glance sufficing to show the amount and condition of 
foods. 

The choice of utensils depends, somewhat, on the 
rest of the furnishings ; for instance, if a kitchen cabinet 
is to be used, it will not be necessary to provide a mould- 
ing board or sugar bucket. 

One should also consider the shape of the utensil; for 
example, food will boil more quickly in a broad and shal- 
low sauce-pan. The edges should be rounded rather than 
angular to permit quick cleansing, and all double boiler 
tops should be provided with handles. 

The following lists, while not cast iron, represent a 
necessary equipment for good work. The luxuries 
a double roasting pan, a steamer, bread mixer, ice-cream 
freezer, etc. may be slowly acquired. One clever 
woman put away, into a jar, twenty-five cents every week, 
from the housekeeping money, towards new utensils. 
Her kitchen became a model of convenience, and with its 
pretty scrim curtains, white paint, pale green walls, red- 
cushioned rocker and shiny utensils, developed into the 

most attractive room in the house.

THE KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 
AND THEIR ARRANGEMENT 

The test of a well-planned kitchen is the amount of in- 
telligent work that can be accomplished in it in the least 
possible time. Is the kitchen too large, therefore, neces- 
sitating much walking to and fro ? Is it located near the 
pantry and storerooms? Where is the refrigerator, or, 
in case no ice is used, where is the cold storage for food ? 
Is the sink of comfortable height ? Are the cooking 
utensils arranged in the best possible position for use? 
Is the lighting good? Is it a cheerful room, or the most 
dingy in the household? These are a few of the ques- 
tions that must be met when a really practicable kitchen 
is to be planned. 

Attractive surroundings have an inspiring effect upon 
any housekeeper and, in spite of her smothered longings 
and bravely unuttered desires,, the possessor of a dingy 
kitchen often longs for a prettier room and, when it is 
realized that the average woman spends fully a third of 
her time in the kitchen, it seems quite as reasonable to 
expend a little money for paint and furnishings for her 
workshop as for a new cement walk or fence, or attrac- 
tive office fixtures for the man of the house. 

Since the wall serves as background for the room the 
finish should be unobtrusive. Whenever possible it will 
be found most satisfactory to paint the walls with a pre- 
pared oil paint rendering them washable with soap and 
water; they can be renewed every other year. For a 
dark kitchen with a northern exposure, a light buff is a 
cheery color, while, in a bright sunny room, a soft green 
will absorb the light and rest the eyes. The wainscot 
and mop-board may be painted in a slightly darker shade 
of the same color, while, if the chairs, table legs and 



THE EQUIPMENT OF THE KITCHEN 79 

wood about the sink are to be done, it is a good plan to 
use a darker shade as it is less liable to show soil. If it 
is necessary to paper the walls, choose a washable paper 
or one with a tiled design in blue and white ; this gives a 
clean appearance, and, if the latter is coated with a white 
varnish, it can be washed as necessary and will last for 
several years. Another good plan is to put on an oil- 
cloth wainscot papering above it. 

The most sanitary finish for the ceiling is plain white- 
wash, because it can be renewed frequently, but, if the 
ceiling is in too bad condition to be left unpapered, the 
whitewash may be used over any light paper. The best 
finish for the kitchen floor is usually dictated by the con- 
dition of the floor itself. When it is old and seamed, 
there are but three solutions first, a plain floor which 
must be scrubbed or mopped ; second, an oiled floor ; third, 
a good floor paint with a coat of hard varnish. If oil is 
to be used good results can be obtained from any stand- 
ard preparation which costs about seventy-five cents a 
gallon. As these oils are usually made of crude paraffine 
with the wax fused into them they will present a hard 
surface rather than the sticky result obtained when boiled 
linseed oil is used. All things considered the best floor 
paint is the old-fashioned floor yellow, either prepared 
with the varnish in it, or with a coat of varnish applied 
after the coat is dry. A good grade of such paint costs 
about two dollars a gallon, but this amount will cover 
approximately four hundred square feet. Two coats 
should be applied. When there are children in the house- 
hold, they will, of necessity, spend much of their 
time in the kitchen with the house-mother. In this case 
the floor should have a linoleum or cork covering to add 
to its warmth. If this is rubbed over occasionally with 
a little floor oil or wax, it will last much longer and will 
be more easily cleaned. Rag, cork or grass rugs should 
be placed before the sink and entry door. 

The question of convenient size for a kitchen is fre- 
quently raised, and whether OF not it should be large or 
small depends on the type of family. However, the ideal 
kitchen is small and compact and should be used only for 
the preparation of the meals. A visit to a Pullman 
kitchen is an eye-opener in regard to compactness and 



8o MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

efficiency. In a small, well-planned kitchen, every inch 
of wall space has literally its use and the time saved in 
preparing the meals in the small space is just as much as 
that which would be spent in walking about a too large 
room in quest of this or that. At the same time a limited 
working space necessitates constant clearing away, thus 
acting as a check upon any tendency to work in a muss 
and proving in the end a real time-saver. 

But everyone cannot have a kitchen which acts only as 
a workshop. If the house-mother has several children 
and does her own work, she will appreciate an ample 
kitchen, well-arranged, because it will be large enough to 
take in the children and their toys without having them 
underfoot. All the cooking apparatus should be together 
as in an invisibly divided room, while the sewing machine, 
the children's play box and a comfortable chair or two 
should be placed on a good-sized rug in another part of 
the room. Whether or not there should be a pantry is an 
open question which depends largely on the size of the 
kitchen. If the room is small, or if it is to act as the 
only sitting room of a maid, a well-planned pantry will 
prove a great convenience. The shelving should be open. 

A kitchen cabinet should be provided, if possible, but if 
it is not, a series of well-placed shelves should be put 
about fifteen inches apart above the cooking table, the low- 
est being wide enough to accommodate the mixing bowls 
and heavy utensils. The shelf above may be used for 
spices and flavorings, cereals and small quantities of meal, 
all of which may be stored in large glass jars. All of 
the receptacles should be labeled, the labels themselves 
being varnished on; measuring cups, spoons, egg-beat- 
ers, etc., may be hung from hooks along the shelves, or 
on the table ends. Both table and shelves should be zinc- 
covered, although oilcloth may be used. A shelf should 
be adjusted beneath the table, about fifteen inches from 
the floor, and, if a cleat is nailed around it, it may be 
used for kettles and other utensils. With this arrange- 
ment it will be possible to accomplish a large amount of 
cookery without leaving the table, except to go to the 
stove. This brings up the greatest disadvantage of 
doing the mixing in the pantry. The stove is, of neces- 
sity, in the kitchen, thus entailing many extra steps.

However, this can be partially overcome if an electric 
plate, or one-burner gas stove, is placed at the right- 
hand end of the cooking table. If this is done, salad 
dressing, custards, many a pudding, vegetable or soup can 
be cooking while other dishes are being prepared on the 
table. It will also be found most inconvenient to have 
the preparation table or a kitchen cabinet in the pantry 
unless the sink also Is placed there. 

Both the cooking table and the sink should be made of 
convenient height for comfortable work without un^ue 
stooping, and a revolving stool that may be adjusted as 
desired, should be provided so that the housekeeper can 
sit during part of the work. If the table is too low, raise 
it by means of blocks of wood. If possible, a porcelain 
sink should be chosen. Needless to say, all the plumbing 
should be open and the utensils used in dish washing, 
together with some ammonia, a scouring soap, steel wool 
and a soapdish attached to the faucets should be grouped 
around the sink. If the sink cannot be adjusted to cor- 
rect height, which varies with the woman, buy a galvan- 
ized iron pan or rack and set the dishpan upon it to raise 
it to correct height. If possible, drain boards or shelves 
should be on each side of the sink, but this is not always 
practicable. 

After scraping and stacking the dishes, they should be 
placed upon a shelf, or, in lieu of that, a wheel tray, at 
the right of the sink. The dishes should be washed and 
placed to drain on a dish dryer at the left of the sink. 
Frequently, the cooking table may be placed at the left 
of the sink, if there is no drain board. 

As far as possible all the cooking dishes should be 
washed up as fast as they accumulate, and, if a woman 
plans right, she will have very few pots and pans to 
wash after the meal is completed. If she is going to have 
company, she will certainly plan an oven or steamer- 
meal to avoid any last-minute cookery. Frequently, the 
cooking dishes, if there are only a few, can be quickly 
washed up before the meal is served. In clearing the 
table the dishes should, as far as possible, be stacked, 
the previous scraping, if done with a rubber dish scraper, 
being but the work of a few moments. The dishes 
should then be washed in the following order: Glass, 



82 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

silver, small china, large china dishes, then the cooking 
utensils, if there are any left. 

The range should be set as near as possible to the cook- 
ing table; again the question of correct height must be 
considered, for there is no better way to prevent back- 
ache than not to have it. In selecting any range, whether 
for wood, coal, or gas, choose one simple in design and 
easy to clean. Whatever the fuel 'used in the winter, 
either gas, electricity or kerosene should be used during 
the summer. Stoves of these types are not expensive, 
and the cost will be retrieved in the fuel saved during 
two summers' use. An adequate fireless cooker is of the 
greatest assistance, whatever the fuel. 

It is not necessary to buy the most expensive ice-box, 
but rather one of convenient size, large enough to con- 
tain a hundred pounds of ice and made narrow so that it 
will fit into any house. There should be few trimmings, 
an ice-box does not belong in the parlor ! The ideal 
refrigerator has a side compartment for ice the cool- 
ing surface being greatly in excess of that where the ice 
is put in top. However, if the former is not available, 
the latter will be much better than none and should have 
side-doors, as this makes it possible for the iceman easily 
to fill the box. If the compartment opens at the top, he 
might drop the ice in and crack or bend the zinc lining. 

Several insulations are used, an air layer, mineral wool 
and charcoal being the most common. Charcoal is used 
in the better refrigerators and furnishes the most cold- 
tight insulation, because it is firmly packed in and cannot 
settle, as does the mineral wool. Any cracks in the lining 
should be repaired at once, lest the moisture work into the 
space. The air-space insulation is used only in the 
cheaper ice-boxes ; whatever the material, it is not giving 
good service unless it keeps the refrigerator at an even 
temperature of forty degrees Fahrenheit, provided the 
ice compartment is kept filled and the doors tightly closed. 
Any refrigerator that contains moist-cold is inadequate, 
as moisture promotes bacterial growth. Try putting 
some matches in your refrigerator for a few days ; if 
they will light on removal, the refrigerator is doing good 
service. 

The inner lining may be of zinc, enamel, porcelain or 



THE EQUIPMENT OF THE KITCHEN 83 

glass. Zinc is used in the cheaper grades, and,' when it 
becomes black, may be covered with two coats of flat 
white and one of bathtub enamel; this is not only easier 
to clean but enables one to see the contents better. Glass 
and porcelain are both excellent linings, but the price may 
be prohibitive to the average person. The shelves should 
be adjustable, and of wire ; no wood, not even under the 
ice-tray, should be used in the interior construction. The 
inner parts should furnish the smallest of lodging places 
for bacteria, as they will get in anyhow and can be con- 
trolled only by the even cold, which retards their growth. 
If possible, the refrigerator should have several compart- 
ments, as this is of great assistance in keeping the foods ; 
butter, cream and milk, for instance, should be kept 
alone. Meats, and all other foods, should be covered, as 
they absorb odors. 

Then there is the question of the drain pipe. In many 
cases it has direct connection with a sewer and is a 
breeder of disease, as germs collect and grow. Better 
use the old-fashioned pan. 

And the question of ice. In the first place be sure it is 
pure for, if taken from contaminated waters, typhoid 
may develop. The ordinary snow ice, containing air bub- 
bles which hold the germs, is especially to be avoided. 
Although, of course, ice is always washed before placing 
in the refrigerator, a piece of cheesecloth laid underneath 
will catch much of the sediment and aid in keeping the 
drain pipe clean. 

It is more economical to replenish with a large piece of 
ice rather than small ones, and it also keeps the box 
cooler. As it hinders radiation the basis of refriger- 
ation the wrapping of ice should always be avoided. 

The range, the sink, the cooking table or kitchen cabi- 
net, the stool and the ice-box, together with a suitable 
place for the receiving of soiled dishes furnish the back- 
bone of the kitchen equipment. To this should be added 
a comfortable rocking chair, if the size of the room war- 
rants it, and a commodious shelf for cook books, recipe 
files and a file of menu cards. A slate put in a con- 
spicuous place should be adopted on which to chart out 
the day's menu, at least three meals in advance, and a 
calendar memorandum card will make short work of the 



84 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

notation of each day's supplies as they come in. It is an 
easy matter to make up the household accounts each week 
from this pad. A good spring scale is a necessity, a 
wheel tray is a great asset, one of the best types being in 
wood-colored finish with two trays ; this can be folded if 
desired, and may be used in any room in the house, as a 
tray for the invalid, tea tray, or even for piazza refresh- 
ments. 

The best place for the dishes is in a small pantry or 
passageway between the kitchen and dining room. 
Needless to say these shelves should be closed in tightly. 
However, all the cooking dishes, bowls, earthenware, 
cooking glass, etc., should be grouped near the cooking 
table. 

No kitchen can be arranged according to set rule. But 
generally speaking the following order should be fol- 
lowed as closely as possible : Both sink and stove should 
be near windows. A shelf or table for stacking soiled 
dishes should be at the right of the sink and a shelf, or 
drain board, at the left. If the room is very small and 
must act as the laundry as well, the preparation table or 
kitchen cabinet may be dispensed with and set-tubs, with 
white enamel tops, may replace it. A group of shelves 
should be placed above the tubs, so that the cooking 
materials may be properly grouped. The ice-box belongs 
at the left of this cooking table. The china shelves 
should be as near the sink as is convenient. A zinc-cov- 
ered shelf, or lightweight zinc-covered, or porcelain 
topped table should be placed beside the stove. If there 
is not room for this, the wheel tray can be called into 
requisition. 

The correct placing of the utensils is a point that de- 
serves emphasis. The knives belong where the paring is 
to be done and may be slipped into leather pockets on the 
wall. The chopping knife belongs near the chopping 
bowl, the cooking spoons at the place where they will be 
needed and not in some obscure drawer. The frying 
pans belong near the stove and should be hung at correct 
height, not stowed away in some cupboard just because 
there happens to be one. In other words, common sense 
must assist in arranging the kitchen and grouping the 
utensils. 



CHAPTER VIII 
RANGES AND THEIR OPEEATION 

The kitchen range is the power plant of the home, and 
as such should be the first article of household equip- 
ment purchased and should be kept in as good condition 
as the piano or the silver. No range, whether for coal, 
kerosene, gas, or electricity, will take care of itself, and 
the housewife should be as familiar with its moods, good 
points and possible bad points as a pianist is familiar with 
the black and white keys of the piano. 

THE COAL RANGE 

An adequate coal range must cook steadily, bake 
evenly, and broil unsmellingly and do it without con- 
suming its weight in coal every day! It should be eco- 
nomical of fuel, bake evenly all over the oven, simple and 
easy to operate, durable and very plain, so that it may 
be cleaned easily. To be truly economical a range should 
demand the use of but two hods of coal a day and as the 
weather grows warm of even less, provided, of course, 
that the housewife understands its operation. 

The fire-box should be in proportion to the size of the 
range, so that an unnecessary amount of coal will not be 
consumed, as is the case when it is too large, and so that 
the heat may be delivered where it belongs, which cannot 
be done if it is too small. The sides should be perpen- 
dicular so that ashes will not lodge against the fire-brick. 
The grate bars should be durable, but should not be so 
heavy that the supply of air which reaches the fire 
through them is insufficient. On the other hand, if they 
are too light, they will warp quickly. The side draft 
should open below the grate bars into the chamber 
between the ash pan and grate, so that the air will be 
made warm before it strikes the burning coals ; therefore 
causing them to burn out instead of dying out, thus 
affecting a considerable economy in fuel. 

The surface of the range should be plain and smooth, 

8s 



86 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

and there should be comparatively little nickel trimming. 
A polished steel top, which may be washed instead of 
blackened, can be obtained with any range for about three 
dollars extra. This insures a clean cooking surface; 
means fewer black-bottomed cooking utensils to wash, 
and as it takes about fifteen minutes to polish the top of 
the range, it will effect considerable saving of time during 
the year. Too much cannot be said about the necessity 
of keeping the range bright and shining, for it is truly the 
heart of the kitchen. 

In case a home is not permanent, a leg range will prove 
to be the best purchase, as it is more easily moved than 
one of the cabinet type; whichever is chosen, a good- 
sized zinc square should be placed underneath it to catch 
possible drippings of fat, and so on. 

In purchasing a range, always ascertain first whether 
or not the stove is insulated, so that the heat will be 
reflected against the surfaces where it is desired ; in other 
words, retained in the range rather than unduly thrown 
'off into the kitchen. Be sure that the oven is large 
enough and, if possible, select a range that has a drop 
door rather than one of the hinge type. Be sure that 
there is an adequate supply of heat flowing around the 
oven, as otherwise it will not " bake well." The dampers 
must fit tight in order adequately to control the fire. 
Cheaply constructed ranges will frequently have loose- 
fitting dampers to prevent pinching or binding at the 
rough edges. The stove should be constructed so that 
broiling can be conducted directly over the live coals 
rather than over a lid on the top of the .stove, so that the 
smoke may be carried up the chimney. 

The problem of the ashes and their removal is one of 
the greatest with which the housewife has to contend in 
kitchen cleanliness. If the range is being installed per- 
manently in a home, it will be an untold convenience to 
have an ash chute put into the range, whereby the ashes 
are conducted directly to the basement. This is, perhaps, 
expensive, but will pay in the end, over and over again. 
In emptying the ashes from the ordinary range, it will be 
found that they will not fly if they are thoroughly 
dampened, and, if the ash pan is emptied faithfully every 
day, very little muss will result. 



RANGES AND THEIR OPERATION 87 

To Build a Fire and Operate the Coal Range. Close 
all. the dampers, except the oven dampers; remove the 
covers from the top of the stove and brush the soot and 
ashes into the fire-box. Turn over the grate in order to 
dump the ashes into the ash pan. Scrape off anything 
which has been spilled on the bottom of the oven. Put a 
very thin layer of coal on the bottom of the fire-box, 
leaving plenty of air spaces between the pieces. On this 
put a layer of crumpled newspaper or shavings, filling the 
fire-box about one-third full. On this lay, crosswise, 
pieces of kindling, being sure that they reach the corners. 
Take care that the fuel is arranged loosely in order to 
allow free passage of the air. Light the fire by applying 
a lighted match between the bars of the grate to the 
paper or shavings. When the wood is burning well, add 
two shovelfuls of coal, not too large, and, when that has 
burned, add more coal. By this method the coal ignites 
both below and above the wood, and a thicker fire-bed is 
obtained in a shorter time than by the usual method. If 
the stove is to be blackened, it should be done as soon as 
the fire is lighted. 

When the fire is well started, close the oven dampers 
and half close the lower damper, and, when it is burning 
well, the lower damper may be entirely closed and the 
chimney damper half closed. 

For an even hot fire, be sure that all the ashes are 
shaken out, and keep the fire-box three-fourths full of 
coal. The lower front and chimney dampers should be 
opened, but the oven and check dampers should be 
closed. When the coal is beginning to ignite, the 
dampers should be closed. Such a fire is of the type that 
is used for ironing, and is good for two or three hours 
without the addition of more coal. If the irons are put. 
on to heat while the fire is getting into this condition, 
considerable time may be saved. 

To direct the heat to the oven, the oven and chimney 
dampers should be opened and the others closed, but to 
get good results from the oven, no matter how expensive 
the range may be, it must be cleaned frequently on top 
and undernea'th. If there is a vacuum cleaner in the 
house, it can be used for this purpose, as well as for the 
stove-pipe. 



88 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

As different stoves have different dampers, it is impos- 
sible to give special directions for the management of a 
fire that can be used with any range. However, a gen- 
eral rule is to open all the dampers when building a fire 
and to close the oven damper when the coal is burning: 
well. 

To check the fire somewhat, open the slide in the 
check damper; and to cool it quickly, open the check 
damper itself, keeping the other dampers closed. 

In very cold weather and to save time, it is a good plan 
to keep the fire over night, although this necessitates the 
use of a little more fuel than is needed when the fire is 
built fresh every morning. To do this, the fire-box 
should be filled with coal; the check damper should be 
opened, and the other dampers closed. In the morning, 
the fire should be shaken down thoroughly and fresh coal 
added a little at a time. 

Like everything else, the stove will do better work if 
the fire is rested occasionally. For instance, if baking is 
to be done at supper time, close all the dampers after hav- 
ing built up a good fire after dinner, and leave them closed 
until about half an hour before time to put the food into 
the oven. 

GAS AND COMBINATION RANGES 

When it is necessary to heat the kitchen during the 
cold months by means of the coal range, the best possible 
purchase is a combination coal and gas range. These 
come equipped for either natural or artificial gas. How- 
ever, as it is somewhat easier to cook with gas, it is a 
good plan to select a combination range that consists of a 
gas stove with a coal heater attachment. This can be 
run on a hod of coal for a day and a night, and can be 
equipped with a water-front. This coal attachment is 
approximately the size of a laundry stove, and can be 
used for boiling clothes, heating fiatirons, cooking vege- 
tables, and carrying on the various cooking processes 
which are adapted to the top of the stove. The gas 
equipment can be used for all quick work, baking, and 
during the summer when the saving of heat is an item. 
This type of range is usually equipped with a gas kindler, 
which insures the quick ignition of coal. 



RANGES AND THEIR OPERATION 89 

The combination range, which burns both natural gas 
and coal, is frequently equipped with a general oven, 
which can be used with either fuel. Care, however, must 
be taken in selecting a range of this type to be sure that 
it will give adequate service. This type is especially good 
for use in severe weather when natural gas fluctuates. 

No matter what kind of a range is being selected, it 
should be of good cooking height, so that the housewife 
will not have to bend over unduly while doing her work. 
Gas and electric ranges, which are of the newer school, 
can be found in many makes of the right height, but coal 
ranges, unfortunately, are more usually made low, prob- 
ably because they always have been ! In selecting a gas 
range, purchase one that has a high oven and drop oven 
doors, the oven preferably being finished with aluminized 
paint. There are two or three types of ranges on the 
market which have a direct heat action, so that the food 
can be put into a cold oven, thereby effecting considerable 
gas saving. Most of the better ranges come equipped 
with self-lighters, but if this is not provided with the 
range, it can be put on for $2.50 extra. There should be 
no waste space, no excess trimming to clean, and the 
burners should be of a type that are easily cleaned. 

Like the coal range, it needs daily attention. All food 
that is spilled should be cleaned off at once, the oven kept 
clean, the airholes free, while the zinc plate underneath 
the top burners needs daily attention. If the range is 
rubbed off occasionally with a suitable oil, it will not 
rust, or " liquid veneer " may be rubbed on weekly to keep 
it clean and shiny. Blacking and stove enamel are not 
satisfactory for use on the gas range. The oven will 
not rust if the door is left open while the oven is cooling. 
If a solid top is provided, it should be of polished steel 
for sanitary reasons. Combination gas ranges and fire- 
less cookers are on the market ; some of them give excel- 
lent service, but care should be taken to select one of un- 
doubted repute, as the cheaper type is not always depend- 
able. 

Operating the Gas Stove. The amount of the gas bill 
depends upon the thoughtfulness and common sense of 
the cook and the brains of the woman who plans the 
meals. Gas, rightly used, is the most cleanly and eco- 



90 MRS. .ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

nomical of fuels ; when used without intelligence, it is one 
of the most expensive. 

The oven should not be lighted until the food is nearly 
ready to be put into it, eight minutes with two burners 
is usually sufficient to make it very hot, five or six will 
give a medium heat. When roasting meat, the economi- 
cal housewife will plan to cook her potatoes and pudding 
in the same oven, or better still will roast her meat in the 
broiler, and have all the oven space for other foods. 
Or if she is to have a broiled steak for dinner, she will 
take advantage of the hot oven above to cook a shortcake 
or bake her biscuits. Vegetables are delicious when baked 
and can often be cooked at the same time with the pie or 
cake or baked apples. In other words, she will take 
advantage of all the heat, not allowing any to be wasted. 

When " boiling " meat, as it is usually termed, the ket- 
tle should be placed over the " simmerer " or small 
burner, where it will remain at the right temperature and 
cook slowly if potatoes are boiling, advantage can be 
taken of the steam, a colander set over the kettle and 
some other vegetables or dessert cooked by the steam that 
is usually wasted. 

If the family is small, it will be found a great economy 
to purchase a set of triple utensils (three separate parts 
which fit together), which can be put over one gas burner. 
By this means three articles can be cooked at once by the 
same amount of heat, a saving of labor and fuel. A 
steam cooker of square design can be obtained with sev- 
eral shelves. In one of these, with the use of one burner 
to heat the water, can be cooked a pot roast, vegetables, 
potatoes, pudding and brown bread for a family of six, 
all at the same time! 

Double boilers and all kettles should be shallow, with 
broad bottom, so that the foods may be quickly heated. 
A standard toaster should be purchased, so that it will 
not be necessary to heat the broiling oven to make a slice 
of toast, and a sheet iron plate, to set over a burner, will 
be found a great convenience in heating flat-irons as well 
as cooking. By using such a plate the heat is diffused 
over a wider space, and instead of keeping two irons hot, 
three or four can be heated on it by the same amount of 
gas. 



RANGES AND THEIR OPERATION 91 

For the housekeeper using a gas plate, a perforated 
iron disc, with cover fitting over it, furnishes an adequate 
oven for a small family. A pan of biscuits, baked apples 
or potatoes, and the finishing of an omelet are among its 
possibilities. 

KEROSENE RANGES 

Whether or not gas or electricity may be obtained, the 
housewife need not use the coal range, unless she wishes 
to do so, for several excellent kerosene ranges are on the 
market, which are economical of operation, clean and 
quick. Each has its own method of operation, but the 
general principles of cookery applied to the gas range 
may be used in the operation of the kerosene stove, such 
as oven and steamer meals and the like. 

COOKING BY ELECTRICITY 

There are two styles of electric ranges: the cabinet 
type and the single oven type. In the former the oven 
is elevated to a comfortable working height; in the latter 
the oven is low, necessitating stooping. If there is plenty 
of room in the kitchen the cabinet range will prove the 
best selection, but when space is limited, as in small 
apartments, the single oven type can be used; moreover 
this type of range is somewhat less expensive. 

There are two kinds of electric range units, or heaters, 
the open coil unit, or radiating type and the enclosed coil 
unit, or contact type. 

In the former, the cooking units, or hot plates, or as 
they are sometimes called, lids, disc heaters, or elements, 
are exposed in such way that the time necessary to bring 
them to cooking heat is only about three and a half 
minutes. At the same time they are rather hard to clean 
and great care must be taken that foods do not boil over 
upon them or that grease is not spilled in the units, be- 
cause it is difficult to clean them thoroughly without in- 
jury. In the second type of range, the heating units are 
enclosed, the top of the range being like that of the ordi- 
nary coal range in appearance, with discs, or lids, which 
may be lifted for cleaning as needs be. Because of this 
covering it takes a little longer to bring the units to the 
cooking point, approximately four and a half to five 



92 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

minutes. On the other hand, the solid top retains the 
heat and the amount of current needed to carry on the 
cooking is less than in the open coil unit, and therefore 
equalizes the extra time needed in bringing the units to 
cooking heat over the three minutes necessitated by the 
open coil units. 

Notwithstanding extra care the open coil unit is liable 
to oxidize, or rust, necessitating an occasional renewal of 
units after four or five years' use. On the other hand, 
the enclosed coil unit cannot oxidize or rust so rapidly as 
the open coil, and therefore has longer life. Electric 
ranges equipped with the open coil units are less expen- 
sive than those of the enclosed coil units, so in the end, 
notwithstanding a possible renewal of units, if the open 
coil type is purchased, the cost will be approximately the 
same. 

Every electric range should be provided with a broiler 
pan that fits the oven, preferably of enamel, for if the 
broiler pan does not fit in the oven cleats, the pan may be 
chipped and the oven dented, should the pan happen to be 
put in carelessly. In every oven there should be a shelf 
equipped with a baffle plate of sheet metal, placed directly 
over the bottom heat unit, to insure an even distribution 
of heat In selecting an electric range the following 
points should be carefully noted 

The oven should have rounded corners and be ade- 
quately ventilated and equipped with a drop door. 

The range should be of comfortable cooking height, 
the selection varying from thirty-one to thirty-five inches. 

There should be no waste space. 

The oven should be easy to clean and free from cracks. 

There should be no parts left unfinished, because of the 
liability of rusting and the difficulty of cleaning. 

The range should be finished complete in japan, with 
nickel trimming and white splashers, which act as danger 
signals for dirt. 

The electric range needs as much care as a range of 
any other type/ All water should be wiped off as soon 
as it is spilled. Grease should be immediately cleaned 
off, and there should be waged a constant war on rust. 
The oven should be refinished every six months with 
aluminized paint, which anyone can apply. This may be 



RANGES AND THEIR OPERATION 93 

obtained from any hardware store, where full directions 
for its use will be given. 

The electric range has several distinct advantages over 
the coal and gas types. It is absolutely accurate, and, 
when once established, the cooking time never varies. A 
loaf of bread that will bake in fifty minutes to-day will 
bake in exactly the same time to-morrow, provided the 
current is managed in the same way. In order to give 
the units time to come to cooking heat, it is necessary to 
think ahead a little more when using an electric range. 
It will take an oven from thirty to forty minutes to reach 
baking temperature, and because of this slowness, it is 
not possible to put many foods into the cold oven, as can 
be done in many gas ranges. 

The oven which is insulated to retain heat makes pos- 
sible many economies. , After once being heated, it can be 
kept hot with a small amount of current, just enough to 
supply the heat lost by radiation, and advantage can be 
taken of all the latent heat, even after the current is 
turned off, in the drying of bread crusts, parsley, celery 
tips, etc. It is an interesting fact that the shrinkage of 
meat in the electric oven is less than when either gas or 
coal is used, probably because the meat is seared over 
more quickly on account of the direct top heat, and there- 
fore the juices are retained in greater amount. Also, the 
electric oven furnishes the cleanest heat, for because of 
the ventilator no fumes collect and there is, of course, no 
danger of tainting the food as there is with coal, or ordi- 
nary gas. Probably the point that appeals to most 
women about the electric range is that there is prac- 
tically no heat coming from it, so that the kitchen does 
not become over-heated. This is true, not only with the 
oven, but with the top of the range with regard to the 
heat units. At the same time there is no dust, dirt, 
burned matches, and rare possibility of fire. Certainly 
there is no danger of the baby's being burned ! 

The cost of operation depends entirely upon the cook- 
ing rate for current in the city where the range is used. 
Careful figures show that the average family will con- 
sume approximately 125 killowatts per month. At the 
present writing over 3,500 central stations or electric 
light companies, are giving a cooking rate of five cents or 



94 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

less per killowatt hour to their customers. The cost of 
operation, as with any range, depends largely on the care- 
fulness of the housewife. If care is taken to reduce the 
current when possible, to take advantage of latent heat, 
and to turn off the current as soon as the cooking is fin- 
ished, the cost of operating, when current sells for two 
cents per killowatt hour, will be aproximately the same 
as gas, when the latter sells for ninety cents per thousand 
cubic feet, or coal when the latter sells at from $7.50 to 
$9.00 per ton. 

As with the gas or coal range, the utensils have con- 
siderable to do with the economical running of the elec- 
tric range. Aluminum furnishes the quickest medium of 
transferring heat. A clover-leaf (or triple) utensil, 
whereby three foods can be prepared at one time, over 
one unit ; an adequate steamer, flat-bottomed utensils and 
a goodly equipment of casseroles and oven dishes will be 
found great conveniences. Methods for steaming and 
for preparing meals in the oven are given in the chapter, 
the Short-Cut Preparation of Meals, and may be applied 
to the electric range as well as to that of any other type. 

Some ranges are equipped with automatic cooking at- 
tachments for turning on and off the current. These 
have a certain appeal and work for a limited time, but 
they are liable to get out of order. 

The average housewife is confused by the terms used 
by the " trade." A little study of the following defini- 
tions of terms frequently used in connection with the 
sale, operation and demonstration of the range will pre- 
vent confusion. 

Unit. The name given to the electric heater used 
.either in the oven or on the cooking top. It is sometimes 
called " the hot plate," " disc," " element," etc. 

Switches. The controlling mediums by which the 
units are turned on or off. 

Fuses. The protecting plugs located near the con- 
trolling switches. These are so constructed that any ex- 
cess current or abnormal condition will cause them to cut 
off the current' automatically. In other words, they are 
an automatic safeguard. 

Main Switch. The heavy or large switch installed in 
the wire leading to the range. 



RANGES AND THEIR OPERATION 95 

Pilot Light. An indicating lamp that burns only when 
the current is on; usually placed at or near the main 
switch. 

Socket. A term applied to a lamp socket, or outlet, on 
the side of the range, to which may be attached an electric 
iron, toaster, or any auxiliary apparatus. 

Lead Wires. Two or three wires projecting from a 
part of the body of the range to which the main entrance 
wires are attached. 

Service. A general term applied to meters, switches 
and wiring installed by the central station. 

Killowatt Hour. The number, of watts (measures of 
current) consumed by an electric heater during an hour. 
All rates are figured on the killowatt hours consumed, 
just as gas is figured on the cubic foot. 

Terminals. Equipment for connecting heating units to 
wires terminals come in two forms and are called plugs 
or connections. 



CHAPTER IX 
THE SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 

A great deal has been said and written about efficiency 
in the household, waste motions and a useless expendi- 
ture of energy, but, whereas women are willing to do the 
housework in quicker time, the number of hours which 
are being spent in actual cookery are not greatly lessened 
and, in many instances, have really increased along with 
the taste of the public for greater variety and more 
elaborate meals. 

There are several reasons why an undue amount of 
time is spent in the kitchen. One is because the majority 
of women do not understand the methods and general 
proportions upon which all recipes are based, and, having 
little fundamental knowledge, their work lacks freedom 
and ease ; a second reason is because most housewives fail 
to plan out their meals for at least a day or two ahead. 
This planning is absolutely necessary, as, otherwise, there 
is a frequent repetition of the same cooking process dur- 
ing the day, duplicate dishwashing and a double amount 
of fuel is used. It may not seem possible to plan out the 
meals in advance ; properly speaking it is better to sched- 
ule them for even a week ahead, leaving luncheon or sup- 
per blank to allow for the utilization of left-overs. This 
week's schedule can be posted in the kitchen, or may be 
kept on file at the desk; the meals for each day being 
copied off on the kitchen slate. 

This planning ahead makes possible systematic market- 
ing twice a week, or, in case one lives a long distance from 
the market, once a week. It saves the daily annoyance 
of grocer, butcher and vegetable man, clears the mind of 
the unnecessary details which confuse most women, and 
makes possible a more economical spending of the house- 
hold allowance. At the same time it is possible to tell 
at a glance just what supplies one needs, for instance, 

96 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 97' 

from the vegetable cellar, or the storeroom, one trip suf- 
ficing to get together the vegetables or other food for 
several meals, while a glance is sufficient to show exactly 
what foods of like nature are to be prepared for three 
meals at a time, thereby making possible the saving of 
cooking processes. 

The following table shows the best way in which to 
work out the weekly planning of meals. By arranging 
the meals in columns any duplicate foods and flavors are 
instantly noted, for mistakes have a way of staring out at 
one, when put down in black and white. 

If I were to give any specific rule for the use of left- 
overs, I should say control them; for instance, if rice is 
being cooked, plan to prepare enough so that there will 
be an ample supply left over for rice cakes for the next 
day; steam enough potatoes at one time for two meals; 
cook enough macaroni for one day's luncheon, and for 
the next day's dinner soup, and the like. These instances 
may be multiplied indefinitely. 

But it is not necessary to confine this combining of 
processes to left-overs ; there are many foods that can be 
made in quantity, which will keep for some time, thus 
obviating the constant repetition of the cooking process. 
Good examples of these are mayonnaise, boiled and 
French salad dressings ; pie crust for two or three bak- 
ings ; baked pastry shells enough for two or three weeks ; 
several loaves of fruit cake and so on. 

The accomplishment of quick work is somewhat a mat- 
ter of environment, for upon the general orderliness of 
the room depends the ability of the brain to think rapidly 
and to good purpose. No matter how hurried one may be 
there is no excuse for working in a clutter. The best 
possible method is to wash up the cooking dishes as fast 
as they are used, being careful not to duplicate utensils 
unless absolutely necessary; stack up the dishes, do not 
heap them in the sink, which means that they will have 
to be taken out again before washing. Learn to do two 
or three articles at a time, planning the work so that the 
same utensil may be used over without washing. For 
instance, a double boiler could be used for heating milk 
for junket, for making custard, and then for boiled salad 
dressing, without being washed. It takes brain to think

ahead in this way, but it is planning of this sort that helps 
to relieve the monotony of housework. 

Before commencing to prepare any dish, be sure that 
all the ingredients are at hand ; then read the recipe 
through to the end, because the way a dish is combined 
has a marked influence on the result. If a cake is being 
made, prepare the pan, stand the shortening to soften 
and in the meantime get together the remaining ingre- 
dients, making one trip to the ice-box for milk, eggs 
and butter, then sit down and quickly put the cake to- 
gether. If by any chance the kitchen is inconveniently 
arranged, collect the ingredients together on a tray and 
put them within easy reach of the working table. Sift 
enough flour for the different dishes at once ; if several 
are being made, prepare all the pans together at the same 
time, and, by the way, cut out, in some spare moments, 
enough cake-pan linings and little squares of paper for 
oiling pans to last for weeks. 

Try to prepare foods which may, as far as possible, 
have the same cooking medium. If brown bread is to be 
steamed, the rest of the dinner should be steamed along 
with it. If a casserole is to be made, do the rest of the 
cooking for the meal in the same oven. If the fireless 
cooker is at work, use it to the limit. 

One of the greatest difficulties of most young house- 
wives is how to prepare the various dishes for a meal so 
that they will all be done at the same and proper time. 
One long-suffering young husband confided to me that it 
took five hours for them to eat their first dinner, there 
were such long waits between the courses ! The meal 
should be planned so that there are not more than one 
or two dishes calling for a great deal of preparation in 
each menu. When the meal is planned, sit down and 
think out the dish which it will take the longest time to 
cook, get that started and then take the other dishes in 
rotation, remembering to allow time enough for cold 
dishes to become thoroughly chilled. Find out just how 
long it will take to set the table, and plan between the 
processes to do "this so accurately that nothing will be 
forgotten. 

The best time to prepare the evening dinner is largely 
in the morning when it is necessary to be in and out of 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 101 

the kitchen, and the time to start the luncheon is while 
clearing away the breakfast. It may not seem possible 
to carry on so many things at once, and, at first, the 
young housekeeper will find it difficult, but it is only by 
learning to do several things at a time, dove-tailing them 
together, that she can learn to accomplish a great deal in 
a given time. No woman should be a slave to her work 
and yet every man has the right to come home to a dainty, 
rested and attractive wife. The only way in which this 
can be done is by planning the meals ahead and by sys- 
tematic work. % 

PRINCIPLES OF FIRELESS COOKING 

Whatever the type of cooker, there are several under- 
lying principles which must always be heeded in the 
carrying on of successful fireless cookery: First, all 
utensils to be used for boiling, pot roasting or stewing 
must be equipped with tightly fitting covers. Second, 
any food to be boiled must be cooked for at least ten 
minutes before putting into the cooker. Third, if 
radiators are not used the food must be placed in the 
cooker while still boiling. Fourth, the cooker must be 
thoroughly cleansed with soap and water, and dried and 
aired before each cooking process, as, otherwise, the 
odors of stale food will affect the cooked product. Sixth, 
when two radiators are used the length of time to be 
allowed is the same for baking as in a coal range ; for 
pot-roasting or braising a trifle longer. Seventh, without 
the radiators the time for boiling, simmering or stewing 
is doubled. 

Eighth, foods to be cooked without radiators should be 
in quantities of at least two quarts, to make possible the 
retention of heat, otherwise a vessel of boiling water 
should be put in the cooker at the same time to form the 
necessary amount of heat. 

The Possible Saving of Fuel. The question is often 
asked whether or not the fireless cooker is really practi- 
cal. If intelligently used, there can be no doubt about it. 
From the standpoint of economy in money the saving is 
considerable, especially when used to supplement a gas 
or oil range. When gas is eighty cents per thousand 
cubic feet, for instance, the maximum costs per hour for 



102 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

operating the burners are as follows : a large top burner, 
i]/2 cents; a small top burner, i l /z cents; the oven, 3 cents 
a burner, or 6 cents when both are used, A good sized 
pot roast should be cooked on a range from five to six 
hours. The cost, with the burner reduced almost half, 
would be from three to four cents. If prepared in the 
cooker, the cost is reduced to the length of time it takes 
to heat the radiators. It takes about three cents worth 
of gas to make medium-sized loaves of bread, yet they 
can be done in the cooker with no further expenditure 
than the Cheating of the radiators. Boiled cabbage with 
salt pork is a cheap dish when the ingredients are con- 
sidered, but it becomes decidedly more expensive when 
the cost of the oil or gas is taken into account. The 
same is true of casserole dishes, baked beans, coddled 
apples, old-fashioned baked peaches and apple sauce, or 
stewed dried fruits and vegetables. 

The cost, then, of cooking by the tireless simmers down 
to the length of time needed to heat the radiators and to 
carry on any preliminary preparation. The following 
table is adapted to gas range heat, but in using oil, alcohol, 
coal or wood equally good results may be obtained by in- 
creasing about one-half the length of time for heating the 
radiators. The most accurate method for testing the 
heat of the radiators is by a fireless thermometer, but, if 
one is not at hand, a little flour sprinkled on the stones 
will give the approximate heat. 

Time Table for Heating Radiators 

Boiling 12 minutes, flour pale tan color, thermometer 250. 

Radiators of this temperature should be used for boiling cereals, 
meats, fish, vegetables and fruits. 

Slow baking, or faster boiling 

... 15 minutes, flour light brown, thermometer 325 to 350. 
Suitable for casseroles, macaroni and cheese, escalloped cab- 
bage, sponge cake, fruit cake, steamed puddings, etc. 
Quick baking. .18 minutes, flour brown, thermometer 375 to 400. 
Suitable for bread, loaf cakes, baked potatoes, and other baked 

vegetables, baked beans, biscuits, fish, meat loaves, etc. 
Roasting. .20 minutes, flour dark brown, thermometer 425 to 450. 
Suitable for roasting all kincfs of meat. 

When two radiators are to be used, the most econom- 
ical way to heat them is to place one on top of the other, 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 103 

reversing their positions twice during the heating process. 
It takes half as long again as is necessary to heat one 
stone. In case the article to be cooked is to be brought to 
boiling point, the best way to do it is to place it on top of 
a heating stone, so that the one burner will accomplish 
both objects. The heating stones may be used to keep 
things hot for dinner when a hot closet is not available, 
and many a food which must be re-heated to insure keep- 
ing, as soup stock, may be done at this time. In camps 
and summer cottages the fuel used in heating the stones 
may do double duty in heating water for dishes, a bit of 
washing, or the baby's bath. 

CHOOSING FIRELESS UTENSILS 

As in all types of cooking the choice of utensils has 
much to do with success. The best results are obtained 
by the use of aluminum and glass. In all cases where 
boiling is carried on the covers must fit tight; the triple 
utensil is indispensable, for it makes possible the cookery 
of three things at a time with one radiator. For baked 
beans, escallops and casserole dishes the covered glass 
casseroles are invaluable. At the same time still more 
dish washing is avoided. If the saving of money is no 
object, economy of time appeals to most women, while to 
others a cool kitchen is of paramount importance. It is 
possible absolutely to control the heat in the cooker so that, 
when anything is put in, one need not fear that it will 
burn, provided it is left the right length of time. Foods 
that are boiled, stewed or braised will not be harmed by a 
little over-cooking, but foods that are baked, as bread, cake 
and the like, must be removed at the end of the necessary 
time, or they will burn, for the fireless cooker, when used 
with the heated radiators, is merely the old Dutch oven 
brought up to date. If the general principles of range 
cookery are understood, a few attempts will suffice to 
give the actual time needed in cooking various foods. 

HOW TO USE THE COOKER 

The following points, however, may prove helpful to 
the inexperienced. The obvious way to cook cereals is 
over night. They should be brought to the boiling point, 
boiled fifteen minutes, and put into the cooker together 



104 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

with a vessel of boiling water, boiling prunes, figs, apple 
sauce, or any other food which demands all-night cook- 
ery. No radiators are needed. In cooking tough meats, 
as fowl, rolled flank and the like, better results are 
gained by using one radiator at 250 and cooking over 
night; or for day cooking allow six to seven hours with 
the radiator heated to 325. Allow four hours for boil- 
ing steamed pudding or breads, in quart-sized moulds ; 
two hours for pint moulds. In this case the pudding 
moulds should be set into the utensil, half-filled with 
cold water, brought slowly to boiling point and boiled 
for ten minutes, before putting into the cooker. Allow 
one hour, with two radiators, for baking potatoes, an 
hour and a half for cooking onions or turnips or cabbage, 
fifteen minutes to the pound with two radiators for roast- 
ing beef or lamb, and twenty minutes to the pound for 
pork and veal. For soup stock, stews, corned beef and 
pot roasts of any desired meats, allow from five to six 
hours. One hour is sufficient to bake three-quarter- 
pound loaves of bread, twenty-five minutes for biscuits, 
from fifty minutes to an hour for a medium-sized loaf of 
cake, and the same length of time as is allowed in the 
oven should be given to pies. 

If a very large loaf of cake is to be baked, better re- 
sults will be obtained if the second stone is not put in 
place for fifteen minutes after the cake is started. All 
articles to be baked or boiled must be set upon a wire 
trivet, rather than upon the stone itself, to prevent lia- 
bility of scorching. 4 

The fireless cooker is just as capable of retaining cold 
as it is heat. To this end it is invaluable for the freezing 
of mousses or parfaits that is ices which can be pre- 
pared without stirring. To a quart mould of mousse, 
four pounds of cracked ice and an equal amount of salt 
should be added. Once packed in a fireless utensil and 
put in the cooker, it may be entirely forgotten till serv- 
ing time, as there will be no necessity for repacking. 
About four pounds less ice is needed when the fireless is 
used. It may also be used to equal advantage for pack- 
ing cream that is to be moulded or even kept over night. 

There is no doubt but that too much magic has been 
ascribed to the fireless cooker, for there are times when 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 105 

it is much more convenient and quite as inexpensive to 
cook by the ordinary methods. It is often said, for in- 
stance, that the whole meal can be put in to cook and that 
the housewife can leave for an afternoon of shopping or 
pleasure and will find her dinner ready on her return. 
This can be done only if foods suited to this kind of 
cookery are used, and they must be grouped according to 
the length of time it takes the " longest " one to cook. To 
illustrate : It would not be possible to put in a pot roast of 
beef, potatoes and peas at the same time, for the potatoes 
and peas would be sadly over-cooked by the time the meat 
was done. In this case cabbage, cooked by a method de- 
manding long cookery, could be served as a vegetable, the 
potatoes would have to be fried at the last minute, or re- 
heated in some other way, rather than being prepared in 
the cooker, and the dessert could be a pudding, as steamed 
whole wheat, with dates, demanding about five hours' 
steaming. 

It is not necessary to have a separate list of recipes for 
fireless cooking. All casseroles, stews, soups, all vege- 
tables needing long-stewing or baking, all fruits, both 
dried and fresh, needing long cooking, all cereals, all 
braised and boiled meats, or fish, and all steamed breads 
or puddings are well adapted to this method. 

CASSEROLE COOKING 

Most American housewives understand too little about 
the possibilities of cooking in the oven. The mind turns 
instantly to the casserole and the tougher cuts of meat, 
but these by no means exhaust the resources of the oven. 
There is no better way to make a chicken or other tender 
meat " go far " than en casserole ; there is no more de- 
licious way to cook fish, game, both dried and fresh 
vegetables, puddings, many cereals, and dried and fresh 
fruits, than in the oven. 

Utensils 

There are many utensils adapted to oven cookery, the 
most familiar being those of earthenware, which can be 
obtained for almost any price, and in many desirable 
shapes and sizes. If these are plunged into a kettle of 
cold water, brought slowly to the boil, and then boiled for 



io6 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

five minutes before using, they will give good service; 
otherwise, they are apt to crack. The old-time Boston 
bean pot is an excellent utensil for cooking meats which 
are cut 'in comparatively small pieces, as well as fruits 
and dried vegetables, while the old-fashioned blue-and- 
white stew-pot, which can be obtained in almost any size, 
is especially suitable for use in large families, and is in- 
expensive. Attractive utensils of this kind are made of 
the new cooking glass; they are durable and very prac- 
tical. At the same time they are the most easily cleaned 
of all oven- ware and the cooking can be carried on in a 
fourth less time than usual. 

Whereas it is necessary to use a covered casserole for 
all long processes, various open dishes are especially 
adapted to' the cookery of quickly-prepared foods. An 
earthen or glass baking platter, for instance, makes pos- 
sible the preparation, without odor, of fish and many 
meats and vegetables ; nor do they need special attention 
after they are in the oven. As the food should be served 
in the dish in which it is cooked, this is a real saving in 
dish washing. The ramekin, little sister of the casserole, 
is not only inexpensive, but is particularly useful for indi- 
vidual service, not only of savory dishes and vegetables, 
but of desserts. The family may tire, for example, of 
creamed corn, but if it is combined with a little left-over 
veal or chicken, well-seasoned, strewed with bread crumbs, 
and served en ramekin, it becomes a ",new dish." The 
youngsters may often rebel at such a plebeian dessert as 
bread pudding, but if prepared in ramekins with a little 
meringue, topped with currant jelly, it becomes " some- 
thing new." 

Time of Cookery 

Most women seem to think that casserole cooking 
necessitates a great deal of trouble in preparation, and a 
long time in the oven. The time consumed depends en- 
tirely upon the article of food. Boston baked beans, for 
example, take about eight hours in a very slow oven ; a 
three-and-a-half-pound chicken, cut as for fricassee, takes 
about an hour and a half in a moderate oven, but it needs 
no attention while cooking, and when it is removed is 
ready to be put on the table. If a coal stove is used, the 
oven is ready for a casserole dish at almost any time of 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 107 

the day. If gas, electricity or kerosene is burned, the 
oven can be made to do double duty if some other dishes, 
which need a like temperature, are prepared at the same 
time. To illustrate : If a casserole of lamb is to be served 
for a six-o'clock dinner, it would be put in at four o'clock, 
and a pan of baked apples, and the carrots, parsnips or 
other vegetables could be cooked along with it. As any 
casserole can be prepared in the morning for cooking 
for the evening dinner, or the day before if the dinner is 
at noon, this is a great preventive of last minute work. 

MENUS FOR OVEN MEALS 

The following are two menus for luncheon and dinner, 
which may be termed " oven meals," as nearly all the 
foods can be cooked in the oven with the same heat. 

A " Company " Luncheon 

Baked Oysters in Shell 
Casserole of Veal, Mexican Style 

Buttered Potatoes 

Tomatoes in Aspic, with Lettuce and Mayonnaise 
Coddled Pears with Whipped Cream 

Sponge Cakes 
Bon-bons Coffee 

A Home Dinner 

Clear Tomato Soup 
Casserole of Duck, Chicken, Lamb or Beef 

Baked Potatoes 
Sliced Onions in Broth 

Salad of Shaved Cabbage, Shredded Peppers and Romaine . 
Peach Tapioca with Meringue (in ramekins) 
Coffee 

In the first menu the veal needs about an hour and a 
half's cooking ; the potatoes an hour's ; the coddled pears 
two hours'; the sponge cake twenty minutes' and the 
oysters ten minutes'. Obviously the pears can go in 
first, the veal following, the sponge cakes can be baked as 
soon as they are put together. There will then be room 
for the potatoes, and the oysters can be put in " at the 
last minute." 

In the second menu the duck and tapioca should be put 
in at the same time, the onions a half hour later, the 



io8 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

potatoes following about an hour before dinner is to be 
served. 

Thickening the Casserole 

If desired, any meat casserole can be thickened with 
rice, ground dried bread crumbs, barley, macaroni, or 
spaghetti. The amount of raw rice to use to a quart of 
liquid is one-fourth of a cupful; the amount of crumbs, 
from a half to three-fourths of a cupful, according to 
the dryness of the bread, and of raw macaroni or spaghetti 
about a cupful. In some cases it is advisable to incor- 
porate the vegetable with the meat; for instance, a plain 
chicken casserole can be made in which the asparagus is 
combined with the chicken, being arranged in layers and 
thickened with rice. In case an especially abundant dish 
is desired, plenty of carrots, turnips and onions, together 
with beef, the whole being thickened with barley, is es- 
pecially satisfactory. 

Much has been said about the desirability of the cas- 
serole as a cooking medium for tough meats. Therein 
lies one of its greatest possibilities, for the meat benefits 
not only by the long cooking, but by the steam which is 
generated in the tightly-closed utensil. However, the 
liquid surrounding the meat should never boil ; unless it is 
kept at a gentle simmer, the result will be disappointing. 
In case the casserole seems too dry, a little stock or water 
may be added from time to time during the cooking. 

Left-Overs and Casseroles 

( Perhaps the woman who has learned to cook by im- 
agination will find. the casserole more useful than the one 
who cooks altogether by recipes, for the larder often con- 
tains various left-overs and odd vegetables which will fit 
into a delicious casserole, better than into any other dish. 
For instance, the woman who uses ham often finds scraps 
left over from cutting, bits of meat which have adhered 
to the bone, and the end which is unavailable for slicing. 
Often, she will utilize these strips for sandwiches, 
creamed ham, or an omelet for breakfast or luncheon, 
whereas they could be made into a much more substantial 
dish well-suited to a home dinner. I discovered this 
while keeping house on a farm ten miles from a railroad, 
when ham was a staple weekly article, and the garden in 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 109 

summer and the vegetable-cellar in winter were my chief 
assets. I used to oil my largest bean-pot with ham fat, 
put in a layer of sliced turnip, then a little minced ham, 
some parnsips, and more ham, a layer of sliced raw 
potatoes, some minced onions and shredded cabbage, in- 
terspersing every layer with ham, a sprinkling of flour 
and a little salt and pepper. Sometimes a few parboiled 
beans were added, the ingredients depending upon the 
season of the year. The whole was barely covered with 
ham liquor, or stock, and baked very slowly for at least 
three hours. 

Not long ago I tested a recipe in which beef tongue 
was used, but found myself confronted with the root end 
for utilization. Into the casserole went these bits of 
meat, together with some chopped carrots, minced onion, 
chopped green pepper, tomato, salt, pepper, a few spices, 
dry bread crumbs for thickening and a little of the tongue 
liquor. It was good casserole, but one truly inspired by 
imagination and necessity ! 

Suitable Casserole Combinations 

It is impossible to give all the combinations of meats 
and vegetables that are suitable to casserole use, but, as a 
general rule, it may be stated that the heavier vegetables 
of pronounced flavor, such as tomatoes, onions, carrots, 
turnips, parsnips and the like may be used with such 
heavy meats as beef, pork and ham, while the lighter 
vegetables peas, asparagus, string beans and corn 
are better suited to meats like chicken, pigeons, lamb, 
veal and guinea-fowl. This does not mean that onions, 
tomatoes and green peppers should be entirely omitted 
from the casseroles of lighter meats, but that they should 
be used more sparingly, only to assist in creating the fillip 
which will whet the appetite. 

Seasoning Casseroles 

The seasonings have a great deal to do with the success 
of the casserole whenever a " made dish " is being pre- 
pared. The touch of mint in the casserole of duck, for 
instance, lifts the dish into the epicurean. However, 
those who do not like highly-seasoned dishes will find the 
casserole of inestimable help in plain cookery. A fowl 



i io MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

disjointed as for plain fricassee, salted and peppered, 
rolled in flour, browned or not, according to whether a 
white or brown result is desired, packed in the casserole, 
covered with hot water, and baked for three to four 
hours, according to the age, makes possible a dish in 
which all the chicken flavor is retained, and which de- 
mands almost no attention from start to finish. A three- 
pound chicken prepared by the same method will cook to 
.perfection in fifty minutes to an hour in a glass cas- 
serole. 

Few people are conversant with the delicious flavor of 
properly cooked fish, because it is usually fried. More- 
over, most American housewives are prone to accept fish 
which is tainted. Just as soon as women realize that they 
control, by the law of supply and demand, the sale of 
absolutely pure food, the smell of strong fish will dis- 
appear from our markets and homes. The woman who 
lives at some distance from the market cannot usually 
procure fresh fish unless she is fortunate enough to have 
a sportsman in the family, but for her there are many 
varieties both salted and smoked. Properly treated, they 
are almost as good as when fresh. Salt cod, smoked 
halibut and salmon lend themselves admirably to casser- 
ole cookery. Salt mackerel, white fish, bloaters, as well 
as cod, salmon and halibut, can be used to most excellent 
advantage in the low, open casseroles, sometimes known 
as au gratin dishes, or on fireproof platters. 

Cooking Vegetables en Casserole 

It is sometimes advisable to cook turnips, parsnips, 
salsify, or chestnuts en casserole. In this case they 
should be prepared as for boiling, arranged in the cas- 
serole, covered with boiling stock, and cooked till tender, 
about three hours for the chestnuts and two for the vege- 
tables. The latter should be cut in thin slices before 
cooking, and should be covered with beef stock, while 
the chestnuts should be cooked in chicken or veal stock. 

Cooking Fruits en Casserole 

A specialty of a well-known tea-room is old-fashioned 
red apple sauce, served with whipped cream. It is rich 
and of beautiful color, as, much unlike ordinary apple 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS in 

sauce as can be imagined. Inquiry brought forth the 
fact that it was baked in the bean-pot, sliced apples and 
sugar being put in alternately, a little water added, and 
the whole cooked at least eight hours in a slow oven or 
fireless cooker. Pears and peaches may be cooked in a 
similar way, only, instead of being sliced, they should be 
pared, halved and the seeds removed, and they should 
not be stirred during the cooking. The various dried 
fruits may also be baked to good advantage. They 
should be washed thoroughly, soaked over night in water 
to cover, the proper amount of sugar added, together 
with any desired flavoring, and the baking done very 
slowly, the time varying from three to six hours, accord- 
ing to the quantity. Figs need lemon juice and rind, and 
may be served half cold from the casserole with a deco- 
ration of marshmallows. 

Various dishes well suited to casserole cookery will be 
found in the chapters on meats, fish, fruits and vegetables. 

COOKING BY STEAM 

The reduction of heat means the reduction of fuel. 
Every time a food can be adapted to top-of-the-stove- 
cookery, instead of the oven, there is a distinct saving, 
whether the cooking be by gas, kerosene or electricity. 

With gas and kerosene stoves cheap in price, and with 
gas plates and small kerosene stoves still cheaper, there is 
no excuse for any woman saying, " I cannot afford this 
kind of cookery." As a basis there must be two burners 
for a small family of three or four members, more 
burners for the large family. But here, as in everything 
else connected with the furnishing of the kitchen, too 
much space and too large quantities lead to carelessness, 
and, in this case, waste of fuel. 

The equipment for the cookery may be as inexpensive as 
one desires, but, if possible, it pays to buy the best quality 
in everything. The first purchase should be an adequate 
steamer, the size depending upon the family, but it should 
be large enough to make possible the cookery of several 
things at a time. There is nothing better in this line than 
the old-fashioned square cooker, equipped with shelves 
and a whistle which tells when water is needed. This 
cooker or steamer can be found in any large house-fur- 



H2 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

nishing store, from about five dollars and upwards, ac- 
cording to the grade of materials used. There are less 
expensive steamers, round in shape, which are equipped 
with shelves, and which can be used with good results, if 
one is careful to put the food demanding longest cookery 
on the bottom shelf, and the one which will be done first 
on the top shelf to make removal easy. Then there is a 
good combination, aluminum steamer, which consists of 
a base that can act as a roasting pan, a top with shelves 
on which the steaming is done, and a lid on which cookies 
can be baked. For short time steaming this gives ex- 
cellent results, but it is not so good in the cookery of 
things demanding a long time, because the base-pan is 
shallow, so that the water evaporates quickly. 

These utensils are adapted only to steaming, which 
means that the oven must be used for baking. There is, 
however, a steamer on the market in which either one of 
these processes may be carried on. It is a pressure 
cooker, made of iron or cast aluminum and fitted with a 
cover which clamps tightly into position. It is equipped 
with a valve, which makes possible the emission of steam 
before removing the lid, thus avoiding the possibility of 
even a slight scald, and it is so constructed that there is 
no danger of an explosion, no matter how much steam is 
generated, for when the pressure reaches twenty-five 
pounds, an automatic spring valve releases the steam. It 
takes only a few moments to bring this to the temperature 
of the oven, and bread, cake, meat, or whatever is to be 
baked, may be put in a pan, set on a rack and completed 
as in the oven, for the heavy heat makes .possible an even 
radiation. In pot-roasting or braising, the meat is simply 
seared in a little extra fat, put on the rack, and a very 
little water, plus the other desired seasonings, is added. 
For soup stock it is invaluable, only in this case, as in all 
others, where water is added, care must be taken not to 
put in too much, as there is very little evaporation. In 
case it is desirable to steam a pudding and two or three 
vegetables at once, a small amount of water is put in the 
bottom, the rack is adjusted, and the pudding in its mould, 
together with the vegetables in their various utensils, may 
be put in the cooker together. When the water is once 
boiling, the gas-flame may be reduced one-half. Some- 




AN ADEQUATE STEAMER 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 113 

times one desires to pot-roast veal or lamb. In this case 
the meat is started at the proper time and the other vege- 
tables are added according to the time it will take them 
to cook. 

The general type of utensils best suited to cookery by 
steam, or in these improvised ovens, is the one which will 
absorb the heat most quickly, or the one which, when the 
heat is once absorbed, will hold it longest. Aluminum is 
the best example of the first type, and the new glass cook- 
ing ware of the second. This glassware may be used for 
almost anything which is to be steamed : for instance, pos- 
sibly peas are to be cooked in this way they can be put 
into a glass utensil suited to the service, a little water, a 
few grains of sugar and a bit of butter may be added, 
and the whole steamed, covered or not, as desired. Pos- 
sibly swordfish is to figure as the main dish of a dinner. 
In this case the fish may be put in a suitable utensil, 
dotted with butter, a little salt and pepper, and a dash of 
lemon juice may be added, and the whole steamed until 
tender and flaky, about thirty minutes for fish cut three- 
quarters of an inch thick. If closely covered, other things, 
no matter how delicate, may be cooked in the same steamer 
with it, without absorbing the odors. If one only thinks, 
it is surprising to find how many foods may be steamed to 
good advantage. 

Most of us, when preparing a cereal, correctly start it 
over the direct heat, and, after fifteen minutes, set it into 
a double boiler to cook the remaining time, usually from 
one to four hours, according to the kind that is being 
cooked. At the same time it is necessary to replenish the 
cooking water frequently. There is no reason why the 
cereal cannot be started as usual, the cooking being com- 
pleted in the steamer along with some prunes, steamed 
apple sauce, an old fowl which demands long cookery to 
make it tender, a meat loaf or fish for the next day, or 
even some potatoes for the supper salad. There is no 
better way to save time and expense in cookery than to 
learn to do two or more things at once. 

In case a stove is not equipped with a warming closet, 
the steamer may be used for this purpose whenever hot 
dishes are needed, and, if some members of the family or 
guests are late in coming to a meal, the foods may be kept 



H4 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

hot in the steamer, with no more deterioration than in a 
hotel steam table. 

It is not necessary to use specific recipes for steam 
cooking, any of those which are in ordinary use being 
adaptable, with this exception. In steaming puddings in- 
stead of baking them, it is necessary to add a little more 
flour or bread crumbs, according to the type of puddings 
to be made. Oftentimes, if one desires a brown dish, as 
in making escalloped tomatoes or fish, the actual cookery 
may be accomplished in the steamer, the dish being set 
for a minute or two under the gas flame to brown over. 
However, the demand for this browned appearance is 
largely esthetic, and may be gained by strewing over a 
few fried bread crumbs, or the dish may be garnished 
with a little finely- minced parsley, a few sprays of water- 
cress, a little sliced, hard-cooked egg, some finely-minced 
celery with tips, a few slices of tomato, some pickles cut 
fan-shape, a whole olive or two, etc., according to the 
kind of dish that is being prepared. 

The following tables give a list of suggestions center- 
ing around standard recipes of foods that may be 
steamed : 

Fruits: Apples, pears, peaches, cherries, blueberries, 
blackberries, raspberries. If the fruit is desired whole, 
make a sugar syrup of one cupful of sugar to one-half 
cupful of water, boiling them together for five minutes. 
Pour this over the prepared fruit and steam until tender. 
Liquid, or powdered, spices, or lemon juice may be added 
as desired. Brown sugar is delicious with pears. If the 
fruit is desired broken up, it should be occasionally stirred 
during the cookery. 

Meats: Old fowl, steam five hours and remove the 
skin before slicing. Chicken, brown in fat and steam an 
hour. Shoulder of lamb, brown in fat and steam an 
hour and a half. It should be boned and rolled. Pork 
chops, brown quickly in fat and steam an hour. Rump of 
veal, brown together with onions and carrots, and steam 
an hour and a half to two hours, etc. All seasonings 
should be added when the meat is put in to steam, and, if 
possible, the meat should be in a covered utensil. All 
kinds of meat loaves may also be steamed. 

Fish: Salmon, haddock, codfish, lake trout, sword- 



SHORT-CUT PREPARATION OF MEALS 115 

fish, or bluefish. The thicker fish, as salmon, may be 
cut in steaks, seasoned and cooked, dotted with bits of 
butter, as described, or whole fish of more than three 
pounds may be laid in the utensil together with a tea- 
spoonful of pickle spice, a little vinegar, salt, pepper and 
water, and may be cooked in this. All kinds of fish 
loaves may also be steamed. 

Vegetables: Corn in the husk, peas, beans, succotash, 
corn in milk, spinach and other greens, with or without 
bacon or salt pork, turnips in broth, if desired, carrots, 
carrots and peas combined, whole tomatoes, summer 
squash, winter squash, cauliflower, cabbage, etc. The 
vegetables should be seasoned before putting on to cook, 
with the exception of green corn. 

Desserts: All kinds of fruit bettys, tapioca, corn 
starch and cereal puddings, cottage pudding, bread pud- 
ding, all kinds of custard mixtures which it may be de- 
sirable to solidify. Chocolate puffs made of any good 
chocolate-cake mixture plus a little more flour, all kinds 
of fruit dumplings, and the usual boiled puddings made 
of stale cake, stale bread, suet, etc. 

Breads: Boston brown bread and all allied mixtures, 
as steamed corn meal bread, steamed whole wheat and 
date bread, prune bread, steamed nut bread, etc. 



CHAPTER X 
THE SERVICE OF HOME AND COMPANY MEALS 

SERVING HOME MEALS WITHOUT A MAID 

It is not necessary to possess wealth in order to set 
an attractive table. The background is the table itself. 
If it has a polished top, it is often more convenient to 
use runners or doilies, instead of tablecloths. They may 
be used at all three meals, although to be strictly correct 
they should appear only at breakfast, luncheon or supper. 
If doilies or runners are used, the table-top should be 
waxed, not varnished, as the former finish is more dur- 
able, may be easily renewed, and does not show the marks 
of hot dishes or liquids that may be spilled. 

Runners should be from twelve to eighteen inches in 
width, and should be long enough to extend to the edge 
of the table. In setting the table for four, two runners 
are used. In setting the table for six, a long runner is 
placed lengthwise of the table, and two shorter ones are 
laid across it. 

Choosing the Linen 

All-white doilies and runners are more satisfactory 
for hard use than colored ones. If doilies are to be used 
constantly, choose several sets alike, so that if some of 
the pieces are soiled there will be fresh ones of the same 
design to replace them. For practical use a center doily, 
about eighteen inches, and plate doilies, from nine to 
twelve inches in diameter, are all that are necessary. 
Small doilies may be provided for the tumblers, if desired. 

For dinner it is customary to use a full-sized cloth 
over a silence cloth. But the woman who has to count 
laundry should feel at liberty to use on the dinner table 
whatever covering she wishes. It is surely easier to wash 
out a doily at a time than a whole tablecloth. But if a 
cloth effect is desired, a yard, or a yard and a quarter 
square of plain linen or damask may be bought ready- 

116 



HOME AND COMPANY MEALS 117 

made, or may be fashioned at home, and used for the din- 
ner table. In case colored squares are desired, there is 
nothing prettier than the Japanese cloths, which may be 
obtained from fifty cents up. 

The China, Silver and Glass 

There is some excuse for cheap dishes, but there is no 
excuse for handleless cups, and cracked or nicked plates 
and saucers, for, besides being unsightly, they are un- 
sanitary and carriers of disease. Dishes are only a back- 
ground for food, so quiet, simple patterns should be 
chosen. Well-polished glass lends an atmosphere to the 
table that almost nothing else can give, and unpretentious 
glass dishes may be made to look very attractive. Plain 
tumblers for water may be obtained almost anywhere for 
five cents apiece, and small glass bowls and cream pitch- 
ers, small dishes for relishes, lemonade cups and simple 
sherbet glasses may be purchased at correspondingly low 
prices. 

The silver should be the best one can afford, but no 
matter how beautiful it may be the whole effect of the 
table will be marred, if it is not well-polished. It takes 
considerable time to clean silver, if it is allowed to be- 
come tarnished; but if it is always washed in water con- 
taining a little ammonia, and if badly tarnished pieces are 
cleaned at once, the discoloration is not difficult to re- 
move. In case the plate wears off, any article may be re- 
plated at a reasonable price. 

Setting the Table 

The table service is greatly facilitated by placing all 
the silver used by each individual at his or her place. 
The various articles should be arranged in the order of 
use, the spoons and knives at the right, and the forks at 
the left in the order of use from outside toward the 
plate. If space is limited and the meal is informal the 
teaspoons may be placed above the plate but this is not 
strictly " good form." Salt and pepper shakers should 
be provided for each two people. Water glasses belong 
at the tips of the knives, and butter dishes, or bread and 
butter plates with butter spreaders, should be placed just 



ii8 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

above the forks. The napkins should be folded square, 
and laid at the left of the forks. 

How to Cook and Serve 

In case the mother cooks and serves the meal, as much 
food as possible should be placed on the table without 
overcrowding and without mixing the various courses. 
For instance, suppose that breakfast consists of fruit, un- 
cooked cereal and cream, ham, potatoes, muffins and cof- 
fee. The fruit should be served individually, or else be 
put on the table as a centerpiece, and the bowls of cereal 
may be set just above each plate. Before the family is 
called to breakfast the butter should be served, and the 
coffee cups be put in the handiest position for use. If 
the table is not crowded, the breakfast plates may stand 
at the left of the father's place; the serving knife and 
fork for the ham, and a tablespoon for the potatoes 
should be placed at the right. If a polished table is used, 
asbestos mats, covered with linen slips, or woven grass 
mats, should be placed wherever hot dishes are to be put. 

After the cereal and fruit .have been eaten, the dishes 
may be cleared onto a large tray and carried into the 
kitchen. On the same tray the pot of coffee, the pota- 
toes, ham and muffins may be brought back to the dining 
room. A tray rest, such as used in all hotel dining rooms, 
will be found a great convenience in case an empty serv- 
ing table is not at hand. According to this plan a mother 
would need to make but one trip to the kitchen during 
breakfast. 

Dinner is usually a hearty meal, but it can be served 
in the same general way. Suppose that the menu con- 
sists of soup, pot-roast, spaghetti, onions, celery, apple 
dumplings with lemon sauce and coffee. In this case 
the water should be poured, the butter served, and the 
bread placed on the table, as well as the crackers for the 
soup. The soup plates may stand before the mother, if 
the soup is to be served at the table, or may be filled and 
brought in just before the meal is announced. The din- 
ner plates should stand 'at the father's left, or may be 
placed individually ready for the soup plates. The serv- 
ing utensils for the meat and vegetables should be placed 
at the father's right. 



HOME AND COMPANY MEALS 119 

After the completion of the soup course, the soiled 
dishes should be removed, as described, and the main 
portion of the dinner brought in. After this is eaten, 
the soiled dishes should be removed, the glasses filled 
and the dessert served. The coffee service may be ar- 
ranged on a tray, which may be set directly on the table. 
On first thought it may seem too much of a task to serve 
a meal in courses, but it must be borne in mind that the 
dishes have to go to the kitchen anyway, and it is much 
easier to clear them away a section at a time, scraping 
and stacking them when the tray is being unloaded, than 
to attempt to untangle the heap of dishes that are piled 
helter-skelter on a table that is not cleared during the 
entire meal. 

In case it is desirable to serve with more formality, 
and there is no maid, no woman should assume the task 
alone. The place of the mother is at the table, not only 
because of the effect she has on the children, but because 
of the selfishness that she is likely to inculcate in case she 
insists on waiting on them. It is an easy matter to train 
the older children to wait on the table, provided a few 
simple directions are heeded. 

SERVING COMPANY-MEALS WITH A MAID 

In case the meal is to be served by a waitress, it is cus- 
tomary to have on the table the following articles, when 
the meal is announced : At each plate the silver should 
be laid for the various courses up to the dessert, the forks 
on the left, the knives, spoons and oyster forks, if used, 
on the right in the order of use from the outside toward 
the plate. If used, the bread and butter plates with the 
spreaders, laid horizontally across, should be at the tips 
of the forks, and each should contain a roll, or one or two 
thin slices of bread and a pat of butter. Bread and but- 
ter plates are not used at a formal dinner or very formal 
breakfast or luncheon. The water glasses (or goblets 
for a dinner) should stand at the tips of the knives, the 
nut dishes and individual salts and peppers, if used, 
above the plates, the napkins (folded over once) at the 
left with the place cards upon them, and the service plates 
should be set between the forks and knives, like them 
an inch from the edge of the table. The glasses should 



120 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

be filled three- fourths full, and the first course should 
be in position on the service plate when the meal is 
announced. If a set of salts and peppers is provided for 
each two guests, they should be placed within easy reach 
of both. The relishes, such as celery and olives, are 
usually passed by the maid with the appropriate courses. 
It is no longer permissible to place them upon the table 
around the centerpiece. 

The meal is served largely from the pantry, only the 
meat, the dessert, if desired, and the coffee, if the hostess 
wishes, being served at the table. In serving, the wait- 
ress passes all foods to the left, places all foods to the 
right, and, when removing a course which is to be im- 
mediately replaced by the following, she takes up the 
empty plate with the left hand and sets down the next 
course with the right hand. When the main course is 
served, the simplest method, after the carving utensils 
have been brought in and the meat placed, is to put before 
each guest a warmed plate replacing the service-plate. 
One extra plate should be at hand, and, as soon as the host 
has apportioned the service on the plate before him, the 
waitress should remove it, replacing it with the empty 
plate, place the filled plate before the first guest to be 
served, bringing back the empty plate to the host. The 
procedure is as before till all are served. 

The first person to be served when the second course 
is placed is the lady at the right of the host. On serv- 
ing the succeeding course the next lady should have the 
preference, and so on. In this way no lady is served 
last all the time. If desired, the ladies may all be served 
first, and then the men, but this method causes confusion, 
and is not often used. 

Vegetables, gravy and other accessories should be 
passed on a small, doily-covered tray, or the dishes may 
be held in the hand if a napkin, or serving mitt, is pro- 
vided. Between courses the waitress should replenish 
the water glasses, butter balls and anything else neces- 
sary. If extra silver is needed, it should be laid at the 
right of each guest but never passed on a dish containing 
a portion of food. Before serving dessert the table should 
be entirely cleared of everything except water glasses, 
decorations and favors, should be crumbed by means of 



HOME AND COMPANY MEALS 121 

a fringed napkin and plate, the water glasses filled, and 
the dessert served either from the pantry or by the hos- 
tess, according to the method described ; however, if de- 
sired, a pile of plates may be set at the hostess's left, 
the waitress placing an empty plate in front of the hostess, 
replacing it when filled with another plate from the pile, 
and serving the guests in rotation. 

The coffee may follow the dessert, or be poured by the 
hostess in the drawing-room. Finger-bowls should be 
served last on doily-covered plates which are not used 
for any other purpose. They are placed either at the 
right of, or directly in front of, the guests. 

SERVING COMPANY-MEALS WITHOUT 
A MAID 

In case the service is without a maid the procedure 
must of necessity be simplified. The meal should be of 
such a character that the foods can stand in the warm- 
ing-oven and do not need any last-minute cooking. The 
individual places should be set as described. At the host's 
place should be laid the carving-knife and fork and gravy 
ladle; at the place to his left should be laid spoons for 
serving the various vegetables. 

If this is done by a second person, it will greatly sim- 
plify the host's work at the table. Silver for the des- 
sert may in this case ONLY be laid above the plate. The 
service-plate should be dispensed with except for the 
soup. In this case the soup and service plates should be 
removed together, as there may be confusion in passing 
if the service plate is used for the meat course. The 
salad may be arranged in a large bowl and dressed by 
the hostess at the table. The relishes may be on the 
table, as well as a plate of bread. Extra butter balls, 
water and whatever replenishings may be needed should 
be within easy reach on the buffet or wheel-tray. If there 
are guests, great care must be taken to avoid giving the 
impression that the hostess is " waiting on them." To 
this end the service should be from the table as far as 
possible and the older boys and girls should be called to 
wait upon the table. This plan works well, especially if 
there are two to do it It is astonishing how service of 
this kind develops greater interest in home life and deeper 



122 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

appreciation of the mother. Before dessert the table is 
cleared and crumbed and the dessert is served by the 
hostess. 

Coffee may follow, being poured at the table. It al- 
ways takes longer to serve a meal without a maid, if 
time is taken between courses to stack up the soiled dishes 
in proper form for dish-washing, but in the end this is a 
great time-saver, and it certainly means much to go into 
a kitchen that looks fairly tidy after the serving of a 
company meal. So the waits between courses are justi- 
fied. 

The service for a formal breakfast is as described in 
this section. However, whereas candles are usually used 
at a formal dinner and sometimes at formal luncheons, 
if the room is dark and the weather dreary, they are out 
of place at a breakfast. Bouillon cups may be used at 
both breakfast and luncheon but not at a dinner. 

For breakfasts and luncheons a handsome set of doilies, 
or runners, may be used, but at a dinner the table should 
be entirely covered with a cloth. Medium-sized Madeira, 
or other fancy, napkins may be used at breakfasts or 
luncheons, but only napkins of large size and of a type 
to harmonize with the cloth should be used at a dinner. 



CHAPTER XI 
THE CHAFING DISH 

A woman is always at her best when performing some 
house-wifely rite, and over the chafing dish, with its 
many opportunities for skill and grace, she is supreme. 
But being really graceful depends considerably upon the 
arrangements. In the first place the chair should be 
high, for it is impossible to stir with ease, unless one's 
hands are near the top of the dish. A piano-chair is al- 
ways practical as it can be turned up to just the right 
height. A hassock should also be provided. 

The chafing dish itself should be set upon an uncov- 
ered tray to avoid all danger of fire from the lamp, and 
damage from boiling water. Just before setting in place 
the lamp should be filled and covered (to prevent evapora- 
tion). The ordinary lamp will hold about a quarter of 
a cupful enough to burn a half hour. Extra alcohol 
should be in the filler, or, if one is not at hand, a covered 
pitcher may be used. As to the fuel, only pure grain or 
denatured alcohol is suitable, wood alcohol being very un- 
satisfactory because of its disagreeable odor. 

The cooking utensils should be placed at the right of 
the tray, as one of the essentials of the success of chafing 
dish cookery lies in noiselessness. Only wooden spoons 
should be used for stirring; these may be obtained in 
olive or apple wood, fashioned in attractive design, and 
sell at almost any price. However, the regulation silver 
chafing dish spoon and fork should be used for the serv- 
ice. 

Along with the spoons should be set a salt and pepper 
shaker, whatever other seasonings are used, as Worces- 
tershire, or tabasco sauce, celery salt, etc., for no ex- 
pert at the chafing dish ever seasons by measure (it looks 
too unprofessional) ; an extra napkin to be used in case 
of accident, and a spoon and fork to use for testing, if 

123 



124 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

one is not sure of the seasoning. Matches, too, should 
be provided. 

All the ingredients should be prepared beforehand and 
set within easy reach upon the dining table, or upon a 
small table or wheel tray. If the latter is used, it will 
facilitate the service of the whole meal, for a chafing dish 
affair is always informal and the guests can pass up their 
soiled dishes to be stowed away on one of the empty 
trays. 

The chafing dish is not suited to elaborate cookery, but 
rather to quickly prepared mixtures, like eggs, oysters, 
cheese, etc., and to rechauffes, that is, re-heated cooked 
meats, fish and vegetables. However, for anything that 
is to be prepared, all ingredients should be measured and 
set in pretty receptacles. For instance, if hard-cooked 
eggs are to be sliced, it should be done beforehand. If 
chicken or fish is to be creamed, it should be diced, cheese 
sliced or shaved, as the case may be, oysters carefully 
washed and freed from the shell; butter made up into 
balls containing just a tablespoonful ; flour measured, 
etc. If this is accurately done ahead in the quiet of the 
kitchen, all danger of failure is overcome, as nothing will 
be forgotten, and it will not be necessary to have a 
recipe in evidence this always betrays the amateur! 

Anything that can be cooked in a double boiler, or be 
prepared in a saucepan, is adapted to the chafing dish, 
although frying should not be attempted because of the 
disagreeable odor. As the chafing dish is primarily used 
so that foods can be served at once, and very hot, it also 
seems out of place to prepare dishes that must be ar- 
ranged upon platters for service. The hot-water pan cor- 
responds to the bottom of the double boiler, and the 
blazer to the top. Both should be supplied with handles. 
Other attachments are often used, as a toaster or a 
broiler, but they are not at all necessary. 

As the chafing dish is limited to informal occasions, 
it is generally used only in the following instances : Sun- 
day night tea, after-theater suppers, buffet luncheons, or 
as the hot course -at a luncheon when there is no maid in 
attendance. The usual accompaniments are little rolls 
or biscuits, dainty sandwiches that harmonize with the 
dish to be prepared, a suitable salad, and a simple dessert. 



THE CHAFING DISH 125 

If the salad is of fruit, it is often used in place of a sweet. 
A drink also is indispensable, the selection depending on 
the balance of the meal ; tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, 
ginger ale, and fruit beverages of all kinds are in order. 
Unless a definite first course is provided, as a bouillon or 
fruit cup, a few hors d'ocuvres should be passed to occupy 
the guests until the chafing dish creation is prepared. 
These may include olives, radishes, celery sticks, canapes, 
tiny, open fish sandwiches (one slice of bread only being 
used) and pimentoes in various forms. 

The following menus show how these meals may be

The chafing dish is usually adopted when there is no 
maid in attendance, and, because of this, food for the en- 
tire meal is often placed on the table at once. 

The first course is in position when the guests are called 
to the table, the chafing dish, with ingredients, is set in 
place, with a pile of serving plates beside it. The salad, 
arranged on a platter or in a bowl, is set at the place op- 
posite, the plates being at the left of it while the dessert 
(unless an ice) is served individually, and set at the right 
of each guest ; the'hors d'ceuvers and plates of sandwiches, 
cake, etc., are set where it is convenient. Extra butter 
and a carafe or pitcher of water are also on the table, while 
the service for coffee, tea, or any other drink to be served 



A 




THE CHAFING DISH 127 

is arranged on a tray and set either before one of the 
guests, or stands in readiness on the buffet for the 
hostess. After the chafing dish has been removed tea 
or 'coffee is usually made at the table. 

If a chafing dish luncheon is being given and a maid 
is in attendance, the ingredients and plates are brought 
in by the maid. The hostess serves directly to the plates 
which are passed by the attendant. In cases where a 
maid is not employed the menu should be simple, the first 
course being in position when the meal is announced, the 
second consisting of the article that is to be prepared. 
In this case it is permissible to have the chafing dish on 
the table from the first, although it should be removed 
with the soiled dishes after the course is finished. 

To be successful a chafing dish affair should not include 
more than ten guests in fact six is a more convenient 
number for the chafing dish has not been made that 
will serve more. If a larger group is to be accommo- 
dated, the tables should be enlarged, and a friend invited 
to preside over a second chafing dish. 

A study of the chapters in this book which are devoted 
to left-over meats, eggs, cheese, souffles, vegetables and 
fish will suggest many dishes that can be easily made in 
the chafing dish. 



PART TWO 



CHAPTER .1 
MEASUREMENTS 

There is no such thing as " good luck " or " bad luck " 
in cooking, if the recipe measurements are absolutely ac- 
curate and the housewife understands the range. Al- 
though many authorities advocate measuring out before- 
hand all ingredients needed for the dish to be prepared, 
any practical woman will readily see that this makes 
necessary the use of too many measuring utensils and 
dishes. It is much better always to keep standard half- 
pint measuring cups in the sugar and flour cans, tea- 
spoons in the salt jar or tea cannister, and tablespoons in 
the coffee can, corn starch jar and so on. During the 
average morning's cooking it should not be necessary to 
use more than two extra measuring cups, one for ingredi- 
ents not already provided with cups, the other for fats 
and liquids. There should also be a teaspoon and a 
tablespoon each for dry and liquid ingredients. 

The equipment for accurate measuring is as follows: 
One standard half -pint tin or aluminum measuring cup; 
one standard half-pint glass measuring cup ; one standard 
half-pint pitcher cup (for use in making mayonnaise, 
and the like), each divided into thirds and quarters ; one- 
quart aluminum or tin cup divided into quarters, and 
standard tablespoons and teaspoons. 

To measure a cupful of any dry ingredient, fill it full 
and level off the top with a knife, taking care not to pack 
it in. A spoonful should be measured in the same way 
it should never be " rounded," unless specified. To 
measure half an ordinary teaspoonful, fill it level, scrap- 
ing it off, and divide the contents into halves lengthwise. 
Flour, confectioner's sugar, baking soda and any other 
ingredient which is liable to lump should be sifted before 
measuring, while mustard, baking powder, etc., which 
settle from standing in the can, should be stirred to 
lighten. 



132 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

A cupful, or spoonful, of any liquid is as much as the 
utensil will hold without running over. All fats, as but- 
ter, oleomargarine, lard or drippings, are packed down 
and leveled before measuring. When they are to be 
melted, it is specified in the recipe. Sixteen tablespoon- 
fuls, level, of anything, will fill a half-pint cup. In pre- 
paring a portion of a recipe this rule will be found a great 
help. 



CHAPTER II 
BEVERAGES 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

TEA 

Good tea can be made only in a pot of china, silver or 
earthenware, as tea contains a decided acid and bitter 
substance, which is liable to combine with the metal of 
other receptacles, producing an unpleasant flavor and an 
unwholesome beverage. The problem in making tea is to 
bring out the stimulating principle therein, as well as the 
fragrant oil, and to avoid the development of the tannic 
acid. This can only be done by pouring boiling water 
over the tea, as water which is merely simmering does not 
develop the flavor. Tea should not stand on the leaves 
more than five minutes. 

MAKING TEA 

The easiest way to make tea in a pot is to measure the 
tea into a tea ball, which may be hung to the nozzle of the 
tea pot by the chain to which the ball is attached. At 
the end of five minutes the ball may be quickly lifted from 
the infusion and the leaves easily emptied into the garb- 
age can, for nothing stains a white porcelain sink more 
quickly than tea and tea leaves. This tea-ball method is 
a real short cut, for it saves the washing of a strainer 
and a second pot into which the infusion must be strained, 
if the water is poured directly on the loose tea leaves. 
Needless to say the tea pot must be thoroughly washed 
and scalded. Tea should never be boiled. 

The proportion of tea for each cup varies with the 
brand, but half a teaspoonful of good tea should be 
ample. 

133 



134 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Iced Tea 

6 teaspoonfuls tea cupful syrup stock or sugar 

teaspoonful whole cloves to taste (if desired) 

i sliced lemon I quart boiling water 

Put the tea in a crock or pitcher, pour over the boiling 
water and let stand, covered, five minutes in a warm 
place. Then strain it on to the cloves, lemon and sweet- 
ening, stir and let cool. Serve with a thin slice of lemon 
to each glass. Iced tea should be made stronger than 
ordinary tea, to allow for the ice dilution. 

Afternoon Tea 

i teaspoonful tea Sliced lemon 

Candied or Maraschino cher- Whole cloves 

ries Boiling water 
Lime drops 

Measure the tea into the tea ball, put the cup with the 
desired flavoring (two cherries to a cupful), three cloves, 
one lime drop, or one slice of lemon, and pour over boil- 
ing water, allowing the ball to remain in until the tea is of 
the desired strength. Two cupfuls of tea may be made 
at a time without refilling the ball. 

COFFEE 

Coffee must be made as carefully as tea, in order to 
develop the fragrant flavor without overdeveloping the 
caffeine and tannin. To this end it should be made as 
quickly as possible and without much cooking. The best 
method is as the coffee tasters make it, the next, perco- 
lating or filtering. Old-fashioned boiled coffee is the 
least desirable method. 

There are two essentials in making good coffee first, 
an absolutely clean utensil; second, a generous quantity 
of a pure brand of coffee unmixed with chicory. Given 
these, no matter if the vessel be a tomato can or a silver 
urn, the result will be perfect, if care is used. Coffee 
should never be allowed to stand on the grounds after it 
is finished. 

A moderate amount of well-made coffee, without cream 
or sugar, is a mild stomach stimulant, as well as slightly 
laxative. It has, however, a distinct influence on the 
nervous system, sometimes leading to general nervous- 



BEVERAGES 135 

ness, tremulousness, loss of sleep and dizziness. In some 
cases actual indigestion may be traced to it, as caffeine 
acts adversely on some people, retarding digestion and 
causing flatulence with a consequent " sinking heart " 
sensation. Children are especially susceptible to these 
influences and should never be allowed to drink coffee. 

There are several kinds of powdered coffee on the mar- 
ket, which may be dissolved in boiling water, and, if a 
really good brand is chosen, this is a satisfactory and 
economical method. 

Coffee (Coffee Taster's Method) 

To make the best coffee it should not .be boiled. 

Allow a tablespoon ful of medium-ground coffee to 
each person. Put it in a heated enamel pot, and pour 
over it a coffee cupful of boiling water for each table- 
spoonful used. Bring to the boil and then let stand four 
minutes where it will keep hot, but not boil. Then add 
a dash of cold water to settle it. Coffee made according 
to this recipe contains a minimum amount of caffeine 
and tannin. 

Percolator Coffee 

Put the coffee in the percolator, pour in one cupful 
cold water to two tablespoonfuls miedium-ground coffee 
for each cup to be made and put on the glass top. Set 
on the sheet-iron plate over the fire, bring to boiling 
point, and let boil from three to five minutes, according 
to the strength desired. 

After-Dinner Coffee 

Increase the amount of coffee one-half, and make either 
by the coffee filter or percolator method. 

Cereal Coffee 

3 pounds whole wheat 3 tablespoonfuls molasses 

i pound whole barley 3 tablespoonfuls butter 

i cupful ground chicory 

Roast the wheat and barley until brown, stirring often. 
When as dark as a coffee berry, add the butter and molas- 
ses, stirring it until all is absorbed and the grains separate. 
Remove from the oven and, when cold, add the chicory. 



136 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Grind in a coffee mill. To make, use 2 tablespoon fuls 
of "coffee" to each person and ij cupfuls cold water. 
Boil an hour, and serve with sugar and cream or milk. 

COCOA AND CHOCOLATE 
Cocoa 

Cocoa, as directed on package 3 cupfuls milk 
i cupful sugar teaspoonful salt 

3 cupfuls water 

Mix the sugar, salt and cocoa together, thoroughly ; add 
the water, and boil five minutes. Add milk, boil up once, 
then beat with the Dover egg-beater, and serve. In mak- 
ing cocoa for children or invalids do not boil up the bev- 
erage bring the milk just to a scald and combine with 
the boiled cocoa and water. 

Hot Chocolate 

2.\ squares (ounces) chocolate Few grains salt 

i cupful sugar ii cupfuls boiling water 

3i cupfuls milk 

Shave the chocolate and add to the milk. Place over 
hot water and scald until the chocolate is melted. Add 
the water, sugar and salt and cook one hour. Beat well 
with an egg-beater and serve in chocolate cups with 
whipped cream, or 2 marshmallows to each cup. 

Creole Chocolate 

1 quart milk, scalded cupful sugar 

2 squares (ounces) chocolate \ teaspoonful vanilla 
I inch stick cinnamon Few grains salt 

I cupful boiling water I cupful whipped cream 

Scald the milk with the cinnamon. Melt the chocolate, 
add the water, and, when smooth, add to the milk with 
the salt and sugar. Cook at least an hour over hot water, 
add vanilla, " mull " or beat with an egg-beater, and 
serve in chocolate cups with whipped cream. 

. COLD DRINKS 

There is no reason why any household cannot enjoy 
a wide variety of cold drinks with but little expense and 
trouble, and without patronizing the soda fountain to 



BEVERAGES 137 

an undue extent. It takes but little time to make up a few 
syrups which may be kept in sterilized bottles for use as 
needed. Plain syrup stock, that is a syrup of sugar and 
water, should always be kept on hand both in winter and 
summer, as it provides a rich, smooth sweetening for any 
drink, hot or cold, besides saving considerable time in 
preparation when it is needed. In other words, it is a 
" short cut " to have syrup enough for instant use in 
making a number of lemonades, or whatever the drink 
may be, instead of stopping to boil it each time. 

Plain Syrup Stock

CHAPTER III 
FRUITS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

PREPARING FRESH FRUITS FOR SERVING 

Unless fruit is freshly picked and is free from dust and 
from all possible contamination, it should always be thor- 
oughly washed before serving. This includes bananas, 
Oranges, grapes and all fruits. The easiest way to wash 
the larger fruits is to put them in a colander and rinse 
them thoroughly in cold water ; then drain them on paper 
towels. This should be done as soon as they come into 
the kitchen. Blackberries, strawberries and raspberries 
should be put in the colander, rinsed quickly, and then 
hulled, care being used to rid the fruit of all possible in- 
sects. 

Oranges to be Eaten with a Spoon 

The fruit should be cut in halves crosswise and, if 
these do not stand level, a thin slice of skin may be cut 
from the ends. The pulp around the edge should then 
be loosened by a curved grapefruit knife, which makes 
the process very quick. The membrane between the sec- 
tions should be loosened until it is tender, and, if there 
is much pith in the center, it should be removed. 

Oranges Flower Fashion 

Cut down the skin in quarters, and then in eighths, to 
within an inch of the blossom end; then strip down in 
points and fold them over. 

Orange Sections on a Strip of Peel 

Cut an inch band around the 'orange crosswise through 
the center, remove the remaining skin, cut the strip and 
open out the sections. 

144 



FRUITS 145 

Oranges au Naturel 

Separate the orange into sections, arrange around a 
mound of sugar, or an individual plate, separating the sec- 
tions with a few cluster raisins. Allow five sections to 
a person. 

To Obtain Orange and Grapefruit Sections for Fruit Cups 
and Salads 

Pare the fruit with a sharp knife till the juice runs 
and then cut out each section separately with a sharp 
knife. This is a quick method, and when it is used there 
is not only less waste but the pulp is kept whole and in 
perfect condition. These sections are called " carpels." 

Sliced Oranges, Pullman Fashion 

Pare the oranges with a sharp knife, slice thin cross- 
wise, and arrange in glass dessert dishes with a little 
sugar between each slice. Chill thoroughly. If desired, 
some sweetened pineapple juice, or the juice from other 
canned fruit, may be poured over the orange slices, and 
the whole well-chilled. Cocoanut may be sprinkled over 
the serving if to act as a dessert. 

Oranges en Casserole 

Select thin-skinned Florida oranges, cut in halves, 
scoop out the seeds, fill the centers with sugar, arrange 
the halves in a glass casserole, pour in a cupful of water, 
and place a bit of butter on each half. Cook, covered, in 
a moderate oven till the skins are tender, about two 
hours. Then uncover to brown. 

Orange Compote 

6 navel oranges 2 cupfuls granulated sugar 

i lemon 2 cupfuls apricot juice 

i cupful water 

Separate the oranges into sections without breaking 
the membrane. Make a syrup of the water, sugar, apri- 
cot and lemon juice, boiling five minutes, or until it 
threads. Add oranges, cover and cool. Chill at least 
an hour before serving.

To Prepare Grapefruit 

Wash and cut the grapefruit in halves crosswise ; cut 
around the outer edge of the pulp with a grapefruit knife. 
Snip the connecting cellulose with sharp scissors, and re- 
move it with the center membrane, leaving the sections of 
pulp whole and in their places. 

If desired sweet, fill the centers with sugar and let 
stand two hours before serving. If to be served without 
sugar as a luncheon appetizer, add a drop of tabasco 
sauce and a raw oyster. 

Grapefruit, Filled with Tokay Grapes 

Allow half a grapefruit to twelve Tokay grapes for 
each person. Loosen the grapefruit pulp, cutting the 
membrane and lifting it out as directed. Halve and seed 
the grapes. Add as much sugar to the grapefruit as is 
desired. Heap on the Tokay grapes and set aside for 
two hours occasionally " basting " the grapes with the 
grapefruit juice, as it accumulates. 

Bananas with Lemon Juice 

Wash and dry the bananas. Cut the ends off square 
and split the fruit in halves lengthwise. Divide the pulp 
in the skin into convenient mouth fuls, sprinkle with lemon 
juice and then plentifully with powdered sugar. Serve 
from the skins. 

Baked Bananas with Raisins 

Peel the bananas and split lengthwise. Place in a 
baking dish, sprinkle the banana lightly with sugar and 
a little lemon juice, add a few raisins and water barely 
to cover the bottom of the dish. Cover and bake till 
tender, about twenty minutes, basting every five minutes 
with the water in the pan. 

Baked Bananas with Cranberry Syrup 

Peel the bananas and leave them whole. Place in a 
baking dish and- put a bit of butter on each. Bake in 
a moderate oven twenty-five minutes, basting often with 
a little cranberry syrup. Serve with additional syrup as 
a sauce.

Fried Bananas 

Peel the bananas and cut in slices lengthwise and then 
crosswise. Brown gently in bacon fat and serve with 
broiled or baked bacon, or with lamb. If desired, they 
may be browned in butter or a good vegetable oil. In 
the latter case they should be slightly salted, and, if de- 
sired, may be lightly sprinkled with sugar, and a few 
drops of lemon juice. 

Pineapple au Naturel 

i ripe pineapple Powdered sugar 

Dissect the pineapple into sections by means of a fork, 
separating around each " eye." It will be dissected easily 
into wedge-shaped pieces. Make mounds of powdered 
sugar on individual plates by packing it into a small after- 
dinner coffee cup or timbale mould; surround with the 
pineapple sections, and serve garnished with leaves of 
the pineapple. To eat, use the ringers, dipping the fruit 
into the sugar. 

Sweetened Pineapple 

Pare the pineapple and remove the eyes with the pine- 
apple scissors, then grasp the crown of the pineapple 
firmly and shred down the pulp with a silver fork, leav- 
ing the core. Sprinkle liberally with granulated sugar, 
add a dash of lemon juice if desired, transfer to a covered 
glass jar and let chill a few hours before serving. If 
the pineapple is not very juicy, add a little warm water 
with the sugar. 

Pineapple and Fruit, Fresh or Half-Frozen 

I large pineapple i pint sliced oranges, sliced 

Sugar to taste bananas, sliced pears or

Cut off the crown of the pineapple. Pare away the 
base so that it will set even, and with a knife and strong 
spoon scoop out the pulp. Then separate it from the 
core. Add this pulp to the other fruit, sweeten to taste, 
put in a covered jar, and pack in three parts of ice to 
one part of salt. Let stand an hour. When ready to 
serve turn into the chilled pineapple shell and garnish the 
base with pineapple leaves.

Frosted Grapes 

Select large Malaga or Tokay grapes. After washing 
and drying rub them lightly with egg white, applying it 
with the ringers. Sift granulated sugar over them so 
that they are " frosted " and set in a draft of air to dry. 

Use as a garnish for fruit cups, grape sherbet, etc. 

Strawberries au Naturel 

Make mounds of the sugar by packing it into small 
timbale moulds and turning out into the center of small 
plates. Brush the berries to remove any grit (do not 
wash unless absolutely necessary) and do not remove 
the hulls. Place in a circle around the sugar and eat with 
the fingers. 

Strawberries Italian 

Hull the berries, rinse with cold water and arrange 
in a jar in layers with sugar to sweeten. Add a little 
warm water to start the juice and the juice of half a 
lemon to a quart of berries. Let chill several hours be- 
fore serving. 

To Prepare Blackberries, Loganberries and Raspberries 

Hull and rinse, arrange in layers with sugar to sweeten, 
add a little warm water to start the juice and chill for 
two hours. 

To Serve Peaches 

The quickest method for removing the skins is to scald 
the fruit with boiling water. If to stand any length of 
time before serving, sprinkle with sugar and a few drops 
of lemon juice to prevent discoloration. 

Another method, when the peaches are large, is to re- 
move the skins, cut the fruit in halves lengthwise, take 
out the stones, heap the centers with powdered sugar and 
serve the two halves on a small plate. 

Halved Stuffed Peaches 

Select large ripe peaches, peel them, and cut in halves, 
allowing one peach to each person. Sprinkle lightly with 
powdered sugar and lemon juice, and fill the centers of 



FRUITS 149 

each with chopped, blanched almonds and raspberry jam. 
Serve with or without whipped cream.

Do not skin the rhubarb. Combine it with the raisins 
and water, and bake in a covered dish till the rhubarb 
is soft and pink. Add the sugar halfway of the cooking. 

Coddled Pears 

Select a dozen winter pears, wash thoroughly and place 
in an open stewpan with a cupful and a half of light 
brown sugar, two and one-half cupfuls of water and the 
rind of a lemon. Stew very slowly uncovered, turning 
often, for about two hours. Replenish the water if neces- 
sary. Remove the pears and cook the syrup down to a 
thick consistency. Add a tablespoonful of lemon juice 
to it and pour over the pears. 

Apples with Cheese 

Select apples of marked flavor and good color. Serve 
well-polished, passing Neufchatel or cream cheese. The 
apple is to be sliced, the cheese spread upon it and eaten 
by means of the ringers. This is a typical Italian dish. 

Broiled Apples 

Pare the apples and core them, cut in thick, crosswise 
slices, dip in crumbs and melted butter, and broil gently 
until they are tender. 

West India Baked Apples

sugar, until tender. Carefully shape and fill the centers 
with boiled rice. Pour over the syrup from the apples, 



FRUITS 151 

which has been simmered until thick. Cool and serve 
with whipped cream. 

Apples, Cranberry Style 

Select perfect apples, core them and fill the spaces with 
cranberry conserve or jelly. Bake gently, basting fre- 
quently with a syrup made of equal parts of sugar and 
water. When tender, transfer to a serving-dish and pour 
over them the syrup which should be thick enough to jelly. 
Chill the apples, and serve with whipped cream flavored 
with sifted cranberry sauce ; use one-fourth cupful of this 
to one cupful of heavy cream, sweetened to taste. 

Stewed Plums with Chestnuts 

i* cupfuls sugar ii cupfuls boiled chestnuts 

2& lemons 2 dozen purple plums 

ii cupfuls water 

Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes ; then 
add the lemon, sliced thin, and the plums, cooking gently 
till they are tender. Remove the plums and cook down 
the syrup one-half. In the meantime remove the shells 
from the chestnuts, add to the syrup when it is done and 
pour over the plums. Serve very cold. 

Fruit Cups or Cocktails 

Fruit Cups or Cocktails may be made of almost any 
fruit in combination with one or two others, if properly 
sweetened and flavored. As the portions should be small, 
not more than two tablespoonfuls of fruit and juice to 
a person, the fruit cocktail can often be made of materials 
which are on hand. In many instances, as with currants 
and other fruits which are very acid, the smoothness 
of the cocktail depends upon a little preliminary cooking. 
For instance, to make a cocktail of a cupful of currants, 
a few raspberries and a little mint, sugar, in proportion 
to the acidity of the currants, should be combined with 
them together with a little tepid water, not more than two 
tablespoonfuls, and the whole gently cooked for about 
five minutes. If this is done, the fruit may be kept for 
several days, the raw raspberries and a trace of mint be- 
ing added at least two hours before serving time so that 
the flavors may become blended. It is a good plan to put 



152 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

the cocktail together in a glass jar early in the day and 
let it stand next to the ice till serving-time. If raw fruits 
entirely are to be used, they should be allowed to stand 
in a syrup made of a cupful of sugar to a half cupful of 
water to insure smoothness of flavor. Many fruits are 
greatly improved by the addition of a little lemon juice 
not enough to make the cocktail sour, but just a dash 
to heighten the natural flavor. Various combinations of 
fruits, suitable to use in cocktails, are : 

1. Blackberries and sugar syrup (as above) with nut- 
meg and lemon juice to season. 

2. Red raspberries, diced oranges and sugar syrup. 

3. Shredded fresh pineapple, with stoned cherries and 
sugar syrup, or diced oranges and syrup, with or without 
a trace of mint. 

4. Small cubes or tiny balls of watermelon, diced pine- 
apple, syrup and lemon juice to taste. 

5. Cubed canteloupe, with sugar syrup, nutmeg and 
lemon juice to taste, if desired. 

6. Blackberries, syrup and diced banana. 

7. Diced peaches, syrup, minced angelica, a few stoned 
cherries and a little diced orange.

ful lemon juice, a grating of nutmeg and sugar to taste. 
Let stand, covered, for two hours in the ice-box. Re- 
fill the shells and serve individually, each on a grape leaf. 
If desirable, the fruit may be chilled in an ice-cream 
freezer with one-quarter as much salt as ice. 

It should not be allowed to remain more than two hours 
as it will turn to ice. 

Fruit Soups 

Fruit soups are made of sifted, stewed fruit, sweetened, 
thickened with corn starch, arrowroot or tapioca to the 



FRUITS 155 

consistency of a cream soup, sweetened to taste while 
hot, and flavored with a dash of lemon juice, or a little 
spice. They are then chilled and served in tiny bowls, 
or bouillon cups, as appetizers, or in glasses as informal 
desserts or for the children's supper. 

General Directions for Fruit Soups 

Currants, cherries, raspberries, blueberries and grapes, 
as well as rhubarb and strawberries, may be used. As 
much water again may be added over that generally used 
in the plain stewing of fruit. A tablespoonful of corn 
starch or arrowroot, dissolved in a little cold water, should 
be used to thicken each pint of liquid. Sugar and a few 
grains of salt may be added to taste. A tablespoonful 
of pearl tapioca, or a half tablespoonful of quick tapioca, 
should be used to each cupful and a half of " soup " if 
this thickening is chosen. 

DRIED FRUITS 

During the winter months, when fresh fruits are ex- 
pensive and, in some cases, not to be obtained, the dried 
fruit fills the breach, offering in great variety the miner- 
als and acids that are necessary to sustenance. It is not 
generally known that during the process of evaporation 
all fruits undergo a slight chemical change increasing the 
amount of sugar which they contain. The reason that 
dried fruit sauces frequently taste insipid is because this 
latent sugar is entirely ignored, the sauce being sweet- 
ened until the tart fruit flavor is entirely overcome. 
Prunes, for instance, contain a large percentage of sugar, 
almost identical with cane sugar, yet the majority of 
housewives add an excess amount ,of sweetening, and 
then say that " Their family will not eat prunes." Really 
good cooking consists in developing natural flavors, and 
well-cooked dried fruits are redolent with their own de- 
liciousness. Just as lemon juice is frequently added to 
brighten fresh pineapple, or orange juice to strawberries, 
the evaporated fruits are often made more sparkling by 
the addition of other flavors. Ground cinnamon or cloves 
may be occasionally used with prunes, ginger root or 
candied ginger with pears, while orange and lemon rind 



156 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

and juice, or a little tart jelly, are additions to all varie- 
ties. 

General Directions for Cooking Dried Fruits 

The dried fruits in common winter use are pears, 
peaches, apricots, prunes, loganberries, strawberries and 
figs, while dates have a definite place in combination with 
other materials. Only the sun- or home-dried varieties 
should be used. Because of the tough skin, it is usually 
necessary to soften and cook them before they appear in 
any way. First of all, they must be washed thoroughly, 
then submerged in warm water for twelve hours in a cov- 
ered utensil. At the end of this time they will have swol- 
len to their original shape, and, although uncooked, are 
already tender. The cooking may be done in three ways 
in the double boiler, in a crock in the oven, or in the 
fireless cooker. In any case the water in which they are 
soaked serves as the liquid, the seasoning, as orange rind 
or spice, is put in at the beginning of the process; the 
liquid must not boil, and the sugar is not added until the 
last half hour. As a general rule, not less than two 
hours should be allowed for cooking prunes, apricots and 
peaches, while pears and figs are improved by three or 
four hours' time. Loganberries may be cooked in an 
hour. Like most of the dried fruits, prunes and figs are 
laxative, partly because of their coarse skin, and partly 
because of marked purgative properties.

CHAPTER IV 
CEREALS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING 
CEREALS 

In preparing cereals put the right amount of boiling 
water into the upper part of the double boiler, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt to each pint of water and, when this is 
boikng rapidly, stir in the necessary amount of cereal 
with a fork so slowly that the liquid does not stop boiling, 
for if this happens the cereal is liable to fall to the bottom 
of the utensil and the grains stick together, causing 
lumps. The cereal will have to be stirred occasionally 
during the direct cookery, which should last fifteen 
minutes. The method of cooking over the direct flame is 
used quickly to burst the grains, so that the starch may 
come at once in contact with the boiling water and receive 
its fair quota of cookery. It may then be set over the 
lower part of the double boiler containing boiling water 
and be allowed to cook the remaining time designated in 
the following table. 

If desired, the first cookery may be done at night while 
the dishes are being washed, and be finished in the morn- 
ing. If a long-time cereal is to be prepared, it may be 
entirely cooked the day before, left in the double boiler 
with the lid on to prevent the formation of crust, and, in 
the morning, a little hot water poured over the top, and 
the cereal gradually heated. When it is hot, it may be 
gently stirred with a fork and the hot water will slowly 
diffuse into the cereal, making it soft but not lumpy. 
This same process may be employed in re-heating left- 
over cereals for the next day's use.

To Blanch Rice 

Put the rice over a hot fire in a large saucepan of cold 
water and stir occasionally while it is heating. Let boil 
five minutes, then drain, and let cold water from the fau- 
cet run through it. The rice is now white and clean, and 
the grains do not stick to each other. Then proceed to 
boil as usual. However, this is a wasteful method, and 
absolutely unnecessary unless coated rice is used.

CHAPTER V 
EGGS AND SAVORY EGG DISHES 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

Egg cookery may be divided into the following general 
groups : 

1. Boiled eggs, soft and hard. 

2. Poached eggs cooked in water, stock or milk. 

3. Eggs shirred in individual dishes surrounded by hot 
water. 

4. Egg timbales, surrounded by hot water. 

5. Fried forms, including plain fried eggs, scrambled 
eggs, omelets and egg croquettes. 

6. Souffles. 

Testing Fresh Eggs 

Drop the egg carefully into a deep saucepan full of 
cold water ; if fresh, it will sink at once to the bottom ; if 
it sways about on one end, nearly upright, but still under 
water, it is not fresh, but can still be used. If, however, 
the egg promptly bobs up to the surface and floats about, 
it is spoiled. 

Terms Used in Beating Eggs 

Eggs that are slightly beaten are not separated, and are 
beaten until a spoonful can be taken up. 

Egg yolks are well-beaten when they become thick and 
lemon-colored. 

Egg whites are beaten dry when they are stiff enough 
to remain in the dish as it is turned upside down. They 
will then be dead-white in color, like newly-fallen snow. 

In beating eggs the most common utensils used are the 
wheel egg-beater, or a wire whisk. The wheel egg-beater 
costs from ten to twenty-five cents, according to the 
quality, and the whisk twenty-five cents. When beating 

170 



EGGS AND SAVORY EGG DISHES 171 

egg whites, the whisk is often employed, as it is possible to 
make the whites lighter in this way. 

Boiled Eggs 

Properly speaking eggs should not be boiled at all 
unless for hard cooking, but should be cooked by the old- 
fashioned method known as " coddling." To do this, 
put the eggs in a thick earthenware utensil, pour over 
boiling water, cover and set in a warm place, six minutes 
for soft cooking and eight for a slightly firm result. 

Hard-Boiled Eggs 

Put the eggs on in cold water, bring to boiling point, 
boil rapidly for ten minutes and then chill in cold water. 
This is the only method whereby a green ring around the 
yolk may be avoided. 

Poached Eggs 

Select a fairly deep frying pan, fill it three-fourths full 
of boiling water slightly salted, break the eggs one by one, 
gently, into a saucer and slide into the boiling water. 
Baste the yolks gently with a little of the water to co'ok 
the tops. The water should not boil after the eggs have 
been put in but should be kept merely at simmering point. 
Cook until the white is firm, then remove the eggs with a 
perforated spoon to buttered toast. Dust with salt and 
pepper and pour over a little melted butter. Eggs should 
be at least two days old to poach successfully. 

Eggs Poached in Broth 

Eggs are sometimes served in this way to reinforce an 
otherwise scanty luncheon or supper. Proceed as di- 
rected for plain poached eggs, substituting broth for the 
water. Serve the broth and eggs together in bouillon 
cups or marmites (covered earthenware cups). 

Milk Toast with Poached Eggs 

Scald the milk in a flat saucepan, add salt to taste, and 
gently break the eggs, one by one, into a saucer. Slip 
into the milk and poach as usual, taking care the milk 
does not boil. Then have ready buttered toast; set the 
eggs on it, pour over the hot milk and serve at once. 



172 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Poached Eggs on Tomato Toast 

i cupfuls sifted thick stewed 2 tablespoonfuls flour 

tomato 2 tablespoonfuls butter or 

\ tablespoonful minced onion bacon fat 

i tablespoonful minced green \ teaspoonful salt

\ cupful minced cooked ham 6 slices buttered toast 

1 teaspoonful sugar i cupful grated cheese 
6 eggs 

Fry the onions and pepper in the butter till softened. 
Add the flour and seasonings and the tomato, gradually. 
Let boil up once, strain and add the ham. While re- 
heating, poach the eggs, pour the tomato sauce over the 
toast, carefully put the eggs in place on the toast, and 
sprinkle with salt, pepper and grated cheese. 

Egg Benedict 

Allow a large round slice of buttered bread or half an 
English muffin, split, to each person. On this lay a round 
slice of broiled ham. Then place on it a poached egg. 
Coat this with Hollandaise sauce, and garnish with a bit 
of truffle or cooked mushroom. 

Asparagus Eggs 

2 cupfuls rich milk i cupful cooked asparagus 
2 tablespoonfuls flour cut in inch lengths 

2 tablespoonfuls butter 6 eggs 

i teaspoonful salt 2 tablespoonfuls grated Par- 

Few grains pepper mesan cheese 

Make a sauce of the first five ingredients. Add the 
asparagus and, when very hot, slip in the eggs very gently 
and poach, till set, over hot water. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, strew with grated cheese, and serve on buttered 
toast. 

% Plain Egg Timbales 

Butter thickly several timbale moulds, then sprinkle 
them with a finely chopped mixture of ham, cooked sau- 
sage, smoked salmon, or left-over chopped cooked ba- 
con and parsley. Very carefully break an egg into each 
mould, sprinkle tine tops with a little salt and pepper and 
set in a pan three-quarters full of boiling water. Let 
them cook gently, until firm, in a moderate oven, keeping 
the water at simmering point. It will take about fifteen 



EGGS AND SAVORY EGG DISHES 173 

minutes. Then unmould on rounds of hot buttered 
toast and serve with white or tomato sauce. 

Baked Eggs in Tomato Sauce 

2 tablespoonfuls bacon fat -2 tablespoonfuls flour 

i cupfuls strained tomato i teaspoon ful pepper 

juice i teaspoonful salt 

6 eggs 

Make a sauce of the bacon fat, flour, seasonings and 
tomato juice. Pour into an earthen baking dish ; break 
the eggs singly on a saucer, and slip into the sauce. Dust 
lightly with salt and pepper, and bake in a moderate 
oven until the eggs are set. 

Shirred Eggs 

Butter individual baking dishes, and carefully slip in 
one or two eggs, as desired. Dust lightly with salt and 
pepper, and add a bit of butter. Set the dishes in a pan 
of boiling water, and cook the eggs gently in the oven until 
they are set. It will take about ten minutes for medium- 
soft eggs. They can be cooked directly in the oven with- 
out the hot water medium in a shorter time, but they will 
not be so digestible. 

Shirred Eggs, Creole 

Heat a cupful of left-over stewed tomatoes ; add a lit- 
tle diced onion and green peppers, cooked until soft and 
yellow, and put a tablespoonful of the mixture into the 
desired number of individual ramekins. Slip the egg on 
this and bake gently, until set. It is not necessary to use 
a pan of hot water, as the liquid from the tomato will 
prevent too rapid cooking. 

Baked Eggs with Creamed Potatoes 

2 cupfuls diced potatoes \ teaspoonful pepper 

2 cupfuls milk 2 tablespoonfuls grated 
2 tablespoonfuls flour cheese 

2 tablespoonfuls butter 6 eggs 
I teaspoonful salt

sonings ; add the potatoes, and pour into a shallow, but- 
tered baking dish. Break the eggs one by one into a 
saucer and slip them carefully upon the mixture; sprin- 



174 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

kle lightly with salt and pepper and cheese and set in a 
moderate oven to cook. Serve when the eggs are " set," 
which will be in about ten minutes. 

Baked Eggs and Mashed Potatoes 
Oil a shallow earthen dish with bacon fat. Fill almost 
full with mashed potatoes, well seasoned. Make inden- 
tations in the potato, pour in a little melted bacon fat, and 
brush the top of the mixture with it. Drop an egg into 
each hollow and set in the oven to bake until the eggs are 
set and the potato is browned.

pour over the eggs a rich white sauce, into which has been 
stirred the olives, minced. 

Stuffed Eggs with Ham 

Hard cook the eggs, remove the shells and cut the eggs 
into halves lengthwise. Scoop out the yolks, mash and 
measure and mix with it half the amount of ham minced 
very fine, melted butter to moisten, and made-mustard, 
salt and pepper to season. Pack the stuffing back into the 
eggs, press the halves together in pairs, roll in thin waxed 
paper and twist the ends like bon-bon papers to hold them 
firmly in position. Use the balance of the stuffing as a 
sandwich filling. 

Stuffed eggs can be varied in a great many ways; al- 
most any cooked meat, smoked fish, sardines, canned fish, 
or cheese, with a high seasoning of tabasco, Worcester- 
shire, catsup, etc., being suitable.

i cupful milk i teaspoonful butter or olive 

1 teaspoonfnl salt oil 

Beat the egg in a double boiler top, add the other ingre- 
dients, and cook over boiling water until solidified 
about ten minutes stirring occasionally very gently to 
allow the uncooked portion from the center to get to the 
edges. This is especially good for children or invalids. 

Spanish Eggs 

6 eggs i teaspoonful sugar

Fried Eggs 

For frying eggs, keep a pan for that purpose only. 
Heat it and put in enough fat (bacon, ham, sausage or 
beef, or butter if you have nothing better) barely to cover 
the bottom. Break the eggs one by one into a saucer, 
slip into the fat, salt and pepper lightly, and fry slowly 
until of the desired firmness, removing carefully to a 
heated platter with a griddle cake turner. 



OMELETS 

There are two classes of omelets, the French and the 
Puffy, and whereas these are capable of infinite variety 
all omelets may be included under these two heads. All 
omelets should have a certain per cent, of liquid added to 
them. The general proportion of liquid to an egg is a 
tablespoonful; either hot or cold water or milk, may be 
used. However, there are times when it is necessary to 
make eggs go as far as possible, and in this case a fourth 



178 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

of a cupful of milk, and a fourth of a tablespoonful of 
flour may be allowed for each egg or a fourth of a cup- 
ful of White Sauce No. 2 may be used. 

Old-time authorities say that the success of an omelet 
is largely dependent upon the number of egg yolks that 
are used, and that they should number a third more than 
the whites to insure a tender result. This is undoubtedly 
true in a measure, and when convenient it is a good plan 
to add an extra yolk or two because they are rich in fat ; 
however, this is by no means necessary, if the omelet is 
properly cooked. Baking powder is not needed. 

General Directions for Making Omelets 
The omelet pan should be thoroughly clean. To an 
omelet of medium size allow a tablespoonful of the de- 
sired fat butter, bacon, or ham fat, giving a good selec- 
tion. Melt this fat in the omelet pan, and tip the pan so 
that it is thoroughly oiled, sides and all, but do not let the 
fat get very hot. Then pour in the omelet mixture and 
let it cook gently, lifting the mixture occasionally with a 
spatula or broad-bladed knife, so that the uncooked liquid 
portion may precipitate. When this has been done, allow 
it to brown on the bottom, and, if possible, set it in the 
oven for a moment to make the top firm. Cut at right 
angles to the handle, fold over and slip out onto a hot 
platter. If a special flavoring is to be introduced, it may 
be spread upon half of the omelet before it is folded and 
turned out. 

If an omelet has to stand some time before serving, 
choose one of the puffy varieties that contains flour. 
Various types of omelet are suitable for service at the 
different meals. Generally speaking, however, it is good 
form to serve very simple omelets at breakfast, as plain 
French or puffy omelet with a bit of bacon or ham, reserv- 
ing the more savory omelets for luncheon or supper. 
Sweet omelets may act as dessert at luncheon, or as the 
main course at luncheon or supper, if desired, although 
this is a little unusual. 

Variations of Plain Omelets 

Plain, Puffy, French and Swedish Omelets may be 
varied by means of sauces in a great many ways, and at 
the same time in connection with some left-over they may

SOUFFLES 

Souffles or, as the name means, " puffed ups " are 
properly speaking baked omelets, in which the eggs have 
been beaten separately, the air, which has been incorpor- 
ated into the whites, being used to puff up the dish. 
True souffles will not stand any time after taking from 
the oven, and so must be served at once, unless they are 
reinforced with bread crumbs, flour or some other starchy 
element. 

Souffles may be divided into two classes, savory 
souffles and sweet souffles. 

The simplest form of a savory souffle is called baked 
omelet, or omelet souffle. Other souffles may be made by 
combining the eggs, with a certain percentage of thickened 
sauce and other ingredients, as, for instance, y 2 cupful 
White Sauce No. 3, 3 eggs, and 2 cupfuls of minced meat, 
vegetables or fish with suitable seasonings. If this pro- 
portion is kept in mind, many a left-over can be made into 
a suitable luncheon or supper dish with the additional 
expense only of the eggs. 

General Directions for Cooking Souffles 

Whenever possible, souffles should be baked in indi- 
vidual glass or earthenware dishes which are well-oiled, 
as they are usually made very heavy by the cutting of the 
spoon when served from a large dish. The dishes should 
be well rubbed with butter, oleomargarine or bacon fat 
and should be filled half-full, as the souffle, if properlv 
made, should rise to double its bulk. Individual dishes 
should be baked in a moderate oven for fifteen mjntites, 
and dishes holding enough to serve six should be baked 
for thirty minutes. When done the center will feel dry 
and firm, like sponge or angel cake.

CHAPTER VI 
YEAST BREADS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

What constitutes good white bread? On this point 
authorities differ, but they are agreed that it should be 
baked till the crumb, or inner part, becomes light in tex- 
ture, a little moist, but not soggy ; that it should be nutty 
and agreeable both to smell and taste ; that it should be 
light in color and evenly porous; and that the surface 
should be elastic enough to rebound when pressed. The 
loaf should rise evenly and not burst at either top or 
sides. It should be of uniform, golden-brown color, but 
the texture of the crust depends upon whether a milk or 
water bread is made. Bread is not good if it tastes or 
smells sour, and the crumb of white bread should not be 
dark in color. If these requirements are not met, there 
is something wrong in the way it is mixed, tended or 
baked, or with the yeast, flour or formula. 

The Yeast 

The first important thing is the yeast. This is made 
up of minute plants, the success of the finished loaf de- 
pending upon their proper growth ; and just as you coddle 
your rubber plant or Boston fern, the yeast plants must 
be nurtured until they have grown sufficiently. This may 
be judged by the amount the bread has risen. The 
growth of yeast, and, therefore, the rising of bread, de- 
mands close attention to temperature. Sudden chill is 
disastrous to yeast, the growth of which is checked by a 
radical drop in temperature. On the other hand, too 
great heat also causes unsatisfactory results, because at 
any temperature above ninety-five, various undesired or- 
ganisms are sure to develop, which will give the bread a 
sour flavor. The proper temperature for the growth of 
yeast is from seventy to ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. 

188 



YEAST BREADS 189 

In summer lower temperature is preferable, while in win- 
ter, when the flour is cold, higher may be used. 

Use of the Thermometer 

Many women say that they buy baker's bread because 
it is consistently good. The reason for this is that the 
baker always uses exact measurements, and fermentation 
is produced at a temperature regulated by the ther- 
mometer. There is no reason why every housekeeper 
should not use a thermometer in making bread as well as 
in preparing other foods. The woman who puts her bread 
to rise on the radiator, for instance, will find that the tem- 
perature will register from a hundred and fifty to two 
hundred degrees, and only somewhat lower if a wooden 
board is placed beneath the pan. If the bread is put next 
the radiator, it becomes too hot on one side, unless turned 
frequently, and if put on the back of the stove when the 
fire is at all hot, the heat is again directed unevenly. In 
hot weather the rising generally takes care of itself, but 
the only accurate method that I have ever found for win- 
ter use is to raise the bread over warm water. The 
dough should be placed in an enamelware bowl which fits 
over the top of a large stock-pot. The pot should then 
be filled with water at a hundred degrees, just full enough 
so that the enamelware pan touches the water when set in 
the pot. A lid is then placed over the dough and the 
whole set in the fireless cooker. Or if a fireless cooker is 
not at hand, the dough may be kept in a warm place just 
the same if the water is changed two or three times dur- 
ing the rising process. 

How to Use Compressed Yeast 

Compressed yeast is very inexpensive and produces uni- 
form results. However, to do good work it must be 
fresh, and should be of an even, light sand color with no 
dark streaks ; it should break crisply ; if there is any doubt 
about its freshness it should be dropped into a third cup- 
ful of tepid water, containing a tablespoonful of sugar. 
If fresh, bubbles will come at once to the surface. If 
they do not, the yeast should not be used. As compressed 
yeast works more rapidly than dry yeast, and as bread can 
be made from it with most excellent results without first 



190 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

making a sponge, it is the most satisfactory kind to use 
when one is near a market and can buy it fresh whenever 
wanted. Still, if placed in cold water, compressed yeast 
may be kept a few days in the ice-box, or may be buried 
in salt, and kept in a cool place. 

How to Use Dry Yeast 

Those who live at some distance from the grocery will 
probably find it more satisfactory to use dry yeast. This 
is made of a strong stock yeast, thickened with cornmeal 
and dried at a low temperature to prevent fermentation. 
The strength is somewhat variable, as the yeast plants 
gradually die, so, contrary to customary use, the supply 
of dry yeast should be renewed frequently in order to 
keep the bread results uniform. In using dry yeast the 
bread should always be started with a sponge; the dry 
cake should be dissolved in a small amount of tepid water, 
then added to the desired amount of lukewarm liquid, and 
enough flour to make a soft batter beaten in, about a cup- 
ful and a half to a pint of the liquid. When it has risen 
till light, the remaining flour and the other ingredients 
may be added. The bread recipes in this book have been 
standardized for compressed yeast, but dry yeast may be 
substituted if this method is used. When strictest econ- 
omy must be practised, dry yeast is much less expensive 
when transformed into liquid yeast. In using this allow 
half a cupful to each pint of liquid to be used in making 
the bread. 

Varieties of Bread 

Bread may be made in such infinite variety that it 
seems a great waste of opportunity to confine it wholly to 
the usual " white bread." The latter has a definite place 
in the dietary, if it is used as a starch, rather than a pro- 
tein or mineral food, but white bread is a decidedly un- 
stable " staff of life " if used alone. On the other hand 
many of the so-called wheat flours, although highly ad- 
vertised, are little better, because a large part of the wheat 
has also been removed from them. When a real whole- 
wheat flour or meal can be obtained one made of un- 
denatured or unrobbed wheat bread becomes more than 
a starch ; it is a true nerve, blood and bone food. At the 



YEAST BREADS 191 

same time it is particularly rich in vitamins, the life-giv- 
ing principles. 

Bran bread also has a place in the diet, for it brings 
bulk to help overcome constipation and minerals as a 
nerve tonic. Moreover, bran bread at least twenty-four 
hours old, toasted until crisp, will be found an excellent 
substitute for white bread toast to be used 1 by those 
troubled with obesity. Rye bread is easily made and is 
a good alternative for whole-wheat bread. Rice bread, 
made of brown rice, is substantial, and offers splendid 
nutritive properties, especially if combined with raisins or 
dates. Rice bread, of uncoated or brown rice and white 
flour, is an excellent starch food, and bread of unrobbed 
cornmeal, whether in the form of raised brown bread or 
in combination with whole-wheat flour and nuts, is a re- 
markable protein, starch and nerve food. However, in 
making breads of rice and these various meals, it is neces- 
sary for best results to use a little white or whole-wheat 
flour. The proportion may be varied as desired, but it 
should never be less than one-fourth.. 

White flour is sifted a multitude of times at the mill 
until it is of the desired fineness, the husks are discarded 
as bran, and the heart, which contains most of the fat, is 
sold a's shorts or middlings. Each of these products is a 
valuable food for farm stock, the animals being kept in 
fine condition on what we discard. Undoubtedly one rea- 
son white flour is so popular with the American housewife 
is because it keeps longer than flour made with the whole 
grain. Any honest miller who grinds up the whole of the 
grain will not guarantee the flour to keep more than three 
weeks, as the large amount of fat which it contains is 
liable to cause rancidity. It is, therefore, necessary to 
renew the supply of cornmeal or whole-wheat meal fre- 
quently. 

Another reason whole-wheat bread and those made of 
allied, unrobbed flours are not more frequently used is that 
modern housewives are not acquainted with the proper 
methods of making them and because they are disap- 
pointed in the slightly coarse texture which is liable to 
result. This coarseness is really of advantage, as it 
makes possible quicker access of the digestive juices, and 
thus hasten digestion. 



192 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Flour for White Bread-Making 

The best flour for white bread-making is that made 
from spring wheat as it contains a large proportion of 
gluten which makes the dough more elastic than when 
pastry or winter-wheat flour is used. At the same time a 
little less flour is needed and the loaf is whiter. Winter- 
wheat or 'pastry flour contains more starch and is fre- 
quently less strong; that is, it does not have equivalent 
elastic powers. Bread flour is slightly granular ; pastry 
flour is more solid and cakes when pressed in the hand. 

Comparison Between Baker's and Home-Made Bread 

Many housewives contend that it is cheaper to buy 
baker's bread than to make white bread at home. On the 
contrary, I make two loaves of bread for four and a half 
cents each for materials when flour is at a normal figure. 
These loaves are as heavy as those costing ten cents 
apiece at the baker's. This leaves a margin of eleven 
cents over the cost of baker's bread for the fuel and labor 
of baking. As I always bake a pan of apples, a loaf of 
gingerbread, or some other food demanding the same 
temperature along with the bread, the fuel cost is neg- 
ligible. However, if baked alone about two cents' worth 
of gas would be used to each loaf. If baked in a coal 
range the cost cannot be computed, as the fire is always 
lighted. 

In a family of six, where there are .four children, an 
average of about nine loaves of bread a week will be eaten 
if the bread is home-made. This will cost at the utmost 
forty-five cents. If baker's bread is provided, more will 
be required, but even if it were not, the cost of the bread 
would be ninety cents, or forty-five cents more than when 
the bread is home-made. 

How to Use the Bread Mixer 

A good bread mixer should be one of the first acquisi- 
tions of a new household, and among the first purchases 
for the household already established. I know no one 
article, which, for the expenditure involved, will save as 
much time, strength, and nervous energy as a good bread 
mixer. Then top, the bread will be exactly as good, and 
probably more uniform than if kneaded by hand. In 



YEAST BREADS 193 

making plain white, or whole-wheat, bread, pour in the 
warm water or milk, add the shortening, sweetening and 
salt, and the yeast dissolved in tepid water. The flour is 
then added all at once, exactly three times as much as 
there is liquid, and the handle of the mixer is turned for 
three minutes. It takes only about six minutes to mix 
up two loaves of bread, and there is nothing to be cleaned 
up afterward! At the same time less flour is needed than 
by the old method. After the bread has risen, cut it down 
and form it into loaves with the least possible handling, 
not even using a bread-board, but shaping it with the 
floured hands. In starting a rich bread like coffee cake, 
which needs a sponge, whip up the sponge in a bowl, using 
a heavy wire whisk, pour it into the bread mixer, and, 
when it has risen, add the flour and other ingredients. If 
the weather is very cold, set the pail of the bread mixer 
in a warm water bath, as described above. 

How to Make a Sponge 

Two kinds of sponge are used in making yeast-mix- 
tures. The first is made up of the milk or water specified 
in the recipe, the proper amount of yeast dissolved in a 
little warm water, and twice as much flour as liquid. In 
the second the yeast is softened in a little water, and 
enough flour is stirred into this to make a soft dough ; this 
is kneaded and dropped into the warm liquid which is to 
be used in mixing the bread. When this ball of dough 
rises to the top of the liquid, the rest of the ingredients 
may be added. 

General Proportions for a Loaf of Bread 

If bread is to be set over night, a fourth of a com- 
pressed yeast cake is allowed to each loaf. If it is to be 
set in the early morning and baked about two in the 
afternoon, a half of a compressed yeast cake should be 
allowed to each loaf. A cupful of milk or water, a 
fourth cupful of water in which the yeast should be dis- 
solved, a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoon ful of butter, 
drippings, lard or oleomargarine, and a tablespoonful of 
sugar, with from three to four cupfuls of flour are the 
proper proportions for one loaf of bread. If a slightly 
tough bread is desired, omit the shortening. Milk pro- 



i 9 4 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

duces bread of finer texture than water, but bread of the 
latter keeps moist longer than that of the former. 

Many authorities feel that bread should rise several 
times to secure the best flavor. Personally I find that 
excellent results may be obtained with two risings for 
bread, and only three for rolls, coffee cake and the like. 

Baking Bread 

Undoubtedly one of the reasons bread is not properly 
baked is because the process is often hurried. Loaves of 
pound proportions should bake in forty-five minutes to 
an hour in an oven at 375 F. for the first three-quarters 
of the time. Biscuits and rolls need a hotter oven, about 
400 F. at first, baking in about twenty-five minutes. 
During the first quarter of the time the bread will rise 
somewhat and will color slightly in spots. During the 
second quarter it will brown delicately. During the third 
quarter the baking is almost done, the last quarter being 
needed only to dry out the moisture, when the heat should 
be lowered. Bread is done when it shrinks away from 
the pan, can be tipped out on the hand, and held without 
burning, and when it sounds hollow if tapped. Even the 
shape and size of the pan affects the quality of the bread. 
If too deep, the bread will be coarse and soggy, if too 
shallow and wide, it is liable to. be dark and the crust very 
brittle. Round pans should not be used. The best size 
is seven and a half inches long by four and a quarter 
inches wide, and three inches deep. 

Treatment of the Finished Loaf 

To produce a teader crust, rub the warm loaf with a 
little butter or oleomargarine. To produce a crisp crust, 
beat up a little egg white and brush over the loaf when 
almost done. To produce a very soft crust, make a paste 
of a teaspoonful of corn starch dissolved in a little cold 
water and cook in half a cupful of boiling water for a 
few minutes. Apply this with a pastry brush shortly 
before the bread is done. If the bread is to be sprinkled 
with sugar, or sugar, nuts and cinnamon, dredge these 
over the paste before returning it to the oven, so that they 
will literally cook on. When bread is done, it should 
never be turned into a cloth and covered while cooling, as 



YEAST BREADS 195 

this affects the flavor and makes the loaf soggy. A wire 
cake-rack, which allows a free circulation of air, should 
be used instead. A stone jar is the best utensil in which 
to store the bread. However, cut slices and bits of loaves 
should be kept in a separate closed utensil, as they fur- 
nish an excellent surface for the growth of mold. 

Bread, or spring wheat flour, gives the best results in 
the following recipes. 

Salt-Rising Bread 

4 tablespoonfuls white corn- i teaspoon fnl salt 

meal i teaspoonftil sugar 

Boiling new milk Bread flour to knead 
i pint tepid water 

Scald the white cornmeal with the boiling new milk to a 
thick batter, and set in a warm place to rise over night. 
In the morning it should be somewhat light. To this 
sponge add the warm water, the salt and sugar, and 
thicken with flour to a medium sponge. Set this in a 
warm water bath, and keep the same temperature until 
raised light. It will be necessary to change the water 
occasionally. Keep it near the stove if possible. When 
it is light enough, add flour to knead. Shape at once into 
loaves, and when double in bulk bake as usual.

when lukewarm, add the yeast dissolved in the tepid 
water. Stir in flour to make a stiff batter and knead till 
elastic. Place in a well-oiled bowl; wipe over the top 
with a little melted fat so that a crust will not form, and 
let rise until double in bulk. Form into loaves, let rise 
again, until nearly double, and bake forty-five to fifty 
minutes in a moderate oven. A half pound of seeded 
raisins may be added to the dough if desired.

combine with the whole amount of liquid and beat in two 
cupfuls of the flour. Let stand in a warm place until 



YEAST BREADS 197 

spongy, about an hour and a half. Then add the sugar, 
salt and the shortening, melted, and beat in the remain- 
ing flour. If necessary, add more flour until the mixture 
is thick enough to knead. Knead until elastic, let rise 
till double in bulk, shape into loaves, and, when light, bake 
in a moderate oven from fifty minutes to an hour. 

Unkneaded Rye Bread (5 Hours) 

2 cupfuls rye meal 2 cupfuls .water or milk, in- 
2 cupfuls bread flour eluding wetting for yeast

i compressed yeast cake ter or drippings 

Sift together the dry ingredients; add the liquid, which 
should be tepid, yeast and shortening. Mix well, place 
in well-oiled bread pans, let rise till double in bulk and 
bake forty-five minutes in a moderate oven. This makes 
one large or two small loaves. If started at eight o'clock, 
it can be finished by one.

Dissolve the yeast in the water, and add a cupful of 
flour ; let rise until light and spongy, then add the shorten- 
ing, melted, the sugar, salt and the milk slightly warmed. 
In the meantime the rice should be cooked until very soft, 
but not really wet, and should be rubbed through a sieve 
into the sponge. Work in flour to knead about 4 cup- 
fuls. Cut down and shape into two loaves ; let rise till 
light again, and bake forty-five minutes in a moderate 
oven.

ing and salt. When tepid, add the yeast dissolved in the 
water, and beat in flour to knead. If desired, a cupful 
of chopped raisins, figs, or dates may be added at this 
time. .Knead thoroughly, form into two loaves, let rise 
till double in bulk, and bake in a moderate oven. The 
bread will be coarse-grained, but of nutty flavor, and the 
use of the meal effects considerable saving of flour. 

Cinnamon Loaf 

Reserve some of the dough from plain white bread. 
Oil a square cake pan and spread one-half the mixture 
into the tin. Sprinkle with 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
and i l /2 teaspoonfuls cinnamon mixed together; dot with

oven to set the glaze and finish cooking. 

WAYS TO USE STALE BREAD 

" It's only a slice of bread," we say as we scrape it 
into the waste can, but most housewives do not know that 
a generous sized slice is approximately equal in caloric 
value to a saucerful of rice, a small handful of almonds, 
a good-sized cube of cheese, an egg, a cupful of a nourish- 
ing stock or vegetable soup, a dozen oysters, a serving of 
codfish, or a slice of lean beef ! 

It does not seem as though much was being wasted 
when we throw away the crusts from sandwiches, or the 
end of the loaf, but when we realize that a single slice of 
bread wasted every day in every home in America, totals 
625,000 Ibs. a day, at a national cost of $50,000 daily, we 
can see that in that one item alone, a great deal of money 
can be saved. 

In preparing crumbs the bread should be dried in a slow 
oven, then put through the medium-sized knife of the 
food chopper. 



210 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Whole wheat and rye bread crumbs should be kept 
separate for use in escalloping meats and vegetables and 
in thickening soups. White bread crumbs may be used 
for escallops, fish loaves, etc., where a more dainty flavor 
is desired, as well as for crumbing croquettes, and in mak- 
ing puddings, etc., while crumbs from sweet breads may 
be used in escalloping fruits and in making puddings and 
fritters. 

In utilizing buttered toast or bread, keep it separate 
from the unbuttered slices, as the extra fat is liable to 
make the crumbs turn stale within a few days. The 
crumbs should be stored in jars with perforated tops, 
which will prevent rancidity and staleness. 

Bread Breakfast Cereal 

3 ctipfuls broken bits dried 3 cupfuls boiling water 
white bread, or equal parts teaspoonful salt 
of white and whole wheat 
bread 

Boil gently for ten minutes, stirring with a wire whisk 
or fork. Serve with milk and sugar. 

Bread and Nut Cereal 

Steamed brown bread (stale) Chopped nut meats 

Dry the brown bread thoroughly and then grind into 
coarse crumbs. Add one- fourth as many nut meats and 
serve with milk and a little salt, as the main dish for a 
simple luncheon or supper. Serve plain without nut- 
meats for breakfast.

i quart water 

Combine the vegetables, tomato and water and cook 
gently until the vegetables are tender, about an hour, re- 
plenishing the water to keep the amount as at first. Rub 
through a sieve, add the fat and crusts and simmer gently 
for ten minutes, stirring with a whisk, then season to 
taste.

half inch squares, and fry lightly in butter or oleomar- 
garine, or toast in a hot oven. Serve with soups. 



CHAPTER VII 
QUICK BREADS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

There is almost no type of cookery in which there are 
so many failures as in the making, of quick breads, and 
yet there is no food that ought to be more carefully made 
because it is generally served at breakfast when the di- 
gestive organs are not yet toned up. If the hot bread 
is not properly cooked, and therefore easily assimilated, 
it is frequently the cause of indigestion. 

It is by no means necessary to be glued to a recipe 
in this regard, if one can keep in mind the general 
proportions of liquid, baking powder, flour and shorten- 
ing for making breads of this type. Generally speaking 
these proportions are as follows : 

Griddle Cakes. Two-thirds as much liquid as flour ; 
a teaspoonful of baking powder to each cup of flour ; a 
tablespoonful or less of butter or other shortening to each 
pint of liquid and one or two eggs to three cupfuls of 
flour. 

Muffins. The general proportions are: A cupful of 
milk, 2 cupfuls of flour, 3 teaspoonfuls baking powder, 
and from one to three tablespoonfuls of shortening. 

Sour Milk Muffins. Observe the above general pro- 
portions substituting a half teaspoonful of soda for 'each 
cupful of sour milk, buttermilk, or sour cream. If the 
milk is not very sour, it may be neutralized by the addi- 
tion of one-fourth teaspoonful of soda, and baking pow- 
der may be added to the mixture in two-thirds the usual 
quantity. 

Baking Powder Biscuits. The general proportions are 
half as much liquid as flour, from one to two tablespoon- 
fuls of shortening to each cup of flour and two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder to each cupful of flour. 

218 



QUICK BREADS 219 

In adding any grain or meal to a plain muffin recipe, 
use f cupful in place of a cupful of the flour. The liquid 
may remain the same as indicated, as the grain will swell 
enough to take it up. Sugar and salt may be added as 
desired, but a word must be said for the unsweetened, or 
simply slightly sweetened, breakfast bread. We Ameri- 
cans are liable to demand a cake rather than a bread, 
and then wonder why we are conscious of the existence 
of that organ called the liver ! 

Baking Quick Breads 

The oven should be hot (375 degrees F.) for all baking 
powder biscuit mixtures and all muffins. Popovers need 
a slow oven (about 300 degrees F.) to allow for the full 
expansion of the air which is the only leavening agent. 
Quick loaf breads demand a heat of 350 degrees F. which 
should be greatly lessened during the last quarter of the 
baking time. 

The pans should be slightly warmed and very well oiled 
with lard or beef drippings. 

Steaming Quick Breads 

Moulds the size of pound baking powder cans should 
be steamed an hour and a half. Large moulds, the size 
of a three-pound lard pail, should be steamed four hours. 
Always start the mould with the water cold and bring 
gradually to boiling point so that the mixture will heat 
evenly throughout. Count the steaming from the time 
that the water commences to boil. 

Cooking Griddle Cakes 

If possible, use an aluminum or soapstone griddle, or 
even one of steel and do not oil it, simply rub it off oc- 
casionally with a bag containing salt. Cakes baked in 
this way are light and digestible. However, if a fried 
flavor is especially liked, the griddle may be oiled easily 
by means of a swab or cloth tied onto a skewer. Drip- 
pings, lard, or bacon fat may be used, or any of the veg- 
etable oils, but butter or oleomargarine burn too quickly 
to be adopted. 

Mix the griddle cake mixture in a pitcher and pour 
out to the desired size on the griddle, which should be 



220 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

almost smoking hot. Test the ungreased griddle with a 
bit of the dough. The cakes are ready to turn when 
they are full of bubbles. They should be turned only 
once. 

Choice of Ingredients for Quick Breads 
Always use bread flour; butter or oleomargarine may 
be used interchangeably. Bacon fat may be used in corn- 
meal and gingerbread mixtures, while drippings or lard 
may be introduced in any recipe if desired, although the 
flavor will not be quite so good. Skimmed milk may be 
used instead of whole milk, but in this case the shorten- 
ing should be increased three-fourths of a tablespoonful. 
The baking powder may be either a phosphate or a cream 
of tartar powder. An alum powder has no place in any 
household. 

Baking Powder Biscuits 

2 cupfuls bread flour 2 tablespoon! uls butter, oleo- 

4 teaspoonfuls baking pow- margarine or drippings

cutter, tucking under the edges so that there will be no 
" remnants," place on a well-oiled pan with the edges 
scarcely touching and bake about fifteen minutes in a 
quick oven. 

Quick Cinnamon Rolls 

Follow the recipe for Baking Powder Biscuits, patting 
the mixture into oblong shape ; spread lightly with melted 
butter or oleomargarine, sprinkle with a half cupful of 
sugar, mixed with a teaspoonful of cinnamon, roll up, cut 
in crosswise slices like a jelly roll, and bake in a quick 
oven. 

Orange Roll Biscuits 

Follow the recipe for Baking Powder Biscuits. Pat 
the mixture into oblong shape, spread lightly with melted 
butter, and strew over one-fourth cupful of granulated 
sugar and a half cupful of finely-chopped, candied orange 
peel. Roll up as in making Quick Cinnamon Rolls, cut

CHAPTER VIII 
APPETIZERS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL . 

The success of a " company " meal depends largely 
upon the accessories; hors d'ceuvres, or relishes, and 
dainty appetizers are to a luncheon or dinner like the 
trimming to a dress, retrieving the plainness and lending 
an artistic finish that the finest meal cannot attain if 
they are omitted. Unfortunately, most housewives have 
the impression that caviar, anchovy paste and other ex- 
pensive ingredients are needed to prepare these tidbits, 
but in reality the most ordinary materials, skilfully com- 
bined, are quite as savory, and much more acceptable 
because they have the home touch. Whereas there is no 
appreciable difference between hors d'oeuvres and rel- 
ishes, the more elaborate types like canapes, fish cock- 
tails, or raw oysters are used to begin a meal, other 
simpler types, like fringed celery and stuffed olives, be- 
ing passed between the courses. 

The appetizers used to commence a meal are as fol- 
lows: Grapefruit, fruit cups, raw oysters, or clams, 
fish cocktails, vegetable cocktails and hot or cold can- 
apes. As a general rule, it may be said that the fruit, 
fruit cups and vegetable cocktails are more suitable to 
warm weather meals, canapes, and the various fish ap- 
petizers being more adaptable to the colder months. 

Canapes should be served on small plates covered 
with doilies. A dessert or ramekin fork should be pro- 
vided for the service. Raw oysters, or clams, on the 
shell should be served on beds of shaved ice in deep 
plates with a garnish of lemon points, radish roses or 
with a wine glassful of a suitable sauce in the center of 
each plate. Tiny sandwiches should be passed with them. 
Fish cocktails may be served in wine glasses, or in cups

CHAPTER IX 
SOUPS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

CREAM SOUPS 

The making of a cream soup may be an arduous task, 
or but the work of a few moments. If one starts every 
time with raw materials, cream soups will be events, rather 
than everyday occurrences. But it is, after all, but a 
step from white sauce to cream soup. The latter is made 
up of a combination of white sauce, with half the quan- 
tity of vegetable puree, that is, sifted, cooked vegetable 
pulp, plus a little of the vegetable liquid, water, or soup 
stock. Occasionally, cream soups are made which con- 
tain finely minced veal, chicken, cooked chestnuts, or 
fish, instead of a vegetable. 

There is no greater aid to forehandedness in the 
kitchen than to cook part of the food one day for the 
next; in preparing vegetables, for instance, enough may 
always be prepared so that there will be some on hand for 
a cream soup for the next day's luncheon. Nearly all 
vegetables, even pumpkin and squash, may be used in 
this way. Some of the liquor in which they are cooked 
should always be reserved, if possible. But if it is not, a 
little water may be added, together with the desired sea- 
sonings, and the whole sifted and combined with the right 
amount of cream sauce, made in the proportion of one 
tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, one- 
third teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth teaspoonful of pep- 
per, and one cupful of milk. 

The usual allowance of soup for each person is a scant 
three-fourth's cupful. With this general proportion it is 
an easy matter to calculate the amount needed for any 
number of people. In many cases the left-over vege- 
tables will be improved by twenty minutes further cook- 

240 



SOUPS 241 

ing in water or their own liquor, since in order to make 
really good cream soup they must be so soft that they 
will pass easily through a sieve. However, in making 
cream of asparagus, or celery soup, very little of the pulp 
can be rubbed through, as it is so fibrous. In many 
cases it is possible to prepare the vegetable stock for a 
cream soup two days before it is to be used, provided, of 
course, that there is a cool place in which to keep it. 
There may be on hand the tips from a bunch of celery, 
the outer leaves from a head of lettuce, or the tough ends 
from a bunch of asparagus. Any one of these will form 
the vegetable foundation for a cream soup, but possibly 
this will not fit into the next day's menu. In this case 
they should be cooked until tender, a little salt added to 
the liquor, strained, poured into a glass jar, covered and 
used later. Many a valuable bit of food is given to the 
chickens, or finds its way into the garbage can, just be- 
cause one fails to look ahead. 

Properly speaking, cream soups should always contain 
sifted vegetables, meats or fish, but they are more " fill- 
ing," if occasionally the vegetable is chopped fine, or put 
through the food chopper, and allowed to remain in the 
soup, as with onions, watercress, green corn, or spinach. 
This should not be done, however, if the soup is to be the 
first course of a well-conducted meal, while peas and lima 
beans must always be sifted, as, otherwise, the flavor will 
not be propery distributed. Corn starch or arrowroot, 
as well as tapioca, may be used to thicken cream soups, 
although flour gives the most satisfactory flavor. In 
using the two former, the same method in making the 
white sauce may be followed as with the flour, but if 
tapioca is used it should be allowed to cook in a double 
boiler with the milk until clear, the length of time de- 
pending upon whether the old-fashioned pearl or quick- 
cooking tapioca is used. The proper proportion is one 
tablespoonful of pearl tapioca or one-half tablespoonful 
of quick tapioca to each cupful of soup. In case it is 
advisable to enrich the soup, it may be poured upon 
beaten egg yolks, or slightly-beaten eggs. If these are to 
act as thickening agents the soup should be placed in a 
double boiler, returned to the heat, and stirred for two or 
three minutes. In using canned vegetables for soup- 



242 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

making the liquor should be discarded, whenever possible, 
as this may impart a " canned " taste to the soup, but 
it should be replaced by the same amount of water. If 
the milk is a little old, also in case of tomatoes and as- 
paragus, a few grains of baking soda should be added to 
the cooked vegetables before combining with the white 
sauce. A small amount of cream, or undiluted evapor- 
ated milk, may be added for richness. Croutons, toasted 
crackers, hot, buttered toast-sticks of either graham or 
white bread, heated whole wheat. or oatmeal crackers and 
pulled bread are all suitable accompaniments to a cream 
soup. Occasionally it is advisable to add a little extra fat 
to the menu, and this may be done in the form of a 
whipped cream garnish for the soup. 

PUREES AND BISQUES 

Purees, properly speaking, are made from heavy vege- 
tables, like dried beans, dried peas, and, occasionally, 
from potatoes and chestnuts. The vegetables must be 
simmered in water or stock until tender. In case of dried 
beans or peas this will take from four to five hours. 
The pulp is then sifted and returned to the liquor, and 
the whole is thickened with butter, oleomargarine, drip- 
pings or other fat and flour, which have been creamed to- 
gether. The puree, before thickening, should be almost 
as thick again as a cream soup, therefore it is necessary 
to add but little thickening. 

In making bisques the fish should be cooked in water 
or stock from twenty to thirty minutes; if oysters or 
clams are used they should be cooked in their own liquor 
for three minutes ; the seasoning should then be added, 
the right amount of hot stock or milk combined with the 
fish, and the whole should be thickened with butter or 
other fat and flour rubbed together. A few crackers or 
dry bread crumbs may be added to bisques for thickening 
if desired. 

CLEAR SOUPS 

Any dinner is greatly improved by the addition of a 
hot, clear soup, plain or containing a little spaghetti, rice, 
or a few mixed vegetables, or even left-over shredded 
lettuce leaves, or finely-shredded cabbage. 



SOUPS 243 

The best type of soup to use as a stimulant is one of 
those which has a meat-stock foundation. However, 
these soups must not be confused in food value with 
heavy chowders or cream soups, and should be classed 
as accessories instead of foods. Many people object to 
these soups on the ground that " they are just so much 
water/' while, as a matter of fact, they are stimulating, 
and if well-seasoned become indispensable. The foun- 
dation of them is a soup stock, and whereas this can be 
made from soup bones, a little meat and a few vegetables, 
it can also be made from scraps which accumulate about 
the house and which can be put into the stock-pot. 

When the weather grows warmer, it is inadvisable to 
keep a stock-pot going unless one has a cool place in 
which to store the stock, and unless the family is large, 
for stock made from a mixture of foods should not be 
kept more than two days. Of course, if there are some 
chicken bones on hand, the trimmings and bones from 
lamb chops, or other scraps of meat and bone, they may 
be combined with a little onion, some celery tips or seed, 
some mixed whole spice, and made into soup-stock to be 
used within a short time, but, barring this, the house- 
keeper with a small family must rely upon meat extracts, 
or bouillon cubes, with a well-made white or brown soup 
stock for occasional use. 

If carefully seasoned, the meat used in making 
stock may be used in rechaufees or salads. The de- 
sired vegetables should be added from day to day, 
for if they are added when the stock is first made, 
it will not keep well. Add the vegetables raw or 
cooked, or the combination of vegetables to be served in 
the soup, to one-fourth as much water as there is to be 
soup. If it happens to be raw cabbage, it should be 
rapidly boiled for ten minutes; if raw celery, onions, 
green pepper, or carrots, thirty-five minutes, the water 
being replenished as fast as it boils away. Extra sea- 
soning may be added in the shape of a little mixed- 
pickle spice tied in a cloth or put in an aluminum tea- 
ball, so it may be easily removed, or bay leaf, some celery 
salt, and so on as may seem advisable. This may be 
added to the heated stock. 

If beef extract or bouillon cubes are to be used, the 



244 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

vegetables should be added to as much water as there is 
to be soup. When cooked, the extract or cubes should 
be added. By using the water in which the vege- 
tables are boiled all the minerals are saved. The neces- 
sary amount of beef extract varies according to the 
brand. The correct proportion of bouillon cubes is one 
to each cupful of water. By this method soups of many 
different flavors may be made from one kind of stock, 
or from prepared meat extracts or bouillon cubes. 

At the same time, many left-overs may be utilized. 
Soups of this nature should be served mainly as a fillip to 
the appetite and an aid to the digestion, for they have 
little actual food value. They do, however, gently stimu- 
late the digestive juices. 

Directions for Starting the Stock-Pot 

The term " stock-pot," unfortunately, is little under- 
stood in America, but it really means that the soup kettle 
becomes the clearing house for all available savory scraps 
which may accumulate in any household. These include 
not only bones, meat scraps, bits of vegetables, left-over 
cereals, rice, celery-tips, turnip tops, stray lettuce leaves 
and the like, but also the parings from various well- 
scrubbed vegetables, as onions, carrots, potatoes and the 
like, an occasional lemon rind, etc. On first thought it 
may seem that the stock-pot is a rather unsavory adjunct 
and many a housewife may sniff in disgust at the thought 
of vegetable parings in her soup. However, the skins of 
vegetables contain a large part of the mineral matter 
needed to assist in many bodily functions. When this is 
discarded in the paring, just so much nutrition is lost, 
but when parings from well-scrubbed vegetables are put 
in the stock-pot, another step toward better health is 
taken. 

The ideal stock-pot is light in weight, preferably of 
aluminum, and should have a tight-fitting cover, for 
every whiff of odor that escapes means loss of nutrition 
and savor. To begin stock-making purchase a soup bone 
and a pound of beef. Crack the bone, cut the meat in 
cubes and brown it, and add two quarts and a half of 
cold water. Bring slowly to boiling point, and then 
add a chopped carrot, skin and all, two onions, chopped, 



SOUPS 245 

and the peeling, two bay leaves, a few celery tops and a 
teaspoonful of mixed pickle spice. Add to this, when 
half done, salt and pepper to taste. Simmer four hours, 
then strain; cool uncovered, then cover and remove the 
fat the following day, when it may be clarified. The 
stock is then ready for use in making sauces, gravies, 
meat-flavored dishes, etc., and is an excellent foundation 
for any kind of soup. Bits of left-over vegetables, or 
rice, macaroni, celery, onion salt, etc., may be used to 
vary it from day to day. 

The stock-pot should not be kept constantly simmering 
on top of the stove, as is popularly supposed, but should 
be thoroughly scalded and aired every day. The next 
morning, any remaining stock, together with the ac- 
cumulation of the previous day's foods, should be put in 
the stock-pot, together with enough cold water to make 
the amount about two quarts, and additional vegetables, 
or peelings from scrubbed vegetables, and seasonings as 
may seem necessary. Water from boiled vegetables, or 
from boiled rice, potatoes or macaroni may be added. 
This should be simmered for at least two hours, then 
strained, cooled, and the fat removed. It may also be 
cleared if desired. 

To Clear Soup Stock 

To clear soup stock, add to each quart of stock the 
crushed shells of three eggs ; mix thoroughly and heat to 
boiling point, stirring all the time. As the liquid becomes 
heated the egg coagulates and collects the fine particles 
floating in the stock. Let it boil vigorously for five 
minutes, add a little cold water, as for coffee, let it cool 
slightly, skim and strain through a cheesecloth spread 
over a colander. 

To this soup stock various vegetables may be added, 
such as carrots, turnips cut in narrow strips, whole string 
beans, canned peas, chopped cabbage, small sections of 
cauliflower, etc., or it may contain rice, barley or tapioca, 
any one of which may be cooked in the liquor, thickening 
it slightly. However, when many vegetables or much 
cereal is added, the soup ceases to be merely an accessory, 
and becomes a food, although at the same time it does not 
'lose its stimulating qualities.

CHAPTER X 
FISH 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

There are a few staple ways of cooking fish change 
being made by the different seasonings and sauces that 
are served with them. Breakfast fish should always be 
cooked simply, as broiled or panned, and be served with 
a garnish of bacon, a few oysters, cress or lemon. For 
luncheon, fish is usually prepared in any of these ways, 
and is embellished with some sauce, or is cooked en 
casserole, in ramekins, fried or boiled, while small fish 
are sometimes baked. Any one of these methods is 
suitable for the fish course at a dinner, but if fish is to 
constitute the main course, a large one should be chosen 
and usually baked, served en casserole, planked or boiled, 
while the sauce should be simple. Chowder is used for 
the home luncheon, supper or dinner. 

CLEANING AND DRESSING FISH 

If the fish must be scaled, first dip it in boiling water, 
and then begin at the tail and scrape with a blunt knife. 
Clean, and draw as soon as the fish is taken from the 
water. After removing the entrails be very sure that no 
particles remain close to the backbone. Wash the fish 
quickly all over, drain it, and let it stand upon the ice, if 
possible until time to cook it. However, as the fish 
odor is liable to permeate the ice-box, wrap the fish closely 
in oiled paper, and lay it on the ice. If fish is frozen, it 
must first be thawed out in cold water, then cooked at 
once. 

Boning fish is a simple process that need not take long, 
if one works rapidly and with concentration. At the 
same time boned fish is certainly much safer to eat, and 
far more enjoyable, than fish with the bones left in it. 

269 



270 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

To remove the bones, begin at the tail end, slip the 
knife, which should be thin and sharp, between the flesh 
and the bones working up the backbone. Do this on both 
sides. If the fish is small, like flounder or sole, each 
side forms one fillet; if large, like shad or bluefish, the 
fish is not separated, but is stuffed or broiled or cooked 
as may be desired. Fillets of halibut are made from hali- 
but steak, which are cut crosswise of the fish, and which 
separate naturally into four sections. Haddock and cod 
are also sliced and separated in the same manner. 

The fat of red-blooded fish is distributed evenly 
throughout the flesh, making them moist and rich ; to this 
end they are best not fried, but should be cooked by some 
other method which will not introduce excess fat. 
White-blooded fish are dry in texture because the fat is 
collected in certain portions, so they should be cooked by 
methods which introduce fat, as baking in milk or brais- 
ing ; if frying is to be done, these fish are well adapted to 
it. Olive oil is the best frying fat, clean beef drippings 
being the next choice. Lard is very unsatisfactory unless 
deep fat frying is to be done. 

FRYING FISH IN DEEP FAT 

The most satisfactory way to fry small fish, or fillets of 
fish, is in deep fat. To prepare the small fish, clean them, 
remove the fins and sever the backbone to keep them from 
curling up. Rub with flour, dip in slightly-beaten egg, 
diluted with a fourth cupful of water to each egg, and roll 
in fine dry bread crumbs. Place in a frying basket so that 
they do not touch and fry in deep fat, hot enough to brown 
a bit of bread in a minute and a half. Drain at once on 
crumpled paper. Fillets of fish should be floured, egged 
and crumbed in the same way. If it is desirable to intro- 
duce the flavor of lemon juice or onion, or a spiced flavor, 
the fish should be sprinkled with the seasonings and 
allowed to stand half an hour before frying. 

SAUTEING FISH 

Whole fish may be sauted, or fried, in a spider, but this 
method is best adapted to fish steaks. In this case the 
fish should be seasoned, dipped in flour, fine cornmeal, 




BAKED OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL 




TOMATOES STUFFED WITH SHRIMPS 



FISH 271 

cracker dust, or fine dry bread crumbs, and fried in 
just enough fat barely to cover the bottom of the pan, first 
on one side then on the other. Bacon, sausage and ham 
fat are well adapted to this purpose, if a savory flavor is 
desired. 

BROILING FISH 

Fish that are not too thick are suitable for broiling. To 
do this, rub a fish broiler with olive oil or butter. Re- 
move the head of the fish, split down the back so that it 
will lay flat, and brush with melted butter or olive oil. 
Place in the broiler and near the heat for a few minutes to 
sear it quickly, then cook more gently, turning occasionally 
from side to side. A fish weighing a pound and a half 
requires about twenty minutes. If too high a heat is 
used, the juices will be drawn off, making it tough and 
dry. After broiling, fish are often spread with a little 
creamed butter, either plain, or into which some flavor 
has been beaten. In case the fish is very thick, like 
pickerel or mackerel, it may be put flesh-side up in the gas 
broiling oven, a dripping pan being set under the fish 
broiler a few thin slices of bacon or salt pork being put 
over the fish to baste it. In this case put the fish some 
distance from the flame. Some of the best fish suited to 
broiling are mackerel, bluefish, large trout of all kinds, 
perch, pompano, whitefish, fresh herring and bass. 

BOILING FISH 

Whereas boiling is an easy way of cooking fish it is 
liable to be unsatisfactory, because so much of the flavor 
is lost in the cooking water, and it is a difficult matter to 
cook the fish thoroughly without causing the slices to 
break. The best method is to have the water moderately 
warm, put in the fish, bring it quickly to boiling point to 
sear the fish, and simmer gently until the flesh separates 
easily from the bones five minutes to the pound for thin 
slices, from eight to ten for thicker. The fish should be 
tied in a well-oiled cheesecloth to preserve the shape, or, 
in case of a long, whole fish, it may be coiled up in a fry- 
ing basket. The best utensil, however, is a rack which 
fits into the fish kettle, for the fish cooks in better shape 
and is easier to remove than from any other utensil. The 



272 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

cooking water should contain a half teaspoonful of lemon 
juice or vinegar, and a half teaspoonful of salt to each 
quart of liquid. Bay leaves, cloves, peppercorns, and the 
like, may be added if desired. The best medium for boil- 
ing fish is in fish broth or court bouillon, as the flavor is 
then not wasted, the liquid finally being used for a bisque 
or clear bouillon. 

After boiling, the fish should be well drained, and, if 
the sauce is not to surround it, may be dressed for service 
on a platter, and garnished plentifully with cress, parsley, 
radishes or lettuce hearts, with slices of lemon either plain 
or spread on one half, with finely-chopped peppers or 
pimentoes, and the other half with minced parsley. 
Potato balls tossed in melted butter, stuffed peppers or 
tomatoes, or sliced cucumbers are often served on the 
same platter. If the fish is white, a tomato sauce is suit- 
able. If a fish of marked flavor is used, like tuna or 
salmon, a plain bread sauce is excellent. A blend of fish 
flavors is delicious, so a sauce of some other fish is often 
used. 

In case the boiled fish are small, like brook trout or 
smelts, any of the flavored butters, Hollandaise, or drawn 
butter sauce may be used. 

The fish best adapted for boiling are cod, haddock, hali- 
but, bass, whitefish, carp, flounder, salmon, pike, pickerel, 
perch and trout of all kinds. 

STEAMING FISH 

It is more satisfactory to steam fish than to boil them. 
This is easily done if they are wrapped securely in but- 
tered manila paper, or a paper cooking bag, or merely 
laid on a well-oiled plate. Allow ten minutes to the 
pound for steaming. 

TO BAKE FISH 

Almost all varieties may be baked, although the method 
of baking depends on the kind. Fish of moderate size 
should be roasted whole, the dressing being rich, rather 
moist and well seasoned. 

For roasting or baking the head and tail may, or may 
not, be left on, but the fins must be removed, and the 



FISH 273 

eyes, if the head is retained. Stuff rather sparingly, lest 
the dressing swell and break open the fish, and gash the 
skin along the back so that it will not crack in cooking. 
Strips of salt pork or bacon are laid along the back, and 
frequent basting with hot water, to which a little butter, 
or other fat has been added, will prevent dryness. Allow 
fifteen minutes to the pound. 

If one does not own a rack that fits the fish-pan, strips 
of cotton cloth, about six inches wide, laid lengthwise of 
the pan, with the fish upon it will aid in transporting it to 
the platter. Among the fish that may be baked whole are 
mackerel, bluefish, small salmon, trout, pickerel, bass, 
whitefish, haddock and perch. The sauce should be sim- 
ple, like drawn butter, caper, or ordinary egg sauce. 

Fish, like halibut, tuna, large salmon and cod, are cut 
in steaks or fillets for baking. They may be placed in a 
pan with a strip of bacon or salt pork on each, or, in lieu 
of this, a teaspoonful of sausage, ham or bacon fat. A 
few drops of lemon juice should be sprinkled over and a 
little salt and pepper. Set in a hot oven two or three 
minutes, then add a little hot water, and bakeitill tender 
about twenty-five minutes basting once or twice. 
Serve sprinkled with minced parsley and accompanied by 
a cold slaw, sauce tartare, or any of the sauces designated 
for boiled fish. 

Halibut with Oysters 

Broil halibut steak and sprinkle lightly with lemon 
juice. Heat oysters in butter until they curl. Season

To Open Lobsters 

Separate the tail from the body, and twist off the large 
and small claws. Then cut the thin shell on the inside 
of the tail, and remove the meat. Split this lengthwise 
through the center and take out the intestinal vein, which 
is sometimes red, sometimes white or even black. Then 
draw out the body of the lobster from the main part, dis- 
carding the lungs, stomach and liver. Save the coral, 
pull off the wooly gills, then pick out the meat that lies 
between the body bones. 

If the lobster is small, cut the claws with the scissors 
and remove the meat ; if large and tough it will be neces- 
sary to break them. The small claws and tips of the 
large claws may be reserved for garnishing. 

To Boil Lobsters 

Have the water boiling rapidly, and allow a handful 
of salt to a gallon of water. Enough water should be 
allowed to cover the lobster. Drop in the lobster and

ten minutes on the flesh side, then turn and broil half the 
time on the shell side. Break open the large claws and 
pour over melted butter before serving. 

If necessary to dress the lobster at home, use a heavy, 
pointed knife and make a sharp, deep cut throughout the 
whole length of the lobster, beginning at the mouth. 
Spread open and remove the stomach and the intestinal 
vein.

Make a thin layer of the spinach in the bottom of a 
shallow, well-oiled baking dish or low casserole. Place 
the sole on this, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and pour 
the milk around it. Then cover with the cheese, dot

with butter, dredge sparingly with salt and pepper and 
set in a hot oven for twenty-five minutes. The cheese 
will melt, forming a most delicious sauce. 

Planked Shad a la Easter 

Heat a plank of the desired size and rub thoroughly 
with olive oil, then lay the fish, cleaned and split down 
the back, on it. Brush over with oil and dredge with 
salt and pepper. Bake about twenty-five minutes in a 
hot oven, basting frequently with melted butter. This 
can be done under the gas flame if desired, taking care 
not to burn the plank. 

Decorate with hot, moulded brown or uncoated rice, 
bundles of cooked asparagus, slipped through rings of 
green pepper, turnip cups of cooked turnips, hollowed 
out and filled with peas, radish roses and slices of lemon 
decorated with halved, stuffed olives. 

Planked Mackerel 

Split the fish down the back and remove the bones. 
Heat a plank of the desired size in the oven, rub thor- 
oughly with olive oil and then lay the fish on it, flesh- 
side up. Dredge the fish with salt and pepper, sprinkle 
with a little lemon juice, and bake till tender, about 
twenty-five minutes in a hot oven, basting frequently 
with melted butter. Have prepared a generous quantity 
of Duchess potatoes (about I quart) and pipe through a 
pastry bag and tube around the fish. Brush over with 
slightly-beaten egg yolk and return to the oven to brown. 
Decorate further with stuffed green peppers, or tomatoes, 
with radish roses, and with broiled bacon strips alternating 
with lemon slices on the fish. 

Almost any fine-grained fish may be planked. 

Trout Baked in Milk 

Dress the fish as usual, removing the head, fins and 
tail. Place on a buttered baking platter, dredge with 
flour, allowing one tablespoon ful to each fish, and 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Dot with bits of butter 
and smother the fish with unheated thin cream. Place in 
the oven and bake until tender about twenty minutes. 
The fish will absorb much of the cream. The remainder 



288 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

will be thickened by the flour and can be served with the 
fish as a sauce. 

Trout a la Game Club 

Prepare the trout as usual, but do not remove the 
heads or tails. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, wrap in 
cheesecloth and plunge into boiling fish broth and sim- 
mer until tender, from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, ac- 
cording to the size of the fish. Serve whole on heated 
plates with lemon butter and a garnish of watercress. 
By this process the beautiful fish markings are preserved.

and the small piece at the lower part of the shell, which 
is called " the apron." Then pick the meat from the 
bones and use as desired. 

Devilled Crabs 

To each cupful of crab meat allow two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls soft bread crumbs, 
one or two egg yolks, a teaspoonful of minced parsley, 
a half teaspoonful of lemon juice, and salt and pepper 
to taste. If it seems dry, moisten with a little milk or 
white stock. In the meantime wash the shells, trim into 
shape and heap with the mixture. Sprinkle with dry 
bread crumbs, mixed with a little melted butter, and 
brown in a moderate oven.

SALT AND SMOKED FI^H 

Salt and smoked fish deserve a more prominent place 
in every household menu. In the first place they are 
digestible foods; second, they are cheaper than ordinary 
fish because they contain more nutriment in proportion 
to the weight and have no waste. At the same time the 
various varieties may be kept on hand and are always 
ready for use when needed. 

It is a mistake to freshen dried fish too long, salt 
mackerel and codfish, only if very salt, necessitating 
soaking over night. Herring and salmon, as well as 
bloaters, simply need scalding. Finnan haddie should be 
allowed to soak for an hour in cold water before using.

CHAPTER XI 
THE FRYING OF FOOD 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

FATS SUITABLE FOR FRYING 

Several fats may be used for frying, the ideal being a 
vegetable oil; olive oil gives the best results, but as this 
is too expensive for the average purse, any of the pre- 
pared cooking oils are next best, while lard and beef fat, 
and odds and ends of household scraps, follow in the 
order given. Butter or oleomargarine should never be 
used for frying, as either burns at too low a temperature. 
A mixture of two-thirds lard and one-third home-ren- 
dered beef fat gives excellent results, and is used by 
chefs the world over, because it produces a rich brown 
color unequalled by any other fat. 

Rendering or Trying Out Beef Fat 
To try out beef fat for frying, cut it in small pieces 
and let it stand over night in cold salted water. Then 
drain, add a cupful of cold water to each two pounds of 
fat, and cook gently on the back of the range or in the 
oven, until the fat is clear, all bubbling has ceased, and 
the " scrapple/' or " crackling," is crisp and brown. It 
may then be strained through a cloth into a clean pail or 
can, allowed to stiffen, and be kept indefinitely in a cool 
place. 

Clarifying and Preparing Left-Over Fats 
Mutton fat may also be used in the frying kettle, pro- 
vided that it is soaked for twenty-four hours in cold 
salted water, the latter being changed every few hours to 
wash out the " wooly taste." 

To prepare fat from corned beef, the soup kettle, etc. 
for frying, let it rise to the top of the liquid and solidify. 
Then remove it to the fat pan, add a little baking soda 

300 



THE FRYING OF FOOD 301 

and cold water barely to cover, and let it cook slowly 
until the water has evaporated; or the water may be 
omitted, the soda and slices of raw potato being added 
to the fat instead. When the potato has become brown 
the fat will be clarified. Most of the odors and flavors 
of the meats and vegetables pass off in the steam from 
the water or from the water of the potato. 

Using Savory Fats 

Ham, chicken, bacon and sausage fat should not be 
put into the frying kettle, but be reserved for sauteing or 
frying in a skillet. 

To Try Out Chicken Fat 

Remove all particles of flesh and bits of blood from 
the chicken fat. Let the fat stand for an hour in cold, 
salted water. Then drain from the water, put in an 
open pan, and try out slowly in the oven, pouring off the 
melted fat as fast as it accumulates. t Goose fat may be 
treated in the same way. 

Utensils for Deep-Fat Frying 

Several utensils are needed for deep-fat frying. A 
frying basket and a substantial deep iron or steel 
kettle, with a wide bottom to allow a generous heat- 
ing expanse, so that it is not necessary to set 
the kettle directly over the fire, are the essentials. 
The kettle should be heavy enough so that it can- 
not be easily tipped, and deep enough so that all pos- 
sibility of " boiling-over " fat will be avoided. The 
utensil should be kept for one purpose, as, despite the 
most scrupulous care, it will become permeated with fat, 
thus imparting a disagreeable flavor to any food boiled 
in it. 

When to Fry in Deep Fat 

Deep- fat frying is used ^for various foods ; croquettes, 
fish-balls, thin meats, like veal steak or chops or chicken, 
small fish, as oysters, smelts or brook trout, fritters, 
doughnuts, fried cakes, and several vegetables as well 
can be cooked in it with much less trouble and better re- 
sults than in the skillet. It is necessary to know the 
exact time each must cook before attempting this method. 



302 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Croquettes, which are always made of cooked ingre- 
dients, as chicken, potato, salmon, etc., simply need to be 
browned, and re-heated in the hot fat. When it is of 
the right temperature, they can almost be immersed and 
then be immediately lifted out when they will be 
brown, crusty and hot. Uncooked mixtures, like dough- 
nuts, fritters, and fried cakes, must be cooked more 
slowly, as, otherwise, the very hot fat will cause a crust 
to form before they have risen properly, and the ex- 
panding gases will burst through the crust, causing the 
food to " soak fat." Potatoes for French frying need a 
still longer time, while raw meats cannot cook under five 
to seven minutes. 

The old-fashioned " smoke test " to ascertain the readi- 
ness of fat for cookery is not satisfactory, as any fat that 
smokes is burned, and, therefore, broken up. It is be- 
cause of this fact that fried food disagrees with so many. 
The term " when the fat boils " is still in common usage ; 
but fat itself cannot boil; it is the water within it that 
becomes hot, generates steam, and causes the fat appar- 
ently to " boil." That is why, when wet potatoes are 
submerged in it, the fat rises as in boiling, and, unless 
the kettle is sufficiently deep, effervesces over the sides 
to the heat and may cause a fire. The only easy kitchen 
test for the temperature of fat is with a bit of bread. 
The length of time which is consumed in browning the 
bread determines the readiness of the fat for each par- 
ticular food. The time must be measured by the clock 
to insure success in using this method. The following 
table gives the exact time needed to brown the bread in 
testing for each food :

How to Prevent the u Soaking of Fat " 

In order to prevent " soaking fat ' all foods cooked in 
deep fat should contain, or else be coated with, some al- 
buminous substance, such as egg or milk. As heat has 



THE FRYING OF FOOD 303 

the power of hardening albumen at once (as in the fry- 
ing of eggs) a coating is immediately formed through 
which the fat cannot penetrate, if it is of the right tem- 
perature. 

Egging and Crumbing Croquettes 
In making croquettes it is customary to prepare the 
mixture, form it into any shape desired, roll it in crumbs 
or flour, then in egg whites and water (J cupful of water 
mixed with an egg white will cover six croquettes) and 
again in crumbs or flour. (A half tablespoonful of 
gelatine, softened and dissolved in a half cupful of boil- 
ing water, may be substituted for the egg.) With egg, 
dry, sifted bread crumbs are used, while flour or meal is 
combined with milk as either will absorb the excess 
liquid. Either combination forms a delicious thin crust, 
through which the juices of meat, for instance, cannot 
escape, any more than the fat can enter. Care must be 
taken absolutely to cover every part of the croquette 
with the coatings, or the fat will enter at the exposed 
part and cause the croquette to burst. 

How to Fry Foods in Deep Fat 

One or two eggs are always added to the batter for 
doughnuts or fritters ; this acts just as the egg with which 
the croquette is coated, and keeps out fat. If the dough 
is too short, however, fat will be absorbed. Drop the 
batter by tablespoonfuls into the hot fat. Meats or 
small fish should be " coated " according to the direc- 
tions given for croquettes. French fried potatoes, fish, 
meat and croquettes should be placed in the frying 
basket before being lowered into the fat, as by this means 
several articles can be cooked at once, and be quickly re- 
moved when done. Doughnuts and fritters should be 
slipped directly into the fat without aid of the basket, and, 
as they should rise immediately to the surface, they can 
be readily removed with a long-handled fork. It is 
never necessary to " turn " a fritter or doughnut, as 
when they are " done " on one side, the heavier weight 
of the uncooked dough on the top will cause them to turn 
over without assistance. In frying, no article should 
touch another, as steam will be created at the point of 



304 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

contact, which will cause the crust to burst. No matter 
what the food, it should always be drained on crumpled 
brown paper or paper toweling before serving. 

With the right care, fat will last as long as a drop 
remains. When nearly cold, it should be put through 
a fine strainer or cloth into a clean can ; after being used 
several times, it will not color the foods well and, when 
cooked, they will have a slightly unpleasant taste. It 
must then be clarified. This is done just as the left-over 
fat is prepared for the frying kettle by heating with 
the sliced raw potato and soda. 

It may seem on first thought that deep-fat frying is 
more troublesome than in the ordinary skillet. When it 
is considered how quickly the foods cook, and how much 
easier it is to prepare them in this way, instead of stand- 
ing over the hot stove to watch the skillet, and when the 
saving in fat is recalled, any housewife will adopt this 
method if she must fry at all 

Various fires have resulted from careless handling of 
the deep-fat kettle, but just as many fires can occur from 
the fat-laden spider ; and any careful housewife, whether 
she fries, or broils or cooks in any way, will have at 
least a pail of sand in her kitchen to meet such an emer- 
gency. This will quench any fire from burning fat 
or oil, or blazing paper, and this little timely precaution 
in the kitchen may be the means of avoiding serious acci- 
dent and saving hundreds of dollars' worth of property. 

CROQUETTES 
Shaping Croquettes 

Croquettes should bevnade rather small, as they will 
then heat through while the outside is browning. A 
good standard measurement is a rounded tablespoonful 
of the mixture to a croquette. In shaping, first make 
them into balls, having the mixture as soft as it can pos- 
sibly be handled and cuddling, rather than pressing, it 
into s*hape. Roll these balls lightly in flour or fine 
crumbs. When all have been formed into balls, start at 
the beginning again and give them any shape desired, 
either cylindrical, in the form of cutlets, or pyramids. 



THE FRYING OF FOOD 305 

Then egg and crumb. If they are allowed to stand a few 
minutes after < the first shaping, they can be easily 
handled.

CHAPTER XII 

MEATS 
HOW TO BUY MEATS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

As meat plays such an important role in the menus of 
most households, every housewife should have a thorough 
understanding of how to buy meats, not only that she may 
thus be able to spend economically but also that she may 
serve the most wholesome foods. The complaint is often 
made that meat is too high, but the butcher is seldom 
charging more than a reasonable price. His cost of doing 
business has increased rapidly during recent years he 
has to pay higher wages as well as deliver his packages, 
which were formerly carried home by the purchasers. 
All these " extras " count and if we demand this service we 
must be prepared to share our part of the cost. 

There are three grades of meat good, second best and 
poor. The first is sold mostly to hotels and clubs, as it is 
very heavy and expensive. The second is carried in first 
class markets and is of the same quality as the first but 
from lighter cattle. The third is sold only in the cheap 
markets. The cheapest grades do not contain so much 
nourishment as the better beef, for low-priced cattle are 
usually fed on brewers' grains, cotton-seed meal and the 
like, which fatten the cattle but produce soft, flabby flesh, 
which shrinks to a greater extent in cooking than the bet- 
ter grades. Besides, there is as much bone in a poor ani- 
mal as in a fat one, so that in buying cheap grades one 
pays for a larger percentage of bone. Good beef has firm 
fat, tinged with pink, and the meat is interwoven with 
threads of fat. Poor beef has a very yellow fat and the 
meat is lean and scraggy, and even the porterhouse is 
tough. 

316 



MEATS 317 

Meat is cut in different ways in different sections of the 
country, but the underlying principles are the same. A 
side of beef is always divided into a forequarter and 
hindquarter, the latter containing the loin, from which 
the highest priced steaks and roasts are cut. It is an 
easy rule to remember that meat is most expensive in the 
center of the animal and cheaper at the extremities, for the 
latter are toughened through muscular action. Most peo- 
ple- do not like the cheap cuts because they are unable to 
make them tender through cooking, and they therefore 
buy steaks and roasts. This excess demand makes steaks 
and roasts unduly high in price in comparison with the 
food value which they furnish. Most people overlook the 
fact that most of the inexpensive cuts have little waste, 
so that besides costing less per pound the meat goes twice 
as far. The waste from a two-pound sirloin steak, for 
instance, averages about three-quarters of a pound. In 
France, all cuts of beef are frequently sold at one price, 
because it is almost impossible to dispose of the so-called 
better cuts on account of their greater amount of waste. 

Too many housewives buy in unnecessarily small quan- 
tities veal cutlet to-day, a small roast of beef to-mor- 
row, chops after that, and so on something different for 
every day. If one can afford to do so, this practice may 
be followed, but if one's means are limited, it is far better 
to buy in quantities sufficient for three days at a time. 
It is not necessary always to prepare the meat the same 
way, for the butcher will gladly cut it for different uses. 

Take a chuck rib weighing fourteen and a half pounds 
as an illustration. Properly cut this piece of beef would 
provide two and a half pounds of soup meat, three 
pounds of beef for a pot-roast, a five-pound roast from 
the eye-piece, and four pounds of bone and fat. The 
bone is useful for soup stock and the fat can be rendered 
for cooking. At average prices the housewife would save 
about thirty-five cents by buying the entire chuck rib. 

Most of the corned beef comes from the plate part 
of the hind quarter. There is more waste to the cheaper 
cuts of corned beef than to those of higher price, because 
they contain more bone and a larger proportion of fat. 
Five pounds of corned beef from the navel, when boned, 
will only produce two and three-quarter pounds of clear 



318 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

meat, so that the actual cost is more than if the best cut 
had been bought in the first place. 

It often pays to corn beef at home. In case one buys a 
quantity of meat at a time, as when purchasing a chuck 
rib or the aitch bone sold in the east part of it can be 
put into brine, or, if one wants a cheap cut, fresh meat 
can be bought the butcher will bone it and the 
bones can be used for stock, instead of throwing them 
away, as is done when they have been corned. 

To Corn Beef 

To corn beef, dissolve rock salt in water until it will 
float a raw potato. Plunge in the meat, weight it, cover 
and let stand in a cool place from two to four days, ac- 
cording to the degree of saltness desired. 

The Cheaper Cuts 

Brisket is equally good corned or fresh, although it 
contains considerable bone, a six-pound piece giving three 
pounds of meat to pot-roast, two and a half pounds of 
bone for stock, and a half pound of fat to render for 
cooking. 

A good cook prepares fresh brisket, slicing it when it 
is done, and pouring over the stock in which it is cooked, 
letting the meat drink it up. This is served with a horse- 
radish sauce and plenty of mashed potato, sprinkled with 
fried onions. Potato pancakes may be served instead of 
the mashed potato. 

Another inexpensive cut is flank steak. This can be 
scored and fried and served with a tomato sauce, or it can 
be made into " blind duck." To do this it should be 
stuffed with chopped onions and potatoes, well-seasoned 
with salt, pepper and sage, tied securely and braised. Or 
it can be used for beef roulades, with vegetables, in a 
stew, or boiled and made into a pie. It is clear meat with 
no waste, when well trimmed. 

Flank Fat and Kidneys 

Flank fat can be rendered with practically no waste 
and sells for about the same price as suet. It is not 
economy to buy very cheap fat, for it contains so much 
meat fiber that is waste. In fact it always pays to pur- 



MEATS 319 

chase meats that are well trimmed, at a higher price per 
pound than to buy cheaper grades that contain a great 
deal of waste. 

Kidneys are an inexpensive article and they may appear 
on the table in a variety of forms. 

The Rump and Round 

The rump weighs about twelve pounds and furnishes a 
fine pot-roast or corned beef, with soup stock from the 
bones. 

The round is divided into two parts, the top and bottom, 
which are generally cut up into steaks, those from the top 
being the best. The bottom cuts, however, if cut from 
good beef, are tender. They will " go further " if cooked 
en casserole, or rolled up and braised like a " blind duck " 
and served with plenty of gravy. A thirty-pound round 
cuts up into about twenty pounds of steak, the balance 
going into chopped meat and trimmings. When chopped 
meat is offered for sale at a low price, it almost certainly 
contains a high percentage of fat, and sometimes a great 
deal of water, for it is just as easy to " plump " beef as 
chicken or oysters. It is more economical to pay a little 
more and get honest meat. If he butcher will not let you 
see his meat chopped, it is wise to grind the meat at home. 

The Horseshoe of Beef 

The horseshoe is a small piece of clear meat which 
weighs about two pounds and a half and which makes an 
excellent pot-roast or stew. 

The Leg of Beef 

The leg weighs about nineteen pounds and contains 
about five and a half pounds of meat and fourteen pounds 
of bone. Thus it does not pay to buy the entire piece, as 
it is much cheaper to purchase the clear meat with as 
much bone as is needed. This meat makes an excellent 
shank stew, which, to be perfect, should be accompanied 
by marrow balls. 

A shin cut from the forequarter can also be used in a 
similar way. The forequarter chuck is not cheap as it 
contains so much bone, the amount increasing as it goes 



320 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

into the shoulder blade, but it makes good stew or boiled 
beef. 

Beef Hearts, Tripe and Liver 

Beef hearts are rarely kept in the average market but 
they furnish a good food at low cost. They average 
about three and a half pounds and can be stuffed and 
potted, or braised with vegetables. They also make ex- 
cellent mince meat. 

Tripe usually sells at a low price and it can be used in 
many ways. Beef liver is cheap, too, and, if the outer 
membrane is stripped off and the veins cut out, it can be 
scalded, dipped in flour and fried so that it will be as ten- 
der as calves' liver. 

Variations in Prices 

The season of the year makes considerable difference 
in the price of meats. From May to October the round 
and sirloin cuts are more in demand and, therefore, cost 
more. Because of this rib roasts drop in price, especially 
as few housewives cook roasts in summer, preferring 
steaks. In the fall corned beef jumps in price because 
the purchasers do not know that it can be boiled and 
pressed and served cold in summer with a crisp salad. 
Lamb goes up from March to May, while, if spring lamb 
is late, it is dear until July. Then is the time for the 
woman who has to be economical not to buy lamb, yet 
they are the very ones who do. 

Buying and Cutting Lamb 

As is the case with beef, there are three grades of lamb. 
Good lamb is not very heavy. If the leg joints are stiff, 
the lamb is fresh, and the fat should be firm and white. 
The joints of fresh lamb can be easily separated to show 
the knuckle, while mutton is usually splintered at the 
joint. An eight and a half pound forequarter will fur- 
nish two and a half pounds of stew meat, one and a quar- 
ter pounds of breast, four shoulder chops, which are ex- 
cellent either pan--broiled or en casserole, and two pounds 
from the rack. Besides this there are enough trimmings 
for a barley stew, for instance. If desired, the chuck, or 
shoulder, can be bought separately and boned, rolled and 
dressed for roasting or braising; or the chuck and the 



MEATS 321 

breast can be purchased together, filled with a bread 
dressing and braised, or the shoulder can be raised off for 
a casserole, the four chops under the shoulder cut out, 
and the neck and bones used for a stew. Even a small 
family can dispose of a shoulder of lamb in this way 
and this is economical purchasing if the woman of the 
household is willing to cook. 

The whole hindquarter of lamb weighs about eight 
and a quarter pounds and furnishes eight loin or kidney 
chops, a six-pound roast, and a lamb kidney, besides some 
trimmings. 

The " pluck " includes about a pound and a half of 
liver and a half pound of heart. 

Buying and Cutting Veal 

Veal is divided like lamb and is becoming the most 
expensive of all meats. The shoulder and breast may 
be stuffed with a bread or potato and onion dressing. 
The neck is used for stew and the rump for pot-roasting 
or braising. The leg weighs about eleven pounds and 
contains about eight pounds of solid meat and three of 
bone. The fillet is cut from the leg and then cut up for 
roasting or into cutlets. The balance is used for stew or 
casserole. A large family can dispose of the whole leg of 
veal, but as comparatively few use the knuckle, or end of 
the leg, the butcher is compelled to charge a large price 
for the cutlets in order to make any profit. 

Pork Products 

Good bacon is firm and does not cook away, because it 
is from hogs fattened with corn ; hams should be plump 
and round. Thin hams indicate poorly fed animals. 
Shoulder pork chops should be purchased to a larger ex- 
tent than is the case, as they average four cents less a 
pound than those of the loin and contain more meat. A 
loin of pork for roasting averages two cents a pound less 
than when cut into chops and contains a third bone waste. 
On the other hand a fresh shoulder of ham, if well cut, 
is a cheaper roast and may be boned and stuffed to good 
advantage, while a fresh ham, although it is heavy, con- 
tains very little waste and is delicious. 



322 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Poultry 

In buying chicken or other poultry, the housewife 
should always demand the very best quality, or the so- 
called " fatted " chicken, for in the end it is the cheapest. 
The fatted chicken of three and a half pounds, for in- 
stance, contains as much meat as the cheaper grade of 
four and a half pounds, as in the latter the bones and 
waste more than make up for the extra pound and the 
meat is not nearly so good. 

The same rule applies to turkeys. A housewife should 
never over-buy, that is, secure more than she realty needs. 
This is a mistake which most people make and the result 
is that many cannot afford to have turkey, when if they 
would buy a small turkey of the very best quality, paying 
perhaps a few cents more per pound, the cost would really 
not be top expensive for the average housewife. In most 
cases where a woman needs a five pound chicken the tur- 
key need not be heavier than seven or eight pounds, as it 
contains more meat in proportion than a chicken. 

How to Know Fresh or Young Chickens 
In a young chicken of good quality the eyes will be 
bright and the feet smooth and rather soft, while a fowl, 
or older chicken, will have rough feet and, often, spurs, 
and the eyes will be dull. By opening the bill and smell- 
ing of the mouth, one can determine somewhat the fresh- 
ness of a bird. Also by feeling of the bone on the under 
part of the chicken between the legs. If it is soft and 
pliable the chicken is young and tender. 

Buying on the Basis of Calories 

In the foregoing pages on purchasing the terms 
" cheap " and " inexpensive " have been used to designate 
foods which are low in cost. But the conception of food 
furnished by the calorie changes the meaning of the 
terms. From this viewpoint a food is cheap in accord- 
ance with the number of calories which it furnishes. It 
may be said once- for all that probably few households 
will ever purchase all their foods on the calorie basis, for 
taste and custom will be the leading factors in determin- 
ing the articles which appear on the table. The applica- 
tion of calories to purchasing, however, throws light on 



MEATS 323 

the possibilities of economy and is of the utmost import- 
ance when the household budget is limited, as purchasing 
on this basis will prevent undernutrition although the 
same amount of money is expended as when the foods 
were bought on the basis that the lowest cost foods were 
the cheapest. For instance, tripe is a food often pur- 
chased by the poor because it is cheap, but the figures 
show that at the prevailing prices only from thirty to 
forty calories can be purchased for a cent, while in brisket 
of beef one gets over fifty calories for a cent. Pigs' feet 
at fourteen cents a pound give but twenty-six calories 
for a cent, while turkey at forty cents a pound supplies 
the same number of calories for a cent. Yet the house- 
wife " economizes " by purchasing tongue, which supplies 
but twenty odd calories for a cent and " cannot afford " 
roast lamb which, even from the more costly hindquarter, 
furnishes nearly fifty calories for a cent. 

The following table based on prices current for one 
week, indicate the value of foods on the basis of calories. 
Of course as prices fluctuate the number of calories would 
be increased or diminished, but the proportions would 
remain approximately the same.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING MEATS 

Broiled tender meat is the most digestible of any way in 
which it may be served, if properly prepared. The 
broiler should be slightly oiled with a good vegetable oil 
or butter, and the meat put in and seared at once, then 
turned immediately so that it will be seared on the other 
side and the juices retained. It should be turned from 
time to time during the cookery. When done, the meat 
should present a slightly puffy appearance, due to the 
distention by heat of the encased juices. The salt or 
other seasonings should be added after the meat has been 
broiled. 

Pan-Broiling 

Pan-broiling may be adopted when it is not possible to 
broil over direct heat. In this case a heavy skillet should 
be heated until smoking hot, and the meat should be put in 
without any extra fat, the fat from the edges of the chops 
or steak, or whatever is being cooked, giving out enough 
so that the meat will not stick. Turn the meat at once, 
as in ordinary broiling, and then at a minute or two in- 
tervals until it is done. 

. Oven Roasting 

There is really no such thing now-a-days as the roast- 
ing of meat, unless it is cooked before an open fire, or 
under the gas flame. Meat is usually baked in the oven, 
for true roasting is really just another form of broiling, 



MEATS 325 

should be heated at first to 425 and after the first 
fifteen minutes reduced to 375. By this means the meat 
is seared at once, so that the juices cannot escape, and, 
as in the case of broiled meat, the roast will not look thin 
and scraggy when done, but should appear a bit puffy. 
Salt should be added before the meat is put on to cook, 
and the roast, whatever the kind, should be thoroughly 
sprinkled with flour, some being allowed to fall upon 
the bottom of the pan, so that the gravy will automatically 
thicken itself. Unless a double roaster is used the meat 
should be basted occasionally with a little hot water, in 
which has been melted a teaspoonful of oleomargarine, 
butter or drippings to a cupful of water. If a double 
roaster is used, a little water should be put in the bottom 
of the pan as soon as the flour is browned. 

Roasting Under the Gas Flame 

To roast under the gas flame light the burners five 
minutes before the meat is to be cooked. Put the meat in 
a dripping pan, and dust it with salt, pepper and flour. 
Set the pan on the broiler three notches from the bottom 
of the oven, reducing the gas burners half, and, as soon 
as the meat is seared, turn it over. When brown on all 
sides, baste every ten minutes with a cupful of water in 
which has been dissolved a tablespoonful of butter or 
oleomargarine. The time of cooking depends upon the 
meat. 

Boiling 

So-called " boiled meat " is one of the most digestible 
ways in which meat can be served, yet there is no method 
less understood. The meat should be plunged into a ket- 
tle containing enough boiling water almost to submerge 
it, then be covered closely, set on the back of the range, 
and allowed to simmer until tender. Simmering means to 
keep it just below the boiling point. When half done it 
may be salted. Meat cooked in this way is tender enough 
to be cut with a fork, is sweet and delicious, and will be 
done fully an hour sooner than can be accomplished with 
rapid boiling. Besides all this there is less shrinkage, 
therefore more meat. 



.326 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Stewing 

Stewed meat is prepared differently from boiled meat. 
In this case it is cut into small pieces, " handsome mouth- 
fuls " an old book terms it, put into cold water, covered, 
and brought slowly to boiling point. It is then allowed to 
simmer until nearly done, when the vegetables and sea- 
sonings are added. Lastly the stew is thickened. The 
reason that boiling water is used for the boiled meat is to 
seal or " sear " the meat pores by extreme heat, so that 
the meat juices may be preserved. In stewing, cold water 
is used so that the slow heat will draw out the juices and 
flavor. 

Pot-Roasting 

In this case the meat is seared or browned all over in 
drippings and is then placed in a deep kettle containing a 
few diced vegetables as onions, carrots, etc., with water 
to one-third cover, and allowed to simmer till tender, 
It is most important that it be closely covered, for every 
bit of escaped odor means that just so much savor is lost 
from the meat. If necessary, weight on the cover with 
a flat-iron or brick. 

Braising 

Braising is the intermediary process between pot-roast- 
ing and roasting. To accomplish this the meat is first 
browned in hot beef drippings, then placed on a thick bed 
of vegetables in a kettle containing a small amount of 
water. This is covered, set in the oven, and cooked until 
tender, turning once during the process. 

En Casserole 

Cooking en casserole is a combination of stewing and 
braising. In this case the meat is usually browned, then 
put into the casserole with vegetables, rice, crumbs, or 
macaroni, water or stock covered, and slowly cooked in 
the oven until tender. It should not boil. 

Making Gravy 

Enough flour should be sprinkled on the bottom of the 
roasting pan to thicken the amount of gravy that is de- 
sired. The proportion is a tablespoonful and a quarter 




RICE WITH ONION AND PEPPERS EN CASSEROLE 




CASSEROLE OF LIMA BEANS AND BEEF 



MEATS 327 

of flour to each cupful of stock. This flour should be 
slightly browned before the water is added to the pan, 
and if in the basting the flour is scraped up it' will grad- 
ually mix so that with the removal of the excess fat and 
addition of a very little liquid the gravy will be made. 
However, in making lamb or pork gravy it will be neces- N 
sary to pour- off a great deal of the fat, and considerable 
water will have to be added. If the liquid is evaporated 
to such an extent that there is not enough left for gravy, 
which, by the way, will not occur if a little is added from 
time to time during the cooking scrape up the drip- 
pings in the pan with a spoon. If some more flour is to 
be added, stir it directly into these drippings, working 
quickly, and using a wire whisk. Then gradually pour 
in the water, which should be boiling. If this is done 
properly, there will be no necessity for straining the 
gravy. If desirable to make it of a dark color, add a 
drop or two of " Kitchen Bouquet," salt and pepper to 
taste, or any other seasonings should then be added. 
Good gravy should not be greasy, but smooth and par- 
take of the flavor of the meat. 

Aspic Jelly 

The easiest way to make aspic jelly when there is bouil- 
lon or consomme on hand is to heat a pint of the liquid, 
and add to it a half tablespoonful of vinegar and a table- 
spoonful of granulated gelatine dissolved in a little cold 
water. Pour into a shallow pan and let stiffen. Cut in 
cubes and save as a garnish for cold meats or salads. 

In case there is no good soup stock a quick aspic may 
be made by using the same proportions of canned con- 
somme and vinegar or by boiling a pint of water with a 
half teaspoonful of pickle spice and the vinegar, adding 
two bouillon cubes and the gelatine and finishing as 
directed. 

BEEF 

Roast Beef 

Wipe the meat with a damp cloth ; dust with salt and 
pepper and place on a rack in the dripping pan, or 
directly on the bottom of a double roaster if one is used. 



328 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Dredge the meat with flour, allowing about three table- 
spoonfuls to fall upon the bottom of the pan. Set the 
meat in a hbt oven, and put on the lid, if the double roaster 
is used, and let it stand until seared all over so the juices 
may be retained, and until the flour has become a little 
brown. Then reduce the heat and bake the meat until 
tender. If a dripping pan is used, baste the meat every 
ten minutes with hot water containing a little butter or 
beef drippings, but if a double roaster is used, pour in 
water barely to cover the bottom and it will not be neces- 
sary to baste the meat. To roast beef rare allow from 
eight to ten minutes to the pound; if well done, from 
eighteen to twenty minutes per pound.

casserole, arrange the vegetables around and on top of it, 
sprinkle on the spice, add a cupful and a half of boiling 
water, cover closely and bake for four hours. Serve with 
a sauce made from the liquid remaining in the casserole. 

Plain Boiled Beef 

Plunge the meat into rapidly-boiling, salted water, then 
reduce the heat and let the meat simmer very gently until 
done. This will take about four hours for a five-pound 
piece of round, or -fresh brisket. The meat should be so 
tender that it almost falls to pieces. Drain well, and 
serve with horseradish sauce, a garnish of shredded let- 
tuce and slices of sweet pickles, or sliced hard-cooked 
eggs. Or garnish with hard-cooked eggs and serve with

Put all the ingredients together except the meat. Boil 
up once and then simmer for thirty minutes. Strain over 
the meat. Cover, and let stand for twenty-four hours, 
turning occasionally. Then remove the meat, drain and 
sear all over in beef drippings, together with three slices 
of lemon, half cover with boiling water containing \ tea- 
spoonful salt and the strained marinade, drained from the 
meat, and simmer gently until the meat is tender about 
four hours. Serve with a sauce made of the thickened 
liquid and garnished with slices of lemon, potato or rice 
croquettes and small boiled onions.

on a rack in a kettle, pile the onions on top and add one 
cupful of water, or just enough to keep the meat from 
sticking. A closely-covered heavy kettle should be used. 
Cook until very tender, replenishing the water to keep it 
always the original amount; this will take from four to 
five hours. Serve with gravy made from the liquid left in 
the pan.

meat fine and season to taste. Add the liquor and pack 
into a bread pan, weighting it down. Let stand over night 
to stiffen, and serve in thin slices with potato salad. 

Corned Beef or a " Boiled Dinner " 

Rinse the corned beef in cold water, tie or skewer into 
shape, cover with cold water, and heat slowly to boiling 
point; remove any scum and simmer the meat until ten- 
der, about four hours for a five-pound piece. Remove 
from the water, keep hot and cook the potatoes and tur- 
nips in the liquid. The potatoes should be left whole and 
the turnips should be sliced crosswise. Cook the carrots, 
cabbage, beets, etc., apart in some of the corned beef 
water, allowing one hour for the boiling of the pared car- 
rots, one hour for the cabbage, one hour for new beets 
four hours for old ones. Serve on a very large platter, 
the meat in the center and the vegetables grouped around 
it. Garnish with parsley. 

Boiled Pickled Beef Tongue 

Wipe the tongue, place in a kettle containing cold water 
to half cover, and bring slowly to boiling point. Remove 
the scum and simmer the tongue until tender, about two 
and one-half hours, or when the skin curls back. Half 
cool in the water, then remove the outer skin and bones 
before it is cold. 

Beef Tongue, German Style 

Cook a fresh beef tongue until tender, and remove the 
skin when half cooled. Prepare a sauce as follows : 



MEATS 33i

and turnips and brown with the tongue in the drippings ; 
season with salt and pepper, add a sprig of parsley, the bay 
leaf and thyme and then place in a crock, or casserole, the 
vegetables below and over the meat. Add boiling water 
or stock to touch the bottom of the meat, and simmer very 
gently for two and one-half hours. Partially cool the 
tongue, remove the skin, and serve hot with a vegetable 
gravy made of the residue in the crock ; or on a bed of 
spinach.

spoonful of pickle spice. Then remove the skin from 
the tongue and return it to the water in which it was 
cooked, to cool partly. Trim off the inedible portions, 
remove any globules of fat that may have adhered and 
cut the tongue in thin slices. In the meantime cover 
the gelatine with cold water, and, after letting it stand for

five minutes, add it to the boiling stock, which should be 
cleared and free from fat. Pour a little of this mixture 
into a round mould, or bowl, and, when it is slightly set, 
dispose on this a design of hard-cooked eggs, fastening it 
in place with a few drops of the jelly mixture. Further 
decorate with thin slices of the pickle overlapping. Then 
fill the mould with the tongue, thinly, sliced, "and the egg 
and seasoning arranged in layers ; pour the gelatine mix- 
ture in to fill these spaces and let stand until set. Un- 
mould and serve garnished with cress and hard-cooked 
egg. If desired, the egg and pickle, etc., may be en- 
tirely omitted, in which case it is a quick matter to pre- 
pare the dish.

Remove as much meat as possible from the bone, and 
cut it in small pieces. Crack the bone, taking care to re- 
move all the splinters. Brown both the meat and bone in 
beef drippings, and add the onion cut in rings; fry the 
latter to a delicate brown, and add the water (which 
should be cold), and the vegetables. Bring slowly to 
boiling point, and simmer until the meat is tender abou^ 
three hours. Remove the bones, take off any meat adher- 
ing to them, and remove the fat from the broth. Then 
add the potatoes, which should be parboiled for five 
minutes, season with salt and pepper and cook until 
the potatoes are tender. Thicken, just before they are 
done, with flour dissolved in water a scant half table- 
spoonful to each cup of broth. Serve on a deep platter, 
with buttered spaghetti, noodles or dumplings.

necessary. 

Broiled Steak 

Trim off the superfluous fat. With some of the fat rub 
the broiler ; and then broil the steak over a clear fire, turn- 
ing every ten seconds for the first minute, to sear the sur- 
face so that the juices will not escape. After this turn 
occasionally until well-cooked on both sides. Steak cut 
one inch thick will take from five to six minutes, if liked 
rare, and from eight to ten minutes if well done. Remove 
to a hot platter, spread sparingly with butter, or oleomar- 
garine, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. 

Pan-Broiled Steak 

Wipe the steak with a damp cloth. Heat a frying pan 
smoking hot, place the steak in it, and turn at once, so that 
it will be seared all over. Turn every few seconds until 
done five to six minutes for a steak one inch thick, 
when desired rare; from eight to ten if well done. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spread with bits of butter 
or oleomargarine and set in the oven to become hot. A 
very little hot water may be added to the drippings in the 
pan, allowed to boil, and be poured around the steak. 

Planked Steak 

Wipe, remove extra fat and pan-broil a boned porter- 
house, or short rump steak, cut one and one-half inches 
thick, for seven minutes. Then place on a buttered plank

bag and tube, brush this over with beaten egg, diluted 
with milk, and place in the oven to brown. 

Garnish with sauted mushrooms, stuffed peppers, car- 
rot and beet balls, cauliflower with mousseline sauce, 
string beans and Bermuda onions.

the ends should be covered with strips of salt pork, as, 
otherwise, while roasting they become blackened. 

Dust the meat with salt and a little pepper, set in a hot 
oven for fifteen minutes, then reduce the heat and add a 



MEATS 343 

little hot water, as in the roasting of any meat. Baste 
every ten minutes with the drippings, and bake nine min-

serole or braising dish. Add the bay leaf (tied in bit of 
cheesecloth) and boiling water, and let simmer until ten- 
der about two hours, adding one and one-half teaspoon- 
fuls of salt at the end of an hour. Remove the bay leaf,

milk gravy. 

BACON 

Fried Bacon 

If the bacon is to be sliced at home, be sure that it is 
chilled, and that the knife is sharp. Have the frying pan 
hot. Put in the bacon and turn almost at once. Whether 
or not it is to be cooked crisp depends upon the variety, 



362 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

but in any case it should be drained on crumpled paper 
before serving. Generally speaking crisped bacon is more 
digestible than that which is fat and moist. It should 
be cooked so slowly that the bacon fat does not burn. 

Baked Bacon 

Cut off the bacon rind and lay the bacon on a rack in 
a pan ; bake until crisp about twelve minutes. Drain 
the fat into a jar and keep for cooking purposes. 



POULTRY AND GAME 

How to Clean Poultry 

If the birds have not been cleaned and drawn at the 
butcher's, it will be necessary for the housewife to at- 
tend to these details, which need not be irksome or dis- 
agreeable, if she knows how to do it. 

First of all remove the pin feathers with a pair of broad 
tweezers. Then singe the bird by means of a little 
alcohol which has been poured into a saucer and lighted ; 
or if this is not at hand twist up some newspaper into 
thick strips and use this. The bird should be turned con- 
stantly so that it will be thoroughly singed in every part. 
The head should then be removed, and the crop, attached 
to the gullet and the windpipe, may be drawn out of the 
neck opening. It isnot usually necessary to make a slit 
in the neck. The neck should be cut off about two inches 
so that the skin may be folded back to present a neat 
appearance when the bird is cooked. The neck trim- 
mings should be saved towards making stock. 

The tendons should then be removed from the legs, for 
these harden on cooking and form the flinty, disagreeable 
substance with which we 'are all familiar in the "drum- 
sticks." Make an inch slit lengthwise through the skin 
below the knee joint at one side; on laying open this 
skin, the tendons, which are shiny white cords, will be 
revealed. Slip a skewer or nail under each one and pull 
them out. 

Then make a two-inch opening near the vent, insert 
two fingers, and gently loosen the entrails. When every- 
thing is loose, grasp gently the hardest substance the 



MEATS 363 

gizzard and pull it out. Everything else will come 
with it. Be careful not to press anything too hard and 
then there will be no muss, and no danger of breaking the 
gall bladder. When this has all been done, insert the 
hand and remove the spongy substances which lay under 
the breast in cavities, and the kidneys which will be found 
a little more than half way down the backbone in similar 
cavities. Then let cold water run through the bird until 
it is thoroughly cleaned. If the bird does not seem white 
on the outside, scrub it off with a little soap and water. 
This treatment is usually advocated only for goose, but 
it improves all poultry, unless they are freshly killed. 
If a bird looks wizened, let it stand for a few minutes in 
water to plump up. This treatment is especially good 
for cold-storage birds. 

Dressing Birds for Broiling 

Remove the head and pin feathers, singe, and draw the 
tendons, as described. Then with a sharp, heavy knife 
split the bird down the back, through the backbone; the 
entrails can then be easily removed. If there is ample 
time, scrape away the flesh from the breastbone and lift 
that out, and carefully scrape away the rib bones and 
remove them. This makes the bird much easier to eat 
and more sightly. The legs should also be separated at 
the second joint. 

Preparing Birds for Fricassee 

Clean, draw and remove the tendons, as directed. It 
is not at all difficult to prepare the bird for a fricassee 
if the knives are sharp. Cut off the legs at the first joint, 
using a sharp knife, then separate them at the second 
joint. This is easily done if the legs are bent. Then 
cut off the wings and disjoint them. Separate the breast 
from the back ; divide the back into four pieces, slit down 
the breast cutting it in two. If desired the breast halves 
may be subdivided. This makes 'the white meat go far- 
ther 

Trussing and Stuffing Poultry 

First put a little stuffing in the neck and around at the 
sides where the crop has been. Then fold over the skin 



364 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

to the back and secure it with a small skewer ; then put in 
enough stuffing through the incision made in drawing 
the chicken to fill it three-fourths full. If too much is 
put in, the stuffing will swell and the bird will burst. 
First, however, the oil bag should be removed. To do 
this, cut around it with a sharp knife, and, after removing, 
tuck the tail into the opening, and sew it up with light- 
weight twine and, if possible, a curved surgical needle 
which can be kept for the purpose. Pinion the wings at 
the side of the bird. Then take a long trussing kneedle 
thread it with lightweight string, pass it through the 
wing and directly through the bird and through the other 
wing and then back again, making the two stitches about 
one-half inch long. Tie the string in a bow-knot so that 
it can be easily removed when the bird is done. Fasten 
the legs in the same way. This takes but two or three 
minutes and is infinitely superior to the old-fashioned 
way of wrapping a bird around with yards of string. 

When the bird is not to be stuffed, great care should 
be taken not to make a long incision in cleaning it, the 
ends of the drum sticks being tucked into the incision be- 
fore the bird is trussed. 

The Giblets and Feet 

If a chicken is being used, the feet should be saved. 
Skin them and put them on to cook with the giblets. To 
prepare the giblets, wash the heart and cut it in two, 
lengthwise. Cut off the gall bladder from the liver; 
this is an unmistakable green sack, and great care must be 
taken not to break it, as it contains a very bitter sub- 
stance. Cut through the thick part of the gizzard, empty 
it and pull out the inside tough skin. Rinse the liver; 
put on to cook with the tips of the wings, the feet and 
the trimmings from the neck in a quart of boiling water. 
Use this stock instead of water in making the gravy. 
Serve the giblets, chopped fine, in the gravy, if desired. 
If this is not desirable, chop the giblets, and the next day 
make a gravy for them from the stock and transfer with 
this sauce to ramekins ; break an egg into each ramekin. 
Dot with salt and pepper and shir.

& teaspoonful pepper 

Combine the ingredients in the order given, making 
the stuffing rather moist. 

Steamed Chicken 

Dress the chicken as for roasting, but do not stuff it. 
Truss as directed and brown the chicken all over in 
drippings, melted chicken fat, or bacon fat if the flavor 
is liked. Dust with salt and pepper. Place on a platter 
or in a pan that will fit into a steamer and steam until 
tender about an hour and a quarter for a three or four 
pound chicken. Fowl may be prepared in this way, but 
it will be necessary to steam it for four hours. In this 
case lay two or three small pieces of bacon on the breast 
of the fowl. 

Roast Chicken 

Dress, stuff and truss the chicken as directed. Rub 
lightly with butter or oleomargarine and dust thickly 
with flour, and a little salt and pepper. Place on a rack 
in a dripping pan, or in a double roaster, allowing a little 
of the flour, about 2.\ tablespoonfuls, to fall on the bot- 



MEATS 367 

torn of the pan. Place in a hot oven and let stand until 
the flour in the pan is colored a light brown. Then add 
boiling water barely to cover the bottom of the pan, to- 
gether with some bits of butter, a little melted chicken 
fat, some drippings or some bacon fat, if the flavor is de- 
sired. Baste the chicken with this mixture and replenish 
the liquid if it evaporates too fast. Roast a five-pound 
chicken one and one-half hours, or allow eighteen min- 
utes to the pound. 

Reduce the heat after the flour is browned, as, other- 
wise, the chicken will be dry, instead of juicy and tender. 
The drippings in the pan, with a little hot water, which 
may be added slowly to them, will make a gravy of suf- 
ficient thickness without adding any more flour. Salt 
and pepper, hot milk, hot cream, a little cooked celery, 
or a dozen small oysters may be added to the chicken 
gravy. 

Chicken or Duck Roasted Tinder the Gas Flame 

See general directions for roasting by this method, and 
allow twenty minutes to the pound. 

Broiled Chicken 

Dress the chicken as directed. Then sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, place in well-oiled broiler, flesh side up, 
and broil five minutes. Turn to brown the skin. Place 
in a dripping pan with a little stock, and dot with bits of 
butter. Cover with a second pan and set in a hot oven 
twenty minutes. Serve on a hot dish with a sauce made 
from the drippings, if desired. 

Chicken Stew, with Dumplings 

Remove all the meat that remains on the framework 
of broiled, fricasseed or roast chicken. Add to the bones 
6 cupfuls cold water (for one chicken) or 10 cupfuls for 
two. Turn in any remaining gravy, bits of skin, etc., 
add one-half a small onion, minced, for the first quantity, 
and a few dried celery leaves, and bit of bay leaf. 
Cover closely and bring slowly to boiling point, then sim- 
mer for two hours. Strain, remove the fat and add \ cup- 
ful of brown or uncoated rice, the bits of chicken and a 
cupful of peas if convenient. Boil till the rice is almost 



368 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

tender (about fifteen minutes), season and set dumplings 
on top of the stew to cook. Boil twelve minutes longer, 
and serve at once. 

Old-Fashioned Chicken Pot-Pie 

i (3-pound) fowl i cupful cream 

i cupful fat salt pork, diced Salt and pepper to taste 

3 cupfuls boiling water Short biscuit crust 

4 tablespoon fuls flour 

Clean and disjoint the fowl. Heat a small iron pot 
and put the salt pork in it. Try out the fat, then toss 
in the chicken, and cook until well-browned. Add the 
water, cover and let simmer over the heat or in the oven 
till tender. Season, add the flour and cream, blended, 
let boil up once and set the paste in position in a casserole 
as follows : Cut a strip two inches wide and line the in- 
side of the casserole. Pour in the chicken mixture, set a 
round cover in place over the top of the boiling liquid, 
and pinch the two edges together ; set in the oven, and 
bake till light brown. Invert on a platter, and serve 
surrounded with buttered peas or asparagus tips. 

Potted Chicken 

Select a fowl weighing from four to six pounds. Singe 
and clean, then brown all over in beef or bacon drippings. 
Slightly fry an onion, a cupful of celery tips and diced 
stalks and a half cupful of carrots ; add the chicken, and 
a little boiling water; put in two cloves, six peppercorns, 
a teaspoonful of salt, a bit of bay leaf, and simmer until 
tender about four hours, replenishing the water as 
needed. Serve with a gravy made from the stock, thick- 
ened with cooked brown or uncoated rice. 

Chicken Fricassee 

Dress, clean and cut up a fowl according to the general 
directions. Put the pieces in a kettle with 4 tablespoon- 
fuls of drippings ; let them brown slightly on both sides, 
but take care they do not burn. When slightly browned, 
add enough boiling water to cover, salt and pepper and a 
bouquet of herbs. Simmer until tender, about three hours 
for a fowl, and one and one-half hours for chicken. 
Make a sauce of 2 tablespoonfuls of butter or oleomar- 



MEATS 369 

garine and 4 tablespoonfuls of flour. Add to it slowly 
2 cupfuls of the liquid in which the chicken was cooked. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange toast or 
split biscuits on a hot dish, place the chicken on the bread 
and pour over the sauce. A border of boiled brown or 
uncoated rice may surround the chicken if the toast or 
biscuits are not used. 

Fried Chicken 

Select a young chicken. Disjoint and cut up as for 
fricassee. Roll each piece in flour and brown in a frying 
pan in equal parts of lard and butter, dusting the chicken, 
as it cooks, with salt and pepper. Turn only once. This 
browning process should take about twenty minutes, and, 
after this length of time, the meat should be cooked 
through. Then place the chicken in a pan, or on a plat- 
ter, dot with a little extra butter and steam it for an hour. 
This will make it very tender. 

Make a gravy of the drippings in the frying pan ; add 
additional flour, if judgment so dictates, and use thin 
cream or rich hot milk as the liquid. 

Plain Chicken Casserole 

Dress and disjoint a chicken, according to the general 
directions. Roll in flour, dust with salt and pepper, pack 
in a casserole, and barely cover with boiling water. 
Cook gently until the chicken is tender, about one and 
three-quarter hours. Serve plain with the resulting 
gravy or add a half cupful of sweet or slightly sour 
cream to the gravy, together with a little extra thickening 
to make up for the dilution. Fowl may be used in the 
same way, if four hours are allowed for the cooking.

ham and fowl and cook until the latter is browned. 
Then put in a large casserole with the pepper, stock or 
water, t*he spaghetti and the tomato. Cover closely and 
bake gently till tender, about two hours. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. 

Chicken Maryland 

Disjoint two broilers, or " frys," or a three- or four- 
pound roasting chicken, as for fricassee. Roll in melted 
bacon drippings or butter, season with a little salt and 
pepper, then roll in flour and place skin side up in a 



MEATS 371 

dripping pan. Put a small strip of salt pork or bacon on 
each piece, set in a quick oven and, when the flour begins 
to brown, add a little water to the pan. Baste every ten 
minutes, and, after the chicken is well-browned, cover it. 
A double roaster is excellent for this purpose. Cook 
until the meat is tender, from forty-five minutes to an 
hour, and serve with White Sauce No. 2, made with 
equal parts of milk and cream. 

Chicken Italian

water containing a little celery seed, bit of bay leaf, slice 



372 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

of onion and a little lemon peel. Cool, disjoint and re- 
move the skin. Cook down the broth to one-fourth the 
original amount, when it will have the consistency of a 
sauce. While still warm, dip the chicken pieces in it, 
drain and set away to cool in the refrigerator. The 
chicken will then be covered with a thin shining gelatine, 
which gives a glossy, inviting effect. Serve arranged on 
a bed of watercress. 

Chicken Mousse Loaf 

4 cupfnls chopped, cooked 2 tablespoonfuls granulated 

chicken gelatine, dissolved in 

2 cupfuls boiling chicken 4 tablespoonfuls cold stock 
stock, well seasoned 

Add the gelatine to the boiling stock and stir until dis- 
solved. Add the chicken. Then prepare the second mix- 
ture consisting of 

1 cupful heavy cream 21 tablespoonfuls granulated 

2 cupfuls chicken stock gelatine, dissolved in 

4 tablespoonfuls cold stock 

Add the gelatine to the boiling stock, and, when partly 
set, fold in the cream, whipped stiff. 

In the bottom of an oval mould rubbed lightly with 
olive oil, arrange a poinsettia blossom with petals cut f rOm 
pimentoes and a slice of hard-cooked egg yolk as a cen- 
ter, and parsley as a stem, fastening it in place with 
melted gelatine. When " set " pour in an inch layer of 
the cream mixture, let almost stiffen, and add a layer of 
chicken, continuing until all is used. At serving time 
unmould on a large platter, garnished with lettuce and 
parsley, and surround with cups hollowed from beets, 
rilled with salad dressing. 

Roast Duck 

Dress and clean the duck as in general directions. 
Stuff with apples, pared and cored, to absorb the flavor. 
Truss, place on a rack in a dripping pan with two thin 
slices of salt pork on the breast. Dredge the duck and 
the bottom of the pan with flour. When this is brown, 
add a half cupful of hot water. Baste every fifteen 
minutes until done. It will take from one to one and 
one-quarter hours for a domestic duck, thirty minutes for 



MEATS 373 

a wild duck. Sprinkle with salt and pepper during the 
last fifteen minutes of cooking. Make a brown gravy as 
for other roasts. This stuffing is not to be eaten. If an 
onion flavor is desired, place onions in the bird instead 
of apples. If the stuffing is to be eaten, use a plain prune, 
peanut, malaga or walnut and potato stuffing. 

Smothered Duck 

i 2- or 3-pound duck 3 tablespoonfuls flour 

i small minced onion Stock to half cover duck 

Salt -and pepper i pint green peas

Dress the duck, dredge with salt and pepper, place the 
onion and sage inside the body and partially roast the 
bird. Set in a deep baking-dish or casserole, and half 
cover with hot stock, using about four cupfuls. Thicken 
with butter and flour rubbed together, season, if neces- 
sary, and. add the peas and a trace of mint. Let bake or 
stew till tender, about thirty minutes longer. Season 
with soy sauce. Serve with hominy croquettes and sour 
cabbage.

Dress and disjoint the duck. Dredge with salt and 
pepper, and brown with the onion in the drippings. Add 
the bay leaf, half cover with good soup stock and sim- 
mer until almost tender about two hours. Then add 
the mushrooms cut in bits, and finish cooking. Thicken 
with the flour diluted in a little cold water, and serve 
very hot. 

Roast Goose 

Scrub the goose on the outside with soap and water, 
and rinse thoroughly. Then dress as in general direc- 
tions, rinsing well, and hang up for a few hours to drain. 
Season the inside with a little powdered sage, salt and 
pepper. If desired, it may be stuffed, although this is 
not customary with a young goose. After trussing place 



374 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

on a rack in the pan and cook an hour ; then pour off the 
fat in the pan and dredge the bird with flour, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper and lay slices of salt pork along the 
breast. When the flour is browned, baste the goose 
often with salted hot water, dredging with flour each 
time as well. Cook until the joints separate easily 
from one and one-half to three hours. If the goose is a 
year or more old, it should be steamed until nearly ten- 
der, then floured and browned. 

In making the gravy pour off most of the fat in the 
pan, then make as usual ; the chopped, cooked giblets are 
an addition. If dressing is to be used, the most satisfac- 
tory is of potato and walnuts. 

Roast Turkey 

Dress and truss the turkey according to general direc- 
tions. Use any desired stuffing plain stuffing with 
celery, or one containing chestnuts. When trussed, rub 
the turkey all over with a mixture of equal parts of but- 
ter and flour. Place on a rack in a dripping pan and 
set in a double roaster. Bake according to general direc- 
tions, basting every fifteen minutes. Allow three hours 
for a turkey weighing eight to ten pounds.

Few grains nutmeg A little cream or undiluted 
i teaspoonful pepper evaporated milk to moisten 

Chop the oysters fine, add to the grated crumbs to- 
gether with the other ingredients and mix very thor- 
oughly. This is sufficient to stuff a small turkey and to 
allow for a few small dumpKngs. To prepare these, 
make the mixture into egg-sized balls and poach them in 
the turkey liquor for twenty minutes before the bird is to 
be served. 

Broiled Squabs 

Truss the squabs according to general directions ; dust 
with salt and pepper, and pour over a little melted butter. 
Broil flesh side to the heat until browned, then turn and 
broil the skin side. Finish the cooking in the oven, 
which will take about twenty-five minutes. 

Serve on slices of toast moistened with the residue 
from the pan, and spread lightly with tart currant, or 
barberry, jelly. 

Casserole of Stuffed Pigeons 

Allow a pigeon to each person. Stuff with brown or 
wild rice boiled with a bit of bay leaf and highly seasoned 
with onion juice and celery salt. Truss the pigeons, 
roast them till well-browned in a hot oven, then transfer 
to a casserole ; pour over the drippings from the baking 
pan, half surround with stock, cover and bake gently for 
an ,hour, then remove the birds, thicken the remaining 
stock and season it with tart currant jelly.

water. Bring all to boiling point and let simmer until - 
tender, about one and one-half hours, adding 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of salt at the end of an hour. Thicken with the 
butter and flour rubbed together, add the peas and let 
boil. Turn in the cream, scalded, season to taste, pour 
into a baking dish, and set the crust quickly in place. 
Bake until browned. 

Woodchuck, Clover Style 

After removing the pelt, place the animal on ice for 
twenty-four hours, then dress as rabbit. That is, split 
the body lengthwise (including the head) and carefully 
remove all the organs, especially the little bunches or 
" kernels " under the forepaws, which will otherwise 
impart a strong flavor to the game. Stand thirty minutes 
in cold, salted water, then drain, wipe dry and sprinkle 
liberally with salt and pepper and a dash of curry. Stuff 
with prune dressing and sew carefully into shape. The 
animal is now ready to <k truss." To accomplish this 
successfully, cut the sinews under both front and hind 
paws, bending the forepaws backward and the hindpaws 
forward, pinning each securely into position by means of 
skewers. Tie a string around the animal's neck, then 
catch it on the first set of skewers, pass around the body 
and fasten securely on the second set. Wrap in cheese- 
cloth, and plunge into spiced boiling water to cover, sim- 
mering it one hour. 

The water should contain : 

i slice of onion I tablespoonful vinegar 

i bay leaf i teaspoonful salt 

A 2-inch stick cinnamon 

. Remove the cheesecloth and place the woodchuck in a 
baking pan, and dredge with J cupful flour, allowing part 
of it to fall upon the pan. Insert a narrow strip of bacon 
along the back. When the flour browns, baste every ten 
minutes, for an hour, with 3 cupfuls of hot water, con- 
taining ^ cupful of- butter, and a few spices. 

Remove the skewers and string ; lay the woodchuck on 
a bed of clover blossoms and leaves (as that is the favorite 
food of the little animal) and garnish with strips of 
bacon and lemon slices, alternately on back, bits of 
pimentoes in the eye sockets and a slice of lemon in the 



MEATS 377 

mouth. Serve with the gravy from the baking pan, fur- 
ther seasoned with J cupful of stuffed olives, sliced, 2 
tablespoonfuls minced cooked onion, and J cupful sliced 
cooked carrots. The flavor is delicious a cross be- 
tween duck and squirrel, yet more delicate than either. 

Planked Guinea Chicken 

1 2-pound guinea chicken I tablespoonful minced pars- 
24 cooked asparagus tips ley 

4 green pepper rings , i tablespoonful minced pim- 

Duchess potatoes ento 

3 lemon slices 

Singe the guinea chicken, remove the pin feathers and 
split the chicken down the back, removing the entrails. 
Wash well and dry. Dust with salt and pepper. Put 
the plank in the oven to become hot, then partly broil the 
guinea chicken; brush the plank over with butter, set the 
chicken on it, skin side up, and finish cooking in a hot 
oven. Altogether, it will take from thirty-five to forty- 
five minutes. Prepare the asparagus tips, putting six in 
each pepper ring. Pipe Duchess potatoes about the 
chicken in ribbons and rosettes, with a pastry bag and 
tube, brush with slightly-beaten egg yolk diluted with a 
little milk and brown quickly in the oven. Set bundles 
of asparagus in place, two on each side, and make 
wreaths of parsley and cranberries cooked in syrup at 
either end. Cover half of each lemon slice with minced 
parsley and the remaining half with pimento, and place 
on the breast of the chicken. 

Squirrel Stew 

2 gray squirrels, cleaned and I cupful minced carrots

Put the squirrels on to simmer in two quarts of boiling 
water, adding water as it evaporates to keep the amount 
constant. When tender remove the meat from the bones, 
crack the bones and return them to the broth to cook an 
hour longer. Dice the meat, dust it in the flour and set 
aside. Saute (fry) the vegetables in butter or oleomar- 
garine until soft and yellowed ; add to the broth with the

CHAPTER XIII 
SAVORY SAUCES 



ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

There are three types of sauces which are essential to 
good cookery, the most common being white sauce, which 
is made thin, medium thick, or thick according to one's 
liking. The second is brown sauce, made with soup 
stock and often, reinforced by vegetable puree, or sifted 
vegetable-pulp and juice. The third type consists of a 
foundation sauce made according to the formula for 
either white or brown sauce, and further thickened and 
enriched by egg yolks. Occasionally it is advisable to 
omit the milk in making a white sauce and substitute 
water, and an extra amount of butter, as in making 
drawn butter sauce. Again, a dish may demand a tart 
sauce when capers or pickled nasturtium seeds may be 
added to the drawn butter sauce, as for fish or boiled 
lamb. Sometimes a dish will be greatly enhanced by the 
addition of a sauce made with chicken- or veal-stock ac- 
cording to the formula of white sauce. 

White Sauce 

White sauce may be made according to three different 
methods, although I use but one and find it quicker, and, ii 
the directions are carefully carried out, it combines the 
advantages of the other two methods. It should never 
be necessary to strain white sauce. If lumpy, careless- 
ness in the making is the cause. It is a great saving ot 
time to make the sauce without lumps, and without heat- 
ing the milk- in a- separate utensil, as the process is not 
only shortened, but the time of washing a strainer and 
a separate saucepan is saved. 

The following are the formulas for the three kinds of 
white sauces, all being made in the same way. 

388 



SAVORY SAUCES 389 

Thin White Sauce No. 1 

For use in creaming vegetables. 

i tablespoonful butter Few grains pepper 

i tablespoonful flour I cupful milk 

1 teaspoonful salt 

Medium Thick White Sauce No. 2 

For use in creaming meats, fish, eggs, in making 
creamed vegetable sauces for meats, and in certain scal- 
loped dishes : 

2. tablespoonfuls butter Few grains pepper 

2 tablespoonfuls flour i cupful milk 
i teaspoonful salt 

Thick White Sauce No. 3 

For use in binding together croquettes, certain scal- 
loped dishes and fish and meat loaves. 

4 tablespoonfuls butter i teaspoonful pepper 

cupful flour I cupful milk 

1 teaspoonful salt 

Barely melt the butter in a smooth saucepan or double 
boiler top. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour 
and seasonings, preferably with a wire whisk. Then re- 
turn to the heat and add the cold liquid a little at a time, 
stirring all the while. Be sure that the sauce thickens 
with each addition of liquid before adding any more; 
otherwise, it is liable to be lumpy. Let come to a boil 
and then set over hot water for ten minutes. If the ar- 
ticle to be creamed is added at this time, the whole will 
become thoroughly hot at the end of the ten minutes. 
Therefore this final cooking is not a waste of time. 

In making thick sauce, ^chicken- or veal-stock, or half 
milk and half oyster liquor, may be substituted, according 
to the intended usage. Cream sauce may be made by 
substituting thin cream for the milk in any of the for- 
mulas. Be careful not to heat the butter too hot or it 
will break up. This is Why it should be removed from 
the fire when the flour is added. However, in order to 
cook the flour thoroughly, it is necessary to let the sauce 
stand over boiling water for the ten minutes as directed. 
Oleomargarine may be substituted for the butter if de- 
sired. In this case, increase the amount of salt a little. 
Or, use half oleomargarine and half butter. 



390 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Brown Sauce 

Brown sauce is used whenever it is advisable to add to 
a dish a combination of seasonings that are not very deli- 
cate. Many authorities assert that in making brown 
sauce the butter or other fat and the flour should be 
heated until very brown, and that the stock should be 
added just as the milk is poured in when making white 
sauce. However, I do not find this method satisfactory 
or advisable, for the fat must always be heated to de- 
composing point, which makes it hard to digest. A much 
better plan is to keep on hand a small quantity of browned 
flour. To prepare this, spread the flour in a shallow pan 
and let it stand in a slow oven until the edges begin to 
turn a reddish-brown tint. Stir this, and continue heat- 
ing until the whole is of a reddish-brown color. This 
not only assists in coloring the sauce, but also gives a rich 
nutty flavor. 

The proportions to be observed in making brown sauce 
are the same as those for making white sauce with this 
exception : in making a thin brown sauce use a tablespoon- 
ful and a half of the browned flour to a tablespoonful of 
fat and a cupful of well-seasoned brown soup stock. 
When the sauce is done, add not more than three drops 
of " Kitchen Bouquet " to a cupful of soup stock to give 
it more color if desired. 

If a vegetable flavor, such as onion or celery, is to be 
added to the sauce, it may be done in two ways. In the 
case of the white sauce, it is preferable to add onion in 
the form of onion juice (not onion extract), or if this is 
not desirable, add half an onion to the sauce when the milk 
is partly in, and remove it just before serving. Celery 
tips may be used in the same way. The second method 
of adding vegetables should preferably be used only in 
making brown sauce, and when the fat used is other than 
butter. The vegetables should then be fried gently in 
the fat until almost tender. Then the other ingredients 
should be added according to the directions given. 

The following suggestions give the proportions of in- 
gredients, and the uses for various modified sauces, 
based upon the general directions for the white and 
brown sauces already described.

CHAPTER XIV 
POTATOES 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

In selecting potatoes, choose those of regular shape, 
medium size and with a smooth skin. A bushel of very 
large or knobby potatoes will not yield as much edible 
material as the same quantity of smaller ones, because 
they do not pack in so closely. Potatoes should be stored 
in a cool, dry place, although they must not be allowed 
to freeze. When sprouts appear, they should be rubbed 
off, as the starch of the potato is'their food the potato 
or " tuber " being a storehouse of starch for the nurture 
of the sprout. 

Whereas the potato is a valuable food and has a most 
important place in the menu, it is not adapted to muscle 
growth, and, consequently, is not fitted to occupy the 
place of importance in the diet. Potatoes are approxi- 
mately made up of one-quarter starch, three-quarters 
water, and cellulose or woody fiber, with a trace of min- 
eral matter that these hold in suspension. They are also 
especially rich in vitamins. In preparing them all of the 
nourishment possible must be preserved. The two best 
methods for accomplishing this are by baking or steam- 
ing. 

However potatoes are to be cooked, two rules must be 
observed first, scrub them well ; second, do not break 
the skin unless necessary to remove bad spots. 

Baked Potatoes 

A potato to be baked to perfection demands a hot oven 
then the result will be mealy. An oven that is too cool 
means a soggy, waxy potato that is indigestible. 

In using a coal oven for this purpose put the potatoes 
on the upper grate near the fire-box where the hot air can 
circulate freely about them, or, better still, purchase a 

397 



398 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

potato rack so that they can be more easily removed. 
Let them remain in the oven about forty-five minutes, or 
until " mellow," when pressed with the fingers. In 
using a gas oven the same rules must be observed, taking 
care that the oven is not too hot. If the skins are liked 
very soft, rub each potato lightly with butter, bacon fat 
or oleomargarine before baking. When done, remove at 
once from the oven for just as long as they stand the 
steam is re-condensing and making them soggy break 
open the top of each potato with a fork to let the steam 
escape, and serve wrapped in a napkin in a vegetable 
dish. 

Baked Potatoes, Rocky Mountain Style 
Bake large potatoes according to the preceding direc- 
tions. Slit lengthwise and crosswise of the potato, as in 
making a Maltese cross ; lay open, dust the pulp with 
salt and plenty of paprika and insert a cube of butter, 
mixing the seasonings with the potato in the shell. 

Baked Stuffed Potatoes 

Select large shapely potatoes, scrub well and bake. 
Cut in halves lengthwise, scoop out the pulp, mash, sea- 
son with salt, butter and cream, and then re-fill the skins. 
Brown in a quick oven. 

Adolph's Stuffed Potatoes with Ham 

Select good-sized potatoes. Bake until mealy, then cut 
a thin slice lengthwise from the top and scoop out the 
pulp ; for the contents of every six potatoes allow J cup- 
ful minced ham, I teaspoonful parsley (minced), 2 table- 
spoonfuls cream, I teaspoonful salt, -J teaspoonful pep- 
per, 2 well-beaten eggs and 2 tablespoonfuls butter. 
Beat till fluffy, refill the skins and brown quickly in the 
oven. 

Steamed Potatoes 

To steam potatoes, scrub well, leave the skins on, set 
in a steamer top over boiling water, or simmering meat, 
cover closely and cook about forty-five minutes for pota- 
toes of medium size. The potato loses none of its nour- 
ishment when cooked in this way.

Boiled Potatoes 

When boiling potatoes it is better to leave the skins on, 
as pared potatoes lose most of the mineral salts, which 
lie near the surface. Old, or poor potatoes, however, 
should be soaked an hour in cold water to freshen, and 
then be pared very thinly. They should be dropped into 
rapidly boiling salted water, partly covered, brought 
quickly to boiling point again and be allowed to bubble 
gently until tender when pierced with a metal skewer or 
steel fork. If they are soft on the outside before the 
centers are done, add a cup of cold water. This will 
drive the heat inside and they will be tender throughout. 
Drain at once, sprinkle lightly with salt, and shake gently 
over heat till mealy. 

New Potatoes with Creamed Eggs 
Steam or boil new potatoes. Prepare two cupfuls of 
white sauce, and add to it four chopped hard-cooked 
eggs ; place the potatoes on a platter, pour the sauce over

CHAPTER XV 
VEGETABLES 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

In the chapter on the Balanced Ration the importance 
of vegetables in the diet has been explained. Every 
family should use them freely, for they are vital for effi- 
cient nutrition and good health. To understand the pos- 
sibilities of vegetables in the menu and diet, it is neces- 
sary mentally to classify them into six groups : 

1. Meat Substitutes 

2. Starchy Vegetables 

3. Bulky Vegetables 

4. Vegetables rich in Salts 

5. Watery Vegetables 

6. Esthetic Vegetables 

The group of legumes belongs under the first heading 
and includes beans, peas and lentils. Whereas the dried 
seeds are a most valuable meat substitute and an all-year 
food, the fresh pods or dried fresh pods are no richer in 
protein than any other vegetable. Under " starchy vege- 
tables " we find the cereals, the two most frequently used 
being corn and rice. Polished rice should never be used, 
as it is coated with talc. Both it and uncoated rice are al- 
most entirely starch, containing only a small amount of 
protein, fat and mineral matter. For this reason it should 
serve as an accompaniment to meats or other proteins or 
as a cereal. Brown rice, on the other hand, contains all of 
the grain, and, like home-ground cornmeal, is a splendid 
food in itself. The potato should be mentioned here as 
a specific example of the starchy vegetable. The sweet 
potato is also included in this group. 

Asparagus, carrots, spinach, salsify, cabbage, romaine, 
beets, swiss chard and dandelion greens and celery are 
all bulky vegetables, particularly suitable to use with a 
menu of concentrated foods like eggs, or cheese, for they 

408 



VEGETABLES 409 

afford the necessary bulk to help on the intestinal action, 
and consequently aid digestion. 

This same list really includes the " vegetables rich in 
salts " and to it may be added radishes, lettuce, cress, 
endives, tomatoes, squash, egg plant and cucumbers, 
which contain more or less mineral salts and a large per- 
centage of water. Because of these two properties this 
group is indispensable, as it affords direct salts to the 
blood and water to bathe the body tissues. Under 
esthetic vegetables may be grouped those which are essen- 
tially used as seasonings, a trace giving a dish the sparkle 
necessary to make it out of the ordinary. Radishes have 
this property, so have parsley and watercress, but it is 
most marked in the green or red pepper. 

COMPOSITION OF VEGETABLES 

A slight knowledge of the composition of vegetables is 
of great help in their preparation. They are made up of 
countless little cells, each containing a semi-fluid material 
holding the sugar, protein, starch and salts in solution. 
The layer next the skin is richest in salts. Knowing this 
the thinking housewife will realize that vegetables must 
be cooked in such a way as to retain the semi-fluid ma- 
terial, and to keep in the salts. So she will always use 
boiling water, which has the property of bursting the 
starch grains immediately, so holding the nutriment in 
the vegetable; preferably she does not pare them at all, 
steaming them instead. As the plant grows older the cell 
walls harden into woody fiber, necessitating longer cook- 
ing, and as soon as the vegetables are taken from the 
ground the water commences to evaporate, and they be- 
come withered or shriveled, as the case may be. 

To overcome this, it is necessary to put them into cold 
water, so that they may re-absorb the moisture, remem- 
bering that this treatment should be used only when 
necessary, as every minute of soaking means a propor- 
tionate loss of salts. 

HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 

It has been said that " The secret of cooking vegetables 
is the judicious production of flavor." If this statement 



410 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

is amended to read " the judicious production and reten- 
tion of flavor," the secret of the whole, wide field of 
vegetable cookery is revealed. Unfortunately American 
housewives know only too little about the preparation of 
vegetables, their food value and utter deliciousness, and, 
whereas the vegetable is easily cooked, it generally ap- 
pears in a state of watery tameness and finds conse- 
quent disfavor. No matter how the vegetable is to be 
served, there are a few fundamental rules which underlie 
the cookery. 

All boiled vegetables should be started in boiling salted 
water. This should be kept boiling rapidly for beans, 
onions, cabbage, turnips, carrots, etc., but should be kept 
at a gentle boil for cauliflower and asparagus both of 
which are broken by too rapid boiling. Peas and as- 
paragus contain a high percentage of sugar, so they 
should be cooked in as little water as possible, the liquor 
being the basis of a sauce to be served with them. 
Salted water (a teaspoonful to each two quarts) is used 
for all tender vegetables except potatoes, which should 
be salted after draining, and shaken gently over the heat 
to steam in the seasoning. Tough vegetables, like old 
beans or peas, are improved by the addition of a little 
baking soda. This makes them soft, but allows much of 
the green coloring matter to cook out into the water, re- 
sulting in a distasteful color. 

All dried vegetables, like peas or lentils, should be 
soaked over night to re-absorb the water lost through 
evaporation, and this liquid should be discarded. Vege- 
tables should always be cleaned before cooking, and, un- 
less old, should never be pared. During the boiling 
process the cover should be tilted to allow a circulation 
of air, which insures' a better color and flavor. All 
strong- juiced vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower and 
onions, should be cooked uncovered. This allows the 
vapors to be dissipated rather than condensed, the odor 
being largely dispelled, and, if a piece of wood charcoal 
is put into the kettle, the flavors will be absorbed and all 
disagreeable odors overcome. Occasionally vegetables 
are so strong in flavor that it is desirable to " blanch " 
them. To do this, start in cold water, bring to the boil- 



VEGETABLES 4" 

ing point, boil ten minutes, drain the water into the stock- 
pot, and proceed as usual with fresh boiling water. 

Although it is customary to boil vegetables, they may 
be prepared in two other ways by steaming or baking. 
To steam vegetables, scrub them well, cut out any soft 
spots, and place in a steamer, or in a colander fitted over 
a kettle and covered, and steam until tender. This takes 
a little longer than it will to boil them, but they will be of 
delicious flavor. This method can be used for onions, 
potatoes, cabbage, corn, cauliflower, carrots, squash, tur- 
nips, beets, etc. or the vegetables which are of firm tex- 
ture. Many of this same group can be baked in the oven. 
In this case set them in shallow pans, containing a little 
water to prevent sticking. If vegetables are to be boiled, 
use the smallest possible amount of water, and, if it is 
not available for a sauce, turn it into the stock-pot. By 
steaming, the loss in nutritive constituents is only one- 
third as much as in boiling, and the proportion is the 
same for baking. 

As for seasonings there is nothing better than a 
judicious amount of salt and pepper, with plenty of -but- 
ter. A particularly good old-fashioned cook, noted for 
her vegetable cookery, said, " I always use just as much 
butter as I can afford, then turn my back and put in a 
little more ! " But when the vegetable is to appear as 
the principal dish of a meal, it must be dressed with a 
more elaborate sauce, or combined with other foods into 
a " hearty dish." 

Whereas the vegetable has a clearly defined place in 
every dietary, it must be remembered that it is not in 
itself an adequate substitute for meat, and must be used 
in combination with meat or meat substitutes, in order to 
preserve the dietary balance. This does not necessarily 
mean that the combination appear directly with' the vege- 
table. It may be used in the salad, or any part of the 
meal that is convenient. 

The following menus illustrate this point :

Egg Salad, with Cream Cheese Dressing

The asparagus is the principal dish, yet it does not con

tain the greatest nutriment ; approximately it gives 
bulk and salts and has the property of filling the stom- 
ach (known as the satisfying of hunger) ; the egg salad, 
cheese, and the entire wheat bread contain the principal 
protein of the meal, the cream cheese and butter much of 
the fat, and the cake furnishes starch and sweet. 
Another menu reads : 

Rice, with Tomato Sauce and Baked Bacon 

Lettuce Salad Entire Wheat Bread and Butter 

Baked Custards Cookies 

Generally speaking in this case the fat is supplied by 
the bacon and butter, the bulk by the lettuce, the starch 
by the bread and rice, and the protein by the bread and 
egg and the custards.

Plain Fried Egg Plant 

Pare the egg plant and cut it in slices one-fourth inch 
thick. Season lightly with salt and pepper, egg and 
crumb, as in making croquettes, and fry to a golden color 
in fat hot enough to brown a bit of bread in one minute.

add the butter and other ingredients, and simmer until 
heated and slightly thickened. Serve very hot. 

Stuffed Egg Plant 

Cook a good-sized egg plant fifteen minutes in boiling, 
salted water to cover. Cut a slice from the top and with 
a spoon remove the pulp, taking care not to work too 
close to the skin. Chop the pulp and add I cupful of 
soft whole wheat bread crumbs. Melt 2 tablespoonfuls 
butter, add ^ tablespoonful onion, chopped fine, and cook 
five minutes; or use bacon or ham fat instead of butter. 



414 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Add to the chopped pulp and bread, season with salt and 
pepper, and, if necessary, moisten with a little stock; 
cook five minutes, cool slightly and add one beaten egg. 
Re-fill the egg plant, cover with buttered bread crumbs 
and bake twenty-five minutes in a hot oven. A half cup- 
ful of minced ham or a little cooked bacon may be added 
if desired. 

Baked Stuffed Onions 

Remove the skins from the onions and parboil the lat- 
ter thirty minutes in boiling salted water to cover. Use 
the liquid for soup. Turn upside down to cool, and re- 
move part of the centers. Fill the cavities with equal 
parts of nuts, chopped fine, stale soft bread crumbs, and 
the onion which has been removed, finely chopped, sea- 
son with salt and pepper and moistened with cream or 
melted butter and a little peanut butter. Place in a but- 
tered, shallow baking pan ; sprinkle with buttered crumbs, 
and bake in a moderate oven until the onions are soft. 
Minced ham, cheese or tongue may be substituted for the 
nuts. In this case omit the peanut butter. 

Baked Onion Tomatoes 

Select large, round tomatoes, and cut in halves cross- 
wise. Dust with sage, salt and pepper, and place a large 
thin slice of onion, cut crosswise, on each. Put a half 
teaspoonful of butter, or savory drippings, on each and 
bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. The pan 
should have a little water in the bottom.

Baked Onions 

Slice Bermuda or Spanish onions about an inch thick ; 
place in a casserole or baking dish and dust thickly with 
flour ; season with salt and pepper and dot with butter or 
bacon or ham drippings. Put a second layer on top, sea- 
son and flour in the same way, and almost cover with 
boiling water. Cover and cook gently, for an hour and a 
half to two hours in a moderate oven. The resulting 
sauce may be thinned with a little rich milk or cream, if 
'desired, or the onions may be baked in a broth or brown 
stock instead of water. 

French Fried Onions

one-quarter of an inch thick. Then cut the slices so 
that the onion will be in strings about three inches long. 
Roll these strings in slightly-beaten egg white, diluted 
with a fourth cupful of cold water to an egg white and 
well-seasoned with salt and pepper, and then toss in fine, 
dry bread crumbs. Plunge them in deep fat hot enough 
to brown a bit of bread in a minute and cook until golden 
brown. Then drain on crumpled paper. 

Young 1 Onions in Cream Sauce

from the bulbs. Boil the onions gently in salted water 
until tender, arrange on buttered toast, and pour over a 
cream sauce. 

Creamed Onions 

Peel the onions. Cook uncovered in boiling water 
until soft. Then drain and serve with white sauce.

VEGETABLES 441 



LEGUMES OR DRIED VEGETABLES 

Dried peas, beans and lentils are classified as legumes. 
They are protein foods, or meat substitutes, and their 
place in the dietary is described in the chapter on the 
balanced ration. 

They are all similar as to content and flavor and in 
nearly all cases may be used interchangeably. They 
should be soaked over night or for an equivalent time 
during the day, thoroughly picked over and washed, and 
then boiled. The addition of a little soda at this stage 
softens the hulls and makes the legumes more digestible. 

All legumes may be boiled in salted water with or with- 
out the addition of herbs, onions, or a little garlic. How- 
ever, fat should usually be added to reinforce the veg- 
etable. This may be in the form of fat ham, fat salt 
pork, or bacon, fat corned beef, olive oil or the drippings 
from bacon, or sausage. After boiling until soft, any 
one may be put in a bean pot, together with molasses or 
brown sugar and pepper, and baked. 

Different sections grow different legumes. Any 
housewife will profit by a visit to a large grocery store 
where she can see displayed and purchase legumes of 
various kinds. The " Navy or soup bean " is commonly 
used, as are lima beans and split peas. But the several 
varieties of kidney beans, the many kinds of cow peas, 
and soy beans are scarcely used at all, yet they furnish 
one of the cheapest sources of protein food that may be 
obtained. 

The legumes need long slow cooking to render them 
digestible. A fireless cooker is excellent for this pur- 
pose. 

Plain Soy Beans 

Soak the beans over night, boil up with a little soda, 
drain, and add water to cover. To a pound of beans use 
a tablespoonful of salt and a half-cupful of savory drip- 
pings. Boil until tender, about eight hours, or cook over 
night in the fireless cooker. If desired, a pint of stewed 
tomatoes, or four quartered fresh tomatoes and a minced 
green pepper may be added to the beans half way of the 
cooking. The drippings may be omitted. 



442 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Soy Beans with Samp

day in a covered utensil. When done, the whole mix- 
ture will be rather mushy. Add water as necessary dur- 
ing the cooking. 

Pried Soy Beans with Samp 

Put the left-over mixture of soy beans with samp

bacon, or ground raw beef. Boil gently for four hours, 
adding water as necessary, then add a half pound of 
brown or uncoated rice and boil an hour longer. 

Roast Pork with Cow Peas 

Prepare roast pork as directed in the chapter on meats. 
In the meantime a half pound of cow peas should have

an hour before it will be done, and cooked until the meat 
is done and the peas are brown.

CHAPTER XVI 
THE EDIBLE WEEDS 

Many of the so-called weeds add variety and taste to 
the diet and as ballast and mineral foods induce a higher 
degree of health. As these weeds are all great pests, it 
is needless to say that the more they are cut the less they 
propagate, so by their use not only is a food procured 
without price, save the labor of gathering, but at the 
same time a step forward in eradicating a pest is made. 

Dock Root 

The leaves of dock root are efficacious in the diet as 
greens and the tonic properties which the plant contains 
are of value in the great art of keeping well. 

Milkweed 

Milkweed is one of the most delicious greens and may 
be used from the last of May on through the season. 
The plant may be recognized as a single stalk with oval- 
pointed leaves. Usually it branches into two or three 
stalks at the top. It can always be identified by the 
white, milky juice found in the stems. Milkweed should 
be eaten either when young (about six inches tall) or 
when the branches come. In the latter case only the 
branches are used, as the stalk grows bitter with age. 
When the young stalks are gathered, they may be bunched 
and boiled as asparagus and served on toast with either 
a butter or cream sauce. In case the branches are used 
it is more satisfactory to prepare them as greens, wash- 
ing thoroughly, then boiling geptly in a small amount 
of salted water for thirty minutes ; then they are drained, 
chopped and seasoned with pepper and butter. Oc- 
casionally the greens may be heated up in cream sauce or 
scalloped with entire wheat bread crumbs, cream sauce 
and a little hard-cooked egg. This is a delicious supper 
dish.

Purslane 

Purslane or " pusley " in old days was commonly 
used as a salad or pot herb, great medicinal virtue being 
ascribed to it. One ancient writer said, " Purslane dotii 
mitigate the great in al the inward partes of the bodie, 
sembably of the head and eyes." While we cannot credit 
it with such specific powers, it is certain that along with 
the great group of greens it possesses purifying qualities 
beneficial to the body. Purslane appears about the mid- 
dle of May, growing most prolifically in gardens, veg- 
etable patches and corn fields. It is a prostrate, or trail- 
ing, plant, one root growing many stems, branching out 
and covering a circular surface. The stems are fleshy 
and red while the leaves are about the size of the thumb- 
nail and almost round. As purslane has little flavor it 
tastes rather flat when cooked as greens, unless accom- 
panied by a piece of ham, bacon or salt pork. As it is 
very succulent it makes a good salad, if it is dressed 
raw with oil, vinegar and a high seasoning of salt and 
pepper. It may be combined with sliced radishes or 
shredded green peppers to good advantage, or strewn 
with minced mint, when roast lamb or cold ham is to be 
served. It is also frequently used as a garnish. 

Narrow Dock 

Narrow dock, " curled dock," or " sour dock," for it is 
known by various names, is a particularly persistent and 
plentiful weed, ready to use from June throughout the 
season. It may be recognized easily. The stem is erect, 
angular and furrowed, growing from eighteen inches to 
two and a. half feet tall and branching from the bottom 
up. The leaves are lanced-shaped and pointed, with the 
margins strongly shirred. The flowers are drooping 
green, inconspicuous clusters growing in circles about the 
stem. The leaves only are used, and are always cooked 
as greens and seasoned with salt and pepper. As the 
name " sour dock " suggests, the flavor is distinctly sour 
and for this reason it should be served with a suitable 
meat, as beef tongue, ham or corned beef, with which the 
flavor will harmonize. Occasionally the chopped cooked 
greens are moulded in cups in individual portions, and 
served on lettuce as a salad, accompanied by boiled dress- 



THE EDIBLE WEEDS 449 

ing to which has been added a generous quantity of 
chopped, cooked ham. In this case it is sufficiently sub- 
stantial to serve as a main dish at luncheon or supper. 



Sorrel 

Sorrel was always cultivated in old-time gardens, but 
it is now seldom found except in the wild state, in stubby 
or stony fields and along fence rows. Sorrel may be 
used as a salad plant, either alone, dressed simply with 
oil and vinegar, or in combination. Potato or egg salad 
or shredded cabbage combined with green peppers are 
delicious with it, while any kind of fish salad is improved 
by the addition of a small quantity. It is also used in 
soups, " cream of sorrel " being a favorite in France. 
To make this soup, cook a cupful of chopped sorrel in 
a tablespoonful of butter, add a little sugar, one-half tea- 
spoonful of vinegar, a teaspoonful of salt and two table- 
spoonfuls of uncoated rice, then a pint of boiling water. 
Let simmer until the rice is soft. Add three cupfuls of 
veal or chicken stock and strain. Beat an egg yolk 
slightly; add a cupful of light cream and turn into the 
soup, stir until it becomes hot, strain and serve. 

A combination of dandelion and sorrel as greens is de- 
licious, the flavors supplementing each other especially 
well. 

Plantain 

Plantain is a familiar dooryard weed which grows in 
nearly all localities. This weed may be used either as a 
salad or a green. If it is to figure in a salad, only the 
young leaves should be used, and, as the plant is rather 
lacking in flavor, a dash of curry powder and Wor- 
cestershire sauce may be added to good advantage with 
French dressing. An excellent combination consists of 
one-half as much shredded plantain as celery, with a dash 
of minced green pepper, put together with a French 
dressing. As a green it may be used either plain, with 
salt pork or ham, or in combination with dandelion and 
horseradish, equal parts being used of the plantain and 
dandelion and one-third of horseradish. Plantain may 
be obtained throughout the season. 



450 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Pigweed 

Pigweed was formerly cultivated in gardens, like spin- 
ach, but it is now found wild in corn fields, vegetable 
patches, barnyards and almost everywhere. The leaves 
should be gathered young and cooked like any green. 

Dandelions 

Whereas dandelions are now generally used, they are 
usually so unattractively prepared that few people really 
like them. When cooked as greens, they should be first 
scalded., then cooked, like other greens, slowly in their 
own juices, then chopped fine and seasoned well with 
salt, pepper and butter. If dandelions are to be served 
as a salad, only the most tender plants should be used. 

The tiny young leaves of dandelion may be used as 
a green with any vegetable salad a simple dressing of 
oil, vinegar, salt and pepper being sufficient. Boiled 
finnan haddie with a lemon sauce is delicious served on a 
bed of dandelion greens, while any left-over greens may 
be moulded and served cold with mayonnaise or boiled 
salad dressing. Dandelions are also delicious in com- 
bination with an equal quantity of spinach. 

Cowslip 

Cowslip, or marsh marigold, is one of the first greens 
to appear and is in season from the last of March through 
April. It is always found in moist places and can be 
identified by its smooth, dark green leaves, about two 
inches in diameter, almost round, save for a deep notch 
where they are joined to the stem, and by its brilliant yel- 
low flowers, in shape much like a buttercup. 

Cowslips 'are always used as greens, and a dash of 
nutmeg should be added with the other seasonings. The 
dish will be greatly improved if it is bestrewn with a 
little hard-cooked egg at serving time. It may be made 
into a soup, like a cream of sorrel, a cupful of cooked 
and sifted cowslip pulp being substituted for the sorrel, 
and a slice of onion and a bit of bay leaf being added 
"for the seasoning. Cooked and moulded the cowslip 
makes a delicious salad, which should be served with 
boiled dressing and small balls of cottage cheese dusted 
with paprika. 



THE EDIBLE WEEDS 451 

Brake Fern 

Those whose hearts are steeled against Nature do not 
hesitate to cut the curly white fronds of the brake fern 
and cook them as greens. The best way to do this is by 
steaming, as then the shape is not spoiled, the fronds 
being attractive in appearance when cooked and suitable 
to serve on toast with a butter or cream sauce. 

Mustard 

Either white or black mustard is a weed that can be 
used to advantage in the diet. It is well known as a 
plant growing along roadsides and in any cultivated 
ground, being particularly troublesome in grain fields and 
pastures. Like all plants mustard is at its best when 
young. The leaves may 'be used in combination with 
other greens which have a bland flavor, like purslane or 
pigweed, as the sharp flavor of the mustard gives them 
zest. When very young and crisp, mustard forms a good 
salad green and may be dressed either plain or in com- 
bination with cabbage, tomatoes, string beans or peas. 
A bacon, fish or cheese sandwich is greatly improved by 
a few mustard leaves dipped in French dressing. It is 
also a good salad accompaniment to cheese dishes or other 
foods difficult of digestion, as the sharp flavor stimulates 
the digestive organs. As mustard is bulky it is an 
excellent laxative. 

Nettles 

The nettle is another edible plant formerly much used, 
but now little known. The tender shoots, plucked be- 
fore the plant begins to flower, may be cooked as greens 
or made into an old-fashioned dish known as " nettle 
porridge " a type of creamed green worth trying. If 
gloves are worn while picking, no ill effects from the 
nettles will be felt. 

Mint 

Mint is a weed of possibilities, although it is now little 
known save in a sauce. A handful of mint tops added to 
green peas when cooking gives a delicious flavor, while 
a touch of it is indispensible to dried pea or bean puree. 
Finely minced, the leaves may be added to orange fruit 
cup and banana salad, while a mint sherbet or quick 
mint jelly is delicious. In combination with cabbage, 



452 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

cucumbers or tomatoes it makes a delectable salad, while 
a sprig added to iced tea or lemonade is refreshing. 

Wintergreen 

Wintergreen is a plant that is slowly coming into 
favor among country folk as a distinct flavoring agent. 
In the spring the tiny reddish leaves or " pippins " are 
a delicious addition to any fruit salad dressed with a 
French fruit dressing. Suitable combinations with win- 
tergreen are bananas, pineapple and orange, or apple, 
nut and celery. It may be added to dressed cabbage, or 
used instead of mint in mint sauce. Wintergreen jelly 
is somewhat of a novelty and may be made by adding 
one cupful of chopped wintergreen leaves to a cupful 
and a half of water which centains a tablespoonful of 
vinegar, two of lemon juice, one-half tablespoonful of 
sugar, a dash of nutmeg, and a scant tablespoonful of 
granulated gelatine dissolved over steam in a little water. 
This should be moulded and served as a garnish to cold 
ham or lamb, sprays of wintergreen being used to gar- 
nish the dish. 

Checkerberries 

Checkerberries may be used instead of pippins in any 
fruit salad, while they are delicious when cooked in sugar 
syrup and candied like orange peel. 



CHAPTER XVII 
SALADS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

Of all the summer foods salads are perhaps the least 
understood. To many the word signifies only green, 
straggling, frequently bitter lettuce, served with a sweet- 
sour apology for something called a dressing. Again, it 
means the beloved of the delicatessen store and the church 
supper the onion-filled, vinegar-soused, mushy mix- 
ture known as potato salad, or it conjures up a palate-pic- 
ture of a varied number of fruits besprinkled with marsh- 
mallows, swathed in mayonnaise, and finished off with 
nuts. Alas, for the mistreated salad ! Correctly made 
it is a healthful, nourishing and appetizing adjunct to 
the daily meals; improperly prepared, it had better be 
omitted from any menu. 

Of course, the palate soon tires of a daily diet of any 
one salad plant, but when there are so many from which 
to make selection, all at about the same price, there is no 
excuse for monotony. Of the many plants comparatively 
little known, watercress, chicory, romaine, endive, corn 
salad and young dandelions offer a wide choice which 
may be supplemented by the more common lettuce, cel- 
ery and cabbage. Then there are the wild salad plants 
as purslane, or " pusley," sorrel, young mustard, mint, 
or plantain described in the chapter on edible weeds. 

How to Prepare and Crisp Salad Greens 

No matter what type of salad is to be made, whether 
the plant itself is to form the base, or whether it is to be 
used merely as a garnish to the other ingredients, the 
salad plant must be crisp and thoroughly clean. Too 
much stress cannot be laid on the necessity of the latter, 
for the salad plant is not cooked, and every bit of dirt 

453 



454 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

must be washed off, as it is a splendid harborage for 
disease germs. 

The leaves should be entirely separated from the roots, 
washed in plenty of cold water, and then rinsed. The 
outside leaves should be separated from those that are 
more desirable, and should be shredded as a salad green, 
or used in soup, for they are too rich in minerals to be 
consigned to the garbage can. If ice is at hand, the 
washed and drained leaves should be put into cheesecloth 
bags, so that they will not fall out and clog the refriger- 
ator drain, and be placed next to the ice. Or, if there is 
plenty of room, they may be crisped in one of the wire 
salad baskets so much used in Italy and recently intro- 
duced here. If no ice is at hand, wrap the salad loosely 
in paraffine paper, place it in a tightly-covered utensil, 
and set it in the coolest possible place. If the weather is 
not too warm, the green will keep for two days. 

Preparing Salad Ingredients 

The preparation of the various salad ingredients de- 
mands a little time, but the result is well worth the effort. 
A tomato salad, served skin and all, for instance, may be 
quickly prepared, but the skin is indigestible, and its re- 
moval will not only make the salad more appetizing, but 
will lift it above the restaurant level. A good way to 
remove tomato skins is to bruise the fruit with the blunt 
edge of a knife, when the tomato may be easily peeled. 
By this method none of the flavor is lost. A quicker 
method is to use boiling water; if properly done, the 
flavor is not greatly affected. Put the tomatoes into a 
wire basket, plunge them into boiling water and let stand 
one minute, and then immerse in cold water. Cabbage 
should be shredded fine for salad, rather than chopped. 
It is not necessary to use a special shredder for the pur- 
pose, a very sharp long knife serving to shave the cab- 
bage into tiny shreds. These should be crisped in ice 
water, if possible.. There is no foundation for the old- 
time idea that cucumbers should always be allowed to 
stand for some time in cold, salted water before using. 
They should be crisped in plain ice water, but, if they are 
hard to digest, they may be placed in a cheesecloth bag 
and the juice squeezed out. They will not be crisp, 



SALADS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM 455 

treated in this way, but are usually more digestible. Cel- 
ery for salad should be cut into small dice ; if properly 
prepared, even the outer stalks may be used. The 
grooves should be washed with a brush, the strings re- 
moved by slipping a knife under them at the root-end, 
and pulling toward the top of the stalks; scraping is not 
a good method. Two or three stalks should then be put 
together. They should be held on a board, and the 
stalks be shredded lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 
small uniform pieces. 

Fish, chicken and other meats should be cut in pieces 
about the size of a large pea; if they are too large, the 
dressing does not penetrate them; if too small, or if the 
meat has been put through the food-chopper, the result 
is a pasty mixture, suitable only for sandwich fillings. 

When introducing eggs into a mixed salad, slice them, 
or separate the whites from the yolks, chop the whites, 
coarsely, and mix them with the salad ; rub the hard- 
cooked yolk through a coarse sieve or potato ricer, and 
sprinkle thickly over the top as a garnish. In making 
potato salad it is always better to cut the potatoes small 
and combine them, while still warm, with the onion juice, 
vinegar and oil ; the other ingredients may be added later. 
Parsley, mint, chervil and other herbs should be very 
finely minced after being thoroughly washed and then 
dried. 

Dressing a Salad at the Table 

The best way to prepare a green salad, whether it be 
plain," with herbs, with a combination of tart fruits, or 
with other fresh vegetables, is to dress the salad at the 
table. In this case the salad bowl should be roomy. 
The high bowl on a standard is quite the newest shape. 
In general the bowl should be lined with salad greens, the 
other ingredients, if they are used, being arranged at- 
tractively among the leaves. The oil and vinegar should 
be in cruets and together with the salt, pepper, paprika, 
any other desired condiments, and the salad fork 
and spoon should be set upon a small tray. To 
dress the salad, measure out a half tablespoonful 
of oil for each person to be served. Pour it over 
the salad, add the salt, pepper and other condiments, 
if they are to be used, and toss the salad with the 



456 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

fork and spoon until the leaves begin to look a little 
wilted, then add one-third as much vinegar as oil for 
each person, and mix until it is absorbed. This does not 
take long, if done vigorously. 

The salad can be greatly varied by using various kinds 
of vinegar. Italian vinegar gives an especially smooth, 
pungent dressing, while any of the herb vinegars, such as 
tarragon, nasturtium, celery, mint and so on (any of 
which may be easily made at home) relieve any mo- 
notony. 

When to Use French Dressing 

The question has frequently been asked why it is pref- 
erable to dress the salad at the table, rather than to use a 
French dressing, which is poured over the salad. The 
first method is preferable for delicate greens, because 
they then absorb the dressing, but the regulation French 
dressing should be used in marinating (combining) vari- 
ous salad ingredients, as chicken, veal, potatoes and the 
like, which will readily absorb it without becoming 
wilted. The proportions of oil and vinegar for French 
dressing remain the same as when the salad is dressed at 
the table. 

The Selection of Salad Oil 

The question of oil for salad making is becoming more 
of a problem, as large numbers are beginning to appre- 
ciate the dietetic and gastronomic value of the salad 
dressed with oil. The best uncooked dressings are made 
of genuine olive oil, which is unsurpassed in flavor as 
well as digestibility. However, this is expensive ;' good 
substitutes are peanut-, cottonseed-, and corn-oil. In 
using any of these olive-oil substitutes, a little more acid 
and slightly higher seasonings should be introduced. A 
mixture of one-third highly-flavored Italian olive oil and 
two-thirds of any one of the cheaper oils will give an 
olive oil flavor at a lower cost. This method is used by 
some of the best hotels. 

The Choice of Salad Dressings 

The character of the salad dressing should be dic- 
tated by the place of the salad in the meal. All light 
vegetable salads, those occasionally containing a little 
tart fruit, and those which are to constitute a separate 



SALADS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM 457 

course at a dinner, should be served with French dress- 
ing, or one of its derivatives. The same dressing may 
be used on luncheon or supper salads, if desired, but 
when they are to serve as the main course of the meal, it 
is customary to us a mayonnaise, boiled or cream dress- 
ing. The best rule to follow in deciding on the dressing 
is to keep in mind the actual salad ingredients. If they 
are fat and very rich, a boiled dressing should be selected 
rather than a mayonnaise, which contains a large quan- 
tity of fat. If they are deficient in fat, a mayonnaise 
dressing combines well both dietetically and gastro- 
nomically. For a fruit salad the dressing may consist 
of mayonnaise, either plain or combined with a little 
whipped cream, preferably sour, or it may be of a dis- 
tinctly sweet type as honey salad dressing. 

If a sweet dressing is used, however, the fruit salad 
must act as dessert, rather than a separate course. In 
most cases it is preferable partially to combine the salad 
with a small quantity of French dressing, rather than a 
large quantity of heavier dressing. 

To sum up the requirements for making a " real " 
salad: All the ingredients must be cold, the greens 
should be crisp and dry, the salad should be moist, but 
not " soupy," and, if a substantial salad is made, it 
should be allowed to stand for some time with the dress- 
ing mixed through it. The salad plates should be cold, 
and the salad itself should be attractively arranged and 
garnished, for " the eye does half the eating."

VEGETABLE SALADS 

Vegetable salads may be made in many combinations, 
imagination only being the limit. It is a good plan 
to put washed and dry radishes, white or red, pieces of 
green peppers which may have been left over, or a 
tomato, if there is an extra one at hand, in the salad fyag 
or basket, along with lettuce or other salad greens, and 
before it is realized the ingredients for a delicious vege- 
table salad will be accumulated. Specific recipes are un- 
necessary for simple salads of this type. However, the 
following suggestions will probably assist the imagin- 
ation : 

Lettuce, cress and celery. 

Cress, tomatoes and cucumbers. 

Romaine, sliced radishes and shredded cabbage.

as the dessert course at dinner. 

It must be kept in mind in preparing salads of this 
type that there should be a certain per cent, of hard fruit 
introduced, such as apple, diced fresh pineapple, or, in 
some instances, a little diced celery. This gives sub- 
stance to the salad and relieves the monotonous taste. 
The salad should also be slightly tart. To this end it is 
better to put it together with French fruit dressing which 
contains lemon juice. This is much better in a fruit 
salad than vinegar. If the fruit is very sweet it may be 
allowed to stand with a little plain lemon juice on it be- 
fore arranging for the table. Plain honey salad dress- 
ing, honey cream dressing, boiled oil salad dressing, 
currant or cranberry jelly dressing, mayonnaise, and Bar 
le Due dressing are all suitable for use on fruit salads. 

Plain Fruit Salad 

Pare oranges and separate into sections. Pare grape- 
fruit and separate into " carpels " and shred pineapple 
into sections. Dress each one separately with French 
fruit salad dressing, and arrange them on lettuce leaves 
a grapefruit section, an orange section, and a section 
or two of pineapple for each person. Decorate with 
shredded Maraschino cherries. 

Hawaiian Salad

I cupful diced French endive Malaga grapes

serve with wafers or sweet sandwiches and coffee as a 
dessert.

CHAPTER XVIII 
SANDWICHES 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

Sandwiches deserve to be more generally used than as 
mere adjuncts to the luncheon or picnic basket or acces- 
sories to afternoon tea. Made of wholesome bread, 
spread with delicious butter, and filled with savory meat, 
cheese or nuts, the sandwich affords a perfectly balanced 
meal in itself. 

To this end sandwiches may be divided into four 
classes : 

First: The open sandwich or canape, which has been 
treated in the chapter on Appetizers. 

Second: Substantial luncheon or supper sandwiches, 
such as Club Sandwiches. 

Third : A dainty sandwich, containing only a bite or 
two, used at teas and receptions. 

Fourth: The sweet sandwich, which is sometimes 
used as a dessert substitute. 

Bread is twenty-four hours old before it will slice well 
for sandwiches. In making substantial sandwiches for 
home meals and for lunch boxes, leave the crusts on and 
spread the slice out to the edge with butter then the 
crusts will surely be eaten. However, for dainty after- 
noon sandwiches, the crusts should be removed. In 
making sandwiches with the crusts on, it is easier to but- 
ter the loaf, slice by slice, before cutting. But in mak- 
ing daintily-shaped sandwiches this means a great waste 
of butter, and it is better to shape the bread before 
spreading. The butter should be beaten to a cream, as 
in making cake, arid in many cases the sandwich filling 
may be beaten into the butter to good advantage, thus 
making necessary only one spreading. In case great 
economy is being practised, a good oleomargarine may 
replace butter in sandwich-making. 

498 



SANDWICHES 499 

Occasionally, flavored butters are used in sandwiches 
which are to be served with fish, cocktails or salads. 

Sandwiches may be served on doily-covered plates or 
in the newer sandwich trays or baskets. However, 
sweet and savory sandwiches should not be mixed. 
Savory sandwiches may be garnished with radish roses, 
celery tips, heart leaves of lettuce, etc., whereas sweet 
sandwiches may be appropriately garnished with flowers. 

In the following recipes many of the substantial sand- 
wich fillings may be adapted to small and dainty sand- 
wiches, by reducing the quantities, slicing the bread very 
thin, and making sure that the filling itself is very smooth 
and pasty. The substantial sandwich should be made 
coarser in character, as otherwise it is liable to be eaten 
too quickly. It is necessary to have a very smooth fill- 
ing in order to spread the dainty sandwich smoothly. 

After the sandwiches are made they may be kept 
moist for some time, if wrapped carefully in paraffine 
paper and stored in a tightly closed utensil. Or, they 
may be kept even over night, if wrapped in a napkin 
wrung out of hot water, and then set in a closed tin box 
or jar. 

Sweet sandwiches may take the place of cake at many 
meals, and they are a good vehicle for utilizing stale 
sponge or angel cake which may be toasted ; for the util- 
izing of left-over frosting, together with crackers, or for 
the making of a quick sweet combination, such as dates 
and saltine crackers. These sweet sandwiches are par- 
ticularly delicious with hot cocoa or chocolate, or with 
a fruit " ade " for the piazza luncheon.

CHAPTER XIX 
DESSERTS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

We are apt to think of desserts more as accessories 
than as foods, and it is because of this that the sweet, 
which is so often tacked on at the end of a meal, fre- 
quently upsets the digestion. 

All desserts have a food value which may be definitely 
classified according to the predominating element of 
which the dessert is made. For instance, a baked cus- 
tard which is composed largely of eggs and milk is a 
protein, or muscle-making, dessert, although it of course 
contains quick energy in the form of sugar, and fat from 
the egg yolks and the milk. Desserts which are largely 
made up of starch, like tapioca, corn starch puddings, 
etc., may be roughly classified as starches. Those con- 
taining a goodly percentage of fat, as suet pudding, may 
be known as fatty desserts, whereas gelatines may be 
classified as sweets and mineral desserts. 

The dessert to be chosen to supplement the meal must 
be selected with this idea in mind. A careful study of 
the chapter on the Balanced Ration will assist in the 
classification pf these desserts. It should be kept in 
mind that acid desserts, as a fruit gelatine, should sup- 
plement meals rich in fat, or those containing fish. 

Cold desserts may be used when the balance of the 
meal has been hot, and hot desserts will give the tem- 
perature balance to a meal that has largely been cold. 
For this reason it is more satisfying to serve a simple hot 
pudding, as Baked Indian Pudding, rather than the pro- 
verbial sauce and cake at the end of a cold supper.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR GELATINES, 
SPONGES AND BAVARIAN CREAMS 

It is not at all necessary to follow cut and dried recipes 
in the making of gelatines, if one keeps constantly 
in mind the fact that a tablespoonful of powdered gela- 
tine, dissolved in a little cold water, is enough to stiffen 
a pint of liquid. For a fruit gelatine the fruit flavoring 
should be pronounced, and the mixture should be made a 
little sweeter than would seem necessary, that is, if it 
is tested while hot. The fruit juices should never be 
added to a hot liquid. To develop a gelatine into a 
sponge, merely reduce one-fourth the amount of liquid 
necessary to make a pint, adding, when cool, one or two 
well-beaten egg whites ; then whip the whole till frothy, 
or add three-fourths cupful of whipped cream to make a 
Bavarian Cream. 

In adding fruits to a gelatine, they should be stirred 
in after the gelatine begins to " set," or to have the con- 
sistency of an egg white. However, if the gelatine is to 
be moulded, and it is desirable to have a particularly 
attractive result, a thin layer of the gelatine mixture 
should be poured into the bottom of a mould, and the 
mould should be set in cracked ice. When this layer has 
stiffened, a layer of fruit shonld be set in place in an 
attractive design, and a little more gelatine should be 
poured over it. When this has become slightly " set," 
more fruit, nuts, or whatever is to be used, may be put in 
position. This process must be continued until the mould 
is complete. 

A plain lemon or orange gelatine offers a splendid me- 
dium for using up odds and ends of fresh or cooked 
fruit. To this may be added as fancy and necessity of 
balancing the meal may dictate, quartered dates, broken 
nut meats, marshmallows, etc. 

It is oftentimes a great convenience and just as econom- 
ical to use commercially prepared quick gelatine mix- 
tures that are put- in packages with all the ingredients 
exactly prepared for^instant use. In selecting a gelatine 
of this type be sure that it is of undoubted purity, free 
from coal tar dye, and flavored with genuine condensed 
fruit juices. 



DESSERTS 543 

TO PREPARE GELATINE MOULDS 

The gelatine moulds should be rubbed lightly with 
olive oil before the gelatine is put in. This makes the 
unmoulding very easy, and obviates the necessity for hot 
cloths, dipping the moulds in hot water, and the like. 

Lemon Jelly 

2 tablespoonfuls granulated 2.\ cupfuls boiling water 

gelatine I cupful sugar 

1 cupful cold water i cupful lemon juice 

Soak the gelatine five minutes in cold water; dissolve 
in the boiling water, strain and add to the sugar ; cook, and 
add the lemon juice. Turn into moulds and chill. Serve 
with custard or stewed or sliced and sweetened fruit. 

Orange Jelly 

2 tablespoonfuls granulated i| cupfuls boiling water 
gelatine I cupful granulated sugar 

1 cupful cold water 3 tablespoonfuls lemon juice 
ii cupfuls orange juice 

Soak the gelatine five minutes in cold water. Dissolve 
in the boiling water, and add to the sugar, cool and add 
the fruit juices ; pour into mould and let chill. 

Orange and Date Jelly 

Prepare the mixture for Orange Jelly, add a little nut- 
meg and, when beginning to congeal, stir in eight stoned

The Beating of Cream 

Every section of the country has on sale different kinds 
of cream, but, generally speaking, light, or single, cream, 
is chosen for coffee, or as an accompaniment to cereals, 
fruits, or desserts, while heavy, or double, cream is used 
for whipping. 

When cream is to be whipped, it should be chilled, 
placed in a deep pitcher or bowl and beaten quickly with 
a Dover egg-beater. Care must be taken not to over- 
beat it, or it will turn granular, and almost to butter. A 
great many cream whips are on the market, but it would 
seem an unnecessary expense to buy one, when the work 
can be done so effectively with an ordinary egg-beater. 
If the whipped cream does not need to be very stiff, it 
may be diluted with one-quarter or even one-half its bulk 
of rich milk. Powdered or confectioner's sugar should 
be added half way during the beating, and the desired 
flavoring during the latter part. 

If the cream is to stand any length of time, dissolve 
a scant half teaspoonful of powdered gelatine in a little 
cold water, steam it over hot water, cool, and stir it 
gradually into the cream while whipping. This is a good 
plan to follow when making a cream cake. 

Flavoring Whipped Cream 

Care must be taken not to overflavor the cream. 
Maraschino flavoring or a dilution of a little very strong 
coffee, instead of the milk, gives a delicious flavor. 
Melted chocolate, which has been allowed to cool, may be 
stirred in, together with a few drops of vanilla, or the 
dilution may take the form of crushed and sifted rasp- 



SWEET SAUCES 561 

berries, peach pulp, fruit pulp of any other fruit desired 
according to the dish which it is to accompany. 

Honey Whipped Cream 

i cupful heavy cream \ tablespoonful lemon juice 

f cupful honey 

Combine the ingredients and whip until stiff.

All the frozen desserts may be classified under the gen- 
eral term " Ices " and are either water ices or cream ices. 
Plain water ices consist of sugar syrups, combined with 
fruit juices, while sherbets are water ices, to which gela- 
tine or whipped egg whites have been added. Cream 
ices include Philadelphia, custard and junket creams, 
milk sherbets, frozen chocolate, mousses and parfaits. 

The principle underlying successful freezing is that of 
latent heat, or evaporation, the ice being combined with 
some material like salt that will cause it to melt, and 
thereby lower the temperature below the thirty-two de- 
grees of the ice. This causes fluids to become solidfied 
by. converting their watery particles to ice, and whether 
or not the mixture is to be smooth, coarse or grainy, or 
half-frozen, depends on the manner of freezing, the 
amount of ice and salt to be used, and whether or not 
they are stirred during the process. 

Unless one owns an ice crusher, which costs about five 
dollars (and worth the price if much ice cream is made) 
there is no better way to crush ice than by using a wooden 
mallet and a canvas bag. If a small quantity is to be 
made, it perhaps is as easy to chip the ice with an ice 
pick. 

Proportions of Ice and Salt for Freezing 

The amount of ice and salt necessary for freezing de- 
pends upon the desired texture of the dessert being made. 
All ice creams, water ices and sherbets should be frozen 
in three parts of ice to one part of salt, by measure. 
Frappes, which are of coarse texture, should be frozen in 
equal parts of ice and salt; and mousses and parfaits, 
which are creams frozen without stirring, should be 
packed in equal parts of ice and salt. In packing cream,

ices, sherbets, etc., after freezing, use four parts of ice 
to one part of salt, and let stand at least an hour to 
mould. 

Freezing Creams 

Fill the freezer can only three-fourths full, as the ice 
increases in bulk during the freezing, and, if the can is 
crowded, the dessert will be coarse grained. Then set 
the, can in place, adjust the dasher and handle, and pack 
in layers with ice and salt, to the top, if the freezer is to 
be filled ; just cover the mixture line, if a smaller amount 
is being prepared. Then set the freezer in a dish pan on 
a table or stool, so that it will be of convenient height, 
and turn the crank, slowly at first, then more rapidly, 
when the ice is frozen to a mush. If cream is to be 
frozen frequently, a stationary box of correct height 
with screw eyes should be arranged. The freezer should 
have two links attached, so that it will not be necessary to 
hold it during the freezing process. The water should 
never be drawn off, unless it is liable to overflow into the 
can, for it is extremely cold and is the vehicle which 
freezes the cream. It should freeze in fifteen to twenty 
minutes, if a modern freezer is used. When the cream 
is done, draw off the water, remove and scrape the dasher, 
cork the top of the can, and re-pack; then cover with 
sacking or old carpet to retain the cold air, and let stand 
to become smooth or " ripen." 

Packing and Freezing Mousses and Parfaits 

Dip the mould in cold water, fill with the mixture, 
cover with paraffine paper and press on the lid, letting 
the paper project. If the lid fits tight, no further sealing 
is necessary, but, if it is a little loose, bind the opening 
with adhesive tape, or smear it with lard, and bind 
around with a strip of cloth. 

Pack in equal parts of ice and salt, packing them in 
layers rather than mixing together. Let stand from 
three to four hours to become solid. 

Moulding Ices 

Have the mould chilled, and pack in the frozen mixture 
Very solidly, heaping it slightly above the edges. Cover 



564 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

with waxed paper, which protrudes a little over the edge, 
and close the mould. Bury as directed in four parts of 
ice to one of salt. To unmould, rinse with cold water, re- 
move the cover, invert the mould on the service platter 
and let it stand exposed to the heat of the room for a few 
moments.

SUNDAES OR COLLEGE ICES 

Sundaes may be easily made at home from a founda- 
tion cream, at much less expense than when purchased at 
a soda fountain. The number is legion, the limit to 
imagination alone curtailing the varieties that may be 
made. 

The following combinations may prove useful in sug- 



580 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

gesting various types which may be easily and quickly 
prepared. They are usually served in sherbert or frappe 
glasses. These may be procured as low as ten cents 
apiece in various styles.

CHAPTER XXII 
CAXE 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

Cake unfortunately is used in the menu more as an 
accessory than a food, and* is often the last morsel of the 
meal that overtaxes an already overburdened digestive 
system. This is undoubtedly the reason why many per- 
sons feel that they cannot eat it. When made with fat, 
it will take longer to digest than when made without ; but 
this is no reason why anyone with normal digestion 
should not eat cake, provided it does not destroy the bal- 
ance of the menu. It is largely made up of carbohy- 
drates, as sugar and flour, which are energy makers. 
The ordinary loaf, therefore, which contains only one or 
two eggs to represent the proteins, must be classified as 
a heat maker, and, when it is used, especially if covered 
with a thick icing, it should not be accompanied by a 
second sweet for dessert. However, if very rich in eggs, 
as are sponge and angel cake, or in nuts, it may be used 
as a supplement to the proteins of the meal. 

Preparation of Utensils 

It is easy to make good cake, if care is exercised. 
Choose a reliable recipe and read it carefully. Be sure 
that all the necessary ingredients are at hand, and that 
the process of putting the mixture together is thoroughly 
understood, for this has much to do with the texture 
of the finished product. Then prepare the pans. In 
making any loaf cake containing fat, the bottom of the 
pan should be lined with paper not a scrap from the 
dry-goods bundle which has passed through many hands 
of questionable cleanliness, but a fresh piece from a supply 
kept for the purpose. Better still, purchase the " stick- 
less " vegetable parchment papers. In making layer or 
cup cakes, the pans should be merely oiled^ and then 

583 



584 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

dusted with flour to form a thin film. Butter should 
never be used for oiling pans, as it burns readily, and 
imparts a conspicuously salty, fried taste to the outside 
of the cake. Either lard or a reliable vegetable fat is 
a much better choice. A little basket of clean scraps of 
paper hung near the cooking table will make the oiling of 
the pans easy. 

Many experts suggest as the next step the measuring 
of all ingredients before mixing, but I have yet to find a 
practical housewife who will do this; the objection being 
that it means the use of unnecessary dishes. However, 
all the things should be placed on the cooking table to 
facilitate the mixing. The heavy stone cake bowl, be- 
loved by many housewives, is strictly taboo in my kitchen, 
because it is clumsy and hard to handle; a far bet- 
ter choice is a good-sized saucepan, of suitable depth, 
with a rounded bottom, the handle being a great help in 
holding the utensil firmly while creaming the butter and 
beating the batter. A wooden spoon, spatula shape, is 
the most adequate tool for the mixing, because of its 
long handle, lightness, and the fact that it is almost 
noiseless. 

Putting the Cake Together 

Having prepared the pan, assembled the ingredients, 
and chosen the mixing utensils, the next step is to sit 
down and measure out the fat. If the fat is very hard, 
the mixing pan may be rinsed with boiling water, dried, 
and the fat broken in pieces and left there to soften, but 
it should never be melced unless specified in the recipe, 
and then it should be cooled before being added to the 
cake. 

Measure the liquid required in the cup which was 
used for the fat. The flour should be sifted onto a 
good-sized piece of paper, then measured, and the ex- 
cess put back into the flour receptacle. Put the meas- 
ured flour on another piece of paper, together with the 
salt (for a little salt is indispensable in every cake, 
whether or not butter is used), and the baking powder, 
or the combination of soda and cream of tartar, or soda 
alone, according to the requirements. Spices should 
also be added to this mixture, and, if nuts or fruit are 
called for; they should be thoroughly blended with the 



CAKE 585 

flour. It is not necessary to add extra flour to them. 
By this time the gas oven should be lighted (allowing 
ten minutes for it to heat), unless it has a direct heat 
action, while a wood or coal oven should have been 
brought to the right temperature. Now the fat will be 
sufficiently softened by the heat in the room to be easily 
creamed. It should be stirred until as soft as cold cream, 
and then the sugar should be beaten in until all grainy tex- 
ture is lost. It does not take any longer to do this than it 
does to put the sugar and the fat together in the first 
place and try to smooth out the lumps. The next step, if 
whole eggs are to be used, is to beat and add them to 
this mixture. Melted chocolate or cocoa should be 
added at this time. If the eggs are separated, the whites 
are usually folded in last, after being beaten stiff, since 
they act as part of the leavening. If a cake of very solid 
texture is desired, the eggs may be creamed in, one at a 
time, without being beaten. 

Now add the flavoring, and be sure that enough is put 
in to give the cake a distinctive taste. Sometimes, a 
blend may be used to give variety, as a few drops of 
vanilla, half the amount of orange, and a drop or two of 
almond extract. Or the cake may have its own char- 
acteristic flavoring, as caramel, chocolate, or coffee, when 
the amount of extra flavoring must be very sparingly 
used, in order to augment, and not overbalance, the de- 
sired taste. Lemon or orange rind may be added, or, 
better still, a few drops of the new orange or lemon oil. 
After this the flour mixture and the liquid should be 
added alternately, beginning with the flour, to prevent 
the re-congealing of the fat, which takes place when the 
cold liquid is added first. The more the cake is beaten 
at this time the finer-grained it will be. As soon as the 
mixing process is completed the cake should be poured 
into the pan. 

Putting the Cake into the Pan 

The batter should be so thick that it is necessary to 
spread it, and it should be made a little higher on the 
edges and at the corners than in the center, so that the 
cake, when baked, will be level. If this is not done, it 
bakes more quickly at the edges, since it takes the heat 



586 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

longer to penetrate to the middle, therefore causing a 
slower expansion of the gas formed in the cake, with the 
familiar " mountainous ridge " result. This ridge is 
sometimes caused by too much flour, but, as a general 
rule, it is due to the carelessness in putting the mixture 
into the pans for baking. Sogginess is usually caused by 
too little flour, too much sugar, too much fat, or under- 
cooking. 

Baking Cake 

The proper oven temperature depends upon the kind 
of cake to be baked; for fruit cake, or a rich wedding 
cake, demanding two or more hours' cooking, the oven 
should be very slow, about 225 degrees F. For sponge 
or angel cake the temperature should be higher, about 
300 degrees F. ; for loaf cake about 350 degrees F., and 
for layer and cup cakes 375 degrees F. In using gas a 
small pan of cold water, or a pan of custard surrounded 
by water, or some apples to bake, should be put in along 
with the cake to provide a more moist heat. 

During the first quarter of the time the cake should 
rise, little bubbles appearing all over the top. It may be 
moved as desired during this period. During the second 
quarter of the baking time it should rise to its full height 
and brown in spots. During the third quarter it should 
brown all over, and, during the last, it stops steaming, 
shrinks away from the sides of the pan, and rebounds 
when lightly touched. If it is necessary to use a still 
further test, plunge a common steel hat pin or knitting- 
needle into the cake; if it comes out free of dough, the 
cake is done. The cake should be allowed to stand for 
at least five minutes, after removing from the oven, be- 
fore being turned from the pan, and should cool on a 
wire cake rack, so that there will be a circulation of air 
about it. If a boiled icing is to be used, it should be 
put on the cake after it has cooled ; an uncooked icing 
may be spread on a warm or cold cake. Although a 
frosting adds to the deliciousness of the cake, there are 
many times when it may be omitted, the cake fitting into 
the meal to better advantage without it. 

The Choice of Ingredients 

The choice of flour has its effect on the cake; a good 



CAKE 587 

winter wheat or pastry flour gives a much more tender 
texture than bread flour because it contains less gluten. 
Good butter lends a peculiar richness, when used in 
large quantities, as in making pound cake. But, gen- 
erally speaking, oleomargarine may be used in precisely 
the same quantities as butter ; lard and beef fat in half 
the quantity of butter ; and the vegetable oils and chicken 
fat in about two-thirds the proportion of butter. All of 
these give good results, provided the cake is carefully 
made and the fat of good quality. If nuts or cocoanut 
are added to a cake formula, the amount of shortening 
should be reduced one-eighth, as both these ingredients 
contain fat. 

Whatever kind of sugar is used, it must be free from 
lumps. Brown sugar makes a moist cake, and pow- 
dered sugar one that is dry. Fine granulated sugar is 
the best for general purposes. Sweet milk is the best 
liquid for cake, a half cupful being the right proportion 
for a cupful and a half of flour. Water or cold coffee 
may be substituted, if a tablespoonful less is used, but 
the texture will not be so fine. Cocoa, or potato, or rice, 
or macaroni water (water in which potatoes, macaroni 
or rice have been boiled) may be cooled and used in the 
same quantity as milk. If cream is substituted for milk, 
the amount of shortening must be decreased, and the 
amount of liquid increased, one-half cupful of light 
cream being equal to six tablespoonfuls of milk and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Sour milk and buttermilk may 
be used interchangeably; they make a very tender cake. 
If the milk is not very sour, the method may be that fol- 
lowed with sweet milk, provided it is neutralized with a 
little soda, one-fourth teaspoonful usually sufficing to 
sweeten a cupful of the sour liquid. The amount of 
baking powder used should then be decreased a tea- 
spoonful to every fourth teaspoonful of soda added to 
the sour milk. 



CAKES MADE WITHOUT SHORTENING 

There are only a few cakes which can be made without 
shortening. These include those of the sponge variety, 
angel and sunshine cakes, and all of them depend largely 



588 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

for their lightness upon the amount of air that is beaten 
into the egg whites. In some cases a little baking pow- 
der is introduced to lessen the number of eggs, which 
would otherwise be necessary to make a light cake. But 
the real, old-fashioned cake of this type contains no arti- 
ficial leavening. 

Quickness in putting a cake of this type together is the 
first step towards success. If possible, .pans should be 
kept only for these cakes, and should never be oiled, but, 
if this is impracticable, it will be necessary to oil and 
slightly flour the pans, if butter cakes have been baked in 
them. After measuring out the various ingredients, 
creaming or beating the egg yolks as the case may be, 
together with the sugar, and making all possible prep- 
arations, the egg whites may be whipped stiff by means of 
a flat wire whisk, which beats in approximately a third 
more air than the ordinary egg-beater, therefore making 
the cake rise to greater height. As soon as put together, 
the cake should be transferred to the pan and slipped into 
a very slow oven. Some authorities advocate a cold 
oven in starting the cake ; this also gives good results. 
The heat should be moderated so that it will reach three 
hundred degrees after the loaf has been in about fifteen 
minutes. An average-sized loaf of sponge, angel, or 
sunshine cake should bake from fifty minutes to an hour, 
and should rise to twice its bulk. Invert as soon as it 
comes from the oven, and the cake will usually come 
out by itself, if allowed to stand some little time. If it 
does not loosen and begin to come out within a half 
hour, run a sharp knife around the edge, but do not 
jam the cake.

CHAPTER XXIV 
ICINGS AND FILLINGS 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

It is unnecessary to ice a cake to have it look attrac- 
tive ; in fact, cake which is iced should be used only when 
it is to act as the sweet in the meal. If a plain layer 
cake is made, it can be attractively garnished with pow- 
dered sugar sifted on evenly just before serving, or a 
few broken nut meats finely chopped, or candied fruit, 
may be sprinkled over the mixture before it is put in the 
oven to bake, the rough edges making a pretty finish. 
Or, a combination of chopped almonds and granulated 
sugar may be substituted. This is very attractive on 
small cakes. It is a good plan to spread the top very 
lightly with jelly, egg white or honey before sprinkling 
the sugar on a cooked cake, as this will stick it in place. 

The easiest icings are those which need no cooking. 
They may be made with either water, cream, cold coffee, 
butter, fruit juices, or egg white, but in making them only 
confectioner's or XXXX sugar should be used. This 
should be sifted, or, if very lumpy, rolled, and then sifted 
before adding to the liquid. 

To Ice a Cake 

To ice a cake to the best advantage, it should be at 
least twenty-four hours old. First brush off the crumbs. 
If an elaborate cake is being made, it is always best to 
put a preliminary plain confectioner's icing to " stick in 
the crumbs." This makes a hard surface, to which the 
ornamental icing can be applied. Put the cake on a box, 
or an icing stand, with a plate beneath it to catch all the 
extra icing that may drop off, as this can be used over 
and over. Spread the icing with a broad-bladed knife, 
or, better still, a spatula, as this is limber, dipping it first 

620 



ICINGS AND FILLINGS 621 

in hot water. This can be done in using either cooked 
or uncooked icing. All, of course, must be in place 
before the icing is " set." If a design is to be applied, 
first put on a plain icing, and, when almost dry, trace on 
it the design, or the place where the fruit, etc., is to be 
applied, so that it will be even when finished. 

To make an attractive looking cake, it 'is not at all 
necessary to use a pastry bag and tube to apply the ordi- 
nary ornamental icing, for most attractive results can be 
gained by using little candies which can be made into 
flower designs of roses, holly, mistletoe, etc., with the 
aid of leaves and stems cut from angelica to give the 
green necessary. 

To Prepare Angelica 

Scald it in hot water, dry it thoroughly on cheesecloth 
or paper towels, and then cut in the desired shapes. 

Using a Pastry Bag and Tubes 

Choose a bag made of heavy duck. The necessary 
tubes are the Star, Rose Leaf tube, a small plain tube, 
and a large plain tube. More may be added as desired ; or 
a pastry tube outfit may be purchased. This is a Swedish 
invention and is arranged so that the filling or a frost- 
ing, or whatever it is to be piped on, is put in a tin cylin- 
der ; the tubes fit tightly into place in the bottom, and the 
piston, which is easily operated by the hand, presses out 
the mixture evenly. 

To use a bag and tube, adjust the tube firmly in posi- 
tion ; make sure that it will not slip out of the opening at 
the base of the bag. To this end it is best to purchase 
a ring, which will fit into the end of the bag, into which 
the tube may be tightly fitted. Fill the bag a scant half 
full of the mixture, twist the top of the bag with the 
right hand and guide the tube with the left, forcing out 
the mixture by a gentle pressure with the right hand. It 
is impossible to give absolute directions for the making 
of the different shapes and designs with a pastry bag 
and tube. The best method, if a lesson cannot be taken 
from some expert in this line, is for the housewife to 
make up the recipe for Duchess potato. This can be ex- 
perimented with over and over again as long as it is kept 



622 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

hot, and it is a very easy matter to find out just what can 
be done with the tubes.

CHAPTER XXV 
PASTRY 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

The making of pastry is a rock on which many house- 
wives stumble. There are several reasons for this ; prob- 
ably the most pertinent is that most women feel that the 
making of pie, or anything allied to it, is a very difficult 
task, success being given to only a chosen few. Another 
reason is because this fearful, heavy mental attitude re- 
tards the hand, and, therefore, makes the touch heavy; 
successful pastry cannot be made if the process is drawn 
out, or if it is mussed over. A great deal has been said 
about the necessity for chilling all the utensils, using ice 
water, etc., but when we remember what delicious pies we 
have frequently eaten, which were made by old-fashioned 
cooks who heeded neither cold nor measurement in par- 
ticular, we can see that this argument does not hold 
good. Any woman, given a good recipe, and working 
quickly, can make a delicious pie, provided she under- 
stands the baking. Pastry flour gives the best results. 

Pastry enough for two or three bakings may be made 
at a time, rolled up, dusted with a little flour, and set 
in a cool place in a covered utensil until needed. Or, if 
desired, several extra patty shells may be baked at once, 
stored in a tin box, and kept a week or two before using; 
re-heating will make them as delicious as when freshly 
made. This is an especially good plan to follow during 
the berry season, when a strawberry or raspberry tart 
may be made in a, few minutes if the shell is ready. 

Putting the Pie Together 

It is not necessary to oil a pie plate, for there is enough 
fat in the crust to make this unnecessary. Probably the 
most satisfactory pie plates are in the new cooking glass 

630 



PASTRY 631 

and it is an especially attractive ware, if the pie plate is 
to appear on the table. 

The brown earthen plates, which are quite deep, and 
which fit into silver or nickle holders, are also excellent 
for thick pies, like custard or lemon. 

The crust should be rolled out to a scant one-eighth 
of an inch, or pasteboard, thickness. In lining the plate, 
lay the crust on, loosely. Do not make it taut or it will 
crisp and break during the baking. Cut it off to within 
one-fourth of an inch of the edge of the plate by means 
of scissors. If a berry or other juicy pie is being made, 
bestrew the bottom crust with a few fine dry bread 
crumbs, or cracker crumbs, or a little flour. This will 
absorb at once the excessive moisture and prevent the 
crust from being soaked. Or, the bottom crust may be 
" painted " with a little unbeaten egg white, which will 
coagulate as soon as the heat reaches it and make an 
impervious coating. After the filling is put in, the top 
crust may be put in position. This should also be rolled 
to pasteboard thickness, and, like the bottom crust, 
should extend from one-eighth to one-fourth inch beyond 
the edge of the plate. The extending edge of the lower 
crust should be lightly rubbed with cold water before 
placing on the top crust, which should be cut in the 
middle according to the time-honored custom, to allow 
for the emission of steam, as, otherwise, this is liable to 
make the crust soggy inside. 

To achieve an appetizing brown result, brush the pie 
lightly with milk before putting it in the oven. It may 
be dotted with butter or other fat, as well, which will 
make it look a little more flaky, but this is not necessary. 
If dotted with fat alone, it will look spotty. 

If a very juicy pie is to be made, it is sometimes neces- 
sary to bind the outer edge of the plate with a thin strip 
of cloth (or " finger bandage " if expense does not have 
to be considered). To do this, press together the edges 
of the pie, as directed. Have the strip of cloth about an 
inch wide, dip it in water, or milk, and simply bind it 
around the edge of the plate, making it fairly tight. 

In making tart shells, or shells for lemon pie or 
cooked fruit, put the crust, rolled to pasteboard thickness, 
on the inverted plate, putting it on so that it fits, but 



632 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

cutting it off on the bottom even with the edge of the 
plate. Prick it at the flange of the plate with a fork so 
that the expansion of the air underneath will not cause 
it to rise irregularly in bubbles, and prick it occasionally 
on the top (that is the inverted bottom), and also a few 
times near the edge. 

Baking Pies 

The oven for all pies should be fairly hot at first 
about 375 degrees in order to set the crust so that the 
filling will not soak in. As the filling heats through, the 
heat may be reduced to' about 350 degrees. Squash, 
custard and pumpkin pies, or any pie that contains egg 
as a thickening agent, should not be cooked so rapidly 
that the filling will boil, as this causes separation, and 
will make the pie watery. When done, the center should 
be firm, and a knife, when inserted, will come out clean. 

Thick fruit pies, like an old-fashioned apple pie, or a 
berry pie, will need longer cooking than those that are 
less thick. Generally speaking, a thin apple pie will cook 
in thirty-five to forty minutes; more time should be al- 
lowed for a thicker one. Mince pies, which have a 
cooked filling, will be done in twenty-five minutes ; thick 
fresh fruit pies will need from forty to fifty minutes. 
Custard, squash and pumpkin pies should be baked until 
they are firm in the center, or when a knife, if inserted, 
will come out clean ; this will be in about forty minutes. 

When a pie is to be topped with a meringue, it should 
be put on ten minutes before the pie will be done. The 
finishing must be done in a very slow oven; the secret 
of a good meringue lies in this slow cooking. 

If the following recipe is heeded, and time is allowed 
for cookery, the meringue will be tender, will not fall 
and will not be watery. 

Meringue for Pies and Puddings 

2 egg whites A few drops of flavoring ex- 

2 tablespoonfuls powdered tract or lemon juice 

or confectioner's sugar 

Whip the whites until stiff, but not until they look 
dull, like snow. Then beat in the sugar and flavoring, 
whipping until the mixture looks shiny. Do not have 



PASTRY 633 

the surface upon which the meringue is to be spread too 
hot. Bake in a moderate oven about ten minutes for a 
meringue of moderate thickness longer for a very 
thick meringue. If a larger quantity is desired, use two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar to each additional egg white. If 
over-baked, the meringue will be tough. If under-baked, 
bubbles of liquid will collect on the surface. 

Puff Paste 

2\ cupfuls pastry flour i scant half cupful water 

\ teaspoonful salt ii cupfuls butter 

Sift together the flour and salt and cut in the butter 
with a knife, doing it all on a board. Then take out the 
large floured lumps and heap up the mealy flakes to form 
a well. Stir in ice water to moisten but not to make it 
wet. Flour the mixture a little and roll out to one-half 
inch thickness. Put on this one-half of the floured 
lumps of butter. Fold over the top, press the edges to- 
gether firmly, and roll this into a long strip. Then lay on 
the remaining bits of butter as directed, doubling it in the 
opposite direction. Flour slightly, fold in threes and 
fours, chill for at least one hour and unroll the same way 
in which it is rolled before chilling. 

French Pastry 

The French Pastry which we find in the best hotels 
and tea-rooms has as a foundation the Puff Paste given 
in the preceding recipe. 

The paste may be rolled into squares, or strips, and 
folded over as fancy may dictate, the filling being of 
cooked fruit, jam, marmalade or even a cooked cream 
filling, or sweetened and flavored whipped cream. Any 
of the pastries seen in the hotels may be copied by an 
observing housewife. 

Patty Shells 

Patty shells may be made from the formula for Puff 
Paste. After the paste has been thoroughly chilled, cut 
out rounds one-quarter inch in thickness, and place them 
on a pan lined with brown paper. Lightly rub the edges 
of these rounds with cold water. Then cut out rings 
one-quarter of an inch wide of the pastry of exactly the 



6 3 4 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

same size as the larger rounds. Press one of these 
lightly in position on each of the large rounds. Brush 
this lightly with a little cold water. Bake in a moderate 
oven about thirty-five minutes, covering the shells with 
paper during the preliminary cooking. They will raise 
and be flaky and may be used with a filling of oysters, 
creamed sweetbreads, chicken and mushrooms, or with 
crushed and sweetened fruit of any kind. If higher 
patty shells are desired, put on two of the narrow rounds 
of pastry instead of one. 

Short-Cut Pastry 

3 tablespoonfuls chicken fat i cupful pastry flour 
or i teaspoonful salt 

5 tablespoonfuls lard 

Sift together the flour and salt and stir in the chicken 
fat (or the chicken fat substitute melted to the consist- 
ency of chicken fat). It must not be hot. Moisten with 
cold water till of the consistency to roll. Roll out and 
use. This makes a very tender crust and is enough for 
one pie. 

Flaky Pastry 

1 cupful pastry flour About 6 tablespoonfuls cold 
5 tablespoonfuls lard water 

2 teaspoonful salt 

Combine the salt and flour and work in one-half the 
lard with the finger tips, keeping the mixture coarse and 
flaky. Moisten the dough with ice water, turn on a 
slightly-floured board, dust with flour, pat and roll out. 
Fold in the remaining lard (which should be rather soft) 
by placing the other half of the crust over it; press the 
edges together firmly to incase as much air as possible, 
press with the rolling pin and roll it out. Fold again and 
roll. Do this three times. This quantity will make one 
pie with two crusts, or one pie with the crust built up. 

Short Biscuit Paste for Meat or Fish Pies 

2! cupfuls bread flour 6 tablespoonfuls butter or 

4 teaspoonfuls baking pow- oleomargarine 
der i teaspoonful salt 

Milk to make a stiff dough 

Mix and sift the flour, salt and baking powder. Work 



PASTRY 635 

in 4 tablespoonfuls of the butter and moisten to make a 
stiff dough. Turn onto a floured board, pat to one- 
quarter inch thickness, and spread with I tablespoon ful 
of butter ; fold over, roll out and repeat with the remain- 
ing butter. Fold, roll, and cut in desired shape.

into a plate lined with flaky pastry. Bake until firm in 
the center, then cover with a meringue made of the egg 
whites, 3 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and a few 
drops of lemon juice. Finish in a slow oven. Serve 
cold. 

Double Apple Pie 

Butter two pie plates of corresponding size. Fill each 
with sliced, tart apples, mixed with a cupful of sugar and

Put the suet through the food chopper. Pare, core 
and quarter the apples, removing all the hulls; chop a 
little coarser than the meat. Add the other ingredients 
(except the spices), and i|- cupfuls of meat stock. Heat 
gradually, stir occasionally, and cook slowly two hours. 
Then add the spices and the grape juice. 

Lemon Mince Meat 

2 lemons I pound currants 

6 apples, chopped i pound raisins 

pound suet, chopped 2 ounces citron, shredded 

ii cupfuls sugar 

Boil the lemon peel until very tender, then chop fine, 
reserving the liquor; add to the other ingredients together 
with the lemon juice, moisten with the liquor, and use as 
any mince meat. 

Cream Puffs 

i cupful butter i cupful pastry flour 

i cupful boiling water 4 eggs 

Boil the water and butter together in a saucepan. Add 
the flour all at once, and stir until the mixture leaves the 
sides of the pan. Remove from the heat, cool for five 
minutes and stir in thoroughly one unbeaten egg at a 
time. Butter a baking sheet and set the mixture in 
rounds about two inches in diameter, leaving at least two 
inches between them. Bake thirty minutes in a mod- 
erate oven and, when cold, split on the side and fill with 
whipped cream, which has been sweetened, and into 
which a little strong coffee and a few drops of vanilla 
have been beaten. Frost the top of each with a teaspoon- 
ful of coffee icing. Or, fill with a cooked cream, or 
fresh sugared fruit. 

Eclairs 

Make according to the preceding Cream Puff recipe, 
only shape with a spoon into long strips, or use a large, 
plain pastry tube for shaping. Bake as cream puffs. 
Just before serving time, split and fill with a cooked- 
cream filling, cooked-coffee filling, or with crushed and 
sweetened fruit. In the latter case, serve with whipped 
cream. If the eclairs are to be iced, spread on the frost- 
ing while they are still a little warm. 



CHAPTER XXVI 
THE MAKING OF CANDIES 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

The making of candies at home is, unfortunately, gen- 
erally considered such a task that it is seldom done ; per- 
haps because most of the recipes for home-made candies 
are too complicated and the results gained are not nearly 
so palatable as when the candies are purchased ready 
made. But when it is realized that most of the candies 
on sale contain impure and injurious substances, which 
cannot help but tear down or harm the tissues of the 
body, any mother will count it worth while to make can- 
dies for her children, unless she is absolutely sure of the 
purity of the commercial product. Or, better still, she 
will teach the children themselves to make the candies, 
giving them the double joy of creating and partaking. 

The " penny candy habit " is especially to be con- 
demned. Although there are a few grades of pure can- 
dies on the market, they are usually high-priced and 
almost never on sale at a penny a piece. The majority 
of the manufacturers of cheap candies do not hesitate to 
use any material to produce an alluring effect. Shellac, 
glue, talcum, paraffine, stearin, artificial chocolate made 
from iron oxide and cocoa shells, lamp black, sulphurous 
acid, coal tar dyes and the whole gamut of flavoring 
ethers contribute to make these candies lurid and tempt- 
ing to the child who is taught to judge by appearance 
rather than by substance. For example, shellac is used 
to coat candies, like burned peanuts or "Boston baked 
beans," to render them impervious to dampness and to 
keep them perpetually fresh. Shellac contains wood 
alcohol a deadly poison and yet such candies are 
constantly being bought by children. 

As a general rule a child that is properly fed will not 

644 



THE MAKING OF CANDIES 645 

require excess sweets unless he is very active, and they 
may then be introduced in the form of dates, old-fash- 
ioned molasses candy (made from Barbadoes molasses), 
home-made, sugared popcorn, maple syrup, or any of the 
maple syrup candies. If the child is allowed the ines- 
timable privilege of making it himself, the candy will be- 
come the greatest treat possible. Give the child enough 
sweets with his meals to balance his desire in the form 
of bread and jam, home-made biscuits and honey or 
maple syrup, fresh fruits, and stewed, sun-dried fruits. 
After school answer the clamor for " a penny to spend " 
with a generous slice of bread and butter thick with 
brown, or scraped maple, sugar, or a date and nut sand- 
wich and keep him away from the corner store. If 
a child is well-nourished and not taught to eat candy, he 
will not demand it. 

Packing Home-Made Candies 

Home-made candies, if to act as gifts, should be at- 
tractively packed. It is not always possible to duplicate 
the commercial package at home, but, if care is taken in 
shaping and cutting, the receptacle bears a touch of gar- 
niture which is appropriate and the value of the gift is 
greatly enhanced. Decorated boxes may be obtained in 
almost any size desired, from five cents up, while plain 
white ones may be obtained at less cost. If the latter 
are wrapped in pale green tissue paper, tied with a gilt 
or silver cord, with a sprig of holly, or other green, or 
flowers tucked in the knot, it will look attractive. Heart- 
shaped seals may hold the card in place at the Valentine 
season ; holly seals at Christmas, and so on, each season 
of the year being appropriately indicated by the wrap- 
ping. 

Occasionally it is desirable to add a gift with the 
candies. In this case they may be packed in tiny splint 
baskets, or those of the wicker type, shallow ones being 
especially suitable for stuffed fruits, candied orange peel 
and candies of irregular size, while deeper ones are better 
suited to regularly shaped sweets, as nut fudge, etc. 
Pretty little glass jars may also be found as low as 
twenty-five cents. While alone they may not be enough 
to act as a gift, if filled with home-made mints, or winter- 



646 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

greens, and tied with a bow of ribbon, they become really 
attractive gifts. Various china dishes and glass bowls, 
plain, or of a silver deposit, may be obtained at a similar 
price, and filled with candies of suitable size. 

Cretonne-covered boxes, which may be used later for 
handkerchiefs or gloves, are attractive for this purpose, 
while, if candy is to be given to a child, it could be piled 
into a five-cent sand pail, or heaped into a ten-cent 
wooden automobile, or a cart with a horse attached. Or, 
pop-corn balls may be wrapped in paraffine paper and 
fastened with seals, and if desired they may hold a sur- 
prise in the center, as a marshmallow, a chocolate cream 
or a stuffed date. 

Using the Sugar Thermometer 

Candy may be successfully made without a sugar ther- 
mometer, but the use of the thermometer obviates the 
close watching that is otherwise necessary. The follow- 
ing table explains the terms used in candy making, to- 
gether with the degrees on the thermometer: 

Thread stage, 220 to 225 degrees F., or when a thread 
hangs from the spoon, when it is lifted from the syrup. 

Soft Ball stage, 238 to 240 degrees F., or when a soft 
ball is formed when a little of the syrup is dropped in 
cold water. 

" Chewy Ball " stage, 250 to 252 degrees F., or when a 
fairly hard ball is formed when a little of the mixture is 
tried in cold water. 

Crack Stage, 290 to 300 degrees F., or when a little of 
the mixture rattles against the cup when tried in cold 
water. 

White Fondant 

2\ pounds granulated sugar, \\ cupfuls hot water 

or 5 cupfuls i teaspoonful cream of tartar 

Put the ingredients into a smooth saucepan. Stir until 
dissolved, and heat gradually to boiling point. Boil 
without stirring until, when tried in cold water, a soft 
ball may be formed that will keep its shape. The tem- 
perature will be 238 degrees F. If the sugar adheres to 
the sides of the kettle, remove with a piece of wet cheese- 
cloth. Pour slowly onto a slightly-oiled slab, or a large 
platter, oiled. Let it stand for a few minutes to cool, or 



THE MAKING OF CANDIES 647 

until when pressed with the finger a dent is left on the 
surface, and yet no crust is formed. If stirred while too 
hot, it will grain. If a crust forms, every particle must 
be taken off, or else the boiling must be done again. 
When it will dent, scrape the fondant together and work 
with a wooden spoon or spatula, until it is white and 
creamy. It will quickly change from this consistency, 
so begin kneading while it is still creamy, otherwise it 
will lump, and will be difficult to handle. Scrape the 
slab and knead the scrapings separately. Do not mix the 
fondant unless it is perfectly free from lumps. Put it 
into a bowl, cover with oiled paper or a damp cloth and 
let stand twenty-four hours before using. 

Before using fondant for dipping it must be put over 
hot water and steamed, and it may be necessary to add a 
very little hot water to allow for the evaporation which 
will take place while the fondant is being kept hot. Fon- 
dant may be kept an indefinite time, if closely covered 
with a damp cloth and then with a cover. 

Quick Fondant 

2 egg whites 2! cup f tils confectioner's 

Flavoring sugar 

Beat the whites slightly, and add the sifted sugar, a 
little at a time, until stiff enough to knead. Work in 
flavoring as desired. Then cover the hands and dredge 
the board with sugar, and form the candies in the shapes 
desired. 

Dipping Chocolates 

For dipping chocolates, purchase the regular confec- 
tioner's dipping chocolate. To five pounds of dipping 
chocolate allow one bar of cocoa butter. This will make 
the chocolate harden and will keep it from being sticky, 
or from discoloring. Cut the chocolate in small pieces, 
put it in a double boiler and let it stand over hot water 
until melted. Then cool it, beating frequently, until of 
the consistency of molasses. It is then ready for dipping. 
If desired, the chocolate may be tested with a ther- 
mometer. It should not be over 60 degrees, unless there 
is a very cool breeze to dry the candies rapidly so that the 
centers do not melt and get out of shape. A good rule to 



648 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

follow is this : The first chocolate must be entirely dry 
as the seventh is dipped. 

Triangles of fruit cake, long, unsalted oyster crackers, 
dates stuffed sparingly with peanut butter, all kinds of 
blanched nuts, Maraschino cherries, candied cranberries, 
long strips of figs, marshmallows, candied cherries, bits 
of candied pineapple, orange peel or grape fruit peel and 
many other dainties may be successfully dipped in choco- 
late. A wire twisted into the shape of a small spoon is 
a convenient utensil to use for dipping, but the hand is 
the quicker method. As the chocolate is thick, the little 
mark on top, characteristic of the commercial chocolate, 
can be made by the dipper or finger, if it is withdrawn 
quickly. Bits of candied violets, rose petals, angelica, or 
nuts form a pretty garnish. Care should be taken not 
to make the centers large, as they take up a considerable 
amount of chocolate, and the confections will then be 
liable to look clumsy. All candies should be set to dry 
on heavy paraffine paper, the thin being liable to stick. 
If possible, it is a better plan still to buy the regulation 
paper on which to dry the dipped chocolates. This is 
very highly glazed, and can be wiped off with a damp 
cloth and used over and over again. 

Chocolate Creams and Confections 

Chocolate creams and confections have as a basis a 
fondant. If chocolate creams are being made, it is best 
to make the white fondant, but for bon-bons and for the 
stuffing of fruit, an uncooked fondant gives good results. 

To make chocolate creams at home, first shape the cen- 
ters, making them a little smaller than may seem neces- 
sary. The fondant may be divided into portions, fla- 
vored and colored with vegetable coloring, according to 
fancy. Cocoanut may be worked into a vanilla-flavored 
fondant; peppermint into plain, white fondant; winter- 
green and pink coloring into white fondant; chopped 
almonds and pistachio flavoring into a portion; violet 
coloring and a drop or two of violet perfume into 
another; chopped hickory nuts or English walnuts, to- 
gether with a little vanilla flavoring, into another, while 
equal parts of peanut butter may be used with fondant to 
make still further variety. These combinations may be 



THE MAKING OF CANDIES 649 

augmented as fancy dictates. The fondant centers 
should stand a few hours before dipping in the chocolate. 

Maple Chocolate 

Combine equal parts of soft, grated maple sugar and 
fondant. Flavor with vanilla to taste, shape into small 
balls and dip in chocolate as directed. 

Chocolate Marshmallows 

Cut the marshmallows in halves and stuff each one with 
a pecan meat or a piece of preserved ginger. Press the 
pieces together and dip in chocolate as directed. 

Fenway Cocktails 

Drain Maraschino cherries thoroughly on paper towel- 
ing or cloth. Roll them in fondant. Let stiffen for sev- 
eral hours and then dip in melted chocolate, as directed. 

Chocolate Dipped Strawberries 

Select firm strawberries. Remove the stems and hulls 
but do not wash the fruit, brush it well instead. Cover 
thinly with fondant. Let sfend until firm, then dip in 
chocolate as directed. 

Chocolate Dipped Grapes 

Select fine Malaga grapes and stem them. Cover 
thinly with fondant, let stand until firm, and then dip in 
chocolate as directed. 

Christmas Loaf 

6 cupfuls sugar ii cupftils cold water 

i teaspoonful cream of tar- 
tar 

Make a fondant of the above ingredients, divide it 
when done into three parts, flavoring one with almond 
and coloring it pale green, a second with cinnamon, 
leaving it white and the third with a square (ounce) of 
melted chocolate and a little vanilla extract. Only vege- 
table colorings should be used. 

Rub an oblong pan (bread tin) with olive oil and make 
on the bottom a design of holly with leaves cut from 
angelica and red candies. Gently press the white layer 



650 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

onto this, spreading it evenly, then press on the green 
and then the chocolate layer. Let stand twenty-four 
hours to stiffen, unmould and wrap in paraffme paper. 

Cut from the loaf as desired. 



Uncooked Fudge 

7 ounces sweet chocolate 2 eggs

tract i cupful chopped almonds 

Mix together the butter, cream and extracts, then beat 
in confectioner's sugar until the mixture is stiff enough to 
form. Shape around whole almonds and roll each candy 
in the chopped nuts. The latter should be blanched and 
lightly browned in a slow oven. 

Peppermint Drops 

2 cupfuls granulated sugar i teaspoonful cream of tar- 

i cupful milk or water tar 

2 drops oil of peppermint 

Boil together all the ingredients except the flavoring, 
without stirring, until a soft ball is formed, when a little 
is tried in cold water, that is 238 F. Cool until tepid, 
add the flavoring, beat until creamy and drop on oiled 
paper from a teaspoon or small pitcher. 

Wintergreen Drops 

Follow the preceding directions, substituting winter- 
green for the peppermint and coloring the mixture pink.

Boil gently together all the ingredients except the nut 
meats (248 F.) until the mixture hardens to the con- 
sistency of a caramel when a little is tried in cold water. 
Flavor, add the nuts, then pour an inch deep into a pan 
lined with waxed paper and, when half cold, cut in 
squares. Wrap each one separately in waxed paper be- 
fore packing.

until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves. Cook to 
253 F. and simmer until the thermometer registers 254 
F. Pour onto a plate or marble slab oiled with butter 
and, when cool enough, pull. If it sticks to the hands, use 
a little flour. To flavor, work in a few drops of pepper- 
mint, wintergreen, or spearmint. 

To make this into bars, cook to 200 F. and work in a 
little peanut butter if desired and confectioner's sugar to 
stiffen, together with chopped peanuts. 

Buttercups 

Prepare pulled molasses candy, shaping to a piece a 
fourth inch thick and putting it into a well-oiled pan. Put

THE MAKING OF CANDIES 655 

Butterscotch 

I pound of butter I pint of water 

1 pound white corn syrup 3 teaspoonfuls vanilla 

2 pounds sugar 

Boil all the ingredients together, except the vanilla, 
until the mixture snaps or " rattles " against the cup 
when a little is tried in cold water, or when the candy 
thermometer reaches 300 F. Then add the vanilla, 
pour into a shallow pan, and mark in squares before it is 
quite cold. 

Pop-Corn Balls 

Make molasses taffy and omit the cocoanut or peanuts. 
Stir this into four quarts of popped corn, then shape into 
balls. 

Maple Pop-Corn 

3 quarts popped corn i cupful granulated sugar 
I cupful maple syrup 

Boil the syrup and sugar together until it spins a long 
thread (218 F.). Pour onto the corn, stir well and 
cool. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Cut the orange peel in long, fourth-inch strips, put in a 
saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to boiling 
point. Repeat this process three times, then measure the 
orange peel; add an equal quantity of sugar and hot 
water to cover, and cook until the white of the skin is 
translucent. Then drain from the syrup, roll in granu- 
lated sugar and put on plates to dry. Use the syrup in 
a gelatine or fruit cup." 

Candied Grapefruit Peel 

Cut the peel in long, narrow strips. Put on to cook in 
cold water, let boil up and drain. Repeat four times. 
Then add, by measure, as much water and sugar as peel, 
and let simmer till translucent. Then drain, roll in 
granulated sugar and let dry over night. 

Candied Cranberries 

i pint large cranberries cupful water 

if ctipfuls sugar 

Make a syrup by boiling the water and sugar together 



656 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

for five minutes, add the cranberries and let stand a few 
hours. Then cook them gently till clear, drain, put on a 
large enamel dripping pan dusted with granulated sugar, 
sprinkle a little more sugar over them and dry very 
slowly in an oven at about 120 Fahrenheit. 

Candied Kumquats 

Wash the kumquats thoroughly, then put them on in 
cold water and boil up once. Drain and repeat three 
times. To a pint of kumquats add a cupful of granu- 
lated sugar and a half cupful of honey, with hot water to 
cover. Simmer very slowly for two hours and a half, 
then drain from the syrup and dry for a few hours. 
When they are still a little sticky, roll in granulated 
sugar. They will keep indefinitely in a tightly covered 
box. 

Candied Ginger 

Scald and peel the ginger root and cut it in convenient 
pieces for eating. Boil up three times in separate 
waters, then measure and add an equal quantity of granu- 
lated sugar and as much warm water. Bring slowly to 
boiling point and simmer gently till translucent and very 
tender. Then drain, roll in granulated sugar and spread 
on cake racks or paraffine paper to dry. 

Crystallized Apricots or Pineapple 

Use canned fruit. Drain well, and cook for a few 
minutes in a heavy sugar syrup, made of I cupful of 
sugar and -J cupful of water. Then roll thickly in granu- 
lated sugar. Lay on cheesecloth "in a pan and dry for 
several hours in a very slow oven, or on the radiator. 
Sprinkle on more granulated sugar if it seems neces- 
sary. 

Christmas Joys 

i cupful figs I cupful candied cherries 

i cupful English walnut i tablespoonful lemon juice 

meats \ cupful candied orange peel 
i cupful stoned dates 

Put the fruits and nuts through the food chopper, add 
the lemon juice and knead until thoroughly mixed. Toss 
on a board well-dusted with powdered sugar, roll out to 
J inch thickness and cut into rounds with a small cutter 



THE MAKING OF CANDIES 657 

When they have stiffened, frost the tops with a plain 
orange icing, and decorate with bits of angelica and red 
cherries to simulate holly. 

Crystallized Mint Leaves and Checkerberries 
Wipe the mint leaves dry and boil for a minute in a 
syrup made of i cupful of sugar and cupful of water. 
Drain and dry over night. Then brush each leaf slightly 
with beaten egg white and dust with granulated sugar. 
Place on a cake rack covered with waxed paper and dry 
in a very slow oven, or on a radiator. Checkerberries 
may be prepared in the same way, if the preliminary boil- 
ing is increased to five minutes. 

Glace Nuts and Fruits 

2 cupfuls sugar 3 tablespoonfuls sugar 

i cupful boiling water Blanched nuts of any kind 

I teaspoonful cream of tar- 
tar 

Caramelize the three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Add 
the boiling water, and, when dissolved, the sugar and 
cream of tartar. Boil without stirring until the syrup 
is absolutely brittle when a little is dropped in cold water 
(310 F.) Remove the saucepan from the heat and 
place in a vessel of cold water to stop the boiling in- 
stantly. Then place over boiling water while dipping. 
Halves of walnuts and pecans or whole Brazil nut meats 
may be used, or peanuts or filberts may be dropped by 
the teaspoonful on a marble slab, or paraffine paper. 
The best utensil to use in dipping is a long sharp hat pin. 

Canned pineapple, cherries and apricots, bits of figs, 
dates stuffed with fondant, Malaga grapes, strawberries 
and sections of seedless oranges may be dipped. In case 
juicy fruits are used, they must not be pricked while 
dipping as the juice will spoil the glace. 

Old-Fashioned Jelly Wafers 

i cupfuls cooked sifted, 3 tablespoonfuls granulated 

dried apricots, apple pulp, gelatine soaked in i cupful 

prunes or plums cold water 

2\ cupfuls sugar Flavoring 

cupful water 

Boil the sugar and water together for five minutes, 



658 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

then add the fruit pulp and simmer until thick like 
marmalade. Add the soaked gelatine a little at a time 
until all is in, and let it boil up thoroughly all over. It 
will then leave the spoon in long strings. Cool the mix- 
ture and flavor. If apple pulp is used, half may be 
flavored with a half-cupful of minced mint leaves, or one 
teaspoon ful of peppermint essence and colored pale 
green; the second half with rose and colored pink. In 
case apricots are used, flavor with lemon extract, while 
prunes need orange. Plums may have a little orange or 
lemon extract added to them. 

Drop the mixture from a narrow spoon onto waxed 
paper in small rounds and let set over night. When 
quite stiff, press together in pairs, spread on waxed paper 
and let dry in a current of air for two hours. Then roll 
in granulated sugar and dry again. Dp not use for two 
days. 

To Salt Peanuts and Almonds 

Use only raw peanuts. To blanch either peanuts or 
almonds, cover with cold water, bring to boiling point, 
let stand for a minute or two, drain and husk at once. 
Not more than half a pound should be blanched at a 
time. Dry for several hours on paper toweling. Heat 
olive oil, or any of the pure vegetable cooking fats, to the 
point where it will brown a bit of bread in forty counts. 
Cover the bottom of a frying basket with nuts, immerse 
them in the fat and remove them before they are quite 
brown enough ; their own heat will finish the coloring. 
Spread on brown paper or paper toweling and dredge 
lightly with very fine table salt. 

Salted Pecans 

Blanch the nuts as perfectly as possible with boiling 
water, then drain and dry. Rub, or mix lightly, with 
slightly beaten egg white, then toss in a small amount 
of salt ; spread on paraffine paper and set in a very slow 
oven to dry out. 

Roast Salted Walnuts 

Rinse and dry the walnut meats, if bought loose. 
Thickly butter a dripping pan, put in a generous layer

of the nuts and roast slowly till golden and crisp, stirring 
occasionally. Then dust lightly with salt. 

Stuffed Figs 

Select moist pulled figs, remove the stem ends, split 
open lengthwise and fill each with half a marshmallow, 
pressing in a raisin as a finish, or with a mixture of 
chopped nuts and raisins and prunes, with orange 
flavored fondant, or chopped orange peel. 

Stuffed Raisin Clusters 

Select fine cluster raisins, split each raisin with a sharp 
knife and insert a bit of candied cherry or a half 
blanched almond in each. In finishing a box of candy 
with such a cluster, leaves cut from angelica will add a 
lively note. 

Stuffed Dates 

Remove the stones from the dates and fill with orange- 
flavored fondant, English walnuts, almonds, or pecan 
nuts, the mixture for Canoe Club Almonds, or peanut 
butter. In case the latter is used, roll the dates in finely 
chopped peanuts; otherwise in granulated sugar. 

Stuffed Prunes 

Select large prunes, scrub well and let soak for two 
hours. Remove the stones, drain the prunes well and 
fill the centers with fondant and nuts, or fondant and 
preserved ginger. Roll in granulated sugar and let stand 
over night to ripen. 

Cocoanut Kisses 

\ pound shredded cocoanut 2 cupfuls powdered sugar 

i egg white 

Beat the egg white stiff, and add the sugar and cocoa- 
nut gradually. Form into balls and bake on a buttered 
cookie sheet in a slow oven. 

Mint Turkish Paste 

3 tablespoonfuls granulated I cupful cold water 

gelatine i tablespoonful lemon juice 

^ cupful orange juice f cupful candied cherries, 

1 cupful minced fresh mint minced 

6 drops essence peppermint Green coloring 

2 cupfuls sugar 



66o MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Let the gelatine stand in the fruit juices until the liquid 
has been absorbed. Stir together the sugar, water and 
mint, set over a slow heat until the sugar is dissolved, 
then add the gelatine and boil for twenty minutes. Color, 
and, when almost cool, stir in the cherries and turn into 
an unoiled bread pan. Let stiffen over night, then sift 
confectioner's sugar thickly over the paste, loosen at the 
edges with a sharp knife, and pull onto a board dredged 
with confectioner's sugar. Cut in cubes and roll each 
in sugar. 



CHAPTER XXVII 
CHEESE 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

As generally used, cheese is neither an inexpensive nor 
an especially healthful food. Tagging along as the final 
course at dinner, it is usually a superfluous expense and 
a frequent cause of indigestion. 

While it does contain certain bacteria that have the 
power of stimulating the digestive juices, the artificial 
effort ceases before the cheese itself can be acted upon 
the consequent digestive torpor resulting in flatulence 
and, often, severe pain. This is why cheese, when served 
with pie, frequently incites a feeling of heaviness in the 
stomach that is credited to some other cause. 

Of all the foods grouped under the term " meats and 
meat substitutes," or proteins, cheese is the most compact 
and concentrated. It contains no cellulose, no connec- 
tive tissue and no bone to separate the particles of 
nourishment, and unless it is combined with, or accom- 
panied by, some coarse grain or vegetable, it is very in- 
digestible, because the individual in the effort to obtain 
enough bulk to overcome hunger is liable to overeat. 

This same concentration, however, makes cheese an 
economical food, because it contains absolutely no waste, 
and when it is remembered, for instance, that one pound 
of ordinary cheese contains approximately all the casein 
(protein) and fat in a gallon of milk, its nutritive value 
is indisputable. Authorities differ concerning the food 
value of cheese in comparison with that of meat, but 
recent reports show that two-thirds of a pound of Amer- 
ican cheese is equivalent to a pound of beef ; and as a 
part of the beef is waste, and as shrinkage in meat 
cookery must be allowed, it is easily deduced that cheese 
is an economical as well as a nourishing food. 

This, however, does not apply to all kinds of cheeses, 

661 



662 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

for their nutritive value depends partly upon the method 
of manufacture. A skimmed milk cheese, as Parmesan, 
for instance, contains only a trace of fat, and cottage 
cheese made from separated milk is also deficient in fat 
unless cream, or melted butter, is added to make the 
dietetic balance. Stilton cheese which, according to 
Hutchinson, contains about the same percentage of nu- 
triment as the American variety, costs twice as much per 
pound, while Roquefort, Camembert, or Gorgonzola, are 
expensive and contain less nourishment than the cheaper 
varieties. For this reason, it is advisable to purchase 
cheese according to the purpose for which it is to be used, 
remembering that a low or moderate-priced cheese con- 
tains as much nourishment as the more costly varieties, 
which are valued for flavor ; and that a bland cheese, 
with no pronounced flavor, is far more adaptable to 
cookery than a " sharp " cheese. 

The reason that cheese is not generally used as a sub- 
stantial food is undoubtedly due to lack of knowledge. 
A visit to any large market or up-to-date grocery store 
will disclose a number of varieties, and, unless the house- 
wife is clever enough to learn their uses from her for- 
eign neighbor, she is very liable to pass by one of the 
most adequate food supplies. " Full cream," " Ameri- 
can " and " American dairy " cheese are one and the 
same article and may be used in all cases where general 
cheese cookery is to be adopted. Cheddar may be used 
in the same way. Sage cheese is not suited to cookery 
and can be served plain only, or in a rarebit ; " Sap Sago," 
" Romano " and " Parmesan " cheese are all of Italian 
make and are especially desirable for use with macaroni, 
or soups, or whenever a hard, grated cheese is to appear. 
Parmesan may be obtained in bottles, grated ready for 
use, although it must be utilized within two or three weeks 
after opening or it may become mouldy. Edam and 
pineapple cheese should be served as salad accompani- 
ments, cream and cottage cheese with bread and butter 
or crackers, Swiss cheese with brown or rye bread and 
butter either in sandwiches with a dash of mustard or 
plain, Stilton as a conventional course at dinner, Lim- 
burger with frankfurters and sauerkraut, while Gorgon- 



CHEESE 663 

zola and Camembert are suitable for the after-dinner 
savory. 

Cooked cheese is far more wholesome than the raw, if 
prepared at a moderate heat, but no food can be more 
indigestible than cheese subjected to a high heat. Con- 
sisting mostly of casein, which, by the wa^, is similar 
to the albumin in eggs, it becomes as tough and leathery 
as an overcooked egg when prepared too rapidly. For 
this reason all vegetables or cereals should be thoroughly 
cooked before the cheese is added to them. If an Eng- 
lish cheese pudding is to be baked, for example, the dish 
should be set in hot water and tjpe temperature of the 
water should not be allowed to get above the simmering 
point. When a rarebit or an English Monkey is to be 
prepared, it should stand over hot water during the whole 
process; if cheese is to be added to soup, it should be 
after the boiling is completed. 

Although it may replace the usual meat at any meal 
during the day, it is more satisfactory to use cheese at 
luncheon or supper, as the strong flavor is not well 
adapted to breakfast, and custom has formed the meat 
habit at dinner. It is at first a little difficult for the in- 
experienced housewife to build up her menus with cheese 
as the central dish, but, if she keeps constantly in mind 
the dietetic balance, the task is greatly simplified. As 
cheese is so concentrated, a certain amount of bulky food 
must be added to the meal to provide ballast enough to 
satisfy hunger and help on the intestinal action. This is 
usually obtained through the use of grains or cereals, or 
vegetables. Because cheese is heavy in texture, it often 
engenders a feeling of satiety before sufficient food has 
been eaten, unless " cut " with a contrasting acid or fresh 
flavor. So whenever it is introduced, a green salad or a 
tart fruit in some form should make up a portion of the 
menu. Brown, rye, or whole wheat meal bread is a per- 
fect combination with cheese, not only in the old nursery 
tales, but to-day, when the whole economic world is 
searching for the best in foods, and it supplies not only 
the necessary bulk, but the correct amount of food con- 
stituents as well. 

In planning meals in which cheese is the main dish, 



664 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

it will inevitably occur to the housewife that she is allow- 
ing too little. A fair trial, however, 'will convince her 
that a cheese meal is sufficiently substantial to satisfy 
men in any walk of life ; this is true because it is im- 
possible to eat of cheese as of meat, because it is so 
compact. The following menus which are suitable for 
luncheon or supper show how cheese combinations may 
be made : 

I 
English Cheese Pudding Brown Bread and Butter 

Lettuce and Tomato Salad 
Fried Cornmeal Mush Maple Syrup 

Tea 



Brown Rice Croquettes Cheese Sauce 

Bread and Butter Buttered String Beans 

Baked Apple Dumplings Lemon Sauce 

Tea 

3 
Potato Stew 1 with Cheese Buttered Toast 

Egg Salad 

Grape Juice Gelatine with Light Cream Cake 

Tea 

4 

Tomato Soup Crisp Crackers 

Brown Bread and Butter Sliced Swiss Cheese 

Celery 
Apple Turnovers Tea 

All of these menus are roughly balanced and have been 
thoroughly tested the only difference between that 
served to a man at light work and the one at hard labor 
being in the amount. A little study will show that these 
are frugal meals, inexpensive and easy of preparation. 
In the first menu, the salad supplies the freshening touch, 
the brown bread and butter the bulk and protein neces- 
sary to complete the main dish (in this case not over- 
rich in cheese as it is really a bread and cheese pudding), 
while the cornmeal provides extra starch, and the syrup 
the sweet. In the second menu the cheese is combined 
with rice croquettes as a sauce. The string beans add 
the bulk and the apple dumplings with lemon sauce the 
enlivening touch. In the third menu the cheese is used 




CHEESE AND NUT BALLS 




MACAROON BISQUE 



CHEESE 665 

in a very different way, being an adjunct to the soup, 
rather than the chief constituent in the dish. The stew 
is, therefore, valuable as a starchy food, the egg salad 
providing the protein, and the tart grape juice gelatine, 
the acid touch. In the fourth menu uncooked cheese 
takes its proper place and is used to supplement an other- 
wise deficient meal. The soup provides the mineral and 
liquid, brown bread and butter supplemented by thinly- 
sliced Swiss cheese the protein, celery the awakening 
touch and the apple turnovers the needed starch. 

To keep cheese from the time it is received until all 
is used is a problem. In order to forestall mould or 
dryness, it should be wrapped in a slightly-damp cloth, 
then in paper and kept in a cool place. When conven- 
ient, waxed paper may replace the cloth. In no case 
should air be wholly excluded as then mould is liable to 
form. Scraps of cheese, like odds and ends of bread, 
should be kept separate from the main supply as the 
little pieces afford greater opportunity for the growth of 
bacteria. 

When cheese is to be cooked, the majority of recipes 
give directions for grating. This, at best, is a slow 
process and not at all necessary unless cheese straws or 
cheese crackers are to be made. If it must be done, the 
most convenient grater for the purpose contains little 
slits which act like knives and, by using it, the cheese 
can be prepared without grating the fingers. Whenever 
cheese is to be put into a savory, or sauce of any kind, 
the simplest method is to put it through the food chop- 
per ; while, if it is to be melted before adding the other 
ingredients (as in some methods for making Welsh 
rarebit), slicing is sufficient. 

Combinations of cheese and eggs are innumerable. 
In baking eggs in milk, bestrew with grated cheese; to 
make a cheese omelet, spread grated cheese thickly in 
the fold and serve with tomato sauce; while eggs 
scrambled with cheese is a delicious southern dish. 
Hard-cooked eggs may be sliced and heated in a cheese 
sauce, or the sauce may be poured over toast and 
sprinkled with finely-chopped egg. 

The old Romans made wonderful salads of cheese, 
lettuce, raisins and honey, with a dash of olive oil, and 



666 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

while such a combination is not tempting to us, we ap- 
proach it in the service of cheese with salads. Lettuce 
can be made into a hearty supper dish, if dressed with a 
French dressing and sprinkled with cottage cheese, put 
through a potato ricer, and accompanied with brown 
bread and butter and rich preserves. If cottage cheese 
is not at hand, any soft American cheese will answer the 
purpose, if grated or chopped fine. 

The Service of Cheese 

Cheese may appear in many ways, but should not be 
repeated in the same menu. For example, if cheese 
balls, or cheese crackers, are served with the salad, 
cheese should not be served again at the end of the meal. 
A well-planned menu never repeats flavors. Occasion- 
ally a- cheese souffle opens or closes a meal as a hot savory 
hors d'ccuvre. But this should not be done unless the 
balance of the meal is comparatively light. Cheese is 
often also served as a salad accompaniment, but most 
often it appears at the close of the meal. 

As cheeses are so different in character, care should 
be taken to choose a suitable type. 

Plain cheese is usually cut in cubes and served on a 
doily-covered plate, and may be accompanied with 
crackers; saltines are particularly acceptable. A fork 
is used for the service. The tops of Edam, or pine- 
apple, cheese are sawed or cut off to form lids, a silver 
knob being inserted for a handle, if convenient. To 
protect the fingers, the cheese should be wrapped in a 
folded paper napkin, and may be placed on a fancy 
plate, surrounded with crisp crackers and garnished with 
parsley. The cheese should be loosened before passing. 
A cheese scoop is always used to remove it. Roquefort 
and Camembert are usually cut in pie-shaped pieces and 
the whole cheese (small) may be cut to set in the stand- 
ard of a cheese dish, the plate below holding the crackers. 
A broad cheese -knife is used for the service. Sweet 
Swiss cheese may be sliced and served on a doily-covered 
plate, although it is most appropriately served on grape 
leaves ; the accompaniment should be rye crackers. 

Cream, or Neufchatel, cheese is placed either whole 
or sliced on a handled cheese plate with a broad cheese 



CHEESE 667 

knife for the service. If the cheese course ends the 
meal, which is often concluded Continental fashion, with 
the salad, a jar of Bar le Due jelly, or strawberry pre- 
serve, is often passed with it. In case a more elaborate 
service is desired, the high standard of the cheese dish 
may be filled with stuffed prunes and cheese balls covered 
with whipped cream may be disposed about the base; 
unsweetened crackers should be passed. 



Prunes and Cheese Balls 

Soak the prunes for two hours in tepid water. Drain 
well, remove the stones, replace with walnut meats and 
roll them in granulated sugar. To prepare the balls, mix 
a little salt, sweet cream and lemon juice with the cheese, 
chill and shape into balls the size of a walnut. Slightly 
sweeten heavy cream, add a little lemon juice and beat 
stiff. Roll the balls in this and sprinkle with chopped 
nuts before serving. 

Pastry sticks, pulled bread, or devilled biscuits are 
often used with cheese instead of crackers, while, if 
celery or olives are not served elsewhere during the meal, 
they may appear with this course. 

Again, cheese sticks, or crackers, spread with a little 
paste of cream cheese and pimentoes are sometimes 
passed with the coffee while a jar of home-made club 
cheese set in a holder and accompanied by a spoon is 
often passed with whole wheat crackers.

CHAPTER XXVIII 
INVALID COOKERY AND SERVICE 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

Few housewives understand the preparation of the 
simplest dishes in the invalid's dietary although in the 
majority of cases of illness the nursing is done by mem- 
bers of the household. And diet plays a most important 
part in restoring just as it does in maintaining health. 
Many a patient drifts into a critical stage because he is 
not supplied with the proper foods. Even when only 
suffering with a severe cold the diet should be lightened, 
as a hearty meal is liable to overtax the digestive organs 
to the point where they fail to do their work. The un- 
digested food remains in the digestive canal and fer- 
ments, the poisons which are generated lower the vitality, 
and the patient's condition becomes worse. Much trouble 
arises because the home nurse does not know what to 
feed and how to prepare it, while other patients are 
almost starved to death because of the ridiculous notion 
that food must be almost always withheld during illness. 
It is just as radical a mistake to starve a sick person as 
to overfeed him, for, even while confined to bed, he still 
requires a certain amount of food to carry on the busi- 
ness of living. There are, to be sure, certain illnesses in 
which food should be withheld, but in that case the 
patient is extremely sick, and requires the constant serv- 
ice of a physician, who will prescribe the diet. 

In hospitals ordinary diets are grouped under the fol- 
lowing heads : 

1. Liquid Diet. 

2. Light Diet. 

3. Convalescent Diet. 

All the special diets, as diabetic and diet in pneumonia, 
are dictated by the physician for each individual case. 

674 



INVALID COOKERY AND SERVICE 675 

Under liquid diet are included broths, clear soups, 
albumin water, milk, Koumiss, cocoa, egg-nogs and 
gruels of all kinds. Grape juice, orange juice and 
lemonade may be added. 

Light diet includes poached, boiled or coddled eggs, 
toast, toasted crackers, milk soups, well-cooked cereals, 
rice, milk toast, cocoa with egg, junket, custards, fruit 
and wine jellies, sifted apple sauce and all the foods 
enumerated under liquid diet. 

In convalescent diet the invalid begins to approach his 
normal food. Broiled chicken, squab, chops or steak, 
scraped-beef balls (it will be noted that the meats are 
broiled, not fried), well-baked potatoes, scrambled eggs 
or omelet, well-cooked spinach, peas or stewed celery, 
sponge cake a day old, baked apples, stewed figs or 
prunes, oranges, Malaga grapes, rice or tapioca pudding, 
and bread a day old may be added to the list for light 
diet. 

As a general rule it may be stated that liquid diet is 
used in fever cases, in severe gastric disorders (stomach 
diseases) ; for two days after delivery in maternity cases, 
in pneumonia, mumps and cases of severe intestinal in- 
digestion. In fever, liver and pneumonia cases the acid 
drinks mentioned in the list are often added. 

Light diet is the first step up from the liquid diet to 
solid food and may also be used for a day or so when 
the stomach is upset, in cases of rheumatism, grippe, for 
a few days in maternity cases, and in the diseases of 
children, like the second stage of measles, chicken pox 
or scarlet fever. It is- also used in fever cases for three 
or four days after the temperature has dropped to a 
normal state. 

Convalescent diet is usually resumed when the patient 
begins to be dressed, or, at least, is sitting up for a few 
hours each day; it is generally commenced by the addi- 
tion of one extra dish to light diet, the variety and quan- 
tity being gradually increased until the patient is eating 
the usual family food. When this occurs, he will be well. 

Any invalid should be fed frequently and in small quan- 
tities, in order to avoid overtaxing the digestive organs, 
and yet furnish the necessary nourishment. In acute dis- 
eases, for instance, the patient is often fed every two 



676 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

hours in very small quantities. In such cases the amount 
of liquid is generally prescribed in ounces. In measuring 
such amounts a graduated glass, with the ounces and 
drachms clearly marked upon it, will be of incalculable 
assistance. In case such a glass is not at hand, the num- 
ber of ounces may be measured by a standard teaspoon ; 
two tablespoons, or six teaspoons, constituting the ounce. 
If a silver knife or teaspoon is put into the glass, hot 
liquids may be poured into it without fear of breakage. 
The administering of liquid diet to a very sick patient 
from a teaspoon is usually a disagreeable task taxing 
the patience of the home nurse to the utmost, and wetting 
the face and neck of the patient. A glass feeding tube 
may be purchased at any druggist's, and, as it is made 
with a bend, this may be placed between the patient's lips, 
the nurse may hold the cup of liquid, and the patient 
drink without being raised from the bed, or feeling the 
liquid trickle down his neck! In cases where the patient 
is too exhaused to even draw the liquid through the tube, 
a feeding cup may be used. In using this, slip the mouth 
of the cup between the patient's lips, and pour in the 
liquid so gradually that there may be no possibility of 
choking. 

At no time is a person so sensitive to imperfection as 
during sickness. This is because his world is bounded 
by the four walls of the room, interest is self-centered, 
and, unless all foods approach perfection, the patient as- 
sumes the lack to be a personal affront. In serving hot 
milk or cocoa, be sure that the scum is removed, or it 
may " turn the stomach " and produce nausea. Lemon- 
ade, orangeade and egg-nogs should be strained, 'and all 
lumps carefully removed from gruels. For this purpose 
a china strainer will be invaluable. It should be large 
enough to fit over either a glass or cup ; as it is of china 
rather than wire like the ordinary strainer, and is used 
only for the invalid, it may be kept surgically clean. 

The nurse frequently reports to the physicians that the 
patient has no appetite. In many cases this may be due 
to the depressing effect of an ill-kept room, or to " a bad 
taste in the mouth," which may be removed by a mouth 
wash of water containing boracic acid (a fourth of a tea- 
spoonful to a cupful of lukewarm water) or to the gen- 



INVALID COOKERY AND SERVICE 677 

eral condition of the patient. Whatever the cause it 
must be ascertained and removed. Frequently more time 
and thought expended upon the invalid's meals will 
remedy this condition. Punctuality in serving the meals 
must be strictly observed, for appetite is largely a result 
of habit ; a meal delayed often appears after all desire for 
food has gone. 

The principal meal of the day should be given when the 
patient is sitting up. In case the meal is served in bed 
the pillows must be carefully arranged as a support, and 
if a bed tray with little standard legs is not in the house- 
hold, a pillow, smoothed flat, and placed upon the 
patient's lap, will act as a resting place for the tray. 

When a patient is very ill, the nurse is liable to become 
careless, and instead of choosing the prettiest cup in the 
house for broth, and setting it in its saucer on a doily- 
covered tray, she will bring it in a cracked kitchen cup, 
walking very slowly in order not to spill the contents ! 
Either the cup or the way it is presented may be sufficient 
to upset a nervous patient, and while it sometimes seems 
as though the invalid does not notice any little defects, it 
is often only too true that he is too ill to speak of them 
and that they jar horribly upon his taut nerves. 

The tray should be covered with a clean tray-cloth or 
napkin, the silver placed upon it in the most convenient 
position for use, and all hot dishes should be covered. It 
is always a great pleasure to an invalid to begin to do 
things for himself, and an individual pot for hot milk or 
cocoa, necessitating a little effort in pouring it out, will 
often be the first step toward reasserting the self-respect 
that is so much a part of health. In so far as possible 
individual dishes should be used in preparing the in- 
valid's food, as it conveys the idea that he is the subject 
of special thought. In any home of moderate means 
there is no necessity for serving mismatched and cracked 
dishes to the invalid. There is an old French proverb 
which says that " The eye does half the eating/' and it is 
more true in sickness than under any other circumstances. 

When the diet becomes convalescent, the patient can 
usually eat one or two meals of the day at a serving table. 
By this time the tray is liable to become overcrowded if 
all the food is brought in at once, so it is a good plan to 



678 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

reserve the sweet until the main portion of the meal has 
been eaten. It then acts as a surprise. 

Generally a patient should not be consulted as to what 
he " wants to eat." If he expresses a desire, gratify it, 
if it is not unreasonable, and in some cases even then. 
Never serve a food that is difficult to eat (unless during 
convalescence), like broiled chicken, without either break- 
ing it up before bringing it to the patient, or else prepar- 
ing it for him after bringing in the tray, otherwise he will 
become discouraged and refuse to eat it. Stay with him 
while eating, or else delegate some other member of the 
family to do so, as otherwise he will eat too fast, and 
indigestion will result. 

Probably the most neglected country diet is that served 
in maternity cases. The energy of the new mother is at a 
low ebb, for months her strength has been given to the 
new life, and. after birth, in normal cases, the drain is 
continued through the production of milk. For the first 
six hours after labor a milk diet should be given, light 
diet should be served for the next three days, five meals a 
day being needed to keep up strength. Convalescent diet 
may be used for a few succeeding days, when the usual 
daily fare may be resumed, with the exception of 
strongly-flavored vegetables, like onions, or cabbage, or 
fruits which are acid, like strawberries. Beer should 
never be taken, as it has no action upon the flow of milk, 
as is popularly believed. 

The following recipes will prove of assistance in pre- 
paring sick diets. 

GENERAL RULE FOR GRUELS 

The cereal, when possible, should be cooked in a double 
boiler for four hours until it becomes a jelly. In using, 
thin a little of the jellied cereal, with milk or cream, re- 
heat, season and strain. 

Barley Gruel 

2 tablespoonfuls pearl barley i teaspoonful salt 

i quart boiling water 

Add the barley to the water, and boil for two hours, or 
until it is reduced one-half. Strain, rubbing through a 



INVALID COOKERY AND SERVICE 679 

fine sieve, sweeten, if desired, and serve hot. A little 
warm milk or cream may be added, if permissible. 

Oatmeal Gruel 

1 cupful coarse oatmeal or i pint boiling water 
rolled oats i teaspoonful salt 

Add the oatmeal to the boiling water, stirring con- 
stantly. Cook over the heat for ten minutes, and then for 
three hours in a double boiler. Rub through a sieve, and 
thin with milk, cream or water as desired. Re-heat and 
serve. If allowed, J cupful raisins, or \ cupful of cut-up 
apple, may be cooked in this gruel, adding flavor. 

Flour Gruel or Thickened Milk 

2 tablespoonfuls flour 4 tablespoonfuls cold milk 
i teaspoonful salt 3 cupfuls milk, scalded 

Scald the milk. Mix the flour thoroughly with the cold 
milk and add it to the hot milk. Cook half an hour in a 
double boiler, stirring occasionally. Strain and serve hot. 
This is often used for diarrhea, though it is not so good 
as a water gruel for extreme cases. 

Cornmeal Gruel 

i tablespoonful home-ground i cupful cold water 
cornmeal i teaspoonful salt 

1 pint boiling water 

Stir the cornmeal mixed in the cold water into the 
boiling water. Simmer or cook in a double boiler for an 
hour or longer. Strain and serve. Sugar and milk may 
be added, if desired, or it may be made wholly of milk, 
cooking entirely in a double boiler. 

Beef Broth 

2 pounds round of beef i cupful cold water 
i teaspoonful salt 

Wipe the meat, remove the skin and fat and cut the 
meat into small pieces. Put in a kettle with the bones, if 
there are any, add the cold water, and let it stand for half 
an hour to extract the juices. Heat gradually to boiling 
point, season with salt and pepper, and simmer two hours, 
or until the meat is tender. Do not allow it to boil. Re- 



680 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

move the fat and strain the broth. Re-heat in a double 
boiler and serve hot. 

Beef Tea 

i pound fresh beef from i cupful cold water 

neck Salt 

Wipe the meat, remove all fat and cut the meat in small 
pieces. Add the cold water and let stand fifteen minutes. 
Put in a canning jar, cover it loosely, place it on a trivet 
in a kettle and surround with cold water. Allow the 
water to heat slowly. Do not let it get above simmering 
point. Cook two hours. Strain and serve. 

Beef tea may be frozen to the consistency of a water 
ice and is excellent in fever cases. 

Egg Broth 

3 cupfuls hot beef broth J teaspoonful salt 

i egg 

Beat the white and yolk of the egg separately. Add 
the hot broth, gradually, to the yolk, stirring continually. 
Add the salt and fold into the white. Re-heat over hot 
water and serve very hot. 

Clam Bouillon 

Wash and scrub with a brush one quart of clams, 
changing the water several times. Put in a kettle with 
I cupful cold water, cover tightly and steam until the 
shells are well-opened. Strain the liquor before serving. 

Oyster Stew 

I cupful milk Salt and pepper 

6 oysters i cupful hot water 

i teaspoonful butter 

Wash the oysters, discard the liquor and steam over 
hot water until the edges are curled. Scald the milk, add 
it to the butter, pour in the steamed oysters and liquor, 
season, and serve with hot toasted crackers.

li tablespoon fuls brown rice i stalk celery or 

i cupful milk I teaspoonful celery seed 

I tablespoonful butter i bay leaf 

i teaspoonful onion juice Salt and pepper .to taste 



INVALID COOKERY AND SERVICE 681 

Scald the milk. Add the rice and cook in a double 
boiler thirty minutes. Melt the butter, add the onion 
juice, bay leaf and celery stalk cut in bits, and saute 
slightly. Add to the soup, season and strain through a 
sieve. If too thick, thin with more milk. Chicken broth 
may be used in place of the milk. In this case add one 
tablespoonful of cream before serving. 

Chicken Broth 

Clean a two- or three-pound chicken and wash thor- 
oughly. Separate at the joints, cover with two and a half 
quarts of cold water, bring slowly to boiling point, a"nd 
simmer until the meat is very tender. At the end of three 
hours strain, season the broth, and let stand over night in 
a cold place to let the fat come to the top. Remove the 
fat and re-heat the broth; well-boiled brown or uncoated 
rice may be added, if desired. 

Whey 

i cupful milk i teaspoonful cold water 

i junket tablet 

Heat the milk until tepid and add the tablet dissolved in 
the cold water. Let it set, then break up the curd and 
strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth, being care- 
ful to remove all the solid portion. Serve cold with or 
without sweetening, and flavor as desired. 

Peptonized or Partially Digested Milk 
Into a clean quart jar put the contents of one pepton- 
izing tube and i cupful of cold water. Shake well, add a 
pint of fresh cold milk and?shake again. Place the bottle 
in water at about 115 degrees F., and keep there five to 
ten minutes, then place bottle on ice at once to check 
further digestion. 

Barley Water 

I cupful pearl barley & teaspoonful salt 

i pint boiling water Sugar to taste 

3 pints boiling water 

Wash the barley thoroughly, add the pint of boiling 
water and simmer five minutes. Pour off this liquid and 
add the salt and the three pints of freshly boiling water. 



682 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Simmer for two hours. Strain, and add sugar, if desired. 
Cool and serve. In cases of constipation add J pound 
figs, cut fine, with the second water. Prunes or raisins 
can also be used. The juice of half a lemon is also a 
good addition after the drink has cooled. 

Lemonade 

i lemon I tablespoonful sugar (ap- 

i cupful boiling water proximate) 

\ thin slice lemon 

Cut a thin slice from the center of the lemon. Squeeze 
the 'lemon juice into a glass (keeping back seeds). Com- 
bine the sugar and boiling water and place on ice to chill. 
Add the lemon juice, and use the lemon slice as a gar- 
nish. More sugar will be needed if the fruit 'is very 
acid. 

Orangeade 

i sour orange i tablespoonful sugar (ap- 

i cupful boiling water proximate) 

i slice orange 

Prepare as for lemonade. If the orange is not suffi- 
ciently sour, add lemon juice. Either orangeade or 
lemonade may be acceptably frozen to an ice, if additional 
sugar is added. 

Oatmeal Lemonade 

ij tablespoonfuls fine oat- Juice i4 lemons 

meal Sugar to taste 

Few grains salt 3 pints boiling water 

Mix the oatmeal and salt with the cold water. Add to 
the boiling water and cook until reduced to a quart.

center, put in the butter and drop in the egg yolk. Cook 
in a moderate oven from six to eight minutes. 



684 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Scraped-Beef-Balls 

i pound round steak i toast round 

Wipe the steak with a damp cloth. Scrape up the meat 
fiber by means of a broad-bladed case knife. Form this 
pulp into little balls and lightly broil in a heated frying 
pan, rolling them about until slightly browned. Salt, and 
serve on the toast, buttered. 

Chops or Birds Broiled in Paper 

Wipe chops or birds, and dust them with salt and pep- 
per. Spread a piece of thick letter paper, evenly and 
thickly, with butter. Lay on it the meat and fold the 
paper so that no juices can escape. Broil carefully, tak- 
ing care that the paper does not ignite. 

A chop broiled in this way will cook in five minutes 
when three-quarters of an inch thick and in eight minutes 
when one inch thick. Squab or chicken must cook thirty 
minutes. 

Potatoes on the Half Shell 

Cut off the tops of baked potatoes and scoop out the 
inside. Mash and season well and add a well-beaten egg 
white. Fill the skins with this mixture, heaping it lightly 
on top. Place in the oven and brown slightly.

Add the water to the caramelized sugar and cook to a 
thick syrup. Add the syrup, sugar, salt, and vanilla to 
the milk and cool to blood heat. Dissolve the junket 
tablet in cold water, add to the tepid mixture, and pour at 
once into serving dishes. Serve with whipped cream. 



Baked Custard (Two Small Custards) 

i cupful scalded milk Few grains salt 

1 egg teaspoonful flavoring 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar 



Scald the milk. Mix together the other ingredients. 
Pour into these the scalded milk. Transfer to custard 
cups, set in a pan of hot water and bake until set in a 
moderate oven. Test with a knife. If, after inserting, 
the knife is perfectly clean, the custard is done. Remove

CHAPTER XXIX 
CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 

ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL 

The extent to which it pays to can fruits and vegetables 
depends entirely upon whether or not they are home 
grown, or whether they must be purchased. As a general 
rule it costs almost, 'or quite as much, for the materials 
used in preparing home-canned fruits and vegetables as 
it does to buy commercial canned goods of high quality, 
and when the time and energy involved are considered, 
it would seem to be a mistake to spend the entire summer 
working in a hot kitchen when no economy is effected. 

But if one lives on a farm, or has a large garden, can- 
ning becomes an economic necessity. However, the old 
days of the open-kettle method with its doubtful results 
are gone, and the intermittent, or three-days'-canning 
method has also become a part of culinary history, the 
wise woman, choosing, rather, the new cold-pack method 
which insures fine, firm, colorful results, and products 
that will keep, all with a minimum expenditure of time 
and energy. 

The outfit needed in carrying on the new method of 
canning is as follows : A good wash boiler fitted with a 
wire rack made to contain from six to ten jars, according 
to the size of the boiler, and equipped with handles so 
that the jar-filled rack may be removed without burning 
the hands. This device is a real time-saver, as it obviates 
all necessity of handling each jar separately. The jars 
should be of glass, of any good make, preferably of the 
type with a cover that clamps on, although screw-top jars 
may be used. The rubbers must be new and of the very 
best quality ; there should be a steamer, or an improvised 
one, consisting of a wide-topped kettle over which a 
steamer top may be fitted to use in steaming greens and 
other bulky vegetables before putting them into the can- 
ning jars. 



688 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Commercial canning outfits may be purchased if de- 
sired. The hot-water-bath outfit is especially made for 
out-door work and is equipped with a fire-box with smoke 
pipe, sterilizing bath, lifting trays, etc., is quickly set up 
and light enough so that it may be easily transported from 
place to place. If a very large amount of canning is to 
be done, this outfit will more than pay for itself in the long 
run, but the results are no better than those obtained by 
means of the wash-boiler equipment already described. 
A second type of commercial canner is used, as a water- 
seal outfit in which a higher temperature may be obtained 
than in the hot-water-bath outfit described, and is par- 
ticularly good in the canning of meats or certain vege- 
tables which are difficult to keep. Then there are the 
steam-pressure outfits which are very practical and may 
be used in the household as general utensils. The first 
cost is a little high, but, again, if one lives on a farm, or 
has a productive garden, the cooker will pay for itself in 
short order if the vegetables or fruits are faithfully 
canned. 

Several new terms have come into being along with the 
new cold-pack method. The following list with its defini- 
tions is self-explanatory: 

1. Cold-pack. This means the packing of uncooked or 
blanched foods together with some liquid, as syrup, water, 
soup stock, or vegetable juice into clean jars, covering 
and then sterilizing (cooking) them with their contents 
by means of boiling water or steam. 

2. Scalding. The dipping of a vegetable or fruit into 
boiling water to loosen the skin, so that it can be removed 
with the least possible loss of pulp. To remove undesir- 
able acids. To start the flow of the coloring matter, 
which must be arrested immediately by the cold dip. 

3. Cold Dip. This means the dipping of the scalded 
fruits or vegetables immediately into cold water for two 
or three minutes to arrest further cooking and therefore 
to harden the heated pulp. This coagulates the color- 
ing matter so that there will be less loss of color during 
the sterilization period and at the same time the prod- 
ucts may be handled to better advantage during the pack- 
ing. 

4. Blanching. This means to boil, or steam, the prod- 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 689 

uct to be canned for a brief time before packing into the 
cans. Unless it is necessary to remove a strong flavor, as 
that of cabbage or dandelions, it is far better to blanch the 
products by means of steam as there is then no loss of 
food value. This process is necessary to remove objec- 
tionable acids and bitter flavors, and to reduce the bulk of 
vegetables, like spinach, and to obviate all necessity for 
the use of the old-time intermittent process by which it 
was necessary to boil the fruit or vegetables in the jars for 
three days in succession to insure the destruction of all 
germ life. 

5. Sterilizing, or Processing. These terms are used 
interchangeably and refer to the steaming, or boiling, of 
the filled jars for the purpose of destroying all spores, 
germs and bacteria. Needless to say, this is the most 
important part of the whole process, for if sterilization is 
incomplete the canned goods will not keep. 

To achieve good results in the home process of canning 
it is absolutely necessary to follow the directions carefully 
and to make sure that the products actually sterilize the 
right length of time. It is a very easy matter, for in- 
stance, to prepare half a dozen jars of corn and to leave 
them sterilizing in the kitchen while work is being done 
in another part of the house. However, the fire may get 
low, and the jars actually sterilize by means of the boil- 
ing water only two hours instead of the necessary three. 
The corn would spoil; the method would be blamed, 
while the real trouble would center around carelessness. 
When vegetables or fruits demanding a long period of 
sterilization are to be canned, they should be put on the 
first thing in the morning, before the breakfast dishes are 
washed, so that the housewife may be " on the job " all 
the time while doing up her kitchen work and preparing 
dinner. If a short-time-vegetable or fruit, as asparagus, 
or tomatoes, or soft berries, is to be canned, the work may 
be accomplished in odd periods, whenever other short- 
time work is in progress in the kitchen. Unless it is 
necessary to can in large quantities, to save foods that 
would otherwise spoil, or in order to save money by pur- 
chasing in large quantities, canning may be done a few 
jars at a time in a kettle of moderate size, equipped with a 
round wire rack to hold the jars. If two or three jars of 



690 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

each fruit and an equal number of suitable vegetables are 
canned as they come in season, the housewife with a small 
family will find that during the period from May through 
October she will have accumulated a wide range of foods 
at comparatively little cost and labor. The collection 
should begin with rhubarb, going through the whole 
gamut of fruits and berries and continuing through 
quinces and citrons. The vegetables may begin with as- 
paragus and continue through sweet potatoes and pump- 
kin. 

Whatever the vegetable or fruit the general processes 
of preparation and sterilization are the same. 

1. Scald or blanch the food according to the length of 
time noted in the table. 

2. Dip in cold water. 

3. Remove the skins, if necessary, any cores, blossom 
ends, stems or stones, according to the nature of the food 
to be canned. 

4. Pack into wide-mouth jars as closely as possible. 

5. Fill the jars almost full with the desired liquid and 
add salt according to directions, if needed. 

6. Adjust the rubber and top and partially clamp it on, 
or if a mason jar is being used, screw the top down until 
it touches the rubber, but do not close the jar, as other- 
wise the expanded air cannot escape. 

7. Cover with water, two inches over the tops, bring 
to boiling point and boil, or sterilize, the required length 
of time. 

8. Remove, the jars, tighten the covers and turn them 
upside down on a cloth away from a draft, covering them 
with a cloth so that a sudden breeze will not cause the 
jars to crack. 

9. After a few days, loosen the clamps and pick up the 
jars by the covers. If sterilization has been complete, 
the covers will not come off. Clamp again and put the 
jars away, after, wrapping them in paper to assist in pre- 
serving the color. 

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING 
VEGETABLES 

Allow a level teaspoonful each of salt and sugar to 
each quart of boiling water -used in canning the vege- 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 691 

tables. Substitute the juice obtained by boiling tomatoes 
for water in canning tomatoes. Use absolutely fresh 
vegetables. This is especially true for corn and peas. 
Scrub all root and tuber vegetables as carrots, sweet pota- 
toes and the like, thoroughly with a vegetable brush, 
then scald in boiling water to remove the skins. In can- 
ning corn on the cob remove the husks and silk and 
blanch the corn on the cob eight minutes for medium- 
sized ears, five for smaller ears and longer for the larger 
ears. Re-steam it when taken from the can for serving, 
rather than boiling it a second time. In preparing corn, 
(cut from the cob) blanch it on, then remove the kernels 
with a sharp knife. String be'ans before blanching. 
Clean greens thoroughly ; then steam. In canning pump- 
kin and squash for pie fillings, steam until tender, then 
mash, add a cupful of sugar and a teaspoonful of salt to 
each quart of pulp, then sterilize as directed. All vege- 
tables and fruits should be graded according to size so 
that the various pieces will cook through in the same 
time. This adds greatly to the appearance of the fin- 
ished jar as well. 

Canning powders should never be used. They contain 
boric, or salicylic, acid, which are drugs and have no 
place in foods. At the same time their use is absolutely 
unnecessary if care is used in canning and they are an 
additional expense. Finally, most of them contain in- 
gredients which are prohibited, or forbidden in many 
States and by the National Government. 

If desired, special seasonings may be added to the jars 
of vegetables, along with the salted water; for instance, 
pickled young carrots are delicious. In this case a half 
cupful of vinegar, a tablespoonful of sugar and a table- 
spoonful of whole pickle spice could be added to each 
pint jar of carrots. Pickled beets may be made in the 
same way. All kinds of greens may be canned, accord- 
ing to the time table given below ; these include the edible 
wild greens as well, such as milkweed, sour dock, purs- 
lane, etc. In canning greens, cabbage or Brussels sprouts, 
it is a good plan to season them by putting into the center 
of each jar a thin slice of fat bacon, salt pork, a little 
minced raw ham, dried beef, or olive oil.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING 
FRUITS 

Fruits may be canned with, or without sugar, but it is 
a saving of both time and fuel if a syrup composed of the 
proper proportions of sugar is used to fill up the can, 
rather than plain water. However, if sugar is prohibi- 
tive in price and fruit must be canned, it may be done by 
the plain water process. In this case the unsweetened 
fruit should be drained from the juice before serving, 
the right quantity of sugar added to the juice and the 
whole boiled together for a few minutes, the fruit being 
added in time so that it may be thoroughly sweetened. 
By this method, however, the fruit is always over-cooked 
by the second heating and the fruit loses brilliancy both 
of flavor and color. 

Syrups of different densities are used in the canning 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 693 

of fruits, the choice depending on the tartness of the 
fruit and the richness of the result desired. The follow- 
ing table gives the amounts of sugar and water needed in 
preparing syrups of different percentages ; the syrups 
will hereafter be designated in this chapter by the den- 
sity, or percentage.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING 
FRUITS 

The general directions for canning fruits have already 
been given. The steps in the process are the same as in 
the canning of vegetables except that it is not always 
necessary to blanch the fruit. The same principles are 
applied; however, there are a few additional points that 
should be especially noted. The fruit should be fresh, 
firm, but ripe, entirely free from all leaves and stems, 
and from rot, blemish or mould. If gritty, as with 
strawberries, it should be thoroughly cleaned. 

The skins should be removed from peaches, apricots, 
pears, oranges, apples and quinces by blanching. 
Soft fruits which are of a sweet nature, like straw- 
berries, raspberries, loganberries, huckleberries, or blue- 
berries, figs and wild and Damson plums, as well as 
grapes, need no blanching ; but sour berry fruits, as cur- 
rants, gooseberries, cranberries and sour cherries are bet- 
ter if quickly blanched. Pineapple and citron need 
longer blanching because they are harder. It is not 
necessary to fill the can to overflowing with boiling water 
or syrup, whichever is to be used ; it is enough to fill it 
within a fourth of an inch of the top. 

In every case where the skin, cores, or seeds are to be 
removed the blanching and cold-dip should take place 
before it is done, as otherwise there is liable to be con- 
siderable loss of flavor. The stones should be removed 



694 



MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 



from peaches and apricots and the fruit canned in halves. 
If desired, one peach stone may be allowed to a jar to 
enhance the flavor. Pineapple should be pared, the eyes 
removed and the pineapple cut in convenient pieces be- 
fore blanching. Citron, cantaloupe and oranges should 
also be pared before blanching.

The syrups indicated in the table are of the sweetness 
used by the best commercial canners. If desired, richer 
syrups may be used, but if this is done there is danger of 
introducing too much sugar into the dietary. 

In so far as possible it is better to prepare, blanch and 
pack one or two jars of a product at a time. This is 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 695 

especially true of corn, peas, beans and asparagus. Care 
should be taken that unbroken vegetables and fruit be 
packed into jars, if appearances are to be considered. 

Mold may develop if the seal is defective or if the jar 
tops are removed to slip the rubbers back into position. 
If this is done, the jars must be re-sterilized for five min- 
utes. Mold may also appear if jars are kept in a damp 
place where the rubbers may decompose. The best 
water for canning purposes is pure, soft and free from 
excessive quantities of mineral matter. If any difficulty 
is experienced through the water, consult with the office 
of Home Economics States Relation Service. Washing- 
ton, D. C. 

In canning either fruits or vegetables the altitude 
makes a difference, the higher the altitude the lower the 
degree of heat needed to boil water. These directions 
are based upon an altitude of five hundred feet. For 
every four thousand feet increase there should be an 
addition of twenty per cent, to the time required for can- 
ning the different foods. 

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING SOUPS 

Meat scraps, bones, ligaments and odds and ends of 
vegetables and cereals may be made into excellent soups 
and canned for later usage. This is thoroughly practi- 
cal and is one of the best ways in which thrift can be 
exploited. The soup must first be made, packed hot in 
glass jars, or bottles, partially sealed as is directed in 
the previous part of the chapter and sterilized the proper 
length of time. Cream soups cannot be canned, but the 
sifted vegetable pulp, or puree, properly seasoned, which 
acts as a foundation for the cream soup may be canned 
and used as needed with twice the quantity of milk, or 
with equal parts of milk, and chicken or veal stock 
(white stock). 

CANNED STOCK SOUPS 

The amount of time needed in making soup stock is 
the same for a large quantity as for a quart or two. It 
is an economy of both time and fuel to prepare a large 
quantity at a time and can it ready for use whenever 



696 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

needed. The recipes given for the making of soup 
stock, bouillon and consomme, in the chapter on Soups, 
may be used for canned soups. The time of sterilization 
is forty minutes for the hot-water-bath outfit, thirty 
minutes with the water-seal outfit and twenty-five min- 
utes with the steam-pressure outfit. 

VEGETABLE STOCK SOUPS 

Vegetable stock soups, as julienne, and soups with any 
kind of cereal thickening, as rice, barley, or tapioca, may 
also be canned. For the desired recipes see the chapter 
on Soups. Sterilize soups of this type ninety minutes in 
the hot-water-bath outfit, and seventy-five minutes in the 
water seal, or five-pound steam-pressure outfit. 

PUREES OF DRIED VEGETABLES 

Soups of this type may be made of split peas, cow 
peas, yellow-eyed beans, black beans, kidney beans, navy 
beans, lima beans. The pulp must first be prepared and 
is then combined with the soup-stock and sterilized ninety 
minutes with the hot-water-bath outfit, eighty minutes 
with the water seal and seventy minutes with the steam- 
pressure outfit. 



GENERAL PROPORTIONS OF DRIED 
VEGETABLES TO STOCK 

DRIED PEA SOUP 

Eight pounds of dried peas soaked over night, cooked 
until soft, sifted and added to five and a half gallons of 
soup stock, thickened with two cupfuls of flour, mixed 
with additional stock to a smooth paste, salted and sweet- 
ened to taste, and brought to a boil ; fill into cans and 
sterilize. Any kind of peas may be used and the sea- 
soning may be varied with onion, mint, bay leaves or 
celery tips, added "to the stock when it is put on to heat. 

DRIED BEAN SOUP 

Three pounds of dried beans soaked over night in cold 
water and cooked soft with 3 pounds hock of harn and 
4 gallons of water. When the beans are soft, strain 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 697 

them from the stock and sift them. Shred the ham, or 
put it through a food chopper, and return it to the liquor. 
Thicken with a cupful of flour, rubbed smooth with a 
little stock, fill into jars and sterilize. A few onions, or 
a little tomato pulp may be added to this soup when the 
beans are put on to boil. 

CANNED VEGETABLE PULP 

Tomatoes, peas, carrots, asparagus, egg plant, squash, 
fresh lima beans or any other pulpy vegetable may be 
boiled in as little water as possible, the proper season- 
ings added, the pulp sifted, filled while hot into jars and 
sterilized the length of time demanded by that particular 
vegetable. See the time table for sterilizing vegetables 
given in the previous part of this chapter. 



MIXED VEGETABLES 

To save garden waste, it is a good plan to can mixed 
vegetables, to be added to soup stock later on. The 
Government suggests that the following general propor- 
tions be observed. Soak 6 pounds of lima beans and 4 
pounds of dried peas over night. Boil each one-half 
hour. Blanch 16 pounds of carrots, 6 pounds cabbage, 3 
pounds celery, 6 pounds of turnips, 4 pounds of okra, I 
pound of onions and 4 pounds of parsley for three min- 
utes and in cold water, quickly. Prepare the vegetables 
and chop into small cubes. Chop the onions and celery 
extra fine. Mix all of the above thoroughly and season to 
taste. Pack in glass jars or tin cans. Fill with boiling 
water. Partially seal glass jars, cap and tin cans. Ster- 
ilize ninety minutes with the hot-water-bath outfit; sixty 
minutes with the water-seal outfit or five-pounds steam- 
pressure outfit. 



SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING MEATS 

Success in canning meats depends upon good jars, 
good rubbers and proper sterilization. All kinds of meat 
may be canned by either one of the following methods : 

Fowl or game should be drawn as soon as killed, care- 



698 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

fully washed and cooled and cut into convenient sections. 
Beef, veal, lamb and mutton should be cooled quickly and 
kept for about twenty-four hours. Corned beef should 
be corned the proper length of time, then soaked for two 
hours in clear water to freshen it, the water being 
changed once. Pork should be cooled quickly after 
butchering and kept in a 'cool place for at least twenty- 
four hours. Only the lean portions should be canned. 

CANNED CHICKEN, GAME OR VEAL 

Cut the meat into convenient sections and boil until it 
can be removed from the bones. Remove from the boil- 
ing liquid, pick off the meat, and pack it closely into jars. 
In the meantime boil down the stock one-half, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt to each quart jar of meat, fill the jars 
with the stock, adjust the rubbers and caps and sterilize 
three and a half hours with the hot-water-bath outfit, 
three hours with the water seal and two and a half hours 
with the five-pound steam-pressure outfit. 

If undesirable previously to cook the meat, cut it into 
sections, pack it into the jars, and fill in with boiling 
water, adding a teaspoonful of salt to each quart jar. 
Adjust the rubbers and caps and sterilize four hours in 
the water-bath outfit, three and a half in the water-seal 
and three hours in the five-pound steam-pressure outfit. 

CANNED BEEF, LAMB, OR MUTTON 

Cut the meat in convenient slices for handling, and 
roast, or boil slowly for thirty minutes. Cut into small 
pieces, remove the gristle, bone and excessive fat and 
pack directly into the jars. Fill the jars with gravy 
from the roasting pan, or with stock, if the meat has been 
boiled, cooked down one-half, adjust the rubbers and 
caps and sterilize four hours in the water-bath outfit, 
four hours in the water-seal and three and a half in the 
five-pound steam pressure outfit. 

CANNED CORNED BEEF 

Freshen the corned beef as directed in the general sug- 
gestions, boil it slowly for thirty minutes, then plunge it 
into cold water. Remove the gristle, bone and excessive 
fat ; cut the meat into small pieces, pack closely into jars, 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 699 

put the rubbers and caps into position and sterilize four 
hours in the water-bath outfit, four hours in the water- 
seal and three hours in the five-pound steam-pressure 
outfit. 

CANNED PORK 

Boil or roast the meat for thirty minutes. Cut into 
small sections, after removing the bone, gristle and ex- 
cess fat, and pack closely into glass jars. Adjust the 
rubbers and caps and sterilize four hours in the water- 
bath outfit, three hours in the water-seal and three hours 
in the five-pound steam-pressure outfit. 

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING FISH 

Make a brine of salt and cold water that will float a 
potato and, after cleaning the fish properly, let it stand in 
the brine for thirty minutes. Remove from the brine, 
cut into convenient sections, pack into glass jars, adding 
a teaspoonful of salt to each quart jar. If the skin is 
not removed, pack the jar so that the skin will be next 
the glass. If possible, remove the bones before packing 
the fish ; sterilize three hours in the water-bath outfit, 
three hours in the water-seal and two and a half hours in 
the five-pound steam-pressure outfit. Use only fresh 
fish. 

CANNED OYSTERS OR CLAMS 

Select fresh products, not more than twenty-four hours 
out of the water. Rinse carefully in fresh salted water 
and plunge the clams or oysters into boiling water for a 
few minutes. Pack into glass jars, add a teaspoonful of 
salt to each quart jar, adjust the rubbers and caps and 
sterilize three hours in a water-bath outfit, two in a water- 
seal and one and a half hours in a five-pound steam- 
pressure outfit. 

JAMS, MARMALADES AND CONSERVES 

All three of these preserves may be made of a single 
fruit or of a mixture of two or more fruits. Berries, cur- 
rants and gooseberries should be washed and then 
mashed, while firm fruits, like apples, peaches and pears, 



700 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

should be washed, pared and cored, or stoned, then sliced. 
The fruit should stand in alternate layers with sugar for 
several hours to extract the juices. Berries and juicy 
fruits do not need the addition of any water, but drier 
fruits, such as apples and pears, should have a little 
added to start the juices. They should be brought slowly 
to the boiling point and then simmered until so thick that 
a little will stiffen if dropped on a cold plate. For each 
pound of fruit used, after preparing, allow^three-fourths 
of a pound of granulated sugar, or one-half pound of 
granulated sugar and one- fourth pound of white corn 
syrup. 

Pour the preserves into jars or glasses, boiled for five 
minutes, and, when cool, seal with melted paraffine and 
cover, or paste brown paper over the tops. If desired, 
they may be put into pint jars, the rubbers and caps 
adjusted, and then sterilized twenty minutes in the hot- 
water bath, or ten minutes in the water-seal or in the five- 
pound steam-pressure outfit. This is an extra precau- 
tion against spoilage. 

Blackberry Jam 

See general directions for making jam. 

Raspberry or Strawberry Jam 

See general directions for making jam. If desired, the 
raspberries may be combined with one-quarter their 
weight in currants, or may be used with equal parts of 
blueberries. Or strawberries may be combined with an 
equal amount of diced, unpeeled rhubarb. 

Loganberry Jam 
See general directions for making jam. 

Cherry Jam 

Use rather sweet cherries. Remove the stones, and 
follow general directions for making jam. 

Gooseberry Jam 

Stem and wash the gooseberries, mash and cook gently 
in their own juices until they are tender. Add an equal

parts of gooseberries and currants may be used. 

Dried Peach or Apricot Jam 

1 pound dried apricots or Water 
peaches I orange 

2 lemons Sugar 

Wash the fruit and soak it over night, with the orange 
and lemon sliced thin, rind and all. Then stew very 
slowly in the same water barely to cover and sift through 
a colander. Add two-thirds as much sugar by measure 
as fruit pulp, simmer very slowly until thick; seal as 
usual or sterilize in jars if desired. 

Peach Marmalade 

Blanch the peaches, remove the skins and stones and 
chop the pulp fine. Add two-thirds the weight of sugar 
and cook slowly until thick, about thirty-five minutes. 
Seal as usual or sterilize in jars if desired. 

Grape Marmalade 

7 cupfuls sifted grape pulp i pound chopped English 

2 cupfuls grape skins walnuts

Cook the grape pulp to a mush and sift it. In the 
meantime, simmer the skins until tender in water to 
cover, add the raisins, combine with the sifted pulp and 
the sugar and simmer until thick, then add the nut meats 
and cook half an hour longer. Seal as directed, or ster- 
ilize in jars if desired. 

Rhubarb Marmalade 

10 cupfuls diced rhubarb 4 lemons 

2 cupfuls chopped walnut I cupful raisins 
meats 10 cupfuls sugar 

Do not peel the rhubarb. Put it in a kettle, add a pint 
of water and boil gently until soft, then add the nuts, 
sugar, lemon juice and the grated lemon rind. Cook 
gently until thick, about forty minutes, and seal as usual, 
or sterilize in jars. 

Pineapple Marmalade 
Pare and remove the eyes from four medium-sized 



702 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

pineapples, which should be ripe, but not soft. Shred 
the pineapple, and add one orange sliced very thin and a 
thinly-sliced lemon. Cook the mixture for a few min- 
utes until reduced in bulk, then measure and stir in two- 
thirds the amount of sugar. Simmer until thick and 
translucent. Then seal in sterilized jelly glasses. 

Orange Marmalade 

4 oranges Sugar 

3 lemons Water 

2 grapefruit 

Slice the fruit very thin, leaving on the rinds of three 
of the oranges and one grapefruit. Weigh and add two 
cupfuls of water to each pound of fruit, letting it stand 
twenty- four hours. Then boil for one hour, set aside in a 
cool place for twenty-four hours and to each pound of 
fruit juice add two cupfuls of sugar. Boil slowly for an 
hour, skimming as necessary, and pour into sterilized 
glasses, as usual, or sterilize in jars if desired. Be care- 
ful to omit the seeds and use thin-skinned fruit if possible. 

Kumquat Marmalade 

2 quarts kumquats Water 

2 lemons \ pound pecan nut meats 
Sugar (optional) 

Wash the kumquats, cut in quarters, rejecting the 
seeds ; slice the lemons, taking out the seeds, weigh com- 
bined fruits and add two cupfuls of water to each pound 
of fruit, letting it stand twenty-four hours. Then boil 
gently for an hour, drain the fruit from the liquid and 
chop it. Return the pulp to the liquid, measure it, add 
an equal quantity of sugar and boil gently till thick. If 
the nuts are to be used, they should be added with the 
sugar. Seal as usual in sterilized glasses. 

Fig Conserve 

i pound dried "figs 2 cupfuls chopped walnut 

3 cupfuls sugar meats 

\ cupful orange juice 2 cupfuls^ raisins, halved 

cupful lemon juice Grated rind one orange 

Wash the figs and soak over night with the raisins in 
water to cover. Cook until tender in the same water, 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 703 

then chop fine and simmer until almost thick enough. 
Then stir in the nut meats, finish cooking and seal in 
sterilized glasses. 

Cranberry Conserve 

I quart cranberries I cupful raisins 

i cupful water 2 cupfuls sugar 

Juice and pulp 2 oranges 

Cook the cranberries, oranges, raisins and water to- 
gether until the cranberries burst, and the whole mixture 
is soft. Add the sugar, let simmer until thick and seal 
as usual in sterilized glasses. 

Yellow Tomato Preserves 

6 pounds yellow tomatoes i cupful minced green gin- 

i pound sugar ger root 

Juice and grated rind of 
i lemon 

Blanch the tomatoes and remove the skins. Add the 
sugar, the lemon juice and rind and the ginger root. Let 
stand over night, then cook gently until half done. Pour 
into jars. Adjust the rubbers and caps and sterilize 
twenty minutes in the hot-water-bath outfit, or fifteen 
minutes in the water-seal or five-pound steam-pressure 
outfit. 

Preserved Pears with Ginger 

8 pounds winter pears 6 lemons 

5 pounds sugar i pound candied ginger 

Blanch the pears, remove the skins and cut the pulp in 
small pieces. Slice the lemons very thin, leaving on the 
rind of two of them. Chop the ginger and add it to the 
pears with the sugar and lemons. Cover and let stand 
twenty-four hours ; then simmer until translucent. Pour 
into jars, adjust the rubbers and caps and cook ten 
minutes in the hot-water-bath outfit. 

Preserved Cherries 

Select sour red cherries. Remove the stones. Put 
the cherries in alternate layers in the preserving kettle, 
with half their weight in sugar, and one-fourth their 
weight in honey. (All sugar may be used if desired.) 
Let stand twenty-four hours, and then simmer gently 



704 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

until the cherries are tender. Pour into glass jars, ad- 
just the caps and rubbers, and sterilize ten minutes in the 
hot-water-bath outfit. 

Green Tomato Preserves 

4 quarts green tomatoes, i pint water 

sliced 3 cupfuls sugar 

4 lemons 

Wash the lemons and slice very thin. Simmer in the 
water until the rinds are tender; turn in the tomatoes 
and simmer until translucent. Then add the sugar. 
Cook until thick and rich and pour into sterilized jars, 
filling them full. Adjust the rubbers and caps and ster- 
ilize ten minutes in the hot-water-bath outfit. 

Preserved Strawberries 

Hull the berries and measure them. Allow an equal 
quantity of sugar. Place in alternate layers with the 
sugar in the preserving kettle, let stand a few moments, 
then bring rapidly to boiling point, stirring all the time, 
and boil for ten minutes. Pour into sterilized glasses, 
and, when cool, seal with paraffine. 

Preserved Strawberries Cold Method 

Wash and hull the berries. Weigh them, and then 
weigh out once and a quarter their weight in sugar. 
Mash the berries and put a layer in a scalded stone crock. 
Add a layer of sugar and then one of berries and con- 
tinue until all are used. Stand in a cold place for 
twenty-four hours, stirring occasionally, then seal in 
sterilized jars. 



SUN-DRIED PRESERVES (COOKED METHOD) 

Raspberries, Strawberries and Cherries 
Wash the fruit and hull the strawberries, or stone the 
cherries. Look over the raspberries carefully to see that 
there are no insects. Weigh the fruit, and to each pound 
allow one pound of granulated sugar. Put in alternate 
layers with the sugar in a preserving kettle and heat 
slowly. Set the kettle on an asbestos mat, so that the 
fruit will not burn, but it will not be necessary to stir it. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 705 

Boil gently for eight minutes, then pour into large enamel 
pans or platters to about one-fourth inch in thickness. 
Let stand in the hot sun for a day when it should be 
thickened or slightly jellied. If the sun is not very hot, 
it may be necessary to let it stand for two days. A good 
place is a piazza, roof which has a metal top. Store in 
sterilized jars and seal with paraffine. 

Sun-Dried Fruits (Uncooked Method) 
Ripe apricots, peaches, cherries, raspberries and straw- 
berries may be preserved in this way. 

Hull the strawberries, remove the skins from the 
peaches and apricots, and stone the cherries according 
to the fruit that is to be used. Slice the apricots or 
peaches thin. Lay on enamel pans or platters ; sprinkle 
thickly with granulated sugar. Use the same method for 
the strawberries or cherries. Let stand in the hot sun 
for a day or two, but take the fruit in at night, and turn 
it over occasionally. Care must be taken to select only 
perfect fruit. Store in sterilized jars and seal with par- 
affine. 

Preserved Kumquats 

2 quarts kumquats 4 cupfuls water 

4 cupfuls sugar 

Blanch the kumquats, then boil up in cold water. 
Drain and repeat the process. Make a syrup of the sugar 
and water, boiling it for fifteen minutes, and then add 
the kumquats, cooking them until they are translucent. 
By this time the syrup will be thick and rich. Store in 
sterilized jars, filling them full to overflowing, and placing 
on the sterilized rubbers and tops. If desired, a cupful 
of honey or of white corn syrup may replace one cupful 
of sugar. 

Baked Strawberry Preserve 

Wash and hull the strawberries. Measure, and to 
each two heaping cupfuls allow a level cupful of sugar 
and two tablespoonfuls of hot water. Put in layers in a 
bean pot or other large baking dish, cover and let stand 
half an hour to start the juices. Then place in a cold 
oven and turn on both gas burners. After ten minutes 
turn off one and reduce the other burner half, or bake in 



706 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

a slow coal or electric oven. Cook forty minutes. 
Transfer to sterilized glasses and seal with melted paraf- 
fme. 

To make a very rich jam, like the " sun-dried " variety, 
spread the oven-baked strawberries one-fourth of an inch 
deep on platters or enameled trays and bake very slowly 
for an hour. Seal as above. 

Baked Plum Preserve 

Wash the plums, remove the stones and measure the 
fruit. Then proceed as directed in Baked Strawberry 
Preserve. Purple plums are best for this purpose. 

Quince Honey 

2 large quinces 2 cupfuls water 

I quart sugar 

Pare the quinces and grate them. In the meantime 
boil together the sugar and water for five minutes. Then 
add the quinces, and boil until they look translucent, 
about eight minutes. Place in sterilized jars and seal 
with melted paraffine. 



APPLE, PLUM, PEACH, GRAPE AND QUINCE 
BUTTER 

Wash the fruit thoroughly. Cut the hard fruits in 
pieces but do not remove skins or cores. Crush the 
grapes, if used. Cover the fruit with cold water, bring 
to boiling point and cook until soft. Then rub through 
a coarse sieve to remove the seeds and cores. Measure 
the pulp and to each quart allow half as much sugar, 
either granulated or light brown, and a tablespoonful of 
powdered cinnamon and J tablespoonful of ground clove. 
Return to the heat ; simmer until thick, and store in ster- 
ilized jars. The apple butter is improved if sweet cider 
is substituted for the water in the preliminary boiling. 

If desired, the pulp left from making jelly may be used 
in making these butters by adding more water, allowing 
the mixture to come to a boil and then proceeding as 
though fresh fruit had been used. If desired, a little 
fresh fruit may be added, and the sifted fruit combined 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 707 

with it. Combinations of fruits may be used in making 
these butters as equal parts of apples and quinces, peaches 
and apples, or plums and apples. 

Tomato Butter 

Use yellow or red tomatoes. Plunge them into hot 
water, remove the skins and stew the tomatoes with a 
few cloves and a little stick of cinnamon. Sift the mix- 
ture and to each quart of pulp allow two-thirds as much 
granulated or light brown sugar. Stew very slowly until 
the mixture is thick, and store in stone crocks. A mix- 
ture of tomato and apple gives delicious results. 

CANNING FRUIT JUICES 

The juice from any type of fruit may be canned, the 
method being the same for all kinds, the only difference 
being that if dry or hard fruits are used, it will be neces- 
sary to add a little water to start the juices, while if soft 
fruits are used, like grapes or blackberries, the water is 
not necessary. It is an economy of space and jars to 
make the fruit juice very condensed, diluting it, when 
using, with the desired amount of water. 

A much better color and flavor is obtained if the fruit 
is not cooked directly over the heat, but rather is 
steamed. 

The amount of sugar to be used depends upon the 
kind of fruit juice, but, generally speaking, from one-half 
to a cupful of sugar is ample for a quart of juice if a 
sweet result is desired. But if it is not practicable to add 
the sugar when the fruit juice is being put up, it will 
keep equally well without it, and if desired may be used 
late'r on in the season for making jellies. 

When there are a great many apples on hand they may 
form the basis for delicious jellies made with an apple 
foundation combined with any desired proportion of 
canned fruit juices, the flavor of the jelly being almost as 
good as when the more expensive fruit is entirely used. 

Method for Soft Fruits 

Wash and crush the fruit in a good-sized preserving 
kettle. To each peck of fruit allow a pint of water. Set 
this kettle in a hot-water bath, that is, a kettle of larger 



708 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

size containing hot water, and steam the fruit until it is 
tender and the juices run freely. Strain through a 
flannelette jelly bag. Pour the juice into jars or bottles 
with patent tops. Adjust the rubbers and tops and ster- 
ilize thirty minutes for pint jars and sixty minutes for 
larger jars, in the hot-water-bath 5 pouring in water only 
to the necks of the bottles, if used. 

Method for Hard Fruits 

Hard fruit juices may be obtained in the same way 
by using more water and cooking the fruit in the kettle 
for a longer time. 

If sugar is to be added, it should be mixed into the 
strained juice. If the bag is squeezed, the juice will be 
cloudy, but it may be used as " seconds " for jelly-mak- 
ing. If ordinary bottles are used, they should be filled 
with the liquid, and boiled in the water-bath as for the 
patent bottles, the tops being stuffed with absorbent cot- 
ton. The tops should be dipped in melted paraffine to 
form a perfect seal. 

JELLY-MAKING 

Success in jelly-making largely depends, not upon 
" good luck or bad luck " but upon whether or not pec- 
tin (a vegetable starch that stiffens the jelly) is present 
in sufficient quantities to make it harden. Most of the 
pectin is present in the skins and cores of the fruits and 
is found in greater abundance in under-ripe fruit, and in 
lesser amount in fruit that is ripe. So, if possible, choose 
fruits that are a little green, or at least not over-ripe. 

Wash the fruit, and> if it is of a juicy type like cur- 
rants or grapes, crush it in a preserving kettle, setting this 
in turn in a larger utensil containing hot water to form a 
hot-water bath. Cook gently until the fruit is tender 
and the juice is running freely. Then drain through a 
flannelette jelly bag, but do not squeeze it if a clear effect 
is desired. In using hard fruits, as apples, add enough 
water to keep them from burning and boil them until they 
are soft. 

Testing the Juices for Pectin 

To make sure that the jelly will stiffen, put 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of the unboiled and unsweetened juice in a tumbler 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 709 

and add 2 teaspoonfuls of grain alcohol. Stir until well- 
mixed, and let stand for half an hour. If a jelly-like 
substance collects in the bottom of the tumbler, it is evi- 
dent that pectin or the jelly -making principle of fruits is 
present. If pectin is lacking, boil a few apples (as these 
are rich in pectin), some green citron melon, or the 
white inner skin of a few oranges, and add it to the 
fruit juices. This inner skin of the oranges may be 
saved the year through and dried to be ready for such an 
emergency. 

Finishing the Jelly 

Measure the juice. Then bring to boiling point and boil 
rapidly for twenty minutes. Add to this three-fourths 
the quantity of granulated sugar, warmed in the oven, or 
one-half the quantity of sugar, and one-fourth the quan- 
tity of white corn syrup. Boil briskly until two rows of 
drops form on the end of a spoon held sidewise. The 
temperature is usually about 220 F. Pour into steril- 
ized glasses. Let stiffen and, when cool, seal with 
melted paraffine. 

Most common fruits may be made into jellies if they 
are sound, not too ripe, although pear jelly is difficult to 
make. If, however, the pears are combined with apples 
this difficulty may be overcome. Apples and cranberries 
in the proportion of one quart of cranberries to a peck 
of apples; apples and quinces, in the proportion of 2 
quinces to 2 quarts of apples ; apples, with any other 
canned fruit juices in the proportion of a quart of juice 
to a peck of apples, will make delicious jelly. Green- 
skinned apples alone make a clear amber jelly and red- 
skinned apples make jelly of a deep pink color. Cur- 
rants and raspberries, or loganberries, are delicious in 
combination, while blackberries may be reinforced by 
apples to keep down expense. Barberries and apples in 
the proportion of a quart of barberries and a peck of 
apples make a delicious jelly. They are especially suit- 
able to serve with game. Elderberries may be used 
either alone or in combination with equal parts of ripe 
grapes or currants. 

It is usually customary to make jellies of the fruit 
juices and sugar only, but if desired a little whole spice 
may be cooked with the fruit juice, a little orange or 



7io MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

lemon rind may be added, or, in case the juice seems in- 
sipid, a little lemon juice. Old-fashioned cooks still use 
a rose geranium leaf or a spray of lemon verbena in their 
apple jelly. 

PICKLING 

The making of ordinary sour or sweet pickles, as gher- 
kins or green tomatoes, may be successfully done at 
home, without the use of preserving powders, alum, or a 
copper or brass kettle to make them green. All of these 
methods of preserving the color are inimical to health 
and should be absolutely avoided. 

In making whole cucumber pickles, select the fresh 
vegetable, and brush rather than wash them. They 
should then be put in brine because the brine draws out 
the moisture and therefore makes a more compact and 
firm pickle. Because salt is a preservative the prelim- 
inary soaking in brine also assists in keeping the pickles 
for an indefinite period. The brine should not be too 
strong lest it soften the vegetable. 

Brine for Pickles 

Add enough ordinary salt to a quart of water to float 
a fresh egg .about one-half cupful. 

To Keep Pickles Green 

The old-fashioned method of lining the preserving 
kettle in pickle-making with grape leaves, cabbage leaves 
and covering the mixture with them, gives a delicious 
flavor and assists in retaining the color. A few cherry 
leaves or tendrils of grape vines are an addition. 

Sour Cucumber Pickles 

Let the cucumbers stand in a brine for twenty- four 
hours. Then drain them. Cover with pickle vinegar, 
and bring to boiling point. Transfer the pickles to jars 
and cover with the vinegar.

2 onions if ounces whole cloves 

i medium-sized cabbage i ounce whole allspice 

I head celery I cupful salt 

li cupfuls brown sugar Vinegar 
ii cupfuls granulated sugar 

Wash the tomatoes and peppers. Remove the bloom 
ends from the tomatoes and the seeds from the peppers. 
Peel the onions, and quarter the cabbage, removing the 
core. Clean the celery, and chop the vegetables sep- 
arately. Put in a preserving kettle in alternating layers 
with the salt and let stand over night. Then drain off 
the liquid. Tie the spices in a bit of cheescloth. Add 
to the vegetable mixture with the sugar. Cover with 



712 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

vinegar, gradually heat and simmer till the vegetables 
are translucent. Transfer to sterilized jars, and seal. 

Cucumber Chowchow 

3 quarts chopped, seeded 6 tablespoonfuls celery seed 
cucumbers ii teaspoonfuls white pepper 

ii quarts chopped onions Salt 

ii pints chopped green pep- Vinegar to cover 

pers 

Combine the cucumber, onion and peppers, and sprin- 
kle them sparingly with salt. About two tablespoonfuls 
and a half will be sufficient. Cover and let stand over 
night in a cool place. In the morning add the celery 
seed and the pepper, together with vinegar to cover, and 
store. This should not be cooked. A head of celery, or 
two cupfuls of finely-chopped cabbage, may be added if 
desired. 

Stuffed Vegetable Pickles or Mangoes 

The term " mangoes " in reality covers all sorts of 
stuffed, pickled vegetables, as cucumbers, large green 
tomatoes, green peppers and small green watermelons or 
green cantaloupes. If cucumbers are used, they should 
be short and stubby. Tomatoes should be just turning 
ripe, and melons be of about the same size. Cucum- 
bers should be pared, and the tops cut off and the seeds 
scooped out, forming cups. Tomatoes should not be 
peeled, slices from the stem ends should be removed and 
the pulp taken out. Peppers should have the stem ends 
cut off to form lids, and the seeds removed, and melons 
should have thin sections removed and the seeds taken 
out. 

The vegetable should then be put to soak over night in 
brine made in the proportion of a cupful of salt to two 
quarts of water. In the meantime, the stuffing may be 
prepared ready for use in the morning. It is impossible 
to give the exact amount, as it varies with the size of 
the vegetable cavities, but roughly the following propor- 
tions are ample to stuff two dozen medium-sized green 
peppers, and other vegetables of comparative size : 

4 quarts of finely-chopped 3 cupfuls chopped onion 
cabbage i tablespoonful ground clove 

2 quarts finely-chopped eel- i tablespoonful ground cin- 

ery namon 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 713 

i tablespoonful pepper i tablespoonful mustard seed 

i tablespoonful allspice 

Mix, cover and let stand over night; then fill the 
cavities, replace the tops, fastening them with twine or 
toothpicks, cover with cold vinegar and let stand over 
night. The next day simmer for half an hour in the 
vinegar. Remove, put in a stone crock, and cover with 
fresh cold vinegar. This completes the process for to- 
mato and pepper mangoes. In making melon and cu- 
cumber mangoes, pour off this vinegar, after standing 
twenty-four hours, add a half cupful of sugar to each 
quart, and pour scalding hot over the mangoes. Repeat 
this for three or four mornings. 

Sweet Pickled Vegetables 

2\ cupfuls mild vinegar 2 teaspoonful whole cloves 

i cupful sugar Grating of lemon rind 

2, small bay leaves i inch of stick cinnamon 

Boil together for twenty minutes ; add three cupfuls or 
more of cooked shredded carrots, being sure that the 
vinegar covers them, or substitute cooked cauliflower, 
separated from the flowerets, Brussels sprouts, sliced 
cooked beets, or cooked string beans. If desired, this 
can be made into a mixed vegetable pickle. It is always 
advisable to let the vegetables simmer for five minutes in 
the pickle. If beets are used, thinly sliced onions and a 
little caraway seed may be added. 

Sweet Pickled Pears, Peaches or Crab Apples 

I peck of peaches, pears or i quart mild vinegar 

crab apples i ounce stick cinnamon 

2. pounds brown sugar Whole cloves 

Make a syrup of the sugar, vinegar and cinnamon, 
boiling it ten minutes. Blanch the fruit. Remove the 
skins from the peaches, but leave on the skins of the 
crab apples or pears. Stick each fruit with four or five 
cloves, and cook the fruit, a few at a time, in the syrup 
until soft. Transfer to sterilized jars, and, when the 
jars are full, pour over boiling syrup, adjust the rubbers 
and caps and sterilize ten minutes in a hot-water-bath.

DRYING OR EVAPORATING FRUITS AND 
VEGETABLES 

Equipment 

Vegetables and fruits can be dried in the oven, in trays, 
or racks over the kitchen stove, or in a specially con- 
structed dryer, for there are several on the market which 
give satisfactory results. 

The small cook-stove dryers, or evaporators, are like 
ovens and are usually made of galvanized sheet iron, or of 
wood and galvanized iron in combination. They are suit- 
able for use on the top of an ordinary wood or coal 
range, or a kerosene stove. They are equipped with a 
series of small trays on which fruits or vegetables are 
placed after the preliminary preparation for drying. 

In case a large amount is to be dried in a day, as, for 
instance, ten bushels of fruit, a portable out-door evapo- 
rator is especially convenient. Or, a home-made dry kiln 
can be cheaply and easily constructed of brick and stone. 

A home-made, cook-stove dryer is inexpensive and 
easy to make. The dimensions should be 24 by 16 inches 
and the height 36 inches. A galvanized sheet-iron base 
6 inches high should be made according to these dimen- 
sions. This should flare slightly towards the bottom and 
should have two small openings for ventilation in each of 
the four sides. A box-like frame 30 inches high, made of 
i or i^ inch strips of wood, should be fitted to the base, the 
two sides being braced with ij inch strips of wood, 
placed at intervals of 3 inches. These form racks on 
which the trays may rest in the dryer. The frame should 
then be covered with tin or galvanized sheet iron, which 
may be tacked to the wooden strips of the frame. If 
more convenient, thin boards may be used instead of tin 
or sheet iron. The door should have small hinges, a 
latch or hook and should open wide. 

The bottom of the dryer should be made of perforated 
galvanized sheet iron. Two inches above this bottom a 
solid sheet of galvanized iron, three inches less in length 
and width, should be rested on two wires, fastened to the 
sides of the dryer. This will prevent the direct heat 
from coming in contact with the product, allows a free 
circulation of heat and acts as a radiator. 



7i8 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

A dryer of this size will hold eight trays, 21 by 15 
inches. The frame should be made of one-inch strips of 
wood on which galvanized screen wire should be tacked. 
The reason that these trays are not so large as the dryer 
is because it is necessary to have currents of heated air 
circulating over the product as well as through it. And 
to produce this effect, the first tray must be placed three 
inches aboye the radiator and pushed to the back, leaving 
a space in front. The next tray is even with the front, 
leaving a three-inch space in the back, and the other trays 
alternate in the same way. A ventilator should be left in 
the top of the dryer so that the moist air may pass away 
through it. 

If the drying is to be done in the oven, convenient trays 
can be made of galvanized wire screen, with the edges 
bent up an inch. Or, trays of this type may be pur- 
chased at a reasonable figure in sizes to fit all standard gas 
range ovens. As many trays as possible should be used 
in an oven at one time, and if a gas, or kerosene, stove 
is being used, an extra tray or two may be placed on 
rests on top of the oven as well. 

A very simple device for drying, which is still in use 
in some districts, consists of a good-sized wooden frame, 
about as large as the top of the coal or wood stove. 
After being covered with a galvanized screen, it is inverted 
and suspended from the ceiling above the stove, by means 
of ropes and pulleys. The vegetable or fruit is pre- 
pared, put on the screen and, when the fire is very hot, 
the rack is pulled up, away from the intense heat, and 
when the fire is slow, it should be lowered. 

GENERAL METHODS FOR DRYING OR EVAPO- 
RATING VEGETABLES 

Drying or evaporating may be accomplished entirely 
by artificial heat, or by a combination of sun and artificial 
heat. The former method is to be preferred as the 
weather is not always dependable. The reason that ar- 
tificial heat is used in conjunction with the sunshine, is 
so that all insect eggs may be killed before the product is 
stored. The sun-dried products are darker in color, but 
have as good flavor. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 719 

The vegetables must be absolutely fresh, young and 
tender; they should be thoroughly washed and cleaned. 
Only well-scoured knives should be used in paring or 
cutting. 

All vegetables should be blanched, as in canning by 
the new method, that is to say, they are prepared, placed 
in a wire basket, or cheesecloth bag, plunged into boiling 
water, for a given length of time, removed, drained and 
dried on towels, or by exposing them to the sun and air. 
This process insures a thorough cleaning, removes strong 
odors and flavors, softens and loosens the fiber and al- 
lows the moisture to evaporate more quickly and evenly. 
At the same time, the albuminous matter has been coagu- 
lated, thus hindering the escape of flavors. 

The vegetable should then be spread in a thin layer on 
the trays. The temperature should be started at 110 F. 
This can best be determined by an oven thermometer 
which can be secured at low cost. However, if one is 
not at hand, 110 F. may be secured in most gas ovens 
by having the gas lighted for about two minutes. In 
most kerosene ovens, in about the same time, and in a 
coal oven by having a very low fire and the oven door a 
little more than half open. 

The temperature should be gradually increased to 145 
F. The length of time required for drying vegetables 
varies with the size and the amount of water they con- 
tain. Generally the process takes from two and a half 
to seven hours, most vegetables being completed in the 
shorter time. The products are dry when they are brit- 
tle. 

The vegetables should be stirred, or turned, during the 
drying, trays should be moved from the lower part of the 
oven or dryer to the top to equalize the heat, and as the 
vegetables are dried two or more trays can often be com- 
bined, leaving space for a fresh lot, and making possible 
economy of both time and heat. If the oven is used, the 
door should be left slightly open. 

STORING DRIED VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

The best container is a tin box, pail, glass jar or can, 
all fitted with tight covers ; lard pails, baking powder 



720 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

cans, cocoa cans and the like should be treasured for this 
purpose. In case there are not enough cans for storing, 
small paper bags may be used, enough being put into 
each bag for one or two meals. This obviates opening 
large quantities. The bags should be labeled the up- 
per parts then being twisted to form necks which should 
be tied tight with string. To make the bags practically 
moisture- and insect-proof, paint them all over with a 
coat of melted paraffine applied with a brush, or frayed- 
end of a rope. 

These bags should be stored in a large tin con- 
tainer with a tight fitting cover, as a cracker can, large 
lard pail, or flour can. Paraffine-coated paper containers 
may be used and stored as the bags. Those who are for- 
tunate enough to have left over some of the prepared 
paper cooking bags in vogue some years ago will find 
them invaluable for this purpose. In this case, the tops 
should be folded over, twice fastened with clips and 
paraffined, the bags then being stored as directed. 

On first thought it may seem that the storage room 
needed for dried products will prove a serious problem in 
small houses, but when it is realized that a hundred 
pounds of fresh vegetables will average but ten pounds 
when dried, the matter takes care of itself, and the 
woman who has no room to store cans of fruits and 
vegetables will be able to provide food for her family 
through this condensing method. 

All dried products should be examined occasionally to 
make sure that no insect life has developed. Upon the 
slightest appearance of insects the product should be 
spread in thin layers in the sun until the insects disap- 
pear; then heated to a temperature of 160 F., and care- 
fully re-stored. They should be allowed to stand a while 
to absorb a little moisture before being stored. 

Dried Wax or String Beans 

All varieties "of string beans can be dried. Wash and 
string them carefully. Young and tender beans should 
be kept whole; those that are full-grown being cut in 
lengths up to an inch rather than snapped. They should 
then be blanched six minutes for tender beans, ten 
minutes for mature beans, in boiling water containing a 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 721 

half teaspoonful of soda to the gallon. Finish accord- 
ing to the general method for drying vegetables, starting 
the temperature at 110 F. and raising gradually to 145 
F. 

Dried Green Lima Beans 

Shell the beans, wash and blanch them as described 
from five to ten minutes according to maturity. Finish 
according to the general method for drying vegetables, 
keeping the temperature the same as for string beans. 

Dried Garden Peas 

Shell and blanch the peas as described from three to 
five minutes and finish according to the general method 
for drying vegetables, keeping the temperature as for 
string beans. 

' Sweet Corn 

Gather young and tender corn, remove the husks and 
silk and boil or steam it on the cob from eight to ten 
minutes to set the milk. In boiling, use a teaspoonful of 
salt to four quarts of water. Drain well. Cut the corn 
from the cob with a sharp knife, only half way down to 
the cob. Scrape out the remainder of the grain, being 
careful not to include any of the hull. Dry as directed 
in string beans. 

If field corn is used, select plump, roasting ears. 

To dry corn in the sun, prepare it as directed, diy it 
for fifteen minutes in the oven, completing the process in 
the sun. It should then be heated to 160 F. to kill any 
insect eggs. 

Dried Carrots, Parsnips, Kalarabi, Celeriac and Salsify 
Clean, scrape or pare the vegetables and slice to one- 
eighth inch thickness. Blanch as described for six 
minutes and complete the process according to the gen- 
eral method for drying vegetables, starting the tempera- 
ture at 110 F. and raising it gradually to 150 F. 

Dried Onions and Leek 

Wash the onions and peel and slice them in quarter- 
inch slices holding them under water. Blanch as de- 
scribed for five minutes in boiling water and complete ac- 
cording to the general method of drying vegetables, be- 



722 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

ginning at 110 R, and raising the temperature gradually 
to 140 F. 

Leek should be cut in quarter-inch strips. 

Dried Beets 

Wash the beets, cut off the tops to within an inch of 
the beet and boil them with the skins on until three- 
fourths done, about forty-five minutes for young beets, 
then dip in cold water, peel and slice to one-fourth inch 
thickness and complete according to the general method 
for drying vegetables, starting at 110 F., and gradually 
increasing the temperature to 150 F. 

Dried Pumpkin, Summer Squash, and Celery 

Cut the pumpkin or squash in half-inch strips and the 
celery in one-inch strips. Blanch as described three 
minutes and finish according to the general method for 
drying vegetables, starting them. at 110 F. and gradu- 
ally increasing to 150 F. 

Dried Herbs, Celery Tips, Parsley, Etc. 

Wash well and dry in the sun or in the dryer ; blanch- 
ing is not necessary. All herbs and mushroom trim- 
mings may be kept in this way. 

Method for Drying or Evaporating Fruits 
In very dry climates fruits may be evaporated entirely 
in the sun, although this causes considerable discolora- 
tion. For home use, fruit may be dried in the hot sun 
until the surface begins to wrinkle and may then be fin- 
ished in the dryer, according to the general methods de- 
scribed in evaporating vegetables. 

Select only fresh ripe fruit, wash it, prepare as neces- 
sary and spread it upon the drying trays which have been 
lined with wrapping paper or cheesecloth to prevent any 
possibility of chemical action between the fruit acids and 
the metal. The "ability to judge accurately when fruit 
has reached the proper condition for removal from the 
dryer can be gained only by experience. It should be so 
dry that it is impossible to press water out of the freshly 
cut ends of the pieces and so that none of the natural 
grain of the fruit will show when it is broken. It 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 723 

should be leathery and pliable, but not so dry that it will 
snap or crackle. Cool the fruit quickly as otherwise it 
will shrivel and look unattractive. 

Dried Berries Of All Kinds 

Wash the berries, free them from leaves and stems, 
handling them carefully to prevent bruising. Drain 
them on towels, or expose to the summer air for a few 
minutes to remove the surface moisture, then spread in 
thin layers on the trays and dry according to the general 
method described in drying vegetables, raising the tem- 
perature gradually from 110 F. to 125 F. during the 
first two hours. When a considerable portion of mois- 
ture has evaporated the temperature may be brought 
higher than 130 F., but if this is done before, there will 
be loss of juice by dripping and consequent loss of flavor 
and color. Finish drying the berries at 140 F. for two 
or three hours longer. 

Dried Cherries 

Wash but do not stone the cherries. Remove the sur- 
face moisture as directed in dried berries, spread in thin 
layers on the trays and finish according to the general 
method for drying vegetables starting at 110 F. and in- 
creasing to 150 F. It will take about four hours. 

Dried Plums 

Select good-sized medium-ripe plums. Pour over 
boiling water, cover and let stand twenty minutes. 
Drain, remove the surface moisture as in berries and 
finish according to the general method for drying vege- 
tables, starting at 110 F., and increasing gradually to 
150 F. 

Apples and Pears 

Pare, core and cut the fruit in "eighths, or core and 
slice in rings. Dip as fast as a small amount is prepared 
f6r a minute in a cold salt bath to prevent discoloration, 
using an ounce of salt to a gallon of water. Remove the 
surface moisture as in berries and finish according to 
the general method for drying vegetables, starting at 
110 F., and increasing to 150 F. The pears may be 
steamed ten minutes before drying. 



724 MRS. ALLEN'S COOK BOOK 

Dried Peaches 

Peaches are usually dried unpeeled, although they may 
be blanched and the skins removed if desired. In either 
case, cut them in halves, remove the pits, lay in the trays, 
pit-side up and finish according to the method given for 
dried vegetables, and at the same temperature as apples.

THESE pages of advertising 
have been added as an after 
thought. I find, as I go on my way 
lecturing to hundreds of thousands 
of women, that it is not enough to 
say," Use so much of a certain prod- 
uct, or such and such an amount 
of some other commodity." They 
immediately ask, "What kind is 
best, purest and most economical ? " 

And so we have added these sug- 
gestive products, all of which are 
pure according to the Westfield 
standard, the highest standard of 
pure idealism that has ever been 
established. From the chemical 
side the foods are perfect; from the 
practical side they give excellent 
results. Any kitchen equipment 
which you will find here has been 
tested and not found wanting.

Golden Rule Flavoring Extracts 

were awarded the Gold Medal at the Panama- Pacific Ex- 
position, San Francisco, 1915. As is well known, the com- 
petition at this exposition represented the entire world, 
and it should be very gratifying to the thousands of users 
of Golden Rule Flavorings to know that this award has 
been bestowed upon these extracts. This award is not 
only evidence of absolute purity, but is evidence of that 
which is often of far more importance, *. e., the highest 
quality. 

<J The steadily increasing use of Golden Rule Flavorings 

is additional evidence that these flavorings are unsur- 
passed for purity, strength, flavor, and last, but not least, 
lasting quality. They have won the approval of practically 
every user who has tried them, and in all the essential 
points that go to make a superfine extract, they are in 
a class by themselves ; and while we call attention to the 
superior quality, we especially want to bring out the fact 
to the person who has never used them that, owing to our 
method of doing business direct with the consumer, they 
are sold to the user at less than is paid for ordinary extracts. 

j[ Golden Rule Flavorings represent the last word in econ- 
omy. The products most generally adulterated, misrepre- 
sented, misbranded, and misused are flavorings. 

CJ Golden Rule Flavorings go farther, are truer in flavor, 
and contain a greater percentage of the desirable con- 
stituents than ninety-five per cent of the goods being sold. 
May be had in all flavors the vanilla, lemon, orange, 
almond, and tropical fruits being especially large sellers. 

J MRS. ALLEN says : " I have never seen so many fine extracts of 
unusual flavors as those sold by this firm. The price and quality 
of Golden Rule Extracts are made possible only by immense 
manufacturing operations and sale direct to you. They would 
have to be sold at almost double the price if sold through the 
regular broker-jobber-wholesaler-retailer-consumer channel." 

J And further says : " If you are fond of the true orange flavor, 
try the Golden Rule Orange Flavoring in cakes, ices, in fact, in 
anything, and you will pronounce it superior to the flavor you are 
able to obtain from the natural fruit."

Beech-Nut 
Peanut Butter 



BEECH-NUT PEANUT BUTTER is 
a household product that you should 
never be without. "But why Beech- 
Nut ? " you ask. Because it is made from 
a blend of only the finest Spanish and 
Virginia nuts, roasted to a delicate brown, 
the bitter hearts removed, crushed to a 
rich, creamy paste, salted, packed in 
sterilized jars and protected by the orig- 
inal vacuum seal. 

Beech-Nut Peanut Butter is rich in food 
value. In fact, a sandwich of Beech-Nut 
Peanut Butter is equal in Strength, Heat 
and Energy to a glass of full cream milk. 
Children like it and it satisfactorily solves 
the question, how to stop them from eat- 
ing too many sweets. While in soups, 
cakes, bread and in many other recipes it 
is a delicious ingredient. 

If you have never tried Beech-Nut Peanut 
Butter, do so at once. If you do you 
will never be without it. - Other Beech-

yolks well-beaten. When beginning to congeal, pour into the pastry shell and just before 
serving top with the egg whites, well beaten with four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar 
and a drop of lemon extract. Any other flavor of Jiffy-Jell may be used in the same 
way as a fruity pie filler.

1 package Pineapple or Orange Jiffy-Jell 

1 /^ cupfuls crumbled cake crumbs, any kind 
H cupful cream whipped 

<I Prepare the Jiffy-Jell as directed on the package, using only one and a half cupfuls

whipped cream. Pour into a mould, and when stiff, turn out and serve with or without 
any kind of fresh-sweetened or canned fruit.

garnish of the green, the mayonnaise, and the cheese. 

Mint Aspic Salad 

fl Add two cups of boiling water to one package of Mint Jiffy-Jell. When partially

which have been well drained, 1 cup of pecan meats, 1 cup of marshmallows cut in 
quarters. Serve with mayonnaise and creme-de-menthe cherries. 

Mint Apple Jelly 

<I When making apple jelly pour one pint of the jelly, just before it is ready to take from

Golden Rule Olive Oil 

<Q Golden Rule Olive Oil, one 'of the finest oils coming to 
this market at a price easily within the range of the 
consumer. 

][ MRS. ALLEN says : " Many say they ' do not like ' Olive Oil, 
and yet they have never tasted the perfect 'product. Golden 
Rule Olive Oil is the best that can be obtained, and because it is 
good, is heavy, clear, and of very delicate flavor. It is always 
fresh, and so digestible that it can be given to the smallest child. 
In fact, my sturdy year-old son ' licks the spoon ' when he has his 
daily ration of one teaspoon of Golden Rule Olive Oil, and his 
firm flesh and perfect digestion pay a tribute to this wonderful 
food." 

<J We can add nothing to this statement, except that we 
are sure your experience with Golden Rule Olive Oil 

will be the same as Mrs. Allen's. 

<J Olive Oil is becoming recognized more and more as the 
ideal food in many conditions, and the use of a pure, well- 
flavored oil is highly recommended. 



Golden-Rule M arshmallow Creme 

CJ This thoroughly useful preparation is a splendid aid in 
frostings, topping for chocolate, puddings, sauces, desserts, 
candy-making, etc. It is an ever-ready household help 
a splendid thing to have on hand in an emergency, as 
it may be made to take the place of eggs, cream, milk, 
sugar, and syrup; it is pure, delicious, appetizing, and 
economical. A trial can will convince anyone of its won- 
derful possibilities. 

<jf Highly recommended by Mrs. Allen as an aid in making 
both hot and cold cake frostings. Contains the whites 
of eggs, syrup, vegetable gums, and honey. Pure and 
wholesome.

Golden Rule Spices 

HP HE terms spices and condiments are applied to those 
< articles which, while possessing in themselves no nutri- 
tious principles, are added to food to make it more palat- 
able and to stimulate digestion. They are of exclusively 
vegetable origin, and occupy an important position in the 
diet qf the human race. 

<I Golden Rule Spices represent the finest spices grown. 
They are selected from the highest-grade goods from all 
over the world. They must not only pass our standard 
for natural aromatic properties, but must also pass our 
standard for quality of flavor. Every housewife knows that 
many spices are almost tasteless, lack pungency, and de- 
teriorate very rapidly. These conditions are due to the 
fact that the spices were poor and lacked quality at the 
time of picking. Spices are just like apples and are graded 
in exactly the same way, and to compare Golden Rule 
Spices with many others is like comparing a delicious, 
juicy Northern Spy apple with an ordinary Ben Davis. 
Both may be pure, but what a difference! 

<I Our Milling Department is one of the most complete 
and up-to-date in the country, and the man in charge of 
this department has had over thirty years' experience in 
spice milling. No inert spices, no exhausted spices, nor 
crude fiber strings are found in spices under the Golden 
Rule label. They represent all of the aromatic flavoring 
principles. 

<J Prof. LEWIS B. ALLYN, the famous Westfield pure-food 
expert, has said of Golden Rule goods: 

<I "After going rather deeply into the matter, we can state with 
pleasure that we have never examined a line of goods which rate 
as a whole, better than your Golden Rule Products. 

J " Those that we have examined were not only legally pure, but 
were, what is of almost equal importance of distinctly high grade. 
They rank sufficiently high to be given a place in our Pure Food 
Display. 

J"The term 'Golden Rule' is a good term to apply to these 
products." 

<J The high endorsement given by Prof. ALLYN is absolute 
proof of not only their purity, but their quality.

oratories direct to you. A postal will bring a salesman.
