PRACTICAL RECEIPTS 
BY EXPERT COOKS 



"To be a good cook means the knowledge of all fruits, herbs, balms and 
spices, and of all that is healing and sweet in tields and groves, savory in meats. 
It means carefulness, inventiveness, watchfulness, willingness, and readiness of 
appliance. It means the economy of your great-grandmother and the science of 
modern chemistry ; it means much tasting and no wasting ; it means English 
thoroughness, French art, and Arabian hospitality ; it means, in fine, that you 
are to be perfectly and always ladies (loaf-givers), and are to see that everybody 
has something nice to eat." — Ruskin.

FOREWORD 

AN excellent housewife once gave, as a part of her receipt 
for making gooseberry pie, the following direction : "Put 
in all the sugar your conscience allows; then shut your eyes 
and add a double handful." 

In compiling the present work the editor's conscience has 
been strained and her eyes have been closed in an opposite 
process. She had collected far more receipts than could pos- 
sibly appear in a single volume even of the generous size per- 
mitted by the plan of The Household Library. By various 
siftings, such as the elimination of obvious receipts, of alterna- 
tive ones, of those which would be infrequently used, of those 
requiring too costly materials for the average housewife, of 
rich dishes dangerously near the line of unhealthfulness, the 
material in hand was greatly reduced, yet not to the required 
dimensions. A Procrustean method had to be adopted. So 
the editor shut her eyes and took out not one handful, but a 
number of handfuls, of tried and approved receipts, each as 
good as the ones that remained, though no better than these. 
Therefore, if any reader finds that a favorite dish of hers is 
unrepresented in the work, let her blame the exigencies of 
publication rather than the intention of the editor. 

Under these circumstances space was considered too valu- 
able even for an index. So. as far as possible, the work was 
made self-indexing. Frequent chapters were formed to per- 
mit ready reference, and within each chapter the receipts were 

(")

arranged, first, according to logical and practical relation, and 
then alphabetically. For example, in the chapter on "Candies," 
the general receipt for "Fondant" is followed by special receipts 
in which fondant is an ingredient, these being arranged in 
alphabetical order. 

Thanks are due the Department of Domestic Science of 
Teachers' College, Columbia University, for the use of a 
photograph of the laboratory and of twelve photographs 
of uncooked meat.

FRUIT AND SHELLFISH COCKTAILS 

Banana and Pineapple— Cherry and Orange— Peach— Raspberry and Currant— Strawberry 

and Grapefruit — Strawberry and Orange — Clam — Oyster, Plain — Oyster 

with Sherry — Hot Oyster — Oysters in Grapefruit Baskets 

SINCE cocktails sometimes take the place of soup, a few 
of the fruit and shellfish variety are here introduced. 
They are especially fitted for warm weather, when hot soup 
is not agreeable to the palate. 

BANANA AND PINEAPPLE COCKTAIL 

Cut in thin round slices three ripe bananas. Add the 
juice and pulp of one grated pineapple, the juice of two 
oranges and one lemon. Sweeten to taste. Guard against 
getting the dish too sweet. Set to cool in the ice-box, and 
serve with a little shaved ice or a small piece of ice dropped 
in each glass. 

See also "Banana Salad" on page 150, and "Pineapple 
Salad" on page 157, which may be used for cocktails. 

CHERRY AND ORANGE COCKTAIL 

Cherries canned, with or without the pit, may be treated 
with orange-juice, sweetened and served as fruit cocktails. 
Canned strawberries, peaches, tamarinds, and other fruits 
may be served in the same way as cherries. 

PEACH COCKTAIL 

Peel and cut fine ripe peaches in small pieces. Make a 
strong lemonade by mixing lemon- juice with water which 



U THE HOME COOKBOOK 

has dissolved the sweetening. Lay a heaping tablespoon 
of the cut peaches in a lemonade glass, cover them with the 
strong lemonade, lay on a tablespoon of shaved ice and serve. 

RASPBERRY AND CURRANT COCKTAIL 

Lay a heaping tablespoon of red or black raspberries with 
a small piece of ice in the bottom of a lemonade glass. Cover 
with the juice of currants sweetened a little. To get the 
juice of the currants put them in an earthen bowl and then 
crush them with a pestle. Put the waste in a bag which has 
been wet and wrung and squeeze the juice through. 

STRAWBERRY AND GRAPEFRUIT COCKTAIL 

Cut the grapefruit in two, and with a spoon and fork dig 
out the pulp. Be careful not to take the inner skin with the 
pulp. Cut out the inner skin so that you will have the halves 
of the fruit in the shape of cups. Mix in equal proportions 
the pulp of the grapefruit and ripe strawberries. Sugar to 
your taste, keeping it rather sour, and set in a cool place till 
you are ready to serve it. Set the cup skins of the grape- 
fruit where they will be cool. When you serve, pile the 
cups with the mixed strawberries and pulp, lay in the centre 
a dessertspoon of ice. One grapefruit makes two portions. 

STRAWBERRY AND ORANGE COCKTAIL 

In a punch, lemonade, or other glass put half a dozen 
strawberries. Squeeze over them the juice of an orange. 
Add a dessertspoon of powdered sugar and the same quantity 
of ice, and serve. Each glass should be made separately. The 
strawberries and oranges may be prepared and set in a cool 
place till needed. Then add the sugar and ice. 

See also "Orange Salad" on page 156, which may be used 
as a cocktail. 

CLAM COCKTAIL 

Have twelve small clams opened and free from pieces of 
shell and from sand. Chill them on ice. Then add two 



FRUIT AND SHELLFISH COCKTAILS 15 

tablespoons of catsup, a teaspoon of horseradish, a teaspoon of 
minced onion, three shakes of Tabasco sauce, and a little 
lemon-juice or vinegar. This makes two portions, or cocktails. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL, PLAIN 

' In a wineglass put six small oysters and add a teaspoon 
of Worcestershire sauce, a dessertspoon of catsup, two drops 
of Tabasco sauce, and three or four drops of lemon-juice or 
vinegar. This is one portion, or cocktail. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL WITH SHERRY 

Be sure the glass is cold before beginning. Put in the 
glass six oysters, and over them a dash of salt, then pour one 
tablespoon of sherry over the oysters, measuring the wine 
carefully. Serve with two small, plain crackers. 

HOT OYSTER COCKTAIL 

Open a dozen medium-sized Blue Point oysters, and catch 
their liquor in an earthen saucepan or chafing-dish. Set the 
dish to heat, and as soon as the liquor begins to bubble take 
off the scum and mix in two tablespoons of minced celery, and 
add a little salt, a dash of red pepper, and two tablespoons of 
butter. When these ingredients are all hot and well blended 
slip in the oysters. Watch closely until their edges begin to 
curl, and then add a sherry glass of sherry. Stir well together 
and serve in hot soup plates. 

OYSTERS IN GRAPEFRUIT BASKETS 

Cut grapefruit so as to form a one-side handle basket. 
Scoop out the pulp and clip edge into points with scissors. 
Place eight small oysters in each basket and cover them with 
a sauce made of equal portions of lemon- juice, grated horse- 
radish, tomato catsup, and speck mustard. Place on shaved 
ice on plate and serve. [See illustration, Plate I.]

CROUTONS AND SOUP-BALLS 

A Soup Bouquet— Bread Fingers— Bread-and-Cheese Balls— Croutons— Curry Balls— Egg- 
Balls— Egg-and-Cheese Balls— Meat Balls— Winter Suet Balls 

A SOUP BOUQUET 

TO season soup with a soup bouquet, as it is called, which is 
another way of naming a bunch of sweet herbs, tie together 
with a white thread a small sprig of sage, a sprig of summer 
savory and thyme and parsley and a bay leaf. Drop the bunch 
into the soup you want flavored and let it cook in the soup 
for half an hour, if you have a moderate quantity of soup, 
and less time if you have less soup. The delicacy of the herbs 
is destroyed by long cooking, and by following that method 
you lose what you sought in making the bouquet. 

BREAD FINGERS FOR SOUP 

Cut off the crusts of stale slices of bread, cut the bread 
in fingers about four inches long and three-quarters of an 
inch wide, lay in a dripping-pan and toast a golden brown 
in a moderate oven. 

BREAD-AND-CHEESE BALLS FOR SOUP 

Mix half a cup of fine soft breadcrumbs with half a cup 
of soft American cheese and half a teaspoon of salt and a dash 
of cayenne. When thoroughly blended stir to a paste with an 
uncooked egg. Form into small balls, not larger than a 
hickory-nut, drop into boiling water and cook two minutes and 
then transfer to the soup. Or if you don't mind the balls 
coloring a clear soup, drop direct into the soup two minutes 
before serving. 



CROUTONS AND SOUP-BALLS 17 

CROUTONS FOR SOUP 

Take slices a third of an inch thick of stale bread, cut off 
the crusts, butter, and then cut in half-inch squares, or in 
pieces the size of a cent, or in triangles, diamonds, or other 
fancy shapes. Put in a dripping-pan in a moderate upper 
oven and toast a light brown. Put four or five in a plate of 
soup when serving. 

Another way to make them is to cut and then to fry a 
light brown in hot fat, or to put them in a frying-pan with a 
little butter and brown. 

CURRY BALLS FOR SOUP 
Mix half a cup of fine soft breadcrumbs with the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs, a teaspoon of curry powder and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Pound well together and then stir 
in a raw egg to form a paste and hold it together. Form into 
small balls not larger than a hickory-nut and drop into the 
boiling soup two minutes before serving. 

EGG BALLS FOR SOUP 

Boil five eggs till hard — that is, about twenty minutes — 
and then put them in cold water. Peel, and cut the whites 
in rings. Mash the yolks with the yolks of two raw eggs, 
beating the pulverized hard yolks well into the raw yolks. 
Add half a teaspoon of salt, a few drops of onion- juice, and a 
dash of cayenne. Form into small balls like marbles and 
drop into boiling soup two minutes before the soup is taken 
off the fire. Add also the rings made from the whites of the 
eggs. 

EGG-AND-CHEESE BALLS FOR SOUP 

Mash together the yolks of five hard-boiled eggs and two 
tablespoons of soft American cheese. Add half a tablespoon 
of salt and a pinch of cayenne. Blend these all together by 
mixing in the uncooked whites of two eggs. Form the paste 
into small balls and drop gently into boiling soup three minutes 
before serving. 



18 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

MEAT BALLS FOR SOUP 

Any cold cooked meat may be used for soup balls, but 
veal is preferred as being most delicate. To one cup of 
minced meat add half a cup of breadcrumbs, two tablespoons 
of minced parsley, a tablespoon of thyme or sweet marjoram, 
and salt and pepper to taste. An egg is to hold these ingre- 
dients together, and it should be beaten a little and used as a 
wetting, mixing in till the meat is moist and pasty. Form 
into balls the size of a hickory-nut, or a little larger, and 
lower gently in the soup and boil two minutes before taking 
the soup from the stove. *" 

WINTER SUET BALLS FOR SOUP 

Have half a cup of suet chopped fine and freed from 
skin. To this add half a teaspoon of salt, pepper as you 
wish, and half a cup of flour. Mix and add ice-water, a 
few drops at a time, while you stir. When you have a stiff 
paste, not wet and soggy, but merely sticking together, form 
in little balls like small marbles, drop in boiling soup and cook 
from five to seven minutes before serving.

ASPARAGUS SOUP J 

BOIL until tender in a quart and a quarter of water aspar- 
agus cut in pieces an inch in length and filling a quart 
measure and a quarter over. When the asparagus is cooked 
tender reserve a cup of it, putting the finest tips in the cup. 
Rub the remainder of the asparagus through a colander or sieve 
and put back in the water in which it boiled. Heat one pint 
of milk or, if you prefer it, cream, and pour over one table- 
spoon of butter and one tablespoon of flour, which have been 
well mixed together. Let come to boil, add the asparagus and 
its water, and the cup of asparagus tips. Boil up once more, 
salt, and serve with toasted bread cut in dice floating on top. 

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS 

Boil till tender in enough water to half cover it asparagus 
of the quantity called a "bunch." When done put the aspar- 
agus through a colander. Melt a heaping tablespoon of butter 
in a saucepan, adding gradually two heaping tablespoons of 
flour. When these are blended pour in slowly, stirring all the 
time, the hot water in which the asparagus was boiled. Let 



20 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

come to boil, stir in the asparagus pulp and then a pint of 
cream and half a pint of milk. Add salt and a dash of cayenne 
as it boils up, and serve with croutons. 

BEAN SOUP 

Soak a quart of small white beans overnight. Put them 
into two quarts of water to which you have added two tea- 
spoons of soda. Let them boil five minutes, by which time the 
outer skin of the beans is loosened. Pour off the water from 
the beans and rub them between the hands in cold water till 
the hard outer skins are off. Next put the beans in cold water, 
enough to cover and rise above them, and boil about three 
hours or till quite soft, adding water if necessary. Twenty 
minutes before serving stir in rich milk so that the beans 
break by the stirring and add the milk till you have the soup 
of the thickness you want. Put in salt and butter and pepper 
to taste. Boil up the soup a couple of times, and serve with 
croutons or sippets of bread. 

BLACK BEAN .SOUP 

Wash and soak overnight in cold water a pint of black 
curtle beans. Next morning drop the beans in a quart and a 
cup of boiling water, cover the saucepan tight and cook slowly 
two hours and a half or until the beans are tender. Put them 
through a sieve, add a quart of soup stock, a teaspoon of salt, 
and pepper to taste, set on the stove and bring to boil. Serve 
with a thin slice of lemon and a thin slice of hard-boiled egg 
in each plate. 

LIMA BEAN SOUP 

Soak a cup of dried Lima beans overnight. Next morning 
put the beans in two quarts of fresh water over the fire and 
cook until you can put them through a colander or sieve. 
Fry till brown two onions in two tablespoons of butter. When 
the onions are brown add two tablespoons of flour. Brown 
and thicken by the cooking of the flour. As it thickens add 
little by little a cup of the beans and water which you have 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 21 

put through the colander. Now put all together. Add a cup 
of cream, or more if you wish the soup thinner, boil up and 
serve with sippets. 

BEEF STEW WITH RICE 

Boil whatever sized piece of rump of beef you prefer. 
Cover with cold water, after placing in a soup kettle on top 
of the stove. Boil very slowly four hours. Skim when it 
boils. The second hour add salt to taste, and pepper very 
carefully. Scrape three carrots, wash them, and split down 
the centre. Add two onions cut in half. Boil until very 
tender. When done set in an earthen dish in a cold place to 
stand overnight. In the morning skim off all the fat. Take 
out the meat, rinse it off in the liquor, cut off all fat and gristle 
and throw aside, and cut the meat in large pieces. Save the 
carrot, but not the onion. Strain the soup in a large sauce- 
pan, add the meat and carrot, and, if liked, a little chopped 
parsley. Set on the stove and heat. Have ready hot boiled 
rice. Place one tablespoon of rice in the centre of a soup 
plate, on one side place a piece or two of meat, on the other 
a carrot. With a ladle pour over this some of the soup and 
serve hot. 

COMPANY BOUILLON 

Take half a shin of beef, a knuckle of veal, and a fowl, 
cover with cold water and set over the fire. Let come slowly 
to boil and then skim and set on the back part of the stove, 
where it will merely simmer all day. Be sure it is tightly 
covered. At evening pour it in an earthen jar, and the next 
day take off the fat and strain the soup through a colander. 
Chop fine two onions, a small carrot, or half a large one, two 
stalks of celery, and one tomato. Also mince a pound of lean 
beef, and with this mix the whites of three eggs and their 
shells. Mix the meat and vegetables and put to the soup. 
Set all on the stove and bring slowly to boil. Then set back 
where the heat will merely keep it at a simmer and let it stand 
till clear. This will not be in less than half an hour. Strain 



22 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

through a cheesecloth bag, add salt and a dash of cayenne or 
Worcestershire sauce. The bouillon may be set away to keep 
in a ;cool place. When time to use, heat very hot, and serve 
with seasoning given above, or give additional flavor by add- 
ing a cup of white California wine to six cups of the bouillon. 

VEGETABLE BOUILLON 

Take four pounds of juicy beef, a knuckle of veal, two 
small turnips, two carrots, one soup bouquet, a small pod of 
red peppers, and three white onions. Put the meat in cold 
water, to well cover it, and let it gradually come to boil. Then 
add the vegetables cut in small pieces. Do not let boil, but set 
on the back of the stove where the soup will bubble for six 





Vegetable Cutters 

hours, keeping always a tight cover and the steady, bubbling 
heat. Strain through a sieve into an earthen pot, and let stand 
all night to stiffen. Next day skim ofif the fat. Half an hour 
before dinner put in a kettle with the soup bouquet, salt, cook 
gently till serving-time. Lastly, add sherry to taste, or, if you 
wish, omit the wine. 

CARROT CREAM SOUP 

Slice and cook till soft in a large pint of water three 
medium-sized carrots. When soft put through a sieve and put 
them back in the water in which they were boiled, adding a 
quart of fresh milk. Bring to boil. Add three tablespoons 
of flour blended with three tablespoons of butter. Cook gently 
while the flour thickens, add salt and pepper to taste, and the 
juice of an onion if wished. Serve hot with small pieces of 
toasted bread. 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 23 

CREAM-OF-CARROT SOUP 

Wash and scrape a quart of young carrots, cut in pieces, 
put in enough hot water to cover and boil gently till tender. 
Reserve a cup of the diced carrots and put the rest through 
a colander or sieve. To a quart of the stock of chicken or 
veal add the pulp of the carrots and simmer half an hour. 
Smooth a couple of tablespoons of flour into a tablespoon of 
butter, add a little of the boiling soup, and stir all together in 
the soup till it thickens. Add a teaspoon of sugar, a cup of 
cream, salt and pepper to taste, and the cup of diced carrots 
which you set aside. The soup should now be as thick as thin 
cream. Serve hot. 

CELERY CREAM SOUP 

Cut celery in small pieces and boil till tender in enough 
water to cover. Keep it covered tight. When tender mash 
through a sieve or colander and put back into the water in 
which it cooked. Add the same quantity of fresh milk, and 
when all is hot, thicken, allowing a tablespoon of flour mixed 
with a tablespoon of butter to a pint of the liquid. Add also 
cream if greater richness is wished. Season with salt and 
pepper to taste and serve hot with bread sticks or sippets. 

CHEESE SOUP 

Mix two cups of milk with two cups of white stock, or 
white soup of chicken or veal. Mince fine a small onion and 
add. When the liquid is hot stir in a tablespoon of flour 
and a tablespoon of butter rubbed together smooth. After 
the flour cooks in and thickens the soup stir in half a cup of 
grated cheese, adding, to ensure against the curdling of the 
milk, a small pinch of soda just before the cheese. Lastly, 
and just as you take the kettle from the stove, stir in a 
well-beaten egg. Serve hot with little squares of toasted 
bread. 



24 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

CHESTNUT SOUP 

Chip off a piece from each shell to help the boiling an 
boil till tender large French chestnuts. Take off the shell 
and skins. Set a handful of the meats aside, and break an 
mash through a sieve the other meats. Have a cream mad 
by heating a quart of milk or cream and thickening with 
tablespoon of flour mixed smooth with a tablespoon of buttei 
Add the chestnuts you have put through the sieve till you hav 
the cream as thick as you wish it. Season to your taste wit 
salt and pepper, add the handful of chestnut meats, eac 
broken in two or three pieces, boil up and serve at once. 

CHICKEN BOUILLON 

Clean and disjoint a fowl. Cover with cold water, add on 
onion, one bay leaf, twelve peppercorns, and a handful c 
celery and parsley. When the meat is tender, strain, seaso 
the liquor with salt and paprika. Add a little boiled rice an 
the white part of the chicken cut into dice. Boil up and serv 
hot. 

CHICKEN BOUILLON WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Put a chicken or fowl weighing three or four pounds int 
a quart of cold water with a stalk of :celery, half an onioi 
and a sprig of parsley. Let the water come slowly to boil, an 




Chinese Puree Sieve 



then let it bubble and simmer for six or seven hours. Kee 
tightly covered all the time. Strain through a sieve into 
saucepan, season with salt and pepper and add the white c 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 25 

an egg beaten into half a cup of cold water. Set on the 
fire and after the soup has come to boil add a cup of cold 
water and bring again to boil. Strain through a wet flannel 
or cheesecloth bag and serve in bouillon cups, capping the 
bouillon with whipped cream. 

CHICKEN SOUP 

Take the carcass of a roast chicken, crack the bones and 
put them in a kettle with two quarts of water. Cover and 
boil gently or simmer for two hours. Tip into a colander or 
sieve to get out the bones. But the soup back in the kettle. 
It will be about a quart. Add a tablespoon of minced onion, 
a teaspoon of salt, a dash of pepper, and the dark meat of the 
chicken cut in small dice or cubes. Bring to boil and serve. 

CHICKEN GUMBO 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Use the carcass of a roast fowl ; chicken is commonly used, 
but turkey, duck, or pheasant may be used if convenient. 
Mince the meat thoroughly fine. Crack and boil the bones ; 
the liquor so obtained makes a good stock for the gumbo. 
Make one quart. Chop fine six slices of bacon and fry in the 
bottom of your soup pot. Add two tablespoons of sifted flour. 
When brown add one large chopped onion and one large, 
minced, sweet pepper. Next add your chicken, also quarter 
of a pound of minced raw veal. When all is well browned, 
add one teacup of canned tomatoes. Next put in the quart of 
chicken liquor, a pinch of thyme, one bay leaf, one cup of 
chopped celery leaves and tops, one small pod of red pepper, a 
pinch of rosemary, one clove of minced garlic, and one tea- 
spoon of chopped parsley; salt to taste. Boil up and then 
allow to simmer for an hour, that the veal may be thoroughly 
cooked. Before removing from the fire add a teaspoon 
of file. Serve with boiled rice, as in Oyster and Shrimp 
Gumbo. -, ,

26 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

CHICKEN GUMBO 

A ST. LOUIS RECEIPT 

Cut up one chicken, severing all the joints. Place it in a 
soup kettle on the back of the stove, and cook very slowly, 
adding one slice of pickled pork, about four inches long, and 
half a pound or a little more of fresh lean beef. Season highly 
with pepper and salt. Chop very fine one good-sized onion and 
one garlic seed. Mash together one heaping teaspoon of lard 
and one heaping teaspoon of flour. Add this to the onion and 
garlic and fry a nice brown. This done, pour over it one pint 
of hot water. Add one bunch of parsley, chopped fine. Cook 
slowly on the back of the stove one hour. One hour before 
dinner add the browned onion to the chicken and enough more 
hot water to stand about two inches above the chicken. Cook 
slowly. Have the chicken very tender. When ready to serve, 
take the kettle from the fire and stir in finely sifted file until 
it begins to rope, which you will discover by pouring it from 
a spoon. It is then ready to serve at once. Two handfuls of 
file are generally enough. Add more if needed. File is pul- 
verized sassafras leaves. If you have no file, okra is very good. 
By some it is preferred. In case of using okra, take either the 
dried or the fresh. Half a pint of the dried will be sufficient ; 
of the fresh, one pint. Slice it quite thin. Okra should be 
added long enough before the soup is done to cook it tender, 
which will be about half an hour. To serve have ready hot 
boiled rice. As each plate of soup is served place a tablespoon 
of rice in the centre. Ladle the chicken soup over it. 

CLAM CHOWDER 

Fry in a pot five slices of fat pork till the fat is half 
drawn out. Take out the pork and chop it, adding two good- 
sized onions. Slice three potatoes and have at hand a quart 
of clams. In the fat that remains in the pot from the fried 
pork put a layer of clams with a seasoning of red peppers. 
On the clams put a layer of pork and onions, and then a layer 
of potatoes. Next put in a layer of crackers broken up. 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 27 

Repeat these layers in order till you have used up clams, pork, 
onions, and potatoes. Cover with water and stew an hour. 
Add a little milk and boil up before serving. Thicken with 
a little flour if it is needed. 

CLAM SOUP 

Have three dozen clams. Wash, scrub, and rinse the 
shells. Put them in a kettle. Add three-fourths of a cup of 
water. Cover and heat. Boil till the clams open. Set off the 
fire and pick out the shells. Cut the hard part from the 
clams, tlirow it away, and put the soft parts in a bowl. Add 
three cups of milk to the liquor of the clams, and stir in a 
tablespoon of butter blended with a tablespoon of flour. When 
the flour has slightly thickened the soup, drop in the soft part 
of the clams. Boil up, add salt, and also a dash of cayenne 
if your taste wishes, and serve hot. 

CLEAR SOUP 

Take two pounds of lean beef, cut in pieces. as big as the 
end of your thumb, free it from all fat, and pour over it two 
quarts of cold water. Let it slowly come to boil, set it back 
to simmer a few minutes, and again let it come to boil. Cool 
and boil up once more. Each time skim thoroughly. Have 
scraped a small carrot and two small onions. Stick eight 
cloves in the onions, and with the icarrot drop in the soup. 
Let boil slowly, and add a teaspoon of celery seed, two blades 
of mace, and a few bits of parsley. When the onions are 
tender clear through, strain the soup through a bag. Put 
back in the kettle and stir in the well-beaten whites of two 
eggs. Boil until the eggs gather, stir in a teaspoon of burned 
sugar to give a delicate brown color, and strain till the soup 
is clear. Serve hot. 

CORN SOUP 

Chop fine one can of corn. Have one quart of milk cook- 
ing slowly and thickened with one tablespoon of flour stirred 



28 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

into two tablespoons of butter. Stir the chopped corn in the 
milk, boil up once, season to your taste with salt and pepper, 
and serve. 

CORN CREAM SOUP 

Take a large can of corn, empty the contents in the upper 
part of a double-boiler, mash with a pestle, and then add a 
quart of milk. Put hot water in the lower part of the double- 
boiler and set the corn to cook. While it is coming to boil 
mince two onions, add a heaping tablespoon of butter and fry 
in a saucepan with two tablespoons of flour. When the flour 
and onions are cooked, stir them into the hot corn and let the 
whole cook for ten minutes. Pour through a sieve, add salt 




Vegetable Sieve 

and a dash of cayenne, and just before taking from the fire 
stir in two well-beaten eggs mixed wdth a little cold milk or 
cream so that the eggs will not string or separate in the soup. 
Pour in a tureen in which are croutons or bits of fried bread, 
and serve at once. 

CORNED-BEEF SOUP 

Slice an onion into a quart of the liquor in which you have 
boiled corned-beef. Set it over the fire, and when it begins to 
boil drop in the still wet broken shell of an egg. Boil for a 
moment and pour through a sieve or coarse cloth strainer. 
Set the soup again on the fire, add a pint of milk, into which 
you have stirred and dissolved smooth two tablespoons of 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 29 

flour, boil a moment till the flour cooks, stir in a beaten Qgg 
and serve. 

EGG SOUP 

Heat the remains of a clear soup made from bones of 
beef or veal, poach an egg for every plate of soup you wish 
to serve, and when you serve the soup drop the poached eggs 
in the tureen ; or if you serve direct by plates lay the poached 
egg in the soup plate and ladle over it the hot soup. 

GUMBO AUX HERBES 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Chop fine six slices of bacon and fry. Add two tablespoons 
of flour. When browned add one large minced onion, and one 
pint of "herbes," which you have minced exceedingly fine. 
These herbs are one teacup of cold boiled spinach left over, the 
green tops of two onions, green tops of radishes and mustard, 
quarter of a teacup of minced celery, and half a teacup of 
cold kidney beans. Brown slightly, then add one tablespoon 
of canned tomatoes, half a teaspoon of thyme, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Add one quart of water or beef soup or 
chicken soup. Cook slowly half an hour. Serve with rice. 

INDIAN MEAL SOUP 

Have two quarts of boiling water in a saucepan. Mix 
eight tablespoons of Indian meal with a cup of cold water and 
stir into the boiling water. When the meal has swollen, put 
into a double-boiler and keep the outer dish full of boiling 
water for two or three hours. Stir now and then. Salt to 
taste, add a dash of pepper and a cup of cream, and serve with 
crisp fried croutons. 

JULIENNE SOUP 

Cut in small, long pieces a carrot, a turnip, a stalk of 
celery, two small leeks, a small white onion, and a white 
cabbage leaf. In a saucepan have a quart of boiling water 



30 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and cook the vegetables until done, that is about half an hour. 
Add a quart of beef broth or stock, and when all boils up, a 
teaspoon of sugar, a cup of cooked green peas or the tops of 
asparagus cut in small pieces, and just before the soup is 
served a few lettuce leaves or sorrel leaves cut in small 
threads. 

LOBSTER BISQUE 

Take one can of lobster. Cut the meat in small pieces, 
cover with one quart of water, and boil in a saucepan twenty 
minutes. In a separate saucepan put two quarts of milk. 
Mash together two tablespoons of butter and one tablespoon 
of flour. When the milk comes to boil, add the mixed flour 
and butter and one teacup of crackers rolled very fine. When 
the lobster is done add it to the thickened milk. Stir all 
together, season with red pepper, and salt to taste. Let boil 
just long enough to thicken. It is then ready to serve. 

MAIGRE SOUP 

Take whatever tops you have from a bunch of celery, cut 
in small pieces and put in a saucepan with a couple of onions 
and four good-sized potatoes, all sliced. Pour on two quarts 
of water, cover tight and boil for an hour. Stir and beat well 
together, add a piece of butter the size of an egg, salt to taste, 
and serve with toasted pieces of bread cut small. Cream may 
be added, and a thickening of flour may also be put in if 
wished. But as pure maigre soup it is made as above. 

MILK SOUP 

Heat a quart of milk in a saucepan over a slow fire. 
Dissolve and work smooth three tablespoons of flour in quar- 
ter of a cup of cold milk. Dip a little hot milk into the cup, 
stir about with the cold, and then add gradually to the hot 
milk. Stir while it thickens and add a teaspoon of salt. Add 
a couple of hard-boiled eggs coarsely chopped, drop in a few 
small pieces of butter, and serve hot. Bread sticks and young, 
tender onions go well with this soup. 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 81 

MOCK BISQUE 
Cook half a can of tomatoes soft enough to strain. If 
you are using fresh tomatoes take a cup and a half when 
cooked. In another saucepan cook one tablespoon of flour in 
one tablespoon of butter and stir in one quart of milk. Season

of soda. Lastly, add the strained tomatoes and serve at once. 

MOCK OYSTER SOUP 

Wash and scrape ten salsify roots, and as you work put 
them in cold water to keep the roots from turning black. 
When they are cleaned, cut in small pieces and cover with 
boiling water. Boil till tender, which will be in from thirty 
minutes to an hour. Put the salsify through a colander or 
sieve and return to the saucepan with three cups of milk, and 
the water in which the salsify cooked, which will be boiled 
away to about a cupful. Add a small onion minced, half a 
teaspoon of salt, and when the soup boils stir in a tablespoon 
and a half of flour blended with a tablespoon of butter. Serve 
after the soup thickens with the flour, adding a dash of icay- 
enne. 

OKRA CREAM SOUP 

Have a pint of okra cut in thin slices. Put it in a quart 
of salted water, boiling in a porcelain kettle, and cook till 
tender, nearly half an hour. Then add a quart of fresh milk,

ORKA GUMBO WITH CRABS OR HALIBUT 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

To a tablespoon of boiling beef dripping add quarter of a 
pound of minced boiled ham and two slices of minced raw 
bacon. When browned, add two tablespoons of sifted flour. 



32 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Brown well. Add two minced onions and brown. Add one 
dozen thinly sliced spears of okra and fry the whole until the 
okra begins to brown. Then add one teacup of canned tomato, 
one pinch of thyme, a dash of cayenne pepper, and one bay leaf. 
Brown all thoroughly. Add one pint of raw crab meat which 
you have picked from the shells. Leave the meat of the claws 
in the claws, put them in the gumbo, and add one quart of 
boiling water. Allow the soup to boil for half an hour, cook- 
ing the crab thoroughly. Add two minced cloves of garlic 
and one teaspoon of minced parsley. Serve with rice. 

The same rule serves for plain okra gumbo — leaving out 
the crab meat. Minced halibut makes a fine substitute for 
crab. The fish must be used raw. 

OKRA GUMBO 

Follow the directions for "Gumbo with Crabs," omitting 
the crab meat. 

ONION CREAM SOUP 
Slice a dozen small white onions and fry them brown in a 
tablespoon of butter or drippings. Add a quart of boiling 
water, icover tight, and let the onions cook half an hour. Then 
add a pint of fresh milk or cream, salt and pepper to taste, 
and thicken with three tablespoons of flour worked smooth 
in a little cold water. Put all through a sieve. If you have 
used milk and not cream, add three eggs well beaten into half 
a cup of cream. If you use thick cream instead of milk, add 
merely a cup of whipped cream. Boil up once and serve hot 
with bread sticks or with toast. 

OXTAIL SOUP 

Separate the tail at the joints and soak in cold water an 
hour. In three tablespoons of butter or drippings fry three 
small sliced onions. When the onions are brown drop in the 
beef pieces, first rolling them lightly in flour. When the meat 
fries brown add two quarts of cold water, cover tight, set 
over a slow fire, or on the back of the stove and cook slowly 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 33 

four hours. An hour before serving skim off the fat, add the 
seasoning your taste directs, whether of mixed herbs in a 
bouquet, or merely salt, and simmer, tightly covered, till 
needed. Serve with bread sticks or with sippets. 



OYSTER BOUILLON 

Drain from their own liquor and chop fine two dozen large 
oysters. Put them to heat slowly in a double-boiler. When 
they have become hot put through a sieve and press from 
them all their juice. The liquor you get under the sieve add 
to the liquor you get by first draining the oysters, :and set on 
the fire in an earthen saucepan. Stir in the beaten white of 
an egg and let come to boil. Then strain through a cheese- 
cloth bag, add salt and pepper, and the same quantity of hot 
creamy milk as you have oyster liquor. Serve hot with 
[Croutons or bread fingers. 

OYSTER GUMBO 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Have a deep soup pot very hot. Put in a large tablespoon 
of beef drippings and two tablespoons of flour. Stir con- 
stantly until brown. Add one large minced onion, a good 
pinch of thyme, and one good-sized minced sweet pepper 
without its seed. When these become quite brown add two 
tablespoons of canned tomatoes. Stir continually till the whole 
is well cooked, adding a little tomato- juice to keep from burn- 
ing. Add one quart of juice from which you have drained 
the oysters that go with the juice. Also one clove of minced 
garlic, one teaspoon of minced parsley, salt to taste, and 
a dash of cayenne pepper. Allow the soup to boil five minutes. 
Add the drained oysters, letting them boil three minutes. Last 
of all, while the soup boils add a teaspoon of file powder, 
stirring thoroughly. Remove at once from the fire, and serve 
with hot boiled rice, a tablespoon to each soup plate, and the 
soup poured over the rice. 



34 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

OYSTER STEW 

Take one quart of nice oysters. Pour them into a colander 
and set over a pan to drain. Look over the oysters to see 
that there are no shells with them. Put into a medium-sized 
granite preserving kettle one pint of milk and one pint and a 
quarter of water. To this add five soda crackers rolled very 
fine, one rather heaping teaspoon of salt, and a dash of pepper. 
Now add the liquor that was drained from the oysters. Set 
the kettle on the stove. Stir occasionally, and as soon 
as the milk boils up pour in the oysters, which will cool 
the milk. The moment it boils up again take at once 
from the fire, and set where it will keep hot without 
boiling. Add one tablespoon of butter and stir when melted. 
Let stand ten minutes before serving. The flavor improves 
by standing a short time. Have the soup plates hot, and 
break one soda cracker into each plate separately. Ladle the 
oysters over the crackers and serve. 

PEA-AND-POTATO SOUP 

Boil one pint of split peas till soft. Boil also till tender a 
pint and a half of sliced potatoes, together with one good- 
sized onion sliced thin. Put the soft peas and the tender pota- 
toes and onion through a colander, add water till you have the 
thickness you want your soup to be, salt to taste, boil up once 
more, stir in a piece of butter, and serve with Httle squares of 
toasted bread — sippets or croutons — floating in each plate. 

SPLIT PEA SOUP 

Soak overnight a cup of split peas. Next morning drain 
and put in a pot with two quarts of cold water. If you have 
bones of ham, fowl, or of beef or mutton, put them in to 
increase the tastiness of the soup. Cover tight, and cook 
slowly till the peas are soft, which will probably be in three 
hours. When soft put through a sieve. Add a pint or more 
of milk, and set over the fire again. Stir in a heaping table- 
spoon of butter and a heaping tablespoon of flour blended to- 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 85 

gather, add a tablespoon of salt and a dash of pepper, and also, 
if your taste allows it, a minced onion or onion-juice. If the 
soup seems too thick, thin with a little milk or cream. 

POT AU FEU 

THE NATIONAL DISH OF FRANCE 

The French cook this dish of theirs, which is so tasty and 
so nourishing, in an earthen pot or pipkin, a pot with a lid 
that fits close, cooks slowly, and does not hurry the meat. 
But with a good iron pot the care of the American housewife 
[can bring about as wholesome and tasty a dish. The pot must 
surely have a close-fitting cover to hold in the steam and the 
savor of the meat. And the fire must be slow — or the cooking 
must, must, must. 

This soup or stew is made afresh once or twice a week by 
every family in France who can afford to buy the meat for it. 
The families who can afford to live well eat it for its own 
merit; those who can not afford the most substantial foods 
every day take it in between their vegetable soups to keep up 
their strength and nourish the body in full force. It has been 
said that the temperance of Frenchmen is due to the delicious 
preparation of this dish by their wives. They eat at dinner of 
the nourishing pot au feu, followed by a vegetable salad or 
by fruit, and they have had a "square" meal. Their hunger 
is satisfied. A craving for something more does not lead them 
to a dram of whiskey, as has happened in unnumbered in- 
stances in our country. Men have sometimes become drunk- 
ards because their body is starved by poor cooking at home — 
their bodies crave substantial food, and they ignorantly stifle 
the craving with the poison of liquor. Let us have more of 
the French pot au feu. 

The French housewife begins to make this great dish of 
her people soon after breakfast on the day it is to be eaten. 
She puts the various things that go to make it gradually into 
the pot, attends to it throughout the day, keeps it simmering 
over a small fire, and when the good man comes in at night 
has it smoking hot, ready to dish in a hot bowl or deep platter. 



36 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

On the first day she commonly serves it with shces of bread 
soaked in it; on the second day with rice, vermicelH, maca- 
roni, etc. 

And one more word as to the French housewife's process 
of making before we give full directions. In the way she 
goes at it, a great French cook says, she shows the most 
truly scientific knowledge. She first lays the meat in her pot 
and pours cold water to it in the proportion of about two 
quarts of water to three pounds of beef. She then places it 
upon the fire, where it becomes slowly, very slowly, hot. In 
this slow heating the heat enlarges the fibre of the meat, dis- 
solves the albuminoids and gelatinoids which it contains, and 
diffuses the savory or extractive parts of the meat through the 
water. From this one fact of bringing to boil slowly and 
boiling in the gentlest manner, a tasty, nutritious dish is ob- 
tained. If, however, the housewife had heated the water 
quickly the albumen of the meat would have been coagulated, 
the fibres shrunk, the savory parts not diffused, and the result 
would have been tasteless broth and tough, hard meat. 
Housewives, do remember this difference between slow 
heating and boiling and quick heating and boiling of 
meats. 

But now as to what to put into the dish. Let us tell it 
in homely, English terms. Cut up six pounds of good fresh 
beef — the shin or the leg or the neck will do — and over it pour 
four quarts of water. Set over the fire, skim as it warms and 
simmers, and add half a pound of liver cut in small pieces, 
a teaspoon of salt, and a dash of black pepper. Slice or cut 
in cubes two or three large carrots and add. Next put in four 
turnips peeled and quartered, then eight small onions peeled 
and sliced, two of them roasted, or all fried brown. Next a 
parsnip, split and sliced, with the pith removed, half a dozen 
potatoes peeled and quartered, and a head of celery cut in 
small pieces. Add also a bunch of sweet herbs cut small. 
Now if you have not all these vegetables take what you 
have or can get. Tomatoes are always an addition. Let 
the whole boil slowly and steadily five or six hours. In fact, 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 37 

keep it just simmering, bubbling lazily. Serve as above 
indicated. 

In the directions given above the meat is cut up in pieces. 
This dish is also made with the beef cut in one large piece 
from the rump. When in one piece the beef is tied about with 
twine to keep it from boiling to pieces, but the making of the 
dish remains the same. Naturally you will then have a soup — 
it will not be so thick as with the meat cut in small pieces — 
and you will have a large piece of boiled beef, which you slice 
on a platter and serve with horseradish or any piquant sauce. 
If in making this dish you have beefsteak bones, chicken 
head or legs, add them, and their natural oils and flavors 
will increase the nourishing quality and tastiness of your 
dish. 

Instead of beef you may use mutton, venison, or buffalo. 

POTATO SOUP 

Boil in two quarts of water two small onions, four large 
or seven small potatoes, two or three stalks of celery cut in 
small pieces, and a sprig of thyme or parsley. When well 
cooked pass through a sieve and put back in the kettle. Mix 
smooth a tablespoon of flour and a piece of butter the size of 
an egg, stir up with a little of the hot soup and pour gradually 
into the soup. As it boils and thickens, season with salt and 
pepper to your taste. Lastly, stir in a cup or rhore of whipped 
cream and serve at once. 

RICE CREAM SOUP 

Wash and cook for ten minutes in a quart of boiling water 
half a cup of rice. Drain the rice, put it in a quart of milk 
in a double-boiler, cover tight and cook till soft, which will 
be in about twenty-five minutes. Fry two small onions in a 
tablespoon of butter. Put the rice and the onions through a 
sieve or colander, set them again to heat in the double-boiler, 
season to your taste with salt, cayenne, and celery seed, and 
serve hot with sippets.

THE HOME COOK BOOK 
SALMON SOUP 



Mix a tablespoon of butter and two tablespoons of flour 
and put in a saucepan to melt, adding also a teaspoon of salt, 
a dash of cayenne pepper and half a teaspoon of celery salt. 
Add this thickening to one quart of milk heated in a double- 




A Double-Boiler 

boiler. While all is slowly cooking together open a small can 
of salmon, mince the fish fine, free it from all bone and skin, 
and stir into the hot, thickened milk. Boil up and serve at 
once. 

SHRIMP GUMBO 

A LOUISIANA DISH 

Hull the raw shrimps. To one tablespoon of boiling 
beef dripping add two tablespoons of sifted flour. When 
browned, add one large minced onion and brown thor- 
oughly. Add one pint of raw shrimps. Brown, stirring 
constantly, taking care not to mash the shrimps. When 
half cooked, add two tablespoons of canned tomatoes, one 
clove of minced garlic, one bay leaf, a pinch of thyme, and 
summer savory, salt to taste, and a dash of cayenne pepper. 
Add one quart of beef tea, or water in which a chicken has 
been boiled. Water will do if you have not these. Boil until 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 3^ 

the shrimps are tender. Add a teaspoon of file powder before 
removing from the fire. Serve with plain boiled rice. 

SOUP STOCK 

Put a fifteen-cent neck bone and a ten-cent rose bone in 
a granite soup kettle. Pour over them six quarts of cold 
water. Stand the kettle on the back of the stove one hour. 
Then place it over a good fire. In about thirty minutes the 
scum will begin to rise and the water to steam. Now place 
over a moderate fire. Add one teacup of cold water and 
skim off all the scum. Cover the kettle closely, and set a weight 
on the cover. Let it simmer (not boil) four hours. Cut an 
onion in halves and stick twelve cloves in it. Slice another 
onion. Fry both a light brown in a little butter and add to the 
soup. Add one stalk of celery cut in pieces, three sprigs 
of parsley, two carrots cut in pieces, and one bay leaf. 
After adding these vegetables, let simmer one hour longer. 
Now strain the stock through a fine wire sieve. Add two 
tablespoons of salt, and stand in a ;cold place to cool. If kept 
in a warm place it will not make a nice jelly. When cold take 
off all the grease from the top. It is ready for use. Put it 
in a covered stone jar, and keep it in a cold place till used. 

FAST DAY TOMATO SOUP 

Slice three onions and fry them brown in their own juice 
in the bottom of the saucepan in which you make your soup. 
When the onions have fried pour over them a quart can of 
tomatoes well mashed, and a quart of boiling water. Cook 
all well together till the tomatoes are tender, then rub through 
a colander and put back in the saucepan. Add a cup of boiled 
rice, salt, and make of the thickness you wish with flour and 
butter worked smooth together, and in the proportion of one 
tablespoon of butter to one of flour. Simmer while the flour 
cooks, add a dash of pepper and serve hot with sippets fried 
in butter.

TURKEY SOUP. 

To use the remains of a turkey break up the carcass of the 
bird, keeping all the bones and skin, put in a pot and cover 
with cold water. Set on the back of the stove and let simmer 
for hours. Cover tight, but if the water boils low renew it. 
At night strain through a colander to get out the bones, and 
set to cool. Next day take ofif the hard fat on the top, put the 
jellied soup in a pot, stir in a cup of fresh milk when the soup 
is hot, and serve with a spoon of boiled rice. 

MEATLESS VEGETABLE SOUP 

Boil two tomatoes, two potatoes, one onion and one table- 
spoon of rice in one quart of water one hour. Season with 
salt, put through a sieve and serve hot with small rounds of 
toast. 

WHITE SOUP STOCK 

Take a shinbone of veal, weighing four pounds, and one 
small chicken. Add six quarts of cold water, one head of 
celery and two onions cut fine. Boil slowly four hours. Then 
add salt and pepper to taste, a piece of cinnamon and a piece 
of mace. After boiling strain ofif and allow to cool. This 
should make a solid jelly, and from it any kind of white 
soup or sauce can be made.

BAKED OYSTERS 

STIR over a moderate fire half a cup of butter and a cup of 
cream. Add a dash of cayenne, the grated yellow of 
a lemon-peel, and a few drops of Tabasco or old-fashioned 
pepper sauce. When the mixture simmers to the bub- 
bling point pour a third of it in the bottom of a baking 
dish, lay oysters in thickly, and sprinkle them with bread- 
crumbs and salt. Next pour in another third of the cream, 
and put in another thick layer of oysters with bread- 
crumbs and a little salt on top, and finally pour over your last 
third of the cream. Bake in a quick oven till thoroughly hot 
through and through. The cream on top will brown. 

CREAMED OYSTERS 
Heat two dozen oysters in their own liquor, seasoning 
with salt, cayenne, and also with white pepper, if liked. When 
the oysters fill out, strain. To this liquor add a cup of cream, 
and boil up and skim. Then stir in two tablespoons of 
butter creamed with two tablespoons of flour. As the cream 
thickens add a teaspoon of lemon-juice and the same quantity 
of celery salt. Lastly, put in the oysters which you have 
chopped. Let all boil up two minutes and serve. 

CURRIED OYSTERS 
Cook in their own juice a quart of oysters till their edges 
begin to curl. Then put in a tablespoon of butter blended with 



42 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

a tablespoon of flour, a teaspoon of curry powder, salt to taste, 
and a dash of cayenne. Stir all together and serve at once 
when the flour has cooked and thickened. 

DEVILED OYSTERS 
Drain ofif their juice and chop coarse a pint of oysters. 
Take a heaping tablespoon of butter, a heaping tablespoon of 
flour, the yolk of an egg, mix and add salt and cayenne pepper 
to taste, and three-fourths of a cup of milk. Stir in the pint 
of oysters and a tablespoon of lemon- juice. Drop upon little 
individual dishes or shells, sprinkle with cracker or bread- 




Small Dish and Shell 

crumbs which have been seasoned with melted butter, and 
bake fifteen minutes in a hot oven. For ease and expedition 
set your small dishes or shells in a large pan when ready to go 
to the oven. 

OYSTER FRICASSEE 

Put a quart of oysters in their own liquor over the fire and 
let come to boil. Tip in a strainer and drain off the juice. 
Put butter the size of an egg in a saucepan, add two table- 
spoons of flour, mix well, and then add the oyster- juice and a 
cup of cream ; also salt and cayenne to taste. Beat the yolks 
of two eggs and add a full teaspoon of lemon- juice. Stir this 
into the cream, set again on the fire, add the oysters, heat, but 
do not boil, and serve hot. 

FRIED OYSTERS 
Select large fine oysters. Pour into a colander and drain 
oflf the liquor. Take them out and lay each one separately on 
a towel. Lay another towel over, and press gently to dry the 



OYSTERS AND CLAMS 43 

oysters. Roll a quantity of soda crackers very fine and season 
carefully with salt and red pepper. Beat two or three eggs 
as needed, allowing to each egg one tablespoon of cold water. 
Dip each oyster separately, first into the egg, and then turn 
it over and over in the rolled cracker. Prepare all the oysters 
at one time in this way, and lay them on platters or plates. 
Have all ready before you begin to fry them. Put into a 
frying-pan (use two pans if you have many oysters to fry) 
half lard and half butter, only just enough to prevent the 
oysters from sticking. Have the fat hot. Put in only as many 
oysters as you can easily turn, and use both a knife and fork 
in turning them. When the oysters are a nice brown they 
are done. Take them out, and if you fry more oysters 
wash the frying-pan clean, and again put in fresh lard and 
butter. 

Oysters can be fried half an hour or hours before they 
are needed. Take the oysters from the frying-pan, lay them 
side by side (never one on top of another) in pans or on pie 
plates. Set them aside, resting one pan on the rim of another. 
Half an hour before serving set them in the oven and heat 
very hot. Serve on a hot dish. 

OYSTER JAMBOLAYA 

Proceed as for "Jambolaya," page 120, adding oysters in 
place of sausage or chicken. Use a little of the oyster- juice, 
but very little. The oysters must be drained very dry before 
adding. 

OYSTERS OR CLAMS A LA NEWBURG 

Oysters or clams may be prepared a la Newburg, fol- 
lowing the directions for lobster on page 50 and substituting 
either one you choose for the lobster. When you use clams 
take off the hard parts, chop fine, mix with the soft parts and 
use both together as )-ou use lobster meat. 

Turkey, chicken, and game, not forgetting sweetbread, 
may be treated as lobster and dressed a la Newburg.

OYSTER PIE 

Select good oysters. Put them in a colander to drain. 
Make a pie crust the same as for a fruit pie. Line a pie plate 
with a crust the same as for an ordinary sweet fruit pie. 
Season the oysters with salt and pepper before putting them 
on the pie plate. Mix through them, after they are on the 
pie plate (according to the size of the pie), eight or ten strips 
or more of the pastry, one inch long and a quarter of an inch 
wide, rolled thin. Cut in bits two teaspoons of butter and 
lay over the oysters. Cover with enough of the oyster liquor 
to moisten the oysters. Sprinkle flour over the top ; this, with 
the pastry pieces, will thicken the liquor. Roll a thick upper 
crust. Lay it double on the pie; turn the upper half over, 
and dip the knife in flour before trimming the edge of the 
pie. Cut open the centre with four strokes. Bake the pie 
until a light brown, and serve hot. [See illustration, Plate L] 

CLAM PIE 

Drain, and then cut in three pieces each clam of a quart 
of hardshell clams. Have at hand three good-sized boiled 
potatoes and two hard-boiled eggs. In a deep baking dish 
lay a plain pastry lining, and on the bottom put a layer of 
clams. Over the clams sprinkle powdered crackers and then 
put in a layer of slices of boiled potato and hard-boiled egg, 
salting and lightly dusting with pepper each layer. Alternate 
the layers till you have used your material. Lay on small 
pieces of butter. Add half a cup of clam- juice or water, put 
a pastry cover over the pie, cut holes in the centre for the 
escape of steam, and bake forty minutes to an hour in hot 
oven. 

PIGS IN BLANKETS 

Drain some large plump oysters, and salt and pepper them. 
Round each oyster wrap a thin slice of fat bacon, pinning 
the bacon with a wooden toothpick. Lay in a hot frying-pan 
and cook until the bacon is a crisp light brown. Lay upon 
small pieces of toasted white or graham bread and serve hot. 



OYSTERS AND CLAMS 45 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

In a baking dish put a layer of oysters, either medium- 
sized or large. Over them drop a few small pieces of butter, 
and also sprinkle pepper and salt. Lay on fine breadcrumbs, 
and on them pour a little of the oyster liquor. Next put in 
oysters as above directed and then breadcrumbs as above 
directed. So fill the dish, covering the upper layer of the bread 
with pieces of butter. Bake twenty minutes in a hot oven, 
and serve hot. 

TOASTED OYSTERS 

Drain the oysters you wish to toast. Heat their liquor 
in a saucepan. In another hot saucepan drop the oysters and 
move them about till they curl and plump. Have hot buttered 
toast on a hot plate or platter. Lay the oysters on the toast, 
and over each slice pour the hot oyster liquor, which you have 
seasoned to taste with salt, pepper, and butter. Serve at once. 

OYSTERS ON TOAST OR CANAPES 

Chop two dozen large oysters and mix with a heaping 
tablespoon of fine breadcrumbs. Melt a heaping tablespoon 
of butter in a saucepan, add a cup of cream, half a teaspoon 
of salt and a dash of cayenne, and when all is hot tip in the 
oysters and breadcrumbs. Have ready four or five slices of 
bread cut in circles, fingers, or triangles, and fried a golden 
brown. The bread must not be too thin, say quarter of an 
inch thick. Put the bread in a hot dish and pour over it the 
oyster mixture. 

CLAM TOAST 

Cut ofH the soft part of two dozen clams and simmer in 
only enough water to cover. When they have cooked thus 
twenty or thirty minutes, add a cup of milk into which you 
have stirred smooth a tablespoon of flour. Let this boil up 
and the flour thicken, and then stir in a beaten egg. Take 



46 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

from the fire, add a dash of cayenne, and pour over toast 
which you have just toasted hot and buttered. 

OYSTERS IN WHITE BLANKETS 

Use soft, finely-mashed potato and make thin cakes. Cover 
a cake with an oyster, or if one oyster is not large enough 
use more than one. Put over the oyster another cake of the 
same size, pinch together the edges of the cakes, lay in a hot 
pan well oiled with oil, butter, or sweet drippings, and bake 
till the potato is a light brown.

IT has been said that the first person who ate a lobster must 
have been either starving or exceedingly brave ; for there 
is but one other shellfish as forbidding in appearance as the 
lobster, and that is the crab. 

Within this uninviting exterior is a delicious white-and- 
pink flesh, the like of which can hardly be equaled. When 
broiled and served with hot butter sauce, seasoned with lemon- 
juice, and garnished with crisp greens, it is delicious. 

The lobster season extends from March to November. 
One can, of course, procure lobsters during all seasons, but, 
like oysters, they have their time, and out of season they are 
stringy and lack delicate flavor. 

SIGNS OF A GOOD LOBSTER 

Always reject a dead lobster; that is, do not buy an un- 
boiled lobster which is lifeless, as they are unwholesome. 
When buying ready-boiled lobsters their freshness can be de- 
termined by the tail, which should be curled tightly under 
and when drawn out spring quickly back into place. Unless 
it does this the lobster was boiled when dead and should be 
rejected. When buying a live lobster see that it is lively when 
touched. 

BOILING 

For boiling a lobster have a deep kettle with enough water 
to entirely cover the lobster. When the water becomes hot 



48 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

take the lobster by the back and put it in head first; cover 
tight. When the water boils put in one tablespoon of salt 
and boil steadily for thirty minutes. 

PREPARING 

When cooked and cooled, twist off the claws and legs ; 
break the tail apart from the body; remove the green sub- 
stance, which is the fat, and considered the tid-bit by epi- 
cures, and also the coral, the fine pink eggs. The stomach 
lies directly under the head and should be removed and 
thrown away; also the woolly gills. 

Now pick out all the small pieces of meat which lie under 
the gills. Crack the claws and remove the meat. Cut the 
legs open with a pair of scissors and remove the meat. With 
a pointed, sharp knife or scissors cut open the tail, inside ; re- 
move the meat in one piece; then open it and take out the 
one intestine which runs the entire length of the creature. 

The meat is now ready to be served in any way preferred. 

LOBSTER BAKED IN THE SHELL 

Cut the meat into small pieces. Have ready three hard- 
boiled eggs. In a saucepan place two tablespoons of butter. 
iWhen melted, stir in two heaping tablespoons of flour and 
continue stirring until well mixed. Now add one pint of hot 
milk and stir until thick and smooth. Remove from the fire, 
and add one teaspoon of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoon of 
paprika, one teaspoon of lemon- juice, the lobster meat, the 
eggs chopped very fine. Fill the shell. Cover with fine 
cracker-crumbs mixed with a little butter. Set in a hot oven 
to brown. Serve with half-sHces of lemon. [See illustration, 
Plate II.] 

LOBSTER SALAD IN TOMATO RING 

Cut the lobster in small cubes and to each cup add half 
a cup of crisp, tender celery cut in thin slices. Mix with a 
mayonnaise in which fold one cup of whipped cream. 



LOBSTERS, CRABS, SHRIMPS 49 

Boil the contents of a two-pound can of tomatoes with one 
bay leaf, twelve peppercorns, six sprigs of parsley, one onion, 
one teaspoon of celery salt, half a teaspoon of paprika for 
twenty minutes; then strain. Add to the liquid two table- 
spoons of gelatine, stir until dissolved, then turn into a ring 
mold. Set on ice to chill ; then dip into warm water for an 
instant, invert on a plate, and the firm jelly will slip out un- 
broken. Now heap the salad in the centre, and garnish with 
the legs and under part of large claws, surrounding with 
parsley or cress. [See illustration, Plate 11. ] 

LOBSTER CROQUETTES 

Prepare the white sauce as given in the directions above, 
seasoning with the pepper, salt, and lemon- juice, omitting the 
hard-boiled eggs, but adding one raw egg with the lobster 
meat. Spread on a shallow, buttered pan to cool. Then form 
into balls, a tablespoon of the mixture in each, by rolling 
between the palms. Coat with fine breadcrumbs, then dip 
into raw egg yolk seasoned with salt and pepper. Roll into 
very fine breadcrumbs again and drop into a kettle of deep, 
smoking-hot fat. When a delicate brown, remove and drain 
on unglazed paper. Place on a folded napkin, and garnish 
with watercress and the legs. [See illustration, Plate IIL] 

LOBSTER MELON 

Cook half a cup of milk and half a cup of breadcrumbs 

together. Add one and a half cups of lobster meat, chopped 

very fine ; one teaspoon of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoon of 

paprika, one tablespoon of sherry, the stiffly beaten whites 

of three eggs. Line a melon mold, well buttered, with this 

mixture. Cut the tails of two lobsters into small cubes; fill 

the cavity in the mold and pour into this one cup of the white 

sauce, to which add the yolks of two eggs and one whole egg 

well beaten. Stand the mold in warm water and bake until 

firm. Unmold, garnish with watercress or parsley, and place 

the lobster head in centre of top. [See illustration, Plate IIL]

60 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

LOBSTER CUTLETS 

For this dish canned lobster may be used. Open the can, 
at once tip out the contents, pouring away the Hquor. Chop 
the meat in small pieces. To the meat add an equal measure 
of breadcrumbs. Season with salt, lemon- juice, and cayenne, 
and moisten with milk until pasty enough to mold into 
cutlet form. Then dip the cutlets into a mixture of egg and 
breadcrumbs, and fry till a light brown in deep hot fat. Lay 
to drain for a moment upon brown paper and serve hot. 

DEVILED LOBSTER 

The foregoing receipt may be used for deviled lobster with 
the following variation in the cooking. When you have made 
the lobster ready for cooking, instead of forming it into cutlets 
lay it in individual dishes, put breadcrumbs upon it, pour 
melted butter over it, and bake in a quick oven until the bread- 
crimibs are a crisp brown. 

LOBSTER A LA NEWBURG 

Melt a tablespoon of butter in a saucepan or chafing-dish, 
and then stir in half a tablespoon of flour. After these are 
blended add gradually a cup of cream and see that it is well 
mixed in. When the cream is steaming and smooth stir in 
two pounds of lobster meat cut in small pieces, and when this 
is thoroughly heated through add a teaspoon of salt, quarter 
of a teaspoon of cayenne, and two tablespoons of sherry. 
Stir once more thoroughly, add the beaten yolks of two eggs, 
put in hot dish and serve immediately. 

BROILED SOFT-SHELL CRABS ON TOAST 

Choose crabs of good size, wash and clean them carefully. 
Then brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
lay over a hot fire on a broiler. Broil five minutes on one 
side, then turn and broil the other side five minutes. Have 
ready small pieces of white bread nicely browned and hot. 



LOBSTERS, CRABS, SHRIMPS 51 

Lay a ;crab on each piece of bread, and drop upon it a tea- 
spoon of maitre d'hotel sauce and a silce of lemon. Serve 
hot and at once, 

CREAMED SHRIMPS 

Mince a small onion and brown it in a saucepan with two 
tablespoons of butter. Stir in three tablespoons of cold 
boiled rice, three tablespoons of cream, and a cup of fresh or 
canned shrimps. Cook a minute, add a dash of tomato catsup 
and a tablespoon of tomato sauce, stir in and serve hot.

BUYING FISH 

THERE is no better lesson on how to choose fish than 
this: if it is possible in your own neighborhood, or while 
vacationing in summer, go to see a fishing boat empty its 
gleaming cargo on the wharf and make an individual study 
of that cargo. Learn to know the earmarks — not only those 
called St. Peter's on a haddock, but the signs of perfect fresh- 
ness on all fish. Do not be afraid of touching them ; fresh 
smelts have the fragrance of violets, and every fish has a 
wholesome smell. Turn them over, examine them closely. 
"An eye like a dead fish" refers to a fish which has lain for 
weeks in cold storage, not to one just from the water. It 
will have eyes as full and almost as clear as any living crea- 
ture. Notice the gills ; they will be beautifully red, the fins 
will be stiff, the scales shining, and the flesh so firm that it 
springs right back after the finger has been pressed into it. 
One can not expect, especially if one's home is some distance 
from the ocean or the great lakes, to find in market fish as 
superlatively fresh as when lifted straight from the net. Still, 
to be fit for human food they should not have lost much of 
their beauty. The signs to avoid are limp fins, dull eyes, pale, 
liver-colored gills, flesh in which you leave a dent by an im- 
pression of the finger, streaks of gray or yellow in the skin and 



FRESH FISH §3 

flesh, and the slightest symptom of a disagreeable odor. If 
you have to make the choice between salt pork and a fish of 
this description, choose salt pork ; it is infinitely more health- 
ful ; it does not contain a possibility of poisoning. When pur- 
chasing halibut or swordfish, where the head and fins have 
been removed, the test is pearly white or shining gray skin, 
firm flesh, and a good odor. It is an excellent rule never to 
buy fish which is out of season. If you want bluefish in Feb- 
ruary or shad in November, you can probably obtain it — a fish 
dealer will produce almost anything from his refrigerator at 
any time of the year — but you may rest assured it has known 
a repose of months in cold storage. If not really dangerous 
to eat, it will be flabby, it will go to pieces before it is cooked 
and be lacking in flavor. It is an excellent plan to post one's 
self thoroughly on the fish which is in season all the year round, 
and purchase that according to the month. A dealer will as- 
sure you that fish which has been packed in ice ten days is in 
as excellent condition as when fresh caught. I should say 
seven or eight days is the limit. After that time it will begin 
to lose its beautiful mother-of-pearl sheen. 

Although the old theory that fish is brain food has been 
exploded, the brain-worker will find what he most requires in 
a bountiful diet of fish. It is digestible food which is not over- 
stimulating or over-nutritive. Both the poet and the preacher 
will do better work on a dinner of broiled bluefish than on rare 
roast beef. Salmon, mackerel, and eels, which are exceed- 
ingly oily, are an exception to the digestible rule. They should 
be severely let alone by people of weak stomachs, while white- 
fish may be classed as the most digestible of all fish. 

The shimmering array on a market stall is alluring and 
confusing, and the fish dealer is apt to be persuasive. It is no 
economy to be inveigled into buying a five-pound bluefish 
when two pounds of halibut would have fed your family. Fish 
left over can be utilized nicely in many ways, as the following 
pages will show, but it is better not to have any; in summer, 
cold fish has not remarkable keeping qualities. Decide when 
you order a fish how you will cook it. The fish dealer can 



54 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

prepare it for planking or broiling better than you can. The 
cheapest fish is not always the most economical. Five pounds 
of cod will contain about two pounds of waste in the shape 
of skin, head, tail, and bone, while two pounds of halibut is 
solid fish with scarcely an ounce of waste. 

COOKING 

The cooking of fish depends very largely on taste, for va- 
rious methods apply frequently and most appetizingly to the 
same fish. Take halibut, for instance. It may be baked, 
broiled, fried or boiled, and be quite as delicious in one way 
as another. This rule is also true of cod, haddock, and nearly 
every kind of white-fleshed fish. What a cook or a fish dealer 
calls dark fish — this class contains bluefish, mackerel, herring, 
salmon, eels, and shad — are best suited for broiling, baking, 
or planking. They contain so much oil distributed through 
the flesh that it requires a dry, intense heat to make them 
palatable. Salmon is an exception to this rule, being at its best 
when boiled. An old saying declares, "Small fish should 
swim twice — once in water, once in oil." It is a good proverb 
for the cook to remember, because it applies well to every 
tiny fish. Smelts, brook trout, perch, whitebait, catfish, sun- 
fish, bullheads, and everything in small finny things, partly 
for the preservation of the small amount of meat on their 
bones, should be carefully stripped, cleaned, egged, crumbed, 
and fried. Sometimes these small fish are sauted, but they are 
not so good nor so wholesome as when they "swim in oil." 

BAKING 

When baking halibut pour milk over and around it before 
setting it in the oven. It keeps the fish moist, improves the 
flavor, and makes it brown more thoroughly. 

BOILING 

In boiling, if you have no fish kettle, improvise one. Line 
a wire basket with a cloth, allowing the linen to fall over the 



FRESH FISH 55 

edges ; put in the fish, coiling- it sHghtly if it is large, and drop 
the basket in the boihng water. This is an easier method for 
lifting it out whole than if set right in the kettle. 

In spite of careful watching, a fish will occasionally break 
in the boiling. Do not try to patch it together into an un- 
sightly heap of skin, bones, and meat. Flake it quickly and 
lay in good-sized portions on a large platter. Garnish with 
mashed potato, and over the fish pour a sauce. This trans- 
forms an almost hopeless failure into a most attractive dish. 

BROILING 

An oily fish, such as mackerel or bluefish, needs no enrich- 
ment of fat before broiling; a white-fleshed fish does. If it 
is cut in steaks, saturate it wath oil or melted butter and a 
good seasoning of pepper and salt, then put between the wires 
of the broiler. Lay the thickest end in the centre of the 
broiler over the hottest part of the fire, skin side up. Let it 
get perfectly crisp and brown on the flesh side before turning. 
Broil the skin side very carefully; it is apt to burn. Set it in 
a hot oven for five minutes to thoroughly finish the cooking. 

An iron fish sheet, with rings at each end for handles, may 
be made by any tinsmith for twenty-five cents. Grease it 
well before setting the fish to cook and lay under it strips of 
salt pork ; then set it in a baking-pan. You will find it very 
easy to slip a baked fish from this sheet on to a platter. 

PLANKING 

The fish which plank to perfection are shad, whitefish, 
mackerel, bluefish, red snapper, and pompano. There are a 
number of real advantages to this method of cooking; it is 
so easy, it may be done in any hot oven of a coal or gas stove ; 
the wood imparts a flavor to the fish which can be obtained 
in no other way. Then there is no difficult task of sliding it 
from a broiler or hake-pan to the platter, because it is the 
proper thing to send the plank straight to the table laid on 
a folded towel. If you have to prepare a fish yourself for 



56 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

planking, remember it must be cut down the back instead of 
down the stomach, the thin portion of the flesh going on the 
middle of the plank. 

ACCOMPANYING DISHES 
Fish of all sorts require the accompaniment of a starch 
food to make a well-balanced meal ; it may be bread, rice, 
potatoes or macaroni. 

TO BAKE FISH 
Free the fish from scales, and draw it from the gills. 
Wash it in a quick bath in cold water and lay it in an en- 
ameled baking-pan. For its stuffing see directions following. 




Bread Grater. (Also used for Corn, Cheese, and Cocoanut. ) 

Pour in enough boiling water to cover the bottom of the 
baking-pan, dust the fish with pepper, sprinkle with salt, lay 
on a tablespoon of butter, and bake in a quick oven. Baste 
often and keep hot water supplied to the baking-pan. For a 
large fish allow from one to two hours ; for small fish, from 
thirty minutes to an hour. When done push carefully from 
the pan to a hot platter, garnish with slices of lemon, and 
serve with drawn butter, white sauce, or some of the sauces 
found on pages 141 to 147. 



FRESH FISH 57 

BREAD FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED FISH 

Moisten breadcrumbs enough to fill and plump out th-e 
fish, and season with salt, pepper, butter, and minced onion. 
Add fat salt port chopped fine in the proportion of a heaping 
tablespoon of the chopped pork to one cup of breadcrumbs. 
Mix all together well, fill the inside of the fish, sew or tie the 
fish together, and bake as under directions for baked fish. 

POTATO FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED FISH 

Peel and boil a quart of potatoes. When cooked chop 
coarsely. Add three good-sized onions finely minced and 
browned in a tablespoon of butter. Add, if you have it, two 
tablespoons of minced parsley. Season with half a teaspoon 
of salt and a little pepper. Stir in quarter of a cup of butter 
when you have all the ingredients well mixed, and put inside 
your fish. If you have any stuffing left over, lay it in a corner 
of the pan in which the fish is bakedv 

VEAL STUFFING FOR BAKED FISH 

Mix a cup of finely chopped cooked v^eal and a cup of 
breadcrumbs, wet with water and squeeze dry. Add half 
as much finely chopped salt pork as you have veal. Mix 
all together, add the juice of half a lemon, salt and pepper to 
taste, and stir in a beaten egg. Stuff the fish, sew or tie it 
together, and bake according to directions for baked fish. 

BAKED FISH WITH OYSTER DRESSING 

A LOUISIANA RECEIPT 

Use a four-pound fish; any nice firm-meated fish, such as 
bluefish, redfish, whitefish, or red snapper, may be used. Fry 
one minced onion in a tablespoon of butter, add one teacup 
of cracker-crumbs, one teaspoon of salt, one minced garlic 
clove, one tablespoon of tomato- juice, a pinch of red pepper, 
and half a teaspoon of thyme. Brown and mix well. Add 
two dozen drained and chopped oysters. Brown until quite 



68 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

dry. With this stuff the body and head of the fish, sewing 
the sides of the fish together to keep the dressing in. Dust 
with flour and lay in the baking-pan. Lay some sHces of 
fresh tomatoes over the fish, also four thin sHces of bacon. 
Squeeze the juice of one lemon over, and also sprinkle over 
a little salt and cayenne pepper. Bake half an hour in a 
medium heat^ basting with tomato- juice. Serve with icrisp, 
white lettuce and mayonnaise or French dressing. 

TO BOIL FISH 

In getting a fish ready to cook, scale it, draw it, and souse 
it quickly in cold water. Have ready a kettle holding enough 
boiling water to cover the fish. Tie the fish in a square of 
cheesecloth to keep it from dropping apart, and slip into the 
boiling water. Allow twenty minutes of boiling for each 
pound when it is a cut from a large fish of the cod or halibut 
kind ; when the fish is small, or long and whole, allow about 
ten minutes. When the fish is nearly done add salt. Take 
it from the pot, slip it from the cheesecloth on a hot 
platter, and serve with some one of the fish sauces found on 
pages 141 to 147. 

In washing the cheesecloth in which the fish was cooked, 
do not use soap. Wash first in cool water and then in hot till 
perfectly clean. Dry, fold, and lay aside for next using. 

SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH 

Make a drawn butter of two heaping tablespoons of butter 
and two heaping tablespoons of flour, blended together. Put 
this in a small saucepan. Pour over it hot water to dissolve, 
add more warm water until you have one pint. Salt to taste. 
Set this in another saucepan with a small quantity of hot 
water in it. Stir constantly as the water underneath boils, and 
let it boil slowly. Raise it from the under saucepan now 
and then, and stir hard to prevent lumping. Return it to 
the water. Do this until the sauce is thick enough to pour 
easily. It must be perfectly smooth. Take it from the fire, 



FRESH FISH 59 

and add gradually the yolks of two beaten eggs, the juice of 
half a lemon, a teaspoon of onion- juice, and a tablespoon of 
chopped parsley. Serve hot. 

TO BROIL FISH 

Have your bluefish, trout, mackerel, shad, or whatever 
fish you have chosen well cleaned of scales, drawn and split 
down the back. Souse it for a second in clear cold water, 
have ready a hot broiler, rub the broiler with suet, and lay 
on the fish. Present first to the fire the flesh, or inside, of the 
fish, and when that is seared crisp so the juices will stay in, 
turn and sear the skin side. Now turn the fish from side to 
side frequently, and continue the broiling till done. Have 
ready a hot platter, salt the fish just before taking from the 
broiler, lay on the hot platter, spread on the fish a few pieces 
of butter, add thin slices of lemon and serve. 

PLANKED FISH 

Fish may be planked before a coal fire, but the broiling- 
oven of a gas stove is more excellent for this sort of cooking. 
First have your plank of hard, smooth wood. It must be of 
a size to go easily in your oven; the corners had best be 
rounded oflf smoothly. Make ready your succulent shad, or 
indeed whatever fish you choose, by scaling, drawing, split- 
ting down the back, and a quick, cold plunge, and upon the 
heated plank lay the fish. Its skin side must be against the 
board. Set under the broiler, and cook quickly for the first 
five minutes, more slowly afterward. As the broiling goes 
on, baste the fish with boiling hot water slightly salted. When 
it is done, which ought to be, unless it is very thick, in from 
twelve to seventeen minutes, draw the plank from the oven, 
set it on a hot platter or a napkin, spread v^ith butter, garnish 
with thin slices or quarters of lemon and parsley, and serve 
— the fish on the board and all on the platter or napkin. 

A word should be added about the care of the plank on 
which the fish is cooked. Do not wash it with soap. Scour 



60 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

it clean, wash it with boiling water, dry it perfectly, treat it 
carefully and keep it long, for an old board, that is one upon 
which fish have been planked, is better than a new one for 
cooking. 

SCALLOPED FISH 

Pick in small pieces two pounds of cold boiled fish. 
Make a cream by heating a pint of milk and mixing in quarter 
of a cup of flour and a scant teacup of butter. When the 
milk thickens season with salt, pepper, thyme, and chopped 
parsley, and if your taste directs also with a minced onion. 
Take at once from the fire, and as the ;cream cools stir in the 
beaten yolks of four eggs. Have a buttered baking dish, and 
put in a layer of the cream, then a layer of the fish, then of 
cream, and then of fish, so alternating till the top layer of 
cream is reached. On the top layer put grated cheese and 
breadcrumbs, and bake in a moderate oven about forty 
minutes. 

STEAMED FISH 

Have about a two-and-a-half-pound fish, cod or halibut, 
mashed very fine and raw. Season to your taste with salt, 
pepper, and onion- juice. Add three eggs beaten together, 
three tablespoons of flour, and milk enough to moisten. Put 
the fish in a mold and steam two hours. For a sauce to 
eat with this fish, follow the directions for a cream sauce. 
Season the sauce highly with cayenne, and add boiled lobster 
cut in small bits. 

CREAMED COD OR HALIBUT 

Take boiled cod or halibut left from another meal 
and kept cold. Pick it to pieces, and take out all the bones 
and skin. To the proportion of about half a pound of the 
fish take a tablespoon of butter and the same quantity of 
flour. In a saucepan over a moderate fire stir the butter 
and flour together, add half a [cup of milk and a pinch of salt, 
and when the whole boils up a dash of pepper. Stir in the 



FRESH FISH 61 

fish, heat slowly, and put in a hot dish, setting halves of 
hard-boiled eggs round the edge. 

CREAMED FROGS' LEGS 

Use the hind legs. Separate the legs at the joint. Drop 
in boiling salted water, and cook three minutes. Remove and 
simmer in enough milk to cover till the meat is thoroughly 
cooked and tender. Salt and pepper the milk to taste, and 
thicken with flour, adding enough butter or thick cream to 
give richness to the dish, in the proportion of a tablespoon 
of butter to four sets of legs. 

FRIED FROGS' LEGS 

Use only the hind legs. Drop them in salted boiling 
water, and let them boil three or four minutes. Drain and 
wipe dry. Have a plate of rolled cracker and a plate of eggs 
beaten a little. Dip the frogs' legs in the egg, then in the 
rolled cracker. Drop in boiling oil, lard, or butter, and fry a 
delicate brown. Serve hot. 

FRIED FILETS OF HALIBUT 

Choose for halibut to be fried a slice about one and a half 
inches thick. Cut into your filets, removing carefully the 
skin and bone. Wipe each piece with a bit of damp cheese- 
cloth and then dry. Sprinkle with pepper and salt and roll 
in flour. Dip in egg, then in crumbs, fry in deep fat and 
drain on brown paper. 

COURT BOUILLON 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Have one tablespoon of boiling drippings in a deep casse- 
role. In this brown one tablespoon of flour. Add one minced 
onion, two large boiled potatoes quartered, one teacup of 
canned tomatoes, a pinch of thyme, a teaspoon of minced

garlic, half a teaspoon of salt, and one minced red pepper- 
pod. Allow these to simmer, and add one pound of white 
halibut, sliced in steaks. Simmer half an hour. Add one 
teacup of hot water to thin the gravy a bit. When ready to 



Casserole 

serve, add one glass of claret. Serve, putting the fish on 
thin toast and pouring the gravy round. 

Halibut is mentioned, but any white-meated fish cut in 
slices may be used. 

KEGAREE 

Pick up cold fish, or one Lake Erie whitefish. Add the 
same quantity of cold boiled rice, two to four soft-boiled 
eggs, salt to taste, a dash of cayenne pepper and a dash of 
mustard. Mix well together, fry in butter, like an omelet, till 
a delicate brown, and serve on a hot platter. 

BAKED MACKEREL 

Have the fish cleaned and split, and head and tail cut 
ofif. Lay it flat in a dripping-pan which has been rubbed 
with drippings. Pour over the fish a cup of fresh milk, and 
then sprinkle it with salt, pepper, and a few small bits of 
butter. Bake in a hot oven about half an hour — judge ex- 
actly by its brown, flattened, "dull" appearance. Lay the 
fish on a hot platter and pour over it the hot milk in which 
it was cooked. 



FRESH FISH 63 

MACKEREL WITH VINEGAR 

A JEWISH DISH 

Cut off the heads and tails of the mackerel, clean and 
wash them. Lay in an earthen baking dish, adding whole 
pepper, cloves, allspice, and bay leaves to your taste in season- 
ing, and pouring over the fish equal quantities of water and 
vinegar almost to cover. Bake in a moderate oven till thor- 
oughly done, which will be in about an hour. 

FAST-DAY PIE 
Take what you have left of cold sole or haddock or cod- 
fish, take out all the bones, chop or cut in fine pieces, and 
pound the fish, with bits of butter strewed over it plentifully. 
Add and pound in a teaspoon of French mustard, a trifle of 
garlic, a raw onion, and a dash of vinegar. Put in an enamel 
pie or pudding dish, cover with mashed potato, and cook in 
a quick oven till the potato is browned over the top. 

CREAM FAST-DAY PIE 
For this pie you may boil the fish with salt or take what 
you have left of codfish, haddock, bass or any fish not too 
oily. Take out skin and bones, chop or cut the fish in small 
■pieces. Then set over to boil a pint of cream or very rich 
milk, and when this is hot stir in two small tablespoons of 
flour dissolved in milk, a grated onion, and a teaspoon of salt. 
Butter a deep enamel dish, and put in a layer of the diced 
fish, then one of the cream sauce. Alternate the layers of fish 
and cream sauce till you have used up your material, bring- 
ing the cream layer the topmost. Lay on a few grated bread- 
crumbs, dust pepper over the dish, and bake in a moderate 
oven for three-quarters of an hour. This pie may be made 
richer by adding bits of butter to the fish as the layers are 
put in the dish. 

BOILED RED SNAPPER 
Clean and scale a fresh red snapper that weighs five or 
six pounds. Wash it in cold water. Wrap it in a cloth and 



^ THE HOME COOK BOOK 

lay it in a fish boiler. Cover it with cold water, to which 
add one tablespoon of salt. When it comes to boil, set on a 
part of the stove where it will just bubble, and no more. 
Upon no account let the water boil. Simmer it in this way 
forty-five minutes. When done, take it carefully out of the 
cloth, and la}- it on a hot platter, and serve. To be eaten 
with sauce directed for boiled fish. 

FRIED ROE 

Wash the roe dry with a cloth, roll in corn meal, salt 
and pepper, and fry in hot fat till a light brown. Serve with 
slices of lemon. 

SALMON CROQUETTES 

Take a one-pound can of salmon, pick out all the bones, 
and strain the juice, and save it. Chop the salmon fine, and 
add one teacup of stale breadcrumbs, one beaten egg, and 
salt and red pepper to taste. Wet the salmon with the liquor, 
mix well, and have it just moist enough to make into oblong 
croquettes. Beat one egg, with one tablespoon of cold water. 
Roll crackers fine, and season with salt and red pepper. Dip 
the croquettes first in the egg and then in the crackers. Fry 
in a frying-pan, with just enough hot lard to keep them from 
sticking. If not needed at once, the croquettes can be warmed 
over by putting them in a covered pan in the oven. 

SALMON WITH WHITE SAUCE 

Take cold boiled salmon, or, if you use the canned salmon, 
slip it from its can and heat in a saucepan with its own oil. 
Make a white sauce like that described on page 147, season 
the sauce with lemon- juice, with pepper sauce, or with 
Worcestershire as your taste directs. Lay the hot salmon ort 
a hot platter, cover it with the white sauce, lay round the 
edge of the dish slices of hard-boiled eggs and sliced lemon, 
and serve.

COLD SALMON WITH VINEGAR 

Take one-pound can of salmon, pick out all the bones, 
strain off the liquor, and do not use it. Chop the salmon 
very fine, season with salt and red pepper, and add the yolk 
of one hard-boiled egg rubbed fine. Mix all together and 
beat with enough drawn butter to allow it to mold. Mold 
to shape in teacups. Set in a cold place to stiffen. When 
eating slice it across, beginning at the top, and eat with a 
little vinegar. This is very delicate. 

FRIED SMELTS 

Wash the smelts, split and clean them, and cut away fins 
and gills. Roll in a mixture of pepper, salt, and fine bread- 
crumbs, dip in oil and roll again in the breadcrumbs. Put 
the tail in the mouth and pin together with a wooden tooth- 
pick. Put a few at a time in the frying-basket, plunge into 




Frying-Basket 

hot fat, and fry till they are a crisp brown. When all are 
fried, put together in the frying-basket, plunge once more 
into the hot fat, and serve on a hot platter with lemon quar- 
ters and a tartare sauce. If you serve with the wooden 
skewers they must be small and out of sight. If they are 
large, draw them out. 



FRIED BROOK TROUT 

Clean, wipe quickly with cold water, and dry the trout. 
Split to the tail. Put salt, a dash of pepper, and a sprinkle of 
flour over them. In a frying-pan put salt pork cut in small 
pieces, or, if you have not pork, use equal quantities of butter 



(56 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and lard. When your pork fries out, and the fat is hot, take out 
the pork and put in the fish. Fry quickly a delicate brown, 
turning two or three times. Put on a very hot platter, lay 
on the crisp pieces of the pork, and send to the table still 
sizzling. With these delicate fish never serve any sauce or 
relish, for the same reason one can not add a perfume to the 
rose.

SOAKING SALT FISH 

DO NOT soak salt mackerel for next day's breakfast in 
warm water, or too long. By bad soaking the fish is 
sometimes spoiled, made flabby and tasteless, and voted a fail- 
ure, when if properly treated it would be appetizing. Use cold 
water, or, if milk is plenty with you, cold milk, and keep while 
soaking in a cool place. [See illustration, Plate IV.] 

BAKED SALT COD 

'Mix a cup of salt codfish picked up fine with twice its 
quantity of mashed potatoes. Add a pint of milk or cream, 
and then stir in two well-beaten eggs and half a cup of but- 
ter. Taste and see if the dish will not be salt enough with- 
out adding salt. Stir in a dash of cayenne, and put in a baking 
dish and bake half an hour in a moderate oven. 

CODFISH BALLS 

Codfish balls may be made in simpler fashion by using one 
cup of soft-boiled potatoes, mashed while hot and fresh into 
half a cup of shredded codfish. Fish and potato should be 
well mashed together, seasoned with a tablespoon of butter 
and a beaten egg, dropped into a pan or kettle of boiling 
hot lard and fried till a delicate brown. When lifted from 



68 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the fat they should drain a moment on brown paper and go 
to the table hot. 

A longer process for the making of the balls — and some 
claim a better one — is to soak a piece of salt codfish for seven 
or eight hours in cold water, changing the water once or 
twice. Then shred the fish, let it cook gently till tender, and 
put it through a sieve before adding it to hot potatoes. 

CREAMED SALT COD 

In the preparation for freshening the fish, proceed as di- 
rected in the receipt just before, or use the shredded cod bought 
at grocers'. For a cup of codfish take a pint of fresh milk, and 
heat in a saucepan over a moderate fire. When the milk be- 
comes hot stir in two tablespoons of flour wetted with half 
a cup of cold milk. Stir constantly, that the milk may not 
scorch, and cook till the flour thickens. Stir in two beaten 
eggs as you take the creamed fish from the fire. Pour on 
a hot platter, drop over it tiny lumps of butter, add a dash of 
pepper, and serve. 

DRAWN BUTTER SALT COD 

Cut three-quarters of a pound of nice w'hite codfish. Lay 
it overnight in cold water enough to cover it. If required 
for a late dinner, put it to soak in the morning. Pour 
off half the water and add more fresh water to cover it. 
Boil until tender, which will be about fifteen minutes. After 
boiling five minutes taste. If too salt, pour off all the water, 
add more, and finish boiling. When done, pick out all the 
bones, and chop fine. Boil and mash potatoes, have nothing 
with them but a little salt. Add to the chopped fish as much 
potato as you have fish, and half as much more when mixed 
together, season with red pepper, and salt to taste, making 
it slightly hot with the pepper, and enough salt to give it a 
salt fish flavor, though not too salt. To this add one beaten 
egg, and enough drawn butter to wet it up, rather stiff. 



SALT FISH 69 

Serve very hot with drawn butter, made as follows: Take 
two heaping tablespoons of butter and two heaping table- 
spoons of flour, and mash together in a small saucepan. 
Set in another saucepan which has a little water in it. Pour 
over the mixed butter enough warm water to dissolve it. Add 
more water to make three-quarters of a pint. Add salt to 
taste. Boil the water in the under saucepan slowly. Stir 
constantly to prevent lumping, and as it thickens now and 
then raise the upper saucepan from the water and stir hard 
that it may be perfectly smooth. When done, let it stand away 
from the fire, in the water, to keep hot — and cover to avoid 
a scum forming on top. Have two or three cold hard-boiled 
eggs. Slice and lay them on a separate small plate. When 
the fish is served to each person, put on the plate with it 
two slices of egg, and over the egg and fish pour drawn but- 
ter. Add also a sprinkle^of red pepper, if wished. This is 
a very nice and delicate way of preparing salt codfish. 

PICKED SALT COD 
Put into a crock, and cover with cold water, three-quarters 
of a pound of salt codfish. Soak this overnight. If wanted 
for a late meal put it to soak in the morning. At the end of 
the time pour off half the water and add enough more cold 
water to cover it. Boil five minutes, and taste. If too salt, 
pour off more water, and add fresh warm water to cover it. 
Taste again. The flavor should be that of salt fish, but not 
too salt. Boil until tender, which will be about fifteen min- 
utes. When done, pour off the water, pick out the bones, 
and break the fish into pieces little less in size than the bowl 
of a teaspoon. Place the fish in a granite saucepan and cover 
it with cold milk. Season with salt if necessary, and red 
pepper to taste. Having been salted, the fish will require little. 
Add one beaten egg, and one tablespoon and a half of flour 
dissolved in cold water. Stir all together. Set the saucepan 
in another saucepan with hot water in it. As the water boils 
the milk will gradually thicken. Stir constantly, and when it 
is creamy and moderately thick it is done. Add at this time 



70 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

two teaspoons of butter, and stir it through until melted. 
Move it from the hot part of the stove and leave it standing 
in the hot water to keep warm. Cover it until ready to serve. 

SALT CODFISH PIE 

Make a crust by sifting together four cups of flour, three 
heaping teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt. 
Mix in half a cup of drippings or lard, and add milk till you 
have a soft dough — it will probably take about a pint of milk. 
Roll out, and for the upper crust roll in a little butter. Line 
a deep baking dish with the crust. Freshen some picked-up 
codfish by pouring tepid water over it and letting it stand 
five minutes, then draining. Put on the baking dish bottom 
.crust a layer of the codfish, sprinkle with cracker or bread 
crumbs, lay next some bits of butter, and spread a cream 
sauce made by thickening a pint of boiling milk with two 
tablespoons of flour. Next break three or four uncooked 
eggs on the cream, salting and peppering the eggs. Make 
the next layer of the codfish, and proceed as directed in the 
layers till you have used your material and have a full dish. 
Lay on the top crust, slit its centre two or three times and 
bake the pie about three-quarters of an hour till the icrust is 
a delicate brown. 

TOASTED SALT COD 

Tear the fisb in thin strips and freshen by standing in 
tepid water five minutes. Press the strips on a cloth to dry 
them and then broil a light brown over a fire. Lay on a hot 
platter and spread each strip with butter. 

SALT COD WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Pick about half a poimd of salt cod in small pieces and 
freshen it by letting it stand five minutes in enough tepid wa- 
ter to cover it. Or take the shredded codfish bought in pack- 
ages and ready for use — although you may find it a little too 
salt without freshening by rinsing in cold water. Grate or 



SALT FISH 71 

chop an onion fine, add it to half a cup of melted butter and 
two tablespoons of flour. Brown onion, butter and flour to- 
gether, add pepper to your taste, and a cup of tomatoes cooked 
and beaten or put through a strainer till they form a smooth 
pulp. Cook together. Press the water from your cod, and 
when the sauce boils stir it in. Serve hot. 

BOILED FINNAN HADDIE 

In choosing the fish be sure its preservation is good. 
Not infrequently it may be found bad in some part. Wash 
and skin and lay in cold water enough to cover. Set over 
a fire, cover tight, and keep just to simmering point. In 
half to three-quarters of an hour the flesh can be raised free 
from bone — which is a sign the fish is done. Have a hot 
platter, lay the fish on it, spread it with butter and serve at 
once. 

BROILED SMOKED HERRING 

Let the herring lie in hot water for a quarter of an hour. 
Wipe, rub ofif the skin, lay on a broiler over a hot fire and 
broil, turning both sides to the fire. Lay on a hot platter 
and spread with butter or with maitre d 'hotel sauce, given 
on page 145. 

SALT MACKEREL WITH MILK SAUCE 

Wash the mackerel and soak overnight in cold water in 
a cold place. If you have plenty of milk cover the fish over- 
night with that for freshening. Next day rinse rapidly with 
cold water and put on its back in a dripping-pan. Pour over 
it fresh milk enough to rise to the upper surface as it lies in 
the pan, and bake half an hour in a good oven. About ten 
minutes before the fish is done mix together two even table- 
spoons of butter and two even tablespoons of flour. Stir this 
in the hot milk round the fish, and leave it to finish cooking. 
Lay the fish on a hot platter, stir the thickened milk thoroughly, 
add a dash of cayenne and pour over the fish. 



72 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BROILED SALT MACKEREL 

Follow the directions for soaking given in the foregoing 
receipt. Wipe the fish dry, brush it Hghtly with oHve oil, 
lay it on the broiler with skin side up first, then broil quickly. 
Lay on a hot platter, squeeze half a lemon over it, and send 
it to the table at once. A few sprigs of watercress or crisp 
red radishes go well with broiled mackerel.

ECONOMY IN MARKETING AND COOKING MEAT 

Best Time to Market— The Market Basket— Mutton— Soup Meat— Other Cheap Meats— 
The Cuts of Meat— Making the Most of Meats 

IN all parts of the country, whether in city, town, or village, 
every housewife who looks carefully to the matter of cur- 
rent expenses makes complaint that the rise in the price of 
meat adds a few dollars each month to her accounts. The 
meats which have gone up most alarmingly in cost are the 
staple roasts, stews, and broils of every creature, and if one 
must have these regularly the bills will necessarily be larger. 
Yet there is a possibility of setting very tempting dishes each 
day before your family with a quite infrequent appearance 
of roast beef, lamb chops, or porterhouse steak. When nicely 
cooked, the meats which appear as a substitute will be so well 
relished that the expensive cuts will not be missed. Besides 
knowing how to cook, the woman who would economize along 
this line must know how to market. It is not the marketing 
which can be done over the telephone, or by orders given to 
a clerk. There are exemplary butchers and exemplary clerks, 
I have no doubt ; but it pays, even if it cost ten cents carfare, 
to visit the market yourself. A study of the counters will be 
sure to reveal something good and cheap which would not 
have been thought of in the kitchen or at the telephone. 

BEST TIME TO MARKET 

Except in hot weather, marketing trips need not be made 

every day. With a good refrigerator or well-chilled store 

closet at hand, meat may be purchased . which will not only 

keep but prove better for being kept several days. In the 

depth of the winter market trips may be well arranged for 

4 Vol. 2 



74 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Except in large cities 
the markets of Monday are not altogether attractive ; they sug- 
gest that the careful vender is trying to dispose to the best ad- 
vantage of Saturday's left-overs. It is an excellent thing to 
market at the earliest hours of the morning. At that time 
there is the largest choice of meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables ; 
besides, you are apt to receive more attention than later in 
the forenoon when the place grows thronged. 

THE MARKET BASKET 

If you have good common-sense you will carry a market 
basket. I am not of so doubting a humor as one housewife 
I know, who markets accompanied by a rubber stamp, brand- 
ing her name upon a convenient part of all fish, flesh, or fowl 
she purchases. I feel sure, however, with a market basket 
on my arm, I am receiving what I have selected. This plan 
has another advantage : in summer you will not receive meat 
or fish slightly tainted from long exposure to the sun in a de- 
livery wagon, or in winter frozen almost to the very point of 
being spoiled. In the coldest weather if I can not carry home 
such tender vegetables as lettuce, cress, parsley, or celery I 
do not buy them. I have been taught this lesson by the ap- 
pearance of too many wilted, frost-bitten vegetables. There is 
a third good reason for the housewife's market basket. With 
her purchases carried straight home, there is no waiting for 
an erratic delivery wagon. I am not the only housewife who 
can tell of afternoons spent in watching for the butcher's 
wagon and the roast or leg of lamb for which a hot oven 
anxiously yawned. The dinner which followed was frequently 
made memorable by a makeshift dish of frizzled beef or ham 
and eggs! 

MUTTON 

When it comes to the subject of reasonable priced meats 
which provide nourishing and appetizing dishes they are many 
and of large variety. A leg of mutton might be placed in 
the front rank as a wise purchase for a large family. Where 



ECONOMY IN MARKETING AND COOKING 75 

. there are only two or three at the family table the mutton 
would grow tedious by virtue of its many visits. If it can be 
used, however, in a few meals it is excellent boiled very 
slowly and served with caper sauce. It also provides a pot 
of excellent stock, which, with barley and vegetables, makes 
a tureen of the best mutton broth. Usually a good leg of 
nuitton — remember, it is of mutton I am speaking, not lamb — 
can be purchased for ten or twelve cents a pound. 

Another good way to cook a rather tough leg of mutton 
is by braizing it. Brush the meat over with butter, sear it 
quickly over a hot fire, then put with three cups of boiling 
water in a closely covered soup pot. It should be well sea- 
soned with cloves and peppercorns, carrots, turnips, celery 
and onions cut in dice, also parsley and a bit of bay leaf. 
Fasten the lid on the soup pot with a thick paste of flour and 
water, and allow it to cook for five or six hours in an oven 
about at the temperature required for baked beans. Mutton 
prepared in this fashion is tender and delicious. 

SOUP MEAT 
There is a knack in knowing how to choose a good soup 
bone as well as in knowing how to cook it. It ought to be 
about two-thirds meat and one-third bone and fat. In the 
winter it is an excellent plan, provided you have a large 
enough soup kettle, to purchase two bones for soup — one the 
knuckle, which seldom costs over four or five cents a pound, 
the other a solid flesh piece, costing perhaps seven or eight 
cents. When the meat is cooked to the point where, if it were 
a stew, you would take it from the fire, lift out with a skim- 
mer on a large platter the meaty soup bone and cut away 
from it the nicest pieces of beef. You can often obtain two 
or three pounds of this meat, well seasoned and tendered by 
slozv cooking. Return the bone to the soup kettle and allow 
it to simmer until the bones drop apart. The meat which 
has been taken out may be utilized in a number of ways. It 
makes excellent hash. When well seasoned it is not to be de- 
spised in the shape of croquettes. With a cup of the stock 



76 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and a few parboiled vegetables you have a savory stew, or 
in hot weather it may be inclosed in an aspic jelly. When 
used in this way soup bones costing forty cents may be made 
to yield two or three meals of good variety for a large family. 

OTHER CHEAP MEATS 

Sheep's or a beef heart, with a good bread stuffing, is a 
cheap and very appetizing dish. Sheep's liver, which in Eng- 
land is esteemed as highly as kidneys, is almost given away 
in American markets. Try it larded and baked, then covered 
with a rich brown gravy, if you would know how good it can 
be made. Many cheap cuts of beef can be converted into ex- 
cellent meats by pot-roasting. Among them may be mentioned 
the lean, juicy cross-rib, or a solid piece from the lower part 
of round or face of the rump. Two pounds of flank, which 
costs from nine to ten cents a pound, make a very savory 
dish. The meat is rolled, sauted brown, highly seasoned, 
then braized slowly for two hours with just enough water 
to make a good gravy. The flank rolled makes a good soup, 
lifting the meat out when cooked and serving with vegetables 
and horseradish sauce. The stock left may be utilized next 
day as a rice or julienne soup. 

Remember when buying meat for a stew, braize or pot- 
roast, it is better economy to pay twelve cents a pound for 
solid, juicy meat than it would be to pay seven cents for a 
larger piece which is half bone and fat. It is the same economy 
that makes the good housewife choose a pound and a half 
of solid halibut at twenty cents a pound rather than a five- 
pound cod with skin, head and tail included at six cents a 
pound. 

Among the cheap and nourishing meats yet to mention 
one might include corned beef, with its cabbage accompani- 
ment, and boiled tongue, which in small towns and villages 
can be bought very cheap. The aitchbone sells generally at 
ten to twelve cents a pound and is the best bit of beef for a 
stew. Next to it come several pounds from the middle cut of 
the skin, the flank of a large sirloin roast or the upper part of 



ECONOMY; IN MARKETING AND COOKING 77 

the chuck rib. Good pieces of the round, which accumulate 
in small, unsightly portions on every butcher's counter, cost 
little and, by the aid of the household meat chopper, can be 
converted into Hamburg steak. I have something of a preju- 
dice against market Hamburg steak, preferring to see with 
my own eyes the meat which goes through the chopper. It costs 
less and adds a relish to sausage when it, too, is homemade. 

Odd pieces of pork can be had for the watching and at 
low cost in every market. For the people who like it, tripe 
provides an occasional good and cheap meal. Three or four 
pounds of lamb from the forequarter costs ten cents a pound, 
and is nutritious as a fricassee with brown gravy or as an 
Irish stew. Nothing makes a nicer stew or broth than a neck 
of mutton, one of the cheapest cuts of the sheep. Then in 
pork there is the old-fashioned, savory dish of spare ribs 
stuffed, while in veal rich stews may be made from the 
knuckle when cooked for a soup after the method suggested 
in the making of beef stock. 

THE CUTS OF MEAT 

The method of dividing up the carcasses of slaughtered 
animals varies considerably in different localities. The ac- 
companying diagrams illustrate the cuts generally made. On 
Plates V to X inclusive will be found illustrations of all the 
principal steaks and roasts of beef and lamb chops. 

MAKING THE MOST OF MEATS 

A famous chef once described tersely the slow, simmer- 
ing process required by a stew or soup. He said: "Never 
allow the water to laugh, let it smile — smile slightly." If 
every cook could be made to understand what "smiling" means, 
we would have cheap, tough meat appearing before us made 
so tender that it would scarcely require a sharpened knife. 
Instead of this we have expensive cuts which carve with the 
consistency of shoe leather simply because they have boiled 
at a broad grin.

THE HOME COOK BOOK 



If meats which have been boiled be left with the lid off, 
to cool in their own stock, they will be much more tender and 
juicy than if lifted from the boiling pot liquor to the platter. 

Corned beef is much improved by being cooked the day 




^jM/^(y^'l

before it is to be used. Let it cool oflf in its liquor, then 
cover, and when needed reheat slowly. Do not allow the 
liquor to boil, simply allow it to continue at the simmering 
point until the meat is heated through. 




Diagram of Cuts of Veal 



Do not pour the corned beef liquor away. Save it to keep 
the meat in until the last morsel has been used for hash. 
Corned beef cold which is kept in the liquor does not seem

like a piece of the same creature as when it is left to become 
dry and hard on an uncovered platter. 

A piece of corned beef, even when rolled, frequently pre- 
sents a ragged, unsightly appearance. Take a pair of sharp, 
clean scissors, such as ought to hang in every pantry, and

trim the meat into presentable shape. Set the trimmings 
away to be used as hash. 

When a smoked ham is about half used up, steam what 
is left on the smaller end. Wash, and soak it in cold water 
for an hour, then steam for five or six hours, setting the meat 
cut side down on a plate in the steamer. If it is to be served 
hot, the ham will be improved by browning it in the oven 
after steaming. 

A leg of mutton, when boiled, ought to cook rather quickly 




Diagram of Cuts of Mutton 

for ten or fifteen minutes, then set it where the liquor will 
scarcely bubble, until it is tender. An ordinary leg of mut- 
ton, about eight or ten pounds in weight, requires about two 
hours to simmer. 

If there is a scant amount of meat for a braize or stew, 
add a few cups of tiny potato balls about half an hour before 
taking from the oven. They improve the appearance of a 



80 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

dish and taste delicious. The shells of potato left over when 
the balls are cut may be put in cold water until required, then 
boiled and mashed. 

A brown gravy adds much. to the appetizing flavor of pork 
chops. Pour off the greater portion of the pork fat in the 
spider and put in two tablespoons of flour. Stir till quite 
brown, then add very slowly a cup and a half of boiling water. 
Season with salt and paprika and beat till creamy with a wire 
whisk. If not brown enough add a tablespoon of kitchen 
bouquet and strain over the chops. 

A steak which from its looks raises disturbing thoughts 
of toughness may, in the course of twenty-four hours, be 
changed to something of the texture of tenderloin. Mix four 
tablespoons of oil with two tablespoons of vinegar and pour 
over the steak, laid on a platter. See that the mixture wets 
every portion of the meat, then allow it to marinate in a very 
cold place. In the cold-storage room of great hotels one might 
(if admitted) find steaks which would be scarcely fit to chew 
marinating for days before they are required. They appear 
under all sorts of steak appellations and pass very easily with 
the uninitiated as tenderloin. 

Never broil the flank end of a sirloin steak; it is impos- 
sible to eat it as steak. Cut it off before the steak is cooked. 
It may be slowly simmered and make a nice little stew ; it can 
be boiled and used as hash or chopped raw for a breakfast 
Hamburg steak. 

When there are children in a household who care more for 
gravy than meat, as most children do, a few pounds of tough, 
juicy meat carefully cooked till tender will yield plenty of 
excellent gravy. With the gravy, baking-powder biscuit may 
frequently be served. It goes especially well with veal stew 
or a cream gravy, which may be had in abundance when stew- 
ing a somewhat tough old fowl. I always prefer biscuit to 
dumplings. It takes a very careful cook to make light dump- 
lings ; almost before a second helping they will grow cool and 
heavy. Besides, for cold dumplings one can find no possible 
use, while baking-powder biscuit is as good cold as hot.

TO MAKE AND USE ASPIC JELLY 

THIS jelly is a pretty setting out of meats and it requires 
little skill and costs but little. Lately it has had popular- 
ity. Soak half a box of gelatine in half a cup of cold water for 
half an hour. Take a pint of consomme or stock, or, if you 
do not have either, a teaspoon of beef extract in a pint of 
water. With this simmer a teaspoon of onion- juice, a bay 
or thyme leaf, and a stalk of celery while the gelatine is soak- 
ing. Add the gelatine, season with salt and pepper, and set 
away to cool if you wish to cut it in blocks and use it to 
garnish salad. If you wish to inclose in it pieces of chicken, 
turkey, beef, slices of tongue, or fish, pour the liquid jelly little 
by little about the meat until it is inclosed, giving time for 
each layer to harden. Keep the mold in the ice-box until 
ready to serve. Then dip the mold in warm water, cover it 
with the face of a platter, turn over, having the mold upside 
down, and the jelly will slip out. Parsley, lettuce, etc., may 
be inclosed with the meat. 

BROWNED FLOUR 
Put the flour to be browned into a pie pan or skillet. Set 
on the stove and as the flour begins to brown stir constantly 



82 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and brown evenly. Let it become a light brown. It is well 
to keep this browned flour in a small glass jar or covered 
tin can and have it ready for use. 

TO THICKEN A GRAVY WITH FLOUR 

Mix flour with water, making a smooth paste. Thin to 
the consistency of cream and be careful to have no lumps. 
While the gravy boils pour in this flour and water. Allow 
it to boil up a moment, and remove from the fire to serve. 

DUMPLINGS FOR MEATS 

Sift two teaspoons of baking powder and half a teaspoon 
of salt into two cups of flour. Wet with a ;cup of milk, 
stirring and beating lightly and quickly with a spoon. Do 
not put on a board or roll, but drop from the spoon in spoon- 
fuls into the boiling chicken or beef liquor. Put on the kettle 
cover at once, set a weight on it, and boil rapidly, if the dump- 
lings are small, twelve minutes. Lay on a hot dish and serve 
at once. Cold air makes the dumplings fall, therefore if you 
have to keep them a second for the meat, set them in the 
oven. 

CORN DUMPLINGS FOR MEATS 

Upon half a cup of corn meal pour a pint of boiling milk, 
stirring rapidly. Put in a double-boiler and let cook and 
thicken for half an hour. Then stir in half a teaspoon of 
salt, a teaspoon of baking powder, and two eggs. Form into 
small balls, using flour on the hands, and drop into your kettle 
of boiling beef, corned beef, or mutton ten minutes before 
taking off the fire. Skim out of the broth with a skimmer, 
and serve with the meat. 

The dumplings may be tied, with room for swelling, in 
small cloths, wetted, and floured. If you use the cloths you 
are sure none will dissolve in the meat liquor. Allow more 
time using the cloths, twenty minutes to half an hour. 



BEEF AND VEAL «3 

DUMPLINGS FOR BOILED RUMP OF BEEF 

Mix a heaping teaspoon of lard lightly through a pint and 
a half of sifted flour, using the ends of the fingers for mix- 
ing. Add an even teaspoon of salt, two heaping teaspoons of 
baking powder, a beaten egg, and two tablespoons of hot 
water. Beat thoroughly. Add more hot water, little by 
little, until you have the dough stiff enough to work into 
oblong pieces, dipping your spoon constantly into the flour 
and shaping with it. Drop the pieces in the hot liquor, cover 
close, and boil slowly fifteen minutes. Do not fork or turn. 
Serve the moment they are done, put in a hot dish to keep 
them from chill and falling. 

BRINE FOR CORNING BEEF 

When you have your beef ready for corning be sure it is 
perfectly cold and free from animal heat. It should lie pro- 
tected from flies or any attacking insect and become solid. 
Two full days of cool weather should be allowed for this. 

Have your corning firkin or barrel of clean, sweet, firm 
wood. Then have it perfectly scoured, and set upon logs so 
that air can pass between its bottom and the cemented floor 
of the cellar. Have also flat, square, scoured boards to put 
in over the meat to keep it from floating. Smooth, large, 
clean stones should be at hand for weights on the boards. 

In making the brine use a big kettle, or take the wash- 
boiler, scour it perfectly, and use that. 

Weigh out twenty pounds of coarse salt, two pounds of 
sugar (or two quarts of pure New Orleans molasses), and use 
half a pound of saltpetre. Measure fourteen gallons of 
water. Put all these ingredients into the kettle or boiler, set 
over the fire, and when the scum begins to rise begin to skim. 
By the time the brine boils you will have it clear. After it 
boils a few minutes set it from the fire to cool. 

Pack your beef in the barrel so that the brine may run 
easily between the pieces of meat, lay on top your boards 
and stones, and pour over the cold brine. 



84 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

If after a week or two a scum appears on the brine, take 
out the meat, scald the brine, and pack anew. 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF 

Corned beef is often spoiled through ignorance of the 
right way to cook it. In the first place it is well to note that 
small and moderate-sized pieces require about the same time 
for cooking. Wash off the brine from your piece, and into 
a kettle having enough boiling water to well cover it drop the 
beef. When the scum begins to rise, as the meat heats 
through, skim it off, and after the meat has begun to boil, 
move the kettle to the back part of the stove. Keep it gently 
boiling four or five hours — usually the longer time — and 
when the meat is done lift it into an earthen jar or wooden 
bowl, pour over its liquor, and let it grow cold. This treat- 
ment makes a great difference in the taste of cold corned beef. 
The beef that is taken from its liquor and allowed to grow 
cold in the air is apt to be dry and tasteless, when the same 
piece would be sweet and wholesome if kept in its liquor and 
allowed to absorb the juices its liquor contains. 

If the meat is to be pressed, it can be as easily pressed 
in its liquor, by laying a plate and weights upon it, as out of 
its liquor. 

If some of the corned beef is to be eaten hot, serve it hot 
and then place to cool the remainder in its liquor. 

An authority of to-day insists that by putting an un- 
peeled onion in the water in which corned beef is boiling, the 
meat is made more juicy and tender. 

CORNED BEEF HASH 

Chop cold corned beef quite fine, and chop, not so fine, 
potatoes cooked the day before, and therefore firm and cold. 
Take two pint cups of chopped meat and three and a half 
pint cups of chopped potatoes. Put them in a saucepan with 
enough hot water to show through the hash, add a piece of 
butter the size of an egg, also salt and pepper to taste, and 



BEEF AND VEAL 85 

cook gently, allowing the hash to brown upon the bottom 
of the iron saucepan and scraping up the browned hash to 
let other parts brown. When done add one slightly heaping 
teaspoon of mustard, which has been mixed rather thick with 
water, salt, and a little sugar. Serve very hot and quite dry. 

BEEF HASH 

Beef hash is not best made from cold roasts and other 
cold meats. To succeed you need to have a fresh round 
steak and prepare as follows: Cut off some of the fat, put 
into a hot iron frying-pan. When the fat has fried out take 
out the suet remnants and put the steak in the frying-pan. 
Season a very little with salt and pepper, and have enough 
fat to prevent the meat sticking to the pan. Turn the steak 
from side to side until done. Be careful not to let the juice 
burn. If there is too much juice the meat will not brown. 
Pour off the juice and save it to add to the chopped meat. 
Brown the steak lightly and cook just done. Take it from 
the fire, cut all gristle and fat off, and chop quite fine. Turn 
into a pan until you have chopped the potatoes, which should 
have been cooked tender the day before. To chop, they 
must be cold and firm. Chop the potatoes rather coarse. 
When ready set the frying-pan on a table. It is a mistake 
to prepare food over a heated stove. Take two pint cups of 
chopped meat, put into the frying-pan, add three pint cups 
and a half of chopped potatoes. Next three pint cups and a 
half of cold water — about enough water to be even with the 
chopped hash. Stir with a spoon. Next add carefully pep- 
per and salt. In seasoning you will find the taste does not 
come for a second. Wait a moment, and have just enough 
pepper to slightly sting the tongue and just enough salt to 
have a good flavor. Add to this a piece of butter one inch 
wide cut across a one pound roll of butter. Now set your 
frying-pan on the top of the stove, let it boil rather hard at 
first. This done for about ten minutes, set it back and cook 
steadily for one hour and a half, scraping up the hash with 



86 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the point of a large iron spoon to keep the meat from stick- 
ing or burning. Cook until rather dry, simply moist. To 
keep hot set an asbestos plate under it, and cover. Hash is 
good warmed over next day. Put it in a saucepan, if 
needed ; add a little warm water. Set this saucepan in an- 
other of hot water, cover, and heat. 

BAKED BEEF HASH 

Grease a pie plate with butter ; use the cold hash you 
have left over. Put it on the plate, and make it in a round 
shape with a spoon, and have it two or three inches high. 
Pour over this a very little melted butter, sprinkle a very 
little flour from a flour dredge, and brown in the oven. 
When brown, slip on a hot plate with the griddle turner. 

BEEF A LA MODE 

Take a round of beef and make a great many holes through 
it. Roll strips of raw salt pork in a seasoning made of half a 
teaspoon each of thyme, salt, pepper, and cloves. Then draw 



A Larding Needle 

these strips through the holes in the beef, or lard with a lard- 
ing needle. Put six onions, two tablespoons of milk, and one- 
quarter of a pound of butter in a saucepan. Stew the onions 
tender. Put beef, onions and all into a pot, with water just 
enough to cover them, and cook slowly five hours. Just 
before taking up, add a pint of claret if you choose, or omit 
the claret. 

TO BOIL FRESH TONGUE 

Follow the method given under "To Boil Corned Beef," 
with one exception — add three tablespoons of salt after the 
tongue has boiled an hour. 



.:'■ f BEEF AND VEAL -87 

TO BOIL PICKLED TONGUE 
Follow the directions for boiling corned beef. 

TO BOIL SMOKED TONGUE 

Use the receipt "To Boil a Ham" on page 119. Omit, 
however, the spice, sugar and thyme, and do not brown it in 
the oven. 

BOILED RUMP OF BEEF 

Take six pounds of fat beef rump, place in a pot, cover 
with cold water, and set over a moderate fire. When it 
boils skim, and then boil four hours very slowly. Do not 
add salt until it has boiled two hours. Boil very tender. 
When done, take up the meat, lay it in a colander and set it 
over a saucepan of hot water to keep it moist. Next strain 
all the liquor, take out two cups for gravy, and put in a sauce- 
pan. Dissolve two teaspoons of flour, stir smooth, and stir 
gradually into the gravy until it is thick as cream. If the 
flour lumps, strain through a strainer. Serve in a pitcher. If 
you want dumplings, make according to the receipt given on 
page 83. Put the liquor remaining after that used for the 
gravy in a large saucepan to boil the dumplings. If you 
have :cold meat left, set it away in the liquor in an earthen 
jar and it will not become hard. 

SPICED RUMP OF BEEF, INCLUDING SOUP 

Put six or seven pounds of the rump of beef into a flat- 
bottomed porcelain or granite kettle. Set on top of the stove. 
Povir over this just enough water to cover it. Let it slowly 
come to boil. Skim well. Scrape two large or four small 
carrots and split them down the centre. Add these and two 
large onions cut in half, and one red pepper. Tie up, in a 
small square piece of cloth, allspice, a few cloves, sweet mar- 
joram and thyme, and throw into the water. Boil very slowly 
four hours until tender. The second hour add salt to taste. 
When done, take out some of the liquor and make a gravy as 



88 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

thick as cream. Thicken with two teaspoons of flour dis- 
solved in cold water. If the flour lumps, strain through a wire 
strainer. Pour the liquor off into a stone crock, and set in a 
cold place. Next day skim off the grease. The liquor will 
have jellied. Take some of this, put into a saucepan set in 
another of hot water, and heat, and you have a delightful 
clear soup. Worcestershire sauce can be added. Serve with 
salt crackers, slightly heated. 

DAUBE 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Have three pounds of round of beef cut short and thick. 
Lard it with long thin pieces of fat pork, slipping in a thin 
sliver of garlic clove with each piece of pork. Peel and 
slice thin two white turnips, two white onions, and scrape 
and slice four carrots. Mix one tablespoon of salt with half 
a teaspoon of cayenne and two tablespoons of sugar. Rub 
the meat thoroughly with this. Place in a large yellow bowl 
a layer each of the sliced vegetables until half are used. 
Next place in the meat. Lay over this the remainder of the 
vegetables. Pour over this half a pint of cider vinegar and 
the remaining salt, pepper, and sugar. Cover with a cloth 
and plate, placing a weight on the plate. Let stand over 
night in a cold place. In the morning remove the meat from 
the liquor which has formed during the night, roll it in flour, 
brown it in a deep pot (a stone casserole is best) in which 
you have two tablespoons of boiling drippings. Add your 
vegetables, which you have strained and chopped fine, also 
half a pint of strained canned tomatoes. Add the juice of 
the meat from the bowl for gravy. If not enough to cover 
the meat add sufficient water to make it. Season with 
thyme, one pod of red pepper, one large bay leaf, the juice 
of half a lemon, a couple of allspice, and one or two cloves. 
Let come to boil, and then allow to simmer about six hours. 
Slow cooking is the secret of the success of this dish. If 
any be left over, put the meat in the centre of a mold, add 



BEEF AND VEAL 89 

some melted gelatine to the gravy, boil it up once or twice, 
pour over the meat, and set aside to jelly. You have a 
delicious mousse which is used with crisp white lettuce and 
mayonnaise dressing. Boiled rice is usually served with 
hot daube. Daube is a dish much used among Spanish 
Creoles in Louisiana and considered an economical one. 

ROPA VIEJA 

A SPANISH DISH COOKED IN LOUISIANA 

Boil two pounds of shin of beef, the liquor will do for 
soup stock. When the shin is cold cut off the best part of 
the meat in thin slices. Season with salt and red pepper, 
^ut the gristle and remaining meat in a separate dish. Slice 
and slightly fry two onions in a tablespoon of butter. Stir 
in two tablespoons of flour. When brown add one quart of 
tomatoes. To this add the remaining meat and gristle, 
which you have cut as fine as possible. Cook slowly for one 
hour. Add the sliced meat, also a dash of English mustard. 
Cook quarter of an hour longer. Just before dishing add a 
teaspoon of minced parsley, a little garlic, and one minced 
sweet pepper. Dish half for immediate use; put the rest 
in a mold to jelly. 

TO BROIL A BEEFSTEAK 

Choose a steak one inch thick at least, and better an inch 
and a half thick. The sirloin or tenderloin is the best. See 
that the steak is clean, and wipe it with a damp cloth. If you 
have a wood or coal fire let it be in the form of a bed of 
hot coals, and over it heat your broiler. When the broiler is 
hot rub it with a bit of suet and lay on it the steak. As soon 
as one side has seared over the glowing coals, turn and sear 
the other side. By this quick searing at first you keep the 
juices of the meat from flowing out and wasting. After this 
first quick searing turn the steak often till cooked. Do not 
dry up the steak; Allow about ten minutes for the cooking 
of a thick steak and less time if the steak is thinner. When 



90 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the steak is cooked sprinkle lightly with salt on each side, and 
lay on a hot platter. A few pieces of butter may be laid on 
it, or not, as the taste directs. 

Over a gas flame a beefsteak may be broiled in a hot iron 
saucepan. This is called a pan broil. Be sure your pan is 
hot, and then proceed as if over coals, first rubbing the pan 
with suet and then laying the steak in the pan. A complete 
gas stove has a broiling oven where the flame plays upon the 
meat, and proves an excellent broiler. Light the gas and 
heat the broiler before you rub it with suet, and put in the 
steak. Proceed then as directed for broiling over coals. 

CHOPPED STEWED BEEF 

Have two pounds of round steak. Heat a frying-pan, lay 
in it pieces of the fat of the steak and fry out the grease. 
Take out the fat, lay the steak in the frying-pan, pepper and 
salt a very little, and brown, turning from side to side until 
cooked a little rare. When done take out the meat, cut off 
the gristle and fat that is left, chop very fine, season with 
more pepper and salt, add a tablespoon of Worcestershire 
sauce, a tablespoon of tomato catsup, a dessertspoon of 
melted butter, and some sprigs of chopped parsley or a little 
chopped celery, or both. Cover with water, stew slowly and 
steadily for one hour and a half. A little more water can be 
added, if required. When the meat is done mix one tea- 
spoon of flour in cold water, smooth, stir it in the meat, and 
let boil a moment to thicken. If wished, half a teaspoon of 
onion-juice may be added. 

CHOPPED BEEF ON TOAST 

A SOUTHERN DISH 

Chop fine pieces of roast of beef, or steak, or veal, left 
over. To one tablespoon of boiling dripping add as much 
flour. When this is browned put in two minced onions. To 
this add the minced meat, adding also a good tablespoon of 
minced boiled ham. Then put in half a pint of cold mashed 



BEEF AND VEAL 91 

potato. Stir constantly. Moisten with canned tomato- juice 
to keep from burning. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, or 
summer savory. When it commences to brown on the bot- 
tom, stir in one egg. Serve on thin slices of toast. 

DEVILED SOUP MEAT 

A LOUISIANA RECEIPT 

Slice hot soup meat and lay it in a deep dish. To one 
pint of boiling milk add one minced onion, one minced garlic 
clove, one teaspoon of minced parsley, and cayenne pepper 
and salt to taste. Thicken with flour, and add one even 
tablespoon of French mustard. Pour this hot sauce over the 
soup meat. Sprinkle over all two minced cucumber pickles. 

MEAT FRITTERS 

Take one pint of cold meat minced or ground fine and 
two eggs. Mix together, add half a pint of water and one 
pint of flour into which a teaspoon of baking powder lias 
been sifted. Salt and pepper to taste, drop in deep fat, and 
fry to a golden brown. 

HAMBURG STEAK 

Qioose a pound of round beef, remove all gristle, etc., 
and chop very fine, or run through your meat chopper. Or 
have your butcher run it through his meat chopper when you 
buy. Mix in a little salt, a bit of minced onion or onion- 
juice if your taste so directs, and also a dash of pepper. Dip 
your hands in cold water, and then shape the meat cakes 
with your fingers. Lay the cakes in a hot iron saucepan and 
broil, searing them first, to keep the juice in, and later 
turning from side to side. Do not have a fire hot enough to 
burn. Serve hot with a tomato sauce. 

HAMBURG STEAK BALLS 

Mix into one pound of raw meat chopped very fine, red 
pepper and salt to taste, half a teaspoon of onion-juice, two 



92 THE HOME GOOK BOOK 

teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoon of tomato 
catsup, chopped parsley, and one teaspoon of melted butter. 
Make in round cakes, and fry in butter, lard, and a table- 
spoon of water, turning the balls over and over, cooking 
slowly until done and nicely browned. Pour the gravy over 
them and serve. 

HAMBURG STEAK BEEF LOAF 

Mix red pepper and salt to taste into two pounds of un- 
cooked round steak which has been chopped fine. Add one 



A Meat Chopper 

beaten egg, four rolled crackers, one tablespoon of melted 
butter, one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, two table- 
spoons of tomato catsup, one teaspoon of onion juice, half a 
green pepper chopped fine (if the green ones are out of 
season take a small red chilli pepper), two small :carrots 
chopped fine and boiled tender, several sprigs of chopped 
parsley. After mixing these in with the hands, make into an 
oblong loaf, lay in a baking-pan, and pour round some of the 
carrot water. Lay in several sprigs of parsley, a piece of 
green or red pepper, and several pieces of butter. After the 
meat begins to brown baste with the water every ten minutes 



BEEF AND VEAL 93 

until done. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderately 
hot oven. When cold take it out of the pan. To be eaten 
with tomato catsup, 

BEEF LOAF 
Put a pound of raw lean beef through a meat chopper, 
add and mix in half a teaspoon of salt, a minced onion, a 
dash of cayenne, thyme and sweet marjoram, half as much 
in cup measure of fine breadcrumbs as you have meat, and 
a beaten egg. Mix these together well, shape in a loaf, and 
bake half an hour, basting with hot water and melted butter 
in the proportion of a tablespoon of butter to four table- 
spoons of hot water, 

BEEF PIE 
Chop cold roast beef rather coarse. Put it in a sauce- 
pan. For a moderate-sized pie add two uncooked chopped 
onions, one cooked carrot chopped fine, several sprigs of 
parsley chopped fine, one tablespoon of Worcestershire 
sauce, two tablespoons of catsup, and salt and pepper to 
taste. Add any cold gravy you may have left from the 
beef. Put all together on the stove in a saucepan, cover 
with cold water, and cook three-quarters of an hour. If you 
have small quantity of gravy add a tablespoon of butter, for 
richness. Thicken with flour dissolved in water, let boil a 
little thick, set back, and it is ready for the pie. Make a pie 
or biscuit crust, roll a moderately thick piece, line a pudding 
dish, and pour into it the meat. Roll the upper crust half an 
inch thick, roll again, sprinkle with flour, and fold the four 
sides over. Roll again, and cut strips half an inch thick and 
the same in width. Lay each way over the pie like a lattice ; 
or, if you prefer it, make a whole cover of paste and cut 
several holes in the centre. Bake to a nice brown in a quick 
oven, 

BAKED MEAT PIE 

Cut pieces of cold meat the size of dice. Lay them in a 
baking or pudding dish, and add two or three chopped 



94 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

onions, pepper, salt, and a tablespoon of dry pulverized sage 
or some other tasteful garden herb. Take the gravy you 
have left of the meat or the remains of a soup, thicken with 
flour and pour over the meat, and then cover all with 
potatoes cut in thick slices. The potatoes may be half- 
boiled for the pie or cold boiled the day before. Bake for an 
hour in a moderate oven. 

MEAT-AND-POTATO PIE 

Mince cold meat, either boiled or roast beef or mutton ; 
season to taste with salt and pepper, add the gravy you have 
left, and lay in the bottom of a greased baking dish. Take 
mashed potato, either that left over or fresh made; mix 
thoroughly with -hot milk and a seasoning of butter, salt, 
and pepper, form into a crust to fit over the meat, spread 
on and bake in a well-heated oven till the potato has a crust 
of brown. 

POT ROAST 

Rib, sirloin, or rump can be used, as preferred. Have the 
beef bone taken out and the meat rolled, and skewered to hold 
it in shape. Put it into a round-bottom pot. Brown the beef 
first on one side and then on the other, then add one pint of 
boiling water and a piece of suet. Salt when the meat is half 
done. Cover very tight and cook very tender. Add no more 
water. When done pour out the liquor, and thicken with 
browned flour, a tablespoon, perhaps, or more stirred into the 
gravy, to which you may have to add some water. When 
thickened, strain and add a little pepper. 

ROAST BEEF 

The best pieces for roasting are the porterhouse, rib, and 
sirloin. Place the meat in a baking-pan on a wire frame 
which comes for that purpose, and sprinkle it lightly with 
peppers Have salted water in the bottom of the pan and an 
onion cut in half. Turn the meat two or three times while 



BEEF AND VEAL 95 

roasting, baste every ten minutes, in order to have the meat 
juicy, and allow fifteen minutes to every pound. Serve with 
gravy. 

ROAST BEEF GRAVY 
Brown some flour a light color, dissolve two tablespoons 
or more of the browned flour in cold water, stir smooth, and 
add to the gravy water used in basting. Boil slowly, stirring 




Dripping-Pan with Basting Ladle 

constantly until the gravy is slightly thick. If there be any 
lumps, strain through a strainer. It is then ready for use. 

ROAST BEEF STEW 
Slice cold roast beef in thin pieces. Cut oflf all the fat 
except a very little that may cling to the pieces. Slice, wash, 
and lay in an iron frying-pan four or five medium-sized 
onions cut in thin slices. Cover with enough water to boil 
tender. When done, put in the beef, add whatever cold gravy 
you have left from the roast beef. Add water enough to 
cover the meat. Pepper and salt carefully to taste, add one 
tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and three of tomato cat- 
sup. Let this boil slowly one hour, then thicken it with flour 
dissolved in cold water stirred very smooth. Pour into the 
middle of the stew some of the mixed flour. Stir very 
quickly with the back of a large spoon to prevent lumping. 
Boil up and serve hot. 

SCALLOPED BEEF 
Meat for scalloping may be either minced or cut in small 
slices. Put a layer in a greased baking dish and season it 



96 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

to your taste with salt and pepper, adding minced onion if 
you wish and covering the layer with gravy. Next strew 
fine breadcrumbs and lay over them small bits of butter, and 
sprinkle grated cheese. If you have material repeat the 
layers. Bake in a hot oven till the top layer of breadcrumbs 
is brown, and serve with a tomato sauce, with pickles or 
with horseradish. 

TO COOK SMOKED BEEF 

Have the smoked beef cut very thin. Put the quantity 
needed in a granite frying-pan. Cover with cold water. As 
soon as it comes to boil, pour off the water. Cover with 
milk, add a little salt and a very little pepper. Taste for 
seasoning. Have ready flour and water mixed smooth, 
allowing a tablespoon of flour to a cup of milk. Pour gradu- 
ally into the middle of the hot milk. Stir well with the back 
of the spoon at first, and stir again to mix. Let boil slowly, 
stirring constantly until the milk thickens. When thick 
enough take off the fire and add a tablespoon of butter. 
Serve in a hot dish. 

CREAMED DRIED BEEF 

Have half a pound of dried beef sliced thin. Break it in 
small bits. Let it stand five minutes in cold water which is 
gradually growing lukewarm, then drain. Put it in a sauce- 
pan and add a pint of milk. As the milk heats add slowly two 
large spoons of flour dissolved in half a cup of cold water. 
Cook till the milk thickens. Take from the fire, stir in a 
beaten tgg, tip on a hot platter, drop small pieces of butter 
over the whole, sprinkle with pepper, and serve hot. 

STEWED BEEF OR VEAL TONGUE 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Use one large fresh beef tongue or two or three veal 
tongues. Boil the tongue half an hour. Strain the water 



BEEF AND VEAL 97 

for gravy. Remove the skin and gristle from the tongue, 
leaving any pieces of sweetbread which may be attached. 
Roll the tongue in flour and brown it in a deep saucepan or 
casserole in which }0u have two tablespoons of boiling drip- 
pings. Add two teacups of canned tomatoes, one minced 
onion, three sliced carrots, four sliced potatoes, and six small 
white onions. Fill the casserole with the strained water, add 
one bay leaf, a pinch of thyme, one red pepper pod, and half 
a teaspoon of salt. Allow to simmer three hours. Serve 
with the vegetables placed around the tongues, and the gravy 
in a separate dish. 

The dish may be varied by the addition of a teaspoon of 
mustard mixed into the gravy. 

VEAL CUTLETS 

Have the cutlets cut a little more than half an inch thick. 
Roll soda crackers very fine. Beat one egg or more. To 
one egg add a tablespoon of cold water. Lay the rolled 
cracker on a pie plate, the egg in a smaller pan. Season the 
cracker highly with salt to taste, and red pepper. Cut the 
veal in pieces ready to serve. Dip each piece first in the egg 
and then roll over and over in the cracker. Put in a frying- 
pan a number of pieces of pickled pork cut in thin slices. 
Fry out the fat, and brown on both sides. When brown take 
out, and lay on a hot platter. Now put the veal in the fat 
and add a large lump of butter. Cook very slowly, turn as 
it browns lightly, and do not allow it to brown enough to be 
hard. Cook until well done. If more fat is needed, add 
butter and a little lard. When done lay the pieces of veal 
on the hot platter, and pour the fat over it, without any 
thickening at all. 

VEAL FILET 

Have your butcher take out the bone and make a deep cut, 
or you can do it yourself. Fill the cut with dressing made 

as follows: Two cups of breadcrumbs, one-half cup of 

5 Vol. 2

THE HOME COOK BOOK 



chopped pork, a little lemon peel grated, the juice of a 
lemon, and pepper, salt, onions, and sage to taste, wetting all 
with cold water. Then bend the veal into a round form, 
fasten with skewers, sprinkle over salt and pepper and set 
in a well-heated oven for a two to three hours' roast. Baste 
well and often with butter and water. Just before it is done, 
sprinkle over a little flour and baste again. When done, add 
to the gravy a little thickening and some lemon- juice, if liked. 




Skewers tor Meat and Poultry 



Strain the gravy, remove the grease that rises to the top, and 
serve in a gravy dish. 

Broiled or boiled ham cut in small pieces serves well with 
this meat. 

GRILLARD OF VEAL 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Cut in pieces like cutlets and beat two pounds of round 
steaks of veal. Lay in a deep china plate and pour over one 
tablespoon of cider vinegar, a teaspoon of salt and black 
pepper mixed in the vinegar. Have a deep saucepan or 
skillet very hot, and put in one large tablespoon of drippings. 
When this is smoking hot, throw in the cutlets, and be 
careful to make them lie flat. Cook quickly. When browned 



^BEEF AND VEAL 99 

take the cutlets from the skillet. To the hot drippings add 
an even tablespoon of sifted flour. When brown add one 
small minced onion, and to the browned flour and onion 
return your cutlets, adding one teacup of strained canned 
tomato, a pinch of summer savory, a little minced garlic, 
and salt and pepper to taste. Cook very slowly for half an 
hour. Serve the cutlets on slices of thin toast; pour gravy 
over all. 

VEAL LOAF 

Take a pound weight of cold pieces of veal — it matters 
not if the meat is coarse — and mince as fine as possible. 
Take also the last shavings of a boiled ham or fat part of 
the ham, and chop small. Mix the ham and veal well to- 
gether, add half a cup of grated breadcrumbs, the juice of 
half a lemon, and half a cup of the thick gravy of the veal. 
Add also a little salt and cayenne to taste, and a dust of 
powdered mace. Mix thoroughly again, and press into a 
mold or bowl upon which you can set a weight. Keep cool, 
and serve next day after you have tipped the meat from the 
mold. 

If you wish to serve the veal loaf hot and at once, do as 
follows : After you have mixed the ingredients thoroughly, 
make the meat in the form of a loaf, strew bread or cracker 
crumbs over it, and heat it through thoroughly in a slow 
oven. Send the loaf to the table in a deep dish, and after 
you have poured round it gravy left from the first cooking 
of the veal. 

VEAL PATTIES 

Chop fine some scraps of cold roast veal — the remains of 
a fillet are often convenient — and add, chopping with it, bits 
of cold ham or cold smoked tongue. Add also yolks of 
hard-boiled eggs, the two or three of which you have used 
the whites for some other cooking. Season with salt, a little 
pepper, and moisten a little with the cold gravy of the veal. 
Roll out thin some puff paste, and cut it in circular form 

LofC. 



100 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

about the size of a teaplate. Upon one-half of this round 
piece thickly spread the meat mixture, fold over the other 
half, and pinch the edges of the pastry together. Cut one or 
two small openings in the top, lay the patties on a floured 
pan, and bake in a moderately quick oven. Served with 
drawn butter and mashed potatoes, these patties are deli- 
cious. 

VEAL POTPIE 

Allow three pounds of veal, of either the leg or loin, to 
half a pound of salt pork. Cut the veal in pieces about two 
inches square, and the pork in thin slices. In the bottom of 
the pot in which you cook the potpie lay a few slices of 
pork. Next put in a layer of pieces of veal, and again pork, 
and next veal, till you use your material. Cover the meat 
with lukewarm water, and bring it very slowly to boil. Boil 
slowly about an hour and a half — perhaps it will take more 
time, perhaps less ; it depends upon the condition of your 
veal. When the meat is slightly tender and needs about 
twenty minutes more to be perfectly done, drop dumpling 
dough (see page 82) from a spoon into the boiling liquor. Do 
not let the boiling stop, but boil steadily for fifteen minutes 
or perhaps twenty if your dumplings are large. Then on 
a hot platter lay the meat with the dumplings about it. Boil 
the gravy liquor hard, and for thickening stir in flour worked 
smooth in a little cold water. Season to taste. Pour gravy 
over the meat and put what is left in a gravy bowl. Serve 
the whole hot and as fast as you can. The dumplings should 
be eaten at once. 

A couple of onions and a head of celery may be added 
to the veal in the first part of its cooking if the taste is for 
such seasoning.

CALF'S BRAIN CROQUETTES 

BOIL two pounds of veal until tender. Let it cool in its 
broth, aiid have as little broth as possible. Chop the veal 
fine. Put two sets of calf's brains in cold water to stand for 
one hour. Then drain carefully and take off all the skin and 
stringy part. Put them in hot water to boil, and boil until 
nice and firm. When partly cool chop them fine, and add 
to the veal. Make into oblong croquettes. Have one egg 
beaten, with one tablespoon of cold water. Roll soda crackers 
fine. Season the cracker with salt and red pepper carefully. 
Dip the croquettes in the egg, and roll them in the rolled 
cracker. Get all the croquettes ready before frying. Fry in 
hot fat a nice brown, and use just enough lard to prevent them 
sticking. 

CALF'S BRAINS FRIED 
Brains should be well soaked in water, to remove the 
blood. Afterward cut in small pieces the size of an oyster, 
and fry in butter till well done. They make a delicate and 
choice dish. 

CALF'S BRAINS PICKLED 
After the brains are soaked cut them in pieces and gently 
boil them in milk twenty minutes. Strain off the milk and 



102 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pour over them delicately sour vinegar. They taste much 
like pickled oysters. 

STEWED CALF'S BRAINS 
Lay the brains in cold water for a short time and take 
off the skin. This done, put the brains in a granite stewpan, 
cover with cold water, and set on the back of the stove. 
Add a piece of onion the size of a nutmeg, and stew slowly 
until tender. When done pour off the water and leave out 
the onion. Now cover the brains with milk, season with 
red pepper and salt to taste, and stew fifteen minutes longer. 
Mash together a dessertspoon of butter and a dessertspoon 
of flour, add this to the milk, and stir while boiling slowly 
until it thickens. Lastly grate in this a very little nutmeg 
and two sprigs of chopped parsley. / 

CALF'S FOOT JELLY 
The quantities here given are small, but you can easily 
double or quadruple them. Take a calf's foot, have it split 
in two and the bone cracked in several places so that the 
juices will easily cook out. Souse it freely in cold water, 
and set it over the fire in a pot of cold water — about a quart 
and three-quarters. Cover well, and bring to boil very slowly 
in order to draw the sweetness from the bone. When it 
boils skim and set where it will sleepily bubble and simmer 
for three or four hours. Take from the fire, pour through a 
colander, and set to cool. When cold take off the fat which 
rises to the top, and any coarse sediment at the bottom, heat 
in a porcelain saucepan, and add the grated yellow of half a 
lemon, the juice of the lemon, a small blade of mace, a short 
stick of cinnamon, and a cup of sugar. If you wish their 
flavor, add also a little ginger and a clove, but the jelly is as 
well without them. Lastly stir in the beaten white of an egg, 
cook together gently six or seven minutes, and strain twice 
through a jelly bag. Pour into molds or into small glasses 
from which the jelly may be eaten. Cool thoroughly, and 
serve. 



CALF'S HEAD, HEART 103 

STEWED CALF'S HEAD 

Have the butcher prepare the head for use. When it 
comes to you, wash it thoroughly and remove the brains, 
which may be cooked separately according to the directions 
following or may be included in the stew }ou are about to 
make. Put the head in a pot, cover it with cold water, take 
off the scum that rises as the meat heats, and boil it gently 
for one or two hours, until it is tender. Take it from the 
fire, let it cool, and carefully take out all the bones. Put 
back all the meat in a pot or stewpan, add the brains if you 
wish to stew them, add also a little salt and cayenne pepper, 
and the liquor in which it was boiled, and let it stew slowly 
for an hour. You may serve the meat without further addi- 
tions, merely thickening the gravy with a little flour or corn- 
starch if it seems thin. 

If, however, }ou wish to make the meat a little less simple, 
add half an hour before serving a pint of mushroom buttons. 
If you do not have the mushrooms, a handful of finely 
minced sage is a pleasant addition. Or if you prefer capers 
or green nasturtium seed pickled, they also are good. 

Forcemeat balls are also an agreeable accompaniment to 
meat of the calf's head. 

STUFFED HEART WITK OYSTER DRESSING 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Use veal or lambs' hearts ; four are sufficient. Remove 
the muscle from the centre of each heart. Boil them in 
salted water for one hour. To make the dressing: In a sauce- 
pan have one tablespoon of boiling butter. Add a tablespoon 
of flour, and when browned one minced onion, allowing it 
to brown slightly. Add one teacup of oyster- juice and two 
teacups of cracker crumbs. Season with a pinch of thyme, 
some cayenne pepper, and half a teaspoon of salt. Stir con- 
stantly to prevent burning. Last of all add one dozen 
chopped oysters. Allow the dressing to cook until quite dry. 

StuflF the hearts with this dressing, and lay them in a 



,104 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

baking-pan. Dust a little flour over each heart and lay 
across each one a slice of bacon. Bake fifteen minutes, bast- 
ing with tomato- juice. 

LAMB HEARTS AND LIVERS 
Wash, clean, cut in small pieces, and gently stew till done 
two lamb hearts and livers. Take them from the liquor in 
which they have stewed, chop fine, and add a few bread- 
crumbs, a flavor of parsley and onion, and salt to your taste. 
Put back into their liquor and stew them till the liquor is 
boiled down to a gravy. Then put in a baking dish and set 
in a moderate oven half an hour. Serve in the baking dish 
and garnish with rings or slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

KIDNEY STEW 
Wash very thoroughly two beef kidneys and remove the 
fat. Cut them in thin slices and put in a quart of cold 
water. Parboil, throw away the water, put in fresh water, 
and boil gently two hours. Then season with salt and pepper, 
and thicken with flour to form a smooth gravy. Serve on a 
platter surrounded by a wall of mashed potato, or ladle upon 
pieces of toast. 

KIDNEY STEW WITH CREAM GRAVY 

A SOUTHERN DISH 

Use lamb or veal kidneys. Boil two pairs of kidneys until 
tender, changing the water twice. To one pint of boiling 
milk or cream add one minced onion, one teaspoon of 
minced parsley, one clove of minced garlic, some red pepper 
and half a teaspoon of salt. Add one tablespoon of butter and 
the kidneys, which you have sliced thin. 

Thicken with two tablespoons of flour stirred smooth in 
water, and serve on thin toast. 

KIDNEYS A LA TERRAPIN 
Use six lamb kidneys, or half a beef kidney. First wash 
and then put in cold water enough to cover them, and bring 



CALF'S LIVER 105 

the water to boil. Repeat this. Then boil gently till the 
kidneys are tender. If you use the small lamb kidneys they 
will cook tender in less than an hour. Chop the kidneys till 
they are small dice, and to them add one hard-boiled egg, 
minced. Now make a sauce by blending a tablespoon of 
butter and a tablespoon of flour and adding it to a cup of 
hot milk in a double-boiler. Let the sauce cook till it thick- 
ens, and then salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the chopped 
kidney and egg, and just before serving on small pieces of 
brown toast stir in two tablespoons of wine or one of lemon- 
juice. 

BAKED CALF'S LIVER 

A SOUTHERN DISH 

Dust with flour two pounds of liver, which you have 
bought whole. Lay it in a deep earthen baking-pan. Sea- 
son with pepper and salt and one minced onion, and lay 
across the top half a dozen slices of bacon. Add two cups of 
tomato- juice, with which you baste the liver while it is baking. 
Bake in a moderate oven until the liver is tender enough to 
pierce with a fork. Before serving squeeze the juice of half 
a lemon over the whole. 

LIVER BALLS 

Parboil half a pound of liver. Chop fine, chopping with 
it a slice of bacon. Mix in a teaspoon of chopped capers or 
nasturtium seed, a teaspoon of chopped cucumber pickles, a 
tablespoon of chopped onion, a teaspoon of salt, and a little 
pepper. Add a beaten egg to serve to hold all the ingredients 
together, mold into balls, roll in cracker crumbs and fry in 
a hot saucepan in which you have already fried crisp three 
or four slices of bacon. 

With this there may go well a salad of lettuce dressed 
with French dressing. 

FRIED CALF'S LIVER 
Select tender calf liver, and wash in cold water. Pour 
the water off, and put the liver in a pan. Over it pour boil- 



106 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

ing water. Take it out and wipe dry. Cut in slices and 
season each slice separately with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 
lightly with flour, and lay on a pan, ready to fry. Have the 
frying-pan hot, put into it pieces of bacon, and brown. When 
done take out and lay on a hot platter. Now drop the liver 
into the hot fat, turn often, and cook slowly until done, 
being careful not to cook long enough to harden or burn. 
If more fat is needed, add a little butter and lard. Lay the 
liver in the centre of the platter, the bacon around it, and 
pour the hot fat over it, without any thickening. 

FRIED CALFS LIVER AND BACON 

Put in a frying-pan thin slices of bacon, and let them fry 
quickly in their own fat. Having carefully washed the calf 
liver, cut slices not too thin, say a third of an inch — for if 
liver is cut too thin it will fry dry and hard. Take out the 
bacon as soon as it is crisp, putting it in a hot dish. Lay the 
slices of the liver in the fat left in the frying-pan, and cook 
over not too hot a fire till thoroughly done. Then dish with 
the bacon, seasoning lightly with salt and pepper. 

Onions are sometimes served with fried liver. They may 
be parboiled and then sliced into the pan, seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and fried with the liver. Lay the bacon and 
onions on the liver as a garnish in serving. 

LIVER RISSOLES 

Take a pound of calf liver, put it in hot water enough to 
cover, and boil it till tender. Take from the water, cool, and 
mince it fine, adding and mincing with it quarter of a pound 
of beef suet. Add quarter of a pound of fine or grated 
breadcrumbs, a pinch of cayenne, a little salt, and two eggs 
thoroughly beaten. Shape the meat in the form of corks or 
small eggs or large walnuts, and drop into boiling hot lard. 
As the rissoles brown skim them from the fat, lay them a 
minute to drain upon brown paper or a colander, and send 
to the table hot. 



SWEETBREADS 107 

TO CHOOSE AND PREPARE SWEETBREADS 

In picking out sweetbreads choose the larger, plumper> 
fleshier. Also be careful that they are perfectly fresh, for 
of all meats they stand keeping least well. Rinse and put 
them in lukewarm water to lie fifteen minutes. Then cover 
with slightly salted cold water, set on the fire, and bring to 
boil. When the water begins to boil drop them suddenly in 
a pan of cold water. The sudden change of temperature 
blanches them. Cut the sweetbreads apart, cut out the pipe, 
and take ofif the skin. They are now ready for creaming or 
other cooking. 

CREAMED SWEETBREADS 
Carefully choose a pair of fresh sweetbreads, trim oflf 
their fat, and follow the above directions for parboiling. 
Cut them in small pieces, and simmer twenty minutes in only 
enough water to make a steam. Then add a cup of rich 
milk, rub smooth a tablespoon of flour and a tablespoon of 
butter, moisten \vith some of the milk from the saucepan, 
add a pinch of salt, and stir all together over a moderate fire 
until the flour cooks and thickens. 

SWEETBREADS FRIED 

Wash and trim the sweetbreads, lay in a pan, and pour 
boiling water over them. Let stand for fifteen minutes. 
Beat one egg with one tablespoon of water, and have some 
cracker rolled fine and seasoned with salt and red pepper. 
Dip the sweetbreads first in the egg, and then in the cracker. 
Fry in just enough hot lard to cook, and brown nicely a 
light brown. 

SWEETBREADS WITH OYSTERS 

Wash free from skin and pipes and blanch the sweet- 
breads according to directions given above. 

Have at hand three dozen oysters. Put the sweetbreads 
in a saucepan, add the liquor from the oysters, add also two 



108 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

tablespoons of butter and set to simmer till the sweetbreads 
are done. When done pour in half a cup of cream into 
which a teaspoon of flour has been stirred. Bring to boil, 
drop in the oysters, and heat through or until the edges curl. 

SWEETBREADS WITH TOMATOES* 

Stew a quart of tomatoes in a porcelain saucepan. When 
the tomatoes are thoroughly cooked, put them through a 
sieve and you will have a thick sauce. Have four sweet- 
breads cleaned, blanched, cut a.part and ready for use, ac- 
cording to foregoing directions. Lay them in the tomato 
sauce, add salt, pepper, and nutmeg to your taste, and set 
over the fire. As the sauce heats add half a cup of butter 
into which you have stirred a tablespoon of flour. Let the 
sweetbreads cook in a gentle simmer in the tomatoes about 
forty minutes. Serve with buttered toast or without, as you 
prefer. 

SWEETBREADS STEWED 

Sweetbreads are stewed according to directions for "Stewed 
Calf's Brains." Cut them in half to cook, and before the milk 
is added cut them in pieces a little smaller. 

TRIPE FRICASSEE 

AN ITALIAN DISH 

Cut into dice one pound of boiled tripe and lay in vinegar 
for ten minutes. Make boiling hot one tablespoon of butter 
in a deep casserole. Roll the tripe in flour and brown in the 
boiling butter. Add one minced onion, a pinch of rosemary, 
a dash of cayenne pepper, and half a teaspoon of salt. Add 
also two cups of strained canned tomatoes, also one teacup 
of beef or chicken soup, or water. Allow to simmer for ten 
minutes. Serve in a flat dish, and sprinkle over all two 
tablespoons of grated cheese. 

The Italians add one tablespoon of Marsala wine to the 
sauce when the dish is removed from the fire. 



TRIPE 109 

TRIPE FRICASSEE 

A PHILADELPHIA DISH 

To one pint of boiling milk or cream add one pound of 
boiled tripe which has been cut in pieces one inch square. 
Season with one minced onion, a teaspoon of minced parsley, 
a teaspoon of celery seed, a dash of cayenne pepper, half a 
teaspoon of salt, and three or four pieces of mace. Allow 
to simmer fifteen minutes. Thicken with two tablespoons of 
flour, stirred in one tablespoon of butter. Serve on thin 
toast. 

FRIED TRIPE 

Select only the coarse honeycombed tripe. It is sold 
already boiled, but it is not tender. Put it in a saucepan, 
cover with cold salted water, and boil very tender. When 
done cut it into pieces three inches and a half long and two 
inches wide. Roll four soda crackers fine, and season with 
salt and red pepper to taste. Beat one egg with one table- 
spoon of cold water. Dip the tripe into the egg and then turn 
it over on both sides in the cracker. Have ready a frying- 
pan with hot lard and butter mixed, enough to cook the tripe 
slowly and a light brown. When done, lay the pieces on a 
hot platter, and pour three tablespoons of vinegar into the 
hot fat that is left. Pour this over the tripe, and serve.

BOILED MUTTON 

USE any part of the mutton }'OU wish ; the shoulder is good. 
Put it in a granite soup kettle, cover with cold water, 
and skim when it boils. Boil slowly until done very tender, 
which may be three hours or more. Peel and cut in half, 
and add four large onions. Add also salt and pepper to 
taste, and a teacup of stewed and seasoned tomatoes. When 
done, take out the mutton and thicken the liquor with flour 
and water mixed smooth to the thickness of cream. Use 
this for gravy. 

BOILED LAMB 

Select the hindquarter. Wash in cold water, and wipe 
dry. Put into a granite kettle with salted water, enough to 
cover it. Boil gently until perfectly tender, which you will 
discover by probing with a fork, in the thickest part. It 
may take two hours. Be sure it is perfectly well done. 
Serve with drawn butter and eggs, or with caper sauce. 

TO BOIL A LEG OF MUTTON 

Take a "hung" but perfectly, sweet leg of mutton. Wash, 
but do not soak it; put in a kettle in which it will fit 
well — one neither too large nor too small — and little more 
than cover it with cold water. Set the kettle over a moderate 
fire, and as the scum rises take it off. Next put in a table- 



■ MUTTON AND LAMB '111 

spoon of salt, and add three onions and a bouquet made of 
thyme, summer savory, and parsley. Next put in four or 
five carrots, and after these have been heated through add 
as many peeled turnips. Now set the kettle on a spot where 
its contents will boil gently — simmer, merely gurgle slug- 
gishly — and let it stand with uninterrupted heat for two 
hours and a half. If it stews gently the mutton will be 
deUcious. If it boils hard it will be leathery, tasteless rag, 
like all fast-boiled meats served up by ignorant, careless, 
or uneconomical housekeepers. Serve the leg of mutton 
on a hot platter with caper sauce, or oyster sauce, or nasturtium 
sauce. From the liquor in which the leg is cooked an excel- 
lent soup or bouillon is made. If in boiling the mutton you 
have any bones of mutton, veal, beef, put them in the pot and 
they increase the strength and tastiness of the soup. Let 
the liquor cool and remove the fat that rises to the top before 
you try to use for soup. 

BONED LEG OF MUTTON 

You can yourself cut the bone out of the leg, using a 
sharp, thin-pointed knife and scraping the flesh from the 
bone; or have it done at the market before the leg is sent to 
you. To fill in where the bone was removed, make a 
stuffing of breadcrumbs and chopped hard-boiled eggs, 



A French Kitchen Knife 

chopped salt-pickled pork, chopped onions if your taste 
allows, a sprinkling of powdered sage leaves, and a few 
pickled olives or capers. Salt and pepper must be at your 
discretion. Force this dressing in the leg, tie it firmly, and 
roast in moderate oven several hours, not forgetting to baste 
the meat. 



112 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

TO BROIL MUTTON CHOPS 
Choose thick chops, or have them cut thick — an inch or, 
better still, an inch and a half thick. Meat dealers will 
french chops for you if you wish ; that is, they trim off the 
narrow meat from the rib, cut off the rib-bone so that only 
a part of it remains, and the large muscle rounding and 
nestling in the double-bone forms the chop. With your chop 
frenched or in ordinary form, proceed as in the directions 
for broiling beefsteak on page 89. In serving omit the butter, 
because the chop carries natural fat with it. 

LAMB CHOPS BROILED 
Trim from six lamb chops the fat and membrane on the 
edge — it is apt to impart a disagreeably woolly taste to the 
meat. Melt some butter in a pie plate and dip the chops 
in it, covering every bit of the meat with the butter, dredge 
with flour, salt and pepper, lay in the broiler, and keep turning 
over a clear hot fire until the meat is done. Set the chops on 
their ends about a bouquet of parsley and serve immediately. 
[See illustration, Plate 11. ] 

BROILED CHOP FOR AN INVALID 
French a rib chop by scraping the long part of the bone 
until all fat is removed. Lay on a clean buttered paper the 
shape of the chop and cut double. Fold the edges of the 
paper over and together, thus forming a case. Place on a 
gridiron, broil six minutes, transfer from the case to a hot 
platter, and serve at once. 

TO SERVE COLD MUTTON 
While you are frying in a saucepan some hashed potatoes, 
cut large, thin slices from a piece of cold mutton. Lay the 
mutton round the centre of a platter, letting the pieces over- 
lap one another, and upon each piece drop a teaspoon of 
currant jelly. Tip the hot hashed potatoes in the centre of 
the platter and serve. 



MUTTON AND LAMB 113 

A good variation from the plain currant jelly is to whip 
half a glass of currant jelly with a teaspoon of made mus- 
tard until all is a froth, and drop this from a spoon upon the 
pieces of mutton. Easier than a fork for the beating is a 
regular egg-beater, 

MUTTON CROMESKIES 

Mince cold mutton and season it to your taste with minced 
onion, salt and pepper. On thin slices of bacon lay as much 
of the minced mutton as each slice will hold, in other words 
wrap spoonfuls of the mutton with thin slices of bacon. 
Fasten the bacon by using wooden toothpicks as skewers, 
thus forming cromeskies. Dip each of the cromeskies in a 
frying batter, or in a saucer of raw egg, and then into pow- 
dered cracker, drop in deep hot fat, and fry a delicate brown. 
Serve hot with mashed potato or with plain boiled rice. 

CROWN ROAST OF MUTTON 

The rack of mutton or lamb is used for this, and the roast 
is cut from a loin, curled, and tied in the form of a crown. 
Or the crown form is obtained from corresponding ribs on 
either side of the animal being tied together and curled out- 
ward. The ribs are chopped apart at the backbone. The 
chops are frenched — that is, freed from meat toward the 
sharp end of the rib. The meat at this point may be cut off 
or scraped to fall over into the centrepiece of the crown. 
In the centre of the round roast lay chopped mutton or lamb 
well seasoned and mixed with breadcrumbs in the proportion 
of one-third crumbs to two-thirds meat. Salt the roast and 
bake, basting often and allowing an hour and a quarter to 
an hour and a half. Serve with green peas and mashed 
potatoes. 

ROAST LAMB 

Select the fore or hind quarter, if the lamb is young 
(which it should be), to roast. Wash in cold water, and dry 
with a cloth. Lay on a frame in the baking-pan, pepper and 



114 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

salt it, lightly rubbing the salt on. Set in a hot oven. Turn 
the meat from side to side as it cooks. Baste every ten 
minutes, and let it cook well done. Lamb should never be at 
all rare. Allow about twelve minutes to a pound in roasting. 
Serve with gravy or mint sauce. For gravy, strain the water 
the meat is cooked and basted with, and thicken with flour 
mixed with water and added before setting the pan on the 
stove. Stir constantly until the gravy pours nicely, and 
strain if at all lumpy. 

ROAST LAMB WITH KIDNEY 

Have the bone cut out of leg of a lamb, and fill in the 
hollow with kidney cooked tender, minced, mixed with bread- 
crumbs and well seasoned. If you have mushrooms, add a 
few to the stuffing. Roast in a hot oven and add nasturtium 
seeds or capers to the gravy. 

LEG OF MUTTON STUFFED 

Boil two or three white onions until tender. Chop them 
in a bowl with breadcrumbs and season with sage, pepper, 
and salt. Slit the leg of mutton at the sinews, pack in the 
.stuffing, and roast, basting the leg frequently. 

MINCED MUTTON ON TOAST 

Chop fine the yolks of two or three hard-boiled eggs. To 
them add half a teaspoon of mixed mustard, a pinch of salt, 
and a dash of cayenne. When well stirred together, mix in 
a cup of cold cooked mutton well minced, and half a cup of 
cream. Set over the fire, and when hot spread upon toast 
of white bread cut in triangles, circles, squares, or fingers. 

Some cooks add to this dish a tablespoon or two of 
sherry. But the mince is good without the wine, and we do 
not encourage the use of such flavorings for simple, everyday 
cooking. 



MUTTON AND LAMB 115 

IRISH STEW 

When you buy your mutton for the stew have the butcher 
cut in between the joints, giving the effect of chops. It is 
useless for you to buy the loin — a waste of money and not 
so good a piece because of its fat. It is the scrag or neck 
piece you want for Irish stew, for a small stew two pounds. 
Slice three or four onions in a hot iron pot and let them 
fry in their own juice till they are light brown. Don't burn 
them. Then add slowly a quart and a half of cold water 
and lay in the meat. Let the water slowly come to boil, and 
after it has boiled up and you have skimmed it, set it back 
upon the stove, where it will merely bubble and simmer — not 
boil. Let it stay for two hours, adding a teaspoon of salt, 
and keeping it tightly covered. 

Peel as many potatoes as you want to use. Slice two in 
thin slices for dissolving and thickening the gravy. The 
water will be pretty well boiled out, but don't mind that; 
you want only enough for a gravy, not enough for a broth. 
Cut the potatoes in two if they seem too large, and put them 
all, the sliced and halved, over the mutton. Set the pot for- 
ward over a little brisker fire. Be sure to fit the cover tight 
on, to keep in steam and preserve the flavor. Allow three- 
quarters of an hour for the potatoes to cook, and serve the 
stew smoking hot upon a hot platter. 

SCOTCH HOTCHPOTCH 

Wash and :cut in small pieces two pounds of the scrag or 
neck of mutton. Put it over tlie fire with three cups of 
water, bring it slowly to boil, and cook it slowly and gently 
for an hour and a half, keeping it covered tight. Then cut 
into dice a small carrot, two onions and a turnip, and add to 
the meat. Add also half a can of fine marrowfat peas and 
a teaspoon of salt. Cook till all the vegetables are thoroughly 
tender, and twenty minutes before serving add the other half 
of the can of peas. If the liquid is fat after you take up the 
meat, skim it. The peas and vegetables will have thickened 



116 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the gravy, but you may need a dessertspoon of flour for 
thickening in addition. Serve on a platter, the mutton in the 
centre and the vegetables surrounding it. 

LAMB STEW 

Slice four good-sized onions thin, rinse in cold water, 
and cook in an iron frying-pan, with enough cold water to 
cover them. Slice the cold lamb in thin slices and pieces. 
When the onions are done put in the meat, season with salt 
and pepper, and add a half-teacup of stewed tomato and any 
cold gravy you may have left from the lamb. Have enough 
water to cover the meat. Stew slowly one hour. Thicken 
with flour dissolved and stirred smooth in cold water. Pour 
this into the middle of the stew, and stir with the back of 
the spoon to prevent lumping. Cover and keep hot.

BACON AND EGGS 

HAVE a saucepan well heated, and in it lay thin slices of 
bacon. Fry on both sides till crisp. Put on a hot platter, 
and into the hot fat remaining in the saucepan slip eggs, one 
at a time, from a saucer. Cook till slightly browned on one 
side, then turn and brown on the other side. Lay the eggs 
on the platter, put a slice or two of bacon on each egg and ' 
serve at once. 

FRIED BACON 
Bacon is best cooked not in an iron frying-pan, but on 
tin or granite. Heat hot an omelet pan or a tin pie-plate. 
Cook rather slowly, turning the bacon from one side to the 
other, until a nice brown without being hard. Serve on a hot 
dish, and pour over it whatever quantity of the fat is wished. 

BOILED BACON WITH BOILED CABBAGE 

Choose a piece of bacon sufficient for the number re- 
quired. Put it in a pot and cover it with cold water. Skim 
when it comes to boil, and boil until tender, which will be 
one hour or one hour and a half. When done lay it on a 
platter and surround it with hot boiled cabbage. 

JOWL AND GREENS 
The jowl of the hog salted and cured is delicious and 
appetizing when cooked with young spring dandelion, beet, 



118 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

or other fresh, tender greens. Wash the jowl and set it over 
a. brisk fire in a kettle. There should be enough cold water 
to cover it. When the water comes to boil, skim and set the 
kettle where the water will gently bubble. Allow three td 
four hours for its cooking. 

The greens you cook with it should be thoroughly washed 
through several waters, and added in time to cook through 
and be perfectly done by the time the jowl is cooked. If 
you use cabbage as the vegetable, or turnips, or young dan- 
delions, or young beets, allow for their cooking an hour at 
least; two hours is better. For potatoes allow half or three- 
quarters of an hour. Cut the cabbage into quarters, and 
examine it closely for creeping things, 

PORK AND BEANS 

Soak a quart of white beans overnight. Next morning 
« drain off the water, cover with fresh water and bring to boil. 
Pour off this water, cover again with cold water, and add 
a square piece of pork weighing about half a pound. Score 
the skin of the pork before putting it in with the beans. Boil 
slowly until the beans are growing soft, then stir in a heap- 
ing tablespoon of brown sugar or a half of a small cup of 
molasses. Put all in a dripping-pan, with the pork in the 
centre, and bake an hour or more, till the top of the beans 
has a brown crust. 

See also "Baked Beans," Chapter XVII. 

TO CURE HAMS 

After they are thoroughly cold and free from animal heat, 
pack the hams in a barrel or cask, laying them skin-side 
down. Make carefully the following brine: Weigh out 
twenty pounds of coarse salt, two pounds of sugar or two 
quarts of New Orleans molasses, and half a pound of salt- 
petre. Measure fourteen gallons of water. Put all in the 
big kettle or wash-boiler you wish to make the brine in, set 
over the fire, and when the scum begins to rise begin to skim» 



• PORK 119 

By the time the brine boils you will have it clear. When it 
has boiled a few minutes, set it off the fire to become cold. 
After the hams have lain in the brine from three to six 
weeks you will want to smoke them. If you have no smoke- 
house, improvise one by getting a barrel or, if a barrel is not 
large enough, a hogshead. Across its bottom nail poles, and 
on the poles string your hams, having tied a cord loop into 
each. Take an old iron pot half full of ashes and build a 
fire of green hickory chips or of corncobs in it. Don't have 
more than a double handful of fuel, for you must avoid heat. 
Smoke is what you want, not heat. To make the fire put 
live coals on the ashes, and then lay on the coals your cobs 
or chips. The fire must smoulder and smoke, not burn to 
make heat which would cook and spoil your hams. Set the 
pot of smudge on the ground, and over it the hogshead, up- 
side down, with the hams hanging from its bottom. If 
smoke leaks from the hogshead cover it with things you have 
at hand — papers, old carpets, etc. When the hams are suffi- 
ciently smoked, put each one in a paper sack or in cloth bags. 
To rub the flesh side and the end of the leg with bladlc, 
cayenne or red pepper before smoking is thought by some 
to be a preventive against the attack of insects and to save 
putting the hams in bags. 

TO BOIL A HAM 
First wash and scrape the ham and soak it all night in 
plenty of cold water. In the morning put it in a kettle and 
cover it with gold water. You may add if you wish a table- 
spoon of brown sugar, a sprig of thyme, and a few allspice, 
but many prefer the ham cooked in water to which no flavor 
has been added. When the water begins to boil, skim and 
set the kettle on the back of the stove where the water will 
boil gently. In this way let it boil five or six hours, when the 
ham will be well cooked. Tip it from the kettle, or lift it 
out to an earthen jar or wooden bowl, and leave the ham in 
the liquor in which it was boiled, to get cold. Then take off 
the skin and cover with rasped breadcrumbs. 



120 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

If you wish to add browning also to the ham — which 
some Hke — skin the ham while hot, place it in a dripping- 
pan, sprinkle over it sugar and breadcrumbs, and bake an hour. 

But if the ham is left to cool in its own liquor, it seems 
to have an especially fine and juicy flavor. 

HAM BOILED IN CIDER 

Wash a ham thoroughly clean. Soak overnight in clear, 
cold water. Next morning bring to boil a kettle of cider. 
Be sure you use a porcelain-lined kettle, so that the cider 
will not be affected by the metal. Do not poison the ham by 
using tin. In the boiling cider lay the freshened ham and 
boil it slowly from five to eight hours, according to the size 
and needs of the ham. Set to cool in the liquid in which it 
boils. If you wish a spice taste to the ham, while it is boil- 
ing throw in the cider a little cinnamon, mace, and cloves 
tied in a thin muslin bag. 

JAMBOLAYA 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Mince fine all pieces of ham you can get off a well-cut- 
from bone. Fry these with four slices of raw bacon chopped 
very fine. Add one onion minced fine, and two or more cups 
of cold boiled rice. Add enough strained tomatoes to give 
liquid and keep the rice from burning. Stir constantly and 
season with thyme, salt, and one pepper pod chopped fine. 
If you have a few cold sausages, or cold chicken or turkey, 
chop fine and add. Fry until all seems quite dry, remove 
from the fire, add two eggs, beat in, and then turn the whole 
into a porcelain dish and baste over with a little butter. Set 
in the oven to form a crust over the top. 

HOG'S HEAD CHEESE 

Have your butcher split the head and clean it. Wash it 
thoroughly and put it into a kettle of boiling water, the 
water being enough to completely cover it. Cover the kettle 



PORK 121 

tight and boil gently till the meat separates freely from the 
bones. Take the head in a pan and pick out all the bones. 
Next put it in your chopping bowl and chop fine. While 
in the bowl season, to a pint of meat a tablespoon of salt, a 
tablespoon of finely powdered sage, and also a saltspoon of 
pepper. Mix thoroughly and moisten with the thick liquid 
left from the boiling head, half a cup to a pint of the meat. 
Taste to see if the seasoning is right. If not, add what you 
think is lacking. Set on the fire when you have completed 
the seasoning, cook slowly half an hour, pour into molds 
or bowls, and set to cool. A little melted lard poured over 
the top of the head cheese after it cools shuts out the air and 
helps to preserve it. Keep in a cold place. Serve the cheese 
cut in smooth slices. 

HOLLAND MEAT PIE 

Take one pound of raised bread dough and roll it to one- 
eighth of an inch thick and six inches wide, and just as long 
as possible without breaking the dough. Then lay along the 
centre a mixture made of two pounds of lean sausage meat 
highly seasoned with sage, thyme, and summer savory. Then 
bring the long edges of the dough over and pinch them to- 
gether, using water to make them adhere. Pinch the ends 
together also. Now brush with beaten egg and sprinkle 
with caraway seeds and coil on a greased pan. Bake until 
the dough is risen and richly browned. Garnish with fried 
parsley and serve either hot or cold. [See illustration, 
Plate XL] 

MOCK DUCK 

Split down its length a pork tenderloin. In the opening 

stuff a forcemeat such as you make for duck. Sew the 

opening together to inclose completely the stuffing, put in a 

dripping-pan, rub the meat with flour, salt, and pepper, add 

a cup of boiling water, and roast, frequently basting till the 

meat is thoroughly cooked. Draw out the thread and lay 
^ 6 .Vol. 2 



122 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

on a hot platter. Serve with it apples cooked till soft, and 
without sugar. 

CROWN ROAST OF PORK 
A dozen pork chops should be tied round in crown form 
for this dish. The ribs rising at the top should be trimmed 
free from meat and all be cut till of the same height. The 
centre of the crown fill with sausage meat well seasoned and 
lightened by one-third its quantity of breadcrumbs. Roast 
in a moderate oven till thoroughly done, allowing three full 
hours. Serve the meat with apples cooked without sugar, 
and also with plain boiled onions and mashed potato. 

ROAST PORK WITH SAGE 
Rub a loin roast with flour, salt, and generously sprinkle 
with pulverized sage. Put in a dripping-pan with a cup of 
hot water and set in the oven. Baste often with the little 
water and the fat from the meat and the sage on the bottom 
of the dripping-pan. Allow two and a half to three hours 
for a six-pound loin roast. When done put the meat on a 
hot platter, pour off much of the fat in the dripping-pan, set 
the pan on the stove, add a teacup of hot water, stir in a 
tablespoon of flour dissolved in cold water, and cook till 
thick. This gravy will be seasoned with the sage remaining 
in the dripping-pan. 

ROAST TENDERLOINS 
Split two tenderloins lengthwise, or direct your market 
man to do so when you purchase. Make a stuffing or force- 
meat of breadcrumbs, and season well with onions and 
sage and salt. Fill the tenderloins with the forcemeat, salt 
and pepper the outside of the meat. Set in a dripping-pan 
with a little hot water, and roast in a hot oven two or three 
hours — the time you must judge by the size of the loin. An 
added flavor is gained by fastening two or three slices of 
bacon with wooden toothpicks to the tenderloin. Eat hot 
or cold. 



PORK 123 

BROILED PORK TENDERLOINS 

Split pork tenderloins open lengthwise, and season highly 
with salt and pepper. If cooked on a gas stove (which is 
best), broil on a wire frame set in a shallow pan, under the 
flame. Cook slowly. Have a pie-pan with a tablespoon of 
butter dissolved in two or more tablespoons of hot water. 
Take out the tenderloins, and turn them over and over in 
the butter and water while cooking. Baste them in this way 
every five minutes to make them juicy. Cook thoroughly 
and a light brown, and avoid cooking them hard. Lay on 
hot dish and pour over melted butter seasoned with salt and 
pepper. If cooked with coal or wood stove, use the oven 
and follow same directions. 

FRIED SALT PORK WITH FRIED APPLES 

Pour boiling water over slices of salt pork. Have care 
that the rind is clean. Put the pork in a hot iron saucepan 
and fry both sides till it is crisp. Lay the slices on a hot 
platter. Have ready some quick-cooking, tart apples, not 
peeled but washed, wiped, and sliced m thin slices straight 
across the apple. Slip these into the hot fat left from the 
fried pork, cover tight, stir occasionally, and cook the apples 
till they are tender. Lay in a circle round the pork and serve 
all hot. 

OLD-FASHIONED SALT PORK WITH MILK GRAVY 

Cut the pork in thin slices, put it in a frying-pan and 
cover with fresh cold water. When the water begins to 
steam pour it off. Set the pan back on the fire and fry the 
pork till crisp in its own fat. Take out the slices and lay 
on a hot platter. Pour off the grease in your drippings jar, 
keeping about a tablespoon in the pan. Put back the pan 
on the fire, and stir a couple of tablespoons of flour in the 
fat. Then pour in a cup of milk. The milk will cook and 
thicken with the flour. Stir well and pour on the platter 



124 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

with the pork. Serve this pork with unsweetened apple- 
sauce and mashed potatoes. 

TO FRY PORK SAUSAGES 

In a hot saucepan put a teaspoon of butter or drippings, 
and in the fat brown a chopped onion or two. When the 
onion is brown squeeze in the juice of half a lemon or of a 
whole lemon if you have several sausages. Then put in your 
sausages and cook through, keeping the saucepan covered. 
Lay the sausages on a hot platter, shake a tablespoon of 
browned flour in the saucepan, add two or three tablespoons 
of boiling water, boil up, and pour the gravy on the platter 
beside the sausages. 

SAUSAGE AND EGGS 

If you have a sausage or two left over, utilize them with 
scrambled eggs. Cut the sausage in small circles and heat 
in a saucepan. When heated through the sausage has left a 
little fat in the pan. Pour in three well-beaten eggs to which 
two tablespoons of milk or cream have been added. Stir 
the eggs till they cook thick and smooth. Season with salt 
while they cook, and serve at once.

BAKED CHICKEN WITH OYSTER DRESSING 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

TO a tablespoon of boiling butter add one minced onion, a 
good pinch of rosemary, the same of thyme, and one small 
minced red pepper. When these are browned, add one cup 
of oyster- juice. Let all simmer five minutes, and then add 
two cups of boiled rice and one cup of minced lean of ham. 
Brown a little and then add two dozen chopped oysters. Stir 
until it all becomes quite brown, remove from the saucepan, 
and stuff the fowl. Under each pinion and between each 
thigh and the body lay a thin slice of bacon. Tie down the 
drum-bone knuckles and fasten the wings, dust the bird with 
flour, and lay some thin slices of bacon over the breast. Lay 
the bird in a roasting-pan, and use two teacups of tomato- 
juice and one of oyster-juice to baste with. Add the giblets 
boiled tender and chopped to the gravy formed in the pan. 
Bake one hour, basting often. 

BROILED CHICKEN 

A chicken weighing about two pounds when dressed 
should be prepared for broiling by being split down the back. 



120 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Spread out the bird and la} it in a baking-pan in which you 
have poured half a cup of boiling water. Cover tight, set 
over the fire or in a brisk oven, and let the chicken cook in 
the steam till the meat is nearly done. If the hot water 
cooks away add a little more. Just before the chicken is 
wholly cooked put it on your gridiron or broiler and finish the 
cooking over a direct fire, buttering it a little as it broils. Lay 
the broiled chicken on a hot dish, spread upon it maitre 
d'hotel sauce and serve. 

CREAMED CHICKEN 

Clean and cut up in neat pieces two chickens. Put them 
on to boil and before they are done pare some potatoes, cut 
them in two, lay them on top of the chicken and let them 
boil till done. Then take up the potatoes carefully on a plate 
by themselves. Pour a pint of cream upon the chicken, let 
it heat, then thicken with a scant tablespoon of flour dis- 
solved in a small half cup of milk. Season with salt, pepper, 
and fresh butter. If you have no cream milk will answer, 
but more butter will be required. 

CREAMED CHICKEN FOR COMPANY 

Take the meat of two chickens which have been roasted 
or boiled and cut into small pieces. Mix half a pint of milk 
with one pint of cream, heat in a double-boiler, and pour 
over three tablespoons of flour which have been stirred into 
a piece of butter the size of an egg. Add salt and cayenne to 
taste. Stir the cream until it thickens. Into an earthen 
baking dish put a layer of the cut chicken. Over this a, 
layer of cream. Then a layer of chicken. Then cream. So 
do till the dish is full with a cream layer on top. Sprinkle 
with fine breadcrumbs and bake an hour in a moderate oven. 

If you use all milk, allow more butter. And if you use 
small individual dishes instead of a large baking dish allow 
less time for tlie baking, say twenty minutes. For conven- 
ience you may put together the cream and chicken in the 



POULTRY AND GAME 127 

morning, and not bake till the later hour of the day in which 
you want the dish; but in that event be sure t«o keep the 
chicken in a cool place so that the cream will not sour. 

CHICKEN WITH CREA'M SAUCE 

For one chicken boiled and cut as for salad, make a 
sauce of one pint of rich milk, two tablespoons of flour, and 
one tablespoon of butter. Heat the milk in a double-boiler, 
and then add the flour and butter. Take half a can of mush- 
rooms, cut them in pieces, and boil them gently five minutes 
in their own liquor. Add them to the hot milk sauce, boil 
three minutes, stir in the chicken, and serve either in a large 
dish or in small hot shells. 

CHICKEN CURRY 

Chop two large onions and put in a kettle with three- 
fourths of a cup of butter, and cook the onions till brown. 
Add a young, tender chicken of three or four pounds, the 
chicken having been cut in small pieces. Add also half a 
tablespoon of curry, three fresh tomatoes, or one cup of 
canned tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover tight 
and simmer an hour or longer. Then add a cup of milk and 
boil up once. About the rim of a platter bank fresh boiled 
rice, pour the hot curry in the middle so the walls of rice 
will hold it, and serve hot. 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN 

Separate all the joints of the chicken and wash in cold 
water. Then put in a granite kettle. Add two large onions 
cut in half, and two slices of salt pickled pork. Cover two 
inches above the chicken with cold water. When it begins 
to boil add pepper and salt, and season carefully and highly. 
Cook until very tender. Cut slices of stale bread into ob- 
long pieces two inches wide. Lay these on a hot platter. 
Take out the chicken and place it on the bread. Mix flour 
and water together smoothly, pour this into the gravy, taste. 



128 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and boil until it thickens. Then pour over the bread and 
chicken. It commonly takes about four heaping tablespoons 
of flour to thicken, 

FRIED CHICKEN 

Wash and cut the chicken, separating each joint. Sprinkle 
the pieces with salt, pepper, and flour before you begin to 
fry. Have ready the frying-pan with hot lard. Fry the meat 
slowly until well cooked and a nice brown, being careful not 
to burn it. When done, pour off nearly all the fat. Then add 
milk or milk and cream for a gravy. Mix about two table- 
spoons of flour smoothly in cold water, put into the milk, 
stirring constantly until it thickens. Pour the gravy over 
the chicken. 

CHICKEN LOAF 

Boil a fowl till the meat is ready to fall from the bones. 
Salt while boiling. Take from its liquor, and while you are 
picking out the bones let the liquor boil down so that it 
measures not more than three cups. To this add quarter of 
a box of gelatine which you have already soaked and softened. 
Round the bottom of a mold or bowl lay two hard-boiled 
eggs sliced in circles. Upon this put a layer of dark meat, 
then a layer of light meat, and so alternate till you have 
used up the chicken. Do not pack the meat tight, but leave 
space for the liquor to fill in. See that the seasoning is right, 
add pepper if wished, and then pour the liquor over the meat, 
seeing first that the gelatine is well dissolved. Set away to 
chill, and the liquor will harden to a jelly. Tip on a platter 
when served. 

A nice dish for Sunday evening supper. 

CHICKEN AND MUSHROOMS 

In a saucepan melt two tablespoons of butter, and when 
hot add two tablespoons of minced onion and half a can of 
mushrooms chopped. Let cook for five minutes, and add a 
cup of milk into which a tablespoon and a half of flour has 



POULTRY AND GAME 129 

been stirred. Cook all together, and when thick and smooth 
add a cup of chicken meat cut inlto small pieces or dice. Heat 
through, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve all 
together in a hot dish, or on pieces of toast of a golden 
brown, or in shells of pastry of the individual patty-pan size. 

AUNT NANCY'S SMOTHERED CHICKEN 

Have tender chicken for this dish, and cut in pieces as 
for fricassee. Roll the chicken in flour in which is mixed 
salt and pepper needful for seasoning, and put in a skillet 
(saucepan) in which is a little cream. Cover close. Turn 
the chicken often and add cream or milk when necessary to 
keep from burning. Cook sloivly one hour, and just before it 
is done add a little butter. 

PANNED BREAST OF CHICKEN 

Place the breast in a small baking dish with a little boil- 
ing water. Cook till brown, basting frequently. Season 
nicely and serve on a hot plate with a border of rice and 
olives. [See illustration, Plate XII.] 

CHICKEN PIE 

Take two fat young fowls, cut them in pieces, put in a 
pot, nearly cover with boiling water, and cook slowly. After 
they have cooked three-quarters of an hour add a pint of raw 
potatoes cut in slices, and cook ten minutes from the time 
they began again to simmer. Salt to taste. Have a deep pan 
lined with a biscuit crust, that is a dough made after baking 
powder biscuit receipt. The dough should be rolled thicker 
than the common fruit-pie crust. Lay cooked chicken in the 
pan, then put in a Ia}er of potato, and so alternate till you 
have used your material. Thicken the water in which the 
chickens cooked by stirring in three or four tablespoons of 
flour dissolved in a little cold water and boiling up the liquor. 
Pour this over the chicken and potato in the deep pan, add a 
tablespoon or two of butter — more or less, according to the 



130 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

fatness of your chickens — two or three hard-boiled eggs, 
sliced, and taste again to see that salt and pepper are right. 
Cover with a top crust, score the centre of the top so that 
steam may escape, pinch down the edges tight, and bake two 
hours in a moderate oven. 

Two ingredients not mentioned above may be included, 
if one's taste wishes. One is a cup of stale breadcrumbs 
with the gravy, and another is a cup of chopped boiled ham. 

CHICKEN POTPIE 

Singe, draw, wash, and cut up two fat fowls. Lay them 
in a pot with quarter of a pound of salt pork cut in slices, 
and cover with tepid water. Bring slowly to boil, and cook 
slowly till the meat is about to separate from the bone. No 
time can be set, because the flesh of the fowl may be tender 
or may be tough. It is best to allow two hours and a half 
or three hours. If your fowls are tough, then you have 
time to cook tender ; if they are tender and the meat gets 
done before you are ready for it, hold up the cooking by 
setting the pot in a warm place. Twenty minutes before 
serving bring the chickens to a quick boil and drop from a 
tablespoon pieces of dumpling dough (described on page 82). 
Do not let the boiling stop, but keep it up for fifteen minutes 
or perhaps twenty minutes. Then lift your meat to a hot 
platter and lay on also the dumplings. Into the boiling 
gravy stir flour worked smooth in a little cold water. Season 
to taste, and when the flour thickens ladle some of the gravy 
over the meat and dumplings. Serve the rest of the gravy 
in a bowl. 

PLAIN POTTED CHICKEN 

Boil the chicken till tender and ready to fall from the 
bone, using as little water as possible and putting in season- 
ing of salt and pepper while the chicken is cooking. Drain 
off the liquor or gravy and take out the meat. Separate the 
white meat from the dark and chop both separately and very 
fine. In the dish in which you wish to mold the chicken lay 



POULTRY AND GAME 131 

the white meat, completing a layer on the bottom of the 
mold and pile the dark on top, or press the white meat to one 
side and the dark to the other side. Moisten the meat by 
pouring over it a little of the liquid in which it was cooked, 
lay a saucer, plate, or small board upon it, put on a weight 
and set away till the meat is cold and solid. 
Serve the chicken turned upon a platter. 

POTTED CHICKEN OR TURKEY 

Free the roast meat of a fowl from all bones. To every 
pound of meat add quarter of a pound of butter, pounding it 
in, and add little by little one teaspoon of mace, half a nut- 
meg, and cayenne pepper and salt to your taste. When you 
have worked all to a smooth paste, pack it in small glass or 
earthenware pots, and cover with clarified butter. Exclude 
all air by sealing the pots if you wish to keep the meat for 
any length of time, and set in a dry, airy place. 

A little boiled ham minced and oounded with the chicken 
gives added flavor, 

PRESSED CHICKEN 

Cook a fowl in just water enough to keep it from burn- 
ing until the meat loosens from the bones. After it has 
cooled pick it to pieces and mix the light and dark meat. 
Boil till hard two eggs, slice thin and add to the picked-up 
chicken. Boil down the water in which the chicken was 
cooked till it fills a small teacup. Add a little butter, pepper 
and salt. Mix all with the picked-up chicken, put in a mold 
or bowl, put on a weight to press, and set in a cool place. 
When time to serve, tip the chicken on a platter. 

CHICKEN WITH RED PEPPERS 

This is a Spanish receipt. It is good for using up left-over 
chicken. Boil three large red peppers until tender. Take 
out and throw away the seeds in which lie the strength of 
the peppers, add an onion, and chop fine with the peppers. 



132 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Mix two teaspoons of flour with two of butter, thin with 
half a cup or a small cup of milk. Bring to boil together 
with the minced peppers and add a cup of chicken chopped 
fine. Serve hot. 

REMNANTS OF COLD CHICKEN 

Cut the meat in small pieces as if for a salad. Rub a 
tablespoon of flour in a tablespoon of butter, add a table- 
spoon of minced onion and the same amount of parsley or 
minced celery, and stir all into a cup and a half of new 
milk heated in a double-boiler. When the milk thickens salt 
and pepper to taste, and stir in the diced chicken and let it 
heat through. Have small pieces of toast, put the chicken 
on the bread and serve. 

CHICKEN WITH RICE AND SAFFRON 

AN ITALIAN DISH 

Boil a six-pound chicken with two minced onions, one 
minced red pepper, and two minced sweet peppers. Boil 
until the jchicken is very tender. After removing the chicken 
add one pound of rice to the boiling broth. Boil for thirty 
minutes until the rice absorbs almost all the broth. Stir in 
one tablespoon of butter, one can of French mushrooms, and 
the minced cooked giblets. Add one heaping tablespoon of 
saffron powder, stirring through the rice. Pile the rice in 
a mound on a flat dish. Carve the chicken and lay in a bor- 
der about the rice. 

SPANISH CHICKEN 

Cut up as for fricassee a fowl, and put on to cook in hot 
water to cover it. Take a dozen dry red peppers, cut out 
the seed, and then jcut up and boil twenty minutes or half 
an hour till tender. When cooked moisten them with a 
little of the chicken broth and put through a sieve. In a 
saucepan in which you have a large spoon of hot lard slice 
two good-sized onions and let them fry. When brown add 



POULTRY AND GAME 133 

the peppers, and the chicken, which you have salted in its 
cooking and wliich must be thoroughly cooked and tender, 
and also add half a cup of the chicken broth. Thicken the 
rest of the broth, pour in the saucepan, and let the whole 
simmer over a gentle fire for fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Serve on a hot platter, 

STEWED CHICKEN WITH DUMPLING 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Cut the chicken for stewing, roll each piece in flour and 
brown in two tablespoons of hot dripping in a deep sauce- 
pan or casserole. Add quarter of a pound of lean boiled ham 
which you have cut in small pieces, one large minced onion, 
one bay leaf, two minced bell peppers, one minced red pep- 
per, half a teaspoon of rosemary, half a teaspoon of thyme, 
and a clove of minced garlic. 

Fill the 'casserole with water and allow all to simmer 
about two hours, until the water has cooked down to a rich 
gravy. Make the dumplings by creaming one teaspoon of 
butter with two beaten eggs. Add one teacup of flour and 
one teaspoon of baking powder. Mix to a soft dough, as soft 
as may be to roll out on the board. Roll and cut the dough 
in cubes one inch in size. Drop these cubes in the boiling 
stew fifteen minutes before serving. They will rise to cubes 
two inches in size. 

CHICKEN TERRAPIN 

A WASHINGTON DISH FOR FESTIVAL DAYS 

Boil two fowls until they are so tender that the meat 
parts readily from the bone when you stick in a fork. When 
the meat is cold cut it in small dice or squares. Heat a pint 
of milk in a double-boiler and to it add half a pound of 
butter into which you have rubbed and beaten two table- 
spoons of flour. Stir the butter and milk till boiling hot, 
take from the fire, and stir in half a teaspoon of salt, a dash 
of cayenne, a dash of nutmeg, and the yolks of six eggs. 



134 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

which you have previously well beaten. Put the diced chicken 
meat in a saucepan, pour the mixture over it, heat, but do not 
boil, and just before serving stir in a pint of sherry. A dish 
to go well with this is creamed potatoes. 

TO BONE A TURKEY 

Have a tender turkey, singe, draw, wash, and wipe it dry. 
Lay it before you, and have a sharp, narrow-pointed knife. 
Scrape the flesh from the bone ; do not cut it. Begin by going 
round the neck and shoulders and wings, taking off all the 
flesh from the bone, and pushing it before the knife as you 
proceed. Work the knife slowly and gradually, and do not 
break the skin. When the flesh has been completely cut from 
the bone, pull the neck and draw the whole skeleton out, leaving 
the flesh, which will be shapeless. 

Fill out the bird to its own size by stuffing the legs and 
wings, and then the body, with the following forcemeat. 
Tie and truss it for cooking, and follow the directions given 
under "Roast Turkey" for the roasting. 

STUFFING FOR BONED TURKEY 

Chop to a mince five hard-boiled eggs. To them add five 
slices of a ham which you have minced, and the slices of a 
whole tongue. Put in a few pieces of salt pickled pork and 
finish out with breadcrumbs. For seasoning you will need 
butter, salt and cayenne. If your taste permits it, use onions, 
thyme, sweet marjoram, celery seed, sweet basil, parsley, or 
other seasoning. 

TURKEY LOAF 

Cold turkey may be made up with cold ham, as described 
under "Veal Loaf.'' 

ROAST TURKEY 

Choose a fat turkey, draw and singe it. Save the giblets, 
that is the heart, liver and gizzard. Wash and clean them. 



POULTRY AND GAME 135 

and set over to boil. While they are cooking make the force- 
meat or stuffing. A common forcemeat for turkey is made 
of breadcrumbs, broken tine, well seasoned with salt and 
pepper, and, if your taste is pleased with it, also with sage. 
Butter should be added to give smoothness. When the gib- 
lets are tender — they may take some time to cook — take them 
from, the saucepan, put them in a chopping bowl, and mince. 
Add them to the breadcrumbs, and add also the little liquor 
in which they have been cooked. When you have thoroughly 
mixed the ingredients named above you have a good turkey 
stuffing or forcemeat. 

Now take your turkey, which has been washed in a little 
clear water and wiped dry, and fill the hole at the neck where 
the crop came out, and also the whole body of the turkey. 
Sew up the slits, using a large needle made for such pur- 
poses, or a large darning needle. Wind a clean white cord 
about the body to hold it in shape, and push up the legs 
close and high against the body. Press the neck gently 
down into and under the back. Rub the turkey over with 
butter, dredge it with salt and flour, set it in a dripping-pan, 
pour into the pan a pint of boiling water, and push it in a 
hot oven. With the liquor in the pan baste the turkey every 
fifteen minutes. Let it cook two hours and a half to three 
hours. The heat of the oven should be greater the first hour 
of the cooking. 

When the bird is cooked set it on a hot platter, and 
with the liquor which remains in the pan, seasoned as it is 
b}' the stuffing that has oozed out during the cooking and the 
juices of the meat, make a gravy by thickening with flour. 
Put the gravy in a separate dish. 

If the water cooks out of the pan during the roasting, 
add more water, always boiling hot. 

A turkey may be stuffed with forcemeats given on page 
137- Oysters stuff turkeys admirably. They should be well 
seasoned before being put in. Again, chestnuts boiled, peeled 
and mashed with butter make a good stuffing. In the South 
boiled sweet potatoes mashed with butter have been used. 



136 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

But the best all-round forcemeat is that of breadcrumbs 
seasoned and mixed with minced giblets. 

It is an old-fashioned country notion that a turkey gains 
in sweetness by being frosted after it is ready for stuffing, and 
in New England and the North generally it used to be the 
custom to prepare the bird the day before it was to be eaten 
— at Thanksgiving and Christmas — and hang it outdoors to 
be stiffened by the freezing air. 

TURKEY DRESSING 

A nine-pound turkey will require nearly two baker's loaves 
of bread for dressing. Cut off the crust from the four sides 
of the loaf. Crumble it coarse. Season with salt and pepper, 
being careful of the salt, as there is salt in the bread. Season 
high. Add one large beaten egg, and one heaping tablespoon 
of melted butter. Mix lightly with the hands. Add thyme 
for further seasoning. Thyme that comes in packages is bet- 
ter than that prepared in bottles. After the turkey is drawn, 
and the lights taken out and wiped dry, put in the dressing 
lightly by the handful without squeezing the bread. The open- 
ing should then be covered with pieces of the crust from the 
bread to keep the dressing dry. Fasten the opening together 
with skewers which come for thus purpose or sew it up. When 
the turkey is served take away the pieces of bread, and 
the dressing will be light and moist. No water should 
ever be used in this dressing. Water makes it soggy. All 
the moistening required will be found in the egg and melted 
butter. Turkey gravy should be thickened with browned flour, 
mixed in cold water: for a pint of gravy two heaping table- 
spoons of lightly browned flour mixed with water and made 
rather thick and smooth. Boil until the gravy thickens, and 
no more. Strain through a tin strainer or a tin skimmer. 

DUCK, PORK, AND OTHER DRESSINGS 

See under receipt headed "Turkey Dressing" about an ex- 
cellent receipt for dressings of all kinds. To duck dressing 



POULTRY AND GAME 137 

made after this direction add a slice of chopped pickled pork 
and chopped onion and sage or thyme. To pork dressing, 
add sage and onions. 

CHESTNUT STUFFING FOR TURKEY 

Shell two or more quarts of large chestnuts — those called 
French chestnuts. The quantity must accord with the size 
of your turkey. Drop them in boiling water and let them cook 
till the skins are loosened. Rub off the brown skins, drop 
into boiling salted water and cook till tender. Take from the 
water and rub at once through a colander. With the mashed 
nuts mix a handful or two of fine breadcrumbs, moisten to 
a paste with cream and melted butter, season with salt and pep- 
per and pack in your turkey. The forcemeat will swell, and 
therefore do not pack it in too tight. 

SAUSAGE STUFFING FOR TURKEY 
Crumble the bread with which you wish to stuff your turkey, 
moistening it with a little cold water. Add and mix in three- 
quarters of a pound of home-made or country-made sausage, 
a couple of tablespoons of melted butter, the juice of an onion, 
or the onion itself finely chopped, and three tart apples chopped 
fine. The sausage will have sage, but if you wish add a little 
more. Stir all together thoroughly, and force into the turkey. 

ROAST DUCK 

Singe, draw, and proceed as for "Roast Goose." 
Orange marmalade is a proper accompaniment for roast 
domestic duck. Serve with duck a rich brown sauce, into 
which, at the last moment, a tablespoon of orange marmalade 
has been stirred. 

ROAST GOOSE WITH APPLES 

A bread dressing seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, onions 
and sage can be used, or mashed potatoes seasoned with but- 
ter, salt, pepper and fried onions is favorably recommended. 



138 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Dredge the skin of the bird with flour and baste frequently. 
When serving, garnish with sUced apples stewed in salted water 
and pickled walnuts, oHves, or preserved oranges. [See 
illustration, Plate XII.] 

BROILED PARTRIDGE 

Singe and clean the birds and wipe dry with a cloth. Split 
up the back and press the breast bone flat. Rub the broiler 
with drippings and lay on the birds. Dip them in a sauce of 
melted butter several times while they are broiling. Allow 
twenty minutes for their broiling. Serve on a hot platter, 
laying maitre d'hotel sauce upon each bird. 

BROILED QUAIL 

Dress and rinse the quail in cold water, and wipe dry. 
Open them down the back. Lay them on a wire frame, set 
in a shallow pan, with the breast turned down. Cook on a gas 
stove, under the flame, and cook slowly. Dissolve two or three 
tablespoons of butter, with half a teacup of hot water, in a 
tin pie plate. While the quail are cooking turn them in this 
melted butter every five minutes, in order to baste and make 
them juicy. When cooked through, turn the birds over, and 
brown the breast a nice brown. Serve on a hot platter, and 
pour melted butter, seasoned with salt and pepper, over them. 
If served on toast, sprinkle a very small pinch of salt over the 
toast, and pour a little melted butter over it before laying the 
quail on it. If the quail are cooked on a stove, lay them on a 
wire broiler over the coals, with the breast turned up. Baste, 
and cook in the same way. 

BROILED PIGEONS 

Cut out the breasts of the pigeons, dip them in melted but- 
ter, then dip in breadcrumbs, and broil on a broiler over a 
clear fire. When done sprinkle with salt and pepper, and lay 
on pieces of brown toast. Serve with watercress. 



POULTRY AND GAME 139 

ENGLISH PIGEON PIE 

Clean four pigeons, then split in two down the back. Cut 
one pound of tenderloin pork into small cubes, arrange in a 
baking-dish with layers of onions, tomato catsup, parsley, pep- 
per and salt, a sprinkling of flour. Lay the pigeons on this 
so that the feet of two will protrude from the centre of the 
crust, dusting the birds with salt, pepper, and flour. Pour 
over half a pint of beef stock ; put a puff-paste cover on ; brush 
with beaten egg and bake about an hour and a half. This can 
be served either hot or cold. The legs of the birds must be 
scrubbed perfectly clean and the nails cut off close to the flesh. 
[See illustration, Plate XIII.] 

ROAST SNIPE 

After drawing and cleaning the birds, fill each one with a 
piece of well-buttered bread, seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Fasten a small piece of salt pork around each bird, catching 
it together with the bill. Place the birds on an earthen or en- 
ameled dripping-pan and very nearly cover with California 
port wine. To this add a tablespoon of butter. Baste every 
ten minutes, and bake half an hour in a steady oven. 

GAME PIE 

Stew one pound of venison cut in small pieces, one prairie 
chicken, one quail and two partridges until tender. Remove 
the meat from the bones, cutting in small pieces. Place these 
in browned butter and saute until browned on all sides, dredg- 
ing with flour. Strain the liquor and let stand in a cold place 
so the grease will rise and cake. Then remove it and return 
the liquor to a stewpan, add the meats, one tablespoon each 
of minced parsley and grated onion, twelve peppercorns, a 
quarter of a teaspoon of paprika and one teaspoon of salt. 
Stew until thick, then add one tablespoon of browned butter. 
Turn this mixture into a deep short-crust-lined dish, which has 
been previously baked, and set away until cold. The game 
mixture will be found jellied. Garnish with either watercress 



140 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

or parsley, and pickled walnuts are to be placed over the top. 
To be served cold. [See illustration, Plate XIII. ] 

JUGGED HARE 

Clean, skin and cut up one rabbit or hare into small pieces. 
Fry or saute. Brown in butter with one sliced onion. Then put 
into a wide-mouthed jar with one glass of port wine, twelve 
slices of bacon browned, a pinch of cinnamon, six cloves, one 
bay leaf, minced parsley and celery, and the juice of one 
lemon. Cover tightly and set in moderate oven for four 
hours. Half an hour before removing place forcemeat balls 
in jar and finish cooking. [See illustration, Plate XIV.] 

VENISON WITH GOOSEBERRY JELLY 

Put one venison steak through a mincer. Add the yolks of 
three eggs, salt, pepper and dry mustard to taste. Form into 
balls. Roll in flour and saute in hot butter. Heap on a hot 
dish and surround with gooseberry jelly. [See illustration, 
Plate XIV.]

ASPARAGUS SAUCE 

Cut asparagus tips into cubes, boil till tender in salted 
water, and add to white sauce in the proportion of one cup of 
the asparagus cubes to one cup of white sauce. Eaten with 
fish and fowl. 

BEEFSTEAK SAUCE 

A JEWISH RECEIPT 

In a hot saucepan put a piece of fat the size of an egg, and 
three sliced onions. Brown all together. Put half a cup of 
beef stock to the onions, thicken with a tablespoon of flour, 
add a tablespoon of mustard, a teaspoon of vinegar and a dash 
of cayenne, cook till the gravy thickens and serve with 
the steak. 

BREAD SAUCE 

Cook together in a double-boiler half a cup of fine white 
breadcrumbs, a small onion and a pint of milk. When smooth 
add a tablespoon of butter, half a teaspoon of salt, and a dash 
of white pepper. 



142 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BROWN SAUCE 

Together in a saucepan stir two tablespoons of butter and 
two tablespoons of flour until dark brown. Then add a pint 
of hot water, or a pint of brown stock, if you have it. Boil 
till thick and smooth. If the browning of the flour has made 
it lose its strength for thickening, add a tablespoon of 
unbrowned tlour to give the right thickness. Season to your 
taste with salt and black pepper, and add lemon-juice, catsup, 
or currant jelly, according to the flavor you wish. 

DRAWN BUTTER 

Mash together two large heaping tablespoons of butter 
and two heaping tablespoons of flour in a saucepan. When 
mixed, pour over and stir in half a pint of hot water. Dissolve 
and add salt to taste. Set this saucepan in another of hot water. 
Set over the fire and boil the water in the under saucepan 
very slowly, never fast at any time. Stir constantly to prevent 
lumping. The sauce must be perfectly smooth. Every now 
and then raise the upper pot from the water and stir hard. 
If more water is needed, add it. When the sauce is a creamy 
thickness to pour easily, take the saucepans from the fire and 
let them stand to keep the sauce warm until ready for use. 
Keep covered so no scum will form. Serve in a pitcher or 
gravy tureen. 

DRAWN BUTTER FOR FISH 
This sauce is made like "Egg Sauce" on page 144, leaving 
out the eggs. 

CAPER SAUCE 
Add one large spoon of capers to the "Drawn Butter" given 
above. 

CAULIFLOWER SAUCE 
Break in small pieces the tiny flowers of boiled cauli- 
flower and add a cup of the broken cauliflower to a cup of 
white sauce. 



SAUCES FOR FISH AND MEAT 143 

CELERY SAUCE 

Cut celery in small cubes, boil in salted water till tender, 
and add to white sauce, one cup of the cooked celery to one 
cup of white sauce. This is used for fowl, fish, and meat. 

CHEESE SAUCE 

Mix together a tablespoon of butter, a tablespoon of corn- 
starch, a large half cup of milk, and set to heat over a 
moderate fire, or in a double-boiler. When thoroughly hot, stir 
in half a pound of grated American cheese, quarter of a 
teaspoon of mustard, and quarter of a teaspoon of salt. When 
the cheese melts, stir in an egg well beaten, and serve at once. 
This sauce is eaten with boiled fish. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

Put a quart of cranberries in a porcelain kettle after you 
have looked them over and washed them. Add a cup of 
water and cook till the berries are soft. Put in a jelly bag 
to strain. Squeeze the bag to get out all the juice, add three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, boil ten minutes, and pour in 
the dish from which it is to be served, or in an earthen mold. 
Set away to chill and stiffen. See also under "Stewed Cran- 
berries," page 350. 

CUCUMBER SAUCE 

Peel and cut in cubes two medium-sized cucumbers. Set 
in a colander and while they are draining stir into six table- 
spoons of whipped cream a dash of cayenne, half a teaspoon 
of salt, six or eight drops of onion- juice and as much vinegar. 
Mix this sauce with the cucumbers and serve cold with fish 
or meat. 

AN EASY CURRY 

Slice six onions in a pint or more of whatever stock you 
have. Slice in also a sour apple and half a clove of garlic. 
Wet a teaspoon of curry powder with water and stir this in 



144 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the stock, adding salt and cayenne to taste. Cut any kind 
of cooked meat into small cubes or pieces, and simmer it till 
hot in the sauce. Serve in hot dish and on hot plates. 

A dish of rice may be served with this curry, or rice may 
be banked about a platter's edge and the curry of meat poured 
in the centre. 

EGG SAUCE 

To make egg sauce, have the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs crumble into small pieces, and add to the "Drawn But- 
ter" given on page 142. 

EGG SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH 

Boil two eggs from eight to twelve minutes. Then lay 
them in a pan of cold water. When they are cold peel off the 
shells and chop the eggs quite fine. Beat two heaping table- 
spoons of butter into one tablespoon of flour and one teaspoon 
of salt. When the butter and flour are well mixed pour over 
them a coffee-cup of boiling water. Cook the sauce two or 
three minutes till the flour thickens, stir in the chopped eggs 
and serve. Pepper may be dusted over the sauce when it is 
ready to serve. 

HORSERADISH SAUCE 

Wash clean roots of horseradish and scrape off the outside. 
Grate the roots on a large grater. Put the grated horseradish 
in a china or glass — not a metal — dish and moisten with good 
cider vinegar. Do not add enough vinegar to make it liquid. 

This sauce is most excellent with plain boiled beef. 

HOT HORSERADISH SAUCE 

In an earthen dish put four tablespoons of fresh grated 
horseradish and four tablespoons of finely powdered cracker 
or bread crumbs. Add half a cup of cream, a teaspoon each 
of sugar and of salt, two dashes of pepper, two teaspoons of 
vinegar and a teaspoon of made mustard. Set over a kettle 



SAUCES FOR FISH AND MEAT 145 

of boiling water when you have stirred all together. Heat 
and serve hot with plain boiled beef or corned beef. 

JELLY SAUCE 

Another receipt follows the "Brown Sauce," given on page 
142. When you have made a brown sauce stir in a third of 
a cup of currant jelly. 

JELLY SAUCE FOR MEATS 

In an earthen or porcelain saucepan melt over a slow 
fire a tumbler of some jelly — either currant or grape — and 
when it is melted and warm stir in a tablespoon of butter. Let 
all come to boil, pour into the hot dish in which it is to be 
served, add a tablespoon of claret or other red wine and serve 
at once. The sauce goes well with mutton and lamb. 

MAITRE D'HOTEL SAUCE 
Beat three tablespoons of butter till it creams. Add the 
juice of a small lemon, quarter of a teaspoon of salt, a dash 
of cayenne, and three teaspoons of minced parsley. 

This sauce is an agreeable addition to broiled chicken, fish, 
etc., and is referred to under various receipts. 

MINT SAUCE 

This is a relish with roast lamb — with which meat alone it 
is eaten. By some tastes it is much liked. Not every one 
agrees with the Englishman who, when mint sauce was 
passed him, said, "Thank you, I never eat smells." 

Be sure your mint is fresh and green and fair. Wash it, 
strip the leaves from the stems and mince them fine. Put the 
mince in a bowl and mix with it gradually clear cider vinegar 
not too strong. If the vinegar is very strong, it is better to 
dilute it, even to using half water, for sharp vinegar destroys 
the mint aroma. Add also a teaspoon of sugar to a tablespoon 
of the minced mint. Have your sauce about as thick as horse- 
radish when all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed in. 

7 Vol. 2 



146 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Serve from a small dish with a teaspoon or ladle. A spoon 
of this sauce is laid on the rim of the plate and a pinch of 
it taken with the meat. 

OLIVE SAUCE 
Add to "Brown Sauce," on page 142, three-quarters of a 
cup of pickled olives, stoned and chopped. 

ONION SAUCE 

First peel and then chop fine a quart of onions. Melt in a 
saucepan a heaping tablespoon of butter and into the hot but- 
ter drop the minced onions and gently cook till tender. Season 
with white pepper and salt, and stir in two tablespoons of 
fiour. Last, add a cup of cream, bring to boil and put 
through a sieve. 

This same sauce may be served with cold mutton, and as 
a delicious relish for many other meats. 

SAGE-AND-ONION SAUCE 
Take a bunch of fresh sage leaves picked from the stems. 
Wash and put in boiling water with just enough water to 
cover them. Boil ten minutes. Then drain and chop small. 
Meanwhile, have boiling in another pan two good-sized onions. 
When they are tender mince them and mix with the minced 
sage. Stir together with a tablespoon of fresh butter and 
serve with roast goose, roast duck, or roast pork. Into the 
sauce may be stirred some of the gravy of the meat with which 
it is served. This moistens the sauce and improves it. 

ONION-JUICE FOR SEASONING 

Peel, cut the onion in small pieces, and press in a lemon 
squeezer which you use for no other purpose but squeezing 
onions. Only a few drops of onion- juice are needed at a time 
in salads, meat sauces, etc., and with a little glass squeezer at 
hand it is readily obtained. If the pieces of the onion squeeze 
out, tie the onion in a piece of damp cheesecloth. 



SAUCES FOR FISH AND MEAT 147 

Or if you have not a squeezer, use this method of expressing 
the juice: Take the dry layers off the onions, hack the juicy 
layers with a dull silver knife. Press the onion hard with the 
blade, and the juice will drip from the blade. 

Or this method : Hold a tin grater over your salad, and on 
it turn about an onion you have peeled. Press hard and the 
juice will drip. 

SAUCE TARTARE 

After you have made a mayonnaise, add a tablespoon of 
chopped cucumber pickle, a few capers, a few chopped olives, 
stir or beat, and if too thick thin with vinegar. 

TOMATO SAUCE 

Take a pint of canned tomatoes, add an onion well scraped 
or minced, half a teaspoon of salt and half as much pepper as 
salt, and put together in a saucepan over the fire. After cook- 
ing gently fifteen or twenty minutes, add two tablespoons of 
butter into which you have cooked a heaping tablespoon of 
.flour until it has become smooth. Add the butter to the toma- 
toes slowly, let it cook gently for a few minutes, rub through 
a sieve or fine colander and serve hot. 

WHITE SAUCE 

To a tablespoon of melted butter beat a tablespoon of flour, 
half a teaspoon of salt and an eighth of a teaspoon of white 
pepper. A quarter of a teaspoon of onion- juice, or half a 
teaspoon of chopped onion, may also be added, but is not an 
essential. Over all well mixed pour a cup of creamy milk, 
or stock, adding it little by little over a hot fire, as the sauce 
thickens. The sauce should be smooth. If it is not, strain it.

SALAD MATERIALS 

THE salad maker has a wide range of materials from 
which to compound her appetizing and wholesome dish. 
Its possibilities include not only nearly all vegetables and fruits, 
but also flesh, fish, fowl, and nuts in great variety. 

For the hot days the limit should extend no further than 
the succulent vegetables and fruits. The other foods are too 
rich in heat-producing properties for this purpose. If one 
keeps comfortably cool during warm weather the diet must 
be cut down, at least that part of it which contributes to the 
animal heat of the body. 

Nothing of questionable quality should enter into the com- 
position of a salad. The vegetables or fruit, as the case may 
be, should not only be fresh and without the slightest blemish 
to mar the flavor and looks, but crisp, cold, and refreshing. 

When uncooked vegetables are used, after being thoroughly 
cleansed with very cold water, they should be dried in a soft 
towel without crushing and kept in a cold place until needed. 

For the dressing, genuine olive oil should be used ; and the 
vinegar must be pure, that made from tarragon herbs being 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 149 

best for the purpose, furnishing, in addition to the acid neces- 
sary for the eniulsification and assimilation of the oil, an agree- 
able flavor to the dressing. 

A summer salad should never be dressed with any more 
elaborate preparation than a mixture of oil and vinegar or 
lemon- juice, seasoned with salt and pepper — a very simple 
compound ; yet, according to the Spanish proverb, requiring 
four persons to make it : a spendthrift to bring the oil, a 
miser the vinegar, a man of judgment the seasoning, and a 
madman to do the stirring when mixed with the salad. Very 
good proportions for this dressing — French dressing, it is 
called — are : Four tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of 
vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt, and one-eighth of a teaspoon 
of white pepper. 

To blend these ingredients properly, that all may be incor- 
porated, yet no peculiar flavor predominate, mix the salt and 
pepper ; add one tablespoon of oil ; mix well ; add half a table- 
spoon of vinegar; blend. Then add the remainder of the oil, 
a few drops at a time, alternately with the vinegar. Variety 
may be furnished by the addition of a little lemon-juice or a 
few drops of the essence of anchov}^ If onion flavor is liked, 
rub the salad bowl while empty with a garlic clove or a bit of 
onion. Use only a wooden spoon for salad dressings. 

To those who prefer tickling the palate to catering to the 
digestive apparatus of the inner man, this French dressing does 
not appeal, something more elaborate being demanded. In such 
homes the housewife will do well to become familiar with the 
following formula, for two reasons — it is a really good dress- 
ing; then, too, it will keep indefinitely in a cool place. 

AMERICAN BEAUTY SALAD 
Soak one ounce of gelatine half an hour in enough cold 
watisr to cover it. Bring to boil one slice of onion, a bay 
leaf, and half a teaspoon of celery seed in one pint of cold 
water. Add half a cup of rich stock, two table«poons of 
lemon-juice, season with salt and pepper, add gelatine, and 
strain. Half fill individual molds with cold cooked beet. 



150 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

turnip, and potato cubes. Fill up with the jelly colored red 
with vegetable coloring. Garnish with green and serve with 
mayonnaise. 

ASPARAGUS SALAD 

Boil asparagus till tender, or use canned asparagus, some 
of which is excellent. Cut off all the hard and inedible portion, 
lay the asparagus in a salad bowl, having the tips all one way ; 
pour over a French dressing, and serve thoroughly cold, put- 
ting each individual portion on a lettuce leaf if you have the 
lettuce at hand. 

BANANA SALAD 

Red bananas are preferable to the yellow for all uses, and 
especially for this salad. Peel and cut the fruit in small 
pieces and, if you have it, add pineapple cut in small pieces, 
and also strawberries. Squeeze out and mix the juice of two 
oranges and one lemon, add sugar to t'aste — not enough to 
make it sweet — and pour over the cut bananas and other 
fruit., Chill and serve cold. The fruit juice is daintier if 
flavored with a tablespoon of wine and a teaspoon of brandy, 
but the everyday use of such flavorings we do not recom- 
mend. 

BAKED BEAN SALAD 

Take two cups of baked beans and put over them a mixture 
made of one tablespoon of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, 
one tablespoon of oil, two tablespoons of minced onion and one 
tablespoon of chopped celery. 

STRING-BEAN SALAD 

String and break young beans and their pods into half-inch 

lengths. Cook tender in salted water. Drain, add a little 

chopped onion, pile in lettuce cups, dress with French dressing, 

and garnish with tiny beet cubes. [See illustration, Plate XV.] 

NEW BEET SALAD 
The new beets must be thoroughly boiled — nothing is worse 
in the wav of food than a half -cooked beet. When done cut 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 151 

them while hot in rather thin sHces and marinate them — that 
is, let them lie for an hour or two in a mixture of two table- 
spoons oil, one spoon vinegar, and a small pinch of salt. More 
than this must be used if there is to be a large dish of salad. 
When ready for serving put them in the salad dish with some 
very young and tender leaves of uncooked dandelion. Dress 
with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper of the French dressing. 

CABBAGE SALAD 

Chop white cabbage fine and mix it with a thin mayonnaise 
dressing. Set it where it will keep cool, and serve on a lettuce 
leaf with or without chopped nuts. Pass cheese wafers with 
this salad. 

COLD SLAW 

Select a firm white head of cabbage. Cut out the core, 
chop it even and quite fine. In chopping take out the hard 
pieces. This slaw should always be chopped, not shaved. 
For the dressing break two eggs into a small saucepan. Put 
into them one heaping teaspoon of salt, one heaping teaspoon 
of sugar, not quite half an even teaspoon of mustard and two 
dashes of black pepper. Stir this together and beat the egg a 
little. In order not to cook the egg, add gradually (stirring 
all the time) a little less than half a teacup of vinegar. If the 
vinegar is sharp, weaken it by pouring in a little water. Stir 
all together. Set the saucepan into another containing warm 
water. Let the water gradually come to boil. Stir constantly 
with a tablespoon, to prevent the eggs curdling. Cook until it 
is quite thick. This done, take it from the water. Add one 
dash of cayenne pepper if you like it, and one scant tablespoon 
of olive oil, one teaspoon of butter, and one tablespoon and a 
half of rich milk or cream. Stir all together. Pour this dress- 
ing over two full teacups of chopped cabbage, and mix. 

Celery is a very nice addition, for variety. Take about four 
stalks of nice white celery, scrape, wash in cold water, and dry 
it. Slice in thin slices, and mix with the cabbage. This dish 
is better if it stands a few hours before serving. 



152 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

CREAM COLD SLAW 

Soak in cold water, to ensure its crispness, a head of cab- 
bage, shave in small strips, and pour over, mixing in well, a 
dressing made in the following way. Beat together two eggs, 
a tablespoon of mustard and two tablespoons of sugar. Add 
a tablespoon of butter, two tablespoons of vinegar, salt and 
pepper to taste, and four tablespoons of sour cream at the last. 
Stir vigorously, and when you pour over the cabbage mix it 
in well. 

HOT SLAW 

Select a hard white head of cabbage. Cut it in half. Shave 
it ofif with a slaw-cutter or a sharp knife in very trim strips. 
Make the dressing as follows : In a small saucepan put one 
egg, into w'hich beat one even teaspoon of salt, one even tea- 
spoon of sugar, one-quarter (scant) of a teaspoon of mustard 
and one dash of red pepper to taste. Mix together and beat 
a little. Set the saucepan in another in which there is warm 
water. Let it :come gradually to boil. Stir constantly to prevent 
lumping. When it thickens a very little take it off and add 
one tablespoon of cream. Pour it over the slaw hot. This 
may be eaten cold as well as hot. 

CARROT SALAD 

Cook richly colored carrots in boiling water till soft. Cut 
into thin strips. Arrange in lettuce cups, sprinkle with sifted 
sugar, dress with French dressing, and garnish with sliced 
lemon. [See illustration, Plate XV.] 

CAULIFLOWER SALAD 

Cold boiled cauliflower may be made into a deHcious salad. 
Break the head into small pieces, keeping the flower-like look 
as much as possible, and serve with a French dressing or a 
mayonnaise. If you have lettuce leaves, serve the cauliflower 
on them. 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 153 

CELERY SALAD 

In keeping celery overnight, do not wrap it in wet paper 
or set it in a bowl of water. Put it where the air is pure and 
cool. To prepare it for serving, break oflf the stalks from the 
root, wash each one clean in cold water, scrape off the yellow 
brown where the stalk is abraded, lay in a dish with pieces 
of ice, and keep cold till served. The root of the celery should 
be preserved for soups, for which it is most desirable. 

CELERY AND HICKORY-NUT SALAD 

Cut in small dice the white stem of the celery. Add a 
few broken meats of the hickory-nut, and serve with a French 
dressing. 

CELERY, APPLE, AND HICKORY-NUT SALAD 

Use tart apples, and equal quantities of the apples, celery, 
and hickor}'-nut meats. Serve with a mayonnaise or French 
dressing. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

Split two chickens down the back. Wash them thor- 
oughly in cold water, wipe dry. Put them in a granite pre- 
serving kettle, cover with boiling water slightly salted. Boil 
until very tender. Cut or pull the chicken from the bones. 
Cut off all gristle and take away the skin. Chop the meat 
very coarse and even. Add to the chicken white cabbage 
chopped very fine, finer than for slaw, and in the proportion 
of one-third of cabbage. Take one bunch or one bunch and 
a half of white celery. Scrape, wash, and lay in cold water 
a short time. For the dressing, break six eggs into a sauce- 
pan. Mix three heaping teaspoons of salt, three heaping 
teaspoons of sugar, four dashes of black pepper, and one 
even teaspoon of mustard dissolved in cold water and stirred 
smooth. Stir these together and add to the egg, heating a 
little. Pour very gradually over the egg one teacup and 
one-quarter of vinegar, stirring constantly to prevent the 



164 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

egg from cooking. If the vinegar is sharp, weaken it with 
a little water. Now set the saucepan in another containing 
water. Let the -mixture gradually come to boil. Stir con- 
stantly to prevent the egg curdling, and lift often from the 
water and stir hard to prevent it so doing. Let the mixture 
be very smooth. When quite thick take the saucepan from 
the water. Add one tablespoon and a half of butter to the 
thickened dressing, three tablespoons of very rich cream and 
two dashes of red pepper. Cut the celery into pieces one- 
quarter of an inch thick. Wipe the celery dry before slicing 
it. Mix it through the chicken. Pour the dressing over the 
chicken, and make it moist and creamy. If it stands some 
time it will absorb the dressing and be a little dry. Keep 
any dressing left to add, if needed. After the salad is mixed 
with the dressing, add three tablespoons of olive oil. Stir 
again and taste ; if more red pepper, cream, or oil is needed, 
add it. Let stand a few hours before serving. 

THE JUDGE'S CHICKEN SALAD 
, . Free from skin and fat the meat of two large boiled 
chickens. Cut the meat in cubes or dice and mix with it the 
same quantity of crisp celery cut in similar pieces. Add 
five minced olives and three teaspoons of capers. Make a 
dressing of six tablespoons of oil, two tablespoons of vine- 
gar, two teaspoons of salt, and a dash of cayenne. Mix the 
dressing with the chicken and celery and set in the refrige- 
rator several hours to chill. 

Prepare the mayonnaise given below, make a smooth 
pile of the chicken in a salad bowl, pour the mayonnaise over 
and serve at once. 

MAYONNAISE FOR CHICKEN SALAD 
To the yolks of two eggs add drop by drop a pint of 
olive oil, stirring with a silver fork one way all the time. 
When the dressing thickens, thin with lemon-juice, keeping 
jt all the time about as thick as thick cream. Add salt and 
pepper to taste. 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 155 

TO PREPARE CUCUMBERS 

Select only medium-sized and well-shaped cucumbers. Half 
an hour before they are required, peel and slice them evenly, 
and not too thin. Lay in a tin pan, cover with cold water, add 
no salt, as it wilt's the cucumber, and put a large piece of ice 




A Cucumber Slicer 

into the water. Set the pan on the ice until ready for the 
table. Then pour off the ice and water, and serve. You will 
find them crisp and nice, prepared in this way. 

CUCUMBER SPIRALS 

Peel cucumbers and throw into ice water. Cut the chilled 
cucumber with a sharp knife, going round and round it till you 
have thin, long spirals. Lay in a salad bowl with cracked or 
shaved ice, and serve with the spirals French dressing. 

DANDELION SALAD 

Early in the spring young dandelions, very tender and fresh, 
are by many deemed a delicious and wholesome salad. The 
early root leaves are mostly white. Wash the leaves, separate 
them, and serve with a French dressing. See also "Dande- 
lion Greens," page i86. 

FISH SALAD 

Sometimes you have a piece of fish left from dinner, such 
fish as fresh cod, halibut, bass, red snapper. On such occa- 
sion keep it cold near ice till next day and make a delicious 
salad in this way: Free it from bone and skin, break it in 
small pieces, and in a bowl which you have rubbed with a 
juicy onion put a layer of the fish. Over this sprinkle salt 



156 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and lemon- juice, and lay on crisp white lettuce leaves. Dress 
the lettuce as you have the layer of fish, and then add more 
fish, which again you treat as you treated the first layer. 
So proceed till you have used your material. Spread over 
the top a layer of tartare sauce, chill, and serve. 

FISH SALAD 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Made from two pounds of cold boiled fish, or fish left 
over. Pick the meat free of bones, lay it in a china bowl, 
add four cloves, as many allspice, one minced red pepper, 
half a teaspoon of salt, and one teaspoon of minced parsley. 
Also add the juice of one lemon, one teacup of olive oil, 
stirring this in slowly, half a teacup of cider vinegar, one 
teaspoon of French mustard, and one small white onion 
minced exceedingly fine. Let this stand near ice overnight^ 
and serve cold with lettuce or any salad green. 

FRENCH FRUIT SALAD 

Peel and cut into small pieces three oranges, three 
bananas, and an equivalent amount of pineapple. Fill lettuce 
cups with alternate layers of fruit. Dress with salad dress- 
ing, garnish with English walnut meats, and serve with 
cheese wafers. [See illustration, Plate XVI.] 

MACEDOINE SALAD 

Cut cooked turnips, carrots, and celery into small pieces. 
Add cooked peas, beans, and cauliflower, also broken in 
small pieces. Moisten with mayonnaise and let stand two 
hours. Scoop out small turnips, cook, and fill the shells with 
the salad. Serve on lettuce leaves. Cheese wafers are 
served with this salad. 

ORANGE SALAD 
Choos'e large, juicy, clean-skinned oranges. Cut each 
orange through the middle, and with a teaspoon scoop out 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 157 

the pulp carefully, breaking it as slightly as possible. Lay 
the pulp on ice. With a sharp knife pare out the white pith 
on the inner part. Cut a thin slice from the end of each 
half to allow it to set firmly on the plate. When ready to 
serve sprinkle the pulp with powdered sugar, add a table- 
spoon of sherry to each tablespoon of orange-juice, and pour 
over the orange pulp. Heap the halves of the oranges full 
of the salad, garnish with white grapes and serve. 

OYSTER SALAD 

Beat together half a cup of cream and three eggs. Add 
a saltspoon of made mustard, salt and cayenne to taste, and 
two tablespoons of butter. Heat in a double-boiler, stir con- 
stantly, and when at boiling point two minutes add two 
tablespoons of vinegar. Cook two minutes more, and you 
then have a smooth sour cream. Have a quart of oysters 
merely brought to boil in their own liquor and cooled. Have 
also a pint of chopped celery. Mix the celery and oysters, 
pour over and mix in the cream dressing, and keep the salad 
cool till served. 

PINEAPPLE SALAD 

Be sure your pines are ripe and tender. Shred them 
thoroughly. Then add orange and lemon juice in the pro- 
portions given in the foregoing. Sugar to taste, and set 
away to chill. 

POTATO SALAD 

Boil six medium-sized potatoes until very tender, with 
salt in the water. Take each from the saucepan with a spoon 
to prevent breaking. Put them in a colander, and set aside 
until cold. When cold, cut them in somewhat thin slices 
across the potato. Lay in an earthen dish and sprinkle with 
parsley chopped very fine. Make the following dressing: 
Mix in a small saucepan four eggs, two heaping teaspoons 
of salt, two heaping teaspoons of sugar, one small teaspoon 
of mustard, and four dashes of pepper. Stir this together, 



158 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and heat a little to mix well. Add gradually three-quarters 
of a teacup of vinegar. Set the saucepan in another con- 
taining water. Let the water come gradually to boil. Stir 
constantly with a tablespoon until the dressing is qaite thick. 
Be careful not to let the egg curdle. Lift it now and then 
from the hot water, and stir, to prevent the curdling. When 
done take from the water and add two dashes of red pepper, 
one tablespoon of butter, three tablespoons of sweet milk or 
cream, and one-quarter of a teaspoon of onion- juice. Pour 
the dressing over the potatoes and carefully mix through. 
When done, the dressing should look creamy. If this quan- 
tity of dressing is not enough to make the salad moist, make 
more in the same proportion. Let the salad stand a few 
hours before serving, 

RADISHES AS SALAD 

Wash young, tender radishes in cold water, and cut off the 
tops to within an inch or three-quarters of an inch of the root. 
Sometimes one or two leaves are left about two and a half 
inches long to save a stubby appearance and to take hold of the 
radish by. Put the radishes in ice water to cool and crisp, 
and serve lying on small pieces of ice in a flat' dish. Do not 
peel the small button radish, but the long, large radish should 
be peeled and sliced in long slices. Dip the radish in salt, or 
a mixture of salt and pepper, as you eat. 

SPINACH SALAD 

After you have thoroughly washed the spinach, cook it in 
just enough water to keep it from sticking. Drop it into boiling 
water for the cooking. After it has boiled fifteen minutes salt 
the water, let boil five or ten minutes longer till it is tender, 
then tip into a colander to drain. After it has drained chop 
very fine and season with a little butter, pepper, and salt if 
your taste needs it, and pack in individual shells or cups. Chill 
in the ice-box and serve with a French dressing. If you pack 
it in shells vou will not wish to disturb it, but serve it in its 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 159 

dish. If packed in cups as a mold, tip out on a lettuce leaf, and 
serve with the French dressing. 

SWEETBREAD SALAD 

After you have trimmed off the fat from fresh sweet- 
breads, wash in cold water and drop in boiling water enough 
to cover. Let them simmer till thoroughly parboiled, which 
will take about half an hour. Take from the water, cool, 
use a silver or wooden fork, and break in small pieces. Lay 
on crisp white lettuce leaves, and serve with a French 
dressing. 

TOALATO SALAD 

Strain one pint of tomato- juice, add one teaspoon of salt, a 
saltspoon of pepper, and one teaspoon of onion- juice. To this 
add a quarter of a box of gelatine. Put aside for half an hour 
to dissolve. Stir all together, put on the stove, let come to boil, 
take ofif, and pour into small cup (glass, or any other, that 
would be about the size of a tomato). Set it in a cold place 
to harden. Arrange two or three small lettuce leaves on a 
plate, turn the tomato jelly in the centre of the leaves, and use 
French or any other dressing. [See illustration, Plate XVL] 

STUFFED TOMATO SALAD 
Carefully scald and remove the skins from medium-sized, 
firm tomatoes. Stand them in pouiided ice until thoroughly 
chilled. Take out the seeds without breaking the fruit. Fill 
the tomatoes with chopped cucumber and cress; dress with 
Frenich dressing and serve on lettuce leaves. 

RED AND YELLOW TOMATO SALAD 
' Peel red and yellow tomatoes, slice, and lay in alternate 
layers, and serve with French dressing or with a mayonnaise. 

TOMATO AND CAULIFLOWER SALAD 
Peel and slice ripe tomatoes. In a salad dish or bowl lay 
a slice of tomato and on this a few crumbs of scraped onion. 



160 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Next lay in pieces of cold boiled cauliflower and upon this put 
a little scraped onion. So make the layers till the dish is full. 
Over all pour a French dressing and set in ice-box to chill 
before eating. 

TOMATO JELLY 

In an earthen saucepan put a fine-chopped onion. Let it 
brown, then open a small can of tomatoes and pour in. Add 
also a stalk of celery broken in small pieces, a bay leaf, a large 
spoon of wine or cider vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt, and a 
dash of pepper or paprika. In quarter of a cup of cold water 
have dissolved half a cup of gelatine. Add this to the toma- 
toes, stir till all is thoroughly blended, and strain into a mold. 
If you mold the jelly so that it has an open centre, you can fill 
it in with a salad of cabbage, with nuts, or with any vegetable 
salad which will go well with it. 

TUXEDO SALAD WITH DRESSING 

Place one can of tomatoes in a saucepan over the fire, 
add one teaspoon each of butter, salt, and sugar, one-quarter 
of a teaspoon of pepper, and cook ten minutes. Then pour 
the tomatoes into a sieve, rub them through, and return them 
to the saucepan. Soak one ounce of gelatine in half a cup 
of cold water until soft. Add this to the tomatoes, stir over 
the fire until dissolved, then pour into a mold and set in a 
cool place until firm. 

Make a mayonnaise by putting the yolks of two eggs 
into a small double-boiler; add two tablespoons each of 
salad oil and white vinegar. Stir over the fire until this 
thickens, then remove at once, and when cold add slowly 
two more tablespoons of oil, stirring constantly. Add half 
a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of sugar, and three-quarters 
of a cup of whipped cream. 

Put one cup each of fine-cut white celery and fine-cut 
fresh pineapple into a bowl. Cook one cup of pecan meats 
ten minutes in salted water; drain, break the meats into 
small pieces, and add them to the mixture in the bowl. Mix 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 161 

this with half the mayonnaise, iinmold the tomato into a 
round dish, put the salad in the centre, and garnish with 
pineapple leaves and thin slices of pineapple, cut with a 
scalloped cutter into crescent shapes. [For illustration, see 
Plate XVIL] 

FANCY VEGETABLE SALAD WITH DRESSING 

Scrape, wash, and cut into long slices one good-sized 
carrot ; lay several slices over one another, and cut them into 
small strips like straws. Place the carrots in a saucepan, 
cover with boiling water, add half a teaspoon of sugar and 
cook until tender. Drain and set aside to cool. Cook half a 
pint of green peas in water with a little salt ; when done, 
drain and add them to the carrots. Add to these half a pint 
of fine-cut boiled potatoes, half a pint of finely shaved cab- 
bage, two fine-cut boiled beets, and three fine-cut hard- 
boiled eggs. Make the salad dressing as follows : Put the 
yolks of three eggs into a bowl, set in cracked ice, stir three 
minutes, adding slowly one cup of oil while stirring con- 
stantly. Then add one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of 
English mustard, and, as the dressing thickens, add slowly 
one tablespoon of white vinegar, one tablespoon of fine- 
chopped onion and capers, one tablespoon of tarragon vine- 
gar, and half a pint of whipped cream. IVIix half of this 
dressing with the vegetables, dress the salad in the centre of 
a salad dish, cover it with the remaining dressing, and 
garnish with fine-Chopped beets, the whites of hard-boiled 
eggs, caviare, and put a small bunch of chives in the centre. 
[For illustration, see Plate XVIL] 

WALDORF SALAD 
This is one of the cheapest of all salads. It requires sour, 
crisp apples, cut in thin slices, and finely chopped celery. 
Blend lightly with a fine oil mayonnaise, garnish with the 
blanched feathery tops of the celery and scatter with halves 
of English walnuts. See "The Boon of an Apple Barrel," 
page 345- 



102 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

WATERCRESS SALAD 

Pick out sprightly, young cresses. Break off the bruised 
and yellowed leaves, and wash in several waters, so that it is 
freed from all dust, sand, clinging insects, and also from any 
typhoid fever germs. Remember that watercress grows in 
small country streams, where the water is sometimes sluggish, 
and there is chance of its being contaminated by bad drainage. 
Drop the cress lightly in a salad bowl and pour over it French 
dressing. Toss it with a wooden fork and spoon till all 
parts of the cress have taken up the dressing and serve cold. 

CREAM SALAD DRESSING 

Bring to boil in an earthen dish half a cup of vinegar, a tea- 
spoon of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper. Beat well the 
yolks of two eggs, gradually add the hot vinegar, stir, and 
also add three tablespoons of oil or butter, half a tablespoon 
of mustard, a teaspoon of sugar, and, lastly, six tablespoons 
of cream. Keep up a vigorous stirring as each ingredient 
is added. 

MILD CREAM DRESSING 

A mild cream dressing adds a relishing finish to vegetable 
salads and is preferred by many persons to a more piquant 
one. To make it, heat one cup of cream almost to boiling ; stir 
in one teaspoon of flour, wet up with a little cold milk or 
water ; boil two minutes, stirring constantly ; add two table- 
spoons of powdered sugar, stir well, then take off the fire. 
When half cold, beat in the whipped whites of two eggs; set 
on ice until quite cold; then season with one teaspoon of salt, 
half as much black pepper, and a small quantity of prepared 
mustard. Beat the whole thoroughly ; then whip in two table- 
spoons of salad oil or soft butter. Just before pouring the 
dressing over the salad add, gradually, three tablespoons of 
vinegar. 

Unless salads are mixed at table — which is often done when 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 163 

the French dressing is used — they present a more inviting ap- 
pearance if arranged at once for individual serving instead 
of being dished the second time. 

Next in importance to the making of a salad ranks its gar- 
nishings. How a dish looks exerts a wonderful influence upon 
the appetite. For this purpose one may use fringed celery 
stalks, fresh lettuce leaves, hard-boiled eggs, blood beets 
(boiled, then cut into various shapes), nasturtiums, powdered 
tarragon leaves, and the kernels of English walnuts. 

SOUR CREAM DRESSING 

To a cup of fresh sour cream allow a tablespoon of lemon- 
juice. Add to the juice, salt, cayenne pepper, and dry mus- 
tard to your taste. Stir these four ingredients together and 
then beat into the cup of cream till the cream puffs. Pour 
over the cold salad green and serve at once. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

Select a small bowl for the table, put into it one saltspoon 
of salt, a dash of pepper, a little dry mustard, and one saltspoon 
of sugar. To this add, gradually, a tablespoon of olive oil, 
stirring, to dissolve the ingredients. Stir smooth, and add two 
more tablespoons of olive oil, and one tablespoon of vinegar. 
Red pepper can be used if preferred, also more seasoning, if 
the taste requires. 

HORSERADISH DRESSING 

Mix three tablespoons of fresh grated horseradish with a 
tablespoon of vinegar or of lemon- juice and a pinch of salt. 
Then stir in three tablespoons of whipped cream and a dash 
of cayenne. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Take two ice-cold eggs and separate the yolks from the 
whites. Into the yolks stir a third of a teaspoon of salt and a 
dash of pepper, and, drop by drop, olive oil, stirring continu- 



164 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

onsly. You have now a thick mass ; add a few drops of lemon- 
juice or vinegar, and stir ; then oil again and stir, then lemon- 
juice or vinegar, till you have the quantity and consistency 
you wish. If it is to your taste, add onion-juice or half a tea- 
spoon of made mustard, or a drop or two of mint. The lemon- 
juice or vinegar is the thinning ingredient, and constant stir- 
ring is essential to successful making of the dressing. Set 
on the ice, and just before serving add a tablespoon of whipped 
or plain thick cream. The yolk of a hard-boiled egg may 
also be beaten in with the cream. To make the yolk smooth 
rub it first through a sieve, and then stir into the dressing. 
This dressing is dropped with a small spoon on peeled 
tomatoes, lettuce, asparagus, chicken, and is a heartier salad 
dressing than French dressing.

Potatoes 

TO BAKE POTATOES 

CHOOSE smooth potatoes, of equal size so far as may be, 
and large, for a small potato baked is apt to be nothing 
but skin. Wash the potatoes clean, dry with a cloth, chip off 
the skin at either end to allow the steam to escape and help to 
the potatoes' mealiness, put in a hot oven and bake, allowing 
from forty to sixty minutes for the roasting. The difference 
in the quality of potatoes, and difference in size, and also in 
the temperature of the oven, require considerable latitude in 
the time for cooking. 

TO BOIL NEW POTATOES 
Use a coarse cloth for rubbing off the skin of the pota- 
toes. While washing, cut a small piece from the ends of 
each potato to help to their boiling. Drop them in boiling 
water without salt and boil till done. They may be served 
whole and plain to eat with butter, or a cream dressing may 
be made by pouring new milk on the cooked potatoes, and 
thickening the milk with a tablespoon or two of flour — the 
flour used according to the quantity of the milk, a tablespoon 
to a pint of milk. To the milk add salt to your taste. 

BOILED POTATOES 

After you have peeled and rinsed in cold water potatoes of 
moderate size put them in a kettle of boiling water. Have 



Xm THE HOME COOK BOOK 

enough water to cover the potatoes and put them in about 
three-quarters of an hour before they are to be served. Cover 
the pot close and cook half an hour. Ten minutes before the 
half hour is up add salt in the proportion of a teaspoonful to 
every four potatoes. After they have boiled half an hour 
pour off the water and set them on the back part of the stove. 
If you keep the metal cover on the pot, slip it a little to one 
side to allow the steam to escape and save the potatoes from 
becoming soggy. A cloth spread over the pot while the 
potatoes are steaming is better than the metal cover. Serve 
in a hot dish. 

CREAMED POTATOES 

Follow the directions given above to the instant of setting 
the pot on the back of the stove. Instead, after pouring off 
the water, add enough sweet cream to half bury the potatoes 
and set over the fire till the cream is brought to boil. Then 
take from the fire, let stand on the back of the stove for five 
minutes so that the potatoes will melt into, or absorb, the 
cream, and serve in a hot vegetable dish. Sprigs of green 
parsley may be laid on the potatoes, or they may be dusted 
with black pepper. 

FRIED POTATOES 

Slice across and not too thin cold boiled potatoes. Spread 
out, and salt and pepper them. Put in a frying-pan with hot 
lard enough to heat and brown them. Cover, because they 
brown better when covered. Set over a moderately hot fire. 
Turn the potatoes every now and then, or rather, stir them 
over with a large broad-bladed knife. Brown slowly, care- 
fully, and a light brown. When done, put them in some place 
for a short time for the grease to dry off. Serve hot. 

Raw potatoes are cooked in the same way, but are cut 
differently. Cut them lengthwise in thin pieces. Before fry- 
ing, soak them in cold water half an hour. 

Cold sweet potatoes are very nice fried in this same way, 



POTATOES AND SWEET POTATOES 167 

but they require more grease and do not dry off as much. 
Serve very hot. 

MASHED POTATOES 

Peel and boil the potatoes tender, tip off the water in 
which they were cooked and have them dry in the pot or sauce- 
pan. Sprinkle salt to taste and mash them thoroughly with 
a masher. Drop in a lump of butter to your taste and add 
cream of fresh milk, never water, for a softener and binder. 
Then beat mashed potatoes, milk, and butter together vigor- 
ously till they are white and foamy. Put in a hot vegetable 
dish and do not mash the potatoes down with a knife, but 
sprinkle with pepper, drop a small lump of butter in the middle 
and serve hot and at once. 

'MASHED POTATO WITH CHEESE RELISH 

After you have boiled and mashed the potatoes you wish to 
use, soften them with a plentiful supply of milk so that addi- 
tional cooking will not harden, and smooth them lightly in a 
baking dish. Through the centre of the potatoes make a 
deep, broad X. Glaze the potato with the white of an egg 
and set in the oven. Stir four tablespoons of cheese grated or 
cut in small bits into a saucepan holding four tablespoons of 
hot butter. Mix well, and pour slowly upon the yolks of two 
eggs which you have already well beaten. Season with salt 
and pepper, and pour the mixture in the broad X of the 
mashed potato. Let it run thoroughly through the channels 
so that taking a spoonful of the potatoes you will get some of 
the cheese sauce. After pouring in the sauce, spread bread- 
crumbs over, brown for a moment in the oven, and serve hot. 

MASHED POTATO WITH ONION AND BACON 

Cut bacon into thin slices, not much thicker than a knife 
blade. Cut the slices across, in small pieces. Slice one 
medium-sized onion very thin. Cut this in small pieces, like 
the bacon. Have a frying-pan with a trifle of hot lard to fry 



168 



THE HOME COOK BOOK 



the onion and bacon a nice brown. Fry the fat of the bacon 
all out, so that the meat will be crisp. Have ready a hot vege- 
table dish of mashed potato. Smooth it over the top. Shape 
it higher in the centre. With a spoon press down a place in the 
middle. Pour into it the bacon, onion, and fat. A spoon is 
used to serve this dish. The mixture will penetrate it and 
give a savory flavor to the mashed potato. 

MASHED POTATO AND TURNIP WITH SAUSAGE 

Peel and cut in small pieces enough potatoes to fill a quart 
measure and enough turnips to fill a pint measure. Cook the 
turnips longer than the potatoes, for they are a tougher vege- 
table. After they have become a little tender, add the potatoes 




Quart and Pint Measures 

and boil till done. Drain off the water, salt, add a tablespoon 
of butter, mash, and beat till soft and white, and serve hot 
with fried pork sausages as a meat. 

PUFFED POTATOES 
Boil and mash through a sieve six large mealy potatoes. 
Add one tablespoon of butter, one teaspoon of salt, one small 
white onion minced fine, one teaspoon of minced parsley, and 
one teacup of sweet cream or milk. Stir briskly, adding two 
raw eggs separately. Roll a tablespoon of this in flour and 
fry in a deep pan of boiling lard to make the puffs. Do not 
put in too many puffs at a time or they will stick together. 
The puffs must float in the lard and brown eve«fly. When 
crisp, remove to a dish and dust with a little fine salt. 



POTATOES AND SWEET POTATOES 169 

RIBBONS OF POTATOES 

Peel the skin from the potatoes, and then peel round and 
round, making a thin spiral ribbon of the potato. Let the 
ribbons lie in cold water an hour, drain, put in a frying basket 
and plunge into hot fat. Drain the fat from the ribbons by 
laying them a minute on blotting paper, sprinkle with salt 
and serve hot. 

SCALLOPED POTATOES 

Slice raw potatoes in thin slices. Lay them in cold water 
for one hour. Put them in a pudding dish in layers, season- 
ing each layer highly with salt, pepper, and lumps of butter. 
Fill the dish in this way, and cover with cold milk. Set in a 
hot oven. Put a pan of warm water in the upper oven above it. 
Cook until the potatoes are very tender. Give them time to 
cool a little before putting on the table. Use plenty of butter 
for this dish to make it successful. 

STEWED POTATOES 

Chop fine, potatoes that have been cooked the day before. 
Put them into a saucepan. Pour over enough milk to alniost 
cover, salt to make a good flavor, and add a large piece of 
butter (probably an iron spoonful), according to the quantity 
you may have. Set the saucepan into another containing 
water, being careful to have but little water. Boil hard one 
hour until creamy. Stir occasionally. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

Choose rather large sized potatoes and all about of the 
same size. Wash clean and bake till mealy in a moderate 
oven. Split each potato in two, scoop out the inside and with 
it mix salt, butter, milk, and a little pepper — all to your taste. 
Stir in the beaten white of an egg to each three potatoes, tuck 
back the seasoned potato in the skins, press the halves of the 
skins clo'se together, and brown in the oven. Serve the pota-

tion, Plate XVIII. ] 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES 

A SOUTHERN DISH 

Cut cold baked sweet potatoes into slices and put into 
an earthen dish ; add sugar and butter to each layer and bake 
until slightly browned. 

BOILED OR STEAMED SWEET POTATOES 

Boil or steam like white potatoes and without breaking the 
skin. If boiled, pour off the water as soon as done, cover 
the pot with a cloth and let it stand on the back part of the 
range a few minutes before serving. 

BROILED SWEET POTATOES 

Steam, pare, and cut in slices three-eighths of an inch 
thick; lay the slices in a double-broiler; salt, cover with 
melted butter, and broil over a slow fire. Serve in folded 
napkins. 

BROWNED SWEET POTATOES 

Cut cold, boiled, or steamed sweet potatoes into slices one- 
fourth of an inch thick; add butter, sugar, pepper, and salt, 
and put into a hot oven to brown. 

SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES 

Take two cups of mashed, boiled, steamed, or baked 
sweet potatoes ; add the beaten yolks of two eggs and season 
to taste ; stir over the fire until the mass parts from the sides 
of the pan. When cold form into small croquettes, roll in 
egg and breadcrumbs, and fry in hot lard to an amber color. 
Serve on napkins. The croquette mixture may be made into 
balls inclosing minced meat. When used in this way serve 
with sauce. 



POTATOES AND SWEET POTATOES 171 

FRIED SWEET POTATOES 

Cut in slices lengthwise and fry in deep grease, same as 
white potatoes. 

SWEET POTATO GLAC^ 

Boil and cut in halves medium-sized sweet potatoes, lay 
evenly in braizing pan, baste with syrup and butter warmed 
together, sprinkle lightly with brown sugar, put in hot oven 
till brown, and serve in the syrup. 

MASHED SWEET POTATOES 

Boil six large potatoes until tender. Peel and mash. Add 
salt, butter and cream to make palatable. Heap into a dish. 
Score the top and brush with beaten egg-yolk to which have 
been added one teaspoon of sherry wine and one tablespoon 
of sugar. [See illustration, Plate XVHL] 

SWEET POTATO PIE 

Boil in skins ; when tender remove skins, mash and beat 
until light; to each pint add a pint of milk and four eggs. 
Season and bake as pumpkin pie. 

SWEET POTATO PONE 

A SOUTHERN DISH 

Boil and mash through a sieve six medium-sized yam pota- 
toes. Add one teacup of cream and one tablespoon of butter. 
Beat in the yolks of two eggs. Add the beaten whites, a tea- 
spoon of sugar, and grate in quarter of a nutmeg. Bake in a 
moderate oven for fifteen minutes. 

SWEET POTATO PUREE 

Mash boiled, steamed, or baked sweet potatoes, season, and 
add enough hot milk to moisten; serve like mashed white 
potato; or put in pudding dish, dress the top with egg, and 
brown in the oven. Serve with sauce. 



172 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SCALLOPED SWEET POTATOES 

Peel the potatoes, put them into boiling water and let them 
boil fifteen or twenty minutes. Take from the water, slice 
to get round slices, and thickly cover the bottom of a baking 
dish with the circles. Upon this layer of sweet potatoes drop 
small pieces of butter and sprinkle sugar and a dash of 
cinnamon or nutmeg. Then put in another layer of the 
potatoes, then butter, sugar and spice till the dish is full, 
having the butter and sugar on top. Before setting in the 
oven pour in half a cup of boiling water. Bake till the po- 
tatoes are soft and tender. 

STUFFED SWEET POTATOES 

Bake ; then cut ofif one end and scoop out the inside ; season 
with butter, pepper and salt ; beat until light ; replace in the 
skin ; close with the piece cut ofif , and put into the oven to 
heat through. Serve in napkins. Suitable for luncheon.

BAKED NAVY BEANS 

ASH thoroughly. Put in a crock to soak overnight. 
Three pints of beans will make two average-sized bak- 
ing dishes of baked beans. In the morning put the beans in a 
granite soup kettle. Pour over them the water in which they 
have been soaked and add warm water enough to come a little 
more than two inches above the beans. After they have 
cooked an hour add three-quarters of a pound of fat salt pork. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste and one tablespoon of 
white sugar. Boil slowly and steadily five hours. After they 
begin to thicken, set the pot on an asbestos plate to prevent 
burning. Stir occasionally, and taste as to seasoning of salt 
and pepper. If the beans are needed for an evening meal, after 
they have boiled the given time, set them where they will keep 
hot without cooking any more. One hour before they are 
needed turn them into a colander. Drain ofif the liquor, of 
which there will be very little, as the beans will be soft. Put 
them in the pudding dish to within one inch or less from the 
top. Pour over a little of the liquid. Score the pork three or 
four times and put it in the middle of the beans. Set in the 
upper oven of the stove and brown lightly, and serve. 

The next day make into cakes the same as potato cakes. 
Dip your hands in cold water and mold the beans into shape. 
Put them in a frying-pan with just enough lard to brown. 
Cover while browning. They should be slightly crisp. In 
browning potato cakes or beans, or anything of that sort, never 
turn them until they are thoroughly brown, or they will lose

their shape and not be satisfactory. In cooking this quantity 
of beans you will probably have a dish ready for the next day. 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS 

Soak overnight one quart of small white beans. Next 
morning cover with water and let come to boil, but do not 
boil. Set back and simmer a few minutes and pour off the 
water. Have a bean pot ready; put in the beans; stir in salt 
to taste, and two tablespoons of molasses ; place in the centre 




A Boston Bean Pot 

a piece of scored, fat salt pork weighing three-quarters of a 
pound ; add enough water to rise to the top of the beans ; 
cover tight and bake all day, with an even, slow heat. 

BAKED BEANS WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Proceed as in the foregoing directions until you put the 
beans in the pot. At that point, instead of adding the water, 
add a quart of stewed and strained tomafoes, seasoned with 
a teaspoon of salt and a heaping tablespoon of sugar. Pour 
this over the beans and pork ; open here and there with a fork 
for the tomato sauce to run down and season the beans; cover 
the pot tight and bake slowly all day. 

FRESH LIMA OR BUTTER BEANS 

Put the beans in cold water for half an hour. Pour off 
the cold water. Put them in a saucepan and cover with hot 
water. After a few minutes' boiling, season with salt and 
pepper. Salt the beans carefully, as it is very easy to spoil 



BEANS, PEAS, AND LENTILS 175 

them. They will require a little more pepper than other vege- 
tables. When nearly done, and when but little water is left 
on them, add a large tablespoon of butter, and finish cooking. 
Do not have too much liquor over them when served. If you 
find you have too much water when they are finished, pour 
them into a colander and drain. Put them back in the sauce- 
pan and add whatever liquor you need. In this way you will 
not waste butter. 

DRIED LIMA BEANS 

Wash the beans in three cold waters. Put them into a 
crock, cover with cold water, and soak overnight. Next day 
cover with warm water. When they have boiled five minutes, 
pour off the water, and add fresh warm water. Do this twice 
more. Let the last water you cover them with be hot. Season 
carefully with salt and pepper. Allow two hours for the cook- 
ing. When nearly done add one large tablespoon of butter. 
If you are not ready to use them set them aside, and heat 
when needed by setting them in a saucepan of hot water. In 
cooking beans, or any vegetable likely to stick, set an asbestos 
plate underneath and it will need no watching. Almost any 
vegetable for evening use can be cooked in the morning and 
heated in this way. Some dishes are even better by standing. 

LIMA BEAN CROQUETTES 

Put left-over Lima beans through a colander, and to every 
cup of the bean pulp stir in an egg, a tablespoon of onion-juice, 
and, if you have it, a tablespoon of tomato sauce. Make little 
round croquettes, or flat cakes if you prefer. Dip each cake in 
a raw egg on a plate and then into rolled cracker-crumbs and 
fry an even brown in hot fat. Serve hot. 

STEWED STRING BEANS 

Be sure the beans are young, crisp, and tender. Break 
the stem end and pull it back, thus removing the string. Cut 
the bean pods into three pieces with a knife. As you cut, 



176 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

throw them into a pan of cold water. When they are ready, 
throw them into boiUng water slightly salted, and cook gently 
about forty-five minutes. Tip them in a colander to drain. 
Put back in the saucepan and mix in butter ; salt and pepper to 
taste. Let them stand in a gentle, even heat for a few minutes 
to gain taste from the seasoning. 

CREAMED STRING BEANS 

From two quarts of beans, take off the strings and cut the 
pods, as directed in the foregoing receipt. Throw into a pan 
of cold water as you cut them. Have enough boiling water 
slightly salted to cover and boil gently till tender, which will 
be in about forty-five minutes. Pour the beans in a colander. 
In the saucepan pour a cup of fresh milk and w^hen it boils stir 
in a tablespoon of flour mixed with a tablespoon of butter. As 
this thickens to a cream stir in the drained beans. Stir the 
beans about in their cream and let them stand in a gentle, 
even heat a few minutes before serving. A dash of cayenne 
may be added if agreeable to the taste. 

CREAMED PEAS 

This is a delicate way of serving canned peas ; but fresh 
peas are served in the same way, and they very often were by 
our grandmothers before canned peas were known. In using 
fresh peas boil the peas till done. In using canned peas take 
a can of peas, pour off their liquid and pour over cold water 
to rinse them. Now in a saucepan cook a tablespoon of 
flour in two tablespoons of butter, add the drained peas, 
and then two-thirds of a cup of milk. Heat and stir 
and add also a tablespoon of sugar, and salt and pepper to 
taste. 

Instead of butter and milk, pure rich cream may be used. 
This was formerly the country fashion. The cream was 
slightly thickened by stirring in a tablespoon of flour as it 
boiled. 



BEANS, PEAS, AND LENTILS 177 

CANNED PEAS 

It is unsafe to leave anything in the way of canned goods 
in the can after it is opened. The contents should be poured 
out at once. Select the finest brand of peas, open a quart 
can and pour the peas into a colander. Drain of? the liquor 
and throw it away. Pour cold water over the peas until they 
are well rinsed. It is easiest to put them under running water 
if that water is pure. Next put them in a saucepan. Add 
three iron spoons of cold water, one even teaspoon of sugar, 
and one teaspoon of salt. Taste as to seasoning and make as 
near as possible that of a sweet pea. Add one full table- 
spoon of butter. Set this saucepan in another pan contain- 
ing hot water. Do not cover the peas as the added steam 
will make too much liquid. Stir every now and then, or the 
peas will turn black. Cook half an hour, and no more, and 
be particular there is always water in the under saucepan. If 
you are not ready to serve at once set where the peas will 
keep hot. 

STEWED LENTILS 

Wash a pint of lentils, cover with fresh water and soak 
all night. In the morning pour ofif the water; have enough 
water boiling in the pot to cover the lentils. Drop them in 
and slowly boil an hour and a quarter. Tip them from the pot 
in a colander and drain. Put back in the pot; heat slowly, 
adding a heaping tablespoon of butter, a teaspoon of salt, and 
a tablespoon of onion- juice, and serve. 

LENTIL CAKES 

Press through a colander cold, left-over lentils, stewed 
according to the preceding receipt. Season to your taste with 
salt and pepper and then add to help hold the cup of pulp to- 
gether an egg or a little thick cream. Make into cakes with 
the hand ; dip in a raw egg broken on a plate, then into rolled 
cracker-crumbs and fry till brown in hot fat. Serve hot.

BOILED ARTICHOKES 

RIM the artichokes neatly and cut away the stems and 
outer leaves, which are tough. Soak half an hour to free 
from any insect which may have crept in the leaves. Have 
boiling enough salted water to cover the artichokes. Add a 
few drops of vinegar to the water and lay in the vegetables. 
Boil nearly or quite two hours. When thoroughly done drain 
and serve with drawn butter. 

BOILED ASPARAGUS 

Wash the asparagus in cold water and cut off the tough 
ends. Scrape the white part which remains and throw into 
cold water for thirty minutes. Tie in small bundles and put 
into a kettle of boiling water. A tin kettle is the best, for 
the reason that thicker vessels do not boil fast enough. Tin 
asparagus boilers come for this purpose. Boil until tender, 
adding a little salt to the water. Now have ready slices of 
toast, which should be cold. If the loaf of bread is small, 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 179 

use the whole slice ; if large, half a slice. Heat as many plates 
as you have tied bunches, and melt butter enough for all. 
Dip the toast quickly into the hot asparagus water, lay a piece 
on a plate, sprinkle a very little salt on this, and pour over 
it a small quantity of the melted butter. Lift a bunch of the 
asparagus from the water with a fork, cut the string with 
scissors and draw it away. Sprinkle more salt on the asparagus 
and pour over it melted butter. Serve hot, a bunch and a 
piece of toast to a plate. 

SCALLOPED ASPARAGUS 

Wash a large bunch of asparagus, cut in inch lengths, 
drop in boiling water and boil ten minutes. Have five eggs 
boiled hard and chopped fine. In a baking dish put a layer of 
the asparagus, over this sprinkle the chopped egg and add 
salt, pepper, and small bits of butter. Again put on a layer 
of asparagus, and again the chopped egg and seasoning. 
Have the top layer of the vegetable. Into a cup and a half of 
hot milk stir two tablespoons of flour which has been wet 
with a little of the milk. When the milk thickens pour it 
over the vegetable in the pudding dish, add a topping ofif of 
breadcrumbs, and bake in a hot oven from ten to twenty 
minutes. 

BAKED BANANAS 

A CUBAN DISH 

Remove one section of peel from each banana, and lay 
the bananas lengthwise in an earthen baking dish with this ex- 
posed side up. Stick the fruit with a fork. Squeeze over each 
banana the juice of quarter of a lemon, and on each banana 
lay one teaspoon of sugar and a lump of butter the size of 
a pea. Grate a little nutmeg over each banana. Add some 
water in the bottom of the pan to keep from burning, and 
bake half an hour in a moderate oven. For special occasions 
it is recommended to add one teaspoon of sherry or marsala 
to each banana. 



180 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

FRIED PLANTAIN OR BANANA 

A LOUISIANA RECEIPT 

If plantain is not available, use the large bananas that have 
green ends. Slice the fruit lengthwise, dip the slices in v^^hite 
of egg, dust them with flour, and fry in a deep pan of boiling 
lard. When brown, remove to a flat dish, and sprinkle with 
powdered sugar. Serve with the roast. 

TO BOIL BEETS 

Wash the beets and cook till soft. The time for cooking 
is difficult to say. Sometimes when young and tender the 
beets will cook soft in an hour. Again they need four hours. 
And not cooked soft they are tasteless and indigestible, and 
should be tabooed. When cooked slip off the skin, slice and 
serve hot with butter spread upon them. 

TO COOK BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Let the sprouts lie for half an hour in cold water strongly 
salted, so that any insects which have burrowed in them will 
come to the surface. Then drop them in boiling water, allow- 
ing a quart of water to a pint of sprouts. After they have 
boiled fifteen minutes add a small tablespoon of salt for the 
quantity named above, and boil till tender. The time will be 
twenty minutes or half an hour. Do not cook them till they 
mush. 

After they have boiled the sprouts may be served in three 
forms. First, they may be served plain-boiled, as directed 
above. A second way is to drain off the water in which they 
were boiled, and to add a dash of pepper, a cup of cream in 
which a teaspoon of flour has been stirred, and to simmer ten 
minutes, and serve. A third way is to drain off the water in 
which the sprouts are boiled, to place them in a saucepan with 
a tablespoon of butter, a dash of celery salt, and a minced red 
pepper, to brown a little, and serve.

BOILED CABBAGE 

Select a firm head of cabbage. Cut in large pieces. Cut 
out the core and lay the cabbage in cold water for half an hour. 
At the end of that time put into a granite kettle with enough 
boiling water to cover, and cook until very tender. Drain well 
before serving. 

Another nice way to prepare cabbage after boiling is to 
put it in a saucepan, chop it with a strong knife, rather 
coarse, season it with salt and a little red pepper to taste, half 
a cup of vinegar and two tablespoons of melted butter. 
Mix this together and cook five minutes and serve, very hot. 

TO MAKE SAUERKRAUT 

Choose large cabbages with white heads, take ofif the outer 
leaves and shred the cabbages very fine. Lay the outer leaves 
round the sides and bottom of a cask or tub. Then put in the 
shredded cabbage in layers about three inches deep, sprinkling 
each layer with a handful of salt. Press down the layers and 
repeat the cabbage and salt till you have used your material. 
Then put on a layer of outer leaves, spread a cloth over the 
top and also a cover smaller than the top of the cask. Put a 
heavy weight on the cover — for instance, a perfectly clean 
stone. .Set the cask in a warm place till the cabbage begins 
to ferment, then set it in a cool place. In making the change 
skim off the scum, wash the cloth, and wash or replace the 
outer leaves. Let the fermentation go on between two and 
three weeks. The sauerkraut is then ready for use. 

TO COOK SAUERKRAUT 

Wash the sauerkraut well in water, drain and put in a pot 
holding boiling water. Cook till the sauerkraut is tender, which 
will be in from two to three hours. If the water boils out 
add boiling water. Sauerkraut is eaten with fresh and salt 
pork, with corned beef, with smoked sausage, and with similar 
hearty dishes. 



182 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

STEWED CARROTS 

Have your carrots tender and young, not hard and pithy, 
as they grow with age. Wash, scrape, and cut them in small 
dice, or cut in slices and the slices again in halves and quar- 
ters. So prepare a quart. Cover with boiling water and boil 
for nearly or quite an hour. Carrots are not apt to be tender 
with less cooking. Test to see, and boil longer if necessary. 
When tender, pour off the water, add a small pint of milk, a 
small teaspoon of salt, and stir in a heaping tablespoon of 
flour mixed with a heaping tablespoon of butter. Cook up and 
stir till the flour thickens the milk. Then serve. 



CARROTS WITH ONION 

Wash and scrape young carrots and cut them in slices and 
the slices again in halves and quarters. Cover with boiling 
water and boil an hour or until tender. Then pour off the 
water, put the carrots in a saucepan and to every pint of car- 
rots stir in a tablespoon of butter blended with a tablespoon 
of flour and a pinch of salt. Let the carrots cook gently with 
this mixture, add a tablespoon of onion-juice or of minced 
onion and a dash of cayenne, allowing this quantity to a pint, 
and then serve hot. 

CAULIFLOWER 

Pick off all the outer leaves. Cut off some of the stalks, 
leaving enough to hold the cauliflower together while boiling. 
Wash it thoroughly in cold water. Put in a granite pot and 
cover with boiling water. Salt to taste, which will be near 
a tablespoon. Boil it steadily. It takes about fifteen minutes' 
steady boiling for a good-sized head of cauliflower, and ten 
minutes' for a small one. When done, take from the pot and 
carefully cut it apart. Lay it on a napkin in a hot vegetable 
dish. Turn the corners of the napkin over it. Serve with 
drawn butter. 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 183 

STEWED CELERY 

Scrape and wash the stalks of a large bunch. Cut into 
pieces one inch long. Lay in cold water fifteen minutes. Put 
in a saucepan and cover with boiling water. Add one tea- 
spoon of salt, and boil until tender. When done, put in a 
colander and drain. Save the water. Again put the celery 
in a saucepan. Nearly cover it with milk. Add three table- 
spoons of the water in which the celery boiled. Mash together 
one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of flour. As the 
milk begins to heat, stir in the mixed butter and flour. Stir 
continually until it thickens a little. Season with salt if needed 
and white pepper, and serve. 

CREAMED CELERY 

Wash the celery, cut in small pieces, and put in a saucepan 
with enough cold water to cook and steam it. Cover tight and 
boil till the celery is tender. There should be little water re- 
maining. Pour on cream in the proportion of a cup to two 
cups of the celery. Salt to taste ; boil up and thicken the cream 
by adding a tablespoon of flour to two cups of cream, dissolv- 
ing the flour in a little milk. Cook till the cream thickens, 
pepper to taste, and serve hot. 

CORN BAKED IN THE HUSK 

Lay ears of green corn in their husks in a hot oven and 
bake twenty to twenty-five minutes. Take off the husks and 
silk, with a sharp knife run down every row of kernels, so 
that the inside will come out when pressed by the teeth and 
the hard hull stay on the corn. Serve hot and eat with salt 
and butter. 

BAKED GREEN CORN 

A MISSISSIPPI DISH 

S:core eight ears of corn and scrape into a baking-pan. 
Add one cup of sweet cream, one tablespoon of butter, half 
a teaspoon of salt, and a dash of red pepper. Beat in the 



184 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

yolks of two eggs. Add the beaten whites of the eggs, and 
bake in a moderate oven one hour. Be careful to score and 
scrape the corn from the cob ; do not cut it off. 

BAKED CORN 

Chop fine two cups of canned corn. Beat an egg and 
stir it in, add a tablespoon of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 
and half a cup of milk. Beat all together, pour in a buttered 
pudding dish and bake till the whole is firm. 

TO COOK CANNED CORN 

Select the best canned corn. Turn it out the moment 
the can is opened, and put the corn in a saucepan. For a 
one-pound can of corn, add about one even teaspoon of salt 
and one even teaspoon of sugar. Mix this through the corn, 
and taste for seasoning. It should be salted to slightly taste 
of the salt, and just enough sugar to give a sweet corn flavor. 
Add three iron spoons of cold water. If, after cooking for 
a short time, a little more water is needed, add it. Put into 
the corn a large tablespoon of butter, and no pepper. Set the 
saucepan in another, with water underneath, not having too 
much water in the under saucepan. Set on the stove, without 
covering, and boil half an hour. If you cover, the steam from 
the cover will make the corn watery. 

SUCCOTASH 

Succotash is generally better made from the best canned 
corn. Cook the corn as described under "Canned Corn" above. 
Also cook the beans as directed under "Dried Lima Beans." 
When the beans have been cooked tender, pour them into a 
colander and drain off the water, and stir them into the corn. 
For a one-pound can of corn it will take about one pint of 
Lima beans. After the beans are added, it may require a 
little more water and butter to make them sufficiently juicy. 
If so, add it. Corn and beans should be cooked separately 
for succotash. Use no pepper, and no more seasoning, as 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 185 

both corn and beans are seasoned. If you wish to make 
this dish of canned Lima beans, add them in the same manner 
and the same quantity after you have drained off the Hquid 
in which they are canned, and rinsed and seasoned them. 

CORN OYSTERS 

Take fresh, sweet corn and with a sharp knife cut down 
the centre of each row of kernels. Scrape out the pulp, 
leaving the kernels on the cob. Hold your cobs over a bowl 
as you scrape out the pulp. Allow the yolk of an egg to one 
cut of pulp. Season to taste with butter, salt and pepper, 
and just before you begin to fry add the white of the egg 
beaten to a stiff froth. Have ready a griddle or frying-pan 
heated hot and covered with melted butter. Drop the corn 
batter from a spoon and it will form in the shape and size 
of oysters. Fry a light brown and serve hot on a hot plate. 

BOILED EGGPLANT 

Cut the eggplant in two and boil till soft. Take the pulp 
out of the shells. Have ready two or three slices of bacon and 
an onion or two minced together. Mix with the pulp, add a 
few grated breadcrumbs, pack back in the shells, sprinkle 
with breadcrumbs, put on bits of butter or a few drops of olive 
oil and set in the oven to brown. 

EGGPLANT IN CREOLE FASHION . 

Put a large fresh eggplant in boiling water, cook five 
minutes, remove and drain. When cold, cut off the top and 
scoop out the inside. Cook one tablespoon of fine chopped white 
onion in one tablespoon of butter. Add two tablespoons of 
chopped mushrooms and two tablespoons of chopped green 
peppers. Cook a few minutes without browning; then add 
three slices of stale bread that have been soaked in water, stir 
and cook five minutes. Remove from fire, season with half a 
teaspoon of salt, one-quarter of a teaspoon of pepper, and add 
two whole eggs. Mix this filling into the eggplant and re- 



186 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

place the top as a cover. Lay a square piece of cheesecloth on 
the table, and place a few thin slices of larding pork on the 
cloth. Put the eggplant on top and roll it in the cloth. Tie 
the cloth on both ends and put it in a deep round pan. Add 
half a can of tomatoes, one ounce of butter, half a teaspoon of 
salt, one teaspoon of sugar, a little pepper, half a tablespoon 
of fine-chopped onions and green peppers, and half a cup of 
stock or sour cream. Cover the pan tightly, place it in a 
medium hot oven to bake one hour. Shortly before serving, 
remove the eggplant, free it from the cloth, place it on a 
warm dish and garnish with baked tomatoes and potato balls. 
Rub the tomatoes in which the eggplant was cooked through 
a sieve and serve them with the eggplant. If mushrooms are 
not to be had, they may be omitted. [See illustration, Plate 
XIX.] 

FRIED EGGPLANT 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Salt the slices of eggplant and lay them in a china dish. 
Cover with a cloth and lay a weight on the cloth to press out 
the bitter juice and make the vegetable tender. Let stand half 
an hour. Then wash off the salt and dry the slices in a fresh 
cloth. Dip them in white of egg and then in flour, and fry 
in a deep pan of boiling lard. 

STUFFED EGGPLANT 

Boil an eggplant half an hour. Then cut it in two hemi- 
spheres and scrape out the pulp. Mash with two tablespoons 
of butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Beat the seasoned pulp, 
put it back in the skins, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and brown 
in the oven a few minutes before serving. 

GREENS 

Wash young spring dandelions, or beet tops, or purslane, 
or sourdock, in several waters before putting in boiling water. 
Cook for an hour or more — that is, cook till tender. The time 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 187 

varies with the condition of the greens. Add salt half an 
hour before they are done. When done, drain, press in bowl 
or mold, and serve with some such fat meat as boiled ham and 
a dash of vinegar. Cooked dandelions may also be made into 
a salad, served with a French dressing or mayonnaise. 

KALE 

Strip ofif the leaves and wash them thoroughly. Then cook 
till tender in boiling water. Drain, season with salt, butter, 
and pepper, and serve with hard-boiled egg cut in slices and 
laid over the pressed kale. A jowl of the pig or a ham end 
is sometimes cooked with the kale for the flavor it gives the 
vegetable and for a meat to eat with it. 

TO COOK KOHLRABI 
Follow rules for cooking turnips. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS 

Be sure you have the edible mushroom, not the poisonous 
toadstool. Scrape the stem and cut oflf the earthy part. Wash 
in cold water and take the skin from the top. Put them in 
a porcelain saucepan, half cover with water and stew till 
tender, which will be in about twenty minutes or half an 
hour. Salt, thicken, allowing a tablespoon of flour stirred in 
a tablespoon of butter to a pint of the mushrooms. Pepper 
may be added if wished. 

Canned mushrooms are stewed in the same way, requiring 
less cooking. 

MUSHROOMS STUFFED WITH CHICKEN 

Procure eight or ten good-sized fresh mushrooms of an 
even size, cut off the stems, remove the gills, peel neatly, drop 
them as soon as peeled in a bowl of cold water, to which one 
gill of lemon- juice has been added. Chop the mushroom 
stems fine and place a saucepan with a small fine-chopped 



188 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

white onion and one tablespoon of butter over the fire. Cook 
two minutes. Add the chopped mushroom stems. Cook 
slowly five minutes, season with one-quarter of a teaspoon 
of salt, a little pepper, and fine chopped parsley. Remove, 
and when cold divide this mixture among the well-drained 
mushrooms. Chop fine the breast of a chicken and rub it 
through a sieve, then weigh it; there should be four ounces, 
good weight. Put the meat in a bowl, add, in small portions, 
two and a half ounces of butter, stirring continually with a 
potato masher. When this is well mixed, add slowly the 
whites of two eggs and mix well. Season with half a tea- 
spoon of salt, a little nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. Place for 
one hour on ice, then add half a pint of whipped cream. Fill 
the mushrooms with this forcemeat. Set the mushrooms in 
a buttered pan, place them in the oven with good bottom heat, 
cover the top with buttered paper (but in a way that the 
paper will not touch the forcemeat) and bake till the force- 
meat is firm to the touch. Serve with cream sauce. [See 
illustration, Plate XIX.] 

BOILED OKRA 

Wash young okra and cut the spears in slices about half an 
inch thick. Have boiling in a porcelain saucepan enough salted 
water to almost cover the okra. Drop in the slices, cover and 
boil gently till tender, which will be in from twenty-five to 
forty minutes. The water will be almost boiled away. To a 
quart of okra stir in a heaping tablespoon of butter, a table- 
spoon of vinegar, and, if you like it, a dash of catsup and 
cayenne. Serve hot. This vegetable is oftenest eaten with 
chicken. 

FRIED OKRA WITH HAM 

A LOUISIANA DISH 

In a porcelain saucepan fry half a pound of minced boiled 
ham in a tablespoon of butter and add two minced onions. 
When browned add two dozen sHced spears of okra. Stir 
constantly until the okra browns. Add one teacup of tomato^ 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 189 

juice, allow it to simmer down until all the juice is absorbed 
and the vegetables begin to brown again, when the okra will 
be done. Serve in a vegetable dish. 

BAKED ONIONS 

Peel white onions and have a Boston bean pot for their 
baking. Put a layer of onions in the pot and sprinkle in half 
a teaspoon of salt and lay in a tablespoon of butter. Add 
half a cup of boiling water. Repeat this layer with the salt 
and butter, and as many times as you wish to make the quan- 
tity of onions. Set the cover of the pot on tight and bake in 
a moderate oven four or five hours. The closed pot does not 
allow the fumes to escape and annoy people, and no one 
knows you are cooking a most wholesome vegetable. Onions 
may be cooked this way without water or butter, in their own 
juice. Do not have the oven too hot. 

BOILED ONIONS 

Peel good-sized white onions, taking off the thick outer 
skin. Lay in cold water half an hour, and then put them in 
a tin saucepan of boiling water. Boil ten minutes, then pour 
off the water and cover again with fresh boiling water. Add 
a little salt. Boil until tender enough to allow a straw to run 
through. When done, turn out carefully into a colander. 
Lift each one with a spoon and lay into a hot vegetable dish. 
Sprinkle over each a good deal of salt and pour over a small 
quantity of melted butter ; no pepper. 

CREAMED ONIONS 

Peel the onions, cover with salted boiling water and cook 
till they are quite tender all through. Onions of average size 
commonly take one hour or at times one hour and a half to 
cook through thoroughly. Pour oflf the water that remains — 
much will have boiled away — and add enough sweet cream 
to rise through the onions and half cover them. Boil up and 
taste. If they need salt, add a little. Take each onion 



190 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

separately from the saucepan and lay it in the serving dish 
in order to keep its form perfect. Pour over the hot cream 
and serve. 

SPANISH ONIONS STUFFED 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Remove the hearts from the onions. Boil the outer part 
fifteen minutes, taking care they remain firm. Fry the 
minced hearts of the onions in a tablespoon of butter. Add 
one teacup of cracker-crumbs and one teacup of sweet cream, 
a teaspoon of celery seed, a dash of cayenne pepper, and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Beat in one egg. Stuff the outer 
parts of the onions with this, lay in a baking dish, spread 
over the top any stuffing you have left, and pour around the 
onions one cup of sweet milk. Then bake slowly one-half 
hour. 

BOILED PARSNIPS 

Select medium-sized parsnips. Scrape and lay them in 
cold water for half an hour. At the end of that time, pour oflf 
the water. Put them in a saucepan. Cover with boiling water, 
slightly salted. Keep covered with water while boiling, and 
add more water when needed. Boil the parsnips very tender, 
which will take one hour or more. When done, lay in a hot 
dish. If they are large, split them lengthwise. One way 
of dressing parsnips is to sprinkle each parsnip separately 
with salt and pepper, and pour over a quantity of melted 
butter. Another is to sprinkle them with pepper, and pour 
over drawn butter, which is made as follows : One heaping 
tablespoon and a half of butter, one heaping tablespoon and 
a half of flour mashed together in a small saucepan. Pour 
over one teacup and a half of hot water and stir to dissolve. 
Salt to taste. Set this saucepan in another containing water. 
Let the mixture come to boil. Stir constantly until it thick- 
ens, keep very smooth, and have just thick enough to pour 
easily. Pour over the parsnips, and serve. . . 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 191 

FRIED PARSNIPS 

Split and scrape parsnips. Lay them in cold water for 
half an hour. Put in a saucepan of boiling water, and boil 
until tender. When done, drain. Roll- crackers very fine, and 
season with red pepper and salt. Beat one egg with one 
tablespoon of water. Dip the parsnip in the egg, and roll in 
the cracker. Fry them a light brown and serve in a hot dish. 

SCALLOPED PARSNIPS 

Wash and scrape the parsnips and cut them the long way 
in halves. Have enough boiling water to cover and boil 
gently about forty-five minutes, till tender. Drain and cut 
each half into small pieces. In a baking dish put a layer of 
the cut parsnips with a seasoning of salt and minced onion. 
Over this a thin layer of breadcrumbs, well spread with but- 
ter. Repeat the parsnips and then the breadcrumbs. Have 
the top layer of the crumbs. Pour over the dish milk cooked 
to a creamy thickness with flour. Let the milk rise almost to 
the top of the scallop, set in a moderate oven and bake twenty 
minutes to half an hour. 

STUFFED PEPPERS 

Take six or seven good-sized peppers, remove the seeds 
and inner pith, and set over the fire in boiling water for fifteen 
minutes. Pour two tablespoons of melted butter over a cup 
of fine breadcrumbs. Add an egg and half a teaspoon of 
salt, mix thoroughly, and lastly add a cup of chopped cold 
meat softened with stock or water. Mix all again, stufif the 
forcemeat into the hollow peppers, set in a pan with a little 
hot water, and bake in a moderate oven till the peppers are 
thoroughly cooked through — allowing an hour for the baking. 

SWEET PEPPERS WITH RICE 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Boil four large peppers until they are tender and can be 
easily pierced with a fork, then remove the stems and seed. 



192 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Into a deep hot saucepan put one teacup of beef dripping. 
When this is at boiling point add one large cup of minced 
small green onions. Brown thoroughly, and add one teacup 
of canned tomatoes. Cook three minutes, stirring constantly 
to keep from burning. Add a good pinch of thyme, two 
minced garlic cloves, a good pinch of red pepper, and salt 
to taste. When browned, add two teacups of cold boiled rice. 
Brown the whole, moistening with cold soup stock or any 
gravies you may have left over. Cook slowly for five minutes. 
Stuff the peppers with this rice mixture. Be careful not to 
break them. Lay them in a shallow pan and bake for ten 
minutes in a moderate heat. Serve hot. 

SALSIFY OR OYSTER-PLANT 
Scrape the roots and throw each one into cold water as 
you scrape, or it will turn black. Put into a saucepan, cover 
with boiling water and stew about three-quarters of an hour 
until tender. When done, turn off nearly all the water and 
add enough milk to cover. Thicken with one tablespoon of 
butter and one tablespoon of flour stirred together, and put 
in the milk after it has boiled ten minutes. Boil gently until 
the milk thickens. 

MOCK OYSTERS 
Scrape salsify roots and throw each one as you scrape it 
into cold water. Cover with boiling water and boil gently 
three-quarters of an hour. They will then be tender. Mash 
the roots and put through a colander. Then season with 
salt and pepper to taste and stir in beaten eggs, allowing one 
egg to two heaping tablespoons of the salsify pulp. Have on 
a griddle or in a saucepan hot fat. Drop the mixture from 
a spoon and fry. When one side is brown turn the salisfy 
icake and brown on the other side. Serve hot. 

TO BOIL SPINACH 
Spinach is a most wholesome vegetable, carrying of all 
vegetables the greatest amount of iron, and it is a pity it is not 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 193 

more commonly eaten by Americans. It gains in taste by a 
little added care. 

Wash the spinach thoroughly and put it in a pot of boiling 
salted water. A pinch of soda is sometimes added to keep 
the spinach green. Let it boil from twenty to thirty minutes. 
When tender pour in a colander or sieve and drain. After 
the water is out, serve ; or see next receipt. 

FRENCHED SPINACH 

Proceed exactly as the foregoing receipt directs. After 
your spinach has drained, put it in a bowl and chop it fine. 
Next put in a saucepan, add butter and a dash of pepper, 
and serve smoking hot as a vegetable. 

SPINACH WITH EGGS ON TOAST 

Proceed exactly as in the two foregoing receipts, except 
the serving. Have ready thin slices of buttered toast and 
lay a spoonful of spinach on each slice. Upon each spoonful 
of spinach slip an egg which has been poached. Or if hard- 
boiled eggs are preferred, halve the eggs and push the halves 
in the spinach, leaving the gold and white side uppermost, 
and dusting the whole with pepper. 

SPINACH MOUSSE 

Put half a peck of well-washed spinach in a saucepan of 
boiling water. Add half a tablespoon of salt, and cook three 
minutes from the time it begins to boil. Remove, drain, and 
chop the spinach fine, then weigh it. There should be two 
pounds. Melt two tablespoons of butter, add one heaping 
tablespoon of flour, stir and cook two minutes. Add one cup 
of milk, and cook to a thick, smooth sauce. Remove from 
the fire, pour the sauce into the spinach and add four well- 
beaten eggs. Season with salt and pepper, mix all well to- 
gether, pack the spinach in a well-buttered melon mold ; place 
this in a steamer and cook for one hour. Shortly before 

serving, turn the mousse on to a warm dish. Rub the yolks

194 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

of two hard-boiled eggs through a sieve and decorate the top 
of the spinach with it. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs cut in 
half. [See illustration, Plate XX.] 

TO COOK SQUASH 

The small crookneck summer squash is the best. All 
kinds are cooked the same way. Cut the squash apart and 
take out the seeds. The crookneck does not require peeling. 
Lay the pieces in cold water. Squash is best steamed. Set 
the steamer over a kettle of boiling water. Cook until tender, 
which will be from one-half to three-quarters of an hour for 
the softer squashes. When done, put in a saucepan, mash 
fine and smooth, add butter, salt and pepper to taste, and 
serve very hot. 

BAKED SQUASH 

Cut a winter squash in two down its length. Take out 
the seeds and filaments and set the halves in a dripping-pan. 
Put water in the pan and cover the squash, and in a moderate 
oven bake from an hour and a half to two hours. A quarter of 
an hour before the squash is done take from the oven, empty 
the water from the pan, and sprinkle salt and spread butter 
round the upper or pulp portion of the two halves. Set back 
in the oven to brown, and serve, setting the halves on a platter 
and dipping the squash from its own shell. 

SQUASH IN THE SHELL 

Select a well-shaped cymling, cut a thick slice from the 
stem end and scoop out seeds and fibre. Fill up with force- 
meat and breadcrumbs highly seasoned. Stand in a shallow 
baking-pan in a larger pan of boiling water. Bake four or 
five hours. Garnish with fried sausages. [See illustration, 
Plate XX.] 

SQUASH CAKES 

This is an excellent way to utilize squash left from a meal. 
Put it through a colander or sieve. Mix in half as much fine 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 195 

bread rolled or crumbed as you have squash. Season to your 
taste with salt, pepper, butter and a dash of onion- juice. It 
is a good proportion to allow about a tablespoon of butter 
to two cups of the mashed squash. Mix all together and 
form into cakes or croquettes. Have upon a plate a raw egg, 
or the white of an egg whipped with a tablespoon of cold 
water. Also have rolled cracker or bread crumbs. Dip the 
squash cakes in the egg, then in the crumbs, and fry in hot 
fat until brown. 

RAW TOMATOES 

Take firm, ripe, good-sized tomatoes. Have a pan in 
which is boiling water. Put a fork into the tomato, turn it 
over and over a moment in the boiling water. With a small 
sharp knife peel off the skin. Scoop out the piece above 
the core, and cut off any rough pieces, so that the tomato 
may be smooth. Continue to peel one at a time until you 
have the number required. Lay on an earthen plate, and set on 
the ice in the morning. By evening they will be firm and 
refreshing. Serve whole, with French dressing. If you pre- 
fer them sliced, cut them half an hour before the meal, and 
cut thin strips of green pepper and lay between them. The 
flavor is very nice. 

BAKED RIPE TOMATOES 

Select good-sized, smooth tomatoes. Wash in cold water, 
and wipe dry. Cut out the core, and any rough places on top 
and lay in a pudding dish. In place of the core, put quite a 
teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of sugar, nearly a teaspoon of 
butter, and pepper to taste. A large tomato would require 
a heaping teaspoon of sugar. Fill the space between the toma- 
toes with breadcrumbs. Sprinkle over them salt and pepper. 
Set the dish in a moderately hot oven. Put a pan of water in 
the oven above it. Bake steadily one hour and a quarter. 
When done (and do not let them burn at all), set them aside 
to cool a short time before putting on the table. 



196 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BAKED RIPE TOMATOES WITH CORN 

Select smooth, fine, large tomatoes. Wash them in cold 
water, and wipe dry. Take out the cores. Sprinkle bread- 
crumbs in the bottom of a shallow pudding dish, and season 
them with pepper and salt. Put the tomatoes in the pud- 
ding dish. Have ready very fine sweet sugar corn, cut care- 
fully from the cob, and scrape the pulp ofif with the back of 
a knife. Season this corn with salt, a little red pepper, and 
sugar to taste. Stufif the cored tomatoes with the corn. Put 
a large piece of butter on top of each tomato, and over this 
some fine breadcrumbs. Season with a little salt and pepper. 
Bake in a moderately hot oven, with a pan of warm water in 
the oven above. Bake steadily one hour and a quarter. Let 
cool a short time before serving. 

BOILED TOMATOES 

Choose smooth tomatoes of nearly the same size. Drop 
into salted boiling water and boil until you can easily pierce 
them with a fork. Lift and put on hot buttered toast. Score 
the top of each, place on it a little ball of butter mixed with 
salt, a trifle of sugar and pepper if you like, and serve at once 
and hot. 

FRIED TOMATOES 

Choose firm tomatoes, not too ripe. Wash in cold water 
and wipe dry. Cut in two halves. Season them separately 
and highly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle half a teaspoon of 
sugar over each piece. Have a frying-pan with some hot lard 
and butter. Lay the tomatoes in it and cook slowly until done, 
which will be nearly one hour. Take up with a cake turner, 
lay on a hot platter, pour over them melted butter, and serve. 

FRIED GREEN TOMATOES WITH HAM 

Cut green tomatoes in halves if they are small ones ; 
if large, cut in four pieces. Dredge the pieces lightly

hot platter round broiled ham or broiled bacon. Make a 
sauce or gravy by pouring off nearly all the fat of the drip- 
pings, and then pouring into the saucepan half or three-quar- 
ters of a cup of milk. Let boil up and pour over the tomatoes. 

STEWED TOMATOES 

Take fine red tomatoes all of a size and pour over them 
boiling water to loosen their skins. Slip off the skins and 
lay the tomatoes in a dish with a little butter, salt, and pepper 
sprinkled over them. Set them in the oven and cook fifteen 
minutes. Then turn the tomatoes, add a little more butter, a 
dredging of flour, a small cup of milk to seven or eight toma- 
toes, and cook slowly till the tomatoes are done. The later 
cooking may be either in the oven or on the back of the stove. 

CANNED STEWED TOMATOES 

Pour the contents of a quart can of tomatoes in a saunce- 
pan. Season with one full teaspoon of salt, one full teaspoon 
of sugar, and two dashes of pepper. Tomatoes vary as to 
acid. Taste as you season. They must not be at all sweet, 
merely a blending of all three seasonings. They require 
enough salt for a lively flavor, just enough pepper to taste 
after waiting a second, the right flavor not coming at once. 
Add one large tablespoon of butter. Set the saucepan on a 
cooler part of the stove, where in boiling the tomatoes will not 
stick to the bottom. Boil steadily, and slowly, half an hour, 
uncovered, stirring and watching carefully. At the end of 
that time put the saucepan in another with hot water in it. 
Add two slices of stale bread crust broken in coarse pieces. 
Stir in. Cover, and cook steadily again for another half hour. 
If not ready to serve, more cooking will do no harm. After 
setting them in the hot water, no more watching will be 
needed. Tomatoes require very thorough cooking to be per- 
fect. If there are any left for next day, add a little water, if 
too thick, and heat, standing in the water. They are quite as 
good as when fresh cooked.

STUFFED TOMATOES 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Select large, round, firm tomatoes. From four of these 
remove the hearts, taking care not to break the shells or skins. 
Have a tablespoon of boiling butter in a saucepan and to this 
add one minced onion and the minced hearts of the tomatoes. 
Add one teacup of minced cold meat, also one cup of cracker 
crumbs. Brown these well, seasoning with minced garlic, a 
teaspoon of minced parsley, a pinch of thyme and rosemary, 
half a teaspoon of salt and some red pepper. When browned, 
stir into it two raw eggs. Stuff the tomatoes, lay them in a 
shallow baking dish, pour round them some canned tomato- 
juice, and bake one-half hour in a moderate oven. 

DICED TURNIPS 
Cut the turnips before cooking into dice, or with a vege- 
table scoop into little balls the size of a small marble. Boil 
till tender. Serve hot in a dish after pouring over the dice 
or balls melted butter seasoned with paprika or cayenne and 
chopped parsley. 

MASHED TURNIPS 
Pare carefully from the turnips the thick, hard rind, cut 
them in halves or quarters, put in boiling water and cook 
till tender. Allow fifteen or twenty minutes longer than for 
boiling potatoes. When they are done pour off and press out 
the water, using a large plate for pressing them. Mash them 
as you mash potatoes, and to make sure they are free from 
lumps mash them in a colander or sieve, pressing them through 
with the masher. Put in a saucepan, set over the fire and 
stir constantly for some minutes, adding salt and butter. 
Serve in a vegetable dish, dust over them pepper and drop on 
pieces of butter the size of acorns. 

STEAMED TURNIPS 
Select medium-sized turnips. Slice across the turnip, in 
slices not quite three-quarters of an inch thick. Wash in 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 199 

cold water, lay in a steamer, and set over a pot of boiling 
water. Put the lid on, and set a weight or flatiron on top 
to keep it firmly covered, and keep the water boiling hard. 
Boil until the turnips are tender, which will be in about two 
hours. Have ready three tablespoons of melted butter. Take 
out half of the turnips and lay them in a vegetable dish. 
Sprinkle them with a good deal of salt and pepper, and pour 
over them half of the melted butter. Now put the remainder 
of the turnips in the dish, and proceed as before, pouring 
the other half of the butter over them. This done, take a 
silver fork and lightly turn them over, to mix the butter 
through them.

BAKED MACARONI 

BOIL quarter of a pound of macaroni until tender. When 
done, put it in a colander and drain. Have ready a shallow 
pudding dish buttered. Put a layer of macaroni in the bottom 
of the dish. Sprinkle over it salt, a little red pepper carefully, 
one tablespoon of melted butter, one iron spoon of tomatoes 
stewed and seasoned, one iron spoon of cream, and one table- 
spoon of grated cheese. Prepare the second layer in the same 
way. When done, turn this over lightly with a fork to mix 
well. In a separate dish season some of the boiled macaroni 
with salt, white pepper, one teaspoon of melted butter, and 
one teaspoon of grated cheese. 'Mix. Spread this over the 
top of the first dish of macaroni. Brown lightly in an upper 
oven. 

BOILED MACARONI 

Select the best macaroni, in which there is great choice, 
some being very tough. Have ready a large tin saucepan, as 
it requires a great deal of water and a very hard boiling, which 
granite will not give. Fill the pot three-quarters full of water. 
Break the macaroni into pieces two inches long. It will re- 
quire twenty-two sticks of the macaroni for a large vegetable 
dish. Have the water boiling hard, and drop it in, a Uttle at 
a time, and add a teaspoon of salt. With a large meat fork, 
move it now and then so it will not stick to the bottom. Add 
hot water as the water boils away, and keep plenty over the 
macaroni until done. It is not done until perfectly tender, 



MACARONI. RICE, FRITTERS 201 

which will be one hour or one hour and a quarter. When done, 
pour it into a colander and drain off the water. Have ready 
in a tin cup two or three tablespoons of melted butter. Put 
half the macaroni into a hot vegetable dish, sprinkle a good 
deal of salt, a very little red pepper, a quarter of a teaspoon 
of dry mustard, a heaping tablespoon of grated cheese, and 
part of the melted butter. Now, add the rest of the macaroni 
the same as before. Put over the seasoning, and when done 
turn it over twice with a silver fork, so that the butter is well 
through it. Serve very hot. 

MACARONI WITH HAM 

Mince fine a slice of raw ham, add a minced onion, and 
brown all together in a saucepan. Moisten the ham with 
tomato sauce, lay it over half a pound of macaroni which you 
have cooked in boiling water. Sprinkle with four or five 
teaspoons of grated cheese and serve. 

TO COOK RICE 

EAST INDIA RECEIPT 

Wash thoroughly a cup and a half of the best rice. Set 
over the fire a pot holding four quarts of cold water. Put in 
the rice and bring to boil and ke^ep boiling until you can mash 
the rice kernels between thumb* and finger. Salt five minutes 
before this point is reached. Take off the pot, throw in it a 
quart of cold water, tip the rice on a sieve or colander to drain 
thoroughly, set in the oven to dry out, and serve hot. Each 
kernel will be separate and flaky when cooked in this way. 

RICE CROQUETTES 

Wash one teacup of rice in cold water. Pour it in a double- 
boiler, and pour over it a little more than one quart of hot 
water. Add one heaping teaspoon of salt. Boil until very 
soft. When done, which will be one hour or more, take out 
the rice, put it in a pudding dish, and cover while hot to 
prevent its becoming hard on top. It is better to cook this the 



202 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

day before using it. To make the croquettes, mash the rice 
with a heavy spoon. Stir into it, and mix well, one beaten 
egg. Have a bowl of flour. Make the rice into oblong cro- 
quettes, dipping the hands into flour to shape them, and using 
the flour freely. When all are made, put them on a plate and 
set on the ice to harden. Fry, in hot lard, just enough lard 
to prevent them from sticking. Turn them from side, and 
brown a nice brown. In frying, have ready melted lard to 
add if needed. When eaten, they should be split open length- 
wise, and eaten with butter. This is a very delicate and nice 
way of preparing rice. 

TO MAKE RICE CROUSTADES 

A help to use up cold meats may be found in rice crou- 
stades. To make the croustades take a cup of boiled rice, 
season it, stir into it a beaten egg, and beat with a spoon till 
all becomes a paste or pasty. Then press it into little molds — 
patty pans or hollow cup forms. Next bake in a moderate 
oven till the rice takes on a shade of brown. Into these crou- 
stades may be put creamed fish, creamed chicken, a mince of 
chicken and ham, a mince of beef and onions, and other meats, 
according to methods of cooking left-over meats which are 
given in this book. 

CURRIED RICE 

Boil rice, pour off the water, and put into a hot vegetable 
dish. Take half a cup of hot cream and mix in it a tablespoon 
of butter and one or two teaspoons of curry powder, accord- 
ing to taste. Pour over the rice enough to moisten it well 
and serve at once. 

RICE FRITTERS 

Take a cup of boiled rice, a tablespoon of butter, half a 
teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk. 
Put in a double-boiler and heat to boiling point. Stir in one 
egg and the yoke of another. Take from the fire and set to 



MACARONI, RICE, FRITTERS 208 

cool. When cold add the white of the second egg beaten to 
a froth. Mix together, drop in large spoonfuls in deep, hot 
fat ; fry to a golden brown ; drain on brown or blotting paper 
and serve at once. 

FRITTER BATTER 

Beat the yolk of an egg and add half a teaspoon of salt, 
a teaspoon of melted butter, and half a cup of milk. Have a 
cup of flour sifted and stir it in the milk and egg. Then add 
the beaten white. Always mix some time before frying, to 
allow the flour grains to swell. The batter must be very 
light. This batter may be used for clam fritters, oyster fritters, 
and pineapple and banana fritters. Many tastes prefer the 
batter unsweetened even with fruits. It may be made sweet, 
however, by adding a heaping tablespoon of sugar. Use deep 
fat and, if you have it. a frying basket, draining carefully. A 
greasy fritter is one of the most indigestible compounds known 
to the dietary. Inclose your fruit or other filling in a small 
spoonful of batter, drop into deep hot fat and fry till the fritter 
is a golden brown. 

APPLE FRITTERS 

Use one small pint of sweet milk, three eggs, one teaspoon 
of salt, and flour enough to make a pancake batter. Add one 
cup of chopped apples. Drop from a spoon into boiling lard. 
Put on a hot dish to drain a moment, and serve hot. 

FRIED APPLES 

Choose fine tart apples, wash and wipe them dry. Do not 
peel. Cut in thin circular slices. In an iron or porcelain 
saucepan have drippings or lard hot, and enough to cover the 
bottom well. Slip in the apples and fry till they are cooked 
soft. Turn them with a knife, and watch that they do not 
burn. Serve smoking hot when thoroughly done.

EGG AS A BEVERAGE 

Beat one egg very light, not separating the yolk and white. 
Add two or three tablespoons of rich milk, a little nutmeg 
if preferred, and one tablespoon of sherry wine, or whiskey, 
but preferably no flavoring at all. There is said to be as much 
nourishment in one egg taken in this way as there is in one 
pound of beef. 

EGG COCKTAIL 

Make each cocktail separately. Use a few drops of wine 
or cider vinegar, a tablespoon of lemon- juice, a pinch of horse- 
radish, and a teaspoon of tomato ketchup, mixing all together. 
Beat a perfectly fresh egg and pour it over the mixture. Two 
or three drops of Tabasco sauce may be added, but it is best 
not to drive the appetite. 

EGG CROQUETTES 

Boil four eggs till they are perfectly hard. Then rub 
through a fine sieve, add three tablespoons of cream, a dash 
of pepper, a saltspoon of salt, and stir well all together. Add 
also a teaspoon of butter. Stir thoroughly and thicken with 
pulverized cracker stiiiP enough to form into balls. Make up 
in little balls, roll each ball in cracker dust and drop into deep, 
hot fat. When the croquettes are brown, take out with a per- 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 205 

forated or wire spoon and drain. Serve with crisp, hot bacon, 
or cold with a lettuce salad. 

CURRIED EGGS 

Wet two large spoons of flour with half a cup of milk 
which you take from a scant quart. Add half a teaspoon of 
salt and mix in two teaspoons of curry powder. Put the rest 
of the scant quart of milk in a flat saucepan over a moderate 
fire. When it becomes hot stir in your flour and curry mix- 
ture and cook till the milk thickens. Carefully break half a 
dozen eggs so that neither yolk nor white is broken — to break 
them into a saucer is the surest way. Slip the broken eggs 
into the bubbling milk and let them cook till the white sets. 
It will take two and a half or three minutes. Carefully remove 
the eggs with a large spoon or ladle, lay each egg on a piece 
of golden brown toast, just toasted, pour over the toast enough 
of the curried milk to soften the toast, and serve at once. 

FRIED EGGS 

Eggs fried in lard are more delicate than those fried in 
bacon fat. Put just enough lard in a granite frying-pan to 
keep the eggs from sticking. Break the eggs in a saucer, 
sprinkle a little salt over each one separately, and when the 
lard is hot pour them in to cook. Cook slowly over a moderate 
fire. They should be white on the underside, and not brown, 
when done. If preferred folded, use a broad knife, and fold 
them over from both sides when half set, holding with the 
knife a second to prevent their turning back. Sprinkle no 
pepper over them. Serve on a hot platter. 

EGGS AND ONIONS 

Boil six eggs for twenty minutes, then drop in cold water. 
When cool enough to handle, peel, and slice four and the 
whites of the other two. Set to fry in a tablespoon of butter 
or drippings six white onions of average size, sliced. Let 
the onions fry slowly, keeping in their steam with a tight cover. 



206 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

When they are browned, salt, and put on a flat hot dish. Lay 
the sHced eggs over them. Mix the two hard-boiled yolks you 
reserved, mashing with three tablespoons of cream. Mix 
slowly. Boil up the cream, add a dash of cayenne, pour over 
the onions and eggs, and serve. 

EGGS AS PANCAKES 

Have the griddle used in cooking pancakes and flapjacks 
heated to a smooth, gentle heat. Rub it with a swab of suet 
fat or of salt pork, and slip from a saucer one by one the eggs 
you wish to cook. When the whites of the eggs cook to a 
golden brown underneath, turn them with a broad knife or 
pancake turner, and let the white brown on the other side. 
Sprinkle with salt and serve on a hot dish. 

Muffln rings may be oiled and set on the griddle, and the 
eggs dropped within them are kept from spreading. 

PICKLED EGGS 

First boil the eggs half an hour. Drop them in cold water 
to cool, remove the shells and put the eggs in an earthen or 
glass jar. Cover them with hot vinegar. Or if you wish to 
give them a spiced flavor pour over them vinegar in which 
peppers, allspice, cardamom seeds, and cloves have been boiled. 
But the plain pickled eggs are to most tastes the best. Let 
them stand twenty-four hours before serving. 

POACHED EGGS 

Cook in a utensil that comes for poaching eggs (which keep 
the shape better), or in a granite saucepan. Break the eggs, 
one at a time, in a small saucer, and slip them carefully into 
the poacher. Then set the poacher in a pan of salted water 
which has come to boil. Boil gently until the eggs are set, 
which will be about three minutes. 

If you poach in a saucepan, salt the water, let it boil, and 
keep it hot. Break the eggs in a saucer, and slip them care- 
fully in the water. Then set the saucepan forward, and boil 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 207 

gently until done. Take the eggs out with a perforated ladle. 
Have ready toast that has been browned, buttered, and cov- 
ered for a short time with a pan so that it will be moist. Lay 




A Perforated Ladle 

each egg on a slice of toast. Pour melted butter over the 
eggs. Serve on separate plates, or all on one dish, very hot. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

Beat six eggs very light. When beaten add about one- 
quarter of an even teaspoon of salt and one-third of a cup 
of sweet milk. Stir together. Melt butter enough in a granite 
saucepan to prevent the egg sticking. When hot pour in the 
eggs. When they are set about the edge and begin to cook, 
take an iron spoon (it requires a large spoon), slip it under 
and pile up the egg toward the middle. Never stir the eggs, 
and break them as little as possible. Cook to look soft on the 
top, and cook over a very moderate fire. When done, slip 
a cake turner under the eggs, and slide them into a hot vege- 
table dish. Serve hot and immediately, as they become heavy 
by standing. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CHEESE 

The mixture for scrambling is made by allowing to one 
egg one tablespoon of milk and one tablespoon of grated 
cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. Beat the eggs, add the 
other ingredients and scramble quickly in a hot saucepan. Do 
not cook until hard and dry, but take from the fire while still 
soft and serve in a hot dish. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS AND DRIED BEEF 
See that the beef is broken or cut in small pieces. Freshen 
it by letting it stand in boiling hot water a minute. Take 



208 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

about a quarter of a pound of the meat. Beat slightly four 
eggs, add quarter of a cup of milk and tip in the dried beef 
from which you have pressed the water. In a saucepan melt 
a couple of tablespoons of butter ; when the butter is hot put in 
the eggs and meat, stir lightly, and keep the eggs from stick- 
ing to the saucepan. Do not cook till the eggs are hard and 
dry, but take from the fire while soft and serve at once in a 
hot dish. 

STUFFED EGGS 

Boil six eggs hard. Some hours after, when cold, cut them 
neatly in half and take out the yolks. Cut a small piece from 
the bottom of the whites so they will stand. Put the yolks in 
an earthenware dish or bowl, mash and make them into a stiff 
paste, seasoning with salt, a little red pepper, a pinch of mus- 
tard, a little sugar, vinegar, cream, and olive oil, being careful 
not to add too much vinegar. No rule as to quantity can be 
given, as the size of eggs varies. The seasoning must be guided 
by the taste. Fill the whites and pile on top. These are nice 
as a relish and very good laid on two or three crisp lettuce 
leaves which have been moistened with French dressing. 

SWISS EGGS 

Rub butter over the bottom of an earthen baking dish or 
plate and lay in the dish as many thin slices of cheese as you 
use eggs, upon each slice of cheese placing an Qgg which you 
have broken as if for poaching. Sprinkle the eggs with a 
seasoning of salt and pepper ; then sprinkle with grated cheese, 
and bake till the whites are set. 

WHIRLED EGGS 

Have crisp, buttered toast, brown and hot. Have also a 
quart of salted boiling water in a deep saucepan or kettle. 
Have the water boiling hard. Stir it one way round and round 
with a large spoon till it whirls rapidly. One by one break 
eggs in a cup and drop in the centre of the whirling water. 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 209 

Keep the water whirling and the egg will roll up in a round 
ball. Take the egg from the water with a perforated spoon 
or ladle and lay on a piece of toast. Salt, pepper, and serve 
hot. 

TO MAKE OMELETS 

Use an iron, not a tin or earthen saucepan, and have it 
scoured perfectly clean and smooth. Break in a bowl four' 
eggs and beat them not more than fifteen beats, but these 
give with vigor. If you beat the eggs too much and have 
too many air cells, the air expands in the saucepan and con- 
tracts when the eggs are put on a cooler plate, and so the 
omelet is heavy. To the four eggs beaten fifteen strong 
strokes add lightly a tablespoon of hot water to each egg — 
four tablespoons of hot water. In the iron saucepan put a 
piece of butter as large as the yolk of an egg. In the four 
eggs drop a piece half as large. As soon as the butter in the 
saucepan melts and is hot pour in the eggs. Set over a hot 
fire and as the eggs stiffen slip carefully under them a thin 
pliable knife so that the liquid egg on top will run under and 
form another layer of set eggs. Sprinkle over all about half 
a teaspoon of salt and a dash of pepper, and if there is any 
more liquid egg lift again, let it run down to the hot 
saucepan and set. When the egg is set, cooked, but not hard 
and not brown, put your knife under the part of the omelet 
nearest you, and roll it over on the part furthest from you. 
Have ready a hot plate, slip the omelet on the plate and serve 
at once. Omelets should not stand, but should be eaten at 
once ; they should not be cooked till those to eat them are 
ready. 

Milk toughens omelets. Salt, except at the last, or flour 
for stiffening also toughens omelets. 

SWEET OMELETS 

Beat six eggs according to the foregoing directions "To 
Make Omelets." Have an omelet or frying pan hot, and melt 



210 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

in it a tablespoon of butter. Pour in your mixture. Do not 
stir or shake the pan till the omelet sets. To keep it from 
scorching take a long-bladed knife and slip under the omelet 
and loosen it from the pan. Allow five minutes for its 
cooking. Take it from the fire, spread over it preserved 
plums, peaches, cherries, or tart apples, or whatever fruit 
you choose, fold it over once in the form of a turnover, slip 
it on a hot platter, sift over it a little fine sugar and serve at 
once. An omelet becomes heavy if it stands. 

CORN OMELET 

A tasty omelet is made by using the two or three ears 
of green corn left from the dinner the day before. Cut the 
upper part of the kernels from the cob, set to warm, and when 
your omelet is done fold in the hot corn. In making, use 
the receipt for a plain omelet. 

JELLY OMELETS 

Omelets spread with jelly, such as crab-apple jelly, currant 
jelly, grape jelly, are all alike tasty and wholesome. 

MEAT OMELETS 

Chicken omelets are made by spreading minced chicken 
upon the lower half of the omelet before folding over. 
Tongue omelets, ham omelets, and oyster omelets are also 
prepared in the same way. 

OMELET WITH PEAS 

Beat the yolks of two eggs lightly, add two tablespoons 
of cold water, fold in the whites, beaten dry, turn into a small 
omelet pan slightly greased with olive oil, and stand over the 
fire till set. Then dry in the oven, dust with salt, fold and 
turn out on a hot platter. Garnish with a rim of stewed peas. 
Do not overcook the omelet. The centre should be soft and 
creamy. 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 211 

SPANISH OMELET 
Add a little fine-chopped onion, or onion- juice, to a plain 
omelet — allowing four or five drops of juice to an egg. 

TOMATO OMELET 

Make a plain omelet, and just before folding over spread 
hot cooked tomatoes on the lower half. Fold, pour hot 
tomatoes round the omelet and serve at once. If this dish is 
made for an invalid the tomatoes should be put through a 
colander or sieve, and freed from seeds. 

COTTAGE CREAM CHEESE 

Having first skimmed the milk, set it in its pan upon the 
back of the stove, or over a kettle of boiling water. Stir the 
milk gently while it is getting hot. When the whey is too 
hot to hold the finger in — as it heats the curd and whey 
separate — pour into a cheesecloth bag or a strainer and let it 
drip till the curd is drained. Put the curd into a bowl and 
season with salt and cream, giving one teaspoon of salt and a 
small teacup of cream to a milk pan of milk, and stirring well. 
This cream cheese is prettily served piled high in a dark blue 
or green bowl, or in glass. 

POT OR DUTCH CHEESE 

Put a panful of loppered milk on a slow fire, or over a 
kettle of hot water. Heat slowly, until the curd and whey 
separate. Stir, and do not scald or the curd will become 
tough. When the curd and whey entirely separate, pour into 
a cheesecloth bag and drain. Stir into the curd enough but- 
ter, sweet cream, and salt to make it moist. Add pepper, if 
you like, then mound on lettuce leaves, or make into tiny soft 
balls not much larger than an English walnut. 

FONDUE 

Mix together seven ounces of cheese cut fine, two ounces 
of rolled cracker or bread crumbs, and two ounces of softened 



212 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

butter. Pour over this one pint of sweet milk, which has come 
to boil, and stir. Next, add the yolks of three beaten eggs 
and a little salt. Keep warm until all is dissolved, then add 
the whites of the eggs, which have been beaten to a stiff froth. 
Stir in lightly with a silver fork. Grease a pudding dish, 
pour the mixture into this, and bake twenty minutes in an 
upper oven, as the lower one melts the cheese. Serve hot as 
soon as done. 

WELSH RAREBIT 

Into a saucepan or chafing dish put one tablespoon of 
butter, half a teaspoon of dry mustard, quarter of a teaspoon 
of cayenne, and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Melt 
and stir, and then add a small cup (one gill) of milk. When 
well blended, stir in a pound of soft American cheese which 
has been grated or cut in small dice. Let the cheese melt, 
stir all the time and blend well, and then pour over small 
pieces of golden brown toast, and serve at once. If the cheese 
should by some quality thicken too much, add a little more 
milk. Beer may be used in place of milk, but milk is here 
recommended. 

PLAIN WELSH RAREBIT 

To one large cup of finely grated cheese, add one well- 
beaten egg and enough milk to make the three a cream. If 
you like any other seasoning, add it. Pour into a saucepan, 
let it boil up once and then pour over hot buttered toast 

WELSH RAREBIT FOR SUNDAY SUPPER 

To a tablespoon of hot butter in a saucepan add four 
tablespoons of good American cream cheese. Stir till the 
cheese is melted, and then add a cup of cream, quarter of a 
teaspoon of salt, a dash of cayenne or paprika, and two eggs 
well beaten. Stir all thoroughly. Have crisp, hot toast, cut in 
triangles or fingers. Spread the cheese mixture over the 
toast, and serve at once.

THE SCIENCE OF SANDWICH-MAKING 

THE old-fashioned sandwich — two thick wedges of bread, 
erratically buttered, hard of crust, exuding mustard, and 
with frills of ham or corned beef about the edge — has been rele- 
gated to the past by the arrival of the meat-chopper. The 
only places where it seems to linger is at railroad lunch coun- 
ters; occasionally, too, it reappears at a Sunday-school picnic. 
The sandwiches of the past were of half a dozen varieties, the 
filling of a modern sandwich is limited only by what you have 
on hand. Fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables, eggs, nuts, fruit, cheese, 
and pickles may be utilized alone, or combined, and the result, 
when prepared by a skilful cook, is a dainty and delicious 
morsel. 

The first subject, when one takes up sandwich-making, is 
bread. If many sandwiches are required, as for a reception 
or picnic, I prefer to bake the bread specially for them ; there 
is less waste and the work is so much easier. For this pur- 
pose I keep on hand plenty of baking powder cans, one-pound 
and half-pound sizes, and also a few oblong tins which have 
held one pound of cocoa. Nothing can excel these as molds 
for baking bread for picnic sandwiches ; it is tender, almost 
crustless, it needs no trimming to make two slices accord in 
size and it bakes or steams much more quickly than in larger 
tins. 

Make the bread twenty-four hours before it is required 
and try to have it fine-grained. Fill the cans half full of dough 



SANDWICHES 215 

and set to rise. When almost at the top of the tins put to 
bake with the Uds off. When you have brown bread mixture, 
fill three-quarters full — it does not rise so much as bread which 
has yeast in it. Slip the small loaves out of the tins as soon 
as taken from the oven or steamer and set on a wire stand to 
cool ; then wrap in towels and put away in the bread-box 
until required. 

The next consideration is the butter. Put a pound of 
butter (if you have many sandwiches to make) in a mixing 
bowl and with a slitted wooden spoon beat it thoroughly to 
a fine, light cream, exactly as for cake making. The butter 
is much easier to spread, it is more economical, then it is ready 
to divide into portions and blend with anything to make what 
is called a flavored butter, the most delicate of all fillings. 

Before preparing the sandwiches, if they are to be used at 
a luncheon or entertainment where other dishes accompany 




A Slitted Wooden Spoon 

them, be careful that the flavoring is different from the salad 
with which they are served. It is really in better taste to offer 
nothing with a salad or cold meat except plain sandwiches of 
bread and butter ; still, fashion seems to demand a flavored 
nibble as a salad accompaniment. Fish, lobster, or shrimp 
salads are most appetizing with sandwiches of Boston brown 
bread holding a tender lettuce-leaf or a sprig of watercress 
dipped in mayonnaise. Serve sandwiches of mild cheese 
flavored by mustard or vinegar with green salads. White 
bread sandwiches holding tender young nasturtium leaves be- 
tween the buttered folds go well with salads of meat or fish. 
Garnish a plateful of this variety with a few nasturtium leaves 
and blossoms. Finely cut peppergrass, chives, endive, or 
celery are all fitting accompaniments to sandwiches, which 
are offered with a meat or chicken salad. Cucumbers and to- 



216 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

matoes thinly sliced and spread with mayonnaise make a 
delicious bite between buttered bread. Cut with a small cookie 
cutter rounds of bread, slightly larger than the slice of tomato 
or cucumber, and put the vegetable between them. These, as 
well as the herb sandwiches, must not be made until imme- 
diately before serving. 

Cheese, which is generally the first course in a sandwich 
menu, may be spread between folds of white, graham, or en- 
tire wheat bread or delicate crackers. Roquefort, fromage de 
Brie, or any of the stronger cheeses, may be flavored with 
finely chopped chives or parsley and creamed butter. Combine 
with a milder cheese, chopped olives, walnut meats, anchovy 
essence and a dash of mustard, paprika, and salt. Grate hard 
cheese and mash soft cheese with a spoon, afterward rub to a 
paste with mayonnaise or butter and flavoring. The delicious 
little cream or Neufchatel cheeses may be blended with 
chopped walnuts, given a bit of seasoning by Parmesan cheese, 
also a hint of lemon- juice and paprika. 

Under the head of sandwiches is a long list of possibilities. 
They include meat, fish, egg, as well as fillings obtained from 
chopped olives and pickles, or some strong seasoning, curry, 
caviare, or anchovy. For all sorts of meat use a chopper, grind- 
ing with the finest knife. It provides a paste which, blended 
with mayonnaise, is as easy to spread on bread as butter. 
Scores of receipts might be ofifered to direct this blending 
process, but the clever cook, with her own palate as criterion, 
can easily adapt a few suggestions to the materials on hand. 
Chicken combines well with celery, chopped nuts, and olives. 
The most delicate chicken sandwich I know is seasoned with 
celery salt and moistened with thick whipped cream instead of 
mayonnaise. Ham paste is blended with mayonnaise, mustard, 
chopped olives, and gherkins. Veal paste may be seasoned 
like chicken — indeed one can scarcely tell the difference be- 
tween the two fillings. Roast beef, corned beef, lamb, and 
poultry paste make good sandwiches. If you have not enough 
of one meat add to it another which harmonizes in flavor; for 
instance, veal goes well with any sort of poultry, while tongue 



SANDWICHES 217 

and ham make a good mixture. If remains of roast beef, lamb, 
or corned beef are small, chop and blend each separately ; 
nothing seems to assimilate well with red-blooded meats. Use 
mustard, a few drops of onion extract, and chopped pickles as 
flavoring. They are better moistened with creamed butter 
than with mayonnaise. Put lobster, shrimp, or crab meat 
through the chopper. Cold fish or canned salmon is better 
delicately picked to flakes with a fork. Sardines, anchovies, 
and salt fish make tasty picnic sandwiches. Pound them to a 
paste and give a touch of acidity by lemon- juice or chopped 
pickle. Eggs should be hard-boiled; allow to become thor- 
oughly cold, then put through a chopper, mix with mayonnaise 
or butter and season well. 

Then one comes to sweet sandwiches — the variety is almost 
unlimited. Figs, dates, prunes, raisins, nuts, preserved ginger, 







Fancy Sandwich-Cutters 

and candied peel are some of the fruits which may be chopped, 
sweetened, moistened with whipped cream, lemon, orange, or 
pineapple juice and spread between folds of white bread. 
When preparing them for an entertainment, cut heart, dia- 
mond, or club shaped, and on top of each lay something which 
suggests the filling — an English walnut meat, a shred of green 
citron peel, or half a maraschino cherry, dipped in icing to 
make them stick. When you wish to roll sandwiches, use 
fresh bread, spread very lightly with the filling and pin into 
shape with a fine toothpick. 

It is quite easy to keep sandwiches fresh some hours be- 
fore they are required. Wring a napkin as dry as possible 
from hot water — a good plan is to put it through the wringer — 
wrap the sandwiches in it very carefully, then cover in a stone 
jar or something which will exclude the air.

ALMOND SANDWICHES 
Chop to a mince half a pound of blanched almonds. Add 
half a teaspoon of salt, and mix in a small cup of thick cream 
till you have a paste. Spread on buttered slices of graham 
or whole wheat bread, 

BAKED BEAN SANDWICHES 

Take thin slices of graham bread, butter, and spread with 
baked beans which you have slightly mashed and dampened 
with their own liquor. Add a little finely minced or sliced 
onion, a drop or two of vinegar or lemon- juice, and a dash 
of salt. Press the bread together. 

BEEF SANDWICHES 

A beef sandwich may be made from cold roast beef as a 
filling, or from cold boiled beef. The natural accompaniments 
of beef are onions, tomatoes, and horseradish. If you use 
onion with the beef, scrape or chop it fine, add a little salt 
and pepper and spread over the beef after it has been laid on 
the bread, and before the second slice is added. If you use 
sliced tomato, also have that well seasoned with salt, pepper, 
and a drop of lemon- juice or vinegar before laying on the beef. 
If you use grated horseradish follow the Russian custom and 
mix the horseradish with thick cream, a little salted, spread on 
the lightly buttered bread, lay in the trim and filling of beef, 
and press on the upper slice. 

RAW BEEF SANDWICHES 

Mince the beef you use very fine. Free it from filaments or 
threads, mix in finely minced onion to the proportion your taste 
directs, and season with salt. vSpread on graham or white 
bread, set in the ice-box, and serve cold, 

CHEESE SANDWICHES 
Make into a paste quarter of a pound of American cheese, 
a heaping tablespoon of butter, a teaspoon of mustard and a 



SANDWICHES 219 

few drops of wine or cider vinegar. Spread on thin slices 
of bread. 

CREAM CHEESE SANDWICHES 

These are made hke the foregoing, and the pot or cream 
cheese is spread before the lettuce leaves are put on. Chopped 
olives wet with a little cream and paprika are sometimes used 
instead of lettuce leaves. 



CHEESE AND WALNUT SANDWICHES 

Slice thin whole wheat bread, or graham or white bread. 

Butter, and spread with cream cheese in which you have 

mixed or pounded English walnut meats, and a dash of 
cayenne. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES 

Chop fine the meat of a chicken — for sandwiches the white 
meat is preferable — and with it a few olives as a savory. 
Stir in a mayonnaise to hold all together and spread on but- 
tered bread. 

CHICKEN CURRY SANDWICHES 

Mince cold chicken, pound to a paste with its curry sauce, 
and spread on buttered slices of bread, 

DATE AND FIG SANDWICHES 

Chop fine either dates or figs, moisten with cream or hot 
water, add a few drops of lemon or orange- juice, and spread 
upon thin buttered slices of either graham or white bread. 

EGG SANDWICHES 

Rub to a paste the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs. Mix 
in a teaspoon of made mustard, a little salt, and a few drops of 
vinegar. Chop fine the whites of the eggs, add to the yellow 
paste and spread on thin slices of buttered bread. 



22U THE HOME COOK BOOK 

EGG, BREAD, AND SARDINE SANDWICHES 

Chop hard-boiled eggs not very fine, and with them half 
as many skinned sardines. Season with salt and pepper, and 
when well mixed spread thick on thin slices of brown or 
graham bread. Press the sandwiches together firmly. 

FISH SANDWICHES 

Fish sandwiches offer a happy way of utilizing remains of 
boiled fish, such as salmon, lobster, sole, etc. They may be 
made of the fish minced, or of the fish still kept in solid form. 
If the fish is minced, season it well, make it to a paste with 
butter, and spread on buttered slices of whole wheat or graham 
bread. Between the slices of bread a little scraped onion may 
also be added, or, if the taste prefers, cool slices of cucumber 
which have been soaked in a French dressing. If the fish 
is not minced, but kept in solid meat, soak the meat well in a 
French dressing before it is laid between buttered slices of 
graham or whole wheat bread. Here again scrapings of onion 
or slices of cucumber are not amiss. 

GINGER SANDWICHES 

Chop the ginger fine, soften it with thick cream, and 
spread on either whole wheat, graham, or white bread. 
Candied fruits, such as cherries, pears, orange peel, may be 
used in the same way. 

HAM SANDWICHES 

Cut pieces of cold boiled ham, keeping some of the fat. 
Chop fine, and mix it in a small quantity of mustard which 
has been mixed up with water, a little sugar, and salt. Add 
to the ham a small quantity of chopped cucumber pickle, and 
stir all together. Slice two pieces of white bread thin, turn 
so that the pieces match, butter the bread, and spread the 
ham on one slice thickly. Turn the other slice over it, and 
cut in one or two pieces, according to the size of the slice. 



SANDWICHES 221 

HAM AND ONION SANDWICHES 

Between thin slices of buttered rye bread lay a thin slice 
of boiled ham, touch the ham lightly with made mustard, 
and press the bread together. A very thin slice of Bermuda 
onion may be laid on the ham, if the taste so directs. 

JUNE ROSE SANDWICHES 

New made and unsalted butter when packed overnight 
with fragrant rose leaves absorbs their perfume. Cut deli- 
cate slices of white bread in fingers or dollar sizes, spread 
with the butter, lay on a few petals, and press together. 

LETTUCE SANDWICHES 

These sandwiches are made of slices of white bread but- 
tered and holding between them two or three crisp, white 
lettuce leaves on which a pinch of salt and a few drops of 
lemon-juice or a spoonful of mayonnaise have been placed. 
Or graham bread is used. The lettuce leaves are sometimes 
cut in ribbons instead of being kept whole. 

LOBSTER SANDWICHES 

Mince a boiled lobster. Season it to your taste with minced 
onion, salt, pepper, and lemon- juice. This may be put on the 
under slice of bread, and have for its upper part a slice of 
bread and butter holding a small lettuce leaf. 

MUSHROOM SANDWICHES 

Cook the mushrooms, cut small, and when tender add a 
little cream and a seasoning of crisp bacon cut in small pieces. 
Season also with salt and pepper and spread on thin slices 
of bread. 

MUTTON SANDWICHES 

Like beef sandwiches, these may be made from either the 
roast or boiled meat. Again arises the question of what is a 



222 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

natural savory herb or vegetable to accompany the meat. 
Chopped olives may be laid on the slice of mutton, or capers 
minced and mixed with a little cream, or thin slices of tomato 
which have soaked in a French dressing, or slices of crisp 
cucumber which have had the same saturation. 

NUT AND CHEESE SANDWICHES 
For these you may use pecans, English walnuts, almonds, 
or our own hickory nuts. Pound to a paste or chop fine half 
a cup of the nut meats. Mix thoroughly with a roll of 
Neufchatel cheese, add half a teaspoon of salt in the mixing 
and spread on thin slices of whole wheat, graham, rye, or 
white bread. 

NUT AND FIG SANDWICHES 
Take equal parts of English walnut meats and figs. 
Chop the walnuts fine. Also chop the figs and set them to 
cook slowly with a little water. When they have dissolved 
into a paste add the chopped nut meats, squeeze in a flavoring 
of lemon or orange juice and spread between thin slices of 
graham bread. 

OLIVE AND CUCUMBER SANDWICHES 
For these use graham or white bread. Chop together 
equal parts of olives and small cucumber pickles. Stir them 
together with a mayonnaise dressing and spread on slices of 
bread. 

OLIVE AND MINT SANDWICHES 
Use equal quantities of chopped mint and olives, and let 
them stand a few hours in a French dressing. Take thin slices 
of graham bread, butter, spread with the mint and olives, 
and press together. 

OYSTER SANDWICHES 
Take two dozen oysters, chop fine, add salt and cayenne, 
and heat in a saucepan. Drop in a tablespoon of butter and 



SANDWICHES 223 

three tablespoons of fine breadcrumbs. Cook three or four 
minutes and cool for spreading on thin slices of buttered 
bread. 

PEANUT SANDWICHES 

Take fresh-roasted peanuts, chop fine, mix with a ma- 
yonnaise dressing and spread on thin slices of graham, whole 
wheat, or white bread. 

SARDINE SANDWICHES 

Take boneless sardines — or if the more common sardine, 
scrape oflf oil and skin, open lengthwise, sprinkle with a few 
drops of lemon- juice, and lay between slices of thinly buttered 
graham or white bread. 

TONGUE AND TOMATO SANDWICHES 

Upon a thin buttered slice of white bread lay cold boiled 
tongue cut in delicate slices, and upon each slice of tongue 
a thin slice of tomato sprinkled with a dash of salt and pep- 
per. Cover with another buttered slice and press together.

TO MAKE DRY YEAST 

AVE one heaping coffee saucer of flour. Boil one cup of 
hops in enough water to scald this flour. Mix the water 
with the flour. Let cool. Stir in a cup of dry yeast, wet 
with enough water to soak it. Set to rise in a warm place 
till light. Then stir in cornmeal till it is thick enough to make 
into small cakes and dry, but do not heat in drying. 

In making this begin the work in the morning so that you 
can see it all accomplished before night. 

PERENNIAL YEAST 

A simple and effective yeast of home brew is called peren- 
nial because it may be made to last some time. To dwellers 
remote from groceries it is of considerable value. When once 
you have started it, keep it by renewing it each week. To 
start it dissolve a cake of compressed yeast in two tablespoons 
of the water in which you cooked your potatoes for dinner. 
Do not use the water when it is hot ; let it become lukewarm. 
Next fill half full of lukewarm potato water a glass preserving 
jar — a quart jar. Add half a cup of granulated sugar, and 
when it is dissolved in the potato water add the dissolved 



YEAST 225 

yeast. Stir together, and set the can, loosely covered, in a 
warm but not hot place, where the yeast can work. When 
the contents of the jar have become light, seal up the can and 
set it away. The day before you want to make bread fill up the 
can with lukewarm potato water, add half a cup of granulated 
sugar, and let stand for twenty-four hours, when you will have 
a can full of foaming white yeast. Beat and use half a can 
of the yeast for making three loaves of bread. Mix the bread 
at once and use as much lukewarm water as yeast. Seal up 
the can from which you took the yeast and set it away. When 
again you want to make bread take the day before for filling 
again with lukewarm potato water and half a cup of granulated 
sugar, and allow fermentation for twenty-four hours, as above 
directed. 

POTATO YEAST 

Take one quart of sliced potatoes. Wash in cold water 
and put in a large tin saucepan. Tie up in a square cloth a 
bunch of loose hops, as many as you would gather in your 
fingers. If the pressed hops are used (which are not quite 
as good) take half a package. Cover the potatoes with two 
quarts of hot water, in which put the hop bag. Boil slowly 
until the potatoes are soft enough to mash. Place a colander 
over a large crock. Put into it a full teacup of flour. Pour 
over the flour the boiling water and potatoes — to scald it. Mash 
all through the colander with a potato masher. Wash the 
saucepan in which the potatoes boiled and have it ready for 
use. Move the colander from the crock to the saucepan while 
the potato is being pressed through. Add one pint of 
warm water for that which has boiled away. When all is 
pressed through in the saucepan, wash the colander, potato 
masher, and crock. Set the colander over the crock. Press 
the potato water through again. Have ready two cakes of 
compressed yeast dissolved in cold water. Now add to the 
potato three-quarters of a teacup of white sugar, in which 
mix one teaspoon of ground ginger and one iron spoon, heap- 
ing, of salt. When this is mixed and all is cool to lukewarm. 



226 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

stir in the yeast. Set in a warm place (but not hot) to rise. 
Cover. When very light put away in Mason glass jars with 
covers. Fill the jars three-quarters full, as at first. The yeast 
will rise more. Set away in a cold place or in an ice-box. 
When yeast is made again use one yeast cake and half a tea- 
cup of potato yeast. 

BREAD 

Dissolve two cakes and a half of the ounce yeast cakes of 
Fleischmami's make. To dissolve them put in three table- 
spoons of cold water. Take a quart of blood-warm water and 
a heaping teaspoon of salt, and add the dissolved yeast cakes. 
Have flour sifted into a pan or bowl, and stir the yeast mix- 
ture in till you have a dough stiff enough to lift from the bowl. 
Lift the dough to your bread board, having first floured it 
well, and knead the dough thoroughly, putting to it more 
flour until it does not stick to your fingers or to your bread 
board. With hot drippings grease a warm bowl, set the dough 
in the bowl and grease over the top of the dough. Cover to 
protect from cold and set in a warm place to rise — not hot, 
merely warm. In about three hours the dough will have risen. 
Form it into loaves, brush the loaves with hot drippings, set to 
rise in a warm place for an hour, and bake till a golden 
brown. 

BREAD MADE WITH POTATOES 

Boil three large potatoes. Mash them while hot, adding 
a piece of butter half as big as an egg, one teaspoon of sugar, 
and half a teaspoon of salt. Mash all together perfectly 
smooth. Take a pint of warm water, half of it pour over the 
potatoes, moisten a teacup and a half of flour with the other 
half. Beat the flour batter well to remove all lumps, and add 
it to the potato batter. Then add half a teacup of yeast, or 
one-third of a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in half a 
cup of warm water. Add also half a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in half a cup of warm water. Beat together this thin 
batter and set in a warm place, where the bottom of its dish will 



BREAD 227 

be kept warm overnight. Next morning sift into your bread 
tray a quart and a half of flour and half a teaspoon of salt. 
Make a hole in the middle of the flour and pour in the sponge. 
If the risen sponge is good it will be full of bubbles. Knead 
well — five or ten minutes — with both hands, but keep the 
dough soft, and use on your hands only as much flour as is 
necessary. After sprinkling flour all round, over and under the 



Rolling Pin (even diameter) 

dough, cover with a cloth and set in a warm place. It should 
rise to double its size in about an hour. Knead again and 
divide into two loaves. Set the pans in a warm place until the 
loaves have risen to the top. Bake in a quick oven about 
half an hour. 

If you wish to make biscuits, after the first kneading take 
about half the dough and roll out the biscuits. Let them rise 
a few minutes in a warm place and bake in a quick oven. 

BROWN BREAD 

Mix together one cup and a half of cornmeal, one scant 
cup of wheat flour, one cup and a half of graham flour, one 
cup of New Orleans molasses, one teaspoon of salt, and two 
teacups of buttermilk. Beat well together and add two tea- 
spoons of soda dissolved in cold water. Mix again. Bake in 
one-pound baking-powder cans in a rather hot and steady 
oven. Set the covers on the cans. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD 

Thoroughly mix together two cups of sour milk, one cup 
of sweet milk, two cups of Indian meal, two cups of graham 
flour, three-fourths of a cup of molasses, one teaspoon of salt, 
and one teaspoon of soda. Pour in a greased brown bread 
mold, fasten the cover on tight, bake in a moderate or slow 
oven three or four hours or longer. 



228 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BUTTERMILK BREAD 

Bring to boil two quarts of buttermilk. Have in an 
earthen jar or crock which is perfectly sweet from washing and 
scouring one teacup of sifted flour. Over this flour pour and 
stir in the hot buttermilk. When cooled to blood-heat stir in 
half a cup of fine yeast and flour enough to make a stiff 
batter. Stir thoroughly and beat thoroughly and set in a warm 
place. Next morning sift flour in your bread bowl or pan, 
pour in the batter and let stand an hour. Then mix and knead 
long and thoroughly. Set to rise, and when light quickly 
make into loaves ; let stand a few minutes and bake in a mod- 
erately heated oven. 

GRAHAM BREAD 

Mix into three pints of graham flour one heaping teaspoon 
of salt, one scant teacup of molasses, and one cup and a half 
of buttermilk. Beat well together and add one heaping tea- 




Boston Brown Bread Mold 

spoon of soda dissolved in cold water. Grease the pans well 
and bake in separate loaves. Bake slowly for two hours. Set 
a pan of warm water in the upper oven above the bread. 

RYE BREAD 

Mix a large spoon of butter with a large spoon of sugar 
and a teaspoon of salt. Over this pour a pint of boiling milk, 
cover and set to cool. When lukewarm add a teacup of lively 
yeast — or one yeast cake dissolved in a cup of warm water. 



BREAD 229 

Add also wheat flour till you have a thin batter. Set over- 
night. Next morning- stir in rye flour to make a soft dough 
and set to rise. When the dough is light, add rye flour enough 
to make a firm dough. Set to rise again. Again knead well, 
make into loaves, and bake in an even oven. 

RYE AND INDIAN BREAD 

Dissolve a yeast cake in a cup and a half of water and 
add enough wheat flour to make a sponge. Set to rise over- 
night well covered in a warm place. Next morning scald 
together a quart of water and a pint of molasses and stir in 
four pints and a half of cornmeal. When this has cooled 
to lukewarm stir it in the sponge, and then add a heaping pint 
of ryemeal, a pint of wheat flour breadcrumbs soaked in 
water and mashed smooth, and lastly a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in two tablespoons of warm water. Stir alt^together 
thoroughly and set in a warm place to rise. When light, 
separate into loaves, let rise again, and bake in a sure, mod- 
erate oven three hours. 

SALT-RISING BREAD 

Scald one cup of fresh milk, and when it is slightly cooled, 
pour it over two tablespoons of cornmeal in a pitcher. Beat 
well together, cover the pitcher with a saucer and stand it 
overnight in a pan or bowl of warm water in a warm place. 
Next morning add a cup of warm water, one teaspoon of salt, 
half a teaspoon of soda and flour to make a batter. Set in a 
pan of warm water and in a warm place till light, which will 
probably be in two or three hours. Put one quart of flour in 
a pan, add a tablespoon of lard and one of salt, pour in the 
batter and knead well. Make into loaves, let rise, and bake. 

Keep this kind of bread very warm all the time it is mak- 
ing, but do not spoil the ferment by scalding it. The fermenta- 
tion is supposed to be from germs or bacteria the sponge 
absorbs from the air. 



230 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 

Mix through one quart of entire wheat flour one teaspoon 
of salt, two tablespoons of molasses, and one-quarter of a cake 
of compressed yeast dissolved in cold water. Mix and knead 
four or five minutes. Set to rise at night in a warm place. 
In the morning knead five minutes more. Divide in two 
parts and put in greased pans. Let rise until light, which will 
take almost an hour. Bake one hour in a rather brisk, steady 
heat. 

BREAD STICKS 

When you are making yeast bread, leave out a small por- 
tion of the dough. Cut from this small pieces, roll out till 
twice as long and about the thickness of a common lead pencil. 
Set to rise for half an hour, and bake in a hot oven about 
a quarter of an hour. A long, narrow dripping-pan will serve 
for a pan. The sticks should be a soft crust brown all round. 

HOT CROSS BUNS 

Mix together one pound of flour, quarter of a pound of 
sugar, a pinch of cloves and of mace, quarter of a teaspoon 
of cinnamon, and half a pound of currants which have been 
washed and dried. Next dissolve a yeast cake in a cup of 
warm water, and add a cup of scalded milk. Make a hole in 
the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the liquid. Grad- 
ually work in the flour, and after thoroughly mixing, cover 
and set in a warm place to rise. When very light, work in 
two heaping tablespoons of butter, knead and again set to rise. 
If on this kneading the dough is not soft, work in a little 
scalded milk. After the second rising, form your buns, and 
set the pan in a warm place for half an hour. Mark the top of 
each bun with a cross, using a knife. Afterward brush with 
the white of an egg and sprinkle with sugar. 

CINNAMON LOAF 

On a breadmaking day, when your dough has risen and is 
light, take out a lump weighing two pounds. Cut up quarter 



ROLLS 231 

of a pound of butter, slightly warmed, in a cup of milk and 
beat in three eggs. Stir this mixture gradually into the dough 
and mix thoroughly, also adding half a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in a tablespoon of lukewarm water. In one cup of 
sugar have mixed one tablespoon of powdered cinnamon. 
Form the bread in the shape of a loaf, make deep incisions in 
the top of the loaf, and press the cinnamon and sugar into 
the cuts, pulling up the dough over the little pockets of sea- 
soning. Put the loaf in a greased pan and bake with the other 
bread. It is nice eaten warm for supper or lunch. Do not 
cut in pieces. Cut the crust and then break irregularly. 

ROLLS 

Mix through one pint and a half of flour one teaspoon of 
salt, one teaspoon of sugar, one beaten egg, one pint of luke- 
warm milk, and three-quarters of a compressed yeast cake, 
or half a teacup of potato yeast. Beat all together thoroughly. 
Set to rise in a warm place and cover. When very light, 
knead well, adding enough more flour to make a delicate dough 
for biscuit. Set to rise again. When light, make into rolls 
oblong in shape. Put in greased pans and when the rolls rise 
almost even together they are ready to bake. Dust the top 
with a piece of soft paper dipped in melted butter. Bake in 
a steady oven for half an hour until a light brown. 

VIENNA ROLLS 

Mix a cup of lively yeast in a quart of lukewarm milk. 
Then stir in a quart of flour and set to rise in a warm place. 
In two or three hours, add flour enough to make a stiff dough, 
add also a tablespoon of sugar and the same of salt. Set to 
rise again, and after four or five hours take on a board and roll 
in thin sheets, not more than quarter of an inch thick. From 
these sheets cut triangles. Roll up the triangles from the base 
so that the apex will come in the centre of the roll. Bend 
them in quarter-moon shape, brush with melted butter, let 



232 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

rise for half an hour, and bake. Instead of forming the dough 
from triangles the rolls may be made in ordinary form. 

RUSK 

Make a sponge overnight of one teacup of flour, half a 
teaspoon of salt, and half a pint of lukewarm water or milk. 
Dissolve a compressed yeast cake in cold water. Add this to 
the sponge, and beat very hard. Cover well and set to rise in 
a warm place overnight. In the morning, add half a teacup 
of melted butter (not hot), half a teacup of sugar, and two 
beaten eggs. Stir all together and beat thoroughly. If more 
flour is needed to make a delicate soft dough which you can 
knead a little, add it. Roll out half an inch thick and cut 
with biscuit cutter, or make into oblong rolls. Put in a deep, 
greased pan. Let rise nearly to the top of the pan. Rusk needs 
to be lighter than bread rolls. When ready to bake, dip a 
soft piece of paper in egg and sugar beaten together and 
dust the top with the mixture. Bake in a steady oven about 
half an hour. If they bake too fast, set a pan of warm water 
over them in the upper oven. A small sifting of grated nutmeg 
on top the rusk is liked by many. 

BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT 

Measure one quart of sifted flour and three heaping tea- 
spoons of baking powder. To this add one tablespoon of 
lard and mix quickly through the flour with the tips of the 




Biscuit Cutters 

fingers. Wet with one teacup of milk and water mixed or all 
milk, or all water. Of course, milk is the best. Wash the 
dough off the hands before mixing, and sprinkle the pastry 
board lightly with flour. Also dip the hand into the flour to 
prevent any sticking to the board or the hands. Now turn 



BISCUITS 233 

the dough on the board, turn it over, knead just twice to have 
it smooth; then flour the rolling-pin and roll out half an inch 
thick. Cut the biscuit with a cutter the size you prefer and 
put into pans that are neither floured nor greased. Let them 
stand fifteen minutes before baking, and bake a light brown in 
a quick oven, which will take about fifteen minutes. 

BREAKFAST BISCUIT 
Beat two eggs, half a teaspoon of salt, a heaping tablespoon 
of butter, and a pint of milk with two pounds of flour. Stir 
in three-fourths of a cup of yeast or a cake of compressed 
yeast dissolved in a little water. Set to rise overnight. In the 
morning form into small biscuits and bake. 

SOUR-CREAM BISCUIT 
Take two cups of flour, half a teaspoon of salt, and a tea- 
spoon each of sugar and of baking-powder and sift together. 
Dissolve half a teaspoon of soda in a tablespoon of cold water 
and beat it into half a cup of sour milk and half a cup of 
cream. Put the cream mixture to the flour when the soda is 
thoroughly worked in it. Stir fast with a spoon and put the 
dough on a molding board which you have spread with flour. 
Pat into a cake. Do not use much flour except to keep the 
dough from sticking to the hand. Cut in small biscuit, lay in 
a hot greased pan, and bake in a hot oven. If you wish to use 
all sour milk instead of cream and milk, mix a kitchen spoon 
of lard or drippings with the flour before putting in the sour 
milk. 

BUTTERMILK BISCUIT 
Follow the foregoing directions, using a tablespoon of but- 
ter, lard, or drippings, and mixing this in the flour before 
adding the buttermilk. 

MARYLAND BISCUIT 
Sift one teaspoon of salt with one quart of flour. Work 
into half of this two tablespoons of the best leaf lard, cutting 



284 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the lard into little bits and rubbing- into the flour. Mix in 
also one cup of warmed milk. Add by degrees, a spoonful at 
a time, the other half of your flour. By this time the dough 
is thoroughly worked up. Lay the dough upon the board and 
beat it hard with the end of the rolling-pin for about five 
minutes. Roll out very thin, cut in shape, stick with a fork, 
and bake in a hot oven. 

QUICK HOT RAISED BISCUIT 
If you wish to get hot biscuit for a meal for three or four 
persons and only five hours ofif, take quarter of a cake of 
compressed yeast and rub it into a tablespoon of sweet milk 
until perfectly smooth. Add this to a pint of flour, a teaspoon 
of salt and a tablespoon of butter, all of which you have first 
rubbed thoroughly together. Then a^ milk enough to soften 
and combine all the ingredients into a biscuit dough. Shape 
into biscuit, set in a warm place for three or four hours to 
rise, and when they are light and pufTy, bake from half to 
three-quarters of an hour. 

VELVET BISCUIT 
Into a pint of warm milk put two well-beaten eggs, half 
a cake of compressed yeast, a teaspoon of melted butter, and 
flour enough to make a soft dough. Set to rise. When light, 
work down, adding flour and salt. When Hght again, make 
into small biscuit, and set them close together in pans. When 
light, bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. If the rising is kept 
warm, it will take about six hours to make the biscuit. 

CORN BREAD 
Mix into one pint and a half of cornmeal one teaspoon of 
salt, one teaspoon of sugar, and two eggs not beaten. Beat 
the batter hard to lighten the eggs. Add not quite two pints of 
buttermilk, one small teaspoon of butter, one small teaspoon of 
lard, melted ; and, last, one even teaspoon of soda. Stir all 
together. Have ready an oblong granite pan, into which put 
one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of lard. Set this 



CAKES 235 

on the stove to heat. Melt the butter and lard in it. When 
the pan is hot and the grease melted, pour in the mixture and 
lightly whip the grease through with a fork. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven three-quarters of an hour. If the oven is too hot 
the bread will crack on top. After the bread is browned and 
done, set a pie-pan upside down under it in the oven. Over 
it in the upper oven put a pan of hot water. Cold water would 
cool the oven at once. Leave the bread in the oven about 
ten minutes longer. The overbake to corn bread is what gives 
the sweet corn flavor. This will not be found if the bread is 
taken from the oven as soon as it is done. 

SOFT CORN BREAD 
Heat two cups of milk in a double-boiler, and when hot 
stir in slowly two-thirds of a cup of cornmeal. The heat of 
the milk will expand the meal and you will have a mush. Take 
from the stove and add half a teaspoon of salt and the yolks 
of three eggs. Stir together thoroughly and, lastly, add the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Have ready a hot 
baking-pan well greased, tip in the mixture and bake twenty 
to twenty-five minutes. Serve at once, not in square cut 
pieces, for the pressure of the knife might make the bread 
fall, but in irregular pieces as it breaks in Hfting. Eat with 
butter, and if you like it sweet add maple syrup. 

JOHNNY BREAD 
Mix three cups of Indian meal with one cup of white flour. 
Also mix one-third of a cup of molasses, a teaspoon of salt, 
a pint of sour milk or buttermilk, and two well-beaten eggs, 
and beat into the meal and the flour. Dissolve in a couple of 
tablespoons of the milk a teaspoon of soda, add to the batter, 
mix in thoroughly, spread on a baking-pan and bake in a hot 
oven. Eat with butter and syrup or molasses. 

SOUR MILK CORN CAKES 
Sift together three-fourths of a cup of flour, three-fourths 
of a cup of cornmeal, a tablespoon of sugar, three-fourths of 



230 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

a teaspoon of soda dissolved in a tablespoon of cold water, 
and half a teaspoon of salt. Pour over the mixture a cup of 
sour milk and a tablespoon of melted lard or drippings. Beat 
well together, stir in a well-beaten egg, and bake in well- 
greased hot popover cups or gem pans. 

CORN DODGERS 

Measure one pint of cornmeal. Mix into it one teaspoon of 
salt and one teaspoon of sugar. Scald the meal, pouring over 
it about three-quarters of a pint of boiling water. Add one 
beaten egg and one heaping teaspoon and a half of baking 
powder. Stir well together. Add very carefully a very little 
more hot water, so that the batter will be just stiff enough 
to drop from a spoon and keep its shape. The Vv/^ater will 
have to be added slowly, as the batter can easily be made too 
thin. Have ready a frying-pan with just enough hot lard to 
keep the dodgers from sticking. Drop in tablespoons full. 
Do not put too many dodgers in at one time. Cook slowly in 
order to have them well done. Turn them from side to side, 
and brown a light brown. Keep some melted lard ready in 
a cup to add more as you need it. When the dodgers are 
done, set where they will keep hot. This quantity will make 
about fourteen dodgers. 

CORN GEMS 

Mix through two cups of cornmeal one teaspoon of salt. 
Put the meal in a bowl, a piece of butter the size of an egg in 
the centre, and pour over it one cup of boiling milk. Stir 
well. Then add one teacup of cold milk, three beaten eggs, 
one teaspoon of salt, and one cup of flour. To this stir in 
two teaspoons of baking powder. Beat well, mix thoroughly. 
Pour into hot greased gem pans, and bake in a quick oven 
half an hour. 

CORNMEAL MUFFINS 

Mix into two tin pint cups of cornmeal one heaping tea- 
spoon of salt, one heaping teaspoon of sugar, and two eggs not 



MUFFINS 



2'67 



beaten. Measure one tin pint cup and a half of buttermilk, 
add enough of this to the meal to make a batter, stirring hard 
in order to beat the eggs. Next add one heaping teaspoon 
of melted butter, and then stir in the remainder of the butter- 
milk, and lastly, one even teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold 
water. Have the muffin pans very hot, grease well, fill and 
bake slowly a light brown in a moderate oven. 

GRAHAM GEMS 
Mix through three teacups of graham flour one teaspoon 
of salt, the beaten yolks of three eggs, one tablespoon of 
melted butter, and one pint of milk. Next put in the whites 




of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth and two teaspoons of baking 
powder. Mix carefully. Bake in well-greased gem pans 
thirty minutes in a quick oven. 

GRAHAM MUFFINS 
Sift two teaspoons of baking powder and half a teaspoon of 
salt into one cup of flour. Add a cup and a half of graham 
flour. Stir in a cup of fresh milk and then a beaten egg, and 
beat well till the mixture is smooth. Have your muffin tins 
warm, drop in the batter till they are little more than half 
full, and then bake in a well-heated oven till done — twenty 
or twenty-five minutes. 



GLUTEN WAFERS 

Put in a bowl a cup of tepid milk, sprinkle in gluten flour 
till you have a dough. Knead well, take on your floured board 



238 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and roll very thin. Cut out with a biscuit cutter and bake 
brown upon floured baking-pans in a moderate oven. 

OATMEAL CAKES 
Mix into cold oatmeal a small quantity of milk and 
enough white flour to soften, so that it can be made in small, 
flat cakes. Put in a greased pan, and bake in the oven to a 
light brown. 

OAT MUFFINS 
Pour over two-thirds of a cup of rolled oats, one cup of 
scalded milk. Let stand five minutes, then add three table- 
spoons of sugar, half a teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons 
of melted butter. Sift in one and a half cups of flour with 
four teaspoons of baking powder, beat well, stir in a well- 
beaten egg and bake in greased hot muffin tins. 

OATMEAL WAFERS 

Take what oatmeal you wish to use, add a little salt and 
stir in boiling hot water till you have a thick batter or dough. 
Flour your board, put on the dough, knead it dry, roll as 
thin as possible, and cut in round cakes, first dipping your 
biscuit cutter into flour. Then on a hot griddle cook the 
wafers till they are brown and crisp. When they are browned 
on one side turn and brown on the other. 

SUPPER POPOVER 

Sift three cups of flour with a teaspoon of salt. Little by 
little add three cups of milk, and when you have a smooth 
batter stir in three eggs and a tablespoon of melted butter. 
Now beat the batter hard for three or five minutes, fill pop- 
over cups half full, or if you have not such cups, use your 
gem pans. Be sure your cups or pans are well greased before 
putting in your batter. They need not be heated. Set in a 
quick oven and bake from twenty minutes to half an hour — 
the time being varied by the size of the cakes you are baking. 
The cakes will puff up over the edges of the cups, and bake 



PUFFET 239 

a golden brown. Serve with maple syrup, or with cream and 
fruit, or merely with butter. 

POTATO PUFFS 

Boil and mash three large potatoes. Add one teaspoon of 
salt and one teaspoon of sugar. Mix together. Add one 
tablespoon of melted lard and one beaten egg. Dissolve half 
a yeast cake in nearly a teacup of lukewarm milk. Stir this 
into the potatoes, and add enough flour to make a stiff dough ; 
that is, about one cup and a half, perhaps a little more. Set 




Popover Cups 

the dough to rise at two o'clock in the afternoon if you want 
the puffs for an evening meal. When light, roll out thin. 
Cut with a large biscuit cutter. Set to rise for two hours more, 
and bake in a quick oven a very light brown. 

PUFFET 

Melt one cup of butter into one quart of warm milk. Add 
one teaspoon of salt. Beat four eggs very light. Add them 
to the milk when it cools enough to be lukewarm, and also put 
in half a teacup of homemade yeast, or one cake of com- 
pressed yeast dissolved in cold water. Have in another pan 
one pint and a half of flour. Pour the mixture into the flour, 
gradually stirring in well. Continue to add more flour till 
you have a batter that will let a spoon stand. After beating 
hard, put the dough in square greased pans. Set to rise, 
covered, in a warm place. When light, bake in square, deep 
pans 



240 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

RICE BREAKFAST CAKES 

Bring to boil one pint of milk. Set to cool, and when 
cool add two tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of butter, 
quarter of a yeast cake, a large cup of boiled flaky rice, half 
a teaspoon of salt, and flour to make a stiff batter. Set to rise 
in a place where it will be warm all night. To prepare for 
breakfast, stir the mixture vigorously and drop from a spoon 
into small hot muflin rings or gem pans, and bake in a hot oven. 

RYE DROP CAKES 

Beat the yolks and whites of five eggs till they are a fine 
froth. Then stir in a pint and a half of rye flour, adding 
with it a pinch of salt, a pinch of soda, and a pint and two 
tablespoonfuls of fresh milk. Have hot popover cups. Oil 
them well, drop in the rye batter and bake. 

RYE POPOVERS 

Sift together one cup of pastry flour, one and a half cups 
of ryemeal, one teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of sugar. 
Whip three eggs till very light, add two cups of milk and 
pour gradually into the flour, then beat till frothy. Pour into 
buttered popover cups, which ought to be hissing hot, and 
bake in a hot oven for thirty minutes. [See illustration, Plate 
XXL] 

SALLY LUNN 

Mix into one quart of flour one teaspoon of salt. Add 
one teacup of warm milk and one teacup of warm water, half 
a cup of melted butter, half a teaspoon of soda dissolved in 
cold water, and four eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Stir this to a 
smooth batter, and add four iron spoons of potato yeast. Beat 
hard after the yeast is added. Grease a tin pan with butter. 
Pour the mixture into it to rise. Set in a warm place. It 
will not be light under six hours. Bake three-quarters of an 
hour in a steady oven. When done, turn it out to send to the 
table. 



CREAM SCONES 241 

BARLEY SCONES 

Bring a pint of milk to boil in a saucepan, adding a tea- 
spoon of salt. Mix in fresh barley meal till you have a stiff 
paste. Then proceed as in making cream scones. Roll out 
the paste and cut it in cakes — these cakes are very often tri- 
angular. Bake on a greased hot griddle or in a pan in a quick 
oven. Serve hot. 

CREAM SCONES 

In a saucepan bring to boil a pint of cream. Sift in enough 
flour to make a thick batter, while sifting keeping the cream 
hot, but not boiling. Add a teaspoon of salt. Flour your 
board and put the dough upon it. Roll out till about quarter 
of an inch thick, cut in small cakes, and cook on a hot griddle, 
slightly greased, till a golden brown, turning the cakes when 
one side has browned and then browning the other side. Serve 
hot

WAFFLES 

STIR oiie pint of sour milk into one heaping pint of flour. 
Add a tablespoon of melted butter and the yolks of three 
eggs and beat well. Next put in a teaspoon of soda dissolved in 
a little warm water. Stir together rapidly and add the whites 
of the three eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Cook in greased, 
hot waffle-irons till a golden brown, and send to the table hot. 

CREAM WAFFLES 
Add two eggs beaten light to a pint of sour cream in which 
a teaspoon of soda dissolved in a tablespoon of cold water has 
been beaten. Then put in flour to make a thin batter, and 
also half a teaspoon of salt. Have your waffle-irons hot and 
well greased. Cook to a golden brown, and serve hot with 
maple syrup, sugar, butter, or honey. 

RICE WAFFLES 
Into two cups of flour stir a teaspoon of baking powder 
and a cup and a half of soft-boiled rice. Add three eggs 
beaten, half a teaspoon of salt, and wet with enough fresh 
milk to make a muffin batter. Beat the batter well, drop in 
hot greased waffle-irons, and cook a fine golden brown. 

FAT FOR FRYING GRIDDLE CAKES 
Take two pounds of beef suet, cut in large pieces, and put 
in an iron frying-pan. Stand this in a hot oven and, as the suet 



WAFFLES, GRIDDLE CAKES, TOASTS 243 

melts, with a fork take out the pieces for a moment and pour 
off the fat into a tin pan. Replace the pieces in the frying- 
pan and return to the oven for further melting. Pour off the 
fat as long as it fries out. Have care not to burn it. Stand 
the pan of fat in a cold place. Keep a cup ready with a piece 
of this pan suet in it. Have a smooth stick with a piece of 
cloth wound on one end with which to grease your griddle. 
Set the cup of suet on the stove to melt the fat before be- 




Waffle-Irons 

ginning to bake cakes ; then grease the griddle with it. This 
is superior in every way to any other fat for greasing griddles, 
and more wholesome than others. 

BREAD PANCAKES 

Break stale bread into small crumbs and soften in milk till 
you have a smooth batter. To every pint of batter stir in two 
eggs and half a teaspoon of salt. Beat firmly, and then bake 
on a griddle, browning both sides. 

BREAD BATTER CAKES 

Soak one pint and a half of coarse, stale breadcrumbs in 
one pint of milk. This can be done overnight. Mash the 
soaked bread with a potato masher until smooth. Add one 



2U THE HOME COOK BOOK 

teaspoon of salt and two beaten eggs. Stir well. Put into 
one pint of flour two heaping teaspoons of baking powder. 
Add to the breadcrumbs and stir thoroughly. Bake on a hot 
griddle, greased with beef suet which has been tried out. 
These bread cakes take a little longer to bake than ordinary 
batter cakes. If preferred, the yolks and whites can be di- 
vided. The yolks put in with the flour, and the stiffly beaten 
whites the last thing before baking. 

WHEAT BATTER CAKES 

Mix through one pint of wheat flour half a teaspoon of 
salt, one even teaspoon of baking powder, and the yolks of 
two eggs not beaten. Measure one pint of buttermilk, and 
beat into the flour enough to form a batter and to beat the 
eggs thoroughly. Then add the rest of the buttermilk, one 
teaspoon of melted butter, and three-quarters of an even tea- 
spoon of soda dissolved in cold water. Last, put in the stiffly 
beaten whites of the eggs and mix them gently through the 
batter with a fork. When baking, lay the spoon on a plate ; 
that is, do not put it in the batter, as it makes the cakes heavy. 
Grease the griddle with beef suet which has been tried out. 

NO-EGG SOUR-MILK PANCAKES 

Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of soda 
in a tablespoon of cold water and mix with a pint of sour 
milk. Then slowly stir in flour to make a batter of the right 
thickness for baking. Grease your hot griddle lightly with 
suet or a piece of salt pork, drop the cakes in even form, 
and cook till a soft brown. Serve at once on a hot plate. 

BREAKFAST DROP CAKES 

]\Iix one tablespoon of sugar with one egg and a pinch of 
salt. Add a cup of sour milk, a teaspoon of soda dissolved 
in a little water, and flour enough to make a stiff batter. Drop 
from a spoon into hot lard, fry a delicate brown, and drain 



WAFFLES, GRIDDLE CAKES, TOASTS 245 

on brown or blotting paper a moment before sending to table 
hot. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES 

Mix together one pint of buckwheat flour and three- 
quarters of a cup of graham flour. Into this put one heaping 
teaspoon of salt, half a cup of potato yeast, and one pint and a 
half of tepid water. Mix and beat very hard and smooth. 
Set to rise overnight near a fire, or in some very warm place. 
Buckwheat being a heavy flour, breakfast cakes should be 
put to rise as early as eight a'clock in the evening, and kept 
covered. For convenience, mix in a tin saucepan with a 
handle. In the morning, before baking, add a good pinch of 
soda dissolved in cold water and one tablespoon of molasses. 
Grease the griddle with suet that has been tried out. 

ST. LOUIS PERFECT CORN CAKES 

Mix into one pint and a half of cornmeal one teaspoon of 
salt. Scald it with one pint and a half of boiling water. Add 
one tablespoon of molasses and two eggs not beaten. Beat 
hard together to lighten the eggs. Add to this half a pint of but- 
termilk, one even teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water, and 
half a pint of white flour in which is mixed half a teaspoon of 
baking powder. Last, put in one dessertspoon of melted but- 
ter. Do not make the cakes too small in putting them on the 
griddle. Grease the griddle with beef suet that has been tried 
out. In stirring up the cakes, use a tin saucepan for lightness ; 
it is easier to manage. 

GREEN CORN PANCAKES 

Have sweet, tender green corn. Ciit down the middle of 
each row of kernels, and with the dull edge of the knife 
scrape out the pulp of the corn. To a pint of the scraped-out 
pulp add half a cup of milk, two eggs beaten, salt and pepper 
to taste, and flour enough to make a pancake batter. Heat 
a pancake griddle, and cook as you cook buckwheat or wheat 
cakes. 



246 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

HOE CAKES 
Put in a pan a teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of sugar, 
and with these stir a pint of yellow cornmeal freshly ground. 
Over this pour boiling water to wet it to a soft dough thick- 
ness, not a thin batter, but a soft dough. Be sure the water is 
boiling hot, and stir fast, so that the meal will absorb and 
swell. Have a hot griddle well greased. Drop from a spoon 
and gently flatten the cake till it is about half an inch thick. 
Brown it till it is a golden hue on both sides. Serve hot, and 
eat with butter, or with butter and molasses, or with cream 
and scraped maple sugar. 

RICE BATTER CAKES 

Mash one teacup of rice already boiled soft. Mix into it 
two or three beaten eggs, one even teaspoon of salt, one table- 
spoon of melted butter, two teacups of flour, in which two 
heaping teaspoons of baking powder have been mixed. Stir 
well together, and add one pint of milk. Bake on a hot grid- 
dle greased with beef suet which has been tried out. Mix 
the cakes in a tin saucepan with a handle for convenience. 

RICE PANCAKES 

Wash and boil a cup of rice till the kernels are perfectly 
tender. If water remains with the rice, drain it ofif, for the 
rice should be dry. Into a cup of flour sift a heaping tea- 
spoon of baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt. Stir the 
flour gradually into one pint of milk, add three eggs well 
beaten, and last of all, the cooked rice. Beat well together, and 
bake on a hot greased griddle. Put the batter on with a large 
spoon, and since the rice prevents a ready spreading of the 
batter, help it lightly with the spoon. Brown on both sides. 

CRACKER PANADA 
Toast to a golden brown four or five crackers, pour over 
them boiling water enough to soak them ; pour oil the water, 
sprinkle with sugar and dust with nutmeg. 



WAFFLES, GRIDDLE CAKES, TOASTS 247 

TOAST 

Have either white, graham or other breads a day old. Cut 
slices half an inch thick, and lay in a pan in the oven till the 
bread is crisp and dry, not dried hard and inedible, however. 
When dry and crisp, brown it to golden tint over or before 
fire and on both sides. Send to the table hot, where the eater 
butters it as he eats it. 

CREAMED TOAST 

Toast eight slices of bread as directed under "Toast." 
Heat a quart of milk in a double-boiler and thicken till it is a 
creamy thickness by stirring and cooking in three tablespoons 
of flour wetted with half a cup of cold milk. Add half a 
teaspoon of salt. Butter the toast and lay a slice in a deep 
dish. Over it ladle the hot creamy milk. Lay in another slice 
and spread that with the milk. So proceed, keeping your toast 
in a pile, and pouring over the remainder of the milk when 
you have used up the toast. Serve at once. Graham bread 
is better than white for this toast. 

FRENCH TOAST 

Beat together two eggs, add half a cup of milk and half a 
teaspoon of salt. Dip slices of bread in this mixture till both 
sides are covered. Brown in hot fat, or lay upon a greased 
griddle and toast till a golden brown. Serve hot and at once. 

MILK TOAST 

Put one pint of milk in a saucepan. Set it in another con- 
taining hot water. Salt the milk enough to taste slightly salt. 
Dissolve one even teaspoon of flour in a little cold water and 
stir it through the milk while cold. Stir the milk while heat- 
ing, to prevent the flour lumping. When it comes to boil, set 
back, still standing in the water to keep hot, cut ofif the crust, 
and brown six slices of stale bread from a baker's small loaf. 
Lay in a vegetable dish. Melt one tablespoon and a half of 



248 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

butter in the hot milk. Pour the milk over the toast, which 
should be cold before the milk is added. Serve at once. 

MOLASSES TOAST FOR CHILDREN 

Toast the bread as directed under "Toast." Butter a 
slice, lay it in a shallow bowl, and pour over it molasses pre- 
pared in the following manner: Take a small cup of pure 
molasses, not that heavy with glucose, but pure West India 
molasses, and mix with it the same quantity of boiling water 
and a teaspoon of ginger. Pour over the hot toast, let stand 
in a warm place for a moment and eat while warm. 

WATER TOAST 

Having browned slices of bread according to foregoing 
directions, have ready a hot plate and a pan holding salted 
boiling water an inch deep. Take the slices of toast singly, 
submerge each, holding with a knife and fork in the salted 
boiling water for a second. Lay on the hot plate, and butter. 
A pile of four or five slices may be made, on a large plate, 
and should be served as soon as buttered.

FOOD VALUE 

DURING cold weather, when the body requires all the 
warmth possible to be obtained from heat-giving foods, 
one important addition to the day's menu is a perfectly cooked 
breakfast cereal. Two of the best foods for this purpose are 
oatmeal and cornmeal, which are richer in fats than the other 
grains. Oatmeal is the richer of the two in food material, 
but plenty of exercise is required for its perfect digestion. For 
the strong, hardworking laborer it is one of the best and most 
economical of foods. For people who lead sedentary lives, 
the lighter wheat foods, of which there is an abundance in the 
market, are better suited. 

NEED OF VARIETY 

The housekeeper who studies the family health ought to 
familiarize herself thoroughly with the subject of breakfast 
cereals ; it is one of large importance. Having found what 
foods are best liked by the household, she might lay in for 
the winter's needs a good assortment and use the cereals 
alternately; a wheat preparation one morning, oatmeal an- 
other, and cornmeal the next morning perhaps. There will 
be no palling on the appetite with such a routine, besides the 
cereals may be served in a varied style day by day. Baked 
apples are a delicious accompaniment to any of the oatmeal 
or wheat cereals, as are also sliced peaches, well-ripened 



260 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

bananas, dates, or flavored apple sauce. [See illustration, 
Plate XXL] Serve with cream. Never spoil a good cereal 
by serving poor milk with it. Cereals are deficient in the fats 
contained in cream and in the salt found in fruits, therefore 
the combination, which is as delicious as it is healthful. A 
preparation like farina is much improved by having stirred 
into it, just before serving, figs, dates, or cooked prunes, cut 
in pieces. 

HOW TO KEEP CEREALS 

When cereals arrive, empty them at once into glass jars, 
and screw the lids on tight. Frequently the manufacturer 
or the grocer is blamed for a poor, wormy cereal, which has 
really been ruined by the treatment accorded it on the pantry 
shelves. It is left in the paper case in which it was packed, 
with the cover torn off. Mice regale on it, moths inhabit it, 
dust settles on it, damp induces mould, and presently it is 
spoiled. The manufacturer seals it with care, the grocer 
stores it on dry, clean shelves. Then comes the housewife 
who thinks any sort of treatment is good enough for groceries. 

NEED OF THOROUGH COOKING 

Cereals are infrequently accorded the right of proper 
cooking. An indigestible pasty-looking mess meets with the 
most unfavorable verdict, when, if cooked as it ought to be, 
nothing could be more nutritious or appetizing. The direc- 
tions which accompany a cereal seldom give time enough for 
cooking, unless it be set to boil in a vessel right over the fire, 
which is far from satisfactory. Steaming for hours in a 
double-boiler gives very different results. The method for 
cooking cereals is the same, although measurements differ, 
one cup of cereal absorbing more or less liquid than an- 
other.

need for thorough cooking, I have compiled the following

THE WAY TO COOK A CEREAL 

To cook any of these cereals, set the upper half of a double- 
boiler over the fire and bring the water to boil. Add one 
teaspoon of salt for one quart of water. For any coarse- 
grained cereal, the Scotch method of adding the meal — 
"mirlin' it in," as it is called — can scarcely be improved upon. 
Measure the oatmeal into a bowl, hold it in the left hand, and 
slowly with the right hand sprinkle it into briskly boiling 
water. Until every grain of the meal separates stir con- 
stantly. In five minutes the cereal will have begun to thicken 
slightly. Now set the upper half in the lower part of the 
double-boiler half filled with hot water. Put on the lid and 
allow the cereal to steam till the grains are perfectly swollen. 
Do no stirring after the steaming process begins, or the cereal 
will be starchy, the grains broken and the fine nutty flavor 
destroyed. In cooking a small-grained cereal, such as farina, 
wet it with cold water, add to the boiling water, tben cook 
like the oatmeal except that it may be stirred occasionally. 



252 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Indeed, before it is fully cooked a brisk beating with a wire 
whisk will improve it, breaking any lumps which may have 
formed. 

A SECRET 

One secret of making a cereal as delicious as possible lies 
in proper measurements of the grain and the water. Always 
use the same cup for measuring, and follow directions ex- 
actly. Adding water to thin a cereal when it is half cooked 
or pouring it off to thicken it will ruin the flavor completely. 
When a cereal has cooked the required time and is still too 
moist, it may be thickened in ten minutes by taking off the 
lid of the boiler and allowing evaporation to thicken it. The 
flavor of many cereals is much improved by using half water 
and half milk in the cooking. Any one who has tasted the 
milk porridge of Scotland will realize this. When the milk 
is used the cereal must be very carefully cooked ; it will 
burn readily if set over the fire. Hominy, farina, and oat- 
meal are especially improved by the addition of milk. 

Cracked wheat is delicious eaten cold. It thickens con- 
siderably while cooling, therefore add one-third more water 
than if it is to be served hot. Pour it in a wet mold and allow 
it to jelly. Serve with cream, sugar, and raw or stewed 
fruit. Hominy may be used as a vegetable as well as for a 
foundation for various delicious puddings. This cereal re- 
quires somewhat different treatment from wheat or oatmeal 
preparations. Soak the hominy for several hours in cold 
water, strain and put it in salted boiling water. Cook for 
three or four hours. If used as an accompaniment to meat, 
instead of potatoes, as it is commonly served in the South, 
drain away when cooked all superfluous moisture, add a table- 
spoon of butter and a dash of pepper. Send to the table in a 
hot vegetable dish. Farina, Ralston food, cream of wheat, 
or any of the finely ground wheat preparations make de- 
licious puddings cooked in milk. Add a dash of salt, steam 
till tender, pour into a wet mold and chill. Serve with sweet- 
ened cream or a boiled custard, and any fruit that is in season. 



CEREALS 253 

ANOTHER WAY TO COOK OATMEAL 

Put into a double-boiler one quart of boiling water, one 
heaping teaspoon of salt, and one even teacup of oatmeal. Stir 
well, and as it thickens stir again, and every little while until 
done. Cook two hours and a half, and when done, turn it 
out into a bowl or crock, and cover at once. When required 
for use, take out the quantity needed, and as it will be rather 
stiff, add a quarter of a cup of warm water. Place this in a 
granite saucepan, cover, and set this saucepan in another, in 
which put hot water. Stir well until softened, and keep water 
in the lower pan. Serve very hot. 

ANOTHER WAY TO COOK CRACKED WHEAT 

Put into a double-boiler one quart of boiling water, one 
even teacup of cracked wheat, one teaspoon of salt. Have 
water boiling in the lower boiler. Stir at intervals, and boil 
four hours. Pour out into a crock and cover. When wanted for 
use, put the quantity needed in a granite pot, add water if re- 
quired to soften it, set this saucepan in another, in which have 
boiling water, cover and heat, breaking up carefully with a 
spoon. Eat with cream. 

CORNMEAL MUSH 

Put one quart of boiling water into a double-boiler, add one 
heaping teaspoon of salt and one pint and a half of commeal. 
Mix the meal with cold water, soft enough to pour into the 
boiling water. Stir well with a wooden spoon, and stir often. 
As it thickens, continue to stir every little while until it is 
done. Boil two hours, and keep plenty of hot water in the 
lower pan. 

FRIED CORNMEAL MUSH 

After the mush is boiled, heat water in a two-quart tin 
pan, pour the mush in while hot, and cover it with a plate 
to prevent a scum forming on the top. When perfectly hard 
and cold, turn it out on a plate, and cut into slices half an 



254 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

inch thick. Turn the sHces over and over in a plate of corn- 
meal, and fry in enough lard to keep from sticking to the pan, 
and no more. Cover while frying, and fry a nice light brown. 
Serve very hot, and with maple syrup, if sweet is wished. 

RYEMEAL PORRIDGE 

Put a teaspoon of salt in a quart of water and bring it to 
boil. Then stir in little by little, so that it will not lump, a half- 
pint of ryemeal. Cook gently for an hour either in a double- 
boiler or on the stove, but off the direct heat of the fire.

FREEZING 

Patented freezers sometimes carry with them directions 
for their use. 

In breaking the ice for freezing, a duck or canvas bag and 
hammer or mallet should be used. Or the ice may be chopped 
or shaved. When the ice is in small pieces, pack it in the 
pail or tub about the can which holds the mixture to be 




Ice Shaver 

frozen, putting in alternate layers of ice and rock salt. The 
proportions of ice and salt depend a little upon what you are 
going to freeze and the quality of the ice — commonly the less 
salt the slower the freezing. Ice cream takes a shorter time 
than water ices. But you want ice cream smooth, while fruit 
and water ices are granulated. Therefore, since the slower the 
freezing the smoother, the best general rule for proportion is 
one-third of rock salt to two-thirds of ice. Of different kinds 
of ices, the wet, porous snow ice is best, because its dampness 



256 



THE HOME COOK BOOK 



and porous quality allow an easy union with the salt. Ice 
cream is smoother if stirred during the first part of its freez- 
ing, allowing an hour and a half to two hours for the whole 
process. 

Guard against any salt getting into the can. Until the 
stirring is over, pack the ice to within an inch of the top of the 
freezer. After the stirring, tie a firm band of cloth about 
the rim of the can and cover the top with ice and salt, to corn- 




ice Cream Freezer 



plete the freezing. While this is finishing, lay a piece of 
blanket or carpet over the freezer. 

In packing a mixture to keep it frozen, or to chill thor- 
oughly, use less salt than the proportion named above. 



FREEZING WITHOUT A FREEZER 

If one is without a freezer, cream or sherbet may be frozen 
in a tin pail covered and set in a larger pail or tub packed 
with three parts of cracked ice and one part rock salt. The 
cream in the pail should be scraped from the sides toward the 
middle and beaten together during the first of the freezing. 
The pail should also be turned round from side to side several 
times at intervals. 



FROZEN SWEETS 257 

SALT IN FREEZER 

Do not throw away the salt which remains in the freezer 
after ice cream has been made. The salt will do for the next 
freezing. If it is slushy and wet, use it for top layer in the 
next freezing, and thus hasten the chilling. 

BAG FOR POUNDING ICE 

White duck makes a good bag. Cut it about fourteen 
inches long ; one width of duck, one yard wide, will make two 
bags. Stitch the bag together with a sewing machine. Make 
a hem on the top one inch wide. Cut a strip of the duck two 
inches wide. Double and stitch it together. This is for the 
handle. Fasten it tight on either side of the bag, in the centre. 

TO MAKE MERINGUE SHELLS 

Beat the white of an egg with a knife to a stiiif froth. Add 
little by little a teacup of granulated sugar. Lay a clean, strong 
paper on an inverted dripping pan, and on the paper drop the 
meringue with a large spoon. Set the pan in the top of the 
oven and leave the door open. In half or three-quarters of an 
hour the shells will dry out. These meringue shells are filled 
with ice cream and served one on a plate to each guest. 

ICE CREAM 

Dissolve thoroughly quarter of a box of gelatine in a little 
water. To it dissolved, put two quarts of cream, the beaten 
whites of two eggs, a cup and three-fourths of sugar, and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Flavor with what is to your taste, 
and freeze. 

SIMPLE ICE CREAMS FOR CHILDREN 

A simple way to make ice cream for children is to mix a cup 
of sugar, a pinch of salt, and two and a half tablespoons of 
flour, and pour over the mixture a pint of hot milk. Set the 
whole in a double-boiler and cook a full quarter of an hour, 



258 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

at the end adding a beaten egg, a cup of cream, and a pint 
of milk with whatever flavoring you choose. 

If vanilla, add a full tablespoon and a half. 

If strawberry or raspberry, crush a box of berries, sprinkle 
with sugar till quite sweet, stand long enough to draw out some 
of the juice, and then add to the cream before freezing. 

If peach, peel and stone a large quart of peaches, sugar 
well, crush and add to the cream before freezing. 

If banana, skin three or four bananas, crush, add a sprinkle 
of sugar and the juice of half a lemon, and put in the cream 
before freezing. 

If chocolate, add scraped chocolate to the boiling plain 
ice cream till you have the quantity suited to your taste. In 
the event of adding unsweetened chocolate, extra sugar should 
be put in. 

BURNED ALMOND ICE CREAM 

Sweeten to your taste a custard of four eggs and a pint of 
milk. Take half a pound of blanched almonds and brown them 
in a saucepan with six tablespoons of sugar. Pound to a 
paste and add little by little a quart of cream. Mix with the 
custard and put in the freezer. After it is frozen pack it in 
a mold or serve without molding. 

ALMOND AND RAISIN FROZEN PUDDING 

Boil one cup of sugar in a cup of water till the sugar 
begins to thread. Move where it will merely simmer, and stir 
in gradually the yolks of four eggs which have been beaten. 
Let boil till quite thick. Take from the fire and beat till cool. 
Then add a tablespoon of gelatine soaked in two tablespoons 
of water and beat till thick. Stir in a pint of boiled cream, a 
cup of ground almonds, half a cup of seeded raisins, pack in 
a freezer and freeze. Instead of raisins candied orange peel 
may be used, or preserved pineapple. This pudding may be 
served plain, or with a sauce of whipped cream flavored to 
the taste.

WHEN the warm days of spring come the sweets we eat 
should be delicate and light. Such sweet dishes lessen 
the housemother's labors if she will but make them from fresh 
growths. We greet the spring acids with delight — our sys- 
tems crave them — and in early spring and summer we have 
rhubarb, pineapples, gooseberries, strawberries, cherries, cur- 
rants, and other delicious new growths. 

ANGEL FOOD PUDDING 

Use a cake of medium-size of angel food. Cut it through in 
an upper and under half. For a filling to spread upon these 
halves — as you spread strawberries on a shortcake — whip stiff 
one pint of cream. Into it stir half a cup of chopped and 
seeded raisins, half a cup of almonds and walnut meats 
mixed, half a cup of soft candies or marshmallows, or any 
candied fruits you may have in small bits. Flavor with wine, 
or brandy, or vanilla. Spread the cream and fruit over the 
lower half of the cake, lay on the upper half with the crust 
side down, spread this also with the cream and fruit, and serve. 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 265 

APPLE BETTY 

Break up small pieces of stale bread with its crust. Put 
into the bottom of a pudding dish nice-flavored, sliced apples. 
Over this strew a good deal of sugar, several lumps of butter, 
and sprinkle well with ground cinnamon. Next a layer of 
apples, again sugar, butter, and ground cinnamon. Then an- 
other layer of the broken bread, more sugar, butter, and cin- 
namon. Fill the dish in this manner, and have the bread the 
top layer, and on it also put butter, sugar, and cinnamon. 
Pour cold water down the side of the dish until it comes al- 
most to the top. To succeed this must be made rich with but- 
ter, and very sweet, and baked thoroughly. Set into a mod- 
erately hot oven, with a pan of warm water above it in the 
upper oven to prevent the bread burning, and bake a light 
brown and until the apples are very soft. When done, serve 
with rich cream. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS 

Peel and core nice flavored apples. Take out the core with 
a corer. Make the dough the same as for baking-powder 
biscuit, using more or less milk as the flour may need to roll 
out nicely. Lay the dough on a pastry board, and roll out 
each dumpling the size of a small saucer. Lay one apple in 
each piece of dough, and sugar where the core has been taken 
out. Carefully fold the dough over the apple. To steam 
dumplings put a perforated pie-plate upside down in the 
steamer, and on this set a thin plate with the dumplings on it. 
Set the steamer over a pot of boiling water, and have ready 
a double piece of muslin a little larger than the top of the 
steamer. Cover it first with this and then with the lid, on top 
of which lay a heavy weight to keep it closely covered. Steam 
forty minutes. If you prefer to boil the dumplings, grease a 
cloth with a little lard, and sprinkle flour over it, then put the 
dumpling in and tie it. Drop into a pot of boiling water and 
boil half an hour. Serve hot with hard sauce, or simply open

2G6 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the dumpling and lay a piece of butter on to it, and add rich 
cream. To my taste this latter sauce is the best. 

FRIED APPLES 

A JEWISH DISH 

Peel and cut in halves five tart apples. Dip the halves 
in a beaten egg, then in powdered sugar, and fry in hot butter 
in a saucepan. When done lift out, strew with sugar, and 
serve. 

APPLE WITH MERINGUE 

Cook a tart, juicy apple till soft. Put through a colander, 
sweeten and flavor to taste ; then fold in lightly the white of 
an egg beaten dry. Heap the mixture in a pretty dish. 

APPLE AND SAGO PUDDING 

Wash half a pint of sago, cover with a pint and a half of 
cold water, soak an hour, and then cook in a double-boiler till 
the sago is clear and transparent. Have peeled and cored half 
a dozen tart apples of the sort which easily cook soft. Put 
them in a baking dish, pour the sago over and round them, 
cover, and bake till the apples are tender. Serve with sugar 
and cream. 

APPLE SNOW 

Pare and quarter six finely flavored tart apples. Cover 
with cold water and sweeten just enough to be slightly acid. 
Cook slowly until rich and clear, pressing out all the lumps. 
Beat the whites of two eggs to a stifif froth. Put the apple 
in the dish in which it is to be served. Turn the whites 
lightly through the hot apple with a silver fork. Stand in a 
cold place, and serve with cream. 

BANANA SHORTCAKE 

Make a good biscuit crust, according to the directions 
under "Strawberry Shortcake." Then proceed as in short- 
cake making. Split open and butter the crust while hot — 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 267 

buttering on the cut side. Peel three or four well-ripened 
bananas. Shred the bananas till they are finely broken. 
Spread thick on the buttered crust, sprinkle lightly with salt 
and add sugar if the taste directs. Then lay on the second 
buttered crust and another thick layer of bananas, which 
again salt and sugar to taste. The juice of an orange may be 
added also if the taste directs. Serve the shortcake with 
cream, or with a plain boiled custard. 

BANANA SOUFFLfi 

Peel first, then mash with a wooden punch stick or with a 
silver fork three ripe bananas. Add three tablespoons of 
sugar and afterward the whites of three eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth. Put in a buttered baking dish and set in a well- 
heated oven for ten to fifteen minutes. Serve hot with cream 
as a sauce. 

Other fruits, such as peaches, soft apples, prunes, dates, 
etc., may be used instead of bananas for such a souffle. But 
fruits with a fibre, tough skin, or any harsh ingredient should 
be put through a sieve before adding the sugar and beaten 
whites. 

BARLEY JELLY 

A JEWISH RECEIPT 

Put a cup of pearl barley in a quart of cold water and 
bring to boil. Pour oflf the water, add another quart, and 
simmer gently over a slow fire for three hours, stirring fre- 
quently. Strain, sweeten to taste with white sugar and the 
juice of a lemon; add quarter of an ounce of isinglass dis- 
solved in a little water, and pour into a mold. 

BAVARL\N CREAM 

Scald two cups of thin cream, and pour it slowly over 
one tablespoon of granulated gelatine, which has been dis- 
solved in half a cup of cold water. Add the slightly beaten 
yolks of two eggs. Put in a double-boiler and cook till the 
mixture coats the spoon. Put through a strainer. When 



268 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

cold add one cup of whipped cream, the whites of the two 
eggs beaten very stiff, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Pour 
into a mold and leave on ice for three hours. Serve with a 
boiled custard or with whipped cream. This cream may be 
flavored with coffee, chocolate, or fruit juice. You may add 
to it chopped nuts, mashed bananas, macaroons, strawberries, 
or candied cherries. 

BOILED BLACKBERRY PUDDING 

Mix through one quart of flour one teaspoon of cream of 
tartar and one teaspoon of salt, three beaten eggs, one pint 
of milk, and one teacup of sugar. Add half a teaspoon of 
soda dissolved in cold water and two quarts of blackberries. 
Mix all together. Add more flour to make the batter stiff 
enough for a spoon to stand up in it, as the berries will thin 
the batter. Grease a pudding cloth (a square piece of un- 
bleached muslin is best) lightly with lard. Sprinkle flour 
over it. Lay the cloth over a colander and pour in the pud- 
ding. Tie it, leaving a little room for the pudding to swell. 
Put in a pot of boiling water. Fasten the ends of the pud- 
ding cloth with the cover of the pot. Set a weight or a 
flatiron on it. Keep the pudding covered with water and 
boil hard without stopping for two hours. When done, turn 
it out on a large plate, and serve with hard sauce. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE 

Upon the bottom of a mold lay a sheet of white paper and 
about the sides range lady-fingers close together. To make

the filling, dissolve two teaspoons of gelatine in quarter of 
a cup of cold water. Add a pint of hot milk and three- 
quarters of a cup of sugar. As it cools stir in a teaspoon 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 269 

of vanilla, a pint of cream whipped to a froth, and lastly the 
beaten whites of two eggs. Pour into the mold and set in the 
ice-box for an hour or two while it stiffens. Serve by tipping 
the mold upside down, slipping out the contents, and deco- 
rating the top of the charlotte with powdered lady-fingers, a 
puff of cream, candy, or candied fruit. 

COFFEE CHARLOTTE RUSSE 
Line a mold with lady-fingers. Whip two cups of cream 
and set in the ice-box to chill. In a quarter of a cup of cold 
black coffee soften a tablespoon of gelatine. In a double- 
boiler heat three-fourths of a cup of milk and three-fourths 
of a cup of sugar. Stir in two beaten eggs and the gelatine 
dissolved in the black coffee. Beat, strain, and cool. When 
it begins to stiffen fold in the cold whipped cream, and pour 
into the mold lined with lady-fingers. Set away to stiffen. 
In serving, invert the mold and have your charlotte standing 
on a low dish. 

ROSE CHARLOTTE 
Soften an ounce of gelatine in cold water. Boil slowly 
until dissolved in one pint of sweetened cream. Beat four 
eggs light. Add to the jelly mixture, stir well, take from 
fire, flavor with rose extract and pour over slices of sponge- 
cake. When cold cover with pink frosting. [See illustration, 
Plate XXIL] 

CHERRY TAPIOCA 
Soak a cup of tapioca overnight. Next morning simmer 
in a saucepan with one pint of boiling water and a pinch of 
salt till the tapioca is clear. Add a pound and a half of 
cooked cherries without their pits, a cup of sugar and half a 
teaspoon of salt. Bring to boil, and then set away to cool. 
Serve cold with sugar. 

CHESTNUT CROQUETTES 
Boil one quart of chestnuts. Shell, remove brown skin and 
pound fine. To each two cups of chestnut meats allow two 



270 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

beaten yolks, one and one-half tablespoons of butter, half a 
teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and half a teaspoon of salt. Form 
'into croquettes ; egg and crumb, and fry in deep fat. Garnish 
with chestnuts glazed with caramel. [See illustration, Plate 
XXIII.] 

CHOCOLATE BLANC-MANGE 
Melt three tablespoons of chocolate in a double-boiler. 
Add a pint of fresh milk and half a cup of sugar. Stir smooth 
three tablespoons of cornstarch in half a cup of cold milk, 
and slowly pour into the hot milk in the double-boiler. When 
the cornstarch thickens the milk and is smooth, flavor with 
a teaspoon of vanilla and pour into small individual molds, 
first wetting them with cold water, or into one large mold 
and cool. Serve with cream and sugar. 

CHOCOLATE CUSTARD 
Melt in a double-boiler with half a cup of milk two table- 
spoons of grated chocolate. When the chocolate is smoothed 
in the milk, add a cup and a half of milk and let all heat. 
Beat two eggs with half a cup of sugar. Pour the hot milk 
and chocolate over the eggs and sugar, put back in the double- 
boiler and cook till the custard thickens. Add a teaspoon of 
vanilla, pour in the dish in which you wish to serve it and set 
away to cool. / 

CHOCOLATE PUDDING 
Put in a double-boiler a large pint of milk and add three 
tablespoons of grated chocolate. Heat and then add two 
tablespoons of cornstarch which you have blended with a 
little cold milk. Have ready a dish for baking puddings. 
Take the milk mixture from the fire, stir in the yolks of four 
eggs beaten into a cup of sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla, and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Pour all in the baking dish, set in a 
pan of hot water and then in the oven. Bake until the eggs 
are set and the pudding stifif. Beat stifif the whites of the 
four eggs, add a cup of sugar and a little vanilla, spread over 
the top of the pudding and brown in a moderate oven. 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 271 

CORNSTARCH PUDDING 

Salt to taste a quart of milk. Add three well beaten eggs. 
Dissolve in some of the milk three tablespoons of cornstarch, 
stirring it smooth. Put the milk in a saucepan, stir con- 
stantly, and when near boiling add the dissolved cornstarch. 
Stir hard, and boil four minutes. Wet a quart pan or tea- 
cups with cold water, pour the pudding in to harden. When 
perfectly cold turn it out, and serve with a cold boiled custard 
flavored with vanilla for a sauce. 

CORNSTARCH BLANC-MANGE WITH FRUIT 

Put a quart of milk in a double-boiler and heat, keeping 
one-half a cup from the quart. Take half a cup of sugar, 
four tablespoons (or quarter of a cup) of cornstarch, a pinch 
of salt and wet with the half a cup of milk you reserved. 
When the milk in the double-boiler boils, stir in the sugar 
mixture and stir till all is cooked smooth and the cornstarch 
thickens the milk. Beat to a froth the whites of two eggs, 
and as you take from the fire stir them in the blanc-mange. 
Set to become a little cool. In the serving dish put a layer of 
preserved fruit. Pour the cooled blanc-mange over. Set 
away to chill, and serve with cream. 

CREAM PUFFS 

Melt half a teacup of butter in a teacup of boiling water 
with a pinch of salt. When thoroughly melted and boiling, 
pour it gradually over one rounded cup of flour, stirring 
rapidly until smoothly mixed. When cool add four beaten 
eggs. Beat smooth till free from lumps. Drop a tablespoon 
of the batter on buttered tins and bake from thirty to forty 
minutes in a moderate oven. Put the pufifs close together, 
so they will not spread out. 

CREAM FOR THE PUFFS 

For the cream mix together one teacup of cream and 
half a teacup of boiling water. When boiling stir in half a 



272 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

teacup of sugar. Beat three eggs into one tablespoon of 
flour. Pour the boihng cream and sugar gradually over the 
eggs, stirring hard. This done, set the saucepan in another 
of hot water, stir constantly and let the cream gradually 
thicken rather thick. Flavor it with vanilla extract. 

When the puffs are cool cut each puff near the top with a 
sharp knife, and cut enough to admit a teaspoon. With a 
spoon put the cream in each puff. 

CURRANT SHORTCAKE 

Sift one teaspoon of salt, three teaspoons of baking 
powder and one quart of flour; then rub into it four table- 
spoons of butter. Add enough sweet milk to work into a soft 
dough. Divide into two parts, and pat out so as to fit two 
oblong pans and bake in hot oven. When done, split and 
spread with butter. Have ready one quart of currants stripped 
from stems. Put in a bowl and add one pint of sugar and 
crush. Spread between the layers of the shortcake. Sift 
pulverized sugar over the top and arrange stems of red 
and white currants on top and stemmed currants about 
the base. 

One seldom sees currants served except when converted 
into jam, but a currant shortcake is as delicious as the famous 
and favored strawberry. When stripped from the stem and 
heaped in a crystal glass and served accompanied with pul- 
verized sugar, they make one of the most appetizing fruit 
dishes to serve for breakfast. [See illustration, Plate XXHL] 

BAKED CUSTARD 

Stir into a quart of milk four heaping tablespoons of 
sugar. Put in a saucepan and let come to boil. When cooled, 
pour over six well-beaten eggs, stirring constantly. Pour 
the mixture into a deep earthenware bowl, and grate nut- 
meg thickly over the top. Set the bowl in a pan of warm 
water. Put in a moderate oven. Set a pan of warm water 
in the upper oven above it, and bake until a thin knife thrust 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 273 

into the custard will come out without the custard sticking 
to it. 

In making puddings or custards, boiling the milk before 
adding other ingredients will prevent the dish being watery. 
While nutmeg is valuable as a flavoring, it is not generally 
known that it is also an opiate, and in large quantities 
poisonous. 

BOILED CUSTARD 

Beat very light five or six eggs with one teaspoon of corn- 
starch. Mix this into one quart of milk, keeping out two 
whites. Sweeten with four tablespoons of sugar. Pour into 
a granite or porcelain-lined saucepan. Set the saucepan in 
another holding warm water. Let the water gradually come 
to boil, and boil slowly. Stir constantly to prevent the egg 
from curdling. When creamy thick, take from the fire and 
flavor with extract of vanilla or lemon. Beat the whites of 
the two eggs to a stiff froth. Turn them over lightly in the 
hot custard with a silver fork. Prepare this in the dish it 
is to be served in. If boiled custard is required for a sauce, 
leave in the whites, and use two eggs to a pint of milk. 

CUSTARD TART 

Peel, core, and boil in an earthenware dish, using as little 
water as possible, seven or eight large tart apples of the kind 
that cook soft. When the apples are tender, put them through 
a colander or sieve and add a small cup of granulated sugar. 
Add also the grated rind of a lemon, if you wish, or half a 
nutmeg. 

Make a custard of four eggs, reserving the whites of two, 
a quart of milk and a teacup of sugar. Heat the milk and 
sugar together in a double-boiler, add a teaspoon of salt, and 
then the eggs, stir till the custard thickens, and then remove 
it to cool. When it is cold pour over the apples. 

The whites of the two eggs whip to a froth, add a couple 
of tablespoons of sugar, and spread over the custard. 



274 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

FARINA PUDDING WITH SAUCE 

Beat the yolks of three eggs till thick and lemon-colored. 
Add gradually half a cup of sugar, a third of a cup of soft 
breadcrumbs, and a scant half cup of farina. Fold in the 
whites of three eggs beaten stiff and half a cup of nut meat 
broken in pieces. Bake in three-layer cake tins in a slow 
oven for half an hour and put together with this creamy 
sauce. Cream a fourth of a cup of butter, add gradually 
half a cup of powdered sugar, two tablespoons of milk, drop 
by drop, and one tablespoon of brandy, or a teaspoon of 
vanilla. 

FRUIT GLACfi 

First be sure your fruit is ripe and perfect, without spot 
or blemish. Wipe it carefully. Boil in a porcelain kettle a 
pound of sugar with half a teacup of water until the syrup 
is covered with large bubbles. At this juncture add an even 
tablespoon of clear white vinegar. When the sugar has 
boiled to the point of snapping in cold water take it from the 
fire. Quickly dip in the fruit, and then lay on a dish rubbed 
with a little olive oil. Clusters of grapes may be so glaced, 
and then rolled in coarse granulated sugar. Quarters of 
oranges and lemons also are treated the same way. Be sure 
the skin of the fruit is not broken. 

FRUIT IN JELLY 

Soak half a box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Add a pint of boiling water, 
one large orange and one banana peeled and sliced, a pint of 
chopped English walnut meats, half a teaspoon of salt, and 
sugar to your taste. Pour in a mold and set where it will 
cool and stiffen. Tip from the mold, and serve with cream 
and sugar. 

EARLY SUMMER FRUIT PUDDING 
This pudding is made with currants, cherries, blackberries, 
or gooseberries. Soak in a quart of milk on the back of the 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 275 

stove one pint of breadcrumbs. Add a pinch of salt, a cup 
of sugar, and beat in three eggs. If your taste likes it, add 
also such flavoring as nutmeg, or the yellow of a small lemon. 
Have ready fruit you are going to use. In a pudding boiler or 
mold put a layer of the breadcrumb batter. Then a layer of the 
fruit. Alternate these layers till you use up the batter. 
Cover the pudding boiler tight and plunge into hot water, or 
steam. Allow two hours and a half for the pudding to cook, 
and serve with hard or liquid sauce. 

GELATINE PUDDING 

Separate the whites and yolks of four eggs. Make a 
boiled custard of the yolks and a pint of milk by bringing the 
milk to boil in a double-boiler and stirring in the yolks and 
sweetening to taste. Set the custard to cool. Have one-third 
of a box of gelatine soaked a few minutes in a little cold 
water. Pour over and dissolve it with three-fourths of a 
cup of boiling water. When the custard has cooled add 
the gelatine and the beaten whites of the eggs. Stir all to- 
gether, flavor, and put in a mold to chill. 

GOOSEBERRY BETTY 

Have stewed or canned gooseberries. Cut slices of bread, 
and toast a light brown. Dip some of the slices in fresh milk 
and spread with butter. Then lay them in a pudding dish 
and cover with the stewed or canned berries which have been 
sweetened to your taste. Put in another layer of the toast, 
and again another layer of the fruit. So continue with 
alternate layers till the dish is full. Cover tight and cook in 
a moderate oven half an hour. Serve with whatever pudding 
sauce your taste directs, or with whipped cream. 

GOOSEBERRY FOOL 

Top and stalk a quart of green gooseberries and stew 
them with a little water in an earthen dish till they are 
tender. Mash them through a sieve or colander and make the 



276 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

jam very sweet with either brown or white sugar. Have 
ready in a large bowl a quart of cold boiled custard. When 
the jam is cold mix it thoroughly with the custard and serve 
cold. 

HUCKLEBERRY SHORTCAKE 

Mix together one cup of sugar and quarter of a cup of 
butter. Beat two eggs and stir them with the sugar, adding 
a cup of milk, and afterward gradually three cups of flour 
into which two teaspoons of baking powder have been 
sifted. Reserve a tablespoon of flour for dredging the cup 
of huckleberries, which you stir in last. Have square tins but- 
tered or oiled, and bake the shortcake in these about half an 
hour. The cake should be little more than an inch thick when 
done. Cut in squares, split and eat with butter or thick 
cream. 

IRISH MOSS BLANC-MANGE 
Wash and clean a heaping tablespoon of Irish moss, drop 
it in a cup of hot milk in a double-boiler and let it simmer 
till it thickens when dropped on a plate. Salt and flavor to 
taste, and put through a strainer into molds. This will make 
portions for two. Serve with cream and sugar. 

JUNKET 

In a couple of tablespoons of cold water dissolve a junket 
tablet, or use a little liquid rennet. In a double-boiler heat 
a quart of milk lukewarm, stir in the dissolved tablet, pour 
into the dish in which the junket is to be served, dust it with 
nutmeg, cover and let stand where it is Avarm till the milk 
"sets." Then cool, and serve with cream and sugar. 

LEMONS CREAMED 

From two good-sized lemons grate the rind and squeeze 
the juice. To this juice and yellow rind add two cups of 
sugar and two beaten eggs. Beat up two tablespoons of flour 
with a little cold water and add to it a cup of boiling water, 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 277 

stirring all the time. Turn this upon the sugar, eggs, and 
juice mixture, and then simmer over a fire till smooth, the 
flour being thoroughly cooked. Set to cool, and when luke- 
warm add a cup of cream which has been whipped. Chill 
and serve cold in a glass dish. 

LEMON JELLY 
Dissolve half a box of gelatine in cold water. Add one 
pint of boiling water, the juice of two lemons, two cups of 
sugar, and strain. Make the day before using, and set away 
to harden. 

CHILLED ORANGES 

Cut six oranges in halves. With a silver spoon take out 
the pulp and mix with half a cup of sugar and the juice of 
half a lemon. Set in the ice-box with the halves of the skins 
in cups. When ready to serve, fill the cups, put a tablespoon 
of whipped cream on each, and allow two cups to each plate. 

PEACH COBBLER 

Cut peaches in half, cover with water, sweeten very sweet, 
and stew slowly until rich, adding a few stones to improve 
the flavor. When done lay in good quantity in a square 
baking-pan, and almost cover with the juice. Sprinkle flour 
thickly over the peaches and cover with a piecrust quarter 
of an inch thick. Bake a nice brown. When done lift the 
piecrust and turn it over on a platter. Pile the peaches on the 
upturned crust, and add the juice about the crust. Serve hot 
with rich cream. 

PEACH GELATINE 

Dissolve half a box of gelatine in half a teacup of cold 
water. Boil a pint and a half of milk with half a cup of 
sugar. Pour a little of the hot milk over the gelatine to dis- 
solve it thoroughly, and then simmer all together ten minutes 
and set to cool. Peel and slice half a dozen large, fully ripe 
peaches, or if your peaches are small, use a larger number. 



278 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

When the gelatine mixture is cool, but not stiff, stir in the 
sliced peaches and set to chill. Serve with cream ; and also 
sugar if wished. 

PEACH PUDDING 

Peel enough peaches to fill the average pudding dish — 
do not take out the pits. Add about two cups of water, cover 
tight and bake till the peaches are tender. Take the water 
in which the peaches have cooked and to it add a mixture 
made as follows : Beat well four eggs, add a cup of milk, a 
cup of sugar, half a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of butter, 
and a cup of flour into which a teaspoon of baking powder 
has been sifted. Stir together. There should be a thin batter. 
Pour over the peaches, set in the oven and bake till brown. 
Serve with cream. 

PEACH TAPIOCA 

Wash and soak overnight a cup of tapioca. Next morning 
set the tapioca to boil in a pint of boiling water. It is best 
to use a double-boiler. Boil slowly until the tapioca is clear. 
Then stir in a can of peaches. Put in a dish and serve cold 
with cream and sugar. 

PINEAPPLE WITH STRAWBERRIES 

When selecting pineapples pull the centre spines from the 
crown. If they come out easily the fruit is ripe and in con- 
dition to use. If sliced first, the peel can be removed much 
easier than paring the fruit whole. Slice with a sharp knife; 
then, after paring, with a pointed knife remove the eyes. 
Shredding is done by placing the sliced fruit on to a platter 
and picking it with a silver fork. 

It is popular to serve this fruit in the shell. Cut the 
crown about one inch from the top. With a sharp-pointed 
spoon remove all of the pulp, leaving the shell perfect. Shred 
the pulp, discarding the hard centre; add to this pulp halved 
strawberries, enough sugar to sweeten, and put back into the 
shell. Stand on ice until wanted. Then heap whipped cream 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 279 

or ice cream, flavored with pineapple, on top. Serve on a dish 
with the spines about the base. [See ilktstration, Plate XXIV.] 

PRUNES WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Stew till tender half a pound of prunes. Drain off the 
water, take out the pits, mash the prunes, and stir in sweet- 
ened whipped cream — a pint or half a pint, as your taste and 
convenience directs. Put into small cups, chill in the ice-box, 
and drop a spoon of whipped cream in each cup as the sweet 
is served. 

PRUNE PUDDING 

After thoroughly washing one pound of prunes, stew 
them till tender. Put them through a colander and add two 
cups of sugar. Beat to a stiflf froth the whites of five eggs 
and stir in the prunes. Pour into a pudding dish and bake 
ten minutes. 

For the sauce to the prunes heat a pint of milk in a double- 
boiler, add a little sugar to your taste, the yolks of the five 
eggs and a dash of vanilla. Cook a moment after the 
yolks are in. Instead of this sauce cream may be used. 

PUMPKIN CUSTARD 

The old-fashioned red pumpkins are apt to be the best. 
Cut new-moon shaped pieces from a ripe pumpkin and free 
the pieces from seed and rind. Cut in small squares or dice, 
put them in a steamer over a kettle of boiling water and steam 




Small Custard Cups 

till tender. Next press through a sieve or colander. To a 
quart of milk add five beaten eggs, two cups of sugar, half a 
teaspoon of salt and half a nutmeg. If you beat into the sugar 
before it is added a piece of butter the size of an egg the dish 



280 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

is improved, but the butter is not necessary. Next stir in 
enough of the cooked and sifted pumpkin to make the custard 
creamy. Pour into small custard cups and bake slowly till 
well cooked through, and serve cold, capped with whipped 
cream. 

RASPBERRY CREAM 

Soak half an ounce of gelatine in quarter of a pint of 
water. Set in a saucepan over the fire and dissolve, stirring 
all the time. When it boils add one heaping tablespoon of 
sugar and the juice of half a lemon. Put a teacup of rasp- 
berry jam through a sieve, softening with half a teacup of 
milk or water. To this add the gelatine, and then beat in half 
a pint of thick cream you have previously whipped stiff. Put 
in the whipped cream little by little. Stir or beat till it begins 
to set, then pour in a bowl or other mold, and chill near ice. 

RED RASPBERRY SAGO 

Wash half a pint of sago, cover with a pint and a half of 
cold water, soak an hour, and then cook in a double-boiler till 
the sago is clear and transparent. Have carefully looked over 
red raspberries half filling a glass dish. When the sago is 
cool, almost cold, pour it over the raspberries, and set away to 
cool. Serve with sugar and cream. 

Other fruits, such as pineapple and ripe peaches cut in 
small pieces, and strawberries, may be prepared with sago by 
these rules. 

RICE CREAM 

Boil four ounces of rice ten minutes. Pour ofif the water, 
add a quart and a half of fresh milk and cook slowly till the 
rice is tender. Reduce the rice to a pulp by putting through 
a sieve or press. Dissolve an ounce of gelatine in a little water 
and add it to the rice. Stir all together, the milk, rice, and 
gelatine over the fire and sweeten to taste carefully, not mak- 
ing too sweet. When mixed set to cool, and when cool stir 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 281 

in the stiff whites of two eggs. Flavor with vanilla or 
sherry or brandy, or what your taste directs ; pour in a bowl 
or mold and chill for eating. 

SCALLOPED RHUBARB OR PIEPLANT 

For this breadcrumbs may be used or slices of bread but- 
tered. If you use breadcrumbs allow two tablespoons of 
melted butter to a cup of fine crumbs. Cut rhubarb into small 
cubes or dice and in a pudding dish spread a layer of the but- 
tered bread or breadcrumbs. Over this put a layer of the 
rhubarb dice, a plentiful sprinkling of sugar, and, if you like 
their addition, a few stoned raisins. Repeat the layer of 
bread and the layer of rhubarb and sugar until you com- 
plete your dish, and have a bread layer on top. Pour in enough 
boiling water to cook the plant with steam, cover tight and 
bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. Serve 
with a hard sauce of sugar and butter mixed and flavored 
with nutmeg or lemon. 

RHUBARB JELLY AND WHIPPED CREAM 

There are many ways to prepare rhubarb, each one de- 
licious and not extravagant. When tender the plant should 
not be stripped, as the red skin imparts a delicate flavor and 
temptingly rich appearance to the food. Should the plant be 
tough, strip off the skin, and clip the tough ends at the bottom. 
Wipe each stalk with a damp cloth before peeling. 

Allow one pound of sugar and one box of gelatine to one 
quart of prepared rhubarb. Stew the sugar and plant to- 
gether, only add one tablespoon of water. Soak the gelatine 
in one cup of cold water. Then add it to the hot sauce, stirring 
until dissolved. Press through a sieve ; pour into a mold or 
a deep bowl and set on ice to stiffen. When ready to serve 
dip the bowl in hot water a moment, invert on to a cold dish 
and garnish with whipped cream. [See illustration, Plate 
XXIV.] 



282 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SNOW PUDDING 
Soak two teaspoons of gelatine in a little cold water. Dis- 
solve a cup of sugar in a pint of boiling water and pour 
over the gelatine, stirring all the time. Next add the juice 
of two lemons, and set to cool. Beat the whites of two eggs 
and add when it is cool, and then beat half an hour. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE 
Mix thoroughly with one quart of flour three teaspoons of 
baking powder, an ounce or a tablespoon of butter, and a 
pinch of salt. Wet this mixture with a pint of milk. Stir it 
with a spoon, not with the hand, and spread on pie or layer- 
cake tin, making the dough even and about half an inch 
thick. Set in a moderate oven and increase the heat after 
the shortcake has begun to bake. It will be done in about 
twenty-five minutes. When the cake is thoroughly baked 
slip a sharp, thin knife quite through it, leaving upper and 
under halves. Spread each half with butter on its soft inner 
side. On a deep dish lay one half with butter side up. and 
over it spread thick strawberries which have been sugared, 
crushed a little with a potato masher or punch stick and mixed 
with cream. Next lay on the upper half of the crust with the 
butter side up, and this in turn cover with the sugared, 
crushed and creamed strawberries. You must work fast, 
for the shortcake must be eaten in its first state. Do not dally, 
but send it to the table at once. 

Sweeten the strawberries before you make your dough, 
an hour before use in the cake is none too early, and have 
them ready for instant work. 

TAPIOCA PUDDING 

Soak till soft in cold water — overnight is best — a cup of 
tapioca. Add a quart of milk and half a teaspoon of salt. 

Boil all together till the tapioca is transparent. Put in 

molds to cool, and serve with maple sugar and cream, or 

with canned peaches and cream, or with any tasty fresh or 
preserved fruit as a sauce.

CUSTARD TAPIOCA PUDDING 

Soak overnight in cold water a cup of tapioca. Drain 
off the water, add to it a cup of sugar, a quart of milk and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Put in a double-boiler and cook till 
the tapicoa is transparent. Add two beaten eggs and a tea- 
spoon of vanilla. Take from the fire and pour into the glass 
or other dish in which it is to be served. Serve cold. 

FRUIT TAPIOCA 
Soak overnight two tablespoons of small tapioca. Next 
morning drain and put in a double-boiler with four cups of 
boiling water. Cover close and boil until the tapioca is trans- 
parent. Then add half a teaspoon of salt, one pound of dates 
stoned, one cup of raisins seeded, half a pound of figs, and 
one cup of sugar. Cook one hour, and fifteen minutes before 
the cooking ends add half a teaspoon of vanilla. Pour in a 
mold, and serve cold with cream or with whipped cream.

WE group the following puddings for cool weather be- 
cause they are heartier than the fruits, jellies, and far- 
inaceous sweets going before this note. In cool weather our 
systems crave more substantial foods and readily digest what 
in warm weather might prove difficult. The bread puddings 
following may be used all the year round, but suet, plum, and 
other similar combinations should be reserved for the cool 
days. 

BREAD PUDDING 

Mix into two cups of stale, fine breadcrumbs two table- 
spoons of melted butter, the beaten yolks of four eggs, and 
quarter of a teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water. Let one 
quart of milk just come to boil, take it off, cool, and add to the 
other ingredients. Add nutmeg to taste, and last the whites 
of the four eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Stir the whites in 
lightly with a silver fork. Bake in a greased pudding pan 
a light !:rown. Test it by slipping in the pudding a thin 
knife. If the pudding does not stick to the knife it is done. 
Serve with hard sauce.

COOL WEATHER SWEETS 285 

COCOANUT AND BREAD PUDDING 

Take one quart of breadcrumbs and a cup of grated 
cocoanut. Butter a baking dish and put in layers of bread- 
crumbs and cocoanut till the dish is nearly full. Upon the 
crumbs drop a few pieces of butter. Beat two whole eggs 
and the yolks of two eggs together, add a small cup of sugar, 
half a teaspoon of salt, and a pint of milk. For flavoring use 
the juice of an orange or a teaspoon of vanilla. Pour this 
custard over the breadcrumbs and cocoanut, and bake in a 
moderate oven till the custard is set, but not watery. The 
two whites you have reserved from the yolks beat till stiff, 
add two tablespoons of sugar and the grated rind of the 
orange you used for the pudding, or, if you like, almond or 
vanilla flavoring. Spread upon the cooked pudding, return 
to the moderate oven for a lisrht brown, and serve. 



/- CRUST AND CRUMB PUDDING 

Put your crusts and crumbs of bread into a bowl and 
cover them with milk. Set on the warm water tank or in the 
dish oven to soak for half an hour. Then mash the bread 
with a fork till all is a fine pulp. To two quarts of the pulp 
add a small cup of raisins, a small cup of currants, a large 
cup of milk, a couple of eggs well beaten, a teaspoon of salt, 
and sugar to taste. Guard against making it too sweet. Stir 
well, pour it into a buttered pudding dish and bake in a mod- 
erate oven one hour and a half, and serve hot. 

ORANGE BREAD PUDDING 

Soak a heaping teacup of fine breadcrumbs in a cup of 
cold water till the crumbs are soft. Grate over the bread- 
crumbs the yellow off the rind of three oranges. Take the 
soft broken pulp of five large oranges, or of six small ones, 
and stir in the crumbs. Stir together quarter of a cup of 
butter, a cup and a half of sugar, and the yolks of four eggs. 
Stir in the breadcrumbs and bake half an hour in a moderate 
oven. Beat the whites of the eggs stiff, add sugar to make a 



286 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

meringue, put on the pudding and let stand in a moderate 
oven ten minutes to brown. 

COTTAGE PUDDING 

Beat two eggs and stir well into them one teaspoon of 
butter, one cup of fresh milk, one pint of flour, and one and 
a half teaspoons of baking powder. Bake in a shallow, 
square tin, and serve fresh from the oven with a hot liquid 
sauce, or with "Sour Cream Sauce." 

CUSTARD AND CURRANT PUDDING 

Put in the bottom of a well-buttered pudding dish a 
layer of thin slices of bread and butter. Sprinkle over this 
some well-washed currants, and if you have it a few bits of 
candied orange peel. Lay in again thin slices of bread and 
butter and repeat the layer of the fruit. So continue to alter- 
nate till your dish is full, topping ofif with the currants. Over 
these layers pour a plain custard made from two or three 
eggs to a quart of milk, and sweetened and flavored to your 
taste. Pour gently in order not to disturb the layers of the 
pudding. Set in a moderate oven and bake half an hour, or 
until the custard is set, but not until it becomes watery. 

. BOILED FIG PUDDING 

Add to half a pound of suet half a pound of stale bread- 
crumbs, half a pound of sugar, and half a pound of figs 
chopped fine. Mix together. Next put in three beaten eggs 
and half a teaspoon of soda dissolved in one teacup of milk. 
Grate into this one small nutmeg. Add one wineglass of 
brandy (California), and last one teaspoon of cream of tartar. 
Grease a square pudding cloth lightly, sprinkle it with flour. 
Lay the cloth over a colander. Pour into it the pudding. 
Gather up the cloth and tie firmly, allowing a little space for 
the pudding to swell. Put it in a pot of boiling water. Fas- 
ten the ends of the cloth down with the coyer of the pot. Set 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 287 

a weight on top of it. Boil without stopping three hours. 
Serve with Hquid or hard sauce. The latter is preferred for 
this pudding. 

BAKED FLOUR PUDDING 

Put into one pint of sifted flour one teaspoon of salt and 
seven well-beaten eggs. Stir hard, and add to this one quart 
of milk, mix well. Grease a pudding dish, and pour the 
mixture in it. Bake in a moderate oven about one hour. If 
it browns too fast set a pan of warm water in the upper oven 
above it. Serve as soon as done, or the pudding will fall. 
For this use liquid sauce. 

BOILED FLOUR PUDDING 

Put into one pint of sifted flour one teaspoon of salt and 
seven well-beaten eggs, and stir hard. Add to this one quart 
of milk and mix well. Grease a square cloth, sift flour 
lightly over it, lay it over a pan, pour the pudding into it, 
gather up the cloth, tie it, leaving room for the pudding to 
swell. Have ready a pot of boiling water, put the pudding 
in, leaving the end of the cloth outside to prevent the pud- 
ding turning over. Put on the cover and lay a weight or 
flatiron on the top to hold it down. Keep the pot boiling 
steadily for one hour. Never let the boiling stop, or there 
will be a heavy streak in the pudding. When done turn out 
on a plate, and serve with hard sauce, and serve at once. 

FRUIT FRITTERS 

Beat the yolks of two eggs with a teacup of flour and a 
pinch of salt. Add one tablespoon of olive oil, two table- 
spoons of Jamaica rum, or lemon- juice, and cold batter enough 
to make a creamy batter. When ready to fry, stir in the stiffly 
beaten whites of the eggs. Dip any kind" of fruit, pared and 
sliced, in this batter. Fry in deep boiling fat. Serve with 
liquid sauce. 



288 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

FARMERS' FRUIT PUDDING 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg and a cup of sweet 
milk. Add flour enough to make a batter that will spread 
easily with a spoon. Add also three teaspoons of baking 
powder. Butter a baking dish. Put in a layer of batter, then 
a layer of fruit, such as blueberries, blackberries, then a 
layer of batter, then fruit, and so on till you have used your 
batter. Have the top layer of batter. Bake in a hot oven 
half an hour or more, or until done. Serve with a hard sauce 
or a liquid sauce, as you choose. 

STEAMED FRUIT PUDDING 

Take half a teacup of New Orleans molasses, one teacup 
of suet chopped very fine, little more than half a teacup of 
hot water, and one teaspoon of salt. Next two beaten eggs, 
one heaping teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water, two 
teaspoons of allspice, two teaspoons of cinnamon, three- 
quarters of a teaspoon of cloves, half a nutmeg, three table- 
spoons of vinegar, one teaspoon of pure ammonia (from a 
druggist), one cup and a half of dried currants, and one cup 
and a half of raisins stoned, and chopped moderately fine. 
Now stir in three teacups of flour, and in one of the tea- 
cups of flour (the first one) stir two heaping teaspoons of 
cream of tartar. Set a steamer over a pot of boiHng water, 
lay a perforated tin pie plate upside down in the bottom of 
the steamer. Grease a cake pan thoroughly, put your pud- 
ding in it and set it on the pie pan. Lay over the top of the 
steamer a piece of thick cloth (or two pieces), cut round, 
to fall a little below the steamer. Put on the lid, and set a 
heavy weight or a flatiron on top. Boil steadily without its 
stopping a moment for three hours. At the end of that 
time take out the pan from the steamer and serve. If you 
wish to keep it, set aside to get cool. When almost cold, 
turn it on a plate, leaving the under side on top. This pud- 
ding will keep for two weeks or more. It can be reheated 
and steamed soft by laying an old napkin or a piece of soft 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 289 

muslin in a large colander, setting in the pudding, turning 
the cloth ends over it and covering the whole with a cover. 
Set the colander over a large saucepan of water and keep boil- 
ing until the pudding is soft, which will be in about an hour. 
Serve with liquid sauce, page 294. 

GERMAN PANCAKES 

A nice dessert is a very light wheat flour batter cake, baked 
the diameter of a coffee saucer. When baked a light brown 
lay it on a hot plate. Put in the centre a tablespoon of rasp- 
berry, blackberry, or any other sweet jam. Fold one-half of 
the cake over the other half. Sift thickly with powdered 
sugar, and serve hot. This is for one person only. 

BAKED INDIAN PUDDING 

Mix half a pint of water and one pint of milk. Scald, 
and while boiling hot pour little by little upon six tablespoons 
of Indian meal. Stir in a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
a little salt, three tablespoons of sugar, two tablespoons of 
molasses, and one egg. Beat all together and bake in a very 
slow oven three or four hours. 

BOILED INDIAN PUDDING 

Mix through a teacup of flour one heaping teaspoon of 
baking powder and one heaping teaspoon of salt. Add one 
pint of milk, two tablespoons of melted butter, or four table- 
spoons of sour cream, three beaten eggs, one small pinch 
of soda, and one pint of cornmeal to make a stiff batter. 
Pour this into a greased one-pound baking powder can, or 
any can of convenient size (a small tin bucket is good). Set 
the can on a plate in a pot in which there is enough boiling 
water to come nearly to the top of the can or bucket. Place 
a weight upon it to keep it upright. Boil two hours. To be 
eaten vv^ith maple sugar shaved into a bowl of sweet cream. 
Sour cream also may be used as a sauce. y , ^ 



290 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

PLUM PUDDING 

Put three-fourths of a pound of stale breadcrumbs into a 
bowl. Add one pound of seeded and chopped raisins, one 
pound of beef suet minced, one-fourth of a pound of brown 
sugar, the grated rind of one lemon, one-fourth of a pound 
of flour, one teaspoon of grated nutmeg, one pound of dried 
currants, half a cup of shredded almonds, half a pound of 
shredded candied orange and lemon peel, one-fourth of a 
pound of shredded citron, half a pint of brandy, and five eggs. 
Mix. Pour into a greased, covered mold and boil for six 
hours. The day you serve it reboil for six hours longer. 
Serve on a platter. Surround the pudding wath loaf sugar, 
pour brandy over it, ignite the brandy, and send the pud- 
ding to the table with the brandy burning. Serve with a 
hard sauce flavored with lemon- juice or brandy. 

ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING 

Clean, wash and dry one pound of currants and stone 
one pound of raisins. Chop fine one pound of suet. Mix 
these wath quarter of a pound of flour and three-quarters of 
a pound of fine breadcrumbs. Grate in half a nutmeg, the 
rind of one lemon, and add quarter of a pound of brown 
sugar and half a pound of shredded and candied orange peel 
cut in small pieces. Have all these ingredients well mixed. 
Then beat five eggs, pour them into half a pint of brandy, 
stirring all the time, and pour over the ingredients you have 
previously mixed. Stir all together thoroughly. You will 
have six pounds. Put in small, well-greased molds and boil 
six hours. When you Avant the puddings for use, boil an- 
other six hours. [See illustration, Plate XXV.] 

PLUM GRAHAM PUDDING 

Have a cup of raisins seeded, chopped, and lightly 
dredged, and one cup of molasses into which two teaspoons 
of soda dissolved in a tablespoon of water have been beaten. 
Add the raisins and molasses to a cup of fresh milk, and a 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 291 

teaspoon of salt, and stir in two cups of graham flour. Work 
quickly to catch the molasses in its foam. Pour into a but- 
tered pudding mold, cover tight, and plunge in a kettle of 
boiling water to boil three hours without let up. When 
cooked tip the mold upside down, slip out the pudding, and 
serve steaming hot with liquid sauce. 

BOILED PRUNE PUDDING 

Chop fine six ounces of suet and mix in six ounces of 
breadcrmnbs. Free from the pits and chop half a pound of 
prunes and add them to the suet. Add also a heaping table- 
spoon of sugar and half a teaspoon of salt. Beat three eggs 
and mix with a gill of milk. Pour this over the other in- 
gredients and let stand. Oil or grease a pudding boiler, 
pour in the pudding, set in a saucepan of boiling water so 
that the water will reach three-quarters of the way to the 
top of the pudding boiler, and cook for three hours. Twist 
over the top of the pudding boiler a piece of oiled or greased 
paper to keep out water and steam while cooking. 

SPONGE PUDDING 

Mix quarter of a cup of sugar w'ith half a cup of flour. 
Wet with a little cold milk from a pint of fresh milk. The 
rest of the pint heat in a double-boiler. Stir in the hot milk 
the sugar and flour and cook till thick and smooth. Add half 
a cup of butter, and w^hen well mixed stir in the well-beaten 
yolks of five eggs. Afterward add the whites of the eggs 
beaten stiff. Pour in well-buttered cups or in a shallow dish, 
set in a pan of hot water in a hot oven and bake about thirty 
minutes. Serve hot with creamy sauce. 

BOILED SUET PUDDING 

Have a cup of finely chopped suet, and a cup of seeded 
raisins lightly dredged. With these stir a cup of molasses, 
a cup of milk, one egg, a teaspoon of ginger, and three and a 
half cups of flour into which two teaspoons of baking powder 



292 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

have been sifted. Butter a mold for steaming puddings, pour 
in the batter, cover tight, and steam for three hours. Serve 
with a hquid or brandy sauce. 

BRANDY SAUCE 
Mix together a heaping tablespoon of flour and a cup of 
sugar. Over this pour gradually a pint of boiling water 
and cook in a pan of hot water till the flour thickens, which 
will be in about fifteen minutes. Then gradually stir in half 
a cup of butter and half a cup of brandy. Vanilla and the 
grated rind and juice of a lemon may be used for flavoring 
instead of the brandy. 

CARAMEL SAUCE 
Put half a cup of sugar in a saucepan and stir over the fire 
till brown. Add half a cup of boiling water and simmer ten 
or fifteen minutes. 

CHOCOLATE SAUCE 

Dissolve two ounces of chocolate in a pint of milk in a 
double-boiler. Thicken with a tablespoon of cornstarch dis- 
solved in two tablespoons of milk, and then sweeten with 
three-fourths of a cup of sugar. Add a flavoring of vanilla, 
if your taste so directs. Put through a sieve if you are not 
sure it is smooth. 

CREAMY SAUCE 
Blend in a saucepan over a slow fire three tablespoons of 
butter with one heaping tablespoon of flour. Add half a 
cup of sugar and a cup of rich milk. Take from the stove 
when all is creamy, and add the juice of a lemon and an 
orange. Serve cold. This sauce may be flavored with wine 
or rum instead of orange and lemon. 

HARD SAUCE 
Cream together half a cup of butter and a cup of sugar, 
adding the sugar in four separate divisions. When well 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 293 

mixed together stir in gradually the white of one egg, and 
drop by drop whatever flavoring you wish to use. Some- 
times nutmeg alone is used; again vanilla, or California 
claret, or brandy. Also the juice of strawberries, currants, or 
raspberries. 

CHERRY SAUCE 

Make the foregoing "Hard Sauce" and mix in it a cup of 
stoned and mashed cherries. 

' PEACH SAUCE 

Follow the directions for "Hard Sauce" and mix in a cup 
of peach pulp. 

FROTHY SAUCE 

Beat one egg to a stiff froth. Add three-quarters of a cup 
of sugar and the juice of half a lemon, or lemon extract to 
taste. Just before sending to the table, beat in half a cup of 
scalded milk. 

SAUCE OF FRUIT JUICE 

Add half a cup of water to a quart of crushed cherries or 
berries — either strawberries or currants, or red or black rasp- 
berries, or stewed gooseberries — and boil gently twenty min- 
utes. Put in a cheesecloth bag and drain. To one pint of 
juice add half a cup of sugar (put in a little more sugar if 
your fruit is very sour, but have care not to get it too sweet)- 
Add also to a pint of juice a heaping tablespoon of corn- 
starch. Bring to boil, cook ten or fifteen minutes, and serve 
hot. 

LEMON SAUCE 

Cream half a cup of butter and a cup of sugar. Then 
gradually beat in the whites of two eggs. Set over a kettle, 
or in a pan of hot water, and stir in half a cup of boiling 
water and the juice and grated rind of a small lemon. Serve 
hot. 



294 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

LIQUID SAUCE 
Take two heaping tablespoons of flour and two heaping 
tablespoons of butter, mash together and dissolve in two tea- 
cups of hot water poured gradually over them. Add two 
heaping tablespoons and a half of sugar, a little grated nut- 
meg, and two slices of fresh lemon. Mix in a small sauce- 
pan. Set in another containing water. Let the water 
gradually heat until boiling. Stir constantly with a table- 
spoon to prevent lumping and to have it perfectly smooth. 
Let it be rather thick when done, and add three tablespoons 
of California brandy. Stand in the hot water to keep hot 
until ready to serve, and take out the lemon before serving. 

MAPLE SUGAR AND CREAM SAUCE 

Shave off in fine shavings the maple sugar you wish to 
use, and stir it into half its quantity of thick cream. Stir so 
that the sugar stands through the cream. Sour cream is 
sometimes used instead of sweet cream. Either combines 
deliciously with the sugar. 

MOLASSES SAUCE 

Cook together in a saucepan a cup of molasses, a table- 
spoon of butter, and two tablespoons of cream. Boil slowly 
until a little thick, and then add the grated rind and juice of 
a lemon. Or the lemon may be omitted, and in its stead a 
tablespoon of ginger added. 

SOUR CREAM SAUCES 

Delicious sauces are made from cream that has turned 
sour. One sauce is made by beating scraped maple sugar 
into the cream, allowing a good deal of the rich cream to the 
sugar. The sauce is used for hot boiled Indian pudding. 

Another sauce made from sour cream is to beat in granu- 
lated or pulverized sugar, and to add the rind and juice of a 
lemon — for enough sauce for six persons. This may be eaten 
with bread puddings or with "Cottage Pudding." 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 295 

VANILLA SAUCE 

Stir water in a tablespoon of cornstarch slowly until you 
have used a cup. x\dd a cup of sugar and cook in a double- 
boiler till the cornstarch is cooked through and thickens — 
this will take ten or fifteen minutes. Add an even tablespoon 
of butter and half a teaspoon of vanilla, stir these in quickly, 
and serve hot. 

WHIPPED CREAM SAUCE 

Beat together the yolks of three eggs and two heaping 
tablespoons of sugar. Add the juice of a lemon. Heat in 
a saucepan, stir well, but do not boil. Take from the fire 
and beat in a pint of whipped cream. Chill and serve.

A LESSON IN CAKEMAKING 

TO begin with the first steps in the science of mixing, I will 
choose for the lesson a snow cake, one of the simplest, 
most delicate and inexpensive of cakes. This receipt makes 
a good-sized loaf or a large layer cake, using only the whites 
of two eggs, a very satisfactory item in these days of high 
prices. No cake in the great assortment of cakes I might 
choose from is so tender of grain, so delicious, so crisp of 
crust or so all round satisfactory as this is. The receipt is 
one in everyday use in my own household, because it is 
capable of infinite variation in the hands of an adaptive cook. 
Here it is : 

SNOW CAKE 
Cream together quarter of a cup of butter and one cup of 
sugar, then add half a cup of milk and one and two-thirds of 
a cup of flour sifted with two and a half teaspoons of baking 
powder, adding flour and milk alternately in small quantities. 
When perfectly smooth and white, fold in the whites of two 
eggs beaten to a stifif froth. Flavor with half a teaspoon of 
vanilla. 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 207 

Before beginning the work, let me impress on you that 
poor materials will never make good cake. One needs good 
sugar, the best of tub butter, perfectly fresh eggs and pastry 
flour to have delicate tasting, fine-grained, crisply crusted 
cake. If poor cooking butter or eggs of a doubtful age are 
used, it is of no avail tr}'ing to disguise the fact by adding 
a double portion of vanilla ; the strongest taste is uppermost. 

Before beginning work, get all your materials ready. 
Sift the flour and lift from it one and two-thirds level cups, 
smoothing off the top with a knife ; for in this receipt, and in 
all others I give, the measurements are level, unless other- 
wise stated. Put the flour and baking powder in the sifter. 
Butter the cake pans with a bristle brush and sift flour into it 
till a coating of wdiite covers the inside of the tin. This gives 
a fine crust ; it is easier than lining a tin w' ith buttered -paper, 
and the cake is not liable to burn. Measure the butter, sugar, 
and milk, separate the egg, and see that the oven is in good 
condition. If you bake in a gas stove, light both oven 
burners ; it takes about as long for the oven to heat as it does 
to mix the cake. 

If the w^eather is cold and the butter is hard, warm an 
earthen bowd by allowing hot w^ater to stand in it for a few 
minutes. Pour it out, dry the bow'l, then put the butter to 
soften, but never to melt. Butter which has melted will never 
produce a smooth white cream. Take a wooden slitted spoon 
and beat the butter till creamy ; this process allows of a per- 
fect blending with the sugar, which add gradually, beating 
constantly all the time. When the cream mixture is light 
and snowy white, sift in a few spoons of flour to keep the 
butter and sugar from separating, as would happen if the 
milk went in first. By the way, always use a slitted spoon 
when making cake. The air, wdiich you are endeavoring to 
beat into the cake, is caught and driven through the slits 
and a perfect blending of ingredients can be quickly accom- 
plished. With the ordinary bowlspoon this process is arrived 
at very slowly. Few cooks realize what an important factor 
quickness is in the beating of cake. The w^oman of slow. 



298 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

deliberate motions will invariably turn out a heavy cake ; the 
quick, energetic cook will have a light, delicious cake. I 
have seen this result many times in cooking school, where 
the same materials, the same utensils, the same well-tempered 
stove were at the disposal of women of different temperaments. 
To turn again to the cake, which we left at the stage of 
thoroughly creamed butter and sugar, with a small amount 
of flour sifted in. Add now a few tablespoons of milk, and 
beat; then sift in half a cup of flour till it is all in and you 
have a snowy, light batter. If you are making the cake alone, 
stop now and beat the whites of the eggs. If some one can 
help it would be better, at the time you begin the creaming of 
the butter, that she commence to beat the eggs. When they 
reach the light, dry, frothy condition which is a necessity, 
the cake mixture would be ready to have them folded in. If 
you have to beat the white of egg yourself, it is better to 
allow the cake to wait for it than to let it wait for the cake. 
No matter how well whipped it has been, the air will escape 
from it and it will go back to a condition from which it can 
never again be beaten stiff. When it is thoroughly whipped, 
fold it into the batter. By folding I mean put the spoon in 
edgewise, lift the batter, and turn it over. Repeat until thor- 
oughly mixed. 

At this point the batter holds millions of little air cells 
obtained by beating, and the bubbles formed by whipping 
air into the whites of the eggs. If at this point the batter is 
subjected to further beating, the imprisoned air bubbles would 
be liberated and the cake would be heavy. Therefore, put it 
immediately into the oven for the air cells to be set by the heat. 

There is a certain knack in pouring cake batter into the 
pans, which results in a perfectly flat, well-shaped cake. 
Smooth the batter after it is all in with a spatula, having the 
mixture come well to the corners and sides of the pans, leaving 
a slight depression in the centre. Never scrape batter from 
a knife or spoon on the edge of the pan. If you do, the cake 
will not rise on that side. Fill the pans three-quarters full if 
vou wish the cake to reach the top of the tins. 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 299 

As to the time and temperature for the baking of cake, 
consider its thickness. Small patty-pan cakes and layer cakes 
require a much hotter oven than loaf cake. If you are using 
a gas range, turn on both burners for the small or thin cakes ; 
they ought to bake in twent}- or thirty minutes. A loaf cake 
requires a slower heat. Both demand the heat at the begin- 
ning coming from below, while all the tiny air-cells are swell- 
ing larger and larger. If the heat were to come from above, 
a crust would form, the rising process would end in the 
bubbles bursting and the mixture settling down heavy as 
lead. Allow the cake to stand on the lower shelf of the oven 
till the pan is full, then very carefully move it to the highest 
shelf, if it does not seem to be hot enough below. Here it will 
brown more evenly. Always keep the pans as far as pos- 
sible from the sides of the oven ; if not hot enough to burn 
cake, they will likely be hot enough to make it rise unevenly. 

When the following receipts call for the butter to be 
creamed before adding the sugar, this should always be 
heeded. The creaming consists in beating and working the 
butter until it becomes like thick cream. In this way the 
oil cells are broken and the texture of the cake made finer 
in consequence. 

Sifting the flour makes it lighter, and, unless stated other- 
wise, should be measured after sifting. 

It is safer to test the cake batter by dropping a little on a 
small pan and baking. If it spreads and is flat, the batter 
needs more flour. If tough, it needs a little more milk. Some 
flour thickens more readily than others, so the exact amount 
can not be judged. 

When using bicarbonate of soda, a level teaspoon is meant 
unless otherwise stated. 

CAKES FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 

Many housekeepers look aghast when the question of 
decorating cakes comes up, and it arises quite often in a 
family where there are young folk. Every housekeeper may 



300 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

try her hand at this feature, which does not involve much 
extra trouble and needs very little skill. 

Once in a while a prettily decorated cake brought to the 
table when there are no guests other than one's immediate 
family will elicit many encomiums and also tempt the appe- 
tite. 

To write the name on a birthday cake no expensive ap- 
paratus is required: just a couple of cornucopias made of 
thick writing paper and sewed up the side. When the cake 
is ready, cover thickly with icing and set until firm. Fill 
the cornucopia with whatever icing the decoration is to be 
of, then, holding steadily in the left hand, commence to press 
from the larger end toward the smaller, pressing the icing 
out in a slender line from the opening. Roses and other 
flowers and geometrical designs and fancy tracings may be 
made. Unless accustomed to this work, it is better to trace 
with a sharp-pointed skewer the design on to the icing first, 
then following it out with the colored. 

ICING 

Beat stiff the white of one egg, stir in a cup of confec- 
tioners' sugar, two teaspoons of cold water, and the flavor 
you choose. Spread the icing upon the cake with a broad- 
bladed knife, constantly dipping the knife in cold water to 
spread the icing smooth. 

ICING FOR CHILDREN'S CAKES 

Put three tablespoons of boiling water on a hot plate and 
stir in icing sugar or confectioners' sugar till you have a soft 
paste. Add as you stir a few drops of the flavoring you 
wish, such as vanilla or lemon. Spread the soft paste on the 
cakes. 

ALAIOND ICE 

Mix half a pound of finely powdered almonds with a pound 
of sugar. Moisten with a dash of orange water and the 
whites of enough eggs to make a paste. With this coat the 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 301 

cake. Over the almond icing a second icing is sometimes 
laid, prepared in the following way: Work a pound and a 
half of fine sugar into the whites of eight eggs, adding, now 
and then a dash of lemon- juice. You will have a thick, glisten- 
ing mass. Coat the cake, and dry in a warm, clear air. 

BOILED ICING 

Boil together a cup of sugar and half a cup of water till 
the syrup hairs ofif a spoon. Take from the fire, and while 
cooling beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth. Stir the 
whites and the syrup together, beating the syrup in with the 
movement you have beaten the eggs. Use whatever flavor 
you choose, or whatever fruits. 

CLEAR ICING 

Stir together half a pound of powdered sugar and the 
whites of two eggs. Then add the juice of half a lemon, 
and stir till clear. Use at once. 

APPLE FROSTING 

Follow the directions for "Clear Icing," but instead of 
adding the lemon add a cup of grated apple — having peeled 
and grated fine, juicy, tart apples. 

CREAM ICING 

Mix together a small half of a cup of thick cream and 
two cups of powdered sugar. Flavor with vanilla, or what- 
ever you prefer. 

ROYAL ICING 

Put the white of an egg in a bowl and add a tablespoon 
of water, and the same quantity of lemon-juice, or other 
flavoring if you wish. Beat a moment, and then stir in 
powdered sugar until the icing is of the thickness that will 
spread upon a warm cake. Beat hard five minutes, and then 



302 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pile in tlie centre of the cake and with a wet knife blade smooth 
round and down the sides of the cake. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI ICING 
Boil a pound of sugar in a gill of water until the syrup 
will hair off the spoon. Take from the fire, add slowly the 
beaten whites of two eggs and beat all together, adding also 
half a pound of blanched and chopped almonds, quarter of 
a pound of fine raisins swelled in hot w-ater, and quarter of a 
pound of citron cut in little pieces. 

CARAMEL FILLING 

Mix two cups of heavy brown sugar with three-fourths 
of a cup of butter and add half a cup of cream. Boil in a 
saucepan until it becomes ropy, and then add one tablespoon 
of vanilla. Put the saucepan in cold water and stir until the 
filling thickens. Spread between layers of cold cake. 

To use the above as candy spread it on a cold, buttered 
platter. When cold and hardened somewhat cut in cubes, and 
allow to harden more before using. 

CHOCOLATE FILLING 
Mix the yolks of four eggs with one square of chocolate 
grated, one tablespoon of cream or milk and one cup of sugar. 
Boil till it grows hard. 

SOUR CREAM FILLING 
Add the white of one &gg to a cup of thick, sour cream 
to keep the cream from turning to butter while whipping. 
Whip the cream, sweeten to taste with pow^dered sugar and 
flavor to your taste wath vanilla. Spread upon cool layers 
of cake. Chopped nuts, such as butternuts, pecans, or hickory- 
nuts, are sometimes added to this cream filling. 

FILLINGS OF FRESH FRUIT 
Fillings of fresh fruit are made by putting layers of the 
sugared fruit between the layers of cake, and spreading 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 303 

whipped cream over the fruit. Take for instance straw- 
berries. Mash the strawberries, and sugar to taste. If the 
juice is too plentiful let it drain off and use it for flavoring- 
on ice. On a layer of cake spread the strawberries. Have 
whipped a cup of cream with tw^o tablespoons of sugar. 
Spread over the strawberries some of this cream, then put 
on the other layer and repeat the fruit and cream. 

Peaches may be used in this way. Raspberries also, and 
pineapple grated. 

LEMON FILLING 

Mix two cups of sugar, two teaspoons of butter, the grated 
rind and juice of two lemons, and two eggs. Stir together 
and put in a saucepan. Set the pan in another of hot water, 
and boil until the mixture is quite thick. When cool, spread on 
the layers of cake. 

MAPLE FILLING 

Boil a cup of maple syrup till it threads from the spoon, 
and then beat till cool, beating in the white of an egg. 

NUT FILLING 

Boil together half a cup of water and a cup of sugar 
until it makes a heavy thread. Take from the fire and add 
little by little and with constant stirring the whites of two 
eggs. Beat till cool, stirring in a cup of chopped nuts, either 
walnuts, hickory nuts, or mixed nuts. 

FRUIT FILLING 

Follow the directions above, using candied fruits or 
chopped and seeded raisins instead of nuts. 

FILLING FOR ANY FLAVOR 

A soft filling to which may be added any flavor is made 
by following the directions for "Nut Filling," substituting a 
flavoring for the nuts.

ANGEL CAKE 

Beat to a very stiff froth the whites of eleven eggs. To 
this add a tumbler of white sugar and about two teaspoons 
of vanilla to taste. Mix one scant even teaspoon of cream 
of tartar into one tumbler of flour. Sift it four times, the 
last time sift into the eggs and sugar and mix together. Put 
in a round pan with circular metal rising in the centre. The 
pan should not be greased. Bake in a moderate oven until 
a straw thrust in will come out clean — that is, twenty or 
twenty-five minutes. Bake a very light brown, and delicately. 

ANGEL FOOD 

Sift together four times a cup of flour (measure after sift- 
ing) and a teaspoon of cream of tartar. Beat the whites of 
eleven eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat in gradually a cup and 
a half of granulated sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. Next 
put in the flour which you have sifted with the cream of tartar 
and beat lightly. Bake slowly forty minutes in a pan lightly 
dredged with flour, or in an earthenware dish. The cake 
should bake gradually. 

DRIED APPLE CAKE 

Put to soak overnight a cup and a half of evaporated 
apples. Stew them soft in half a cup of molasses the next 
day, and set away to cool. Stir together half a cup of butter 
and one cup of sugar. Add two-thirds of a cup of sour milk, 
the stewed apples, two well-beaten eggs, a teaspoon each of 
cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and three cups of flour into 
which you have sifted a teaspoon of finely pulverized soda. 
Stir hard. Have at hand a cup of seeded raisins, two-thirds 
of a cup of currants, and some thin slices of shredded citron. 
Spread a layer of the cake batter in your cake tin, then put 
in a layer of your mixed raisins, currants, and citron. Next 
a layer of batter and then a layer of fruit, and so on till you 
cap the cake with a layer of batter. Bake carefully in a 
moderate oven.

BAKER'S CAKE 

Cream together one cup of butter with two cups of 
granulated sugar. Add the yolks of six eggs, beating in one 
yolk at a time. Add little by little one cup of sweet milk, 
which you have warmed. Then put in three cups of sifted 
flour little at a time, stirring constantly until all is well 
mixed. Add the whites of the eggs which you have beaten 
to a stiff froth, folding them in gradually, and last of all 
three teaspoons of baking powder. Flavor with two tea- 
spoons of vanilla, or the juice of one lemon. Bake in a quick 
oven, either as a loaf cake or in jelly cake tins. The secret of 
having the cake light is in the stirring. 

A BIRTHDAY CAKE 

One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, four eggs, two 
tablespoons of molasses, one cup of boiled coffee, three and a 
half cups of pastry flour, five level teaspoons of baking 
powder, one teaspoon of powdered cinnamon, half a teaspoon 
of powdered cloves, half a teaspoon of powdered mace, three- 
quarters of a cup of seeded and chopped raisins, half a cup 
of shredded figs and citron, two tablespoons of brandy. Mix 
all together in the order given. Bake in a loaf pan. When 
cool, ice with any preferred frosting. Place candles in paste 
roses about and edge with flowers. The candles correspond 
or harmonize with the icing and flowers. [See illustration, 
Plate XXV.] 

BRIDE'S CAKE "^ 

Cream a pound of sugar with half a pound of butter. Beat 
to a stiff froth the whites of sixteen eggs. To the creamed 
butter and sugar add the whites and a pound of flour, beating 
strongly all one way and putting in the flour and white froth 
little by little. Butter white paper, lay it in the cake tin, and 
bake the cake in a quick oven, having care not to jar the 
stove or oven during the baking. 



306 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

CALIFORNIA CAKE 
Stir together two cups of sugar and one of butter till 
you have a cream. Take the yolks of six eggs, beat them 
light, and add to the creamed butter and sugar. Stir in also 
half a teaspoon of cinnamon and the same quantity of nut- 
meg. Then dissolve a teaspoon of soda in a cup of cold 
water and add that. Next beat the whites of the six eggs to 
a stiff froth and lightly fold in, using first the whites and 
then some of the flour from the four cups you have measured 
out and thoroughly sifted together with two teaspoons of 
cream of tartar. When the whites and flour are all in, add a 
pound of raisins, which you have seeded, chopped, and 
dredged with flour, and a cup of walnut or hickory-nut kernels, 
which you have also dredged. Stir all together and bake in 
two or three loaves in a moderate oven. 

CHOCOLATE CAKE 
Dissolve two ounces of chocolate in five tablespoons of 
boiling water. Blend four eggs with half a cup of butter and

of which you have just used the white. When this chocolate 
mixture boils, stir it into the white dough and bake in loaf 
form.

one tablespoon of dry sherry and one teaspoon of vanilla. Then 
add one cup of flour in which has been sifted the baking 
powder. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites ; then the other cup 
of flour. Bake in layers. When cool put together with the 
following : 

CONFECTION FILLING 

Stir one and a half cups of sugar and half a cup of water 
until the sugar is dissolved. Boil until it spins a thread when 
dropped from a spoon. Have ready the whites of two eggs 
beaten stiff and dry; then, while beating constantly, pour the 
hot syrup on them and beat until cold and rather stiff. Add 
one cup of chopped nut-meats, shredded figs and candied fruit,

Take two eggs, one cup of sugar, one cup of thick sour 
cream, half a cup of butter, and two cups of flour. Beat to- 
gether, and beat in also one teaspoon of soda. This cake

Blend well together two cups of sugar and three-fourths 
of a cup of butter. Stir in one cup of milk and the whites 
of eight eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Stir together three cups

sugar and a pound of butter, and then add eight beaten eggs 
and a cup of molasses, half a cup of whiskey, one cup of 
sour cream, and a tablespoon each of mace, cinnamon, cloves, 
allspice, and grated nutmeg. Stir in your pound of browned 
flour and half a teaspoon of soda dissolved, and gradually 
add a pound of seeded raisins, a pound of washed and dried 
currants, and a pound of citron cut in pieces — all the fruit 
being lightly dredged. Bake in well-buttered paper laid in 
deep pans, for this cake should be in large loaves. Be careful 
your oven is not too hot. 

WHITE FRUIT CAKE 

Mix three cups of unadulterated powdered sugar with 
one cup of butter. Add the whites of ten eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth, half a cup of milk, a dash of bitter almond flavor- 
ing, and four cups of flour into which three teaspoons of

three loaves, and bake in a slow oven two and a half or 
three hours. 

SOFT GINGERBREAD 

WITH OR WITHOUT FRUIT 

Take one teacup of dark brown sugar, one large iron 
spoon heaping of butter, and one large iron spoon heaping 
of lard. Cream these smoothly together. Then add one 
scant teacup of hot water, three beaten eggs, one heaping 
teaspoon of soda, one large iron spoon of vinegar, two even 
tablespoons of ground ginger, two teaspoons of cinnamon, 
half a teaspoon of cloves, one teaspoon of salt, and three- 
quarters of a teaspoon of pure ammonia (from a druggist). 
Last, add three cups and a half of flour. Beat thoroughly 
for five minutes. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a mod- 
erate, steady oven. Set a pan of warm water in the upper 
oven. Do not turn the cake round until partly baked, and 
move it slowly. Be careful to close the oven door gently, 
or the cake will fall. Never leave the door open to cool an 
oven. 

If fruit is wished, use one teacup of raisins chopped and 
one teacup of currants, floured well. If you use fruit, bake 
one hour. 

This gingerbread with fruit makes a nice dessert steamed 
and eaten with liquid sauce.

310 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

to make a dough like ordinary cake. Bake in a moderate 
oven.

well-beaten eggs. Add half a nutmeg, two teaspoons of 
ginger, half a teaspoon of salt, and a large spoon of lard or 
butter. Take a cup of cider and pour three-fourths of it 
into the above mixture and stir well. Then add gradually, 
beating thoroughly, three cups of flour. After you have 
put in the last of your flour add the remaining one- fourth cup 
of the cider into which you have stirred and dissolved one 
teaspoon of soda. Beat all together and pour into a well- 
buttered, shallow pan, and bake about a half an hour in a 
moderately hot oven. 

Do not have the oven too hot. Anything with molasses 
in it burns easily, and a quick or hot oven is not the best for 
baking molasses cakes. 

GOLD CAKE 

Cream together a cup of sugar and a scant half of a cup of 
butter. Add to this the yolks of eight eggs whicl\ you have 
beaten stiff, stirring all together thoroughly. Next put in half

and add four eggs, the whites and yolks of which have been 
beaten stifif separately. Put in a grated nutmeg and one 
large cup each of seeded raisins and chopped hickory-nut meats. 
The raisins and nuts should have been dredged in the pound 
of flour which you stir in last and add little by little. Bake 
in a moderate oven.

JAM CAKE 
Mix one cup of sugar with three-fourths of a cup of but- 
ter. Add the yolks and whites of three eggs beaten sepa- 
rately; then a cup of jam and two cups of flour. If you like

dissolved in three teaspoons of sour milk. Bake in small 
layer tins and put the la^^ers together with icing. 

JELLY-CREAM COCOANUT CAKE 
One and a quarter cups of granulated sugar boiled with a 
quarter of a cup of water until it spins a thread. Beat 
seven egg-yolks until lemon color, then pour on to them grad-

ually the hot syrup, beating constantly the eggs, until cold. 
Then, add one cup of pastry flour, a pinch of salt, one tea- 
spoon of lemon extract, and then the whites beaten very stiff. 
Bake in layers. 

JELLY-CREAM 
Place one pint of milk in a basin and set in hot water. When 
hot, add a pinch of salt, two tablespoons of sugar and the yolks 
of three eggs. Cook a few moments ; then stir in one table- 
spoon of gelatine dissolved in a little cold water. Remove 
from hot water; set on ice and stir until it begins to thicken. 
Then add the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs, one teaspoon 
of vanilla and one cup of grated cocoanut. Spread between 
layers and cover top and sides with a boiled icing; then coat 
thoroughly with the cocoanut. [See illustration, Plate XXVL]

with one teaspoon of saleratus or two teaspoons of baking 
powder. Then add the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth and sift in four cups of flour. 

MARGUERITE CAKE 
Cream half a cup of butter, add one and a half cups of 
sugar, and cream again. Then add half a cup of milk, two 
cups of pastry flour sifted with one and a half teaspoons of 
baking powder and one teaspoon of almond extract. Fold in 
the whites of five eggs beaten very stiffly. Bake in a loaf. 
When cool, ice with the following': Beat into the yolk of 
one egg and juice of half a lemon as much confectioners' 
sugar as it will take up; then ice the cake. Trim with mar- 
guerites. [See illustration, Plate XXYIL] 

POTATO CAKE 
Mix one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, and one of cold, 
mashed unseasoned potato. Add half a cup of grated choco- 
late, four eggs, one cup of chopped walnut meats, half a cup 
of milk, and a teaspoon each of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. 
Sift two teaspoons of baking powder with two and a half 
cups of flour and stir all together. Bake the cake in square 
tins.

A plain fruit cake is made by using the foregoing receipt, 
merely doubling the c[uantity of fruit and adding a tablespoon 
of brandy. 

SPONGE CAKE 

Take by exact weight one pound of eggs and one pound 
of sugar. Beat the yolks and sugar to a stiff froth, adding 
the juice of a lemon and its grated rind. Beat the whites of 
the eggs very stiff, add them to the mixture, and then gradu- 
ally, by spoonfuls, add half a pound of flour. Bake in a well- 
heated oven about forty minutes.

jar while baking. 

COLONIAL WEDDING CAKE 

Mix half a pound of sugar and half a pound of butter to 
a cream. Wash a pound and a half of raisins and boil them 
till tender in enough water to make half a pint when cooked. To 
the creamed sugar and butter add the half pint of raisin water, 
two and a half pounds of flour, and half a pint of yeast. 
Beat all together, protect from cold draughts, and set to rise 
during the night. Next morning add half a pound of butter

BROWNIES 

BEAT together till light quarter of a pound of butter, quarter 
of a pound of granulated sugar, and two eggs. Grate the 
yellow off the rind of a lemon and add, stirring in also four 
ounces of grated chocolate, half a cup of milk, and a pinch 
of salt. Next put in a pound of flour which you have sifted 
three or four times. Stir briskly together, roll out and cut 
in brownie or other shapes and bake in a well-warmed oven. 
These little cakes take on a lustre if brushed over with the 
white of an egg. 

CARAMELS 

The homemade caramel too often lacks the chezving 
quality, which to many constitutes its chief charm. To ob- 
tain this quality, confectioners use glucose, a tasteless, color- 
less, and, contrary to popular belief, harmless thick syrup. 
Herewith is given a receipt for making caramels that may be 
chewed. Place one pint of cream, four cups of granulated 
sugar, a half pound of glucose, two ounces of butter, two 
ounces of paraffine, quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar, 
and one cup of shaved chocolate over the fire. Mix thor- 
oughly. Bring slowly to boil, and stir constantly until the 
mixture will harden in ice water. Pour half an inch thick 
into greased pans, and when partly cooled mark with a 
greased knife into squares. Instead of using chocolate, 



316 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

chopped nuts or grated cocoanut may be added just before 
turning into the pans. 

CHOCOLATE feCLAIRS 

Measure half a pint of cold water into a saucepan. Add 
two ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, and a pinch of 
salt. When boiling take from the fire and add five ounces 
of flour and stir till smooth. Put over the fire and stir till 
the paste leaves the sides of the saucepan. Cool, and when 
nearly cold drop in three raw eggs, adding and beating in 
one at a time. With a spoon roll the eclairs about four inches 
in length and about half an inch in diameter, brush them with 
white of egg, and bake in a moderate oven twenty minutes to 
half an hour till golden brown. Cool, split, and fill with 
sweetened whipped cream. Put together and glaze with choc- 
olate made in the following way: Boil half a gill of water 
with one ounce of finely powdered chocolate. When smooth 
stir in eight ounces of icing sugar, and a tablespoon and a 
half of water. Beat all together and glaze each eclair. 

CINNAMON DROPS 

Stir half a pound of brown sugar with two eggs till well 
blended, and add an ounce of powdered cinnamon, quarter 
of a teaspoon of salt, and then flour which you have sifted 
three or four times — enough of the flour to make the dough 
stand. Stir all together thoroughly, and drop from a small 
spoon upon the bottom of a pan which you have dredged with 
flour. Bake a few minutes in a well-heated oven. 

COCOANUT COOKIES 

Blend a cup of sugar and half a cup of butter, one egg, 
and a third of a cup of milk. Add a heaping cup of grated 
cocoanut and a cup and a half of flour into which you have 
sifted two teaspoons of baking powder. Stir together. 
Flour your molding board and roll and cut out a few of the 
cakes at a time, adding only flour enough to make them roll

thin. Bake in a quick oven a light brown and sprinkle with 
gianulated sugar while hot. 

COOKIES 

Mix one cup of butter, or refined beef drippings, with 
two cups of sugar. Add one or two eggs, half a cup of sour 
milk, a teaspoon of dissolved soda, and as much flour as is 
necessary to make a dough to drop off a spoon or roll out 
well. To these cookies a tablespoon of caraway seeds may be 
added with the flour. When cooked they may be sprinkled — 
while hot — with white granulated sugar for a pleasant change 
in looks. 

CREAM CAKES 

Take a cup of boiling water in which is melted one heap- 
ing tablespoon of butter. In this stir eight heaping table- 
spoons of flour and heat over a gentle fire until it is in a 
ball. Let it cool, and when cold add four eggs, putting in one 
at a time and stirring each one in before the next is added. 
Separate in cakes and bake in a hot oven. 

CRULLERS 

Mix into two cups and a half of sugar a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut. Next add three eggs not beaten. Beat 
hard, and stir well to lighten the eggs. Next add a little 
salt and one small* teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water, 
one grated nutmug and extract of lemon, to taste. Stir all 
together and add two small teaspoons of cream of tartar, 
mixed into one cup of flour. Stir again, and add enough flour 
to make the dough stiff enough to roll out easily. Use plenty 
of flour on the board and rolling-pin. Roll about quarter of 
an inch thick. Cut into oblong pieces, score each one in the 
centre, and give it a slight twist after dipping the hand in 
flour. Roll all before beginning to fry, as they stiffen by 
standing and are easier to fry. Fry in a deep porcelain 
or granite kettle (a round bottom is best) and turn often 
while cooking. Use plenty of lard and brown a light brown. 



318 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Lift out with a flat skimmer, and while hot sift over pow- 
dered sugar. When the lard becomes brown, set it aside and 
use fresh lard. Before frying try a small piece of dough in 
the fat to see if it is the right heat. If too hot the calces will 
be too brown. Keep the crullers in a stone pot. 

DAINTY FINGERS 
Beat together half a pound of sugar and half a pound of 
butter. Add five eggs, the whites and yolks of which have 
been beaten separately, one teaspoon of mace, half a wine- 




Lady Finger Pans 

glass of brandy, and half a pound of flour. Stir thoroughly 
together and drop in lady-finger pans for baking to a deli- 
cate brown. When done and while warm fasten the fingers to- 
gether, painting with the white of an egg upon the flat side. 

DOUGHNUTS 
Mix one cup of sugar with butter the size of an egg. Add 
three eggs, half a teaspoon of salt, and one cup of milk. Mix 
two teaspoons of baking powder with the flour you use and 
stir in flour till you have a dough stiflf enough for rolling and 
cutting in shape. Fry in deep, hot lard, and turn often, 

DROP CAKES 
Stir together a cup of sugar and a cup of butter. Instead 
of butter you may use lard or drippings. Dissolve two tea- 
spoons of soda in two tablespoons of cold water, and stir into 
a cup of New Orleans molasses and a cup of sour milk mixed 
together. Add the sugar and butter, a cup of currants lightly 
dredged, and half a teaspoon each of ginger, cinnamon, and 
allspice. Stir in sifted flour until the dough is as stiff as 
fruit cake, and then drop from a spoon upon a greased paper 
laid in a pan. Bake in moderate oven. 



SMALL CAKES 819 

EBONY FINGERS 
Use the receipt for "Coffee Cake," bake in lady-finger pans, 
and put the flat sides of the cakes together with an icing made 
by stirring powdered sugar into orange- juice and beating thor- 
oughly before using. 

FIG ECLAIRS 

Steam one pound of figs over hot water one hour. Then 
chop fine and add a pint and a half of Catawba wine (or less 
of sherry) and half a cup of sugar, and cook until like a 
jelly. Bake yellow or white cake in sheets. Split the sheets 
and spread the fig mixture between. Press together, cut in 
lady-finger size pieces, and ice on three or four sides. 

FRUIT COOKIES 

These ought to be made a week or two before they will 
be eaten, as they are greatly enriched by keeping in a tightly 
covered jar. Cream one cup of butter, gradually add a cup 
and a half of sugar, then when light and creamy add three 
well-beaten eggs and one teaspoon of soda dissolved 
in one and a half tablespoons of hot water. Stir in 
two cups of flour with which has been sifted half a teaspoon 
of salt and one teaspoon of cinnamon. Add one cup of 
coarsely chopped hickorynut meats, half a cup of currants, 
half a cup of raisins seeded and chopped with another cup 
and a quarter of flour. Butter a large baking sheet and drop 
the cookie mixture in small spoonfuls one inch apart. Bake 
in a moderate oven. 

FRUIT JUMBLES 

Blend one cup of sugar with a third of a cup of butter. 
Add two eggs, half a cup of milk, and one and two-thirds of 
a cup of flour into which one teaspoon of baking powder has 
been sifted. Stir in a cup of lightly dredged raisins, spread 
thin in buttered pans and bake in a quick oven. Cut in squares 
while hot. 



820 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

GINGER COOKIES 

Mix together one teacup of dark brown sugar, one teacup 
of lard and butter mixed (more butter than lard), add one 
egg not beaten. Beat and stir hard to lighten the egg. Add 
one teacup of New Orleans molasses, two even teaspoons 
of soda dissolved in cold water, one tablespoon of vinegar, a 
little salt, one tablespoon of ginger, two teaspoons of cinna- 
mon, three-quarters of a teaspoon of cloves, three-quarters of 
a teaspoon of allspice, and four teacups and a half of flour. 
Flour the board and rolling-pin well to prevent sticking. 
Roll thick or thin, as you like. Bake quickly if you do not 
want the cookies hard. Use a greased pan in baking. 

HERMITS 

Blend a :cup and a half of dark-brown sugar with half a 
cup of butter, and afterward add three well-beaten eggs. Next 
put in half a nutmeg grated, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a 
cup of raisins, seeded, chopped, and dredged. Add a teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in hot water and flour enough to make the 
dough roll out in a soft blanket. Cut with cookie cutters into 
any shape you please — animals, letters, or geometrical de- 
signs. Bake in a moderate oven. 

IMPROVE-WITH-AGE CAKES 

Mix half a cup of butter and half a cup of lard with one 
and a half cups of sugar. Put in three eggs beaten together, 
salt, cinnamon, and cloves to taste, half a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in a tablespoon of warm water, and two and a half 
cups of flour. Add a pound of English walnut meats, a 
pound of stoned dates, and a cup and a half of seeded rasins — 
all the fruit having been chopped medium fine. Stir well 
together, drop from a spoon on tins and bake in a medium 
hot oven. Keep the cakes in a stone jar in a cool, dry place, 
and thev are better after a little time than at first. 



SMALL CAKES 321 

JUMBLES 

Cream together one heaping teacup of shortening (three- 
quarters of which should be butter, the rest lard) and two 
even teacups of sugar. To this add five well-beaten eggs. 
Mix thoroughly. Next put in one teacup of sweet milk, half 
a teaspoon of salt, half a nutmeg, the grated rind of a lemon, 
and two tablespoons of lemon extract. Beat well together. 
Stir in four teacups of sifted flour. This done, knead in two 
more teacups of flour. Roll out on the pastry board not 
quite a quarter of an inch thick, cut with a small biscuit cut- 
ter, and bake in a floured pan. With a feather or a very small 
brush dust the top of each one lightly with the white of an 
egg not beaten, and sift over them (with a small tea strainer) 
granulated sugar. Bake in a quick oven a very light brown. 

MACAROONS 

Home-made macaroons cost much less than when bought 
in a bakery — then you know they are fresh. On a large plat- 
ter put three-eighths of a pound of powdered sugar (sifted), 
half a pound of almond paste and add gradually the whites 
of three eggs slightly beaten. With the hands work this mix- 
ture into a perfectly smooth paste. Line a large baking pan 
with buttered paper and drop the paste from a teaspoon in tiny 
balls half an inch apart. The macaroon mixture slightly 
spreads in baking. They require from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes in a slow oven. After baking, turn the paper to which 
the macaroons stick upside down, wet it with a cloth wrung 
from cold water, and they will come oflf easily, 

MAPLE SUGAR COOKIES 

Mix a cup of butter with three cups of maple sugar. Add 
two beaten eggs, a cup of sour milk, and then stir in flour 
and one teaspoon of dissolved soda. Make the dough stiff 
enough to separate in lumps off a spoon, roll out and bake. 



322 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

MOLASSES COOKIES 
Have half a cup of lard or butter and till up the cup with 
cold water. Mix with two cups of molasses and one table- 
spoon each of salt, vinegar, and ginger. Stir in flour and add 
two teaspoons of soda dissolved in two tablespoons of hot 
water. Put in enough flour to roll the dough in a soft blanket, 
cut in shapes and bake in a slow oven. 

NEW YORK NEW YEAR'S CAKES 
Cream together a pound of sugar and a pound of butter 
and then add a small cup of milk. Gradually stir in three 
pounds of flour into which three heaping teaspoons of baking 
powder have been sifted, and then add three tablespoons of 
caraway seeds. Roll out the dough in sheets half an inch 
thick, and cut into cakes about four inches long and two inches 
broad. Prick the top with a fork, lay in greased pans, and 
bake a light brown. 

NOAH'S ARK COOKIES 
Take a cup of butter, or of butter and drippings mixed, 
and cream it with two cups of sugar. A couple of table- 
spoons of cream may also be added with good effect. Work 
in also the beaten yolks of four eggs, and then stir in, using 
first a little of the flour and a little of the whites, four cups 
of flour and the whites of four eggs beaten to a froth. Be- 
fore using the flour sift into it four teaspoons of baking 
powder. Grate over the dough quarter of a nutmeg, roll out 
thin, and with the little tin cutters, made after various shapes 
of birds and beasts, cut out the cookies. Bake in a hot oven. 
The cookies may be glazed by brushing with white of an egg 
and then set back in the oven for a moment. Or white or 
colored sugars may be sifted over them for a child's birth- 
day party. But for the child's common use serve them plain. 

OATIMEAL CAKES 
Stir one cup of butter in one cup of sugar and add a 
beaten egg and a teaspoon of salt. Stir in gradually two cups 



SMALL CAKES 323 

of white flour and two cups of oatmeal, adding also a teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in two tablespoons of milk. When you have 
the dough well mixed roll it thin, cut into shapes and bake 
in a moderate oven. 

LITTLE SNOW CAKES 

Little snow cakes are made from plain snow-cake batter 
baked in patty pans. See directions for "Snow Cake" on page 
312. When the cakes are cool, dip each one in an icing flavored 
with orange extract and slightly colored by adding some of 
the grated rind of a fine yellow orange. 

SNOW AND CHOCOLATE BALLS 

Cut a large sponge cake into balls about an inch and a half 
in diameter. Half of the balls dip in chocolate icing, and the 
other half dip in white icing and then in grated cocoanut. 
Dry the icings and then pile together for serving. 

WALNUT SMALL CAKES 

Stir together one cup of butter and one cup and a half of 
sugar. Then stir in three eggs and two cups of chopped 
walnut meats which have been dredged with flour. Lastly 
add a cup and a half of flour into which a heaping teaspoon 
of baking powder has been sifted. Stir together, and from the 
spoon drop the dough upon buttered paper laid in tins, allow- 
ing room for the cakes to run as they heat.

FRENCH BONBONS 

BEFORE attempting this variety of sweets, it is imperative 
that one master the art of making fondant, which is the 
basis of all French candies. With this knowledge, the possible 
changes and combinations are almost limitless ; without it, 
nothing can be done. 

There are two popular ways of making fondant; but as 
both produce, practically, the same results, which shall be used 
is a matter of choice. 

RAW FONDANT 

To the white of one egg add an equal quantity of ice water 
(this may be exactly ascertained if the white of egg is first 
measured in a glass) and a teaspoon of extract. Beat until 
the mixture is light, then add, gradually, one pound or more 
confectioner's XXX sugar. Work with a spoon until smooth 
and firm. 

COOKED FONDANT 

Place over the fire four cups of XXX sugar and one cup 
of water; stir with a wooden spatula until the sugar is dis- 
solved, no longer. Boil ten minutes, or until it "threads." 
Remove the saucepan to the table and test the fondant by 
rubbing a little of it between the fingers. If it balls, turn into a 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 325 

bowl. When partly cooled, add flavoring, then beat with the 
spatula until stiff enough to knead with the hands like bread. 

The fondant resulting from either of these mixtures may 
be shaped into balls, squares, small cubes, disks, and many 
other forms. A little experience will enable one to do this 
readily. If vegetable colorings — which are harmless — be 
used, the French candies may be more perfectly imitated. For 
flavoring, use extracts or fruit juices. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS 

Dip plain creams, shaped from fondant, into melted sweet 
chocolate and they become chocolate creams. This dipping 
must be done quickly. Nothing is better for holding the 
creams while dipping than a long hatpin. Harden on oiled 
paper. 

COCOANUT CREAMS 

Add grated cocoanut to the fondant, shape into cones, 
brush over with beaten white of egg and roll gently in grated 
cocoanut. 

FRUIT BONBONS 

Stone candied cherries, white grapes, or dates and fill 
with small rolls of fondant flavored with vanilla. 

FRUIT CREAMS 

Add chopped fruit to the fondant and shape to suit the 
fancy. Or form into a loaf and cut into small square slices. 
By substituting chopped nuts for the fruit one has delicious 
nut loaf. 

NUT CREAMS 

Pecan, peanut, almond, hazelnut, or English walnut meats 
are converted into nut creams by rolling them in fondant and 
then dipping in melted chocolate. Or press the meats into 
little cakes of the fondant. 

Thus one combination suggests another equally delicious, 
and from even a small amount of fondant a great variety of 



326 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

bonbons may be evolved. It is wiser to make the fondant 
in small quantities. If more is needed, make again. The 
results w^arrant this expenditure of time and trouble. 

VARIEGATED CREAMS 

Divide the fondant into three or more parts. Color and 
flavor each differently. Mold into flat cakes, pile one upon 
the other, press firmly but carefully together, trim the edges 
neatly, then cut into squares, cubes, or strips. 

BUTTER SCOTCH 

To four tablespoons of sugar and six tablespoons of mo- 
lasses add two tablespoons of water and four tablespoons of 
butter. Melt all together slowly and cook slowly, stirring 
often, till it hardens when dropped in cold water. 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS 

Boil together three cups of sugar, one cup of milk, one- 
fourth of a cake of Baker's chocolate, and butter the size 
of an egg. Have care about your fire. This dish will burn 
easily, and the fire must be moderate and the mixture well 
w^atched in the cooking. Drop a spoonful in water to test; 
if it hardens it is do»e. Pour in buttered pans and cool. 

CHOCOLATE PUFFS 

Beat stifif the whites of two eggs, and then beat in half a 
pound of powdered .sugar. Scrape fine an ounce and a half 
of chocolate and dredge it with flour. Add gradually to the 
eggs and sugar, and beat all together hard. Upon the bottom 
of baking pan lay a sheet of paper, and upon the paper lay 
powdered sugar in spots about as big as a silver half dollar. 
Upon these powdered sugar spots pile the chocolate mixture, 
smooth with a wet knife dipped in cold water, sift over a 
little sugar, and bake in a hot oven a few minutes. Cool and 
loosen from the paper with a thin knife. 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 327 

COCOANUT KISSES 

Beat the white of an egg and add half a cup of sugar. 
Stir constantly until it will not drop from a spoon. Add three 
tablespoons of grated cocoanut. Drop on buttered paper and 
bake lightly. 

COUGH CANDY 

In one dish put a gill of whole flaxseed and pour over it 
half a pint of boiling water. In another dish put a cup of 
slippery elm broken in small bits and cover it with boiling 
water. Let both stand and macerate two or three hours. 
Then put them in a cheesecloth and strain by squeezing into 
an earthenware saucepan. Add a pound and a half of sugar 
and boil slowly fifteen minutes. Then add the juice of two 
lemons. Cook till it candies easily, pour on buttered paper or 
plates and cool. 

CREAM CANDIES OF DIFFERENT SORTS 

Melt four cups of granulated sugar in a cup of cream and 
boil together five to seven minutes. Set the saucepan in cold 
water, put in a teaspoon of vanilla, and stir the cream till it 
is hard enough to make into balls. 

To make chocolate creams, dip the balls in melted chocolate. 

To make walnut creams, press into two sides of a small 
ball 'two perfect half meats of the walnut. 

To make date creams, press into two sides of a small ball 
the halves of dates freed from the stone. 

FUDGES 

Measure two cups of granulated sugar and one cup of 
milk. Set this on the fire to heat. After it is warm, add a 
piece of butter the size of an egg and three heaping table- 
spoons of grated chocolate. Boil twenty minutes. To judge 
whether it is done, drop a little into ice water, and if it 
stiffens, remove from the fire, and add a teaspoon of vanilla 
and beat until almost cold. Have ready buttered pans. Pour 



328 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the mixture into them, and mark tliem off in squares. Set 
away to cool. 

MAPLE FUDGE 

Take a cup and a half of maple sugar broken into very 
small pieces and half a cup of granulated sugar. Add a cup 
of milk, set over the fire, and add two heaping tablespoons of 
coarsely grated or scraped unsweetened chocolate and a table- 
spoon of butter. Boil all together carefully for half an hour. 
To test if it is done put a little in a saucer ; if it hardens, it is 
done. Take from the fire, stir in a teaspoon of vanilla and 
a cup of walnut meats, keep on stirring till the fudge begins 
to stiffen, and then pour into shallow buttered tins. Mark 
off in squares and set in a cool place to chill. 

MOLASSES CANDY WITH NUTS 

Put one tablespoon of butter, two tablespoons of water, 
and one cup of sugar in a kettle. Stir and watch when the 
mixture boils. Then add half a cup of molasses of the best 
sort — not the adulterated which floods the market, but pure 
New Orleans molasses if you can get it. Boil fifteen minutes, 
watching carefully, and then test. If the mixture candies in 
cold water, it is done. Have on the bottom of buttered tins 
rows of hickory-nuts or other meats you have picked out while 
the syrup is boiling. Pour the syrup over the meats and cool. 

NOUGAT 

To make this most delectable of candies, melt over the fire 
in a porcelain-lined vessel one pound of fine white sugar 
with two tablespoons of water. Have ready a half pound of 
sweet almonds, blanched and chopped. When the syrup be- 
gins to turn yellow, add the nuts, stir for five minutes, add a 
little grated lemon-peel, and pour at once into a well-oiled flat 
pan. When partly cooled, mark with a greased knife into 
bars. 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 829 

PEANUT CANDY 

Melt slowly in a saucepan a pound of heavy wet brown 
sugar — add no water. Shell a quart of fresh roasted peanuts 
and chop them a little. When the sugar is cooked to a thick 
syrup, shake a little salt over the peanuts and stir them in. 
Pour in shallow buttered tins and cool. 

PRALINES 

The fame of these delicious sweetmeats has come north 
from New Orleans, where you find them sold on the streets. 
Boil together two scant cups of powdered sugar, one cup of 
maple syrup, and half a cup of thick cream. When this 
mixture can be dipped into cold water and forms a soft ball 
it is ready to take from the fire. Beat it till smooth and 
creamy, then stir in two cups of broken pecan meats and drop 
from a teaspoon in small piles upon paraffine paper. 

POPCORN WAFERS 

Make a receipt of boiled icing. Stir in fresh popcorn 
that has been buttered and salted. Have long wafers. Pile 
on the corn till it is nearly an inch thick ; set in the oven and 
brown to a light color. 

CHESTNUTS CANDIED OR MARRONS GLACES 

Parboil eighteen or twenty large French chestnuts till the 
skins rub off easily. Then put in hot water and simmer till 
tender. Dissolve a cup of sugar in a cup of water, and add 
the tender chestnuts. Move them carefully so they will not 
break. Let them cook in the hot syrup till clear, then take 
them out. Next boil the syrup till it hardens on being 
dropped in cold water, take from the fire, and add half a 
dozen drops of lemon-juice. Put in the chestnuts, turn 
them about till they are coated with the syrup and drain on 
oiled paper. 



880 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

STUFFED DATES 

Purchase the finest dates for this sweetmeat, and after 
separating them wipe each one careful!)' with a bit of damp 
cheesecloth. Make a cut the entire length of a date and re- 
move the stone. Fill the cavity with a blanched almond or an 
English walnut. Sprinkle the palms of the hands with pow- 
dered sugar and roll the date to its original form. Leave 
the dates in powdered sugar until ready to serve. 

FRUIT CANDY 

Cut half a pound of figs in small pieces, add a tablespoon 
of grated chocolate and two pounds of sugar and enough water 
to dissolve the sugar. Cook all together till it creams, and 
then add, after taking from the fire, three-quarters of a pound 
of seeded dates and the meats of a pound and a half of En- 
glish walnuts. Stir all together till grains appear, and then 
spread in oiled pans and set to cool. Cut in squares when cold. 

CANDIED ORANGE RINDS 

Orange rinds left from breakfast you may convert into 
a dainty confection. Cut them in strips, carefully removing 
the bitter white part. Boil them in hot water till quite tender. 
To a cup of sugar add four tablespoons of water, cook to the 
crackling point and drop in the orange strips and cook five 
minutes longer. Set away to cool, leaving the rinds in the 
syrup. When cool drain the rinds on a sieve, dip in granu- 
lated sugar, and dry on oiled paper. 

SALTED NUTS 

Almost any large-meated nuts — pecans, almonds, filberts, 
peanuts, or English walnuts — may be salted. Buy pecans and 
walnuts shelled, as it is very difficult to remove them from the 
shells entire. A pound of shelled walnuts at forty cents a 
pound is really cheaper than when unshelledvat twenty cents. 
Peanuts and almonds are more economical purchased un- 



/ 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 331 

shelled. Obtain peanuts that are unroasted. Remove the 
skins by pouring boiUng water over them — a process which is 
called blanching — then dry thoroughly. For a pound of nuts 
pour half a cup of olive oil in a spider. When hot, put in one 
cup of the nuts and shake gently over a brisk fire till they 
begin to brown delicately. When all are evenly browned, lift 
the nuts on a skimmer, drain as much oil from them as possible 
and toss on a sheet of white blotting paper. Dust liberally with 
fine salt. Do not salt nuts longer than twenty-four hours 
before they are eaten.

THE ART OF PIE-MAKING 

ALTHOUGH many esteemed authorities on dietetics have 
placed their ban of displeasure upon the pie-eating habit, 
declaring it to be at all times conducive to ill health, yet the 
fact remains that in many homes pies are freely consumed. 

It is not the purpose of this article either to extol or to con- 
done the consumption of pastry, but to give explicit directions 
for making the very best quality of this, if questionable, 
nevertheless delectable, variety of sweets. To make crisp, 
palatable pastry the work must be done in a cool place, the 
materials which enter into its composition must be of the best, 
thoroughly chilled, put together quickly, with as little contact 
during the whole process with the hands and fingers as is prac- 
ticable. All hard kneading must be avoided if light paste is 
desired. 

The best paste is obtained by using equal portions of butter 
and lard for shortening. When butter alone is used, except 
for puff paste, the crust will be tough. All lard produces ten- 
der paste, but it is white and tasteless. When freshly made 
butter can not be had, wash the butter thoroughly and knead 
in several successive waters. 

To mix properly the dough for pastry, first sift the salt — 
of which very little shoulci be used— with the flour, then by 
means of a knife cut the shortening into the flour. To one 



PIES AND PASTRIES 333 

accustomed to use the hands for this purpose the operation 
will be awkward ; but experience will overcome this, and the 
result justifies the extra trouble. 

When the flour and shortening are incorporated, add, a 
few drops at a time, just enough ice water or very cold water 
to cause the ingredients to adhere, being careful to avoid hav- 
ing wet streaks. Do not knead, but turn the dough, which has 
been lightly gathered into a round heap, on to a well-floured 
doughboard, or marble slab if procurable, and divide into two 
parts, one for the upper, the other for the lower crust. 

Flour the rolling-pin, which should be straight — that is, the 
same size at the ends as in the middle — then, with light but 
effectual strokes, roll into shape. The strokes must always 
be fro7n the worker, and the pressure must be even. The top 
'crust must have airholes in it, else it will burst. 

The paste will be lighter if, after mixing, it is stood in the 
ice-box or other cold place for two hours or more before 
baking. 

One of the banes of the pie-maker is the soggy under crust. 
To prevent this, bake, but do not brown, the bottom crust 
before putting in the filling. Further, upon removing from the 
oven do not take out of the baking tin until ready to serve. In- 
stead, stand on an inverted teacup. The air will circulate be- 
neath and dry the under crust. A trial of this method will 
convince the sceptical. Perforated pie-tins are the most satis- 
factory. If these can not be had use granite ware. 

Perhaps, after all, the success of the pie depends more upon 
the baking than upon any other step in the whole process. The 
materials may be the choicest and skilfully combined, yet if the 
oven be too slow the paste will not rise, but become white and 
clammy. In this many cooks may find an answer to the puzzle, 
why their pies never look fresh and flaky. On the other hand, 
if the heat be too brisk and the paste browns before it has time 
to rise, it will have a rancid taste. 

It will, therefore, be seen that the temperature of the oven 
is a matter of much moment to the successful pastry cook. 
The fire should be made long enough beforehand for the 



334 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

heat to have a "body." Test before putting hi the pies by 
baking a bit of crust. 

A good formula for proportions for family pastry is : To 
three cups of sifted flour, to which a Httle salt is added, use 
one cup of shortening. If half a teaspoon of baking powder 
is .used three-fourths of a cup of shortening will suffice. This 
is sufficient for four ordinary pies. The amount may be in- 
creased or diminished provided the proportions are kept. 

PIECRUST 

Before making your piecrust, put some lard into a bowl, 
on this lay a good-sized piece of ice and cover with water. 
Set on the ice, or in some very cold place, for twenty min- 
utes or half an hour. At the end of that time put into a pan 
a slightly heaping teaspoon of salt and one small pint cup 
of sifted flour. To this add two heaping tablespoons of the 
lard you have in the ice water. Cut this lard through the 
flour with a knife, or mix quickly with the tips of the fingers. 
Pour over enough of the ice water to roll easily (which you 
can ascertain by pressing your finger on the pastry), mix with 
a spoon, turning over and over until all is mixed. Then 
sprinkle the pan you have mixed it in with flour, lay your 
paste back in it, and set on the ice, or in some very cold place, 
twenty minutes. Have your pie-plate ready, grease very 
lightly, then sprinkle flour over it. Then sprinkle flour rather 
thickly on the pastry board, flour the rolling-pin, cut a piece 
of dough and lay on the board. Sprinkle flour over the dough, 
give it one roll out flat, beat it once, fold over the four cor- 
ners, sprinkle with flour and roll again quite thin. Double 
the piece you have rolled just in the middle, lay it double on 
the pie-plate, then turn the folded half back, fit it to the pie- 
plate, giving plenty of room for it to fall into place. Trim 
the edges with a knife that has been dipped into the flour. 
Put the fruit on the pastry. Now roll the upper crust in the 
same way. Fold, flour, roll, and beat twice. Roll the upper 
crust thicker than the under [crust. Double it exactly half over 



PIES AND PASTRIES 335 

and cut several gashes in the centre. Lay this in the same 
position on the pie, turn over the upper half, giving room 
for it to fit, and trim the edge as before. Handle the pie- 
crust as little as possible, as the heat of the hand will make 
it heavy. In rolling, roll from you — and roll only one way. 
The baking is the most important. Heat the oven hot. Judge 
of the heat by trying a small piece of the dough. If the 
crust is baking too fast, set a pan of cold water in the upper 
oven to cool it at once. Turn the pie around two or three 
times that it may bake evenly. When done, and perfectly 
cold, sprinkle powdered sugar over the upper crust. The 
quantity directed will make one large pie. 

PUFF PASTE 

To make pufif paste that is light and flaky requires, be- 
sides the knowledge hozv, an infinite amount of patience and 
a certain adroitness or, one might say, sleight of hand, which 
only comes with experience. 

The secret lies in securing the greatest number of alter- 
nate layers of butter and dough. To accomplish this there 
must be sufficient butter to form these layers before it is ab- 
sorbed into the dough. If too much butter is used it will 
not be absorbed ; consequently the paste will be heavy, greasy, 
and unpalatable- 
Many cooks allow equal weights of flour and butter for 
puff paste. Experience has proved that equally good results 
may be had by using three-fourths of a pound of butter to 
one pound of flour. The butter, which must be fresh and 
sweet, should harden in ice water before it is used, and then 
be divided into four equal parts. 

Sift the flour into a bowl which has been thoroughly 
chilled, cut up one of the lumps of butter in it, then wet with 
a little ice water. When a dough is thus formed, turn upon 
a marble slab, dust with flour and roll into a strip about twelve 
by six inches. Flour the remaining portions of butter and 
roll into strips eight by five inches. Mix half a teaspoon of 



336 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

cream of tartar with twice its bulk of flour. Sprinkle each 
strip of butter with the mixture, lay one on the strip of 
dough and roll up. Let stand fifteen minutes in a cold place 
to prevent the butter from oiling, then roll out, lay on an- 
other butter strip, roll up, set aside to chill, and so proceed 
until all the butter is incorporated with the dough ; then roll 
into shape. 

This variety of paste is especially suitable for tarts and 
pies having no top crust. In summer, it should be made the 
day before baking, then put into a closely covered pail and 
stood in the ice-chest. 

PREPARING FRUITS FOR PIE 

Apples should be peeled, sliced thin and sugared to taste 
before being put in the piecrust. Peaches should also be 
peeled and sugared. But if the peaches are small they may 
be cooked in the pie with their pits, which give an added flavor. 
Raspberries, blackberries, cherries, currants should be dusted 
with flour as well as sweetened before being put in the 
crust. Gooseberries and cranberries should be stewed and 
sweetened before being put in their piecrust. 

To all these fruits a tablespoon or two of cold water 
should be added. In the fruit pies use fruit generously. 
That is, have plenty of the fruit filling, w^iich wholesomely 
serves as an antidote to the rich pastry. 

^ APPLE PIE 

Peel and slice good flavored tart apples. Judge of the 
quantity you will need by slicing them into the pie plate you 
will use, heaping them to allow for loss in cooking. After 
slicing rinse quickly in cold water, put in a saucepan with a 
little water and two tablespoons or more of sugar. Cook 
until the apples are a little tender. Take them off, put the 
apples on the lower crust, and whatever juice is required. 
Then put on the upper crust, and bake. When done, take 
out the pie and with a broad-bladed knife loosen the upper 



PIES AND PASTRIES 337 

crust, and lay over entirely on to the table. Put into the pie 
a tablespoon of butter, and sugar to taste, and gently mix 
the ingredients through the apple with a silver knife. Nut- 
meg may be added if liked, but no other spice. Be careful 
not to touch or break the under crust. Return the cover 
to the pie, and when cold and ready for use sift powdered 
sugar over the top crust. If you serve the pie hot, pour cream 
over it; or serve it plain. 

CHERRY PIE 
Have sour, ripe cherries pitted. Pits may be left in a 
few to give their flavor. Prepare your crust on the pie 
plate, pinching the edge up high. Then lay in very gen- 



Cherry Fitter 

erously the cherries, putting in first a layer of the fruit and 
then sugar till you use a cupful. Over the top sprinkle a 
tablespoon of flour and lay on the upper crust. Pinch it 
down well round the edges, for cherries are juicy, and the 
juice boils over. Cut the upper crust in the middle to give 
vent to steam, and bake in a hot oven. 

CREAM PIE 

Blend a cup of sugar with one pint of cream. Stir in the 
beaten whites of tour eggs and a quarter of a nutmeg grated- 
This pie should have but a lower crust.

SOUR CREAM PIE 

Beat one egg into a cup of sour cre^m. Add one cup of 
chopped and seeded raisins, and bake between two crusts. 

DRIED FRUIT PIES 

Dried peaches, apricots, prunes, cherries, apples, and 
other fruits are used for pies. In getting the dried fruit 
ready, wash quickly in warm water three times. Then cover 
the fruit wath fresh cold water and let it stand and soak over- 
night. Next morning stew in the water in which it soaked 
till tender. Then sweeten and spice to taste, and lay upon 
the piecrust. A tablespoon of butter spread over the fruit 
improves its flavor. Dried fruit pies are commonly baked 
with an upper crust. Sometimes they are without an upper 
crust and are covered with a meringue — which is made by 
beating to a froth the whites of two eggs, adding and beat- 
ing in two tablespoons of sugar, and setting in a moderate 
oven to brown after it is spread over the pie. 

LEMON PIE— DOUBLE CRUST 

Grate the rind and take out the pulp of one lemon and 
extract the seeds. Carefully chop the pulp fine in a granite 
pan, as a wooden chopping bowl would absorb the juice. 
Add the juice to the chopped lemon. Mix in a saucepan 
one teacup of sugar, one teacup of water, and one tablespoon 
of flour dissolved in water, and stirred smooth. Set the 
saucepan In another of hot water, and stir constantly until 
the mixture boils, stirring until it thickens. Then take off 
and pour over the lemon. Stir all together, and when cool 
add one beaten egg. Bake in a deep pie plate, with both an 
upper and under crust. This will make one pie. 

LEMON PIE— UNDER CRUST 

From two large lemons grate the rind and squeeze the 
juice. Blend with the juice the yolks of four eggs, three 



PIES AND PASTRIES 339 

cups of sugar, five tablespoons of flour or cornstarch, and 

two cups of water. Add the grated rinds and stir in the 

beaten whites just as you pour into the crust. Bake with only 
an under crust. 

LEMON MERINGUE PIE 

Stir one heaping teaspoon of flour into one cup of sugar. 
Into the yolks of three eggs stir the juice and grated yellow 
of a lemon. Mix the lemon and sugar parts and add half a 
cup of cold water. Put in the crust and bake, and when 
baked cover with a meringue made of the whites of the eggs 
beaten with a little sugar. After putting on the meringue 
let the pie stand a few moments in a moderate oven. 

CHOCOLATE LEMON PIE 

Bake two crusts. Into one put a rich lemon filling. Next 
put on the other crust, right side up, and fill with a mixture 
made by cooking until thick and creamy one and one-half 
cups of powdered sugar, five tablespoons of grated chocolate, 
and vanilla extract to flavor. Cover with white and chocolate 
meringue. [See illustration, Plate XXVII. ] 

MINCEMEAT 

Boil until tender a fresh beef tongue of good size. For 
this mincemeat use half of it. The half you use free from 
skin and chop very fine. Also chop fine a pound and a half 
of fresh beef suet and a pound and a half of good tart baking 
apples. To these ingredients add two pounds of currants 
washed clean and dried, half a pound of raisins seeded, half 
a pound of sugar, quarter of an ounce of mace, quarter of 
an ounce of grated nutmeg, an eighth of an ounce each of 
cinnamon and cloves, and half a pint of brandy. When you 
put this meat in the crust lay on top of it before putting on 
the upper crust little pieces of candied citron and orange. 



3i0 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

ORANGE PIE 

Grate two good-sized oranges, yellow, pulp, all except the 
leathery centre skin. Add to them a cup of sugar, the 
yolks of three eggs, and three tablespoons of thick cream. 
Bake with only one crust. Make a meringue of the whites 
of the eggs beaten stiff with a little sugar, spread over the 
fire and set in a moderate oven for a few minutes. 

POTATO PIE 

Rub through a colander one pound of potatoes. Let the 
hot potato fall from the colander on quarter of a pound of 
butter. Mix and add one pound of sugar beaten together 
with the yolks of six eggs. Stir this into the potato, and 
add the grated rind and juice of one lemon. Last stir lightly 
through the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Line 
two deep pieplates with the piecrust, pour in the filling and 
bake. 

PUMPKIN PIE 

To prepare the pumpkin peel and cut it in pieces about 
an inch square. Pour into a granite or porcelain kettle 
one pint of cold water. Add the pumpkin and cook slowly 
for five hours, to allow^ some of the water to cook away. 
Have ready a crock, set a colander over it and pour in the 
pumpkin. Let this drain off overnight. Next day press the 
pumpkin through the colander with a potato masher. It 
takes half a large pumpkin to prepare this. For the pies 
take three cups and a half of pumpkin, one full teaspoon of 
salt, three beaten eggs, two even teaspoons of ginger, half 
of a grated nutmeg, one iron spoon of molasses, one heaping 
tablespoon of butter, one cup of milk, and half a cup of 
cream. In preparing pumpkin for a pie, the quantity of milk 
needed will vary according to the quality of the pumpkin. 
A good pumpkin will thicken as the milk is added. A poor 
one will be thinner, and so much milk can not be used. The 
receipt here given is for a good pumpkin. It is always well 



PIES AND PASTRIES 341 

in any case to make the mixture for the pie thick. This 
given quantity will make two pies. Line a pieplate with pie- 
crust, trim off the edge with a knife dipped in flour. Pour 
in the mixture full to the top. Bake in a moderately hot 
oven, and slowly, as pumpkin pies need to be very well done. 
If the pastry is baking too brown, set a pan of warm water 
over the pie in the upper oven, 

PHILADELPHIA PUMPKIN PIES 

To one pint of stewed pumpkin which you have mashed 
through the sieve or colander add two pints of cream, the 
beaten yolks of twelve eggs, and two grated nutmegs. Add 
also one teaspoon of mixed powdered spices, two cups of 
sugar, the juice of two lemons, and the whites of eggs 
beaten to a froth. 

This is for Thanksgiving and Christmas pies. 

RAISIN PIE 

Stem and cleanse a pound of raisins and let them simmer 
one hour in water enough to cover them. Take from the 
fire, cool and stone. Add the grated rind and juice of one 
lemon, a cup of sugar, two tablespoons of flour dissolved in 
a little of the raisin water, and the rest of the raisin water. 
These pies have an upper and under crust. 

RHUBARB OR PIEPLANT PIE 

Unless you have stalks young and exceedingly tender, 
begin by stripping off the skins of the stalks. Then cut the 
stalks in pieces half an inch long. Cover a pie tin with crust, 
pinching the edge up high. Strew over it thick pieces of 
pieplant mixed with sugar, allowing to a cup of the rhubarb 
a cup of sugar. Sprinkle over all a tablespoon of flour and 
add a tablespoon of cold water. Lay on the upper crust 
after you have cut centre vent holes, pinch down well to keep 
the juice in, and bake in a well-heated oven about half an 
hour. 



342 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

RHUBARB MERINGUE PIE 

Cut rhubarb into thin sHces ; measure a coffee cup heap- 
ing full. Beat the yolks of two eggs with half a cup of sugar, 
one tablespoon of flour, and one-fourth of a cup of water. 
Mix with the rhubarb. Turn into a pastry-lined pie tin and 
bake in a moderate oven until the crust is done and filling 
well set. Beat the whites of the eggs until stiff, add two 
tablespoons of .pulverized sugar and beat again. Heap 
roughly over the top of the pie while hot. Set back in the 
oven to brown delicately. Serve cold. 

GREEN TOMATO PIE 

Slice green tomatoes, put in an earthen saucepan, and 
sweeten with equal quantities of sugar and New Orleans 
molasses, and no water. Cook over moderate heat until the 
tomatoes are clear. Line a pie plate with paste, lay the to- 
matoes in it, and cover them with the syrup. Cut two slices 
of lemon in small pieces, and mix in with the tomatoes. 
Sprinkle flour thickly over the top. Put a rather thick crust 
over and bake. When the pie is cold sprinkle over with 
powdered sugar. 

ALMOND STRAWS OR TARTS 

Sift together and thoroughly mix one pound of pastry 
flour, one teaspoon of salt, and one teaspoon of baking powder. 
Blanch and pulverize half a pound of almonds. Mix the 
almonds with the flour ingredients and work in half a cup of 
shortening made half of butter and half of lard. Mix with 
ice water as in making common pastry, cut in the shapes you 
wish, and bake in a hot oven. 

CHEESE BISCUIT 

Roll puff paste thin and grate a fine American cheese upon 
it until it is thickly covered. Over the cheese dash cayenne. 
Fold the paste on itself and roll out thin. Cut in the form 



PIES AND PASTRIES 343 

you wish, brush with a brush dipped in the beaten white of 
an egg, and bake a hght brown in a quick oven. 

CHEESE STRAWS 
Mix together with your hand half a pound of flour, five 
ounces of butter, five ounces of grated American cheese, two 
eggs, a pinch of mustard, and salt and pepper to your taste. 
When you have this in a smooth dough, lay it on your pastry 
board and roll it out thin, have it say a fifth or a sixth of an 
inch thick. Cut it in straws four or five inches long, and 
bake on tin plates in a quick oven till a golden brown. 

CREAM HORNS 
Roll out puff paste until it is very thin. Then cut it in 
long strips and wind it round floured irons or sticks, which 
must be round. Wind the paste so that its edges will meet. 
Or if you prefer wrap it so that it will have a corkscrew 
form. Bake until thoroughly done, and when the paste is 
cold slip it from the forms. Fill in with flavored whipped 
cream, or with preserves or jellies. To glaze the horns brush 
with the white of an egg, dust with sugar, and set in the 
oven till the glaze forms. [See illustration, Plate XXYHL] 

FIG TARTS 

Put one pint of figs in a pint of hot water and let them 
gently stew almost three hours and a half. Use an earthen- 
ware or porcelain-lined saucepan. If the water boils out 
add enough hot to keep the figs stewing. When nearly 
cooked add a cup of sugar, and when you take from the stove 
add the juice of a good-sized lemon. Have ready some tiny 
shells of puff paste and into these drop the figs. If you wish 
to cap the figs with whipped cream, drop a spoonful on each 
fig filling. But the tarts will be rich enough without the 
cream. 

PASTRY FRUIT CAKES 

Roll pastry scraps left from making pies or puffs into a 
thin sheet and spread thick with chopped dates, raisins, nuts. 



344 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

figs, or any such fruits you have at hand. Lay another thin 
sheet of the pastry over the filHng, press Hghtly, cut into 
shapes with a biscuit or sandwich cutter, and bake till a golden 
brown. 

PUFF PASTE PATTIES 

[See Illustration, Plate XXVIII.] 

Wash half a pound of butter in a bowl of ice water till 
it becomes elastic and creamy. Put it into a long strip and 
lay it on ice- Sift half a pound of flour three times, adding 
half a teaspoon of salt, and then add gradually half a cup 
of ice water. Mix well. Work the dough by slapping it on 
your mixing board or marble paste slab, and use your rolling- 
pin to pound it till it blisters. Chill the dough by laying it 
near ice for fifteen or twenty minutes. Next put it on your 
board and make it in a form a trifle larger and wider than 
the strip of cold butter. Lay on the strip of butter evenly 
and fold the flour dough over upon it, folding all four sides 
of the dough upon the butter. Upon a little sprinkled flour 
turn over the dough so that the butter side will be down, 
and roll out carefully. Do not break the dough and let the 
butter out. Fold the flat sheet threefold and set it by ice a 
quarter of an hour to chill. Next roll twice, fold again, and 
again put by ice to chill. Repeat the last directions. Finally 
roll out and chill before cutting into patties. Brush the under 
piece of the patty with ice water. Cut a piece the size of a 
half dollar out of the second piece, then lay the piece on the 
first and brush all with the yolk of a beaten egg. Set the 
patties near ice for an hour. Then bake in the lower part 
of a hot oven from twenty to thirty minutes. Puff paste 
scorches easily, and must be carefully baked. It is put in 
the hot oven thoroughly chilled, and the sudden change of 
temperature helps to puff it up. But if the oven is too hot, 
the paste browns before it puffs, and so becomes heavy and 
not puff paste at all, but a brown, greasy crust. 

This paste is used for holding all kinds of fruit preserves, 
and also creamed oysters, sweetbreads, and chicken.

THE BOON OF AN APPLE BARREL 

'HE housewife who has been careful to add to her winter 
1 stores a barrel of apples, for all winter long — almost till 
strawberries are cheap — has the wherewithal for most whole- 
some and appetizing dishes. It is better economy, no matter 
if the family is large, to purchase only one barrel in the fall. 
At intervals during the winter, when another barrel is re- 
quired, it may cost more, only one has to take into considera- 
tion the fact that in the ordinary furnace-heated cellar the 
lasting quality of apples is impaired. Better pay the cold stor- 
age man fifty cents for having kept them safely than throw 
away a dollar's worth of rotten fruit. If you are lucky enough 
to possess a cool vegetable cellar, it is economy to store away 
several barrels of apples late in the fall, when they are at their 
cheapest. New clean barrels and a cool calcimined cellar, 
with plenty of ventilation, are necessities, however. 

THE CARE OF APPLES 

The fruit should be examined once a week, being handled 
very carefully to prevent bruising. It is an excellent plan 
to keep an empty barrel for this purpose. Two or three 
decaying apples will speedily taint the flavor of a whole 
barrel, or make them rot. The fruit which is only 
slightly spoiled may be culled out, heaped in a peach basket 
and cooked at the earliest convenience. If you are a house- 



346 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

holder of the East, buy greenings, Baldwins, or russets ; they are 
the best-keeping winter apples. The Ben Davis and wine saps 
are two varieties most successfully stored in Western cellars. 

The professor, skilled in the science of food chemistry, 
tells us that apples contain gluten, albumen, pectine, fibrine, 
sugar, starch, malic acid, tannic acid, as well as water and 
traces of free salts. This all means little to the housewife un- 
skilled in chemistry; she only realizes that, in some subtle 
fashion of her own. Nature has stored away in the apple such 
a wealth of healthfulness and spicy flavors as is bestowed on 
few of the fruits of the tropics. It is full of the elements es- 
sential to the building up of sound tissues and the making of 
good blood. When eaten raw it is at its best. Every day pick 
the choicest apples from the barrel, polish with tissue paper, 
and pile in a pretty dish. Accustom the children of your house- 
hold to apple eating ; as a rule it is an easy task. When a meal 
is over, remove the apples to a cool pantry; they lose much 
flavor and crispness when left standing in a heated dining- 
room. 

The old adage, which said "Apples are gold in the morning, 
silver at noon, and lead at night," has been set aside by latter- 
day authorities on nutrition. They assure us that apples eaten 
raw are gold at night, because they excite the action of the 
liver, promote sound and healthy sleep, and prove excellent 
brain food. 

COOKED APPLES 

When one turns to the cooking of apples, first of all we 
think of wholesome apple sauce and delicious baked apples. 
For tried and true receipts for such wholesome fare, see the 
following pages and apple receipts among "Puddings." This 
is but a glance at the manifold uses of our most useful of fruits. 

APPLES AS SALAD 

Besides making most appetizing desserts, apples serve to 
help out the daily menu in many ways. Cut in cubes mixed 
with shredded celery and a few walnut meats and smothered 



STEWED FRUITS 347 

with a boiled dressing, sour apples form the base of the ex- 
cellent Waldorf salad. [See "Salads," page 161.J 

APPLE FRITTERS 

Sliced, dipped in a batter, fried in deep fat, and served with 
a sweet sauce, they are delicious as fritters. 

APPLE SAUCE 

Of necessity, apple sauce does not always await the en- 
trance of roast pork. It is good all winter long, for breakfast, 
luncheon, or supper, and it proves a most welcome variation 
to the housewife who sees her canned fruit supply running 
low. Apples for any cooking purpose should always be pared 
with a silver knife ; steel will spoil their color. For apple 
sauce, cook them in a tightly covered granite or white-lined 
saucepan. Take it from the fire as soon as the fruit is tender, 
sweeten, and serve warm. Do not sweeten if the sauce is to 
be served with pork. If you would have the finest possible 
flavor, put the apples with a very little water and sugar in a 
clean bean pot, set it in a hot oven, and bake. The sauce will 
have a rich red color and a most excellent taste. 

CIDER APPLE SAUCE 

Sometimes toward the approach of spring apples grow 
flavorless. Add to them — in any way they are cooked — a dash 
of lemon or orange juice, half a cup of grated pineapple or a 
few spoons of quince preserve. The addition of raisins, halved 
dates, or a little finely chopped orange peel often transforms 
plain apple sauce into a very attractive dish for the children's 
table. We must not forget the spicy, old-fashioned cider apple 
sauce, which is a good standby all winter long. Simmer down 
to a pint one quart of cider and add to it four quarts of sliced 
apples. Cook till tender, flavor with a bit of lemon peel, if 
desired; beat to a smooth cream, pour into stone jars, cover 
when cool, and set away in a dry cold place. This sauce may 



348 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

be made in a large quantity. It will keep perfectly till warm 
weather. See also "Apple Butter" following. 

APPLE BUTTER 

In a porcelain kettle boil clown six quarts of cider till it 
measures four quarts. Have half a peck of fine, easy cooking, 
juicy, sweet apples. Peel, core, and slice as many of the 
apples as the cider will cover and drop them in the boiling 
cider. When the apples are tender, take them out with a 




Appie Parer 

skimmer, and lay in a stone crock. Do exactly the same 
with the rest of the half peck of apples. Pour the cider over, 
stir up from the bottom, and let stand overnight. The next 
morning put all together in the kettle, and slowly cook down 
till you have a jam or butter consistency. Be sure your heat 
is only moderate, for the butter must not burn. Put in bottles 
or jars and seal. 

TO BAKE SOUR APPLES 

When baking apples do not remove the skins, even if it 
does not give the dish so sightly an appearance. Next to the 
skin lies the aromatic portion of the fruit. It is lost in paring. 
Choose the largest apples for baking. Wipe them clean, ar- 



STEWED FRUITS 349 

range in a granite or earthen dish, pouring a Httle water over 
and sprinkling with brown sugar. Bake in a moderate oven 
till soft, and cook to the core. Allow two or three hours if 
necessary. Turn occasionally during baking so they will cook 
evenly. 

TO BAKE SWEET APPLES 

Proceed as in the foregoing receipt, omitting the sugar. 

To turn a dripping-pan or other dish over the dish in which 
the apples, whether sweet or sour, are baking, helps them to 
cook by keeping in the steam, and gives an added flavor. 

Baked sweet apples are delicious served with sweet cream 
poured over them. 

FRIED APPLES 

Fried apples add zest to a dish of sausage or pork chops. 
See "Fried Apples and Pork," page 123. Wash the apples, 
slice them without peeling, and put them in a frying-pan, the 
bottom of which is liberally covered with hot drippings or 
butter. Cover tight, and let them cook till soft over a mod- 
erate fire. Stir occasionallv. Serve hot. 



NEW ENGLAND PAN DOWDY 

Years ago, when eggs were a luxury — not even obtainable 
at sixty cents a dozen — the apple desserts of our grandmothers 
called for no eggs, yet their goodness can scarcely be sur- 
passed to-day by the woman whose pride is fancy cooking. 

Pan dowdy was always made in a deep yellow baking dish. 
The dish was liberally buttered, the bottom and sides were 
lined crust-fashion with slices of buttered bread. It was filled 
with sliced apples, dusted with nutmeg or cinnamon, moistened 
with half a :cup of hot water, one cup of brown sugar, and 
two tablespoons of molasses. Finish with a top crust of 
liberally buttered bread, cover with a plate, bake slowly for 
an hour and a half. Serve turned out on a platter and with 
cream or hard sauce. 



350 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

STEWED DRIED APRICOTS 

Wash in three cold waters one pound of dried apricots. 
Put into a crock and cover them with cold water, which will 
be near one quart. Soak overnight. Next morning put into 
a good-sized preserving kettle with the water in which they 
have soaked. Add three pints more of cold water and one 
heaping teacup of sugar. After they begin to boil, stew them 
steadily and slowly one full hour and a half. The richness 
of fruit comes by slow boiling. Dried fruits are improved 
by stewing a long time, and gently. 

These directions may be followed and the sugar omitted 
if a sour apricot sauce is wished. 

STEWED CRANBERRIES 

Take one quart of cranberries, wash them in cold water, 
pour this off and put them in a porcelain-lined saucepan and 
pour over enough cold water barely to cover them. Stir in 
one small teaspoon of soda, without dissolving it in water. 
When the berries boil the soda will foam. When it stops 
foaming, add one teacup of sugar. Boil slowly, and when the 
cranberries are half done, mash them with the back of a 
spoon. Let them continue to boil about one hour, and when 
clear and rich they are done. Pour out into a crock or large 
bowl, and stir once in a while to prevent a scum forming 
over the top. 

BAKED PEARS 

A JEWISH RECEIPT 

Peel the pears and stick a couple of cloves in each pear. 
Put in an earthenware baking dish, sweeten to your taste, 
add water to afford plentiful juice in baking, and bake in a 
moderate oven till the pears are tender. Dip up the water in 
the pears now and then as they are baking. 

STEWED DRIED PRUNES 
Select a pound of medium-sized prunes. Wash them in 
three cold waters. Put them in a crock and cover with cold 



STEWED FRUITS 351 

water overnight. In the morning put them in a preserving 
kettle with the water they were soaked in. Add two more 
quarts of cold water, one full teacup of sugar, one sliced 
lemon. Cook slowly until there is more than enough juice to 
cover them, as they will absorb the juice after they are done. 
It will take two hours to cook them slowly. 

TO STEW PRUNES WITHOUT SUGAR 
Wash the prunes thoroughly in several waters, cover with 
cold water and boil or simmer slowly until tender. They will 
have a thick syrup juice, and if of a good quality will have 
considerable sugar in themselves and be quite sweet enough 
for some tastes. 

STEWED QUINCES AND APPLES 

Peel and cut three quinces in small sections. Cover them 
with plenty of water (without sugar) and cook until nearly 
tender. Save the peeling and cores, put them in another 
saucepan, cover well with water, and stew until the flavor of 
the quince has cooked into the water. Cut good flavored 
apples in small sections and add to the stewed quince. Strain 
and add the water in which the peelings and cores have 
boiled. Cover the mixed apples and quinces with water, 
sweeten to taste, and cook until the apples are rich and clear. 
Another way of flavoring apples is to boil ginger root with 
them, taking out the root when they are sufficiently flavored 
and adding several slices of lemon. 

STEWED RHUBARB 

Peel the rhubarb and cut it in inch pieces. Lay it in a 
large crock, wash quickly in cold water, and then cover with 
boiling water. Let it stand fifteen minutes, and pour off 
this water. Put it in a preserving kettle, and add a teacup of 
sugar to four cups of the fruit. Add no more water, as rhu- 
barb is very juicy. Let it stew steadily until clear and rich. 
Taste carefully, and sweeten only just enough to leave a slight 
acid.

SELECTION OF FRUIT 

IN canning fruit, if the work be done successfully, there are 
three important considerations : the condition of the fruit, 
the process employed, and the storing. 

The fruit must be fresh, of fine flavor, without bruise or 
blemish, and not over-ripe ; for, contradictory as it may ap- 
pear, the moment fruit reaches the point of perfect maturity 
it begins to deteriorate in quality. It is a prevalent but mis- 
taken notion which man}' economy-loving women hold, that 
the canning season should be delayed until fruit is at its 
cheapest. If taste is valued, first fruits should always be 
obtained for this purpose. 

As the acme of flavor and the highest nutritive properties 
lie nearest the rind, the most delicious fruits and those which 
keep longest are canned without being pared, after a careful 
washing and whisking with a stiff brush made for the pur- 
pose. If pared fruit is preferred, the thinnest possible rind 
should be removed with a silver knife, which does not dis- 
color, and the fruit plunged at once into a wooden or earthen 
vessel of cold water, as exposure to the air will darken it. 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 353 

BOILING 

Such fruits as peaches, pears, and the like, which harden 
when dropped into boiling syrup, should be cooked in clear 
boiling water until tender, then transferred, using a wire 
spoon, to glass jars — standing conveniently to hand in a pan 
of warm water — and the boiling syrup, clear as crystal, poured 
over them. Only enough fruit to fill one can should be 
cooked at a time. Fruit put up in this manner retains both 
flavor and shape, thereby being delicious to eat and good to 
look upon. Of course, it necessitates a little more time than 
to dump the fruit wholesale into a kettle and cook all at once, 
but to the woman who is satisfied with none but the best re- 
sults in her culinary work, it is time well spent. 

A very good proportion for the syrup is a pint of granu- 
lated sugar to a quart of water. Use only a porcelain-lined 
or granite kettle. Put in the sugar, pour over the water, stir 
until dissolved, then put to cook. Bring slowly to boil, and 
skim thoroughly before adding to fruit. Make only enough 
for two jars at one cooking. 

STEAMING 

Another method of canning the firmer sorts of fruits, one 
which ensures satisfactory results, is steaming. Line the 
bottom of a steamer with a clean white cloth, then put in a 
small quantity of prepared fruit; cover closely, and stand 
over a kettle of boiling water, which must be kept boiling 
without cessation until the fruit is tender, but not soft; then 
lift out, a piece at a time, and drop into boiling syrup ; cook a 
moment, fill cans, pour over syrup and cover closely, but 
do not seal. Let stand a moment to settle, uncover, fill up 
with boiling syrup, wipe away all moisture from lids and 
rim; then seal at once, taking pains to have the rubbei* show 
an even edge all around. 

On no account should berries intended for canning stand 
overnight. They ferment rapidly, even when kept in a cool 
place, become soft and mash in cooking'. To the neglect of 



854 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

this precaution may be traced many a failure. If such fruit 
must be utiHzed, make it into jam. 

Unless necessary, do not wash berries. Pick off stems 
and leaves with care to avoid bruising — for when the skin 
of the fruit is broken the syrup wall be discolored. As berries 
are by nature soft and mash easily when cooking, they should 
be cooked with the sugar, which has a tendency to make 
them firm. 

SMALL FRUITS 

The finest way to put up berries and other small fruits is 
as follows: Sprinkle with sugar in the proportions of half a 
pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Then fill into glass 
jars. Put on the lids of the jars, but not the rubber rings. 
Fit a board into the bottom of a w^ash-boiler ; wrap each 
jar in a clean towel or cloth, to prevent touching, then stand 
them in rows in the boiler. Fill the boiler with cold water 
to within half an inch of the tops ; bring the water to boil 
and continue boiling for fifteen minutes. Remove jars, wipe 
dry, fill up from a can set apart for the purpose, and seal 
without delay. Berries canned in this way will be whole, 
firm, and retain their natural flavor. 

Having selected one's fruit with care, then complied with 
the rules governing the cooking and sealing, the last but by 
no means least weighty consideration is the storing. 

STORING 

The fruit closet has three arch-enemies which, singly or 
combined, will play havoc with its stores. These are heat, 
light, moisture. The closet must have a dry situation, for 
moisture induces mould ; light working on the fruit genders 
an acid which no amount of sugar will overcome, and heat 
will cause fermentation. 

WINTER PRESERVES 

In mid-winter, empty fruit jars and jelly tumblers begin 
to accumulate, and the housewife looks with dismay at gaps 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 355 

on the shelves of her preserve closet. The stock, which must 
be made to spin out till fresh fruit is in plenty, may be added 
to occasionally, however, even when the markets display noth- 
ing but apples, oranges, grapefruit and cranberries. The pos- 
sibility for mid-winter preserves is by no means limited, and 
the result is sometimes quite appetizing. The British cook 
realizes the goodness of oranges as a preserving fruit ; the 
orange marmalade set before one with hot rolls at a real Scotch 
breakfast table is a combination not readily forgotten. 

APPLE JELLY 

If you own a barrel of apples and they begin to spot 
slightly, as even the best apples will do during the winter, it 
is economy to pick them over frequently and use all the specked 
apples for jelly. Pick out with a sharp knife every morsel of 
decay, then w^ash the apples w^ell in cold water, rubbing them 
with a cloth; for winter stored apples have a faculty for ac- 
cumulating dirt. Cut the fruit into thin slices, using both 
cores and skins. To each quart of apples add one pint of cold 
water, and set in a kettle over the fire in a large preserving 
kettle. If the apples are rather flavorless, add one lemon, 
finely sliced, to two quarts of apples. Stir frequently to pre- 
vent the fruit from burning. When it is reduced to a mush, 
pour it into a jelly bag of crash or flannel which has been 
wrung from hot water. Hang it to drain for twenty-four 
hours in as warm a place as possible. There is a large amount 
of gelatinous substance in apples. When gelatine is chilled, 
of course it solidifies, so if a jelly bag cools before the juice 
has run out quite an amount of it is lost. An excellent winter 
method for jelly making is to keep the bag suspended as near 
as possible to a hot register. Allow for each pint of juice one 
pint of sugar. Set the juice to boil for twenty minutes and 
put the sugar to heat in a moderate oven. After the boiling- 
down process is done, pour in the heated sugar, when the 
babbling will scarcely be interrupted. Pour it in heated tum- 
blers after five minutes' cooking. Leave it to cool, then cover 



§56 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

with paraffine. One secret of quick and perfect jellying is to 
have everything which comes in contact with the juice quite hot. 

APPLE GINGER 
Pare two and a half pounds of sour apples, core and chop 
them coarse. Put in a saucepan with a pound and a half of 
brown sugar, the rind and juice of one and a half lemons, 
half an ounce of ginger-root and one cup of cold water. Let 
the fruit come to boil, then set back on the stove where it will 
merely simmer for four or five hours. Stir occasionally to keep 
it from burning. Put hot into jars and seal. 

BLACKBERRY JAM 
Blackberry jam is made after the same receipt. Take one 
quart of berries from each gallon. Heat them and strain the 
juice, adding it to the berries and thus avoiding too many seeds. 

BRANDIED CHERRIES 

AND OTHER FRUITS 

Have perfectly ripe, but not over-ripe, sound, sweet 
cherries. Keep their stems by cutting them short, or carefully 
free the fruit wholly from stems. Drop the cherries, a few 
at a time, in a boiling syrup made of a pint of water and 
half a pound of sugar. When they have boiled three to five 
minutes, lift out and lay them on plates. Allow to cool and to 
dry as they cool. They should be perfect in form. Make a 
second syrup twice as sweet as the first; that is, use a pound 
of sugar to a pint of water. After the syrup boils clear, set it 
aside to cool. Carefully pack the cherries in glass jars. To 
the cooled second syrup add its same liquid measure of the 
best brandy. Pour the mixed syrup and brandy over the 
cherries in the jars, seal, and set in a dry, dark, cool fruit closet. 

Other fruits may be brandied by this receipt. 

CRAB-APPLE JELLY 

Choose red-skin crabs. Wash, cut off all spots and blem- 
ishes, and quarter, keeping the peel and the cores. Put in a 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES cloT 

preserving, kettle with enough water to rise in sight. Boil 
gently till the apples are tender and falling to pieces. Put in 
a jelly bag — preferably a flannel bag — and let the juice drip 
into an earthen bowl. If you squeeze the pulp the jelly will 
be cloudy. Measure the juice by pints and allow a pound of 
sugar to each pint. Simmer at the bubbling point a full twenty 
minutes. Then put in the sugar, which you have weighed and 
heated. Cook five minutes at a bubbling point. If you test 
on a saucer you will find the syrup a jelly. If by any inad- 
vertence or inaccuracy it is not a jelly, cook longer. Finally put 
in jelly glasses while hot. After the jelly hardens, lay on top 
brandied paper and cover tight. Keep in a cool, dry, dark 
place. 

CRANBERRY CATSUP 
If the catsup supply is running low, replenish with a de- 
licious substitute made from cranberries. Cook together ten 
pounds of the berries, one quart of vinegar, five pounds of 
brown sugar, three tablespoons of cinnamon, two tablespoons 
of allspice, one tablespoon each of cloves and salt, and quarter 
of a teaspoon of cayenne. Boil slowly till thick, then strain 
and bottle. 

SPICED CRANBERRIES 
This abundant winter fruit makes an excellent relisli 
when spiced. Boil together three and a half pounds of brown 
sugar, two cups of vinegar, two tablespoons each of ground 
cinnamon and allspice, and one tablespoon of ground cloves. 
When this has been cooked to a syrup, add five pounds of 
cranberries. Simmer slowl}- for two hours. Put away in a 
covered stone jar. 

RAISIN AND CRANBERRY JAM 
Seed one cup of fine plump raisins, put them to stew in a 
granite saucepan wnth one quart of cold water. When the 
liquid is reduced to one pint, add four cups of cranberries and 
two and a half cups of sugar. Simmer very slowly till the 
cranberries are thoroughly cooked, then can and seal. 



•358 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SPICED CURRANTS OR OTHER FRUIT 

To eight pounds of the fruit take four pounds of sugar 
and one pint of vinegar. In an earthen preserving kettle 
heat together the vinegar and sugar. Add a tablespoon each 
of powdered cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Have your 
fruit in perfect condition and cleanliness. Stir in the syrup 
and cook till done. Set in tumblers or jars and seal. 

CURRANT JELLY 

Free the currants from leaves, but do not take from the 
small stems. Examine carefully for insects and then wash in 
cold water. Drain thoroughly, and afterward stew the cur- 
rants in a porcelain preserving kettle till they are cooked to 
a soft mass. Tip into a colander. Press through, and then 
strain twice through a thick bag — preferably a flannel bag. 
Boil fifteen minutes, and then to each pint of juice add a 
pound and a quarter of granulated sugar which you have well 
warmed. Do not plump the sugar in all at once, but stir in a 
little at a time. When the sugar is thoroughly stirred in, the 
juice is at the jelly point. If you have doubts, test it; and if 
necessary, cook a little more. Pour into glasses and set to cool. 
When cold, cover with brandied paper or paraffine, and also 
glass or metal cover. 

FIG MARMALADE 

To every two pounds of fresh ripe figs allow a pound and 
a half of sugar and the grated yellows and juice of a large 
lemon and a large orange. Cut the figs in small pieces and 
boil with the orange and lemon, often stirring them, till you 
have a thick, smooth marmalade. Put away in jelly glasses 
and jars with paraffine covering over the top. 

PRESERVED FIGS 

This preparation is more of a confection than a preserve. 
It is delicious, and affords at a moderate price a dainty which 
costs extravagantly when bought at a grocery. Buy the finest 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 359 

dried figs, pull them apart and wipe each one with a piece of 
wet cheesecloth. Weigh them and set aside their weight in 
granulated sugar. Soak the figs overnight in cold water, then 
simmer very slowly in just enough water to cover thenv Lift 
them out carefully and set to cool. Make a syrup from the 
water in which they were cooked and the sugar. Put the figs 
back in the syrup, adding a few bits of green ginger, the juice 
of two lemons and the rind of one to one pound of figs. 
Simmer for ten minutes, drain ofif the figs, set them to dry 
slightly in a moderate oven, and boil the syrup till quite thick. 
Put the figs in glass jars, pour the syrup over them and seal 
while hot. 

SPICED GOOSEBERRIES ' 
Head and tail three quarts of gooseberries. With a little 
water to cover the bottom of the kettle stew them a few 
minutes till their fibre is relaxed. Then add one pint of 
vinegar, a quart and a half of sugar, a teaspoon of ground 
cloves, two tablespoons of ground cinnamon, half a tea- 
spoon of white pepper, and half a teaspoon of salt. Use a 
porcelain kettle, and boil the fruit and the syrup thirty or 
forty minutes over a slow fire. Seal in bottles or glasses 
for use. 

SPICED GRAPES 
Pulp the grapes. Boil up the pulp fill the fibre softens 
and loosens the seeds. To every three quarts of skins and 
pulp add the syrup described in the foregoing receipt, 
namely, a pint of vinegar, a quart and a half of sugar, a 
teaspoon of ground cloves, two tablespoons of ground cin- 
namon, half a teaspoon of salt, and half a teaspoon of white 
pepper. In a porcelain kettle gently boil all these ingredients, 
allowing thirty to forty minutes for a complete, slow cooking. 
Put in bottles, seal, and set in the fruit closet for use. 

GRAPE JELLY 
Choose grapes just turning ripe. Pick from the stems and 
cook in a preserving kettle, allowing a cup of water to each 



860 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pound of grapes. When the grapes are cooked soft, put in a 
jelly bag and let the juice drip in an earthen bowl. If you 
squeeze the bag the jelly will be cloudy. Cook the strained 
juice about twenty minutes. Then add a pound of warmed 
sugar to each pint of juice. Simmer at a bubble five minutes, 
^kim and put in jelly glasses while hot. After the jelly cools, 
lay over paper dipped in brandy, and seal. 

CITRON MELON PRESERVE 

Peel and slice the melon thin, or in small quarters. To 
every pound of citron allow one pound of sugar and quarter 
of a pound of ginger-root. Put the melon in water enough to 
cover, add to this water two teaspoons of soda, boil until just 
tender, and set to cool. When cold, soak in a strong alum 
water one hour. Make a syrup of one pint of water and two 
pounds of sugar. Beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth, 
add this to the sugar and water, stir, let it boil, and skim off 
the egg. As the egg clears the sugar and water add the 
ginger-root and melon and cook in this syrup until clear. Put 
in glass jars (not too full), and cover with the syrup. 

ORANGE JELLY 

Slice oranges very thin. Put in preserving kettle and 
cover with cold water. Boil for two hours. A delicately 
tart jelly will be obtained. After boiling the water and pulp, 
pour it into a strainer lined with cheesecloth and let the liquid 
drip. To one pint of juice add one pint of heated sugar. Boil 
till a drop will jelly when poured on a cold plate. Put into 
glasses and cover with paraffine. 

ORANGE JUICE AND YELLOW 

First be sure your oranges are clean, then wash and wipe 
them dry. From a quarter of them grate ofif the yellow skin. 
Roll them all upon a board under the hand, halve them, and 
squeeze out all the juice. Put the grated yellow, and measure 
the orange- juice, into a porcelain-lined fruit kettle. Set over 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 361 

the fire, and when it begins to boil, add as much sugar as you 
measured of the juice. Cook slowly till the juice thickens and 
put in glasses and seal. 

ORAXGE-AND-LEMON MARMALADE 

Wash in cold water, scrubbing the skins with a vegetable 
brush, one dozen sour oranges and six lemons. Dry them 
and cut off the ends, then slice very thin on a vegetable gutter. 
Pick the seeds from this pulp and put them to soak in two 
cups of cold water. Put the pulp in a large preserving kettle, 
cover with one gallon of cold water and let it stand for thirty- 
six hours. Then strain the seeds, add the water from them to 
the shredded fruit and set the kettle to boil slowly for two 
hours. Add ten pounds of sugar and boil for another hour 
or till it jellies. Pour into tumblers, and when cool cover 
with melted paraffine. This marmalade, if made when oranges 
sell for twenty-five cents a dozen, costs about four cents a 
tumbler. If you desire a more decided tang of acid to this 
preserve, use four grapefruits instead of six oranges, and 
make the marmalade after exactly the same rule. 

AIIXED MARMALADE 

Crush two pounds and a half each of currants and pitted 
cherries. Add two pounds of seeded raisins, the yellow peel 
of four oranges chopped fine, and three pounds of sugar. Cook 
gently till the fruit is a marmalade, adding a little water if 
needed. Add the juice of the oranges just before the marma- 
lade is ready to le^ve the stove. Cook ten minutes after putting 
in the juice. 

GINGER-ROOT PEARS 

In a preserving kettle steep in two cups of water quarter of 

a pound of green ginger-root, or half a pound of candied 

ginger-root, after cutting it in small pieces. Add eight pounds 

of sugar and let boil to a syrup. Cut the inside of four lemons 

in small pieces and add to the syrup. Cut also and add the 

lemon rinds — not the white part, but strips of the thin yellow 

io Vol. 2 



3G2 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

skin. Take eight pounds of peeled pears, slice the fruit, and 
add. Cook very slowly until all is thick like a jelly. 

SPICED PEARS 

Take one teaspoon of whole cloves, one tablespoon of all- 
spice and one tablespoon of cinnamon. Crush them slightly, 
and boil one minute in a quart of vinegar and a pint of sugar 
mixed. Select a fine variety of pear, halve, taking out the 
seeds, and boil in water until nearly tender. Finish the cook- 
ing in the spiced syrup, cooking them not too soft. Place them 
in small stone jars and cover well with the syrup. Tie a 
cover over the jar. 

SPICED PEACHES 

Spiced peaches are made the same as spiced pears, except 
they are not boiled in water. The syrup will cook them 
sufficiently. 

PEACH MARMALADE 

For marmalade, take half a peck of very ripe yellow free- 
stone peaches and half a peck of white freestones. Pare, 
stone, and weigh them, allowing three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to each pound of fruit. Put one pint of water in the 
bottom of the kettle before the fruit is added. Add the peaches 
and stand on the stove where it is not too hot, to draw their 
juice, stirring from the bottom wath a w^ooden spoon. Set an 
asbestos plate under to keep from scorching. When the juice 
is well drawn out, boil hard until the mixture pops and sinks. 
Then add the sugar which has been heated quite hot. Boil 
until thick and not too stifif, which will be from half to three- 
quarters of an hour. Put in glasses or jars and cover over 
with brandied paper or paraffine, 

SPICED BLUE PLUMS 

Rinse in cold water, and wipe dry, two pounds of blue 
plums. Prick each one. Boil one minute one pint of vinegar, 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 363 

with one pound of sugar, one tablespoon of whole allspice, one 
tablespoon and a half of stick cinnamon, and one dessertspoon 
of cloves, having crushed the spices slightly and tied them in 
a lace bag. Lay the fruit in a stone jar. Pour the hot vinegar 
over it for nine mornings, heating it each day. The last 
morning, boil the plums in the spiced vinegar twenty minutes. 
Damsons are spiced in the same way. 

TO PRESERVE PUMPKIN FOR WINTER USE 
Wipe off and cut open the pumpkin and take out the seeds 
and soft network within. Cut into half moons, and trim off 
the hard outside rind. Then cut the meat in small pieces, put 
in a steamer over a kettle of boiling water, cover tight by 
laying a weight on the cover, and steam slowly three or four 
hours, or until the pulp or meat is perfectly tender. Then 
put through a colander. Next put the pumpkin pulp in a 
kettle, set it over a very slow, gentle fire — in this have care, 
for pumpkin burns easily — and heat the pumpkin hot, and dry 
it out. While it is still hot put it in glass bottles or cans, seal 
tight, and set it in the fruit closet for use. 

GRATED QUINCES 

Grate your quinces, and to each cup of grated fruit add 
two and a half cups of sugar and two cups of water. Boil 
slowly for an hour or more and seal in jelly glasses. 

RAISIN JAM 

Wash seedless raisins. To each pound allow one cup of 
cold water, and simmer gently over the fire for an hour. Then 
add a cup of sugar to each pound of raisins, and also a sliced 
lemon. Simmer again for an hour, put in glasses, cover with 
paraffine, and set away for use. 

BLACK RASPBERRY JAM 

Crush half of your berries, heat in a preserving kettle, and 
then put through a sieve. Add the juice to the other whole 



364 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

berries, let come to boil, add quarter of a pound of sugar to 
each box of berries, and simmer till the jam is thick. Put 
in small glasses or jars, cover with paraffine, and set in a dry, 
cool, dark place for use. 

RED RASPBERRY JAM 
To six boxes of red raspberries add five pounds of sugar 
and the juice of four lemons. Cook slowly together in a pre- 
serving kettle and put away in small glasses or jars, sealed or 
covered with paraffine. 

STRAWBERRY JAM 
For every pound of fruit allow half a pound of sugar. Put 
the berries in a preserving kettle. Stand the kettle back on 
the stove where it is not too hot, to draw out the juice. When 
the juice is well drawn, bring forward and let boil until the 
berries pop and sink, stirring occasionally. Have the sugar 
hot, add to the berries, and stir almost constantly with a 
wooden spoon. Let boil until quite firm without being stiflf, 
which will be from half to three-quarters of an hour. Set an 
asbestos plate under to prevent the fruit burning. Put away in 
jelly glasses or jars, cutting a paper to fit the top and wetting 
it with brandy. 

SUN PRESERVES 
For cherries, strawberries, gooseberries, red raspberries, 
currants, etc., take two pounds of fruit to two pounds of sugar. 
Prepare the fruit and have it in perfect condition. Melt the 
sugar in a preserving kettle by adding just enough water to 
moisten it and let it boil up clear. Then add the fruit and let 
boil two minutes. Pour into platters and shallow earthen 
dishes, and set in the hot sunshine two or three days. Bring 
in the preserve each night ; that is, do not let dew or dampness 
get to it. Put away in jelly glasses or jars. 

TOMATO JAM 
Peel seven pounds of tomatoes and let them lie in a jar in 
one quart of vinegar overnight. Next morning put them in an 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 365 

earthen preserving kettle and boil. When nearly done, add 
three and a half pounds of sugar, two teaspoons of cinnamon, 
one teaspoon of cloves, and two teaspoons of mace. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI 

Put into a large stone jar or crock with a closely fitting 
cover one quart of good preserving brandy. For every pound 
of fruit which you use as you proceed you must add three- 
quarters of a pound of granulated sugar. You must use only 
the best of dry, good fruit in sound condition and of choice 
flavor. Every kind of fruit may be usfed, commencing with 
strawberries. The mixture must be stirred every day with -a 
large wooden spoon in order that the sugar may be well dis- 
solved. The jar must be kept in a dry, cool place. Use as 
much of any kind of fruit as you may desire, remembering the 
proportionate quantity of sugar. Beginning with strawberries 
and the sugar, follow on with cherries, pineapples, currants, 
raspberries, apricots, plums, peaches, grapes, peeling and seed- 
ing all of the fruits except the berries. Use at least one pound 
of black cherries as a dark coloring, always remembering ac- 
curacy as to the proportionate amount of sugar and the daily 
stirring.

SWEET PICKLES 

EVERY Storeroom should have an assortment of sweet 
pickles. They are boons to the housewife ; not only be- 
cause they are such acceptable appetizers for lunch-basket, 
luncheon, and tea tables, but also because the}^ may be trans- 
formed into many delightful emergency dishes suitable for 
an entree or a dessert. 

A pickled peach or pear, or a bunch of pickled cherries 
in a pastry shell, dressed with a little spiced liquor, makes a 
most toothsome morsel. Plain cake and sweet pickled fruit 
combine so agreeably that they seem made for each other. 
Several varieties of pickled fruit may be served together as a 
spiced fruit salad. These are but three of the many dishes 
which may be concocted by using the sweet pickle as a basis. 
Others will suggest themselves. 

SYRUP FOR SWEET PICKLES 

Any fruit or vegetable that can be preserved may be made 
into sweet pickle. A very good proportion for the syrup is 
three pints of "coffee C" sugar to one quart of good cider 
vinegar. The spices commonly used for this variety of pickle 
are cloves and cinnamon, and the proportion two teaspoons 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 867 

of the former and four tablespoons of the latter to each gallon 
of fruit. 

The appended receipts if followed to the letter can not fail 
to give satisfactory results. 

SWEET APPLE PICKLES 

Sweet apples may be prepared in the way directed for 
"Sweet Pear Pickles," and are especially nice. 

SWEET BEET PICKLES 

Cook the beets till tender ; slip ofif the skins and cut into 
slices ; place in glass jars, fill up with spiced syrup, boiling 
hot, and seal. 

SWEET CANTALOUPE PICKLES 

Select melons that are not quite ripe ; open, scrape out 
the pulp, peel, slice, and lay in a weak brine overnight. Next 
morning boil in a weak alum water till transparent ; lift out, 
drain, wipe dry, then drop into boiling spiced syrup and cook 
twenty minutes, 

SWEET PEACH PICKLES 

Take four quarts of peaches of a gentle acid flavor and 
tender fibre. Peel, but do not stone. In a porcelain kettle 
boil a quart of cider vinegar with four pounds of sugar, a 
tablespoon of mace, a tablespoon of cloves, and a tablespoon 
of cinnamon broken small. Tie the spices in a bag of thin 
muslin, or if you prefer, tie the other spices and stick the 
cloves through the meat of the peaches. When the cider 
boils, drop in the peaches, and when they all boil up, skim 
and boil six minutes. Gently take the peaches from the 
s)Tup, lay them in the bottom of a crock. Boil the syrup 
fifteen minutes longer, pour over the peaches, cool and cover 
tight, and keep in a cool place. 



368 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SWEET PEAR PICKLES 
Pare and halve the fruit; then drop it into boiling syrup, 
and cook until tender enough to pierce with a silver fork. 
Transfer to a stone jar, sprinkle with spices, cover with 
boiling syrup, let stand overnight; next morning finish as 
directed for "Sweet Peach Pickles." 

SWEET DAMSON PLUM PICKLES 
Scald together the vinegar and sugar; skim, add spices, 
boil up once, then turn over fruit. Draw off and scald the 
vinegar twice more at intervals of three days, the last time 
boiling the fruit twenty minutes. 

SWEET PRUNE PICKLES 

Soak a day in cold water after washing thoroughly two 
pounds of prunes. Then steam them till they are soft and 
tender. In an earthen kettle make a syrup of a pound of 
sugar, half a pint of vinegar, half an ounce of cinnamon 
and cloves, and a couple of pinches of ginger if your taste 
directs, but the ginger may be omitted. When the syrup 
boils, add the prunes and boil together fifteen minutes. 

SWEET STRAWBERRY PICKLES 

Place the berries in layers In a jar with spices between. 
Pour over them the boiling syrup. Let stand twenty-four 
hours closely covered ; then draw off the syrup, boil and pour 
over the fruit again. Let stand as before, then turn the whole 
into a preserving kettle and cook slowly, without stirring, for 
thirty minutes. Pickle other small fruits in the same manner. 

SWEET WATERMELON PICKLES 

Select a fine ripe melon ; pare off the outer green rind and 
red core. Cut into inch squares, and place in a preserving 
kettle with two teaspoons of salt for each gallon of rinds. 
Nearly cover with water and boil until tender. Drain in a 
colander; then proceed as directed for "Sweet Peach Pickles." 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 369 

HOME-MADE CATSUPS 

The various catsups are highly appreciated by the good 
cook, who not only employs them for the purpose of impart- 
ing an agreeable flavor to meats and other solid foods at 
table, but also as a piquant seasoning for soups, gravies, meat 
sauces, hashes, stews, and similar dishes. 

To buy these condiments ready prepared and of a de- 
sirable quality one must needs pay a fancy price ; but when 
manufactured at home, their cost is insignificant. 

Use only perfect fruit for catsups ; cook in a porcelain 
kettle ; bottle in glass or stone. 

To prevent mould, do not fill the bottles quite to the top 
with catsup, but fill up with hot vinegar. 

CUCUMBER CATSUP 
Peel and chop three dozen cucumbers and half as many 
onions very fine. Add one teacup of mustard-seed, a quarter 
of a teacup of black pepper, and one ounce each of cloves and 
allspice. Mix well and cover with vinegar. 

CURRANT CATSUP 
Cook together until thick six quarts of currant- juice and 
five pounds of sugar. Then add one quart of vinegar, three 
tablespoons of cinnamon, two of allspice, one each of cloves, 
nutmeg and salt, and half an ounce of cayenne. Boil twenty 
minutes, bottle and seal. 

GOOSEBERRY CATSUP 
Scald, mash and put through a colander nine pounds of 
ripe fruit. Add five pounds of sugar, three tablespoons of 
cinnamon, and half a tablespoon each of cloves and allspice. 
Boil twenty minutes, add one quart of cold vinegar, bottle, and 
seal without delay. 

RIPE GRAPE CATSUP 
Make ripe grape catsup by the same formula as "Goose- 
berry Catsup."

sugar, and one pint of salt. Boil two hours longer, stirring 
constantly. Bottle cold. 

RED TOMATO CATSUP 

Mash very ripe tomatoes to a pulp, put them in an earthen 
jar, cover, and stir them twice each day. They will ferment. 
After three days, rub them through a sieve and put the part 
that goes through the sieve to cook in a porcelain-lined pot. 
Let it boil till of a creamy thickness. To each gallon of cook- 
ing pulp add half a pound of sugar, half a cup of salt, one 
teaspoon of cayenne, and half a pint of vinegar. Boil fifteen 
minutes, fill the bottles while hot, and seal tight. 

WALNUT CATSUP 
Gather the walnuts when green and soft. Grind or pound 
in an earthen or marble mortar; then turn into a stone jar, 
sprinkle with salt and cover with vinegar. Let stand a week, 
stirring well each day ; then strain through a coarse cloth. 
To each gallon of the liquor add one ounce each of whole 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 371 

cloves, peppercorns, ginger, mace, and celery seed, half a nut- 
meg broken fine, one clove of garlic, and half a teaspoon of 
cayenne. Boil all slowly till reduced one-half. Strain, and 
bottle when cold. 

WORCESTERSHIRE CATSUP

large ripe tomatoes. Add half a tablespoon of salt, twenty- 
four tablespoons of brown sugar, and half a teaspoon each of 
ginger, cloves, and cinnamon. Boil all together two hours, 
put in bottles, and seal. 

CHOW-CHOW 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

(To be put in quart jars for winter use.) Chop fine four 
Spanish onions and one dozen large green tomatoes. Add one 
large cauliflower cut in small pieces, not the leaves, only the 
heart or flower. Add fifty very small onions and twenty-four 
small cucumbers. Mix in two teacups of salt, put in a deep 
stone jar, and let stand twenty- four hours. Then cover with 
a mixture of vinegar and water for two days. Drain off all 



872 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

liquor and add the following, mixing in thoroughly: Half a 
pint of grated horseradish, half a pound of white mustard 
seed, half a pound of celery seed, four tablespoons of cayenne 
pepper, half a dozen minced dried red peppers, two and a half 
tablespoons of tamarack, one teacup of white sugar, two bottles 
— about two cups — of French mustard, one gallon of cider 
vinegar. Mix thoroughly, put in jars, and seal for use. 

CHOW-CHOW PICKLE 

Have four large cabbage heads, one peck of green toma- 
toes, one quart of onions, one dozen cucumbers, and three 
green peppers. Chop fine. Mix in two handfuls of salt, tie 
in a strong cheesecloth bag and drain overnight. Next morn- 
ing add one ounce of celery seed, one ounce of mustard seed, 
half a box of mustard, one pound of sugar. Put in a preserv- 
ing kettle, cover with cider vinegar, put over the fire, and cook 
slowly till the pickles are tender — but not till they lose form. 
li needed, add more vinegar while cooking. 

INDIA CHUTNEY 

Put together two quarts of chopped apples, two quarts of 
green tomatoes, one pound of raisins, three cups of brown 
sugar, one cup of lemon- juice, one small onion chopped, three 
cups of vinegar, half a cup of salt, one teaspoon of cayenne, 
and one tablespoon of ginger. Mix and let stand in an earthen 
dish overnight and next morning boil till tender. 

STUFFED CUCUMBERS 

Pack medium-sized cucumbers in dry coarse salt. They 
caH be left any length of time in the brine, or in two weeks 
can be taken from the brine. Soak them in tepid water three 
days, changing the water each day. Without paring cut 
them in two halves lengthwise. Cut out of each half a small 
strip. Fill the space with black and white mustard seeds, 
wet with olive oil. In each one put some pieces of very thin 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 373 

strips of horseradish. Tie the halves together with small strips 
of cheesecloth. This done, divide the quantity in half. Put half 
in a preserving kettle. Sprinkle horseradish finely shaved 
through them. Allow two red (chilli) peppers to a kettleful. 
In the centre put one sliced onion, one teaspoon of pulverized 
alum, and a small bag holding one tablespoon of allspice and 
one teaspoon of whole cloves. Put in the rest of the pickles. 
Add horseradish, one teaspoon of alum, and one small teacup of 
brown sugar. Cover the whole with cold vinegar. Set on 
the stove, gradually heat, and when it comes to boil the pickles 
are done. Put away in small stone jars. Tie a cloth over 
the top. 

YELLOW CUCUMBER PICKLE 

Cut yellow cucumbers in slices (crosswise) not quite half 
an inch thick. Pack them in a stone jar in layers, with coarse 
salt between. Lay a plate on top with a weight on it. Let 
stand overnight. Next day pour off the water. Put them in 
a granite preserving kettle in layers and mix through the fol- 
lowing ingredients : Six large onions chopped fine, one teacup 
of brown sugar, two tablespoons of dry mustard, two table- 
spoons of celery seed, two tablespoons of white mustard seed, 
one tablespoon of ground cloves, two tablespoons of ground 
cinnamon, two tablespoons of black pepper and of horse- 
radish chopped fine, four small red peppers, two tablespoons 
of turmeric powder, and one dessertspoon of pulverized alum. 
Cover with cold vinegar. Set it on the stove to gradually 
:come to boil. As soon as it bubbles, take it from the fire. Put 
away in sealed glass jars. 

MANGO PICKLES 

Take out the inside of green peppers and soak the peppers 
overnight in strong salt water. Next morning simmer the 
peppers in fresh water made slightly acid with vinegar. When 
they are tender, fill each pepper with chow-chow, put them in 
a crock, and cover with hot weak vinegar. 



874 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

PEPPER MANGOES 
Select the long sweet peppers. Cut a long slit in the side 
of each. Very carefully cut out the centre with a small pen- 
knife, not touching the seeds. Rinse in cold water and lay 
in strong salt and water twenty-four hours. Rinse in cold 
water at the end of that time, drain, and wipe dry. Fill the 
peppers with the following dressing: Cabbage and onion 
chopped fine, and separately. Use twice as much cabbage as 
onion. Season with black and white mustard seeds, celery seed, 
and chopped horseradish, moistened with a small quantity of 
vinegar and olive oil. After filling, sew together the opening. 
Put in a jar, and cover with cold vinegar. 

MUSTARD PICKLE 
Peel and cut large cucumbers in pieces from half an inch 
to three-quarters of an inch in length until you have one 
quart. Add one quart of w^iite onions cut small, one quart 
of green tomatoes, four large sweet peppers, one quart of 
small cucumbers, and one large head of cauliflower. All these, 
except very small cucumbers, are cut in small pieces. Put 
into a brine made of one gallon of water and a cup of salt, and 
stand twenty-four hours. Then scald in the same brine, and 
drain w^ell. For the mustard dressing, mix one cup of flour 
with two cups of sugar, six tablespoons of ground mustard, 
one tablespoon of tamarack, and two quarts of cider vinegar. 
Scald all together, and the pickles are ready for use. 

NASTURTIUM SEEDS 
Keep a glass jar of cider vinegar in a cool place, and 
drop in the seeds of your nasturtium flowers — when the seeds 
are full formed and green, but not when they have become 
hard and yellow. These pickled seeds are an excellent sub- 
stitute for capers in making sauce for boiled mutton. 

PICCALILLI 
Take as many green tolnatoes as you wish, and one-fourth 
as many onions. Slice and put in layers, sprinkling two 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 375 

tablespoons of salt over every third layer. Let stand over- 
night and drain. Add one-third as much chopped cabbage, 
and then chop all together. Add whole mustard, ginger-root, 
peppers — either green or red — cloves, allspice, cinnamon, horse- 
radish if you have it, and a little brown sugar — all these to 
your taste for hot things and judgment. Cover with the best 
vinegar in a porcelain preserving kettle, scald thoroughly, and 
seal air-tight till used. 

GREEN TOMATO PICKLE 

Slice green tomatoes one-quarter of an inch thick. Put 
them in a stone jar overnight in layers with coarse salt 
sprinkled between. Lay a plate on top with a weight on it. 
Next morning drain off the water (without rinsing). Put 
the tomatoes in a preserving kettle, in layers, and mix through 
the following ingredients : Six onions chopped fine and four 
green peppers freed from their seeds and chopped, almost all 
of one root of horseradish chopped fine, four small red pep- 
pers (not chopped), two tablespoons of black pepper, one 
tablespoon of ground cloves, two tablespoons of allspice, one 
tablespoon of dry mustard, and one teacup and a half of 
brown sugar. Cover with cold vinegar. Set the kettle on 
the stove. Let the vinegar slowly heat, and boil until the 
tomatoes are partly tender. Put them away in glass jars 
covered.

BOILED COFFEE 

PUT into the coffee-pot three-quarters of a teacup of ground 
coffee. Mix this with one teacup of cold water. For 
settUng it, use a piece of dried codfish skin two inches square, or 
one-quarter of an egg, the yolk and white mixed together (not 
beaten). Stir in a piece of the shell. Add two teacups of 
boiling water. Set it on the stove and boil hard ten minutes, 
covering the pot tight. Stir the coffee down from the sides 
as it rises. When it is done, it will no longer rise. After 
boiling it quickly, set it back on the stove and boil ten min- 
utes more. When this is done, pour in one-quarter of a tea- 
cup (scant) of cold water to settle it. Keep hot to serve, 
and boil no more. A good way to keep anything hot is to set 
an asbestos plate underneath, back from the fire. Otherwise 
the cooking will continue. 

TO CLEAR COFFEE 

Two things are good for clearing coffee, one is egg, the 
other is the skin of a salt codfish. The codfish clears coffee 
much better than egg. Take a salt codfish, peel off and dry 
the skin in a warm place. When dried, cut into pieces about 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 



377 



two inches square. When you have mixed your coffee with 
cold water, throw into it a piece of the skin, and add the 
boihng water, and boil. There will not be any flavor of the 
salt fish in the coffee. 

DRIP COFFEE 
Allow one tablespoon of ground coffee to one cup of boil- 
ing water. Put the ground coffee in the strainer of a French 
coffee-pot. Slowly pour the boiling water, half a cup at a 




French Coffee-Pot and its Filter 



time, over the ground coffee. Cover the pot tight between the 
half cups. When the water is filtered through, pour through 
a second time. Take the strainer from the pot. Carry the 
coffee to the table boilinsf hot. 



BLACK COFFEE 
In the strainer of a drip coffee-pot put finely ground 
coffee, allowing two tablespoons of coffee to one cup of boil- 
ing water. Pour fresh boiling water over the coffee, let stand 
a moment and then serve. To ensure getting the strength of 
the coffee, be sure the coffee is finely ground and the water 
is boiling hot. 

TURKISH COFFEE 
Have fresh-roasted coffee ground to a fine powder. In 
a small coffee cup put a heaping teaspoon of the ground coffee 



378 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and a lump of sugar, or sugar to your taste. Fill up the cup 
with boiling water, stirring as you pour in the coffee, so 
that the boiling water will touch all the powder. The 
grounds are drunk with the liquid. The strength of this 
cup may be increased by doubling the quantity of the ground 
coffee. 

TO MAKE TEA 

Scald an earthen teapot and put in one teaspoon of tea for 
each cup you will need, allowing one teaspoon for the teapot. 
Pour in fresh boiling water, not water that has boiled some 
time, but water that has just begun to boil. Stand in a warm 
place five minutes for the leaves to steep, not on a hot stove, 
but on a water tank or other warm place where the teapot is 
kept warm. Serve a slice of lemon with each cup, or cream 
or milk. 

COOL BEVERAGES FOR SUMMER DAYS 

One always associates tinkling ice and crystal with warm 
weather, and there is nothing more appreciated by the 
weather-worn and thirsty than a homemade, cooling, non- 
intoxicating beverage. 

Summer drinks should be served from crystal pitchers 
and in thin glasses. One can buy such pretty articles in 
pressed glass nowadays that heavy earthenware receptacles 
and thick, inartistic glasses are out of place and inexcusable. 

The simplest lemonade tastes better when sipped through 
straws. A box of one hundred straws may be purchased for 
a small sum, and they are well worth the investment. 

Iced tea is a favorite beverage for summer tables, but the 
receipt given here is as unlike that usually masquerading 
under this title as black is from white. 

ICED COFFEE 

For icea coffee to serve in the afternoon or evening make 
the coffee in the morning. Sweeten to taste, and set to cool. 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 379 

Put a tablespoon of cracked ice in each glass in which the 
coffee is served, and drop a spoonful of whipped cream on 
top of each glass of the beverage. 

ICED TEA 
Fill thin glasses full of shaved ice, placing a thin slice of 
lemon on top of each and also one teaspoon of powdered sugar. 
Make a pot of strong tea and pour into the glasses over the 
ice. There will not be any danger of breaking them, as the 
ice cools the tea immediately, and herein lies the secret of the 
delicious flavor obtained. [See illustration, Plate XXIX.] 

SUMMER COCOA 

Mix a heaping teaspoon of cocoa with the same quantity 
of sugar in enough boiling water to dissolve both cocoa and 
sugar. Fill the tumbler with fresh cold milk or with thin 
cream. 

ICED COCOA 

Boil a heaping teaspoon of cocoa in half a pint of boiling 
water for five minutes. Sweeten to taste and add after it is 
cool half a cup of cream. Beat light with an egg beater, and 
serve in tall glasses half filled with powdered ice. 

LEMONADE 
To every glass allow one small lemon, or a large lemon 
to two glasses. Squeeze the juice, add a glass of water for 




Lemon Squeezer 

each glass, and sugar to taste. Put the pitcher on ice and serve 
thoroughly cold, but not with ice in the glass.

THE MAKING OF FRUIT SYRUPS OR SHRUBS 

Appreciation of delicious fruit flavors proves a strong in 

centive to the zealous housewife in providing herself agains 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD '6Sl 

the day when the possibiUt}- of securhig the fruit itself shall 
have passed. 

The making of fruit syrups entails no excess of time, labor, 
or expense, and the syrups are valuable in autumn and winter 
desserts, flavoring home-made ice creams, sherbets, jellies, 
Bavarian and other creams, sauces for puddings, and also 
flavorings for punches and other beverages. But especially 
they are in this division given as serving for wholesome and 
delicious flavoring in a glass of fresh water. In using the 
syrup for such simple beverages, use it precisely as our grand- 
mothers did — have a tumbler of fresh water and stir in a table- 
spoon of the syrup, or "shrub," or "vinegar." as those dames 
of other days used to sa}' in speaking of such sweets. 

CHERRY SYRUP 

Have ripe, juicy acid cherries. Stone them, and one-eighth 
of the stones pound and break. Cook all together till the 
cherry pulp is soft and the juice free. Then squeeze through 
a bag. To every pint of juice add a heaping cup of sugar and 
boil fifteen minutes. Put in bottles or jars and seal for use. 
Keep in a cool, dry place. 

CHOCOLATE SYRUP 

Add to three tablespoons of chocolate one pint of boiling 
water. Let boil up, then add one pint of sugar and boil three 
minutes. When cold add one tablespoon of vanilla. In using 
the s}'rup put two tablespoons in a tumbler, add two table- 
spoons of cracked ice. two tablespoons of whipped cream 
and fill up the glass with milk. Stir well together, and serve. 

CURRANT SHRUB 

Allow a pound of sugar to every pint of currant- juice and 
boil slowly in a porcelain kettle. When it has boiled ten 
minutes set to cool, and when barely lukewarm add a wine- 
glass of pure brandy to every pint of syrup. Bottle and seal 
and keep in a cool, dark, dry place. 



382 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

GRAPE SHRUB 

Crush ripe grapes in a stone jar, and cover with good 
cider vinegar. Cover the jar tight and leave overnight. Every 
day for three or four days stir and press the grapes and the 
vinegar together. Finally, strain through a cheesecloth folded 
three times, and to every three quarts of juice allow five pounds 
of sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Then boil, skim, and 
bottle while very hot. 

LEMON SYRUP 

Grate the yellow off eight fine lemons. Squeeze out the 
juice and put in a porcelain kettle with two cups of water, 
the grated yellow, and four pounds of sugar. Boil all to- 
gether five minutes. Then strain through a bag to get out 
the yellow. Boil up once more, and then bottle and seal 
for use. 

PINEAPPLE SYRUP 

Make a syrup of three pounds of sugar to which has been 
added the white of an egg beaten up and gradually blended 
with a pint of cold water. Let boil and skim until the whole is 
very clear. Put aside to cool. Carefully pare and grate pine- 
apples of the best quality, obtaining three pints of juice, and 
strain the same through a flannel jelly-bag. Put the syrup on 
to boil for about ten minutes, adding gradually at the end of 
this time the pineapple- juice. Let all [come to boil together, 
skim well, and place aside to cool. When thoroughly cold, 
bottle, cork, and seal. 

RASPBERRY SYRUP 

Mash gently freshly gathered raspberries and put into a 
stone crock with half a pint of the best white wine vinegar to 
every pound of fruit. Cover carefully and place on a shelf 
in the cool cellar for a couple of days. At the end of this 
time allow all the juice to drain off thoroughly through a very 
fine puree sieve, without any attempt, however, to wash the 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 383 

pulp of the berries through the sieve ; this may be used for 
making jam. Add to every quart of juice a pound and a half 
of the best granulated sugar, stirring with a wooden spoon 
until the sugar is wholly dissolved, when stir in briskly the 
well-beaten white of an egg to which has been added a table- 
spoon of cold water. During this process the mixture may 
be heated, but not allowed to come to boil, and then set aside 
to cool. Then again put over a more brisk flame of the gas 
range and allow to boil for about five to ten minutes. Skim 
well as the scum rises, and, when removed from the fire, stir 
until cool. When cold, bottle and seal. 

STRAWBERRY SYRUP 

Put on over a moderate flame of the gas range a porcelain- 
lined kettle, containing three pounds of sugar and one and 
a half pints of water. Stir with a wooden spoon until the 
sugar is dissolved. Allow to come to boil, skim, and set aside 
to cool. Mash fresh ripe strawberries and strain through a 
cheesecloth bag to produce three and a half pints, or a scant 
two quarts of juice. Put the kettle containing the boiled sugar 
and water over a flame of greater intensity, and let boil rap- 
idly, watching for the moment when a spoonful of this syrup 
dropped into cold water and rubbed between the thumb and 
finger will form a small ball. Add at once the strawberry 
juice. Let all come up to boil, skim, and set aside to cool. 
When cold, bottle and seal. 

GRAPE-JUICE 

Use only clean, sound, well-ripened but not over-ripe 
grapes. If an ordinary cider mill is at hand, it may be used 
for crushing and pressing, or the grapes may be crushed and 
pressed with the hands. If a light-colored juice is desired, put 
the crushed grapes in a cleanly washed cloth sack and tie up. 
Then either hang up securely and twist it or let two persons 
take hold, one on each end of the sack (Fig. i), and twist 
until the greater part of the juice is expressed. Then gradu- 



384 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

ally heat the juice in a double-boiler or a large stone jar in a 
pan of hot water, so that the juice does not come in direct con- 
tact with the fire, at a temperature of i8o° F. to 200° F. ; 
never above 200° F. It is best to use a thermometer, but if 
there be none at hand, heat the juice until it steams, but do not 
allow it to boil. Put it in a glass or enameled vessel to settle 
for twenty-four hours; carefully drain the juice from the sedi- 
ment, and run it through several thicknesses of clean flannel, 
or a conic filter made from woolen cloth or felt may be used. 
This filter is fixed to a hoop of iron, which can be suspended 
wherever necessary (Fig. 2). After this fill into clean bottles. 
Do not fill entirely, but leave room for the liquid to expand 
when again heated. Fit a thin board over the bottom of an 
ordinary wash boiler, set the filled bottles (ordinary glass 




Fig. I. — Pressing Out Grape-Juice by Hand 

fruit jars are just as good) on it, fill in with water round the 
bottles to within about an inch of the tops, and gradually heat 
until it is about to simmer. Then take the bottles out and 
cork or seal immediately. It is a good idea to take the further 
precaution of sealing the corks over with sealing wax or 
paraffine to prevent mould germs from entering through the 
corks. Should it be desired to make a red juice, heat the 
crushed grapes to not above 200° F., strain through a clean 
cloth or drip bag, as shown in Fig. 3 (no pressure should be 
used), set away to cool and settle, and proceed the same as 
with light-colored juice. Many people do not even go to the 
trouble of letting the juice settle after straining it, but reheat 
and seal it up immediately, simply setting the vessels away in 
a cool place in an upright position where they will be undis-

turbed. The juice is thus allowed to settle, and when wanted 
for use the clear juice is simply taken off the sediment. Any 
person familiar with the process of panning fruit can also pre- 
serve grape juice, for the principles involved are identical. 

One of the leading defects so far found in unfermented 
juice is that much of it is not clear, a condition which very 
much detracts from its otherwise attractive appearance and is 
due to two causes already alluded to. Either the final steriHza- 
tion in bottles has been at a higher temperature than the pre- 
ceding one, or the juice has not been properly filtered or has not 
been filtered at all. In other cases the juice has been sterilized

at sufih a high temperature that it has a disagreeable scorched 
taste. It should be remembered that attempts to sterilize at 
a temperature above 195° F. are dangerous, so far as the flavor 
of the finished product is concerned. 

Another serious mistake is sometimes made by putting the 
juice into bottles so large that much of it becomes spoiled 
before it is used after the bottles are opened. Unfermented 
grape-juice properly made and bottled will keep indefinitely, 
if it is not exposed to the atmosphere or mould germs; but 
when a bottle is once opened it should, like canned goods, be 
used as soon as possible, to keep it from spoiling.

FLAVOR AND QUALITY IN GRAPE-JUICE 

In the making- of unfermented grape-juice a great deal of 
judgment can be displayed and many variations produced so 
as to suit almost any taste by the careful selection of the varie- 
ties of grapes. From the Mission grape, for instance, when 
fully ripe, a juice would be obtained that would be delicate 
and simply sweet, without any other taste ; from the Muscat we 
would get that rich musky flavor found in our leading raisins ; 
in the Concord that sprightly foxy taste so well known; in 
the Catawba or Isabella that fragrance so peculiarly their own, 
and in the lona a pleasing, mild, yet pronounced aroma and 
taste. Thus we might continue along the list. 

Equally as pronounced variations in color can be had, as, 
for instance, almost colorless, yellow, orange, light red, red, 
and a deep purple. 

The richer, sweeter, and better in quality the fruit we use, 
the richer, sweeter, and better will be our unfermented juice. 
If, on the other hand, the fruit is sour, green, and insipid, the 
juice will be likewise. 

USES OF GRAPE-JUICE 

The uses are indeed many. It is used in sickness, con- 
valescence, and good health ; as a preventive, restorative, and 
cure ; by the young, by persons in the prime of life, and by 
those in old age. It is used in churches for sacramental pur- 
poses; at soda fountains as a cool and refreshing drink; in 
homes, at hotels, and at restaurants as a food, as a beverage, 
as a dessert, and in many other ways. When people become 
accustomed to it they rarely give it up. When properly pre- 
pared, unfermented grape- juice can be made to please the eye 
by its color and attractive appearance, the sense of smell by 
its aroma or fragrance, the palate by its pleasant flavor. 

It is food and drink, refreshment and nourishment, all in 
one. Not a by-product, but made from fruit going to waste — 
one of the blessings given us, that some are too careless, others 
too ignorant, to make use of. 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 387 

FOOD VALUE OF GRAPE-JUICE 

The effects of nnfennented grape-juice on the human sys- 
tem have been studied for a number of years, especially at the 
so-called grape cures so long in vogue in Europe. A smaller 
number of investigations have been made in laboratories. 

It is quite generally claimed that using a reasonably large 
amount of un fermented grape-juice with an otherwise suitable 
mixed diet is beneficial and that digestion is improved, intes- 
tinal fermentation diminished, and that gains in body weight 
result. It should not be forgotten that the abundant diet and 
hygienic methods of living practiced at the grape cures play 
an important part, but even taking all this into account it 
seems fair to conclude that some of the good results can be 
directly attributed to the unfermented grape-juice. 

Grape- juice contains the same kinds of nutrients as other 
foods. The percentage of water is high, and thus it resembles 
liquid foods more closely than soHd foods. It is sometimes 
compared with milk, the most common liquid food. It con- 
tains less water than milk, more carbohydrates, and less pro- 
tein, fat, and ash. Carbohydrates, largely present in the form 
of sugar, are the principal nutritive ingredients. It is evident, 
therefore, that grape- juice is essentially an energy-yielding 
food, and may help the body to become fatter, though it can 
not materially assist in building nitrogenous tissue. Sugars in 
moderate amounts are wholesome foods, and grape- juice offers 
such material in a reasonably dilute as well as palatable form. 
Undoubtedly the agreeable flavor increases the appetite, a by 
no means unimportant consideration. 

Besides the receipts given below many more are enumerated, 
such as grape lemonade, grape- juice plain, grape soda 
water, etc. 

GRAPE-JUICE AND EGG 

Put in the bottom of a wineglass two tablespoons of grape- 
juice. Add to this the beaten white of one egg and a little 
chopped ice; sprinkle sugar over the top and serve. This is 
often served in sanitariums. 



388 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

GRAPE NECTAR 
Take the juice of two lemons and one orange, one pint of 
grape-juice, one small cup of sugar, and a pint of water. 
Serve ice cold. If served from a punch bowl, sliced lemon and 
orange add to the appearance. 

GRAPE PUNCH 
Boil together one pound of sugar and half a pint of water 
until it spins a thread. Take from the fire and when cool add 
the juice of six lemons and a quart of grape- juice. Stand 
aside overnight. Serve with plain water, apollinaris, or soda 
water. 

GRAPE WINE 
Stem the grapes, mash thoroughly, and set away for 
twenty-four hours. Then squeeze through a bag. To each 
quart of juice add one quart of water. To every quart of 
the mixture put three pounds of sugar. Set all away in stone 
jars and skim daily till it stops bubbling. Then bottle. 

MY LADY'S WINE 
Take fine grapes of any good variety — the common Con- 
cord, the musky Delaware, the Muscatel, or Diana. Lay them 
in a dampened, strong straining cloth, then fold up the cloth 
in bag shape, lay the bag in an earthen bowl or jar, and 
break the grapes by mashing with a wooden pestle or masher. 
Hang up the bag to drain, and squeeze out all the juice. The 
colored part next the skin carries a pretty color and also has 
much of the fine aroma of the grape. In the matter of sweeten- 
ing be careful not to take too much sugar, but keep the juice so 
it wall retain quite a degree of acidity. Instead of putting 
the sugar directly in the grape- juice, melt it in fresh cold 
water before adding, and let the proportion be one glass of 
sweetened water to two parts grape-juice. Stir all together 
and set on ice. Serve in a pitcher with pieces of ice in the 
pitcher, and pour into small glasses, for instance, lemonade 
glasses. 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 389 

CIDER CUP 

Have in a pitcher cracked ice. Over the ice pour a quart 
of sweet cider and a bottle of club soda. Drop in a few pieces 
of mint, and if you have them a few thin slices of such fruit 
as bananas, apples, pears, etc. Serve at once. 

DANDELION WINE 

Put four quarts of dandelion flowers in a jar, pour over 
them a gallon of boiling water, cover, and let stand for three 
days. Then put over the fire, add the juice and grated yel- 
low of the peel of three oranges and one lemon. Simmer all 
together fifteen minutes. Strain through a thin bag and 
pour over three pounds of sugar in an earthen crock. When 
lukewarm, add three tablespoons of yeast, cover and set 
away in an airy, clean place for from seven to ten days. Then 
skim, strain, and bottle. 

EGGNOG 

Beat the yolk of one egg very light. Add one wineglass 
of whiskey, drop by drop, until the egg is cooked. Next put 
in one tablespoon of rum, one glass of rich milk or cream, 
and lastly the white of the egg beaten to a stiff froth. Nut- 
meg to taste. 

A CHILD'S EGGNOG 

Beat an egg till foamy, add two tablespoons of milk, one 
tablespoon of sugar, a pinch of salt, and a dust of nutmeg, 
and serve in a small wineglass. 

EGG WINE 

In a tumbler break a perfectly fresh egg. Beat till smooth 
and thick. Add a tablespoon of pulverized sugar and then a 
wineglass of port wine. 

If wine is not allowed, fill up the glass with fresh milk 
and put a dash of nutmeg on top. 



390 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

GINGER PUNCH 
Chop one pound of Canton ginger, then add two cups of 
sugar and one pint of water. Boil together fifteen minutes. 
When cool add a cup of orange- juice and strain. This will 
flavor eight or ten cups of water, 

MILK PUNCH 
To a pint of new milk add two tablespoons of sugar. Stir 
and dissolve the sugar in a little of the milk as you add. 
Lastly, stir in two tablespoons of wine. 

MINT JULEP 
The original concoction from which this drink derives its 
name was first invented in the South. It was made of rum 
and brandy undiluted, excepting for a little fine ice. The 
receipt given here can be partaken of without serious results. 
Place one tablespoon each of red raspberry, lemon, orange 
juices and dry sherry in glasses filled with shaved ice. Ar- 
range sprigs of mint in each one and serve with straws. The 
amount given is for small glasses and should be increased 
according to the size of glasses used. If the ice does not dilute 
this mixture quite sufficiently, water can be added. [See il- 
lustration, Plate XXIX.] 

PASSOVER WINE 
Remove from their stems a pound and a half of fine raisins. 
Bruise them with a masher, then chop them coarse, put in an 
earthen crock, add a small sliced lemon, and pour over three 
quarts of fresh water just boiling. Cover the crock in a cool 
place. Next day take a silver spoon and stir all together 
thoroughly. Cover. Repeat the stirring next morning and for 
two following mornings. Then strain through a thick bag and 
bottle or use. 

ROOT BEER 
Root beer is a wholesome drink, as our American fore- 
fathers realized when in the springtime they took their chil- 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 891 

dren into the woods and taught them how to choose roots and 
herbs for it. In those days that was one of the "object-les- 
sons" in Nature. What did they choose in those fields and 
skirting forests? Dandelion and burdock and yellow dock 
roots, the bark of the wild cherry also, and birch bark. They 
had hanging in the garret a bag of hops of the last year's 
picking from the wild vine that ran over tree and fence. 
Then out in the fields again they found sarsaparilla and 
elecampane and spikenard. 

In making the beer wash the roots very clean. Then 
bruise them so that their peculiar virtue or quality will 
readily yield itself. Take an ounce of each ingredient to two 
gallons of water. Be sure the big kettle you boil in is per- 
fectly scoured and clean. Put in the cold water and your roots, 
etc., set over the fire and bring slowly to boil. Simmer for 
about half an hour, adding toward the end and to the pro- 
portion cited above a pound of sugar and twenty to twenty- 
five drops of the oil of sassafras or spruce. Put slowly into 
an earthen crock and cool to lukewarm. Then add the yeast, 
which to the above proportion is eight tablespoons of liquid 
yeast, or a dry yeast cake dissolved in a cup of tepid water. 
Stir in the yeast, cover and set away to ferment. In from 
three to six hours it will be drinkable. It may be kept in 
the jar for immediate drinking, or it may be bottled and the 
working delayed. 

ROYAL SHRUB 

For one glass use three tablespoons of strained red currant- 
juice, two tablespoons of pineapple- juice, produced by cooking 
the fruit in sugar and water. Fill with seltzer water. Add 
one tablespoon of sugar and put a tablespoon of whipped 
cream on top. The fruit juices and seltzer must be ice cold, 
otherwise a tablespoon of shaved ice must be placed in each 
glass. [See illustration, Plate XXX.] 

STRAWBERRY PUNCH 
Make tea by pouring a quart of fresh boiling water on 
three teaspoons of tea. In a punch bowl lay a four-inch square 



392 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

of ice, add the juice of four lemons and one orange, two cups 
of sugar, and a box of small strawberries — the field straw- 
berries are nicest, but if they are not to be had, use the large 
cultivated berries and cut them in quarters or eighths. Now 
pour in your tea, and add two pint bottles of apollinaris, or 
the same amount of clear spring water. Stir about and ladle 
into cups when served. 

SUxMMER ZEPHYR 

Cut a pound and a half of rhubarb into thin slices, cover 
with water, and add one bay leaf and one stick of paper-bark 
cinnamon. Simmer until the rhubarb is tender, then strain. 
Add to the juice one cup of sugar and simmer ten minutes. 
Then add one pint of orange-juice, the juice of three lemons, 
half a cup of preserved ginger-juice. Put shaved ice in a 
pitcher and add the cooled concoction. In each glass place a 
halved strawberry or cherries, or any seasonable fruit. [See 
illustration, Plate XXX.] 

WASSAIL BOWL 

Mix half a pound of brown sugar, one pint of ale, half a 
nutmeg grated, half a teaspoon of ginger, a pinch of cin- 
namon. Heat, but do not boil. Then add half a pint of 
Malaga wine, one quart more of ale, and the grated rind of 
one lemon. Turn into a punchbowl and add as many cored 
and baked apples as there are guests. Serve while hot. [See 
illustration, Plate XXXI.] 

WHIPS 

Sweeten to your taste a pint of thin cream and beat in a 
wineglass of wine and a tablespoon of the extract of lemon. 
Set in a cool place. Beat to a stiff froth the whites of three 
eggs. Stir them rapidly into the cream. Pour in wineglasses 
and serve. [See illustration, Plate XXXI.]

Chicken Broth— Mutton Barley Broth— Blackberry Cordial— Flaxseed Tea or Lemon- 
ade— Hoarhound Cough Syrup— Jelly Water— Slippery Elm Bark Tea 

TO MAKE GRUELS 

GROUND rice flour, cornmeal, oatmeal, arrowroot, and 
other flours are used for gruels — nourishing, healing food 
for stomachs temporarih' disabled and unable to digest any- 
thing more substantial. Mix two tablespoons of the meal or 
flour with cold water till you have a smooth paste. Then stir 
the paste gradually into a pint of water boiling in a double- 
boiler. Stir in slowly so there will be no lumps, and add 
quarter of a teaspoon of salt. Cover and let cook thoroughly 
— if cornmeal or oatmeal three hours at least ; if arrowroot and 
other lighter flours half to three-quarters of an hour. Stir 
occasionally while cooking. 

BARLEY WATER 

To a quart of cold water in a porcelain saucepan allow two 
ounces of mashed pearl barley, two ounces of seeded raisins, 
and the grated rind and juice of a lemon. Cover with an 
earthen plate and boil till the water is reduced one-half. 
Strain and sweeten as the taste demands. Serve either warm 
or cold. 

OLD-FASHIONED BEEF TEA 

Take a piece of lean meat irom the round and free it 
from fat, etc. Cut in small pieces, or have the butcher run 
it through a meat-chopper. Put the meat in an earthen or 
strong glass jar. cover with a quart of cold water, cork or 
seal tight, and set in a pot of cold water. Set over a slow

THE HOME COOK BOOK 



fire, and slowly bring the water in the pot to boil. Move the 
jar now and then so that all the meat in it will have the 
same exposure to heat. Cook gently for two or three hours. 
Strain, season with salt, and serve in a hot bowl with toast 
or breadsticks. 

QUICK BEEF TEA 

Cut the steak into small pieces. Heat it thoroughly in a 
hot saucepan. Squeeze the little pieces one by one in a hot 




Meat Press 

meat press or lemon squeezer, and let the juice flow into a 
bowl which is standing in hot water. Salt to taste. 

CAUDLE 

Beat a fresh egg till it is a froth and stir it with a cup 
of hot gruel. Sweeten to taste, and serve with a dash of nut- 
meg over the top. 



CHICKEN BROTH 

Wash and cut up a full-grown fowl. If you wish a small 
quantity of broth for a sick person, use only the dark meat, 
reserving the white meat of the breast and wings for some 
other small dish. Put the dark meat and broken bones in a 
pot with a quart of water and bring it slowly to boil, and 
boil slowly till cooked to rags. Strain, put back and thicken 
with a tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot stirred smooth 
in a little cold water. Let the flour cook for a few minutes, 
and serve hot, slightly salted. 



GRUELS, BROTHS, CORDIALS 395 

MUTTON BARLEY BROTH 
Take two pounds of the scrag or neck of mutton — using 
that part because it is lean and gives the sweetness of the 
bone to the cooking. Wash it, cut it in bits, put it in the pot 
with two quarts of cold water and bring it slowly to boil. 
When it boils, skim, drop in four ounces of washed pearl 
barley, cover tight, and cook slowly two or three hours. 
Strain, add salt to taste, and serve hot. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL 
Heat the blackberries and press through a sieve. Strain 
the juice through a piece of cheesecloth. Take three pints of 
blackberry juice (it should not be too sweet) and add one 
pound of loaf sugar. Tie up a small bag of whole cinnamon, 
allspice, and a smaller quantity of cloves. Boil together the 
spices and juice twenty minutes slowly. Take off the stove, 
and flavor with California brandy enough to give a strong 
flavor. Bottle and cork tight. 

FLAXSEED TEA OR LEMONADE 
Blanch two tablespoons of flaxseed and then boil two 
hours in a quart of water. Keep close covered while boiling. 
Strain, and add lemon- juice and sugar to taste. 

HOARHOUND COUGH SYRUP 
Make one pint of strong hoarhound tea and strain. Dis- 
solve one ounce of gum arable in hot water, add to the tea. 
Add also one pound of white sugar. Boil to a syrup, skim 
when you take it from the fire, and add one teaspoon of the 
tincture of lobelia. 

JELLY WATER 
Stir a tablespoon of currant jelly in a tumbler of fresh, 
cold water. Drop in a small bit of ice and serve. Other jel- 
lies may be used — as tart apple jelly, grape jelly, barberry 
jelly.

SLIPPERY ELM BARK TEA 

Break the bark in small pieces, rinse quickly, and then 
cover with, fresh, boiling water. Set the bowl in a warm 
place, put a cover upon it, and let the bark steep or infuse 
for half an hour. Then set where it will cool. Sweeten to 
taste, and drop bits of cracked ice in the cup from which it is 
drunk.

MIXING INGREDIENTS ONE AT A TIME 

IF you have ever seen a druggist compound a prescription yon 
noticed that he did not put in two or three things to mix at 
one time with what he had in his mortar, but blended each 
ingredient with what he was making before he added another. 
The same rule has fine results in cooking. If you have three 
or four or five ingredients, do not mix them all at once, but 
stir two together, then add the third, then the fourth, then the 
fifth, stirring each time. 

THE BENEFICENT PAN OF HOT WATER 

A pan of hot water set in the upper oven evens the baking. 
If the oven becomes overheated, the pan filled with cold water 
reduces the temperature in the best possible way. In cooking 
canned vegetables, such as corn, if the saucepan holding the 
corn is set in a pan of hot water, the moderated heat develops 
the taste of the corn and also saves constant watching that the 
corn does not burn. Cereals are best cooked in this way, al- 
though we call the equipment a double-boiler when we use the 
pan of hot water and saucepan for such grains. Finally, a 



a98 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pan of hot water is ever ready for making sauces and gravies, 
and saves the burning both of food and saucepans. 

APPEARANCE OF MEATS 

Good beef is of a bright red color and moderately fat. 

Good mutton is deep red and close-grained. 

Good pork is close-grained, and the rind is smooth and thin. 

TO MAKE TOUGH MEAT TENDER 
A tablespoon of vinegar added to the water in which meats 
or fowls are boiling helps to make the flesh tender. 

WHEN SALT SHOULD BE ADDED IN COOKING 

MEAT 
To put salt on meat when it is raw makes it hard. Do not 
salt your meat till it is almost cooked, at the point where it is 
beginning to get tender. 

ADVANTAGE OF A VARIETY OF SEASONINGS 

A French chef is authority for the statement that the most 
economical cook is a woman who keeps her pantry lavishly 
supplied with all sorts of seasonings, both the cheap and the 
expensive. His argument is that a tough piece of meat, care- 
fully cooked and most alluringly seasoned, may result in a dish 
of even finer flavor than filet of beef at one dollar a pound. 
Among the seasonings which it is good to have constantly 
in stock are bay leaves, whole mace, peppercorns, cloves, all- 
spice, berries, sage, summer savory, thyme, sweet marjoram, 
cayenne, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, kitchen bouquet, 
curry, mushroom, tomato and walnut catsup, celery salt, and, 
I might add, a box of green parsley growing in a sunny win- 
dow of the kitchen. 

This list may sound formidable and expensive to the house- 
wife who places her whole dependence on pepper and salt. 
Experience will teach her, however, that it is cheap. If the 
seasonings are put in tightly closed cans, or bottled, they 



ITEMS OF VALUE 399 

will keep perfectly for almost any length of time. Buy herbs 
— such as sage, bay leaves, etc. — in the smallest quantities, and 
be sure they are fresh. The advantage of having a goodly 
array of seasonings at hand is that you can find a different 
flavor for meat dishes every day. A variety may be given to 
meats which would almost fail to be palatable if they were 
not excellently seasoned. 

HOW TO DRY HERBS 

In drying herbs from your garden, do not cut and dry them 
in the sun. Neither tie them in bunches and hang the bunches 
up under cover. In the first instance, you dry out the herb's 
peculiar oil or virtue. By the second method, the leaves dis- 
color by their own dampness, mould, or fermentation. 

The right way in drying herbs for your kitchen and possible 
medicinal use is to gather them as soon as they begin to open 
their flowers, and to lay them on some netting in a dry shed or 
room where the air will get at them on all sides. Be sure they 
are dry and not moist when you cut or pick them, and free 
them from dirt and decayed leaves. After they are entirely 
dried out, put them in paper bags upon which you have written 
the name of the herb and the date of tieing it up. Hang them 
where the air is dry and there is no chance of their moulding. 

POWDERS OF SAVORY HERBS 
Strip the leaves from the stalks, pound, sift out the 
coarse pieces, put the powder in bottles, and cork tight. Label 
with exactness every bottle. If, for the convenience of instant 
use in gravies, soups, etc., you wish different herbs mixed, 
pound the leaves together when you make them into powders. 
Celery seed, dried lemon-peel, and other spicy things can thus 
be combined and ready for the moment's call. 

ABOUT PEPPER 
Of peppers, the white and cayenne are thought the most 
harmless. In cooking for the sick, or for persons of weak 
digestion, it is well to leave out the pepper altogether. If, 



400 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

however, you think )ou must use some kind, take the more 
harmless white, or cayenne. Black pepper is the dried fruit of 
an East Indian shrub. White pepper comes from the same 
plant and is made from the black pepper by taking off the 
outer scale. It is not so strong as the black, but has a finer 
flavor. Cayenne is a preparation from the dried fruit of cap- 
sicum, and when pure and taken in slight quantities, a stimulant 
to digestion. Paprika is a Hungarian red pepper, and is not 
so strong as the cayenne. 

AS TO SAUCES 

Every cook should know how to make three or four simple 
sauces, for nothing adds more to the appetizing qualities of a 
meat. The French cynic who said that the reason why the 
English considered it bad form to dip their bread in their 
sauces was because they had no sauces worth dipping bread 
into, had a slight foundation for his remark. 

A thick mayonnaise is the basis for sauce tartare. Add 
to it a tablespoon of chopped cucumber pickle, chopped olives, 
a few capers, and a dash of onion-juice, season rather highly, 
and toss lightly. 

A sauce little used in this country is horseradish mixed with 
cream, which is a favorite in Russia, with plain boiled meat. 

RATIO OF RAW TO COOKED CHICKEN 

Thirteen pounds of raw chicken make three quarts of cooked 
chicken — enough to serve thirty people. One quart of chicken 
salad serves eight people liberally. 

MILK FOR CUSTARD 

The success of a custard is much increased if the milk Is 
scalded and cooled before being made into the custard. 

KEEPING MILK AND BUTTER 

The air where milk and butter stand should be the purest. 
Both milk and butter absorb smells, and they will be con- 



ITEMS OF VALUE 401 

taminated and unwholesome, and also taste of any bad air to 
which they are subject. Milk readily absorbs and develops 
bacteria of the air. No article of food requires more care 
and concern in its wholesome keeping. 

In traveling in New Mexico I once saw a milk room open- 
ing into the cows' stables ! There, surrounded by the noxious 
air, the milk stood while the cream rose. The cream and milk 
tasted of the stable disgustingly and were unusable except to 
the strong stomachs of the people who lived under such 
conditions. 

BUTTER PADDLES 

The little paddles of hollywood used for making butter 



Holly Butter Paddles 

into balls for table use should be scrubbed, rinsed, sunned, and 
laid in the ice-box till their next use. 

TO HELP IN WHIPPING CREAM 
If the cream seems thin, add a pinch of finely powdered 
gum-arabic mixed with double its quantity of powdered sugar. 

COLD EGGS FOR BEATING 
The colder eggs are the sooner you can beat them to a froth. 

TO CHOOSE MACARONI 
The best macaroni is yellowish in color, should not break 
easily while cooking, and in cooking swells to three or four 
times it size when dry. 

RADISHES WITH RICE 
It is a gastronomic fact that with rice something should 
be eaten that offers a little resistance to digestion. People 



402 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

who eat rice daily are aware of this. The Chinese, for in- 
stance, takes radishes with his rice. 

WHEN PIES OVERFLOW 

Fruit pies made from juicy fruits sometimes lose half their 
finest part by the juice overflowing, or pushing through the 
crust where upper and under crusts meet. The escaping juice, 
moreover, soaks the crust. Our grandmothers overcame the 
difficulty by tieing round the pie when ready to bake a strip of 
stifif damp linen. 

TO PREVENT SOGGY CRUST 

In making the filling for a cocoanut or custard pie, there 
will be less chance of having a soggy crust if the milk is brought 
to the scalding point and the eggs, sugar, and seasonings stirred 
in before putting in the crust. This will shorten the time of 
cooking by half. 

DO NOT USE MELTED BUTTER IN CAKE 
In cakemaking, do not melt butter ; it spoils the cake. 

TO PREVENT HASTY BROWNING 

Keep in a pantry drawer sheets of clean brown paper to 
slip over a dish that is browning too rapidly. A sheet of 
asbestos paper, or of oiled or greased paper, may be used in 
the same way and will serve the purpose quickly. 

FRYING DOUGHNUTS 

In the first place, have the lard hot and quiet, not boiling 
and bubbling. Drop in the doughnuts. They will disappear a 
second and then rise to the top. Have a long fork and turn 
them, not piercing, while they cook. Do not let them soak 
fat, as they do while lying cooking only on one side, or in a 
fat not hot enough. When they are browned all round, pick 
them up with the fork, which does not take so much of the 
fat as a skimmer, and lay in a colander standing near in a 



ITEMS OF VALUE 403 

warm place and lined with brown paper. The warmth from 
the colander keeps the fat on the cakes melted and allows 
the brown paper to absorb it. 

TO BROWN BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITHOUT 

MOLASSES 
Using molasses to make buckwheat cakes brown you in- 
troduce a sweetening into the cakes. This many people dislike. 
It is well to know you can get the brown color by putting a 
handful of Indian meal in the batter. The meal will also help 
make the cakes light, while the tendency of molasses is to make 
them heavy. 

USES OF A PINCH OF SALT 
It is said that a pinch of salt added to a pot of coffee or of 

tea just before pouring will increase the natural aroma of the 

dish. 

A pinch of salt added to a dish too sweet will help conceal 

the sweetness. 

BREAD AND CRACKER CRUMBS 
It is sound economy to have a glass jar with a tight cover 
for rolled and crisp cracker or bread crumbs. Into it you 
can drop the powdered crumbs which )'0U make from crusts 
and scraps of bread and crackers, and have always on hand 
the crumbs so necessary in frying, in cooking meats, vegetables, 
cheese, pudding, and other dishes. 

TO SAVE AFTER SCORCHING 
If milk scorches — it is best to heat it in a double-boiler, 
but sometimes for haste it is set immediately over the 
fire — lift the saucepan off the fire and set it in a pan of 
cold water till the bottom of the saucepan is cool. Then pour 
oft* the milk, keeping back the scorched part clinging to the 
bottom of the saucepan. 

This same method will be found effective in the scorching 
of vegetables, meats, and all articles of food. 



404 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

TO DESTROY SIVIELL OF COOKING CABBAGE, ETC. 

In cooking cabbage or anything having strong odors, set on 
the back of the stove a granite cup one quarter full of vinegar. 
Keep this hot. Do not let it boil, or burn, and it will absorb 
all the odor. 

A piece of coal put in the pot when cabbage or cauliflower 
is boiling destro3's all unpleasant smell through the house. 

Burned sugar is a deodorizer. Sprinkle the sugar on a few 
live coals on a shovel and leave in the room for five minutes. 

PORCELAIN FOR ACIDS 

In cooking fruit, or in using any acid preparation in cook- 
ing, be sure your saucepans and kettles are porcelain or en- 
ameled or earthenware. If you use metal ware you run the risk 
of having the acid of the fruits combine with the metals and 
form deadly poisons. All fruits and vegetables holding any 
acid whatever should be cooked in porcelain, earthenware, or 
best enameled saucepans and kettles. Never cook anything 

ACID IN TIN OR COPPER. 

TO CLEAN DECANTERS AND CRUETS 

Such glassware as decanters, carafes, and vinegar cruets 
sometimes become so discolored that shot or fine charcoal will 
not wash them clean. Try this remedy, which has worked 
satisfactorily: Fill the bottle with finely chopped potato skins. 
Cork tight, and let the bottle stand for three days. Empty 
and rinse thoroughly. 

ABOUT PLANKING BOARDS 

A board for planking fish should be made of hard, well- 
planed wood, either hickory or oak. If it is to be used in a gas 
stove, measure the broiling chamber before ordering the plank. 
Have it one inch smaller than the oven, to allow of its being 
easily slipped in and out. Have the board about four inches 
narrower than its length, and slightly rounded, ironing board 



ITEMS OF VALUE 405 

fashion, at one end, to accommodate the tail of the fish. The 
older and blacker the board becomes the finer flavor it imparts 
to a fish. Never wash it with soap ; scrub with a brush and 
boiling water immediately on removing- the plank from the 
table. Occasionally give it a good rub with sandpaper. 

TO KEEP PEARS FOR WINTER USE 

Lay the pears on a shelf in a dry, cool place. Set them 
stems up and so far apart that they do not touch one another. 
Allow the air to move freely in the room in which they lie. 
Layers of paper or of straw make a soft bed, but the less the 
pear touches the shelf or resting-place the better for its 
keeping. 

TO PACK EGGS 

Put into a butter firkin a thick layer of coarse dry salt, then 
a layer of eggs, with the small end down, another layer of salt, 
then eggs, and so on until the firkin is full. Cover and keep 
in a dry place. These eggs will keep put up in this way almost 
any length of time. 

TO MAKE BREAD CLOTHS 

Cloths for breadmaking, to put over sponge at night to 
preserve its even temperature, and to lay over rising bread to 
save it from chill, are nicely made by taking a good quality of 
cheesecloth, folding double, thus making a square of about 
three-quarters of a yard or a yard, and laying a thin layer of 
cotton batting in between. Quilt the batting in coarse quilt- 
ings so that it will not lose its place in the frequent washings 
the cloths must have. 

PAPER ON PANTRY SHELVES 

There used to be an old custom — which was thought a good 
one by some housekeepers — of covering pantry shelves with 
paper. Indeed, there were fancy-colored papers with lace bor- 
ders made for such use. But the sanitary housekeeper and 



406 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

cook of the present clay who places cleanliness and simplicity 
before all else, has seen that these paper-covered shelves har- 
bored dirt and gave hiding-places for dust. She has, therefore, 
abolished the paper. Pantry shelves should be painted a fair 
white, and if there are several coats of paint, so much the 
easier to wash them off clean. The utensils and dishes upon a 
well-painted shelf can be moved about easily, and the shelf 
often wiped with a cloth wrung out of hot water — this quite 
aside from the scrubbing of regular scrubbing days. 

THE USE OF WINE 

This book does not advise or encourage the use of wine 
in simple, every-day cooking. Now and then some of our 
receipts include it as a flavoring. But it may always be 
omitted. We certainly advise against its common use. Its 
constant presence may stimulate a depraved or morbid appetite 
for drink.

FOREWORD 

AN excellent housewife once gave, as a part of her receipt 
for making gooseberry pie, the following direction : "Put 
in all the sugar your conscience allows; then shut your eyes 
and add a double handful." 

In compiling the present work the editor's conscience has 
been strained and her eyes have been closed in an opposite 
process. She had collected far more receipts than could pos- 
sibly appear in a single volume even of the generous size per- 
mitted by the plan of The Household Library. By various 
siftings, such as the elimination of obvious receipts, of alterna- 
tive ones, of those which would be infrequently used, of those 
requiring too costly materials for the average housewife, of 
rich dishes dangerously near the line of unhealthfulness, the 
material in hand was greatly reduced, yet not to the required 
dimensions. A Procrustean method had to be adopted. So 
the editor shut her eyes and took out not one handful, but a 
number of handfuls, of tried and approved receipts, each as 
good as the ones that remained, though no better than these. 
Therefore, if any reader finds that a favorite dish of hers is 
unrepresented in the work, let her blame the exigencies of 
publication rather than the intention of the editor. 

Under these circumstances space was considered too valu- 
able even for an index. So, as far as possible, the work was 
made self-indexing. Frequent chapters were formed to per- 
mit ready reference, and within each chapter the receipts were 



12 FOREWORD 

arranged, first, according to logical and practical relation, and 
then alphabetically. For example, in the chapter on "Candies,"' 
the general receipt for "Fondant" is followed by special receipts 
in which fondant is an ingredient, these being arranged in 
alphabetical order. 

Thanks are due the Department of Domestic Science of 
Teachers' College, Columbia University, for the use of a 
photograph of tlie laboratory and of twelve photographs 
of uncooked meat. 

Adcnowledgment is also made "The Home Science Maga- 
zine" for the use of the illustration, "Three Salted Fish."

FRUIT AND SHELLFISH COCKTAILS 

Banana and Pineapple ■Chcnryand Orani^e— Peach— Raspberry and Currant— Strawberry 

and Grapefruit— Strawberry and Orange— Clam— Oyster, Plain— Oyster 

with Sherry— Hot Oyster— Oysters in Grapefruit Baskets 

SINCE cocktails sometimes take the place of soup, a few 
of the fruit and shellfish variety are here introduced. 
They are especially fitted for warm weather, when hot soup 
is not agreeable to the palate. 

BANANA AND PINEAPPLE COCKTAIL 

Cut in thin round slices three ripe bananas. Add the 
juice and pulp of one grated pineapple, the juice of two 
oranges and one lemon. Sweeten to taste. Guard against 
getting the dish too sweet. Set to cool in the ice-box, and 
serve with a little shaved ice or a small piece of ice dropped 
in each glass. 

See also "Banana Salad" on page 150, and "Pineapple 
Salad" on page 157, which may be used for cocktails. 

CHERRY AND ORANGE COCKTAIL 

Cherries canned, with or without tlie pit, may be treated 
with orange-juice, sweetened and served as fruit cocktails. 
Canned strawberries, peaches, tamarinds, and other fruits 
may be served in the same way as cherries. 

PEACH COCKTAIL 

Peel and cut fine ripe peaches m small pieces. Make a 
strong lemonade by mixing lemon- juice with water which 



14 THE HOME COOKBOOK 

has dissolved the sweetening. Lay a heaping tablespoon 
of the cut peaches in a lemonade glass, cover them with the 
strong lemonade, lay on a tablespoon of shaved ice and serve. 

RASPBERRY AND CURRANT COCKTAIL 

Lay a heaping tablespoon of red or black raspberries with 
a small piece of ice in the bottom of a lemonade glass. Cover 
with the juice of currants sweetened a little. To get the 
juice of the currants put them in an earthen bowl and then 
crush them with a pestle. Put the waste in a bag which has 
been wet and wrung and squeeze the juice through. 

STRAWBERRY AND GRAPEFRUIT COCKTAIL 

Cut the grapefruit in two, and with a spoon and fork dig 
out the pulp. Be careful not to take the inner skin with the 
pulp. Cut out the inner skin so that you will have the halves 
of the fruit in the shape of cups. Mix in equal proportions 
the pulp of the grapefruit and ripe strawberries. Sugar to 
your taste, keeping it rather sour, and set in a cool place till 
you are ready to serve it. Set the cup skins of the grape- 
fruit where they will be cool. When you serve, pile the 
cups with the mixed strawberries and pulp, lay in the centre 
a dessertspoon of ice. One grapefruit makes two portions. 

STRAWBERRY AND ORANGE COCKTAIL 

In a punch, lemonade, or other glass put half a dozen 
strawberries. Squeeze over them the juice of an orange. 
Add a dessertspoon of powdered sugar and the same quantity 
of ice, and serve. Each glass should be made separately. The 
strawberries and oranges may be prepared and set in a cool 
place till needed. Then add the sugar and ice. 

See also "Orange Salad" on page 156, which may be used 
as a cocktail. 

CLAM COCKTAIL 

Have twelve small clams opened and free from pieces of 
shell and from sand. Chill them on ice. Then add two 



FRUIT AND SHELLFISH COCKTAILS Ifi 

tablespoons of catsup, a teaspoon of horseradish, a teaspoon of 
minced onion, three shakes of Tabasco sauce, and a little 
lemon-juice or vinegar. This makes two portions, or cocktails. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL, PLAIN 

In a wineglass put six small oysters and add a teaspoon 
of Worcestershire sauce, a dessertspoon of catsup, two drops 
of Tabasco sauce, and three or four drops of lemon-juice or 
vinegar. This is one portion, or cocktail. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL WITH SHERRY 

Be sore tiie glass is cold before beginning. Put in the 
glass six 03rsters, and over them a dash of salt, then pour one 
tablespoon 'of sherry over the oysters, measuring the wine 
carefully. Serve with two small, plain crackers. 

HOT OYSTER COCKTAIL 

Open a dozen medium-sized Blue Point oysters, and catch 
their liquor in an eartlien saucepan or chafing-dish. Set the 
dish to heat, and as soon as the liquor begins to bubble take 
off the scum and mix in two tablespoons of minced celery, and 
add a little salt, a dash of red pepper, and two tablespoons of 
butter. When these ingredients are all hot and well blended 
slip in the oysters. Watch closely until their edges begin to 
curl, and then add a sherry glass of sherry. Stir well together 
and serve in hot soup plates. 

OYSTERS IN GRAPEFRUIT BASKETS 

Cut grapefruit so as to form a one-side handle basket. 
Scoop out the pulp and clip edge into points with scissors. 
Place eight small oysters in each basket and cover them with 
a sauce made of equal portions of lemon- juice, grated horse- 
radish, tomato catsup, and speck mustard. Place on shaved 
ice on plate and serve. [See illustration, Plate I.]

CROUTONS AND SOUP-BALLS 

A Soap Bouquet— Bread Fingers— Bread-and-Cheese Bnlli rmntnnn rtirryBaHi Hffff 
Balls— Bgg-and-Cheeie Balla— Meat BaU»— Winter Suet Balls 

A SOUP BOUQUET 

TO season soup with a soup bouquet, as it is called, which is 
another way of naming a bunch of sweet herbs, tie together 
with a white thread a small sprig of sage, a sprig of summer 
savory and thyme and parsley and a bay leaf. Drop the bunch 
into the soup you want flavored and let it cook in the soup 
for half an hour, if you have a moderate quantity of soup, 
and less time if you have less soup. The delicacy of the herbs 
is destroyed by long cooking, and by following that method 
you lose what you sought in making the bouquet. 

BREAD FINGERS FOR SOUP 

Cut off the crusts of stale slices of bread, cut the bread 
in fingers about four inches long and three-quarters of an 
inch wide, lay in a dripping-pan and toast a golden brown 
in a moderate oven. 

BREAD-AND-CHEESE BALLS FOR SOUP 

Mix half a cup of fine soft breadcrumbs with half a cup 
of soft American cheese and half a teaspoon of salt and a dash 
of cayenne. When thoroughly blended stir to a paste with an 
uncooked egg. Form into small balls, not larger than a 
hickory-nut, drop into boiling water and cook two minutes and 
then transfer to the soup. Or if you don't mind the balls 
coloring a clear soup, drop direct into the soup two minutes 
before serving. 



CROUTONS AND SOUP-BALLS 17 

CROUTONS FOR SOUP 

Take slices a third of an inch thick of stale bread, cut off 
the crusts, butter, and then cut in half-inch squares, or in 
pieces the size of a cent, or in triangles, diamonds, or other 
fancy shapes. Put in a dripping-pan in a moderate upper 
oven and toast a light brown. Put four or five in a plate of 
soup when serving. 

Another way to make them is to cut and then to fry a 
light brown in hot fat, or to put them in a frying-pan with a 
little butter and brown. 

CURRY BALLS FOR SOUP 

Mix half a cup of fine soft breadcrumbs with the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs, a teaspoon of curry powder and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Pound well together and then stir 
in a raw egg to form a paste and hold it together. Form into 
small balls not larger than a hickory-nut and drop into the 
boiling soup two minutes before serving. 

EGG BALLS FOR SOUP 

Boil five eggs till hard — that is, about twenty minutes — 
and then put them in cold water. Peel, and cut the whites 
in rings. Mash the yolks with the yolks of two raw eggs, 
beating the pulverized hard yolks well into the raw yolks. 
Add half a teaspoon of salt, a few drops of onion-juice, and a 
dash of cayenne. Form into small balls like marbles and 
drop into boiling soup two minutes before the soup is taken 
off the fire. Add also the rings made from the whites of the 
eggs. 

EGG-AND-CHEESE BALLS FOR SOUP 

Mash together the yolks of five hard-boiled eggs and two 
tablespoons of soft American cheese. Add half a tablespoon 
of salt and a pinch of cayenne. Blend these all together by 
mixing in the uncooked whites of two eggs. Form the paste 
into small balls and drop gently into boiling soup three minutes 
before serving. 



18 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

MEAT BALLS FOR SOUP 

Any cold cooked meat may be used for soup balls, but 
veal is preferred as b^ing most delicate. To one cup of 
minced meat add half a cup of breadcrumbs, two tablespoons 
of minced parsley, a tablespoon of thyme or sweet marjoram, 
and salt and pepper to taste. An egg is to hold these ingre- 
dients together, and it should be beaten a little and used as a 
wetting, mixing in till the meat is moist and pasty. Form 
into balls the size of a hickory-nut, or a little larger, and 
lower gently in the soup and boil two minutes before taking 
the soup from the stove. 

WINTER SUET BALLS FOR SOUP 

Have half a cup of suet chopped fine and freed from 
skin. To this add half a teaspoon of salt, pepper as you 
wish, and half a cup of flour. Mix and add ice-water, a 
few drops at a time, while you stir. When you have a stiff 
paste, not wet and soggy, but merely sticking together, form 
in little balls like small marbles, drop in boiling soup and cook 
from five to seven minutes before serving.

ASPARAGUS SOUP 

BOIL until tender in a quart and a quarter of water aspar- 
agus cut in pieces an inch in length and filling a quart 
measure and a quarter over. When the asparagus is cooked 
tender reserve a cup of it, putting the finest tips in the cup. 
Rub the remainder of the asparagus through a colander or sieve 
and put back in the water in which it boiled. Heat one pint 
of milk or, if you prefer it, cream, and pour over one table- 
spoon of butter and one tablespoon of flour, which have been 
well mixed together. Let come to boil, add the asparagus and 
its water, and the cup of asparagus tips. Boil up once more, 
salt, and serve with toasted bread cut in dice floating on top. 

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS 

Boil till tender in enough water to half cover it asparagus 
of the quantity called a '^bunch." When done put the aspar- 
agus through a colander. Melt a heaping tablespoon of butter 
in a saucepan, adding gradually two heaping tablespoons of 
flour. When these are blended pour in slowly, stirring all the 
time, the hot water in which the asparagus was boiled. Let 



20 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

come to boil, stir in the asparagus pulp and then a pint of 
cream and half a pint of milk. Add salt and a dash of cayenne 
as it boils up, and serve with croutons. 

BEAN SOUP 

Soak a quart of small white beans overnight. Put them 
into two quarts of water to which you have added two tea- 
spoons of soda. Let them boil five minutes, by which time the 
outer skin of the beans is loosened. Pour ofi the water from 
the beans and rub them between the hands in cold water till 
the hard outer skins are off. Next put the beans in cold water, 
enough to cover and rise above them, and boil about three 
hours or till quite soft, adding water if necessary. Twenty 
minutes before serving stir in rich milk so that the beans 
break by the stirring and add the milk till you have the soup 
of the thickness you want. Put in salt and butter and pepper 
to taste. Boil up the soup a couple of times, and serve with 
croutons or sippets of bread. 

BLACK BEAN SOUP 

Wash and soak overnight in cold water a pint of black 
curtle beans. Next morning drop the beans in a quart and a 
cup of boiling water, cover the saucepan tight and cook slowly 
two hours and a half or until the beans are tender. Put them 
through a sieve, add a quart of soup stock, a teaspoon of salt, 
and pepper to taste, set on the stove and bring to boil. Serve 
with a thin slice of lemon and a thin slice of hard-boiled egg 
in each plate. 

LIMA BEAN SOUP 

Soak a cup of dried Lima beans overnight. Next morning 
put the beans in two quarts of fresh water over the fire and 
cook until you can put them through a colander or sieve. 
Fry till brown two onions in two tablespoons of butter. When 
the onions are brown add two tablespoons of flour. Brown

cover with cold water and set over the fire. Let come slowly 
to boil and then skim and set on the back part of the stove, 
where it will merely simmer all day. Be sure it is tightly 
covered. At evening pour it in an earthen jar, and the next 
day take off the fat and strain the soup through a colander. 
Chop fine two onions, a small carrot, or half a large one, two 
stalks of celery, and one tomato. Also mince a pound of lean 
beef, and with this mix the whites of three eggs and their 
shells. Mix the meat and vegetables and put to the soup.

CHICKEN GUMBO 

A ST. LOUIS RECEIPT 

Cut Up one chicken, severing all the joints. Place it in a 
soup kettle on the back of the stove, and cook very slowly, 
adding one slice of pickled pork, about four inches long, and 
half a pound or a little more of fresh lean beef. Season highly 
with pepper and salt. Chop very fine one good-sized onion and 
one garlic seed. Mash together one heaping teaspoon of lard 
and one heaping teaspoon of flour. Add this to the onion and 
garlic and fry a nice brown. This done, pour over it one pint 
of hot water. Add one bunch of parsley, chopped fine. Cook 
slowly on the back of the stove one hour. One hour before 
dinner add the browned onion to the chicken and enough more 
hot water to stand about two inches above the chicken. Cook 
slowly. Have the chicken very tender. When ready to serve, 
take the kettle from the fire and stir in finely sifted fil6 until 
it begins to rope, which you will discover by pouring it from 
a spoon. It is then ready to serve at once. Two handfuls of 
fil6 are generally enough. Add more if needed. Fil6 is pul- 
verized sassafras leaves. If you have no 616, okra is very good. 
By some it is preferred. In case of using okra, take either the 
dried or the fresh. Half a pint of the dried will be sufficient ; 
of the fresh, one pint. Slice it quite thin. Okra should be 
added long enough before the soup is done to cook it tender, 
which will be about half an hour. To serve have ready hot 
boiled rice. As each plate of soup is served place a tablespoon 
of rice in the centre. Ladle the chicken soup over it. 

CLAM CHOWDER 

Fry in a pot five slices of fat pork till the fat is half

clams, throw it away, and put the soft parts in a bowl. Add 
three cups of milk to the liquor of the clams, and stir in a 
tablespoon of butter blended with a tablespoon of flour. When 
the flour has slightly thickened the soup, drop in the soft part 
of the clams. Boil up, add salt, and also a dash of cayenne 
if your taste wishes, and serve hot. 

CLEAR SOUP

and boil up once more. Each time skim thoroughly. Have 
scraped a small carrot and two small onions. Stick eight 
cloves in the onions, and with the jcarrot drop in the soup. 
Let boil slowly, and add a teaspoon of celery seed, two blades 
of mace, and a few bits of parsley. When the onions are 
tender clear through, strain the soup through a bag. Put 
back in the kettle and stir in the well-beaten whites of two 
eggs. Boil until the eggs gather, stir in a teaspoon of burned 
sugar to give a delicate brown color, and strain till the soup 
is clear. Serve hot.

just long enough to thicken. It is then ready to serve. 

MAIGRE SOUP 

Take whatever tops you have from a bunch of celery, cut 
in small pieces and put in a saucepan with a couple of onions 
and four good-sized potatoes, all sliced. Pour on two quarts 
of water, cover tight and boil for an hour. Stir and beat well 
together, add a piece of butter the size of an tgg, salt to taste,

ing the crab thoroughly. Add two minced cloves of garlic 
and one teaspoon of minced parsley. Serve with rice. 

The same rule serves for plain okra g^mbo— leaving out 
the crab meat. Minced halibut makes a fine substitute for 
crab. The fish must be used raw. 

OKRA GUMBO 

Follow the directions for "Gumbo with Crabs," omitting 
the crab meat. 

ONION CREAM SOUP 

Slice a dozen small white onions and fry them brown in a 
tablespoon of butter or drippings. Add a quart of boiling 
water, ifover tight, and let the onions cook half an hour. Then 
add a pint of fresh milk or cream, salt and pepper to taste, 
and thicken with three tablespoons of flour worked smooth

merely a cup of whipped cream. Boil up once and serve hot 
with bread sticks or with toast. 

OXTAIL SOUP 

Separate the tail at the joints and soak in cold water an 
hour. In three tablespoons of butter or drippings fry three

bouquet, or merely salt, and simmer, tightly covered, till 
needed. Serve with bread sticks or with sippets. 

OYSTER BOUILLON 

Drain from their own liquor and chop fine two dozen large 
oysters. Put them to heat slowly in a double-boiler. When 
they have become hot put through a sieve and press from 
them all their juice. The liquor you get under the sieve add 
to the liquor you get by first draining the oysters, land set on 
the fire in an earthen saucepan. Stir in the beaten white of 
an egg and let come to boil. Then strain through a cheese- 
It^loth bag, add salt and pepper, and the same quantity of hot 
creamy milk as you have oyster liquor. Serve hot with 
croutons or bread fingers. 

OYSTER GUMBO 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH

of beef drippings and two tablespoons of flour. Stir con- 
stantly until brown. Add one large minced onion, a good 
pinch of th3mie, and one good-sized minced sweet pepper 
without its seed. When these become quite brown add two 
tablespoons of canned tomatoes. Stir continually till the whole 
is well cooked, adding a little tomato-juice to keep from burn- 
ing. Add one quart of juice from which you have drained 
the oysters that go with the juice. Also one clove of minced 
garlic, one teaspoon of minced parsley, salt to taste, and 
a dash of cayenne pepper. Allow the soup to boil five minutes.

OYSTER STEW 

Take one quart of nice oysters. Pour them into a colander 
and set over a pan to drain. Look over the oysters to see 
that there are no shells with them. Put into a medium-sized 
granite preserving kettle one pint of milk and one pint and a 
quarter of water. To this add five soda crackers rolled very 
fine, one rather heaping teaspoon of salt, and a dash of pepper. 
Now add the liquor that was drained from the oysters. Set 
the kettle on the stove. Stir occasionally, and as soon 
as the milk boils up pour in the oysters, which will cool 
the milk. The moment it boils up again take at once 
from the fire, and set where it will keep hot without 
boiling. Add one tablespoon of butter and stir when melted. 
Let stand ten minutes before serving. The flavor improves 
by standing a short time. Have the soup plates hot, and 
break one soda cracker into each plate separately. Ladle the 
oysters over the crackers and serve. 

PEA-AND-POTATO SOUP 

Boil one pint of split peas till soft. Boil also till tender a 
pint and a half of sliced potatoes, together with one good- 
sized onion sliced thin. Put the soft peas and the tender pota- 
toes and onion through a colander, add water till you have the 
thickness you want your soup to be, salt to taste, boil up once 
more, stir in a piece of butter, and serve with little squares of 
toasted bread — ^sippets or croutons — ^floating in each plate. 

SPLIT PEA SOUP 

Soak overnight a cup of split peas. Next morning drain 
and put in a pot with two quarts of cold water. If you have 
bones of ham, fowl, or of beef or mutton, put them in to 
increase the tastiness of the soup. G>ver tight, and cook 
slowly till the peas are soft, which will probably be in three 
hours. When soft put through a sieve. Add a pint or more 
of milk, and set over the fire again. Stir in a heaping table- 
spoon of butter and a heaping tablespoon of flour blended to- 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 35 

gether, add a tablespoon of salt and a dash of pepper, and also, 
if your taste allows it, a minced onion or onion-juice. If the 
soup seems too thick, thin with a little milk or cream. 

POT AU FEU 

THE NATIONAL DISH OF FRANCE 

The French cook this dish of theirs, which is so tasty and 
so nourishing, in an earthen pot or pipkin, a pot with a lid 
that fits close, cooks slowly, and does not hurry the meat. 
But with a good iron pot the care of the American housewife 
Elan bring about as wholesome and tasty a dish. The pot must 
surely have a close-fitting cover to hold in the steam and the 
savor of the meat. And the fire must be slow— or the cooking 
must, must, must. 

This soup or stew is made afresh once or twice a week by 
every family in France who can afford to buy the meat for it. 
The families who can afford to live well eat it for its own 
merit; those who can not afford the most substantial foods 
every day take it in between their vegetable soups to keep up 
their strength and nourish the body in full force. It has been 
said that the temperance of Frenchmen is due to the delicious 
preparation of this dish by their wives. They eat at dinner of 
the nourishing pot au feu, followed by a vegetable salad or 
by fruit, and they have had a "square" meal. Their hunger 
is satisfied. A craving for something more does not lead them 
to a dram of whiskey, as has happened in unnumbered in- 
stances in our country. Men have sometimes become drunk- 
ards because their body is starved by poor cooking at home — 
their bodies crave substantial food, and they ignorantly stifle 
the craving with the poison of liquor. Let us have more of 
the French pot au feu. 

The French housewife begins to make this great dish of 
her people soon after breakfast on the day it is to be eaten. 
She puts the various things that go to make it gradually into 
the pot, attends to it throughout the day, keeps it simmering 
over a small fire, and when the good man comes in at night 
has it smoking hot, ready to dish in a hot bowl or deep platter.

86 THB HOME COOK BOOK 

On the first day she commonly serves it with slices of bread 
soaked in it; on the second day with rice, vermiceUi, matsa- 
roni, etc. 

And one more word as to the French housewife's process 
of making before we give full directions. In the way she 
goes at it, a great French cook says, she shows the most 
truly scientific knowledge. She first lays the meat in her pot 
and pours cold water to it in the proportion of about two 
quarts of water to three pounds of beef. She then places it 
upon the fire, where it becomes slowly, very slowly, hot. In 
this slow heating the heat enlarges the fibre of the meat, dis- 
solves the albuminoids and gelatinoids which it contains, and 
diffuses the savory or extractive parts of the meat through the 
water. From this one fact of bringing to boil slowly and 
boiling in the gentlest manner, a tasty, nutritious dish is ob- 
tained. If, however, the housewife had heated the water 
quickly the albumen of the meat would have been coagulated, 
the fibres shrunk, the savory parts not diffused, and the result 
would have been tasteless broth and tough, hard meat 
Housewives, do remember this difference between slow 
heating and boiling and quick heating and boiling of 
meats. 

But now as to what to put into the dish. Let us tell it 
in homely, English terms. Cut up six pounds of good fresh 
beef — ^the shin or the leg or the neck will do — ^and over it pour 
four quarts of water. Set over the fire, skim as it warms and 
simmers, and add half a pound of liver cut in small pieces, 
a teaspoon of salt, and a dash of black pepper. Slice or cut 
in cubes two or three large carrots and add. Next put in four 
turnips peeled and quartered, then eight small onions peeled 
and sliced, two of them roasted, or all fried brown. Next a 
parsnip, split and sUced, with the pith removed, half a dozen 
potatoes peeled and quartered, and a head of celery cut in 
small pieces. Add also a bunch of sweet herbs cut small. 
Now if you have not all these vegetables take what you 
have or can get Tomatoes are always an addition. Let 
the whole boil slowly and steadily five or six hours. In fact. 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 87 

keep it just simmering, bubbling lazily. Serve as above 
indicated. 

In the directions given above the meat is cut up in pieces. 
This dish is also made with the beef cut in one large piece 
irom the rump. When in one piece the beef is tied about with 
twine to keep it from boiling to pieces, but the making of the 
dish remains the same. Naturally you will then have a soup — 
it will not be so thick as with the meat cut in small pieces — 
and you will have a large piece of boiled beef, which you slice 
on a platter and serve with horseradish or any piquant sauce. 
If in making this dish you have beefsteak bones, chicken 
head or legs, add them, and their natural oils and flavors 
will increase the nourishing quality and tastiness of your 
dish. 

Instead of beef you may use mutton, venison, or bufiEalo. 

POTATO SOUP 

Boil in two quarts of water two small onions, four large 
or seven small potatoes, two or three stalks of celery cut in 
small pieces, and a sprig of thyme or parsley. When well 
cooked pass through a sieve and put back in the kettle. Mix 
smooth a tablespoon of flour and a piece of butter the size of 
an egg, stir up with a little of the hot soup and pour gradually 
into the soup. As it boils and thickens, season with salt and 
pepper to your taste. Lastly, stir in a cup or more of whipped 
cream and serve at once. 

RICE CREAM SOUP 

Wash and cook for ten minutes in a quart of boiling water 
half a cup of rice. Drain the rice, put it in a quart of milk 
in a double-boiler, cover tight and cook till soft, which will 
be in about twenty-five minutes. Fry two small onions in a 
tablespoon of butter. Put the rice and the onions through a 
sieve or colander, set them again to heat in the double-boiler, 
season to your taste with salt, cayenne, and celery seed, and 
serve hot with sippets.

SALMON SOUP 

Mix a tablespoon of butter and two tablespoons of flour 

and put in a saucepan to melt, adding also a teaspoon of salt, 

a dash of cayenne pepper and half a teaspoon of celery salt 

Add this thickening to one quart of milk heated in a double- 



A DoublE-Boiler 

boiler. While all is slowly cooking together open a small can 
of salmon, mince the fish fine, free it from all bone and skin, 
and stir into the hot, thickened milk. Boil up and serve at 
once. 

SHRIMP GUMBO 

A LOUISIANA DISH 

Hull the raw shrimps. To one tablespoon of boiling 
beef dripping add two tablespoons of sifted flour. When 
browned, add one large minced onion and brown thor- 
oughly. Add one pint of raw shrimps. Brown, stirring 
constantly, taking care not to mash the shrimps. When 
half cooked, add two tablespoons of canned tomatoes, one 
clove of minced garlic, one bay leaf, a pinch of thyme, and 
summer savory, salt to taste, and a dash of cayenne pepper. 
Add one quart of beef tea, or water in which a chicken has 
been boiled. Water will do if you have not these. Boil until 



BOUILLONS, SOUPS, GUMBOS 89 

the shrimps are tenden Add a teaspoon of fil^ powder before 
removing from the fire. Serve with plain boiled rice, 

SOUP STOCK 

Put a fifteen-cent neck bone and a ten-cent rose bone in 
a granite soup kettle. Pour over them six quarts of cold 
water. Stand the kettle on the back of the stove one hour. 
Then place it over a good fire. In about thirty minutes the 
scum will begin to rise and the water to steam. Now place 
over a moderate fire. Add one teacup of cold water and 
skim off all the scum. Cover the kettle closely, and set a weight 
on the cover. Let it simmer (not boil) four hours. Cut an 
onion in halves and stick twelve cloves in it. Slice another 
onion. Fry both a light brown in a little butter and add to the 
soup. Add one stalk of celery cut in pieces, three sprigs 
of parsley, two carrots cut in pieces, and one bay leaf. 
After adding these vegetables, let simmer one hour longer. 
Now strain the stock through a fine wire sieve. Add two 
tablespoons of salt, and stand in a icold place to cool. If kept 
in a warm place it will not make a nice jelly. When cold take 
off all the grease from the top. It is ready for use. Put it 
in a covered stone jar, and keep it in a cold place till used. 

FAST DAY TOMATO SOUP 

Slice three onions and fry them brown in their own juice 
in the bottom of the saucepan in which you make your soup. 
When the onions have fried pour over them a quart can of 
tomatoes well mashed, and a quart of boiling water. Cook 
all well together till the tomatoes are tender, then rub through 
a colander and put back in the saucepan. Add a cup of boiled 
rice, salt, and make of the thickness you wish with flour and 
butter worked smooth together, and in the proportion of one 
tablespoon of butter to one of flour. Simmer while the flour 
cooks, add a dash of pepper and serve hot with sippets fried 
in butter.

TURKEY SOUP. 

To use the remains of a turkey break up the carcass of the 
bird, keeping all the bones and skin, put in a pot and cover 
with cold water. Set on the back of the stove and let simmer 
for hours. Cover tight, but if the water boils low renew it. 
At night strain through a colander to get out the bones, and 
set to cool. Next day take off the hard fat on the top, put the 
jellied soup in a pot, stir in a cup of fresh milk when the soup 
is hot, and serve with a spoon of boiled rice. 

MEATLESS VEGETABLE SOUP 

Boil two tomatoes, two potatoes, one onion and one table- 
spoon of rice in one quart of water one hour. Season with 
salt, put through a sieve and serve hot with small rounds of 
toast. 

WHITE SOUP STOCK 

Take a shinbone of veal, weighing four pounds, and one 
small chicken. Add six quarts of cold water, one head of 
celery and two onions cut fine. Boil slowly four hours. Then 
add salt and pepper to taste, a piece of cinnamon and a piece 
of mace. After boiling strain off and allow to cool. This 
should make a solid jelly, and from it any kind of white 
soup or sauce can be made.

BAKED OYSTERS 

STIR over a moderate fire half a cup of butter and a cup of 
cream. Add a dash of cayemie> the grated yellow of 
a lemon-peel, and a few drops of Tabasco or old-fashioned 
pepper sauce. When the mixture simmers to the bub- 
bling point pour a third of it in the bottom of a baking 
dish, lay oysters in thickly, and sprinkle them with bread- 
crumbs and salt Next pour in another third of the cream^ 
and put in another thick layer of oysters with bread- 
crumbs and a little salt on top, and finally pour over your last 
third of the cream. Bake in a quick oven till thoroughly hot 
through and through. The cream on top will brown. 

CREAMED OYSTERS 

Heat two dozen oysters in their own liquor, seasoning 
with salt, cayenne, and also with white pepper, if liked. When 
the oysters fill out, strain. To this liquor add a cup of creani, 
and boil up and skim. Then stir in two tablespoons bf 
butter creamed with two tablespoons of flour. As the cream 
thickens add a teaspoon of lemon- juice and the same quantity 
of celery salt. Lastly, put in the oysters which you have 
chopped. Let all boil up two minutes and serve. 

CURRIED OYSTERS 

Gx>k in their own juice a quart of oysters till their edges 
b^n to curl. Then put in a tablespoon of butter blended with 



42 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

a tablespoon of flour, a teaspoon of curry powder, salt to taste, 
and a dash of cayenne. Stir all together and serve at once 
when the flour has cooked and thickened. 

DEVILED OYSTERS 

Drain off their juice and chop coarse a pint of oysters. 
Take a heaping tablespoon of butter, a heaping tablespoon of 
flour, the yolk of an egg, mix and add salt and cayenne pepper 
to taste, and three-fourths of a cup of milk. Stir in the pint 
of oysters and a tablespoon of lemon- juice. Drop upon little 
individual dishes or shells, sprinkle with cracker or bread- 





Small Dish and SheU 

crumbs which have been seasoned with melted butter, and 
bake fifteen minutes in a hot oven. For ease and expedition 
set your small dishes or shells in a large pan when ready to go 
to the oven. 

OYSTER FRICASSEE 

Put a quart of oysters in their own liquor over the fire and 
let come to boil. Tip in a strainer and drain off the juice. 
Put butter the size of an egg in a saucepan, add two table- 
spoons of flour, mix well, and then add the oyster-juice and a 
cup of jcream ; also salt and cayenne to taste. Beat the yolks 
of two eggs and add a full teaspoon of lemon- juice. Stir this 
into the cream, set again on the fire, add the oysters, heat, but 
do not boil, and serve hot. 

FRIED OYSTERS 

Select large fine oysters. Pour into a colander and drain 
off the liquor. Take them out and lay each one separately on 
a towel. Lay another towel over, and press gently to dry the 



OYSTERS AND CLAMS 48 

oysters. Roll a quantity of soda crackers very fine and season 
carefully with salt and red pepper. Beat two or three eggs 
as needed, allowing to each egg one tablespoon of cold water. 
Dip each oyster separately, first into the egg, and then turn 
it over and over in the rolled cracker. Prepare all the oysters 
at one time in this way, and lay them on platters or plates. 
Have all ready before you begin to fry them. Put into a 
frying-pan (use two pans if you have many oysters to fry) 
half lard and half butter, only just enough to prevent the 
oysters from sticking. Have the fat hot. Put in only as many 
oysters as you can easily turn, and use both a knife and fork 
in turning them. When the oysters are a nice brown they 
are done. Take them out, and if you fry more oysters 
wash the frying-pan clean, and again put in fresh lard and 
butter. 

Oysters can be fried half an hour or hours before they 
are needed. Take the oysters from the frying-pan, lay them 
side by side (never one on top of another) in pans or on pie 
plates. Set them aside, resting one pan on the rim of another. 
Half an hour before serving set them in the oven and heat 
very hot. Serve on a hot dish. 

OYSTER JAMBOLAYA 

Proceed as for "J^^^^l^iy^^/' page 120, adding oysters in 
place of sausage or diicken. Use a little of the oyster- juice, 
but very little. The oysters must be drained very dry before 
adding. 

OYSTERS OR CLAMS A LA NEWBURG 

Oysters or clams may be prepared k la Newburg, fol- 
lowing the directions for lobster on page 50 and substituting 
. either one you choose for the lobster. When you use clams 
take off the hard parts, chop fine, mix with the soft parts and 
use both together as you use lobster meat. 

Turkey, chicken, and game, not forgetting sweetbread, 
may be treated as lobster and dressed a la Newburg.

OYSTER PIE 

Select good oysters. Put them in a colander to drain* 
Make a pie crust the same as for a fruit pie. Line a pie plate 
with a crust the same as for an ordinary sweet fruit pie. 
Season the oysters with salt and pepper before putting them 
on the pie plate. Mix through them, after they are on the 
pie plate (ac^rding to the size of the pie), eight or ten strips 
or more of the pastry, one inch long and a quarter of an inch 
wide, rolled thin. Cut in bits two teaspoons of butter and 
lay over the oysters. Cover with enough of the oyster liquor 
to moisten the oysters. Sprinkle flour over the top ; this, with 
the pastry pieces, will thicken the liquor. Roll a thick upper 
crust Lay it double on the pie; turn the upper half over, 
and dip the knife in flour before trimming the edge of the 
pie. Cut open the centre with four strokes. Bake the pie 
until a light brown, and serve hot [See illustration, Plate L] 

CLAM PIE 

Drain, and then cut in three pieces each clam of a qtiart 
of hardshell clams. Have at hand three good-sized boiled 
potatoes and two hard-boiled eggs. In a deep baking dish 
lay a plain pastry lining, and on the bottom put a layer of 
clams. Over the clams sprinkle powdered crackers and then 
put in a layer of slices of boiled potato and hard-boiled egg, 
salting and lightly dusting with pepper each layer. Alternate 
the layers till you have used your material. Lay on small 
pieces of butter. Add half a cup of clam- juice or water, put 
a pastry cover over the pie, cut holes in the centre for the 
escape of steam, and bake forty minutes to an hour in hot 
oven. 

PIGS IN BLANKETS 

Drain some large plump oysters, and salt and pepper them. 
Round each oyster wrap a thin slice of fat bacon, pinning 
the bacon with a wooden toothpick. Lay in a hot frying-pan 
and cook until the bacon is a crisp light brown. Lay upon 
small pieces of toasted white or graham bread and serve hot 



OYSTERS AND CLAMS 45 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

In a baking dish put a layer of oysters, either medium- 
sized or large. Over them drop a few small pieces of butter, 
and also sprinkle pepper and salt. Lay on fine breadcrumbs, 
and on them pour a little of the oyster liquor. Next put in 
oysters as above directed and then breadcrumbs as above 
directed. So fill the dish, covering the upper layer of the bread 
with pieces of butter. Bake twenty minutes in a hot oven, 
and serve hot 

TOASTED OYSTERS 

Drain the oysters you wish to toast Heat their liquor 
in a saucepan. In another hot saucepan drop the oysters and 
move them about till they curl and plump. Have hot buttered 
toast on a hot plate or platter. Lay the oysters on the toast, 
and over each slice pour the hot oyster liquor, which you have 
seasoned to taste with salt, pepper, and butter. Serve at once. 

OYSTERS ON TOAST OR CANAPES 

Chop two dozen large oysters and mix with a heaping 
tablespoon of fine breadcrumbs. Melt a heaping tablespoon 
of butter in a saucepan, add a cup of cream, half a teaspoon 
of salt and a dash of cayenne, and when all is hot tip in the 
oysters and breadcrumbs. Have ready four or five slices of 
bread cut in circles, fingers, or triangles, and fried a golden 
brown. The bread must not be too thin, say quarter of an 
inch thick. Put the bread in a hot dish and pour over it the 
oyster mixture. 

CLAM TOAST 

Cut off the soft part of two dozen clams and simmer in 
only enough water to cover. When they have cooked thus 
twenty or thirty minutes, add a cup of milk into which you 
have stirred smooth a tablespoon of flour. Let this boil up 
and the flour thicken, and then stir in a beaten egg. Take 



46 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

from the fire, add a dash of cayenne, and pour over toast 
which you have just toasted hot and buttered. 

OYSTERS IN WHITE BLANKETS 

Use soft, finely-mashed potato and make thin cakes. Cover 
a cake with an oyster, or if one oyster is not large enough 
use more than one. Put over the oyster another cake of the 
same size, pinch together the edges of the cakes, lay in a hot 
pan well oiled with oil, butter, or sweet drippings, and bake 
till the potato is a light brown.

Creamed Shrimps 

IT has been said that the first person who ate a lobster must 
have been either starving or exceedingly brave; for there 
is but one other shellfish as forbidding in appearance as the 
lobster, and that is the crab. 

Within this uninviting exterior is a delicious white-and- 
pink flesh, the like of which can hardly be equaled. When 
broiled and served with hot butter sauce, seasoned with lemon- 
juice, and garnished with crisp greens, it is delicious. 

The lobster season extends from March to November. 
One can, of course, procure lobsters during all seasons, but, 
like oysters, they have their time, and out of season they are 
stringy and lack delicate flavor. 

SIGNS OF A GOOD LOBSTER 

Always reject a dead lobster; that is, do not buy an un- 
boiled lobster which is lifeless, as they are unwholesome. 
When buying ready-boiled lobsters their freshness can be de- 
termined by the tail, which should be curled tightly under 
and when drawn out spring quickly back into place. Unless 
it does this the lobster was boiled when dead and should be 
rejected. When buying a live lobster see that it is lively when 
touched. 

BOILING 

For boiling a lobster have a deep kettle with enough water 
to entirely cover the lobster. When the water becomes hot 



48 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

take the lobster by the back and put it in head first; cover 
tight. When the water boils put in one tablespoon of salt 
and boil steadily for thirty minutes. 

PREPARING 

When cooked and cooled, twist off the daws and legs; 
break the tail apart from the body; remove the green sub- 
stance, which is the fat, and considered the tid-bit by epi- 
cures, and also the coral, the fine pink eggs. The stcxnach 
lies directly under the head and should be removed and 
thrown away; also the woolly gills. 

Now pick out all the small pieces of meat which lie under 
the gills. Crack the claws and remove the meat. Cut the 
legs open with a pair of scissors and remove the meat. With 
a pointed, sharp knife or scissors cut open the tail, inside; re- 
move the meat in one piece; then open it and take out the 
one intestine which runs the entire length of the creature. 

The meat is now ready to be served in any way preferred. 

LOBSTER BAKED IN THE SHELL 

Cut the meat into small pieces. Have ready three hard- 
boiled eggs. In a saucepan place two tablespoons of butter. 
When melted, stir in two heaping tablespoons of flour and 
continue stirring until well mixed. Now add one pint of hot 
milk and stir until thick and smooth. Remove from the fire, 
and add one teaspoon of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoon of 
paprika, one teaspoon of lemon-juice, the lobster meat, the 
eggs chopped very fine. Fill the shell. Cover with fine 
cracker-crumbs mixed with a little butter. Set in a hot oven 
to brown. Serve with half-slices of lemon. [See illustration, 
Plate IL] 

LOBSTER SALAD IN TOMATO RING 

Cut the lobster in small cubes and to each cup add half 
a cup of crisp, tender celery cut in thin slices. Mix with a 
^ mayonnaise in which fold one cup of whipped cream. 



LOBSTERS, CRABS, SHRIMPS 49 

Boil the contents of a two-pound can of tomatoes with one 
bay leaf, twelve peppercorns, six sprigs of parsley, one onion, 
one teaspoon of celery salt, half a teaspoon of paprika for 
twenty minutes; then strain. Add to the liquid two table- 
spoons of gelatine, stir until dissolved, then turn into a ring 
moild. Set on ice to chill; then dip into warm water for an 
instant, invert on a plate, and the firm jelly will slip out un- 
broken. Now heap the salad in the centre, and garnish with 
the legs and under part of large claws, surrounding with 
parsley or cress. [See illustration, Plate IL] 

LOBSTER CROQUETTES 

Prepare the white sauce as given in the directions above, 
seasoning with the pepper, salt, and lemon- juice, omitting the 
hard-boiled eggs, but adding one raw egg with the lobster 
meat. Spread on a shallow, buttered pan to cool. Then form 
into balls, a tablespoon of the mixture in each, by rolling 
between the palms. Coat with fine breadcrumbs, then dip 
into raw egg yolk seasoned with salt and pepper. Roll into 
very fine breadcrumbs again and drop into a kettle of deep, 
smoking-hot fat. When a delicate brown, remove and drain 
on unglazed paper. Place on a folded napkin, and garnish 
with watercress and the legs. [See illustration, Plate III.] 

LOBSTER MELON 

Cook half a cup of milk and half a cup of breadcrumbs 
together. Add one and a half cups of lobster meat, chopped 
very fine; one teaspoon of salt, one- fourth of a teaspoon of 
paprika, one tablespoon of sherry, the stiffly' beaten whites 
of three eggs. Line a melon mold, well buttered, with this 
mixture. Cut the tails of two lobsters into small cubes; fill 
the cavity in the mold and pour into this one cup of the white 
sauce, to which add the yolks of two eggs and one whole egg 
well beaten. Stand the mold in warm water and bake until 
firm. Unmold, garnish with watercress or parsley, and place 
the lobster head in centre of top. [See illustration, Plate III.}»

LOBSTER CUTLETS 

For this dish canned lobster may be used. Open the can, 
at once tip out the contents, pouring away the liquor. Chop 
the meat in small pieces. To the meat add an equal measure 
of breadcrumbs. Season with salt, lemon- juice, and cayenne, 
and moisten with milk until pasty enough to mold into 
cutlet form. Then dip the cutlets into a mixture of egg and 
breadcrumbs, and fry till a light brown in deep hot fat. Lay 
to drain for a moment upon brown paper and serve hot. 

DEVILED LOBSTER 

The foregoing receipt may be used for deviled lobster with 
the following variation in the cooking. When you have made 
the lobster ready for cooking, instead of forming it into cutlets 
lay it in individual dishes, put breadcrumbs upon it, pour 
melted butter over it, and bake in a quick oven until the bread- 
cnunbs are a crisp brown. 

LOBSTER A LA NEWBURG 

Melt a tablespoon of butter in a saucepan or chafing-dish, 
and then stir in half a tablespoon of flour. After these are 
blended add gradually a cup of cream and see that it is well 
mixed in. When the cream is steaming and smooth stir in 
two pounds of lobster meat cut in small pieces, and when this 
is thoroughly heated through add a teaspoon of salt, quarter 
of a teaspoon of cayenne, and two tablespoons of sherry. 
Stir once more thoroughly, add the beaten yolks of two eggs, 
put in hot dish and serve immediately. 

BROILED SOFT-SHELL CRABS ON TOAST 

Choose crabs of good size, wash and clean them carefully. 
Then brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
lay over a hot fire on a broiler. Broil five minutes on one 
side, then turn and broil the other side five minutes. Have 
ready small pieces of white bread nicely browned and hot. 



LOBSTERS, CRABS, SHRIMPS 51 

Lay a crab on each piece of bread, and drop upon it a tea- 
spoon of maitre d'hotel sauce and a silce of lemon. Serve 
hot and at once. 

CREAMED SHRIMPS 

Mince a small onion and brown it in a saucepan with two 
tablespoons of butter. Stir in three tablespoons of cold 
boiled rice, three taUespoons of cream, and a cup of fresh or 
canned shrimps. Cook a minute, add a dash of tomato catsup 
and a tablespoon of tomato sauce, stir in and serve hot

BUYING FISH 

THERE is no better lesson on how to choose fish than 
this : if it is possible in your own neighborhood, or while 
vacationing in summer, go to see a fishing boat empty its 
gleaming cargo on the wharf and make an individual study 
of that cargo. Learn to know the earmarks — ^not only those 
called St. Peter's on a haddock, but the signs of perfect fresh- 
ness on all fish. Do not be afraid of touching them; fresh 
smelts have the fragrance of violets, and every fish has a 
wholesome' smell. Turn them over, examine them closely. 
''An eye like a dead fish" refers to a fish which has lain for 
weeks in cold storage, not to one just from the water. It 
will have eyes as full and almost as clear as any living crea- 
ture. Notice the gills; they will be beautifully red, the fins 
will be stiff, the scales shining, and the flesh so firm that it 
springs right back after the finger has been pressed into it. 
One can not expect, especially if one's home is some distance 
from the ocean or the great lakes, to find in market fish as 
superlatively fresh as when lifted straight from the net. Still, 
to be fit for human food they should not have lost much of 
their beauty. The signs to avoid are limp fins, dull eyes, pale, 
liver-colored gills, flesh in which you leave a dent by an im- 
pression of the finger, streaks of gray or yellow in the skin and 



FRESH FISH 58 

flesh, and the slightest symptom of a disagreeable odor. If 
you have to make the choice between salt pork and a fish of 
this description, choose salt pork; it is infinitely more health- 
ful ; it does not contain a possibility of poisoning. When pur- 
chasing halibut or swordfish, where the head and fins have 
been removed, the test is pearly white or shining gray skin, 
firm flesh, and a good odor. It is an excellent rule never to 
buy fish which is out of season. If you want bluefish in Feb- 
ruary or shad in November, you can probably obtain it — a fish 
dealer will produce almost anything from his refrigerator at 
any time of the year — ^but you may rest assured it has known 
a repose of months in cold storage. If not really dangerous 
to eat, it will be flabby, it will go to pieces before it is cooked 
and be lacking in flavor. It is an excellent plan to post one's 
self thoroughly on the fish whkh is in season all the year round, 
and purchase that according to the month. A dealer will as- 
sure you that fish which has been packed in ice ten days is in 
as excellent condition as when fresh caught. I should say 
seven or eight days is the limit. After that time it will begin 
to lose its beautiful moliier-of-pearl sheen. 

Although the old theory that fish is brain food has been 
exfdoded, the brain-worker will find what he most requires in 
a bountiful diet of fish. It is digestible food which is not over- 
stimulating or over-nutritive. Both the poet and the preacher 
will do better work on a dinner of broiled bluefish than on rare 
roast beef. Salmon, mackerel, and eels, which are exceed- 
ingly oily, are an exception to the digestible rule. They should 
be severely let alone by people of weak stomachs, while white- 
fish may be classed as the most digestible of all fish. 

The shimmering array on a market stall is alluring and 
confusing, and the fish dealer is apt to be persuasive. It is no 
economy to be inveigled into buying a five-pound bluefish 
when two pounds of halibut would have fed your family. Fish 
left over can be utilized nicely in ntiany ways, as the following 
pages will show, but it is better not to have any ; in summer, 
cold fish has not remarkable keeping qualities. Decide when 
yoa order a fish how you will cook it. The fish dealer can 



54 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

prepare it for planking or broiling better than you can. The 
cheapest fish is not always the most economical. Five pounds 
of cod will contain about two potmds of waste in the shape 
of skin, head, tail, and bone, while two pounds of halibut is 
solid fish with scarcely an ounce of waste. 

COOKING 

The cooking of fish depends very largely on taste, for va- 
rious methods apply frequently and most appetizingly to the 
same fish. Take halibut, for instance. It may be baked, 
broiled, fried or boiled, and be quite as delicious in one way 
as another. This rule is also true of cod, haddock, and nearly 
every kind of white-fleshed fish. What a cook or a fish dealer 
calls dark fish — ^this class contains bluefish, mackerel, herring, 
salmon, eels, and shad — are best suited for broiling, baking, 
or planking. They contain so much oil distributed through 
the flesh that it requires a dry, intense heat to make them 
palatable. Salmon is an exception to this rule, being at its best 
when boiled. An old saying declares, ''Small fish should 
swim twice — once in water, once in oil." It is a good proverb 
for the cook to remember, because it applies well to every 
tiny fish. Smelts, brook trout, perch, whitebait, catfish, sun- 
fish, bullheads, and everything in small finny things, partly 
for the preservation of the small amount of meat on their 
bones, should be carefully stripped, cleaned, egged, crumbed, 
and fried. Sometimes these small fish are sauted, but they are 
not so good nor so wholesome as when they "swim in oil." 

BAKING 

When baking halibut pour milk over and around it before 
setting it in the oven. It keeps the fish moist, improves the 
flavor, and makes it brown more thoroughly. 

BOILING 

In boiling, if you have no fish kettle, improvise one. Line 
a wire basket with a cloth, allowing the linen to fall over the 



FRESH FISH 65 

edges ; put in the fish, coiling it slightly if it is large, and drop 
the basket in the boiling water. This is an easier method for 
lifting it out whole than if set right in the kettle. 

In spite of careful watching, a fish will occasionally break 
in the boiling. Do not try to patch it together into an un- 
sightly heap of skin, bones, and meat. Flake it quickly and 
lay in good-sized portions on a large platter. Garnish with 
mashed potato, and over the fish pour a sauce. This trans- 
forms an almost hopeless failure into a most attractive dish. 

BROILING 

An oily fish, such as mackerel or bluefish, needs no enrich- 
ment of fat before broiling; a white-fleshed fish does. If it 
is cut in steaks, saturate it with oil or melted butter and a 
good seasoning of pepper and salt, then put between the wires 
of the broiler. Lay the thickest end in the centre of the 
broiler over the hottest part of the fire, skin side up. Let it 
get perfectly crisp and brown on the flesh side before turning. 
Broil the skin side very carefully ; it is apt to bum. Set it in 
a hot oven for five minutes to thoroughly finish the cooking. 

An iron fish sheet, with rings at each end for handles, may 
be made by any tinsmith for twenty-five cents. Grease it 
well before setting the fish to cook and lay under it strips of 
salt pork; then set it in a baking-pan. You will find it very 
easy to slip a baked fish from this sheet on to a platter. 

PLANKING 

The fish which plank to perfection are shad, whitefish, 
mackerel, bluefish, red snapper, and pompano. There are a 
number of real advantages to this method of cooking; it is 
so easy, it may be done in any hot oven of a coal or gas stove ; 
the wood imparts a flavor to the fish which can be obtained 
in no other way. Then there is no diflicult task of sliding it 
from a broiler or bake-pan to the platter, because it is the 
proper thing to send the plank straight to the table laid on 
a folded towel. If you have to prepare a fish yourself for 



66 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

planking, remember it must be cut down the back instead of 
down the stomach, the thin portion of the flesh going on the 
middle of the plank. 

ACCOMPANYING DISHES 

Fish of all sorts require the accompaniment of a starch 
food to make a well-balanced meal; it may be bread, rice, 
potatoes or macaroni. 

TO BAKE FISH 

Free the fish from scales, and draw it from the gills. 
Wash it in a quick bath in cold water and lay it in an en- 
ameled baking-pan. For its stuffing see directions following. 




Bread Gnter. (Also used for Cora, Cheese, and Cocoanut.) 

Pour in enough boiling water to cover the bottom of the 
baking-pan, dust the fish with pepper, sprinkle with salt, lay 
on a tablespoon of butter, and bake in a quick oven. Baste 
often and keep hot water supplied to the baking-pan. For a 
large fish allow from one to two hours; for small fish, from 
thirty minutes to an hour. When done push carefully from 
the pan to a hot platter, garnish with slices of lemon, and 
serve with drawn butter, white sauce, or some of the sauces 
found on pages 141 to 147. 



FRESH FISH 67 

BREAD FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED FISH 

Moisten breadcrumbs enough to fill and plump out the 
fish, and season with salt, pepper, butter, and minced onion. 
Add fat salt port chopped fine in the proportion of a heaping 
tablespoon of the chopped pork to one cup of breadcrumbs. 
Mix all together well, fill the inside of the fish, sew or tie the 
fish together, and bake as under directions for baked fish. 

POTATO FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED FISH 

Peel and boil a quart of potatoes. When cooked chop 
coarsely. Add three good-sized onions finely minced and 
browned in a tablespoon of butter. Add, if you have it, two 
tablespoons of minced parsley. Season with half a teaspoon 
of salt and a little pepper. Stir in quarter of a cup of butter 
when you have all the ingredients well mixed, and put inside 
your fish. If you have any stuffing left over, lay it in a comer 
of the pan in which the fish is baked* 

VEAL STUFFING FOR BAKED FISH 

Mix a cup of finely chopped cooked veal and a cup of 
breadcrumbs, wet with water and squeeze dry. Add half 
as much finely chopped salt pork as you have veal. Mix 
all together, add the juice of half a lemon, salt and pepper to 
taste, and stir in a beaten egg. Stuff the fish, sew or tie il 
together, and bake according to directions for baked fish. 

BAKED FISH WITH OYSTER DRESSING 

A LOUISIANA RECEIPT 

Use a four-pound fish; any nice firm-meated fish, such as 
bluefish, redfish, whitefish, or red snapper, may be used. Fry 
one minced onion in a tablespoon of butter, add one teacup 
of cracker-crumbs, one teaspoon of salt, one minced garlic 
clove, one tablespoon of tomato-juice, a pinch of red pepper, 
and half a teaspoon of thyme. Brown and mix well. Add 
two dozen drained and chopped casters. Brown until quite 



68 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

dry. With this stuff the body and head of the fish, sewing 
the sides of the fish together to keep the dressing in. Dust 
with flour and lay in the baking-pan. Lay some slices of 
fresh tomatoes over the fish^ also four thin slices of bacon. 
Squeeze the juice of one lemon over, and also sprinkle over 
a little salt and cayenne pepper. Bake half an hour in a 
medium heat, basting with tomato-juice. Serve with crisp, 
white lettuce and mayonnaise or French dressing. 

TO BOIL FISH 

In getting a fish ready to cook, scale it, draw it, and souse 
it quickly in cold water. Have ready a kettle holding enough 
boiling water to cover the fish. Tie the fish in a square of 
cheesecloth to keep it from dropping apart, and slip into the 
boiling water. Allow twenty minutes of boiling for each 
pound when it is a cut from a large fish of the cod or halibut 
kind; when the fish is small, or long and whole, allow about 
ten minutes. When the fish is nearly done add salt. Take 
it from the pot, slip it from the cheesecloth on a hot 
platter, and serve with some one of the fish sauces found on 
pages 141 to 147. 

In washing the cheesecloth in which the fish was cooked, 
do not use soap. Wash first in cool water and then in hot till 
perfectly clean. Dry, fold, and lay aside for next using. 

SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH 

Make a drawn butter of two heaping tablespoons of butter 
and two heaping tablespoons of flour, blended together. Put 
this in a small saucepan. Pour over it hot water to dissolve, 
add more warm water until you have one pint. Salt to taste. 
Set this in another saucepan with a small quantity of hot 
water in it Stir constantly as the water underneath boils, and 
let it boil slowly. Raise it from the under saucepan now 
and then, and stir hard to prevent lumping. Return it to 
the water. Do this until the sauce is thick enough to pour 
easily. It must be perfectly smooth. Take it from the fire» 



r' 



FRESH FISH 60 

and add gradually the yolks of two beaten eggs, the juice of 
half a lemon, a teaspoon of onion- juice, and a tablespoon of 
chopped parsley. Serve hot. 

TO BROIL FISH 

Have your bluefish, trout, mackerel, shad, or whatever 
fish you have chosen well cleaned of scales, drawn and split 
down the back. Souse it for a second in clear cold water, 
have ready a hot broiler, rub the broiler with suet, and lay 
on the fish. Present first to the fire the flesh, or inside, of the 
fish, and when that is seared crisp so the juices will stay in, 
turn and sear the skin side. Now turn the fish from side to 
side frequently, and continue the broiling till done. Have 
ready a hot platter, salt the fish just before taking from the 
broiler, lay on the hot platter, spread on the fish a few pieces 
of butter, add thin slices of lemon and serve. 

PLANKED FISH 

Fish may be planked before a coal fire, but the broiling- 
oven of a gas stove is more excellent for this sort of cooking. 
First have your plank of hard, smooth wood. It must be of 
a size to go easily in your oven; the comers had best be 
rounded off smootfily. Make ready your succulent shad, or 
indeed whatever fish you choose, by scaling, drawing, split- 
ting down the back, and a quick, cold plunge, and upon the 
heated plank lay the fish. Its skin side must be against the 
board. Set under the broiler, and cook quickly for the first 
five minutes, more slowly afterward. As the broiling goes 
on, baste the fish with boiling hot water slightly salted. When 
it is done, which ought to be, unless it is very thick, in from 
twelve to seventeen minutes, draw the plank from the oven, 
set it on a hot platter or a napkin, spread with butter, garnish 
with thin slices or quarters of lemon and parsley, and serve 
— the fish on the board and all on the platter or napkin. 

A word should be added about the care of the plank on 
which the fish is cooked. Do not wash it with soap. Scour 



60 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

it clean, wash it with boiling water, dry it perfectly, treat it 
carefully and keep it long, for an old board, that is one upon 
which fish have been planked, is better than a new one for 
cooking. 

SCALLOPED FISH 

Pick in small pieces two pounds of cold boiled fish. 
Make a cream by heating a pint of milk and mixing in quarter 
of a cup of flour and a scant teacup of butter. When the 
milk thickens season with salt, pepper, thyme, and chopped 
parsley, and if your taste directs also with a minced onion. 
Take at once from the fire, and as the ssream cools stir in the 
beaten yolks of four eggs. Have a buttered baking dish, and 
put in a layer of the cream, then a layer of the fish, then of 
cream, and then of fish, so alternating till the top layer of 
cream is reached. Chi the top layer put grated cheese and 
breadcrumbs, and bake in a moderate oven about forty 
minutes. 

STEAMED FISH 

Have about a two-and-a-half-pound fish, cod or halibut, 
mashed very fine and raw. Season to your taste with salt, 
pepper, and onion-juice. Add three eggs beaten together, 
three tablespoons of flour, and milk enough to moisten. Put 
the fish in a mold and steam two hours. For a sauce to 
eat with this fish, follow the directions for a cream sauce. 
Season the sauce highly with cayenne, and add boiled lobster 
cut in small bits. 

CREAMED COD OR HALIBUT 

Take boiled cod or halibut left from another meal 
and kept cold. Pick it to pieces, and take out all the bones 
and sldn. To the proportion of about half a pound of the 
fish take a tablespoon of butter and the same quantity of 
flour. In a saucepan over a moderate fire stir the butter 
and flour together, add half a cup of milk and a pinch of salt, 
and when the whole boils up a dash of pepper. Stir in the 



FRESH FISH 61 

fish, heat slowly, and put in a hot dish, setting halves of 
hard-boiled eggs round the edge. 

CREAMED FROGS' LEGS 

Use the hind legs. Separate the legs at the joint. Drop 
in boiling salted water, and cook three minutes. Remove and 
simmer in enough milk to cover till the meat is thoroughly 
cooked and tender. Salt and pepper the milk to taste, and 
thicken with flour, adding enough butter or thick cream to 
give richness to the dish, in the proportion of a tablespoon 
of butter to four sets of legs. 

FRIED FROGS' LEGS 

Use only the hind legs. Drop them in salted boiling 
water, and let them boil three or four minutes. Drain and 
wipe dry. Have a plate of rolled cracker and a plate of eggs 
beaten a little. Dip the frogs' legs in the egg, then in the 
rolled cracker. Drop in boiling oil, lard, or butter, and fry a 
delicate brown. Serve hot. 

FRIED FILETS OF HALIBUT 

Choose for halibut to be fried a slice about one and a half 
inches thick. Cut into your filets, removing carefully the 
skin and bone. Wipe each piece with a bit of damp cheese- 
cloth and then dry. Sprinkle with pepper and salt and roll 
in flour. Dip in egg, then in crumbs, fry in deep fat and 
drain on brown paper. 

COURT BOUILLON 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Have one tablespoon of boiling drippings in a deep casse- 
rcde. In this brown one tablespoon of flour. Add one minced 
onion, two large boiled potatoes quartered, one teacup of 
canned tomatoes, a pinch of thyme, a teaspoon of minced 
parsley, a tablespoon of chopped celery, one clove of minced 



62 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

garlic, half a teaspoon of salt, and one minced red pepper- 
pod. Allow these to simmer, and add one pound of white 
halibut, sliced in steaks. Simmer half an hour. Add one 
teacup of hot water to thin the ^^vy a bit. When ready to 



serve, add one glass of claret Serve, putting the fish on 
thin toast and pouring the gravy round. 

Halibut is mentioned, but any white-meated fish cut in 
slices may be used. 

KEGAREE 

Pick up cold fish, or one Lake Erie whitefish. Add the 
same quantity of )coId boiled rice, two to four soft-boiled 
eggs, salt to taste, a dash of cayenne pepper and a dash of 
mustard. Mix well together, fry in butter, like an omelet, till 
a delicate brown, and serve on a hot platter. 

BAKED MACKEREL 

Have the fish cleaned and split, and head and tail cut 
oS. Lay it flat in a dripping-pan which has been rubbed 
with drippings. Pour over the fish a cup of fresh milk, and 
then sprinkle it with salt, pepper, and a few small bits of 
butter. Bake in a hot oven about half an hour — judge ex- 
actly by its brown, flattened, "dull" appearance. Lay the 
fish on a hot platter and pour over it the hot milk in which 
it was cooked. 



FRESH FISH 63 

MACKEREL WITH VINEGAR 

A JEWISH DISH 

Cut off the heads and tails of the mackerel, clean and 
wash them. Lay in an earthen baking dish, adding whole 
pepper, cloves, allspice, and bay leaves to your taste in season- 
ing, and pouring over the fish equal quantities of water and 
vinegar almost to cover. Bake in a moderate oven till thor- 
oughly done, which will be in about an hour. 

FAST-DAY PIE 

Take what you have left of cold sole or haddock or cod- 
fish, take out all the bones, chop or cut in fine pieces, and 
pound the fish, with bits of butter strewed over it plentifully. 
Add and poxmd in a teaspoon of French mustard, a trifie of 
garlic, a raw onion, and a dash of vinegar. Put in an enamel 
pie or pudding dish, cover with mashed potato, and cook in 
a quick oven till the potato is browned over the top. 

CREAM FAST-DAY PIE 

For this pie you may boil the fish with salt or take what 
you have left of codfish, haddock, bass or any fish not too 
oily. Take out skin and bones, chop or cut the fish in small 
pieices. Then set over to boil a pint of cream or very rich 
milk, and when this is hot stir in two small tablespoons of 
flour dissolved in milk, a grated onion, and a teaspoon of salt. 
Butter a deep enamel dish, and put in a layer of the diced 
fish, then one of the cream sauce. Alternate the layers of fish 
and cream sauce till you have used up your material, bring- 
ing the cream layer the topmost. Lay on a few grated bread- 
cnmibs, dust pepper over the dish, and bake in a moderate 
oven for three-quarters of an hour. This pie may be made 
richer by adding bits of butter to the fish as the layers are 
put in the dish. 

BOILED RED SNAPPER 

Gean and scale a fresh red snapper that weighs five or 
six pounds. Wash it in cold water. Wrap it in a cloth and 



84 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

lay it in a fish boiler. Cover it with cold water, to which 
add one tablespoon of salt. When it comes to boil, set on a 
part of the stove where it will just bubble, and no more. 
Upon no account let the water boil. Simmer it in this way 
forty-five minutes. When done, take it carefully out of the 
cloth, and lay it on a hot platter, and serve. To be eaten 
with sauce directed for boiled fish. 

FRIED ROE 

Wash the roe dry with a cloth, roll in corn meal, salt 
and pepper, and fry in hot fat till a light brown. Serve with 
slices of lemon. 

SALMON CROQUETTES 

Take a one-pound can of salmon, pick out all the bones, 
and strain the juice, and save it. Chop the salmon fine, and 
add one teacup of stale breadcrumbs, one beaten egg, and 
salt and red pepper to taste. Wet the salmon with the liquor, 
mix well, and have it just moist enough to make into oblong 
croquettes. Beat one egg, with one tablespoon of cold water. 
Roll crackers fine, and season with salt and red pepper. Dip 
the croquettes first in the egg and then in the crackers. Fry 
in a frying-pan, with just enough hot lard to keep them from 
sticking. If not needed at once, the croquettes can be warmed 
over by putting them in a covered pan in the oven. 

SALMON WITH WHITE SAUCE 

Take cold boiled salmon, or, if you use the canned salmon, 
slip it from its can and heat in a saucepan with its own oil. 
Make a white sauce like that described on page 147, season 
the sauce with lemon-juice, with pepper sauce, or with 
Worcestershire as your taste directs. Lay the hot salmon oil 
a hot platter, cover it with the white sauce, lay round the 
edge of the dish slices of hard-boiled eggs and sliced lemon, 
and serve. 



FRESH FISH 66 

COLD SALMON WITH VINEGAR 

Take one-pound can of salmon, pick out all the bones, 
strain off the liquor, and do not use it. Chop the salmon 
very fine, season with salt and red pepper, and add the yolk 
of one hard-boiled egg rubbed fine. Mix all together and 
beat with enough drawn butter to allow it to mold. Mold 
to shape in teacups. Set in a cold place to stiflfen. When 
eating slice it across, beginning at the top, and eat with a 
little vinegar. This is very delicate. 

FRIED SMELTS 

Wash the smelts, split and clean them, and cut away fins 
and gills. Roll in a mixture of pepper, salt, and fine bread- 
crumbs, dip in oil and roll again in the breadcrumbs. Put 
the tail in the mouth and pin together with a wooden tooth- 
pick. Put a few at a time in the frying-basket, plunge into 




Frying-Basket 

hot fat, and fry till they are a :crisp brown. When all are 
fried, put together in the frying-basket, plunge once more 
into the hot fat, and serve on a hot platter with lemon quar- 
ters and a tartare sauce. If you serve with the wooden 
skewers they must be small and out of sight. If they are 
large, draw them out. 

FRIED BROOK TROUT 

Oean, wipe quickly with ]Cold water, and dry the trout. 
Split to the tail. Put salt, a dash of pepper, and a sprinkle of 
flour over them. In a frying-pan put salt pork cut in small 
pieces, or, if you have not pork, use equal quantities of butter 



60 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and lard. When your pork fries out, and the fat is hot, take out 
the pork and put in the fish. Fry quickly a delicate brown, 
turning two or three times. Put on a very hot platter, lay 
on the crisp pieces of the pork, and send to the table still 
sizzling. With these delicate fish never serve any sauce or 
relish, for the same reason one can not add a perfume to the 
rose.

SOAKING SALT FISH 

DO NOT soak salt mackerel for next day's breakfast in 
warm water, or too long. By bad soaking the fish is 
sometimes spoiled, made flabby and tasteless, and voted a fail- 
ure, when if properly treated it would be appetizing. Use cold 
water, or, if milk is plenty with you, cold milk, and keep while 
soaking in a cool place. [See illustration, Plate IV.] 

BAKED SALT COD 

'Mix a cup of salt codfish picked up fine with twice its 
quantity of mashed potatoes. Add a pint of milk or cream, 
and then stir in two well-beaten eggs and half a cup of but- 
ter. Taste and see if the dish will not be salt enough with- 
out adding salt. Stir in a dash of cayenne, and put in a baking 
dish and bake half an hour in a moderate oven. 

CODFISH BALLS 

Codfish balls may be made in simpler fashion by using one 
cup of soft-boiled potatoes, mashed while hot and fresh into 
half a cup of shredded codfish. Fish and potato should be 
well mashed together, seasoned with a tablespoon of butter 
and a beaten egg, dropped into a pan or kettle of boiling 
hot lard and fried till a delicate brown. When lifted from 



68 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the fat they should drain a moment on brown paper and go 
to the table hot. 

A longer process for the making of the balls — ^and some 
claim a better one — is to soak a piece of salt codfish for seven 
or eight hours in cold water, changing the water once or 
twice. Then shred the fish, let it cook gently till tender, and 
put it through a sieve before adding it to hot potatoes. 

CREAMED SALT COD 

In the preparation for freshening the fish, proceed as di- 
rected in the receipt just before, or use the shredded cod bought 
at grocers'. For a cup of codfish take a pint of fresh milk, and 
heat in a saucepan over a moderate fire. When the milk be- 
comes hot stir in two tablespoons of fiour wetted with half 
a cup of cold milk. Stir constantly, that the milk may not 
scorch/ and cook till the flour thickens. Stir in two beaten 
eggs as you take the creamed fish from the fire. Pour on 
a hot platter, drop over it tiny lumps of butter, add a dash of 
pepper, and serve. 

DRAWN BUTTER SALT COD 

Cut three-quarters of a pound of nice white codfish. Lay 
it overnight in cold water enough to cover it. If required 
for a late dinner, put it to soak in the morning. Pour 
off half the water and add more fresh water to cover it 
Boil until tender, which will be about fifteen minutes. After 
boiling five minutes taste. If too salt, pour off all the water, 
add more, and finish boiling. Wh^i done, pick out all the 
bones, and chop fine. Boil and mash potatoes, have nothing 
with them but a little salt Add to the chopped fish as much 
potato as you have fish, and half as much more when mixed 
together, season with red pepper, and salt to taste, making 
it slightly hot with the pepper, and enough salt to give it a 
salt fish flavor, though not too salt. To this add one beaten 
egg, and enough drawn butter to wet it up, rather stiff. 



SALT FISH 69 

Serve very hot with drawn butter, made as follows: Take 
two heaping tablespoons of butter and two heaping table- 
spoons of flour, and mash together in a small saucepan. 
Set in another saucepan which has a little water in it. Pour 
over the mixed butter enough warm water to dissolve it Add 
more water to make three-quarters of a pint. Add salt to 
taste. Boil the water in the under saucepan slowly. Stir 
constantly to prevent lumping, and as it thickens now and 
then raise the upper saucepan from the water and stir hard 
that it may be perfectly smooth. When done, let it stand away 
from the fire, in the water, to keep hot — ^and cover to avoid 
a scum forming on top. Have two or three cold hard-boiled 
eggs. Slice and lay them on a separate small plate. When 
the fish is served to each person, put on the plate with it 
two slices of egg, and over the egg and fish pour drawn but- 
ter. Add also a sprinkle of red pepper, if wished. This is 
a very nice and delicate way of preparing salt codfish. 

PICKED SALT COD 

Put into a crock, and cover with cold water, three-quarters 
of a pound of salt codfish. Soak this overnight. If wanted 
for a late meal put it to soak in the morning. At the end of 
the time pour off half the water and add enough more cold 
water to cover it. Boil five minutes, and taste. If too salt, 
pour off more water, and add fresh warm water to cover it. 
Taste again. The flavor should be that of salt fish, but not 
too salt. Boil until tender, which will be about fifteen min- 
utes. When done, pour off the water, pick out the bones, 
and break the fish into pieces little less in size than the bowl 
of a teaspoon. Place the fish in a granite saucepan and cover 
it with cold milk. Season with salt if necessary, and red 
pepper to taste. Having been salted, the fish will require little. 
Add one beaten egg, and one tablespoon and a half of flour 
dissolved in cold water. Stir all together. Set the saucepan 
in another saucepan with hot water in it. As the water boils 
flie milk will gradually thicken. Stir constantly, and when it 
is creamy and moderately thick it is done. Add at this time 



70 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

tvfo teaspcK)ns of butter, and stir it through until melted. 
Move it from the hot part of the stove and leave it standing 
in the hot water to keep warm. Cover it until ready to serve. 

SALT CODFISH PIE 

Make a crust by sifting together four cups of flour, three 
heaping teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt 
Mix in half a cup of drippings or lard, and add milk till you 
have a soft dough — it will probably take about a pint of milk. 
Roll out, and for the upper crust roll in a little butter. Line 
a deep baking dish with the crust. Freshen some picked-up 
codfish by pouring tepid water over it and letting it stand 
five minutes, then draining. Put on the baking dish bottom 
crust a layer of the codfish, sprinkle with cracker or bread 
crumbs, lay next some bits of butter, and spread a cream 
sauce made by thickening a pint of boiling milk with two 
tablespoons of flour. Next break three or four uncooked 
eggs on the cream, salting and peppering the eggs. 'Make 
the next layer of the codfish, and proceed as directed in the 
layers till you have used your material and have a full dish. 
Lay on the top crust, slit its centre two or three times and 
bake the pie about three-quarters of an hour till the grust is 
a delicate brown. 

TOASTED SALT COD 

Tear the fish in thin strips and freshen by standing in 
tepid water five minutes. Press the strips on a cloth to dry 
them and then broil a light brown over a fire. Lay on a hot 
platter and spread each strip with butter. 

SALT COD WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Pick about half a pound of salt cod in small pieces and 
freshen it by letting it stand five minutes in enough tepid wa- 
ter to cover it. Or take the shredded codfish bought in pack- 
ages and ready for use — ^although you may find it a little too 
salt without freshening by rinsing in cold water. Grate or 



SALT FISH 71 

chop an onion fine, add it to half a cup of melted butter and 
two tablespoons of flour. Brown onion, butter and flour to- 
gether, add pepper to. your taste, and a cup of tomatoes cooked 
and beaten or put through a strainer till they form a smooth 
pulp. Cook together. Press the water from your cod, and 
when the sauce boils stir it in. Serve hot. 

BOILED FINNAN HADDIE 

In choosing the fish be sure its preservation is good. 
Not infrequently it may be found bad in some part Wash 
and skin and lay in cold water enough to cover. Set over 
a fire, cover tight, and keep just to simmering point. In 
half to three-quarters of an hour the flesh can be raised free 
from bone — which is a sign the fish is done. Have a hot 
platter, lay the fish on it, spread it with butter and serve at 
once. 

BROILED SMOKED HERRING 

Let the herring lie in hot water for a quarter of an hour. 
Wipe, rub off the skin, lay on a broiler over a hot fire and 
broily turning both sides to the fire. Lay on a hot platter 
and spread with butter or with mai'tre d'hdtel sauce, given 
on page 145. 

SALT MACKEREL WITH MILK SAUCE 

Wash the mackerel and soak overnight in cold water in 
a cold place. If you have plenty of milk cover the fish over- 
night with that for freshening. Next day rinse rapidly with 
cold water and put on its back in a dripping-pan. Pour over 
it fresh milk enough to rise to the upper surface as it lies in 
the pan, and bake half an hour in a good oven. About ten 
minutes before the fish is done mix together two even table- 
spoons of butter and two even tablespoons of flour. Stir this 
in the hot milk rotmd the fish, and leave it to finish cooking. 
Lay the fish on a hot platter, stir the thickened milk thoroughly, 
add a dash of cayenne and pour over the fish. 



72 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BROILED SALT MACKEREL 

Follow the directions for soaking given in the foregoing 
receipt. Wipe the fish dry, brush it lightly with olive oil, 
lay it on the broiler with skin side up first, then broil quickly. 
Lay on a hot platter, squeeze half a lemon over it, and send 
it to the table at once. A few sprigs of watercress or crisp 
red radishes go well with broiled mackerel

IN all parts of the country, whether in city, town, or village, 
every housewife who looks carefully to the matter of cur- 
rent expenses makes complaint that the rise in the price of 
meat adds a few dollars each month to her accoimts. The 
meats which have gone up most alarmingly in cost are the 
staple roasts, stews, and broils of every creature, and if one 
must have these regularly the bills will necessarily be larger. 
Yet there is a possibility of setting very tempting dishes each 
day before your family with a quite infrequent appearance 
of roast beef, lamb chops, or porterhouse steak. When nicely 
cooked, the meats which appear as a substitute will be so well 
relished that the expensive cuts will not be missed. Besides 
knowing how to cook, the woman who would economize along 
this line must know how to market. It is not the marketing 
which can be done over the telephone, or by orders given to 
a clerk. There are exemplary butchers and exemplary clerks, 
I have no doubt ; but it pays, even if it cost ten cents carfare, 
to visit the market yourself. A study of the counters will be 
sure to reveal something good and cheap which would not 
have been thought of in the kitchen or at the telephone. 

BEST TIME TO MARKET 

Except in hot weather, marketing trips need not be made 

every day. With a good refrigerator or well-chilled store 

closet at hand, meat may be purchased which will not only 

keep but prove better for being kept several days. In the 

depth of the winter market trips may be well arranged for

74 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Except in large cities 
the markets of Monday are not altogether attractive ; they sug- 
gest that the careful vender is trying to dispose to the best ad- 
vantage of Saturday's left-overs. It is an excellent thing to 
market at the earliest hours of the morning. At that time 
there is the largest choice of meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables ; 
besides, you are apt to receive more attention than later in 
the forenoon when the place grows thronged. 

THE MARKET BASKET 

If you have good common-sense you will carry a market 
basket. I am not of so doubting a humor as one housewife 
I know, who markets accompanied by a rubber stamp, brand- 
ing her name upon a convenient part of all fish, flesh, or fowl 
she purchases. I feel sure, however, with a market basket 
on my arm, I am receiving what I have selected. This plan 
has another advantage: in summer you will not receive meat 
or fish slightly tainted from long exposure to the sun in a de- 
livery wagon, or in winter frozen almost to the very point of 
being spoiled. In the coldest weather if I can not carry home 
such tender vegetables as lettuce, cress, parsley, or celery I 
do not buy them. I have been taught this lesson by the ap- 
pearance of too many wilted, frost-bitten vegetables. There is 
a third good reason for the housewife's market basket. With 
her purchases carried straight home, there is no waiting for 
an erratic delivery wagon. I am not the only housewife who 
can tell of afternoons spent in watching for the butcher's 
wagon and the roast or leg of lamb for which a hot oven 
anxiously yawned. The dinner which followed was frequently 
made memorable by a makeshift dish of frizzled beef or ham 
and eggs! 

MUTTON 

When it comes to the subject of reasonable priced meats 
which provide nourishing and appetizing dishes they are many 
and of large variety. A leg of mutton might be placed in 
the front rank as a wise purchase for a large family. Where 



ECONO^rr IN MARKETING AND COOKING 75 

there are ooly two or three at the family table the mutton 
would grow tedioiss by virtue of its many visits. If it can be 
used, however^ in a few meals it is excellent boiled very 
slowly and served with caper sauce. It also provides a pot 
of excellent stock, which, with barley and vegetables, makes 
a tureen of the best mutton broth. Usually a good leg of 
mutton — remember, it is of mutton I am speaking, not lamb — 
can be purchased for ten or twelve cents a pound. 

Another good way to cook a rather tough leg of mutton 
is by braizing it. Brush the meat over with butter, sear it 
quickly over a hot fire, then put with three cups of boiling 
water in a ck>sely covered soup pot. It should be well sea- 
soned with cloves and peppercorns, carrots, turnips, celery 
and onions cut in dice, also parsley and a bit of bay leaf. 
Fasten the lid on the soup pot with a thick paste of flour and 
water, and allow it to cook for five or six hours in an oven 
about at the temperature required for baked beans. Mutton 
prepared in this fashion is tender and delicious. 

SOUP MEAT 

There is a knack in knowing how to choose a good soup 
bone as well as in knowing how to cook it. It ought to be 
about two-thirds meat and one-third bone and fat. In the 
winter it is an excellent plan, provided you have a large 
enough soup kettle, to purchase two bones for soup— one the 
knuckle, which seldom costs over four or five cents a pound, 
Ae other a solid flesh piece, costing perhaps seven or eight 
cents. When the meat is cooked to the point where, if it were 
a stew, you would take it from the fire, lift out with a skim- 
mer on a large platter the meaty soup bone and cut away 
from it the nicest pieces of beef. You can often obtain two 
or three pounds of this meat, well seasoned and tendered by 
slow cooking. Return the bone to the soup kettle and allow 
it to simmer until the bones drop apart. The meat which 
has been taken out may be utilized in a number of ways. It 
makes excellent hash. When well seasoned it is not to be de- 
spised in the shape of croquettes. With a cup of the stock 



76 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and a few parboiled vegetables you have a savory stew, or 
in hot weather it may be inclosed in an aspic jelly. When 
used in this way soup bones costing forty cents may be made 
to yield two or three meals of good variety for a large family. 

OTHER CHEAP MEATS 

Sheep's or a beef heart, with a good bread stuffing, is a 
cheap and very appetizing dish; Sheep's liver, which in Eng- 
land is esteemed as highly as kidneys, is almost given away 
in American markets. Try it larded and baked, then covered 
with a rich brown gjavy, if you would know how good it can 
be made. Many cheap cuts of beef can be converted into ex- 
cellent meats by pot-roasting. Among them may be mentioned 
the lean, juicy cross-rib, or a solid piece from the lower part 
of round or face of the rump. Two pounds of flank, which 
costs from nine to ten cents a pound, make a very savory 
dish. The meat is rolled, sauted brown, highly seasoned, 
then braized slowly for two hours with just enough water 
to make a good gravy. The flank rolled makes a good soup, 
lifting the meat out when cooked and serving with vegetables 
and horseradish sauce. The stock left may be utilized next 
day as a rice or julienne soup. 

Remember when buying meat for a stew, braize or pot- 
roast, it is better economy to pay twelve cents a pound for 
solid, juicy meat than it would be to pay seven cents for a 
larger piece which is half bone and fat. It is the same economy 
that makes the good housewife choose a pound and a half 
of solid halibut at twenty cents a pound rather than a five- 
pound cod with skin, head and tail included at six cents a 
pound. 

Among the cheap and nourishing meats yet to mention 
one might include corned beef, with its cabbage accompani- 
ment, and boiled tongue, which in small towns and villages 
can be bought very cheap. The aitchbone sells generally at 
ten to twelve cents a pound and is the best bit of beef for a 
stew. Next to it come several pounds from the middle cut of 
the skin, the flank of a large sirloin roast or the upper part of 



ECONOMY IN MARKETING AND COOKING 77 

the chuck rib. Good pieces of the round, which accumulate 
in small, unsightly portions on every butcher's counter, cost 
little and, by the aid of the household meat chopper, can be 
converted into Hamburg steak. I have something of a preju- 
dice against market Hamburg steak, preferring to see with 
my own eyes the meat which goes through the chopper. It costs 
less and adds a relish to sausage when it, too, is homemade. 

Odd pieces of pork can be had for the watching and at 
low cost in every market. For the people who like it, tripe 
provides an occasional good and cheap meal. Three or four 
pounds of lamb from the forequarter costs ten cents a pound, 
and is nutritious as a fricassee with brown gravy or as an 
Irish stew. Nothing makes a nicer stew or broth than a neck 
of mutton, one of the cheapest cuts of the sheep. Then in 
pork there is the old-fashioned, savory dish of spare ribs 
stuffed, while in veal rich stews may be made from the 
knuckle when cooked for a soup after the method suggested 
in the making of beef stock. 

THE CUTS OF MEAT 

The method of dividing up the carcasses of slaughtered 
animals varies considerably in different localities. The ac- 
companying diagrams illustrate the cuts generally made. On 
Plates V to X inclusive will be found illustrations of all the 
principal steaks and roasts of beef and lamb chops. 

MAKING THE MOST OF MEATS 

A famous chef once described tersely the slow, simmer- 
ing process required by a stew or soup. He said: "Never 
allow the water to laugh, let it smile — smile slightly." If 
every cook could be made to understand what "smiling" means, 
we would have cheap, tough meat appearing before us made 
so tender that it would scarcely require a sharpened knife. 
Instead of this we have expensive cuts which carve with the 
consistency of shoe leather simply because they have boiled 
at a broad grin.

THE HOME COOK BOOK 



If meats which have been boiled be left with the lid off, 
to cool in their own stock, they will be much more tender and 
juicy than if lifted from the boiling pot liquor to the platter. 

Corned beef is much improved by being cooked the day

before it is to be used. Let it cool off in its liquor, then 
cover, and when needed reheat slowly. Do not allow the 
liquor to boil, simply allow it to continue at the simmering 
point until the meat is heated through.

Do not pour the corned beef liquor away. Save it to keep 
the meat in until the last morsel has been used for hash. 
Corned beef cold which is kept in the liquor does not seem

like a piece of the same creature as when it is left to become 
dry and hard on an uncovered platter. 

A piece of corned beef, even when rolled, frequently pre- 
sents a ragged, unsightly appearance. Take a pair of sharp, 
clean scissors, such as ought to hang in every pantry, and

trim the meat into presentable shape. Set the trimmings 
away to be used as hash. 

When a smoked ham is about half used up, steam what 
is left on the smaller end. Wash, and soak it in cold water 
for an hour, then steam for five or six hours, setting the meat 
cut side down on a plate in the steamer. If it is to be served 
hot, the ham will be improved by browning it in the oven 
after steaming. 

A leg of mutton, when boiled, ought to cook rather quickly 




Diagram of Cuts of Mutton 

for ten or fifteen minutes, then set it where the liquor will 
scarcely bubble, until it is tender. An ordinary leg of mut- 
ton, about eight or ten pounds in weight, requires about two 
hours to simmer. 

If there is a scant amount of meat for a braize or stew, 
add a few cups of tiny potato balls about half an hour before 
taking from the oven. They improve the appearance of a 



80 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

dish and taste delicious. The shells of potato left over when 
the balls are cut may be put in cold water until required, then 
boiled and mashed. 

A brown gravy adds much to the appetizing flavor of pork 
chops. Pour off the greater portion of the pork fat in Ae 
spider and put in two tablespoons of flour. Stir till quite 
brown, then add very slowly a cup and a half of boiling water. 
Season with salt and paprika and beat till creamy with a wire 
whisk. If not brown enough add a tablespoon of kitchen 
bouquet and strain over the chops. 

A steak which from its looks raises disturbing thoughts 
of toughness may, in the course of twenty-four hours, be 
changed to something of the texture of tenderloin. Mix four 
tablespoons of oil with two tablespoons of vinegar and pour 
over the steak, laid on a platter. See that the mixture wets 
every portion of the meat, then allow it to marinate in a very 
cold place. In the cold-storage room of great hotels one might 
(if admitted) find steaks which would be scarcely fit to chew 
marinating for days before they are required. They appear 
under all sorts of steak appellations and pass very easily with 
the uninitiated as tenderloin. 

Never broil the flank end of a sirloin steak; it is impos- 
sible to eat it as steak. Cut it off before the steak is cooked. 
It may be slowly simmered and make a nice little stew ; it can 
be boiled and used as hash or chopped raw for a breakfast 
Hamburg steak. 

When there are children in a household who care more for 
gravy than meat, as most children do, a few pounds of tough, 
juicy meat carefully cooked till tender will yield plenty of 
excellent gravy. With the gravy, baking-powder biscuit may 
frequently be served. It goes especially well with veal -stew 
or a cream gravy, which may be had in abundance when stew- 
ing a somewhat tough old fowl. I always prefer biscuit to 
dumplings. It takes a very careful cook to make light dump- 
lings ; almost before a second helping they will grow cool and 
heavy. Besides, for cold dumplings one can find no possible 
use, while baking-powder biscuit is as good cold as hot.

TO MAKE AND USE ASPIC JELLY 

THIS jelly is a pretty setting out of meats and it requires 
little skill and costs but little. Lately it has had popular- 
ity. Soak half a box of gelatine in half a cup of cold water for 
half an hour. Take a pint of consomme or stock, or, if you 
do not have either, a teaspoon of beef extract in a pint of 
water. With this simmer a teaspoon of onion- juice, a bay 
or thyme leaf, and a stalk of celery while the gelatine is soak- 
ing. Add the gelatine, season with salt and pepper, and set 
away to cool if you wish to cut it in blocks and use it to 
garnish salad. If you wish to inclose in it pieces of chicken, 
turkey, beef, slices of tongue, or fish, pour the liquid jelly little 
by little about the meat until it is inclosed, giving time for 
each layer to harden. Keep the mold in the ice-box until 
ready to serve. Then dip the mold in warm water, cover it 
with the face of a platter, turn over, having the mold upside 
down, and the jelly will slip out. Parsley, lettuce, etc., may 
be inclosed with the meat. 

BROWNED FLOUR 

Put the flour to be browned into a pie pan or skillet. Set 
on the stove and as the flour begins to brown stir constantly 



^ THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and brown evenly. Let it become a light brown. It is well 
to keep this browned flour in a small glass jar or covered 
tin can and have it ready for use. 

TO THICKEN A GRAVY WITH FLOUR 

Mix flour with water, making a smooth paste. Thin to 
the consistency of cream and be careful to have no lumps. 
While the gravy boils pour in this flour and water. Allow 
it to boil up a moment, and remove from the fire to serve. 

DUMPLINGS FOR MEATS 

Sift two teaspoons of baking powder and half a teaspoon 
of salt into two cups of flour. Wet with a .tup of milk, 
stirring and beating lightly and quickly with a spoon. Do 
not put on a board or roll, but drop from the spoon in spoon- 
fuls into the boiling chicken or beef liquor. Put on the kettle 
cover at once, set a weight on it, and boil rapidly, if the dump- 
lings are small, twelve minutes. Lay on a hot dish and serve 
at once. Cold air makes the dumplings fall, therefore if you 
have to keep them a second for the meat, set them in the 
oven. 

CORN DUMPLINGS FOR MEATS 

Upon half a cup of com meal pour a pint of boiling milk, 
stirring rapidly. Put in a double-boiler and let cook and 
thicken for half an hour. Then stir in half a teaspoon of 
salt, a teaspoon of baking powder, and two eggs. Form into 
small balls, using flour on the hands, and drop into your kettle 
of boiling beef, corned beef, or mutton ten minutes before 
taking off the fire. Skim out of the broth with a skimmer, 
and serve with the meat. 

The dumplings may be tied, with room for swelling, in 
small cloths, wetted, and floured. If you use the cloths you 
are sure none will dissolve in the meat liquor. Allow more 
time using the cloths, twenty minutes to half an hour. 



BEEF AND VEAL 88 

DUMPUNGS FOR BOILED RUMP OF BEEF 

Mix a heaping teaspoon of lard lightly through a pint and 
a half of sifted flour, using the ends of the fingers for mix- 
ing. Add an even teaspoon of salt, two heaping teaspoons of 
baking powder, a beaten egg, and two tablespoons of hot 
water. Beat thoroughly. Add more hot water, little by 
little, until you have the dough stiff enough to work into 
oblong pieces, dipping your spoon constantly into the flour 
and shaping with it. Drop the pieces in the hot liquor, cover 
close, and boil slowly fifteen minutes. Do not fork or turn. 
Serve the moment they are done, put in a hot dish to keep 
them from chill and falling. 

BRINE FOR CORNING BEEF 

When you have your beef ready for coming be sure it is 
perfectly cold and free from animal heat. It should lie pro- 
tected from flies or any attacking insect and become solid. 
Two full days of cool weather should be allowed for this. 

Have your coming firkin or barrel of clean, sweet, firm 
wood. Then have it perfectly scoured, and set upon logs so 
that air can pass between its bottom and the cemented floor 
of the cellar. Have also flat, square, scoured boards to put 
in over the meat to keep it from floating. Smooth, large, 
clean stones should be at hand for weights on the boards. 

In making the brine use a big kettle, or take the wash- 
boiler, scour it perfectly, and use that. 

Weigh out twenty pounds of coarse salt, two pounds of 
sugar (or two quarts of pure New Orleans molasses), and use 
half a pound of saltpetre. Measure fourteen gallons of 
water. Put all these ingredients into the kettle or boiler, set 
over the fire, and when the scum begins to rise begin to skim. 
By the time the brine boils you will have it clear. After it 
boils a few minutes set it from the fire to cool. 

Pack your beef in the barrel so that the brine may run 
easily between the pieces of meat, lay on top your boards 
and stones, and pour over the cold brine. 



M THE HOME COOK BOOK 

If after a week or two a scum appears on the brine, take 
out the meat, scald the brine, and pack anew. 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF 

Corned beef is often spoiled through ignorance of the 
right way to cook it. In the first place it is well to note that 
small and moderate-sized pieces require about the same time 
for cooking. Wash off the brine from your piece, and into 
a kettle having enough boiling water to well cover it drop the 
beef. When the scum begins to rise, as the meat heats 
through, skim it off, and after the meat has begun to boil, 
move the kettle to the back part of the stove. Keep it gently 
boiling four or five hours — ^usually the longer time — and 
when the meat is done lift it into an earthen jar or wooden 
bowl, pour over its liquor, and let it grow cold. This treat- 
ment makes a great difference in the taste of cold corned beef. 
The beef that is taken from its liquor and allowed to grow 
cold in the air is apt to be dry and tasteless, when the same 
piece would be sweet and wholesome if kept in its liquor and 
allowed to absorb the juices its liquor contains. 

If the meat is to be pressed, it can be as easily pressed 
in its liquor, by laying a plate and weights upon it, as out of 
its liquor. 

If some of the corned beef is to be eaten hot, serve it hot 
and then place to cool the remainder in its liquor. 

An authority of to-day insists that by putting an un- 
peeled onion in the water in which corned beef is boiling, the 
meat is made more juicy and tender. 

CORNED BEEF HASH 

Chop cold corned beef quite fine, and chop, not so fine, 
potatoes cooked the day before, and therefore firm and cold. 
Take two pint cups of chopped meat and three and a half 
pint cups of chopped potatoes. Put them in a saucepan with 
enough hot water to show through the hash, add a piece of 
butter the size of an egg, also salt and pepper to taste, and 



BEEF AND VEAL 85 

cook gently, allowing the hash to brown upon the bottom 
of the iron saucepan and scraping up the browned hash to 
let other parts brown. When done add one slightly heaping 
teaspoon of mustard, which has been mixed rather thick with 
water, salt, and a little sugar. Serve very hot and quite dry. 

BEEF HASH 

Beef hash is not best made from cold roasts and other 
cold meats. To succeed you need to have a fresh round 
steak and prepare as follows: Cut off some of the fat, put 
into a hot iron frying-pan. When the fat has fried out take 
out the suet remnants and put the steak in the frying-pan. 
Season a very little with salt and pepper, and have enough 
fat to prevent the meat sticking to the pan. Turn the steak 
from side to side until done. Be careful not to let the juice 
bum. If there is too much juice the meat will not brown. 
Pour off the juice and save it to add to the chopped meat. 
Brown the steak lightly and cook just done. Take it from 
the fire, cut all gristle and fat off, and chop quite fine. Turn 
into a pan until you have chopped the potatoes, which should 
have been cooked tender the day before. To chop, they 
must be cold and firm. Chop the potatoes rather coarse. 
When ready set the frying-pan on a table. It is a mistake 
to prepare food over a heated stove. Take two pint cups of 
chopped meat, put into the frying-pan, add three pint cups 
and a half of chopped potatoes. Next three pint cups and a 
half of oold water — about enough water to be even with the 
chopped hash. Stir with a spoon. Next add carefully pep- 
per and salt. In seasoning you will find the taste does not 
come for a second. Wait a moment, and have just enough 
pepper to slightly sting the tongue and just enough salt to 
have a good flavor. Add to- this a piece of butter one inch 
wide cut across a one pound roll of butter. Now set your 
frying-pan on the top of the stove, let it boil rather hard at 
first. This done for about ten minutes, set it back and cook 
steadily for one hour and a half, scraping up the hash with 



86 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the point of a large iron spoon to keep the meat from stick- 
ing or burning. Cook until rather dry, simply moist. To 
keep hot set an asbestos plate under it, and cover. Hash is 
good warmed over next day. Put it in a saucepan, if 
needed; add a little warm water. Set this saucepan in an- 
other of hot water, cover, and heat. 

BAKED BEEF HASH 

Grease a pie plate with butter; use the cold hash you 
have left over. Put it on the plate, and make it in a round 
shape with a spoon, and have it two or three inches high. 
Pour over this a very little melted butter, sprinkle a very 
little flour from a flour dredge, and brown in the oven. 
When brown, slip on a hot plate with the griddle turner. 

BEEF X LA MODE 

Take a round of beef and make a great many holes through 
it. Roll strips of raw salt pork in a seasoning made of half a 
teaspoon each of thyme, salt, pepper, and cloves. Then draw 



A Larding Needle 

these strips through the holes in the beef, or lard with a lard- 
ing needle. Put six onions, two tablespoons of milk, and one- 
quarter of a pound of butter in a saucepan. Stew the onions 
tender. Put beef, onions and all into a pot, with water just 
enough to cover them, and cook slowly five hours. Just 
before taking up, add a pint of claret if you choose, or omit 
the claret. 

TO BOIL FRESH TONGUE 

Follow the method given under "To Boil Corned Beef," 
with one exception — add three tablespoons of salt after the 
tongue has boiled an hour. 



BEEF AND VEAL 87 

TO BOIL PICKLED TONGUE 
Follow the directions for boiling corned beef. 

TO BOIL SMOKED TONGUE 

Use the receipt "To Boil a Ham" on page 119. Omit, 
however, the spice, sugar and thyme, and do not brown it in 
the oven. 

BOILED RUMP OF BEEF 

Take six pounds of fat beef rump, place in a pot, cover 
with cold water, and set over a moderate fire. When it 
boils ^kim, and then boil four hours very slowly. Do not 
add salt until it has boiled two hours. Boil very tender. 
When done, take up the meat, lay it in a colander and set it 
over a saucepan of hot water to keep it moist. Next strain 
all the liquor, take out two cups for gravy, and put in a sauce- 
pan. Dissolve two teaspoons of flour, stir smooth, and stir 
gradually into the gravy until it is thick as cream. If the 
flour lumps, strain through a strainer. Serve in a pitcher. If 
you want dumplings, make according to the receipt given on 
page 83. Put the liquor remaining after that used for the 
gravy in a large saucepan to boil the dumplings. If you 
have jcold meat left, set it away in the liquor in an earthen 
jar and it will not become hard. 

SPICED RUMP OF BEEF, INCLUDING SOUP 

Put six or seven pounds of the rump of beef into a flat- 
bottomed porcelain or granite kettle. Set on top of the stove. 
Pour over this just enough water to cover it. Let it slowly 
come to boil. Skim well. Scrape two large or four small 
carrots and split them down the centre. Add these and two 
large onions cut in half, and one red pepper. Tie up, in a 
small square piece of cloth, allspice, a few cloves, sweet mar- 
joram and thyme, and throw into the water. Boil very stowly 
four hours until tender. The second hour add salt to taste. 
When done, take out some of the liquor and make a gravy as 



88 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

thick as cream. Thicken with two teaspoons of flour dis- 
solved in cold water. If the flour lumps, strain through a wire 
strainer. Pour the liquor off into a stone crock, and set in a 
cold place. Next day skim off the grease. The liquor will 
have jellied. Take some of this, put into a saucepan set in 
another of hot water, and heat, and you have a delightful 
clear soup. Worcestershire sauce can be added. Serve with 
salt crackers, slightly heated. 

DAUBE 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Have three pounds of round of beef cut short and thick. 
Lard it with long thin pieces of fat pork, slipping in a thin 
sliver of garlic clove with each piece of pork. Peel and 
slice thin two white turnips, two white onions, and scrape 
and slice four carrots. Mix one tablespoon of salt with half 
a teaspoon of cayenne and two tablespoons of sugar. Rub 
the meat thoroughly with this. Place in a large yellow bowl 
a layer each of the sliced vegetables until half are used. 
Next place in the meat. Lay over this the remainder of the 
vegetables. Pour over this half a pint of cider vinegar and 
the remaining salt, pepper, and sugar. Cover with a cloth 
and plate, placing a weight on the plate. Let stand over 
night in a cold place. In the morning remove the meat from 
the liquor which has formed during the night, roll it in flour, 
brown it in a deep pot (a stone casserole is best) in which 
you have two tablespoons of boiling drippings. Add your 
vegetables, which you have strained and chopped fine, also 
half a pint of strained canned tomatoes. Add the juice of 
the meat from the bowl for gravy. If not enough to cover 
the meat add sufiicient water to make it. Season with 
thyme, one pod of red pepper, one large bay leaf, the juice 
of half a lemon, a couple of allspice, and one or two cloves. 
Let come to boil, and then allow to simmer about six hours. 
Slow cooking is the secret of the success of this dish. If 
any be left over, put the meat in the centre of a mold, add 



BEEF AND VEAL 89 

some melted geiatine to the gravy, boil it up once or twice, 
pour over the meat, and set aside to jelly. You have a 
delicious mousse which is used with crisp white lettuce and 
mayofmatse dressif^. Boiled rice is usually served with 
hot daube. Daube is a dish much used among Spanish

A SPANISH DISH COOKED IN LOUISIANA 

Boil two pounds of shin of beef, the liquor will do for 
soup stock. When the shin is cold cut off the best part of 
the meat in thin slices. Season with salt and red pepper. 
JPut the gristle and remaining meat in a separate dish. Slice 
and slightly fry two onions in a tablespoon of butter. Stir 
in two tablespoons of flour. When brown add one quart of 
tomatoes. To this add the remaming meat and gristle, 
which you have cut as fine as possible. Cook slowly for one 
hour. Add the sliced meat, also a dash of English mustard. 
Cook quarter of an hour longer. Just before dishing add a 
teaspoon of minced parsley, a little garlic, and one minced 
sweet pepper. Dish half for immediate use; put the rest 
in a mold to jelly. 

TO BROIL A BEEFSTEAK 

Choose a steak otie inch thick at least, and better an inch 
and a half thick. The sirloin or tenderloin is the best See 
that the steak is clean, and wipe it with a damp cloth. If you 
have a wood or coal fire let it be in the form of a bed of 
hot coals, and over it heat your broiler. When the broiler is 
hot rub it with a bit of suet and lay on it the steak. As soon 
as one side has seared over the glowing coals, turn and sear 
the odier side. By Ihis quick searing at first you keep the 
jukes of the meat from flowing out and wasting. After this 
first qukk searing turn the steak often till cooked. Do not 
dry up the steak. Allow about ten minutes for the cooking 
of a thick steak and less time if the steak is thinner. When 



90 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the steak is cooked sprinkle lightly with salt on each side, and 
lay on a hot platter. A few pieces of butter may be laid on 
it, or not, as the taste directs. 

Over a gas flame a beefsteak may be broiled in a hot iron 
saucepan. This is called a pan broil. Be sure your pan is 
hot, and then proceed as if over coals, first rubbing the pan 
with suet and then laying the steak in the pan. A complete 
gas stove has a broiling oven where the flame plays upon the 
meat, and proves an excellent broiler. Light the gas and 
heat the broiler before you rub it with suet, and put in the 
steak. Proceed then as directed for broiling over jqoals. 

CHOPPED STEWED BEEF 

Have two pounds of round steak. Heat a frying-pan, lay 
in it pieces of the fat of the steak and fry out the grease. 
Take out the fat, lay the steak in the frying-pan, pepper and 
salt a very little, and brown, turning from side to side until 
cooked a little rare. When done take out the meat, cut off 
the gristle and fat that is left, chop very fine, season with 
more pepper and salt, add a tablespoon of Worcestershire 
sauce, a tablespoon of tomato catsup, a dessertspoon of 
melted butter, and some sprigs of chopped parsley or a little 
chopped celery, or both. Cover with water, stew slowly and 
steadily for one hour and a half. A little more water can be 
added, if required. When the meat is done mix one tea- 
spoon of flour in cold water, smooth, stir it in the meat, and 
let boil a moment to thicken. If wished, half a teaspoon of 
onion-juice may be added.

have small quantity of gravy add a tablespoon of butter, for 
richness. Thicken with flour dissolved in water, let boil a 
little thick, set back, and it is ready for the pie. 'Make a pie 
or biscuit crust, roll a moderately thick piece, line a pudding 
dish, and pour into it the meat. Roll the upper crust half an 
inch thick, roll again, sprinkle with flour, and fold the four 
sides over. Roll again, and cut strips half an inch thick and 
the same in width. Lay each way over the pie like a lattice ; 
or, if you prefer it, make a whole cover of paste and cut 
several holes in the centre. Bake to a nice brown in a quick 
oven. 

BAKED MEAT PIE 

Cut pieces of cold meat the size of dice. Lay them in a 
baking or pudding dish, and add two or three chopped 



94 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

onions, pepper, salt, and a tablespoon of dry pulverized sage 
or some other tasteful garden herb. Take the giavy you 
have left of the meat or the remains of a soup, thicken with 
flour and pour over the meat, and then cover all with

thoroughly with hot milk and a seasoning of butter, salt, 
and pepper, form into a crust to fit over the meat, spread 
on and bake in a welKheated oven till the potato has a crust 
of brown. 

POT ROAST 

Rib, sirloin, or rump can be used, as preferred. Have the 
beef bone taken out and the meat rolled, and skewered to hold 
it in shape. Put it into a round-bottom poL Brown the beef 
first on one side and then on the other, then add one pint of 
boiling water and a piece of suet. Salt when the meat is half 
done. Cover very tight and cook very tender. Add no more 
water. When done pour out the liquor, and thicken with 
browned flour, a tablespoon, perhaps, or more stirred into the 
gravy, to which you may have to add some water. When 
thickened, strain and add a little pepper. 

ROAST BEEF 

The best pieces for roasting are the porterhouse, rib, and 
sirloin. Place the meat in a baking-pan on a wire frame 
which comes for that purpose, and sprinkle it lightly with 
pepper. Have salted water in the bottom of the pan and an 
onion cut in half. Turn the meat two or three times while 



BEEF AND VEAL 



95 



roasting, baste every ten minutes, in order to have the meat 
juicy, and allow fifteen minutes to every pound. Serve with 
gravy, 

ROAST BEEF GRAVY 

Brown some flour a light color, dissolve two tablespoons 
or more of the browned flour in cold water, stir smooth, and 
add to the gravy water used in basting. Boil slowly, stirring 




Dripping-Pan with Basting Ladle 

constantly until the gravy is slightly thick. If there be any 
lumps, strain through a strainer. It is then ready for use. 

ROAST BEEF STEW 

Slice cold roast beef in thin pieces. Cut off all the fat 
except a very little that may cling to the pieces. Slice, wash, 
and lay in an iron frying-pan four or five medium-sized 
onions cut in thin slices. Cover with enough water to boil 
tender. When done, put in the beef, add whatever cold gravy 
you have left from the roast beef. Add water enough to 
cover the meat. Pepper and salt carefully to taste, add one 
tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and three of tomato cat- 
sup. Let this boil slowly one hour, then thicken it with flour 
dissolved in cold water stirred very smooth. Pour into the 
middle of the stew some of the mixed flour. Stir very 
quickly with the back of a large spoon to prevent lumping. 
Boil up and serve hot. 

SCALLOPED BEEF 

Meat for scalloping may be either minced or cut in small 
slices. Put a layer in a greased baking dish and season it 



96 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

to your taste with salt and pepper, adding minced onion if 
you wish and covering the layer with gravy. Next strew 
fine breadcrumbs and lay over them small bits of butter, and 
sprinkle grated cheese. If you have material repeat the 
layers. Bake in a hot oven till the top layer of breadcrumbs 
is brown, and serve with a tCMuato sauce, with pickles or 
with horseradish. 

TO COOK SMOKED BEEF 

Have the smoked beef cut very thin. Put the quantity 
needed in a granite frying-pan. Cover with cold water. As 
soon as it comes to boil, pour oflf the water. Cover with 
milk, add a little salt and a very little pepper. Taste for 
seasoning. Have ready flour and water mixed smooth, 
allowing a tablespoon of flour to a cup of milk. Pour gradu- 
ally into the middle of the hot milk. Stir well with the back 
of the spoon at first, and stir again to mix. Let boil slowly, 
stirring constantly until the milk thideens. When thick 
enough take off the fire and add a tablespoon of butter. 
Serve in a hot dish. 

CREAMED DRIED BEEF 

Have half a pound of dried beef sliced thin. Break it in 
small bits. Let it stand five minutes in cold water which is 
gradually growing lukewarm, then drain. Put it in a sauce- 
pan and add a pint of milk. As the milk heats add slowly two 
large spoons of flour dissolved in half a cup of cold water. 
Cook till the milk thickens. Take from the fire, stir in a 
beaten egg, tip on a hot platter, drop small pieces of butter 
over the whole, sprinkle with pepper, and serve hot 

STEWED BEEF OR VEAL TONGUE 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Use one large fresh beef tongue or two or three veal 
tongues. Boil the tongue half an hour. Strain the water 



BEEF AND VEAL 97 

for gravy. Remove the skin and gristle from the tongue, 
leaving any pieces of sweetbread which may be attached. 
Roll the tongue in flour and brown it in a deep saucepan or 
casserole m which you have two tablespoons of bculing drip- 
poigs. Add two teacups of canned tomatoes, one minced 
onion, three sliced carrots, four sliced potatoes, and six small 
white onions. Fill the casserole with the strained water, add 
one bay leaf» a pinch of thyme> one red pepper pod, and half 
a teaspoon of salt. Allow to simmer three hours. Serve 
with the vegetables placed around the tongues, and the gravy 
in a separate dish. 

The dish may be varied by the addition of a teaspoon of 
mustard mixed into the gravy. 

VEAL CUTLETS 

Have the cutlets cut a little more than half an inch thick. 
Roll soda crackers very fine. Beat one egg or more. To 
one egg add a tablespoon of cold water. Lay the rolled 
cracker on a pie plate, the egg in a smaller pan. Season the 
cracker highly with salt to taste, and red pepper. Cut the 
veal in pieces ready to serve. Dip each piece first in the egg 
and then roll over and over in the cracker. Put in a frying- 
pan a number of pieces of pickled pork cut in thin slices. 
Fry out the fat, and brown on both sides. When brown take 
out, and lay on a hot platter. Now put the veal in the fat 
and add a large lump of butter. Cook very slowly, turn as 
it browns lightly, and do not allow it to brown enough to be 
hard. Cook until well done. If more fat is needed, add 
butter and a little lard. When done lay the pieces of veal 
on the hot platter, and pour the fat over it, without any 
thickening at all. 

VEAL FILET 

Have your butcher take out the bone and make a deep cutj 
or you can do it yourself. Fill the cut with dressing made 
as follows: Two cups of breadcrumbs, one-half cup of 

S Vol. 2 



98 THE -HOME COOK BOOK 

chopped pork, a little lemon peel grated, the juice of a 
lemon, and pepper, salt, onions, and sage to taste, wetting all 
with cold water. Then bend the veal into a round form, 
fasten with skewers, sprinkle over salt and pepper and set 
in a well-heated oven for a two to three hours' roast Baste 
well and often with butter and water. Just before it is done, 
sprinkle over a little flour and baste again. When done, add 
to the gravy a little thickening and some lemon-juice, if liked. 



Skewen far Meat irut Pouhrf 

Strain the gravy, remove the grease that rises to the top, and 
serve in a gravy dish. 

Broiled or boiled ham cut in small pieces serves well with 
this meat 

GRILLARD OF VEAL 

A NEW ORLEANS t>lSH 

Cut in pieces like cutlets and beat two pounds of round 
steaks of veal. Lay in a deep china plate and pour over one 
tablespoon of cider vinegar, a teaspoon of salt and black 
pepper mixed in the vinegar. Have a deep saucepan or 
skillet very hot, and put in one large tablespoon of drippings. 
When this is smoking hot, throw in the cutlets, and be 
careful to make them lie flat Cook quickly. When browned 



BEEF AND VEAL 99 

take the cutlets from the skillet. To the hot drippings add 
an even tablespoon of sifted flour. When brown add one 
small minced onion, and to the browned flour and onion 
return your cutlets, adding one teacup of strained canned 
tomato, a pinch of summer savory, a little minced garlic, 
and salt and pepper to taste. Cook very slowly for half an 
hour. Serve the cutlets on slices of thin toast; pour gravy 
over all. 

VEAL LOAF 

Take a pound weight of cold pieces of veal — it matters 
not if the meat is coarse — ^and mince as fine as possible. 
Take also the last shavings of a boiled ham or fat part of 
the ham, and chop small. Mix the ham and veal well to- 
gether, add half a cup of grated breadcrumbs, the juice of 
half a lemon, and half a cup of the thick gravy of the veal. 
Add also a little salt and cayenne to taste, and a dust of 
powdered mace. Mix thoroughly again, and press into a 
mold or bowl upon which you can set a weight. Keep cool, 
and serve next day after you have tipped the meat from the 
mold. 

If you wish to serve the veal loaf hot and at once, do as 
follows: After you have mixed the ingredients thoroughly, 
make the meat in the form of a loaf, strew bread or cracker 
crumbs over it, and heat it through thoroughly in a slow 
oven. Send the loaf to the table in a deep dish, and after 
you have poured round it gravy left from the first cooking 
of the veal. 

VEAL PATTIES 

Chop fine some scraps of cold roast veal — ^the remains of 
a fillet are often convenient — and add, chopping with it, bits 
of cold ham or cold smoked tongue. Add also yolks of 
hard-boiled eggs, the two or three of which you have used 
the whites for some other cooking. Season with salt, a little 
pepper, and moisten a little with the cold gravy of the veal. 
Roll out thin some puff paste, and cut it in circular form 



100 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

about the size of a teaplate. Upon one-half of this round 
piece thickly spread the meat mixture, fold over the other 
half, and pinch the edges of the pastry together. Cut one or 
two small openings in the top, lay the patties on a floured 
pan, and bake in a moderately quick oven. Served with 
drawn butter and mashed potatoes, these patties are deli- 
cious. 

VEAL POTPIE_ 

Allow three pounds of veal, of either the leg or loin, to 
half a pound of salt pork. Cut the veal in pieces about two 
inches square, and the pork in thin slices. In the bottom of 
the pot in which you cook the potpie lay a few slices of 
pork. Next put in a layer of pieces of veal, and again pork, 
and next veal, till you use your material. Cover the meat 
with lukewarm water, and bring it very slowly to boil. Boil 
slowly about an hour and a half — perhaps it will take more 
time, perhaps less; it depends upon the condition of your 
veal. When the meat is slightly tender and needs about 
twenty minutes more to be perfectly done, drop dumpling 
dough (see page 82) from a spoon into the boiling liquor. Do 
not let the boiling stop, but boil steadily for fifteen minutes 
or perhaps twenty if your dumplings are large. Then on 
a hot platter lay the meat with the dumplings about it. Boil 
the gravy liquor hard, and for thickening stir in flour worked 
smooth in a little cold water. Season to taste. Pour gravy 
over the meat and put what is left in a gravy bowl. Serve 
the whole hot and as fast as you can. The dumplings should 
be eaten at once. 

A couple of onions and a head of celery may be added 
to the veal in the first part of its cooking if the taste is for 
such seasoning.

CALF'S BRAIN CROQUETTES 

BOIL two pounds of veal until tender. Let it cool in its 
broth, and have as little broth as possible. Chop the veal 
fine. Put two sets of calf's brains in cold water to stand for 
one hour. Then drain carefully and take off all the skin and 
stringy part. Put them in hot water to boil, and boil until 
nice and firm. When partly :cool chop them fine, and add 
to the veal. Make into oblong croquettes. Have one egg 
beaten, with one tablespoon of cold water. Roll soda crackers 
fine. Season the cracker with salt and red pepper carefully. 
Dip the croquettes in the egg, and roll them in the rolled 
cracker. Get all the croquettes ready before frying. Fry in 
hot fat a nice brown, and use just enough lard to prevent them 
sticking. 

CALF'S BRAINS FRIED 

Brains should be well soaked in water, to remove the 
blood. Afterward cut in small pieces the size of an oyster, 
and fry in butter till well done. They make a delicate and 
choice dish. 

CALF'S BRAINS PICKLED 

After the brains are soaked cut them in pieces and gently 
boil them in milk twenty minutes. Strain off the milk and 



102 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pour over them delicately sour vinegar. They taste much 
like pickled oysters. 

STEWED CALF'S BRAINS 

Lay the brains in cold water for a short time and take 
off the skin. This done, put the brains in a granite stewpan, 
cover with cold water, and set on the back of the stove. 
Add a piece of onion the size of a nutmeg, and stew slowly 
until tender. When done pour off the water and leave out 
the onion. Now cover the brains with milk, season with 
red pepper and salt to taste, and stew fifteen minutes longer. 
Mash together a dessertspoon of butter and a dessertspoon 
of flour, add this to the milk, and stir while boiling slowly 
until it thickens. Lastly grate in this a very little nutmeg 
and two sprigs of chopped parsley. 

CALF'S FOOT JELLY 

The quantities here given are small, but you can easily 
double or quadruple them. Take a calf's foot, have it split 
in two and the bone cracked in several places so that the 
juices will easily cook out. Souse it freely in cold water, 
and set it over the fire in a pot of cold water — about a quart 
and three-quarters. Cover well, and bring to boil very slowly 
in order to draw the sweetness from the bone. When it 
boils skim and set where it will sleepily bubble and simmer 
for three or four hours. Take from the fire, pour through a 
colander, and set to cool. When cold take off the fat which 
rises to the top, and any coarse sediment at the bottom, heat 
in a porcelain saucepan, and add the grated yellow of half a 
lemon, the juice of the lemon, a small blade of mace, a short 
stick of cinnamon, and a cup of sugar. If you wish their 
flavor, add also a little ginger and a clove, but the jelly is as 
well without them. Lastly stir in the beaten white of an egg, 
cook together gently six or seven minutes, and strain twice 
through a jelly bag. Pour into molds or into small glasses 
from which the jelly may be eaten. Cool thoroughly, and 
serve. 



CALF*S HEAD, HEART 108 

STEWED CALF'S HEAD 

Have the butcher prepare the head for use. When it 
comes to you, wash it thoroughly and remove the brains, 
which may be cooked separately according to the directions 
following or may be included in the stew you are about to 
make. Put the head in a pot, cover it with cold water, take 
off the scum that rises as the meat heats, and boil it gently 
for one or two hours, until it is tender. Take it from the 
fire, let it cool, and carefully take out all the bones. Put 
back all the meat in a pot or stewpan, add the brains if you 
wish to stew them, add also a little salt and cayenne pepper, 
and the liquor in which it was boiled, and let it stew slowly 
for an hour. You may serve the meat without further addi- 
tions, merely thickening the gravy with a little flour or corn- 
starch if it seems thin. 

If, however, you wish to make the meat a little less simple, 
add half an hour before serving a pint of mushroom buttons. 
If you do not have the mushrooms, a handful of finely 
minced sage is a pleasant addition. Or if you prefer capers 
or green nasturtium seed pickled, they also are good. 

Forcemeat balls are also an agreeable accompaniment to 
meat of the calf's head. 

STUFFED HEART WITH OYSTER DRESSING 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Use veal or lambs' hearts; four are sufficient. Remove 
the muscle from the centre of each heart. Boil them in 
salted water for one hour. To make the dressing : In a sauce- 
pan have one tablespoon of boiling butter. Add a tablespoon 
of flour, and when browned one minced onion, allowing it 
to brown slightly. Add one teacup of oyster- juice and two 
teacups of cracker crumbs. Season with a pinch of thyme, 
some cayenne pepper, and half a teaspoon of salt. Stir con- 
stantly to prevent burning. Last of all add one dozen 
cheeped oysters. Allow the dressing to cook until quite dry. 

Stuff the hearts with this dressing, and lay them in a 



104 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

baking-pan. Dust a little flour over each heart and lay 
across each one a slice of bacon. Bake fifteen minutes, bast- 
ing with tomato-juice. 

LAMB HEARTS AND LIVERS 

Wash, clean, cut in small pieces, and gently stew till done 
two lamb hearts and livers. Take them from the liquor in 
which they have stewed, chop fine, and add a few bread- 
crumbs, a flavor of parsley and onion, and salt to your taste. 
Put back into their liquor and stew them till the liquor is 
boiled down to a gravy. Then put in a baking dish and set 
in a moderate oven half an hour. Serve in the baking dish 
and garnish with rings or slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

KIDNEY STEW 

Wash very thoroughly two beef kidneys and remove the 
fat. Cut them in thin slices and put in a quart of cold 
water. Parboil, throw away the water, put in fresh water, 
and boil gently two hours. Then season with salt and pepper, 
and thicken with flour to form a smooth gravy. Serve on a 
platter surrounded by a wall of mashed potato, or ladle upon 
pieces of toast. 

KIDNEY STEW WITH CREAM GRAVY 

A SOUTHERN DISH 

Use lamb or veal kidneys. Boil two pairs of kidneys until 
tender, changing the water twice. To one pint of boiling 
milk or cream add one minced onion, one teaspocm of 
minced parsley, one clove of minced garlic, some red pepper 
and half a teaspoon of salt. Add one tablespoon of butter and 
the kidneys, which you have sliced thin. 

Thicken with two tablespoons of flour stirred smooth in 
water, and serve on thin toast 

KIDNEYS A LA TERRAPIN 

Use six lamb kidneys, or half a beef kidney. First wash 
and then put in cold water enough to cover them, and bring 



CALF'S LIVER 105 

the water to boil. Repeat this. Then boil gently till the 
kidneys are tender. If you use the small lamb kidneys they 
will cook tender in less than an hour. Chop the kidneys till 
they are small dice, and to them add one hard-boiled egg, 
minced. Now make a sauce by blending a tablespoon of 
butter and a tablespoon of flour and adding it to a cup of 
hot milk in a double-boiler. Let the sauce cook till it thick- 
ens, and then salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the chopped 
kidney and egg, and just before serving on small pieces of 
brown toast stir in two tablespoons of wine or one of lemon- 
juice. 

. BAKED CALF'S LIVER 

A SOUTHERN DISH 

Dust with flour two pounds of liver, which you have 
bought whole. Lay it in a deep earthen baking-pan. Sea- 
son with pepper and salt and one minced onion, and lay 
across the top half a dozen slices of bacon. Add two cups of 
tomato-juice, with which you baste the liver while it is baking. 
Bake in a moderate oven until the liver is tender enough to 
pierce with a fork. Before serving squeeze the juice of half 
a lemon over the whole. 

LIVER BALLS 

Parboil half a pound of liver. Chop fine, chopping with 
it a slice of bacon. Mix in a teaspoon of chopped capers or 
nasturtium seed, a teaspoon of chopped cucumber pickles, a 
tablespoon of chopped onion, a teaspoon of salt, and a little 
pepper. Add a beaten egg to serve to hold all the ingredients 
together, mold into balls, roll in cracker crumbs and fry in 
a hot saucepan in which you have already fried crisp three 
or four slices of bacon. 

With this there may go well a salad of lettuce dressed

ing water. Take it out and wipe dry. Cttt in slices and 
season each slice separately with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 
lightly with flour, and lay on a pan, ready to fry. Have the 
frying-pan hot, put into it pieces of bacon, and thrown. When 
done take out and lay on a hot platter. Now drop the liver 
into the hot fat, turn often, and cook slowly until done, 
being carefvd not to cook long enough to harden or bum. 
If more fat is needed, add a little butter and lard. Lay the 
liver in the centre of the platter, the bacon around it, and 
pour the hot fat over it, without any thickening. 

FRIED CALF'S LIVER AND BACON 

Put in a frying-pan thin slices of bacon, and let them fry 
quickly in their own fat. Having carefully washed the calf 
liver, cut slices not too thin, say a third of an inch — for if 
liver is cut too thin it will fry dry and hard. Take out the 
bacon as soon as it is crisp, putting it in a hot dish. Lay the 
slices of the liver in the fat left in the frying-pan, and cook 
over not too hot a fire till thoroughly done. Then dish with 
the bacon, seasoning lightly with salt and pepper. 

Onions are sometimes served with fried liver. They may 
be parboiled and then sliced into the pan, seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and fried with the liver. Lay the bacon and 
onions on the liver as a garnish in serving. 

LIVER RISSOLES 

Take^a pound of calf liver, put it in hot water enough to 
cover, and boil it till tender. Take from the water, cool, and 
mince it fine, adding and mincing with it quarter of a pound 
of beef suet. Add quarter of a pound of fine or grated 
breadcrumbs, a pinch of cayenne, a little salt, and two eggs 
thoroughly beaten. Shape the meat in the form of corks or 
small eggs or large walnuts, and drop into boiling hot lard. 
As the rissoles brown skim them from the fat, lay them a 
minute to drain upon brown paper or a colander, and send 
to the table hot. 



SWEETBREADS 107 

TO CHOOSE AND PREPARE SWEETBREADS 

In picking out sweetbreads choose the larger, plumper> 
fleshier. Also be careful that they are perfectly fresh, for 
of all meats they stand keeping least well. Rinse and put 
them in lukewarm water to lie fifteen minutes. Then cover 
with slightly salted cold water, set on the fire, and bring to 
boil. When the water begins to boil drop them suddenly in 
a pan of cold water. The sudden change of temperature 
blanches them. Cut the sweetbreads apart, cut out the pipe, 
and take off the skin. They are now ready for creaming or 
other cooking. 

CREAMED SWEETBREADS 

Carefully choose a pair of fresh sweetbreads, trim off 
their fat, and follow the above directions for parboiling. 
Cut them in small pieces, and simmer twenty minutes in only 
enough water to make a steam. Then add a cup of rich 
milk, rub smooth a tablespoon of flour and a tablespoon of 
butter, moisten with some of the milk from the saucepan, 
add a pinch of salt, and stir all together over a moderate fire 
until the flour cooks and thickens. 

SWEETBREADS FRIED 

Wash and trim the sweetbreads, lay in a pan, and pour 
boiling water over them. Let stand for fifteen minutes. 
Beat one egg with one tablespoon of water, and have some 
cracker rolled fine and seasoned with salt and red pepper. 
Dip the sweetbreads first in the egg, and then in the cracker. 
Fry in just enough hot lard to cook, and brown nicely a 
light brown. 

SWEETBREADS WITH OYSTERS 

Wash free from skin and pipes and blanch the sweet- 
breads according to directions given above. 

Have at hand three dozen oysters. Put the sweetbreads 
in a saucepan, add the liquor from the oysters, add also two 



106 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

tablespoons of butter and set to simmer till the sweetbreads 
are done. When done pour in half a cup of cream into 
which a teaspoon of flour has been stirred. Bring to boil, 
drop in the oysters, and heat through or until the edges curl. 

SWEETBREADS WITH TOMATOES 

Stew a quart of tomatoes in a porcelain saucepan. When 
the tomatoes are thoroughly cooked, put them through a 
sieve and you will have a thick sauce. Have four sweet- 
breads cleaned, blanched, cut apart and ready for use, ac- 
cording to foregoing directions. Lay them in the tomato 
sauce, add salt, pepper, and nutmeg to your taste, and set 
over the fire. As the sauce heats add half a cup of butter 
into which you have stirred a tablespoon of flour. Let the 
sweetbreads cook in a gentle simmer in the tomatoes about 
forty minutes. Serve with buttered toast or without, as you 
prefer. 

SWEETBREADS STEWED 

Sweetbreads are stewed according to directions for ^'Stewed 
Calf *s Brains." Cut them in half to cook, and before the milk 
is added cut them in pieces a little smaller. 

TRIPE FRICASSEE 

AN ITALIAN DISH 

Cut into dice one pound of boiled tripe and lay in vinegar 
for ten minutes. Make boiling hot one tablespoon of butter 
in a deep casserole. Roll the tripe in flour and brown in the 
boiling butter. Add one minced onion, a pinch of rosemary, 
a dash of cayenne pepper, and half a teaspoon of salt. Add 
also two cups of strained canned tomatoes, also one teacup 
of beef or chicken soup, or water. Allow to simmer for ten 
minutes. Serve in a flat dish, and sprinkle over all two 
tablespoons of grated cheese. 

The Italians add one tablespoon of Marsala wine to the 
sauce when the dish is removed from the fire. 



TRIPE 109 

TRIPE FRICASSEE 

A PHILADELPHIA DISH 

To one pint of boiling milk or cream add one pound of 
boiled tripe which has been cut in pieces one inch square. 
Season with one minced onion, a teaspoon of minced parsley, 
a teaspoon of celery seed, a dash of cayenne pepper, half a 
teaspoon of salt, and three or four pieces of mace. Allow 
to simmer fifteen minutes. Thicken with two tablespoons of 
flour, stirred in one tablespoon of butter. Serve on thin 
toast 

FRIED TRIPE 

Select only the coarse honeycombed tripe. It is sold 
already boiled, but it is not tender. Put it in a saucepan, 
cover with cold salted water, and boil very tender. When 
done cut it into pieces three inches and a half long and two 
inches wide. Roll four soda crackers fine, and season with 
salt and red pepper to taste. Beat one egg with one table- 
spoon of cold water. Dip the tripe into the egg and then turn 
it over on both sides in the cracker. Have ready a frying- 
pan with hot lard and butter mixed, enough to cook the tripe 
slowly and a light brown. When done, lay the pieces on a 
hot platter, and pour three tablespoons of vinegar into the 
hot fat that is left Pour tiiis over the tripe, and serve.

—Scotch Hotchpotch— Lamb Stew 

BOILED MUTTON 

USE any part of the mutton you wish ; the shoulder is good. 
Put it in a granite soup kettle, cover with cold water, 
and skim when it boils. Boil slowly until done very tender, 
which may be three hours or more. Peel and cut in half, 
and add four large onions. Add also salt and pepper to 
taste, and a teacup of stewed and seasoned tomatoes. When 
done, take out the mutton and thicken the liquor with flour 
and water mixed smooth to the thickness of cream. Use 
this for gravy. 

BOILED LAMB 

Select the hindquarter. Wash in cold water, and wipe 
dry. Put into a granite kettle with salted water, enough to 
cover it. Boil gently until perfectly tender, which you will 
discover by probing with a fork, in the thickest part. It 
may take two hours. Be sure it is perfectly well done. 
Serve with drawn butter and eggs, or with caper sauce. 

TO BOIL A LEG OF MUTTON 

Take a "hung" but perfectly sweet leg of mutton. Wash, 
but do not soak it; put in a kettle in which it will fit 
well— one neither too large nor too small — and little more 
than cover it with cold water. Set the kettle over a moderate 
fire, and as the scum rises take it off. Next put in a table- 



MUTTON AND LAMB 111 

spoon of salty and add three onions and a bouquet made of 
thyme, summer savory, and parsley. Next put in four or 
five carrots, and after these have been heated through add 
as many peeled turnips. Now set the kettle on a spot where 
its contents will boil gently — ^simmer, merely gurgle slug- 
gishly — and let it stand with uninterrupted heat for two 
hours and a halL If it stews gently the mutton will be 
delicious. If it boils hard it will be leathery, tasteless rag, 
like all fast-boiled meats served up by ignorant, careless, 
or uneconomical housekeepers. Serve the leg of mutton 
on a hot platter with caper sauce, or oyster sauce, or nasturtium 
sauce. From the liquor in which the leg is cooked an excel- 
lent soup or bouillon is made. If in boiling the mutton you 
have any bones of mutton, veal, beef, put them in the pot and 
they increase the strength and tastiness of the soup. Let 
the liquor cool and remove the fat that rises to the top before 
you try to use for soup. 

BONED LEG OF MUTTON 

You can yourself cut the bone out of the leg, using a 
sharp, thin-pointed knife and scraping the flesh from the 
bone; or have it done at the market before the leg is sent to 
you. To fill in where the bone was removed, make a 
stuffing of breadcrumbs and chopped hard-boiled eggs, 




A French Kitchen Knife 

chopped salt-pickled pork, chopped onions if your taste 
allows, a sprinkling of powdered sage leaves, and a few 
pickled olives or capers. Salt and pepper must be at your 
discreticm* Force this dressing in the leg, tie it firmly, and 
roast in 'moderate oven several hours, not forgetting to baste 
the meat 



112 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

TO BROIL MUTTON CHOPS 

Choose thick chops, or have them cut thick — ^an inch or, 
better still, an inch and a half thick. Meat dealers will 
french chops for you if you wish; that is, they trim off the 
narrow meat from the rib, cut off the rib-bone so that only 
a part of it remains, and the large muscle rounding and 
nestling in the double-bone forms the chop. With your chop 
frenched or in ordinary form, proceed as in the directions 
for broiling beefsteak on page 89. In serving omit the butter, 
because the chop carries natural fat with it. 

LAMB CHOPS BROILED 

Trim from six lamb chops the fat and membrane on the 
edge — it is apt to impart a disagreeably woolly taste to the 
meat Melt some butter in a pie plate and dip the chops 
in it, covering every bit of the meat with the butter, dredge 
with flour, salt and pepper, lay in the broiler, and keep turning 
over a clear hot fire until the meat is done. Set the chops on 
their ends about a bouquet of parsley and serve immediately. 
[See illustration, Plate II.] 

BROILED CHOP FOR AN INVALID 

French a rib chop by scraping the long part of the bone 
until all fat is removed. Lay on a clean buttered paper the 
shape of the chop and cut double. Fold the edges of the 
paper over and together, thus forming a case. Place on a 
gridiron, broil six minutes, transfer from the case to a hot 
platter, and serve at once. 

TO SERVE COLD MUTTON 

While you are frying in a saucepan some hashed potatoes, 
cut large, thin slices from a piece of cold mutton. Lay the 
mutton round the centre of a platter, letting the pieces over- 
lap one another, and upon each piece drop a teaspoon of 
currant jelly. Tip the hot hashed potatoes in the centre of 
the platter and serve. 



MUTTON AND LAMB 113 

A good variation from the plain currant jelly is to whip 
half a glass of currant jelly with a teaspoon of made mus- 
tard until all is a froth, and drop this from a spoon upon the 
pieces of mutton. Easier than a fork for the beating is a 
regular egg-beater. 

MUTTON CROMESKIES 

Mince cold mutton and season it to your taste with minced 
onion, salt and pepper. On thin slices of bacon lay as much 
of the minced mutton as each slice will hold, in other words 
wrap spoonfuls of the mutton with thin slices of bacon. 
Fasten the bacon by using wooden toothpicks as skewers, 
thus forming cromeskies. Dip each of the cromeskies in a 
frying batter, or in a saucer of raw egg, and then into pow- 
dered cracker, drop in deep hot fat, and fry a delicate brown. 
Serve hot with mashed potato or with plain boiled rice. 

CROWN ROAST OF MUTTON 

The rack of mutton or lamb is used for this, and the roast 
IS cut from a loin, curled, and tied in the form of a crown. 
Or the crown form is obtained from corresponding ribs on 
either side of the animal being tied together and curled out- 
ward. The ribs are chopped apart at the backbone. The 
chops are frenched — ^that is, freed from meat toward the 
sharp end of the rib. The meat at this point may be cut off 
or scraped to fall over into the centrepiece of the crown. 
In the centre of the round roast lay chopped mutton or lamb 
well seasoned and mixed with breadcrtunbs in the proportion 
of one-third crumbs to two-thirds meat. Salt the roast and 
bake, basting often and allowing an hour and a quarter to 
an hour and a half. Serve with green peas and mashed 
potatoes. 

ROAST LAMB 

Select the fore or hind quarter, if the lamb is young 
(which it should be), to roast Wash in cold water, and dry 
with a cloth. Lay on a frame in the baking-pan, pepper and 



114 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

salt it, lightly rubbing the salt on. Set in a hot oven. Turn 
the meat from side to side as it cooks. Baste every ten 
minutes, and let it cook well done. Lamb should never be at 
all rare. Allow about twelve minutes to a pound in roasting. 
Serve with gravy or mint sauce. For gravy, strain the water 
the meat is cooked and basted with, and thicken with flour 
mixed with water and added before setting the pan on the 
stove. Stir constantly until the gravy pours nicely, and 
strain if at all lumpy. 

ROAST LAMB WITH KIDNEY 

Have the bone cut out of leg of a lamb, and fill in the 
hollow with kidney cooked tender, minced, mixed with bread- 
crumbs and well seasoned. If you have mushrooms, add a 
few to the stuffing. Roast in a hot oven and add nasturtium 
seeds or capers to the gravy. 

LEG OF MUTTON STUFFED 

Boil two or three white onions until tender. Chop them 
in a bowl with breadcrumbs and season with sage, pepper, 
and salt. Slit the leg of mutton at the sinews, pack in the 
stuffing, and roast, basting the leg frequently. 

MINCED MUTTON ON TOAST 

Chop fine the yolks of two or three hard-boiled eggs. To 
them add half a teaspoon of mixed mustard, a pinch of salt, 
and a dash of cayenne. When well stirred together, mix in 
a cup of cold cooked mutton well minced, and half a cup of 
cream. Set over the fire, and when hot spread upon toast 
of white bread cut in triangles, circles, squares, or fingers. 

Some cooks add to this dish a tablespoon or two of 
sherry. But the mince is good without the wine, and we do 
not encourage the use of such flavorimgs for simple, everyday 
cooking. 



MUTTON AND LAMB 115 

IRISH STEW 

When you buy your mutton for the stew have the butcher 
cut in between the joints, giving the effect of chops. It is 
useless for you to buy the loin — sl waste of money and not 
so good a piece because of its fat. It is the scrag or neck 
piece you want for Irish stew, for a small stew two pounds. 
Slice three or four onions in a hot iron pot and let them 
fry in their own juice till they are light brown. Don't bum 
them. Then add slowly a quart and a half of cold water 
and lay in the meat. Let the water slowly come to boil, and 
after it has boiled up and you have skimmed it, set it back 
upon the stove, where it will merely bubble and simmer — ^not 
boil. Let it stay for two hours, adding a teaspoon of salt, 
and keeping it tightly covered. 

Peel as many potatoes as you want to use. Slice two in 
thin slices for dissolving and thickening the gravy. The 
water will be pretty well boiled out, but don't mind that; 
you want only enough for a gravy, not enough for a broth. 
Cut the potatoes in two if they seem too large, and put them 
all, the sliced and halved, over the mutton^ Set the pot for- 
ward over a little brisker fire. Be sure to fit the cover tight 
on, to keep in steam and preserve the flavor. Allow three- 
quarters of an hour for the potatoes to cook, and serve the 
stew smoking hot upon a hot platter. 

SCOTCH HOTCHPOTCH 

Wash and siut in small pieces two pounds of the scrag or 
neck of mutton. Put it over the fire with three cups of 
water, bring it slowly to boil, and cook it slowly and gently 
for an hour and a half, keeping it covered tight. Then cut 
into dice a small carrot, two onions and a turnip, and add to 
the meat Add also half a can of fine marrowfat peas and 
a teaspoon of salt. Cook till all the vegetables are thoroughly 
tender, and twenty minutes before serving add the other half 
of the can of peas. If the liquid is fat after you take up the 
meat, skim it. The peas and vegetables will have thickened 



116 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the gravy, but you may need a dessertspoon of flour for 
thickening in addition. Serve on a platter, the mutton in the 
centre and the vegetables surrounding it. 

LAMB STEW 

Slice four good-sized onions thin, rinse in cold water, 
and cook in an iron frying-pan, with enough cold water to 
cover them. Slice the icold lamb in thin slices and pieces. 
When the onions are done put in the meat, season with salt 
and pepper, and add a half-teacup of stewed tomato and any 
cold gravy you may have left from the lamb. Have enough 
water to cover the meat. Stew slowly one hour. Thicken 
with flour dissolved and stirred smooth in cold water. Pour 
this into the middle of the stew, and stir with the back of 
the spoon to prevent lumping. Cover and keep hot

BACON AND EGGS 

HAVE a saucq>an well heated, and in it lay thin slices of 
bacon. Fry on both sides till crisp. Put on a hot platter, 
and into the hot fat remaining in the saucepan slip eggs, one 
at a time, from a saucer. Cook till slightly browned on one 
side, then turn and brown on the other side. Lay the eggs 
on the platter, put a slice or two of bacon on each tgg and 
serve at once. 

FRIED BACON 

Bacon is best cooked not in an iron frying-pan, but on 
tin or granite. Heat hot an omelet pan or a tin pie-plate. 
Cook rather slowly, turning the bacon from one side to the 
other, until a nice brown without being hard. Serve on a hot 
dish, and pour over it whatever quantity of the fat is wished. 

BOILED BACON WITH BOILED CABBAGE 

Choose a piece of bacon sufficient for the number re- 
quired. Put it in a pot and cover it with cold water. Skim 
when it comes to boil, and boil until tender, which will be 
one hour or one hour and a half. When done lay it on a 
platter and surround it with hot boiled cabbage. 

JOWL AND GREENS 

The jowl of the hog salted and cured is delicious and 
appetizing when cooked with young spring dandelion, beet, 



n 



118 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

or other fresh, tender greens. Wash the jowl and set it over 
a brisk fire in a kettle. There should be enough cold water 
to cover it. When the water comes to boil, skim and set the 
kettle where the water will gently bubble. Allow three td 
four hours for its cooking. 

The greens you cook with it should be thoroughly washed 
through several waters, and added in time to cock through 
and be perfectly done by the time the jowl is cooked. If 
you use cabbage as the vegetable, or turnips, or young dan- 
delions, or young beets, allow for their cooking an hour at 
least; two hours is better. For potatoes allow half or three- 
quarters of an hour. Cut the cabbage into quarters, and 
examine it closely for creeping things. 

PORK AND BEANS 

Soak a quart of white beans overnight. Next moi^ning 
drain off the water, cover with fresh water and bring to boil. 
Pour off this water, cover again with cold water, and add 
a square piece of pork weighing about half a pound. Score 
. the skin of the pork before putting it in with the beans. Boil 
slowly until the beans are growing soft, then stir in a heap- 
ing tablespoon of brown sugar or a half of a small cup of 
molasses. Put all in a dripping-pan, with the poric in the 
centre, and bake an hour or more, till the top of the beans 
has a brown crust 

See also "Baked Beans," Chapter XVII. 

TO CURE HAMS 

After fhey are thoroughly cold and free from animal heat, 
pack the hams in a barrel or cask, laying them skin-side 
down. Make carefully the following brine: Weigh out 
twenty pounds of coarse salt, two pounds of sugar or two 
quarts of New Orleans molasses, and half a pound of salt- 
petre. Measure fourteen gallons of water. Put all in the 
big kettle or wash-boiler you wish to make the brine in, set 
over the fire, and when the scum begins to rise begin to skim. 



PORK 119 

By the time the brine boils you will have it clear. When it 
has boiled a few minutes, set it off the fire to become cold. 
After the hams have lain in the brine from three to six 
weeks you will want to smoke them. If you have no smoke- 
house, improvise one by getting a barrel or, if a barrel is not 
large enough, a hogshead. Across its bottom nail poles, and 
on the poles string your hams, having tied a cord loop into 
each. Take an old iron pot half full of ashes and build a 
fire of green hickory chips or of corncobs in it. Don't have 
more than a double handful of fuel, for you must avoid heat. 
Smoke is what you want, not heat. To make the fire put 
live coals on the ashes, and then lay on the coals your cobs 
or chips. The fire must smoulder and smoke, not bum to 
make heat which would cook and spoil your hams. Set the 
pot of smudge on the ground, and over it the hogshead, up- 
side down, with the hams hanging from its bottom. If 
smoke leaks from the hogshead cover it with things you have 
at hand — ^papers, old carpets, etc. When the hams are suffi- 
ciently smoked, put each one in a paper sack or in cloth bags. 
To rub the fiesh side and the end of the leg with black, 
cayenne or red pepper before smoking is thought by some 
to be a preventive against the attack of insects and to save 
putting the hams in bags. 

TO BOIL A HAM 

First wash and scrape the ham and soak it all night in 
plenty of cold water. In the morning put it in a kettle and 
cover it with cold water. You may add if you wish a table- 
spoon of brown sugar, a sprig of thyme, and a few allspice, 
but many prefer the ham cooked in water to which no flavor 
has been added. When the water begins to boil, skim and 
set the kettle on the Back of the stove where the water will 
boil gently. In this way let it boil five or six hours, when the 
ham will be well cooked. Tip it from the kettle, or lift it 
out to an earthen jar or wooden bowl, and leave the ham in 
the liquor in which it was boiled, to get cold. Then take off 
the skin and cover with rasped breadcrumbs. 



120 THE HOME OOOK BOOK 

If you wish to add browning also to the ham — ^i 
some like — skin the ham while hot, place it in a drippmg'- 
pan, sprinkle over it sugar and breadcrumbs, and bake an hour. 

But if the ham is left to cool in its own liquor, it seems 
to have an e^)eciaUy fine and juicy flavor. 

HAM BOILED IN CIDER 

Wash a ham thoroughly clean. Soak overnight in clear, 
cold water. Next morning bring to boil a kettle of cider. 
Be sure you use a porcelain-lined kettle, so that the cider 
will not be affected by the metal. Do not poison the ham by 
using tin. In the boiling cider lay the freshened ham and 
boil it slowly from five to eight hours, according to the size 
and needs of the ham. Set to cool in the liquid in which it 
boils. If you wish a spice taste to the ham, while it is boil- 
ing tfirow in the cider a fittle cinnamon, mace, and cloves 
tied in a thin muslin bag. 

JAMBOLAYA 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Mince fine all pieces of ham you can get off a well-cut- 
from bone. Fry these with four slices of raw bacon cheeped 
very fine. Add one onion minced fine, and two or more cups 
of cold boiled rice. Add enough strained tomatoes to give 
liquid and keep the rice from burning. Stir constantly and 
season with thyme, salt, and one pepper pod chopped fine. 
If you have a few cold sausages, or cold chicken or turkey, 
chop fine and add. Fry until all seems quite dry, remove 
from the fire, add two eggs, beat in, and then turn the whole 
into a porcelain dish and baste over with a little butter. Set 
in the oven to form a crust over the top. 

HOG'S HEAD CHEESE ^ 

Have your butcher split the head and clean it Wash it 
thoroughly and put it into a kettle of boiling water, the 
water being enough to completely cover it. Cover the kettle 



PORK 121 

ti^t and boil gently till the meat separates freely from the 
bones. Take the head in a pan and pick out all the bones. 
Next put it in your chopping bowl and chop fine. While 
in the bowl season, to a pint of meat a tablespoon of salt, a 
tablespoon of finely powdered sage, and also a saltspoon of 
pepper. Mix thoroughly and moisten with the thick liquid 
left from the boiling head, half a cup to a pint of the meat. 
Taste to see if the seasoning is right. If not, add what you 
think is lacking. Set on the fire when you have completed 
the seasoning, cook slowly half an hour, pour into molds 
or bowls, and set to cool. A little melted lard poured over 
the top of the head cheese after it cools shuts out the air and 
helps to preserve it. Keep in a cold place. Serve the cheese 
cut in smooth slices. 

HOLLAND MEAT PIE 

Take one pound of raised bread dough and roll it to one- 
eighth of an inch thick and six inches wide, and just as long 
as possible without breaking the dough. Then lay along the 
centre a mixture made of two pounds of lean sausage meat 
highly seasoned with sage, thyme, and summer savory. Then 
bring the long edges of the dough over and pinch them to- 
gether, using water to make them adhere. Pinch the ends 
together also. Now brush with beaten egg and sprinkle 
with caraway seeds and coil on a greased pan. Bake until 
the dough is risen and richly browned. Garnish with fried 
parsley and serve either hot or cold. [See illustration, 
Plate XL] 

MOCK DUCK 

Split down its length a pork tenderloin. In the opening 

stuff a forcemeat such as you make for duck. Sew the 

op^ii^ together to inclose completely the stuffing, put in a 

dripfMng-pan, rub the meat with flour, salt, and pepper, add 

a cup of boiling water, and roast, frequently basting till the 

meat is thoroughly cooked. Draw out the thread and lay 

^ ^ 6 Vol. 2 



122 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

on a hot platter. Serve with it apples cooked till soft, and 
without sugar. 

CROWN ROAST OF PORK 

A dozen pork chops should be tied round in crown form 
for this dish. The ribs rising at the top should be trimmed 
free from meat and all be cut till of the same height. The 
centre of the crown fill with sausage meat well seasoned and 
lightened by one-third its quantity of breadcrumbs. Roast 
in a moderate oven till thoroughly done, allowing three full 
hours. Serve the meat with apples cooked without sugar, 
and also with plain boiled onions and mashed potato. 

ROAST PORK WITH SAGE 

Rub a loin roast with flour, salt, and generously sprinkle 
with pulverized sage. Put in a dripping-pan with a cup of 
hot water and set in the oven. Baste often with the little 
water and the fat from the meat and the sage on the bottom 
of the dripping-pan. Allow two and a half to three hours 
for a six-pound loin roast. When done put the meat on a 
hot platter, pour off much of the fat in the dripping-pan, set 
the pan on the stove, add a teacup of hot water, stir in a 
tablespoon of flour dissolved in cold water, and cook till 
thick. This gravy will be seasoned with the sage remaining 
in the dripping-pan. 

ROAST TENDERLOINS 

Split two tenderloins lengthwise, or direct your market 
man to do so when you purchase. Make a stuffing or force- 
meat of breadcrumbs, and season well with onions and 
sage and salt. Fill the tenderloins with the forcemeat, salt 
and pepper the outside of the meat. Set in a dripping-pan 
with a little hot water, and roast in a hot oven two or three 
hours — ^the time you must judge by the size of the loin. An 
added flavor is gained by fastening two or three slices of 
bacon with wooden toothpicks to the tenderloin. Eat hot 
or cold.

BROILED PORK TENDERLOINS 

Split pork tenderloins open lengthwise, and season highly 
with salt and pepper. If cooked on a gas stove (which is 
best), broil on a wire frame set in a shallow pan, under the 
flame. Cook slowly. Have a pie-pan with a tablespoon of 
butter dissolved in two or more tablespoons of hot water. 
Take out the tenderloins, and turn them over and over in 
the butter and water while cooking. Baste them in this way 
every five minutes to make them juicy. Cook thoroughly 
and a Kght brown, and avoid cooking them hard. Lay on 
hot dish and pour over melted butter seasoned with salt and 
pepper. If cooked with coal or wood stove, use the oven 
and follow same directions. 

FRIED SALT PORK WITH FRIED APPLES 

Pour boiling water over slices of salt pork. Have care 
that the rind is clean. Put the pork in a hot iron saucepan 
and fry both sides till it is crisp. Lay the slices on a hot 
platter. Have ready some qviick-cooking, tart apples, not 
peeled but washed, wiped, and sliced in thin slices straight 
across the apple. Slip these into the hot fat left from the 
fried pork, cover tight, stir occasionally, and cook the apples 
till they are tender. Lay in a circle round the pork and serve 
all hot. 

OLD-FASHIONED SALT PORK WITH MILK GRAVY 

Cut the pork in thin slices, put it in a frying-pan and 
cover with fresh cold water. When the water begins to 
steam pour it off. Set the pan back on the fire and fry the 
pork till crisp in its own fat. Take out the slices and lay 
on a hot platter. Pour off the grease in your drippings jar, 
keeping about a tablespoon in the pan. Put back the pan 
on the fire, and stir a couple of tablespoons of flour in the 
fat. Then pour in a cup of milk. The milk will cook and 
thicken with the flour. Stir well and pour on the platter 



124 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

with the pork. Serve this pork with unsweetened apple- 
sauce and mashed potatoes. 

TO FRY PORK SAUSAGES 

In a hot saucepan put a teaspoon of butter or drippings, 
and in the fat brown a chopped onion or two. When the 
onion is brown squeeze in the juice of half a lemon or of a 
whole lemon if you have several sausages. Then put in your 
sausages and cook through, keeping the saucepan covered. 
Lay the sausages on a hot platter, shake a tablespoon of 
browned flour in the saucepan, add two or three tablespoons 
of boiling water, boil up, and pour the gravy on the platter 
beside the sausages. 

SAUSAGE AND EGGS 

If you have a sausage or two left over, utilize them with 
scrambled eggs. Cut the sausage in small circles and heat 
in a saucepan. When heated through the sausage has left a 
little fat in the pan. Pour in three well-beaten eggs to which 
two tablespoons of milk or cream have been added. Stir 
the eggs till they cook thick and smooth. Season with salt 
while they :cook, and serve at once.

BAKED CHICKEN WITH OYSTER DRESSING 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

TO a tablespoon of boiling butter add one minced onion, a 
good pinch of rosemary, the same of thyme, and one small 
minced red pepper. When these are browned, add one cup 
of oyster- juice. Let all simmer five minutes, and then add 
two cups of boiled rice and one cup of minced lean of ham. 
Brown a little and then add two dozen chopped oysters. Stir 
until it all becomes quite brown^ remove from the saucepan, 
and stuff the fowL Under each pinion and between each 
thigh and the body lay a thin slice of bacon. Tie down the 
drunv-bone knuckles and fasten the wings, dust the bird with 
flour, amd lay some thin slices of bacon over the breast. Lay 
the bird in a roasting-pan, and use two teacups of tomato- 
juice amd one of oyster- juice to baste with. Add the giblets 
boiled tender and chopped to the gravy formed in the pan. 
Bake one bour, basting often. 

BROILED CHICKEN 

A chicken weighing about two pounds when dressed 
should be prepared for broiling by being split down the back. 



126 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Spread out the bird and lay it in a baking-pan in which you 
have poured half a cup of boiling water. Cover tight, set 
over the fire or in a brisk oven, and let the chicken cook in 
the steam till the meat is nearly done. If the hot water 
cooks away add a little more. Just before the chicken is 
wholly cooked put it on your gridiron or broiler and finish the 
cooking over a direct fire, buttering it a little as it broils. Lay 
the broiled chicken on a hot dish, spread upon it maitre 
d 'hotel sauce and serve. 

CREAMED CHICKEN 

Clean and cut up in neat pieces two chickens. Put them 
on to boil and before they are done pare some potatoes, cut 
them in two, lay them on top of the chicken and let them 
boil till done. Then take up the potatoes carefully on a plate 
by themselves. Pour a pint of cream upon the chicken, let 
it heat, then thicken with a scant tablespoon of flour dis- 
solved in a small half cup of milk. Season with salt, pepper, 
and fresh butter. If you have no cream milk will answer, 
but more butter will be required. 

CREAMED CHICKEN FOR COMPANY 

Take the meat of two chickens which have been roasted 
or boiled and cut into small pieces. Mix half a pint of milk 
with one pint of cream, heat in a double-boiler, and pour 
over three tablespoons of flour which have been stirred into 
a piece of butter the size of an egg. Add salt and cayenne to 
taste. Stir the cream until it thickens. Into an earthen 
baking dish put a layer of the cut chicken. Over this Sk 
layer of cream. Then a layer of chicken. Then cream. So 
do till the dish is full with a cream layer on top. Sprinkle 
with fine breadcrumbs and bake an hour in a moderate oven. 

If you use all milk, allow more butter. And if you use 
small individual dishes instead of a large baking dish allow 
less time for the baking, say twenty minutes. For conven- 
ience you may put together the cream and chicken in the 



POULTRY AND GAME 127 

morning, and not bake till the later hour of the day in which 
you want the dish; but in that event be sure to keep the 
chicken in a cool place so that the cream will not sour. 

CHICKEN WITH CREAM SAUCE 

For one chicken boiled and cut as for salad, make a 
sauce of one pint of rich milk, two tablespoons of flour, and 
one tablespoon of butter. Heat the milk in a double-boiler, 
and then add the flour and butter. Take half a can of mush- 
nxMns, cut them in pieces, and boil them gently five minutes 
in their own liquor. Add them to the hot milk sauce, boil 
three minutes, stir in the chicken, and serve either in a large 
dish or in small hot shells. 

CHICKEN CURRY 

Chop two large onions and put in a kettle with three- 
fourths of a cup of butter, and cook the onions till brown. 
Add a young, tender chicken of three or four pounds, the 
chicken having been cut in small pieces. Add also half a 
tablespoon of curry, three fresh tomatoes, or one cup of 
canned tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover tight 
and simmer an hour or longer. Then add a cup of milk and 
boil up once. About the rim of a platter bank fresh boiled 
rice, pour the hot curry in the middle so the walls of rice 
will hold it, and serve hot. 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN 

Separate all the joints of the chicken and wash in cold 
water. Then put in a granite kettle. Add two large onions 
cut in half, and two slices of salt pickled pork. Cover two 
inches above the chicken with cold water. When it begins 
to boil add pepper and salt, and season carefully and highly. 
Cook until very tender. Cut slices of stale bread into ob- 
long pieces two inches wide. Lay these on a hot platter. 
Take out the chicken and place it on the bread. Mix flour 
and water tc^ther smoothly, pour this into the gravy, taste, 



128 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and boil until it thickens. Then pour over the bread and 
chicken. It commonly takes about four heaping tablespoons 
of flour to thicken. 

FRIED CHICKEN 

Wash and cut the chicken, separating each joint Sprinkle 
the pieces with salt, pepper, and flour before you begin to 
fry. Have ready the frying-pan with hot lard. Fry the meat 
slowly until well cooked and a nice brown, being careful not 
to bum it When done, pour off nearly all the fat. Then add 
milk or milk and cream for a gravy. Mix about two table- 
spoons of flour smoothly in cold water, put into the milk, 
stirring constantly until it thickens. Pour the gtavy over 
the chicken. 

CHICKEN LOAF 

Boil a fowl till the meat is ready to fall from the bones. 
Salt while boiling. Take from its liquor, and while you are 
picking out the bones let the liquor boil down so that it 
measures not more than three cups. To this add quarter of 
a box of gelatine which you have already soaked and softened. 
Round the bottom of a mold or bowl lay two hard-boiled 
eg^s sliced in circles. Upon this put a layer of dark meat, 
then a layer of light meat, and so alternate till you have 
used up the chicken. Do not pack the meat tight, but leave 
space for the liquor to fill in. See that the seasoning is right, 
add pepper if wished, and then pour the liquor over the meat, 
seeing first that the gelatine is well dissolved. Set away to 
chill, and the liquor will harden to a jelly. Tip on a platter 
when served. 

A ni.ce dish for Sunday evening supper. 

CHICKEN AND MUSHROOMS 

In a saucepan melt two tablespoons of butter, and when 
hot add two tablespoons of minced onion and half a can of 
mushrooms chopped. Let cook for five minutes, and add a 
cup of milk into which a tablespoon and a half of flour has 



POULTRY AND GAME 129 

been stirred. Cook all together, and when thick and smooth 
add a cup of chicken meat cut into small pieces or dice. Heat 
through, season with, salt and pepper to taste, and serve all 
together in a hot dish, or on pieces of toast of a golden 
brown, or in shells of pastry of the individual patty-pan size. 

AUNT NANCY'S SMOTHERED CHICKEN 

Have tender chicken for this dish, and cut in pieces as 
for fricassee. Roll the chicken in flour in which is mixed 
salt and pepper needful for seasoning, and put in a skillet 
(saucepan) in which is a little cream. Cover close. Turn 
the chicken often and add cream or milk when necessary to 
keep from burning. Cook slowly one hour, and just before it 
is done add a little butter. 

PANNED BREAST OF CHICKEN 

Place the breast in a small baking dish with a little boil- 
ing water. Cook till brown, basting frequently. Season 
nicely and serve on a hot plate with a border of rice and 
olives. [See illustration, Plate XII.] 

CHICKEN PIE 

Take two fat young fowls, cut them in pieces, put in a 
pot, nearly cover with boiling water, and cook slowly. After 
they have cooked three-quarters of an hour add a pint of raw 
potatoes cut in slices, and cook ten minutes from the time 
they began again to simmer. Salt to taste. Have a deep pan 
lined with a biscuit crust, that is a dough made after baking 
powder biscuit receipt. The dough should be rolled thicker 
than the common fruit-pie crust. Lay cooked chicken in the 
pan, then put in a layer of potato, and so alternate till you 
have used your material. Thicken the water in which the 
chickens cooked by stirring in three or four tablespoons of 
flour dissolved in a little cold water and boiling up the liquor. 
Pour this over the chicken and potato in the deep pan, add a 
tablespoon or two of butter — ^more or less, according to the 



ISO THE HOME COOK BOOK 

.fatness of your chickens — two or three hard-boikd eggs, 
sliced, and taste again to see that salt and pepper are right 
Cover with a top crust, score the centre of Hie top so that 
steam may escape, pinch down the edges tight, and bake two 
hours in a moderate oven. 

Two ingredients not mentioned above may be included, 
if one's taste wishes. One is a cup of stale breadcrumbs 
with the gravy, and another is a cup of chopped boiled ham. 

CHICKEN POTPIE 

Singe, draw, wash, and cut up two fat fowls. Lay them 
in a pot with quarter of a pound of salt pork cut in slices, 
and cover with tepid water. Bring slowly to boil, and cook 
slowly till the meat is about to separate from the bone. No 
time can be set, because the flesh of the fowl may be tender 
or may be tough. It is best to allow two hours and a half 
or three hours. If your fowls are tough, then you have 
time to cook tender; if they are tender and the meat gets 
done before you are ready for it> hold up the cooking by 
setting the pot in a warm place. Twenty minutes before 
serving bring the chickens to a quick boil and drop from a 
tablespoon pieces of dumpling dough (described on page 82). 
Do not let the boiling stop, but keep it up for fifteen minutes 
or perhaps twenty minutes. Then lift your meat to a hot 
platter and lay on also the dumplings. Into the boiling 
gravy stir flour worked smooth in a little cold water. Season 
to taste, and when the flour thickens ladle some of the gravy 
over the meat and dumplings. Serve the rest of the gravy 
in a bowl. 

PLAIN POTTED CHICKEN 

Boil the chicken till tender and ready to fall from the 
bone, using as little water as possible and putting in seascoi- 
ing of salt and pepper while the chicken is cooking. Drain 
off the liquor or gravy and take out the meat. Separate rtie 
white meat from the dark and chop both separately and very 
fine. In the dish in which you wish to mokl the chicken lay 



POULTRY AND GAME 181 

the white meat, completing a layer on the bottom of the 
mold and pile the dark on top, or press the white meat to one 
side and the dark to the other side. Moisten the meat by 
pouring over it a little of the liquid in which it was cooked, 
lay a saucer, plate, or small board upon it, put on a weight 
and set away till the meat is cold and solid. 
Serve the chicken turned upon a platter. 

POTTED CHICKEN OR TURKEY 

Free the roast meat of a fowl from all bones. To every 
pound of meat add quarter of a pound of butter, pounding it 
in, and add little by little one teaspoon of mace, half a nut- 
meg, and cayenne pepper and salt to your taste. When you 
have worked all to a smooth paste, pack it in small glass or 
earthenware pots, and cover with clarified butter. Exclude 
all air by sealing the pots if you wish to keep the meat for 
any length of time, and set in a dry, airy place. 

A little boiled ham minced and oounded with the chicken 
gives added -flavor. 

PRESSED CHICKEN 

Cook a fowl in just water enough to keep it from burn- 
ing until the meat loosens from the bones. After it has 
cooled pick it to pieces and mix the light and dark meat. 
Boil till hard two eggs, slice thin and add to the picked-up 
chicken. Boil down the water in which the chicken was 
cooked till it fills a small teacup. Add a little butter, pepper 
and salt. Mix all with the picked-up chicken, put in a mold 
or bowl, put on a weight to press, and set in a cool place. 
When time to serve, tip the chicken on a platter. 

CHICKEN WITH RED PEPPERS 

This is a Spanish receipt. It is good for using up left-over 
chicken. Boil three large red peppers until tender. Take 
out and throw away the seeds in which lie the strength of 
the peppers, add an onion, and chop fine with the peppers. 



182 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Mix two teaspoons of flour with two of butter, thin with 
half a cup or a small cup of milk. Bring to boil together 
with the minced peppers and add a cup of chicken chopped 
fine. Serve hot. 

REMNANTS OF COLD CHICKEN 

Cut the meat in small pieces as if for a salad. Rub a 
tablespoon of flour in a tablespoon of butter, add a table- 
spoon of minced onion and the same amount of parsley or 
minced celery, and stir all into a cup and a half of new 
milk heated in a double-boiler. When the milk thickens salt 
and pepper to taste, and stir in the diced chicken and let it 
heat through. Have small pieces of toast, put the chicken 
on the bread and serve. 

CHICKEN WITH RICE AND SAFFRON 

AN ITALIAN DISH 

Boil a six-pound chicken with two minced onions, one 
minced red pepper, and two minced sweet peppers. Bcril 
until the [chicken is very tender. After removing the chicken 
add one pound of rice to the boiling broth. Boil for thirty 
minutes until the rice absorbs almost all the broth. Stir in 
one tablespoon of butter, one can of French mushrooms, and 
the minced cooked giblets. Add one heaping tablespoon of 
saffron powder, stirring through the rice. Pile the rice in 
a mound on a flat dish. Carve the chicken and lay in a bor- 
der about the rice. 

SPANISH CHICKEN 

Cut up as for fricassee a fowl, and put on to cook in hot 
water to cover it. Take a dozen dry red peppers, cut out 
the seed, and then cut up and boil twenty minutes or half 
an hour till tender. When cooked moisten them with a 
little of the chicken broth and put through a sieve. In a 
saucepan in which you have a large spoon of hot lard slice 
two good-'sized onions and let them fry. When brown add 



POULTRY AND GAME 138 

the peppers, and the chicken, which you have salted in its 
cooking and which must be thoroughly cooked and tender, 
and also add half a cup of the chicken broth. Thicken the 
rest of the broth, pour in the saucepan, and let the whole 
simmer over a gentle fire for fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Serve on a hot platter. 

STEWED CHICKEN WITH DUMPLING 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Cut the chicken for stewing, roll each piece in flour and 
brown in two tablespoons of <iK>t dripping in a deep sauce- 
pan or casserole. Add quarter of a pound of lean boiled ham 
which you have cut in small pieces, one large minced onion, 
one bay leaf, two minced bell peppers, one minced red pep- 
per, half a teaspoon of rosemary, half a teaspoon of thyme, 
and a clove of minced garlic. 

Fill the x^asserole with water and allow all to simmer 
about two hours, until the water has cooked down to a rich 
gravy. Make the dumplings by creaming one teaspoon of 
butter with two beaten eggs. Add one teacup of flour and 
one teaspoon of baking powder. Mix to a soft dough, as soft 
as may be to roll out on the board. Roll and cut the dough 
in cubes one inch in size. Drop these cubes in the boiling 
stew fifteen minutes before serving. They will rise to cubes 
two inches in size. 

CHICKEN TERRAPIN 

A WASHINGTON DISH FOR FESTIVAL DAYS 

Boil two fowls until they are so tender that the meat 
parts readily from the bone when you stick in a fork. When 
the meat is cold cut it in small dice or squares. Heat a pint 
of milk in a double-boiler and to it add half a pound of 
butter into which you have rubbed and beaten two table- 
spoons of flour. Stir the butter and milk till boiling hot, 
take from the fire, and stir in half a teaspoon of salt, a dash 
of cayeone, a dash of nutmeg, and the yolks of six eggs. 



134 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

which you have previously well beaten. Put the diced chicken 
meat in a saucepan, pour the mixture over it, heat, but do not 
boil, and just before serving stir in a pint of sherry. A dish 
to go well with this is creamed potatoes. 

TO BONE A TURKEY 

Have a tender turkey, singe, draw, wash, and wipe it dry. 
Lay it before you, and have a sharp, narrow-pointed knife. 
Scrape the flesh from the bone ; do not cut it. Begin by going 
round the neck and shoulders and wings, taking off all the 
flesh from the bone, and pushing it before the knife as you 
proceed. Work the knife slowly and gradually, and do not 
break the skin. When the flesh has been completely cut from 
the bone, pull the neck and draw the whole skeleton out, leaving 
the flesh, which will be shapeless. 

Fill out the bird to its own size by stuffing the legs and 
wings, and then the body, with the following forcemeat. 
Tie and truss it for cooking, and follow the directions given 
under "Roast Turkey" for the roasting. 

STUFFING FOR BONED TURKEY 

Chop to a mince five hard-boiled eggs. To them add five 
slices of a ham which you have minced, and the slices of a 
whole tongue. Put in a few pieces of salt pickled pork and 
finish out with breadcrumbs. For seasoning you will need 
butter, salt and cayenne. If your taste permits it, use onions, 
thyme, sweet marjoram, celery seed, sweet basil, parsley, or 
other seasoning. 

TURKEY LOAF 

Cold turkey may be made up with cold ham, as described 
under "Veal Loaf." 

ROAST TURKEY 

Choose a fat turkey, draw and singe it. Save the giblets, 
that is the heart, liver and gizzard. Wash and clean them. 



X

POULTRY AND GAME 185 



and set over to boil. While they are cooking make the force- 
meat, or stuffing. A common forcemeat for turkey is made 
of breadcrumbs, broken fine, well seasoned with salt and 
pepper, and, if your taste is pleased with it, also with sage. 
Butter should be added to give smoothness. When the gib- 
lets are tender — they may take some time to cook — ^take them 
from the saucepan, put them in a chopping bowl, and mince. 
Add them to the breadcrumbs, and add also the little liquor 
in which they have been cooked. When you have thoroughly 
mixed the ingredients named above you have a good turkey 
stuffing or forcemeat. 

Now take your turkey, which has been washed in a little 
clear water and wiped dry, and fill the hole at the neck where 
the crop came out, and also the whole body of the turkey. 
Sew up the slits, using a large needle made for such pur- 
poses, or a large darning needle. Wind a clean white cord 
about the body to hold it in shape, and push up the legs 
close and high against the body. Press the neck gently 
down into and under the back. Rub the turkey over with 
butter, dredge it with salt and flour, set it in a dripping-pan, 
pour into the pan a pint of boiling water, and push it in a 
hot oven. With the liquor in the pan baste the turkey every 
fifteen minutes. Let it cook two hours and a half to three 
hours. The heat of the oven should be greater the first hour 
of the cooking. 

When the bird is cooked set it on a hot platter, and 
with the liquor which remains in the pan, seasoned as it is 
by the stuffing that has oozed out during the cooking and the 
juices of the meat, make a gravy by thickening with flour. 
Put the gravy in a separate dish. 

If the water cooks out of the pan during the roasting, 
add more water, always boiling hot. 

A turkey may be stuffed with forcemeats given on page 
137. Oysters stuff turkeys admirably. They should be well 
seasoned before being put in. Again, chestnuts boiled, peeled 
and mashed with butter make a good stuffing. In the South 
boiled sweet potatoes mashed with butter have been used. 



136 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

But the best all-round forcemeat is that of breadcrumbs 
seasoned and mixed with minced giblets. 

It is an old-fashioned country notion that a turkey gains 
in sweetness by being frosted after it is ready for stufiingp and 
in New England and the North generally it used to be the 
custom to prepare the bird the day before it was to be eaten 
— ^at Thanksgiving and Christmas — ^and hang it outdoors to 
be stiffened by the freezing air. 

TURKEY DRESSING 

A nine-pound turkey will require nearly two baker's loaves 
of bread for dressing. Cut off the crust from the four sides 
of the loaf. Crumble it coarse. Season with salt and pepper, 
being careful of the salt, as there is salt in the bread. Season 
high. Add one large beaten egg, and one heaping tablespoon 
of melted butter. Mix lightly with the hands. Add thyme 
for further seasoning. Thyme that comes in packages is bet- 
ter than that prepared in bottles. After the turkey is drawn, 
and the lights taken out and wiped dry, put in the dressing 
lightly by the handful without squeezing the bread. The open- 
ing should then be covered with pieces of the crust from the 
bread to keep the dressing dry. Fasten the opening together 
witfc skewers which come for thus purpose or sew it up. When 
the turkey is served take away the pieces of bread, and 
the dressing will be light and moist. No water should 
ever be used in this dressing. Water makes it soggy. All 
the moistening required will be found in the egg and melted 
butter. Turkey gravy should be thickened with browned flour, 
mixed in cold water: for a pint of gravy two heaping table- 
spoons of lightly browned flour mixed with water and made 
rather thick and smooth. Boil until the gravy thickens, and 
no more. Strain through a tin strainer or a tin skimmer. 

DUCK, PORK, AND OTHER DRESSINGS 

See under receipt headed "Turkey Dressing" about an ex- 
cellent receipt for dressings of all kinds. To dude dressing 



POULTRY AND GAME 137 

made after this direction add a slice of chopped pickled pork 
and chopped onion and sage or thyme. To pork dressing, 
add sage and onions. 

CHESTNUT STUFFING FOR TURKEY 

Shell two or more quarts of large chestnuts — ^those called 
French chestnuts. The quantity must accord with the size 
of your turkey. Drop them in boiling water and let them cook 
till the skins are loosened. Rub off the brown skins, drop 
into boiling salted water and cook till tender. Take from the 
water and rub at once through a colander. With the mashed 
nuts mix a handful or two of fine breadcrumbs, moisten to 
a paste with cream and melted butter, season with salt and pep- 
per and pack in your turkey. The forcemeat will swell, and 
therefore do not pack it in too tight. 

SAUSAGE STUFFING FOR TURKEY 

Crumble the bread with which you wish to stuff your turkey, 
moistening it with a little cold water. Add and mix in three- 
quarters of a pound of home-made or country-made sausage, 
a couple of tablespoons of melted butter, the juice of an onion, 
or the onion itself finely :chopped, and three tart apples chopped 
fine. The sausage will have sage, but if you wish add a little 
more. Stir all together thoroughly, and force into the turkey. 

ROAST DUCK 

Singe, draw, and proceed as for "Roast Goose." 
Orange marmalade is a proper accompaniment for roast 
domestic duck. Serve with duck a rich brown sauce, into 
which, at the last moment, a tablespoon of orange marmalade 
has been stirred. 

ROAST GOOSE WITH APPLES 

A bread dressing seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, onions 
and sage can be used^ or mashed potatoes seasoned with but- 
ter, salt, pepper and fried onions is favorably recommended. 



188 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Dredge the skin of the bird with flour and baste frequently. 
When serving, garnish with sliced apples stewed in salted water 
and pickled walnuts, olives, or preserved oranges. [See 
illustration, Plate XII.] 

BROILED PARTRIDGE 

Singe and clean the birds and wipe dry with a cloth. Split 
up the back and press the breast bone flat. Rub the broiler 
with drippings and lay on the birds. Dip them in a sauce of 
melted butter several times while they are broiling. Allow 
twenty minutes for their broiling. Serve on a hot platter, 
laying maitre d'hdtel sauce upon each bird. 

BROILED QUAIL 

Dress and rinse the quail in cold water, and wipe dry. 
Open them down the back. Lay them on a wire frame, set 
in a shallow pan, with the breast turned down. Cook on a gas 
stove, under the flame, and cook slowly. Dissolve two or three 
tablespoons of butter, with half a teacup of hot water, in a 
tin pie plate. While the quail are cooking turn them in this 
melted butter every five minutes, in order to baste and make 
them juicy. When cooked through, turn the birds over, and 
brown the breast a nice brown. Serve on a hot platter, and 
pour melted butter, seasoned with salt and pepper, over them. 
If served on toast, sprinkle a very small pinch of salt over the 
toast, and pour a little melted butter over it before laying the 
quail on it. If the quail are cooked on a stove, lay them on a 
wire broiler over the coals, with the breast turned up. Baste, 
and cook in the same way. 

BROILED PIGEONS 

Cut out the breasts of the pigeons, dip them in melted but- 
ter, then dip in breadcrumbs, and broil on a broiler over a 
clear fire. When done sprinkle with salt and pepper, and lay 
on pieces of brown toast. Serve with watercress. 



POULTRY AND GAME 139 

ENGLISH PIGEON PIE 

Qean four pigeons, then split in two down the back. Cut 
one pound of tenderloin pork into small cubes, arrange in a 
baking-dish with layers of onions, tomato catsup, parsley, pep- 
per and salt, a sprinkling of flour. Lay the pigeons on this 
so that the feet of two will protrude from the centre of the 
crust, dusting the birds with salt, pepper, and flour. Pour 
over half a pint of beef stock ; put a puff-paste cover on ; brush 
with beaten tgg and bake about an hour and a half. This can 
be served either hot or cold. The legs of the birds must be 
scrubbed perfectly clean and the nails cut off close to the flesh. 
[See illustration, Plate XIII.] 

ROAST SNIPE 

After drawing and cleaning the birds, fill each one with a 
piece of well-buttered bread, seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Fasten a small piece of salt pork around each bird, catching 
it together with the bill. Place the birds on an earthen or en- 
ameled dripping-pan and very nearly cover with California 
port wine. To this add a tablespoon of butter. Baste every 
ten minutes, and bake half an hour in a steady oven. 

GAME PIE 

Stew one pound of venison cut in small pieces, one prairie 
chicken, one quail and two partridges until tender. Remove 
the meat from the bones, cutting in small pieces. Place these 
in browned butter and saute until browned on all sides, dredg- 
ing with flour. Strain the liquor and let stand in a cold place 
so the grease will rise and cake. Then remove it and return 
the liquor to a stewpan, add the meats, one tablespoon each 
of minced parsley and grated onion, twelve peppercorns, a 
quarter of a teaspoon of paprika and one teaspoon of salt. 
Stew until thick, then add one tablespoon of browned butter. 
Turn this mixture into a deep short-crust-Hned dish, which has 
been previously baked, and set away until cold. The game 
mixture will be found jellied. Garnish with either watercress

or parsley, and pickled walnuts are to be placed ovei" the top. 
To be served cold. [See illustration, Plate XIII.] 

JUGGED HARE 

Clean, skin and cut up one rabbit or hare into small pieces. 
Fry or saut£. Brown in butter with one sliced onion. Then put 
into a wide-mouthed jar with one glass of port wine, twelve 
slices of bacon browned, a pinch of cinnamon, six cloves, one 
bay leaf, minced parsley and celery, and the juice of one 
lemon. Cover tightly and set in moderate oven for four 
hours. Half an hour before removing place forcemeat balls 
in jar and finish cooking. [See illustration, Plate XIV.] 

VENISON WITH GOOSEBERRY JELLY 

Put one venison steak through a mincer. Add the yolks of 
three eggs, salt, pepper and dry mustard to taste. Form into 
balls. Roll in flour and saute in hot butter. Heap on a hot 
dish and surround with gooseberry jelly. [See illustration,

APPLE SAUCE 

EE directions for making apple sauce under "The Boon 
of an Apple Barrel," page 345. 

ASPARAGUS SAUCE 



Cut asparagus tips into cubes, boil till tender in salted 
water, and add to white sauce in the proportion of one cup of 
the asparagus cubes to one cup of white sauce. Eaten with 
fish and fowl. 

BEEFSTEAK SAUCE 

A JEWISH RECEIPT 

In a hot saucepan put a piece of fat the size of an egg, and 
three sliced onions. Brown all together. Put half a cup of 
beef stock to the onions, thicken with a tablespoon of flour, 
add a tablespoon of mustard, a teaspoon of vinegar and a dash 
of cayenne, :cook till the gravy thickens and serve with 
the steak. 

BREAD SAUCE 

Cook together in a double-boiler half a cup of fine white 
breadcrumbs, a small onion and a pint of milk. When smooth 
add a tablespoon of butter, half a teaspoon of salt, and a dash 
of white pepper. 



A42 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BROWN SAUCE 

Together in a saucepan stir two tablespoons of butter and 
two tablespoons of flour until dark brown. Then add a pint 
of hot water, or a pint of brown stock, if you have it. Boil 
till thick and smooth. If the browning of the flour has made 
it lose its strength for thickening, add a tablespoon of 
unbrowned flour to give the right thickness. Season to your 
taste with salt and black pepper, and add lemon-juice, catsup, 
or currant jelly, according to the flavor you wish. 

DRAWN BUTTER 

Mash together two large heaping tablespoons of butter 
and two heaping tablespoons of flour in a saucepan. When 
mixed, pour over and stir in half a pint of hot water. Dissolve 
and add salt to taste. Set this saucepan in another of hot water. 
Set over the fire and boil the water in the under saucepan 
very slowly, never fast at any time. Stir constantly to prevent 
lumping. The sauce must be perfectly smooth. Every now 
and then raise the upper pot from the water and stir hard. 
If more water is needed, add it. When the sauce is a creamy 
thickness to pour easily, take the saucepans from the fire and 
let them stand to keep the sauce warm until ready for use. 
Keep covered so no scum will form. Serve in a pitcher or 
gravy tureen. 

DRAWN BUTTER FOR FISH 

This sauce is made like "Egg Sauce" on page 144, leaving 
out the eggs. 

CAPER SAUCE 

Add one large spoon of capers to the "Drawn Butter" given 
above. 

CAULIFLOWER SAUCE 

Break in small pieces the tiny flowers of boiled cauli- 
flower and add a cup of the broken cauliflower to a cup of 

white sauce. 



SAUCBS FOR FISH AND MEAT 148 

CELERY SAUCE 

Cut celery in small cubes, boil in salted water till tender, 
and add to white sauce, one cup of the cooked celery to one 
cup of white sauce. This is used for fowl, fish, and meat. 

CHEESE SAUCE 

Mix together a tablespoon of butter, a tablespoon of corn- 
starch, a large half cup of milk, and set to heat over a 
moderate fire, or in a double-boiler. When thoroughly hot, stir 
in half a pound of grated American cheese, quarter of a 
teaspoon of mustard, and quarter of a teaspoon of salt. When 
the cheese melts, stir in an egg well beaten, and serve at once. 
This sauce is eaten with boiled fish. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

Put a quart of cranberries in a porcelain kettle after you 
have looked them over and washed them. Add a cup of 
water and cook till the berries are soft. Put in a jelly bag 
to strain. Squeeze the bag to get out all the juice, add three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, boil ten minutes, and pour in 
the dish from which it is to be served, or in an earthen mold. 
Set away to chill and stiffen. See also under "Stewed Cran- 
berries," page 350. 

CUCURIBER SAUCE 

Peel and cut in cubes two medium-sized cucumbers. Set 
in a colander and while they are draining stir into six table- 
spoons of whipped cream a dash of cayenne, half a teaspoon 
of salt, six or eight drops of onion- juice and as much vinegar. 
Mix this sauce with the cucumbers and serve cold with fish 
or meat. 

AN EASY CURRY 

Slice six onions in a pint or more of whatever stock you 
have. Slice in also a sour apple and half a clove of garlic. 
Wet a teaspoon of curry powder with water and stir this in 



144 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the stock, adding salt and cayenne to taste. Cut any kind 
of cooked meat into small cubes or pieces, and simmer it till 
hot in the sauce. Serve in hot dish and on hot plates. 

A dish of rice may be served with this curry, or rice may 
be banked about a platter's edge and the curry of meat poured 
in the centre. 

EGG SAUCE 

To make egg sauce, have the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs crumble into small pieces, and add to the "Drawn But- 
ter" given on page 142. 

EGG SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH 

Boil two eggs from eight to twelve minutes. Then lay 
them in a pan of cold water. When they are cold peel off the 
shells and chop the eggs quite fine. Beat two heaping table- 
spoons of butter into one tablespoon of flour and one teaspoon 
of salt. When the butter and flour are well mixed pour over 
them a coffee-cup of boiling water. Cook the sauce two or 
three minutes till the flour thickens, stir in: the chopped eggs 
and serve. Pepper may be dusted over the sauce when it is 
ready to serve. 

HORSERADISH SAUCE 

Wash clean roots of horseradish and scrape off the outside. 
Grate the roots on a large grater. Put the grated horseradish 
in a china or glass — ^not a metal— dish and moisten with good 
cider vin^ar. Do not add enough vinegar to make it liquid. 

This sauce is most excellent with plain boiled beef. 

HOT HORSERADISH SAUCE 

In an earthen dish put four tablespoons of fresh grated 
horseradish and four tablespoons of finely powdered cracker 
or bread crumbs. Add half a cup of cream, a teaspoon each 
of sugar and of salt, two dashes of pepper, two teaspoons of 
vinegar and a teaspoon of made mustard. Set over a kettle 



SAUCES FOR FISH AND MEAT 146 

of boiling water when you have stirred all together. Heat 
and serve hot with plain boiled beef or corned beef. 

JELLY SAUCE 

Another receipt follows the "Brown Sauce," given on page 
142. When you have made a brown sauce stir in a third of 
a cup of currant jelly. 

JELLY SAUCE FOR MEATS 

In an earthen or porcelain saucepan melt over a slow 
fire a tumbler of some jelly — either currant or grape — ^and 
when it is melted and warm stir in a tablespoon of butter. Let 
all come to boil, pour into the hot dish in which it is to be 
served, add a tablespoon of claret or other red wine and serve 
at once. The sauce goes well with mutton and lamb. 

MAITRE D'HOTEL SAUCE 

Beat three tablespoons of butter till it .creams. Add the 
juice of a small lemon, quarter of a teaspoon of salt, a dash 
of cayenne, and three teaspoons of minced parsley. 

This sauce is an agreeable addition to broiled chicken, fish, 
etc., and is referred to under various receipts. 

MINT SAUCE 

This IS a relish with roast lamb— with which meat alone it 
IS eaten. By some tastes it is much liked. Not every one 
agrees with the Englishman who, when mint sauce was 
passed him, said, "Thank you, I never eat smells.^ 

Be sure your mint is fresh and green and fair. Wash it, 
strip the leaves from the stems and mince them fine. Put the 
mince in a bowl and mix with it gradually clear cider vinegar 
not too strong. If the vinegar is very strong, it is better to 
dilute it, even to using half water, for sharp vinegar destroys 
tile mint aroma. Add also a teaspoon of sugar to a tablespoon 
of the minced mint. Have your sauce about as thick as horse- 
radish when all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed in. 

7 Vol. 2 



146 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Serve from a small dish with a teaspoon or ladle. A spoon 
of this sauce is laid on the rim of the plate and a pinch of 
it taken with the meat. 

OLIVE SAUCE 

Add to ''Brown Sauce/' on page 142, three-quarters of a 
cup of pickled olives, stoned and chopped. 

ONION SAUCE 

First peel and then chop fine a quart of onions. Melt in a 
saucepan a heaping tablespoon of butter and into the hot but- 
ter drop the minced onions and gently cook till tender. Season 
with white pepper and salt, and stir in two tablespoons of 
flour. Last, add a cup of cream, bring to boil and put 
through a sieve. 

This same sauce may be served with cold mutton, and as 
a delicious relish for many other meats. 

SAGE-AND-ONION SAUCE 

Take a bunch of fresh sage leaves picked from the stems. 
Wash and put in boiling water with just enough water to 
cover them. Boil ten minutes. Then drain and chop small. 
Meanwhile, have boiling in another pan two good-sized onions. 
When they are tender mince them and mix with the minced 
sage. Stir together with a tablespoon of fresh butter and 
serve with roast goose, roast duck, or roast pork. Into the 
sauce may be stirred some of the gravy of the meat with which 
it is served. This moistens the sauce and improves it. 

ONION-JUICE FOR SEASONING 

Peel, cut the onion in small pieces, and press in a lenum 
squeezer which you use for no other purpose but squeezing 
onions. Only a few drops of onion- juice are needed at a time 
in salads, meat sauces, etc., and with a little glass squeezer at 
hand it is readily obtained. If the pieces of the onion squeeze 
out, tie the onion in a piece of damp cheesecloth. 



SAUCES FOR FISH AND MEAT 147 

Or if you have not a squeezer, use this method of expressing 
the juice : Take the dry layers oif the onions, hack the juicy 
layeft with a dull silver knife. Press the onion hard with the 
blade, and the juice will drip from the blade. 

Or this method : Hold a tin grater over your salad, and on 
it turn about an onion you have peeled. Press hard and the 
juice will drip, 

SAUCE TARTARE 

After you have made a mayonnaise, add a tablespoon of 
chopped cucumber pickle, a few capers, a few chopped olives, 
stir or beat^ and if too thick thin with vinegar. 

TOMATO SAUCE 

Take a pint of canned tomatoes, add an onion well scraped 
or minced, half a teaspoon of salt and half as much pepper as 
salt, and put together in a saucepan over the fire. After cook- 
ing gently fifteen or twenty minutes, add two tablespoons of 
butter into which you have cooked a heaping tablespoon of 
flour until it has become smooth. Add the butter to the toma- 
toes slowly, let it cook gently for a few minutes, rub through 
a sieve or fine colander and serve hot. 

WHITE SAUCE 

To a tablespoon of melted butter b^t a tablespoon of flour, 
half a teaspoon of salt and an eighth of a teaspoon of white 
pepper. A quarter of a teaspoon of onion- juice, or half a 
teaspoon of chopped onion, may also be added, but is not an 
essential. Over all well mixed pour a cup of creamy milk, 
or stock, adding it little by little over a hot fire, as the sauce 
thickens. The sauce should be smooth. If it is not, strain it.

SALAD MATERIALS 

THE salad maker has a wide range of materials from 
which to compound her appetizing and wholesome dish. 
Its possibilities include not only nearly all vegetables and fruits, 
but also flesh, fish, fowl, and nuts in great variety. 

For the hot days the limit should extend no further than 
the succulent vegetables and fruits. The other foods are too 
rich in heat-producing properties for this purpose. If one 
keeps comfortably cool during warm weather the diet must 
be cut down, at least that part of it which contributes to the 
animal heat of the body. 

Nothing of questionable quality should enter into the com- 
position of a salad. The vegetables or fruit, as the case may 
be, should not only be fresh and without the slightest blemish 
to mar the flavor and looks, but crisp, cold, and refreshing. 

When uncooked vegetables are used, after being thoroughly 
cleansed with very cold water, they should be dried in a soft 
towel without crushing and kept in a cold place until needed. 

For the dressing, genuine olive oil should be used ; and the 
vinegar must be pure, that made from tarragon herbs being 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 149 

best for the purpose, furnishing, in addition to the acid neces- 
sary for the emulsificaticm and assimilation of the oil, an agree- 
able flavor to the dressing. 

A summer salad should never be dressed with any more 
elaborate preparation than a mixture of oil and vinegar or 
lemon-juice, seasoned with salt and pepper — ^ very simple 
compound; yet, according to the Spanish proverb, requiring 
four persons to make it : a spendthrift to bring the oil, a 
miser the vinegar, a man of judgment the seasoning, and a 
madman to do the stirring when mixed with the salad. Very 
good proportions for this dressing — French dressing, it is 
called — are: Four tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of 
vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt, and one-eighth of a teaspoon 
of white pepper. 

To blend these ingredients properly, that all may be incor- 
porated, yet no peculiar flavor predominate, mix the salt and 
pepper ; add one tablespoon of oil ; mix well ; add half a table- 
spoon of vinegar; blend. Then add the remainder of the oil, 
a few drops at a time, alternately with the vinegar. Variety 
may be furnished by the addition of a little lemon-juice or a 
few drops of the essence of anchovy. If onion flavor is liked, 
rub the salad bowl while empty with a garlic clove or a bit of 
onion. Use only a wooden spoon for salad dressings. 

To those who prefer tickling the palate to catering to the 
digestive apparatus of the inner man, this French dressing does 
not appeal, something more elaborate being demanded. In such 
homes the housewife will do well to become familiar with the 
following formula, for two reasons — it is a really good dress- 
ing; then, too, it will keep indefinitely in a cool place. 

AMERICAN BEAUTY SALAD 

Soak one ounce of gelatine half an hour in enough cold 
water to cover it. Bring to boil one slice of onion, a bay 
leaf, and half a teaspoon of celery seed in one pint of cold 
water. Add half a cup of rich stock, two tablespoons of 
lemon-juice, season with salt and pepper, add gelatine, and 
strain. Half fill individual molds with cold cooked beet, 



150 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

■ 

turnip, and potato cubes. Fill up with the jelly colored red 
with vegetable coloring. Garnish with green and serve with 
mayonnaise. 

ASPARAGUS SALAD 

Boil asparagus till tender, or use canned asparagus, some 
of which is excellent. Cut off all the hard and inedible portion, 
lay the asparagus in a salad bowl, having the tips all one way ; 
pour over a French dressing, and serve thoroughly cold, put- 
ting each individual portion on a lettuce leaf if you have the 
lettuce at hand. 

BANANA SALAD 

Red bananas are preferable to the yellow for all uses, and 
especially for this salad. Peel and cut the fruit in small 
pieces and, if you have it, add pineapple cut in small pieces, 
and also strawberries. Squeeze out and mix the juice of two 
oranges and one lemon, add sugar to taste — ^not enough to 
make it sweet — ^and pour over the cut bananas and other 

« 

fruit. Chill and serve cold. The fruit juice is daintier if 
flavored with a tablespoon of wine and a teaspoon of brandy, 
but the everyday use of such flavorings we do not recom- 
mend. 

BAKED BEAN SALAD 

Take two cups of baked beans and put over them a mixture 
made of one tablespoon of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, 
one tablespoon of oil, two tablespoons of minced onion and one 
tablespoon of chopped celery. 

STRING-BEAN SALAD 

String and break young beans and their pods into half-inch 
lengths. Cook tender in salted water. Drain, add a little 
chopped onion, pile in lettuce cups, dress with French dressing, 
and garnish* with tiny beet cubes. [See illustration, Plate XV.] 

NEW BEET SALAD 
The new beets must be thoroughly boiled — ^nothing is worse 
in the waf' of food than a half-cooked beet. When done cut 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 151 

them while hot in ratther thin slices and marinate them — that 
is, let them lie for an hour or two in a mixture of two table- 
spoons oil, one spoon vinegar, and a small pinch of salt. More 
than this must be used if there is to be a large dish of salad. 
When ready for serving put them in the salad dish with some 
very young and tender leaves of uncooked dandelion. Dress 
with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper of the French dressing. 

CABBAGE SALAD 

Chop white cabbage fine and mix it with a thin mayonnaise 
dressing. Set it where it will keep cool, and serve on a lettuce 
leaf with or without chopped nuts. Pass cheese wafers with 
this salad. 

COLD SLAW 

Select a firm white head of cabbage. Cut out the icore, 
chop it even and quite fine. In chopping take out the hard 
pieces. This slaw should always be chopped, not shaved. 
For the dressing break two eggs into a small saucepan. Put 
into them one heaping teaspoon of salt, one heaping teaspoon 
of sugar, not quite half an even teaspoon of mustard and two 
dashes of black pepper. Stir this together and beat the egg a 
little. In order not to cook the egg, add gradually (stirring 
all the time) a little less than half a teacup of vinegar. If the 
vinegar is sharp, weaken it by pouring in a little water. Stir 
all together. Set the saucepan into another containing warm, 
water. Let the water gradually come to boil. Stir constantly 
with a tablespoon, to prevent the eggs curdling. Cook until it 
is quite thick. This done, take it from the water. Add one 
dash of cayenne pepper if you like it, and one scant tablespoon 
of olive oil, one teaspoon of butter, and one tablespoon and a 
half of rich milk or jcream. Stir all together. Pour this dress- 
ing over two full teacups of chopped cabbage, and mix. 

Celery is a very nice addition, for variety. Take about four 
stalks of nice white celery, scrape, wash in cold water, and dry 
it. Slice in thin slices, and mix with the cabbage. This dish 
is better if it stands a few hours before serving. 



162 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

CREAM COLD SLAW 

Soak in cold water, to ensure its crispness, a head of cab- 
bage, shave in small strips, and pour over, mixing in well, a 
dressing made in the following way. Beat together two eggs, 
a tablespoon of mustard and two tablespoons of sugar. Add 
a tablespoon of butter, two tablespoons of vinegar, salt and 
pepper to taste, and four tablespoons of sour cream at the last. 
Stir vigorously, and when you pour over the cabbage mix it 
in well. 

HOT SLAW 

Select a hard white head of cabbage. Cut it in half. Shave 
it off with a slaw-cutter or a sharp knife in very trim strips. 
Make the dressing as follows: In a small saucepan put one 
egg, into which beat one even teaspoon of salt, one even tea- 
spoon of sugar, one-quarter (scant) of a teaspoon of mustard 
and one dash of red .pepper to taste. Mix together and beat 
a little. Set the saucepan in another in which there is warm 
water. Let it :come gradually to boil. Stir constantly to prevent 
lumping. When it thickens a very little take it off and add 
one tablespoon of cream. Pour it over the slaw hot. This 
may be eaten cold as well as hot. 

CARROT SALAD 

Cook richly colored carrots in boiling water till soft. Cut 
into thin strips. Arrange in lettuce cups, sprinkle with sifted 
sugar, dress with French dressing, and garnish with sliced 
lemon. [See illustration, Plate XV.] 

CAULIFLOWER SALAD 

Cold boikd cauliflower may be made into a delicious salad. 
Break the head into small pieces, keeping the flower-like look 
as much as possible, and serve with a French dressing or a 
mayonnaise. If you have lettuce leaves, serve the cauliflower 

on them. 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 153 

CELERY SALAD 

In keeping celery overnight, do not wrap it in wet paper 
or set it in a bowl of water. Put it where the air is pure and 
cool. To prepare it for serving, break oflf the stalks from the 
root, wash each one clean in cold water, scrape off the yellow 
brown where the stalk is abraded, lay in a dish with pieces 
of ice, and keep cold till served. The root of the celery should 
be preserved for soups, for which it is most desirable. 

CELERY AND HICKORY-NUT SALAD 

Cut in small dice the white stem of the celery. Add a 
few broken meats of the hickory-nut, and serve with a French 
dressing. 

CELERY, APPLE, AND HICKORY-NUT SALAD 

Use tart apples, and equal quantities of the apples, celery, 
and hickory-nut meats. Serve with a mayonnaise or French 
dressing. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

Split two chickens down the back. Wash them thor- 
oughly in cold water, wipe dry. Put them in a granite pre- 
serving kettle, cover with boiling water slightly salted. Boil 
until very tender. Cut or pull the chicken from the bones. 
Cut off all gristle and take away the skin. Chop the meat 
very coarse and even. Add to the chicken white cabbage 
chopped very fine, finer than for slaw, and in the proportion 
of one-third of cabbage. Take one bunch or one bunch and 
a half of white celery. Scrape, wash, and lay in !c;old water 
a short time. For the dressing, break six eggs into a sauce- 
pan. Mix three heaping teaspoons of salt, three heaping 
teaspoons of sugar, four dashes of black pepper, and one 
even teaspoon of mustard dissolved in cold water and stirred 
smooth. Stir these together and add to the egg, heating a 
little. Pour very gradually over the egg one teacup and 
one-quarter of vinegar, stirring constantly to prevent the 



154 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

egg from cooking. H the vinegar is sharp, weaken it with 
a little water. Now set the saucepan in another containing 
water. Let the mixture gradually come to boil. Stir con- 
stantly to prevent the egg curdling, and lift often from the 
water and stir hard to prevent it so doing. Let the mixture 
be very smooth. When quite thick take the saucepan from 
the water. Add one tablespoon and a half of butter to the 
thickened dressing, three tablespoons of very rich cream and 
two dashes of red pepper. Cut the celery into pieces one- 
quarter of an inch thick. Wipe the celery dry before slicing 
it. Mix it through the chicken. Pour the dressing over the 
chicken, and make it moist and creamy. If it stands some 
time it will absorb the dressing and be a little dry. Keep 
any dressing left to add, if needed. After the salad is mixed 
with the dressing, add three tablespoons of olive oil. Stir 
again and taste; if more red pepper, cream, or oil is needed, 
add it. Let stand a few hours before sendng. 

THE JUDGE'S CHICKEN SALAD 

Free from skin and fat the meat of two large boiled 
chickens. Cut the meat in cubes or dice and mix with it the 
same quantity of crisp celery cut in similar pieces. Add 
five minced olives and three teaspoons of capers. Make a 
dressing of six tablespoons of oil, two tablespoons of vine- 
gar, two teaspoons of salt, and a dash of cayenne. Mix the 
dressing with the chicken and celery and set in tfie refrige* 
rator several hours to chill. 

Prepare the mayonnaise given below, make a smootfi 
pile of the chicken in a salad bowl, pour the mayonnaise over 
and serve at once. 

MAYONNAISE FOR CHICKEN SALAD 

To the yolks of two eggs add drop by drop a pint of 
olive oil, stirring with a silver fork one way all the time. 
When the dressing thickens, thin with lemon-juice, keeping 
it all the time about as thick as thick cream. Add salt and 
pepper to taste. 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 155 

TO PREPARE CUCUMBERS 

Select only meditim-sized and well-shaped cucumbers. Half 
an hour before they are required, peel and slice them evenly, 
and not too thin. Lay in a tin pan, cover with cold water, add 
no salty as it wilt!s the cucumber, and put a large piece of ice 




A Cucumber Slicer 

into the water. Set the pan on the ice until ready for the 
table. Then pour off the ice and water, and serve. You will 
find them crisp and nice, prepared in this way. 

CUCUMBER SPIRALS 

Peel cucumbers and throw into ice water. Cut the chilled 
cucumber with a sharp knife, going round and round it till you 
have thin, long spirals. Lay in a salad bowl with cracked or 
shaved ice, and serve with the spirals French dressing. 

DANDELION SALAD 

Early in the spring young dandelions, very tender and fresh, 
are by many deemed a delicious and wholesome salad. The 
early root leaves are mostly white. Wash the leaves, separate 
them, and serve with a French dressing. See also ''Dande- 
lion Greens," page i86. 

FISH SALAD 

Sometimes you have a piece of fish left from dinner, such 
fish as fresh cod^ halibut, bass, red snapper. On such occa- 
sion keep it cold near ice till next day and make a delicious 
salad in this way: Free it from bone and skin, break it in 
small pieces, and in a bowl which you have rubbed with a 
juicy onion put a layer of the fish. Over this sprinkle salt 



156 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and lemon- juice, and lay on crisp white lettuce leaves. Dress 
the lettuce as you have the layer of fish, and then add more 
fish, which again you treat as you treated the first layer. 
So proceed till you have used your material. Spread over 
the top a layer of tartare sauce, chill, and serve. 

FISH SALAD 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Made from two pounds of cold boiled fish, or fish left 
over. Pick the meat free of bones, lay it in a china bowl, 
add four cloves, as many allspice, one minced red pepper, 
half a teaspoon of salt, and one teaspoon of minced parsley. 
Also add the juice of one lemon, one teacup of olive oil, 
stirring this in slowly, half a teacup of cider vinegar, one 
teaspoon of French mustard, and one small white onion 
minced exceedingly fine. Let this stand near ice overnight, 
and serve cold with lettuce or any salad green. 

FRENCH FRUIT SALAD 

Peel and cut into small pieces three oranges, three 
bananas, and an equivalent amount of pineapple. Fill lettuce 
cups with alternate layers of fruit. Dress with salad dress- 
ing, garnish with English walnut meats, and serve with 
cheese wafers. [See illustration, Plate XVI.] 

MACEDOINE SALAD 

Cut cooked turnips, carrots, and celery into small pieces. 
Add cooked peas, beans, and cauliflower, also broken in 
small pieces. Moisten with mayonnaise and let stand two 
hours. Scoop out small turnips, cook, and fill the shells with 
the salad. Serve on lettuce leaves. Cheese wafers are 
served with this salad. 

ORANGE SALAD 

Choose large, juicy, clean-skinned oranges. Cut each 
orange through the middle, and with a teaspoon scoop out 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 167 

the ptilp carefully, breaking it as slightly as possible. Lay 
the pulp on ice. With a sharp knife pare out the white pith 
on the inner part. Cut a thin slice from the end of each 
half to allow it to set firmly on the plate. When ready to 
serve sprinkle the pulp with powdered sugar, add a table- 
spoon of sherry to each tablespoon of orange-juice, and pour 
over the orange pulp. Heap the halves of the oranges full 
of the salad, garnish with white grapes and serve. 

OYSTER SALAD 

Beat together half a cup of cream and three eggs. Add 
a saltspoon of made mustard, salt and cayenne to taste, and 
two tablespoons of butter. Heat in a double-boiler, stir con- 
stantly, and when at boiling point two minutes add two 
tablespoons of vinegar. Cook two minutes more, and you 
then have a smooth sour cream. Have a quart of oysters 
merely brought to boil in their own liquor and cooled. Have 
also a pint of chopped celery. Mix the celery and oysters, 
pour over and mix in the cream dressing, and keep the salad 
cool till served. 

PINEAPPLE SALAD 

Be sure your pines are ripe and tender. Shred them 
thoroughly. Then add orange and lemon juice in the pro- 
portions given in the foregoing. Sugar to taste, and set 
away to chill. 

POTATO SALAD 

Boil six medium-sized potatoes until very tender, with 
salt in the water. Take each from the saucepan with a spoon 
to prevent breaking. Put them in a colander, and set aside 
until cold. When cold, cut them in somewhat thin slices 
across the potato. Lay in an earthen dish and sprinkle with 
parsley chopped very fine. Make the following dressing: 
!Mix in a small saucepan four egg^, two heaping teaspoons 
of salt, two heaping teaspoons of sugar, one small teaspoon 
of mustard, and four dashes of pepper. Stir this together. 



168 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and heat a little to mix well. Add gradually three-quarters 
of a teacup of vinegar. Set the saucepan in another con- 
taining water. Let the water come gradually to boil. Stir 
constantly with a tablespoon until the dressing is quite thick. 
Be careful not to let the egg curdle. Lift it now and then 
from the hot water, and stir, to prevent the curdling. When 
done take from the water and add two dashes of red pepper, 
one tablespoon of butter, three tablespoons of sweet milk or 
cream, and one-quarter of a teaspoon of onion- juice. Pour 
the dressing over the potatoes and carefully mix through. 
When done, the dressing should look creamy. If this quan- 
tity of dressing is not enough to make the salad moist, make 
more in the same proportion. Let the salad stand a few 
hours before serving. 

RADISHES AS SALAD 

Wash young, tender radishes in cold water, and cut oflF the 
tops to within an inch or three-quarters of an inch of the root 
Sometimes one or two leaves are left about two and a half 
inches long to save a stubby appearance and to take hold of the 
radish by. Put the radishes in ice water to cool and crisp, 
and serve lying on small pieces of ice in a flat dish. Do not 
peel the small button radish, but the long, large radish should 
be peeled and sliced in long slices. Dip the radish in salt, or 
a mixture of salt and pepper, as you eat. 

SPINACH SALAD 

After you have thoroughly washed the spinach, cook it in 
just enough water to keep it from sticking. Drop it into boiling 
water for the cooking. After it has boiled fifteen minutes salt 
the water, let boil five or ten minutes longer till it is tender, 
then tip into a colander to drain. After it has drained chop 
very fine and season with a little butter, pepper, and salt if 
your taste needs it, and pack in individual shells or cups. Chill 
in the ice-box and serve with a French dressing. If you pack 
it in shells you will not wish to disturb it, but serve it in its 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 159 

disb. If packed in cups as a mold, tip out on a lettuce leaf, and 
serve with the French dressing. 

SWEETBREAD SALAD 

After you have trimmed off the fat from fresh sweet- 
breads, wash in cold water and drop in boiling water enough 
to cover. Let them simmer till thoroughly parboiled, which 
win take about half an hour. Take from the water, cool, 
use a silver or wooden fork, and break in small pieces. Lay 
on crisp white lettuce leaves, and serve with a French 
dressing. 

TOMATO SALAD 

Strain one pint of tomato- juice, add one teaspoon of salt, a 
saltspoon of pepper, and one teaspoon of onion-juice. To this 
add a quarter of a box of gelatine. Put aside for half an hour 
to dissolve. Stir all together, put on the stove, let come to boil, 
take off, and pour into small cup (glass, or any other, that 
would be about the size of a tomato). Set it in a cold place 
to harden. Arrange two or three small lettuce leaves on a 
plate, turn the tomato jelly in the centre of the leaves, and use 
French or any other dressing. [See illustration, Plate XVI.] 

STUFFED TOMATO SALAD 

Carefully scald and remove the skins from medium-sized, 
firm tomatoes. Stand them in pounded ice until thoroughly 
chilled. Take out the seeds without breaking the fruit. Fill 
the tomatoes with chopped cucumber and cress; dress with 
Freniph dressing and serve on lettuce leaves. 

RED AND YELLOW TOMATO SALAD 

Peel red and yellow tomatoes, slice, and lay in alternate 
layers, and serve with French dressing or with a mayonnaise. 

TOMATO AND CAULIFLOWER SALAD 

Peel and slice ripe tomatoes. In a salad dish or bowl lay 
a slice of tomato and on this a few crumbs of scraped onion. 



160 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Next lay in pieces of cold boiled cauliflower and upon this put 
a little scraped onion. So make the layers till the dish is full. 
Over all pour a French dressing and set in ice-box to chill 
before eating. 

TOMATO JELLY 

In an earthen saucepan put a fine-chopped onion. Let it 
brown, then open a small can of tomatoes and pour in. Add 
also a stalk of celery broken in small pieces, a bay leaf, a large 
spoon of wine or cider vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt, and a 
dash of pepper or paprika. In quarter of a cup of cold water 
have dissolved half a cup of gelatine. Add this to the toma- 
toes, stir till all is thoroughly blended, and strain into a mold. 
If you mold the jelly so that it has an open centre, you can fill 
it in with a salad of cabbage, with nuts, or with any vegetable 
salad which will go well with it. 

TUXEDO SALAD WITH DRESSING 

Place one can of tomatoes in a saucepan over the fire, 
add one teaspoon each of butter, salt, and sugar, one-quarter 
of a teaspoon of pepper, and cook ten minutes. Then pour 
the tomatoes into a sieve, rub them through, and return them 
to the saucepan. Soak one ounce of gelatine in half a cup 
of cold water until soft. Add this to the tomatoes, stir over 
the fire until dissolved, then pour into a mold and set in a 
cool place until firm. 

Make a mayonnaise by putting the yolks of two eggs 
into a small double-boiler; add two tablespoons each of 
salad oil and white vinegar. Stir over the Are until this 
thickens, then remove at once, and when cold add slowly 
two more tablespoons of oil, stirring constantly. Add half 
a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of sugar, and three-quarters 
of a cup of whipped cream. 

Put one cup each of fine-cut white celery and fine-cut 
fresh pineapple into a bowl. Cook one cup of pecan meats 
ten minutes in salted water; drain, break the meats into 
small pieces, and add them to the mixture in the bowl. Mix 




SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 161 

this with half the mayonnaise, unmold the tomato into a 
round dish, put the salad in the centre, and garnish with 
pineapple leaves and thin slices of pineapple, cut with a 
scalloped cutter into crescent shapes. [For illustration, see 
Plate XVII.] 

FANCY VEGETABLE SALAD WITH DRESSING 

Sjcrape, wash, and cut into long slices one good-sized 
carrot; lay several slices over one another, and cut them into 
small strips like straws. Place the carrots in a saucepan, 
cover with boiling water, add half a teaspoon of sugar and 
cook until tender. Drain and set aside to cool. Cook half a 
pint of green peas in water with a little salt; when done, 
drain and add them to the carrots. Add to these half a pint 
of fine-cut boiled potatoes, half a pint of finely shaved cab- 
bage, two fine-cut boiled beets, and three fine-cut hard- 
boiled eggs. Make the salad dressing as follows: Put the 
yolks of three eggs into a bowl, set in cracked ice, stir three 
minutes, adding slowly one cup of oil while stirring (Con- 
stantly. Then add one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of 
English mustard, and, as the dressing thickens, add slowly 
one tablespoon of white vinegar, one tablespoon of fine- 
chopped onion and capers, one tablespoon of tarragon vine- 
gar, and half a pint of whipped cream. Mix half of this 
dressing with the vegetables, dress the salad in the centre of 
a salad dish, cover it with the remaining dressing, and 
garnish with fine-chopped beets, the whites of hard-boiled 
eggs, caviare, and put a small bunch of chives in the centre. 
[For illustration, see Plate XVIL] 

WALDORF SALAD 

This is one of the cheapest of all salads. It requires sour, 
crisp apples, cut in thin slices, and finely chopped celery. 
Blend lightly with a fine oil mayonnaise, garnish with the 
blanched feathery tops of the celery and scatter with halves 
of English walnuts. See "The Boon of an Apple Barrel," 
page 345- 



1C2 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

WATERCRESS SALAD 

Pick out sprightly, young cresses. Break off the bruised 
and yellowed leaves, and wash in several waters, so that it is 
freed from all dust, sand, clinging insects, and also from any 
typhoid fever germs. Remember that watercress grows in 
small country streams, where the water is sometimes sluggish, 
and there is chance of its being contaminated by bad drainage. 
Drop the cress lightly in a salad bowl and pour over it French 
dressing. Toss it with a wooden fork and spoon till all 
parts of the cress have taken up the dressing and serve cold. 

CREAM SALAD DRESSING 

Bring to boil in an earthen dish half a cup of vinegar, a tea- 
spoon of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper. Beat well the 
yolks of two eggs, gradually add the hot vinegar, stir, and 
also add three tablespoons of oil or butter, half a tablespoon 
of mustard, a teaspoon of sugar, and, lastly, six tablespoons 
of cream. Keep up a vigorous stirring as each ingredient 
is added. 

MILD CREAM DRESSING 

A mild cream dressing adds a relishing finish to vegetable 
salads and is preferred by many persons to a more piquant 
one. To make it, heat one cup of cream almost to boiling ; stir 
in one teaspoon of flour, wet up with a little cold milk or 
water; boil two minutes, stirring constantly; add two table- 
spoons of powdered sugar, stir well, then take off the fire. 
When half cold, beat in the whipped whites of two eggs; set 
on ice until quite cold ; then season with one teaspoon of salt, 
half as much black pepper, and a small quantity of prepared 
mustard. Beat the whole thoroughly ; then whip in two table- 
spoons of salad oil or soft butter. Just before pouring the 
dressing over the salad add, gradually, three tablespoons of 
vinegar. 

Unless salads are mixed at table — ^which is often done when 



SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 163 

the French dressing is used — they present a more inviting a(>- 
pearance if arranged at once for individual serving instead 
of being dished the second time. 

Next in importance to the making of a salad ranks its gar- 
nishings. How a dish looks exerts a wonderful influence upon 
the appetite; For this purpose one may use fringed celery 
stalks, fresh lettuce leaves, hard-boiled eggs, blood beets 
(boiled, then cut into various shapes), nasturtiums, powdered 
tarragon leaves, and the kernels of English walnuts. 

SOUR CREAM DRESSING 

To a cup of fresh sour cream allow a tablespoon of lemon- 
juice. Add to the juice, salt, cayenne pepper, and dry mus- 
tard to your taste. Stir these four ingredients together and 
then beat into the cup of cream till the cream puffs. Pour 
over the cold salad green and serve at once. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

Select a small bowl for the table, put into it one saltspoon 
of salt, a dash of pepper, a little dry mustard, and one saltspoon 
of sugar. To this add, gradually, a tablespoon of olive oil, 
stirring, to dissolve the ingredients. Stir smooth, and add two 
more tablespoons of olive oil, and one tablespoon of vinegar. 
Red pepper can be used if preferred, also more seasoning, .if 
the taste requires. 

HORSERADISH DRESSING 

Mix three tablespoons of fresh grated horseradish with a 
tablespoon of vinegar or of lemon- juice and a pinch of salt. 
Then stir in three tablespoons of whipped cream and a dash 
of cayenne. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Take two ice-cold eggs and separate the yolks from the 
whites. Into the yolks stir a third of a teaspoon of salt and a 
dash of pepper, and, drop by drop, olive oil, stirring continu- 



164 THE HOME COOK BOOIC 

oasly. You have now a thick mass ; add a few drops of lemon- 
juice or vinegar, and stir ; then oil again and stir, then lemon- 
juice or vinegar, till you have the quantity and consistency 
you wish. If it is to your taste, add onion-juice or half a tea- 
spoon of made mustard, or a drop or two of mint. The lemon- 
juice or vinegar is the thinning ingredient, and constant stir- 
ring is essential to successful making of the dressing. Set 
on the ice, and just before serving add a tablespoon of whipped 
or plain thick cream. The yolk of a hard-boiled egg may 
also be beaten in with the cream. To make the yolk smooth 
rub it first through a sieve, and then stir into the dressing. 
This dressing is dropped with a small spoon on peeled 
tomatoes, lettuce> asparagus, chicken^ and is a heartier salad 
dressing than French dressing.

Potatoes 

TO BAKE POTATOES 

CHOOSE smooth potatoes, of equal size 'so far as may be, 
and large, for a small potato baked is apt to be nothing 
but skin. Wash the potatoes clean, dry with a cloth, chip off 
the skin at either end to allow the steam to escape and help to 
the potatoes' mealiness, put in a hot oven and bake, allowing 
from forty to sixty minutes for the roasting. The difference 
in the quality of potatoes, and difference in size, and also in 
the temperature of the oven, require considerable latitude in 
the time for cooking. 

TO BOIL NEW POTATOES 

Use a coarse cloth for rubbing off the skin of the pota- 
toes. While washing, cut a small piece from the ends of 
each potato to help to their boiling. Drop them in boiling 
water without salt and boil till done. They may be served 
whole and plain to eat with butter, or a cream dressing may 
be made by pouring new milk on the cooked potatoes, and 
thickening the milk with a tablespoon or two of flour — ^the 
flour used according to the quantity of the milk, a tablespoon 
to a pint of milk. To the milk add salt to your taste. 

BOILED POTATOES 

After you have peeled and rinsed in cold water potatoes of 
moderate size put them in a kettle of boiling water. Have 



166 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

enough water to cover the potatoes and put them in about 
three-quarters of an hour before they are to be served. Cover 
the pot close and cook half an hour. Ten minutes before the 
half hour is up add salt in the proportion of a teaspoonful to 
every four potatoes. After they have boiled half an hour 
pour off the water and set them on the back part of the stove. 
If you keep the metal cover on the pot, slip it a little to one 
side to allow the steam to escape and save the potatoes from 
becoming soggy. A cloth spread over the pot while the 
potatoes are steaming is better than the metal cover. Serve 
in a hot dish. 

CREAMED POTATOES 

Follow the directions given above to the instant of setting 
the pot on the back of the stove. Instead, after pouring off 
the water, add enough sweet cream to half bury the potatoes 
and set over the fire till the cream is brought to boil. Then 
take from the fire, let stand on the back of the stove for five 
minutes so that the potatoes will melt into, or absorb, the 
cream, and serve in a hot vegetable dish. Sprigs of green 
parsley may be laid on the potatoes, or they may be dusted 
with black pepper. 

FRIED POTATOES 

Slice across and not too thin cold boiled potatoes. Spread 
out, and salt and pepper them. Put in a frying-pan with hot 
lard enough to heat and brown them. Cover, because they 
brown better when covered. Set over a moderately hot fire. 
Turn the potatoes every now and then, or rather, stir them 
over with a large broad-bladed knife. Brown slowly, care- 
fully, and a light brown. When done, put them in some place 
for a short time for the grease to dry off. Serve hot. 

Raw potatoes are cooked in the same way, but are cut 
differently. Cut them lengthwise in thin pieces. Before fry- 
ing, soak them in cold water half an hour. 

Cold sweet potatoes are very nice fried in this same way. 



POTATOES AND SWEET POTATOES 167 

but they require more grease and do not dry off as much. 
Serve very hot. 

MASHED POTATOES 

Peel and boil the potatoes tender, tip off the water in 
which they were cooked and have them dry in the pot or sauce- 
pan. Sprinkle salt to taste and mash them thoroughly with 
a masher. Drop in a lump of butter to your taste and add 
cream of fresh milk, never water, for a softener and binder. 
Then beat mashed potatoes, milk, and butter together vigor- 
ously till they are white and foamy. Put in a hot vegetable 
dish and do not mash the potatoes down with a knife, but 
sprinkle with pepper, drop a small lump of butter in the middle 
and serve hot and at once. 

MASHED POTATO WITH CHEESE RELISH 

After you have boiled and mashed the potatoes you wish to 
use, soften them with a plentiful supply of milk so that addi- 
tional .cooking will not harden, and smooth them lightly in a 
baking dish. Through the centre of the potatoes make a 
deep, broad X. Glaze the potato with the white of an egg 
and set in the oven. Stir four tablespoons of cheese gyrated or 
cut in small bits into a saucepan holding four tablespoons of 
hot butter. Mix well, and pour slowly upon the yolks of two 
eggs which you have already well beaten. Season with salt 
and pepper, and pour the mixture in the broad X of the 
mashed potato. Let it run thoroughly through the channels 
so that taking a spoonful of the potatoes you will get some of 
the cheese sauce. After pouring in the sauce, spread bread- 
crumbs over, brown for a moment in the oven, and serve hot. 

MASHED POTATO WITH ONION AND BACON 

Cut bacon into thin slices, not much thicker than a knife 
blade. Cut the slices across, in small pieces. Slice one 
medium-sized onion very thin. Cut this in small pieces, like 
the bacon. Have a frying-pan with a trifle of hot lard to fry 



168 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the onion and bacon a nice brown. Fry the fat of the bacon 
all out, so that the meat will be crisp. Have ready a hot vege- 
table dish of mashed potato. Smooth it over the top. Shape 
it higher in the centre. With a spoon press down a place in the 
middle. Pour into it the bacon, onicHi, and fat. A spoon is 
used to serve this dish. The mixture will penetrate it and 
give a savory flavor to the mashed potato. 

MASHED POTATO AND TURNIP WITH SAUSAGE 
Peel and cut in small pieces enough potatoes to fill a quart 
measure and enough turnips to fill a pint measure. Cook the 
turnips longer than the potatoes, for they are a tougher vege- 
table. After they have become a little tender, add the potatoes 



and boil tilt done. Drain off the water, salt, add a tablespoon 
of butter, mash, and beat till soft and white, and serve hot 
with fried pork sausages as a meat. 

PUFFED POTATOES 
Boil and mash through a sieve six large mealy potatoes. 
Add one tablespoon of butter, one teaspoon of salt, one small 
white onion minced fine, one teaspoon of minced parsley, and 
one teacup of sweet cream or milk. Stir briskly, adding two 
raw eggs separately. Roll a tablespoon of this in flour and 
fry in a deep pan of boiling lard to make the puffs. Do not 
put in too many puffs at a time or they will stick together. 
The puffs must float in the lard and brown evenly. When 
crisp, remove to a cTish and dust with a little fine salt 



POTATOES AND SWEET POTATOES 169 

RIBBONS OF POTATOES 

Peel the skin from the potatoes, and then peel round and 
round, making a thin spiral ribbon of the potato. Let the 
ribbons lie in cold water an hour, drain, put in a frying basket 
and plunge into hot fat. Drain the fat from the ribbons by 
laying them a minute on blotting paper, sprinkle with salt 
and serve hot. 

SCALLOPED POTATOES 

Slice raw potatoes in thin slices. Lay them in cold water 
for one hour. Put them in a pudding dish in layers, season- 
ing each layer highly with salt, pepper, and lumps of butter. 
Fill the dish in this way, and cover with cold milk. Set in a 
hot oven. Put a pan of warm water in the upper oven above it. 
Cook imtil the potatoes are very tender. Give them time to 
cool a little before putting on the table. Use plenty of butter 
for this dish to make it successful. 

STEWED POTATOES 

Chop fine, potatoes that have been cooked the day before. 
Put them into a saucepan. Pour over enough milk to almost 
cover, salt to make a good flavor, and add a large piece of 
butter (probably an iron spoonful), according to the quantity 
you may have. Set the saucepan into another containing 
water, being careful to have but little water. Boil hard one 
hour until creamy. Stir occasionally. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

Choose rather large sized potatoes and all about of the 

same size. Wash clean and bake till mealy in a moderate 

oven. Split each potato in two, scoop out the inside and with 

it mix salt, butter, milk, and a little pepper — all to your taste. 

Stir in the beaten white of an egg to each three potatoes, tuck 

back the seasoned potato in the skins, press the halves of the 

skins close together, and brown in the oven. Serve the pota-

Take two cups of mashed, boiled, steamed, or baked 
sweet potatoes; add the beaten yolks of two eggs and season 
to taste ; stir over the fire until the mass parts from the sides 
of the pan. When cold form into small croquettes, roll in 
egg and breadcrumbs, and fry in hot lard to an amber color. 
Serve on napkins. The croquette mixture may be made into 
balls inclosing minced meat. When used in this way serve

BAKED NAVY BEANS 

WASH thoroughly. Put in a crock to soak overnight. 
Three pints of beans will make two average-sized bak- 
ing dishes of baked beans. In the morning put the beans in a 
granite soup kettle. Pour over them the water in which they 
have been soaked and add warm water enough to come a little 
more than two inches above the beans. After they have 
cooked an hour add three-quarters of a pound of fat salt pork. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste and one tablespoon of 
white sugar. Boil slowly and steadily five hours. After they 
begin to thicken, set the pot on an asbestos plate to prevent 
burning. Stir occasionally, and taste as to seasoning of salt 
and pepper. If the beans are needed for an evening meal, after 
they have boiled the given time, set them where they will keep 
hot without cooking any more. One hour before they are 
needed turn them into a colander. Drain off the liquor, of 
which there will be very little, as the beans will be soft. Put 
them in the pudding dish to within one inch or less from the 
top. Pour over a little of the liquid. Score the pork three or 
four times and put it in the middle of the beans. Set in the 
upper oven of the stove and brown lightly, and serve. 

The next day make into cakes the same as potato cakes. 
Dip your hands in cold water and mold the beans into shape. 
Put them in a frying-pan with just enough lard to brown. 
Cover while browning. They should be slightly crisp. In 
browning potato cakes or beans, or anything of that sort, never 
turn tfaem until they are thoroughly brown, or they will lose 



174 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

their shape and not be satisfactory. In cooking this quantity 
of beans you will probably have a dish ready for the next day. 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS 
Soak overnight one quart of small white beans. Next 
morning cover with water and let come to boil, but do not 
boil. Set back and simmer a few minutes and pour off the 
water. Have a bean pot ready; put in the beans; stir in salt 
to taste, and two tablespoons of molasses ; place in the centre 



a piece of scored, fat salt pork weighing three-quarters of a 
pound; add enough water to rise to the top of the beans; 
cover tight and bake all day, with an even, slow heat 

BAKED BEANS WITH TOMATO SAUCE 
Proceed as in the foregoing directions until you put the 
beans in the pot. At that point, instead of adding the water, 
add a quart of stewed and strained tomafoes, seasoned with 
a teaspoon of salt and a heaping tablespoon of sugar. Pour 
this over the beans and pork ; open here and there with a fork 
for the tomato sauce to run down and season the beans ; cover 
the pot tight and bake slowly all day. 

FRESH LIMA OR BUTTER BEANS 

Put the beans in cold water for half an hour. Pour off 

the cold water. Put them in a saucepan and cover with hot 

water. After a few minutes' boiling, season with salt and 

pepper. Salt the beans carefully, as it is very easy to spoil 



BEANS, PEAS, AND LENTILS 176 

them. They will require a little more pepper than other vege- 
tables. When nearly done, and when but little water is left 
on them, add a large, tablespoon of butter, and finish cooking. 
Do not have too much liquor over them when served. If you 
find you have too much water when they are finished, pour 
them into a colander and drain. Put them back in the sauce- 
pan and add whatever liquor you need. In this way you will 
not waste butter. 

DRIED LIMA BEANS 

Wash the beans in three cold waters. Put them into a 
crock, cover with cold water, and soak overnight. Next day 
cover with warm water. When they have boiled five minutes, 
pour oflF the water, and add fresh warm water. Do this twice 
more. Let the last water you cover them with be hot. Season 
carefully with salt and pepper. Allow two hours for the cook- 
ing. When nearly done add one large tablespoon of butter. 
If you are not ready to use them set them aside, and heat 
when needed by setting them in a saucepan of hot water. In 
cooking beans, or any vegetable likely to stick, set an asbestos 
plate tmdemeath and it will need no watching. Almost any 
vegetable for evening use can be cooked in the morning and 
heated in this way. Some dishes are even better by standing. 

LIMA BEAN CROQUETTES 

Put left-over Lima beans through a colander, and to every 
cup of the bean pulp stir in an egg, a tablespoon of onion- juice, 
and, if you have it, a tablespoon of tomato sauce. Make little 
round croquettes, or flat cakes if you prefer. Dip each cake in 
a raw egg on a plate and then into rolled cracker-crumbs and 
fry an even brown in hot fat. Serve hot. 

STEWED STRING BEANS 

Be sure the beans are young, crisp, and tender. Break 
the stem end and pull it back, thus removing the string. Cut 
the bean pods into three pieces with a knife. As you cut, 



176 THE HOM£ COOK BOOK 

throw them into a pan of cold water. When they are ready, 
throw them into boiling water slightly salted, and cook gently 
about forty-five minutes. Tip them in a colander to drain. 
Put back in the saucepan and mix in butter ; salt and pepper to 
taste. Let them stand in a gentle, even heat for a few minutes 
to gain taste from the seasoning. 

CREAMED STRING BEANS 

From two quarts of beans, take off the strings and cut the 
pods, as directed in the foregoing receipt. Throw into a pan 
of cold water as you cut them. Have enough boiling water 
slightly salted to cover and boil gently till, tender, which will 
be in about forty-five minutes. Pour the beans in a colander. 
In the saucepan pour a cup of fresh milk and when it boils stir 
in a tablespoon of fiour mixed with a tablespoon of butter. As 
this thickens to a cream stir in the drained beans. Stir the 
beans about in their cream and let them stand in a gentle, 
even heat a few minutes before serving. A dash of cayenne 
may be added if agreeable to the taste. 

CREAMED PEAS 

This is a delicate way of serving canned peas; but fresh 
peas are served in the same way, and they very often were by 
our grandmothers before canned peas were known. In using 
fresh peas boil the peas till done. In using canned peas take 
a can of peas, pour off their liquid and pour over cold water 
to rinse them. Now in a saucepan cook a tablespoon of 
flour in two tablespoons of butter, add the drained peas, 
and then two-thirds of a cup of milk. Heat and stir 
and add also a tablespoon of sugar, and salt and pepper to 
taste. 

Instead of butter and milk, pure rich cream may be used. 
This was formerly the country fashion. The cream was 
slightly thickened by stirring in a tablespoon of flour as it 
boiled. 



BEANS, PEAS, AND LENTILS 177 

CANNED PEAS 

It is unsafe to leave anything in the way of canned goods 
in the can after it is opened. The contents should be poured 
out at once. Select the finest brand of peas, open a quart 
can and pour the peas into a colander. Drain off the liquor 
and throw it away. Pour cold water over the peas until they 
are well rinsed. It is easiest to put them under running water 
if that water is pure. Next put them in a saucepan. Add 
three iron spoons of cold water, one even teaspoon of sugar, 
and one teaspoon of salt. Taste as to seasoning and make as 
near as possible that of a sweet pea. Add one full table- 
spoon of butter. Set this saucepan in another pan contain- 
ing hot water. Do not cover the peas as the added steam 
will make too much liquid. Stir every now and then, or the 
peas will turn black. Cook half an hour, and no more, and 
be particular there is always water in the under saucepan. If 
you are not ready to serve at once set where the peas will 
keep hot. 

STEWED LENTILS 

Wash a pint of lentils, cover with fresh water and soak 
all night. In the morning pour off the water; have enough 
water boihng in the pot to cover the lentils. Drop them in 
and slowly boil an hour and a quarter. Tip them from the pot 
in a colander and drain. Put back in the pot; heat slowly, 
adding a heaping tablespoon of butter, a teaspoon of salt, and 
a tablespoon of onion- juice, and serve. 

LENTIL CAKES 

Press through a colander cold, left-over lentils, stewed 
according to the preceding receipt. Season to your taste with 
salt and pepper and then add to help hold the cup of pulp to- 
gether an egg or a little thick cream. Make into cakes with 
the hand ; dip in a raw egg broken on a plate, then into rolled 
cracker-crumbs and fry till brown in hot Jat. Serve hot.

BOILED ARTICHOKES 

TRIM the artichokes neatly and cut away the stems and 
outer leaves, which are tough. Soak half an hour to free 
from any insect which may have crept in the leaves. Have 
boiling enough salted water to cover the artichokes. Add a 
few drops of vinegar to the water and lay in the vegetables. 
Boil nearly or quite two hours. When thoroughly done drain 
and serve with drawn butter. 

BOILED ASPARAGUS 

Wash the asparagus in cold water and cut oflf the tough 
ends. Scrape the white part which remains and throw into 
cold water for thirty minutes. Tie in small bundles and put 
into a kettle of boiling water. A tin kettle is the best, for 
the reason that thicker vessels do not boil fast enough. Tin 
asparagus boilers come for this purpose. Boil until tender, 
adding a little salt to the water. Now have ready slices of 
toast, which should be cold. If the loaf of bread is small. 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 179 

use the whole slice ; if large, half a slice. Heat as many plates 
as you have tied bunches, and jnelt butter enough for all. 
Dip the toast quickly into the hot asparagus water, lay a piece 
on a plate; sprinkle a very little salt on this, and pour over 
it a small quantity of the melted butter. Lift a bunch of the 
asparagus from the water with a fork, cut the string with 
scissors and draw it away. Sprinkle more salt on the asparagus 
and pour over it melted butter. Serve hot, a bunch and a 
piece of toast to a plate. 

SCALLOPED ASPARAGUS 

Wash a large bunch of asparagus, cut in inch lengths, 
drop in boiling water and boil ten minutes. Have five eggs 
boiled hard and chopped fine. In a baking dish put a layer of 
the asparagus, over this sprinkle the chopped egg and add 
salt, pepper, and small bits of butter. Again put on a layer 
of asparagus, and again the chopped Qgg and seasoning. 
Have the top layer of the vegetable. Into a cup and a half of 
hot milk stir two tablespoons of flour which has been wet 
with a little of the milk. When the milk thickens pour it 
over the vegetable in the pudding dish, add a topping off of 
breadcrumbs, and bake in a hot oven from ten to twenty 
minutes. 

BAKED BANANAS 

A CUBAN DISH 

Remove one section of peel from each banana, and lay 
the bananas lengthwise in an earthen baking dish with this ex- 
posed side up. Stick the fruit with a fork. Squeeze over each 
banana the juice of quarter of a lemon, and on each banana 
lay one teaspoon of sugar and a lump of butter the size of 
a pea. Grate a little nutmeg over each banana. Add some 
water in the bottom of the pan to keep from burning, and 
bake half an hour in a moderate oven. For special occasions 
it is recommended to add one teaspoon of sherry or marsala 
to each banana. 



180 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

FRIED PLANTAIN OR BANANA 

A LOUISIANA RECEIPT 

If plantain is not available, use the large bananas that have 
green ends. Slice the fruit lengthwise, dip the slices in white 
of egg, dust them with flour, and fry in a deep pan of boiling 
lard. When brown, remove to a flat dish, and sprinkle with 
powdered sugar. Serve with the roast. ' 

TO BOIL BEETS 

Wash the beets and cook till soft. The time for cooking 
is difficult to say. Sometimes when young and tender the 
beets will cook soft in an hour. Again they need four hours. 
And not cooked soft they are tasteless and indigestible, and 
should be tabooed. When cooked slip off the skin, slice and 
serve hot with butter spread upon them. 

TO COOK BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Let the sprouts lie for half an hour in cold water strongly 
salted, so that any insects which have burrowed in them will 
come to the surface. Then drop them in boiling water, allow- 
ing a quart of water to a pint of sprouts. After they have 
boiled fifteen minutes add a small tablespoon of salt for the 
quantity named above, and boil till tender. The time will be 
twenty minutes or half an hour. Do not cook them till they 
mush. 

After they have boiled the sprouts may be served in three 
forms. First, they may be served plain-boiled, as directed 
above. A second way is to drain ofiF the water in which they 
were boiled, and to add a dash of pepper, a cup of cream in 
which a teaspoon of flour has been stirred, and to simmer ten 
minutes, and serve. A third way is to drain off the water in 
which the sprouts are boiled, to place them in a saucepan with 
a tablespoon of butter, a dash of celery salt, and a minced red 
pepper, to brown a little, and serve. 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 181 

BOILED CABBAGE 

Select a firm bead of cabbage. Cut in large pieces. Cut 
out the core and lay the cabbage in cold water for half an hour. 
At the end of that time put into a granite kettle with enough 
boiling water to cover, and cook until very tender. Drain well 
before serving. 

Another nice way to prepare cabbage after boilii^ is to 
put it in a saucepan, chop it with a strong knife, rather 
coarse, season it with salt and a little red pepper to taste, half 
a cup of vinegar and two tablespoons of melted butter. 
Mix this together and cook five minutes and serve, very hot. 

TO MAKE SAUERKRAUT 

Choose large cabbages with white heads, take off the outer 
leaves and shred the cabbages very fine. Lay the outer leaves 
round the sides and bottom of a cask or tub. Then put in the 
shredded cabbage in layers about three inches deep, sprinkling 
each layer with a handful of salt. Press down the layers and 
repeat the cabbage and salt till you have used your material. 
Then put on a layer of outer leaves, spread a cloth over the 
top and also a cover smaller than the top of the cask. Put a 
heavy weight on the cover — for instance, a perfectly clean 
stone. Set the cask in a warm place till the cabbage begins 
to ferment, then set it in a cool place. In making the change 
skim off the scum, wash the cloth, and wash or replace the 
outer leaves. Let the fermentation go on between two and 
three weeks. The sauerkraut is then ready for use. 

TO COOK SAUERKRAUT 

Wash the sauerkraut well in water, drain and put in a pot 
holding boiling water. Cook till the sauerkraut is tender, which 
will be in from two to three hours. If the water boils out 
add boiling water. Sauerkraut is eaten with fresh and salt 
pork, with corned beef, with smoked sausage, and with similar 
hearty dishes. 



182 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

STEWED CARROTS 

Have your carrots tender and young, not hard and pithy, 
as they grow with age. Wash, scrape, and cut them in small 
dice, or cut in slices and the slices again in halves and quar- 
ters. So prepare a quart. Cover with boiling water and boil 
for nearly or quite an hour. Carrots are not apt to be tender 
with less cooking. Test to see, and boil longer if necessary. 
When tender, pour off the water, add a small pint of milk, a 
small teaspoon of salt, and stir in a heaping tablespoon of 
flour mixed with a heaping tablespoon of butter. Cook up and 
stir till the flour thickens the milk. Then serve. 



CARROTS WITH ONION 

Wash and scrape young carrots and cut them in slices and 
the slices again in halves and quarters. Cover with boiling 
water and boil an hour or until tender. Then pour off the 
water, put the carrots in a saucepan and to every pint of car- 
rots stir in a tablespoon of butter blended with a tablespoon 
of flour and a pinch of salt. Let the carrots cook gently with 
this mixture, add a tablespoon of onion- juice or of minced 
onion and a dash of cayenne, allowing this quantity to a pint, 
and then serve hot. 



CAULIFLOWER 

Pick off all the outer leaves. Cut oflF some of the stalks, 
leaving enough to hold the cauliflower together while boiling. 
Wash it thoroughly in cold water. Put in a granite pot and 
cover with boiling water. Salt to taste, which will be near 
a tablespoon. Boil it steadily. It takes about fifteen minutes' 
steady boiling for a good-sized head of cauliflower, and ten 
minutes' for a small one. When done, take from the pot and 
carefully cut it apart. Lay it on a napkin in a hot vegetable 
dish. Turn the corners of the napkin over it. Serve with 
drawn butter. 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 188 

STEWED CELERY 

Scrape and wash the stalks of a large bunch. Cut into 
pieces one inch long. Lay in cold water fifteen minutes. Put 
in a saucepan and cover with boiling water. Add one tea- 
spoon of salt, and boil until tender. When done, put in a 
colander and drain. Save the water. Again put the celery 
in a saucepan. Nearly cover it with milk. Add three table- 
spoons of the water in which the celery boiled. Mash together 
one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of flour. As the 
milk begins to heat, stir in the mixed butter and flour. Stir 
continually until it thickens a little. Season with salt if needed 
and white pepper, and serve. 

CREAMED CELERY 

Wash the celery, cut in small pieces, and put in a saucepan 
with enough cold water to cook and steam it. Cover tight and 
boil till the celery is tender. There should be little wat^ re- 
maining. Pour on cream in the proportion of a cup to two 
cups of the celery. Salt to taste ; boil up and thicken the cream 
by adding a tablespoon of flour to two cups of cream, dissolv- 
ing the flour in a little milk. Cook till the cream thickens, 
pepper to taste, and serve hot. 

CORN BAKED IN THE HUSK 

Lay ears of green com in their husks in a hot oven and 
bake twenty to twenty-five minutes. Take off the husks and 
silk, with a sharp knife run down every row of kernels, so 
that the inside will come out when pressed by the teeth and 
the hard hull stay on the com. Serve hot and eat with salt 
and butter. 

BAKED GREEN CORN 

A MISSISSIPPI DISH 

Score eight ears of com and scrape into a baking-pan. 
Add one cup of sweet cream, one tablespoon of butter, half 
a teaspoon of salt, and a dash of red pepper. Beat in llie 



184 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

yolks of two eggs. Add the beaten whites of the eggs, and 
bake in* a moderate oven one hour. Be careful to score and 
scrape the corn from the cob; do not cut it off. 

BAKED CORN 

Chop fine two cups of canned com. Beat an egg and 
stir it in, add a tablespoon of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 
and half a cup of milk. Beat all together, pour in a buttered 
pudding dish and bake till the whole is firm. 

TO COOK CANNED CORN 

Select the best canned corn. Turn it out the moment 
the can is opened, and put the corn in a saucepan. For a 
one-pound can of corn, add about one even teaspoon of salt 
and one even teaspoon of sugar. Mix this through the com, 
and taste for seasoning. It should be salted to slightly taste 
of the salt, and just enough sugar to give a sweet com flavor. 
Add three iron spoons of cold water. If, after cooking for 
a short time, a little more water is needed, add it. Put into 
the com a large tablespoon of butter, and no pepper. Set the 
saucepan in another, with water undemeath, not having too 
much water in the under saucepan. Set on the stove, without 
covering, and boil half an hour. If you cover, the steam from 
the cover will make the com watery. 

SUCCOTASH 

Succotash is generally better made from the best canned 
com. Cook the com as described under "Canned Com" above. 
Also cook the beans as directed under "Dried Lima Beans." 
When the beans have been cooked tender, pour them into a 
colander and drain off the water, and stir them into the com. 
For a one-pound can of com it will take about one pint of 
Lima beans. After the beans are added, it may require a 
little more water and butter to make them sufficiently juicy. 
If so, add it. Corn and beans should be cooked separately 
for succotash. Use no pepper, and no more seasoning, as 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 186 

both com and beans are seasoned. If you wish to make 
this dish of canned Lima beans, add them in the same manner 
and the same qnantity after you have drained off the liquid 
in which they are canned, and rinsed and seasoned them. 

CORN OYSTERS 

Take fresh, sweet com and with a sharp knife cut down 
the centre of each row of kemels. Scrape out the pulp, 
leaving the kernels on the cob. Hold your cobs over a bowl 
as you scrape out the pulp. Allow the yolk of an egg to one 
cut of pulp. Season to taste with butter, salt and pepper, 
and just before you begin to fry add the white of the egg 
beaten to a stiff froth. Have ready a griddle or frying-pan 
heated hot and covered with melted butter. Drop the com 
batter from a spoon and it will form in the shape and size 
of oysters. Fry a light brown and serve hot on a hot plate. 

BOILED EGGPLANT 

Cut the eggplant in two and boil till soft. Take the pulp 
out of the shells. Have ready two or three slices of bacon and 
an onion or two minced together. Mix with the pulp, add a 
few grated breadcrumbs, pack back in the shells, sprinkle 
with breadcrumbs, put on bits of butter or a few drops of olive 
oil and set in the oven to brown. 

EGGPLANT IN CREOLE FASHION 

Put a large fresh eggplant in boiling water, cook five 
minutes, remove and drain. When cold, cut off the top and 
scoop out the inside. Cook one tablespoon of fine chopped white 
onion in one tablespoon of butter. Add two tablespoons of 
chopped mushrooms and two tablespoons of chopped green 
peppers. Cook a few minutes without browning; then add 
three slices of stale bread that have been soaked in water, stir 
and cook five minutes. Remove from fire, season with half a 
teaspoon of sah, one-quarter of a teaspoon of pepper, and add 
two whole eggs. Mix this filling into the eggplant and re- 



186 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

place the top as a cover. Lay a square piece of cheesecloth on 
the table, and place a few thin slices of larding pork on the 
cloth. Put the eggplant on top and roll it in the cloth. Tie 
the cloth on both ends and put it in a deep round pan. Add 
half a can of tomatoes, one ounce of butter, half a teaspoon of 
salt, one teaspoon of sugar, a little pepper, half a tablespoon 
of fine-chopped onions and green peppers, and half a cup of 
stock or sour cream. Cover the pan tightly, place it in a 
medium hot oven to bake one hour. Shortly before serving, 
remove the eggplant, free it from the cloth, place it on a 
warm dish and garnish with baked tomatoes and potato balls. 
Rub the tomatoes in which the eggplant was cooked through 
a sieve and serve them with the eggplant. If mushrooms are 
not to be had, they may be omitted. [See illustration, Plat« 
XIX.] 

FRIED EGGPLANT 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Salt the slices of eggplant and lay them in a china dish. 
Cover with a cloth and lay a weight on the cloth to press out 
the bitter juice and make the vegetable tender. Let stand half 
an hour. Then wash off the salt and dry the slices in a fresh 
cloth. Dip them in white of egg and then in flour, and fry 
in a deep pan of boiling lard. 

STUFFED EGGPLANT 

Boil an eggplant half an hour. Then cut it in two hemi- 
spheres and scrape out the pulp. Mash with two tablespoons 
of butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Beat the seasoned pulp, 
put it back in the skins, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and brown 
in the oven a few minutes before serving. 

GREENS 

Wash young spring dandelions, or beet tops, or purslane, 
or sourdock, in several waters before putting in boiling water* 
Cook for an hour or more — that is, cook till tender. The time 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 187 

varies with the condition of the greens. Add salt half an 
hour before they are done. When done, drain, press in bowl 
or mold, and serve with some such fat meat as boiled ham and 
a dash of vinegar. Cooked dandelions may also be made into 
a salad, served with a French dressing or mayonnaise. 

KALE 

Strip off the leaves and wash them thoroughly. Then cook 
till tender in boiling water. Drain, season with salt, butter, 
and pepper, and serve with hard-boiled egg cut in slices and 
laid over the pressed kale. A jowl of the pig or a ham end 
is sometimes cooked with the kale for the flavor it gives the 
vegetable and for a meat to eat with it. 

TO COOK KOHLRABI 
Follow rules for cooking turnips. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS 

Be sure you have the edible mushroom, not the poisonous 
toadstool. Scrape the stem and cut off the earthy part. Wash 
in cold water and take the skin from the top. Put them in 
a porcelain saucepan, half cover with water and stew till 
tender, which will be in about twenty minutes or half an 
hour. Salt, thicken, allowing a tablespoon of flour stirred in 
a tablespoon of butter to a pint of the mushrooms. Pepper 
may be added if wished. 

Canned mushrooms are stewed in the same way, requiring 
less cooking. 

MUSHROOMS STUFFED WITH CHICKEN 

Procure eight or ten good-sized fresh mushrooms of an 
even size, cut off the stems, remove the gills, peel neatly, drop 
them as soon as peeled in a bowl of cold water, to which one 
gill of lemon-juice has been added. Chop the mushroom 
stems fine and place a saucepan with a small fine-chopped 



188 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

white onion and one tablespoon of butter over the fire. Cook 
two minutes. Add the chopped mushroom stems. Cook 
slowly five minutes, season with one-quarter of a teaspoon 
of salt, a little pepper, and fine chopped parsley. Remove, 
and when cold divide this mixture among the well-drained 
mushrooms. Chop fine the breast of a chicken and rub it 
through a sieve, then weigh it; tiiere should be four ounces, 
good weight. Put the meat in a bowl, add, in small portions, 
two and a half ounces of butter, stirring continually with a 
potato masher. When this is well mixed, add slowly the 
whites of two eggs and mix well. Season with half a tea- 
spoon of salt, a little nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. Place for 
one hour on ice, then add half a pint of whipped cream. Fill 
the mushrooms with this forcemeat. Set the mushrooms in 
a buttered pan, place them in the oven with good bottom heat, 
cover the top with buttered paper (but in a way that the 
paper will not touch the forcemeat) and bake till the force- 
meat is firm to the touch. Serve with cream sauce. [See 
illustration, Plate XIX.] 

BOILED OKRA 

Wash young okra and cut the spears in slices about half an 
inch thick. Have boiling in a porcelain saucepan enough salted 
water to almost cover the okra. Drop in the slices, cover and 
boil gently till tender, which will be in from twenty-five to 
forty minutes. The water will be almost boiled away. To a 
quart of okra stir in a heaping tablespoon of butter, a table- 
spoon of vinegar, and, if you like it, a dash of catsup and 
cayenne. Serve hot. This vegetable is oftenest eaten with 
chicken. 

FRIED OKRA WITH HAM 

A LOUISIANA DISH 

In a porcelain saucepan fry half a potmd of minced boiled 
ham in a tablespoon of butter and add two minced onions. 
When browned add two dozen sliced spears of okra. Stir 
constantly until the okra browns. Add one teacup of tomato- 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 189 

juice, allow it to simmer down until all the juice is absorbed 
and the vegetables begin to brown again, when the okra will 
be done. Serve in a vegetable dish. 

^ BAKED ONIONS 

Peel white onions and have a Boston bean pot for their 
baking. Put a layer of onions in the pot and sprinkle in half 
a teaspoon of salt and lay in a tablespoon of butter. Add 
half a cup of boiling water. Repeat this layer with the salt 
and butter, and as many times as you wish to make the quan- 
tity of onions. Set the cover of the pot on tight and bake in 
a moderate oven four or five hours. The closed pot does not 
allow the fumes to escape and annoy people, and no one 
knows you are cooking a most wholesome vegetable. Onions 
may be cooked this way without water or butter, in their own 
juice. Do not have the oven too hot. 

BOILED ONIONS 

Peel good-sized white onions, taking off the thick outer 
skin. Lay in cold water half an hour, and then put them in 
a tin saucepan of boiling water. Boil ten minutes, then pour 
off the water and cover again with fresh boiling water. Add 
a little salt. Boil until tender enough to allow a straw to run 
through. When done, turn out carefully into a colander. 
Lift each one with a spoon and lay into a hot vegetable dish. 
Sprinkle over each a good deal of salt and pour over a small 
quantity of melted butter ; no pepper. 

CREAMED ONIONS 

Peel the onions, cover with salted boiling water and cook 
till they are quite tender all through. Onions of average size 
commonly take one hour or at times one hour and a half to 
cook through thoroughly. Pour off the water that remains — 
much will have boiled away — and add enough sweet cream 
to rise through the onions and half cover them. Boil up and 
taste. If they need salt, add a little. Take each onion 



190 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

separately from the saucepan and lay it in the servii^ dish 
in order to keep its form perfect. Pour over the hot cream 
and serve. 

SPANISH ONIONS STUFFED 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Remove the hearts from the onions. Boil the outer part 
fifteen minutes, taking care they remain firm. Fry the 
minced hearts of the onions in a tablespoon of butter. Add 
one teacup of cracker-crumbs and one teacup of sweet cream, 
a teaspoon of celery seed, a dash of cayenne pepper, and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Beat in one egg. Stuff the outer 
parts of the onions with this, lay in a baking dish, spread 
over the top -any stuffing you have left, and pour around the 
onions one cup of sweet milk. Then bake slowly one-half 
hour. 

BOILED PARSNIPS 

Select medium-sized parsnips. Scrape and lay them in 
cold water for half an hour. At the end of that time, pour off 
the water. Put them in a saucepan. Cover with boiling water, 
slightly salted. Keep covered with water while boiling, and 
add more water when needed. Boil the parsnips very tender, 
which will take one hour or more. When done, lay in a hot 
dish. If they are large, split them lengthwise. One way 
of dressing parsnips is to sprinkle each parsnip separately 
with salt and pepper, and pour over a quantity of melted 
butter. Another is to sprinkle them with pepper, and pour 
over drawn butter, which is made as follows: One heaping 
tablespoon and a half of butter, one heaping tablespoon and 
a half of fiour mashed together in a small saucepan. Pour 
over one teacup and a half of hot water and stir to dissolve. 
Salt to taste. Set this saucepan in another containing water. 
Let the mixture come to boil. Stir constantly until it thick- 
ens, keep very smooth, and have just thick enough to pour 
easily. Pour over the parsnips, and serve. 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 191 

FRIED PARSNIPS 

Split and scrape parsnips. Lay them in cold water for 
half an hour. Put in £i saucepan of boiling water, and boil 
until tender. When done, drain. Roll crackers very fine, and 
season with red pepper and salt. Beat one egg with one 
tablespoon of water. Dip the parsnip in the egg, and roll in 
the cracker. Fry them a light brown and serve in a hot dish. 

SCALLOPED PARSNIPS 

Wash and scrape the parsnips and cut them the long way 
in halves. Have enough boiling water to cover and boil 
gently about forty-five minutes, till tender. Drain and cut 
each half into small pieces. In a baking dish put a layer of 
the cut parsnips with a seasoning of salt and minced onion. 
Over this a thin layer of breadcrumbs, well spread with but- 
ter. Repeat the parsnips and then the breadcrumbs. Have 
the top layer of the crumbs. Pour over the dish milk cooked 
to a creamy thickness with flour. Let the milk rise almost to 
the top of the scallop, set in a moderate oven and bake twenty 
minutes to half an hour. 

STUFFED PEPPERS 

Take six or seven good-sized peppers, remove the seeds 
and inner pith, and set over the fire in boiling water for fifteen 
minutes. Pour two tablespoons of melted butter over a cup 
of fine breadcrumbs. Add an egg and half a teaspoon of 
salt, mix thoroughly, and lastly add a cup of chopped cold 
meat softened with stock or water. Mix all again, stuff the 
forcemeat into the hollow peppers, set in a pan with a little 
hot water, and bake in a moderate oven till the .peppers are 
thoroughly cooked through — allowing an hour for the baking. 

SWEET PEPPERS WITH RICE 

A NEW ORLEANS RECEIPT 

Boil four large peppers until they are tender and can be 
easily pierced with a fork, then remove the stems and seed. 



192 THE HOME COOK BOOR 

Into a deep hot saucepan put one teacup of beef dripping. 
When this is at boiling point add one large cup of minced 
small green onions. Brown thoroughly, and add one teacup 
of canned tomatoes. Cook three minutes, stirring constantly 
to keep from burning. Add a good pinch of thyme, two 
minced garlic cloves, a good pinch of red pepper, and salt 
to taste. When browned, add two teacups of cold boiled rice. 
Brown the whole, moistening with cold soup stock or any 
gravies you may have left over. Cook slowly for five minutes. 
Stuff the peppers with this rice mixture. Be careful not to 
break them. Lay them in a shallow pan and bake for ten 
minutes in a moderate heat. Serve hot. 

SALSIFY OR OYSTER-PLANT 

Scrape the roots and throw each one into cold water as 
you scrape, or it will turn black. Put into a saucepan, cover 
with boiling water and stew about three-quarters of an hour 
until tender. When done, turn off nearly all the water and 
add enough milk to cover. Thicken with one tablespoon of 
butter and one tablespoon of flour stirred together, and put 
in the milk after it has boiled ten minutes. Boil gently until 
the milk thickens. 

MOCK OYSTERS 

Scrape salsify roots and throw each one as you scrape it 
into cold water. Cover with boiling water and boil gently 
three-quarters of an hour. They will then be tender. Mash 
the roots and put through a colander. Then season with 
salt and pepper to taste and stir in beaten eggs, allowing one 
egg to two heaping tablespoons of the salsify pulp. Have on 
a griddle or in a saucepan hot fat. Drop the mixture from 
a spoon and fry. When one side is brown turn the salisfy 
pake and brown on the other side. Serve hot. 

TO BOIL SPINACH 

Spinach is a most wholesome vegetable, carrying of all 
vegetables the greatest amount of iron, and it is a pity it is not 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 198 

more commonly eaten by Americans. It gains in taste by a 
little added care. 

Wash the spinach thoroughly and put it in a pot of boiling 
salted water. A pinch of soda is sometimes added to keep 
the spinach green. Let it boil from twenty to thirty minutes. 
When tender pour in a colander or sieve and drain. After 
the water is out, serve ; or see next receipt. 

FRENCHED SPINACH 

Proceed exactly as Ae foregoing receipt directs. After 
your spinach has drained, put it in a bowl and chop it fine. 
Next put in a saucepan, add butter and a dash of pepper, 
and serve smoking hot as a vegetable. 

SPINACH WITH EGGS ON TOAST • 

Proceed exactly as in the two foregoing receipts, except 
the serving. Have ready thin slices of buttered toast and 
lay a spoonful of spinach on each slice. Upon each spoonful 
of spinach slip an egg which has been poached. Or if hard- 
boiled eggs are preferred, halve the eggs and push the halves 
in the spinach, leaving the gold and white side uppermost, 
and dusting the whole with pepper. 

SPINACH MOUSSE 

Put half a peck of well- washed spinach in a saucepan of 
boiling water. Add half a tablespoon of salt, and cook three 
minutes from the time it begins to boil. Remove, drain, and 
chop the spinach fine, then weigh it. There should be two 
poimds. Melt two tablespoons of butter, add one heaping, 
tablespoon of flour, stir and cook two minutes. Add one cup 
oi milk, and cook to a thick, smooth sauce. Remove from 
the fire, pour the sauce into the spinach and add four well- 
beaten eggs. Season with salt and pepper, mix all well to- 
gether, pack the spinach in a well-buttered melon mold ; place 
llris in a steamer and cook for one hour. Shortly before 

serving, turn the mousse on to a warm dish. Rub the yolks

194 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

of two hard-boiled eggs through a sieve and decorate the top 
of the spinach with it. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs cut in 
half. [See illustration, Plate XX.] 

TO COOK SQUASH 

The small crookneck summer squash is the best. All 
kinds are cooked the same way. Cut the squash apart and 
take out the seeds. The crookneck does not require peeling. 
Lay the pieces in cold water. Squash is best steamed. Set 
the steamer over a kettle of boiling water. Cook until tender, 
which will be from one-half to three-quarters of an hour for 
the softer squashes. When done, put in a saucepan, mash 
fine and smooth, add butter, salt and pepper to taste, and 
serve very hot. 

BAKED SQUASH 

Cut a winter squash in two down its length. Take out 
the seeds and filaments and set the halves in a dripping-pan. 
Put water in the pan and cover the squash, and in a moderate 
oven bake from an hour and a half to two hours. A quarter of 
an hour before the squash is done take from the oven, empty 
the water from the pan, and sprinkle salt and spread butter 
round the upper or pulp portion of the two halves. Set back 
in the oven to brown, and serve, setting the halves on a platter 
and dipping the squash from its own shell. 

SQUASH IN THE SHELL 

Select a well-shaped cymling, cut a thick slice from the 
stem end and scoop out seeds and fibre. Fill up with force- 
meat and breadcrumbs highly seasoned. Stand in a shallow 
baking-pan in a larger pan of boiling water. Bake four or 
five hours. Garnish with fried sausages. [See illustration, 
Plate XX.] 

SQUASH CAKES 

This is an excellent way to utilize squash left from a meal. 
Put it through a colander or sieve. Mix in half as much fine 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 195 

bread rolled or crumbed as you have squash. Season to your 
taste with salt, pepper, butter and a dash of onion-juice. It 
is a good proportion to allow about a tablespoon of butter 
to two cups of the mashed squash. Mix all together and 
form into cakes or croquettes. Have upon a plate a raw egg, 
or the white of an egg whipped with a tablespoon of cold 
water. Also have rolled cracker or bread crumbs. Dip the 
squash cakes in the egg, then in the crumbs, and fry in hot 
fat until brown. 

RAW TOMATOES 

Take firm, ripe, good-sized tomatoes. Have a pan in 
which is boiling water. Put a fork into the tomato, turn it 
over and over a moment in the boiling water. With a small 
sharp knife peel off the skin. Scoop out die piece above 
the core, and cut off any rough pieces, so that the tomato 
may be smooth. Continue to peel one at a time until you 
have the number required. Lay on an earthen plate, and set on 
the ice in the morning. By evening they will be firm and 
refreshing. Serve whole, with French dressing. If you pre- 
fer them sliced, cut them half an hour before the meal, and 
cut thin strips of green pepper and lay between them. The 
flavor is very nice. 

BAKED RIPE TOMATOES 

Select good-sized, smooth tomatoes. Wash in cold water, 
and wipe dry. Cut out the core, and any rough places on top 
and lay in a pudding dish. In place of the core, put quite a 
teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of sugar, nearly a teaspoon of 
butter, and pepper to taste. A large tomato would require 
a heaping teaspoon of sugar. Fill the space between the toma- 
toes with breadcrumbs. Sprinkle over them salt and pepper. 
Set the dish in a moderately hot oven. Put a pan of water in 
the oven above it. Bake steadily one hour and a quarter. 
When done (and do not let them bum at all), set them aside 
to cool a short time before putting on the table. 



196 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BAKED RIPE TOMATOES WITH CORN 

Select smooth, fine, large tomatoes. Wash them in cold 
water, and wipe dry. Take out the cores. Sprinkle bread- 
crumbs in the bottom of a shallow pudding dish, and season 
them with pepper and salt. Put the tomatoes in the pud- 
ding dish. Have ready very fine sweet sugar corn, cut care- 
fully from the cob, and scrape the pulp off with the back of 
a knife. Season this corn with salt, a little red pepper, and 
sugar to taste. Stuff the cored tomatoes with the com. Put 
a large piece of butter on top of each tomato, and over this 
some fine breadcrumbs. Season with a little salt and pepper. 
Bake in a moderately hot oven, with a pan of warm water in 
the oven above. Bake steadily one hour and a quarter. Let 
cool a short time before serving. 

BOILED TOMATOES 

Choose smooth tomatoes of nearly the same size. Drop 
into salted boiling water and boil until you can easily pierce 
them with a fork. Lift and put on hot buttered toast. Score 
the top of each, place on it a little ball of butter mixed with 
salt, a trifle of sugar and pepper if you like, and serve at once 
and hot. 

FRIED TOMATOES 

Choose firm tomatoes, not too ripe. Wash in cold water 
and wipe dry. Cut in two halves. Season them separately 
and highly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle half a teaspoon of 
sugar over each piece. Have a frying-pan with some hot lard 
and butter. Lay the tomatoes in it and cook slowly until done, 
which will be nearly one hour. Take up with a cake turner, 
lay on a hot platter, pour over them melted butter, and serve. 

FRIED GREEN TOMATOES WITH HAM 

Cut green tomatoes in halves if they are small ones; 
if large, cut in four pieces. Dredge the pieces lightly 
with flour and fry in drippings in a saucepan. Lay on a 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 197 

hot platter round broiled ham or broiled bacon. Make a 
sauce or gravy by pouring off nearly all the fat of the drip- 
pings, and then pouring into the saucepan half or three-quar- 
ters of a cup of milk. Let boil up and pour over the tomatoes.^ 

« 

STEWED TOMATOES 

Take fine red tomatoes all of a size and pour over them 
boiling water to loosen their skins. Slip off the skins and 
lay the tomatoes in a dish with a little butter, salt, and pepper 
sprinkled over them. Set them in the oven and cook fifteen 
minutes. Then turn the tomatoes, add a little more butter, a 
dredging of flour, a small cup of milk to seven or eight toma- 
toes, and cook slowly till the tomatoes are done. The later 
cooking may be either in the oven or on the back of the stove. 

CANNED STEWED TOMATOES 

Pour the contents of a quart can of tomatoes in a saunce- 
pan. Season with one full teaspoon of salt, one full teaspoon 
of sugar, and two dashes of pepper. Tomatoes vary as to 
acid. Taste as you season. They must not be at all sweet, 
merely a blending of all three seasonings. They require 
enough salt for a lively flavor, just enough pepper to taste 
after waiting a second, the right flavor not coming at once. 
Add one large tablespoon of butter. Set the saucepan on a 
cooler part of the stove, where in boiling the tomatoes will not 
stick to the bottom. Boil steadily, and slowly, half an hour, 
uncovered, stirring and watching carefully. At the end of 
that time put the saucepan in another with hot water in it. 
Add two slices of stale bread crust broken in coarse pieces. 
Stir in. Cover, and cook steadily again for another half hour. 
If not ready to serve, more cooking will do no harm. After 
setting them in the hot water, no more watching will be 
needed. Tomatoes require very thorough cooking to be per- 
fect. If there are any left for next day, add a little water, if 
too thick, and heat, standing in the water. They are quite as 
good as when fresh cooked. 



198 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

STUFFED TOMATOES 

A NEW ORLEANS DISH 

Select large, round, firm tomatoes. From four of these 
remove the hearts, taking care not to break the shells or skins. 
Have a tablespoon of boiling butter in a saucepan and to this 
add one minced onion and the minced hearts of the tomatoes 
Add one teacup of minced cold meat, also one cup of cracker 
crumbs. Brown these well, seasoning with minced garlic, a 
teaspoon of minced parsley, a pinch of thyme and rosemarjr, 
half a teaspoon of salt and some red pepper. When browned, 
stir into it two raw eggs. Stuif the tomatoes, lay them in a 
shallow baking dish, pour round them some canned tomato- 
juice, and bake one-half hour in a moderate oven. 

DICED TURNIPS 

Cut the turnips before cooking into dice, or with a vege- 
table scoop into little balls the size of a small marble. Boil 
till tender. Serve hot in a dish after pouring over the dice 
or balls melted butter seasoned with paprika or cayenne and 
chopped parsley. 

MASHED TURNIPS 

Pare carefully from the turnips the thick, hard rind, cut 
them in halves or quarters, put in boiling water and cook 
till tender. Allow fifteen or twenty minutes longer than for 
boiling potatoes. When they are done pour off and press out 
the water, using a large plate for pressing them. Mash them 
as you mash potatoes, and to make sure they are free from 
lumps mash them in a colander or sieve, pressing them through 
with the masher. Put in a saucepan, set over the fire and 
stir constantly for some minutes, adding salt and butter. 
Serve in a vegetable dish, dust over them pepper and drop on 
pieces of butter the size of acorns. 

STEAMED TURNIPS 

Select medium-sized turnips. Slice across the turnip, in 
slices not quite three-quarters of an inch thick. Wash in 



VEGETABLES— MISCELLANEOUS 199 

cold water, lay in a steamer, and set over a pot of boiling 
water. Put the lid on, and set a weight or flatiron on top 
to keep it firmly covered, and keep the water boiling hard. 
Boil until the turnips are tender, which will be in about two 
hours. Have ready three tablespoons of melted butter. Take 
out half of the turnips and lay them in a vegetable dish. 
Sprinkle them with a good deal of salt and pepper, and pour 
over them half of the melted butter. Now put the remainder 
of the turnips in the dish, and proceed as before, pouring 
the other half of the butter over them. This done, take a 
silver fork and lightly turn them over, to mix the butter 
through them.

BAKED MACARONI 

BOIL quarter of a pound of macaroni until tender. When 
done, put it in a colander and drain. Have ready a shallow 
pudding dish buttered. Put a layer of macaroni in the bottom 
of the dish. Sprinkle over it salt, a little red pepper carefully, 
one tablespoon of melted butter, one iron spoon of tomatoes 
stewed and seasoned, one iron spoon of cream, and one table- 
spoon of grated cheese. Prepare the second layer in the same 
way. When done, turn this over lightly with a fork to mix 
well. In a separate dish season some of the boiled macaroni 
with salt, white pepper, one teaspoon of melted butter, and 
one teaspoon of grated cheese. Mix. Spread this over the 
top of the first dish of macaroni. Brown lightly in an upper 
oven. 

BOILED MACARONI 

Select the best macaroni, in which there is great choice, 
some being very tough. Have ready a large tin saucepan, as 
it requires a great deal of water and a very hard boiling, which 
granite will not give. Fill the pot three-quarters full of water. 
Break the macaroni into pieces two inches long. It will re- 
quire twenty-two sticks of the macaroni for a large vegetable 
dish. Have the water boiling hard, and drop it in, a little at 
a time, and add a teaspoon of salt. With a large meat fork, 
move it now and then so it will not stick to the bottom. Add 
hot water as the water boils away, and keep plenty over the 
macaroni until done. It is not done until perfectly tender. 



MACARONI., RICE, FRITTERS 201 

which will be one hour or one hour and a quarter. When done, 
pour it into a colander and drain off the water. Have ready 
in a tin cup two or three tablespoons of melted butter. Put 
half the macaroni into a hot vegetable dish, sprinkle a good 
deal of salt, a very little red pepper, a quarter of a teaspoon 
of dry mustard, a heaping tablespoon of grated cheese, and 
part of the melted butter. Now, add the rest of the macaroni 
the same as before. Put over the seasoning, and when done 
turn it over twice with a silver fork, so that the butter is well 
through it. Serve very hot. 

MACARONI WITH HAM 

Mince fine a slice of raw ham, add a minced onion, and 
brown all together in a saucepan. Moisten the ham with 
tomato sauce, lay it over half a pound of macaroni which you 
have cooked in boiling water. Sprinkle with four or five 
teaspoons of grated cheese and serve. 

TO COOK RICE 

EAST INDIA RECEIPT 

Wash thoroughly a cup and a half of the best rice. Set 
over the fire a pot holding four quarts of cold water. Put in 
the rice and bring to boil and keep boiling until you can mash 
the rice kernels between thumb and finger. Salt five minutes 
before this point is reached. Take off the pot, throw in it a 
quart of cold water, tip the rice on a sieve or colander to drain 
thoroughly, set in the oven to dry out, and serve hot. Each 
kernel will be separate and flaky when cooked in this way. 

RICE CROQUETTES 

Wash one teacup of rice in cold water. Pour it in a double- 
boiler, and pour over it a little more than one quart of hot 
water. Add one heaping teaspoon of salt. Boil until very 
soft. When done, which will be one hour or more, take out 
the rice, put it in a pudding dish, and cover while hot to 
prevent its becoming hard on top. It is better to cook this the

EGG AS A BEVERAGE 

Beat one egg very light, not separating the yolk and white. 
Add two or three tablespoons of rich milk, a little nutmeg 
if preferred, and one tablespoon of sherry wine, or whiskey, 
but preferably no flavoring at all. There is said to be as much 
nourishment in one egg taken in this way as there is in one 
pound of beef. 

EGG COCKTAIL 

Make each cocktail separately. Use a few drops of wine 
or cider vinegar, a tablespoon of lemon- juice, a pinch of horse- 
radish, and a teaspoon of tomato ketchup, mixing all. together- 
Beat a perfectly fresh egg and pour it over the mixture. Two 
or three drops of Tabasco sauce may be added, but it is best 
not to drive the appetite. 

EGG CROQUETTES 

Boil four eggs till they are perfectly hard. Then rub 
through a fine sieve, add three tablespoons of cream, a da^ 
of pepper, a saltspoon of salt, and stir well all together. Add 
also a teaspoon of butter. Stir thoroughly and thicken wi1& 
pulverized cracker stiff enough to form into balls. Make up 
in little balls, roll each ball in cracker dust and drop into deep, 
hot fat. When the croquettes are brown, take out with a per- 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 205 

forated or wire spoon and drain. Serve with crisp, hot bacon,, 
or cold with a lettuce salad. 

CURRIED EGGS 

Wet two large spoons of flour with half a cup of milk 
which you take f^;om a scant quart. Add half a teaspoon of 
salt and mix in two teaspoons of curry powder. Put the rest 
of the scant quart of milk in a flat saucepan over a moderate 
fire. When it becomes hot stir in your flour and curry mix- 
ture and cook till the milk thickens. Carefully break half a 
dozen eggs so that neither yolk nor white is broken — ^to break 
them into a saucer is the surest way. Slip the broken eggs 
into the bubbling milk and let them cook till the white sets. 
It will take two and a half or three minutes. Carefully remove 
the eggs with a large spoon or ladle, lay each egg on a piece 
of golden brown toast, just toasted, pour over the toast enough 
of the curried milk to soften the toast, #id serve at once. 

FRIED EGGS 

Eggs fried in lard are more delicate than those fried in 
bacon fat. Put just enough lard in a granite frying-pan to 
keep Ae eggs from sticking. Break the eggs in a saucer, 
sprinkle a little salt over each one separately, and when the 
lard is hot pour them in to cook. Cook slowly over a moderate 
fire. They should be white on the underside, and not brown, 
when done. If preferred folded, use a broad knife, and fold 
them over from both sides when half set, holding with the 
knife a second to prevent their turning back. Sprinkle no 
pq)per over them. Serve on a hot platter. 

EGGS AND ONIONS 

Boil six eggs for twenty minutes, then drop in cold water. 
When cool enough to handle, peel, and slice four and the 
whites of the other two. Set to fry in a tablespoon of butter 
or drippings six white onions of average size, sliced. Let 
the onions fry slowly, keeping in their steam with a tight cover. 



206 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

When they are browned, salt, and put on a flat hot dish. Lay 
the sliced eggs over them. Mix the two hard-boiled yolks you 
reserved, mashing with three tablespoons of cream. Mix 
slowly. Boil up the cream, add a dash of cayenne, pour over 
the onions and eggs, and serve. 

EGGS AS PANCAKES 

Have the griddle used in cooking pancakes and flapjacks 
heated to a smooth, gentle heat. Rub it with a swab of suet 
fat or of salt pork, and slip from a saucer one by one the eggs 
you wish to cook. When the whites of the eggs cook to a 
golden brown underneath, turn them with a broad knife or 
pancake turner, and let the white brown on the other side. 
Sprinkle with salt and serve on a hot dish. 

Muffin rings may be oiled and set on the griddle, and the 
eggs dropped within them are kept from spreading. 

PICKLED EGGS 

First boil the eggs half an hour. Drop them in cold water 
to cool, remove the shells and put the eggs in an earthen or 
glass jar. Cover them with hot vinegar. Or if you wish to 
give them a spiced flavor pour over them vinegar in which 
peppers, allspice, cardamom seeds, and cloves have been boiled. 
But the plain pickled eggs are to most tastes the best. Let 
them stand twenty-four hours before serving. 

• POACHED EGGS 

Cook in a utensil that comes for poaching eggs (which keep 
the shape better), or in a granite saucepan. Break the eggs, 
one at a time, in a small saucer, and slip them carefully into 
the poacher. Then set the poacher in a pan of salted water 
which has come to boil. Boil gently until the eggs are set, 
which will be about three minutes. 

If you poach in a saucepan, salt the water, let it boil, and 
keep it hot. Break the eggs in a saucer, and slip them care- 
fully in the water. Then set the saucepan forward, and boil 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 207 

gently until done. Take the eggs out with a perforated ladle. 
Hafve ready toast that has been browned, buttered, and cov- 
ered for ar short time with a pan so that it will be moist. Lay 



^ 




A Perforated Ladle 



each egg on a slice of toast. Pour melted butter over the 
eggs. Serve on separate plates, or all on one dish, very hot. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

Beat six eggs very light. When beaten add about one- 
quarter of an even teaspoon of salt and one-third of a cup 
of sweet milk. Stir together. Melt butter enough in a granite 
saucepan to prevent the egg sticking. When hot pour in the 
eggs. When they are set about the edge and begin to cook, 
take an iron spoon (it requires a large spoon), slip it under 
and pile up the egg toward the middle. Never stir the eggs, 
and break them as little as possible. Cook to look soft on the 
top, and cook over a very moderate fire. When done, slip 
a cake turner under the eggs, and slide them into a hot vege- 
table dish. Serve hot and immediately, as they become heavy 
by standing. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CHEESE 

The mixture for scrambling is made by allowing to one 
^SS one tablespoon of milk and one tablespoon of grated 
cheese. Salt and pepper, to taste. Beat the eggs, add the 
other ingredients and scramble quickly in a hot saucepan. Do 
not cook until hard and dry, but take from the fire while still 
soft and serve in a hot dish. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS AND DRIED BEEF 

See that the beef is broken or cut in small pieces. Freshen 
it by letting it stand in boiling hot water a minute. Take 



208 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

about a quarter of a pound of the meat. Beat slightly four 
eggs, add quarter of a cup of milk and tip in the dried beef 
from which you have pressed the water. In a saucepan melt 
a couple of tablespoons of butter ; when the butter is hot put in 
the eggs and meat, stir lightly, and keep the eggs from stick- 
ing to the saucepan. Do not cook till the eggs are hard and 
dry, but take from the fire while soft and serve at once in a 
hot dish. 

STUFFED EGGS 

Boil six eggs hard. Some hours after, when cold, cut them 
neatly in half and take out the yolks. Cut a small piece from 
the bottom of the whites so they will stand. Put the yolks in 
an earthenware dish or bowl, mash and make them into a stiff 
paste, seasoning with salt, a little red pepper, a pinch of mus- 
tard, a little sugar, vinegar, cream, and olive oil, being careful 
not to add too much vinegar. No rule as to quantity can be 
given, as the size of eggs varies. The seasoning must be guided 
by the taste. Fill the whites and pile on top. These are nice 
as a relish and very good laid on two or three crisp lettuce 
leaves which have been moistened with French dressing. 

SWISS EGGS 

Rub butter over the bottom of an earthen baking dish or 
plate and lay in the dish as many thin slices of cheese as you 
use eggs, upon each slice of cheese placing an egg which you 
have broken as if for poaching. Sprinkle the eggs with a 
seasoning of salt and pepper ; then sprinkle with grated cheese, 
and bake till the whites are set. 

WHIRLED EGGS 

Have crisp, buttered toast, brown and hot. Have also a 
quart of salted boiling water in a deep saucepan or kettle. 
Have the water boiling hard. Stir it one way round and round 
with a large spoon till it whirls rapidly. One by one break 
eggs in a cup and drop in the centre of the whirling water. 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 209 

Keep the water whirling' and the egg will roll up in a round 
ball. Take the egg from the water with a perforated spoon 
or ladle and lay on a piece of toast. Salt, pepper, and serve 
hot. 

TO MAKE OMELETS 

Use an iron, not a tin or earthen saucepan, and have it 
scoured perfectly clean and smooth. Break in a bowl four 
eggs and beat them not more than fifteen beats, but these 
give with vigor. If you beat the eggs too much and have 
too many air cells, the air expands in the saucepan and con- 
tracts when the eggs are put on a cooler plate, and so the 
omelet is heavy. To the four eggs beaten fifteen strot^ 
strokes add lightly a tablespoon of hot water to each egg — 
four tablespoons of hot water. In the iron saucepan put a 
piece of butter as large as the yolk of an egg. In the four 
eggs drop a piece half as large. As soon as the butter in the 
saucepan melts and is hot pour in the eggs. Set over a hot 
fire and as the eggs stiffen slip carefully under them a thin 
pliable knife so that the liquid egg on top will run under and 
form another layer of set eggs. Sprinkle over all about half 
a teaspoon of salt and a dash of pepper, and if there is any 
more liquid egg lift again, let it run down to the hot 
saucepan and set. When the egg is set, cooked, but not hard 
and not brown, put your knife under the part of the omelet 
nearest you, and roll it over on the part furthest from you. 
Have ready a hot plate, slip the omelet on the plate and serve 
at once. Omelets should not stand, but should be eaten at 
once; they should not be cooked till those to eat them are 
ready. 

Milk toughens omelets. Salt, except at the last, or flour 
for stiffening also toughens omelets. 

SWEET OMELETS 

Beat six eggs according to the foregoing directions "To 
Make Omelets." Have an omelet or frying pan hot, and melt 



210 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

in it a tablespoon of butter. Pour in your mixture. Do not 
stir or shake the pan till the omelet sets. To keep it from 
scorching take a long-bladed knife and slip under the omelet 
and loosen it from the pan. Allow five minutes for its 
cooking. Take it from the fire, spread over it preserved 
plums, peaches, cherries, or tart apples, or whatever fruit 
you choose, fold it over once in the form of a turnover, slip 
it on a hot platter, sift over it a little fine sugar and serve at 
once. An omelet becomes heavy if it stands. 

CORN OMELET 

A tasty omelet is made by using the two or three ears 
of green com left from the dinner the day before. Cut the 
upper part of the kernels from the cob, set to warm, and when 
your omelet is done fold in the hot com. In making, use 
the receipt for a plain omelet. 

JELLY OMELETS 

Omelets spread with jelly, such as crab-apple jelly, currant 
jelly, grape jelly, are all alike tasty and wholesome. 

MEAT OMELETS 

Chicken omelets are made by spreading minced chicken 
upon the lower half of the omelet before folding over. 
Tongue omelets, ham omelets, and oyster omelets are also 
prepared in the same way. 

OMELET WITH PEAS 

Beat the yolks of two eggs lightly, add two tablespoons 
of cold water, fold in the whites, beaten dry, turn into a small 
omelet pan slightly greased with olive oil, and stand over the 
fire till set. Then dry in the oven, dust with salt, fold and 
turn out on a hot platter. Garnish with a rim of stewed peas. 
Do not overcook the omelet. The centre should be soft and 
creamy. 



EGGS, OMELETS, CHEESE, RAREBITS 211 

SPANISH OMELET 

Add a little fine-chopped onion, or onion- juice, to a plain 
omelet — ^allowing four or five drops of juice to an egg. 

TOMATO OMELET 

Make a plain omelet, and just before folding over spread 
hot cooked ton^toes on the lower half. Fold, pour hot 
tomatoes round the omelet and serve at once. If this dish is 
made for an invalid the tomatoes should be put through a 
colander or sieve, and freed from seeds. 

COTTAGE CREAM CHEESE 

Having first skimmed the milk, set it in its pan upon the 
back of the stove, or over a kettle of boiling water. Stir the 
milk gently while it is getting hot. When the whey is too 
hot to hold the finger in — as it heats the curd and whey 
separate— pour into a cheesecloth bag or a strainer and let it 
drip till the curd is drained. Put the curd into a bowl and 
season with salt aod cream, giving one teaspoon ol^alt and a 
small teacup of cream to a milk pan of milk, and stirring well. 
This cream cheese is prettily served piled high in a dark blue 
or green bowl, or in glass. 

POT OR DUTCH CHEESE 

Put a panful of loppered milk on a slow fire, or over a 
kettle of hot water. Heat slowly, until the curd and whey 
separate. Stir, and do not scald or the curd will become 
tough. When the curd and whey entirely separate, pour into 
a cheesecloth bag and drain. Stir into the curd enough but- 
ter, sweet cream, and salt to make it moist. Add pepper, if 
you like, then mound on lettuce leaves, or make into tiny soft 
balls not much larger than an English walnut. 

FONDUE 

Mix together seven ounces of cheese cut fine, two ounces 
of rolled cracker or bread crumbs, and two ounces of softened 



212 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

butter. Pour over this one pint of ?weet milk, which has come 
to boil, and stir. Next, add the yolks of three beaten eggs 
and a little salt. Keep warm until all is dissolved, then add 
the whites of the eggs, which have been beaten to a stiff froth. 
Stir in lightly with a silver fork. Grease a pudding dish, 
pour the mixture into this, and bake twenty minutes in an 
upper oven, as the lower one melts the cheese. Serve hot as 
soon as done. 

WELSH RAREBIT 

Into a saucepan or chafing dish put one tablespoon of 
butter, half a teaspoon of dry mustard, quarter of a teaspoon 
of cayenne, and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Melt 
and stir, and then add a small cup (one gill) of milk. When 
well blended, stir in a pound of soft American cheese which 
has been grated or cut in small dice. Let the cheese melt, 
stir all the time and blend well, and then pour over small 
pieces of golden brown toast, and serve at once. If the cheese 
should by^ome quality thicken too much, add a little more 
milk. Beer may be used in place of milk, but milk is here 
recommended. 

PLAIN WELSH RAREBIT 



To one large cup of finely grated cheese, add one well- 
beaten egg and enough milk to make the three a cream. If 
you like any other seasoning, add it. Pour into a saucepan, 
let it boil up once and then pour over hot buttered toast. 

WELSH RAREBIT FOR SUNDAY SUPPER

well beaten. Stir all thoroughly. Have crisp, hot toast, cut in 
triangles or fingers. Spread the cheese mixture over the 
toast, and serve at once.

THE SCIENCE OF SANDWICH-MAKING 

THE old-fashioned sandwich — ^two thick wedges of bread, 
erratically buttered, hard of crust, exuding mustard, and 
with frills of ham or corned beef about the edge — has been rele- 
gated to the past by the arrival of the meat-chopper. The 
only places where it seems to linger is at railroad lunch coun- 
ters ; occasionally, too, it reappears at a Sunday-school picnic. 
The sandwiches of the past were of half a dozen varieties, the 
filling of a modern sandwich is limited only by what you have 
on hand. Fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables, eggs, nuts, fruit, cheese, 
and pickles may be utilized alone, or combined, and the result, 
when prepared by a skilful cook, is a dainty and delicious 
morsel. 

The first subject, when one takes up sandwich-making, is 
bread. If many sandwiches are required, as for a reception 
or picnic, I prefer to bake the bread specially for them ; there 
is less waste and the work is so much easier. For this pur- 
pose I keep on hand plenty of baking powder cans, one-pound 
and half-pound sizes, and also a few oblong tins which have 
held one pound of cocoa. Nothing can excel these as molds 
for baking bread for picnic sandwiches; it is tender, almost 
crustless, it needs no trimming to make two slices accord in 
size and it bakes or steams much more quickly than in larger 
tins. 

Make the bread twenty-four hours before it is required 
and try to have it fine-grained. Fill the cans half full of dough 



SANDWICHES 215 

and set to rise. When almost at the top of the tins put to 
bake with the lids off. When you have brown bread mixture, 
fill three-quarters full — it does not rise so much as bread which 
has yeast in it. Slip the small loaves out of the tins as soon 
as taken from the oven or steamer and set on a wire stand to 
cool; then wrap in towels and put away in the bread-box 
until required. 

The next consideration is the butter. Put a pound of 
butter (if you have many sandwiches to make) in a mixing 
bowl and with a slitted wooden spoon beat it thoroughly to 
a fine, light cream, exactly as for cake making. The butter 
is much easier to spread, it is more economical, then it is ready 
to divide into portions and blend with anything to make what 
is called a flavored butter, the most delicate of all fillings. 

Before preparing the sandwiches, if they are to be used at 
a luncheon or entertainment where other dishes accompany 




A Slitted Wooden Spoon 

them, be careful that the flavoring is different from the salad 
with which they are served. It is really in better taste to offer 
nothing with a salad or cold meat except plain sandwiches of 
bread and butter; still, fashion seems to demand a flavored 
nibble as a salad accompaniment. Fish, lobster, or shrimp 
salads are most appetizing with sandwiches of Boston brown 
bread holding a tender lettuce-leaf or a sprig of watercress 
dipped in mayonnaise. Serve sandwiches of mild cheese 
flavored by mustard or vinegar with green salads. White 
bread sandwiches holding tender young nasturtium leaves be- 
tween the buttered folds go well with salads of meat or fish. 
Garnish a plateful of this variety with a few nasturtium leaves 
and blossoms. Finely cut peppergrass, chives, endive, or 
celery are all fitting accompaniments to sandwiches, which 
are offered with a^meat or chicken salad. Cucumbers and to- 



216 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

matoes thinly sliced and spread widi mayonnaise make a 
delicious bite between buttered bread. Cut with a small cookie 
cutter rounds of bread, slightly larger than the slisiie of tomato 
or cucumber, and pot the vegetable between them. These, as 
well as tile herb sandwiches, must not be made until imme- 
diately before serving. 

Cheese, which is generally the first course in a sandwich 
menu, may be spread between folds of white, graham, or en- 
tire wheat bread or delicate crackers. Roquefort, fromage de 
Brie, or any of the stronger cheeses, may be flavored with 
finely chopped chives or parsley and creamed butter. Combine 
with a milder cheese, chopped olives, walnut meats, anchovy 
essence and a dash of mustard, paprika, and salt. Grate hard 
cheese and mash soft cheese with a spoon, afterward rub to a 
paste witii mayonnaise or butter and flavoring. The delicious 
little cream or Neufchatel cheeses may be blended with 
chopped walnuts, g^ven a bit of seasoning by Parmesan cheese, 
also a hint of lemon-juice and paprika. 

Under the head of sandwiches is a long list of possibilities. 
They include meat, fish, egg, as well as fillings obtained from 
chopped olives and pickles, or some strong seasoning, curry, 
caviare, or anchovy. For all sorts of meat use a chopper, grind- 
ing with the finest knife. It provides a paste which, blended 
with ma3^nnaise, is as easy to spread on bread as butter. 
Scores of receipts might be offered to direct this blending^ 
process, but the clever cook, with her own palate as criterion, 
can easily adapt a few suggestions to the materials on hand. 
Chicken combines well with celery, chopped nuts, and ofives* 
The most delicate chicken sandwich I know is seasoned widr 
celery salt and moistened with thick whipped cream instead of 
mayonnaise. Ham paste is blended with mayonnaise, mustard, 
chopped olives, and gherkins. Veal paste may be seasoned 
like chicken — ^indeed one can scarcely tell the difference be- 
tween the two fillings. Roast beef, corned beef, lamb, and 
poultry paste make good sandwiches. If you have not enough 
of one meat add to it another which harmonizes in flavor ; for 
instance, veal goes well with any sort of poultry, while toogixe 



SANDWICHES 217 

and ham make a good mixtizre. If remains of roast beef, lamb, 
or corned beef are small, dbop and blend each separately; 
nothing seems to assimilate well with red-blooded meats. Use 
mustard, a few drops of onion extract, and chopped pickles as 
flavoring. They are better moistened with creamed butter 
than with mayonnaise. Put lobster, shrimp, or crab meat 
through the chopper. G>ld fidi (»* canned salmon is better 
delicately picked to flakes with a fork. Sardines, anchovies, 
and salt fish make tasty picnic sandwiches. Potmd them to a 
paste and give a touch of acidity by lemon- juice or chopped 
pickle. Eggs should be hard-boiled; allow to become thor- 
oughly cold, then put through a chopper, mix with mayonnaise 
or butter and season well. 

Then one comes to sweet sandwiches — the variety is almost 
unlimited. Figs, dates, prunes, raisins, nuts, preserved ginger. 







Fancy Sondwich-Cutten 

and candied peel are some of the fruits which may be chopped, 
sweetened, moistened with whipped cream, lemon, orange, or 
pineapple juice and spread between folds of white bread. 
When preparing them for an entertainment, cut heart, dia- 
mond, or club shaped, and on top of each lay something which 
suggests the filling — an English walnut meat, a shred of green 
citron peel, or half a maraschino cherry, dipped in icing to 
make them stick. When you wish to roll sandwiches, use 
fresh bread, spread very lightly with the filling and pin into 
shape with a fine toothpick. 

It is quite easy to keep sandwiches fresh some hours be- 
fore they are required. Wring a napkin as dry as possible 
from hot water — a good plan is to put it through the wringer — 
wrap the sandwiches in it very carefully, then cover in a stone 
jar or something: which will exclude the air.

ALMOND SANDWICHES 

Chop to a mince half a pound of blanched almonds. Add 
half a teaspoon of salt, and mix in a small cup of thick cream 
till you have a paste. Spread on buttered slices of graham 
or whole wheat bread. 

BAKED BEAN SANDWICHES 

Take thin slices of graham bread, butter, and spread with 
baked beans which you have slightly mashed and dampened 
with their own liquor. Add a little finely minced or sliced 
onion, a drop or two of vinegar or lemon-juice, and a dash 
of salt Press the bread together. 

BEEF SANDWICHES 

a 

A beef sandwich may be made from cold roast beef as a 
filling, or from cold boiled beef. The natural accompaniments 
of beef are onions, tomatoes, and horseradish. If you use 
onion with the beef, scrape or chop it fine, add a little salt 
and pepper and spread over the beef after it has been laid on 
the bread, and before the second slice is added. If you use 
sliced tomato, also have that well seasoned with salt, pepper, 
and a drop of lemon-juice or vinegar before laying on the beef. 
If you use grated horseradish follow the Russian custom and 
mix the horseradish with thick cream, a little salted, spread on 
the lightly buttered bread, lay in the trim and filling of beef, 
and press on the upper slice. 

RAW BEEF SANDWICHES 

Mince the beef you use very fine. Free it from filaments or 
threads, mix in finely minced onion to the proportion your taste 
directs, and season with salt. Spread on graham or white 
bread, set in the ice-box, and serve cold. 

CHEESE SANDWICHES 

Make into a paste quarter of a pound of American cheese, 
a heaping tablespoon of butter, a teaspoon of mustard and a 



SANDWICHES 219 

few drops of wine or cider vinegar. Spread on thin slices 
of bread. 

CREAM CHEESE SANDWICHES 

These are made like the foregoing, and the pot or cream 
cheese is spread before the lettuce leaves are put on. Chopped 
olives wet with a little cream and paprika are sometimes used 
instead of lettuce leaves. 



CHEESE AND WALNUT SANDWICHES 

Slice thin whole wheat bread, or graham or white bread. 
Butter, and spread with cream cheese in which you have 
mixed or pounded English walnut meats, and a dash of 
cayenne. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES 

Chop fine the meat of a chicken — for sandwiches the white 
meat is preferable — ^and with it a few olives as a savory. 
Stir in a mayonnaise to hold all together and spread on but- 
tered bread. 

CHICKEN CURRY SANDWICHES 

Mince cold chicken, pound to a paste with its curry sauce, 
and spread on buttered slices of bread. 

DATE AND FIG SANDWICHES 

Chop fine either dates or figs, moisten with cream or hot 
water, add a few drops of lemon or orange- juice, and spread 
upon thin buttered slices of either graham or white bread. 

EGG SANDWICHES 

Rub to a paste the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs. Mix 
in a teaspoon of made mustard, a little salt, and a few drops of 
vinegar. Chop fine the whites of the eggs, add to the yellow 
paste and spread on thin slices of buttered bread. 



220 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

EGG, BREAD, AND SARDINE SANDWICHES 

Chop hard-boiled eggs not very fine, and with them half 
as many skinned sardines. Season with salt and pepper, and 
when well mixed spread thick on thin slices of brown or 
graham bread. Press the sandwiches together firmly. 

FISH SANDWICHES 

Fish sandwiches offer a happy way of utilizing remains of 
boiled fish, such as salmon, lobster, sole, etc. They may be 
made of the fish minced, or of the fish still kept in solid form. 
If the fish is minced, season it well, make it to a paste with 
butter, and spread on buttered slices of whole wheat or graham 
bread. Between the slices of bread a little scraped onion may 
also be added, or, if the taste prefers, cool slices of cucumber 
which have been soaked in a French dressing. If the fish 
is not minced, but kept in solid meat, soak the meat well in a 
French dressing before it is laid between buttered slices of 
graham or whole wheat bread. Here again scrapings of onion 
or slices of cucumber are not amiss. 

GINGER SANDWICHES 

Chop the ginger fine, soften it with thick cream, and 
spread on either whole wheat, graham, or white bread. 
Candied fruits, such as cherries, pears, orange peel, may be 
used in the same way. 

HAM SANDWICHES 

Cut pieces of cold boiled ham, keeping some of the fat. 
Chop fine, and mix it in a small quantity of mustard which 
has been mixed up with water, a little sugar, and salt. Add 
to the ham a small quantity of chopped cucumber pickle, and 
stir all together. Slice two pieces of white bread thin, turn 
so that the pieces match, butter the bread, and spread the 
ham on one slice thickly. Turn the other slice over it, and 
cut in one or two pieces, according to the size of the slice. 



SANDWICHES 221 

HAM AND ONION SANDWICHES 

B^ween thin slices of buttered rye bread lay a thin slice 
of boiled ham, touch the ham lightly with made mustard, 
and press the bread together. A very thin slice of Bermuda 
onion may be laid on the ham, if the taste so directs. 

JUNE ROSE SANDWICHES 

New made and onsalted batter when packed overnight 
with fragrant rose leaves absorbs their perfume. Cut deli- 
cate slices of white bread in fingers or dollar sizes, spread 
with the butler, lay on a few petals, and press together. 

LETTUCE SANDWICHES 

These sandwiches are made of slices of white bread but- 
tered and holding between them two or three crisp, white 
lettuce leaves on which a pinch of salt and a few drops of 
lemon-juice or a spoonful of mayonnaise have been placed. 
Or graham bread is used. The lettuce leaves are sometimes 
cut in ribbons instead of being kept whole. 

LOBSTER SANDWICHES 

Mince a boiled lobster. Season it to your taste with minced 
onion, salt, pepper, and lemon-juice. This may be put on the 
o&der slice of iM'ead, and have for its upper part a slice ol 
bread and butter holding a small lettuce leaf. 

MUSHROOM SANDWICHES 

Cook the mushrooms, cut small, and when tender add a 
little cream and a seasoning of crisp bacon cut in small pieces. 
Season also with salt and pepper and spread on thin slices 
of bread. 

MUTTON SANDWICHES 

Like beef sandwiches, these may be made from either the 
roast or boiled meat. Again arises the question of what is a 



222 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

natural savory herb or vegetable to accompany the meat 
Chopped olives may be laid on the slice of mutton, or capers 
minced and mixed with a little cream, or thin slices of tomato 
which have soaked in a French dressing, or slices of crisp 
cucumber which have had the same saturation. 

NUT AND CHEESE SANDWICHES 

For these you may use pecans, English walnuts, almonds, 
or our own hickory nuts. Pound to a paste or chop fine half 
a cup of the nut meats. Mix thoroughly with a roll of 
Neufchatel cheese, add half a teaspoon of salt in the mixing 
and spread on thin slices of whole wheat, graham, rye, or 
white bread. 

NUT AND FIG SANDWICHES 

Take equal parts of English walnut meats and figs. 
Chop the walnuts fine. Also chop the figs and set them to 
cook slowly with a little water. When they have dissolved 
into a paste add the chopped nut meats, squeeze in a flavoring 
of lemon or orange juice and spread between thin slices of 
graham bread. 

OLIVE AND CUCUMBER SANDWICHES 

For these use graham or white bread. Chop together 
equal parts of olives and small cucumber pickles. Stir them 
together with a mayonnaise dressing and spread on slices of 
bread. 

OLIVE AND MINT SANDWICHES 

Use equal quantities'of chopped mint and olives, and let 
them stand a few hours in a French dressing. Take thin slices 
of graham bread, butter, spread with the mint and olives, 
and press together. 

OYSTER SANDWICHES 

Take two dozen oysters, chop fine, add salt and cayenne, 
and heat in a saucepan. Drop in a tablespoon of butter and 



SANDWICHES 228 

three tablespoons of fine breadcrumbs. Cook three or four 
minutes and cool for spreading on thin slices of buttered 
bread. 

PEANUT SANDWICHES 

Take fresh-roasted peanuts, chop fine, mix with a ma- 
yonnaise dressing and spread on thin slices of graham, whole 
wheat, or white bread. 

SARDINE SANDWICHES 

Take boneless sardines — or if the more common sardine, 
scrape off oil and skin, open lengthwise, sprinkle with a few 
drops of lemon- juice, and lay between slices of thinly buttered 
graham or white bread. 

TONGUE AND TOMATO SANDWICHES 

Upon a thin buttered slice of white bread lay cold boiled 
tongue cut in delicate slices, and upon each slice of tongue 
a thin slice of tomato sprinkled with a dash of salt and pep- 
per. Cover with another buttered slice and press together.

TO MAKE DRY YEAST 

HAVE one heaping coffee saucer of flour. Boil one cup of 
hops in enough water to scald this flour. Mix the water 
with the flour. Let cool. Stir in a cup of dry yeast, wet 
with enough water to soak it. Set to rise in a warm place 
till light. Then stir in cornmeal till it is thick enough to make 
into small cakes and dry, but do not heat in drying. 

In making this begin the work in the morning so that you 
can see it all accomplished before night. 

PERENNIAL YEAST 

A simple and effective yeast of home brew is called peren- 
nial because it may be made to last some time. To dwellers 
remote from groceries it is of considerable value. When once 
you have started it, keep it by renewing it each week. To 
start it dissolve a cake of compressed yeast in two tablespoons 
of the water in which you cooked your potatoes for dinner. 
Do not use the water when it is hot ; let it become lukewarm. 
Next fill half full of lukewarm potato water a glass preserving 
jar — ^ quart jar. Add half a cup of granulated sugar, and 
when it is dissolved in the potato water add the dissolved 



YEAST 226 

yeast Stir ti^ther, and set the can, loosely covered, in a 
warm but not hot place, where the yeast can work. When 
the contents of the jar have become light, seal up the can and 
set it away. The day before you want to make bread fill up the 
can with lukewarm potato water, add half a cup of granulated 
sugar, and let stand for twenty-four hours, when you will have 
a can full of foaming white yeast. Beat and use half a can 
of the yeast for making three loaves of bread. Mix the bread 
at once and use as much lukewarm water as yeast. Seal up 
the can from which you took the yeast and set it away. When 
again you want to make bread take the day before for filling 
again with lukewarm potato water and half a cup of granulated 
sugar, and allow fermentation for twenty-four hours, as above 
directed. 

POTATO YEAST 

Take one quart of sliced potatoes. Wash in cold water 
and put in a large tin saucepan. Tie up in a square cloth a 
bunch of loose hops, as many as you would gather in your 
fingers. If the pressed hops are used (which are not quite 
as good) take half a package. Cover the potatoes with two 
quarts of hot water, in which put the hop bag. Boil slowly 
until the potatoes are soft enough to mash. Place a colander 
over a large crock. Put into it a full teacup of flour. Pour 
over the flour the boiling water and potatoes — to scald it. Mash 
all through the colander with a potato masher. Wash the 
saucepan in which the potatoes boiled and have it ready for 
use. Move the colander from the crock to the saucepan while 
the potato is being pressed through. Add one pint of 
warm water for that which has boiled away. When all is 
pressed through in the saucepan, wash the colander, potato 
masher, and crock. Set the colander over the crock. Press 
the potato water through again. Have ready two cakes of 
compressed yeast dissolved in cold water. Now add to the 
potato three-quarters of a teacup of white sugar, in which 
mix one teaspoon of ground ginger and one iron spoon, heap- 
ing, of salt. When this is mixed and all is cool to lukewarm, 



226 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

stir in the 3Feast. Set in a warm piaoe (bat not hot) to rise. 
Cover. When very light put away in Mason glass jars with 
covers. Fill the jars three-quarters full, as at first. ITfae yeast 
will rise more Set away in a cold place or in an ice-box. 
When yeast is made again use one yeast cake and half a tea- 
cup of potato yeast.

Dissolve two cakes and a half of the ounce yeast cakes of 
Fleischmann's make. To dissolve them put in three table- 
spoons of cold water. Take a quart of blood- warm water and 
a heaping teaspoon of salt, and add the dissolved yeast cakes. 
Have flour sifted into a pan or bowl, and stir the yeast mix- 
ture in till you have a dough stiff enough to lift from the bowL 
Lift the dough to your bread board, having first floured it 
well, and knead the dough thoroughly, putting to it more 
flour until it does not stick to your fingers or to your bread 
board. With hot drippings grease a warm bowl, set the dongh 
in the t|pwl and grease over the top of the dough. Cover to 
protect from cold and set in a warm place to rise — ^not hot, 
merely warm. In about three hours the dough will have risen. 
Form it into loaves, brush the loaves with hot drippings, set to 
rise in a warm place for an hour, and bake till a golden 
brown. 

BREAD MADE WITH POTATOES 

Boil three large potatoes. Mash them while hot, adding 
a piece of butter half as big as an egg, one teaspoon of sugar, 
and half a teaspoon of salt. Mash all together perfectly 
smooth. Take a pint of warm water, half of it pour over the 
potatoes, moisten a feacup and a half of flour with the other 
half. Beat the flour batter well to remove all lun^, and add 
it to the potato batter. Then add half a teacup of yeast, or 
one-third of a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in half a 
cup of warm water. Add also half a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in half a cup of warm water. Beat together this thin 
batter and set in a warm place, where the bottom of its dish will 



BREAD 227 

be kept warm overnight. Next morning sift into your bread 
tray a quart and a half of flour and half a teaspoon of salt. 
Make a hole in the middle of the flour and pour in the sponge. 
If the risen sponge is good it will be full of bubbles. Knead 
well — ^five or ten minutes — with both hands, but keep the 
dough soft, and use on your hands only as much flour as is 
necessary. After sprinkling flour all round, over and under the 




Rolling Pb (area daunetcr) 

dough, cover with a cloth and set in a warm place. It should 
rise to double its size in about an hour. Knead again and 
divide into two loaves. Set the pans in a warm place until the 
loaves have risen to the top. Bake in a quidc oven about 
half an hour. 

If you wish to make biscuits, after the first kneading take 
about half the dough and roll out the biscuits. Let them rise 
a few minutes in a warm place and bake in a quick oven. 

BROWN BREAD 

Mix together one cup and a half of commeal, one scant 
cup of wheat flour, one cup and a half of graham flour, one 
cup of New Orleans molasses, one teaspoon of salt, and two 
teacups of buttermilk. Beat well together and add two tea- 
spoons of soda dissolved in cold water. Mix again. Bake in 
one-pound baking-powder cans in a rather hot and steady 
oven. Set the covers on the cans. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD 

Thoroughly mix together two cups of sour milk, one cup 
of sweet milk, two cups of Indian meal, two cups of graham 
flour, three-fourths of a cup of molasses, one teaspoon of salt, 
and one teaspoon of soda. Pour in a greased brown bread 
mold, fasten the cover on tight, bake in a moderate or slow 
oven three or four hours or longer. 



228 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

BUTTERMILK BREAD 
Bring to boil two quarts of buttermilk. Have in an 
earthen jar or crock which is perfectly sweet from washing and 
scouring one teacup of sifted flour. Over this flour pour and 
stir in the hot buttermilk. When cooled to blood-heat stir in 
half a cup of fine yeast and flour enough to make a stiff 
batter. Stir thoroughly and beat thoroughly and set in a warm 
place. Next morning sift flour in your bread bowl or pan, 
pour in the batter and let stand an hour. Then mix and knead 
long and thoroughly. Set to rise, and when light quickly 
make into loaves ; let stand a few minutes and bake in a mod- 
erately heated oven. 

GRAHAM BREAD 
Mix into three pints of graham flour one heaping teaspoon 
of salt, one scant teacup of molasses, and one cup and a half 
of buttermilk. Beat well together and add one heaping tea- 



spoon of soda dissolved in cokl water. Grease the pans w«U 
and bake in separate loaves. Bake slowly for two hours. Set 
a pan of warm water in the upper oven above the bread. 

RYE BREAD 

Mix a large spoon of butter with a large ^>oon of sugar 

and a teaspoon of salt. Over this pour a [Mnt of boiling milk, 

cover and set to cool. When lukewarm add a teaci^t of lively 

yeast — or one yeast cake dissolved in a cup of warm w^er. 



BREAD 229 

Add also wheat flour till you have a thin hatter. Set over- 
night. Next morning stir in rye flour to make a soft dough 
and set to rise. When the dough is light, add rye flour enough 
to make a firm dough. Set to rise again. Again knead well, 
make into loaves, and bake in an even oven. 

RYE AND INDIAN BREAD 

Dissolve a yeast cake in a cup and a half of water and 
add enough wheat flour to make a sponge. Set to rise over- 
night well covered in a warm place. Next morning scald 
together a quart of water and a pint of molasses and stir in 
four pints and a half of cornmeal. When this has cooled 
to lukewarm stir it in the sponge, and then add a heaping pint 
of ryemeal, a pint of wheat flour breadcrumbs soaked in 
water and mashed smooth, and lastly a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in two tablespoons of warm water. Stir all together 
thoroughly and set in a warm place to rise. When light, 
separate into loaves, let rise again, and bake in a sure, mod- 
erate oven three hours. 

SALT-RISING BREAD 

Scald one cup of fresh milk, and when it is slightly cooled, 
pour it over two tablespoons of cornmeal in a pitcher. Beat 
well together, cover the pitcher with a saucer and stand it 
overnight in a pan or bowl of warm water in a warm place. 
Next morning add a cup of warm water, one teaspoon of salt, 
half a teaspoon of soda and flour to make a batter. Set in a 
pan of warm water and in a warm place till light, which will 
probably be in two or three hours. Put one quart of flour in 
a pan, add a tablespoon of lard and one of salt, pour in the 
batter and knead well. Make into loaves, let rise, and bake. 

Keep this kind of bread very warm all the time it is mak- 
ing, but do not spoil the ferment by scalding it. The fermenta- 
tion is supposed to be from germs or bacteria the sponge 
abaorbs itom &e asr* 



280 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 

Mix through one quart of entire wheat flour one teaspoon 
of salt, two tablespoons of molasses, and one-quarter of a cake 
of compressed yeast dissolved in cold water. Mix and knead 
four or five minutes. Set to rise at night in a warm place. 
In the morning knead five minutes more. Divide in two 
parts and put in greased pans. Let rise until light, which will 
take almost an hour. Bake one hour in a rather brisk, steady 
heat. 

BREAD STICKS 

When you are making yeast bread, leave out a small por- 
tion of the dough. Cut from this small pieces, roll out till 
twice as long and about the thickness of a common lead pencil. 
Set to rise for half an hour, and bake in a hot oven about 
a quarter of an hour. A long, narrow dripping-pan will serve 
for a pan. The sticks should be a soft crust brown all round. 

HOT CROSS BUNS 

Mix together one pound of flour, quarter of a pound of 
sugar, a pinch of cloves and of mace, quarter of a teaspoon 
of cinnamon, and half a pound of currants which have been 
washed and dried. Next dissolve a yeast cake in a cup of 
warm water, and add a cup of scalded milk. Make a hole in 
the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the liquid. Grad- 
ually work in the flour, and after thoroughly mixing, cover 
and set in a warm place to rise. When very light, work in 
two heaping tablespoons of butter, knead and again set to rise. 
If on this kneading the dough is not soft, work in a little 
scalded milk. After the second rising, form your buns, and 
set the pan in a warm place for half an hour. Mark the top of 
each bun with a cross, using a knife. Afterward brush with 
the white of an egg and sprinkle with sugar. 

CINNAMON LOAF 

On a breadmaking day, when your dough has risen and is 
light, take out a Itunp weighing two pounds. Cut up quarter 



ROLL6 381 

of a potmd of batter, slightly warmed, in a cup of milk and 
beat in three eggs. Stir this mixture gradually into the dough 
and mix thoroughly,. also adding half a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in a tablespoon of hikewarm water. In one cup of 
sugar have mixed one tablespoon of powdered cinnamon. 
Form the bread in the shape of a loaf, make deep incisions in 
the top of the loaf, and press the cinnamon and sugar into 
the cuts, pulling up the dough over the little pockets of sea- 
soning. Put the loaf in a greased pan and bake with the other 
bread. It is nice eaten warm for supper or lunch. Do not 
cut in pieces. Cut the crust and then break irregularly. 

ROLLS 

Mix through one pint and a half of flour one teaspoon of 
salt, one teaspoon of sugar, one beaten egg, one pint of luke- 
warm milk, and three-quarters of a compressed yeast cake, 
or half a teacup of potato yeast. Beat all together thoroughly. 
Set to rise in a warm place and cover. When very light, 
knead well, adding enough more flour to make a delicate dough 
for biscuit. Set to rise again. When lig^t, make into roHa 
oblong in shape. Put in greased pans and when the rolls rise 
almost even tc^ether they are ready to bake. Dust the top 
with a piece of soft paper dipped in melted butter. Bake in 
a steady oven for half an hour until a light brown, 

VIENNA ROLLS 

Mix a cup of lively yeast in a quart of lukewarm milk. 
Then stir in a quart of flour and set to rise in a warm place. 
In two or three hours, add flour enough to make a stiff dough, 
add also a tablespoon of sugar and the same of salt. Set to 
rise again, and after four or five hours take on a board and roll 
in thin sheets, not more than quarter of an inch thick. From 
these sheets cut triangles. Roll up the triangles from the base 
so that the apex will come in the centre of the roll. Bend 
tixem in quarter-moon shape, brush with melted butter, let 



282 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

rise for half an hour, and bake. Instead of forming the dough 
from triangles the rolls may be made in ordinary form. 

RUSK 

Make a sponge overnight of one teacup of flour, half a 
teaspoon of salt, and half a pint of lukewarm water or milk. 
Dissolve a compressed yeast cake in cold water. Add this to 
the sponge, and beat very hard. Cover well and set to rise in 
a warm place overnight. In the morning, add half a teacup 
of melted butter (not hot), half a teacup of sugar, and two 
beaten eggs. Stir all together and beat thoroughly. If more 
flour is needed to make a delicate soft dough which you can 
knead a little, add it. Roll out half an inch thick and cut 
with biscuit cutter, or make into oblong rolls. Put in a deep, 
greased pan. Let rise nearly to the top of the pan. Rusk needs 
to be lighter than bread rolls. When ready to bake, dip a 
soft piece of paper in egg and sugar beaten together and 
dust the top with the mixture. Bake in a steady oven about 
half an hour. If they bake too fast, set a pan of warm water 
over them in the upper oven. A small sifting of grated nutmeg 
on top the rusk is liked by many. 

BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT 

Measure one quart of sifted flour and three heaping tea- 
spoons of baking powder. To this add one tablespoon of 
lard and mix quickly through the flour with the tips of the 




Biscuit Cutters 

fingers. Wet with one teacup of milk and water mixed or all 
milk, or all water. Of course, milk is the best. Wash the 
dough off the hands before mixing, and sprinkle the pastry 
board lightly with flour. Also dip the hand into the flour to 
prevent any sticking to the board or the hands. Now turn 



BISCUITS 28a 

the dough on the board, turn it over, knead just twice to have 
it smooth ; then fiour the rolling-pin and roil out half an inch 
thick. Cut the biscuit with a cutter the size you prefer and 
put into pans that are neither floured nor greased. Let them 
stand fifteen minutes before baking, and bake a light brown in 
a quick oyen, which will take about fifteen minutes. 

BREAKFAST BISCUIT 

Beat two eggs, half a teaspoon of salt, a heaping tablespoon 
of butter, and a pint of milk with two pounds of flour. Stir 
in three-fourths of a cup of yeast or a cake of compressed 
yeast dissolved in a little water. Set to rise overnight. In the 
morning form into small biscuits and bake. 

SOUR-CREAM BISCUIT 

Take two cups of flour, half a teaspoon of salt, and a tea- 
spoon each of sugar and of baking-powder and sift together. 
Dissolve half a teaspoon of soda in a tablespoon of cold water 
and beat it into half a cup of sour milk and half a cup of 
cream. Put the cream mixture to the flour when the soda is 
thoroughly worked in it. Stir fast with a spoon and put the 
dough on a molding board which you have spread with flour. 
Pat into a cake. Do not use much flour except to keep the 
dough from sticking to the hand. Cut in small biscuit, lay in 
a hot greased pan, and bake in a hot oven. If you wish to use 
all sour milk instead of cre^m and milk, mix a kitchen spoon 
of lard or drippings with the flour before putting in the sour 
milk. 

BUTTERMILK BISCUIT 

Follow the foregoing directions, using a tablespoon of but- 
ter, lard, or drippings, and mixing this in the flour before 
adding the buttermilk. 

MARYLAND BISCUIT 

Sift one teaspoon of salt with one quart of flour. Work 
into half of this two tablespoons of the best leaf lard, cutting 



284 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the lard into little bits and rubbing into the flour. Mix in 
also one cup of warmed milk. Add by degrees, a spoonful at 
a time, the other half of your flour. By this time the dough 
is thoroughly worked up. Lay the dough upon the board and 
beat it hard with the end of the rolling-pin for about five 
minutes. Roll out very thin cut in shape, stick with a fork, 
and bake in a hot oven. 

QUICK HOT RAISED BISCUIT 

If you wish to get hot biscuit for a meal for three or four 
persons and only five hours off, take quarter of a cake of 
compressed yeast and rub it into a tablespoon of sweet milk 
until perfectly smooth. Add this to a pint of flour, a teaspoon 
of salt and a tablespoon of butter, all of which you have first 
rubbed thoroughly together. Then add milk enough to soften 
and combine all the ingredients into a biscuit dough. Shape 
into biscuit, set in a warm place for three or four hours to 
rise, and wh^ they are light and puffy, bake from half to 
three-quarters of an hour. 

VELVET BISCUIT 

Into a pint of warm milk put two well-beaten eggs, half 
a cake of compressed yeast, a teaspoon of melted butter, and 
flour enough to make a soft dough. Set to rise. When light, 
work down, adding flour and salt. When light again, make 
into small biscuit, and set them close together in pans. When 
light, bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. If the rising is kept 
warm, it will take about six hours to make the biscuit. 

CORN BREAD 

Mix into one pint and a half of commeal one teaspoon of 
salt, one teaspoon of sugar, and two eggs not beaten. Beat 
the batter hard to lighten the eggs. Add not quite two pints of 
buttermilk, one small teaspoon of butter, one small teaspoon of 
lard, melted; and, last, one even teaspoon of soda. Stir all 
together. Have ready an oblong granite pan, into which put 
one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of lard. Set this 



CAKES 285 

on the stove to heat. Melt the butter and lard in it. When 
the pan is hot and the grease melted, pour in the mixture and 
lightly whip the grease through with a fork. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven three-quarters of an hour. If the oven is too hot 
the bread will crack on top. After the bread is browned and 
done, set a pie-pan upside down under it in the oven. Over 
it in the upper oven put a pan of hot water. Cold water would 
cool the oven at once. Leave the bread in the oven about 
ten minutes longer. The overbake to com bread is what gives 
the sweet com flavor. This will not be found if the bread is 
taken from the oven as soon as it is done. 

SOFT CORN BREAD 

Heat two cups of milk in a double-boiler, and when hot 
stir in slowly two-thirds of a cup of commeal. The heat of 
the milk will expand the meal and you will have a mush. Take 
from the stove and add half a teaspoon of salt and the yolks 
of three eggs. Stir together thoroughly and, lastly, add the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Have ready a hot 
baking-pan well greased, tip in the mixture and bake twenty 
to twenty-five minutes. Serve at once, not in square cut 
pieces, for the pressure of the knife might make the bread 
fall, but in irregular pieces as it breaks in lifting. Eat with 
butter, and if you like it sweet add maple syrup. 

JOHNNY BREAD 

Mix three cups of Indian meal with one cup of white flour. 
Also mix one-third of a cup of molasses, a teaspoon of salt, 
a pint of sour milk or buttermilk, and two well-beaten eggs, 
and beat into the meal and the flour. Dissolve in a couple of 
tablespoons of the milk a teaspoon of soda, add to the batter, 
mix in thoroughly, spread on a baking-pan and bake in a hot 
oven. Eat with butter and syrup or molasses. 

SOUR MILK CORN CAKES 

Sift together three-fourths of a cup of flour, three-fourths 
of a cup of commeal, a tablespoon of sugar, three-fourths of 



236 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

a teaspoon of soda dissolved in a taUespoon of o(dd water^ 
and half a teaspoon of salt Pour over the mtxture a cop of 
sour milk and a tablespoon of melted lard or drippiiigs. Beat 
well together, stir in a well-beaten egg, and bake in vrell- 
greased hot popover cups or gem pans. 

CORN DODGERS 

Measure one pint of commeal. Mix into it one teaspoon of 
salt and one teaspoon of sugar. Scald the meal, pouring over 
it about three-quarters of a pint of boiling water. Add one 
beaten egg and one heaping teaspoon and a half of baking 
powder. Stir well together. Add very carefully a very little 
more hot water, so that the batter will be just stiff enough 
to drop from a spoon and keep its shape. The water will 
have to be added slowly, as the batter can easily be made too 
thin. Have ready a fr3dng-pan with just enough hot lard to 
keep the dodgers from sticking. Drop in tablespoons full. 
Do not put too many dodgers in at one time. Cook slowly in 
order to have them well done. Turn them from side to side, 
and brown a light brown. Keep some melted lard ready in 
a cup to add more as you need it. When the dodgers are 
done, set where they will keep hot. This quantity will make 
about fourteen dodgers. 

CORN GEMS 

Mix through two cups of commeal one teaspoon of salt. 
Put the meal in a bowl, a piece of butter the size of an egg in 
the centre, and pour over it one cup of boiling milk. Stir 
well. Then add one teacup of cold milk, three beaten eggs, 
one teaspoon of salt, and one cup of flour. To this stir in 
two teaspoons of baking powder. Beat well, mix thoroughly. 
Pour into hot greased gem pans, and bake in a quick oven 
half an hour. 

CORNMEAL MUFFINS 

Mix into two tin pint cups of commeal one heaping tea- 
spoon of salt, one heaping teaaspoon of sugar, and two eggs not 



MUFFINS 287 

beaten. Measure one tin pint cup and a half of buttermilk, 
add enough of this to the meal to make a batter, stirring hard 
in order to beat the eggs. Next add one heaping teaspoon 
of melted butter, and then stir in the remainder of the butter- 
milk, and lastly, one even teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold 
water. Have the muffin pans very hot, grease well, fill and 
bake slowly a light brown in a moderate oven. 

GRAHAM GEMS 
Mix through three teacups of graham flour one teaspoon 
of salt, the beaten yolks of three eggs, one tablespoon of 
melted butter, and one pint of milk. Next put in the whites 



of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth and two teaspoons of baking 
powder. Mix carefully. Bake in well-greased gem pans 
thirty minutes in a quick oven. 

GRAHAM MUFFINS 
Sift two teaspoons of baking powder and half a teaspoon of 
salt into one cup of flour. Add a cup and a half of graham 
flour. Stir in a cup of fresh milk and then a beaten egg, and 
beat well till the mixture is smooth. Have your muffin tins 
warm, drop in the batter till they are little more than half 
full, and then bake in a well-heated oven till done — ^twenty 
or twenty-five minutes, 

GLUTEN WAFERS 
Put in a bowl a cup of tepid milk, sprinkle in gluten flour 
till you have a dough. Knead wdl, take on your floured board 



288 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and roll very thin. Cut out with a biscuit cutter and take 
brown upon floured baking-pans in a moderate oven. 

OATMEAL CAKES 

Mix into cold oatmeal a small quantity of milk and 
enough white flour to soften, so that it can be made in small, 
flat cakes. Put in a greased pan, and bake in the oven to a 
light brown. 

OAT MUFFINS 

Pour over two-thirds of a cup of rolled oats, one cup of 
scalded milk. Let stand five minutes, then add three table- 
spoons of sugar, half a teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons 
of melted butter. Sift in one and a half cups of flour with 
four teaspoons of baking powder, beat well, stir in a well- 
beaten tgg and bake in greased hot muffin tins. 

OATMEAL WAFERS 

Take what oatmeal you wish to use, add a little salt and 
stir in boiling hot water till you have a thick batter or dough. 
Flour your board, put on the dough, knead it dry, roll as 
thin as possible, and cut in round cakes, first dipping your 
biscuit cutter into flour. Then on a hot griddle cook the 
wafers till they are brown and crisp. When they are browned 
on one side turn and brown on the other. 

SUPPER POPOVER 

Sift three cups of flour with a teaspoon of salt. Little by 
little add three cups of milk, and when you have a smooth 
batter stir in three eggs and a tablespoon of melted butter. 
Now beat the batter hard for three or five minutes, fill pop- 
over cups half full, or if you have not such cups, use your 
gem pans. Be sure your cups or pans are well greased before 
putting in your batter. They need not be heated. Set in a 
quick oven and bake from twenty minutes to half an hour — 
the time being varied by the size of the cakes you are baking. 
The cakes will puflF up over the edges of the ci^)s, and bake 



a golden brown. Serve with maple syrup, or with cream and 
fruit, or merely with butter. 

POTATO PUFFS 
Boil and mash three large potatoes. Add one teaspoon of 
salt and one teaspoon of sugar. Mix together. Add one 
tablespoon of melted lard and one beaten e^. Dissolve half 
a yeast cake in nearly a teacup of lukewarm milk. Stir this 
into the potatoes, and add enough flour to make a stiff dough ; 
that is, about one cup and a half, perhaps a little more. Set 



PopoTcr Cup* 

the dough to rise at two o'clock in the afternoon if you want 
the puffs for an evening meal. When light, roll out thin. 
Cut with a large biscuit cutter. Set to rise for two hours more, 
and bake in a quick oven a very light brown. 

PUFFET 
Melt one cup of butter into one quart of warm milk. Add 
one teaspoon of salt. Beat four eggs very light. Add them 
to the milk when it cools enough to be lukewarm, and also put 
in half a teacup of homemade yeast, or one cake of com- 
pressed yeast dissolved in cold water. Have in another pan 
one pint and a half of flour. Pour the mixture into the dour, 
gradually stirring in well. Continue to add more flour till 
you have a batter that will let a spoon stand. After t>eating 
hard, put the dough in square greased pans. Set to rise, 
covered, in a warm place. When light, bake in square, deep 
pans 



240 THE H01f£ COOK BOOK 

RICE BREAKFAST CAKES 

Bring to boil one pint of milk. Set to cool, and when 
cool add two. tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of butter, 
quarter of a yeast cake, a large cup of boiled flaky rice, half 
a teaspoon of salt, and flour to make a stiflf batter. Set to rise 
in a place where it will be warm all night. To prepare for 
breakfast, stir the mixture vigorously and drop from a spoon 
into small hot mufiin rings or gem pans, and bake in a hot o^en. 

RYE DROP CAKES 

Beat the yolks and whites of five eggs till they are a fine 
froth. Then stir in a pint and a half of rye flour, adding 
with it a pinch of salt, a pinch of soda, and a pint and two 
tablespoonfuls of fresh milk. Have hot popover cups. Oil 
them well, drop in the rye batter and bake. 

RYE POPOVERS 

Sift together one cup of pastry flour, one and a half cups 
of ryemeal, one teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of sugar. 
Whip three eggs till very light, add two cups of milk and 
pour gradually into the flour, then beat till frothy. Pour into 
buttered popover cups, which ought to be hissing hot, and 
bake in a hot oven for thirty minutes. [See illustration, Plate 
XXL] 

SALLY LUNN 

Mix into one quart of flour one teaspoon of salt. Add 
one teacup of warm milk and one teacup of warm water, half 
a cup of melted butter, half a teaspoon of soda dissolved in 
cold water, and four eggs beaten to a stiff f rodi. Stir this to a 
smooth batter, and add four iron spoons of potato yeast. Seat 
hard after the yeast is added. Grease a tin pan with butter. 
Pour the mixture into it to rise. Set in a warm {dace. It 
will not be light under six hours. Bake three-quarters of an 
hour in a steady oven. When done, turn it out to send to the 
table. 



CREAM SCONES 241 

BARLEY SCONES 

Bring a pint of milk to boil in a saucepan, adding a tea- 
spoon of salt. Mix in fresh barley meal till you have a stiff 
paste. Then proceed as in making cream scones. Roll out 
the paste and cut it in cakes — these cakes are very often tri- 
angular. Bake on a greased hot griddle or in a pan in a quick 
oven. Serve hot. 

CREAM SCONES 

In a saucepan bring to boil a pint of cream. Sift in enough 
flour to make a thick batter, while sifting keeping the cream 
hot, but not boiling. Add a teaspoon of salt. Flour your 
board and put the dough upon it. Roll out till about quarter 
of an inch thick, cut in small cakes, and cook on a hot griddle, 
slightly greased, till a golden brown, turning the cakes when 
one side has browned and then browning the other side. Serve 
hot

of this pan suet in it. Have a smooth stick with a piece of 
doth wound on one end with which to grease your griddle. 
Set the cup of suet on the stove to melt die fat before be- 



ginning to bake cakes ; then grease the griddle with it. This 
is superior in every way to any other fat for greasing griddles, 
and more wholesome than others. 

BREAD PANCAKES 
Break stale bread into small crumbs and soften in milk till 
you have a smooth batter. To every pint of batter stir in two 
eggs and half a teaspoon of salt. Beat firmly, and then bake 
on a griddle, browning both sides. 

BREAD BATTER CAKES 
Soak one pint and a half of coarse, stale breadcrumbs in 
CMie pint of milk. This can be done overnight. Mash the 
soaked bread with a potato masher until smooth. Add one 



244 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

teaspoon of salt and two beaten eggs. Stir well. Put into 
one pint of flour two heaping teaspoons of baking powder. 
Add to the breadcrumbs and stir thoroughly. Bake on a hot 
griddle, greased with beef suet which has been tried out. 
These bread cakes take a little longer to bake than ordinary 
batter cakes. If preferred, the yolks and whites can be di- 
vided. The yolks put in with the flour, and the stiffly beaten 
whites the last thing before baking. 

WHEAT BATTER CAKES 

Mix through one pint of wheat flour half a teaspoon of 
salt, one even teaspoon of baking powder, and the yolks of 
two eggs not beaten. Measure one pint of buttermilk, and 
beat into the flour enough to form a batter and to beat the 
eggs thoroughly. Then add the rest of the buttermilk, one 
teaspoon of melted butter, and three-quarters of an even tea- 
spoon of soda dissolved in cold water. Last, put in the stiffly 
beaten whites of the eggs and mix them gently through the 
batter with a fork. When baking, lay the spoon on a plate; 
that is, do not put it in the batter, as it makes the cakes heavy. 
Grease the griddle with beef suet which has been tried out. 

NO-EGG SOUR-MILK PANCAKES 

Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of soda 
in a tablespoon of cold water and mix with a pint of sour 
milk. Then slowly stir in flour to make a batter of the right 
thickness for baking. Grease your hot griddle lightly with 
suet or a piece of salt pork, drop the cakes in even form, 
and cook till a soft brown. Serve at once on a hot plate. 

BREAKFAST DROP CAKES 

Mix one tablespoon of sugar with one egg and a pinch of 
salt. Add a cup of sour milk, a teaspoon of soda dissolved 
in a little water, and flour enough to make a stiff batter. Drop 
from a spoon into hot lard, fry a delicate brown, and drain

BUCKWHEAT CAKES 

Mix 'together one pint of buckwheat flour and three- 
quarters of a cup of graham flour. Into this put one heaping 
teaspoon of salt, half a cup of potato yeast, and one pint and a 
half of tepid water. Mix and beat very hard and smooth. 
Set to rise overnight near a fire, or in some very warm place. 
Buckwheat being a heavy flour, breakfast cakes should be 
put to rise as early as eight o'clock in the evening, and kept 
covered. For convenience, mix in a tin saucepan with a 
handle. In the morning, before baking, add a good pinch of 
soda dissolved in cold watejr and one tablespoon of molasses. 
Grease the griddk with suet that has been tried out. 

ST. LOUIS PERFECT CORN CAKES 

Mix into one pint and a half of commeal one teaspoon of 
salt. Scald it with one pint and a half of boiling water. Add 
one tablespoon of molasses and two eggs not beaten. Beat 
hard together to lighten the eggs. Add to this half a pint of but- 
termilk, one even teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water, and 
half a pint of white flour in which is mixed half a teaspoon of 
baking powder. Last, put in one dessertspoon of melted but- 
ter. Do not make the cakes too small in putting them on the 
griddle. Grease the griddle with beef suet that has been tried 
out In stirring up the cakes, use a tin saucepan for lightness ; 
it is easier to manage. 

GREEN CORN PANCAKES 

Have sweet, tender green corn. Cut down the middle of 
each row of kernels, and with the dull edge of the knife 
scrape'out the pulp of the com. To a pint of the scraped-out 
pulp add half a cup of milk, two eggs beaten, salt and pepper 
to taste, and flour enough to make a pancake batter. Heat 
a pancake griddle, and cook as you cook buckwheat or wheat 
cakes. 



246 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

HOE CAKES 

Put in a pan a teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of sugar, 
and with these stir a pint of yellow commeal freshly ground. 
Over this pour boiling water to wet it to a soft dough thick- 
ness, not a thin batter, but a soft dough. Be sure the water is 
boiling hot, and stir fast, so that the meal will absorb and 
swell. Have a hot griddle well greased. Drop from a spoon 
and gently flatten the cake till it is about half an inch thick. 
Brown it till it is a golden hue on both sides. Serve hot, and 
eat with butter, or with butter and molasses, or with cream 
and scraped maple sugar. 

RICE BATTER CAKES 

Mash one teacup of rice already boiled soft. Mix into it 

two or three beaten eggs, one even teaspoon of salt, one table- 

f spoon of melted butter, two teacups of flour, in which two 

heaping teaspoons of baking powder have been mixed. Stir 
well together, and add one pint of milk. Bake on a hot grid- 
dle greased with beef suet which has been tried out. Mix 
the cakes in a tin saucepan with a handle for convenience. 

RICE PANCAKES 

j Wash and boil a cup of rice till the kernels are perfectly 

[ tender. If water remains with the rice, drain it off, for the 

rice should be dry. Into a cup of flour sift a heaping tea- 
spoon of baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt. Stir the 
flour gradually into one pint of milk, add three eggs well 
beaten, and last of all, the cooked rice. Beat well together, and 
bake on a hot greased griddle. Put the batter on with a large 
spoon, and since the rice prevents a ready spreading of the 
I batter, help it lightly with the spoon. Brown on both sides. 

CRACKER PANADA 

Toast to a golden brown four or five crackers, pour over 
them boiling water enough to soak them ; pour off the water, 
sprinkle with sugar and dust with nutmeg. 



WAFFLES, GRIDDLE CAKES, TOASTS 247 

TOAST 

Have either white, graham or other breads a day old. Cut 
slices half an inch thick, and lay in a pan in the oven till the 
bread is crisp and dry, not dried hard and inedible, however. 
When dry and crisp, brown it to golden tint over or before 
fire and on both sides. Send to the table hot, where the eater 
butters it as he eats it. 

CREAMED TOAST 

Toast eight slices of bread as directed under "Toast." 
Heat a quart of milk in a double-boiler and thicken till it is a 
creamy thickness by stirring and cooking in three tablespoons 
of flour wetted with half a cup of cold milk. Add half a 
teaspoon of salt. Butter the toast and lay a slice in a deep 
dish. Over it ladle the hot creamy milk. Lay in another slice 
and spread that with the milk. So proceed, keeping your toast 
in a pile, and pouring over the remainder of the milk when 
you have used up the toast. Serve at once. Graham bread 
is better than white for this toast. 

FRENCH TOAST 

Beat together two eggs, add half a cup of milk and half a 
teaspoon of salt. Dip slices of bread in this mixture till both 
sides are covered. Brown in hot fat, or lay upon a greased 
griddle and toast till a golden brown. Serve hot and at once. 

MILK TOAST 

Put one pint of milk in a saucepan. Set it in another con- 
taining hot water. Salt the milk enough to taste slightly salt. 
Dissolve one even teaspoon of flour in a little cold water and 
stir it through the milk while cold. Stir the milk while heat- 
ing, to prevent the flour lumping. When it comes to boil, set 
back, still standing in the water to keep hot, cut off the crust, 
and brown six slices of stale bread from a baker's small loaf. 
Lay in a vegetable dish. Melt one tablespoon and a half of 



I 248 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

butter in the hot milk. Pour the milk over the toast, which 
should be cold before the milk is added. Serve at once. 

MOLASSES TOAST FOR CHILDREN 

Toast the bread as directed under ''Toast." Butter a 
slice, lay it in a shallow bowl, and pour over it molasses pre- 
pared in the following manner: Take a anal! cup of pure 
molasses, not that heavy with glucose, but pure West India 
molasses, and mix with it the same quantity of boiling water 
and a teaspoon of ginger. Pour over the hot toast, let stand 
in a warm place for a moment and eat while warm. 

WATER TOAST 

Having browned slices of bread according to foregoing 
. directions, have ready a hot plate and a pan holding salted 

f boiling water an inch deep. Take the slices of toast singly, 

submerge each, holding with a knife and fork in the salted 
boiling water for a second. Lay on the hot plate, and butter. 
A pile of four or five slices may be made, on a large plate, 
L and should be served as soon as buttered.

FOOD VALUE 

DURING cold weather, when the body requires all the 
warmth possible to be obtained from heat-giving foods, 
one important addition to the day's menu is a perfectly cooked 
breakfast cereal. Two of the best foods for this purpose are 
oatmeal and cornmeal, which are richer in fats than the other 
grains. Oatmeal is the richer of the two in food material, 
but plenty of exercise is required for its perfect digestion. For 
the strong, hardworking laborer it is one of the best and most 
economical of foods. For people who lead sedentary lives, 
the lighter wheat foods, of which there is an abundance in the 
market, are better suited. 

NEED OF VARIETY 

The housekeeper who studies the family health ought to 
familiarize herself thoroughly with the subject of breakfast 
cereals; it is one of large importance. Having found what 
foods are best liked by the household, she might lay in for 
the winter's needs a good assortment and use the cereals 
alternately; a wheat preparation one morning, oatmeal an- 
other, and commeal the next morning perhaps. There will 
be no palling on the appetite with such a routine, besides the 
cereals may be served in a varied style day by day. Baked 
apples are a delicious accompaniment to any of the oatmeal 
or wheat cereals, as are also sliced peaches, well-ripened 



250 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

bananas, dates, or flavored apple sauce. [See illustration, 
Plate XXL] Serve with cream. Never spoil a good cereal 
by serving poor milk with it Cereals are deficient in the fats 
contained in cream and in the salt found in fruits, therefore 
the combination, which is as delicious as it is healthful. A 
preparation like farina is much improved by having stirred 
into it, just before serving, figs, dates, or cooked prunes, cut 
in pieces. 

HOW TO KEEP CEREALS 

When cereals arrive, empty them at once into glass jars, 
and screw the lids on tight Frequently the manufacturer 
or the grocer is blamed for a poor, wormy cereal, which has 
really been ruined by the treatment accorded it on the pantry 
shelves. It is left in the paper case in which it was packed, 
with the cover torn off. Mice regale on it, moths inhabit it, 
dust settles on it, damp induces mould, and presently it is 
spoiled. The manufacturer seals it with care, the grocer 
stores it on dry, clean shelves. Then comes the housewife 
who thinks any sort of treatment is good enough for groceries. 

NEED OF THOROUGH COOKING 

Cereals are infrequently accorded the right of proper 
cooking. An indigestible pasty-looking mess meets with the 
most unfavorable verdict, when, if cooked as it ought to be, 
nothing could be more nutritious or appetizing. The direc- 
tions which accompany a cereal seldom give time enough for 
cooking, unless it be set to boil in a vessel right over the fire, 
which is far from satisfactory. Steaming for hours in a 
double-boiler gives very different results. The method for 
cooking cereals is the same, although measurements differ, 
one cup of cereal absorbing more or less liquid than an- 
other. 

After some study and tests of cereals and the time they 
need for thorough cc>oking, I have compiled the following 
table:

THE WAY TO COOK A CEREAL 

To cook any of these cereals, set the upper half of a double- 
boiler over the fire and bring the water to boil. Add one 
teaspoon of salt for one quart of water. For any coarse- 
grained cereal, the Scotch method of adding the meal — 
"mirlin' it in/' as it is called— can scarcely be improved upon. 
Measure the oatmeal into a bowl, hold it in the left hand, and 
slowly with the right hand sprinkle it into briskly boiling 
water. Until every grain of the meal separates stir con- 
stantly. In five minutes the cereal will have begun to thicken 
slightly. Now set the upper half in the lower part of the 
double-boiler half filled with hot water. Put on the lid and 
allow the cereal to steam till the grains are perfectly swollen. 
Do no stirring after the steaming process begins, or the cereal 
will be starchy, the grains broken and the fine nutty flavor 
destroyed. In cooking a small-grained cereal, such as farina, 
wet it with cold water, add to the boiling water, then cook 
like the oatmeal except that it may be stirred occasionally. 



262 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Indeed^ before it is fully cooked a brisk beating with a wire 
whisk will improve it, breaking any lumps which may have 
formed. 

A SECRET 

One secret of making a cereal as delicious as possible lies 
in proper measurements of the grain and the water. Always 
use the same cup for measuring, and follow directions ex- 
actly. Adding water to thin a cereal when it is half cooked 
or pouring it off to thicken it will ruin the flavor completely. 
When a cereal has cooked the required time and is still too 
moist, it may be thickened in ten minutes by taking oflF the 
lid of the boiler and allowing evaporation to thicken it The 
flavor of many cereals is much improved by using half water 
and half milk in the cooking. Any one who has tasted the 
milk porridge of Scotland will realize this. When the milk 
is used the cereal must be very carefully cooked; it will 
bum readily if set over the fire. Hominy, farina, and oat- 
meal are especially improved by the addition of milk. 

Cracked wheat is delicious eaten cold. It thickens con- 
siderably while cooling, therefore add one-third more water 
than if it is to be served hot. Pour it in a wet mold and allow 
it to jelly. Serve with cream, sugar, and raw or stewed 
fruit. Hominy may be used as a vegetable as well as for a 
foundation for various delicious puddings. This cereal re- 
quires somewhat different treatment from wheat or oatmeal 
preparations. Soak the hominy for several hours in cold 
water, strain and put it in salted boiling water. Cook for 
three or four hours. If used as an accompaniment to meat, 
instead of potatoes, as it is commonly served in the South, 
drain away when cooked all superfluous moisture, add a table- 
spoon of butter and a dash of pepper. Send to the table in a 
hot vegetable dish. Farina, Ralston food, cream of wheat, 
or any of the finely ground wheat preparations make de- 
licious puddings cooked in milk. Add a dash of salt, steam 
till tender, pour into a wet mold and chill. Serve with sweet- 
ened cream or a boiled custard, and any fruit that is in seasoiL 



CEKEALS 268 

ANOTHER WAY TO COOK OATMEAL 

Put into a double-boiler one quart of boiling water, one 
heaping teaspoon of salt, and one even teacup of oatmeal. Stir 
well, and as it thickens stir again, and every little while until 
done. Cook two hours and a half, and when done, turn it 
out into a bowl or crock, and cover at once. When required 
for use, take out the quantity needed, and as it will be rather 
stiff, add a quarter of a tup of warm water. Place this in a 
granite saucepan, cover, and set this saucepan in another, in 
which put hot water. Stir well until softened, and keep water 
in the lower pan. Serve very hot. 

ANOTHER WAY TO COOK CRACKED WHEAT 

Put into a double-boiler one quart of boiling water, one 
even teacup of cracked wheat, one teaspoon of salt. Have 
water boiling in the lower boiler. Stir at intervals, and boil 
four hours. Pour out into a crock and cover. When wanted for 
use, put the quantity needed in a granite pot, add water if re- 
quired to soften it, set this saucepan in another, in which have 
boiling water, cover and heat, breaking up carefully with a 
spoon. Eat with cream. 

CORNMEAL MUSH 

Put one quart of boiling water into a double-boiler, add one 
heaping teaspoon of salt and one pint and a half of commeal. 
Mix the meal with cold water, soft enough to pour into the 
boiling water. Stir well with a wooden spoon, and stir often. 
As it thickens, continue to stir every little while until it is 
done. Boil two hours, and keep plenty of hot water in the 
lower pan. 

FRIED CORNMEAL MUSH 

After the mush is boiled, heat water in a two-quart tin 
pan, pour the mush in while hot, and cover it with a plate 
to prevent a scum forming on the top. When perfectly hard 
and cold, turn it out on a plate, and cut into slices half an 



264 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

inch thick. Turn the slices over and over in axilate of corn- 
meal, and fry in enough lard to keep from sticking to the pan, 
and no more. Cover while frying, and fry a nice light brown. 
Serve very hot, and with maple syrup, if sweet is wished. 

RYEMEAL PORRIDGE 

Put a teaspoon of salt in a quart of water and bring it to 
boil. Then stir in little by little, so that it will not lump, a half- 
pint of ryemeal. Cook gently for an hour either in a double- 
boiler or on the stove, but off the direct heat of the fire.

FREEZING 

Patented freezers sometimes carry with them directions 
for their use. 

In breaking the ice for freezing, a duck or canvas bag and 
hammer or mallet should be used. Or the ice may be chopped 
or shaved. When the ice is in small pieces, pack it in the 
pail or tub about the can which holds the mixture to be 




Ice Shaver 

frozen, putting in alternate layers of ice and rock salt. The 
proportions of ice and salt depend a little upon what you are 
going to freeze and the quality of the ice— commonly the less 
salt the slower the freezing. Ice cream takes a shorter time 
than water ices. But you want ice cream smooth, while fruit 
and water ices are granulated. Therefore, since the slower the 
freezing the smoother, the best general rule for proportion is 
one-third of rock salt to two-thirds of ice. Of different kinds 
of ices, the wet, porous snow ice is best, because its dampness 



266 THB HOME COOK BOOK 

and porous quality allow an easy union with the salt. Ice 
cream is smoother if stirred during the first part of its freez- 
ing, allowing an hour and a half to two hours for the whole 



Guard against any salt getting into the can. Until the 
stirring is over, pack the ice to within an inch of the top of the 
freezer. After the stirring, tie a firm band of cloth about 
the rim of the can and cover the top with ice and salt, to com- 



Ice Cratm Freexer 

plete the freezing. While this is finishing, lay a piece of 
blanket or carpet over the freezer. 

In packing a mixture to keep it frozen, or to chill thor- 
oughly, use less salt than the proportion named above. 

FREEZING WITHOUT A FREEZER 
If one is without a freezer, cream or sherbet may be frozen 
in a tin pail covered and set in a larger pail or tub packed 
with three parts of cracked ice and one part rock salt The 
cream in the pail should be scraped from the sides toward the 
middle and beaten together during the first of the freezing. 
The pail should also be turned round frwn side to side several 
times at intervals. 



FROZEN SWEETS 257 

SALT IN FREEZER 

Do not throw away, the salt which remains in the freezer 
after ice cream has been made. The salt will do for the next 
freezing. If it is slushy and wet, use it for top layer in the 
next freezing, and thus hasten the chilling. 

BAG FOR POUNDING ICE 

White duck makes a good bag. Cut it about fourteen 
inches long ; one width of duck, one yard wide, will make two 
bags. Stitch the bag together with a sewing machine. Make 
a hem on the top one inch wide. Cut a strip of the duck two 
inches wide. Double and stitch it together. This is for the 
handle. Fasten it tig^t on either side of the bag, in the centre. 

TO MAKE MERINGUE SHELLS 

Beat the white of an egg with a knife to a stiff froth. Add 
little by little a teacup of granulated sugar. Lay a clean, strong 
paper on an inverted dripping pan, and on the paper drop the 
meringue with a large spoon. Set the pan in the top of the 
oven and leave the door open. In half or three-quarters of an 
hour the shells will dry out. These meringue shells are filled 
with ice cream and served one on a plate to each guest. 

ICE CREAM 

Dissolve thoroughly quarter of a box of gelatine in a little 
water. To it dissolved, put two quarts of cream, the beaten 
whites of two eggs, a cup and three-fourths of sugar, and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Flavor with what is to your taste, 
and freeze. 

SIMPLE ICE CREAMS FOR CHILDREN 

A simple way to make ice cream for children is to mix a cup 
of sugar, a pinch of salt, and two and a half tablespoons of 
ikmr, and pour over the mixture a pint of hot milk. Set the 
whole in a double-boiler and cook a full quarter of an hour, 



258 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

at the end adding a beaten egg, a cup of cream, and a pint 
of milk with whatever flavoring you choose. 

If vanilla, add a full tablespoon and a half. 

If strawberry or raspberry, crush a box of berries, sprinkle 
with sugar till quite sweet, stand long enough to draw out some 
of the juice, and then add to the cream before freezing. 

If peach, peel and stone a large quart of peaches, sugar 
well, crush and add to the cream before freezing. 

If banana, skin three or four bananas, crush, add a sprinkle 
of sugar and the juice of half a lemon, and put in the cream 
before freezing. 

If chocolate, add scraped chocolate to the boiling plain 
ice cream till you have the quantity suited to your taste. In 
the event of adding unsweetened chocolate, extra sugar should 
be put in. 

BURNED ALMOND ICE CREAM 

Sweeten to your taste a custard of four eggs and a pint of 
milk. Take half a pound of blanched almonds and brown them 
in a saucepan with six tablespoons of sugar. Pound to a 
paste and add little by little a quart of cream. Mix with the 
custard and put in the freezer. After it is frozen pack it in 
a mold or serve without molding. - 

ALMOND AND RAISIN FROZEN PUDDING 

Boil one cup of sugar in a cup of water till the sugar 
begins to thread. Move where it will merely simmer, and stir 
in gradually the yolks of four eggs which have been beaten. 
Let boil till quite thick. Take from the fire and beat till cool. 
Then add a tablespoon of gelatine soaked in two tablespoons 
of water and beat till thick. Stir in a pint of boiled cream, a 
cup of ground almonds, half a cup of seeded raisins, pack in 
a freezer and freeze. Instead of raisins candied orange peel 
may be used, or preserved pineapple. This pudding may be 
served plain, or with a sauce of whipped cream flavored to 
the taste. 



FROZEN SWEETS 350 

BOAR'S HEAD 
Boar's head for Christmas is formed by lining a boar's head 
mold with chocolate ice cream, then filling in with a white 
cream of any desired flavor, using strawberry cream for the 
tongue and a candied strawberry for each eye. When serving, 
surround with Christmas holly. [See illustration, Plate XXII.] 

CHOCOLATE PARFAIT 
Add a cup of thick boiled chocolate and half a cup of sugar 
to a quart of thick cream. Whip to a froth, pour into a mold 
and freeze. 



CHOCOLATE SAUCE FOR ICE CREAM 
Scrape or powder one ounce of unsweetened chocolate and 

melt in half a cup of hot water. Stir in gradually a cup of 

sugar, and when the mixture boils take from the fire and beat 

it with half a cup of cream. 

In using, pour the hot sauce, not over, but round the pieces 

of ice cream as they are served on small plates.

COFFEE PARFAIT 

To a cup of sugar add five tablespoons of strong liquid 
coffee. Heat, and add the yolks of four eggs, and then one 
pint of cream whipped. Freeze. 

FROZEN EGGNOG 

Separate the yolks and whites of four eggs. Beat the 
yolks with one cup of sugar, add a pint of cream, and freeze. 
When partly frozen, add the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth, four tablespoons of sherry, one tablespoon of 
brandy, and one of maraschino. Finish the freezing and serve. 

FROZEN LADY FINGER PUDDING 

Beat together three heaping tablespoons of granulated 
sugar and the yolks of six eggs. When beaten to a froth, beat 
in one pint of cream, and add a dozen lady fingers cut in pieces 
half an inch long and sprinkled with or dipped rapidly in some 
wine . like sherry. When all are stirred together, put in a 
mold, cover tight and freeze. 

LEMON ICE 

In one quart of water put the juice of four lemons and 
two cups and a half of sugar. Add the beaten whites of two 
eggs and freeze. 

LEMON SHERBET 

Boil together twenty-five minutes one and a half pints of 
sugar and three pints of boiling water. Add the juice of ten 
lemons. Cool and freeze. 

MAPLE CREAM 

Whip stiff a pint of cream. Add a cup of cold maple 
syrup of about molasses thickness. Beat thoroughly into the 
cream, adding, or not, as your taste directs, a few drops of 
lemon. Pack in a mold and freeze. This may be served in 
claret or lemonade glasses. 



FROZEN SWEETS 261 

MAPLE ICE CREAM 

Boil two cups of maple sugar over a slow fire. Beat the 
yolks of four eggs, stir in the hot syrup, and cook till it 
thickens. Whip two cups of cream, add to the eggs and 
syrup after you take from the fire. Set to cool and then freeze. 

MAPLE PARFAIT 

Stir the yolks of four eggs into one cup of boiled maple

WHEN the warm days of spring come the sweets we eat 
should be delicate and light. Such sweet didses lessen 
the housemother's labors if she will but make them from fresh 
growths. We greet the spring acids with delight— our sys- 
tems crave them— and in early spring and summer we have 
rhubarb, pineapples, gooseberries, strawberries, cherries, cur- 
rants, and other delicious new growths. 

ANGEL FOOD PUDDING 

Use a cake of medium-size of angel food. Cut it through in 
an upper and under half. For a filling to ^read upon these 
halves — ^as you spread strawberries on a shortcake — ^whip stiff 
one pint of cream. Into it stir half a cup of chopped and 
seeded raisins, half a cup of almonds and walnut me&ts 
mixed, half a cup of soft candies or marshmallows, or any 
candied fruits you may have in small bits. Flavor with wine, 
or brandy, or vanilla. Spread the cream and fruit over the 
lower half of the cake, lay on the^pper half with the crust 
side down, spread this also with the cream and fruit, and serve. 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 265 

APPLE BETTY 

Break up small pieces of stale bread with its crust. Put 
into the bottom of a pudding dish nice-flavored, sliced apples. 
Over this strew a good deal of sugar, several lumps of butter, 
and sprinkle well with ground cinnamon. Next a layer of 
apples, again sugar, butter, and ground cinnamon. Then an- 
other layer of the broken bread, more sugar, butter, and cin- 
namon. Fill the dish in this manner, and have the bread the 
top layer, and on it also put butter, sugar, and cinnamon. 
Pour cold water down the side of the dish until it comes al- 
most to the top. To succeed this must be made rich with but- 
ter, and very sweet, and baked thoroughly. Set into a mod- 
erately hot oven, with a pan of warm water above it in the 
upper oven to prevent the bread burning, and bake a light 
brown and until the apples are very soft. When done, serve 
with rich cream. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS 

Peel and core nice flavored apples. Take out the core with 
a coren Make the dough the same as for baking-powder 
biscuit, using more or less milk as the flour may need to roll 
out nicely. Lay the dough on a pastry board, and roll out 
each dumpling the size of a small saucer. Lay one apple in 
each piece of dough, and sugar where the core has been taken 
out. Carefully fold the dough over the apple. To steam 
dumplings put a perforated pie-plate upside down in the 
steamer, and on this set a thin plate with the dumplings on it. 
Set the steamer over a pot of boiling water, and have ready 
a double piece of muslin a little larger than the top of the 
steamer. Cover it first with this and then with the lid, on top 
of which lay a heavy weight to keep it closely covered. Steam 
forty minutes. If you prefer to boil the dumplings, grease a 
cloth with a little lard, and sprinkle flour over it, then put the 
dumpling in and tie it. Drop into a pot of boiling water and 
boil half an hour. Serve hot with hard sauce, or simply open 



266 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the dumpling and lay a piece of butter on to it, and add rich 
cream. To my taste this latter sauce is the best. 

FRIED APPLES 

A JEWISH DISH 

Peel and cut in halves five tart apples. Dip the halves 
in a beaten tgg, then in powdered sugar, and fry in hot butter 
in a saucepan. When done lift out, strew with sugar, and 
serve. 

APPLE WITH MERINGUE 

Cook a tart, juicy apple till soft. Put through a colander, 
sweeten and flavor to taste; then fold in lightly the white of 
an egg beaten dry. Heap the mixture in a pretty dish. 

APPLE AND SAGO PUDDING 

Wash half a pint of sago, cover with a pint and a half of 
cold water, soak an hour, and then cook in a double-boiler till 
the sago is clear and transparent. Have peeled and cored h^f 
a dozen tart apples of the sort which easily cook soft. Mt 
them in a baking dish, pour the sago over and round them, 
cover, and bake till the apples are tender. Serve with sugar 
and cream. 

APPLE SNOW 

Pare and quarter six finely flavored tart apples. Cover 
with cold water and sweeten just enough to be slightly acid. 
Cook slowly until rich and clear, pressing out all the lumps. 
Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth. Put the apple 
in the dish in which it is to be served. Turn the whites 
lightly through the hot apple with a silver fork. Stand in a 
cold place, and serve with cream. 

BANANA SHORTCAKE 

Make a good biscuit crust, according to the directions 
under "Strawberry Shortcake." Then proceed as in short- 
cake making. SpKt open and butter the crust while hot — 



i* 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 267 

buttering on the cut side. Peel three or four well-ripened 
bananas. Shred the bananas till they are finely broken. 
Spread thick on the buttered crust, sprinkle lightly with salt 
and add sugar if the taste directs. Then lay on the second 
buttered crust and another thick layer of bananas, which 
again salt and sugar to taste. The juice of an orange may be 
added also if the taste directs. Serve the shortcake with 
cream, or with a plain boiled custard. 

BANANA SOUFFLfi 

Peel first, then mash with a wooden punch stick or with a 
silver fork three ripe bananas. Add three tablespoons of 
sugar and afterward the whites of three eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth. Put in a buttered baking dish and set in a well- 
heated oven for ten to fifteen minutes. Serve hot with cream 
as a sauce. 

Other fruits, such as peaches, soft apples, prunes, dates, 
etc., may be used instead of bananas for such a souffle. But 
fniits with a fibre, tough skin, or any harsh ingredient should 
De put through a sieve before adding the sugar and beaten 
whites. 

BARLEY JELLY 

A JEWISH RECEIPT 

Put a cup of pearl barley in a quart of cold water and 
bring to boil. Pour off the water, add another quart, and 
simmer gently over a slow fire for three hours, stirring fre- 
quently. Strain, sweeten to taste with white sugar and the 
juice of a lemon; add quarter of an ounce of isinglass dis- 
solved in a little water, and pour into a mold. 

BAVARIAN CREAM 

Scald two cups of thin cream, and pour it slowly over 
one tablespoon of granulated gelatine, which has been dis- 
solved in half a cup of cold water. Add the slightly beaten 
yolks of two eggs. Put in a double-boiler and cook till the 
mixture coats the spoon. Put through a strainer. When 



268 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

cold add one cup of whipped cream, the whites of the two 
eggs beaten very stiff, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Pour 
into a mold and leave on ice for three hours. Serve with a 
boiled custard or with whipped cream. This cream may be 
flavored with coffee, chocolate, or fruit juice. You may add 
to it chopped nuts, mashed bananas, macaroons, strawberries, 
or candied cherries. 

BOILED BLACKBERRY PUDDING 

Mix through one quart of flour one teaspoon of cream of 
tartar and one teaspoon of salt, three beaten eggs, one pint 
of milk, and one teacup of sugar. Add half a teaspoon of 
soda dissolved in cold water and two quarts of blackberries. 
Mix all together. Add more flour to make the batter stiff 
enough for a spoon to stand up in it, as the berries will thin 
the batter. Grease a pudding cloth (a square piece of un- 
bleached muslin is best) lightly with lard. Sprinkle flour 
over it. Lay the cloth over a colander and pour in the pud- 
ding. Tie it, leaving a little room for the pudding to swell. 
Put in a pot of boiling water. Fasten the ends of the pud- 
ding cloth with the cover of the pot. Set a weight or a 
flatiron on it. Keep the pudding covered with water and 
boil hard without stopping for two hours. When done, turn 
it out on a large plate, and serve with hard sauce. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE 

Upon the bottom of a mold lay a sheet of white paper and 
about the sides range lady-fingers close together. To make 







ills 



Clurlotte Mold 




the filling, dissolve two teaspoons of gelatine in quarter of 
a cup of cold water. Add a pint of hot milk and three- 
quarters of a cup of sugar. As it cools stir in a teaspoon 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 269 

of vaniUa, a pint of cream whipped to a froth, and lastly the 
beaten whites of two eggs. Pour into the mold and set in the 
ice-box for an hour or two while it stiffens. Serve by tipping 
the mold upside down, slipping out the contents, and deco- 
rating the top of the charlotte with powdered lady-fingers, a 
puflF of cream, candy, or candied fruit. 

COFFEE CHARLOTTE RUSSE 

Line a mold with lady-fingers. Whip two cups of cream 
and set in the ice-box to chill. lA a quarter of a cup of cold 
black coffee soften a tablespoon of gelatine. In a double- 
boiler heat three-fourths of a cup of milk and three-fourths 
of a cup of sugar. Stir in two beaten eggs and the gelatine 
dissolved in the black coffee. Beat, strain, and cool. When 
it begins to stiffen fold in the cold whipped cream, and pour 
into the mold lined with lady-fingers. Set away to stiffen. 
In serving, invert the mold and have your charlotte standing 
on a low dish. 

ROSE CHARLOTTE 

Soften an ounce of gelatine in cold water. Boil slowly 
until dissolved in one pint of sweetened cream. Beat four 
eggs light. Add to the jelly mixture, stir well, take from 
fire, flavor with rose extract and pour over slices of sponge- 
cake. When cold cover with pink frosting. [See illustration, 
Plate XXII.] 

CHERRY TAPIOCA 

Soak a cup of tapioca overnight. Next morning simmer 
in a saucepan with one pint of boiling water and a pinch of 
salt till the tapioca is clear. Add a pound and a half of 
cooked cherries without their pits, a cup of sugar and half a 
teaspoon of salt. Bring to boil, and then set away to cool. 
Serve cold with sugar. 

CHESTNUT CROQUETTES 

Boil one quart of chestnuts. Shell, remove brown skin and 
pound fine. To each two cups of chestnut meats allow two 



270 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

beaten yolks, one and one-half tablespoons of butter, half a 
teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and half a teaspoon of salt. Form 
into croquettes ; egg and crumb, and fry in deep fat. Garnish 
with chestnuts glazed with caramel. [See illustration, Plate 
XXIII.] 

CHOCOLATE BLANC-MANGE 

Melt three tablespoons of chocolate in a double-boiler. 
Add a pint of fresh milk and half a cup of sugar. Stir smooth 
three tablespoons of cornstarch in half a cup of cold milk, 
and slowly pour into the hot milk in the double-boiler. When 
the cornstarch thickens the milk and is smooth, flavor with 
a teaspoon of vanilla and pour into small individual molds, 
first wetting them with cold water, or into one large mold 
and cool. Serve with cream and sugar. 

CHOCOLATE CUSTARD 

Melt in a double-boiler with half a cup of milk two table- 
spoons of grated chocolate. When the chocolate is smoothed 
in the milk, add a cup and a half of milk and let all heat 
Beat two eggs with half a cup of sugar. Pour the hot milk 
and chocolate over the eggs and sugar, put back in the double- 
boiler and cook till the custard thickens. Add a teaspoon of 
vanilla, pour in the dish in which you wish to serve it and set 
away to cool. 

CHOCOLATE PUDDING 

Put in a double-boiler a large pint of milk and add three 
tablespoons of grated chocolate. Heat and then add two 
tablespoons of cornstarch which you have blended with a 
little cold milk. Have ready a dish for baking puddings. 
Take the milk mixture from the fire, stir in the yolks of four 
eggs beaten into a cup of sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla, and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Pour all in the baking dish, set in a 
pan of hot water and then in the oven. Bake until the eggs 
are set and the pudding stiff. Beat stiff the whites of the 
four eggs, add a cup of sugar and a little vanilla, spread over 
the top of the pudding and brown in a moderate oven. 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 271 

CORNSTARCH PUDDING 

Salt to taste a quart of milk. Add three well beaten eggs. 
Dissolve in some of the milk three tablespoons of cornstarch, 
stirring it smooth. Put the milk in a saucepan, stir con- 
stantly, and when near boiling add the dissolved cornstarch. 
Stir hard, and boil four minutes. Wet a quart pan or tea- 
cups with cold water, pour the pudding in to harden. When 
perfectly cold turn it out, and serve with a cold boiled custard 
flavored with vanilla for a sauce. 

CORNSTARCH BLANC-MANGE WITH FRUIT 

Put a quart of milk in a double-boiler and heat, keepipg 
one-half a cup from the quart. Take half a cup of sugar, 
four tablespoons (or quarter of a cup) of cornstarch, a pinch 
of salt and wet with the half a cup of milk you reserved. 
When the milk in the double-boiler boils, stir in the sugar 
mixture and stir till all is cooked smooth and the cornstarch 
thickens the milk. Beat to a froth the whites of two eggs, 
and as you take from the fire stir them in the blanc-mange. 
Set to become a little cool. In the serving dish put a layer of 
preserved fruit. Pour the cooled blanc-mange over. Set 
away to chill, and serve with cream. 

CREAM PUFFS 

Melt half a teacup of butter in a teacup of boiling water 
with a pinch of salt. When thoroughly melted and boiling, 
pour it gradually over one rounded cup of flour, stirring 
rapidly until smoothly mixed. When cool add four beaten 
eggs. Beat smooth till free from lumps. Drop a tablespoon 
of the batter on buttered tins and bake from thirty to forty 
minutes in a moderate oven. Put the puflFs close together, 
so they will not spread out. 

CREAM FOR THE PUFFS 

For the cream mix together one teacup of cream and 
half a teacup of boiling water. When boiling stir in half a 



£72 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

teacup of sugar. Beat three eggs into one tablespoon of 
flour. Pour the boiling cream and sugar gradually over the 
^gg^f stirring hard. This done, set the saucepan in another 
of hot water, stir constantly and let the cream gradually 
thicken rather thick. Flavor it with vanilla extract 

When the puffs are cool cut each puff near the top with a 
sharp knife, and cut enough to admit a teaspoon. With a 
spoon put the cream in each puff. 

CURRANT SHORTCAKE 

Sift one teaspoon of salt, three teaspoons of baking 
powder and one quart of flour; then rub into it four table- 
spoons of butter. Add enough sweet milk to work into a soft 
dough. Divide into two parts, and pat out so as to fit two 
oblong pans and bake in hot oven. When done, split and 
spread with butter. Have ready one quart of currants stripped 
from stems. Put in a bowl and add one pint of sugar and 
crush. Spread between the layers of the shortcake. Sift 
pulverized sugar over the top and arrange stems of red 
and white currants on top and stemmed currants about 
the base. 

One seldom sees currants served except when converted 
into jam, but a currant shortcake is as delicious as the famous 
and favored strawberry. When stripped from the stem and 
heaped in a crystal glass and served accompanied with pul- 
verized sugar, they make one of the most appetizing fruit 
dishes to serve for breakfast. [See illustration, Plate XXIIL] 

BAKED CUSTARD 

Stir into a quart of milk four heaping tablespoons of 
sugar. Put in a saucepan and let come to boil. When cooled, 
pour over six well-beaten eggs, stirring constantly. Pour 
the mixture into a deep earthenware bowl, and grate nut- 
meg thickly over the top. Set the bowl in a pan of warm 
water. Put in a moderate oven. Set a pan of warm water 
in the upper oven above it, and bake until a thin knife thrust 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 278 

into the custard will come out without the custard sticking 
to it. 

In making puddings or custards, boiling the milk before 
adding other ingredients will prevent the dish being watery. 
While nutmeg is valuable as a flavoring, it is not generally 
known that it is also an opiate, and in large quantities 
poisonous. 

BOILED CUSTARD 

Beat very light five or six eggs with one teaspoon of corn- 
starch. Mix this into one quart of milk, keeping out two 
whites. Sweeten with four tablespoons of sugar. Pour into 
a granite or porcelain-lined saucepan. Set the saucepan in 
another holding warm water. Let the water gradually come 
to boil, and boil slowly. Stir constantly to prevent the egg 
from curdling. When creamy thick, take from the fire and 
flavor with extract of vanilla or lemon. Beat the whites of 
the two eggs to a stiflf froth. Turn them over lightly in the 
hot custard with a silver fork. Prepare this in the dish it 
is to be served in. If boiled custard is required for a sauce, 
leave in the whites, and use two eggs to a pint of milk. 

CUSTARD TART 

Peel, core, and boil in an earthenware dish, using as little 
water as possible, seven or eight large tart apples of the kind 
that cook soft. When the apples are tender, put them through 
a colander or sieve and add a small cup of granulated sugar. 
Add also the grated rind of a lemon, if you wish, or half a 
nutmeg. 

Make a custard of four eggs, reserving the whites of two, 
a quart of milk and a teacup of sugar. Heat the milk and 
sugar together in a double-boiler, add a teaspoon of salt, and 
then the eggs, stir till the custard thickens, and then remove 
it to cool. When it is cold pour over the apples. 

The whites of the two eggs whip to a froth, add a couple 
of tablespoons of sugar, and spread over the custard. 



874 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

FARINA PUDDING WITH SAUCE 

• 

Beat the yolks of three eggs till thick and lemon-colored. 
Add gradually half a cup of sugar, a third of a cup of soft 
breadcrumbs, and a scant half cup of farina. Fold in the 
whites of three eggs beaten stiff and half a cup of nut meat 
broken in pieces. Bake in three-layer cake tins in a slow 
oven for half an hour and put together with this creamy 
sauce. Cream a fourth of a cup of butter, add gradually 
half a cup of powdered sugar, two tablespoons of milk, drop 
by drop, and one tablespoon of brandy, or a teaspoon of 
vanilla. 

FRUIT GLACfi 

First be sure your fruit is ripe and perfect, without spot 
or blemish. Wipe it carefully. Boil in a porcelain kettle a 
pound of sugar with half a teacup of water until the syrup 
is covered with large bubbles. At this juncture add an even 
tablespoon of clear white vinegar. When the sugar has 
boiled to the point of snapping in cold water take it from the 
fire. Quickly dip in the fruit, and then lay on a dish rubbed 
with a little olive oil. Clusters of grapes may be so glaced, 
and then rolled in coarse granulated sugar. Quarters of 
oranges and lemons also are treated the same way. Be sure 
the skin of the fruit is not broken. 

FRUIT IN JELLY 

Soak half a box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Add a pint of boiling water, 
one large orange and one banana peeled and sliced, a pint of 
chopped English walnut meats, half a teaspoon of salt, and 
sugar to your taste. Pour in a mold and set where it will 
cool and stiffen. Tip from the mold, and serve with cream 
and sugar. 

EARLY SUMMER FRUIT PUDDING 

This pudding is made with currants, cherries, blackberries, 
or gooseberries. Soak in a quart of milk on the back of the 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 275 

stove one pint of breadcrumbs. Add a pinch of salt, a cup 
of sugar, and beat in three eggs. If your taste likes it, add 
also such flavoring as nutmeg, or the yellow of a small lemon. 
Have ready fruit you are going to use. In a pudding boiler or 
mold put a layer of the breadcrumb batter. Then a layer of the 
fruit. Alternate these layers till you use up the batter. 
Cover the pudding boiler tight and plunge into hot water, or 
steam. Allow two hours and a half for the pudding to cook, 
and serve with hard or liquid sauce. 

GELATINE PUDDING 

Separate the whites and yolks of four eggs. Make a 
boiled custard of the yolks and a pint of milk by bringing the 
milk to boil in a double-boiler and stirring in the yolks and 
sweetening to taste. Set the custard to cool. Have one-third 
of a box of gelatine soaked a few minutes in a little cold 
water. Pour over and dissolve it with three-fourths of a 
cup of boiling water. When the custard has cooled add 
the gelatine and the beaten whites of the eggs. Stir all to- 
gether, flavor, and put in a mold to chill. 

GOOSEBERRY BETTY 

Have stewed or canned gooseberries. Cut slices of bread, 
and toast a light brown. Dip some of the slices in fresh milk 
and spread with butter. Then lay them in a pudding dish 
and cover with the stewed or canned berries which have been 
sweetened to your taste. Put in another layer of the toast, 
and again another layer of the fruit. So continue with 
alternate layers till the dish is full. Cover tight and cook in 
a moderate oven half an hour. Serve with whatever pudding 
sauce your taste directs, or with whipped cream. 

GOOSEBERRY FOOL 

Top and stalk a quart of green gooseberries and stew 
them with a little water in an earthen dish till they are 
tender. Mash them through a sieve or colander and make the 



276 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

jam very sweet with either brown or white sugar. Have 
ready in a large bowl a quart of cold boiled custard. When 
the jam is cold mix it thoroughly with the custard and serve 
cold. 

HUCKLEBERRY SHORTCAKE 

Mix together one cup of sugar and quarter of a cup of 
butter. Beat two eggs and stir them with the sugar, adding 
a cup of milk, and afterward gradually three cups of flour 
into which two teaspoons of baking powder have been 
sifted. Reserve a tablespO(Mi of flour for dredging the cup 
of huckleberries, which you stir in last. Have square tins but- 
tered or oiled, and bake the shortcake in these about half an 
hour. The cake should be little more than an inch thick when 
done. Cut in squares, split and eat with butter or thick 
cream. 

IRISH MOSS BLANC-MANGE 

Wash and clean a heaping tablespoon of Irish moss, drop 
it in a cup of hot milk in a double-boiler and let it simmer 
till it thickens when dropped on a plate. Salt and flavor to 
taste, and put through a strainer into molds. This will make 
portions for two. Serve with cream and sugar. 

JUNKET 

In a couple of tablespoons of cold water dissolve a jutdcet 
tablet, or use a little liquid rennet. In a double-boiler heat 
a quart of milk lukewarm, stir in the dissolved tablet, pour 
into the dish in which the junket is to be served, dust it with 
nutmeg, cover and let stand where it is warm till the milk 
"sets." Then cool, and serve with cream and sugar. 

LEMONS CREAMED 

From two good-sized lemons grate the rind and squeeze 
the juice. To this juice and yellow rind add two cups of 
sugar and two beaten eggs. Beat up two tablespoons of flour 
with a little cc4d water and add to it a cup of boiling water. 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 277 

stirring all the time. Turn this upon the sugar, eggs, and 
juice mixture, and then simmer over a fire till sntooth, the 
flour being thoroughly, cooked. Set to cool, and when luke* 
warm add a cup of cream which has been whipped. Chill 
and serve cold in a glass dish. 

LEMON JELLY 

Dissolve half a box of gelatine in cold water. Add one 
pint of boiling water, the juice of two lemons, two cups of 
sugar, and strain. Make the day before using, and set away 
to harden. 

CHILLED ORANGES 

Cut six oranges in halves. With a silver spoon take out 
the pulp and mix with half a cup of sugar and the juice of 
half a lemon. Set in the ice-box with the halves of the skins 
in cups. When ready to serve, fill the cups, put a tablespoon 
of whipped cream on each, and allow two cups to each plate. 

PEACH COBBLER 

Cut peaches in half, cover with water, sweeten very sweet, 
and stew slowly until rich, adding a few stones to improve 
the flavor. When done lay in good quantity in a square 
baking-pan, and almost cover with the juice. Sprinkle flour 
thickly over the peaches and cover with a piecrust quarter 
of an inch thick. Bake a nice brown. When done lift the 
piecrust and turn it over on a platter. Pile the peaches on the 
upturned crust, and add the juice about the crust. Serve hot 
with rich cream. 

PEACH GELATINE 

Dissolve half a box of gelatine in half a teacup of cold 
water. Boil a pint and a half of milk with half a cup of 
sugar. Pour a little of the hot milk over the gelatine to dis- 
solve it thoroughly, and then simmer all tc^ether ten minutes 
and set to cool. Peel and slice half a dozen large, fully ripe 
peaches, or if your peaches are small, use a larger number. 



278 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

When the gelatine mixture is cool, but not stiff, stir in the 
sliced peaches and set to chill. Serve with cream; and also 
sugar if wished. 

PEACH PUDDING 

Peel enough peaches to fill the average pudding dish — 
do not take out the pits. Add about two cups of water, cover 
tight and bake till the peaches are tender. Take the water 
in which the peaches have cooked and to it add a mixture 
made as follows: Beat well four eggs, add a cup of milk, a 
cup of sugar, half a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of butter, 
and a cup of flour into which a teaspoon of baking powder 
has been sifted. Stir together. There should be a thin batter. 
Pour over the peaches, set in the oven and bake till brown. 
Serve with cream. 

PEACH TAPIOCA 

Wash and soak overnight a cup of tapioca. Next morning 
set the tapioca to boil in a pint of boiling water. It is best 
to use a double-boiler. Boil slowly until the tapioca is clear. 
Then stir in a can of peaches. Put in a dish and serve cold 
with cream and sugar. 

PINEAPPLE WITH STRAWBERRIES 

When selecting pineapples pull the centre spines from the 
crown. If they come out easily the fruit is ripe and in con- 
dition to use. If sliced first, the peel can be removed much 
easier than paring the fruit whole. Slice with a sharp knife ; 
then, after paring, with a pointed knife remove the eyes. 
Shredding is done by placing the sliced fruit on to a platter 
and picking it with a silver fork. 

It is popular to serve this fruit in the shell. Cut the 
crown about one inch from the top. With a sharp-pointed 
spoon remove all of the pulp, leaving the shell perfect. Shred 
the pulp, discarding the hard centre; add to this pulp halved 
strawberries, enough sugar to sweeten, and put back into the 
shell. Stand on ice tmtil wanted. Then heap whipped cream 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 279 

or ice cream, flavored with pineapple, on top. Serve on a dish 
with the spines about the base. [See illustration, Plate XXIV.] 

PRUNES WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Stew till tender half a pound of prunes. Drain off the 
water, take out the pits, mash the prunes, and stir in sweet- 
ened whipped cream — b. pint or half a pint, as your taste and 
convenience directs. Put into small cups, chill in the ice-box, 
and drop a spoon of whipped cream in each cup as the sweet 
is served. 

PRUNE PUDDING 

After thoroughly washing one pound of prunes, stew 
them till tender. Put them through a colander and add two 
cups of sugar. Beat to a stiff froth the whites of five eggs 
and stir in the pnmes. Pour into a pudding dish and bake 
ten minutes. 

For the sauce to the prunes heat a pint of milk in a double- 
boiler, add a little sugar to your taste, the yolks of the five 
eggs and a dash of vanilla. Cook a moment after the 
yolks are in. Instead of this sauce cream may be used. 

PUMPKIN CUSTARD 

The old-fashioned red pumpkins are apt to be the best. 
Cut new-moon shaped pieces from a ripe pumpkin and free 
the pieces from seed and rind. Cut in small squares or dice, 
put them in a steamer over a kettle of boiling water and steam 




Small Custard Cups 

tin tender. Next press through a sieve or colander. To a 
quart of milk add five beaten eggs, two cups of sugar, half a 
teaspoon of salt and half a nutmeg. If you beat into the sugar 
before it is added a piece of butter the size of an egg the dish 



280 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

is improved, but the butter is not necessary. Next stir in 
enough of the cooked and sifted pumpkin to make the custard 
creamy. Pour into small custard cups and bake slowly till 
well cooked through, and serve cold, capped with whipped 
cream. 

RASPBERRY CREAM 

Soak half an ounce of gelatine in quarter of a pint of 
water. Set in a saucepan over the fire and dissolve, stirring 
all the time. When it boils add one heaping tablespoon of 
sugar and the juice of half a lemon. Put a teacup of rasp- 
berry jam through a sieve, softening with half a teacup of 
milk or water. To this add the gelatine, and then beat in half 
a pint of thick cream you have previously whipped stiff. Put 
in the whipped cream little by little. Stir or beat till it begins 
to set, then pour in a bowl or other mold, and chill near ice. 

RED RASPBERRY SAGO 

Wash half a pint of sago, cover with a pint and a half of 
cold water, soak an hour, and then cook in a double-boiler till 
the sago is clear and transparent. Have carefully looked over 
red raspberries half filling a glass dish. When the sago is 
cool, almost cold, pour it over the raspberries, and set away to 
cool. Serve with sugar and cream. 

Other fruits, such as pineapple and ripe peaches cut in 
small pieces, and strawberries, may be prepared with sago by 
these rules. 

RICE CREAM 

Boil four ounces of rice ten minutes. Pour off the water, 
add a quart and a half of fresh milk and cook slowly till the 
rice is tender. Reduce the rice to a pulp by putting through 
a sieve or press. Dissolve an ounce of gelatine in a little water 
and add it to the rice. Stir all together, the milk, rice, and 
gelatine over the fire and sweeten to taste carefully, not mak- 
ing too sweet. When mixed set to cool, and when cool stir 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 281 

in the stiff whites of two eggs. Flavor with vanilla or 
sherry or brandy, or what your taste directs; pour in a bowl 
or mold and chill for eating. 

SCALLOPED RHUBARB OR PIEPLANT 

For this breadcrumbs may be used or slices of bread but- 
tered. If you use breadcrumbs allow two tablespoons of 
melted butter to a cup of fine crumbs. Cut rhubarb into small 
cubes or dice and in a pudding dish spread a layer of the but- 
tered bread or breadcrumbs. Over this put a layer of the 
rhubarb dice, a plentiful sprinkling of sugar, and, if you like 
their addition, a few stoned raisins. Repeat the layer of 
bread and the layer of rhubarb and sugar until you com- 
plete your dish, and have a bread layer on top. Pour in enough 
boiling water to cook the plant with steam, cover tight and 
bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. Serve 
with a hard sauce of sugar and butter mixed and flavored 
with nutmeg or lemon. 

RHUBARB JELLY AND WHIPPED CREAM 

There are many wa3rs to prepare rhubarb, each one de- 
licious and not extravagant. When tender the plant should 
not be stripped, as the red skin imparts a delicate flavor and 
temptingly rich appearance to the food. Should the plant be 
tou^, strip off the skin, and clip the tough ends at the bottom. 
Wipe each stalk with a damp cloth before peeling. 

Allow one pound of sugar and one box of gelatine to one 
quart of prepared rhubarb. Stew the sugar and plant to- 
gether, only add one tablespoon of water. Soak the gelatine 
in one cup of cold water. Then add it to the hot sauce, stirring 
until dissolved. Press through a sieve; pour into a mold or 
a deep bowl and set on ice to stiffen. When ready to serve 
dip the bowl in hot water a moment, invert on to a cold dish 
and garnish with whipped cream. [See illustration, Plate 
XXIV.] 



282 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SNOW PUDDING 

Soak two teaspoons of gelatine in a little cold water. Dis- 
solve a cup of sugar in a pint of boiling water and pour 
over the gelatine, stirring all the time. Next add the juice 
of two lemons, and set to cool. Beat the whites of two ^gs 
and add when it is cool, and then beat half an hour. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE 

Mix thoroughly with one quart of flour three teaspoons of 
baking powder, an ounce or a tablespoon of butter, and a 
pinch of salt. Wet this mixture with a pint of milk. Stir it 
with a spoon, not with the hand, and spread on pie or layer- 
cake tin, making the dough even and about half an inch 
thick. Set in a moderate oven and increase the heat after 
the shortcake has begun to bake. It will be done in about 
twenty-five minutes. When the cake is thoroughly baked 
slip a sharp, thin knife quite through it, leaving upper and 
under halves. Spread each half with butter on its soft inner 
side. On a deep dish lay one half with butter side up, and 
over it spread thick strawberries which have been sugared, 
crushed a little with a potato masher or punch stick and mixed 
with cream. Next lay on the upper half of the crust with the 
butter side up, and this in turn cover with the sugared, 
crushed and creamed strawberries. You must work fast, 
for the shortcake must be eaten in its first state. Do not dally, 
but send it to the table at once. 

Sweeten the strawberries before you make your dough, 
an hour before use in the cake is none too early, and have 
them ready for instant work. 

TAPIOCA PUDDING 

Soak till soft in cold water— overnight is best — a cup of 
tapioca. Add a quart of milk and half a teaspoon of salt. 
Boil all together till the tapioca is transparent. Put in 
molds to cool, and serve with maple sugar and cream, or 
with canned peaches and cream, or with any tasty fresh or 
preserved fruit as a sauce. 



WARM WEATHER SWEETS 288 

CUSTARD TAPIOCA PUDDING 
Soak overnight in cold water a cup of tapioca. Drain 
off the water, add to it a cup of sugar, a quart of milk and 
half a teaspoon of salt. Put in a double-boiler and cook till 
the tapicoa is transparent. Add two beaten eggs and a tea- 
spoon of vanilla. Take from the fire and pour into the glass 
or other dish in which it is to be served. Serve cold. 

FRUIT TAPIOCA 
Soak overnight two tablespoons of small tapioca. Next 
morning drain and put in a double-boiler with four cups of 
boiling water. Cover close and boil until the tapioca is trans- 
parent. Then add half a teaspoon of salt, one pound of datra 
stoned, one cup of raisins seeded, half a pound of tigs, and 
one cup of sugar. Cook one hour, and fifteen minutes before 
the cooking ends add half a teaspoon of vanilla. Pour in a 
mold, and serve cold with cream or with whipped cream. 

WINE JELLY 
Put half a box of granulated gelatine into enough cold 
water to cover it. Grate the yellow off the rind of a lemon, add 
to it a cup and a half of water, put in half a cup of sugar, and 




Jdlr (Oeladne) Mold) 

boil up. Pour hot over the dissolving gelatine, set in a pan 
of hot water over the fire, and stir till all is dissolved. Strain 
through a sieve or cheesecloth, add a cup of sherry and set 
away in molds for a couple of hours to get cold and to jelly. 
Serve cold with cream.

WE group the following puddings for cool weather be- 
cause they are heartier than the fruits, jellies, and far- 
inaceous sweets going before this note. In cool weather our 
systems crave more substantial foods and readily digest what 
in warm weather might prove difficult. The bread puddings 
following may be used all the year round, but suet, plum, and 
other similar combinations should be reserved for the cool 
days. 

BREAD PUDDING 

Mix into two cups of stale, fine breadcrumbs two table- 
spoons of melted butter, the beaten yolks of four eggs, and 
quarter of a teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water. Let one 
quart of milk just come to boil, take it off, cool, and add to the 
other ingredients. Add nutmeg to taste, and last the whites 
of the four eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Stir the whites in 
lightly with a silver fork. Bake in a greased pudding pan 
a light brown. Test it by slipping in the pudding a thin 
knife. If the pudding does not stick to the knife it is done. 
Serve with hard sauce. 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 286 

COCOANUT AND BREAD PUDDING 

Take one quart of breadcrumbs and a cup of grated 
cocoanut. Butter a baking dish and put in layers of bread- 
crumbs and cocoanut till the dish is nearly full. Upon the 
crumbs drop a few pieces of butter. Beat two whole eggs 
and the yolks of two eggs together, add a small cup of sugar, 
half a teaspoon of salt, and a pint of milk. For flavoring use 
the juice of an orange or a teaspoon of vanilla. Pour this 
custard over the breadcrumbs and cocoanut, and bake in a 
moderate oven till the custard is set, but not watery. The 
two whites you have reserved from the yolks beat till stiff, 
add two tablespoons of sugar and the grated rind of the 
orange you used for the pudding, or, if you like, almond oc 
vanilla flavoring. Spread upon the cooked pudding, return 
to the moderate oven for a light brown, and serve. 

CRUST AND CRUMB PUDDING 

Put your crusts and crumbs of bread into a bowl and 
cover them with milk. Set on the warm water tank or in the 
dish oven to soak for half an hour. Then mash the bread 
with a fork till all is a fine pulp. To two quarts of the pulp 
add a small cup of raisins, a small cup of currants, a large 
cup of milk, a couple of eggs well beaten, a teaspoon of salt, 
and sugar to taste. Guard against making it too sweet. Stir 
well, pour it into a buttered pudding dish and bake in a mod- 
erate oven one hour and a half, and serve hot. 

ORANGE BREAD PUDDING 

Soak a heaping teacup of fine breadcrumbs in a cup of 
cold water till the crumbs are soft. Grate over the bread- 
crumbs the yellow off the rind of three oranges. Take the 
soft broken pulp of five large oranges, or of six small ones, 
and stir in the crumbs. Stir together quarter of a cup of 
butter, a cup and a half of sugar, and the yolks of four eggs. 
Stir in the breadcrumbs and bake half an hour in a moderate 
oven. Beat the whites of the eggs stiff, add sugar to make a 



386 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

meringue^ put on the pudding and let stand in a moderate 
oven ten minutes to brown. 

COTTAGE PUDDING 

Beat two eggs and stir well into them one teaspoon of 
butter, one cup of fresh milk, one pint of flour, and one and 
a half teaspoons of baking powder. Bake in a shallow, 
square tin, and serve fresh from the oven with a hot liquid 
sauce, or with **Sour Cream Sauce." 

CUSTARD AND CURRANT PUDDING 

Put in the bottom of a well-buttered pudding dish a 
layer of thin slices of bread and butter. Sprinkle over this 
some well-washed currants, and if you have it a few bits of 
candied orange peel. Lay in again thin slices of bread and 
butter and repeat the layer of the fruit. So continue to alter- 
nate till your dish is full, topping off with the currants. Over 
these layers pour a plain custard made from two or three 
eggs to a quart of milk, and sweetened and flavored to your 
taste. Pour gently in order not to disturb the layers of the 
pudding. Set in a moderate oven and bake half an hour, or 
until the custard is set, but not until it becomes watery. 

BOILED FIG PUDDING 

Add to half a pound of suet half a pound of stale bread- 
crumbs, half a pound of sugar, and half a pound of figs 
-chopped fine. Mix together. Next put in three beaten eggs 
and half a teaspoon of soda dissolved in one teacup of milk. 
Grate into this one small nutmeg. Add one wineglass of 
brandy (California), and last one teaspoon of cream of tartar. 
Grease a square pudding cloth lightly, sprinkle it with flour. 
Lay the cloth over a colander. Pour into it the pudding. 
Gather up the cloth and tie firmly, allowing a little space for 
the pudding to swell. Put it in a pot of boiling water. Fas- 
ten the ends of the cloth down with the cover of the pot. Set 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 287 

a weight on top of it. Boil without stopping three hours. 
Serve with liquid or hard sauce. The latter is preferred for 
this pudding. 

\ BAKED FLOUR PUDDING 

i Put into one pint of sifted flour one teaspoon of salt and 

seven well-beaten ^gs. Stir hard, and add to this one quart 
of milk, mix well. Grease a pudding dish, and pour the 
mixture in it. Bake in a moderate oven about one hour. If 
it browns too fast set a pan of warm water in the upper oven 
above it. Serve as soon as done, or the pudding will fall. 
For this use liquid sauce. 

BOILED FLOUR PUDDING 

Put into one pint of sifted flour one teaspoon of salt and 
seven well-beaten eggs, and stir hard. Add to this one quart 
of milk and mix well. Grease a square cloth, sift flour 
lightly over it, lay it over a pan,* pour the pudding into it, 
gather up the cloth, tie it, leaving room for the pudding to 
swell. Have ready a pot of boiling water, put the pudding 
in, leaving the end of the cloth outside to prevent the pud- 
ding turning over. Put on the cover and lay a weight or 
flatiron on the top to hold it down. Keep the pot boiling 
steadily for one hour. Never let the boiling stop, or there 
will be a heavy streak in the pudding. When done turn out 
on a plate, and serve with hard sauce, and serve at once. 

FRUIT FRITTERS 

Beat the yolks of two eggs with a teacup of flour and a 
pinch of salt. Add one tablespoon of olive oil, two table- 
spoons of Jamaica rum, or lemon-juice, and cold batter enough 
to make a creamy batter. When ready to fry, stir in the stiffly 
beaten whites of the eggs. Dip any kind of fruit, pared and 
sliced, in this batter. Fry in deep boiling fat. Serve with 
liquid sauce. 



288 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

FARMERS' FRUIT PUDDING 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg and a cup of sweet 
milk. Add flour enough to make a batter that will spread 
easily with a spoon. Add also three teaspoons of baking 
powder. Butter a baking dish. Put in a layer of batter, then 
a layer of fruit, such as blueberries, blackberries, dien a 
layer of batter, then fruit, and so on till you have used your 
batter. Have the top layer of batter. Bake in a hot oven 
half an hour or more, or until done. Serve with a hard sauce 
or a liquid sauce, as you choose. 

STEAMED FRUIT PUDDING 

Take half a teacup of New Orleans molasses, one teacup 
of suet chopped very fine, little more than half a teacup of 
hot water, and one teaspoon of salt Next two beaten eggs, 
one heaping teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water, two 
teaspoons of allspice, two teaspoons of cinnamon, three- 
quarters of a teaspoon of eloves, half a nutmeg, three table- 
spoons of vinegar, one teaspoon of pure ammonia (from a 
druggist), one cup and a half of dried currants, and one cup 
and a half of raisins stoned, and chopped moderately fine. 
Now stir in three teacups of fiour, and in one of the tea- 
cups of flour (the first one) stir two heaping teaspoons of 
cream of tartar. Set a steamer over a pot of boiling water, 
lay a perforated tin pie plate upside down in the bottom of 
the steamer. Grease a cake pan thoroughly, put your pud- 
ding in it and set it on the pie pan. Lay over the top of the 
steamer a piece of thick cloth (or two pieces), cut round, 
to fall a little below the steamer. Put on the lid, and set a 
heavy weight or a flatiron on top. Boil steadily wiffBut its 
stopping a moment for three hours. At the end of that 
time take out the pan from the steamer and serve. If you 
wish to keep it, set aside to get cool. When almost cold, 
turn it on a plate, leaving the under side on top. This pud- 
ding will keep for two weeks or more. It can be reheated 
and steamed soft by laying an old napkin or a piece of soft 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 289 

muslin in a large colander, setting in the pudding, turning 
the cloth ends over it and covering the whole with a cover. 
Set the colander over a large saucepan of water and keep boil- 
ing until the pudding is soft, which will be in about an hour. 
Serve with liquid sauce, page 294. 

GERMAN PANCAKES 

A nice dessert is a very light wheat flour batter cake, baked 
the diameter of a coffee saucer. When baked a light brown 
lay it on a hot plate. Put in the centre a tablespoon of rasp- 
berry, blackberry, or any other sweet jam. Fold one-half of 
the cake over the other half. Sift thickly with powdered 
sugar, and serve hot. This is for one person only. 

BAKED INDIAN PUDDING 

Mix half a pint of water and one pint of milk. Scald, 
and while boiling hot pour little by little upon six tablespoons 
of Indian meal. Stir in a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
a little salt, three tablespoons of sugar, two tablespoons of 
molasses, and one egg. Beat all together and bake in a very 
slow oven three or four hours. 

BOILED INDIAN PUDDING 

Mix through a teacup of flour one heaping teaspoon of 
baking powder and one heaping teaspoon of salt. Add one 
pint of milk, two tablespoons of melted butter, or four table- 
spoons of sour cream, three beaten eggs, one small pinch 
of soda, and one pint of commeal to make a stiff batter. 
Pour this into a greased one-pound baking powder can, or 
any can of convenient size (a small tin bucket is good). Set 
the can on a plate in a pot in which there is enough boiling 
water to come nearly to the top of the can or bucket. Place 
a weight upon it to keep it upright. Boil two hours. To be 
eaten with maple sugar shaved into a bowl of sweet cream. 
Sour cream also may be used as a sauce. y^l ^

pound of beef suet minced, one-fourth of a pound of brown 
sugar, the grated rind of one lemon, one-fourth of a pound 
of flour, one teaspoon of grated nutmeg, one pound of dried 
currants, half a cup of shredded almonds, half a pound of 
shredded candied orange and lemon peel, one-fourth of a 
pound of shredded citron, half a pint of brandy, and five eggs. 
Mix. Pour into a greased, covered mold and boil for six 
hours. The day you serve it reboil for six hours longer. 
Serve on a platter. Surround the pudding with loaf sugar^ 
pour brandy over it, ignite the brandy, and send the pud- 
ding to the table with the brandy burning. Serve with a 
hard sauce flavored with lemon- juice or brandy. 

ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING 

Clean, wash and dry one pound of currants and stone 
one pound of raisins. Chop fine one pound of. suet. Mix 
these with quarter of a pound of flour and three-quarters of 
a pound of fine breadcrumbs. Grate in half a nutmeg, the 
rind of one lemon, and add quarter of a pound of brown 
sugar and half a pound of shredded and candied orange peel 
cut in small pieces. Have all these ingredients well mixed. 
Then beat five eggs, pour them into half a pint of brandy, 
stirring all the time, and pour over the ingredients you have 
previously mixed. Stir all together thoroughly. You will 
have six pounds. Put in small, well-greased molds and boil 
six hours. When you want the puddingy for use, boil an- 
other six hours. [See illustration, Plate XXV.] 

PLUM GRAHAM PLTDDING 

Have a cup of raisins seeded, chopped, and lightly 
dredged, and one cup of molasses into which two teaspoons 
of soda dissolved in ^ tablespoon of water have been beaten. 
Add the raisins and molasses to a cup of fresh milk, and a 



01 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 291 

teaspoon of salt, and stir in two cups of graham flour. Work 
quickly to catch the molasses in its foam. Pour into a but- 
tered pudding mold, cover tight, and plunge in. a kettle of 
boiling water to boil three hours without let up. When 
cooked tip the mold upside down, slip out the pudding, and 
serve steaming hot with liquid sauce. 

BOILED PRUNE PUDDING 

Chop fine six ounces of suet and mix in six ounces of 
breadcrumbs. Free from the pits and chop half a pound of 
prunes and add them to the suet. Add also a heaping table- 
spoon of sugar and half a teaspoon of salt. Beat three eggs 
and mix with a gill of milk. Pour this over the other in- 
gredients and let stand. Oil or grease a pudding boiler, 
pour in the pudding, set in a saucepan of boiling water so 
that the water will reach three-quarters of the way to the 
top of the pudding boiler, and cook for three hours. Twist 
over the top of the pudding boiler a piece of oiled or greased 
paper to keep out water and steam while cooking. 

SPONGE PUDDING 

Mix quarter of a cup of sugar with half a cup of flour. 
Wet with a little cold milk from a pint of fresh milk. The 
rest of the pint heat in a double-boiler. Stir in the hot milk 
the sugar and flour and cook till thick and smooth. Add half 
a cup of butter, and when well mixed stir in the well-beaten 
yolks of five eggs. Afterward add the whites of the eggs 
beaten stiflf. Pour in well-buttered cups or in a shallow dish, 
set in a pan of hot water in a hot oven and bake about thirty 
minutes. Serve hot with creamy sauce. 

BOILED SUET PUDDING 

Have a cup of finely chopped suet, and a cup of seeded 
raisins lightly dredged. With these stir a cup of ^ molasses, 
a cup of milk, one egg, a teaspoon of ginger, and three and a 
half cups of flour into which two teaspoons of baking powder 



292 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

have been sifted. Butter a mold for steaming puddings, pour 
in the batter, cover tight, and steam for three hours. Serve 
with a liquid or brandy sauce. 

BRANDY SAUCE 

Mix together a heaping tablespoon of Iflour and a cup of 
sugar. Over this pour gradually a pint of boiling water 
and cook in a pan of hot water till the flour thickens, which 
will be in about fifteen minutes. Then gradually stir in half 
a cup of butter and half a cup of brandy. Vanilla and the 
grated rind and juice of a lemon may be used for flavoring 
instead of the brandy. 

CARAMEL SAUCE 

Put half a cup of sugar in a saucepan and stir over the fire 
till brown. Add half a cup of boiling water and simmer ten 
or fifteen minutes. 

CHOCOLATE SAUCE 

Dissolve two ounces of chocolate in a pint of milk in a 
double-boiler. Thicken with a tablespoon of cornstarch dis- 
solved in two tablespoons of milk, and then sweeten with 
three-fourths of a cup of sugar. Add a flavoring of vanilla, 
if your taste so directs. Put through a sieve if you are not 
sure it is smooth. 

CREAMY SAUCE 

Blend in a saucepan over a slow fire three tablespoons of 
butter with one heaping tablespoon of flour. Add half a 
cup of sugar and a cup of rich milk. Take from the stove 
when all is creamy, and add the juice of a lemon and an 
orange. Serve cold. This sauce may be flavored with wine 
or rum instead of orange and lemon. 

HARD SAUCE 

Cream together half a cup of butter and a cup of sugar, 
adding the sugar in four separate divisions. When well 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 293 

mixed together stir in gradually the white of one egg, and 
drop by drop whatever flavoring you wish to use. Some- 
times nutmeg alone is used; again vanilla, or California 
claret, or brandy. Also the juice of strawberries, currants, or 
raspberries. 

CHERRY SAUCE 

'Make the foregoing "Hard Sauce" and mix in it a cup of 
stoned and mashed cherries. 

PEACH SAUCE 

Follow the directions for "Hard Sauce" and mix in a cup 
of peach pulp. 

FROTHY SAUCE 

Beat one egg to a stiff froth. Add three-quarters of a cup 
of sugar and the juice of half a lemon, or lemon extract to 
taste. Just before sending to the table, beat in half a cup of 
scalded milk. 

SAUCE OF FRUIT JUICE 

Add half a cup of water to a quart of crushed cherries or 
berries — either strawberries or currants, or red or black rasp- 
berries, or stewed gooseberries — and boil gently twenty min- 
utes. Put in a cheesecloth bag and drain. To one pint of 
juice add half a cup of sugar (put in a little more sugar if 
your fruit is very sour, but have care not to get it too sweet) • 
Add also to a pint of juice a heaping tablespoon of corn- 
starch. Bring to boil, cook ten or fifteen minutes, and serve 
hot. 

LEMON SAUCE 

Cream half a cup of butter and a cup of sugar. Then 
gradually beat in the whites of two eggs. Set over a kettle, 
or in a pan of hot water, and stir in half a cup of boiling 
water and the juice and grated rind of a small lemon. Serve 
hot. 



294 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

LIQUID SAUCE 

Take two heaping tablespoons of flour and two heaping 
tablespoons of butter, mash together and dissolve in two tea- 
cups of hot water poured gradually over them. Add two 
heaping tablespoons and a half of sugar, a little grated nut- 
meg, and two slices of fresh lemon. Mix in a small sauce- 
pan. Set in another containing water. Let the water 
gradually heat until boiling. Stir constantly with a table- 
spoon to prevent lumping and to have it perfectly smooth. 
Let it be rather thick when done, and add three tablespoons 
of California brandy. Stand in the hot water to keep hot 
until ready to serve, and take out the lemon before serving. 

MAPLE SUGAR AND CREAM SAUCE 

Shave off in fine shavings the maple sugar you wish to 
use, and stir it into half its quantity of thick cream. Stir so 
that the sugar stands through the cream. Sour cream is 
sometimes used instead of sweet cream. Either combines 
deliciously with the sugar. 

MOLASSES SAUCE 

Cook together in a saucepan a cup of molasses, a table- 
spoon of butter, and two tablespoons of cream. Boil slowly 
until a little thick, and then add the grated rind and juice of 
a lemon. Or the lemon may be omitted, and in its stead a 
tablespoon of ginger added. 

SOUR CREAM SAUCES 

Delicious sauces are made from cream that has turned 
sour. One sauce is made by beating scraped maple sugar 
into the cream, allowing a good deal of the rich cream to the 
sugar. The sauce is used for hot boiled Indian pudding. 

Another sauce made from sour cream is to beat in granu- 
lated or pulverized sugar, and to add the rind and juice of a 
lemon — for enough sauce for six persons. This may be eaten 
with bread puddings or with "Cottage Pudding." 



COOL WEATHER SWEETS 295 

VANILLA SAUCE 

Stir water in a tablespoon of cornstarch slowly until you 
have used a cup. Add a cup of sugar and cook in a double- 
boiler till the cornstarch is cooked through and thickens — 
this will take ten or fifteen minutes. Add an even tablespoon 
of butter and half a teaspoon of vanilla, stir these in quickly, 
and serve hot. 

WHIPPED CREAM SAUCE 

Beat together the yolks of three eggs and two heaping 
tablespoons of sugar. Add the juice of a lemon. Heat in 
a saucepan, stir well, but do not boil. Take from the fire 
and beat in a pint of whipped cream. Chill and serve.

A LESSON IN CAKEMAKING 

TO begin with the first steps in the science of mixing, I will 
choose for the lesson a snow cake, one of the simplest, 
most delicate and inexpensive of cakes. This receipt makes 
a good-sized loaf or a large layer cake, using only the whites 
of two eggs, a very satisfactory item in these days of high 
prices. No cake in the great assortment of cakes I might 
choose from is so tender of grain, so delicious, so crisp of 
crust or so all round satisfactory as this is. The receipt Is 
one in everyday use in my own household, because it is 
capable of infinite variation in the hands of an adaptive cook. 
Here it is : 

SNOW CAKE 

Cream together quarter of a cup of butter and one cup of 
sugar, then add half a cup of milk and one and two-thirds of 
a cup of flour sifted with two and a half teaspoons of baking 
powder, adding flour and milk alternately in small quantities. 
When perfectly smooth and white, fold in the whites of two 
eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Flavor with half a teaspoon of 
vanilla. 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 297 

Before beginning the work, let me impress on you that 
poor materials will never make good cake. One needs good 
sugar, the best of tub butter, perfectly fresh eggs and pastry 
flour to have delicate tasting, fine-grained, crisply crusted 
cake. If poor cooking butter or eggs of a doubtful age are 
used, it is of no avail trying to disguise the fact by adding 
a double portion of vanilla ; the strongest taste is uppermost. 
• Before beginning work, get all your materials ready. 
Sift the flour and lift from it one and two-thirds level cups, 
smoothing off the top with a knife ; for in this receipt, and in 
all others I give, the measurements are level, unless other- 
wise stated. Put the flour and baking powder in the sifter. 
Butter the cake pans with a bristle brush and sift flour into it 
till a coating of white covers the inside of the tin. This gives 
a fine crust ; it is easier than lining a tin with buttered paper, 
and the cake is not liable to bum. Measure the butter, sugar, 
and milk, separate the egg, and see that the oven is in good 
condition. If you bake in a gas stove, light both oven 
burners ; it takes about as long for the oven to heat as it does 
to mix the cake. 

If the weather is cold and the butter is hard, warm an 
earthen bowl by allowing hot water to stand in it for a few 
minutes. Pour it out, dry the bowl, then put the butter to 
soften, but never to melt. Butter which has melted will never 
produce a smooth white cream. Take a wooden slitted spoon 
and beat the butter till creamy; this process allows of a per- 
fect blending with the sugar, which add gradually, beating 
constantly all the time. When the cream mixture is light 
and snowy white, sift in a few spoons of flour to keep the 
butter and sugar from separating, as would happen if the 
milk went in first. By the way, always use a slitted spoon 
when making cake. The air, which you are endeavoring to 
beat into the cake, is caught and driven through the slits 
and a perfect blending of ingredients can be quickly accom- 
plished. With the ordinary bowlspoon this process is arrived 
at very slowly. Few cooks realize what an important factor 
quickness is in the beating of cake. The woman of slow, 



298 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

deliberate motions will invariably turn out a heavy cake; the 
quick, energetic cook will have a light, delicious cake. I 
have seen this result many times in codcing school, where 
the same materials, the same utensils, the same well-tempered 
stove were at the disposal of women of diflFerent temperaments. 

To turn again to the cake, which we left at the stage of 
thoroughly creamed butter and sugar, with a small amount 
of flour sifted in. Add now a few tablespoons of milk, and 
beat; then sift in half a cup of flour till it is all in and you 
have a snowy, light batter. If you are making the cake alone, 
stop now and beat the whites of the eggs. If some one can 
help it would be better, at the time you begin the creitfning of 
the butter, that she commence to beat the eggs. When they 
reach the light, dry, frothy condition which is a necessity, 
the cake mixture would be ready to have them folded in. If 
you have to beat the white of egg yourself, it is better to 
allow t}ie cake to wait for it than to let it wait for tlie cake. 
No matter how well whipped it has been, the air will escape 
from it and it will go back to a condition from which it can 
never again be beaten stiff. When it is thorot^^hly whipped, 
fold it into the batter. By folding I mean put the spoon in 
edgewise, lift the batter, and turn it over. Repeat until thor- 
oughly mixed. 

At this point the batter holds millions of little air cells 
obtained by beating, and the bubbles formed by whipping 
air into the whites of the eggs. If at this point the batter is 
subjected to further beating, the imprisoned air bubbles would 
be liberated and the cake would be heavy. Therefore, put it 
immediately into the oven for the air cells to be set by the heat 

There is a certain knack in pouring cake batter into the 
pans, which results in a perfectly flat, well-shaped cake. 
Smooth the batter after it is all in witii a spatula, having the 
mixture come well to the corners and sides of the pans, leaving 
a slight depression in the centre. Never scrape batter from 
a knife or spoon on the edge of the pan. If you do, the cake 
will not rise on that side. Fill the pans three-quarters full if 
you wish the cake to reach the top of the tins. 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 299 

As to the time and temperature for the baking of cake, 
consider its thickness. Small patty-pan cakes and layer cakes 
require a much hotter oven than loaf cake. If you are using 
a gas range, turn on both burners for the small or thin cakes ; 
they ought to bake in twenty or thirty minutes. A loaf cake 
requires a slower heat. Both demand the heat at the begin- 
ning coming from below, while all the tiny air-cells are swell- 
ing larger and larger. If the heat were to come from above, 
a crust would form, the rising process would end in the 
bubbles bursting and the mixture settling down heavy as 
lead. Allow the cake to stand on the lower shelf of the oven 
till the pan is full, then very carefully move it to the highest 
shelf, if it does not seem to be hot enough below. Here it will 
brown more evenly. Always keep the pans as far as pos- 
sible from the sides of the oven; if not hot enough to bum 
cake, they will likely be hot enough to make it rise unevenly. 

When the following receipts call for the butter to be 
creamed before adding the sugar, this should always be 
heeded. The creaming consists in beating and working the 
butter until it becomes like thick cream. In this way the 
oil cells are broken and the texture of the cake made finer 
in consequence. 

Sifting the flour makes it lighter, and, unless stated other- 
wise, should be measured after sifting. 

It is safer to test the cake batter by dropping a little on a 
small pan and baking. If it spreads and is flat, the batter 
needs more flour. If tough, it needs a little more milk. Some 
flour thickens more readily than others, so the exact amount 
can not be judged. 

When using bicarbonate of soda, a level teaspoon is meant 
unless otherwise stated. 

CAKES FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 

Many housekeepers look aghast when the question of 
decorating cakes comes up, and it arises quite often in a 
family where there are young folk. Every housekeeper may 



300 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

try her hand at this feature, which does not invoive much 
extra trouble and needs very little skill. 

Once in a while a prettily decorated cake brought to the 
table when there are no guests other than one's immediate 
family will elicit many encomiums and also tempt the appo- 
tite. 

To write the name on a birthday cake no expensive ap- 
paratus is reqwred: just a couple of cornucopias made of 
thick writing paper and sewed up the side. When the cake 
is ready, cover thickly with icing and set imtil firm. Fill 
the cornucopia with whatever idng the decoration is to be 
of, then, holding steadily in the left hand, commence to press 
from the larger end toward the smaller, pressing the idng 
out in a slender line from the opening. Roses and other 
flowers and geometrical designs and fancy tracings may be 
made. Unless accustomed to this work, it is better to trace 
with a sharp-pointed skewer the design on to the icing first, 
then following it out with the colored. 

ICING 

Beat stiff the white of one egg, stir in a cup of confec- 
tioners' sugar, two teaspoons of cold water, and the flavor 
you choose. Spread the icing upon the cake with a broad- 
bladed knife, constantly dipping the knife in cold water to 
spread the icing smooth. 

ICING FOR CHILDREN'S CAKES 

Put three tablespoons of boiling water on a hot plate and 
stir in icing sugar or confectioners' sugar till you have a soft 
paste. Add as you stir a few drops of the flavoring you 
wish, such as vanilla or lemon. Spread the soft paste on the 
cakes. 

ALMOND ICE 

Mix half a pound of finely powdered almonds ^^ith a pound 
of sugar. Moisten with a dash of orange water and the 
whites of enough eggs to make a paste. With this coat the 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 801 

cake. Over the almond icing a second icing is sometimes 
laid, prepared in the following way: Work a pound and a 
half of fine sugar into the whites of eight egg^, adding now 
and then a dash of lemon- juice. You will have a thick, glisten- 
ing mass. Coat the cake, and dry in a warm, clear air. 

BOILED ICING 

Boil together a cup of sugar and half a cup of water till 
the syrup hairs off a spoon. Take from the fire, and while 
cooling beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth. Stir the 
whites and the syrup together, beating the syrup in with the 
movement you have beaten the eggs. Use whatever flavor 
you choose, or whatever fruits. 

CLEAR ICING 

Stir together half a pound of powdered sugar and the 
whites of two eggs. Then add the juice of half a lemon, 
and stir till clear. Use at once. 

APPLE FROSTING 

Follow the directions for "Clear Icing,** but instead of 
adding the lemon add a cup of grated apple — ^having peeled 
and grated fine, juicy, tart apples. 

CREAM ICING 

Mix together a small half of a cup of thick cream and 
two cups of powdered sugar. Flavor with vanilla, or what- 
ever you prefer, 

ROYAI. ICING 

Put the white of an egg in a bowl and add a tablespoon 
of water, and the same quantity of lemon- juice, or other 
flavoring if you wish. Beat a moment, and then stir in 
powdered sugar until the icing is of the thickness that will 
spread upon a warm cake. Beat hard five minutes^ and then 



802 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pile in the centre of the cake and with a wet knife blade smooth 
round and down the sides of the cake. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI ICING 

Boil a pound of sugar in a gill of water until the syrup 
will hair off the spoon. Take from the fire, add slowly the 
beaten whites of two eggs and beat all together, adding also 
half a pound of blanched and chopped almonds, quarter of 
a pound of fine raisins swelled in hot water, and quarter of a 
pound of citron cut in little pieces. 

CARAMEL FILLING 

Mix two cups of heavy brown sugar with three-fourths 
of a cup of butter and add half a cup of cream. Boil in a 
saucepan until it becomes ropy, and then add one tablespoon 
of vanilla. Put the saucepan in cold water and stir until the 
filling thickens. Spread between layers of cold cake. 

To use the above as candy spread it on a cold, buttered 
platter. When cold and hardened somewhat cut in cubes, and 
allow to harden more before using. 

CHOCOLATE FILLING 

Mix the yolks of four eggs with one square of chocolate 
grated, one tablespoon of cream or milk and one cup of sugar. 
Boil till it grows hard. 

SOUR CREAM FILLING 

Add the white of one egg to a cup of thick, sour cream 
to keep the cream from turning to butter while whipping. 
Whip the cream, sweeten to taste with powdered sugar and 
flavor to your taste with vanilla. Spread upon cool layers 
of cake. Chopped nuts, such as butternuts, pecans, or hickory- 
nuts, are sometimes added to this cream filling. 

FILLINGS OF FRESH FRUIT 

Fillings of fresh fruit are made by putting layers of the 
sugared fruit between the layers of cake, and spreading 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 303 

whipped cream over the fruit. Take for instance straw- 
berries. Mash the strawberries, and sugar to taste. If the 
juice is too plentiful let it drain off and use it for flavoring 
on ice. On a layer of cake spread the strawberries. Have 
whipped a cup of cream with two tablespoons of sugar. 
Spread over the strawberries some of this cream, then put 
on the other layer and repeat the fruit and cream. 

Peaches may be used in this way. Raspberries also, and 
pineapple grated. 

LEMON FILLING 

Mix two cups of sugar, two teaspoons of butter, the grated 
rind and juice of two lemons, and two eggs. Stir together 
and put in a saucepan. Set the pan in another of hot water, 
and boil until the mixture is quite thick. When cool, spread on 
the layers of cake. 

MAPLE FILLING 

Boil a cup of maple syrup till it threads from the spoon, 
and then beat till cool, beating in the white of an egg, 

NUT FILLING 

Boil together half a cup of water and a cup of sugar 
until it makes a heavy thread. Take from the fire and add 
little by little and with constant stirring the whites of two 
eggs. Beat till cool, stirring in a cup of chopped nuts, either 
walnuts, hickory nuts, or mixed nuts. 

FRUIT FILLING 

Follow the directions above, using candied fruits or 
chopped and seeded raisins instead of nuts. 

FILLING FOR ANY FLAVOR 

A soft filling to which may be added any flavor is made 
hy following^ the directions for "Nut Filling," substituting a 
flavoring for the nuts. 



304 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

ANGEL CAKE 

Beat to a very stiff froth the whites of eleven eggs. To 
this add a tumbler of white sugar and about two teaspocms 
of vanilla to taste. Mix one scant even teaspoon of cream 
of tartar into one tumbler of flour. Sift it four times, the 
last time sift into the eggs and sugar and mix together. Put 
in a round pan with circular metal rising in the centre. -The 
pan should not be greased. Bake in a moderate oven until 
a straw thrust in will come out clean — ^that is, twenty or 
twenty-five minutes. Bake a very light brown, and delicately. 

ANGEL FOOD 

Sift together four times a cup of flour (measure after sift- 
ing) and a teaspoon of cream of tartar. Beat the whites of 
eleven eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat in gradually a cup and 
a half of granulated sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. Next 
put in the flour which you have sifted with the cream of tartar 
and beat lightly. Bake slowly forty minutes in a pan lightly 
dredged with flour, or in an earthenware dish. The cake 
should bake gradually. 

DRIED APPLE CAKE 

Put to soak overnight a cup and a half of evaporated 
apples. Stew them soft in half a cup of molasses the next 
day, and set away to cool. Stir together half a cup of butter 
and one cup of sugar. Add two-thirds of a cup of sour milk, 
the stewed apples, two well-beaten eggs, a teaspoon each of 
cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and three cups of flour into 
which you have sifted a teaspoon of finely pulverized soda. 
Stir hard. Have at hand a cup of seeded raisins, two-thirds 
of a cup of currants, and some thin slices of shredded citron. 
Spread a layer of the cake batter in your cake tin, then put 
in a layer of your mixed raisins, currants, and citron. Next 
a layer of batter and then a layer of fruit, and so on till you 
cap the cake with a layer of batter. Bake carefully in a 
moderate oven. 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 805 

BAKER'S CAKE 

Cream together one cup of butter with two cups of 
granulated sugar. Add the yolks of six eggs, beating in one 
yolk at a time. Add little by little one cup of sweet milk, 
which you have warmed. Then put in three cups of sifted 
flour little at a time, stirring constantly until all is well 
mixed. Add the whites of the eggs which you have beaten 
to a stiff froth, folding them in gradually, and last of all 
three teaspoons of baking powder. Flavor with two tea- 
spoons of vanilla, or the juice of one lemon. Bake in a quick 
oven, either as a loaf cake or in jelly cake tins. The secret of 
having the cake light is in the stirring. 

A BIRTHDAY CAKE 

One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, four eggs, two 
tablespoons of molasses, one cup of boiled coffee, three and a 
half cups of pastry flour, five level teaspoons of baking 
powder, one teaspoon of powdered cinnamon, half a teaspoon 
of powdered cloves, half a teaspoon of powdered mace, three- 
quarters of a cup of seeded and chopped raisins, half a cup 
of shredded figs and citron, two tablespoons of brandy. Mix 
all together in the order given. Bake in a loaf pan. When 
cool, ice with any preferred frosting. Place candles in paste 
roses about and edge with flowers. The candles correspond 
or harmonize with the icing and flowers. [See illustration, 
Plate XXV.] 

BRIDE'S CAKE 

Cream a pound of sugar with half a pound of butter. Beat 
to a stiff froth the whites of sixteen eggs. To the creamed 
butter and sugar add the whites and a pound of flour, beating 
strongly all one way and putting in the flour and white froth 
little by little. Butter white paper, lay it in the cake tin, and 
bake the cake in a qtiick oven, having care not to jar the 
stove or oven during the baking. 



806 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

CALIFORNIA CAKE 

Stir together two cups of sugar and one of butter till 
you have a cream. Take the yolks of six eggs, beat them 
light, and add to the creamed butter and sugar. Stir in also 
half a teaspoon of cinnamon and the same quantity of nut- 
meg. Then dissolve a teaspoon of soda in a cup of cold 
water and add that. Next beat the whites of the six eggs to 
a stiff froth and lightly fold in, using first the whites and 
then some of the flour from the four cups you have measured 
out and thoroughly sifted together with two teaspoons of 
cream of tartar. When the whites and flour are all in, add a 
pound of raisins, which you have seeded, chopped, and 
dredged with flour, and a cup of walnut or hickory-nut kernels, 
which you have also dredged. Stir all together and bake in 
two or three loaves in a moderate oven. 

CHOCOLATE CAKE 

Dissolve two ounces of chocolate in five tablespoons of 
boiling water. Blend four eggs with half a cup of butter and 
a cup and a half of sugar. Add half a cup of milk, the dis- 
solved chocolate, one and three-quarters of a cup of flour, one 
heaping teaspoon of baking powder, and a teaspoon of vanilla. 
Bake in a moderate oven. 

CHOCOLATE LOAF CAKE 

Blend half a cup of butter with one cup of sugar. Add one 
whole egg and the white of another, one cup of milk, two 
and a half cups of flour, two teaspoons of baking powder, 
and one teaspopn of vanilla. For the other part of the cake 
boil together in a double-boiler one cup of grated chocolate, 
half a cup of milk, one cup of sugar, and the yolk of the egg 
of which you have just used the white. When this chocolate 
mixture boils, stir it into the white dough and bake in loaf 

- . COFFEE CAKE 

Mix one cup of sugar and one scant cup of butter. Add 
one cup of molasses, one cup of cold coffee, one tablespoon 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 807 

each of cloves and cinnamon, one teaspoon of soda, four cups 
and a half of flour, into which two teaspoons of baking 
powder have been sifted, and one cup of raisins and one cup 
of currants lightly dredged with flour. 

CONFECTION CAKE 

Half a cup of butter, three-quarters of a cup of milk, one 
cup of fine granulated sugar, three eggs, two rounding tea- 
spoons of baking powder, two cups of sifted pastry flour. 
Cream the butter, then add the sugar gradually and cream 
while adding ; then beat in the beaten egg-yolks, the milk, and 
one tablespoon of dry sherry and one teaspoon of vanilla. Then 
add one cup of flour in which has been sifted the baking 
powder. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites; then the other cup 
of flour. Bake in layers. When cool put together with the 
following : 

CONFECTION FILLING 

Stir one and a half cups of sugar and half a cup of water 
until the sugar is dissolved. Boil until it spins a thread when 
dropped from a spoon. Have ready the whites of two eggs 
beaten stiff and dry; then, while beating constantly, pour the 
hot syrup on them and beat until cold and rather stiff. Add 
one cup of chopped nut-meats, shredded figs and candied fruit, 
one teaspoon of vanilla, and a quarter of a teaspoon of lemon 
extract. Decorate the top with currant jelly and whole candied 
cherries; a ring about the base. [See illustration, Plate 
XXVL] 

CREAM CAKE 

Take two eggs, one cup of sugar, one cup of thick sour 
cream, half a cup of butter, and two cups of flour. Beat to- 
gether, and beat in also one teaspoon of soda. T* is c e 
may be without fruit, or you may add raisins, citron etc., 
lightly dredging the fruit. For flavoring use spices, half a 
teaspoon of nutmeg; cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. 



308 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

DELICATE CAKE 

Blend well together two cups of sugar and three-fourths 
of a cup of butter. Stir in one cup of milk and the whites 
of eight eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Stir together three cups 
of flour and two teaspoons of baking powder. Flavor to your 
taste. Beat ten minutes after putting all the ingredients in. 
Pour in a loaf tin in which you have laid buttered white paper 
and bake one hour in a carefully heated oven. 

FRUIT CAKE 

Brown one pound of flour. Cream together a pound of 
sugar and a pound of butter, and then add eight beaten eggs 
and a cup of molasses, half a cup of whiskey, one cup of 
sour cream, and a tablespoon each of mace, cinnamon, cloves, 
allspice, and grated nutmeg. Stir in your pound of browned 
flour and half a teaspoon of soda dissolved, and gradually 
add a pound of seeded raisins, a pound of washed and dried 
currants, and a pound of citfon cut in pieces — all the fruit 
being lightly dredged. Bake in well-buttered paper laid in 
deep pans, for this cake should be in large loaves. Be careful 
your oven is not too hot. 

* 

WHITE FRUIT CAKE 

Mix three cups of unadulterated powdered sugar with 
one cup of butter. Add the whites of ten eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth, half a cup of milk, a dash of bitter almond flavor-«^;. 
ing, and four cups of flour into which three teaspoons of 
baking powder have been sifted. Put in two pounds of seeded 
raisins dredged and half a pound of citron cut in pieces and 
dredged. Bake in a moderately quick oven. 

NEVADA FRUIT CAKE 

Mix one pound of sugar with one pound of butter and 
add tile yolks of ten eggs, half a pint of molasses, into which 
a teaspoon of soda has been stirred, one glass of currant 
jelly, a cup of chopped prunes, a cup of walnut meats, and a 



*%> 



ICING, FILLING, CAKE 309 

teaspoon of mixed spices. Dredge the fruit with flour and add 
a pound of currants which you have well washed and dried, 
three pounds of raisins which you have seeded, three-quarters 
of a pound of citron which you have shredded, and a quarter . 
of a p6und of candied orange peel. Fold in the beaten whites 
of the ten eggs, stir in a pound of flour, divide into two or 
three loaves, and bake in a slow oven two and a half or 
three hours. 

SOFT GINGERBREAD 

WITH OR WITHOUT FRUIT 

Take one teacup of dark brown sugar, one large iron 
spoon heaping of butter, and one large iron spoon heaping 
of lard. Cream these smoothly together. Then add one 
scant teacup of hot water, three beaten eggs, one heaping 
teaspoon of soda, one large iron spoon of vinegar, two even 
tablespoons of ground ginger, two teaspoons of cinnamon, 
half a teaspoon of cloves, one teaspoon of salt, and three- 
quarters of a teaspoon of pure ammonia (from a druggist). 
Last, add three cups and a half of flour. Beat thoroughly 
for five minutes. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a mod- 
erate, steady oven. Set a pan of warm water in the upper 
oven. Do not turn the cake round until partly baked, and 
move it slowly. Be careful to close the oven door gently, 
or the cake will fall. Never leave the door open to cool an 
oven. 

If fruit is wished, use one teacup of raisins chopped and 
fane teacup of currants, floured well. If you use fruit, bake 
one hour. 

This ginger))read with fruit makes a nice dessert steamed 
and eaten with liquid sauce. 



SOFT GINGER CAKE 

Mix a cup of sour cream, a cup of molasses, and half a 
cup of sugar. Add salt and ginger to your taste, and also 
cinnamon and cloves if you wish them. Stir in a teaspoon 
of soda dissolved jn a little warm water and flour enough 



810 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

to make a dough like ordinary cake. Bake in a moderate 
oven. 

CIDER GINGERBREAD 

Mix one cup of sugar and one cup of molasses with two 
well-beaten eggs. Add half a nutmeg, two teaspoons of 
ginger, half a teaspoon of salt, and a large spoon of lard or 
butter. Take a cup of cider and pour three-fourths of it 
into the above mixture and stir welL Then add gradually, 
beating thoroughly, three cups of flour. After you have 
put in the last of your flour add the remaining one-fourth cup 
of the cider into which you have stirred and dissolved one 
teaspoon of soda. Beat all together and pour into a well- 
buttered, shallow pan, and bake about a half an hour in a 
moderately hot oven. 

Do not have the oven too hot. Anything with nxdasses 
in it burns easily, and a quick or hot oven is not the best for 
baking molasses cakes. 

GOLD CAKE 

Cream together a cup of sugar and a scant half of a cup of 
butter. Add to this the yolks of eight eggs which you have 
beaten stiflF, stirring all together thoroughly. Next put in half 
a cup of sweet milk, and next a cup and a half of flour into

BROWNIES 

BEAT together till light quarter of a pound of butter, quarter 
of a pound of granulated sugar, and two eggs. Grate the 
yellow off the rind of a lemon and add, stirring in also four 
ounces of grated chocolate, half a cup of milk, and a pinch 
of salt. Next put in a pound of flour which you have sifted 
three or four times. Stir briskly together, roll out and cut 
in brownie or other shapes and bake in a well-warmed oven. 
These little cakes take on a lustre if brushed over with the 
white of an egg. 

CARAMELS 

The homemade caramel too often lacks the chewing 
quality, which to many constitutes its chief charm. To ob- 
tain this quality, confectioners use glucose, a tasteless, color- 
less, and, contrary to popular belief, harmless thick syrup. 
-Herewith is given a receipt for making caramels that may be 
chewed. Place one pint of cream, four cups of granulated 
sugar, a half pound of glucose, two ounces of butter, two 
ounces of paraffine, quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar, 
and one cup of shaved chocolate over the fire. Mix thor- 
oughly. Bring slowly to boil, and stir constantly until the 
mixture will harden in ice water. Pour half an inch thick 
into greased pans, and when partly cooled mark with a 
greased knife into squares. Instead of using chocolate, 



316 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

chopped nuts or grated cocoanut may be added just before 
turning into the pans. 

CHOCOLATE feCLAIRS 

Measure half a pint of cold water into a saucepan. Add 
two ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, and a pinch of 
salt. When boiling take from the fire and add five ounces 
of flour and stir till smooth. Put over the fire and stir till 
the paste leaves the sides of the saucepan. Cool, and when 
nearly cold drop in three raw eggs, adding and beating in 
one at a time. With a spoon roll the eclairs about four inches 
in length and about half an inch in diameter, brush them with 
white of tggf and bake in a moderate oven twenty minutes to 
half an hour till golden brown. Cool, split, and fill with 
sweetened whipped cream. Put together and glaze with choc- 
olate made in the following way: Boil half a gill of water 
with one ounce of finely powdered chocolate. When smooth 
stir in eight ounces of icing sugar, and a tablespoon and a 
half of water. Beat all together and glaze each eclair. 

CINNAMON DROPS 

Stir half a pound of brown sugar with two eggs till well 
blended, and add an ounce of powdered cinnamon, quarter 
of a teaspoon of salt, and then flour which you have sifted 
three or four times — enough of the flour to make the dough 
stand. Stir all together thoroughly, and drop from a small 
spoon upon the bottom of a pan which you have dredged with 
flour. Bake a few minutes in a well-heated oven. 

COCOANUT COOKIES 

Blend a cup of sugar and half a cup of butter, one egg, 
and a third of a cup of milk. Add a heaping cup of grated 
cocoanut and a cup and a half of flour into which you have 
sifted two teaspoons of baking powder. Stir together. 
Flour your molding board and roll and cut out a few of the 
cakes at a time, adding only flour enough to make them roll 



SMALL CAKES 317 

thin. Bake in a quick oven a light brown and sprinkle with 
granulated sugar while hot. 

COOKIES 

Mix one cup of butter, or refined beef drippings, with 
two cups of sugar. Add one or two eggs, half a cup of sour 
milk, a teaspoon of dissolved soda, and as much flour as is 
necessary to make a dough to drop off a spoon or roll out 
well. To these cookies a tablespoon of caraway seeds may be 
added with the flour. When cooked they may be sprinkled — 
while hot — with white granulated sugar for a pleasant change 
in looks. 

CREAM CAKES 

Take a cup of boiling water in which is melted one heap- 
ing tablespoon of butter. In this stir eight heaping table- 
spoons of flour and heat over a gentle fire until it is in a 
ball. Let it cool, and when cold add four eggs, putting in one 
at a time and stirring each one in before the next is added. 
Separate in cakes and bake in a hot oven. 

CRULLERS 

Mix into two cups and a half of sugar a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut. Next add three eggs not beaten. Beat 
hard, and stir well to lighten the eggs. Next add a little 
salt and one small teaspoon of soda dissolved in cold water, 
one grated nutmug and extract of lemon, to taste. Stir all 
together and add two small teaspoons of cream of tartar, 
mixed into one cup of flour. Stir again, and add eno«gh flour 
to make the dough stiff enough to roll out easily. Use plenty 
of flour on the board and rolling-pin. Roll about quarter of 
an inch thick. Cut into oblong pieces, score each one in the 
centre, and give it a slight twist after dipping the hand in 
flour. Roll all before beginning to fry, as they stiffen by 
standing and are easier to fry. Fry in a deep porcelain 
or granite kettle (a round bottom is best) and turn often 
while cooking. Use plenty of lard and brown a light brown. 



318 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

Lift out with a flat skimmer, and while hot sift over pow- 
dered sugar. When the lard becomes brown, set it aside and 
use fresh lard. Before frying try a small piece of dough in 
the fat to see if it is the right heat. If too hot the cakes will 
be too brown. Keep the crullers in a stone pot. 

DAINTY FINGERS 

Beat together half a pound of sugar and half a pound of 
butter. Add five eggs, the whites and yolks of which have 
been beaten separately, one teaspoon of mace, half a wine- 



Lady Finger Pans 

glass of brandy, and half a pound of flour. Stir thoroughly 
together and drop in lady-finger pans for baking to a deli- 
cate brown. When done and while warm fasten the fingers to- 
gether, painting with the white of an egg upon the flat side. 

DOUGHNUTS 

Mix one cup of sugar with butter the size of an egg. Add 
three eggs, half a teaspoon of salt, and one cup of milk. Mix 
two teaspoons of baking powder with the flour you use and 
stir in flour till you have a dough stiff enough for rolling and 
cutting in shape. Fry in deep, hot lard, and turn often. 

DROP CAKES 

Stir together a cup of sugar and a cup of butter. Instead 
of butter you may use lard or drippings. Dissolve two tea- 
spoons of soda in two tablespoons of cold water, and stir into 
a cup of New Orleans molasses and a cup of sour milk mixed 
together. Add the sugar and butter, a cup of currants lightly 
dredged, and half a teaspoon each of ginger, cinnamon, and 
allspice. Stir in sifted flour until the dough is as stiff as 
fruit cake, and then drop from a spoon upon a greased paper 
laid in a pan. Bake in moderate oven. 



SMALL CAKES 319 

EBONY FINGERS 

Use the receipt for "Coffee Cake/' bake in lady-finger pans, 
and put the flat sides of the cakes together with an icing made 
by stirring powdered sugar into orange- juice and beating thor- 
oughly before using. 

FIG Eclairs 

Steam one pound of figs over hot water one hour. Then 
chop fine and add a pint and a half of Catawba wine (or less 
of sherry) and half a cup of sugar, and cook until like a 
jelly. Bake yellow or white cake in sheets. Split the sheets 
and spread the fig mixture between. Press together, cut in 
lady-finger size pieces, and ice on three or four sides. 

FRUIT COOKIES 

These ought to be made a week or two before they will 
be eaten, as they are greatly enriched by keeping in a tightly 
covered jar. Cream one cup of butter, gradually add a cup 
and a half of sugar, then when light and creamy add three 
well-beaten eggs and one teaspoon of soda dissolved 
in one and a half tablespoons of hot water. Stir in 
two cups of flour with which has been sifted half a teaspoon 
of salt and one teaspoon of cinnamon. Add one cup of 
coarsely chopped hickorynut meats, half a cup of currants, 
half a cup of raisins seeded and chopped with another cup 
and a quarter of flour. Butter a large baking sheet and drop 
the cookie mixture in small spoonfuls one inch apart. Bake 
in a moderate oven. 

FRUIT JUMBLES 

Blend one cup of sugar with a third of a cup of butter. 
Add two eggs, half a !cup of milk, and one and two-thirds of 
a cup of flour into which one teaspoon of baking powder has 
been sifted. Stir in a cup of lightly dredged raisins, spread 
thin in buttered pans and bake in a quick oven. Cut in squares 
while hot. 



820 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

GINGER COOKIES 

Mix together one teacup of dark brown sugar, one teacup 
of lard and butter mixed (more butter than lard), add one 
egg not beaten. Beat and stir hard to lighten the egg. Add 
one teacup of New Orleans molasses, two even teaspoons 
of soda dissolved in cold water, one tablespoon of vinegar, a 
little salt, one tablespoon of ginger, two teaspoons of cinna- 
mon, three-quarters of a teaspoon of cloves, three-quarters of 
a teaspoon of allspice, and four teacups and a half of flour. 
Flour the board and rolling-pin well to prevent sticking. 
Roll thick or thin, as you like. Bake quickly if you do not 
want the cookies hard. Use a greased pan in baking. 

HERMITS 

Blend a ;cup and a half of dark-brown sug^r with half a 
cup of butter, and afterward add three well-beaten eggs. Next 
put in half a nutmeg grated^ a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a 
cup of raisins, seeded, chopped, and dredged. Add a teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in hot water and flour enough to make the 
dough roll out in a soft blanket. Cut with cookie cutters into 
any shape you please — ^animals, letters, or geometrical de^ 
signs. Bake in a moderate oven. 

IMPROVE-WITH-AGE CAKES 

Mix half a cup of butter and half a cap of lard with one 
and a half cups of sugar. Put in three eggs beaten together, 
salt, cinnamon, and cloves to taste, half a teaspoon of soda dis- 
solved in a tablespoon of warm water, and two and a half 
cups of flour. Add a pound of English walnut meats, a 
pound of stoned dates, and a cup and a half of seeded rasins — 
all the fruit having been chopped medium flne. Stir well 
together, drop from a spoon on tins and bake in a medium 
hot oven. Keep the cakes in a stone jar in a cool, dry place, 
and they are better after a little time than at first. 



SMALL CAKES 321 

JUMBLES 

Cream together one heaping teacup of shortening (three- 
quarters of which should be butter, the rest lard) and two 
even teacups of sugar. To this add five well-beaten eggs. 
Mix thoroughly. Next put in one teacup of sweet milk, half 
a teaspoon of salt, half a nutmeg, the grated rind of a lemon, 
and two tablespoons of lemon extract. Beat well together. 
Stir in four teacups of sifted flour. This done, knead in two 
more teacups of flour. Roll out on the pastry board not 
quite a quarter of an inch thick, cut with a small biscuit cut- 
ter, and bake in a floured pan. With a feather or a very small 
brush dust the top of each one lightly with the white of an 
^gg not beaten, and sift over them (with a small tea strainer) 
granulated sugar. Bake in a quick oven a very light brown. 

MACAROONS 

Home-made macaroons cost much less than when bought 
in a bakery — then you know they are fresh. On a large plat- 
ter put three-eighths of a poimd of powdered sugar (sifted), 
half a pound of almond paste and add gradually the whites 
of three eggs slightly beaten. With the hands work this mix- 
ture into a perfectly smooth paste. Line a large baking pan 
with buttered paper and drop the paste from a teaspoon in tiny 
balls half an inch apart. The macaroon mixture slightly 
spreads in baking. They require from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes in a slow oven. After baking, turn the paper to which 
the macaroons stick upside down, wet it with a cloth wrung 
from cold water, and they will come oif easily. 

MAPLE SUGAR COOKIES 

Mix a cup of butter with three cups of maple sugar. Add 
two beaten eggs, a cup of sour milk, and then stir in flour 
and one teaspoon of dissolved soda. Make the dough stiff 
enough to separate in lumps off a spoon, roll out and bake. 



322 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

MOLASSES COOKIES 

Have half a cup of lard or butter and fill up the cup with 
cold water. Mix with two cups of molasses and one table- 
spoon each of salt, vinegar, and ginger. Stir in flour and add 
two teaspoons of soda dissolved in two tablespoons of hot 
water. Put in enough flour to roll the dough in a soft blanket, 
cut in shapes and bake in a slow oven. 

NEW YORK NEW YEAR'S CAKES 

Cream together a pound of sugar and a pound of butter 
and then add a small cup of milk. Gradually stir in three 
pounds of flour into which .three heaping teaspoons of baking 
powder have been sifted, and then add three tablespoons of 
caraway seeds. Roll out the dough in sheets half an inch 
thick, and cut into cakes about four inches long and two inches 
broad. Prick the top with a fork, lay in greased pans, and 
bake a light brown. 

NOAH'S ARK COOKIES 

Take a cup of butter, or of butter and drippings mixed, 
and cream it with two cups of sugar. A couple of table- 
spoons of cream may also be added with good effect. Work 
in also the beaten yolks of four eggs, and then stir in, using 
first a little of the flour and a little of the whites, four cups 
of flour and the whites of four eggs beaten to a froth. Be- 
fore using the flour sift into it four teaspoons of baking 
powder. Grate over the dough quarter of a nutmeg, roll out 
thin, and with the little tin cutters, made after various shapes 
of birds and beasts, cut out the cookies. Bake in a hot oven. 
The cookies may be glazed by brushing with white of an egg 
and then set back in the oven for a moment. Or white or 
colored sugars may be sifted over them for a child's birth- 
day party. But for the child's common use serve them plain. 

OATMEAL CAKES 

Stir one cup of butter in one cup of sugar and add a 
beaten egg and a teaspoon of salt. Stfr in gradually two cups 



SMALL CAKES 823 

of white flour and two cups of oatmeal, adding also a teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in two tablespoons of milk. When you have 
the dough well mixed roll it thin, cut into shapes and bake 
in a moderate oven. 

LITTLE SNOW CAKES 

Little snow cakes are made from plain snow-cake batter 
baked in patty pans. See directions for "Snow Cake" on page 
312. When the cakes are cool, dip each one in an icing flavored 
with orange extract and slightly colored by adding some of 
the grated rind of a fine yellow orange. 

SNOW AND CHOCOLATE BALLS 

Cut a large sponge cake into balls about an inch and a half 
in diameter. Half of the balls dip in chocolate icing, and the 
other half dip in white icing and then in grated cocoanut. 
Dry the icings and then pile together for serving. 

WALNUT SMALL CAKES 

Stir together one cup of butter and one cup and a half of 
sugar. Then stir in three eggs and two cups of chopped 
walnut meats which have been dredged with flour. Lastly 
add a cup and a half of flour into which a heaping teaspoon 
of baking powder has been sifted. Stir together, and from the 
spoon drop tEe dough upon buttered paper laid in tins, allow- 
ing room for the cakes to run as they heat.

FRENCH BONBONS 

BEFORE attempting this variety of sweets, it is imperative 
that one master the art of making fondant, which is the 
basis of all French candies. With this knowledge, the possible 
changes and combinations are almost limitless; without it, 
nothing can be done. 

There are two popular ways of making fondant; but as 
both produce, practically, the same results, which shall be used 
is a matter of choice. 

RAW FONDANT 

To the white of one egg add an equal quantity of ice water 
(this may be exactly ascertained if the white of ^g is first 
measured in a glass) and a teaspoon of extract. Beat until 
the mixture is light, then add, gradually, one pound or more 
confectioner's XXX sugar. Work with a spoon until smooth 
and firm. 

COOKED FONDANT 

Place over the fire four cups of XXX sugar and one cup 
of water; stir with a wooden spatula until the sugar is dis- 
solved, no longer. Boil ten minutes, or until it "threads." 
Remove the saucepan to the table and test the fondant by 
rubbing a little of it between the fingers. If it balls, turn into a 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 825 

bowl. When partly cooled, add flavoring, then beat with the 
spatula until stiff enough to knead with the hands like bread. 

The fondant resulting from either of these mixtures may 
be shaped into balls, squares, small cubes, disks, and many 
other forms. A little experience will enabk one to do this 
readily. If vegetable colorings — which are harmless — be 
used, the French candies may be more perfectly imitated. For 
flavoring, use extracts or fruit juices. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS 

Dip plain creams, shaped from fondant, into melted sweet 
chocolate and they become chocolate creams. This dipping 
must be done quickly. Nothing is better for holding the 
creams while dipping than a long hatpin. Harden on oiled 
paper. 

COCOANUT CREAMS 

Add grated cocoanut to the fondant, shape into cones, 
brush over with beaten white of egg and roll gently in grated 
cocoanut. 

FRUIT BONBONS 

Stone candied cherries, white grapes, or dates and fill 
with small rolls of fondant flavored with vanilla. 

FRUIT CREAMS 

Add chopped fruit to the fondant and shape to suit the ' 
fancy. Or form into a loaf and cut into small square slices. 
By substituting chopped nuts for the fruit one has delicious 
nut loaf. 

NUT CREAMS 

Pecan, peanut, almond, hazelnut, or English walnut meats 
are converted into nut creams by rolling them in fondant and 
then dipping in melted chocolate. Or press the meats into 
little cakes of the fondant. 

Thus one combination suggests another equally delicious, 
and from even a small amount of fondant a great variety of 



826 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

bonbons may be evolved. It is wiser to make the fondant 
in small quantities. If more is needed, make again. The 
results warrant this expenditure of time and trouble. 

VARIEGATED CREAMS 

Divide the fondant into three or more parts. Color and 
flavor each differently. Mold into flat cakes, pile one upon 
the 'other, press firmly but carefully together, trim the edges 
neatly, then cut into squares, cubes, or strips. 

BUTTER SCOTCH 

To four tablespoons of sugar and six tablespoons of mo- 
lasses add two tablespoons of water and four tablespoons of 
butter. Melt all together slowly and cook slowly, stirring 
often, till it hardens when dropped in cold water. 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS 

Boil together three cups of sugar, one cup of milk, one- 
fourth of a cake of Baker's chocolate, and butter the size 
of an tgg. Have care about your fire. This dish will bum 
easily, and the fire must be moderate and the mixture well 
watched in the cooking. Drop a spoonful in water to test; 
if it hardens it is done. Pour in buttered pans and cool. 

CHOCOLATE PUFFS 

Beat stiff the whites of two eggs, and then beat in half a 
pound of powdered sugar. Scrape fine an ounce and a half 
of chocolate and dredge it with flour. Add gradually to the 
eggs and sugar, and beat all together hard. Upon the bottom 
of baking pan lay a sheet of paper, and upon the paper lay 
powdered sugar in spots about as big as a silver half dollar. 
Upon these powdered sugar spots pile the chocolate mixture, 
smooth with a wet knife dipped in cold water, sift over a 
little sugar, and bake in a hot oven a few minutes. Cool and 
loosen from the paper with a thin knife. 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 827 

COCOANUT KISSES 

Beat the white of an egg and add half a cup of sugar. 
Stir constantly until it will not drop from a spoon. Add three 
tablespocxis of grated cocoanut. Drop on buttered paper and 
bake lightly. 

COUGH CANDY 

In one dish put a gill of whole flaxseed and pour over it 
half a pint of boiling water. In another dish put a cup of 
slippery elm broken in small bits and cover it with boiling 
water. Let both stand and macerate two or three hours. 
Then put them in a cheesecloth and strain by squeezing into 
an earthenware saucepan. Add a pound and a half of sugar 
and boil slowly fifteen minutes. Then add the juice of two 
lemons. Cook till it candies easily, pour on buttered paper or 
plates and cool. 

CREAM CANDIES OF DIFFERENT SORTS 

Melt four cups of granulated sugar in a cup- of cream and 
boil together five to seven minutes. Set the saucepan in cold 
water, put in a teaspoon of vanilla, and stir the cream till it 
is hard enough to make into balls. 

To make chocolate creams, dip the balls in melted chocolate. 

To make walnut creams, press into two sides of a small 
ball two perfect half meats of the walnut. 

To make date creams, press into two sides of a small ball 
the halves of dates freed from the stone. 

FUDGES 

Measure two cups of granulated sugar and one cup of 
milk. Set this on the fire to heat. After it is warm, add a 
piece of butter the size of an egg and three heaping table- 
spoons of grated chocolate. Boil twenty minutes. To judge 
whether it is done, drop a little into ice water, and if it 
stiffens, remove from the fire, and add a teaspoon of vanilla 
and beat until almost cold. Have ready buttered pans. Pour 



328 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

the mixture into them, and mark them off in squares. Set 
away to cool. 

MAPLE FUDGE 

Take a cup and a half of maple sugar broken into very 
small pieces and half a cup of granulated sugar. Add a cup 
of milk, set over the fire, and add two heaping tablespoons of 
coarsely grated or scraped unsweetened chocolate and a table- 
spoon of butter. Boil all together carefully for half an hour. 
To test if it is done put a little in a saucer ; if it hardens, it is 
done. Take from the fire, stir in a teaspoon of vanilla and 
a cup of walnut meats, keep on stirring till the fudge begins 
to stiffen, and then pour into shallow buttered tins. Mark 
off in squares and set in a cool place to chill. 

MOLASSES CANDY WITH NUTS 

Put one tablespoon of butter, two tablespoons of water, 
and one cup of sugar in a kettle. Stir and watch when the 
mixture boils. Then add half a cup of molasses of the best 
sort — ^not the adulterated which floods the market, but pure 
New Orleans molasses if you can get it. Boil fifteen minutes, 
watching carefully, and then test. If the mixture candies in 
cold water, it is done. Have on the bottom of buttered tins 
rows of hickory-nuts or other meats you have picked out while 
the syrup is boiling. Pour the syrup over the meats and cool. 

NOUGAT 

To make this most delectable of candies, melt over the fire 
in a porcelain-lined vessel one pound of fine white sugar 
with two tablespoons of water. Have ready a half pound of 
sweet almonds, blanched and chopped. When the syrup be- 
gins to turn yellow, add the nuts, stir for five minutes, add a 
little grated lemon-peel, and pour at once into a well-oiled flat 
pan. When partly cooled, mark with a greased knife into 
bars. 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 329 

PEANUT CANDY 

Meh slowly in a saucepan a pound of heavy wet brown 
sugar — ^add no water. Shell a quart of fresh roasted peanuts 
and chop them a little. When the sugar is cooked to a thick 
syrup, shake a little salt over the peanuts and stir them in. 
Pour in shallow buttered tins and cool. 

PRALINES 

The fame of these delicious sweetmeats has come north 
from New Orleans, where you find them sold on the streets. 
Boil tc^ether two scant cups of powdered sugar, one cup of 
maple syrup, and half a cup of thick cream. When this 
mixture can be dipped into cold water and forms a soft ball 
it is ready to take from the fire. Beat it till smooth and 
creamy, then stir in two cups of broken pecan meats and drop 
from a teaspoon in small piles upon paraffine paper. 

POPCORN WAFERS 

Make a receipt of boiled icing. Stir in fresh popcorn 
that has been buttered and salted. Have long wafers. Pile 
on the com till it is nearly an inch thick ; set in the oven and 
brown to a light color. 

CHESTNUTS CANDIED OR MARRONS GLACES 

Parboil eighteen or twenty large French chestnuts till the 
skins rub off easily. Then put in hot water and simmer till 
tender. Dissolve a cup of sugar in a cup of water, and add 
the tender chestnuts. Move them carefully so they will not 
break. Let them cook in the hot symp till clear, then take 
them out. Next boil the syrup till it hardens on being 
dropped in cold water, take from the fire, and add half a 
dozen drops of lemon- juice. Put in the chestnuts, turn 
them about till they are coated with the syrup and drain on 
oiled paper. 



330 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

STUFFED DATES 

Purchase the finest dates for this sweetmeat, and after 
separating them wipe each one carefully with a bit of damp 
cheesecloth. Make a cut the entire length of a date and re- 
move the stone. Fill the cavity with a blanched almond or an 
English walnut. Sprinkle the palms of the hands with pow- 
dered sugar and roll the date to its original form. Leave 
the dates in powdered sugar until ready to serve. 

FRUIT CANDY 

Cut half a pound of figs in small pieces, add a tablespoon 
of grated chocolate and two pounds of sugar and enough water 
to dissolve the sugar. Cook all together till it creams, and 
then add, after taking from the fire, three-quarters of a pound 
of seeded dates and the meats of a pound and a half of En- 
glish walnuts. Stir all together till grains appear, and then 
spread in oiled pans and set to cool. Cut in squares when cold. 

CANDIED ORANGE RINDS 

Orange rinds left from breakfast you may convert into 
a dainty confection. Cut them in strips, carefully removing 
the bitter white part. Boil them in hot water till quite tender. 
To a cup of sugar add four tablespoons of water, cook to the 
crackling point and drop in the orange strips and cook five 
minutes longer. Set away to cool, leaving the rinds in the 
syrup. When cool drain the rinds on a sieve, dip in granu- 
lated sugar, and dry on oiled paper. 

SALTED NUTS 

Almost any large-meated nuts — ^pecans, almonds, filberts, 
peanuts, or English walnuts — ^may be salted. Buy pecans and 
walnuts shelled, as it is very difficult to remove them from the 
shells entire. A pound of shelled walnuts at forty cents a 
pound is really cheaper than when unshelled at twenty cents. 
Peanuts and almonds are more economical purchased un- 



CANDY, CANDIED FRUITS, SALTED NUTS 331 

shelled. Obtain peanuts that are unroasted. Remove the 
skins by pouring boiling water over them — a process which is 
called blanching — then dry thoroughly. For a pound of nuts 
pour half a cup of olive oil id a spider. When hot, put in one 
cup of the nuts and shake gently over a brisk fire till they 
begin to brown delicately. When all are evenly browned, lift 
the nuts on a skimmer, drain as much oil from them as possible 
and toss on a sheet of white blotting paper. Dust liberally with 
fine salt. Do not salt nuts longer than twenty-four hours 
before they are eaten.

THE ART OF PIE-MAKING 

ALTHOUGH many esteemed authorities on dietetics have 
placed their ban of displeasure upon the pie-eating habit, 
declaring it to be at all times conducive to ill health, yet the 
fact remains that in many homes pies are freely consumed. 

It is not the purpose of this article either to extol or to con- 
done the consumption of pastry, but to give explicit directions 
for making the very best quality of this, if questionable, 
nevertheless delectable, variety of sweets. To make crisp, 
palatable pastry the work must be done in a cool place, the 
materials which enter into its composition must be of the best, 
thoroughly chilled, put together quickly, with as little contact 
during the whole process with the hands and fingers as is prac- 
ticable. All hard kneading must be avoided if light paste is 
desired. 

The best paste is obtained by using equal portions of butter 
and lard for shortening. When butter alone is used, except 
for puff paste, the crust will be tough. All lard produces ten- 
der paste, but it is white and tasteless. When freshly made 
butter can not be had, wash the butter thoroughly and knead 
in several successive waters. 

To mix properly the dough for pastry, first sift the salt — 
of which very little should be used — with the flour, then by 
means of a knife cut the shortening into the flour. To one 



PIES AND PASTRIES 333 

accustomed to use the hands for this purpose the operation 
will be awkward; but experience will overcome this, and the 
result justifies the extra trouble. 

When the flour and shortening are incorporated, add, a 
few drops at a time, just enough ice water or very cold water 
to cause the ingredients to adhere, being careful to avoid hav- 
ing wet streaks. Do not knead, but turn the dough, which has 
been lightly gathered into a round heap, on to a well-floured 
doughboard, or marble slab if procurable, and divide into Cwo 
parts, one for the upper, the other for the lower crust. 

Flour the rolling-pin, which should be straight — ^that is, the 
same size at the ends as in the middle — ^then, with light but 
effectual strokes, roll into shape. The strokes must always 
be from the worker, and the pressure must be even. The top 
icrust must have airholes in it, else it will burst. 

The paste will be lighter if, after mixing, it is stood in the 
ice-box or other cold place for two hours or more before 
baking. 

One of the banes of the pie-maker is the soggy under crust. 
To prevent this, bake, but do not brown, the bottom crust 
before putting in the filling. Further, upon removing from the 
oven do not take out of the baking tin until ready to serve. In- 
stead, stand on an inverted teacup. The air will circulate be- 
neath and dry the under crust. A trial of this method will 
convince the sceptical. Perforated pie-tins are the most satis- 
factory. If these can not be had use granite ware. 

Perhaps, after all, the success of the pie depends more upon 
the baking than upon any other step in the whole process. The 
materials may be the choicest and skilfully combined, yet if the 
oven be too slow the paste will not rise, but become white and 
clammy. In this many cooks may find an answer to the puzzle, 
why their pies never look fresh and flaky. On the other hand, 
if the heat be too brisk and the paste browns before it has time 
to rise, it will have a rancid taste. 

It will, therefore, be seen that the temperature of the oven 
is a matter of much moment to the successful pastry cook. 
The fire should be made long enough beforehand for the

heat to have a ''body/' Test before putting in the pies t>y 
baking a bit of crust. 

A good^ formula for proportions for family pastry is: To 
three cups of sifted flour, to which a little salt is added, use 
one cup of shortening. If half a teaspoon of baking powder 
is used three-fourths of a cup of shortening will suffice. This 
is sufficient for four ordinary pies. The amount may be in- 
creased or diminished provided the propotUbns are kept. 

PIECRUST 

Before making your piecrust, put some lard into a bowl, 
on this lay a good-sized piece of ice and cover with water. 
Set on the ice, or in some very cold place, for twenty min- 
utes or half an hour. At the end of that time put into a pan 
a slightly heap ing teaspoon of salt and one Sj 
01 siilCil"41uUl'. Vo this add two heapmg tablespoons of the 
lard 'you' have in the ice water. Cut this lard through the 
flour with a knife, or mix quickly with the tips of the fingers. 
Pour over enough of the ice water to roll easily (which you 
can ascertain by pressing your finger on the pastry), mix with 
a spoon, turning over and over until all is mixed. Then 
sprinkle the pan you have mixed it in with flour,' lay your 
paste back in it, and set on the ice, or in some very cold place, 
twenty minutes. Have your pie-plate ready^ grea§fi,^xfi]Cy. . 
lightly, then sprinkle flour Over tt;"'Then^prinklefl<wir rather 
thickly on the pastry board, HbufTfTeroIImg-pin, cut a piece __ 
of dough and lay on the board. Spriilkle flour over the dough, 
give it one roll out flat, beat it once, fold over the four cor- 
ners, sprinkle with flour and roll again quite thin. Double 
the piece you have rolled just in the middle, lay it double on 
the pie-plate, then turn the folded half back, fit it to the pie- 
plate, giving plenty of room for it to fall into place. Trim 
the edges with a knife that has been dipped into the flour. 
Put the fruit on the pastry. Now roll the upper crust in the 
same way. Fold, flour, roll, and beat twice. Roll the upper 
crust thicker than the under :crust. Double it exactly half over 



PIES AND PASTRIES 835 

and cut several gashes in the centre. Lay this in the same 
position on the pie, turn over the upper half, giving room 
for it to fit, and trim the edge as before. Handle the pie- 
crust as little as possible, as the heat of the hand will make 
it heavy. In rolling, roll from you — and roll only one way. 
The baking is the most important. Heat the oven hot. Judge 
of the heat by trying a small piece of the dough. If the 
crust is baking too fast, set a pan of cold water in the upper 
oven to cool it at once. Turn the pie around two or three 
times that it may bake evenly. When done, and perfectly 
cold, sprinkle powdered sugar over the upper crust. The 
quantity directed will make one large pie. 

PUFF PASTE 

To make puff paste that is light and flaky requires, be- 
sides the knowledge how, an infinite amount of patience and 
a certain adroitness or, one might say, sleight of hand, which 
only comes with experience. 

The secret lies in securing the greatest number of alter- 
nate layers of butter and dough. To accomplish this there 
must be sufficient butter to form these layers before it is ab- ( 
sorbed into the dough. If too much butter is used it will 
not be absorbed ; consequently the paste will be heavy, greasy, 
and unpalatable- '^~' 

Many cooks allow equal weights of flour and butter for 
piiff paste. Experience has proved that equally good results 
may be had by using three-fourths of a pound of butter to 
one pound of flour. Xhe butter, which must be fresh and 
sweet, should hardfen in ice water before it is used, and then 
be divided into four equal parts. 

Sift the flour into a bowl which has been thoroughly 
chilled, cut up one of the lumps of butter in it, then wet with 
a little ice water. When a dough is tl^tftformed, turn upon 
a marble slseb, dust with flour and roll in^Ri strip about twelve 
by six inches. Flour the remaining portions of butter and 
roll into strips eight by five inches. Mix half a teaspoon of 



r * 



836 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

cream of tartar with twice its bulk of flour, ^rinkle each 
strip of butter with the mixture, lay one on the strip of 
dough and roll up. Let stand fifteen minutes in a cold place 
to prevent the butter from oiling, then roll out» lay on an- 
other butter strip, roll up, set aside to chill, and so proceed 
until all the butter is incorporated with the dough; then roll 
into shape. 

This variety of paste is especially suitable for tarts and 
pies having no top crust In summer, it should be made the 
day before baking, then put into a closely covered pail and 
stood in the ice-chest. 

PREPARING FRUITS FOR PIE 

Apples should be peeled, sliced thin and sugared to taste 
before being put in the piecrust. Peaches should also be 
peeled and sugared. But if the peaches are small they may 
be cooked in the pie with their pits, which give an added flavor. 
Raspberries, blackberries, cherries, currants should be dusted 
with flour as well as sweetened before being put in the 
crust. Gooseberries and cranberries should be stewed and 
sweetened before being put in their piecrust. 

To all these fruits a tablespoon or two of cold water 
should be added. In the fruit pies use fruit generously. 
That is, have plenty of the fruit filling, which wholesomely 
serves as an antidote to the rich pastry. 

APPLE PIE 

Peel and slice good flavored tart apples. Judge of the 
quantity you will need by slicing them into the pie plate you 
will use, heaping them to allow for loss in cooking. After 
slicing rinse quickly in cold water, put in a saucepan with a 
little water and two tablespoons or more of sugar. Cook 
until the apples are a little tender. Take them off, put the 
apples on the lower crust, and whatever juice is required. 
Then put on the upper crust, and bake. When done, take 
out the pie and with a broad-bladed knife loosen the upper 



PIES AND PASTRIES 887 

crust, and lay over entirely on to the table. Put into the pie 
a tablespoon of butter, and sugar to taste, and gently mix 
the ingredients through the apple with a silver knife. Nut- 
meg may be added if liked, but no other spice. Be careful 
not to touch or break the under crust Return the cover 
to the pie, and when cold and ready for use sift powdered 
sugar over the top crust. If you serve the pie hot, pour cream 
over it; or serve it plain. 

CHERRY PIE 

Have soar, ripe cherries pitted. Pits may be left in a 
few to give their flavor. Prepare your crust on the pie 
plate, pinching the edge up high. Then lay in very gen- 




Chcrry Pitter 

erously the cherries, putting in first a layer of the fruit and 
then sugar till you use a cupful. Over the top sprinkle a 
tablespoon of flour and lay on the upper crust. Pinch it 
down well round the edges, for cherries are juicy, and the 
juice bofls over. Cut the upper crust in the middle to give 
vent to steam, and bake in a hot oven. 

CREAM PIE 

Blend a cup of sugar with one pint of cream. Stir in the 
beaten whites of tour eggs and a quarter of a nutmeg grated- 
This pic should have but a lower crust. ,, .

838 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SOUR CREAM PIE 

Beat one egg into a cup of sour cream. Add one cup of 
chopped and seeded raisins, and bake between two crusts. 

DRIED FRUIT PIES 

Dried peaches, apricots, prunes, cherries, apples, and 
other fruits are used for pies. In getting the dried fruit 
ready, wash quickly in warm water three times. Then cover 
the fruit with fresh cold water and let it stand and soak over- 
night. Next morning stew in the water in which it soaked 
till tender. Then sweeten and spice to taste, and lay upon 
the piecrust. A tablespoon of butter spread over the fruit 
improves its flavor. Dried fruit pies are commonly baked 
with an upper crust. Sometimes they are without an upper 
crust and are covered with a meringue — ^which is made by 
beating to a froth the whites of two eggs, adding and beat- 
ing in two tablespoons of sugar, and setting in a moderate 
oven to brown after it is spread over the pie. 

LEMON PIE— DOUBLE CRUST 

Grate the rind and take out the pulp of one lemon and 
extract the seeds. Carefully chop the pulp fine in a granite 
pan, as a wooden chopping bowl would absorb the juice. 
Add the juice to the chopped lemon. Mix in a saucepan 
one teacup of sugar, one teacup of water, and one tablespoon 
of flour dissolved in water, and stirred smooth. Set the 
saucepan in another of hot water, and stir constantly until 
the mixture boils, stirring until it thickens. Then take off 
and pour over the lemon. Stir all together, and when cool 
add one beaten egg. Bake in a deep pie plate, with both an 
upper and under crust. This will make one pie. 

LEMON PIE— UNDER CRUST 

From two large lemons grate the rind and squeeze the 
juice. Blend with the juice the yolks of four eggs, three 



PIES AND PASTRIES 839 

cups of sugar, five tablespoons of flour or cornstarch, and 

two cups of water. Add the grated rinds and stir in the 

beaten whites just as you pour into the crust. Bake with only 
an under crust. 

LEMON MERINGUE PIE 

Stir one heaping teaspoon of flour into one cup of sugar. 
Into the yolks of three eggs stir the juice and grated yellow 
of a lemon. Mix the lemon and sugar parts and add half a 
cup of cold water. Put in the crust and bake, and when 
baked cover with a meringue made of the whites of the eggs 
beaten with a little sugar. After putting on the meringue 
let the pie stand a few moments in a moderate oven. 

CHOCOLATE LEMON PIE 

Bake two crusts. Into one put a rich lemon filling. Next 
put on the other crust, right side up, and fill with a mixture 
made by cooking until thick and creamy one and one-half 
cups of powdered sugar, five tablespoons of grated chocolate, 
and vanilla extract to flavor. Cover with white and chocolate 
meringue. [See illustration, Plate XXVII.] 

MINCEMEAT 

Boil until tender a fresh beef tongue of good size. For 
this mincemeat use half of it. The half you use free from 
skin and chop very fine. Also chop fine a pound and a half 
of fresh beef suet and a pound and a half of good tart baking 
apples. To these ingredients add two pounds of currants 
washed clean and dried, half a pound of raisins seeded, half 
a pound of sugar, quarter of an ounce of mace, quarter of 
an ounce of grated nutmeg, an eighth of an ounce each of 
cinnamon and cloves, and half a pint of brandy. When you 
put this meat in the" crust lay on top of it before putting on 
the upper crust little pieces of candied citron and orange. 






840 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

ORANGE PIE 

Grate two good-sized oranges, yellow, pulp, all except the 
leathery centre skin. Add to them a cup of sugar, the 
yolks of three eggs, and three tablespoons of thick cream. 
Bake with only one crust Make a meringue of the whites 
of the eggs beaten stiff with a little sugar, spread over the 
fire and set in a moderate oven for a few minutes. 

POTATO PIE 

Rub through a colander one pound of potatoes. Let the 
hot potato fall from the colander on quarter of a pound of 
butter. Mix and add one pound of sugar beaten together 
with the yolks of six eggs. Stir this into the potato, and 
add the grated rind and juice of one lemon. Last stir lightly 
through the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Line 
two deep pieplates with the piecrust, pour in the filling and 
bake. 

PUMPKIN PIE 

To prepare the pumpkin peel and cut it in pieces about 
an inch square. Pour into a granite or porcelain kettle 
one pint of cold water. Add the pumpkin and cook slowly 
for five hours, to allow some of the water to cook away. 
Have ready a crock, set a colander over it and pour in the 
pumpkin. Let this drain off overnight. Next day press the 
pumpkin through the colander with a potato masher. It 
takes half a large pumpkin to prepare this. For the pies 
take three cups and a half of pumpkin, one full teaspoon of 
salt, three beaten eggs, two even teaspoons of ginger, half 
of a grated nutmeg, one iron spoon of molasses, one heaping 
tablespoon of butter, one cup of milk, and half a cup of 
cream. In preparing pumpkin for a pie, the quantity of milk 
needed will vary according to the quality of the pumpkin. 
A good pumpkin will thicken as the milk is added. A poor 
one will be thinner, and so much milk can not be used. The 
receipt here given is for a good pumpkin. It is always well 



PIES AND PASTRIES 341 

in any case to make the mixture for the pie thick. This 
given quantity will make two pies. Line a pieplate with pie- 
crust, trim off the edge with a knife dipped in flour. Pour 
in the mixture full to the top. Bake in a moderately hot 
oven, and slowly, as pumpkin pies need to be very well done. 
If the pastry is baking too brown, set a pan of warm water 
over the pie in the upper oven, 

PHILADELPHIA PUMPKIN PIES 

To one pint of stewed pumpkin which you have mashed 
through the sieve or colander add two pints of cream, the 
beaten yolks of twelve eggs, and two grated nutmegs. Add 
also one teaspoon of mixed powdered spices, two cups of 
sugar, the juice of two lemons, and the whites of eggs 
beaten to a froth. 

This is for Thanksgiving and Christmas pies. 

RAISIN PIE 

Stem and cleanse a pound of raisins and let them simmer 
one hour in water enough to cover them. Take from the 
fire, cool and stone. Add the grated rind and juice of one 
lemon, a cup of sugar, two tablespoons of flour dissolved in 
a little of the raisin water, and the rest of the raisin water. 
These pies have an upper and under crust. 

RHUBARB OR PIEPLANT PIE 

Unless you have stalks young and exceedingly tender, 
begin by stripping off the skins of the stalks. Then cut the 
stalks in pieces half an inch long. Cover a pie tin with crust, 
pinching the edge up high. Strew over it thick pieces of 
pieplant mixed with sugar, allowing to a cup of the rhubarb 
a cup of sugar. Sprinkle over all a tablespoon of flour and 
add a tablespoon of cold water. Lay on the upper crust 
after you have cut centre vent holes, pinch down well to keep 
the juice in, and bake in a well-heated oven about half an 
hour. 



342 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

RHUBARB MERINGUE PIE 

Cut rhubarb into thin slices; measure a coffee cup heap- 
ing full. Beat the yolks of two eggs with half a cup of sugar, 
one tablespoon of flour, and one-fourth of a cup of water. 
Mix with the rhubarb. Turn into a pastry-lined pie tin and 
bake in a moderate oven until the crust is done and filling 
well set. Beat the whites of the eggs until stiff, add two 
tablespoons of pulverized sugar and beat again. Heap 
roughly over the top of the pie while hot. Set back in the 
oven to brown delicately. Serve cold. 

GREEN TOMATO PIE 

Slice green tomatoes, put in an earthen saucepan, and 
sweeten with equal quantities of sugar and New Orleans 
molasses, and no water. Cook over moderate heat until the 
tomatoes are clear. Line a pie plate with paste, lay the to- 
matoes in it, and cover them with the syrup. Cut two slices 
of lemon in small pieces, and mix in with the tomatoes. 
Sprinkle flour thickly over the top. Put a rather thick crust 
over and bake. When the pie is cold sprinkle over with 
powdered sugar. 

ALMOND STRAWS OR TARTS 

Sift together and thoroughly mix one pound of pastry 
flour, one teaspoon of salt, and one teaspoon of baking powder. 
Blanch and pulverize half a pound of almonds. Mix the 
almonds with the flour ingredients and work in half a cup of 
shortening made half of butter and half of lard. Mix with 
ice water as in making common pastry, cut in the shapes you 
wish, and bake in a hot oven. 

CHEESE BISCUIT 

Roll puff paste thin and grate a fine American cheese upon 
it until it is thickly covered. Over the cheese dash cayenne. 
Fold the paste on itself and roll out thin. Cut in the form 



PIES AND PASTRIES 843 

you wish, brush with a brush dipped in the beaten white of 
an egg, and bake a light brown in a quick oven. 

CHEESE STRAWS 

Mix together with your hand half a pound of flour, five 
ounces of butter, five ounces of grated American cheese, two 
eggs, a pinch of mustard, and salt and pepper to your taste. 
When you have this in a smooth dough, lay it on your pastry 
board and roll it out thin, have it say a fifth or a sixth of an 
inch thick. Cut it in straws four or five inches long, and 
bake on tin plates in a quick oven till a golden brown. 

CREAM HORNS 

Roll out puff paste until it is very thin. Then cut it in 
long strips and wind it round floured irons or sticks, which 
must be round. Wind the paste so that its edges will meet. 
Or if you prefer wrap it so that it will have a corkscrew 
form. Bake until thoroughly done, and when the paste is 
cold slip it from the forms. Fill in with flavored whipped 
cream, or with preserves or jellies. To glaze the horns brush 
with the white of an egg, dust with sugar, and set in the 
oven till the glaze forms. [See illustration, Plate XXVIII. ] 

FIG TARTS 

Put one pint of figs in a pint of hot water and let them 
gently stew almost three hours and a half. Use an earthen- 
ware or porcelain-lined saucepan. If the water boils out 
add enough hot to keep the figs stewing. When nearly 
cooked add a cup of sugar, and when you take from the stove 
add the juice of a good-sized lemon. Have ready some tiny 
shells of puff paste and into these drop the figs. If you wish 
to cap the figs with whipped cream, drop a spoonful on each 
fig filling. But the tarts will be rich enough without the 
cream. 

PASTRY FRUIT CAKES 

Roll pastry scraps left from making pies or puffs into a 
thin sheet and spread thick with chopped dates, raisins, nuts, 



844 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

figs, or any such fruits you have at hand. Lay another thm 
sheet of the pastry over the filling, press lightly, cut into 
shapes with a biscuit or sandwich cutter^ and bake till a golden 
brown. 

PUFF PASTE PATTIES 

[See lUutimtioa, Plite XXVIII.] 

Wash half a pound of butter in a bowl of ice water till 
it becomes elastic and creamy. Put it into a long strip and 
lay it on ice- Sift half a potmd of flour three times, adding 
half a teaspoon of salt, and then add g^radually half a cup 
of ice water. Mix well. Work the dough by slapping it on 
your mixing board or marble paste slab, and use your rolling- 
pin to pound it till it blisters. Chill the dough by laying it 
near ice for fifteen or twenty minutes. Next put it on your 
board and make it in a form a trifle larger and wider than 
the strip of cold butter. Lay on the strip of butter evenly 
and fold the flour dough over upon it, folding all four sides 
of the dough upon the butter. Upon a little sprinkled flour 
turn over the dough so that the butter side will be down, 
and roll out carefully. Do not break the dough and let the 
butter out. Fold the flat sheet threefold and set it by ice a 
quarter of an hour to chill. Next roll twice, fold again, and 
again put by ice to chill. Repeat the last directions. Finally 
roll out and chill before cutting into patties. Brush the under 
piece of the patty with ice water. Cut a piece the size of a 
half dollar out of the second piece, then lay the piece on the 
first and brush all with the yolk of a beaten egg. Set the 
patties near ice for an hour. Then bake in the lower part 
of a hot oven from twenty to thirty minutes. PuflF paste 
scorches easily, and must be carefully baked. It is put in 
the hot oven thoroughly chilled, and the sudden change of 
temperature helps to puff it up. But if the oven is too hot, 
the paste browns before it puffs, and so becomes heavy and 
not puff paste at all, but a brown, greasy crust. 

This paste is used for holding all kinds of fruit preserves, 
and also creamed oysters, sweetbreads, and chicken.

THE BOON OF AN APPLE BARREL 

THE housewife who has been careful to add to her winter 
Stores a barrel of apples, for all winter long — ^almost till 
strawberries are cheap — has the wherewithal for most whole- 
some and appetizing dishes. It is better economy, no matter 
if the family is large, to purchase only one barrel in the fall. 
At intervals during the winter, when another barrel is re- 
quired, it may cost more, only one has to take into considera- 
tion the fact that in the ordinary furnace-heated cellar the 
lasting quality of apples is impaired. Better pay the cold stor- 
age man fifty cents for having kept them safely than throw 
away a dollar's worth of rotten fruit. If you are lucky enough 
to possess a cool vegetable cellar, it is economy to store away 
several barrels of apples late in the fall, when they are at their 
cheapest. New clean barrels and a cool calcimined cellar, 
with plenty of ventilation, are necessities, however. 

THE CARE OF APPLES 

The fruit should be examined once a week, being handled 
very carefully to prevent bruising. It is an excellent plan 
to keep an empty barrel for this purpose. Two or three 
decaying apples will speedily taint the flavor of a whole 
barrel, or make them rot. The fruit which is only 
slightly spoiled may be culled out, heaped in a peach basket 
and cooked at the earliest convenience. If you are a house- 



846 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

holder of the East, buy greenings, Baldwins, or russets ; they are 
the best-keeping winter apples. The Ben Davis and wine saps 
are two varieties most successfully stored in Western cellars. 

The professor, skilled in the science of food chemistry, 
tells us that apples contain gluten, albumen, pectine, fibrine, 
sugar, starch, malic acid, tannic acid, as well as water and 
traces of free salts. This all means little to the housewife un- 
skilled in chemistry; she only realizes that, in some subtle 
fashion of her own. Nature has stored away in the apple such 
a wealth of healthfulness and spicy flavors as is bestowed on 
few of the fruits of the tropics. It is full of the elements es- 
sential to the building up of sound tissues and the making of 
good blood. When eaten raw it is at its best. Every day pick 
the choicest apples from the barrel, polish with tissue paper, 
and pile in a pretty dish. Accustom the children of your house- 
hold to apple eating ; as a rule it is an easy task. When a meal 
is over, remove the apples to a cool pantry; they lose much 
flavor and crispness when left standing in a heated dining- 
room. 

The old adage, which said "Apples are gold in the morning, 
silver at noon, and lead at night,'' has been set aside by latter- 
day authorities on nutrition. They assure us that apples eaten 
raw are gold at night, because they excite the action of the 
liver, promote sound and healthy sleep, and prove excellent 
brain food. 

COOKED APPLES 

When one turns to the cooking of apples, first of all we 
think of wholesome apple sauce and delicious baked apices. 
For tried and true receipts for such wholesome fare, see the 
following pages and apple receipts among "Puddings." This 
is but a glance at the manifold uses of our most useful of fruits. 

APPLES AS SALAD 

Besides making most appetizing desserts, apples serve to 
help out the daily menu in many ways. Cut in cubes mixed 
with shredded oelery and a few wabut meats and smotfictcd 



STEWED FRUITS 347 

with a boiled dressing, sour apples form the base of the eat- 
cellent Waldorf salad. [See "Salads," page 161.J 

APPLE FRITTERS 

Sliced, dipped in a batter, fried in deep fat, and served with 
a sweet sauce, they are delicious as fritters. 

APPLE SAUCE 

Of necessity, apple sauce does not always await the en- 
trance of roast pork. It is good all winter long, for breakfast, 
luncheon, or supper, and it proves a most welcome variation 
to the housewife who sees her canned fruit supply running 
low. Apples for any cooking purpose should always be pared 
with a silver knife; steel will spoil their color. For apple 
sauce, cook them in a tightly covered granite or white-lined 
saucepan. Take it from the fire as soon as the fruit is tender, 
sweeten, and serve warm. Do not sweeten if the sauce is to 
be served with pork. If you would have the finest possible 
flavor, put the apples with a very little water and sugar in a 
clean bean pot, set it in a hot oven, and bake. The sauce will 
have a rich red color and a most excellent taste. 

CIDER APPLE SAUCE 

Sometimes toward the approach of spring apples grow 
flavorless. Add to them — in any way they are cooked — a dash 
of lemon or orange juice, half a cup of grated pineapple or a 
few spoons of quince preserve. The addition of raisins, halved 
dates, or a little finely chopped orange peel often transforms 
plain apple sauce into a very attractive dish for the children's 
table. We must not forget the spicy, old-fashioned cider apple 
sauce, which is a good standby all winter long. Simmer down 
to a pint one quart of cider and add to it four quarts of sliced 
apples. Cook till tender, flavor with a bit of lemon peel, if 
desired; beat to a smooth cream, pour into stone jars, cover 
when cool, and set away in a dry cold place. This sauce may 



348 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

be made in a large quantity. It will keep perfectly till warm 
weather. See also "Apple Butter" following. 

APPLE BUTTER 

In a porcelain kettle boil down six quarts of cider till it 
measures four quarts. Have half a peck of fine, easy cooking, 
juicy, sweet apples. Peel, core, and slice as many of the 
apples as the cider will cover and drop them in the boiling 
cider. When the apples are tender, take them out with a 




Apple ParcT 

skimmer, and lay in a stone crock. Do exactly the same 
^ith the re^ of the half peck of apples. Pour the cider over, 
stir up from the bottom, and let stand overnight. The next 
morning put all together in the kettle, and slowly cook down 
till you have a jam or butter consistency. Be sure your heat 
is only moderate, for the butter must not burn. Put in bottles 
or jars and seal 

TO BAKE SOUR APPLES 

When baking apples do not remove the skins, even if it 
does not give the dish so sightly an appearance. Next to the 
skin lies the aromatic portion of the fruit. It is lost in paring. 
Choose the largest apples for baking. Wipe them clean, ar- 



STEWED FRUITS 840 

range in a granite or earthen dish, pouring a little water over 
and sprinkling with brown sugar. Bake in a moderate oven 
till soft^ and jcook to the core. Allow two or three hours if 
necessary. Turn occasionally during baking so they will cook 
evenly. 

TO BAKE SWEET APPLES 

Proceed as in the foregoing receipt, omitting the sugar. 

To turn a dripping-pan or other dish over the dish in which 
the apples, whether sweet or sour, are baking, helps them to 
cook by keeping in the steam, and gives an added flavor. 

Baked sweet apples are delicious served with sweet cream 
poured over them. 

FRIED APPLES 

Fried apples add zest to a dish of sausage or pork chops. 
See "Fried Apples and Pork," page 123. Wash the apples, 
slice them without peeling, and put them in a frying-pan, the 
bottom of which is liberally covered with hot drippings or 
butter. Cover tight, and let them cook till soft over a mod- 
crate fire. Stir occasionally. Serve hot. 

NEW ENGLAND PAN DOWDY 

Years ago, when eggs were a luxury — not even obtainable 
at sixty cents a dozen — ^the apple desserts of our grandmothers 
called for no eggs, yet their goodness can scarcely be sur- 
passed to-day by the woman whose pride is fancy cooking. 

Pan dowdy was always made in a deep yellow baking dish. 
The dish was liberally buttered, the bottom and sides were 
lined crust-fashion with slices of buttered bread. It was filled 
with sliced apples, dusted with nutmeg or cinnamon, moistened 
with half a pup of hot water, one cup of brown sugar, and 
two tablespoons of molasses. Finish with a top crust of 
liberally buttered bread, cover with a plate, bake slowly for 
an hour and a half. Serve turned out on a platter and with 
cream or hard sauce. 



350 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

STEWED DRIED APRICOTS 

Wash in three cold waters one pound of dried apricots. 
Put into a crock and cover them with cold water, which will 
be near one quart. Soak overnight. Next morning put into 
a good-sized preserving kettle w^ith the water in which they 
have soaked. Add three pints more of cold water and one 
heaping teacup of sugar. After they begin to boil, stew them 
steadily and slowly one full hour and a half. The richness 
of fruit comes by slow boiling. Dried fruits are improved 
by stewing a long time, and gently. 

These directions may be followed and the sugar omitted 
if a sour apricot sauce is wished. 

STEWED CRANBERRIES 

Take one quart of cranberries, wash them in cold water, 
pour this off and put them in a porcelain-lined saucepan and 
pour over enough cold water barely to cover them. Stir in 
one small teaspoon of soda, without dissolving it in water. 
When the berries boil the soda will foam. When it stops 
foaming, add one teacup of sugar. Boil slowly, and when the 
cranberries are half done, mash them with the back of a 
spoon. Let them continue to boil about one hour,, and when 
clear and rich they are done. Pour out into a crock or large 
bowl, and stir once in a while to prevent a scum forming 
over the top. 

BAKED PEARS 

. A JEWISH RECEIPT 

Peel the pears and stick a couple of cloves in each pear. 
Put in an earthenware baking dish, sweeten to your taste, 
add water to afford plentiful juice in baking, and bake in a 
moderate oven till the pears are tender. Dip up the water in 
the pears now and then as they are baking. 

STEWED DRIED PRUNES 

Select a pound of medium-sized prunes. Wash them in 
three cold waters. Put them in a crock and cover with cold 



STEWED FRUITS 851 

water overnight In the morning put them in a preserving 
kettle with the water they were soaked in. Add two more 
quarts of cold water, one full teacup of sugar, one sliced 
lemon. Cook slowly until there is more than enough juice to 
cover them, as they will absorb the juice after they are done. 
It will take two hours to cook them slowly. 

TO STEW PRUNES WITHOUT SUGAR 

Wash the prunes thoroughly in several waters, cover with 
cold water and boil or simmer slowly until tender. They will 
haye a thick s)rrup juice, and if of a good quality will have 
considerable sugar in themselves and be quite sweet enough 
for some tastes. 

STEWED QUINCES AND APPLES 

Peel and cut three quinces in small sections. Cover them 
with plenty of water (without sugar) and cook until nearly 
tender. Save the peeling and cores, put them in another 
saucepan, cover well with water, and stew until the flavor of 
the quince has cooked into the water. Cut good flavored 
apples in small sections and add to the stewed quince. Strain 
and add, the water in which the peelings and cores have 
boiled. Cover the mixed apples and quinces with water, 
sweeten to taste, and cook until the apples are rich and clear. 
Another way of flavoring apples is to boil ginger root with 
them, taking out the root when they are su£&ciently flavored 
and adding several slices of lemon. 

STEWED RHUBARB 

Peel the rhubarb and cut it in inch pieces. Lay it in a 
large crock, wash quickly in cold water, and then cover with 
boiling water. Let it stand fifteen minutes, and pour off 
this water. Put it in a preserving kettle, and add a teacup of 
sugar to four cups of the fruit. Add no more water, as rhu- 
barb is very juicy. Let it stew steadily until clear and rich. 
Taste carefully, and sweeten only just enough to leave a slight 
acid.

SELECTION OF FRUIT 

IN canning fruit, if the work be done successfully, there are 
three important considerations: the condition of the fruit, 
the process employed, and the storing. 

The fruit must be fresh, of fine flavor, without bruise or 
blemish, and not over-ripe; for, contradictory as it may ap- 
pear, the moment fruit reaches the point of perfect maturity 
it begins to deteriorate in quality. It is a prevalent but mis- 
taken notion which many economy-loving women hold, that 
the canning season should be delayed until fruit is at its 
cheapest. If taste is valued, first fruits should always be 
obtained for this purpose. 

As the acme of flavor and the highest nutritive properties 
lie nearest the rind, the most delicious fruits and those which 
keep longest are canned without being pared, after a careful 
washing and whisking with a stiff brush made for the pur- 
pose. If pared fruit is preferred, the thinnest possible rind 
should be removed with a silver knife, which does not dis- 
color, and the fruit plunged at once into a wooden or earthen 
vessel of cold water, as exposure to the air will darken it

CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 868 

BOILING 

Such fruits as peaches, pears, and the like, which harden 
when dropped into boiling syrup, should be cooked in clear 
boiling water until tender, then transferred, using .a wire 
spoon, to glass jars — ^standing conveniently to hand in a pan 
of warm water — and the boiling syrup, clear as crystal, poured 
over them. Only enough fruit to fill one can should be 
cooked at a time. Fruit put up in this manner retains both 
flavor and shape, thereby being delicious to eat and good to 
kM>k upon. Of course, it necessitates a little more time than 
to dump the fruit wholesale into a kettle and cook all at once, 
but to the woman who is satisfied with none but the best re- 
sults in her culinary work, it is time well spent. 

A very good proportion for the syrup is a pint of granu- 
lated sugar to a quart of water. Use only a porcelain-lined 
or granite kettle. Put in the sugar, pour over the water, stir 
until dissolved, then put to code. Bring slowly to boil, and 
skim thoroughly before adding to fruit. Make only enough 
for two jars at one coddng. 

STEAMING 

Another method of canning the firmer sorts of fruits, one 
which ensures satisfactory results, is steaming. Line the 
bottom of a steamer with a clean white cloth, then put in a 
small quantity of prepared fruit; cover closely, and stand 
over a kettle of boiling water, which must be kept boiling 
without cessation until the fruit is tender, but not soft; then 
lift out, a piece at a time, and drop into boiling syrup ; cook a 
moment, fill cans, pour over syrup and cover closely, but 
do not seal. Let stand a moment to settle, uncover, fill up 
wiA boiling syrup, wipe away all moisture from lids and 
rim ; then seal at once, taking pains to have the rubber show 
an even edge all around. 

On no account should berries intended for canning stand 
overnight. They ferment rapidly, even when kept in a cool 
place, become soft and mash in codcing. To the neglect of 



854 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

this precaution may be traced many a failure. If such fruit 
must be utilized, make it into jam. 

Unless necessary, do not wash berries. Pick off stems 
and leaves with care to avoid bruising — for when the skin 
of the fruit is broken the syrup will be discolored. As berries 
are by nature soft and mash easily when cooking, they should 
be cooked with the sugar, which has a tendency to make 
them firm. 

SMALL FRUITS 

The finest way to put up berries and other small fruits is 
as follows: Sprinkle with sugar in the proportions of half a 
pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Then fill into glass 
jars. Put on the lids of the jars, but not the rubber rings. 
Fit a board into the bottom of a wash-boiler; wrap each 
jar in a clean towel or cloth, to prevent touching, then stand 
them in rows in the boiler. Fill the boiler with cold water 
to within half an inch of the tops; bring the water to boil 
and continue boiling for fifteen minutes. Remove jars, wipe 
dry, fill up from a can set apart for the purpose, and seal 
without delay. Berries canned in this way will be whole, 
firm, and retain their natural flavor. 

Having selected one's fruit with care, then complied with 
the rules governing the cooking and sealing, the last but by 
no means least weighty consideration is the storing. 

STORING 

The fruit closet has three arch-enemies which, singly or 
combined, will play havoc with its stores. These are heat, 
light, moisture. The closet must have a dry situation, for 
moisture induces mould; light working on the fruit genders 
an acid which no amount of sugar will overcome, and heat 
will cause fermentation. 

WINTER PRESERVES ^ -, 

In mid-winter, empty fruit jars and jelly tumblers begin 
to accumulate, and the housewife looks with dismay at gaps 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 856 

on the shelves of her preserve closet. The stock, which must 
be made to spin out till fresh fruit is in plenty, may be added 
to occasionally, however, even when the markets display noth- 
ing but apples, oranges, grapefruit and cranberries. The pos- 
sibility for mid- winter preserves 'is by no means limited, and 
the result is sometimes quite appetizing. The British cook 
realizes the goodness of oranges as a preserving fruit; the 
orange marmalade set before one with hot rolls at a real Scotch 
breakfast table is a combination not readily forgotten. 

APPLE JELLY 

If you own a barrel of apples and they begin to spot 
slightly, as even the best apples will do during the winter, it 
is economy to pick them over frequently and use all the specked 
apples for jelly. Pick out with a sharp knife every morsel of 
decay, then wash the apples well in cold water, rubbing them 
with a cloth; for winter stored apples have a faculty for ac- 
cumulating dirt. Cut the fruit into thin slices, using both 
* cores and skins. To each quart of apples add one pint of cold 
water, and set in a kettle over the fire in a large preserving 
kettle. If the apples are rather flavorless, add one lemon, 
finely sliced, to two quarts of apples. Stir frequently to pre- 
vent the fruit from burning. When it is reduced to a mush, 
pour it into a jelly bag of crash or flannel which has been 
wrung from hot water. Hang it to drain for twenty-four 
hours in as warm a place as possible. There is a large amount 
of gelatinous substance in apples. When gelatine is chilled, 
of course it solidifies, so if a jelly bag cools before the juice 
has run out quite an amount of it is lost. An excellent winter 
method for jelly making is to keep the bag suspended as near 
as possible to a hot register. Allow for each pint of juice one 
pint of sugar. Set the juice to boil for twenty minutes and 
put the sugar to heat in a moderate oven. After the boiling- 
down^ process is done, pour in the heated sugar, when the 
bubbling will scarcely be interrupted. Pour it in heated tum- 
blers after five minutes' cooking. Leave it to cool, then cover 



356 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

with parafiine. One secret of quick and perfect jellying is to 
have everything which conies in contact with the juice quite hot. 

APPLE GINGER 

Pare two and a half pounds of sour apples, core and chop 
them coarse. Put in a saucepan with a pound and a half of 
brown sugar, the rind and juice of one and a half lemons, 
half an ounce of ginger-root and one cup of cold water. Let 
the fruit come to boil, then set back on the stove where it will 
merely simmer for four or five hours. Stir occasionally to keep 
it from burning. Put hot into jars and seal. 

BLACKBERRY JAM 

Blackberry jam is made after the same receipt. Take one 
quart of berries from each gallon. Heat them and strain the 
juice, adding it to the berries and thus avoiding too many seeds. 

BRANDIED CHERRIES 

AND OTHER FRUITS 

Have perfectly ripe, but not over-ripe, sound, sweet 
cherries. Keep their stems by cutting them short, or carefully 
free the fruit wholly from stems. Drop the cherries, a few 
at a time, in a boiling syrup made of a pint of water and 
half a pound of sugar. When they have boiled three to five 
minutes, lift out and Ijiy them on plates. Allow to cool and to 
dry as they cool. They should be perfect in form. Make a 
second syrttp twice as sweet as the first ; that is, use a pound 
of sugar to a pint of water. After the syrup boils clear, set it 
aside to cool. Carefully pack the cherries in glass jars. To 
the cooled second syrup add its same liquid measure of the 
best brandy. Pour the mixed syrup and brandy over the 
cherries in the jars, seal, and set in a dry, dark, cool fruit closet 

Other fruits may be brandied by this receipt 

CRAB-APPLE JELLY 

Choose red-skin crabs. Wash, cut off all spots and blem- 
ishes, and quarter, keeping the peel and the cores. Put in a 



CANNED FRUItS AND PRESERVES 357 

preserving kettle with enough water to rise in sight. Boil 
gently till the apples are tender and falling to pieces. Put in 
a jelly bag — ^preferably a flannel bag — and let the juice drip 
into an earthen bowl. If you squeeze the pulp the jelly will 
be cloudy. Measure the juice by pints and allow a pound of 
sugar to each pint. Simmer at the bubbling point a full twenty 
minutes. Then put in the sugar, which you have weighed and 
heated. Cook five minutes at a bubbling point. If you test 
on a saucer you will find the syrup a jelly. If by any inad- 
vertence or inaccuracy it is not a jelly, cook longer. Finally put 
in jelly glasses while hot. After the jelly hardens, lay on top 
brandied paper and cover tight. Keep in a cool, dry, dark 
place. 

CRANBERRY CATSUP 

If the catsup supply is running low, replenish with a de- 
licious substitute made from cranberries. Cook together ten 
pounds of the berries, one quart of vinegar, five pounds of 
brown sugar, three tablespoons of cinnamon, two tablespoons 
of allspice, one tablespoon each of cloves and salt, and quarter 
of a teaspoon of cayenne. Boil slowly till thick, then strain 
and bottle. 

SPICED CRANBERRIES 

This abundant winter fruit makes an excellent relish 
when spiced. Boil together three and a half pounds of brown 
sugar, two cups of vinegar, two tablespoons each of ground 
cinnamon and allspice, and one tablespoon of ground cloves. 
When this has been cooked to a syrup, add five pounds of 
cranberries. Simmer slowly for two hours. Put away in a 
covered stone jar. 

RAISIN AND CRANBERRY JAM 

Seed one cup of fine plump raisins, put them to stew in a 
granite saucepan with one quart of cold water. When the 
liquid is reduced to one pint, add four cups of cranberries and 
two and a half cups of sugar. Simmer very slowly till the 
cranberries are thoroughly cooked, then can and seal. 



368 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SPICED CURRANTS OR OTHER FRUIT 

To eight pounds of the fruit take four pounds of sugar 
and one pint of vinegar. In an earthen preserving kettle 
heat together the vinegar and sugar. Add a tablespoon each 
of powdered cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Have your 
fruit in perfect condition and cleanliness. Stir in the S3rnip 
and cook till done. Set in tumblers or jars and seal. 

CURRANT JELLY 

Free the currants from leaves, but do not take from the 
small stems. Examine carefully for insects and then wash in 
cold water. Drain thoroughly, and afterward stew the cur- 
rants in a porcelain preserving kettle till they are cooked to 
a soft mass. Tip into a colander. Press through, and then 
strain twice through a thick bag — preferably a flannel bag. 
Boil fifteen minutes, and then to each pint of juice add a 
pound and a quarter of granulated sugar which you have well 
warmed. Do not plump the sugar in all at once, but stir in a 
little at a time. When the sugar is thoroughly stirred in, the 
juice is at the jelly point. If you have doubts, test it; and if 
necessary, cook a little more. Pour into glasses and set to cool. 
When cold, cover with brandied paper or paraffine, and also 
glass or metal cover. 

FIG MARMALADE 

To every two pounds of fresh ripe figs allow a pound and 
a half of sugar and the grated yellows and juice of a large 
lemon and a large orange. Cut the figs in small pieces and 
boil with the orange and lemon, often stirring them, till you 
have a thick, smooth marmalade. Put away in jelly glasses 
and jars with paraffine covering over the top. 

PRESERVED FIGS 

This preparation is more of a confection than a preserve. 
It is delicious, and affords at a moderate price a dainty which 
costs extravagantly when bought at a grocery. Buy the finest 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 869 

dried figs, pull them apart and wipe each one with a piece of 
wet cheesecloth. Weigh them and set aside their weight in 
granulated sugar. Soak the figs overnight in cold water, then 
simmer very slowly in just enough water to cover them. Lift 
them out carefully and set to cool. Make a syrup from the 
water in which they were cooked and the sugar. Put the figs 
back in the syrup, adding a few bits of green ganger, the juice 
of two lemons and the rind of one to one pound of figs. 
Simmer for ten minutes, drain off the figs, set them to dry 
slightly in a moderate oven, and boil the syrup till quite thick. 
Put the figs in glass jars, pour the syrup over them and seal 
while hot. 

SPICED GOOSEBERRIES 

Head and taiU three quarts of gooseberries. With a little 
water to cover the bottom of the kettle stew them a few 
minutes till their fibre is relaxed. Then add one pint of 
vinegar, a quart and a half of sugar, a teaspoon of ground 
cloves, two tablespoons of ground cinnamon, half a tea- 
spoon of white pepper, and half a teaspoon of salt. Use a 
porcelain kettle, and boil the fruit and the syrup thirty or 
forty minutes over a slow fire. Seal in bottles or glasses 
for use. 

SPICED GRAPES 

Pulp the grapes. Boil up the pulp till the fibre softens 
and loosens the seeds. To every three quarts of skins and 
pulp add the syrup described in the foregoing receipt, 
namely, a pint of vinegar, a quart and a half of sugar, a 
teaspoon of ground cloves, two tablespoons of ground cin- 
namon, half a teaspoon of salt, and half a teaspoon of white 
pepper. In a porcelain kettle gently boil all these ingredients, 
allowing thirty to forty minutes for a complete, slow cooking. 
Put in bottles, seal, and set in the fruit closet for use. 

GRAPE JELLY 

Choose grapes just turning ripe. Pick from the stems and 
cook in a preserving kettle, allowing a cup of water to each 



3«0 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pound of grapes. Whai the grapes are cooked soft, put in a 
jelly bag and let the juice drip in an earthen bowL If you 
squeeze the bag the jelly will be cloudy. Cook the strained 
juice about twenty minutes. Then add a pound of warmed 
sugar to each pint of juice. Simmer at a bubble five minutes, 
skim and put in jelly glasses while hot. After the jelly cools, 
lay over paper dipped in brandy, and seal. 

CITRON MELON PRESERVE 

Ptel and slice the melon thin, or in small quarters. To 
every pound of citron allow one pound of sugar and quarter 
of a pound of ginger-root. Put the melon in water enough to 
cover, add to this water two teaspoons of soda, boil until just 
tender, and set to cool. When cold, soak in a strong alum 
water one hour. Make a syrup of one pint of water and two 
pounds of sugar. Beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth, 
add this to the sugar and water, stir, let it boil, and skim off 
the egg. As the egg clears the sugar and water add the 
ginger-root and melon and cook in this syrup until clear. Put 
in glass jars (not too full), and .cover with the syrup. 

ORANGE JELLY 

Slice oranges very thin. Put in preserving kettle and 

cover with cold water. Boil for two hours. A delicately 

tart jelly will be obtained. After boiling the water and pulp, 

^. pour it into a strainer lined with cheesecloth and let the liquid 

^ drip. To one pint of juice add one pint of heated sugar. Boil 

^ till a drop will jelly when poured on a cold plate. Put into 

glasses and cover with paraffine. 

ORANGE JUICE AND YELLOW 

First be sure your oranges are clean, then wash and wipe 
them dry. From a quarter of them grate off the yellow skin. 
Roll them all upon a board under the hand, halve them, and 
squeeze out all the juice. Put the grated yellow, and measure 
the orange- juice, into a porcelain-Uned fruit kettk. Set over

CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 861 

the fire^ and when it begins to boil, add as much sugar as you 
measured of the juice. GxDk slowly till the juice thickens and 
put in glasses and seal. 

ORANGE-AND-LEMON MARMALADE 

Wash in cold water^ scrubbing the skins with a vegetable 
brushy one dozen sour oranges and six lemons. Dry them 
and cut oS the ends, then slice very thin on a vegetable £;utter. 
Pick the seeds from this pulp and put them to soak in two 
ctsps of cold water. Put the pulp in a large preserving kettle, 
cover with one gallon of .cold water and let it stand for thirty- 
six hours. Then strain the seeds, add the water from tiiem to 
the shredded fruit and set the kettle to boil slowly for two 
hours. Add ten pounds of sugar and boil for another hour 
en- till it jellies. Pour into tumblers, and when cool cover 
with melted para£5ne. This marmalade, if made when oranges 
sell for twenty-five cents a dozen, costs about four cents a 
tvunbler. If you desire a more decided tang of acid to this 
preserve, use four grapefruits instead of six oranges, and 
make the marmalade after exactly the same rule. 

MIXED MARMALADE 

Crush two pounds and a half each of currants and pitted 
cherries. Add two pounds of seeded raisins, the yellow peel 
of lour oranges chopped fine, and three pounds of sugar. Cook 
gently till the fruit is a marmalade, adding a little water if 
needed. Add the Juice of the oranges just before the marma- 
lade is ready to leave the slove. Cook ten minutes after putting 
in the juice. 

GINGER-ROOT PEARS 

In a preserving kettle steep in two cups of water quarter of 

a pound of green ginger-root, or half a pound of candied 

ginger-root, after cutting it in small pieces. Add eight pounds 

of sugar and let boil to a syrup. Cut the inside of four lemons 

in small pieces and add to the syrup. Cut also and add the 

lemon rinds — ^not the white part, but strips of the thin yellow

skin. Take eight pounds of peeled pears, slice the fruit, and 
add. Cook very slowly until all is thick like a jelly. 

SPICED PEARS 

Take one teaspoon of whole cloves, one tablespoon of all- 
spice and one tablespoon of cinnamon. Crush them slightly, 
and boil one minute in a quart of vinegar and a pint of sugar 
mixed. Select a fine variety of pear, halve, taking out the 
seeds, and boil in water until nearly tender. Finish the cook- 
ing in the spiced syrup, cooking them not too soft. Place them 
in small stone jars and cover well with the syrup. Tie a 
cover over the jar. 

SPICED PEACHES 

Spiced peaches are made the same as spiced pears, except 
they are not boiled in water. The syrup will cook them 
sufficiently. 

PEACH MARMALADE 

For marmalade, take half a peck of very ripe yellow free- 
stone peaches and half a peck of white freestones. Pare, 
stone, and weig^ them, allowing three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to each pound of fruit. Put one pint of water in the 
bottom of the kettle before the fruit is added. Add the peaches 
and stand on the stove where it is not too hot, to draw their 
juice, stirring from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Set an 
asbestos plate under to keep from scorching. When the juice 
is well drawn out, boil hard until the mixture pops and sinks. 
Then add the sugar which has been heated quite hot. Beil 
until thick and not too stiff, which will be from half to three- 
quarters of an hour. Put in glasses or jars and cover over 
with brandied paper or paraffine. 

SPICED BLUE PLUMS 

Rinse in cold water, and wipe dry, two pounds of blue 
plums. Prick each one. Boil one minute one pint of vinegar. 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 863 

with one pound of sugar, one tablespoon of whole allspice, one 
tablespoon and a half of stick cinnamon, and one dessertspoon 
of cloves, having crushed the spices slightly and tied them in 
a lace bag. Lay the fruit in a stone jar. Pour the hot vinegar 
over it for nine mornings, heating it each day. The last 
morning, boil the plums in the spiced vinegar twenty minutes. 
Damsons are spiced in the same way. 

TO PRESERVE PUMPKIN FOR WINTER USE 

Wipe off and cut open the pumpkin and take out the seeds 
and soft network within. Cut into half moons, and trim off 
tfie hard outside rind. Then cut the meat in smaU pieces, put 
in a steamer over a kettle of boiling water, cover tight by 
laying a weight on the cover, and steam slowly three or four 
hours, or until the pulp or meat is perfectly tender. Then 
put tbnough a icolander. Next put the pumpkin pulp in a 
kettle, set it over a very slow, gentle fire — in this have cane, 
lor pttmi^dn bums easily — and heat the pumpkin hot, and dry 
it out. While it is still hot put it in glass battles or cans, seal 
tight, and set it in the fruit closet for use. 

GRATED QUINCES 

Grate your quinces, and to each cup of grated fruit add 
two and a half cups of sugar and two cups of water. Boil 
slowly for an hour or more and seal in jelly glasses. 

RAISIN JAM 

Wash seedless raisins. To each pound allow one cup of 
oold water, and simmer gently ovy the fire for an hour. Then 
add a cup of sugar to each pound of raisins, and also a sliced 
lemon. Simmer again for an hour, put in glasses, cover with 
parafiine, and set away for use. 

BLACK RASPBERRY JAM 

Crush half of your berries, heat in a preserving kettle, and 
then put through a sieve. Add the juice to the other whole 



864 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

berries, let come to boil, add quarter of a 4>ound of sugar to 
each box of berries, and simmer till the jam is thick. Put 
in small glasses or jars, cover with parafiine, and set in a dry, 
cool, dark place for use. 

RED RASPBERRY JAM 

To six boxes of red raspberries add five pounds of sugar 
and the juice of four lemons. Cook slowly together in a pre- 
serving kettle and put away in small glasses or jars, sealed or 
covered with parafiine. 

STRAWBERRY JAM 

For every pound of fruit allow half a pound of sugar. Put 
the berries in a preserving kettle. Stand the kettle back on 
the stove where it is not too hot, to draw out the juice. When 
the juice is well drawn, bring forward and let boil until the 
berries pop and sink, stirring occasionally. Have the sugar 
hot, add to the berries, and stir almost constantly with a 

fpoden spoon. Let boil until quite firm without being stiff, 
hich will be from Tialf to thfee-qtiarters of an hour. Set an 
asbestos plate under to prevent the fruit burning. Put away in 
jelly glasses or jars, cutting a paper to fit the top and wetting 
it with brandy. 

SUN PRESERVES 

For cherries, strawberries, gooseberries, red raspberries, 
currants; etc., take two pounds of fruit to two pounds of sugar. 
Prepare the fruit and have it in perfect condition. Melt the 
sugar in a preserving kettle by adding just enough water to 
moisten it and let it boil ^ip clear. Then add the fruit and let 
boil two minutes. Pour into platters and shallow earthen 
dishes, and set in the hot sunshine two or three days. Bring 
in the preserve each night ; that is, do not let dew or dampness 
get to it. Put away in jelly glasses or jars. 

TOMATO JAM 
5eel seven pounds of tomatoes and let them lie in a jar in 
one quart of vinegar overnight. Next morning put them in an 




.^ 



CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 865 

earthen preserving kettle and boil. When nearly done, add 
three and a half pounds of sugar, two teaspoons of cinnamon, 
one teaspoon of cloves, and two teaspoons of mace. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI 

Put into a large stone jar or crock with a closely fitting 
cover one quart of good preserving brandy. For every pound- 
of fruit which you use as you proceed you must add three- 
quarters of a pound of granulated sugar. You must use only 
the best of dry, good fruit in sound condition and of choice 
flavor. Every kind of fruit may be used, commencing with 
strawberries. The mixture must be-stirred every day with a 
large wooden spoon in order that the sugar may be well dis- 
solved. The jar must be kept in a dry, cool place. Use as 
much of any kind of fruit as you may desire, remembering the 
proportionate quantity of sugar, beginning with strawberries 
and the sugar, follow on with cherries, pineapples, currants, 
raspberries, apricots, plums, peaches, grapes, peeling and seed- 
ing all of the fruits except the berries. Use at least one pound 
of black cherries as a dark coloring, always remembering ac- 
curacy as to the proportionate amount of sugar and the daily 
stirring.

SWEET PICKLES 

EVERY storeroom should have an assortment of sweet 
pickles. They are boons to the housewife; not only be- 
cause they are such acceptable appetizers for lunch-basket, 
luncheon, and tea tables, but also because they may be trans- 
formed into many delightful emergency dishes suitable for 
an entree or a dessert. 

A pickled peach or pear, or a bunch of pickled cherries 
in a pastry shell, dressed with a little spiced liquor, makes a 
most toothsome morsel. Plain cake and sweet pickled fruit 
combine so agreeably that they seem made for each other. 
Several varieties of pickled fruit may be served together as a 
spiced fruit salad. These are but three of the many dishes 
which may be concocted by using the sweet pickle as a basis. 
Others will suggest themselves. 

SYRUP FOR SWEET PICKLES 

Any fruit or vegetable that can be preserved may be made 
into sweet pickle. A very good proportion for the syrup is 
three pints of "coffee C" sugar to one quart of good cider 
vinegar. The spices commonly used for this variety of pickle 
are cloves and cinnamon, and the proportion two teaspoons 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 867 

of the former and four tablespoons of the latter to each gallon 
of fruit. 

The appended receipts if followed to the letter can not fail 
to give satisfactory results. 

SWEET APPLE PICKLES 

Sweet apples may be prepared in the way directed for 
"Sweet Pear Pickles," and are especially nice. 

SWEET BEET PICKLES 

Cook the beets till tender; slip off the skins and cut into 
slices; place in glass jars, fill up with spiced syrup, boiling 
hot, and seal. 

SWEET CANTALOUPE PICKLES 

Select melons that are not quite ripe; open, scrape out 
the pulp, peel, slice, and lay in a weak brine overnight. Next 
morning boil in a weak alum water till transparent; lift out, 
drain, wipe dry, then drop into boiling spiced syrup and cook 
twenty minutes. 

SWEET PEACH PICKLES 

Take four quarts of peaches of a gentle acid flavor and 
tender fibre. Peel, but do not stone. In a porcelain kettle 
boil a quart of cider vinegar with four pounds of sugar, a 
tablespoon of mace, a tablespoon of cloves, and a tablespoon 
of cinnamon broken small. Tie the spices in a bag of thin 
muslin, or if you prefer, tie the other spices and stick the 
cloves through the meat of the peaches. When the cider 
boils, drop in the peaches, and when they all boil up, skim 
and boil six minutes. Gently take the peaches from the 
syrup, lay them in the bottom of a crock. Boil the syrup 
fifteen minutes longer, pour over the peaches, cool and cover 
tight, and keep in a cool place. 



^ 368 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

SWEET PEAR PICKLES 

Pare and halve the fruit; then drop it into boiling syrup, 
and cook until tender enough to pierce with a silver fork. 
Transfer to a stone jar, sprinkle with spices, cover witfi 
boiKng syrup, let stand overnight; next morning finish as 
directed for "Sweet Peach Pickles." 

SWEET DAMSON PLUM PICKLES 

Scald together the vinegar and sugar; skim, add spices, 
boil up once, then turn over fruit. Draw off and scald the 
vinegar twice more at intervals of three days, the last time 
boiUng the fruit twenty minutes. 

SWEET PRUNE PICKLES 

Soak a day in cold water after washing thoroughly two 
pounds of prunes. Then steam them till they are soft and 
tender. In an earthen kettle make a syrup of a pound of 
f sugar, half a pint of vinegar, half an ounce of cinnamon 

^ and cloves, and a couple of pinches of ginger if your taste 

directs, but the ginger may be omitted. When the syrup 
boils, add the primes and boil together fifteen minutes. 

SWEET STRAWBERRY PICKLES 

Place the berries in layers in a jar with spices between. 
Pour over them the boiling syrup. Let stand twenty-four 
hours closely covered ; then draw off the syrup, boil and pour 
over the fruit again. Let stand as before, then turn the whole 
into a preserving kettle and cook slowly, without stirring, for 
I thirty minutes. Pickle other small fruits in the same manner. 

SWEET WATERMELON PICKLES 

Select a fine ripe melon; pare off the outer green rind and 
red core. Cut into inch squares, and place in a preserving 
kettle with two teaspoons of salt for each gallon of rinds. 
Nearly cover with water and boil until tender. Drain in a 
colander ; then proceed as directed for "Sweet Peach Pickles." 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS S69 

HOME-MADE CATSUPS 

The various catsups are highly appreciated by the good 
cook, who not only employs them for the purpose of impart- 
ing an agreeable flavor to meats and other solid foods at 
table, but also as a piquant seasoning for soups, gravies, meat 
sauces, hashes, stews, and similar dishes. 

To buy these condiments ready prepared and of a de- 
sirable quality one must needs pay a fancy price; but when 
manufactured at home, their cost is insignificant. 

Use only perfect fruit for catsups; cook in a porcelain 
kettle ; bottle in glass or stone. 

To prevent mould, do not fill the bottles quite to the top 
with catsup, but fill up with hot vinegar. 

CUCUMBER CATSUP 

Peel and chop three dozen cucumbers and half 4is many 
onions very fine. Add one teacup of mustard-seed, a quarter 
of a teacup of black pepper, and one ounce each of cloves and 
allspice. Mix well and cover with vinegar. 

CURRANT CATSUP 

Cook together until thick six quarts of currant- juice and 
five pounds of sugar. Then add one quart of vinegar, three 
tablespoons of cinnamon, two of allspice, one each of cloves, 
nutmeg and salt, and half an ounce of cayenne. Boil twenty

GOOSEBERRY CATSUP 

Scald, mash and put through a colander nine pounds of 
ripe fruit. Add five pounds of sugar, three tablespoons of 
cinnamon, and half a tablespoon each of cloves and allspice. 
Boil twenty minutes, add one quart of cold vinegar, bottle, and 
seal without delay. 

RIPE GRAPE CATSUP 

Make ripe grape catsup by the same formula as "Goose- 
berry Catsup."

a crock, and cover with hot weak vinegar. 



374 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

PEPPER MANGOES 

Select the long sweet peppers. Cut a long slit in the side 
of each. Very carefully tnt out the centre with a small pen- 
knife, not touching the seeds. Rinse in cold water and lay 
in strong salt and water twenty-four hours. Rinse in cold 
water at the end of that time, drain, and wipe dry. Fill the 
peppers with the following dressing: Cabbage and onion 
chopped fine, and separately. Use twice as much cabbage as 
onion. Season with black and white mustard seeds, celery seed, 
and chopped horseradish, moistened with a small quantity of 
vinegar and olive oil. After filling, sew together the opening. 
Put in a jar, and cover with cold vinegar.

to three-quarters of an inch in length until you have one 
quart. Add one quart of white onions cut small, one quart 
of green tomatoes, four large sweet peppers, one quart of 
small cucumbers, and one large head of cauliflower. All these, 
except very small cucumbers, are cut in small pieces. Put 
into a brine made of one gallon of water and a cup of salt, and 
stand twenty-four hours. Then scald in the same brine, and 
drain well. For the mustard dressing, mix one cup of flour 
with two cups of sugar, six tablespoons of ground mustard, 
one tablespoon of tamarack, and two quarts of cider vinegar. 
Scald all together, and the pickles are ready for use. 

NASTURTIUM SEEDS 

Keep a glass jar of cider vinegar in a cool place, and 
drop in the seeds of your nasturtium flowers — ^when the seeds 
are full formed and green, but not when they have become 
hard and yellow. These pickled seeds are an excellent sub- 
stitute for capers in making sauce for boiled mutton. 

PICCALILLI 

Take as many green tomatoes as you wish, and one-fourth 
as many onions. Slice and put in layers, sprinkling two 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 375 

tablespoons of salt over every third layer. Let stand over-

BOILED COFFEE 

PUT into the coffee-pot three-quarters of a teacup of ground 
coffee. Mix this with one teacup of cold water. For 
settling it, use a piece of dried codfish skin two inches square, or 
one-quarter of an egg, the yolk and white mixed together (not 
beaten). Stir in a piece of the shell. Add two teacups of 
boiling water. Set it on the stove and boil hard ten minutes, 
covering the pot tight. Stir the coffee down from the sides 
as it rises. When it is done, it will no longer rise. After 
boiling it quickly, set it back on the stove and boil ten min- 
utes more. When this is done, pour in one-quarter of a tea- 
cup (scant) of cold water to settle it. Keep hot to serve, 
and boil no more. A good way to keep an3rthing hot is to set 
an asbestos plate underneath, back from the fire. Otherwise 
the cooking will continue. 

TO CLEAR COFFEE 

Two things are good for clearing coffee, one is tgg, the 
other is the skin of a salt codfish. The codfish clears coffee 
much better than egg. Take a salt codfish, peel off and dry 
the skin in a warm place. When dried, cut into pieces about

two inches square. When you have mixed your coffee with 
cold water, throw into it a piece of the skin, and add Uk 
boUing water, and hoL There will not be any Savor of the

DRIP COFFEE 
Allow one tablespoon of ground coffee to one cup of boil- 
ing water. Put the ground coffee in the strainer of a French 
eoffee-pot. Slowly pour the boiling water, half a cup at a 



time, over the ground coffee. Cover the pot ti|^ between tint

a second time. Take the strainer from the pot. Carry the 
coffee to the taUe boiling hot

In the strainer of a drip coflfee-pot put findy ground 
coffee, allowing two tablespoons of coffee to one cup of boil- 
ii^ water. Pour fresh boiling water over the coffee, let stand 
a moment and then serve. To ensure getting the strength of 
the coffee, be sure the coffee is finely ground and the water 
is boiling hot. 

TURKISH COFFEE 
Have fresh-roasted coffee ground to a fine powder. In 
a small coffee cup put a heaping teaspoon of the ground coffee 



378 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

and a lump of sugar, or sugar to your taste. Fill up the cup 
with boiling water, stirring as you pour in the coffee, so 
that the boUing water will touch all the powder. The 
grounds are drunk with the liquid. The strength of this 
cup may be increased by doubling the quantity of the ground 
coffee. 

TO MAKE TEA 

Scald an earthen teapot and put in one teaspoon of tea for 
each cup you will need, allowing one teaspoon for the teapot 
Pour in fresh boiling water, not water that has boiled some 
time, but water that has just begun to boil. Stand in a warm 
place five minutes for the leaves to steep, not on a hot stove, 
but on a water tank or other warm place where the teapot is 
kept warm. Serve a slice of lemon with each cup, or cream 
or milk. 

COOL BEVERAGES FOR SUMMER DAYS 

One always associates tinkling ice and crystal with warm 
weather, and there is nothing more appreciated by the 
weather-worn and thirsty than a homemade, cooling, non- 
intoxicating beverage. 

Summer drinks should be served from crystal pitchers 
and in thin glasses. One can buy such pretty articles in 
pressed glass nowadays that heavy earthenware receptacles 
and thick, inartistic glasses are out of place and inexcusable. 

The simplest lemonade tastes better when sipped through 
straws. A box of one hundred straws may be purchased for 
a small sum, and they are well worth the investment. 

Iced tea is a favorite beverage for summer tables, but the 
receipt given here is as unlike that usually masquerading 
under this title as black is from white. 

ICED COFFEE 

For icea coffee to serve in the afternoon or evening make 
the coffee in the morning. Sweeten to taste, and set to cool. 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 879 

Put a tablespoon of cracked ice in each glass in which the 
coffee is served, and drop a spoonful of whipped cream on 
top of each glass of the beverage. 

ICED TEA 

Fill thin glasses full of shaved ice, placing a thin slice of 
lemon on top of each and also one teaspoon of powdered sugar. 
Make a pot of strong tea and pour into the glasses over the 
ice. There will not be any danger of breaking them, as the 
ice cools the tea immediately, and herein lies the secret of the 
delicious flavor obtained. [See illustration, Plate XXIX.] 

SUMMER COCOA 

Mix a heaping teaspoon of cocoa with the same quantity 
of sugar in enough boiling water to dissolve both cocoa and 
sugar. Fill the tumbler with fresh cold milk or with thin 
cream. 

ICED COCOA 

Boil a heaping teaspoon of cocoa in half a pint of boiling 
water for five minutes. Sweeten to taste and add after it is 
cool half a cup of cream. Beat light with an egg beater, and 
serve in tall glasses half filled with powdered ice. 

LEMONADE 

To every glass allow one small lemon, or a large lemon 
to two glasses. Squeeze the juice, add a glass of water for 




Lemon Squeezer 

each glass, and sugar to taste. Put the pitcher on ice and serve 
thoroughly cold, but not with ice in the glass. 



S60 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

APOLLINARIS LEMONADE 
Use ice-cold apollinaris water instead of common water, 
follow the directions just given, and serve as soon as made. 

SHERRY LEMONADE 
Take a large-sized tumbler, fill three-quarters full of 
pounded ice, add the juice of one large lemon, two teaspoons 
and a half of sugar, one tablespoon of sherry, and fill up with 
water. Stir all well together. 

EGG LEMONADE 
Squeeze a small lemon in a tumbler. Add sugar to your 
taste, being careful to keep the driok a little sour. Break an

fresh water, cap the ttmibler with a shaker, hold very firm to- 
gether, and shake vigorously. When the egg is broken com- 
pletely and mingled with the liquid, the lemonade is ready 
to drink. 

THE MAKING OF FRUIT SYRUPS OR SHRUBS 
Appreciation of delicious fruit flavors proves a stnxig in- 
centive to the zealous housewife in providing herself a^inst

\ 



the day when the possibility of securing the fruit itself shall 
have passed. 

The making of fruit syrups entails no excess«Df time, labor, 
or expense, and the syrups are valuable in autumn and winter 
desserts, flavoring home-made ice creams, sherbets, jellies, 
Bavarian and other creams^ sauces for puddings, and also 
flavorings for punch«s and other beverages. But especially 
they are in this division given as serving for wholesome and 
delicious flavoring in a glass of fresh water. In using the 
syrup for such simple beverages, use it precisely as our grand- 
mothers did — have a tumbler of fresh water and stir in a table- 
spoon of the syrup, or "shrub," or "vinegar," as those dames 
of other days used to say in speaking of such sweets. 

CHERRY SYRUP 

Have ripe, juicy acid cherries. Stone them, and one-eighth 
of the stones pound and break. Cook all together till the 
cherry pulp is soft and the juice free. Then squeeze through 
a bag. To every pint of juice add a heaping cup of sugar and 
boil fifteen minutes. Put in bottles or jars and seal for use. 
Keep in a cool, dry place. 

CHOCOLATE SYRUP 

Add to three tablespoons of chocolate one pint of boiling 
water. Let boil up, then add one pint of sugar and boil three 
minutes. When cold add one tablespoon of vanilla. In using 
the syrup put two tablespoons in a tumbler, add two table- 
spoons of cracked ice, two tablespoons of whipped cream 
and fill up the glass with milk. Stir well together, and serve. 

CURRANT SHRUB 

Allow a pound of sugar to every pint of currant- juice and 
boil slowly in a porcelain kettle. When it has boiled ten 
minutes set to cool, and when barely lukewarm add a wine- 
glass of pure brandy to every pint of syrup. Bottle and seal 
and keep in a cool, dark, dry place. 



S82 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

• GRAPE SHRUB 

Crush ripe grapes in a stone jar, and cover with good 
cider vinegar. Cover the jar tight and leave overnight. Every 
day for three or four days stir and press the grapes and the 
vinegar together. Finally, strain through a cheesecloth folded 
three times, and to every three quarts of mice allow five pounds 
of sugar. Stir tmtil the sugar dissolves. Then boil, skim, and 
bottle while very hot. 

LEMON SYRUP 

Grate Ae yellow off eight fine lemons. Squeeze out the 
juice and put in a porcelain kettle with two cups of water, 
the grated yellow, and four pounds of sugar. Boil all to- 
gether five minutes. Then strain through a bag to get out 
the yellow. Boil up once more, and then bottle and seal 
for use. 

PINEAPPLE SYRUP 

Make a S3rrup of three pounds of sugar to which has been 
added the white of an egg beaten up and gradually blended 
with a pint of cold water. Let boil and skim until the whole is 
very clear. Put aside to cool. Carefully pare and grate pine- 
apples of the best quality, obtaining three pints of juice, and 
strain the same through a flannel jelly-bag. Put the syrup on 
to boil for about ten minutes, adding gradually at the end of 
this time the pineapple-juice. Let all come to boil together, 
skim well, and place aside to cool. When thoroughly cold, 
bottle, cork, and seal. 

RASPBERRY SYRUP 

Mash gently freshly gathered raspberries and put into a 
stone crock with half a pint of the best white wine vinegar to 
every pound of fruit Cover carefully and plaj;e on a shelf 
in the cool cellar for a couple of days. At the end of this 
time allow all the juice to drain off thoroughly through a very 
fine puree sieve, without any attempt, however, to wash the 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 383 

pulp of the berries through the sieve; this may be used for 
making jam. Add to every quart of juice a pound and a half 
of the best granulated sugar, stirring with a wooden spoon 
until the sugar is wholly dissolved, when stir in briskly the 
well-beaten white of an egg to which has been added a table- 
spoon of cold water. During this process the mixture may 
be heated, but not allowed to come to boil, and then set aside 
to cool. Then again put over a more brisk flame of the gas 
range and allow to boil for about five to ten minutes. Skim 
well as the scum rises, and, when removed from the fire, stir 
until cool. When cold, bottle and seal. 

STRAWBERRY SYRUP 

Put on over a moderate flame of the gas range a porcelain- 
lined kettle, containing three potmds of sugar and one and 
a half pints of water. Stir with a wooden spoon until the 
sugar is dissolved. Allow to .come to boil, skim, and set aside 
to cool. Mash fresh ripe strawberries and strain through a 
cheesecloth bag to produce three and a half pints, or a scant 
two quarts of juice. Put the kettle containing the boiled sugar 
and water over a flame of greater intensity, and let boil rap- 
idly, watching for the moment when a spoonful of this syrup 
dropped into cold water and rubbed between the thumb and 
finger will form a small ball. Add at once the strawberry 
juice. Let all come up to boil, skim, and set aside to cool. 
When cold, bottle and seal. 

GRAPE-JUICE 

Use only clean, sound, well-ripened but not over-ripe 
grapes. If an ordinary cider mill is at hand, it may be used 
for crushing and pressing, or the grapes may be crushed and 
pressed with the hands. If a light-colored juice is desired, put 
the crushed grapes in a cleanly washed cloth sack and tie up. 
Then either hang up securely and twist it or let two persons 
take hold, one on each end of the sack (Fig. i), and twist 
until the greater part of the juice is expressed. Then g^adu- 



384 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

ally heat the juice in a double-boiler oi>a large stone jar in a 
pan of hot water^ so that the juice does not come in direct con- 
tact with the fire, at a temperature of i8o° F. to aoo° F.; 
never above 200^ F. It is best to use a thermometer, but if 
there be none at hand, heat the juice until it steams, but do not 
allow it to boil. Put it in a glass or enameled vessel to settle 
for twenty-four hours ; carefully drain the juice from die sedi- 
menty and run it through several thicknesses of dean flannel, 
er a conic filter made from woolen cloth or fdt may be used. 
This filter is fixed to a hoop of iron, which can be suspended 
wherever necessary (Fig. 2). After this fill into clean bottles. 
Do not fill entirely, but leave room for the liquid to expand 
when again heated. Fit a thin board over the bottom of an 
ordinary wash boiler, set the filled bottles (ordinary glass 




Fig. I. — Pressing Out Grape-Juice by Haod 

fruit jars are just as good) on it, fill in with water round the 
bottles to within about an in.qh of the tops, and gradually heat 
until it is about to simmer. Then take the bottles out and 
cork or seal immediately. It is a good idea to take the further 
precaution of sealing the corks over with sealing wax or 
paraffine to prevent mould germs from entering through the 
corks. Should it be desired to make a red juice, heat the 
crushed grapes to not above 200** F., strain through a clean 
cloth or drip bag, as shown in Fig. 3 (no pressure should be 
used), set away to cool and settle, and proceed the same as 
with light-colored juice. Many people do not even go to the 
trouble of letting the juice settle after straining it, but reheat 
and seal it up immediately, simply setting the vessels away in 
a cool place in an upright position where they will be undis- 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD

turbed. The juice is thus allowed to settle, and when wanted 
for use the clear juice is simply taken oflF the sediment Any 
person familiar with the process of jcanning fruit can also pre- 
serve grape juice, for the principles involved are identical. 

One of the leading defects so far found in unfermented 
juice is that much of it is not clear, a condition which very 
much detracts from its otherwise attractive appearance and is 
due to two causes already alluded to. Either the final steriliza- 
tion in bottles has been at a higher temperature than the pre- 
ceding one, or the juice has not been properly filtered or has not 
been filtered at all. In other cases the juice has been sterilized 





Tig. a.— Cloth or Felt rdter 



Fig. 3.— Drip Bag 



at sufih a high temperature that it has a disagreeable scorched 
taste. It should be remembered that attempts to sterilize at 
a temperature above 195° F. are dangerous, so far as the flavor 
of the finished product is concerned. 

Another serious mistake is sometimes made by putting the 
juice into bottles so large that much of it becomes spoiled 
before it is used after the bottles are opened. Unfermented 
grape-juice properly made and bottled will keep indefinitely, 
if it is not exposed to the atmosphere or mould germs; but 
when a bottle is once opened it should, like canned goods, be 
used as soon as possible, to keep it from spoiling. ., . 



386 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

FLAVOR AND QUALITY IN GRAPE-JUICE 

In the making of unfermented grape- juice a great deal of 
judgment can be displayed and many variations produced so 
as to suit almost any taste by the careful selection of the varie- 
ties of grapes. From the Mission grape, for instance, when 
fully ripe, a juice would be obtained that would be delicate 
and simply sweet, without any other taste ; from the Muscat we 
would get that rich musky flavor found in our leading raisins ; 
in the Concord that sprightly foxy taste so well known; in 
the Catawba or Isabella that fragrance so peculiarly their own, 
and in the lona a pleasing, mild, yet pronounced aroma and 
taste. Thus we might continue along the list. 

Equally as pronounced variations in color can be had, as, 
for instance, almost colorless, yellow, orange, light red, red, 
and a deep purple. 

The richer, sweeter, and better in quality the fruit we use, 
the richer, sweeter, and better will be our unfermented juice. 
If, on the other hand, the fruit is sour, green, and insipid, the 
juice will be likewise. 

USES OF GRAPE-JUICE 

The uses are indeed many. It is used in sickness, con- 
valescence, and good health; as a preventive, restorative, and 
cure; by the young, by persons in the prime of life, and by 
those in old age. It is used in churches for sacramental pur- 
poses; at soda fountains as a cool and refreshing drink; in 
homes, at hotels, and at restaurants as a food, as a beverage, 
as a dessert, and in many other ways. When people become 
accustomed to it they rarely give it up. When properly pre- 
pared, unfermented grape- juice can be made to please the eye 
by its color and attractive appearance, the sense of smell by 
its aroma or fragrance, the palate by its pleasant flavor. 

It is food and drink, refreshment and nourishment, all in 
one. Not a by-product, but made from fruit going to waste — 
one of the blessings given us, that some are too careless, others 
too ignorant, to make use of. 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 887 

FOOD VALUE OF GRAPE-JUICE 

The effects of unfermented grape-juice on the human sys- 
tem have been studied for a number of years, especially at the 
so-called grape cures so long in vogue in Europe. A smaller 
number of investigations have been made in laboratories. 

It is quite generally claimed that using a reasonably large 
amount of unfermented grape-juice with an otherwise suitable 
mixed diet is beneficial and that digestion is improved, intes- 
tinal fermentation diminished, and that gains in body weight 
result. It should not be forgotten that the abundant diet and 
hygienic methods of living practiced at the grape cores play 
an important part, but even taking all this into account it 
seems fair to conclude that some of the good results can be 
directly attributed to the unfermented grape-juice. 

Grape-juice contains the same kinds of nutrients as other 
foods. The percentage of water is high, and thus it resembles 
liquid foods more closely than solid foods* It is sometimes 
compared with milk, the most conunon liquid food. It con- 
tains less water than milk, more carbohydrates, and less pro- 
tein, fat, and ash. Carbohydrates, largely present in the form 
of sugar^ are the principal nutritive ingredients. It is evident, 
therefore, that grape-juice is essentially an energy-yielding 
food, and may help the body to become fatter, though it can 
not materially assist in building nitrogenous tissue. Sugars in 
moderate amounts are wholesome foods, and grape-juice offers 
such material in a reasonably dilute as well as palatable form. 
Undoubtedly the agreeable flavor increases the appetite, a by 
no means unimportant consideration. 

Besides the receipts given below many more are enumerated, 
such as grape lemonade, grape-juice plain, grape soda 
water, etc. 

GRAPE-JUICE AND EGG 

Put in the bottom of a wineglass two tablespoons of grape- 
juice. Add to this the beaten white of one egg and a little 
chopped ice; sprinkle sugar over the top and serw. This is 
often served in sanitariums. 



888 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

GRAPE NECTAR 

Take the juice of two lemons and one orange, one pint of 
grape- juice, one small cup of sugar, and a pint of water. 
Serve ice cold. If served from a punch bowl, sliced lemon and 
orange add to the appearance. 

GRAPE PUNCH 

Boil together one pound of sugar and half a pint of water 
until it spins a thread. Take from the fire and when j:ool add 
the juice of six lemons and a quart of grape- juice. Stand 
aside overnight. Serve with plain water, apoUinaris, or soda 
water. 

GRAPE WINE 

Stem the grapes, mash thoroughly, and set away for 
twenty-four hours. Then squeeze through a bag. To each 
quart of juice add one quart of water. To every quart of 
the mixture put three pounds of sugar. Set all away in stone 
jars and skim daily till it stops bubbling. Then bottle. 

MY LADY'S WINE 

Take fine grapes of any good variety — the C(Hnmon Con- 
cord, the musky Delaware, the Muscatel, or Diana. Lay them 
in a dampened, strong straining cloth, then fold up the cloth 
in bag shape, lay the bag in an earthen bowl or jar, and 
break the grapes by mashing with a wooden pestle or masher. 
Hang up the bag to drain, and squeeze out all the juice. The 
colored part next the skin carries a pretty color and also has 
much of the fine aroma of the grape. In the matter of sweeten- 
ing be careful not to take too much sugar, but keep the juice so 
it will retain quite a degree of acidity. Instead of putting 
the sugar directly in the grape-juice, melt it in fresh cold 
water before adding, and let the proportion be one glass of 
sweetened water to two parts grape- juice. Stir all t<^ther 
and set on ice. Serve in a pitcher with pieces of ice in the 
pitcher, and pour into small glasses, for instance, lemonade 
glasses. 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD 889 

CIDER CUP 

Have in a pitcher cracked ice. Over the ice pour a quart 
of sweet cider and a bottle of club soda. Drop in a few pieces 
of mint, and if you have them a few thin slices of such fruit 
as bananas, apples, pears, etc. Serve at once. 

DANDELION WINE 

Put four quarts of dandelion flowers in a jar, pour over 
them a gallon of boiling water, cover, and let stand for three 
days. Then put over the fire, add the juice and grated yel- 
low of the peel of three oranges and one lemon. Simmer all 
together fifteen minutes. Strain through a thin bag and 
pour over three pounds of sugar in an earthen crock. When 
lukewarm, add three tablespoons of yeast, cover and set 
away in an airy, clean place for from seven to ten days. Then 
skim, strain, and bottle. 

EGGNOG 

Beat the yolk of one egg very light. Add one wineglass 
of whiskey, drop by drop, until the egg is cooked. Next put 
in one tablespoon of rum, one glass of rich milk or cream, 
and lastly the white of the egg beaten to a stiff froth. Nut- 
meg to taste. 

A CHILD'S EGGNOG 

Beat an egg till foamy, add two tablespoons of milk, one 
tablespoon of sugar, a pinch of salt, and a dust of nutmeg, 
and serve in a small wineglass. 

EGG WINE 

In a tumbler break a perfectly fresh egg. Beat till smooth 
and thick. Add a tablespoon of pulverized sugar and then a 
wineglass of port wine. 

If wine is not allowed, fill up the glass with fresh milk 
and put a dash of nutmeg on top. 



890 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

GINGER PUNCH 

Chop one pound of Canton ginger, then add two cups of 
sugar and one pint of water. Boil together fifteen minutes. 
When cool add a cup of orange- juice and strain. This will 
flavor eight or ten cups of water. 

MILK PUNCH 

To a pint of new milk add two tablespoons of sugar. Stir 
and dissolve the sugar in a little of the milk as you add. 
Lastly, stir in two tablespoons of wine. 

MINT JULEP 

The original concoction from which this drink derives its 
name was first invented in the South. It was made of rum 
and brandy undiluted, excepting for a little fine ice. The 
receipt given here can be partaken of without serious results. 
Place one tablespoon each of red raspberry, lemon, orange 
juices and dry sherry in glasses filled with shaved ice. Ar- 
range sprigs of mint in each one and serve with straws. The 
amount given is for small glasses and should be increased 
according to the size of glasses used. If the ice does not dilute 
this mixture quite sufficiently, water can be added. [See il- 
lustration, Plate XXIX.] 

PASSOVER WINE 

Remove from their stems a pound and a half of fine raisins. 
Bruise them with a masher, then chop them coarse, put in an 
earthen crock, add a small sliced lemon, and pour over three 
quarts of fresh water just boiling. Cover the crock in a cool 
place. Next day take a silver spoon and stir all together 
thoroughly. Cover. Repeat the stirring next morning and for 
two following mornings. Then strain through a thick bag and 
bottle or use. 

ROOT BEER 

Root beer is a wholesome drink, as our American fore- 
fathers realized when in the springtime they took their chil- 



BEVERAGES: HOT AND COLD S91 

dren into the woods and taught them how to choose roots and 
herbs for it. In those days that was one of the "object-les- 
sons" in Nature. What did they choose in those fields and 
skirting forests? Dandelion and burdock and yellow dock 
roots, the bark of the wild cherry also, and birch bark. They 
had hanging in the garret a bag of hops of the last year's 
picking from the wild vine that ran over tree and fence. 
Then out in the fields again they found sarsaparilla and 
elecampane and spikenard. 

In making the beer wash the roots very clean. Then 
bruise them so that their peculiar virtue or quality will 
readily yield itself. Take an ounce of each ingredient to two 
gallons of water. Be sure the big kettle you boil in is per- 
fectly scoured and clean. Put in the cold water and your roots, 
etc., set over the fire and bring slowly to boil. Simmer for 
about half an hour, adding toward the end and to the pro- 
portion cited above a pound of sugar and twenty to twenty- 
five drops of the oil of sassafras or spruce. Put slowly into 
an earthen crock and cool to lukewarm. Then add the yeast, 
which to the above proportion is eight tablespoons of liquid 
yeast, or a dry yeast cake dissolved in a cup of tepid water. 
Stir in the yeast, cover and set away to ferment. In from 
three to six hours it will be drinkable. It may be kept in 
the jar for immediate drinking, or it may be bottled and the 
working delayed. 

ROYAL SHRUB 

For one glass use three tablespoons of strained red currant- 
juice, two tablespoons of pineapple- juice, produced by cooking 
the fruit in sugar and water. Fill with seltzer water. Add 
one tablespoon of sugar and put a tablespoon of whipped 
cream on top. The fruit juices and seltzer must be ice cold, 
otherwise a tablespoon of shaved ice must be placed in each 
glass. [See illustration, Plate XXX.] 

STRAWBERRY PUNCH 

Make tea by pouring a quart of fresh boiling water on 
three teaspoons of tea. In a punch bowl lay a four-inch square 



392 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

of ice, add the juice of four lemons and one orange, two cups 
of sugar, and a box of small strawberries — the field straw- 
berries are nicest, but if they are not to be had, use the large 
cultivated berries and cut them in quarters or eighths. Now 
pour in your tea, and add two pint bottles of apollinaris, or 
the same amount of clear spring water. Stir about and ladle 
into cups when served. 

SUMMER ZEPHYR 

Cut a pound and a half of rhubarb into thin slices, cover 
with water, and add one bay leaf and one stick of paper-bark 
cinnamon. Simmer until the rhubarb is tender, then strain. 
Add to the juice one cup of sugar and simmer ten minutes. 
Then add one pint of orange-juice, the juice of three lemons, 
half a cup of preserved ginger- juice. Put shaved ice in a 
pitcher and add the cooled concoction. In each glass place a 
halved strawberry or cherries, or any seasonable fruit. [See 
illustration, Plate XXX.] 

WASSAIL BOWL 

Mix half a pound of brown sugar, one pint of ale, half a 
nutmeg grated, half a teaspoon of ginger, a pinch of cin- 
namon. Heat, but do not boil. Then add half a pint of 
Malaga wine, one quart more of ale, and the grated rind of 
one lemon. Turn into a punchbowl and add as many cored 
and baked apples as there are guests. Serve while hot [See 
illustration, Plate XXXI.] 

WHIPS 

Sweeten to your taste a pint of thin cream and beat in a 
wineglass of wine and a tablespoon of the extract of lemon. 
Set in a cool place. Beat to a stiff froth the whites of three 
eggs. Stir them rapidly into the cream. Pour in wineglasses 
and serve. [See illustration, Plate XXXI.]

Strain, add salt to taste, and serve hot. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL 

Heat the blackberries and press through a sieve. Strain 
the juice through a piece of cheesecloth. Take three pints of 
blackberry juice (it should not be too sweet) and add one 
pound of loaf sugar. Tie up a small bag of whole cinnamon, 
allspice, and a smaller quantity of cloves. Boil together the 
spices and juice twenty minutes slowly. Take off the stove, 
and flavor with California brandy enough to give a strong 
flavor. Bottle and cork tight. 

FLAXSEED TEA OR LEMONADE 

Blanch two tablespoons of flaxseed and then boil two 
hours in a quart of water. Keep close covered while boiling. 
Strain, and add lemon- juice and sugar to taste. 

HOARHOUND COUGH SYRUP 

Make one pint of strong hoarhound tea and strain. Dis- 
solve one ounce of gum arabic in hot water, add to the tea. 
Add also one pound of white sugar. Boil to a syrup, skim 
when you take it from the fire, and add one teaspoon of the 
tincture of lobelia. 

JELLY WATER 

Stir a tablespoon of currant jelly in a tumbler of fresh, 
cold water. Drop in a small bit of ice and serve. Other jel- 
lies may be used — ^as^ tart apple jelly, grape jelly, barberry 
jelly.

SLIPPERY ELM BARK TEA 

Break the bark in small pieces, rinse quickly, and then 
cover with, fresh, boiling water. Set the bowl in a warm 
place, put a cover upon it, and let the bark steep or infuse 
for half an hour. Then set where it will cool. Sweeten to 
taste, and drop bits of cracked ice in the cup from which it is 
drunk.

MIXING INGREDIENTS ONE AT A TIME 

IF you have ever seen a druggist compoimd a prescription you 
noticed that be did not put in two or three things to mix at 
one time with what he had in his mortar, but blended each 
ingredient with what he was making before he added another. 
The same rule has fine results in cooking. If you have three 
or four or five ingredients, do not mix them all at once, but 
stir two together, then add the third, then the fourth, then the 
fifth, stirring each time. 

THE BENEFICENT PAN OF HOT WATER 

A pan of hot water set in the upper oven evens the baking. 
If the oven becomes overheated, the pan filled with cold water 
reduces the temperature in the best possible way. In cooking 
canned vegetables, such as com, if the saucepan holding the 
com is set in a pan of hot water, the moderated heat develops 
the taste of the corn and also saves constant watching that the 
corn does not bum. Cereals are best :cooked in this way, al- 
though we call the equipment a double-boiler when we use the 
pan of hot water and saucepan for such grains. Finally, a 



398 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

pan of hot water is ever ready for making sauces and gravies, 
and saves the burning both of food and saucepans. 

APPEARANCE OF MEATS 

Grood beef is of a bright red color and moderately fat. 

Good mutton is deep red and close-grained. 

Good pork is close-grained, and the rind is smooth and thin. 

TO MAKE TOUGH MEAT TENDER 

A tablespoon of vinegar added to the water in which meats 
or fowls are boiling helps to make the flesh tender. 

WHEN SALT SHOULD BE ADDED IN COOKING 

MEAT 

To put salt on meat when it is raw makes it hard. Do not 
salt your meat till it is almost cooked, at the point where it is 
beginning to get tender. 

ADVANTAGE OF A VARIETY OF SEASONINGS 

A French chef is authority for the statement that the most 
economical cook is a woman who keeps her pantry lavishly 
supplied with all sorts of seasonings, both the cheap and the 
expensive. His argument is that a tough piece of meat, care- 
fully cooked and most alluringly seasoned, may result in a dish 
of even finer flavor than filet of beef at one dollar a pound. 
Among the seasonings which it is good to have constantly 
in stock are bay leaves, whole mace, peppercorns, cloves, all- 
spice, berries, sage, summer savory, thyme, sweet marjoram, 
cayenne, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, kitchen bouquet, 
curry, mushroom, tomato and walnut catsup, celery salt, and, 
I might add, a box of green parsley growing in a sunny win- 
dow of the kitchen. 

This list may sound formidable and expensive to the house- 
wife who places her whole dependence on pepper and salt. 
Experience will teach her, however, that it is cheap. If the 
seasonings are put in tightly closed cans, or bottled, they 



ITEMS OF VALUE 899 

will keep perfectly for almost any length of time. Buy herbs 
— such as sage, bay leaves, etc. — in the smallest quantities, and 
be sure they are fresh. The advantage of having a goodly 
array of seasonings at hand is that you can find a different 
flavor for meat dishes every day. A variety may be given to 
meats which would almost fail to be palatable if they were 
not excellently seasoned. 

HOW TO DRY HERBS 

In drying herbs from your garden, do not cut and dry them 
in the sun. Neither tie them in bunches and hang the bunches 
up under cover. In the first instance, you dry out the herb's 
pectdiar oil or virtue. By the second method, the leaves dis- 
color by their own dampness, mould, or fermentation. 

The right way in drying herbs for your kitchen and possible 
medicinal use is to gather them as soon as they bej^n to open 
their flo w£rs« anf TolayTKefn on some netting in a dry shed or 
room where the^air will get at them on all sides. Be sure they 
arc dry and not moist when you cut or pick them, and free 
Them from dirt and decayed leaves. After they are entirely 



dried out, put them in paper bags upon which you have written 
the name of the herb and the date of tieing it up. Hang them 
where the air is dry and there is no chance of their moulding. 

POWDERS OF SAVORY HERBS 

Strip the leaves from the stalks, pound, sift out the 
coarse pieces, put the powder in bottles, and cork tight. Label 
with exactness every bottle. If, for the convenience of instant 
use in gravies, soups, etc., you wish different herbs mixed, 
pound the leaves together when you make them into powders. 
Celery seed, dried lemon-peel, and other spicy things can thus 
be combined and ready for the moment's call. 

ABOUT PEPPER 

Of peppers, the white and cayenne are thought the most 
harmless. In cooking for the sick, or for perscois of weak 
digestion, it is well to leave out the pepper altogether. If, 



400 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

however, you think you must use some kind, take the more 
harmless white, or cayenne. Black pepper is the dried fruit of 
an East Indian shrub. White pepper comes from the same 
plant and is made from the black pepper by taking off the 
outer scale. It is not so strong as. the black, but has a finer 
flavor. Cayenne is a preparation from the dried fruit of cap- 
sicum, and when pure and taken in slight quantities, a stimulant 
to digestion. Paprika is a Hungarian red pepper, and is not 
so strong as the cayenne. 

AS TO SAUCES 

Every cook should know how to make three or four simple 
sauces, for nothing adds more to the appetizing qualities of a 
meat. The French cynic who said that the reason why the 
English considered it bad form to dip their bread in their 
sauces was because they had no sauces worth dipping bread 
into, had a slight foundation for his remark. 

A thick mayonnaise is the basis for sauce tartare. Add 
to it a tablespoon of chopped cucumber pickle, chopped olives, 
a few capers, and a dash of onion- juice, season rather highly, 
and toss lightly. 

A sauce little used in this country is horseradish mixed with 
cream, which is a favorite in Russia, with plain boiled meat. 

RATIO OF RAW TO COOKED CHICKEN 

Thirteen pounds of raw chicken make three quarts of cooked 
chicken — enough to serve thirty people. One quart of chicken 
salad serves eight people liberally. 

MILK FOR CUSTARD 

The success of a custard is much increased if the milk is 
scalded and cooled before being made into the custard. 

KEEPING MILK AND BUTTER 

The air where milk and butter stand should be the purest. 
Both milk and butter absorb smells, and they will be con- 



ITEMS OF VALUE 401 

taminated and unwholesome, and also taste of any bad air to 
which they are subject. Milk readily absorbs and develops 
bacteria of the air. No article of food requires more care 
and concern in its wholesome keeping. 

In traveling in New Mexico I once saw a milk room open- 
ing into the cows' stables ! There, surrounded by the noxious 
air, the milk stood while the cream rose. The cream and milk 
tasted of the stable disgustingly and were unusable except to 
the strong stomachs of the people who lived under such 
conditions. 

BUTTER PADDLES 

The little paddles of hollywood used for making butter 





wm 



Holly Butter Paddles 

into balls for table use should be scrubbed, rinsed, sunned, and 
laid in the ice-box till their next use. 

TO HELP IN. WHIPPING CREAM 

If the cream seems thin, add a pinch of finely powdered 
gum-arabsc mixed with double its quantity of powdered sugar. 

COLD EGGS FOR BEATING 
The colder eggs are the sooner you can beat them to a froth. 

TO CHOOSE MACARONI 

The best macaroni is yellowish in color, should not break 
easHy while cooking, and in cooking swells to three or four 
times it size when dry. 

RADISHES WITH RICE 

It 16 a gastronomic fact that with rice something should 
be eaten that offers a little resistance to digestion. People 



402 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

who eat rice daily are aware of this. The Chinese, for in- 
stance, takes radishes with his rice. 

WHEN PIES OVERFLOW 

Fruit pies made from juicy fruits sometimes lose half their 
finest part by the juice overflowing, or pushing through the 
crust where upper and under crusts meet. The escaping juice, 
moreover, soaks the crust. Our grandmothers overcame the 
difficulty by tieing round the pie when ready to bake a strip of 
stiff damp linen. 

TO PREVENT SOGGY CRUST 

In making the filling for a cocoanut or custard pie, there 
will be less chance of having a soggy crust if the milk is brought 
to the scalding point and the eggs, sugar, and seasonings stirred 
in before putting in the crust. This will shorten the time of 
cooking by half. 

DO NOT USE MELTED BUTTER IN CAKE 
In cakemaking, do not melt butter ; it spoils the cake. 

TO PREVENT HASTY BROWNING 

Keep in a pantry drawer sheets of clean brown paper to 
slip over a dish that is browning too rapidly. A sheet of 
asbestos paper, or of oiled or greased paper, may be used in 
the same way and will serve the purpose quickly. 

FRYING DOUGHNUTS 

In the first place, have the lard hot and quiet, not boiling 
and bubbling. Drop in the doughnuts. They will disappear a 
second and then rise to the top. Have a long fork and turn 
them, not piercing, while they cook. Do not let them soak 
fat, as they do while lying cooking only on one side, or in a 
fat not hot enough. When they are browned all round, pick 
them up with the fork, which does not take so much of the 
fat as a skimmer, and lay in a colander standing near in a 



ITEMS OF VALUE 408 

warm place and lined with brown paper. The warmth from 
the colander keeps the fat on the cakes melted and allows 
the brown paper to absorb it. 

TO BROWN BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITHOUT 

MOLASSES 

Using molasses to make buckwheat cakes brown you in- 
troduce a sweetening into the cakes. This many people dislike. 
It is well to know you can get the brown color by putting a 
handful of Indian meal in the batter. The meal will also help 
make the cakes light, while the tendency of molasses is to make 
them heavy. 

USES OF A PINCH OF SALT 

It is said that a pinch of salt added to a pot of coffee or of 
tea just before pouring will increase the natural aroma of the 
dish. 

A pinch of salt added to a dish too sweet wiH help conceal 
the sweetness. 

BREAD AND CRACKER CRUMBS 

It is sound economy to have a glass jar with a tight cover 
for rolled and crisp cracker or bread crumbs. Into it you 
can drop the powdered crumbs which you make from crusts 
and scraps of bread and crackers, and have always on hand 
the crumbs so necessary in frying, in cooking meats, vegetables, 
cheese, pudding, and other dishes. 

TO SAVE AFTER SCORCHING 

. If milk scorches — it is best to heat it in a double-boiler, 
but sometimes for haste it is set immediately over the 
fire — lift the saucepan off the fire and set it in a pan of 
cold water till the bottom of the saucepan is cool. Then pour 
off the milk, keeping back the scorched part clinging to tlie 
bottom of the saucepan. 

This same method will be found effective in the scorching 
of vegetables, meats, and all articles of food. 



404 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

TO DESTROY SMELL OF COOKING CABBAGE, ETC. 

In cooking cabbage or anything having strong odors, set on 
the back of the stove a granite cup one quarter full of vinegar. 
Keep this hot. Do not let it boil, or burn, and it will absorb 
all the odor. 

A piece of coal put in the pot when cabbage or cauliflower 
is boiling destroys all unpleasant smell through the house. 

Burned sugar is a deodorizer. Sprinkle the sugar on a few 
live coals on a shovel and leave in the room for five minutes. 

PORCELAIN FOR ACIDS 

In cooking fruit, or in using any acid preparation in cook- 
ing, be sure your saucepans and kettles are porcelain or en- 
ameled or earthenware. If you use metal ware you run the risk 
of having the acid of the fruits combine with the metals and 
form deadly poisons. All fruits and vegetables holding any 
acid whatever should be cooked in porcelain, earthenware, or 
best enameled saucepans and kettles. Never cook anything 

ACID IN TIN OR COPPER. 

TO CLEAN DECANTERS AND CRUETS 

Such glassware as decanters, carafes, and vinegar cruets 
scmietimes become so discolored that shot or fine charcoal will 
not wash them clean. Try this remedy, which ha& worked 
satisfactorily: Fill the bottle with finely chopped potato skins. 
Cork tight, and let the bottle stand for three days. Empty 
and rinse thoroughly. 

ABOUT PLANKING BOARDS 

A board for planking fish should be made of hard, well- 
planed wood, either hickory or oak. If it is to be used in a gas 
stove, measure the broiling chamber before ordering the plank. 
Have it one inch smaller than the oven, to allow of its being 
easily slipped in and out. Have the board about four inches 
narrower than its length, and slightly rounded, ironing board 



ITEMS OF VALUE 405 

fashion, at one end, to accommodate the tail of the fish. The 
older and blacker the board becomes the finer flavor it imparts 
to a fish. Never wash it with soap; scrub with a brush and 
boiling water immediately on removing the plank from the 
table. Occasionally give it a good rub with sandpaper. 

TO KEEP PEARS FOR WINTER USE 

Lay the pears on a shelf in a dry, cool place. Set them 
stems up and so far apart that they do not touch one another. 
Allow the air to move freely in the room in which they lie. 
Layers of paper or of straw make a soft bed, but the less the 
pear touches the shelf or resting-place the better for its 
keeping. 

TO PACK EGGS 

Put into a butter firkin a thick layer of coarse dry salt, then 
a layer of eggs, with the small end down, another layer of salt, 
then eggs, and so on until the firkin is full. Cover and keep 
in a dry place. These eggs will keep put up in this way almost 
any length of time. 

TO MAKE BREAD CLOTHS 

Cloths for breadmaking, to put over sponge at night to 
preserve its even temperature, and to lay over rising bread to 
save it from chill, are nicely made by taking a good quality of 
cheesecloth, folding double, thus making a square of about 
three-quarters of a yard or a yard, and laying a thin layer of 
cotton batting in between. Quilt the batting in coarse quilt- 
ings so that it will not lose its place in the frequent washings 
the cloths must have. 

PAPER ON PANTRY SHELVES 

There used to be an old custom — ^which was thought a gijod V 

one by some housekeepers — of covering pantry shelves with 
paper. Indeed, there were fancy-colored papers with lace bor- 
ders made for such use. But the sanitary housekeeper and 



406 THE HOME COOK BOOK 

cook of the present day who places cleanliness and simplicity 
before all else, has seen that these paper-covered shelves har- 
bored dirt and gave hiding-places for dust. She has, therefore, 
abolished the paper. Pantry shelves should be painted a fair 
white, and if there are several coats of paint, so much the 
easier to wash them off clean. The utensils and dishes upon a 
well-painted shelf can be moved about easily, and the shelf 
often wiped with a cloth wrung out of hot water — ^this quite 
aside from the scrubbing of regular scrubbing days. 

THE USE OF WINE 

This book docs not advise or encourage the use of wine 
in simple, every-day cooking. Now and then some of our 
receipts include it as a flavoring. But it may always be 
omitted. We certainly advise against its common use. Its 
constant presence may stimulate a depraved or morbid appetite 
for drink.
