THE QUEEN COOK BOOK. 



Wheat Bread and Biscuit. 

I pint and three table- 2 quarts flour 
spoons milk 2 even teaspoons salt 

^ tea cup yeast 
Take out one pint of flour for kneading next morn- 
ing, make a hollow in center of flour, put all the 
ingredients in, stir together, then stir in the flour to a 
thick batter (not dough). Use a tin pan with a good 
fitting cover, then wrap in double flannel and set it 
on two warm bricks in a warm room over night. (It 
is a good plan to keep two bricks in the oven.) Take 
it out early next morning, soon as you can get it 
warmed through. Work in the largest half of your 
reserved flour and knead ten minutes, by doubling the 
hand and pressing the knuckles in the dough, lifting 
one fist up, as you put the other down, with some 
force. Then flour the board and knead on that for 
ten minutes more with the palm of the hand, using 
the rest of the flour or more, having the dough as soft 
as possible to manage well. At first the soft dough 
will seem to stick and trouble the inexperienced cook, 
but she will soon learn to manage it, to her great 
relief. The dough must not get cold. Butter your 
pan before making out the bread. §et it in heater 
and keep warm. If good it will be light in one hour. 
Raise up the edge of loaf; if it looks light and foamy 



lO The Queen Cook Book 

(not stringy) it is light for baking. Bake tnrfe-fourths 
of an hour, if oven is hot enough. If you can hold 
hand in oven till you can count twenty only, it is right 
heat, or if a teaspoon of flour on a tki browns in five 
minutes. Bread should be in the oven fifteen min- 
utes before it begins to brown. When baked through 
take it out of pan and stand it on end; lean it against 
something, so as to let the air circulate around it, to 
give a dry crust. When perfectly cold, put it in a 
sweet clean jar, cover with paper and plate. Do not 
wrap a cloth around it, as our mothers used to, as the 
cloth absorbs the moisture of the bread. If you wet 
the bread with water you can put one rounded tea- 
spoon of butter in water. Milk or water should 
always be warm. This receipt is for bottled yeast and 
makes one large loaf. If you use dried yeast, take 
one-fourth of a cake for a loaf and a half cup more 
wetting, and you can knead it and raise it twice after 
the sponge. To make good bread it is best to know 
how to select good flour. When pressed tightly, it 
adheres to the hand, remains in shape and shows the 
imprint of the lines on the hand. It has a yellowish 
white tinge and when made into a paste with water, 
and well worked, is tough and elastic. Use one kind 
of flour for bread, pastry and cake. After selecting 
the flour, the next important thing is to have good 
strong, sweet yeast. The compressed yeast cakes are 
very good and convenient. In large cities you can 
obtain the soft yeast cakes done up in tin foil. They 
are very nice, but must be fresh. I much prefer the 
flavor of bread made from bottled yeast. I have been 
thus minute in describing the process of bread making 
for the sake of the inexperienced, while it may seem 
unneccessary to the practical housekeeper. Always use

a tin pan to raise the dough in. Wooden bowls are 
not good. 

Bottled Yeast. 

6 medium-sized potatoes }4 cup sugar 
2 y^ quarts water J^ cup salt 

I handful good hops J4 pint yeast or J^ of a cake 

Boil the six potatoes in the two and a half quarts of 
water; when just done skim them into a gallon crock, 
mash line, and stir light with a fork. Put hops in a 
thin bag and boil live minutes in the potato water, 
then squeeze dry and pour the hop water on to the pota- 
toes, sugar and salt. When cool enough to hold the 
finger in it, put in the yeast. - Make it about 3 o'clock 
in the afternoon. Stir it well f very hour till bedtime. 
Keep it warm and covered all night. Bottle it the 
first thing in the morning in pint bottles. If good it 
will sparkle and foam when stirred. Put your corks 
in loosely until they stop popping out, say three hours. 
Then tie them down as beer bottles are tied. One- 
half cup of this yeast makes a large loaf) ten inches 
long, six inches wide, and three or four inches high — a 
good size for sandwiches cut in three pieces. For a 
large family make twice the quantity, which would be 
one gallon. It will keep six weeks in cool weather, 
and four in hot weather. Keep it in cellar. This yeast 
simply foams, never rises any higher. 

Salt-Rising Bread. 

Stir into one pint of warm milk one teaspoon of 
salt, flour enough to make quite a thick batter, beat- 
ing it well. Set the dish in hot water till light, then 
put it in the center of flour in bread pan, and add warm 
milk and salt according to desired quantity. Make it 
up (without sponging) and put into pans the same as 



12 The Queen Cook Book 

other bread. The yeast will rise in about six hours. 
You can take a part of the yeast and make a small tin 
of biscuit for tea. 

Bread for the Sea. 

Bread on sea, on account of constant moisture, 
seldom has crispness as on shore. If you are yacht- 
ing, it is wise to have tight tin boxes to keep your 
bread in, wrapped in thick white paper. Bob, the sea 
cook, says: " I buy my yeast of the brewer, and take 
a board two feet square and cover it with white blot- 
ting paper. I pour my yeast on the paper and stand 
it in the sun. When it is dry I break up the yeast cake 
in small pieces and put it in a ground-glass-stoppered 
bottle. Thi^ yeast will be good for two months. One 
heaping tablespoon of this dried yeast is sufficient for 
three pints of wetting, which will make three large 
loaves. For making the bread, sponge and raise it the 
same as other bread. " When the bread is being made, 
he says: " Now comes real work, and go for it. Mash 
her and knead her all you can.*' I think this is good 
for all bread. Let rise, and bake as other bread. 
When bread or cake cleaves from the pan it is done, 
and it also has a hollow sound when you knock on the 
bottom of loaf. Do not open the oven door when 
the bread or cake is just boiling hot, for it is almost in a 
liquid state and the least cold air will make it fall in 
the center. 

Rye and Indian Bread. 

3 cups sour milk J^ cup molasses 

2 cups rye meal i J4 teaspoon soda 

I J^ cups corn m 2 teaspoons salt 

Put one teas; ^on s< la in milk and the half spoon 

in the molasse I^ ou use sweet milk use three 



The Queen Cook Book 13 

teaspodns of baking powder. Beat well together as 
soft as loaf cake. Steam three hours, or bake one 
hour and a half. I prefer sweet milk and three 
teaspoons of baking powder. 

Rye Bread, Baked. 

Make ^a sponge of half wheat and half rye, the same 
as for other bread. Double the quantity of salt. In 
the morning add sufficient rye flour to make a soft 
dough. Knead lightly; when light bake in a moder- 
ate oven one hour or more. 

Graham Bread, Baked. 

Make a sponge the same as rye only using the gra- 
ham flour, adding one-half cup molasses and two tea- 
spoons salt. One-half teaspoon soda in molasses. 

Boston Brown Bread. 

2 large cups corn meal J^ cup molasses 
I large cup rye meal i teaspoon soda 

% cup yeast 2 teaspoons salt * 

Make a pint of sponge early in the morning, with 
your yeast, of wheat flour. Scald your meal stiff with 
boiling water, when cool and sponge is light, stir all 
the ingredients well together as stiff as cake only. 
It should be ready to bake in an hour, or steam, just 
which you prefer. Steam three hours or bake in slow 
oven one hour and a half. 

Boston Brown Bread. 

I pint corn meal J^ cup molasses 

I pint graham flour J^ teaspoon soda 

J4 cup yeast 2 teaspoons salt 

Scald the meal with boiling milk. When cool 
enough add all the ingredients and the cool milk 



t4 The Queen Coak Book 

enough to make a sponge batter, stir in thd rest of 
the flour next morning, beat well, let rise. Can steam 
it three hours and bake one-half hour, or bake it one 
hour and a half. 

Graham Bread, Without Yeast, Baked* 

3>^ cups graham flour i heaping teaspoon salt 
^ cup of. molasses . 2 teaspoons soda 

Equal parts of sour and sweet milk to make a bat- 
ter as thick as pound cake. Put half of soda in the 
milk and half in molasses, beat to a foam and add 
to the batter. Bake one and a half hours in a moder- 
ate oven. This has the merit of being naore quickly 
made than others when you discover there is not bread 
enough for the next meal. It is nicest when just cold. 
You can add one-half pint of hot oat meal gruel to any 
of these brown breads if you choose. 

Boston Brown Bread, Steamed. 

2 cups graham flour i cup milk 

I cup white flour ! cup molasses 

I teaspoon soda 2 teaspoons (even) salt 

Steam three hours and bake twenty minutes. 

Old School Yeast. 

Boil two liberal handfuls of good hops in three 
quarts of water in a thin bag, squeeze dry. When 
cool stir in one quart of flour, one small cup of sugar, 
and one small cup of salt. Cover this in a stone jar 
and stand three days in a warm place stirring it occa- 
sionally. On the fourth day add one quart of nicely 
mashed potatoes. Let it stand until the day following, 
when it will be ready for use. A small half tea cup is 
enough for two good sized loaves of bread. If kept 
in a cool place, will keep six weeks in summer, and 



The Queen Cook Book 1 5 

three months in winter. This yeast does not foam. 
You may think it worthless; try it and you will not 
doubt. Messenger, 

Potato Yeast. 

Take ten potatoes from the dinner pot; wet a pint 
of flour with a pint of the potato water. Two table- 
spoons each of white sugar and salt. A yeast cake 
dissolved. Let it rise till next morning then cover 
tight or bottle. This will keep two weeks. Three- 
fourths of a cup will raise two loaves. Sponge and 
raise again. 

Parker House Rolls. 

1 pint boiled milk i large tablespoon butter 

2 quarts flour i teaspoon salt 

% cup yeast i heaping tablespoon sugar 

Beat all well together for ten minutes in soft sponge 
for over night, then knead well in the morning, roll 
out thin and soft, cut with a roll cutter or cut with a 
pint pail cover. Rub it over with a little melted but- 
ter and lap over like a turnover, let rise, bake twenty 
minutes. Heat over carefully for supper or lunch. 
These are splendid and never fail if directions are fol- 
lowed. Keep warm. Knead fifteen minutes. 

You can use this same recipe using the yeast cake, 
making the dough stiff enough to knead fifteen min- 
utes at night instead of sponge, then knead it fifteen 
minutes more in the morning. Let stand till 3 p. m., 
knead fifteen minutes more, make in rolls, when light 
bake for tea. 

French Breakfast Rolls. 

Take of good bread dough that is kneaded ready for 
its last rising what would make a half loaf of bread, 



l6 The Queen Cook Book 

more or less, as you need, in quantity. Cut from this 
pieces of dough about the size of a biscuit (after 
working in two tablespo ons of butter and one of sugar 
if you Hke it). Then n.^1 the pieces of dough under 
the hand till it is round. Flatten it a little and then 
let it stand on the molding board till the last of the 
rolls are finished. Then let them remain five minutes 
covered to prove if light. Have a saucer of melted 
butter in which dip the ball of your hand and press 
the whole weight of the ball of your hand across the 
center of each roll so as to dent it almost through. 
Then fold them over and place in a baking pan so they do 
not touch. Let rise till very light. It will most likely 
take twice as long as bread. They should bake in 
twelve minutes. If you wish these rolls for tea or for 
the next morning breakfast set them in the refrigerator. 
They are very delicious when thus treated. 

Baking-Powder Biscuit. 

I quart flour i >^ cup milk 

3 heaping tablespoom 2heaping teaspoons baking- 

butter powder 

r ttkjLspoon salt 
The first thing is to see if the oven is very hot. 
Have everything ready to work with, then sift the 
baking-powder, salt and flour together twice; then rub 
the butter in well. Mix with the milk as soft and as 
little as you can handle it. Roll from half to three- 
quarters of an inch thick and bake in a quick oven. 
Some set them ten minutes in the cold. Let all the 
ingredients be right cold. Success depends largely on 
speed and the hot oven. All biscuits, rusks or rolls 
when nearly baked can be washed over on top either 
with milk or the sweetened white of egg. 



The Queen Cook Book 1 7 

Cream Biscuit. 

Cream biscuit and cream short cake are made the 
same as baking powder biscuit, using cream (or if 
very rich use half cream and milk) in place of milk and 
butter. 

Rusks. 

I cup sugar 2 cups milk 

1 cup butter J^ cup yeast 

2 eggs I teaspoon salt 

Stir butter and sugar to a cream; add the eggs 
beaten separately, then the milk warm, and yeast, with 
flour enough to make a sponge; let this stand in a 
warm place till light, then knead in flour enough 
to make soft biscuits; cut with cutter and put in 
baking pan, let them stand three hours; bake forty 
minutes in a moderate oven. It is always best to set 
the sponge at night, then it is ready to bake the next 
morning. If they are desired warm for tea, they can 
be set early in the morning. 



G ALETTES. 

I quart flour ^ cup yeast 

5^ pint sweet milk i even teaspoon salt

3 eggs 
Use what flour yo need for the sponge, set to rise, 
keep warm, when light work in the rest of flour, roll 
out, cut round, handling the dough as lightly as 
possible. Set to rise; when light bake fifteen minutes 
in a hot oven. Brush the top with egg. These are 
most delicious. Eat hot, or when cold split and 
toast.

sponge, beat light for six minutes. Let rise over 
night. Then beat eggs well, and add sufiicient flour 
for a soft dough. Roll out about one-half inch thick, 
cut into biscuits, let rise and bake in quick oven. If 
made with care, these are very fine. You can add 
four mashed potatoes^ rubbed through a colander, if 
preferred.

half full of the batter; bake brown, then turn with 
cake turner till brown on the other side;, till well 
cooked in center. When ready to use them, split 
open, toast and butter them nicely, and serve quickly 
while hot. 

Bread Biscuits. 

Take one pound of bread dough, more or less, as 
needed. When it is being molded for the pans, work 
into it two tablespoons of butter, at first chopping it 
in with a knife. Sprinkle flour on the board and 
knead for eight minutes, then form into small biscuits, 
place in your pan, keep warm till light, perhaps two 
hours, and bake. 

Wheat and Indian Bread. 

2 quarts Indian meal 2 teaspoons salt 

1 quart wheat flour i cup good hop yeast 
Scald the meal with boiling water till as thin as 

mush; when cool, so afe not to kill tlie yeast, stir all 
together, knead it as soft as possible, and put it in 
baking pan to rise; when it cracks open and looks 
light, bake two hours in stove oven with paper over it, 
to keep from getting too hard, leaving it in warm oven, 
not hot, all night. It must bake moderately. A 
brick oven is the best for leaving in all night. If 
liked, add two tablespoons of molasses, with a little 
soda in it. 

Corn Bread for Breakfast.

Buckwheat Cakes. 

Get buckwheat free from grit. It is also adulter- 
ated with rye. Into one pint warm water put one tea- 
spoon of salt, two cups of buckwheat flour, and one- 
half cup yeast. Beat well and stand in a warm place 
twenty-four hours. Dissolve one-half teaspoon, or less 
at first, of saleratus, in water enough to make the bat- 
ter as thin as you can turn them, and bake brown and 
dry. Beat thoroughly, bake on a hot griddle. Leave 
a cup, of this batter in jar to start the next with. I 
bake every other morning, stirring up over night. After 



The Queen Cook Book 23 

the first time» they will need a full teaspoon of sale- 
ratus to make sufficiently sweet. Stir up entirely 
new ones with new yeast every three weeks. 

Bread Griddle Cakes. 

One pint bread crumbs soaked in milk over night. 
Rub through a colander, add two well beaten eggs, a 
teaspoon salt, a cup of flour, with just milk enough to 
make a thin batter. Teaspoon baking-powder sifted 
in flour. 

Rice Griddle Cakes. 

These are made the same way as the bread griddle 
cakes, using the rice boiled to a jell and hot, instead 
of bread. Or use rice flour. 

Sweet Corn Griddle Cake^. 

I pint grated com i teaspoon salt

4 eggs 

Flour Griddle Cakes. 

Sift two teaspoons of baking powder into one pint 
of flour. Stir in one cup of sweet cream, and milk 
enough to make a thin batter with two beaten eggs. 
One teaspoon of salt. I think all griddle cakes are 
more tender wet with sour milk or sour cream and 
soda. Half cream and half milk. A great deal 
depends upon the right heat of griddle. 

Cream Short Cake. 

1 quart flour i teaspoon salt 

2 cups sour or sweet cream i even teaspoon soda 

If sweet cream is used^ use two teaspoons of baking 



24 The Queen Cook Book 

powder instead of soda. If one has no cream, can 
use two cups sweet milk and two tablespoons of butter 
cut with a knife into the flour, with salt and baking 
powder. Whenever baking powder is used it should 
be sifted twice through the flour with the salt. Roll 
out long and bake in long tin; cross the top with three 
tined fork. Some prefer to cut them into biscuit, I 
think they are better. 

Orange Short Cake. 

I quart flour i egg 

I cup and three tablespoons i teaspoon salt 

milk 2 heaping teaspoons bak- 

I tablespoon white sugar ing-powder 

3 tablespoons butter 

This quantity makes two short cakes 

Sift baking powder and salt through flour twice; 
then chop the butter in flour, then rub it in. Mix the 
whole together as quickly and with as little hand- 
ling as possible. Roll into three sheets, long as 
your tin, each about half an inch thick. Bake, laying 
one sheet on top of the other, butter the under sheets 
lightly. Slice the oranges while it is baking, pour off 
the juice, sprinkle well with granulated sugar. As 
quick as baked, separate the sheet, spread with butter 
and put a thick layer of oranges between the two 
layers. Set it in oven four minutes. The oranges 
should be cut from around the core in small pieces, 
taking out all the seeds. This is delicious. This is 
the best kind of crust for strawberry shortcake.

wetting gradually to the flour, stirring and kneading all 
the while — add just enough to moisten the flour, the 
dough must be very stiff; knead five minutes; and beat 
with the back of an ax thirty minutes. Then form 
into small round biscuits, stick with a fork three times, 
each one, bake in a moderately quick oven about 
cwenty-five minutes. Brown on top and bottom. 

Egg Biscuit. 

I quart flour 5 tablespoons butter 

5 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons baking-powder 

5 eggs well beaten i teaspoon salt 

Sift the flour, salt, sugar and bakmg-powder together 
twice, then rub the butter m, and add the eggs; knead 
until light and elastic, cover with a damp cloth, let 
stand fifteen minutes. Roll out into a sheet a quarter 
of an inch thick, cut with round cutter. Drop a few 
at a time into boiling water, till edges curl, then into 
cold water for a minute, place in buttered pans, bake 
in moderate oven to a light brown. 

Corn Meal Mush. 

To three pints of boiling water add one pint of corn 
meal, a heaping teaspoon salt; wet the meal with one 
pint of this water before heating; then when the two 
pints boil, stir in the wet meal; keep it where it will just 
boil good and not burn for a full hour or more, stirring 
often; use a hard wood paddle, two feet long, with a 
blade two inches wide and seven inches long to 
stir with. The secret of good n^ush is its thorough cook- 
ing, which gives it the relish. It needs to be stiff 
enough to slice when cold. You can double or 
treble this quantity according to size of family. 



26 The Queen Cook Book 

Fried Mush. 

An acceptable breakfast dish is made by slicing cold 
mush thin and frying in half butter and half lard. 
Can dip in beaten egg and cracker crumbs if you 
like it. 

Oat Meal, Cracked Wheat, Hominy, Rice. 

For one even tea cup full of oat meal washed in 
three waters, pour on one good pint and a half of good 
sweet milk, one teaspoon of salt. Put it in double 
boiler; let it swell for one hour at the boiling 
point, stirring four times; then let it just boil for 
another hour. If you have no milk use water, but it 
is not so good. Cook cracked wheat, hominy and rice 
the same way. Wash each till there are no black 
specks in the water. I have washed one cup of hominy 
in ten waters, before I stopped looking for black specks. 
Keep the water in motion as you pour it of!, so 
the specks will rise. Hominy is the white southern 
corn. If you wish either of these for breakfast put a 
little water on it the night before; it will swell 
over night.

three slices of raw potatoes or a bit of dry bread, which 
furnishes something for the heat to act upon. Test 
the heat also by dropping in a little bit of batter. If 
the heat is right it will quickly rise in a light ball with 
a splutter, and soon brown; serve hot. 

Pork fritters are made by dropping bits of fried 
breakfast bacon in the batter. Fruit fritters by 
dipping quarters or halves in batter, having one piece 
in each fritter. Moisten the flour with milk an hour 
before using, that the flour may swell and thus be 
lighter. Do not put a fork in them; lay them on 
brown paper to drain a minute. 

Sweet Corn Oyster Fritters. 

2 finely floured crackers, i pint grated sweet com 

or more if needed 2 eggs 

Salt and'pepper 

Must hold together well. 

Beat well together; have ready in spider your hot 
lard (half of it beef drippings is better, they will not 
soak fat so much) but not scorching hot, drop in little 
cakes about the size of an oyster, when brown turn 
and fry on the other side, watching constantly for fear 
of burning. If fat is just right heat, the corn fritter 
will be light and delicious; if not, soggy. Beat the 
whites of eggs to a stiff froth just before frying. Serve 
hot to eat with meats; have them cooking while the 
table is being served. 

Japanese Fritters. 

Cut stale bread into slices a half inch thick, then 
cut the slices in pieces about two inches square. Soak 
these squares in fritter batter, about one minute and 
fry in boiling fat, turning them as they brown; when

serve hot. Serve with fairy sauce, or maple syrup. 

French Fritters. 

I tumbler water '^ cup butter

Put all together in stew pan on the stove, and when 
well heated so that the butter is thoroughly melted, 
stir in rapidly one heaping pint of flour. Take it from 
the fire and break in one egg, blend it and break in 
another, and then another, till five have been broken 
in; then in very hot lard and butter drop spoonfuls 
of this mixture and cook as fritters. When you take 
them out roll them in sugar and cinnamon, or eat with 
fairy butter, as you like.

and add the yeast. M^ke them stiff enough in the 
morning after kneading well to roll out; pinch off 
pieces as large as a walnut, roll into balls, let rise, roll 
out some, and cut in rings, or whatever form you like, 
sprinkle a clean napkin (which lay on the J)oard) or two 
slightly with flour, lay the cakes on napkins on board, 
cover lightly, let rise; roll about one-half inch thick, 
keep warm, after they are cut out, let stand from 
thirty to fifty minutes, then have ready a spider of 
boiling fat (suet is best) ; put the cakes into this fat 
upside down, that is, the side that was top on the 
napkin, should be the under side in the fat, because 
the crust which forms on top prevents them from rising. 
As soon as they rise and are brown on the under 
side slip the fork under the cake and turn. Cook them 
done through. Drain on brown paper. If you prefer 
it sift together powdered sugar, cinnamon or nutmeg, 
and sift it on cakes while hot.

DRINKS. 

TEA. 



The tea plant in its mild state is a bushy shrub, and 
sometimes a small tree, but in cultivation is kept 
dwarfed. Like other plants long in cultivation, the 
cultivation has produced several varieties. The orig- 
inal country of tea is not known. It was found 
in a wild state in Assam. It only grows in very warm 



30 The Qneen Cook Book 

climates. The Portuguese are said to have been the 
first to import tea into Europe, and were acquainted 
with it as early as the sixteenth century. In 1664 it 
is recorded that the English East India Company 
made the Queen of England what was considered the 
brilliant present of two pounds of tea. Previous 
to this, and at this time it was the custom among Eu^ 
ropean nations to make tea of hot infusions of various 
kinds of leaves, notably those of the sage (salvia), 
which at one time had a high reputation, and was 
regarded as a sort of panacea. Indeed, it is a good 
hot drink, for one who has just taken a cold. Its 
dried leaves were taken to China by the Dutch East 
India Company to be exchanged for tea. Teas are 
classed as black and green, distinctions not due 
to the production of different species, but to the age 
of the leaf when gathered, and the methods of prep- 
aration. It is raised in abundance in China, Japan, 
East Indies, and now some in California. The 
quality of the tea depends largely upon the age of the 
leaves at the time of picking. The younger the 
leaves the more delicate their flavor. There are four 
different pickings through the season. Teas of the 
cheaper kind are very much adulterated. Never buy 
the powdered tea. The best quality of black teas is 
the pekoa. The best green teas are the best Japan, 
and the gunpowder, (which are the first gatherings), are 
the best. Excessive use of tea produces wakefulness 
and increased mental and bodily activity, which is fol- 
lowed by a reaction that brings exhaustion and a cor- 
responding depression. Most of the unpleasant effects 
of tea are ascribed to the volatile oil. The long con- 
tinued breathing of air impregnated with this oil, pro- 
duces illness in the packers of tea, who press it down 
with their bare feet; and the tea tasters at the tea 



The Queen Cook Book 31 

marts in China, who are ever careful not to swallow 
the infusion, are obliged in a few years to give up their 
lucrative positions, with shattered constitutions. The 
Chinese, who drink tea at all times, are careful to use 
none less than a year old, as in that time the oil either 
evaporates or is so modified that it ceases to be 
injurious. Is it not safer not to drink tea at all, and 
healthier and more nourishing to drink milk either hot 
or cold (but do not boil) for supper 6r have a cup of 
hot cocoa, or chocolate made of milk } The best way 
to steep all kinds of tea is, take one even teaspoon of 
green tea for two cups of boiling water, after you have 
brought it just to a quick boil with two tablespoons of 
water. Black tea is coarser, take a heaping teaspoon 
for two cups and steep it the same way. The old 
custom of boiling black tea twenty minutes makes it 
blacker, but not a refreshing cup of tea. Wash and 
dry the tea steeper, tea pot, coffee boiler and coffee 
pot, every time they are used, as much as you do your 
silver; and scald them well before using. Do not use 
a metal tea pot. Green teas are an astringent. 

Cocoa. 

Cocoa or chocolate nuts are the seeds of Theobroma 
cacao, a handsome tree from fifteen to twenty feet in 
heighth growing in Mexico, the West Indies and South 
America. These seeds are roasted and ground and the 
oil partly extracted. These seeds make our cocoa. 
To make good cocoa allow one teaspoon to every cup 
of milk* Put the quantity of milk according to the 
number of persons to drink it in a double boiler. 
When it boils wet the cocoa, work it fine, put it in the 
hot milk and boil ten minutes and let it settle.

32 The Queen Cook Book 

Chocolate. 

Chocolate is the cocoa nut pounded to a paste in a 
hot mortar; mixed with sugar, starch, cinnamon and 
vanilla it forms the chocolate of commerce. To make 
good chocolate take one tablespoon of the sweetened 
grated chocolate to each cup of milk. Put the 
required quantity of milk in double boiler; when it is 
hot wet the powder fine, put it in and boil fifteen 
minutes. Serve with sweetened whipped cream, two 
tablespoons on top of each cup. 

Coffee. 

Coffee is the seed of the coffee tree which grows 
wild in southern Abyssinia and western Africa in great 
profusion, and there it has been in use from very 
remote times. It attains the height of eight to twenty 
and sometimes thirty feet. To increase its produc- 
tiveness and for convenience of gathering in cultiva- 
tion it is kept as low as five feet. Its trunk is covered 
with a grayish bark, and its white blossoms growing 
from the angles of the leaf stalk, three to four in 
number, resembling in form the jasmine blossoms, 
often suddenly appear scattered among the dark 
leaves like flakes of snow. The plant being an ever- 
green, the foliage is always fresh. Like the orange, 
it has blossoms and green and ripe fruit of every grade 
at the same time, so the ripe coffee may be gathered 
at various seasons, but the real harvests are usually 
two. The fruit when ripe becomes red and finally 
dark purple. It resembles a cherry. Each berry 
contains two seeds, their flat sides are opposed to each 
other in the center of the pulp. In the West Indies 
the fruit is picked by hand, but in Arabia, where no 
' ains prevail to beat it from the trees, it is allowed to 



The Queen Cook Book 33 

remain till ready to fall, and is then shaken off upon 
cloths spread upon the ground. Its perfect ripeness 
may be one reason of its superior quality. The cul- 
tivation ,of coffee is widely diffused throughout the 
trofics. Coffee should only be scorched thoroughly 
through to a light brown, not a dark chestnut brown. 
A slight excess of heat injures the quality of the coffee. 
Brown it in a sheet iron pan in the oven, stirring it 
often and watch it closely, about one pound at a time, 
As soon as browned empty in a tight box. 

Brown only enough at a time to last one week for 
your family. If you buy your coffee roasted do so in 
small quantities. Keep it in a tightly covered fruit jar, 
and grind just before using; grind line, not floured, as 
it is quicker settled Mocha coffee, which is known by 
its small, roundish grains, agreeable odor and flavor, 
is preferred to all others. The Java, a large, flat 
grain, is next in quality. Some like it mixed three- 
fourths Java, one-fourth Mocha, or one-half each. 
The Brazilian coffees are between the two in size and 
inferior to both in flavor. It is preferable to purchase 
coffee unroasted, as the roasted and ground are mostly 
adulterated. The darker the coffee is roasted the 
more injurious its effects. Some people can not drink 
it at all ; some can only drink it in the morning. Some 
people of a full habit can not use it because it pro- 
duces dizziness', on others it produces nervousness and 
others wakefulness. 

To Make Coffee. 

Measure one heaping tablespoonful of the berry for 
each cup, grind it fine but not like flour, then for four 
or six, stir in one-fourth of an egg, and one-half pint 
of cold water in a bowl, beat it well with a fork, put it 
in coffee boiler and add one cup of boiling water for 



34 The Queen Cook Book 

each spoonful of coffee, and let it boil slowly five min- 
utes. If there are six persons or more, add one cup of 
water extra for waste. 

To Make Coffee Without Boiling. 

An infusion made just below boiling point is thought 
by some to be much better than a decoction made 
by boiling. Purchase a coffee pot for table made with 
a cloth strainer to put your coffee in without egg, pour 
the water boiling hot upon it just as you are ready for 
breakfast. It will be ready in ten minutes. Always 
put the sugar and cream into the cup before pouring 
the coffee, the scalding of the sugar and cream enriches 
the coffee. 

Another Way of Making Coffee. 

Mix it with egg and cold water then p^ it in coffee 
pot, with boiling water on it, let soak for fifteen min- 
utes and then just come to a boil. In browning coffee 
it must be a light brown, not dark brown, or burnt. It 
should be ground fine, but not to a flour. 



SOUPS. 



Soups should be made nutritious, healthful and 
palatable, with flavoring so commingled, or delicately 
blended that no one can be detected. As every good 
cook knows the right way to use salt and pepper is to 
not have the food taste of either, but simply to give it 
strength or body. How insipid any soup would be 
without salt and pepper however rich the broth. Mrs. 
Rorer says, " The most important point in making good 
soup is to have the best of materials. To make our 
soup a perfect food we must change the solid meat 
into a liquid form ; to do this, we must first soften the 
fibrin, so as to draw out the juices and blood, consist-* 



The Queen Cook Booh 35 

ing of albumen and fat; the gelatine, which exists in 
the bone, cartilages, membranes and skin, which is 
nitrogenous matter, but not nutritious, and the osma- 
2ome, that substance which gives odor and flavor. As 
a low degree of heat changes the albumen into a solid 
form, we at once see the necessity of using cold, soft 
water. Soft water because it makes its way into the 
tissues more readily than hard water, thereby soften- 
ing the texture of the meat and allowing the juices to 
escape more easily; and we also see the importance of 
not boiling the soup, as the albumen on the surface of 
the meat immediately coagulates and prevents the 
gelatine, fat and osmazome from dissolving and being 
drawn out into the water. Have a granite iron soup 
kettle with a close cover. Why } Because the juices 
of the meat are always acid and will act upon a metal- 
lic kettle, thereby giving the soup an inky bitter taste. 
A close cover to keep in the steam and prevent evap- 
oration. " A good soup-maker (as well as a good cook) 
should be a skillful taster; keep a spoon on purpose 
for it. To make a nourishing soup one must have 
meat as well as bone. The best stock for soup is beef, 
mutton, lamb and chicken; some like a bit of ham 
added, for a change. The legs of all meats are rich 
in gelatine. Any meat soup is poor that does not jelly 
when cold. If one wishes light colored stock use 
light colored meats, such as veal or chicken. Make 
your soup stock the day before you wish to use it; let 
it stand over night, then take off all the fat (which 
simmer and cleanse for browning mush and potatoes), 
when it is ready to flavor, thicken and serye, unless 
you wish a bouillon. It is a good plan to make stock 
enough at one time for two or three days in cool 
weather, using it every other day. It gives variety 
and economizes labor. Always use fresh meats. 



36 The Queen Cook Book 

• 

Dash a dipper of cold water over the meat to cleanse 
it from specks or hairs; it takes the juices out to lay it 
in water. 

To ev^ry pound of meat and bones allow one 
quart of water, which will just about cover it nicely. 
Some authors say cut the meat in small pieces two 
inches square, keeping it at just simmering heat, but 
not boil, from four to five hours (try it), but I have 
always had good, nourishing soups by keeping it just 
at a boiling point from three to four hours, putting 
the salt in when it is first put over, it will not bear 
enough to season the meat, but just for the water; 
skim it before it boils, and wipe the sciim off that 
clings to the kettle. The goodness is all out when 
the meat is juiceless. If you wish to use the best 
pieces of the meat cold, sliced off for supper, or for a 
stew for breakfast, take out the best pieces for it in 
two hours and let the rest boil longer. Keep a tea 
kettle of hot water to add to it if needed; and also 
tightly covered. Nice additions to soups are rice, 
vermicelli, macaroni, parsley, celery, celery seeds 
and all kinds of vegetables; the first three, require 
one-half a tea cupfuU to three quarts of stock. Some 
prefer only one kind at a time. All vegetables should 
be boiled by themselves, throw the water away 
and put the vegetables through a seive. For thicken- 
ing it takes two tablespoons of flour for each quart of 
soup. As nice a soup as one needs to eat is made of 
beef stock, thickened, parsley and celery tied 
together, with croutons in the tureen. If you wish 
clear soup you can clarify it with the white of an ^^^, 
and strain it, making a perfectly clear soup, but 
stimulating rather than nutritious; as the boiling and 
straining takes away its albumen and fibrin; as we 
can not have a very clear, an4.a very nutritious soup 



The Queen Cook Book 37 

at the same time. In a family pf six or more, the 
bones and trimmings from two or more steaks, and 
from the roast beef of the day before, boiled three 
hours, will make a tolerable soup. Flavor with cel- 
ery and parsley; thicken and pour onto croutons, or 
rolled crackers. 

Croutons. 

Cut a slice of stale bread twice as thick as for 
table use, spread the top lightly with butter, then 
cut into dice, toast in oven on tin plate. 

Browning for Soups. 

Put three tablespoons of brown sugar and one 
heaping tablespoon of butter in an iron spider over 
the fire; stir all the time so it will not really burn, 
until it is of a bright brown color, and givQS forth a 
burning smell, add a half pint of hot water, boil 
and skim, when cold bottle for use; use as needed. 

To Make Caramel. 

Brown one cup of granulated sugar until it melts 
and burns, add one cup of boiling water, boil one 
minute. Bottle, cork tight. This is used for color- 
ing soups. 

Cream of Celery Soup. 

Boil twelve stalks of celery, cut in small pieces, in 
three pints of water for half an hour till tender. Add 
half an onion and two blades of mace, and pass 
through a sieve. Mix one tablespoon of flour and a 
heaping tablespoon of butter; add to the soup one 
pint of cream, salt and pepper to taste.

Gently boil the tomatoes and water one hour cov- 
ered tight, then strain. Add one even teaspoon salt, 
then the soda a part at a time, so it will not foam over, 
then the cream, milk and pepper, and pour it, after it 
comes to a boil, on four tablespoons of finely rolled 
cracker. The cream is indispensable in this soup. 

Tomato Soup (very nice), 

I quart beef stock i quart n\ilk

Heat the strained tomatoes boiling hot and put in 
soda enough to take out the acid (should say about 
two even teaspoons), stir the butter and flour to a 
cream, then add all together and boil three minutes to 
cook the flour, stirring all the time. 

Green Pea Soup.

Yolks of 2 eggs Salt and pepper to taste 

First wash your pea pods before shelling, and souse 
them well, to get the dust and sand off. Do not wash 
the peas after they are shelled as you loose the sweet 
juice that is in the inside of the pod. Shell them and 
put them into the cold water, with salt, boil about 
twenty minutes till fit for eating, according to age. 
Rub through a sieve, return to soup kettle with a pint 
or more of milk or cream. Stir butter and flour 
together smoothly then stir it in boiling soup, boil five

two tablespoons of milk to thin them and stir it in the 
soup; season. 

Green Corn Soup.

I quart of water, or mutton i tablespoon flour 

stock. Salt and pepper 

I quart milk 

Put the corn in the water cold, boil five minutes, 
scrape the milk from cob, rub flour and butter together, 
put in your milk; if you have cream, use one pint 
cream, and one pint milk; when hot stir in the worked 
butter,' salt and pepper, boil to cook the flour three 
minutes. 

Asparagus Soup. 

Wash the asparagus, using only the top about three 
inches long, tie in bunches of six or eight stalks each, 
boil in water enough to cover, with a little salt (aspar- 
agus bears less salt than any other vegetable). Boil 
six minutes and throw away the water; then put on 
the cup of water and boil till tender, then rub through 
a colander, stir the butter and flour together, put all 
together with pepper and salt, boil to cook the floiir. 
If preferred use veal stock instead of milk, with the 
cup of cream. Early asparagus boils tender very 
quickly. 

Haricot (harako) Soup. 

One and a half pints of good small white beans, 
wash and soak over night in luke-warm water. In the 
morning drain off this water, cover with fresh cold 
soft water, bring slowly to a boil for thirty minutes, 
drain off this water. Take three pounds of beef o^

a good sized shin-bone and put the beans and beef in 
four quarts of cold water, bring to a boil slowly, skim- 
ming often. Keep hot water to add as fast as it boils 
away. Slice and fry an onion and put it in with salt, six 
cloves, a dozen peppers and some parsley. Boil for 
three hours till the meat will fall from the bones. Stir 
from bottom often, and boil slowly; when cooked take 
out the meat, strain the soup, which should be four 
quarts, through a colander, mashing the beans, let no 
skins go through. If you wish it to be superfine, you 
can slice two or three hard boiled eggs and put in the 
tureen with crputons hot. Boil the eggs twelve 
minutes, then drop into cold water before peeling to 
prevent the discoloring of outside of yolk. 

Bob^ the Sea Cook. 

Plain Bean Soup. 

Prepare the beans the same as in the preceding 
with salt, and boil in soft water, one pint of beans to 
two quarts of water, boil till they all burst open very 
soft, then strain through a soup sieve; return to the 
kettle, add a little butter and pepper and boil up. For 
a change you can boil with beans two bunches of 
parsley and one of celery, and pour on croutons, and 
two hard boiled eggs sliced, and one lemon sliced, if 
liked. 

For a good beef stock for any soup or bouillon choose 
a piece of round of beef of about four pounds; have 
also three or four pounds of beef leg and bones. Put 
the leg of beef and bones in a pot with four quarts of 
cold water. Let it just boil for three hours. Then 
cut into two pieces the round of beef and put in, let 
boil altogether for three hours more; remove the piece 
of round of beef and eat plain, and dished up in some 
of the bouillon; thicken for a breakfast dish. Strain 



The Queen Cook Book 41 

the bouillon and it is ready for any kind of soup you 
wish to make. Keep water hot to add to it as it boils 
out. I should think this would make six quarts of 
rich stock, which will keep well in cold weather. The 
reason why the round is put in last, is because it 
would be overdone and tasteless if cooked the six 
hours. 

Bouillon, 

Bouillon is rich stock, made from beef with only 
pepper and salt. Use stock like the above, or buy 
soup bones, have them cracked, with meat enough on 
them for the desired quantity. To each pound of 
meat and bones put one quart and one pint of water. 
Allow one hour's boiling for each pound. Cover 
tight; only just boil, skimming as it rises. When the 
meat is separated from the bones and looks juiceless, 
take it up, strain, set in a cool place, cover; next day 
skim ofi the fat. If it is a jellied mass, it is rich 
enough. Bouillon is served in cups half full, and 
must be very hot, at fashionable lunches and at even- 
ing entertainments; it may be used to form a dinner 
soup by boiling celery and parsley in it, thickening it, 
and adding vermicelli well washed. Or make vege- 
table soup by boiling vegetables in water by themselves, 
mashing through a sieve or cutting them up as 
preferred.

meat into pieces about an inch square. Put the but- 
ter in the soup kettle and let it brown. Add to it the 
meat and stir over the fire about five minutes, or until 
the meat is a n e rown. Now, cover the kettle and 
let it simmer fo thirty minutes. Add the water and 
let simmer for four hours. Now add the vegetables 
and bay leaf and simmer one hour longer. Strain 
through a soup strainer and put in a cool place to cool. 
When cold remove the fat and it is ready to use. 
Thicken a little and pour onto croutons. (It can be 
clarified with white of egg and browned with caramel 
the same as bouillon.)

I head celery i parsnip 

1 onion, salt i sweet potato 

2 white potatoes i head parsley 

Cook the rice perfectly soft; cook all the vegetables, 
throw away the water; put them through a colander; 
salt them just right for eating. Beat the butter and 
flour to cream, first browning the butter with one tea- 
spoon of sugar; add one cup of sweet cream if you have 
it. Do not let the vegetables get cold, but stir gradu- 
ally on them the two quarts of boiling water till well 
commingled. Then boil fifteen minutes, take out the 
bunch of parsley, then add your cream and thickening 
and boil five minutes, and it is ready for the table. 

Dumpling Soup. 

Take four pounds of good lean meat, either veal or 
mutton, and only just boil in five quarts of cold water 
for three hours. Peel, slice and brown in one table- 
spoon of butter, and boil the last hour in the soup, six 
small onions. Wash and cut in half-inch pieces three 
small heads of celery and put in at same time. When it 
is done, beat well one egg, take one tablespoon of milk, 
and thicken with flour till stiff, then cut off bullet-like 
pieces and drop in the soup; let soak fifteen minutes, 
then boil five minutes; if not the right thickness add 
flour to make it creamy thickness. A little salt in the 
dumplings. Salt and pepper to taste.

30 clams 4 tablespoons butter 

3 quarts water 3 fresh eggs 

4 tablespoons flour i pint milk or cream 

Pepper and salt 
Add the native liquor to the water; bring to a boil 
and skim it. Chop up the clams very fine and stir in 
with butter and flour worked together, and boil just 
three minutes; if much boiled they will be tough; add 
thre^ fresh eggs well beaten; stir well. Pour on crou- 
tons if you like. Very delicious. 

Jenny Lind Soup. 

I J^ pounds lean veal i quart chicken broth 

3 pints water 2 cups cream 

% cup rice 4 yolks of eggs 

Pepper and salt 
Chop the lean veal fine and put into the water cold 
with salt, and simmer for two hours, or to cook the 
veal tender; do not boil. Boil the rice tender in a pint 
of water. Strain the veal broth through a soup 
strainer; add your chicken broth, rice, salt and pepper, 
and one cup of cream; beat the yolks well; add the 
other cup of cream to them. Pour on to rolled cracker. 

Ox Tail Soup. 

2 ox tails I onion, i turnip 

2 quarts cold water or stock i bay leaf, i carrot 
2 tablespoons butter 4 cloves, salt, pepper 

Wash and wipe the ox tails. Cut them in pieces 
about the fourth of an inch long. Put the butter int6 
a frying-pan; when hot, throw in the ox tails and stir 
until they turn brown, then skim them out and brown 
the onion; then put all the ingredients in the soup 



The Queen Cook Book 45 

kettle and simmer about two hours or till the tails are 
tender, removing the vegetables; season right. 



Oyster Soup. (Have good oysters.) 

50 oysters or i quart 2 heaping tablespoons but- 

I cup hot water ter 

4 tablespoons sifted rolled J^ pint each of milk and 

cracker cream 

Salt and pepper 

Pour the oysters into a colander, pour on slowly the 
cup of hot water, stirring with the hand, to take out 
the shells, and wash off all the liquor. Put the liquor 
in the soup kettle, heat slowly to let the scum 
rise; when it is near boiling skim it well, taking 
off every speck, then put in milk and cream; bring to 
a boil; put in butter; put salt and pepper on the 
oysters; set the kettle out of stove, where it will 
not boil, and pour the oysters in the kettle and 
stir lightly for ten minutes, till hot through, tasting 
to see if seasoned right, as on this depends their 
beauty with the cream. If you can not get cream, use 
milk and one tablespoon of corn starch, which must 
be cooked in the milk before adding the oysters. As 
soon as they begin to shrink pour it all slowly in the 
tureen, stirring the cracker, so it will hot be lumpy. 
Oysters must not be allowed to boil, as it makes them 
tough and tasteless. Be equally careful that the 
oysters are heated through, as an uncooked oyster in 
a hot soup is unacceptable; serve immediately. De- 
licious. 

Chicken Soup. 

For one chicken cut up, put two quarts of cold 
water; let it simmer for five hours. When half done 
add two tablespoons boiled rice, salt and pepper; 



J 



4^ The Queen Cook Book 

a spoonful of flour and butter when done. If one 
likes onions or parsley in, put them in, but I prefer the 
relishable chicken flavor. Remember to skim it well. 
Put croutons in the tureen. 

Perfect Mock Turtle Soup,

Get a fresh calf *s head; have it skinned. Clean 
out the eye and ear sockets, take out the brains, cut 
off the entire jaw, wash the head in several waters, 
let it soak for about an hour in soft water, then lay it 
in a stew pan, and cover it with cold water and add two 
quarts over; as it becomes warm a great deal of scum 
will rise, which remove as fast as it rises, let it boil 
gently for one hour, take it up, and when almost cold, 
cut the meat into pieces about an inch and a half by 
an inch and a quarter, and the tongue into mouthfuls, 
or rather make a side dish of the tongue and brains. 
When the head is taken out, put in the stock meat 
about five pounds of knuckle of veal, and the same of 
beef; add to the stock all the trimmings and bones of 
the head, skini it well, then cover it close and let it 
simmer five hours (reserve a couple of quarts of this for 
gravy stock of other meats) ; then strain it off and let 
it stand till next morning; take off the fat, set a large 
stewpan on the fire with half a pound of good fresh 
butter, two ounces of sliced onions, and one-foiurth 



The Queen Coak Boek 47 

ounce of green sage; chop fine; let these simmer one 
hour, then rub in half a pound of browned flour, by 
degrees add the broth till it is the thickness of cream : 
season it with a quarter of an ounce of finely ground 
allspice, half an ounce of black pepp^ very fine. (Salt 
it when you first put it over.) The rind of one lemon 
pealed very thin; let it simmer gently for one hour and 
a half, then strain it through a soup sieve, do not rub 
it through, but have it thin enough to shake through; 
put it in a clean stewpan with the head and season it 
by adding to. each gallon of soup four tablespoons of 
vinegar and four tablespoons of lemon juice, let it sim- 
mer gently till the meat is tender; this may take from 
half an hour to an hour; take care that it is not over 
done; stir it frequently to prevent the meat from sticking 
to the bottom of the kettle. When the meat is quite 
tender the soup is ready. A head weighing twenty 
pounds with the ten pounds of stock meat, will make 
ten quarts of excellent soup, besides the two quarts of 
stock, you have put by for gravies. You can add the 
yolks of four hard boiled eggs if you like. If there is 
more meat on the head than you wish to put in the 
soup, save it, it will make an excellent ragout or meat 
pie. If there is a good deal of meat left from the 
soup put with a cup of the stock thickened as for gravy, 
and make a crust the same as for chicken pie, and you 
have a good mock turtle pie. 

Obs. — This is a delicious soup, within the reach of 
every one. The lover of good eating will only wish 
for more when he is through. Home Messenger. 





MEATS. 

boiled meats, all fresh meats should be put in 
hot water with salt, and skimmed as often as any 
scum rises, letting it just boil and no more, covered 



48 The Queen Cook Book 

tightly; have a tea kettle of boiling water to add to it 
as it boils down. When you can pierce it easily with 
a fork it is cooked enough. For soups, put the meat 
in cold water, as you need the juices of the meat in the 
water. When you have skimmed it well, put in ja 
little cold water which will throw up the rest of the 
scum Never boil meats or soups furiously^ or fry or 
roast in that way; it destroys both the flavor and all 
, that is nutritious in anything. In roasting have your 
oven quite hot when you put it in, afterward roast 
more gently; in that way the outside pores are closed, 
and the juices of the meat will not be lost. 

A good roast is juicy in the middle and brown on the 
outside. Most people like beef and mutton under- 
done, while veal, lamb and pork should be well done. 
All meats are more tender and have a better flavor to 
be a few days old after killing, according to the 
weather, and the means of keeping it A chicken 
is never quite as good the day it is killed It is more 
tender to be from twenty-four to forty-eight hours 
killed, according to weather. 
r For boiled meats do not let the water boil for thei 
^first forty minutes. If the water boils much soone^ 
the meat will be hardened, and shrink, the slower it 
boils the more tender it will be. Count the time from 
its first coming to a boil, allowing twenty minutes to a 
pound, if gently simmere3/) Fresh killed meats will 
take somewhat longer tiip^than that which has been 
kept till what the butchers call ripe; if it be fresh 
killed it will be tough and hard if stewed ever so 
long or gently Have the meat just covered with 
water. Beef and mutton a little underdone is not a 
great fault, but lamb, pork, veal, and chicken are 
uneatable and truly unwholesome if not thoroughly 
boiled. The liquor of boiled meats will make nutri- 
tious soups. 



The Queen Cook Book 49 

To Bake Meats Etc. 

This is one of the cheapest and most convenient 
ways of dressing a dinner in small families. With 
regard to the time necessary for baking or roasting 
various meats, it will vary according to the different 
kinds of meat and its age. Everything should be 
salted when first put over to cook, except broiled beef 
steak. In selecting beef it should be of a clear, red 
color, of a fine grain, the fat firm and of a yellowish 
white. The best pieces for roasting are the ribs, sir- 
loin and pin bone. Always examine a piece of meat to 
be sure there is nothing foreign on it, such as specks 
of dirt, hairs, etc. Do not wash it if you can help it, 
but wipe it with a damp cloth. 

To Roast Beef. 

Rub the salt well in the roast; pepper, and sprinkle 
well with flour with your seive. Put it on the rack in 
the bottom of a sheet iron baking pan, the skin side 
up, do not turn it over, but turn your pan around. 
When it begins to brown, put a cup of water in the 
pan. Baste your meat with the drippings (that is, 
take a spoon and dip the gravy on the meat) every 
fifteen minutes. Have the oven quite hot at first and 
then more moderate, but have it boiling hot, adding 
water if it boils dry; do not let it burn. It must 
always be rare inside and a bright red (not whitish) 
when sufficiently cooked and well browned and crisped 
on the outside. A roast of two ribs will cook in one 
hour, if oven is right heat. A rack is made of sheet 
iron to fit loosely in the pan, the two sides bent down 
three-fourths of an inch, to stand on, to hold the meat 
up from the juices, and full of holes the size of a 
penny. Put only a little water in at a time, so as not 



JO The Queen Cook Book 

to steam the roast, which will make the meat whitish. 
Take it up when cooked to your liking, the gravy 
being browned, pour off the excess of fat, if there is 
too much fat, and add water according to the quan- 
tity of meat; salt and thicken with flour as thick as 
thick cream. One great beauty of all meats is to have 
the right proportion of salt, and not have it taste of 
salt. To be a good cook you must taste and see. 
Beef roasted in front of an old-fashioned fire-place 
has a finer flavor than in a oven. 

Yorkshire Pudding. 

I quart sweet milk Salt, even teaspoon 

8 even tablespoons flour, 6 eggs 

sifted twice 

This pudding is to be cooked and eaten with this 
previous roast. Beat the eggs very light separately, 
stir the yolks and salt in the milk, then stir the milk 
gradually in the flpur beating it eight minutes. Then 
add the beaten whites. Thirty minutes before the 
roast is done take it out of pan, and the rack out, pour 
the gravy out, and pour the pudding in the meat pan, 
lay wires three or four across the top of pan on which 
place the meat. Do this as quickly as possible and 
place in quite hot oven again for twenty-five or thirty 
minutes. In the meantime prepare your meat-gravy 
for table, as everything else must be ready for table 
when the pudding is baked. Take up the meat and 
slide the pudding out on a platter, cut it in squares 
when helping. Keep it hot till after carving is done. 
This is enough for eight or ten persons. If there are 
only four or five persons, make half of it. 

Fillet of Beef. 

The fillet is the tenderloin of beef. They are of vari- 
ous sizes, and weigh from three to eight pounds. 



The Queen Cook Book Jl 

Make gashes in it and insert several finger strips of 
nice fat salt pork; cut off the rind. Take off the thick 
sinewy skin from the tenderloin. Salt, pepper and 
flour it, put a little suet and a few strips of pork in 
bottom of pan and a small cup of stock, or hot water 
to baste it with. It will bake in three-fourths of an 
hour; serve with any sauce or catsup you have, with 
Saratoga or Julien potatoes. 

Beef ala Mode* 

Take a slice about four inches thick from the round 
of beef, it may weigh seven or eight pounds, remove 
the bone, have ready finger strip, of nice fat salt pork, 
and some nice turkey dressing (stuffing of bread) cut 
deep gashes into the meat, but be careful not to cut 
through, rub on the salt. Mix a half teaspoon of 
black pepper, same of cinnamon, quarter of a teaspoon 
of mace, the same of cloves, and rub them into the 
meat on both sides, sprinkling a little in each gash. 
Put one piece of pork and as much of the dressing, as 
it will hold when rolled up. (Add onion and parsley to 
the dressing if you like and vinegar.) Mix three table- 
spoons of vinegar with three of butter and moisten 
well both sides of the meat, then roll it together and 
fasten around it a piece of sheer muslin, sewing up 
the ends. Let stand over night. Then put two large 
tablespoons of butter into a pan, and when melted and 
hot, add one onion, one carrot and one turnip cut into 
slices; stir the whole until lightly browned, then add 
two tablespoons of vinegar, two bay leaves, a sprig of 
parsley, and two quarts of boiling water or stock; let 
the whole boil two minutes; then put in the beef and 
one knuckle of veal well cracked. Put on the cover 
to keep in the steam, and p~ t in the oven and bake 
slowly for six hours, oven quite hot, When done take 



52 The Queen Cook Book 

out the meat and stand away to cool. Strain the 
liquor, add salt and pepper to taste, and turn into a 
square dish to harden. This will make a jelly of a 
bright amber color. Serve the meat cold with squares 
of the jelly around it. Garnish with parsley. Serve 
with any meat sauce or mayonnaise sauce. In winter 
this will keep at least two weeks in a cold place, cov- 
ered. 

Broiled Beef Steak 

The cuts for broiling are porterhouse, sirloin, ten- 
derloin, and rump or round. First, plan to have good 
hot coals; heat the gridiron made of wire; rub it with 
suet. Have your steak thick, from three-fourths to an 
inch thick; you can not make a juicy steak out of a 
thin one. Pound it with a large hammer to make it 
tender, put no salt on it; lay it on the gridiron and 
cover with a tight fitting sheet iron cover (that is, 
fits the opening of the hearth), warm the platter, 
take it up every three minutes (being careful not to 
lose its juices on the coals, but in the platter (by run- 
ning two knives under); double it on the warm platter, 
press a few times with your knife, turn it every time 
you take it up, and so on for three or four times; it 
will cook in ten or twelve minutes. It must be rare 
inside. Lay it on platter, salt, butter and pepper 
both sides, just enough to give it a flavor. Set it in 
the oven for half a minute, and serve. Some prefer not 
to pound it, but there are but few steaks that are ten- 
der without it. It must be eaten immediately to be 
at its best. The family had better wait a few minutes 
for the steak, than to have the steak wait for them. 
If you burn coal use a folding gridiron. 



The Queen Cook Book 5rf 

To Fry a Round or Tough Steak. 

Heat the spider hot, pound the steak well, . oalt both 
lay it in spider, cover tight, turn every half min- 
ute (watch it closely that it does not burn), but cook 
fast; it will cook rare in five or seven minutes; butter 
it both sides - and^pe ^^^;- take it up, put in water 
enough to make a gravy and pour over it. Always see 
that your gravies ar« nicely seasoned. 

Beef Croquettes. 

Take one pound of cold beef left from roast or 
steak, cut off all gristle or skin, hash it fine enough to 
adhere. Add the same quantity of fine rolled cracker, 
or grated bread crumbs; gravy or milk to moisten, 
two eggs, season to taste with butter, salt and pepper; 
lemon and onion if you like. Let stand till it swells, 
then make up in oblong flat rolls; brown in spider with 
half butter and half suet, as you would brown potato 
balls. Do not dry them up, as then they are cooked 
too much. 

A Flank of Beef. 

The flank of beef is a part generally unknown to 
housekeepers, but if properly cooked and seasoned it 
makes an exceedingly good dish. The flank is the part 
between the ribs and the hip. Have about four 
pounds of the flank cut in a strip twice as long as it is 
wide, wipe with a wet cloth, trim off the gristle, sea- 
son with salt and pepper, spread it with a layer of tur- 
key dressing as thick as it will roll, roll it compactly 
and tie it tightly in shape with cord; brown it in a 
saucepan with sufficient hot drippings of suet and but- 
ter to keep it from sticking. When it is brown all 
over cover it with boiling water. Add salt and pepper 



54 The Qmeen Cook Book 

a little as the water will boil down; keep covered all 
the time from first to last, boiling slowly for about 
three hours till tender, or Just gravy enough for the 
meat; thicken and serve. Boiled rice is nice served 
with it, or boiled onions. Serve with tomato pickle or 
chow chow. 

Stuffed Roast Beef. 

For a change have a piece of the ribs boned by the 
butcher. Prepare a nice turkey dressing. Unroll the 
beef; spread the dressing as thick as it will admit; roll 
it up, tie it firmly and roast as other roast beef. A 
joint of beef boned can be prepared the same way. 
This requires more gra>'y than a usual roast. Slice it 
around, not lengthwise. This can be boiled if you like. 

Scalloped Meat. 

Lamb« mutton or chicken make nice dishes scal- 
loped. Chop nicely, taking out all refuse bits; season 
to taste. HaN-c half as much rolled cracker or grated 
hrt^d cruml>$ as meat. Put in your baking dish 
V»lrx.\\dy buttonxi^ a la\xr of meat, then a layer of

pan and bake an hour. Eat cold, sliced thin, veal of 
lamb is prepared in the same way and is better. 

Boiled Meat with Robert Sauce. 

Take any meat which has been previously used 
for soup, cut into fillets or bits, and warm up well in 
the following: Robert sauce, slice a large onion and 
brown in a large tablespoonful of butter, add soup 
stock and season as you need for the meat, and sim- 
mer for five minutes. The soup meat for this should 
not have all its goodness boiled out of it. 

Spiced Beef^ 

Take ten pounds of beef from the fore quarter. 
Take one pint of salt, one cup brown sugar, one table- 
spoon ground cloves, allspice and pepper, and 
two tablespoons of powdered saltpeter; rub thoroughly 
with the mixture. Turn and rub each side twice a 
day for one week. Then wash off the spices, put it 
in boiling water, and only just boil on the back of the 
stove for five hours. Add more water as it needs. 
Press under a heavy weight (in the liquor) till cold, 
and you will never desire to try corned beef of the 
butcher again. Your pickle will do for another ten 
pounds of beef; first rubbing into it a handful of salt. 
It can be renewed and a piece kept in preparation 
every week. This is good to pickle tongues also. 

Meat Pie. 

Cold scraps of mutton, lamb or veal, cut in small 
bits, cooked in a gravy seasoned ready for eating, line 
the sides and bottom of pan with pie crust or biscuit 
dough, then put in the meat, cover the top with 
dough one-third of an inch thick, having the under 



56 The Queen Cook Book 

crust twice as thick as for a pie. As soon as the 
crust is cooked through it is ready to eat. 

Corned Beef IJash. 

Boil the beef just tender, let get cold, save fat that 
rises on the liquor when cold. You can not make 
good hash out of tough, or poor corned beef, nor over- 
boiled potatoes. To each cup of hashed corned beef, 
add what would make two cups of hashed cold boiled 
potatoes, and chop in the meat, put in the spider 
with a little of the fat, and water enough to moisten, 
adding as it boils out; season as needed. Let ft 
slowly boil for half an hour or more, not stirring but 
scraping it up often till it is somewhat glutinous, then 
let brown on the bottom. Dish it and sprinkle pepper 
on top. Corn beef hash rightly made is a nice winter 
breakfast dish with the relish of gooseberry catsup, 
and nicely cooked buckwheat cakes. 

Fresh Meat Hashes. 

The poor ends of steaks fried, or any bits of meat 
can be hashed and cooked a little in a gravy and put 
on bread or buttered toast, is another breakfast dish. 
Mutton, lamb or veal can be used in the same way. 
Fresh meats are not as good eating to have potatoes 
hashed with them. 

Dried Beef Cooked — Tea Dish. 

Take one-half pound of thin sliced dried beef (the 
grocer will slice it for you) pull it into smaller pieces, 
put it in stew pan vvith nearly a quart of milk and one- 
half cup of cream, or one spoon of butter, when boil- 
ing hot thicken wi ch flour, and only let it boil enough to 
cook the flour; if it boils longer it will be tough. Lay 
as many half slices or slices of bread on your platter 



The Queen Cook Book 57 

as you desire and pour the beef on the bread; sprinkle 
top with pepper. 

Beef Tea for Invalids. 

To one pound of lean beef (the sirloin is best) cut 
in little finger strips, put one coffee cup of cold water, 
a very little salt; set your dish in hot water; as soon 
as it is warm (wash your hands) and squeeze the meat 
with the right hand till the meat is perfectly white 
through, then take it out, and strain it through a 
coarse sieve. It is ready for use when you heat it 
quite hot, by setting the cup in hot water for a few 
minutes, a little more than blood heat, for any higher 
temperature would destroy all the nourishment; so do 
not let the blood congeal. 

Another Beef Tea. 

Though I have not found it so good. Take sirloin of 
beef, cut it in two inch pieces, a little salt; put it on grid- 
iron over hot coals, just to let the heat strike through 
it but not cook it. Then squeeze out the juice till 
white with a lemon squeezer. 

Scraped Beef Sandwiches. 

• 

Take a thick piece of beef scrape with a sharp knife 
the required quantity, season with pepper and salt, 
stir with a fork, slice the bread thin and spread the 
beef thin between, cut into damty bits of different 
shapes and serve on a tiny napkm. Some invalids 
prefer the taste of toasted bread. In that case slice 
the bread a trifle thicker, and when the sandwiches 
are made, toast the outsides quickly and lightly. 



58 The Queen Cook Book 



Beef Balls. 

The beef is prepared and seasoned as for sand- 
wiches, rolled between the hands into balls the size of 
marbles; heat a tin plate hissing hot, rub it with salt, 
then shake off the salt, place on the balls and toss 
until lightly seared. 

Raw Beef Cakes. 

Make the scraped seasoned beef into little cakes 
about half an inch thick, grease the broiler slightly, 
and broil the cakes until they begin to change color. 

Cold Pressed Beef. 

Take four or more pounds of a brisket of beef (a 
brisket of beef is that part of the breast that lies next 
to the ribs) fresh or salt, if fresh rub with salt and 
flour, after removing the bones (the butcher will do 
this) tie it tightly in a cloth, then put it in a kettle of 
boiling hot water, a little salt in the water as needed. 
Simmer gently for four or five hours; when done place 
it between two plates, put a heavy weight upon it 
over night, when it will be ready for thin slicing. 
Always remember the skimming of boiled meat. If 
this is fresh meat, the broth is good for soup. 

A Nice Brine to Pickle Beef. 

For I GO pounds beef 6 quarts common salt 

4 pounds brown sugar 4 ounces saltpetre 

Powder the saltpetre in a mortar at the druggists, 
then mix all well together, then rub the mixture all 
over each piece of beef; let it lie overnight, then pack 
close in jars or a good beef barrel, a layer of mixture 
and a layer of beef alternately. Put a board and 



The Queen Cook Book 59 

and a heavy weight on top ; cover closely. Shake the 
barrel every day for a week, then once a week. If it 
does not make brine enough of its own juices in a few 
days to cover the meat, pour on water that has 
been boiled (when cold) to cover the meat, then pour 
the brine all off, stir well and pour it back. If 
any scum rises skim it all off before shaking. 
The pieces for drying will be salt enough in three and 
a half weeks, and for eating. When purchasing a 
quarter of beef for corning for winter use, be careful 
to select a tender beef of the right age, about 7 or 
more years old. A young beef is always tough. 
November is the best month to salt beef. Follow 
directions for selections of beef for table, under the 
the head of baked meats. Beef should be killed three 
or four days before salting, according to weather. 

Mutton and Lamb. 

To roast a leg of either lamb or mutton, it is 
prepared the same as beef, only it is improved by 
making incisions and placing within finger strips 
of salt pork; baste every fifteen minutes. Roast 
twelve minutes for every pound of lamb^ and fifteen 
for every pound of mutton. The outside must be 
brown and crisp. Make a gravy; serve with green 
peas, pickles and currant jelly. 

A Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

Put it in boiling water just enough to cover it, boil 
slowly fifteen minutes for every pound. When done, 
have just water enough to make the drawn butter of. 
Serve with spiced pickles and jam. 

Fore Quarter of Lamb, Roasted. 

Have the butcher take out the leg bone and shoul- 
der blade (which yoy can take home toward a soup) 



60 The Queen Cook Book 

stuff the cavity with turkey dressing, tie it up, season- 
ing right. Bake twelve minutes to the pound. Place 
it on the frame and have only a little water in pan, 
so as to let the gravy brown when it is baked, then 
add water and make the gravy. 

Fore Quarter Lamb, Broiled. 

This is the most delicious method of cooking lamb. 
Choose a young and tender, but small fore quarter; 
have it well nicked by the butcher; and forty minutes 
before dinner place it on the gridiron over bright 
coals, but not too hot; every ten minutes baste it on 
both sides with a bit of butter and turn on the gridiron; 
send it to table just off the fire and well buttered; it 
will make its own gravy; it should be done thoroughly, 
that is, past the pink color demanded by French 
cooks, but not enough to dry the natural juices of the 
meat. Home Messenger. 

Lamb Chops. 

Lamb chops can be fried or broiled, not cooked 
hard, but browned, salted, peppered and buttered. 
Can make a gravy for the fried chops. 

Roast Leg of Veal. 

Prepared the same as lamb, only it requires longer 
and more thorough cooking and is always better to 
lay bits of salt pork in bottom of pan, or gash it in. 
Make a gravy of the brown drippings. 

Veal Cutlets. 

For veal cutlets it should be cut one-half inch 
thick from the leg, cut in right sizes for helping, have 
a spoonful of lard and butter each in a hot spider; lay 
in the veal and cook well, brown on both sides^ salt 



The Queen Cook Book 6i 

and pepper the veal first, then dip in beaten egg and 
rolled cracker; lay it in spider and brown again. Make 
a gravy. 

Pickled Tongue Boiled. 

Wash it and put it in a kettle of cold water, 
boil gently three or four hours, till when you 
pierce it with a fork it is tender; then take out and 
skin it, trimming off the roots. Do not let the water 
boil out. When cold slice it thin, place it on platter, 
the pieces overlapping each other all around the platter; 
put in the center nasturtium flowers or seeds, and 
parsley around the edge. A nice supper dish. It is 
also nice \/armed up in milk gravy. 

Jellied Tongue. 

Boil until tender a pickled beef tongue. When 
cooked throw into cold water for a few minutes, then 
peel. Saye a pint of the liquor which the tongue was 
boiled in. When the tongue is perfectly cold slice 
thin as for the table and half hash it. Dissolve two 
ounces of gelatine in one pint cold water. Plan to 
cook a piece of veal the same day or day before, so as 
to have the gravy. Take one teacup of the gfavy, two 
tablespoons of light brown sugar, add to the gravy 
three tablespoons of vinegar or juice of one lemon, 
one pint of liquor the tongue was cooked in, the dis- 
solved gelatine and a pint of boiling water. Strain 
through a fine sieve and set in cold water till it begins 
to thicken. Take a jelly mold and put in a layer of 
jelly, then a layer of tongue and then of jelly, and so 
on till all is in. Set it on ice over night to get solid. 
When you are ready to use it, dip the' mould in hot 
water quickly and turn out on platter. Garnish with 
parsley or any soft fine green. This makes a hand- 
some dish for lunch or tea. Cut it with a sharp knife. 



62 The Queen Cook Book^ 

Jellied Chicken. 

Take one or two chickens according to number of 
persons; cut up as for fricassee chicken; cook slowly 
with just water enough to cover, till very tender; sea- 
son as for eating; take up the chicken; boil the liquor 
till it will jelly thick when cold. Pick the meat to 
pieces; cut in small pieces; seg^on with salt, pepper 
and a little butter while hot, and then put a layer of 
each in the mold alternately when just cool; then set 
it in the cold to harden. To use on table cut in slices 
with sharp knife. 

Glazed Pigeons. 

Pluck, singe, draw, and wash lightly (do not lay 
them in water, but rinse off) rub in the salt, and brown 
both sides in a hot spider, with half butter and half 
suet for a few minutes, then put them in your kettle 
with the browned butter, add enough hot water to 
cover them, season just right and cook gently until 
tender, one or more hours, according to age, tightly 
covered; when cooked remove the cover and let boil 
rapidly (taking the birds out, being careful not to 
break them) till the broth is rich enough to jell when 
cold. Add a little cream and thicken. Serve the 
pigeons on a platter, pour the sauce over them. Serve 
with the ordinary sour orange now so abundant and 
cheap, cut in pieces (not slices) around the core, after 
peeling, and take out the seeds, sprinkle well with 
sugar or any salad dressing you like. They are nice 
to serve with any game or poultry. 

Baked Pigeons. 

Clean the birds as directed before, season, stuff 
with a nice turkey dressing adding a little fine chopped 



The Queen Cook Book 63 

salt, pork, place them compactly in your baking pan, 
with thin slices of salt pork on top, three, say, to 
season, dredge with flour and nearly cover with hot 
water, cover tight and place in a moderately hot oven 
till tender. If the birds are old and tough, this is the 
best way to cook them, but it will take two or three 
hours. Add cream to gravy and thicken. Add water 
while baking as needed. 

To Dress •Turkey and Chicken. 

Take your fowls from the roost at night, without 
frightening or injuring them. Take them by the feet, 
place the neck on a stick of wood and with an ax cut 
off the head with one blow. Hang it up by the feet 
till it stops bleeding. It is best killed three or four 
days before using, in winter, and twenty-four hours or 
more in summer, according to your convenience for 
keeping it. If one has ice, it is a great help. 

THprpugh bleeding renders the meat of fowls whiter. 
I have often, wondered why some chickens purchased 
at market were so dark. They probably killed them 
without bleeding. Scald them well by dipping them 
twice in a pail of boiling hot water and giving them a 
shake in it quickly. Be careful not to scald too much 
so as to set the feathers, as then it will tear the skin. 
Place the fowl on a board taking hold of its head, pull- 
ing the feathers in the direction they naturally lie. 
Remove all the pin feathers with a knife run under and 
your thumb on top. Singe the hairs but do not smoke 
over a blazing paper. Cut off the legs a little below 
the knee; remove the oil bag above the tail which is 
small and yellow; take out the crop by making a little 
slit in front, being careful to remove the gullet and 
wind pipe. Cut out the vent and cut a place or slit 



64 The Queen Cook Book 

long enough to put in your two fingers of the right hand, 
and detach all the intestines and lights, being careful 
not to break the gall sack which is attached to the 
liver, situated near the upper part of the breast bone. 
If this breaks you must not cook anything it touches, 
and you must throw the liver away. 

Now wash the inside well and quickly; rub inside 
and out with salt and it is ready for the dressing. 

Turkey Dressing. 

Take as many slices of stale bread as you need to fill 
your turkey (according to size). For a turkey of eight 
pounds perhaps six large slices, cut thicker than for 
table, or eight of baker's loaves, cut off all crusts and 
spread with good butter as you would for eating; cut it 
into strips and chop it fine with a chopping knife. 
Season with a little salt, pepper and sage. Dry the 
sage in the tin on the stove slowly, rub it very fine and sift 
it on the bread, enough to give it a good flavor; beat 
two eggs and stir in with just hot water or milk enough 
to moisten so it will cling together somewhat. If in 
the season of oysters, it improves it very much to add 
a large pint lightly chopped, taking out the hard lobes. 
Stir well together and make good use of your tasting 
powers. Stuff the body lightly full, do not pack it. It 
must have room to swell, or it will be heavy. To have 
good dressing you must u-.e light bread. Stale baker's 
bread sliced and dried in the oven and grated on a 
coarse grater makes the nicest and lightest dressing, 
then stir in two tablespoons of butter with the other 
ingredients. By stale bread I mean two or more days 
old. You can use onion or sage or any other flavor- 
ing you like for the dressing.

To Roast a Turkey. 

The dressing adds very much to the flavor of the 
turkey as well as keeping it plump. Stuff the body 
then the crop and sew it up with a coarse thread; then 
truss it by turning the tips of the wings under the 
shoulder (they will stay themselves); then tie the legs 
down to the rump with cord, tight. Of course you 
have rubbed it inside and out with salt before stuffing. 
Put it on the rack in your dripping pan on its back, 
after you have rubbed the outside with butter. Put 
water in pan, not enough to cover rack or you will 
have a par-boiled turkey, a little salt in water, and 
baste it every fifteen minutes. Do not burn it, but it 
it may get brown a little in three-fourths of an 
hour. Then make a stiff dough of flour and water, a 
little salt, and roll out the dough one-half inch thick^ 
large enough to cover the top and sides of turkey; 
leave it on till about done, then lift it off and baste 
again, and have the top and sides a nice crisp brown. 
Keep hot water in tea kettle to replenish as the water 
boils out. If too fat dip it off of gravy and thicken 
with flour, making the quantity according to size of 
turkey. An eight or nine pound turkey will roast in 
two hours. A fourteen-pound will take three or more 
hours. If you like you can boil the giblets (that is, 
the liver, heart and gizzard) till tender, hash fine and 
add to gravy. Allow twenty minutes' time for every 
pound of turkey and twenty minutes longer. A young 
hen turkey is the best for roasting. It should be 
plump and fat, the legs black, the skin white and 
short neck. If old the legs will be reddish and rough. 
A gobbler, if young, will have black legs and short 
spurs. They are much larger than a hen at same age. 
The flesh of aA old gobbler is strong and tough, legs 



66 The Queen Cook Book 

reddish and long spurs, and the grizzly end of breast 
bone will be hard and sharp, the same as in an old 
chicken. You can not give it the flavor of a young 
turkey. Serve with cranberry sauce, pickles, sweet 
potatoes and fried oysters. Fry the oysters while the 
turkey is being carved, as a cold oyster is not relisha- 
ble. 

To Boil a Turkey, or Steam It. 

Dress and prepare it the same as for roasting. Rub 
it with lemon, sprinkle with flour, tie it up in a sheer 
cloth with cord; put it into boiling hot water, after stir- 
ring up two tablespoons of flour in a little milk^ add- 
ing one quart of milk and the flour to the water, salt 
also; let it simmer, not boil hard, till tender. Stir the 
water four times as the flour settles. This preserves 
the juices of the fowl, which makes it more nourish- 
ing. Make a drawn butter of the liquor. 

Cold Roast Turkey. 

Is nice sliced off for tea, or warmed in the gravy 
for breakfast, or made in croquettes. 

To Prepare Giblets. 

Cut the gall bladder (being careful not to break it) 
from the liver and throw it in the fire or bury it. Cut 
the heart open, remove the clotted blood. • Cut the 
gizzard open to the inner lining, but do not cut it, 
drawing the meat froth it. Wash and they are ready 
to boil till tender, salt. 

Chickens. 

Chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and all birds, are 
cleaned, dressed and trussed in the^same manner as 
turkeys, according as you wish to broil, fry, or roast. 



The Queen Cook Book 67 

Select a chicken with firm flesh, yellow skin and legs. 
If young, the cock will have short spurs, and cock and 
hen will both have soft smooth legs, and tender skin. 
The small end of breast bone will be gristly and not 
a sharp bone. A chicken not full grown has not a 
good flavor. A chicken six months or more old is best 
for broiling. They should be drawn or emptied as soon 
as killed and hung in the coolest place, if cold weather, 
two or three days. 

Roast Chicken. 

Prepare it for roasting in the same way as a tur- 
key, allowing fifteen minutes to every pound, basting 
every fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes before it is 
done, rub it with butter, sprinkle with flour, let 
brown, make a gravy, adding a cup of cream, using the 
giblets if you like. 

Boiled or Steamed Chicken. 

Prepare it and boil it the same way as a turkey 
to eat with boiled rice. 

To Broil Spring Chicken. 

Singe and clean the outside taking off the head and 
feet, split the chicken down the back, taking out the 
internals. Break the breast bone, so it will lie flat. 
Rub both sides with butter and salt. Rub the gridiron 
with suet, lay the chicken on; the inside down, and 
have a close sheet iron cover, and not very hot coals, 
renewing them twice. When it is over half done turn 
it and let it brown. It will take from thirty to forty- 
five minutes to broil, with a steady heat. It must not 
burn. Take it up, rub a little butter on it and 
sprinkle with pepper. Serve immediately. 



68 The Queen Cook Book 

Chicken with Cream. 

Take a spring chicken and prepare it the sam^ is 
for broiling, place it skin side up, on the rack of 
roasting pan, with a little water salted, and covered. 
When just done, brush it over with beaten ^gg and 
sprinkle with rolled cracker, and let it brown; make 
a cream gravy and put in gravy boat. 

Fried Chicken. 

You can cut it up as for fricassee chicken and fry, or 
butter it and put in oven in dripping pan to bake and 
brown, or cut it up and cook it the same as chicken 
with cream, only put the cream, on the chicken platter. 

Fricassee Chicken, White. 

Singe and dress the chicken as directed, first dis- 
joint the legs at each joint, then the two wings making 
six pieces. Cut through the ribs on both sides break- 
ing off the lower back. Disjoint the neck and upper 
back from the breast, cut the breast in half length- 
wise, smoothly in two pieces, make two pieces of 
lower back. Salt and put in kettle and cover with 
boiling: water, and just boil only till tender, an hour or 
more according to age. When the chicken is done, 
there should be nearly water enough for gravy by the 
addition of a cup of milk, or a half cup of cream, and 
a little butter if the chicken is not fat. Pepper. 
You can put on bread or biscuit split if you like. 
Some like finger strips of salt pork cooked with 
it. Serve with boiled rice. 

Fricassee Chicken, Brown. 

Prepare the same as the above only brown your 
flour and butter for the gravy, and brown the chicken 



The Queen Cook Book - 69 

in the butter and put it back in kettle and thicken 
with the brown flour. 

Chicken Pot Pie. 

Prepare and cook the chickens the same as for 
fricassee ready for table, only have more broth for 
gravy. When the chicken is within twenty-five min- 
utes of being done, stir up stiff enough to cut off with 
spoon, baking powder biscuit, what you need; drop in 
steamer on top of chicken. Steam thirty minutes; 
take up, thicken gravy, pour some on platter over the 
chicken, put the rest in gravy dish. 

Baked Chicken Pie. 

Make a fricassee of two chickens and thicken, cook 
and season all ready for table. Then line the sides 
and bottom of your baking pan (all in one piece of 
crust), with a good pie crust one-fourth of an inch 
thick. Put in the chicken hot, with part gravy and 
cover with crust a little thicker. As soon as the crust 
is baked it is done. Put it on table in same dish. 
Have some gravy in gravy dish, for crust at table. 
This is always nice to have with roast turkey on 
Thanksgiving day, and if a large table it helps the tur- 
key to go farther. Remember, the right seasoning 
with pepper and salt is the beauty of meats. 

Chicken Salad. 

Cut up two tender chickens, salt as for eating, and 
put in boiling water, enough to hardly cover, cook till 
tender, take all the bones out while hot, let get cold, 
then cut in small bits like large peas and the celery 
the same with a silver knife. Have one-half as much 
celery as chicken, in measure, that is, to one quart of 
chicken, one pint of celery. Mix them together and 



^O 714^ Queen Cook Book 

cover tight to exclude all the air. You can prepare 
this and the salad dressing in the fore part of the day 
for the evening. The broth that is left will make a 
nice little soup. 

Salad Dressing. 

Boil six eggs eight minutes, then drop them one 
minute into cold water (which prevents the outside of 
yolk from turning green). Rub the mealy yolks 
smooth with a silver spoon and in an earthen dish, add 
gradually, beating well, one even teaspoon of Salt the 
last thing, six tablespoons of softened butter; two even 
teaspoons of mustard, twelve tablespoons of vinegar. 
Melt more butter than you need, so as not to use the 
froth and settlings. This will thicken as you stir in or 
drop in the vinegar; if too thick stir in more vinegar 
and butter. When nearly ready to use it, mix care- 
fully with a silver fork; this dressing, with the salad, 
arrange nicely in a salad bowl, garnished with parsley. 

Chicken Croquettes. 

Cook one four pound chicken tender as for eating; 
take out all th& bones, skin and gristle. When cold 
chop fine, add one fourth as much rolled cracker, or 
bread crumbs as you have meat by measure; one-half 
pint of cream or milk, boiling hot, or the hot broth of 
chicken, enough to make it just moist, to cling together 
nicely and swell the crumbs, a heaping tablespoon of 
butter, two well-beaten eggs; season. Stir well to- 
gether, and make up in cone-shaped balls, flatten a 
little, then dip in beaten egg, and then in rolled 
cracker, and fry a light brown on both sides in spider, 
with half butter and half suet. Do not dry them up 
by cooking too fast, as this destroys the nourishing 
juices of any thing. Most recipes say cook them in 



The Queen Cook Book 71 

boiling lard, but they are not so healthy. It might do 
in boiling hot suet. Serve with a napkin on platter, 
and garnish with parsley or celery tops and half quar- 
ters of lemon. 

Chicken and Oyster Croquettes. 

These are made the same way with the addition of 
one pint of oysters to every pint of chicken. Wash 
the oysters in as little hot water as possible, which 
scald with the oyster broth, and skim, then use it to 
moisten the croquettes instead of milk or cream, as far 
as it will go. Take out the hard lobes of the oyster, 
season with salt and pepper, chop raw, lightly, then 
mix with the chicken. 

Meat Croquettes. 

Cold roast chicken, turkey, lamb, or beef, can be 
prepared in the same manner, taking out all the hard 
bits, for meat croquettes. 

Tender Chicken. 

" After a fowl is killed by cutting off its head, hang 
it in a cool place until it becomes cold; keep it one, 
two or three days, according to weather; it is then as 
tender as it ever will be, and the flavor will never be 
better; no further keeping will ever improve it. This 
advice should be heeded by those housewives who pre- 
cipitate a chicken from the hen-coop to the dinner-pot 
when company comes unexpectedly and then wonder 
why the chicken is so tough, or lacking in the best 
flavor." Those who keep chickens can try it. 

Pork. 

Pork is considered more indigestible than any other 
meaty and should not be eaten by persons of weak 



72 The Queen Cook Book 

digestion or by young children. It is particularly 
injurious to any one that is liable to any skin disease. 
It is best used in cold weather, and should be 
thoroughly cooked. In healthy pork the lean is of a 
fine grain and pale red color, the fat white and the 
skin smooth. If the flesh is soft, the fat of a yellow- 
ish white with small kernels, it is diseased pork, do 
not eat it under any circumstances. It is the way the 
pig and hog is fed that causes diseased pork. Many 
people think any slops they can pick up round town is 
good enough for a pig, no matter how old it may be. 
No wonder there is trichina in pork. Feed them as 
if you were a rational being appointed to care for 
them and keep their pens clean, take the same fore- 
thought and care of them as one ought of his chickens 
or cow, and you will be rewarded accordingly. 

Roast Leg of Fresh Pork. 

Wash and scrape the rind, salt and sprinkle with 
flour if you like; first take out the bone and fill the 
cavity with turkey dressing. Gash the rind in half 
inch squares. Roast in hot oven from three to four 
hours, according to size. Dip off the fat, add water 
and make the gravy. Serve with onions and apple 
sauce. 

Roast Loinqof Pork. 

Roast a loin the same way, with or without dress- 
ing. Bake twenty minutes to the pound and twenty 
minutes longer. Serve with apple fritters. 

Roast Spare Rib. 

Crack the ribs across the middle, double together, 
fill in with turkey dressing, rub with salt, sprinkle with 
pepper and flour, sew it up, put it on the rack of drip- 



The Queen Cook Book 73 

ping pan, when one side is brown turn it and brown 
the other, pour off the fat and make a gravy; or roast 
plain. 

Pork Tenderloins. 

Split them in two or three slices for they swell very 
much in cooking, salt and pepper and fry brown in 
drippings, cook thoroughly and make a gravy. 

Pork Steaks and Chops. 

This is simply to salt and fry in the spider, 
thoroughly cooking till a nice brown on both sides; take 
out the meat, add water, salt and pepper; thicken 
with flour. 

Fried Salt Pork. 

Cut sliceis one-third of an inch thick (freshen if too 
salt), , fry brown, pour off if too fat, make a milk 
gravy. 

Boiled Ham. 

First soak it over night in just warm water. Wash 
and scrape it, place over a slow fire, not to boil, for 
two hours, with plenty of water, then place it on the 
stove where it will just boil till a fork goes in easily. 
If it is a whole ham it will take six or seven hours, ac- 
cording to size; let it stand till cold in liquor. Then 
take up and peal off the skin, rub over it beaten egg 
and sprinkle fine rolled cracker all over it and place in 
oven till it browns nicely. Then stick the top with 
cloves. Make a paper ruffle for the shank bone. A 
large porcelain kettle is the best to boil it in. Letting 
it stand in its own liquor till cold, with cover off, 
renders it more tender, juicy and of fine flavor, if it 
was good to b^gin with. 



74 The Queen Cook Book 



Cold Boiled Ham. 

It can be used in other ways, besides slicing off cold. 
Slices can be dipped in egg batter and fried, or the 
scraps can be hashed and stirred into an egg omelet, 
or scrambled eggs; or hash some and season right 
(not too much as they do at restaurants), with 
mustard, salt, and pepper for ham sandwiches. 

Fried Ham and Eggs. 

I do not think it very eatable; it is so hard, but the 
eggs are very relishable fried in the ham fat. This is 
one way, cut the slices not quite one-half of an inch 
thick, trim off the rind and all that is discolored. 
Heat the spider hot and lay in the slices of ham. As 
they brown on one side turn and brown the other 
side, then pour over the ham a few tablespoonfuls of 
boiling water, how many will depend on the quantity 
of ham. Cover the spider closely, and set where the 
heat is slow for fifteen minutes. The water by that 
time should all be absorbed and the ham delicious. 



To Bake a Ham. 

Many persons have never thought of baking a ham. 
This is the way they do it down in old Virginia. Soak 
it over night in warm water. Scrape it clean, wipe it 
dry. Make a stiff dough of water and flour, roll it out 
one-fourth of an inch thick, the size of ham and lay it 
on the ham with the rind up. Put it in deep pan on 
muffin rings to keep it out of drippings. A good sized 
ham will take from five to seven hours. When it is 
tender take off the crust and peel off the skin, cut off 
all the discolored places, glaze it all over with the 



^:'<- 



The Queen Cook Book 75 

yolks of two well beaten eggs, and sprinkle fine rolled 
cracker on, and put it in oven again to brown. 

Another Way. 

Prepare it as for boiled ham, and boil till nearly 
tender, three or four hours, according to size, remove 
the skin, put it in on the rings in pan, rub over it the 
juice of two large lemons, then cover with brown 
sugar, place in oven until nicely browned. Cover 
with a large tin pan, press with a heavy weight over 
night. Some like grape or currant jell well rubbed 
into the ham while hot, instead of lemon or egg. 

Virginia-Cured Hams. 

From the American Agriculturist 

In Virginia we pride ourselves on our knack of cur- 
ing hams, and the fact that Virginia-cured hams are 
greatly prized and sought after by outsiders proves 
that our pretentions are not altogether groundless. 
There is, in fact, a delicacy of flavor in a ham cured 
after the old Virginia method that is not found in ba- 
con raised and cured elsewhere. This is partly due to 
the feeding of the hog. The hogs of Western pork- 
raisers are fed with a view to producing a great mass 
of flesh, for every pound adds to the profit of the pork 
dealer; but in Virginia, where we are merely raising 
for our own households, we aim for quality rather than 
quantity. We do not aim to have enormously large, 
fat hogs, knowing that they will not be delicately fla- 
vored, but are satisfied to have them weigh about one 
hundred and fifty pounds. We let them run out in 
the pastures and graze, or range the woods and live on 
mast until about six weeks before killing time, when 
we put them up and fatten them on com. 



76 The Queen Cook Book 

After the hogs have been killed and cut iip, we cure 
the hams as follows: First, rub a teaspoonful of pul- 
verized saltpeter on each ham, to give it a red color, 
then rub it thoroughly with salt, and lastly with a mix- 
ture of molasses, brown sugar, and black pepper. 
The same flavoring may also be applied to jowls if 
desired. Pack the hams away, with the skin side 
down, leaving them in the bulk from four to six weeks, 
according to the weather, as it takes the saltpeter a 
longer time to strike in when the weather is cold. In 
old times when they were unpacked the hams were 
always put in the smokehouse and smoked about six 
weeks by a slow, smoldering fire made of green hickory 
chips. About April first, the smoking was completed, 
and then there were two ways of proceeding; either 
to leave the meat hanging or to pack it away again in 
hickory ashes carefully saved during the process of 
smoking. The latter plan was doubtless the best and 
safest. When it was pursued there never was any 
complaint of skippers or other vermin in the meat. 
This was the method pursued by the Massie family, in 
Virginia, whose hams commanded an extra price from 
their superior excellence. The early spring is the time 
these insects first appear, and as the smoking goes on 
then, it serves to keep them at bay. But of late years 
Virginians have almost given up smoking their meat. 
We kill hogs on so much smaller a scale than in 
slavery times that we can keep the meat in our store- 
rooms without the need of a smokehouse. Some 
hoiisekeepers congratulate themselves on having cut 
loose from' the old, troublesome method of curing 
meat, and they say it is just as well flavored without 
smoking. Possibly it may be; but I have noticed that 
skippers and other insects have increased enormously 
since we discontinued smoking our meat, and many a 



The Queen Cook Booh JJ 

ham that ought to have furnished the family with 
choice cuts finds its way into the soap fat. I am, 
therefore, convinced that the old plan is the best and 
safest. If, however, this is inconvenient, try to pro- 
tect the meat from insects by means of bags. As soon 
as they have dried out, after being unpacked from the 
bulk, rub them thoroughly with black pepper, and put 
them in sacks of stout cotton, tied above the hock. 
Do this by the middle, or at latest by the last, of Feb- 
ruary, as any delay might occasion the loss or serious 
damage of the meat. 

The mode of boiling a ham has a great effect on its 
flavor. A ham should be soaked twelve hours before 
it is cooked. Then it should be scraped and sunned 
the previous day, unless it is very fresh. It should be 
put on in cold water, and cooked slowly and gradually. 
Then leave it in the pot until it is cold, as it will thus 
re-absorb a considerable portion of the juices it has 
given out in boiling. Then skin it, and brown it 
slightly in the oven, sprinkling it first with grated 
crackers and a little black pepper. Serve it in a dish 
garnished with parsley, and you will find it " a dainty 
dish to set before a king. 

Ham Forcemeat. 

I pint cold cooked ham % teaspoon salt 
chopped fine ^ teaspoon cayenne pep- 

I pint new milk per 

yi pint dried bread crumbs i teaspoon, even, mustard 
or cracker ^ Yolks of three eggs 

2 tablespoons chopped parsley 
Put the bread in the milk on to boil, stir until it 

thickens, take from the fire, stir in the eggs, add the 

other ingredients, set away to cool. This may be 



78 The Queen Cook Book 

sliced off cold or used as stuffing for game or meats, 
or madejnto croquet shape, dipped in egg and bread 
crumbs, fried or browned in hot fat. 

Chicken Forcemeat. 

This is made the same way, only using a four pound 
chicken instead of ham. 

Pickle for Curing Hams. 

To six gallons of water add nine pounds of salt, 
half coarse, half fine, three ounces of saltpeter, three 
pounds of brown sugar, one pint of molasses, one 
heaping tablespoon saleratus. Boil all together and 
skim; let it stand till cold, then pour over the hams, 
which have been rubbed with a little fine salt and 
pack in a barrel. Let them lie in the brine five or six 
weeks, after which drain and smoke for three days. 
You must make enough to cover the hams. Put a 
weight on top. The same preparation is used for 
pickling beef. A pork barrel will answer for pickling 
beef, but after being once used for beef must never 
again be used for pork. Many losses occur from ig- 
norance of this fact. 

Pig's Head Cheese. 

Split open a pig's head, singe off the hair; cut off 
the whole mouth, nostrils, ears and dig out the eyes, 
brain and everything but the meat. Wash it clean, 
soak it over night in warm water with two even tea- 
spoons of soda in it. Next morning scrape the skin 
well and wash in two waters. Rub it well with salt 
and put over to boil with water enough to cover it. 
Skim it as often as it rises. When cooked so the fiesh

leaves the bones take it up with the help of a skim- 
mer. Then take out all the bones; be careful to get 
all the small ones. Chop it fine. Season to taste 
with salt, pepper and dried sifted sage; stir it in. Lay 
a thin cloth over a colander, put in the meat, fold the 
cloth tightly over it, cover with a plate the right size 
and lay a heavy weight on it over night to press. 
Some add the pig's feet with it dressed as for souse. 
It makes a nice dish sliced ofif for tea. Can put vine- 
gar on it as you eat it. A good change for breakfast 
with soft-boiled eggs and milk toast. A good winter 
dish. 

Pigs' Feet Souse. 

Take the legs and feet of two pigs about eight 
mches long from the toes up, cut them in two about 
four inches long each, cut off the entire foot, singe off 
the hairs, soak them over night in warm water, putting 
in two even teaspoons of soda as a cleanser. In the 
morning scrape them well, dipping them in hot lye, 
then wash them in two more waters. They must be 
scraped and soaked till they look white. Then put 
over to boil for one-half hour, throw off that water 
and put on another with salt. Skim often; let boil 
till the bones will easily pull out, but do not pull 
them out, but put them in a jar with half vinegar 
and half the liquor they were boiled in. To prepare 
for table for any meal you wish, though best for sup- 
per, season, add more vinegar and boil for five minutes. 
Serve hot. 



FISH. 



Fish is not considered so nutritious as meat, but we 
can eat more of it, as it is more easily digested. 
There is not much doubt but that it would be better 



80 The Queen Cook Book 

> 
for us, if we ate more fish than we do. It is very 

healthy and by some considered brain food. I notice 

in most recipes for cooking fish, that lemon, onian 

and vinegar are recommended. Use them if you like, 

but we prefer the delicate flavor of the fish. Lemon 

or vinegar may be a relish on frogs or shrimps. 

Baked Fish. 

The fish should always be very carefully and thor- 
oughly cleaned, scraped outside and washed well. All 
fish should be thoroughly cooked. Wipe it with a dry 
cloth, rub in the salt, on both sides, and fill with tur- 
key dressing; sew it up carefully, do not pack it, as it 
will swell. If you leave the head on clean it well. I 
take it off. Lay it on the rack of roasting pan after 
rubbing it with softened butter, put in pan a little 
water and baste three times. It will take an hour or 
more according to size. It is served with drawn but- 
ter, Hollandaise, or oyster sauce. When fish is well 
cooked it will cleave from the bones easily. 

Steamed Fish or Boiled 

Fish to make turbot is better steamed than boiled. 
Dress it nicely, rub with salt, and wrap it in a sheer 
cloth, that you may take it out without breaking. It 
can be steamed and stuffed with turkey dressing for 
dinner and served with drawn butter. To boil fresh 
fish of any. kind, clean the fish, wipe dry, rub with 
salt both sides, roll firmly in a thin white cloth, wind 
a cord around the fish in several places, put in a large 
kettle of hot water salted. If the fish weighs ten 
pounds allow one and a half hours or less in propor- 
tion. When done take out and drain, take of! the 
cord and cloth, peel the skin off, taste to see if it is 



The Queen Cook Book 8 1 

salt enough. Serve with Hollandaise sauce or drawn 
butter. 

Fried Fish. 

Fish to be fried, after being well cleaned, wipe 
with a dry cloth, rub with salt, dredge lightly with 
flour, place in hot spider with drippings and butter. 
Turn carefully without breaking, when brown. Brown 
both sides, but do not burn. Cut the pieces three 
inches wide for frying. All fish should be freshly 
caught. 

Creamed Fish. 

A nice breakfast dish. The day before you wish 
to use it, prepare a fish the size you need, rub salt on 
it, wrap in cheese cloth, either steam or boil it slowly 
for thirty minutes; skin it and take out the bones 
while hot, and when cool take a silver fork and pick it 
into flakes. Be careful not to muss it. In the morn- 
ing put over the fire one pint of milk, braid together 
two tablespoons of butter and one of flour until smooth; 
when milk is hot stir in some of it gradually on 
the paste until it is boiled enough to cook the flour, 
pour- on the fish; a sprinkle of pepper and salt. 

TURBOT A LA CrEME. 

Steam until tender one white fish, first rubbing it 
with salt, after nicely cleaning. Then take off the 
skin, pick out all the bones; pick the fish up. For 
dressing: One pint of milk, boiled; braid together 
two teaspoons of flour, four tablespoons of butter and 
stir in milk with white pepper and salt as you like. Cook 
five minutes, stirring all the time. When cool add two 
well beaten eggs. Put in the baking dish a layer of fish 



82 The Queen Cook Book 

then a layer of dressing, and so on, till the dish is full; 
a sprinkle of rolled cracker crumbs on top and sprinkle 
this with milk enough to moisten them. Bake one- 
half hour in moderate oven, browning the top. Serve 
in same dish, which should be a pudding dish. A nice 
supper dish, with hot biscuit and Saratoga potatoes. 
The dressing must always be only as thick as cream. 

Fish Souffle to Bake in Shells. 

Prepared the same as for turbot, only you mix 
fish and dressing (after cooking) with one small cup of 
fine rolled cracker, with a fork. Fill the shells or 
cups (butter them first) with the fish; sprinkle top 
with cracker, dampen with sprinkle of milk. Set them 
in dripping pan of hot water, bake twenty minutes, 
brown the top. Serve hot for lunches. 

! 

Creamed Salmon. 

Drain the liquor from a can of salmon and chop 
fine. Then proceed the same way as for other fresh 
fish to make a turbot or souffle. If you use fresh sal- 
mon you must boil it first. Season. 

Canned Salmon. 

Canned salmon is cooked before canning. If you pre- 
fer it heated, set the can in steamer, or boiling water. 
Open, drain off all the liquid, then remove to a platter, 
taking out any skin or poor pieces. Garnish with 
parsley. 

Potted Shad or any Fresh Fish. 

Make use of it the day it is caught if possible. For 
five pounds of fish rub in two even tablespoons of 



The Queen Cook Booh 83 

salt. Cut the fish in pieces about an inch wide and 
four inches long. Make a mixture of spices, of one 
even teaspoon of white pepper, two teaspoons each of 
cinnamon, cloves and allspice, mix thoroughly. Put 
a layer of fish in a stone jar and sprinkle each layer 
with the mixed spice, sprinkle flour and bits of butter 
on each layer, repeating till done. Fill jar with equal 
parts of vinegar and water. Tie on top a stiff writing 
paper and lay on top of that a stiff dough of flour and 
water. Bake from four to six hours. When cold 
slice. 

A Supper Dish. 

Select a three-pound fish, dress, salt and wrap in a 
thin cloth and boil or put in steamer, salt the water, 
cook thirty minutes. While this is boiling (if you wish 
it), boil four eggs hard, say eight minutes, drop them 
into cold water for one minute, so the yolk outside 
will not turn green. When cold separate the yolk 
and whites and chop each separately. Remove the 
fish to the center of a large platter. Place about four 
inches of the yolks and then four inches of the 
chopped whites alternately till you have encircled the 
fish. Wash and chop fine parsley enough to sprinkle 
over the whole. Cut lemons in two lengthwise, then 
cut each half in four pieces and lay around the fish, 
serving it with it, either hot or cold. Serve with 
creamed potatoes and spiced pickles. 

Broiled Fish. 

When fish are to be broiled they should be split 
down the back, leaving head and tail on. Wash and 
wipe dry, salt, grease the whole broiler with suet; 
place the fish flesh side dowD> which should always be 
cooked first and longer, on medium hot coals* When 



$4 The Queen Cook Book 

half cookea turn platter on, then turn platter and 
broi)<!ir over together, unless you have a double wire 
broiler; the skin side needs careful attention, as it 
burns easily. When done loosen carefully, so as not 
to breuk it, and slide onto platter inside up. Serve 
with pepper and butter. 

Salt Boiled Mackerel. 

Soak in tepid water twelve hours, changing the 
water once or twice according to saltness. Clean, 
wipe dry with a cloth. Wrap the fish in a cloth and 
boil slowly fifteen minutes. Drain from the water, 
pepper and butter it, set in oven three minutes, serve 
with bslked potatoes. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel. 

Is prepared in the same way, only broiled instead of 
boiling. 

Halibut Steak. 

Take a piece halibut an inch or more thick, rub in 
salt, butter the bottom of dripping pan, pepper it. 
Sprinkle with one tablespoon of lemon juice, cut in 
bits Q^n't tablespoon of butter and put on it; bake 
thirty minutes. Serve this with Hollandaise sauce 
which may be prepared, all but cooking, several hours 

before needed. i 

i 

I 
Hollandaise Sauce. 

Measure one-half cup butter and cream it, add the 
yolks of two raw unbeaten eggs. When nearly ready i 

to serve, add the juice of one lemon, one-half of a 
cupful of boiling water slowly beating until it thickens 
like soft custard, cooking in double boiler,

Creamed Cod Fish. 

For four persons, pick up a bowl full of cod fish 
fine, picking out all the bones. Freshening by 
squeezing it with hand in a quart of cold water from 
three to five minutes, leaving salt enough in it to salt 
the cream or milk it is cooked in. Put it in a pint of 
milk or half cream, squeeze all the water out. If you 
use milk one tablespoon of good butter, if cream, no 
butter. Thicken with a tablespoon of flour, one 
beaten egg, and boil four minutes, just enough to cook 
the flour, do not boil the fish any more as it makes it 
hard; you can put it on as many half slices of bread as 
persons to eat. Sprinkle the top with white pepper, 
slice hard boiled eggs, as many as there are persons, 
laying them on top. For a weak stomach cook it in 
water, let them sip the thin broth. The beauty of 
this depends upon not freshening too much or not 
enough, this requires some experience. Soaking or 
scalding cod fish to freshen it takes all the cod fish 
flavor out of it, and no amount^of seasoning can put it 
back. 

Cod Fish Balls. 

Freshen the fish the same as for creamed fish, 
squeeze dry, to one cup of cod fish put two cups of 
seasoned mashed potatoes, two beaten eggs, mix well 
with a fork, with cream enough to moisten and a little 
butter. Make into balls one-half inch thick, nearly 
three inches across, allowing two for a person. Dip 
in beaten %^% and then in flour. Brown m butter and 
drippings. These are very nice. Do not cook too 
fast. In cool weather you can prepare enough for 
two meals. They are good for supper or break* 
fast, with boiled eggs or poached eggs on toast. 



86 The Queen Cook Book 



Boiled Cod Fish. 

Boil a piece of cod fish according to size of family, 
boil thirty minutes slowly. Serve with mashed pota- 
toes and drawn butter for dinner. 

Fried Frogs. 

The hind legs are the only parts that are used. In the 
markets you buy them ready skinned. Wash them 
in strong salt water, then pour on boiling hot water, 
let stand on them five minutes, then rub them with 
lemon juice after wiping them dry, then rub with 
salt, boil three minutes, wipe dry, dip in beaten egg 
and then in flour or fine rolled cracker, then fry in hot 
spider with fialf butter and half drippings and brown 
them. Can prepare them in same way and broil 
them; dress as broiled chicken. 

Lobsters. 

Lobsters when freshly caught, have some muscular 
action in their claws which may be excited by pressing 
the eyes. The heaviest lobsters for their size are the 
best. A four-pound one is good size. The male is 
thought to have the highest flavor, the flesh is firmer 
and the shell has a brighter red, and is considered 
best during fall and spring. It may be readily distin- 
guished from the female, as the tail is narrower and 
the two uppermost fins within the tail are stiff and 
hard; those of the female are soft and the tail broader. 

Never buy a dead lobster. They should be perfectly 
fresh and very lively. The male lobster is preferred 
for eating and the female for making sauces and 



The Queen Cook Book 8/ 

soups. The female has a broader tail and fewer claws 
than the male. If possible always boil the lobster at 
home, but in some localities where it is a necessity to 
buy them boiled, see that the tail is stiff and elastic, 
so that when you bend it out, it springs back immedi- 
ately, otherwise they were dead before boiling. Lob- 
sters boiled when dead are watery and soft; they are 
poisonous. 

To Boil and Open a Lobster. 

Fill a kettle with warm water (not boiling); put in 
the lobster, head downward; add a tablespoon of salt; 
cover the kettle and stand it over a very quick fire. 
They suffer less by being put into warm than in boiling 
water. In the latter they are killed by heat; in warm 
water they are smothered. A medium-sized lobster 
should boil half an hour; a larger one three-quarters. 
Cooking them too long makes them tough, and the 
meat will stick to the shell. When done and cool 
separate the tail from the body and twist off all the 
claws; shake out carefully the tom-allez (this is the 
liver of the lobster and may be known by its greenish 
color), also the coral. Then draw the body from the 
shell, remove the stomach (sometimes called the lady), 
which is found immediately under the head, and throw 
this away. Now split the body through the center 
and pick the meat from the cells; cut the under side 
of the tail shell, loosen the meat and take it out in one 
solid piece. Now split the meat of the tail, open and 
you will discover a little vein running its entire length 
— this remove. The vein is not always the same color; 
sometimes it is red, sometimes black and sometimes 
white; but in all cases it must be carefully taken out 
and thrown away. The stomach or lady, the vein, 



88 The Queen Cook Book 

and the spongy fingers between the body and the shell, 
are the only parts not eatable. Crack the claws and 
take out the meat. To serve plain boiled lobster, 
arrange the meat thus: taken out in the center of a cold 
dish, garnishing with the claws, sprigs of fresh parsley, 
hard boiled eggs cut into quarters and pickled beets 
cut into fancy shapes. Let each person season to suit 
one's self. 

Lobster Turbot 

Is made the same as fish turbot, or scalloped, as some 
call it. 

Sturgeon. 

Sturgeon fish are only good fried or baked. For 
frying, boil it slowly for fifteen minutes to take out the 
strong taste. If it is not already skinned, skin it, and 
cut in two-inch pieces and fry as other fish, only 
longer, till well done. It is a large fish and used to 
be called Albany beef. It is indeed as large as a large 
calf, being from four to six feet long. In a large fam- 
ily one can use a piece large enough to stuff or fill with 
turkey dressing, and bake, sew it up, putting slices of 
ham on it and under. Parboil it first. 

To Pickle Salmon. 

1 2 pounds salmon i red pepper 

3 quarts vinegar 1 5 pepper corns 

1 pint boiling water 3 bay leaves 

2 onions sliced 3 tablespoons whole mus- 
20 cloves tard 

3 sticks mace 3 tablespoons brown sugar 
Clean nicely, rub it well with salt, using a table- 

spoopful, cover with boiling water, and boil fifteen 



The Queen Cook Book 89 

minutes to every pound. When done, drain off the 
water, roll the fish tight in dry cloth, to dry it, then 
skin it and cut it up. Tie all the spices in thin mus- 
lin and boil in the vinegar and water fifteen minutes 
till you get the strength out. Then put in the salmon 
and boil five minutes. Have your air tight glass jars 
in boiling water, empty and set in the hot water as 
you fill them with the salmon full, then fill up all the 
places well between with the boiling liquor; screw 
tight and keep in a dark, cool, dry place. You can 
pickle halibut and sturgeon in the same way. 

Eels, Stewed or Fried. 

They should not be eaten in the hot months, and be 
eaten the day they are caught. Skin and clean the 
eels, cut off their heads and take out all that is 
stringy, cut into pieces about three inches long; par- 
boil them about ten minutes, drain off that water, 
then put on one pint of veal soup stock, season with 
salt, butter and pepper, boil slowly about twenty-five 
minutes, then thicken with flour and pour over them. 
Use parsley or onion if you like. Fry eels the same 
as fish, after parboiling. 

Fried Smelts. 

Cut off the fins, wipe dry, beat two eggs and put a 
melted teaspoon of butter in the eggs, dip the smelts 
in the egg, then in the rolled cracker and fry like fish 
in half butter and half lard, till they are a rich brown. 

Stewed Oysters. 

50 oysters J4 cup rolled cracker 

y2 pint cream J4 half cup hot water 

J4 pint milk Salt and pepper to taste 

2 tablespoons butter 
Empty the can of oysters and broth in dish, pour 



go The Queen Cook Book 

on the one-half cup of hot water, take the hand (after 
washing) and stir to rinse off the broth, and take out 
the oysters with the hand (feeling for any bits of shell); 
drain well; put this broth in stew kettle; let come to a 
simmer; skim every particle of scum, then add the 
cream and milk; let come to a boil. After putting 
butter, salt and pepper on top of the oysters, set 
kettle where it will not boil, pour the oysters in and 
let stand, stirring a little, say eight minutes. As soon 
as they begin to shrink take them off and pour onto the 
rolled cracker in hot tureen, strirring so it will not be 
lumpy. Serve immediately. If the oysters boil up 
even once they become hardened. The pure flavor of 
an oyster is better than anything you can flavor it 
with. It needs nothing. 

Oysters on Toast. 

This may be quickly prepared after everything and 
all the family are ready for tea. Have coals ready for 
the toast. Toast as many slices of bread as there are 
members of family. Take as many oysters as you 
need and scald the pure broth and skim, add butter, 
pepper, salt, a little cream, and flour enough to make 
it as thick as cream, and boil a minute to cook the 
flour, then put in the oysters and let them get boiling 
hot through without boiling. A half-warmed oyster is 
not acceptable. Lay buttered toast on platter and 
pour on oysters and broth. If more broth put it 
in gravy tureen. Be careful not to have too much 
broth on toast, or it will be soaked. The toast must 
be toasted brown, not white nor black. I prepare 
this myself while the maid toasts the bread, then it is 
all served hot and seasoned desirable. 



The Queen Cook Book 9 1 



Fried Oysters. 

Take the largest oysters, pour on a half cup of hot 
water and stir to take off the liquor; drain well; lay on 
dry cloth, then pepper and salt them and dip in beaten 
egg, then in fine rolled cracker and fry on grid lie or 
spider. Serve hot. 

Fried Oysters. 

Another way is to prepare them in same way and 
fry them in boiling hot fat — ^half suet and half lard. 
They will cook a golden brown in three minutes. 

Oyster Fritters. 

Select the largest oysters, drain well, lay on dry 
cloth, salt and pepper them; take the liquor, boil and 
skim, add salt, one cup of milk, three beaten eggs, 
sift with six tablespoons of flour, one teaspoon of 
baking powder, beat all well together. Have a spider 
of hot fat as for fried cakes — half suet and half lard. 
Put oysters in batter and drop one by one in the boil- 
ing hot fat. First drop a small bit of bread in to 
test the heat; if it browns quickly it is hot enough. 
Turn them when half done. Cook them a golden 
brown. It will take about four minutes. Serve hot. 

Baked Oysters. 

Take large, fresh oysters; scrub the shells till per- 
fectly clean, then place in baking pan in a quick oven, 
and bake till they open themselves. Take off the top 
shell, leaving the oyster in lower shell. Season with 
a little butter, salt and pepper. Only those who live 
near oyster beds can enjoy these in their freshness. 






92 The Queen Cook Book 



Broiled Oysters. 

Wipe your oysters (select large ones) in a dry nap- 
kin. Season with salt and pepper; dip in raw beaten egg 
and then in fine rolled cracker or fine bread crumbs. 
Take a fine new wire, double in form of a hairpin, say 
two of them. String the oysters on them and lay on 
fine gridiron, or fasten the wires on a long stick or 
cane, and hold them in front of a hot fire. Grease 
the gridiron with salt pork or butter. Bread crumbs 
are prepared by drying sUces in the oven and then 
grating. Serve oysters on hot dishes and hot plates 
always. 

Oyster Patties. 

Prepare a puff paste (see index), roll thin, cut out 
with a cutter three or more inches in diameter. Leave 
the bottom layer whole, cut out the center of two 
other layers, leaving the rings one-half the width of 
circle, place the two rings on the whole one. Make as 
many as you need and bake on tins just a little golden 
tinge, as they will brown a little more when filled. 
You can make these the day before you use them, in 
winter two or three days, and fill them thirty minutes 
before eating. If you live in a city you can purchase 
these of a caterer and fill them yourself. Prepare the 
oysters the same as stewed oysters, only make less 
broth. Fill the patties with the oysters, say three or 
four, a little of the dressing; bake till boiling hot through. 
Serve hot with rolls for one course. Or you can line 
plain pattie pans with nice pie crust (or puff paste), 
filling with the same and cover with a top crust. 
Bake the same way. The first are delicious. Will 
bake in twenty-five minutes. 



The Queen Cook Book 93 



Scalloped Oysters. 

For two quarts of oysters have two cups of fine 
rolled cracker. Boil and skim the broth. Sprinkle 
the bottom of dish with cracker then a thick layer of 
oysters. Season with salt, pepper, and bits of butter, 
then sprinkle cracker not one-fourth of an inch thick; 
then sprinkle with the scalded broth enough to moisten 
the cracker, remembering the oysters will moisten 
some when heated; then another layer of oysters, and 
so on, till the dish is full — having the crackers on top, 
and sprinkle the top with one-third of a cup of milk. 
It will take one cup of the broth and two heaping 
tablespoons of butter. 

Raw Oysters. 

There are now regular oyster plates to serve six 
oysters on, but if you have none, you can get six oys- 
ters to each person in shells; wash and wipe nicely, 
open them, leaving the oysters on the under shell. 
Put six on a plate with one-fourth of a lemon in the 
center, or you can put them on a tea-plate. Each 
one will season for himself. 

Drawn Butter. 

One pint of milk boiled, braid together two table- 
spoons of flour, four of butter and stir in milk; season 
with white pepper and salt; boil five minutes, stirring 
all the time, when cool add two well beaten eggs. 
This is really the foundation for all fish and chicken 
sauces, or lobster, by adding onion juice or lemon, 
celery juice, vinegar, mushrooms or capers, you have 
all kind of sauces. 



94 714^ Queen Cook Book 



HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. 

Measure one-half cup of butter and cream, add the 
yolks of two raw unbeaten eggs* When nearly ready 
to serve, add one-half cup of boiling water, the juice 
of one lemon, slowly beating till it thickens like soft 
custard cooking in double boiler. 

Mayonnaise Sauce. 

Yolks of 3 raw eggs i tablespoon sugar 

I teaspoon mustard i pint olive oil 

% cup vinegar i cup whipped cream 

A pinch of cayenne i teaspoon salt 

Juice of half a lemon 
Beat the yolks and dry ingredients until they are 
very light and thick (I always find better success to 
beat eggs with a knife on a flat plate) set the eggs 
where they will be cold before breaking; add a few 
drops of oil at a time until the dressing becomes very 
thick and rather hard, when the oil can be added more 
rapidly; when it gets so that it stirs hard, add a little 
vinegar; when the last of the oil and vinegar has been 
added it should be very thick; now add the lemon 
juice and whipped cream, and place on ice for a few 
hours, or in a cold place. The cream may be omitted 
without injury. To set this on ice during the beating 
is better. 

Boiled Salad Dressing. 

3 raw eggs 3 tablespoon sugar. 

I tablespoon olive oil i teaspoon mustard 

or butter i cup milk 

I cup vinegar i even teaspoon salt 

Stir oil, salt, mustard and sugar in a dish until per- 
fectly smooth; add the well beaten eggs and beat to-

gether, then the vinegar and finally the milk. Place 
in double boiler and stir from eight to ten minutes, 
keeping the water boiling, till it thickens like cream. 

Mayonnaise Dressing No. i. 

I give this recipe to show how much a Mayonnaise 
depends upon the right mixing^ 

2 yolks raw eggs J^ pint good olive oil or 

J^ teaspoon of mustard butter 

I teaspoon of lemon A pinch of cayenne 
juice or vinegar J^ teaspoon salt 

Place the oil and eggs on ice if you have it, if not, 
in the coldest place, for an hour. Beat your eggs well 
with a knife, then stir in salt, pepper, and mustard; 
work these well together, and then add drop by drop 
the oil. Stir rapidly and steadily while adding the oil, 
always stirring the same way. After adding one-half 
the oil (or butter) alternate occasionally with a few 
drops of lemon juice or vinegar. The more oil you 
use the thicker the dressing. If it becomes too thick, 
add a Httle more vinegar. More or less oil may be 
added according to the quantity of dressing desired. 
With care a quart bottle of oil may be stirred into the 
yolks of two eggs alternating with the vinegar, after 
adding the first gill of oil. In case the dressing should 
curdle, that is, the oil and egg separate, which makes 
the dressing oily and liquid, take at once two new 
eggs on another plate, after beating well, add by tea- 
spoonfuls the curdled mayonnaise, stirring rapidly and 
steadily as before, and then finish by adding more oil 
as directed. This dressing if covered tightly in a glass 
jar, will keep in a cold place three or four days. You 
can add whipped cream as you use it, or more vine- 
gar. 



96 The Queen Cook Book 

Salad Dressing Without Oil No. i. 

1 half pint milk i tablespoon butter 
Yolks 3 eggs i teaspoon salt 

2 even tablespoons corn 2 tablespoon vinegar 
starch i salt spoon white pepper 
Put the milk on to boil, moisten the corn starch 

with cold milk and stir it in boiling milk till it thick- 
ens and is cooked with the salt. Then add the 
beaten yolks, pepper, butter and vinegar. Cook one 
minute and let cool. 

Cream Salad Dressing. 

Yolks of three hard boiled 2 tablespoons vinegar 

eggs 5^ pint thick cream 

1 tablespoon softened Yolk of i raw egg 
butter % teaspoon white pepper 

^ teaspoon salt 
Mash the hard boiled eggs or yolks until fine, then 
add the raw yolks and work to a perfectly smooth 
paste; then add the melted butter, then by degrees 
the cream, working and stirring all the while, now 
add the vinegar, mix well, and it is finished. Keep cold. 

Lobster Salad No. i. 

2 lobsters 2 heads lettuce 

J^ pint mayonnaise 
Prepare, cook and dress two lobsters (weighing 
four or five pounds) as directed (see lobster). Cut the 
meat into dice size with a silver knife, put it in a cold 
place till wanted. Make the mayonnaise. Clean the 
two tail shells and one back in cold water, and with 
scissors remove the thin shell from the under side of 
tail. Wash and dry the lettuce leaves; put them 



The Queen Cook Book 97 

around the salad dish in two or three layers. Join the 
shells together in the form oL a boat, the body shell 
in the center; put them in the salad dish. Mix the 
mayonnaise and lobster lightly together, place it in 
this boat. If there is any coral wash it fine and 
sprinkle it over the top. Garnish with a chain of the 
whites of hard boiled eggs cut into slices and lapped or 
linked together. 

Lobster Salad No. 2. 

Cut up and season the lobster the same as chicken; 
break the leaves from a head of lettuce, wash them 
well and singly; put^ them in a pan of ice water for 
about ten minutes, then shake the water off; place in 
ice chest till time of serving; when ready to serve put 
two or three leaves together in the form of a shell, and 
arrange these shells on a flat dish; mix half of the 
mayonnaise dressing with the lobster; put a teaspoonful 
of this in each shell of leaves; finish with a teaspoon 
of dressing on top; this is an inviting dish. 

A Plain Dressing. 

2 cups vinegar i even teaspoon salt 

3 raw eggs Ji cup cream or milk 

J^ teaspoon dry mustard A sprinkle of white pepper 

Ji cup butter 
Stir into your milk the well beaten eggs, add the 
seasoning, stir in the softened butter, beating thor- 
oughly. Then in this pour the vinegar boiling hot 
(do not heat it in tin), but cook it all in a double gran- 
ite boiler, stirring continually and briskly so it will not 
curdle. Return all to the granite pan, put over the fire 
and keep stirring till it boils lively for one minute, then 
remove to a cool place, then place on ice to stiffen; put

all these ingredients gradually together; add sugar if 
you like. Plain lettuce and pealed sliced tomatoes 
with a liberal covering of mayonnaise sauce, is liked by 
many, or simply with sugar and vinegar on. 

Crab Salad, Fish or Shrimps. 

This is made by simply boiling i dozen crabs thirty 
minutes, when cold pick out the meat and when ready 
to serve mix the crabs with the mayonnaise the same 
as lobsters. Fish or shrimps are used in the same way 
after being dressed and cooked. One can double any 
of these recipes, or make only half of it as they need, 
or use butter in place of olive oil. It is very uncertain 
whether you can obtain pure oil in small towns or not, 
as there is such a small demand it does not pay the 
grocerymen to keep it. Some do not think it as relish- 
able as butter nor as digestible. The experience of one 
lady was, when she had a table of ten guests, she had 
mayonnaise dressing on the chicken salad made with 
pure olive oil. There were but three dishes that were 
much more than tasted of. Another time she had 
a company of about twenty-five; the mayonnaise was 
made of swe^t butter for chicken salad, and the salad 
dishes were empty. Both companies were well ac- 
quainted with salads. 

Mayonnaise Dressing No. 2. (In bottle) 

Yolks of 4 raw eggs 2 even teaspoons salt 

I quart bottle salad oil 2 even teaspoons mustard 

8 tablespoons vinegar i quart cream 

These ingredients are mixed the same way as may- 
onnaise No. i. Mixing the eggs and oil or butter first, 
then add the seasoning. Then add by degrees the 
quart of cream and bottle air tight for use. If well

made, this will keep for six months.^ If one has occa- 
sion to use this frequently, it is well to have it on 
hand. 

Sauce Tartare.

J^ salt spoon pepper }4 cup butter 

Yolks 2 raw eggs i tablespoon chopped pars- 

6 tablespoons vinegar ley

Salad Dressing without Oil No. 2.

I even teaspoon mustard i even salt spoon red pepper 
Stir all together as directed in mayonnaise except 
the vinegar, beating it all the time, place it in double 
boiler till it boils; then remove and beat in slowly the 
vinegar. This will keep for weeks, corked tight, in 
cool place. 

Fruit Salad. 

6 oranges ^ pineapple 

6 bananas ^ cocoanut 

Cut and slice the oranges (after peeling them) across 
the grain, leaving the core out, peel and slice the ba- 
nanas in rounds in a separate dish. Peel and dig out 
the eyes of the pineapple and then grate it. Take 
the dish that you are to serve it in, and lay in alter- 
nate layers of fruit and sugar, till all are in, then on the 
top pile fresh grated cocoanut. This can be prepared 
two or more hours before you wish to use it.

Chicken Sandwiches. 

Sandwiches of all kinds are made by spreading two 
slices of bread with butter and placing them together 
with meat between them. Bread should be twenty- 
four hours old, must be moist and light; cut quite 
thin slices with a very sharp knife; spread them thinly 
with nice fresh butter, then with your hashed or 
sliced meat. After the chicken is cooked, chop it fine, 
when cold, to almost a paste, then moisten this suf- 
ficiently so it will spread easily, with softened butter, 
a little cream, salt, pepper, and a little mustard if you 
like, but it must be very little. Spread and put two 
slices together but do not press much; when ready to 
serve cut in fancy shapes, diamond, oblong, etc. 
Cover with damp napkin till ready to use. 

Veal Sandwiches. 

Chop the nice, small pieces that are left from a veal 
roast, and moisten with the veal gravy. 

Lamb Sandwiches. 

Are made the same way as veal, moistened with the 
gravy and seasoned to taste. The meats to all, must 
be perfectly smooth and spread evenly. 

Tongue Sandwiches. 

Boil the tongue the day before you wish to use it, 
let it cool in its own liquor, take out, peel. Next day 
slice, chop fine, add enough sweet cream, softened 
butter, and seasoning of salt, pepper, or mustard. 
The tongue should have been in brine three or more 
weeks. A fresh tongue has no relish. It should be a 
beef's tongue. 



The Queen Cook Book idi 



Ham Sandwiches. 

To a coffee cup of lean ham finely chopped, add 
three tablespoons of butter, the yolk of one beaten 
egg, season as needed with salt, pepper and a very 
little mustard. Just let it get boiling hot, then -per- 
fectly cold before spreading your buttered bread. 
Another way is to mix the ham with mayonnaise dress- 
ing to a soft paste, and spread between your buttered 
thin slices of bread. Sardines, tongue, chicken, or 
lobster, may be mixed this way in place of ham. 

Chicken Salad No. 2. 

Boil two chickens tender, salted as for table, take 
out skin and bone and all discoloring. Cut in strips, 
and then in bits the size of large peas; put chicken and 
celery on ice. For dressing; the yolks of four fresh 
eggs, with the yolks of two hard boiled eggs. Rub 
these smoothly. A good measure of butter or oil is a 
tablespoon to each yolk of fresh egg. All the art con- 
sists in introducing the butter or oil and vinegar by 
degrees. It takes time to make a good salad. When 
the oil is well mixed put in two teaspoons of salt, one 
small even teaspoon of white pepper, two tablespoons 
of vinegar. When ready to serve mix celery and chicken 
well, then with a silver fork stir in the dressing, mix- 
ing thoroughly. This salad to be crisp must be made 
the day it is used. The best salad for health is simply 
crisp lettuce with sugar and vinegar on it. These 
mixtures do for a treat.

Cabbage Dressing. 

This is very nice when one can not obtain celery for 
% dressing for a chicken salad, made in the same way 



I02 The Queen Cook Book 

as the chicken salad on page loi, substituting the cab- 
bage for celery, shave it very fine and chop it a little. 

Egg Salad. 

Boil six eggs hard; chop the whites fine, and rub 
the yolks smooth with a silver spoon. Sprinkle in a 
little salt, pepper and chopped celery. Mix in mayon- 
naise dressing, put this on lettuce leaves with a cup of 
chopped chicken or of ham mixed in it, or use it for a 
lettuce salad. 

Cream Dressing. 

Five eggs beaten separately; two teaspoons of mixed 
mustard, butter the size of an egg, two teaspoons of 
salt, one-half teaspoon of red pepper, three tablespoons 
of the finest table oil, one pint of thick cream. Scald the 
cream, stir in the yolks and continue to stir until it be- 
gins to thicken, then add the seasoning and two or 
three teaspoons of vinegar, then cool and add the 
beaten whites. Stir in oil when cold. 



EGGS. 



Eggs are almost invaluable, particularly in the spring 
of the year, when we can obtain them so fresh and 
plentiful. Baron Liebig says: " There is more nutri- 
ment in an egg than in anything of equal bulk that 
exists in nature, or that chemistry can produce." To 
prove whether eggs are good or bad, place a few at a 
time in a deep dish of cold water. The fresher the 
egg the sooner it will fall to the bottom on its side; if 
it falls on the end reject it; if it swims, it is bad thor- 
oughly. To preserve eggs for winter use, after testing 
them, put in the bottom of a one or two gallon wooden 



The Queen Cook Book 103 

tub or keg with a flat cover, so they can stand on 
either end when you turn the vessel once a week, so 
as to keep the yolks from settling. The time to pack 
is the latest fall eggs you can obtain, packing them as 
fast as you can obtain them. You make more sure of 
keeping them if you stop the pores of the shell by 
dipping the eggs in a thin solution of gum Arabic and 
let dry. I knew of one lady that kept them from the 
iirst of November to the second week in April, simply 
packing in salt. It was a very cold winter and kept 
them in the cellar. Keep cool and be sure they are 
all fresh eggs. An egg six weeks old will not hatch. If 
you would like your hens to lay in winter, save all the 
meat bones, dry them, and have them pulverized in 
some way and mix a little in their food; as much as 
you think they would eat of gravel and sand in sum- 
mer. Give them bones dried to peck at. 

Hard boiled eggs should be put directly on taking 
out into a dish of cold water for a minute or so, to pro- 
tect the outside of yolks from turning dark. 

Boiled Eggs. 

Dip the eggs first in cold water to prevent their 
cracking. Then put them in water simmering hot and 
let boil slowly three and a half minutes. This just 
cooks the whites and heats the yolks hot. Another. 
Place the eggs in boiling hot water, move the dish to 
the back of the range, cover closely and let stand ten 
minutes. This causes the white to be of creamy con- 
sistency, and the yolk not hard and dry. For hard 
boiled eggs boil eight minutes — some like them fiftean 
minutes. 



104 ^^^ Queen Cook Book 



Poached Eggs. 

Butter the bottom of dish that you poach them in, 
so they will not stick and break when you take them 
up; put in two inches boiling hot water. The dish or 
spider must be flat-bottomed; lay in muffin rings, 
break one egg at a time in a saucer, put one in each 
ring (no salt, as it hardens the white) ; do not have the 
water boil, but only simmer; with a spoon dip the 
water over each Qgg\ be careful not to break the yolks; 
as soon as the whites look like a thick veil over the 
yolk they are done; they will cook in from three to 
four minutes. Take a half slice of toast, sprinkle 
salted hot water on it with a spoon and butter it as 
for eating, lay one egg on each piece of toast, salt and 
pepper and lay a bit of butter on the center of each 
egg. This can all be done while the family are get- 
ting seated at table, as their relish depends much upon 
their freshness. There are pans made out of heavy 
tin now on purpo3e for poaching eggs, which hold from 
two to six or more eggs, but the bottom cooks harder 
than it does in spider. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

For four persons take five eggs, break them in a 
deep earthen pie-plate, half beat them, then add half 
a cup of cream if you have it, if not, milk and salt, 
stir a little, taste to see if salt enough; before this 
place spider on stove with a piece of butter the size of 
a large hickory nut, to get just sissing hot, pour in the 
eggs and scrape one way with large spoon constantly 
(do not stir round and round) cooking gently and 
evenly; when it is as delicate as a boiled custard, take 
it off quickly and pour into a hot dish. If you do not 



The Queen Cook Book 105 

beat the eggs too much, it will be in stripes of mingled 
white and yellow, but we like them best well beaten. 
Turn them out before you think them quite done, they 
will cook more; a good sprinkling of white pepper on 
top. They will cook in three minutes or less. 

Omelet. 

Three eggs beaten slightly together, two even tea- 
spoons of flour, two-thirds cup of cream, or milk and 
salt, stir till well mixed, place in hot buttered spider, 
when browned turn one-half on the other half with 
two knives. 

Omelet. 

If you prefer, a dry fluffy omelet to a moist flaky 
one, beat the white and yolk of the eggs separate. If 
not, together slightly, add a tablespoon of cream for 
each egg and salt. Have a flat spider hot and well 
buttered, pour in the omelet, brown slightly on the 
bottom having the top soft, roll one-half over the 
other half deftly and serve in hot covered dish. Some 
set it in oven on top of grate to brown instead of doub- 
ling, but it is not so moist. 

Eggs, Point Shirley Style. 

Separate the yolks and whites of three eggs. Beat 
the yolks two minutes; add three tablespoons of cream, 
one-half even teaspoon salt, beat a little more. Melt 
half a tablespoon of butter in a hot spider, pour in the 
yolks, when they thicken slightly pour the whites in 
without beating. Let them be until they look nearly 
like the white of a boiled egg, then gently mix them 
with a silver fork. Serve in hot dish or if you like on 
buttered toast. Chicken or bam omelet is made by 



io6 Th4 Queen Cook Book 

placing either of them hashed and seasoned over the 
omelet before turning it over. 

Bob the Sea Cook's Omelet. 

A real French omelet is a natural dish. It don't 
want all the fixing most cooking folks put on her. 
One would think by reading the books that it was as 
big a thing to do as a suffler. Most books tell you 
to beat up your whites till they stand, but it ain't 
right. A Frenchman don't take no time in making 
an omelet. While the butter is in the pan heating, 
he gets his eggs ready. There ain't no use to separ*- 
ate whites and yellows. Break the eggs in a bowl,' 
stir them so whites and yellows is mixed thoroughly 
and that's all. Two minutes does that Now don't 
you add water, nor milk, nor nothing. You can put 
cream in, but then that don't make the old original 
Johnny omelet, but something else that may be good 
enough but new fangled. If you have any parsley, 
chop that up before you begin, that is, if you want a 
parsley omelet; the parsley, about a teaspoon to six 
^ggs» ought to be as fine as possible ; add a little salt 
and very little white pepper to your eggs and when 
your butter is a sizzing, tilt over the frying pan a very 
little and pour in your eggs. It don't take half a 
minute to cook. If your butter is hot enough a min- 
ute will do it all. Don't go to turn your omelet with 
a fork but sling her. She ought to take a whole turn 
in the air and fall on her other side. But anyhow, if 
you ain't up to that trick, you might help her over 
with a spoon. An overcooked omelet is just a dis- 
grace. It ought to be mellow and a little underdone 
in the middle. Don't you never go to give people as 
knows what an omelet is, something in a flat sheet as 
tough as a canvas and call it an omelet*

Eggs \ la Lavallbtte. 

Pour into. & fiat tin dish cream to the depth of a 
quarter of an inch; bring to a boil, then drop in the 
eggs and cook until the whites are set. Season to 
taste with salt, pepper and butter. Serve in the same 
dish or take carefully x)ut and pour the seasoned cream 
over the eggs. 

Eggs X la Cr£am. 

Boil six eggs eight minutes, drop in cold water a 
minute; remove the shells, cut in halves; slice a bit off 
each end so they will stand on end. Mix a tablespoon 
of butter with a teaspoon of flour; stir it into a pint 
of boiling milk, stirring constantly; season and pour 
over the eggs. 

Egg Gems. 

Two cups of sweet milk, two eggs, one tablespoon 
of butter, one-half teaspoon salt, thfee and one-half 
cups sifted flour, one heaping teaspoon of baking 
powder. Bake in gem pans. 

To Fry Egg Plant. 

Always choose fat, plump ones, they are much bet- 
ter than the long slim ones. Cut in slices not quite a 
half inch and peel them. Rub a little salt on each 
side and pack them in two piles, putting the largest at 
the bottom, in a dish. Place a plate on top, upon 
which put a laundry iron weight. Fill dish with 
water; let stand an hour and then throw off this 
water; rinse and repeat the same process for another 
hour. This is to take out that unhealthy bitter taste. 
Rinse, wipe dry, dip in beaten egg and then in rolled 



lo8 he Queen Cook Book 

cracker or in batter, and fry in spider; brown on both 
sides in half butter and half suet. If you have a 
fresh plant, not wilted by being picked too long or by 
drought, they are very fine. 



VEGETABLES. 

All vegetables in summer should be freshly gathered 
the day they are to be cooked. Peas, beans, and 
asparagus, if laid over for one day lose their own pe- 
culiar sweetness and relish. Soft water is better for 
all vegetables except potatoes, turnips and cabbage, 
these three should be put in just as the water comes 
to a boil. Some one says that a teaspoon of common 
salt put in a gallon of soft water hardens it at once, 
and a half teaspoon of bi-carbonate of soda to a gal- 
lon of hard water renders it soft. Rainwater, if fresh 
and pure; gives a relish to sweet corn and peas that 
hard water does not, and I put the salt in when it is 
first put over. When any vegetables are wilted they 
should soak for an hour or two, in very cold water. 
Peas, beans and lentils are the most nutritious of all 
vegetables (lentils are raised more in the old country), 
and are said to contain as much carbon (that is heat- 
giving) as wheat and nearly twice the quantity of ni- 
trogen (for muscle). 

Plain Boiled Potatoes. 

Never boil potatoes with their skins on. They con- 
tain three-fourths water and nearly one-fourth starch, 
with a small proportion of other elements, thus sup- 
plying what is lacking in lean meat and other ni- 
trogenous food. When the sprouts bes:in to appear in 



^he Queen Cook Book 109 

« 

the spring they must be rubbed off at once, as they 
exhaust the most nourishing part of the potatoes. 
Rub them off three times and they will cease to grow. 
Keep them in cool place. I presume there are more 
potatoes consumed than all other vegetables put 
together (excepting grains). Select potatoes of 
medium size, without blemishes and of a yellowish 
white color. Those that grow on a rich heavy soil 
are- most nutritious. To boil potatoes wash them 
clean, then pare them thin, and lay them in cold 
water till ready to boil, then put in boiling hot water 
just enough to cover them, boil fifteen minutes, then 
add salt. Boil slowly until nearly doiie, then put in 
half a cup of cold water, to render the potatoes more 
mealy. As soon as tender enough to admit a fork 
easily, pour off the water; take the cover off and 
shake the potatoes in a current of cold air, at either 
the door or window, place the kettle on back part of 
the stove, and cover with a clean, coarse towel until 
serving time. The sooner the potatoes are served the 
better. This is for whole potatoes. Or cut them in 
quarters after shaking them and put on a half cup of 
cream, a little butter, salt, and let come to a scald, 
then dish and sprinkle with pepper. You only need 
half as much cream for mashed potatoes; mash and 
stir with a fork a few times. Season as the others, 
and do not pack them in the dish too solid. 

Creamed Potatoes. 

Take cold boiled potatoes, slice one-fourth of an 
inch thick; put in your spider with salt and half cup of 
cream, and boil it fifteen minutes, chopping it a little 
with spoon and stirring; boil slowly or it will burn. If 
one has no cream, take twice as much milk and boil 



i lo The Queen Cook Book 

it slowly with the potatoes; till it creams. It will 
need a little more butter. Dish and sprinkle with 
pepper, serve hot. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Select medium sized potatoes wash and rinse and 
clean and place in very hot oven for forty or more 
minutes; when done crack each one in your hand, 
with a towel over it. If baked crisp they will snap 
and be mealy as this process lets of! the steam. 

Plain Fried Potatoes. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes one-fourth of an inch 
thick, put in spider a bit of butter and lard; salt them, 
lay them in the hot spider brown lightly and slowly on 
both sides. Pepper. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Prepare the potatoes the same as for boiled 
potatoes, as soon as a fork will go through them 
easily, drain off the water, dry them by setting kettle 
on top of stove, put in salt and butter, according to 
quantity, mash with a wire masher, then stir in a 
little cream or milk as you like with a fork. Dish and 
smooth over the top. Some brown the top in oven. 
There is no vegetable so much used as the potato, 
yet how few know how to cook them properly. 
Most people think they certainly know how to boil a 
potato. Some will throw them in cold water just 
when it happens to be convenient, whether it lacks 
one hour or two before meal time, when they should 
be put in just as the water begins to boil and taken 
off as soon as a fork can easily pierce them. A com-

men sized potato will boil in thirty minutes. We should 
not allow our daughters to lose sight of the fact, that 
to be able to boil an Irish potato well, is an accom- 
plishment of more importance to the human race, 
than to know the science of banging the hair, and will 
go farther to beautify the human face. 

Curled Potatoes. 

Take freshly mashed potatoes and press through a 
colander into your table dish. Brown the top in 
oven. Season just right first. 

Scalloped Potatoes. 

Wash and rinse your potatoes, peel them, boil 
nearly done, and slice thin; butter the pudding dish 
or a good basin, put in a layer of potatoes, then a 
seasoning of salt, pepper, and bits of butter, fill with 
potatoes, remembering to season every layer; cover the 
top with cracker crumbs, then heat boiling hot, one 
cup of cream and one cup of milk and sprinkle it 
over till it is half full or over. Cover with a good 
plate that fits, and bake in the oven one hour and a 
quarter for two quarts. Some like chopped parsley 
in, and a thin layer of rolled cracker between each 
layer of potatoes. Take off the plate fifteen minutes 
before they are done, to brown the top. Others 
sprinkle a little flour between each layer; or make a 
■ nice drawn butter of your cream and milk, with one 
tablespoon of flour no thicker than cream and put it 
between each layer of potatoes. For one quart or 
less bake thirty minutes, having the oven just at boil- 
ing point. Take off the plate and brown the top 
when nearly done. These are very nice for supper, 
and if there are some left over, they can be used for 



1 12 The Queen Cook Book 

breakfast, by adding a little cream to moisten them 
and heat hot in the oven. If raw potatoes bake one 
hour or more. 

French .Fried Potatoes. 

Select long potatoes. When peeled and rinsed put 
in cold water for one hour, wipe dry, cut lengthwise 
into six or eight pieces, place on a dry clean cloth and 
clap them dry; have ready a kettle of hot lard, or half 
suet and lard, fill a skimmer with the potatoes and 
drop into the hot fat. The fat must be hot or they 
will not be good, but care must be taken not to have 
your lard spatter over, as you put them in and so set 
fire to the spider; when ready to put the potatoes in, 
set the spider on the back part of the stove for a min- 
ute or two to avoid this. They generally cook in ten 
minutes; try with a fork, skim out. and lay on drab 
paper and sorinkle salt on both sides, and serve hot. 

Parisienne Potatoes. 

Peel large potatoes and throw into cold water for 
half an hour, dry with a cloth, and with a vegetable 
scoop cut out tiny balls, dry with a cloth again and 
cook in hot suet cooked through and of a light 
brown; the fat must be very hot, then they will be dry 
and mealy. Skim out on clean drab paper and 
sprinkle with salt. 

Potatoes a la Royal. 

* Allow one pint of hot boiled potatoes, half cup of 
cream, two tablespoons of butter, the whites of four 
eggs and yolk of one and salt; mash the potatoes fine, 
then beat light with a fork. Gradually add the butter 
and cream, and beaten egg to a froth, mix well, turn 



The Queen Cook Booh 113 

into a dish that can be set on the table, well buttered, 
smooth the top or pile it in a rocky form and brush 
over with the yolk. Set in hot oven till brown. 

Potato Puffs. 

2 cups mashed potatoes 2 eggs beaten separate 
2 tablespoons butter ^ cup cream 

Salt and pepper 
Make in puffs large enough for each person; bake in 
oven till brown. 

Brown Potatoes with Roast Beef. 

Peel and put in cold salt water for an hour, then 
put into boiling water (sctlt it) and cook fifteen 
minutes; take out and drain, then put in dripjping-pan 
with the roast beef on the frame. When you baste 
the meat every ten minutes throw the gravy on the 
potatoes also. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. 

Put one tablespoonful of butter in your spider, slice 
one good-sized onion, stir and cook in butter till done; 
add one tablespoon of parsley chopped fine for one 
pint of cold boiled potatoes cut into dice; salt and 
pepper to taste. Fry and stir gently till the potatoes 
are a nice light brown. Put in a hot covered dish. 

Another Lyonnaise Potato. 

To a pint of thin sliced cold boiled potatoes put a 
chopped onion cooked in one tablespoon of butter, oRe 
half pint of milk, with pepper and salt; cover and 
stew fifteen minutes. Wet a half teaspoon of 'corn 
starch in cold milk and stir in a spoon of minced pars- 
ley. Can add more milk and butter if liked. 



1 14 The Queen Cook Book 

New Potatoes 4 la Cream 

Wash new potatoes and scrape off the skin; put 
them in boiling water, a little salt; as soon as tender 
take up and cut into four pieces. While these are 
boiling put some new milk or cream, say half pint for 
a pint of potatoes, a piece of butter the size of a small 
egg and salt. Mix an even tablespoon of flour with 
cold milk, stir into cream, boil enough to cook the 
flour and pour over the potatoes. 

Small Potatoes Creamed or Hashed. 

Chop cold boiled potatoes, put a spoon of butter in 
spider, put in the potatoes, salt, enough sweet milk 
and cream to nearly cover them; wet a spoon of flour 
with cold milk and stir in. Anything warmed over 
needs enough cooking to give it a flavor, that merely 
being wanned can not give it. 

Saratoga Potatoes. 

Wash and peel the potatoes and cut them in very thin 
slices, either with a knife or a slaw cutter; lay them in 
cold water for a time, then drain them in a dish, and 
put them on a dry cloth, patting the top with another 
dry cloth. Have in your spider hot fat as for fried 
cakes. When ready to put some in the fat, have it 
boiling hot and remove it to back of stove till they are 
in, so as to avoid its running over. Put in only a few 
at a time or they will stick together. Have ready a 
piece of cheese-cloth thrown over a colander, when 
light brown skim them into the cloth and drain; 
sprinkle salt on both sides, and set in the heater till all 
are done; going through the same process till all are 
cooked. Serve hot. What is left can be heated over 
the next day 



The Queen Cook Book 115 

Potato Croquettes. 

To one quart of hot mashed potatoes, add one-half 
cup of hot milk, two generous tablespoons of butter, 
one teaspoon of salt, well beaten in. Beat the whites 
of two eggs stiff and stir in. Form into croquettes (if 
you wish to fry them in spider flatten them, if in hot 
fat, do not) roll them in the yolks of the eggs and 
then in cracker crumbs, lay in a croquette basket and 
immerse in boiling hot fat till brown. 

Potato Salad. 

One pint of cold boiled potatoes cut into dice, two 
hard boiled eggs cut fine, one teaspoon of finely minced 
cold onion and one tablespoon of chopped parsley; 
mix well together. For dressing, stir into three table- 
spoons of butter gradually three tablespoons of vin- 
egar; one saltspoon salt, and half spoon pepper. Mix 
well. Keep dressing in cold place. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes. 

Lay nicely cleaned medium sized potates on the up- 
per grate, in a hot oven, in their skins; when nearly 
baked, take a towel in your hand and crack them; 
leave them in five minutes longer to let the moisture 
evaporate. Serve hot after the family sits down. 

Steamed Sweet Potatoes. 

Steam them in a steamer with skins on; do not let 
them get over done. Peel them quickly with a white 
metal or silver knife or fork. Never use a steel one 
for sweet potatoes as it turns the potato black where- 
ever it touches it. Sweet potatoes are too watery to 
boil in water*

Fried Sweet Potatoes. 

Cold steamed potatoes are nice for breakfast cut 
either long or round, salt them, and fry in spider in 
half butter and half lard or drippings. A little brown 
on both sides. 

Cooked Over Sweet Potatoes. 

Cut cold steamed sweet potatoes in dice like pieces 
or bits; to one pint of potato put two tablespoons of 
butter, salt and pepper to taste, fry till a nice brown, or 
not as you like, then to a half pint of beef stock, one 
even tablespoon of flour and one well beaten egg, let 
boil two minutes. 

Sweet Corn Boiled. 

Husk and silk the corn, put the ears of corn in a 
kettle, in cold soft water, let come slowly to a boil, 
boil for five minutes. Put it in hot covered dish. Set 
the kettle on back of stove and keep it in the water 
till ready to eat it. It will be sweet and juicy. I pre- 
fer no salt in it, but put salt and butter on as I eat it. 
A common mistake of otherwise good cooks is to boil 
corn half an hour. This could not fail to make it hard 
and indigestible. Overcooking brings it into disre- 
pute as a vegetable, while if freshly picked and cooked 
properly it is delicate and healthful. For eating at the 
table, some score each row of corn with a sharp knife, 
then butter and salt it and eating the center of the 
grain, leave the hull on the cob, it is for some more 
healthy. 

Succotash.

ing.) Boil the beans till tender in soft water. When 
half done add the salt. Score and press from the cob 
twice as much corn by measure as there are beans. 
When the beans are well cooked with hardly enough 
water to cover the beans then set the kettle off the 
fire. Add to the corn three-fourths of a pint of cream 
or milk, two tablespoons of butter, salt and pepper to 
taste; pour this slowly on the beans; when hot stir in 
one even tablespoon of flour to make the consistency 
of thin cream. Boil it five minutes. This caa be 
made in winter from canned corn and beans. Canned 
corn can be cooked for table in same way. 

To Dry Corn. 

Husk and silk it, then place it in boiler in cold rain 
water (water must be pure); let come slowly to a boil; 
boil five minutes, take out as fast as you can in a large 
dish; cut it while hot, but not too close to get the 
hulls, picking off all the silk you see (much of it comes 
off in the water); then run your fingers through it and 
dip your fingers in a bowl of water, and pick it all 
over carefully to get the silk all out, for it is too much 
like a hair to be pleasant in the mouth. Then spread 
on the drier if you have one. I dry one and a half 
bushels at a time on mine in one-half of a day and 
evening. It takes three of us one-half a day to get 
such a quantity ready to put on the drier. It needs 
scraping up together and respreading as fast as it dries, 
and almost constant attention. It will dry in six or 
seven hours. If you have no drier put it on plates 
and platters around the stove,. changing and turning 
often. This will ^ dry in eighteen hours. Put it in 
tight bags and hang in a dry cool place. 



ii8 The Queen Cock Book 

To Cook Dried Corn. 

One cup full of the corn will be sufficient for six or 
more persons. Put cold water on it, and the hulls 
that rise on top pour off, then put on cold soft or rain 
water about one pint and a half, all it will soak up, 
set it where it will keep quite warm, in an earthen 
dish or a good tin basin. It will soak in five or six 
hours. Then put in^ sweet cream and milk, butter, 
salt, pepper and a little flour. ' Just boil long enough 
to cook the flour. This is delicious when rightly pro- 
portioned, according to quantity of corn. The sweet 
corn must be of the best. 

Mrs. Roreir's way of drying sweet corn: **Score the 
corn down the center of each row of grains, then with 
the back of the knife press out all the pulp, leaving 
the hull on the cob.*' Spread this pulp raw on plates 
and dry around stove. It will brown easily, so watch 
it closely. 

Roast Green Corn. 

Mrs. Herrick says that " corn is excellent roasted 
in this way. Select tender ears, turn the husks and 
remove the silk, then re-cover the corn with the husks. 
Lay on the bottom of the oven with grate under, 
turning often." I should think in a hot 6ve;i it would 
roast in from twenty to thirty minutes. 

Mock Oysters. 

Grate six good sized ears of sweet corn; rub it 
through a hair-sieve to rid it of the hulls; add two well 
beaten eggs, two tablespoons of thick cream, one 
tablespoon of butter, two of fine rolled cracker, one 
teaspoon salt, one-fourth of pepper. Beat this all 
well together; have a lump of good butter about the 



The Queen Cook Book 1 19 

size of half an egg; when hot on griddle drop the corn 
mixture in tablespoonfuls, allowing space that they do 
not run together; when they are a nice brown turn 
them over and brown the other side; it requires about 
five minutes to cook them. This will make about two 
dozen oysters; serve them hot. They can be cooked 
while the table is being waited on. 

« 

Corn Fritters. "i / 

* / 



Prepare one dozen ears of corn the same as for 
mock oysters and put it in fritter batter made of two 
eggs beaten separately, one cup of flour, one teaspoon 
of baking powder, one-half pint of milk, salt and pep- 
per. Fry in hot fat, drop in by spoonfuls in the fat. 
So soon as brown on both sides they are done. Take 
out with a wire skimmer, drain on good plain brown 
paper. 

Beets. 

Wash the beets but do not break the skin. It takes 
from one to four* hours to boil, according to age. An 
old or wilted beet will never be eatable. When ten- 
der put them in a pan of cold water and quickly rub 
ofl the skins with the hand, keeping them as hot as 
possible, slice them round and put butter, salt, pep- 
per and hot vinegar on them and set in the heater. 
Be sure ygu have the rich, long, blood beet. 

Baked Beets. 

It is not, perhaps, generally known that common 
beets baked in the same manner as potatoes are much 
sweeter and drier than when boiled; peel them and 
dish them up the same as boiled beets.

Curing Beets for Winter Use. 

Take up the beets before freezing time, boil tender, 
skin and slice round, put them in glass fruit jars, pack 
in as tight as you can, then fill jars with cold cider 
vinegar (this is done to know how much vinegar is 
needed), pour ofl and bring vinegar to a boil. For 
each jar add one tablespoon of sugar, a small amount 
of cayenne pepper, a little salt, pour it over the beets 
hot; then screw tight as you would fruit. Take 
medium sized beets and good blood red. This is a 
good way to have sweet and tender pickled beets for 
winter use, 

Boiled Turnips. 

Wash and pare the turnips, cut into quartets, put 
into boiling water, boil till tender, say thirty minutes, 
pour off the water and set on stove to dry, then press 
out all the water, add butter and salt, mash fine, dish 
and sprinkle with pepper. They are drier to be 
steamed; or you can slice and fry them to eat with 
roast duck. Good turnips or beets are seldom found 
now-a-days. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Scald them by pouring boiling water on them, let 
stand for five minutes, pour it off, peel them, cut out 
the hard stem end and hard cores, as you slice them. 
Cook them in a granite or a porcelain lined sauce- 
pan, put to about a quart of tomatoes a tablespoon of 
butter, salt and pepper (they do not bear much salt) 
stew thirty minutes or more and pour on to one heap- 
ing tablespoon of rolled crackers in dish. 



The Queen Cook Book 121 



To Can Tomatoes. 

Prepare in the same way leaving out the butter, 
pepper and rolled cracker. 

Raw Tomatoes. 

Scald and pour off the water, peel, slice them intp 
dish, pour off the juice, salt and pepper them, let 
persons put on sugar and vinegar to suit them- 
selves, or prepare a mayonnaise dressing. 

Carrots Stewed and Fried. 

Pare and boil whole, salt the water, boil till tender, 
from thirty to sixty minutes, then slice round, put 
butter, salt and pepper or a cream sauce, or slice and 
brown them in spider. All vegetables must be taken 
up the minute they are done. 

Boiled Parsnips. 

Scrape and put in boiling water, add salt, boil till 
tender, say from thirty to fifty minutes; drain and dry 
them, then slice, put on butter, salt and pepper, or a 
cream sauce; or, take the boiled parsnips sliced and 
brown them, after seasoning, or mash them and stir 
into fritter batter. 

Green Peas. 

Peas are better if picked and shelled just Defore 
cooking. Wash the pods clean before shelling, 
as washing the peas takes off the juices which we 
always find in young peas, and gives them their de- 
licious flavor, but you can not find it in an old pea. 
Boil in cold rain water for about thirty minutes, add 



123 Th0 Queen C oak Book 

salt When tender add cream, butter, salt an<l pep* 
per, a very little flour, according to quantity. Every- 
thing depends upon the seasoning of peas, beans» or 
oysters or anything else in the cooking depai^ent. 

Lima Bean3. 

Green beans of all kinds should be cooked the same 
as green peas, also string beans after they are strung 
and cut in half-inch pieces, being careful to remove 
all that is stringy. All dried beans are dished in the 
same way, after being cooked tender in rainwater, add 
the salt. 

Boston Baked Beans. 

Put three quarts of warm soft water on one quart 
of the small white bean, after washing, let soak over 
night (this to soak out the rank oil contained in the 
thick skin) turn off this water and rinse them 
thoroughly. Add cold water and boil ten minutes, 
pour this off and put on boiling water and boil till half 
done, then put in about one pound of well salted pork 
until half cooked to season the beans, if they are not 
sufficiently salt add more. Have a teakettle of hot soft 
water on stove to replenish with. (If you have to use 
hard water soften it with a little soda.) Take out the 
pork and boil the beans until they can be easily 
mashed between the thumb and finger; then put the 
beans into a deep earthen bean pot, and the salt pork 
buried in the beans all but the rind, which should be 
gashed one-half inch apart. Some like one tablespoon 
of molasses in the beans. If you prefer you can leave 
out the pork and the molasses, and stir in instead two 
tablespoons of good butter. Put on cover and bake 
from six to eight hours, taking the cover off the last 
hour to brown and crisp the top and rind of pork. 



The "QueenCt^k ^ook 123 

Add boiling water from time to time, as it may need 
to prevent burning. This is Boston baked beans. 
But if you do not wish to bake them so long you can 
bake them from one to two hours in a tin dish. 



Pickled Beans. 

Wash and string tender green beans, put into a 
kettle of boiling water, add salt and boil till tender, 
say twenty-five minutes. When done, drain in a col- 
ander and let stand until cold; then put into a glass 
jar, sprinkle over a little cayenne pepper, add a table- 
spoon chopped liorseradish and cover with good vin- 
egar. A nice relish. 

Asparagus on Toast. 

Wash it well, tie it in bundles of tiE$n or fifteen stalks, 
with a well-washed cord, and cut them of equal lengths, 
from three to four inches long, boil in hot water, a 
little salt; .when it first comes it will cook in fifteen 
minutes, and at the last it may take thirty. Great 
care should be taken not to over-cook it, as some do. 
As soon as tender, pour off nearly all the water, and 
add sufficient cream and milk, butter, pepper, and salt, 
according to quantity, to season and make sufficient 
gravy to put on toast or plain bread (one-half slice each) 
enough for the numb^ of petBons. Butter the toast 
or bread as for eating; thicken it only as thick as thin 
cream. This is nice for dinner or supper. Do not 
cut off the cord till you lay it on the toast, then cut it 
and let one bunch be for each half'-slice and fall open, 
then .pour on the gravy or sauce and a sprinkle of 
pepper; serve soon. Some cut the asparagus in inch 
long pieces.

Salsify and Parsnips. 

Grate a bunch or two of salsify, as you would horse- 
radish, add a raw egg beaten, rolled cracker or flour, 
and fry as you would oysters. Parsnips Drepared in 
this way are extremely nice. 

Fried Salsify or Mock Oysters. 

Scrape the roots, lay in cold water fifteen minutes, 
put them in boiling water, cook till tender, then drain 
and mash fine, picking out all the fiber. Moisten with 
one teacup of cream, a little milk; add a tablespoon of 
butter and three eggs for every two cups of salsify. 
Beat the eggs light. Make into round cakes, dredge 
with flour and fry brown. 

Boiled Cauliflower. 

Select close heads, trim and open the flower in 
water to remove any insects. Soak in salt and water 
for an hour before cooking, then put them in boiling 
water with a little salt, cook till tender, slowly. Can 
tie up in piece of cheese-cloth to prevent them break- 
ing, or if not lift out with a skimmer. Serve with 
dra^n butter, adding a well beaten egg or mayonnaise 
sauce. 

Boiled Onions. 

Pour boiling water over the onions, drain ofif, this 
will prevent the smarting of the eyes, then peel, put 
them over to boil in cold water and boil slowly for fif- 
teen minutes, then pour off this water to take out the 
strong taste, and put in more boiling water and cook 
till tender; put salt in when cooking; pour off this 
watery and put on cream and butter or jmilk^ season,

and thicken a little and boil it five minutes, put it in 
covered dish. Do not boil vegetables on the gallop 
as it makes them fall to pieces. 

Celery and Radishes. 

Clean with a brush (a new stiff tooth-brush is the 
best), put in a celery glass with water and eat with 
salt. 

Celery — Cooked. 

Clean and cut in pieces one-half inch long, cover 
with soup stock and boil till tender, remember the 
salt. Rub one tablespoon of butter and one of 
flour together and stir in and dish. 

Dandelions. 

These are used for greens in the early spring. Do 
not use them after they blossom, as then they are 
bitter. Cook only the leaves; wash them in two 
waters, leaf by leaf. It is safer for the lady of the 
house to see to this herself, as then she can feel sure 
there are no bugs or stray weeds. Simply boil in 
water with a little salt, until tender, from twenty to 
thirty minutes; drain well and eat with vinegar or 
mayonnaise sauce. 

Cooking Cabbage. 

Almosi every one likes cauliflower if it is properly 
cooked, while few admit a fondness for cabbage. Yet 
it belongs to the same family and is improved by cook- 
ing well. It should first be parboiled one-half hour in a 
porcelain kettle; a little salt, then drained, and put on 
fresh boiling water and cooked until tender two hours. 
Serve with this dressing: 



126 The Queen Cook Booh 



Cabbage Dressing* 

Three tablespoons of vinegar, one teaspoon of salt, 
a piece of butter the size of an egg; mix altogether and 
let them just come to a boil. Let them cool off 
a little and then thicken with a beaten egg; boil up 
again, then thicken with milk or cream, as you have. 

Sauerkraut. 

Squeeze the cabbage out of the brine, wash it in 
one or two cold waters, drain; put it in porcelain ket- 
tle, cover with cold water, boil two hours; pour into 
colander, press out the water, replace in vessel. Pre- 
pare a dressing of one tablespoon of butter and one of 
flour, stir in pan on the fire until a light brown color. 
Mix this well with one quart of kraut.

macaroni and cheese ;stir until thoroughly heated, add 
salt and pepper, and serve. Mrs, Rorer. 

Oyster Macaroni. 

Boil macaroni the same as above, put a layer in a 
dish with butter, salt and pepper, then a layer of 
oysters and alternate until the dish is full. Mix 
some grated bread or rolled cracker with a beaten 
egg. Spread over top and bake. 

Cream Macaroni. 

Select macaroni that is of a brownish color, rather 
than of a pure white. Spaghetti is the most delicate 
form of macaroni that comes to this country. 

For a dish holding three pints one-half pound of 
spaghetti will be required. Have ready a kettle full 
of boiling water, salted. Take the spaghetti all up 
together, in the long sticks without breaking. Hold 
the ends in the boiling water; in an instant it will all 
go down into the water. Whirl it round and round 
with a fork to thoroughly separate it, then allow it to 
boil hard for twenty minutes. When done, put it in 
a colander and pour cold water through it (this is 
called blanching). After it is drained, put it into the 
dish in which it is to be baked. 

For the Cream Gravy. 

Put one and one-half pints of milk on in double 
boiler. Stir smoothly together three tablespoons of floul 



128 The Queen Cook Book 

and three scant tablespoons of butter. When smooth, 
stir carefully into the boiling milk, stirring till Hour is 
cooked. Then add three tablespoons of grated cheese. 
Parmesan is best, but any strong cheese will answer. 
Pour it over the macaroni in the dish, sprinkle a little 
more cheese over the top and put in the oven to 
brown. Do not put the cream and macaroni together 
till ready to go into the oven, as the cream will 
curdle if allowed to stand on the macaroni. 

Mrs. Rorer, 



Toasted Cheese. 

One-half pound of rich cheese is enough for four 
slices of toast. Cut the cheese thin in slices a little 
smaller than the toast, and put it in buttered tin 
in oven to toast. While this is toasting, toast the 
bread, salt and butter it. Put cheese on toast. 
Serve hot. Mrs, Rorer. 

Cheese Straws. 

2 ounces flour A little cayenne and salt 

3 ounces grated Parmesan Yolk of one egg 
cheese 

Mix flour, cayenne, salt and cheese together, and 
moisten with the egg; work all into a smooth paste. 
Roll out on a board, one-eighth of an inch thick, five 
inches wide, and five inches long. Cut some of the 
paste in small rings and some in strips of one-eighth 
of an inch wide. Place both on greased sheets and 
bake ten minutes in an oven (240 Fahr.) till a light 
brown. Then put the straws through the rings like a 
bundle of sticks. Mrs. Rorer.

Stock for Sauces and Gravies. 

In every family of five or six persons or more, there 
will be many bones and fragments of meat left from 
roasts and steaks either cooked or uncooked or both 
which can be utilized for making stock or puree for 
gravies and sauces for various kinds of meats, fish or 
croquettes. Put into a granite or porcelain kettle, the 
bones and pieces of meats from yesterday's and 
to-day*s cooking (do not use any older bits for they 
loose their virtue by standing) ; with as little water as 
will cook well, and boil slowly for three hours, 
covered tight; salt it just right for eating; have 
the quantity of broth according to the nourishment 
contained in the meat. This will not often be rich 
enough for soups; strain it through a soup strainer, 
when cold take off the fat. In winter it will keep a 
week. In large families it can be prepared twice 
a week. To make nice gravies is only difficult to the 
inexperienced. You will soon learn to use good judg- 
ment and be a good taster.

nice for warmed over roasts. 

Caper Sauce. 

Is made by adding two tablespoons of capers to the 
drawn butter sauce. See the recipe.

Currant Jelly Sauce. 

Add five tablespoons of the jelly to the drawn butter 
and let it boil up once. Serve with any wild game. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

This should always be served with roast turkey, 
either in the form of jam or jelly. 

Lobster Sauce. 

Add one cup of lobster to drawn butter, chopped 
fine, and rubbed to a paste with a spoon of butter. 
Nice with fishi Oyster sauce for roast turkey is made 
the same way, using the oyster broth and chopping the 
oysters. 

Celery Sauce. 

5 roots celery i pint cold water

Clean the celery, cut it into small pieces, put it in a 
saucepan (granite); stew slowly about thirty minutes; 
press it through a colander. Mix the butter and flour 
to a cream; put all together; stir continually, letting 
it boil two minutes. Good with boiled fowl. 

Cream Dressing No. 2. 

When oil is disliked in salads the following dressing 
will be found excellent: Rub the yolks of two hard- 
boiled eggs very smooth with a silver spoon. Stir 
gradually in a teaspoon of mixed mustard, a table- 
spoon of softened butter, half a cup of thick cream, a 
a saltspoon of salt, cayenne pepper the size of a small 
pea, a few drops of anchovy or Worcestershire sauce

m 

time mixing it with the flour; add the ice water, 
gradually, stirring it with your fingers. Not all the 
water, perhaps, as some flours swell more than 
others. Then put it on board in the roughest form 
(never knead or work it) ; dredge it with flour and roll 
quickly into a long, thin sheet. Cut one-fourth of the 
butter you have left in little bits and put on crust; sift 
on a sprinkle of flour; double it over, roll out the same 
way; repeat this three times, using all the butter. 
Then put it in cold place to stiffen and it is ready for 
tarts, pies or patties. 

For Tarts or Patties. 

Cut out With a cooky cutter three layers. Take 
a pepper-box cover and cut out the center of two 
layers and lay on top of the whole one, which makes 
one tart. The crust should be rolled very thin; bake, 
then fill with jelly a short time before using. Another 
very pretty way is to take an open-top thimble or 
something as small and cut three or five holes in the 
two top layers; after baking lift them off, put a slice of 
jelly on the lower layer; put the two upper layers on, 
squeezing up the jelly through the holes; this has 
a pretty effect. For patties use a little larger cutter; 
a sharp cutter is the best. The oven should have 
a strong under heat, so they will rise before browning. 
If oven is too hot open the draughts, or put a basin of 
cold water in oven. 

Tart Crust. 

The white of one egg i tablespoon white sugar 

I cup butter i even teaspoon salt 

3 cups sifted flour 5 tablespoons cold water 

Beat the egg stiff, and prepare the same way as for 
puff paste.

Pie Crust. 

I ^ pounds flour i pound butter 

Wash the butter, have every thing as cold as possi- 
ble, use less than a half pint of very cold water. Rub 
the butter and teaspoon salt in the flour with the 
hands, then stir the water in with the fingers, put it in 
the rough on the molding board, roll out, cut it in 
wide strips, put one upon another, then cut in squares 
to make the size for each plate and roll out for the 
pie plates. It will be better to set the dough on ice 
before rolling out. Never press on the crust after it 
is on the plate. Wet the rim of under crust with 
water to make the crusts unite, so as to retain the 
juices. 

Plain Pie Crust. 

Plain but good family pie crust is made with one 
pound of flour and one-half bound of butter, or three 
cups of sifted flour and one cup of butter, rub them well 
together, so that when you squeeze it in your hand it 
will remain in form; add cold water enough to make a 
stiff dough; do not make it too wet, as it makes it 
tough to work it over. Roll out just enough for the 
one plate. This last quantity is enough for two pies. 

Pie Crust with Lard. 

4 cups sifted flour i y^ cups lard or butter 

I heaping teaspoon salt % cup ice cold water 

Rub the lard and salt lightly into the flour and stir 
in the water with fingers of one hand, flour the board 
and roller, and roll it in the rough, do not work it at 
all, as it makes it tough. I have eaten very flaky and 
tender crust made of lard, also of half lard and half 
butter. 



1 36 The Queen Cook Book 



A Good Plain Pie Crust. 

Sift one quart of flour (which is one pound) into your 
bowl and a teaspoon of salt, heaping. Lard requires 
more salt than butter. Rub in one teacup of fresh 
lard, stir in one cup of very cold water to make it stiff 
enough to roll; handle it deftly and as little as possi- 
ble; flour the board and pin, roll out very thin; re- 
member to roll from you. Have ready one teacup of 
good butter that has been washed in two cold waters, 
spread one^third of the butter on the dough, sprinkle 
with flour; fold it over, then roll it out thin again; 
spread with bits of butter again and roll out, making 
four times, to use all the butter. Then roll out, after 
setting the pan in ice water to get cold, just enough for 
one crUst at a time. This will make crust enough for 
two or three pies according to size. 

Apple Pie. 

Wash and peel tender sour apples, slice them very 
thin. Put the under crust on the pie plate and fill it 
sufliciently full to be right when cooked. Flavor with 
either nutmeg or cinnamon as you like or allspice, 
put bits of butter all around, cover with sugar one-half 
cup of water, dip the fingers in water and always wet 
the rim of crust all round, then roll out the upper 
crust neither too thick nor too thin, double it together 
and cut three gashes in center, lay it on the pie, cut 
the edges smooth, prick it with a fork five times to let 
the air out. If the apples are not tender partly cook 
them, but you must have tart apples to make a good 
pie. Some expert cooks put nothing in but water, 
till the pie is baked, then lift the upper crust off whole 
while hot and stir in the sugar, butter and flavoring. 



The Queen Coek Book 137 

PiB Plant or Rhubarb Pie. 

\yash the stalks of rhubarb and peel off the thin 
stringy skin by stripping it down, then cut it in one- 
half inch pieces. Line a deep pie plate with crust, 
fill it nearly full of pieplant, grate nutmeg on it, sift a 
little flour, put bits of butter on, one cup of sugar, 
one-third cup of molasses, no water, as it is juicy of 
itself. Roll the crust out the same as for apple pie, 
only squeeze the edges together to retam the juices. 
The oven must be only just to a slow boiling heat or 
the syrup will all boil out. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

This requires only the under crust with a rim; this 
is best made by rolling the crust about an inch larger 
than the plate, then you have a continuous circle to 
lay on the edge of plate, about three-fourths of an 
inch wide, wet the edge of under crust where you lay 
it on; put the rim all around, do not press on it, and 
it is ready to fill. Be sure you have a good pumpkin, 
cut in two, dig out the seeds and inside, bake on grate 
in a hot oven until soft, or steam it, it is richer baked. 
(In cold weather you can bake enough for twice, keep- 
ing in a cool place; they should be ^aten the day they 
are baked, though you can scald them over.) Scrape 
out the pulp, press it through a colander. The most 
delicate pie is made by using one-third pumpkin, one- 
third milk, one-third eggs and cream or milk as you 
have it, nutmeg, a little salt, one teaspoon ginger, 
one-half teaspoon cinnamon. Some like it half pump- 
kin, it is more solid. This is for one pie. Two eggs 
are good, but three are better. Two large spoons sugar ; 
some pumpkins are sweeter than others. Heat the 
mixture hot when ready to fill the pie and bake; have

138 The Queen Cook Book 

a hot oven. Beat well into the pumpkin all the spices 
and sugar, then the milk, and last the well beaten 
eggs. 

Hubbard Squash Pie. 

I large coffee cup new i large coffee cup squash 
milk I teaspoon salt 

1 large coffee cup of 2 or ]/^ nutmeg 

3 beaten eggs filled up J^ cup sugar 
with cream i teaspoon Jamaica ginger 

The squash is prepared the same way as the pump- 
kin. In baking it cover it with thick brown paper, 
stand it on grate or a brick, bake double the quantity 
you need, as it will keep in a cold place two or three 
days. The crust and filling prepared the same 
as the pumpkin. This is the measure for one pie. 
You will see the proportion is one-third squash to the 
other ingredients. 

Hubbard Squash or Pumpkin Pie. 

4 eggs beaten separately 4 tablespoons sugar 

2 cups squash or pumpkin 2 cups milk or i of crean^ 
I teaspoon cinnamon J^ grated nutmeg 

Last thing stir in the whites, i teaspoon ginger 

Cherry Pie. 

Wash the cherries, take out the pits; line a deep 
plate with crust, fill with the fruit having two thick 
layers (first drain off the juice) sift a good tablespoon 
of flour, bits of butter on it, one full cup of brown 
sugar, three-fourths cup of molasses (no water or 
juice) then cover, not forgetting to wet the edge of 
under crust and pressing the edges together. Bake 
in hot oven. Whenever your oven \% too hot always 



The Queen Cook Book 139 

put in a basin of cold water or open the dampers. If 
the heat js just at a boiling point, the syrup will not 
run out and the pie is delicious. A handful of cherry 
pits scattered in the pie, adds to the flavor; but 
do not do it if there are any children in the family. 

Peach Pie. 

Line your plate with good crust, peel and slice the 
peaches with a silver knife, fill the plate, sift one 
tablespoon of flour, sprinkle one-half cup or more of 
sugar on, add one-third of a cup of water. Be careful to 
wet the edge of lower crust before covering the pie, 
so the edges will adhere together and retain the juice 
in the pie and add much to its richness. Crack five or 
six of the pits and put the meats in the pie, for flavor- 
ing if you like. 

Cream Pie. 

Line a deep pie plate with a rich paste and fill with 
a custard made of the yolks of three eggs, three table- 
spoons of sugar, one tablespoon of flour, one teaspoon 
or more of vanilla, one pint of milk or part cream. 
When the pie is baked, carefully spread a layer of 
orange jelly or any jelly or jam you like over the top 
(warm it if too stiff to spread easily), then a meringue 
made of the whites of the- eggs, two tablespoons of 
powdered sugar and vanilla. Spread the meringue 
evenly but not smoothly and brown slightly in a 
moderately heated oven. Serve cold. 

Cream Pie No. 2. 

Beat two eggs well, add four even tablespoons of 
sugar, one pint of sweet cream, flavor with nutmeg or 
vanilla. Great care should be taken not to bake any 



T40 The Quicn Cook Book 

custard too long, as it will soon turn to whey, after it 
is at boiling point. 

Custard Pie, 

To one pint of milk add two beaten eggs with three 
tablespoons of sugar, a dust of salt, flavor with nut- 
meg. Line the pie plate with crust and a rim and 
bake as in the above recipe. 

CocoANUT Pie. 

I cup grated cocoanut 3 eggs 

4 tablespoons sugar i teaspoon butter^ salt 

I lemon i pint miUc 

Grate a cocoanut after removing the outer shell and 
the inner skin, stram the milk it contains tbroi^h a 
cloth if you like to use it, if not, use a pint of boiled 
milk, stir in the cocoanut, then the butter and beaten 
yolks, sugar, the grated rind and strained juice of half 
a lemon, lastly Uie stifHy beaten whites or make a 
meringue made by sweetening the well-beaten eggs 
with two large spoonfuls of sugar and spread it on top 
with a good sprinkle of cocoanut after it is baked, and 
return on the grate until delicately browned. Line 
the pie plate with best pie crust and fill. All pies 
with Only one crust must have a rim laid on it.

heaping tablespoons of powdered sugar, spread on top, 
and brown. 

Lemon Pie No. 2. 

I lemon i tablespoon corn starch 

1 cup sugar 2 eggs, salt a little 
Butter the size of an ^g%* 2 cups hot water 

Stir up the corn starch in a little cold water and 
pour it in the hot water and let boil enough to cook 
the starch (say one minute), let cool, then add the 
butter, sugar and beaten eggs, and lemon, grated rind 
and strained juice. Make a meringue of the whites of 
two eggs and three spoons of sugar. Some bake the 
shell or crust first, lightly, then fill and bake the filling, 
for all lemon or custard pies. 

Lemon Pie No. i. (Very Fine.) 

2 lemons 3 eggs 

8 tablespoons sugar i cup water 

2 even tablespoons flour 
Grate the rind and strain the juice of the lemons, 
stir the flour up with the water, then add the sugar 
and beaten yolk, then the juice and grated rind. 
Bake with an under crust; have ready when it comes 
from th^ oven, the whites beaten to a stiff froth, with 
four tablespoons of pulverized sugar; spread over the 
pie, set in oven, and brown as quickly as possible, to 
avoid being leathery. Home Messenger. 

Orange Pie. 

Slice three or four oranges into a plate lined with 
paste, sprinkle well with sugar, two tablespoons of 
water, cover with paste. This is nice, but orange 
shortcake is better.

Sponge Cake Cream Pie. 

One teacup of sugar, one teacup of flour with one 
teaspoon baking powder, three eggs beaten separately. 
Bake it in two layer cakes. Whip a pint of very cold 
sweet cream until very smooth and stiff; first sweeten

placing the other on top. If one likes one can spread 
the top with cream and cocoanut. Should be eaten 
the same day. 

Lemon Tarts.

berries and drain well; fill the crust pretty full; 
sprinkle two tablespoons of flour on top, bits of butter, 
a little salt; cover the berries with a cup of brown 
sugar and a sprinkle of water. Pinch the edges

one egg, a pinch of salt; flavor with essence of lemon; 
beat well together and boil a minute to cook the flour. 
Flavor them both with the same flavoring. When 
cold spread on one cake and lay the other on top. Or 
if you like it better, instead, spread any kind of fruit 
jam or apple marmalade or cocoanut on top. 

Mince Pies. 

4 pounds solid beef 6 pounds tart raw apples 

3 coffee cups chopped suet i quart boiled cider 
2 pounds raisins i quart molasses . 

4 pints brown sugar 4 pints water 

4 teaspoons cinnamon 4 teaspoons cloves 

2 nutmegs 
If you wish the whole quantity, purchase five pounds 
of solid lean meat (the best of the round is good), as 
there is some waste; in boiling the meat allow one 
pound for loss, in boiling such a quantity. Salt it 
right for eating when you put it over, in boiling hot 
water; boil until just tender; set away to get cool over 
night, then cut in small pieces and chop it fine, so it 
will be neither coarse grained nor pasty, then weigh it. 
Peel the apples, quarter, core and chop them; wash 
and wipe them before peeling, and then weigh the 
quarters before chopping. Wash and seed the raisins, 
but do not chop them; chop the suet fine, mix all to- ' 
gether in a large earthen dish. Do not use all the 
water, let the mince meat stand for two days (as it 
will swell some), in a cool place; you can add more 
water, cider, or sugar, as you think it needs, after 
baking one pie to try it. They do not taste so sweet 
after baking. Bake well done, three-fourths of an 
hour. These are nice to mS.ke in winter, as you can 
bake up as many as you like, according to the size of

the family, from ten to twenty at a time. Keep them 
in a cold room, but do not freeze them. Put the 
mince meat that is left in a crock and cover the top 
with writing paper. It will keep in a cold place three 
months, only it must not freeze. For a small family 
of four I only make one-half the quantity. I grate the 
nutmeg in each pie as I make it, with bits of butter 
before putting the crust on. It requires practice to 
learn to make good pastry for mince pies (I do not 
mean puff paste), and also not to fill them too full. I 
have used this recipe ever since 1843, s^i^d have never 
wished for any better for any occasion. It it is pal- 
atable and healthy. 

The two following recipes I take from the Messen- 
ger, but I think them too rich for health; neither do I 
think it a good plan to boil the mince meat: 

Mince Pies. 

3 pounds fresh beef i fresh beef tongue 

4 or 6 pounds suet 3^ pounds raisins 
% pound citron 3 pounds currants 
8 pounds chopped apples 45^ pounds sugar 

I pint molasses 3 ounces cinnamon 

I teacup mace compound 2 ounces cloves 

I J^ ounces salt i nutmeg 

J^ ounce pepper i ^ gallons sweet cider 

When mixed put into a kettle and scald, stirring it 
all the time. Put it hot into Hero or Mason jars — 
two quart or gallon jars — and the longer you keep it 
the nicer it will be. When making up your pies you 
can add a teacup of finely chopped apples for each pie.

PUDDINGS. 

Fifty-six years ago there were but few recipes for 
puddings or pies, both being considered as an extra 
dish for company. A recipe book of 1838, which was 
the one I tried to follow, when I first went to house- 
keeping in 1842, gave recipes for only twelve puddings 
and seven different kinds of pies. How uncertain I 
found them* I shall never forget my first baked Indian 
pudding. I mixed it ready to bake, and left it for 
the girl to bake (as I was invited out to dine), accord- 
ing to directions in the book, three to four hours. It 
was more like a rock than a delightful suet pudding. 
I soon left the book to lie on the shelf for future ages 
to explore. Some puddings are good either cold or 
hot. A baked pudding is not as acceptable immedi- 
ately from the oven as one covered and cooled for ten 
minutes. A blistering hot pudding is anything but 
acceptable, no matter how delicate the article may be.

A Delicate Baked Rice Pudding. 

5 tablespoons rice 3]^ pints milk 

6 tablespoons sugar i teaspoon salt 

j4 cup raisins Fl avor with nutmeg 

Stir the ingredients well together, and cover the 
pudding the first hour of its moderate baking, stirring 
every fifteen minutes, so it will form the cream which 
makes it so delicious. Then uncover and cook slowly 
stirring it . every ten minutes twice, then let it slowly 
brown on the top for ten minutes more, taking one 
and a-half hours to bake. The rice kernels should be 
perfectly soft, amidst the delicate cream that has 
formed of the starch of the rice and the milk. This 
simple pudding when perfectly made and baked, 
eaten cold in summer is as delicious as ice cream. 
Much depends upon the careful baking. It is a 
delight to the housekeeper when she has made a 
gopd dish, to have it baked well, for baking either 
makes or prevents success. 

Rice Pudding. 

3 tablespoons rice i quart milk 

3 tablespoons sugar i even teaspoon salt 

J^ cup raisins Grated nutmeg 

Bake one and a-half hours, same way as the former. 
Serve cold or hot with cold sweet cream. 

Baked Batter Pudding. 

I quart sweet milk 8 eggs beaten separately

in well. Butter the pudding dish and pour in and 
bake immediately from thirty to forty minutes. Serve 
with lemon or cream sauce. Plan so as to eat on 
taking out of the oven, as it is liable to fall when 
exposed to the air. Take one half the quantity for 
four persons. Serve with cream sauce. 

Boiled Batter Pudding. 

I quart sweet milk i pint sifted flouf 

8 eggs beaten separately i teaspoon salt 

Mix this the same way as the baked pudding pre- 
ceeding this. Boil steadily for two hours. Do not 
let the water slacken its boiling for an instant as it will 
fall. Keep a teakettle of boiling water to replenish 
with as it boils out. Get a tin pudding bag or make a 
bag of drilling (unbleached), wash it; you need one 
half a yard long, not quite one half wide, hem both ends 
and run a string in long enough to tie it tight so both 
ends of the pudding will be shaped alike. Sew it up 
with double seam, scald and flour the inside, pour in 
the pudding, leaving one third of the room in bag for 
swelling; have the water boiling when you plunge it in. 
Keep covered tight. Serve with cream or lemon 
sauce. 

Steamed or Boiled Pudding. 

I cup molasses 2j^ cups flour 

I cup sweet milk i teaspoon salt 

% cup softened butter i teaspoon cloves 

J4 teaspoon soda i teaspoon cinnamon.

Stir soda in the molasses; mix all together. Can 
steam it in a tin basin or a tin pudding dish, or boil in 
a bag; follow the directions for boiled batter pudding.

Steam two hours. Use any sauce you like. Cream 
sauce is the most healthy. Lemon sauce is the most 
relishable. 

Genuine English Plum Pudding. 

I lo-cent loaf bread i quart rich milk 

I pound raisins i pound currants 

I pound brown sugar 3 tablespoons flour 

% pound beef suet 2 grated nutmegs 

3 teaspoons cinnamon 2 lemons or oranges 
^ pound cut up citron 10 eggs beaten separately 
Wash and seed your raisins, wash and dry the 
currants, chop the suet and get everything ready the 
day before making; also slice the baker's bread in 
thick slices and dry it in oven and grate it, stir your 
milk in it; then add the other ingredients beating it 
well, adding the whites last. Stir the flour on the 
fruit. Grate the orange peel, just the yellow rind (the 
white is always bitter), squeeze the juice and strain, 
making one-half cup of juice. Mix well and pour into 
a scalded and floured pudding bag if you wish to boil 
it, and place in a kettle of boiling water, and keep hot 
water to replenish with. Boil steadily five hours. Or 
put it in a tin mold or basin and steam it; if your mold 
has a tube in the center it will steam in three hours, if 
not, steam it five hours. This will keep three weeks. 
Leave it in bag and boil or steam it over one hour the 
day you use it. Some add to this two teaspoons of 
extract of nectarine, and three dozen of bitter and 
sweet almonds blanched and powdered. (I use no 
fruits in this pudding, but the raisins and oranges or 
lemons and the spices. I do not think it well to put 
everything into the stomach at once.) Use foaming 
or lemon sauce.

Orange or Lemon Snow Pudding. 

Dissolve one-fourth of a box of ^ejl^ipe jn three 
tablespoons of cold water, then pour on a pint of 
boiling water, one cup of sugar, juic^ of four large 
oranges or two lemons, strain and put it on ice or set 
in very cold water till it begins to stiiffen, then add the 
whites of three eggs beaten stiff; beat well together 
fifteen minutes; put it into molds over night.' Serve 
cold with a custard made of the yolks, or with cream) or 
lemon sauce. I like it better served on table from a 
glass dish. This, if good, all depends upon the flavor- 
ing and sweetening. 

DEUdpus Steam P:cdding. 

I half cup butter i half cup sqgar

Apple Snow Balls. 

Take one or two cups of ^r^shly boiled rice; peel as 
many tart apples as there are persons; core, but do 
not go through the stem end, fill with sugar and grate 
on uutm^. The rice must be cool and stiff enough to 



The Queen Cook Book 157 

handle. Take enough rice in your hand and make a 
hollow in it, place an apple in it, having the rice a 
good half -inch thick all around the apple; set each 
ball in a cloth large enough to cover and tie up. Set 
them in a steamer over boiling water. Steam three- 
fourths of an hour and eat as soon as cooked. These 
are nice to eat with roast duck or goose, or with the 
following sauce as dessert: Braid together two-thirds 
of a cup of butter, one cup sugar and one tablespoon 
flour; pour over it, slowly stirring, one-half pint boiling 
water, and grate in nutmeg, boil a minute to cook the 
flour. Can double this quantity. 

Peach Balls. 

For a dozen peach balls pick over a cup of rice, 
wash it in cold water .till you have poured off all the 
Specks, then in double boiler add a quart of water or 
milk, a heaping teaspoon salt, cook till soft, then stir 
in four tablespoons white sugar, and the yolks of two 
or three raw eggs, and nutmeg; stir together over a 
moderate fire until the yolks begin to thicken; if the 
heat is too intense, the yolks will curdle. As soon as 
the yolks thicken remove the rice from the fire and let 
it cool sufficiently to handle, then heat in the spider 
half lard and half suet, as you would for fried cakes. 
Let this fat get boiling hot, but not burning hot. 
Have ready a plate of rolled cracker afad two well 
beaten eggs; wet the hands in cold water, put a heap- 
ing tablespoon of the well boiled rice in the palm of 
the left hand, and hollow it until it is about half an 
inch thick, into this hollbw lay two hklfs of a fresh 
peach or canned peaches or other fruit as you like. 
Inclose the rice around it, adding more if necessary, 
being careful to have the rice half an inch thick all 



158 The Queen Cook Booh 

around the fruit. The rice must be the right softness 
and stiffness to cling together. Roll each of the balls 
in the eggs, then in the cracker crumbs, put them in the 
smoking hot fat and fry them a golden brown, as fast 
as they brown turn them and drain them in a skim- 
mer, and lay them for a moment on brown paper to 
drip, serve them in covered hot dish; sprinkle with 
powdered sugar or with sweetened cream, flavored as 
you like. 

Chocolate Pudding. 

Grate one and one-half squares of Baker's chocolate, 
not sweet, wet it with a little warm milk, then stir it 
into one quart of boiling hot milk, in double boiler; 
when cooled a little, beat the yolks of six eggs and 
add with one cup of sugar and a pinch of salt, set it 
on stove again (but do not boil it as it will turn to 
whey) till like custard, put it in a pudding dish. Can 
flavor with vanilla. Beat the whites to a stiff froth 
and sift in six tablespoons of powdered sugar and pile 
it lightly on top. Put it in oven just to brown the 
top.

Plain Boiled Rice. 

For a family of four, one small teacup of rice, well 
washed, boiled in one pint and a half of milk, with 
one teaspoon of salt; boil one hour and thirty min- 
utes. Serve with a sauce or sweetened cream and 
nutmeg. There will be enough left to make a rice 
pudding for the next day. 

Rice Pudding. 

Take two cups of cold boiled rice and put it in nearly 
one quart of hot milk, take your clean washed right 
hand and mash it fine; add an even teaspoon of salt, 
three tablespoons of sugar, two beaten eggs, and nut- 
meg. Bake thirty minutes. 

Frozen Pudding. 

The scraps of stale cake, enough milk to moisten 
them; beat four eggs with a quart of milk, and stir 
them over the fire in double boiler until they begin to 
thicken; then remove, and beat the stale cake into the 
custard, about two cups to each quart. If you like 
add a cup of fresh fruit or canned to each quart. Add 
enough cream or milk to make it semi-liquid. Make 
it over-sweet, as it looses by freezing; then freeze like 
ice cream and serve it in the same way.

J^ box gelatine 
Soak the gelatine in some of the milk, then bring the 
milk to a boil in double boiler and add all the ingredi- 
ents except the cream, set it in the coldest place till it 
shows signs of beginning to stiffen; then sweeten and 
whip the cream, stir in quickly and put in a mold on 
ice. Very nice.

Pick over the berries and wash and drain, then 
mash in earthen dish with silver spoon, add the sugar 
and set away for half an hour; then soak the gelatine 
with a little water till dissolved; strain the berries 
through a sieve or colander, add the gelatine to the 
berries, set the dish in a basin of very cold water or a 
pan of pounded ice, stir until it thickens, then, beat in 
the whipped cream; pour into mold and set on ice 
over night is best. Serve with cream. 

Lemon Snow. 

Take one-halfibox of Cox's gelatine, just cover with 
cold water, set it in warm place till dissolved, then 
pour on it one quart of boiling water (in hot weather 
one pint and a half of water); when dissolved add 



The Queen Cook Book 167 

two cups of sugar and the juice of two or three 
lemons; according to size; strain, set away in cold 
water or on ice till it begins to thicken, then add the 
stiffly beaten whites of four eggs, with the dish on ice 
continue to beat for fifteen minutes or until white as 
snow; turn into a mold or on ice. All gelatines are 
firmer to be made over night. Very nice. 



Whipped Cream. 

Allow one quart of thick sweet cream for one dozen 
persons, set in a pan of broken ice until very cold, 
sweeten to taste, and flavor, then beat with a cream 
whisk, take off the top as it stiffens into froth and beat 
again and so on till it is all beaten; one-half pound sugar, 
whites of four eggs. Serve in sherbet glasses. It will 
whisk better if you add a half cup of milk to the thick 
cream. It is very nice served on top of grated cocoa- 
nut. 

Coffee Cream. 

This is an inexpensive dessert. Soak half a box of 
Cox's gelatine in a cup of cold water, till dissolved. 
Wet half of a large coffee cup of Java coffee with cold 
water, then pour on a pint of boiling milk and let 
stand on hot stove for fifteen minutes, add one cup of

The Queen Cook Book 169 

in the well beaten whites of three eggs and flavoring. 
Turn into a mold, wet with cold water; let stand some 
hours in a cold place, over night is better. Serve it 
with cream or a thin custard made of the yolks. 

Floating Island. 

Bring to a boil one quart of new milk, beat stiff the 
whites of four eggs sweetened, take up a large spoon- 
ful at a time, and lay on the hot milk for one minute 
as fast as you can till all is scalded, or put it all on as 
one island, take up with a skimmer, drain and set in 
the cold. Make a custard of the milk, yolks and four 
tablespoons of sugar well beaten, a little salt, as it be- 
gins to thicken take off and strain through coarse 
sieve if it is not smooth. Put it in a cold place, when 
ready to use, place the custard, flavored, in the dish, 
the float on top, dot it with bits of jell. This can be 
made in the forenoon for supper. It needs an open 
pan or spider to cook it in. If you drop it in spoon- 
fuls you can put it in custard or lemonade glasses, 
placing a little jell at the bottom and another on top. 

Baked Custard. 

I quart milk Y^ cup sugar 

4 eggs Flavor to taste, salt 

Heat a quart of milk hot in a double boiler that it 
may not whey when boiled, let it stand till cold. 
Beat the eggs and sugar, stir in with, salt and flavor- 
ing, put it in basin, set in baking pan of water, in 
oven, cover till nearly done then take off and brown. 
When the center is thickened like jelly and shakes it 
is done. Watch it closely, as one minute too long 
will turn to whey, and the least bit of that destroys 
the beauty of the custard. 



I/O The Queen Cook Book 



Boiled Custard. 

Prepare the same as above, using five eggs instead 
of four, and cook in double boiler, taking it off as soon 
as it clings to the spoon, stirring it often; if you wish, 
can put it in custard cups, with a meringue on top and 
jell. 

Orange Custard. 

Soak two cups of baker 'sstale or dried bread, dried in 
oven and grated, in a pint of cold milk. When it is 
soft, beat it smooth, add the grated rind and juice of 
three oranges, and sugar according to the acid of the 
oranges; the beaten yolks of three eggs; then the 
well beaten whites, set the cups in pan of hot water, 
cover till hot and bake till it thickens in middle, be 
careful and take it out before it turns to whey. 

CocoANUT Custard. 

To one pound of freshly grated cocoanut allow one 
quart of scalded milk in double boiler and one heap- 
ing teacup of sugar. Beat well the yolks of six eggs 
and stir in alternately in the milk with the cocoanut 
and sugar. If you like it light colored, use the whites 
instead of yolks, or beat stiff, sweeten and drop on top 
of cups. As soon as it begins to thicken set off of 
stove. 

Chocolate Custard. 

Make one quart of boiled custard, adding four table- 
spoons of grated Baker's chocolate^ take oft the 
minute it thickens, just to boiling point.

Lemon Custard. (May keep three days.) 

Two lemons, the rinds and juice, strained and 
sweetened to taste, beat the yolks of eight eggs till 
very light, stir this all into one pint and a half of 
water that has been boiled, stir it on the fire (adding 
one teaspoon cornstarch), take it off as soon as it be- 
gins to thicken. Can add almond or nectarine flavor- 
ing; put in cups, eat cold. 

Peach Meringue. 

Put on in a double boiler one quart of new milk; 
take out enough of it to wet two tablespoons of corn 
starch; when the milk boils stir in the starch till 
cooked; remove from the fire and- stir in one table- 
spoon sweet butter; let it cool a little and add the 
well beaten yolks of three eggs; beat till light and 
creamy; add one-half cup of sugar. Cover the bot- 
tom of a buttered pudding-dish with two layers of cut 
up ripe peaches; sprinkle sugar enough to sweeten 
and pour the custard on top. Bake in a quick oven 
twenty minutes. When done cover with the well- 
beaten whites sweetened; brown lightly in oven. Eat 
warm with sauce or cold with cream. I think it 
nice cold without baking if it is brought to a boil after 
the yolks are in. 

American Cream for Dessert. 

^ box Cox's gelatine i quart milk 

6 tablespoons sugar 4 eggs 

Soak the gelatine in some of the milk, add it to the 
rest in a double boiler with the well-beaten yolks 
with four tablespoons of the sugar. Put on the stove 



172 , The Queen Cook Book 

and heat again (but not boil); take off the stove, add 
the stiffly beaten whites and the two tablespoons of 
sugar. Flavor with vanilla or lemon and pour in 
molds. 

Fresh-Made Jelly and Whipped Cream. 

2 quarts berries % box gelatine 

2 cups sugar % pint cream 

Take strawberries or raspberries; put in granite 
kettle with just water enough to not quite cover; cook 
till soft, strain through a jelly bag; add the sugar and 
enough boiling water to make the quantity one quart. 
Let it boil up, add the gelatine soaked in half a pint 
of water. Strain and pour in cups. Put the whipped 
cream on top before serving.

Chocolate Blanc Mange. 

I quart milk, salt i }^ squares chocolate

illa. Wet the molds with cold water before filling. 
Serve with cream or whipped cream.

The Queen Cook Book 173 

double boiler. Dissolve the gelatine in half cup of 
cold water. When the cream comes to a scald stir 
in slowly all the ingredients; just let it come to a boil 
stirring constantly. Put it in molds. Stand on ice 
over night. Serve with cream. A plainer but nice 
blanc mange can be made with milk and almond ex- 
tract or vanilla. Put it upon the ice and when about 
to thicken, stir it until it is very smooth; then stir in 
lightly a pint of cream, whipped, and put into a 
mold. I prefer putting it in a glass dish ready for 
the table, as the cream is on top; it is more relishable 
and looks better. 



THE ORANGE. 

How true it is with fruits, as well as metals, that 
the laws which govern supply and demand are quickly 
adjusted. No sooner was it realized that fresh fruits 
and vegetables were as necessary for health as animal 
food, then our most enterprising growers set them- 
selves not only to increase the quantity, but to im- 
prove the varieties and preserve them for the longest 
time possible in their natural state. In the month of 
January, before home grown fruits have become scarce 
and high priced, Florida oranges are at our door, 
cheap enough that all may indulge in some of these 
well tested recipes on the delicious fruit. 

Orange Shortcake. 

1 pint flour 2 tablespoons butter 

2 teaspoons baking-powder J4 teaspoon salt 
I cup milk I egg beaten 

Sift the flour, salt and baking-powder twice, rub the 
butter in flour, mix soft as you can handle, roll out in two 



174 The Queen Cook Book 

cakes long for a long square tin; just butter the under 
one and lay one on top of the other; mark the top one 
with a fork. Stand in a cold place or in ice-box 
fifteen minutes, then bake in hot oven about thirty 
minutes, then take out of oven, let stand three 
minutes, then separate the two layers, butter the two 
insides, as for eating. Before making the cake, peel 
five or six sweet oranges and cut in small pieces 
around the core, taking out the seeds, let stand till 
cake is in the oven, then drain off the juice and sprinkle 
a cup or more of sugar on them; spread between the 
layers and set in oven three to four minutes. Do all 
this quickly and serve immediately. 

Lemon or Orange Sauce. 

If one wishes a sauce for it (I do not), cream a cup 
of sugar and half a cup of butter, or that proportion, 
add the grated rind of one lemon or orange, one beaten' 
egg; beat it well; set the bowl over hot tea kettle, 
where it will become hot, but not boil, beating con- 
stantly. Before serving add the juice that came from 
the oranges, or the juice of a lemon. 

Strawberry Shortcake. 

This is made the same way as the orange shortcake. 
Wash the strawberries, pick them over (all berries 
need washing quickly); put the sugar on them just as 
the cake is done, and half chop them a little with the 
spoon. Some like a layer of strawberries on top of 
cake also. We prefer a dish of berries and sugar for 
each one. Mrs. B, 

Orange Jelly. 

Put one pint of cold water on one-half box of Cox's 
gelatine; soak until dissolved; add two cups of sugar, 



The Queen Cook Book 175 

the juice of one lemon and one orange, strained, one 
pint of boiling water; let come to a boil, set away to 
cool; when it begins to thicken pour it over eight 
oranges sliced by cutting around the core and taking 
out the seeds, and sprinkle well with sugar in dish 
for table; put it in ice-box to harden. Mrs. B, 

Orange Jelly No. 2. 

To half a cup of cold water put half a box of gela- 
tine, set in a warm place till dissolved, then pour over 
it a cup of boiling water. Put half a cup of granulated 
sugar on the board and roll a large lemon in it until 
the oil is extracted from the rind. To a pint of the 
juice of sour oranges add the juice of the lemon, one 
cup of sugar and the half cup flavored with the oil of 
the lemon. Add all to the gelatine; stir well; strain 
into wet molds or a flat dish, and cut it out in small 
blocks when solid. Other ways of serving are to cut 
the oranges in half, take out the fruit carefully, and 
drop the skins in cold water. When the jelly is made 
dry these inside, notch the edges prettily, fill with 
the jelly and set on ice or in a cold place; or the 
oranges may be cut so as to leave half, and a half-inch 
strip over the top for the handle, notching the edges. 
Place the. baskets m a pan of chopped ice, fill with the 
jelly, and put a teaspoon of whipped cream on top of 
the jelly. 

Meringues. 

4 eggs, the whites 9 heaping tablespoons sugar 

Beat the eggs very stiff, add gradually the powdered 
sugar till stiff enough to lie in oblong shape on paper. 
Butter white foolscap paper, lay it on bottom of drip- 
ping pan and drop the mixture on the paper, by table- 



176 f%e Quitn Cook Book 

spoonfuls, allowing two inches between each, they 
must not run together. Flavor with lemon. Bake 
or dry in a slow steady oven to a delicate tinge of 
brown. Place the flat sides together, when dry, with 
sweetened and flavored whipped cream. 

Golden Meringues. 

Made the same way as the previous recipe, only 
using the yolks and the white of one egg. The yolks 
will not beat stiff but they will beat very light. They 
must be stiff enough to drop. 

Almond Maccargons. 

Shell half a pound of soft-shelled almonds, pour 
boilmg water over them until the skins are loose, peel 
and throw into cold water, take out, drain in dry 
towel, pound to a paste in marble or some hard mor- 
tar, put in a dish and gradually add one pound of pul- 
verized sugar, and the whites of three stiffly beaten 
eggs, and two teaspoons of extract of lemon. Mix well 
with a mixed metal spoon (not iron spoon). Wet the 
hands in cold water and make the mixture quickly and 
deftly into balls the size of a small hickory nut, put 
sheets of buttered paper in sheet iron pans, lay the 
balls on the paper two inches apart, wet the hands 
and smooth over the top so they are glossy, set in a 
moderate oven for half to three-fourths of an hour till 
dry. 

Lemon Sauce. 

yi cup sugar i tablespoon butter 

I tablespoon corn starch i pint boiling water 
I lemon, rind and juice i egg, salt 

Beat the egg separately, stir the butter and sugar 
to a cream, boil the water in double boiler, wet the 



The Queen Cook Book 177 

starch in cold water, put it in the boiler and boil ten 
minutes, beating all the time till smooth, now add all 
together, take off the stove, add the rind and strained 
juice of lemon. 

Orange Sauce. 

This is made the same way as the above recipe, 
using the juice, strained, of two oranges, and the grated 
rind of one. 

Hickory Nut Maccaroons. 

These are made the same way as the almond macca- 
roons, taking off what skins you can, chopping the 
meats fine and mashing in mortar. 



CANDY, 



Molasses Candy. 

I cup N. O. molasses i cup brown sugar 

I tablespoon butter i tablespoon vinegar 

When warm, stir the ingredients together, let boil 
till brittle, but do not stir it. Be careful not to burn; 
it must slowly boil. Test it by dropping a little in 
water. When brittle, pour out on a greased platter, 
turn up the edges as it cools, butter your hands and 
work by pulling long lengths until a bright and golden 
color. Butter the fingers when it sticks to them, draw 
it into stick size. When cold, cut it in lengths you 
like, flavor with what you like, or put different kinds 
of nuts in different dishes, chopped fine; stir them in. 



178 The Queen Cook Book 



Candy of Any Flavor. 

35^ pounds best sugar i Y^ pints water 

I teaspoon cream tartar 
Boil for fifteen minutes, test it by dropping a little 
in cold water; if the threads are brittle as you pull it, 
it is done; then flavor differently, or put nuts, choco- 
late, cocoanut, or whatever kind of candy you wish to 
make, by stirring them in, in different dishes. Add 
the cream tartar just before you take it up. 

Ice Cream Candy. 

3 pounds best coffee sugar % pound butter 
I teaspoon cream tartar 2 teaspoons extract lemon 
Add just water enough to melt the sugar. Boil 
without stirring, till it is brittle when dropped in cold 
water; then it is done; add the lemon and cream 
tartar, then pour it into as many buttered plates as 
there are pullers. Pull when partly cold till very white 
and creamy. 



SHERBETS. 

Peach Sherbet, 

I quart peaches chopped i quart, heaping, of sugar, 
fine 4 tablespoons gelatine ^ 

2 quarts water boiled 
Soak the gelatine, then pour the boiling water 
onto the sugar and gelatine, add the peaches and set 
to cool, then pack to freeze, when partly frozen add 
one quart of whipped cream sweetened. Pineap- 
ple can be frozen in the same way. Freeze the same 
as ice cream. Mrs. B. 



The Queen Cook Book 179 



Orange Sherbet. 

Soak one tablespoon of gelatine in cold water. 
Boil one quart of water and one pound of sugar for 
five minutes, then add the gelatine and stir till dis- 
solved. Remove from the fire; as soon as cool set it 
on ice to get ready to freeze, after adding the juice of 
ten oranges and two lemons, when it is all very cold, 
freeze, adding the beaten white of one egg sweetened. 
Freeze the same way as ice cream. 

Pineapple Sherbet. 

- To one quart of grated pineapple add one and one- 
half pounds of sugar, the juice of two lemons and one 
quart of water boiled, dissolve the sugar in hot water, 
stir in the lemon and pineapple, let stand one hour, 
then strain through a sieve. When very cold pour 
into the freezer to freeze, stirring it until stiff. Beat 
the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, add two table- 
spoons of sugar. Stir these in when partly frozen, 
then finish. It will need two large pineapples or three 
small ones. For freezing see freezing ice cream. 

CocoANUT Sherbet., 

Two good sized cocoanuts, save the milk that is in 
them, break in pieces and grate all the meat into a 
deep dish, pour over it two quarts of water and let it 
stand two hours, strain through a jelly bag or sieve; 
to this liquid add the cocoanut milk and three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar; mix well. If not sweet enough 
add more sugar, as freezing always requires more. 



l8o The Queen Cook Book 



Lemon Sherbet. 

5 lemons, the juice i pint sugar 

I quart water i tablespoon gelatine 

Soak the gelatine in a little of the water; boil the 
quart of water and pour onto the gelatine and sugar, 
add the lemon juice, strain, turn into freezer and 
freeze. This is light and creamy. 



ICE CREAMS. 

How TO Freeze Creams and all kinds of Ices. 

The first requisite is to have perfectly sweet cream 
and use only the best nmterials, for it will be tainted 
with the least defect. ^Next get a good freezer, one 
working with a crank.A There are new ones nearly 
every year, or some improvements. . Begin to make 
preparations four hours before you wish to serve it. 
A four-quart freezer will require twelve pounds of ice, 
two quarts and a half of coarse salt, rock salt is the 
best. Put the cut-up ice in a coarse coffee sack, 
pound with a hatchet back till as fine as hickory nuts, 
see that the freezer, is properly set in its own tub, put 
the cover on and tie a double cloth over it, to prevent 
the possibility of any salt getting inside. Place at 
the bottom a layer of ice three inches thick then a 
layer of salt, then ice again, then salt, and so on till 
packed full, with a layer of ice last. ^ Pack very solid 
with a stick. Then remove the cloth and cover care- 
fully (see that there is no salt inside), and pour in the 
cream having just added the well whipped whites, 
leaving two inches for expansion. Replace the cover, 



The Queen Cook Book i8l 

adjust the crank, and soon begin to turn the freezer, 
after fifteen minutes pack the ice down again, drain 
off most of the water by taking out the plug from the 
bottom, put it in again, add more ice and turn again, 
repeating the draining and packing. Turn the crank 
steadily till it turns pretty hard. If all is right it will 
freeze in about thirty minutes. Water ices take 
longer time than creams. When frozen wipe the lid 
of the can, open, take out the cranky remove the 
dasher, scrape it off, take a flat mush stick and scrape 
down from the sides of can, and beat and work 
thoroughly for ten minutes; this makes the cream 
smooth. Put the lid on, cork up the crank hole, drain 
and pack with salt and ice, keeping a cloth on cover 
to protect from salt; covering the top with pure ice; 
then throw a piece of double carpet over it and stand 
in a cold place to ripen. In tasting when the cream 
is first frozen, you taste each ingredient separately, 
but after standing one or two hours, they seem to 
blend and form a pleasant whole. When ready to 
serve dip the can quickly in cold water and wipe it and 
turn out on platter and serve. If you have no freezer 
you can use a tin pail for the can, setting it in a 
bucket or some crock the right size for pail, packing 
into the space between them, very firmly, a mixture 
of one-third salt, to two-thirds pounded ice, or snow in 
winter. Shake the pail back and forth, scrape down 
often. Ice creams can be served in fanciful shapes by 
the use of molds. These you have to buy, and un- 
less you have much use for them, it is cheaper to buy 
the cream, as it can be obtained in almost every city. 
It must be placed in the molds after it is frozen and 
well beaten with the spatula, upon this beating de- 
pends the fineness of the cream. I will give a few 
general directions here, which I will not repeat in the 






lS2 The Queen Cook Book 

recipes for creams. To freeze custards, puddings, 
sherbets, or water ices, follow the same directions. 

If you use. eggs or any thickening always strain. 
Do not handle the ice with your hands but use a skim- 
mer or dish to dip it with, nor think you must freeze 
it in a cold place like a cellar and endanger your 
health and life. * It can be frozen in any comfortable 
place. The more rapid the melting of the ice the 
quicker the cream freezes. Bring your cream to a 
boil and melt the sugar in it while hot, reserve one 
pint of cream for whipping to stir in after it begins to 
freeze; remember to sweeten and flavor it before whip- 
ping. When raw cream is frozen it has a strong taste 
and will never be perfectly smooth or velvety. For 
ices also boil the water and dissolve the sugar, boil 
and skim and set to get very cold, then prepare and 
freeze. Berry flavors are prepared by allowing the 
whole berries to stand awhile with a good allowance 
of sugar. Mash them, strain the juice, add it to the 
.cream. It must be too sweet before freezing. 

To one quart of cream, allow one quart of fruit, 
and one pint of sugar. Before it is quite frozen add 
one pint whipped cream sweetened and flavored. If a 
cream is too rich it will not freeze at all. If too poor 
it will be rough and scaly. A pint of berries or 
peaches cut fine (without the juice) and sweetened 
added to a quart of ice cream, while in process of 
freezing makes a delicious fruit ice cream. Water- 
ices are made from the juices of fruits mixed with 
water, sweetened and frozen the same way as cream, 
only it takes longer time for freezing. They must 
both, cream and water, be very cold before stirring. 



Thi Queen Cook Bo^k it} 



Ice Crkam. Very Nice. No. i. 

2 quarts cream 2 cups sugar, heaping 
4 eggs, the whites 4 teaspoons vanilla 

Scald the cream in double boiler, (saving out one 
pint for whipping) dissolve the sugar in hot cream, set 
where it will get very cold before stirring in the stifily 
beaten whites and whipped cream. Freeze. 

Ice Cream No. 2. 

3 pints cream i pint sugar 

1 quart milk 2 eggs, the whites 

This is a different proportion and good. Flavor 
with lemon extract or vanilla. Follow the directions 
on the previous page for freezing. 

Ice Cream No. 3. 

2 quarts new milk 2 even tablespoons com 

3 quarts fresh cream starch 

3 pounds sugar 
Bring to a boil in double boiler the milk and two 
quarts of the cream; dissolve two pints and a half of 
the sugar in it hot; set it where it will get very cold 
or on ice. Then flavor it and flavor and sweeten the 
other quart of cream with the other half pint of sugar. 
Whip and skim off, having it very cold, with a cream 
whisk, taking it off as fast as it rises, wet the corn 
starch with cold milk very smooth and boil five min- 
utes, stirring all the time. Then strain it. After all 
this is done it is ready for freezing when cold. This 
makes two gallons. For this quantity it will take 
nearly one peck of salt and two pecks of fine ice. 
Please remember that you can divide or double any of 



184 The Queen Cook Book 

these recipes, as your needs may be. Freeze; f •Hew- 
ing directions for freezing. 

Ice Cream, Not So Rich. 

2 quarts new milk 4 eggs beaten separately 

3 teaspoons lemon extract 2 cups sugar 

1 pint whipped cream i pint strawberry juice 
Scald the milk in double boiler, beat the yolks and 

add and scald five minutes, dissolving the sugar in it. 
Let it get very cold, and add the beaten whites and 
cream sweetened and flavored. Prepare the straw- 
berry juice as directed, it gives the cream a pretty 
pink color. Always remember to strain all creams 
that have been boiled. You can leave out the whipped 
cream and strawberry juice, if you wish. 

Frozen Custard. 

2 quarts milk 2 tablespoons vanilla or 
I ^ pounds sugar lemon 

4 eggs 
Boil the milk, taking one cup out to beat in with the 
well beaten yolks. Put in the sugar; boil two min- 
utes, put away to get cold, then add flavoring and the 
well beaten whites. From one pint to a quart of 
whipped cream is a great addition. These must be 
very cold before beating, as they beat stiffer. 

Strawberry Ice Cream. 

It is simply adding one pint of well sweetened juice 
to one quart of ice cream, putting it in cold when 
ready to freeze. 



The Queen Cook Book 185 



Peach Ice Cream. 

Peel and mash six large ripe peaches, put through 
a sieve, for every quart of cream well sweetened. 

Pineapple Ice Cream. 

To one quart of cream, peel, grate or mash one pine- 
apple, with one-half pint of sugar, strain through a 
sieve; add it to a regular ice cream. 

Chocolate Ice Cream. 

To two quarts of regular ice cream add four heap- 
ing tablespoons of Baker's sweet chocolate, stirred 
smooth in a few spoons of hot water and the yolks of 
two eggs, then pour it into your hot milk or cream and 
scald three minutes, set away to cool, and proceed as 
for ice cream. 

Orange Ice Cream. 

To one quart of cream, allow one pint of sugar, " a 
pint is a pound the world around ** is the old adage; 
the grated rind of one lemon and one orange, (only 
the outside, remembering the white is bitter) and the 
juice of six large oranges, after it is cold. After 
scalding the cream put in one-half of the sugar very 
slowly to prevent its curdling. The other half dis- 
solve in orange juice. 

Lemon Ice Cream. 

Grate the rind and strain the juice of two large 
juicy lemons, or three small ones, to one quart of 
cream. Put half a pint of the sugar in hot cream. 



1 86 The Queen Cook Book 

Dissolve the other half in a little water and lemon juice, 
adding it when slightly frozen. Add the juice slowly 
beting carefully. It will not require so much sugar 
if you use lemon extract. The flavor is different. 
All creams are lighter if you add the stiffly beaten 
whites of one or two eggs just before freezing. All 
fruits should be sweetened before mixing with the cold 
creams just before freezing. All creams should be 
frozen two hours before they are needed. 

CocoANUT Ice Cream. 

The same as ice cream No. i, adding nearly one 
pint of finely grated cocoanut to one quart of cream. 

Coffee Ice Cream. 

To one quart prepared cream, put one pint of strong 
coffee (the best Java or Mocha) well settled. It must 
be perfectly clear. One pint of sugar. In using 
fruits or coffee, use no other flavoring. Cook one 
teaspoon of corn starch in boiling coffee. 

Biscuit Glace. 

4 yolks of eggs Y^ pint sugar 

2 quarts whipped cream 
Beat well the yolks of eggs, add the sugar slowly, 
and vanilla to taste; scald three pints of cream in 
double boiler, stir in eggs and sugar, when cold add 
the pint of whipped cream and freeze. When nearly 
frozen, stir well with the spatula, color part of it red (if 
you wish) with confectioners* sugar and put in bottom 
of paper capsules, or individual molds, or paper 
cases, then fill up with the uncolored cream. Pack 
these in ice and salt putting ice only on and near the

top. It must be frozen smooth before putting it in 
these biscuit molds. Let freeze two hours. 

French Cook. 



WATER ICES. 

It takes a little longer time to freeze water ices 
than creams. Stir the crank for five minutes then let 
it rest five minutes, for four or five times, then freeze 
the same as for creams. Whatever the desired quan- 
tity make a syrup of the proportion of one pint of 
water to one pint of sugar, and boil for fifteen minutes, 
skimming it as soon as the skum rises, then set away 
to get cold. Add the lemon juice or whatever fruit 
is desired, adding the whites of three eggs, stiflfly 
beaten, to every two quarts of the mixture, stirring 
them in when partly frozen. 

Lemon Ice. 

3 quarts water 3 quarts sugar 

18 lemons 6 eggs, the whites 

Strain through a fine sieve. Follow directions for 
freezing as above and for ice cream. Or make a very 
strong lemonade and very sweet, the juice of five 
lemons, strained, to one quart of water. When it 
begins to freeze stir in the six beaten whites of eggs. 

Mrs. B. 
• 

Pineapple Ice. 

1 pint water i pmt sugar 

2 ripe pineapples 5 eggs, the whites. 
Prepare the syrup as directed; beat the whites of 

two of the eggs stiff, stir it in to clarify the syrup, 



I88 The Queen Cook Book 

skimming as fast as it rises; boil fifteen minutes; let 
it get very cold. Peel and grate the pineapple, strain 
through a sieve. To one quart of the syrup add the 
juice of one lemon and stir in the pineapple; when 
very cold freeze as directed. When about half frozen 
beat in the whites of three stiffly beaten eggs, adding 
four tablespoons of powdered sugar in eggs. Freeze. 

Cherry Water Ice. 

Prepare the same as the above recipe, allowing one 
pint of mashed pitted cherries to one quart of syrup, 
adding one cup of sugar to cherries and rub through a 
sieve. F reeze the same as other ices. 

Coffee Ice* 

One pint of strong coffee (perfectly clear), one pint 
of water, one pint of sugar. Prepared as other ices 
and frozen the same way* 

Orange Ice. 

Peel and cut up eight large oranges; put on one cup 
sugar; let stand an hour, squeeze them well and strain 
through a sieve, add the juice of two lemons; add all 
to one quart of the prepared syrup, as heretofore 
stated, and the whites of three stiffly beaten eggs 
when partly frozen, then freeze. 

Currant and Grape Ice. 

These are made the same as other fruits; allowing 
one pint of the juice to one quart of the syrup. With 
all these fruits be sure they are sweet enough, as the 
acids vary. 



The Queen Cook Book 1 89 



TuTTi Frutti. 

When a rich vanilla cream is partly frozen, candied 
cherries, chopped raisins, citron or any other candied 
fruit chopped fine are added; add about half the quan- 
tity of fruit that there is of ice cream. Freeze in 
molds or not. 



CAKE. 

Cake Mixing. 

There is a best way of doing everything, even to 
boil an egg, to cook it so as to be palatable and 
nourishing. So there must be a best way to go to 
work to make a cake. How very difficult it seems to 
a beginner, while to one of experience it is very simple 
and a delight. Knowledge gives us power in all 
things. A clean calico dress and apron is the first 
necessary thing when one is goin^ to work with flour. 
The next is to get every thing ready to work with, on 
the clean kitchen table. Line the baking pans with best 
wrapping paper. Turn the cake pan bottom side up 
and cut two papers the size of the bottom, butter the 
top one by warming the pan, then put the dry one 
under the other; for the sides shape the paper inside 
to the pan and then crease it and cut it the depth of 
pan and butter them. Cake baking pans should have 
a tube in the center, it bakes more even, but do not 
forget to butter it. Now get all the ingredients to- 
gether, and be very exact in all your measurements. 
For a cupful of flour, sugar or butter, run a knife 
straight across the top of cup; this is even full for a 
cup or tablespoon. Roll the sugar (using the pow- 



190 The Queen Cook Book 

dered for nice cake, the granulated is too coarse a 
grain), and measure the butter you need; in cold 
weather let the butter stand long enough to soften so 
as to cut easily, but if it melts at all, it will make the 
cake heavy or soggy. Sift and measure the flour, 
then sift the second time, after you have stirred the 
baking-powder in it. In hot weather lay the eggs 
for one-half hour in very cold water as they 
will beat lighter. This should be the first thing 
to do. I always take for all kinds of cake^ just 
half as much butter as sugar, except fried cakes. 
This gives the best grain to the cake. For fruit 
cake, seed the raisins, clean, wash and dry the 
currants the day before. Sprinkle two tablespoons 
of flour on every pound of raisins after slightly 
chopping them, using the dryest and best 
brown sugar. Add the raisins after the flour and milk 
is stirred in. Stir the cake in an earthen dish (never 
in tin) with a wooden spoon. In cold weather warm 
the dish by letting warm water stand in the dish till 
warmed through, not hot enough to melt the butter. 
First put the rolled sugar in the dish, then in the cen- 
ter put the cut up butter and stir to a perfectly light 
cream. This is best for all cakes, even cookies or 
or fried cakes are more delicate. Always beat the 
yolks and whites separately on a flat plate or platter 
with a steel knife, using it deftly by slightly lifting it 
and not stirring, to give it a light foam. I have pur- 
chased several egg beaters and tried two of our own 
invention, but have discarded them all and gone back 
to the steel kitchen knife; the eggs are much lighter. 
Stir the well-beaten yolks in next till very light color, 
then the whites, then the flour and milk, about one- 
fourth at a time gradually, till all is in, adding the 
flavoring. Do not leave the cake after you once bq;ui 



The Queen Cook Book 191 

to mix it; always stir the same way and put right in a 
moderate oven that you can hold your hand in to count 
thirty. It must be heated through to the center ere it 
bakes, so as to rise even; the heat must not decrease, 
or it will fall, but be kept a steady heat. It must rise 
fully before a crust is formed. If the cake browns too 
fast cover it with brown paper, and open one of the 
oven dampers for a short time. As much depends on 
the heat of the oven and your intelligent management 
of it as in mixing. Count the number of minutes it 
takes to bake bread, for cake a little less. When the 
cake rises and cracks open you may be sure there is 
too much flour. Some flours swell more than others. 
Open the oven door as little as possible and close it 
quickly, do not turn it round till it is set in center. 
There are three simple tests to tell when cake is done. 
It will cleave from the pan around the edges; will not 
stick to a broom corn run into the center of cake; and 
put your ear to the cake and if you hear it tick or sing 
loudly it is not done; return it to the oven; if very 
faintly it may be done. Do not take out of pan till 
half cooled, then put it on the flat bottom of a larger 
cake pan and frost if you wish to Remember to use 
only good, fresh eggs and perfectly sweet butter. It is 
well to weigh and measure one pound each of flour, 
sugar and butter "and get cups that twice even full of 
sugar will be one pound and four times even full of 
flour will be one pound, and once full and one-third or 
more one pound of butter. Do not allow these cups 
to be used for any other purpose, and they are always 
ready. It is more convenient than weighing. I shall 
give my recipes by measure as far as possible. I do 
not wish to enlarge the book by repeating how to mix 
every recipe. I will give it in more condensed form. 
Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, then beat the 



192 The Queen Cook Book 

yolks well and stir in; beat the whites to a stiff froth 
and stir in; next the flour with baking powder and milk, 
a part of each gradually, and flavoring. All cakes are 
mixed this way, except when otherwise mentioned. 
If the inexperienced will read all these directions they 
will be thoroughly equipped to make a cake. 

Fruit Cake. 

2 cups sugar 4 cups flour 
I cup butter lo eggs 

I pound raisins 2 pounds currants 

J^ pound citron 2 even teaspoons cloves 

I cup brandy 2 even teaspoons cinnamon 

Prepare the raisins, currants, and slice the citron 
very thin the day beforehand, and follow the direc- 
tions for mixing cake. Remember the former direc- 
tions, to rub the dried or Zante currants first in a crash 
towel to break off the little stems, and they are some- 
times very dirty; wash in two or three waters, press 
the water out between two dry towels and dry them 
over night by the stove. You can leave the currants 
and citron out of any cake you wish, and some like it 
better without either. I am certain the cake is more 
healthy without and more relishable. A slow oven 
for all cakes with fruit or molasses in them.

one cup of molasses, one cup chopped raisins, one 
teaspoon each of cinnamon and cloves, one tablespoon 
of brandy, one-half cup of flour. Bake in one layer 
and put between the other two white layers. Frost 
each layer.

a baking pan, then a layer of thin sliced citron dredged 
with flour, then another layer of batter, then of citron, 
and so on until all is in, this being an excellent way of 
putting in the citron; finish with a layer of the cake 
batter, and bake forty-five minutes or more.

This is a delicious cake, and when cut is very dis- 
tinguished looking. Will keep a long time. 

These two last recipes will make two medium-sized 
cakes, that is, two three-quart pans, or one five-quart. 
For fruit cake it bakes more even with a tube in the 
center of the pan.

possible; bake twenty minutes in a moderate steady 
heat. 

Angel's Food. 

J^ pint flour i even teaspoon cornstarch

I ^ cups powdered sugar tartar 

I I eggs I teaspoon flavoring 

Sift the flour; corn starch, and cream of tartar 
together five times; put the water and sugar in a 
granite basin on the stove; stir well together, let it 
simmer slowly while you beat the eggs to a stiff froth 
after you sprinkle on them one-half teaspoon of salt. 
Boil the syrup until it will thread, and pour it slowly 
over the beaten eggs; beat all briskly until the mixture 
is light and cool; then sift the flour over it a little at 
a time, and stir it gently until all the flour is in and 
no lumps, stir in the flavoring, and pour the batter 
into a three-quart pan with a tube in the center; bake 
in a moderate oven about forty minutes. Stick a 
straw into the cake, if it comes out clean, the cake is 
done. Turn the pan upside down and let it rest on 
the table until the cake is nearly cold, then remove it 
from the pan, and place it bottom up, on a larger cake 
pan. Cover with boiled icing. 

N. B. — In making the angel's food, the beating 
and mixing must all be done with a wire spoon egg 
beater (not a Dover). The eggs niust be very cold. 
Grease the pan very slightly — do not use a piece of 
butter larger than a pea; do not cut this cake until it 
is ten or twelve hours old. Better when two days 
old. Saw the cake with the knife when cutting it.

ICINGS. 

Icing for Cakes. 

The whites of three large eggs beaten so stiff they 
will not slide or drop from knife, sift in through a piece 
of lace or fine sieve two cups of powdered sugar, sift- 
ing and beating in gradually, till you can spread it on 
cake and not run. This will frost two cakes top and 
sides. Flavor with one teaspoon of lemon extract or 
a half teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Rule for Frosting. 

For the white of one egg, one cup of sifted sugar. 
Beat the egg stiff and gradually add the sugar, beating 
till light and not thin enough to run when you spread 
it. Flavor or not as you like. This is the propor- 
tion. For boiled icing, I refer you to the icing under 
the head of mountain cake and ice cream cake. 

Boiled Icing. 

Boil until it will thread one and one-half cups of 
sugar, one tablespoon of vinegar, and one tablespoon 
of water; pour the boiled sugar into the whites of two 
stiffly beaten eggs, beat well; when cool spread. After 
a little experience in nice cake making and frosting, 
one needs to be* guided by their own judgment as 
regards the stiffness of cake or icings; as eggs vary in 
size and flour in thickening qualities. Be particular 
to use the same sized cup for all measures of the same 
cake.

the flour, then the well beaten eggs, milk, spices and 
the rest of flour. Be careful not to burn it or bake

hot water. Let both settle and pour off carefully 
(leaving the sediment at the bottom) into the molasses

and pour all quite warm on to the butter. Sift on the 
ginger, ammonia and a teaspoon of salt; work and 
mix it with the hands. Mix it soft, as you can roll it 
easily and nicely three-fourths of an inch thick, and 
bake on long square tins. Make it up without delay 
and put it in oven immediately, as anything with 
soda or saleratus loses its rising qualities. Bake in 
moderate oven, as molasses burns easily. This is the 
old-fashioned gingerbread^ such as our grandmothers 
used to make on training days after the revolutionary 
war and was called Trainers' Gingerbread.

CANNING FRUITS. 

The four months from the time of strawberries in 
June, till October, is the harvest time for fruits for 
every housekeeper, as well as for the industrious 
farmer, to go earnestly into the work of securing the 
winter and spring supplies of relishes, preserves, canned 
fruits, pickles and condiments of various kinds. To 
an ambitious housekeeper it is a genuine pleasure and 
satisfaction, that she may be fully equipped to supply 
the needs of those who are depending upon her for 
much that goes to make life a pleasure. We should 
not be content until we have become familiar with 
caring for fruits as well as cake-making; though not 
as essential as a good bread-maker and cook of meats 
and vegetables. She will be constantly gathering new 
ideas and making improvements. Let us try and not 
make too hard work of this extra annual labor; but 
make bur plans for it before hand, thinking of all the 
materials we will need to purchase for the fruit that 
is to be cared for in the coming weeks, such as sugar. 



The Qui en Cook Book 21 3 

sfnees, cans, covers and rubbers. More vin^far, etc. 
We do not need to can as many fruits as formerly, as 
we can obtain fine oranges in the early spring, which 
are a very pleasant change. 

The lack of having things in readiness only goes to 
annoy and tire the one who is hoping to make a suc- 
cess of it. 

Select your fruit carefully yourself; reject all that is 
imperfect. Wash and '^ipe it dry with a crash towel. 
Strawberries, raspberries and blackberries, wash in 
very cold water quickly and drain through a colander 
or sieve. Some years raspberries have a small white 
worm inside, the water brings them out, but take 
them to a bright light when washing. For canning 
only cook enough for three or four quarts at a time, 
as it breaks the fruit. The best way to test the cov- 
ers of cans is to fill the cans with water the day before 
you wish to use them and screw tight with good new 
rubbers the same as for canned fruit, and lay them on 
the side over night. When you put the rubber on the 
Mason jar run the thumb all around the inner edge to 
make sure it is pressed down and neither too large or 
too tight. If they do not leak water you may be sure 
they are good. Put a breakfast plate in the bottom of 
a kettle, fill it half full of water, fill three or four cans 
two-thirds full of water and set in on the plate, to keep 
from breaking them. Let these get boiling hot while 
you are heating the fruit. Another way is to wrap a 
cold wet cloth twice around and under the bottom of 
can while filling can, excluding the air from the out- 
side it will not break; put in funnel and fill gradually 
with boiling hot fruit, run the handle of a silver spoon 
next to the inside of can to let out any air bubbles, fill 
full, let stand ten minutes as it will settle some; screw 
tight as possible; when cold tighten the cover again, 



214 T^f^^ Queen Cook Book 

let lie over night on their side, if they do not leak they 
are probably all right, and ready to put in a dark, cool 
place. You can try them anjd see if they are tight. 
In one week examine them closely. If any are fer- 
mented take off the top of them, and scald and recan 
and use up soon. Some set the can on a cold wet cloth 
and put a silver tablespoon inside, letting the handle 
run up into the funnel, and fill with hot fruit as others. 
The fruit should be perfectly fresh and nearly ripe 
enough to eat by hand. All berries should be canned 
the day they are picked, and so should peaches. Pears 
should be picked as soon as seeds are more than half 
turned dark, put in boxes in cellar and covered with 
matting or old carpet, till they are nearly fit for eating. 
This is the only way they have a rich flavor; they 
never get it on the tree. Look them over every day 
after the first three days. Quinces should not be 
picked till in October and turning somewhat yellow. 
They can stand a few days. The rubber rings should 
have an even edge all around, when the cover is 
screwed on, for if it slips up (drawn in) or swells out, 
air is admitted. Be sure the glass cans, covers and 
rubbers are perfectly clean when put up. Keep your 
rubbers on a ribbon roller, to keep in shape. If not 
kept in shape, they will not probably be air-tight 
again. Wash all the syrup off of jars, before putting 
them away after filling. 

New glass cans often contain fine bits of glass; they 
should be washed well with hot soap suds and use a 
swab. 

Canned Apples. 

Take tart late fall apples, wash and wipe clean. 
Peel and quarter, or if large cut in six or eight pieces. 
Allow one cup of sugar for each pound of apples after 



The Queen Cook Book 3i$ 

they are cored; wash them again that the syrup may 
be clear. After weighing the apples keep them 
covered from the air (as it turns them dark) till you 
have made a syrup of the sugar and one quart of 
water or more according to quantity of fruit. Boil 
and skim. If the sugar is specky strain it, and then 
put in apples enough for four quarts at a time, let get 
hot slowly, as soon as tender, can them as directed in 
canning. Do not can them till cold weather as they 
will keep better. A nice way is to mix a few quinces 
with the apples, by partly cooking the quinces first. 
To two quarts of apples put one quart quinces, they 
require more sugar than apples. Never cook nor eat 
what seenis to be the sound part of decayed fruit of 
any kind; its very breath is tainted. The Duchess 
and Maiden Blush are superior for cooking. Always 
use a porcelain-lined or granite kettle for cooking all 
kinds of fruits and pickles. Apple preserves are made 
the same way, only, three-fourths pound of sugar to 
one of apples. 

Canned Peaches. 

Select fruit just ripe, but not soft, the late Crawford 
is the best, though there is a very rich white peach if 
you can obtain it. Peel and cut in halves, take out 
the pit, cover them with a paper, as they turn dark in 
the atmosphere; (have a wet cloth in your dish, to 
wipe knife and fingers on often for paring all fruits). 
Rinse quickly in water and drain. One cup of sugar to 
two quarts of peaches, or as you like it. Prepare the 
syrup as for apples. Do not boil as they will boil to 
pieces, but keep them boiling hot and press down dip- 
ping the syrup on top. Do not stir fruit that you wish 
tQ keep whole. When clear or boiling hot can them. 



2i6 The Queen Cook Book 

If you wish them rich as preserves put one cup and a 
half of sugar to one pound of peaches. 

Pears. 

Pears should be pared and halved and cored, not 
only taking out the seeds, but all the core to the stem; 
keep them covered, rinse in cold water, drain, make 
the syrup, skim and strain if necessary, they require 
much less sugar than peaches, and require to be 
cooked twice as long or more, till they can be pierced 
easily, with fork. Some like sliced lemon in them. 
A little green ginger root added to the syrup gives a 
very pleasant flavor, as pears are quite tasteless. 

Plums. 

To can plums allow one-half pound of sugar (or a 
coffee cup) to one pound of fruit; wash and pick of! 
the stems; prick each end of the plums quite through 
with a darning needle, put in a stone jar; make the 
syrup, putting as little water as possible to melt the 
sugar, for the plums are very juicy. Put one cup of 
water in the kettle with what sugar it will melt slowly 
and then keep adding till all is melted, boiled and 
skimmed, then pour it boiling hot over the plums. 
Put a nice clean plate on them, to keep tlie plums 
under the syrup, and let stand until the next day; 
pour the syrup from the plums and let boil again, 
pouring it on the plums, repeat this process three 
days; then put the syrup over the fire, and when it 
comes to a boil add the plums, and cook slowly fifteen 
minutes, then fill your cans and seal. The object of 
scalding them so many times is to prevent them from 
breaking to pieces. This is good for all kinds of 
plums. Plum preserves are mad^ the same way, using 



The Queen Cook Book 217 

pound for pound, or some will only require three- 
tourths of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 



Plum Marmalade. 

Pour boiling water over the plums to take the skins 
off easily; take off the skins, take out the pits, then 
weigh; if sour use pound for pound, if not, three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. To make the 
syrup add as little water as possible to melt it, then 
put in the fruit and cook till smooth, say thirty min- 
utes, if not smooth put it through a sieve; put it in 
cups or small jars. 

Quinces. 

Quinces should be thoroughly ripe and one meets 
with the best success when they are of a bright golden 
yellow. There are two or three kinds of quinces, 
some cook to pieces in the syrup, not bearing much 
boiling; other kinds require cooking soft in water first. 

I use what is called the lemon quince and I find it 
cooks tender in the syrup. If it turns red you have 
cooked it too long. Can them as soon as tender. 
Wash the fruit and rub with a dry cloth, pare and cut 
in eight pieces, and cut out all the white core, as it 
will turn dark. Keep covered while paring and wash, 
to take off all specks. In making the syrup allow one- 
half pound of sugar to one of fruit and hardly water 
enough to cover, when cold put in the fruit, cook 
slowly till tender (not red) and can. A tea saucer is 
the best to dip all fruit into the funnel. For preserves 
use three-fourths of a pound of sugar, to a pound of 
fruit and can air tight. 



il8 The Queen Cook Book 

Strawberries. 

Take fresh picked berries, wash quickly in very cold 
water, hull and pick over carefully; one coffee cup of 
sugar to one quart of berries or richer if you like. 
There are two ways of canning them, one is, put one- 
half a cup of water into a porcelain kettle, put in the 
sugar then the berries on top and stand on back of 
stove. Let stand till the juice moistens the sugar; 
put it over a slow fire till all the sugar is melted, then 
gradually increase the heat till the berries are heated 
through, say to the boiling point, and can. Do not 
be too long about it, or let them be on the fire too 
long, as they will loose their beautiful color and turn 
white. Another way which I have never tried, but is 
recommended by good authority is, to fill the can 
with the fruit, fill, up with the syrup, put on cover 
without rubber, set the cans in an old boiler with rack 
under them, have the cold water not reach the top of 
can by two inches, then let come to a boil, fifteen 
minutes boiling is usually enough; the berries must be 
boiling hot through, then fill full, put on rubbers and 
screw on covers. This is the most difficult fruit to 
keep, as it is very acid and comes in the hottest 
weather. 

Strawberry Preserves. 

Prepare them in the same way, taking a pound of 
sugar for a pound of fruit, only as soon as the fruit is 
boiling hot through skim it out into can (the propor- 
tion), and boil the syrup with cover off twenty or 
thirty minutes; then make the cans air tight. 

Raspberries: 

These are canned and preserved the same way af 
strawberries. 



The Omen Cook Book 219 



Pineapples. 

The sugarloaf is one of the sweetest and best pine- 
apples for preserving. The season for this is at its 
height about the last of June or 4th of July, when 
these delicious fruits may, when plenty, often be pur- 
chased for $1 a dozen. The best come from Havana. 
In June the choice Ripley and the Queen Anne are 
choice varieties and come from Jamaica. They are ex- 
ceedingly rich in flavor and sweet. These fancy pines 
are quite small, selling on an average at 30 cents 
apiece. These are considered superior to any other 
variety for table use because of their rich flavor. 
The most delicious way of preserving a pineapple is 
in its own juice without using one drop ci water. 
Peel the pineapples carefully after, cutting them in 
slices one-half an inch thick cut out all the eyes and 
allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of pineapple. Put a small layer of sugar in 
the bottom of a stone crock, then a layer of pineap- 
ple and a layer of sugar and one of fruit, and so on 
till all is used; cover them tight after putting a press- 
ure on them and let stand twenty-four hours. A clear 
juice will nearly cover them then. Now take each 
slice and tear the pulp in pieces off the core, using a 
silver fork. Drain off all the juice from the pulp and 
also the juice and sugar out of the dish; put this 
juice and sugar in granite kettle. Let it come slowly 
to boiling point; skim and boil for five minutes, then 
strain through a fine sieve or sheer cloth over the 
pulp. Let the pulp boil up in the syrup once, then 
can it immediately, as longer boiling darkens the fruit. 
If you wish use the whites of two eggs beaten up to 
clarify the syrup. 



aao The Queen Cook Book 



Serving Pineapple. 

A nice dessert for dinner or a tea dish, is to slice it 
the same as the above, cover with sugar in layers, let 
stand for two hours. Then tear the fruit from the 
core with a silver fork. Preserved pineapple is espe- 
cially fine served with whipped cream. A pineapple 
Bavarian cream is one of the best desserts we have, 
and there is no better water ice or sherbet. But do 
not buy the coarse-grained, flavorless early fruit. 

Canning Tomatoes. 

Scald, peel and slice the tomatoes as for cooking 
for table, rejecting the cores and every one that is im- 
perfect. One teaspoon salt to every peck; put over 
to cook one-half hour or more stirring very often, till 
it is fine, then can hot and seal tight. 

Preserved Citron Melon. 

Pare, core and cut the melons into slices; cut up 
the slices an inch and a half long. Weigh them, and 
to every six pounds of fruit put six pounds of granu- 
lated sugar, the juice and yellow rind — pared off thin 
— of four lemons; also half a pound of race ginger; 
put the slices into a granite kettle, cover with water 
and a layer on all of peach leaves; boil about half an 
hour, or until clear, and a broom-corn will easily 
pierce them; drain them, spread them in a pan of 
cold water, and let them stand all night; next morn- 
ing tie the ginger in a thin muslin cloth and boil it in 
three pints of water until the water is highly flavored; 
take out the ginger; dissolve the sugar in the ginger- 
Water, put in the lemon peel and boil and skim it till 



The Queen Cook Book 221 

no more scum rises; take out the lemon peel, put in 
the citron slices and juice of lemon, and boil in the 
syrup till the slices are transparent and a straw will 
go through them; put the slices, while warm, in jars, 
and pour the syrup on slowly; seal in air tight cans. 

Home Messenger, 

Cranberry Sauce, Jam and Jelly. 

Pick out all the soft berries and stems, wash and 
put over to stew with water epough to come to the 
top. To every quart of berries put one pint of sugar, 
stew till tender and thoroughly cooked, either to a jell 
or with a syrup, as you like. The jell is made the 
same as currant jell, and the jam or marmalade the 
same as plum marmalade. 

Prunes (Stewed). 

Wash thoroughly in two waters, put in stew kettle 
with water enough to cover, to one quart of prunes 
put two tablespoons of sugar, be very careful not to 
get them too sweet, as the flavor of good ones de- 
pends upon the proportion of sugar and fruit. Let 
steep on back of stove till tender, perhaps two hours 
or more. Do not buy cheap ones, they are insipid. 

Apple Sauce. 

This is a favorite dish to be eaten with fresh pork, 
roast pig, goose and duck. Use Rhode Island green- 
ings or any sour, juicy apple; wash and wipe clean. 
Pare, quarter and core, put in granite kettle, with 
water to cover well, cook till nearly tender then add 
sugar according to the acidity of apple. If you wish 
marmalade add a little more sugar and rub through a 
sieve. Some like a teaspoon of butter stirred in. 



Tie Qiuin Cook Book 



JELLIES. 

Jelly making requires skill and care; only the best 
quality of fruit and best coffee sugar should be used. 
It must not be cooked too long as it makes it ropy, 
strong and dark-colored. The same rules must be 
observed for all jellies. I will give a perfect one for 
currant jelly and all others are made the same way, 
such as strawberries and grapes. Try to obtain the 
fruits when they are just ripe — not too ripe, for then 
they are liable to be watery and the jelly qualities 
destroyed to a greater or less extent. 

Currant Jelly. 

Have the currants picked as clean as possible from 
leaves, pick them over but not off the stems, pick out 
all that are dried or green; wash and drain well, then 
squeeze a few at a time with the hands, in a large 
bowl, and put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, when 
all are in, put it on a slow fire, stirring often, let come 
to a boil for twenty minutes; then strain through a 
coarse three-cornered cloth strainer. Wash out the 
kettle. Let the strainer hang and drip for an hour, 
(let them cool before you fill the strainer), then 
squeeze lightly only. Measure the number of pints of 
juice ; allow one pound of best coffee sugar to each pint of 
juice; set the sugar on platters in moderate oven to 
get quite hot, while the juice is boiling twenty-five 
minutes; skim the scum off as soon as it rises, then 
have a strong fire, and slowly stir in the hot sugar, 
which will take five minutes. Jelly will form one side 
of spoon and kettle while the stirring is going on, let 
it just come to a boil, wrap a cold wet cloth around 
the glasses and fill with a cup, if it is right the cold 



The Queen Cook Book 2^3 

cup\will be loaded with jelly. Such juicy fruits as 
currants, grapes and strawberries require no water to 
make jelly. Pulpy fruits, such as peaches, apples and 
quinces, should be cut up small, after being pared and 
cored, and just water enough to come to the top of 
fruit in the stew kettle. Boil slowly, keep covered, 
stir often, till tender and no more, then strain, (with- 
out much squeezing) measure and allow one pound of 
sugar for every pint of juice, and proceed the same as 
with currant jelly. A friend, who is always success- 
ful in her jellies, says the juice for jelhes must never 
be squeezed through the jelly-bag;, and also that she 
always cooks the strained juice twenty minutes with- 
out the sugar, after it Is measured, but has the sugar 
on platters in the oven, carefully stirring it occa- 
sionally, and watching that it does not get too hot so 
as to brown. Then she stirs the hot sugar into the 
juice, and lets it boil up just once; then takes it from 
the fire immediately. Her jelly always " sets." 

Lemon Jelly. 

I oz. gelatine 3 cups sugar 

3 lemons 2 oranges, the juice 

Wet the gelatine with a little cold water, when 
partly dissolved pour on one quart of boiling water; 
add the juice of lemons and oranges and sugar, then 
strain and pour ip molds, set on ice. Make it the day 
before using it. 

Wine Jelly. 

To a package of Cox's gelatine put one pint of cold 
water, put in a warm place for a while to dissolve, 
then add one quart of boiling water, the juice of three 
lemoBSy three cups of sugar, one pint of wine. Bring 



1^4 ^^^ Queen Cook Book 

to a boil, strain and put in molds. If it is cold 
weather, or stands over night, one pint more of water 
can be added and it will come to a jelly easily. This 
makes nearly three quarts. 

Charlotte Russe. 

To one ounce of Cox*s gelatine, put one cup of 
warm milk, keep warm till dissolved, then add one 
cup sugar; strain, add a little salt, flavor with lemon, 
extract or vanilla. Flavor and sweeten one quart of 
cream. Whip it, and add it to cold gelatine. One 
can put it in dish and serve when cold as it is with 
cake, or line the dish with sponge cake and pour it in 
when it begins to stiffen. This must be eaten the day 
it is made. 

Charlotte Russe. 

The day before wanted make a stiff plain jelly of 
calves' feet, or you may use Cox's gelatine, but the feet 
are best; put four calves' feet in a gallon of water and 
boil slowly until the meat drops from the bones and the 
water is reduced to less than two quarts; strain, and 
let stand over night in a cool place; in the morning 
scrape off all the fat, then turn it out, scrape off all 
the sediment from the bottom; have just three pints. 
Boil one pint of milk, flavor it highly with vanilla, let 
get cold. Take three pints of rich cream, put it in a 
shallow pan, set on ice and whip it with whisk, 
skimming it off as fast as it rises; then add ftie vanilla 
milk to the cream, and beat both together; melt the 
jelly by setting it over the fire. Beat very light the 
yolks of six eggs, beating in one cup of sugar; add by 
degrees the melted jelly to the sugar and eggs, stirring 
very hard; keep the vessel setting on ice and continus 



The Queen Cook Book 225 

stirring till the mixture is firm enough to retain the 
mark of the spoon; then stir in the whipped cream as 
quickly as possible; have ready your dish for table, 
lined with sponge cake and pour in the, charlotte. Put 
ice around it in refrigerator. It will be ready to serve 
in two hours. Some prefer it without the sponge 
cake and eat it with cream and cake. For cleaning 
feet, see souse. 

Calves* Foot Jelly. 

Clean well, and cut off the toes of a calf *s feet, put 
the feet into a gallon of water, boil till reduced one- 
half, then strain, let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing take off all the fat, remove the sediment, and put 
the clear part over the fire, the strained juice of three 
lemons, two cups sugar, a blade of mace, a stick of 
cinnamon, the beaten whites of three eggs. Boil fif- 
teen minutes, strain, ^nd if not clear strain again 
through a jelly bag. The bag should always be wrung 
out of hot water before using, and the jelly should 
always run through of itself, never squeeze it, as it 
makes the jelly muddy. This jelly is amber color. 
Half of it may be colored red and a little at a time put 
into glasses, as it begins to set, then the amber, then 
the red, and so on till the glass is full. This makes a 
very showy, as well as palatable dessert; can cover 
the top with frosting of whites of sweetened beaten 
eggs. This is the old English way. 

Neapolitan Blanc Mange. 

Measure three pints of milk, put one pint in the 
double rice boiler, mix two and a half even table- 
spoons of corn starch with cold milk, make it smooth. 
When the milk is hot, before it scalds^ stir in the 



226 The Queen Cook Book 

starch, with two large spoons of sugar and a pinch of 
salt, stir all the time until smooth and as thick as cus- 
tard, remove from the fire and add one-fourth tea- 
spoon of rose extract and enough cochineal extract 
(which you can find at the druggist's) to color it pink. 
Put it in a mold or dish that will hold three or more 
pints. Wash the "boiler and put in another pint of 
milk and proceed as before. When the pink is cold, 
pour this (flavored with lemon extract) over it and set 
away to cool; when the kettle is washed and you cook 
the last pint of milk the same way. Grate two tea- 
spoons of chocolate in a cup and set in a dish of hot 
water to melt. When the blanc mange is smooth, 
add chocolate and half a teaspoon of vanilla, cool a 
little, and when the other is solid pour this over it, 
and set in cool place till next day. Serve with sweet- 
ened whipped cream for dessert. 

Pure Grape Wine for the Sick. 

I give this recipe as a safe preparation of wine to 
be used when necessary, in cases of great prostration. 
It may prove of value where a pure wine is needed. 
Pick the grapes when ripe and sweet, remove all that 
are green, imperfect or broken, pick from the stem, 
wash thoroughly by hand, drain them, then mash by 
squeezing a few at a time in a large earthen bowl; 
then put them in a sweet earthen vessel (say four-gal- 
lon jars) and let stand two or three days, or until the 
skins rise and form a scum and the first fermentation 
begins to stop. Then strain through a wet and some- 
what sheer cloth strainer; do not squeeze too close, as 
there will be too much sediment; add to the juice as 
much of best brown sugar as required to make it 
(when dissolved), bear an egg above tb^ lurface, the 



TAe Queen Cook Book ttj 

size of a two shilling piece. Pour off carefully into a 
good clean cask or beer keg, that you can fill full and 
have two gallons over to fill up with every day as it 
runs over. Leave the bung out, and keep the cask so 
full that the scum may run over until the fermenta- 
tion begins to stop, which will be in eight or ten days. 
Then stop it up very tight and keep in a good cool 
cellar for three months, when it will be fit for use, but 
will improve with age, whether bottled or kept on the 
lees. Three bushels of grapes will make five gallons 
of wine. 

" A minister in New York," says the Chicago Inter 
Ocean, " visited a number of the best liquor stores 
in his neighborhood and bought pint samples of their 
gin, whisky, port wine, etc. In the analysis of the 
'Pure Holland Gin* were found neutral spirits, rotten 
corn, juniper berries, turpentine and vitrol. The fine 
old hand-made Kentucky whisky contained neutral 
spirits, glycerine, sulphate of zinc, chromic acid, creo- 
sote, unslacked lime and fusil oil, and the rare old 
port had licorice, zinc, mercury, antimony, muriatic 
acid and alum. The result of this analysis is sufficient 
apology for my recipe of ' Pure Grape Wine for the 
sick.'" 

Baked Quinces. 

Wash and wipe clean, take out the cores from the 
blossom end with a tin apple corer, fill with sugar, 
bake in pan with a little water in hot oven, one and a 
half houi-s. Serve hot with sugar and cream. A nice 
dessert. 

Sugar Vinegar. 

Dissolve twenty-five pounds of good brown sugar in 
hot rain waler, or soft water, then strain it into a 
clean vin^ar barrel with iron hoops, then fill up with 



228 The Queen Cook Book 

soft water strained; get a piece of what is called " the 
mother " from some other vinegar barrel and put in the 
barrel. It ought to stand in the sun for six weeks with 
a glass bottle in the bung. Then put it in a warm 
cellar till it is good, perhaps six months, but you will 
be provided with good vinegar for years to come, and 
always have the pure article^ at hand. We know not 
what injurious acids are in the vinegar we buy for 
cider vinegar. The sugar vinegar is the healthiest 
vinegar that is made and makes the best flavored 
pickles. 

Cucumber Pickles. 

Pick the cucumbers early in the morning, the small- 
est are the best, about three inches long; put a layer 
of salt in bottom of crock or cask and a layer of 
cucumbers, and then salt, and so on till it is full. Put 
a little water in at first, after that it makes its own 
brine. In the fall pour off this brine and wash them 
nicely. Scald a brine strong enough to bear up an 
egg; let it get very cold then pour it on. Cover the 
top with a double cloth and cover this with salt; the 
brine must cover it all. Take off the cloth and rinse 
it every two weeks to prevent any scum from rising, 
as it eats in and turns them soft. There must always 
be a double cloth on pickles whether in brine or 
vinegar, and rinsed off every two weeks, or they will 
soon mold. When you wish to put them in vinegar, 
take out what you wish and soak them three or four 
days in soft water; change it every day till they 
are freshened enough; then put them in cold vinegar; 
add a few peppers, ginger root and horseradish if you 
wish. They will be ready to eat in a week. It is bet- 
ter to put them in glass jars. Nasturtiums are a 



The Queen Cook Book 229 

pleasant addition. Pick them with the steams on; 
they are ornamental. Add them to any pickle you 
wish. Always use a granite or porcelain-lined kettle 
for all pickles or fruits; indeed, I think' they are the 
nicest for soups and all cooking. As pickles of all 
kinds are indigestible eat sparingly, as a relish only. 

Spiced Sweet Pickles. 

Sweet pickles should be rich and not cooked soft; 
can put in one-half ounce of ginger root if one likes it. 

Always prepare pickles in a porcelain-lined or granite 
kettle; use wooden spoon. If you wish your cucum- 
bers green, put them into cold vinegar in a granite 
kettle, stand them over a moderate fire, and heat 
slowly until they become green. 

Pears, quinces and plums are pickled in the same 
mannf»r as peaches. 

Mangoes. 

Use young or small musk or nutmeg melons or can- 
taloupe (which is a delicate variety of musk melon), 
wash and rub the melons well, cut out one section, 
scrape out the inside and wipe it out with a cloth, tie 
each section on to its own melon. Lay the mangoes 
in a good brine for three days, then drain off the 
brine, rinse it all off, and freshen in pure warm water 
for twenty-four hours (green them as cucumbers if 
you wish). Then fill each one with four string beans, 
two small cucumbers, a gherkin, a small tomato, just 
to fill them; then put in one tablespoon of the follow- 
ing mixture to each one. 



S30 The Queen Cook Book 

4 tablespoons English 2 teaspoons mace 
mustard seed 2 teaspoons ginger 

4 tablespoons grated i dozen pepper-corns 

horseradish i teaspoon celery-seed 

I teaspoon mustard i cup brown sugar 

6 nasturtiums 
Put the section on, sew it in with coarse thread, and 
pack in a deep stone jar; pour scalding vinegar (the 
sugar vinegar is the richest) over them, repeat this 
process three times more at intervals of two days, 
then put a double cloth over them a plate and a 
weight to keep them under the vinegar. These are 
fine and will keep for months. Watch them closely. 

Sweet Pickle of Watermelon Rind. 

Take firm thick rind, scrape the inside, pare ofif the 
green, cut in small pieces one inch wide and two long; 
boil in water until clear and a straw will pierce them; 
drain well, dry with a napkin, place in a jar; pour 
over the following, boiling hot, three days in succes- 
sion: for ten pounds of melon rind take four pounds of 
brown sugar, one quart best vinegar, one ounce of 
whole mace, one ounce whole cinnamon, half ounce 
of whole cloves; put the spices in a thin bag and boil 
in the vinegar, but not left in with the pickle, as it 
discolors the melon; put in a jar, having them fully 
covered with syrup; add more vinegar if needed. 

Spiced Cantaloupe. 

Select small nutmeg melons, a little green, not hard, 
neither quite ripe. . Cut them into sections as the rind 
is marked; pare, remove the seeds, scrape out clean; 
weigh the pieces. To each seven pounds allow four 
pounds of brown sugar and one pint of best vinegar* 



- The Queen Cook Book 231 

Put the sugar and vinegar in a porcelain lined kettle ; put 
in a bag a half ounce each of whole cloves, green ginger 
.and stick cinnamon. When hot put in the cantaloupe. 
Watch carefully until each piece is hot, but not soft. 
Cover the kettle and press the fruit down often. Lift 
each piece carefully and place in a stone jar. Put 
one teaspoon each of ground allspice, ground mace and 
cinnamon into a cup; mix; divide into fourths; tie each 
closely in a small piece of cheese cloth; put these in 
the jar, pour the syrup on the fruit and stand away 
till the next morning; then pour off all the liquor again; 
boil and strain it again for nine consecutive days. 
The last day take out the spices and boil the syrup 
down to the consistency of molasses; have enough 
syrup to cover well; press down; keep cool. 

Green Tomato Pickle. 

One peck green tamatoes, three onions, six green 
peppers; chop fine, squeeze the juice off through a 
colander; salt to taste; put on enough vinegar to scald 
up once; then let it cool and drain off the vinegar. 
Make a dressing of four cups of sugar, two tablespoons 
of mustard, two teaspoons black pepper, with vinegar 
enough to cover it well; heat and pour over. 

Spiced Peaches. 

7 pounds peaches ' % cup whole cloves 

4 pounds sugar }4 cup broken cinnamon 

I pint vinegar J^ pint water 

Put the sugar into the vinegar and water to dissolve, 
put spices in thin bag and let soak in hot syrup (after 
wetting them in hot water) while you rub the peaches 
hard with a coarse dry cloth to take off the fuzz; stick 
each peach with six cloves; put into the syrup to cook 



232 The Queen Cook Book 

as many peaches at a time, as the syrup will cover; let 
simmer till tender, but they must not break, then fill 
the cans, shake down and fill up with the syrup, let 
stand ten minutes, shake down again, fill to the brim, 
put a double cloth on to keep the top covered with 
syrup and seal. 

Sliced Tomato Pickles. 

One peck green tomatoes, six large onions. Slice 
and cook for five minutes in one quart of vinegar and 
two quarts of water and two tablespoons of salt. 
Drain well, then tie in a cheese cloth three table- 
spoons of white mustard seed, two tablespoons each of 
ground cloves, cinnamon and ginger and three green 
peppers chopped fine; put the bag in two quarts of 
vinegar with the pickles and boil all together till well 
seasoned; then can tight. 

Tomato Salad. 

Scald and peel as many ripe tomatoes as you need; 
lay in ice water till very cold, then slice them, pour 
off the juice. Pare and slice very thin two cucum- 
bers. Put some fresh lettuce leaves in the salad bowl 
with one small onion sliced fine; put all on the leaves 
and serve with a salad dressing. 

Tomato Sauce. 

Eight pounds of tomatoes, one quart of vinegar, 
three pounds sugar, one teaspoon cinnamon, one ojf 
cloves, one of English mustard and one of red pepper. 
Boil down till quite thick.

Cabbage Salab. 

Select a solid head and one that is white after the 
outside leaves are taken ofiF. Lay on a board and with 
a sharp knife cut fine; set in ice box till ready to use. 
Serve with salad dressing. 

Gooseberry Catsup — Very Fine. 

Pick off the blows of over a peck of gooseberries; 
wash; boil in granite kettle in just water enough to 
come to the top, and cook to pieces. Strain through 
a fine wire sieve. ' No seeds must rub through. Meas- 
ure the pulp, and to eight pints of pulp put six pints of 
sugar, four teaspoons of ground cinnamon, six tea- 
spoons of ground cloves. Boil till stiff enough not to 
run on the plate. This is very relishable when rightly 
made. As there , is no vinegar in it all stomachs can 
bear it. For a smaller quantity: To seven coffee 
cups of pulp put five cups of sugar, two teaspoons 
of cinnamon and three of cloves. Can or bottle 
tightly. 

Tomato Catsup. 

Put over in a porcelain kettle four quarts of peeled 
ripe tomatoes. Cook for half an hour till all is soft, 
then rub through a wire sieve. Return the juice to 
kettle; add two coffee cups of vinegar, four cups of 
sugar, a salt spoon of cayenne, a teaspoon each of 
ground cloves, ginger, allspice, pepper and mustard, 
one teaspoon of salt when first put over. Mix well all 
these ingredients in an earthen dish with the juice be- 
fore returning to the fire. Then let slow boilings evap- 
orate the water, stirring often, till thick enough not to 



234 The Queen Cook Book 

run on the plate. Can tightly while hot and it will 
keep indefinitely. 

Cold Catsup. 

To half a peck of ripe tomatoes, three green and 
three red peppers, and a large bunch of celery, all cut 
fine, add three pints of vinegar, one tablespoon of salt, 
one teacup white mustard seed, one teacup grated 
horseradish and two tablespoons of black pepper. 
Put these three last ingredients in a sheer cloth bag, 
let lie in it and soak, or mix them in it if you like, but 
I think it better not to. 



ODDS AND ENDS. 

F*RYiNG Salt Pqrk. 

As this was mislaid, I will insert it away from its 
regular family. It is very fine. Salt pork to be fried 
or baked should be cut over night and put to soak in 
cold water. In the morning, if not fresh enough, put 
it in hot water, drain off, roll each piece well in flour 
and place in a sheet iron pan in the oven, let it brown 
on both sides; it cooks much nicer in the oven. Send 
the pork to the table hot and crisp; if you wish to 
make a milk gravy of some of the fat, put it in a gravy 
dish. 

Veal Loaf. 

12 pounds veal ^ pound crackers 

^ pound butter i coffee cup water 

Have lean veal chopped fine (the butcher will chop 
it for you), but prepare it for chopping yourself, pep- 
per and salt it well. Mix all the ingredients in well.

The Queen Cook Book 235 

Cover the sides and bottom of a long four-inch wide 
pan with buttered paper, press it well together. Bake 
well done, from three to four hours. Can make one- 
fourth of it. Two poundsL chopped salt pork, three 
eggs» a littlec hopped parsley, is a fine addition to 
the veal. 

Veal Croquettes. 

Cook the veal tender, and make and cook the same 
as chicken croquettes. 

Veal Patties. 

Mix the same as for veal loaf, leaving out the pork; 
prepare the crust the same as for oyster patties. 
Bake the patties, fill just before using and heat hot. 

Breakfast Puffs. 

2 eggs I cup flour, salt 

1 tablespoon butter i cup milk 
I heaping teaspoon baking-powder. 

Sift flour and baking-powder together twice; beat 
the yolks well; stir all together and lastly stir in the 
stilly beaten whites. Fill the cups half full. Bake 
twenty-five or thirty minutes. 

Rusks. 

2 cups milk 3 tablespoons yeast 
\/i cup butter 2 eggs, salt 

I 2 tablespoons sugar. 

Put all in a sponge the night before except the eggs. 
In the morning add the well-beaten eggs; mix as soft 
as possible; roll out and cut with cutter. When 
ready to bake rub over the top with the sw^4dti9«^ed 
beaten white of an egg. 



13^ 7%^ Queen Cook Book 



Cbrman Toast. Over Fifty Years Old. 

Cut slices of stale bread of medium thickness, dip 
tftch in well beaten egg and milk with salt, sufficient 
to moisten (not soak) a little, then in cracker crumbs 
finely rolled. Brown both sides in flat spider as you 
would potatoes, in half butter and half lard. It is 
a change for a breakfast dish. 

Baking-Powder. 

2 pounds cream tartar i pound bi carb. soda 

6 ounces corn starch 
Mix well and put it through a sieve three times. 

Caramel Cream. 

Boil two coffee cups of best brown sugar, butter the 
the size of an egg, and two-thirds of a cup of thin 
sweet cream twelve minutes after it commences to 
boil. Dissolve one-half a cup of gelatine in as little 
water as will dissolve it; add this to it, and the rest 
of pint of cream. Strain and flavor with vanilla; put 
in a mold and let it stand over night. Serve with 
cream. 



CANDY. 

■ 

Ice Cream Candy. 

3 cups white sugar % teaspoon cream of tartar 

}i cup water 
Boil without stirring until when tried in cold water 
it is brittle. Turn into a buttered, platter, butter the 
hands as soon as cool enough to handle and pull it till 



The Queen Cook Booh 1%J 

it is white and glossy. Flavor and coler it whMi MiUly 
for pulling. Cut into sticks. 

Fig Candy. 

Take one pound of sugar, ^ pint of water, and 
set over a slow fire; when brittle add a few drops of 
vinegar, a lump of butter, and pour onto sliced figs. 

Cheese Straws. 

Mix one cup of grated cheese with one cup of floor, 
a half teaspoon salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, the 
yolks of two eggs and the white of one, butter th^ 
size of an egg. No water nor milk must be added as 
then they will not be crisp. Roll out to less than a 
fourth of an inch thick. Cut in strips seven or eight 
inches long and about one-half inch wide; place on 
buttered paper in long tins; bake in a moderate oven 
for five or more minutes; pile in aflat high dish laying 
two one way and two the other in log cabin style and 
the effect is very pretty. Tie each corner with rib- 
bons. Keep these in a tight tin box. If they gather 
dampness, dry five minutes in oven. 

How TO Pull Candy. 

As soon as it is boiled brittle, turn it on a buttered 
platter, as soon as cool enough to possibly handle, 
butter your hands, take up the candy what you can 
pull easily, throw it over a buttered hook and pull 
both ends toward you, then clap it together and pull 
over the hook again, repeating it till the candy is 
white and creamy. This . prevents blistering the 
hands.

Molasses Candy, 

1 pint N. O. molasses i pint best brown sugar 

2 tablespoons vinegar 2 tablespoons butter 
Warm and mix well together, then just boil without 

stirring till brittle when dropped in very cold water, 
then stir in two teaspoons of powdered bakings soda. 
Pull as directed above. When pulled enough cut in

Cream Chocolates. 

Beat the white of an egg on a plate, then beat in 
two tablespoons of water, then stir enough confec- 
tioner's XXX sugar to make a stiff paste, about one 
and a quarter pounds, one teaspoon vanilla. Work 
smooth, make into balls. Melt one-half pound of 
sweet chocolate in basin, stand it in hot water 
to melt. Set the balls on buttered paper in cool 
place for two or three hours to harden. Then with a 
fork dip one at a time into the melted chocolate (keep it 
hot in water), and place on the buttered paper till all 
are dipped. Stand in the cold over night.

6 ounces chocolate 
Stir and heat slowly till dissolved, then boil till it 
hardens. Fill pan the thickness desired; when partly 
cool, mark the squares. For peanut and walnut candy 
put the nuts into molasses candy.

CARVING. 

It is no trifling accomplishment to be able to carve 
well and skilfully. It occurs at least once a day in 
every family, and it is better for both men and women 
to be able to do it with dispatch and elegance. All 
display of over-exertion is in bad taste. A little atten- 
tion and experience will soon put one at ease in his 
seat of honor. It is well to call the attention of 
younger persons to observe how it is done, that they, 
too, may serve their turn. A sharp knife is an abso- 
lute necessity to exhibit the ability of the carver. We 
know it is not considered proper to stand while 
carving for company, though it is much easier, but we 
will. not be fastidious. In roasts such as ribs, fore- 
quarters, etc., the butcher should be instructed to sep- 
arate the joints. Fowls are easily carved. Ducks 
have strong ligaments and are therefore more difficult 
to carve. Place the turkey on its back on the platter, 
as it was roasted (to a good brown), putting the head 
to the right-hand of the carver. Fix the fork firmly 
in the lower end of the breast and you need not 
remove it till the turkey is nearly all cut up. First 
sever the legs and wings on both sides (if the whole is 
to be served), cutting neatly through the joint next 
the body. Then cut slices from the breast length- 
wise, beginning on the lower part, and laying the 
pieces neatly on the side of the platter; then un joint 
the legs and wings at the middle joint, which can be 
struck almost exactly by an expert carver, or after a 
little practice. Consult the tastes of the guests as to 
which part is preferred; if no preference is expressed, 
serve a portion of both light and dark meat, with a 
spoonful of dressing, and gravy (unless it is notde- 



94# The Queen Cpeh Book 

mr^d). The dretiing is more accessible if the bird is 
placed with the head to the left. A chicken is carved 
the same way, whether roasted or broiled. A little 
more dexterity and force are needed to carve a goose 
than a turkey, though carved in the same way. The 
breast of a goose is considered the choicest part; 
all the meat is good and full of juicy flavor. 

Roast Duck. 

No other dishes require so much skill in carving as 
game and poultry; as it is necessary to be well ac- 
quainted with the anatomy of the bird, or know just 
the location of the joints, in order to place the knife 
at exactly the right point. The wing of a flyer and 
the leg of a swimmer are the most desirable portions 
of a duck, after the breast. 

A tame duck is nice stuffed as a turkey and roasted, 
also split open on the back and put in the oven in 
the roasting pan, on the rack, and basted. Wild 
ducks should be split open on the back, put on the 
rack in a well heated oven, for twenty minutes or less, 
they should he rare, but boiling hot through. When 
wild ducks live on rice their meat is much the richest 
eating. 

To Makb Bread Without a Sponge. 

For the yeast: 
4 quarts boiled water 1 2 potatoes, pared 

2 tablespoons white sugar 2 tablespoons salt 

3 tablespoons flour i Twin Bros. ' yeast cake 
Make this the day before baking; the yeast is all the 

wetting you need; do not sponge it. The yeast will 
keep two or three weeks. Pare medium sized pota- 
toed and boil just done in two quarts of the boiled 



The Queen Cook Book 141 

water, then mash and put through a colander into a 
crock, with the water they were boiled in, then add 
the other two quarts of hot water, making four quarts, 
then sugar, salt and flour; when it is cool enough to 
hold the finger in, add the yeast soaked in a cup of 
warm water. Let stand over night, in a warm place, 
stirring once an hour till bed time. Next morning let 
it get warm, give it a good stir, and use one pint of it 
for one large loaf of bread, an even teaspoon of salt. 
Knead it twenty minutes. Do not sponge it, but mix 
it right up as soft as you can knead it, as other bread, 
and put it in pans. It will be light enough in three 
hours to bake, while you are getting dinner. Put the 
rest of the yeast in glass cans, seal tight, keep in cel- 
lar. Remember, no other wetting but the yeast. Do 
not use the bread till next day, as no bread should be 
eaten the day it is baked. 

To Make Butter. 

Cream at a temperature of 58° Fahrenheit, will 
churn in from fifteen to twenty minutes. Do not 
churn on the gallop but with a quiet steady hand 
without leaving it. When it comes whirl the dasher 
some, to gather the particles of butter together. Do 
not have it soft, as no standing will make it right 
again. Some prefer to take it up into very cold water 
to work out the first buttermilk, others think it not 
well to do so. Put two heaping teaspoons of salt to 
every pound of butter, working out the buttermilk so 
as not to mash the grain (this is a knack or quality 
that few possess), work it ten minutes, then set it 
away till next morning, taste to see if it is salt enough, 
if not, add more and work it again till all the butter- 
milk is out. Make it into rolls and keep it in a cool 



24^ The Queen Cook Book 

place, covered tight, as it absorbs everything in 
the atmosphere. Butter made while the cow can 
obtain grass, from the first of June to the last of Octo- 
ber, has a superior flavor and is esteemed more highly 
than that made in winter. Winter butter can be im- 
proved by feeding the cows silage that is clean and 
sweet, with plenty of grain or well cured green cut 
clover or corn stalks cut ^nd gathered green; add to 
these generous feedings of bran middlings with one 
quart of corn meal in it, or linseed meal. Put a little 
salt in her food and do not give her very cold water in 
the five winter months. One new milch cow will im- 
prove the flavor of all the butter from a small herd. 
Butter gains nothing by being kept over two or three 
weeks and loses much in delicacy of flavor by such 
treatment. The flavor of the Jersey milk and butter 
is going into disrepute. Cows fed upon rich nutritious 
food, with some corn meal and yellow carrots will 
make more highly colored butter than if fed on 
hay. The ripening of the cream decides largely 
the flavor of the butter in winter. Sour cream makes 
the best butter, but not aged. About sixty or sixty- 
five degrees will ripen it in twenty-four hours. Skim 
each milking when it is twenty-four hours old, whether 
sour or not, and for the cream from each cow put in 
the cream crock two cups of sour buttermilk from the 
last churning as a starter in the winter and keep the 
cream at a temperature of fifty-eight degrees, which is 
right for churning, some say sixty-two; try it. A 
thermometer to test the cream is as necessary as a 
churn. Irenaeus of the New York Observer tells us 
of a Mr. Starr, a friend of his that lived at Litchfield, 
Connecticut, who had a splendid dairy. " Mr. Starr's 
method of setting his milk for cream, is not in shallow 
pans, as the women of old were wont to do; but in 



* _ 



The Queen Cook Book 245 

narrow vessels about twenty inches deep, standing in 
ice water, or a very cold place. Not only does this 
low temperature reduce the process of change to a 
minimum, but quite unexpectedly, it also greatly facil- 
itates the rising of the cream, as the cream is nearly 
all obtained in twelve hours. The butter churned 
from the product is not only pure in flavor, but has 
remarkable keeping qualities. The plan is spreading 
rapidly." This might work in a large dairy. 

Celery. 

Earthing up celery is necessary when it is wanted 
for autumn or early winter use; but for late winter and 
spring we never had clearer and whiter stalks than 
from those plants which were not earthed up at all. 
Just before winter sets in we had the plants carefully 
lifted out with a spade, the roots with the earth partly 
shaken off, the plants then neatly and compactly 
placed upright in a trench, in a hollow where the 
wind could not blow, and covered with a foot of dead 
leaves. They were perfectly blanched in this trench, 
and kept better than when the blanching had been 
previously done. This is easily taken out when 
wanted. 

An Ice House. 

Make a bin in the open air fourteen by sixteen feet, 
of hemlock boards, with four-inch scantling for posts, 
and roof it over, leaving the gable ends and three 
feet on the front side open. Fill in with six inches of 
course chips for drainage; and put on these ten 
inches of saw dust. Pack the ice in the center, and 
cover top and sides with eighteen inches of saw dust. 
The ice will keep perfectly. Build it in the shade if 
possible.

Gruels for the Sick. 

The lightest possible gruel is made by taking two 
heaping tablespoons of yellow corn meal, pour upon it 
one teacup cold water and stir well. Let settle a 
little and pour this water off into a teacup of water at 
a keen boU and scald for five minutes. A little salt. 

Milk Porridge. 

One pint of milk, wet one heaping teaspoon of flour 
with two tablespoons of the cold milk, a little salt, stir 
this into the boiling milk. Boil three to six minutes. 
Excellent for diarrhoea. 

Oat Meal Gruel. 

Into one quart of boiling water or milk as you like, 
stir in two tablespoons of oat meal and a little salt. 
Boil forty minutes and strain if you like. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

1 quart water or milk i tablespoon flour 

2 tablespoons corn meal i teaspoon salt 

Wet the flour and meal and pour into the boili&g 
water. Boil forty minutes. 

Cracker Panada. 

Put in double boiler one quart of milk or water as 
the patient can bear, stir in six tablespoons of sifted 
rolled cracker and one half teaspoon of salt. Let boil 
three minutes. Add a little nutmeg, sugar and wine 
if you like. 



The Queen Cook Book 245 



Arrowroot Gruel. 

To one pint of milk or water, one teaspoon of arrow- 
root, a little salt; wet it with cold milk, stir it in the 
boiling milk, and boil ten minutes in double boiler. 

Ice Cream for the Sick. 

I cup milk I pint cream 

I teaspoon arrowroot % cup sugar 

Scald it all and freeze as directed. 

Veal Sweet Breads. 

These are considered a great delicacy by some. 
There are two in a calf, one from near the heart called 
the "heart sweet bread,'* the other from the neck 
called the " throat sweet bread. " The first is most 
delicate. They spoil very soon and need to be en- 
gaged beforehand, that the butcher may send them to 
you as soon as the animal is dressed. Put it imme- 
diately in warm water, to which add a tablespoon of 
salt, to soak out the blood; soak one hour, then wash 
it in cold water. Draw strips of salt pork through it 
and put in good soup stock or water and boil twenty 
minutes. As soon as cool enough remove the skinny 
portions and pipes. Cook in granite kettle and use a 
silver knife and fork, as they contain a peculiar acid 
that acts upon iron or tin. After it is thus prepared 
you can fricassee, slice and fry, broil or bake, after 
rubbing it with butter and seasoning. 

Mushrooms. 

As we so often see the notice, " Died from toadstool 
in mistake for mushrooms/' I have refrained from 
giving the different recipes for cooking mushrooms^ as 



246 The Queen Cook Book 

I feel the risk is too great for the pleasure it might 
give. Any real mushrooms are poisonous if picked 
over an hour after they are open. If any one will eat 
them, they can be stewed, baked or broiled, with sea- 
soning of butter and a little salt and pepper. I quote: 
" The difference between a toadstool and a mushroom 
is the difference between an eel and a rattlesnake — in 
effect. There is but one sure way of telling the differ- 
ence. The stems of the mushrooms are generally 
shorter, thicker, and invariably solid; the stems of the 
toadstools are hollow." This author says he has picked 
and eaten many mushrooms, using this test alone. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 

Making Over Hair Mattresses. 

Empty the tick, wash it nicely with hard soap and 
enough borax to soften the water. Spread the hair 
on clean boards or sheets, and whip the dust out 
entirely then pick it up fine. If for any reason it 
should need washing, wash it in warm suds, rinse and 
spread to dry. Weigh all the hair, then weigh one- 
fourth for each corner .of tick. Dividing this way 
will be of great assistance in getting it evenly laid. 
You need a mattress needle and strong twine. Put 
the under tuft in first, in a slip, a noose, at the end of 
the double twine, then put the needle up through 
the mattress, tie it tight, then tie in the upper tuft 
with three knots. 

To Clean a Teakettle of Lime. 

The thick incrustations that form upon the inside of 
teakettles when hard water is used, can be easily re- 
moved by putting in two quarts ofj^es and filling up 



The Queen Cook Booh 247 

with water, let boil and soak three hours. While hot 
empty it out and scrape it clean with an iron spoon. 
It will easily peel off. 

To Clean Moldy Jugs. 

Wash clean with ashes and soapsuds, rinse well, fill 
w-ith hot water, put in a teaspoon of carbolic acid, set 
it away from sight where no one will see it for a few 
hours, as it is a deadly poison. Then empty it and 
wash and rinse well and it will be as sweet as if it had 
not been tainted. 

Ropy Milk. 

When the milk is ropy there is probably inflamma- 
tion of the udder. The milk is acid, and becomes 
clotted; this is a conditional defect arising from dis- 
eased blood. An authority writes, give a dose of 
twelve ounces of Epsom salts, and before milking in- 
ject by a S3rringe, one-fourth of a pint of solution of 
carbonate of soda into the teat, and after fifteen 
minutes milk it out. Dissolve one-fourth of a tea- 
spoon of soda in one-half cup of warm' water. 

Care of Canaries. 

Clean the cage thoroughly every morning, and accus- 
tom them to plenty of light and company, but not to 
sudden noises; do not hang the cage in a draft. Give 
it clean water for its bath every morning. Feed it with 
mixed canary seed, a piece of bread and occasionally 
spread it with a little butter and sprinkle a very little 
red pepper on it, give it a lump of sugar, a cuttle 
bone, apple, a little sand in bottom of cage, and in 
the summer chick weed. If at any time the bird is 



248 The Queen Cook Book 

hoarse, give it a piece of fat salt pork and tee how 
he will enjoy it, and listen for the result. If he ap- 
pears dumpy riemember the bread and butter with the 
sprinkle of red pepper. If kept perfectly clean no 
vermin will come to them, but if you only clean 
them twice a week there is danger. If you are so 
unfortunate as to have these pests clean thoroughly, 
take the cage to pieces, boil the perches, then put in a 
lump of sugar; they will bury themselves in it, and 
also a little bit of cotton on each end of perch to 
attract those that still remain on the bird. Remove 
and burn it and the sugar daily and clean the same 
way and they will be gone soon. Never allow any 
one to tease a bird. 

Pure Unfermented Wine. 

Use perfectly ripe grapes, wash, pick out all defect- 
ive ones; mash with the hands, scald, press out the 
juice, boil it gently until all the scum rises, skim it 
repeatedly till clear, and bottle while hot, cork and 
seal, or put it in tight fruit jars. Keep in a cool, 
dark place. Sweeten to the taste when used. The 
above is considered the best for communion purposes. 

To Insure Long Life. 

Dr. Abernethey, the great Scotch physician*s secret 
of success in the healing art, and rules of living to in- 
sure longevity, found among his effects in a sealed 
envelope, and for which $5,000 was paid, contained 
these words: " To insure continued health, and a 
ripe old age, keep the head cool, the feet warm, and 
the system open. To secure these conditions keep 
the ten commandments, observe the laws of life and 
the science of health. " If one does not know how, 



The Queen Cook Book 249 

take some good health journal. Eight hours* sleep 
each day. Open air exercise every day. Air the 
sleeping room from one to two hours daily. The use 
of plain food with plenty of fruit. Frequent bathing. 
Flannel of some kind next the skin the year round. 

The Brain. 

It is not so much intellectual work that injures the 
brain, if one takes physical exercise, but undue emo- 
tional excitement. Most men can stand the severest 
thought and study of which their brains are capable, 
and be none the worse for it, provided they can re- 
cuperate with quiet sleep and out-of-door exercise. 
It is over ambition, anxiety, disappointment, bad 
habits, the hopes and fears,* the loves and hates of 
our lives, that wear out the nervous system, and en- 
danger the balance of the brain. 

Tooth Ache or Neuralgia. 

A white flannel bag filled with good hops wet with 
boiling water and applied hot, is sometimes wonderful 
in its power to sooth a tooth-ache, a neuralgia head- 
ache or a sharp pain anywhere, and send the patient 
to sleep. 

Warts and Corns. 

Rub the wart with lemon and bind on a piece three 
times a day for a week. The wart will diminish till 
it disappears. Do the same with corns, rubbing night 
and morning and bind on at night. 

Poisoning. 

In case of poisoning the simple rule is to get the 
poison out of the stomach instantly, for it assimilates 
very soon. Mustard and salt act very promptly and 



250 Th0 Qtieen Cook Book 

are always at hand. Stir a teaspoonful of each in a 
glass of water and swallow it quickly. If it does not 
cause vomiting in five minutes, repeat the dose. 
After vomiting, give the unbeaten whites of two or 
three eggs. Send for the doctor the first thing, but 
go right to work with the emetic. 

The Complexion. 

As so many ladies are in the habit of using dry mag- 
nesia as a toilet powder, I feel constrained to warn 
them against it, both from observation and from the 
pronouncing of chemists that it is very injurious to the 
skin, as it dries the cuticle and causes the skin to be- 
come rough and scaly. If you have used it, we advise 
you to stop at once, and heal the face with a weak 
solution of borax, water and a little glycerine. 
Most toilet powders on the market contain magnesia. 
The curious prejudice that some people have against 
using soap on the face, is a great fallacy. Good toilet 
soap is the best purifier and preventive of the uncomely 
looking blackheads so often seen. But if you have 
them, wash daily with a cloth, warm water and soap. 
Press them out with the open end of a watch key. 

To Cure a Sty. 

Rub into a small pinch of powdered alum enough 
of the v/hite of an egg to make a paste. It will be- 
come a curd. Put it between two fine pieces of thin 
goods and bind it on the eye at night. ^ It is said the 
sty will be gone in the morning. 

Insect Bites and Stings. 

The bites of mosquitoes, bees, wasps, hornets, scor- 
pions, may be instantly relieved by the immediate and 
free application of ammonia (hartshorn) as a wash to 



The Queen Cook Book d$t 

the part bitten. Then cover it with a cloth dipped in 
sweet oil. 

CtJRE FOR Rattlesnake Poison. 

This is a convenient and simple remedy, used by the 
Indians more than one hundred years ago, and by the 
early settlers of our country. A small cupful of the juice 
of the plantain weed, which is to be found along the 
roadbed and in nearly every country door yard. Inquiry 
made among farmers and country people generally, elic- 
ited the information that plaintain weed is used exten- 
sively for poulticing, to heal running sores, and to 
break up cases of chills and fever. Dr. A. H. Palmer, 
of Marlborough, N. Y. , says that a handful of plan- 
tain leaves made into a cup of tea, breaks up severe 
attacks of certain malarial disorders when other spe- 
cifics fail. Wood choppers on the Shawangunk Mount- 
ains say they have long known that plaintain juice 
would prevent fatal results from the bite of a rattle- 
snake. Toads and other animals seem to know the 
medicinal properties of the plantain weed. When 
bitten by a snake they invariably hop to where the 
specific can be found. Also apply ammonia to the

In the open air, during violent storms of any kind, 
the safest situation is to keep aloof from trees, and 
as far as possible from any and all elevated structures 
and regard the storm, the torrents of rain, though it 
may saturate the clothes, as a protection against the 
lightning's stroke; for wet clothes would supply so good 
a conductor that a very large amount of electricity 
would past over a person's body through them, while 



^52 The Queen Cook Book 

the person would be quite unconscious of it^ The 
rain itself, in its usual form, is one of the best con- 
ductors known to modem chemists and electricians. 
Lightning rods are said to be no protection unless they 
teach water in the earth. 

The Laughing Cure. 

A shrewd lady who had recovered from a decline, 
was asked what cured her. " I stopped worrying and 
began to laugh, that is all/' was the reply. 

Piano. 

Do not always keep the piano closed, if you wish 
the keys to remain white. If the keys do not respond 
readily, there is dampness inside; open the top till 
all right, then open it once a week. 

For Hives in Children. 

Rub the irritated skin or postules with castor oil 
applied with the fingers. Baby will soon slumber. 

Restoring the Drowned. 

[Prepared by Dr. Benjamin Howard, approved by the Academy 
of Medicine and adopted by the Lite Saving Society; of New 
York,] 

The first thing to be done is to arouse the patient if 
possible without moving him. Instantly expose the face 
to a current of fresh air; wipe dry the mouth and nostrils, 
rip the clothing so as to expose the chest and waist, 
and give two or three quick smarting slaps on the 
stomach and chest with the open hand. If the 
patient does not revive, then proceed as follows: 

Rule /. Turn the patient on his face, a large 
bundle of tightly-rolled clothing being placed beneath 



The Queen Cook Book 253 

stomach, and press heavily over it for half a 
minute, or so 'long as fluids flow freely from the 
mouth. 

Rule II, Turn the patient on his back, the roll of 
clothing being so placed beneath it as to raise the pit 
of the stomach above the level of any other part of the 
body. If there be another person present, let him, 
with a piece of dry cloth, hold the tip of the tongue out 
of one corner of the mouth, and with the other hand 
grasp both wrists and keep the arms forcibly stretched 
back above the head. The position prevents the 
tongue from falling back and choking the entrance to 
the windpipe, and increasing the prominence of the 
ribs tends to enlarge the chest; it is not, however, 
essential to success. 

Kneel beside, or astride the patient's hips, and with 
the balls of the thumbs resting on either side the pit 
of the stomach, let the fingers fall into the grooves 
between the short ribs, so as to afford the best grasp 
of the waist. Now, using your knees as a pivot, 
throw all your weight forward on your hands, and at 
the same time squeeze the waist between them, as if 
you wished to force everything in the chest upward 
out of the mouth; deepen the pressure while you can 
count slowly, one, two, three; then suddenly let go 
with a final push, which springs you back to your first 
kneeling position. Remain erect on your knees while 
you can count one, two; then repeat the same motions 
as before, at a rate gradually increased from four or 
five to fifteen times in a minute, and continue thus this 
bellows movement with the same regularity that is 
observable in the natural motions of breathing, which 
you are imitating. 

Continue thus for from one to two hours, or until 
the patient breathes; for awhile after, carefully deepen 



^54 t'^^ Queen Cook Book 

the first short gasps into full breaths, and continue the 
drying and rubbing, which should have been unceas- 
ingly practiced from the beginning. 

AFTER TREATMENT. 

As soon as the breathing has been established, strip 
the patient, wrap him in blankets only, put him in a 
bed comfortably warm, but with a free circulation of 
fresh air, and leave him to perfect rest. If necessary 
give a little hot brandy and water, or other stimu- 
lant at hand, for every ten or fifteen minutes for the 
first hour, and as often thereafter as may seem expe- 
dient. 

Family Remedies. 

To inhale turpentine has proved of great service in 
bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy and other throat and 
lung affections. If you have a cough, sprinkle a little 
on a cloth and hold it to your mouth and nose for a 
few minutes, breathing the odor and note the relief. 

For all Lung Trouble. 

Mix equal parts of turpentine and olive tar; bathe 
the spot affected daily and cover with oiled silk. Wear 
it night and day till well, and for a cough take wild 
black cherry cough syrup also. 

Wild Black Cherry Cough Syrup. 

5^ pound wild black cherry 3 pounds loaf sugar 
bark i quart water 

4 oz. tincture ipecacuanha 4 oz. paregoric 

4 oz. tincture bloodroot 4 oz. antimonial wine 
Take the inside of the bark, soak it over night in an 

earthen covered dish. In the morning let it simmer 



The Queen Cook Book 2$$ 

(ndt boil) till reduced to one pint of the water; keep it 
covered all the time. The bark will absorb some of 
the water. Strain it hot on the sugar, then stir 
in the other four ingredients. Set the pitcher 
of syrup in hot water to dissolve the sugar; 
keep it covered. When sugar is dissolved bot- 
tle and cork tightly. Dose: one teaspoon every 
four hours, or pour some in a cup and set beside 
you and sip one-fourth of a teaspoon whenever you 
cough, if bad. This has cured the writer of a bad cough 
some three times, but do not let your cough continue a 
year or two before taking it, or applying the olive tar 
and then say " it does no good.'* I know of three 
persons who had coughed a long time, whose lives 
were prolonged many years by the use of it. Obtain 
fresh bark from the tree. 

Cough Syrup. 

Mix equal quantities of unboiled linseed oil, Holland 
gin and strained honey well together. Dose: Take 
one teaspoon every three hours or sip some every time 
you cough. This is excellent for a common cough or 
where one coughs when attempting to speak. 

Cough Syrup. 

I ounce gum arabic i ounce liquorice extract 

I ounce paregoric i ounce tinct. bloodroot. 

Mix loaf sugar enough with this for a syrup. Dose: 
Take one teaspoon every four hours or so. 

Rhubarb Syrup for Infants. 

One heaping tablespoon of floured Turkey rhubarb, 
one teaspoon of soda, two gills of the best French 
brandy, two gills of soft water, lump sugar for aiyrup. 



2$$ The Queen Cook Book 

Dose: one-half to a teaspoon, according to wfjt. 
Good for an acid stomach. 

Burns. 

The white of an egg is very efficacious for burns. 
Seven or eight applications will sooth the pain and ex- 
clude the burned part from the air. I should try a 
flour paste, made of egg and flour, just stiff enough 
not to run; spread it on a cloth and change it as often 
as it begins to dry. Another good remedy is to 
moisten saleratus enough to make a paste and spread 
it on a cloth; if it gets dry dampen and add more. 

Stair Rods. 

Clean brass stair rods with kerosene oil and rotten 
stone. Rub long and hard and polish with chamois 
skin and they will keep bright a year. 

Flat Irons. 

Clean smoothing irons by rubbing over them a piece 
of beeswax in a cloth while hot. Salts of lemon will 
take stains from ivory knife handles. 

Corns. 

Apply at night a poultice made of dry bread soaked 
in vinegar, in the morning the soreness will be gone 
and the corn can be removed; if not, do it for three 
times or through the day, if you can. A piece of 
lemon bound on will sometimes take out the soreness 
so it can be cut. 

Another — 

To cure corns, let a ^niall piece of potash remain in 
$^« open aur until it slakes, then thicken to a paste 



The Queen Cook Book «5y 

with pulverised gum arabic. Pare the corn and apply 
the paste, leaving it on ten minutes; soak the corn in 
strong hot vinegar for a little while, then leave it alone 
and it will soon come out. Do not wear too tight 
shoes. The ring corn plasters are found to be a great 
relief. Wet it and hold it on till dry. Keep a stock- 
ing on all night, that it may not rub off. Wear them 
continuously, till you can cut the corn off. 

Lockjaw. 

Let any one who has an attack of lockjaw take a 
small quantity of turpentine, warm it and pour it on 
the wound, no matter where the wound is, and relief 
will follow in less than a minute. Nothing better can 
be applied to a severe cut or bruise than cold turpen- 
tine; it will give certain relief. If too severe mix it 
with sweet oil, half and half. 

Swelled Feet and Ankles. 

Take plantain leaves, which can be found in almost 
any wet grass-plat; wilt them by putting separately 
between the hands and warming them; cover the 
swollen parts with them, and keep in place by winding 
a narrow strip of cloth around in spiral form. Keep 
them on day and night, renewing as they dry. 

For Burns. 

Procure a few ounces of palm oil from a tallow 
chandler, it is like lard; spread it on a cloth and apply. 
It will cure the worst burns. 

« 

Chilblains. 

1 oz. Burgundy pitch i oz. sperm oil 

2 oz. beeswax ^ oz. turpentine 
Simmer the first three ingredients well together, and 



258 The Queen Cook Book 

when nearly cool add the turpentine. Spread on a 
cloth and put the plaster on the-affected spot, after the 
feet have been well washed in very hot water. If not 
relieved in three days repeat the process. 

Home Messenger, 

Another remedy is, take off the boot and hold the 
foot, with the sock on, as near the fire as one can stand 
the heat; if it gets too hot to bear withdraw it, and put 
it near the fire again. Heat it in this way for ten 
minutes, keeping it as hot as the pain will permit with- 
out blistering. Repeat every time it returns, after 
bathing the parts with a mixture of kerosene oil and 
salt. This is too severe for children — must use the 
plaster for children. 

Acidity of the Stomach. 

A sufferer from want of appetite and acid stomach 
can be greatly benefited by leaving all medicines 
alone, and for a time existing entirely on milk and lime- 
water. A tablespoon of lime-water to a tumbler of 
milk. If this disagrees in any way, increase the quan- 
tity of lime-water. This is made by taking a bowl of 
unslacked lime, and pour on slowly several quarts of 
boiling water, perhaps three or four; till well, let 
settle over night and bottle it. 

Toothache. 

Go to a dentist and have it cleaned and filled. If 
not near a dentist, saturate a piece of cotton with cam- 
phor or peppermint and put it in the cavity, and bathe 
the side of the face with it.

Washes for Inflamed Eyes. 

Wash frequently in as hot rain water as you can 
bear, then lay the warm wet cloth on. If that does 
not cure, wash them in green tea. If neither of these 
cure, take sulph. zinc, two grains; wine of opium, ten 
drops; distilled water, one ounce; mix. Lie flat on 
the back and drop two or three drops in the outer 
corner of the eye three times a day. 

Consumption. 

Dr. Marshall Hall, an eminent physician, says, " If 
I were seriously ill of consumption, I would live out of 
doors, except in rainy weather or mid- winter.** Lift 
the windows more or less every night according to 
weather, wearing something over the head, but have 
plenty of fresh air to breathe every breath. An ex- 
cellent thing to ease a cough is to drink plentifully 
of slippery-elm and flaxseed teas, mixed with loaf sugar 
and lemon juice. Use wild cherry cough syrup. 

Indigestion. 

It is said that Voltaire was once troubled for nearly 
a year with decay of the stomach and the difficulty of 
finding any kind of food it could bear. Voltaire said 
he was cured by taking no other food than the follow- 
ing prescription recommended by Sir John Sinclair: 
Beat up an egg and then add six tablespoons of cold 
water, mixing well together; then add two tablespoons 
of farina of potatoes; mix it well in the egg; then pour 
in as much boiling water only as will convert the 
whole into a jelly, stirring well. It may be taken 
alone or with the addition of a little milk in case of 
stomachic debility from consumptive disorders.

Catarrh. 

A twenty-year sufferer was cured of this disease by 
smoking dried muUen leaves, three times a day, two 
or three pipes full at a time. Close the mouth and 
draw the smoke through the nostrils. It is some six or 
seven years since the cure. Received some benefit 
after one week; would advise smoking one or two 
years till cured.

Sore Nipples. 

Bathe with a strong decoction of best Japan tea; 
make it fresh every day. Bathe and let dry and put 
on a plaster of Dalley's pain extractor or ointment. 
Repeat this every -eight hours, after nursing. Do not 
nurse the child but once in four hours, giving rest to 
each side eight hours. Wash off before nursing. A 
sure cure, if rightly used. 

A Remedy for Croup. 

Let a healthy person fill his lungs with pure air; 
then slowly breathe upon the patient's throat and 
chest, commencing at the point of the chin and mov- 
ing slowly down to the bottom of the windpipe. Re- 
peat for a few minutes and it will give relief in cases 
where all other means fail. My boy was always sub- 
ject to. croup; came near dying with the rattling noisy 

kind at about eleven months old, I saved him with 



The Queen Cook Booh J6l 

fomentations of warm water (as hot as they can bear). 
When three years old I let him play in the brook one 
warm, rainy day and he took a severe cold and had 
the still kind of croup. In spite of all I could do he 
grew constantly worse until he could only gasp and 
breathe with his head thrown back.) I applied the 
breathing remedy for a minute. When I stopped he 
looked up and said " Do so again, Mother, do/' though 
he could not speak when I began. You may be assured* 
I did so again, and I believe it saved his life. 

Home Messenger. 

Some affirm that croup may be cured in one minute 
by simply using floured alum and sugar. Take one 
teaspoon of floured alum and mix well with two tea- 
spoons of powdered sugar. I do not know how it is 
administered, but I should carefully place a little each 
side of the throat, and often, but I think I should 
moisten it a little, for fear of sucking the dry powder 
into the windpipe. After using hot ' cloths, bathe the 
throat with equal quantities of sweet oil and turpen- 
tine. Keep the feet warm. 

Croup of Children. 

Many a lovely child is destroyed in a single night by 
this alarming disease. Its nature is described in the 
first part. It is a disease of the windpipe, which is 
filled or lined with a phlegm, which becomes more 
and more tough, almost leathery, thickens, and at 
length closes up the passage to the lungs and the child 
dies. It usually comes on in the night. The destin- 
guishing symptom is a wheezing, barking cough. A 
mother who has ever heard it once needs no descrip- 
tion to enable her to recognize it again. The first 
bon are the most likely to perish with it, simply be- 



262 . The Queen Cook Book 

cause the parent has no experience of its nature^ and 
hence is not alarmed in time or knows not what to do 
while the physician is being sent for. In the hope of 
being instrumental in saving some little sufferer whose 
life is inexpressibly dear, at least to one or two, I will 
make some suggestions, not for the cure of the patient, 
but to save time. The instant you perceive the child 
has croup, indicated by the cough, uneasy breathing, 
restlessness, send for a physician, and as instantly 
wrap a hot flannel around each foot to keep it warm; 
while the flannels are being heated, dip another flannel 
of two or more thicknesses in spirits of turpentine, or 
spirits of hartshorn, or have a large mustard plaster 
applied, one that will reach from the top of the throat 
down to some two inches below the collar bones, wide 
enough at the top to reach half way around the neck 
on either side, and nearly across the whole breast at 
bottom. But it will take time to send for a physician, 
to prepare flannels, and to make the plaster or to 
obtain the turpentined flannel, and in some cases fif- 
teen minutes is an age — ^is death, if lost; therefore, 
while these things are preparing, give the child if one 
year old or over (and half as much if less), about 
half a teaspoonful of hive syrup, and double the dose 
every fifteen minutes until vomiting is produced; and 
every half hour after vomiting give half as much as 
caused the vomiting, until the physician comes, or the 
child ceases to cough, when he breathes free and is 
safe. If you have no hive syrup, give a teaspoonful 
or half teaspoon of syrup of ipecac (accord- 
ing- to age), and double the dose every fifteen 
minutes until vomiting is produced. If you have been 
so thoughtless as to have nothing at all, boil some 
water, keep it boiling, dip a woolen flannel of several 
folds into it, squeeze it out moderately with your hand, 



The Queen Cook Book . 263 

and apply it as hot as the child can possibly bear to 
the throat, and in from one to three minutes, accord- 
ing to the violence of the symptoms, have another to 
put on the instant the first is removed, and keep this 
up until the breathing is easy, and the cough is loose 
and the phlegm is . freely discharged, or until the 
arrival of the physician. 

A Small-pox Remedy. 

Last April Dr. James Moore, of Ironton, Ohio, pub- 
lished his experience with lemons as a remedy for 
small-pox. It is as follows: 

" I was taken sick April 14th with what I supposed was 
a severe cold, having had my hair shingled the pre- 
vious Friday. The 14th I was quite feverish, with a 
severe pain in the head and back. Saturday, i6th, I 
was no better; Sunday, fever somewhat reduced, I 
presume by the aid of aconite, which had been ad- 
ministered to me by Drs. Morris and Dunn; eruption 
very indistinct underneath the skin. 

" Monday morning, i8th, eruption unmistakably that 
of small-pox. Tuesday morning eruption very abund- 
ant, crop increasing rapidly in size and number. 
Wednesday morning a very dense crop all over the 
face, forehead, scalp of head, neck, and soles of feet. 
Upon the arms, hands, legs and body, they were 
pretty evenly distributed, but not so closely packed 
as upon the above mentioned parts. By evening I 
was suffering intensely from those on the scalp. By 
10:30 o'clock the pain was almost intolerable. My 
nurse had retired and was sound asleep in bed. My 
feet were so tender that I dare not let them touch the 
foot-board of the bed. My head I could not sufier to 
lie on the pillow. I lay, raised on my elbow, my 
neck resting upon my hand. I had by this *ime be- 



264 The Queen Cook Book 

come so nervous I dare not shut my eyes from fear of 
seeing unpleasant visions. Pulse about 90. I had 
upon the table at the bedside a pitcher of water and a 
drinking glass, a box of seidlitz powders and an ounce 
of chlorate of potash in crystals. I had also at my 
bedside a paper of lemons, also one of oranges. 
These were all the agents within my reach. 

" I recollected that lemon juice in sufficient quantity 
was a sedative, and would lower the heart's action, 
and by so doing might relieve me of those unpleasant 
visions. I therefore squeezed all the juice I possibly 
could out of one of the lemons into the glass, to 
which I added about two tablespoonsful of water and 
drank it. I then opened the rind and sucked the bal- 
ance of the juice. In about twenty minutes I took 
another lemon and used it in the same manner. In 
a short time I felt very cold, as if I were lying in close 
proximity to a large mass of snow or ice. My pulse 
had dropped to 60. I shut my eyes to see if the un- 
pleasant visions were gone. I not only found that 
they were gone, but by placing my hand upon my 
head I found the pox had gone also. I laid down and 
slept two hours comfortably. I awoke, I presumed, 
from cold, although I had plenty of cover over me 
and the fire was still burning in the grate. I felt so 
well pleased that I took a little more lemon juice. I 
kept my pulse at from 60 to (>y for 36 hours, when all 
eruption and elevations had disappeared from my 
skin. I then bid good-by to lemon juice and small- 
pox. 

" So strongly am I convinced of the power of lemon 
juice to abort any and every case of small-pox, if ad- 
ministered as I administered it myself, that I look 
upon it as a specific of as much certainty and power 
in small-pox as quinine is in intermittent fever. I 



The Queen Cook Booh 26$ 

therefore publish my experiments, hoping every phys- 
ician having a case of small-pox will give it a fair 
trial and report the result to me.** 

Measles and Scarlet Fever. 

It is important to be able to readily distinguish be- 
tween these two diseases, which are in some respects 
similar. Measles presents the appearance of a patchy 
redness of a circular form, showing white between, 
with small pimples that feel like little hard points. 
The mouth and throat are red and inflamed, causing a 
cough and other symptoms of cold. About the third 
day the eyes become inflamed and watery. In spite 
of all remedies the symptoms do not abate. A day or 
two later the eruption appears upon the neck and 
head, and then extends over the rest of the body. At 
last it attacks the bowels, causing diarrhoea, and then 
the other symptoms quickly disappear. The essential 
point in the treatment is to avoid taking cold. There 
are few diseases that so readily and completely 
recover with, perfect nursing, and few that entail such 
a series of misfortunes without it. Medicine is seldom 
necessary. A portion of the body at a time may be 
sponged with warm water and then carefully wiped dry 
before extending the operation. The room should be 
well aired, but ino current of air should touch the 
patient. The food should be light and easy of diges- 
tion. 

Scarlet fever is also red, but it has a smooth feel in 
the skin, and the redness is suffused like a blush, 
which deepens till it is very red. There is loss of ap- 
petite, pains in the limbs and sore throat; this is the 
dangerous part. In scarlet fever the rash comes out 
the second day; in me asles the fourth. In scarlet 



266 Tk^ QmieMCmkB0§k 



fever, there is sore tiBfoat; none is measles. In 
scarlet fever the patient seems to have no cokl» as in 
measles. But little treatment is needed in mild cases. 
If the urine is not free, drink flax-seed tea or 
lemonade. Gargle the throat %dth red pepper, 
vinegar and water, or a solution of chlorate of potash. 
The main thing is to bring out the rash and keep it 
out. Nothing can compare with frequent warm 
baths for this purpose; or, if thene is much debility, 
warm sponge baths. Check thirst with lemonade, 
buttermilk, etc. Keep the room cod and well ven- 
tilated. Meat or poultry broth and soups may be 
given. Scarlet fever is also a disease that must mn 
its course, and the patient is to be protected by care- 
ful nursing from death, or some of the unfortunate 
complications that so frequently follow this disease.

Sulphur for Diphtheria. 

Dr. Field, of Victoria, used powdered snlphtir and a 
quill. He put one teaspoon of flour of sulphur into a 
wine glass of water and stirred it with his fii^r in- 
stead of a spoon, as the sulphiar does not readily mix 
with water. When the suljditir was well mixed he 
gave it as a gargle. Brimstone kills every species of 
fungus in man, beast and plant in a very few minutes. 
Instead of spitting out the gat^ie, he pecommeadjed 
the swallowing of it. In extreme cases, when the 
fungus was too nearly closing the throat to allow of 
the gargle, he blew the sulphur through a quill, each 
side of the throat, and after the fungus had shrunk to 
allow of it, then the gargling. 

If the patient can not gargle, take a pa» of hot 
coals and sprinkle a teaspoon of imlphur iipon t^eisu 



The' i^Heeti €00^ Book 267 

Let the jsuf erer inhale it somewhat, but not too 
strong. The patient can walk about the room inhal- 
ing the fumes. It is an excellent disinfectant of the 
room. Home Mess^fpger, 

Salt in DtPHTHEStiA. 

In a paper read at the Medical Society of Victoria, 
Australia, Dr. Day stated that, " having for many years 
regarded diphtheria, in its early stage, as a purely 
local affection, characterized by a marked tendency to 
take on putrafactive decomposition, he has trusted 
most to the free and constant application of antisep- 
tics, and when they have been used from the first, and 
been combined with nourishing food, he has seldom 
seen blood poisoning ensue. The frequent use of a 
gargle, made of a teaspoon of salt in a glass of water, 
giving children who can not gargle one or two tea- 
spoons full to djrink occasionally. Adults should use the 
gai^le as a preventive four times a day. " I should not 
cease to use other helps and send for a physician at 
once. Do not forget to use the sulphur smudge as a 
disinfectant. 

Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever. 

The following extract from a circular issued by Dr. 
James Crane of the Brooklyn Health Department, has 
important sug^stions which are equally applicable to 
city and country, wherever these diseases exist: 

Diphtheria and scarlet fever are highly contagious 
diseases, attacking persons of all ages. They must be 
contracted from persons that are already affected, 
from the clothes they have worn and from everjrthing 
which has been in the room with them. Even tl» 
walte of the ndont may infect persons coining into it 



268 The Queen Cook Book 

after the patient has recovered, unless the poison is de^ 
stroyed. In order to prevent their spread in a family 
or house where they exist and to promote the recovery 
of the persons attacked, the following simple measures 
should be conscientiously and rigidly carried out, 
thereby preventing much suffering and saving human 
life: An upper, sunny room, provided, if possible, 
with an open fireplace, and with no other children on 
the same floor, should be arranged for the patient by 
removing everything from it which can possibly be 
spared, such as books, clothing and window curtains, 
remembering that when once the patient has entered 
the room nothing can with safety be removed until dis- 
infected or fumigated. One or two adults should take 
entire charge of the patient, under no circumstances 
coming in contact with other persons, more especially 
children. Open windows and open fireplaces, with 
fire in them day and night, avoiding draughts and 
chilly air, protect the sick and those who nurse them. 
Nothing should be removed from the room when the 
patient has once entered it until it has been thoroughly 
disinfected or fumigated. 

Procure from a drug store one pound of sulphate of 
zinc; the price should not exceed thirty cents. Put 
into an ordinary water pail eight tablespoonsful of sul- 
phate of zinc and four of common salt, and to this add 
one gallon of boiling water. This disinfecting solution 
is to be kept in the room, and into it should be placed 
and kept for one hour every article of soiled clothing, 
bedding, handkerchiefs, etc. When they are removed 
from this they should be put into boiling water before 
being washed. The dishes and spoons used by the 
patient should be put into boiling water before they 
are permitted to leave the room. Remember that 
every article which is in the room can convey the 



The Queen Cook Booh a€9 

disease and that nothing should go from it until the 
poison which it might carry is destroyed. 

See that the whole house from cellar to attic is 
clean. Keep the cellar dry, well ventilated and well 
whitewashed. Never allow, even for a day, garbage or 
other filth to be kept in it. Open the windows of 
sleeping rooms every day for as long a time as possi- 
ble, fresh air being an excellent disinfectant. 

Sulphur in Scarlet Fever. 

Thoroughly annoint the patient twice daily with sul- 
phur ointment; give five to ten grains of sulphur 
stirred in molasses three times a day. Sufficient sul» 
phur was burned twice daily on hot coals to fill the 
room with the fumes, and of course was thoroughly 
inhaled by the patient. Under this mode of treatment 
each case improved immediately, and none were over 
eight days in making a complete recovery, and I firmly 
believe in each it was prevented from spreading by the 
treatment adopted. One case was in a large school. 
Having had a large experience in scarlet fever last 
year and this, I feel some confidence^ in my own judg- 
ment, and am of the opinion that the mildest cases I 
ever saw do not do half so well without as bad cases 
do with the sulphur treatment; and as far as I can 
judge, sulphur is as near a specific for scarlet fever as 
possible. 

Dr, Henry Pigeon^ in London Lancet, 

I have copied these remedies or helps (from good 
authority) for these contagious diseases, not to take 
the place of a physician, by no means, but only as 
helps when a physician is not at hand. Always send 
for the most experienced one, immediately, that you 
may know just what the disease is and take it in 
time.

Disinfectants. 

Dr. Doremus, of New York, says that to insure the 
destruction of germs of contagious diseases that chlo- 
ride of zinc is the most efficient agent, and must be 
used freely and constantly, and in direct contact with 
the water and air which are connected with the sewers 
either through closets, sinks, or wasTistands. Saucers 
of wet chloride of lime should be placed in every room, 
where a house has a contagious disease, also the sul- 
phur smudge as recommended above. 

Typhoid Fever. 

Dr. Guillasse, of the French navy, reports that in 
the early stages of the disease, coffee is almost a spe- 
cific against typhoid fever. He gives to adults two or 
three tablespoons of strong coffee every two hours, 
alternating with one or two teaspoons of claret or Bur- 
gundy wine. The beneficient effect is immediate. A 
little lemonade or citrate of magnesia should be given 
daily, and after a while quinine. 

Sciatic and Neuralgic Pains. 

Dr. Ehrard, of Nimes, states " that he has for many 
years treated all his cases of sciatic and neuralgic 
pains with a sufficiently hot flat-iron to vaporize the 
strong vinegar that a woolen cloth has been wet in, 
and placed over the hot flat-iron, applied at once to 
the painful spot. The application may be repeated 
two or three times a day. As a rule, the pain disap- 
pears in twenty-four hours, and recovery ensues at 
once." 

A friend of mine found relief in a few days from 
sciatic pains, by being rubbed freely with " Radway's 



The Qwten C&at Bovk tji 

Ready ReKef/* atnd then with ^ StaffcH-d's Olive Tar," 
then pin tightly a large bandage of double flannel (pre- 
viously put under him), around the hips. Three times 
daily. 

A Simple Remedy for Cholera. 

Dr. Henry B. Cooper prescribes this remedy for 
cholera: " One ounce of camphor should be dissolved 
in six ounces of spirits of wine, and a small bottle 
should be given to any intelligent person who will un- 
dertake to administer it to his poor neighbors, when 
they are seized with cholera or any of its symptoms. 
The following instructions should be carried out at the 
same time with the utmost care and attention to de- 
tail. On the app^rance of any cholera symptoms 
such as vodniting, purging, sudden weakness, coldness, 
cramps or spasma, instead of administering brandy, 
whisky or any other kind of medicine, put the patient 
to bed, after patting £e6t and hands in hot water, 
covering him warmly with blankets. Administer (for 
an adult) at omce, two drops (not more) of the cam- 
phor mixture on a little powdered sugar in a teaspoon 
of cold or iced water. Five minutes after let him take 
a second dose of two dkops m the same way, and in 
five minutes moi?e a third dose. He can then wait 
ten or fifteen minutes to see whether or not there is a 
sense of returning warmth, with any signs of perspi- 
ration^ and manifest cfecrease of sickness to the 
stomach, cramps, etc. If the improvement is not 
satisfactory, take two drxi^. more as; before, and repeat 
every five minutes, until fourteen drops have been 
taken. In administering the remedy particular cau- 
tion must be observed, that the patient be not allowed 
to take anything of any sort or kind while the medi- 



272 Tke Quem Cook Book 

cine is operating, or its effect wiU be destroyed, for 
the least foreign medicine neutralizes the camphor, 
which is given to check vomiting and to produce a 
free, warm perspiration. The use of cold iced water 
is advisedly recommended, as it promotes free per- 
spiration and the discharge of bile. The patient 
must not be allowed to rise and become exposed to 
slightest degree of cold, and should not be tormented 
with baths, steamings, or rubbings of any kind, but 
be permitted to lie still, as he will fall asleep when 
perspiration comes on. After some hours he will 
awake well, although weak and languid and may be 
a little feverish, in which case he may take a teaspoon 
of rhubarb syrup, with a little peppermint sling. 
Above all, he must be kept perfectly quiet, taking 
mutton broth and then light nourishing food." 

Rev. Arthur T. Pierson, D. D., after visiting Siam, 
says: " Dr. Samuel R. House, so long in Siam, 
told me he seldom lost a case of cholera when 
called before the stage of collapse, and his sole 
remedy \vas spirits of camphor." As the main 
object is to get up a natural action in the system 
and cause the nausea to cease, it looks reasonable. A 
mustard plaster on the stomach and bowels is an 
excellent thing to settle the stomach. It is recom- 
mended to burn a sulphur stick on a pan of coals, the 
size of a hickory nut (break it fine), three or four 
times a day, with open windows and doors, as a disin- 
fectant. This is good also for tubercular affections of 
the lungs, for man and beast. Saucers of chloride of 
lime should stand in the room.

To Extract a Piece of Needle or Glass from 

THE Foot or Hand. 

Bind on hand as soon as possible a slice of well 
salted fat pork (fresh jpiece) every night and morning, 
until you find it on the pork. I once had the smallest 
point of a needle in the ball of my foot. It was twenty- 
four hours before I could make the application of salt 
pork wet with the brine. Just twenty-four hours after 
the first application, as it was removed for the 
third piece, I found the needle point on the pork. 
This is equally affective for injury by a nail or a piece 
of iron, or a sprained ankle or wrist. Bathe the parts 
first with spirits of turpentine; then bind it on tight. 
Many a sore and wound has been cured by bathing in 
strong green tea and a plaster of Dalley's ointment. 
But with any of these applications you must keep the 
foot up in a chair. 

A Mustard Plaster. 

Mix a paste of flour and warm water so stiff it will 
not run off of cloth, lay the cloth on a plate, spread 
the paste the size you need, sift the mustard over it 
very sparingly. Wet a double piece of new sheer mus- 
lin and lay carefully over the mustard. Sprinkle it 
very wet with very hot water, put it on and cover with 
flannel. Leave it on ten or fifteen minutes as they can 
bear it. Be careful not to draw a blister. 

Mustard Poultice. 

A mustard poultice should never make a blister. If 
a blister is wanted there are other plasters far better 
than mustard, as it is the sorest kind of blister. Mix 
the mustard with the whites of eggs, use no water and 



274 ^^ Queen Cook Book 

« 

the result will be a plaster that will " draw '* perfectly, 
but will not produce a blister, even upon the skin of 
an infant, no matter how long it is allowed to remain.

To Make Lime Water. 

Put a few lumps of unslacked lime in a jar, slowly 
slack it with boiling water, stir it well. Let it settle 
over night, when clear bottle. Use from two to three 
tablespoons to a goblet of milk. 

Chronic Diarrhcea. 

A teaspoon of wheat flour mixed into a cup of sweet 
milk with a little nutmeg grated into it. Take it cold 
and raw. Pour a little milk on the flour at a time, 
beat it well so that it foams. To be taken three or 
four times a day. Home Messenger.

I have known of persons being cured of neuralgia by

In Case of Accident. 

A good memory well stored with self possession in 
emergencies, enables a person to relieve suffering and 
often to save life. One who faints at the appaarasce

of danger or becomes excited or confused is well nigh 
useless. A clear brain and strong will can do much 
toward overcoming physical weakness. It is especially 
important that mothers should school themselves in 
self control and learn what should be done in times of 
sudden sickness or accident, which occur more or less 
in every home. 

For dust or any foreign substance in the eye avoid 
rubbing; lie on the back with head low, drop sweet 
milk in the corner of the eye and wink it in, repeat if 
necessary.. If this does not wash it out, whether cin- 
ders or eyelashes, take a handglass to the light, and 
lift the lid, take the point of a lead pencil with a thin, 
wet cloth over it, and touch it; the substance will cling 
to it. 

Ear. 

Remove hardened wax from the ear with warm 
water: Use a syringe. Use no hard instrument. 

A Cut. 

If an artery is cut, compress above the wound. If 
a vein is cut, compress below. 

If choked, get down upon all fours and cough. 

To Smother Fire. 

Smother fire with any woolen goods, salt, shovels 
of earth, or ashes. Water poured on burning oil, 
will only spread it and increase the danger. Before 
passing through smoke take a full breath and then stoop 
low; but if carbonic gas is suspected, walk erect. 

For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, 
lay the body flat. 



276 The Queen Cook Book 

If in the water, float on the back, with the nose ancj 
mouth projecting. Be careful not to swallow the 
water. 

To Guard Against Fire. 

Every person, who sleeps above the first floor, 
either in hotels, boarding houses, or at home, should 
be provided with a fire-escape rope, a pair of thick old 
gloves, and a large cotton bag, a strong cord run in it 
to tie it up, into which on a moment's notice, you 
could empty drawers, or trunks, or the most valuable 
of your wardrobe, or tie up your clothing in a blanket 
or sheet to throw out of window. Fasten the iron 
hook around lower bed post or some heavy article of 
furniture, and drop the other end out of the window, 
and descend with gloves on or it will tear the flesh off 
of the hands. If there are two or three persons, the 
stronger could let down the weaker, and then descend 
himself. 

Corks. 

Corks may be made air and water tight by keeping 
them for five minutes in melted parafine. 

Is Alum Poisonous. 

Alum is used by many bakers to whiten their bread, 
enabling them to use an inferior flour. It is more ex- 
tensively employed as a cheap substitute for cream of 
tartar in the manufacture of baking-powders. It has 
not been considered immediately dangerous, although 
if continued it induces dyspepsia and osbtinate con- 
stipation. We Sire in entire sympathy with the manu- 
facturers of the Royal Baking Powder — ^who com- 



The Queen Ceek Beeh %fj 

m«nced and are vigorougly conducting the war against 
the use of alum in baking-powders. We prefer tke 
Royal Bakiag Powder. 

Adulterations. 

We can not be too strongly warned against the 
adulterations of food. 



WHAT PEOPLE EAT. 

Boston, Jan. 8. — Mr. Geo. T. Angell read a paper 
before the American Social Science Association here 
to-day on " Public Health Associations,** in which he 
made some startling assertions about the adulteration 
of food. He said: 

Cayenne pepper is adulterated with red lead; mus- 
tard with chromate of lead; curry powder with red 
lead, vinegar with sulphuric acid, arsenic and corro- 
sive sublimate. It is stated that probably half the 
vinegar now sold in our cities is rank poison. One of 
our Boston chemists analyzed 12 packages of pickles 
put up by 12 different wholesale dealers, and found 
copper in 10 of them. Many of our flavoring oils, 
syrups, jellies and preserved fruits contain poisons. 
The adulterations of tea are too numerous to men- 
tion. Coffee is not only adulterated, but a patent has 
been taken out for molding chicory into the form of 
coffee berries, and I am told that clay is now molded, 
and perhaps flavored with an essence to represent 
coffee. Cocoa and chocolate are adulterated with 
various mineral substances. 

Several mills in New England, and probably many 
elsewhere, are now engaged in grinding white stone 



37t TAr Omen C&ok Amik 

into a fine powder for purposes oi adulteratioo. At 
some of these mills they griaid three grades — ^soda 
grade, sugar grade, and flour grade. It sells for about 
half a cent a pound. Flour has been adulterated in 
England, and probably here, with plaster of Paris, 
bone dust, sand, clay, chalk, and other articles. I am 
told that large quantities of damaged and unwhole- 
some grain are ground in with flour, partioulaply "with 
that kind called graham flour. Certainly hundreds, 
and probably thousands, of bushels of " terra alba,*' or 
white earth, arc sold in our cities fivery year to be 
mixed with sugars in confectionery and other white 
substances. I am told by an eminent {^ysiciafi that 
this tends to produce stone, kic^y complaints, and 
various diseases of the stomach. A Boston chemist 
tells me that he has found 7 5 per cent, of " terra 
alba ** in what was sold as cream of tartar used for 
cooking. A large New York house sells three grades 
of cream of tartar. A Boston chemist recently ana- 
lyzed a sample of the best grade, and found 50 per 
cent, of " terra alba *' in that. Much of our confec- 
tionery contains 33 per cent, or more of " terra alba." 
The coloring matter of confectionery frequently con- 
tains lead, mercury, arsenic and copper. Baking- 
powders are widely sold which contain a large per- 
centage of " terra alba '' and alum. 

It is not water alone that is mixed with milk. 
Thousands of gallons, and probably hundreds of thous- 
ands, are sold in our cities which have passed through 
large tins, or vats, in which it has been mixed with 
various substances. Receipts for the mixture, can be 
bought by new milkmen from old, on pxayment of the 
required sum. I am assured, on what I believe to be 
reliable authority, that thousands of galions of so- 
cailed milk have been, and probably are, sold in tUs 



The Queen Cook Book 279 

city which do not contain one drop of the genuine 
article. Large quantities of the meats of animals 
more or less diseased are sold in our markets. Cows 
in the neighborhood of our large cities are fed upon 
material which produces a large flow of unwholesome 
milk. Poultry are fed upon material which produces 
unwholesome eggs. Meats and fish are made un- 
wholesome, frequently poisonous, by careless and 
cruel methods of killing. A California chemist recently 
analyzed many samples of whisky, purchased at dif- 
ferent places in San Francisco. He found them adul- 
terated with creosote, salts of copper, alum and other 
injurious substances. He states it, in his published 
report, as his opinion that there is hardly any pure 
whisky sold in that city. A gentleman recently pur- 
chased from a prominent Boston firm a cask of pure 
sherry wine for his sick wife. His wife grew worse. 
He had the wine analyzed, and found there was not a 
drop of the juice of the grape in it; An eminent med- 
ical gentleman of Bqgton said to me:' " The adulter- 
ations of drugs and spices in this country are perfectly 
abominable.*' I say that laws should be enacted and 
enforced prohibiting the manufacture and sale of these, 
poisonous and dangerous articles, under severe penal- 
ties, and compelling the manufacturers and sellers of 
adulterated articles to tell buyers the precise character 
of the adulterations. 

Neither can too much be said against the candies 
known as "rock and rye.'* Upon being analyzed 
two pounds of the candy contained enough fusel oil for 
a fatal dose. A smaller quantity produces dizziness, 
headache, sense of falling and suffocation. This 
should be explained to school children and to our own. 
Will not some honest manufacturer arise and expose 
the secrets of a business that is doing untold mischief 
to our childreu ?

HINTS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD. 

To purify the room of unpleasant odors, pour vine^ 
gar on a hot brick or burn sugar or coffee on coals. 

To remove a tight finger-ring hold hand in very cold 
water a few minutes and rub on soft soap. 

When a coal fire gets low throw on some salt. It 
will help it very much. 

When cooking onions set a tin-cup of vinegar on 
the stove and let boil and no disagreeable odor will be 
in the room. 

Gold jewelry washed in ammonia water with a 
brush will look nearly equal to new. It is excellent to 
take grease from carpets and clothes. 

To remove stains of ink, fruit, wine, mildew, etc.^ 
one teblespoofi of lemon juice, one tablespoon of pure 
cream 6f tartar, one teaspoon of oxalic acid, half a 
pint of rain water. Wipe off with clear water any ar- 
ticle that can not be Washed^ after using the mixture, 
or it will eat the fabric. 

Borax water will heal all chapping of hands or lips 
and remove all stains from the hands. Dissolve the 
borax in hot water, bottle, keep a bowl of it weakened 
on the washstand; rinse your hands in it after washing. 

If frying fat gets too hot, drop in two or three slices 
of raw potato or bread. 

Felon. 

Common rock salt mixed with spirits of turjpentine 
in equal parts placed on a cloth and applied to the af- 
fected part, removing the application as often as it 
dries, for twenty-four hours, it is said will effect a cure. 

The quickest way to relieve burns caused by fire or 
§team is to Qover the surfage with b?iking soda till a 



The Queen Cook Book 281 

preparation of equal parts of linseed oil and lime 
water can be applied with soft cloths. For a slight 
burn brush over with the white of an egg and cover 
with a cloth spread with pure lard. To a burn result- 
ing from lime, lye or any alkali, apply vinegar or lemon 
juice. Burn from an acid, oil of vitriol or aquafortis, 
apply water instantly and immediately follow with ap- 
plications of moist earth. 

Bruises. 

All bruises should be immediately bathed with very 
hot water to prevent swelling and lessen discoloration. 

Convulsions. 

Convulsions are not infrequent with young children 
and while teething. Take off the child's clothing 
and immerse it to the neck in as warm water as it can 
bear, apply cold water to the head with a cloth, very 
cold. The muscles will usually relax soon, when the 
child should be wiped dry with hot towels, wrapped 
warm and placed in bed. If produced by undigested 
food give an emetic, if by constipation give a clyster. 

Soft Bed. 

Why should soft beds be considered unhealthy.^ 
Certainly they afford more comfort than hard ones. 
Hard beds should never be given to little children, 
and parents who suppose that such beds contribute to 
health by hardening and developing the constitutions 
are surely in. error. Eminent physicians both here 
and in England concur in this opinion, and state that 
hard beds have often proved injurious to the shape of 
infants. To a weary one there is nothing restful in a 



282 The Queen Cook Book 

hard bed. Birds and animals cover their offspring 
with the softest material they can obtain, and also 
make soft beds for them. Why not take lessons from 
them. 

Brick Walks. 

If you have brick walks becoming grey and mossy, 
scrub and scrape them clean, then sprinkle with Ven- 
etian red and scour it in with a broom. 

There are many dangerous household liquids, such 
as benzine, ether, ammonia, oxalic acid and others, 
which should be kept under lock and key. These are 
used for cleaning various articles. 

Antidote for Poison. 

A poison of any conceivable description and degree 
of potency which has been swallowed by accident or 
not, may be rendered almost instantaneously harmless 
by swallowing two gills of sweet oil. An individual with 
a very strong constitution should take twice the quan- 
tity. The oil will neutralize every form of vegetable 
or mineral poison with which physicians are acquainted. 
Follow with emetics of a teaspoon of mustard and one 
of salt; repeat if necessary. 

Antidotes for Poison. 

If any poison is swallowed, drink immediately a half 
glass of tepid water with a heaping teaspoon each 
of salt and ground mustard. This vomits as soon as 
it reaches the stomach, but for fear that some of the 
poison may still remain, swallow the white of one or 
two eggs, or drink a cup of strong coffee — ^these two 
being antidotes for a greater number of poisons than 
any other dozen articles known, with the advantage of 



The Queen Cook Book 283 

their always being at hand. For oil of vitriol or aqua- 
fortis, give large doses of magnesia and water. For 
ammonia, give vinegar freely or lemon juice. For 
oxalic acid, give magnesia or soda, dissolved in water, 
administered in large and frequently repeated doses> 
and some soothing drink. This is good for all acids. 
Acids cause great heat and sensation of burning pain 
from the mouth down to the stomach. For poisons 
of alkalies, best remedy is vinegar. For saltpeter an 
emetic of salt and mustard, one teaspoon of each 
in cup of tepid water, if not sufficient, repeat; after- 
ward, gum arabic solution and small doses of lauda- 
num, according to age; this should be directed by the 
physician: For opium or laudanum, give the mustard 
emetic freely, then strong coffee and acids, dash cold 
water on the head. Keep them in constant motion by 
walking, or if too weak to walk, keep them awake by 
shaking and slapping. They must not be allowed to 
sleep for ten or twelve hours; give strong coffee. For 
arsenic the mustard emetic, then the beaten whites of 
three eggs, lime water, or magnesia; but the freshly 
prepared hydrated oxide of iron is best, as soon as it 
can be procured, with directions. For corrosive sub- 
limate, give whites of eggs freely mixed with water 
until free vomiting takes place, or give wheat flour and 
water freely. Creosote, mustard emetic and white of 
eggs. Belladona (night henbane), give emetics and 
then plenty of water and vinegar or strong lemonade. 
Mushrooms, when poisonous, give emetics and then 
plenty of vinegar and water, with doses of ether. 
Nitrate of silver (lunar caustic), give a strong solution 
of common salt and then emetics. Nux vomica, first 
emetics, then brandy. Tartar emetic, give large 
doses of tea made of galls, peruvian bark or white 



284 The Queen Cook Book 

Poison Oak, Ivy, etc. 

Dilute sweet spirits of nitre with the same quantity 
of water; apply with a cloth every ten minutes until 
cured. When applied immediately it seldom needs 
more than one application. Fine table salt in solu- 
tion is an excellent remedy, also sweet oil. An excel- 
lent antidote is to take a handful of quick lime, dissolve 
in water, let stand for an hour, then paint the 
poisoned places with it. Three or four applications 
will cure. All poisonous stings can be . instantly 
arrested, by the application of equal parts of common 
salt and bicarbonate of soda, well rubbed in on the 
places bitten or stung. 

The Only Antidote for Whisky and Tobacco. 

Look at all its evils, ask God's help; make a firm 
resolution to use it no more and keep it. 

Whitewash That Will Not Rub Off. 

To half a pail of lime and water, take half a pint 
of flour, make a starch of it and stir it in well. 

To Mend China. 

Take liquid glue and stir into it plaster of pans un-* 
til the mixture is of proper consistency. Rub the 
edges well, tie it tightly for three days, or hold it, 
pressing firmly till dry. 

The Best Washing Fluid 

2J^ pounds sal soda J^ pound borax 

% pound lime unSlacked 2 ounces salts of tartar 

I Ji ounces liquid ammonia 4 gallons cold water 

Dissolve the soda and borax in two quarts of hot 
water. Settle and when clear pour it off carefully. 
Pour the solution together and the cold water. 



The Queen Cook Book ^^S 

Keep it in keg. The night before washing, take six 
tablespoons to four pails warm water; put in clothes, 
soak over night; next morning add hot water enough 
to wash the clothes with good soap suds. Boil the 
clothes ten minutes, and wash as usual. One trial of 
.this fluid will show its good effects. 

* To Clean 3lack Kid Gloves. 

"Put a few drops of black ink to a teaspoon of sweet 
oil, rub in with small cloth and dry in the sun. 

To Clean Gloves. 

Gloves slightly soiled can be cleaned by placing 
glove on hand, wet a piece clean flannel with benzine, 
and wipe the stained part very lightly and carefully. 
Do not rub but wipe it gently from the tips of the 
fingers toward the wrist. 

A ripe tomato will remove ink stains from the hands 
or from paper or linen. 

Grass Stains on White Goods. 

Wet the fabric in suds and some soda in it, let 
stand half an hour, and wash. 

^ To Wash Lawn, Muslin or any Color that Fades. 

Bring to a boil four quarts of bran-middlings, in two 

I pails of water, strain and mix in water, wash, using no 

soap, put a little of the bran water in rinsing water,

To Renew Wrinkled Crape. 

Cover a board about twelve inches wide with cloth, 
stretch the crape on it round and round perfectly 
smooth and tight. Hold it over boiling water, shift- 
ing as the steam 'penetrates it. Lay a heavy weight 
on it to dry. If a good quality of crape, it will look 
as good as new. 

To Starch Black Dresses. 
Add a cup of strong coffee to very weak starch. 

To Clean Black Cashmere Goods. 

Let soak over night in luke warm strong borax 
water. Squeeze it through the hands as you would 
yam; then take out and hang on line to drip, when 
nearly dry, press on wrong side. Do not rinse or 
wring. 

Ammonia water is good to renovate a black chip 
hat. One teaspoon, to one pint cold water. 

To Clean Chamois Skins. 

Put to soak for two hoxirs in warm water, with a lit- 
tle soda and soft soap suds. Then wash, and rinse it 
well in a weak solution of soda and hard soap in warm 
water. It must not be put in clear water as it makes 
it hard. 

Striped or Colored Table Linen. 

Wash in borax water, put two tablespoons df salt 
in rinsing water. 



The Queen Cook Book 287 



Lace Curtains. 

Soak over night in warm soap suds, squeeze through 
two waters; boil in weak borax water, suds and rinse, 
handle very carefully, do not wring but only squeeze. 
Starch, pin sheets on carpet and pin the curtains 
down or dry them on curtain frames. Wring out of 
starch with clothes-wringer. 

To Wash White Flannels. 

A good laundress will wash flannels with warm water 
and hard soap without shrinking. Use one-fourth of 
a cake of hard soap (shave it up and dissolve in hot 
water the night previous) to three pails of hot water. 
Put some of this suds in rinsing water after dissolving 
two tablespoons of powdered borax in both waters. 
Clear water leaves the flannels hard. Wring very 
dry; shake, pull and stretch well. Press them when 
dry. 

How TO Relieve Rheumatism. 

Put away sheets and counterpane and sleep in 
blankets, under and over. The sheets and cotton 
spread do a great deal of mischief. The cotton keeps 
the sour heat- and perspiration from the body in the 
bed, and so you breathe poisoned air all night, sum- 
mer and wmter, which makes the rheumatism worse. 
Blankets do not absorb the perspiration. Selected. 

Relief for Burning Feet. 

First discard tight boots; then take one pint of bran 
and one ounce of bi-carbonate of soda and put it in the 
foot-bath with one gallon of hot water. When cool 
enough, soak your feet in this mixture for fifteen min- 



28S The Queen Cook Book 

utes; then rub olf well all the dead skin. Repeat thi^^ 
until cured, every other night for eight or ten times. 
After the first bath the same water will do for three 
times. The burning sensation is produced by the 
pores of the skin being closed so that the feet do not 
perspire. 

Asthma. 

Take one-half ounce of hydrate potassa, put it into 
a pint of water, and take a teaspoon two or three times 
a day. Viola.

Malady of the Stobiach. 

The wife of Pere Hyacinthe, in her counsel and 
encouragement to the women workers in the temper- 
ance work says, " The great American malady is 
the malady of the stomach. Bear in mind this fact, 
that the appetite for drink is not necessarily made by 
drinking, but in nine cases out of ten it is created and 
cultivated at your tables — in the children by the use of 
strong tea and coffee, or pepper, pickles, mustard, 
spices, too much salt pork, hot bread and pastry, raw 
meat and grease, and above all by the use of tobacco. 
The cry of a depraved appetite, an inflamed stomach, 
is always for something stronger. In short reform 
your tables if you would reform your drunkards and

save your sons.'* When people feel the need of 
an acid, if they would let vinegar alone and use 
lemonade or apples they would feel as well satisfied 
and receive no injury. 

Earache. 

Children frequently suffer greatly with earache. I 
would not advise dropping anything into the ear, as I 
have known of one person who lost entirely the hear- 
ing of that ear for life. Tobacco smoke will often 
afford great relief. Fill the bowl of a pipe half full of 
fine tobacco, place a piece of thin muslin over the 
bowl, insert the stem or hold it to the ear and blow in 
the smoke, or if you are where you can obtain it, 
place a piece of cotton wool saturated with chloroform 
in the bowl of a pipe and blow gently, holding the 
stem in the ear; the evaporating chloroform will relieve 
the pain immediately. Then apply at once a bag of 
hops wet or moistened with very hot water to the ear; 
bind it on and cover them warm in bed. Put the 
hops in sheer muslin, and you will sleep all night. 
If there are no hops, roast onions, put in thin bag and 
bind on hot. 

How TO Take out a Cancer. 

A Milwaukee paper states that some eight years ago 
Mr. T. B. Mason, of that city, ascertained that he had 
a cancer on his face the size of a pin. It was cut out 
by Dr. Wolcott, and the wound partially healed. 
Subsequently it grew again, and while he was in Cin- 
cinnati on business, it attained the size of a hickory 
nut. He remained there under treatment and is now 
perfectly cured. The process is this: A piece of 
sticking plaster was put over the cancer, with a cir« 



290 The Queen Cook Book 

cular piece cut out of the center a little larger than the 
cancer, so that the cancer and a small circular rim of 
the healthy skin next to it were exposed. Then a 
()laster made of chloride of zinc, bloodroot, and wheat 
flour was spread on a piece of muslin, the size of this 
circular opening, and applied to the cancer for twenty- 
four hours. On removing it, the cancer will be found 
burst into and appear of the color and hardness of an 
old shoe sole, and the circular rim outside of it will 
appear white and parboiled, as if scalded by hot 
steam. The wound is now dressed, and the outside 
rim soon separates, and the cancer comes out in a 
hard lump, and the place heals up. The plaster kills 
the cancer, so that it sloughs out like dead flesh, and 
never grows again. This remedy was discovered by 
Dr. Fell, of London, and has been used by him many 
years with unfailing success, and not a case has been 
known of the reappearance of the cancer when this 
remedy has been applied. Note: — As the quantities 
are not given it would be best to consult a good 
physician and he give you the proportions, and care 
for it till it is healed. Keep still till healed. See cure 
for wounds. Perhaps this is painful. Let the doctor 
take charge.

For Tape Worm. 

First be sure you have one, as pieces will pass from 
you, which is the surest evidence. Fast, and eat 
nothing for twenty-four hours. Then take a pint of 
shelled pumpkin seeds, chop fine, and mix in common 
molasses enough to make it eatable, eat it all at once. 
Twelve hours after, take one and a half tablespoons 
of castor oil. Eat nothing till the oil operates, ex- 
cept a little coffee once or twice with two mouthf uls 



The Queen Cook Book 291 

of bread. This will cost a struggle of two days; eat 
lightly after it, at first. Two cases are positively 
known to have been cured by this process. 

Frozen Hands or Feet. 

Put them in very cold water or rub them with snow. 
Frozen ears also. 

Tar Cordial. 
Is excellent for a cough. 

Water Bugs and Roaches. 

Powdered borax sprinkled on the floor or in the 
chinks which they frequent, is said to clear them out. 
If it does not, hellebore will; mix it with double the 
quantity of oat meal, adding a little sugar, strew it 
where they run, but take it up in the morning, if chil- 
dren or servants are around, and put it down at night 
again, as it is a deadly poison. 

To Rid a House of Punkies. 

If two or three little dishes of household ammonia 
are set in their places of resort, they will soon leave. 

Flies. 

The only way to keep out file's, is to have window 
and door screens, darken. the room from nine A. M. 
to five p. M. and have no eatables or smells around. 

Moths. 

I have for many years used camphor gum as a pre- 
ventive against moths, and it has never failed, either 



29^ The Queen Cook Book 

in furs, woolens or feathers. All goods must be shook 
and brushed clean from all dust, all spots cleaned. 
Cover all goods with newspapers, putting in each 
package a piece of camphor (cutting it in squares) as 
large as a large hickory nut in each package and one 
in each end of trunk or box, doing it up tightly in 
paper. This will last all summer. Everything else 
has failed. 

Buffalo Moths. 

The state entomologist recommends benzine for 
the extirpation of the grub, which usually begins its 
ravages in the middle of April. It is a hairy worm- 
like larvae scarcely half an inch long, which easily 
hides in the fuzz of the carpet, or in any woolen 
article, or even in trunks. The beetle is never found 
about the house except during the short period when 
it is laying its eggs in summer. It feeds on the pollen 
of the spirea and other plants and never touches car- 
pets. The grub alone feeds on carpets, woolens, 
furs, etc. 

Black Ants. 

Crush them as fast as you can just as you find them 
and let theni lie just where you killed them, the next 
morning you will look in vain for their carcasses, as 
during the night their brethren have carried them 
off. They will not return to that city of destruction 
again for the summer, perhaps never. 

Creeping Charlie. 

To arrange " creeping Charlie '* to grow luxuriantly 
in a vase, place some broken pieces of charcoal in the 
bottom of vase, with some beach sand on it to the 



The Queen Cook Book 293 

depth of two inches; place the stems of the plant in 
this sand and fill the vase with water. Set it in the 
coolest corner of the room. 

Pressing Leaves and Flowers. 

Always press Howers between soft papers such as 
newspapers, as soon as possible after picking. Stiff 
paper will not absorb the dampness; open them every 
day to dry and see that they are not shoved any. 



PLANTS. ' 

Plants that you desire for the house for the winter, 
should be slipped in the summer for potting in the 
middle of September. Small pots are best for bloom- 
ing. Put in rich soil, with powdered charcoal mixed 
in the soil will give rich dark green leaves and brilliant 
coloring to the flowers. Pot the plants in September 
and bring them in about two weeks before requiring 
fires. Use liquid manure, very weak, once a week. 
Stirring the top soil once a week is very good especi- 
ally for roses. Plants are very much like children, 
will thrive and reward us according to the loving ten- 
der care they receive, or the abuse and neglect. 
Plants packed away in cellars that are quite dark will 
require very little water once a week, according to 
dryness of cellar. Do not allow gas to escape in the 
cellar, as it is dangerous both to plants and people. 

Wall Roses. 

Make a two feet deep border of strong loam, four or 
five feet wide, to be as rich as rotten manure can 
make it; the border to be thoroughly soaked with soft 



294 ' Tte Qnem Cook Bc^k 

water twice a week in dry weather, and when the 
roses are in bloom, to keep them thin in the branches 
as if they were peach trees and to play the water 
engine against them as for a house on fire, from the 
first appearance of insects tiU no more come. There 
is a reason for everything nnder the sun, and the 
reason for insects attacking roses in general and those 
on walls more particularly, is from too much dryness 
at the roots causing the juices to be more palatable 
through the action of the leaves. 

Worms at the Roots of Plants. 

Sprinkle soot over the top of the ground around 
them. For angle worms in house plants insert in the 
mold a long sharp hair pin or wire, and then pour 
lime water upon the soil, it will cause the worms to 
come -to the top and crawl off. 

For Insects on Rose Bushes and Small Fruits. 

To destroy the insects strew the ground around 
them with air slacked lime under the bushes in early 
spring. 

Currant Worms. 

Take one large teacup of powdered white hellebore, 
at the first appearance of the worms, to a pail of 
warm water and syringe with it. This will kill the 
worms all off, but in ten days another lot will be 
hatched out, which should be dealt with as before. I 
have used this ever since the worm appeared and it 
has never failed. 



The Queen Cook Book . 295 

Carbolic Acid for Insects. 

Obtain crude carbolic acid, use it in this form be- 
cause it is stronger and better for the purpose and 
costs, but very little. Two or three tablespoons of 
acid to a quart of domestic soft soap may first be 
tried. Stir well together, and let stand for a few 
hours. Then test the compound by mixing a little of 
it with soft water. If too much acid, oily particles of 
carbolic acid will be floating on the surface. More 
soap should be added to balance the excess of acid. 
Some soaps are stronger than others, so no definite 
rule can be given. Make as strong with acid as the 
soap will perfectly cut. The refined acid may be used 
when the crude is not at hand. When prepared as 
above, make a moderately strong suds and apply with 
syringe, or turn up the bush and sprinkle with a 
broom. In using on delicate plants, make it weaker 
and rinse off after a few minutes. 

Grape Mildew and Curculio. 

To one part sulphur add two parts lime unslacked 
with about two thousand times their bulk of boiling 
water. Let it stand forty-eight hours, draw off the 
clear liquor and apply with a common garden pump. 

The Apple Worm. 

After the worm has entered the fruit and accom- 
plished its damage, the time arrives when it has to 
leave the fruit and hide itself in a quiet secure position 
to undergo the transition from the larva to the pupa 
state, which requires, in the early part of the season, 
eight or ten days; after this time the miller is hatched 
and is again ready to besiege the fruit with its sting. 



296 The Queen Cook Book 

The insebt being two-brooded at least, if not disturbed, 
has an increased force to do mischief the second time. 
The progeny for the succeeding year have alone to 
depend on the security of this second generation of 
larvae. They may often be found under the outside 
bark of apple trees during winter. This bark should 
be thoroughly scraped off and washed in strong soft- 
soap suds. Sprinkle the ground under the tree with 
wood-ashes and then sprinkle this with water enough 
to wet the ashes. Last of June, wrap around the 
trees woolen rags about four inches wide, dip in 
either of the above preparations, or wet with helle- 
bore fluid, as directed, for currant worms. Every few 
days examine the trees, and destroy the worms secreted 
under the woolen cloth and carefully picking up and 
destroying all dropped apples, for the rest of the sum- 
mer. This is an effective remedy, but it will require 
your utmost diligence. 

Red Ants. 

Have plenty of swing shelves in pantry and cellar. 
Place sugar boxes, cereals and every thing eatable or 
sweet upon them. Wash off the shelves where you 
find them with strong spirits of camphor. Place 
lumps of camphor in corners and occasionally on 
shelf. But to keep them from the floor, put coarse, 
salt two inches deep and three inches wide next to the 
mop-board. This I have found very effectual. I have 
found little dishes of chloride of lime set around in ad- 
dition, good, for sometimes they seem desperate and 
then we have to be very thorough too. Everything 
must be very clean; not a crumb dropped around. 



The Queen Cook Book 2gj 

Ants Black and Red. 

" Having had years of trial with ants, both black 
and red, we lighted upon the following remedy, which 
with us has worked like magic. One tablespoon of 
tartar emetic, one tablespoon sugar, mixed into a thin 
syrup with water .as it evaporates or is carried oflf, 
add ingredients as needed. When the water dries up, 
fill up again; the emetic will last a long time. A 
sicker lot of pests it would be hard to find. Whether 
they impart the results to the home firm, or whether 
all are killed, I trow not; certain it is they do not pay 
us a second visit.'' 

Another to drive away red ants: — One pint of tar in 
two quarts of hot water, put in earthen dishes or tin 
covers and set where their haunts are. Some say 
powdered borax sprinkled around will drive away all 
kinds of insects. I find dry sulphur the best. Spread 
it on shelft 

To Drive off Rats and Mice. 

Rats will leave the premises if wet chloride of lime is 
spread where they run, and around and in their holes. 
Tar is good. 

Another for rats and mice: — ^Two parts well bruised 
squills, three parts of finely chopped bacon, corn 
meal to thicken. Roll thin and bake in small cakes. 
Place where they run. Sure thing. 

Bed Bugs. 

The only certain cure for bedbugs is a solution of 
corrosive sublimate, put intp the cracks and crevices, 
after the bedstead is thoroughly washed and scalded, 

where you can. If they are in the walls, smoke with

brimstone. Examine often and repeat the process 
every week if necessary. This is a deadly poison» 
therefore keep it locked up, away from servants and 
children. 

A Useful Cement. 

A good cement for mending almost anything, made 
by mixing together litharge and glycerine to the con- 
sistency of fresh putty. This cement is useful for 
mending stone jars, or any coarse earthenware, stop- 
ping leaks in seams of tin pans, washboilers, cracks 
or holes in iron kettles, to tighten loose boxes in 
wagon hubs, etc. The article mended should stand a 
few days to harden. 

Suggestions about House Puints and Insects. 

The calla lily blooms at three years, in the early 
spring. Take an ordinary earthen one-gallon, or 
more, jar, without a hole in the Jbottom, fill the jar 
within one inch from top with rich earth, in the fsdl, 
taking off all extra bulbs and rootlets, press the soil 
firmly around. The first of January bring them out 
of cellar and fill full every other day with quite warm 
water. A few drops of ammonia in the water will 
hasten their blooming. Give plenty of water, and as 
much light and sun as possible. In California they 
only bloom during the winter months; always out- 
doors in the coldest rains. The pots should be set in 
a shady corner during the months of June and July 
and be given no water except that which falls from 
the clouds. The English or German ivy will grow 
dicely if put in a bottle of water.

The Queen Cook Book 299 



Bulbs. 

Hyacinth bulbs can be planted the last of August, 
or tulips, after having been up out of ground in a dry 
place for two months. For house bloom plant in 
pots, or place in water in hyacinth glasses. Set in 
dark, dry place for two or three weeks, then give them 
plenty of light and warm water, and they will soon 
bloom. Tulips, narcissus, crocus, can be treated in 
the same way. 

Scarlet Amaryllis. 

These should be potted the first of March, in quite 
a small pot; break off about half the rootlets, and all 
the new bulbs. After flowering the bulb may remain 
in pot until the following spring, and should be kept 
pretty cool and not very moist. 

Lady Slippers. 

Collect seeds from center stalks only of double lady- 
slippers to make them double next year. 

Training of Grape Vine. 

As the method or plan of training the vine has 
much to do with the way it is pruned or trimmed I 
will say that our style is a modified Fuller process. 
We, the first year, run up one cane, the second year 
we run up two, which in the fall we cut back to two 
or three eyes, each above the surface of the soil. 
The following season we let only two canes grow, 
fruiting them this year. We use poles or stakes up to 
the fall of this year or the early spring following, when 
we put up our trellis of three wires, the first one 



300 The Queen Cook Book 

eighteen inches from the ground, and the others 
twelve or fourteen inches apart. The two canes of 
last year are now made to act as iarms, thus — y — » 
they being wound around and tied to the lower wire. 
We now let all the shoots grow, pinching back every 
other one to the second wire. In the fall the longest 
ones, or those permitted to grow unchecked, are cut 
back to within two eyes of the arm, and the others 
permitted to grow unchecked the following season as 
far as the top of the wires. One cane is also per- 
mitted to grow from each cane which was cut back, 
these being for the fruiting canes the following year — 
the others being cut back in the fall to two eyes, the 
same as the other canes the preceding fall. If the 
vine be very short jointed we have found that fruiting 
canes from every other eye was too much of a drain 
upon the vine, especially with young vines, and we 
then use only every third eye; or, to make it still more 
plain, we try to leave from four to six inches of space 
between the fruiting canes. 

About every fourth or fifth year we have found it to 
be a good plan to renew the arms, which is readily 
done by permitting a young shoot to grow near the 
base of the vine on each side for one or two seasons 
before it is wanted, when the old arm is cut away and 
the young one substituted. 

Cleaning Silver or Metal. 

Camphene oil and rotten stone give a far brighter 
polish than can be obtained by the use of other pow- 
ders. Camphene is used in producing the exquisite 
polish of the photo plates. Nothing has been found to 
equal it. 



The Queen Cook Book 301 



A Few Suggestions. 

Every good housekeeper knows the advantage of an 
early start in the morning, after having everything 
prepared to make a quick fire, and the breakfast 
planned the day before. 

After breakfast always plan for the next three meals. 

Monday morning, plan the work for the week as far 
as is necessary. Usually Monday is wash day. 

Tuesday is ironing. 

Wednesday for sweeping and dusting. 

Thursday, see that everything is washed up and 
refilled, such as sugar bowl, salt dishes, etc. 

Friday, clean pantry, cupboards and kitchen. > 

Saturday, baking for the week, and prepare, as far 
as possible, for Sunday dinner. 

Of course, many other things will step in and demand 
the attention, and all has to be done in time and anti- 
cipated, thereby avoiding much worry and confusion. 

Study your cook book as you would any other lesson, 
not only just as it is wanted, but at leisure moments. 

Keep all the groceries, cereals, etc. , in glass or tin 
cans, covered tight. 

Always keep a supply of rolled cracker on hand, 
rolling the broken ones; keep in covered jar. 

It is best to have everything ready for use when 
wanted; therefore, everything should be perfectly clean 
when put away. 

Always use a wooden spoon to stir all kinds of 
fruits and tomatoes while cooking. 

Never throw water on burning oil (as it spreads it); 
throw on flour, ashes or earth. 

Keep gasoline, kerosene and coal oil cans in the 
wood-house, and not near any food. 



302 The Queen Cook Book 

If your clothes take fire do not run about, or out of 
doors; if you can not slip them off quickly; get the 
nearest woolen goods, such as a shawl, blanket or 
carpet, overcoat, or anything to wrap around you, and 
roll on the floor to extinguish the flames. 

Use crash for dish towels or dish cloths. 

Always provide yourselves with little conveniences 
for working, such as holders, brushes, etc. Keep a 
stick with a strip of cotton cloth tied on the end of it 
to butter the baking pans. Use salt pork for griddle 
greasers. 

Purchase only the quantity of sweet potatoes you 
can use in a week, as they do not keep long. Do not 
purchase more than you can use before it spoils; you 
will soon learn the bill of fare if you really desire to be 
a helpmeet. 

Keep house on a cash basis *and do not purchase 
unless you can pay down. 

When going to housekeeping purchase steel silver- 
plated knives, as they are sharper than the white 
metal. 

Pieces of bread should be dried in heater, grated, 
and kept in tight jar ready for puddings or croquettes. 
With a little care there will not be many. 

Clean bottles with shot, soap and ashes; clean the 
shot for next time. 

Use spirits of camphor to take out fresh paint, but 
if dried on persevere with spirits of turpentine. 

To clean steel knives, cut a raw potato in two, and 
dip in brick-dust, rub hard. 

Take one teaspoon of spirits of ammonia to one cup 
of hot water, to clean coat collars, woolen goods, rusty 
silk, or spots on carpet. Good to clean silver. 

Never put new papering over old. It is very easily 
taken off by putting two or three pails of boiling hot 



The Queen Cook Book 303 

water in the closed room, as often as it stops steaming, 
till it will peel off; perhaps two days or more. Where 
it does not peel off easily take a pail of hot water soak 
paper with a cloth and scrape the wall clear of paste 
with a sharp scraper till perfectly smooth. 

Every farmer should purchase a reliable recipe book 
for his wife's next birthday, or for Christmas — which 
ever comes first — that his table may be furnished with 
nourishing food, and in such a variety as to satisfy the 
cravings of nature. What is lacking at the daily table 
is sometimes made up out of the stimulus of tobacco 
and whisky. Farmers should provide all kinds of 
fresh meats, vegetables, fruits, milk, butter, eggs and 
cereals for their own table and then raise to sell. Do 
not save them only for company. Man or woman can 
not work with profit more than ten hours a day. What 
is needed on the farm, next to plenty of sleep, is 
plenty of food and a variety on the table at all three 
of its spreads. Good sweet bread, meat, fruit, un- 
skimmed new milk, should be eaten as appetite desires, 
and not salt meat and fried potatoes, or boiled with 
the skins on, three times a day. Under the influence 
of good food and sleep, and the ten-hour law, our skel- 
eton boys and girls, whose lives are on the farm, would 
put on flesh and the bloom of youth, and would have 
some light in their eyes and some happiness in their 
hearts. Does not the farmer's wife need help in the 
kitchen, as well as help on the farm } An over 
wearied body can not keep up a cheerful heart. 

Ignorant mistresses make poor servants and receive 
poor service from what would be good material if 
properly directed. 

While princesses are taught the rules of cooking 
and dressmaking and to know how long it takes a 
woman and a broom to sweep and dust a room, there

are many daughters in our country who have felt it 
beneath them to learn the necessary duties of life, and 
when married have not known whether they were re- 
quiring impossibilities of their one servant or other- 
wise. There are so many helps nowadays that no 
beginner need be discouraged if she keeps patience 
and perseverance at her side. A cook, if such a per- 
son has any inherent capacity, can be made a good 
cook only by an intelligent mistress. Good health in 
our homes is more to be Considered than sumptuous 
upholstery, elegant dinners or expensive table service. 
A beautiful home is a comfortable one. The condi- 
tion of the mind has more influence upon the bodily 
health than is generally supposed. It is no doubt true 
that diseases of the body cause a depressing and mor- 
bid condition of the mind, but it is no less true that 
sorrowful and disagreeable emotions produce disease 
in persons who, uninfluenced by them, would be in 
sound health. Or, if disease is not produced, the 
functions are disordered. Agreeable emotions set in mo- 
tion nervous currents which stimulate the blood, brain 
and every part of the system into healthful activity; 
while grief, disappointment of feeling and brooding 
over present sorrows or past mistakes depress all vital 
forces. To be physically well one must in general be 
happy. The reverse is not always true. One may 
be happy and cheerful and yet be a constant sufferer 
in body. Let us all see that we have the free sun- 
shine of the soul in our homes. 

We and our children, as well as all plant life, need 
the full light of the sun to shine upon us daily, and its 
subtle tonic has a wonderful curative influence upon 
both our physical and mental ailments. It pierces 
into the secret corners, deodorizes the foul places, 
kills disease germs and brings life, health and joy on 



The Queen Cook Book 305 

ts beams. Let us have the lovely dancing sunlight in 
our homes. 

Let fresh air from the outside find access in all the 
sleeping rooms all the year round (except when down 
to zero). I believe there are many early graves from 
breathing foul air at night that has been breathed over 
and over again. How weak and languid one feels 
after sleeping in a closed room. Pure air and sun- 
light go far toward the making of the perfect man, 
but their action must be supplemented by that of 
plain, nutritious food to attain the best resfilts. With 
more simplicity in our homes there would be fewer 
tired, anxious faces. I will give you a sample of the 
table for one day of an intelligent lady that did her 
own work except the washing and scrubbing. 

Breakfast — White and graham bread, cold meat, 
fruit, coffee. 

Dinner — Meat, potatoes, one other vegetable, fruit 
or a very simple baked pudding. 

Tea — Bread of both kinds, fruit, cocoa. 

The problem of how to " make both ends meet '* is 
a serious one in most of households. Two things are 
very essential in the management of small resources, 
either of strength or of means; one should be very 
careful not to overdraw on either, and it is very neces- 
sary to cultivate the faculty of making the best use 
possible of what one has — to cling to the essential and 
leave the non-essentials till a convenient time. 

Industry and economy are both as essential in 
housekeeping as in any other department of life. 
Economy is simply the art of gathering up all tte 
fragments so that nothing be lost, fragments of time 
as well as of material. Nothing should be thrown away 
so long as it is possible to make use of it. For exam- 
ple: Save in a box all the twine that comes around 



3o6 The Queen Cook Book 

the packages for the house. Fold up also all the 
good wrapping paper and keep in a box or drawer, also 
all the good paper bags; they will all be found useful. 

When about to furnish a home, purchase as few 
things as possible, as it is only by experience that 
one can tell what will be the needs of that home. 
It is wise to keep an account of all one spends; this 
answers a double purpose, as it enables one to know 
whether he is living within his income, and it is also 
good for reference. 

No false pride or foolish ambition to appear just 
like some one else, should ever tempt us to live quite 
up to our income. To lay up one-sixth or one-tenth 
for an emergency is a good rule. " Economy is a 
poor man's revenue; extravagance a rich man's 
ruin.** True economy is not covetousness, or parsi- 
moniousness, which is the ruin of many an otherwise 
happy family. 

A penurious person is not a happy one, and he is 
always afraid others will be happy; when his children 
grow up, he may meet with no penurious reward, if 
brought up without the love of God in their hearts. 

Your child is not your child in the sense which it is 
commonly thought to be. It is not only connected 
with your life but with an older and wider life back of 
yours. The child is not only the outgrowth of its 
father's and mother's life, but is the latest manifesta- 
tion of a larger and wider life which circles through 
the arteries of society. A recognition of these facts 
will lead to the conclusion that your child is not a 
gift, but a loan to you, to instruct, counsel and polish 
for the Giver of Life. We are to consider that each 
child has an individuality of its own, different from 
any child that ever before existed, and our duty is to 
bring out its best capacities. " Oh, banish the tears 



The Queen Cook Book 307 

of children ! Continual rains upon the blossoms are 
hurtful.'* It is a great defect in parents not to be 
able to govern themselves. Here " let patience have 
its perfect work." Do not punish children merely be- 
cause you have the power. Scold never. Do not 
punish cruelly. 

We are glad to see that whipping, both in schools 
and at home, is being done away with by the most 
cultivated and enlightened class of people. Do not 
be impatient with a child because it made a mistake 
or met with an accident, but encourage them to try 
again. Mistakes are often our best teachers and de- 
velopers. Let the child understand this, that it be 
not discouraged. Is not the average child made to 
feel that a mistake is the worst thing that could hap- 
pen to him } This is a great fallacy. Does a mother 
require an infant to perform the feat of walking alone 
till he has learned through many failures } Or what 
teacher would expect his pupil to learn to read or to 
write without making a mistake ? The honest effort 
should be approved and encouragement given that 
will surely meet with success. 

Children need outdoor plays and work. Give them 
a little garden of theii own to care for and let them 
help you or think they do, and take an interest in all 
things that you are interested in; they can lend a 
helping hand in the dooryard or trimming up the 
dead or wayward branches of the shrubbery. Let 
them feel a sense of responsibility and proprietorship, 
which will add to their enjoyment in their work, as it 
stimulates their industry, care and self-reliance. Do 
not crowd the children's minds with too many studies. 
A daily bath for children at night in hot weather is 
quite essential to good health. Always brush the 
children's teeth after supper.

The Medicinal Value of Water. 

The human body is constantly undergoing tissue 
change. Worn-out particles are cast aside and elim- 
inated from the system, while the new are ever being 
formed, from the inception of life to its close. 

Water has the power of increasing these tissue 
changes, which multiplies the waste products, but at 
the same time they are renewed by its agency, giving 
rise to increased appetite, which in turn provides 
fresh nutriment. Persons but little accustomed to 
drinking water are liable to have the waste products 
formed faster than they are removed. Any obstruc- 
tion to the free working of natural laws at once pro- 
duces disease, which, if once firmly seated, requires 
both time and money to cure. 

People accustomed to rise in the morning weak and 
languid will find the cause in the imperfect secretion 
of wastes, which many times may be remedied by 
drinking a full tumbler of water before retiring. This 
very materially assists in the process during the night, 
and leaves the. tissues fresh and strong, ready for the 
active work of the day. 

To drink hot water is one of our best remedial 
agents. 

A hot bath on going to bed, even in the hot nights 
of summer, is a better reliever of insomnia than many 
drugs. 

Inflamed parts will subside under the continual 
poulticing of real hot water. 

Very hot water, as we all know, is a prompt checker 
of bleeding, and besides, if it is clean, as it should be, 
it aids in gterlizing wounds.

The Queen Cook Book 309 

There must ever be sympathy of occupation be- 
tween the united heads of the household. The wife 
must not feel that the husband has had no struggles at 
$ the store, office, or shop; also the husband must realize 

5 that the wife has had to endure many disappointments 

s through the day and only half the work is accom- 

plished that she anticipated. Let a note of sympathy 
I or a helping hand be extended to each other, ever ob- 

\ serving the small courtesies of life in your daily inter- 

j course. Your gains are one, your interests are one, 

i your losses are one; lay hold of the work of life cheer- 

fully, with two heads to plan, four hands to work, 
four eyes to watch, four shoulders on which shall rest 
its joys or trials. Every woman should have a 
thorough knowledge of the chemistry of foods and 
cooking, in order to understand the composition of 
substances, and the changes which they undergo, and 
also of dietetics to regulate the kind and quantity to be 
eaten. One who has studied the question for years 
says: " Not only the age and occupation, but also the 
individuality of the person play an important part in 
the regulation of diet, and decide not only the quan- 
tity but also the kind of food, and the form in which it 
is to be taken. For the proper assimilation of the 
nourishment and its complete effect in the organism, 
the food must be agreeable; it must relish. A supply 
of needed nourishment is not enough, man requires 
yet more. He must find his food pleasing to the 
taste. The boiling and roasting of food materials are 
operations which we find only among civilized people, 
and they have been developed with the advance of 
civilization. The whole art of coo^'ing amounts to 
this: So to prepare food that it will best sustain a 
healthy, vigorous life." Dr. J. Konig^ Berlin. 



3IO TJke Queen Cook Book 

^ The nutrition of the animal body, that is, the as- 
similation of the food taken, is dependent upon ab- 
soq;>tion. This depends upon previous chemical pro- 
cesses. These processes are contingent upon the 
secretions, the saliva, the gastric juice, etc. ; and it is 
a well known fact that the flow of these liquids is, to a 
great extent under the control of the nerves. What- 
ever excites the nerves pleasantly, causes an abundant 
secretion of the chemical agents of food change. In 
this fact lies the secret of modern cooking, and the 
judicious use of condiments or relishes." 

The Chemistry of Cooking. 

Petterhofer says of condiments: " I may compare 
them to the right use of lubricants for an engine, 
which indeed can not replace the steam power, but 
may help it to a much easier and more regular action, 
and besides, prevents, quite naturally, the wearing out 
of the machine. In order to do this, one condition is 
absolutely necessary: the lubricant must not attack 
the machine; it must be harmless.** 

If any are dyspeptic, let them replenish their vital 
energies with oxygen, by exercise in the open air. 
Nature will often restore itself, if it is not clogged by 
ourselves.

HINTS FOR THE TABLE. 

** Entice all neatly to what they know best, 
For so thou dost thyself and him a pleasure." 

Geo, Herbert, 

Every housekeeper, after making out her bill of fare, 
will endeavor, as far as is in her power, to serve it ac- 
ceptably to those who sit at her table, and in a well 
arranged, dainty and pretty way. If one has the means, 
there are innumerable articles to be had for the money 
which beautify the table. Yet, for those whose means 
are limited, there are also many ways in which the 
table may be made altogether a delight to those who 
sit about it. The first requisites aie clean white linen 
table covers and napkins, which may be adorned with 
a pretty center-piece, embroidered by some membei 
of the family, on which may rest a bowl or .vase of 
fresh garden or wild flowers, or in winter a fernery. A 
fernery may be made by gathering small ferns with 
the roots, and planting them in earth, in a metal 
basin, which can be placed in an outside basket 
of silver, celluloid, or basket-work. Something 
we already have on hand may answer the pur- 
pose, as a lady I know used the bottom of an 
old-fashioned silver castor, which made a very hand- 
some receptacle for the basin of ferns. Doylies, 
platter or tray cloths, and candlesticks with col- 
ored shades also add to the completeness and adorn- 
ment of the modern table. Tasteful, though inexpen- 
sive tableware, if china is not within reach, and all the 
eatables served in a dainty way, and in their proper 
course — not everything on the table at once — all tend 
to make a meal acceptable and enjoyable. If one 
does not have the opportunity of seeing the novelties 
brought out, or of attending a fashionable dinner or

papers, periodicals and books, that one can keep Well 
informed on the modes of the day.

Every one must make out her bill of fare according 
to circumstances and the season of the year. A few
