GREETINGS 



EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

Rome, January 20, 1922. 

Dear Mrs. Brebner: 

From over the sea I send to you and to the 
readers of your proposed book, my hearty greet- 
ings. 

Sincerely yours, 

RICHARD WASHBURN CHILD. 



FOREWORD 



The object of the "All- American Cook Book" is to assist, 
through its sale, the wounded, the unemployed and needy- 
ex-service men, especially those with dependent families. 

All profits accruing to the publishers from the sale of this 
book will be under the careful supervision of a committee of 
prominent citizens of Chicago, and receipts and expenditures 
subject to audit. This money will be given from time to time 
to the needy and dependent families of ex-service men, which 
are brought to the attention of the committee by the American 
Legion Association of Cook County, Illinois. 

It is intended particularly to relieve suffering and distress 
in a class of cases somewhat overlooked, namely, the destitute 
families of ex-service men who are in hospitals, but who have 
not yet received compensation from the Government. 

It is sincerely hoped that every American Legion Post, 
wherever located, will sell this book to carry out in its par- 
ticular locality the object mentioned, and to this end a special 
price will be named to the Post upon application to the pub- 
lishers. Profits secured by a Post from such sales are to be 
distributed to dependent families in its locality, according to 
the best judgment of the Post. 

Only through the courtesy of the wives, mothers, daugh- 
ters, sisters and friends of the men whose names appear within 
this book have I been able to compile it, for so great was 
the response that I am encouraged to compile an annual 
edition. From every country in the world I have received 
recipes from famous Americans who wished to assist me in 
this undertaking. The letters and excerpts are placed in the 
book to show the spirit of co-operation and the personal inter- 
est of the donors. The message from General Diaz is one 
intended by him to be sent to the wounded boys in the U. S. P. 
Hospitals throughout the United States, to be placed in the All- 
Am eri can Cook Book. 

The All-American Cook Book has taken one year to 
compile. There were twenty-five hundred letters written in 
order to receive these recipes. Needless to say, it was only 
a labor of love, inspired by the beautiful messages and thoughts 



of the friends who have made this book possible. 

This book has been realized financially through the kind- 
ness of Mr. W. J. Klingenberg, president of the Sheridan 
Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago. I am deeply indebted 
to him, for, through his doing so, we hope to be able to relieve 
many cases of suffering and destitution throughout the United 
States. Also to Mr. James L. Crowder and Mrs. William G. 
Zetsche I owe a great deal of thanks as interested friends and 
advisers. 

May the American people enjoy reading the All-American 
Cook Book as much as I have enjoyed compiling it. 

GERTRUDE FRELOVE BREBNER.

I only wish I had some recipe for your cook 
book, but I am just a bald-headed old bachelor 
and what I know about cooking I am sure would 
not help very much. I assure you I am with 
you in spirit in the good work you are doing. 

Very truly yours, 

HANFORD MacNIDER,

BREADS 

If you can't get cream you might as well learn to love 
your sasser of skim milk. â€” J. C. Lincoln. 

HONORABLE THOMAS R. MARSHALL 

Â£ v Former Vice-President of the United States 

"You can furnish a recipe for me, only remember â€” don't 
make it too rich for a poor Hoosier. 

"That you know I approve of you and your work, I en- 
close my check with this to buy as many books as it will, when 
issued, and give with your compliments to some poor soldiers' 
wives." Excerpt from letter, February 3, 1922. The Editor 
selected the following recipe, in accordance with the request: 

Hoosier Salt Rising Bread 

In a deep vessel make a sponge by mixing 3 cups of 
warm water or new milk, 1 teaspoon of salt and soda and 
enough flour (about 2 tablespoons) to make a batter, cover 
closely and set in a pot of warm water in a warm place. After 
6 hours (or less), add 1 qt. of flour and enough boiling water 
or scalded milk (or half and half) to make a smooth elastic 
dough, working it about % hour. Form loaves, put into but- 
tered baking pans, filling them half full, let rise until the pans 
are nearly full, and then bake in moderate oven from 30 to 40 
minutes, according to the size of the loaves. To keep, wrap 
in cloth or place in stone jars. As milk bread doesn't keep 
well in hot weather, a teaspoon of butter or lard may be sub- 
stituted for the milk. This bread may be eaten as soon as 
baked.

Roast Suckling Pig 

A pig from 3 to 6 weeks old is best for roasting. Leave 
the pig whole and wash inside and out, chop the liver and 
mix with equal quantities of bread crumbs and mashed pota- 
toes. Add 2 chopped onions, a little parsley, salt and pepper 
to taste ; mix into a paste with 2 beaten eggs, 1 lump of butter 
and 1 cup of milk. Stuff the pig with this dressing. Sew it 
up and bake about 1% to 2 hours, basting frequently. Make 
a gravy with the stuffing and the drippings. When the pig 
is done, put on a platter, put a lemon or apple in its mouth; 
serve with the sauce and lay on platter sprigs of parsley and 
any attractive garnish. This is a delicious dish if properly 
prepared.

How to Cook a Ham 

Soak the ham in cold water 24 hours then wash thoroughly. 
Put it in a boiler with skin side up and cover it with cold water. 
Put it on slow fire, so that the water will come to a boil very 
gradually. Once the water has come to a boil, it should be 
allowed to simmer slowly for about 2 hours, after which it 
should boil more quickly for 2 or 3 hours, according to size 
of the ham. In any case, whenever a fork can be stuck in 
readily to the bone, in any place, or when the hough comes 
loose, remove the boiler from the fire, and let the ham cool 
in its own water. When cool, remove, and take off skin care- 
fully. Prepare the following basting: 1 cup of sherry sub- 
stitute and Y2 cup of brown sugar. Cover the ham with stale 
bread crumbs, stick in cloves all over ham. Put in moderate 
oven and baste with the mixture until a brown crust is formed. 
Serve hot or cold. 

Note: The method above is used in Virginia and Mary- 
land, and while primarily intended for Virginia ham, it may 
successfully be used with any other variety.

Meat Balls 

To 2 lbs. of meat add % lbs. of suet. The meat and suet 
should first be cleaned thoroughly of all tough pieces and skin, 
after which it should be put through the meat grinder 6 or 7 
times. Now work in sweet milk, adding a little at a time, 
until mixture is quite soft. Form in soft balls and boil in 
slightly salted water. Serve in a brown gravy made of 2 
tablespoons of butter well browned into which has been stirred 
enough flour to thicken the quantity of gravy desired, adding 
from the stock or water in which the balls were cooked until 
the right consistency is reached. The meat should not be too 
fresh, as one often finds freshly butchered meat wet, which 
will not mix well with the suet.

will not feed roosters for years. The price is just about half 
that of hens. Disjoint as for ordinary frying chicken, except 
to cut the breast in 2 pieces. After washing and while still 
wet, salt and pepper and roll in flour. Fry in small amount 
of bacon drippings until each piece is light brown, but take 
care not to scorch. Now put in tightly covered casserole with 
small amount of water and bake slowly 3 hours, when it will 
be found very tender and of a flavor almost equalling a spring 
frier.

Chicken Brunswick Stew 

Disjoint a large chicken as for frying. In a large, shallow 
pot place a layer of salt pork diced; over the pork scatter a 
small onion chopped fine; over the onion a layer of diced 
potatoes; these should be covered with a layer of green corn 
cut from the cob. Then comes a layer of butter beans (or 
Lima), and last a layer of sliced tomatoes. Wipe the chicken 
dry, dip in flour, and arrange in pot on top of the tomatoes. 
Then begin with the diced pork again and repeat each layer. 
Pour 2 qts. of boiling water over all and cover pot closely. 
Merely simmer for 3 hours, then remove cover and season 
well with pepper, salt, a dessert spoon of sugar and a little 
Worcestershire sauce or tomato catsup. Cover the pot again 
and simmer for at least an hour longer. Just before serving 
rub 3 tablespoons butter into 2 of flour and add to the stew; 
cook gently a few minutes and serve hot. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

SALADS 

If any would not work, neither should he eat. 

â€” Old Proverb. 



A TALK ON SALADS 
By Lady Polly 

(Editor's Note: L. P. is none other than Mrs. Lewis 
Clarke Lucas of "Washington, D. C, author of the fine little 
book "All About Salads." The reprint here is with her kind 
permission.) 

There are salads galore. Meat, fowl and fish salads; egg, 
cheese and vegetable salads; nut and fruit salads. Combined 
with lettuce, cress, endive, celery; with a dressing of salt, 
pepper, oil and acids, many varied dishes may be made which 
are pleasing to the eye and delicious to the taste. 

The salad dressings mostly used are the French and the 
mayonnaise. The first is made by placing salt and pepper in 
a bowl and adding oil gradually until the salt is dissolved, 
then vinegar, stirring so that the oil may be thoroughly 
incorporated. 

The mayonnaise is made by adding oil slowly, drop by 
drop, to the yolks of eggs until you have a mixture about the 
consistency of custard and with no sign of oil or vinegar. It 
is essential that the best Italian oil be used. 

Condensed cream may be used in dressings requiring 
cream, although the fresh is to be preferred. The dressing 



60 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



must not be mixed with the salad until immediately before 
serving, and both the salad bowl and the ingredients must be 

as cold as possible. The rule with few exceptions is, that all 
meat and fish salads should be served with mayonnaise, and 
all vegetables with French dressing. 

Many salads are improved by marinating. The marinade 
should be mixed with the ingredients and set on the ice for 
awhile before serving. For instance, in making chicken salad, 
the chicken should be diced, mixed with the marinade and 
chilled. Celery, or any vegetable that should be crisp, must 
not be added until the salad is ready to be served, as the 
marinade would wither it. All fish and meat salads, without 
exception, should be marinated, and all vegetables that are not 
to be served crisp. Tomatoes are so much improved by this 
process that there is no comparison. When tomatoes are to be 
served whole they should stand in the marinade at least one 
hour. 

Lettuce or endive, with French dressing, is an everyday, 
simple salad ; those composed of meats mixed with green vege- 
tables, such as lettuce with mayonnaise, are supper and lunch- 
eon salads and should never follow a heavy dinner. "When 
served with roast, green salads are greatly improved by com- 
pounding mint or tarragon vinegar with the French dressing. 

For those who are unable to use oil there are many dress- 
ings which may be prepared without it. My advice, however, 
to such persons would be that they cultivate a taste for the oil. 

In many homes salad is always a part of the luncheon 
and dinner menu. Very little time is required in their prepa- 
ration and they are inexpensive. All classes of French serve 
salads daily and they are presumed to be most economical in 
matters pertaining to the table. 

On a hot summer day, instead of eating a heavy dinner, 
let the meal consist of a light soup, a vegetable or fish salad, 
and iced cocoa, and see how much better you feel. Go into a 
cafe on a hot day, observe the American who rushes in mopping 
his brow with his already saturated handkerchief, makes loud 
complaints of the heat, orders a heavy dinner, and bolts it 
while fanning himself vigorously. 

Our grandmothers gave much thought to the medicinal 
properties of the "greens" served at heir tables. Parsley, 
mustard, cowslip, horse radish, dock, dandelion and beet tops 
clear the blood and regulate the system. Why not make use 
of the remedies that nature supplies so lavishly, and lessen our 
druggist bills? 



THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 61 



Lettuce is a well-known nerve food, and should be seen 
on our tables more frequently. There is such a variety of 
ways in which to serve it that one is not likely to tire of it. 

Always be especially careful in preparing greens for salads 
that they are thoroughly washed, and have no gritty substance 
clinging to the leaves. I have often known very attractive- 
looking salads to be spoiled completely by carelessness in this 
particular. 

Cucumbers are very delicious and may be served raw in 
various ways. They are considered unhealthy by many, but 
unless they are old and withered they are very digestible. 
There is a prevalent superstition that cucumbers must be 
sliced and laid in salt water for hours before serving. They 
are simply ruined by this process. Keep them cool, on the 
ice if possible, and peel and slice them just before serving, 
when they will be crisp and delightful. 

String beans supply iron. One of our most valuable vege- 
tables, spinach, may be boiled and served cold with French 
dressing. It contains iron. Cabbage, cauliflower and spinach 
are all good for impoverished blood, and may be served as 
salads. Celery finds a place in many salads. It is a nerve 
food and overcomes rheumatic and neuralgic tendencies. 

The tomato is not only a delicious vegetable, but a valu- 
able one. Health authorities tell us that tomatoes stimulate 
the healthy action of the liver. 

Carrots form blood, improve the complexion, and boiled 
in salted water and cut into dice blend very well with other 
vegetables in a salad. Carrots and beets may be grated and 
sprinkled over many salads to advantage, adding a touch of 
color. 

Asparagus benefits the kidneys, and may also be served 
in various salads. 

Fruit salads are very good on hot days. They are palata- 
ble and are very easily made from any fruits in season. 

Nuts may be added to any salad. They are nourishing, 
tissue building, and by many are preferred to meat as a food. 

Pretty effects are gained by hollowing out one vegetable 
and using another as stuffing. 

"Left overs" come in very nicely for a hastily gotten up 
salad. A spoonful of cold peas, a chopped carrot, a few string 
beans and a bit of cauliflower may be mixed, a French dressing 
poured over it, and prove a very delightful, as well as econom- 
ical, addition to the menu.

My dear Mrs. Brebner: 

Your favor at hand. I was strongly tempted 
to give you as my recipe directions for eating 
radishes, of which I am very fond. I eat them 
with salt and butter and prefer the White Icicle 
variety above all others. But lest this might not 
be regarded as a full compliance to your request, 
I beg to add the recipe for another of my f avoriate 
dishes, viz: French Fried Onions. 

I first ate these at the famous Grove Park 
Inn, Asheville, N. C, and since that time have 
passed the recipe on to a number of friends as 
well as to dining car stewards. If you will take 
the large onion and cut it cross-wise, so that each 
slice will be made up of a number of rings, and 
then drop the rings separately into a thin flour 
batter and fry them as you would sliced potatoes, 
you will find them very palatable. 

I hope you may deem the humble onion 
worthy of a place in the book you are preparing. 

Very truly yours, 

W. J. BRYAN,

My dear Mrs. Brebner: 

Owing to my slow convalescence from a serious horseback 
accident, I am only able now to send you my favorite recipe. 
It is as follows: 

Pelotas a la Portugaise 

One quart can of tomatoes. Put in kettle on top of stove. 
Simmer or let boil slowly for l 1 /^ hours. Add pepper, salt, 2 
onions cut in fine slices, 4 allspice and 4 cloves. The cloves 
and allspice to be added after it starts to boil. After 1^ hours 
add : To 2 lbs. chopped beef add 1 onion chopped fine, 2 cups 
bread crumbs, a little parsley, salt and pepper. Make into 
meat balls about the size of a plum. Put into sauce and boil 
l 1 /^ hours slowly. This makes fully 3 hours slow boiling for 
the sauce. Use a package or a pound of spaghetti, not maca- 
roni. Have a large pot of boiling water with about 1 table- 
spoon of salt. Slide the spaghetti into the water. Do not 
break it. Boil exactly 20 minutes. Must be tender, not tough, 
nor doughy. To sauce add 3 bay leaves 1 hour before taking 
off the stove. Serve spaghetti on large platter, pouring tomato 
sauce over it. Serve pelotas on smaller platter, allowing a 
small quantity of sauce to remain on them. Serve grated Par- 
mesan cheese on side. Use the piece of cheese to grate, not 
bottled cheese. This serves from 6 to 8 persons. 

Wishing you every success in your enterprise, 
Very sincerely yours, 

John Philip Sousa.

Dear Mrs. Brebner: 

Both my wife and I are only too glad to aid

of us, however, is very much of a cook, and I am 
afraid our recipes would not go very much further

eat it. So I expect you will have to assign some 
delectable recipe to us and let us get by somewhat 
in the fashion of a camouflaged ship.

Baked Beans 
I received your letter of March 28th this 
morning and am somewhat surprised that out of 
all the recipes that you have received none speak- 
ing of baked beans. How strange! "Well, there 
are lots of things I do not know, but I do at least 
know "beans." I was born in*Beverley, Mass., 
and people from there are called "Bevereley 
Beaners," because it is supposed that that was 
where baked beans were discovered. Much is 
heard of "Boston beans," but that is due to the 
fact that beans were first canned in Boston. They 
had to go to Beverley to learn how to bake them, 
however, before doing so. My old grandmother, 
who taught me how to bake beans, used to execute 
the process in the following way : Select a quart 
of white pea beans. Sort them well over and 
clear them of all foreign substance. Then, suppos- 
ing it is Friday night, place them in a basin of 
hot water, the water barely covering. Leave them 
there until the next morning. Then take an 
earthenware pot, preferably one of those enameled 
inside, but the then parboiled beans in the above 
pot, place a half pound piece of salt pork over. 
Through the top of the pork cut diagonal lines, 
just cutting through the rind. Next pour in water 
until it barely covers the pork, then place in a 
slow oven at say 8 o'clock in the morning and 
allow to remain there until about 5 in the after- 
noon. Stand guard over the door of the oven and 
shoot anybody who attempts to open the oven 
door for the purpose of pouring in water or other 
objects. When the beans are removed they will 
be found to be just what our old grandmothers 
used to bake and take pride in, and they knew 
better before or since what beans were, including 
your humble servant. 

Cordially yours, 

JOHN H. GROUT,

I don't know much about cooking, but I hap- 
pen to have with me a recipe for Lemon Meringue 
Pie such as I have eaten in my Maryland home 
ever since I can remember. It's 100 per cent . 
American, alright, and mighty good. 

If this will be of use for your "100% Amer- 
ican Recipes" you are quite welcome to it (as well 
as to the Pumpkin Pie one which happens to be 
on the same sheet, and that I therefore enclose), 
especially if it can help a deserving ex-service man

PAUL H. GRAM

NOTE : This is the only cake ever been known to be made 
without baking. 

Uncooked Fruit Cake 

One and ^ lbs. of seeded raisins, y 2 lb. of dried currants, 
% lb. of dates, y 2 lb. of figs, y 2 lb. of candied cherries, V2 lb. 
of crystallized pineapple, % lb. of citron, % lb. of shelled 
pecans, 2 cups of oatmeal, iy 2 cups of wheat biscuit, 1 
cup of grape juice, 1 cup of thick blackberry juice, % cup 
of strained honey, 4 tablespoons of olive oil, spices to flavor 
well. 

Combine the fruit juices and drop into them a few pieces 
of cinnamon bark, a few whole cloves, allspice, and about an 
eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg. Place the mixture over 
a slow fire and allow it to simmer until it is well flavored with 
the spices. Do not let it boil rapidly at all, and, when flavored, 
remove it from the fire and strain through cheesecloth. 

Run the oatmeal and wheat biscuit through a meat chop- 
per before measuring. Reheat the fruit juice to the boiling 
point, and pour it over the cereals; then cover it closely and 
set it away overnight. 

Prepare the fruit and the nuts as for the usual fruit cake. 
The currants will need washing through half a dozen waters 
and must dry overnight. If one prefers they may be left out 
and the same amount of some other fruit used instead ; but the 
flavor of the currant will repay one for the extra trouble of 
cleansing. The nuts are best broken into small pieces; the 
raisins, dates, figs, pineapple and citron cut into bits, and the 
cherries left whole. When ready to mix measure the honey 
and olive oil, and stir them into the cereals and fruit juice. 
Combine the nuts and fruits and work them into this, using the 
hands. The mixing must be done in a large pan so as to blend 
everything thoroughly. 

Line a pan with white paper brushed over with olive oil. 
Pack the mixture in this, a little at a time, pressing it down 
until it is perfectly solid. Decorate the top with nuts and 
cherries, and cover it with a paper brushed in oil. 

Put the cake in a covered bread tin and set it in a cool 
place for several weeks or longer. Several days before cutting 
it wrap it in a cloth wet with grape juice.

UNITED STATES SENATE 
Committee on the Library 

March 20, 1922. 

My dear Madam : 

I received your letter of March 10th. I would 
be very glad to help you, but I don't know how to 
cook anything in the world except hard-boiled 
eggs, and I imagine everybody knows that. I can 
also make a cup of coffee, but when I do, I make it 
so strong that the dregs have to be drained out 
of it with cheesecloth. One good cup of it, though, 
threatens a man with delirium tremens. I don't 
think any of my recipes would help your book. 
My recipe for cooking hard-boiled eggs is to "put 
them in boiling water and then forget it." If you 
forget them long enough, they are hard-boiled. 

Very truly yours, 
JOHN SHARP WILLIAMS

remove seeds and chop lemons; add sugar and ginger root, 
and cook very slowly 6 hours. Pour into glasses and seal. 

GOVERNOR M. C. MECHEM, State of New Mexico 
Preserved Quince 

This is different from the kind that our mothers used 
to make, but is very palatable. The quince flourishes in New 
Mexico to an unusual degree, and the quality of the fruit is 
the finest of any on the market. In preparing this preserve 
always ask for New Mexico quinces. 

Take 12 large, ripe quinces and peel and quarter them, 
leaving the seeds and core, and boil in clear water slowly until 
tender. While hot, press them through a colander, or remove 
the seeds and cores and run the fruit through a meat grinder. 

To 1 cup of quince take 1 cup of sugar and mix in a 
graniteware kettle, and cook slowly about y 2 an hour, or until 
you are able to see the bottom of the kettle through the liquid, 
and if none of the mixture sticks to the pan it has cooked 
enough. Take it from the stove and beat it as you would beat 



148 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



an egg, continually, until it becomes cold, when it should be 
put in small molds, just large enough for serving 1 person. As 
soon as it has hardened it is ready to use. 

It is difficult to give exact directions for making this 
preserve, but if one acquires the art of it they will find it well 
worth the effort. 

U. S. SENATOR MILES POINDEXTER, State of Washington 

Chairman, Committee on Mines and Mining 

Orange Marmalade 

One grapefruit, 1 orange and 1 lemon. Slice the fruit 
peel and all; to 1 cup of fruit add 3 cups of cold water, letting

of sugar. Let juice come to a boil and add sugar, letting it 
boil until it jellies.

in preserving kettle and allow to melt slowly on the back 
of the stove, being careful it does not burn ; it will take several 
hours for the sugar to melt. When very hot add the rasp- 
berries and boil very fast 3 minutes, when it will be clear 
and ready to put in glasses. Currants or strawberries may be 
treated in the same way. 

Note : This method of making jam gives all the flavor of 
fresh fruit and beautiful color. 

U. S. SENATOR D. W. FLETCHER, State of Florida 

Orange Marmalade

strip in fine pieces and % of peel grind coarsely in meat chop- 
per. Slice the fruit, remove seeds, core ; mix with the peel and 
cover with 3 times its weight in water. Boil 1 hour. Add equal 
weight in sugar and boil 1 hour, or until the syrup is the color 
of amber and as thick as honey. Put into glasses ; cover with 
melted paraffine when cold.

"My dear Mrs. Brebner: 

"Please pardon by long delay in answering 
your letter of March 15, 1922. I have been wait- 
ing for my property to arrive from Camp Dix, 
N. J., in which I have many valuable recipes gath- 
ered during my long service in the army, but, at 
the present time, this property is still somewhere 
en route. Hence, I will consider it a favor if you 
will put my name to one or more recipes that you 
may furnish to put in your book. 

"I heartily indorse your work, and I believe a 
book of this kind will bring in a good revenue to 
the dependent families and wounded of our late 
war. No doubt it will be both valuable to the 
people who buy such a book for the many valuable 
recipes contained therein, but, in addition, it will 
be a souvenir of this generation to the generations 
to come in that it contains the names of the dis- 
tinguished men of this time. I assure you that 
you have my hearty support, and you are at 
liberty to associate my name with one or more 
recipes that you may select.

lent for sufferers from insomnia.

170 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



USES OF LEMONS 

The lemon is not sufficiently appreciated from a hygienic 
standpoint; for instance: 

Lemon juice removes stains from the hands. 

A dash of lemon juice in plain water is an excellent tooth 
wash ; it not only removes the tartar, but sweetens the breath. 

Lemon juice applications will allay irritation caused by the 
bites of insects. 

The juice of a lemon taken in hot water on awakening is 
an excellent liver corrective, and for stout people is better than 
any "anti-fat" medicine ever invented. 

Glycerine and lemon juice, half and half, on a bit of 
absorbent cotton is the best thing in the world wherewith to 
moisten the lips of a fever-parched patient. 

Lemon juice and salt will remove rust stains. 

For a manicure aid lemon juice is all that is necessary for 
loosening the cuticle and for brightening and cleansing the 
nails. 

Save your lemon rinds and dry them for kindling ; a hand- 
ful will revive a dying fire. 



HELPFUL HINTS 



COMMON WAYS OF COOKING FOOD 

Baking is cooking in confined heat in the oven. Examples: 
Bread, cake, meat. This method when applied to meat is 
eommonly called roasting. Before baking, see that the 
oven is clean and heated to the desired temperature. 

Boiling is cooking by immersion in water at 212Â°. F. Exam- 
ples: Potatoes, cabbage, macaroni. 

Braising is a combination of stewing on the top of the range, 
and baking in the oven, with or without vegetables. Exam- 
ples: Tough meats, fowl, whole liver. 

Broiling or Grilling is cooking over or under direct heat, as 
over glowing coals or under a gas flame. Examples: 
Steaks, chops. 

Fricasseeing is commonly a combination of stewing and saut6- 
ing. Examples: Fowl, forequarter of lamb or veal. 

Frying is cooking by immersion in hot, deep fat. Examples: 
Doughnuts, croquettes. 

Pan-baking or Pan-broiling is cooking in a lightly greased or 
ungreased hot frying pan or griddle. Examples: Steak, 
English muffins, griddle cakes. 

Pot Roasting is cooking in an iron kettle or earthen pot in a 
small amount of water, after meat has been quickly 
browned in a small amount of fat in the frying pan or 
kettle. Cook slowly until very tender with or without 
vegetables. 



172 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



Roasting is cooking before an open fire. This method is seldom 
used in small households, although the baking of meats is 
commonly called roasting. 

Sauteing is cooking in a small amount of fat in a shallow pan 
on top of range. Examples: Sliced fish, meat, potatoes, 
eggs. 

Simmering is cooking in liquid at 185Â° F. The bubbles should 
always be below the surface. Examples: Ham, corned 
beef, soups. 

Steaming. Dry Steaming is cooking by heat or steam, as in 
double boiler or tin, over or surrounded by boiling water. 
Examples: Rice, brown bread. 

Moist Steaming is cooking by direct contact with steam, as in 
a steamer or colander, over boiling water, closely covered. 
Examples: Fowl, puddings, dumplings. 

Stewing is cooking slowly in a small amount of water (about 
160Â° F.) until food is very tender. Examples: Beef, 
lamb, vegetables.

WHEN COOKING OYSTERS 

Never salt soups or stews until just before removing 
from the fire. 

In frying oysters a little baking powder added to the 
cracker crumbs will greatly improve them. 

Escalloped oysters retain their flavor better if covered 
while cooking. 

Half the liquor, heated, or hot milk, may be poured over 
escalloped oysters when half baked. 

It is always better to handle oysters with a fork, as con- 
tact with the hands may make them tough. 



DIGESTIBLE CABBAGE 

Cabbage is made digestible by first slicing and then putting 
in boiling water with a pinch of soda and some salt, and boil- 
ing just 15 minutes. 



PRUNE DESSERT 

Soak prunes over night. Boil slowly until very tender. 
Sweeten to taste. When they have cooled in their own liquor, 
pierce one side with a pointed knife, remove the stone and 
fill with chopped nuts and raisins, mixed. Serve with whipped 
cream. 



TENDER PINEAPPLES 

The toughness of pineapples is almost entirely eliminated 
by slicing the fruit up and down, from stem to blossom end, 
instead of through the core as is usually done. Thrust a fork 
into the blossom end to hold the apple steady and slice until 
you come to the hard, pithy core, which can then be discarded. 
This trick was taught me by an old pineapple grower and 
makes all the difference in the world in the tenderness of this 
fruit, which is usually hard and chippy when sliced with 
instead of against the grain. 



THE AU- AMERICAN COOK BOOK 175 



POULTRY 

For market, dry picking is the best way â€” that is, pulling 
out the feathers immediately after killing, while the poultry 
is still warm, but for home consumption, the scalding method 
is quicker and easier. After killing dip in scalding hot water 
and move about for a few minutes, then pick as quickly as 
possible. Ducks should be scalded a little longer and then 
wrapped in canvas or any close cloth, to steam about 5 to 10 
minutes, after which the feathers can be easily pulled. The 
hairs should be singed off by holding and turning the poultry 
in the flames of a lighted twist of paper, or some burning 
alcohol. Wash thoroughly and dry, and then lay on several 
folds of paper, and clean at once. The quicker poultry is 
cleaned, the better, but it is best not to cook it until 24 hours 
after killing. 

After singeing, and before drawing, pull out all pin 
feathers, then clut off the head, and next cut through the skin 
around each leg, about 1% inches below the first leg, being 
careful not to cut tendons. Place the leg with the cut over the 
edge of a table, press downward to snap the bone, then take 
the foot in the right hand, holding the bird firmly in the left 
hand, and pull off the foot, and with it the tendons. Make a 
lengthwise cut through the skin just below the breast bone, 
large enough to admit the hand, and remove the entrails entire, 
by first carefully loosening them all around, and then bringing 
the hand forward, grasping the entrails firmly, and with one 
pull drawing them out. The lungs and kidneys, on either side 
of the backbone, should next be removed, and then the wind- 
pipe and crop, close to the skin of the breast, by inserting two 
fingers under the neck skin. Draw down the skin and cut the 
neck off close to the body, leaving on enough skin to close up 
the opening after the crop is partly filled with a little dressing. 
The giblets (gizzard, heart and liver) should next be carefully 
separated from the entrails, being careful not to break the gall 
bag attached to the liver, the bile from which would impart 
an extremely bitter flavor to any parts it came in contact with. 
Then wash the bird thoroughly in and outside, rub with salt, 
and let hang in a cool place over night. 



176 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



CANNING PIE PLANT 

Pick when it is long and good, cut up and put in glass 
fruit cans, press down, cover with cold water, seal and put 
away. It will keep fresh until the new crop comes. In sections 
where the fruit is scarce, it can be easily raised, and is easily 
kept as described. 



PICNIC SANDWICHES 

Bake the bread in quart cans and press the chopped meat 
or chicken in cans of the same size. When both are cold put 
very thin slices of meat between two buttered slices of the 
bread. If your bread and meat are good, you will be proud 
of your sandwiches. 



WHEN BAKING 

If a handful of salt is put on bottom of oven under pans 
when baking ginger-bread or any cake easily burned, it will 
prevent burning. 

Putting a pinch of salt in the coffee improves the flavor. 



TO BOIL VEGETABLES 

When cooking lima beans, rice, etc., it is very provoking 
to have them foam and sputter from the kettle onto one's 
clean stove. Drop into the kettle a small lump of butter and 
there will be no "boiling over." 



OLIVE OIL IN BAKED BEANS 

Use 5 full tablespoons of olive oil to 1 qt. of dry beans. 
They are delicious and more easily digested than when pork 
is used. 



THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 177 

OATMEAL PIE CRUST 

Scald 2 parts of fine oatmeal with 1 part of of hot water; 
mix well and roll thin. As this bakes very quickly, fruit which 
requires much cooking must be cooked first before making the 
pies. This crust is very tender, possessing all the desirable 
qualities of shortened pie crusts without their injurious effects. 



SAVE DRY BREAD 

If your bread becomes dry, do not throw it away; it is 
a part of Darby's hard earnings. Dip the dry loaf quickly 
into water, put in pan, place in oven and leave until crust is 
dry. The steam from the external moisture will enter the loaf, 
leaving it fresh as when newly-baked. 



TO KEEP TINS PROM RUSTDNG 

Tin vessels used in water often rust. This can be pre- 
vented by greasing well and heating in oven. They will not 
rust then, no matter how much used in water. Care should 
be taken not to burn the vessel. 



SEASONING A FOWL 

To improve the flavor of fowl, when seasoning it, add 
ginger to the salt and pepper, and rub this into flesh well. 
For a change, try putting an onion and an apple in ducks in 
place of the usual bread-crumb dressing. 



KEEPDNG POTATOES DN WINTER 

To keep sweet potatoes through the winter perfectly, line 
a barrel with warm dry newspapers, side and bottom, then 
wrap each potato in paper and pack into it, till full, cover well 
and keep in warm, dry kitchen or any warm, dry room. A 
smaller quantity may be packed in a box in the same way, and 



178 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



kept in warm, dry atmosphere. To keep Irish potatoes in the 
cellar, sprinkle air-slacked lime among them ; it seems to keep 
them dry and healthy. (As they are sorted, sprinkle a little 
in every layer.) 



VINEGAR IN DOUGHNUTS 

For doughnuts made with sour milk or cream, add a gen- 
erous half-teaspoonful of vinegar to the batter before adding 
the full amount of flour. 



BOILED LEMONADE 

In making lemonade, boil the desired quantity of sugar 
and lemon juice together, cool and add as much cold water as 
needed â€” a great improvement on the old way. 



SUBSTITUTES FOR ALCOHOL IN MINCE PEE 

Â«, 

Instead of cider and other alcoholic liquors, use fruit juices 
for mince pies. The juice left from canning strawberries, sour 
Cherries, plums, etc., if sweetened, boiled down and canned, 
makes a rich, delicious moistening for mince meat. If raisins 
and suet in plenty are added to the mixture, it will be rich 
enough to please the most fastidious appetite. 



A COOKING HINT 

Turn the colander upside down over the fish or meat 
sauteing in an iron spider; the small holes allow the steam 
to escape and still prevent the grease from spattering. 



BAKING DAY 

After taking bread from the oven, do not wrap tightly in 
cloth as many do ; but rub the top of loaves with a little lard 



THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 179 



or butter, tip on edge on your kneading board so that all 
possible crust is exposed to the air and if possible place out- 
doors or in the wind to cool quickly a few minutes, then 
remove to convenient place and let stand until thoroughly 
cold before putting away in box or can, and you will have 
delicious, tender crust. 



PREVENTS SOGGY PIE-CRUST 

Pie-crust will not be soggy if brushed over with the white 
of an egg before the fruit is put in. 



CARE OF WOODEN BOWLS 

To prevent wooden bowls from splitting, take them when 
new, before they have been touched with water, applying boil- 
ing hot linseed oil over the outside and top edge, all that will 
penetrate. 



FRIED SQUASH 

Cut a fine-grained, dry, sweet squash into thin slices, pare 
and fry in plenty of butter and season well. This dish will 
be found an excellent substitute for sweet potatoes. 



TO SAVE PLANTS 

To prevent bugs from eating your cucumber vines, plant 
one stalk of garlic in each cucumber hill; nothing will then 
bother the plant. 



TESTING FLOUR 

There are several methods of testing flour, which should 
be known to every purchaser. If flour is white with a yellow- 
ish straw tinge, it is good, while if it has a bluish cast, or has 



180 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



black specks in it, it is inferior. 

Wet and knead a little of it between the fingers; if it 
works soft and sticky, it is poor ; if elastic and firm, it is good. 
If a little flour is thrown against a dry, smooth surface and it 
falls like powder, it is not of the best quality. If flour squeezed 
in the hand retains the shape given it when released, it is of 
good quality. 



USES OF BUTTERMILK 

Should you be so unfortunate as to be poisoned by poison 
ivy, bathe the affected parts in buttermilk every 10 or 15 
minutes until the poison is counteracted. Should the case be 
a severe one, poultice the blisters with bread and buttermilk 
poultice. It will give relief very soon and will cure the most 
severe cases. 

Buttermilk will remove mildew from cloth, white or col- 
ored. Soak the garment over night, then lay it on the grass 
in the sunlight. If the stain is set, soak the cloth for two 
or three days and lay it in the sun. 

Buttermilk is excellent for freshening salt pork for frying. 
Slice the pork and soak over night, or set on stove and let it 
come to a boil, dip in flour and fry.

"Dear Madame: 

"Referring to your letter of August 1st, which reached me 
but a day or so ago, I am sorry to say that I am not able to 
comply with your request to furnish you my favoriate recipe, 
because I pay so little attention to the question of food that 
I eat what comes to me and ask no questions. 

"If there is any one dish that I would specially desire 
above all others, it would be an Irish stew."

Dear Mrs. Brebner: 

In reply to your letter of January 27th, I beg 
to say that while Mrs. Grew and I have no recipe 
available for your cook book, we shall be glad to 
be numbered among the "100% Americans" and 
to be credited with some recipe which you may 
furnish. 

Respectfully yours,

AMERICAN CONSULATE 
Dairen, Manchuria 

March 3, 1922. 

My dear Mrs. Brebner: 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your let- 
ter of January 12, and hasten to send a recipe 
of Mrs. Kirjassoff' s, which is one of my favorites. 

Chicken Pilau 

This is an Indian dish, often mentioned in 
Thackeray's novels (Thackeray was born in Cal- 
cutta), which is very popular with all Americans 
and Europeans who visit India. 

I trust that the book you contemplate will 
have great success. My wife and I thank you for 
this opportunity to have even a small share 
therein. 

Very sincerely yours, 

Max D. Kirjassoff. 

Chicken Pilau 

One medium sized chicken, yÂ± cup concentrated pan gravy, 
1^ cups rice, 5 cloves, 1 stick cinnamon, butter size of an egg, 
y 2 cup seedless raisins (boiled for 5 minutes and with water 
drained off), ^ cup almonds (blanched and browned), 1 onion 
cut in strips and fried in butter until crisp and brown, 2 hard- 
boiled eggs. Bake the chicken until tender, preserving the 
gravy. Boil rice in salted water together with the cloves and 
the stick of cinnamon. When half cooked, remove spices, drain 
off water, and complete cooking by steaming. "When finished 
the rice must be dry with each kernel separate. Mix butter 
with the rice, together with the pan gravy and raisins. Make 
a mound of the rice in the center of a platter. Sprinkle with 
almonds and the fried onion and garnish with the hard-boiled 
eggs cut in halves. Cut the chicken for serving and arrange 
the pieces around the mound of rice. 

This is a most delicious dish, and the rice prepared in 
this way has a very rich, exotic flavor. 



MAJOR GENERAL J. A. LEJEUNE 

Commandant U. S. Marine Corps 

"Pain Perdue" (Lost Bread) 

"This is a favorite dish in Louisiana where Gen. Lejeune 
was born and reared." â€” Mrs. J. A. Lejeune. 

One loaf of bread (a day or two old), and in slices *4 inch 
thick, 3 eggs, 3 tablespoons of sugar stirred together, and 
1 or 2 tablespoons of lard. Have the lard very hot ; dip slices 
of bread in the egg mixture and fry brown on each side. 



WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT 

Chief Justice, Supreme Court, former President of the 
United States 

Rolled Chops 

Cut egg plant into rounds, roll them in egg and bread 
crumbs, and fry. Take loin chops, cut thick, and roll them 
into rounds, putting a tooth pick into them. Broil them and 
put them on the egg plant and pour truffle sauce over them. 
(See sauces.) 



1923 IS COMING 

This years' book of 1922 is closed and sealed at last 
Nor would I alter what is past. 
My work, my pleasures, thoughts and acts, 
Are all on record as plain facts. 
But here before me pure and white, 
Are pages for recipes of 1923 to write. 
More recipes from these same donors will I borrow, 
And start the "All- American Cook Book" of tomorrow.

GEEETINGS 



EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

Rome, January 20, 1922. 

Dear Mrs. Brebner: 

From over the sea I send to you and to the 
readers of your proposed book, my hearty greet- 
ings. 

Sincerely yours, 

RICHARD WASHBURN CHILD. 



FOREWORD 



The object of the " All- American Cook Book" is to assist, 
through its sale, the wounded, the unemployed and needy- 
ex-service men, especially those with dependent families. 

All profits accruing to the publishers from the sale of this 
book will be under the careful supervision of a committee of 
prominent citizens of Chicago, and receipts and expenditures 
subject to audit. This money will be given from time to time 
to the needy and dependent families of ex-service men, which 
are brought to the attention of the committee by the American 
Legion Association of Cook County, Illinois. 

It is intended particularly to relieve suffering and distress 
in a class of cases somewhat overlooked, namely, the destitute 
families of ex-service men who are in hospitals, but who have 
not yet received compensation from the Government. 

It is sincerely hoped that every American Legion Post, 
wherever located, will sell this book to carry out in its par- 
ticular locality the object mentioned, and to Ibis end a special 
price will be named to the Post upon application to the pub- 
lishers. Profits secured by a Post from such sales are to be 
distributed to dependent families in its locality, according to 
the best judgment of the Post. 

Only through the courtesy of the wives, mothers, daugh- 
ters, sisters and friends of the men whose names appear within 
this book have I been able to compile it, for so great was 
the response that I am encouraged to compile an annual 
edition. From every country in the world I have received 
recipes from famous Americans who wished to assist me in 
this undertaking. The letters and excerpts are placed in the 
book to show the spirit of co-operation and the personal inter- 
est of the donors. The message from General Diaz is one 
intended by him to be sent to the wounded boys in the U. S. P. 
Hospitals throughout the United States, to be placed in the AU- 
Ameriean Cook Book. 

The Ail-American Cook Book has taken one year to 
compile. There were twenty-five hundred letters written in 
order to receive these recipes. Needless to say, it was only 
a labor of love, inspired by the beautiful messages and thoughts 



of the friends who have made this book possible. 

This book has been realized financially through the kind- 
ness of Mr. W. J. Kling-enberg-, president of the Sheridan 
Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago. I am deeply indebted 
to him, for, through his doing so, we hope to be able to relieve 
many cases of suffering and destitution throughout the United 
States. Also to Mr. James L. Crowder and Mrs. William G. 
Zetsche I owe a great deal of thanks as interested friends and 
advisers. 

May the American people enjoy reading the All-American 
Cook Book as much as I have enjoyed compiling it. 

GERTRUDE FRELOVE BREBNER. 

Chicago, June 7, 1922.

Thank you very much for your letter of No- 
vember 21st. 

I certainly agree with you about our unem- 
ployed ex-service men and we want to do every- 
thing we can to see that they get properly taken 
care of. 

I only wish I had some recipe for your cook 
book, but I am just a bald-headed old bachelor 
and what I know about cooking I am sure would 
not help very much. I assure you I am with 
you in spirit in the good work you are doing. 

Very truly yours, 

HANFORD MacNIDER,

trust that Mr. MacNider and other "bald-headed old bach- 
elors" like the dish.)

wished, white flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, i^ cup of molasses, l^

BREADS 

If you can't get cream you might as well learn to love 
your sasser of skim milk. â€” J. C. Lincoln. 

HONORABLE THOMAS R. MARSHALL 

â–  Former Vice-President of the United States 

"You can furnish a recipe for me, only remember â€” don't 
make it too rich for a poor Hoosier. 

''That you know I approve of you and your work, I en- 
close my check with this to buy as many books as it will, when 
issued, and give with your compliments to some poor soldiers' 
wives." Excerpt from letter, February 3, 1922. The Editor 
selected the following recipe, in accordance with the request : 

Hoosier Salt Rising Bread 

In a deep vessel make a sponge by mixing 3 cups of 
warm water or new milk, 1 teaspoon of salt and soda and 
enough flour (about 2 tablespoons) to make a batter, cover 
closely and set in a pot of warm water in a warm place. After 
6 hours (or less), add 1 qt. of flour and enough boiling water 
or scalded milk (or half and half) to make a smooth elastic 
dough, working it about i/^ hour. Form loaves, put into but- 
tered ijaking pans, filling them half full, let rise until the pans 
are nearly full, and then bake in moderate oven from 30 to 40 
minutes, according to the size of the loaves. To keep, wrap 
in cloth or place in stone jars. As milk bread doesn't keep 
well in hot weather, a teaspoon of butter or lard may be sub- 
stituted for the milk. This bread may be eaten as soon as 
baked.

warm add to yeast and 2 cups of flour. Beat 5 minutes. Let 
rise until very light (takes about 1 hour), add 3 tablespoons 
of melted shortening and li/^ teaspoons of salt. Stir in 5 cups 
of flour; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, using more 
flour if necessary. Cover to let rise and when light (double 
its bulk) mold into French Loaves. Divide the dough in half 
and each half into twelve, making 24 loaves. Roll each 5 
inches long, taper each end. Lay on greased pan sufficient 
distance apart not to touch each other, cover to let rise an 
hour in warm place. Bake real brown.

in 1830. Written as it was made in 1830 when the brick oven 
was used. 

"Mrs. Governor Meig's Bread" 

Sift about 4 qts. of flour in a bread bowl, add 2 teaspoons 
of salt, 14 pt. of "Daphne's" yeast (which today would be 
the same as any home-made yeast), 1 qt. of lukewarm milk;

raise until morning, then add to it I/2 pt- of warm milk, stir- 
ring in gradually the warmed flour, until the batter is nearly 
thick enough to knead ; then put in a warm place for about 
1^2 hours, then knead it a long while; then put it again in

How to Cook a Ham 

Soak the ham in cold water 24 hours then wash thoroughly. 
Put it in a boiler with skin side up and cover it with cold water. 
Put it on slow fire, so that the water wdll come to a boil very 
gradually. Once the water has come to a boil, it should be 
allowed to simmer slowly for about 2 hours, after which it 
should boil more quickly for 2 or 3 hours, according to size 
of the ham. In any case, whenever a fork can be stuck in 
readily to the bone, in any place, or when the hough comes 
loose, remove the boiler from the fire, and let the ham cool 
in its own water. When cool, remove, and take off skin care- 
fully. Prepare the following basting: 1 cup of sherry sub- 
stitute and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Cover the ham with stale 
bread crumbs, stick in cloves all over ham. Put in moderate 
oven and baste with the mixture until a brown crust is formed. 
Serve hot or cold. 

Note : The method above is used in Virginia and Mary- 
land, and while primarily intended for Virginia ham, it may 
successfully be used with any other variety.

Chicken and Rice 

Pick clean and singe 2 fowls, cut in moderate sized pieces. 
Put 1 tablespoon lard into stewpan and brown small piece 
of onion (chopped). When browned add % lb. tomatoes, 
having previously peeled them, taken out the pips and cut 
them into small pieces. When these begin to fry add the cut 
up chicken, adding pepper, salt and allspice to taste. Stir 
all briskly and leave all to simmer for y^ of an hour, stirring 
occasionally. Then add sufficient hot water to cover all, and 
allow it to simmer over a slow fire (stirring from time to time) 
for about IV2 hours. When the chicken begins to get tender 
add y2 lb. of rice and let all remain on the fire about 20 min- 
utes. Add a sprig of parsley, which should be taken out when 
the stew is served. If it seems too dry a little water may be 
added while it is simmering. Great care must be taken that 
the stew shall not stick to the bottom of the pot, and also 
that the chickens may be perfectly tender without falling to 
pieces.

Economy Fried Chicken 

Take a fowl known to the poultry people as "old rooster," 
but is seldom as old as he looks, for the reason that people 
will not feed roosters for years. The price is just about half 
that of hens. Disjoint as for ordinary frying chicken, except 
to cut the breast in 2 pieces. After washing and while still 
wet, salt and pepper and roll in flour. Fry in small amount 
of bacon drippings until each piece is light brown, but take 
care not to scorch. Now put in tightly covered casserole with 
small amount of water and bake slowly 3 hours, when it v/ill 
be found very tender and of a flavor almost equalling a spring 
frier. 



DAVID J. D. MYERS 

American Consul to Montevideo, Uruguay 

Chicken Brunswick Stew 

Disjoint a large chicken as for frying. In a large, shallow 
pot place a layer of salt pork diced ; over the pork scatter a 
small onion chopped fine ; over the onion a layer of diced 
potatoes ; these should be covered with a layer of green corn 
cut from the cob. Then comes a layer of butter beans (or 
Lima), and last a layer of sliced tomatoes. Wipe the chicken 
dry, dip in flour, and arrange in pot on top of the tomatoes. 
Then begin with the diced pork again and repeat each layer. 
Pour 2 qts. of boiling water over all and cover pot closely. 
Merely simmer for 3 hours, then remove cover and season 
well with pepper, salt, a dessert spoon of sugar and a little 
Worcestershire sauce or tomato catsup. Cover the pot again 
and simmer for at least an hour longer. Just before serving 
rub 3 tablespoons butter into 2 of flour and add to the stew; 
cook gently a few minutes and serve hot. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

SALADS 



If any would not work, neither should he eat. 

â€” Old Proverb, 



A TALK ON SALADS 
By Lady Polly 

(Editor's Note: L. P. is none other than Mrs. Lewis 
Clarke Lucas of "Washington, D. C, author of the fine little 
book "All About Salads." The reprint here is with her kind 
permission.) 

There are salads galore. Meat, fowl and fish salads; egg, 
cheese and vegetable salads ; nut and fruit salads. Combined 
with lettuce, cress, endive, celery; with a dressing of salt, 
pepper, oil and acids, many varied dishes may be made which 
are pleasing to the eye and delicious to the taste. 

The salad dressings mostly used are the French and the 
mayonnaise. The first is made by placing salt and pepper in 
a bowl and adding oil gradually until the salt is dissolved, 
then vinegar, stirring so that the oil may be thoroughly 
incorporated. 

The mayonnaise is made by adding oil slowly, drop by 
drop, to the yolks of eggs until you have a mixture about the 
consistency of custard and with no sign of oil or vinegar. It 
is essential that the best Italian oil be used. 

Condensed cream may be used in dressings requiring 
cream, although the fresh is to be preferred. The dressing 



60 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



must not be mixed with the salad until immediately before 
serving, and both the salad bowl and the ingredients must be 

as cold as possible. The rule with few exceptions is, that all 
meat and fish salads should be served with mayonnaise, and 
all vegetables with French dressing. 

Many salads are improved by marinating. The marinade 
should be mixed with the ingredients and set on the ice for 
awhile before serving. For instance, in making chicken salad, 
the chicken should be diced, mixed with the marinade and 
chilled. Celery, or any vegetable that should be crisp, must 
not be added until the salad is ready to be served, as the 
marinade would wither it. All fish and meat salads, without 
exception, should be marinated, and all vegetables that are not 
to be served crisp. Tomatoes are so much improved by this 
process that there is no comparison. When tomatoes are to be 
served whole they should stand in the marinade at least one 
hour. 

Lettuce or endive, Avith French dressing, is an everyday, 
simple salad ; those composed of meats mixed with green vege- 
tables, such as lettuce with mayonnaise, are supper and lunch- 
eon salads and should never follow a heavy dinner. "When 
served with roast, green salads are greatly improved by com- 
pounding mint or tarragon vinegar with the French dressing. 

For those who are unable to use oil there are many dress- 
ings which may be prepared without it. My advice, however, 
to such persons would be that they cultivate a taste for the oil. 

In many homes salad is always a part of the luncheon 
and dinner menu. Very little time is required in their prepa- 
ration and they are inexpensive. All classes of French serve 
salads daily and they are presumed to be most economical in 
matters pertaining to the table. 

On a hot summer day, instead of eating a heavy dinner, 
let the meal consist of a light soup, a vegetable or fish salad, 
and iced cocoa, and see how much better you feel. Go into a 
cafe on a hot day, observe the American who rushes in mopping 
his brow with his already saturated handkerchief, makes loud 
complaints of the heat, orders a heavy dinner, and bolts it 
while fanning himself vigorously. 

Our grandmothers gave much thought to the medicinal 
properties of the "greens" served at heir tables. Parsley, 
mustard, cowslip, horse radish, dock, dandelion and beet tops 
clear the blood and regulate the system. "Why not make use 
of the remedies that nature supplies so lavishly, and lessen our 
druggist bills? 



THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 61 



Lettuce is a well-known nerve food, and should be seen 
on our tables more frequently. There is such a variety of 
ways in which to serve it that one is not likely to tire of it. 

Always be especially careful in preparing greens for salads 
that they are thoroughly washed, and have no gritty substance 
clinging to the leaves. I have often known very attractive- 
looking salads to be spoiled completely by carelessness in this 
particular. 

Cucumbers are very delicious and may be served raw in 
various ways. They are considered unhealthy by many, but 
unless they are old and withered they are very digestible. 
There is a prevalent superstition that cucumbers must be 
sliced and laid in salt water for hours before serving. They 
are simply ruined by this process. Keep them cool, on the 
ice if possible, and peel and slice them just before serving, 
when they will be crisp and delightful. 

String beans supply iron. One of our most valuable vege- 
tables, spinach, may be boiled and served cold with French 
dressing. It contains iron. Cabbage, cauliflower and spinach 
are all good for impoverished blood, and may be served as 
salads. Celery finds a place in many salads. It is a nerve 
food and overcomes rheumatic and neuralgic tendencies. 

The tomato is not only a delicious vegetable, but a valu- 
al)le one. Health authorities tell us that tomatoes stimulate 
the healthy action of the liver. 

Carrots form blood, improve the complexion, and boiled 
in salted water and cut into dice blend very well with other 
vegetables in a salad. Carrots and beets may be grated and 
sprinkled over many salads to advantage, adding a touch of 
color. 

Asparagus benefits the kidneys, and may also be served 
in various salads. 

Fruit salads are very good on hot days. They are palata- 
ble and are very easily made from any fruits in season. 

Nuts may be added to any salad. They are nourishing, 
tissue building, and by many are preferred to meat as a food. 

Pretty effects are gained by holloAving out one vegetable 
and using another as stuffing. 

"Left overs" come in very nicely for a hastily gotten up 
salad. A spoonful of cold peas, a chopped carrot, a few string 
beans and a bit of cauliflower may be mixed, a French dressing 
poured over it, and prove a very delightful, as well as econom- 
ical, addition to the menu.

My dear Mrs. Brebner: 

Your favor at hand. I was strongly tempted 
to give you as my recipe directions for eating 
radishes, of which I am very fond. I eat them 
with salt and butter and prefer the "White Icicle 
variety above all others. But lest this might not 
be regarded as a full compliance to your request, 
I beg to add the recipe for another of my favoriate 
dishes, viz: French Fried Onions. 

I first ate these at the famous Grove Park 
Inn, Asheville, N. C, and since that time have 
passed the recipe on to a number of friends as 
well as to dining car stewards. If you will take 
the large onion and cut it cross-wise, so that each 
slice will be made up of a number of rings, and 
then drop the rings separately into a thin flour 
batter and fry them as you would sliced potatoes, 
you will find them very palatable. 

I hope you may deem the humble onion 
worthy of a place in the book you are preparing. 

Very truly yours, 

W. J. BRYAN,

My dear Mrs. Brebner : 

Owing to my slow convalescence from a serious horseback 
accident, I am only able now to send you my favorite recipe. 
It is as follows : 

Pelotas a la Portugaise 

One quart can of tomatoes. Put in kettle on top of stove. 
Simmer or let boil slowly for 1^/2 hours. Add pepper, salt, 2 
onions cut in fine slices, 4 allspice and 4 cloves. The cloves 
and allspice to be added after it starts to boil. After 1^4 hours 
add : To 2 lbs. chopped beef add 1 onion chopped fine, 2 cups 
bread crumbs, a little parsley, salt and pepper. Make into 
meat balls about the size of a plum. Put into sauce and boil 
11/2 hours slowly. This makes fully 3 hours slow boiling for 
the sauce. Use a package or a pound of spaghetti, not maca- 
roni. Have a large pot of boiling water with about 1 table- 
spoon of salt. Slide the spaghetti into the water. Do not 
break it. Boil exactly 20 minutes. Must be tender, not tough, 
nor doughy. To sauce add 3 bay leaves 1 hour before taking 
off the stove. Serve spaghetti on large platter, pouring tomato 
sauce over it. Serve pelotas on smaller platter, allowing a 
small quantity of sauce to remain on them. Serve grated Par- 
mesan cheese on side. Use the piece of cheese to grate, not 
bottled cheese. This serves from 6 to 8 persons. 

Wishing you every success in your enterprise, 
Very sincerely yours, 

John Philip Sousa.

Dear Mrs. Brebner: 

Both my wife and I are only too glad to aid 
our ex-service men in any way we can. Neither 
of us, however, is very much of a cook, and I am 
afraid our recipes would not go very much further 
than the following : First take a potato, bake it, 
eat it. So I expect you will have to assign some 
delectable recipe to us and let us get by somewhat 
in the fashion of a camouflaged ship. 

With best wishes for the success of your book, 
which will earn, I hope, a great deal of money for 
the unemployed ex-service boys, I am, 

Yours very sincerely,

Baked Beans 

I received your letter of March 28tli this 
morning and am somewhat surprised that out of 
all the recipes that you have received none speak- 
ing of baked beans. How strange! Well, there 
are lots of things I do not know, but I do at least 
know "beans." I was born in Beverley, Mass., 
and people from there are called "Bevereley 
Beaners," because it is supposed that that was 
where baked beans were discovered. Much is 
heard of "Boston beans," but that is due to the 
fact that beans were first canned in Boston. They 
had to go to Beverley to learn how to bake them, 
however, before doing so. My old grandmother, 
who taught me how to bake beans, used to execute 
the process in the following way : Select a quart 
of white pea beans. Sort them well over and 
clear them of all foreign substance. Then, suppos- 
ing it is Friday night, place them in a basin of 
hot water, the water barely covering. Leave them 
there until the next morning. Then take an 
earthenware pot, preferably one of those enameled 
inside, but the then parboiled beans in the above 
pot, place a half pound piece of salt pork over. 
Through the top of the pork cut diagonal lines, 
just cutting through the rind. Next pour in water 
until it barely covers the pork, then place in a 
slow oven at say 8 o'clock in the morning and 
allow to remain there until about 5 in the after- 
noon. Stand guard over the door of the oven and 
shoot anybody who attempts to open the oven 
door for the purpose of pouring in water or other 
objects. When the beans are removed they will 
be found to be just what our old grandmothers 
used to bake and take pride in, and they knew 
better before or since what beans were, including 
your humble servant. 

Cordially yours, 

JOHN H. GROUT.

My dear Mrs. Brebner: 

Admiral Wilson has asked me, in accordance 
with your request, to enclose a recipe for creamed 
mushrooms, which he obtained during his tour of 
duty in France during the World War. It has 
been translated rather freely into English, but I 
think will prove satisfactory. 
With kindest regards. 

Sincerely yours, 
M. S. Tisdale, 
Lieut. Comdr., U. S. Navy, 
Aid to Superintendent. 

Champignons 

Peel the mushrooms and cut off the stems ; put in a sauce- 
pan over the fire until no moisture remains. When all the 
moisture is gone take off and drain well. Then fry them in 
boiling oil, with chopped onions and parsley. Sift in the pan 
a pinch of flour and stir for a few seconds. Serve the mush- 
rooms with a white sauce, made preferably with fresh, thick 
cream. Add salt and pepper to suit taste.

Madam : 

There is no Mrs, Dorsey, except my mother, 
Mrs. Ann Elizabeth Dorsey, who is 92 â€” almost 
100 years American, 

I don't know much about cooking, but I hap- 
pen to have with me a recipe for Lemon Meringue 
Pie such as I have eaten in my Maryland home 
ever since I can remember. It's 100 per cent 
American, alright, and mighty good. 

If this will be of use for your "100% Amer- 
ican Recipes" you are quite welcome to it (as well 
as to the Pumpkin Pie one which happens to be 
on the same sheet, and that I therefore enclose), 
especially if it can help a deserving ex-service man 
or his family. 

Very respectfully yours, 

W. RODERICK DORSEY, 

American Consul.

PAUL H. GRAM 

American Consul to Nancy, France 

NOTE : This is the only cake ever been known to be made 
without baking. 

Uncooked Fruit Cake 

One and i/^ lbs. of seeded raisins, i/^ lb. of dried currants, 
% lb. of dates, I/2 lb. of figs, % lb. of candied cherries, i/^ lb, 
of crystallized pineapple, i^ lb. of citron, % lb. of shelled 
pecans, 2 cups of oatmeal, l^/^ cups of wheat biscuit, 1 
cup of grape juice, 1 cup of thick blackberry juice, % cup 
of strained honey, 4 tablespoons of olive oil, spices to flavor 
well. 

Combine the fruit juices and drop into them a few pieces 
of cinnamon bark, a few whole cloves, allspice, and about an 
eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg. Place the mixture over 
a slow fire and allow it to simmer until it is well flavored with 
the spices. Do not let it boil rapidly at all, and, when flavored, 
remove it from the fire and strain through cheesecloth. 

Run the oatmeal and wheat biscuit through a meat chop- 
per before measuring. Reheat the fruit juice to the boiling 
point, and pour it over the cereals ; then cover it closely and 
set it away overnight. 

Prepare the fruit and the nuts as for the usual fruit cake. 
The currants will need washing through half a dozen waters 
and must dry overnight. If one prefers they may be left out 
and the same amount of some other fruit used instead ; but the 
flavor of the currant will repay one for the extra trouble of 
cleansing. The nuts are best broken into small pieces; the 
raisins, dates, figs, pineapple and citron cut into bits, and the 
cherries left whole. When ready to mix measure the honey 
and olive oil, and stir them into the cereals and fruit juice. 
Combine the nuts and fruits and work them into this, using the 
hands. The mixing must be done in a large pan so as to blend 
everything thoroughly. 

Line a pan with white paper brushed over with olive oil. 
Pack the mixture in this, a little at a time, pressing it down 
until it is perfectly solid. Decorate the top with nuts and 
cherries, and cover it with a paper brushed in oil. 

Put the cake in a covered bread tin and set it in a cool 
place for several weeks or longer. Several days before cutting 
it wrap it in a cloth wet with grape juice.

UNITED STATES SENATE 
Committee on the Library- 
March 20, 1922. 

My dear Madam: 

I received your letter of March 10th. I would 
be very glad to help you, but I don't know how to 
cook anything in the world except hard-boiled 
eggs, and I imagine everybody knows that. I can 
also make a cup of coffee, but when I do, I make it 
so strong that the dregs have to be drained out 
of it with cheesecloth. One good cup of it, though, 
threatens a man with delirium tremens. I don't 
think any of my recipes would help your book. 
My recipe for cooking hard-boiled eggs is to "put 
them in boiling water and then forget it." If you 
forget them long enough, they are hard-boiled. 

Very truly yours, 
JOHN SHARP WILLIAMS

remove seeds and chop lemons; add sugar and ginger root, 
and cook very slowly 6 hours. Pour into glasses and seal. 

GOVERNOR M. G. MECHEM, State of New Mexico 
Preserved Quince 

This is different from the kind that our mothers used 
to make, but is very palatable. The quince flourishes in New 
Mexico to an unusual degree, and the quality of the fruit is 
the finest of any on the market. In preparing this preserve 
always ask for New Mexico quinces. 

Take 12 large, ripe quinces and peel and quarter them, 
leaving the seeds and core, and boil in clear water slowly until 
tender. While hot, press them through a colander, or remove 
the seeds and cores and run the fruit through a meat grinder. 

To 1 cup of quince take 1 cup of sugar and mix in a 
granite ware kettle, and cook slowly about I/2 an hour, or until 
you are able to see the bottom of the kettle through the liquid, 
and if none of the mixture sticks to the pan it has cooked 
enough. Take it from the stove and beat it as you would beat 



148 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



an egg, continually, until it becomes cold, when it should be 
put in small molds, just large enough for serving 1 person. As 
soon as it has hardened it is ready to use. 

It is difficult to give exact directions for making this 
preserve, but if one acquires the art of it they will find it well 
worth the effort. 

U. S. SENATOR MILES POINDEXTER, State of Washington 

Chairman, Committee on Mines and Mining 

Orange Marmalade 

One grapefruit, 1 orange and 1 lemon. Slice the fruit 
peel and all ; to 1 cup of fruit add 3 cups of cold water, letting 
it stand over night; next day boil until the rind is tender, 
letting it again stand over night. To 1 cup of fruit add 1 cup 
of sugar. Let juice come to a boil and add sugar, letting it 
boil until it jellies. 

PRANK W. MAHIN 

American Consul to Amsterdam, Netherlands 

Raspberry Jam 

One and i/4 lbs. of sugar to 1 lb. of fruit. Put the sugar 
in preserving kettle and allow to melt slowly on the back 
of the stove, being careful it does not burn ; it will take several 
hours for the sugar to melt. When very hot add the rasp- 
berries and boil very fast 3 minutes, when it will be clear 
and ready to put in glasses. Currants or strawberries may be 
treated in the same way. 

Note : This method of making jam gives all the flavor of 
fresh fruit and beautiful color. 

U. S. SENATOR D. W. FLETCHER, State of Florida 

Orange Marmalade 
One orange, 1 lemon, and 1 grapefruit (thick skinned is 
best). Remove skins in quarters. Boil % of an hour; change

per. Slice the fruit, remove seeds, core ; mix with the peel and 
cover with 3 times its weight in water. Boil 1 hour. Add equal 
weight in sugar and boil 1 hour, or until the syrup is the color 
of amber and as thick as honey. Put into glasses ; cover with 
melted paraffine when cold.

your letter of March 15, 1922. I have been wait- 
ing for my property to arrive from Camp Dix, 
N. J., in which I have many valuable recipes gath-

the present time, this property is still somewhere 
en route. Hence, I will consider it a favor if you 
will put my name to one or more recipes that you 
may furnish to put in your book. 

"I heartily indorse your work, and I believe a 
book of this kind will bring in a good revenue to 
the dependent families and wounded of our late 
war. No doubt it will be both valuable to the 
people who buy such a book for the many valuable 
recipes contained therein, but, in addition, it will 
be a souvenir of this generation to the generations 
to come in that it contains the names of the dis- 
tinguished men of this time. I assure you that 
you have my hearty support, and you are at

Watercress is an excellent blood purifier. 

Lettuce has a soothing effect on the nerves and is excel- 
lent for sufferers from insomnia. 

Tomatoes are good for a torpid liver, but should be 
avoided by gouty people.

USES OF LEMONS 

The lemon is not sufficiently appreciated from a hygienic 
standpoint; for instance: 

Lemon juice removes stains from the hands. 

A dash of lemon juice in plain water is an excellent tooth 
wash ; it not only removes the tartar, but sweetens the breath. 

Lemon juice applications will allay irritation caused by the 
bites of insects. 

The juice of a lemon taken in hot water on awakening is 
an excellent liver corrective, and for stout people is better than 
any "anti-fat" medicine ever invented. 

Glycerine and lemon juice, half and half, on a bit of 
absorbent cotton is the best thing in the world wherewith to 
moisten the lips of a fever-parched patient. 

Lemon juice and salt will remove rust stains. 

For a manicure aid lemon juice is all that is necessary for 
loosening the cuticle and for brightening and cleansing the 
nails. 

Save your lemon rinds and dry them for kindling ; a hand- 
ful will revive a dying fire. 



HELPFUL HINTS 



COMMON WAYS OF COOKING FOOD 

Baking is cooking in confined heat in the oven. Examples: 
Bread, cake, meat. This method when applied to meat is 
commonly called roasting. Before baking, see that the 
oven is clean and heated to the desired temperature. 

Boiling is cooking by immersion in water at 212Â°. F. Exam- 
ples: Potatoes, cabbage, macaroni. 

Braising is a combination of stewing on the top of the range, 
and baking in the oven, with or without vegetables. Exam- 
ples: Tough meats, fowl, whole liver. 

Broiling or Grilling is cooking over or under direct heat, as 
over glowing coals or under a gas flame. Examples: 
Steaks, chops. 

Fricasseeing is commonly a combination of stewing and saute- 
ing. Examples : Fowl, f orequarter of lamb or veal. 

Frying is cooking by immersion in hot, deep fat. Examples: 
Doughnuts, croquettes. 

Pan-baking or Pan-broiling is cooking in a lightly greased or 
ungreased hot frying pan or griddle. Examples: Steak, 
English muffins, griddle cakes. 

Pot Boasting is cooking in an iron kettle or earthen pot in a 
small amount of water, after meat has been quickly 
browned in a small amount of fat in the frying pan or 
kettle. Cook slowly until very tender with or without 
vegetables. 



172 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



Roasting is cooking before an open fire. This method is seldom 
used in small households, although the baking of meats is 
commonly called roasting. 

Sauteing is cooking in a small amount of fat in a shallow pan 
on top of range. Examples: Sliced fish, meat, potatoes, 
eggs. 

Simmering is cooking in liquid at 185Â° F. The bubbles should 
always be below the surface. Examples: Ham, corned 
beef, soups. 

Steaming. Dry Steaming is cooking by heat or steam, as in 
double boiler or tin, over or surrounded by boiling water. 
Examples: Rice, brown bread. 

Moist Steaming is cooking by direct contact with steam, as in 
a steamer or colander, over boiling water, closely covered. 
Examples: Fowl, puddings, dumplings. 

Stewing is cooking slowly in a small amount of water (about 
160Â° F.) until food is very tender. Examples: Beef, 
lamb, vegetables.

WHEN COOKING OYSTERS 

Never salt soups or stews until just before removing 
from the fire. 

In frying oysters a little baking powder added to the 
cracker crumbs will greatly improve them. 

Escalloped oysters retain their flavor better if covered 
while cooking. 

Half the liquor, heated, or hot milk, may be poured over 
escalloped oysters when half baked. 

It is always better to handle oysters with a fork, as con- 
tact with the hands may make them tough. 



DIGESTIBLE CABBAGE 

Cabbage is made digestible by first slicing and then putting 
in boiling water with a pinch of soda and some salt, and boil- 
ing just 15 minutes. 



PRUNE DESSERT 

Soak prunes over night. Boil slowly until very tender. 
Sweeten to taste. When they have cooled in their own liquor, 
pierce one side with a pointed knife, remove the stone and 
fill with chopped nuts and raisins, mixed. Serve with whipped 
cream. 



TENDER PINEAPPLES 

The toughness of pineapples is almost entirely eliminated 
by slicing the fruit up and down, from stem to blossom end, 
instead of through the core as is usually done. Thrust a fork 
into the blossom end to hold the apple steady and slice until 
you come to the hard, pithy core, which can then be discarded. 
This trick was taught me by an old pineapple grower and 
makes all the difference in the world in the tenderness of this 
fruit, which is usually hard and chippy when sliced with 
instead of against the grain. 



THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 175 



POULTRY 

For market, dry picking is the best way â€” that is, pulling 
out the feathers immediately after killing, while the poultry 
is still warm, but for home consumption, the scalding method 
is quicker and easier. After killing dip in scalding hot water 
and move about for a few minutes, then pick as quickly as 
possible. Ducks should be scalded a little longer and then 
wrapped in canvas or any close cloth, to steam about 5 to 10 
minutes, after which the feathers can be easily pulled. The 
hairs should be singed off by holding and turning the poultry 
in the flames of a lighted twist of paper, or some burning 
alcohol. Wash thoroughly and dry, and then lay on several 
folds of paper, and clean at once. The quicker poultry is 
cleaned, the better, but it is best not to cook it until 24 hours 
after killing. 

After singeing, and before drawing, pull out all pin 
feathers, then elut off the head, and next cut through the skin 
around each leg, about IV2 inches below the first leg, being 
careful not to cut tendons. Place the leg with the cut over the 
edge of a table, press downward to snap the bone, then take 
the foot in the right hand, holding the bird firmly in the left 
hand, and pull off the foot, and with it the tendons. Make a 
lengthwise cut through the skin just below the breast bone, 
large enough to admit the hand, and remove the entrails entire, 
by first carefully loosening them all around, and then bringing 
the hand forward, grasping the entrails firmly, and with one 
pull drawing them out. The lungs and kidneys, on either side 
of the backbone, should next be removed, and then the wind- 
pipe and crop, close to the skin of the breast, by inserting two 
fingers under the neck skin. Draw down the skin and cut the 
neck off close to the body, leaving on enough skin to close up 
the opening after the crop is partly filled with a little dressing. 
The giblets (gizzard, heart and liver) should next be carefully 
separated from the entrails, being careful not to break the gall 
bag attached to the liver, the bile from which would impart 
an extremely bitter flavor to any parts it came in contact with. 
Then wash the bird thoroughly in and outside, rub with salt, 
and let hang in a cool place over night. 



176 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



CANNING PIE PLANT 

Pick when it is long and good, cut up and put in glass 
fruit cans, press down, cover with cold water, seal and put 
away. It will keep fresh until the new crop comes. In sections 
where the fruit is scarce, it can be easily raised, and is easily 
kept as described. 



PICNIC SANDWICHES 

Bake the bread in quart cans and press the chopped meat 
or chicken in cans of the same size. When both are cold put 
very thin slices of meat between two buttered slices of the 
bread. If your bread and meat are good, you will be proud 
of your sandwiches. 



WHEN BAKING 

If a handful of salt is put on bottom of oven under pans 
when baking ginger-bread or any cake easily burned, it will 
prevent burning. 

Putting a pinch of salt in the coffee improves the flavor. 



TO BOIL VEGETABLES 

When cooking lima beans, rice, etc., it is very provoking 
to have them foam and sputter from the kettle onto one's 
clean stove. Drop into the kettle a small lump of butter and 
there will be no "boiling over." 



OLIVE OIL IN BAKED BEANS 

Use 5 full tablespoons of olive oil to 1 qt. of dry beans. 
They are delicious and more easily digested than when pork 
is used. 



THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 177 



OATMEAL PIE CRUST 

Scald 2 parts of fine oatmeal with 1 part of of hot water ; 
mix well and roll thin. As this bakes very quickly, fruit which 
requires much cooking must be cooked first before making the 
pies. This crust is very tender, possessing all the desirable 
qualities of shortened pie crusts without their injurious effects. 



SAVE DRY BREAD 

If your bread becomes dry, do not throw it away; it is 
a part of Darby's hard earnings. Dip the dry loaf quickly 
into water, put in pan, place in oven and leave until crust is 
dry. The steam from the external moisture will enter the loaf, 
leaving it fresh as when newly-baked. 



TO KEEP TINS FROM RUSTING 

Tin vessels used in water often rust. This can be pre- 
vented by greasing well and heating in oven. They will not 
rust then, no matter how much used in water. Care should 
be taken not to bum the vessel. 



SEASONING A FOWL 

To improve the fiavor of fowl, when seasoning it, add 
ginger to the salt and pepper, and rub this into flesh well. 
For a change, try putting an onion and an apple in ducks in 
place of the usual bread-crumb dressing. 



KEEPING POTATOES IN WINTER 

To keep sweet potatoes through the winter perfectly, line 
a barrel with warm dry newspapers, side and bottom, then 
wrap each potato in paper and pack into it, till full, cover well 
and keep in warm, dry kitchen or any warm, dry room. A 
smaller quantity may be packed in a box in the same way, and 



178 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



kept in warm, dry atmosphere. To keep Irish potatoes in the 
cellar, sprinkle air-slacked lime among them; it seems to keep 
them dry and healthy. (As they are sorted, sprinkle a little 
in every layer.) 



VINEGAR IN DOUGHNUTS 

For doughnuts made with sour milk or cream, add a gen- 
erous half-teaspoonful of vinegar to the batter before adding 
the full amount of flour. 



BOILED LEMONADE 

In making lemonade, boil the desired quantity of sugar 
and lemon juice together, cool and add as much cold water as 
needed â€” a great improvement on the old way. 



SUBSTITUTES FOR ALCOHOL IN MINCE PIE 

Instead of cider and other alcoholic liquors, use fruit juices 
for mince pies. The juice left from canning strawberries, sour 
feherries, plums, etc., if sweetened, boiled down and canned, 
makes a rich, delicious moistening for mince meat. If raisins 
and suet in plenty are added to the mixture, it will be rich 
enough to please the most fastidious appetite. 



A COOKING HINT 

Turn the colander upside down over the fish or meat 
sauteing in an iron spider; the small holes allow the steam 
to escape and still prevent the grease from spattering. 



BAKING DAY 

After taking bread from the oven, do not wrap tightly in 
cloth as many do ; but rub the top of loaves with a little lard 



THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 179 



or butter, tip on edge on your kneading board so that all 
possible crust is exposed to the air and if possible place out- 
doors or in the wind to cool quickly a few minutes, then 
remove to convenient place and let stand until thoroughly 
cold before putting away in box or can, and you will have 
delicious, tender crust. 



PREVENTS SOGGY PIE-CRUST 

Pie-crust will not be soggy if brushed over with the white 
of an egg before the fruit is put in. 



CARE OF WOODEN BOWLS 

To prevent wooden bowls from splitting, take them when 
new, before they have been touched with water, applying boil- 
ing hot linseed oil over the outside and top edge, all that will 
penetrate. 



FRIED SQUASH 

Cut a fine-grained, dry, sweet squash into thin slices, pare 
and fry in plenty of butter and season well. This dish will 
be found an excellent substitute for sweet potatoes. 



TO SAVE PLANTS 

To prevent bugs from eating your cucumber vines, plant 
one stalk of garlic in each cucumber hill; nothing will then 
bother the plant. 



TESTING FLOUR 

There are several methods of testing flour, which should 
be known to every purchaser. If flour is white with a yellow- 
ish straw tinge, it is good, while if it has a bluish cast, or has 



180 THE ALL-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 



black specks in it, it is inferior. 

Wet and knead a little of it between the fingers; if it 
works soft and sticky, it is poor ; if elastic and firm, it is good. 
If a little flour is thrown against a dry, smooth surface and it 
falls like powder, it is not of the best quality. If flour squeezed 
in the hand retains the shape given it when released, it is of 
good quality. 



USES OF BUTTERMILK 

Should you be so unfortunate as to be poisoned by poison 
ivy, bathe the affected parts in buttermilk every 10 or 15 
minutes until the poison is counteracted. Should the case be 
a severe one, poultice the blisters with bread and buttermilk 
poultice. It will give relief very soon and will cure the most 
severe cases. 

Buttermilk will remove mildew from cloth, white or col- 
ored. Soak the garment over night, then lay it on the grass 
in the sunlight. If the stain is set, soak the cloth for two 
or three days and lay it in the sun. 

Buttermilk is excellent for freshening salt pork for frying. 
Slice the pork and soak over night, or set on stove and let it 
come to a boil, dip in flour and fry.

"Dear Madame: 

"Referring to your letter of August 1st, which reached me 
but a day or so ago, I am sorry to say that I am not able to 
comply with your request to furnish you my favoriate recipe, 
because I pay so little attention to the question of food that 
I eat what comes to me and ask no questions. 

"If there is any one dish that I would specially desire 
above all others, it would be an Irish stew." 



LEGATION OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

AMERICAN CONSULATE 
Dairen, Manchuria 

March 3, 1922. 

My dear Mrs. Brebner: 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your let- 
ter of January 12, and hasten to send a recipe 
of Mrs. Kirjassoff 's, which is one of my favorites. 

Chicken Pilau 

This is an Indian dish, often mentioned in 
Thackeray's novels (Thackeray was bom in Cal- 
cutta), which is very popular with all Americans 
and Europeans who visit India. 

I trust that the book you contemplate will 
have great success. My wife and I thank you for 
this opportunity to have even a small share 
therein. 

Very sincerely yours, 

Max D. Kirjassoff. 

Chicken Pilau 

One medium sized chicken, i/4 cup concentrated pan gravy, 
1^ cups rice, 5 cloves, 1 stick cinnamon, butter size of an egg, 
Yo cup seedless raisins (boiled for 5 minutes and with water 
drained off), i/^ cup almonds (blanched and browned), 1 onion 
cut in strips and fried in butter until crisp and brown, 2 hard- 
boiled eggs. Bake the chicken until tender, preserving the 
gravy. Boil rice in salted water together with the cloves and 
the stick of cinnamon. "When half cooked, remove spices, drain 
off water, and complete cooking by steaming. When finished 
the rice must be dry with each kernel separate. Mix butter 
with the rice, together with the pan gravy and raisins. Make 
a mound of the rice in the center of a platter. Sprinkle with 
almonds and the fried onion and garnish with the hard-boiled 
eggs cut in halves. Cut the chicken for serving and arrange 
the pieces around the mound of rice. 

This is a most delicious dish, and the rice prepared in 
this way has a very rich, exotic flavor. 



MAJOR GENERAL J. A. LEJEUNE 

Commandant U. S. Marine Corps 

"Pain Perdue" (Lost Bread) 

"This is a favorite dish in Louisiana where Gen. Lejeune 
was born and reared." â€” Mrs. J. A. Lejeune. 

One loaf of bread (a day or two old), and in slices i/4 inch 
thick, 3 eggs, 3 tablespoons of sugar stirred together, and 
1 or 2 tablespoons of lard. Have the lard very hot ; dip slices 
of bread in the egg mixture and fry brown on each side. 



WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT 

Chief Justice, Supreme Court, former President of the 
United States 

Rolled Chops 

Cut egg plant into rounds, roll them in egg and bread 
crumbs, and fry. Take loin chops, cut thick, and roll them 
into rounds, putting a tooth pick into them. Broil them and 
put them on the egg plant and pour truffle sauce over them. 
(See sauces.) 



1923 IS COMING 

This years' book of 1922 is closed and sealed at last 
Nor would I alter what is past. 
My work, my pleasures, thoughts and acts, 
Are all on record as plain facts. 
But here before me pure and white, 
Are pages for recipes of 1923 to write. 
More recipes from these same donors will I borrow, 
And start the " All- American Cook Book" of tomorrow.
